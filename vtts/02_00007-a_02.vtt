WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:03.516
How many?

00:03.937 --> 00:05.040
Freshmen?

00:05.060 --> 00:05.461
Freshmen.

00:05.501 --> 00:05.641
28.

00:05.662 --> 00:06.805
28.

00:07.366 --> 00:12.541
And the total number in those days of an outfit, total enrollment would have been about how many?

00:12.621 --> 00:12.942
60?

00:13.784 --> 00:15.730
About that, yeah.

00:15.830 --> 00:17.635
Describe for me

00:17.615 --> 00:20.618
a typical academic day's routine.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.603
What time did you get up and what did you do when and so forth?

00:24.623 --> 00:31.992
Well, we marched to breakfast at 7, and we were in class by 8.

00:33.073 --> 00:37.278
In fact, we may have had even some 7 o'clock classes.

00:37.318 --> 00:38.279
I can't remember.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.060
It was a long day.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.361
I know that.

00:40.382 --> 00:45.968
But we went to class at 8.

00:45.948 --> 00:51.178
and spent really most of the eight to five time in class.

00:51.879 --> 00:59.073
And we also had Saturday morning classes.

00:59.093 --> 01:03.903
And occasionally you'd have an hour between classes free.

01:04.384 --> 01:05.486
What would you do with that hour?

01:05.726 --> 01:08.732
Well, if you were a freshman, you were supposed to go back to your room.

01:10.062 --> 01:10.883
Did you do that?

01:13.868 --> 01:24.565
We had, incidentally, we had our class schedule posted on our doors, so everybody knew when everybody was supposed to be there, or anyone was supposed to be there.

01:24.585 --> 01:33.640
But I do remember that the pre-med chemistry course had one hour less of a lab than the major chemistry course.

01:34.801 --> 01:42.380
And I had inadvertently put down the extra hour on my schedule.

01:42.801 --> 01:46.490
So I had one hour a week of total freedom.

01:47.452 --> 01:51.763
And when I was in high school, I'd worked at the library, at the Cushing Library.

01:51.743 --> 01:58.415
In those years I had closed stacks and somebody had to go back and get the books for a person.

01:58.435 --> 02:02.181
And so I was familiar with the library and the people knew me.

02:03.203 --> 02:11.237
And so I would go back into the stacks and find a desk, and there were occasionally at the end of the

02:11.217 --> 02:19.229
an area where a faculty member or a student had a desk for study or reading.

02:19.249 --> 02:28.483
And so I would put my head down on the desk and I would sleep or nearly sleep for an hour.

02:28.852 --> 02:41.517
The main thing I remember after the first year was we were always so tired, you know, because you had all the schoolwork and you had that military work and you had the freshmen's activities.

02:41.537 --> 02:41.657
Right.

02:41.677 --> 02:43.501
Now, what were those freshmen activities?

02:44.723 --> 02:51.096
Well, actually, I spoke of going to Mess at 7 in the morning.

02:51.076 --> 02:58.007
Prior to that, we had made up our bed and cleaned up, straightened up our room.

02:58.027 --> 03:08.865
Then I went down the hall, as the other freshmen did, to an upperclassmen's room and made up the two beds in that room and straightened it up.

03:08.905 --> 03:16.898
Then we fell into formation and marched to breakfast.

03:18.903 --> 03:24.032
And I can't remember if we did the same thing at noon, but we did in the evening, too.

03:25.655 --> 03:30.584
But you were pretty much the servant of an upperclassman, or any upperclassman.

03:31.486 --> 03:32.828
Do you recall?

03:33.044 --> 03:41.579
either involving you or any of your acquaintances, any pranks from those days that were?

03:41.699 --> 03:52.337
Well, I remember one of the happiest moments of my life was when I, there was one day that the freshman had a chance to sort of get even with the upper glassman.

03:52.357 --> 03:52.698
Okay.

03:52.818 --> 03:56.925
It was so nice to have a dirty,

03:57.800 --> 04:01.987
sort of garbage can sort of thing, half full of water and throw it on a sophomore.

04:02.387 --> 04:05.913
That was a very pleasant moment for me.

04:05.933 --> 04:09.258
And was there a particular sophomore that was the target?

04:09.418 --> 04:13.905
I don't remember who it was, but it was more because he was there than he was.

04:14.105 --> 04:15.227
You say it was more than that?

04:15.728 --> 04:17.831
No, he was just available.

04:19.113 --> 04:23.520
Well, do you remember anything that you or anybody else pulled off that was really special?

04:24.648 --> 04:26.730
No, not really.

04:28.972 --> 04:32.415
I might add that the upperclassmen used the board some.

04:32.495 --> 04:35.498
It was not just constant in our outfit.

04:35.778 --> 04:38.921
We had one of the better outfits from one of the freshmen.

04:39.501 --> 04:41.603
What would be the occasion of their using the board?

04:41.663 --> 04:51.312
Well, if they felt that you were not doing what you wanted to do, what they wanted you to do, or if they just started to beat somebody, you know.

04:51.352 --> 04:54.655
And then at the end of the year,

04:54.635 --> 05:04.128
you had your sole handle beaten off, meaning you weren't called fish anymore.

05:05.169 --> 05:11.197
And you had to have two or three upperclassmen sort of, I guess, beat it off.

05:12.179 --> 05:12.299
Right.

05:12.319 --> 05:15.123
Now your dad came back to the campus when?

05:15.143 --> 05:15.223
Hmm?

05:15.243 --> 05:15.744
He came back.

05:16.224 --> 05:19.529
Your dad is back on campus at the time you were a freshman.

05:19.549 --> 05:20.270
Yes.

05:20.290 --> 05:20.690
Yeah.

05:20.710 --> 05:23.494
Did anybody ever give you a hard time

05:23.474 --> 05:26.606
because of you being a faculty brat?

05:27.910 --> 05:30.801
Well, I can...

05:33.245 --> 05:34.407
Yes and no.

05:36.571 --> 05:48.671
Dad, at the time of the legislature investigation of the A&M in the spring of 1947, he was one of the administration witnesses.

05:48.691 --> 05:58.527
And I can remember being sort of sarcastically treated by an upperclassman, but not in my outfit, because Dad was, of course,

05:58.507 --> 06:03.612
Obviously, he was just not in favor of physical hazing.

06:04.233 --> 06:20.649
And as commandant, in the previous decade, he had been fairly successful in controlling it, actually, but with a lot of student reaction to that.

06:21.190 --> 06:27.096
And so I had grown up in that sort of background.

06:27.076 --> 06:31.882
And I can remember that one occasion when somebody was really pretty sarcastic.

06:32.683 --> 06:42.255
But generally, I might have even been treated a little more with kid gloves occasionally.

06:42.275 --> 06:45.079
Now, your dad became Commandant when?

06:46.380 --> 06:48.643
He became Commandant in 1935.

06:48.663 --> 06:49.464
1935.

06:49.945 --> 06:52.628
And so he serves until he goes away to the...

06:53.958 --> 06:54.699
To the war?

06:54.719 --> 06:56.362
No, he was that for two years.

06:57.023 --> 06:57.644
Oh, okay.

06:57.664 --> 07:06.938
And actually his policies of control of hazing were such that there was sort of a student rebellion.

07:08.300 --> 07:13.027
Not leaving classes or anything, but a very strong reaction.

07:13.347 --> 07:15.831
And the board

07:17.178 --> 07:21.024
I think preferred to keep things from not rocking the boat.

07:21.725 --> 07:33.625
And so after two years as commandant, he actually went to the physical education department and served as a professor of physical education in those years.

07:33.705 --> 07:37.431
But one of the interesting things is

07:37.411 --> 07:56.297
Having been here for 15 years before he became commandant, and also as a coach having seen sort of the student element of life, that had really some progressive ideas.

07:56.277 --> 08:12.278
For example, if the student's in an outfit, he tried to get this over to the company, the battery commanders, that, you know, if you have distinguished students, you should give them a little more time.

08:12.258 --> 08:22.309
And there was apparently only one unit in the whole corps that went along with this, but it led the corps academically, freshman.

08:22.449 --> 08:33.001
And in that sort of rough and rowdy time, there was not a small amount of furniture torn up and destroyed.

08:33.021 --> 08:35.143
In fact, I can remember going with Ed.

08:35.123 --> 08:38.467
I was sort of tagging along with him one day when he inspected a room.

08:39.168 --> 08:44.915
This was after the semester was over, but somebody had just torn up everything in it.

08:45.816 --> 09:03.898
And the second year, they instituted a plan in which all the money is saved, or at least one of the two years, all the money saved from not having to replace things would be set aside to buy special things

09:03.878 --> 09:08.543
equipment or whatnot that the students would use.

09:09.505 --> 09:14.871
And apparently, you know, there was a substantial saving affected by that.

09:15.932 --> 09:28.907
And he also instituted a rule in which you had to pass a certain number of hours to be allowed to stay in a dormitory.

09:31.452 --> 09:38.642
which was sort of an effort toward making people academically achieved.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.546
Now, the number of hours was like six.

09:41.566 --> 09:47.515
I mean, by our standards now it would just be sort of funny, but at that time it was not so funny.

09:49.137 --> 09:56.447
And the problem that occurred was that the son of one of the directors did not make that level.

09:56.427 --> 10:03.899
And a dean came to dad and said, so forth, sons, he's not being allowed to stay in the dormitory because of this rule.

10:03.940 --> 10:15.339
And dad would not relent on it, and apparently then the president was talked to, and he decided it'd be better to change the rule.

10:15.359 --> 10:18.604
Now, your dad was

10:19.040 --> 10:22.005
Am I correct in remembering that his nickname was Colonel Andy?

10:22.166 --> 10:23.588
Yes.

10:25.151 --> 10:29.799
Throughout his later years, from the 30s on?

10:29.819 --> 10:30.741
Yes, that's right.

10:32.404 --> 10:40.238
The, back to your own case, did you all refer to roommates as fish old ladies?

10:41.230 --> 10:45.717
Did you have a roommate who was your fish old lady?

10:45.737 --> 10:52.889
Well, yeah, I don't think, Bill Eccles and I didn't use that term too much, but that's a term that's used, yeah.

10:53.330 --> 11:00.201
Did you all have any, I'll say game, did you all have any games you all played at meal time?

11:00.569 --> 11:16.063
Any routines that were... Well, as a freshman, you had to serve the upperclassmen, and you'd serve them more or less in order of their seniority.

11:16.043 --> 11:24.654
I know to my left at the end of the table there was a junior, and then the sophomore was on my right, so the junior would be passed everything first.

11:24.674 --> 11:28.199
And the freshman did the passing.

11:28.219 --> 11:32.825
And so the freshman got what was left over.

11:32.845 --> 11:40.735
And we were not allowed to have desserts at all.

11:40.715 --> 11:47.163
unless the University of Texas was beaten in football, which never happened, of course.

11:48.345 --> 11:51.930
So we didn't have desserts.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.854
And we had to eat.

11:55.795 --> 11:59.580
They wanted to sort of let us know we were still freshmen.

11:59.920 --> 12:08.832
In addition to serving, we would eat a square meal, which basically meant you had to raise your fork vertically from the plate

12:08.812 --> 12:17.643
and then turn a right angle and it got to the level of your mouth and then go to the mouth and then so forth down and so on.

12:17.663 --> 12:25.152
Did, during that time, what is your recollection of the quality of the food that was served?

12:26.834 --> 12:27.976
I think it was satisfactory.

12:28.396 --> 12:29.597
It was not bad, no.

12:29.918 --> 12:34.704
Do you have any recollections of what your favorite main course was or courses?

12:35.405 --> 12:37.367
What did you enjoy most?

12:39.322 --> 12:41.484
I don't really recall, Haskell.

12:41.604 --> 12:43.166
I don't know that I had a favorite.

12:43.186 --> 12:47.511
Do you remember any that was particular at the other end of the scale that you really didn't like?

12:47.651 --> 13:03.948
Well, it was sort of volume food and sort of a lot of hasher, pudding, and of course, pudding was more dessert, but I mean even for the... Now, were you eating in Duncan or Cebiza?

13:03.968 --> 13:05.329
Duncan Hall.

13:05.917 --> 13:06.418
And let's see.

13:06.899 --> 13:13.651
And you said that the other day that it was, as far as you know, it was pronounced Sbisa.

13:13.672 --> 13:14.192
Sbisa.

13:14.373 --> 13:14.513
Uh-huh.

13:14.533 --> 13:15.976
Sbisa.

13:16.878 --> 13:17.338
Let's see.

13:17.939 --> 13:24.812
And did you all have an outfit that was a, was your rival?

13:25.393 --> 13:27.317
Was there anybody that your,

13:27.297 --> 13:29.579
was kind of paired against?

13:29.739 --> 13:32.622
No, not that I recall.

13:33.462 --> 13:48.576
We lived, at least as a freshman, I mean, the second floor of dormitory, too, was my almost whole environment.

13:48.616 --> 13:56.983
The quartermasters were below, and the coast artillery was above us.

13:56.963 --> 14:04.915
A freshman didn't attempt to walk in those areas if he could possibly avoid it, and we had no real rivalry with them.

14:05.376 --> 14:19.157
In those years right after the war, was there any outfit that you recall now that had highest prestige and any that had the other end of the lowest prestige?

14:19.137 --> 14:32.527
Well, I think probably F Company Infantry probably was the quintessential cadet corps company when I was there, when I was a freshman.

14:32.547 --> 14:35.273
And a former drill instructor was the

14:35.253 --> 14:37.658
company commander.

14:38.319 --> 14:51.624
And Benny Zinn, whose dad was a student in the dean of men's office, his dad had been, I think, a lieutenant colonel in the war, was in F infantry.

14:51.705 --> 14:56.113
And that was a, they were a lot

14:56.093 --> 15:03.326
on their freshman than F battery or most of the artillery.

15:05.249 --> 15:10.278
I think a lot of the people in the artillery were people who were trying to get a college education.

15:10.318 --> 15:16.569
I think some of those other units, sometimes some question about that.

15:16.589 --> 15:20.295
How did life for a student change as a sophomore?

15:21.608 --> 15:27.661
Well, actually, after my F battery was dismantled after my first year.

15:27.681 --> 15:30.347
And I went home and just lived at home after that.

15:30.387 --> 15:35.057
And I was theoretically assigned a B battery, which is an excellent unit.

15:35.899 --> 15:39.988
But I didn't show up for drill too often.

15:39.968 --> 15:41.891
That was not one contact with them.

15:41.911 --> 15:45.597
Were you happy with that arrangement to live at home?

15:45.617 --> 15:45.717
Sure.

15:45.737 --> 15:45.837
Yeah.

15:46.278 --> 15:51.105
Were, was there a nickname in those days for a cadet that lived off campus?

15:51.666 --> 15:52.928
Yeah.

15:53.248 --> 15:56.013
A cadet who lived off campus was called a Day Duck.

15:56.033 --> 15:56.954
It was a Day Duck then?

15:56.974 --> 15:57.455
Okay.

15:57.475 --> 16:05.487
Now, I never considered myself a Day Duck since I'd been a freshman on campus, because I'd paid my dues, so to speak.

16:07.154 --> 16:34.242
A minute ago, I said something about the artillery, and my dad, when he was at Fort Sill, who was, in addition to going through the two artillery schools, at least intermittently, president of a board that reviewed cases of people who wanted to transfer from one part of the military to another, and also interviewed young men who wanted to go to officer candidate school.

16:34.222 --> 16:56.415
And Hal Carr, who was a distinguished alumnus of A&M, and later became president of an airline, told me that he went for the board that my dad was president of, wanting to change from the artillery to the Air Corps.

16:58.117 --> 17:03.530
and probably was fortunate he did because his career later was in aviation.

17:03.871 --> 17:12.611
But he said that my dad said to him, Lieutenant, why could you possibly want to leave the artillery?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.518
This is the branch of Napoleon.

17:18.907 --> 17:28.199
And Dad's view of at least the ground forces was that there were three parts of the army one would want to be in.

17:28.219 --> 17:34.547
The artillery, the infantry, and cavalry, or armored as it was called.

17:35.688 --> 17:39.954
And he felt that the dumb guys went in the infantry and the army.

17:39.974 --> 17:40.635
That was his view.

17:41.736 --> 17:42.857
His view of the army.

17:42.877 --> 17:47.243
Now he did accept the engineers and the medical corps, but beyond that, that was it.

17:49.535 --> 17:57.866
As you look back on those undergraduate years, were there some memorable teachers, advisors that had an important role in your life?

17:59.208 --> 17:59.848
Well, yes.

18:06.057 --> 18:12.905
Mr. Brayton, who taught freshman chemistry, was just an awfully nice person, and he did a good job of teaching it, too.

18:12.925 --> 18:17.972
It may have been Dr. Brayton, but Mr. and I liked him.

18:20.112 --> 18:30.774
He initiated that, I presume, at least was director of it for years.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.982
Dr. Potter was a pre-med advisor, and he

18:38.928 --> 18:49.226
In fact, his graduate anatomy course, the sophomore course, was sort of the one that decided whether or not you were going to medical school almost.

18:49.246 --> 18:50.629
And I thought he was a good teacher.

18:50.669 --> 19:01.408
He did not cut corners, and he didn't expect the students to either.

19:03.160 --> 19:19.905
In the non-sciences, I might mention Dr. Gravett, who later became a pre-med advisor, taught me embryology, and I thought he was quite a gentlemanly person and a very good teacher.

19:20.846 --> 19:31.362
He later was my patient, and Dr. Potter had passed away when I came to practice, but Mrs. Potter was my patient for 20 years, I guess.

19:32.152 --> 19:35.496
I liked Ralph Steen.

19:35.536 --> 19:36.837
He taught Texas history.

19:37.198 --> 19:40.401
I thought he was a stimulating teacher.

19:40.421 --> 19:41.482
What made him such?

19:41.543 --> 19:44.045
I've heard many words of praise.

19:44.065 --> 19:45.167
What was it that he did?

19:45.867 --> 19:49.371
He was a rather business-like person.

19:49.391 --> 19:59.863
I mean, you know, he was not casual at all, but he was well organized, and he just said a lot of interesting things, you know.

19:59.843 --> 20:04.950
But he got your attention and kept it, too, I might add.

20:05.111 --> 20:07.594
It was interesting to the student.

20:09.076 --> 20:12.862
Harrison Hurst taught me Shakespeare.

20:12.882 --> 20:15.045
He was a very nice teacher, a very good man.

20:16.067 --> 20:22.476
Of course, you know him in church.

20:24.194 --> 20:36.647
One person who did not teach me, but who I remember, because one of his classes was across the wall from a German class I took, was Al Nelson.

20:37.690 --> 20:40.397
I was going to guess that's who you were going to revert.

20:40.377 --> 20:49.210
And my German teacher was a Mr. Rothrock, who was a tiny, just a very small person, very thin and very not tall at all.

20:50.051 --> 20:56.861
And I can remember once Dr. Nelson, I don't think he liked to be called doctor, but he was.

20:57.301 --> 21:04.191
But when he was making, he could, his voice could attain a high level, I mean like a

21:05.892 --> 21:18.398
screech or scream or certainly a shout, and just, you know, within a word almost, you know, and this high volume suddenly increased next door, and Mr. Rothrock went to the blackboard and banged on it.

21:18.459 --> 21:21.505
I remember that, but it didn't stop the noise at all.

21:22.598 --> 21:27.987
But Al Nelson was later my patient as well as Mrs. Nelson, and they had cataracts and surgery.

21:28.027 --> 21:35.299
And over the period of time, I knew him as a patient who we talked about a lot of things.

21:35.319 --> 21:41.670
And I mentioned that my father grew up reading the Hinty books.

21:42.983 --> 21:54.867
And he was an English author and wrote historical books for young boys.

21:56.197 --> 21:59.442
And I read all Daddy's Hindi books and enjoyed them.

22:00.123 --> 22:10.879
And then Dr. Gowen's lived next to us in our second house, and Dr. Gowen had grown up on the Hindi books and had kept them just as Dad had.

22:10.899 --> 22:17.108
And so I read all of his.

22:17.088 --> 22:23.394
At some point I decided I wanted to read, you know.

22:24.175 --> 22:26.677
They were among my favorite ones.

22:26.758 --> 22:36.227
And then later Mrs. Walton, I used to go down and go through their library, and of course they'd had two sons, so they had all the books from them too.

22:36.247 --> 22:46.437
But going back to Al Nelson, I mentioned something about the Hindi books, and he said that they were the books that caused, and he had them,

22:46.417 --> 22:48.441
They had kept them.

22:49.403 --> 22:55.133
They were the books that had pointed him toward history.

22:55.574 --> 22:59.101
Really?

23:00.103 --> 23:06.214
After he passed away, Mrs. Nelson lived a few years.

23:07.426 --> 23:09.209
I have his hitty books.

23:09.229 --> 23:10.210
Oh, yes.

23:10.251 --> 23:12.154
How marvelous.

23:12.694 --> 23:13.496
She gave them to me.

23:14.297 --> 23:29.822
But do you remember any, this would be kind of non-class work, do you remember anybody who was important to you as an advisor, a counselor?

23:30.612 --> 23:36.819
Well, Tommy Mayo actually advised some, gave me some advice about what I might read.

23:37.400 --> 23:52.317
I remember the first book was Benvenuto Cellini, which was his autobiography.

23:52.297 --> 23:56.322
He was very nice.

23:56.382 --> 23:57.063
I liked him.

23:58.345 --> 24:02.130
Of course, he was the head librarian when I was working there as a student.

24:02.150 --> 24:07.997
Describe him, because his career is long and very important to A&M.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.421
I know nothing about what he looked like or anything.

24:11.441 --> 24:17.229
Describe him physically and emotionally and so forth.

24:17.249 --> 24:19.772
I would say he was

24:21.558 --> 24:33.851
about six feet tall and not thin, but not overweight markedly by any means.

24:33.871 --> 24:48.527
He may have been a slight, you know, sort of actually just an average physique, but maybe a little on the slightly chubby side, but not grossly overweight at all.

24:48.507 --> 24:51.031
a person who was not overbearing at all.

24:56.438 --> 25:06.753
Really, in a crowd, probably a fairly quiet person, but I think a very good conversationalist among friends and so forth.

25:07.975 --> 25:16.928
Of course, he had a literary bend, obviously with being a professor of English.

25:18.190 --> 25:31.407
The library I know had a music room that I think was largely due to his influence and the students of that era could go up and check out symphonies and that sort of thing.

25:31.707 --> 25:33.349
You mean records?

25:33.369 --> 25:35.212
Records, yes.

25:35.232 --> 25:41.059
There was a room set aside for that that I think was entirely his

25:41.039 --> 25:51.437
an indication of his interest in bringing cultural circumstances to the student body.

25:51.878 --> 25:56.506
Can you generalize about his leadership style as a librarian?

25:58.269 --> 26:01.093
He was not a hands-on leader.

26:02.035 --> 26:06.102
I think he more or less

26:08.090 --> 26:22.453
indicated to his staff in the library, and I think probably in the English department, because he was head there too, not necessarily at the same time.

26:23.851 --> 26:29.862
I had the impression he delegated things to people, but people knew what they were supposed to do.

26:30.142 --> 26:33.889
He was not one of these people who was looking over one's shoulder all the time.

26:34.951 --> 26:47.293
Now, a little aside to this of a later nature is that when he died, Dad and Luther Jones were their co-executors.

26:48.269 --> 26:55.160
And he had apparently just a lot of mail, U.S.

26:55.180 --> 27:05.356
postage mail, that had not been opened over, you know, two years or something like that.

27:05.376 --> 27:09.202
And sometimes it'd be a check, you know.

27:10.103 --> 27:15.812
But he didn't bother with the mundane things of that nature.

27:15.792 --> 27:21.179
Now, was his personality affected at all by where he grew up?

27:21.280 --> 27:22.681
Was he southerner, northerner?

27:22.702 --> 27:24.664
Yes, he was a Mississippian.

27:25.806 --> 27:34.318
I think may have grown up in Oxford, where I think the State University is, and was a Rhodes Scholar later.

27:34.938 --> 27:36.280
Boy, I didn't know that.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.322
A Rhodes Scholar?

27:37.822 --> 27:38.323
Yes.

27:38.303 --> 27:41.747
I came here.

27:42.187 --> 28:05.492
His mother was a rather dominant person and apparently must have outlived her husband many years, and so he took care of his mother for probably 20 years or something, which I think probably sort of limited his contacts and social sense outside of what she would be interested in at least.

28:05.725 --> 28:09.087
Now the YMCA, when you start,

28:09.657 --> 28:13.721
was the kind of the activity center of the campus.

28:13.741 --> 28:15.122
Yes.

28:15.202 --> 28:17.924
What all happened at the Y?

28:17.944 --> 28:28.093
Well, among the activities, among the things they had for activities, were ping pong tables in the lobby.

28:28.113 --> 28:31.757
And I became really quite a good ping pong player playing there.

28:32.758 --> 28:37.842
And when we finally moved off campus,

28:37.822 --> 28:43.354
A large porch was constructed, large enough for a ping pong table.

28:43.374 --> 28:44.837
So I continued my interest.

28:44.857 --> 28:51.190
But we played ping pong there many, many hours.

28:52.115 --> 28:59.823
Of course, I mentioned the swimming pool, which, incidentally, there was a swimming pool in the basement of the YMCA prior to my memory.

29:00.864 --> 29:06.329
And then I remember a bowling alley being there, but I was not too interested in bowling.

29:06.349 --> 29:10.813
But I never played, I guess, maybe played one time or something.

29:10.833 --> 29:15.358
But the kids used to roller skate around that area and on the sidewalks.

29:15.458 --> 29:19.882
And Mr. Cashin was the director in your memory.

29:19.902 --> 29:20.122
Yes.

29:20.543 --> 29:21.784
And then followed by?

29:23.722 --> 29:24.644
Was it Gordon Gay?

29:24.664 --> 29:26.467
Gordon Gay would have been next, yeah.

29:26.487 --> 29:37.646
And I think that more or less completed the YMCA time because the Memorial Student Center took over the functions of the YMCA largely as time went on.

29:38.147 --> 29:43.536
Now, the MSC construction begins about when?

29:43.516 --> 29:46.319
It began about the time I graduated.

29:47.240 --> 29:47.720
So about 1950?

29:48.822 --> 29:52.626
Somewhere in the 49, 50 area, maybe 51.

29:53.547 --> 29:59.953
I remember being there, if it weren't for a dedication, it was for some event when there was a groundbreaking of some sort.

30:00.734 --> 30:08.342
And I don't recall if I were back from med school on the weekend, on a Saturday or something,

30:08.542 --> 30:10.204
But it was more or less about 1950.

30:10.865 --> 30:13.189
Were people excited about the coming of the MSC?

30:13.429 --> 30:14.651
Well, I don't know.

30:14.691 --> 30:16.093
There must have been, yes.

30:16.253 --> 30:25.487
I mean, I was not sort of participating in all that, but it was a wonderful thing and a wonderful, you know, it offered so many

30:25.467 --> 30:32.457
It just expanded both the recreational and later the cultural element of the university.

30:32.938 --> 30:38.927
Do you remember any great events, great in your life at Guyon Hall?

30:40.269 --> 30:47.841
I remember when I was in medical school, Randolph Churchill spoke, the son of the prime minister.

30:49.022 --> 30:53.449
At that time, he was, oh, I don't know, 40-something, I guess.

30:53.429 --> 31:03.243
And the one thing I do remember specifically was that he stated that he thought socialized medicine was a good idea.

31:04.825 --> 31:08.830
And, of course, he came from a more conservative element of society.

31:08.910 --> 31:17.122
But I think the English had decided that the services were more continuous for the whole population.

31:17.843 --> 31:23.250
People were not physically, financially, I mean, overall.
