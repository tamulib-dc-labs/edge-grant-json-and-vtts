WEBVTT

00:06.680 --> 00:23.362
I would like to begin this interview by saying that 
my name is Charles Weiss and that I am interviewing

00:06.680 --> 00:23.362
my grandfather, Mr. John Addicks, who is 
currently living in the Salem community, which is

00:06.680 --> 00:23.362
located on Route 3, Brenham, Texas. This 
interview is being conducted at his home on July

00:25.145 --> 00:34.898
30, 1976, and the time is 7.45 p.m.

00:40.514 --> 00:42.256
Okay, Grandpa, are you ready? Yes. Okay. First, 
I'd like you to give me a little information as to

00:45.019 --> 00:51.846
where you were born, in what, and in what year.

00:55.890 --> 01:06.040
I was born on August the 22nd, 1891, at Warrington, 
Fett County, Texas. Were you born in your house?

01:09.488 --> 01:12.052
And if so, did the doctor come to your house? Yes. He 
did come to your house? Yes. Okay. Just how long ago

01:18.060 --> 01:21.065
did your family come to that area? I'm referring to 
your mom and dad. It must have been about

01:25.611 --> 01:30.859
ten years or so. I see. Do you know why they decided 
to come to that area?

01:38.969 --> 01:41.512
Times were too difficult in Germany. Oh, I see. 
They were from Germany then. Yes. I see. Are there a

01:47.798 --> 01:52.443
lot of German people in that area? Yes, nothing but 
Germans. Oh, I see. Do you have any brothers or

01:57.549 --> 01:59.391
sisters?

02:02.714 --> 02:05.277
I have no brother, but I have one sister. She's 
dead, too. I see. Did you start school in

02:08.348 --> 02:14.298
Warrington or in Round Top? I started school at 
Rocky Hill, Texas. Rocky Hill, Texas. Just where

02:20.750 --> 02:21.731
is that? Oh, that's the country school right close 
to Warrington. Okay. Just how did you get to

02:30.146 --> 02:31.689
school? Walked it. How far did you live from the 
schoolhouse? Oh, I guess about a mile and a half,

02:35.964 --> 02:39.207
two miles. Did you have any other means of 
transportation, such as when it was raining or

02:40.668 --> 02:49.035
anything of that sort? No, we had to walk. I see. Can 
you tell me something about the schoolhouse, such

02:54.459 --> 03:03.567
as was it a one-room schoolhouse, or how many 
teachers were there? Something to do with that

03:04.272 --> 03:05.874
line. It was a one-room schoolhouse, wooden, not 
sealed. Taught, I believe, four readers, not

03:16.144 --> 03:23.272
grades at that time. Four readers? Yes. What do you 
mean exactly by readers? Well, readers, we call it

03:28.177 --> 03:31.460
grades now. In those days, we called those 
Readers. First reader, second reader, third

03:36.368 --> 03:41.095
reader, fourth reader. So in a sense there was one 
teacher to four readers. Yeah. I see.

03:50.889 --> 03:57.899
Back then, what kind of activities did you do in 
your leisure time, such as when you were young?

03:58.340 --> 04:00.823
What kind of activities did you do? Like now we go 
out for ball games, to see ball games, to watch

04:01.259 --> 04:08.249
football games. We have TV now, which you didn't 
have back then. Just what exactly did y'all do?

04:17.483 --> 04:20.227
Oh, chiefly hunting. Uh-huh. And not too often 
either. Uh-huh. Fishing once in a while. I see.

04:30.537 --> 04:37.606
What about maybe something like picnics on 
Sundays and things of that nature? We didn't have

04:38.807 --> 04:40.730
any picnics. I see. What did y'all do on holidays, 
such as Easter and Thanksgiving, Christmas,

04:42.672 --> 04:49.360
Fourth of July? We didn't do anything. Sometimes 
we worked. I see. Did you have any... Well,

05:00.052 --> 05:04.096
whatever celebrations you had, it was carried on 
in the house. That's right. I see. Back then, do you

05:07.859 --> 05:13.884
remember any fads or any fashions that were kind of 
popular for that time?

05:19.329 --> 05:25.454
The boys had to wear knee pants.

05:25.614 --> 05:27.977
Anything else, I don't know. Okay. How about 
dances? Were they popular back then? That's the

05:32.342 --> 05:34.444
only entertainment we had. I see. Dances. Okay. 
Could you tell me a little bit about the first job

05:38.789 --> 05:45.756
you had and maybe what kind of pay that it had? The 
first job was teaching at Wellcome. Wellcome of

05:53.645 --> 05:56.248
Austin County. I received $45 a month and had to pay 
$15 for a board. So I had $30 left. That's not very

06:07.709 --> 06:10.773
much now compared to what we have now. I forgot to 
ask you back, where did you graduate from school to

06:12.335 --> 06:25.172
get your teaching degree?

06:27.532 --> 06:37.443
I got my certificate at Blaine College for taking 
the examination, the state examination. That was

06:38.284 --> 06:46.933
in 1960, I think, on April 8th and 9th, if I remember 
right, in 1916. 1916, I see. Just how long were you a

06:50.437 --> 06:54.041
teacher in the public schools? At that place? One 
year only. Then I was drafted to the United States

07:00.330 --> 07:06.958
Army, Army of Occupation. How many years did you 
serve in the Army? I served about 22 months.

07:17.131 --> 07:18.213
You went overseas? Yes, sir. I see. Spent about one 
month, I mean about one year overseas. Uh-huh.

07:28.855 --> 07:33.501
When you came back from the Army, did you take up 
teaching again? Yes, sir. And you taught where? I

07:37.146 --> 07:40.049
taught at Salem, Washington County. For how many 
years? I taught 44 years. I see. 44 years. Then I got

07:49.061 --> 07:52.645
two years credit for military service. Makes 46 
years. That's a long time. Just when did you get

07:57.796 --> 07:59.497
married?

08:02.260 --> 08:05.563
That was 1922. 1923. Okay. Got married. And just 
where was she from? From Wonder Hill, Washington

08:15.531 --> 08:19.795
County. Small community. I see. And just what 
exactly was your reason for moving here? The

08:25.559 --> 08:27.381
teaching job? What was your reason for moving to 
where you presently are staying now? Was it your

08:34.379 --> 08:35.320
job? It was the biggest school. I see. And I had the 
principal's job over here. Oh.

08:44.793 --> 08:49.058
Just what kind of work did your... You said you had a 
sister. Just what kind of work did she do, or where

08:49.139 --> 08:54.646
did she move to when she was married? She stayed... 
at Warrington, Texas all of my life. Farmer's

09:00.090 --> 09:01.071
wife. Okay.

09:04.897 --> 09:07.721
What other kind of work did you do besides 
teaching? Did you raise cattle or what other kind

09:07.801 --> 09:12.188
of farm? I raised some cattle.

09:17.095 --> 09:20.179
Did you raise anything like cotton or corn? Yes. I 
think all my life I raised one bale of cotton. I see.

09:28.330 --> 09:30.052
Just how big was your farm? We had 150 acres at last. 
I see. But now we have 72 acres left.

09:43.772 --> 09:48.979
Did you grow most of what you needed or did you buy 
quite a bit from town? I think we bought quite a

09:50.101 --> 09:53.646
number of things from town.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.893
Tell me something about the Depression. How did it 
affect you and others around you?

10:06.501 --> 10:09.865
Depression started in 1929.

10:13.869 --> 10:19.555
We thought it would be over in just a few months, but 
it lasted a long time. I think it wasn't over in

10:19.575 --> 10:23.059
1939.

10:24.440 --> 10:40.438
Did you feel any real hard effects from it, such as 
where you—I

10:24.440 --> 10:40.438
don't know how to say it—did you feel that there was 
a shortage of food or a shortage of a lot of things

10:24.440 --> 10:40.438
around here? Well, not exactly around here. You 
see, we lived on the farm, and we didn't notice it so

10:43.361 --> 10:47.706
much. But in larger cities, they had quite a bit of 
trouble. I see.

10:56.755 --> 11:13.070
Since you mentioned that you were a teacher, how do 
you think that the conditions have changed since

10:56.755 --> 11:13.070
the time that you've gone to school or since the 
time that you were teaching school, more so than

10:56.755 --> 11:13.070
the size of the school? Maybe tell me a little bit 
about how you think maybe the... Well, in 1939,

11:27.502 --> 11:39.734
I think it was in 1930, no, 1919, when I started 
teaching, we had 39 common school districts in the

11:27.502 --> 11:39.734
county. Now we have two school districts left, and 
both were independent school districts. They all

11:48.964 --> 11:56.131
have been consolidated.

11:56.812 --> 11:56.952
Uh-huh. When you taught school, how many teachers 
were teaching in that particular country school,

11:57.455 --> 12:10.249
and how many grades did each one teach? We had Salem 
and Pleasant Hill, we had four. We started out with

12:16.696 --> 12:22.703
two, and later on we increased it to four. Four 
teachers? Yes, four teachers. I see. And each one

12:27.508 --> 12:30.792
had how many grades? They taught maybe two grades 
for each teacher on the hour? Yes. First we had to

12:35.218 --> 12:41.425
teach four grades, and then later on taught under 
two grades. I see.

12:45.350 --> 12:47.593
I remember having to go to... when we went out from 
Pleasant Hill the last few years that it operated,

12:48.164 --> 12:59.076
and I think I had, was note, remembered that it was 
two grades to each teacher, mainly also.

13:04.683 --> 13:08.447
Do you travel very much, or did you used to travel 
very much? No, not so much, not anyhow. Maybe

13:12.447 --> 13:19.517
to other towns when you did, nearby towns? Yes, we 
did that all right. Go to neighboring towns. For

13:26.968 --> 13:30.032
maybe just to visit? Yes, just to visit. I see. I 
guess Houston has always been a pretty big town

13:33.657 --> 13:36.882
around here. Yes.

13:42.788 --> 13:46.052
Have you ever been out of Texas besides for the war? 
And for what reason did you go? No,

13:48.654 --> 13:52.018
sir. Never was out of Texas. I always stayed in 
Texas. That's

13:56.823 --> 14:04.572
Shreveport. It was just a little bit, too.

14:11.898 --> 14:13.200
Do you have any children? Yeah, two. Two? Could you 
tell me where they have moved to and what's the type

14:16.885 --> 14:24.296
of work that they are doing now?

14:27.421 --> 14:31.026
Well, we have a boy and a girl.

14:36.574 --> 14:39.438
And a girl works in a tax office. Uh-huh. Here in 
Brenham? Yes. And the boy works in Houston as a

14:44.002 --> 14:49.729
certified public accountant.

14:53.634 --> 14:56.978
They were raised up here in this area right here? 
Yes, they were raised here. Okay.

15:03.526 --> 15:10.474
Backing up to what we were talking about, the war 
and its effect, on the United States. Do you recall

15:14.256 --> 15:23.547
anything that

15:14.256 --> 15:23.547
people usually tried to do to contribute to the war 
effort? Like I know of in larger cities or so that

15:24.167 --> 15:33.659
they went to the factories and helped increase 
factories. Well, they bought war bonds. War

15:36.342 --> 15:37.023
bonds? Yes. Could you tell me a little bit about 
these war bonds? Why they were created? What way

15:45.282 --> 15:46.304
they helped? That's directly to the government. 
The government needed money, and they gave them

15:49.628 --> 15:54.074
the bonds for it. Do you have any war bonds with you? 
No, we don't have any left. But you did have some?

16:06.190 --> 16:06.550
Yes. When you bought these bonds for a certain 
amount of money, they reimbursed you the same

16:07.643 --> 16:14.011
amount of money? Yes.

16:19.999 --> 16:36.199
Do you recall anything unusual about any of the 
presidential campaigns or elections besides the

16:19.999 --> 16:36.199
ones we've had here recently, such as the 
Watergate scandal and...

16:37.394 --> 16:38.797
Anything to that nature? No, I don't remember 
anything in particular.

16:47.132 --> 16:55.607
Except President Wilson made a promise that I'd 
keep you out of the war, World War I. Just as soon as

16:56.508 --> 16:59.233
he was elected, he was for it. I see. Do you remember 
any particular disasters or floods or tornadoes

17:03.179 --> 17:14.434
that's happened in this area or any surrounding 
area? Well, we had a storm at Galveston. We had a

17:21.304 --> 17:23.887
hailstorm in 1950. It was in 1960, 1950.

17:30.618 --> 17:31.780
They were pretty bad. Do you remember a lot about 
Galveston, the storm there in, you said 1900?

17:38.269 --> 17:39.110
1900? Yes. It killed about 6,000 people, I think. I 
see. This hail storm that you mentioned in 1950,

17:47.662 --> 17:57.756
just exactly what it was, that was just a little bit 
before my time. Did that happen in this area? That

18:01.472 --> 18:05.556
happened exactly in our community. We had to put a 
new roof on our house. I see. It must have been

18:09.780 --> 18:11.222
pretty bad then. Do you remember a lot about 
Hurricane Carla? I know that was in 1962, I guess,

18:17.088 --> 18:22.093
somewhere back then. I remember a little bit about 
that. I guess that's no comparison to the other

18:26.017 --> 18:28.840
two. No.

18:38.589 --> 18:42.675
Do you ever remember having any problems among 
students in class? I mean, in controlling them or

18:43.417 --> 18:53.212
anything related to that idea? Never. Problems. 
However, we had them off and on, though,

18:59.043 --> 19:05.111
especially when the parents took up for the 
children. I see.

19:13.442 --> 19:17.126
Can you tell me something about integration? When 
did it come in, and what promoted it to come in?

19:24.696 --> 19:27.700
Well, it was brought on by the federal government. 
We were forced to integrate. That happened here

19:33.186 --> 19:36.371
about seven, eight years ago, I think. You never 
witnessed any of it when you were teaching then?

19:41.379 --> 19:41.860
No, sir. That was after my time. Uh-huh. Do you 
remember any type of racial problems? Did we have

19:52.316 --> 19:56.843
any racial problems in this area, do you think? The 
integration first came in. I don't think we did.

20:02.010 --> 20:04.473
There was hardly any opposition then to it. No. I 
think that took place when I was about in the sixth

20:07.178 --> 20:19.497
grade, and it really didn't take over until when I 
was a freshman, I believe. So I never witnessed

20:20.519 --> 20:22.442
anything either.

20:25.595 --> 20:28.699
Just what type of people are living in this area 
now? I mean, are they of German descent or any other

20:29.079 --> 20:38.270
type of... Chief of German descent. Uh-huh. And 
what type of work do they do? Are there large farms

20:42.315 --> 20:47.281
or do they have other type of jobs? Well, in 1919, 
all of the people worked on the farms to raise corn

20:47.701 --> 20:54.910
and cotton. No one had jobs in town, but now 
everyone has a job in town. Not only one, but the

21:05.191 --> 21:07.433
whole family. And no cutting is raised anymore, 
and no corn. That's changed entirely. Then mostly

21:17.121 --> 21:22.046
the type of farms that are around here are for 
cattle raising? Yes, cattle raising.

21:26.699 --> 21:36.192
Just what kind of technological changes have you 
seen in farming in the last few years or in the last

21:26.699 --> 21:36.192
decade or so?

21:41.439 --> 21:42.260
I don't know. I've seen too many. I mean, back when 
you raised cotton and everything, pretty well

21:45.104 --> 21:54.597
everything was done by...

21:55.353 --> 21:56.735
Walking cultivators. Now they have tractors. 
Everyone has tractors on the farm. Have you

22:05.828 --> 22:21.990
noticed anything else significantly besides 
that there are no crops being raised anymore and

22:05.828 --> 22:21.990
types of equipment? No, not exactly.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.082
People can't afford to own land anymore. It's too 
expensive. Do you think a lot of people are doing

22:31.766 --> 22:49.073
this cattle raising as a side business, that they 
have other jobs connected with it, or do you think

22:31.766 --> 22:49.073
that it's mainly their one occupation in this 
area? It's not their chief occupation. They do

22:52.525 --> 22:59.713
that besides the jobs they have in town.

22:59.733 --> 23:02.316
Do you think that this area is getting larger? And 
what I'm referring to in this area is Brenham. Have

23:08.904 --> 23:13.249
you noticed a great change in size in the last few 
years? Yes, I think so. It's getting larger. Just

23:19.556 --> 23:21.098
what type of... Do you think businesses account 
for this growth, or just what exactly do you think

23:22.107 --> 23:37.244
is a major cause for all these people coming here 
and staying more now so than what they did before? I

23:37.504 --> 23:39.947
think they have more factories in Brenham. Such 
as? Cotton factory, mattress factory.

23:51.858 --> 23:53.480
And there are quite a number of others. These 
weren't here 20 years ago? The cotton factory was

23:57.566 --> 24:02.073
here a long time ago.

24:04.977 --> 24:08.882
But as far as Sealy Mattress, they haven't been 
here as long. No. I see.

24:14.410 --> 24:17.815
Just what type of changes have you noticed in the 
landscape? like roads and buildings. Have you

24:22.088 --> 24:26.635
noticed quite a bit of changing taking place in 
this area? Well, out of the country, we haven't

24:26.795 --> 24:30.100
made many changes. We still have dirt roads.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.916
I guess you've seen a lot of changes on the 
highways. Oh yes, the highways are fixed up. Were

24:44.802 --> 24:47.346
there any major highways? say 25 years ago around 
here? 25, I believe the first one

24:50.753 --> 25:01.687
was the highway that runs from Burton to Chapel 
Hill. That was the first highway built in the

25:02.769 --> 25:05.232
county. But I don't know exactly when it was built. 
And later on Highway 36. Then it made Fountain

25:14.804 --> 25:17.367
Market Roads. They weren't made before the 
highways then. They were put in... No, a little bit

25:21.081 --> 25:24.244
later on. I see.

25:33.772 --> 25:40.838
Do you notice any real big changes in the way kids 
are raised now as compared to when they were young?

25:41.638 --> 25:44.100
Or maybe to the way you raised your children? Oh 
yes, quite a bit of difference. In what way? They

25:51.482 --> 25:56.828
sent them to school much longer nowadays. They had 
to go nine months. In those days, some went six

26:00.352 --> 26:09.142
months, some seven, and then they had to stay at 
home and work on the farms. So they were let out then

26:10.764 --> 26:15.469
early in spring. That's right.

26:22.383 --> 26:27.971
I guess you notice there's a lot of difference in 
the way they go to school now also. Oh yes, that's

26:29.554 --> 26:31.236
right. Pretty well, everyone walked to school. In 
those days, everybody had to walk.

26:43.454 --> 26:49.183
I imagine when you were young that,

26:43.454 --> 26:49.183
well, What you listened to mainly was programs on 
the radio. Do you remember any special programs

26:53.611 --> 26:59.179
back then that you always listened to? I don't 
think we had any radios.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.310
I don't think I remember that we had any. When do you 
think they first came? Radios came later on first.

27:14.059 --> 27:16.943
Do you have any particular idea that you can... as 
to what date that you can associate with it, maybe,

27:17.682 --> 27:23.208
that you first noticed? We didn't have anything to 
listen to. Uh-huh. And radios haven't been here no

27:28.454 --> 27:32.578
more than about 30 or 40 years. Yeah, that's right. 
How long was it before you got your first TV? Do you

27:40.327 --> 27:41.068
remember?

27:46.333 --> 27:47.014
Oh, that's... Pretty good while ago, I know. Say 
maybe 20 years or 30 years? I believe every bit of

27:54.148 --> 27:57.551
it, if not longer. Did many people have one when 
they first came out, or was it just the wealthier

27:58.733 --> 28:09.502
people that had them that was more available? I 
guess the wealthier were the first ones to get

28:09.522 --> 28:15.668
some, but after a while all the people bought them.
