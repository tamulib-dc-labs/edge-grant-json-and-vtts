WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:07.339
Petroleum engineering, all my dad could see of 
that was more oil patch. And my brother was

00:07.760 --> 00:16.172
successful as a petroleum engineering student 
and went to work for the old Humble Oil Pipeline

00:07.760 --> 00:16.172
Exxon. And then when I let dad know I wanted to go to 
A&M, he was very much for that. And he and mother

00:21.981 --> 00:25.026
made a lot of sacrifices. trying to save up money to 
assist us in coming to A&M. But I had worked some and

00:30.095 --> 00:35.986
had tried to save up money, and I had the 
valedictorian scholarship. How much was it then?

00:37.989 --> 00:38.631
Oh, goodness. It paid your basic tuition, and 
that's all it paid. I think tuition was $250 a

00:44.762 --> 00:47.807
semester back then. It was not much, but it was, it 
helped, I can assure you that. But as far as

00:53.434 --> 00:57.258
spending money, no, it was fairly frugal. And I, 
you know, most of the other fish were pretty much in

00:57.759 --> 01:03.946
the same. And how often did you contact parents? 
Writing or phone calls? You know, as much as I

01:09.692 --> 01:12.576
could. I had... I had become a ham radio operator in 
high school. And W5AC, the old radio station at

01:19.484 --> 01:29.185
A&M, Ham Radio Club, I joined the, and that was one 
of the things that you, It's where you could get

01:29.418 --> 01:31.262
away from the other things. You could belong to the 
committees over at the MSC and the student groups.

01:36.872 --> 01:40.459
And I became a member of the ham radio club. And I 
could talk to a ham in Atlanta, which is 13 miles up

01:40.700 --> 01:50.599
above McLeod, and all on the same telephone 
exchange. And I could call this ham in Atlanta, and

01:50.579 --> 01:55.086
they'd phone patch me down to my mom and my dad. They 
were on a party line, but we usually could get

01:55.387 --> 01:58.712
through. And so a couple times a week, I talked to 
home via ham radio on a phone patch. And did you

02:05.143 --> 02:08.208
write very much, or was primary? Yes, no, we wrote, 
wrote a lot. My two precious sisters kept me going.

02:15.268 --> 02:20.617
They wrote religiously, wanting to know what was 
happening to baby brother and what he was doing.

02:20.677 --> 02:23.402
Did you drive home before Thanksgiving? Haskell, 
one time illegally. We're not supposed to go. The

02:33.239 --> 02:45.951
weekend of the Fort Worth Corps trip, TCU, Jim 
Stewart, who was a senior civilian, okay, he was a

02:33.239 --> 02:45.951
civilian student in civil engineering. And Jim 
and I decided to make an excursion through McLeod

02:45.991 --> 02:59.685
to

02:45.991 --> 02:59.685
go by home just real quickly and maybe even find a 
girl or two to take to Fort Worth with us. And we had a

03:00.706 --> 03:02.908
car wreck. And no real serious injury. Oh, I 
complained of a little bit of a back problem for a

03:08.285 --> 03:13.176
while, but... Wasn't that Studebaker? No, no. Jim 
was driving. He was a senior, and his folks were...

03:21.772 --> 03:22.855
fairly well off. And Jim was driving a fairly new 59 
Ford Galaxy. And we were driving from McLeod going

03:29.212 --> 03:36.793
to go back up through uh... the Atlanta area known 
to uh... to finish up our trip and then we had the

03:36.773 --> 03:51.889
wreck and of course then we got caught because I 
spent a couple of days uh... in the hospital and

03:36.773 --> 03:51.889
uh... had to call back the A&M and say goodbye. What 
kind of punishment did you get in the outfit? They

03:54.792 --> 03:59.937
were uh... they were sympathetic to the extent 
that uh... I uh... I came back a little bit uh...

04:00.198 --> 04:04.502
bunged up and what have you and uh... They did not 
really want to take advantage of the situation of

04:04.482 --> 04:09.168
coming down on me too hard. They

04:09.308 --> 04:16.696
let me know that I had done something that I was not 
supposed to do. Did you make the other Corps trip

04:16.897 --> 04:18.699
that year? Austin or Houston? Haskell, I think 
maybe it was Rice. I don't remember exactly. Yes, I

04:25.307 --> 04:29.151
made the Corps trip, sure did. On a typical Corps 
trip, where did you and your buddies stay? As

04:35.262 --> 04:36.165
freshmen? Particularly as freshmen. Like if you 
went to Houston, do you remember where you stayed?

04:43.129 --> 04:45.217
In Houston, I would stay. I had a... By that time, I 
had a sister in Houston, in fact, in Houston, and I

04:47.125 --> 04:53.714
would stay with her. And there was not a lot of 
staying because, you know, you went to the game and

04:54.776 --> 05:07.193
maybe you could spend that one night and then you 
had to be back in before quarter quarters the next

04:54.776 --> 05:07.193
day. And so there was not a lot that went on, really. 
How, on court trips all of your years, How were

05:14.412 --> 05:21.283
Aggies treated during the march and so forth by the 
typical spectators? Oh, gosh, Haskell, they came

05:21.383 --> 05:33.624
out by the thousands and lined the streets and 
hollered at you and applauded, and the old band go

05:21.383 --> 05:33.624
by, and people would just go bananas. It was no 
shouting, ridicule, or anything like that.

05:38.211 --> 05:39.373
Aggies were treated with Oh, I thought utmost 
respect on those Corps trips. I thought we were

05:43.772 --> 05:45.353
kind of treated special. Gosh, the Aggies are 
coming to town. Let's fall out for them. Let's line

05:48.978 --> 05:50.720
the streets for them. Oh, I can remember 
photographs of those Corps trips and seeing

05:50.740 --> 05:56.286
those. And my brain has just gone to sleep. I hadn't 
thought about this. When did Corps trips stop? I

06:08.201 --> 06:08.901
don't remember. Do you? When they stopped?

06:15.533 --> 06:17.075
I don't know that they ever stopped. Well, did they 
go on until the Southwest Conference was

06:18.216 --> 06:28.128
terminated about 10 years ago? I don't even know. 
Maybe they don't have any court trips now, none at

06:29.389 --> 06:34.015
all. That has, I've gone to sleep. That's passed me 
by. With SMU, TCU, and Rice gone. Yeah, where do you

06:40.117 --> 06:41.883
go for? The only other would be UT or Baylor. And the 
Baylor stopped. I don't know Haskell. In all of the

06:48.423 --> 06:52.988
interviews, I have not gotten any negative on 
court trips. No, it was fun, and we were treated

06:53.008 --> 06:57.893
with tremendous respect. And I was also in the 
singing cadets. As a fish? No, I started singing

07:04.460 --> 07:08.104
cadets my second semester of my sophomore year. 
We'll get to that in a second. Yeah. During that

07:11.609 --> 07:15.977
freshman year, you went to Yale practice. Oh, yes. 
Was it midnight, or was it earlier in the Grove? It

07:20.486 --> 07:24.113
was in the Grove, and it was right after chow, the 
best I remember. Haskell, I think it was just right

07:24.173 --> 07:28.301
after chow, and it was at the Grove. How did people 
behave? Oh... rowdy, a lot of hollering, but no

07:32.399 --> 07:40.127
foul language to speak of, and no drinking. Did 
they tell fables? Oh, goodness, yes. And they were

07:43.210 --> 07:45.892
halfway clean fables. I mean, they would imply 
some impropriety, but nothing just real bad. Oh,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.081
no, I remember those well, yeah. Then No worse than 
the Jody calls that we had marching around camp.

08:01.456 --> 08:04.982
Well, we had Jody calls, and we'd get called down 
every once in a while. The Bulls would send word

08:05.002 --> 08:09.490
down no more of those Jody calls, you know. Did you 
all have a rival outfit, core outfit, that you were

08:09.630 --> 08:15.160
always kind of competing with, playing? Haskell, 
I guess every one in what was called the second...

08:19.902 --> 08:33.148
brigade over there, you know, A-2, B-2, C-2, D-2, 
E-2, F-2, G-2, and the H-1 was real screwing that it

08:19.902 --> 08:33.148
was assigned to that second brigade. It never was. 
It was always assigned to second brigade. I guess

08:38.785 --> 08:52.207
there was some competition, especially for 
precision in marching and those sort of things,

08:38.785 --> 08:52.207
but it seemed like most people wanted to do things 
over at Henderson Hall where the jocks were. You

08:52.828 --> 08:59.479
wanted to go over to Henderson Hall and put ink in 
the swimming pool or whatever you could do to kind

08:52.828 --> 08:59.479
of shake those guys up. Did you ever get caught in 
any kind of a prank and get a punishment? Like

09:05.077 --> 09:08.724
putting some ink in or caught a Babbo bomb? I was 
involved in a couple of drown outs in one Babbo bomb

09:10.207 --> 09:15.558
incident. And what? That was not caught on any of 
them and denied any involvement. Used somebody

09:20.648 --> 09:27.000
else's trash can on the drown out, you know, 
instead of using your own. It wasn't smart to use

09:26.980 --> 09:30.565
your own. It traced you back to where it came from. 
Only two things that I thought were questionable.

09:41.722 --> 09:45.627
Charlie Rollins, our first sergeant, there was a 
junior Yale leader. I want to say that boy's name

09:47.350 --> 09:49.373
was Sonny Todd. I can't remember his name. Maybe it 
was Sonny Todd. We were told to... If we ever had a

09:57.119 --> 10:12.135
chance to catch Sonny Todd to take a mattress 
cover, you know, our bedding, our mattresses, we

09:57.119 --> 10:12.135
were furnished by the Corps a mattress cover. And 
to take him and put him in that mattress cover and

10:12.936 --> 10:19.563
tie it up good and put him four or five feet up the 
flagpole. And we did that. And it didn't hurt the

10:22.043 --> 10:27.154
guy, but he didn't know exactly how high he was off 
the ground. He did not want to flounce around too

10:27.836 --> 10:30.462
much. I think that happened in the first water 
fight we had as a fish. The second water fight is

10:35.533 --> 10:40.845
probably the one where I made a dumb mistake. In 
retrospect, it didn't really hurt anybody. And as

10:43.347 --> 10:51.194
a more mature student, I would not have done it and 
certainly would not advise anyone to do it. But in

10:51.214 --> 11:03.905
our second water fight, my fishy old lady and I, we 
were chasing, I believe, this same EL leader who

10:51.214 --> 11:03.905
Charlie wanted us to get again. And he ran to the 
door of the guard room at the end of dorm 14. and was

11:10.002 --> 11:13.887
able to get into the guard room before we could get 
any water on him. And I turned around and there was a

11:14.928 --> 11:19.434
bull, Colonel Scott. And Colonel Scott was called 
the Goose. That was his nickname, the Goose. I

11:24.681 --> 11:30.949
turned around and the Goose was almost face to face 
with me and I poured water on him. And ran and went

11:30.969 --> 11:35.335
around and came in the side door 14. And Charlie 
Rollins hid me in his closet while the goose went up

11:36.428 --> 11:46.288
and down every hallway in 14, 15, 16, trying to find 
who it was pouring water on him. And I could pass

11:46.368 --> 11:54.184
Colonel Scott on the sidewalk, and I would very... 
I would salute him, and it was, good morning, sir,

11:54.620 --> 11:58.184
good afternoon, sir. And I know that he would say, 
I've seen that fish somewhere before. That

12:03.150 --> 12:06.994
probably was as much a... You never got caught on 
that one? Never got caught on that one. No one told.

12:09.217 --> 12:10.298
Rollins didn't tell. All right, on a serious side 
of Good Bull, were you and some of your buddies ever

12:10.638 --> 12:23.513
involved in a prank which now in hindsight you 
realize was dangerous? Yeah, we threw M-80s when

12:25.079 --> 12:33.681
we weren't supposed to throw M-80s, could have 
blown hands off and blown toes off, a lot of things.

12:34.583 --> 12:38.734
I was present when M-80s were flushed down the 
crappers.

12:40.233 --> 12:44.958
That could have, you know, you could have hurt 
people doing those sort of things. I tried to put a

12:45.379 --> 12:52.807
guy up a flagpole, you know, even though it might 
not have been four or five feet was probably not the

12:45.379 --> 12:52.807
best judgment in the world to use, but we did it. 
Describe you and your buddy's role in Bonfire your

12:53.768 --> 13:00.576
freshman year. I had it made. My buddies worked 
their tails off, and their whole job, of course,

13:03.993 --> 13:10.000
was just to carry logs out. That's all they got to 
do. I stayed on the radio the whole time because I

13:12.744 --> 13:22.476
was a ham radio operator, and I was in the 
communication tent from day one to day in. About

13:22.796 --> 13:27.302
how long did bonfire preparation take? Oh, I don't 
remember it being more than a month. I would think

13:31.752 --> 13:35.838
more in terms of two to three weeks, maybe. And 
where was the cut area? Do you remember? Oh, no, I

13:39.183 --> 13:40.425
really don't. I could not even begin to tell you 
where the cut area was then. It was still on the

13:43.810 --> 13:45.312
drill field. Still on the drill field. How did you 
feel when you saw that fire? Oh, it was amazing. I

13:52.943 --> 13:55.707
mean, just magnificent. You know, it was... I did 
not associate it so much with that desire to beat

13:57.571 --> 14:04.322
out of TU. I didn't associate it with that near as 
much as I did, my goodness, look what we've put

14:04.482 --> 14:11.754
together and look what we're doing. Yeah, it made a 
lasting impression on me and will never forget my

14:13.136 --> 14:19.487
first one. So when you go home, Christmas that 
first year. Are you feeling pretty good about

14:25.844 --> 14:28.109
being an Aggie? Haskell, I was when I got home. And 
the toughest time of my life, until today, was the

14:31.636 --> 14:42.799
Christmas break of my fifth year. I had had that 
little accident, and like I say, it didn't slow me

14:43.994 --> 14:48.545
down much. Got through bonfire because I was in 
communications anyway. I got home, and you know,

14:54.620 --> 15:02.138
back in those days, you came back after Christmas 
to take final exams. And they had about a week of

15:05.809 --> 15:11.455
class, maybe two weeks of class after Christmas, 
and then a week of final exams. And I thought I was

15:11.575 --> 15:17.220
reasonably prepared to come back and finish up the 
semester. And like I would say, I was just an

15:17.320 --> 15:20.123
average student. I was making B's and C's and not 
really tearing anything up. But I got home and No

15:28.713 --> 15:30.957
sweetheart or anything else involved. I just got 
home, and home looked so good. And, you know, Mom

15:35.284 --> 15:38.650
and Dad looked so good. My

15:38.710 --> 15:47.886
youngest sister, I mean, those things, it was just 
so emotional to go home. and really spend some

15:48.203 --> 16:00.002
time, because that was essentially about it, you 
know, I, I, it seemed like we did go home, uh, I can't

15:48.203 --> 16:00.002
even remember, I don't even think I went home 
Thanksgiving, I, it seemed like maybe, uh, I could

16:00.961 --> 16:04.747
not tell you where we played it at A&M or Austin. I 
don't remember. But I don't remember going home.

16:07.391 --> 16:12.598
The only time I remember going home was the one time 
when Snake Tommy got caught and then Christmas.

16:13.219 --> 16:14.281
And I didn't want to come back. You mean you were 
thinking about dropping us? Oh, yes, yes. I told my

16:19.048 --> 16:21.512
mother that I was not going back. And mother's 
response was, baby, you don't have to. What led you

16:26.038 --> 16:27.120
to come back then? He pointed out that old green 55 
Studebaker and told me to get in it. And he told me

16:35.008 --> 16:38.072
the way to A&M, and he said, you go, boy. And so I did, 
you know. And had it not been, I probably would have

16:41.635 --> 16:44.779
dropped out. But my daddy told me that with tears in 
his eyes. All right. Then by the end of that

16:47.782 --> 16:58.693
semester, had you yet developed anybody that you 
turned to for sound advice, courses, major?

16:59.973 --> 17:03.238
Charlie Ransdell, Mickey McGuire, anybody like 
that? No, I never saw a dean.

17:11.210 --> 17:12.572
Gosh, I hate to admit this. I never saw a dean in my 
undergraduate career. First dean I ever really

17:17.600 --> 17:23.508
sat down with was Fred Benson when I was in graduate 
school. And he was almost a new dean himself at the

17:23.528 --> 17:26.253
time. I never talked to one of the subdeans when I 
was in undergraduate school. I never got on

17:29.453 --> 17:31.576
probation or anything, but I had to. Well, who did 
you turn to to know what course to take?

17:37.564 --> 17:39.506
Oh, goodness, Haskell. We worked much closer back 
in those days with people like Austin Curley and

17:40.848 --> 17:48.719
some of those people over at the Counseling and 
Advising Center. It seemed like maybe most of the

17:49.299 --> 17:55.748
counseling and advising was done by those people 
on what courses to take rather than your academic

17:49.299 --> 17:55.748
department. I remember it that way. That may not be 
exactly correct, but that's the way I remember it.

18:01.924 --> 18:06.396
We sat down and there were some advisors. in civil 
engineering that helped us finally work out a

18:06.730 --> 18:16.164
degree plan to make sure that we were following a 
degree plan and, you know, had the prerequisites

18:06.730 --> 18:16.164
and what have you. By spring, you are a civil 
engineering major. In the spring, I am signing up

18:19.870 --> 18:25.919
as a civil engineering major. That's correct. And 
what did you think As you started looking at

18:28.567 --> 18:31.671
engineering, what did you think you were going to 
do? Were you going to be a real engineer or were you

18:32.051 --> 18:35.035
going to be an academic? I was going to be a real 
engineer at that time. And I did not change that

18:38.078 --> 18:40.942
until my senior year. I didn't really decide that I 
wanted to be an academic until I was a senior day in

18:41.542 --> 18:45.767
Hill. Were you and your buddies aware of any easy 
courses when you were an undergraduate? No, there

18:51.034 --> 18:52.195
were no such. There were no such. Even P.E. was 
absolutely. See, my first year, my fifth year, I

18:59.906 --> 19:04.633
couldn't swim very well. And Art Adamson was the 
swimming guru. They threw all of us in the old

19:08.059 --> 19:11.144
natatorium. What was the name of it? Whatever the 
name of the natatorium. Downs. Downs. Downs

19:15.952 --> 19:16.573
Natatorium. Downs Natatorium. And everybody had 
to jump in and swim from one end to the other. And if

19:20.873 --> 19:24.170
you couldn't swim from one end to the other, you had 
to take swimming and PE. So my first semester, I

19:24.230 --> 19:26.502
took swimming. And my second semester, I took an 
adaptive PE class, trying to build up some

19:27.545 --> 19:34.113
strength in the back and more heavy. But those 
courses were miserable. But no, there were no easy

19:37.237 --> 19:39.040
courses. Gosh, I had, you know, you were not an easy 
prof in history. I'm sorry. I don't know if you just

19:43.986 --> 19:47.991
come out of rice and you felt like you had to be that 
way. But I don't know. I don't remember any easy. I

19:50.254 --> 19:53.658
remember no easy classes at all at Texas A&M High 
School. Y'all didn't hear about any giveaways for

19:53.698 --> 19:55.941
athletes? No. No, absolutely not. The only 
courses that I knew of at that point where the

19:58.874 --> 20:03.238
grading was easy, was Dan Russell, Dr. Dan the 
grade point man over in Rural Sociology. There

20:07.431 --> 20:11.678
were a couple of courses where you could pass if you 
went to class. If you went to class. You might not

20:12.760 --> 20:13.801
get an A. And they weren't just for athletes, they 
were for anybody. No, we had a most difficult time.

20:19.450 --> 20:24.118
Not only as a freshman, all through my 
undergraduate career. In my junior and senior

20:25.019 --> 20:29.226
year, academically, it got real tough in 
engineering because there were a lot of the

20:29.611 --> 20:40.004
athlete students, Air Force Institute of 
Technology students, old Korean veterans, both

20:29.611 --> 20:40.004
Army and Air Force. It just flooded the campus. And 
I would say at least a third of my civil engineering

20:42.086 --> 20:46.311
class were Army and Air Force officers. And hey, 
man, they screwed the curve. And they were

20:49.355 --> 20:50.737
serious. Well, all they had to do was go to class and 
study and draw their pay. And my late junior,

20:55.632 --> 21:05.526
senior year success, quite honestly, was tied to 
three or four of those guys. Major Davis, Captain

21:05.546 --> 21:14.017
Eads, Captain Custer, Jack Custer from Rock 
Springs, Texas. I never will forget those guys.

21:16.761 --> 21:18.163
They let me study with them. And my grades went up 
tremendously. And then, of course, I married my

21:22.366 --> 21:26.857
senior year, and grades continued to go up. But 
now, the spring of your freshman year, you're

21:26.877 --> 21:34.335
getting more serious, more sure you're going to 
stay in school. Oh, yes. All right, then you go, at

21:35.778 --> 21:42.972
the end of that first year, that summer, is that 
when your father died? Yes. All right, and so

21:43.372 --> 21:49.704
you're back home, and you stay with family through 
the fall. Right. And then come back. Yes, I worked

21:51.488 --> 21:55.576
for the Texas Highway Department during that 
break. What did that do to you or that family?

21:58.880 --> 22:02.886
period out of school, what did that do to your 
determination about coming back to school? Go

22:02.906 --> 22:03.306
back. Go back. Boy, there's something out there 
for you. Working around those civil engineers at

22:07.071 --> 22:10.516
the highway department, go back. There's 
something out there for you. And I was very

22:12.739 --> 22:15.022
motivated to come back. So you come back the spring 
of what, of your second year? Yes. You weren't in

22:18.707 --> 22:20.390
the Corps that semester? No. Where did you live? 
Milder Hall. Was there any teasing about your

22:25.686 --> 22:27.991
being a day duck? Yeah, there was teasing about 
that, but I got through it, and then junior year

22:28.272 --> 22:36.150
went right back into the Corps. Then after your 
sophomore year, what did you do that summer? I

22:39.802 --> 22:42.485
worked for the highway department. Okay. And in 
that spring semester, I worked for TTI. Spring

22:46.591 --> 22:49.234
semester, my sophomore year, I worked for TTI. Was 
that a good maturing experience? Oh, absolutely,

22:51.277 --> 22:52.739
yes, yes. That led so much to what I eventually did, 
working for TTI and the state highway department.

22:59.748 --> 23:03.752
And you said you had gotten in the singing cadets. 
Describe that. What was that like? Oh, it was

23:06.495 --> 23:08.137
tremendous. I had wanted to do it as a freshman and 
just didn't feel like I could do it. Bob Boone was

23:13.442 --> 23:18.968
very new as the director of the singing cadets. How 
did he and others receive a new singing cadet?

23:24.942 --> 23:49.752
Well, being how I had already been on campus for a 
year or so, I didn't go through the typical buffoon

23:24.942 --> 23:49.752
type of situation that the other brand new 
freshman maybe had gone through, but I was a first

23:24.942 --> 23:49.752
tenor and Boone was so much in need of tenors that I 
think he would Taking anyone who could squeak. In

23:51.666 --> 23:53.089
fact, I was called Squeak. That was my name. And 
treated very, very fine. Describe the routine for

23:58.720 --> 24:00.644
y'all. Where did you practice and when? We 
practiced in the bottom floor of, I guess it was

24:02.227 --> 24:07.858
Dorm 4. Let me think, dorm two, dorm four, dorm 
three. I believe it was dorm four, bottom floor,

24:13.328 --> 24:16.690
one end. We had risers in an over-large room there, 
and that was the practice hall for the senior

24:17.151 --> 24:26.579
cadets every day, five days a week at five o'clock. 
Five to six? Uh-huh. Did that also get you out of

24:28.961 --> 24:33.385
some bull in the corps? See, I was civilian that 
first semester. I was actually a civilian that

24:35.727 --> 24:37.609
semester. And I don't know if you know it or not, but 
back in those days, there was kind of a compulsory

24:38.112 --> 24:50.713
corps, non-compulsory corps, and I don't 
remember exactly how that happened, but I was able

24:38.112 --> 24:50.713
to come in as a civilian that semester. Went back 
into the corps, first semester of my junior year.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.502
But yeah, even then, yeah, you were out of some 
bull. Was there, to get into the singing cadets,

24:56.582 --> 25:00.769
was there any kind of... Audition. Audition? Yes. 
And who... Bob Boone. Was it one-on-one? Yes, and

25:06.817 --> 25:09.982
it was real unusual, Haskell. I could not read 
music. I had no music in high school and didn't come

25:12.526 --> 25:22.942
from a musically inclined family, although my 
sisters were all beautiful singers, and my dad was

25:12.526 --> 25:22.942
not bad. My dad knew what a pitch pipe was, and we 
came from a... a religious practice, I'm Church

25:27.809 --> 25:33.135
Christ, non-instrumental music. And so Boone 
pulled out a few music pieces that I'd never seen

25:33.896 --> 25:42.365
before in my life and said, can you read music? And I 
said, no, I can't. And he says, well, what makes you

25:44.508 --> 25:47.511
think you can be a singing cadet? I said, well, I 
think I can sing. And he said, well, where have you

25:50.655 --> 25:54.159
sung before? I said, well, I sing in church. And he 
asked about piano accompaniment and what have

25:57.188 --> 26:01.359
you. And I said, no, you know, it's all a cappella in 
Church of Christ. So he says, OK. And he thumped

26:05.850 --> 26:08.938
through some music. And he finally finds a 
religious piece that you can sing a cappella. He

26:14.165 --> 26:15.407
said, well, let's do it. And I think the lady that 
was at the time the pianist for the group maybe hit

26:15.667 --> 26:27.583
the starting key for it. And I actually sang 
soprano lead on it, rather than a tenor part. And I

26:34.653 --> 26:41.202
told him, I said, I can tell you right now, I cannot 
start the tenor lead on that and sing the tenor on

26:41.182 --> 26:45.807
that song, and he said, well, I'll sing the soprano 
and you sing the tenor. And we did. And then he had

26:47.188 --> 27:01.223
the pianist play another piece, and Bob and I kind 
of played around on those, and I would pick up the

26:47.188 --> 27:01.223
tenor, and he said, yeah, I think you'll make a 
tenor for us. And I think he had four first tenors,

27:01.844 --> 27:07.750
and the group was either 50 or 60. I can't remember 
how many there were. I think maybe it was 50 in those

27:08.911 --> 27:10.733
days. And he only had four first tenors, and he 
said, I can really use a first tenor. So I probably

27:16.643 --> 27:26.094
was selected as a singing cadet more because Bob 
needed one other voice than I really had the

27:16.643 --> 27:26.094
capability. But I learned a little music in the 
process as I stayed in the cadets and thoroughly

27:26.114 --> 27:31.481
enjoyed it. I really did. Now, you stayed through? 
Yes, I stayed through the rest of my academic

27:33.002 --> 27:36.146
career. In general, the singing cadets in that era 
were made up of Describe the typical. About

27:45.109 --> 27:49.521
two-thirds corps, one-third civilian.

27:53.652 --> 27:57.342
Most of them just enjoyed singing. There were even 
a few athletes in the group, as a matter of fact.

28:02.012 --> 28:05.357
Could you generalize that they were all Baptist, 
Methodist, church crazed? No, I don't think so. I

28:06.639 --> 28:08.583
think it was a pretty good mixture. I know that when 
we went on spring tours, we typically paid visits

28:08.603 --> 28:19.701
to some of the big Methodist church and Baptist 
church in Houston and Fort Worth, Dallas and what

28:08.603 --> 28:19.701
have you. No, there was no particular group 
represented in the cadets. It was pretty diverse.

28:27.601 --> 28:31.491
And your spring tour lasted how long? A week, the 
biggest part of a week. And you did something

28:34.217 --> 28:37.285
afternoon and evening? Very common to do that, 
yeah, and then get on the bus and try to make it to the

28:37.720 --> 28:44.230
next place because, goodness, we'd go on a tour and 
we'd leave here. And we'd go to El Paso on buses. And

28:48.377 --> 28:56.329
we'd have concerts in Dallas, Fort Worth, 
Midland, Odessa, you know, El Paso, and then catch

28:48.377 --> 28:56.329
Waco on the way home or something. It was 
jam-packed. Any pranks or jokes? among the scene

29:00.113 --> 29:02.257
cadets on these trips? No, you know, I would have to 
say that the behavior and the overall demeanor of

29:03.159 --> 29:15.462
the scene cadets was a cut above, if you will, the 
behavior of everyone else in general. I mean,

29:15.502 --> 29:18.587
Boone didn't put up with a lot of nonsense. And see, 
we almost always were staying in the homes of

29:22.675 --> 29:31.252
either old former students or church leaders and 
what have you. We very seldom ever stayed in

29:31.692 --> 29:33.576
hotels. The only time we ever stayed in hotels 
were, for example, Miss Teenage American Pageant

29:33.596 --> 29:39.267
or something like that. All the rest of the time, we 
were staying in the home. I never will forget

29:41.611 --> 29:47.240
staying in the home of T.M. Smith. I don't know if 
you remember the T.M. Smith and T.L. Smith. They

29:52.989 --> 30:02.844
were big Aggies down in the West Columbia area, and 
I never will forget going to that part of the world.

30:02.944 --> 30:03.465
Now, they're not They're not the class of 99? 99 and 
01 or something like that. Really? Oh, yes. Yes, I

30:10.717 --> 30:12.882
stayed in Tim Smith's home. All right, the reason 
my vibes start is that they were among the ardent

30:12.902 --> 30:20.442
opponents. of co-education on compulsion. You 
got it. Alright, do you remember anything,

30:23.844 --> 30:27.047
hearing them talk about that? No, I remember Mr. 
Smith showing us some oil wells, which he had

30:27.508 --> 30:45.670
several of, but what I remember most, Haskell, and 
it was so strange for a boy from the farm up in

30:27.508 --> 30:45.670
northeast Texas going to his home, and he had a maid 
and a butler. And we were greeted at the front door

30:45.650 --> 30:52.221
by the butler. And when I got ready to clean up for 
the concert, the butler helped me to the bath. I

31:00.234 --> 31:05.943
mean, it was like, no, no, this is not really 
happening to Ned Walden, you know. That was quite

31:05.963 --> 31:07.666
an experience. And got ready to go. to the concert, 
and typically what would happen is that whoever

31:10.591 --> 31:17.827
your host was would drive you to the concert. Mr. 
Smith handed me the keys to a brand new Chrysler

31:18.950 --> 31:23.360
automobile. It seemed like I remember it having 
300 or 400 miles on it. And after the concert, we

31:27.415 --> 31:34.407
would go to parties that the local people would 
host. And there was a judge, and I could not tell you

31:34.447 --> 31:43.202
his name for anything, but this judge was hosting a 
party for the singing cadets. And after the

31:43.222 --> 31:45.205
concert...
