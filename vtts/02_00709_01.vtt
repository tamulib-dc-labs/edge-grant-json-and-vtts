WEBVTT

00:01.111 --> 00:06.197
research chemist and head of the Texas 
Engineering Experiment Station Food Protein

00:01.111 --> 00:06.197
Division. Today's date is August 4th, 1981. Let's 
begin, Dr. Lucis, by your telling us something

00:09.500 --> 00:14.646
about your early years, please. Well, I grew up on a 
farm in Woodbury, Connecticut, and it was a

00:16.188 --> 00:24.157
general purpose and dairy farm. And I first went to 
college to become a butter dairy farmer. And this

00:29.933 --> 00:33.717
was at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, 
Connecticut. Where? Storrs. Spell that.

00:36.760 --> 00:44.046
S-T-O-R-R-S. And while there, my interests 
turned to food processing. And my first degree,

00:44.907 --> 00:51.434
BS, was in dairy production as well as dairy 
manufacturing. When did you get this degree? This

00:52.635 --> 00:53.435
was in 1954. When did you finish house food? 1949. I 
spent a year in between dairy farming. I then went

01:03.803 --> 01:07.807
on to Iowa State College at the time. Before you go 
on, how far was this part of Connecticut from New

01:08.167 --> 01:12.472
York City? This was about 100 miles, and that was a 
long way. 100 miles east? Yeah, northeast. This

01:18.818 --> 01:26.586
was in the southern part of Litchfield County at 
the Berkshire foothills. So there are still

01:28.591 --> 01:31.915
agricultural and dairy interests in this part of 
Connecticut? Very little now. There probably

01:32.856 --> 01:36.521
aren't more than 100 or 150 farms left. And those 
are dairy farms. And there is a lot of truck

01:39.444 --> 01:45.832
gardening and also tobacco gardening. 
Shade-grown tobacco for

01:45.852 --> 01:54.042
cigar wrappings and binders is a very major 
industry. The profitability is such that they've

01:54.697 --> 01:59.283
been able to continue to use land for that.

02:02.266 --> 02:06.051
OK, you finished that degree in 1954, and then you 
went to Iowa State. Iowa State. At Ames. At Ames.

02:08.574 --> 02:09.315
Tell me about that. Well, the way I got there was 
that in my senior year at Connecticut, I was on a

02:10.937 --> 02:21.430
dairy products judging team. And we were pretty 
good. We took first place in the eastern states

02:23.751 --> 02:35.047
dairy products judging meet in Springfield, 
Massachusetts, and then went on to the national

02:23.751 --> 02:35.047
meeting, which was held at Boston that year. And 
there was a fellowship given to members of each of

02:36.288 --> 02:45.361
the top three teams. And that was my ticket to Iowa 
State.

02:50.705 --> 02:56.531
I studied in the dairy manufacturing building, as 
they call it there. Actually, my degree was in food

02:57.552 --> 03:00.595
technology. At that time, no one quite knew what a 
food technologist was. But they were starting to

03:06.420 --> 03:10.845
identify that as a separate discipline.

03:14.108 --> 03:17.151
I was there for just about a year. finished my 
masters and then went to the University of

03:17.350 --> 03:23.316
Wisconsin at Madison. There I did my PhD in food 
technology, working primarily on canned

03:24.217 --> 03:36.148
vegetable and canned fruit problems. I finished 
that degree in 1958. It also was in food

03:39.751 --> 03:42.854
technology.

03:45.377 --> 03:46.598
After that, I went to Work for the Quaker Oats 
Company at the John Stewart Research

03:46.915 --> 03:53.302
Laboratories in Barrington, Illinois. Spell 
that. Barrington, B-A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N.

03:55.464 --> 04:07.558
And Quaker, of course, everybody recognizes the 
little Quaker man in the oatmeal box. But it was a

04:08.299 --> 04:10.341
diversified company. It had many, many product 
lines. It was the largest miller of not only oats,

04:14.945 --> 04:28.199
but also of barley and dry corn products, such as 
white corn grits, yellow corn meal. They

04:30.601 --> 04:43.635
developed a process for making masa harina, 
M-A-S-A, harina, H-A-R-I-N-A, which is the lime

04:43.835 --> 04:48.262
treated corn that tortillas are made from. This 
was really the first convenience type of Mexican

04:48.302 --> 05:00.541
food that had been developed, and so the company 
had many interests. I was in the food, in the bakery

05:00.561 --> 05:11.378
mixes group for the first three years, and because 
I had had considerable experience and exposure to

05:12.488 --> 05:15.272
canning. When I worked on canned fruits and 
vegetables in my PhD, I then transferred over to

05:16.254 --> 05:21.783
work on pet foods. At that time, the U.S. pet foods 
industry was probably about $800 million a year

05:23.065 --> 05:36.066
volume, and Quaker had... about $60 million of the 
sales. It was the largest seller of pet foods.

05:45.004 --> 05:48.949
There were very, very many small companies in the 
area. Those were very exciting years because it

05:51.172 --> 05:56.019
was a chance to pull many things together. One of 
the things that I did was organize the research

05:57.420 --> 06:04.129
program at Quaker Oats I started with a staff of 
two, and 12 years later had a staff of 32 people. We

06:15.541 --> 06:33.407
developed numerous products, expanded

06:15.541 --> 06:33.407
the U.S. product line from five products to about 
30 in that period, developed processes that

06:15.541 --> 06:33.407
allowed the company to enter other markets put up 
plants in Holland,

06:33.809 --> 06:48.909
England, Australia, and also expand the line, the 
cattle ration and Puss in Boots lines in Canada.

06:51.492 --> 07:02.567
During that 12-year period, the sales of pet foods 
rose from about $60 million to close to $280

06:51.492 --> 07:02.567
million. Uh, so it was very exciting period. Uh, 
this was still at Barrington, Illinois, still at

07:08.972 --> 07:14.181
Barrington, Illinois. Um, the pet foods industry 
was growing about twice as fast or nearly three

07:16.104 --> 07:24.918
times as fast as, uh, as grocery products 
industry. And there was the, uh, uh, leader in

07:31.150 --> 07:48.549
development of new types of, and application of 
new types of technologies such as continuous

07:31.150 --> 07:48.549
retorts, development of semi-moist pet foods 
which are preserved by controlling the water

07:31.150 --> 07:48.549
activity.

07:51.512 --> 08:01.022
In other words, by use of high osmotic pressure, 
this means sugar, salt, and as well as pH control.

08:03.498 --> 08:10.407
Since then, quite a few products have been 
developed and marketed, but we were pioneers at

08:03.498 --> 08:10.407
the time. What was the reason for this boom in pet 
food during this period? Well, there were several

08:16.435 --> 08:18.458
reasons. The world was going through a rather 
affluent stage. Much

08:25.708 --> 08:30.975
of Europe had been rebuilt. After the war, 
business conditions were pretty good, and there

08:31.242 --> 08:46.703
were something like about 25 million dogs at the 
time in the U.S., and about the same number of cats,

08:31.242 --> 08:46.703
probably about 22 million cats. And people were 
becoming conscious about their pets, and they

08:47.705 --> 08:59.781
were starting to treat them as... well, as 
surrogate children. In some cases, even taking

09:04.040 --> 09:07.705
better care of them than with their own kids. Of 
course, when you are working with pet food, you are

09:09.827 --> 09:26.669
in an area of food technology, which is a cross 
between, say, human food science and animal

09:09.827 --> 09:26.669
feeding science. You're

09:32.313 --> 09:35.297
products are sold in grocery stores.

09:37.981 --> 09:45.592
And therefore, they have to be attractive and 
pleasant in appearance and in odor when they're

09:37.981 --> 09:45.592
brought into the household. On the other hand, in 
the 50 states, the regulations and requirements

09:46.113 --> 09:58.290
are set by the respective state feed control 
officials. So when you are working on pet foods,

10:02.367 --> 10:13.622
You have to abide by these various state laws as 
well as also take full responsibility for the

10:02.367 --> 10:13.622
nutrition of the animal. This is one thing that we 
aren't yet doing in food. We give people free

10:19.050 --> 10:31.547
choice, but when you have a pet and it relies 
entirely on you for its sustenance, someone has to

10:19.050 --> 10:31.547
worry about its nutrition.

10:32.084 --> 10:46.707
Pets do go through a life cycle, and there are 
different nutrition needs from, say, puppyhood

10:32.084 --> 10:46.707
through growth, reproduction, and then on into 
the older ages.

10:50.292 --> 10:57.163
You do get a very good overview of nutrition in 
application when you work in the pet food area. You

10:57.464 --> 11:01.590
worked in that from 58 to 70? From 58 to about 1971. 
At that time, I

11:04.675 --> 11:16.112
had been, no, let's see, I worked in pet foods from 
61 to about 71.

11:17.474 --> 11:24.585
At that time, I,

11:17.474 --> 11:24.585
let me shut that off. Well, I don't want to

11:24.903 --> 11:38.437
answer that. You can just wait. You said you worked 
in the Pet Food Division from 61 to 71. Right. At

11:45.844 --> 11:49.948
that time, I became interested in other areas. And 
I found that the world really wasn't giving or

11:54.974 --> 12:00.422
recognizing the pet food technologists as being 
part of the food science area. And by this time, I

12:01.965 --> 12:16.206
had amassed quite a large staff and realized that 
after

12:01.965 --> 12:16.206
this, most of my future would be in management and 
administration. So I took a two-year course in the

12:17.007 --> 12:24.238
Graduate School of Business at the University of 
Chicago. in their executive program. This was a

12:27.358 --> 12:34.007
fixed curriculum program, which led to an MBA in 
two years. And

12:35.369 --> 12:51.812
it was a type of course where you still

12:35.369 --> 12:51.812
continued your job full time.

12:52.535 --> 13:06.036
One week went to two classes, all day classes on 
Friday on the company's time and next week went all

12:52.535 --> 13:06.036
day Saturday on your own time. There were two 
sessions or two groups that went simultaneously

13:07.659 --> 13:15.131
through the program and they would alternate 
Fridays and Saturdays. It took about 30 hours a

13:17.074 --> 13:19.858
week. to take the course on top of your regular 
program. So it was just like signing up for law

13:24.967 --> 13:28.913
school, things like that.

13:33.339 --> 13:36.043
This is 1970.

13:38.145 --> 13:46.437
I completed the Master's of Business 
Administration in 1972.

13:48.593 --> 13:58.046
In 1971,

13:48.593 --> 13:58.046
the company divisionalized.

14:00.649 --> 14:14.989
The sales of the company had grown from something 
like about $90 million a year to well over a billion

14:00.649 --> 14:14.989
and a half.

14:16.420 --> 14:36.530
in the previous 15 years, and there were many new 
groups organized, and I took on the position of

14:16.420 --> 14:36.530
Manager of Scientific Services. This was running 
the services in common for the various research

14:39.826 --> 14:46.756
programs at the Barrington Laboratories.

14:49.720 --> 15:06.402
I had 65 people at the time, and we ran the 
analytical laboratory, microbiology,

14:49.720 --> 15:06.402
biochemistry research,

14:49.720 --> 15:06.402
statistics, operations research, and data 
processing. These were programs that served not

15:09.374 --> 15:18.364
only the people in the research laboratories, but 
also at the various plants as the need arose. I held

15:20.226 --> 15:32.359
that position until 1977, at which time I came to 
Texas A&M University. What was the circumstances

15:32.839 --> 15:34.521
of your coming here?

15:39.091 --> 15:56.768
The Food Protein Research and Development Center 
had lost its associate director, Dr. Carl Kater,

15:39.091 --> 15:56.768
C-A-T-E-R, the previous October. It's Carl with a 
C or a K. C-A-R-L.

16:03.455 --> 16:04.596
I believe it was in October. I'm sorry, it was the 
previous November. in an airplane accident. He

16:09.153 --> 16:18.705
was flying his private plane to a meeting in 
Peoria, Illinois, and had an accident. The

16:19.546 --> 16:37.026
position was open, and so I came on board as an 
associate director of research, realizing at the

16:19.546 --> 16:37.026
time that this was a training position for 
becoming director since the then director, Dr.

16:37.529 --> 16:55.249
Carl Mattil, that's K-A-R-L, Mattil, 
M-A-T-T-I-L,

16:37.529 --> 16:55.249
had had a heart attack several years earlier and 
was working part time.

16:58.252 --> 17:03.638
He didn't look very good at the time of the 
interview. Um, and, uh, but I still thought he

17:04.512 --> 17:11.700
probably would, um, uh, would be active for 
another year or two. Uh, however, when I got here,

17:13.101 --> 17:30.300
um, he had, had become quite disabled and, uh, uh, 
went in the hospital shortly thereafter and died,

17:13.101 --> 17:30.300
uh, not from a heart attack, but from, um, 
pancreatic cancer, which is a very painful way to

17:13.101 --> 17:30.300
go. I really spent very little time with Dr. Mattil 
because of the circumstances. And so

17:38.168 --> 17:44.078
essentially, here I was having two positions to 
fill. And I had just arrived from industry.

17:50.709 --> 17:55.798
Carl Mattil died in October of 1977.

17:57.247 --> 18:04.418
There were plans at the time on the drawing board 
for developing or building a new building.

18:05.220 --> 18:13.092
Actually, it was a program to move the Food Protein 
Research and Development Center out of Central

18:05.220 --> 18:13.092
Campus.

18:16.478 --> 18:24.891
The original building had been donated to the 
university by the Texas Cotton Seed Processors

18:25.428 --> 18:32.680
Committee back in the mid-1940s. And

18:33.621 --> 18:47.383
it had a solvent extraction plant along with it, 
and this was right next to the boiler house or the

18:33.621 --> 18:47.383
boiler plant in Central Campus. Of course, as the 
university had grown, it had had to expand its

18:52.900 --> 19:04.294
utilities, including the steam generation and 
water chilling facilities, and it badly needed

18:52.900 --> 19:04.294
that space to expand the central power plant. Our 
building was fairly old and inadequate at the

19:05.696 --> 19:12.845
time, and so an exchange was made. They built new 
buildings for us, the research oil mill out at the

19:21.200 --> 19:26.907
Texas A&M Research Annex at West Highway 21 in 
Bryan. That's the site of the former Bryan Air

19:28.369 --> 19:30.872
Force Base. And the new Food Protein Research and 
Development main building was built in West

19:32.254 --> 19:50.937
Campus, just west of the railroad tracks, beyond 
Wellborn Road and the south of University Avenue,

19:51.980 --> 19:56.907
just south of the agricultural engineering 
shops. Um, as I was mentioning earlier, the plans

19:59.110 --> 20:07.541
were there, but, uh, but they weren't finalized. 
And so one of my first duties was to, uh, finalize

20:07.621 --> 20:17.215
the, uh, list of requirements. And, um, and then 
work with the architect in designing the

20:20.245 --> 20:23.551
building. Of course, making various compromises 
since everyone's operating under a budget.

20:32.306 --> 20:40.820
We moved first into the research oil mill in the 
summer of 1979.

20:43.705 --> 20:45.308
We had shut down some of the research program, 
particularly the salmon extraction plant. I

20:51.493 --> 21:13.168
moved that in the summer of 1979, and then

20:51.493 --> 21:13.168
moved the rest of the

20:51.493 --> 21:13.168
equipment out in the summer of 1980, as well as 
moving some equipment to the new Food Protein

20:51.493 --> 21:13.168
Research and Development Center building. and 
the laboratories. At that time, the center

21:16.887 --> 21:25.680
operated

21:16.887 --> 21:25.680
in four locations. I had moved the main office to 
the Oilseed

21:27.703 --> 21:41.805
Products Building, which was at the corner of 
Ireland and Ross. Ireland and Ross Streets. The

21:47.378 --> 21:53.504
main, let's see, the newer laboratories were in 
the O&ET building. Dr. K.C. Rhee, that's K-H-E-E,

21:57.047 --> 22:11.860
Choon, C-H-O-O-N, Rhee, capital R-H-E-E, had 
laboratories in the agronomy field laboratory.

22:12.667 --> 22:14.569
near the veterinary school. And we also had a fish 
protein concentrate plant at the Texas A&M

22:15.430 --> 22:22.198
Research Annex. Through our moving, we 
consolidated the facilities into two locations,

22:24.721 --> 22:42.302
the research oil mill at the Texas A&M Research 
Extension Center and the main building on campus.

22:43.413 --> 22:48.840
What was the cost of this building? The total 
building program was about $3.2 million. This was

22:53.146 --> 22:57.511
more than we had anticipated. Approximately 
$400,000

22:58.933 --> 23:11.850
was spent on the two Butler-type buildings at the a 
research oil mill. There's about 12,000 square

23:15.306 --> 23:35.413
feet there, about 1,500 in the solvent extraction 
plant,

23:15.306 --> 23:35.413
and 10,500 in the seed

23:15.306 --> 23:35.413
cleaning and processing building. The main 
building on campus

23:40.855 --> 23:58.298
has 28,000 square feet, and it costs about $2.6

23:40.855 --> 23:58.298
million. Funds for these facilities came from the 
university permanent fund, and another $200,000

24:11.568 --> 24:20.822
approximately was contributed by the Texas 
Engineering Experiment Station from their

24:11.568 --> 24:20.822
operating budget. This was for moving costs, 
certain components which we needed because we now

24:20.842 --> 24:39.651
had split our power plant in two locations.

24:41.335 --> 24:49.609
We did most of the finishing

24:41.335 --> 24:49.609
of the research formula ourselves. This included 
painting, putting in benches, actually

24:49.629 --> 25:06.178
refinishing benches, putting in tile floors, of 
course, dismantling the old equipment, moving

24:49.629 --> 25:06.178
it. building steel platforms. In many cases, we 
had to remodel the equipment as we reinstall it.

25:18.909 --> 25:20.912
Industry was quite helpful. To this point, we've 
received about $650,000 worth of equipment and

25:23.055 --> 25:35.153
services as either straight donations or long 
term loans of equipment. which is the same as the

25:35.707 --> 25:38.890
donations as we see it.

25:42.014 --> 25:51.924
In total, I would say we currently have a 
replacement value of about $6.5 million for our

25:42.014 --> 25:51.924
facilities.

25:55.888 --> 26:05.038
We held a industry open house and dedication 
program on the 14th and 15th of April, 1981, to

26:05.558 --> 26:20.794
commemorate

26:05.558 --> 26:20.794
the establishment of these new facilities. And at 
that time, through the action of the Board of

26:21.935 --> 26:34.047
Regents, the main building was named Cater Matil 
Hall in honor of Dr. Carl Mattel and Carl Cater, who

26:34.634 --> 26:39.498
were the founders of the Food Protein Research and 
Development Center. How many researchers do you

26:41.880 --> 26:44.342
have working here?

26:50.487 --> 26:54.751
We have 10 principal investigators. These are 
people who lead programs.

26:59.775 --> 27:04.219
In most cases, they are PhDs. I'd say only two of 
them are not. And then they have other advanced

27:08.850 --> 27:12.093
degree people working for them. So we have a total 
of about 15 advanced degree people in the program.

27:20.441 --> 27:22.262
These researchers, some of these also teach? Or 
these are strictly research people? They teach,

27:26.886 --> 27:33.092
but the center is a full-time research program. 
We're not an academic group in that we give courses

27:33.393 --> 27:40.721
as such or can give degrees. Our people have 
cross-appointments in other departments. Well,

27:47.489 --> 27:53.336
soil and crop sciences is probably the major one. 
Dr. Ki-Chun Ri, who is now my associate director of

27:54.698 --> 28:00.244
research, has several appointments. He has an 
appointment to the graduate school through them

28:04.722 --> 28:12.231
and can lead graduate students. He also is a 
lecturer, presents two courses under Sonic Crop

28:12.331 --> 28:24.245
Sciences. Dr. Larry Johnson presents a course a 
year and is also appointed through the graduate

28:30.262 --> 28:33.365
school.

28:36.369 --> 28:44.257
I'm also a professor in soil and crop sciences and 
have an appointment in the graduate school. Then

28:46.159 --> 28:57.552
we have two people who have cross-appointments in 
agricultural engineering, Dr. Jose Aguilera.

28:59.405 --> 29:04.290
who teaches a course in food packaging. Did you 
spell that last? Aguilera, A-G-U-I-L-E-R-A.

29:09.976 --> 29:15.482
And he leads graduate students. And the other 
person is Dr. Katie Engler. That's C-A-D-Y

29:21.728 --> 29:28.956
Engler, E-N-G-L-E-R. Katie is half-time 
graduate. on our program as a half-time teaching

29:29.695 --> 29:34.980
appointment in agricultural engineering. I 
believe he teaches through a year, probably three

29:36.442 --> 29:43.609
different courses, and also leads several 
graduate students. Currently, we have about 42

29:44.570 --> 29:50.236
people, nine of whom are associated with the 
program here. Nine of them are graduate students.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.741
In many cases, they are They are here on their own 
money rather than on half-time assistantships.

30:01.252 --> 30:06.918
We have three visiting scientists, one from 
Argentina, two from Korea. And then, of course, we

30:09.460 --> 30:24.255
have our secretarial and

30:09.460 --> 30:24.255
hourly people that make up the difference So that 
40, what was that? It's about 42 staff members plus

30:27.472 --> 30:34.920
the three visiting scientists. So 45 would be a 
better number.

30:39.285 --> 30:39.846
All right. What are some of the research projects 
that have recently been completed in food

30:39.866 --> 30:43.750
protein?

30:47.354 --> 30:52.740
The one that probably brought the most attention 
The most international attention to the center

30:53.598 --> 31:09.897
was the development of a process for extracting 
protein from coconuts and making protein liquid

30:53.598 --> 31:09.897
and dry milk products for the Philippine 
government. This was a project that was initiated

31:09.917 --> 31:18.947
after Dr. Matil toured the world for the AID 
program. in the agency for international

31:19.940 --> 31:24.085
development. The project was started in the early 
70s. It took about three or four years to complete.

31:32.655 --> 31:48.293
And we then sent one of our staff members to the 
Philippines for a two-year period to teach the

31:32.655 --> 31:48.293
local people, well, to oversee construction of a 
pilot plant and to train local staff. The question

31:49.032 --> 31:54.437
is, how do you work with coconuts at college 
station? It was simple. They just would fly them in

31:54.978 --> 32:01.884
by plane from the Caribbean

31:54.978 --> 32:01.884
several times a month. Coconuts are fairly 
stable, and you can keep them refrigerated. Dr.

32:05.328 --> 32:18.280
Hagenmeyer, Hagen, H-A-G-E-N-M-E-I-R,

32:05.328 --> 32:18.280
then stayed on with the Philippine Coconut 
Authority.

32:19.171 --> 32:22.155
has since become a permanent member of their 
staff. The Philippine government has decided to

32:22.695 --> 32:33.608
build a production plant that faces his early and 
later process development work. Here at

32:34.610 --> 32:44.141
the center, we're working on a number of 
interesting projects. We have taken the lead in

32:45.142 --> 32:49.127
the development processes and food uses for clam 
is cottonseed. Normally cottonseed has or

32:55.505 --> 33:02.754
contains

32:55.505 --> 33:02.754
Gossypol pigment. Gossypol, G-O-S-S-Y-P-O-L.

33:04.215 --> 33:11.824
Pigment which is laid down in small structures 
called glands. This is throughout the plant and

33:12.565 --> 33:17.751
also in the seed. And

33:23.093 --> 33:28.419
The gossip ball is toxic to all monogastric 
animals. Cattle can handle it well, but chickens,

33:29.821 --> 33:39.233
swine, horses, and humans, of course, cannot. It 
is possible to detoxify the gossip ball by high

33:40.574 --> 33:51.868
temperature heating, but this binds it to the 
lysine and really diminishes the food value of the

33:52.928 --> 33:55.151
seed. A new variety of cotton seed was discovered 
twenty years ago, and its development has

33:56.433 --> 34:09.391
continued. Basically, it's a genetically 
glandless variety. The seed just doesn't have the

34:16.401 --> 34:19.425
gland either the glands or the pigments. And as 
such, you now have a source of food protein, which

34:23.297 --> 34:41.819
is light-colored, very bland, much bland than 
soybeans, and can be used as a food source. This

34:42.039 --> 34:49.648
should be of particular interest in the world's 
developing countries because for the most part,

34:51.383 --> 35:04.819
The

34:51.383 --> 35:04.819
cultivation of soybeans is limited in the 
equatorial countries, which tend to be your

34:51.383 --> 35:04.819
famine-built countries. However, cotton is 
grown in these locations, and it could be a, well,

35:06.040 --> 35:19.095
the use of the seed as food would present a, another 
crop or return for the same agricultural effort

35:19.531 --> 35:26.100
for the same tillage and the same costs of 
production. The protein quality of glandless

35:27.843 --> 35:33.310
cottonseed is very good. It's as good or better 
than soybeans, which would make it probably the

35:33.370 --> 35:44.386
world's second best food protein source after 
rapeseed. However, rapeseed is a northern-grown

35:45.087 --> 35:48.171
crop. and there still are problems on detoxifying 
for food use. So I would say Glynis cottonseed,

35:55.221 --> 36:04.236
practically speaking, is a very excellent 
resource for developing countries.

36:06.920 --> 36:13.551
We have developed techniques for complete 
de-hulling and separating of Glynis cottonseed.

36:14.172 --> 36:32.654
uh, for roasting the seed, uh, to be used as nut 
replacements, uh, for making, uh, uh, defatted

36:14.172 --> 36:32.654
flowers, protein concentrates, and isolates, 
and isolates, I-S-O-L-A-T-E-S. Uh, these are,

36:33.535 --> 36:37.159
uh, different degrees of purity of protein. 
Normally with most cotton seeds, if you, well,

36:37.179 --> 36:43.386
with most seeds, once you get the hull off and the 
oil out, Uh, the residue will analyze about 50%

36:44.092 --> 36:48.978
protein. You would take about 5%. Um,

36:50.040 --> 36:56.528
if you then, this would be a flower. Uh, if you then 
were to wash the sugars, uh, out of the seed or out of

36:57.890 --> 37:12.529
say ground seed, uh, you would raise the protein 
count to about 70% and this would be the

36:57.890 --> 37:12.529
concentrate. If you then were to further purify 
the protein, such as by solubilizing in alkali and

37:13.387 --> 37:30.753
then re-precipitating with acid, you would have a 
isolate,

37:13.387 --> 37:30.753
which would be about 90% protein. These are the 
traditional ways of making various types of food

37:31.454 --> 37:37.063
proteins. We have gone beyond this. by 
fractionating the isolates into three

37:41.062 --> 37:46.107
fractions. The whey proteins, the storage and 
non-storage proteins, and each fraction has a

37:47.128 --> 38:02.484
different characteristic, in some cases a 
somewhat different nutritional value. The

38:03.405 --> 38:08.250
whey proteins are are very high quality 
nutrition-wise and are very similar to the whey

38:08.669 --> 38:20.960
proteins of milk, for example, or say the whey that 
results from making cheese. They would be

38:23.182 --> 38:38.575
nutritionally probably the equivalent of egg 
protein, which is considered to be the highest

38:23.182 --> 38:38.575
quality protein readily available for people.

38:39.432 --> 38:44.877
Cotton seed has, in the storage protein, has a 
fraction that is acid soluble. In other words, you

38:45.778 --> 38:57.369
could make fortified orange

38:45.778 --> 38:57.369
juices, soda pop type products, things of this 
nature. So there's a lot of versatility. But what

39:00.232 --> 39:06.958
we have done with

39:00.232 --> 39:06.958
cotton seed, we have done with most of the other 
oilseeds. This includes soybeans,

39:11.115 --> 39:19.567
peanuts, sunflower. In fact, in sunflower we have 
learned how to

39:19.588 --> 39:37.013
keep the chlorogenic acid, which is one of the 
compounds or components from turning green

39:19.588 --> 39:37.013
during the preparation of isolates. As a result, 
you have a white isolate that can be used in many

39:37.803 --> 39:41.887
food products. Dr. Aguilera has worked on 
processing and utilization of lupin. This is

39:50.634 --> 39:53.777
because of his earlier interest. He's a native 
Chilean who has received his last two degrees at US

39:54.778 --> 40:00.964
universities. And lupin is used as a food product 
in the L-U-P-I-N-A. It is used as a food source in

40:07.621 --> 40:14.492
Chile, and its interest is increasing in other 
countries. What is the state that it comes in?

40:16.855 --> 40:17.716
Well, it's a seed. It's something like a flat pea, 
and there are various types. The traditional

40:26.570 --> 40:36.345
types do have,

40:26.570 --> 40:36.345
well, they have better components, 
thioglycosinolates, which are, which are toxic

40:36.697 --> 40:42.566
and normally have to be soaked or leached out 
before processing. However, there are newer

40:42.606 --> 40:54.144
varieties, which are called the sweet-type 
lupins, where

40:42.606 --> 40:54.144
these components have been bred out of the plant. 
This

40:55.606 --> 41:02.637
results in a really useful food ingredient. We're 
pioneering other areas at the center. One of the

41:06.898 --> 41:21.236
processes has been this extraction process 
originally developed for the production of food

41:06.898 --> 41:21.236
protein from coconuts. In the wet coconut meat, 
protein is present only at about the 4% level, and

41:21.357 --> 41:31.510
there is a lot of fiber. that

41:32.485 --> 41:38.872
occurs with the protein. The problem there is how 
to extract this dilute amount of protein and

41:39.212 --> 41:44.638
concentrate it. A wet or aqueous extraction 
process was developed. This process primarily

41:49.262 --> 42:02.256
uses dairy type centrifuges for separating the 
oil from the protein, as well as various sieves and

42:03.097 --> 42:05.240
and decanters in the watering devices. Finally, 
you end up with a concentrated protein solution,

42:06.302 --> 42:15.737
which is dried on a spray dryer. This process has 
since been adapted to other oil seeds, such as

42:17.499 --> 42:27.535
soybeans, peanuts, sesame, and other products. 
And it shows considerable promise for the future

42:28.190 --> 42:36.942
because it is a way of extracting oil without using 
solvents. Most of the, well, I'd say all of the U.S.

42:36.962 --> 42:47.797
soy beans that are processed are extracted with 
hexane. And much of the other oil seeds are also

42:49.499 --> 42:53.906
similarly processed. Well, hexane is made from, 
Petroleum hexane, H-E-X-A-N-E. It's derived

43:00.971 --> 43:07.338
from the cracking of petroleum.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.203
It's become expensive. It costs probably about 
$1.60 to $2 a gallon, depending upon the volume

43:14.325 --> 43:20.152
that you buy it in. It's scarce, and it's more 
flammable or more combustible than gasoline. So

43:26.594 --> 43:29.899
one has to be very careful when you're going to sell 
an extraction plant. There also has been concerns

43:30.440 --> 43:43.501
about the residual petroleum, about petroleum 
residues in food products such as hexane

43:30.440 --> 43:43.501
extracted food flowers. All these problems are 
solved when you use aqueous extraction

43:43.842 --> 43:49.311
processing. The center also has pioneered in the 
application of industrial membranes. This is

43:59.774 --> 44:09.646
reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration to 
processing of proteins and other agricultural

43:59.774 --> 44:09.646
extractives.

44:12.930 --> 44:24.445
The ultrafiltration membranes are used to 
separate or sieve out, if you want to say proteins

44:24.796 --> 44:41.596
from the other soluble and the reverse osmosis is 
used to remove the water from the sugars and

44:24.796 --> 44:41.596
soluble salts and things of that nature. Through 
this technique, you not only recover, through a

44:42.777 --> 44:51.107
combination of these techniques, you not only 
recover more soluble protein, but you also can get

44:51.509 --> 44:54.913
75% of your water back for recycling. In other 
words, for reuse in the next batch process.

45:01.279 --> 45:19.558
Originally, the center got into the program

45:01.279 --> 45:19.558
to apply industrial membranes as pollution 
control devices, but later found that these

45:01.279 --> 45:19.558
techniques were useful. uh processing 
technologies and from there we from there on we

45:20.450 --> 45:49.663
went on to develop processes specifically using 
membranes we currently are working on processes

45:20.450 --> 45:49.663
using stage membranes in other words these 
membranes being for practical purposes sieves

45:20.450 --> 45:49.663
can be staged in series or you know call them 
stacked so that you do so you can't take separate

45:49.930 --> 45:52.133
proteins into fractions. Most oilseeds have four 
or more fractions of proteins, and we feel that we

45:52.513 --> 46:16.005
can separate these fractions commercially and at 
low cost, and therefore would have new type of food

45:52.513 --> 46:16.005
ingredients available to us.

46:18.196 --> 46:26.044
In the processing of agricultural crops,

46:18.196 --> 46:26.044
there really are two industries.

46:29.248 --> 46:46.026
The first is the industry that breaks the crops or 
extracts it, mills it into the ingredient, and

46:29.248 --> 46:46.026
then the grocery products industry, or say the 
institutional products industry, which then

46:46.343 --> 46:53.531
compounds these into products that appear on the 
grocery shelf or are shipped to McDonald's as

46:46.343 --> 46:53.531
ready mixes or to bakeries. We have taken the 
position that we'll work on the earlier phases

46:54.893 --> 47:09.550
that of developing new ingredients from 
agricultural crops rather than compete with the

46:54.893 --> 47:09.550
food.
