00:01.482 --> 00:10.172
The 101st

00:01.482 --> 00:10.172
Airborne, 173rd Light Infantry had a battalion 
there. All these were organized into a group

00:10.993 --> 00:13.576
called Task Force South. One of the outfits that 
was there was Charlie Company 75th Rangers, and

00:14.677 --> 00:28.013
they formed what were called long-range 
reconnaissance patrols, six-man teams that

00:14.677 --> 00:28.013
would go out into the jungle, in the valley, in the 
mountain areas. and look for the enemy. And by this

00:30.621 --> 00:45.180
time, about six months into my tour, the North 
Vietnamese were starting to come into the

00:30.621 --> 00:45.180
province, and they'd go out and try and find them, 
and then call in support to kill them. And so my job

00:45.200 --> 00:50.287
was to help put them into the jungle. I'd fly up and 
guide the helicopters into various landing

00:50.587 --> 00:56.295
zones, LZs, We'd know in advance where we were 
going to let them out. But then we'd have them go

01:00.495 --> 01:10.470
into a couple before and a couple after so the enemy 
wouldn't know where we let them out, hopefully. I

01:10.690 --> 01:12.392
flew in support of them while they were out there. 
If they got scared or had radio contact, I flew at

01:12.433 --> 01:16.098
night in support of them. We always had an alert 
pilot at night. And some of my more interesting

01:19.002 --> 01:22.487
things happened at night. And then we'd help pick 
them up. We had some pretty exciting times picking

01:26.853 --> 01:29.516
them up as well. So I had a very mission load, and it 
made it really, really interesting. And to use the

01:35.804 --> 01:41.611
word fun sounds inappropriate, but it really was. 
It was exciting, and I felt that I did a valuable

01:41.811 --> 01:45.896
job. I felt that I did it very well. And my main 
mission was bailing Americans out of trouble. I

01:53.145 --> 01:54.767
will tell you this is one key thing. When you had a 
contact, which is what we called countering the

01:56.097 --> 02:05.190
enemy, you had more people wanting to get on the 
action than you could handle. When you had an

02:05.210 --> 02:11.119
American in trouble, you had an unbelievable 
number of people wanting to help out. Americans

02:12.201 --> 02:18.911
looked out for each other.

02:18.931 --> 02:19.031
Good. Do you feel that there was any, this is kind of 
like wading into that again, Do you feel that there

02:24.397 --> 02:30.105
was any racial discrimination and or racial 
tension, if so? Not where I was. I know it existed

02:31.327 --> 02:33.811
other places, but not where I was. There was none 
where I was. That just didn't matter? It just

02:37.256 --> 02:38.017
didn't happen. The guys who were in the rear areas 
had time on their hands, and they're normally the

02:39.780 --> 02:51.737
ones who did most of the drugs and... had the racial 
problems that happened in some of the infantry

02:52.257 --> 03:00.704
units too, but usually guys that have to depend on 
each other, depended on each other and became very

02:52.257 --> 03:00.704
good friends. Was there any kind of initiation 
process? You talked about that there are some

03:06.610 --> 03:08.231
veterans. Did you feel odd at times because you 
were the new kid? Not really. The one guy who tried

03:15.037 --> 03:20.442
to act like he was the veteran and the big combat 
hero was really sort of a jerk. and I figured him out

03:20.793 --> 03:27.619
pretty fast, so most of the veterans were very 
helpful. Did you dislike the local people other

03:27.639 --> 03:34.084
than the enemy that you came in contact with? How 
did they feel about you in the United States? We had

03:37.087 --> 03:41.130
Vietnamese observers, and one of our missions was 
to fly with the Vietnamese in the back seat. And

03:42.031 --> 03:47.015
these guys were pretty good guys. A couple of them 
were local. He lived in Phan Thiet. A couple of them

03:50.493 --> 03:52.977
were what we called Chu Hoys. They're North 
Vietnamese who surrendered, or Chu Hoid. Chu Hoi

03:57.363 --> 03:59.727
means I surrender.

04:02.411 --> 04:05.075
And they flew in the back. We got along real well 
with them. Over the course of the year, I lost a

04:08.099 --> 04:20.297
great deal of respect for the Vietnamese as a whole 
because they'd

04:08.099 --> 04:20.297
been fighting for a lot of years, and they were 
tired. But the communists have been fighting for a

04:21.205 --> 04:23.167
lot of years too. And a lot of the South Vietnamese 
were giving up, were corrupt, weren't giving

04:24.028 --> 04:36.843
their best effort, would not... Americans would 
fly them into an LZ and have to push them out of the

04:24.028 --> 04:36.843
helicopters. I had a South Vietnamese unit fire at 
me one time. I had a South Vietnamese Air Force bird

04:44.172 --> 04:50.419
dog pilot fire rockets at American troops. and he 
knew they were American troops. And I actually

04:53.419 --> 05:00.568
had, he did that a couple of times and one day we got 
orders to, if we could shoot him down to do so. And he

05:01.128 --> 05:05.954
flew off and turned his aircraft over to the enemy 
somewhere. He left the area. Did you feel that they

05:07.837 --> 05:13.443
wanted y'all there, but they wanted you to do all 
the work? Yeah, some wanted us there and wanted us

05:13.503 --> 05:16.828
to do all the work. Others wanted our money. You 
know, what they could make off the GIs selling

05:19.306 --> 05:25.495
things.

05:26.517 --> 05:27.679
I didn't really care about that. I had my job to do. I 
didn't really care what the Vietnamese thought.

05:33.548 --> 05:37.173
Do you think that other people did? That they were 
angry that they weren't fighting as hard as them?

05:40.658 --> 05:41.059
Oh yeah. Well, I got angry at them too. I really did. 
A lot of Americans were disgusted with the

05:43.623 --> 05:47.068
Vietnamese and their You know, there's a lot of 
warlike people in the world. South Vietnamese

05:53.137 --> 05:55.840
aren't one of them. North Vietnamese are. 
Americans are fairly warlike. That's our

06:02.667 --> 06:03.908
history. We're not the only ones, but we're one of 
them. I just don't think the South Vietnamese are.

06:09.174 --> 06:15.100
Some were very, very good, but the majority of them 
were just below average. Can you describe... a

06:18.014 --> 06:24.286
pleasant memory that you have or an experience 
that you take? Well,

06:24.306 --> 06:31.941
in country,

06:24.306 --> 06:31.941
we had some good parties. We could get lobster tail 
for 50 cents. We were so out by ourselves during

06:35.829 --> 06:40.478
that platoon that we had to We'd go to ration 
breakdown, and we'd give them rides on our

06:41.065 --> 06:46.272
airplanes and invite them to our parties, and so 
they'd give us steaks. We went to Fan Rang, which is

06:46.592 --> 06:51.939
a big Air Force base halfway between Pantheon and 
Cameron. A big Air Force base, just like

06:53.301 --> 06:55.765
stateside. Theaters with plush seats and a real 
nice officer's club and 10,000-foot runway. We

07:02.754 --> 07:07.360
got two cases of steaks from ration breakdown up 
there, and And I flew those two cases and an Air

07:08.150 --> 07:14.417
Force guy back to a party that was waiting for me at 
the LZ in our hangar. And I got back and the winds

07:15.638 --> 07:19.842
were 25 knots and 90 degrees to the runway. And the 
plane was overloaded and out of balance because I

07:21.484 --> 07:29.353
had one case of stakes in the back behind the guy 
sitting in the back seat and one on his lap. And

07:29.393 --> 07:30.774
those are heavy things. Plus we were loaded up with 
radios and armored seat and all this other stuff.

07:35.690 --> 07:42.877
And it was a foolish, foolish thing to do, but all 
those guys were waiting for me on the ground for the

07:35.690 --> 07:42.877
party to start so they could cook the steaks. And I 
had to land, and I thought that was pretty fun. I did

07:46.941 --> 07:47.601
it. I got it in safely. You saved the party. Mm-hmm. 
And also, I bailed out some people that were in

07:53.247 --> 07:58.692
trouble, but I'll always treasure that. Mm-hmm. 
And the friendships that were. Mm-hmm. Oh, we made

08:02.015 --> 08:04.558
some good friends and lost some good friends. 
Mm-hmm. Do you think that would be the most

08:05.575 --> 08:11.422
difficult part, is losing your friends? Yeah. 
What do you think, losing your friends? Was being a

08:15.247 --> 08:19.393
pilot, do you feel that that was better or worse 
than other types of? Far better, far better. Were

08:21.756 --> 08:22.937
you treated better? Yeah, we were part of the elite 
and we didn't get our hands too dirty except when we

08:22.997 --> 08:31.428
were pre-flight in the airplane. After I lived six 
months at the LZ, I moved into the hotel downtown.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.984
which was across the street from a school where Ho 
Chi Minh taught when he was younger. And so it was

08:39.965 --> 08:44.011
sort of a communist shrine. As a result, we were 
never hit while I was there because they were

08:44.031 --> 08:50.659
afraid of damage to the school across the street. 
Yeah, I lived well. I had a maid come in every day

08:53.663 --> 09:04.877
when I was at the hotel and wash my uniform and 
polish my boots and make my bed and clean the room

08:53.663 --> 09:04.877
and all this kind of stuff. It was not bad at all. Was 
there some resentment from the other types of

09:08.496 --> 09:12.561
soldiers? Not really. They liked having me 
overhead when they were in trouble. And in fact, I

09:19.369 --> 09:27.058
could go a number of places and not have to buy a 
drink because those guys were so glad to see me.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.622
Because they were so dependent on you. Yeah. How 
much contact did you have then with the United

09:31.874 --> 09:35.077
States? You said your wife was over there. Well, 
she wasn't there. I mean, she was in the States. But

09:39.722 --> 09:46.889
another group of people we invited to our parties 
ran the military radio, the Mars system. And they

09:48.110 --> 09:52.234
could call through, like, call ham operators back 
in the States. And they had a little device that

09:52.975 --> 09:56.038
they could dial your phone number. And it was like 
talking on the radio. And sometimes I'd the

10:00.916 --> 10:30.113
communication would be bad and so the guy on the 
other end would have to translate her and I'd tell

10:00.916 --> 10:30.113
her I love you over and she'd say I love you over but I 
could call her I usually call her about every other

10:00.916 --> 10:30.113
week I wrote therefore a few letters I wrote a 
number of letters but not as many as you might think

10:00.916 --> 10:30.113
I'm a poor letter writer but I got to call her quite a 
bit in fact a friend of mine and I were going to go to

10:00.916 --> 10:30.113
Hong Kong on on leave, and the last minute I said to 
him, I said, you know, you're a nice guy and all, but

10:30.565 --> 10:40.337
I'd rather see Ann in Hawaii than you in Hong Kong. 
So I called her on the phone and told her to fly to Los

10:40.357 --> 10:43.120
Angeles. She was staying with her parents in Fort 
Stockton, Texas. I said, fly to Los Angeles, and if

10:45.503 --> 10:50.830
I get out to Hawaii, I'll call you from Guam. And I 
called her from Guam, and she got to Hawaii a half

10:51.971 --> 10:55.015
hour after I did. So we went to Hawaii twice, R&R and 
leave. That was lucky. Yeah. And did she bring your

11:00.687 --> 11:01.969
son? No, but she brought movies. And I was going to 
ask you, what kind of information did she pass on to

11:05.974 --> 11:19.050
you through, I'm talking media and about how the 
war was, how people thought of it? We got Stars and

11:19.210 --> 11:24.917
Stripes newspaper, and they were very 
intellectually honest. We got the good news and

11:25.538 --> 11:27.420
the bad news. We knew all about the demonstrations 
and how bad they were getting. And the news came

11:31.754 --> 11:34.017
heavier and heavier. I was there when Neil 
Armstrong walked on the moon for the first time,

11:36.299 --> 11:43.308
and we got that in Stars and Stripes. We didn't have 
television where I was, but we did have radio.

11:47.954 --> 11:51.919
Armed Forces, it's AFVN, Armed Forces Radio 
Vietnam. And so we were pretty well informed. Did

11:56.866 --> 11:57.947
that make... Y'all angry that there were protests 
going

11:58.433 --> 12:04.539
on while you were there? Yeah, very much so. What 
was the worst or most difficult thing about being a

12:04.960 --> 12:11.246
pilot? Well, after I got over being scared, 
nothing. I mean, I enjoyed it. Like I said, I don't

12:17.052 --> 12:25.200
want to sound tacky, but I was really pretty good at 
doing what I did. And I got to the point, there's a

12:25.636 --> 12:31.404
difference between courage and conviction. 
Courage is going into a situation that you think

12:33.566 --> 12:38.032
you might get hurt and doing it anyway. Conviction 
is where you don't think they can touch you because

12:39.114 --> 12:43.539
you're that much better. Well, there were a couple 
of times where I went into situations where I

12:44.781 --> 12:51.049
thought I might get hurt and did it anyway. But most 
of the time, I felt they couldn't touch me. that I

12:54.998 --> 12:56.740
could get them before they could get me. And that's 
pretty much the way it was. Do you feel like you had

13:00.204 --> 13:05.911
conviction first and then it turned into courage? 
I don't know. The courage just happened when it

13:06.572 --> 13:08.894
happened. You didn't expect it or plan for it. I 
think... There was one time where a team was

13:16.565 --> 13:26.696
getting picked up, and they were taking fire, and 
they were in an exposed position, and they were

13:16.565 --> 13:26.696
taking fire from a tree line, and they were at 5,000 
feet, which is the top of this one mountain. And as

13:28.037 --> 13:31.260
heavy as my aircraft was, at that altitude, I 
couldn't climb. So I had four rockets, and I made

13:32.522 --> 13:42.212
four level passes at this tree line, and flew 
pretty close to it, firing into it. And then after I

13:43.133 --> 13:46.116
was out of rockets, I made two more passes because I 
thought maybe they wouldn't know that I was out of

13:46.552 --> 13:48.755
rockets. And it just seemed like the thing to do at 
the time. I'll tell you, I was a little antsy, you

13:53.861 --> 13:58.947
know, flying at that tree line that close, giving 
them a level shot at me. But the other times I would

14:00.669 --> 14:15.546
fly at night, and I'd have artillery on call, and 
I'd turn on all my lights on the aircraft and make it

14:00.669 --> 14:15.546
a target, and then I'd see their flashes when 
they'd fire at me, And then I'd call the artillery

14:15.796 --> 14:18.419
on the flashes. Well, that was not courage. That 
was conviction because I knew that I believed they

14:19.700 --> 14:29.391
couldn't hit me, that they were bad shots, and that 
I could hit them with artillery before they could

14:19.700 --> 14:29.391
hit me with ground fire. So, yeah, there was a 
couple of courage things, but mostly it was

14:29.752 --> 14:34.617
conviction. You feel that you're very lucky, 
extremely lucky. I am lucky to be here a number of

14:38.221 --> 14:40.824
times over. I've had... One time my son asked me to 
catalog all the things that happened to me to

14:43.252 --> 14:50.283
include after Vietnam and other flying. I was a 
flight instructor for a while and I flew for the

14:50.303 --> 14:52.988
reserves for a while. I've had over 30 incidents, 
16 of which were life-threatening.

15:00.199 --> 15:10.035
I had several crashes and a flare shoot on my wing 
and a night in the mountains with no instruments

15:00.199 --> 15:10.035
and no radio aids and in and out of clouds. The flare 
shoot I could give you if you had time, I could give

15:10.977 --> 15:17.105
you a chapter and verse of what happened that 
night, everything. I remember every detail. The

15:19.788 --> 15:22.211
night in the mountains, we were looking for a lost 
IRP team. I can't tell you how I got in. I can tell you

15:25.275 --> 15:28.098
what happened once I was in, but I can't tell you how 
I got out. I just don't know. It's a blank. Can you

15:33.445 --> 15:37.069
talk about your group of friends, and do you still 
talk to them? I've pretty much lost track of them,

15:37.758 --> 15:45.825
but I'm going to have a 25-year celebration May 6th 
of 1995. I had a 20-year celebration, and that's

15:45.925 --> 15:54.013
the day I got back May 6th of 1970. And so in 1990 I had 
one, and in 1995 I'm going to have one, and this time

15:55.134 --> 16:00.799
I'm going to try and track some of them down. I kept 
in touch with a few of them for a while, about four of

16:01.580 --> 16:06.364
them. But, no, actually, one, two, three, four, 
five, kept in touch with six of them. And over the

16:17.008 --> 16:18.991
years, I'm such a poor letter writer. I mean, I 
don't even keep in touch with my relatives. So I've

16:22.717 --> 16:28.225
lost track, but you get to this age, and you want to 
make those contacts again. So I'm going to track

16:28.846 --> 16:33.853
them down and invite them to the party and figure if 
I give them a year's notice, they ought to be able to

16:28.846 --> 16:33.853
make it. But I made some really, really good 
friends, and we did some super things together.

16:42.416 --> 16:44.097
One was an Air Force pilot. A couple were guys in my 
platoon. One guy named Ed Pennington, and as I

16:47.941 --> 17:00.652
recall and understand that I'm telling you things 
best as I remember, he had played football for the

16:47.941 --> 17:00.652
University of Texas. He was a big guy, red-headed 
guy. one of the kind of people that everybody

17:05.103 --> 17:08.727
gravitates toward. He was the center of whatever 
social group was there. Usually the big men on

17:14.693 --> 17:24.763
campus like that, you might think he'd be a little 
stuck up, but he made everybody feel like they were

17:14.693 --> 17:24.763
his close personal friend. He did not 
discriminate. He was nice to everybody. And a

17:30.328 --> 17:33.051
month before he was due to leave, He took a sweep 
with a, he was an advisor to a South Vietnamese

17:33.841 --> 17:43.214
unit, and he took a sweep for a fellow who was sick, 
one of the other Americans who was sick. And he took

17:44.896 --> 17:47.460
a direct hit with a mortar round and was killed. And 
there were several tragedies that occurred while

17:49.363 --> 17:59.897
I was there, but I will tell you that the loss of that 
individual is as big a loss as I can think of. So Ed

17:59.917 --> 18:03.342
Pennington is somebody I'll always remember.

18:06.275 --> 18:19.036
Do you, I mean, can you kind of remember when you 
first got home and when you were coming home, the

18:06.275 --> 18:19.036
attitudes of yourself, your family, friends, and 
also other Americans that did not fight? Well, the

18:20.278 --> 18:24.064
first thing that happened was we were, there were a 
few of us who were getting short. That's what you

18:24.565 --> 18:26.488
call it when you're due to leave. You go to your date 
of return from overseas. It's called DEROS. And

18:32.117 --> 18:32.518
there were Four or five of us sitting around 
talking one day, we were all due to leave at about

18:32.819 --> 18:42.809
the same time, and we were saying, boy, it's going 
to be good to get back, and I'm looking forward to

18:32.819 --> 18:42.809
getting out of here and go back to the world, and all 
those expressions that we used. And I don't

18:44.030 --> 18:49.255
remember who it was, but somebody said, you know, 
I'm going to miss it. And we all admitted what we had

18:49.275 --> 18:56.362
been feeling, but nobody had said was that we were 
going to miss it. And if I didn't have a wife and

18:56.382 --> 19:00.566
child waiting for me, I would have extended. 
Really? And stayed over there. because it was an

19:02.806 --> 19:08.996
intense experience, one I'll not trade for. It was 
really incredible. But when we were out

19:11.520 --> 19:15.446
processing, there were guys who were getting 
30-day drops. They were getting out of country 30

19:16.628 --> 19:18.211
days early. And helicopter pilots, a lot of the 
units, would walk up to a guy when he's preparing

19:18.591 --> 19:26.704
for a flight one day and say, you're not going, 
you're not flying anymore.

19:34.784 --> 19:48.460
Anyway, I was supposed to be back in the States on 
May 5th, and things were a little intense right

19:34.784 --> 19:48.460
then, and they were short people. And on May 3rd,

19:48.480 --> 19:58.251
I think it was May 3rd, an American was killed in my 
province. You know, we didn't have that many

19:59.453 --> 20:02.496
Americans killed. one to a mine, one to a sniper, 
one to a mortar round, or a route to a small action or

20:02.932 --> 20:11.841
something like that. But we didn't lose that many. 
And so when one was killed, it was a big deal. And we

20:17.167 --> 20:20.650
went after whoever.

20:21.351 --> 20:26.376
And so on May 3rd or 4th, we'd been having a lot of 
things going on, and I had delayed going to

20:21.351 --> 20:26.376
out-process. And it was May 4th. was this guy got 
killed, and so Bobby Beale, the guy who was my stick

20:31.400 --> 20:44.637
buddy in flight school and has served with me the 
whole time there in Fanfiette, which is a real

20:31.400 --> 20:44.637
unusual coincidence. You know, most commissions 
officers only flew for six months, then would get a

20:44.797 --> 20:50.464
ground assignment of some kind. And I flew the 
whole year with Bobby. And we were going to

20:54.589 --> 20:58.534
out-process together. And... It was just a real 
strange confluence that put us in the same

21:00.188 --> 21:03.032
platoon.

21:05.896 --> 21:15.769
But we did this deal where after a while you could 
tell if a trail had been used recently because of

21:05.896 --> 21:15.769
the color of the dirt on it. And if you got real low 
and dropped all your flaps and flew very slow into

21:15.789 --> 21:22.197
the wind, sometimes you could see clearly enough 
which direction they were going. You could tell by

21:26.587 --> 21:27.307
the footprints. And so we would fly on the bushes. 
And again, that didn't bother me. I was in control,

21:32.573 --> 21:37.137
so it wasn't courage, it was conviction. But the 
other guy would fly up high as sort of a cover in case

21:37.157 --> 21:42.462
anything popped. So we were looking for this guy, 
for this group of guys that killed the American,

21:44.204 --> 21:49.790
and didn't find him. But that was, like, the day 
before I was supposed to have gone back. And I had

21:54.106 --> 21:56.469
already called Ann and told her I was on my way. 
Well, the protests had been pretty hot and heavy

21:58.332 --> 22:00.916
anyway. And the day after I left, our LZ was hit 
pretty hard with sappers and the rocket attack.

22:12.093 --> 22:16.120
And somewhere in there was a Cambodian invasion. 
So I went to Quignon to out process and went to Nha

22:16.140 --> 22:19.605
Trang for lunch on the way back down and then went to 
Cameron and gave him, turned over the airplane and

22:20.041 --> 22:26.272
went out to the out processing center. So I 
actually left the day after I was supposed to.

22:30.659 --> 22:34.847
Well, by that time Kent State had happened. And

22:35.147 --> 22:44.243
they said, if you're in uniform, you're liable to 
get some pretty rough treatment.

22:54.517 --> 23:01.448
said we could travel out of uniform because they 
said, you know, people are getting spit on and

22:54.517 --> 23:01.448
attacked and stuff like that. And nobody in my 
group took their uniform off. We all traveled in

23:06.396 --> 23:08.679
uniform. We had our TWs and we got our ribbons, you 
know, and I had the wings. And I was pretty proud of

23:11.744 --> 23:13.226
what I'd done. So we flew into Seattle Tacoma 
Airport. And there were about three of us. that

23:22.090 --> 23:24.814
went into the restaurant there at Sea Tank. And we 
couldn't get served.

23:36.070 --> 23:39.134
We'd try and stop a waitress, and they'd just look 
at us and walk on.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.762
So I made the connection to Midland. And at Midland 
Airport, Midland Air Terminal, my wife and her

23:46.264 --> 23:51.051
parents were there with my son. And there was one of 
those billboards out by the ramp with the stick-on

23:53.461 --> 23:57.306
letters.

24:00.952 --> 24:05.458
By that time, I'd made Captain, and it said, 
Welcome Home, Captain Anderson. And the first

24:05.478 --> 24:11.567
thing I did when I saw that sign was look to see who 
was going to tear it down. But I was back in Texas,

24:13.990 --> 24:16.834
and things were okay there.

24:21.641 --> 24:22.202
So that's We went out to California to see my 
parents, and I was in civilian clothes and went

24:23.887 --> 24:30.296
into a shopping mall. Some hippie said, sign this 
petition to stop the baby killing in Vietnam.

24:47.300 --> 24:51.987
I have plenty of clearance to shoot people that I 
thought were civilians, and we didn't shoot. And

24:54.616 --> 24:55.998
Ann just sort of led me away.

24:59.742 --> 25:01.364
But homecoming was not good. It was good to see Ann 
and the

25:02.465 --> 25:20.867
family, but it was

25:02.465 --> 25:20.867
not what my dad received.

25:21.348 --> 25:21.508
Mm-hmm. No, he deserved everything.

25:25.936 --> 25:28.398
Anyway, what else? Do you feel that drugs were a 
problem? Do you feel that? Well, they weren't

25:33.283 --> 25:34.604
where I was. They were at the large depots, and I 
heard that later they were in the line units, but

25:35.084 --> 25:48.056
mostly the rear echelon people.

25:48.737 --> 25:54.542
We had some marijuana growing in the wire at Donk 10 
where the, not just my company, but other units

25:55.973 --> 25:59.819
were headquartered. And very so often they'd go 
burn it out and pretty soon be grown again. The guys

26:04.165 --> 26:12.298
with little to do got bored and a lot of those folks 
that did drugs there did drugs in the States. I

26:12.758 --> 26:19.889
mean, it wasn't the war that caused them to

26:12.758 --> 26:19.889
do drugs. I'm a student of history now. Since my 
generation, has no idea what your generation went

26:25.572 --> 26:29.115
through with Vietnam.

26:31.718 --> 26:36.202
Do you feel that there are some misconceptions 
that my generation has? Some half-truths? Well,

26:40.966 --> 26:42.608
yeah, I think so. The one half-truth is that it's a 
little falsehood that's been perpetrated that we

26:42.648 --> 26:53.638
could not have won. We did have it won, and we could 
have won had we fought it like a real war. That's

26:58.770 --> 27:00.171
number one. We never fought it like a real war. 
Johnson had route packages. He picked targets

27:06.578 --> 27:17.670
that were of no significance from the White House, 
contrary to the advice of his Joint Chiefs of

27:06.578 --> 27:17.670
Staff. He had our pilots who flew into the north, 
which is some of the toughest flying in history,

27:23.977 --> 27:25.178
That took courage. That was courageous flying. 
They had to follow route packages. So the North

27:31.244 --> 27:41.995
Vietnamese with Russian help put up the most 
sophisticated air defense the world has ever

27:31.244 --> 27:41.995
known along those route packages, and those guys 
had to fly through that. That was criminal. If we'd

27:44.137 --> 27:49.562
fought this like a real war, we could have won that 
war, and no one can tell me otherwise. Another

27:50.420 --> 27:56.628
half-truth is that we made a practice of killing 
civilians, women and children. Ann Landers had a

27:56.648 --> 28:04.499
column recently in the newspaper where she talked 
about, she used the expression, trained to kill

27:56.648 --> 28:04.499
women and babies. Ann Landers used that less than a 
month ago in the paper. We weren't trained to kill

28:10.927 --> 28:13.130
civilians. We went out of our way to kill, to not 
kill civilians. World War II, they made war on the

28:17.656 --> 28:22.883
civilian population as a matter of policy. In 
Vietnam, we sweated and strained not to kill

28:22.943 --> 28:28.531
civilians. There would be people in a prohibited 
area, in a free-fire zone that you could shoot

28:28.611 --> 28:33.879
anything that moved. I had clearance to fire and 
said, no, these are civilians. We're letting them

28:38.545 --> 28:40.468
go. And that was a judgment call. They may not have 
been, but they looked like civilians, and I'd

28:41.910 --> 28:46.937
rather not shoot them. We did a good job. The 
people, the American servicemen that I worked

28:49.116 --> 28:54.901
with over there were good troops. They were good at 
their jobs. They did it with dedication. They

28:58.224 --> 29:02.268
could have kept their head down for a year and gone 
home. But they hung it out to do the job right. They

29:06.832 --> 29:07.693
were good at it. And like I said earlier, if an 
American was in trouble, people would do anything

29:07.993 --> 29:14.239
to get that American out of trouble. They would 
risk their lives on a regular basis We had a case

29:17.815 --> 29:22.039
where a team of these LURPS were going into an LZ. I 
was flying high, directing the helicopter from LZ

29:22.299 --> 29:25.722
to LZ. The one we had picked, we set them down. You 
always had to know which one you were going to set

29:29.065 --> 29:34.951
them on because you need to know where they are. And 
they need to know where they get off so they can find

29:35.011 --> 29:40.536
their way around. It was a hillside. The 
helicopter set down with one skid on the side of the

29:41.517 --> 29:47.282
hill, making sure the rotor blades were The guys 
got out of the helicopter. He took off. It happened

29:51.257 --> 29:55.924
to be what is called a hot LZ, or North Vietnamese in 
the tree line. They opened fire on this team and the

29:55.944 --> 29:59.549
helicopter. The helicopter took hits, took one 
round through the rotor blade, which set up a

29:59.570 --> 30:05.298
vibration. Instead of leaving the area, this guy 
did as tight a turn as you can do in a helicopter,

30:06.320 --> 30:14.772
came back in under fire, sat down on the ground, and 
sat there until everybody got on board while he was

30:15.325 --> 30:21.774
taking fire and then flew off. Now you can't get 
better than that. His name was Cartwright, by the

30:29.304 --> 30:30.586
way. He was a warrant officer. Flew for the 192nd. 
He was a real big guy and he had a handlebar mustache

30:33.671 --> 30:41.321
and so we called him

30:33.671 --> 30:41.321
Hoss. The company commander of that unit flew out 
one time to get a guy who'd been hit, who was in

30:44.047 --> 30:50.033
triple canopy jungle. The company commander went 
out, flew a Huey helicopter down through that

30:50.053 --> 31:03.927
triple canopy, hovering, 300 feet off the ground, 
the tops of the trees, hovered down, moved over,

30:50.053 --> 31:03.927
hovered down, moved over, hovered down, until he 
got down. He didn't have a penetrator, a jungle

31:04.588 --> 31:09.313
penetrator, so he had to get down there to get the 
guy on board. He put him on board and he went back up.

31:11.295 --> 31:13.497
Some of the best flying you can imagine. And the 
other thing I'd like to say is those same people are

31:14.438 --> 31:27.431
now some of your most productive citizens, some of 
the pillars of the community, some of the best

31:14.438 --> 31:27.431
professionals and business people in our society 
today. They are not the malcontents that you see

31:28.172 --> 31:38.263
that go to every parade looking for sympathy, 
dressed in this ragtag uniform, saying, oh, woe is

31:28.172 --> 31:38.263
me. Most of those guys either never served in the 
military or never served in Vietnam or never

31:42.805 --> 31:54.368
served in a combat unit, my perception is the vast 
majority of them are worthless misfits because

31:42.805 --> 31:54.368
the guys that I know who did the
