00:03.052 --> 00:09.339
This is Deborah Beale, and I am interviewing Dr. 
Spencer Beane on the history of Texas Engineering

00:03.052 --> 00:09.339
Experiment Station. The date is June 6, 1984. So 
the first

00:12.102 --> 00:23.034
thing, you did give a biographical statement in 
that one interview. You had your fill in that one,

00:23.054 --> 00:27.219
so I was going to make you go through that again if 
you'd like to. But I would like you to update some of

00:27.339 --> 00:30.162
the biography there. At that time, you were... 
they were just setting up no

00:40.261 --> 00:58.262
Since this is an update of the oral history that we 
have,

00:40.261 --> 00:58.262
I'll just kind of correct that. I had already been 
the director over here at the Center for

00:58.282 --> 01:02.787
International Support, and I had been 
hand-in-hand, and I think it's probably worth it.

01:02.807 --> 01:03.568
You've got the view in there that I... It was just 
take over or something like that. Well, they did,

01:10.685 --> 01:13.309
they had a little extra interest. They were still 
successful students from that community. Yes, at

01:15.552 --> 01:19.498
that time, it looked like I was going to be 
full-time here, which I didn't. You could tell

01:19.518 --> 01:21.701
that. Because I am an engineer. My loyalty is to 
engineering. My objective in life was to be an

01:27.490 --> 01:32.357
engineer and all those good things, and so I wanted 
to do it. with the Ateez

01:33.805 --> 01:45.681
organization and who

01:33.805 --> 01:45.681
I am. So that's the

01:45.701 --> 01:50.107
part that's really changed since 1981. I've been a 
quarter-time engineering experiment station,

01:50.127 --> 01:52.510
three-quarter-time here at the Center. And I 
continue to get involved and

01:55.709 --> 02:17.183
serve God and get people active and get people to 
understand. I hope a million things because I

02:17.203 --> 02:18.946
think that's what makes me very good. I think we're 
solving problems. We're involved in solving

02:19.607 --> 02:20.308
problems. And there's students involved in 
solving problems and there are graduates because

02:20.328 --> 02:22.712
they're involved in solving problems.

02:25.747 --> 02:42.229
How

02:25.747 --> 02:42.229
did you first become

02:25.747 --> 02:42.229
successful

02:25.747 --> 02:42.229
with these materials? Well, I had a Ph.D. from 
Caltech in mechanical and electrical

02:42.249 --> 02:43.892
engineering in 1950. I spent 20 years in the Army in 
their missile research development. And in 1970,

02:47.144 --> 03:06.191
I was only 50

02:47.144 --> 03:06.191
years old and decided that if I wanted to have

02:47.144 --> 03:06.191
a second career, I needed to be out of the Army. So I 
was out of the Army. And I didn't have a job. But

03:09.076 --> 03:15.565
because of my Caltech degrees,

03:16.642 --> 03:43.071
And they made me a real good offer, but at the same 
time living in Washington,

03:16.642 --> 03:43.071
D.C., living in that area.

03:44.198 --> 03:57.580
for five years during my 20 years of research

03:44.198 --> 03:57.580
about the hectic nature of just getting to and from 
work. And so we

03:58.982 --> 04:10.200
didn't want to move back to the Forks. So I 
interviewed also in the University of Alabama in

04:10.220 --> 04:11.522
Huntsville. I later

04:12.430 --> 04:30.550
moved here and I moved in Austin

04:12.430 --> 04:30.550
and I offered a job in Austin and I offered a job 
here. And I could have had a job in El Paso, but I

04:30.570 --> 04:32.673
didn't want that. And being an Aggie, I decided I 
wanted to come back to Texas A&M, come back home,

04:32.693 --> 04:35.335
and help develop a research program in Texas A&M. 
And I've done quite well, and I'm saying because of

04:35.355 --> 04:38.539
me. I

04:39.025 --> 04:53.690
feel like a part of it

04:39.025 --> 04:53.690
anyway. Since 1970, our sponsored research 
program, our global research program, has really

04:53.711 --> 05:00.021
expanded. It's gratifying. I've been a part of all 
this. Were you hired to be both assistant director

05:01.143 --> 05:03.227
and head of the space, or did one develop out of the 
other? I was hired as an assistant director and

05:05.975 --> 05:20.954
head of space technology, but we

05:05.975 --> 05:20.954
didn't make a big deal out of things like that. 
Things kind of grew. I hit the ground, and as you

05:21.395 --> 05:30.447
read in Billy Hathorne, the first project I worked 
on had

05:21.395 --> 05:30.447
nothing to do with space. It was the environmental 
aspects of the building and the amount of solar

05:30.807 --> 05:33.130
here. And I kind of did what they did. There weren't 
a whole lot of us at that time. Mr. Benson was the

05:46.598 --> 05:53.748
dean of engineering and the director, and Harriet 
Whitmore was the associate director, and there

05:46.598 --> 05:53.748
was me. And then we had a fiscal officer as well, who 
was part legal. Mr. Fenner and Mr. Whitmore

06:00.700 --> 06:12.054
and myself and

06:00.700 --> 06:12.054
Mr. Henson. We just did what we needed to do. We 
managed to stay busy and active and we managed to

06:15.499 --> 06:18.082
get other people impacted and involved. So I would 
say that the Kresge organization was involved

06:18.102 --> 06:25.071
over the many years starting in 1940. I mean, 
Spence thought that the industries and urban

06:27.008 --> 06:42.510
populations of the state of Texas really needed 
some technical help, as well as the rural people

06:27.008 --> 06:42.510
being in the Gulf. I mean, it's evolved. I think 
that the real growth,

06:44.493 --> 06:56.610
indeed, started with Harry Whitson in 1963,

06:44.493 --> 06:56.610
because Harry had been Army research

06:57.721 --> 07:14.699
and

06:57.721 --> 07:14.699
development also means familiar with how 
contracting is done and the administrative

06:57.721 --> 07:14.699
aspects of that. Plus, being an A&M in the core, you 
learn the need for organization. You learn in the

07:19.544 --> 07:27.492
Army the need for authority and organization, 
follow-up, and the formality requirements of

07:19.544 --> 07:27.492
contracting. So I think that our

07:27.910 --> 07:41.270
main growth has come since the 1960s.

07:45.316 --> 07:51.005
And then it's like I said, we're most of the shuttle 
research grants. You read that in there. It was

07:51.505 --> 07:52.246
$15,000 total. That's all we had. And I guess in the 
final analysis, we've done about the same thing.

07:56.716 --> 07:59.980
of shuttle related work. We're still doing 
shuttle related work. So it's good that the folks

08:02.763 --> 08:10.831
in that program have confidence in them and 
confidence in our researchers. That's what makes

08:10.851 --> 08:12.393
success. And A&M will be successful as long as they 
can deliver quality results and get people that

08:14.135 --> 08:23.685
want to do quality research. Who did you deal with 
inside and outside of the team? Everybody.

08:31.695 --> 08:33.317
Everybody? Anybody and everybody that wanted to 
be involved in some research or we thought we

08:33.337 --> 08:43.530
needed for some research. Like the Navasol 
project, we have 45 professionals from all over

08:43.550 --> 08:50.820
the university. And

08:51.543 --> 09:12.052
they

08:51.543 --> 09:12.052
were involved

08:51.543 --> 09:12.052
in an extensive conference, one-week 
conference. And then later, the consultant

09:12.072 --> 09:13.534
started to play, to read the final report. To my 
knowledge, that was the first major participant

09:13.554 --> 09:15.357
in the project that anyone else had. You had direct 
access to it. You didn't have to go through your

09:18.455 --> 09:19.317
pay. I never... An organization, in my mind, is 
something that is a guide for people to have a home

09:20.158 --> 09:34.737
in the first place. But if you need to get outside 
your organization, do it. You've got to know other

09:39.142 --> 09:43.548
people outside your organization. You can't look 
internally at them. Because

09:45.998 --> 10:12.596
many of the complex

09:45.998 --> 10:12.596
problems today require expertise from 
veterinary homes, effects of lasers on the eyes,

09:45.998 --> 10:12.596
effects of chemicals, toxicants, and so forth, 
from humans and animals. It's got to involve a lot

10:12.616 --> 10:14.158
of other people to do all the work. Have the 
administrations at A&M been helpful in letting

10:14.179 --> 10:15.921
you do that in a timely manner? Well, we get along.

10:25.695 --> 10:32.562
And any organization, as complex as A&M, any 
organization will work if people want to work. And

10:34.004 --> 10:48.439
if people want to work together, they will work 
together, in spite of problems, in spite of

10:34.004 --> 10:48.439
bureaucracy, in spite of administrative 
hang-ups and regulations that says thou shall

10:34.004 --> 10:48.439
not. You can still use those regulations as a guide 
to the norm, but if you have to make an exception and

10:48.773 --> 11:00.187
you have to get an exception, go get it. If you just 
accept no's all the time, you don't go anywhere.

11:11.582 --> 11:12.603
You have to accept the challenges. I'll just use a 
good example. The court happens to be sitting on my

11:16.904 --> 11:27.562
desk

11:16.904 --> 11:27.562
right now. And it just happened to be there because 
I haven't seen it since. This project evolved from

11:36.297 --> 11:38.220
one of our projects, or a number of our projects, in 
December of 2011. Center for Environmental

11:38.740 --> 11:58.698
Resources is an organization

11:38.740 --> 11:58.698
that serves throughout the university system. We 
have projects with Tom and Alex, and we have

11:58.718 --> 12:03.402
projects with Prairie View, Forest Service, and 
the Coastal Recruitment Station. Wherever a

12:04.143 --> 12:06.165
researcher is who wants to do something, And if we 
can help him with small amounts of money, or

12:06.635 --> 12:25.943
providing him with contacts with sponsors and 
outside organizations,

12:06.635 --> 12:25.943
or help him just develop an inquisitiveness into a 
subject, we do it. The project that I'm looking at

12:26.817 --> 12:39.573
is a $500,000 a year project for three years in the 
agricultural and family space. And Dr. Hyler is

12:39.693 --> 12:46.481
the principal investigator and has a contract 
with the Gas Research Institute. And as I said,

12:46.501 --> 12:52.048
many of the parts of this project came from those 
seed projects, those encouragements that we've

12:52.653 --> 13:02.343
given to researchers, not only in agriculture, 
but in engineering. They've got guys on here from

13:03.264 --> 13:16.838
engineering who are participating, Guy Curry, an 
engineer, an industrial engineer, system

13:03.264 --> 13:16.838
engineering, We have, uh, helping these people 
also are folks from . But here's an example of

13:23.822 --> 13:30.109
cooperation that has paid off. All of these 
researchers, and this researcher,

13:30.129 --> 13:41.702
I think they're, uh, uh, like 19 researchers in a 
separate project. And it's a good thing because,

13:41.722 --> 13:44.445
uh, It's looking at new alternate resources for 
the future, new ways of developing crops to

13:45.117 --> 14:04.061
produce energy, things like gas,

13:45.117 --> 14:04.061
natural gas, in the case of gas recertification. 
But you can't always stay within your own

14:04.081 --> 14:07.986
organization with a crop. We've got to get people 
from other disciplines involved. Is that what

14:18.078 --> 14:24.167
TEAS has been all about since you came here? TEAS 
has been growing in a lot of different ways. A lot of

14:25.990 --> 14:30.717
our projects have been interdisciplinary and 
based on cooperation with others. We've

14:31.220 --> 14:53.515
had

14:31.220 --> 14:53.515
projects with them at college, and with 
agriculture, and with science, and, you know,

14:31.220 --> 14:53.515
sometimes that doesn't go anywhere for people to 
work with. But they've got to want to work with you,

14:53.535 --> 14:54.797
or they will not. It's a matter of developing that 
attitude. Has that attitude improved or stayed

14:57.258 --> 15:10.955
the same pretty much since you've been here, or has 
it gotten worse? Well, right at the present time,

15:10.975 --> 15:14.880
we're having some organizational difficulties. 
We've got people starting to sit and wait. I would

15:17.123 --> 15:19.165
say that right at the present time, we are at some 
crossroads. People have got to want to work, do

15:20.005 --> 15:27.936
research, and they've got to want to do it within 
the system that exists. Or they spend their time in

15:27.956 --> 15:37.109
a wasteful circle, fighting

15:27.956 --> 15:37.109
the system. And I don't like that. I think 
people... with a can-do attitude, wanting to do

15:37.910 --> 15:49.212
things, are going to find ways to make the 
organization work. I mean, any organization will

15:49.232 --> 15:54.922
work if people want to. And I'm upset about that. 
Because we've got people who are wasting time

15:55.824 --> 15:59.952
arguing about it. Is that something that's 
happened on and off since you've been here, or is

16:00.455 --> 16:06.624
this a new development? Well, there's always been 
some of that. There are always people. University

16:13.613 --> 16:18.080
is a unique place because there are unique people. 
There are all kinds of people. There are some

16:20.503 --> 16:26.091
people who are going to stand up and argue against 
anything and everything. And then there are going

16:26.459 --> 16:33.211
to be those on the other end who are going to stand up 
and fight for everything. Some people are naive.

16:34.313 --> 16:35.775
Some people are positive. Some people want to do 
research. Some people don't want to do research.

16:39.983 --> 16:45.092
Some people think that research detracts from 
their scholastic achievements. Some other

16:45.172 --> 16:48.518
people think that research is essential. to their 
development and to their achievement in the human

16:48.852 --> 16:54.237
profession. And there's all a great spectrum of 
people in the world, all classes, all kinds. And

17:03.164 --> 17:17.196
it's a real challenge to present opportunities to 
do things through this broad spectrum and see the

17:03.164 --> 17:17.196
different responses that you get from people. I 
think that psychologists, But it's a big role in

17:19.177 --> 17:25.293
university research. And that's where I spend 
most of my time, I guess I should say, on doing just

17:25.473 --> 17:33.454
that. I have given seminars. I've considered

17:36.220 --> 17:49.653
teaching in mechanical

17:36.220 --> 17:49.653
engineering. It's a part-time

17:49.673 --> 17:56.820
job. I've worked in the M.T.' 's administration. 
I've worked with air in the plane. I've worked with

18:02.085 --> 18:03.466
all the federal agencies and all the 
quasi-agencies. Yes, we're a research

18:03.486 --> 18:04.127
institute. I decided I'd just take it, but I didn't 
have the time to do that. Try

18:05.988 --> 18:30.021
to

18:05.988 --> 18:30.021
teach a bunch of students and then you have to leave 
town and not do a good job. I didn't teach. Trying to

18:30.361 --> 18:31.462
find opportunities for people to do research. And 
many times being disappointed by not being able to

18:31.482 --> 18:34.246
find people to do research on projects where there 
was a great opportunity outside. But that's the

18:34.266 --> 18:34.847
way things go. Well,

18:35.317 --> 18:57.291
my attitude is that

18:58.722 --> 19:24.627
students were on the future of this nation and 
trained and empowered by our first reason for

18:58.722 --> 19:24.627
being here. And I think I've adopted the attitude 
that I've heard written by many people, including

19:24.647 --> 19:28.611
Bill, and all these other associations, the 
National Science Foundation, the U.S. National

19:24.647 --> 19:28.611
Science Foundation, The

19:29.536 --> 19:47.642
attitude seems to be developing that a good 
university must be

19:29.536 --> 19:47.642
involved in research. And that if A&M is to be an 
outstanding university, its professors must be

19:47.662 --> 19:55.634
involved, its students

19:47.662 --> 19:55.634
must be involved. So my attitude has been that A, 
our first loyalty, our first purpose for being is

19:57.633 --> 20:05.872
the student. But then in turn, the professors

20:05.892 --> 20:12.568
are the professors. And the students are better 
than graduates

20:15.554 --> 20:30.300
if they've been involved in a research project, 
because then they learn that continued success

20:15.554 --> 20:30.300
depends upon producing acceptable results. And 
it's all part of a training for a leadership role in

20:30.320 --> 20:35.790
the future. I was involved for many years with the 
co-op. I think it's an excellent, excellent

20:43.602 --> 20:58.842
opportunity for a youngster, regardless of his 
financial status, to get an education and learn

20:43.602 --> 20:58.842
the outside world at the same time. Many times, the 
industries that hire that go out during the

20:58.822 --> 21:17.002
alternate

20:58.822 --> 21:17.002
periods end up hiring them for a long time . And the 
student's happier working for a company that he

21:17.022 --> 21:24.129
knows, and the company's happier because they 
know the student because he's worked for them. But

21:24.149 --> 21:28.474
I was very much involved in that when we were closer 
together with the College of Engineering. I have

21:29.264 --> 21:39.616
the, on the steak prize, industrial sponsors 
would provide the steaks. And the wives

21:39.636 --> 21:49.047
of the faculty, and the team's wives too, would 
bring cakes and different vegetables and things.

21:49.548 --> 21:51.390
And we'd have a picnic out in the park, the pencil 
park or over there. right

21:51.877 --> 21:58.585
at the center or wherever. And I would get the 
students together and say, okay, now you go get the

21:58.825 --> 22:09.337
stakes, and you go get the wood for the fire, and you 
go get the tongs, and you go get this. And we'd get

22:09.477 --> 22:16.905
over there a couple hours early and we'd cut those 
stakes up and get them ready and took them. We had a

22:16.925 --> 22:17.325
lot of fun. In fact, we got together a lot. And I 
think those sorts of things I

22:20.294 --> 22:44.298
did

22:20.294 --> 22:44.298
this sort

22:20.294 --> 22:44.298
of

22:20.294 --> 22:44.298
thing, and I participated with the American 
Society of Engineering Education, and was on the

22:20.294 --> 22:44.298
Engineering Research Council for a year, because 
I felt like I needed to know the faculty. I needed to

22:44.318 --> 22:45.079
interact with the faculty. They needed to know me, 
so I involved myself in a co-op program that Texas

22:45.099 --> 22:49.103
Society of Education was doing here, and the 
American Association of Engineering Advancing

22:45.099 --> 22:49.103
the Core of Engineering Education. And all those 
sort of things. So, I've enjoyed it. I love it. I

23:05.293 --> 23:05.493
love it. I want to continue to have that baggy 
spirit. Stand together. It's the heavy thing. So

23:07.527 --> 23:13.156
will any arguments about organization make me 
upset? Because I think we can continue our

23:13.516 --> 23:20.608
progress and make these organizations work. We 
want to. And as Aggies by and large, we've got to

23:22.070 --> 23:24.594
work. We've got to have a solid force. We've got to 
produce. Because we're going to be successful if

23:30.744 --> 23:35.391
we do. The Center for Energy and Mineral Resources 
is not a part of TEES. It's a university line item in

23:42.792 --> 23:48.078
the budget. It's not administered by TEES? No, it 
is not part of TEES at all. It is not part of TEES at

23:52.643 --> 23:54.765
all. It is completely separate from TEES. But it 
has a total system-wide responsibility. And as

24:02.489 --> 24:05.718
long as that continues, I'm happy. If somebody 
wants to say, now you can't give any projects to

24:06.160 --> 24:12.257
engineering. You can't give any to agriculture, 
because they're already there. or funded

24:17.238 --> 24:30.425
organization that eliminates developing people 
who have the potential of really doing something.

24:30.605 --> 24:38.942
Because in a larger organization, a lot of times 
the man's

24:30.605 --> 24:38.942
eyes don't get understood. Maybe we can help them 
be heard, be understood.

24:48.165 --> 24:49.366
Then they can shine. The keys can profit.

24:54.173 --> 24:56.036
That guy, big research project. Agriculture, big 
research project. And so I think that CEMR, It

25:04.235 --> 25:26.614
brings forth

25:04.235 --> 25:26.614
to me that A&M

25:04.235 --> 25:26.614
is a real

25:04.235 --> 25:26.614
strong company.

25:31.808 --> 25:42.304
The

25:31.808 --> 25:42.304
mid-1970s energy crisis,

25:31.808 --> 25:42.304
did that bring on a squirt of money and funds for 
energy research? Well, it brought on the

25:43.165 --> 25:53.601
legislature supporting this center, which was 
started in 75.

25:53.621 --> 25:56.726
Did Keith get involved in that type of research as 
well? Well, Keith is involved in that. A

25:59.652 --> 26:20.182
lot

25:59.652 --> 26:20.182
of

25:59.652 --> 26:20.182
the researchers over there are doing 
engineering. You can talk to some engineers and

26:20.202 --> 26:21.985
say everything that engineers do is 
engineering-based. If you're working on an

26:22.005 --> 26:23.447
engine, you're trying to make it more efficient. 
If you're working on a chemical process, you're

26:23.467 --> 26:25.350
trying to make it more efficient, energy-wise. 
All the chemical processes use natural gas for oil

26:25.370 --> 26:27.052
and for aerobics and electronics. Electrical 
engineering. generation of electricity is

26:28.357 --> 26:36.003
mostly by fossil fuel. That's got to be more 
efficient. So everything that the engineers do

26:39.393 --> 26:55.431
whether

26:39.393 --> 26:55.431
it be robotics, manufacturing

26:39.393 --> 26:55.431
engineering, is involved in . Yes, I'd say that the

26:55.451 --> 27:08.286
energy related work in engineering and in 
agriculture and in many parts of the system needs

26:55.451 --> 27:08.286
75%. Have

27:09.110 --> 27:30.339
you found in your working with Tease that there's 
been, Tease has seen the problems before, at least

27:09.110 --> 27:30.339
the legislature or a lot of other people, the 
problems that need to be addressed? Well, I think

27:30.359 --> 27:32.282
we think more through the future than the 
legislators do sometimes. And I think that given

27:32.735 --> 27:57.679
the resources that the legislature gives to TEAS 
allows TEAS to reflect on the future and to be

27:32.735 --> 27:57.679
involved in all these outside organizations and 
to be able to assess some of the future needs of the

27:32.735 --> 27:57.679
country and to start

28:00.106 --> 28:21.173
start getting

28:00.106 --> 28:21.173
together

28:00.106 --> 28:21.173
capabilities to help solve some of those kinds of 
problems or some of those kinds of developments,

28:00.106 --> 28:21.173
do some exploratory work. You see, the TEAS 
professors are a faculty member. A lot of them are

28:22.214 --> 28:25.118
doing basic research, fundamental research. I 
remember doing a lot of research,

28:25.773 --> 28:44.824
solving problems

28:25.773 --> 28:44.824
in a short period of time. But others are looking 
at, why does this do this? And it's a longer term

28:47.088 --> 28:47.689
payoff. It may not even be payoff. It's basic 
research. You don't know what the end result is

28:48.670 --> 28:49.772
going to be like. It might be a

28:50.849 --> 29:00.819
new design for a new car. Completely

29:01.099 --> 29:12.790
different from the configuration

29:01.099 --> 29:12.790
of the ones we've had in the past. They might fly the 
shuttle backwards instead of with the nose

29:12.810 --> 29:15.213
pointed forward. Or somebody comes up with a new 
theory that this has to happen. Everybody says it

29:16.754 --> 29:17.535
won't work. And some guy goes out and makes it work. 
I don't like people who have negative attitudes.

29:20.414 --> 29:23.512
I've already judged that. And I know people who say 
it can't be done. Because if you say that somebody

29:26.725 --> 29:34.333
can't do something, you're not bringing them up. 
Maybe a new theory will come. What I'm saying is

29:36.115 --> 29:47.648
that the engineering researchers are involved in 
the basic studies of what I think both of them need.

29:47.768 --> 29:51.012
And A&M, I think, has built its reputation based 
upon practical engineers, practical

29:52.055 --> 30:07.633
graduates,

29:52.055 --> 30:07.633
practical managers of the future. I think that 
Ford at one time sent a vice president out there and

30:07.653 --> 30:16.323
down here to look at A&M and find out why is A&M, why 
are A&M graduates good? Why do we have 34 in our top S

30:16.343 --> 30:17.304
and bottom three? Why are 34 good? How

30:19.544 --> 30:42.325
do you go about finding

30:19.544 --> 30:42.325
the funds for it? Well,

30:42.345 --> 30:48.471
it's a matter of salesmanship. convincing people 
that Aggies will be willing

30:49.750 --> 30:58.331
to try. We ran a workshop here for a gas research 
institute about three years ago. And we, I think,

31:02.879 --> 31:21.403
sold it based upon the attitude that, well, it's a 
darn difficult task to do in such a short period of

31:02.879 --> 31:21.403
time.

31:21.423 --> 31:24.026
But we're willing to undertake it. And we will 
deliver it. And we did deliver it. It's like one,

31:24.987 --> 31:25.628
two, three, four. We did finally deliver a quality 
product. And as a result of good relationships

31:27.390 --> 31:31.215
with the National Research Institute, projects 
like this helped us. Let me just

31:32.967 --> 31:47.854
say that TEAS is not just engineering.

31:49.100 --> 31:56.887
TEES started out being basically engineering. 
It's called the Engineering Experiment Study.

31:58.269 --> 32:03.413
But now the College of Education is involved with 
TEES and UCI technology for education purposes.

32:03.433 --> 32:13.383
Let's face it, satellites and microelectronics 
can play a part in disseminating information

32:03.433 --> 32:13.383
worldwide. We have classrooms in Nairobi that use 
satellites. But at any

32:19.390 --> 32:45.018
rate, education, liberal arts, geosciences,

32:19.390 --> 32:45.018
and who else? I was thinking of you. Well,

32:48.517 --> 33:04.677
we've got geosciences, liberal arts, business 
administration, business administration and

32:48.517 --> 33:04.677
education. Or the four other colleges. So about 
half of the colleges are now involved in TEAS

33:06.459 --> 33:11.385
research. And in addition to that, TEAS is on an 
outreach type of program. It's now a development

33:17.387 --> 33:29.343
program with Arlington, University of Texas at 
Arlington, cooperating in microelectronics

33:17.387 --> 33:29.343
and things like that, like research. Are those 
cooperations at the instigation of TEAS, or are

33:29.363 --> 33:41.338
these organizations coming to TEAS and saying... 
Well, I think this first started with TEAS at the

33:29.363 --> 33:41.338
instigation. But it just so happens that John 
Rouse, who's the Dean of Engineering up there, was

33:41.740 --> 33:50.210
the director of our own census team. So he's fully 
familiar with the TEAS organization and that

33:50.230 --> 34:04.626
helped bring in the cooperative agreement, which 
was approved by our Board of Regents, by the

33:50.230 --> 34:04.626
University of Texas Board of Regents, so we 
cooperated in this research. What about the

34:05.939 --> 34:09.263
different schools in A&M? Are the new programs at 
the instigation of this little business that they

34:09.283 --> 34:15.752
can take? In some cases, I think so. Based upon Dr. 
Bill Mews' interest in bringing forth new

34:19.096 --> 34:34.697
opportunities for the professors in business 
administration, he, I think, got together with

34:19.096 --> 34:34.697
Skip Porter and decided give

34:35.318 --> 34:47.933
professors over there in economics and whatever 
management opportunities to participate. Where

34:47.953 --> 34:57.465
did he switch from what, and I'm not sure what the 
definition is, from technology research to high

34:47.953 --> 34:57.465
tech research? Is there a

34:57.485 --> 35:02.771
difference? There's not a difference. Like I mean 
it's a matter of definition. Like basic research

35:09.858 --> 35:12.103
is a matter of definition. What is basic research? 
What is applied research? Some of the research

35:16.371 --> 35:24.867
done over there in the Food Protein Research and 
Development Center using diverse osmosis,

35:26.467 --> 35:35.840
different types of membranes, separating 
proteins of various lengths of chains and that

35:26.467 --> 35:35.840
sort of thing. Well, it's applied, but you have to 
have some fundamental knowledge of what it is

35:35.860 --> 35:44.892
you're doing in order to make these membranes 
work. And they've come up with some separation

35:44.912 --> 35:51.761
processes now that are going to revolutionize the 
food industry. Whereas before we were throwing

35:51.781 --> 35:53.824
out a lot of it, of ways and stuff that she's making, 
we're going to save all that stuff. And that's

36:01.454 --> 36:10.703
going to cut down on the pollution requirements 
for waste treatment plants and save food stuff

36:01.454 --> 36:10.703
that makes the food industry more efficient. One 
of the researchers over in the food protein

36:10.723 --> 36:20.353
research in Melbourne now has a patent that's with 
the Japanese involved. And that's going to be very

36:20.373 --> 36:22.495
helpful to him So what's the

36:23.032 --> 36:33.303
difference between tech and high tech? Well, high 
technology right now is defined by many people as

36:33.323 --> 36:45.676
involving computers and solid state 
electronics. Solid state electronics involves

36:45.696 --> 36:51.182
an integrated circuit and making things smaller 
and smaller with larger and larger capacity. The

36:58.916 --> 37:07.907
larger and larger the capacity of one of these 
chips makes a computer that much more capable. And

37:07.927 --> 37:09.749
that's the high tech. But biotechnology has also 
got a high tech flavor. And in that case, they're

37:16.157 --> 37:21.203
taking cloning

37:22.651 --> 37:29.999
cloning some of the DNA and the bio-chains and the 
genes are being split and put back together.

37:30.139 --> 37:39.610
Things are just getting,

37:30.139 --> 37:39.610
just getting, I think, solid. It's just really 
another term for progress. I think so. I think, you

37:42.954 --> 37:45.877
know, we had an information explosion many years 
ago. We still got information. Technology

37:49.161 --> 37:52.084
transfer is still one of our goals. problems

37:52.756 --> 38:09.317
and racism, I'd say.

38:12.441 --> 38:14.724
Dissemination of information adopted by the 
industries in Texas or other nations making a more

38:12.441 --> 38:14.724
competitive agenda. When you were involved in the 
case in the 70s, how did you go about it? What were

38:16.186 --> 38:17.328
cheese methods of disseminating information? We 
had the and

38:18.288 --> 38:34.137
then

38:18.288 --> 38:34.137
Windows replaced that and put it in a new format and 
hired some new people and

38:34.117 --> 38:44.577
some quality

38:34.117 --> 38:44.577
writers and some artists who really have made it in 
the first class. One of the shortfalls, I think, of

38:44.597 --> 38:56.580
our publications is that we are not real sure of our 
dissemination list or who to send it to. People in

38:57.320 --> 39:08.441
important places who should get it change all

38:57.320 --> 39:08.441
the time, every time. Organizations change. And 
it's darn difficult to keep up with it. I have the

39:12.288 --> 39:16.593
same problem over here. We were sending out close 
to 10,000 copies of our Texas Energy newsletter

39:18.034 --> 39:28.927
that was published 10 times a year, and now it's 
published six times a year. And we purged the list

39:28.947 --> 39:37.877
and started all over, and it went down to 3,500, and 
now we're back up to 1,500. People read it.

39:41.971 --> 39:50.884
Who

39:41.971 --> 39:50.884
would you be? Are you sending out to industry and 
any other? Industry, other schools,

39:58.214 --> 40:05.084
other researchers. University of Texas sent us a 
copy of . We try to outdo each other, and there's

40:05.905 --> 40:08.609
nothing wrong with competition. The remote 
sensing system was established in 68. Is that part

40:11.097 --> 40:17.964
of the space technology mission? It was a separate 
center, but a close connection . Now I understand

40:28.615 --> 40:38.866
that we're going to sort of change the purpose of 
remote sensing. And I have not had anything to do

40:38.886 --> 40:40.328
with this. I'm against it. I

40:40.915 --> 41:05.163
believe

40:40.915 --> 41:05.163
the remote sensing potential is only going to be 
scratched. We will be doing many, many more things

41:05.183 --> 41:09.127
with remote sensing information, whether it be 
manufacturing processes, looking at Earth from

41:05.183 --> 41:09.127
space, looking at space from Earth, or whatever. 
But it's now going to have the flavor of high tech,

41:09.147 --> 41:10.669
high level technologies. It's

41:11.408 --> 41:30.868
going to be more

41:11.408 --> 41:30.868
centered than I like to call it. Fantastic. 
Agriculture, using remote sensing, just since

41:31.108 --> 41:35.593
the soil moisture content in agriculture, the 
count of heat fields in the room, and since the

41:31.108 --> 41:35.593
condition of our guys.

41:39.117 --> 41:57.548
Yeah.

41:58.709 --> 42:17.155
Well,

41:58.709 --> 42:17.155
they just made the

41:58.709 --> 42:17.155
decision to take it out of the law firm. So they used 
to ask us to do that. $50,000 contract, I think it

42:21.481 --> 42:24.345
was. that we had

42:26.688 --> 42:38.883
was the first project. And then closed because

42:38.903 --> 42:45.391
the emphasis was all on supersonic flight. 
Low-speed vehicles were not needed. And all of a

42:49.736 --> 42:52.780
sudden, they are being used and are needed for 
testing offshore platforms. Surface effect

42:53.738 --> 43:01.147
machines, and signs, and roof ventilators, and 
reunion towers for Dallas. Offshore

43:02.729 --> 43:17.486
drilling. All kinds of things. There's a lot of 
activity out there. General aviation. You

43:20.975 --> 43:41.746
know, the ones that build the executive jets and 
the two-engine planes and things are not mobile.

43:41.766 --> 43:43.508
We're trying to improve performance, improve 
energy efficiency, and that sort of thing. And the

43:43.528 --> 43:44.950
one kind of thing we're aiming for in the grad 
program is that. What about the nuclear science?

43:45.611 --> 43:46.813
You know, when we came to Cybertron, we just 
couldn't do it.

43:50.135 --> 44:12.918
Nuclear

43:50.135 --> 44:12.918
Science Center is disappointing

43:50.135 --> 44:12.918
because I tried to get them more involved in 
research. I think there's a real need for more

44:12.938 --> 44:16.041
research involving tracers. We use the tracers 
for studying corrosion. You can

44:17.523 --> 44:41.412
oil

44:17.523 --> 44:41.412
field

44:17.523 --> 44:41.412
production and sour gas fields, sour gases and . 
And you can measure the rate of decomposition of

44:41.432 --> 44:45.957
the production pumps and the drills and things 
down the hole if you use your science center

44:41.432 --> 44:45.957
tracers. And also you can use neutrons to Neutron 
radiography

44:47.054 --> 45:08.878
is

44:47.054 --> 45:08.878
a way of detecting flaws in composite materials 
that are fake due to other extrovert techniques.

45:08.898 --> 45:10.580
So neutron radiography is a very important thing. 
More research into the problem. But at the center

45:11.241 --> 45:13.483
right now, we're just having problems with the 
Cauch-Kofstra. and

45:13.852 --> 45:36.706
they have

45:13.852 --> 45:36.706
not aggressively gone out into the city, outside. 
I'm not going to be involved in the city at all, but

45:36.726 --> 45:41.293
right now it looks like the Richard Sons Center 
would like to go as a part of the university because

45:36.726 --> 45:41.293
they feel like they would be better received as far 
as paying their bills.

45:44.362 --> 45:48.280
The T's is operating on the philosophy that people 
should pay attention to.
