WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:07.118
This

00:02.613 --> 00:07.118
is great. So, okay, okay. Now, targets in Laos. 
Now, generally speaking, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, we

00:12.163 --> 00:23.635
got to the point where we operated so much, we 
didn't know just about where it was, but you know,

00:12.163 --> 00:23.635
the Ho Chi Minh Trail was like ants passing through 
your lawn. You stop them up one direction, they

00:24.236 --> 00:29.802
move over a hundred feet and go through the jungle 
and establish another one. Nobody can really

00:31.250 --> 00:42.583
understand this capability of the Viet Cong in 
getting supplies down that Ho Chi Minh Trail from

00:31.250 --> 00:42.583
North Vietnam to South Vietnam until they've 
actually seen it. Then you can understand it. It's

00:44.646 --> 00:50.272
almost unbelievable for me to describe it and for 
you to believe that there's no reason why we

00:44.646 --> 00:50.272
couldn't stop these supplies. But when men have an 
A-frame on their back and will carry

00:55.685 --> 01:04.082
hundred-pound loads on their back and walk 
through the jungle under complete canopy, which

00:55.685 --> 01:04.082
you can't even penetrate with film, then maybe you 
understand. And they walked all the way.

01:07.048 --> 01:09.754
Bicycles, they'd ride bicycles there. If I'm 
getting off the subject. We knew generally where

01:11.678 --> 01:16.528
these routes were, and at night they felt they were 
free to down the usual trail, because nobody could

01:17.015 --> 01:19.198
see them. Well, of course, this stopped when we got 
the gunship capability over there that had the

01:19.238 --> 01:27.147
night vision for the infrared flare, which would 
go by Texas Institute. And again, I was very proud

01:27.167 --> 01:32.694
of getting this introduced into the combat forces 
over there. But there were at times where we knew

01:33.995 --> 01:45.469
there were concentrations of supplies, you know, 
and relays to go from one day and one night, then

01:33.995 --> 01:45.469
stop, then the next night they'd go another maybe 
10 or 12 miles and they'd stop and always move at

01:45.905 --> 02:14.781
night we you know eventually find these 
concentrations and it always turned out that

01:45.905 --> 02:14.781
wherever these concentrations were sure enough 
there'd be some AA defense from them operated by

01:45.905 --> 02:14.781
Pathet Laos now this up down Laos because they knew 
if we found them we're going to hit them well

01:45.905 --> 02:14.781
they're going to start trying to protect them with 
AA and eventually got to be very capable so it built

01:45.905 --> 02:14.781
radar directed AA in Laos This is not very well 
known. But these targets had to be hit, and this was

02:17.503 --> 02:21.767
General Mulmire's responsibility. He had to- one 
of the basic doctors of air force, of course, air

02:21.787 --> 02:31.437
tactics, you've got to hit them in the supply area 
where it hurts the top supply. Interdiction, if

02:31.978 --> 02:33.319
you will. Tactical air warfare. Now, did he have 
authority to hit these targets? Well, he had to

02:38.384 --> 02:45.291
properly identify them and get permission from 
Ambassador Sullivan's to hit these targets.

02:51.052 --> 02:55.418
It required communications that had made things 
more complex and halted. It hindered operations,

02:55.639 --> 02:59.364
but it worked. But when these particular targets 
might, let's say, be near a, let's say, a habitated

03:01.206 --> 03:11.160
center, I call it an inhabited center, a town, if 
you will, in Laos, which, if you bomb there, it

03:11.596 --> 03:15.179
maybe hits civilians. And this is where the 
problems came up. This was forbidden, absolutely

03:16.981 --> 03:20.163
forbidden. You cannot hit certain targets in 
Laos. Well, in warfare, sometimes, you know, it's

03:23.446 --> 03:27.290
difficult. Particularly in the jungle of the 
southeast states, it's hard to identify targets

03:27.450 --> 03:31.553
at best. But sometimes mistakes were made. And 
we'd hit targets, and we'd kill civilians. And

03:37.058 --> 03:41.502
this was when the fire would fly between Ambrose 
Sullivan and Seventh Air Force. And again, this

03:43.018 --> 03:49.509
was a matter of refereeing and arbitration, where 
I came into picture. A lot of cases where nothing

03:49.529 --> 04:00.287
were but saving people's feelings, and 
Ambassador Sullivan was well aware of the

03:49.529 --> 04:00.287
difficulties we had in those places. What were 
some of these places that you were hitting, and do

04:00.427 --> 04:06.477
you remember any of the major accidents, so to 
speak? No, just a matter of fact, at night, a

04:06.794 --> 04:17.687
bomber, a fighter bomber, misidentifying the 
target, or maybe even missing the target, and

04:06.794 --> 04:17.687
screwing his bomb across the city. 
Understandable era, definitely not

04:18.768 --> 04:26.538
intentional, but generally that's what it was. I 
don't remember any gross eras like hitting a dam.

04:32.123 --> 04:33.124
That never did come. What were some of the, what 
about the targets? Did you ever get any of these

04:35.427 --> 04:38.690
Russian installations? Russian? No, did you ever 
get any of these installations? I thought you said

04:42.254 --> 04:43.676
they had some AA. Oh, yes, as a matter of fact. You 
said in Laos. Oh, yeah, we lost airplanes in Laos.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.464
Okay, did you ever, those were targeted, weren't 
they? Yeah. Were they knocked down? We had

04:52.605 --> 04:54.768
airplanes knocked down by AA fire in Laos. As a 
matter of fact, one of the One of the most dangerous

04:57.065 --> 05:05.956
and difficult targets for pilots, and boy, they 
thought twice when they were trying to hit that

04:57.065 --> 05:05.956
target, was a pass. I forget the name of it, but it 
was just in the southeast, southwestern corner of

05:05.976 --> 05:26.242
North Vietnam across the mountains into Laos, 
just at, you might say, the point where North

05:05.976 --> 05:26.242
Vietnam and South Vietnam came together at the 
demilitarized zone. Yeah. where Laos was on the

05:26.731 --> 05:30.518
western border of both of them. There was a pass 
through there, a mountain pass. And this was, you

05:33.443 --> 05:40.515
know, the pass normally is where most of the roads 
are in transportation nationally. So that's

05:40.535 --> 05:42.719
where the Ho Chi Minh Trail went through there. And 
we knew there were foreign supplies through

05:42.759 --> 05:44.562
there. And it got where we started hitting them. 
Well, the more we struck it, the more they put AA

05:46.927 --> 05:50.072
defenses there. The more we drank it, the more they 
put better AA defenses in there. Finally, they got

05:53.746 --> 05:56.689
these radar-controlled defenses. Boy, it was a 
tough target. It was almost like going against a

05:58.170 --> 06:00.953
barrel of a cannon. To my knowledge, I don't ever 
remember a missile as such, a SAM, ever being

06:02.555 --> 06:08.962
deployed in Laos. I don't think the Russians would 
permit the North Vietnamese to do it. But they got

06:13.907 --> 06:18.692
radar-controlled AA weapons.

06:19.482 --> 06:20.784
and we lost airplanes. And I don't ever remember us 
losing an airplane over Laos to a MiG. The MiGs in

06:26.612 --> 06:35.866
North Vietnam, they very, very seldom would ever 
fly over into Thailand, or Laos. And I don't ever

06:35.886 --> 06:42.115
remember a MiG coming into South Vietnam.

06:43.850 --> 06:46.034
And maybe their rules were different. I don't 
know. Now I do remember we lost a C-47 in northern

06:47.376 --> 06:55.029
stretches of Laos. We had strayed and got off 
course and got too close to the North Vietnam

06:56.111 --> 07:00.799
border. It may have actually been within North 
Vietnam and it was intercepted by a MiG and shot

07:00.819 --> 07:06.889
down. We know this by the pilot calling in and 
saying, I'm being attacked. We lost the airplane

07:12.315 --> 07:14.958
with all the people on it. Was he killed, or did he 
ever come back? Was he killed? The whole crew was

07:19.483 --> 07:21.725
killed. Everybody aboard. No one bailed out? They 
were shot down. That was one of the roads through

07:28.733 --> 07:31.616
the air. Yeah. Okay. Now, how Tell me about, you 
said you had a few Air American people on your base.

07:41.770 --> 07:44.013
On the Thai Air Base. Yeah. In fact, I was there too, 
but this was on the Thai Air Base. Exactly, but I

07:48.981 --> 07:53.848
know at Udorn. What about, did you meet any of these 
people? Oh, yeah. I ate dinner with them many,

07:59.551 --> 08:07.321
matter of fact, they had such a terrific mess on 
Sunday, I always went over and had dinner at their

07:59.551 --> 08:07.321
mess hall on Sunday. No kidding. Fantastic. You 
had good relations with them. As a matter of fact,

08:11.106 --> 08:17.654
you see this carried me back to my earlier days as a 
member of the Flying Tigers. Sure, because they

08:17.674 --> 08:21.079
were in a sense a similar outfit, weren't they? 
Exactly. They had what was called, incidentally,

08:23.422 --> 08:28.528
they did better than we did though, financial 
wise, they had what they called a $100,000 club.

08:33.909 --> 08:38.214
See, this outfit had been over a long, long time 
before we got in the war. And they were paid

08:38.554 --> 08:41.898
terrific salaries. Do you remember what it was, 
how much you were paid? No, I don't, but $100,000

08:44.922 --> 08:50.408
club was a man who became a member of it when he had 
earned $100,000. And I know some of them have been

08:52.451 --> 08:55.154
over a few years. In one year? Oh, no, no, no. Two or 
three years. Two or three years they could make

08:57.979 --> 09:00.220
$100,000? By various means. This wasn't all paid. 
Were they former Air Force pilots, most of them?

09:09.749 --> 09:11.470
Yeah, some of them were. Half of them, would you 
say? I don't know. I don't know that much about the

09:13.332 --> 09:17.455
exact organization. I'd say they had about, they 
must have had about always a total of at least six or

09:17.615 --> 09:25.262
eight helicopters. Sometimes, see, they had them 
across the river at the airport at Ben 10. But their

09:30.984 --> 09:39.955
main maintenance base and major supply and 
maintenance, if you will, depot level was right

09:30.984 --> 09:39.955
there on the base of Udorn. They had two or three 
C-123s, and they must have had, or they had to have

09:41.577 --> 09:52.190
at least 150 people. A hundred and fifty at Udorn? 
It's a big operation. Between Udorn and

09:55.810 --> 09:57.191
Vientiane. It's a big operation. Oh, are you 
kidding? Of course. Well, now that doesn't

10:00.394 --> 10:13.867
include the big supply base they had down at 
Tocqueville where they actually stored and

10:00.394 --> 10:13.867
eventually had a supply operation, I mean a supply 
storage space right there at my base at Udorn. I had

10:13.887 --> 10:15.989
to provide an extra ramp. We actually built it for 
them. An extra ramp and hangar, well if you will, a

10:18.331 --> 10:23.616
supply warehouse where they stored their their 
bombs and their what they called A packages of rice

10:24.592 --> 10:38.748
and clothing, medicine. Were they all American 
citizens or were there some foreigners? No, no,

10:41.411 --> 10:45.535
all Americans.

10:45.555 --> 10:52.303
Some Laotian and some Thais.

10:54.764 --> 11:06.358
I might even enlighten you on even another type of 
operation that's probably very, very little

10:54.764 --> 11:06.358
known. I actually got involved in coordination, 
and you can imagine the people involved, between

11:07.059 --> 11:24.400
the Thais, the Laotians, the two ambassadors, and 
Air America, and and me, of moving some Thai army

11:25.679 --> 11:31.588
artillery over into Laos to actually help them in 
their fighting. Man by ties. Really?

11:37.156 --> 11:38.999
And you transported them up there? Or did Air 
American transport them? Air American

11:39.940 --> 11:41.923
transported them. How many went up there? Oh, it 
was a very small operation. Just so you might know,

11:45.588 --> 11:52.058
they had detachment with maybe two or three pieces 
of artillery. How effective it was, I don't know. I

11:55.490 --> 11:56.952
didn't. Did they go up there to train LAO's? Oh no, 
they fight well. Fight for them. Probably went up

12:02.419 --> 12:05.502
to train them, but that meant fighting too. This 
was when the General Mao, M-E-O, and his, see there

12:05.763 --> 12:15.454
were good Pathet Maos and bad Pathet Laos. He was 
the good Pathet Lao. When he was being hard pressed

12:18.758 --> 12:22.483
and pushed back south, towards Vientiane by the 
North Vietnamese and Northeastern Laos in a

12:22.987 --> 12:31.975
determined effort to wipe him out. The North 
Vietnamese decided to eliminate him. He was a very

12:35.718 --> 12:45.767
effective little

12:35.718 --> 12:45.767
ragtag force, if you will, and completely 
supported by the CIA. And when he was being pushed

12:45.788 --> 12:51.913
and needed some support, well, the Thais tried to 
help. Well, that's the type of thing, one of the

12:53.733 --> 12:57.379
types of things I got involved in. The Thais were, 
they were afraid of the North Vietnamese. Oh,

13:00.564 --> 13:01.445
yeah. In fact, this, when I mentioned 
insurrectionists in northern Thailand, it was

13:01.465 --> 13:13.184
obvious a lot of them were North Vietnamese. Or, if 
you will, Thailand

13:19.771 --> 13:39.941
What, North Vietnamese refugees had come down 
into northern Thailand and then were subverted

13:19.771 --> 13:39.941
and trained and then sent back, you know, got back 
to North Vietnam, then were trained and paid

13:19.771 --> 13:39.941
accordingly, and then stepped back into North 
Thailand as a, really as a North Vietnamese agent.

13:39.961 --> 13:41.724
It got awful sticky and complicated.

13:45.409 --> 13:48.073
But as I say, it was extremely interesting. No 
kidding. Now, when Thailand sent these artillery

13:50.710 --> 14:00.423
men over, and the two or three pieces of artillery, 
did they dress them in Laotian uniforms?

14:07.693 --> 14:12.820
I don't remember, but I do know this, that I doubt 
it. I got an idea that they had just, if you will, the

14:12.980 --> 14:16.845
black uniform on. Maybe it wasn't. It may have been 
just black pajamas. The term black I use, as a

14:21.530 --> 14:26.657
matter of fact, that defines this type of an 
operation. It's a black operation. This is the CIA

14:28.218 --> 14:29.680
term. In other words, unknown, you can't see it, or 
words of that effect. But I remember it, and we

14:33.505 --> 14:42.375
often laugh about it on my staff, C-123 would come 
in some night at Udorn. No markings on it

14:43.937 --> 14:46.140
whatsoever, not even any numbers. No markings on 
it whatsoever. Painted black. The plane was

14:50.342 --> 14:51.283
painted black? Painted black. And land. And we 
always grabbed a lot of little bitty men that all of

14:54.947 --> 15:12.306
a sudden flow out of this thing, an Air America 
vehicle, pick them all up, put them in this truck,

14:54.947 --> 15:12.306
close the end of the truck with the curtain, and 
take them off to a special barracks. It was not part

15:12.947 --> 15:15.790
of my responsibility on the Udorn Air Base, and 
close the doors. And you go by there in daytime,

15:21.924 --> 15:28.332
you'd never see anybody, and you wouldn't even 
know what's going on. But the following night,

15:28.352 --> 15:42.170
about midnight, a truck come up, all these little 
piece of men would get out and get in this truck, and

15:28.352 --> 15:42.170
the truck would run up to this airplane, this black 
airplane for it, and it would open up, and they'd

15:28.352 --> 15:42.170
get in the back of this and see it's an airlift like 
the airplane. Sure. And I'm talking about thirty

15:43.331 --> 15:44.933
or forty people. All these little bitty men would 
get in there and they, you know at night they looked

15:45.352 --> 15:48.995
black. How they were dressed we don't know. God 
knows they were probably dressed in typical

15:51.438 --> 16:03.369
civilian garb of the

15:51.438 --> 16:03.369
Laotian countrymen or peasants living in the 
jungle. That's probably the way they were

16:03.409 --> 16:05.851
dressed. And then this airplane had planned upon 
running me to take off and head over into the

16:05.871 --> 16:12.017
lounge. You didn't know who they were? Did you ever 
find out anything? Did you ever ask? Oh, yeah. We,

16:17.946 --> 16:31.323
at times, various times, get sufficient answers 
to know that these were special paid and special

16:17.946 --> 16:31.323
trained jungle warfare people by the CIA. And some 
of them were actually laid on by General

16:31.844 --> 16:42.477
Westmoreland's command down in Saigon. to be 
carried over into the Laotian area and

16:42.828 --> 16:57.244
some landing zone, as we called it, a big enough 
area where the airplane could land and let them get

16:42.828 --> 16:57.244
out. And then by their training and all, they, 
coming from that area, they knew exactly the

16:57.344 --> 17:03.651
countryside. And then they would station 
themselves along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and

17:03.691 --> 17:09.898
actually report back in some cases by radio, and in 
some cases by just recording information and

17:10.672 --> 17:27.333
maintaining data, and then being picked up, let's 
say, three nights later on the flow of supplies

17:10.672 --> 17:27.333
down. And sometimes, actually, the instructions 
to lay on ambushes and kill North Vietnamese

17:27.353 --> 17:37.886
coming down North Vietnam, this type of 
operation. A lot of this went on. A lot of it. How

17:41.030 --> 17:53.344
free were the Air America people in discussing 
these

17:41.030 --> 17:53.344
actions with you when you went over there on Sunday 
and had a brunch with them? They were very

17:53.424 --> 17:55.826
well-trained in this area. They didn't talk about 
it. They were unusually well-trained. And I knew

18:00.211 --> 18:03.535
better than to ask the question, quite frankly. 
They'd talk about some of the resupply missions in

18:04.596 --> 18:07.299
the area. I'd go up to LZ-2, Leningrad 2, and stuff 
off some rice. They'd talk about things like that.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.542
That was why they'd be shot at. Boy, I got a bullet 
hole today. They lost a few pilots and

18:22.267 --> 18:27.753
helicopters. Again, it carried me back to my 
experience. And if they were supplying someplace

18:29.575 --> 18:35.742
and they were shot down, and they were captured, 
What would they do? Would they say they were

18:37.869 --> 18:39.411
American citizens? What kind of papers would they 
have on them? Did you ever find out? No, I don't

18:43.455 --> 18:45.638
think they were carrying papers on them. I'm sure a 
lot of the... I'll tell you what, I'll bet you some

18:48.701 --> 18:50.883
would think about it. I imagine a lot of the 
experience in their operations

18:51.544 --> 19:01.715
probably was copied from some of our experience in 
Flying Tigers. I don't remember them carrying any

19:01.735 --> 19:05.880
identification on their back like we did. as part 
of the, in other words, as part of the Laotian Air

19:06.383 --> 19:11.310
Force. I don't know of any occasions where one of 
them was captured. I don't ever remember this

19:13.994 --> 19:16.557
being brought up. I know some were killed. Yeah, 
they were shot down there. I got an idea that one of

19:22.185 --> 19:26.130
them was captured. He was probably shot. I don't 
know. And that's the reason they were high paid.

19:32.659 --> 19:33.160
They knew that. They definitely were flying at me. 
As a matter of fact, I had to coordinate a mission

19:35.948 --> 19:50.746
one time where actually we flew aircraft over and 
provided air cover for one of their operations

19:35.948 --> 19:50.746
that was so close to the front of the North Vietnam 
in Laos. You know, sometimes we did get in air

19:51.848 --> 19:56.033
support with them. But that was unusual. What kind 
of mission was that? It was a resupply, but they had

20:00.987 --> 20:14.841
to drop supplies to General Miles' forces so close 
to where the fighting front, if you will, between

20:00.987 --> 20:14.841
the North Vietnamese that they were apt to be fired 
at by the North Vietnamese and shot down. So you

20:15.162 --> 20:16.783
sent a couple of jets over there. Yeah, to 
suppress. And just the appearance of the jets

20:19.106 --> 20:25.092
alone would keep the North Vietnamese from 
firing. This happened two or three times. And

20:28.517 --> 20:56.023
actually, we, in coordination through my control 
center between Ambassador Sullivan's control

20:28.517 --> 20:56.023
center in Laos and General Mulminer's 
headquarters, we actually laid on some strike

20:28.517 --> 20:56.023
missions with my F-4s and F-105s and Thailand 
bases against the North Vietnamese when they were

20:28.517 --> 20:56.023
really swarming down against the Laotians when 
they were approaching the capital of Vientiane.

20:56.577 --> 20:59.882
at Ambassador Sullivan's request. That's one 
time Ambassador Sullivan got in bed with General

20:59.902 --> 21:03.126
Martin. He needed his support. And the provided 
one. This was a war that was very little

21:09.175 --> 21:13.081
publicized. Oh, absolutely. Very little 
publicized. Not until the Pentagon gave us, did

21:16.306 --> 21:17.988
you? Okay, well, we're doing a great job here. So 
the Air America people, you had a have a good sized

21:24.404 --> 21:26.788
contingency of them. I'm surprised at the 
numbers. Well, I may be overestimated, but it's

21:28.852 --> 21:32.758
bound to be that many total. OK.

21:33.981 --> 21:49.888
Now let's turn to the Special Forces Air Force 
group. Tell me about their capabilities. You

21:53.063 --> 21:55.445
mentioned before that you thought they were 
outstanding. This was the OB-26 twin engine,

21:56.986 --> 22:20.567
basically a light bomber, attack type aircraft, 
and little AT-6, I believe that's what they were

21:56.986 --> 22:20.567
called, T-26, T-26, T-26, trainer 26 aircraft, 
little single engine It's really a trainer

22:21.037 --> 22:26.023
airplane. It could

22:26.063 --> 22:31.790
carry two 250-pound bombs, something like that. 
It had guns in it, but when we give these type of

22:31.830 --> 22:45.446
aircraft to Thailand or to Laos or to South 
Vietnamese, they'd put guns on it, use it as an

22:31.830 --> 22:45.446
attack airplane, a fighter. But, you know, 
definitely was not comparable to modern fighter.

22:51.783 --> 22:58.591
But they were slow, relatively slow compared to 
jet aircraft. They could fly at night, just like an

22:59.973 --> 23:02.276
airplane. But being slower, you

23:03.097 --> 23:20.558
had greater time to identify a target and greater 
maneuverability to attack it and say, less room

23:03.097 --> 23:20.558
for error. I mean, much more room and latitude for 
making an error and being able to correct your

23:21.112 --> 23:29.403
position in order to actually put a bomb on a 
target. This is a controversial thing and was, and

23:30.104 --> 23:35.512
to a certain extent still is, in the Air Force. Do 
you want a slow aircraft to provide ground air

23:35.532 --> 23:50.612
support, or do you want and need a modern jet, a 
high-speed jet, to provide close air support and

23:35.532 --> 23:50.612
ground attack? it uh some people say it's 
controversial in uh in real high threat warfare

23:51.959 --> 24:19.755
you definitely have to have the high-speed jet 
otherwise you wouldn't live you'd be shut down now

23:51.959 --> 24:19.755
in a jungle warfare and particularly over there 
where you don't have a high defense to go against

23:51.959 --> 24:19.755
then this light airplane is much better and that's 
the reason we had some special forces in thailand

23:51.959 --> 24:19.755
in a certain area and that's the reason they were 
employed in that particular area. We didn't

24:22.163 --> 24:28.871
expect the North Vietnamese ever to get any 
sophisticated anti-aircraft down the Ho Chi Minh

24:22.163 --> 24:28.871
Trail. That's where these special forces drove 
them. That's right. See, that's the reason they

24:33.697 --> 24:35.179
were assigned there. So this doesn't, you have to 
understand all this. Some decisions you think

24:39.645 --> 24:45.011
might be idiotic and you don't understand them, 
but really this was a sound decision. The only

24:45.031 --> 24:49.557
thing that Momar got teed off about, TWD, was that 
He

24:50.026 --> 24:54.251
wanted modern forces. He didn't want any kind of an 
airplane over there except a jet aircraft. And he

24:59.317 --> 25:08.728
wanted, of course, he wanted primarily to knock 
out the supply sewers. In other words, hit North

25:08.768 --> 25:10.550
Vietnam. The way we should have done it, anyhow. 
But here, part of his forces using up one of his base

25:12.472 --> 25:17.859
was these little top-driven aircraft. Bomar 
strenuously objected to it. But Ambassador

25:20.941 --> 25:31.359
Sullivan, having, you know, a certain authority 
and responsibility in Laos, obviously

25:20.941 --> 25:31.359
overruled, so we got the Air Force forces there. 
Well, now what's the capability? At night, and

25:35.466 --> 25:46.105
particularly on moonlight night, in this little 
slow T-26 with a cup of 250 pound bomb, and with guns

25:35.466 --> 25:46.105
on it, 30 caliber guns,

25:48.093 --> 25:54.563
against open targets, let's say a truck that you 
could see on a moonlight night and didn't have any

25:48.093 --> 25:54.563
tree cover. Gee, this was our plan perfect to knock 
it out, and they got trucks. The B-26, which had a

25:59.530 --> 26:10.907
much greater bomb capability and many more guns on 
it, it had a much greater capability than the T-26,

25:59.530 --> 26:10.907
and it did a good job. And our daily truck count, 
which we had every morning, debriefings, you

26:11.508 --> 26:17.357
know, stand-up briefings, what we do last night, 
These little forces always had some truck kills,

26:17.827 --> 26:27.398
or maybe an anti-aircraft site suppression. They 
actually attacked and destroyed the state

26:27.458 --> 26:31.042
government. Whereas the F-4s based at Ubon that 
were special trained for night bombing missions

26:32.164 --> 26:42.636
along the I remember talking to some pilots that 
flew that aircraft on that type of mission, and

26:44.084 --> 26:50.390
boy, it was a hairy operation at night. Also- They 
could hear you coming to them. Well, no more than

26:55.175 --> 26:58.078
you could hear the T-26 coming. But so, I mean, they 
get from the ground, the North Vietnamese could

26:58.098 --> 27:11.111
hear this airplane flying so slowly that they 
could probably have, what, a few seconds warning

26:58.098 --> 27:11.111
that this bomber's coming? Well, or is that- Now, 
more sight, seeing one, than hearing. The hearing

27:18.807 --> 27:23.674
was not that much different, but the sight of 
seeing it, you know. But at night they wouldn't see

27:23.694 --> 27:24.875
it. No, at night. But then, of course, you blew your 
lights, running lights off. Sure. But operating

27:30.182 --> 27:43.200
an F-4 and trying to find your target at a high speed 
and then at a higher altitude and making the diving

27:30.182 --> 27:43.200
pass and then recovering at night and, you know, 
whether it's moonlight night or not, you had to go.

27:43.552 --> 27:49.881
Boy, this was like flying in a,

27:43.552 --> 27:49.881
well, it was difficult. Difficult task, and kind 
of hairy, and it took special training. But they

27:54.909 --> 28:10.572
killed trucks, but none of them were as effective 
as what we called a gunship, a C-130, specially

27:54.909 --> 28:10.572
equipped, that we eventually got into the base at 
Ubon, and they were given a primary mission. of

28:10.855 --> 28:13.018
operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Now this 
was a very effective— Tell me about this one. This

28:17.543 --> 28:25.793
is a normal C-130 four-engine turboprop 
transport that you've seen with Transport Truth.

28:26.534 --> 28:32.100
It was manned with side firing out the side of the 
fuselage.

28:36.205 --> 28:38.668
Automatic turret-type machine gun operations 
with 20 millimeter, and we eventually even

28:39.425 --> 28:51.538
experimented with putting as high as a cannon, 
what we called a cannon, 75 millimeter. Wow. How

28:53.980 --> 28:54.801
did that work? We experimented with it at Eglin, 
but it didn't get an operation for a while. I wasn't

28:58.605 --> 29:02.289
over there whether it ever got an operation. 
Didn't that stress on the client? recall was

29:07.235 --> 29:12.422
automatically taken care of by suppression of 
recall. But this was a very effective 50 caliber,

29:12.462 --> 29:29.224
20 millimeter gun firing, you know, and special 
maneuver that the airplane would go into and

29:12.462 --> 29:29.224
actually trace the fire, you know, the pilot would 
fly the airplane when he'd locate the truck. It was

29:29.344 --> 29:30.946
clear before looking in for red. And 
coordination, you'd be really on your toes and

29:37.002 --> 29:59.383
just absolutely enthralled to hear a tape 
recording of the coordination by radio teletype,

29:37.002 --> 29:59.383
I mean radio telegraphy, you know, earphones, and 
transmitting the aircraft between the pilot

29:37.002 --> 29:59.383
flying the airplane and the gunner back there, and 
a coordination between all of them. And let's say

29:59.403 --> 30:03.887
the scanner's looking out, you know, by just 
looking out the side of the airplane. and

30:04.407 --> 30:27.938
protected the guy, let's say watching the FLIR, 
before looking at the red display where the truck

30:04.407 --> 30:27.938
was, in this turning maneuver, and then firing on 
these trucks at night, and also taking pictures of

30:04.407 --> 30:27.938
them, of the FLIR presentation, you know, on 
another scope, and seeing the truck explode. It

30:29.200 --> 30:31.883
was absolutely It's amazing to watch this 
operation. Extremely effective. And boy, I tell

30:35.106 --> 30:38.811
you, those were effective operations. But a 
gunship put out just thousands of rounds per

30:40.352 --> 30:47.181
second. Now, I'm telling you so many things that I 
may be getting my nomenclature mixed up. But I'll

30:52.348 --> 31:01.279
try to get all this straightened out about the 
caliber, the size, and the types, the name, and

30:52.348 --> 31:01.279
all, when I go through these.

31:01.630 --> 31:03.593
Well, you used the gunships then. Yes, and they 
were fragged by John Wilmer, 7th Air Force. All of

31:06.377 --> 31:07.698
them were based as a unit. We had about, I think we 
had a unit of about six of them at Ubon, Thailand,

31:07.799 --> 31:14.508
right near Littleson border.

31:21.438 --> 31:22.940
Gunships. Okay. Now, let me add this. As a result of 
this type of operation, particularly the Special

31:27.652 --> 31:34.600
Forces people, you know, who dedicated their 
mission— They didn't fly gunships, did they? No,

31:34.640 --> 31:35.662
no, no, no. But Special Forces people wanted it 
because, boy, that was an advanced weapon, and

31:35.702 --> 31:40.387
that's right down their alley, see. But this was 
sort of a new innovation in tactical warfare. As a

31:45.353 --> 31:52.562
matter of fact, General Lohmeyer monitored this 
very carefully personally, and it turned out to be

31:45.353 --> 31:52.562
very effective. And even some of the people, you 
know, said, gee, we ought to have this thing in

31:53.352 --> 32:00.840
Europe, you know, with such effective operations 
against ground forces. That thing would not live

32:00.860 --> 32:06.866
in a classical air battle area. It'd be shot down 
and nothing left. Oh, yeah, it had no defense. But

32:11.531 --> 32:15.475
at nighttime, now, it'd be a little bit different 
operation. But in my opinion, that thing would

32:15.495 --> 32:23.123
have no place in the classical war in Europe. But in 
your opinion, the job that it did in jungle

32:23.491 --> 32:26.194
warfare? Terrific. Terrific. It's still a part of 
the Special Weapons Forces. It's still a part of

32:31.040 --> 32:37.828
Tactical Air Warfare Special Forces and TAC at 
Hurlburt Air Force in Florida. As a matter of fact,

32:37.848 --> 32:43.255
they're still improving it technologically. And 
I'm sure, I don't know this, but I'm sure they're

32:43.315 --> 32:50.283
still experimenting with higher caliber weapons 
than they should be. Okay.

32:53.528 --> 33:22.540
incidentally

32:53.528 --> 33:22.540
that airplane also can carry a laser marker and 
mark mark at night mark a target with the laser uh

32:53.528 --> 33:22.540
laser designator and the fighter flying with it 
can drop a bomb at night not ever even see the target

32:53.528 --> 33:22.540
but drop the bombs that work uh disclose 
coordination no but i mean how do they don't

33:23.178 --> 33:52.240
understand the technology behind this well the 
laser guide bomb on the fighter detects when it

33:23.178 --> 33:52.240
dropped if it's dropped in the envelope of the 
flying pattern between the in the area of the

33:23.178 --> 33:52.240
target on the ground where the laser designator 
it's a laser itself in the airplane marks a spot it

33:23.178 --> 33:52.240
puts a laser on this target let's say it's a let's 
say it's a truck he just shines his laser on the

33:23.178 --> 33:52.240
truck now the The laser emitter,

33:52.439 --> 34:01.828
the laser energy hitting a truck emits energy. The 
laser detector on the nose of the bomb, once it's

34:02.769 --> 34:10.877
dropped from the airplane, picks that up and hones 
on it. General S. Merlin said that this is the most

34:11.978 --> 34:16.582
technological war in American history. He would, 
right, matter of fact. Well, in history. Oh, yeah.

34:24.451 --> 34:25.813
He's absolutely right. I

34:25.933 --> 34:31.060
agree with him. OK. Now that we're on technology in 
Vietnam, are there other examples of new Air Force

34:31.200 --> 34:43.736
technology that's used besides a gunship and 
these small airplanes? And we talked about the

34:43.756 --> 34:47.862
laser bomb. Anything else? Oh, yeah, in the field 
of reconnaissance. Protectable electronics.

34:55.174 --> 35:20.209
Well, in electronic warfare, there were many new 
advancements

34:55.174 --> 35:20.209
in the technology of ECM, both detection, 
jamming, and jam-free type of equipment,

34:55.174 --> 35:20.209
guidance equipment. It was really a proving 
ground for the field of electronic,

35:21.235 --> 35:28.082
electromagnetic warfare. It was really a proving 
ground. Matter of fact, a lot of the things we

35:30.144 --> 35:38.173
learned over there are currently oriented to, you 
know, the universal warfare.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.340
We talked about the laser-guided bomb. 
Phenomenal, the rope.

35:51.273 --> 35:59.945
had its disadvantages compared to the new HARM, 
H-A-R-M weapon, in range, in particular speed.

36:01.647 --> 36:02.628
What is the HARM missile? The HARM is the same 
thing. It's an advanced strike. Both of them made

36:06.173 --> 36:06.894
it. Air-to-air? No, air-to-surface. For the same 
purpose. SAM suppression, if you will.

36:15.866 --> 36:17.008
Surface-to-air missile. And how does the HARM 
work? The same way the strike does. except it has a

36:19.825 --> 36:48.887
much greater capability has a longer range it's 
supersonic very fast and therefore more

36:19.825 --> 36:48.887
effective it has a greater capability to pick up 
electronic emissions in other words the sound

36:19.825 --> 36:48.887
sight it has

36:19.825 --> 36:48.887
well i'm talking about a modern weapon now i better 
keep my mouth shut We

36:50.960 --> 37:02.259
still have the harms in our arsenal, then.

37:02.339 --> 37:09.591
Okay, I wanted to ask if we had nuclear 
capabilities in Thailand. Actually employed and

37:10.252 --> 37:14.098
deployed horses, no. But you remember I mentioned 
B-52s? Sure. They were operating with,

37:18.250 --> 37:22.577
incidentally, carrying 50, 60 bombs. Sure.

37:25.681 --> 37:28.706
You know, B-52 was readily convertible to nuclear 
weapons. Oh, absolutely. There's no doubt that we

37:29.347 --> 37:40.643
could have, well, you know, we could introduce, we 
could have taken a B-52 off of the United States and

37:29.347 --> 37:40.643
dropped a nuclear weapon from the United States if 
we wanted to, if it was ever necessary. I don't know

37:41.028 --> 37:45.995
if we could operate them out with nuclear weapons 
or Mokinawa, couldn't we? Sure. So we didn't have

37:47.617 --> 37:50.061
them in Thailand. Or Navy carriers, I'm sure, had 
the Navy.

37:57.291 --> 38:01.617
Now you said that, I wanted to ask a question about 
insignias. When you were in the area, at Udorn, all

38:02.338 --> 38:08.807
your airplanes had American insignias on them.

38:12.162 --> 38:26.079
because the ranch hands who did the spraying and 
the defoliant, and I told you I knew a colonel, a

38:12.162 --> 38:26.079
lieutenant colonel who was one of the pilots of the 
ranch hands, they changed the insignias at will. I

38:26.480 --> 38:27.302
mean when they were They'd put Thai insignias on 
their airplanes, they'd put Laotian insignias,

38:27.687 --> 38:38.801
they'd put South Vietnamese insignias, and 
they'd always change depending on where they were

38:27.687 --> 38:38.801
going to spray. But you didn't ever change yours? 
Well, I never had defoliant portions in Thailand.

38:45.068 --> 38:49.694
They always operate out of South Vietnam. So you 
never had any dealings with the defoliant? No.

38:53.759 --> 38:55.281
Okay, you also said that naval air bomber strikes 
were a tough task, and I said we'd get back to that.

39:03.636 --> 39:06.079
Now tell me about that, naval air bomber strikes. 
Well, here again, you know, it's goals and

39:06.579 --> 39:17.750
missions, and basic rules of warfare, if you will, 
that are well known by experienced air warfare

39:06.579 --> 39:17.750
people. I mean, Navy and Air Force, and now, you 
know, some of the Army boys are operating aircraft

39:18.111 --> 39:26.719
of various types. But basic principle, and I think 
it's well accepted by everybody.

39:36.956 --> 39:37.677
I won't say that. It is not well accepted by 
everybody. That's the reason of the problem. But

39:41.883 --> 39:44.366
definitely the Air Force. Not accepted by the Navy 
now? Apparently

39:47.010 --> 39:50.575
not. Okay. What is it now? In any... war in 
particular a theater of operations a particular

39:57.209 --> 40:25.866
area where there's got to be joint operations of 
either two or more forces army air force army navy

39:57.209 --> 40:25.866
army navy and air force and let's say throw in a 
marine and let's say throw in the cia as i've been

39:57.209 --> 40:25.866
telling you about let's throw throw in a special 
weapon special forces which are part of the

39:57.209 --> 40:25.866
airport there's got to be one air commander Now, 
this is basic Air Force doctrine, and I agree with

40:26.690 --> 40:31.896
it 100%.

40:33.779 --> 40:36.462
If there was an advocate of this, it was little 
Spike Momar. He agreed with it, of course. Well,

40:39.966 --> 40:56.106
General Momar, being a very dedicated man to his 
job, and particularly Air Force, and probably, in

40:39.966 --> 40:56.106
my opinion, not probably, but it was, in my 
opinion, definitely, the best and most capable

40:56.761 --> 41:05.271
tactical Air Force general we had in the entire Air 
Force at the time he was assigned Seventh Air

40:56.761 --> 41:05.271
Force. As a matter of fact, that's the reason he was 
assigned Seventh Air Force. And I say this out of

41:09.636 --> 41:23.612
pure respect, not just because he's classmate of 
mine, and I like him, but he made an issue of this

41:09.636 --> 41:23.612
when he was given Seventh Air Force, that he wanted 
control of No, no. Texas moment with any air

41:25.421 --> 41:27.924
cadets, flying cadets. Oh, okay, okay. He

41:29.486 --> 41:47.490
decided to make an issue of this when he took over 
Stafford's Air Force, and I'd say he may have done

41:29.486 --> 41:47.490
it with the full permission of General McConnell, 
Chief of Staff of the Air Force.

41:51.571 --> 42:17.067
see the Navy was launching attacks and carriers at 
sea off sometimes very near the coast of North

41:51.571 --> 42:17.067
Vietnam, depends on where they were on other 
circumstances and so forth, and with their A6s, I

41:51.571 --> 42:17.067
believe that's what, A6, yeah, very capable 
airplane with a lot of ECM on it and capability of

41:51.571 --> 42:17.067
all weather strikes and night strikes easily, it 
had a capability.

42:18.849 --> 42:20.211
Now also they were in different geographic 
location, operating always from the ocean. And

42:24.972 --> 42:31.640
therefore, we're having less area to fly over, 
which might be defended by SAM missiles. Whereas

42:32.481 --> 42:39.610
the Air Force situation is a little bit different, 
and all of our forces being primarily against

42:32.481 --> 42:39.610
North Vietnam being operated in Thailand. Well, 
to launch all of these forces, and generally

42:42.196 --> 42:49.446
speaking, we tried to, it got down to a pattern 
where we almost would do it by the clock. It must

42:49.546 --> 42:53.312
have been easy for them. We'd make a strike in the 
morning and a strike in the afternoon with these

42:53.332 --> 43:03.086
fighters, and generally speaking, the Navy, 
generally speaking, would do the same thing. And

43:03.326 --> 43:06.390
then sometime we got where we started making night 
strikes. This had to be coordinated. Now, for two

43:08.614 --> 43:10.296
forces to do this, geographically separated by 
you know several hundred miles it definitely took

43:10.630 --> 43:37.448
very careful and close coordination otherwise 
you're going to run into problems and we did run

43:10.630 --> 43:37.448
into a few problems because of this very reason and 
that's reason got to be one air commander then on

43:10.630 --> 43:37.448
top of this you throw in SAC yeah and who were very 
you know prone to defend their right to operate

43:10.630 --> 43:37.448
freely because of the and maybe naturally so, 
because of the fact they might have to pull out at

43:38.272 --> 43:45.404
any minute to go on nuclear attacks in another war, 
you know. It made it difficult. Of course, General

43:49.029 --> 43:56.482
Momar got support from the Air Force, I don't know, 
through Chief Stack, naturally. Even Sack got

43:57.363 --> 44:02.271
support from the standpoint of the Navy. But, of 
course, when he got back to Washington, the

44:03.280 --> 44:06.703
decision had to be made. Of course, the Navy 
commander, or the carrier right there in the

44:06.823 --> 44:14.910
ocean, he had his channels of command, too, so he'd 
go back. Well, of course, these channels would

44:14.930 --> 44:18.153
meet in Washington naturally. Oh, for a big 
problem like this, it's always pretty close by.

44:21.696 --> 44:25.058
And, as usual, you know, they discuss it and rave 
and rant about it. Maybe JCS fell, and probably, as

44:25.118 --> 44:29.882
a matter of fact, it gets up to a precedent level. 
Sure. You can understand. And it gets difficult.

44:33.487 --> 44:55.073
Well,

44:33.487 --> 44:55.073
in these very difficult problems,

44:33.487 --> 44:55.073
demanded and, you know, and discussed and pushed 
by very strong-willed people on both sides and

44:33.487 --> 44:55.073
very capable and sincere people on both sides, it 
gets tough. You've got to be a referee, an

44:55.093 --> 44:57.375
arbitrator. And that's what we're going to say 
sometimes, go clear for president.

45:04.891 --> 45:07.836
The usual answer you find is a compromise. And

45:08.978 --> 45:16.750
that's what happened over there. General Momar 
never did get full control of the Navy air, but this

45:16.770 --> 45:31.995
brought about very, very careful and close 
coordination, which was, got to the point where it

45:16.770 --> 45:31.995
was very well done, very capable, and very 
efficient. How about the quality of the Navy

45:36.134 --> 45:39.698
airstrikes? Fantastic. Just as good as ours. Just 
as good as the Air Force. Right. Except, except in

45:44.124 --> 45:46.607
some areas. I don't think the Navy had the ECM 
capability we had in the, that's the name I got to

45:47.107 --> 46:01.265
find out about this strike

45:47.107 --> 46:01.265
launching aircraft. It killed them. But you don't 
think that the Navy had some of the electronic

46:03.498 --> 46:18.262
capabilities, but basically, as far as the 
quality of their pilots and competence and

46:03.498 --> 46:18.262
achieving their task, they were as good as the Air 
Force? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Sounds like

46:20.486 --> 46:23.731
there's a lot of inter-service rivalry in this 
job. Is this true? Right. That's what you're

46:25.253 --> 46:26.676
talking about. At the higher level. You get down 
where the pilots are. fly and eat and sleep

46:30.818 --> 46:40.221
together ain't no problem no uh but uh well it 
sounds like a lot of egos
