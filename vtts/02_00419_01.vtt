00:01.415 --> 00:04.358
Angela Caso, C-A-S-S-O. C-A-S-S-O. Apparently 
it sounds like an Italian name, but it seems like

00:07.963 --> 00:17.354
generations back it was spelled C-A-Z-O. Why and 
who changed it, we don't know. But now the whole

00:21.639 --> 00:24.983
family is C-A-S-S-O. And I was born in Revolaredo. 
So was my sister. So was my mother. And my father was

00:34.171 --> 00:37.075
born in the state of Coahuila. But they moved. I 
really don't know how young he was when they moved

00:39.098 --> 00:43.684
to Nuevo Laredo. And he and my mother were married 
when she was only 16 years old. She was just a child,

00:51.293 --> 00:54.337
so to speak. And there were only two of us, my 
sister, who is four years older than myself, and I.

01:00.578 --> 01:04.762
Unfortunately, we lost mother when I was just a 
very, very young baby. And even though my father

01:05.783 --> 01:15.473
was very young, he did not remarry until after we 
were married and after I had children. So, as a

01:15.493 --> 01:27.766
consequence, he moved in, or rather, my 
grandmother, my father's mother, was a widow. And

01:27.786 --> 01:29.067
she had to... daughters and married daughters, 
and one of his sisters, his oldest sister, was the

01:29.620 --> 01:45.876
one who raised me, who raised us, but I think of her 
just like my mother because she actually took care

01:29.620 --> 01:45.876
of me since I was five months old. I don't stop to 
realize that I'm sure my grandmother had a lot to do

01:46.637 --> 01:49.960
with it. Was your grandmother living with you too? 
Yes, in other words, my father, when mother died,

01:58.358 --> 02:00.440
my father moved in with his family. Or rather, he 
made a home for his family. He was always

02:04.825 --> 02:12.213
supporting my widowed grandmother and his two 
sisters, young sisters. And so from there on, of

02:13.334 --> 02:21.042
course, there were different moves because my 
father was a customs man. He worked for customs. He

02:22.543 --> 02:26.087
had an important position. And we lived for a 
while, we lived in what is now, well, in Piedras

02:26.894 --> 02:33.825
Negras. In those days it was called Porfirio Diaz. 
Yes, this was before 1910. Yes. But I don't

02:41.196 --> 02:48.167
remember except that my mother, the one who raised 
me, married at the time. In Piedras Negras. in what

02:51.565 --> 03:19.986
did she marry in oh wow she married a man from this 
side from from the northern side so uh my father in

02:51.565 --> 03:19.986
the meantime had been transferred to piedras 
negras and he took his family my grandmother his

02:51.565 --> 03:19.986
two sisters my sister and myself but that night i 
started crying and crying and crying i wanted mama

02:51.565 --> 03:19.986
i wanted mom so um he wired because i guess in those 
days wiring a sending telegram was Are you

03:20.270 --> 03:23.394
comfortable there, Miss Catherine? Would you 
like to sit on one of these rockers? You try.

03:30.883 --> 03:34.047
It's part of the family's old furniture, too. So 
anyway, my mother and her husband moved to Piedras

03:35.089 --> 03:41.998
Negras because of me. But that's when the 
revolution started, as far as I really don't know.

03:47.304 --> 03:49.467
How old were you when it began? But let's see, I 
guess I was three years old. Then we moved back to

03:55.820 --> 03:58.283
Nuevo Laredo. When, I don't know. I really don't 
know.

04:03.751 --> 04:12.923
About our moving to this side when we actually 
became refugees, I remember some, just vaguely, I

04:13.291 --> 04:17.978
do remember, we lived right in the heart of what is 
now Nueva Laredo. Have you been across? Have you

04:19.900 --> 04:20.822
been to Mexico? All right. The first little plaza, 
let's see, one, two blocks west. That was where our

04:29.754 --> 04:31.196
home was. And I don't remember, it's funny, but I 
just don't remember what the house was like. I know

04:39.008 --> 04:40.350
it was a brick house. I don't remember what 
furniture was in it. I don't remember anything

04:43.416 --> 04:47.002
except one thing, this picture. That's the only 
thing that I remember of my early, early childhood

04:48.745 --> 04:54.976
days. It's a beautiful picture. It's a beautiful 
picture, and it was a picture on her namesake. She

05:02.228 --> 05:09.416
was my father's youngest sister, and she died when 
she was 90 years old, so he named me after her. And I

05:09.476 --> 05:14.082
remember that- Angelina. Angela. Angela. 
A-N-G-L-A, Angela. And of course, she was Angela

05:16.424 --> 05:22.151
Caso, C-A-S-S-O, the same as my name, my maiden 
name. So anyway, that's the only thing that I

05:22.892 --> 05:27.998
remember, that, and I always had a dog. What kind of 
dog? Just a plain old dog. Just any dog. As long as it

05:35.436 --> 05:36.578
was a dog. Ordinary dog. Ordinary dog would do for 
me. And of course my dolls and things like that. And

05:42.925 --> 05:51.256
my father was a very, very, he was not with the 
revolutionists at all. He belonged to the old

05:53.832 --> 05:55.234
party, so to speak. He had been a government 
employee with customs under the administration.

05:59.719 --> 06:03.263
I mean, he was still, he was a porfirista all the 
time. In fact, they used to say that when they asked

06:04.184 --> 06:10.652
me as a young child, no, I would make this question. 
It's very, very childish, but I would always ask

06:11.673 --> 06:19.923
the questions, what are you? Carrancista or 
porfirista? No. Maderista or Porfirista?

06:25.083 --> 06:27.205
Because there was Madero and there was Porfirio.

06:29.948 --> 06:31.470
Católica o protestante? Catholic or Protestant? 
It seemed like they, as far as I was concerned, they

06:33.572 --> 06:39.139
had to be Catholics. Rich or poor? And we weren't 
rich. We were Catholics, yes, but we weren't rich.

06:48.676 --> 06:52.861
But yet I wanted those three qualities. Just like a 
child, I guess. So anyway, I never attended school

06:54.943 --> 06:58.267
in Mexico. Do you remember what year your family 
moved across the border? Sister says that we moved

07:03.753 --> 07:05.916
in 1912. In 1912. So this would have been after Diaz 
was overthrown and Madero had become president.

07:15.046 --> 07:16.928
Yes, but I think that it was The revolution was 
between Huerta. And the Carrancistas. And the

07:22.169 --> 07:23.211
Carrancistas. And Huerta, of course, by that time 
represented the federal government again. Yes,

07:28.339 --> 07:29.260
yes. So my aunt, the one who raised me, lived on this 
side. I remember that many times, I couldn't tell

07:35.750 --> 07:45.885
you how many times, but I do remember that during 
the night they would wake us up and we would have to

07:46.523 --> 07:53.069
walk across because there was the alarm that the 
Revolucionistas were coming. So half asleep and

07:53.089 --> 07:58.674
just they practically dragged us. Of course as I 
say it was right in town and we didn't have a car and

07:58.714 --> 08:07.082
very few people did. So we would cross the bridge 
and get to Mother's. She lived where Crestor is now

08:14.806 --> 08:18.810
located, which is in the very heart of town. And of 
course, we would come and stay with her. Then it

08:22.774 --> 08:24.175
would quiet down. My father would say, all right, 
everything is all right. It was just a false alarm,

08:27.198 --> 08:30.481
so we would get back across. How many times we did 
that, I don't know. But when the real thing

08:36.907 --> 08:42.993
happened, we had already crossed. My 
grandmother. one of my aunts, my sister, and

08:46.244 --> 08:49.547
myself. My father didn't come with us because he 
joined the federal government. And he was... He

08:57.155 --> 08:58.617
joined the military? Well, in other words, I guess 
he wanted to help. And he had been sent the

09:03.562 --> 09:09.528
paycheck, the payroll, for all of the custom men. 
And he felt like he had to find them and pay each one

09:10.349 --> 09:16.015
what was due to him. And so we came, and I do remember 
that my grandmother used to cry quite often

09:16.248 --> 09:25.100
because she hadn't heard from Daddy, of course. I 
wasn't aware of the fact that Daddy was in danger.

09:32.089 --> 09:46.187
Then there's another very,

09:32.089 --> 09:46.187
how shall I put it, very much alive thing

09:32.089 --> 09:46.187
in my mind. And that was when they burned Nuevo 
Laredes. They set fire to Nuevo Laredes. And we

09:52.827 --> 09:59.177
could see the flames and the smoke and everything. 
And my grandmother was crying. She says, there

10:01.721 --> 10:03.063
goes my home. And of course, I mean, I guess they say 
that my grandmother was just thinking that it was

10:03.765 --> 10:10.876
her home. It did go down in fire. I mean, it was 
destroyed. As most of the city was. It was not a big

10:15.929 --> 10:18.772
city, but anyway, everything. And the only thing, 
I don't believe that we brought any clothes with

10:18.832 --> 10:23.597
us. I really don't believe we did. The only thing 
that my grandmother made sure that was crossed at

10:25.539 --> 10:31.785
the very first time was this picture. She brought 
it and left it here for safekeeping. So you had left

10:39.442 --> 10:44.431
and come over here, but you hadn't brought that 
much with you. Perhaps they were planning to go

10:44.771 --> 10:46.655
back? Yes, I'm sure that my father was very 
optimistic. He couldn't believe that the

10:51.002 --> 10:59.577
government would be...

11:00.890 --> 11:03.053
output by the revolution. I don't think anyone 
ever believed it was going to last so long. He

11:05.757 --> 11:11.985
didn't believe, he didn't want to accept the fact 
that unfortunately that was what was happening.

11:12.246 --> 11:15.069
Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for many 
others. So I don't know how many hours or how many

11:17.212 --> 11:24.082
what the fire lasted. I couldn't tell you because 
I'm sure that it was extinguished to the best of

11:24.102 --> 11:30.070
their abilities. whichever way they were able to 
do it. But I remember that after it was all over,

11:35.433 --> 11:41.261
crossing the bridge was no problem. It was just 
like going down the street. There was no

11:43.785 --> 11:47.710
immigration department to ask you where you were 
born. There was no registration at all on either

11:47.730 --> 11:50.054
side? Nothing whatsoever. And my grandmother 
went across the river and she came back and she said

11:52.457 --> 12:01.069
that she had, as a young, Her family was a family of 
means.

12:09.629 --> 12:26.871
My great-grandfather was a wealthy man, and his 
children naturally, in those days, they thought

12:09.629 --> 12:26.871
that the boys were the ones who were supposed to 
keep most everything, not the girls. But she did

12:27.087 --> 12:30.351
have some things like silver pieces. She didn't 
bring any of them. And they were all lost in the

12:32.034 --> 12:33.456
family? They were all lost. The only thing she 
found was all the silver melted. But of course

12:39.744 --> 12:46.934
there was a lot of

12:39.744 --> 12:46.934
robbery around. I mean, it was in the hands of... In 
fact, I don't even know who was responsible. They

12:55.059 --> 13:09.362
even say, my husband, if you would ask my husband, 
he would say that it was the same general who was

12:55.059 --> 13:09.362
with the government that set fire to the Nuevo 
Laredo rather than have it fall in the hands of

13:09.612 --> 13:13.697
the... Carencistas. Yes. But of course, I mean, it 
would be very hard to prove anything like that. Why

13:20.285 --> 13:21.687
would your husband say that? Because he believed 
in the revolution. And you say his family is not...

13:26.112 --> 13:29.716
No, they're not refugees. They've been here for a 
long time. Well, his family was from the little

13:31.599 --> 13:36.425
town of Guerrero. Yes. And his grandfather... 
More or less around that time, I believe, that was

13:40.409 --> 13:44.134
when my husband lost his father. And his mother, 
with all her children, moved to Zapata, to a ranch

13:44.755 --> 13:53.046
that my husband's grandfather had. And his family 
name is Zapata. Yes. Is he a descendant of the

13:56.150 --> 13:58.613
Antonio Zapata? No, no. Not to my knowledge. I 
really don't know. He always makes a joke of it, and

14:02.238 --> 14:07.986
he says that he comes from...

14:09.468 --> 14:16.715
Zapata, the revolutionist Emiliano Zapata. 
That's a long way off. He makes a big joke out of it. I

14:22.461 --> 14:31.490
don't believe that he really knows whether, he 
says that there was some relation with Antonio

14:22.461 --> 14:31.490
Zapata. Yes. And the problem was because the name 
Zapata is not a very common name. And so after that,

14:39.033 --> 14:42.876
we stayed here. And I remember that when my father 
came back, of course my grandmother was elated

14:43.677 --> 14:51.765
over the fact that her son was back home. But there 
was no working here. I mean, we were left

14:56.569 --> 15:00.653
absolutely penniless. And we couldn't stay with 
mother because her home was big. An average size

15:09.020 --> 15:13.826
home for a couple, but not for four more people. 
Let's say four more people. Because it was my

15:16.470 --> 15:20.114
father, my grandmother, and five. My aunt, my 
sister, and myself. So we moved. I can't even

15:25.641 --> 15:27.163
remember where. Houses were very, very hard to 
find. At first we lived in a small, small place that

15:31.909 --> 15:37.997
I can't even tell you. The only thing that I 
remember is that my father said, you girls cannot

15:38.365 --> 15:46.233
go out and play with anyone here in this 
neighborhood. Because I guess he felt like they

15:46.273 --> 15:52.579
were not our class, our kind. But we grabbed 
whatever we could. And surviving was actually the

15:55.642 --> 16:02.328
main thing. And many other people, like the 
Longorias, came, you know, . I've heard the name.

16:13.554 --> 16:14.014
All right. They came and moved in with my aunt, who 
lives at a corner from us. Because they, too,

16:20.560 --> 16:24.844
didn't have a house in which they were to move to. 
Well, Loretta was really full of refugees at that

16:25.064 --> 16:27.446
time. Yes, that was the trouble. See, so you 
grabbed whatever you could. Then we moved to

16:31.810 --> 16:35.273
another house, and it was half of the house. We 
lived in half of the house, the other half of the

16:35.313 --> 16:37.515
house. a friend of my daddy's read, he and his wife. 
And it was like that for several years until we were

16:42.105 --> 16:57.483
able to, daddy was able to get back on his own two 
feet and we started school and that's about it.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.967
Well what kind of work did your father eventually 
find? Well at first he did anything. I really don't

17:04.040 --> 17:07.885
know what he did, but he would do just anything. But 
finally, that's when custom brokers started. My

17:14.113 --> 17:20.181
husband is a custom broker, a forwarding agent. 
That's what they're called now. But we used to call

17:21.442 --> 17:25.307
them custom brokers, agente aduanal. And my 
father worked with an agente aduanal. He ran the

17:29.504 --> 17:32.248
office for Mr. Gonzalez. And, of course, it was in 
his line of work because he had always been a custom

17:32.929 --> 17:36.954
man. Had he spoken English before the Revolution? 
No, he didn't speak a word of English. Not a word. He

17:42.622 --> 17:44.064
never knew any English. He never did learn. I never 
heard a word of English in my home. Never. Not a

17:47.949 --> 17:48.490
word.

17:51.534 --> 17:54.938
So that made it even more difficult for him on this 
side. Of course, Spanish here was the main

17:54.958 --> 17:57.722
language.

18:01.212 --> 18:30.612
you would go to the stores and everybody knew what 
you were talking about so it wasn't as much of a

18:01.212 --> 18:30.612
handicap as it would have been someplace else now 
knowing English or vice versa knowing Spanish is a

18:01.212 --> 18:30.612
must we live in a bilingual absolutely bilingual 
Laredo is almost completely on both sides

18:01.212 --> 18:30.612
bilingual community it is a bilingual community 
really And I don't remember of any, absolutely, I

18:31.452 --> 18:39.688
absolutely don't remember of any...

18:43.375 --> 18:52.313
When I started school, I don't remember that I 
was...

18:53.137 --> 18:58.564
The fact that I came from Mexico or that I was 
Mexican had anything to do with it. Of course, most

18:58.664 --> 19:09.277
of my classmates were Mexican, of Mexican 
descent, maybe Americans, because we keep on

18:58.664 --> 19:09.277
thinking of Mexicans when we are really American. 
I am an American in that I became an American

19:09.598 --> 19:13.022
citizen. My husband still is a Mexican citizen. He 
is. Yes. And when my grandmother passed away, She

19:22.381 --> 19:23.845
was buried in Mexico. When my father passed away, 
he was buried in Mexico. My uncle passed away and

19:29.081 --> 19:31.788
his wife passed away. They were buried in Mexico. 
So they retained very strong emotional ties. They

19:36.790 --> 19:39.152
were very, very strongly tied to. And we still are. 
We are. Why did your father not return to Mexico

19:41.315 --> 19:44.899
after the revolution? Because he was not allowed 
to go. Well, things quieted down. Yes, they

19:50.585 --> 19:52.207
quieted down. But he was absolutely against 
everything that the revolutionists stood for.

20:01.718 --> 20:03.340
And they, naturally, they would have In the first 
place, he didn't want to go as long as it was in the

20:03.775 --> 20:11.951
hand of the new party. And in the second place, 
there was a danger of his being imprisoned. He was

20:18.063 --> 20:20.548
still identified with the idea. Yes. He was still 
identified, and not only that, he was still

20:21.309 --> 20:24.636
helping. Yeah, Felix Diaz was still in Mexico, or 
off and on, up until 1919 or later, wasn't he? I

20:35.031 --> 20:36.613
believe he was. There was always the possibility 
of Diaz countering. Well, Felix was the nephew.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.282
Yes, those were my father's dreams. And I remember 
that he used to cry, literally cry. You could see

20:49.386 --> 20:55.112
his tears rolling down his cheeks when he stood and 
looked across. into his country, or he would hear

20:55.632 --> 21:04.222
the bugles, because Laredo was a very quiet town. 
So if the soldiers were, if for any reason you could

21:04.923 --> 21:13.333
hear the bugles, he would cry. He longed to be in 
Mexico. I don't remember, I don't know what year it

21:16.336 --> 21:20.541
was that he went back. But we never returned. We 
stayed here. Because there was actually, there

21:25.687 --> 21:29.092
wasn't anything for him to do in Mexico. What year 
did he die? Daddy died in 1952. In 1952. The first

21:34.600 --> 21:40.009
year that I know, I remember in September of 1952. 
So I remember that our oldest son had been, that was

21:40.409 --> 21:47.199
his first year in college when Daddy died. He had 
just gone off to Missouri to Kemper Military

21:47.219 --> 21:54.951
School in Missouri when Daddy died. and but he 
always and at the time by then he was living in

21:56.213 --> 22:22.558
mexico oh he did go back i remember i told you that he 
remarried yes he remarried now when was this yeah

21:56.213 --> 22:22.558
this is after you were grown yes well uh my little 
brother would be i

21:56.213 --> 22:22.558
think that daddy must have remarried in uh

22:25.593 --> 22:28.441
Let me see, 52 and about 43. And was his wife from 
here or from Mexico? No, she was from Mexico. From

22:32.914 --> 22:34.900
where in Mexico? From a little small town between 
Monterey and Nuevo Laredo. which is called, it's

22:39.093 --> 22:43.179
almost non-existent now. Well, Sabina Sedalgo 
has existed. No, yes, it's another little town.

22:47.406 --> 22:51.131
Oh, there's a little ghost, there's a little 
almost ghost mining town down there. All right,

22:51.492 --> 22:51.972
that's a lot. Yeah, I know where it is. That's where 
she was originally from. And my father, even

22:55.618 --> 23:06.214
though he was, I mean, he was not, he was still 
considerably, he was old, but... Not too old not to

23:06.802 --> 23:09.067
be able to bear children. What year was he born? 
Daddy? I

23:13.097 --> 23:18.069
have to go back and think. I really don't know. 
Maybe.

23:22.480 --> 23:22.600
Maybe. In 1980. 1980. No. Well, how old was he when 
he died? I don't remember. No. But it was about

23:33.165 --> 23:34.247
1980. More or less around 1980. Well, then after he 
married, the second time he returned to Mexico.

23:40.737 --> 23:41.958
Yes, and he had this child. And he naturally, he 
adored him because he was, well, for one thing, We

23:51.605 --> 23:52.686
two were married. My sister and I were married. And 
he loved my children very, very dearly. I already

23:58.051 --> 23:59.392
had my two sons. But

24:00.393 --> 24:08.500
my father's name was Gustavo, and they named my 
little brother Gustavo also. We called him

24:08.540 --> 24:10.622
Tabito. He was a very, very lovely child, and a 
beautiful child too, unfortunately. Daddy

24:15.407 --> 24:20.211
passed away in 52, and unfortunately, Tabito 
developed cancer of the lungs and died when he was

24:21.001 --> 24:26.147
18 years old. That's so unusual. It just went like 
this, like

24:27.468 --> 24:33.415
fire.

24:36.899 --> 24:38.781
And his mother, is she still alive? Yes, his mother 
is still alive. We don't see her very often because

24:40.343 --> 24:47.431
she's not in Abuelaredo most of the time. There are 
times when she is. Well, it was a very short-lived

24:49.486 --> 24:52.710
relationship. Not that we were against daddy 
remarrying, because I think that it was wonderful

24:53.351 --> 25:01.120
that he didn't give us a stepmother when we were 
young. So we realized that he needed a wife. He

25:06.386 --> 25:10.611
needed someone to look after him, even though he 
has. But it would have never been the same. But he

25:15.237 --> 25:18.160
didn't live long enough to... to see his little boy 
grow up. In fact, my brother, my half-brother was

25:22.714 --> 25:44.444
much younger than my children because I have my 
oldest son is 37 and my second son will be 34

25:22.714 --> 25:44.444
tomorrow. My baby is 27. She's a girl. She's 
married, too. And my two brothers were already, my

25:55.240 --> 26:02.469
two boys were already born. In fact, my daughter 
was born, Tabitha was born in March, and

26:02.509 --> 26:11.960
Mariangela came in November of that same year. And 
Daddy would I tell Tavito, these are your nephews.

26:19.456 --> 26:20.397
They are your nephews. You're their uncle. And of 
course, it was very hard for my children to

26:23.360 --> 26:30.047
understand that Tavito was their uncle when they 
were older than he was. I can see why. Well, when

26:31.648 --> 26:34.792
your father moved back to Mexico, it was to Nuevo 
Laredo. Yes. Had he retired then, or did he? No, he

26:38.376 --> 26:39.377
was still working. He worked until the very last. 
In fact, he was bookkeeper for... for a big liquor

26:44.675 --> 26:50.141
store, Escamilla. And he worked there until he 
died. He died on this side. By the time he went back

26:57.509 --> 27:04.477
to Mexico, how did he feel about the revolution and 
everything that had happened? Well, he was

27:04.497 --> 27:07.961
bitter. He was always bitter. But he admitted, I 
mean, the fact that they had no chance. that was

27:14.763 --> 27:19.608
past history and they would have to accept it as it 
was. And he was friendly with the people, with the

27:20.529 --> 27:35.805
government people and everybody respected him 
and there was no

27:20.529 --> 27:35.805
animosity between them. Of course he was one of the 
old timers and he had old timer friends who were

27:36.386 --> 27:42.492
living in Nuevo Laredo. And so he actually made a 
comeback, so to speak. Unfortunately, my

27:48.380 --> 27:52.205
grandmother sold her property. She says, we'll 
never move back to Mexico. I might as well sell it.

27:59.415 --> 28:03.862
And my father was very much against it, but it was 
her own home. Just the land, naturally, because

28:05.664 --> 28:11.753
the house was destroyed.

28:12.121 --> 28:19.361
Right now it's very, very valuable, but it was her 
desire and there wasn't anything we could do. This

28:19.401 --> 28:21.828
is not infrequent.

28:24.095 --> 28:27.143
There's a very interesting story about from some 
towns I studied that were disrupted by Paricutin

28:27.275 --> 28:31.984
volcano. Yes. And they moved and they sold. Yeah. 
And one man, he didn't even sell his land. Of

28:38.095 --> 28:40.319
course, volcanic ash had fallen on it. And it 
wasn't worth anything then. But it's very good

28:42.784 --> 28:43.845
now. What he did was tear his papers up. He just tore 
them up and burned them and said, no more town, no

28:48.031 --> 28:53.496
more land, and left. And they say he still cries 
about it. He lives in California now. He sits down.

29:00.724 --> 29:03.286
Crying won't bring it back, though. Not even 
selling it. But this is not uncommon, apparently.

29:07.771 --> 29:12.456
It's just a reaction to catastrophe, really. I 
guess so. I'll remember that, just in case. But

29:18.360 --> 29:23.807
now, your mother's, or your father's family from 
Coahuila, what town were they from? Candela.

29:24.848 --> 29:25.569
Candela. Yes. Were they ranchers or ? Yes, yes, and 
ranchers. So I remember that my grandmother used

29:31.156 --> 29:43.030
to say that when they would travel from one, from 
Candela to some other place, she had many sisters,

29:31.156 --> 29:43.030
and they would all wear sort of like porcelain that 
were made for that purpose with wide strips. And

29:54.361 --> 29:56.343
those were filled with the gold coins. Because I 
imagine they feared being attacked.

30:04.992 --> 30:07.674
They raised a lot of sheep and goats. And when my 
great grandfather would sail, I guess, I don't

30:12.811 --> 30:19.699
know, I remember that one thing that my 
grandmother used to tell us. Her name was Barreda.

30:24.425 --> 30:26.727
B-A-R-R-E-D-A. And she said, she used to tell us 
that actually her name was De La Barreda. De La

30:33.535 --> 30:34.496
Barreda. And there were two brothers who were 
given Well royalties from Spain, one was his name

30:43.085 --> 30:57.349
was Ramon and the other one was Fructuoso and this 
Ramon was my great great grandfather. Did he come

30:58.270 --> 30:59.993
directly from Spain? Yes, directly from Spain and 
Fructuoso was lost. They don't know whether the

31:06.644 --> 31:08.788
Indians caught him or what. They never did hear 
from him anymore. So the only branch of the La

31:12.772 --> 31:19.418
Barredas was from this Ramon de la Barreda. But 
then they dropped the De La and just called

31:19.438 --> 31:22.982
themselves Barreda. It seems like I read 
somewhere that a lot of families dropped the De La

31:23.483 --> 31:31.671
during the war for Mexican independence or 
shortly afterwards. Well, I imagine it could have

31:31.691 --> 31:36.316
been then that they did it. But there were rich 
people. And my grandfather, Picasso, came from a

31:38.982 --> 31:45.090
small town, Ahualewas. Ahualewas is in the state 
of Nuevo León. Now how did he, oh wait a minute,

31:52.359 --> 31:57.786
that's your father, how did he meet your mother? My 
father, or you're talking about my grandfather,

32:01.823 --> 32:05.247
My grandfather was from Ahualewas. Oh, your 
grandfather. How did he meet your grandmother?

32:08.570 --> 32:09.911
Oh, that I don't know. She never told you that? I 
wish she would have told me. I wish. She would have

32:13.395 --> 32:14.256
been interested. And the only aunt we had living, 
who had a tremendous memory, my daddy's older

32:14.276 --> 32:29.772
sister, older than himself, she remembered, she 
knew everything, but we never took We never

32:30.190 --> 32:35.116
stopped to ask her those little things that mean so 
much in life. In fact, she gave me this set. It was

32:38.300 --> 32:43.607
hers, and she told me, you keep it, you take it. And 
so I treasure it most highly, and I treasure that

32:43.627 --> 32:47.933
picture, too. Because that picture, to me, is part 
of my childhood. Wherever I went, the first thing

32:51.898 --> 32:58.847
that my grandmother would sit doing was that the 
picture was hung in a place where it's very heavy,

32:59.283 --> 33:05.551
where it wouldn't break or fall or something. Did 
your aunt also come to the United States, your

33:06.953 --> 33:10.598
father's older sister? Yes. The one I'm talking 
about? No, no. She lived in Nuevo Laredo. Her

33:18.008 --> 33:19.870
husband also came from Candela. And they came, I 
imagine, during the revolution, they came to

33:21.212 --> 33:27.440
Nuevo Laredo. I really don't know when. And they 
only had one daughter, and she still lives. She's

33:34.592 --> 33:40.918
still living, and she has a nice home on Aveo 
Avenue, but she lives by herself. And she's a very

33:41.639 --> 33:43.181
strange person. I mean, she's had a hard life in 
that she's by herself. Economically, she doesn't

33:48.946 --> 33:52.249
like anything. But she lives a very, very sad life, 
and no matter We asked her to come over and spend

33:59.628 --> 34:02.856
some days with us. Oh no, she would never think of 
leaving her home. And so as a result, her life is

34:06.565 --> 34:11.237
rather sad. She reads a lot. And she's up to 
everything. But her mother had a tremendous

34:16.827 --> 34:20.632
memory, I'm telling you. This is actually your 
grandmother's sister you're talking about. No,

34:23.656 --> 34:25.859
I'm talking about my father's sister. Your 
father's sister. His oldest sister. I didn't know

34:27.862 --> 34:30.305
any of my grandmother's sisters. None of them. 
This is your father's oldest sister. I did know my

34:33.169 --> 34:37.375
grandmother's brother, Ramon. Named after his 
father, Ramon de la Valeria.

34:45.595 --> 34:50.965
lived in Monterey, at least his daughters still 
live in Monterey. So, and then on my mother's side,

34:53.188 --> 35:04.228
my grandfather also worked, he was a custom man 
also, and his name was Barrera.

35:06.959 --> 35:09.563
B-A-R-R-E-R-A. Well, that's very similar. Very 
similar, except for the D. So I'm Caso on my

35:11.285 --> 35:17.673
father's side, Barrera on my mother's side. And 
then Barrera, my third name, and then Martinez.

35:24.883 --> 35:28.788
Now, after you came here, you went to school. Oh, 
yes. How long did you go to school? Well, I

35:31.792 --> 35:36.679
graduated from high school, and then... I started 
teaching without, with nothing but a teacher's

35:37.216 --> 35:50.171
certificate that you were able to obtain by taking 
a Jillian. I went to summer school in San Marcos and

35:50.391 --> 35:59.542
I took what was required in order to obtain a 
teaching certificate. And we took exams. every

36:02.225 --> 36:07.232
single course that we had taken during our 12 years 
of school. Everything, just everything. And I got

36:11.177 --> 36:13.961
my certificate, and I felt like I was safe. I came 
home with my certificate, ready to teach. A

36:20.910 --> 36:25.517
requirement to teach was you had to be an American 
citizen. My father said no.

36:30.490 --> 36:35.857
You are a Mexican, and I want you to remain a 
Mexican. But later on, he came in without my

36:37.239 --> 36:59.991
really, I didn't exactly beg him, but I guess I must 
have made him realize that it was a shame that I

36:37.239 --> 36:59.991
could help, and yet I was unable to because of his 
pride to remain always a Mexican citizen. We lived

37:00.173 --> 37:00.994
here. This was a country that had given us a home.

37:08.646 --> 37:15.857
So when I got my citizenship papers, I started 
teaching, as I told you. And I taught for just for 30

37:15.877 --> 37:19.802
years. For 30 years? Just 30 years? Just 30 years. 
But in the meantime, of course, I couldn't keep on

37:22.887 --> 37:27.514
teaching with that little old certificate. they 
offered extension courses from A&I. And we

37:32.658 --> 37:45.838
started, all of us, I mean all of the young teachers 
in those days, we started taking courses because

37:32.658 --> 37:45.838
in the first place, my father wouldn't dream of my 
going to school. Away from home. I went to Austin

37:51.347 --> 37:56.995
for six weeks to the University of Texas But daddy 
took me and we stayed in what was called Newman

37:57.464 --> 38:05.814
Hole, run by nuns. But father thought that being 
run by nuns, we would be in at 8 o'clock and that we

38:06.715 --> 38:18.589
would be supervised by nuns. He didn't realize 
that we were free to do whatever we wanted to. Of

38:22.354 --> 38:26.779
course, I mean, I knew better and I knew exactly how 
to behave. thanks to, I'm proud to say that he

38:27.198 --> 38:31.564
instilled that in us. Then, later on, I kept on 
taking courses here in Laredo. And then, since

38:39.495 --> 38:51.552
Kingsville was not far, I used to take courses by 
going on Saturdays, and by attending school

38:39.495 --> 38:51.552
during the summer months. And I stayed in the city 
court at home, which was run by the Sisters of

38:52.342 --> 38:57.827
Mercy. So the only way that Daddy would have 
consented to my going off to school for a whole one

38:59.168 --> 39:12.461
or two years would have been if I would have been in a 
convict with high walls. Broken glass on top? Yes,

39:15.183 --> 39:17.626
yes, yes. Bless his heart. Well, how many years did 
you teach before you got married? About four. Four

39:24.558 --> 39:24.999
years. And what did you teach? I always taught the 
elementary grades. My last years, I was head

39:31.008 --> 39:34.473
teacher. Then, instead of being assistant 
principal, you were a head teacher. And Mrs.

39:40.022 --> 39:44.308
Smith, I didn't teach in this particular school 
across the street. I taught in another one

39:44.328 --> 39:46.952
that's... Oh, well, more or less going towards 
Zapata. What's called now Dykes School, but it was

39:53.539 --> 39:56.323
Montrose. And I was head teacher there for several 
years. And then I was made, we had a new principal,

40:00.288 --> 40:04.775
Mr. Barrow. And I was made assistant principal. 
And then Mr. Barrow passed away and I was made

40:07.479 --> 40:10.203
principal. So I was a principal for Montrose 
School for several years. And I retired when I was

40:14.248 --> 40:17.513
not Not old, I mean, not old enough to get all the 
benefits. But I thought, well, I've helped my

40:23.201 --> 40:29.028
husband enough, and I want to be home and enjoy 
life. And they used to say, but look, now that

40:29.829 --> 40:36.157
you're a principal, you're going to retire. Yes, I 
made up my mind. I'm going to retire, and that's it.

40:42.805 --> 40:48.192
Would you believe that my first retirement check 
was $79?

40:51.479 --> 40:54.724
I'm still getting it because they're different. 
You can choose one, two, or three, and I can't

40:55.825 --> 40:59.390
remember what number. I think one, you get the 
whole bulk. Number two is something else. I chose

41:04.257 --> 41:09.986
the third,

41:04.257 --> 41:09.986
whatever you call it. And it has been raised. Now I 
get $129.

41:17.450 --> 41:20.855
If you'd taught until you were 65 or something. 
Until I was 60. If I would have taught until I was 60,

41:22.177 --> 41:28.546
I would have made a much, much, much higher salary. 
I mean, I would have received a much higher

41:28.566 --> 41:34.495
retirement check. But I don't regret it. I really 
don't. Because in the first place, my husband

41:36.678 --> 41:40.965
doesn't need it. And I don't feel like I have 
accomplished more by being home. than by

41:47.065 --> 41:48.166
teaching. I enjoyed my years of teaching. I really 
did. And I'm proud to say that my children still

41:51.870 --> 41:54.974
remember me.

41:58.217 --> 42:04.925
Children's mothers still remember me, the 
teachers that were with me when I was a principal.

42:05.445 --> 42:15.857
Whenever they see me, they say, we'll never have 
another principal like you, and things like that,

42:05.445 --> 42:15.857
which do make you feel proud of the fact that you 
retired before you got too cranky. Well, did you

42:18.402 --> 42:24.211
stop teaching at all when you were having your 
children? Except,

42:24.331 --> 42:28.858
let me see. When Renato Jr. was born, I didn't teach 
the first semester because he was born in

42:30.460 --> 42:37.511
November. This was your oldest son. My oldest son. 
Then when Javier was born, I taught all the year,

42:40.171 --> 42:44.477
the whole year. And then when my baby was born, my 
young one was born, I had two miscarriages during

42:44.497 --> 42:52.266
that time. And so the doctor and my husband said, 
no, you're not going to teach. But I felt like I

42:57.253 --> 43:05.443
wanted to teach because I had put so many years that 
I wanted to get the benefits that were due to me.

43:05.463 --> 43:06.565
That's the reason I taught. I've always put it this 
way. At first, I taught because I had to and because

43:09.483 --> 43:13.409
I liked it. First because I liked it and then 
because I had to. Then I taught because my husband

43:17.476 --> 43:30.917
needed, I wanted to help him so that we would really 
be able to get to where we are now. But the last years

43:31.606 --> 43:37.353
that I taught, I taught because I considered that I 
should. I was entitled to a little benefit for all

43:37.373 --> 43:44.402
the years that I had put into the profession. And my 
husband used to say every time, he said, please,

43:44.422 --> 43:59.381
honey, I don't want you to come home and be tearful 
because this little boy didn't have shoes and the

43:44.422 --> 43:59.381
other child needed a haircut and things like that. 
I said, now look. If I sell buttons and lace and

44:01.643 --> 44:16.199
thread, in other words, if I go to work as a clerk, 
then I promise you that I will never come home

44:01.643 --> 44:16.199
talking about my work. But as long as it's children 
that I'm dealing with, I'm going to do it with all my

44:16.600 --> 44:23.367
heart. And I'm going to give them everything that I 
can. There's really no other way. Oh, no.

44:29.925 --> 44:31.607
Otherwise, you're not a teacher. No, you have to be 
calling. You have to have a calling for it. I

44:38.717 --> 44:46.328
baptized children that were 9 and 10 years old, 
because they had never been baptized. I took

44:47.490 --> 44:49.453
children to the barber shop because the mother had 
made a promise that if he got well, they would let

44:49.788 --> 44:59.282
his hair grow, which now would be very, very 
popular. Oh, yes, a promessa. Yes, yes, things

45:02.086 --> 45:04.370
like that. Oh, my, that's interesting. And they 
would come to me, the mothers would come to me, and

45:08.235 --> 45:13.483
my husband didn't bring any money. They cut off the 
gas and they cut off the water. And I remember a

45:16.912 --> 45:25.064
butcher at ATV one time I went and I helped the 
family as I could. And he told me, Ms. Zapata, I want

45:25.124 --> 45:28.649
to ask a favor of you. I don't want you to interfere 
with my family. I said, oh, no. Never will I

45:32.435 --> 45:34.237
interfere with your family. But if your family, if 
your children are hungry, I am going to interfere.

45:39.245 --> 45:42.209
And nobody in this world is going to keep me from 
doing it. Neither you nor I.
