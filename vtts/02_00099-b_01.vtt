WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:17.968
and just coming in to generally harass you and give you a hard time, beat a little butt or whatever he felt like doing in his drunken stupor, and I finally got enough of that.

00:18.128 --> 00:27.962
I said, I'm gonna get Bobby Dixon, but he was smart enough to know that we'd be out for him, and he always locked his door, always.

00:28.347 --> 00:36.275
We had two rooms with a John in between so that there was access through his door and through the other door and through the crapper.

00:38.757 --> 00:45.584
And that meant that both of them had to lock their doors because the crapper didn't have any locks on the door.

00:47.646 --> 00:54.533
Well, I was, like I said, waiting for the right chance.

00:54.553 --> 00:56.175
And one night he came in.

00:56.195 --> 00:57.696
He was always singing and yelling.

00:58.385 --> 01:11.002
He had a car and he'd drive in the back parking lot of Hart Hall and you could hear him as soon as he drove in the lot, yelling and singing and hollering at whoever he was gonna get that particular night.

01:11.803 --> 01:26.282
And anyway, as soon as we heard him coming in, we had a wastebasket, about five gallons, filled it up out of the cooler

01:28.220 --> 01:32.205
and it was wintertime, and I mean this was a cold night.

01:34.187 --> 01:42.336
And for some reason or another, Bobby, we barricaded the door, put the bed up there, blocked ourselves against the wall, because we knew he was coming in, but he didn't.

01:42.356 --> 01:55.932
He went on into his room, and after 30 minutes, we didn't hear anything, so we moved everything out of the way and opened the door, and you could hear him snoring over there, because he was a big, heavy guy.

01:59.793 --> 02:02.257
I checked the door across the hall from me.

02:02.297 --> 02:03.378
Here's his down here.

02:03.398 --> 02:05.462
It's open.

02:06.643 --> 02:07.064
Perfect.

02:10.309 --> 02:17.340
I took that five gallons and tiptoed in there and this is like one or two o'clock in the morning, Sunday morning.

02:18.341 --> 02:20.144
It's always Saturday night, Sunday morning.

02:21.987 --> 02:25.632
He's in there on his back, covered up with blankets,

02:27.755 --> 02:29.738
like this with mouth open snoring.

02:34.524 --> 02:38.308
And I poured five gallons of water right in his face.

02:39.470 --> 02:40.812
Cold water.

02:43.055 --> 02:49.683
And I turned around and ran and slammed that door and tiptoed across the hall.

02:49.703 --> 02:53.067
Of course, we threw the bed.

02:53.147 --> 02:55.230
We put everything we had in that room.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.746
not only up against our door but against the crapper door as well and waited.

03:01.730 --> 03:05.696
And all we could hear was coughing and gurgling.

03:08.059 --> 03:11.484
Not even any cussing, which would be his normal thing.

03:17.654 --> 03:19.176
And I nearly drowned the guy.

03:20.168 --> 03:22.151
He wasn't able.

03:22.712 --> 03:24.415
He was not able.

03:26.598 --> 03:33.069
Not only was he drunk, he was sound asleep with his mouth wide open, and I'd like to have drowned him.

03:33.089 --> 03:40.100
Not that it's funny, but all I can say is he got what he asked for, but never again.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.965
He didn't bother anybody anymore after that.

03:43.506 --> 03:46.851
He was quiet, sedate,

03:47.337 --> 03:50.081
didn't bother anybody after that, so help me.

03:51.923 --> 04:02.718
And Bobby Dixon graduated and went into the Air Force and became a 30-year career officer, and he retired and lives in Austin.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.844
I haven't had a chance to corner him and laugh with him a little.

04:06.864 --> 04:12.251
I hope he'll laugh, but he retired as a colonel in the Air Force.

04:12.271 --> 04:17.158
Now, as you, as you began to

04:17.695 --> 04:28.169
to move up in athletic status, what role did you think athletics played in your life or might play in the future?

04:28.970 --> 04:33.957
Was it, was athletics ever to you as a potential career?

04:34.598 --> 04:34.938
No, sir.

04:35.519 --> 04:36.060
Not at all.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.922
You never thought about coaching or anything like that?

04:38.383 --> 04:38.623
No.

04:39.885 --> 04:43.229
My career goal was set when I was very young.

04:43.309 --> 04:44.992
I wanted to be in agriculture.

04:45.012 --> 04:45.593
Okay.

04:45.613 --> 04:47.415
And I didn't consider any other goals.

04:47.733 --> 04:57.502
I thought about, you know, what was the potential in professional football at one time, but they pay you $10,000 a year maybe to break your bones.

04:58.844 --> 05:03.128
It was not an attractive career at that point in time in the early 1950s.

05:03.568 --> 05:06.992
So I didn't give it any thought at all really.

05:07.993 --> 05:14.259
To whom did you eventually turn when you needed professional advice?

05:14.599 --> 05:15.580
Was there some,

05:15.914 --> 05:21.891
Somebody here that you developed a relationship with, an advisor, like later would be an R.C.

05:21.951 --> 05:25.401
Potts would have had that role in agriculture.

05:34.291 --> 05:50.690
You know, I have thought about that point, Dr. Monroe, about the advisors, the counselors, the role models, the mentor programs.

05:50.730 --> 05:57.598
There's a network, a blanket of it at A&M now, and it's all good.

05:59.418 --> 06:08.987
To my knowledge, very little of that was available except as a one-on-one thing that you developed with a particular person that you respected.

06:10.448 --> 06:11.869
Did you develop that with somebody?

06:12.490 --> 06:16.674
I felt comfortable visiting with Dr. Butler.

06:16.694 --> 06:22.959
He was as much of a role model for me at that time as anybody.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.843
And he was quite willing and quite able

06:27.413 --> 06:30.316
answer any question and serve as a counselor in those days.

06:30.336 --> 06:33.780
He just got perturbed with me when I wanted to change fields.

06:34.240 --> 06:39.266
Did he, would you turn to him for advice on do I take this course or this course?

06:40.347 --> 06:40.667
Yes.

06:41.007 --> 06:41.348
All right.

06:41.368 --> 06:41.768
Oh, yes.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.191
And do you remember any?

06:44.211 --> 06:52.680
But, but when you, if you remember, the, the catalog, the college catalog, Animal Husbandry, had it laid out.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.501
Yeah.

06:53.521 --> 06:55.783
Your options were few.

06:56.337 --> 07:01.625
Your electives were few, 144 hours.

07:02.106 --> 07:11.480
Now, as you're finishing your sophomore year and junior and senior, did you develop some close friendships?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.283
Who were your dearest buddies?

07:20.165 --> 07:36.131
Well, my closest buddy was still my friend from Morenza's Pass, Hal Parks, whom I went, made him into first grade and went through the ninth grade with him, went through A&M with him, went through two and a half years in the Army with him.

07:37.153 --> 07:39.176
Oh my, that is awesome.

07:39.196 --> 07:41.280
And have stayed in touch all of our lives.

07:41.320 --> 07:41.921
That's great.

07:43.043 --> 07:45.767
Know his children and his grandchildren and vice versa.

07:46.270 --> 07:52.825
Hal Parks was my number one friend through all of this, but others, Jimmy Everett down at Bay City.

07:55.952 --> 08:01.545
My goodness, the friendships are many.

08:02.943 --> 08:12.275
Again, Lee Phillips, even though I only lived over in the Corps a short time, Lee Phillips to this day is, to me, good a friend as I've got.

08:12.295 --> 08:13.156
I love the guy.

08:13.176 --> 08:14.518
He's such a wonderful person.

08:18.042 --> 08:19.504
Many of them in the vet school.

08:20.245 --> 08:24.570
I came back to vet school when I was 26 years old and got that degree when I was 30.

08:25.612 --> 08:31.279
And a lot of the people over there I looked to as mentors.

08:31.259 --> 08:39.991
To who, where, you and your buddies when you're undergraduates, if you had an unscheduled Saturday night, it's yours to have good time.

08:40.452 --> 08:41.313
What would you all have done?

08:41.393 --> 08:45.999
Where would you have gone for a, what you all considered a pleasant evening?

08:52.929 --> 08:58.617
Well, there wasn't much social life on this campus, as you know.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.583
If we didn't sneak in Gun Hall, we'd start paying.

09:03.643 --> 09:07.047
After we got our ROTC money, we'd pay the quarter.

09:07.607 --> 09:08.588
We'd go see a movie.

09:09.389 --> 09:26.207
If somebody had a car and would gather up a half a dozen of us, we'd go down to the Triangle and have a hamburger, something to drink.

09:28.685 --> 09:30.189
Come back to the dorm.

09:30.409 --> 09:32.074
Did you go to downtown Bryan much?

09:32.094 --> 09:32.435
Oh, no.

09:33.818 --> 09:34.560
Hardly ever.

09:36.585 --> 09:38.029
We didn't go anywhere.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.833
Now, Whiskey Bridge existed.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.738
Whiskey Bridge existed.

09:41.778 --> 09:46.069
There was a liquor store out there on the north side of Highway 60.

09:48.192 --> 09:49.334
I never went out there.

09:49.554 --> 09:50.135
I didn't drink.

09:50.295 --> 09:55.702
And was, was, uh, Hard Liquors, was it there in your days?

09:55.983 --> 09:56.664
Yes.

09:56.684 --> 09:56.924
Okay.

09:56.944 --> 09:57.345
Uncle Ed's?

09:59.828 --> 09:59.968
Mm-hmm.

09:59.988 --> 10:03.453
Uh, now what, uh, nobody knows exactly where it was.

10:03.513 --> 10:09.862
About how far south of, uh, that intersection with Welburn Road?

10:12.185 --> 10:14.048
Well, now, it was,

10:15.614 --> 10:17.496
Was it down about where Holloman is now?

10:17.516 --> 10:18.277
Was it that far down?

10:18.297 --> 10:19.499
No, it wasn't quite that far.

10:19.979 --> 10:24.625
It was back up this way about where that little shopping center is.

10:24.685 --> 10:27.568
It has a Chinese restaurant or whatever on the left there.

10:27.848 --> 10:31.933
It was not as far as Holloman Street.

10:33.275 --> 10:35.758
On the left, of course, railroad tracks on the other side.

10:36.158 --> 10:36.619
It was there.

10:38.361 --> 10:40.423
I think they had the

10:40.673 --> 10:41.456
What do you call them?

10:41.496 --> 10:41.817
Shuffle.

10:42.058 --> 10:42.620
Shuffleboard.

10:42.901 --> 10:43.905
They had a shuffleboard there.

10:45.110 --> 10:48.422
But I didn't spend a lot of time there.

10:49.313 --> 10:51.556
Let's see, what about MSC?

10:52.016 --> 10:53.618
How often did you and your buddies go?

10:53.638 --> 10:54.519
Oh, every day.

10:55.420 --> 10:59.565
The MSC was the center of activities for us on campus.

10:59.866 --> 11:03.370
It was the post office for us was in the MSC then.

11:05.492 --> 11:07.034
You could get snacks over there.

11:07.094 --> 11:09.036
You could go over there and sit down and study.

11:09.056 --> 11:10.258
They had a bowling alley.

11:10.298 --> 11:14.243
There's one thing that we might do on a Saturday night was go bowl in the bowling alley.

11:15.684 --> 11:18.848
It was the center of activities on campus.

11:19.402 --> 11:23.727
And you all didn't even know the words heroin and marijuana?

11:25.029 --> 11:27.712
I couldn't have told you what either one of them was if you'd have asked me.

11:28.373 --> 11:36.642
And smoking with cigarettes, let's see, Lucky Strikes and Camels and?

11:39.085 --> 11:40.166
That's basically it.

11:40.407 --> 11:45.513
Did, was there much chewing tobacco or snuff?

11:47.034 --> 11:47.535
No.

11:47.701 --> 11:49.303
And no pipes.

11:49.884 --> 11:50.464
No pipes.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.285
That's what I thought.

11:51.365 --> 11:52.967
And cigars were too costly.

11:55.590 --> 11:55.891
Maybe.

11:56.091 --> 12:04.181
Well, I remember, well, after the Georgia game that we won, Coach Bryant brought a box of cigars.

12:04.201 --> 12:04.341
Really?

12:04.501 --> 12:05.202
Shut here, boys.

12:05.823 --> 12:06.323
Light up.

12:07.485 --> 12:08.966
All right, now, you mentioned him.

12:10.228 --> 12:13.692
He's hired after, for you, which year?

12:15.376 --> 12:21.985
Coach Bryant came to work at A&M in February of 1954, just before spring break, spring training.

12:22.025 --> 12:23.487
So you've got one more year left?

12:23.728 --> 12:26.451
I've got one more year of eligibility left.

12:26.832 --> 12:30.156
How did you and your buddies hear that he had been selected?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.563
We didn't hear how he'd been selected.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.667
No, I mean, I mean, yeah, but how did y'all get the news?

12:37.727 --> 12:38.548
That's what I was meaning.

12:43.473 --> 12:45.836
Were you called together or did you read it in the paper?

12:48.078 --> 12:52.343
We were, to my knowledge, Haskell were not called together.

12:52.363 --> 13:08.080
1954 was 47 years ago.

13:11.165 --> 13:20.497
I do not remember a meeting where Coach George called us together and told us that he was leaving and that Coach Bryant was coming.

13:24.061 --> 13:24.682
So help me.

13:25.884 --> 13:30.850
Newspaper, battalion, and word of mouth is the way we got all information then.

13:31.070 --> 13:35.055
And what was the reaction for you and your buddies to his selection?

13:35.075 --> 13:35.576
Do you remember?

13:36.858 --> 13:41.003
A lot of apprehension because

13:41.152 --> 13:45.099
I'll tell you a quick little story that made us wonder what we were in for.

13:46.381 --> 13:54.495
You may not remember, but just the previous year, we went up to Kentucky and played them and beat them.

13:56.558 --> 13:57.460
It was a night game.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.363
And you all were five and five that year.

14:00.385 --> 14:06.315
And after the ball game, we had showered, dressed, and got on our bus.

14:06.852 --> 14:15.264
And as we were leaving, we looked over, I can still see, looking over my right shoulder out of the bus, the stadium is all lit up.

14:15.284 --> 14:21.853
And Coach Bryant has the team out there scrimmaging because they got their butt beat at 11 o'clock at night.

14:22.854 --> 14:28.943
We remembered that.

14:29.003 --> 14:32.387
Do you remember when you first saw him?

14:33.249 --> 14:33.589
Oh, yes.

14:33.609 --> 14:35.131
There was a squad meeting or what?

14:35.151 --> 14:35.712
Oh, no.

14:36.839 --> 14:45.035
Listen, that night that he flew in, he went right to the Grove and got up on the platform, and we got up on there with him.

14:45.877 --> 14:59.083
We were just told that he was going to be there, and we went to the Grove from Hart Hall, and that was our first exposure to him when he pulled his coat off and stomped on it and charmed him.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.145
like only Paul Bryant could do.

15:02.867 --> 15:05.092
And what did you guys think when you got back?

15:05.112 --> 15:07.116
What did you all say to each other when you got back to the dorm?

15:09.802 --> 15:16.296
Well, we'd heard lots of stories about how tough and mean he was.

15:16.681 --> 15:19.464
And we'd seen what he'd done when we beat him up there.

15:19.504 --> 15:25.391
And we saw him get up there and give a good presentation spontaneously.

15:26.192 --> 15:36.884
I mean, I called him the silver-tongued devil because he could charm any kind of crowd, whether it's little old ladies or young people or what.

15:36.944 --> 15:37.624
He could.

15:39.086 --> 15:42.570
He was extremely articulate when he wanted to be.

15:43.445 --> 15:45.787
And he was comparatively young at that time, wasn't he?

15:45.807 --> 15:46.208
Forty.

15:46.929 --> 15:47.629
Early forties.

15:47.890 --> 15:48.670
Forty, forty-one.

15:49.191 --> 15:50.512
Yeah.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.894
And a very imposing man.

15:52.555 --> 15:56.459
About six-three or six-four and about two-thirty.

15:56.659 --> 15:57.960
Oh, I didn't realize he was that big.

15:57.980 --> 15:58.761
He's a big man.

15:59.402 --> 15:59.762
Oh, okay.

15:59.802 --> 16:00.443
So that added.

16:00.783 --> 16:01.404
Imposing.

16:01.564 --> 16:02.365
That added to the.

16:03.306 --> 16:05.688
He could look down and intimidate you.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.091
And did.

16:08.291 --> 16:11.434
Did he call you all together soon after that first night?

16:11.635 --> 16:12.696
Did he call?

16:12.716 --> 16:12.996
No.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.487
I don't remember him calling us together.

16:18.409 --> 16:26.657
In fact, I remember going through spring training with him, and I had a good spring training myself.

16:28.219 --> 16:35.746
He put up a list every day, and he started weeding, started cutting them left and right.

16:35.766 --> 16:36.687
A list of what?

16:37.148 --> 16:40.091
Who was still on the squad.

16:40.391 --> 16:41.312
Oh, oh, oh.

16:42.187 --> 16:47.135
which meant he was going to take that scholarship and then he'd have that many more scholarships to give out.

16:47.175 --> 16:49.017
Well, he didn't take the scholarships away.

16:49.238 --> 16:49.538
Oh, really?

16:49.558 --> 16:52.383
He just said, you're not on the team anymore if you're not on this list.

16:53.204 --> 16:55.287
You finish out your school and you're done.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.973
He cut a lot of folks in spring training.

17:00.094 --> 17:05.142
And surprisingly to all of us, spring training was not that difficult.

17:07.866 --> 17:09.088
I wasn't impressed.

17:10.148 --> 17:16.657
I don't know what his plan was, but he has a card up his sleeve that he showed in August.

17:17.559 --> 17:22.466
What about the assistant coaches that he brought with him?

17:22.486 --> 17:24.569
They were quite capable people.

17:24.589 --> 17:30.257
The only, Jim Owens was probably the most capable of the group.

17:30.377 --> 17:31.379
Okay.

17:31.399 --> 17:33.442
Well, Willie Zappalack was a good man.

17:33.742 --> 17:35.565
I like Willie.

17:35.585 --> 17:36.286
He's an Aggie.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.928
Now, had Willie been here before?

17:38.245 --> 17:39.907
Oh yeah, he was with Ray.

17:40.207 --> 17:40.467
Was he?

17:40.548 --> 17:41.408
Okay, so he's a carryover.

17:41.429 --> 17:43.170
He's the only carryover.

17:43.190 --> 17:46.294
The only carryover.

17:46.314 --> 17:51.219
The downside on the personnel was Smokey Harper, the so-called trainer.

17:52.361 --> 17:55.584
Smokey was totally incompetent.

17:57.046 --> 18:00.590
I didn't even think he was an especially nice kind of fellow.

18:00.610 --> 18:07.257
He was a dipper and chewer, along with his hard liquor.

18:07.912 --> 18:12.439
In total absence of any medical knowledge whatsoever.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.402
He didn't know how to put a Band-Aid on it.

18:14.422 --> 18:17.967
What was Jerry Claiborne's role?

18:18.528 --> 18:22.934
Jerry Claiborne, gosh.

18:23.475 --> 18:33.750
Because I understand that he was the one with my, the people that later I would meet as faculty colleagues a few years later told me he was the one who would come and speak to them very, very tactfully.

18:34.962 --> 18:38.266
if some key football player's grades were in danger.

18:38.787 --> 18:40.930
Never put any pressure on anything.

18:41.371 --> 18:47.719
He would drop his Phi Beta Kappa key so you would be sure and see it as he looked to see what time it was.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.664
And if you didn't comment on it the first time, he'd have to check the time again.

18:56.851 --> 18:57.652
Quite a change.

18:58.453 --> 18:59.194
Quite a change.

18:59.455 --> 19:04.902
Now, at practice, was it obvious that who the head coach was?

19:05.438 --> 19:05.899
Yes, sir.

19:07.101 --> 19:11.229
Almost to the point of, well, he was quite obvious.

19:11.289 --> 19:11.610
Yes, sir.

19:12.331 --> 19:15.417
Did he use strong language in the presence of the team?

19:17.601 --> 19:25.236
Coach Paul Bryant was the most profane man, the most vulgar man,

19:25.874 --> 19:30.564
on the football field of anybody I have ever witnessed in my life, period.

19:30.624 --> 19:32.288
That's what I thought.

19:32.969 --> 19:33.550
Let's see, let me.

19:35.354 --> 19:36.416
So spring training.

19:36.537 --> 19:40.104
What it amounted to, Gene needed some maturing.

19:40.185 --> 19:41.227
Yeah, yeah.

19:41.247 --> 19:44.474
All right, so that first spring was comparatively mild.

19:44.514 --> 19:45.115
Yes.

19:45.095 --> 19:51.805
All right, then you were, do you remember where you worked that last summer before your senior year?

19:51.825 --> 19:52.125
Yes.

19:52.686 --> 19:54.388
I had to go to summer camp.

19:54.609 --> 19:55.089
Ah, yes.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.571
Six weeks at Fort Knox.

19:58.715 --> 19:59.796
Wonderful experience.

19:59.896 --> 20:07.387
How well prepared did you feel being at A&M had made you out front with the best of them?

20:08.829 --> 20:12.975
I felt very comfortable with my training.

20:13.748 --> 20:17.073
and felt competitive with anybody that they stood me up against.

20:17.494 --> 20:24.305
What impression do you think the summer training people had about A&M to begin with?

20:25.287 --> 20:30.595
I thought that they felt like that we'd match up with West Point or anybody else.

20:31.737 --> 20:33.700
They spoke highly of us.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.468
Now, you never considered a lifetime career in the military.

20:38.708 --> 20:39.009
Yes.

20:39.189 --> 20:41.072
Oh, you did?

20:44.107 --> 20:52.097
After graduation, we spent a year at Fort Knox, and then were moved to Frankfurt, Germany, or thereabouts.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.680
And I spent a year there.

20:55.120 --> 21:02.269
And life in the military was pretty cush when there's not a war.

21:02.749 --> 21:07.475
And in 1955 and six, seven, when I was there, there was not a war.

21:07.515 --> 21:11.140
There was a Hungarian uprising, and we were getting ready for that.

21:11.220 --> 21:14.063
We thought we were going to be shipped over there.

21:14.870 --> 21:25.370
I talked to my wife about the possibility of a military career, 20 years, and we decided we would stay over there an extra six months.

21:25.611 --> 21:30.320
So I signed up for an extra six months to give consideration to that.

21:30.580 --> 21:36.692
And the reason that I did that, Dr. Monroe, was that

21:38.866 --> 21:43.595
They wanted me to play football and coach football when I went to the military.

21:43.796 --> 21:46.521
They're the most avid sports fans there are in the world.

21:46.541 --> 21:51.571
They're ridiculous about it is what it amounts to and I won't go into any of those crazy stories.

21:52.393 --> 21:56.942
But I played football at Fort Knox until I absolutely obliterated my left knee.

21:58.104 --> 22:00.469
Bent it backwards and tore everything in there

22:01.934 --> 22:03.638
And then they said they wanted me to coach.

22:04.580 --> 22:16.023
So I coached out the rest of that season and when I got over to Germany, they appointed me the athletic and recreation officer and they wanted me to coach the football team and the basketball team and the baseball team and be a jock.

22:18.889 --> 22:23.098
And okay, I mean, you know, that's not really tough.

22:24.833 --> 22:48.563
But then this Hungarian thing came up and I went to my commanding officer and I said, hey, look, sir, I've been a jock for y'all for about a year and a half now and there's rumblings across the world that might require some military training and I want to be transferred out of this job and I want to go to a line company and learn how to be

22:48.847 --> 22:59.162
a platoon leader or a company commander and they transferred me out and I spent that extra six months learning about that.

22:59.182 --> 23:02.187
I became the executive officer of my company.

23:02.247 --> 23:08.636
My company commander and his wife both were absolute alcoholics and so basically I ran the company.

23:11.019 --> 23:15.546
And we talked about it and talked about it and finally based on

23:17.129 --> 23:22.614
Two things, we said we don't want a military career.

23:22.634 --> 23:29.621
Far and away, the majority of the officers, as well as the NCOs, were alcoholics.

23:30.862 --> 23:31.963
Don't want any part of that.

23:32.504 --> 23:42.654
And number two, we didn't want to raise our children in that environment where we had to move around all the time, changing locations, and we said no, and we gave it up.

23:42.974 --> 23:46.157
That was my extent of considering the military as an option.

23:46.930 --> 23:49.856
It's not a good environment to raise children in.

23:49.876 --> 23:51.591
All right, meanwhile back here

23:52.837 --> 24:05.697
As you're getting ready to be a senior, you go football practice, your senior practice, you reported to College Station and then went west on a bus.

24:06.178 --> 24:06.478
Yes, sir.

24:06.498 --> 24:07.920
To another training location.

24:09.102 --> 24:11.085
Much to everybody's surprise.

24:11.746 --> 24:17.034
I was going to ask, y'all did not know that the- No prior knowledge, didn't even know where we were going when we got on the bus.

24:18.637 --> 24:20.700
And did anybody tell you?

24:22.402 --> 24:27.970
Oh, at some point when we were on that bus trip, somebody said we were going to Junction.

24:28.390 --> 24:32.916
Did nobody told you to bring clothes for a certain period of time?

24:33.017 --> 24:34.238
They told us what to bring.

24:34.739 --> 24:35.300
Oh, okay.

24:35.320 --> 24:39.986
But like one change of clothes.

24:40.006 --> 24:45.814
We didn't have anything to do out there but play football and lick our wounds in between.

24:46.175 --> 24:47.937
Yeah, about 100 people.

24:48.490 --> 24:49.131
went out there?

24:49.571 --> 24:50.392
That's what they say.

24:50.472 --> 24:52.074
Somebody said there was 111 of us.

24:52.134 --> 24:52.815
Okay.

24:54.016 --> 25:01.043
And describe the, when you first saw the facilities at Junction, describe those.

25:04.227 --> 25:05.668
Let me close that window there.

25:06.069 --> 25:06.950
Take that off.

25:08.491 --> 25:13.637
When you got to Junction, what did it look like, the NX?

25:15.963 --> 25:18.526
Well, it looked primitive.

25:20.028 --> 25:23.471
There were these little Quonset huts.

25:23.491 --> 25:26.375
I don't remember how many, half a dozen maybe.

25:28.337 --> 25:36.085
And, but it was right next to the Llano River and that was flowing, believe it or not, in 1954.

25:36.105 --> 25:41.211
And I remember the first afternoon,

25:42.743 --> 25:44.605
He said, you all can go swimming if you want.

25:44.625 --> 25:46.866
We went swimming one time and that was it.

25:47.887 --> 25:48.027
Really?

25:49.108 --> 25:56.314
And, but kind of barren because of the drought.

25:56.775 --> 25:58.216
It was terribly dry out there.

25:58.256 --> 26:04.321
Now the, what was a typical day's activities?

26:04.622 --> 26:10.567
What time did you all get up and start practice and so forth?

26:10.607 --> 26:12.328
Get up before daylight.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.047
eat breakfast if you dared.

26:16.749 --> 26:28.085
Most of us were smarter than that by daylight which would be oh I don't know somewhere around seven o'clock or so.

26:33.312 --> 26:41.083
We'd hit the practice field which was nothing but a sandlot with no grass, rocks,

26:41.924 --> 26:44.027
cactus, whatever, it was just a pasture.

26:45.449 --> 27:06.936
And it would go about three hours, somewhere between 10, 10.30 you'd be through, and come in and go down to the river

27:09.059 --> 27:37.159
wash the sweat and dirt off of you which was just right there and then go get in your bunk before it got too hot so you could rest a little and lick your wounds and eat lunch and by that time

27:37.882 --> 27:46.694
it was probably over 100 degrees and those little Quonset huts were just 10.

27:51.420 --> 28:04.638
You'd really, between the two scrimmages each day, you'd try to rest and relax and drink and drink.

28:05.699 --> 28:06.420
I'm telling you,

28:08.324 --> 28:16.232
The worst practices I've ever seen in my life anywhere.

28:16.252 --> 28:19.936
Now, and the afternoon was about three-hour practice also?

28:19.956 --> 28:20.596
About the same.

28:21.057 --> 28:21.277
Right.

28:21.437 --> 28:25.141
Then you took a break, came in for supper.

28:25.161 --> 28:26.162
Clean up and go in for supper.

28:26.542 --> 28:28.664
What was there at night?

28:29.325 --> 28:30.386
Was there anything else?

28:31.948 --> 28:34.230
I don't remember any.

28:34.717 --> 28:36.900
There wasn't even a place to meet at night.

28:37.160 --> 28:41.587
Well, oh, oh, and so, okay, so there was no squad meeting or lectures or?

28:42.027 --> 28:42.809
Oh, no.

28:42.829 --> 28:43.850
No, there weren't any lectures.

28:44.030 --> 28:53.604
These two practices, were they by and large as an entire team or did they all break down to the backs and the offense and the defense and all that?

28:54.245 --> 29:00.874
Well, it depends on at what stage of the time frame.

29:01.075 --> 29:02.817
When we're starting out,

29:04.788 --> 29:07.030
and depend on Coach Bryant's attitude.

29:07.570 --> 29:11.394
His attitude just kept getting worse and worse and worse.

29:12.455 --> 29:17.599
And there are many stories that I could relate about that.

29:17.759 --> 29:32.031
Almost invariably, if you are a coach, you know you have to warm up.

29:32.472 --> 29:34.153
So, you know, we'd have calisthenics.

29:34.505 --> 29:37.788
and that would be in the neighborhood of 15 minutes or so.

29:37.828 --> 29:53.405
You would start, actually run around to whatever, a couple of laps to get loosened up and then you have the calisthenics and then you break up and then start doing two-on-ones and, you know, different procedures.

29:53.425 --> 30:03.195
But what I'm saying is that with each subsequent day that there was less and less of this,

30:03.597 --> 30:07.583
and more and more of nothing but get out there and start knocking heads and scrimmage.

30:07.803 --> 30:09.566
Oh, okay.

30:10.988 --> 30:18.540
In fact, there were times when he'd come out and say, we're just going to start scrimmaging first, period, without even warming up.

30:19.561 --> 30:24.368
And almost everybody's involved.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.812
Almost nobody is standing around doing nothing.

30:27.313 --> 30:30.077
No, there's nobody that's standing around.

30:30.665 --> 30:49.624
The ones that are injured, if there are any injured, they're doing what they need to do to rehabilitate and everybody else is participating because it quickly became hard to find 22 people to line up against each other.

30:50.545 --> 30:56.711
And during, in that era, didn't drink water or any other liquid during practice, did you?

30:57.031 --> 30:57.772
That's what I thought.

30:58.293 --> 30:58.613
Nothing.

30:58.753 --> 31:00.655
Salt pills after practice?

31:01.445 --> 31:02.146
Salt tablets?

31:02.166 --> 31:05.770
They gave salt tablets out during the day, yes.

31:06.371 --> 31:09.375
But you have to be careful about taking them and they make you throw up.

31:09.395 --> 31:10.196
They sure did me.

31:11.157 --> 31:18.686
And then when practice was over, was there anything that anybody drank other than water?

31:21.810 --> 31:25.996
Not other than at mealtime when we had tea.

31:27.297 --> 31:31.182
There were, I don't remember any soft drinks there, just tea.

31:31.921 --> 31:34.990
And you drank it by the gallon actually.

31:35.491 --> 31:42.572
When did some, when did, how many days was it before some people started leaving?
