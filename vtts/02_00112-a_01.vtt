WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:05.721
It is one, two, three, four, testing, testing, testing.

00:06.302 --> 00:08.688
One, two, three, four, testing, testing, testing.

00:10.953 --> 00:14.021
This is the first of December of the year 2000.

00:14.943 --> 00:18.732
We are seated in the library and I have the honor and

00:19.336 --> 00:23.527
pleasure of interviewing Professor Rodney Hill.

00:24.249 --> 00:28.721
To begin with, Rodney, describe your background, experience.

00:28.761 --> 00:29.343
Where did you grow up?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.689
Where did you go to school?

00:31.709 --> 00:31.930
Okay.

00:32.912 --> 00:34.015
Describe Rodney Hill.

00:34.256 --> 00:35.860
Born in Lubbock, Texas.

00:35.840 --> 00:47.896
I'm 1939 and raised there and my dad was president of the Tech X's my freshman year in college so that's where I went to school.

00:49.799 --> 00:56.127
And then after school I went to Dallas and worked for three years with Pratt Box and Henderson.

00:56.107 --> 01:00.471
which was a really exciting firm there, and then he went on to be dean at Texas.

01:01.472 --> 01:05.997
And then I went to work in—well, after Dallas, I got registered.

01:06.398 --> 01:11.022
Then took off for six months to Europe and did the grand tour by myself.

01:11.723 --> 01:20.612
And then went to Houston, worked with CRS, and then Kenneth Benson, Lloyd Benson's brother, and ended up designing a lake house for Lloyd.

01:20.592 --> 01:29.666
And then I'd always been interested in psychology and creativity and Berkeley had just opened up a program.

01:30.807 --> 01:33.391
And so I applied there and got accepted.

01:34.032 --> 01:34.854
What year was that?

01:34.874 --> 01:36.236
That was 67.

01:37.457 --> 01:38.299
UC Berkeley?

01:38.319 --> 01:38.920
UC Berkeley.

01:39.761 --> 01:41.824
And took off.

01:41.804 --> 01:49.531
for California and stay there and finished up, you know, my graduate degree and then started interviewing around.

01:49.752 --> 01:54.136
And the dean at Berkeley said, well, there's only four universities in the U.S.

01:54.957 --> 02:00.922
that would be open to that kind of thinking that aren't just, you know, dyed in the wool.

02:01.202 --> 02:10.191
And he said Texas A&M and North Carolina State and I think it was Arizona State was one.

02:10.171 --> 02:14.879
And so anyhow, I was saying, I'm from Texas, you know, no better than that.

02:14.899 --> 02:15.641
And he said, no, no.

02:16.442 --> 02:22.432
So I called a friend of mine, Norman Ufer, that I'd worked with at CRS, who was teaching here.

02:22.953 --> 02:26.880
U-F-F-E-R.

02:27.687 --> 02:31.115
And so he arranged an interview.

02:31.155 --> 02:35.927
They were looking for about three people because they had just changed to the 4-2 program.

02:37.070 --> 02:40.057
And Berkeley was one of the ones that had just changed to the 4-2.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.831
So came down to interview and hit it off real well with Romnick and Cecil Stewart.

02:45.811 --> 03:02.015
interviewed and had about a four-hour interview session and he essentially said, you can do anything you want to do, any kind of research, go any kind of directions with your class, we're open to any kind of experimentation.

03:03.638 --> 03:07.043
And all the other schools were like, the dean would say,

03:08.390 --> 03:12.075
I'm the hand and you're the fingers and I'll tell you when to move.

03:12.876 --> 03:15.019
And it was like, I don't think so.

03:15.059 --> 03:17.382
So I came to A&M.

03:18.143 --> 03:19.925
When did you begin?

03:19.965 --> 03:20.906
Fall of 69.

03:22.028 --> 03:24.831
And this is the only dollar question we'll ask.

03:24.952 --> 03:27.134
What was the beginning salary that first year?

03:27.715 --> 03:28.356
Let's see.

03:29.602 --> 03:31.284
It was 10-5.

03:31.304 --> 03:31.624
10-5.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.887
And I was thrilled to get it.

03:33.907 --> 03:36.110
Was that reasonably competitive for that era?

03:36.290 --> 03:43.338
Yeah, nobody was, you know, architect profs, you know, weren't making very much money at the time.

03:44.019 --> 03:49.025
Describe when you came, describe the, where was architecture?

03:49.085 --> 03:50.807
What were its facilities?

03:51.167 --> 03:55.272
Okay, I guess they had facilities built in 1962.

03:55.252 --> 04:15.724
and what we now call Building C. And it was three stories, and then had a little basement, and all of the departments, landscape, architecture, urban and regional planning, construction sites, were all in the same building.

04:16.445 --> 04:18.468
And there were probably 350 students.

04:19.169 --> 04:21.613
About how many faculty?

04:23.163 --> 04:33.139
I don't remember right off the bat, but we could all fit in one apartment when we had Christmas parties and things like that, and everybody got along.

04:33.727 --> 04:44.887
Did anybody in your early weeks or months attempt to assign you to tell you what to do and what not to do, give you any directions?

04:45.127 --> 04:46.990
No, not really.

04:47.371 --> 04:57.709
Norman Ufer and Rusty Bernard, I was teaching with at the second-year level, and they essentially showed me what they did.

04:57.689 --> 05:04.641
But they wanted me to go off my own track so I didn't have to actually, you know, teach what they were doing, which I did.

05:04.701 --> 05:17.503
You know, I did everything from happenings to I had one project where the students designed their own project and had to create something.

05:17.669 --> 05:35.246
We ended up with, like, a guy that was in a band wrote a song and then performed it, you know, for his final project and stuff like that, which, you know, a lot of the old-time faculty there were, you know, arched eyebrows and everything else going, oh, my God.

05:36.107 --> 05:42.934
This is the new group they hired because they hired Jerry Mayfee at the same time, and he was from Berklee also.

05:42.914 --> 05:50.622
And Jerry lives down the street in what I think might have been the commandant's house on campus, has a race stage.

05:51.803 --> 06:02.194
And during the summer, he would walk down in his purple Speedos with a Mickey Mouse watch and yarn holding it on his throat, you know, with Ms.

06:02.254 --> 06:02.975
Wilcox and Ms.

06:03.015 --> 06:06.358
Burgess, you know, peeking out their windows, gasping and ha.

06:07.399 --> 06:11.183
And he had always been raised in Los Angeles, San Francisco area.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.347
And their dog died of heat stroke the first summer here.

06:16.789 --> 06:24.759
And then his kids, the first Christmas they were here, asked for beds because they just laid out pallets on the floor for them.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.344
And they had been invited over to other kids' house for slumber parties.

06:29.945 --> 06:33.829
And they thought, well, they couldn't invite them over to their house unless they had real beds.

06:33.809 --> 06:38.915
So it was it was kind of a fun, of course, being from the Midwest and Texas.

06:40.236 --> 06:44.782
I didn't go through the pallet on the floor and all of that.

06:45.482 --> 06:49.327
How did you how were you and your new colleagues?

06:49.627 --> 06:50.989
How were you received?

06:51.790 --> 06:54.393
Oh, it was welcomed.

06:54.553 --> 07:01.521
John Ferry was here then, and he's been here longer than probably God.

07:01.501 --> 07:09.803
And we got along real well because the students were real excited and they liked that.

07:10.003 --> 07:11.026
You know, the dean liked that.

07:11.206 --> 07:17.603
And the dean would put up with a lot of things as long as the students were excited and learning and enthusiastic.

07:17.583 --> 07:20.772
And we all seemed to click together.

07:21.092 --> 07:33.145
And, you know, over the first three years, I taught everything from, you know, fourth year, third year, second year on, you know, and got along with every year level.

07:33.378 --> 07:40.045
Did that first year, did your, what was the title of the course or courses you were teaching?

07:40.305 --> 07:41.426
It was sophomore design.

07:41.907 --> 07:43.769
Sophomore design.

07:43.969 --> 07:45.050
Sophomore design.

07:45.090 --> 07:45.370
Right.

07:46.251 --> 07:47.733
It was second level design.

07:47.933 --> 07:48.874
Okay.

07:48.894 --> 07:50.556
And how many students?

07:51.237 --> 07:52.978
Describe the course and how you did it.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.300
I had about 15 students.

07:55.661 --> 07:59.385
And we also, at that point in time, we had,

07:59.365 --> 08:12.603
a whole bunch of, for some reason, New York people and New Jersey people that were transferring into A&M because it was cheaper for them to pay out of state tuition and go to A&M than to stay in New York.

08:13.504 --> 08:22.656
So we had a crew of around seven to ten students between three sections that were from Yankee land.

08:22.636 --> 08:32.987
They were in there and they had come from two years junior college of a strict drafting, you know, T-score triangle, you know, inked stuff.

08:33.548 --> 08:46.181
And then they were thrown into our classes where we were doing things like ergonomics and design your own dill and some fairly free things.

08:47.082 --> 08:51.647
And Windler was part of that crew.

08:51.627 --> 08:52.608
that was here at the time.

08:53.049 --> 08:54.651
Walter Windler, future dean.

08:57.575 --> 09:03.523
What about the, how did the typical Aggie student strike you as a Red Raider?

09:03.763 --> 09:07.548
We had a lot of core types, you know, that were in there.

09:08.549 --> 09:12.815
In fact, it seemed like some of the classes seemed to be half and half, you know, core.

09:13.696 --> 09:16.420
And if you had a female, it was rare.

09:17.561 --> 09:21.246
It was like one, you know, female out of a class.

09:22.002 --> 09:28.953
But A&M and Tech students have pretty much the same work ethic.

09:28.973 --> 09:41.752
And like even with Texas Society of Architects committees I've been on, and when we have student charrettes and participation, the only two groups you can count on in the state are Texas Tech and Texas A&M.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.197
As far as participation are really being gung-ho.

09:46.339 --> 09:50.946
They're slowly, you know, taking over, you know, all the different committees and hierarchy.

09:50.926 --> 09:57.455
Rice, you can't ever get to participate at all in anything.

09:58.877 --> 10:10.673
Texas usually participates, but not necessarily, and Houston occasionally, but that's changed because they have an Aggie Dean now, and he's forcing them to participate.

10:11.834 --> 10:17.504
Did that first year, did they tease you or anything about not being an Aggie?

10:17.524 --> 10:18.245
Did the students?

10:18.986 --> 10:19.407
Not really.

10:20.309 --> 10:20.469
Okay.

10:20.509 --> 10:24.075
In fact, let's see, was it McIntyre, Bill McIntyre.

10:24.396 --> 10:25.919
He was a sophomore at the time.

10:26.580 --> 10:28.303
And at that point in time, I was still 29.

10:28.503 --> 10:33.452
And he was the underground editor.

10:33.612 --> 10:35.395
You remember the underground newspapers then?

10:35.375 --> 10:40.282
And he was trying to keep it real quiet, you know, that he was the underground editor.

10:41.104 --> 10:45.831
And so he would come by and confide in me and tell me all these things and stuff.

10:46.372 --> 10:52.000
And so my birthday happened that April and somebody, you know, one of the secretaries had a

10:51.980 --> 10:52.942
cake and all that.

10:53.142 --> 10:54.746
And he said, well, how old are you?

10:55.267 --> 10:56.790
And I said, well, I'm now 30.

10:56.810 --> 11:00.577
And he just went sullen then.

11:00.597 --> 11:03.363
You know, he just never talked to me again because I was over 30.

11:03.784 --> 11:05.046
You remember from the Berkeley guy?

11:05.547 --> 11:07.130
He said, don't trust anybody over 30.

11:07.150 --> 11:12.942
Well, he decided that I had turned the corner and couldn't be trusted anymore.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.764
But he was in that group.

11:15.044 --> 11:18.608
And you've seen copies of the battalion, I guess, haven't you?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.952
I was thinking of bringing that, but I figured you probably already have copies.

11:22.953 --> 11:29.160
But there were a lot of interesting stories around that time when Dean Hannigan was dean of men.

11:30.161 --> 11:35.807
He ran the place with an iron fist.

11:37.137 --> 11:43.748
Robert Riggs, you know, who's got the Pulitzer Prize and all sorts of things.

11:44.910 --> 11:49.818
He and John Sharp and Caperton and all that crew were in faculty senate together.

11:50.559 --> 12:03.280
But the three of them, just one funny story about the faculty senate, the student senate, for grins because it was so boring and so trite and so predictable, they would get together in the back

12:03.783 --> 12:13.354
and then propose different amendments or new things that should be passed, like, why does Aggie Sweetheart have to be a woman?

12:14.075 --> 12:15.897
We think we should open it up to both sexes.

12:16.438 --> 12:23.186
And then they would sit back and then just let the faculty senate just go into an outrage, you know, and scream and yell, and they would sit in the back and chuckle.

12:23.526 --> 12:32.997
Then the next month they'd say, we would like to change the mascot from Reveille to, you know, something more befitting a school of our, you know, and then,

12:32.977 --> 12:36.681
Everyone just going to, you know, delirium treatments about it.

12:37.422 --> 12:38.484
But Riggs was funny then.

12:38.544 --> 12:43.049
But he would feed me stuff from around the campus.

12:43.289 --> 12:49.257
And I think it was the president of the student body's brother.

12:50.058 --> 12:54.563
Anyhow, the president of the student body had stood up against Hannigan about some things.

12:54.543 --> 13:05.596
and that he thought he was being a little too dictatorial with the students and da-da-da, and was trying to bring some of it to the Senate.

13:05.616 --> 13:14.766
And Hannigan, and he, unbeknownst to Hannigan, this guy had been dating the receptionist over in the police deal.

13:16.008 --> 13:23.436
So anyhow, he got this frantic phone call, he was still in his dorm room, hadn't gone to class, from her saying,

13:23.416 --> 13:35.552
She had monitored a call because she heard the name, and so she clicked into it, and they had planted marijuana in two areas of the kids' room.

13:36.308 --> 13:37.270
So she told him.

13:37.791 --> 13:52.637
So he went dashing over, he knew where the kid brother was, got him out of class, they ran back to his dorm room and they went to the exact two spots where they said it was and pulled baggies out and ran and flushed them and then had the kid go back to class and he went to class.

13:53.278 --> 14:01.472
And then the roommate was still there, so the roommate was there when Hannigan's group came in and they went right to those two spots.

14:01.807 --> 14:04.233
And it was interesting.

14:04.473 --> 14:11.108
And then Harry Need, who's from Delaware, was a construction science student, a wrestler on the wrestling team.

14:11.990 --> 14:12.952
And big guy.

14:13.013 --> 14:17.202
And he was on the dorm wing of one of the dorms.

14:17.222 --> 14:20.710
He was like wing counselor or whatever it is.

14:20.690 --> 14:33.529
Anyhow, the rules were if they were coming to arrest a student, they first had to go see the head guy and then go up to the wing advisor and then to the kid's room.

14:33.789 --> 14:41.641
Well, Harry happened to be up late one night doing some architecture or something and went out in the hall and he saw these two policemen coming.

14:42.242 --> 14:45.567
And he thought, well, they're coming to see me and they passed right by him.

14:45.648 --> 14:47.391
And one of them said, get back in your room.

14:47.652 --> 14:50.517
And he said, I'm the wing advisor here.

14:51.138 --> 14:52.140
Can you tell me what's going on?

14:53.141 --> 14:56.167
And they said, it's none of your business.

14:56.307 --> 14:57.810
And he said, yes, it is.

14:58.491 --> 15:00.815
Because did you go down and check with da, da, da, da?

15:00.835 --> 15:03.640
And they said, go back to your room or we'll place you under arrest.

15:03.620 --> 15:10.514
So they went and knocked on the guy's room, and Harry did the squissel bit and brought everybody out into the floor.

15:11.436 --> 15:16.006
And then Harry stationed himself at the head of the stairs, and he's a formidable guy.

15:17.108 --> 15:20.996
And the two policemen came with the guy between them and said, get out of our way.

15:21.016 --> 15:21.898
And he said, no.

15:21.878 --> 15:25.922
He said, not one of you or two of you collectively can move me.

15:26.943 --> 15:32.328
And it's just one of you downstairs, go through the proper channels and then you can come back.

15:33.549 --> 15:40.896
So one of them in disgust went downstairs and Harry in the meantime sent two of his guys down who let all the air out of the police towers.

15:42.958 --> 15:50.805
But Harry is now head of a nuclear facility plant, I think in Mississippi.

15:51.427 --> 15:55.194
And so anyhow, Harry, after that, Hannigan sent people to trail him.

15:56.297 --> 15:58.260
And Harry had a date up at North Texas.

15:58.641 --> 16:03.210
They trailed him to North Texas in this unmarked white car, you know, followed him around the estate.

16:04.152 --> 16:06.036
Harry was invited out to a ranch at Caldwell.

16:06.156 --> 16:08.220
They parked outside the ranch gate.

16:08.504 --> 16:11.909
until he left again, and then they had somebody tail him on campus.

16:12.549 --> 16:28.070
So, Harry was getting tired of this, so he had a battalion and a piece of lead pipe rolled up, and he cut across into the, what's now civil engineering, when it had the arches on it, and just waited till the guy went by and went clunk, and they quit following him.

16:30.033 --> 16:36.081
But that was Riggs and Harry Knead and Sharp and all that bunch were about that time.

16:36.584 --> 16:47.990
During that first year or so, what was your philosophy, your intent as a new faculty member?

16:48.050 --> 16:50.356
What were your guiding principles and attitudes?

16:51.859 --> 16:54.525
I was just trying to get students to discover themselves.

16:54.505 --> 17:00.430
and what they could do that they could do anything and get them to unlock their creativity.

17:01.491 --> 17:22.470
So that was my whole intent, you know, and I was having them read a lot of books on psychology and philosophy and things like that that weren't architectural driven and a lot of self-discovery, you know, type stuff and then I started getting into

17:22.450 --> 17:30.899
I was looking at some of the Olympic things they did with progressive relaxation that gets a person into the zone and creativity.

17:31.400 --> 17:36.205
When you get into optimum behavior, it's the same difference getting into that area.

17:36.786 --> 17:45.935
And so I was practicing with them doing some of these optimum behavior, you know, progressive relaxations, and I'd turn off the lights and have them laying on top of their desk.

17:47.938 --> 17:52.002
And then we would go through some visualization exercises.

17:51.982 --> 17:57.293
and going through all five senses and all of that, which was fun.

17:57.353 --> 18:07.073
You know, the best, you know, the thing that you do is lock the doors and put your paper so, you know, people weren't looking in and bothering you.

18:07.755 --> 18:12.184
Did anybody in the architecture faculty

18:12.164 --> 18:14.869
ever tease or chuckle about?

18:14.989 --> 18:22.143
Not really, because when they got my students the next semester, they were better than the students they'd gotten before.

18:24.307 --> 18:25.429
They were able to focus.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.435
You know, like one of them was commenting on

18:28.415 --> 18:33.846
he would walk up to this guy and start chatting with him about his project, and the guy didn't respond, he just kept doing it.

18:33.866 --> 18:43.887
He was able to focus so much that he wasn't cognizant of the prof. And the prof had to do this, which the prof thought was great, that the guy was able to focus that much.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.976
And they seemed to be able to achieve a whole lot more

18:48.293 --> 18:53.601
And I get feedback all the time, even from, you know, 30 years back.

18:53.661 --> 18:58.809
A student that hadn't been around in 30 years will come back and say, you remember those things you did?

18:58.829 --> 19:00.391
So I still use them.

19:00.411 --> 19:07.782
You know, they may not use the same architectural techniques and stuff, but they use the thinking skills part.

19:08.002 --> 19:16.495
In that first year or so, did you have any dream as to where you would spend most of your professional career?

19:16.475 --> 19:18.919
Did you think you were going to be here very long?

19:18.939 --> 19:20.241
No, not really.

19:20.902 --> 19:29.895
Actually, a guy named John Perry and myself worked together at Kenneth Vincent's in Houston, and he took off for Columbia when I took off for Berkeley.

19:30.375 --> 19:35.463
And we were thinking of coming back and teaching at U of H and setting up a practice.

19:36.705 --> 19:40.811
And U of H was, I mean, what a grim program they had.

19:41.652 --> 19:44.997
And then after about a year here,

19:45.196 --> 19:51.623
I was so hooked on teaching, you know, that that just completely went out of my mind.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.138
And then the more I talked to profs at other universities,

19:55.861 --> 20:02.289
the more I figured I had this, you know, incredible honeymoon that's going on that's never stopped.

20:03.330 --> 20:19.270
When did you, during that first year or so, what kind of evaluation process or advising did anyone in the, at the departmental or college level give you to let you know whether you were making progress or not?

20:19.250 --> 20:22.296
other than Alan Staisal being the department head.

20:22.637 --> 20:23.579
Did he try, did he?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.565
He was always positive.

20:27.246 --> 20:30.413
And then the students were always, you know, doing positive things.

20:30.493 --> 20:33.900
I mean they would do really crazy things like

20:35.669 --> 20:38.053
Well, everyone was friends there.

20:38.073 --> 20:40.016
I mean, the department head, the students, the whole bit.

20:40.497 --> 20:52.778
But, like, Alan went out to lunch one day, and it was around Christmas time, and I had come into class and I'd given a particularly strenuous project to the students who had been up all night working on it and they were in a crazy mood.

20:53.359 --> 20:58.909
So they grabbed me from behind, tied me up, and then wrapped me with wrapping paper and a big bow.

20:58.889 --> 21:02.936
and carried me down and put me on Alan Stasel's desk waiting for him to come back for lunch.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.607
So, you know, things like that were going on, which Alan loved.

21:08.627 --> 21:10.490
He liked students being involved in things.

21:11.733 --> 21:16.842
And I'm assuming that that was, you did not think that was unusual for architecture students.

21:16.942 --> 21:17.944
No.

21:17.924 --> 21:23.314
And let's sidetrack now about moving here.

21:24.156 --> 21:26.240
You were married when you got here.

21:27.102 --> 21:30.609
Describe what it was like to move to College Station.

21:31.130 --> 21:31.691
From Berkeley.

21:31.931 --> 21:34.937
What kind of housing did you find and so forth?

21:34.917 --> 21:37.520
Well, there was no housing.

21:37.540 --> 21:44.168
You know, I got here interviewed, I guess in July, sort of looked around, couldn't find anything.

21:45.370 --> 21:50.456
We moved back to an apartment we had sublet in Houston, and we used that as headquarters to come back.

21:51.958 --> 22:00.688
And Sue had commented the first time she was in College Station, we were waiting to get into a public pay phone to phone a realtor.

22:01.580 --> 22:06.649
And there was a guy with an Aggie ring going like this, and she went, oh, all the stories are true.

22:07.370 --> 22:15.384
You know, and so anyhow, she gave up after, because we just had a kid that was born in January.

22:16.867 --> 22:20.533
So he was about six months old, Bunker.

22:23.973 --> 22:25.094
She sent me up to look.

22:26.115 --> 22:28.758
So I happened to be just driving up and down the street.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.140
I thought, well, what can I do?

22:30.901 --> 22:37.849
I'll just move until I found something.

22:38.329 --> 22:43.415
So I just happened to drive along Lee, right by the campus, thinking I wanted to find anything there.

22:43.455 --> 22:48.241
And there was a guy just setting a sign out in his front yard.

22:49.082 --> 22:52.005
And this was two weeks before school started.

22:52.745 --> 22:56.031
And so I stopped, and it was a computer science prop.

22:56.612 --> 22:59.657
And Texas Instruments had just made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

23:00.298 --> 23:03.003
And, of course, that was just a no-no two weeks before school started.

23:03.043 --> 23:04.265
I mean, you left him stranded.

23:04.947 --> 23:06.489
So he wanted out of town fast.

23:07.431 --> 23:13.041
And asking whatever he paid for it, he said, I could have it at that no profit.

23:13.482 --> 23:14.263
He just went out.

23:15.695 --> 23:19.844
So we bought the house, which we hadn't planned it to because I hadn't planned on staying here.

23:20.305 --> 23:23.070
We were planning on renting, but this was cheaper.

23:24.133 --> 23:28.462
Had there been apartments for rent, which there weren't, it was cheaper than renting an apartment.

23:28.482 --> 23:29.364
Now, where was it?

23:30.025 --> 23:30.185
Lee.

23:30.426 --> 23:31.709
It's right by the old Rudder house.

23:33.532 --> 23:36.218
And so anyhow, we bought it.

23:36.670 --> 23:44.901
And, of course, we pulled up in a yellow ochre van, you know, from Berkeley, with Miss Burgess in the front yard just about to faint.

23:47.764 --> 23:51.209
Going to kill Hersha, because he'd given us the loan.

23:52.690 --> 23:56.676
So, for about a couple years, she didn't speak.

23:57.577 --> 23:59.459
Now, what about the rest of the neighborhood?

24:00.681 --> 24:02.884
It was all faculty.

24:02.904 --> 24:04.045
It was called Dean's Row.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.747
then and the Wilcox's lived across the street and they were the nicest people.

24:08.767 --> 24:11.331
I mean, they constantly were over advising.

24:11.452 --> 24:16.240
He was a plant person and so was I. And so we were constantly back and forth.

24:17.642 --> 24:20.707
And then Miss Russell lived across the street to the right.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.590
I think her husband was in sociology.

24:23.397 --> 24:26.261
And then Sadie Hatfield was down a couple of houses.

24:27.302 --> 24:28.463
And Ms.

24:28.503 --> 24:33.289
Ratcliffe lived next door, and her husband was the USDA, I believe.

24:34.571 --> 24:36.153
But they were really nice.

24:36.173 --> 24:37.334
The Cartwrights were there.

24:38.956 --> 24:41.880
Herman Brown lived catty corner over there.

24:42.881 --> 24:45.625
So they were all pleasant.

24:45.645 --> 24:48.528
They referred to the house as the house the Angels built.

24:49.249 --> 24:51.632
Dean Angel had built my house.

24:51.612 --> 25:07.663
And so we had to repaint it, and so we painted it yellow, you know, with, I forgot what color shutters, green shutters, and they were all just said, it's always been white with blue shutters, with white flowers out front, you know, and they were just horrified.

25:08.437 --> 25:15.927
And then I had started to plant some fast growing trees out front and the Wilcox's came over and said, no, no, no, no, no.

25:15.947 --> 25:18.650
It's always live oaks on this street, you know, that you have to plant.

25:18.830 --> 25:23.716
So we ended up planting live oaks, but they were always charming.

25:23.877 --> 25:24.537
They're really nice.

25:25.118 --> 25:34.410
And at that point in time, the neighborhood transition was there were, there was one rent house down the way that had some young kids in it and then ours.

25:35.774 --> 25:40.700
And then Mike Moore lived next door, and he had seven kids, but moved in about five years.

25:40.780 --> 25:42.422
But those were the only kids in the neighborhood.

25:43.664 --> 25:51.574
And now it's sort of, you know, gone full circle, and there's tons of kids, and the houses are being bought and sold.

25:51.614 --> 25:53.857
It's probably the only really good investment we've ever made.

25:54.197 --> 25:58.923
All right, when you got in, did y'all, are y'all churchgoers?

25:59.964 --> 26:01.887
And what, how did you get?

26:02.327 --> 26:05.511
Well, the scary thing was I happened to open up the Yellow Pages,

26:05.491 --> 26:13.586
and came running in to Sue saying, oh my God, over 50% of all the churches here are Baptist.

26:13.607 --> 26:15.550
And we'd already been, you know, like Ms.

26:15.570 --> 26:18.656
Burgess was already going like, we're not Baptist.

26:19.598 --> 26:24.327
It's like, oh dear, are we going to be part of the victims of the Baptist Mafia?

26:24.897 --> 26:25.578
But Ms.

26:25.618 --> 26:40.631
Wilcox and a bunch of them would always come over and give us these horror stories of the terrible people in Bryan and that we should be careful of Bryan people and all that because all they want to do is use College Station to milk all the money out of them.

26:41.232 --> 26:54.904
And those terrible boyettes and all those different people said, you know, they raised the prices up and said, they'll wait and take a trip into Houston every month to stock up so they don't have to buy from the Bryan people.

26:54.884 --> 26:57.586
And, you know, carried that myth on.

26:57.626 --> 27:01.950
And then the same with the school district and, you know, the whole bit.

27:02.691 --> 27:03.592
So you all joined where?

27:03.812 --> 27:04.252
What church?

27:05.033 --> 27:05.213
St.

27:05.233 --> 27:05.914
Thomas Episcopal.

27:07.255 --> 27:11.499
And describe that congregation at that time.

27:11.519 --> 27:12.219
Oh, they were very nice.

27:12.259 --> 27:18.325
David Woodcock was in it, you know, and Father Oxley, you know.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.567
And where did you all do your shopping that first year or so?

27:22.869 --> 27:24.570
Well, grocery, of course, here.

27:24.550 --> 27:26.053
We'd usually go into Houston.

27:26.073 --> 27:30.420
But there weren't any grocery stores in College Station then to speak of.

27:31.802 --> 27:35.448
There was a Piggly Wiggly down where, roughly where Academy was.

27:37.211 --> 27:38.353
And then let's see, what was here?

27:38.914 --> 27:40.517
There was a Whataburger.

27:40.852 --> 27:46.157
And then there was that funny little stone place down across from where it was chicken.

27:46.257 --> 27:46.698
Youngbloods.

27:46.798 --> 27:47.578
Youngbloods, yeah.

27:48.179 --> 27:58.649
And then when they built the Dairy Queen on the outskirts of town, we never could figure out why they would build it so far out of town, which is really funny.

27:58.669 --> 28:01.872
But as a result, we were members of a garment club in Houston.

28:03.013 --> 28:09.880
And so when we got here and we looked at what was available bakery wise, everything else wise,

28:10.636 --> 28:25.707
We started chatting with a bunch of our friends, and so Bill Sackett and Ann Sackett and John and Jane Huey, a guy that was head of journalism at that point in time.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.148
Lebo?

28:26.429 --> 28:27.070
Lebo, yeah.

28:27.090 --> 28:28.493
Skip Lebo, L-E-A-B-O.

28:28.473 --> 28:28.934
You're right.

28:29.174 --> 28:33.401
He and his wife and Steve Ryder and Eve Ryder.

28:35.845 --> 28:38.669
We all joined together and formed the first Gourmet Club.

28:39.170 --> 28:40.412
The first meeting was at our house.

28:41.875 --> 28:43.597
And now it's grown to like 50 couples.

28:44.839 --> 28:48.405
But we jumped out of it in about the 80s because it had gotten too big.

28:48.773 --> 28:52.521
Now, did y'all, would y'all eat out together, or you... Oh, no.

28:52.842 --> 28:55.307
You took turns... I mean, there was no place to eat.

28:55.327 --> 28:56.390
You took turns hosting?

28:56.670 --> 28:57.191
Right, yeah.

28:57.211 --> 29:03.044
We would research menus of different countries, and then we would assign different people different tasks.

29:03.064 --> 29:05.329
They would all meet together and have a gourmet meal.

29:05.349 --> 29:05.850
Once a month?

29:06.792 --> 29:08.436
It's probably once every two months.

29:09.479 --> 29:12.206
And then we've pared it down to the sides.

29:12.226 --> 29:24.838
It's Abe and Ruth Clairfield, the Parsons many, and Gary Halter and his wife, and then Jane Huey.

29:24.818 --> 29:30.669
You all became part of the community feeling very comfortable and so forth.

29:30.689 --> 29:31.550
Oh yeah.

29:31.891 --> 29:45.595
During your first year or two did students ever play, you said they wrapped you up as a president one time, any other Aggie jokes that you, or Ag Good Bull that you witnessed in architecture or elsewhere?

29:45.836 --> 29:46.257
Oh sure.

29:47.098 --> 29:48.160
Examples.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.801
The panels, for one.

29:50.302 --> 29:51.123
The what?

29:51.143 --> 29:52.384
A&M Centennial panels.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.065
Oh, well, no, that's not good bull, though.

29:54.085 --> 29:56.867
I'm talking about jokes, pranks.

29:56.887 --> 30:01.431
Well, see, I spent lots of time over in the cord arms gathering up information.

30:01.491 --> 30:10.599
So to get things like Popeye and swirlies and all that stuff, I had to have them decipher what all these things were and to fill me in.

30:11.159 --> 30:17.725
So they filled me in on three or four things that were less than kosher that were

30:17.705 --> 30:21.031
you know, triple X-rated, which I didn't know, you know.

30:21.712 --> 30:29.465
And I would put them in there and fortunately somebody on the Board of Regents caught it and said, there's four things you need to take out, you know.

30:29.925 --> 30:31.488
But that was a trick they pulled.

30:32.350 --> 30:43.408
There was a, let's say, a very elaborate prank the students pulled because we all would have parties and the students and the faculty would all go together because we were small.

30:43.388 --> 30:50.320
So this one particular class, I was trying to think, it was Mad Max Greiner was in that bunch.

30:50.821 --> 30:51.442
I think he was.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.088
But Max did the 12th man statue.

30:55.949 --> 31:00.196
But they did a—you need to change the tape?

31:00.216 --> 31:01.819
No, I'm getting close.

31:01.799 --> 31:12.229
We had a party at Jerry Maffey's house, which would hold Jerry Maffey, M-A-F-F-E-I, and Marvin Rowe, if you know him, he's a cosmic chemist.

31:13.050 --> 31:15.072
He was there, but there was a huge group there.

31:15.092 --> 31:16.614
There must have been 60 people there.

31:16.754 --> 31:17.535
Romnick was there.

31:18.275 --> 31:19.136
Staisa was there.

31:19.937 --> 31:22.479
And the students decided to play a big prank on Jerry.

31:23.841 --> 31:25.002
So they were going to stage a murder.

31:25.522 --> 31:27.064
They had a stage pistol.

31:27.550 --> 31:32.988
And so they had this guy coming in with his date and then another guy trying to hit on her.

31:33.911 --> 31:35.456
And they were being real loud.

31:35.737 --> 31:37.061
We thought it was real obvious.

31:37.643 --> 31:38.767
But nobody else did.

31:38.787 --> 31:39.670
They thought it won't come.
