WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:07.715
I'm Richard Dick Buck Wirus Lund. All those names 
are somewhere involved with me because I was born

00:07.735 --> 00:19.327
Richard Wirus Lund in August the 29th, 1920, in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. And as a child, I was

00:20.489 --> 00:23.472
called Sonny. I was called Richard. And then in 
school, I was called Dick. In high school, through

00:29.545 --> 00:37.397
various songs and funny things of my stature, the 
name Buck came up. It was a derivative of Buckskin,

00:37.477 --> 00:41.583
which was a little song in those days. But anyway, 
that's not necessary for this purpose. But

00:45.468 --> 00:47.471
anyway, the name Buck came up. And then at A&M, I was 
called Buck for the last couple of years because

00:47.512 --> 00:58.708
it's always Fishwires, or Fish Jones, Fish 
Detloff, in the early part of your college career.

01:02.520 --> 01:06.004
But the Lund is... Lund is my father's name. 
L-U-N-D. D. Uh-huh. L-U-N-D. And he came from

01:08.407 --> 01:15.157
Dawson, Minnesota, and my mother came from Thief 
River Falls, Minnesota. She was born in Eau

01:15.757 --> 01:19.242
Claire, Wisconsin, but she was raised... Her 
father, my grandfather, Wyrus, was a railroad

01:19.262 --> 01:24.429
man, the Sioux Line Railroad. His family had come 
from Alsace, and they had been brewmasters and

01:29.198 --> 01:31.901
winemakers and so on. But when he got to Wisconsin, 
somehow or another, he didn't continue in that. He

01:39.370 --> 01:45.458
got into the railroad business and built 
cofferdams for bridges and so on. But anyway, the

01:45.478 --> 01:50.263
name Wirus was this name. My mother and father were 
divorced in 1923, which was unusual for those

01:50.644 --> 01:55.770
days. My mother was an early woman's libber. And 
she had me by court decree. So I lived with her

02:02.223 --> 02:05.828
family most of the time until 1934. And that was, I 
lived with an Indian family. And you were where in

02:09.854 --> 02:11.557
Minnesota? In Minnesota, in Minneapolis. 
Minneapolis. And I lived with an Indian family.

02:17.665 --> 02:19.849
And they were Chippewa Indians. And she was a 
nurse, and they were off the reservation. But they

02:24.115 --> 02:25.978
did Chautauquas. And he played football with Jim 
Thorpe. at Carlisle. And of course I learned a lot

02:29.517 --> 02:34.403
of Indian lore because they did Chautauquas. And I 
got to be in those Chautauquas and had a little suit

02:35.245 --> 02:40.952
and we did the different dances. Oh, we know. But 
this is a side of you I never knew. That's

02:43.436 --> 02:43.856
interesting. And it was real interesting for me. 
My first memory of it was at Prior Lake and there was

02:46.780 --> 02:52.248
a group of Indians there. And these people of 
course were all educated, but they were like you

02:56.864 --> 02:58.706
would imagine they were quite clannish. And I 
remember Maude, their name was P-E-A-K-E, was

02:58.726 --> 03:04.954
their American. His Indian name was Chief Little 
Moose. And of course, squaws didn't seem to get

03:09.320 --> 03:15.467
those exotic names like Little Moose. Did you keep 
contact with those people over? Yes, I did. The

03:19.813 --> 03:23.958
last one I have is a girl my age. She graduated from 
the University of Minnesota. and worked for the

03:27.104 --> 03:30.108
Ford Motor Company there in Minneapolis for many, 
many years. And I kept up with her until about 10, 12

03:30.148 --> 03:33.914
years ago. And her Indian name was Abidu. Abidu. 
P-E-A-K-E. But there were two families, two

03:39.923 --> 03:45.551
brothers, and I kept in touch with the brothers' 
family. No. Louise, yeah. Yeah, Louise Peake was

03:49.096 --> 03:54.443
the sister-in-law of the family that I grew up 
with. Anyway, I was there until to Lindbergh

03:56.078 --> 04:17.648
across the ocean that was in 1926 and 27 and then my 
mother moved me she got she got ill in Chicago my

03:56.078 --> 04:17.648
grandpa I went down I was there almost a school year 
went to kindergarten in Chicago and my

03:56.078 --> 04:17.648
grandfather took me then to the farm in Wisconsin 
uh Colfax Wisconsin which is near Eau Claire,

04:18.252 --> 04:23.337
Menominee, and Chippewa Falls, it's due east of 
Minneapolis about 75 miles. Now it would be out

04:23.617 --> 04:26.280
that interstate that goes east out of 
Minneapolis. Yeah, I think I've taken that.

04:27.421 --> 04:28.822
Uh-huh. It goes right by Menominee and Eau Claire. 
Chippewa Falls sits off to the left. Yeah, to the

04:33.626 --> 04:33.987
left. That's pretty country. Oh, it's just 
beautiful. And of course, I was living in heaven. A

04:38.951 --> 04:43.516
little kid, 14 years old, finished the eighth 
grade in a one-room school. The closest paved road

04:44.737 --> 04:47.159
was about 12 miles away. It would be Menominee. all 
the other roads were dirt roads. They were county

04:50.066 --> 04:51.868
roads and township roads. We had a township road, 
which got a grader about every six months. The rest

04:56.332 --> 05:00.857
of it was just old dust and gravel, you know.

05:04.662 --> 05:05.462
And this is interesting. There was a one-room 
building, and these schools were scattered just

05:05.482 --> 05:11.970
about two to four miles apart. The teachers were 
normal school educated. They had two years, but

05:15.034 --> 05:18.700
all of them had taken special music. They taught 
everything from music and drama to agriculture

05:19.422 --> 05:23.889
and sports. And she was a Norwegian lady, Minda 
Berg was her name, lived to be 92 or 93 years old,

05:23.909 --> 05:30.980
died a couple of years ago. But you talk about 
excellence in education, there were an average of

05:31.521 --> 05:38.192
30 children in that I'm going to meet with my 
classmates this summer. In that school? Is that

05:41.427 --> 05:42.348
right? We're going to have a little reunion up on a 
farm there near Menominee. She had all eight

05:49.040 --> 05:50.343
grades. All the kids got to walk to school at least a 
mile, except me. I lived across the road, so that

05:54.510 --> 06:01.783
made me the janitor, for which I got paid 25 cents a 
day, and they thought that was too much. So they

06:02.202 --> 06:04.846
reduced my salary to 15 cents a day. I swept the 
school and dusted and then had to clean the

06:04.866 --> 06:11.276
blackboards and build the fire. Now, the other 
boys put the wood down the chute to the furnace. We

06:15.703 --> 06:17.326
didn't have a furnace in the basement. No plumbing 
and no electricity. And so we had outdoor back

06:18.968 --> 06:23.436
houses and we had great windows. It was cold in the 
wintertime.

06:27.923 --> 06:28.103
Yeah. Then they set up the fire for me. And all I came 
in the morning was going to put kerosene on the wood

06:30.468 --> 06:35.296
and then set the fire. Went and did my milking, just 
about 100 yards away from my house to the school.

06:41.406 --> 06:46.114
And then after a milking, usually four cows was 
about mine at that age. I got the easy milkers, so my

06:47.156 --> 06:50.001
uncle took the heifers. They're the hardest ones. 
But we didn't have a milking machine. Of course,

06:53.206 --> 06:54.889
now everything is electric. automated. And it's 
these farms. Did he run a dairy? It was a dairy,

06:59.371 --> 07:01.855
Guernsey Cattle. So we had to study agriculture, 
one of the courses. But she did about 20

07:04.699 --> 07:07.143
recitations a day. And those recitations seemed 
to me averaged between, say, 10 and 20 minutes. But

07:11.710 --> 07:13.032
I can't remember. But I remember everybody had at 
least, oh, eight grades. We'd have two or so

07:18.541 --> 07:21.906
recitations every day. And of course a lot of our 
work in arithmetic was done at the blackboard.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.475
Which kept you on your toes. You couldn't doze in 
class. We did all our studying there. I never

07:31.960 --> 07:34.523
studied at home. I didn't have anybody really to 
help me at home. My uncle did finish high school,

07:36.867 --> 07:40.391
but my grandparents hadn't. He was busy with women 
and things like that. So I didn't have any help at

07:45.258 --> 07:46.780
home. But anyway, this group, all six of us that 
finished eighth grade in 1934 are living. All of us

07:53.279 --> 07:54.761
finished college. And we were quite successful. 
Everett Iverson, the man I'm going to meet this

07:58.064 --> 08:03.110
summer, was head of instruction. Ran through 
Illinois, Scott Air Force Base, the training for

08:03.130 --> 08:07.454
Air Force technicians. And his cousin, who was the 
grade behind us, was superintendent of schools

08:08.415 --> 08:15.062
over in Pontiac, Michigan. Anyway. That's 
interesting. Yeah. But you've even kept that

08:18.229 --> 08:19.990
contact. It's incredible. Well, I've kept 
contact with people. See, because everywhere I

08:22.793 --> 08:25.255
met, everyone was my family. I didn't really have a 
family at home. I've never really had. For

08:29.039 --> 08:32.562
example, my family in my later years were high 
school and Texas A&M. That's why I've been such a

08:32.803 --> 08:39.889
devoted former student, that I immediately found 
friends. And then in 1934, when I finished the

08:40.029 --> 08:42.872
eighth grade, My mother wanted me to come to Texas 
to be with her. She said the reason for that was that

08:47.358 --> 08:51.662
I wouldn't know I had a mother, which is quite true. 
How'd she get to Texas? She came here selling

08:53.824 --> 08:56.327
knitback hose mending machines. And silk hosiery 
was the fashion in those days, and they were quite

08:56.827 --> 09:01.192
expensive. A good pair of silk hose would be, 
average price, about $12.50. And if a woman

09:04.235 --> 09:13.905
snagged it like they would a nylon today, then they 
could afford to pay $1 or $0.50 or $1 to get it fixed.

09:13.936 --> 09:24.548
And this hose mending machine, you could also do it 
by hand, had a little latched hook, and you could

09:13.936 --> 09:24.548
hook into the runner and knit it back right up to the 
top. And then with a fine silk thread, you could do

09:24.568 --> 09:33.358
an invisible mend behind it that you couldn't see 
once the lady had put the hoser back on her feet. And

09:33.398 --> 09:39.865
these machines were small, intricate machines 
and took a lot of training. So when she sold a

09:39.905 --> 09:41.327
machine, She had to stay to train people on it and so 
on. And so she was way ahead of her time. She sold

09:47.487 --> 09:51.832
paint, DuPont, Valentine. She really was, yeah. 
I've got a picture of her painting the Ford in 1926,

09:53.615 --> 09:59.021
Model T Ford, well, black, of course. Oh, yeah. But 
they could paint them with a brush because the

10:00.303 --> 10:06.971
paint wouldn't, that Duco paint was good. So 
anyway. uh so i came to texas in 1934. and we're in

10:08.003 --> 10:36.103
san antonio uh-huh she was set up in the old hicks 
building which was on the corner of broadway and

10:08.003 --> 10:36.103
houston on the third floor and had uh oh three girls 
doing re-weaving she got that franchise from

10:08.003 --> 10:36.103
washington they see a friend of hers a friend of 
theirs had this uh process of taking threads or

10:08.003 --> 10:36.103
material from the garment and re-weaving the 
whole or damaged anything from a bullet hole to a

10:36.488 --> 10:50.207
cigarette burn, usually on new clothes or good 
clothes, because you were using new threads from

10:36.488 --> 10:50.207
the chin seams and lapels, and if it was worn too 
much, it would show. The new threads would show

10:50.227 --> 10:52.790
against the worn threads. So new, good clothes, 
but it was difficult to do. It's a lost art now.

10:58.398 --> 11:00.561
There's only one girl. I sold the business when I 
moved to A&M in 1961. which was involved in a mail

11:04.096 --> 11:06.459
order business. And we did it for the tailors and 
better stores. I say better stores because a less

11:10.545 --> 11:16.533
expensive suit's not worth spending $5, $10 to get 
it rewoven. So anyway, I did her pickup and

11:17.574 --> 11:21.379
deliveries. That was my first job in San Antonio 
was to, my allowance was based on my pickup and

11:21.399 --> 11:29.530
deliveries every day, which I walked down Houston 
Street over to, to the ladies' stores on Houston

11:30.488 --> 11:38.397
Street, to Sears up to Joski's, and the men's 
stores on Alamo Plaza, after school. And of course

11:39.037 --> 11:44.924
when I got in the ROTC we had drum corps and drill 
practice after school. What school did you go to?

11:45.965 --> 11:47.587
Central Catholic High School. I was very unhappy 
when I got there. My next question, I'm going to ask

11:50.210 --> 11:52.372
you how you felt about all that. Well I didn't feel 
well about it at all because I wasn't given any

11:52.392 --> 11:54.895
choice. My choice would have been I had my dog, 
fishing Yeah, you were happy. A river that ran

11:59.316 --> 12:00.797
through the farm. It was just heaven for a kid. You 
know, I had my rifle. I had a .22 rifle. I had a little

12:06.082 --> 12:08.083
.410 shotgun, and here I was. And then all of a 
sudden they're going to send me to this strange

12:09.024 --> 12:11.306
place. I read Zane Gray novels all the way down here 
and expecting to see that. Everybody still does, I

12:16.150 --> 12:18.772
meant. Just another big city. So I was very unhappy 
and wanted to go home. And I guess in my little mind

12:24.237 --> 12:27.580
figured, If I misbehaved and didn't stay, she'd 
send me back. And she outfoxed me. She put me in

12:34.264 --> 12:36.808
Central Catholic High School. Then the brothers 
and priests. Were those sisters? Okay, were they

12:38.390 --> 12:39.632
sisters or brothers? Brothers and priests. All 
brothers and priests. So when they took over, you

12:41.955 --> 12:44.718
did your homework. Yes, sir, I bet you did. If you 
started messing up, the principal went in and he

12:46.501 --> 12:54.791
had my favorite, most not favorite weapon, the 
razor strap, was on the wall. Yes. so kept you in

12:55.657 --> 13:25.275
line well but the best thing is that i met these 
wonderful young boys who befriended me and took me

12:55.657 --> 13:25.275
right into there and made me feel like one of them 
even though i wasn't a catholic so but i mean i still

12:55.657 --> 13:25.275
have the afraid i make every high school reunion we 
have one about every three four months there's

12:55.657 --> 13:25.275
only about 25 of us left living out of 82 that 
finished in 1938 yeah so uh yeah i I made these

13:25.829 --> 13:32.977
wonderful friends that I still communicate with, 
talk to, in fact, once a week. So things got better

13:33.037 --> 13:34.979
for you? Oh, yeah, right away. The ROTC gave me 
equality. We all had the same uniform, and I

13:39.123 --> 13:47.513
learned if I'd press my uniform, it could pass 
inspect, shoe shine, brass shine, belt buckle

13:39.123 --> 13:47.513
shine. But I could win inspections, and I made 
corporal in my first year. Then first sergeant my

13:53.082 --> 13:54.925
next year and so on. So ROTC was a big factor. In 
fact, the military has been a big factor all my

13:56.788 --> 13:59.973
life. That's probably one of the few schools with a 
high school ROTC. Oh, no. All of them had them.

14:05.722 --> 14:07.085
Public high schools had them, too. Is that right? 
Jefferson High School and Breckenridge and Texas

14:07.886 --> 14:11.572
Military and Peacock Military. I don't remember 
any in Louisiana. Well, LSU's probably still the

14:13.957 --> 14:19.523
only school left that has compulsory first two 
years ROTC. That's right. Yeah, I knew that. But

14:20.824 --> 14:22.767
there's no Corps of Cadets there. I don't think 
there has been in many years. But they may still

14:25.089 --> 14:27.412
have required that. But except the Pentagon's not 
too interested in teaching citizenship. That's

14:31.556 --> 14:32.757
what that is, really. It's a good thing to know, 
because you learn first aid, discipline, and all

14:33.698 --> 14:38.864
that. But anyway, so from high school ROTC, There 
was a couple of fellas had brothers at A&M, older

14:43.842 --> 14:51.054
brothers. And I saw a man named Charlie Stout, 
S-T-O-U-D-T, Stout. This guy was my same age. He

15:00.068 --> 15:01.050
was my neighbor. He didn't go to Central. He went to 
Jefferson. But his brother came home with his A&M,

15:04.515 --> 15:10.525
had the boots on and the britches and this dark 
olive green shirt. And the campaign hat, I

15:10.690 --> 15:16.516
thought, if I could ever look like that, wouldn't 
that be something? So I was kind of led to A&M by the

15:16.536 --> 15:19.820
uniform and the ROTC. I knew pretty well, because I 
already knew how to march and do all the commands.

15:26.146 --> 15:28.849
In those days, it was very difficult. When you 
drilled, you didn't have just a right face forward

15:29.290 --> 15:33.194
march. It would be right face. You have to give the 
command for your rifles.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.422
But in those days, we used squads. It was right by 
squads and a column of squads, right platoon,

15:44.522 --> 15:49.029
right by. Very difficult. You had to really read 
the manual and practice a lot to be the pizit man. I

15:54.737 --> 15:56.059
can imagine. Yeah. So anyway, the ROTC is what led 
me to A&M in 1938. And I was very confused, and I was

16:00.966 --> 16:05.993
having so much fun. of being a sorry freshman, not 
doing what I was supposed to do, and not getting

16:06.547 --> 16:15.079
caught much at it, because I found out when they 
were hazing, that's when I was janitor. You see, I

16:15.840 --> 16:25.733
was janitor at the Petroleum Engineering 
Building, and I missed all of the little programs

16:15.840 --> 16:25.733
where you might be. So I was always at seeing 
cadets, or I was always going someplace and stayed

16:25.813 --> 16:33.904
away from the dorm during those hectic hours. But 
they didn't bother me a whole lot. I just had a lot of

16:36.902 --> 16:38.124
fun. When I found out right off, I didn't think I 
ought to be an engineer. And about my sophomore

16:42.849 --> 16:48.275
year, I knew I wasn't going to be an engineer. So I 
went and talked to the dean. He said, I told him I

16:50.017 --> 16:53.140
wanted to change to liberal arts. And he said, 
well, you're going to lose practically half of

16:53.941 --> 16:56.824
what you've taken. But if you switch to industrial 
education, you won't lose anything. So go talk to

17:00.328 --> 17:02.811
E.L. Williams and see if he'll take you. So at the 
end of my sophomore year, I changed courses. Who

17:08.530 --> 17:09.191
was the dean? Do you remember? Dean Gilchrist. 
Gilchrist was the dean. And Dean Bolton was dean of

17:13.618 --> 17:15.983
the college. G.O. Walton was president. And 
George Moore was commandant, class of, what,

17:19.408 --> 17:26.461
class of 06 or something? Eight, class of eight, I 
think. So in those days, of course, it was all

17:30.331 --> 17:33.695
military. We did have some postgraduate students 
that were working on master's degrees in

17:33.755 --> 17:39.881
engineering or agriculture. And I guess they gave 
a doctorate in those days. I'm not sure. And we had

17:45.587 --> 17:51.694
veterinary medicine students that lived in what 
they called postgraduate hall. Called it PG Hall

17:51.714 --> 17:54.457
over behind Walton. It was a wooden building. 
Pretty nice building.

18:01.465 --> 18:04.968
But I made such good friends here, just like high 
school.

18:07.770 --> 18:16.037
But really, if I could do it over again, I would have 
majored in liberal arts, because I really enjoyed

18:07.770 --> 18:16.037
it more than I did. I enjoyed history more and more. 
I'll just say that I was more motivated on those

18:18.279 --> 18:23.203
subjects than I was. You might have ended up a 
college professor or something. You're probably

18:27.467 --> 18:29.689
better off where you went. My roommate did, Dave 
Finch. Anyway, my impression then of A&M was it was

18:31.402 --> 18:43.916
a place of high concern for knowledge. I mean, 
everybody was concerned about their grades and

18:43.976 --> 18:55.629
studying and a lot of emphasis by the 
upperclassmen to see that the freshmen were in

18:43.976 --> 18:55.629
their rooms at night and at least had a book open in 
front of them. You can't make them read, but you can

18:55.649 --> 18:59.974
certainly make sure they got a book. make sure that 
they go to class because their schedules are

19:00.308 --> 19:03.771
posted on the door. Now, they're each room, each 
student's schedule. Do you think that that kind of

19:07.074 --> 19:12.219
concern slacked off for some time after the war or 
was persisting? Because, you know, that was one of

19:12.239 --> 19:16.923
the criticisms leveled at the core, that they 
didn't stress education. There was too much

19:16.943 --> 19:22.028
distraction in the 60s and 70s, I know, when I was 
there. I don't know. That's part of just the

19:22.629 --> 19:25.311
general... I can't really address myself to that 
specifically because... I never had the feeling

19:31.443 --> 19:39.852
that, I thought that there always was a certain 
percentage of students that were real, highly

19:31.443 --> 19:39.852
motivated. Well I think so too. And my guess is that 
at that time people came to school realizing this

19:42.615 --> 19:48.142
was their big opportunity. I'll say this though, 
there was an element in most outfits that took the

19:48.262 --> 19:55.830
hazing and the shouting matches and things like 
that, what they called good bull, took that pretty

19:56.215 --> 20:01.402
seriously. And that a shy freshman, very timid or 
backward, would have a difficulty in responding

20:02.003 --> 20:10.614
to that. He took it too seriously. And I think I 
always took it as fun. I thought it was a play or

20:15.921 --> 20:22.510
acting and things like that because of the stern 
faces scolding and freshman year so so i thought

20:23.097 --> 20:47.603
that was good so that when you got to be a sophomore 
you had to learn to make make the ugly face and

20:23.097 --> 20:47.603
demand attention and all that stuff but some of the 
sophomores went overboard sure and this caused a

20:23.097 --> 20:47.603
lot of distraction and it did cause a lot of people 
to leave school in those days they couldn't leave

20:23.097 --> 20:47.603
the corps they had to leave school period yeah so i 
think it was a I just think it was overdone for

20:47.971 --> 20:50.454
several years. But it's hard to be specific about 
this. In generalities, I thought there was

20:52.437 --> 21:00.709
a great deal of consternation in the 
administration. If you look at the history,

21:00.769 --> 21:05.836
you'll see that the Corps was compulsory, and then 
it was non-compulsory. They tried that for a

21:05.876 --> 21:07.498
while. The big thing you notice is that they had a 
commandant, such as they have today, a man named

21:14.853 --> 21:17.916
Well, when I was in school, it was all military. 
Active duty, like General Moore. Colonel Moore

21:20.578 --> 21:22.219
was active duty. But after the war, a man named Joe 
Davis was class of 29, became commandant. And he

21:27.704 --> 21:36.232
was a state employee paid by the university, and 
his staff were all non-active duty, except for the

21:27.704 --> 21:36.232
ROTC instructors. They were active duty. So you 
had a mixture, like we do today. You have the

21:40.536 --> 21:44.539
instructors in the classroom, The staff, the... 
Vannevar mentioned that as a very important

21:44.705 --> 21:57.461
element in the core relationship, was that it be a 
university employee who's in authority. Like we

21:57.521 --> 22:02.707
have now, General Darling, even though he's 
retired, he's not on active duty. And remember

22:03.428 --> 22:12.038
when Colonel Parsons was here, the former 
students and others were telling him what had to

22:03.428 --> 22:12.038
happen in the Corps and having programs help the 
Corps. He says, wait a minute. He said, my boss is a

22:14.152 --> 22:18.577
commanding general, 4th Army. I work for him. Now, 
he says, my secondary boss is the dean of students

22:21.501 --> 22:26.927
and the president of the university. He said, I 
report to them. But he said, they're not

22:29.009 --> 22:34.015
immediately who signs my paycheck. That makes a 
difference. Yes. And he said, I have a staff here.

22:39.101 --> 22:40.783
We'll take care of things in the Corps. but he said i 
don't need any outside pressures and influence

22:41.033 --> 23:08.408
tell me how to run the court he says i can be relieved 
and replaced but as long as i'm in command as long as

22:41.033 --> 23:08.408
i'm here in charge why don't listen and uh i kind of 
feel that way today i'm not concerned about the

22:41.033 --> 23:08.408
core that's general darling and his staff he has 
staff of very capable people and he's certainly a

22:41.033 --> 23:08.408
highly qualified man and he's going to do the right 
he's going to do the very best he can because in this

23:08.759 --> 23:11.703
changing world of youth, youth world. It's all 
different. But so the fact we have a corps is

23:13.725 --> 23:16.549
commendable. And I'll say one thing, the quality 
is sheer high. It's not as big as we'd like for it to

23:20.694 --> 23:25.961
be, but the people I know in the corps are certainly 
outstanding. I want to come back to that. 1938,

23:27.202 --> 23:34.031
and you're going to be in school through 1941. 42. 
42.

23:37.582 --> 23:42.050
I wasn't able to have a contract. I wasn't 
classified my junior year. So I got a contract my

23:43.954 --> 23:45.777
senior year. And I graduated in January of 43 with a 
class of 43. That's why I go to both reunions. And I

23:51.888 --> 23:54.654
have equal friends in both classes. Of course, 
actually, the truth is I go to 41, 42, 43, and 44. All

23:58.981 --> 24:00.845
the above. Yeah. I've

24:02.438 --> 24:14.191
been to several student meetings, and they're 
always asking me questions about what was it like

24:02.438 --> 24:14.191
then, and what does the future look like? That's 
what I'm going to ask you. I'm glad you've been

24:16.854 --> 24:18.095
thinking about it. So you graduated in 43. Yes. 
Went right into active duty. See, we didn't have

24:25.623 --> 24:31.990
any summer camp, the six-week summer camp that was 
required for ROTC reserve commissions. So the

24:32.527 --> 24:43.997
Army didn't know what in the world to do, except 
they decided, because they had the OCS program

24:32.527 --> 24:43.997
going and the OCS curriculum was the same as the 
company officer's course. The difference was the

24:44.017 --> 24:49.702
OCS required a little more discipline and a little 
more harassment and so on. But the basic studies in

24:50.944 --> 25:01.453
communications and motor transport and 
organization and gunnery was exactly the same as

24:50.944 --> 25:01.453
the battery officer's course. They did two 
things. They made corporals so we could be

25:02.611 --> 25:07.297
admitted to OCS. We were inducted as privates in 
our closest place. Houston was Ellington Field,

25:10.822 --> 25:15.027
and San Antonio was Fort Sam Houston, and so on. 
Every major city had an induction station. We were

25:18.371 --> 25:27.623
all inducted in the service and issued a uniform 
and made corporals and sent to basic schools. I

25:27.723 --> 25:30.647
went to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to the artillery 
school. Others went to Fort Benning, others went

25:30.847 --> 25:40.765
to Fort Monmouth, Signal Corps, Coastal 
Artillery went down to Galveston, Fort Crockett,

25:30.847 --> 25:40.765
and so on. We reported there to OCS. All the basic 
arms, like Fort Knox was the armored school, and

25:42.709 --> 25:48.620
Fort Riley was the cavalry. By the way, a lot of them 
went into tank destroyer school at Fort Hood.

25:54.337 --> 25:59.564
which used anti-tank guns with the infantry, and 
they were organized in battalions and companies.

25:59.585 --> 26:03.230
So when did you get your orders to OCS, before 
graduation and everything? Was this all pretty

26:03.550 --> 26:04.632
well? Well, it was all laid out, but we didn't 
actually get them until we graduated with our, in

26:04.752 --> 26:10.740
Guyon Hall. We were given a couple of tickets for 
our family, because Guyon Hall didn't hold very

26:11.141 --> 26:19.513
many people, because the graduates took up about 
600, I guess, in our class that graduated. And

26:20.054 --> 26:20.935
everybody that finished at that time, even though 
they hadn't graduated, went on active duty. But

26:26.802 --> 26:28.645
then they came back after one graduated. And we had 
to go to our nearest station, and there we were

26:29.206 --> 26:33.614
inducted. Then from there, we went by train to our 
various posts. And so the answer is no. We had to

26:41.609 --> 26:43.412
report to the induction station. for induction 
into the Army. From there, we got our orders. We got

26:47.270 --> 26:54.301
orders for promotion to corporal and for report to 
Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for testing, physicals.

26:54.481 --> 26:55.964
We'd already taken one physical up there. They 
gave us an officer's physical. It was a little

26:57.486 --> 27:02.674
different, a little more extensive. And we took 
mathematics quizzes and exams for trigonometry

27:02.694 --> 27:11.307
and algebra and geometry. mainly because 
artillery has a lot of that in it. And you were in OCS

27:16.056 --> 27:19.359
for, is it six weeks? Yeah, we went in in January, 
and we, no, no, three and a half months. Three and a

27:25.145 --> 27:26.146
half months, okay. See, January 23rd to May the 
6th. Yeah, nearly four months, yeah. And at the end

27:36.115 --> 27:37.216
you got your orders. We got our orders, and they 
were commissioned second lieutenants, and the

27:40.430 --> 27:42.613
United States Army Reserve. And we were given 
assignments. Most of them were to the replacement

27:45.898 --> 27:50.805
training center and officer pools, further 
education. And most of us went to training

27:51.947 --> 27:54.791
centers. In my case, it was the Field Artillery 
Replacement Training Center in Fort Sill, where

27:54.811 --> 28:07.049
we trained everything from cooks to bakers and 
linemen and gun crews and things like that. And

28:07.069 --> 28:10.234
then from there, the men were shipped out as 
replacements. outfits activated, repenting

28:10.535 --> 28:14.499
activation in the United States, and some of them 
went to Europe. I was going to ask you, did most of

28:15.019 --> 28:19.564
those out of Fort Sill go to Europe or the Pacific, 
or both, I guess? Yeah, about half. It was just a

28:22.126 --> 28:27.911
requisition filled either way by personnel, but 
Europe took the most. Of course, as it had gotten up

28:28.032 --> 28:36.019
time for the invasion, Europe was...

28:36.960 --> 28:38.061
I got my orders...

28:40.724 --> 28:46.871
Let's see, in May of 44, May, was that right? Yeah, 
well, April, really, April 44, I got my orders to

28:46.891 --> 28:55.441
report to Fort Hamilton, New York as a 
replacement. And the next morning, I was supposed

28:55.461 --> 29:10.478
to get on the train on Saturday morning, and they 
knocked on my door at 5 o'clock and gave me orders

28:55.461 --> 29:10.478
changing, I guess, all of us, about 50 of us, were 
being transferred to Camp Breckenridge,

29:11.892 --> 29:19.841
Kentucky, to a field artillery group pending 
activation. And we didn't know it then, but these

29:21.102 --> 29:26.488
battalions about, let's see, there were eight 
battalions there. There was eight battalions at

29:26.508 --> 29:28.070
Camp Chaffee. Sixteen battalions were 
activated, organized from enlisted men that were

29:28.110 --> 29:36.079
in the West Coast Harbor Defense, that is, the 
Coast Artillery men. And these men were inducted I

29:40.580 --> 29:42.603
mean, transferred to field artillery. These 
battalions were to reinforce the fires of the

29:43.364 --> 29:48.070
Rhine River crossing. They were 155 howitzer and 
8-inch howitzer. That's medium and heavy

29:52.196 --> 29:55.300
artillery to reinforce the fires. There wasn't 
enough corps artillery to concentrate as much as

29:55.320 --> 30:02.509
they needed for such an undertaking as crossing 
the Rhine River. They didn't know where that was

30:02.670 --> 30:04.512
going to be. And they had several sites. It 
depended on the whole situation as to which site

30:06.763 --> 30:10.987
they could use. And we were, but as it turned out, we 
were too late by the time we got to the Red River.

30:16.812 --> 30:19.375
They had long since, because they got the Remagen 
Bridge. So that, we were just, we were a month too

30:20.075 --> 30:24.019
late. We cruised past that a couple years ago and 
took that Rhine cruise, and that thing's still

30:24.159 --> 30:28.744
hanging out there. It's interesting. Isn't that 
really? You can't tell how many lives that saved.

30:34.049 --> 30:34.549
Imagine that. would have been crossing that 
river. But see, this gave them time to get in the two

30:38.340 --> 30:41.202
pontoon bridges. They got those in right away. 
Boy, they couldn't have done it with the enemy fire

30:44.926 --> 30:51.273
on them and artillery and everything else they had 
on them. Okay, so you did go to Kentucky, though,

30:51.293 --> 30:53.735
Camp Breckenridge. Oh, yeah. And then what 
happened? We came back to Fort Sill. And you came

30:58.440 --> 30:59.501
back to Fort Sill. As school troops. And then we had 
to come to Fort Hood to take our battery test. And so

31:03.844 --> 31:06.628
we didn't get overseas, you see, until the fall of 
1944. And that's why we were too late for the Rhine

31:08.311 --> 31:10.995
River crossing. And then we came back in 1945. 
Where did they bring you in? In France, Holland?

31:19.227 --> 31:21.371
Yes, we went into La Harpe. Yeah, that's where 
almost everybody was. The equipment ships, in

31:24.215 --> 31:27.520
fact, our ship was— delayed, and we had to go from 
Southampton. They sent us across to Dieppe. And we

31:34.045 --> 31:45.482
stayed in the abattoir, the slaughterhouse, was 
our controlment area, which was about, I imagine,

31:34.045 --> 31:45.482
about 50 kilometers or so from Laharm. And then I 
took a skeleton gun crew and went down with our

31:46.263 --> 31:56.899
equipment ship, came in there to unload them and 
get the cosmoline off and get them prepared to go up

31:57.267 --> 31:59.449
to move into Germany. So they sent you from there to 
the front? Yeah. And what army? Well, we were in the

32:04.415 --> 32:11.943
20th Corps, and that corps was moved from one army 
to another. We ended up in the 3rd Army, and the 22nd

32:11.963 --> 32:17.289
Corps was also there. We were in that for a little 
while. They would shift these battalions and

32:18.530 --> 32:25.097
these groups of artillery depending on the need 
for it. See, in the Battle of the Balls, they didn't

32:25.516 --> 32:32.183
need, they needed ammunition more than they 
needed anymore. And so in order to get the

32:32.664 --> 32:41.353
ammunition, well, they just switched all these 
battalions to the north and were coming up, I

32:32.664 --> 32:41.353
guess, sort of behind the Third Army, the 20th 
Corps. You know, when you're at that level, you

32:42.374 --> 32:45.077
don't really know a lot of this. No, you don't ask. 
It wasn't until I read the history of World War II to

32:46.959 --> 32:49.482
find out. Yeah, what you had done. Okay, so you were 
in Germany then until... until August of 1945.

32:59.501 --> 33:00.602
Where were you when the war ended? We were right 
there at Burncastle on the Moselle. Beautiful,

33:04.087 --> 33:05.088
beautiful. We were supposed to be security 
guards, and our main problem was keeping our

33:05.609 --> 33:17.445
enlisted men away from the military government 
people, because the military government was

33:05.609 --> 33:17.445
supposed to enforce the fraternization order. 
And we weren't supposed to fraternize with the

33:18.746 --> 33:23.012
German citizens. Well, those beautiful German 
girls and our men hadn't been around ladies, so

33:23.903 --> 33:30.330
this caused a problem. Because I was a captain, and 
so the military government was a captain, and he

33:32.373 --> 33:42.765
was fussing about my men walking down the street 
with these German girls, so I had to get that

33:32.373 --> 33:42.765
correct. Then he wanted us to court-martial one of 
them, and I had more to do. We were looking mainly

33:49.753 --> 33:51.835
for S.S. people that had escaped. They had a big 
concentration. We went up on Bad Neuheim. There

33:59.326 --> 34:01.108
was a big POW camp there. And they just screened 
them temporarily. They were looking for SS. And

34:05.852 --> 34:07.874
they screened all these men. It was right in the 
summer of 45 there. It was real warm. And some

34:12.218 --> 34:14.760
interesting things happened. They had a whole 
compound of German women who had been in the

34:14.780 --> 34:20.445
anti-aircraft artillery. They were gun crews for 
88 millimeters. and other anti-aircraft

34:22.865 --> 34:25.870
weapons. And they'd take sun baths, and these 
German men would get over in their compound and

34:25.890 --> 34:34.065
startle them, you know. And the ladies sometimes 
had their bras unhooked, and this caused

34:35.127 --> 34:45.666
hilarious—it was sexual harassment is what it 
was. And how long did they keep you in Germany now

34:45.933 --> 34:48.557
after the war? Well, we came back to go to Japan. Oh, 
okay. They pulled you right out. Yeah. We should

34:54.827 --> 34:56.149
have stayed, but we didn't. We were actually on the 
high seas. We came back to Le Havre again, and we

34:58.393 --> 35:04.242
were on our way to someplace in the Pacific. And so 
they turned us in. We came into Charleston, South

35:06.626 --> 35:12.075
Carolina instead of going through New York or— We 
didn't get to the Panama Canal. See, we were on the

35:13.957 --> 35:15.819
high seas someplace. And they diverted us into 
Charleston. We ended up in Camp Beale,

35:19.263 --> 35:21.025
California. You took the train? Uh-huh, took the 
train from Charleston to Camp Beale. And then in

35:27.553 --> 35:30.917
Camp Beale, what month is that? Do you remember? 
Oh, yeah, just about the time they dropped the

35:31.517 --> 35:33.620
A-bomb. Okay, August. August, yeah. Forty-five. 
Uh-huh. So you were on the way, though. I was on the

35:39.266 --> 35:40.628
way, yeah, yeah. Oh, they just had hundreds of 
ships, maybe more than hundreds. And your war

35:44.833 --> 35:46.435
ended in California? In California, yeah. And 
then they transferred everybody, I guess, in

35:48.358 --> 36:00.516
September, October, maybe in the fall there, 
September, October, because I remember coming to

35:48.358 --> 36:00.516
a football game down here at College Station from 
Fort Hood. They transferred us to Fort Hood,

36:00.896 --> 36:06.885
Texas, and we joined the 2nd Armored Division. at 
Fort Hood. And in other words, we were integrated,

36:09.897 --> 36:17.589
you might say, into the Second Army Division. And 
then later, we stayed in and reorganized,

36:17.609 --> 36:21.776
restructured. I didn't get out of the Army until a 
year later. When was my next question? 1946. Oh,

36:25.422 --> 36:29.488
OK. And had you any option? Yes, I could have stayed 
in if I would have taken the exams for integration

36:30.210 --> 36:34.797
into regular service. And I really wanted to in a 
way, but my wife's family was overseas, her mother

36:35.080 --> 36:40.548
and father. He was in the engineer corps. And my 
situation was very difficult. She had a baby while

36:50.782 --> 36:52.945
I was gone. And as soon as I got home, there was 
another one. And so I would have had to go to Korea.

37:00.215 --> 37:03.940
And so I couldn't have taken any family with me. So I 
decided I'd abandon her enough, and so I got out of

37:04.190 --> 37:09.937
the Army then. But I went right into the Reserve. 
That was in August, you said, of 46. No, let's see,

37:13.741 --> 37:19.007
October, September, the fall of 46.

37:22.691 --> 37:24.313
And so you're coming back to San Antonio? Came back 
to San Antonio, uh-huh. And I took over my mother's

37:26.796 --> 37:30.180
weaving business, and I got that. going again and 
got some girls trained. I had a girl in Omaha,

37:33.307 --> 37:36.392
Nebraska that came down. She was the best one we 
ever had. We had her during the war. Her husband was

37:39.436 --> 37:42.600
in the Army there at Fort Sam. So once she got two or 
three good girls trained, plus myself and my wife,

37:42.620 --> 37:50.351
we all learned this reweaving technique. Hose 
mending was pretty well out of the business by then

37:50.371 --> 37:54.957
because nylons had come on the scene. And nylons 
were inexpensive. They were cheap, you might say.

37:59.489 --> 38:01.872
And silk hosiery was just too expensive. And so the 
hose mending went up, but the reweaving business

38:02.513 --> 38:07.599
was pretty good. But like any other small 
business, it didn't work too well for me because

38:08.881 --> 38:16.250
labor costs, you had to pay at least 50% labor. Then 
by the time you got workman's comp, and if you had

38:16.891 --> 38:23.539
three or more employees, you had to have 
unemployment comp, and you had to have a

38:16.891 --> 38:23.539
hospitalization. See, this is not new. We had to do 
all these things in those days. We had to take out

38:27.513 --> 38:29.896
withholding taxes, social security. And I had a 
high school classmate of mine who helped me with

38:30.676 --> 38:43.410
all that sort of regulations and bookkeeping that 
a business had to have, because I hadn't taken any

38:30.676 --> 38:43.410
business courses at A&M. So I had to get a CPA to help 
me set up my books and help me with the forms I needed

38:43.430 --> 38:49.577
for all of that. But I just didn't make much money 
out of it. So in 1948, I had a chance for a wonderful

38:52.687 --> 38:57.052
job with the state. This was organizing National 
Guard units, and this is where my knowledge of A&M

38:57.312 --> 39:02.157
men came in. So we organized units in the Rio Grande 
Valley and out in West Texas. And actually, I was

39:08.484 --> 39:14.790
doing that when the- What was your rank when you 
left service? Captain. Actually, when I went in

39:16.492 --> 39:19.075
the reserve, I got promoted to major. And

39:19.578 --> 39:27.166
let's see. Oh yeah, then I went to work for the, I 
went back in the Army again in 51.

39:36.435 --> 39:40.800
But you were with the state, with the National 
Guard until 51. Uh-huh, from 48 to 51. And I was on

39:43.302 --> 39:49.028
active duty through 54, 55, 55.

39:49.852 --> 40:01.985
Yeah,

39:49.852 --> 40:01.985
I got out in 55.

40:04.848 --> 40:05.829
And what rank are you now? Lieutenant Colonel. And 
where were you most of the time, 51 to 55? No, mostly

40:11.995 --> 40:14.678
I was in the I was in Fort Sill, and I was in Fort Knox 
mostly. I stayed at Fort Knox. I went to the armored

40:20.487 --> 40:21.468
school. I've got my certificate at Fort Knox. And 
then I stayed there for quite a while and went to

40:25.853 --> 40:31.759
Europe with a crew on temporary duty. And I came 
back and took some special courses in nuclear

40:32.340 --> 40:36.804
weapons. And then I went to Command General Staff 
School for a year. So that took up my time. I did not

40:41.750 --> 40:43.011
go to Korea. I had a terrible guilty conscience 
about that. No more.

40:51.896 --> 40:53.518
So you're going to get out in 55. Yeah. And I went to 
work for the City Public Service Board in San

40:53.818 --> 41:00.807
Antonio in the personnel department. What were 
you doing there? Well, actually, I was training. I

41:04.613 --> 41:10.180
had to take the cadet course and go through the 
whole company and write papers and dissertations

41:10.362 --> 41:12.985
on each department. What was the title again? Gas 
and Electric Utility of Bexar County. And

41:19.171 --> 41:27.741
that was real interesting to me. I really enjoyed, 
I was a real education in electrical engineering,

41:27.781 --> 41:39.373
mechanics, understanding power plants, 
electric distribution, and the underground

41:27.781 --> 41:39.373
systems of big cities and certain the elite 
neighborhoods that had underground electric

41:39.708 --> 41:47.479
transformers underground and distribution 
underground and everything. I was mystified by

41:48.160 --> 41:53.368
that, how the tunnels, they tunneled under the 
cities and put all that stuff together. You never

41:53.508 --> 41:55.491
think about it, do you? Also, I can look at a power 
line and know what wattage it's carrying and

41:55.511 --> 42:03.503
understand the different transformers. They 
reduce it down to the 220, the 110 that brings it in

42:03.924 --> 42:08.230
the house. you distributed about 4,000 KW. So it 
was real education for me. And the gas

42:14.605 --> 42:17.088
distribution, too. See, they had the gas company. 
And these were not really owned by the city,

42:19.149 --> 42:29.920
because the bonding company, the Harris Trust of 
Chicago, really owned those companies, because

42:19.149 --> 42:29.920
they didn't cost the city a penny. See, they were 
all bond, municipal bonds, or construction

42:29.940 --> 42:38.908
bonds. The money was borrowed, paid back by 
revenues. Then excess revenues were given to the

42:41.927 --> 42:52.320
city in lieu of taxes, as opposed to a private power 
company like Houston Lighting and Power and so on.

42:52.340 --> 43:00.390
San Antonio actually was, well, you could say 
city-owned because it was called City Public

42:52.340 --> 43:00.390
Service Board, gas and electric. The city owned 
the water, too, of course. Private investment. It

43:04.437 --> 43:18.716
was very efficient, and it was operated under the 
same structure that a private company was,

43:04.437 --> 43:18.716
modeled after the same employee situation and the 
same qualifications. So how long did you stay with

43:18.736 --> 43:20.919
the city? Well, I stayed with them until 1959,

43:20.939 --> 43:34.056
and I had a chance to go to an advertising company, a 
sharp company out of Austin. gave me the chance to

43:34.610 --> 43:39.938
sell advertising for school book covers and other 
institutional advertising. I had to travel

43:39.998 --> 43:41.661
throughout South Texas. It was called Sharp? 
SHARP, Sharpton Company. Are they still there? I

43:46.848 --> 43:47.609
don't think so. I don't think so. The people who 
owned it are not—in fact, that man was a lawyer.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.181
Bill Pittenger was a lawyer. But it was a pretty 
good deal. It made good money. Yeah, I traveled to

44:01.677 --> 44:05.822
San Antonio and all of South Texas. I called on 
institutional advertisers and school

44:06.543 --> 44:11.229
superintendents. And I sold really whatever they 
cut me. They didn't have different, like

44:14.874 --> 44:20.822
Coca-Cola or the big banks and so on like that. We 
sold some billboards. So they were kind of a

44:24.466 --> 44:27.030
multimedia company. But the big thing was the 
school book covers. They had a big printing shop

44:28.972 --> 44:31.195
there. And they printed and distributed these 
school book covers all over Texas. It was law that

44:35.236 --> 44:40.222
they had to, and that was really nice. That gave me 
more time to devote to A&M. Actually, I was

44:45.309 --> 44:49.976
president of the San Antonio A&M Club when I was 
with the public service. And then I got on the board

44:51.157 --> 44:55.984
of the former students when I was with this other 
company, It gave me a chance to be on the campus a lot

44:56.403 --> 45:02.531
more for board meetings and council meetings and 
committee meetings and so on. So I had a chance to

45:02.551 --> 45:07.016
see what A&M was doing in the late 50s. And the 
director of the Former Students Association? It

45:12.263 --> 45:13.244
was Dick Hervey. Dick Hervey. Uh-huh. See, 
McQuillan had been director from 28 to 47. And then

45:19.452 --> 45:26.140
Hervey came in at 47. And I joined him in 61.

45:37.806 --> 45:39.429
That was a pretty awesome experience. I'll tell 
you how this happened.
