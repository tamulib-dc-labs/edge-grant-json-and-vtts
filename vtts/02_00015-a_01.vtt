WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:04.263
Three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

00:04.483 --> 00:08.187
Testing, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

00:11.590 --> 00:25.405
This is August the 8th in the Small Animal Clinic of the College of Veterinary Medicine, and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Dr. Bonnie Beaver, professor of... Small Animal Medicine and Surgery.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.507
Small Animal Medicine and Surgery.

00:28.297 --> 00:40.787
Bonnie, to begin with, would you introduce yourself to this tape by describing family, where you grew up, went to high school, went to college, before you came to College Station?

00:41.678 --> 00:43.561
Well, I'm a Minnesota product.

00:44.963 --> 00:55.419
I was raised in a small farm just west of the Minneapolis area in Minnesota and grew up with one sister, a mother and father.

00:55.459 --> 01:03.552
My father passed away when I was a junior in high school and graduated from Mound, Minnesota High School.

01:04.747 --> 01:12.484
Went to the University of Minnesota, did my pre-veterinary work there, which was two years at that time.

01:13.125 --> 01:18.376
Then went into their College of Veterinary Medicine and received my DVM degree.

01:19.058 --> 01:25.371
Actually, I got my bachelor's degree in 66 and my DVM degree in 68.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.956
and then started looking for a job.

01:29.298 --> 01:33.185
The University of Minnesota had an opening.

01:33.266 --> 01:37.794
One of their surgeons had suddenly left and they asked me to come back for a year.

01:38.275 --> 01:46.650
So I'd spent a short time in practice with a local practitioner and then went back to the university in surgery.

01:46.630 --> 01:52.859
And then after that year was up, started looking for other things and decided university life wasn't all that bad.

01:53.280 --> 01:58.488
And where could I go and work on a faculty and work toward an advanced degree at the same time?

01:59.109 --> 02:02.514
And Texas A&M was just one of those places.

02:02.594 --> 02:05.979
And I thought, well, it was one of the few that I couldn't actually visit.

02:05.999 --> 02:07.742
So I said, I'll take a chance.

02:07.782 --> 02:08.843
I'll come down for a year.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.185
And if I don't like it, I'll leave.

02:10.245 --> 02:13.330
So 31 years later, I'm still waiting to leave.

02:13.597 --> 02:15.722
What did you know about A&M at that point?

02:15.742 --> 02:16.062
Nothing.

02:16.243 --> 02:17.305
Absolutely nothing.

02:17.365 --> 02:19.590
I didn't even know what the A&M stood for.

02:20.391 --> 02:23.538
I knew nothing about the traditions or any part of it.

02:23.618 --> 02:26.745
So it was just a university as far as I knew.

02:27.232 --> 02:33.963
Describe your first impression of the vet school and of the community when you arrived.

02:33.983 --> 02:41.695
Well, when I came down, I had a horse trailer on behind with a horse on one side and a television set and boxes and stuff on the other side.

02:42.476 --> 02:45.421
And I actually came down by hitting a couple of horse shows on the way down.

02:45.481 --> 02:50.809
So I got here toward the end of September in the fall of 1969.

02:51.937 --> 02:54.721
I met several of the faculty here.

02:54.801 --> 03:02.531
One of them actually had a boarding place that I could keep my horse for a while and spent the first couple of days looking around and trying to find an apartment.

03:03.051 --> 03:11.603
And I was impressed with the size of the school, but I had come from the University of Minnesota, which at that time was an extremely large campus, at least the Minneapolis campus was.

03:11.883 --> 03:12.103
St.

03:12.123 --> 03:12.944
Paul was small.

03:13.365 --> 03:20.374
And so Texas A&M reminded me of a reasonable size at that time to meet university.

03:20.354 --> 03:25.027
And the people at the veterinary school were just wonderful to be around.

03:25.108 --> 03:27.254
And so I thought, well, this will be interesting.

03:27.334 --> 03:30.904
But I'm young and naive, so it's a good time and a good place to be.

03:31.508 --> 03:33.652
And your title?

03:34.774 --> 03:50.281
I came as an instructor in the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and over the years climbed through the ranks and then moved from the Department of Anatomy into the Department of Small Animal Medicine and Surgery where I currently still reside.

03:50.822 --> 03:52.986
I won't ask any more of this question.

03:53.006 --> 03:54.529
What was the beginning salary?

03:55.640 --> 03:56.582
I don't remember.

03:56.822 --> 04:06.461
I want to say it was about $7,500, but it's been so long ago I'd really have to go and look at it again.

04:06.722 --> 04:09.788
And describe the terms of your appointment.

04:09.808 --> 04:12.012
Were you supposed to work on a degree?

04:12.245 --> 04:20.074
No, I didn't have to, but I found that I was allowed to take four hours a semester, so that was a fun thing to be able to do.

04:20.475 --> 04:27.363
And I knew that if I was at a school, it would be stupid not to work on an advanced degree, so I did.

04:27.884 --> 04:31.568
And Dean Gage was, in fact, one of the people on my committee.

04:33.210 --> 04:35.012
So it was kind of a fun situation.

04:35.026 --> 04:39.093
Describe the leadership of the College of Veterinary Medicine at that point.

04:39.554 --> 04:50.314
At that time, Al Price was the dean, and Wally Bay was the associate dean for academic affairs.

04:50.494 --> 04:53.760
Describe them and their talents and personality.

04:53.875 --> 05:01.612
Well, it was interesting because Al Price introduced me to the faculty at the first faculty meeting I went to as integrating the faculty.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.997
I was first woman in the college.

05:05.120 --> 05:11.614
That also meant there were a lot of people that didn't exactly know what to do with me.

05:12.218 --> 05:15.443
The department chair of anatomy was Raymond Siss.

05:15.503 --> 05:18.087
He was fairly new in that particular position.

05:18.508 --> 05:25.118
And John Milliff, the former department chair, was still on the faculty, and he was teaching the neuroanatomy courses at that time.

05:25.639 --> 05:29.044
So it was an interesting situation to work with someone.

05:29.084 --> 05:30.126
Dr. Milliff's

05:30.106 --> 05:48.727
brilliance in an area that I knew nothing about and was kind of interested in, and to work with Dr. Siss, who was very generous in allowing people to develop talents in areas that weren't exactly traditional anatomy, but if you had an interest, go for it.

05:49.508 --> 05:51.691
And you had no teaching experience?

05:51.711 --> 05:58.138
I had been on the University of Minnesota faculty for a year in the clinics, so I did have, came in with a year's teaching experience.

05:58.405 --> 06:17.933
describe what it was like to be the first woman there must have been some learning experiences you know the thing that I remember the most which isn't real good sometimes but I remember now looking back on it I was very ignorant and very naive in

06:18.858 --> 06:21.828
the way things could have been, should have been, and so on.

06:22.851 --> 06:30.336
There were a number of times where there would be comments that nowadays you'd get slapped with a sexual harassment suit, but in that

06:30.603 --> 06:33.646
day and age you really didn't even give a second thought to.

06:34.387 --> 06:56.070
I had grown up in a class, if you will, of 56 big brothers and so I was kind of used to having snide comments or made and they were just, they were usually made in fun and not out of detriment to the human and so I kind of didn't pay much attention to it and that probably was a good thing.

06:56.793 --> 07:09.880
At that point, as you look back, were there any things done or said that you now realize were intended negatively?

07:09.900 --> 07:12.245
Yes, there were.

07:12.506 --> 07:17.957
It wasn't as much what was said because in

07:18.190 --> 07:43.185
in a male body of people it probably was at that time common discussions but there were times in the way they were said that if you really thought about it had a very negative innuendo and and you were there were female students there were on average

07:43.469 --> 07:46.894
three to five female students now in the classes.

07:47.895 --> 08:04.357
Mary Heron was there as a graduate student, so there was one other semi-faculty type of person, and she was not allowed on the staff at the time because of her husband was on the staff, and therefore that was not allowed.

08:04.397 --> 08:08.262
You couldn't have two from the same faculty, or from the same family.

08:08.714 --> 08:15.990
And as you participated in faculty meetings, departmental meetings and everything from the very first?

08:16.038 --> 08:29.351
Yeah, I stayed very active and I had learned at Minnesota that in order to really understand what was going on, it was best to be active in the faculty issues and meetings and to participate.

08:30.211 --> 08:36.858
And so I did and learned a lot and became very good friends with the faculty members.

08:36.878 --> 08:39.480
So that was the right thing to do for several reasons.

08:40.181 --> 08:44.425
And in those early years, to whom did you turn for advice and counsel?

08:46.463 --> 08:52.710
In the early years, I don't know who.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.414
I really don't know.

08:55.474 --> 09:00.420
There were several people that were about my age.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.865
And probably within a group, we would discuss things.

09:04.945 --> 09:11.813
But I don't remember a single person that stood out as a mentor, so to speak.

09:12.383 --> 09:19.372
Now, describe Dr. Price and Dr. Bay and the way they went about leading the college in those years.

09:21.195 --> 09:27.423
Dr. Price, I remember as a consummate professional.

09:28.264 --> 09:31.829
He was always dressed appropriately.

09:31.849 --> 09:34.813
He spoke very eloquently.

09:35.907 --> 09:42.317
Dr. Bay also had a very high professional image and was well respected.

09:42.437 --> 09:48.927
And that, as a young professional person, I think was very, very important.

09:49.488 --> 09:58.461
It wasn't that I was around them a lot, but it was always the respect of the position that they held that I think is very important.

09:58.762 --> 10:02.387
And it's certainly something that has changed a lot over the years.

10:02.620 --> 10:08.010
What did a young female faculty member wear in those days?

10:08.030 --> 10:15.503
Well, I had always kind of been indoctrinated that, you know, basically you wore heels and a dress, but I went through school.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.526
Girls wore dresses to school.

10:18.007 --> 10:26.282
Pantsuits didn't even come in until, oh, probably ten years, five to ten years into my professional time here.

10:26.701 --> 10:31.789
And I was late in wearing that because that was not the thing to do.

10:31.809 --> 10:36.396
I recognized that there was a role model image that I did have to perform.

10:36.977 --> 10:45.170
Certainly in the laboratory, I'd wear a lab coat and I didn't usually wear heels because that was a solid concrete floor.

10:45.210 --> 10:49.317
So tennis shoes were okay, just to keep your feet comfortable.

10:50.039 --> 10:59.851
And then when you were on professional duty with a lab coat and so forth, you all wore the same lab coats, didn't you?

10:59.871 --> 11:02.714
Well, the students wore a different color lab coat.

11:03.395 --> 11:04.696
But I mean the professionals.

11:04.777 --> 11:06.399
The professionals.

11:06.459 --> 11:08.141
White was kind of the thing to wear.

11:08.881 --> 11:13.046
So everyone pretty much had white lab coats.

11:13.066 --> 11:16.030
They may have been jackets or longer coats.

11:16.246 --> 11:20.373
And were there social events that faculty members attended?

11:20.834 --> 11:24.420
Generally, there weren't many things for social events.

11:25.202 --> 11:26.644
You kind of made your own thing.

11:26.804 --> 11:33.055
And I was busy riding and showing horses literally all over the country, so it didn't make much difference.

11:33.135 --> 11:34.518
I had plenty of things to do.

11:35.059 --> 11:39.807
And where did you find a place to live and what was housing like here compared to Minnesota?

11:39.787 --> 11:42.950
Well, I found my first concern was the horse.

11:43.030 --> 11:46.294
And once the horse was taken care of, then I started looking at apartments.

11:46.354 --> 11:53.101
And I was really lucky because at that time, there were several new apartment complexes that had just gone in.

11:53.421 --> 11:59.628
And I chose Travis House Apartments on Highway 30, which is now Harvey Road.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.792
It was brand new, moved into a brand new apartment.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.956
And it really didn't interact much with the people that were there.

12:08.297 --> 12:09.658
Remember what the rent was?

12:09.959 --> 12:12.422
That would be an interesting comparison with the present.

12:14.144 --> 12:16.807
I want to say it was about $150 a month.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.671
And did prices here compared to Minneapolis seem?

12:21.512 --> 12:22.633
Prices were about the same.

12:22.693 --> 12:34.026
They were actually a little bit cheaper, but I didn't have the winter kinds of things, so I didn't need the heavy woolens, the winter coats, the winter tires, and so on.

12:34.681 --> 12:42.796
Now, surely you had some learning experiences about becoming a Texan, somebody trying to explain something that you're not understanding?

12:42.836 --> 12:51.593
The first experience, there were two experiences that I remember, and they were not, well, there are actually three, one here and two elsewhere.

12:52.231 --> 12:57.718
The first year, showing horses was a very, very important part of my life at that time.

12:58.138 --> 13:00.081
And I went up to the State Fair at Dallas.

13:00.781 --> 13:06.849
And the first typical Texan that I saw, the long, tall Texan, was from Indiana.

13:07.610 --> 13:14.658
Then I went on another horse show, and I stayed with a family in northeast Texas, near Terrell.

13:15.679 --> 13:19.504
And I remember getting so tired listening.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.687
because they talked funny.

13:22.628 --> 13:27.715
And it wasn't the southern drawl, and you really had to listen very hard.

13:28.096 --> 13:38.910
My mother subsequently confirmed that that was true, because when she would get tired of listening to my husband, she'd just tell him to be quiet so she could stop listening.

13:38.890 --> 13:46.062
The third experience that I think of was one that really had to do with Texas A&M and many of the traditions here.

13:46.623 --> 13:57.402
I knew that ROTC, as we would call it in Minnesota, was a big deal, but I didn't realize the extent of the importance here.

13:58.143 --> 14:03.953
So when I came down during the first week I had to make several trips over on campus to

14:04.135 --> 14:07.203
sign up for different things and get registered for different things.

14:07.664 --> 14:11.253
And I met several of the guys in the core walking across campus.

14:11.273 --> 14:15.404
Well, I didn't know anything about senior spurs and senior boots.

14:15.484 --> 14:18.772
And I thought, well, that looks pretty stupid walking around with jodhpurs.

14:18.812 --> 14:21.098
I wonder if they've ever even been on a horse.

14:21.078 --> 14:25.386
And then they'd keep saying, howdy ma'am, howdy ma'am, howdy ma'am.

14:25.406 --> 14:34.564
And I started looking to make sure my slip wasn't showing and that my zippers were zipped and so on, because it was a totally foreign experience to me.

14:34.696 --> 14:41.530
Did anyone ever attempt to straighten you out about anything or explain to you?

14:41.550 --> 14:45.118
No, I never had that happen to me.

14:45.198 --> 14:54.898
I certainly was involved in lots of discussions where different traditions were described, usually somebody reminiscing about.

14:54.878 --> 15:23.755
And just sitting, I can remember sitting back so many times and listening to the pranks that were pulled in the dorm, core dorms, and that type of thing that, you know, you had to grow to love the place just based on the types of pranks that went on because it was very easy to see how important that experience could become and to understand how the experience at A&M could be

15:25.355 --> 15:32.644
have a deeper meaning to Aggies than an experience at another college campus would have to those alums.

15:35.988 --> 15:43.237
Describe the department and its facilities, its resources.

15:43.437 --> 15:46.080
What was the department when you got here?

15:46.499 --> 15:51.226
The Department of Anatomy is not much different now than it was at that time.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.990
There was a very large gross anatomy lab.

15:54.030 --> 16:00.720
There was a small lab at the beginning, or front edge of it, and then you walk through that into a larger lab.

16:00.861 --> 16:03.124
We still use the same facilities today.

16:04.049 --> 16:07.257
The first floor was primarily gross anatomists.

16:07.277 --> 16:09.522
Offices were primarily second floor.

16:10.004 --> 16:16.560
And then the histology course was taught over in room 230, which has been remodeled.

16:17.161 --> 16:21.231
It's the same basic core space.

16:21.295 --> 16:35.123
The biomedical program grew during the time that I was involved with that department, and so we would watch teaching laboratories become more and more crowded as more and more students occupied the same amount of room.

16:36.847 --> 16:39.372
And who were the key people in the department then?

16:39.942 --> 16:43.708
The key people, well, my area was in gross anatomy.

16:44.689 --> 16:54.505
So Arden Kimler was here at the time and probably was, he was the elder senior state's person as far as gross anatomy was concerned.

16:56.308 --> 17:02.878
Racist taught some gross, Gerald Bratton, George Stott,

17:03.955 --> 17:06.279
Mike Shively came shortly thereafter.

17:06.319 --> 17:09.224
Ed Smallwood was here teaching gross at the time.

17:10.326 --> 17:12.590
Ed and I actually started at about the same time.

17:12.750 --> 17:18.420
So we kind of became classmates, if you will, in the educational experience.

17:18.485 --> 17:20.327
And what were your duties?

17:21.168 --> 17:22.390
Describe your assignment.

17:22.610 --> 17:28.777
My assignment, when I first came, I worked with large animal gross anatomy because that was the easiest one.

17:28.797 --> 17:37.387
In fact, I actually started with a graduate class so that I could learn the gross to teach the next semester to the veterinary students.

17:38.208 --> 17:47.479
My real interest was in the applied anatomy course because I've always been very clinically oriented, and that

17:47.459 --> 17:55.661
took anatomy from the dull cadaver into the exam room, which is where the students wanted to go.

17:56.142 --> 18:03.021
I came during the trimester time, that era, and it was kind of interesting because

18:04.790 --> 18:16.654
In teaching gross anatomy, the dog gross was taught in the fall, large animal gross was taught in the spring, and those were two freshmen or first-year veterinary students.

18:16.715 --> 18:23.288
The second-year students in the third or summer semester got the applied anatomy.

18:23.875 --> 18:26.359
they were burned out.

18:26.379 --> 18:40.661
It was a very interesting contrast to watch the enthusiasm of the first year, tampered a little bit by the second semester, but really burned out by the sixth semester of constant school.

18:41.782 --> 18:46.069
Now, how did the program here, as you understood it in those areas,

18:46.319 --> 18:49.384
How did that compare with your experience back at Minnesota?

18:49.404 --> 18:50.405
The program is different.

18:50.485 --> 18:53.350
My experience was on a quarter system.

18:53.390 --> 18:57.416
So we had three quarters and ended around the first of June.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.941
We got our summers off to work or do whatever.

19:02.443 --> 19:10.335
The semester program meant basically going year- or trimester program meant basically going year-round.

19:10.923 --> 19:14.176
While from a teaching standpoint, it didn't make a lot of difference.

19:14.216 --> 19:16.264
I was going to be doing something anyway.

19:16.967 --> 19:21.203
You could certainly see the devastation that it was having on the students.

19:21.453 --> 19:26.279
And how did the students here compare with the students at Minnesota?

19:26.299 --> 19:27.220
Oh, students are students.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.481
They're all wonderful people.

19:30.123 --> 19:36.050
There's always that enthusiasm, which is the fun part about working with freshmen, because there is an enthusiasm.

19:36.090 --> 19:37.572
They're wonderful people.

19:38.312 --> 19:42.717
Not that they aren't wonderful by the time that they're seniors, but they're different by the time that they're seniors.

19:43.699 --> 19:49.445
So I always enjoyed that enthusiasm, the wanting to learn, because this is what we came for.

19:49.505 --> 19:50.987
This is what we want to do.

19:51.254 --> 19:56.663
All right, now, you equated them in their enthusiasm and so forth.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.947
Was there a difference in their background?

19:58.987 --> 20:04.155
Were there more urban kids up in Minnesota and more rural here?

20:04.215 --> 20:14.933
No, at the time, the rural and urban is more a timing factor and a date factor as opposed to

20:16.094 --> 20:17.716
the influence of location.

20:18.317 --> 20:25.468
We were seeing farm kids and rural students coming in in Minnesota as well as down here.

20:25.928 --> 20:34.120
The change has occurred as grades became a more important selection criteria.

20:35.872 --> 20:47.389
So that the students that came from a rural background often didn't have, not that they weren't bright and didn't have experiences, but grades were not important.

20:47.409 --> 20:53.458
They came from smaller schools and were not often as competitive in a college situation.

20:53.598 --> 21:01.390
And so that's when we started seeing the change to more urban students.

21:02.602 --> 21:09.394
And let's see, your assignment was to teach what?

21:09.414 --> 21:14.543
My assignment was to teach actually all three types of gross anatomy.

21:14.843 --> 21:17.548
And that was normally to first-year students?

21:18.109 --> 21:27.445
The dog and large animal anatomy is taught to first-year students, and the applied anatomy would be taught to second-year students, sixth trimester students.

21:27.762 --> 21:33.908
Right now, describe how you worked full-time but also worked on your own degree.

21:34.765 --> 21:39.734
We were allowed to take four hours of class time while we worked full time.

21:39.774 --> 21:40.455
Per semester?

21:40.475 --> 21:41.216
Per semester.

21:41.637 --> 21:44.542
So each semester, I'd find some kind of class to go to.

21:45.083 --> 21:51.113
And my degree was in medicine and surgery, small animal medicine and surgery.

21:51.213 --> 22:00.469
And so I took classes primarily over in the small animal department, plus research and so on.

22:01.310 --> 22:19.565
which to me was really, it helped me teach in the applied anatomy course, it kept my hands in the clinics, it gave me an opportunity to get to know the clinicians at the other end of the building very well.

22:19.865 --> 22:23.993
So I felt comfortable really around all the faculty.

22:24.226 --> 22:30.855
Because of my horse interest, I was out in large animal as much as I was anywhere else, and I was going to be teaching that.

22:30.895 --> 22:37.104
So I needed to know what kinds of things they were doing and, you know, kind of keep my fingers everywhere.

22:37.685 --> 22:40.629
All right, now you were working, did you do a master's degree first?

22:40.769 --> 22:41.831
I did a master's degree.

22:42.472 --> 22:44.575
And who was your thesis advisor?

22:45.916 --> 22:47.078
Ned Ellett.

22:47.193 --> 22:48.375
was here at that time.

22:49.516 --> 22:52.420
Ned was chair of the small animal department at the time.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.441
He was my chair.

22:53.562 --> 22:57.887
Dean Gage was on my committee, and Charlie Hall was on my committee.

22:57.907 --> 22:59.490
And your thesis topic?

22:59.810 --> 23:04.036
Was on EEGs in normal anesthetized cats.

23:04.576 --> 23:05.057
Cats.

23:05.077 --> 23:05.398
Cats.

23:05.858 --> 23:07.260
That had never been done.

23:07.240 --> 23:13.388
Charlie Hall and Bill Clem had done dogs, but the cat had not been done.

23:13.728 --> 23:14.830
So it was a good step.

23:14.850 --> 23:19.656
And about how long did it take to do that?

23:19.676 --> 23:21.879
It took three years to do that.

23:22.460 --> 23:23.321
So I graduated.

23:23.341 --> 23:26.164
I got my degree in some class of 72.

23:26.244 --> 23:28.808
Then you're a PhD.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.810
Did not do a PhD.

23:33.594 --> 23:36.758
By that time, I had developed an interest in animal behavior.

23:37.193 --> 23:43.980
And there wasn't a program on campus that really would allow me to develop that.

23:44.901 --> 23:54.811
And it turns out I ended up being really one of the pioneers in the veterinary behavior aspects of it because it hadn't been developed.

23:54.851 --> 23:55.492
Describe that.

23:56.733 --> 24:03.420
Well, first of all, I've been described as the grandmother of, not the mother of, but the grandmother of veterinary behavior.

24:03.755 --> 24:17.629
Back in the very early 70s, there was a dog club in Harlingen, Texas that called the department and said they wanted somebody to come down and talk about behavior.

24:19.043 --> 24:26.878
And I don't remember how I happened to get the call, but I thought, you know, I've read about this as a senior veterinary student.

24:26.918 --> 24:28.701
I know as much about it as anybody.

24:29.002 --> 24:29.503
I'll do it.

24:29.983 --> 24:32.448
And they also wanted some on confirmation.

24:32.789 --> 24:34.792
Well, confirmation is applied anatomy.

24:35.273 --> 24:40.984
And that is an area that I've certainly had an interest in primarily because of horse, but it

24:40.964 --> 24:43.808
obviously related to dog as well.

24:43.868 --> 24:45.170
So I thought I can do this.

24:45.611 --> 24:57.769
So I went down and started and I thought you know this is kind of interesting and got to do more reading and started picking up some research money and did some research projects in various aspects of behavior.

24:58.169 --> 25:01.234
Did a lot of just kind of observing and

25:01.568 --> 25:09.049
you know, low budget types of research projects and that kind of became my area of expertise.

25:09.069 --> 25:17.232
So, and RACIS was very generous in allowing faculty to pursue those kinds of areas.

25:17.212 --> 25:23.079
helped and encouraged me to look at different areas of behavior.

25:23.380 --> 25:33.853
It fit in with neuro and the EEG types of things we could find and because of it actually found some abnormal behavior patterns that really have a neurological basis.

25:33.993 --> 25:36.056
So was able to develop that.

25:36.276 --> 25:38.019
And that began about when?

25:38.039 --> 25:40.422
That was in the very early 70s.

25:41.563 --> 25:44.687
Continued to develop gradually and then

25:45.275 --> 25:55.766
By the mid-'80s, I actually developed an allergy to formaldehyde, which doesn't work real well being a gross anatomist and having that kind of allergy.

25:56.267 --> 25:59.130
So I was put into the histology lab.

25:59.150 --> 26:02.254
Well, I've never done real well with microscopic things.

26:02.994 --> 26:09.021
And it was OK, but it truly wasn't where my interests or love were.

26:09.001 --> 26:18.836
At that time, George Shelton was dean of the college, and he decided that, you know, it's time for behavior to get to the clinics.

26:18.856 --> 26:24.505
And he literally moved my position into the Department of Small Animal Medicine Surgery.

26:24.906 --> 26:31.937
I came in on a year's trial basis, both ways, and it worked out.

26:31.917 --> 26:39.885
A couple of years later, I was appointed as chair of the medicine section within that department and have been there ever since.

26:40.237 --> 26:48.633
describe to an outsider the clinic operation, the small animal clinic operation?

26:48.653 --> 26:49.995
Oh, the clinic operation.

26:50.136 --> 27:03.561
The clinics, when I first came, basically were in the old building, which has since been remodeled, but they were old concrete cages, kind of gloomy, but

27:04.300 --> 27:06.387
reasonably serviceable at the time.

27:06.507 --> 27:13.450
Shortly thereafter, the new small animal clinic, which isn't so new anymore, but was built,

27:14.695 --> 27:37.914
Two stories, lots of office space, wonderful cage space, and it's interesting to watch over time how a facility that works really well in one era, the demands of the profession change, the needs change, and so now we're looking at remodeling a building that had worked quite well at one time.

27:38.875 --> 27:44.500
The new

27:44.783 --> 27:52.617
types of disciplines within small animal parallel the changes that have occurred in human medicine.

27:53.069 --> 28:21.169
and so it's very fun for me to watch the evolution of veterinary medicine as a whole and certainly small animal medicine and surgery in particular over time there are disciplines that i mean you didn't think of a discipline cardiologists weren't cardiologists at that time ken kenauer had come shortly before i had

28:21.149 --> 28:23.957
and really kind of started developing cardiology.

28:24.538 --> 28:30.054
You didn't have orthopedic surgeons and soft tissue surgeons and neurosurgeons.

28:30.074 --> 28:30.876
You had surgeons.

28:31.277 --> 28:36.913
Well, it didn't take very long before they started becoming a separate group.

28:37.417 --> 28:42.426
have internists, and now you do.

28:43.488 --> 28:50.880
Within the internists, you didn't have the GI folks and the urology folks and the neurology folks, but now you do.

28:52.383 --> 28:58.193
This whole discipline of veterinary medicine has changed the specialties.

28:58.645 --> 29:07.756
Even today, only about 10% of veterinarians are specialists, contrasted to about 85% of human physicians are, in fact, specialists.

29:08.156 --> 29:13.943
So the demand is slowly growing as people have more income to spend on their pets.

29:14.724 --> 29:16.286
The pet has changed.

29:16.906 --> 29:19.369
It used to be the farm dog and the farm cat.

29:19.389 --> 29:20.531
We don't spend money on them.

29:20.811 --> 29:22.493
They're lucky if they get their shots.

29:22.473 --> 29:29.443
Now they're family members, and so we'll spend anything, any amount of money on our animal.

29:30.284 --> 29:35.051
That has driven specialties within veterinary medicine.

29:35.071 --> 29:40.479
On that, let's grab onto that change.

29:40.519 --> 29:49.712
Early in your experience here, the typical animal brought to the small animal clinic was what brought by whom?

29:49.861 --> 29:55.709
The typical animal was still a pet, but it usually was the dog that lived in the backyard.

29:56.531 --> 30:06.044
It was brought often by the wife because at that time, most women still were not working outside of the home.

30:06.144 --> 30:07.366
Was it a purebred?

30:07.606 --> 30:09.229
No, it usually was a mutt.

30:09.369 --> 30:14.957
We saw purebreds, but that has obviously changed over time.

30:15.562 --> 30:21.133
And today we see as many cats as we do dogs.

30:22.595 --> 30:28.928
Many of the cats are purebred, although certainly it's a much higher population of dogs that are purebreds that come in.

30:29.669 --> 30:32.254
They could be brought by either

30:32.673 --> 30:34.155
by any family member.

30:34.195 --> 30:36.779
In fact, sometimes it's the children that bring them in.

30:38.081 --> 30:44.111
Often we, of course, here we see college students and they have now their first pet.

30:45.012 --> 30:50.040
Sometimes it is an animal that was their family pet and they brought it to school with them.

30:50.020 --> 30:52.243
Sometimes it's one that they have gotten.

30:52.984 --> 30:58.872
And so the type of education that we do to that individual is very different.

30:58.892 --> 31:01.416
They've never had a dog or cat before.

31:02.056 --> 31:03.679
They don't know about feeding.

31:03.739 --> 31:05.020
They don't know about shots.

31:05.101 --> 31:07.684
They don't know about good health care prevention.

31:08.465 --> 31:11.269
We have new diseases that we didn't have back then.
