WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:06.112
And those particular jokes were excluded from 
that issue. The

00:08.514 --> 00:18.703
battalion in those days did not see its role as 
primarily investigative journalism, I assume.

00:19.204 --> 00:21.746
What did you all think the purpose was of the 
battalion? Well, it was the official newspaper of

00:22.026 --> 00:25.409
College Station. They would give us, I think, 
their legal ads. And we would print them. And then

00:34.871 --> 00:49.005
of course it got some, we had also national 
advertising, that's how we made it, the national

00:34.871 --> 00:49.005
advertising, primarily cigarettes

00:34.871 --> 00:49.005
that were allocated just to the newspaper without 
much solicitation. Then we had local

00:53.429 --> 00:57.714
advertisers, too, that came in there. And

00:57.814 --> 01:08.064
we could write editorials, and we'd have letters 
to the editor and things like that. Did you all ever

01:09.566 --> 01:14.571
have a tangle with the administration over any 
issue? Other than the jokes? No, the jokes, that's

01:18.040 --> 01:21.764
the last one, because that was a non-winner. Now, 
at the time you were an undergraduate, is Dr.

01:23.305 --> 01:30.133
Walton the president? President. Describe him as 
president. He was an excellent speaker and a fine

01:34.958 --> 01:41.445
gentleman. During that last year, He gave us a

01:45.382 --> 01:59.579
one-hour credit course where we would go once a 
week to listen to his lecture on current affairs or

01:45.382 --> 01:59.579
something like that. And he had actual contact 
with the student body. As I recall, it was an

02:04.645 --> 02:14.157
elective course, but he would come and lecture 
himself. Now, and he had been at A&M a long time,

02:15.284 --> 02:17.947
hadn't he? A long time. So that he knew the student 
body and so forth. They lived on campus in the... In

02:25.477 --> 02:29.381
the old... President's house west of Sabeasa. 
Yeah. And I presume that you had known him and he had

02:30.483 --> 02:35.469
known you for a number of years. That would be true. 
In fact, I remember... as just a kid growing up, I

02:43.685 --> 03:02.946
would sell magazines

02:43.685 --> 03:02.946
through Crowell Publishing Company, who had 
Woman's Home, Compadion, Collier's, and

02:43.685 --> 03:02.946
American Magazine. And I would sell those on the 
campus, and I would also call on the ladies, and I

03:09.892 --> 03:25.918
remember Mrs. Walton and I would, she would be 
interested in the Woman's Home Companion, and I

03:09.892 --> 03:25.918
can always recall that that was the first air 
conditioning on the campus, in fact, it was their

03:09.892 --> 03:25.918
home. And it was really something extraordinary 
to call on her and feel that cool air coming out.

03:42.175 --> 03:51.187
Back to your student days, if you needed 
counseling, if you needed advising when you were

03:42.175 --> 03:51.187
an A&M undergraduate, to whom did you turn? I

03:51.207 --> 04:02.342
don't think they had any local, I mean any student

04:05.242 --> 04:17.380
Counseling, you could turn to the

04:05.242 --> 04:17.380
TAC officer for your particular organization.

04:18.402 --> 04:23.469
We had Colonel Bennett, Major Breland, and Major 
Hudson. They were Coast artillerymen. You could

04:26.333 --> 04:31.401
consult with them.

04:32.528 --> 04:35.112
I don't know of any formal. There wasn't an 
assistant or associate dean of arts and sciences

04:35.552 --> 04:40.640
that you went over to? For academics, maybe, or the 
head of the department. You could consult with him

04:48.110 --> 04:53.098
academically, but there was no formal. The only 
thing that I recall when I went through was that

04:54.520 --> 05:00.308
your freshman year you had a, a battery of tests

05:01.233 --> 05:13.431
that you took, and I guess they were put on your 
record someplace in the registrar's office.

05:13.451 --> 05:19.720
Somebody could use to advise you if you were 
changing courses or something like that. Were you

05:19.740 --> 05:22.144
listed officially as a history major?

05:26.579 --> 05:28.221
No, liberal arts. Just liberal arts? I majored in 
history and minored in English. Okay. So many

05:33.749 --> 05:36.694
hours for a major, so many hours for a minor. And the 
YMCA, what did you and other students, what role

05:38.076 --> 05:46.929
did it play in your activity, your life? Well, it 
was not so much if you had some kind of local, Church

05:54.406 --> 06:07.842
affiliation, you know, most of the cadets or 
students would join their church, you know, from

05:54.406 --> 06:07.842
their family church when they came to A&M. And on a 
Sunday morning, it was just a sea of khaki coming

06:08.122 --> 06:15.231
out of the North Gate back to the campus. Now, did 
you go to church on Sunday with your family or with

06:16.212 --> 06:21.038
your buddies? I went to church at the First Baptist 
Church and would see student friends and Father.

06:28.703 --> 06:31.666
But, I mean, did you walk over there with your 
friends? Oh, yeah, yeah. And you were allowed to

06:34.610 --> 06:36.912
sit with them and not with Mom and Dad? Oh, yeah, I 
didn't have to. But those were student churches.

06:43.500 --> 06:51.008
Wasn't the YMCA also a center for activities other 
than the YMCA building? Yes, they had the YMCA

06:52.523 --> 06:59.912
Council, and that was made up of students. The only 
other religious activity they had was a religious

07:01.013 --> 07:17.774
emphasis week sometime in the spring, as I recall, 
shortly after classes resumed from the holidays.

07:19.155 --> 07:21.518
They would have a week-long session of visiting

07:22.325 --> 07:33.856
ministers that would come in and they would have a 
convocation each day at 11 o'clock or something

07:22.325 --> 07:33.856
like that. And then they had emphasis with the 
local churches. Did you and your buddies

07:38.520 --> 07:40.622
participate in that pretty well? We'd go hear the 
lecture

07:41.323 --> 07:46.247
or the formal. And that was in Guyon Hall? Guyon 
Hall, old Guyon Hall. What else occurred in Guyon

07:49.830 --> 07:51.572
Hall? Well, at one time, when I was there, after 
World War II, they made a movie theater out of it.

08:02.134 --> 08:03.415
But it was not in your day? Not in our day. We had the 
Assembly Hall, the old Assembly Hall over there

08:04.396 --> 08:14.326
behind Law and Puryear, before we get to Law and 
Puryear. Do you remember any great movies, great

08:14.346 --> 08:21.053
in your memory that you saw at the Assembly Hall? 
Oh, no, I can't. I guess, I don't recall, except

08:25.040 --> 08:41.202
they had on Sunday afternoon a free movie at one 
o'clock, you know, and you could, that was for the

08:25.040 --> 08:41.202
entire corps, and if you were lucky, well, you 
could, you know, slip in there and Well, they

08:41.182 --> 08:43.846
didn't charge. It was a free move. As I'm turning 
through some of my kind of routine questions, do

08:45.809 --> 08:55.024
you remember in your undergraduate days any 
famous visitors to the campus? President

08:55.425 --> 08:56.326
Roosevelt. No, that wasn't during my 
undergraduate days. That was in the 30s.

09:02.556 --> 09:06.362
President Roosevelt came because his...

09:08.485 --> 09:35.860
son was on the board of directors as i recall was it 
elliot or i believe i believe it was elliot from who

09:08.485 --> 09:35.860
lived in fort worth or someplace maybe i don't know 
anyway he made a visit and i recall that of course he

09:08.485 --> 09:35.860
came by train and uh yeah of course he he'd been an 
invalid like he was you couldn't take any pictures

09:36.970 --> 09:58.455
But I do know that there was a,

09:36.970 --> 09:58.455
on the reviewing stand, on the drill field, that 
when the Corps passed in review for him, that they

09:36.970 --> 09:58.455
had a specially made handrail for him to stand.

09:59.954 --> 10:05.606
I think he just came at noon and left at 3 or 
something like that on some kind of a tour. Now,

10:06.527 --> 10:12.259
were you and your family aware of how physically 
handicapped he was then? I was not as a little kid. I

10:17.481 --> 10:27.594
don't think anybody was actually because they 
really protected that affliction all through his

10:17.481 --> 10:27.594
career. As far as you recall, he did not then make a 
formal speech. He did a review? I don't recall. But

10:37.138 --> 10:42.146
I do know that he did review the cadet corps. Other 
famous visitors you remember during your

10:42.166 --> 10:45.571
undergraduate days?

10:48.395 --> 10:49.396
Well, there weren't too many. They all came 
afterwards. Oh, yeah, I do remember. I've seen a

10:52.902 --> 10:56.607
year.

10:59.135 --> 11:05.383
We had two, well, they weren't dignitaries, they 
were just ex-A&M officers.

11:08.968 --> 11:15.937
Ensign Gay was a member of A Battery Coast.

11:18.540 --> 11:28.093
After he was rescued from the

11:18.540 --> 11:28.093
Pacific, he made a visit to the campus. Really? And 
he was still an ensign at the time. And he visited

11:34.568 --> 11:37.211
around in the Corps. And at the same time, a

11:37.291 --> 11:54.592
B-25 pilot in Doolittle's raid over Japan named 
Hilger, he was an older graduate of A&M, he

11:37.291 --> 11:54.592
returned to the campus. And that was in the summer 
of 42.

11:59.395 --> 12:03.980
And famous visitors, what about some of the 
orchestras and other men? Oh, we had for the Grove,

12:04.000 --> 12:24.062
the inauguration of the Grove, which was a little 
social place in that summer, we had the famous Ina

12:04.000 --> 12:24.062
Rae Hutton All-Girl Orchestra. They came and 
played for that. And then there were some good

12:26.564 --> 12:35.779
orchestras that came to A&M for core dances during 
those times.

12:40.766 --> 12:48.318
But, you know, I'd have to be... Oh, and of course 
that time also they were making this movie, We've

12:40.766 --> 12:48.318
Never Been Licked. That was during the summer of 
42. when we had the corps for the movie take would

12:55.893 --> 13:10.853
have to assemble every afternoon for a week, and 
that got boring and tiresome. In fact, by the end of

13:12.375 --> 13:16.821
the week, the ranks were rather slim. But let's 
see, who was that? Robert Mitchum. Robert

13:23.493 --> 13:24.514
Mitchum. Anne...

13:26.116 --> 13:33.083
Bancroft? Martha O'Driscoll was one. So you were a 
movie star then because you were out there in that

13:38.329 --> 13:46.217
movie, weren't you? For a couple of days I was, and 
then I left it. Do you remember your impression

13:50.592 --> 13:54.180
when you first saw that movie? Well, you tried to 
recall where you were, if you could point yourself

13:56.444 --> 14:02.637
out and all, and I In fact, I've got a copy at home now 
that I got way, way, I mean, just a few years ago. It

14:09.484 --> 14:14.873
was a little corny, actually. It had an amazing 
seeming, pretty authentic in places. But didn't

14:19.640 --> 14:25.509
you and your fellow students think that you were 
being part of something patriotic? Oh, yeah,

14:25.990 --> 14:28.033
yeah, absolutely. How much did... The best thing 
about that show was I believe they had the true

14:30.277 --> 14:34.642
Reveille in it. The little black doll. The true 
Reveille. When did... Let's sidelight on

14:39.147 --> 14:43.392
Reveille. As far as you're aware, when did the 
first Reveille come to the campus?

14:51.942 --> 14:52.603
As I... Remember the story, some students were 
coming back from Navasota one night or one

14:52.887 --> 15:03.623
afternoon and they saw this injured animal on the 
road or something. They picked her up and brought

15:03.703 --> 15:06.126
her back to the campus. Was that in your elementary 
school days? No, I think that was about in high

15:11.467 --> 15:14.873
school days. Oh, okay. Shortly before I entered 
A&M. All right, while we're on that tradition,

15:20.241 --> 15:35.466
while you were, before you went away to World War 
II, do you remember Muster, Aggie Muster? You

15:37.640 --> 15:39.022
know, that's a good question. I don't want to be 
disrespectful, but I don't think that it really

15:39.183 --> 15:57.632
was reinstituted or came about until they 
observed it during the war at Corregidor. I agree

15:58.274 --> 15:59.696
with your impression. I think that it was... quite 
modest until World War II, and then, all right. The

16:10.681 --> 16:30.782
only thing that I could associate with it would be 
that on November the 11th, which was Armistice Day

16:10.681 --> 16:30.782
for World War I, the cadet colonel's staff would 
place a wreath at the monument on the campus to the

16:31.994 --> 16:35.457
World War I dead. But I just, you know, I just don't 
recall it. All right. Describe bonfire during

16:42.363 --> 16:45.145
your undergraduate days. It was a trash fire. The 
main activity was reclaiming

16:48.048 --> 17:01.900
wood or buildings or outhouses primarily that 
should not be burned. And it was held on what is now

17:02.453 --> 17:07.179
the drill field in front of the MSC. Correct. And 
who gathered up all of that rubbish? Students. Was

17:13.826 --> 17:14.807
it all students? Prowling. Now, they may have had 
some

17:16.870 --> 17:27.542
trees or limbs or rubbish or something like that 
delivered there, but it just came about. It wasn't

17:28.203 --> 17:31.667
near the...

17:33.301 --> 17:35.285
activity that now. And was there a gathering of 
pretty well the whole student body and speeches

17:35.866 --> 17:42.339
and so forth? That was the most interesting was to 
listen to old Yale leaders come back and make a

17:42.740 --> 17:51.197
speech or to hear somebody like P.L. Downs Jr. who 
was a Big Aggie would make a speech, you know. The

17:56.726 --> 17:58.609
football team would make a speech. And that was 
more interesting than going through all this

17:59.310 --> 18:05.759
activity and building a huge bonfire. All right, 
you mentioned Pinky. He was not yet back in College

18:08.744 --> 18:13.971
Station full-time, was he, when you were an 
undergraduate? When I got here in 1959, he was here

18:15.353 --> 18:19.139
full-time on the campus. On the campus. I believe 
that's correct. And I've been told by a few people

18:23.464 --> 18:48.651
that they think that Pinky deserves most of the 
credit for using the thumbs-up signal for Gig'Em,

18:23.464 --> 18:48.651
that that was the old symbol for the yell aimed 
particularly at TCU, to gig those frogs.

18:49.475 --> 18:53.000
that there was a Rice Yale and an SMU Yale and so 
forth. As I recall, that motion was given by the

18:55.484 --> 19:08.084
Yale leaders when they, one, two, three,

18:55.484 --> 19:08.084
to be associated. You could be correct about that. 
I don't know. Let's see. But it's just like this

19:18.061 --> 19:20.044
whoop. That didn't occur in my day. I didn't know. 
That's relatively new. Well, and within the last

19:26.455 --> 19:34.268
15, 18 years, the waving of the white towel. Oh, 
that's new. Then the yell, which I don't like at

19:36.111 --> 19:40.899
all, beat the hell out of. That started in the late 
70s. No, I think that we used to say that. Oh, did

19:49.872 --> 19:50.292
you? Oh, okay. We used to tell out of so-and-so, and 
that, I think, could be attributed to the yellator

19:52.034 --> 20:02.804
named Buster Keaton way back there in the 39-40 in 
that era.

20:06.127 --> 20:13.414
But, of course, you know, one thing that I'd like to 
see bring back would be the the block tee that the

20:13.917 --> 20:18.582
Cadet Corps made at football games. Yes, yes. And 
that's where that you would have a handkerchief

20:19.844 --> 20:29.575
would be white and then you'd pick up a red flag and 
you could alternate those. You see that? That was

20:30.336 --> 20:32.458
pretty good. But I don't guess they've attempted 
that in years. I don't remember it. Do you remember

20:36.952 --> 20:38.394
ever seeing it? Yes, a long time ago. When you were 
an undergraduate, other than the Corps of Cadets,

20:40.937 --> 20:52.852
what were the other student organizations that 
were most respected, most admired?

20:55.956 --> 21:05.068
Well, I want to say that they had a

20:55.956 --> 21:05.068
scholarship honor society. Now, it didn't take a 
whole lot to get in there, but you did have to be a

21:06.618 --> 21:19.175
distinguished student for so many semesters or 
something like that. And to be a distinguished

21:19.295 --> 21:25.243
student on the three-point system, you had to have 
a 2.25. That was an organization that had good

21:26.465 --> 21:34.195
students in it. The other one, I guess, would be the 
Letterman's Association, which would be the

21:36.318 --> 21:43.946
athletic group. What did you and your fellow 
students think about the band and the singing

21:44.587 --> 21:48.851
cadets? The band was recognized. It wasn't the 
Fightin' Texas Aggie Band. It was the band, you

21:58.101 --> 22:02.646
see.

22:04.600 --> 22:08.286
The senior cadets were good. It was very 
voluntary. And they didn't have the uniforms that

22:11.151 --> 22:20.446
they do now and the trips that they make and the 
promotion that they did get. But it started way

22:21.047 --> 22:22.890
back there then. Mr. Wolcott, I remember, he put a 
whole lot of time into that. Let's see. Do you know

22:30.449 --> 22:37.020
whether or not there were any secret fraternities 
in existence when you were a student? When I was a

22:39.023 --> 22:48.379
student,

22:39.023 --> 22:48.379
I did not know of any organization. I came to learn 
later that there may have been some that existed

22:51.344 --> 22:55.829
for any number of years. But I don't know. I

22:58.192 --> 23:10.367
have learned that apparently the stickers or the 
swastikas goes back at least to the 20s. The

23:11.188 --> 23:12.149
swastikas. And the TTs apparently go back fairly 
far also. And as far as I can learn about Almost

23:22.732 --> 23:36.589
their total activity was designed to get their own 
members into key positions, that there was

23:22.732 --> 23:36.589
nothing negative, that it was to try to encourage 
positive leadership. Let's see. Senior Boots,

23:39.873 --> 23:43.999
where did you get yours and how much did they cost? 
Hollick Boot Shop, Northgate.

23:50.266 --> 23:51.608
As I recall, They were about $80 or $90. Which was a 
lot of money. Well, at that time, I don't know what

23:57.594 --> 23:59.777
they cost now. I have no idea. And how did you feel 
when you first put them on? Well, you felt pretty

24:07.104 --> 24:11.929
good because at that time, let's see, you had...

24:15.212 --> 24:17.255
Between your junior and... I mean, your sophomore 
and junior year, you discarded...

24:23.110 --> 24:33.683
government-issue uniform and put on a tailored 
uniform that you had gotten, you see. Juniors, you

24:34.744 --> 24:38.389
start wearing cuffs, of course. Then they went out 
during the war and wore greens and a blouse. And

24:47.680 --> 24:50.704
then your senior year, you could wear boots or ice 
cream trousers, we called them.

24:57.660 --> 25:04.778
That's the only thing that I recall about it.

25:07.137 --> 25:13.303
Everything was leading up to where you could use 
that blouse, your senior blouse, if you were

25:07.137 --> 25:13.303
commissioned later on. Now,

25:13.803 --> 25:26.115
in terms of status,

25:13.803 --> 25:26.115
what student office was the most sought, the most 
admired? Was it Corps Commander? Cadet Colonel.

25:29.699 --> 25:30.059
Cadet. All right. Ross Volunteers, they existed 
then? They did. They did. It was... Strictly kind

25:36.432 --> 25:44.622
of an elective and voluntary, you could get into 
it. They were more or less social, primarily

25:44.662 --> 25:56.797
social, actually, because they had one whole 
weekend where they had dances and parties. What

25:57.778 --> 25:59.580
about yell leaders? They were elected. Let's see. 
The top, I guess, would be cadet colonel, and then

26:05.103 --> 26:19.264
we had a position of president of the senior class,

26:05.103 --> 26:19.264
head yell leader. Those were particular 
positions that were Salt. Describe, as far as you

26:27.619 --> 26:36.249
recall, the project houses and what they meant to 
A&M students. Well, the project houses were the

26:37.711 --> 26:53.149
baby of Dr. Dan Russell, who organized them, and it 
meant a whole lot

26:37.711 --> 26:53.149
to the college. provided an opportunity for guys 
to come down and go to school on a cooperative

26:53.585 --> 27:00.635
basis. And I remember some members over there, 
well, one of the more recent ones that we recall is

27:01.717 --> 27:14.235
Reagan Brown was in the project houses. And there 
were a lot of good students that went through that.

27:18.141 --> 27:21.827
Was there any kind of stigma attached to it? None 
whatsoever. In fact, the American Legion had its

27:24.365 --> 27:31.296
own house, too. They built one. It's torn down now, 
but the project houses were uniformly built. And

27:39.349 --> 27:45.799
even before they existed on the campus, they had, I 
think, a couple here in Bryan. Did you ever go away

27:47.855 --> 27:52.043
for any kind of summer job? No, sir. And then what 
would have been summer ROTC camp for you and your

27:55.409 --> 28:05.808
class, you stayed here and went faster. Did you 
ever hitchhike? I have hit tight on occasion,

28:10.568 --> 28:13.312
but... Describe that for an Aggie. That was quite 
an opportunity. That could be where the signal

28:18.459 --> 28:29.313
picked up, but it was very controlled. In other 
words, if you reached a point, if you put your...

28:35.273 --> 28:39.679
bagged down while you were next in line, and that 
was respected. Whoever got there first, there

28:40.219 --> 28:55.359
were certain main corners that were used, and of 
course the famous, what was his name, the famous

28:40.219 --> 28:55.359
guy that hitchhiked all over the United States 
from A&M. Good gracious. He made a name for

29:00.468 --> 29:01.910
himself. I've not heard about him, so when you 
recall his name, we'll add him in the final type

29:02.031 --> 29:10.184
version of this. Did you ever have any negative 
experience hitchhiking as an Aggie? I never did.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.520
Did you ever hear of anybody did? I have not. I 
haven't heard of any time when somebody, I've

29:21.382 --> 29:27.792
heard of lots of times when they stepped in to 
assist somebody You know, but I've never heard of

29:27.890 --> 29:32.315
any adverse circumstance where anybody was.

29:36.099 --> 29:42.485
If you were, I understand the East Gate was the 
place to go north or south. Was there a special

29:43.727 --> 29:49.373
place if we were in Bryan to catch a ride on north?

29:54.338 --> 29:55.399
Let's see.

29:58.687 --> 30:13.667
Well, Highway 6,

29:58.687 --> 30:13.667
I'm just thinking at a corner not far from the 
courthouse going north was a corner. Okay. About

30:15.910 --> 30:22.358
at 26th Street or 25th Street, something like 
that. And going south, 25th Street was a corner

30:22.398 --> 30:27.445
there. at the courthouse going south. But you 
know, there were no east and west roads like they

30:33.686 --> 30:37.529
are today. Now,

30:37.569 --> 30:44.116
did you ever have a car as an undergraduate? Never 
had a car.

30:47.679 --> 30:56.487
In fact, when my freshman year, I think you could 
have parked the cars in a

30:47.679 --> 30:56.487
two-acre lot. for all the students on campus who 
had behavior. Did you have any special

31:01.266 --> 31:09.038
out-of-town dates come to the campus when you were 
an undergraduate?

31:11.642 --> 31:14.847
Yes, I recall for
