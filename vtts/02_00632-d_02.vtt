00:15.218 --> 00:22.389
First of all, now, about breakwater, what do you 
mean it's an altogether different principle or

00:15.218 --> 00:22.389
principle conceived of differently than it's 
been in the past? Well, in the past, the whole

00:22.409 --> 00:33.987
matter of defending, let's say, a coast or a harbor 
against waves has been to pile in a lot of rock. This

00:35.536 --> 00:38.801
does some absorption, some reflection. It 
interferes with sand flow. It can be disastrous.

00:43.187 --> 00:44.428
It's irreversible. There's no way to really tear 
it down once it's built. We see these kinds of

00:47.393 --> 00:54.382
disasters all around the world where it's set up 
waves of beach erosion. There's a static approach

00:54.402 --> 01:03.535
of sitting up there obstructing the waves by 
putting in a massive... chunks of rocks,

01:04.915 --> 01:09.721
sometimes wired together and cemented together. 
This is a much more subtle way of destroying waves,

01:10.903 --> 01:18.012
which is to set something that causes the waves to 
destroy themselves. It's driven by the pressure

01:19.354 --> 01:23.199
field and acts against the orbits of the wave. And 
what you want is the least dense material rather

01:24.241 --> 01:31.210
than the most dense material. You want it to have 
the greatest freedom of motion rather than the

01:32.236 --> 01:37.721
least freedom of motion. And it truly degrades the 
waves into eddies, rather than reflecting it to a

01:37.741 --> 01:46.950
great extent, you see. This is why the approaches 
to some coasts, to breakwaters, are rather

01:47.530 --> 01:53.456
dangerous, because you have these highly 
reflected waves. So it's a totally different

01:55.298 --> 01:56.719
principle. But I don't really limit it to that. The 
whole business of intervening into the phase of

02:00.367 --> 02:08.417
the wave rather than the orbits of the wave is quite 
a different approach. You have linked yourself

02:09.619 --> 02:14.966
into something that is, in principle, much more 
energetic. That isn't quite the right way to say

02:16.888 --> 02:22.155
it, but rather that The velocities involved are 
much higher than they are. The rate at which the

02:25.578 --> 02:31.306
wave form is going across the ocean is much higher 
than the rate at which the water is moving. Even

02:31.906 --> 02:34.429
Leonardo da Vinci understood that quite well. I 
mean, what I mean even. Leonardo da Vinci

02:36.933 --> 02:39.896
understood that one quite well. But see, if you can 
link things into this rapid motion of the velocity

02:46.317 --> 02:48.981
of the waveform across the ocean. And so there's a 
magnitude greater than the actual water motion.

02:53.167 --> 02:59.056
Most things, like a rubble mount breakwater, 
intervene with a orbital motion, a smaller

02:53.167 --> 02:59.056
motion. This intervenes into the waveform 
itself. Now, if you can link that in so you get

03:03.583 --> 03:09.051
energy out also, then you've done a much more 
effective job. You ordinarily only see this kind

03:11.242 --> 03:16.287
of linkage in the case of surfboarding, for 
example. And then it's much degraded because it's

03:16.307 --> 03:19.690
been much slowed down. But the velocities that are 
involved, you can already see are very high. But if

03:25.476 --> 03:29.841
you can do this in the open sea, you see you're 
talking about velocities of 40 and 50 miles an

03:25.476 --> 03:29.841
hour. You've linked to the pressure gradient.

03:36.267 --> 03:39.871
I know one can't say when an idea first came to him 
along this way. I realize that. But roughly when

03:41.752 --> 03:45.576
did you begin to work on the problem in terms of... 
Which one? The problem of... The breakwater? The

03:48.079 --> 03:53.464
breakwater problem.

03:53.484 --> 04:04.195
Well, I'd always had this in mind, more or less, in a 
kind of a vague, unformed, diaphanous way, since

03:53.484 --> 04:04.195
I'd worked on the torpedo net problem. And every 
time I saw... Every time I saw... buoys that were

04:11.215 --> 04:13.878
partly hauled down. I was always impressed by 
their tremendously erratic motion. And then I

04:20.346 --> 04:25.752
went talking about it in class. And I said, why 
don't we just really see? Why doesn't somebody

04:29.536 --> 04:38.927
take the project to really seeing how one of these 
spheres behaves and how much energy it really,

04:29.536 --> 04:38.927
from the wave, it really does dissipate? And one of 
the kids and clients took it up and looked at it and

04:40.493 --> 04:51.170
decided, yes, it was out of phase and did dissipate 
30 or 40 times the energy that it would if it were

04:40.493 --> 04:51.170
held rigidly. And then he dropped it. And then 
another kid took it up and really designed it

04:53.754 --> 04:56.117
through. And he now has his PhD and is working for 
the state building these things for the state of

04:56.218 --> 05:06.754
California, investigating the whole potential.

05:09.974 --> 05:13.558
So how do you exactly say when such a thing comes up? 
You see, I began to understand some years ago when

05:14.339 --> 05:31.016
we were working with

05:14.339 --> 05:31.016
deep sea moorings, where we made some deep sea 
moorings that survived out in the Pacific three or

05:14.339 --> 05:31.016
four years in more than 3,000 fathom of water. But 
one of the reasons these survived was that they did

05:31.657 --> 05:37.483
behave something in this fashion. And this 
allowed them in a storm to dodge the high waves.

05:41.931 --> 05:46.677
They moved around the high waves rather than over 
them. In a storm, the sea is a kind of stochastic

05:46.737 --> 05:55.609
topography of rapidly moving crests, of short 
crests. And if you now put a buoy out there that is

05:55.649 --> 06:07.285
hauled down strongly and doesn't weigh much, it 
threads its way between these crests in a

05:55.649 --> 06:07.285
complicated pattern. So it never gets hit by the 
high waves. It dodges them automatically. And

06:13.715 --> 06:30.217
it's

06:13.715 --> 06:30.217
clear this energy is coming from the waves, and 
that it's considerably more than just if the buoy

06:13.715 --> 06:30.217
were floating there and the waves were dragging 
against it. So all of this sort of fits together,

06:31.639 --> 06:37.407
and you finally decide, well, maybe this is a real 
way to go. So

06:38.365 --> 06:42.309
allow me to try it. So in other words, a whole 
combination of ideas, you would argue, in terms of

06:42.370 --> 06:53.482
science, experimenting with both small things 
and large things, drifts you into handling big

06:42.370 --> 06:53.482
problems. And that's poorly put. Let me try it this 
way. It's that you begin with dealing with

06:57.266 --> 07:07.478
specifics, and then all of a sudden I look up and 
you're... And you observe something that's

06:57.266 --> 07:07.478
irrelevant, perhaps, to the specifics you're 
looking at. And you store that away, and it's an

07:08.065 --> 07:11.129
experience. Okay, now, like the iceberg, for 
example. The other day, for instance, down on the

07:14.974 --> 07:27.732
beaches in Southern California, in Baja, 
California, and there's loads of sand dollars,

07:14.974 --> 07:27.732
and the sand is eroding by wind. They're on the 
beach, in the dry beach, and the sand is being

07:28.293 --> 07:32.959
driven very rapidly. And these sand dollars, all 
of them, are... slowly tilt up on little pinnacles

07:37.445 --> 07:44.778
of sand and take an attitude very much like the 
living organism does in the ocean. Well, now

07:46.741 --> 07:47.703
that's strange. You look at 100 or 200 of these 
things all standing up at the same angle, little

07:47.783 --> 07:56.077
pinnacle of sand behind them, holding them in that 
position. And this is much the position, although

07:56.097 --> 08:00.946
they're not without the pinnacle of sand, that you 
see them in the actual ocean. And you begin to

08:01.386 --> 08:02.929
wonder how much of this is mediated through just 
the hydrodynamic shape of the sand dollar you see

08:03.685 --> 08:26.419
all facing into the wind all with their top sides 
towards the wind all at about almost 60 degrees

08:03.685 --> 08:26.419
inclination all of them sitting there in like an 
array of these and sooner or later maybe i get a

08:03.685 --> 08:26.419
chance to maybe do some experiments on various 
sorts of creatures that live in a wave, high,

08:26.618 --> 08:34.027
strong wave current regime, like sand dollars, 
abysmal clams, and whatnot. Is there shape, a

08:34.588 --> 08:41.496
particular hydrodynamic shape that gives it 
desirable properties, allows it to bury itself,

08:34.588 --> 08:41.496
orient itself, or something? Or is this 
organically mediated through musculature, you

08:41.836 --> 08:45.160
see? Interesting, isn't it? Yeah. So I think all 
kinds of little observations fit together

08:49.079 --> 08:52.504
sometimes. And this is a case of a breakwater 
point, where loads of small observations lead you

08:52.624 --> 09:01.757
in some direction or another. I was also thinking 
about the concept of bringing down icebergs to

09:01.897 --> 09:07.686
furnish fresh water. How did that occur to me? 
Well, I want to know both how it occurred to you, and

09:13.073 --> 09:15.897
then I want your reaction. I remember how it 
occurred to me exactly. I was preparing, there was

09:19.673 --> 09:35.319
quite a bit of interest many years ago, and it keeps 
coming back periodically, of an underwater

09:19.673 --> 09:35.319
pipeline for Southern California to get its water 
from, God knows, Oregon, Washington, British

09:19.673 --> 09:35.319
Columbia, Alaska, whatnot. Stupid idea in my way 
of thinking. You don't know what's going on down

09:37.663 --> 09:39.606
there well enough. There are landslides, there 
are instabilities. There are all kinds of things,

09:42.811 --> 09:45.816
ships dropping their anchors and on and on. But 
nevertheless, you can make the following

09:47.888 --> 09:50.372
calculation. Let's say California needs 5 
million acre feet of water a year. OK, you can start

09:56.161 --> 09:58.205
to optimize this. You can make a pipeline. Now, the 
power to drive that water down that pipeline

10:00.709 --> 10:04.575
doesn't come free. Even though you build a dam up 
there somewhere, you could have made electricity

10:05.016 --> 10:10.785
out of it, you see, rather than driving water. So 
you think, well, I will optimize it. very rapidly

10:15.935 --> 10:26.488
realized that presently optimization, just from 
the standpoint of loss, of frictional loss, comes

10:15.935 --> 10:26.488
with bigger and bigger pipelines. And presently 
you have a pipeline that has all the 5 million acre

10:26.548 --> 10:31.754
feet in it. Well, now you might as well shorten it up 
more and just roll it into the ocean and tow it down.

10:40.925 --> 10:42.307
Now you begin to optimize that. It's a different 
concept. Well, I was preparing very early in my

10:46.883 --> 10:53.930
days in Scripps, was preparing a talk about the 
water problem. And one of the things I wanted to

10:54.210 --> 10:56.453
look at was the pipeline. And when I optimized this 
thing, I came out with something that was half a

10:58.054 --> 11:06.783
mile in diameter and five miles long or some such a 
thing. And it was optimum towing size. And I

11:09.146 --> 11:11.128
thought, Jesus, such things exist. They're the 
secondary tabular icebergs of the South

11:11.188 --> 11:14.511
Atlantic. Let's see how these go. What would be the 
milling rate? What would be the thing? And I made

11:19.550 --> 11:26.557
some calculations, and of course you come up with 
this interesting case that's a tome north from

11:19.550 --> 11:26.557
Antarctica. You really tome to the east like mad

11:26.577 --> 11:37.228
because of their rotation and Coriolis force, if 
you wish. And so these more recent studies by the

11:37.248 --> 11:41.612
Rand Corporation and so on on it... rather 
thorough studies, go into the Coriolis force

11:42.436 --> 11:54.551
effect

11:42.436 --> 11:54.551
in a rather erudite fashion. But of course, the 
simplest concept in the world gives you exactly

11:54.571 --> 11:58.435
the same answer. It just says you've got to get that 
iceberg going 1,000 miles an hour to get it, not in

11:58.736 --> 12:08.848
respect to the water, but in respect to the fixed 
reference plane, to get it over the equator. And

12:09.470 --> 12:11.193
you've got to tow it to the east to do this. You've 
got to get it going 1,000 miles an hour to the east.

12:15.079 --> 12:20.668
To

12:15.079 --> 12:20.668
the west, sorry. You've got to get it going 1,000 
miles an hour to the west to get over the equator.

12:29.763 --> 12:32.608
And you've got to tow essentially westerly. 
That's correct, isn't it? Good God, let's see. I

12:37.098 --> 12:38.879
always have to go through this thing. You've got to 
tow it to the east. Good heavens, yes. I was rotated

12:43.023 --> 12:44.544
there for a second. You have to tow it to the east. 
You have to go on 1,000 miles an hour to bring it

12:46.306 --> 12:51.490
essentially to the velocity of the Earth. Now,

12:53.352 --> 13:03.000
when I first remember reading about concepts of 
pulling icebergs to Southern California, Now, I

13:03.588 --> 13:10.576
remember scientists making fun, in fact, of sort 
of jiving this concept, if I may use that word. How

13:11.918 --> 13:21.329
do you feel as if when you introduced these ideas 
that long ago and it seems to be reaffirmed here in

13:11.918 --> 13:21.329
the present in terms of water shortages and 
ecological clashes? Well, I don't think we'll

13:21.649 --> 13:23.452
ever do it in California. You don't think you'll 
ever do it? No. Some other country I'll do it. It's

13:27.719 --> 13:28.780
too outlandish. The United States has lost a sense 
of adventure. It'll examine that and examine that

13:31.983 --> 13:35.126
until hell froze over. Worry about fogs and worry 
about freshwater influences and worry about this

13:35.847 --> 13:42.293
and that. Never tried. What do you attribute the 
loss of adventure to? Oh,

13:47.178 --> 13:57.388
I guess sort of a degree of senescence, I would 
guess. I don't know, you could erect a thousand

13:58.043 --> 14:02.990
theories on this, I think. We start out with a great 
deal of hybrid vigor in the United States. We have

14:06.835 --> 14:09.739
people of all sorts of social proclivities mixing 
together. And to some degree they don't mix

14:10.941 --> 14:12.643
anymore, you see. And I believe in heterosis, that 
is the strength of hybridization. And it only goes

14:22.076 --> 14:25.300
a generation or two, don't forget, you know. Well, 
that may be it. Or it may be we're in the same

14:27.182 --> 14:30.526
position as a person on Easy Street.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.111
Keep your finger on your number, as it were. Don't 
take any chances. There are the real concerns of

14:38.575 --> 14:41.158
the environmentalists, of course. You have to 
look at these things. They're real. You can't kill

14:45.043 --> 14:47.626
off things in vast numbers. But we've gone 
overboard on that. And it's a pendulum swinging

14:49.888 --> 14:52.711
problem. It may swing back again. But I think that 
we can't do this sort of thing anymore in the United

14:54.642 --> 15:00.529
States. We can't. We can't.

15:10.040 --> 15:16.147
Such a approach takes the agreement of a lot of 
people that you do need the water. You're going to

15:16.307 --> 15:17.288
do it. You're going to take some environmental 
losses. You try to minimize those. And it's too

15:23.752 --> 15:25.194
controversial. The congressman has to take the 
path of least irritation rather than the path of

15:26.636 --> 15:36.949
rationality. As long as I have you here on the 
environment, I have some questions to ask you

15:38.331 --> 15:42.617
later. May I ask them now? Nuclear power. carry on. 
You've just been through a referendum here in

15:49.388 --> 15:51.590
California. Do you think referendums on nuclear 
power are essentially good things? Referendums

15:56.176 --> 15:57.417
in which way? You mean against or for? Against or 
for. Do you think that the public ought to make

16:00.321 --> 16:04.085
these kinds of decisions concerning the 
environment? That's what I'm trying to find out.

16:06.087 --> 16:06.668
Well, of course.

16:10.212 --> 16:17.721
In the United States, we've fallen into the 
advocative position and of our decisions are made

16:18.798 --> 16:21.601
by a series of advocates.

16:25.664 --> 16:27.045
And this is kind of a long story. I don't want to get 
into it too deeply. But there's obviously a

16:29.428 --> 16:40.758
disparity between the scientific approach and 
the approach of advocacy. The lawyer picks only

16:41.779 --> 16:45.822
that evidence that supports his position. That's 
the way the advocate does.

16:51.046 --> 16:54.690
The scientist is forced into this system, then, to 
advise. And the applicative system says you're

16:56.652 --> 17:03.179
either with us or against us in no intermediate 
way. The scientist is unable to express his

17:03.239 --> 17:06.202
reservations. He's got to be gung-ho. He's got to 
be in that direction or against that direction,

17:08.905 --> 17:14.271
one or the other, no ifs, ands, or buts. And this is 
essentially an anathema to a scientist who really

17:18.603 --> 17:23.307
wants to evaluate things. He can't be all for or all 
against. This is why the budding scientist has

17:27.491 --> 17:34.278
such a hell of a problem with true, false, and 
questions. There aren't any true, false

17:34.298 --> 17:35.879
questions. They're answered true and false. 
They're always reservations one way or another.

17:39.162 --> 17:47.530
He either balances the reservations in which he 
probably fails, or he knows what the hell stupid

17:39.162 --> 17:47.530
answer the instructor really thinks is correct, 
huh? And that's the guy that makes it. But you see,

17:51.132 --> 18:01.864
once he gets out into the real world and has asked 
for advice, he really can't do that and preserve

17:51.132 --> 18:01.864
his scientific equilibrium. And so I think we get 
into this position of the scientist being

18:03.405 --> 18:13.737
essentially in a hopeless posture as far as 
advising on the public the public can't see the

18:14.290 --> 18:43.369
uncertainties and if he expresses the 
uncertainties then he's against it whatever well

18:14.290 --> 18:43.369
in the case of nuclear power

18:14.290 --> 18:43.369
it's a long argument there are risks to everything 
obviously

18:14.290 --> 18:43.369
I've

18:44.868 --> 18:55.900
I was out in the Pacific and saw the explosion of the 
Great Age bombs, many of them, 28 or something

18:44.868 --> 18:55.900
nuclear shots I've seen. I've seen a vast amount of 
radioactivity thrown into the coral atolls. The

19:02.027 --> 19:05.812
effect of it has been almost unobservable. The 
ocean has an immense resiliency and capacity.

19:13.893 --> 19:21.781
exactly what a major spill would be from a nuclear 
power plant, or a failure of containment of fuel. I

19:22.342 --> 19:24.504
really haven't looked into it. Clearly, you'd 
have some area that would be off limits. But it

19:31.311 --> 19:33.514
can't be a disaster, you see. It can't be a vast 
disaster.

19:40.461 --> 19:41.622
But of course, you see, Then again, we're up 
against the other problem of the utilities always

19:42.023 --> 19:51.781
plan for growth of existing areas. So we have this 
self-fulfilling forecast in which You want the

19:57.059 --> 20:06.748
power plant to supply power for the city of Los 
Angeles because the city of Los Angeles is going to

19:57.059 --> 20:06.748
grow, and then that's the only place it can grow 
because that's the only place there's power, and

19:57.059 --> 20:06.748
so on. You know, the idiotic situation we're in. I 
would like to see power services put in places

20:09.731 --> 20:12.694
where there aren't anybody. Then they might live 
there instead of, well, if they want to all live in

20:13.074 --> 20:18.039
Los Angeles, that's fine with me. It leaves other 
places a little freer. But are... The number of

20:24.413 --> 20:31.622
forces that tend to concentrate us into these 
areas are insensate forces. There are many of

20:31.662 --> 20:32.924
them. One is the preparation for utilities. 
That's one. The other is, of course, loan and

20:36.629 --> 20:41.355
insurance policy and things of this nature. You 
can't go out in the back country and build a house.

20:43.398 --> 20:45.801
You can't get a loan on it, and you can't get it. You 
don't understand.

20:49.325 --> 20:49.446
Yeah. So... We're forced then to put these nuclear 
power plants, if we're going to put them, very

20:51.667 --> 20:58.841
close to highly utilized coastlines.

21:02.007 --> 21:06.616
And intervening into a system that's already has 
very dense use. Under those circumstances, that

21:08.921 --> 21:11.987
may be undesirable. if we put one if this were a free 
world really planning the accommodation of man

21:14.110 --> 21:39.038
and this planet together why one would put one down 
in baja california somewhere

21:14.110 --> 21:39.038
i both admire that and resent that i don't want any 
power plants in baja california or any place in the

21:14.110 --> 21:39.038
wilderness i don't think i know that makes sense 
ecologically what has to be done

21:41.313 --> 21:54.856
Well, as long as I have you on resilience of ocean, I 
read in Newsweek magazine last night, this is like

21:41.313 --> 21:54.856
the fourth or fifth time I've read that, where 
Jacques Cousteau, a naturalist, says in 30 years

21:41.313 --> 21:54.856
the ocean would be dead. Do you resent that as a 
scientist?

22:01.106 --> 22:04.492
Let's keep that off the record. Okay. I don't want 
to be sued.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.588
until I get my defense fund together. All right. 
I'll rephrase the question another way, then, I

22:12.851 --> 22:21.223
may, without involving any names. I assume you 
believe the ocean is amazingly resilient in terms

22:21.764 --> 22:26.391
of... Resilient, yes. Resilient, I'm sorry, 
resilient in terms of recovery. Do you think that

22:32.860 --> 22:38.168
the ocean should be exploited more, move into 
things like mariculture,

22:39.633 --> 22:41.436
Well, let's stop at the first statement. The 
exploitation of traps has the wrong connotation.

22:45.641 --> 22:52.611
It certainly should be utilized more, and with 
good sense, rationality, and dignity. I think it

22:53.152 --> 22:57.218
can be a great deal more. We know a great deal more 
about it than we did 30 years ago. I've published

23:00.863 --> 23:07.632
rather extensively on exactly the same business, 
including Cousteau, if you wish. And it's right

23:08.708 --> 23:09.709
here.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.236
You probably have that. Yeah. And you don't have a 
match, do you? No.

23:29.113 --> 23:33.858
You may, for my answer about Christou, you can read 
that into the record right there. Okay. I'll find a

23:35.160 --> 23:36.201
match.

23:47.909 --> 23:53.994
In fact, I had looked at that, and that was one of the 
things that interested me last night vis-a-vis

23:47.909 --> 23:53.994
this. Well,

23:54.235 --> 24:10.489
I assume you believe this sort of adverse 
publicity towards utilization of the ocean

23:54.235 --> 24:10.489
affects

23:54.235 --> 24:10.489
wrongly the process of oceanographers?

24:12.971 --> 24:14.193
Affects what? That it has a negative... reaction 
upon oceanographers? This kind of public opinion

24:18.272 --> 24:21.876
that these sorts of things stir up affects your 
work? Well, sure, of course. I

24:22.897 --> 24:39.415
don't really quite know how to answer that 
question, but let me say that I myself and a great

24:22.897 --> 24:39.415
number of other oceanographers have had a great 
deal of their lives trying to solve problems that

24:39.985 --> 24:50.479
society has in some way or another enunciated, 
that it said that they were important problems.

24:53.804 --> 24:57.489
In several of these cases, we've solved these 
problems and solved them exquisitely. I mean,

24:59.151 --> 25:02.736
much better than one would have expected they 
could have been solved. The understanding of the

25:03.340 --> 25:12.413
pelagic fissures versus the California current, 
for instance, I think is understood much better

25:03.340 --> 25:12.413
than anybody 20 years ago who expected was ever 
obtainable. We understand really something

25:13.154 --> 25:22.828
about the total nature of the population, how it 
fluctuates, what the interrelationships are,

25:13.154 --> 25:22.828
and what it's been like for 2,000 years. We know. I 
think we really understand that.

25:28.937 --> 25:29.618
And yet... Public opinion is set up at a number of 
thoughtless people who keep saying, don't let the

25:31.184 --> 25:47.292
anchovy go as the sardine did, overfishing, on and 
on, and not allow the proper utilization of this

25:31.184 --> 25:47.292
environment. Now, what you tend to leave behind 
you here is the debris of dedicated scientists who

25:54.708 --> 25:58.414
are trying to serve society. There's not much to 
ask of society to be able to serve it with the best of

25:58.434 --> 26:03.021
your intelligence. Society should be set up in 
such a way that you can. I think the desalination

26:06.767 --> 26:19.888
problem, the fisheries problems have left behind 
them in their wake a great deal of disillusioned

26:06.767 --> 26:19.888
people who have tried to serve society, advise it, 
and then find Not that society doesn't act the way

26:21.353 --> 26:28.823
they thought it should act, but that it doesn't 
even consider the findings in the decisions. It

26:29.704 --> 26:30.685
doesn't even consider them. That's the , isn't it? 
That's the ultimate coup d'etat.

26:39.877 --> 26:41.900
And so now you find them doing their own thing. Why 
the hell should they try to serve society? I mean,

26:46.306 --> 26:47.427
science is interesting. It's a career. Why not 
just do it? Do the things you want to do. Don't try to

26:51.492 --> 26:53.274
serve it. It doesn't pay attention to you. See, 
it's not a question that you say, well, there's

26:56.338 --> 27:15.621
600,000 tons of anchovies that you ought to be able 
to take out here, maybe a million tons, and enrich

26:56.338 --> 27:15.621
California

26:56.338 --> 27:15.621
to a considerable extent, learn a great deal more 
about the utilization of this part of the food web,

26:56.338 --> 27:15.621
and so forth, that you should do this. The fact that 
society doesn't do that and has archaic

27:21.192 --> 27:29.266
legislation that doesn't allow it to do it, and an 
engraved public opinion that will not allow it to

27:21.192 --> 27:29.266
do it. That's not the question that they didn't do 
it, but that they don't even consider the

27:31.811 --> 27:34.996
findings. That the people who act on these are 
acting only on the basis of the advocates of the

27:45.205 --> 27:52.475
advocates who argue, the public advocates that 
argue on one side and don't even consider the

27:45.205 --> 27:52.475
evidence. So you find yourself in the position of 
having devoted quite a bit of your life to really

27:53.757 --> 28:12.462
looking into attempting to advise society in 
these practical utilizations of the ocean and

27:53.757 --> 28:12.462
then finding that, not that your findings are not 
acted on, but rather that your findings are not

27:53.757 --> 28:12.462
even considered. in the evidence, in the 
decisions. It's quite a disappointment.
