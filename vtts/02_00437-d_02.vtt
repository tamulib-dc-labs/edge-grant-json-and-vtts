WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:03.824
Let me get through this introduction, then I think 
we ought to quit. It's 5.50. Sorry. That's why I

00:06.267 --> 00:07.849
went over. And if we get to drag this out now, we're 
talking, aren't we? We'll just edit all of this

00:15.200 --> 00:16.462
out. At

00:17.063 --> 00:21.409
that time, I went over there. The Air Force, the 
United States Air Force commander at Saigon was

00:21.449 --> 00:27.658
called a second air division. At the time I was 
going over there, it was changed to 7th Air Force. A

00:33.493 --> 00:36.598
little bit before I went over there, it might have 
been changed to 7th Air Force. The 13th Air Force

00:36.618 --> 00:48.335
was in the Philippines, and they command 
administrative-wise, support-wise, 13th Air

00:36.618 --> 00:48.335
Force in the Philippines. Now, we're going to get 
into complex things, so bear with me. They owned

00:53.282 --> 00:57.308
the fighter units based in Thailand. Now, I'm not 
talking about the fighter units in South Vietnam.

01:02.205 --> 01:04.988
That was run by the 2nd Air Division and 7th Air 
Force. But the 13th Air Force owned and supported

01:06.670 --> 01:14.880
these units in Thailand. My job was to be in Udorn,

01:14.900 --> 01:23.170
the Royal Thai Air Force Base in Udorn, Thailand. 
U-D-O-R-N. We were going to set up a headquarters

01:25.992 --> 01:48.057
at the direction of the chief of staff of the Air 
Force to a great extent for political and

01:25.992 --> 01:48.057
Air Force military

01:25.992 --> 01:48.057
reasons.

01:51.701 --> 01:52.422
The ranking United States. So what we're doing 
then, there was no base before you went. Oh yeah,

01:57.798 --> 01:59.680
these are Thai Air Force. Thailand, there was no 
Americans at the base before you went. Oh yeah,

02:02.663 --> 02:04.906
there was an American unit, a fighter unit. That 
had been actually a recon unit there. But the

02:08.150 --> 02:13.997
several other Thailand Air Force bases all 
belonged to the Royal Thai Air Force. We had

02:14.097 --> 02:18.843
fighter units based there that were doing the 
bombing against North Vietnam. And supported by

02:20.325 --> 02:23.168
tankers for air refueling from bases in the 
Philippines, and Iwo

02:23.502 --> 02:29.228
Jima. Not Iwo Jima. Okinawa. Okinawa. Then we 
built, while I was over there, that's one of the

02:34.494 --> 02:51.293
things that supervised, we built a huge B-52 and 
tanker base in southern Thailand and called it, oh

02:34.494 --> 02:51.293
gee, the name. But anyway. I'll think of it. You're 
still telling me now why you went over there. Okay.

02:59.101 --> 03:02.204
These forces were all under 13th Air Force. Now, 
the Thailand Command directing the war under

03:02.224 --> 03:15.879
General Westmoreland was called United States 
Command South Vietnam. There was a United States

03:15.899 --> 03:21.285
Command MacThai, United States Military Command 
Thailand, U.S. McTighe, in Bangkok, and the Army

03:21.485 --> 03:34.866
got this job as a slot, commanded by an Army, United 
States Army Major General. They had, the United

03:36.890 --> 03:47.847
States Army, had some communications and 
logistics type forces at Karat Air Force Base. for

03:48.383 --> 03:49.264
munitions. That's all the army forces that were in 
Thailand. Whereas the United States Air Force had

03:53.988 --> 04:18.070
fighter units, F-4s and F-105s at Karat, Ubon, 
Udorn, and eventually at Nakhon Pathom, had a

03:53.988 --> 04:18.070
reconnaissance unit at Udorn, and so-called 
beret forces, special forces, at Nakhon Phanom. A

04:22.261 --> 04:26.745
hundred times more units and forces than the 
United States Army. Yet, the command slot in

04:27.246 --> 04:33.232
Thailand was given to the United States Army. Any 
time any politicians or anybody came to Thailand,

04:33.673 --> 04:46.386
actually the Army component commander with his 
army hat on would go down and beat them. you know,

04:46.754 --> 04:48.716
this jealousy. Sure. Inter-service rivalry. 
Inter-service rivalry that was just

04:51.119 --> 04:57.347
unacceptable as far as the Air Force was 
concerned. So... Too much rivalry as far as the Air

04:57.367 --> 05:03.814
Force... Well, I mean, it was unacceptable. The 
fact that this man was arming... It was

05:06.738 --> 05:10.763
disproportionate command and 
responsibility-wise on the spot. The general

05:13.266 --> 05:16.069
commanding McIntyre forces was... Of course, he 
assumed that he'd had response below the other

05:17.416 --> 05:25.826
forces, too, and acted as though he'd command 
them, and that irritated him. So there's a lot of

05:25.846 --> 05:29.950
friction between the Army general and the Air 
Force general in Thailand. There was no Air Force

05:31.392 --> 05:33.475
general in Thailand. No, not until I got there. 
That's what I'm explaining. That's the reason the

05:37.699 --> 05:45.128
position was set up by General McConnell, Chief of 
Staff, and the ambassador of Thailand fully

05:45.682 --> 05:48.245
endorsed this. And so did the ambassador at Laos, 
Ambassador Graham Martin

05:48.265 --> 06:14.997
in Thailand,

05:48.265 --> 06:14.997
Ambassador I've already given you his name 
before. Anyway, they set up and they sent me, and

06:15.432 --> 06:34.129
matter of fact, I was personally briefed by 
General McConnell, the Chief of Staff of the Air

06:15.432 --> 06:34.129
Force, in his office before I went as to really what 
my job was to be in very general terms.

06:34.269 --> 06:43.718
Essentially, I was to represent the Air Force in 
Thailand, and I ranked. the Army general in charge

06:45.622 --> 06:51.047
of MACTI by about a year. And, you know, in services 
rank has its privileges and also there's a special

06:52.969 --> 07:09.465
regulation in the armed forces where a

06:52.969 --> 07:09.465
commander junior to a subordinate cannot command 
him.

07:12.968 --> 07:14.970
Word to this effect. I was sent over as the, my job, 
my title was to be Deputy Commander 7th Air Force

07:15.271 --> 07:25.166
Headquarters. I had five bosses.

07:29.753 --> 07:40.849
The Commander 7th Air Force in Saigon was my boss 
from the standpoint of tactical coordination,

07:29.753 --> 07:40.849
where he expected me on the spot for all the fighter 
forces, and if you will, air defense also. We had

07:41.510 --> 07:43.573
radar sites manned. by Air Force people with the 
Thai people working with Thailand, but from a

07:44.566 --> 08:04.009
strictly Air Force standpoint, the United States 
Air Force Department, the Command 7th Air Force,

07:44.566 --> 08:04.009
and wrote his OER on me, Officer Fechner's report 
on my performance, in support of coordinating on a

07:44.566 --> 08:04.009
tactical effort. He wrote the FRAG orders. Okay, 
so he was your first boss. That's my first boss. was

08:09.288 --> 08:18.924
the commander of 13th Air Force of the Philippines 
because he owned and logistically supported all

08:09.288 --> 08:18.924
of this Thailand operation of the United States 
Air Force. And I was on the spot commander in

08:18.944 --> 08:29.300
implementing all of that responsibility and, you 
know, inspection, supervision, and saying that

08:18.944 --> 08:29.300
it was done and all. My

08:30.162 --> 08:37.253
united, my joint commander, was General 
Stilwell, the Commander Bactai, United States

08:38.060 --> 08:45.876
Commander, Military Air Command, Thailand. And 
the Joint Command, Chain of Command, he was to be my

08:47.279 --> 08:54.313
commander, but I ranked him. The minute he learned 
about me coming over there, even before I left the

08:55.458 --> 09:05.911
United States, he sent a wire through Army 
Channel, and it hit Washington, D.C., and he

08:55.458 --> 09:05.911
wanted to know why this was being done. General 
McConnell told me about this before he even left,

09:06.131 --> 09:09.315
and I sort of managed it. And he, you know, 
indicated to me the problem I was going to have, but

09:09.335 --> 09:14.221
I think you're capable of handling it. I want the 
United States Air Force represented in Thailand,

09:14.241 --> 09:20.048
and you're the man I'm sending over there to do it. 
When people come over there and land in Bangkok, no

09:21.310 --> 09:27.518
matter where they always land, you beat them. Yes, 
sir. I knew what he was getting at. I'd have been

09:30.782 --> 09:31.623
trained. Now, I've talked about three bosses. 
Now, it might surprise you to say- What did the Army

09:37.190 --> 09:41.415
say, though, when they received this telegram? 
They couldn't do anything about it. They couldn't

09:44.899 --> 09:46.421
do anything about it. This was a United States Air 
Force administrative action. Okay, so you're

09:52.259 --> 09:53.541
fourth boss. Fourth boss. Right. My fourth and 
fifth bosses were ambassadors. And they acted

09:59.349 --> 10:02.593
like it. Grant Martin, and I got along with both of 
them beautifully, but I must admit when I talked to

10:02.653 --> 10:16.512
some of my military bosses, I got my head beat in and 
it was a problem. But before we get to Graham

10:16.998 --> 10:22.764
Martin, we're going to talk about him. So you have 
five bosses, and your job, regardless of your

10:22.784 --> 10:39.381
title here, which is somewhat confusing, your job 
was that you were the senior Air Force officer in

10:22.784 --> 10:39.381
Thailand. On the spot in Thailand. Representing 
the Air Force. In other words, you were the senior

10:44.723 --> 10:50.551
Air Force commander in Thailand. I was a senior 
United States military commander in Thailand.

10:56.579 --> 10:57.400
Yeah, right. Because you outranked

10:57.420 --> 11:02.166
your so-called boss. And immediately, of course, 
this gave the McTighe commander, an Army general,

11:02.187 --> 11:12.100
room to ask for his third star. And what was his 
name? General Stilwell. He and I got along all

11:16.405 --> 11:17.507
right. He and I knew what was going on. And we, you 
know, sometimes just have to accept the situation

11:19.590 --> 11:23.756
and we got along all right. So you had no problems 
with him really? Oh yeah, we had problems. At times

11:27.021 --> 11:31.768
we even had a few words, but we glossed over them and 
we got along all right. I have a great respect for

11:31.788 --> 11:35.433
him and I think he had great respect for me. I hope. 
But Graham Martin was the ambassador of Thailand

11:37.957 --> 11:43.705
was in effect He sort of acted as a boss in a way, 
politically and diplomatically, and also across

11:44.545 --> 11:54.294
the border was Ambassador Bill Sullivan. Okay, 
Bill Sullivan. Bill Sullivan was Ambassador to

11:55.595 --> 11:57.417
Laos. Young, very ambitious, and very capable 
ambassador. And I found out that even he and Graham

12:02.722 --> 12:08.427
Martin, you know, had their differences. In a 
diplomatic world, just like in a military world,

12:08.527 --> 12:11.970
you know, you have people jealous of their 
prerogatives and so forth. Can you imagine my

12:15.858 --> 12:17.341
position? Five bosses. I am sure that, looking 
over my records, based on the best jobs I had, that

12:20.326 --> 12:29.824
that's the reason General McConnell A terrific 
guy, by the way, Chief of Staff. That's the reason

12:32.814 --> 12:34.377
he gave me that job. And to make a long story short, 
when I left he rewarded me for the job I did and gave

12:34.397 --> 12:45.155
me commander of a technical air force, the 12th Air 
Force. But this was an interesting tour and I would

12:45.175 --> 12:53.348
suggest what we do now is sort of break it down.

13:03.554 --> 13:06.998
OK. You talked about your five boss. Oh, I should 
say that this is the 23rd of January, 1981. And this

13:10.863 --> 13:13.406
is our third day of interview. Now, you talked 
yesterday afternoon about your five bosses. I'd

13:19.013 --> 13:28.445
like to know about your command at Udorn and how 
many airplanes we have there. What was the

13:28.525 --> 13:32.650
mission, the function of the Air Force in 
Thailand?

13:40.915 --> 14:07.007
I guess the best way to describe it is that I have to 
start with the commander of the entire Southeast

13:40.915 --> 14:07.007
Asian war at that time, General Westmoreland, 
commander of the entire American forces, Army,

13:40.915 --> 14:07.007
Navy, and Air Force in the area, reporting 
straight back to the front chiefs of staff. But

14:07.027 --> 14:09.690
under him, of course, you had the Air Force 
component, the 7th Air Force, which did the air

14:10.193 --> 14:30.675
action for

14:10.193 --> 14:30.675
the Southeast Asian operation, but I hasten to 
add, did not control entirely naval air, which is a

14:10.193 --> 14:30.675
point that I think we'll get into later on. But we 
attempted many times to get control of naval air,

14:31.196 --> 14:38.563
particularly under General Momar when I was over 
there. But under the 7th Air Force, We had air

14:40.518 --> 14:45.306
forces in South Vietnam, of course. But for the 
major efforts in striking North Vietnam, in

14:46.608 --> 15:08.382
bombing, if you will, all done by fighters, these 
forces were based at several bases in Thailand and

14:46.608 --> 15:08.382
were, to use the vernacular of the military, frag, 
fragmentation orders, written, ordering them on

14:46.608 --> 15:08.382
certain flights the following day. All of this was 
fragged from 7th Air Force. Now the logistical

15:12.596 --> 15:29.580
support for all these forces in Thailand, 
fighters and bombers, fighters and tankers, and

15:12.596 --> 15:29.580
eventually B-52s, were

15:12.596 --> 15:29.580
from the 13th Air Force based in the Philippines. 
Well, Clark Air Force Base. It's just the

15:31.863 --> 15:35.668
peculiarities of organization in the Southeast 
Asian area. Logistical support came from 13th Air

15:37.623 --> 15:43.151
Force responsibility. Operational control and 
fighting the war actually from 7th Air Force in

15:43.171 --> 15:51.002
Saigon. 7th Air Force being a four-star general, 
General Mollmeyer at the time. 13th Air Force

15:55.789 --> 16:02.659
being Lieutenant General Jim Wilson at the time. 
How do you spell Mollmeyer? M-O-M-M-Y-E-R.

16:07.576 --> 16:09.318
classmate of mine. Terrific, terrific man.

16:14.443 --> 16:18.067
Very controversial, by the way, too, but 
terrific.

16:21.371 --> 16:36.267
The fighter forces based at the several bases in 
Thailand, Ubon, Udorn, Korat, Takli, and minor

16:21.371 --> 16:36.267
forces at the Khan Phanom, if you will,

16:41.748 --> 16:52.258
the reconnaissance forces based at Boudourne, 
and the huge tankers and eventually B-52s based at

16:41.748 --> 16:52.258
the huge base we built during the time I was over 
there. And I've got to get the name of this base for

16:52.899 --> 16:55.561
you. I'll probably think of it before the 
discussion is over.

17:02.168 --> 17:10.776
These actions were controlled primarily by the 
7th Air Force, but I also haste to add, this gets

17:02.168 --> 17:10.776
complicated,

17:11.397 --> 17:40.138
control or both operational and support supply 
came over the both the tankers and the b-52s came

17:11.397 --> 17:40.138
down eventually from sac headquarters through 
his various sub commands and chain of command

17:11.397 --> 17:40.138
through okinawa to these forces based in thailand 
is SAC controlled forces. And here again, SAC

17:46.257 --> 18:04.855
would never give up complete control of these 
forces to even the 7th Air Force commander, much

17:46.257 --> 18:04.855
less the 13th Air Force, and much less the unified 
commander, General Westmoreland of Southeast

17:46.257 --> 18:04.855
Asia. SAC retained control of these forces. He 
couldn't? Westmoreland couldn't get that

18:07.677 --> 18:10.480
control away? Westmoreland requested, 
Westmoreland always requested this support, but

18:11.371 --> 18:17.139
of course he got it from SAC. You remember, you've 
read about the huge bombings, the carpet bombing

18:18.542 --> 18:25.191
types, the B-52s. Right. General Westmoreland, 
as the unified commander for all armed forces in

18:27.054 --> 18:39.252
the United States and Southeast Asia, he 
requested these types of strikes in

18:27.054 --> 18:39.252
coordination, really, with SAC planners. But he 
didn't order them. But he didn't. Well, let's say

18:41.723 --> 18:48.353
he requested them and Sack fulfilled them. These, 
of course, were coordinated really through

18:48.633 --> 19:07.703
Seventh Air Force because the number one air 
component, the number one air commander, and this

18:48.633 --> 19:07.703
was basic concepts of Air Force doctrine, and even 
Sack admitted this, that there had to be a single

18:48.633 --> 19:07.703
air commander in any theater, and that was 
essentially General Volmeyer. But let's say

19:13.704 --> 19:28.004
sometimes this was kind of blinked at at SAC, 
because after all, you know, we had SAC, and give

19:13.704 --> 19:28.004
them credit, they had to retain control of their 
forces in case of, let's say, a big breakout

19:13.704 --> 19:28.004
someplace else. And remember, these B-52s were 
being utilized over there, also had a nuclear

19:28.024 --> 19:33.291
capability. So they had to be, he had to be free to be 
able to pull his forces out at any time. He

19:38.969 --> 19:50.686
recognized the requirements of Southeast 
Station Bar and General Westmoreland's

19:38.969 --> 19:50.686
requirements, and the Air Force Component 
Commander, General Mobar, 7th Air Force. He

19:50.706 --> 19:52.989
recognized their requirements. But it was a 
matter of very, sometimes very complicated

19:53.009 --> 20:00.039
coordination, but it got done. And the strikes, 
bomber strikes in North Vietnam, were effective.

20:09.817 --> 20:10.758
I say effective.

20:14.182 --> 20:15.323
But we'll get to that. OK. It was a tough task. Now, 
that's the way we operated. Now, my job

20:22.651 --> 20:31.420
specifically in Thailand was, as I described to 
think earlier, was the on-the-spot Air Force

20:22.651 --> 20:31.420
commander. It was far, far more politically than 
it was tactically. Sounds like it. Really,

20:39.719 --> 20:52.071
support-wise, because support, coordination, 
and planning went directly from 13th Air Force

20:39.719 --> 20:52.071
Headquarters, really to the bases. I, if you will, 
was an explorer, was an on-the-spot implementer,

20:52.091 --> 21:04.984
was an on-the-spot supervisor, and I put out the 
fires if I had a problem. I was on the spot in

21:05.403 --> 21:07.325
Thailand. I got the information. I called General 
Wilson on the telephone and said, we've got to do

21:08.566 --> 21:12.270
this and do that. I was a... You kept the Air Force 
running smoothly in Thailand. I coordinated

21:19.778 --> 21:21.640
problems. And coordinating problems between 
five bosses is a difficult problem, to say the

21:21.660 --> 21:27.206
least. As a matter of fact, you might mention at 
this time, as typical of my job, It was a tough job. I

21:35.859 --> 21:42.407
wrote a letter to General McConnell after I'd been 
over there about two or three months. I wrote a

21:42.427 --> 21:46.633
letter to him because he said, sometime now, if 
you're over there, let me know. Write me and let me

21:46.673 --> 21:49.797
know how you're doing and what the problems are. So 
I wrote him a letter. It took two or three days, but I

21:51.780 --> 21:54.123
wrote it carefully. But one of my comments in the 
letter was that you told me to use my head. I assure

22:01.242 --> 22:05.388
you I have used my head, and I've got a lot of knots on 
it. Fortunately, I still have it on my shoulders.

22:08.713 --> 22:11.457
Then I explained why, coordination between five 
bosses. And I knew he'd get kicked out of it. As a

22:14.121 --> 22:27.621
matter of fact, I found out later on, Butch, his 
deputy chief of staff, I mean his vice chief of

22:14.121 --> 22:27.621
staff at the Air Force, a SAC man, Butch, I think the 
name made it wrong. He visited over there and told

22:28.546 --> 22:34.193
me, he said, Charlie, you know the letter you wrote 
to General McConnell? I said, yeah. He said, one

22:34.573 --> 22:42.483
day, one morning at staff meeting, he brought that 
letter to the staff meeting of his entire staff and

22:34.573 --> 22:42.483
read that part about your head. And he said, I'm 
telling you, it cracked up the entire staff. He

22:46.227 --> 22:52.575
said, they've never earned anything for money in 
their life because they knew exactly, they knew

22:46.227 --> 22:52.575
exactly what I was talking about. They knew 
General Jim Wilson, who was called the alligator.

22:56.620 --> 22:57.861
They knew General Momar. grim, tough, so-and-so. 
They knew General Stilwell, died in the World Army

23:01.522 --> 23:12.276
guy, and definitely for the Army, and right in the 
middle of this problem of the controversy between

23:01.522 --> 23:12.276
Army and Air Force. They knew Graham Martin, the 
ambassador, and they knew little Bill Sullivan,

23:12.296 --> 23:22.069
the very aggressive little ambassador of Laos. 
They knew exactly what my problem was. So General

23:25.273 --> 23:27.696
McConnell got quite a kick out of it. But that 
exemplifies and explains as an example of really

23:28.402 --> 23:34.188
what my job was. I coordinated. Besides the 
coordination, which is always a headache, I would

23:35.489 --> 23:55.911
imagine, were there other problems that you had to 
deal with, let's say, as far as keeping equipment

23:35.489 --> 23:55.911
maintained or as far as personnel, maybe drugs or I 
don't know, anything to do, any problems that you

23:35.489 --> 23:55.911
had as far as maintenance and personnel and just 
living in Thailand and keeping the Thais and the

23:56.330 --> 24:03.698
American airmen good relations, any of those 
things? Oh yeah, there's numerous. There were

24:05.080 --> 24:08.323
numerous problems and they varied from day to day. 
I might add also, in a way you might say I had a sixth

24:08.343 --> 24:18.815
boss, but I never really concerned myself too much 
about it, but this was the chief of staff of the Thai

24:08.343 --> 24:18.815
Air Forces. See all these were Thai, T-H-A-I, 
Thailand. All these were Thai bases. We never took

24:24.393 --> 24:25.474
them over. We just used them. And thank goodness we 
had that concrete in Thailand. Otherwise, we'd

24:30.618 --> 24:33.801
never been able to get fighters up to bomb North 
Vietnam.

24:38.665 --> 24:41.647
I can't remember any great problem about 
shortages. We violated many, many Air Force

24:43.169 --> 24:49.894
regulations strictly about building 
budgets-wise and dollars. Goodness, the way we

24:49.994 --> 24:52.216
had to build bases over there. We had to do it. I gave 
General Wilson credit. Matter of fact, I take my

24:56.254 --> 24:58.538
hat off to him. He didn't let written regulations 
stop him. If we needed this base and we needed

25:01.622 --> 25:05.127
something on it, he said build it. For example? 
What type of rules and regulations? Well, you have

25:10.135 --> 25:15.983
to get, let's say, certain approval of a certain 
amount of money for a certain project normally in

25:16.402 --> 25:20.227
the United States before you can do anything? And 
do you have the budget money? Were you within the

25:22.150 --> 25:23.792
budget to do it? And a commander of an air force had 
to sign off on a particular thing before even the

25:23.872 --> 25:31.262
staff could proceed, give the base authority to do 
it. Of course, we're in a war. Jim didn't worry

25:33.646 --> 25:35.628
about these things. General Wilson didn't worry 
about it. I didn't worry about it. But sometimes

25:38.052 --> 25:45.021
when the staff or inspectors from Pentagon come 
down through there, well, you know, they'd come to

25:38.052 --> 25:45.021
the surface and there'd be problems. You had to... 
talk about. Morale problems amongst the THUD

25:48.406 --> 25:56.115
drivers, if you will, the F-105 aircraft. You 
know, we were losing pilots. Never before, never

25:59.739 --> 26:16.277
before has air attacks been made in such dense, 
modern surface-to-air missile defenses as was

25:59.739 --> 26:16.277
done by Seventh Air Force fighters. against North 
Vietnam. These were Soviet-installed,

26:18.648 --> 26:27.339
Soviet-made, Soviet-installed SAMs, and they 
were effective. And we lost pilots. We lost

26:30.323 --> 26:31.926
aircraft to those things. We devised tactics to 
get around it. It's just typical of any other

26:35.110 --> 26:36.832
thing. When you come up against advanced 
technology, you devise a tactic. Or more

26:41.058 --> 26:42.720
technology, How many pilots do you remember? Do 
you remember how many you lost, and what type were

26:45.138 --> 26:48.382
the tactics? How did you get around the SAMs? How 
successful were your tactics? We were successful

26:52.769 --> 26:54.351
in getting around them. One of General Momar's 
problems as an Air Force commander was, and I take

26:54.551 --> 27:10.294
my hat off to him, should I concentrate on still 
tending my attacking forces against the target,

26:54.551 --> 27:10.294
namely, let's say, an air base where fighters are, 
a power plant. Should I, right in the middle of a

27:14.247 --> 27:20.635
missile defense in Hanoi, should I continue to do 
that? Or since I'm losing aircraft at almost an

27:21.296 --> 27:36.475
unacceptable rate, should I maybe divert some 
action against these missile defenses first and

27:21.296 --> 27:36.475
then hit my targets? Well, he stuck to his job. He 
continued to hit the targets and bomb them,

27:40.919 --> 27:45.327
because we knew we could always get through any 
defenses. But remember, this was the first time we

27:45.467 --> 27:50.577
came up against modern surface-to-air missiles. 
So we had to devise tactics, and we devised— First,

27:51.438 --> 27:57.089
how many did you lose? What at times, let's say, 
Karat would come back with a force of maybe 25

27:57.169 --> 28:05.003
F-105s. of their base, 24 F-105 from their base, 
took off and attacked and come back and five

28:05.641 --> 28:13.429
aircraft and five pilots would be missing that 
morning. No kidding. You could lose 25% or 20% in

28:14.610 --> 28:17.973
just one raid? Yep. That afternoon, let's say 
maybe we lose three more at one base. This affected

28:24.599 --> 28:26.621
pilot more. No kidding.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.647
The F-105s took the brunt. Those aircraft When 
you'd see them take off with as much as 16 bombs

28:35.341 --> 28:56.514
hanging underneath the fighter,

28:35.341 --> 28:56.514
saying that they could go Mach 1, in other words, at 
the speed of sound, carrying these bombs, they did

28:35.341 --> 28:56.514
well to climb to 20,000 feet with that bomb load on 
them. Sure. The escorting F-4s had to throttle

28:58.016 --> 29:01.602
back to stay with them. not escorting, but I mean 
flying with them because they had better

29:03.218 --> 29:09.026
performance.

29:09.567 --> 29:15.476
They had to be refueled for just that flight up to 
North Vietnam. By tankers, absolutely. They

29:16.878 --> 29:20.002
couldn't make it because they carried so many 
bombs. But it was this type of thing. But to get

29:22.526 --> 29:24.709
around these SAMs was another thing. Okay, now 
let's talk about that. Well, we devised, what's

29:26.271 --> 29:29.256
the word we used? I'll have to fill this in for you. 
But it was a flight and special-designed

29:32.547 --> 29:53.307
F-105s, two-seater F-105s, where you had an 
operator in the back looking at instrumentation

29:32.547 --> 29:53.307
that had been installed in the aircraft to pick up 
the launching of a SAM and actually have a strobe to

29:32.547 --> 29:53.307
point where it was coming from. And then having 
found out where it was coming from, then the

29:53.927 --> 30:02.115
aircraft would launch a special mission, a 
special missile air-to-ground missile called

30:02.652 --> 30:08.040
a—here it is. I can't remember. I have to get the 
name of that. You've got me going here. I'll fill in

30:13.088 --> 30:14.470
as we get back. And he had launched this missile, 
air-to-ground missile, against the SAM site. In

30:23.724 --> 30:27.670
other words, we suppress the SAMs. At the same 
time, the bombers are coming over to drop their

30:28.191 --> 30:31.596
bombs. Okay, so I'm a little lost here. How did you 
know the Sands were there? They'd shoot at you.

30:39.017 --> 30:49.790
Okay, but I mean, what you do is sort of, this is not 
very military language, but what you do is sort of

30:39.017 --> 30:49.790
send a decoy over? No, our bombers, gradually, as 
our bombers were bombing Hanoi, they had to do

30:49.850 --> 31:01.583
something in Hanoi to defend. Their MiGs couldn't 
defend against it. Therefore, the Soviets gave

31:04.472 --> 31:10.222
them these missiles, advanced technology. We 
didn't know this at first. Well, gee, come back,

31:12.706 --> 31:14.710
you critique. Golly, this missile came by me, and I 
saw it actually launch to the ground. Okay, you

31:19.258 --> 31:21.061
build up intelligence. It's SAMs. These are new 
things. More of them appeared. We started losing

31:24.868 --> 31:25.950
pilots. We've got to do something about this. So 
you've pinpointed on a map where the SAMs were

31:28.692 --> 31:32.798
installed. You always maintain your order of 
battle. You know exactly where they are. Okay, and

31:35.924 --> 31:43.797
so then you'd send in a first strike against the 
SAMs specifically, try to wipe them out, and then

31:35.924 --> 31:43.797
your bombers would go in right after that. Is that 
true? Yes, this is partially true. Okay, well,

31:47.082 --> 31:49.426
explain it to me exactly true. Okay, in addition, 
well... As the bombers go in, the fighter bombers,

31:53.403 --> 32:10.179
just preceding their strike is this flight of 
either two or four F-105, either to actually

31:53.403 --> 32:10.179
strike the SAM sites when they come up. See, they 
have to turn on their radars. When they turn on

32:12.100 --> 32:21.469
their radars to pick up our incoming bombers, 
that's when we can pick them up electronically and

32:12.100 --> 32:21.469
our instruments can point them. And we can fire the 
missiles out of them. They know this. And they know

32:27.850 --> 32:33.436
when we pick them up by our instrumentation, by 
their electronic pickups. So they have got to

32:34.798 --> 32:46.071
decide, am I going to turn my SAM radar equipment on 
in order to fire my SAMs and get this incoming

32:34.798 --> 32:46.071
missile from them and knock me out? Or am I going to, 
am I going to suffer that loss? Or should I keep my

32:52.094 --> 32:55.337
radars off and not use my SAMs. So it's ECM, 
electromagnetic warfare. We suppressed the SAMs

33:02.063 --> 33:12.933
with this flight of, I got to think of the name we 
called it, and we had special trained pilots to fly

33:02.063 --> 33:12.933
this. Boy, this was a nerve-wracking flight. Very 
nerve-wracking. And these boys got medals one

33:18.758 --> 33:21.240
right after another. But at least they could 
identify the missiles and know when they're being

33:22.013 --> 33:37.776
fired, whereas the bomber boys flying the bomber 
strike fighters, they might visually see a

33:22.013 --> 33:37.776
missile launch, going and see the... But they 
didn't have an electronic tool? No, but they

33:39.318 --> 33:41.741
could... The way the fighter bomber boys knew 
whether a missile was coming after them, if they

33:42.923 --> 33:50.434
could see the smoke from the... smoke trail of the 
missile, they knew it wasn't going to hit them. And

33:55.307 --> 33:57.049
by the way, they called them telephone poles. 
That's about the way they looked when they passed

33:57.109 --> 33:59.511
by and missed you. Looked like a telephone pole. 
Long, slim thing. You've seen pictures of it. But

34:05.477 --> 34:11.944
if you couldn't see them, the smoke trail behind 
them, that's pretty well, they were coming in your

34:05.477 --> 34:11.944
direction. Now, evasive tactics, and this was a 
problem. And rightfully so. If too many of these

34:19.491 --> 34:28.941
things were coming up at you, the air commander 
would make the decision to drop your bombs and take

34:19.491 --> 34:28.941
your bases back. In other words, save the airplane 
and save your, you know what, get back so we can come

34:28.961 --> 34:34.987
up again, and immediately dive. Turn and dive. So 
you dive down? Yeah, dive down. Into them? Well,

34:40.933 --> 34:45.177
dive down, because that's going to bury the... 
closing rate of the missile against you and also

34:45.494 --> 35:11.333
you're going to turn which means that the missile 
has to to take action the guy to get to you but it also

34:45.494 --> 35:11.333
changes the closing rate of the missile and 
therefore it explode above you probably when you

34:45.494 --> 35:11.333
do that and this was the famous favorite survival 
tactic turn and dive drop your bombs and when

34:45.494 --> 35:11.333
you've done that of course then You've got all the 
garbage off the bottom of your airplane and going

35:11.600 --> 35:22.513
to afterburner up to around Mach 1 because you're 
at low altitude, and you've got to get up to speed,

35:11.600 --> 35:22.513
otherwise MIGs catch you. See, the MIGs also in 
this that you're confined with, along with the SAM

35:22.534 --> 35:28.080
missiles. This gets complicated, and it gets 
ticklish, and it's tough, tough. And this is a

35:34.689 --> 35:37.192
problem we were confined with over there. Now, 
what about us? Let's move back just a second here,

35:38.650 --> 35:44.899
and this concerns the North Vietnamese. If we were 
having electronic warfare, and as soon as they

35:44.919 --> 35:55.735
turn their radar on, we could pick them up and try to 
shoot an air-to-surface missile into them.

35:56.456 --> 35:57.097
Surface to air? No, from our airplane. I'm sorry, 
air-to-surface. If we could try to do that, would

36:04.007 --> 36:07.071
they set up dummy radar stations? Well, see, 
that's ECM for you. They could, and probably did,

36:13.555 --> 36:17.321
set up some dummy stations. However... And that 
was on, and that hit you on the other one? Well, now,

36:20.146 --> 36:24.834
it just takes a while to explain all that. Now, in 
addition, in addition over there, we had what were

36:24.854 --> 36:30.544
called ECM aircraft. This is another element of 
air power. We had deployed Carat Air Force Base,

36:34.671 --> 36:38.295
Tockley Air Force Base. They were B-66 type 
aircraft, a twin-engine jet that had special

36:38.315 --> 36:56.714
electronic equipment on it for picking up any 
radar, any electronic mission that you might

36:38.315 --> 36:56.714
have, radar, radio, you name it, in North Vietnam, 
as well as these SAMs. And also, they had jamming

36:57.335 --> 36:59.637
equipment in them. Now, this aircraft flew in 
coordination with the airstrikes. And they flew

37:07.981 --> 37:17.714
generally at the periphery, around the periphery 
of the area. Plus the fact that they had to be

37:17.854 --> 37:23.582
protected to a certain extent sometimes by 
escort. We lost a few of these aircraft. And you

37:25.785 --> 37:30.552
see, when they have their jamming equipment on, 
this is a perfect target for a SAM. the SAM can home

37:30.768 --> 37:34.793
on that jamming equipment. However, if they're 
jamming the frequency of the SAM, then ain't no way

37:34.813 --> 37:43.185
that SAM is going to be able to hit them because he 
can't home on them. His direction

37:43.685 --> 37:55.161
radar and direction communication equipment is 
jammed. It's useless. In other words, you jam his

37:56.242 --> 37:59.847
guiding equipment. Of course, the ideal thing is 
to have these, and I can't think of the name, and

38:00.080 --> 38:06.466
I'll still have to go in. These, I thought of one of 
the names. The Shrike was the missile. How do you

38:14.013 --> 38:14.494
spell that? S-H-R-I-K-E. The Shrike was the 
missile, air to surface missile, that was carried

38:17.176 --> 38:28.467
by these specially equipped F-105 aircraft from 
Takli and Karat that launched this missile

38:28.902 --> 38:32.426
against the SAM sites. The threat of this 
aircraft, just by its way it flew, altitude,

38:33.467 --> 38:47.282
tactics and all, the North Vietnamese radar at 
their SAM site, they eventually could pick up and

38:33.467 --> 38:47.282
knew exactly what this flight was. They knew it and 
could identify it. And a lot of times we found they

38:50.505 --> 38:53.828
chose to stay off the air. They wouldn't even fire 
up their radar for their SAM sites. Well, we

38:59.533 --> 39:02.677
achieved success by just suppressing them that 
way. Suppressed them. They didn't choose to fire

39:04.720 --> 39:11.568
up because they knew that they'd have a missile 
launched against them. The most fatal thing in the

39:11.588 --> 39:22.281
world they could do was fire up and try to fire a 
missile against one of these some aircraft that

39:11.588 --> 39:22.281
was carrying a Shrike missile and stay that way, 
fired up with all their equipment on, then when we

39:22.565 --> 39:36.340
launched the strike missile, the strike missile 
would home in and hit their particular radar site,

39:22.565 --> 39:36.340
their particular SAM site, and destroy them. Of 
course, destroy the guiding equipment, radar and

39:36.360 --> 39:44.249
all, and of course, when we do that, we didn't care 
whether it destroyed the missile enough because

39:36.360 --> 39:44.249
he couldn't fire it. But, and it got to be a cat and 
mouse game. They'd go on and off the air. But the

39:52.012 --> 40:01.684
fact that they knew we had these X-type missiles, 
X-type aircraft up there, this was a suppression

39:52.012 --> 40:01.684
in itself. Just the threat of launching a missile 
was a threat. Now, if you recall in the later years

40:04.768 --> 40:20.348
of the war, where the B-52s finally were laid on for 
mass strikes against North Vietnam,

40:04.768 --> 40:20.348
the first requirement ahead of those B-52s was a 
full force of these special equipped F-105 strike

40:21.070 --> 40:31.902
loaded aircraft to hit them. And that's one reason 
we didn't lose hardly any B-52.

40:42.174 --> 40:48.681
Now, you said that after evasive action, as far as 
the missiles were concerned, Then you had to worry

40:49.437 --> 40:52.740
about the MiGs. Not after, during the same time. 
Okay, during the same time. How good were these

40:57.024 --> 41:01.148
MiGs compared to our aircraft? Were they the 
MiG-19s or the 21s? Oh, no, MiG-21s, some of the

41:04.051 --> 41:06.734
latest aircraft. How good were the 21s? The MiG-21 
was a good airplane. As a matter of fact, it shot

41:11.779 --> 41:14.341
some of our boys down. The F-4... was a good match 
for it. The F-105 was not so much, it wasn't as

41:21.033 --> 41:28.863
capable against the MiG as the F-4 was. We learned a 
lot about the MiG-21. For instance, I told you

41:32.107 --> 41:41.959
previously that the evasive tactics for the F-105 
against not only the missiles, but the MiGs as

41:32.107 --> 41:41.959
well, if they were jumped. And remember they 
loaded with bombs. There's no way they could fight

41:46.344 --> 41:47.946
a fighter to drop the bombs and then die. We learned 
through intelligence that the MiG-21, at a

41:52.658 --> 42:00.969
certain speed up toward Mach 1, it was very hard to 
control. The controls got stiff and almost froze.

42:05.275 --> 42:05.936
We learned that. And that's one of the reasons the 
idea was- Was it a slower speed? It was time to

42:09.461 --> 42:10.402
control? Slower than Mach 1. Yeah. That's the 
reason the F-105 pilots wanted to get to Mach 1 as

42:14.757 --> 42:22.025
fast as possible, diving and full afterburner. 
And then actually go out on the surface of the

42:22.045 --> 42:26.570
ground, going above the speed of sound. And the 
mate couldn't catch him because he was

42:28.351 --> 42:32.416
restricted. Now, the F-104, I mean, the F-4 was a 
more maneuverable aircraft and more of an

42:32.996 --> 42:41.385
air-to-air type of weapon. And that's one reason 
that the F-105s eventually bore the brunt of the

42:44.693 --> 42:51.659
bombing, whereas the F-4s did some bombing. But 
they were primarily, let's say, if you will, to

42:51.740 --> 42:57.625
escort a row to fight the MiGs. More F-4s shot down 
MiGs by four than F-105s. The MiG-21 is not the

43:04.892 --> 43:08.295
airplane. Our F-4 was . Why not? Explain this. The 
F-4 could outmaneuver it and outperform it. Good

43:20.241 --> 43:22.003
airplane. But the main difference was the pilot. 
What about armaments, though? Did they both have

43:25.868 --> 43:27.731
air-to-air missiles? Well, definitely we had 
air-to-air missiles. Eventually, the MiG-21s

43:30.694 --> 43:34.479
got missiles. But I think the biggest problem was 
the capability of the North Vietnamese maintain

43:41.377 --> 43:44.300
and actually fly their... The North Vietnamese 
pilots weren't probably as good as the Russian

43:44.320 --> 43:48.265
pilots. Oh, no comparison. No comparison. 
There's some evidence that at times some of the

43:51.309 --> 43:58.297
Russian pilots were flying on airplanes, but we 
can't prove that. I can't. I don't know for a fact.

44:00.279 --> 44:01.721
What evidence?

44:04.204 --> 44:09.811
Performance of the aircraft against some of our 
aircraft. Better maneuverability. better

44:12.275 --> 44:21.204
attack procedures,

44:12.275 --> 44:21.204
launching a missile at a proper time, just 
engagement. Techniques of a pilot, you could tell

44:21.224 --> 44:26.430
the difference. Pilot trained. Yeah. But the 
MiG-23, which was the airplane, I don't recall any

44:29.233 --> 44:34.939
MiG-23s showing up up there. But

44:36.200 --> 44:40.645
this was tough combat. And getting back to your 
basic question that led into all of this, the

44:41.131 --> 44:48.122
problem was, yeah, we had some morale problems. I 
had to go down to General Omar's headquarters at

44:48.963 --> 44:55.915
one time with a base commander, one of the base 
commanders. I won't mention his name. It finally

44:59.320 --> 45:05.029
came out that it was a matter of moral. You lose your 
buddies that many at a time, you know, 20% on each

45:05.870 --> 45:10.236
mission. That makes you think. We had the same 
problem in the 8th Air Force in World War II. Sure,

45:14.441 --> 45:15.843
might lose a lot of airplanes. But again, Bomar 
stuck to his philosophy. We'll just have to devise

45:21.771 --> 45:31.303
tactics and develop equipment, increase our ECM 
and capability against their defenses, but we're

45:21.771 --> 45:31.303
going to hit their targets. And eventually, when 
we got the laser-guided bomb, give us far more

45:31.323 --> 45:35.809
accuracy This was a giant stride in our 
effectiveness, much greater capability.

45:43.725 --> 45:54.039
Because a lot of times we did screw bombs around, 
just plain old tenseness and apprehension about

45:43.725 --> 45:54.039
missiles being fired at you. You can imagine a man 
in a fighter plane by himself with about 15, 20

45:54.319 --> 46:06.015
bombs on the bottom of his aircraft, making a pass. 
Knowing he's got to drop those bombs, let's say, on

46:06.282 --> 46:33.910
a power plant right in the middle of the city of 
Hanoi, which was called flying down the barrel

46:06.282 --> 46:33.910
because it was completely surrounded by 
innumerable missile sites, trying to

46:06.282 --> 46:33.910
concentrate on dropping those bombs on that 
particular target and pulling out around 12,000

46:06.282 --> 46:33.910
feet, and in the meantime being at perfect 
altitude for Sam to hit him take guts, G-U-T-S, it

46:34.514 --> 46:39.461
takes guts. That's for sure. And we lost pilots, 
but I take my hat off to them. And we continue to hit

46:46.792 --> 46:49.376
targets. We continue to be very effective. But the 
laser bomb really helped. Oh, definitely it

46:53.843 --> 46:55.645
helped. Definitely it helped. And, of course, one 
of those bombs, you could pinpoint right on the

46:56.647 --> 47:00.252
target. How effective was that as far as, I mean, 
how accurate was it? Oh, we had reconnaissance

47:04.388 --> 47:10.950
pictures where, like I quoted to you previously, 
we couldn't
