WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:10.022
After the war, when things kind of settled down, you moved to this house in 19... We built it in 1950.

00:10.282 --> 00:10.602
All right.

00:10.963 --> 00:14.388
After that, did you walk home to lunch?

00:14.728 --> 00:16.190
Or did you eat on campus?

00:16.211 --> 00:21.939
Well, between the time that Georgeville got a place to live, we lived up on Fairview, 301.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.022
Then I'd walk home for lunch.

00:24.242 --> 00:24.823
Okay.

00:24.955 --> 00:29.984
And then, but this is a little further, and I'd probably take the lunch, but I had a car then.

00:30.705 --> 00:36.996
And, of course, when George Bell, she had the car in Kansas City, and people just had one car back in those days.

00:38.298 --> 00:39.139
Sure, sure.

00:39.159 --> 00:47.233
The, after the war, as things settled down in 47-8, about how many were in the department, how many faculty?

00:49.222 --> 00:51.544
You know, I thought you might ask me that.

00:51.564 --> 00:52.425
I thought I'd better look at it.

00:52.946 --> 00:59.613
I can tell you how many were on the faculty in 1967 when I became department here.

00:59.633 --> 01:09.843
There were 13 faculty members in 1967, but there was a very rapid growth from after the war.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.786
We had a lot of veterans come back.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.448
We had the GI Bill of Rights.

01:14.829 --> 01:19.093
In fact, I went to Penn State on the GI Bill of Rights and finished my doctorate up there.

01:19.985 --> 01:24.511
At that time, I was the only person on the faculty who had a doctorate.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.594
All right, so let's trace that.

01:27.034 --> 01:29.698
You got out of the service about when?

01:30.439 --> 01:33.663
I got out of the service in August of 1946.

01:34.464 --> 01:41.454
I could have gotten out of the service earlier, but I had to wait until fall semester so I wouldn't be off the payroll.

01:42.375 --> 01:43.597
I had enough leave accumulated.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.060
Did you come back here and begin?

01:46.124 --> 01:49.229
I came back here and started teaching for the fall semester.

01:49.249 --> 01:50.711
And when did you go to Penn State?

01:52.414 --> 01:53.896
I went to Penn State in the summer times.

01:54.657 --> 01:55.979
Oh.

01:55.999 --> 01:59.144
So you were on the faculty here?

01:59.745 --> 02:03.350
Nine months and Penn State three months.

02:03.370 --> 02:05.854
Okay.

02:07.032 --> 02:18.646
Make believe that you were explaining to a young person today what those GI veterans were like as students, those after 1946, 7, 8.

02:19.848 --> 02:20.749
They were very serious.

02:21.890 --> 02:22.751
They were very mature.

02:23.832 --> 02:24.713
They'd been through a lot.

02:25.915 --> 02:30.981
They had families, a lot of them did, and they were very mature, very, very serious.

02:31.366 --> 02:38.836
And that changed the complexion of A&M quite a bit, because they weren't kids coming to college.

02:40.378 --> 02:43.702
And during that time, we also started something else.

02:44.042 --> 02:53.435
We started a PhD degree, pushing hubby through, because a lot of them were married, and every department had a wives' club.

02:54.356 --> 02:56.158
So we had a PE wives' club.

02:57.083 --> 03:08.299
Animal Science had an Animal Science Wives Club, and one of the faculty wives would be a sponsor, and Georgia Bell was the sponsor for our club, and they were very active.

03:08.820 --> 03:15.810
We'd have a program for them every month, and then when their husband graduated, we had a ceremony and gave the wife a Ph.T.

03:15.830 --> 03:20.997
diploma, which was the exact duplicate of the A&M diploma, except the wording was different.

03:21.938 --> 03:22.399
Oh, how good, how good.

03:22.700 --> 03:27.306
They lived, most of those veterans lived where?

03:28.167 --> 03:33.674
A&M did more than any school in the United States for returning veterans.

03:35.096 --> 03:40.524
We had, of course, we had the project houses here at the south part of the campus.

03:41.385 --> 03:46.952
We turned those into homes for veterans, four apartments in each one.

03:47.371 --> 03:52.760
And then we brought in barracks from different camps around to have at the North Gate.

03:53.962 --> 04:02.717
And they had one room, one bedroom apartment, was $28 a month, all utilities paid.

04:04.180 --> 04:08.607
Two bedrooms, $32 a month, all utilities paid.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.893
So they really did a lot for veterans.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.093
Were there also some trailers or other auxiliary down there?

04:16.194 --> 04:17.336
Yes, there were little Quonset huts.

04:17.356 --> 04:21.706
There were little Quonset huts where the tennis courts are now, some of the tennis courts.

04:21.726 --> 04:24.493
Did they have a, did that have a nickname?

04:24.713 --> 04:26.257
What was that area called?

04:27.620 --> 04:28.702
Was that just Vet Village?

04:30.466 --> 04:32.110
I don't really remember.

04:33.322 --> 04:38.207
And those were hard-working people.

04:38.607 --> 04:42.492
Then the enrollment went back down and kind of leveled off.

04:42.832 --> 04:43.673
Yes.

04:43.693 --> 04:43.973
All right.

04:44.073 --> 04:59.069
When Gilchrist becomes chancellor, who were some other key leaders in the late, in the 50s here at A&M?

05:00.270 --> 05:02.232
Presidents, deans?

05:03.359 --> 05:03.920
Okay.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.303
There was Morgan, was the president.

05:08.344 --> 05:09.865
Now, we had several acting presidents.

05:10.186 --> 05:14.670
Bolton was an acting president for a while, or maybe he was a temporary appointment, I don't know.

05:14.990 --> 05:18.013
And he was, primarily, he had been dean of engineering?

05:19.195 --> 05:22.778
Dean of engineering and dean of the A&M College.

05:22.798 --> 05:23.018
Oh, okay.

05:24.019 --> 05:24.820
And then there was Williams.

05:25.981 --> 05:29.805
He had been dean of the School of Agriculture.

05:31.186 --> 05:34.290
And see, after Williams, I think there was Morgan, probably.

05:34.891 --> 05:37.535
I can't name these and my memory's gone.

05:38.456 --> 05:40.940
But there was Morgan who came out of Wisconsin.

05:42.422 --> 05:52.396
And there was a kind of a problem with Morgan because I know that he moved out of the president's house and moved into a garage apartment.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.479
Then he went back to Michigan.

05:55.140 --> 05:56.181
He came from Michigan.

05:56.414 --> 06:08.313
I've heard in general that he wanted to make some changes, maybe some of those that later would be made.

06:08.714 --> 06:09.175
That's right.

06:09.195 --> 06:12.260
But at that point the board wasn't in harmony with it.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.302
Yes.

06:14.083 --> 06:17.308
Do you remember any first impressions of Earl Rudder?

06:20.326 --> 06:24.270
Yes, I guess for the first time that we really got to see, he came here as dean of engineering.

06:25.171 --> 06:27.192
No, no, that was Gilchrist did that.

06:27.853 --> 06:32.718
But Rudder came here as president.

06:33.198 --> 06:39.564
I think he was titled for the first few months, was executive vice president, but clearly he was going to be president.

06:39.664 --> 06:40.104
That's right.

06:40.765 --> 06:41.125
That's right.

06:41.406 --> 06:45.469
And Harrington was president.

06:45.590 --> 06:49.253
Now, Rudder is not a second place man.

06:50.313 --> 06:52.536
Did you get that impression early on?

06:52.556 --> 06:53.037
Pretty early.

06:54.519 --> 07:04.032
And when he came, of course he was president, but he was the man in charge.

07:04.853 --> 07:08.959
And you had, at that time when he was president, you had a chain of command.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.881
Things went through a chain of command.

07:11.963 --> 07:13.585
Your faculty member didn't go to the president.

07:14.246 --> 07:17.390
He went up the chain, and he came down the chain.

07:18.532 --> 07:19.273
Now was that?

07:20.688 --> 07:22.991
more rigid then than it had been?

07:23.011 --> 07:23.912
I think so.

07:26.435 --> 07:27.837
It was more military type.

07:28.057 --> 07:28.998
Okay.

07:29.018 --> 07:29.699
Okay.

07:31.040 --> 07:38.750
And soon after he got here, Frank Hubert then came as Dean of Arts and Sciences.

07:38.770 --> 07:39.370
Yes.

07:39.390 --> 07:49.142
And before Dean Hubert was Dean of Arts and Sciences, there was Dr. Oh, he was head of the Geography Department.

07:49.882 --> 07:51.905
Skip Schlesinger.

07:51.925 --> 07:52.906
Skip, that's right.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.711
He was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

07:56.931 --> 07:59.034
You see, because when I came there were only four colleges.

07:59.114 --> 08:00.496
Right.

08:00.516 --> 08:06.003
And the arts and sciences covered everything there was in agriculture or engineering or veterinary medicine.

08:06.323 --> 08:14.794
Now, did you people in arts and sciences feel that agriculture and engineering dominated the decision making?

08:15.255 --> 08:16.136
Oh, there wasn't any question.

08:16.817 --> 08:19.180
But that was the tone of the state.

08:21.404 --> 08:26.612
And of that, here on the campus, when Dean Kyle was here, Dean Kyle dominated.

08:26.632 --> 08:27.533
Oh, really?

08:28.254 --> 08:28.494
Yes.

08:28.795 --> 08:37.127
Now, I know, I've not asked anybody, describe Dean Kyle by... I couldn't because I didn't know him that well.

08:37.728 --> 08:39.451
I knew of him more than I knew him.

08:40.212 --> 08:42.735
But what did he look like physically?

08:43.016 --> 08:47.042
He was kind of a small man, and I really don't have that much recollection of him.

08:48.804 --> 08:50.567
Because I understand that...

08:50.885 --> 09:03.058
One of the reasons the football stadium got the name it did is that he made it clear it was his agriculture land that he was allowing them for getting them to use.

09:03.678 --> 09:03.919
Right.

09:04.119 --> 09:06.842
That it wasn't A&M's, it was agriculture's.

09:06.962 --> 09:08.063
Yes.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.125
That, that, that, that would pretty well it describes him.

09:11.186 --> 09:11.566
Let's see.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.348
Let me jump to the students.

09:13.789 --> 09:13.989
All right.

09:14.009 --> 09:19.795
In your classes, did you feel much difference in the capability

09:20.146 --> 09:25.433
of the ag, the engineering, the arts and sciences students?

09:26.715 --> 09:27.035
Not really.

09:27.796 --> 09:30.980
Were there supposedly better students in one area than the other?

09:32.863 --> 09:35.466
Well, of course, there were better students in any department.

09:35.827 --> 09:37.729
Yeah, right, but I mean there wasn't.

09:38.691 --> 09:41.855
But not in the college as a whole, as you take the college as a whole.

09:42.516 --> 09:48.904
What was a typical Aggie student's manner and style like in that era?

09:52.124 --> 09:53.426
Of course, they were all in the Corps.

09:53.446 --> 09:55.309
All in the Corps.

09:57.392 --> 10:11.372
They had a rank in the Corps, and they pretty well followed that, but they were outgoing, maybe a little close on the edge of being, since it was an all-male school, a little close on the edge of being kind of rowdy.

10:18.001 --> 10:19.684
But they were all well-behaved.

10:20.385 --> 10:22.047
Wasn't difficult for you to get

10:22.550 --> 10:24.392
to get a class to be orderly?

10:24.712 --> 10:25.032
No, no.

10:25.233 --> 10:25.493
No, no.

10:25.553 --> 10:27.895
You had it very easy, very easy.

10:28.276 --> 10:34.121
Now, most of the students in your classes were what class year?

10:35.683 --> 10:40.528
Well, when I was teaching in the required program, most of them would be in the freshman or sophomore year.

10:41.389 --> 10:41.489
Okay.

10:41.509 --> 10:44.552
But a lot of them would be taking it as an elective 301 and 302.

10:44.612 --> 10:44.952
Okay.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.695
But they were very easily controlled.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.818
They had never had any problem at all with discipline.

10:51.355 --> 10:53.317
And their class attendance was regular?

10:53.618 --> 10:54.619
Yes, very regular.

10:55.941 --> 11:02.228
Did, do you remember any kinds of pranks or jokes that they attempted that you remember?

11:04.171 --> 11:05.753
Jokes or pranks at anybody?

11:09.177 --> 11:16.806
I can remember some humorous occasions because they had the, they had the movie in Guy and Hall.

11:18.794 --> 11:27.185
And that was another thing that made the campus very, very close, because Mr. Putty was the guy that ran Guy and Hall.

11:27.625 --> 11:32.111
And the kids, like our children, never paid to get in to see a movie.

11:32.591 --> 11:37.277
He would give them flyers to distribute, then sack popcorn or something to get in free.

11:38.439 --> 11:42.564
And so that really brought us together as a very, very close community.

11:43.025 --> 11:47.991
But the students, I can remember, and these were two of my students,

11:49.928 --> 11:54.453
They both went on to be very successful.

11:55.894 --> 11:59.238
But we're having one of these movies where there are sword fights, you know, in them.

11:59.898 --> 12:02.061
And so they come across from Guy and Hall.

12:02.501 --> 12:03.222
They were on the stage.

12:03.502 --> 12:07.126
So they come across in front of the screen with a sword fight.

12:07.947 --> 12:11.851
And, you know, there'd be things like that that would happen.

12:11.871 --> 12:13.232
But there wasn't anything bad happened.

12:14.113 --> 12:16.436
I don't recall anything, pranks where there was anything.

12:17.397 --> 12:19.699
Was there ever anything in one of your classes?

12:20.168 --> 12:23.452
a prank that they attempted on another student?

12:23.472 --> 12:24.734
No, I can't recall one.

12:25.335 --> 12:27.097
I might be a bin, but I don't recall one.

12:28.078 --> 12:33.586
And did they ever attempt any pranks in a faculty member's yard or?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.388
I can't remember one.

12:35.448 --> 12:36.630
Nobody's car ever got painted?

12:37.411 --> 12:37.591
No.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.652
I've never heard of that.

12:38.973 --> 12:43.819
I've never heard of any damage being done to any faculty member's home or any pranks being done.

12:43.879 --> 12:46.142
I've heard a lot of drowned outs.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.734
Oh, that was on the dorm, yeah.

12:48.754 --> 12:49.315
On the campus.

12:49.736 --> 12:52.281
Yeah, that was on the dorm, on each other.

12:53.563 --> 12:54.264
All right, let's see.

12:54.685 --> 13:03.662
Back to the, your, who were your dearest colleagues in your department, the ones that you cherished the most?

13:04.684 --> 13:08.772
Well, of course, Mr. Dow, because he was my college prof.

13:10.692 --> 13:15.116
And his daughter's like an adopted daughter, like a second daughter to us.

13:15.736 --> 13:18.899
And she has a son here at A&M now that's a freshman.

13:20.761 --> 13:23.823
Then Carl Tischler and, of course, Mr. Penny.

13:24.944 --> 13:28.628
And then Colonel Frank Andy Anderson.

13:29.108 --> 13:38.076
The first people that have George Bell and I over to the house for dinner was Colonel and Mrs. Andy Anderson.

13:38.376 --> 13:40.598
Please share some information about them.

13:41.911 --> 13:46.720
Well, Colonel Andy was a man, it's right or it's wrong, you know.

13:48.263 --> 13:52.851
And he was too old.

13:52.971 --> 13:56.578
He was a colonel, a full colonel.

13:56.598 --> 14:03.170
He was called into active duty, and they said, you're too old to go to combat.

14:03.711 --> 14:04.813
He says, I won't out.

14:06.667 --> 14:10.432
And there wasn't a man probably in the combat unit that was as good a man as he was.

14:11.834 --> 14:18.062
Because he was, at his age of 50 or whatever he was, he was in tremendous shape.

14:18.463 --> 14:23.830
He could have outfought any... But he still didn't get... He didn't get to go, so he'd come back to the university.

14:24.992 --> 14:26.334
See, he'd been commandant here too.

14:26.394 --> 14:36.167
And those two then... Describe Colonel Andy physically.

14:36.687 --> 14:39.631
Kern Andrew was a small, very well-built man.

14:41.554 --> 14:42.375
Very well-built man.

14:42.996 --> 14:44.418
And he coached track?

14:44.738 --> 14:45.459
He coached track.

14:46.220 --> 14:49.285
And he was also assistant football coach for a while.

14:49.645 --> 14:51.468
But he coached track forever, didn't he?

14:51.488 --> 14:51.728
Yes.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.511
Had some very winning teams.

14:56.455 --> 14:56.896
Yes, yes.

14:56.916 --> 14:58.678
And did they live on campus?

14:59.401 --> 15:06.792
They did, but when we came, they had already moved off the campus and lived over in Fairview, just down a few houses from where we were living.

15:07.433 --> 15:11.078
And so he was in the Department of Physical Education?

15:11.098 --> 15:11.719
Physical Education.

15:11.759 --> 15:14.743
All right.

15:14.883 --> 15:17.267
Any younger dear colleagues?

15:22.655 --> 15:23.896
Give me a think, let me think.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.680
Oh yeah, Mameliga.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.463
Amo Mameliga was a very close friend.

15:29.978 --> 15:39.149
He was a man that could diagnose if you had something hurting you or you had a limp or muscles hurting you.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.510
He was better than anybody I've ever known.

15:41.011 --> 15:48.139
I've never known anyone, doctor or anyone else, that was good at diagnosing and correcting his mammalica.

15:48.479 --> 15:50.041
Now, what was his teaching area?

15:50.301 --> 15:55.628
His teaching area was kinesiology, and he also had charge of our remedial program.

15:56.128 --> 15:59.412
Now, I remembered him as the head trainer, don't I?

15:59.628 --> 16:02.932
No, he was over in our department.

16:03.213 --> 16:06.697
They sent a lot of people with injuries over to him for rehabilitation.

16:07.478 --> 16:08.179
Okay, maybe that was it.

16:08.540 --> 16:14.087
Because I got a real bad charley horse one time as a young faculty member.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.510
Yeah, this injured him.

16:16.730 --> 16:19.594
And I went over and he told me what to do and it worked.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.361
Yeah, he wasn't a trainer.

16:21.401 --> 16:31.956
He was on, but he's, that was, and, you know, now he had, he had trained the trainers.

16:31.976 --> 16:36.703
He had, he was in charge of, you know, the trainer program.

16:36.803 --> 16:38.666
It was in the rehabilitation.

16:39.047 --> 16:48.400
Other than Colonel Andy, were there other coaches who were full-time members of the department?

16:48.785 --> 16:50.387
During the war, Ray Putnam was.

16:52.589 --> 16:57.255
He was an economics prof, but during the war, he was a full-time physical education man.

16:57.275 --> 17:00.579
He was assistant track coach.

17:00.599 --> 17:01.820
Where were y'all housed?

17:05.104 --> 17:07.487
When I came here, you know, there was Old DeWare.

17:09.389 --> 17:14.094
Okay, you know that little building that's just on this side of where DeWare Fieldhouse was?

17:14.855 --> 17:16.277
That was the athletic department.

17:17.287 --> 17:22.553
And so was the offices on the east side of Dewar Fieldhouse.

17:22.953 --> 17:24.495
That was athletic offices also.

17:25.836 --> 17:33.845
And our offices were back, as you went down the steps from Dewar Fieldhouse, just a few steps, there was kind of a dressing room on the right.

17:35.747 --> 17:39.271
As you come into Dewar Fieldhouse, there was an office on the right.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.452
It was just a small office.

17:41.574 --> 17:43.716
Secretary in there and

17:44.995 --> 17:49.782
Where did y'all meet your courses, those courses that were in the lecture hall?

17:49.802 --> 17:50.423
I'll tell you what.

17:51.144 --> 17:56.973
We met those in a lecture hall in a room which was on the south side of Dewar.

17:57.654 --> 18:00.398
And during a football game, it was a dressing room.

18:00.918 --> 18:05.585
And we'd come back in there on Monday, and there'd be shoulder pads and so forth all over the room.

18:06.366 --> 18:13.737
And it was right next to the, it was right next to the, where they passed out the equipment and so forth.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.565
So that was the visiting team's dressing area?

18:17.606 --> 18:22.514
No, the visiting team's dressing area was under Kyle Field.

18:22.674 --> 18:23.255
Oh, okay.

18:23.315 --> 18:25.899
So you're saying a home dressing?

18:26.160 --> 18:27.181
That was a home dressing.

18:27.382 --> 18:27.862
My, my, my.

18:29.806 --> 18:30.407
Now, let's see.

18:30.507 --> 18:32.670
Classes began at 8 o'clock.

18:33.111 --> 18:33.592
Yeah.

18:33.612 --> 18:39.441
And you had sometimes afternoon classes until pretty close to 5 o'clock.

18:39.461 --> 18:40.483
Pretty close to 5 o'clock.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.943
And then on Saturdays, 8 till noon.

18:43.963 --> 18:44.223
Right.

18:45.685 --> 18:53.553
And so on a football game day, home game, people were looking at their watches, I'll bet, in the 11 to 12 class.

18:55.455 --> 18:58.158
Well, they pretty well take care of those.

18:59.299 --> 19:03.664
You know, they were all gone by the time we get from all over the campus, you know.

19:05.045 --> 19:10.251
In your early years, did anyone ever ask you either in fact

19:10.467 --> 19:15.873
or by inference about the fact that you hadn't gone to A&M, but you were on the faculty here?

19:18.196 --> 19:24.524
There were a lot of faculty members who were former A&M students, a lot of them.

19:24.704 --> 19:25.865
No one ever brought that up.

19:26.005 --> 19:28.769
No one ever questioned if you were an Aggie or anything?

19:28.789 --> 19:29.890
No.

19:29.910 --> 19:30.150
All right.

19:30.170 --> 19:39.141
Now, when I got here with a Rice PhD and an undergraduate degree from Austin College, I was comparatively negative about A&M.

19:39.442 --> 19:48.210
But after five or six years, the roots got really, really deep, and our attachment grew, and that's why we've decided to spend the rest of our days here.

19:48.790 --> 19:53.394
How long did it take you to begin to feel like A&M was part of your soul?

19:54.015 --> 19:59.419
Well, I had always wanted to teach in college, and A&M was one of the places I wanted to teach.

19:59.780 --> 20:08.287
And I got this call, got that call from Mr. Penberthy, and there wasn't any second thoughts in my mind.

20:08.307 --> 20:09.448
That's where I wanted to go.

20:10.272 --> 20:20.826
And so when I got here, there was a very warm faculty group that met and greeted me very warmly and I couldn't have been, I was real happy from the word go.

20:21.607 --> 20:31.740
Now did you ever, in your professional career, did you ever, were you ever tempted by an offer elsewhere that caused you to have to think about it?

20:32.632 --> 20:38.359
I had an offer from other places, one or two, but not a whole lot of them, but I never was tempted.

20:38.379 --> 20:44.385
I had decided this is where I wanted to spend the rest of my life.

20:44.405 --> 20:46.268
This was home.

20:46.348 --> 20:54.597
It was just so warm, the community was warm, the university was just what I was hoping it would be, and it was just where I wanted to be home.

20:55.398 --> 20:58.842
All right, let's go chronologically back to when Rudder got here.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.189
in the late 50s.

21:00.349 --> 21:09.747
Did you sense very early that things were going to be a little different, that there was going to be some changing with Rudder?

21:11.270 --> 21:11.350
Yes.

21:11.370 --> 21:16.139
We'd have a faculty meeting at the first year, at the first of the year, in Cain Hall.

21:16.159 --> 21:16.780
Do you remember those?

21:18.582 --> 21:28.302
And Earl Rudder says, you know, during the 60s, particularly during the 60s, and there were unrest on many campuses throughout the country.

21:29.404 --> 21:30.386
And he made it very clear.

21:30.948 --> 21:36.098
He says, now we brought you here because you're an expert in your field to teach your field.

21:36.599 --> 21:39.325
We did not bring you here to run the university.

21:40.132 --> 21:46.259
And, you know, there's another quote that's given to him, if you don't like it, Highway 6 runs north and south.

21:46.279 --> 21:48.782
I don't know where, I can't remember where he said that or not.

21:49.743 --> 21:54.988
Well, you see, when I, as a junior faculty member, at first heard some of that.

21:55.229 --> 21:55.449
Yeah.

21:55.569 --> 21:56.130
That was recent.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.292
I was a little bit turned off.

21:58.312 --> 21:58.512
Yeah.

21:58.633 --> 22:04.019
Then later, I began to say, no, I agree with him.

22:04.039 --> 22:04.299
I understand.

22:04.319 --> 22:07.502
The, early in the 60s, there was a committee.

22:07.522 --> 22:08.123
When did you come?

22:08.143 --> 22:08.564
59.

22:08.584 --> 22:09.885
59.

22:10.557 --> 22:23.195
the Aspirations Committee was appointed faculty and staff to, and I happened to be a junior member of it, and by being the junior member, I got to be the secretary, therefore right and forth.

22:23.815 --> 22:32.247
Do you remember any feeling about co-education and non-compulsory core among you and your faculty friends?

22:34.610 --> 22:35.772
What was the first reaction?

22:36.815 --> 22:38.819
I don't think any of them were opposed to it.

22:39.240 --> 22:44.571
I think it presented a problem to us, because it presented a problem to the campus.

22:45.433 --> 22:46.556
There were no ladies' restrooms.

22:47.177 --> 22:47.979
Right.

22:47.999 --> 22:49.081
Except for secretaries.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.043
Right.

22:50.063 --> 22:52.328
And that didn't take, you know, very many stalls.

22:52.689 --> 22:53.931
They were few and far between, yeah?

22:53.951 --> 22:54.773
Yes.

22:55.124 --> 22:59.169
And of course it presented a problem to us because we didn't have dressing facilities.

22:59.669 --> 23:06.857
But what we did, we used the visiting basketball team's dressing room for a girl's dressing room.

23:07.058 --> 23:07.358
Really?

23:08.679 --> 23:08.840
Yeah.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.161
In G. Raleigh?

23:11.042 --> 23:13.184
In G. Raleigh.

23:14.506 --> 23:15.227
I didn't know that.

23:15.407 --> 23:16.068
I didn't know that.

23:16.408 --> 23:16.588
Yeah.

23:16.608 --> 23:24.237
Do you remember any kinds of accidents, goofy problems, or anything with the coming of coeducation?

23:26.242 --> 23:26.542
No.

23:26.783 --> 23:34.675
Do you remember any faculty member having said something that for an all-male audience was okay, but for a female audience it wasn't?

23:35.516 --> 23:36.558
No, I never really did.

23:37.940 --> 23:49.999
I heard a few stories in veterinary medicine of certain faculty members that for years and years had been giving various biological examples of this or that, and it didn't work quite well, quite as well.

23:50.319 --> 23:52.182
I heard the same stories.

23:52.853 --> 23:56.979
and a few storytellers.

23:58.581 --> 23:59.022
Let's see.

24:01.786 --> 24:06.633
Did Dean Hubert change arts and sciences any when he came, as you recall?

24:09.116 --> 24:13.662
Dean Hubert was a very good administrator, very good.

24:16.246 --> 24:21.814
I think he probably took over a little more command of the position.

24:24.173 --> 24:27.538
It became more of a, that you talk to Dean Hubert about things.

24:29.080 --> 24:34.127
Skipper wasn't, you know, administratively, he wasn't.

24:35.228 --> 24:39.074
Now, who was the department head in the early 60s for you?

24:39.134 --> 24:39.674
Carl Tischler.

24:40.175 --> 24:40.896
Oh, Carl.

24:40.916 --> 24:41.237
Okay.

24:41.717 --> 24:43.560
And he was department head 10, 12 years?

24:44.501 --> 24:47.285
He was the department head until I became department head.

24:49.388 --> 24:49.488
Okay.

24:49.508 --> 24:52.392
So he was the department head from the time that Finberthy

24:52.743 --> 24:55.989
Went up as dean of men until I became department head.

24:56.991 --> 24:59.475
I was the third department head in the department.

25:00.778 --> 25:03.102
Describe his style and manner of leading.

25:03.323 --> 25:08.893
Very easygoing, very quiet, easygoing, very meticulous.

25:08.913 --> 25:16.607
When he left his office, everything on top of his desk was exactly so, but he was very easygoing.

25:17.279 --> 25:27.452
And one or two times in departmental meetings, if I had been department head, I would have told somebody to shut up, but he didn't.

25:27.472 --> 25:28.794
He was just very easygoing.

25:29.715 --> 25:31.777
He's a very well-mannered person.

25:32.659 --> 25:34.060
He was a gentleman.

25:36.203 --> 25:36.423
All right.

25:36.443 --> 25:41.850
My mind jumps to an old conversation with Fred Benson.

25:41.870 --> 25:46.476
I was talking to him about faculty-family interaction.

25:47.114 --> 25:48.616
Yeah.

25:48.636 --> 25:59.853
When you and your wife and other faculty families got together, were there any unwritten rules about do's and don'ts?

26:01.135 --> 26:01.996
No.

26:02.397 --> 26:08.707
Did people smoke indoors at those faculty get-togethers?

26:09.368 --> 26:09.628
Yes, I guess.

26:10.047 --> 26:12.550
Was it acceptable for a woman to smoke?

26:13.090 --> 26:13.351
Yes.

26:13.871 --> 26:21.399
Now, there are certain women that smoked, but I don't remember any of the women on our wives that smoked.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.002
Was it okay to serve wine?

26:24.042 --> 26:27.065
No.

26:28.567 --> 26:36.055
He told me it wasn't okay to play cards with the shades open, that if you had a card game, you closed the shades.

26:37.418 --> 26:38.680
We didn't play many cards.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.141
We played 42.

26:40.282 --> 26:44.087
That was acceptable.

26:44.347 --> 26:47.291
What other entertainments were there?

26:47.311 --> 26:59.186
Well, we played other cards like Old Maid and there's another game where you collect a lot of things you bid and I can't remember the name of those things.

26:59.206 --> 27:03.291
Well, that's not the one I'm thinking about where you

27:05.701 --> 27:09.267
Anyway, there's a lot of interaction between the players.

27:09.287 --> 27:11.430
A lot of interaction between the players.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.313
Georgeville would remember the name, but I don't.

27:15.036 --> 27:20.565
Who were, for you and your wife, who were your closest faculty friends?

27:20.585 --> 27:29.680
Well, we were close friends with the Tishers, the Dows, and then, of course, all of our friends through church were members of the faculty also.

27:29.700 --> 27:30.201
Okay.

27:30.221 --> 27:31.303
Who were some of them?

27:31.368 --> 27:36.636
The Sorensons, Romy Sorensen, he was in ag engineering.

27:37.598 --> 27:44.449
And the pots, and he was in chemistry.

27:45.511 --> 27:49.617
And the streets, he was engineering graphics.

27:50.839 --> 27:54.625
And I will tell you, Haskell,

27:56.157 --> 27:58.740
My recall on things was pretty bad.

27:58.760 --> 27:58.960
All right.

27:58.980 --> 28:07.610
If a student came to you and wanted some general academic advice, who would you have recommended that student go to?

28:09.072 --> 28:11.654
We didn't have anybody at first except, you know, yourself.

28:12.175 --> 28:13.276
Right, but.

28:13.296 --> 28:15.799
Because the faculty members did the, did the advising.

28:18.342 --> 28:23.768
But we didn't have a, well, we did, we had a, oh, up in the,

28:27.123 --> 28:41.882
Up across from Guyon Hall, we had, across from Sabisa Hall, we had a department that, which kind of service, I can't remember the names.

28:42.082 --> 28:43.384
Austin Curley and his crew?

28:43.404 --> 28:45.988
Austin Curley, yes, and his crew, that's right.

28:46.729 --> 28:55.560
And then, see, when I got here, there were associate or assistant deans like Dick Potts,

28:55.760 --> 28:58.984
There was somebody at Randall in engineering.

29:00.286 --> 29:03.911
Yes, there was kind of the student advisor that handled student problems.

29:05.053 --> 29:14.646
When did, now, you all added the doctoral program in, and was it then Health and Physical Education?

29:14.746 --> 29:15.207
Yes.

29:15.227 --> 29:19.152
Now, you see, we changed the name of our department because at first,

29:19.773 --> 29:23.921
If you were certified to teach physical education, health was just a part of it.

29:24.642 --> 29:27.427
Then it became a separate deal.

29:27.447 --> 29:40.110
I don't remember just the exact year that it was divided, but then we changed the name of the department to Health and Physical Education.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.923
I'd say we had 13 members when I became as department head.

29:48.383 --> 29:49.625
And when I retired, we had 55.

29:49.645 --> 29:50.005
55?

29:50.786 --> 29:51.927
Yes.

29:52.407 --> 29:54.229
So that's from 60?

29:54.249 --> 29:55.650
67.

29:55.670 --> 29:56.811
To 79.

29:56.831 --> 29:58.413
To 79.

29:58.453 --> 30:00.254
12 years.

30:00.855 --> 30:02.537
Wow.

30:02.577 --> 30:08.262
And your hardest job as a department head was finding qualified faculty members.

30:08.722 --> 30:08.923
All right.

30:08.943 --> 30:10.024
Let's talk about that in a minute.

30:10.464 --> 30:11.565
Where did you...

30:12.946 --> 30:14.748
How did you go about finding those?

30:15.088 --> 30:22.757
Well, most of the cases, we advertised in the professional journals.

30:24.199 --> 30:31.367
And then I went to the professional meetings, and I listed jobs there, and I interviewed people there.

30:33.609 --> 30:42.379
And through those avenues is where we found most of our- You also knew some key people to call.

30:42.815 --> 30:44.758
to get direct information, didn't you?

30:45.779 --> 30:48.243
Didn't you have some acquaintances you knew you could trust?

30:48.844 --> 30:49.424
Oh, yes.

30:49.444 --> 30:56.995
Yes, that's when we would find a person we thought was qualified.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.177
We'd call people.

30:59.218 --> 31:09.593
And by the same token, when I was in charge of our majors before I became department head, I never had a graduate that I did not find a job for.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.197
It may not be where he wanted to be,

31:12.751 --> 31:22.406
exactly the job he wanted, but I knew so many people over in administration over the state that I could call and place an individual.

31:23.027 --> 31:25.651
But we used the same procedure in hiring.

31:27.193 --> 31:28.956
Yes.

31:31.039 --> 31:37.409
Now, with coeducation, the courses had to change a good bit.

31:38.210 --> 31:39.552
Yes.

31:40.662 --> 31:41.286
Go on.

31:41.367 --> 31:42.656
Talk about that, please.

31:44.086 --> 31:46.302
Well, it is.
