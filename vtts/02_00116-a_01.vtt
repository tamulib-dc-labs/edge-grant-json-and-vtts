WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:06.084
August 29, testing, testing. Yes, sir. Testing 1, 
2, 3, 4. This is August 29th, and we're at 905

00:11.229 --> 00:15.333
Carmel. And I have the honor and pleasure of 
chatting with General Randolph. Randolph.

00:21.458 --> 00:21.999
Randolph. OLPH. And about his days as a student at 
Texas A&M. To begin with, Describe family and

00:32.498 --> 00:37.142
background and growing up and what did mom and dad 
do? Brief biographical summary before you came to

00:37.949 --> 00:42.836
A&M. Okay, sir. It was pretty simple. I was born in 
Corpus right at the end of the war, 45, July 45. My

00:50.127 --> 00:51.910
daddy was in essential industry. He was a 
petroleum engineer out of LSU. He was working for

00:54.173 --> 01:01.163
Standard Stanley Oil, and he ran oil field camps. 
He was the head engineer. In 46, he moved to

01:03.066 --> 01:07.112
Houston. The family moved to Houston, and he went 
to work as the chief petroleum engineer for Wesley

01:07.092 --> 01:14.243
West. And so I lived in the same house from 46 to 
September of 63 when I went to A&M, the same room.

01:23.538 --> 01:29.708
Went to River Oaks Elementary School, Lanier 
Junior High School, Lamar High School. Mainly

01:30.582 --> 01:37.190
played football, did other sports, but 
everything was secondary to football. And then my

01:38.412 --> 01:52.489
other interests besides hunting and fishing, 
which my grandfather, who was a Teddy Roosevelt

01:38.412 --> 01:52.489
environmentalist but didn't realize it, at the 
time taught me the art and the finer points of the

01:52.621 --> 02:02.648
outdoors and hunting and fishing. enjoying the 
outdoors, but we, my father bought, started

02:03.539 --> 02:16.575
buying some acreage in Grimes County, Texas, 65 
miles north of Houston in the 50s. And by 1957

02:17.736 --> 02:24.484
through 4-H and everything, I was raising 
registered Angus cattle and quarter horses and

02:24.464 --> 02:44.924
breaking horses and rodeoing and calf roping and 
really focused on the ranch, the farm and the ranch

02:24.464 --> 02:44.924
activities, although living in Houston was 
spending most of my time, especially after I got my

02:24.464 --> 02:44.924
driver's license, up at the ranch. Came to Texas 
A&M

02:51.920 --> 02:55.243
The first time I ever came here, I was swimming. I 
was a high school swimmer because that was one

02:55.283 --> 03:03.431
thing that didn't conflict with football as far as 
the seasons went. And I came to the state meet. The

03:05.513 --> 03:16.203
Texas state meet was in the old dungeon where the 
zone sits on top of my swimming pool now. The P.L.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.307
Downs Natatorium. Right. And that was my first 
trip, and I saw the cadets and everything, but was

03:20.945 --> 03:27.111
focused on the swimming meet. What was your 
impression from that visit? That very orderly

03:30.901 --> 03:33.243
place. I'd been to Rice. I'd played football at the 
Rice University, Rice Institute Stadium. And so

03:38.708 --> 03:41.951
that was in my hometown, and I'd seen a lot of Rice. 
And so when I came to A&M, I thought it was a very

03:42.071 --> 03:51.139
disciplined campus compared to the Rice campus. 
That was my two comparisons. But you had no A&M

03:54.823 --> 03:57.605
family. No. My mother and dad went to LSU. my 
brother my older brother went to Tulane and so I it

04:00.888 --> 04:25.596
was my senior year at a high school that I said well I 
want to be a veterinarian because I was kind of

04:00.888 --> 04:25.596
that's all I really enjoyed doing was working on 
horses and I was going to be my goal was to be a A rodeo

04:25.863 --> 04:27.206
veterinarian. I knew I wasn't a good enough calf 
roper to make it big time calf roping, but I loved to

04:27.446 --> 04:33.217
do it. And I liked rodeo clowning. I was a clown for 
four years. But you couldn't make a lot of money

04:39.569 --> 04:45.340
enough to support yourself, so I said, well, I'll 
be the rodeo vet. and I'll take care of all the

04:45.708 --> 04:48.811
quarter horses on the circuit. And so I went to, I 
came up here and I met, who later became my advisor,

04:48.831 --> 04:55.959
Dr. Romaine, out at the vet school. And talked to 
him and, you know, he figured out right quick I knew

04:57.000 --> 05:09.893
a lot about horses and that I was, you know, just had 
a natural, we went out to the stables and And he

05:10.632 --> 05:14.237
could just tell I knew a lot about horses. And so he 
was encouraged me to apply to A&M. I don't remember

05:20.206 --> 05:27.957
anything at all about the application being 
accepted or anything. I just know that it was the

05:28.017 --> 05:30.981
only place I applied. If you were a Texan and you 
wanted to go to vet school, you went to A&M for

05:31.803 --> 05:37.130
pre-vet. I mean, there was no... You could have 
gone to Sam Houston State or something and

05:38.915 --> 05:46.988
transferred over, but it was kind of a 
cut-and-dried situation. In 1963? 1963. And so I

05:49.351 --> 05:51.535
came up here. My mother brought me up. Just to 
enroll? To enroll. No, just to enroll. I don't

06:00.089 --> 06:00.890
remember. I probably drove myself up to see Dr. 
Romain because it takes 35 minutes to get from the

06:02.652 --> 06:07.697
farm. So, you know, on Highway 30, I would just cut 
through. And I was in and around this place all the

06:10.340 --> 06:13.823
time. And so I probably came up to see him by myself. 
But I remember my mother and Mrs. Jessie

06:17.507 --> 06:23.113
Gallagher, who was a nurse, a nurse, A Houston 
nurse, longtime friend of the family's, drove me

06:23.093 --> 06:26.837
up. And except for football cleats, I'd never worn 
shoes. I'd always worn cowboy boots. And so my

06:35.306 --> 06:45.316
memory of coming on the campus was they cut my hair 
off. And I'd never had long hair, but they cut it

06:45.396 --> 06:47.679
off. And I didn't like that. and um and then they 
made me wear shoes that we went to you know uh what is

06:52.051 --> 07:19.594
the military is called the cif the central issue 
facility i'm sure i'm not sure what it was called at

06:52.051 --> 07:19.594
a m at the time but they issued us our khakis and and 
you know our uniforms and they they um issued us

06:52.051 --> 07:19.594
some black leather shoes and then that day we 
shined them and and um and i had to wear them and i I

07:20.468 --> 07:23.791
absolutely detested wearing shoes. I thought 
they were the worst looking things, and they

07:24.191 --> 07:28.876
weren't comfortable. And being a short guy, I 
liked the high heels that the cowboy boots gave me,

07:28.976 --> 07:35.162
another inch and a half of height. I didn't get that 
from the loafer shoes, the military shoes. But I

07:40.947 --> 07:43.730
went into A3 Vet. Just saying, let me interrupt 
that. Now, when you came up that day to enroll, Who

07:48.599 --> 07:52.404
brought you and what stuff did you bring with you? 
Well, that's really interesting because today

07:52.424 --> 07:55.367
I'd go to jail. My mother brought me up. And, you 
know, the fall is when hunting season starts.

08:02.916 --> 08:08.423
Matter of fact, I'm leaving Friday to break in the 
2001 season at our lease in South Texas. So I came up

08:09.364 --> 08:15.331
with my shotgun, my rifle, and I used a straight 
razor. That's what I shaved with. And that's just

08:17.810 --> 08:20.453
what I had. And nobody said anything. The rifle was 
a Winchester Model 94. I'm sure I had five bullets

08:29.605 --> 08:32.990
in the magazine. The shotgun was a Remington Model 
31 pump. It was my granddad's, and I'm sure I had two

08:38.837 --> 08:44.805
7 1⁄2s in the magazine. And they stayed in my 
closet. And the only thing, and then that straight

08:47.324 --> 08:51.889
razor was in my room there in my foot locker. And the 
only thing I remember about that, I mean, the only,

08:52.670 --> 09:04.943
there was never a question was having a gun on 
campus, but the both guns and the straight razor

08:52.670 --> 09:04.943
had to be ready for inspection. So they were the 
cleanest they'd ever been in their lives because

09:05.143 --> 09:11.350
they had to be ready for all those inspections. And 
so I always had a couple of things to clean up that

09:12.111 --> 09:16.656
other people didn't have. but nobody said 
anything, and I don't remember bringing anything

09:17.024 --> 09:23.437
else. You didn't bring no hats, and what about 
other, did you bring it all in the foot locker,

09:24.639 --> 09:30.831
whatever you did bring? Well, I did, but because 
our ranch was here, I had all my clothes 35 miles

09:31.132 --> 09:39.268
away, And then, initially, I didn't have a car 
because it just didn't seem like it wasn't

09:39.687 --> 09:46.557
discussed. But very quickly, I made good enough 
grades at the break point in the fall semester.

09:55.410 --> 09:56.572
There was a break point there. And if you made a 
certain GPR, all of a sudden, you got all kinds of

09:56.592 --> 10:00.718
freedoms. But until that point, we were 
sequestered. We never left the campus and

10:04.184 --> 10:09.171
everything except I was running these cattle. 
these registered cattle. I mean, they were my

10:11.282 --> 10:12.444
cattle. And so I fairly early on snuck my Jeep, I had 
a Jeep, and snuck the Jeep onto campus. And I'm not

10:22.662 --> 10:24.225
even sure where I parked it. I didn't park it behind 
17 then. It was later that I parked it behind 17. But

10:27.971 --> 10:33.741
I would sneak out of Durham 17 at 1 o'clock in the 
morning. go check my cattle, just make the rounds

10:33.991 --> 10:42.960
with the headlights, and be back by three or four, 
you know, and we just, nobody know the difference.

10:42.980 --> 10:46.243
And I didn't cause any trouble, but, you know, the 
cattle had to be checked. I had a fellow, a friend, a

10:46.303 --> 10:53.690
neighbor, who I talked to just today, he was 
feeding them for me. But, you know, and salting and

10:54.752 --> 10:59.917
everything, but, you know, it was my cattle. So I 
remember that was kind of an early issue, and then

11:03.944 --> 11:09.895
someone said, well, if you make a certain grade 
point ratio, you can have a car and you can leave

11:03.944 --> 11:09.895
campus. And I said, during the day? I mean, you 
know, like, I could leave, you know, legally? And

11:15.807 --> 11:19.113
so that was my incentive to study real hard. Now, 
when your mom left you that day, Do you remember any

11:23.857 --> 11:28.582
advice or counsel that she gave you or your dad had 
given you the night before? No, it's interesting.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.425
My brother and I have talked about it. My dad was a 
product of the Depression. You know, he'd gone

11:33.547 --> 11:37.951
through World War II, and he did not give advice. He 
was a heck of a role model as a work ethic, a work

11:39.132 --> 11:45.278
ethic role model. He was prepared for the next 
Depression. He was prepared for the next World War

11:47.300 --> 11:49.182
II. But he wasn't a philosopher. You know, he 
didn't give advice. My mom, mother has, and she's

11:54.830 --> 12:04.401
82 in Houston and is in great health and doing 
wonderful. She's had something that she told me

12:05.142 --> 12:10.128
then and she's told me a million times since. And 
she says everything always works out for the best.

12:14.253 --> 12:16.216
So she says don't worry about things. I was a 
certain, to a certain degree, a worrier. And she

12:20.827 --> 12:22.569
knew that, I guess. And she says, you know, Randy, 
things will work out for the best. And then I

12:26.733 --> 12:35.020
noticed as things would go on and I would call home, 
very seldom did I talk to my dad. But mother, I'd

12:37.062 --> 12:38.804
always talk to mom. And if I ever was feeling down or 
had a, you know, was going to do something that she

12:39.565 --> 12:50.395
didn't think was right, instead of telling me not 
to do it, She'd say, sleep on it and call me

12:50.932 --> 12:53.196
tomorrow. Well, by tomorrow, it was okay. So I 
think that was the only thing I remember was, you

12:57.002 --> 13:05.797
know, everything works out for the best, and if 
you're down, just sleep on it. It'll look better

13:05.938 --> 13:07.039
tomorrow. And you got assigned to what outfit? A3 
vet. John Kieschnick was my company commander.

13:12.469 --> 13:13.851
Did it have a nickname? Well, you asked that in the 
paperwork, and I've looked, and if it did, I don't

13:14.675 --> 13:21.022
recall. The only thing I recall about it was like 
September the 15th or 16th. We started school in

13:26.368 --> 13:30.272
September back then, which I think is wonderful. 
The thought of school, I never liked school.

13:33.655 --> 13:39.101
Matter of fact, when I went to kindergarten at 
River Oaks Elementary, my mother took me. We

13:39.522 --> 13:40.783
walked to school. And I beat her home the first day 
of school. And I announced when she came back, I was

13:44.300 --> 13:49.047
sitting on the back steps, that I didn't like 
school. And the thought of starting in August

13:50.169 --> 13:53.514
would have just killed me. But we started back then 
in mid-September. And John Kieschnick, they'd

13:56.698 --> 14:02.487
cut our hair off, and we were in our PT gear, our 
physical training gear. And we were on our seats.

14:08.095 --> 14:10.939
And there was, in my... In A3 Vets, there was about 
60 of us, as I recall. It could have been 40, but I've

14:15.557 --> 14:21.365
always thought there was about 60 fish in A3. And 
our knees are under our chins, and we've got our

14:21.405 --> 14:25.952
arms around our knees. John Kieschnick's got his 
boots on, and he's marching back and forth down the

14:26.633 --> 14:32.601
hall. And he said, okay, fish, look to your left, 
look to your right. Those guys are going to be

14:35.865 --> 14:38.008
missing soon. And I think out of the... 50 or 60 of 
us, nine graduated from A&M. And it always struck

14:45.854 --> 15:04.062
me that A&M, and when I would get lieutenants from 
A&M in the military, I'd always have to caution

14:45.854 --> 15:04.062
them that the mission is not to run off people in the 
Army, the mission is to keep people. And so, you

15:04.082 --> 15:10.592
know, it always struck me that at least that A3 
company prided itself with my fish roommate,

15:11.315 --> 15:15.359
about, it was Fish Lillard. I don't know what his 
first name was. He was from Beaumont. And he lasted

15:18.962 --> 15:20.484
about three weeks. And one weekend, he never came 
back. And his folks came back and got his stuff. But

15:28.332 --> 15:30.253
I never saw Fish Lillard again. But they were so 
hard on him because he was kind of meek and mild. And

15:35.599 --> 15:38.722
that was not what they wanted in A3. Mm-hmm. And so 
it was, you know, that was kind of the entrance. And

15:46.291 --> 15:50.177
I was a little negative at the end of that meeting, 
the way it went. But that night, we went to G.

15:51.399 --> 15:54.043
Raleigh White. We marched to G. Raleigh White. It 
was my first night on campus, I think. And we were

16:00.432 --> 16:03.656
all marched in there, and we were sat down. And the 
upperclassmen, and I'm not sure if they were the

16:08.099 --> 16:16.028
sophomores and juniors, but the upperclassmen 
were standing in the aisles and we were sitting in

16:08.099 --> 16:16.028
the bleachers looking down at the basketball 
court. And General Earl Rudder came out and he got a

16:16.829 --> 16:33.567
microphone and he had this, as I remember, this 
billowing voice and he welcomed us and he told us

16:16.829 --> 16:33.567
some of the history of A&M and And he talked a little 
bit about what A&M had done, as far as A&M cadets had

16:34.441 --> 16:41.613
done in World War II. And then he says, and I need to 
tell you a story because some of you are going to

16:42.714 --> 16:47.082
want to quit. And you need to know that Aggies 
aren't quitters. And he said, I was given the

16:55.055 --> 17:00.904
mission as a young lieutenant colonel to take 
Pointe du Hoc. He says, I know none of you have ever

17:01.981 --> 17:13.111
been there, and I doubt if any of you know where it 
is, but it's in France, and it's just off the

17:01.981 --> 17:13.111
Normandy beaches to the right of Normandy 
beaches. He said there was some German, and I'll

17:13.171 --> 17:18.756
never forget this. I mean, I was mesmerized. I'm 
looking down at this guy, and he says there was some

17:19.998 --> 17:31.228
German field guns that could range the Allied 
shipping, and it was in fortified positions.

17:32.035 --> 18:00.692
concrete reinforced bunkers and they allied 
planes for months in preparing the battlefield

17:32.035 --> 18:00.692
had bombed Pointe du Hoc but the Germans to make 
sure that we knew that it was bombing was a failure

17:32.035 --> 18:00.692
every once while we just run one of those big uh 
coastal artillery pieces out of the end of the

17:32.035 --> 18:00.692
bunker and shoot out into the Atlantic to tell us 
that they were still fine. So my rangers, the

18:04.174 --> 18:10.661
second ranger battalion that I commanded was 
given the mission to take it. And he said, when I

18:10.821 --> 18:19.871
looked at the maps, the grid lines stacked on top of 
one another at the point where the ocean and the

18:10.821 --> 18:19.871
land met. And I know you don't know anything about 
military maps, but that meant it was a cliff. And so

18:26.398 --> 18:30.342
we began to train in England on cliff climbing. and 
he said the Rangers were a tough bunch and had gone

18:30.929 --> 18:53.273
through all kind of special training, but then we 
began, you know, how to get up this cliff, and we

18:30.929 --> 18:53.273
knew that they would be, for sure, rolling rocks 
down on us and probably shooting with the small

18:30.929 --> 18:53.273
arms right down on us, so we were going to have to do 
this at night. So the training in England

18:54.214 --> 18:59.299
progressed from day... cliff climbing, and we 
found a suitable place to night cliff climbing. I

19:05.897 --> 19:09.001
had people rolling rocks down on the soldiers. I 
mean, he went through all this, and I was

19:09.121 --> 19:11.424
mesmerized. Well, as he's telling the story, a 
Texas thunderstorm begins to materialize, and it

19:11.484 --> 19:26.923
starts lightning, and you can hear the thunder, 
and then it would lightning, and then it would be

19:11.484 --> 19:26.923
pitch dark. And one of the bolts obviously hit a 
critical point on campus. And all the lights in G.

19:34.275 --> 19:36.538
Raleigh went out. All the electricity went out. 
And it was pitch dark, except when it was

19:38.220 --> 19:43.525
lightning. And there would be light, and there 
would be pitch dark, and the thunder, and the

19:43.585 --> 19:48.610
tremendous bolts. And General Rutter never 
stopped talking. The microphone went out. But

19:56.688 --> 20:06.725
there was an acoustic, pretty good acoustics 
there, and his billowing voice just came from that

19:56.688 --> 20:06.725
basketball floor. He was marching back and forth 
and telling us about climbing up and getting shot

20:07.206 --> 20:15.901
at and everything and what his rangers were doing. 
And then the lightning would hit, and you'd see him

20:16.923 --> 20:21.531
down there, and then it would be pitch dark. And 
about the time, you know, the crescendo of his

20:22.118 --> 20:34.833
speech and the crescendo of the lightning and the 
thunder is there and he's ending his speech, all

20:22.118 --> 20:34.833
the electricity comes back on and gee raleigh. He 
ends his presentation and I remember

20:35.553 --> 20:45.645
whoever was next to me, I said to him, this guy's 
really good. And I remember thinking, I wonder if

20:46.165 --> 20:50.289
he does this every September like this. But any 
time from then on, I felt like quitting A&M, the

20:51.450 --> 21:05.862
thought would quickly pass because I was afraid I 
might have to go see General Rutter or something.

21:06.282 --> 21:10.506
And so I never really had serious thoughts of 
quitting A&M at all. And I'll never forget that,

21:10.826 --> 21:15.210
and I've told that story many a time. All right, 
describe how your outfit was put together in the

21:15.680 --> 21:23.287
dorm. You're in what dorm? 17, which is over by the 
Agriculture Extension Service Building. But I

21:30.474 --> 21:33.957
think it has a name now, but it used to be a number, 
17. And we were at the end of the quad from Sabisa,

21:34.017 --> 21:40.743
and then we had the longest way to march to Sabisa. 
And did you all have the whole dorm? Well, you know,

21:44.806 --> 21:46.790
I don't know that. I was on the first floor, and I 
know we had the whole first floor, and that was

21:46.990 --> 21:53.622
enough for me. Describe your room, what was in it, 
and so forth. Well, it was austere because

21:58.430 --> 22:09.750
anything you had in it had to be ready for 
inspection, so nobody in their right mind had

21:58.430 --> 22:09.750
extra stuff in this room because if you did, you had 
to have it cleaned and everything. And the only

22:10.338 --> 22:21.833
thing that I guess I ever really got in trouble for 
was

22:10.338 --> 22:21.833
I loved peanut butter sandwiches. And I loved them 
at midnight and 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning or

22:22.473 --> 22:26.599
whatever. And underneath the sink where the 
plumbing was, there was a metal plate with four

22:27.760 --> 22:34.429
screws. And that's where I kept my bread and my 
peanut butter. And then one day, one of the

22:39.481 --> 22:46.629
inspections, they noticed the paint, you know, 
from the screw was chipped. And so they took the

22:46.889 --> 22:50.733
plate off, and there was my peanut butter and my 
bread. But the room was, you know, it had two

22:53.376 --> 22:57.080
closets. It had bunk beds and one window and a 
radiator and had, you know, just blinds,

22:57.220 --> 23:08.492
Venetian-type blinds. And fish weren't allowed 
any posters or anything. And you each had a desk

23:14.506 --> 23:24.149
right by the

23:14.506 --> 23:24.149
radiator there that just faced out. And I think 
there was one dresser that you shared. After your

23:28.064 --> 23:34.593
first fish old lady dropped out of school, did they 
move somebody else in? Billy Provine from

23:34.814 --> 23:36.756
Alexandria, Louisiana. And he and I are past 
friends today. And Billy, I was raised as a hunter

23:39.801 --> 23:45.529
and a fisherman and a natural woodsman. And Billy 
Provine was five times the hunter and fisherman.

23:50.376 --> 23:51.718
He was from Alexandria. And we kind of supported 
ourselves by frogging in through the years we

23:56.920 --> 24:14.997
would and we would sell the bullfrogs in the season 
to the local restaurants and we we would frog all

23:56.920 --> 24:14.997
over you know the farms on the other side of the 
railroad tracks we knew every little slew and

23:56.920 --> 24:14.997
every little pond and we had our frog gigs and And he 
had his... Y'all started that as freshmen? Yeah,

24:20.689 --> 24:26.394
we just started... We were both outdoorsmen, and 
that's what we liked. So you gigged them and

24:27.075 --> 24:30.618
dressed them? Right. And there were several 
little restaurants in Bryan. Do you remember what

24:34.041 --> 24:36.202
the price was you were able to sell them for? We sold 
them in a bag, and it was kind of, I think, about a

24:36.262 --> 24:40.406
pound. And so you used... I don't recall the money, 
but it was... It was certainly spending money for

24:45.976 --> 24:47.738
us. I mean, it was just a few dollars, I'm sure. What 
was the routine at night in your dorm? Well, to the

24:56.309 --> 25:11.308
credit of the Corps, the Corps was, at least A3 
being a vet company, a pre-vet company, and the

24:56.309 --> 25:11.308
juniors and seniors were in vet school, that they 
were pretty disciplined about us studying and And

25:11.643 --> 25:17.271
so there was a call to quarters between a certain 
time and a certain time. And I'll say it's like 1930

25:17.291 --> 25:24.902
to 2130 or something that you had to be at your desk 
with your elbows on your desk studying. I mean,

25:25.903 --> 25:28.227
that was reading and studying and writing. And 
that was for like three hours. And the good news

25:30.190 --> 25:33.574
about that was you couldn't be harassed. No 
upperclassmen could come in there and harass you.

25:38.081 --> 25:41.025
The only place you could go outside your room was a 
latrine. And so it was a focused study time. Now,

25:48.325 --> 25:48.866
let's see. Now, G7, a year or two later, John Sharp 
and Rick Perry were in a pre-vet company. Did you

25:57.895 --> 25:59.597
overlap with them? Not that I know of, no. Because 
they were in the same outfit. Yeah. I went, you

26:07.585 --> 26:10.708
know, 3rd Brigade, at the end of my fish year, 1963, 
at the end of 64,

26:11.633 --> 26:19.161
spring of 64, the Corps went voluntary. And so the 
next year when we came back, the Corps was much

26:20.262 --> 26:23.706
smaller. And they had done away with the 3rd 
Brigade. And so we moved, I was a sophomore in B-1

26:27.190 --> 26:32.676
vets. And that was in the New Dorm area. And Duncan 
was our mess hall. And I know the dorm, but I don't

26:38.582 --> 26:41.185
recall the number. but I know where it was. And so 
then I was a B1 vet. But back that fish year, after

26:47.369 --> 26:54.798
1030, there could be some harassment. What kind of 
things went on in your life? Well, we only had one,

26:57.041 --> 27:00.465
and I learned a lot about leadership. Because we 
had...

27:05.492 --> 27:07.434
I figured out right quick this was a game. And... 
And so I kind of approached it as a game and never

27:10.510 --> 27:18.419
really took any of this very seriously, any of this 
harassment. There were pissheads who had to

27:18.439 --> 27:23.265
harass who didn't like to do it. And you figured 
those out. They were play acting. They were

27:26.789 --> 27:29.812
hollering and whatever, and they were not 
serious. And it was just, it was their mission.

27:32.015 --> 27:32.936
They had to do that. And at the same time, we're 
doing some coaching and teaching along the way,

27:33.777 --> 27:39.083
and you kind of gained... some admiration and 
respect for those guys. Gosney, there was several

27:44.313 --> 27:47.657
of them that I admired. But there was one, his name 
was Bill Bamberg from Buffalo, New York, and he

27:48.138 --> 27:53.866
busted out as a sophomore. But he was from north of 
Dallas, and he acted like a Yankee, and he thought

27:55.168 --> 28:05.542
like a Yankee, and he thought all that 
upperclassman stuff was real serious. And he took

28:06.223 --> 28:08.867
it serious, and... He just, you know, I used to feel 
sorry for him because he really thought that he

28:10.433 --> 28:22.303
was, you know, scaring us and it was all I could do 
not to laugh in his face, you know. And I wasn't

28:23.084 --> 28:31.411
surprised when he didn't come back because he just 
didn't fit with the other guys. So when I got, so I

28:31.951 --> 28:40.018
figured out when I was going to be an 
upperclassman, I was going to be one of those guys

28:31.951 --> 28:40.018
that focused on Coaching and teaching and not 
harassing, not hollering. As a military officer,

28:47.389 --> 28:53.159
I never hollered at troops because they're not 
going to listen to that. Because I learned right

28:53.479 --> 28:56.003
quick as a fish. And I learned it with Texas 
football. I had some coaches that hollered and

28:58.628 --> 29:01.332
some coaches that taught. And the ones that taught 
and coached and mentored, you listened and you

29:01.885 --> 29:08.131
learned from. And the hollers, you kind of wrote 
them off. And it was the same thing in my... So there

29:14.258 --> 29:17.361
was some hollering going on, but it never... I 
don't ever... And I've looked at my journals. I

29:20.865 --> 29:21.866
never remember... I never wrote down being mad or 
being upset or... And I just... I remember...

29:32.277 --> 29:54.943
having to not laugh though because that didn't 
make that didn't help you you did a lot of push-ups

29:32.277 --> 29:54.943
if you laughed and and thank goodness i was had a 
strong enough body because i did do a lot of

29:32.277 --> 29:54.943
push-ups and that was about the most serious thing 
that happened and and but i'd done a lot of push-ups

29:32.277 --> 29:54.943
in football so i that was not anything that you know 
now did they use the paddle in your outfit No, I

29:55.396 --> 29:57.398
don't remember the paddle. Maybe they did, but I 
don't remember that. What I remember, the thing

30:00.422 --> 30:13.837
that I remember that I didn't like was when you 
leaned against the wall and they ran the clothes

30:00.422 --> 30:13.837
hanger down and they hit that clothes hanger 
between your fanny and the wall. Now that hurt. And

30:17.281 --> 30:23.108
the more you pressed against the wall, the more 
they made you put your feet out and the more weight

30:17.281 --> 30:23.108
you put against the wall, the harder they had to get 
that clothes hanger down. And so I don't remember a

30:28.987 --> 30:31.011
paddle at all. Was that a punishment device? Oh, it 
was kind of a rites of passage. I don't remember as

30:38.746 --> 30:44.337
punishment as much as you kind of just... You know, 
we knew that was going to happen every night. And it

30:47.792 --> 30:49.073
left a pink fanny? Yeah, oh, I'm sure it did. I mean, 
I never looked, but I remembered saying, because

30:50.555 --> 31:06.289
I, you know, they had paddles in high school and 
junior high school, and, you know, I'd been, I had

30:50.555 --> 31:06.289
my rounds there, and I remember that the paddle 
didn't hurt at all compared to this clothes hanger

30:50.555 --> 31:06.289
going. I said, whoever came up with that, you know, 
was, you know, really was out to impress you. All

31:14.067 --> 31:22.039
right, now, academically, do you remember going 
through registration your first semester, or

31:14.067 --> 31:22.039
were your courses decided by? No, matter of fact, 
registration was in Duncan.
