00:11.067 --> 00:16.034
This is an interview with Bob McPherson, who is the 
director of planning for the state of Texas. The

00:16.855 --> 00:23.724
interview was conducted by Kent McLemore on the 
1st of May, 1984, in Mr. McPherson's office in

00:16.855 --> 00:23.724
Austin.

00:28.631 --> 00:34.138
My first question is, what do you feel the state's 
role in planning is, both present and

00:28.631 --> 00:34.138
historically? Okay, first of all, you understand 
there's a statutory requirement that makes the

00:35.198 --> 00:41.625
governor the chief planning officer of the state. 
So in that specific statute, which we can dig out

00:41.705 --> 00:49.774
the citation for, the responsibility is very 
clearly there. There are a number of other pieces

00:50.274 --> 01:02.687
of legislation where the governor's office is 
assigned oversight or planning or some kind of

00:50.274 --> 01:02.687
management responsibilities. So there is a 
statutory base Beyond that, I guess in terms of a

01:06.282 --> 01:11.189
personal, if that's what we want to deal with. 
That's fine, yes. It seems to me that in terms of the

01:14.574 --> 01:31.277
current structure of state government, the 
governor's office is in a role of encouraging and

01:14.574 --> 01:31.277
facilitating planning, whether you're talking 
about long-range planning or operational

01:14.574 --> 01:31.277
planning.

01:33.400 --> 01:48.964
the governor's office as structured is probably 
not going to support within the office a staff

01:33.400 --> 01:48.964
which would be required to do long-range planning 
or very much operational planning. Where we are

01:50.867 --> 02:01.483
now, it seems to me that there's no question about 
the need for some long-range planning and some

01:50.867 --> 02:01.483
planning in policy areas that certainly reaches 
or stretches beyond the existing state agency

02:01.649 --> 02:11.599
boundaries, you need a planning capability above 
those state agencies that's not currently

02:01.649 --> 02:11.599
present. If you look over at the Legislative 
Budget Board, you find an organization there,

02:11.819 --> 02:28.956
which is in essence a creature of the legislature, 
that has the responsibility for budgeting and

02:11.819 --> 02:28.956
evaluation, but it does not have a planning 
responsibility. You look over in the governor's

02:29.527 --> 02:38.622
office, and you think of the governor's office as 
the office of the chief executive and kind of the

02:29.527 --> 02:38.622
management office of state government. And you 
find the title here, or the responsibility here,

02:39.744 --> 02:44.492
but you don't find the staff. So the function, the 
planning function, is really not performed here,

02:44.513 --> 02:52.446
or a planning function above the state agency's. 
So you've got kind of a planning coordination

02:52.730 --> 03:02.142
function inside the governor's office, 
coordinating the planning efforts in the

02:52.730 --> 03:02.142
independent agencies. My own perception, 
personally, is that that's a missing element in

03:02.162 --> 03:08.971
state government. Either there should be some 
mechanism above the state agencies to do

03:08.991 --> 03:19.564
long-range planning, whether that be a function 
of the Legislative Budget Board, Would it be a

03:19.915 --> 03:26.181
function assigned to the governor's office or to 
some other entity? You should budget, and you

03:26.201 --> 03:33.368
should evaluate, and you should manage 
day-to-day programs within the context of a plan.

03:33.928 --> 03:42.076
You ought to have a yardstick there that says by the 
year 2000, by the year 2010, by 1990, this is where

03:33.928 --> 03:42.076
Texas ought to be. Let's take a given policy area 
like human resources or health. What you do is

03:50.459 --> 04:05.321
you've got to recognize that in state government, 
there are a number of agencies who have some part of

03:50.459 --> 04:05.321
the responsibility for the day-to-day operation 
or implementation of health programs. We need

04:05.341 --> 04:18.981
something above those agencies that looks at 
health policy and human services policy and sets a

04:05.341 --> 04:18.981
long-range direction and say, in Texas, this is 
where we want to be in terms of providing these

04:05.341 --> 04:18.981
kinds of services to the population. then more or 
less with that direction set, the legislature can

04:20.547 --> 04:35.885
appropriate, the state agencies can administer 
with a sense of direction that in this policy area,

04:20.547 --> 04:35.885
this is what we're trying to accomplish. And the 
idea is that you can begin to not be so concerned

04:36.686 --> 04:46.858
about defining problems or proposing solutions 
that are within the... the jurisdictions or the

04:47.463 --> 04:51.948
turf, if you will, of a given state agency. Does 
that make sense? Yes. Do you understand what I'm

04:53.129 --> 04:54.270
saying? Yes. And that's a piece that's missing. 
And this is a personal perspective rather than the

04:56.533 --> 05:02.779
office of the governor speaking, and it has to be 
couched in those terms. That's fine. That that is a

05:03.500 --> 05:11.749
piece that we need desperately, that we do not 
have, Currently, we're trying to accomplish that

05:13.045 --> 05:17.211
by the creation. Either the governor through an 
executive order or the legislature through

05:17.351 --> 05:27.907
statute has created a number of interagency 
councils or task forces. And these tend to be

05:28.427 --> 05:34.657
entities that sit above the state agencies and 
have some responsibilities. And I think there's a

05:35.878 --> 05:39.944
potential there to do some long-range planning 
with those groups. Hopefully that will be used by

05:42.020 --> 05:46.486
the legislature in the appropriations process. 
But that's more of a wish than a statement of a

05:46.506 --> 05:51.212
reality. In absence of any other formal 
mechanism, I don't know how you're going to do it,

05:53.154 --> 06:01.685
unless the LBB would pick up the long-range 
planning responsibility. And if the governor's

06:01.865 --> 06:07.572
office doesn't assume it in-house, inside, then 
we've got

06:17.238 --> 06:25.189
It was enacted by Senate Bill 711, which has in its 
charge some responsibility for long-range

06:17.238 --> 06:25.189
planning. We've got, sometimes it's under 
federal law, where the law requires, one most

06:26.231 --> 06:37.527
recent one is under the Job Training Partnership 
Act. The federal law mandates a state job training

06:37.607 --> 06:45.118
coordinating council, and the requirements 
there are to look between or among the various

06:45.402 --> 06:53.032
state agencies providing job training for 
unemployed, low-income folks. So there's at

06:53.612 --> 06:59.660
least the nucleus of a group in the job training and 
employment area. We've got another one over here

06:59.820 --> 07:04.266
in the health and human services area, and I could 
name some others. So we're beginning to get those

07:04.947 --> 07:10.113
interagency mechanisms there to do that kind of 
planning. Creation of your artistic, where does

07:10.894 --> 07:14.599
the Texas 2000 program come in? Well, the Texas 
2000 project was an initiative of the prior

07:15.524 --> 07:21.312
administration. And that was an initiative which 
was not finalized in the sense of I think the people

07:23.194 --> 07:38.815
who were involved with 2000 envisioned several 
steps that they were not able to complete because

07:23.194 --> 07:38.815
of the changes in administration. But as an 
approach to identifying what some of the major

07:40.178 --> 07:51.692
issues were and to gathering and formatting 
information on problems, I think it was a positive

07:40.178 --> 07:51.692
first step. It did not get into long-range 
planning specifically and certainly not into

07:52.393 --> 08:02.065
implementation strategies. It's one thing to say 
this is where we want to be by the year 2000. The

08:06.250 --> 08:15.083
second part of that is to generate some options and 
come up with what you'd call the optimum strategy

08:06.250 --> 08:15.083
for getting us there. What are the five steps that 
it takes to get us from 1980 to 2000, or from 1990 to

08:15.143 --> 08:21.472
2010? And that was not there. I think the people who 
were involved in that were intelligent enough to

08:24.516 --> 08:35.532
know that those were pieces yet to be developed, 
but it didn't get there. The products that I have

08:36.187 --> 08:48.762
seen are those relating to position papers and the 
data gathering, identifying some of the major

08:36.187 --> 08:48.762
areas, such as water, what it was going to do about 
water.

08:51.905 --> 08:59.995
But beyond problem identification, some 
measurement, that's about where 2000 got. I know

09:01.557 --> 09:06.042
you've been in state government for quite some 
time, or around state government for quite some

09:01.557 --> 09:06.042
time. Historically, what has been the state's 
role related to planning? From my research, I've

09:09.803 --> 09:17.514
dug up that really prior to 1960, the state hadn't 
taken an interest in comprehensive planning.

09:17.534 --> 09:29.230
Well, I think most of the planning, really until 
the late 60s, most of the planning that was done in

09:17.534 --> 09:29.230
state government was done in the agencies. And I 
don't think the governor's office played a major

09:30.953 --> 09:34.678
role in that at all. the 1960s began to change 
things because the Great Society programs of the

09:35.738 --> 09:45.951
Lyndon Johnson era. Just the sheer increase, if 
you look at any statistics on what was happening to

09:47.613 --> 10:03.012
federal grants and aid, grants and aid to the 
states in any number of policy areas, and you look

09:47.613 --> 10:03.012
back of 1960 or even the mid-60s, not very much was 
happening. in terms of volume, in terms of

10:04.173 --> 10:08.518
dollars, as a percent of total dollars measured. 
And then all of a sudden, in the mid-'60s, I guess

10:08.618 --> 10:26.177
for a number of different reasons, grants and aid 
jumped significantly in terms of federal grants

10:08.618 --> 10:26.177
either directly to the states or to programs 
within the state. In other words, in some cases,

10:26.197 --> 10:30.482
these grants went around state government, went 
directly into local governments. But the sheer

10:30.502 --> 10:33.285
magnitude of the flow forced states to begin to 
think about planning seriously.

10:41.291 --> 10:48.810
State agencies prior to that time largely been 
reactive to the direction given by the state

10:41.291 --> 10:48.810
legislature. They then fell into a position of 
relating to the legislature but also having

10:50.174 --> 10:59.388
available to them, if they'd fill out a grant 
application, a significant amount of federal

10:50.174 --> 10:59.388
money. And then this began to complicate their 
lives in many ways because the federal money

10:59.609 --> 11:06.259
brought requirements with it. Much of that money 
was targeted, and it almost demanded some

11:06.998 --> 11:12.166
additional planning. This was linked to regional 
councils, because they were being formed,

11:12.747 --> 11:16.293
weren't they, about this time? Well, they were 
formed in the late 60s, I think. 67? 66 was the first

11:18.857 --> 11:22.363
one that I know of. Okay. The whole regionalism 
thing, I think, came from a recognition that The

11:34.319 --> 11:51.714
amount of money that was available, the kinds of 
problems we were facing demanded something other

11:34.319 --> 11:51.714
than a county by county or a city by city plan or 
problem identification plan and solution or

11:34.319 --> 11:51.714
strategy for how we're going to solve the problem. 
I think we began to recognize that the problems

11:54.603 --> 11:58.990
were pervasive and did not respect political 
jurisdictions. The problem didn't stop at the

11:59.611 --> 12:01.755
county line. I mean, an issue of water or an issue of 
unemployment, for that matter. We sensed that a

12:07.384 --> 12:19.243
lot of the better jobs tended to move out into the 
non-urban areas or out of the edge of the cities,

12:07.384 --> 12:19.243
and yet many of the unemployed people were in the 
central city. if you crossed a county line, the job

12:19.797 --> 12:25.003
may be over here, the training institution over 
here. So the whole issue was brought to our

12:25.263 --> 12:38.437
attention, I think, rather vividly that we had to 
think about something broader than just a given

12:25.263 --> 12:38.437
program area or a given political jurisdiction. 
Now something happened in there. In the mid-60s, a

12:39.619 --> 12:42.382
lot of that money came categorically. And then in 
the late 60s and early 70s, we began to think about

12:43.223 --> 12:48.268
all of the related programs that had been created 
by the grants and aid program, and how that once

12:48.552 --> 13:00.403
they got into the city of Dallas or the city of 
Houston, that the left hand didn't know what the

12:48.552 --> 13:00.403
right hand was doing. So there was a big move from 
the late 60s and early 70s, particularly during

13:00.483 --> 13:11.073
the Nixon administration, of modified block 
grants and block grants, which meant the money

13:00.483 --> 13:11.073
still came from the feds. But they knocked out some 
of the categorical restrictions and began to give

13:12.094 --> 13:18.019
you block grants. And there were even 
encouragements in there to do things on a

13:18.235 --> 13:23.621
multi-jurisdictional basis. Several pieces of 
that legislation encouraged consortia

13:24.782 --> 13:31.350
arrangements, cities and counties joining 
together to do things. So I think a lot of that

13:31.930 --> 13:46.246
regionalism, the support for it, came from the 
fact that the federal funding flow changed from a

13:31.930 --> 13:46.246
categorical perspective of the 60s to a block 
grant perspective in the late 60s and early 70s.

13:47.147 --> 13:47.668
And then... There was one other. In a state like 
Texas, I think we began to recognize, in the same

13:51.232 --> 14:00.961
sense that the feds said, everything's not alike 
all over the country. In other words, we can't sit

14:00.981 --> 14:05.605
in Washington and design specific programs for 
Houston. In Austin, we became more and more aware

14:06.446 --> 14:11.651
of the differences in Texas. We talked about them a 
long time, about Texas could be easily divided

14:11.711 --> 14:17.436
into five other states or more. Somewhere in the 
late 60s and early 70s, I think we really decided to

14:18.023 --> 14:26.476
make an investment in the fact that there are a lot 
of differences. And we came up with the 24

14:26.536 --> 14:38.634
sub-state planning regions and the idea of 
councils of government as aggregations of local

14:26.536 --> 14:38.634
elected officials to get together to propose 
solutions to problems. Another part of this was a

14:38.654 --> 14:40.977
recognition that the closer people are to the 
problem, the more likely they are to come up with a

14:41.699 --> 14:48.287
solution that can be implemented in that local 
area. And I didn't say the best solution. I said a

14:50.429 --> 14:56.617
solution that is more likely to be acceptable or to 
be implemented in that local area. So I think for

14:56.637 --> 14:59.600
all those reasons, you've got to move toward 
reasonableness. And anything we do right now, we

15:00.361 --> 15:03.505
try to give I'm strong believer that this isn't 
well the fact is this is not Rhode Island if we were

15:03.974 --> 15:31.720
in Rhode Island I wouldn't support regionalism 
because I don't have that much divergence or

15:03.974 --> 15:31.720
difference diversity might be a better word but 
I've got Texas and I've got 24 Rhode Islands if you

15:03.974 --> 15:31.720
will I've got I like the fact that we think 
regionally in Texas I think it's ridiculous not to

15:03.974 --> 15:31.720
well uh In fact, we've been discussing in our 
classes about the diversity of Texas. It's very

15:36.326 --> 15:37.448
much diversified. This is brought home to us in 
some simple things, as Lubbock's freezing while

15:37.468 --> 15:43.416
Brownsville's making such things. Well, based on 
this diversity in the regional idea, what is

15:43.897 --> 15:49.825
Governor White's attitude about all this? Where 
does he plan to go with planning in Texas in such a

15:50.505 --> 15:54.371
diversified state? Well, I think he'll see us 
continue to support regionalism.

16:02.176 --> 16:12.951
At the same time, I don't think that necessarily 
means that councils of government will continue

16:02.176 --> 16:12.951
to have the same functions in the same policy areas 
they've always had before. I think we'll rely on

16:14.994 --> 16:21.703
the state, federal, local construct and continue 
to support that. What you'll see in the White

16:21.987 --> 16:29.476
administration is, had we done the Texas 2000 
study, we might have looked at some other issues

16:21.987 --> 16:29.476
first. We might have looked at human resources 
rather than natural resources. If you look at some

16:33.200 --> 16:42.791
of the first work that was done by the 2000 group, I 
think you'll see it concentrated in the natural

16:33.200 --> 16:42.791
resources area. If I'd have had anything to do 
about it, we'd have started with people problems

16:42.811 --> 16:46.235
first. Not that the others aren't important. So I 
think it's not that we will either

16:50.658 --> 17:02.093
propose to do away with regionalism. I would not 
advocate that in any way. What we expect the

17:05.938 --> 17:13.628
regional councils to do and the kinds of areas that 
we might emphasize would be different. would be

17:14.131 --> 17:16.074
more on the human resources side. You've already 
seen in the White administration a very strong

17:16.535 --> 17:25.127
push in education, job training, economic 
development. Now, we recognize that economic

17:27.050 --> 17:42.653
development's got many facets to it, and that one 
of our major problems in any kind of economic

17:27.050 --> 17:42.653
development initiative all tie back to the 
natural resources available and to the social

17:27.050 --> 17:42.653
infrastructure. the airports, the highways, the 
level of any number of ingredients that are

17:43.223 --> 17:53.393
essential to quality of schools. It really can be, 
in some ways, an infrastructure issue. Because a

17:58.579 --> 18:10.851
private firm looking at Texas, one of the first 
questions would be, does this area have an airport

17:58.579 --> 18:10.851
that will take care of my jet? Second question will 
relate to the quality of life. That'll get into

18:14.213 --> 18:18.658
parks and schools and those kinds of issues. Then 
the availability of land, the availability of a

18:19.019 --> 18:25.006
skilled workforce. All those factors are 
important. So it all ties together just in a little

18:27.529 --> 18:32.755
different way and where you would start. Sarah, 
planning having to take on a different form. We've

18:35.999 --> 18:38.782
been a primarily agricultural state, primarily 
rural. We're becoming more urban, suburban. more

18:41.543 --> 18:45.007
manufacturing-oriented, does that affect our 
planning? In my mind, it doesn't affect the

18:45.928 --> 18:55.039
basic steps in the planning process. They're the 
science. What it means is that the problems are

18:57.122 --> 19:00.726
different. If you look out at needs of the 
population, because the fact the population is

19:00.906 --> 19:09.897
increasing rapidly, because the population mix, 
which people overlook sometimes, is changing

19:10.028 --> 19:15.576
significantly. I think we're going to identify 
different kinds of problems to be addressed. But

19:21.944 --> 19:26.891
I'm a strong believer in the way to address those 
problems doesn't change that much.

19:29.795 --> 19:37.065
The common sense of the planning process, whether 
you're dealing with Standard Oil of Indiana and

19:29.795 --> 19:37.065
their plans for the North Sea, or the state of Texas 
and how it might go about an economic development

19:37.703 --> 19:49.980
strategy for the lower Rio Grande, the approach to 
planning is much the same, strategic planning

19:37.703 --> 19:49.980
particularly. Same kind of steps. Same kind of 
steps. I realize you have a meeting at 3.30. But

19:56.510 --> 19:59.193
I've got another minute if you want to raise 
another question.

20:01.997 --> 20:03.880
I guess I just want to reiterate for the purpose of 
the table for the book, in what direction do you

20:04.501 --> 20:12.192
think state planning should go from this point in 
Kansas summation? Where should we go as a state

20:12.212 --> 20:16.098
based on what we've done in the past? Well, let me 
put it in a little bit even broader context. I think

20:22.847 --> 20:33.242
there's a very strong management responsibility 
in terms of the number of public dollars that we are

20:22.847 --> 20:33.242
responsible for the effective and efficient 
implementation of. There's a planning role here

20:38.772 --> 20:41.656
that is yet to evolve. And I'm hopeful that we will 
continue to give attention to it. And the piece

20:47.584 --> 20:53.693
that I think is missing, which I think is 
repetitive in what I've said earlier, is a

20:47.584 --> 20:53.693
strategic planning piece. I think operational 
planning is done within the agencies. I think

20:58.720 --> 21:05.727
agencies are willing to carry out public policy 
directives coming from the legislature. I don't

21:05.747 --> 21:15.336
think there is a framework at this point within 
which the legislature makes its incremental

21:05.747 --> 21:15.336
program and budget decisions. And I think that's a 
piece that's missing. Now, as long as I have

21:17.198 --> 21:28.609
anything to do with it, I will push toward that 
broader, where do we want to be at some point in the

21:17.198 --> 21:28.609
future? And what kind of steps do we take now to get 
there? So one of the keys is intergovernmental

21:32.049 --> 21:39.456
cooperation among the state agencies, State 
Highway Department, Texas Water Resources

21:32.049 --> 21:39.456
Board, and so forth and so on. In my mind, each of 
them has a lot of resources. And within their own

21:44.401 --> 21:52.429
agencies, I think they efficiently as possible 
manage those resources. I think they are denied

21:53.029 --> 21:56.993
the bigger picture. I think each of them has a 
perception of where we ought to go. I would propose

22:00.124 --> 22:15.663
to get them together and let's together agree on 
where the state ought to be out here, what the

22:00.124 --> 22:15.663
capacity ought to be, what the capability ought to 
be, what the systems ought to be, almost any aspect

22:00.124 --> 22:15.663
you can think of. I would take them through a 
process in which each of us involved in this thing

22:16.845 --> 22:26.997
makes our values and our philosophies explicit 
and says out of that, where is it that we want to be? I

22:27.584 --> 22:31.088
think it's a hell of a team building exercise in the 
first place. I think it does a lot to bring agencies

22:31.128 --> 22:36.293
together toward a common objective. But I think as 
long as we define those objectives, those goals,

22:36.313 --> 22:43.381
independent of each other, we lose something. I 
think there are definitely economies here for us

22:44.282 --> 22:49.267
to sit down together and say, this is where we want 
to be. Now, what part can my agency contribute to

22:49.327 --> 22:54.773
the implementation of that plan? not how do I fight 
to make sure my agency gets more money in the next

22:55.478 --> 22:59.382
session. So then it should be a function of the 
governor's office as? Governor's office can

23:02.925 --> 23:06.128
facilitate that and should be leading it. Should 
act as manager, as leader. Yes. The leadership,

23:09.491 --> 23:15.616
the focus for that kind of activity probably, 
that's a legitimate role for the governor. To do

23:15.957 --> 23:18.539
the plan in the governor's office is not. I see. But 
to coordinate would be? Yes. No question. Good.

23:23.474 --> 23:27.219
That about takes care of my questions because I had 
planned it for about 30 minutes. All right, all

23:27.380 --> 23:28.548
right. Sorry, I was a little...
