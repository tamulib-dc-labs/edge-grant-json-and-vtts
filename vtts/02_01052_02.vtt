WEBVTT

00:03.608 --> 00:10.076
Now where did you go after officer

00:03.608 --> 00:10.076
school? From, this unit was also there, well it was 
at Camp Wood. What, Leonard Wood? No. No? No, it

00:17.585 --> 00:19.768
was, I'm not sure what the other name was. It was 
just four or five miles outside of Fort Monmouth.

00:23.993 --> 00:24.995
Okay, I see. It was at the same place we went through 
our, was, I recall, what they called it, POM or

00:32.026 --> 00:52.912
something training, overseas training, where 
you crawl under the machine gun fire, you go

00:32.026 --> 00:52.912
through the gas drills and throw grenades and this 
sort of thing, fired on the rifle range and various

00:32.026 --> 00:52.912
things as this. Preparation for overseas 
movement is, I believe, what they called it. And

00:59.420 --> 01:01.122
from there, why? went to, as a unit on the train, a 
troop train to California and went overseas on the

01:02.823 --> 01:24.489
USS Merline, which was

01:02.823 --> 01:24.489
at one time a pleasure craft of the Matson line 
running from Frisco to Hawaii. And it was... What

01:24.509 --> 01:26.812
was this unit's designation? We went to New 
Guinea. No, no destination. What was it called? Do

01:33.467 --> 01:33.907
you remember? Did it have a number, et cetera? 
0964H, Casual Detachment, 0964H. And it was

01:40.396 --> 02:00.623
actually the entire detachment were made up of two 
headquarters teams, which was a company

01:40.396 --> 02:00.623
commander, a supply officer, a company clerk, and 
a first sergeant, and I don't remember whether

01:40.396 --> 02:00.623
they had a mess sergeant or not, but it was a team 
supposedly could go in and operate a company.

02:01.514 --> 02:03.177
There were two of these teams. There were ten of the 
radio teams that were called three position radio

02:03.237 --> 02:14.355
teams where you operate from one place, your 
receivers are remote site and transmitters are

02:03.237 --> 02:14.355
another remote site. These units each had two 
officers and about 20 men. The switchboard team

02:22.448 --> 02:28.197
were called a three position switchboard team 
which meant you had a place for three switchboard

02:28.902 --> 02:32.245
operators sitting side by side. We had a cable 
splicer, an installer repairman. In other words,

02:37.309 --> 02:48.339
this unit could not only set up and operate the 
switchboard, but all the connecting phones and

02:37.309 --> 02:48.339
trunks to other switchboards, this sort of 
capability. When did you sail? Do you remember

02:51.642 --> 02:54.784
what month and year you sailed? It was in October, 
about the 10th of October. It's 1943. And 44. 44,

03:00.186 --> 03:01.749
excuse me. They made the invasion of Lady, I think, 
while we were on the boat. And so you went to New

03:07.637 --> 03:08.819
Guinea. And we started at New Guinea. We were 
supposed to have gone into Australia and were

03:10.561 --> 03:14.147
running out of fresh water. And Brisbane was not 
deep enough harbor for them to take on fresh water.

03:20.396 --> 03:28.407
So we went to Milne Bay and from there on to

03:20.396 --> 03:28.407
Oro Bay, which is where we debarked and then oh a 
number of us had problems with the company

03:29.787 --> 03:51.537
commander and

03:29.787 --> 03:51.537
got transferred out as fast as we could and I went to 
a heavy construction company which was a full line

03:29.787 --> 03:51.537
type construction company up at Alanya. What was 
the designation of this unit? This unit was

03:53.820 --> 03:56.844
company C of the 52nd Signal Battalion. This was a a 
signal battalion that had been in, started out in

04:00.331 --> 04:04.896
Australia. It was broken down into, I believe 
there were two heavy construction companies and

04:05.697 --> 04:17.589
an operating company, radio, message center type 
set up, and a headquarters company. For roughly

04:19.971 --> 04:28.600
two weeks while I was there, the month that I was 
there at Helania, it was the only time I ever saw

04:19.971 --> 04:28.600
anything of our other than just the company we were 
sent as a separate company and later even split to

04:29.727 --> 04:45.843
separate platoons, company and different task 
force.

04:45.863 --> 04:47.705
You said you were there about a month? At Hylania 
about a month and then we went to Lady. From Lady uh

04:53.311 --> 04:57.675
oh we had just got an assignment to rebuild a line 
over what they call the Ormont corridor and these

04:58.364 --> 05:25.182
were changed and we were sent to Mindoro where we 
joined with the 41st division which had been come

04:58.364 --> 05:25.182
up all the way from Australia, New Guinea, Boonah, 
Finch Haven, a number of these places

05:26.866 --> 05:52.620
at the end of the war this Major Helles who was a 
signal officer over us as a separate unit I think

05:26.866 --> 05:52.620
the first first list of coming home with number of 
points he was on it he'd been there this long and it

05:26.866 --> 05:52.620
was a unit that had been through a lot but But at 
Mendora, this is where we split the company, and we

05:53.393 --> 06:02.708
went and split the cooks, split the company 
clerks. Of course, we had construction platoons

06:04.991 --> 06:21.257
that were already separated, and we went as a 
separate platoon then to Palawan in the

06:04.991 --> 06:21.257
Philippines with the 186th Regiment as a 
regimental combat team. I don't recall, spent

06:22.874 --> 06:42.038
probably three or four months there and later 
rejoined the company and the rest of the division

06:22.874 --> 06:42.038
down at Zamboanga where they had gone in as an 
invasion and the same type thing where ours was

06:22.874 --> 06:42.038
there at Palawan. I think they had probably more 
opposition down there. Were you all following the

06:48.346 --> 06:52.611
combat troops in to do your particular work? Yes, 
we were assigned in splitting the division.

06:57.488 --> 07:07.281
Signal Company, they didn't have enough 
personnel to accomplish their mission of

06:57.488 --> 07:07.281
telephone and what have you. And we went in, 
started off stringing field wire and what have

07:07.301 --> 07:11.847
you. And as soon as

07:12.828 --> 07:21.079
ours was over pretty quick, in close at least, This 
was at Port Princesa where we went in, but

07:21.278 --> 07:35.859
then we started some pole line construction

07:21.278 --> 07:35.859
for the various units. There were a number of 
aviation engineering battalions there

07:35.879 --> 07:42.789
building, rebuilding the runway. This seemed to 
have been a place where any time a plane was flying,

07:49.966 --> 08:01.018
back and forth, and I'm not sure from where to 
where, Lady or what have you, to the island south

07:49.966 --> 08:01.018
where they had come from and they had any bombs 
left. They dropped them here. So the engineers had

08:02.079 --> 08:06.744
a pretty rough time getting this rebuilt. Did you 
all come under any fire while you were doing here?

08:16.674 --> 08:17.475
Oh, not really. In other words, the area was fairly 
well cleared before y'all went in and laid lines?

08:24.794 --> 08:43.377
Well, there are some of our working and 
right-of-ways that may be standing there with a

08:24.794 --> 08:43.377
pair of pliers and see Jaffa and both of them was 
ready to bail out, but primarily it was a cleared

08:24.794 --> 08:43.377
area. We used to have a lone air raid, long plane 
making an air raid once in a while, this sort of

08:45.620 --> 08:54.891
thing, but not, not a concentrated effort. There, 
there were lots of, and I say lots, there were a

08:54.911 --> 09:10.108
number of individual Japanese soldiers and there 
were, they had a small penal group or prison for

09:11.287 --> 09:41.040
them where they would bring them in but this was an 
island that well

09:11.287 --> 09:41.040
I guess it's claim to fame was it had two penal 
colonies there that were still operating as penal

09:11.287 --> 09:41.040
colonies under the chaps and under after they were 
freed lots of them were

09:47.011 --> 09:49.634
lifers, this type of thing. From where? I think 
primarily they were shipped down from Manila.

09:57.922 --> 09:59.243
Were they mainly Filipinos? They were all 
Filipinos, yes. These were Filipino prison

10:01.625 --> 10:04.788
institutes. And what island is this on now? This is 
on Palawan. Palawan, okay. But I had dinner with

10:10.814 --> 10:14.858
the the warden on one occasion. We of course they 
had a telephone system of the sort and we had some

10:17.495 --> 10:38.738
equipment people that helped rehab it for him and 
this Major Helles that I'd mentioned before and I

10:17.495 --> 10:38.738
went over and had dinner with him. He was told us 
some of the things. This is the one time

10:45.938 --> 11:11.389
censorship almost got our unit in trouble because 
some of the men had been over it or that were working

10:45.938 --> 11:11.389
over there happened to take a picture where these 
this was prisoners that of the penal colony had

10:45.938 --> 11:11.389
been jumped working out in the fields and they'd 
been jumped by some japs and they were apparently

10:45.938 --> 11:11.389
so hungry that once they took over their food they 
got so busy eating they weren't paying attention

11:12.753 --> 11:36.702
and these Filipinos had proceeded to chop their 
head off with a machete and this picture was of

11:12.753 --> 11:36.702
these three guys standing there with a head in the 
bucket and of course that I'm not real sure where

11:12.753 --> 11:36.702
the whether, as I recall, one of the guys went to the 
censor wanting to know if he could send it home and

11:38.960 --> 11:58.425
this closed down an illicit sort of developing 
photo lab that one of them had blown to one of these

11:38.960 --> 11:58.425
units that had been operating.

12:01.869 --> 12:04.192
Oh my. And then could you go on? Well from after 
rejoining the company at Zamboango we were of

12:08.221 --> 12:33.908
course then went back almost to a basic training 
type situation with the 41st Division preparing

12:08.221 --> 12:33.908
and we had already been assigned a place to land in 
Japan with the 41st when the end of the war came and

12:08.221 --> 12:33.908
at this time then

12:37.398 --> 12:56.284
We disbanded the Company C of the 52nd Signal 
Battalion and I went back to Lady and was wire

12:37.398 --> 12:56.284
officer there at Lady for a

12:37.398 --> 12:56.284
period of probably six or seven more months before 
I came home.

12:59.789 --> 13:01.752
What did you do after you arrived home? Of course, I 
got home, as I recall, in the end of May, first of

13:03.537 --> 13:07.683
June. And I don't remember specifically about how 
I went about it, but I knew I was going back to A&M to

13:09.205 --> 13:20.462
finish. And I had the summer. I spent some time. My 
parents, in the meantime, had gone to Oak Ridge,

13:24.948 --> 13:28.734
Tennessee. And they were there when I got out of the 
service, where I'd going in on active duty there in

13:34.081 --> 13:37.384
Louisiana. I was discharged at Camp McCoy, 
Wisconsin, and from there down to Tennessee. I had

13:44.690 --> 13:56.181
a sister and brother-in-law that lived in 
Rochester, New York, and I went up there for a week

13:44.690 --> 13:56.181
or two before coming back down to A&M to finish up. 
So when did you start back to A&M? I started back in

14:03.865 --> 14:08.952
September, October, whenever, September of 46. 
And graduated in June of 47, May of 47. So you only

14:18.384 --> 14:19.766
had about a year to go. Yes, I liked a year. Were 
there many veterans there when you got there? Yes,

14:25.734 --> 14:27.156
there were lots of them. Where did you live when you 
got there? I don't remember now, 14 I believe it

14:31.456 --> 14:33.840
was. Yes, 13 or 14. This was the next newer dorms 
over on the north side of the campus. In the Sebesa

14:45.819 --> 14:47.121
area. In the Sebesa area, right. These were built 
very similar to 1 to 12 over in the Duncan area, but

14:51.047 --> 14:59.100
they were added down in behind

15:01.527 --> 15:04.150
You went to school then on the GI Bill? Yes, on the GI 
Bill. How much were they paying you? Do you

15:06.692 --> 15:07.633
remember how that worked? Not really. I was 
reading an article in the paper where they were

15:11.037 --> 15:16.282
trying to compare it in those days with now. They 
did pay all the tuition, all your books, and

15:16.302 --> 15:27.754
what have you, and we had

15:30.653 --> 15:56.239
I just don't remember if I had to guess I would have 
said 75 as I recall the paper said something about

15:30.653 --> 15:56.239
115 dollars a month cash but really this I was 
single I've been single and there hadn't been many

15:30.653 --> 15:56.239
places spend any money overseas so this part of it 
wasn't wasn't this hard at this time Do you

15:57.248 --> 16:00.332
remember seeing any changes in the campus when you 
got back? Any attitudes, or were you seeing much

16:00.352 --> 16:04.737
change in the way things were going on? Did it seem 
changed? I don't recall that there was this much

16:08.140 --> 16:17.972
change other than

16:08.140 --> 16:17.972
going to class, this kind of thing. Most of these 
were the same profs you had in EE. It's a smaller

16:22.857 --> 16:25.180
group. possibly than some of the other 
departments, but they were all

16:26.122 --> 16:44.732
leaning over backwards to help you, to give you the 
benefit of the doubt, or what have you, knowing

16:26.122 --> 16:44.732
that you'd been gone for two, two and a half years, 
something like this. Was there much friction

16:47.456 --> 16:51.623
between the new civilian students and the Corps of 
Cadets then?

16:56.041 --> 17:02.330
I don't really recall any particular at all.

17:05.674 --> 17:24.681
We

17:05.674 --> 17:24.681
of course

17:05.674 --> 17:24.681
ate in Sabisa running downstairs as a cafeteria 
type thing with the great influx.

17:25.420 --> 17:51.985
like seven o'clock classes so you were getting 
down there to eat breakfast pretty early if you

17:25.420 --> 17:51.985
went to breakfast and on to class and what have you 
so

17:25.420 --> 17:51.985
and of course by now there are many more cars on the 
campus and you weren't particularly tied down to

17:25.420 --> 17:51.985
the campus so that

17:52.285 --> 17:54.068
So you really didn't notice too many changes. You 
came back and sort of fitted right in without

17:54.949 --> 18:02.800
having any adjustment problems.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.684
I didn't feel that many of us didn't. Probably 
those who had the biggest adjustment problem were

18:06.105 --> 18:14.597
those who had married and started families during 
their time in the service. They were living in the

18:21.023 --> 18:26.289
barracks that had been moved in off over on the 
north side of the campus there.

18:29.032 --> 18:39.405
And these were little bitty apartments and...

18:29.032 --> 18:39.405
Did you have any friends who were in the Corps then 
at that time? I don't recall any in the Corps

18:39.425 --> 18:41.467
particularly. These were all... So most of your 
friends that you had were all veterans? Right,

18:46.073 --> 18:46.974
right. This was the group you associated with. a 
big part. Actually just laying out this one summer

18:50.976 --> 19:17.068
I was in a sense

18:50.976 --> 19:17.068
one a half a semester but also required courses and 
some of this it took me a year many of those who had

18:50.976 --> 19:17.068
were in the class of 44 still like a semester 
certainly to finish and were there so most of you I

18:50.976 --> 19:17.068
mean they were plenty of those you'd been 
associated with all of us living in nearly all of us

19:17.960 --> 19:24.809
living in the same dorm there. Were things a lot 
more crowded then? We were living always then at

19:29.776 --> 19:33.922
least three in a room. Now

19:34.062 --> 19:46.178
when you graduated do you recall let's see how old 
the phrase is What was your first job after you

19:47.288 --> 19:52.075
graduated? Well, since I had some more GI Bill 
available, my older sister was trying to talk me

19:52.095 --> 20:05.456
into coming to New York and live with her and take 
some business. My dad was urging me to get a

20:05.536 --> 20:15.692
master's or something, but I ended up not really 
having made up my mind. came back to Corpus and went

20:16.027 --> 20:27.702
to work as a German electrician at an electric 
construction company and I've been there ever

20:16.027 --> 20:27.702
since.

20:29.845 --> 20:43.823
Oh after about six months working with the tools I 
started estimating and nights and eventually

20:29.845 --> 20:43.823
into the office full-time and now What was your 
connection? How did you go back on your work for

20:48.517 --> 20:51.480
electric construction? I went down. I had worked 
out of the local union, and it was just by chance

20:53.001 --> 20:58.927
that I went there. They had a request in for me, and 
this is where I was sent. So you've been there ever

21:04.932 --> 21:06.174
since. And what's your current position with them 
now? I'm president. When did you become

21:11.959 --> 21:13.000
president? in 1970 I believe it was. I see. Do you 
feel that your education at A&M prepared you for

21:19.478 --> 21:24.304
your current work? Do you feel you were well 
prepared?

21:29.371 --> 21:31.593
Some respects yes, some no.

21:34.617 --> 21:43.628
Mine is not, I mean a contracting business is not, 
there are engineering opportunities there. But

21:44.030 --> 21:51.740
there's also more business requirements

21:44.030 --> 21:51.740
than just the engineering.

21:55.065 --> 22:04.878
Actually, we don't really do

21:55.065 --> 22:04.878
out and out engineering projects. Ours is 
strictly a construction type operation. And

22:10.726 --> 22:13.530
where more business would have helped me more. 
There are a few schools that have started whether

22:17.194 --> 22:24.141
they're still maintaining I'm not sure. I believe 
Tulsa University was one.

22:29.185 --> 22:35.872
A degree in that would lead to a degree in 
electrical contracting. I see. These are though

22:37.333 --> 22:45.120
through the National Electrical Contractors 
Association working with a university to to get

22:45.657 --> 23:01.961
them set up, because there is some basic 
engineering needed,

22:45.657 --> 23:01.961
but also there's lots of business that it would 
help if you knew more of it earlier. This sort of

23:03.023 --> 23:09.252
thing, and this is what I think this other course is 
trying to accomplish.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.935
Are there any comments you feel you'd like to make? 
If you look back over the whole era, do you feel

23:15.097 --> 23:20.884
there were any lost opportunities? Oh, we were 
mentioning the hitchhiking and it came to mind

23:21.605 --> 23:32.879
that the hitchhiking was also kind of set up like 
the hazing. That there was a specific corner in any

23:33.060 --> 23:38.226
given town that you didn't ever start in front of 
that corner. You could start there. You could

23:42.489 --> 23:45.693
start anywhere on down the line. But you didn't 
ever start ahead of that corner. This was being

23:50.820 --> 23:52.442
called upstream. You could go on down. I can recall 
one time going to a football game in Dallas. The

24:01.733 --> 24:03.255
corner was there in Bryan. And when I got in the 
line, I was 103.

24:11.197 --> 24:16.143
About an hour and a half later, I was out, but there 
was a code to the hitchhiking. Only one stood out at

24:17.665 --> 24:19.928
the road. The others were back away from the road. 
If a car stopped, that one would ask, where are you

24:23.613 --> 24:28.178
going, how many will you take? And if he was only 
going a short distance, and if you're in a long

24:29.680 --> 24:40.714
line, you're hoping for that long ride, and if 
you're up to the front, you might say, well, you'll

24:41.487 --> 24:55.985
take two to Hearn and it starts down the line the 
first two down the line that wanted to go but but

24:41.487 --> 24:55.985
this uh really they had developed it to a real code 
of ethics. Was there one then say you were going to

24:56.706 --> 25:01.753
Dallas was there a corner then in Dallas on the way 
back that you didn't start? Yes yes there was

25:01.773 --> 25:09.823
nearly any town of any size there was now you may not 
always know it but pretty much it was the center of

25:10.343 --> 25:13.446
town or some such thing as this. Houston, it was on 
out on the north side of Houston. It wasn't

25:20.033 --> 25:22.095
downtown there in the bigger towns. It was out 
towards where the highways are. There's not much

25:25.599 --> 25:27.621
question of which way you're going. But you always 
had to start from that point. Ethically, yes.

25:32.766 --> 25:33.207
Ethically.

25:36.030 --> 25:38.072
Were there any other rules to this hitchhiking 
game?

25:42.170 --> 25:58.032
No, primarily just this idea that you represented 
A&M, you were courteous, you didn't go to sleep,

25:42.170 --> 25:58.032
you talked to them if they wanted to talk or sat 
there, but you observed these rules. Was it easy or

25:59.975 --> 26:03.960
difficult to get a ride hitchhiking? It was easy, 
pretty much. I can recall one night spending all

26:09.001 --> 26:38.502
night over in Alice when my freshman year I still 
lived there in the valley

26:09.001 --> 26:38.502
but I found out later that a day or two before 
there'd been a hijacking or something of it by

26:09.001 --> 26:38.502
supposedly a hitchhiker and this word always hurt 
the hitchhiker but in the daytime where they could

26:09.001 --> 26:38.502
see the A&M uniform and what have you They were 
always wellies. I can recall my freshman year, the

26:42.364 --> 27:00.026
company commander and the battalion commander 
leaving, hitchhiking to Los Angeles to a football

26:42.364 --> 27:00.026
game, coming back through, changing their 
clothes and hitchhiking to New York to the one the

26:42.364 --> 27:00.026
next weekend.

27:02.789 --> 27:08.877
This is getting along.

27:09.633 --> 27:10.636
Hmm. Anything else you recall? They might want to 
be preserved. You might want to have preserved.

27:17.817 --> 27:18.740
No, not really. Thank you very much.
