00:01.718 --> 00:02.339
What was it? Where was it? What was in it? Bonfire. 
My outfit, first two years I was there, was one of

00:06.768 --> 00:16.407
the stacking units. Only one time do I ever 
remember going out to the cutting fields to do any

00:16.507 --> 00:23.862
cutting of trees. But they'd bring them in to where 
the bonfire was stacked. They'd bring them into

00:27.738 --> 00:29.261
the bonfire area. And our outfit was one of about 
three or so that was responsible for lifting the

00:29.642 --> 00:39.018
logs up and putting them on the stack. And it was 
right there just south of Duncan Hall. And I look

00:44.176 --> 00:51.408
now at how they do all that, take a whole year to do 
it, and we do it on about two weekends, it seems

00:44.176 --> 00:51.408
like. And it was huge, huge. The bonfire was much 
taller, I think. I'm not sure, it's probably

01:00.864 --> 01:07.736
bigger around in circumference now, but ours went 
up a lot taller, I believe. And I developed such a,

01:11.058 --> 01:16.168
resistance to it from freshman and sophomore 
years that your junior and senior year you didn't

01:11.058 --> 01:16.168
have to work on it. I didn't. But it was an 
experience. Let's see. Do you have any nostalgic

01:23.942 --> 01:27.809
memory of when you got your senior ring? Was that a 
special? Yeah. As I remember, I qualified for mine

01:32.894 --> 01:38.142
maybe a little bit early. But I qualified for it 
when I was a junior. But I didn't want to wear it

01:42.488 --> 01:48.157
because I was afraid seniors would get on me. But 
that was the one thing that I really wanted to have.

01:52.082 --> 01:59.914
In fact, I can still remember, I think, getting my 
senior ring was more important to me than getting

01:52.082 --> 01:59.914
senior boots in the Corps. Did you or any of your 
buddies celebrate in any way when you got your

01:59.894 --> 02:04.439
ring? No, they have that tradition now where they 
go dunk their ring or something like that and drink

02:04.459 --> 02:09.325
a pitcher of beer. No, I don't. That wasn't done in 
your era? No. Oh, okay. At least, if it was, I

02:12.829 --> 02:16.814
certainly didn't know that. Because one of our 
children was telling me about that, and they've

02:17.074 --> 02:23.522
heard stories of people trying to to drink and 
almost swallow the ring. I bet that's right. No, I

02:28.460 --> 02:33.064
think the way they do it now is they dunk the ring and 
then you have to drink the pitcher of beer and get it

02:28.460 --> 02:33.064
out. No, there wasn't anything like that. Senior 
boots, did you have new ones? I had new ones. Made at

02:40.852 --> 02:42.874
Hollick's. What did they cost, do you remember?

02:47.399 --> 02:47.739
I don't. I remember I saved up money and bought 
them. Did you keep them or pass? No, I've kept them.

02:54.677 --> 02:55.959
I've kept them. And I don't really have any, I 
didn't have any intentions. Some people wanted to

03:00.507 --> 03:02.630
make lamps and all that stuff. I probably still got 
them at home somewhere. Let's see. Okay, we're

03:09.422 --> 03:10.985
getting close to the end.

03:14.471 --> 03:15.733
What are the... ingredients, what makes up, what 
contributes to Aggie spirit?

03:26.257 --> 03:27.599
That's a hard one to understand. You know, it's a 
funny thing.

03:33.986 --> 03:44.978
I think that what made A&M unique

03:33.986 --> 03:44.978
initially was

03:45.785 --> 03:54.776
was the isolation, the shared bad experiences.

03:57.940 --> 04:00.523
And out of that came some good things.

04:03.406 --> 04:08.873
And I think that that bred a camaraderie

04:03.406 --> 04:08.873
that Maybe it's not being recreated today the same 
way, but it created these traditions. But now the

04:15.933 --> 04:20.398
traditions are honored because they're 
traditions, but back then it was just the way of

04:15.933 --> 04:20.398
life. It was the way things were done. And I think 
that's what it was. I think the groups back in the

04:25.003 --> 04:29.387
30s and 40s, it was deprivation. Most of those guys 
didn't have any money. And they went to A&M to get

04:32.611 --> 04:36.835
skills so they could make a living. By the time I was 
there, it had become more of an academic place.

04:43.835 --> 04:46.740
And even the students who were civilian students 
came there. It was still isolated. It wasn't that

04:49.004 --> 04:50.887
they had it totally easy. It wasn't nearly like it 
is now. They came there and were away from

04:52.990 --> 04:55.034
everything. And I really think that there was a 
closer bond between civilian students and people

04:55.074 --> 05:09.117
in the Corps than people might imagine that there 
was. But I think that's what it was, a sense of when

05:10.430 --> 05:23.967
people look back, I knew that A&M had changed when I 
used to hear people with kids who were at A&M tell

05:10.430 --> 05:23.967
me, oh, they're down there, they love it. Because I 
can remember my freshman year, I never would have

05:26.190 --> 05:32.999
used the words I love it to describe it. What 
qualities does an Aggie have?

05:40.265 --> 05:51.341
You know, I alluded earlier to the belief that one 
of the benefits of the Corps was the leveling

05:40.265 --> 05:51.341
factor. That it made you successful based on what 
you were and not what you had. And I think there's

06:00.734 --> 06:05.580
always been, in a sense, that aspect of A&M. That it 
valued people for merit and for accomplishment.

06:10.488 --> 06:14.854
regardless of bank account or color of their skin 
or anything like that. I would like to think that it

06:16.056 --> 06:25.668
would still be that way, but I think it's probably 
changed some because of the size and

06:16.056 --> 06:25.668
everything. It's a very, well, anybody who thinks 
they can define the Aggie spirit, it's so elusive

06:25.689 --> 06:35.702
because you can't duplicate it. If you try to 
duplicate it, then you say, well, tell us what's

06:36.290 --> 06:40.321
important. And we'll go, hey, you can't make it. 
It's caused by a lot of people who've cared about

06:44.172 --> 06:51.312
that place and put that back into the school. And 
when people talk about, when people talk now in

06:51.832 --> 07:06.612
society about giving back, you won't find any 
better example of people giving back than what has

06:51.832 --> 07:06.612
been given back to that school by former students. 
And I hope that the students now have a sense, some

07:07.153 --> 07:10.658
sense of that. Alright, this is the last question 
that has some, what did it mean to you that you

07:13.061 --> 07:20.151
attended A&M? How did it affect your life? What 
feelings do you have in your heart for A&M now? What

07:29.084 --> 07:32.228
did it mean to you that you went to A&M and said 
somewhere else?

07:34.892 --> 07:41.281
That's a hard question for me to answer because I 
don't have anything to compare it with. So in a

07:41.301 --> 07:44.486
sense, you can't say, well, it changed my life this 
way. I know that it was good in that, first of all, it

07:45.227 --> 07:50.374
gave me... a group of people with good reputations 
to attach my name to. And then when I was out of

07:59.988 --> 08:08.380
school, it gave me some roots, an identity. I could 
identify with it. Because even if I didn't

08:10.423 --> 08:16.733
identify with A&M, everybody else identifies you 
with A&M. And then it gave me people, when I came

08:18.316 --> 08:27.148
back to this town, it gave me people who have 
commonality of shared experiences, even at

08:18.316 --> 08:27.148
different times. And a lot of my best friends 
around here went to India, and we maintained some

08:27.990 --> 08:36.241
of those loyalties. So it's been extremely 
helpful to me in providing that continuous

08:36.261 --> 08:43.311
identity. continuous contact with people that I 
was in school with. And in that sense, that's the

08:48.543 --> 08:53.111
main thing, I think. I'm not sure I've expressed it 
very well. What feelings do you have in your heart

08:55.014 --> 09:00.203
for A&M today?

09:01.347 --> 09:05.993
Well, if you ask my family, they'd probably say 
that it's more important to me than my family, but

09:01.347 --> 09:05.993
it's not. I just want to see it continue to thrive 
and prosper and do well and become better in every

09:07.975 --> 09:17.547
respect. A lot of my friends want to see the Corps 
continue. That's fine. I want to see it do well in

09:22.541 --> 09:33.874
everything it does academically, athletically, 
reputation, bringing in the best students. I want

09:33.994 --> 09:39.140
to see it be excellent in every regard. So that's 
just, I don't know if that expresses it very well.

09:43.645 --> 09:46.849
Is there anything we haven't talked about that we 
should have? I don't know. I feel like I'm drained.

09:50.918 --> 09:52.701
I had thought about a lot of this stuff. What you're 
telling me then, there's not something about,

09:52.721 --> 09:57.569
well, hey, I was just waiting for him to get to this, 
that, or the other. I don't think so. I've tried to

09:59.632 --> 10:03.718
ask you similar questions that I have to anyone 
else. So let's quit with that.
