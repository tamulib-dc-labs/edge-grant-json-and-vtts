WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:15.215
The Big Z. He would occasionally come to see me and tell him, he never tried to pressure me into changing a grade, but he would say that this guy, how's he doing, you know.

00:15.235 --> 00:23.924
He came to my office though personally, asked me how's he doing, you know, and would it be helpful to give him a tutor and stuff like that.

00:24.985 --> 00:26.427
So he called me the Big Z.

00:26.643 --> 00:28.707
Did he ever ask for anything?

00:28.747 --> 00:31.392
He never asked me to change a grade or anything like that.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.474
No, no, no.

00:32.494 --> 00:40.589
That's one thing that's never happened to me here, because I got to know the football coaches pretty well, because my students got jobs there tutoring.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.234
See they got jobs there tutoring.

00:43.754 --> 00:46.598
But they never asked for a grade change or anything like that.

00:46.839 --> 00:55.712
Of the football coaches, and I'm going to ask the negative, of the football coaches, which ones would you give the highest marks to in doing things the way they should have?

00:55.952 --> 00:57.695
Oh goodness, I don't remember his name.

00:57.775 --> 01:02.742
He was the guy who was here when we had Woodard in a cloud of dust.

01:03.127 --> 01:07.935
In fact the son of his assistant coach became an end for us just recently.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.319
But he came from a high school.

01:11.561 --> 01:13.103
You can probably figure it out though.

01:13.123 --> 01:13.844
I should remember.

01:15.166 --> 01:16.749
Baumgartner was the assistant coach.

01:16.769 --> 01:18.672
I remember him.

01:18.652 --> 01:23.060
It's in the 70s because Tony Franklin was the kicker on that team.

01:23.842 --> 01:24.884
But I can't remember the name of the coach.

01:24.904 --> 01:26.106
But I thought he ran a good show.

01:26.627 --> 01:29.913
Now I've had nothing to do with the subsequent guys, so I don't know.

01:30.093 --> 01:33.480
But I have every reason to believe our current coach runs a clean show.

01:34.983 --> 01:36.846
Did you ever get any

01:37.315 --> 01:49.823
any calls or any kind of contact from politicians, former students, any outsider trying to influence a grade?

01:49.923 --> 01:51.467
Never, never, never, never.

01:51.507 --> 01:53.451
In 46 years, never at once.

01:53.431 --> 01:54.574
Great.

01:55.296 --> 02:07.609
And what about, let's see, you weren't part of the group to decide who got admitted to the graduate program, so you didn't get any pressure about letting my son... No, no, no, no.

02:07.977 --> 02:19.618
No we're pretty good about that, that we have a graduate, a man who's in charge of admission to graduate school, and he will at times give you a folder.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.784
Just what do you think of this person?

02:22.804 --> 02:23.505
That's all.

02:23.857 --> 02:26.782
But he makes the decision pretty much on his own.

02:28.144 --> 02:28.245
Okay.

02:28.265 --> 02:32.472
All right, let's go back to campus events.

02:32.552 --> 02:35.257
You and your colleagues had a good respect for Earl Rutter.

02:35.657 --> 02:44.473
Were you all aware of any approaching health problems before his death?

02:44.493 --> 02:46.035
No, at least I wasn't.

02:46.096 --> 02:47.999
I never heard anybody talk about it either.

02:48.139 --> 02:48.700
I wasn't either.

02:49.338 --> 02:50.800
Had he been ill?

02:50.860 --> 02:53.402
Was it known that he'd been quite ill prior to his death?

02:53.422 --> 03:00.530
His heart and kidney were giving him trouble, I now know, for two or three months.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.632
Well, weren't the physicians aware of this?

03:02.992 --> 03:03.513
Big pardon?

03:03.533 --> 03:05.315
Weren't the physicians aware of this?

03:05.335 --> 03:06.036
Apparently so.

03:07.898 --> 03:13.644
But the medications also, for the two, each made the other problem worse.

03:14.004 --> 03:15.025
Oh, that's too bad.

03:15.005 --> 03:22.274
And do you remember any reaction when Jack Williams came as President?

03:23.155 --> 03:31.885
Well the general feeling was that he was a healthy addition, that he was a breath of fresh air, you know, that he was smelling roses now.

03:31.905 --> 03:35.689
Did you all feel good about him academically?

03:36.230 --> 03:43.138
Oh yeah, I think that my feeling and the feeling of my peers, the ones with whom I discussed such matters,

03:44.097 --> 03:45.479
was that this is a good guy.

03:45.499 --> 03:48.443
He's going to be a plus, a big plus to the institution.

03:48.463 --> 03:52.890
All right, now, Zener, by that time, was the vice president for academic affairs.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.152
Zener got to that job?

03:54.172 --> 03:55.273
I knew he was dean of science.

03:55.414 --> 03:56.415
Briefly.

03:56.435 --> 03:56.856
Ah, okay.

03:56.876 --> 04:00.080
And then John Calhoun became the vice president.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.402
Ah, okay, okay.

04:01.422 --> 04:04.587
What did you all think of that team of Calhoun and Williams?

04:06.389 --> 04:11.877
I say the general attitude was a very favorable one that, you know, that things are going to get better around here.

04:11.917 --> 04:15.122
We're going to become more like a real university should be.

04:16.244 --> 04:18.427
Well I think we've gotten pretty darn close to that now.

04:18.447 --> 04:21.772
But it took these steps by these individuals.

04:22.473 --> 04:33.510
And were you all happy that things like the cyclotron and the growth of graduate programs all across the campus, did you all like that?

04:33.895 --> 04:39.702
Yeah, very definitely, because this, you know, marks you as a university.

04:41.585 --> 04:50.276
And in the department, was there, was the growth rate of research up sharply?

04:52.118 --> 04:57.625
Yeah, however, yes it was, but however I attribute this more to Martell than anything else.

04:57.908 --> 05:03.076
Where did he go to find more support?

05:03.497 --> 05:05.540
Did he help to dig up money?

05:07.463 --> 05:11.889
Well, I think mostly, like I say, he went to administration here with his letter.

05:12.030 --> 05:15.495
But on the other hand, his reputation was such

05:15.914 --> 05:17.235
that he could go to companies.

05:17.315 --> 05:34.513
And they set up, I forget what they call it, but it's a group of industrial companies, chemical companies, and the group exists to this day, the only thing I don't remember is what they call it, that contribute financially to the department.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.956
And so he certainly set that up.

05:38.697 --> 05:44.082
Now in that effort, we were beginning to be competitive with what other

05:44.568 --> 06:07.960
You're talking about, oh yeah, UT for one, Purdue, Michigan, maybe not California and MIT and Harvard, but I think with the well-known public universities, like I say Michigan, University of Texas, which are highly rated, Purdue, that we're ranked up there with Minnesota,

06:08.108 --> 06:12.676
Did we have any closer relations with certain chemistry departments?

06:13.197 --> 06:14.660
Were there two or three that we were?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.046
Not really, not really.

06:18.146 --> 06:21.191
Was there any that A&M was kind of using as a model?

06:23.555 --> 06:26.701
Oh, I can't point to one.

06:28.003 --> 06:30.167
Now Martell had been, where was he before he came here?

06:30.620 --> 06:32.562
Illinois Institute of Technology.

06:32.582 --> 06:36.467
But he had been for a long time at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.

06:36.567 --> 06:41.212
That's where he really got his professional recognition.

06:41.573 --> 06:45.257
Because Dow Chemical Company was right there.

06:45.377 --> 06:52.045
And they had come up with this new chelating agent that had acquired very important industrial applications.

06:52.105 --> 06:54.208
And he worked with them very intimately.

06:55.229 --> 06:56.971
Who identified Martell?

06:57.011 --> 06:57.431
Do you know?

06:57.471 --> 06:58.633
It was not.

06:59.514 --> 07:00.475
But I think

07:01.484 --> 07:02.945
other members of the faculty.

07:02.965 --> 07:07.149
I think Isbell was important in saying this man is available.

07:08.271 --> 07:09.832
He's one that I can think of.

07:10.132 --> 07:13.776
But other than that, I wouldn't be able to give you any information.

07:13.836 --> 07:15.217
Did he hit the ground running?

07:16.078 --> 07:16.458
Oh, yes.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.019
When he got here?

07:17.119 --> 07:17.700
Oh, you bet.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.241
I mean, he surely did.

07:19.281 --> 07:21.844
Describe his personality.

07:22.324 --> 07:25.427
What did he look like and how did he go about doing things?

07:27.589 --> 07:30.512
Well, I suppose there's a time when

07:30.661 --> 07:37.391
A little dictatorial power is not a bad thing to get things done and get the ball rolling.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.014
And I must admit, he's that kind of a guy.

07:41.056 --> 07:44.300
He's the boss, there's no question about it.

07:44.401 --> 07:45.943
And was that true from day one?

07:46.564 --> 07:46.844
Yes.

07:47.225 --> 07:51.310
From the minute his shoes were planted on this campus, that was true.

07:52.392 --> 07:55.296
Probably more so at the very start than subsequently.

07:55.336 --> 07:57.579
Subsequently, gave in a little bit.

07:57.619 --> 08:00.263
We had different committees that reported to him and such.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.436
And he was department head about how many years?

08:03.858 --> 08:13.510
Well, he came in 67, and it's only, I'd say, a good, gee, maybe 20 years, maybe, yeah, yeah.

08:13.530 --> 08:18.837
And during that time, who were the key members of the department head staff?

08:20.659 --> 08:27.027
Oh man, he had a fellow named Shapiro, but Shapiro was strictly a,

08:28.525 --> 08:29.867
administrative aid.

08:29.947 --> 08:35.733
He did some chemistry and it was good, but it was kind of a minor part of his responsibilities.

08:37.275 --> 08:47.307
And then he relied heavily on input from the new well-known professors I brought in.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.450
He was very close to Professor Tsutsui, for example.

08:50.510 --> 08:51.231
He brought him in.

08:51.251 --> 08:52.693
He'd known him previously.

08:53.922 --> 09:12.642
He would periodically bring in some well-known person that he knew, like he brought the fellow Japanese name, I forget his name, to just come in every so often and sit down and show them what the department was doing, where it was going, did he have any ideas what else we should do, this kind of stuff.

09:14.343 --> 09:17.907
Martell physically was what, 5'8", 5'9", average size?

09:17.927 --> 09:18.908
Yeah, about 5'8".

09:19.909 --> 09:22.512
Sense of humor?

09:22.762 --> 09:24.164
Not much of one at all.

09:24.184 --> 09:25.726
No, not much of one at all.

09:26.427 --> 09:27.489
No, he was all business.

09:28.591 --> 09:29.131
Hard worker?

09:29.292 --> 09:30.393
Oh yes.

09:30.413 --> 09:32.877
You don't get things done like he didn't.

09:32.897 --> 09:37.884
He had a very, very large research program, you know, it was big.

09:37.904 --> 09:38.305
Himself?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.608
Himself, yeah.

09:41.209 --> 09:44.374
And he normally was here on campus from what hour to what hour?

09:45.896 --> 09:51.925
Oh heavens, I'd say, you know, I don't know, I didn't keep track of it, but he usually was here when I got in.

09:52.428 --> 09:54.330
And he was here all day long when I left.

09:54.631 --> 09:56.854
He put in a full day, no question about it.

09:57.274 --> 10:00.839
Did he have any particular pet peeves, things that really bugged him?

10:01.640 --> 10:09.230
Well, I think he expected all of his faculty to be able to get a federal research grant.

10:09.771 --> 10:10.732
He sized it up that way.

10:10.752 --> 10:11.533
I don't agree with that.

10:12.155 --> 10:20.192
because there's a hell of a lot of politics going into that, and there's things like what's currently fashionable in the research area and such.

10:21.073 --> 10:28.088
But he felt that if you didn't do that, and then he was very, very adamant in his feelings about

10:30.127 --> 10:32.350
what you did and how you did it.

10:32.631 --> 10:39.842
And, well, he didn't think that, you know, we get these ratings, teaching evaluations.

10:39.962 --> 10:41.665
He didn't think much of those things.

10:41.745 --> 10:42.286
I know that.

10:43.007 --> 10:48.015
He largely evaluated people on the basis of research productivity.

10:48.796 --> 10:50.458
I don't think that's entirely correct.

10:50.599 --> 10:53.082
I think in the university there should be a little bit more.

10:54.164 --> 10:57.990
Who, in those long years you were

10:58.291 --> 11:03.677
in the faculty of the department, who were the best teachers in the department?

11:03.937 --> 11:05.118
You mean actual teachers?

11:05.138 --> 11:05.399
Yes.

11:06.600 --> 11:12.987
Well you know several left, like Henry Rakoff, and they were I think exceptionally good teachers.

11:15.649 --> 11:20.675
Gee whiz, I have a hard time remembering because you're going way back.

11:20.715 --> 11:26.661
Because when Martell first came, how should I put it, the writing was on the wall, you know.

11:27.265 --> 11:33.239
If you were really a good teacher, you probably didn't have a great future in that department.

11:33.379 --> 11:35.043
That's a perfectly honest statement.

11:35.063 --> 11:36.867
I think Arthur Martell would agree to it.

11:38.370 --> 11:45.426
And were you expected to produce a good stream of doctoral students?

11:46.553 --> 11:51.863
You're expected to produce a good steady stream of publications and get money.

11:51.903 --> 11:53.646
That's the two key things.

11:53.706 --> 11:57.012
You know that thing about publications, and I don't think they mean that much.

11:57.112 --> 12:00.158
I just got through reviewing an article, for example, today.

12:01.032 --> 12:03.916
perfectly good, but not really important.

12:04.357 --> 12:12.348
I mean, of every 500 that you review, there'll be one or two that are really meaningful science medicine.

12:12.689 --> 12:16.374
But that's part of our system, and I'm not going to, you know, fight it.

12:17.195 --> 12:24.566
Like they say, they say, deans and heads may not be able to read or write, but they can count.

12:24.586 --> 12:25.527
You've heard that.

12:25.547 --> 12:26.729
Yes.

12:26.749 --> 12:30.094
In all of your research,

12:31.340 --> 12:40.870
What was your first, as you think back, what was your first important publication?

12:40.890 --> 12:41.410
Oh, heavens.

12:41.591 --> 12:43.372
You mean something I really thought was worthwhile?

12:43.513 --> 12:44.474
Yeah, early on.

12:44.674 --> 12:45.875
Well, how can I tell you now?

12:45.915 --> 12:46.656
How can I tell you?

12:46.856 --> 12:57.567
I think it was a really clever synthesis of telluranthrine because the literature had totally made a mess of it.

12:58.002 --> 13:03.590
And I came up with what I think was a really bright synthetic procedure.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.551
About when was that?

13:05.292 --> 13:06.434
About 1980.

13:06.574 --> 13:06.734
Oh.

13:07.135 --> 13:23.858
And then when it was at Oak Ridge I think we turned out a very, very nice paper on uranium extraction which got a lot of recognition and got beautiful reviews when we submitted it for publication.

13:25.103 --> 13:34.321
But most recently, right now, I'm hoping that what I'm working on right now may be the most important thing I've ever done.

13:34.441 --> 13:34.922
What is it?

13:34.982 --> 13:36.124
Well, I don't know.

13:36.284 --> 13:40.212
I'm working with MD Anderson on some arsenic compounds.

13:40.232 --> 13:44.580
We started working with arsenic in 1959.

13:47.699 --> 13:54.028
Excellent results on in vitro testing against cancer lines.

13:54.048 --> 13:58.715
It's also been done by the National Institutes of Health and very interesting results.

13:59.116 --> 14:01.920
And we've got a patent that was filed in January.

14:03.942 --> 14:06.606
And now we're waiting for animal testing.

14:06.626 --> 14:09.150
So that the arsenic would be a deterrent?

14:09.788 --> 14:14.476
It would kill cancer cells without bothering normal cells.

14:15.056 --> 14:22.468
But this is something I tell you, and it's by no means meaningful at the present time.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.614
All right, but let's go back to the beginning.

14:26.014 --> 14:28.799
What was your first scholarly publication?

14:29.259 --> 14:33.366
My first one was, hell, that goes back to 1948 or 49.

14:34.257 --> 14:35.659
When I was a graduate student.

14:35.679 --> 14:36.140
Really?

14:36.160 --> 14:36.941
Yeah.

14:37.001 --> 14:37.662
Where, what?

14:37.722 --> 14:38.864
At the University of Kansas.

14:38.884 --> 14:39.765
No, what journal?

14:40.326 --> 14:42.449
Oh, Journal of the American Chemical Society.

14:42.469 --> 14:44.593
It was a very, you know, prestigious journal.

14:45.394 --> 14:49.340
And I thought, man, that was great, you know, when I was 20, how old was I?

14:49.360 --> 14:52.084
23 years old or something like that.

14:52.104 --> 14:54.207
I thought it was a pretty fantastic event in my life.

14:56.230 --> 15:02.880
Is there, is there one, of all your research, of which are you most proud?

15:05.577 --> 15:08.921
Well, I think, like I say, I think these, this group of varsity companies.

15:08.941 --> 15:09.582
That you're working on.

15:09.602 --> 15:10.644
Yeah.

15:10.664 --> 15:18.374
Because it started up back in 1978 or 79, because I was really annoyed.

15:18.434 --> 15:22.679
I'd sent a research application, I forget who, Department of Energy, one of those guys.

15:24.442 --> 15:31.551
And they sent it back and said, our guys have tried to do this, they've never been able to do this, so we don't think there's any future in it.

15:32.071 --> 15:35.355
And I came up with an idea that would work, and it worked.

15:37.658 --> 15:41.042
I'm proud of that because I get annoyed when people say it can't be done.

15:41.643 --> 15:46.689
About how many, if we were to count them, how many publications?

15:46.709 --> 15:47.169
Total?

15:48.170 --> 15:48.651
Right now?

15:49.091 --> 15:49.652
About 220.

15:49.692 --> 15:58.703
And if we tallied up all of the research funding that you have gathered

15:59.138 --> 16:01.062
and brought to the campus, what might that be?

16:01.122 --> 16:06.311
Oh heavens, I really can't tell you, but for a period of about three years I was getting over $200,000 a year.

16:07.514 --> 16:10.920
Other than that, you know, it's in the neighborhood, it varied, you know.

16:12.082 --> 16:18.695
Years ago when I got my first one from the Atomic Energy Commission in 59, it was only $18,000.

16:19.115 --> 16:22.682
But it was okay for them because a graduate student would only get

16:23.607 --> 16:27.251
$150 a month or something like that, you see.

16:27.271 --> 16:29.293
So it'd be pretty difficult to tally it.

16:29.313 --> 16:29.914
I could do it.

16:30.074 --> 16:40.146
I'm sure the file was there in the department files, but for a couple of years I got between $200,000 and $250,000 a year, which was my top, so I've never gone back there.

16:41.347 --> 16:50.357
In all of these years, have you done any research and or teaching off campus at other places?

16:50.675 --> 16:53.960
Well, we had this extension program with Dow Chemical, did you know that?

16:54.000 --> 16:54.581
Where was that?

16:54.902 --> 16:55.382
Freeport.

16:55.462 --> 16:56.384
At Freeport, okay.

16:56.624 --> 17:01.251
You know, let you think of it though, like just the, you brought up the subject.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.316
The Welch Foundation alone has been given me only since 1960.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.880
That's 40 years.

17:08.383 --> 17:11.367
So that's going to come out to over a million dollars, I think.

17:13.290 --> 17:16.395
So you know, a lot was probably a million and a half or so, you know.

17:17.101 --> 17:23.708
Now, the Welch Foundation has been truly significant to the chemistry program here, hasn't it?

17:23.728 --> 17:24.048
Oh, yes.

17:24.309 --> 17:24.969
I think so.

17:26.611 --> 17:33.879
What were the original close links that got A&M and Welch together?

17:33.899 --> 17:34.299
Do you know?

17:34.739 --> 17:39.805
Well, it's just the nature of the will that Mr. Welch left.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.627
In other words, they had his money, a lot of money.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.830
And they were obligated by law

17:45.232 --> 17:47.936
and by what's written in the will to give out this money.

17:48.036 --> 17:48.997
So where else to give it?

17:49.578 --> 17:52.161
But A&M wasn't getting much of it when you got here.

17:53.523 --> 18:00.532
Well, not as much as University of Texas or Rice, because they had big, well-established research programs.

18:00.552 --> 18:05.499
As far as you know, how do our Welch monies compare now with Rice and UT?

18:05.519 --> 18:07.121
Oh, I think they're very comparable.

18:07.542 --> 18:08.263
Absolutely.

18:08.843 --> 18:09.645
Very much so.

18:10.165 --> 18:12.268
Virtually every member of faculty has one.

18:12.721 --> 18:20.097
As far as you know, does the Welch Foundation fund research here fairly?

18:20.117 --> 18:22.382
As far as I know, they do.

18:22.803 --> 18:23.444
As far as I know.

18:24.887 --> 18:27.473
People may have a different opinion, but I think they do.

18:27.493 --> 18:30.780
Is there any other fund anywhere else in the nation?

18:31.520 --> 18:32.842
like Welch?

18:32.962 --> 18:34.825
No, there's no fund in the world, I think.

18:34.945 --> 18:36.427
Maybe Nobel may do it.

18:37.088 --> 18:40.554
That funds strictly for chemistry, and then restrict it to the state.

18:40.694 --> 18:41.916
Yeah, that's what I was meaning.

18:42.296 --> 18:43.718
For chemistry in this state.

18:43.738 --> 18:45.481
No, heavens, there's nothing like it.

18:45.561 --> 18:46.943
That is marvelous.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.986
It's a real plus for the state.

18:49.347 --> 18:56.177
Well, the initial amount of money they started with, man, they've turned it into, what, about $600 million now?

18:56.197 --> 18:58.601
I mean, they've done a great job investing that money.

18:58.981 --> 18:59.522
Great job.

18:59.582 --> 19:00.784
Now, the Welch money,

19:01.456 --> 19:03.658
goes to research projects.

19:03.678 --> 19:04.839
Strictly, yeah.

19:04.859 --> 19:11.586
And then graduate students get support for their part of that project, don't they?

19:11.626 --> 19:12.768
Absolutely, yeah.

19:12.828 --> 19:16.271
Now, one thing they do with these smaller liberal arts schools, they give them money.

19:16.671 --> 19:18.173
And that's not for research.

19:18.193 --> 19:20.475
It's just to promote their chemistry programs.

19:20.555 --> 19:23.458
But it still has to be used for chemistry in other ways.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.042
Now, throughout most of your years here,

19:27.410 --> 19:33.238
your salary has come partly from state funding and partly from the research projects.

19:33.258 --> 19:37.805
Well, in the research projects, rarely, except for summer.

19:38.005 --> 19:39.106
Summer salary.

19:39.126 --> 19:40.669
Summer salary, absolutely.

19:41.290 --> 19:46.797
At times, you go half, I've gone half-time teaching and gotten half from the research grant.

19:46.817 --> 19:48.760
That's happened to me several occasions.

19:49.195 --> 19:58.766
About when did you feel that you had appropriately good research facilities here?

19:58.987 --> 20:02.471
Well, I'd say about somewhere 65 to 70.

20:03.953 --> 20:07.277
And since that time, you've been relatively comfortable?

20:07.297 --> 20:12.663
Not only that, I think they've just gotten better on a regular basis.

20:12.903 --> 20:15.186
The type of equipment we have is

20:15.824 --> 20:24.800
The amount of equipment we have has just increased and always gotten to be, what do they say, state-of-the-art stuff.

20:24.820 --> 20:25.782
There's no doubt about that.

20:26.463 --> 20:27.845
All right, back to chronology.

20:28.406 --> 20:31.652
Jack Williams is president here and Calhoun the vice president.

20:32.453 --> 20:37.342
Did you and your colleagues feel that A&M was making academic progress?

20:37.623 --> 20:38.965
Yeah, very definitely.

20:39.286 --> 20:40.127
We thought we were.

20:40.394 --> 20:46.960
Actually, you know, assuming the visage of a real university.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.402
Then Dr. Williams gets sick.

20:49.842 --> 20:51.544
He died, didn't he, from heart attacks?

20:51.564 --> 20:51.804
Yes.

20:52.725 --> 21:06.978
And of all the presidents you have observed here, from David Morgan to the present, I'm not going to ask the negative, to which of those presidents would you give the highest marks for their leadership?

21:07.038 --> 21:07.618
That's easy.

21:08.359 --> 21:09.760
Earl Rudder, without question.

21:10.128 --> 21:10.869
Anybody else?

21:11.410 --> 21:15.016
Well, Williams was real good, and Morgan I liked a lot, too.

21:16.919 --> 21:18.481
I hardly remember the others.

21:18.561 --> 21:22.387
I didn't ever pay much attention to what's going on in the upper echelons.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.512
But your answer is almost exactly the same as everybody else's.

21:26.313 --> 21:29.899
To which deans of science would you give the highest mark?

21:29.919 --> 21:31.862
Oh, I like Mac Prescott.

21:31.882 --> 21:33.003
I really like Mac Prescott.

21:33.023 --> 21:34.967
Describe him as dean.

21:34.987 --> 21:38.532
Well, once again, I feel that when you can pick up the phone,

21:40.233 --> 21:46.244
talk to your superior and he has the time and the ear for you, that's what counts.

21:46.945 --> 21:48.889
And he never gave me a big song and dance.

21:52.636 --> 22:03.355
I would go there, I mean once again I always could get to see him, we'd sit down and talk, he'd listen to what you had to say, and more often than not he would satisfy my request.

22:04.111 --> 22:15.870
Now here's another couple, one or so deans, one or so, I'd like to mention one whose name I shan't give, who always told me what he was going to do for me, but never did a dadgum thing, nothing.

22:16.291 --> 22:23.422
But at the time I'd see him, he'd say, oh, I'm going to send you to this meeting and nothing ever happened.

22:25.045 --> 22:29.152
I mean I'm like a guy who doesn't give me a lot of B.S.

22:29.653 --> 22:30.574
to be put.

22:31.988 --> 22:34.612
And also, if he's going to say no, no.

22:34.632 --> 22:35.973
There's no arguing about it.

22:36.034 --> 22:41.361
But more often than not, I got help from Mac Prescott.

22:41.681 --> 22:45.727
Did you all think that he was sensitive to what real research was all about?

22:46.007 --> 22:50.053
Well, I think so, because he had himself, he had personal experience in the field.

22:50.093 --> 22:52.356
That means a lot.

22:52.376 --> 22:54.739
Now, I like Zener a great deal.

22:54.854 --> 23:01.140
I just think Zener didn't give a damn about administrative problems of the dean.

23:02.201 --> 23:03.842
He was a true scientist.

23:04.182 --> 23:10.808
I mean like I said, every time I went there, he got the chalk and the blackboard and I had to listen to a physics lecture.

23:10.828 --> 23:19.696
Did you ever do any, have any important research cooperation with people from outside the chemistry department?

23:20.757 --> 23:21.538
Well I do now.

23:22.079 --> 23:24.861
Very, very intense with MD Anderson people.

23:25.634 --> 23:27.276
But none here on the campus.

23:27.296 --> 23:31.860
And I'm trying to remember the, not really, no.

23:32.421 --> 23:34.943
Peripheral perhaps, you know, but not.

23:34.963 --> 23:38.527
What about relations between the chemistry department and chemical engineering?

23:39.248 --> 23:43.972
Oh they've always, I feel, have been, you know, real good.

23:43.992 --> 23:47.056
There's never been any bad feelings.

23:49.798 --> 23:54.443
Well I know one guy I admire greatly was Charlie Holland from chemical engineering.

23:55.790 --> 24:02.759
Because if anybody ever worked hard for his department and built a good department by his labors, Charlie did that.

24:02.819 --> 24:03.900
When did y'all get acquainted?

24:04.441 --> 24:07.065
Oh, heck, I got acquainted shortly after I got here.

24:08.026 --> 24:09.307
So you've been friends ever since?

24:09.348 --> 24:10.489
Yeah, he's a fine man.

24:10.689 --> 24:11.170
You bet.

24:11.210 --> 24:12.111
He's a fine man.

24:12.291 --> 24:12.932
You bet.

24:13.092 --> 24:13.713
You bet.

24:14.594 --> 24:16.857
Let me turn it off and tell you how that it goes.

24:18.459 --> 24:24.447
As you think about all of these 40 years plus,

24:25.490 --> 24:34.922
What are some of the happiest moments for you as a faculty member, as a parent, as a husband?

24:34.942 --> 24:37.966
Well, I got the research award.

24:38.006 --> 24:43.032
That certainly was the happiest moment, 67 or 68, I don't remember.

24:43.052 --> 24:43.873
Okay.

24:43.893 --> 24:49.060
And... Yeah, oh yeah, my watch, I got it.

24:49.120 --> 24:53.826
How did you, did you have any hint that you were going to win it?

24:54.852 --> 24:55.432
Not really.

24:55.453 --> 24:56.694
No, I don't believe I did.

24:58.075 --> 24:58.195
Uh-uh.

24:58.215 --> 24:59.416
And was it $1,000?

24:59.456 --> 25:03.079
No, I think it was, maybe, no, I think it was $1,000.

25:03.099 --> 25:03.980
What did you do with the money?

25:04.900 --> 25:06.442
Criminy, I don't remember.

25:06.462 --> 25:08.103
I just socked it away in the bank.

25:08.163 --> 25:09.985
I might have taken my wife out to dinner.

25:12.467 --> 25:17.031
And you didn't take a special trip or anything?

25:17.051 --> 25:19.052
No, it was not a convenient time.

25:19.113 --> 25:22.936
What did your buddies in the department, what did they say?

25:23.176 --> 25:24.437
Well, they were all very, you know,

25:24.755 --> 25:27.579
generous in their praise and shook your hand.

25:27.659 --> 25:31.163
Nobody was resentful that I'm aware of.

25:32.385 --> 25:43.179
Don't you think it was good that in those days you learned that you were an award winner in the presence of almost all of the faculty?

25:43.880 --> 25:45.242
Yeah, it's a good feeling.

25:46.724 --> 25:51.690
I thought that was really, really good and that it was a surprise

25:52.025 --> 25:53.988
But a very, very pleasant surprise.

25:54.008 --> 25:58.614
Well, I felt real good when we beat Texas when you were 13-7, I remember.

25:58.634 --> 26:03.220
Because one of the kids in my class was a linebacker.

26:04.602 --> 26:07.085
And I saw him right after the game.

26:07.346 --> 26:08.687
He was still in uniform.

26:09.208 --> 26:10.590
I don't remember his name.

26:11.009 --> 26:11.890
He was thrilled.

26:13.551 --> 26:19.417
Did athletics ever ask you to undo a grade?

26:19.457 --> 26:19.717
Never.

26:19.837 --> 26:22.399
Like I've told you, this is one thing I never encountered.

26:22.419 --> 26:24.241
There was never pressure to raise a grade.

26:25.522 --> 26:26.383
Never, never, never.

26:26.403 --> 26:34.630
The only thing they always did was ask me whether, at times, this guy, do you think this guy can pass or not, you know?

26:34.710 --> 26:36.232
And I would give him an honest answer.

26:36.572 --> 26:38.634
And they'd maybe let him Q drop early on.

26:38.714 --> 26:41.016
Now that's one thing that happened a few times.

26:41.570 --> 26:47.381
And chemistry was considered a pretty demanding elective science course, wasn't it?

26:47.721 --> 26:51.087
Yeah, but we had a special course, which we'd done away.

26:51.428 --> 26:51.769
What was it?

26:51.809 --> 26:53.011
Chemistry 106.

26:53.071 --> 26:53.932
What was it?

26:53.952 --> 27:00.304
It was a one semester, very, you know, I looked at some of my old tests.

27:01.988 --> 27:02.949
Patsy course.

27:03.009 --> 27:06.193
We did some really honest things in there, you know, real chemistry.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.575
Sort of, general chemistry?

27:07.595 --> 27:08.236
Yeah, yeah.

27:08.256 --> 27:11.760
But, you know, we kind of emphasized some of the practical aspects and things.

27:13.002 --> 27:14.764
And the athletes used to take that.

27:14.804 --> 27:17.487
But I said, it's a good many years, at least 10 outs.

27:17.507 --> 27:19.149
It was discontinued.

27:19.690 --> 27:25.397
Of all the chemistry courses that undergraduates took, which one had the reputation of being the toughest?

27:27.048 --> 27:27.789
Good heavens.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.091
I don't really know.

27:29.111 --> 27:32.335
I would think maybe one of those physical chemistry courses.

27:32.996 --> 27:37.802
But the number, I don't recollect what it is, 318, 319, one of those.

27:39.123 --> 27:43.970
One of the reasons being that the people who taught it were awfully tough.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.291
I mean, that's a fact now.

27:45.932 --> 27:54.263
As far as you know, who, if we were able to poll the students, who were their favorite chemistry teachers?

27:54.283 --> 27:55.564
Right now I can tell you.

27:55.604 --> 27:56.025
Okay.

27:57.170 --> 28:02.238
But neither one, both are instructors, they are not tenured faculty.

28:03.019 --> 28:05.403
Gigi's name is Gopalakrishnan.

28:06.605 --> 28:17.121
I know that he's just extremely popular, and the other fellow, not Pendleton, I always call him Pendleton, but his name is not Pendleton, it's close to that.

28:18.944 --> 28:21.388
Those two, without question, I think are the most

28:21.520 --> 28:22.982
popular people on the faculty.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.545
As far as you know, are they doing a college?

28:25.565 --> 28:28.088
I think they do an outstanding job of teaching, yeah.

28:28.869 --> 28:34.497
I know they're just two doors down from me, and that hallway's always full of kids.

28:35.198 --> 28:40.585
I mean, they are unselfish with respect to the time they give to the students.

28:41.526 --> 28:50.317
Should fine research universities like A&M give more attention to the quality of teaching at the undergraduate level?

28:50.337 --> 28:51.038
Yeah, they really should.

28:51.406 --> 28:59.197
I don't think they do it sufficiently, although actually with these instructorships, they take care of that problem quite well.

29:00.319 --> 29:01.601
Pendleton's disgusting.

29:04.104 --> 29:10.674
But on the other hand, I think that our top research professors should teach also.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.977
I mean get in the classroom and teach.

29:13.759 --> 29:16.823
I understand Enrico Fermi always taught

29:17.039 --> 29:19.122
freshman physics throughout his life.

29:19.142 --> 29:20.944
He didn't live to be very old.

29:20.964 --> 29:28.135
Every semester that I was a dean, a president, and a chancellor, I taught a freshman section of American history.

29:28.635 --> 29:29.036
Oh, really?

29:29.136 --> 29:30.157
That's a good idea.

29:30.177 --> 29:34.744
And as a result, I had some idea of what was really happening.

29:35.765 --> 29:41.393
Like one time, I found out that the bookstore hadn't ordered the textbooks they were supposed to order on time.

29:42.301 --> 29:43.702
I wouldn't have known that otherwise.

29:44.063 --> 29:47.345
I was able to get that straightened out because of being the chancellor.

29:48.086 --> 29:54.111
And it also helped me hear the excuses, the pleas, the beggings.

29:55.072 --> 29:57.334
Some faculty don't come well prepared.

29:57.434 --> 29:58.015
No, no.

29:58.495 --> 30:06.682
I have sat in on some courses, I won't say which, and well, I don't say they don't know their subject.

30:06.702 --> 30:07.583
They know their subject.

30:08.744 --> 30:11.346
But there's no organization.

30:12.389 --> 30:14.053
And some people can't be heard.

30:14.093 --> 30:16.941
Yeah.

30:17.362 --> 30:20.289
What were the, were there some legendary tough courses?

30:22.274 --> 30:23.678
No, I don't think so.

30:23.718 --> 30:24.440
Not really.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.989
Not to say, you know, nobody said, oh, just don't take that course.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.773
I don't believe that's true.

30:29.990 --> 30:36.299
All right, during all of these years, what was the job market for a freshman undergraduate major in chemistry?

30:36.779 --> 30:41.846
What did freshman chemist, I mean... I mean a BS chemist.

30:41.906 --> 30:43.448
What kind of jobs did they get?

30:43.628 --> 30:46.793
Well, until the last year or two, it was very good.

30:47.093 --> 30:48.715
I mean, just availability was good.

30:48.735 --> 30:58.208
Where would they... Most commonly with an industrial company, and most commonly in a research or development laboratory.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.973
But the jobs were available.

31:00.013 --> 31:02.278
I understand lately it's kind of tapered off.

31:02.960 --> 31:13.602
Well you know we've had this economic slowdown and companies apparently are reluctant to, the hiring of an employee is terribly expensive.

31:14.805 --> 31:16.669
Terribly expensive.

31:16.970 --> 31:23.380
doctoral students about what percentage of them went into academics and what percentage into industry?

31:23.400 --> 31:26.264
Well, the overwhelming majority went into industry.

31:26.464 --> 31:27.566
Into industry?

31:28.147 --> 31:28.327
Yeah.

31:28.788 --> 31:31.873
Heck, I'd say 10% maybe into academics.

31:31.893 --> 31:33.375
And their salary?
