WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:03.836
Nobody could enter this door. The guard wouldn't 
let them. Without calling. Without me calling him

00:08.242 --> 00:11.206
on the phone to get permission to come in. But this 
time he called. I was his office right next door to

00:13.629 --> 00:16.833
him. But there was no door from my office directly 
in. I had to come out in the hallway to get to his

00:19.657 --> 00:22.360
door.

00:28.313 --> 00:28.934
He called me. I came in, and as I entered the door, he 
was staying in the middle of the room. He drew

00:34.200 --> 00:44.512
himself up straight and so straight that he 
actually bent over backwards in a very arrogant,

00:34.200 --> 00:44.512
accusative manner. General Bond, why are you 
disciplining my orders? I said, what do you mean,

00:49.177 --> 00:53.983
disciplining your orders, General?

00:54.841 --> 01:03.689
I told you I didn't want you coming up in the front of 
this building, and you've been doing it for the

00:54.841 --> 01:03.689
last week. And I guess that's the closest I came to 
going on. And I just took a step forward towards

01:07.473 --> 01:22.366
him, and I took my hand and said, I will never park in 
front of your building again, General, and turn

01:07.473 --> 01:22.366
around and walk down. That's the closest I ever 
came to insulting a general, whether it's

01:24.524 --> 01:30.573
American, foreigner, or anybody. I never talked 
to a superior like that. Turned around and walked

01:32.956 --> 01:33.798
out. Matter of fact, I went to my office, put my cap 
on, and went home. I was just furious. Of course,

01:40.468 --> 01:41.830
settled down. And never heard any more about 
David. And where'd you park? Oh, I parked in the

01:45.175 --> 01:46.496
back. I didn't want to cause any more trouble. And I 
determined that I just wouldn't I would not see

01:54.713 --> 02:02.404
General Bianchi any more than I had to then on. Did 
you report this to your general? No, no, not

02:05.970 --> 02:07.532
officially, no. I later on told him the story. I'll 
tell you more about this later on. I had a talk with

02:12.119 --> 02:13.341
him once. But it's things of this nature. The way he 
talked to my men is insulting.

02:23.097 --> 02:26.440
ironic, satirical remarks. Is there an American 
officer here that can do this? Gentlemen, would

02:30.924 --> 02:36.669
you stand up and speak in American English to your 
officers so they understand my instructions?

02:36.689 --> 02:37.850
This type of thing. Really? Oh. Well, that's 
enough of that. We're taking too much time. But I

02:42.855 --> 02:51.282
can assure you that it was one of the hardest jobs I 
have ever had in my life. Three years? Three years.

02:52.696 --> 03:04.491
I took on

02:52.696 --> 03:04.491
a little

02:52.696 --> 03:04.491
project at home, building a model house. I 
concentrated on physical therapy, you know,

03:04.952 --> 03:14.585
walked at night, getting in shape, exercising, 
anything to get my mind off of my job. He would call

03:16.187 --> 03:22.635
me in at times and we'd have staff meetings and I was 
polite, he was polite. These things didn't show up

03:23.122 --> 03:26.905
except at the Freeport Times. His underling 
officers, the lower-ranking Italian officers,

03:28.667 --> 03:34.412
had a great deal of respect for him. They all knew 
the type of General Bianchi was, and they were

03:34.432 --> 03:40.318
absolutely scared to death of him. I have never 
seen officers so scared of a commander as that. I

03:45.622 --> 03:49.686
have never seen those. Just in utter fear when he 
spoke to them. The man had some reasons for being

03:55.538 --> 03:59.002
this way, I'm sure. First, he had severe glaucoma 
and was blind in one eye. I'm sure this is one reason

04:04.589 --> 04:08.414
that he didn't go any further in his military 
career. Now, this is all in defense of General

04:08.814 --> 04:11.878
Bianchi. His wife, I loved her and felt so sorry for 
her. She was German and just as sweet as she could

04:15.623 --> 04:17.765
be. You'd never know that she lived with a man of 
this temperament. I've seen him actually, you

04:23.399 --> 04:29.684
know, act around her as though he insulted her. He 
didn't act like a gentleman around her. You know,

04:31.006 --> 04:34.549
she'd call him around like a little puppy, this 
type of thing. I'm spending too much time on this.

04:38.072 --> 04:38.372
Anyway. Tell me about the time that you finally 
told your commanding officer.

04:44.898 --> 04:47.340
This was about after two years. Incidentally, 
when General, very few times would the F. South

04:53.302 --> 05:06.295
Commander, a four-star United States Navy 
Admiral, very few times would he ever come up and

04:53.302 --> 05:06.295
visit us at 5-8 Taff. Only one or two times did 
General Swafford ever come up and visit 5-8 Taff,

05:07.356 --> 05:18.808
and we just didn't have many visitors at all, and it 
was all because of the personality of this man. He

05:18.848 --> 05:23.292
was well known to be this type of person. 
Effectiveness reports. Final effectiveness

05:27.150 --> 05:34.559
report when I was reassigned from, oh, about a 
year, you know, each year I had to have one. It was a

05:34.579 --> 05:43.510
year before I was reassigned, and I'm sure it had a 
lot to do with my being promoted to a major general

05:34.579 --> 05:43.510
in, still in that position when I retired. It's the 
only time an American general, Air Force, or NATO

05:43.850 --> 05:53.582
that I know of, and I was told, was promoted from 
brigadier general to a major general. It was the

05:54.170 --> 06:08.746
only time that a Brigadier General assigned to 
NATO was given a second star in that position. He

06:08.846 --> 06:12.630
had called for a Brigadier General. Do you feel 
that was because of the fact that you could relate?

06:17.255 --> 06:20.599
I'm going to tell you what this was.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.126
I saw my effectiveness report. General Swofford 
sent me a copy of it when he sent it in at the end of the

06:25.146 --> 06:29.052
second year. And it had to be endorsed by the Navy 
AFSAL commander because he was the chain of

06:29.833 --> 06:34.881
command. They took it. And it so happened this was 
the United States four-star athlete. And his

06:39.888 --> 06:49.042
remarks just on the endorsement was, I agree 
absolutely with everything General Swofford

06:39.888 --> 06:49.042
says about General Bond. And of course, it was 
outstanding. It topped right down the right-hand

06:50.524 --> 06:52.527
side. And his last sentence, we are indeed 
fortunate that we have a man like General Bond in

06:53.350 --> 07:01.967
this position in 5th ATF. He knew what the 
situation was. The chief of staff of 5th ATF under

07:05.493 --> 07:13.168
General Swofford was an Italian major general, 
whom I learned to love. And he would ask me

07:13.749 --> 07:15.232
questions. He says, Bond, they never call you by 
your first name in Italy. It's always, Bond, how is

07:19.057 --> 07:21.800
life up at 5-8-10? And I said, well, they did much 
better. And he'd laugh and put his arm on me and

07:24.103 --> 07:26.986
said, I understand. But he said, you know, these 
things will change. He knew what I was getting at.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.854
It was well known. And I was given full credit by 
General Swartford and General and Admiral,

07:34.314 --> 07:45.126
Admiral Russell, for keeping my mouth and my 
temper, I'm sure. I am convinced no other journal

07:46.861 --> 07:50.286
was put up by him. I'm convinced of it. And that's 
the reason this other journal that I relieved, he

07:52.270 --> 07:55.354
had to leave. He wouldn't even talk to this man. He 
wouldn't even talk to him. And it just couldn't go.

08:00.182 --> 08:01.224
I mean, you had to get rid of him. What happened to 
that man? He wasn't reduced in rank or anything.

08:04.349 --> 08:06.432
They just sent him back home, gave him another job. 
He knew what the situation was. But at any rate, I

08:08.714 --> 08:13.261
was, we had a NATO. Well, tell me about when you 
talked to the general. I am. I'm going to tell you

08:15.664 --> 08:16.445
right now. We had a NATO conference of shape up at 
Wiesbaden, Germany. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Wiesbaden,

08:24.697 --> 08:25.839
Germany. No, at Ramstein with ATF. Okay. And had a 
meeting there. And, of course, this was all the key

08:32.829 --> 08:35.954
generals. General Bianchi did not go. He wouldn't 
go. He was supposed to go to this conference. He

08:39.929 --> 08:40.570
wouldn't go. He sent me. It was beneath his dignity 
to go to this meeting. That's the way he looked at

08:45.877 --> 08:46.918
it. He wouldn't go. And I

08:48.580 --> 08:53.126
went. And that night, you know, General Crawford 
had heard things, I'm sure. And that night, as we

09:00.115 --> 09:07.425
come back to her after one of the dinner's social 
John said, come on in and have a drink. I went in.

09:09.949 --> 09:12.671
John said, how you getting along up there? I said, 
well, John said, sometimes it gets pretty rough.

09:15.894 --> 09:16.975
He says, I think I know what you mean. He said, tell 
me about it. And I said, well, John, I'll tell you. I

09:22.400 --> 09:24.782
said, this man, John, will be honest. He is, 
without a doubt, close to being me. I just laid my

09:27.625 --> 09:31.168
hair down and told him, without a doubt, this man is 
a typical bossess. And I said, there's no doubt he

09:31.308 --> 09:33.150
hates America. He said, well, I've heard a lot of 
stories about this. He says, tell me. He asked me

09:37.712 --> 09:39.615
questions like, what does he do? How does he act? 
And I told him. And I called to his attention. I

09:43.662 --> 09:49.832
said, you remember when you visited

09:43.662 --> 09:49.832
ATAP about a month ago? You remember you came up and 
he first picked you up in the car. And then we rode

09:54.359 --> 09:56.783
over to the club. I mean, where the headquarters 
were. They're going to put you up. And... You

10:01.169 --> 10:09.697
reached in to get your bag out of the back of the car, 
you know, and he reached in and said, oh, no, we'll

10:01.169 --> 10:09.697
have your bag taken care of, General Swofford, you 
don't need to do that. And I said, I distinctly

10:09.717 --> 10:14.781
remember that you looked at him and reached in and 
said, I'll take care of my own bag. That's what

10:15.943 --> 10:17.164
General Swofford did. He laughed. You know what I 
mean? I said, now this stone is what I have to put up

10:19.005 --> 10:22.388
with. I said, I let him know that, you know, I 
realized he knew what I was doing. And General

10:28.034 --> 10:30.636
Swofford, he listened to me for a while. And I told 
him about some of the colonels under me that were

10:31.578 --> 10:35.823
being reassigned. You know, the tour was over and 
all. They had stories with me, and they literally

10:37.765 --> 10:41.269
despised the man. And it was a hard job really to put 
up with this gentleman. And all I'm saying, I don't

10:45.353 --> 10:47.455
see how you do it. I don't see how you do it. But that 
decided the point. But General Swofford asked

10:50.318 --> 10:54.483
this guy, and he said, well, try this. I'll tell you 
what. He said, I can reassign you if you want me to.

10:57.967 --> 11:00.910
And he knew that I was having this hard time. And I 
don't know, I may have shown him the face that I was,

11:01.582 --> 11:05.929
you know, it's too much of a struggling emotion. He 
said, I can have you reassigned if you want to. And

11:08.052 --> 11:14.562
he, nothing but from the standpoint of demoting 
me, but, you know, just, you know, relieving me of

11:08.052 --> 11:14.562
this horrible experience. And you've already had 
it for two years? Yeah. And I said, no. I said, I can

11:18.428 --> 11:19.650
handle it. I said, I don't want to be reassigned. I 
said, I can handle this job. I'll take it. I said, I

11:23.335 --> 11:25.359
don't want you reassigned. He said, okay. And I 
stayed with him. Until your three-year tour was

11:28.985 --> 11:30.086
over? Well, fortunately, he didn't stay there. 
After a little over two years, he was replaced by a

11:34.732 --> 11:46.387
completely opposite type of a general.

11:46.407 --> 11:47.929
Lieutenant, I mean, he's a major gentleman. He's 
got his third story. He was a diplomat in

11:48.950 --> 11:52.294
completely the other extremes. And I only had 
another year to go, a little less than another year

11:52.679 --> 11:58.785
to go, so I was going to have a fine job, and I knew I 
had to be rotated. But a terrific man, and he fully

11:58.805 --> 12:04.011
understood what the situation was. And it was a, it 
was a, the change of command ceremony was really a,

12:04.592 --> 12:22.230
it was something to behold, and there was a lot of 
mixed emotions, submerged emotions of elation

12:04.592 --> 12:22.230
that this guy was leaving. No, Bianchi? Bianchi 
was leaving, yeah. Oh, okay, so after two years

12:26.596 --> 12:29.920
then Bianchi was reassigned. Right, and there was 
quite a lot of speculation on his part. He was

12:34.866 --> 12:39.051
hoping he'd be made Chief of Staff of the Italian 
Air Force, but he wasn't. He was put in a major

12:39.352 --> 12:51.947
supply position in Rome, Italy, outside of the 
NATO organization, but strictly in the Italian

12:39.352 --> 12:51.947
Air Force. a shelf assignment for him in his last 
tour, I suppose. But it was definitely, I'm sure

12:58.614 --> 13:06.342
that it broke the old boy's heart, but didn't break 
his spirit any. Right through the change of

13:06.422 --> 13:11.128
command ceremony, he was still the same type. You 
were happy to see him? Oh, was I ever happy to see

13:12.489 --> 13:15.172
him. So you had one more year with a man who was a- 
Very fine person. Oh, okay. Very fine. Okay, now

13:20.108 --> 13:28.358
there's a number of questions that I want to ask you 
about this 1960-1963 NATO assignment.

13:28.818 --> 13:34.665
One is, when were nuclear weapons put in, given to 
NATO? Do you remember? Oh, they were there when I

13:35.426 --> 13:39.010
got there in 1960. Do you remember when they were 
put in? Did I get there in 59?

13:46.568 --> 13:47.890
You arrived there in October 1960. Yeah, 1960. Oh 
yeah, you had nuclear capabilities in Italy. Your

13:54.537 --> 13:55.418
airplanes did. No, not to tell you an Air Force 
airplane, but we had under our operational

13:56.660 --> 14:14.500
control a rotating flight of United States Air 
Force Tactical Air Command F-100s at Aviano Air

13:56.660 --> 14:14.500
Force Base in northern Italy. that were good 
nuclear alerts to us, a little nuclear alert all

14:15.087 --> 14:21.693
the time. Now, let's say we had operational 
command of it. We didn't give orders for the

14:24.796 --> 14:30.101
takeoff of those type of airplanes or conduct 
their training. That was done under the commander

14:30.161 --> 14:36.567
of the United States Air Forces of Europe. It was 
strictly a United States Air Force set up that we

14:36.587 --> 14:42.272
spun headquarters. So it wasn't NATO? No, well, 
the training and responsibility was not NATO, but

14:43.538 --> 15:02.902
the operational command, and let's say the 
ordering them on a mission, was the NATO job, which

14:43.538 --> 15:02.902
was still the United States Air Force commander at 
that time, General, was it Norstad? So NATO, so in

15:04.023 --> 15:11.192
other words, well, the Supreme Commander of NATO 
is an American. That's right. That's right, and he

15:11.973 --> 15:18.239
has control of the atomic nuclear arsenal. Now, 
let's talk about the quality of the force, the

15:20.241 --> 15:33.795
quality of the Italians that you were working 
with, the quality of the Air Force in your area.

15:33.815 --> 15:41.102
Well,

15:33.815 --> 15:41.102
in the first place, The Italian Air Force was 
manned with old F-84 aircraft. In fact, obsolete

15:46.854 --> 15:49.377
aircraft. Sure, yeah. The 84 Sabre jets? No, no, 
that's the F-86. Oh, yeah. It's an old

15:53.843 --> 15:56.967
Thunderbird, I think you call it. It's a thud, if 
you ever will. Okay. That's an expression we use.

16:01.693 --> 16:05.478
Don't get me mixed up with the F-105 thud, but this 
airplane was a thud. Okay. Just, you know,

16:06.138 --> 16:07.660
outdated. Okay. Actually...

16:13.043 --> 16:33.444
The range and performance capability of the 
aircraft, the 84s that the Italian Air Force had,

16:13.043 --> 16:33.444
quite frankly, I wonder if they even could get to 
their targets across the mountains over into,

16:13.043 --> 16:33.444
let's say, Romania and that area, and maybe into 
Yugoslavia, or should we be involved in something

16:13.043 --> 16:33.444
like that. But they had also one squadron of 
Italian-built tactical aircraft, what do they

16:33.464 --> 16:40.992
call it? It was an Italian-built airplane, and it 
was jet. Now these don't jet aircraft, but it had

16:49.279 --> 16:54.568
the performance of a P-40. They were equipped very 
poorly, definitely inferior equipment, and I was

16:56.632 --> 17:08.532
hoping during the time I was over there that maybe 
we could get better equipment, maybe F-100s, you

16:56.632 --> 17:08.532
know. We did, and they had a troop carrier group of 
C-119, a horrible airplane. But crew-wise,

17:16.588 --> 17:26.921
generally speaking, the crews with the equipment 
they had, I think they did a good job. They

17:27.141 --> 17:28.223
certainly tried. And morale-wise, their morale 
was good. They had more of a happy-go-lucky

17:33.925 --> 17:49.199
attitude towards life, you know, typical 
Italians, and we Americans, they seemed, I don't

17:33.925 --> 17:49.199
know, they just didn't strike me as being 
dedicated to the task as much as a typical American

17:33.925 --> 17:49.199
would call it. If there was an attack from the 
Eastern Bloc countries

17:49.720 --> 18:03.713
in Italy, where was your major objective, your 
targeting objective?

18:04.267 --> 18:23.948
The only ones they had in the Air Forces was these 
Aviano-based F-100s under the command of the

18:04.267 --> 18:23.948
United States Air Force commander, who were then 
reported to NATO shape commanders. And they had

18:24.428 --> 18:26.871
their specific targets. Actually, we didn't even 
get into that planning. Well, what about a

18:28.813 --> 18:31.135
mission? the Eastern Bloc started to move west. 
Well, you're close to the border of Yugoslavia.

18:38.053 --> 18:39.255
What was your mission? We were prepared, quite 
frankly, it's a good question. All you have to do is

18:42.760 --> 18:44.643
look at the map. Sure. And down in Italy, really the 
forces that Air South looked for and did the most

18:45.264 --> 18:58.025
critical thing was the 6th ATF, Turkey and Greece. 
Mm-hmm. You look at the map, and you've asked me

18:58.655 --> 19:04.544
questions that I used to ask myself. Are we in an air 
defense role? And quite frankly, we were. As a

19:08.470 --> 19:19.246
matter of fact, it so turned out that they learned 
about my air defense background, General Bianchi

19:08.470 --> 19:19.246
asked me, but in fact directed me, to prepare an air 
defense plan for all of Italy. I sat down and did

19:19.266 --> 19:21.269
that while I was over there. I prepared the air 
defense plan. Here are those clunkers. F84 they'd

19:25.435 --> 19:27.658
use for air defense. But should the invasion come 
on over, we could get above the Alps, and maybe into

19:27.678 --> 19:46.660
Austria area, and we could get over into 
Yugoslavia, and maybe even get a mission over into

19:27.678 --> 19:46.660
Hungary or Romania. But if we got into Romania, 
they'd never made it back. So it's a good question

19:50.905 --> 19:53.248
to ask. So really, it's an air defense posture, 
quite frankly. And it so turned out that... Defend

19:57.208 --> 19:59.992
Eastern Italy. That's right. Well, defend Italy. 
Now, the Army, and support the Italian Army, but

20:02.154 --> 20:10.224
again, you ask the question, against what? Now, 
the Italian Army would be on the ground with tanks

20:10.244 --> 20:19.676
and all, well, they're going to have to wait until 
the Russians get over there where they can get

20:10.244 --> 20:19.676
striking distance of them, if you will. Sure. 
So...

20:23.182 --> 20:32.950
But now they did have the Army, the Italian Army had 
a regiment of Honest John's, a new character. Of

20:33.010 --> 20:40.677
course, it was controlled by the American Honest 
John outfit.

20:40.837 --> 20:46.142
And they had a range, but quite frankly, those at 
that time were almost out of the league. I think the

20:46.162 --> 20:47.703
range was 75 miles. What were they going to get from 
the emplacements in Italy? So it's another

20:51.186 --> 20:52.227
question. So the main brunt of the NATO force was 
probably, still is today, Germany. Oh, Central.

21:01.216 --> 21:01.857
Absent. Central for sure. Historic, it's only 
sure. Now, they've made probably some naval

21:06.604 --> 21:19.362
operations, but that's the reason that there was 
another command in the Mediterranean, the Malta,

21:06.604 --> 21:19.362
which was strictly a naval, a British naval 
command, plus the naval forces, the United States

21:19.848 --> 21:33.088
Navy primarily, with Italian, Greek, and Turkish 
navies integrated under Navy South, NAV South.

21:33.108 --> 21:36.854
And of course their mission would be toward 
Istanbul. Oh yeah, fictive naval warfare. And you

21:40.079 --> 21:42.442
don't have a carrier there too. But if you look back 
now, strictly the Italian

21:50.780 --> 22:07.847
The Italian Armed Forces and NATO then, as far as I 
see from an employment standpoint, is picking one

21:50.780 --> 22:07.847
of their defense and politically being part of 
NATO. How about cooperation on maneuvers? It must

22:10.652 --> 22:15.960
have gone out with maneuvers with other NATO 
countries. How good were the maneuvers? Did the

22:19.116 --> 22:21.979
people cooperate? The only joint maneuvers we had 
was air defense maneuvers, communication across

22:22.240 --> 22:31.532
the Alps with the 4th ATF to pass early warning to 
one another. And actually, we even tried to work up

22:32.092 --> 22:43.667
joint air defense procedures across the border 
into France with the French air defense command.

22:43.807 --> 22:45.930
And I actually made trips over there and 
coordinating such operations. And we worked out

22:48.349 --> 22:56.643
the procedures, but you didn't have much for joint 
maneuvers. Now, we had joint maneuvers with the

22:58.707 --> 23:11.108
Italian Army all the time, you know, supporting 
them and tanks advancing across the Italian

22:58.707 --> 23:11.108
countryside where they could along the 
mountainous roads. Italian Air Force 84 is flying

23:11.324 --> 23:18.534
over and supporting them and giving them 
protection and all that type of stuff. Yeah, we had

23:18.554 --> 23:19.375
that. And, you know, did the best. We had a hole in 
the mountain for 5th ATF Command Air Control

23:20.818 --> 23:31.012
Center, but again, see, it was air defense. Sure.

23:35.559 --> 23:40.065
Compared to many of your other assignments, this 
sounds pretty dull. It was. You're right. Not only

23:42.962 --> 23:48.170
dull, but for the first two years, miserable. Now, 
you were here about the same time France was

23:48.190 --> 23:52.957
pulling out of NATO. No, I came home just about that 
time, I believe. I think that happened right after

23:57.584 --> 23:59.848
I came home. Yeah.

24:06.878 --> 24:09.462
I don't even think de Gaulle was president at that 
time, was he? I'm not sure. I'm sorry. I thought it

24:13.255 --> 24:19.683
was 63.

24:20.104 --> 24:26.452
No, as a matter of fact, I remember visiting NATO 
headquarters in Paris, outside of Paris.

24:30.918 --> 24:33.381
I think it was shortly after I left. Okay, well. 
How'd you get along with the French? What little I

24:40.002 --> 24:45.932
communicated with them and did air defense 
planning with them, I got along with them all

24:40.002 --> 24:45.932
right. They weren't hard to deal with. They 
weren't too interested in dealing with Italians.

24:53.003 --> 24:56.849
They were more interested in talking to me than 
they were Italians. Greeks I loved. What little

24:58.852 --> 25:05.283
relations I had with them mainly died when I'd go 
down to Naples and visit Air South. The Turks I

25:05.984 --> 25:07.326
loved. The Italian people, I literally love. The 
lower-ranking Italians, and generally

25:12.353 --> 25:17.222
speaking, most of the Italian Air Force officers, 
I love. They're great. I just didn't like my boss.

25:21.610 --> 25:25.056
In 1963, you were awarded your second star. What 
was your feeling on that? When I learned that, I was

25:27.460 --> 25:31.187
visiting...

25:36.533 --> 25:47.028
Air Force headquarters in the Pentagon, and I was 
with General Swofford, and the promotion list, I

25:36.533 --> 25:47.028
was sitting in the visiting general's office. I 
knew the list was about to be published, and

25:48.009 --> 26:05.494
General Swofford had never said a word to me, but he 
was sitting in the outer office, reserved for

25:48.009 --> 26:05.494
visiting generals, going over some papers, and I 
was sitting inside by the secretary, you know,

25:48.009 --> 26:05.494
waiting for him, and Uh, in walked a Colonel from 
Chief Staff's Office right down the hall, and he

26:05.862 --> 26:16.031
had the new, brand new Promotion List, Major 
General Brigadier General gave it to the

26:05.862 --> 26:16.031
Secretary. And, uh, she, she didn't, she knew who I 
was, but she didn't know anything about whether

26:17.152 --> 26:26.880
I'd be on this or not, and she said, maybe you'd be 
interested in this. I said, do come on in. I said,

26:28.061 --> 26:29.382
you bet I'm interested in it. Can I see one of those? 
And I grabbed it and made it go down there with

26:31.524 --> 26:35.768
Charles Arbonne Jr. Actually, I felt great. I 
immediately turned around, and I didn't even care

26:38.384 --> 26:45.433
what John Swofford was doing or how involved he was 
with the paper writing thing. I just walked into

26:45.453 --> 26:48.737
him and put my hand out. And I said, thank you very 
much, John Swofford. He looked at me. I said, I just

26:52.582 --> 26:53.903
got emotional. He said, oh. He says, well, 
congratulations. He says, I knew it. And then I

26:58.268 --> 27:00.491
showed it to him. And I turned around and walked 
out. And of course, Doris and the kid were still

27:01.773 --> 27:05.417
back in Italy. And I don't remember, naturally I 
was happy and elated, and

27:06.022 --> 27:34.341
maybe I was a little bit surprised, but I remember 
reading that OER, and the officer's perspective

27:06.022 --> 27:34.341
report where the admiral made that comment, and 
again, I

27:06.022 --> 27:34.341
was a little surprised, but To a certain extent, I 
must admit, maybe egotistically, but I did kind of

27:35.198 --> 27:41.506
expect it. And I had about another six or eight 
months to go, and I was going to be reassigned at the

27:41.786 --> 27:48.215
end of the three-year tour. But later on, General 
Swofford or somebody made that comment to me that I

27:49.276 --> 27:54.783
told you a moment ago. It's the first time I think he 
said his first time Brigadier General in this

27:56.832 --> 28:05.081
position, in the Air Force position, has ever been 
promoted to a Major General on the spot. So that was

28:06.282 --> 28:08.084
quite a compliment to me. At least I took it that 
way. And after that, of course, the Italian

28:10.726 --> 28:23.920
General,

28:10.726 --> 28:23.920
I replaced General Bianchi with my boss. when I 
came back and arrived at the airport. As a matter of

28:26.804 --> 28:30.609
fact, they met me at the airplane to congratulate 
me. And all the other colonels and generals in the

28:30.789 --> 28:37.398
Italian Air Force knew about it by then, you know, 
where it got back to then. Of course, my wife knew

28:37.438 --> 28:39.601
it. So, as a matter of fact, I stepped off the 
airplane with two stars. No kidding. They let you

28:44.768 --> 28:46.470
wear two stars back? Yeah. Well, it was effective, 
I think, practically the day they put out the list.

28:50.455 --> 28:51.156
Effective for me. I forget how it was, but two or 
three days, you know, is the time we got back.

29:02.598 --> 29:03.679
First of July of 63.

29:07.444 --> 29:08.766
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. First of July of 63, and in August 
of 63, you were, you switched, you left Italy, were

29:11.269 --> 29:18.799
you happy to go? Oh, yeah. And you went to Shaw Air 
Force Base where you were the Deputy Commander of

29:21.848 --> 29:26.575
the 9th Air Force. And you stayed there for three 
years. Right.

29:34.786 --> 29:35.988
Oh, almost three years. I forget the date. Yeah. 
Well, from August 1963 to January 1966.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.923
What were your responsibilities there? Well, 
Deputy Commander, Under the Commander, At first

29:50.232 --> 30:19.075
it was General Koerner, C-O-Y-N-E-R, and it was 
that time that General Sweeney was commander of

29:50.232 --> 30:19.075
TAC, the SAC General, that used to be, I think, his 
chief of staff, the vice commander of SAC, and for

29:50.232 --> 30:19.075
some reason or another they decided to assign him, 
give him TAC, Tactical Aircraft.

30:19.544 --> 30:43.240
deputy commander of 9th, and my relations, the 
command channel of course went to General Sweeney

30:19.544 --> 30:43.240
and General Corner, so normally all the 
relationships between those two, but I learned to

30:19.544 --> 30:43.240
know General Sweeney as the vice commander of 9th 
Air Force, and that's where we got in a lot of joint

30:19.544 --> 30:43.240
training exercises some very big and expensive 
exercises with the United States Army and where we

30:43.912 --> 31:07.004
got involved in a lot of controversial 
discussions with the United States Army as to how

30:43.912 --> 31:07.004
we support them and who would have helicopters and 
troop lifts and air carriers, this type of stuff.

31:07.024 --> 31:12.773
There was a big problem here on helicopters 
between the Army and the Air Force. Can you explain

31:13.013 --> 31:13.834
that? Yes, the Army had their helicopters and we 
had our helicopters and the Army was operating

31:14.152 --> 31:40.687
with the idea that they were going to equip and 
build and design and deploy helicopters armed

31:14.152 --> 31:40.687
with such nature that they would really take over 
air support and give direct air support to their

31:14.152 --> 31:40.687
troops when this was rightfully by roles and 
missions of the United States Air Force. So

31:40.707 --> 31:42.589
really, the roles and missions was the 
controversial thing at that time between the Air

31:43.447 --> 31:50.616
Force and the United States Army, and I was right in 
the middle of this. And in the many exercises we

31:51.417 --> 31:56.143
had, I have to give General Sweeney full credit for 
it. He was instrumental. It might very well be

31:57.484 --> 32:00.968
that's the reason he was assigned the job. He was a 
very adamant, demanding, martinet-type,

32:01.649 --> 32:12.863
ruthless general. far more, in my opinion, than 
General LeMay, and I'm sure that a lot of this

32:13.602 --> 32:32.206
so-called ruthlessness of General LeMay at SAC 
really stemmed from this man, I feel, because he

32:13.602 --> 32:32.206
exhibited as a commander of TAC.

32:36.852 --> 32:38.774
In his dealings with the Army? In his dealings with 
the Army, he was a dynamic man who wouldn't, you

32:44.112 --> 33:12.735
know, it wouldn't take no for an answer, and this is 
my job, and I could very well be that's the reason he

32:44.112 --> 33:12.735
was put in there, because we were having a very hard 
time with the Army and maintaining our position

32:44.112 --> 33:12.735
that ground direct air support is an Air Force 
mission, and you shouldn't have what's now known

32:44.112 --> 33:12.735
as attack helicopters with missiles on them, 
guns, and so forth, and you shouldn't do your local

33:13.171 --> 33:14.873
tactical reconnaissance. We do that and so forth. 
So that's one reason we had all these exercises and

33:16.876 --> 33:41.170
that's one reason that the so-called STRYCOM

33:16.876 --> 33:41.170
command was organized, Strike Forces was 
organized and set up as a joint

33:16.876 --> 33:41.170
tactical force at met at the MacDill Air Force Base 
in Florida, in Tampa, Florida, where an Army

33:41.470 --> 33:59.216
commander was commanding it, and he had a deputy 
who was an Air Force commander, and on the

33:41.470 --> 33:59.216
exercises that the Army and the Air Force would 
have, see, he would command them. Therefore, he

33:59.236 --> 34:11.173
would be the umpire and the referee, let's say, 
about the developing joint tactics for support of

33:59.236 --> 34:11.173
the ground forces and the Air Force and the Army 
operating together. And to make a long story

34:12.048 --> 34:16.696
short, we had a lot of exercise and a lot of TDY. And 
it so turned out that your old Charlie Bond was

34:17.417 --> 34:27.233
always tabbed by one General Sweeney as the Air 
Force component commander of those exercises.

34:27.253 --> 34:29.437
And this is where...

34:33.243 --> 34:33.724
I don't know. I have a feeling that I said, I don't 
possibly know. He never did tell me except that I

34:40.565 --> 34:45.431
got the impression from him he just thought that I 
was good at it. Nobody else could do it any better

34:45.451 --> 34:47.774
than I could. Plus the fact that he knew I knew 
tactical air warfare. A lot of ways I had almost

34:56.286 --> 35:01.072
written a book, if you will, in a lot of ways. And he 
knew I was dependable. I think he knew I didn't

35:06.239 --> 35:08.582
particularly care because the first, just go back 
a little, the first job I ever was given when I was

35:09.642 --> 35:28.292
assigned to that job as vice commander in 9th Air 
Force was they had a terrible accident down at

35:09.642 --> 35:28.292
Eglin Air Force Base by one of the outfits where we 
were making rocket attacks on some targets

35:28.897 --> 35:34.404
directed by a forward air controller, exercises, 
you know, developing tactics. And the airplane

35:34.825 --> 35:53.210
came around and fired its rockets into the 
controller's

35:34.825 --> 35:53.210
position and killed one of the pilots there who 
was, you know, supposed to be the controller and

35:34.825 --> 35:53.210
marked the target. And they were investigating 
the accident. I hadn't been to Kamehameha in two

35:56.354 --> 35:58.397
weeks. I got a call from Chief of Staff at TAC that 
General Sweeney wants you to head up this accident

35:59.542 --> 36:06.472
investigation board. And I headed it up, and I 
wrote it exactly the way I saw it, and it was

36:06.492 --> 36:19.993
critical of training procedures conducted by the 
Tactical Air Command, which of course was

36:06.492 --> 36:19.993
interpreted as critical for General Sweeney, and 
he didn't like it. And I think... What did he say to

36:20.013 --> 36:24.219
you about it? He had read it one day when I was 
visiting, Well, actually, I was supposed to visit

36:26.626 --> 36:31.751
him, you know, and talk to him at his office about 
the report. When they called me into the office, we

36:32.272 --> 36:37.077
sat down and he looked at it the minute he'd read it 
all. He dropped it on the table and said, Charlie,

36:37.097 --> 36:41.862
I've got some business coming in. He says, I'm not 
going to be able to talk to you about this. In other

36:45.026 --> 36:46.547
words, he was dismissing me. He didn't want to talk 
to me. But it was a little bit accusative of the...

36:55.955 --> 37:04.725
the way General Sweeney had put people down there 
who, in my opinion, were not properly trained to do

36:55.955 --> 37:04.725
this mission, and that's exactly the reason this 
accident occurred. Lack of supervision and

37:06.447 --> 37:09.311
proper training. And at that time, General LeMay 
was Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Now, I don't

37:12.515 --> 37:13.756
know whatever happened. General LeMay knew me. 
And there was my accident. There was a report

37:17.000 --> 37:19.803
signed by Charles R. Bond. I never heard anything 
from anybody. And it went right to LeMay? Oh, sure,

37:24.901 --> 37:27.645
it had to go, sure, you know, Chief of Staff. And he 
read it? Well, if he didn't read it, I'm sure he was

37:29.528 --> 37:37.280
briefed on it, and I'm convinced to this day that he 
knew that Charlie Bond was investigating him. He

37:37.300 --> 37:42.969
had to know that, because the Chief of Safety and 
the Chief of Staff had to brief him. Sure. It was a

37:43.110 --> 37:45.073
nasty accident. But anyway, I don't know, 
maybe...

37:52.537 --> 37:54.239
He kept me on TV all the time. It darn near caused a 
divorce in my family. Because you were always

37:57.323 --> 37:58.204
gone? I was always gone. I remember specifically 
at the end of one joint training exercise we had at

38:01.808 --> 38:08.737
Eglin Air Force called Indian River. He got 
through with everything. The exercise was

38:10.439 --> 38:13.803
supposed to be over, and I said, well, I'll be going 
back tomorrow. And he said, last thing you stated.

38:15.585 --> 38:19.450
But Charlie said, I want you to stay down. That's 
all he said. I don't even remember making a

38:22.827 --> 38:31.881
comment, but to me it was, I took it as, I just took it 
hard. When did you ever get to see your wife? Oh

38:36.127 --> 38:42.997
yeah, as a matter of fact, my wife, I was gone so much 
that I made arrangements to have her come down and

38:36.127 --> 38:42.997
visit me with the kids. One time I flew up, got 
permission to fly a driver down. But that's, I did

38:47.203 --> 38:51.670
a, I did a I did a commendable job. I must have 
because I was continually put back in charge of all

38:54.557 --> 39:06.274
the Air Force forces in these joint exercises and I 
was well respected by my counterparts in the Army

38:54.557 --> 39:06.274
and we got along well. It was terrific experience. 
But here again, you know, the idea to keep a vice

39:10.360 --> 39:15.768
commander occupied, I guess, so I accepted it. But 
it was hard, but I did it. Concerning the

39:20.101 --> 39:26.208
helicopters, especially the Army use of 
helicopters in Vietnam, who won that battle?

39:26.268 --> 39:32.695
Well, today, you know, the Army has attack 
helicopters armed, but the roles and missions

39:26.268 --> 39:32.695
haven't changed. The United States Air Force, in 
the form of attack and alert command, still has a

39:32.715 --> 39:40.745
mission of direct air support of the United States 
Army. It's sort of compromised. It's getting to be

39:44.869 --> 39:48.133
where in modern technology, you know, that... 
It's difficult to draw a line between what is

39:48.299 --> 40:10.789
tactical and strategic and what is,

39:48.299 --> 40:10.789
let's say, an Army weapon by nature and role of 
mission and what's an Air Force weapon by nature

39:48.299 --> 40:10.789
and role of mission. Photography, 
reconnaissance, night and day, it's getting

40:10.909 --> 40:16.416
complex. But again, I think the way the roles and 
missions are written, I think they're still

40:17.189 --> 40:25.139
solid. Were you upset to see the Army have such an 
increase of helicopter power during the Vietnam

40:25.159 --> 40:34.171
era?

40:35.252 --> 40:35.512
No. As a matter of fact, over in Vietnam, to a great 
extent, I think the Army was justified in getting

40:35.833 --> 40:43.062
the helicopter power. forces that they had. It was 
extremely difficult in that going. That's a

40:47.463 --> 40:49.186
different type of warfare. And I think the Army was 
justified in that particular war to have the

40:49.867 --> 40:58.803
helicopter forces they had. The Air Force could 
have done it, but there again would have been such a

40:59.684 --> 41:07.918
disproportionate, if you will, spread of the 
budget. into the Air Force versus the dollars for

41:08.438 --> 41:16.809
the Army that politically just wouldn't have been 
done. There was a lot of squabbling in the South

41:17.030 --> 41:25.602
Vietnamese War about these roles and missions, 
but we'll get to that later on. But the roles and

41:25.622 --> 41:33.973
missions, by the way, and the tactical procedures 
and everything that applied in South Vietnam came

41:35.523 --> 41:44.735
from the very exercises that I participated in and 
directed while I was 9th, Deputy Commander of the

41:35.523 --> 41:44.735
9th Air Force. In other words, they took that type 
of cooperation and techniques and tactics and

41:44.755 --> 41:54.188
they transferred that from South Carolina to 
Vietnam. Right. But because of the geographical

41:54.869 --> 42:03.741
and topographical layout of the battle areas, 
Even then it had to be modified, sure. And there

42:09.041 --> 42:16.772
again, see, we get to another question, but there 
again is we applied air power wrong.

42:19.777 --> 42:24.725
We're going to talk about Vietnam.

42:24.765 --> 42:26.688
Yeah, right. Is there anything else that we should 
talk about as far as Shaw Air Force Base? No, it was

42:30.374 --> 42:31.956
typical. Towards the end, I was given the 
assignment there. General Sweeney gave me

42:35.815 --> 42:58.467
additional job as commander of Tactical Air 
Reconnaissance Center, which was another R&D

42:35.815 --> 42:58.467
type agency, if you will, based at Shaw for 
developing tactical reconnaissance equipment

42:35.815 --> 42:58.467
and techniques and tactics for reconnaissance 
missions. And that was an interesting job. And

43:01.165 --> 43:16.259
that's one place where I became familiar with 
Texas Instruments and the development of

43:01.165 --> 43:16.259
so-called FLIR, Forward Looking Infrared 
Equipment, which was nothing in the world but

43:01.165 --> 43:16.259
night television, which turned out to be a 
fantastic piece of equipment. How does that work?

43:18.801 --> 43:26.108
It's an infrared type of photography which gives 
you a picture based on the differences in the

43:26.813 --> 43:55.521
temperature of the items that you're looking at in 
black and white and they have even converted this

43:26.813 --> 43:55.521
now by computer technology where they can make it 
as a color picture very advanced but then those

43:26.813 --> 43:55.521
days it was just strictly black and white and at 
night you can imagine how sensational it was to be

43:26.813 --> 43:55.521
in an airplane at night with a television view 
right there on your panel of the aircraft,

43:56.092 --> 44:14.080
forward-looking of the ground that you're flying 
over and picking out cows on the field, vehicles on

43:56.092 --> 44:14.080
the truck, trucks on the road, anti-aircraft 
displacement units, and so forth. Fantastic.

44:15.201 --> 44:17.024
Well, how could you pick up something like metal? 
Well, it'd be different temperature from the

44:17.745 --> 44:21.050
surrounding area. You could see where an airplane 
come over and take a picture of the ramp on an air

44:25.150 --> 44:39.155
base, say 15 minutes after the airplane taxied 
away, you could see the outline of the aircraft on

44:25.150 --> 44:39.155
the concrete because the temperature was 
different. You see, the sun couldn't heat the, in

44:39.175 --> 44:44.264
other words, the shadow of the airplane. Sure, 
sure. That's fascinating. How effective was that

44:47.009 --> 44:48.492
on Vietnam? Oh, that was the basis of the gunship 
tactics and techniques of the big C-130s with guns

44:49.130 --> 44:58.124
shooting out the side. Truck destruction, and I 
was proud to see that, boy, I was right in the middle

44:58.665 --> 45:05.616
of all that. That and the laser guys bomb. Tell me 
about the laser guys bomb. Well, that came about

45:09.001 --> 45:17.314
just about the time of my, when I was, had my job as 
the commander additional had to come out of the

45:17.800 --> 45:20.423
Texan Air Reconnaissance Center. The T.I. people 
come in, Texas Instruments, uh, engineers coming

45:21.424 --> 45:32.557
through and briefing me on, it wasn't part of my 
job, I had to have industry come in and brief me on

45:21.424 --> 45:32.557
certain types of equipment we were developing, 
monitoring. And, uh, that's when I met some of my

45:32.577 --> 45:47.233
friends at Texas Instruments that told me also 
about the laser-guided bomb, which, uh, to me was

45:32.577 --> 45:47.233
ten times more interesting and, uh, got my 
attention even more so than FLIR. I thought it was a

45:47.973 --> 45:50.798
new technique of bombing I'd never heard of. The 
accuracy was just unbelievable. I couldn't

45:53.482 --> 45:55.946
believe it when they told me that. And then I got 
interested in it. Do you remember when this

45:57.448 --> 45:59.071
meeting was? It was a few months before I went to 
Southeast Asia in 66, I believe. Okay. So I managed

46:09.370 --> 46:11.513
to get the T.I. to come up and brief me. So it would be 
late 65 because you went in 66. That's right, late

46:14.939 --> 46:16.181
65. Okay. As a matter of fact, I went over about 
Christmas. January of 66 you went. At Christmas

46:22.490 --> 46:30.723
with a wife and then took off to her great different 
country and mine. But tell me about that beam now.

46:34.449 --> 46:35.070
Laser guided? Yeah. Tell me about that bombing. 
Well, we're getting into the Southeast Asian

46:37.028 --> 46:41.755
assignment time anyhow, aren't we? Well, this is 
about time we left. I was to be assigned, and again,

46:44.058 --> 46:53.011
I'll get to that and tell you why I went to Southeast 
Asia. Again, I was picked specifically for a very

46:53.312 --> 47:00.062
peculiar assignment in Thailand. I would be 
deputy commander of the 7th Slant 13th Air Forces.
