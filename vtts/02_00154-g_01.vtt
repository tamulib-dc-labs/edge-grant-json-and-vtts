WEBVTT

00:06.764 --> 00:35.877
Then he went on to note that as

00:06.764 --> 00:35.877
his

00:06.764 --> 00:35.877
notoriety as a splendid hurdler broadened, a 
reporter for the Beaumont Enterprise inquired

00:06.764 --> 00:35.877
where he planned to go to college And he responded 
that he assumed he'd go to the University of Texas

00:38.084 --> 00:46.415
since they had a good team.

00:49.799 --> 01:06.741
The next day, the day after the appearance of the 
article,

00:49.799 --> 01:06.741
he recalled that, quote, a little man knocked on 
his front door, quote,

00:49.799 --> 01:06.741
and soon told him that he was, quote, too fine a 
person to go to the University of Texas. He should

01:15.754 --> 01:16.816
be an Aggie.

01:20.640 --> 01:36.880
That same gentleman promised that he would get 100 
Aggies to write letters of encouragement

01:20.640 --> 01:36.880
to this trackster.

01:42.783 --> 02:12.368
who then smiled and recall that

01:42.783 --> 02:12.368
the letters did come

01:42.783 --> 02:12.368
and that there was, quote, not a penny of bribe in 
any of them,

01:42.783 --> 02:12.368
comma, quote, but that Mr Babcock's

01:42.783 --> 02:12.368
intervention in his plan had changed his had 
altered his life. A redirection for which he would

02:18.003 --> 02:20.807
always be grateful.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.744
Another example of the.

02:34.829 --> 02:36.691
Changes at A&M and the role. And the key role of Earl 
Rudder.

02:42.065 --> 02:44.047
was linked to integration.

02:47.311 --> 03:00.647
Mr. Rutter was by that time a major general in the 
U.S. Army Reserve and thus was well acquainted

02:47.311 --> 03:00.647
with the routine of the Department of Defense.

03:10.198 --> 03:11.920
As the time came for enrollment of the first black 
students.

03:21.581 --> 03:40.708
I understand that Major General Rutter called the 
appropriate office in the Pentagon

03:21.581 --> 03:40.708
and requested that when they sent, when they 
identified the enlisted personnel to be sent at

03:42.359 --> 03:52.650
Army expense to A&M to complete their 
undergraduate degrees, that they include some

03:42.359 --> 03:52.650
black soldiers.

03:57.215 --> 04:11.691
He continued to urge that those men be carefully 
reviewed so that there would be no difficulty

03:57.215 --> 04:11.691
about their academic record.

04:14.978 --> 04:44.597
or other

04:14.978 --> 04:44.597
uh background matters

04:14.978 --> 04:44.597
then president rudder directed lloyd heaton

04:14.978 --> 04:44.597
the veteran registrar and director of admissions 
to review the transcript of these men and to ensure

04:45.235 --> 04:51.825
that they were enrolled in the proper summer 
courses. Since registration at that time was

04:51.845 --> 05:09.491
conducted either in Sabisa Hall or G. Riley White 
Coliseum, it was an old-fashioned affair where

04:51.845 --> 05:09.491
everyone stood in line and waited their turn.

05:13.016 --> 05:13.757
Mr. Rutter saw such a routine as having the 
potential for an incident, or perhaps even some

05:14.783 --> 05:25.118
protesters.

05:27.582 --> 05:42.985
So he told Mr. Heaton,

05:27.582 --> 05:42.985
whom I had heard earlier to say, that it would be, 
quote, over his dead body that a black student ever

05:43.792 --> 06:13.343
enrolled at A&M,

05:43.792 --> 06:13.343
comma, quote, that Heaton was to ensure that the 
students were in the appropriate

05:43.792 --> 06:13.343
sections and that he was to personally call each of 
the instructors of those courses to inform them

06:13.745 --> 06:31.545
that these enlisted men had been fully admitted 
and were appropriately enrolled.

06:31.565 --> 06:42.958
Since registration was on a Monday afternoon, 
those calls were on Monday morning, those calls

06:31.565 --> 06:42.958
were made Monday afternoon and

06:31.565 --> 06:42.958
the first knowledge that the public had of 
integration at the land-grant school

06:43.310 --> 07:12.692
was

06:43.310 --> 07:12.692
when a news report was announced that evening on 
radio and television that for the first time in its

06:43.310 --> 07:12.692
history, Texas A&M had enrolled black students 
had attended classes at Texas A&M that morning.

07:18.529 --> 07:41.262
There was not a single problem,

07:18.529 --> 07:41.262
never an incident, and racial integration 
probably

07:18.529 --> 07:41.262
moved more quietly and

07:18.529 --> 07:41.262
smoothly at A&M than at any other major 
institution in the nation. Meanwhile, I

07:48.081 --> 07:57.114
overlooked back as I was going through Austin, 
overlooked the end of the item on the name change,

07:48.081 --> 07:57.114
and this should be taken back.

08:02.341 --> 08:06.928
Vice President Hall recalled not long ago that Mr. 
Rutter simply could not accept the drop, the

08:09.153 --> 08:38.873
change to Texas State University because it would 
mean the loss of the traditional identifier A&M.

08:39.342 --> 09:08.100
Dr. Hall said it was he who created the idea and 
offered the proposal that the name simply become

08:39.342 --> 09:08.100
simply Texas A&M University with no periods after 
the initial A or M and that the there be an ampersand

09:10.898 --> 09:11.799
Instead of the. Word a indeed.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.708
For Mr Rutter, that was a. Very positive 
alternative.

09:27.636 --> 09:28.097
And thus. The effort proceeded smoothly.

09:35.365 --> 09:38.408
Gradually women began to be admitted. with less 
difficulty at the undergraduate level and the

09:40.075 --> 09:57.562
enrollment moved forward.

09:57.582 --> 10:07.618
As we entered the year of 1970,

09:57.582 --> 10:07.618
which would mark Mr Rudder's 60th birthday. Most 
of us were unaware

10:11.363 --> 10:19.050
that he was having health worries.

10:25.697 --> 10:37.909
During that spring complications from both heart 
and liver

10:25.697 --> 10:37.909
attacked him at almost simultaneously. and he 
died one month before his 60th birthday, thus

10:39.340 --> 10:51.491
making him ineligible for many veterans' 
benefits.

10:53.974 --> 11:08.487
Not even his classmate, Congressman Olin E. Tiger 
T., could obtain an exception to the 60-year

10:53.974 --> 11:08.487
policy.

11:12.179 --> 11:41.089
The board of directors appointed Clyde Freeman,

11:12.179 --> 11:41.089
appointed retired

11:12.179 --> 11:41.089
Lieutenant General Alvin Ludeke,

11:12.179 --> 11:41.089
Mike Teague and Rudder, a member of the class of 31, 
as the interim president. General Ludeke

11:42.807 --> 12:08.764
had earned a remarkable,

11:42.807 --> 12:08.764
had created a remarkable record of leadership 
success

11:42.807 --> 12:08.764
in directing the

12:12.727 --> 12:38.886
federal laboratory in California

12:12.727 --> 12:38.886
where the military rocket research efforts had 
been notable for their lack of success

12:12.727 --> 12:38.886
until he became the director of the Jet Propulsion 
Lab, JPL.

12:42.123 --> 12:43.545
Quiet in his demeanor.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.775
And always well organized.

12:52.159 --> 12:57.989
A&M proceeded forward.

12:58.009 --> 12:58.670
Meanwhile. Unknown to most of us. The board.

13:08.026 --> 13:15.837
had acted upon the advice of Earl Rudder in seeking 
a replacement.

13:20.924 --> 13:37.847
Back in the summer of 1968,

13:20.924 --> 13:37.847
Fort Albritton,

13:20.924 --> 13:37.847
class of 41

13:20.924 --> 13:37.847
or 42, I think, can look that up, The founding 
president and CEO of All Britain Engineering,

13:40.105 --> 14:01.176
Alenco, a booming little industry in Bryan,

13:40.105 --> 14:01.176
had proudly bought his company's first jet plane.

14:06.203 --> 14:09.488
For a number of months, he had been trying to 
persuade President Rudder to

14:11.594 --> 14:41.061
select a national public relations firm to begin 
to market A&M

14:11.594 --> 14:41.061
on a well-organized

14:11.594 --> 14:41.061
basis to a larger That

14:41.547 --> 15:03.661
effort, that effort bore fruit when All Britain 
and his classmate, dear friend, John Lindsay

14:41.547 --> 15:03.661
picked Mr. Rudder up for a flight to Chicago to 
visit with the PR firm.

15:12.580 --> 15:39.482
As Mr. Albritton recalls, they were somewhere 
over the Midwest, quote, somewhere over the

15:12.580 --> 15:39.482
Midwest, quote, when he turned to the A&M 
president

15:12.580 --> 15:39.482
and proudly noted the growth and progress fully 
underway on the campus.

15:42.297 --> 16:02.211
Then he asked

15:42.297 --> 16:02.211
Mr. Rutter what would be the circumstances 
regarding continued leadership if, quote, God

15:42.297 --> 16:02.211
help us,

15:42.297 --> 16:02.211
something were to happen to you. Do you have 
someone in place that could step in?

16:15.389 --> 16:37.088
Hesitantly, the A&M president noted that he had 
learned in battle in the battlefields in Western

16:15.389 --> 16:37.088
Europe that you, quote, always need an adjutant 
because any commanding officer may go down in

16:15.389 --> 16:37.088
battle. But at the present time, he had no one of 
that sort and that he would have to work on it.

16:49.291 --> 16:53.957
the two traveling companions dropped the 
subject. But then that evening over supper, then

16:56.181 --> 17:07.756
during dinner that evening, all Britain returned 
to the topic and inquired again.

17:13.204 --> 17:13.965
He remembered that Mr. Rudder smiled and said, 
I've been thinking about it since this afternoon,

17:15.933 --> 17:36.116
and if anything ever happened to me, you need to go 
to Tennessee and talk to Jack Kenny Williams,

17:15.933 --> 17:36.116
period, quote.

17:36.136 --> 17:43.564
The NM president noted that Williams had been the 
first commissioner of higher education for

17:36.136 --> 17:43.564
Texas, Thus had organized the Coordinating 
Board. And had worked with real skill and success.

17:52.934 --> 17:54.256
With the state legislature.

17:56.898 --> 17:57.739
Public schools. And all of the key leaders. In the 
state.

18:04.907 --> 18:06.109
Further, he noted. That Williams. Following a 
splendid. record of valor and achievement as a

18:13.548 --> 18:21.917
Marine in the Pacific in World War II.

18:25.140 --> 18:41.057
Had joined the faculty at Clemson University as a 
junior historian

18:25.140 --> 18:41.057
and worked his way up to the position as chief 
academic officer during the years that that

18:43.501 --> 19:10.504
separate land grant school in a southern state 
located off the main highway about a hundred miles

18:43.501 --> 19:10.504
from the state capitol where the state university 
was located and

18:43.501 --> 19:10.504
where

18:43.501 --> 19:10.504
whose

19:13.285 --> 19:16.669
supporters told Clemson jokes.

19:19.412 --> 19:32.947
A situation very much like Texas A&M and its 
realities in the Lone Star State. More, most

19:34.469 --> 19:40.035
importantly, he added that Clemson

19:43.627 --> 20:12.975
had changed from being an all-male, racially 
segregated institution with a comparatively

19:43.627 --> 20:12.975
narrow curriculum and a mandatory

19:43.627 --> 20:12.975
military organization for all freshmen and 
sophomores

20:16.685 --> 20:20.751
and had changed all of those policies during the 
Williams years. Thus, he could understand A&M

20:22.554 --> 20:26.339
well.

20:32.368 --> 20:41.241
At the time of Mr. Rutter's passing, All Britain 
was a new member of the board of directors.

20:44.866 --> 20:51.873
And in executive session, he shared, quote, 
Earl's recommendations with his colleagues.

21:00.221 --> 21:14.215
Quickly, the group decided to fly to Tennessee to 
interview Dr. Williams, who was the chief

21:00.221 --> 21:14.215
academic officer for the University of Tennessee 
system.

21:19.966 --> 21:25.755
All of the director, A&M directors except one, 
went on the trip.

21:31.904 --> 21:47.728
And the

21:31.904 --> 21:47.728
lone absentee who had a business commitment that 
he simply could not reschedule, truly could not

21:31.904 --> 21:47.728
reschedule,

21:51.657 --> 22:03.713
were so impressed with Jack Williams that they 
agreed unanimously on site that he was the new

21:51.657 --> 22:03.713
president.

22:03.733 --> 22:19.673
Sadly,

22:03.733 --> 22:19.673
All Britain noted

22:03.733 --> 22:19.673
that the absentee

22:23.652 --> 22:48.023
future Senator Peyton McKnight, P-E-Y-T-O-N, of 
Tyler, was so enraged that his director

22:23.652 --> 22:48.023
colleagues had reached a decision without him 
that he voted against Dr. Williams' appointment

22:23.652 --> 22:48.023
and later

22:52.981 --> 23:02.490
shook his finger in the new president's face as he 
informed him, I voted against you and I will be

22:52.981 --> 23:02.490
against you as long as you were here.

23:05.533 --> 23:06.073
Paragraph.

23:09.657 --> 23:19.326
I learned of Dr. Williams' selection through a 
phone call from George Kunze, the dean of the

23:09.657 --> 23:19.326
graduate school.

23:23.525 --> 23:38.205
a soil mineralogist who had grown up near Warda

23:23.525 --> 23:38.205
in a Windish family, W-E-N-D-I-S-H.

23:38.225 --> 23:53.245
I had the

23:38.225 --> 23:53.245
pleasure and honor of working with Dr. Kunze in the 
graduate college for almost three years.

23:56.330 --> 24:25.965
That appointment began

23:56.330 --> 24:25.965
unexpectedly

23:56.330 --> 24:25.965
after I invited

23:56.330 --> 24:25.965
Dr. Wayne Hall

23:56.330 --> 24:25.965
to speak to the History Club

23:56.330 --> 24:25.965
about going to graduate school and what kind of 
record it took for a undergraduate to be admitted

24:27.903 --> 24:43.916
to top flight graduate programs.

24:43.936 --> 24:57.808
Stevens and I were the volunteer advisors to the 
club and tried to place before those hopeful

24:43.936 --> 24:57.808
students individuals who might help encourage

24:59.712 --> 25:07.099
future attainment.

25:07.119 --> 25:25.258
Following the presentation, Dr. Hall and his 
associate graduate dean, Bill Barzyk,

25:07.119 --> 25:25.258
asked me to walk back to their office in the Koch 
building with them. Bill and I had been the

25:27.826 --> 25:50.794
co-drafters of the entire aspirations report

25:27.826 --> 25:50.794
with his having responsibility for the portion on 
research and the experiment stations and

25:27.826 --> 25:50.794
extension service while I did the RISL portion.

25:55.900 --> 25:56.601
When we reached the Koch building I was pleasantly 
surprised when they asked me if I would be willing

25:57.442 --> 26:17.200
to join them as the assistant dean of the graduate 
school

25:57.442 --> 26:17.200
on a half-time basis. I asked them if I might still 
teach and they said of course I might so I devoted I

26:27.783 --> 26:42.287
taught two sections, continued to teach two 
sections of history while

26:27.783 --> 26:42.287
serving as assistant graduate dean. In addition, 
I had accepted the assignment from my

26:44.871 --> 26:54.347
dissertation advisor, Frank Vandiver, as the 
founding editor of the papers in Jefferson Davis.

27:02.698 --> 27:03.739
Paragraph. Following the completion of my 
dissertation, I dreamed of doing a book-length

27:03.759 --> 27:24.385
project on the creation of the Confederate States 
of America, particularly the government of the

27:24.922 --> 27:47.803
independent South during the period that it 
located during the period from the secession of

27:24.922 --> 27:47.803
South Carolina in December 1860

27:24.922 --> 27:47.803
until the movement of the CSA capital to Richmond 
in June of 1861.

27:50.805 --> 27:52.667
Beginning in the summer of 61, The research on that 
project took me and the family on the road each

27:53.761 --> 28:04.893
summer.

28:07.276 --> 28:16.306
Within two summers, Vandiver had come up with the 
Civil War Centennial Commission. The National

28:16.646 --> 28:21.912
Civil War Centennial Commission had reached a 
decision to support the publication of the, and

28:23.630 --> 28:39.729
underline this as title, the papers of Ulysses S. 
Grant and the papers of Jefferson Davis.

28:43.234 --> 28:53.586
Vandiver saw this as a two-volume project, the 
Davis project as a two-volume effort, and asked me

28:43.234 --> 28:53.586
as I went around to libraries and other 
depositories looking for materials related to

28:55.102 --> 29:07.341
the founding of the Independent South about Davis 
materials.

29:10.346 --> 29:21.143
At the end of the summer, I reported back to him that 
all of the librarians had indicated they would

29:10.346 --> 29:21.143
not share copies of their materials if it was only 
going to be a selective project but would

29:22.692 --> 29:46.646
cooperate fully if the plan was modified to 
include all Davis correspondence to and from

29:22.692 --> 29:46.646
Davis and his speeches and other appropriate 
materials. Meanwhile, he had reached the same

29:48.289 --> 29:51.433
conclusion

29:53.928 --> 30:07.903
and he became the director of the Jefferson Davis 
effort and selected me as the editor.

30:11.447 --> 30:21.538
I had been going to Houston two afternoons a week,

30:11.447 --> 30:21.538
Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, just leaving the 
campus at about 11 o'clock, so I was at Rice from 1

30:22.582 --> 30:37.364
until 6 o'clock or so. Thus, I was teaching two 
sections, spending two half days a week at Rice,

30:37.384 --> 30:51.846
and now would undertake the halftime task 
assistant dean of the graduate

30:52.332 --> 31:04.731
under programs which under the new nomenclature 
at A&M was identified as the Graduate College.

31:10.239 --> 31:20.314
Paragraph working with Dr. Hall and Bill Barzac

31:10.239 --> 31:20.314
was very meaningful because I was able to view.
