WEBVTT

00:11.978 --> 00:21.128
Thank

00:11.978 --> 00:21.128
you.

00:46.235 --> 01:11.027
Thank

00:46.235 --> 01:11.027
you. Yeah.

01:30.344 --> 01:30.444
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

01:48.773 --> 02:11.271
um

01:48.773 --> 02:11.271
um .

02:27.755 --> 02:27.775
. What

02:28.987 --> 02:49.239
do you remember about your father and your 
parents? Well, we had a very lovely child. We had

02:49.940 --> 02:50.501
all kinds of friends. We lived on the farm. We had a 
family. And

02:52.207 --> 03:13.677
I remember them going to the fields and fishing. 
And I remember the women going to the fields and

03:13.697 --> 03:15.279
fishing. But we had children. Thank

03:16.507 --> 03:41.012
you. What

03:41.887 --> 04:05.481
about you? Okay,

04:06.878 --> 04:31.090
like this, like this, and like that. And we saw him 
at first. What kind of presentation? Well, at

04:32.152 --> 04:32.813
first, we were in a car. A long time ago. But we had 
talked about a buggy. And we were in a buggy. And

04:34.315 --> 04:34.935
some of you may have heard. Who's eating a buggy? 
But we didn't have a buggy. But we did. Okay.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.314
And then the boys go to class and the girls go to 
class. Definitely. And then we can go together

04:53.574 --> 04:54.456
once in a while. It's a really good time. Did you go 
to high school? .

05:23.685 --> 05:23.705
. . . . .

05:27.946 --> 05:53.482
or

05:27.946 --> 05:53.482
they're in cancer, not supposed to do like that. 
They need to go to a clinic. They need to go to a

05:54.083 --> 05:54.644
clinic. They need to go to a clinic. They need to go 
to a clinic. They need to go to a clinic. They need to

05:56.406 --> 05:56.967
go to a clinic. They need to go to a clinic. Yes, but 
before

05:57.680 --> 06:14.133
I was pregnant and I was 18, and my father was older 
than me, he had that first part of the contract.

06:14.153 --> 06:15.115
With the exception of my grandfather. My 
grandfather probably was the first in the

06:16.238 --> 06:17.460
country. But

06:18.014 --> 06:35.095
anyway, and then just, you know, kind of all of a 
sudden, you know, I

06:35.075 --> 07:04.322
don't

06:35.075 --> 07:04.322
remember ever being

06:35.075 --> 07:04.322
denied it. Is

07:04.741 --> 07:27.728
there anything that you remember about when you 
first started school? And

07:28.096 --> 07:54.801
then, when I was a little bit older, and then we were 
the fourth grade, they had, and we had a youth group

07:28.096 --> 07:54.801
now, and we had about three teachers. And each 
teacher had about three grades. Is

07:56.142 --> 08:22.639
there anything that fascinates you about 
farming? Airplanes

08:23.362 --> 08:45.918
and all

08:23.362 --> 08:45.918
sorts of things. We're in an airplane. I don't want 
to lose any particular thing. It's probably a very

08:47.240 --> 08:50.044
particular thing that we got to go through all 
these things and came to campus and came to the

08:47.240 --> 08:50.044
circle. And we always went to A&M

08:50.767 --> 08:57.653
just to dance. And we used to rock the stage and have 
fun. .

09:29.605 --> 09:29.625
. . . . . What

09:30.440 --> 09:45.807
about

09:30.440 --> 09:45.807
you? You got into high school, but did you go to a 
very big high school? Well, by that time, my school

09:47.190 --> 09:48.072
had been free. I was in L.A. and was a teacher. You 
know, it was considered a high school, .

10:15.899 --> 10:15.919
. . . . You

10:17.521 --> 10:33.837
know, it's a great job. It's a beautiful job to do. 
You know, it's great. It's a great job to do. You

10:35.341 --> 10:36.002
know, it's a great job to do. Spanish

10:37.062 --> 11:02.562
for

10:37.062 --> 11:02.562
three years. It looks like I have to say more than 
hello in Spanish. It's almost all I understand.

11:04.265 --> 11:09.330
Did they have a ? Are

11:09.968 --> 11:34.525
there any, very many folks, or any patients? No, we 
don't have any public students. We don't have any

11:35.326 --> 11:36.007
public students. We don't have any public 
students. We don't have any public students. We

11:37.429 --> 11:38.110
don't have any public students. We don't have any 
public students. That's

11:39.263 --> 12:00.670
a very huge difference. Tell me about, um, you 
know, you had that story with the people. Mm-hmm.

12:02.151 --> 12:04.294
Tell me about that, because it was, you know, what 
if they were going to do the same thing they were

12:02.151 --> 12:04.294
doing? Yeah. I don't know if they were going to do 
the same thing they were doing. I don't know. I

12:06.116 --> 12:06.377
don't know. Some made the plan, and some graduated 
and some didn't. I

12:09.723 --> 12:37.159
was

12:09.723 --> 12:37.159
a

12:09.723 --> 12:37.159
sister

12:09.723 --> 12:37.159
of mine, and she had a number of years in high 
school. And then it was good. It was good, and then,

12:37.619 --> 12:39.662
and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, 
and then, and then, and then,

12:45.211 --> 12:50.513
Thank

12:45.211 --> 12:50.513
you. One

12:51.623 --> 13:14.859
thing that, for Houston, I'm sure that, you know, 
the fashions, like, they have to do with their own,

12:51.623 --> 13:14.859
the fashions they have now. How did they, how did 
Patrick get a feeling, you know, over the popular

13:14.879 --> 13:16.502
fashions? The middle ground. The middle ground? 
Yeah. The middle ground. Yeah. A straight line

13:18.050 --> 13:30.587
that

13:18.050 --> 13:30.587
came down the

13:18.050 --> 13:30.587
hill, below the hill, and a painted skirt. That was

13:30.607 --> 13:35.813
our main uniform when we went to school. Most 
everybody had shoes in their mouth. And we wore

13:38.597 --> 13:40.800
shoes at the time. Mary

13:41.641 --> 14:04.635
Jane's, I believe, Mary Jane's, yeah, but it's got 
the tears and the little bow on it and everything.

14:04.655 --> 14:04.995
They're very bad. I don't know. They didn't have a 
good place. You know? They did have a good place.

14:06.678 --> 14:07.218
They did have a good place. They did have a good 
place. They did have a good place. Well,

14:08.759 --> 14:28.961
they were just a little

14:08.759 --> 14:28.961
beneath. That's what it was. I think that's the 
first time in my life that the dress was dead short.

14:31.985 --> 14:34.368
And what I did, that time, I was just a little blind. 
One time, I was short legs, and I got married, and

14:34.388 --> 14:36.510
now I'm very short again. That's one of the best 
times. We came in on this all the time. What

14:41.243 --> 15:03.987
was the first time when you graduated from 
college? What did you do? That was the first time.

15:04.848 --> 15:05.188
When I graduated. When I graduated. Well, from 
college. I graduated from school. From school.

15:09.153 --> 15:09.613
Three and a half years. Is

15:09.880 --> 15:37.951
there anything that you can do about your first few 
days as a teacher? No. Thank you. And

15:41.639 --> 16:08.608
I remember that They

16:09.331 --> 16:33.016
couldn't sell the whole brand. And for 20 years, we 
had this kind of contract. Because they believed

16:33.997 --> 16:36.459
that when a person dies, their soul is going to be 
something else. And you might be slain of your

16:36.479 --> 16:37.821
relatives if you break the contract. So that was 
interesting to me. And another thing was they

16:38.461 --> 16:39.102
grew. It

16:39.655 --> 17:06.345
was

16:39.655 --> 17:06.345
near

16:39.655 --> 17:06.345
the schoolhouse, and one of the students moved. 
And they were requesting the rise, you know, and

17:06.365 --> 17:09.088
they built the residue from the rise, built a 
building, and it began to happen. And

17:09.980 --> 17:33.751
they were

17:09.980 --> 17:33.751
terrible, just feet all the way around

17:09.980 --> 17:33.751
the edge. And they would look like braids. And when 
they got to where they were still, they would

17:34.432 --> 17:35.794
smother them. They would knock it down so it 
wouldn't fall off. Smother them. So that was

17:37.095 --> 17:37.596
everything. But again, that's what I used to go 
through when I was young. Rain

17:39.764 --> 18:03.312
Town. It was a very lovely place. It was a very big 
room. It was a private bed. It was a big reception

18:04.814 --> 18:06.115
room. And there was a maid and some others. And they 
had seven houses. So it was lifelong therapy to

18:08.452 --> 18:20.188
be invited out. And they're always therapy 
churches. I had seven nationalities. Because

18:29.801 --> 18:36.250
these people were all working on this thing. They 
were English. And I had some of their children. And

18:38.388 --> 19:00.323
I had young children in the community and in 
America. I believe I had a Russian student. So,

19:01.044 --> 19:02.066
thank you for the opportunity to work with you. I'm 
going to read the first three phrases. Did

19:04.207 --> 19:28.161
you find it out? Did you find it difficult when you 
first found it out? No. We had practice teaching.

19:29.884 --> 19:30.485
We observed practice teaching. We didn't do 
practice teaching. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no,

19:31.626 --> 19:31.847
no. No, no, no.

19:35.138 --> 20:02.783
What

19:35.138 --> 20:02.783
if

19:35.138 --> 20:02.783
they

19:35.138 --> 20:02.783
do

19:35.138 --> 20:02.783
have to go to church? They

20:03.421 --> 20:28.656
would have to go to another school. And the rest of 
the way was between two schools. So if they wanted

20:29.658 --> 20:31.160
to go to another school, they would go to another 
school. That's true. . .

20:46.674 --> 20:46.834
. . . So,

21:08.626 --> 21:25.017
.

21:25.037 --> 21:25.057
. . . . . I

21:25.822 --> 21:44.155
know I did one year, and I believe I did two. I'm not 
sure about that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

21:45.237 --> 21:45.497
know. I don't know. I don't know. Thank

21:46.730 --> 21:59.187
you.

22:02.609 --> 22:13.609
We

22:02.609 --> 22:13.609
married in May.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.365
No, we married in June. Been here ever since. 
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I

22:25.205 --> 22:49.500
just had one. That's me this morning. Did you stay 
at home when you first started in the drama school?

22:51.303 --> 22:51.724
Did you stay at home? Yeah. I stayed at home. You 
mean, did I live? Yeah, but you never did. I never

22:53.166 --> 22:53.406
did. And

22:53.842 --> 23:18.737
yeah, I took care of her, and I had a baby, and a 
little girl, and then I was able to do a little sex

22:53.842 --> 23:18.737
work, and PDA, and church work, and gut work, and 
other things. And then after about a year, I went to

23:18.757 --> 23:19.798
go to school. You

23:20.437 --> 23:40.920
know,

23:20.437 --> 23:40.920
I'm hard of hearing, and I'm sure

23:20.437 --> 23:40.920
I can't talk today. I think it's just the wind. It's 
the wind. March

23:44.315 --> 24:04.776
was a real March letter. And it always will be. I 
think I'll be able to work my way through the year. I

24:06.338 --> 24:06.758
went out yesterday. I'm not sure. It's been a long, 
long time. I didn't realize it. The church. What

24:08.648 --> 24:18.509
did you, what did y'all do like on vacation? On 
vacation? Well, we used to go to camp in Crips. bed

24:25.658 --> 24:40.663
bags, you know, and a wagon, and a bunch of young 
people, different families, you know, and you go

24:25.658 --> 24:40.663
down on the river.

24:41.707 --> 24:55.793
We

24:41.707 --> 24:55.793
would camp out and we would swing. And the boys 
would hunt squirrels and things. Of course, we

24:57.696 --> 24:58.498
always had squirrels. We can't do anything. And we 
played with the animals. We played with the

24:59.600 --> 25:00.441
flames. All

25:00.573 --> 25:20.174
kinds of games, you know, parties. And sometimes 
they beat you up. And they're not very good at it.

25:21.496 --> 25:22.137
And they have to worry about it. They have to live 
with it. And their kids, they're saying, they have

25:22.697 --> 25:23.818
to teach them. They have to teach them. And

25:24.603 --> 25:46.096
this was just the typical, the typical vacation 
for families to come here for food and to do a lot of

25:24.603 --> 25:46.096
traveling. Yeah. But we used to do it, we used to 
visit friends, college friends, you know. Maybe

25:47.739 --> 25:49.001
if we could do it, one of them would come and pick it 
up. And that's where we'd go camping. And, uh...

25:53.797 --> 25:57.732
Thank

25:53.797 --> 25:57.732
you.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.381
Amen.
