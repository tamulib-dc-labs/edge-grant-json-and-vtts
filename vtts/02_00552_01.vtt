00:07.270 --> 00:15.120
So the first question is, do you think the 
astronauts are heroes? I think that heroes is

00:15.140 --> 00:18.545
something that people make up in their minds. 
You'll find that most people that get put in the

00:18.905 --> 00:28.097
image of heroes are just plain people like anybody 
else, and they've all got their quirks and their

00:18.905 --> 00:28.097
weaknesses and their strong points. I had heroes 
when I was growing up, and they included guys like

00:29.038 --> 00:34.425
Chuck Yeager, who I later learned to know 
personally and found out that Chuck, he is quite a

00:34.709 --> 00:38.353
man. He's still a hero of mine, but he's still a 
person. I think that astronauts get put in that

00:41.236 --> 00:44.159
position. And consequently, they should be aware 
of it because they do have a strong influence on how

00:44.339 --> 00:52.267
kids think of them and pattern their lives. How do 
you feel about the media blitzes that you received

00:53.989 --> 00:58.053
as an astronaut? Well, that comes and goes. The 
media can be... It can be an enemy. It can be a

01:04.808 --> 01:05.669
friend. Prior to flying the first flight of 
Columbia, we had a lot of criticism regarding the

01:06.570 --> 01:15.080
vehicle, were we ever going to get it airborne. And 
after the flight, they were all our friends. And I

01:20.306 --> 01:27.375
think as we fly more and more, they will tend to be 
more critical than they have been. But they're

01:27.415 --> 01:30.138
going to start being that way. And I think you just 
have to learn to deal with the media. Quite often

01:34.261 --> 01:44.020
you learn after having been involved with some 
stories that they've done that they can slant

01:34.261 --> 01:44.020
things, maybe not on purpose, but they just don't 
know all the facts. So the way it comes out in the

01:44.040 --> 01:48.389
newspaper quite often is not the way it really is. 
What kind of pressures has being an astronaut

01:50.734 --> 01:56.505
placed on your family? The main thing, I think, is 
that I'm going a lot. But since I'm a Navy man and

02:00.484 --> 02:07.103
have spent months on cruises, I think at least my 
wife grew accustomed to that. So I believe they're

02:10.682 --> 02:13.425
more or less comfortable with the thing. I think 
perhaps during the flight and some of the

02:13.465 --> 02:23.817
hullabaloo that was associated with that, both 
pre and post, perhaps my kids got a little bit more

02:13.465 --> 02:23.817
of that. And they enjoyed it. I think it was kind of 
like being in the spotlight. But I believe they've

02:27.641 --> 02:30.785
adapted to it fairly well. How long will it be 
before we see women and minorities in space? Well.

02:37.306 --> 02:38.147
I'm a Southpaw. I got to fly that. We're one of the 
last minorities left around. I think that we have

02:41.691 --> 02:46.516
eight ladies training to fly right now. Not 
training to fly, but in the astronaut office. And

02:49.099 --> 02:53.263
we have three blacks. And we also, correction, 
we've got four. We've got four blacks. Hey, Chuck.

03:00.030 --> 03:00.971
Hey, Chuck. How are you? One Hispanic. Yes, sir. 
Check, please. oriental origin who mixes quite a

03:04.508 --> 03:08.071
few things. And I think that there's chances of 
seeing some of those people fly as early as next

03:08.212 --> 03:14.738
year. Are you going to say the lowest damage to any 
hero image that there might be? No, I don't think

03:19.262 --> 03:20.043
so. The First Lady and the First Black that end up 
flying, I know, are going to have more hero image

03:20.263 --> 03:29.593
associated with them than most of us have in the 
past. I almost feel sorry for them. That's really

03:31.735 --> 03:34.077
going to be a tough load to carry. Are the 
astronauts stamped out of the same mold

03:34.816 --> 03:39.764
physically or mentally? Oh, no. We've got, I 
believe, 78 people in the astronaut office now,

03:40.405 --> 03:47.115
currently, and quite a few that have gone on to 
retire. And you'll find out you've got just about

03:47.135 --> 03:51.442
as wide a range as individuals as you can find any 
place. There's a certain amount of common

03:56.585 --> 04:00.931
goal-oriented kind of philosophy, I believe, 
amongst the people. And also you'll find that most

04:01.011 --> 04:06.658
of the people are very hard workers, tend to work 
long hours, be somewhat workaholics. So there are

04:06.678 --> 04:12.967
some common threads, I believe, that link most of 
us, but there's still an awful lot of

04:06.678 --> 04:12.967
individualism.

04:14.749 --> 04:18.474
What types of changes are being made for the women? 
With regard to the spacecraft or how we operate?

04:21.238 --> 04:21.698
Very little. About the only thing is that the... 
the waste management facility, the toilet, was

04:26.251 --> 04:37.684
designed to collect urine from either males or 
females, and that was a minor modification that

04:26.251 --> 04:37.684
you probably wouldn't even know if I pointed it out 
to you. And other than that, size-wise, the

04:37.704 --> 04:48.276
pressure suit that would go outside has had to come 
down in a smaller size. That really is about all.

04:52.386 --> 05:00.096
We've found that working in space is a very 
relaxing, easy kind of an environment, with the

04:52.386 --> 05:00.096
exception of going outside in the pressure suit. 
And so there's not really any strength involved

05:00.797 --> 05:04.221
with it. And some of these ladies that we've got, 
for example, are awful smart. They're a lot

05:07.485 --> 05:09.347
smarter than some of the guys we've got around 
here. So as far as brains, they've got it all. We

05:12.211 --> 05:16.316
really haven't had to make any modifications for 
them, except maybe in our mentalities. Yeah. What

05:17.618 --> 05:21.893
is the criteria for becoming an astronaut? Well, 
there's a set standard of things people have to

05:22.716 --> 05:27.713
have filled, you know, degrees. We're looking for 
people with degrees in science or engineering.

05:36.465 --> 05:40.292
We've got two categories we selected now, pilot 
and mission specialist. Pilot type, of course,

05:40.933 --> 05:44.779
has to have quite a bit of time in high-performance 
jet airplanes. The mission specialists are

05:46.121 --> 05:55.877
mainly looking for people with usually PhDs, but 
all that's really required to apply is a master's.

05:55.857 --> 06:11.678
You look for people that like to do diverse things, 
that are interested in learning all about the way

05:55.857 --> 06:11.678
things operate, that tend to be operational in 
nature rather than all people that want to go do

05:55.857 --> 06:11.678
experiments. We have a lot of people with 
scientific backgrounds, You're really the kind

06:15.112 --> 06:17.095
of person we need. It's not somebody that wants to 
go down and do detailed science, but somebody that

06:17.135 --> 06:22.182
likes to study the overall thing. Are

06:23.965 --> 06:34.740
the astronauts fairly socially close-knit? Not 
really. I think the initial astronauts that came

06:37.597 --> 06:44.988
down, smaller groups and so forth, tended to be a 
little bit closer-knit group than what we've got

06:37.597 --> 06:44.988
now. We have small groups that are friends and tend 
to socialize, but not as a big unit. We have

06:51.678 --> 06:53.320
periodic parties. Most of them are associated 
with celebrating after a flight. We'll probably

06:56.345 --> 06:58.568
have one just a little... Jack and Gordo that just 
got down from STS-3 will pull off here in the next

06:59.003 --> 07:03.149
week or so. But we really don't tend to socialize as 
a group all that much. Is there anything like an

07:07.395 --> 07:09.939
Astronaut's Wives Club? Used to be a long time ago, 
but most of the wives just weren't interested in

07:09.959 --> 07:15.407
that sort of thing. And some of the wives will still 
get together for coffee periodically, but

07:15.667 --> 07:21.636
there's not anything like a wives club. Do you see 
the effects of public opinion in that? We see the

07:27.722 --> 07:31.387
effects of public opinion mainly through our 
budget. And I guess right now it would appear that

07:31.407 --> 07:43.183
the public is really behind us, at least you can see 
that reflected in Congress. Congress is very much

07:43.824 --> 07:46.027
in favor of what we're doing. And I think that's 
mainly been the case all along, although When

07:51.097 --> 07:56.391
we're not in the public eye, it is hard for the 
public to voice that support. But with the flights

07:57.153 --> 08:02.126
that we've got going with the space shuttle now, 
all we're hearing are positive words. You'll hear

08:02.146 --> 08:06.878
a few negative people, but they are not the 
majority. Is NASA suffering from the recent

08:07.567 --> 08:11.313
budget cuts? Very little compared to most of the 
agencies NASA fared out very well. Now, we did get

08:15.881 --> 08:20.329
some of our unmanned science projects cut back, 
unfortunately. We hope those will mainly just be

08:21.431 --> 08:26.299
deferred, and then we'll get to carry them out 
eventually. But in the long term, NASA fared very

08:26.379 --> 08:31.127
well in that, and that is because of both Congress 
and administration being very pro-space right

08:31.478 --> 08:36.345
now. Is the Defense Department in any way blowing 
up now? I think it is primarily due to the Defense

08:40.190 --> 08:49.923
Department's commitment to the space shuttle 
that we were able to fare those couple of years that

08:40.190 --> 08:49.923
we had prior to getting the shuttle off. We were 
having so much problems with our main engines, our

08:50.144 --> 09:00.017
tiles, our thermal protection system, that if we 
had not had the Department of Defense support we

09:00.436 --> 09:02.679
would have had a tough time holding our own. But we 
have had it, and I think it's been good for the space

09:02.739 --> 09:07.085
program. There's still been some people 
concerned about the shuttle's association with

09:07.506 --> 09:18.602
the military and that the science civilian end 
will end up suffering. I don't think that's going

09:18.662 --> 09:20.284
to be the case. The military has always utilized 
space just about ever since the first satellite

09:21.023 --> 09:29.276
going up, and they're going to continue to doing 
that. The space shuttle is just going to have a way

09:29.557 --> 09:35.927
of getting those satellites up easier and cheaper 
than we've been doing with unmanned rockets. And

09:36.167 --> 09:38.872
so I think it's good that we're working with the 
military. Now, I'm a little bit biased since I'm a

09:39.172 --> 09:42.137
military person myself. OK, plaque was placed on 
the moon. It said, here men came from the planet

09:45.468 --> 09:53.506
Earth, first set foot upon the moon July of 1969 AD.

09:54.729 --> 09:56.312
We came in peace for all of mankind. Are we still in 
space for peaceful reasons? Absolutely. The

09:59.680 --> 10:18.908
United States is committed to a space treaty that 
says we'll only use space for peaceful purposes,

09:59.680 --> 10:18.908
and I actually think it's been the military use of 
space, both in this country and in the Soviet

09:59.680 --> 10:18.908
Union, that has helped us maintain peace over at 
least the past decade. The nature of trying to

10:20.410 --> 10:23.835
maintain treaties like SALT without a valid means 
of ensuring what the other country is doing is just

10:24.035 --> 10:30.963
not reasonable. And you can use detection means 
from space to ensure that all signers of the

10:31.343 --> 10:38.952
treaties are doing what they say they're doing. 
And I think that has been one of the big reasons that

10:39.953 --> 10:48.943
we've been able to avoid any open confrontation 
with the Soviet Union. And so for that reason, I

10:49.083 --> 10:52.607
really think that we ought to continue to use 
space. So you feel this type of space diplomacy

10:52.807 --> 10:56.492
works? Absolutely. It beats anything else 
anybody else has come up with. Do you feel that

11:02.279 --> 11:06.003
space will turn into the next location for an arms 
building? It is possible. It is possible,

11:08.867 --> 11:09.968
certainly. And I hope that is not the case. But it's 
an environment that certainly has to be inviting

11:13.693 --> 11:20.822
for anybody worrying about... the kind of weapons 
we now have on the Earth. It's a new environment

11:25.741 --> 11:37.073
that man has tended to utilize each environment it 
is found to conduct war with. So it's going to take

11:37.794 --> 11:43.860
some very strong-minded people and countries to 
keep that from happening. And I think that is the

11:44.380 --> 11:50.927
intent of the US to try to keep weapons out of space. 
It often depends on what the other guy does. So then

11:55.166 --> 11:58.570
you feel that space-based wars are possible? 
Certainly possible.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.399
But right now, anything is possible. Right now, it 
does not appear that we're necessarily heading in

12:06.540 --> 12:11.827
that direction. So then would you say that they're 
inevitable? No, I would not say they're

12:16.169 --> 12:17.791
inevitable. I think we can control it. I'll tell 
you. What do you see as our future in space? Well, in

12:25.478 --> 12:28.581
near term, it's fairly easy to see. We're building 
a total of four orbiters or space shuttles.

12:33.466 --> 12:36.670
Hopefully, maybe even getting a fifth, and then 
maybe even subsequent ones. We'll be flying many

12:38.291 --> 12:46.159
flights each year, upwards, hopefully, of 20 some 
odd. By putting those many flights up, then you're

12:46.443 --> 12:52.590
going to see lots more of the same kind of 
satellites that we have now, more sophisticated

12:46.443 --> 12:52.590
ones. And hopefully those will be used to enhance 
the quality of life we have here on Earth.

13:00.038 --> 13:04.784
Eventually we would like to see us move out and 
build a permanent orbiting space station. And

13:06.165 --> 13:11.151
that is the next logical step in our progression of 
exploration of space. That is probably going to

13:11.485 --> 13:20.314
take close to 10 years from the time we're given the 
go-ahead on it, and we have not been given a

13:11.485 --> 13:20.314
go-ahead, although we're pursuing that pretty 
heavily at NASA. So I think that's the next big step

13:21.034 --> 13:24.298
you'll see in space. Beyond that, with that space 
station, we'll be going back to the moon, building

13:24.978 --> 13:34.227
a colony so that we can stay there and explore it for 
longer periods of time. We'll eventually go to

13:34.508 --> 13:36.890
Mars and beyond. But those kinds of things, in my 
mind, are... They will happen, but it's

13:41.422 --> 13:45.127
impossible to say when. People in these United 
States tend to be reactioners. I guess we'll have

13:52.397 --> 13:57.164
to wait until somebody does something to prod us 
into making us want to do that. I'll see you in May.

13:58.846 --> 14:02.451
What do you see as the legacy of space? Well, I'm not 
sure it's ready to have left a legacy yet. I think

14:05.733 --> 14:07.836
it's more like still a dream. We've only scratched 
the surface of what can be done in space. Since the

14:11.900 --> 14:19.509
first Sputnik was up and Yuri Gagarin and Al 
Shepard made their flights, we've come a long

14:11.900 --> 14:19.509
ways. I was back in college when that happened, 
about your age. And the things that have happened

14:23.973 --> 14:27.257
in that what to me seems like a fairly short span of 
time, are fairly fantastic. But we're still just

14:31.743 --> 14:35.429
kind of learning how to crawl. We're not up and 
running yet. Do you feel that all the money we spent

14:39.354 --> 14:47.346
on the space programs and the various different 
programs within could have been better spent

14:39.354 --> 14:47.346
elsewhere? Well, there's always going to be 
speculation about hindsight. Could I have done

14:52.474 --> 14:53.395
this better? Could I have done that better? I think 
perhaps, especially back in the Apollo days, we

14:56.313 --> 15:02.299
could have been more efficient with them that way 
we were spending our money. We had as a goal to go to

15:04.501 --> 15:23.400
the moon in the 60s, and we used money to help solve a 
lot of problems, to get over hurdles that we could

15:04.501 --> 15:23.400
have probably solved more efficiently with less 
funds if we had elected to spread out the time it

15:04.501 --> 15:23.400
would take. We have, since that time, with the 
shuttle, we have started to work in a way that is a

15:24.190 --> 15:34.282
lot more efficient and giving the taxpayer, I 
feel, more product for his money. The returns on

15:36.284 --> 15:48.338
going into space are multifold, and people have 
talked about spinoffs and all that kind of stuff,

15:36.284 --> 15:48.338
what it's done for medicine computers, and you can 
get spiels and see books written on the subject.

15:50.861 --> 15:53.404
Those monies, I think it's also important to note 
that They weren't just burned up in the flames of

15:53.941 --> 15:57.967
the rocket as it shot off. Those go into the 
American workers' pockets as wages, and so it is

15:57.987 --> 16:17.856
not necessarily a welfare program, but it 
certainly stimulates the economy in a certain

15:57.987 --> 16:17.856
way, and it gives us a positive, tangible kind of 
a... return on doing it. So I think one of the things

16:19.600 --> 16:33.313
that I learned after our flight that there was also 
maybe an even more important product of the

16:19.600 --> 16:33.313
flight, and that is the American people really 
need something that they can grab hold of and say,

16:19.600 --> 16:33.313
we did that and I'm proud of it. They certainly felt 
that way about the space shuttle. I think they

16:35.943 --> 16:36.804
still do. And all of those things, to me, add up as 
far as the government spending. I don't think for

16:42.091 --> 16:52.085
the amount of money that we're spending on the 
space program, you could have gotten very much

16:42.091 --> 16:52.085
good out of those monies invested in other places. 
People use the term, I forget the exact specifics,

16:53.067 --> 16:58.474
but... health, education, welfare kind of 
things, agencies, they go through NASA's, the

16:58.640 --> 17:06.367
same amount of NASA's total year budget, they go 
through that in like a week. And you could have

17:06.968 --> 17:15.856
given them another week's budget, and the good 
that they would have been able to do with it is very

17:06.968 --> 17:15.856
small compared to what I think we've been able to 
produce. So you feel the space programs helped

17:15.916 --> 17:21.562
unify the Americans? It certainly did right 
after, I know it did when we went to the moon. It

17:27.327 --> 17:28.208
did... with the first flight of the shuttle. And 
maybe we were needing something. We'd had a lot of

17:33.376 --> 17:38.856
things with the hostages and Iran. few things like 
that that went on that we were getting to wonder if

17:39.983 --> 17:45.010
we were still the great country that we are. At 
least a lot of people were, and the flight really

17:45.030 --> 17:53.642
did help solidify at least some patriotism and 
national pride again. And that'll come up. We'll

17:55.625 --> 17:59.630
do something else down the road that they'll show 
the same amount of pride in. How, in your opinion,

18:00.231 --> 18:05.058
did the war in Vietnam affect the space program and 
vice versa? It tended to... divert attention and

18:09.987 --> 18:17.295
funds away from it primarily because our national 
goals were oriented elsewhere. And I think that's

18:17.335 --> 18:22.381
natural when you're involved in a conflict. 
That's where our money should be going to try to

18:22.682 --> 18:25.585
resolve that. The space program survived all that 
and came out maybe the better for it because that

18:26.887 --> 18:35.456
was part of the role I was talking about earlier. We 
learned as an agency here at NASA to work much more

18:38.168 --> 18:45.522
efficiently and not tend to go solve all of our 
problems with pouring more dollars into them, but

18:38.168 --> 18:45.522
sell them otherwise. Being

18:45.562 --> 18:52.836
in orbit in space, if you will, In looking back, you 
can see the Earth and you see the space. How does

18:56.921 --> 19:00.386
this expanse of space affect you? It's kind of 
mind-boggling at first, the fact that you can see

19:00.406 --> 19:09.719
as much with just a glance as compared to what we're 
normally used to. It certainly gives one a feeling

19:09.739 --> 19:15.027
of... a newness, a unique environment that you're 
working in. Space is really a black place. Boy, I'm

19:21.435 --> 19:26.681
telling you, if you're not night adapted, when you 
look out into the black, that is about as black as

19:21.435 --> 19:26.681
anything could be. But it's also a beautiful 
sight, looking at the Earth from that altitude, or

19:27.122 --> 19:34.691
the kind of altitude we're talking about, the low 
Earth orbit, which we were about 170 statute miles

19:27.122 --> 19:34.691
up. And the speed, you know, you go around the Earth 
once every hour and a half, so you know you're

19:35.973 --> 19:41.119
really moving on. But... But you're just floating 
around while you're doing it. So I don't know of

19:46.328 --> 19:49.356
anything to liken it to. But it is really a 
pleasurable kind of a treat to enjoy. Do you

19:54.609 --> 19:59.762
feel space will become commercial? Oh, yes, in 
fact, it already has. Of the satellites that the

20:01.340 --> 20:21.514
space shuttle is carrying, about a third of them 
are commercial satellites, primarily in the

20:01.340 --> 20:21.514
areas of communications, but communications, 
weather, and that sort of thing are utilizing

20:01.340 --> 20:21.514
space extensively and have been, you know, when 
you tune in to the evening news and you see the...

20:21.848 --> 20:28.540
The weather shot, what all the weather is, part of 
that is from commercial satellites. You can sit

20:29.201 --> 20:36.834
down and you can watch a sports event that's going 
on in Europe or a news event that's taking place in

20:29.201 --> 20:36.834
South America or something. Most of those are all 
due to commercial satellites. We're also going to

20:39.299 --> 20:46.371
learn to do things like make new products up there 
that you can't make as well down here on Earth due to

20:39.299 --> 20:46.371
gravity. We experimented a little bit with one on 
this flight. It's a process called

20:49.426 --> 20:54.771
electrophoresis, which is used to generate 
certain kinds of pharmaceuticals. And the next

20:54.931 --> 21:01.457
flight will also have sort of a small factory for 
doing that that some commercial enterprises are

20:54.931 --> 21:01.457
interested in.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.101
Personally, is it worth it? Oh, yeah. The 
investment of the time that I personally put into

21:07.822 --> 21:12.066
it, absolutely.

21:13.427 --> 21:16.510
Well, I actually was associated with the space 
program that the Department of Defense was doing

21:16.675 --> 21:21.347
as early as 1966. I was supposed to have flown on 
that, and it got canceled, and I was transferred

21:21.467 --> 21:26.139
here to NASA in 69. And it was 81 before I got to fly, 
but had a great deal of fun in the meantime. I

21:34.124 --> 21:42.316
enjoyed every minute of it and thought I was able to 
contribute something rather positive to the

21:34.124 --> 21:42.316
flights that we did throughout the 70s. The treat 
of actually getting to fly was well worth it, and I

21:43.818 --> 21:50.368
hope to do it six, eight, ten more times if they'll 
let me. And for the country? Oh, absolutely. Well,

21:55.536 --> 22:02.005
I've gone into several of the regions for the 
country that I thought that it was productive, but

21:55.536 --> 22:02.005
to me... If a country is going to maintain its 
greatness like this one has, it needs to push the

22:03.065 --> 22:09.913
frontiers of technology. And the space program 
has given us an excellent way of doing that. You

22:14.839 --> 22:17.783
can't just sit back and write on your laurels. 
You've got to keep pushing and looking for new

22:17.803 --> 22:25.292
things and exploiting different kinds of science 
that we haven't utilized before. If you don't,

22:25.272 --> 22:27.755
we're going to be left behind. And I think the space 
program has given us a good forum for doing that.

22:35.304 --> 22:40.611
What do you personally think of the men who've used 
their space careers as stepping stones to

22:35.304 --> 22:40.611
political ends? All the more power to them. You 
know, people get through the space program and

22:43.314 --> 22:51.985
have left it for various reasons, quite a few of 
them because the flights were so far in between.

22:52.005 --> 22:53.507
And... As I said earlier, we've got people of all 
kinds of personalities and what have you, and some

22:54.736 --> 23:01.363
of them are very... It would seem the natural thing 
for them to do to get into politics. I think the fact

23:07.490 --> 23:16.500
that they were astronauts maybe is that gave them a 
little bit of push that I don't see anything wrong

23:07.490 --> 23:16.500
with that. Most people that get into politics, 
they'll use anything in their background that's a

23:16.620 --> 23:22.066
plus to help them. I don't think... The fact that 
they were astronauts really made them better

23:23.035 --> 23:32.440
politicians or better in government, but I 
believe it did probably widen their background a

23:23.035 --> 23:32.440
little bit.

23:35.769 --> 23:36.010
All right. Okay.
