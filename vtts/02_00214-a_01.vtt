Testing, testing, four, five, six, four, five, six, four, five, six.

00:23.491 --> 00:27.895
Testing, testing, seven, eight, nine, seven, eight, nine.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.059
We're testing a second time.

00:32.139 --> 00:34.061
Testing, testing, testing.

00:35.062 --> 00:36.624
Testing, testing, testing.

00:40.007 --> 00:44.051
This is July the 30th, I believe.

00:44.131 --> 00:44.652
That's correct.

00:45.290 --> 00:56.006
Monday afternoon, and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Colonel James Woodall about today, about his student years.

00:56.667 --> 01:10.347
To begin with, to introduce yourself to anybody that might hear this tape or read a transcription, describe growing up, elementary school, high school, what did mom and dad do, where did you all live?

01:10.387 --> 01:12.951
Tell us about what it was before you came to NM.

01:13.387 --> 01:16.993
Well, I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, July the 15th, 1929.

01:17.814 --> 01:22.321
And I was born in my grandmother's house on Gould Avenue on the north side.

01:24.043 --> 01:30.874
And I was raised the first few years around different places in Fort Worth.

01:30.954 --> 01:33.939
And most of the time, my father had a service station.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.504
And he had a service station on East Lancaster

01:37.653 --> 01:44.928
for years, and then he moved over to Camp Bowie and West 7th, and that was a prime location for a service station.

01:46.432 --> 01:55.170
We had lived in Fort Worth, then we had moved out to Lake Worth, then we had moved back to Fort Worth, lived over in the Poly section.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.573
I went to the first grade

01:57.160 --> 02:05.353
at Lake Worth, and it was a one building, a big old wooden, long wooden building.

02:05.573 --> 02:12.624
It wasn't exactly a one-room schoolhouse, but it was several-room schoolhouse, and it's pretty primitive.

02:12.664 --> 02:24.602
We had outdoor toilets, no indoor plumbing at all, and I went there in the first grade, and then we moved back to Fort Worth, and this was during the Depression, you know.

02:25.628 --> 02:27.430
were kind of tough for everybody around.

02:27.490 --> 02:33.595
Anyway, we moved back to Fort Worth and back to Poly, Polytechnic side.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.697
I guess that's the east side of Fort Worth.

02:36.257 --> 02:41.121
And I went to the third through the, let's see, second through the fourth grade there.

02:42.563 --> 02:47.086
And it was, lived about eight, seven or eight blocks.

02:47.127 --> 02:50.329
Of course, it was always walking to and from school.

02:50.349 --> 02:54.673
There's no such thing as anyone taking you to school or a school bus or anything like that.

02:55.852 --> 02:59.719
And I lived there until the end of the fourth grade.

02:59.759 --> 03:04.147
Then we moved back to Lake Worth, and I started in the fifth grade in Lake Worth.

03:05.149 --> 03:08.214
I guess it would be junior high by that time, or elementary.

03:08.234 --> 03:14.285
Anyway, I went from the fifth through the, well, up until high school there.

03:14.806 --> 03:19.615
Now, somewhere along the line, when I was about 11, I guess, my parents divorced, and

03:20.253 --> 03:28.145
And I was given a choice of whether I wanted to live with my mother or my father, and so I chose my grandmother and grandfather and solved that argument.

03:28.966 --> 03:32.972
And they lived at Lake Worth, and my grandfather was one of the pioneers at Lake Worth.

03:32.993 --> 03:40.204
He had opened up a business out there when the lake was first put in, and they put the first bridge across.

03:40.404 --> 03:42.908
And he had a very successful business.

03:42.988 --> 03:48.336
It was a service station, convenience store, feed store, wood yard.

03:48.620 --> 03:55.527
had the water supply system, had a bait shop, Minovats, ice house.

03:56.588 --> 04:01.593
And he had the ice route at Lake Worth and delivered ice to different people's homes around Lake Worth.

04:01.653 --> 04:03.755
So he was a real entrepreneur.

04:03.875 --> 04:08.200
And over the years, I worked just about every summer there on and off.

04:08.460 --> 04:10.582
Whenever I wanted to work, I could go over there and work.

04:10.682 --> 04:13.665
And so I kind of grew up around that.

04:14.202 --> 04:17.146
My brother was five years younger.

04:17.206 --> 04:19.288
Like I said, he went to live with my mother for a while.

04:19.368 --> 04:23.113
Then he eventually wound up with my grandmother and grandfather.

04:24.315 --> 04:32.225
Now, one thing I'm proud of is that, you know, I have veterans of the Civil War in my background.

04:32.265 --> 04:36.870
My grandfather's father was with the 6th Texas Cavalry.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.754
My grandmother's

04:40.645 --> 04:50.076
grandfather was with the 9th Texas Cavalry, and both of these were part of the Sol Ross Brigade, so that's always been a source of pride.

04:50.096 --> 04:56.984
Now as I was growing up, my uncle went to A&M, he was in the Class of 31, Russell Woodall.

04:57.945 --> 05:07.075
And my grandmother Woodall, from the time I can remember, used to be, used to talk to me about Texas A&M and tell me how great it was and how

05:07.392 --> 05:11.136
much had done for Russell, and of course his annuals were there.

05:11.176 --> 05:12.677
They were called longhorns at that time.

05:13.658 --> 05:21.707
And any time I'd go to my grandmother's house, I would look at the annuals, the longhorns, and I would also play with his saber, which I thought was really great.

05:21.727 --> 05:27.192
And when I got a little bit bigger, they let me take the saber home with me, and I had it in my closet for years and years.

05:27.272 --> 05:32.758
In fact, I carried that saber in the Corps of Cadets.

05:32.890 --> 05:40.218
After I graduated, I turned it over to Russell's son, and he carried it in the Corps of Cadets back in the 60s.

05:40.258 --> 05:42.360
He went to vet school down here.

05:43.261 --> 05:58.257
So anyway, I was raised at Lake Worth, and it was really an outdoor type life because there was woods right next to my house, and I always had a horse from the time I was about 10, I guess, and I would be down in the woods on my horse, and I had a

05:59.063 --> 06:07.733
I had guns at an early age, and I would be hunting down in the woods or just playing in the woods by myself or with other people.

06:08.934 --> 06:27.855
My best friend at this time was a fellow named Joe Earl Hodgkins, H-O-D-G-K-I-N-S, and we were best friends up until, well, we were best friends, but then he went to TCU and I went to Texas A&M, and we kind of drifted apart at that time.

06:28.105 --> 06:34.133
PhD in chemistry and of course I was in the army so we didn't see much of each other.

06:34.173 --> 06:35.936
He died just a few years ago.

06:37.478 --> 06:42.425
I had, during this time, World War II started.

06:42.445 --> 06:48.794
Now this was probably the most significant thing that happened during my lifetime was World War II.

06:48.894 --> 06:57.606
And I remember that I was in Fort Worth, Texas at a movie on a Sunday afternoon with my cousin, Bobby Johnson.

06:58.109 --> 07:01.695
And they stopped the movie and it was, the movie was Sergeant Yark.

07:01.735 --> 07:07.064
They stopped the movie and announced that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor.

07:07.144 --> 07:10.089
Well, you know, really we didn't even know where Pearl Harbor was.

07:11.050 --> 07:19.545
But from then on, it was the full court press for the American people on winning the war.

07:19.625 --> 07:22.349
And they built the bomber plant out near Lake Worth.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.673
And a lot of the people around that area

07:25.008 --> 07:41.304
worked at the bomber plant, and that's when times really started getting better, because up until that time, I know my grandfather gave a lot of credit during the 30s, and had everybody paid him off, he'd have been very wealthy, but he gave a lot of credit.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.025
It's like he had the water supply.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.749
I don't know that he ever cut anybody off of the water.

07:46.769 --> 07:53.395
He had people coming in, buying a few groceries, or buying a little gasoline, and he would give them credit.

07:54.623 --> 08:00.109
But I was in the Boy Scouts at this time, and our scout troop was very active.

08:00.570 --> 08:05.316
We spent a lot of times camping, and we just went out on our own a lot.

08:05.336 --> 08:17.610
So I did spend a lot of time in the woods, and I guess that kind of foretold what I was going to do in life, and that was being the infantry, where we did spend a lot of time in the woods, sleeping on the ground.

08:18.468 --> 08:37.458
Our boy scout troop was very active, like I said, and we gathered aluminum, we gathered newspapers, we gathered magazines, we gathered scrap iron, just anything that they, rubber tires, whatever the government said they needed to collect, well, our scout troop was out collecting it.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.064
And I know, you know, I was very interested in the war.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.249
In fact, I was afraid the war would be over before I could get into it.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.112
I remember going down to the

08:46.767 --> 08:54.417
different recruiting officers with my friend Joe, and we'd go down and we'd try to join, and they'd tell us to come back in a couple of years.

08:54.637 --> 09:00.986
And two of my friends down the street, they were twins, they joined when they were 15.

09:01.507 --> 09:09.417
But I couldn't get my parents or grandparents or anyone to sign anything, so I wasn't able to do that.

09:09.616 --> 09:20.351
My grandfather was the civil defense warden for Lake Worth, and of course I was his messenger, and I thought that was a big deal, being a messenger in the civil defense.

09:21.252 --> 09:31.506
They had a lot of training for the civil defense people, and I used to go with my grandfather to the training, so I was actively involved in World War II, although I didn't participate.

09:33.207 --> 09:39.891
At high school, well, when I was in the eighth grade, the school at Lake Worth burned down.

09:41.075 --> 09:45.411
And this was during the war, and material was very hard to get.

09:45.779 --> 09:58.600
After the school burned down, we went to school in churches, and we went to school at another school district, half-day schools, and it was really a mess, my eighth grade.

09:58.620 --> 10:04.049
So I decided I would go to North Fort Worth to high school, 9th, 10th, and 11th.

10:05.812 --> 10:10.099
We only went 11 years in those days.

10:10.568 --> 10:20.680
At Northside, they had the ROTC program and I wanted to get into that because I figured that would, you know, if I can't get in the service, well, I can at least get in the ROTC and wear a uniform and march around a little bit.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.144
So I did that and that was one of my main activities in high school.

10:24.785 --> 10:26.386
We had no sports at Lake Worth.

10:26.507 --> 10:31.653
It was just a small country school and they really didn't have any sports in the junior high.

10:31.693 --> 10:39.782
Now, they were just getting a football program when I moved into, I didn't move in, but when I went to Northside High,

10:41.635 --> 10:47.362
I weighed about 125 pounds and the football players there were 200 and up.

10:47.502 --> 10:48.964
It was a big team.

10:49.304 --> 10:52.889
But my junior year I decided well maybe I will go out to football.

10:52.929 --> 10:59.958
I went out and it didn't take me too long to learn that I would never be anything more than a tackling dummy.

11:00.098 --> 11:04.403
So that one year sufficed.

11:04.838 --> 11:13.210
But one thing the football boys got to do at Northside, they got to be the ushers at the Fort Worth, they call it the fat stock show at that time.

11:13.290 --> 11:18.898
And so I got to be an usher at the rodeo, and I saw every performance of the rodeo for three years running.

11:19.819 --> 11:27.109
Now while I was in high school, I also attended ROTC summer camp at Camp Dallas over near Mineral Wells.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.012
And I went there two summers.

11:30.054 --> 11:34.660
And in the Boy Scouts, I went to Worth Ranch, which was over near

11:35.095 --> 11:49.630
mineral wells, well actually it was near Palo Pinto in Palo Pinto County on the Brazos River and I went there to the summer camp, the boy scout camp every summer for probably four or five years.

11:54.055 --> 12:02.403
I really don't know, during my high school years my closest friend was Bobby Crowe.

12:03.124 --> 12:04.866
Bob Crowe came to A&M with me

12:05.403 --> 12:14.335
And he was my roommate, but he, in an intramural game just before Thanksgiving, he got several teeth knocked out and went home, and he actually never came back.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.178
And part of it might have been his grades.

12:17.619 --> 12:18.340
I don't know what it would be.

12:18.380 --> 12:26.170
He did not come back, and he was coming down to see me the following year when I was a sophomore, and he had an accident in his car, and he was killed on the way down here.

12:26.270 --> 12:32.338
So I've always, you know, felt awfully bad about that.

12:34.124 --> 12:37.108
Now, are we supposed to, I'm not supposed to go into A&M.

12:37.909 --> 12:40.493
So you graduated in spring of, I graduated in.

12:41.194 --> 12:41.915
Spring of 40.

12:41.955 --> 12:42.936
Spring of 1946.

12:44.779 --> 12:48.084
Now, did you think about going to school, to college anywhere else?

12:48.524 --> 12:50.587
It never entered my mind to go anywhere else.

12:50.607 --> 12:56.836
Now, my grandmother wanted me to go to Abilene Christian College because she was strong Church of Christ.

12:58.458 --> 13:01.903
And she called me in my senior year of high school and said, Jimmy,

13:02.609 --> 13:07.335
If you go to Abilene Christian College I'll pay your way and I'll buy you a new car.

13:07.435 --> 13:18.350
Well in 1946 a new car was something, in fact a car was something because people in high school, very, very few in high school even had a car.

13:18.790 --> 13:20.372
Most families only had one car.

13:21.033 --> 13:26.220
So that was a very interesting proposal.

13:26.791 --> 13:33.780
And I told her, well, you know, it'd really be great, Granny, to drive out there to Abilene Christian College in my own car and everything.

13:34.503 --> 13:37.347
But I think I'll just hitchhike down A&M and be an Aggie.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.989
So that's what I did, you know.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.192
Had you been down here to visit?

13:41.212 --> 13:42.795
I've never been to A&M.

13:43.436 --> 13:46.420
Never been, I don't guess I've ever been south of Waco.

13:47.121 --> 13:50.005
So when you came to enroll, that was your first?

13:50.546 --> 13:53.990
First time I ever saw it when we drove up down Highway 6.

13:54.010 --> 13:55.152
Describe that trip.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.875
Who brought you and what did you bring with you?

13:56.895 --> 13:58.957
Well, I want to go back a minute.

13:59.658 --> 14:02.923
Like I said, I worked every summer doing something.

14:03.005 --> 14:08.134
Sometime I didn't work all summer, but I worked on and off with my grandfather almost every summer.

14:08.154 --> 14:16.848
And then my summer of the end of my senior year in high school, I worked in the stockyards, North Fort Worth stockyards.

14:16.908 --> 14:19.933
I worked primarily in the horse and mule barn.

14:20.334 --> 14:21.917
Now this was during my cowboy days.

14:22.498 --> 14:28.708
And I was riding in the rodeo on Saturday nights and Wednesday night, there was a little rodeo there.

14:29.414 --> 14:30.375
I'd ride in the rodeo.

14:30.415 --> 14:42.027
I did mostly what they call the wild mule race, where three of us would be on the end of a rope, and we'd try to stop the mule and get on it and ride it at the other end of the arena.

14:42.047 --> 14:42.868
And we had it down.

14:43.729 --> 14:46.772
In fact, we kind of trained, and so we won almost every night.

14:46.812 --> 14:50.196
So it cost $3 to enter, and the first prize was $15.

14:50.596 --> 14:55.101
So that's the way we made our spending money, was the wild mule race.

14:55.121 --> 14:58.645
And while I was working in the stockyards, I had a number of them.

15:00.008 --> 15:01.509
good experiences, I guess.

15:01.730 --> 15:06.694
One, a fellow hired me to drive him down to South Texas and buy mules.

15:06.754 --> 15:15.283
Now, this was the end of World War II, and they were buying mules and sending them to Turkey and Greece as part of the aid program.

15:15.323 --> 15:24.552
So we went down to South Texas around Hallettsville and Yoakum, Shiner, Schulenburg, down in that area, and we bought every mule in the country that we could find.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.075
And we wound up with, I guess, probably

15:28.325 --> 15:31.128
200 or more mules in Hallettsville.

15:32.028 --> 15:35.051
The problem was the railhead was in Yoakum.

15:35.071 --> 15:37.634
So we had to get the mules from Hallettsville to Yoakum.

15:37.654 --> 15:43.719
So we had what was, I tell people, was the last wild mule drive in Texas.

15:43.839 --> 15:44.840
I participated in that.

15:44.900 --> 15:48.924
And we drove them right down the bar ditch from Hallettsville to Yoakum.

15:49.625 --> 15:52.567
And we got them all there, or at least we think we got them all there.

15:53.548 --> 15:57.792
And then another fellow hired me to drive over to

15:59.527 --> 16:01.973
to Troy, Alabama.

16:02.294 --> 16:16.489
Now, what we did, we took a load of mules over there, an 18-wheeler, took a load of mules over there and sold them in the auction, and then we picked up some cars, and the fellow that was his partner over there in Troy, Alabama was also a Ford dealer, and in this

16:16.891 --> 16:25.601
At this time, there was a lot of black marketing going on with new cars and new trucks because if you wanted to buy one, you had to slip something on the table.

16:25.641 --> 16:27.463
So that's what these guys were doing.

16:27.503 --> 16:34.872
I figured it out, but I figured I wouldn't be involved if I just drove a vehicle not knowing anything.

16:35.572 --> 16:42.020
So they loaded a couple of Fords on that truck, and then they gave me a strip down.

16:42.080 --> 16:46.645
It would have been a flatbed truck, but it didn't have any bed on the back of it.

16:47.080 --> 16:51.848
It was a brand new truck and I had to drive that from Troy, Alabama to Fort Worth, Texas.

16:53.051 --> 17:11.383
And I almost didn't make it because I stopped in Mississippi and at that time I smoked and I was putting gas in the truck and I lit a match to light a cigarette and the thing blew up and didn't catch the truck on fire but the fire was shooting out of the

17:13.017 --> 17:19.965
out of the, well, whatever you call it, place where you put the gasoline, it was a nozzle or something.

17:20.025 --> 17:33.622
Anyway, the fire was shooting out of that and the nozzle was laying on the ground and the fire was shooting out of that and I took off running because I thought the whole thing was going to blow up and the filling station guy came out and stuffed a rag in it and put the fire out.

17:33.642 --> 17:37.767
And I never did tell that guy that I owned this truck that I almost blew it up.

17:37.827 --> 17:42.012
But anyway, I made that back and then

17:42.464 --> 17:45.527
That was when I, that August, I went down to Texas A&M.

17:45.567 --> 17:52.235
My father took me down there, and I'd never, never seen, been at A&M, never seen it.

17:52.615 --> 18:02.646
I'd just seen pictures of it in the newspaper, and I was convinced that that was the right place for me, and I was also convinced that I wanted to be in the cavalry.

18:03.247 --> 18:12.437
So the cavalry was in the books that my uncle had back in the 30s, and I thought they still had the horses down here, so I'd signed up for that,

18:12.822 --> 18:35.877
came down I told people I was supposed to be in the cab and they said well you know uh don't have any cab we don't have any horses well that was you know shock to me so they put me in the infantry and which is all right because I uh I wound up uh spending a career in the infantry and loved loved most of it not every minute but most of it describe uh

18:37.055 --> 18:40.419
You all came down and, you know, strived that trip coming down here.

18:40.739 --> 18:41.620
What did you bring?

18:41.981 --> 18:47.827
Well, I brought a footlocker, and what I had was in that footlocker, and that was all.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.129
What little was in there?

18:49.409 --> 19:02.824
Well, just a little bit of civilian clothes, and I had some, you know, khaki shirts and khaki pants that I had, I thought I could use down here that I had in high school, and I think I had a radio.

19:03.985 --> 19:05.227
They didn't even have a clock on it.

19:05.247 --> 19:06.488
I'm sure I had an alarm clock.

19:07.868 --> 19:12.472
No recreational equipment, no tennis rackets or anything?

19:12.672 --> 19:13.413
Nothing like that.

19:13.994 --> 19:18.198
Shoes, socks, underwear, and a little bit of clothing, and that was it.

19:18.398 --> 19:23.602
When you got here, how did you find wherever it was that you were, where you were supposed to go?

19:23.843 --> 19:33.592
Well, I don't know, but I wound up at Goodwin Hall, and I went in there to the housing in Goodwin Hall, and they gave me a little card that said what dorm I was in.

19:33.652 --> 19:36.154
So I went over to the dorm,

19:37.805 --> 19:44.224
And my father and I lugged the, it was darn 12, we lugged the footlocker up.

19:45.547 --> 19:48.797
And father said goodbye and see you later.

19:48.877 --> 19:50.462
And he took off back to Fort Worth.

19:50.582 --> 19:53.029
Did he give you any advice or counsel?

19:53.701 --> 19:55.624
Well, he didn't know any more about A&M than I did.

19:55.844 --> 19:59.570
Did your grandmother give you any advice or anybody give you any advice when you left?

19:59.690 --> 20:02.073
No, I don't know that I ever got any advice.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.116
Just go down and do the best you can.

20:04.177 --> 20:07.522
Financially, what resources did you have available?

20:07.542 --> 20:09.204
Well, I had some money.

20:09.384 --> 20:13.811
After my parents divorced, they had put some money in a savings account.

20:14.232 --> 20:15.253
I had that money.

20:15.723 --> 20:20.591
And then my father paid my tuition, and I paid any expenses and everything out of that money.

20:20.651 --> 20:23.936
And, of course, any time I wanted money, I could ask my grandmother and my grandfather.

20:23.976 --> 20:26.400
They, you know, they were pretty well off.

20:26.961 --> 20:29.665
But I never did, I really never did ask for much money.

20:29.966 --> 20:31.008
I'd rather make my own.

20:31.829 --> 20:32.710
And so that's what I did.

20:32.730 --> 20:37.218
And, of course, I'd saved, you know, I'd worked, and I had saved up some of my own money.

20:37.318 --> 20:39.942
So, and nothing, you know, it just didn't cost anything.

20:40.057 --> 20:45.082
Like, as far as eating out, I don't know, I can't remember, but one or two times I ever ate out down here.

20:45.102 --> 20:51.128
There was a Mexican place in town there that we'd go to every once in a while.

20:51.868 --> 20:59.315
And I remember that one guy that went with, he'd always, you know, you'd get three enchiladas on a Mexican plate, and he'd always order four.

20:59.335 --> 21:02.438
And I thought, boy, that's really extravagant, you know, spending all that money.

21:03.179 --> 21:06.402
But I really didn't have any.

21:07.276 --> 21:13.462
any money problem because, you know, my tuition was paid for and I had my own spending money, which I rationed out.

21:13.603 --> 21:19.389
And, you know, I'd worked a little bit along, well, my junior year or my sophomore year, I guess it was.

21:19.549 --> 21:24.134
I used to sell ice cream and things like that at the baseball game, make a few dollars.

21:24.294 --> 21:35.005
And then, well, my senior year, I was the editor or the co-editor of the Aggieland and I'm, they paid me $35 a month for that.

21:35.238 --> 21:41.144
And I was making $27 and change for ROTC scholarship, I mean contract.

21:42.186 --> 21:47.772
And so, you know, I was palling down $50, $60 a month just on that.

21:47.872 --> 21:49.373
And that was plenty of money.

21:49.714 --> 21:50.915
There wasn't anything to spend it for.

21:51.416 --> 22:00.666
Describe what, how you, that first day or so, describe how you learned about what A&M traditions and all that.

22:00.706 --> 22:04.570
Well, I'll tell you what, I walked in there and the first thing I met, well,

22:05.208 --> 22:07.752
was a sophomore, and he wasn't even supposed to be there.

22:07.832 --> 22:21.131
He was just down from Hearn, named Pat Hall, and he, big, tall, raw-boned, country-talking guy, and he started hollering at us and going on.

22:21.152 --> 22:32.749
Well, the senior came out finally and got us and put us in the room, and I think they ran him off, and then that week, we didn't have any sophomores around, but we had, it was kind of an orientation week.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.371
Of course, we went to a lot of

22:34.958 --> 22:43.109
a lot of classes that the university put on, and we had classes there in orientation, and they started trying to teach us to march.

22:43.129 --> 22:53.743
Well, the thing about it is I knew how to march better than anybody in my company, including the seniors, because I'd been doing it for three years, and we spent a lot of time in high school with that,

22:54.247 --> 22:59.752
And down here at A&M, they kind of have their own, you know, their own way to do that.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.574
But I knew a lot more about it than they did.

23:01.594 --> 23:02.896
But I never let anybody know.

23:02.916 --> 23:06.920
You know, if they wouldn't show me how to do right face, I'd let them show me.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.424
I never let on that I knew, you know, more than they knew.

23:11.444 --> 23:14.367
I was smart enough not to do that.

23:14.567 --> 23:18.651
But I really never had any problems with the upperclassmen.

23:18.711 --> 23:20.473
I mean, they tried to get to me.

23:20.842 --> 23:29.071
And every freshman had a handle, and my handle was Fish Happy as a Bug's Ass Woodall, because I would laugh right in their face.

23:29.191 --> 23:35.177
Well that would drive them crazy that I would laugh at them, but I never let them get to me, you know.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.239
Did that nickname have a short version?

23:38.461 --> 23:39.402
Well Fish Woodall.

23:40.643 --> 23:41.063
But Happy?

23:41.444 --> 23:42.145
No, no, no.

23:42.245 --> 23:44.007
They never shortened it to one word?

23:44.027 --> 23:44.527
No.

23:44.627 --> 23:46.149
Now what outfit was it?

23:46.169 --> 23:47.250
I was in D. Infantry.

23:47.630 --> 23:49.212
Now did it have a nickname?

23:49.580 --> 23:53.068
Spider D. Why Spider?

23:53.328 --> 23:59.623
Because there was somewhere along the line there was a commander whose nickname was Spider and they just started calling it Spider.

23:59.643 --> 24:02.629
In fact, there's still a Spider D in the Corps now.

24:03.231 --> 24:07.420
What did Spider D members think was special about that outfit?

24:07.957 --> 24:09.979
What did they do better than anybody?

24:10.280 --> 24:16.847
Well, they just, like most other people, of course, they think they're the best outfit that's over there, and that's just what we thought.

24:17.568 --> 24:20.371
Describe your room and what it was like.

24:20.391 --> 24:23.334
Well, it was the, there were three of us in a room.

24:24.075 --> 24:33.145
Like I said, Bob Crow, a classmate from our side, was in the room, and then Clyde Newberry from Big Lake, Texas, was in the room.

24:34.887 --> 24:35.668
One of the first...

24:35.935 --> 24:37.917
things we did was go to Guyon Hall.

24:38.638 --> 24:45.586
We sat in Guyon Hall for one of the orientations and the guy says look at the guy on the right and look at the guy on the left.

24:46.027 --> 24:46.948
They're not going to be here.

24:47.008 --> 24:53.516
Well at that time I said to myself, well I don't know about those guys, but I'm going to be here.

24:54.557 --> 24:57.320
And as it turned out I was the only one that made it.

24:58.181 --> 25:00.424
Like I said Crowe left early

25:00.860 --> 25:05.626
And then Newberry left at the end of the freshman year, and I never saw him again.

25:05.646 --> 25:08.350
He went back to West Texas.

25:08.770 --> 25:10.893
What was in that room that you threw?

25:10.933 --> 25:15.939
There was a bunk bed and a one bed, you know, just a single bed.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.806
Then there were two tables, and we had a radio.

25:21.266 --> 25:27.454
There were no curtains, no rugs, no nothing but just, we had, you know, GI blankets.

25:27.635 --> 25:29.517
Which of those three beds was yours?

25:29.733 --> 25:30.835
You know, I have no idea.

25:30.855 --> 25:32.898
I don't remember which one it was.

25:32.938 --> 25:39.908
But then after Thanksgiving, when we came back after Thanksgiving, we moved one bed out.

25:40.870 --> 25:52.508
And in fact, my aunt told me here some time ago that when I went home for Thanksgiving in my freshman year, that I told them I wasn't going back.

25:52.608 --> 25:54.070
And they said, you are going back.

25:54.877 --> 26:01.845
And they got in my bag and they put me in the car and they took me out south of Fort Worth to the Aggie line and said, get on back down there.

26:01.865 --> 26:03.067
Well, I don't remember that.

26:03.727 --> 26:11.436
I know there were times, like probably any other freshman that's ever been in the Corps, there were times and I said, you know, I'm not going to put up with this anymore.

26:12.338 --> 26:17.003
And I'll say this, for 1946, that was a bad year for freshmen.

26:17.692 --> 26:20.375
This was just at the end of World War II.

26:20.495 --> 26:26.862
They had had the accelerated program where people went on a tri-semester year.

26:27.062 --> 26:28.043
They went year round.

26:28.744 --> 26:33.268
So what you had, you had a lot of upper classmen that were very young, very immature.

26:33.689 --> 26:43.579
And of course I was just, I had just turned 17 when I came down here and probably I was a year or two early to go to college because I did struggle academically my first year.

26:43.599 --> 26:46.382
I only failed one course in my entire

26:47.088 --> 26:49.192
college career, and that was English.

26:50.174 --> 27:01.474
And my freshman year, part of the final exam was spelling 100 words, and if you missed one word, you failed the entire course.

27:02.336 --> 27:07.425
Well, I was never really that great on spelling.

27:07.473 --> 27:10.559
And of course I missed like three or four of them.

27:11.020 --> 27:23.384
And it was a woman prof, which you know everybody hated having a woman prof because there were no girl students and there certainly shouldn't be any women prof. Well I had one of the few women profs and she got me.

27:23.985 --> 27:26.109
But that was the only course I ever failed.

27:26.149 --> 27:28.654
But the hazing was so bad.

27:29.343 --> 27:36.956
I mean, they would get us up in the middle of the night, take us in the showers, turn the hot showers on, exercise until we just about passed out.

27:37.137 --> 27:39.100
And of course, they used the board all the time.

27:39.501 --> 27:53.325
You could walk by, you could walk over the quad by any dorm at just about any given time and you'd hear boom, boom, boom, where somebody was getting their rear end beat with this board, which was anywhere from three to six feet long.

27:53.812 --> 27:55.834
But it was unreasonable.

27:55.874 --> 28:02.300
Now, all of that came to a head at the end of that semester or during that semester, I guess it was.

28:03.861 --> 28:08.846
And I'm trying to think if it was that semester or the spring semester.

28:09.607 --> 28:21.017
Anyway, the board, the president put out new rules and new regulations and said they were gonna do away with hazing and there'd be no more maid service and maid service at that time where you

28:21.301 --> 28:26.928
had to clean up an upperclassman's room, you had to keep his room just like you were his, that's what you were, you were his maid.

28:27.449 --> 28:30.833
Weekends you waxed his floor, whatever else.

28:31.334 --> 28:36.260
The only thing we didn't do, we never had to shine anyone's shoes.

28:36.721 --> 28:49.097
I know that in the Corps that was one of the things, I guess they're still doing it, but the theory then was, and this was kind of racist, but the theory then was that blacks shine shoes and we don't shine shoes.

28:49.904 --> 28:55.593
So anyway, the hazing was out of control.

28:55.773 --> 28:57.703
Well, they put out rules about this.

28:58.342 --> 29:03.108
And the upperclassmen, they weren't sure they were going to follow the rules, and the veterans got involved in it.

29:03.128 --> 29:06.973
And about half of the students at that time were veterans.

29:07.293 --> 29:10.998
So the core, it was about 50 percent core and about 50 percent veterans, something like that.

29:11.338 --> 29:17.126
And it was always great to have a veteran buddy because you had a place to hide out, which was, for a freshman, was very important.

29:17.766 --> 29:26.998
And I had some veterans from North Fort Worth, Jim Garrison and, well, there were several of them here.

29:27.805 --> 29:31.252
I would go over there and stay in their room.

29:31.913 --> 29:36.763
I'd go over there to study, but I'd usually wind up taking a nap, you know, because you couldn't sleep during the day.

29:37.584 --> 29:45.119
And that was one thing about one of my classmates was Jarvis Miller, who later became president of A&M.

29:46.101 --> 29:49.408
And Jarvis was in my outfit, and this was right at the beginning.

29:49.861 --> 29:56.049
They said that any time an upperclassman comes in your room, hit a brace, which is, you know, stand up straight and so forth.

29:57.010 --> 30:02.937
And so Jarvis was laying on his bed and an upperclassman came in and he hit a brace on his bed.

30:03.058 --> 30:05.601
Well, of course, they didn't think too much of that.

30:05.641 --> 30:16.054
And talking about braces, my grandmother, my grandmother Woodall, used to tell me about my uncle, how nice his posture was.

30:16.726 --> 30:21.130
And she said that was because they kept him in a brace down there at A&M for a long time.

30:22.491 --> 30:29.198
And so I thought that what that meant, there was some kind of brace that you wore when you came down here as a freshman.

30:29.218 --> 30:33.742
And I tried to envision this leather brace or canvas or what kind of brace this was.

30:33.882 --> 30:39.047
And for years, up until the time I actually came down here, I thought you had to wear a brace.

30:39.147 --> 30:44.792
But then I quickly found out what a brace was in the Corps.

30:46.527 --> 30:51.613
So, like I was saying, the hazing was really bad.

30:52.675 --> 30:55.578
In fact, they restricted us several weekends in a row.

30:55.679 --> 30:58.502
You know, we couldn't even get out of the dorm on Saturday and Sunday.

30:58.542 --> 31:00.905
We were restricted to our room for no reason.

31:02.427 --> 31:08.755
We had two sophomores that, you know, there were some sophomores you didn't like, and there were some you just almost hated.

31:08.835 --> 31:10.377
And we had one, J.W.

31:10.437 --> 31:15.724
Robinson was one, and his roommate was, I forget.
