WEBVTT

00:08.603 --> 00:17.537
Frank suggested that I go back and tell Frank Gould 
that we would do it his way. Do it Frank Gould's way?

00:19.223 --> 00:20.267
Yes. And it was Frank Gould that was the one who was 
first saying, don't use Webster. Right. And then

00:27.298 --> 00:28.560
Frank Wardlaw. The standard botanical practice 
was to run the words of the name together, like

00:28.580 --> 00:36.507
buffalo grass is all one word. And I insisted on 
breaking it into two words, because buffalo grass

00:36.547 --> 00:42.553
doesn't make much sense. Well, it does to the 
botanists. And so Frank Gould won the day on that

00:45.676 --> 00:50.541
one. I still think it looks funny every time I see 
those books, but who am I to insist that they change

00:50.825 --> 01:01.663
a whole range of literature. But I remember one of 
the things I said to Frank Gould, and I wish I could

01:03.807 --> 01:10.538
take it back now, he was really a great guy. And he 
must have gone home and laughed about it until he

01:11.699 --> 01:24.460
was sick, but I told him I didn't want to contribute 
to the Germanification of the English language.

01:24.480 --> 01:30.069
Cocky kid, I

01:24.480 --> 01:30.069
guess. As you're getting started here, what was 
your normal work schedule by the day and by the

01:36.218 --> 01:37.840
week. You got to, normally you got to the campus 
about what time and did what? Oh, yeah. Well, we

01:43.348 --> 01:44.750
worked from 8 to 5.

01:48.074 --> 01:50.037
Did you walk or drive? I drove. I lived over on 
Southwest Parkway in apartments over there. And

01:58.548 --> 01:59.810
so I drove. And parked? We parked We had some 
parking places right by the press there. There was

02:09.900 --> 02:13.106
a parking lot behind the building. And actually, 
it was on the street side of the building, but

02:13.447 --> 02:19.199
toward the rear. And then there was a parking 
garage, which the press used as the shipping room

02:20.141 --> 02:26.113
and the warehouse. That's where all the books were 
kept and shipped out from. But there was a little

02:29.577 --> 02:35.144
parking there, and I can't remember if I, I think 
though my parking was on the street. I think I had

02:35.625 --> 02:40.912
just the random street parking for many years. All 
right, was there a coffee pot at the Brass? Yeah.

02:47.400 --> 02:56.732
You know, we were right behind Sabisa, so we could 
also go over there sometimes for breaks, and then

02:47.400 --> 02:56.732
we were right across just a few hundred feet from 
campus corner, so we'd go down there. We used to go

03:03.294 --> 03:17.451
after work, we'd go to

03:03.294 --> 03:17.451
the Dixie Chicken or one of the other places down 
there and have a few beers. But we kind of grew out of

03:18.712 --> 03:21.175
that, I guess. Right, and then lunch would be 
where? Oh, I usually went home for lunch, had lunch

03:23.746 --> 03:31.716
at home with my wife, and then check the mail and 
then get back to work. And you never had to worry

03:31.736 --> 03:34.019
about your car being broken in? Oh, no, certainly 
not. The worst thing that ever happened was that

03:36.783 --> 03:46.175
one time I parked there and there was a fellow 
mowing the grass. I didn't pay much attention to

03:46.275 --> 03:47.877
it. When I came back out either for lunch or after 
work, Apparently his mower had hit a piece of rebar

03:53.142 --> 03:57.390
that was in the grass. It had gone right through the 
side window of my car. But I went to the university

04:00.656 --> 04:04.503
and told them about it, and they paid for it. No 
problem, no questions asked. And did the press

04:08.490 --> 04:13.219
staff do some things together? Yeah, we used to 
have... Really nice receptions for authors in the

04:18.775 --> 04:23.273
Wardlaw's residence. Frank and Rosemary's 
residence was only the second place on campus

04:28.276 --> 04:33.262
where liquor was allowed to be served. Can you 
describe how that came about? Well, I wasn't here

04:36.787 --> 04:47.900
then, of course, but I understand that that was one 
of the conditions that Frank put up on coming to

04:36.787 --> 04:47.900
Texas A&M, that he wanted to have a place. I mean, if 
he was going to live on campus, he wanted to be able

04:48.481 --> 04:58.013
to entertain guests and authors and have that kind 
of... reception for new books and new authors.

05:04.893 --> 05:08.757
That was one of the conditions he put on it, and 
apparently it was approved. I assume that the

05:09.739 --> 05:18.350
Board of Regents had to approve that, but I don't 
know the story really. Let me add to this a little

05:18.370 --> 05:24.257
bit of my own experience that I think might fit 
here. I was fairly new on the job as dean of

05:26.984 --> 05:47.338
faculties, and I got a call one Monday morning from 
Dr. Jack Williams, our president, telling me to

05:26.984 --> 05:47.338
stop what I was doing and to go over to the new 
Holiday Inn and pick up Frank and Rosemary Wardlaw

05:26.984 --> 05:47.338
and give them a tour of the campus. I said, oh, 
they're visiting here. And he said, well, he's the

05:49.935 --> 05:52.340
new director of the press. I said, press? How long 
have we had a press? He said, since yesterday

05:56.748 --> 06:03.842
afternoon when John and Sarah Lindsay got me and 
Margaret and Frank and Rosemary together. And he

06:04.649 --> 06:08.373
said, and you're the chairman of the Press Advisor 
Committee. And I said, oh, who's on the committee?

06:11.115 --> 06:13.778
And he said, you tell me who you want on there. But 
then he said, your job is to tour him around the

06:14.358 --> 06:18.102
campus. We've got to find a place to put the press. 
It had been recommended that it be located in that

06:21.105 --> 06:27.871
maroon and white building. Reed McDonald. In the 
Reed McDonald building. which I and others

06:31.312 --> 06:41.865
thought was among the least attractive buildings 
on the campus and the suggestion was the basement,

06:31.312 --> 06:41.865
the ground level, below ground level. We walked 
through it and Frank was noticeably turned off and

06:41.885 --> 06:59.547
I shared that opinion and we were driving 
elsewhere on the campus looking around and as we

06:41.885 --> 06:59.547
passed that big old board house he asked what it 
was. And I told him that that was the building where

07:00.252 --> 07:17.998
the board of, then board of directors, I don't know 
whether now they're regents, where they stayed

07:00.252 --> 07:17.998
when they came to their meeting and that they had 
new quarters over in the new wing of the Memorial

07:00.252 --> 07:17.998
Student Center and it was vacant. Well, he was much 
taken by that and I understand that he then

07:25.227 --> 07:36.528
broached the subject with Dr. Williams about 
putting the press there and he and Rosemary live

07:25.227 --> 07:36.528
downstairs and the press be upstairs. So as far as I 
know that's how that came to be and I had never heard

07:37.730 --> 07:48.349
of any other competitor for that place, so it was a 
very fine use for a pleasant old structure.

07:57.484 --> 08:04.916
Describe some of those Wardlaw-hosted social 
events for authors and others. They were

08:05.557 --> 08:06.399
wonderful. We had people in from all over Texas for 
those things, and of course Frank had been in Texas

08:13.574 --> 08:19.402
for 25 years or before, so he had lots of friends 
from around the state. We had people from like John

08:20.724 --> 08:37.506
Henry Falk and

08:20.724 --> 08:37.506
Mrs. Dobie used to come all the time to those 
receptions and parties. Well, she was also the

08:38.178 --> 08:44.108
former Mrs. Webb, I believe, right? Isn't she the 
one who was married to both men? No, no, no, no. She

08:51.221 --> 08:59.074
was Webb's widow and had been married to former 
Mayor and Congressman Maury Maverick. That's it,

08:59.295 --> 09:00.617
Maverick. That's right, you're right. No, I 
don't. Frank always called her the

09:02.832 --> 09:06.637
double-barreled widow. And as I recall, she 
always smiled over it. Yeah. And the folklore

09:12.684 --> 09:16.248
fiction writer from over in the Big Thicket? Bill 
Brett. Bill Brett. Yeah, now Bill didn't come

09:18.791 --> 09:25.960
along until 77, I

09:18.791 --> 09:25.960
think it was. He came in with his stories, or sent 
Frank those stories. and asked if we'd be

09:32.363 --> 09:34.347
interested. And

09:34.427 --> 09:40.979
stolen steers was the first thing he sent. Frank, I 
remember we all were talking about that. Frank

09:46.229 --> 09:52.060
said, I received this from this fellow over in the 
Big Thicket. He doesn't have any credentials, no

09:52.411 --> 09:58.982
education much, but it's a wonderful story. And he 
asked Margaret and me to read it and tell him what we

09:59.463 --> 10:02.708
thought. And we thought it was great, too, so we 
published it. And it was one of the best things we

10:09.119 --> 10:11.283
ever did, I think. Describe Mr. Brett. Old Bill was 
just an East Texas cowboy. He always said that he

10:17.909 --> 10:32.207
had been a postmaster and cowboy and oil hand and 
anything it took to raise a family.

10:32.247 --> 10:37.333
Was he a pleasant author to deal with, to work with? 
Oh, yeah. He had no preconceptions about what

10:38.615 --> 10:46.785
publishing should be or how he should be treated by 
the publisher and he just he came to us just as he

10:47.423 --> 11:10.073
dealt with anybody else in his life you know very 
straightforward and he's still he's still living

10:47.423 --> 11:10.073
he's we're in liberty county and understand his 
health's not too good so I think it'd be great for

11:10.525 --> 11:14.289
somebody to get his story before he's gone. As you 
are getting settled in as an editor, what were some

11:14.329 --> 11:24.158
of your learning experiences?

11:26.901 --> 11:29.263
Well, I told you about that one with Frank Gould. 
That was definitely a learning experience.

11:33.987 --> 11:39.773
I also learned a little bit more about Frank 
Wardlaw. type of manager he was. And I had promised

11:42.435 --> 11:53.926
Frank that I would stay for five years, because he 
didn't want to have to replace me sooner than that.

11:54.907 --> 11:56.489
He just wanted some continuity. And so I promised 
him that I would stay at the press for five years. So

12:01.974 --> 12:09.962
after I'd been here for a couple of years, I found 
out that he was planning to retire in 78. So he was

12:10.837 --> 12:13.059
going to be leaving sooner than I was. And also 
found that after a couple of tries that he wanted me

12:14.260 --> 12:28.614
to do my job, my part of the team, and that he 
appreciated my suggestions for acquisitions.

12:28.734 --> 12:35.661
But unless it was something that really caught his 
attention, it probably was not going to be

12:28.734 --> 12:35.661
encouraged.

12:38.664 --> 12:39.865
Frank was... I

12:41.161 --> 12:46.666
don't know if there's a word for it. I can't think of 
a word for it. He was an autocrat, but one in a very

12:47.988 --> 12:51.291
nice way. He ran the operation. He ran the show. And

12:56.696 --> 13:00.780
that was that. If you weren't hired to be the 
associate director of the press, He really didn't

13:09.967 --> 13:13.192
expect any input from you in that regard. You were 
hired to do your job and you did it. But he was a

13:16.877 --> 13:39.231
wonderfully congenial manager and always was 
able to

13:16.877 --> 13:39.231
talk to people and encourage them and make them 
feel like they were the most important person at

13:16.877 --> 13:39.231
the press.

13:39.548 --> 13:41.371
he had a wonderful way with people. Can you 
remember some examples of his sense of humor? Oh

13:47.540 --> 13:51.226
yeah, but I can't repeat those for recording.

13:54.150 --> 14:00.460
One of the most memorable stories he ever told me 
was just had to do with Wreck of a Circus Train. I

14:02.333 --> 14:05.476
really shouldn't repeat that one on tape. Wreck of 
a Circus Train. This was before you came to A&M, or

14:07.678 --> 14:09.780
after? This was just a funny story he told. Oh, just 
a funny story. It was one night after one of those

14:15.686 --> 14:17.688
parties. As I was leaving, he told me... And the 
parties quite often lasted how long? To what

14:25.015 --> 14:25.696
hours? Oh, well... You know, if it was just the 
bunch of us,

14:29.482 --> 14:39.979
just the press crew, it could go on into the wee 
hours of the morning. Generally, though, if it was

14:40.800 --> 14:53.181
an official reception or press autographing or 
just a party to honor one of the authors, it would

14:40.800 --> 14:53.181
usually break up fairly early, midnight, 1 
o'clock. Don't I remember John Henry Falk being

14:57.325 --> 15:01.891
one of the people able to go on hour after hour after 
hour. Oh, yes. Yeah. And one party was at Margaret

15:04.674 --> 15:12.103
Ingram's house, and John Henry Falk and Bill Brett 
were both there. And they started trading

15:13.165 --> 15:17.150
stories, and that did go on for hours. But it was 
just fascinating. Fascinating to hear them

15:22.317 --> 15:24.719
trading stories with each other. As you worked for 
Frank, did you become aware of any no-no's? That

15:34.009 --> 15:39.435
no, this will not, he will not approve this or that 
or something? Oh, yeah. He had a very strong sense

15:42.478 --> 15:51.227
of what Texans wanted to read. and what they would 
not tolerate in their books. And we turned down a

15:55.440 --> 16:01.977
couple of books that had included stories that he 
felt were not something that the Texas audience

16:03.830 --> 16:13.582
for regional books would tolerate. What were 
those? One of them was... Well, what were those

16:14.904 --> 16:18.168
guidelines? Well, the guidelines were just the 
kind of language that was used in the book. That the

16:23.155 --> 16:24.616
language was too strong? Right, right. 
Four-letter words were out.

16:33.682 --> 16:37.106
And Dirty Stories were definitely out. One of 
those books was published by the University of

16:38.367 --> 16:46.497
Illinois Press just before I left there. It was one 
that Frank had turned down at the University of

16:46.517 --> 16:53.185
Texas Press. But it ended up at Illinois, and 
Illinois had no problem with it. And the title of it

16:58.671 --> 17:03.537
was Pissing in the Snow, Another Ozark Folk Tales. 
that that was one that Frank turned down because he

17:04.681 --> 17:20.298
didn't think that the market for Texas books would 
support a book like that. And in fact, he thought

17:20.938 --> 17:27.625
that there would be a negative reaction to a book 
with a title like that and those kinds of stories in

17:20.938 --> 17:27.625
it. What do you think were his favorite topics, 
favorite subject areas generally? Oh, I think, of

17:35.326 --> 17:40.433
course, the art books he loved. He loved to publish 
art. He loved art. They had beautiful art

17:43.858 --> 17:47.843
throughout their apartment. And on every wall, 
you'd see these paintings by Texas artists that

17:49.105 --> 17:56.275
were just fabulous. And so I think the opportunity 
to come here to Texas A&M and the connection with

18:02.596 --> 18:31.101
joe and betty moore who funded the start of the 
texas art series i think it was just perfect it was

18:02.596 --> 18:31.101
serendipity and and frank had found a niche that he 
wanted to publish in he really enjoyed and he had

18:02.596 --> 18:31.101
the funding to do it i think it was just perfect the 
circumstances were just right now had that had

18:02.596 --> 18:31.101
that uh link with uh the moore's already happened 
before you got here yes okay so the Mondale Rogers

18:31.469 --> 18:58.489
book was was done that was that was in the works when 
I know let me think I think I copy edited the Mondale

18:31.469 --> 18:58.489
Rogers because if I'm not I believe that was one 
that came here or more after I got here because

18:31.469 --> 18:58.489
that's the manuscript that was placed before He's 
the one, the Westex's scenes. That's the one

19:02.430 --> 19:08.565
placed before Joe Moore because he was president 
of the former students that year. That's the one,

19:10.510 --> 19:12.194
right. That was the first one in the series. Let me 
add my recollection of that to this tape. Dr.

19:21.179 --> 19:38.905
Williams and Bob Walker were going to call on J. 
Harold Dunn up in Amarillo, looking for a

19:21.179 --> 19:38.905
meaningful contribution to Texas A&M. And Mr. 
Dunn, something to the effect, as I recall, he

19:40.067 --> 19:44.153
said, Everything I've got is in cattle oil and 
cotton, and right now the prices on those are down,

19:44.521 --> 19:53.992
and I would really like to help with this, and 
particularly they showed him this manuscript.

19:55.794 --> 19:56.735
That would interest me. It's Texas art, and it's 
West Texas, but I just can't right now. And Dr.

20:01.920 --> 20:09.769
Williams said, well, while we're in the 
university plane, let's stop in Midland and visit

20:01.920 --> 20:09.769
with Joe Moore, president of former students, 
just to say hello. And as I recall, Joe Moore, what

20:10.711 --> 20:13.815
are you all doing? Where have you been? Well, we've 
been in Amarillo talking to J. Harold Dunn. What

20:18.301 --> 20:18.822
about? Well, we had this manuscript, old 
manuscript. About what? Well, the West Texas Art.

20:23.529 --> 20:24.189
Well, let me see it. I'm interested in West Texas 
Art. And then he invited us to stay and have supper.

20:33.102 --> 20:35.044
And he had shared it with Betty by then. They were 
interested. could spend the night. Spend the

20:39.153 --> 20:52.186
night, and the next morning at breakfast, if I'm 
not mistaken, they committed a larger sum to endow

20:39.153 --> 20:52.186
the series than they'd been talking. I left 
Wardlaw out of this trip. Wardlaw and Williams,

20:54.409 --> 20:59.454
and I think Bob Walker. But anyway, the gift, the 
commitment to support it was larger than the

20:59.814 --> 21:07.482
original expectation. any other special that you 
thought were his pet subjects other than art?

21:15.195 --> 21:22.020
Well, of course, the Texas regional history was 
always a favorite

21:15.195 --> 21:22.020
of his. And I think he'd been interested in Texas 
history since he had come to Texas, I think. And he

21:32.649 --> 21:34.131
knew the market for it. He knew that those books 
would sell. He knew he had... the support of the

21:38.849 --> 21:57.449
Texas State Historical Association and in 
getting

21:38.849 --> 21:57.449
in free publicity more or less, free advertising 
for those books, so I think that was always a great

21:38.849 --> 21:57.449
topic for. All right, and then at the other end of 
the spectrum, what were his least favorite

21:57.469 --> 22:04.317
topics?

22:07.638 --> 22:09.701
Well, you know, I don't really know. I know that we 
published a couple of books that we just sort of had

22:09.721 --> 22:23.738
to do because they were by faculty members and they 
were orphans, really, because we didn't have any

22:09.721 --> 22:23.738
way to market them nationally. And

22:23.798 --> 22:37.054
Frank would sometimes complain about those that 
didn't really seem to have a place on our list, but

22:23.798 --> 22:37.054
he felt that we were obligated to do them. and I 
won't give specifics because those authors may

22:38.384 --> 22:55.789
still be around, but there were some of those that 
didn't seem to be anyone's favorite, really, but

22:38.384 --> 22:55.789
the press had to support the faculty and publish 
them. Right. As you were in those early years, give

22:56.210 --> 23:05.303
some examples you can think of, recall, where you 
felt you had really done it the way the boss wanted

23:05.941 --> 23:08.824
it done? You felt good about his reaction to your 
work?

23:17.672 --> 23:26.300
Well, practically every book that

23:17.672 --> 23:26.300
we did, he supported the staff. He never, I don't 
remember a single time that Frank criticized any

23:27.141 --> 23:35.509
member of the staff. for anything in any of the 
books i can't think of a time never never even

23:35.978 --> 24:03.117
thought about it really but i can't he just wasn't 
that kind of manager he would emphasize the

23:35.978 --> 24:03.117
positives but never criticize the negatives and 
so he was always very positive about what we

23:35.978 --> 24:03.117
published and if Any new book that came along, he 
would just

24:04.733 --> 24:12.182
laud everybody for it. Do you remember any, 
whether it was one that you had edited or not, do you

24:13.544 --> 24:30.744
remember any in those early years when there was a 
mistake in the printed, an oversight, and then the

24:13.544 --> 24:30.744
printed copy there was? Oh, I don't remember. I 
know there must have been some. No typos, no

24:35.783 --> 24:37.645
misspellings? No books perfect, so I can't 
remember specific instruments from way back

24:38.707 --> 24:45.395
then. I

24:45.935 --> 24:53.725
usually try to forget about those things as soon as 
possible and not make those mistakes again. In

24:53.745 --> 25:01.875
your early books, which one did you personally 
enjoy the most in the early years?

25:03.712 --> 25:31.339
just more fun to do yeah well of course the stolen 
steers so you edited that one yeah and um how much

25:03.712 --> 25:31.339
editing did it take well quite a bit uh actually 
margaret i think margaret did the first copy

25:03.712 --> 25:31.339
editing on that yeah that was yeah that was done by 
margaret ingram but i uh handled the proof on it and

25:03.712 --> 25:31.339
uh worked with bill on it It

25:33.108 --> 25:46.848
required quite a bit of copy editing, and it 
required a special touch because it was so close to

25:33.108 --> 25:46.848
fiction. Well, it was fiction, really, although 
we labeled it as folklore. But that kind of

25:51.754 --> 25:56.962
fiction, you don't want to over-edit. You can't 
over-edit because there's so much of the author's

25:57.583 --> 26:02.710
voice in it. over at it, then it starts to sound 
wooden and stilted. So, yeah, I took a special hand

26:07.489 --> 26:13.515
to work with that. Were there colloquial 
spellings, Texas pronunciation spellings? Oh,

26:17.920 --> 26:18.260
yeah. Yeah. Now, what would be the guideline for 
that? Well,

26:22.465 --> 26:30.874
you have to keep the author's voice and keep the 
sound of the dialect, but make it readable. There

26:43.504 --> 26:50.476
are some books of dialect that are so heavy that you 
can't really read them easily. You have to work to

26:50.556 --> 26:53.381
get that dialect. Now, if you're a native speaker, 
then you can read right along with it, but I'm

26:53.461 --> 26:58.009
talking about Most of the people that you want to 
sell the book to, that you want to read that book,

26:58.681 --> 27:05.389
are they going to be able to read it easily? And so we 
had to tone down some of the dialect in Bill Brett's

27:06.710 --> 27:11.276
books. Did you have to kind of almost compose a 
reference dictionary to be sure that you were

27:12.057 --> 27:20.727
spelling this colloquial term the same way each 
time? Yeah, that was part of the style sheet.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.098
Certainly. For a book like that, you put together a 
style sheet of the spellings and punctuation, and

27:25.578 --> 27:35.768
you follow that through the whole book. And in that 
case, yes, the odd spellings, like do you spell O-L

27:36.369 --> 27:50.743
apostrophe

27:36.369 --> 27:50.743
or O-L-E?

27:51.331 --> 28:01.522
I presume, would not use a linguistics 
professor's style of accenting and spelling. No,

28:01.723 --> 28:03.164
not at all. In those early years,

28:03.404 --> 28:20.123
when you got to the office and started to work at 
about 8 o'clock, about how long could you work

28:03.404 --> 28:20.123
without any interruption or break before you had 
to get up and Take a stroll, maybe? Oh, first couple

28:22.350 --> 28:29.698
of hours, and then we'd take a break for coffee and 
chit chat and get back to work. So you could sit

28:29.718 --> 28:30.559
there? The editors are notoriously easygoing 
about office hours and always have been. And so

28:40.151 --> 28:50.683
we'd get up and visit each other in our offices and 
discuss particular problems of grammar or

28:40.151 --> 28:50.683
punctuation.

28:51.659 --> 28:56.104
So it wasn't all just focusing on the papers right 
in front of us. In those early years, if you came to a

28:56.685 --> 29:04.134
situation where you wanted someone else's 
comment, to whom did you turn? To Margaret. To

29:06.337 --> 29:07.018
Margaret? Mainly.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.747
If it was a really big problem, then we would go 
directly to Frank. But if it was a matter of style or

29:15.909 --> 29:20.434
punctuation, spelling, that kind of thing, And I 
couldn't resolve it with my references. And

29:23.391 --> 29:25.294
Margaret and I would discuss it. And sometimes she 
would come to me and ask me about things that were

29:25.755 --> 29:32.524
troublesome to her. Now, to show how times have 
changed, I'm assuming in that era, people smoked

29:33.645 --> 29:38.913
if they wanted to in the office. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. 
What percentage of smokers were there in the press

29:42.297 --> 29:44.881
then? Practically everybody.

29:48.983 --> 29:50.185
Margaret and I smoked. Ray Gromyla smoked like a 
chimney. Don Collins probably outsmoked the rest

29:54.110 --> 29:57.153
of us. And then, of course, Frank had his cigars and 
pipes going all the time. I tried to stop smoking in

30:02.981 --> 30:05.845
77. That was about two years after I'd come here. 
And my wife had quit when our daughter, She first

30:15.190 --> 30:17.853
found out she was pregnant with our daughter. So 
she had been quit for about four years. And I

30:20.957 --> 30:24.221
thought, I need to stop this. I was smoking way too 
much. And so I started buying cigars, too. I'd get

30:33.173 --> 30:38.279
these little cigarillos in the little six packs or 
whatever. And I'd get one of those and take it to the

30:39.381 --> 30:43.746
press. instead of cigarettes and then portion 
those out through the day. And then gradually I was

30:49.393 --> 30:58.045
able to cut down on the number that I smoked each day 
and finally quit that way. But it was tough to quit

30:59.186 --> 31:06.096
because everybody was smoking up a storm. There'd 
be a haze in that building so thick you couldn't cut

31:07.517 --> 31:11.623
it with a knife sometimes. Like I, as a non-smoker, 
I don't remember ever thinking that that area or

31:13.375 --> 31:26.815
any other area, oh my goodness, I've got to watch 
out because I'm going over where everybody

31:13.375 --> 31:26.815
smokes. It was just so common. Oh, yeah. Even in 
restaurants and so on, people smoked all the time.

31:32.884 --> 31:33.886
We didn't pay any. I understand it's still that way 
in Europe. So my wife and I want to get back to Europe

31:36.169 --> 31:40.716
one of these days where we...
