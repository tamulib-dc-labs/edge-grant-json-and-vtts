00:02.005 --> 00:03.729
I have heard of Uncle Ed's.

00:04.711 --> 00:06.354
Tell me, what had you heard?

00:06.454 --> 00:12.266
Well, I just, you know, stories from my husband and his friends before I came.

00:12.426 --> 00:16.635
I mean, Uncle Ed's was a place where the kids did go right.

00:17.817 --> 00:18.639
And what did they do at all?

00:18.659 --> 00:22.647
Well, I think they just drank beers, but I think they did.

00:22.762 --> 00:27.508
As far as I can learn, it wasn't terribly wild or anything, but you could... Just a beer joint, wasn't it?

00:27.528 --> 00:31.574
It was a beer joint, and apparently they knew what the rules were.

00:32.635 --> 00:36.760
Some rode in a car, others walked down to Uncle Ed's room.

00:36.781 --> 00:37.401
Oh, is that right?

00:38.623 --> 00:40.545
Yeah, when you all went to the movie, where'd you go?

00:41.707 --> 00:42.708
Right over here to Northgate.

00:42.869 --> 00:43.449
At the campus.

00:43.770 --> 00:44.851
Right, we sure did.

00:45.933 --> 00:48.516
And of course, we went to...

00:49.120 --> 00:51.924
what was it called, where they showed, you've never been licked?

00:52.925 --> 00:53.365
Guy and Hall.

00:53.385 --> 00:54.727
Guy and Hall, we went there.

00:54.787 --> 00:58.792
That was a ritual, you went to that every year to see that movie.

00:59.714 --> 01:03.619
It was wonderful the way the eggs reacted to it and everything.

01:04.279 --> 01:04.980
Do they still do that?

01:05.421 --> 01:06.662
I think so, I think so.

01:07.123 --> 01:09.045
And then we went over to, what was it?

01:09.206 --> 01:10.147
The Grove.

01:11.108 --> 01:16.495
The movies were what, you got in for 25 cents or your student ID or something.

01:17.572 --> 01:24.740
Let's see, how often did y'all go out of town while you were students here?

01:26.882 --> 01:27.663
Not very often.

01:27.763 --> 01:36.933
I think I remember once when we first, when I first came, we went to a ball game at, in Fort Worth at TCU football game.

01:37.714 --> 01:45.402
But usually we just, we were here and went home at Christmas time and that was about the only time.

01:46.647 --> 01:52.916
Describe, if you can, describe what College Station was physically.

01:52.977 --> 01:56.221
Where, how big did it seem to be?

01:56.282 --> 01:57.784
It didn't seem very big to me at all.

01:58.265 --> 02:02.391
It was, now I thought Bryan was big.

02:03.873 --> 02:08.280
But College Station itself was not much.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.845
Do you remember buying any groceries to speak of in College Station?

02:13.580 --> 02:15.144
No, we went to that Wine Gardens.

02:15.766 --> 02:17.650
I guess that's all the way into Bryan, isn't it?

02:17.791 --> 02:19.435
Yeah, that's where we usually went.

02:20.217 --> 02:23.465
That Wine Gardens, of course, ceased existing good many years ago.

02:23.485 --> 02:27.977
It was down where Texas Avenue curved to the northeast.

02:29.358 --> 02:43.873
Let's see, while y'all were here, do you remember any off-campus national or international events that caused you and your husband to kind of pause and reflect on how those events might affect you?

02:44.275 --> 02:47.280
Oh, yeah, because there was all, I mean, the 60s were a bad time.

02:48.382 --> 03:01.744
And there was a lot of, I think that's why I just kind of break up when I think about these young men I was in class with, because a lot of college campuses were riots and, I mean,

03:03.260 --> 03:05.644
I never was against the Vietnam War.

03:05.744 --> 03:09.331
I mean, I thought that if that's what our government thought we should do, that that's what we should do.

03:09.411 --> 03:16.724
I guess I'm just a follower, but I just thought if they're sending our boys, we should be supporting that.

03:17.666 --> 03:20.070
But it was a different mentality at Texas A&M.

03:20.050 --> 03:25.359
You did not have people protesting, or if you did, we never saw it.

03:26.221 --> 03:27.303
We did not have that.

03:28.365 --> 03:31.871
It was country, motherhood and God in Texas A&M.

03:32.331 --> 03:34.956
Do you think it was more so here than at Tech?

03:37.000 --> 03:42.970
I think that there was probably things at Tech that I did not see at Texas A&M.

03:43.591 --> 03:51.444
Because I'm assuming that in some ways the student body there and here would come from similar backgrounds.

03:51.745 --> 04:00.840
Right, but you've got to remember at Texas Tech, if you were not in a sorority or a fraternity, you were not in.

04:01.613 --> 04:04.497
And you never had that at Texas A&M.

04:05.077 --> 04:11.145
I mean, we did not see things on our campus like other places did.

04:12.287 --> 04:15.451
You know, the people in the right gear came in to put the crowds down.

04:15.551 --> 04:16.772
I mean, we didn't have that.

04:16.812 --> 04:17.273
Sure.

04:18.695 --> 04:21.859
School spirit here compared to Tech.

04:22.359 --> 04:24.082
I'm not trying to... There's no comparison.

04:24.782 --> 04:28.347
I mean, I've been bleeding maroon for a long time.

04:28.883 --> 04:41.961
In fact, my middle little daughter said to my mother one time when we were driving through Lubbock, my mother said to her, she was about four and she was acting up, she said, Joni, your mother went to school right here.

04:42.001 --> 04:48.090
We were passing by and my little Joni says, does daddy know she went there?

04:50.922 --> 04:55.490
Let's see, your husband must have had some close buddies.

04:56.832 --> 05:07.210
And what did you as a young wife and mother, you and those buddies, how did the friendships get built stronger?

05:07.966 --> 05:15.093
I tell you, it's just absolutely amazing about those friendships.

05:15.513 --> 05:18.576
We have been back and forth from West Texas to Houston twice.

05:19.797 --> 05:26.043
Our friendships pick right back up just like they were in 1963 or four or five.

05:28.526 --> 05:35.172
They're still, I would say he still considers those guys his best friends.

05:35.152 --> 05:38.517
We meet for tailgates before football games.

05:41.261 --> 05:46.148
I mean, it's just amazing the bond that grows between these people.

05:48.271 --> 05:49.452
What builds that bond?

05:49.472 --> 05:50.293
I do not know.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.376
If we could bottle it, we could be rich.

05:53.538 --> 05:57.784
I mean, it's just amazing.

05:59.165 --> 06:01.448
It's just, it doesn't go away.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.890
And we got so tickled.

06:02.930 --> 06:06.736
It was before a game this last fall.

06:06.856 --> 06:13.645
Well, there was, I guess, five couples of us sitting around a table at the MSC waiting to go to the ball game.

06:13.725 --> 06:19.313
And we were talking about, of all things, social security, retirement, and grandbabies.

06:19.634 --> 06:21.737
And we laughed and said, whoever thought?

06:22.998 --> 06:26.944
And see, we're still, I mean, you're just, you just can't put your finger on it.

06:27.717 --> 06:41.371
Now, I think partly it is midnight Yale practice, football games, muster, silver taps, commencements.

06:42.893 --> 06:43.714
That's part of it.

06:44.635 --> 06:47.017
But some of the rest of it is more mysterious.

06:47.037 --> 06:47.798
Yes, it is.

06:47.818 --> 06:51.202
It's very, it's the spirit.

06:52.643 --> 06:56.307
Now, some of these friends, were they high school friends?

06:56.287 --> 07:05.095
Well, right, you know, Ted was, of course, we were, Ted and Coker and I were all in the same high school class, and yes, and that's family, too.

07:05.115 --> 07:06.096
But then there were some others.

07:06.116 --> 07:07.657
But there's others.

07:09.178 --> 07:26.293
And, in fact, there's one that he was raised in Bryan, and he became friends, and, of a friend, and now he's just a very good friend of my husband, and another one that was from Liberty, Texas, and, I mean, it's just,

07:26.273 --> 07:28.816
You know, it's just amazing, the bond.

07:29.917 --> 07:35.344
And we ran into a friend that we had not seen in years and years and years this last fall.

07:36.725 --> 07:42.132
And it seemed like that the friendship just connected back up, just like we'd seen them the week before.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.554
So you didn't graduate here?

07:44.574 --> 07:45.355
No, I did not.

07:45.596 --> 07:46.737
I need 28 hours.

07:48.379 --> 07:50.982
As y'all were getting ready to leave

07:51.974 --> 07:52.977
for that first job.

07:54.420 --> 07:57.368
Did A&M play a role in helping get that first job?

07:57.468 --> 07:58.170
No, they did not.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.383
My husband did not have a job.

08:03.784 --> 08:08.937
I remember that there were some people that came to interview, but not

08:09.507 --> 08:13.332
that many, and I'm not sure, I don't remember what the help was available.

08:14.975 --> 08:22.706
We packed our U-Haul again, and this time we had all of the things we started with, plus a baby bed and a rocker, and a high chair.

08:23.407 --> 08:30.677
And we went back, and my husband, we went to Andrews, and my husband went to a personnel service in Odessa.

08:31.679 --> 08:35.464
And that's how we... Ended up with the job in Andrews.

08:36.052 --> 08:38.174
What kind of world did you all think you were going?

08:38.214 --> 08:40.576
Was it just back like it had been?

08:40.616 --> 08:43.679
Well, you know, it hadn't changed much.

08:43.699 --> 08:46.042
We'd only been gone a few years and it hadn't changed much.

08:46.902 --> 08:52.688
How well prepared did you all think he was for that A&M?

08:52.828 --> 08:54.750
How well prepared had A&M made him?

08:55.170 --> 08:56.511
I think he was very well prepared.

08:57.032 --> 08:57.813
He did very well.

08:58.734 --> 09:03.358
What was it that A&M provided in that preparation?

09:04.638 --> 09:20.177
Well, they provided, of course, knowledge that he needed to do a job, but they also provided the know-how to be a team player and to be a leader also.

09:20.217 --> 09:25.363
And he did very well.

09:29.917 --> 09:37.351
One of my questions, the qualities of being an Aggie, what are the qualities of being an Aggie?

09:37.371 --> 09:38.694
I don't know, it's just in your heart.

09:40.558 --> 09:47.952
I mean, I'm as at a loss for words for that as anything I can think of.

09:48.353 --> 09:49.495
It's just something.

09:50.470 --> 09:52.252
that you either have or you don't have.

09:52.272 --> 09:57.158
Alright, now did you have that feeling before you arrived here as a young girl?

09:57.178 --> 09:59.380
No, but I got it the first week I was here.

10:00.041 --> 10:00.221
What?

10:01.603 --> 10:12.495
I don't know, it was just, even though I felt like they did not want women here, they never, I mean they were always polite and respectful,

10:12.998 --> 10:15.821
I mean, it was like their mama told them they were supposed to be polite to girls.

10:16.642 --> 10:18.404
And they were not forgetting that little bit.

10:18.424 --> 10:26.372
As you visited over the years, did you begin to see that change warmer toward women?

10:27.874 --> 10:29.235
Yes, I think so.

10:31.578 --> 10:36.643
It was...

10:37.214 --> 10:39.256
It was a real gradual thing, I think.

10:39.316 --> 10:53.230
I don't think that, you know, I mean, I was gone for a while, but now when you come back, you know, you see, I mean, everybody's just like, it's just hard to describe.

10:53.270 --> 10:55.892
Did you all go to Bonfire that first fall?

10:56.273 --> 10:57.955
No, it was canceled.

11:00.497 --> 11:05.262
I know why it was canceled, but... The death of our president caused it to be canceled.

11:05.402 --> 11:06.563
What did you and your...

11:07.218 --> 11:11.484
That was a shocking thing to us, very shocking.

11:13.326 --> 11:21.758
We had, my husband had an accounting lab on Friday afternoon, and on Friday afternoons, I went to the laundromat while he was there.

11:21.838 --> 11:29.969
And I will never forget, we were at the circle, waiting our turn to go, and it came on the radio.

11:30.009 --> 11:31.190
It was about 5 till 1.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.432
His class started at 1.

11:33.931 --> 11:45.674
And the announcer said that the president had been shot with a shot coming from the grassy knoll at Dealey Plaza, I believe it's called.

11:45.694 --> 11:47.257
And we were just, we just looked at each other.

11:47.277 --> 11:51.265
We could not believe this was happening.

11:52.477 --> 11:54.862
Of course, media was not like it is today.

11:55.844 --> 11:57.368
So I took him on to class.

11:57.428 --> 11:57.889
I let him out.

11:57.909 --> 12:00.515
I'll pick you up at 3.30, just like we always do.

12:00.815 --> 12:04.263
And I went on to the laundromat, came back home.

12:04.965 --> 12:08.292
And it was on the radio coming from the laundromat.

12:08.558 --> 12:17.890
The president had been shot, and I mean, I was shocked, but I wasn't a news junkie, I guess, like I am now.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.034
I would have immediately turned the television set on, but I didn't even do that.

12:22.316 --> 12:30.306
But it was a very somber thing, and I mean, just like it ripped the heart out of Aggies.

12:32.108 --> 12:33.610
It was just shocking is what it was.

12:34.992 --> 12:36.574
But the bonfire was canceled that year.

12:39.136 --> 12:44.761
I had had a class, 12 to 1 class, and I heard it when I walked out of class.

12:45.782 --> 12:59.956
Two or three of us were going to hurry over to the MSC and beat the student rush to eat in the cafeteria, and my buddy was listening to the radio, and I was trying to hurry up, and he said, I'm listening to the radio, and I said, you can listen to that later, and he said, listen.

13:01.117 --> 13:07.303
And the first I heard were Walter Cronkite's words, I've just been handed a note, the president is dead.

13:07.638 --> 13:15.807
and I was stunned and one of the things that stunned me was it happened in the county seat where I had been born.

13:16.528 --> 13:20.752
The fact that it happened in Texas made it even worse.

13:22.775 --> 13:34.968
But I think because of that first news broadcast that I heard that the shot was fired from the Grassy Knoll, I will always believe that that's where the shot came from.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.611
I mean nobody's going to change my mind I don't think.

13:38.941 --> 13:46.190
Let's see, how did you learn Aggie traditions?

13:46.390 --> 13:48.073
Oh, my husband taught me.

13:48.093 --> 13:48.713
Yes, he did.

13:48.733 --> 13:53.820
You know, when the young leaders would do that, he said, this is so-and-so, Jane, this is so-and-so.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.081
So he literally did?

13:55.101 --> 13:56.583
Oh, yeah, he was my teacher.

13:56.784 --> 13:57.705
He was your teacher, okay.

13:58.626 --> 14:03.132
Do you remember any time when you goofed and did the wrong thing?

14:03.172 --> 14:07.497
No, I really don't, because he always would help me.

14:07.898 --> 14:10.602
until I could do it on my own and he would always help me.

14:13.046 --> 14:23.322
Diversity, were there, as you went to class or walked down the hallway, did you notice students that were not Anglo-Saxon Protestants?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.023
Not very many.

14:24.844 --> 14:27.949
It was just like I said, you know,

14:29.077 --> 14:34.162
Middle Easterner, Egypt, and really, I didn't ever see them at school.

14:35.023 --> 14:37.165
I mean, I saw them at home, I didn't see them at school.

14:37.185 --> 14:42.371
What about some, did you see some notice Hispanic students, whether they were Texans or not?

14:42.391 --> 14:45.494
Oh, maybe a few, but not very many.

14:46.475 --> 14:48.777
And I would have to say that that's probably changed for the better.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.262
Any black students that you?

14:54.642 --> 14:58.727
I do not remember any black students at A&M.

14:59.287 --> 15:05.134
I do remember one black student was in a class at Tech, but I do not remember any black ones.

15:12.683 --> 15:13.124
Let's see.

15:13.144 --> 15:16.988
As you all were getting ready to leave, how well prepared did you think you all were?

15:17.474 --> 15:19.277
I think my husband was very well prepared.

15:22.543 --> 15:24.987
What have we left out that I should have?

15:25.027 --> 15:28.273
Not much, because I told you I didn't have much.

15:29.475 --> 15:33.542
I think one of the things that really will always be in my mind is

15:33.522 --> 15:45.810
that during those terrible, terrible times of the 60s, that we on the Texas A&M campus were not exposed to the bad things that were happening around us.

15:46.852 --> 15:48.055
We just didn't have that.

15:48.997 --> 15:55.023
Did you, were you aware of any young women here who saw themselves as crusaders?

15:55.044 --> 15:57.666
No, no, not any.

15:57.726 --> 16:00.830
And a women's limb had not reared its head yet.

16:01.651 --> 16:07.957
I mean, there was some, but not, you didn't hear about it very, I mean, it was a way out there thing.

16:07.997 --> 16:12.102
Just like there would be no place for us to go between classes, you know.

16:12.843 --> 16:14.585
I mean, we just accepted it.

16:14.605 --> 16:15.966
That's the way it was.

16:16.908 --> 16:29.630
I love to tell the first student body officer, female, was a very, very bright biology major, or maybe biochemistry major, young lady from Columbia, Missouri.

16:29.970 --> 16:34.739
I later, when I went up there, I learned her father was a true world-class plant geneticist.

16:35.340 --> 16:41.430
Her name was Barbara Sears, and about 10 years after you were here, she ran for student body secretary.

16:41.815 --> 16:46.665
The voting booth was inside the west door of Cushing Library.

16:47.647 --> 16:47.747
Okay.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.892
She had very attractive eyes.

16:50.313 --> 16:54.943
She very carefully did her eye makeup that day, had on a good-looking dress.

16:54.983 --> 16:57.107
She stood on the steps, had a little bitty

16:57.087 --> 17:17.637
like business cards, and as every student walked by, she would look at them and hand them one of her cards that said, Barbara Sears, Student Body Secretary, and she would very softly say, would you vote for me, and would blink her eyes, and I teased her about that two years ago when she was back on campus, and she said, yes, that's what I did.

17:17.677 --> 17:18.538
How funny.

17:18.518 --> 17:20.140
How funny.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.263
But now, of course, there have been a number of.

17:22.443 --> 17:23.004
Oh, yeah.

17:23.204 --> 17:24.526
And women are just as capable.

17:24.746 --> 17:25.487
Sure, sure.

17:26.348 --> 17:27.770
Just as capable.

17:27.790 --> 17:28.351
Let's see.

17:32.296 --> 17:38.704
What effect did you have your experience, the fact that you all went to NM, what effect does that have on your lives?

17:39.967 --> 17:47.139
Well, I think that no matter where you are, if somebody sees that Aggie ring on my husband's hand, you probably see a friend.

17:47.780 --> 17:49.984
I mean, it's just amazing.

17:50.024 --> 17:54.731
And I guess that's really a sad thing for me that I did not go ahead and finish.

17:55.994 --> 17:57.957
I mean, I've never regretted my life at all.

17:57.977 --> 18:04.708
I mean, I've had a wonderful life, but there's just something about that, being an Aggie, just something about it.

18:06.730 --> 18:29.792
Next to last question, if someone gave you and your husband a check for a million dollars and had only one requirement in it that you had to pass it on to Texas A&M, but you could decide what they would do with that money, what would you have a, if you could make a big gift A&M, what would you want it to be to do to help?

18:29.812 --> 18:30.312
To help?

18:31.253 --> 18:31.614
I don't know.

18:31.634 --> 18:35.337
I've always thought that the endowed scholarships were wonderful.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.777
I mean, I think that opens up.

18:37.958 --> 18:46.408
Would you want to restrict them in any way as to major or geography or grades?

18:47.630 --> 18:50.173
Well, I don't know.

18:50.213 --> 19:01.307
You know, sometimes there are kids who are very capable and come from families who can't afford to send them, and they are left out.

19:01.810 --> 19:03.292
So you're saying?

19:03.312 --> 19:09.158
I mean, I'm just saying that sometimes the scale falls a little the other way, you know.

19:09.198 --> 19:16.907
I know, see, and in our family, all of our children were educated at Angelo State.

19:18.389 --> 19:21.132
And my girls each got academic scholarships.

19:21.352 --> 19:24.476
We could well afford to pay their way, but it was wonderful.

19:25.056 --> 19:27.379
I mean, it was kind of icing on their cake, you know.

19:29.992 --> 19:32.955
And there's so much out there for disadvantaged.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.898
Oh, yes.

19:36.918 --> 19:37.218
Yes.

19:37.238 --> 19:38.099
Last question then.

19:38.840 --> 19:43.424
What feelings do you hold for Texas A&M in your heart?

19:43.444 --> 19:45.165
Oh, I love them.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.206
I love them.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.047
Yeah.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.848
I just wouldn't take for my experiences.

19:49.629 --> 19:52.992
And I guess the only regret I have is I didn't just make my kids come here.

19:53.512 --> 19:56.715
I mean, they still, I mean, they bleed maroon.

19:56.955 --> 19:59.037
They didn't come to A&M, but they bleed maroon.

20:00.451 --> 20:01.873
Let's quit with that then.
