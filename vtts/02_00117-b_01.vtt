WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:22.123
It was held behind Duncan Hall.

00:29.782 --> 00:38.814
and see some of us that live there with the game on 
Thursday, one for either Austin or College

00:29.782 --> 00:38.814
Station. Those that live there, they go there on 
Friday and Saturday with our chainsaws with our

00:38.834 --> 00:49.188
sons to help us, and we would cut up what was left and 
take it home. But no, there would only be some

00:49.208 --> 00:51.912
little leftover log out at the side. They hadn't 
been part of the bonfire at all. And the campus

00:56.298 --> 00:59.282
folks were delighted that they didn't have to call 
everyone. and we'd go cut it and burn it up. Let's

01:03.759 --> 01:04.743
see. Describe Midnight Yell Frank.

01:55.068 --> 02:17.987
If you had a date,

01:55.068 --> 02:17.987
would the upper class then pick on you less? Your 
junior and

02:19.081 --> 02:25.986
senior year, your final year, was it in Texas?

03:26.969 --> 03:33.250
When

03:26.969 --> 03:33.250
you went through your theme, what did you think was 
the head of it?

05:01.840 --> 05:07.632
you

05:01.840 --> 05:07.632
and your buddies.

06:15.213 --> 06:33.559
But

06:15.213 --> 06:33.559
as

06:15.213 --> 06:33.559
a senior, did you and your buddy think about 
getting sent over there?

06:43.765 --> 06:47.410
Let me put an anecdote in here at this point. As dean 
of faculties, I took to Musgrave in 71 or 72. I've

06:53.699 --> 06:54.941
forgotten which. The provost from Columbia 
University had come to speak in what we called the

06:56.683 --> 07:01.490
Rudder Lectures. These were to honor President 
Rudder's memory. And he was going to give one of

07:05.816 --> 07:10.903
them at 8 o'clock April 21st. muster was then held, 
I think, at 6 or 6.30. And it was in G. Raleigh White

07:16.266 --> 07:18.988
Policy. And I said, sir, I'd like you to go with me to 
this because it will help you to understand this

07:19.008 --> 07:26.775
institution a bit more. And he said, oh, I've been 
to things like that before. After all, I've been to

07:30.038 --> 07:32.680
a lot of college campuses. I said, sir, I don't 
think you really have been to anything like an

07:32.700 --> 07:37.224
Aggie muster. It's rather distinctive. Well, as 
we got to, and I could tell he was was going but

07:41.883 --> 07:44.708
didn't want to go. He thought he was doing a favor. 
As we got to calling the muster roll of the Aggies

07:45.870 --> 08:04.060
that had died in the previous year, and 
particularly as we heard the number of young men

07:45.870 --> 08:04.060
who had graduated within the last three or four 
years who had obviously gotten killed in Vietnam,

08:04.546 --> 08:13.938
I mean, you heard the tone in some of their voices 
because for some I answered present in my heart

08:04.546 --> 08:13.938
because I'd had them in class. As we walked out, he 
turned to me and he said, I understand this now.

08:18.284 --> 08:19.446
You're correct. I haven't been to anything like 
that before. I do understand the movement a little

08:25.814 --> 08:27.176
bit. Let's see. Senior boots. How much did they 
cost? Do you need it?

08:37.537 --> 09:01.581
What

08:37.537 --> 09:01.581
other special Aggie memorabilia? Oh.

09:10.055 --> 09:26.005
What

09:10.055 --> 09:26.005
other important treasured Aggie memorabilia?

10:16.340 --> 10:18.874
All right, and the Aggie Ring. Aggie Ring, our word 
to this day.

10:46.968 --> 11:15.473
Do

10:46.968 --> 11:15.473
you have any Aggie Ring stories involving you of 
something that happened tied to the ring.

11:17.630 --> 11:21.486
Somebody somewhere saw it or you lost it and 
somebody found it. You already told me one. That's

11:22.992 --> 11:24.258
going to come a little longer. I've really been 
fooled.

12:30.766 --> 12:56.220
Yeah,

12:30.766 --> 12:56.220
I've

12:30.766 --> 12:56.220
never heard any put down. And like today, our 
son... who also went to A&M, he was saying how that

13:00.938 --> 13:12.078
all of this coverage of the tragedy of the bonfire 
is all done in a serious, positive note. Not any

13:12.098 --> 13:17.808
hint of what were these dumb people doing, why were 
they wasting news. There was nothing like that.

13:20.513 --> 13:24.600
Like, yes, most college graduates today don't 
wear a senior ring. I used to, and I don't hear a

13:25.441 --> 13:30.459
notice of anybody putting them down. I say that's 
very, very positive. Did you go to Muster when you

13:34.112 --> 13:36.480
were a student?

13:56.693 --> 14:04.541
A

13:56.693 --> 14:04.541
few muster was held for a while.

14:07.204 --> 14:11.629
Maybe your first one or two on the steps of the MSC. 
Then they moved it inside GRO. I know in the early

14:15.593 --> 14:22.880
70s, 72 or 73, by then it's moved into

14:15.593 --> 14:22.880
GRO. I'm sure I went to those. They don't stand out 
to me though.

15:05.172 --> 15:09.437
When I threw our son, I said, if y'all meet me this 
next year, I'd be delighted. It would be my 26th

15:09.457 --> 15:12.241
muster. That's a commencement. Describe 
commencement

15:15.164 --> 15:27.339
when

15:15.164 --> 15:27.339
you graduated. You know, I remember the final 
review. You win. I win? Oh, actually. Who came? No,

15:30.923 --> 15:32.725
no, from you. Oh, my family came after me.

15:47.326 --> 15:53.691
But

15:47.326 --> 15:53.691
I don't.

16:17.498 --> 16:18.160
Right. As you were preparing to leave the campus 
and following graduation, how well prepared did

16:18.180 --> 16:28.116
you think you were for the real world?

17:56.150 --> 18:04.340
Okay,

17:56.150 --> 18:04.340
we're getting near the end. Have we left out 
anything that you want to be sure

18:04.360 --> 18:16.475
to include? What creates a new spirit?

19:24.423 --> 19:44.892
What

19:24.423 --> 19:44.892
are the qualities of being an ape? What are the key 
ingredients of being an ape? What are the key

19:45.834 --> 19:46.735
ingredients of being an ape?

20:46.300 --> 20:56.910
What

20:46.300 --> 20:56.910
has it meant to you that you attended it? What 
difference did it make?

21:47.928 --> 22:05.864
Let's

21:47.928 --> 22:05.864
say this is the next part of your quest. If you have 
any idea of any ability that you're ever going to

22:05.884 --> 22:07.346
get rid of. Letters, autographs, I presume you 
didn't keep a diary or a journal or anything. If you

22:08.990 --> 22:10.172
ever have any of that or come across anything, This

22:10.827 --> 22:31.470
becomes

22:10.827 --> 22:31.470
the safe place

22:10.827 --> 22:31.470
for those to be kept. Most of us, modern days, we 
don't keep those things, but a few people did.

22:36.275 --> 22:38.117
Okay, then next to last, If someone came in to

22:38.198 --> 23:01.320
you and gave you a million-dollar check with only 
one restriction, that it must be passed on to Texas

22:38.198 --> 23:01.320
A&M, if you can decide what use A&M would make of it, 
what

22:38.198 --> 23:01.320
would you want them to do? In other words, what I'm 
really asking you, what are the dearest parts of

23:01.340 --> 23:04.003
A&M to you?

24:06.235 --> 24:07.117
what feelings we get.
