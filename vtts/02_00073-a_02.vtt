03:54.526 --> 04:07.281
There

03:54.526 --> 04:07.281
were five states that they were the regional 
veterinary school for. I think it was five,

04:07.882 --> 04:14.730
Mississippi, Alabama, actually Mississippi, 
Tennessee, Kentucky, and Florida.

04:21.899 --> 04:22.660
Particularly. Thank you.

05:12.556 --> 05:15.521
We had a strange class. They were older. Nearly all 
of them had been in World War II. They had been in

05:22.673 --> 05:27.862
military service. All of them except one were 4F

05:28.824 --> 05:36.437
people that couldn't qualify.

05:52.988 --> 05:59.658
That's all, the locker room conversation and 
everything was where they were going to go to

05:52.988 --> 05:59.658
practice and how much money they were going to 
make. This is at Iowa State. What about the Aggies

06:01.101 --> 06:12.498
here, their work habits, their

06:01.101 --> 06:12.498
liberal or conservative attitudes, their 
background? Even at first class, that first class

06:13.680 --> 06:21.392
that I taught in 1960, full class I taught in 1966, 
Probably there's at least 20 or 25 out of that class

06:22.570 --> 06:33.664
that have made tremendous

06:22.570 --> 06:33.664
marks in veterinary medicine. And there were at 
least a half a dozen or more in the class that

06:34.285 --> 06:41.835
graduated in August of 1965 who did equally as 
well. There are really some great students in

06:42.536 --> 06:46.401
there. The problem they had then was exercising 
it. They got out just at the right time when

06:50.626 --> 06:59.398
veterinary medicine began to blossom into the 
great science that it is. Instead of being animal

06:59.458 --> 07:02.662
treaters, they became scientists. And many of 
them have really made tremendous achievements in

07:03.503 --> 07:09.430
it. Dewey Kramer. for example, here at Texas A&M, 
was in the first class I taught in 1966. He got his

07:18.244 --> 07:25.435
PhD in December of 1965 and his Doctor of 
Veterinary Medicine in August of 66. And he is, of

07:26.857 --> 07:35.049
course, he was the first one to do an embryo 
transplant at the research station in San

07:26.857 --> 07:35.049
Antonio. And several others in that class, Gerald 
Bratton, Dean Gage, James Anderson. It just goes

07:42.041 --> 07:44.785
on and on and on. Men who really made tremendous 
marks in the veterinary profession.

07:53.977 --> 07:59.665
It's

07:53.977 --> 07:59.665
just gotten better every year. In 1972,

08:04.293 --> 08:12.850
The American Veterinary Medical Association 
employed an outfit in Chicago to do a study on the

08:04.293 --> 08:12.850
profession of veterinary medicine. And they paid 
them a rather tidy sum for doing it. And they came up

08:17.158 --> 08:23.010
with the dramatic and marvelous conclusion that 
by 1985, we would be super-saturated with

08:17.158 --> 08:23.010
veterinarians. And this really had a telling 
impact on, particularly on those schools who were

08:23.665 --> 08:33.004
pumping legislators for money. They got this 
little report that says you're going to have too

08:34.406 --> 08:38.755
many of them in 1985, as it is. Well, it turned out 
they were 100% wrong. And I said at the time, I don't

08:41.962 --> 08:56.081
understand your thinking when here are a group of 
graduates who represent the upper probably 10% of

08:41.962 --> 08:56.081
the academic community as far as academic ability 
is concerned. And you're telling me that these

08:56.882 --> 09:03.171
people are going to remain unemployed while 
people of lesser quality are going to be employed?

09:05.314 --> 09:06.936
Let's kid ourselves. And they've proven it by 
branching out into so many different directions

09:07.287 --> 09:17.799
in the medical profession and are able to hold 
their own and have held their own. In some of the

09:18.400 --> 09:31.375
early days of DeBakey's transplant work in 
Houston, a guy named, I can't think of his last

09:18.400 --> 09:31.375
name, he's still on the faculty at Tufts, did all 
the work. He was an Ohio State graduate that So

09:34.675 --> 09:53.713
they've really made such a tremendous 
contribution and we're still struggling because

09:34.675 --> 09:53.713
the pharmaceutical profession or the 
pharmaceutical industry and the medical

09:34.675 --> 09:53.713
profession too can't afford yet the studies that 
need to be done on the so-called exotic animals.

09:59.837 --> 10:00.858
The money isn't there. And yet in these animals are 
things that we really need to know and would like to

10:01.619 --> 10:12.909
know if we could get the funds and the research 
facilities to study them. The San Diego Zoo has

10:12.929 --> 10:20.676
done a lot, but they haven't had the opportunity to 
do it near enough. Before you got here, what had you

10:22.027 --> 10:25.512
heard about Aggies and Texas A&M? Based on what you 
had heard, what were you anticipating?

10:33.402 --> 10:47.681
The only preface I had to coming here was two weeks 
at a poultry inspection school in Kansas City,

10:33.402 --> 10:47.681
Missouri, in January of 1958. There were two 
Aggies. that were there that day. And I learned a

10:52.617 --> 11:00.066
great deal about the people they didn't like in the 
veterinary faculty here, and little else. And the

11:01.368 --> 11:20.333
only thing else I knew about Texas A&M when I came 
here in the summer of 65 was,

11:01.368 --> 11:20.333
I can't think of his last name, the high jumper that 
got the bronze medal in 52. And

11:20.684 --> 11:31.300
Randy Mattson and John Kimbrough. The disaster in 
the Texas game in 63, which I was watching on

11:33.143 --> 11:38.811
television that day. But other than that, I 
didn't... Had you heard about Aggie tradition?

11:44.915 --> 11:48.398
No, no, I knew nothing of it, absolutely nothing. 
What academic reputation did you think A&M had

11:48.458 --> 11:57.406
before you

11:48.458 --> 11:57.406
got here? I had very, very limited contact with 
that. We had a man came on our faculty at Iowa State

12:02.471 --> 12:07.515
in the fall of 1948. named William Schweitzer, who 
graduated here in the spring of 48. He was a

12:13.585 --> 12:15.267
classmate of George Shelton's. He came up to the 
diagnostics laboratory, and he stayed the rest of

12:17.290 --> 12:20.595
his career. He just retired. When did he retire, 
Kim? About a year ago, two years ago? Stayed the

12:25.642 --> 12:27.585
rest of his career there. And I don't know. Any 
other man from Texas that came up there, and Bill

12:33.078 --> 12:43.134
Monlux, who was an Iowa State graduate, who was the 
one who sent me down here, came there after I

12:33.078 --> 12:43.134
graduated. And his brother, Andrew Monlux, was on 
the microbiology faculty when I was a student. And

12:48.944 --> 12:52.389
he eventually became the head of the Department of 
Pathology at Oklahoma A&M. But they were Iowans.

12:53.211 --> 12:56.436
They were born and raised in Algona, Iowa. But 
Monlux taught here for several years after World

12:56.456 --> 13:00.182
War II. describe getting settled into the 
community and how you and your family became a part

13:00.635 --> 13:10.703
of the community?

13:10.864 --> 13:12.689
Where did you find a place to live? We bought a house 
that just had been finished on Glade Street. There

13:19.509 --> 13:21.132
were three houses in a row over there. And this was 
the last one that was empty. And it was a four

13:23.336 --> 13:25.500
bedroom house and with four children. That's what 
we needed. It was open and available. And to avoid

13:28.264 --> 13:30.809
moving twice or more, we took it. Paid $20,000 for 
it. And I lived there until 1982.

13:41.911 --> 13:50.123
As far as getting into the community is concerned, 
it was just easy. Children in school?

13:56.032 --> 13:57.073
Yes. Susan was a freshman in high school. She was in 
a band and played in athletics. Sarah was in second

14:05.185 --> 14:06.687
grade. Yeah, it was in second grade. The other two 
hadn't started school yet. In the two that were in

14:12.075 --> 14:25.516
school, did you have the impression that the local 
school system was better than or equal to or less

14:12.075 --> 14:25.516
than what you had experienced elsewhere? It was 
better than what we had at Auburn, much. What about

14:30.623 --> 14:31.645
shopping?

14:36.468 --> 14:38.530
The only place you went to shop was Townshire. That 
was it. You didn't shop in College Station for

14:40.452 --> 14:42.274
anything. But we didn't go out of town to shop 
either. We never went out of town. Anything we

14:48.000 --> 14:55.047
needed we got either at Sears or

14:48.000 --> 14:55.047
I can't remember all the different places in 
Townshire. And downtown Bryan, we did a lot of

14:55.087 --> 14:58.450
shopping in downtown Bryan. That's where we did 
most of it. Did you join a church? Yes, we went to

15:01.233 --> 15:04.136
church at the Methodist Church. We moved in here on 
a Wednesday, I think it was that we went to church on

15:07.079 --> 15:10.384
Sunday, and we've been going there ever since. A&M 
Methodist. A&M Methodist. In fact, there are only

15:14.770 --> 15:22.801
probably three or four people going to church 
there now that have been there as long as I have. Ed

15:24.684 --> 15:31.193
Holdridge was there, and Fred Benson's wife, and 
E.J. Dykstra Heiss's wife, and that's about it.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.301
This is not part of the interview. Is Mrs. Benson 
still living? Oh, yes. We see her every Sunday. Is

15:41.044 --> 15:43.066
she still living? I would say she's taking a real 
like to Kim. Kim makes a point of seeing her. Would

15:49.053 --> 15:51.676
she be in? Oh, yes. And she'd be thrilled to death. 
She's a delightful lady. She's a lovely lady.

16:04.201 --> 16:06.586
that church in those days. I'm sure parking wasn't 
a problem. I

16:08.731 --> 16:14.783
don't know. We just had one service.

16:34.492 --> 16:41.859
But two years after I got here, they got into a bit of 
a ministerial struggle. And that

16:43.400 --> 16:47.504
went on until 1970. Then in 1971,

16:47.524 --> 17:03.418
James Branagh

16:47.524 --> 17:03.418
It has really . church

17:04.546 --> 17:11.156
that it served the campus? That was its intent.

17:16.925 --> 17:20.550
But then the other churches in the area were there 
too. The A&M Presbyterian was A&M but the Lutheran

17:20.610 --> 17:30.545
church they didn't use the same proximity. In 
terms of Who they were? No, no. Just about

17:37.428 --> 17:40.939
everybody in the congregation was associated 
with the university. Most business people in the

17:41.983 --> 17:45.815
community went to Bryan. They were members of 
First Methodist Church.

20:19.469 --> 20:28.327
The only time I've ever been to a midnight yell 
practice was at a bowl game somewhere, and I can't

20:19.469 --> 20:28.327
remember where. Oh, it was in Memphis. First time 
we played at the Liberty Bowl in Memphis. That's

20:33.458 --> 20:35.522
the only midnight yell practice I've ever been to. 
Have you been to the Silver Taps? No, I haven't. She

20:39.090 --> 20:40.212
has, but I haven't. That first fall, you must have 
gone to a football game. Yes, went to every one of

20:43.946 --> 20:45.608
them. What was the impression of an Aggie football 
game in those first years? Of course, the fall of 65

20:49.373 --> 20:51.857
was a tough fall. But I enjoyed the games. I thought 
that Gene Stallings really got everything he had

20:56.383 --> 21:04.094
out of those guys. And of course, the game with 
Texas Thanksgiving Day in 65 was probably...

21:10.330 --> 21:13.954
Maybe as exciting a game as we've ever had in the 
series, really. That was the day of the famous

21:14.895 --> 21:18.559
lateral pass and the long pass to McLean. And they 
were down 17 to nothing at the half, and then came

21:18.659 --> 21:24.466
back and beat us 21 to 17 in the second half. But it 
was fun. And then, of course, basketball. 1966 was

21:33.938 --> 21:37.223
extremely exciting. John Beasley and Mattson,

21:37.264 --> 21:45.377
they made the games fun. Probably of all the 
basketball games that I've seen here, the game

21:45.838 --> 21:53.230
with Houston that fall When they had Chaney and, 
oh, the big guy who played for years in the pros, was

21:53.750 --> 22:01.365
a center. He was a sophomore that year. I can't 
think of his name now. But A&M, I think, beat them 96

22:05.192 --> 22:09.320
to 93 or something like that. And that was just 
really exciting as any basketball game you could

22:09.580 --> 22:16.213
ever see. Now, when did you get involved outside of 
the department in some of the campus activities?

22:26.772 --> 22:28.494
I'll call them. Well,

22:28.514 --> 22:35.080
I'm trying to remember which came first.

22:39.024 --> 22:45.390
Probably in the summer of 1968, Buck Wirus asked me 
to go to beaumont and speak to the beaumont a m club

22:47.480 --> 23:14.787
how did how did he know to call you well of course 
buck went to method church and uh i

22:47.480 --> 23:14.787
don't know i don't really know how that how the 
tie-in came but anyway i

22:47.480 --> 23:14.787
and i remember buck telling me on the way down he 
says no I don't care what you say or how you say it,

23:15.374 --> 23:27.588
but... And it'll go. And I did. And about that same 
time was when I got involved in commencement. In

23:35.658 --> 23:39.002
the summer of 1968...

25:23.945 --> 25:24.271
Thank you.

28:13.792 --> 28:36.154
What's

28:13.792 --> 28:36.154
up?

30:50.054 --> 30:55.446
How many hours of preparation a spring 
commencement might have taken?

31:01.279 --> 31:02.462
Upwards of fifty at least. Did you literally say 
them out loud somewhere, practice them? I read

31:09.612 --> 31:10.715
them silently. I never did them out loud. I read 
them silently. But when we'd be on the stage at the

31:13.241 --> 31:22.343
commencement exercises, I would go through the 
list at least twice before I got up to read. Any

31:23.305 --> 31:27.756
horror stories of losing the list?
