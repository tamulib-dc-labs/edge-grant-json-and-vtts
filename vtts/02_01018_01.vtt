00:02.191 --> 00:10.082
Interview with Dr. W. W. Rostow, aide to 
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, May 2, 1986, LBJ

00:02.191 --> 00:10.082
Library. Testing, one, two, three.

00:26.303 --> 00:31.270
Actually, having this close is pretty, it would be 
really close from the room. All

00:31.705 --> 00:47.783
right. In U.S. News and World Report, you stated 
that Hanoi built its policy on the judgment that

00:47.803 --> 00:56.413
the U.S. could not stand a long, indecisive war. 
and that Washington built its policy on faith in

00:56.917 --> 01:02.245
the reality of South Vietnamese and Southeast 
Asian nationalism. And I'm curious what faith

01:02.805 --> 01:07.392
you're speaking of, and I would like this sort of in 
two parts. In 1961, when President Kennedy

01:08.093 --> 01:15.864
increased the number of advisors, and then in 
1965, when we committed ground forces. What's

01:17.506 --> 01:19.229
your question? You speak that we built our policy 
on the faith in the reality of South Vietnamese and

01:19.589 --> 01:25.878
Southeast Asian nationalism. That's correct. 
And I'm curious what nationalism you speak of. I'm

01:30.440 --> 01:36.487
talking about the nationalism of the South 
Vietnamese, who wanted a destiny independent of

01:30.440 --> 01:36.487
Hanoi. That was the central question that 
President Kennedy asked me to investigate, as I

01:37.048 --> 01:47.360
reported, when I went out with General Taylor. And

01:47.380 --> 01:55.189
before he made up his mind, he committed himself to 
the defense of South Vietnam under the Southeast

01:56.182 --> 02:02.427
Asian Treaty. He explored all the evidence he 
could that the South Vietnamese did not wish to go

02:02.447 --> 02:07.832
with the North. And as I say, that was the central 
question he asked me, aside from being number two

02:09.574 --> 02:18.061
in that mission, to investigate. And I describe 
how I did it in the Diffusion of Power, and I

02:18.101 --> 02:21.104
recorded it here. But he based his his policy on the 
answer, as indeed did President Johnson. And

02:31.864 --> 02:37.611
there's no doubt that there was, and is to this day, 
a very strong South Vietnamese nationalism.

02:38.592 --> 02:45.159
These people did not wish to go under the North, and 
they still haven't accepted rule from the North.

02:45.759 --> 02:49.303
The North has been ruling the South through a 
carpetbagger administration. There's a

02:50.484 --> 02:51.385
convention. The conventional wisdom in a number 
of writers is that nationalism was on the side of

02:51.445 --> 02:56.631
the and that there was no South Vietnamese 
nationalism. That's just not true. I know there's

03:01.973 --> 03:12.487
a difference because we've discussed the Chinese 
influence and the Indian influence on the South

03:01.973 --> 03:12.487
and the Chinese influence on the North and how 
there's really two different people almost.

03:12.507 --> 03:15.831
Well, it's three different people, and that's one 
of the great illusions. They have the same

03:15.871 --> 03:19.215
language, but there's a delta. There's central 
Vietnam from which both Ho Chi Minh and Jim came,

03:20.737 --> 03:27.546
and then there's the Red River Valley people. And 
they have, they never, you know, had a really truly

03:28.268 --> 03:38.603
united existence, and they have very distinct 
regionalized. And the history of the whole

03:39.024 --> 03:53.044
post-colonial period has tragically, instead of 
bringing them together,

03:39.024 --> 03:53.044
heightened those tensions which are deep in their 
history. Well, I have another question with that.

03:55.595 --> 04:02.544
When I think of nationalism, I think of unity of a 
people that are willing to work towards a goal. And

04:03.425 --> 04:10.293
in South Vietnam, you find a people that are, you 
know, you have a Catholic leader at first, leading

04:03.425 --> 04:10.293
Buddhists. And as you reported in your book, in 
fact, in your report, the Rostow-Taylor report,

04:11.254 --> 04:21.546
you said that some of the people really just didn't 
care who ruled them, they just wanted to be left

04:21.948 --> 04:26.993
alone and grow their rice. Well, the point about it 
is you've got to understand what a little

04:27.573 --> 04:34.259
post-colonial country is. They wanted to—in most 
developing countries, which have not had a long

04:35.420 --> 04:51.735
history of national experience, you will find 
that the ties of clan, tribe in Africa, of region

04:52.542 --> 04:56.707
are much stronger than the ties of nation, which 
are rather abstract. What bound these people

04:58.890 --> 05:05.958
right to the end, and right down to the present 
time, is they did not wish to be run by the North. And

05:08.020 --> 05:20.355
they also

05:08.020 --> 05:20.355
were united in an extraordinary way

05:08.020 --> 05:20.355
for country at that stage in its history in a desire 
to be independent of the North politically, and

05:21.550 --> 05:30.418
they fought. It used to shock students when I used 
to sit and talk with them about this, and it'll

05:32.660 --> 05:44.872
shock you no doubt, but they were much more united 
in their struggle against the North than we were

05:32.660 --> 05:44.872
against the British in the War of Independence. 
Maybe one-third of the Americans were for

05:45.773 --> 05:50.157
independence, one-third were pro-British, The 
third were out to make a fast buck selling stuff to

05:50.592 --> 05:54.497
the Army or out to lunch. These people, when they 
went into the Army, there was no one-year hitch.

06:02.247 --> 06:04.890
They'd be carried out in a plastic bag or wounded. 
And at the time of Tet, if you passed out a million

06:04.910 --> 06:12.720
guns, he knew which way they were going to shoot. He 
wasn't worried. That was not the problem. Well, if

06:15.183 --> 06:19.148
I could play devil's advocate here for a second. 
Battle of Atpak in January 1963. The Arvin clearly

06:21.823 --> 06:29.755
outnumbered the VC, and yet they threw their guns 
down and they ran. There were occasions when they

06:29.775 --> 06:37.166
were outflanked or they ran, but on the whole they 
were very uneven. They were a much more advanced

06:38.428 --> 06:42.595
army— Than we give them credit for? —than the 
Koreans were at the equivalent period. We

06:45.706 --> 06:47.389
couldn't do what we did in Korea. It might have been 
in some way better, but they were much better

06:47.409 --> 06:53.238
organized and much more competent. They had, we 
just integrated the units. And some Korea, it was

06:57.825 --> 07:03.253
very good for the Korean training, but it was not 
good for institutionally.

07:05.317 --> 07:12.608
These people had their separate units, and there 
was a wide range of competence in those units.

07:13.533 --> 07:22.202
I remember when General Abrams came back after 
Tet, he went through all the major units and, you

07:13.533 --> 07:22.202
know, gave them, like a professor, he gave them the 
grades. And there was a considerable range. And,

07:24.544 --> 07:32.412
you know, they had some units who, the first 
division, I think, was one of the, it was as good as

07:24.544 --> 07:32.412
any American division. Others were mediocre. And 
the quality of the leadership, but you see, you've

07:34.634 --> 07:39.940
got to understand what a little post-colonial 
country's like. It takes time. I mean, your

07:44.026 --> 07:49.792
question, you see, revealed that you hadn't given 
enough thought. My notion of nationalism is they

07:49.853 --> 07:51.835
want a country. I mean, they're all united around a 
common purpose. Well, they weren't. They had much

07:55.118 --> 07:59.503
more unity, as I say, than we did at an equivalent 
time in our history. But they had all sorts of

08:00.745 --> 08:03.488
divisions. And the one thing that overwhelmingly 
united them was that they didn't want to be run from

08:03.768 --> 08:09.274
the North. But it went on. I'll tell you one. You 
want to go back, if you're interested in learning

08:14.496 --> 08:20.822
about this and not simply repeating cliches and 
being devil's advocate. Study sometime the

08:21.463 --> 08:23.164
elections of 1967.

08:25.927 --> 08:29.991
And a very good team was sent out by the president 
and the press. And these people, I was there when

08:31.052 --> 08:38.600
they reported, and they were all people with an 
independent constituency. That is to say, they

08:38.620 --> 08:40.982
were not beholden to the president at all. A number 
of them were against his policy.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.882
whatever.

08:50.744 --> 08:55.028
But they threw themselves very seriously into 
that election, very moving. So they were moving

08:56.089 --> 09:14.665
forward, and if we hadn't walked out on them, 
they'd be well on their way to being—they have the

08:56.089 --> 09:14.665
basic vitality of the South Koreans, and they 
would have made an economic and social success in

08:56.089 --> 09:14.665
the place.

09:21.091 --> 09:22.132
Okay.

09:24.295 --> 09:27.200
Was Ho Chi Minh a communist or a nationalist, in 
your opinion? He was proud to be a communist, very

09:28.261 --> 09:32.167
proud to be a communist. He was in the Comintern 
apparatus since the First World War, and he was the

09:32.187 --> 09:40.598
first to tell you he's a communist. Of course he's a 
communist. That doesn't mean he wasn't a

09:43.442 --> 09:46.086
nationalist also, to some extent. But he was part 
of the—they all have strands of nationalism in

09:46.893 --> 09:52.941
them. But yes, he was a professional who rose up to 
be head of the Vietnamese Communist Party by

09:53.883 --> 10:02.435
knocking off some of his opposition members. But, 
you know, there's no question he worked in Moscow.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.044
He was in the commentary and all the rest of it. 
Okay. Could we have recognized him in 1945,

10:09.184 --> 10:15.533
though, when he declared independence? He had a 
constitution based after ours. He offered us the

10:18.869 --> 10:23.835
use of Cameron Bay to put an American military base 
in. Who said that? That was in the Pentagon Papers,

10:26.458 --> 10:28.340
I believe. I don't remember ever reading that, and 
I don't believe he would do that. He couldn't do

10:33.727 --> 10:38.833
that and maintain his relations with China and 
Russia. He might have done it during the war,

10:40.135 --> 10:43.159
perhaps, or something like that. But the point 
about it is, he was a thoroughly professional

10:45.668 --> 11:13.144
communist and his pattern of action is just like 
the communists in Nicaragua or Cuba or China what

10:45.668 --> 11:13.144
was the pattern to organize a popular front and 
with all kinds of people to tell the peasants you

10:45.668 --> 11:13.144
want to get your land to work with the Catholic 
Church in opposition with the unions until he had

10:45.668 --> 11:13.144
power Then, with the hardcore communists, he 
cleaned out the unions. He cleaned out the church.

11:20.416 --> 11:22.539
He didn't give the people a land. He put them in 
collective farms. Very pedestrian exercise in

11:24.901 --> 11:30.047
the takeover of power, right by the book. And you do 
know, by this time, if you don't see it, I don't know

11:31.088 --> 11:35.493
when you're ever going to learn about it. But this 
is what's been repeated over and over again. Now,

11:38.817 --> 11:44.143
the question is, if China had decided that it was 
not going into

11:47.482 --> 11:50.545
with the Soviet Union. He might have tried to make, 
I think, separate terms with the United States,

11:50.565 --> 12:08.661
but China decided, for very good reasons, from a 
communist point of view, that they would be

11:50.565 --> 12:08.661
dishonest,

11:50.565 --> 12:08.661
faithless to their own duty to history. Why? 
Because it's written into communist doctrine out

12:10.883 --> 12:15.447
of the experience of the Soviets. Communist Party 
came to power as a counter-revolution in the midst

12:16.692 --> 12:22.700
of the confusions of war. The confusions and 
flexibility, if you like, revolutionary

12:23.641 --> 12:39.462
potential of a war

12:23.641 --> 12:39.462
is written into the training of every good 
communist as a time of opportunity. And when Mao

12:41.404 --> 12:44.488
looked at the situation in Asia, what did he see? He 
saw a very weak South Korea and America that had

12:46.409 --> 12:53.099
pulled its forces out. He looked at Taiwan, a 
defeated dynasty as in the past, Chinese history,

12:53.119 --> 13:09.201
had gone to Formosa and was having very grave 
trouble with the people on Formosa. It was

13:09.221 --> 13:10.163
palpable. There was a guerrilla set up in the 
Philippines operating communists.

13:17.240 --> 13:46.538
there was a communist party and there was fighting 
in Malaysia in Burma also it turned out in

13:17.240 --> 13:46.538
Indonesia and the Japanese occupation had 
destroyed the foundations for colonialism in

13:17.240 --> 13:46.538
Asia any good communist would say this is a great 
historical opportunity to move forward now if we

13:17.240 --> 13:46.538
tie up with the Americans we have to we can't go into 
conduct guerrilla wars all over Asia because

13:47.598 --> 13:53.468
these are strategically going to be at the expense 
of the Americans.

13:56.133 --> 14:10.519
And therefore, it's proper for us to join the one 
major country that shares our interest in the

13:56.133 --> 14:10.519
success of making the most of this period of 
dishevelment in Asia for our purposes. And that's

14:11.180 --> 14:11.901
what happened. They debated it in China, but they 
decided to lean to one side, even though Mao's

14:12.370 --> 14:20.938
relations with Stalin had been, and with Moscow 
generally, had been very poor. But at a time like

14:22.639 --> 14:29.205
that, his overriding duty was to make the most of 
this post-war period, and they tried. And they had

14:29.225 --> 14:40.335
guerrilla wars operating not only in Indochina, 
but the Philippines, Burma,

14:46.205 --> 14:50.591
From their point of view, I find it wholly 
understandable.

14:55.338 --> 14:58.802
Who controlled the fighting of the war, LBJ or the 
military?

15:02.808 --> 15:04.751
You really haven't read much, have you? Yes, sir, I 
have. What answer did you get from your reading? I

15:09.437 --> 15:11.019
would say that LBJ did. In what sense? Well, he 
picked all the spots for the bombing. We've had

15:14.955 --> 15:22.443
pilots come into our, veterans come into our class 
and give lectures. And there's one, in fact, said

15:22.803 --> 15:37.457
that if you went on a bombing mission, but along the 
way you saw a VC battalion or something like that,

15:22.803 --> 15:37.457
you couldn't stop and immediately go to that 
fighting. You had to call back and then that person

15:41.200 --> 15:43.582
would have to call back, and so on and so forth. And 
then we've also discussed how there was no supreme

15:44.163 --> 15:51.249
commander in Vietnam, that Arvin had their own 
commanders. We had our own commander, General

15:51.309 --> 15:57.595
Westmoreland, and he was under the admiral in 
Hawaii, who was under President Johnson. No, he

15:58.075 --> 15:59.497
was under the Joint Chiefs. No, the point about it 
is it's quite right that President Johnson had

15:59.517 --> 16:05.602
made a number of very fundamental decisions. The 
first was that which I disagreed, but his decision

16:09.179 --> 16:19.069
was that we would fight the war basically on the 
ground inside the boundary of Vietnam. That is to

16:19.089 --> 16:24.554
say, we wouldn't go into the Laos corridors on the 
ground where I wanted to go, for example. Or we

16:24.574 --> 16:26.837
wouldn't go into North Vietnam on the ground. 
Secondly, he controlled, and that's general

16:28.719 --> 16:35.385
strategy in the war, he did control. Two, he 
controlled the targets around Hanoi. which were

16:39.740 --> 16:45.846
settled at the Tuesday lunch, and what he had was a 
set of questions. The question was, one, what is

16:48.168 --> 16:52.813
the target and its military meaning? What 
advantages do you get from hitting the target?

16:56.297 --> 16:58.579
Two, how many men would we lose and how many plans? 
Three, what would be likely civilian casualties?

17:05.966 --> 17:09.510
Four, what are the possibilities of hitting a 
foreign ship or something? And he would, the

17:11.060 --> 17:16.428
target list around Hanoi would come to him. He did 
not interfere for good or ill. He did not interfere

17:20.855 --> 17:28.727
with the use of air power inside Vietnam or in the 
Panhandle or in the Laos Carriers.

17:33.975 --> 17:39.143
But the broad strategy of how the war would be 
fought and where it would be fought, the orders of

17:41.215 --> 17:51.629
magnitude of men that we would put in there, and the 
equipment, and the targets around Hanoi. These he

17:51.649 --> 17:54.493
kept under personal control. Otherwise, I'd say 
Westmoreland really had a quite free hand within

17:54.513 --> 18:00.200
that broad strategy. But the real operative 
center for military decision, except for those

18:00.621 --> 18:09.012
three exceptions, was the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Did you agree with search and destroy? Did you

18:12.415 --> 18:14.677
think that was the way to use our ground forces in 
Vietnam? That wasn't the only way we did use our

18:14.717 --> 18:17.219
ground forces. The ground forces were much more 
complex. See, this was a three-level war. It was a

18:24.285 --> 18:31.652
general, it was a war of conventional forces 
without a fixed front against the North

18:24.285 --> 18:31.652
Vietnamese.

18:31.672 --> 18:35.035
It was a war against the main force, VC units. It was 
a quite different kind of war. And then there were

18:38.725 --> 18:46.333
the, the, the, what you call authentic guerrilla 
operations, which are quite different now. And

18:47.174 --> 18:53.281
the proportions of those three elements changed 
through time.

18:53.301 --> 19:01.430
And

18:53.301 --> 19:01.430
it ended up being with the VC washed out after Tet. 
Main force units, very weak. And it was mainly a

19:05.655 --> 19:07.737
North, and by the big battle of 72. It was a, a North 
Vietnamese war against the, without a fixed

19:09.158 --> 19:16.948
front, conventional war. 61, I'd say it was 
overwhelmingly a guerrilla war. And so you've got

19:21.092 --> 19:31.184
to track all three elements into it, and search and 
destroy is a, it's, it's a very, let me give you an

19:21.092 --> 19:31.184
example, different kinds of operations.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.572
When we began to get some forces on the ground,

19:40.319 --> 19:47.888
we went into some base areas where we'd never been 
before, which we didn't have the power to

19:40.319 --> 19:47.888
penetrate in an effective way. We began to do that 
in 66, 67. And

19:51.612 --> 20:05.829
what you would do is to go in there and engage the 
forces and go to the bases and try to capture

19:51.612 --> 20:05.829
documents and do all that kind of thing. That's one 
kind of operation. Another kind of operation It

20:11.656 --> 20:14.699
would be quite different. It would be when

20:14.799 --> 20:24.530
the North Vietnamese came across the border near 
Cambodia, for example. Those are big units, and

20:24.550 --> 20:35.603
you knew that they might come to Dalat, or they 
might come to An Loc, or they might come to any

20:24.550 --> 20:35.603
number of places along there, Loc Ninh. And you 
would preempt them. You'd get helicopters and

20:38.335 --> 20:45.767
you'd go in and engage them and rough them up enough 
so that they'd have to go back and re-equip and wait

20:38.335 --> 20:45.767
for new men or something. That would be a 
preemptive operation.

20:50.234 --> 20:57.906
Under what's called search and destroy, there's a 
very wide range of different kind of operations.

20:57.966 --> 21:05.338
My basic view and difference of policy was that I 
felt that fighting the war from the inside was

21:06.230 --> 21:19.266
going to be very slow and costly for the people of 
Southeast Asia, our lives, for ourselves,

21:06.230 --> 21:19.266
American people, the world. That the war depended 
upon the flow of men and supplies from North

21:20.707 --> 21:27.596
Vietnam. The air power could impose a tax on that 
flow, but not interdicted. But it could be

21:32.822 --> 21:35.545
interdicted on the ground. two beefed-up U.S. 
divisions with plenty of air support. And that's

21:40.355 --> 21:41.396
what I wanted to do.

21:44.279 --> 21:59.954
You discussed that the air attacks diverted 
83,000 MVA troops and how it afflicted attrition

21:44.279 --> 21:59.954
and all this, and yet the North Vietnamese and the 
VC matched every one of our troop increases, and

21:44.279 --> 21:59.954
they just kept coming. They kept the pressure upon 
us. So in hindsight, do you believe the bombing was

22:02.016 --> 22:05.700
effective as you first believed? Well, I did never 
believe that the bombing itself was going to be

22:06.946 --> 22:10.410
decisive. That's why I just told you something. 
You didn't seem to take it in. I said what I wanted to

22:15.515 --> 22:36.919
do was to put forces on the ground because the flow 
of supplies and the problem of handling those

22:15.515 --> 22:36.919
supplies

22:15.515 --> 22:36.919
was something

22:15.515 --> 22:36.919
where air power could impose attacks, but it 
couldn't stop them. Now, you got that? Yes, sir.

22:38.723 --> 22:40.445
All right. And, uh, I thought it was, you know, not 
sufficient. And, uh, uh, the,

22:43.288 --> 23:05.235
uh, so that I, that's why I did not think that air 
power could be used decisively and that, but that

22:43.288 --> 23:05.235
ground forces could be used decisively by going 
into Laos on the ground and, and interacting with

22:43.288 --> 23:05.235
Ho Chi Minh trails, which is not one trail, it's an 
area. and I thought that could be done and should

23:06.532 --> 23:08.515
have been done.

23:11.819 --> 23:15.224
Besides, I had other disagreements with the way 
air power was used. I thought it was used very well

23:15.264 --> 23:21.012
at—what's

23:15.264 --> 23:21.012
that base? Denae? No, no, no, during Tet 
Offensive, that place up near the border. What's

23:27.280 --> 23:28.662
the name of the very famous place? Quezon? Quezon. 
It was used very well under General Mollmeyer. We

23:33.649 --> 23:34.530
began to have I really worked out in that period the 
first really good use, I mean effective use, of the

23:34.898 --> 23:48.982
tactical air in the Laos corridors in southern 
North Vietnam. But it was very hard to do because

23:49.002 --> 23:53.771
the flow of supplies was limited. So I don't think 
air power was used maximally, but a maximum use of

23:58.861 --> 24:07.132
it couldn't have been decisive, in my judgment, 
had it acted on the ground. But your other

24:07.673 --> 24:12.480
assumption is they didn't—it wasn't a question of 
their matching. What they did in North Vietnam was

24:12.520 --> 24:26.539
to—what they saw was the gradual attenuation, 66, 
67, 68, 69, of the South Vietnamese forces And they

24:27.380 --> 24:36.833
put in in 72 a truly maximum effort at that time, 
after we had withdrawn our ground forces. And they

24:37.615 --> 24:42.962
were beaten, a fact which no one ever seems to 
mention anymore. And that's how we got the truth.

24:45.686 --> 24:49.792
And I think without Watergate, they were lived by 
that truth. Did you read the account of the

24:49.912 --> 24:56.121
victorious North Vietnamese general in 75, of why 
they went in in 75? Yes, sir, I was going to ask you

24:56.962 --> 24:58.344
that. Well, you fellas don't do any homework. You 
just come up with the same old cliches that all the

25:02.090 --> 25:10.104
kids had in the 60s, and you really ought to learn 
more. You're not in the 60s. You're a new

25:11.446 --> 25:13.069
generation. I'm sorry, I read that in your, how you 
were irritated by certain questions being asked.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.459
I'm not irritated by them. I'm just—no, but, you 
know, I don't—I spent more time with students, but

25:19.675 --> 25:35.556
I'm just—what makes me sad, generally going 
around the country, when I talk to students, they

25:19.675 --> 25:35.556
don't come up with the same old—they want to know 
what happened.

25:38.941 --> 25:47.252
And I spent, you know, these talks with students, 
never less than three, usually five or six Here is

25:48.768 --> 25:59.882
the document you ought to get, our great spring 
victory in account of the liberation of South

25:48.768 --> 25:59.882
Vietnam by General Van Tien Dung, chief of staff of 
the Vietnam People's Army. This is his account of

26:01.023 --> 26:05.729
the circumstances that led him to go in. It's 
summarized in the New York Times of April 26, 1976.

26:12.597 --> 26:17.323
And all I'm going to do now is—but he gives a very 
vivid account of the effects of the of the cuts of

26:17.995 --> 26:25.304
aid to the Vietnamese—South Vietnamese forces, 
the Congress, and all the rest of it. Well, I

26:26.806 --> 26:37.659
remember you were writing how the South 
Vietnamese economy in 1972 was equitable to South

26:26.806 --> 26:37.659
Korea in the 60s. No, not the 60s. Oh, no, no, the 60s 
was the takeoff period in South Vietnam—end

26:39.401 --> 26:43.606
period. It was a time of peace, and they'd had time 
What I'm saying is that they built up, during the

26:46.582 --> 26:55.332
war, certain of the elements of what I call the 
preconditions for takeoff. One education, which

26:55.432 --> 26:58.515
is very, very important. They only had one 
institute of higher—well, they had no institute

26:59.416 --> 27:04.882
of higher learning in the South, under the French. 
The only university was Hanoi, and they built this

27:05.363 --> 27:11.830
series of universities, technical schools, very 
high degree of literacy. Secondly, agriculture.

27:14.527 --> 27:26.863
They began to bring in chemical fertilizers, some 
of the new seeds, and an American woman in aid

27:14.527 --> 27:26.863
brought in the chicken revolution.

27:28.645 --> 27:40.840
And then we sent out Stanford Research Institute 
to help them design a land reform program, which

27:28.645 --> 27:40.840
was instituted, and the tube got it through. It was 
a very hard thing to do. members of the Senate were

27:43.197 --> 27:44.979
mainly landlords. But they didn't have a big 
feudal agriculture, but they did have some. And so

27:49.726 --> 27:53.972
they had, then they had the other thing, a big 
infrastructure improvement. So during the war,

27:53.992 --> 28:05.087
certain fundamental things were happening, 
which at a time of peace, might have permitted

27:53.992 --> 28:05.087
them, it might have, would have permitted them to 
go into takeoff, but you couldn't do it with the war

27:53.992 --> 28:05.087
going on. But wasn't all that not so much due to the 
South Vietnamese government, but more to just

28:05.995 --> 28:14.126
Americans just pumping money into the economy? If 
you don't have people who can do it, you're pushing

28:15.548 --> 28:18.272
on a string.

28:20.856 --> 28:24.921
Do you ever think for a moment of how the South 
Vietnamese are doing in the United States? Do you

28:26.443 --> 28:33.353
see how many are winning science prizes, 
valedictorians, or going to college? You know,

28:34.109 --> 28:52.255
one of the things that really worries me about 
people, if we decided that we wanted to give up on

28:34.109 --> 28:52.255
them for whatever reasons we had a right to, and 
people will differ and argue about it for a long

28:34.109 --> 28:52.255
time, but you don't seem to realize what lies 
behind your questions. A systematic picture

28:52.536 --> 28:58.364
which tends to blame their defeat on the 
Vietnamese. They don't have nationalisms. They

29:02.257 --> 29:04.239
ran away at some battle.

29:07.903 --> 29:09.545
They didn't do anything for themselves. All they 
did was get American money. You've got a whole set

29:13.069 --> 29:14.431
of biases. I don't think you've ever examined 
them. Did you ever ask yourself what your general

29:17.093 --> 29:21.639
assumption is or your own view? Your questions are 
all—I've lived through this kind of questioning,

29:22.600 --> 29:28.046
and I don't mind it at all. I'm not annoyed. But I 
don't think your questions at all reflect any

29:30.995 --> 29:49.972
reading of what I've written about it, which is all 
right if you want to just try out your cliché

29:30.995 --> 29:49.972
questions on these poor bastards of South 
Vietnamese who deserved everything they got,

29:30.995 --> 29:49.972
which is your attitude and the basis for your 
questions. That's all right. But one of the most

29:51.593 --> 30:00.681
fundamental things in social science and 
history, if you're ever going to do it, is to be

29:51.593 --> 30:00.681
conscious of your own biases. And if you look in the 
back of this book, which I urge you to look at

30:01.049 --> 30:09.677
sometime, you'll find that I stated my own view of 
the U.S. national interest. Why? Because it, your

30:11.058 --> 30:15.762
assumptions control the questions you ask. What 
data you regard as relevant, what data you regard

30:16.803 --> 30:21.127
as irrelevant. And I don't sense that you've 
really given this any self-conscious thought and

30:21.147 --> 30:26.892
questioned yourself. After all, you're a new 
generation. And I don't know whether you're aware

30:30.698 --> 30:40.291
that President Carter and President Reagan have 
reaffirmed the relevance of the Southeast Asia

30:30.698 --> 30:40.291
Treaty to Thailand. Southeast Asia has not gone 
away. I think there's a fair chance there won't be a

30:44.937 --> 30:47.360
war out there. But, you know, it's in your lifetime 
that this place is still alive, and you've got to

30:47.440 --> 30:55.691
make up your mind as to its meaning. And I don't 
think you'll ever come to an understanding of

30:57.794 --> 31:00.638
that. unless you ask yourself, where did I get my 
ideas? What do I think? Where have I picked this up?

31:06.852 --> 31:07.393
Is that right?

31:11.156 --> 31:12.978
And, well, carry on. Go ahead with your questions. 
But they're an extraordinarily systematic set of

31:13.979 --> 31:20.524
questions, but they have nothing to do with 
anything I've ever written. Carry on. What

31:22.546 --> 31:27.270
pacification programs do you believe were 
successful and which were failures, and why? I

31:28.852 --> 31:31.654
don't think that you, in a pacification program, 
I'm speaking of Phoenix, Hess, the PRU teams.

31:36.559 --> 31:42.267
Well, I don't really know enough about them, but 
what I do know is two things. One, what you call

31:42.587 --> 31:54.722
pacification was a very uneven process in 
different parts of the country, and it depended a

31:42.587 --> 31:54.722
lot on the local people, the quality of 
leadership, the quality of some of the advisors.

31:55.158 --> 32:01.425
Two, I think that the overall picture that I have in 
here is pretty accurate, the statistical

31:55.158 --> 32:01.425
picture. Well, I remember you were writing about 
how you thought pacification was doing a good job

32:01.605 --> 32:10.574
and was successful, but— But what? I don't 
remember you mentioning any specific programs.

32:14.358 --> 32:16.200
You mentioned how— Well, that's what I'm saying 
now. What I'm saying is that this chart here of

32:16.481 --> 32:22.347
population status in South Vietnam I think is 
pretty fair, you know, accurate. Why do I think so?

32:30.754 --> 32:43.293
Because in the periods where we know things went 
bad, take 1965,

32:30.754 --> 32:43.293
these data show quite clearly a gain in the VC area 
of control. In this area of slow improvement in

32:44.595 --> 32:51.405
1966,

32:52.381 --> 32:53.502
It leveled off here. We know that about this 
period, they began to come into the north, and it

32:53.643 --> 33:00.451
slowed up our progress. We know there was a dip in 
Tet, much less than we thought at first, but there

33:01.172 --> 33:06.660
was a dip in Tet. And we know that in the course of 68 
to 69, they got badly rolled up, and their own

33:06.680 --> 33:20.177
evidence and everyone else's view, so that they 
were confined in this period pretty much to the the

33:21.153 --> 33:23.056
peripheral frontier. So I regard this—I think 
anybody who thinks he can measure that kind of

33:25.080 --> 33:35.137
thing in forty-odd provinces with great accuracy 
is kidding himself. On the other hand, if

33:36.779 --> 33:47.177
you take this, and if you can see that when it goes 
bad, you know, it's reflected And when things are

33:47.815 --> 33:49.618
going better, it's reflected. When it goes bad, 
it's reflected. In this period, when the VC were

33:51.060 --> 33:55.566
essentially washed out, it rolls up. Now, even 
then, I wouldn't believe this measure by itself.

34:01.235 --> 34:14.234
You've got to take everything that's 
quantitative, here's the ratio of enemy losses to

34:01.235 --> 34:14.234
ours, and see if it fits with everything else and if 
it fits with the qualitative evidence. Now, we had

34:14.274 --> 34:16.978
some of the ablest young men in our country Foreign 
service officers, AID officers, CIA officers,

34:17.954 --> 34:24.180
out in these villages, asked to read their 
reports. And if you read enough of them, you know,

34:25.562 --> 34:33.389
the picture would be very uneven, but you'd get a 
sense of what, of which way it was moving. And I

34:34.470 --> 34:38.494
think that's about the best you can do in a war of 
that kind, without a fixed front. Now, a fixed

34:38.514 --> 34:42.378
front, you see it visually, like a football game. 
But this was not that kind of war. It did not have a

34:44.761 --> 34:47.083
fixed front. all manner of quantitative and 
non-quantitative evidence to get a feel for which

34:47.452 --> 34:56.720
way it's drifting, and I think that picture is 
pretty accurate.

35:00.724 --> 35:15.417
Did journalists use their influence to get 
Americans against the war effort, or in general,

35:00.724 --> 35:15.417
did the media affect the outcome of the war?

35:22.265 --> 35:24.847
The outcome of the war is very hard. I think that the 
reporting on the whole was not very good. I think it

35:32.895 --> 35:38.279
was partly not very good for understandable 
reasons. A lot of the people that were assigned out

35:39.080 --> 35:43.864
there had never dealt with a developing country 
before. A lot of them never really got outside the

35:45.926 --> 35:50.010
Caravelle Hotel much. When they did, they'd much 
rather go with a US unit than a South Vietnamese

35:51.087 --> 35:55.673
unit. And for good reason, they spoke the language 
and it was safer. And I don't hold that against

36:00.219 --> 36:02.502
them. The big thing they did, of course, was 
grossly to misinterpret Tet and misreport it. On

36:10.132 --> 36:17.922
the other hand, I don't think they deserve

36:20.568 --> 36:21.128
Well, let me put it. I think

36:21.169 --> 36:27.234
the media earned that. You shouldn't expect them 
to report a war very well. A war is a very hard thing

36:29.516 --> 36:31.057
to report. It's an emotional thing. And in

36:34.160 --> 36:44.008
a democracy, virtually all wars are going to be 
very, very divisive. This Revolutionary War was

36:45.810 --> 36:48.432
terribly divisive. The War of 1812 New England 
people were marching on Washington, trying to get

36:50.740 --> 36:55.328
out of the Union. From Hartford, the Mexican War 
was extremely divisive, regionally. Civil War,

37:02.760 --> 37:03.722
of course. The Spanish-American War was very 
divisive. First World War was divisive. And we

37:09.071 --> 37:09.992
didn't get into the second. We were so divided that 
the only reason we got into the Second World War is

37:10.012 --> 37:14.239
we got attacked at Pearl Harbor. The Germans 
declared And, you know, in the Korean War, Mr.

37:15.850 --> 37:21.898
Truman ended up with lower polls than Mr. Nixon 
when he left the White House. So war is a dreadful

37:23.780 --> 37:25.482
thing. And in a democracy, I'd expect it, 
especially if it runs, if it's all protracted,

37:27.204 --> 37:37.437
that it would be divisive.

37:38.007 --> 37:41.331
So I'm not inclined to blame the press 
excessively. I think they did a bad job and had some

37:42.232 --> 37:55.448
considerable influence on the view of Tet, but I 
think that President Johnson and our

37:42.232 --> 37:55.448
administration didn't explain before the event 
as much as we should have about Tet, which we knew

37:42.232 --> 37:55.448
was coming. So, I mean, it's part of it, but I don't 
want to produce a, you know, I don't believe that

37:56.590 --> 38:06.782
somehow the press should be made a scapegoat uh did 
the what was the role of the anti-war movement did

38:08.197 --> 38:33.090
that affect decision making as far as you want to 
keep your popularity up possibly and if you see

38:08.197 --> 38:33.090
these hundreds of thousands of kids protesting in 
front of the tv camera and then you're sitting down

38:08.197 --> 38:33.090
at your 5 30 dinner and then you see this too and then 
that makes you think did the anti-war movement

38:08.197 --> 38:33.090
possibly affect decision making as far as maybe 
Let's speak of Tet. Maybe after Tet, General

38:35.142 --> 38:44.033
Westmoreland requested 206,000 more troops, and 
he got, I believe, 50,000 or 80,000 more. Well, he

38:45.755 --> 38:48.078
didn't get more troops. First, because he didn't 
have M-16s, it turned out. And I don't know how

38:52.423 --> 39:02.976
that- and

38:52.423 --> 39:02.976
it's a very amusing story, in a way, because Chew 
mobilized a whole 150,000 or whatever it was

39:03.850 --> 39:06.554
there. And the president said, well, if it was a 
choice between giving them 16 South Vietnamese

39:06.574 --> 39:13.663
and Americans, I know which way it was going. Also, 
there were some financial considerations. And

39:16.567 --> 39:25.099
also, by the time they came around to make the 
decision, the president made the decision before

39:16.567 --> 39:25.099
it got into the newspapers, it was palpable that 
She was, the South Vietnamese, well, had been a

39:25.366 --> 39:31.174
real military victory on our side. There was some 
ambiguity until we could establish, especially,

39:31.394 --> 39:37.944
it took a little while to establish what we'd lost 
in the countryside. And it turned out we didn't

39:38.665 --> 39:46.756
lose anything because they were out of the 
countryside and South Vietnamese were out of the

39:38.665 --> 39:46.756
countryside and the people were just growing rice 
there. But in any case, what was your question

39:46.776 --> 39:51.643
again? Did the war or the anti-war movement? The 
anti-war movement, I would say it's a hard

39:53.889 --> 39:56.612
question. It did not affect any of the basic 
decisions because, see right down to Tet, 60% of

39:56.632 --> 40:06.481
the people defined themselves as hawks. 
President Johnson was much more worried about the

40:07.161 --> 40:10.805
hawks than he was about the doves. And what 
actually weakened the war effort was the

40:12.446 --> 40:20.213
defection of the hawks on their 
misinterpretation of Tet. rather than the rise of

40:20.834 --> 40:24.157
the Doves. But the reason I'm hesitant is that the 
overall decisions, I'd say no.

40:32.806 --> 40:40.273
But as far as President Johnson is concerned, 
decisions in the war are concerned.

40:41.094 --> 40:50.503
But as for individual

40:41.094 --> 40:50.503
people in the administration, I cannot vouch for 
their effects on individuals. had no effect on me.

40:56.886 --> 41:00.472
You talked about a lot how— Let me tell you why. I had 
thought I was luckier than most, in a peculiar

41:00.492 --> 41:08.624
sense, if I was going to get involved in this. 
Because in the 1950s,

41:08.644 --> 41:19.900
after I'd done a study of the Soviet Union that 
turned out to be quite useful at the time of

41:08.644 --> 41:19.900
Stalin's The government asked me to do a study of 
China and Asia. And I said, well, I'd prove this

41:26.656 --> 41:30.439
could be done usefully, and let's get somebody 
else to do it. Max Milliken and I had set up this

41:31.160 --> 41:39.567
Center for International Studies at MIT, but no 
one would touch it because of McCarthy and all

41:31.160 --> 41:39.567
that. And so they came back to me, and my wife, who 
was very wise, suggested it be a good thing to do,

41:39.607 --> 41:46.774
and I did it. And so I had a chance in tranquility to 
look very far back and very far forward. and wrote

41:52.887 --> 41:57.695
two books, one called Prospects for Communist 
China and another American Policy in Asia. So this

41:58.736 --> 42:10.795
whole array of issues that we were thrust into in 
the Kennedy administration

41:58.736 --> 42:10.795
were familiar to me, and I had a chance to quietly to 
think it through. for a lot of people, they got hit

42:11.872 --> 42:23.886
like a blindside block, and they'd thought about 
arms control, or developing areas, or reform of

42:11.872 --> 42:23.886
NATO, or education, or civil rights, or whatever, 
all those. But very few had given much thought to

42:24.647 --> 42:30.334
the strategic problems of Asia, or the future of 
Asia. And in that sense, I was lucky, and I'd come to

42:37.133 --> 42:42.121
serious conclusions, as I say, and in fact publish 
them with no mystery about my view. So that when,

42:43.222 --> 42:53.057
you know, the confusions and pressures of the war 
and debates arose, I knew what I thought and why. In

42:53.097 --> 43:01.470
that sense, more at peace than many of my 
colleagues who were very much, and

42:53.097 --> 43:01.470
understandably, torn up by all this. You 
mentioned McCarthy and the Red Scare. Did a lot of

43:04.538 --> 43:11.747
good people get taken out of the State Department 
because of that, in your opinion, especially

43:04.538 --> 43:11.747
possibly Southeast Asian experts? Because a lot 
of people believe that we should have recognized

43:13.370 --> 43:26.226
mainland China by, say, 1955, 1956, that 
recognizing Taiwan as the leader of the great

43:13.370 --> 43:26.226
nation of that size was a mistake.

43:30.509 --> 43:34.795
I don't think it had anything to do with anybody in 
the State Department. Well, they've just said

43:34.815 --> 43:38.420
that a lot of people just did not know a lot about 
Vietnam. I know. I know that people say a lot of

43:38.901 --> 43:43.648
things, but there are a lot of people that did know a 
lot about Vietnam. Well, our problem was not that

43:43.668 --> 43:47.113
we didn't know a lot about Vietnam. We know a great 
deal. Okay. You mentioned that you all felt that

43:52.120 --> 43:59.250
Tet was about to happen, and I remember reading how 
you said you were You'd wish you had asked

43:59.939 --> 44:04.272
President Johnson to speak more about it in the 
State of the Union Address. Why, then, was the

44:06.299 --> 44:13.240
716th Military Police Battalion the only 
American unit in Saigon attacked? We had a

44:15.127 --> 44:20.175
tremendous—we'd pulled back a couple of 
divisions around Saigon. They were wonderfully

44:20.195 --> 44:23.520
prepared for Tet. The U.S. forces were absolutely 
geared up for Tet. Well, we had a man who was in the

44:29.008 --> 44:34.897
716th, and he was in Saigon. Why don't you go and you 
read the evidence on it? For goodness sakes,

44:38.093 --> 44:44.520
I mean, you get somebody to come in and you get one 
detainee. Did you ever read Westmoreland's

44:46.402 --> 44:50.026
cables to President Johnson before Tet? Do you 
know what President Johnson told his cabinet

44:50.046 --> 44:53.090
before Tet? Well, I knew he knew it was going to 
happen and that he wanted to get everybody

44:53.991 --> 45:01.359
prepared and that Westmoreland was acting to get 
his forces ready for him. And he did get them ready,

45:01.379 --> 45:06.565
and he called off the American forces, had the 
leave canceled. they were pulled back around

45:06.848 --> 45:08.851
Saigon. And, you know, there's a vast amount of 
evidence on this. Okay. What a mistake. You know,

45:18.267 --> 45:32.650
if you have some guy who says something, then you 
better say, well, you know, the war's very, if

45:18.267 --> 45:32.650
you're aware in one place in the war, that's a very 
important place in the war. But it doesn't mean

45:33.111 --> 45:33.852
that A guy who's in some unit really knows where the 
other units are, what orders his commander's

45:34.422 --> 45:40.264
issued. And those are things that can be found out 
and can be checked.
