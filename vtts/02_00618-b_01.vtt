WEBVTT

00:11.945 --> 00:14.788
Well, after we'd set this thing up, I went off back 
to the Admiralty. And a month or so, I went over to

00:15.328 --> 00:17.250
have a look at it. It was rather like Henry VIII 
visiting Trinity. You know, the founder come to

00:20.834 --> 00:23.336
visit the thing. And the people were all quite 
enthusiastic about it, because they'd otherwise

00:23.356 --> 00:27.880
have been fighting in the Battle of the Bulwark. 
And it was really, really great fun. The first time

00:31.444 --> 00:37.750
I went over, it was foggy and the Air Force couldn't 
take us over. I got on to the operations at Dover and

00:38.371 --> 00:42.318
said, look, can you take us over to France? They 
said, sure. And we were actually the first, we went

00:43.140 --> 00:50.374
over in a motor torpedo boat, and we were the first 
vessel into Boulogne after it was liberated,

00:43.140 --> 00:50.374
after the Germans got out. It was interesting to 
see a place that we were the first people into.

00:56.104 --> 00:58.509
Nothing had been done, just as left by the Germans. 
All the port destroyed, everything blown up. and

01:02.418 --> 01:28.358
then we went back to paris and along the roads of 
course where all the bridges were blown

01:02.418 --> 01:28.358
everything was wrecked and then then we worked our 
way we got into brussels just after it was

01:02.418 --> 01:28.358
liberated wonderful with all the rejoicings of 
the liberation the the capture we were got in just

01:02.418 --> 01:28.358
after the capture of the luftwaffe's wine cellar 
by the second technical air force we did very well

01:02.418 --> 01:28.358
there and then we set up advanced headquarters in 
Berlin. We had all kinds of organizations, really

01:32.536 --> 01:37.500
great fun, and not very serious, of course. Well, 
then when the German war was over, I decided I

01:39.222 --> 01:48.130
really didn't want to sit out the Japanese war as 
well. So I went back to Cambridge in, I think, the

01:48.190 --> 01:53.434
war ended in August. Yes, beginning of July, I went 
back to Cambridge. It obviously wasn't going to be

01:56.917 --> 01:58.699
very long. The last job I did, was it the last? No, it 
was just one interesting thing. It wasn't much to

02:06.189 --> 02:13.356
do with oceanography, but the question was raised 
about a year or 18 months before the end of the war.

02:14.057 --> 02:28.551
The Combined Chiefs of Staff were told to produce a 
plan for defeating Japan within a year of the

02:14.057 --> 02:28.551
defeat of Germany, because it was thought that the 
British and public would not stand the war in Japan

02:28.868 --> 02:35.274
going on for more than a year after the defeat of 
Germany, which seemed quite likely. And everyone

02:36.075 --> 02:41.941
got in on this act in one way or another, 
considering this question. It involved, first of

02:42.001 --> 02:49.448
all, deciding when Germany was going to be 
defeated, and secondly, deciding on a plan for

02:42.001 --> 02:49.448
defeating Japan within a year thereafter. Well, 
it was got completely wrong. It was decided that

02:55.936 --> 02:59.239
Germany would be defeated in the late fall of 44. In 
fact, they lasted six months longer, seven months

02:59.900 --> 03:02.823
longer. And it was decided that Japan could not be 
defeated within a year thereafter. It couldn't be

03:07.787 --> 03:12.572
defeated by the fall of 45. And they were both 
wrong. And it's very interesting, showing with

03:14.394 --> 03:23.783
really very experienced, very intelligent 
people considering these matters, you get it

03:14.394 --> 03:23.783
completely wrong. on the effect of the bombing of 
Japan. I underestimated the effects because I

03:26.334 --> 03:33.264
didn't believe what the Air Force said. In Europe, 
we'd always divided Air Force estimates by pi

03:33.404 --> 03:40.975
because they were always over-optimistic. In 
Japan, Japan was much more inflammable and they

03:41.436 --> 03:49.127
really had done much more damage than the same 
weight of bombs in Europe. We discounted the We

03:51.995 --> 04:04.430
also thought it would take longer to develop 
airfields on the islands when they were captured

03:51.995 --> 04:04.430
than it actually did because it involved 
bulldozing the tops off all the hills to set up

03:51.995 --> 04:04.430
airfields. We discounted the effects of the atom 
bomb because we didn't believe it were ready in

04:04.970 --> 04:09.075
time. We didn't think the first test would work. We 
thought it would all take longer. And so he said for

04:14.902 --> 04:19.167
planning purposes one should not assume it would 
work. So it is a very odd thing and interesting.

04:22.422 --> 04:33.175
It's nothing to do with oceanography, but it's 
interesting how really the best and most careful

04:22.422 --> 04:33.175
consideration by the military experts and their 
civilian advisors arrived at completely wrong

04:22.422 --> 04:33.175
answers. Well, now, we've now reached the end of 
the war. But I have a couple of questions I want to

04:38.261 --> 04:42.426
ask you before we reach totally upon the end.

04:45.890 --> 04:50.115
When you're working in terms of gravity 
experiments on submarines, Was

04:50.500 --> 04:57.130
this involved in warfare? No, not at all. I didn't 
think so. There was no military application at all

04:59.713 --> 05:03.639
at the time. It has certain applications now, but 
that's nothing to do with what we're talking about

05:04.660 --> 05:10.869
now. There are questions of the trajectories of 
ballistic missiles. The calculation of those

05:16.217 --> 05:19.562
involves a knowledge of variations of gravity. 
But at the time we were doing it, it had no military

05:19.812 --> 05:23.596
application. And when you were in charge of 
degassing in terms of mines, did you not in turn

05:23.616 --> 05:33.047
invent a kind of mine which was much more 
effective? Yes. Where did you hear that? Oh, I

05:34.749 --> 05:36.831
just... Where did you pick that up? Roger Revelle. 
Yes, that's true. This man, Ben Brown, whom I

05:40.395 --> 05:47.003
talked about before as the man who measured 
gravity in submarines, he stayed in the

05:40.395 --> 05:47.003
anti-submarine establishment. He suffered 
fools much more gladly than I did. And he stayed

05:49.613 --> 05:50.534
there. And he and I, between us, I think I 
originally invented it, and he did some

05:51.155 --> 05:56.362
experiments to see whether it was practical. We 
invented a pressure mine, which worked when a ship

05:56.402 --> 06:07.477
goes over an object on the bottom, there is a 
reduction of pressure as it goes over. And we

06:07.497 --> 06:09.440
invented a mine which worked this way. Well, it was 
decided to be too dangerous for us to use it because

06:15.685 --> 06:16.946
we had no means of sweeping it. I put a lot of work 
into developing methods of sweeping with no

06:17.227 --> 06:25.015
success and so it was really a very dangerous thing 
and it was decided not to use it. It was used, the

06:26.277 --> 06:38.770
Germans must have invented it independently, it 
was used right at the end of the war in the Scheldt

06:26.277 --> 06:38.770
Estuary out when they evacuated Holland and it was 
used extensively by the Americans in the last

06:26.277 --> 06:38.770
stages of the Japanese war. Now when you go back I 
don't know whether the American invention was

06:42.601 --> 06:45.765
independent. I think not. Well, my impression is 
it was not. That was a conversation I drew from

06:49.050 --> 06:50.772
Ravel. Well, I think that's only because I told 
Ravel I thought it was not independent. Okay.

06:59.223 --> 07:02.207
After you leave and affect the War Office and... 
The Admiralty. The Admiralty, rather, and you go

07:03.128 --> 07:08.436
back to Cambridge, you list yourself as a reader in 
geophysics. Well, I started off Yes, that's

07:10.107 --> 07:11.569
right. I went back as a reader. Reader is the second 
level. It's roughly associate professor. In an

07:19.737 --> 07:26.384
English university in those days, there used to be 
one professor in each subject.

07:27.205 --> 07:33.812
Occasionally in a very large department there'd 
be two, but there was normally only one professor,

07:27.205 --> 07:33.812
and the other people were called mostly 
lecturers. Lecturer is the normal grade of an

07:34.252 --> 07:37.195
academic. One reader is a slightly superior 
grade, and a professor is a very superior person

07:38.086 --> 07:46.919
who runs the department. I never became a 
professor in Cambridge until the 60s. I was in my

07:52.928 --> 07:55.672
late 50s when I became a professor. You know, but 
while I have you listed as a reader in geophysics, I

07:56.533 --> 08:03.924
also have you listed working still for the Navy for 
four years. Is that erroneous? That is erroneous.

08:07.499 --> 08:37.438
always i've always been on naval committees after 
the war advisory committees of one sort or another

08:07.499 --> 08:37.438
but i uh did i've never been employed by the navy 
since the war i left i left in somewhere about june

08:07.499 --> 08:37.438
of 45. all right so then you you do indeed go to 
cambridge i go to cambridge and i become a reader

08:07.499 --> 08:37.438
and then we we started up again and i think in 
retrospect I was rather incompetent. I didn't try

08:40.632 --> 08:43.495
and expand the thing as rapid as I should. I didn't 
try and get money as rapid as I should do. I think in

08:46.658 --> 08:52.743
spite of everything, Rutherford's dislike of 
collecting money to some extent rubbed off on me. I

08:52.863 --> 08:55.526
wasn't nearly ambitious enough. And I didn't 
press the university enough. And I got a lot of

08:58.989 --> 09:01.691
graduate students. I mean, people wanted to come 
and work. I got prestige by the wartime. There was

09:08.435 --> 09:10.217
great interest in seismology. One of the first 
things we took up was the use of wartime

09:10.277 --> 09:15.062
explosives. And we had a project that was 6,000 
tons of explosive, I think it was, in Heligoland in

09:16.163 --> 09:23.071
a cave. And it was decided that it was dangerous to 
get it out, and the Navy decided to detonate it. And

09:30.098 --> 09:37.446
I heard about this and decided to organize a large 
scale seismological operation to observe this

09:30.098 --> 09:37.446
explosion. And we managed to find all kinds of 
other dumps of surplus explosive and let them off.

09:42.118 --> 09:43.881
I mean, a few hundred tons here and there. And so in 
Germany, where it was easy to do anything in

09:44.522 --> 09:49.248
Germany, just after the war, of course, we were the 
heron folk. We couldn't do anything. We bloody

09:50.329 --> 09:51.130
were light. And so we went around blowing up bits of 
Germany and blew up Heligoland. The first time I

09:56.978 --> 10:02.766
met the environmental movement, there were a 
whole lot of people who said we frightened the

09:56.978 --> 10:02.766
birds on Heligoland. Heligoland was some kind of 
bird sanctuary. So we took a cinema film. of the

10:07.598 --> 10:08.559
operation. And when we let off the 6,000 tons on the 
island in this cave, all the birds flew off. They

10:16.672 --> 10:19.856
all got up and they circled around for about a 
quarter of an hour and sat down again. And that's

10:20.297 --> 10:22.020
all that happened. Well anyway, I had a graduate 
student looking after this and it was very

10:23.382 --> 10:34.017
interesting seeing Germany immediately after 
the defeat. You know, the complete collapse of

10:36.725 --> 10:40.891
their view of themselves as the heron folk. None of 
them knew what to do or what they wanted to do, and

10:42.293 --> 10:46.439
they just waited to be told. And I remember I had 
meetings, I went to the

10:47.221 --> 11:05.027
Göttingen, where there was a man called Bartels, 
who was a very well-known German geophysicist,

10:47.221 --> 11:05.027
who I'd taken something of his life to. a supporter 
of the Nazi party. When I went to see him, one of the

11:09.343 --> 11:13.447
offices still had a picture of Goebbels in it. And I 
thought Mr. Bartels, well, that was either a crook

11:14.388 --> 11:20.554
or a knave. And then, he was very nice to me, of 
course, and very anxious to collaborate in this

11:21.455 --> 11:28.962
blowing up of Helga Land. Of course, to any 
scientist who had had a motor car, we fitted it out

11:32.378 --> 11:37.627
with tyres in order that they could take 
instruments around and set them up for us. So there

11:37.687 --> 11:44.039
was a good deal of a head out of us, and also there 
were certificates, we supplied certificates to

11:37.687 --> 11:44.039
people that they went Nazis. So there was a good 
deal of enthusiasm working for us. And we got very

11:48.547 --> 11:51.232
good collaboration from them. A very curious 
thing happened. They said, would you like to see

11:53.856 --> 11:55.399
the Gauss? place where Gauss made his magnetic 
observations. And I said, yes, I'd very much like

11:58.445 --> 12:00.708
to see it. So we went out with Bartels and his 
various henchmen, lovely summer day of 45,

12:00.728 --> 12:08.058
through the woods. And there was a little wooden 
hut where Gauss made his magnetic observations a

12:09.099 --> 12:14.827
hundred and something years before. And I went up, 
opened the door and go in, and found it was locked.

12:18.952 --> 12:20.454
And they said, oh, the door is locked. It is locked 
to Schlosser. And I said, yeah. And Schlosser And

12:25.467 --> 12:27.569
they said, no, it gives consciousness. There was 
no key. And so I said, and it's not a rat. And I said, I

12:33.695 --> 12:36.037
wish to see the interior of this building. And they 
said, there is no key. And I said, well, please

12:37.519 --> 12:38.960
break the door in. And I sat down on the doorstep and 
waited for them to break the door in. And then I

12:42.924 --> 12:45.647
produced a key from his pocket and opened it. I 
walked in, completely empty hut, nothing

12:46.548 --> 12:52.774
whatever there, except a little table against one 
wall. a vase of fresh flowers on it, and a picture of

12:53.193 --> 12:58.380
some Nazi tough over it. They'd made a little 
shrine there. And imagine the stupidity of taking

13:00.622 --> 13:05.889
me out there on the off chance that I wouldn't smell 
a rat. But it's very interesting, you see, there

13:07.751 --> 13:15.782
was no question, as soon as I said I wish this door to 
be broken in, there was no question at all of

13:07.751 --> 13:15.782
opposing me in any way. I didn't say anything, I 
didn't tell anyone, I just told them I thought

13:18.505 --> 13:22.390
they'd better get it removed.

13:25.762 --> 13:26.683
Very odd, indeed. I went, I don't know whether the 
stories of this sort are at all relevant to you.

13:32.351 --> 13:32.631
Right, right. A little later, it must be later the 
same year, I think, I went over again, and I went,

13:32.651 --> 13:42.805
was it Goettingen again? I'm not sure. It was some, 
I've forgotten now where it was exactly, but the

13:44.547 --> 13:54.520
Erdenamische Versuchsanstalt of the Luftwaffe 
were there, the Luftwaffe's research

13:44.547 --> 13:54.520
establishment. No, this was later. This was a year 
or so later. Sorry, this story comes a little

13:59.299 --> 14:02.483
later. I became disenchanted with the department 
in Cambridge. The thing that finally tipped it was

14:08.071 --> 14:15.161
that I had a typist coming in two afternoons a week. 
And I wanted her every afternoon, and the

14:16.203 --> 14:20.068
university refused. Well, I'd explained to them 
before I came back to Cambridge and became a reader

14:20.825 --> 14:27.831
that geophysics was going to be an expensive 
operation. And then when they refused to let me

14:28.392 --> 14:33.196
have a typist half time, I felt this was not 
reasonable. And that afternoon, a man came in who

14:33.236 --> 14:46.827
asked me whether I would take a job in Canada as head 
of the physics department in Canada. Well, this

14:47.028 --> 14:49.870
was the largest physics department in the British 
Empire and Obviously a prestigious job with a very

14:50.187 --> 14:55.713
good pay, paid $10,000 a year, which is a lot of 
money in those days. And so I took this job. I knew I

14:59.117 --> 15:02.801
didn't want it, and I knew I wasn't going to like it. 
But I was so annoyed at having been turned down over

15:03.802 --> 15:08.487
this typist that I took the job. And I went out to 
Canada, my wife and four children. And my wife took

15:13.312 --> 15:17.697
an enormous dislike to Canada and wouldn't stay 
there. And I rather wanted to get out too. I think,

15:21.011 --> 15:26.276
in other circumstances, if my wife hadn't 
disliked it, I'd probably have stayed. I don't

15:26.336 --> 15:27.017
know. I think I'd probably come down here because I 
came down, while I was in Canada, I came down here

15:27.557 --> 15:36.686
for the summer and was offered the directorship of 
scripts before Ravel got it. And I decided against

15:37.747 --> 15:39.329
it. Of course, my wife wanted to get back to England 
and I wanted to get back to England. And I went and

15:45.453 --> 15:51.179
saw President Sproul and recommended Ravel. And 
there was a good deal of opposition to Ravel down

15:51.499 --> 15:54.082
here. And I told him to overrule it and then the 
locals would settle down and make Ravel

15:54.723 --> 15:59.908
directives. He did. Well, anyway, so I had this 
short time in Canada. And during that time in

16:05.294 --> 16:08.998
Canada, I came down here for the summer. In the 
summer of 49, I spent down here. And I got an

16:12.542 --> 16:15.325
enormous amount done in this period. I built an 
apparatus for measuring heat flow down here,

16:16.013 --> 16:27.367
working with Art Maxwell, who's now Deputy 
Director of Woods Hole, and who was then a graduate

16:16.013 --> 16:27.367
student here. And it's interesting looking back 
that there was not enough workshop effort to get

16:28.489 --> 16:35.758
the machine built. It wasn't a very complicated 
thing. And so I said that Maxwell and I would build

16:39.483 --> 16:43.067
it, and we worked in the workshop. And I spent a good 
deal of the summer working in the workshop here,

16:43.722 --> 16:49.830
making this apparatus, which we just got finished 
at the end. We didn't get any measurements with it

16:49.910 --> 16:52.253
that summer. But we got it built, and we showed that 
it would work, and everything was all right. And I

16:56.839 --> 16:59.002
went home and built another one, and that gave 
measurements. And Maxwell built another one

16:59.082 --> 17:03.688
here, slightly different, and that worked. So I 
did that that summer. I also wrote a long paper on

17:05.831 --> 17:13.020
the Earth's magnetic field, on the westward drift 
of the Earth's magnetic field. And I started to

17:13.304 --> 17:18.310
think about the origin of the Earth's magnetic 
field. I'd started to think about it just before I

17:18.571 --> 17:20.954
left England. I did a lot of work on that while I was 
in Canada and while I was down here. And in

17:25.740 --> 17:35.833
retrospect, I think this was my most prolific 
period, the time in Canada and the time down here in

17:25.740 --> 17:35.833
the two or three months in the summer of 1948. And 
then, in the course of all this, I got offered the

17:37.214 --> 17:42.501
job of Director of the National Physical 
Laboratory and very foolishly I took that. It was a

17:50.038 --> 17:55.448
lousy job in many ways and the Lord didn't intend me 
for a civil servant. And I got along alright. I got a

17:58.613 --> 18:06.447
good deal of my own work done actually and I 
directed the lab without any major scandal

17:58.613 --> 18:06.447
occurring and I think I cheer the place up a bit. It 
was rather a depressing, slow-moving place and I

18:09.075 --> 18:15.663
think I got a certain amount done and I became... I 
remember thinking one day, what can the director

18:16.724 --> 18:19.808
of this place do? What influence has he got? 
There's a large staff, something like 1,500

18:22.311 --> 18:25.375
people. What can you do as director of the 
establishment? And I decided there were only two

18:27.939 --> 18:29.801
things you could do. First of all, you could 
interview everyone they hired of a scientific

18:29.841 --> 18:36.990
kind so as to make sure you did hire bright people 
and not merely people who wouldn't be a nuisance.

18:42.443 --> 18:46.688
And so I insisted on interviewing every single 
scientific officer who came into the place. And

18:47.509 --> 18:49.811
secondly, we have large controlled budgets. And 
in effect, I was being given a lump of money. And so

18:53.736 --> 19:00.784
things I thought went doing well, because they 
weren't being well run, I could starve them of

18:53.736 --> 19:00.784
money. And use the money to reinforce success, so 
to speak, and not to boost up failure. And so on the

19:08.070 --> 19:13.418
whole, I think I did a certain amount of good to that 
show. Well, I stayed in Canada two years, and I

19:13.438 --> 19:19.768
stayed six years at the National Physical Lab. I 
went there at the beginning of 1951, I think.

19:28.557 --> 19:34.185
And I stayed there till the end of 1955, which is six 
years. Let me just get this right. I came to Canada

19:36.489 --> 19:43.339
in March 48, and I left at the end of 49, that's 
right. So I went to the National Physical Lab in

19:43.359 --> 19:49.669
January 50, and I stayed till December 56, which is 
six years. And then I went back to Cambridge. By

19:54.957 --> 19:56.539
this time, this man Brown, had taken over as head of 
the department and reader. He wasn't a professor.

20:01.791 --> 20:02.872
He took over as reader. And I went back as the bottom 
man on the totem pole. I didn't become a reader. I

20:10.342 --> 20:15.369
went back as an assistant director of research, 
which was more or less the bottom man on the totem

20:10.342 --> 20:15.369
pole. And it was regarded as highly eccentric. I'd 
left one of the prestigious scientific jobs of the

20:17.832 --> 20:23.640
world to go back as something a little less than a 
lecturer. It was extremely successful for me

20:24.886 --> 20:30.371
personally.

20:31.772 --> 20:32.833
I could do what I liked. I could get on with my own 
work again. I could have work with graduate

20:34.515 --> 20:36.857
students. I was paid very little by the 
university, but I made it up by consulting. I

20:42.322 --> 20:45.725
became a consultant to Shell and a consultant to 
Rio Tinto. And in the first year, I made a great deal

20:46.706 --> 20:51.750
more money than I ever made as director of the 
National Physical Lab. So that was extremely

20:52.851 --> 20:54.673
satisfactory.

20:58.771 --> 21:06.058
I also had you listed as director of IBM while you 
were- Yes, well, I tell you, I became a consultant

20:58.771 --> 21:06.058
at Shell. And I was a consultant at Shell for a long 
while, I mean, until the 60s. I left the NPL in 56,

21:13.366 --> 21:18.931
and I remained a consultant at Shell for six or 
eight years. And I then found, I used to go over to

21:20.012 --> 21:24.897
Holland about once or two months, once a month. and 
talked to the research lab on exploration

21:25.400 --> 21:33.810
production there, go round and look at things, and 
I got all bored with it. They knew what I'd say, and I

21:33.830 --> 21:38.655
knew what they'd say, and I felt I wasn't having 
much effect. I think I ought probably to have spent

21:39.816 --> 21:45.263
more time on their affairs and been more 
insistent. But anyway, I gave them six months'

21:45.283 --> 21:49.247
notice to terminate the country. And I didn't know 
what I was going to do. I didn't know what other job I

21:51.734 --> 21:56.218
knew I would take up something else with industry. 
And suddenly one day I was offered a job as director

21:56.799 --> 22:01.784
of IBM in England. This was a tremendous success. I 
enjoyed IBM enormously. They felt they'd like to

22:06.709 --> 22:12.536
have somewhat, most of the board of IBM UK were 
financiers. They were bankers from whom people

22:12.576 --> 22:18.542
borrowed money, accountants, merchant bankers, 
this kind of thing. and a number of employees of the

22:18.944 --> 22:23.528
company, and they thought they'd like to have 
someone different. And I don't know quite why they

22:23.548 --> 22:27.452
selected me, but it just suited me. Is this the 
first time you've become involved with

22:28.272 --> 22:30.454
computers? No, I'd been interested in computers 
all along. One of the earliest computers was built

22:34.618 --> 22:39.202
at the National Physical Lab while I was there. I 
knew Jonathan Neumann when I was in Canada. We'd

22:43.446 --> 22:46.909
set up a computing center there with one of the 
first computers. I'd been down to see Jonathan

22:47.480 --> 22:51.083
Neumann, who was building one of the first ones. 
I'd seen something during the war of the

22:51.984 --> 23:00.932
cryptographic computers, whose existence has 
recently been revealed. So I was deeply

23:02.994 --> 23:09.580
interested in computers, and I was practically 
the only man on the board in anything about them.

23:10.361 --> 23:15.045
It's been suggested that you were in the vanguard 
of placing computers into British science. Would

23:15.085 --> 23:16.947
you agree with that statement? certainly I was one 
of the first people who took them seriously in

23:17.770 --> 23:47.271
geophysics I mean computers are used for two 
things in science one is data analysis if you've

23:17.770 --> 23:47.271
got a subject like astronomy or geophysics where 
there's an enormous amount of information badly

23:17.770 --> 23:47.271
contaminated with noise then you need a computer 
to analyse the data and I was certainly early in

23:17.770 --> 23:47.271
this business I did a lot of the early programming 
for

23:47.555 --> 23:56.505
recording data on board ship and then analyzing it 
after you got home. Now, of course, you do the

23:56.525 --> 24:00.029
analysis as well at sea because you have the 
computers at sea. But at that time, the computers

24:00.089 --> 24:06.257
were on land and you brought the data back on paper 
tape and put it into the computers. And I did a lot of

24:06.297 --> 24:11.883
programming and experimental work on data 
analysis in oceanography.

24:15.828 --> 24:17.089
This I... when I got back to Cambridge, I used to 
visit here in the summer from the late 50s onwards.

24:25.292 --> 24:36.487
And I worked here with Walter Monk and Flicka down 
the corridor, Flicka Dolma, Flicka Oglebay as it

24:25.292 --> 24:36.487
was, on general programs for analyzing data. So I 
think I did have substantial influence on the

24:37.268 --> 24:45.379
adoption of computers for data analysis in 
geophysics. And the other side of the use of

24:48.963 --> 24:53.308
computers in science is their use for analyzing 
models. If you have a phenomenon, say an ice age or a

24:53.809 --> 25:03.200
tsunami or something of this sort, or the tides, 
then you have a theory of it. And your theory is a

25:03.821 --> 25:07.165
simplified model of reality. And you want to 
predict what this model will say about the

25:07.766 --> 25:14.734
observations, about what should happen, and then 
compare what actually happens and what the theory

25:14.883 --> 25:17.246
gives. And this is quite a different sort of 
computing. It's solving differential equations

25:19.850 --> 25:21.913
and things. And I haven't... I did some of this in 
the magnetic field business, the origin of the

25:24.596 --> 25:30.945
Earth's magnetic field. And so that I think on both 
sides I did something. I was in that when I was at the

25:35.331 --> 25:38.295
National Physical Lab. I started doing that. 
Being director of the lab, I could get as much

25:40.178 --> 25:43.422
computer time as I wanted... The National 
Physical Lab, though, was not defense-oriented,

25:44.566 --> 25:47.349
was it? No. Okay, I don't think so. No, it was 
industry-oriented. It was particularly

25:52.295 --> 25:53.356
standards. When did you first become interested 
in heat flow? I first became interested in heat

25:59.804 --> 26:03.408
flow in the middle 30s. I remember talking to 
Jeffries about it. I was interested... I think my

26:13.203 --> 26:20.670
first interest was how reliable were the few 
measurements we had. Wait a minute now, now my

26:21.331 --> 26:30.379
first interest, Jeffries talked to me about the 
shortage of heat flow measurements, there were

26:21.331 --> 26:30.379
very few. I wrote a historical article on the 
history of heat flow measurement. What had

26:37.927 --> 26:39.328
happened was,

26:45.805 --> 26:53.816
I've become, well, I think to go into the details of 
Mr. Lee is really rather unnecessary, but Mr. Lee

26:45.805 --> 26:53.816
was a graduate student here. And for reasons that 
are too complicated to describe, I got him made

26:54.897 --> 27:04.410
Secretary of the International Keep Flow 
Committee when he was about 22 or 23, I suppose.

27:04.891 --> 27:08.356
Enormously energetic man, determined to make his 
fortune, his fame and fortune. And one of the

27:08.997 --> 27:13.703
things he did was to start to get a collaborative 
book written about heat flow from the earth to be

27:14.527 --> 27:21.996
published by his international heat flow 
committee. And he asked me to write a summarizing

27:22.016 --> 27:24.980
chapter. And I refused to do it on the grounds that I 
couldn't be bothered to read all the manuscripts

27:25.660 --> 27:29.765
he'd got. And he wrote to me a very fierce letter in 
which he said he thought this was very

27:30.566 --> 27:34.371
unreasonable. I just must write him an article. He 
was clearly one of these people like Dick Field who

27:35.712 --> 27:38.796
wouldn't take no for an answer. So I said I would 
write him an article on the history of heat flow.

27:43.075 --> 27:51.545
This was intended originally more or less a joke, 
and I started to write a history of heat flow in the

27:43.075 --> 27:51.545
17th century. And so I wrote an article on the study 
of heat flow from the Earth in the 17th century,

27:52.406 --> 27:57.973
which is rather surprising. Boyle was interested 
in it. And then I decided to write this more

28:01.797 --> 28:07.264
seriously, and I continued it up to the present 
day. And I haven't got a copy of this here, I'm

28:07.666 --> 28:09.788
afraid. But anyway, in the middle 30s, I'd become 
interested in it. This was in the 50s sometime. I'd

28:17.955 --> 28:20.237
become interested in the thing in the 30s. Of 
course, Jeffries had pointed out how few

28:20.257 --> 28:23.220
measurements there were. And I'd put a graduate 
student onto it in about 36 or 37. And he was making

28:28.164 --> 28:34.369
measurements in England in collaboration with 
the oil companies who got some boreholes. And I did

28:35.150 --> 28:37.352
some measurements in South Africa. And so I then 
became, I became interested in the whole

28:37.838 --> 28:42.924
question, how do you measure heat flow? How, what 
sources of uncertainty are there? I became

28:46.688 --> 28:51.093
interested in the effect of the topography of the 
earth and distorting the heat flow and so on. And I

28:51.694 --> 28:57.381
then also became interested just before the war in 
the possibility of making measurements at sea.

28:57.401 --> 28:58.923
And at that time, war was on us. I didn't get 
anything done before the war. Then, after the war,

29:02.647 --> 29:07.052
I tried to get Maurice Ewing interested. And 
Morris Ewing had his own problems and couldn't

29:08.112 --> 29:10.995
give me ship time. And eventually Roger Revelle 
offered me ship time. But then when I got down here,

29:14.919 --> 29:18.863
he wouldn't give me any workshop time. I think very 
foolishly. And so Art Maxwell and I went into the

29:20.324 --> 29:26.210
workshop here and started to build the equipment. 
And I was very surprised that the workshop

29:26.230 --> 29:32.076
manager, the head mechanic, wouldn't let us into 
the store. And I thought this was very odd. It

29:35.420 --> 29:37.782
turned out afterwards that there was a racket 
going on. He was buying stores and running a shop in

29:38.335 --> 29:44.465
town and selling them again. And, of course, we 
were very liable to discover this racket, that he

29:44.505 --> 29:52.699
was taking things away in the evening, because we 
were staying much later than he was. So it must have

29:53.841 --> 29:55.464
been a grave embarrassment to him. And shortly 
after we left, this all came out.
