WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:14.098
What

00:02.866 --> 00:14.098
kind of work ethic did Aggies have? Were they lazy 
or energetic? In terms of building a bonfire? I

00:22.146 --> 00:30.375
think

00:22.146 --> 00:30.375
we didn't disregard our responsibilities. I 
mean, if you don't keep your grades up, the

00:33.055 --> 00:40.965
upperclassmen are on your back, and you had to post 
your grades on the door. And if you flunk a course,

00:41.025 --> 00:46.471
you're going to hear about it. But you also, we 
didn't have a good system like we have now, but you

00:46.552 --> 00:51.598
get some help sometimes. They'd say, Mr. 
So-and-so wants you to come down to his room. And

00:56.403 --> 01:00.328
we'd say, now, what's going on in your history 
class, or whatever it was? And they'd try to help us

01:00.950 --> 01:03.754
and things like that. When you arrived, who was the 
commandant? Bull Boatner. Describe him. He was

01:10.923 --> 01:12.085
like a bull. I had no personal relationships with 
him. About what size was he? About your build, I'd

01:18.052 --> 01:21.257
say. Five-nine? Maybe, I don't think he's any 
bigger than that, but like I said, I never, you

01:23.444 --> 01:29.151
know, I never trigon trotted. Why did y'all call 
him Bull? That was his nickname. He was a bull.

01:33.376 --> 01:35.258
That's what they're calling the trigon bulls. 
And, uh, and Guy Malloy after him. M, how, how does

01:40.925 --> 01:43.068
spell Malloy? M-E-L-L-O-Y. L-O-Y. And describe 
him. Well, he was a tall, slender type guy, and, uh,

01:47.313 --> 01:53.080
uh, he's, uh, very business-like. You didn't see 
much of them, though, at my level again, because,

01:55.418 --> 02:06.509
you know, they're taking care of the bin and the 
tri-gun, whatever. I didn't see them in the Quad

02:07.230 --> 02:08.911
very much at all. And, of course, I knew his career 
quite a bit after that, because his son was one of my

02:09.792 --> 02:22.965
students when I was an instructor at the command 
zone of South College down at Lloyd Junior. And

02:23.401 --> 02:26.425
Bill Boatner, of course, everybody knew about him 
in Korea. and when he took over Cogedo Prison. Now,

02:30.074 --> 02:32.356
he was not an Aggie, was he, Boatner? No, neither 
one of them. That's what I thought. I had General

02:36.740 --> 02:48.270
Boatner back down here one time when he was a 
viewing officer, and he wasn't, I mean, he was

02:36.740 --> 02:48.270
nice, but he didn't seem overjoyed. Describe as 
much as you can that Corps revolt and march on

02:57.421 --> 02:59.564
President Gilchrist's house. Well, of course, we 
knew that this thing was stirring, that they were

03:01.668 --> 03:21.220
going to move the fish out to Brownfield, and so I 
think it emanated from the Houston area that this

03:01.668 --> 03:21.220
is not going to happen, and it got organized that 
we're going to not put up with this, and we want the

03:01.668 --> 03:21.220
Corps to stand behind. These are former students 
that were running this thing, I think. And so one

03:24.877 --> 03:34.107
night at midnight, whistles blew and horns blow 
and everything, and we fall out, and we're

03:24.877 --> 03:34.107
marching on the President's House. I was a junior 
there. And we fall out, and the Bulls come, and the

03:36.449 --> 03:47.121
band was out there with the instruments, and the 
Bulls told the band they were not going to use those

03:36.449 --> 03:47.121
instruments. They were going to the United States 
Army, which they did. And so they grounded those

03:50.404 --> 03:53.888
and went back and got their own. A lot of them had 
their own drums or whatever. So we marched in

03:58.259 --> 04:03.806
formation over there, and not everybody in the 
Corps went. And there was some speech making by

04:03.826 --> 04:11.376
some seniors, which I couldn't hear, but I knew 
what was going on. And the seniors were pulling

04:11.396 --> 04:14.340
their diamonds off. I'm a junior, I got stripes, 
and stupidly, I give them my stripes. Never did get

04:18.627 --> 04:19.488
them back. But, you know, it's kind of all of the 
leader stuff that wasn't smart enough to know you

04:21.190 --> 04:26.717
don't do. And did President Gilchrist come out on 
the porch and hear? But I don't know what, were

04:32.445 --> 04:37.071
there shames there, but probably ordered us back 
to the dorm. We then did not, no more formations. We

04:43.075 --> 04:49.883
did go to class, we did wear the uniform, we saluted 
the officers, and the rest of the life was as usual.

04:49.923 --> 04:54.329
A bunch of the guys were going out across the state 
making speeches. Again, I didn't know much about

04:54.449 --> 04:58.934
that. We didn't like it, you know, because they 
were all our fish. So it never worked. It didn't

05:07.925 --> 05:09.707
work very well, I don't think. And the heart of the 
argument was putting the freshmen out at Bryan

05:09.940 --> 05:14.247
Field. Right. And the purpose of that was to try to 
avoid hazing. Right, try to stop the hazing. It

05:23.262 --> 05:25.105
still went on that scenario. I'm sure it's one of 
them. People went out to Bryan Field to haze them. I

05:29.111 --> 05:32.016
didn't, but I do know of people that did. And I did go 
out there on occasion. They'd use some of the guys,

05:35.395 --> 05:40.983
the doors would go out and conduct drills or 
something like that. And I did that a few times. But

05:44.227 --> 05:47.992
we just said there was no way I'd work with them four 
years later. And they wrote that in three or four

05:48.072 --> 05:50.736
years. And when they put them back in as 
sophomores, the sophomores essentially were

05:50.856 --> 05:57.244
doing what the freshmen were doing, cleaning 
rooms. Now, when all of the brass and the stripes

05:57.983 --> 06:04.989
were handed to President Gilchrist, he accepted 
them, didn't he? He sure did. He didn't give them

06:05.850 --> 06:06.710
back. I guess some people did. You had to go full 
board.

06:12.696 --> 06:21.023
So it was an unsuccessful... Well, yeah, I think 
that it was a dumb thing, of course, as you look back

06:12.696 --> 06:21.023
on it. I don't think it cost me anything in terms of 
going in the military because my grades were not

06:27.599 --> 06:29.902
sufficiently high to be a distinguished student. 
So when I went in, I went in as a reserve officer

06:30.704 --> 06:38.916
rather than a regular, and there was no prejudice 
involved in my records that I knew of. But there

06:39.316 --> 06:42.261
might have been on some of the others? Could have 
been,

06:42.521 --> 06:48.870
yes. During your four years here, were there any 
sad events here? There were no fires, No tragedies

06:57.721 --> 07:00.345
here on campus, were there? I don't remember any. 
And the Korean War starts after you graduate, so

07:02.369 --> 07:08.378
okay. I was already in there. So nothing like we had 
last week where you remember where you were when

07:09.821 --> 07:14.168
you heard the news. Do you remember going to Silver 
Taps for the first time? I remember going to it, but

07:19.237 --> 07:28.594
we already knew what you were supposed to do and so 
forth, and it was a pretty sobering event. Did

07:28.754 --> 07:30.477
everybody respect Silbertaps? Oh, sure. I mean, 
this third place was blacked out. You wouldn't

07:33.803 --> 07:36.327
dare wish for nothing. If you did, you'd pay a price 
for it. We were very serious about that. Do you

07:41.997 --> 07:44.181
remember going to Muster as a student? According 
to where? Muster, as a student. I went to, they had

07:47.174 --> 07:54.108
Muster up in front of the administration 
building, and I went to it up there. Was there an

07:54.529 --> 07:57.294
out-of-town speaker to Muster then? I don't 
remember. Usually just somebody from the campus,

07:59.217 --> 08:03.466
a football coach. And it was usually held early in 
the evening, wasn't it? Yes. on the steps of the

08:07.988 --> 08:10.652
admin building. What about yell practice? Yeah, 
plenty of those up in Goodwin Hall Tuesdays and

08:14.137 --> 08:18.844
Thursdays, I think. And then was there a midnight 
yell practice? Yes. Where was it held? It was held

08:22.830 --> 08:28.478
in various places, but I don't think we went to Kyle 
Field for them more than once or twice. And was the

08:29.015 --> 08:30.878
Grove? The Grove was operating and showing 
movies. In fact, that's where some of the old

08:34.543 --> 08:37.167
practices were. Let's see. Bonfire. Was there a 
bonfire your freshman year? Just a pile of trash.

08:46.721 --> 08:47.682
And where'd y'all get it? just went around and got 
old stuff from the iron grocery store and wood. We

08:54.351 --> 08:57.656
didn't take people's outhouses and things like 
that. About how long did y'all work on Bonfire? I

09:02.143 --> 09:05.368
don't think more than a week or two. It wasn't 
really a significant event. How did it change,

09:08.958 --> 09:12.782
bonfire, in your four student years? By the time 
you were a senior, were there using logs? A few, but

09:17.328 --> 09:18.649
nothing. There wasn't any transportation and 
chainsaws. I mean, people didn't have trucks and

09:22.674 --> 09:26.118
things like that, pickups. So it was about like a 
high school bonfire now. And it really wasn't

09:31.132 --> 09:36.500
that, to me it was not as significant an event as it 
was later when I came back. And it was held on the

09:36.800 --> 09:39.264
Driffin. Let's see, the, what was there at 
Northgate in your student days? Well, there was a

09:48.398 --> 09:58.152
drug store up there, and Pollock, and Zubik to 
Taylor, and of course Lupo. Lupo, a barber shop. I

10:03.370 --> 10:07.175
think there was one gift shop on the jewelry store 
on the corner. And

10:08.557 --> 10:14.644
I think it was right in the movie, I don't remember. 
There was one eating place there, I think. And then

10:18.528 --> 10:24.956
at South Gate was the pharmacy, the drug store. Oh, 
okay.

10:28.777 --> 10:31.100
And the railroad station was busy, wasn't it? Oh, 
yes. The college station. Right. Where was the bus

10:34.123 --> 10:35.725
stop? Where'd you catch them? I'd catch them off 
the gate.

10:42.513 --> 10:47.158
Not by the post I was pulling down, but I don't 
remember what was there. I know I used to meet my

10:47.859 --> 10:52.765
girlfriend from 2U there once in a while. And was 
the Aggieland Inn still going? About how many... I

10:58.105 --> 11:04.052
never was in it. It didn't have many rooms, I know. 
Is that right? And when did the MSC construction

11:08.076 --> 11:12.141
begin? Do you remember?

11:17.767 --> 11:21.251
It wasn't while I was a student. It wasn't finished 
when you were a student? No. It's after that? No.

11:26.056 --> 11:27.538
Okay. I was about out. I don't remember. And so the 
only place within walking distance of the campus

11:33.673 --> 11:43.314
where an out-of-town guest could spend the night. 
The dormitories. was in the dormitories or at the

11:44.984 --> 11:47.910
Aggieland Inn. Well, there was a motel over at the 
North Gate, I mean the East Gate. Yeah, yeah, but

11:54.504 --> 11:57.590
that would be a long walk. Or there were some that, 
you know, the profs boarded some of the doors, but

11:57.610 --> 12:05.406
usually they dumped out of dormitories. As you and 
your buddies looked at the campus leaders, what

12:06.871 --> 12:17.565
was the most respected campus leadership 
position?

12:20.428 --> 12:24.714
Oh, we didn't look up to the Corps commander by any 
means. He was too far away from us. But that was the

12:28.178 --> 12:30.822
most glamorous student leadership role, wasn't 
it? Oh, yeah, but the company commander was the one

12:30.842 --> 12:36.709
that was the most influence on us. As far as you all 
knew, how was the Corps commander selected? I had

12:42.332 --> 12:43.233
no idea. I figured, well, for one thing, they had to 
be on the contract. I know that for sure because I'm

12:48.561 --> 12:58.775
the guy that changed the commander not having a 
contract because I remembered I didn't have a

12:48.561 --> 12:58.775
contract and I felt like I was as good as any other. 
But the Army, the military was wrong about that, I

12:59.656 --> 13:04.583
still think they were wrong. As far as you knew, how 
was the outfit the company commander selected?

13:11.871 --> 13:12.451
How was he run? How was he selected? He was first 
sergeant. He didn't move up. But how did he become a

13:18.159 --> 13:21.663
first sergeant? I presume that the class selected 
and the sophomores select who in their group they

13:22.144 --> 13:28.051
want to be the first sergeant. That's the way it was 
when I was in the company of the battering. And what

13:33.418 --> 13:35.721
did you and your buddies think about yell leaders? 
Well, we didn't think them bad of them. We thought

13:40.599 --> 13:41.962
they were pretty big wheels. It's a pretty, pretty 
big job. One of the guys really liked to have the

13:47.573 --> 13:49.938
day, too. And what about the band? Well, we loved 
the band, but we didn't love them as a unit. My

13:58.972 --> 14:08.066
senior year, my battery was on the bottom floor of 
the band dorm, and we didn't have a lovely fire with

13:58.972 --> 14:08.066
the band. They were on two, three, and four, and 
they didn't want us in that dorm. Were the band,

14:12.742 --> 14:16.046
were they noisy? Were they what? Were they noisy? 
Oh, yeah, sure. They were bothersome to you guys?

14:21.312 --> 14:22.113
Yeah, you bet. They harass us. Were there any 
pranks back and forth? Not particularly. We

14:27.921 --> 14:34.869
didn't, once in a while somebody's room would get 
drowned out, but I think that was a personal type

14:27.921 --> 14:34.869
thing. It only happened to me one time while we were 
gone. My roommate was first sergeant, and he was

14:39.254 --> 14:42.158
pretty tough on them. And we came back and 
everything we owned was in the floor, and flooded

14:44.243 --> 14:49.788
out. And, you know, I didn't do anything, but I 
didn't, you know, after it set me back big in

14:49.808 --> 14:58.816
Rwanda, believe me, they don't think about that. 
Did you and your buddies know about steam tunnels

15:00.237 --> 15:04.040
when you were a student? No. Did you ever go down in 
them? Yeah. How far did you? Just far enough to get

15:08.524 --> 15:12.027
down there and know I didn't want to be down there 
and got out. As far as you know, from whatever

15:12.732 --> 15:22.368
source, how far in that era, how far could somebody 
have gone in a steam tunnel? I'm told you could get

15:23.390 --> 15:25.213
as far as the library. Is that right? But I don't 
know that for a fact. I do know a couple of guys that

15:28.638 --> 15:34.788
were tunnel rats, you know, and that was what they 
were known as in the course. I don't know what they

15:35.670 --> 15:37.052
did down there. And wasn't there a way supposedly 
to turn off the water and turn on the water? Well,

15:45.107 --> 15:51.253
see, there was supposedly a secret organization 
going around at the time, the T's or something like

15:45.107 --> 15:51.253
that. The T.T.'s? T.T.' 's, and I don't know 
whether they were involved with that or not. I

15:54.757 --> 15:58.621
didn't, I knew that there was something like that, 
but that's all I knew. Because I know old Bob, we

15:58.641 --> 16:05.267
used to work for Colas before I died there. Anyway, 
he was trying to track it down, but I don't think he

16:07.171 --> 16:12.075
ever found it. Were you aware of any other, did you 
ever hear of any other secret fraternity here? The

16:17.801 --> 16:18.321
Stickers? The Swastikers?

16:23.586 --> 16:33.375
Now, during your student days, these veterans 
came back and there were big, big veterans housing

16:23.586 --> 16:33.375
all over. How did A&M change during your 
sophomore, junior, senior year with all those

16:37.208 --> 16:45.156
veterans and those young brides and their kids? I 
really don't think that there was any animosity or

16:45.657 --> 16:50.382
anything. I think most Aggies were proud of all 
these guys that, you know, did what they did. And I

16:56.028 --> 16:59.812
think most of them are proud that some of these guys 
will never be able to see a college. Reckon it,

17:00.893 --> 17:03.535
reckon the grades went up? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you had 
to, there's no question, competition I know I

17:07.398 --> 17:16.319
worked harder because you could pretty much come 
by before the vets came by. And the project houses

17:17.401 --> 17:19.667
were still down there. They were still in use. Now, 
you gradually changed your major. When did you

17:26.409 --> 17:30.274
zero in on ag education? No, I was on just straight 
education. Oh, education. That was my junior

17:34.619 --> 17:36.501
year. And you had gotten advice from Dr. 
Harrington. Who else gave you advice?

17:44.692 --> 17:50.178
I really didn't have any close contact with 
anybody after Dr. Harrington. And when did you go

17:50.198 --> 17:51.580
to summer camp? summer

17:52.724 --> 17:56.770
of, uh, 48. After your... Well, see, I didn't have a 
contract until after my junior year. I had to have a

18:02.759 --> 18:04.341
contract. So, uh, I was behind my classmates. I 
went with the class behind me. And where did you go

18:08.548 --> 18:10.210
to summer camp? Fort Sells. What was it like? Well, 
you know, it was dark soup compared to being at it.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.242
We had We had Aggie companies and OU had Oklahoma 
companies and we competed with each other and got

18:18.509 --> 18:27.961
along great. And of course we liked it because 
everybody there was in the artillery business and

18:29.262 --> 18:38.253
so forth, but Fort Sells had a good program back 
then. Did, in hindsight, did that experience help

18:38.914 --> 18:46.744
to make the active duty service more attractive to 
you? I tell you, if there wasn't anything they

18:47.365 --> 19:00.862
could have done, it wouldn't have helped them, 
because I was very, very motivated towards it, and

18:47.365 --> 19:00.862
also because of some family members that were in 
the service during the war. The patriotism was

19:02.484 --> 19:05.808
pretty high.

19:07.630 --> 19:08.952
Let's see. We were talking a while ago about 
drinking and so forth. What about smoking? What

19:14.840 --> 19:16.421
did Aggies smoke in those days? Well, a lot of them 
did. Cigarettes. What brands? I don't know. I

19:21.987 --> 19:24.249
never smoked, and so I don't know. Do you have a 
guess as to how many Aggies smoked? Percentage?

19:28.273 --> 19:28.574
Half? Did they smoke in the dormitories? Was it 
legal for them to smoke in their room? As far as I

19:37.843 --> 19:39.765
know, it was not in their rooms. And did Aggie smoke 
cigars except at games? No, I think it was strictly

19:45.121 --> 19:48.306
a Yale practice type thing. What about pipes? 
Rare. Chewing tobacco? Not like today. Snuff?

19:58.258 --> 19:58.959
Nothing. They probably went on in like the Cavs 
outfits and so forth. They didn't go in the

20:02.144 --> 20:03.846
artillery outfits. I don't know what the 
difference is. Did you and your buddies even know

20:05.868 --> 20:08.672
the words marijuana or heroin?

20:13.478 --> 20:16.442
I had no interest in drugs. Yeah, I thought those 
were non-existent.

20:23.090 --> 20:27.175
Let's see, and you said you went, you didn't go to 
downtown Bryan very often. No. I went on the

20:29.197 --> 20:30.920
trolley car when I did. Do you remember what it 
cost? Ten cents. Ten cents. And caught it at

20:35.705 --> 20:37.107
Northgate? at the North Gate and got off in 
downtown Brown. There was a restaurant down there

20:39.945 --> 20:45.634
where people used to go and eat, kind of a cafeteria 
type place. And it ran about how often? I think it

20:48.559 --> 20:52.045
was about every 30 minutes, but I don't know. I 
didn't, like I said, I didn't eat it very often. And

20:54.389 --> 20:58.175
you picked up your mail at North Gate? At George's, 
I think. There was a mailbox down there about where

20:59.657 --> 21:03.664
the trigon is. Oh, okay. a little cafeteria type 
thing over there. See, we did silver tabs, muster,

21:10.833 --> 21:13.976
yell practice.

21:19.443 --> 21:21.205
How much did your senior ring cost? Do you 
remember? I think it was just about the same thing

21:23.708 --> 21:31.056
as the monthly pay of the contract, $28, $29. And 
how did you feel when you put that ring on the first

21:31.812 --> 21:34.996
time? Like I feel today. I'm thinking of getting me 
another one. This is my second one. Do you have any

21:43.448 --> 21:54.303
good ring stories where somebody recognized it 
somewhere on the other side of the world or you lost

21:43.448 --> 21:54.303
it and it came back or anything like that? No, 
except that I'm always looking at somebody's hand

21:54.643 --> 22:00.992
and particularly I go to Barksdale a good bit, and 
Aggies are all over the place up there, and I belong

22:01.580 --> 22:09.837
to that club up there too. So you make friends, and 
you see them, and it don't take but a minute to be

22:11.019 --> 22:16.109
telling lies together. But I don't know anybody 
that had her brain recovered. I read these stories

22:20.899 --> 22:22.963
in Aggie and so forth. My only ring story is the one 
in the Cal display over there was Judy's ring that

22:23.483 --> 22:31.194
died. And that was my first ring. And Ed was in, you 
know, pregnant assistant. Ed Cooper. Ed Cooper

22:45.835 --> 22:51.263
was working on some project over there on former 
students, and I was talking about you know,

22:51.935 --> 22:54.478
getting her a ring, and she wanted a big one. And I 
said, Ed, you know, would Balfour do anything with

22:55.219 --> 23:00.064
this old ring of mine? He said, I don't know, but I 
found out. Well, he took my original ring and cut

23:01.346 --> 23:06.592
this crest off and put her class year on there. And 
that's my original ring with her class year on it.

23:10.236 --> 23:10.557
Oh, hell no. In that case. And Balfour said they 
won't do any more like that. So that is an original.

23:16.804 --> 23:19.047
So the ring you're wearing now is your second. 
Second ring. And because I was really proud of

23:21.010 --> 23:30.605
Judy, and she had never had a chance to go to school. 
And your boots, where'd you buy those? Hollock.

23:35.072 --> 23:36.094
You remember what they cost? I'm sorry? How much 
did they cost? $100. Where'd you get that? Saved up

23:40.481 --> 23:41.443
for it. You had saved up from your, and how did you 
feel when you put those on? You know, just like

23:45.930 --> 23:48.013
putting it around. And where are they now? I sold 
them to a guy that was in the band named T.A.

23:53.146 --> 23:58.855
Carlton, and I don't know where he is now, but I sold 
them for 70 bucks. And we didn't wear our boots like

24:00.898 --> 24:02.701
they do now. We only wore them on special 
occasions. Now they wear them all the time. And so

24:06.847 --> 24:14.018
was your first time to wear them publicly at Final 
Review your junior year? And did anyone in your

24:15.145 --> 24:18.710
family come for that? My mother and daddy. And how 
did you feel, and how did they feel? They were

24:23.417 --> 24:26.542
proud. And was there any distinguished visitor 
that day, any famous? I don't remember any. We just

24:35.255 --> 24:39.701
didn't, I don't remember a whole lot of them, you 
know, with the reviewing stand or anything like

24:35.255 --> 24:39.701
that. Most of the time going to a choral review 
wasn't much fun. Now, let's see. During your days,

24:46.301 --> 24:50.767
didn't Patton or Eisenhower come to visit once or 
twice? Not that I recall. They might have. Then

24:55.975 --> 25:02.043
when you were a senior, describe final review and 
commencement. Well, first of all, my class did not

25:03.946 --> 25:08.212
have a commencement. We graduated the real 
beginning, the ones that began. Some of them

25:12.317 --> 25:13.519
graduated in ahead of time, but the main part of the 
class graduated in January of 49, and we voted not

25:14.073 --> 25:23.885
to have a ceremony. We had a commissioning 
ceremony in Dine Hall, and that was it. We didn't

25:28.911 --> 25:34.218
want it really, but because it was a hassle, we 
wanted to get our commissioning and get on the way.

25:35.139 --> 25:36.501
So we didn't have a commission. So you graduated in 
January of 49? 49. January 19. And went on active

25:42.548 --> 25:43.810
duty? First of March. First of March. As you look 
back on it, what is it that creates this special

25:46.647 --> 25:55.259
Aggie spirit? Why are Aggies so proud? I think it's 
maybe because we're having an interest in each

25:58.864 --> 26:09.680
other, and we're sticking together, and that's 
just kind of bred into you when you're a fish. And if

26:09.700 --> 26:12.784
you don't stick together, you'll never make it. 
So, you know, even today, fish buddies will sell

26:13.338 --> 26:17.162
you fish buddies. Are there some events that 
encourage that sticking together? I don't think

26:23.148 --> 26:28.193
any more than the living in the dormitory 
lifestyle. But do silver taps and muster and yelp?

26:34.019 --> 26:42.568
I think, you know, the guys that are RVs probably 
have, they're melded, and the guys are in the

26:34.019 --> 26:42.568
cowlower, and that sort of thing. You know, they 
have a loyalty to the outfit, but also have that to

26:42.987 --> 26:48.073
the activity. Fish-grilling people, for 
example, are very tight, and that

26:49.135 --> 27:01.070
was my mistake on that. And I should have never let 
the Marines have that. I'm not putting the Marines

27:04.454 --> 27:10.041
down, but they have a different attitude.

27:10.510 --> 27:11.572
No, I don't know. That never occurred to me. The 
whole Aggies didn't feel like I felt.

27:21.167 --> 27:23.811
I know my brother doesn't feel as strong as I do. He 
does now, but he didn't now.

27:31.543 --> 27:38.914
Looking back on it, what did you learn at A&M that 
has been important to you in your life? Well, I

27:40.295 --> 27:44.241
think a lot of things I've already learned. I don't 
lie to anybody. I don't steal. I wouldn't think of

27:48.126 --> 27:49.027
it. And I can't tolerate drug uses and such as that. 
And I went through a lot of it with my own kids. And I

27:55.957 --> 28:08.715
think just standing by each other is really what I 
learned about the Corps, that these are the guys

27:55.957 --> 28:08.715
you can count on.

28:14.028 --> 28:19.575
And through the years, how has that helped you? How 
has this A&M experience helped you? Well, it

28:24.761 --> 28:34.673
certainly opened a lot of doors in the Army, and 
just like the west runners, you know, they help

28:24.761 --> 28:34.673
each other. You see an Aggie, and he assumes that 
you're you're going to be a good officer and you can

28:38.092 --> 28:41.496
count on him. And I don't know that you can 
differentiate between him and some other

28:42.297 --> 28:50.267
officer, but the others may have to prove 
themselves. That Aggie's already proved

28:50.307 --> 28:53.371
himself. I didn't ever seek any employment or, you 
know, being an Aggie got me a job out there because I

28:53.391 --> 29:01.220
never worked in a civilian market. If, make 
believe that we have just hired you to be the

29:03.242 --> 29:07.828
consultant to A&M's leaders, and you're to advise 
A&M's leaders about what they should do in the

29:09.243 --> 29:19.197
future for this school. What advice would you give 
A&M's leaders today? Well, for one thing, I don't

29:24.184 --> 29:30.934
think I'd tell them we've got to cut the, we can't 
continue to grow that everything. I think it's

29:31.735 --> 29:37.984
getting to the point that I don't enjoy coming back 
like I used to. I mean, I'm just talking short years

29:38.943 --> 29:41.366
ago. But the kids are still the best kids in the 
world. But I think that they get more rambunctious

29:47.293 --> 29:56.203
than they used to be. I think a lot of things go on, 
and I don't know how the administration can

29:56.423 --> 30:02.470
control that. this off-campus type lifestyle, 
just living together and so forth. It's tough. It

30:13.261 --> 30:14.863
goes under dormitories, too. And I thought it like 
hell when I was coming out, but I knew we was going to

30:14.883 --> 30:20.110
have trouble with it. And there was a fair amount of 
it that I had to take action on. So I don't know.

30:30.945 --> 30:32.507
Academically, Goodness knows they're doing the 
one thing I always hoped to do at a medical college.

30:39.377 --> 30:43.002
And I think we're very strong in the arts. I used to 
be an engineer, and to me, I'm not artistic in any

30:43.022 --> 30:52.136
manner, but my leaning has always been in that 
direction. And I'm glad to see it, and I'm proud of

30:53.417 --> 30:57.904
the College of Education.

31:00.179 --> 31:13.902
And I get sometimes weary of coming back to the 
campus, because if you don't bring your checkbook

31:00.179 --> 31:13.902
with you sometimes, you know, sometimes they 
overdo that.
