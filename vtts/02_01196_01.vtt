00:03.997 --> 00:04.618
It's hard. The other thing, and I know you've run 
out of time. And you've answered this also, in a

00:07.561 --> 00:14.390
way.

00:14.410 --> 00:22.440
Please put yourself in George Mitchell's mind and 
tell us why he keeps you around. What is it you do for

00:22.460 --> 00:25.904
him? Why is he attracted to you?

00:31.371 --> 00:32.232
What role? Do you play for him, in terms of what's 
going

00:32.667 --> 00:47.003
on with him? What goes on in his mind is a very good 
question.

00:53.711 --> 01:00.058
I think part of his attraction to me is I am an 
academic. My background, I have a PhD from the

01:01.884 --> 01:10.455
University of Chicago, and I think that's 
impressive. Two, there have been several

01:10.475 --> 01:28.898
occasions where things,

01:10.475 --> 01:28.898
where potentially very embarrassing things 
occurred, and he was able to call upon me. I

01:29.688 --> 01:48.189
think that he, and I think also that

01:29.688 --> 01:48.189
he thinks that I add a dimension that is important 
to the Wimbledon Corporation. That because of my

01:48.209 --> 01:54.717
background and my interests, and the fact that I'm 
not part of You know, I'm not here with my eye on

01:55.861 --> 02:01.549
becoming the president of the Women's 
Corporation or doing Mike Richman's job. And I

02:02.030 --> 02:05.334
don't know anything about energy and I care less 
about real estate. I'm not... So you're a detached

02:07.177 --> 02:10.702
observer and a participant? Well, yeah. And, you 
know, I take care of that and I take care of this and I

02:11.543 --> 02:16.030
take care of that. And I guess that's...

02:21.317 --> 02:23.961
I don't know any other reason really. But he has, he 
surrounds himself with a lot of people like that.

02:26.948 --> 02:28.650
And that seems to be one of his unique talents. You 
know, the diversity of people in this community

02:28.670 --> 02:33.414
area is really interesting. Yeah. Because it is 
very unusual. And they are really diverse and are

02:35.856 --> 02:38.919
alike quite often. I try to explain to people, they 
say, well, why don't you call it a research park?

02:44.584 --> 02:48.147
Why don't you call it a research forest or an 
industrial park? And the point is, there isn't

02:48.587 --> 02:51.570
anything else like it in the country. Yeah. I mean, 
aside from the fact there's venture capital, the

02:54.282 --> 02:59.889
ability to invest in some of these companies. This 
whole community, in a sense, is dedicated to

02:59.909 --> 03:08.961
maximizing the success of companies in that 
bio-med and bio-tech. You know, there are good

03:08.981 --> 03:11.504
schools here. The scientists can jump on their 
bike. If they want to come out at 2 o'clock in the

03:14.428 --> 03:17.212
morning, they can. And we're able to offer a total 
package. We've got a Japanese company that's

03:21.316 --> 03:23.419
interested. And they said, well, what would it 
take? And they said, look, education is very

03:26.504 --> 03:31.332
important to us. We know you have good schools, but 
our kids go to the Japanese Juku Saturday school,

03:31.392 --> 03:37.782
supplementary school. Well, that's way over in 
West Houston. But we wanted very much for that

03:41.929 --> 03:44.493
company to be here. So we proposed very simply, 
we'll provide a van Saturday morning. We'll take

03:49.328 --> 03:50.711
the kids and bring them back. And once we get a 
nucleus, we'll start our own supplementary

03:50.791 --> 03:53.376
school. They're not in a lot of places. No, we don't 
respond like that. So anyway, I hope this has been

04:01.072 --> 04:03.276
helpful. That's been very useful. Yeah, I 
appreciate it all.
