WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:05.116
Dr. and General Butler, today is July 24, 1980. 
This is Terry Anderson. We were talking last time

00:07.039 --> 00:10.545
about the committee. And it was Ted Noyes. Yes. 
Archie Flowers in the Department of Veterinary

00:16.875 --> 00:24.768
Public Health was chairman of the committee. Ted 
Noyes, N-O-Y-E-S. and I were the ones that studied

00:27.757 --> 00:37.689
the compulsory ROTC and the COED matter as a 
committee appointed by then President Rutter.

00:39.672 --> 00:43.917
OK, we're going to talk about your relations with 
General Rutter later. Let's get back to where we

00:44.057 --> 00:45.840
left off. Last time, we were talking about the 
Highway Information Service in the 1930s. And you

00:51.847 --> 00:56.633
said that the corpsman, well, could you explain 
how that worked? Well,

00:58.452 --> 01:17.017
about 1936 or 1937, the highway information 
stations were established at the main highway

00:58.452 --> 01:17.017
entrances to Texas. The Civil Engineering 
Department of Texas A&M

01:18.739 --> 01:28.392
had a close connection with the Texas Highway 
Department. and I don't know exactly how it came

01:30.143 --> 01:43.462
about, but the highway information stations 
first were opened just in the summertime when the

01:30.143 --> 01:43.462
peak tourist load was experienced. They were 
manned just in the summer and they were manned by

01:43.482 --> 01:49.450
Texas A&M University cadets in uniform. That went 
along for several years. I was assigned one year,

01:54.017 --> 01:59.965
let's see, between my sophomore and junior year, 
so it would have been 1937 to the highway

02:02.037 --> 02:16.719
information station at Marshall, Texas on 
highway 80 coming in from the east Louisiana side.

02:19.403 --> 02:30.660
So I was proud at that time the uniforms were 
different for the first two-year cadets and for

02:19.403 --> 02:30.660
those that were juniors and seniors and really The 
ones selected were juniors and seniors. They were

02:36.634 --> 02:46.349
able to wear suede uniforms, whereas the first 
two-year cadets wore just issue wool uniforms. So

02:46.369 --> 02:59.989
the uniforms worn by the juniors and seniors were a 
good deal dressier than the issue clothing, wool

02:46.369 --> 02:59.989
clothing, that the first two-year cadets wore. So 
after you'd completed your sophomore year, you

03:01.842 --> 03:23.993
were eligible to buy the suede clothing, so I was 
pleased to be able to wear that,

03:01.842 --> 03:23.993
dressier shirts, herringbone twill for the 
khaki, and for the wool summer, I mean winter

03:01.842 --> 03:23.993
uniform, of course, suede. I would think that the 
wool would be awesome. Well, it wasn't important.

03:30.443 --> 03:40.777
In the summer, you see, we wore the HBT's, the 
Herringbone Twill, when we manned that station.

03:40.797 --> 03:44.542
The Corps is a whole lot better dressed now. They do 
get issue uniforms and they're all the same. You

03:48.927 --> 03:53.213
see, in our days, there was a good deal of 
distinction freshman wore a white stripe around

03:54.948 --> 04:02.618
their left sleeve down near the cuff, a fish 
stripe, you know. So you didn't have any trouble

04:03.879 --> 04:06.803
identifying a freshman. And then the sophomores 
had the same sort of issue, clothing without the

04:08.125 --> 04:21.462
stripe, and the juniors then wore the dressier

04:23.838 --> 04:53.338
clothing but they had to purchase it see that 
wasn't issued by the government in those days and

04:23.838 --> 04:53.338
of course they were identified by 
non-commissioned officer stripes and the

04:23.838 --> 04:53.338
seniors see all had buttons that indicated rank 
from first lieutenant up through cadet colonel so

04:23.838 --> 04:53.338
there's a lot more distinction and of course the 
seniors also we were all wearing the campaign hats

04:54.753 --> 05:00.660
later came back into style for grill sergeants and 
all, but we all had them then. Why did this change

05:00.680 --> 05:02.642
and when did it? Well, the pressure of 
manufacturing a lot more clothing for the Army

05:04.144 --> 05:19.461
when they made the real sharp expansion in the late 
30s and early 40s, that campaign had was an

05:19.897 --> 05:30.911
expensive piece of clothing that wasn't really 
very suitable for combat duty or hard duty in the

05:19.897 --> 05:30.911
field, so it fell by the wayside. It really came on 
early for horse-drawn artillery and for cavalry

05:32.993 --> 05:44.227
troops, you see, and of course they eliminated the 
horses. In about 1941, So there wasn't really any

05:48.044 --> 05:50.147
very good excuse. Of course, the boots that are 
still worn by our senior cadets, you see, were once

05:52.110 --> 05:59.921
part of the official military uniform, too, with 
the horses. They fell out of the official uniform

06:00.662 --> 06:13.420
status in the early 40s, but thank goodness 
they've been retained by Texas A&M senior cadets.

06:13.700 --> 06:17.325
That's always been a senior privilege for these 
boots. What about the strike for that freshman? I

06:20.982 --> 06:22.684
don't know when that disappeared. I was surprised 
when I came back and really never have really

06:23.164 --> 06:34.338
learned how to distinguish between first and 
second year cadets. Now, because their uniforms

06:35.780 --> 06:46.873
look just alike, I'm sure that it was a part of the 
elimination of the hazing and upgrading the

06:35.780 --> 06:46.873
status of the freshman student. Because during 
the middle 40s, late 30s, Texas A&M

06:48.845 --> 07:14.413
was not all that popular, and particularly when 
the public sort of, after World War II, the stature

06:48.845 --> 07:14.413
of the serviceman decreased and ROTC wasn't as 
popular. Texas A&M was doing whatever it could to

07:14.984 --> 07:19.451
increase its attractiveness.

07:21.735 --> 07:32.033
Very ironical, I told somebody that for the first 
30 years of my association with Texas A&M, I was

07:21.735 --> 07:32.033
continually trying to recruit students to come to 
A&M. Then about four years ago, I got put on a

07:33.936 --> 07:38.503
committee to see how we could turn it off. Texas A&M 
got popular all of a sudden.

07:47.705 --> 07:51.008
Are you trying to do that right now? Decrease the 
growth?

07:55.473 --> 08:00.978
Well,

07:55.473 --> 08:00.978
I'd have to say yes to some degree. That is, the 
policy of the university is not to encourage

08:01.078 --> 08:12.249
out-of-state students or international 
students quite as much. The differential in

08:15.785 --> 08:18.328
Registration fees have been increased. There is

08:20.490 --> 08:40.190
less likelihood of somebody applying on an 
international basis or from out of state for there

08:20.490 --> 08:40.190
to be waivers on any of the admission requirements 
than there would be in state.

08:40.210 --> 08:43.513
The probation status is tougher. The deans are 
more likely to dismiss students that fail to make

08:44.118 --> 08:54.391
their probation status than they were. So there 
were a number of measures that were not real

08:57.054 --> 09:09.990
drastic, but a number of measures taken to slow 
down the rate of growth a little bit until we could

08:57.054 --> 09:09.990
catch up in physical facilities where their needs 
were. for faculty and for facilities to support

09:10.949 --> 09:14.813
the student body. Let's talk about your military 
career.

09:21.982 --> 09:26.587
1942, you went with the 12th Artillery. Can you 
tell me about that? Yes, 12th Field Artillery

09:29.470 --> 09:36.298
Battalion was a 155 millimeter

09:38.287 --> 09:43.953
General Support Battalion of the 2nd Infantry 
Division stationed at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

09:47.117 --> 09:58.550
I was somewhat familiar with that organization 
because Battery C of the 12th Field Artillery

09:47.117 --> 09:58.550
Battalion was the one that supported our ROTC camp 
at Camp Willis, Texas in 1938. The 2nd

09:58.570 --> 10:06.319
Infantry Division was one that distinguished 
itself in World War I. It had been stationed at Fort

10:11.057 --> 10:18.126
Sam Houston, Texas

10:11.057 --> 10:18.126
since World War I. In fact, the post was really 
built for an infantry division and the Camp

10:18.326 --> 10:35.226
Bullis, something over 20,000 acres, was a 
maneuver ground and the artillery range for that

10:35.645 --> 10:36.606
division. Over the years when the military was 
somewhat de-emphasized, we'd have to say that the

10:39.029 --> 10:49.460
2nd Infantry Division lost quite a bit of its 
combat readiness. It was a kind of a parade ground

10:50.000 --> 10:52.623
division. When was this? Well, I'd say it was a 
gradual decline in combat readiness from the 20s

10:55.386 --> 11:03.795
right up to the mid-30s.

11:06.273 --> 11:10.258
when there was not perceived to be a major 
international threat. It

11:10.438 --> 11:35.487
was one of the old line divisions around, however, 
and with the rapid expansion of the Army in the

11:10.438 --> 11:35.487
early 40s, three different cadres were taken from 
the 2nd Infantry Division to start new divisions

11:10.438 --> 11:35.487
around. And the division, of course, as all of the 
divisions, entered into a much more rigorous

11:37.019 --> 11:45.451
training program.

11:48.675 --> 11:53.902
And the honeymoon was over on being a part of the 
military. When I first went in, in August of 41, the

11:54.163 --> 12:04.377
military had a fairly relaxed training schedule. 
Wednesday afternoon and off, no Saturday drill.

12:09.569 --> 12:16.498
But after Pearl Harbor, of course, all that was 
dropped and training became much more rigorous.

12:18.460 --> 12:23.927
It was obvious that there would be a combat mission 
for the 2nd Infantry Division. So they engaged in

12:23.947 --> 12:32.558
tougher physical conditioning, military 
training the first week. still were firing our

12:32.875 --> 12:36.218
artillery on the range at Camp Willis.

12:39.461 --> 12:40.803
How many men were in the division? About 15,000 
men. The combat division now had been reduced

12:45.688 --> 12:51.633
somewhat from the size of the divisions then. But 
at full strength it was 15,000? About 15,000 men at

12:53.675 --> 12:55.917
full strength. And how many people did you have in 
the battalion, the 12th Artillery, how many men?

13:02.390 --> 13:12.504
Let's see, there were five batteries,

13:02.390 --> 13:12.504
a headquarters battery, a service battery, and 
three firing batteries. I don't know exactly, but

13:13.745 --> 13:15.988
about 600 men. How many pieces of artillery? Well 
in those days, the early days, there were four

13:19.393 --> 13:26.102
howitzers per firing battery. That was later 
increased to six surgical firing batteries,

13:26.842 --> 13:33.371
increased firepower of the artillery 
battalions. It was during that time that

13:34.593 --> 13:44.508
divisions were being mechanized and the 
triangular division concept was just being put

13:34.593 --> 13:44.508
into effect. That is- Can you explain that? Well, 
yes, the triangular division concept concept was

13:52.913 --> 14:21.250
that there would be three major fighting units 
infantry regiment with all those four troops with

13:52.913 --> 14:21.250
the concept being that the usual commitment 
normal commitment would be two frontline

13:52.913 --> 14:21.250
regiments fighting and one in reserve so that is 
the way we went into world war ii and each infantry

13:52.913 --> 14:21.250
regiment later if they They got to be called some 
other things, but the concept was an infantry

14:21.584 --> 14:37.104
regiment supported by its artillery, its 
engineers, its direct support troops, plus then

14:21.584 --> 14:37.104
some division troops. So each regiment had its 
own, each battle group or regimental group had its

14:37.224 --> 14:46.475
own artillery battalion assigned for direct 
support. Then there was a medium artillery, like

14:49.613 --> 14:56.823
the 12th Field Artillery, the direct support were 
105 millimeter howitzers. The general support

14:57.364 --> 15:04.054
was a 155 millimeter howitzer. What's the range on 
these howitzers? Well, when we, when I first went

15:08.239 --> 15:19.215
in the Army, we had the old box trail Snyder, French 
designed howitzer that wouldn't fire but about

15:08.239 --> 15:19.215
10,000 yards. But the M-1 hodgers, split trail, 
came on before World War II and they would fire

15:22.445 --> 15:40.165
about 50% increase in range, 15,000-16,000 yards 
with much more accuracy and much more rapid fire

15:22.445 --> 15:40.165
capability. They were a tremendous improvement 
over the old box trail Snyder hodgers.

15:50.347 --> 15:59.755
And the 105 Hotcher replaced what previously had 
been the 75 millimeter Hotcher, which again was a

15:50.347 --> 15:59.755
French Hotcher. And that's the one we trained on, 
the 75 millimeter, as ROTC cadets. So the 105

16:06.561 --> 16:14.348
millimeter American manufactured Hotcher just 
came into the arsenal just before World War II

16:06.561 --> 16:14.348
also. Was it a great improvement? Oh, it was a 
tremendous, tremendous improvement. Not

16:19.844 --> 16:26.050
because it had more range, but what are the other 
reasons? Well, the principal reason is it had much

16:26.070 --> 16:33.918
greater traverse without shifting the trails. So 
a gun crew could make a much more rapid response to a

16:34.298 --> 16:41.846
fire request. And it had simplified sights. The 
French howitzers were very complex in their sight

16:49.409 --> 16:53.215
adjustments. They had the French system, which 
was a plateau and drum. The ROTC cadets, you had to

17:00.686 --> 17:17.813
pick a pretty bright guy on the gun crew to handle 
the gunner role, because you had to be able to savvy

17:00.686 --> 17:17.813
that plateau and drum setting. So you had to set two 
different mechanisms on the sites and the advance

17:18.046 --> 17:27.256
was just one sighting mechanism, vastly 
simplified. And then the centralized fire

17:28.878 --> 17:40.010
direction and massing of fire techniques made 
possible by these new weapons were great factors

17:28.878 --> 17:40.010
in World War II. The Russians and even the British 
never really mastered the massing of fire

17:43.561 --> 17:51.832
techniques that we had as an artillery tactic. Why 
didn't they, if we had this technology? I don't

17:56.639 --> 17:59.583
know, it just wasn't a part of their tactics. The 
Germans tended to use more isolated weapons, some

17:59.763 --> 18:11.779
direct fire with their 88s, and these were 
awesome.

18:12.248 --> 18:25.829
But they never had the centralized fire control 
where they could mass fire a lot of battalions on

18:12.248 --> 18:25.829
one target that deserved that much attention. So 
the Americans had a big artillery advantage that

18:25.849 --> 18:30.135
way. However, the Germans were, I'd have to say, 
just as good or maybe better in anti-tank fire and

18:30.516 --> 18:38.408
direct fire kind of weapons.

18:44.227 --> 18:50.596
Proximity fuse was another development that 
really, that was a surprise. We sprung on them at

18:50.677 --> 19:02.855
Christmas time in 1944

18:50.677 --> 19:02.855
because the time fire or air burst were difficult 
to adjust. But with the sonar based fuse on a

19:04.657 --> 19:11.247
proximity fuse you didn't have to set those at all. 
just fire and they'd burst a certain distance

19:13.437 --> 19:18.204
above the ground because of the sonar. That was a 
big advance. Though their safety factor wasn't

19:22.111 --> 19:25.876
real good. Occasionally you'd get early bursts on 
those. They weren't quite as safe as the previous

19:30.664 --> 19:33.288
time fuses. And radar too.

19:39.838 --> 19:40.339
That's right. So it burst, maybe they'd burst on 
trees or maybe in rainstorms or other things that

19:41.197 --> 19:47.885
would reflect sound. Really? Oh yeah, so they 
weren't as generally usable and as reliable as a

19:48.886 --> 19:57.355
regular time fuse. They've been perfected since 
then. Oh yeah, quite a lot. Well let's get back to

20:01.020 --> 20:04.884
your duties and functions in the 12th Artillery 
Battalion. When you started off in April of 1942,

20:10.205 --> 20:11.427
What was your assignment? I was a reconnaissance 
officer.

20:19.599 --> 20:30.635
That means,

20:19.599 --> 20:30.635
you see there was a battery commander and then an 
executive officer, a reconnaissance officer and

20:19.599 --> 20:30.635
a supply officer. There were four officers in the 
battery and the reconnaissance officer's duty

20:30.675 --> 20:39.047
was to

20:30.675 --> 20:39.047
establish contact with the supported units, 
which in our cases frequently were the light

20:39.550 --> 20:47.419
artillery battalions. We'd be assigned to 
reinforce their fires. We would establish

20:51.523 --> 21:02.996
observation posts, establish a necessary 
survey, and do fire direction or fire adjustment

20:51.523 --> 21:02.996
on observed fire missions. Well that was 
Reconnaissance Officer duty. And how many men did

21:07.701 --> 21:09.523
you have under your command? Oh gosh, it would be a 
relatively small section in the reconnaissance

21:10.921 --> 21:18.470
officer section, probably about 12 or 15.

21:21.173 --> 21:25.759
How about field artillery school where you went 
after that? What'd you learn there? Well that's

21:29.103 --> 21:30.445
very ironical. I didn't go to artillery school 
until after the war. I was here October 22nd, 1942

21:34.647 --> 21:39.612
to the 13th of January, 43. Oh yeah, of course. 
Field Artillery School. Oh that basic, that was a

21:41.894 --> 21:47.179
basic officer's course, I did stand corrected on 
that. I went to the basic artillery course,

21:47.399 --> 22:03.675
artillery officer's course at Fort Selle, 
Oklahoma and that was a refresher of the same thing

21:47.399 --> 22:03.675
I had been given at Texas A&M.

22:06.980 --> 22:11.765
See at that time we had the branches of service in 
ROTC. After the war, as ROTC enrollment declined,

22:13.086 --> 22:30.864
ROTC became branch general, so they didn't teach 
the gunnery, the survey, the skills of the

22:13.086 --> 22:30.864
artilleryman in ROTC. They had to get those at 
service school afterward. And that's the way it is

22:34.868 --> 22:36.750
now. Early on, you see, we had the different 
branches. We had the cavalry, the engineers, the

22:39.706 --> 22:50.637
signal, the artillery, the various branches of 
service we had right in our ROTC on the campus. We

22:51.578 --> 23:02.489
were practically as well prepared as West Point 
cadet graduates to function in branches of the

22:51.578 --> 23:02.489
service. And we were commissioned in the branches 
of the service. When did you get overseas? Got

23:12.072 --> 23:18.462
overseas in September of 43. Second Division was 
sent to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland?

23:26.616 --> 23:27.777
Northern Ireland. That's where we went overseas. 
Well, of course it's obvious that The Allies were

23:36.974 --> 23:39.598
going to attack Fortress Europe.

23:42.402 --> 23:56.244
The primary attack forces were assembled in 
England, Great Britain, and the follow-up troops

23:42.402 --> 23:56.244
were established as nearby there as they could. 
Northern Ireland was nearby, was part of the

23:56.304 --> 24:02.053
British Empire, of course.

24:05.290 --> 24:06.972
So that's where we were stationed. We were there 
eight months. Then we got transferred to- In other

24:10.596 --> 24:15.401
words, you were just waiting for eight months and 
training? We were training hard, yeah, for eight

24:15.882 --> 24:19.426
months there.

24:22.329 --> 24:25.673
And of course- What were your feelings when you 
were there? Well, we knew what we were there for and

24:33.134 --> 24:35.296
We had real excellent training. It's ironical 
that some of our troops were attacked by the Irish

24:35.697 --> 24:41.463
Republican Army then. They were then? Yeah. The 
Irish Republican Army has been a factor over in

24:45.026 --> 24:53.295
Ireland ever since Ireland was divided back years 
and years ago. And of course they coveted some of

24:53.315 --> 24:58.080
our modern weapons and all. Some of our infantry 
companies had barely gotten to their village in

25:01.366 --> 25:10.454
Northern Ireland until some little groups 
attacked them to try to obtain weapons from Irish

25:01.366 --> 25:10.454
Republican Army. And of course, Southern Ireland 
was off-limits to us, so just the four counties in

25:12.156 --> 25:24.527
Northern Ireland where our division was 
stationed. In the maneuvers prior to the landing

25:24.547 --> 25:30.192
in Normandy, The three divisions that were 
identified as assault troops, I think it was the

25:30.577 --> 25:40.269
5th Corps, went on maneuvers. And two times in a 
row, one of the divisions, I believe it was the 28th

25:40.289 --> 25:50.241
Division, didn't perform well enough. So they got 
transferred out of the Corps, and the 2nd Division

25:51.883 --> 25:59.352
was moved from Northern Ireland to England. to 
Wales, actually, and given a mission of follow-up

25:59.568 --> 26:05.937
troops on the invasion. And that happened just a 
month before the invasion of Europe. So we're

26:11.104 --> 26:13.367
talking May 1944, then. That's right. It's 
amazing. The 2nd Division, being an O-line

26:17.373 --> 26:21.499
division, had taken winter training. They were 
moved from Fort Sam Houston to Camp McCoy,

26:23.161 --> 26:27.988
Wisconsin, in November of 42.

26:34.204 --> 26:37.488
November of 42. We took cold weather training. We 
also took air landing training along the way

26:42.313 --> 26:51.104
because aviation was getting to be a factor.

26:52.586 --> 26:56.170
The one kind of training that we had not been given 
was amphibious training, waterproofing our

26:58.141 --> 27:03.569
vehicles and all that, but that's what we did. So it 
really was a crash course in amphibious landings

27:03.609 --> 27:11.741
and that sort of thing after we got over to England, 
Wales.

27:15.046 --> 27:17.028
And prepared yourself then for the invasion. 
Prepared for the invasion, you bet. How did the,

27:19.412 --> 27:25.060
first how did the Northern Ireland people respond 
to your presence and then how did the Welsh?

27:27.790 --> 27:38.483
Well, generally

27:27.790 --> 27:38.483
we were fairly well accepted by people in Northern 
Ireland. I know in the little town where we were,

27:40.826 --> 27:53.861
there was some anxiety about the American 
soldiers dating the Irish girls. Really?

27:59.650 --> 28:07.700
that for a while we were under the command of 
General Patton. He came over to address us at one

28:07.760 --> 28:10.464
time. I was on duty back at the post. I really didn't 
get there to his address, but of course he was a

28:14.348 --> 28:24.081
tremendous leader, but kind of a foul mouthed old 
guy. He said that He told the troops assembled

28:27.865 --> 28:39.545
there that some of the ladies had complained that 
the graveyards and all around that there were too

28:27.865 --> 28:39.545
many cock sheaths around. And he said, you know, I 
told him I'm sure glad our soldiers are using them.

28:44.513 --> 28:54.109
He

28:44.513 --> 28:54.109
said, it is my belief that a soldier that won't 
fight

28:56.300 --> 28:58.102
You know, this is a public speech. That's what he 
was saying in the old days. Of course, we hear that

28:59.925 --> 29:02.949
word on television around. It's

29:03.009 --> 29:10.439
not too shocking to hear the word now, but it was a 
little shocking in those days. He was a salty old

29:10.500 --> 29:14.966
guy. So if we were taken out from under his command 
and put under Bradley's command for this 5th Corps

29:15.026 --> 29:24.619
for the invasion, but we later got back under 
Patton after the St. Louis breakout and we moved

29:24.970 --> 29:33.398
down to Brest. What were the men's feelings toward 
Patton and Bradley? Do you remember? Sure.

29:42.206 --> 29:53.577
Bradley was generally admired and respected,

29:42.206 --> 29:53.577
but Patton was a great leader, but he had a 
different style. He was a little more feared, and

29:57.139 --> 30:03.688
he was more of a domineering type. Bradley was 
considered to be kind of a soldier's general. He

30:07.173 --> 30:22.855
had been an enlisted man himself, and was 
considered as having far more empathy with

30:07.173 --> 30:22.855
troops, whereas Patton was, his style of 
leadership was different, flamboyant,

30:23.662 --> 30:27.507
domineering driver type. So I had to say that those 
were the feelings for those two generals. I'd say

30:36.019 --> 30:47.435
they loved Bradley, but they respected Patton for 
what he could do, but that they really didn't love

30:36.019 --> 30:47.435
him. Now how had your role changed from being here 
in Texas to being in Wales? Okay, along the way I had

30:55.792 --> 31:14.289
progressed through the ranks and

30:55.792 --> 31:14.289
in Wales I was actually on the ship going to 
Northern Ireland. My first command assignment

31:16.892 --> 31:20.836
was given to me. I was designated as communication 
officer.
