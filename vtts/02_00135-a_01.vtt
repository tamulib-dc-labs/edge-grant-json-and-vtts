WEBVTT

00:13.700 --> 00:21.732
Now I'm asking that you

00:13.700 --> 00:21.732
say something so this will record. Let's pick you 
up over there. Okay. What do you want to talk about?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.906
I wish we could talk about what a nice week it's 
been. Well, I want an idea.

00:38.296 --> 00:41.361
Now let's see if it's doing any better in between 
us. Let's see. Give your name, rate, horsepower,

00:45.554 --> 00:49.439
age, and everything else. I'm Joan Rowe. My 
horsepower is about zero right now. I'm 58. I'm

00:55.427 --> 01:02.497
still going to be 59.

01:02.517 --> 01:11.989
Today is February 27, and we're starting late in 
the morning at 6139 Berwyn in Dallas. And I have the

01:12.408 --> 01:20.756
pleasure of talking to Bob Latimer, class of 44, 
who was president of the association in 1972. Bob,

01:21.096 --> 01:26.841
why did you go to A&M in the first place?

01:30.344 --> 01:37.571
Well, I was graduating from high school in Fort 
Worth in 1940. Having grown up through the 30s,

01:42.749 --> 01:48.437
Everyone knew that World War II was coming. We 
didn't know what it would be called. We didn't know

01:51.741 --> 01:54.004
how it would start or anything else. But we knew it 
was impending.

01:58.049 --> 02:01.173
That was one force of thought. Another was that 
everyone,

02:01.995 --> 02:12.148
at least it was very clear to me, having gone to 
grade school at Bayard, Texas, and high school in

02:12.803 --> 02:25.275
Fort Worth, that the only people that were going to 
get anywhere in this world had to have a college

02:12.803 --> 02:25.275
education. Now, my family didn't have any money, 
and I set out to find scholarships wherever I

02:25.295 --> 02:31.501
could. As it turned out,

02:32.742 --> 02:42.051
as my search had gone past, well, Had to settle for 
TCU in Fort Worth and then in track at Arlington,

02:42.605 --> 02:50.011
neither of which I cared for. And I tried for the 
military academies. So I was

02:56.036 --> 03:12.510
really searching and A&M seemed beyond my reach 
until my uncle, class of 02, informed me of the

02:56.036 --> 03:12.510
newly created opportunity award scholarship. 
And the requirements for those as set out were the

03:18.238 --> 03:39.465
student had to have good grades and to have his note 
for $150 a year be endorsed by an A&M club. When I

03:41.367 --> 03:42.649
understood that, I felt like I had the grades to do 
it. My uncle, though he had been long prominent in

03:50.143 --> 03:59.594
the association of former students, was not in a 
position to provide any tuition. I didn't look for

03:59.674 --> 04:01.977
any from him. But the

04:01.997 --> 04:13.851
way I went about it was to court the fourth A&M club 
Every time they had a meeting, I went. And they got

04:17.404 --> 04:19.607
to know me and know me well. And so as the selection 
process evolved, well, I was granted one of the

04:20.689 --> 04:31.783
original Opportunity Award scholarships. And 
how did you get to College Station when your first

04:32.825 --> 04:37.471
visit down there? Well, one of my first visits, was 
at the end of school in 1940, at the end of A&M. My

04:48.915 --> 04:59.350
good friend Bob Halton, Bobby Halton, he was part 
of the Halton Jewish family in Fort Worth. His

05:01.934 --> 05:11.648
mother and father took him and they took me down to 
pick up his brother who was G.W. Holden, who was the

05:14.440 --> 05:18.246
class of 42.

05:20.289 --> 05:22.532
And that's the first time I saw her. Basically, I 
only saw the then-new dorms as they finished their

05:22.552 --> 05:28.681
first year. And we loaded up the car and went back to 
Fort Worth. Then that fall, when you go as a

05:34.088 --> 05:37.713
student, how did you get down there? Well, I was 
part of a a rather active group in Fort Worth

05:42.931 --> 05:49.642
Basketball and Arlington Heights High School. 
There was a big network of high school

05:49.662 --> 05:58.396
fraternities and sororities and they had 
frequent dances. And the time for me to go A&M was a

05:59.598 --> 06:09.715
week ahead of time due to the fact that, I don't 
think I mentioned earlier, The scholarship not

06:10.285 --> 06:24.357
only included getting a note endorsed by the Fort 
Worth A&M Club, but also would provide, while I was

06:10.285 --> 06:24.357
at school, a job that paid $150. Well, my job was to 
be a janitor. And that year, someone had the idea

06:28.580 --> 06:40.090
that it would be a good idea to train all the student 
janitors in janitoring. which included

06:40.306 --> 06:49.496
mastering the mysteries of dormitory plumbing. 
Well, they called for all of us would-be janitors

06:49.516 --> 06:55.162
to be there a week early. And so the time for me to go, 
I went to a dance at the Fort Worth Casino and had a

06:56.463 --> 07:08.676
friend get me into downtown Fort Worth in time for 
the 11 o'clock Owl, Missouri Pacific train. And I

07:17.400 --> 07:31.156
rode that through the night and got thrown off the 
train at 5.30 in the morning at the College Station

07:17.400 --> 07:31.156
Station. And not even having been in that spot 
before, all I could do was after my footlocker on my

07:38.272 --> 07:43.256
back, and go up to the YMCA. And I got up on the main 
floor, found one of those old porcelain couches,

07:44.337 --> 07:57.850
and lay down and finished the night until other 
people arrived. All right. Describe A&M

08:00.372 --> 08:06.017
physically in 1940 when you arrived. Well, it was, 
of course it was, this was

08:08.191 --> 08:31.661
September the 11th I believe was the date, but it 
had been a hot summer and there wasn't much

08:08.191 --> 08:31.661
evidence of any moisture in the soil, so it was 
dusty everywhere.

08:34.985 --> 08:36.207
The walk from The railroad station to Hawaii was 
not arduous. It just took a while. Law and Ferrier

08:43.866 --> 08:45.628
Halls were there. The Beagle Stand was out at the 
intersection of the walks.

08:54.980 --> 09:05.333
And it was

08:54.980 --> 09:05.333
those buildings, the buildings there at the time 
were, of course, I didn't know

09:05.887 --> 09:13.335
it was sold. So I waited until people came awake and 
went over and reported to where they told us to. And

09:23.266 --> 09:26.750
then I set about trying to adjust to the pattern. 
All right. Was the new core dorm area finished

09:28.672 --> 09:32.996
then? It had been finished. 1939. Where did you 
live your freshman year? Well that first week I was

09:40.790 --> 10:04.497
in Leggett because that's close to where they had 
their school and when I was assigned a unit that was

09:40.790 --> 10:04.497
my my friend Haltman and I had applied to be 
roommates and that was granted and we were

09:40.790 --> 10:04.497
assigned to be and H battery coast artillery which 
was assigned the top two floors of Mitchell Hall.

10:12.747 --> 10:18.574
Now how did you happen to get that unit coast 
artillery? Well I fight for coast artillery. I've

10:21.939 --> 10:33.353
been an aviation dog all my high school life and I 
desperately wanted to get into flying and they

10:21.939 --> 10:33.353
said that Part of the coach artillery's job was 
anti-aircraft, so I figured that was as close as

10:33.721 --> 10:41.328
you could get, and that set up fair. Did you have the 
impression that people normally got the branch

10:41.349 --> 10:48.516
they requested, or was that unusual? In general, 
they got what they asked for. There was such a

10:51.378 --> 11:02.209
great, I guess you'd say, a great number that 
didn't have any idea what it was about. And they

11:02.932 --> 11:09.918
obviously weren't trying to leave it to us. Oh, 
yes, yes.

11:17.685 --> 11:25.892
That

11:17.685 --> 11:25.892
first week was a rather interesting one. Wendell 
Horsley was a great guy and later famous as a

11:25.932 --> 11:32.938
placement office man. I was attracted to him. He 
would always give me a friendly smile or a wink. I

11:44.302 --> 12:02.740
adjusted to the rigors of no sheets or anything 
else in the old double deck bunks there in Leggett

11:44.302 --> 12:02.740
and got to the end of the week without The thing that 
was notable about that is I got a little bit of

12:03.378 --> 12:17.838
insight into the school before the upperclassmen 
came in. Now, were most of the trainees in this

12:18.659 --> 12:24.747
janitorial program, were most of those freshmen? 
No, I think I was unusual. Oh, okay. I say I got used

12:30.435 --> 12:31.917
to it. I bought some sheets, so I had sheets and kind 
of took care of my own business.

12:45.406 --> 13:01.347
The thing that, well,

12:45.406 --> 13:01.347
the action began to happen on the following 
weekend, and the janitor's school was finished,

12:45.406 --> 13:01.347
and by then I...

13:02.660 --> 13:09.950
more awareness, but certainly not any more 
knowledge of the dormitory plumbing than I had

13:02.660 --> 13:09.950
before. Fortunately, my assignment in the 
janitorial job was the book stacks in the back of

13:09.970 --> 13:21.626
the library. In Cushing? In Cushing. Oh. And 
there's a number of stories that go with that. But

13:30.478 --> 13:31.840
as far as getting started, it was all a mystery. And 
how Paulton and I were assigned room 77 in Mitchell

13:37.695 --> 13:45.928
Hall, we don't know. But we went over there to, 
well,

13:47.510 --> 14:01.050
on Saturday when he came and the rest of them came, 
we began to filter in and find our places. Well, the

14:05.666 --> 14:19.125
sophomores and the juniors and seniors were 
coming around and beginning to look at places and

14:05.666 --> 14:19.125
see what was there and see where they were. Now 
there, of course, the fifth year men, we had four of

14:19.265 --> 14:28.438
them, and the seniors knew they got corner rooms 
and juniors got whatever was left in their

14:29.515 --> 14:37.663
favorite room. We were on the, they called every 
floor a stoop. And Alden and I were on the fourth

14:42.267 --> 14:45.991
stoop. And Mitchell was in the shape of a figure 
eight. So there was an inner courtyard. We were on

14:52.798 --> 14:54.279
the fourth floor.

14:57.082 --> 14:58.223
I guess at courtyard was about 50 feet square and 
pavement on the bottom concrete so that any time a

15:00.110 --> 15:27.788
bottle or any other vulnerable piece of glassware 
landed it not only hit and splattered within there

15:00.110 --> 15:27.788
a heck of a racket but probably four stories four 
stories of walls up there so uh But we got in and

15:29.742 --> 15:59.378
began to get, we very quickly were organized by the 
sophomores and indoctrinated that we had to speak

15:29.742 --> 15:59.378
to everybody and we had our names and then on was 
fish so and so and everyone else was mister and we

15:29.742 --> 15:59.378
had a fish strike it was called which was about a 
three-eighths of an inch white band around our

16:00.185 --> 16:15.507
left cuff on our shirts, on the press uniforms 
while we just didn't have any

16:00.185 --> 16:15.507
service bar for a year. Describe the issue of 
uniforms that the typical student had. How many

16:22.678 --> 16:25.041
changes of what did you have? Well, of course we 
were the Every student,

16:30.003 --> 16:41.120
well I say every student, almost every student had 
to be in the Corps of Cadets. We were enrolled, we

16:42.141 --> 16:56.803
went through over at the assembly hall which was 
then replaced by a chapel and then the assembly

16:42.141 --> 16:56.803
hall they had a They arranged for it to provide 
clothing. Assembly Hall and the Exchange Store,

17:03.114 --> 17:14.470
which was not far from, it was east of Leggett. We 
were issued,

17:14.690 --> 17:20.378
as I recall,

17:26.450 --> 17:55.845
with two khaki shirts, a tie,

17:26.450 --> 17:55.845
a wool blouse with blue lapels,

17:26.450 --> 17:55.845
and wool pants, and

17:26.450 --> 17:55.845
I don't know what they call it. Socks? Shoe. Socks, 
shoes? No shoes and no socks. So you provided that.

18:03.868 --> 18:03.948
Yes. And did you have the little, what we would 
later call overseas caps yet? What did you wear on

18:10.056 --> 18:11.158
your head? Well, we had the garrison caps. Oh, 
okay. The round ones. Okay. And we also had

18:15.643 --> 18:17.646
overseas caps. Okay. And... On the... On the... 
overseas cap, there was a distinctive colored

18:25.327 --> 18:33.696
braid to denote the branch that you were in. In our 
case, we were artillery, so we had the right red

18:33.716 --> 18:40.203
band. And did you, were you quickly reminded that 
you must speak in Aggie slang and lingo? Well, you

18:47.050 --> 18:53.477
knew you, uh, about the Second or third day, you 
began to get indoctrinated.

19:01.541 --> 19:09.590
My thought process at the moment is getting a 
uniform on day, like on the Saturday and Sunday of

19:01.541 --> 19:09.590
Monday. And the first night that everybody was 
there, which would have been the Sunday night,

19:10.651 --> 19:24.105
before, maybe Saturday before school started. 
But all us freshmen were bunked up. And every

19:35.324 --> 19:40.549
class, there was no mixing of classes in a single 
room. Every room had either freshmen or

19:40.569 --> 19:44.832
sophomores or whatever the class was. But there 
was no mix. But about midnight, why, at the end of

19:46.814 --> 19:53.620
the shack, it occurred out in the hall. And so we 
stuck our head out to see what was going on, and

19:54.595 --> 20:00.644
there was a fire, fire, fire. And there were kids 
running up and down all over and hear the

20:01.465 --> 20:15.447
expression, come on president, come on 
president, come on president, it's on

20:01.465 --> 20:15.447
the fly. Every poor face got to stand up and shake, 
and I don't believe a drop hit. With all that had

20:23.047 --> 20:35.779
been heard and all of the apprehension and scared 
to death of what was going to happen next, I don't

20:23.047 --> 20:35.779
think that job hit them. And that old floor, old 
Mitchell with the wooden floor placement, the

20:35.799 --> 20:43.005
floor was well worn. So there really was a fire? Oh, 
yeah. There's some paper right there. Oh, okay.

20:48.751 --> 20:51.433
And this was probably not the first time that, game 
had been played? Well, it was for us. No, but I mean,

20:55.051 --> 20:56.213
you think... I expect those sophomores had some 
experience. That's what I was wondering. Now, did

21:01.921 --> 21:10.452
y'all use the same... was the slang then about what 
it is now as far as you know? Y'all were fish and your

21:10.492 --> 21:14.117
roommate was your old lady? Well, I...

21:19.504 --> 21:21.387
I would submit... that the 1990s version

21:22.767 --> 21:32.338
is basically more severe in a number of ways.

21:35.642 --> 21:51.120
We didn't have anybody shouting at us, per se, like 
what has been carried over from the Marine Corps,

21:35.642 --> 21:51.120
per se.

21:52.872 --> 21:55.696
and all that sort of thing. We didn't have any of 
that. The freshman had to walk in the streets. If

22:03.107 --> 22:21.613
the freshman saw, well, they spoke to everyone, 
but if the freshman saw an upperclassman of his

22:03.107 --> 22:21.613
outfit, he spoke to Mr. So-and-so, and if Mr. 
So-and-so was talking to somebody else, The

22:22.201 --> 22:32.133
freshman either knew the other person's name and 
called it, or else he went up and met him,

22:22.201 --> 22:32.133
introduced himself, and then went on his way. That 
was, and to overlook introducing or speaking to an

22:34.155 --> 22:48.512
upperclassman's friend or acquaintance was 
really a serious business. Now, I'll back up a

22:53.999 --> 23:12.415
moment to say that I was on my guard about things 
because I had in some way acquired the book Fish

22:53.999 --> 23:12.415
Sergeant. Have you seen Fish Sergeant? Fish 
Sergeant was a little book about It's been

23:19.306 --> 23:24.674
reprinted. And

23:25.716 --> 23:33.908
Fish Sargent was a story of a kid named Fish Hooks. 
And it went through all of the general repeated

23:35.571 --> 23:45.786
type So

23:48.483 --> 24:13.109
I

23:48.483 --> 24:13.109
was on my guard and I didn't jump at everything and I 
wasn't quite, with all due respect to my buddies, I

23:48.483 --> 24:13.109
wasn't quite the sucker as a lot of them were. 
Alright, so this book was kind of a, for you, a kind

24:13.129 --> 24:16.853
of a A guide. A guide. A guide, but you know, I had 
read that thing through and through before I went

24:20.576 --> 24:36.730
down there because I was so apprehensive about all 
of the

24:20.576 --> 24:36.730
things in life at all that put me in depression. 
Tell me about, where did y'all eat, and tell me

24:36.750 --> 24:40.774
about the chow hall routine. Well, let me get over 
one more. Oh, I'm sorry.

24:49.537 --> 24:55.165
Let's say everybody was there on Sunday night. I 
think it was the 18th, I'm not sure. Everybody was

24:58.189 --> 24:59.691
there on Sunday night. But we've been through the 
week during which, beginning the first night,

25:00.532 --> 25:07.762
everybody was there. All the freshmen were 
gathered into a single room, and as many

25:08.703 --> 25:15.592
sophomores as we could crowd in. The freshmen were 
all sitting on the floor. And the

25:18.697 --> 25:41.818
sophomore proceeded to lecture on what it took to, 
quote, get the fish on the line, as dictated by the

25:18.697 --> 25:41.818
juniors and seniors. Now, other than running,

25:47.536 --> 25:57.206
details which are airing for our upperclassmen, 
let's say the juniors and seniors, the freshmen

25:47.536 --> 25:57.206
jumped to the sophomores primarily. The 
sophomores were responsible for the behavior of

25:57.226 --> 26:00.350
the freshmen. Sure. And if the freshmen got lagged 
or didn't perform well or maybe just because the

26:01.291 --> 26:14.505
upperclassmen didn't like it anyway, why the 
freshmen would take it out. seniors take it out on

26:15.160 --> 26:22.047
the junior, and the junior take it out on the 
sophomore.

26:22.067 --> 26:33.117
Well, number one in this whole story is that we 
didn't, we were not touched by a board until after

26:22.067 --> 26:33.117
Thanksgiving. The,

26:33.137 --> 26:44.408
but a bleed meeting would consist of all the 
instructions of walking in the street, speaking,

26:33.137 --> 26:44.408
meeting, Yes, sir. There were no, no exaggerated. 
Yes, sir. Or all that sort of none of that stuff.

26:55.097 --> 26:56.579
There was no shoe polishing. There's no brass box 
for the class. Every cadet did his own.

27:06.092 --> 27:13.382
The later years, all of my things thought that the 
notion of shining shoes and and so on and just into

27:13.868 --> 27:18.013
all of it. Were there any things that you now look 
back on that you think of were inappropriate

27:18.033 --> 27:26.523
hazing in your days?

27:31.028 --> 27:32.510
No, not really. There have been some rough times at 
A&M. I mean by that, oh, I think it was in the 30s.

27:43.552 --> 27:49.057
seven or eight while I was there. There was a big 
furor over the possibility the railroad might

27:49.077 --> 27:56.104
move the station in the blind. The field artillery 
got out there with their 75 guns and lined them up on

27:56.124 --> 28:12.040
the tracks and informed the railroad they were 
going to have a station there.

28:12.712 --> 28:33.220
No, but I mentioned that but also there had been a 
couple of pretty rough incidents and so the word

28:12.712 --> 28:33.220
was out early on that nobody would get the board 
until after Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving of

28:33.240 --> 28:38.668
course was the mid-semester break The grades were 
out and then you'd see how many were going to be

28:38.952 --> 28:42.916
there. The most telling thing of all of that was 
that Dr. Brayden, who was a venerable and

28:43.997 --> 28:59.931
long-time

28:43.997 --> 28:59.931
theater and chemistry department.

28:59.951 --> 29:03.975
B-R-A-Y-H-R Brayden.

29:03.995 --> 29:08.419
We went to his first chemistry lecture. I was in 
engineering, an old freshman taking engineering

29:08.686 --> 29:17.756
at an identical curriculum.

29:20.580 --> 29:26.346
I never shall forget the first day I sat in that 
chemistry lecture room. There were about 330 boys

29:26.366 --> 29:32.173
in there. And the first thing he said was, look at 
the guy in front of you and the one behind you. One on

29:37.103 --> 29:39.565
your right and one on your left. He said there'd be 
one of you graduates.

29:45.271 --> 29:52.538
I guess among everybody that was the most telling 
statement that they'd encountered. Did that add

29:52.818 --> 29:54.560
to your determination? Oh yeah. But I had to be 
under my bonnet because I didn't have enough money

29:56.962 --> 30:05.490
to go anywhere.

30:06.415 --> 30:14.303
My father had money when I was younger, but it was 
not available when I came around. But I was

30:15.625 --> 30:23.373
determined to do the best I could at A&M to get the 
best job opportunity when I got out. And that's all

30:24.694 --> 30:28.318
I needed. All right, let's go back to the chow hall 
now. Tell me about meals and where they were and

30:31.762 --> 30:36.389
what the routine was.

30:40.895 --> 30:50.108
Meals were at, I think I'm right, 7 a.m., noon, and 
5.45 p.m.

30:53.413 --> 30:59.001
There would be a whistle in the dawn five minutes 
ahead of time to And we were in Mitchell Hall, which

30:59.504 --> 31:08.795
is now where the

30:59.504 --> 31:08.795
infirmary is. But that was on the, we were the 
nearest, and across the military walk was the, we

31:09.897 --> 31:22.753
were the nearest dorms to Sbisa. And when 
everybody was in position, All the way down

31:27.905 --> 31:30.743
military wall.
