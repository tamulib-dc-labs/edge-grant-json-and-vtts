WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:08.828
The department began making a very conscious effort to hire minorities.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.673
In fact, we hired some rather inferior minorities.

00:13.894 --> 00:15.956
Fortunately for us, in many ways, they left.

00:18.919 --> 00:25.847
We hired one person in American Studies that couldn't teach and didn't get along with students and that sort of thing.

00:26.928 --> 00:30.392
At one time, we probably had more minorities than the other department on the campus.

00:30.710 --> 00:34.154
as far as women goes, blacks, and Hispanics.

00:35.195 --> 00:40.641
Because we've had as many as seven or eight females and a couple of blacks and a couple of Hispanics in the department.

00:41.502 --> 00:43.805
If you look at any other department on campus, where would you find that?

00:46.148 --> 00:46.848
No place else.

00:49.051 --> 00:54.557
Do you know of any problems that a minority faculty member had in the department?

00:54.798 --> 00:59.603
I don't know of any problems they ever had except one of our faculty members

01:00.376 --> 01:09.489
black one a number of times was interviewed in the fat and talked a great deal about prejudice and things like that and things of that sort.

01:10.751 --> 01:12.233
He never said it had ever happened to him.

01:12.773 --> 01:19.263
In fact, my view on it is that the department has gone over backwards to take care of blacks, Hispanics.

01:19.984 --> 01:23.028
They've got preferential treatment and women then.

01:24.991 --> 01:26.653
And we let a woman go one time who had not

01:27.393 --> 01:32.283
who had not produced, who had not finished her dissertation, but that was part of her contract and she was let go.

01:35.289 --> 01:43.746
Some other women who did not work out very well, black and white, left voluntarily and that took care of the situation then.

01:45.410 --> 01:49.097
We had another Hispanic who was not working out very well and he left voluntarily.

01:49.516 --> 01:59.326
So in some ways, some of the minorities and others who we hired have left on their own and did not necessitate, but several have been let go.

01:59.346 --> 02:09.116
Do you remember in the department any tricks or jokes that anybody ever played on any faculty member?

02:11.058 --> 02:11.859
Not that I know of.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.741
I think that was pretty much gone by the time I came.

02:15.782 --> 02:18.325
I've known some that were played by some of the faculty members.

02:19.688 --> 02:24.975
I've heard of, but I wasn't privy to.

02:25.636 --> 02:31.424
And so, you know, to speak of them, like I've heard the story that someone gave Dr. Nancy a subscription to Playboy.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.906
Yes, I've heard of that.

02:32.926 --> 02:37.112
I've heard it, but I don't know who did it, so no one ever told me they did it.

02:37.573 --> 02:39.796
So I really can't say about that then.

02:40.998 --> 02:44.903
For you personally, what were some high points, some

02:46.047 --> 02:50.893
proud moments, happy moments, as you look back on that four decades?

02:50.913 --> 02:51.994
Well, let's see.

02:54.217 --> 03:01.405
I guess I was nominated to be the Piper professor from the department and the college.

03:02.447 --> 03:03.328
I didn't win it.

03:03.528 --> 03:10.757
A gentleman from engineering got it, but I was the nominee put forward by the college for that then.

03:11.598 --> 03:13.540
And I looked upon my years as a

03:13.958 --> 03:22.740
undergraduate advisor was very rewarding to me and I think I did a good job and the department profited from that and I got to know students better along that line, you know.

03:24.685 --> 03:31.782
As Phi Alpha Theta, I was the advisor to Phi Alpha Theta for 20 plus years and I won

03:32.774 --> 03:43.271
I won the National Award for Outstanding Fowl Potato advisor one year, and we had a very— Did you organize that?

03:43.651 --> 03:44.693
No, no, it was organized.

03:45.274 --> 03:48.960
Henry Deltloff, Garland Bates, and I, and were you involved?

03:49.000 --> 03:49.480
I can't remember now.

03:49.500 --> 03:49.941
I don't think so.

03:49.961 --> 03:52.084
But three or four of us were involved in organizing that.

03:52.125 --> 03:52.645
About when?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.892
We started organizing that while we were still in Nagel Hall.

03:57.091 --> 04:03.762
So I was advised for almost 25 years, and Henry and Garland were involved in it for three or four or five years.

04:04.002 --> 04:05.625
Now that's the undergraduate history?

04:05.745 --> 04:06.045
History.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.588
Or graduate too, anyone.

04:07.808 --> 04:07.968
Yeah.

04:07.989 --> 04:09.090
And faculty members.

04:09.110 --> 04:14.178
You remember in those early days, we used to have full initiations.

04:14.679 --> 04:19.808
Well, it goes back to 70s, late 60s, and we had candles and flowers and roses.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.831
We had dinners and things like that.

04:22.031 --> 04:23.233
We went full ring.

04:23.483 --> 04:31.236
I remember Betty Unaburger was in favor of that, and I remember Betty carrying a candle, and I always kind of watched it, and I thought, that just doesn't seem to appropriate, Betty carrying that candle.

04:31.256 --> 04:42.715
Well, we were very active for a long time, and we actually were very active, and Larry pushed it too, and I had three regional conferences here, which were quite successful.

04:43.877 --> 04:48.124
Money got scarce, and Larry could not put any money into it anymore, and so

04:48.458 --> 05:00.676
I asked Larry at that time, I got tired of pushing it, really, and many organizations like that, the depth and quality of your leadership dictates on what it's going to be.

05:01.297 --> 05:05.544
And I found myself doing more and more and more, and there was no reward for it.

05:05.564 --> 05:08.368
So I finally went to Larry and asked him, what did he want to do?

05:08.428 --> 05:12.935
Like, for instance, we'd have a speaker come in, and we have seven people there.

05:12.955 --> 05:14.497
And I said, wait a minute now, you know.

05:14.898 --> 05:15.799
And I asked Larry,

05:16.066 --> 05:19.030
Do I have the power to browbeat, order people to be there?

05:19.531 --> 05:20.292
What do you want to do?

05:21.213 --> 05:30.526
And he decided that we would not, that we would let it be just voluntary, and it pretty much went downhill then.

05:30.986 --> 05:32.388
Is it still going?

05:32.408 --> 05:34.211
Oh, it's still going, yes, and it's still active.

05:34.391 --> 05:35.172
Good.

05:35.641 --> 05:37.563
It's like it was with me at the end there.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.927
When I pushed it very hard and worked with it, it was very active.

05:40.947 --> 05:41.728
We did a good job.

05:42.189 --> 05:45.953
When I got a little tired of pushing it and that sort of thing, it declined.

05:46.914 --> 05:50.058
We have not had any strong presidents in a long time.

05:50.859 --> 05:55.505
When I was in the University of Texas, it was considered to be an honor to be president.

05:56.546 --> 05:57.447
Towards the end,

05:57.899 --> 05:59.382
we were begging people to be president.

05:59.422 --> 06:04.871
And when that happened, I said, wait a minute, man, if I've got to beg somebody to be president of Alabama, something's wrong.

06:05.072 --> 06:07.155
That would be an honor you ought to be able to put on your media.

06:07.295 --> 06:08.458
I was president of Alabama.

06:10.742 --> 06:13.326
Other happy moments, high points.

06:15.483 --> 06:29.764
Well, I think some of the complications we had and, you know, the inaugurations, or whatever you want to call it, of the new presidents, of Williams and so on and so on, were fun and enjoyable then.

06:31.306 --> 06:33.850
Of the presidents that you served under, who were your favorites?

06:33.910 --> 06:36.073
I'm not going to ask the other side.

06:36.414 --> 06:41.141
Well, I think, no doubt, Rudder and Williams.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.287
They both served a long time.

06:45.622 --> 06:49.286
But despite Rutter's faults, the university ran smoothly.

06:50.007 --> 06:51.949
Major decisions were made and carried out.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.593
And history department prospered in those days.

06:55.193 --> 06:56.695
And I think the same thing under Williams.

06:57.336 --> 06:59.178
Some of the other presidents I knew less of.

07:00.279 --> 07:03.783
And I think there was more controversy in some of those presidents.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.205
But I think those two.

07:07.047 --> 07:09.250
Vandiver was all, I got along with Vandiver pretty well.

07:09.991 --> 07:11.132
And liked Vandiver.

07:12.814 --> 07:15.257
But things kind of coasted under Vandiver pretty much, yeah.

07:16.756 --> 07:29.793
What advice would, let's make believe you're the new consultant to the department, what advice would you give for the history department today?

07:32.297 --> 07:43.492
Well, I think I would tell them that we really need to decide on what specialties we're going to do, and we need to look at that in a very cold light.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.835
We can't compete with the University of Texas.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.896
They're already there, and they've got a long road history.

07:50.317 --> 07:55.966
We could look at the rest of the colleges in the state, the major ones, and see what they're trying to do.

07:56.728 --> 08:02.157
I still think that military history is the one place where we could really excel and could really do well in that.

08:03.579 --> 08:07.746
Texas history is not emphasized at Texas anymore, and I think we could really do well there.

08:08.126 --> 08:11.552
I think we could recruit well there, and I think we could get our library strengthened.

08:11.887 --> 08:16.631
There's lots of text material out if we'd simply go out and look for it, which we've not done.

08:16.691 --> 08:19.214
I think the new dean of the library is amenable to that.

08:19.774 --> 08:24.398
I think that Fred Heath would be willing to work on that, and I think we could do that.

08:24.779 --> 08:27.101
But the problem with that is that that's colloquial.

08:27.641 --> 08:34.307
And there are a lot of people in the department who think we should be, they seem to think that a national image can just develop out of nothing.

08:34.568 --> 08:39.312
They talk about doing this, but we don't have the wherewithal to do it.

08:39.528 --> 08:45.018
It takes a pile of money to recruit a big name in medieval history or whatever it's going to be.

08:45.579 --> 08:47.022
And I think you have to face reality.

08:47.303 --> 08:50.128
We can build a name in local areas.

08:50.769 --> 08:53.034
And I think we need to pick three or four areas.

08:53.074 --> 08:53.715
We've never really done.

08:53.735 --> 08:54.617
We've talked.

08:54.637 --> 08:56.079
But again, we've talked in generalities.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.404
And we've talked in areas that we're never going to be.

08:58.424 --> 08:59.646
We don't have the library.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.597
We don't have the wherewithal to do that.

09:03.881 --> 09:08.195
And that's what I would tell the department, really bite hard and decide what we're going to do.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.589
I think also

09:13.210 --> 09:17.335
I think it's all good and well to leave developmental department people alone.

09:17.955 --> 09:26.425
But I think one office hours a week on Friday from 5 to 6 is just really terrible.

09:26.965 --> 09:35.014
I'm not saying you should spend 8 to 12 or 8 to 4 there, but I think you ought to keep reasonable hours before students can come see you and you ought to be available.

09:35.515 --> 09:36.756
And I don't think they're doing that.

09:37.637 --> 09:39.319
I don't say you should love A&M.

09:40.210 --> 09:47.558
But I think that if you can't enjoy A&M and want to be part of it, I think something's wrong really then with it.

09:49.239 --> 09:49.480
All right.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.821
Next, the last question then.

09:51.822 --> 09:57.128
Let's make believe someone walks up to you and gives you a million-dollar check with the requirement.

09:57.168 --> 10:03.575
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what it would go for.

10:03.615 --> 10:08.800
What would you, if you had the capability to give them a major gift to A&M, what would it be for?

10:09.218 --> 10:10.320
I think I would have it.

10:10.400 --> 10:15.267
I think I would establish a chair in history and I think the other half would go to the library.

10:15.828 --> 10:16.809
And what specialties?

10:17.009 --> 10:18.331
Put a purchase of books.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.414
It would be in Texas history or southern history.

10:20.735 --> 10:21.536
What about the chair?

10:22.457 --> 10:23.519
It would be in those areas too.

10:25.722 --> 10:29.067
I would put it in an area which I think we could do well in.

10:29.502 --> 10:36.196
In fact, I would not be against maybe military history doing that then, but it would be an area in which I thought we could develop something in.

10:38.341 --> 10:41.989
Do you think of other things we haven't talked about that we should?

10:42.951 --> 10:44.915
Well, I've enjoyed my time at A&M.

10:44.955 --> 10:47.260
I came to A&M without any thought of staying here.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.462
I had no idea.

10:48.482 --> 10:49.705
I think that most of us are that way.

10:50.090 --> 10:50.831
He had no idea.

10:50.891 --> 10:52.853
My wife thought I was bringing her to the end of the world.

10:53.233 --> 10:56.877
We went from Houston to Austin, and Austin was a dinky town in 1956.

10:57.018 --> 10:59.180
It was a dinky town.

10:59.260 --> 10:59.821
I'll use that.

10:59.861 --> 11:06.808
Sears was mainly a mail order area, and we finally grew to attach to that.

11:06.928 --> 11:15.378
It grew, and we left there to come here to A&M where they rolled up the sidewalks at night, and there was only one place in town where you could get any food after 10 o'clock at night.

11:15.538 --> 11:18.561
That was Franklin's, and it was a beer joint.

11:19.199 --> 11:20.581
But it was a good place to raise children.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.623
And we had two children, and we enjoyed it.

11:23.084 --> 11:33.917
And we found that A&M students, I think on the whole, are more religious, more conscientious, and more conservative, and more family-oriented than most places.

11:33.957 --> 11:35.299
And certainly that's true of Texas.

11:35.819 --> 11:38.082
And I found them to be on the whole be good kids.

11:38.763 --> 11:39.684
And I enjoyed teaching them.

11:40.144 --> 11:41.266
I met a few bad apples.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.289
And I think that'd be true of any place.

11:44.310 --> 11:45.891
I didn't dislike my time at Texas.

11:45.931 --> 11:48.835
I enjoyed my three years teaching at Texas.

11:49.152 --> 11:51.094
And a lot of the problems we have at A&M, they had them there.

11:51.434 --> 12:02.466
This idea that schools were all different as a bunch of bull, because certainly some of the problems I had here at A&M, some smarty girls were no more interested in school than some of the Aggies I've had at times along that line.

12:03.668 --> 12:09.494
So last question I can think of is what feelings do you hold in your heart for A&M today?

12:09.994 --> 12:11.496
I'm not an Aggie, of course.

12:11.516 --> 12:12.977
My wife's an Aggie, tenant class.

12:12.997 --> 12:14.019
My two boys are Aggies.

12:14.519 --> 12:18.163
My two boys and two girls by marriage have nine Aggie degrees between them.

12:18.852 --> 12:25.788
And when I did advising, I used to tell my students that I don't think they can go to a better place for general education than A&M.

12:27.793 --> 12:28.715
It's a good school.

12:28.735 --> 12:29.757
There are other good schools, too.

12:29.897 --> 12:32.263
There's nothing wrong with going to Texas University or SMU.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.488
But I think A&M is a very good place to go.

12:35.069 --> 12:35.951
We have a lot of strengths.

12:35.971 --> 12:37.114
We have some weaknesses.

12:37.567 --> 12:38.870
And I see nothing wrong with the Corps.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.473
I think the Corps is great for some people.

12:41.515 --> 12:43.479
People in the Corps keep it their whole lives.

12:43.519 --> 12:49.993
I wonder how many people graduate from most colleges 40 years down the line still have a tie to that school that they can hold to.

12:50.053 --> 12:51.997
I don't think many, but Aggies do.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.684
I think the tie A&M has, we are different.

12:55.704 --> 12:58.410
Aggies are different in that sense.

12:58.863 --> 13:01.246
Disaster of Bonfire is an example of that, really.

13:02.087 --> 13:02.868
A&M is different.

13:03.789 --> 13:07.193
Not always good things, maybe, but I think basically good.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.374
I think most of the things are good.

13:09.916 --> 13:10.757
I thought it should change.

13:10.777 --> 13:11.818
I'll tell you, that girl's in.

13:11.838 --> 13:17.105
I thought the course should not be compulsory, but those changes like that, I think that A&M is a fine place to be.

13:17.425 --> 13:20.008
And we raised two kids here, and our best friends are here.

13:20.068 --> 13:23.212
We've lived here almost most of our life now.

13:24.453 --> 13:25.014
Let's quit there.

13:25.675 --> 13:25.815
Good.
