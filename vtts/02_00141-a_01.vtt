WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:08.539
have the pleasure of being in Houston and to chat 
with Melvin Maltz. Now we'll stop and hope that

00:08.559 --> 00:13.687
it's working.

00:13.707 --> 00:16.211
This is April 28, and we're in Houston. First 
question, why did you go to A&M in the first place?

00:21.980 --> 00:24.244
What led you there instead of to somewhere else? My 
dad was always interested in A&M, and he took me

00:26.227 --> 00:29.953
there. from the time I was a little boy when he'd go 
up there to try to sell paper products to the dining

00:30.507 --> 00:36.413
room. Also in 1937, 38, and 41, 42 I

00:37.594 --> 00:45.822
think. Anyway, those three or four years I went to 
Camp Stewart where Bill James was then the line

00:46.563 --> 00:56.633
coach at A&M and had a great influence because he 
brought many of the great stars from the 1939 and 40

00:57.760 --> 01:06.392
football teams there for unofficial, of course, 
summer practices and workouts and to get in shape.

01:06.592 --> 01:17.828
I knew many of those people and kind of felt good 
about following where they were because I admired

01:06.592 --> 01:17.828
them and had fun with them as a little kid.

01:19.023 --> 01:22.668
I knew I wasn't comfortable going to co-ed school. 
I had been invited to a number of co-ed schools for

01:22.688 --> 01:27.915
parties and rush parties. I didn't like the idea of 
going, so I guess I just took it as help. And I had

01:34.224 --> 01:43.456
several good friends that I grew up with that were a 
year ahead of me, and I thought I could get help from

01:34.224 --> 01:43.456
them if necessary and lean on them, and I ended 
there. Now you grew up in Houston. Yes. San Jacinto

01:46.377 --> 01:47.318
High School. San Jacinto High School, OK. And how 
well prepared did you think you were for college

01:47.338 --> 01:56.010
academically? Oh, academically? As it turned 
out, academically the first year wasn't bad

01:57.292 --> 02:04.221
because many or some of the subjects were repeats 
of what I had in high school. But I think you might be

02:04.242 --> 02:12.012
interested in how we got the A&M the very first day. 
Oh, yes. That's the next question. How'd you get

02:13.694 --> 02:15.557
there for that? First beginning of instruction. A 
good friend of mine that I grew up with, Gerald, Ben

02:17.899 --> 02:25.292
Broginski, now Grogan, was from Bryan. He moved to 
Houston many years, or five or ten years earlier.

02:29.359 --> 02:32.965
And we became friends, and his mother wanted to go 
back for a visit. So, and the first of June was to be

02:33.847 --> 02:40.819
our high school graduation, and May 30th was 
thereabouts was the day we had to enroll. So his

02:41.795 --> 02:51.109
mother drove us up there doing late, let's see, 
this was 1943, and she had got gasoline from

02:41.795 --> 02:51.109
somewhere. I had a footlocker, and on the way to 
Gerald's house when he dropped off, I wouldn't let

02:51.149 --> 02:56.496
my parents drive us up. I had to go to somebody else. 
That was a big shock. We stopped on the way to get my

02:59.861 --> 03:07.673
first razor and shaving brush and soap because I'd 
always used my father's up to then. I didn't need it

03:07.693 --> 03:10.637
very badly, but I had to have one. So we stopped on 
the way to his house, and then his parents drove us

03:10.972 --> 03:13.897
up. Dropped me somewhere on the campus because 
either she couldn't, wouldn't, or I didn't want

03:14.798 --> 03:21.510
her to drive me closer. Somehow or other, I got the 
footlocker up to old dorm 17. I'm not even sure what

03:25.617 --> 03:29.042
the name of it is today. And that was in the, quote, 
new dorm area? Yes. Describe the campus

03:33.530 --> 03:36.675
physically when you arrived. What buildings were 
there and where were they? Very dusty, very poor

03:39.367 --> 03:44.792
landscaping, walked anywhere we wanted to, no 
grass. The academic building, administration

03:45.753 --> 03:56.923
building, mechanical engineering shops and 
building, electrical engineering building, at

03:45.753 --> 03:56.923
least what I remember those buildings to be. Ross 
Hall, what they now call a trigun, I forgot what it

03:57.684 --> 04:05.211
was used for at that purpose then. The Aggieland 
Inn was there. I had been there a couple of times.

04:09.534 --> 04:18.085
But I think that's really where I got dropped off, 
as a matter of fact, at the Aggieland Inn, which, as

04:09.534 --> 04:18.085
you know, was across from the Savisa Dining Hall. 
Savisa was there. Duncan was there. Guyon Hall was

04:21.169 --> 04:24.614
there. The old Wooden Assembly Hall was there. 
Ross,

04:27.237 --> 04:34.827
Puryear, Goodwin, Law. Guyon?

04:39.110 --> 04:41.493
Guyon Hall, but then there's another dormitory. I 
can't remember. Right near the new area.

04:47.419 --> 04:49.522
Individual ramps building, I can't remember. 
Now, all of the new, quote, new dorm area and

04:49.542 --> 04:53.386
Duncan, they were... Yes. The old post office was 
there in the... I guess the Sabisa lived in a

04:59.630 --> 05:10.302
similar dormitory near the mail post office. The 
President's original home and another wooden

05:11.523 --> 05:18.451
building. I forgot what it was used for then, but it 
turned in to be where the WordPress was, the

05:18.471 --> 05:24.357
boardroom. That was it. You're right. Describe, 
you got there during the war, describe the student

05:27.102 --> 05:32.549
body when you arrived. We had approximately 900 in 
our class. Some of our class had started in

05:38.156 --> 05:48.869
January, I started in June, actually in the end of 
May, really two days or a week before I actually

05:38.156 --> 05:48.869
graduated high school. And we had a total of about 
1,900 to 2,000 total students that were various

05:48.889 --> 05:56.198
ages, We thought the so-called sophomores and 
juniors were old because they were 19 and 20 years

05:56.819 --> 06:02.244
old. Why they were still there, I don't know. We had 
approximately 2,000 or so of the ASTP people there

06:05.067 --> 06:16.377
and some naval cadre, but I don't remember what 
they were there for or how many. Where were those

06:16.398 --> 06:19.320
military active duty personnel living? ASTP, at 
least one group that I remember was I think it was

06:25.372 --> 06:30.118
Mitchell Hall, near Ross Hall. In the Navy, and I 
think some of the others in the Navy and some of the

06:31.400 --> 06:45.637
other ASTPs had the so-called,

06:31.400 --> 06:45.637
was that the new area near Duncan, the Duncan area 
dormitories? Well, what was the relationship

06:45.657 --> 06:51.885
between you Aggies and those active duty 
personnel. Well, there are several Aggies there

06:53.424 --> 07:04.397
in the ASDP people, one of which I knew from a child, 
as a child, from Galveston, Leon Dreyfus. We had

07:05.338 --> 07:08.381
very little to do with them, very little anything. 
The Navy V-12 participated in all kinds of student

07:08.762 --> 07:18.793
activities at the University of Texas, but the 
ASDP couldn't do anything except go to class in

07:08.762 --> 07:18.793
A&M. I don't know why. Were their classes held in 
the same buildings as yours? I think there were

07:22.664 --> 07:26.548
some in the same buildings, but I don't know that we 
had any in our class. I think, well, they wouldn't

07:26.848 --> 07:30.431
have had, because we were freshmen and they were 
juniors. No, but there were officially freshmen,

07:31.252 --> 07:35.836
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Yeah, there 
were a few seniors, probably four out, I assume.

07:39.539 --> 07:42.742
And was it a trimester system? Yes. We had three 
semesters, trimester system. What was it like to

07:50.253 --> 07:52.657
be a fish then? It really wasn't all that 
difficult. And that's probably a story, too. But

08:00.572 --> 08:05.782
of course, there wasn't supposed to be any hazing. 
The first semester I was there, we had no

08:05.822 --> 08:10.651
upperclassmen living in the dormitories with us. 
So the only time that we had We formed in military

08:13.338 --> 08:20.484
units, but we had freshmen who acted as cadet 
officers, although they had no official rank. So

08:21.485 --> 08:27.150
the only time we had a lot of intercourse with the 
upperclassmen was two in front of the mess hall.

08:28.651 --> 08:35.818
And we got stopped occasionally on the way back 
from Sabisa to the dormitories because Walton was

08:28.651 --> 08:35.818
a dormitory I couldn't think of. We had to walk in 
front of Walton. And we got stopped there in

08:38.600 --> 08:43.024
discussions at various times. Who taught y'all, 
who instructed you fish in Aggie traditions,

08:43.375 --> 08:49.384
lingo, et cetera? Unfortunately, I don't think 
anybody did directly as far as I was concerned. I

08:54.472 --> 08:55.493
did have some good friends. I thought they were 
good friends. There was some hazing involved.

09:02.965 --> 09:11.037
Probably one of the two best friends I had were then 
sophomores, and they found uses for a broom other

09:02.965 --> 09:11.037
than sweeping floors. All right, you mentioned 
such matters. Describe what hazing, and we'll put

09:13.611 --> 09:20.058
that in quotation marks, what hazing was then. As 
far as I was concerned,

09:20.619 --> 09:27.426
I'll tell it and maybe I'll ask you to take it out 
later. But maybe because of the upperclassmen

09:28.427 --> 09:38.138
that I knew who were the first ones to use the broom 
as a weapon in a sense,

09:40.480 --> 09:44.786
Maybe because of them, or maybe because it was me, 
maybe because nobody cared. I don't know, but I

09:46.168 --> 09:49.592
really didn't have a lot of other hazing. All 
right. And this was using a broomstick? No. On a

09:53.638 --> 09:54.559
posterior? It was not. The broomstick was the 
handle. The straw itself was used as the bower. Oh,

10:02.309 --> 10:02.990
oh. So they hit you on the rump with the broom. Yes, 
with the straw of the broom. OK. Was this pretty

10:09.691 --> 10:11.813
well everybody? I think so. And how many licks 
would somebody get? Well, so-called warm-up to

10:16.318 --> 10:23.024
get you accustomed to the sound and the positions 
and all that. Then it was only three. And this would

10:25.787 --> 10:29.210
happen, when it did happen, where and when? In the 
corridors of Walton Hall. And at night or day?

10:34.235 --> 10:35.817
Mostly in after supper. Describe a typical, as a 
freshman, take me through a typical weekday of

10:36.826 --> 10:49.357
drills and classes and whatever. As far as I was 
concerned, thinking back, we weren't supposed to

10:49.558 --> 10:54.109
have campaign hats. We weren't going to wear them, 
although the bookstore found a way to get rid of all

10:54.933 --> 11:01.960
they couldn't sell by selling them to the 
freshmen. So we had them, and yet we found out later

11:01.980 --> 11:05.845
we couldn't wear them. We also had coveralls, and 
we dressed in uniforms and went to class. By what

11:12.632 --> 11:13.593
time did you get out? I guess it was 6 o'clock. There 
was reveling? Yes. Did you fall out and march to? I

11:22.062 --> 11:23.303
fell out and marched to the That's a piece of the 
breakfast. We only had one small section, but

11:25.602 --> 11:32.968
because there were so few of us, probably half of 
the building. I guess there was some in the small

11:32.988 --> 11:39.514
section upstairs and then some down in the 
basement level.

11:39.974 --> 11:41.396
We had air raids somehow or other. We were taught 
what an air raid was. I don't know how we knew, but we

11:42.877 --> 11:47.561
knew maybe from the movie we'd never been licked. 
And then we'd go back, clean up, go to class, come

11:48.182 --> 11:52.986
back for lunch. back to dorm and then go to class 
again. You were in class, classes began at 8? 8

12:00.375 --> 12:00.816
o'clock. We had classes five and a half days a week 
through noon on Saturday. There was PE and drill of

12:07.425 --> 12:14.556
course in the afternoons and we probably got 
through 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoons most days.

12:15.738 --> 12:17.360
Saturday we had classes 8 to 12. Right. You fell out 
for the evening meal. We had a retreat and then

12:21.873 --> 12:28.300
marched to Sevesa and then after dinner we just 
drifted.

12:31.103 --> 12:31.944
Define drifting. We'd just go to the post office, 
you'd go back to the dorm, some of the other

12:32.084 --> 12:41.053
classmen might meet you.

12:41.213 --> 12:44.897
Just do nothing I guess for a while before CQ. Then 
CQ was normally? I don't remember but I guess. 7.30

12:49.987 --> 12:52.910
maybe to 10, 7 to 10. And lights were out at about? 
About 10.

12:59.036 --> 13:05.682
And was it unusual for somebody to go out after 
hours out of the dorm? If it was, I didn't know about

13:06.763 --> 13:07.985
it. I'm sure a lot of them did it because Northgate 
was so convenient. Let's see. I was a good boy. I was

13:15.472 --> 13:16.333
16 years old. I didn't know what I was doing. Oh, you 
were 16? I was 16 in February. Do you remember what

13:20.807 --> 13:24.634
your course load was beginning? Well, including 
military science, 18, 19 hours at least. I don't

13:30.504 --> 13:30.865
know. It could have been 20, but I don't remember. 
When you arrived, you assumed that you were going

13:33.670 --> 13:42.285
to finish your degree if you weren't called to 
active duty in how many years? Two years. I'd say

13:45.218 --> 13:47.121
two years, I guess in nine months. And you assumed 
you were going to major in? Aeronautical

13:50.085 --> 13:51.086
engineering. Why? Because my friend from San, 
well then, now from San Antonio, then from Houston

13:52.087 --> 13:58.956
was in there and I didn't know anything else to do. I 
didn't have any idea what any other courses were so

14:00.478 --> 14:05.625
I just took it. I'd also taken private flying 
lessons when I was in high school. I was in, I got

14:09.890 --> 14:25.793
permission to sell my clarinet and take $50 that I 
sold it for and buy, I don't know, five or six hours

14:09.890 --> 14:25.793
of flying time and a Piper J-3, 65 horsepower 
engine. Did you stay with that major? Yes. I stayed

14:30.180 --> 14:35.307
with it because when I got back I needed three 
semesters to graduate and anything else would

14:30.180 --> 14:35.307
have taken more. Let's stay with dormitory and 
life and so forth. You all used Aggie slang and

14:41.951 --> 14:44.494
lingo. Help me remember some of the chow hall 
slang. Oh, wow.

14:54.609 --> 14:56.011
Gunwhiting was bread. Grease was butter. Blood 
was ketchup.

15:03.122 --> 15:04.163
Sand was salt.

15:07.670 --> 15:08.751
Pepper. I don't remember what pepper was. Tea. 
Mustard. I don't remember what tea and mustard

15:13.175 --> 15:15.578
were offhand. Beans.

15:20.342 --> 15:23.245
I can't think of them right now. Let's see. My bull 
neck was beef, meat, of any kind. And dessert. Oh,

15:30.432 --> 15:31.132
kush. Now, did kush sometimes come through the 
mail? if your mom sent you some? I guess she sent me

15:40.504 --> 15:41.866
some. I'm not sure I remember that. I do remember 
that I kept a record of my cash expenditures and

15:43.849 --> 15:49.576
sent it home. And to the extent that I even put, I was 
playing with a friend of mine at an arcade one time

15:51.258 --> 15:59.308
shooting, what do they call it? Pinball machines. 
And I put 15 cents. and the pinball machine. I even

16:05.556 --> 16:07.038
put that on my expenditure. That was three cents 
for stamps. Do you remember what your total

16:08.620 --> 16:13.626
expenditure was for that period? For that 
particular period, it was $20, $25, I guess, for

16:13.646 --> 16:19.514
the six months, I don't know, three months, I don't 
know. While we're on, do you remember what the

16:19.534 --> 16:23.500
first semester cost was? Seemed to me like it was 
$125, I think, for room and board. Maybe another

16:33.344 --> 16:38.489
$1,500

16:33.344 --> 16:38.489
for books and stuff. What about uniforms were 
provided? Uniforms were provided, well, mostly.

16:43.974 --> 16:52.662
I did have some extra khaki uniforms that I'd worn 
in the high school junior civil air patrol that I

16:43.974 --> 16:52.662
was involved in at that time. How often did you wear 
civilian clothes in College Station? Never.

16:57.787 --> 17:01.090
Until I got to be, came back from service, I guess. 
Let's see, back to meal time. Describe some of the

17:04.527 --> 17:08.011
rituals at meal time. Well, if there was an 
upperclassman at our table, which I guess didn't

17:09.914 --> 17:22.670
happen very often in the first semester, in the 
second semester we did have, we had to serve them

17:09.914 --> 17:22.670
first. And if there's any shortage, we had to 
scrounge it from another table for them. dessert

17:30.365 --> 17:37.132
we ate the first year, but the second semester, 
first semester, the second semester, if there was

17:30.365 --> 17:37.132
any left we got it. We could eat it. Being a good 
Jewish boy, I never will forget I told my mother

17:40.576 --> 17:53.249
that the food was good, but I didn't know what, I 
knew what roast beef was, but we had some white

17:40.576 --> 17:53.249
stuff that was, tasted like roast beef, but I 
didn't know what it was. She later told me it was

17:54.290 --> 17:56.052
pork roast. And I guess I never had it before, but I 
sure enjoyed it then. All right, now, please help

18:00.848 --> 18:09.359
me on that and let me apologize in advance for 
mistakes of etiquette I may make. Help me

18:10.300 --> 18:18.070
understand and help all of us understand Jewish 
student being at A&M at that time. Well, there are

18:18.851 --> 18:20.133
very few of us. My guess is, I don't know about the 
first but probably in later years it got to be maybe

18:25.765 --> 18:31.219
100 to 150. I've always felt it was like a quarter of 
1% of the student body were Jewish at that time. We

18:40.008 --> 18:47.597
did have a Hillel organization headed first by 
Mrs. Esther Tottenhouse, whose husband was a

18:40.008 --> 18:47.597
professor. Can you spell that? 
T-A-U-B-E-N-H-A-U-S-E, I believe. And he

18:52.443 --> 18:53.024
taught? I think he, yeah. Do you know what he 
taught? No, I can't remember. Where did those

18:57.689 --> 19:01.133
activities occur, the Hillel? I only went once or 
twice, and it was somewhere, again, in the

19:01.374 --> 19:07.882
residential area at Southgate. Southgate, okay. 
And later on, Shirley Reiser, whose husband was

19:09.320 --> 19:14.448
Ray. R-E-I-S-E-R, I think. Took over after Mrs. 
Tottenhouse. I guess she retired and got too old.

19:24.482 --> 19:25.244
Maybe she passed away. But

19:25.304 --> 19:36.340
except for the fact that I heard many, many years 
later, after I graduated, that there were some

19:25.304 --> 19:36.340
other organizations that were on the campus, 
unofficial organizations, one of which I, TTs and

19:37.282 --> 19:54.568
whether it stood for lots of things, but you've 
probably heard it before, but the Tough Texans or

19:37.282 --> 19:54.568
maybe a few other things, to the best of my 
knowledge, there weren't any Jewish boys

19:37.282 --> 19:54.568
involved in that, although there could have been. 
I just never know. I wasn't. Whether it was because

19:57.172 --> 20:03.221
of being Jewish or just nobody had interest in me, I 
don't know. All right. Was there anything that you

20:05.075 --> 20:12.689
remember that made you feel uncomfortable or was 
there anything done or said? I don't ever remember

20:12.709 --> 20:18.699
anything being done or said in those years at all. 
Were you all called by any kind of nickname? No.

20:24.169 --> 20:25.952
Fish Maltz like everybody else was. We did not have 
to wear a white stripe. They banned that because of

20:28.735 --> 20:31.018
the military. We did not walk in the streets 
because they didn't want us to. The only thing I can

20:36.966 --> 20:39.008
tell you. And

20:39.028 --> 20:46.197
first semester, having no upperclassmen, we 
didn't do any details for any. Well, that's not

20:46.217 --> 20:47.339
true. As we were caught sometimes on the way back 
from dinner, we were given certain things to do. It

20:54.603 --> 20:55.824
was very erratic. It was sporadic. We talked about 
a typical day. Describe a typical weekend other

21:00.009 --> 21:03.933
than football season. What did y'all, what was 
that like? The first semester I guess I came home a

21:06.155 --> 21:09.779
lot. I don't

21:09.799 --> 21:15.184
know. I don't remember going anywhere else except 
on football weekends. Thanks to Loop Hot we had

21:19.889 --> 21:23.513
various means of transportation. Explain that, 
and largely. Lou Pott, God bless him, would

21:26.787 --> 21:50.884
arrange for buses where he got, not buses, but 
trucks to take us to the Dallas, Fort Worth,

21:26.787 --> 21:50.884
Austin, Houston for the court trips, and we paid 
him some fee for going on his trucks, some of which

21:26.787 --> 21:50.884
were furniture vans with no ventilation and stuff 
to sit in. Some were open with some hay, open body

21:51.404 --> 21:55.572
with hay. I mean, I don't know. That was probably as 
much hazing as ever went on, driving to and from and

21:57.876 --> 22:04.750
those things, because he mixed everybody up. And 
the fee, was it low or high? My guess, it was low,

22:10.661 --> 22:14.408
about $2 or $3 a person round trip, I suspect. I 
don't remember it being anything unusual, but I'm

22:15.333 --> 22:23.100
sure he made money on it because of the numbers of 
people he piled on. He also hitchhiked a lot. In

22:24.822 --> 22:26.744
those days, that was a... Describe Aggie 
hitchhiking. Aggie hitchhiking was difficult.

22:29.806 --> 22:33.830
He had specified places which you could start 
from. Where? Well, at the East Gate near the...

22:35.452 --> 22:40.837
What do you call the... Granite? That's granite. 
It's... entrance preparation as a grant. I don't

22:47.000 --> 22:48.743
know, sandstone or something anyway. That's 
where we started from going south and we started

22:49.324 --> 23:06.417
outside of the highway on Highway 6 and outside of 
Bryan going north and only if you were way deep in

22:49.324 --> 23:06.417
line or desperate did you take a ride in Abasota or 
Hearn. Or if you're going to Huntsville, out of

23:07.122 --> 23:15.777
Bryan, would you go to anywhere but non-stop to 
Huntsville? And when you're hitchhiking to

23:15.797 --> 23:24.331
Houston, normally how long would it take to get a 
ride to Houston? It didn't seem like it'd take very

23:24.351 --> 23:25.794
long. And it seemed like there were a lot of people 
going back and forth. Of course, we always had to

23:29.363 --> 23:32.728
introduce ourselves. We weren't supposed to go to 
sleep. And I'll tell you a quick sideline to that.

23:38.176 --> 23:52.258
On the way to LSU, Baton Rouge for a football game, 
my then roommate, and I guess we were sophomores at

23:38.176 --> 23:52.258
the time, we took a ride to Lake Charles, which we 
weren't supposed to do. And it got raining. It was

23:54.361 --> 23:55.202
raining. And so we went inside the Edelwein, and it 
was nighttime. We had gotten a ride to Houston. My

24:00.357 --> 24:09.927
mother and dad took us to the outside highway to go 
to, let's see, it was Highway 90 out of Houston. And

24:09.947 --> 24:11.709
we started there with them. And we got a ride late. 
It was maybe 7, 8 o'clock, 9, whatever it was at

24:12.830 --> 24:16.134
night. But we got to Lake Charles. We went in, had 
something to eat and a drink. And I guess we were

24:22.261 --> 24:25.324
maybe 17. We sat there for a while and put a stop 
light and went back out the highway to get a ride to

24:26.080 --> 24:30.367
Baton Rouge. We get a ride, and the man has his 
heater on. Of course, coming out of a hot building

24:35.256 --> 24:42.107
and damp, cold, and having had a drink, we got 
sleepy and weren't supposed to, and we fell

24:35.256 --> 24:42.107
asleep. And he asked us afterwards, We weren't 
supposed to stay awake. We said, yes. He said, you

24:50.185 --> 24:51.967
weren't supposed to drink either, were you? I 
said, drink? He introduced himself as a minister

24:54.550 --> 24:58.634
from some congregation. That story, I don't think 
he'll forget. Do you remember any negative

25:03.920 --> 25:07.043
hitchhiking? Oh, yes. One night we hitched, one 
day weekend, a friend of mine, we hitchhiked to

25:09.726 --> 25:13.190
Huntsville. For some reason, the girls didn't 
want to go out with us. So we had something to eat and

25:18.190 --> 25:22.154
went back from Huntsville. We took a ride to 
Madisonville and then trying to get over to

25:22.174 --> 25:25.397
College Station. And we got there and we thought it 
was the last picture show in town. Nobody was going

25:31.042 --> 25:33.564
to college, to Bryant. We couldn't get a ride. We 
stayed out until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. And

25:38.529 --> 25:44.294
finally ended up going to sleep on a bench in a hotel 
there until about 6 the next morning. Then we got a

25:44.994 --> 25:47.877
ride on a gasoline truck. and managed to get there 
the next day. We didn't get home very quickly. All

25:54.150 --> 25:56.803
right, did you or any of your friends ever have 
anything unfortunate happened to you much on that

25:57.931 --> 26:00.795
trip? Not as I recall. I haven't heard any bad 
stories. I haven't gotten a single one yet. I've

26:05.381 --> 26:06.422
never heard a negative story. Being in uniform was 
always, at that time anyway, everybody was

26:06.803 --> 26:11.509
willing to help. Even those who didn't recognize 
A&M uniforms. And I gather that you, that nobody

26:13.912 --> 26:19.139
held up a sign that said Houston or Dallas. No, we 
always used a phone. That you put up. I don't know

26:21.242 --> 26:25.508
that we didn't have a sign at some point out there. 
Particularly, I guess, if we were going to Baton

26:26.180 --> 26:30.304
Rouge, which we probably did. But I don't think it 
was ever necessary going to Houston or Dallas.

26:34.888 --> 26:37.170
Tell me about your outfit, your core outfit. Well, 
the first semester was all freshmen. We had... Did

26:39.552 --> 26:43.296
it have a name and a nickname?

26:46.138 --> 26:47.620
Not at that time, no. The first semester was Darm 
17. I don't think we had a guide on even that I

26:50.222 --> 26:53.385
recall. But they were all freshmen. They just took 
some people with high school ROTC experiences,

26:55.559 --> 27:01.605
so-called cadet officers. As far as you know, was 
that true for all of the undergraduate student

27:02.846 --> 27:06.910
body? In that summer of 1943, yes. Well, all the 
freshmen. When the fall began. When the fall

27:13.496 --> 27:19.121
began, then they moved some sophomores and 
juniors in with us. And what were you all called

27:19.662 --> 27:21.904
then, or do you know? This company, as I recall, I 
don't remember. What you're then, I hadn't

27:27.797 --> 27:41.013
thought about this, what you're alerting me to is 
that in the middle of the war, some of the core unit

27:27.797 --> 27:41.013
traditions were kind of gone. They were gone 
because we didn't have any designation, no milito

27:41.033 --> 27:49.123
brass that we wore designated

27:51.466 --> 27:53.268
I think we could wear anything we wanted to. I don't 
remember. So you weren't then identified as Field

27:54.991 --> 27:59.476
Artillery, Signal Corps, Infantry? Was there a 
Corps Commander? Yes. Okay, so that continued.

28:05.404 --> 28:11.832
Yeah, I can show you probably the Cook Hall 
Longhorn when we get to the house tonight. Maybe we

28:11.852 --> 28:13.875
can look some of that up. Let's see.

28:18.128 --> 28:22.232
Tell me about some of your special, special 
friends from those early years. Dwayne Bennett

28:23.433 --> 28:25.495
has remained a friend. And I saw him even overseas 
while we were in service. We ran into each other at

28:30.019 --> 28:31.921
the muster in 1946. L.M.

28:35.645 --> 28:37.767
Gabert was from Houston. And of course, I saw him 
often there as well as at the same muster in 1946.

28:46.630 --> 28:49.013
That's a good story, too. Go ahead. Who else? 
Special friends was, as far as freshmen were

28:52.277 --> 28:59.667
concerned, Frank Looney was my roommate. He had a 
date for our freshman ball. I didn't have a date. I

29:04.554 --> 29:09.460
went out and we bought some whiskey, which we 
weren't supposed to have, and I forgot who I was

29:04.554 --> 29:09.460
with. But I know I must have had at least two drinks, 
but probably that's all it took, and I got just

29:10.201 --> 29:16.249
sick. But not until I got in the upper bunk, and not 
until I had... I eventually gave it up into his

29:22.829 --> 29:32.465
shoes, and he came in sometime later that night and 
didn't stay, and came back the next morning and

29:22.829 --> 29:32.465
said, it's your problem, you clean them up. Which, 
of course, I did. Also,

29:34.448 --> 29:43.283
the first day I was on the campus, we went across the 
hall to a room with Dwayne Bennett

29:47.617 --> 29:49.760
Why would a guy end up in a paratrooper's anyway? 
There must have been more than how many people in

29:50.280 --> 29:52.563
there. Everybody's smoking and I didn't smoke. 
But of course I had to try one during I got sick then

29:55.046 --> 30:04.198
also and I didn't smoke a cent. Alright, share with 
me if you will some of the jokes, pranks, good bull

30:04.218 --> 30:12.308
of your student days. involving you or anyone 
else? RM-17 was known as SS-17 in our first

30:15.059 --> 30:19.263
semester. SS? Yeah. We were a steamship because 
there was so much, I mean, drowned outs going on and

30:21.025 --> 30:33.476
so many people turned on the fire extinguishers 
which were on the fourth floor, flooded the

30:21.025 --> 30:33.476
building. We thought it was, we thought it was 
going to float away. I didn't have a little, I had a

30:36.159 --> 30:40.843
first lieutenant in the cavalry who was our What 
did we call him? Not a military officer. Anyway, he

30:45.750 --> 30:52.018
was the officer in charge of our dorm and he got his 
boots soaked one time and didn't like it at all.

30:52.258 --> 30:53.961
Jock Burns was his, we called him. His name was 
Lieutenant Burns is all I recall. As far as the

30:58.827 --> 31:01.990
other... How did, how was a drowned out done? How 
did y'all do that? He had a bucket of water and he'd

31:04.433 --> 31:08.198
run in quick and block his door so he couldn't get 
out. with a broomstick or he'd lean one against his

31:08.667 --> 31:14.021
door so that if he opened it, it would float. I guess 
that was it. It never happened to me. And again, I

31:21.341 --> 31:23.607
don't know whether that was the reason. This never 
happened.
