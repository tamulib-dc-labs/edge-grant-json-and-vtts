WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:04.604
Okay, let's just, you want to just talk? Well, I'll 
tell you the first story. Did you grow up here in

00:09.490 --> 00:10.892
Rockdale? Huh? Did you grow up here in Rockdale? 
Yeah, I was born in Schulenburg, and my daddy

00:13.635 --> 00:19.242
moved, we moved to Rockdale when I was two years 
old. Two years old? Two years old, and I've been

00:20.404 --> 00:24.329
here in Milam County ever since. Have you enjoyed 
it? I guess so.

00:29.776 --> 00:31.438
Everybody that ever lived up here And you'll be 
eighty? Eighty-one? I'll be twenty-fifth of this

00:34.315 --> 00:37.460
September, I'll be eighty-one. Okay. This coming 
September. But the startin' of it is, my daddy's

00:40.585 --> 00:47.175
from over there, he's from Germany. My daddy and 
mother come from Germany. Do you remember what

00:49.398 --> 00:52.362
part of Germany? Well, my daddy come from Bulgaria 
and my mother come from Austria. Okay. And that was

00:57.050 --> 00:59.333
when they Oh, long years ago when they'd take them 
four or five maybe a month to come across on these

01:00.224 --> 01:07.934
slow boats, ships. And I had four sisters and one 
brother, and I'm the only one that's left.

01:18.649 --> 01:22.214
How'd you get along with four sisters? Well, they 
was all older. See, I'm the youngest one of them.

01:25.198 --> 01:26.559
They was all older than me. My brother Frank, he up. 
He worked around there, but he was grown. I'd run

01:33.150 --> 01:42.462
around them Mexican boys and went swimming in all 
them damn places, and I learned how to talk, but I

01:33.150 --> 01:42.462
didn't get no education. You can go out there and 
you can see me talking to a Mexican, you can't tell

01:43.543 --> 01:49.991
me from a Mexican. And a lot of people said, God 
damn, Willie. And I'd go out there and hold a

01:52.754 --> 01:56.979
conversation with them, just like me and you'd be 
talking. So you learned Spanish pretty young? Oh,

01:59.590 --> 02:01.271
yeah, I learned when I was a kid. I'd grown up with 
them. I got tickled over that when I went over to the

02:03.874 --> 02:06.636
temple. I had two young Mexican doctors, and they 
examined me over there, and they got to talking.

02:12.741 --> 02:16.465
They walked over, and I told them, I said, they left 
the first part of 17. That got me out of the sea. I was

02:19.107 --> 02:24.491
supposed to go to the Army, but they let me off on 
account of my wife. I had three kids. So you worked

02:26.753 --> 02:28.635
in the mine during World War I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Did... See, I went to work down there when I was 16

02:32.223 --> 02:36.748
years old. I was working under my daddy on the 
outside on top. We wasn't paying 15, 20 cents an

02:43.276 --> 02:45.838
hour. That's all we were getting them days. That's 
all you were getting? Yeah. What were the Mexicans

02:49.082 --> 02:50.824
getting in there? Well, they were getting so much, 
they were getting two bits of... They hold from 18

02:54.708 --> 02:56.590
to 20 tons. 18 to 20... I don't know what you call it, 
but they had a brass check. Brass tag. Brass tag,

03:06.421 --> 03:09.266
and they put their tag every time they get one 
loaded. The mule and the mule driver would come and

03:09.967 --> 03:20.565
put them out, and when they went over there, they'd 
get their tag, and they'd note how many you got and

03:09.967 --> 03:20.565
how many you... Each man had a different number. 
Right, right. But did they make more a day than you

03:22.295 --> 03:25.178
did working up top? Well, it was according to how 
they felt about it. Some of that lignite was pretty

03:27.922 --> 03:31.205
hard and some was pretty hard, soft. They'd make 
all the way from $3 to $4. If they made $4 a day, that

03:35.290 --> 03:38.814
was good money them days. How much did you make a day 
about? When I was getting, when I went to work from

03:40.977 --> 03:50.648
down there, when I started running energy, 
because the wages went up, I started $75 a month,

03:40.977 --> 03:50.648
straight time. When I was running the engine, 
that's what they paid me. Did you work all year

03:53.886 --> 03:56.649
long, or was it a seasonal time? No, I worked all 
year long. There'd come a time where they'd have to

03:59.593 --> 04:06.442
lay off some of them, but me and I was the head of the 
running engine. See, they usually have water and

04:06.483 --> 04:10.087
stuff in their mind, and they had these steam 
pumps. And I worked sometimes. I worked seven days

04:12.290 --> 04:15.775
a week, nine, ten hours a day.

04:19.585 --> 04:27.634
When the war was going on, the Second World War, 
man, they were doing pretty good business. Dr.

04:27.654 --> 04:36.524
Sparks told me that he made, he said, little 
Willie, I said, I cleared $30,000 during the war.

04:37.285 --> 04:38.686
That's World War I? Yeah. And after he died, well, 
everything began to go down. Well, did they have

04:45.274 --> 04:49.238
teams or gangs that worked together in the mines, 
or? No, they all worked separate. Individual?

04:54.384 --> 04:56.246
Yeah, individual. They weren't no such a thing as a 
union or something. A man or something get killed,

04:59.368 --> 05:07.135
they just feed his wife three or four months, give 
her groceries, paid her long till she got somebody

04:59.368 --> 05:07.135
else. They never did. Did they sing in the mines at 
all, or, you know, sometimes you read about old

05:09.697 --> 05:15.442
mining stories up in Virginia. Oh, they done 
everything around them gold mines. Oh, did they?

05:18.484 --> 05:18.604
Yeah. Like what? We used to get out on Sunday 
morning, they used to give me 50 cents a dollar an

05:20.048 --> 05:27.575
hour to watch them so they could gamble. They'd put 
me up in one of them outfits, pay me, see the law come

05:28.796 --> 05:34.061
and tip them off. They lose a lot of money that way, I 
guess, on gambling either way. They had it made,

05:40.227 --> 05:41.748
though, after that. They had a pretty good law that 
you can throw it on your damn knees to catch you. So

05:48.820 --> 05:50.963
Dr. Barclay was a doctor out there. Dr. Barclay? 
Dr. Barclay. You know him? Barclay or Barclay? Dr.

05:56.349 --> 05:57.150
Barclay. Barclay. Barclay. He's dead now. He's a 
doctor. So Dr. Sparks paid him.

06:04.759 --> 06:07.963
A single man would pay 50 cents a week. And he paid 
the doctors. He'd take it off our wages and pay the

06:13.650 --> 06:16.093
doctor. Then if he called us, it didn't cost us 
nothing. I see. Only when a woman had a kid or

06:20.610 --> 06:23.493
something, we'd pay $10 extra. I see. He hired him. 
He was a coal mine doctor. He'd had them little

06:28.859 --> 06:30.221
cars. He had a little Ford automobile in. He'd come 
out there in his Model D and he'd doctor us. Did you

06:38.209 --> 06:39.931
ever get hurt while you were mining? Well, there 
was an explosion. There was one barter blowed up

06:42.894 --> 06:44.776
over there. That was at the Kiroga mine. And I got a 
car up there now where the wall exploded and there

06:47.140 --> 06:58.291
was four of us around it, but we was lucky that 
didn't one of us get killed. Were you around in 1913

06:59.492 --> 07:06.099
when the mine shaft caved in and the seven people 
were... Yes sir, I was there. I can show you a man

07:07.300 --> 07:12.625
right now that wasn't but 12 or 13 years old. But 
he's nearly gone now. He's pretty sick. He lives in

07:16.342 --> 07:17.223
town. Is that Jose Morales? Yeah. Is he still 
alive? He's still alive, but they say he's just

07:20.848 --> 07:22.990
about gone. I heard the other day that he was in a bad 
shape. His wife died here about two years ago. Oh,

07:27.015 --> 07:27.816
I'm sorry to hear that. He's in a bad shape now, too, 
and he ain't even as old as I am. No, he's only about

07:31.621 --> 07:33.804
79, I think. Because he was trapped down there for 
six months. Yeah, he was down here, him and his

07:38.569 --> 07:40.492
brother and his daddy. Mm-hmm. There was three of 
the families down in there. And they all got out?

07:45.137 --> 07:48.661
Yeah.

07:48.681 --> 07:52.306
There was eight of them down there, and this 
fella... You see, they were... Them coal mines run

07:52.446 --> 07:54.929
like the land runs. That lead... In them mines 
that... Maybe they'll be going downhill one time

07:57.091 --> 08:01.797
and up the hill the next. Just like... They come 
down the side. So these fellas, some way or

08:03.820 --> 08:06.743
another, they got... When it caved in, they must 
have got air from where the water went in, you see.

08:12.222 --> 08:13.724
It was in a creek-like. That's where the water went 
in, and they were above where the water didn't get

08:14.385 --> 08:21.833
to them, and they got air through the hole that 
caved in. Because all down there in the shaft, it

08:22.414 --> 08:29.001
was 80 foot deep, and it was half full of water in 
there. One old man, he went back to get his clothes,

08:29.201 --> 08:34.387
and he laid down there, and the water got around 
him. Of course, he couldn't get no breath. It

08:35.889 --> 08:37.270
killed him. Did you help dig them out? Well, I was 
down there. They made little shafts like a well.

08:46.225 --> 08:49.408
They got their work day and night and taking time 
about till they got over there. They surveyed

08:50.289 --> 08:54.754
these places off, you know, so you know where your 
land is. And they went down taking them, I think

08:55.876 --> 09:02.363
nearly seven days to get down where them fellas 
was. Yeah, there was a mule down there with them.

09:09.028 --> 09:12.653
They went to clean it up because that mule said he 
got on all fours. It was full of mud, you know, that

09:13.835 --> 09:15.978
washed in there. Said they got close to that mule 
and that old mule got snorted at him and wanted out

09:16.659 --> 09:21.486
so bad. That mule had to stay in there. That mule 
stayed in there nearly two months. But they got

09:27.334 --> 09:28.856
food to him, you see. They got the men out through 
that hole, but they couldn't get the man out. But

09:32.414 --> 09:36.377
you take them that long, you know, to clear the mud 
and stuff up that was in the shaft. Did they take the

09:38.119 --> 09:40.040
mules in and out of the mines? Yeah, they put them in 
every morning and take them out every evening.

09:42.823 --> 09:43.143
Okay. Somebody had told me up in Milano today that 
they just left the mules down there. No, they never

09:48.428 --> 09:49.368
did. They always put them down every morning. I'd 
run the engine down there and lay down seven mules

09:51.991 --> 09:54.893
in the morning. She said we worked nine, ten hours 
them days. I see.

10:05.303 --> 10:08.666
Well, you said that you lived in one of those mining 
shacks for a while. Was this before you were

10:08.686 --> 10:09.947
married? Oh yeah, I was raised out there. See, I 
lived out there in one of them old... See, they

10:14.251 --> 10:19.276
built these little plank huts. Maybe a room or two. 
And they had these stoves in there, a cook stove. We

10:26.022 --> 10:27.023
used wood. And the coal mining owners would give us 
the... In the wintertime, we'd have these hot

10:31.166 --> 10:34.129
heaters. that we'd use that lignite in these 
heaters and cut, use wood. They'd give us the wood.

10:40.545 --> 10:45.070
There wasn't no such thing as electricity or 
nothing like that out there them days. No gas, no

10:45.531 --> 10:47.253
electricity, nothing. But we had to live on just 
what we had to make. So you lived right there with

10:52.358 --> 10:54.280
the Mexican families? Yeah, I lived right next 
door to them. What were they like? They were good,

10:59.125 --> 11:00.767
I'll tell you one thing. If they liked it, they'd do 
anything in the world for you. Sometimes one of

11:04.889 --> 11:07.632
them would get sick or something, we'd all 
collect. Of course, we wasn't able to give them

11:07.652 --> 11:09.114
much. One of them would get sick, we'd all put 50, 60 
cents, maybe a dollar in there for him to go to the

11:10.075 --> 11:16.762
hospital or something like that. One of them died, 
we'd all collect money to buy, have his funeral

11:16.862 --> 11:21.067
fixed. I was out there, my wife was operated in 23, 
and they made up 150 dollars. asking them, them

11:32.125 --> 11:35.468
that didn't have money, they brought grocers up 
there. We was all good about that. Well, did they

11:39.473 --> 11:43.036
cook inside their shacks or did they cook outside? 
No, I tell you, they'd go down there in the morning

11:43.177 --> 11:48.862
and the wives would cook the dinner, bring it, and 
we'd let it down to them. Oh, I see. They cooked in

11:50.064 --> 11:51.385
their little houses. Nearly all of them had wives.

11:56.510 --> 12:01.736
And all about 1130, they'd start bringing their, 
they'd have these little dinner buckets. Mm-hmm.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.405
They'd fix them dadgum tortillas and beans and 
stuff. Well, did you go to school when you were

12:08.548 --> 12:11.032
growing up out there? Well, when I went to Top of the 
Ridge, we had to walk about three miles, but I

12:11.152 --> 12:15.699
played hooky so damn much. It wasn't going, and I 
never got no education. Well, I understand that

12:22.909 --> 12:25.172
the Mexicans had their own schools. Oh, yeah, they 
had their Gussie Vogel, the one he was talking

12:25.933 --> 12:28.898
about. She taught them out there for a long time. 
The Mexicans had their extra school. They didn't

12:33.990 --> 12:36.533
go to white school. So I guess he was the one who 
taught them English. He taught them English.

12:43.944 --> 12:46.928
Where did most of the Mexicans come from? Do you 
know where most of the Mexicans came from? They

12:49.151 --> 12:49.692
are. I tell you, they'd get together and go to 
Laredo, and they'd get permission to bring a bunch

12:49.992 --> 12:57.723
of them across. Permission from whom? From Mexico 
to come across. Did they get permission from the

13:01.799 --> 13:04.383
United States government also? Yeah. See, they 
couldn't get no white people. Them days, you

13:09.731 --> 13:12.295
couldn't get nobody. All the white people was 
farming and working on these farms, and they'd get

13:13.036 --> 13:19.486
a bunch of these mess kids in here. What about 
blacks? Did the Negroes work down the mines pretty

13:22.811 --> 13:26.296
much? Who? The black people? Well, there was quite 
a few but they all lived in town. They never lived at

13:30.320 --> 13:31.761
them coal mines. They'd go, they'd walk back and 
forth. But they did work in the mines? Yeah, they

13:35.445 --> 13:35.845
did work. Sometimes four or five in one place. But 
there was mostly Mexican. Seemed like Mexican

13:43.011 --> 13:45.573
went to that more than anything else. Do you have 
any idea why that was the case? I don't know. They

13:49.417 --> 13:49.817
are. They, they, they, they do pretty good on that. 
Say, we'd come to town, we got dogs, we'd It was sad.

13:58.027 --> 14:04.653
They had down the streets a big crowd of people that 
you couldn't quite understand around.

14:04.673 --> 14:08.137
What kind of, what did the Mexicans do for 
entertainment? Oh, they had these, it was the 5th

14:08.597 --> 14:11.880
of May. They had a big, the company built them a big 
outfit, a big civilian-like, and they'd have an

14:12.861 --> 14:19.327
entertainment. 16th of September is when they'd 
celebrate, and 5th of May, boy, they'd just have a

14:19.347 --> 14:24.151
hell of a time. They'd all get together. They all 
play music? Yeah, they had the Mexican music,

14:28.167 --> 14:33.612
guitar and accordion and fiddle. Was there very 
much give and take between the people at the mines

14:34.854 --> 14:43.362
and the people in town in Rockville, or was it just 
on weekends? It was just on weekends.

14:48.287 --> 14:53.633
They were all busy working through the week, all 
the way through the week, very seldom. They got

14:54.608 --> 14:56.931
pretty bad after the war was over. It got kind of 
bad, and they didn't work but one or two days a week.

15:01.796 --> 15:04.299
And they'd lay off and try to catch some of them 
else. They'd take a bunch of kids, you know, and

15:04.819 --> 15:07.622
they'd miss them. Days they didn't work, they'd go 
out and these farmers would come after them, pick

15:07.642 --> 15:13.188
the cotton them days. They had about three or four 
gins in Rockdale. They had to oil them in with gin,

15:16.552 --> 15:19.075
you know. Could you make more money picking cotton 
than you could mining? Well, them that had a bunch

15:23.144 --> 15:25.267
of kids, they could. But the biggest part of them, 
you know, they'd get these, they'd have them

15:26.589 --> 15:38.147
little hack, because people would come after the 
men at work in the mines, and the women folks would

15:26.589 --> 15:38.147
take the kids, and they'd pick these farmers' 
cotton. They'd come get them and carry them back

15:38.267 --> 15:42.213
every evening. My wife's kid done the same thing 
after they got going. She weighed lots of cotton.

15:50.345 --> 15:51.126
How young? What was the youngest miner that you saw 
down in the mines? Well that... Did the companies

15:56.995 --> 16:00.238
have an age limit or...? They had these uh, you mean 
they owned the mine? Right. Well they was all old

16:04.943 --> 16:06.865
people. See Yoakum's was old. They had a little 
shaft mine over there. They was the first one to

16:12.050 --> 16:15.634
put, to put the mine down. The Yoakum's were? Yeah, 
old man Yoakum. Then it went from when old man Vogel

16:19.895 --> 16:25.021
come over here. He made a shaft mine down there. 
Slope mine, what you call it, you know. It started

16:29.926 --> 16:31.148
at the top and go down. He's the one that started it 
and then they got to put down these shaft mines

16:32.009 --> 16:36.914
straight. They'd have these elevators, you know. 
They had two drums. One of them go up and the other

16:41.219 --> 16:42.721
one go down. It'd be a double, it'd operate, you 
know. And everything that operated in them days

16:46.205 --> 16:49.328
were boilers and steam.

16:51.772 --> 17:01.122
At the same time over there, we had about 85 or 90 
messengers that were reloading from 25 to 15, 20

16:51.772 --> 17:01.122
flats a day. And they'd have a little old 
locomotive come out there and bring them to the

17:02.463 --> 17:09.311
empties, pull out the full ones. They had scales 
down here in Rockdale. They'd weigh it, whatever

17:11.052 --> 17:12.774
it is. Wherever they'd sell it, they'd distribute 
it out. There's trains that carry them out where

17:16.798 --> 17:19.281
they used it. oil mills used lignite then, and all 
these gins used lignite. It had lots of trucks come

17:25.443 --> 17:28.906
down and truck it out before it wasn't too far. 
They'd load these trucks and charge them so much a

17:29.807 --> 17:38.315
ton, and they'd deliver to these oil mills.

17:38.376 --> 17:41.559
How did the commissary system work? Did you get 
paid in cash, and did the Mexicans get paid in cash?

17:47.847 --> 17:50.391
When we first started, they paid cash. We had these 
old big silver dollars. Maybe they'd give you

17:52.213 --> 17:53.575
five, six of them. You'd have a pocket full of 
silver dollars. I mean, they was silver dollars,

17:55.157 --> 17:56.559
too. They paid you all cash. But after things got to 
tight over there, they went to these coal miners.

18:03.229 --> 18:04.530
Owners went to give them checks. You'd have to go to 
the bank. Go to the bank? Yeah, you'd buy the

18:08.015 --> 18:09.017
groceries. They'd sell you the groceries on 
credit, and they'd take it off your payday for

18:09.057 --> 18:15.025
whatever you got coming. And that was pretty 
reasonable with them groceries. But you never did

18:17.345 --> 18:20.308
work with what we call company script? No. You 
never did that?

18:25.715 --> 18:29.479
Do you think the mines were fairly safe, or were 
they pretty dangerous? Well, there's not as much

18:29.639 --> 18:37.468
of danger in these coal mines as it is up north, you 
know, where they have all these explosions and

18:29.639 --> 18:37.468
everything. If one would get killed, it would be 
just some rock or something fall on him. But first

18:43.535 --> 18:46.418
concerns come closing, a whole bunch of them. Now 
when that mine was filled with water, the M7,

18:46.458 --> 18:53.286
that's the only one that I ever know of that was 
trapped in the mine. And they got them alive, all

18:54.788 --> 18:56.650
out. Mr. Beathard said that one of her relatives, 
one of her friends, I forget which, was run over by a

18:57.190 --> 19:05.640
coal car one time. Yeah. Them several of them get 
killed over there. How would that happen? They

19:11.586 --> 19:12.968
just let them fall, or? Well, I tell you, they'd get 
in between them cars and sometimes downhill a

19:13.370 --> 19:18.618
little bit, and they didn't have no brakes on them. 
I tell you what, they'd make these little sticks

19:18.738 --> 19:21.662
about that long. And when you started downhill, 
they'd unhook the mule, stick two or three of them

19:22.864 --> 19:31.397
sticks in them wheels, and that'll lock them 
wheels. And he was down there looking, trying to

19:32.418 --> 19:38.367
get that and another bunch to run into, and that's 
what killed him. Did that happen very often? No.

19:42.209 --> 19:48.616
Let's see, in the time I was there, there wasn't but 
three Mexicans in the whole time I was there. And I

19:49.517 --> 19:52.039
was down near there all the time that mine was 
there. Which would be from what, about 1895? To

19:57.305 --> 19:58.406
what, 1935? Or did you work up through... Well, in 
1933,

19:59.227 --> 20:08.436
that's when they was, you know, all closing down. 
Was that due to the depression? That was over

20:10.822 --> 20:11.543
there. That's when I, in 36,

20:11.563 --> 20:21.555
when the one mine left, that gentleman there, 
that's what you call it, that old coffee loan's all

20:11.563 --> 20:21.555
back there now. He's the only one left. He finally 
had to take out when that calc fuel company in here,

20:23.197 --> 20:31.107
when they overloaded everything, had them 
shelves. So everything down this way had all these

20:31.767 --> 20:35.872
shag mines had to close up. I see. Well, how did the 
Depression affect you? I mean, you were a miner all

20:40.482 --> 20:42.765
your life. How did the Depression, you know, 1929, 
1930, affect you? Well, that was it. It was pretty

20:48.431 --> 20:49.552
good them days. You got along all right? Oh, heck 
yeah. You worked all the way through, huh? Yeah.

20:56.579 --> 20:57.981
So, what about the Mexican families? Did they 
work? Yeah, just like I tell you, when times would

20:59.703 --> 21:06.570
get bad, some days they wouldn't work until they 
would go away. They had these little old gardens.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.463
They'd raise little corn and stuff. They'd always 
have a little garden back behind the house. The

21:16.206 --> 21:18.108
company let them live there. If they wanted to go 
somewhere and work, they could live there. But

21:21.712 --> 21:27.217
when the mines started up again, they wanted them 
to come back. Would you say generally that the

21:27.237 --> 21:32.402
miners got along with the owners of the mine 
company? Oh, yeah. There were no labor problems or

21:33.964 --> 21:37.367
strikes or anything that you can remember? They 
never had no strike that I know of. Why do you think

21:40.792 --> 21:42.155
they worked? Well, they couldn't strike because 
they never did make enough money. They had to keep

21:44.398 --> 21:46.181
working. I see. I tell you, sometimes when they had 
them feces, like they was making pretty good

21:48.044 --> 21:54.755
money, they'd have them feces. Fifth of May or 16th 
of September, they'd need to lignite, and some of

21:54.795 --> 22:03.208
them would get drunk, lay off three or four days. 
Well, the owners didn't like that. And then it all

22:05.258 --> 22:07.661
was over. There wasn't anything you could do about 
it. They'd finally all come back, one or two at a

22:09.643 --> 22:13.268
time, and go back to work. But that's the only time 
they never did. They never had no strike. Well,

22:18.574 --> 22:22.559
they wasn't able to strike. There wasn't no union 
or anything. Nobody came down from the North to try

22:24.201 --> 22:31.971
to unionize?

22:31.991 --> 22:32.171
No. I noticed reading some of the history that the 
Peacocks clan sprung up again in the early 1920s.

22:38.838 --> 22:44.565
Did they bother the mines at all, or the people who 
worked at the mines?

22:50.013 --> 22:55.841
Did any of the Mexican miners go off to fight in 
World War I that you know of? They, they sort of took

22:55.861 --> 22:59.886
three or four of them. But the biggest part of them 
all, they'd come from Mexico and they wasn't

23:02.380 --> 23:09.587
American. Yeah, a bunch of them went, a bunch of 
these young boys that went, that their parents

23:11.008 --> 23:16.534
brought them over here. Yeah, they got a whole 
bunch of them young boys. Had they, the Mexicans

23:21.058 --> 23:28.145
that were brought over to mine, had they mined in 
Mexico before they came here? Well, they claimed

23:28.205 --> 23:30.447
there was mines in Mexico. But they didn't have 
much to do over there because they couldn't sell

23:31.422 --> 23:36.086
the coal. I see. Well, did it take skilled labor to 
mine the lignite mines? Well, they just used

23:42.611 --> 23:45.774
anybody that come along to steal labor. That's all 
they used. What kind of tools did they use? They

23:49.637 --> 23:51.879
used these big scoops and picks. That's all they 
used. Scoops would be a shovel? Shovel and a pick.

23:56.944 --> 23:59.846
They had each point on each side. They'd dig that 
coal. that the tunnel would be about four or five

24:01.392 --> 24:05.996
foot wide and six or seven foot high. And they just 
wouldn't dig the whole ding out because it would

24:06.757 --> 24:12.622
cave in on them. Maybe they'd go a little piece this 
way, turn it off over here, turn it off over there,

24:12.642 --> 24:18.167
turn it off over here. Sort of like the branches of 
the tree. Yeah, the branches over there. And when

24:21.590 --> 24:26.835
they'd get to the end of the land, then they'd go to 
work. They'd use this timber. Mm-hmm. They'd cut

24:30.097 --> 24:38.429
trees and brace it up, and just maybe sometime 
bigger than this house, they'd have it all sitting

24:30.097 --> 24:38.429
on timber, not nothing but the timber on it. And 
then it started to crack it and pop, and they knew

24:39.070 --> 24:42.815
what had happened. They'd back off before it'd 
fall in, then they'd start in again. Yeah, it

24:48.483 --> 24:51.247
worked out pretty nice. Well, did everybody seem 
to get along with everybody else? Well, once in a

24:54.031 --> 24:56.575
while they'd have a little fight or something. 
Didn't many of them, I don't know. There wasn't any

24:59.341 --> 25:01.444
racial problems? No, no. Them days you could get by 
with just anything. They'd have fights as long as

25:05.008 --> 25:08.593
they didn't kill one another, cut up one another. 
Oh, there was plenty of fights out there. What did

25:10.556 --> 25:11.417
they fight about? Did they fight over coal or did 
they fight over women? No, they didn't fight over

25:14.201 --> 25:15.422
coal. You'd get drunk and fight each other. Just to 
be fighting? Yeah, they didn't ever fight over the

25:19.087 --> 25:24.915
job or nothing. Was there ever a time when you 
weren't mining yourself? When you weren't

25:28.585 --> 25:31.088
working at the Mines, were you ever a farmer? No, I 
never did farm. See, my daddy brought me, I raised

25:34.592 --> 25:37.576
them coal mine, brought me. I was 16 years old when I 
went to work. I worked, I guess, until they closed

25:41.901 --> 25:45.085
up. And what did you do after that? Well, after 
that, after they closed up,

25:47.528 --> 25:56.680
I went to work for a fellow to move people, driving a 
truck. Moving company, huh? Mm-hmm. I worked for

25:59.062 --> 26:03.066
them two or three years, and then he got into bad 
shape. He had the TB, and he had to quit, and his wife

26:03.086 --> 26:06.989
got mad and hit him. Then I went to work for the city, 
and I worked for the city about eight years. And I

26:13.135 --> 26:14.696
got mad at them one day. That's when the alcohol 
come in here. That strip mine come in here. And I

26:21.863 --> 26:26.267
asked them for a raise. They wouldn't give me a 
raise. They wouldn't give me 75 cents an hour. So

26:31.736 --> 26:32.957
they wouldn't give me no raise. And I went to 36. I 
went to work for 37. I went to work strip mine. I'd

26:42.271 --> 26:44.495
get the alcohol where the alcohol was on. I went to 
work. I worked out there. In 36 to 48, that's when

26:47.940 --> 26:54.229
they had to close down and the alcohol come in here. 
The interpreter at the wedding? Yeah, and I

26:56.492 --> 26:59.075
interpreted four or five of them. And these were 
young fellas that did not learn English then?

27:03.320 --> 27:07.665
Yeah.

27:07.685 --> 27:09.367
You just picked up the Spanish on your own? No, I 
messed around with these kids, you know, coal

27:09.547 --> 27:15.915
miners, women owners. I just picked it up. Now, my 
brother got a good education, but he was already

27:17.436 --> 27:22.242
grown. He got to be formed down there in the old gold 
mine.

27:33.907 --> 27:38.233
I forget what year that was when that boiler 
exploded. That's when they, but they had steps

27:38.253 --> 27:45.723
that men could get out, you see that? Was that right 
at the turn of the century, wasn't it? Wasn't it

27:49.027 --> 27:50.389
right at the turn of the century? I don't know what 
year that was. That launch bar ought to know. I

27:56.172 --> 28:02.250
don't know if he

27:56.172 --> 28:02.250
knows or not. This tape is continued on the other 
side.
