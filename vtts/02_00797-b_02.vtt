WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.066
And Hampton number 86.

00:06.411 --> 00:07.353
Loves it. There's the big fella six five two 
hundred forty two pounds. What a football player

00:11.299 --> 00:15.305
is great quickness and very strong upper body. So 
he's he's in position to do his job just by standing

00:15.325 --> 00:24.739
there reacts to the ball as Curtis Dickey tries to 
go outside as nowhere city right out there. down

00:25.748 --> 00:53.595
nineteen seven with six thirty five to go third 
quarter the Yankees are going to go for it fourth

00:25.748 --> 00:53.595
down and three

00:25.748 --> 00:53.595
Mosley wants it quiet Vince Buckley says come on 
folks get the chance to hear the signals it's kind

00:25.748 --> 00:53.595
of a courageous tactical decision right here Vern 
I tell you they're barely inside hog territory and

00:25.748 --> 00:53.595
we still got a bunch of time left in this football 
game do you agree with the decision I'll tell you

00:25.748 --> 00:53.595
after they execute

00:54.790 --> 00:56.455
It's all right to do it away from home. Yeah, that's 
right. It's so much easier up here, isn't it? Yes.

01:00.326 --> 01:01.289
Fourth down and three. Mosley, pitch out. Dickey. 
Get outside. Close. Very, very close.

01:16.222 --> 01:17.023
This is basic. The basic power sweep out of the eye. 
Quick pitch. Lead around the corner. Kick out by

01:21.488 --> 01:22.649
the fullback. Didn't have to kick out. This is 
great speed. A guy can run a 6'1", 60. He can go for

01:27.014 --> 01:29.977
first downs around the corner. Now then, do you 
agree with the decision? If I had Curtis Dickey to

01:31.979 --> 01:34.923
throw the ball to, I do. Well, it worked. They got 
the first down. That's really a courageous

01:37.165 --> 01:40.729
decision by Tom Wilson. Dickey, 77 yards for the 
day. First down, Ted, at the 44-yard line. You

01:46.613 --> 01:53.922
cannot

01:46.613 --> 01:53.922
return the bubble. You cannot advance a bubble and 
hit the ground. Larry Jackson has it but he's just

01:56.746 --> 01:59.870
going for a stroll in the park. They're going to 
bring it all the way back to the forty three

01:59.910 --> 02:06.619
twenty might as well give it a whirl. Yeah if he were 
a freshman we might excuse him because in high

02:07.039 --> 02:11.625
school they can pick him up and run with him. So it's 
the same play the other way. The power toss outside

02:16.567 --> 02:19.530
a lot of penetration. But Curtis Dickey turns the 
corner. He's got the ball rather loosely there. He

02:23.615 --> 02:24.496
got to put it away. He's transferring from his 
right to his left hand. It got away from him. That

02:29.041 --> 02:32.425
was Marty Mitchum, number 56, the defensive end, 
who forced the fumble. It's first down 10

02:32.945 --> 02:34.307
Arkansas. Green almost offside. And off balance 
up near the 50. Jacob Green made the tackle. It's

02:42.624 --> 02:45.266
Cal Cagney rather, not Collins. And three 
turnovers for A&M now. Two fumble recoveries, or

02:46.788 --> 02:50.311
two fumbles lost, and one pass intercepted. Well, 
it let down after that very courageous decision to

02:51.192 --> 03:00.220
go for it on fourth and four, and then the next play 
to have a turnover, and a lot of the psychological

02:51.192 --> 03:00.220
advantage has been lost. Second down three at the 
49 of Texas A&M. Bold birth for one of these teams,

03:04.884 --> 03:07.447
for sure. Left side. handoff goes to Ben Collins 
gets close for the first down at the forty six

03:09.773 --> 03:22.197
Eugene Sanders number ninety six and Doug Carr 
number ninety three with the tackle it was seven

03:09.773 --> 03:22.197
nothing Texas A&M early in the game Turnover led to 
a touchdown. Arkansas tied it up 7-7. Ish Ordonez

03:26.308 --> 03:30.553
kicked two field goals in the second quarter to run 
the count to 13-7. And then a touchdown by the

03:30.593 --> 03:36.098
Razorbacks in the third quarter gives them the 
current 19-7 edge. Bobby Duckworth comes wide to

03:36.399 --> 03:41.063
the right side all the way off the field of play as a 
matter of fact. The double tight end set. Charles

03:42.185 --> 03:44.707
Clay and Tim Adams in the tight ends. Clay tight 
right. Cal Cagney keeping. Spinning down at the

03:47.410 --> 03:48.691
45. He got the first down 10. Doug Carr with the 
tackle. That's a pattern that's been repeated so

03:54.475 --> 03:57.438
often by Cal Cagney. His third and short are near 
the goal line. He's not going to pitch the

03:59.160 --> 04:00.661
football. Now you have to come out if you ruin your 
jersey. New rule in college football this year.

04:04.965 --> 04:07.728
You must come out if you have the tearaway jersey 
torn away. So Kevin Scanlon is on a quarterback.

04:10.531 --> 04:12.813
Scanlon, number 14, was in for one play earlier. 
Transferred from North Carolina State. He is from

04:15.496 --> 04:17.257
Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. He's a junior. And he 
holds all of Joe Namath's old high school records

04:17.938 --> 04:22.963
at that school. Pitch out right side. Michael 
Forrest take a look at Jacob Green and say hello.

04:29.335 --> 04:29.875
Number 77.

04:35.060 --> 04:42.587
You know Vern talking about those tearaway 
jerseys some people say well he should have had a

04:35.060 --> 04:42.587
tearaway on when he gets sacked right here. But 
this is so typical a defensive line for the Aggies.

04:45.250 --> 04:52.697
It makes it deep penetration in their moves and 
make a little slant move penetrate the gaps and

04:45.250 --> 04:52.697
then get those losses on their stats. Second down 
15 back at midfield at the 50-yard line with 3.54 to

04:52.947 --> 04:57.733
go third quarter. Cal Cagney back in there. Good 
block left side on Eddie Heath. He's going deep. Up

05:02.399 --> 05:03.821
in the air for Gary Stiggers. Almost intercepted.

05:07.726 --> 05:10.230
Kenneth Taylor, who has two interceptions this 
year. The last one against SMU a couple of weeks

05:10.290 --> 05:13.915
back. And Gary Stiggers with 9.7 speed. Down that 
far sideline. It'll be third down and 15. Often

05:20.487 --> 05:25.533
said, Vern, that one of the most exciting things in 
college football is the long incomplete. And that

05:25.574 --> 05:26.375
shows it. There's a lot of tension here. Good pass 
defense. Good position. Good body position.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.683
Almost a great play. Was a great play. It's third 
down 15. Two wide receivers wide left. Bobby

05:37.509 --> 05:39.451
Duckworth and Donnie Bobo. Cal Cagney looking 
that direction. Fires short. One hopper to Bobby

05:42.776 --> 05:44.638
Duckworth. at the thirty-five yard line. So Ron 
Calcagne will come over to the bench and Bruce

05:47.054 --> 05:50.760
Leahy comes on to punt. Calcagne for the day now six 
out of fifteen for sixty-six yards. And Adger

05:56.108 --> 05:58.492
Armstrong will go back to receive the punt. So 
Arkansas for the first time today unable to

05:58.512 --> 06:02.679
convert the turnover into a score. There are two 
touchdowns. Both follow turnovers. Adger

06:07.026 --> 06:09.089
Armstrong waits for Leahy's punt. Left footed 
kicker. Great kick. Super kick. He takes it. No

06:15.341 --> 06:19.428
fair catch.

06:25.459 --> 06:26.741
A forty-four yard kick. One yard on the return. 
Three minutes, thirty-two seconds remaining

06:28.644 --> 06:30.888
third quarter. Arkansas leads nineteen to seven. 
1962 graduate of Corsicana High School. 1966

06:37.030 --> 06:40.756
graduate of Texas Tech where he was an 
all-conference quarterback. The head coach at

06:40.776 --> 06:42.799
A&M, Tom Wilson. His team first down 10. Hand off. 
David Brothers out across the 10 to the 11-yard

06:44.983 --> 06:47.647
line. They have miles and miles to go before they 
get back in it. Other scores around the country

06:51.633 --> 06:53.356
this afternoon. Michigan over Purdue at 
halftime. 17-0. Big one coming up for the

06:56.421 --> 06:58.123
Wolverines. Ohio State next week. Notre Dame 
leading Georgia Tech by 17 in the second quarter.

07:03.377 --> 07:05.942
Pittsburgh has taken a lead over Army by seven. 
Second quarter score. And Syracuse on top of

07:07.465 --> 07:09.950
Boston College now, 21-7. It's second down, 
seven. Texas A&M at the 11-yard line. 19-7, they

07:15.440 --> 07:17.063
are trailing. Mosley pitches out to Dickey, comes 
left, gets a block from brothers up near the 15.

07:22.794 --> 07:24.796
He'll be three yards short of the first down. Mike 
Massey made the tackle number 48. Continue to

07:28.379 --> 07:30.962
update you on other scores from around the 
country. Holy Cross over Rutgers 14-10 in the

07:31.402 --> 07:34.445
second quarter. Colgate leading Delaware by two. 
Second quarter score and Mississippi over

07:37.929 --> 07:41.432
Tennessee 10-7 in the second. Florida State leads 
Navy 17-6 third quarter. And South Carolina over

07:47.738 --> 07:50.321
Wake Forest 14 nothing. Second quarter score. 
Ohio State Indiana got a brief glimpse of that.

07:54.507 --> 07:55.508
It's third down and three. 7-7 Ohio State Indiana. 
Here's Mosley on the roll. Going right. Being

08:00.454 --> 08:01.615
chased. Pulls up. Let's it go. No good. Vaughn must 
be defending.

08:12.578 --> 08:19.706
We've got a great shot of the rollout pass that Mike 
Mosley rolls to his right into the strength of the

08:12.578 --> 08:19.706
hog defense zone. He's pressured deep has to 
really roll deeper than he wanted to it and that

08:19.726 --> 08:24.631
slowed up the timing. He delivers the ball 
accurately but the timing was a little late so we

08:24.651 --> 08:29.737
don't get the inbounds catch. Nice effort by Doug 
Teague on that far side but it did not did not count.

08:35.603 --> 08:36.524
What's the pressure. David Appleby. Are they 
coming. Not this time. Appleby pretty good kick.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.502
Vaughn Lesby waits for it at the thirty nine. Good 
downfield coverage. But Lesby gets away from one.

08:47.866 --> 08:49.247
Can't get away from the second.

08:52.150 --> 08:59.718
And Arkansas gets it back after that forty six yard 
punt.

08:59.738 --> 09:01.159
They've got the return on. And so they they hold up 
the punt coverage team. And Lesby does a good job of

09:05.423 --> 09:08.326
feeling the ball. But the defense recovers. He 
does not get away from them. Vaughn Lesby. And it's

09:15.793 --> 09:18.878
first down 10 Arkansas at the 35 yard line. 19-7 
Razorbacks lead. Split backfield. Cal Cagney

09:23.767 --> 09:26.412
pitches back to Ben Cowens. He gets a great block 
but a nice defensive play by Kenneth Taylor off of

09:26.452 --> 09:33.685
that block and they force Cowens wide left. He gets 
up to the 40 yard line. coming up Monday night a

09:35.401 --> 10:04.463
dandy Monday night football game the Miami 
Dolphins eight and three visit the Houston Oilers

09:35.401 --> 10:04.463
and the Oilers having one of their best seasons 
they're seven and four with Earl Campbell a

09:35.401 --> 10:04.463
Heisman Trophy winner of a year ago in the 
backfield Miami of course features Delvin

09:35.401 --> 10:04.463
Williams one of the great running backs and 
that'll be Monday night over most of these

09:35.401 --> 10:04.463
stations and of course this afternoon following 
the completion of our game USC and Southern Cal USC

09:35.401 --> 10:04.463
and Southern Cal not quite UCLA and Southern Cal 
yeah I don't think they'll play it that way. Here's

10:06.209 --> 10:07.570
Cal Cagney right side. Caught after a gain of one by 
Doug Carr. Number ninety-three. It'll be third

10:10.834 --> 10:12.035
down four. One forty-three to go. Third quarter. I 
think the Aggies changed up their base defense

10:15.439 --> 10:18.002
that time. They're keying on Cal Cagney because 
he's the player who has really hurt them. One of the

10:23.148 --> 10:27.032
fifty-four thousand who are here in Razorback 
Stadium. And a hornet just flew into our broadcast

10:28.694 --> 10:30.876
booth. Trying to tell you something. I know it. 
Keep away from that fella. on the third down effort

10:36.286 --> 11:06.023
Michael Forrest with the ball but caught short and 
Bruce Leahy will come on to

10:36.286 --> 11:06.023
play as Bruce Leahy who has done a good job this 
afternoon as he ever and we will have funeral

10:36.286 --> 11:06.023
services for the Hornet here at the end of three 
quarters of play the Hornets gone folks Fair catch

11:06.458 --> 11:09.041
at your Armstrong 16 yard line. The Green Hornet 
has been struck. Glad to see that fella go south.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.350
I'll tell you a 40 yard punt. Forty nine seconds to 
go. Third quarter. Nineteen seven. Arkansas

11:22.578 --> 11:25.161
leads it and the Aggies have been unable to move.

11:28.666 --> 11:29.867
Here in the third quarter. Well, we've got 
USC-UCLA this afternoon and a tremendous weekend

11:30.438 --> 11:34.983
of college football next week. Pittsburgh-Penn 
State live Friday afternoon, 1 o'clock Eastern

11:35.003 --> 11:38.508
time. And two more games on Saturday that we'll 
talk about here shortly. Here's Mosley back to

11:42.232 --> 11:43.574
throw. Across the middle, tight end. McKeska 
can't hang on to this one. Looked like he was a

11:47.138 --> 11:51.163
little off balance.

11:51.724 --> 11:54.006
Mosley now four out of nine. For the year, or for the 
day. And there's Tom Wilson once again. He and his

11:57.731 --> 11:58.852
wife, Dawn. Let's go, Connor! parents of two 
children was on the staff at Texas Tech for eight

11:59.800 --> 12:26.128
years up until nineteen seventy four and then went 
to A&M as the offensive coordinator

11:59.800 --> 12:26.128
it's second down and ten draw play Dickey nice play 
defensively by Dale White number eighty seven

11:59.800 --> 12:26.128
because Dickey I think saw a lot of room and thought 
he might go for a bunch It'll be scary. Anytime he

12:27.450 --> 12:31.375
gets the ball and gets the line of scrimmage, you 
think he could pop it all away. Could well be the

12:32.316 --> 12:34.459
last play of the third quarter now. Mike Mosley, 
sophomore quarterback.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.187
20 seconds to go. 19-7. Third and seven at the 20. 
Mosley, four out of nine for 57 yards. Draw play,

12:50.699 --> 12:52.001
Dickey. Try to get outside. Jackson chases. 
Dickey may have the first down. Larry Jackson

12:56.602 --> 13:08.772
caught up with him number 66 but Dickie did indeed 
keep the drive going with the first down 10 and the

12:56.602 --> 13:08.772
clock stops on the first down play with two seconds 
remaining in the third quarter. Tom Wilson did a

13:11.198 --> 13:14.544
great job there, I think, at calling that play. He 
repeated the play to a good running back, and he

13:14.624 --> 13:19.732
made the first down. That's the end of the third 
quarter with the score Arkansas 19-7. Back for

13:23.619 --> 13:29.509
fourth quarter action after this message and a 
word from our local stations. Picks up six. Vern

13:30.691 --> 13:33.696
Lundquist and Ben Martin, former Air Force 
Academy head coach. as some changes have been made

13:34.604 --> 13:36.927
in the offensive line. Third quarter stats, Ben. 
Oh, that tells it all because Arkansas definitely

13:38.549 --> 13:43.696
has been dominating since the first 15 minutes. 
And first downs and yardage, total yardage,

13:43.796 --> 13:48.662
keeping the ball on them. Turnover's the key. 
Three turnovers for Texas A&M. Arkansas has

13:52.948 --> 13:54.790
played flawless football. High formation on 
second down. Hand off, Dickey. Caught behind the

13:57.654 --> 13:59.917
line and dropped. Dale White, the nose guard. 
21-year-old senior from Benton, Arkansas,

14:01.139 --> 14:04.543
number 87. It will be third down, seven. and the 
cadets are four out of ten on third down

14:10.700 --> 14:38.800
conversions have not had all that much success 
largely due to those 11 guys you're looking at

14:10.700 --> 14:38.800
right there arkansas turns their nose guard loose 
a lot whether it be white or if it be a jimmy walker

14:10.700 --> 14:38.800
there's the master of the one-liners lou holtz 
amateur magician and uh very funny fella arkansas

14:10.700 --> 14:38.800
head coach here's mosley back to throw pops it out 
for his tight end mckeska 40 45 first down 10 at the

14:10.700 --> 14:38.800
47 yard line Russell McKeska. Not used as much of a 
receiver until the change into the I formation.

14:48.257 --> 14:57.249
Take a real good look at the basic tight end 
crossing underneath against the flow as Mosley

14:48.257 --> 14:57.249
goes left plants and throws back in his tight end. 
Russ McKeska coming across underneath the grain.

14:59.873 --> 15:01.435
He fooled the linebackers completely. First down 
ten at the forty seven. Arkansas defensing that

15:05.965 --> 15:09.891
high formation of Texas A&M. Mosley going left. 
Being chased now by Dan Hampton and gets around him

15:11.794 --> 15:18.665
up and out of bounds into the A&M bench in Arkansas 
country. Jerry Saxton, the defensive end number

15:18.725 --> 15:22.171
47, chased him over there. Mosley did not start 
last year as a freshman until the final two games of

15:24.314 --> 15:28.080
the year. David Walker was the starting 
quarterback. But he was named offensive player of

15:30.637 --> 15:37.927
the game in the televised game that the Aggies had 
against Houston last year. And he was also our

15:38.348 --> 15:42.294
offensive player of the game two weeks ago against 
SMU. And Ben and I will be selecting the

15:42.354 --> 15:47.942
outstanding offensive and defensive players 
here before the ball game is over for Chevrolet.

15:48.482 --> 15:50.045
Second down, Mosley, draw play. Dickey, left 
side. Close for the first down at the 42. Jerry

15:54.131 --> 15:55.773
Saxton again made the tackle. And Curtis Dickey is 
closing in on a 100-yard day. Curtis Dickey he can

16:00.303 --> 16:29.196
do it all this kind of play out of the affirmation 
it's really built for his ability to explode gets

16:00.303 --> 16:29.196
the ball on a delay play finds a crack of daylight 
and then really accelerates through that

16:00.303 --> 16:29.196
daylight to get some very vital yardage he's now 
picked up ninety four yards on twenty three

16:00.303 --> 16:29.196
carries and got the first down ten at the forty two 
thirteen thirty four to go in the ballgame really

16:00.303 --> 16:29.196
vital for them to get something in and get it on the 
board they really do burn or it's all over And of

16:31.235 --> 16:33.199
course bowl representatives are here. The 
invites can go out at six o'clock local time

16:33.300 --> 16:36.006
tonight. Mosley back in trouble being chased by 
Jerry Jim Howard and caught by Jim Howard. Six to

16:43.623 --> 16:46.830
defensive end a junior from Denver Colorado.

16:51.063 --> 17:00.297
Defense is really fired up, and they can sense the 
momentum going against them, and they're going to

16:51.063 --> 17:00.297
make something happen as they really get a quick 
rush into that backfield. They felt it was going to

17:00.317 --> 17:05.245
be a pass play, so they kind of laid their ears back 
and went after it. Jimmy Walker on a blitz move to

17:05.305 --> 17:07.508
the inside. He picks up three blockers, and that 
allows Howard to get loose and make the loss.

17:12.696 --> 17:13.938
Second down and 20. Mosley 5 out of 10 for 75.

17:19.345 --> 17:27.118
Carter left side they fake the draw play rolling to 
his right goes deep across the middle catch Joe

17:19.345 --> 17:27.118
Carter first down thirty one. Carter with his 
first catch of the day six to one hundred sixty

17:28.119 --> 17:44.205
eight pound junior for Brian Texas got a little 
misdirection in the backfield comes off a sprint

17:28.119 --> 17:44.205
draw counter play rolls no penetration this time 
has a lot of time to hit the crossing man that's a

17:28.119 --> 17:44.205
fine leaping catch by Carter. as he came from his 
split position far side of the field they rolled

17:44.185 --> 18:08.775
into the short side this is a tough throw back 
against the grain a leaping catch that's what they

17:44.185 --> 18:08.775
need to do first down 10 at the 31 of Arkansas A&M 
with his most sustained drive in the second half

17:44.185 --> 18:08.775
Curtis Dickey caught up the line and dropped Jimmy 
Walker all-conference player the last two years

17:44.185 --> 18:08.775
defensive tackle number 75 Not a big guy, really. 
Six foot, 232 pounds. He is so quick and he's so low

18:12.778 --> 18:17.265
to the ground, he just explodes off that line. He 
doesn't do much in a way of reading the blocking

18:17.285 --> 18:20.389
pattern. He attacks the line of scrimmage as a 
defensive player. McKeska goes tight to the right

18:24.555 --> 18:26.458
side. It is second down and nine. Texas A&M at the 
30-yard line of the Razorbacks. I set. Mosley

18:33.068 --> 18:34.430
back. Saxton had him. Walker gets it. 45-yard 
line. Jerry Sexton the junior number 47 got there

18:40.396 --> 18:48.060
first and then Jimmy Walker came in and said thanks 
for the help I'll take care of it from here on in.

18:48.209 --> 18:50.312
He's unbelievably quick, I'll tell you. What an 
aggressive defensive player. Reckless abandon.

18:54.178 --> 18:56.101
He just flings his body all over the place. He's 
very intense. He really wants to win the football

18:57.162 --> 18:59.226
game. Mike Mosley has now carried it nine times 
backwards for minus 26. Nine for minus 26 for the

19:04.794 --> 19:07.358
sophomore quarterback. It's third down 22 with 
11.42 to go in our ballgame. 19-7 Arkansas. Doug

19:14.549 --> 19:16.191
Teague, wide right. that Russ McCaskill is a very 
reliable pass catcher and when you're going into

19:16.711 --> 19:41.892
the throats of a prevention zone defense you're 
better off to run a crossing pattern after it's

19:16.711 --> 19:41.892
been cleared out by the men on that side and Russ 
McCaskill comes through five for ninety six he had

19:16.711 --> 19:41.892
six two weeks ago against A&M six the week before 
that against Rice he has become in the last three

19:16.711 --> 19:41.892
weeks the leading wide receiver the leading 
receiver timeout

19:42.715 --> 20:11.085
mostly couldn't hear the signals or couldn't call 
the signals his lineman and backs couldn't hear

19:42.715 --> 20:11.085
them you think you'll toss it to Dickie around the 
corner this time that's what we've been doing

19:42.715 --> 20:11.085
against that stack defense I'll tell you if I had a 
big six one two hundred five pound back with nine

19:42.715 --> 20:11.085
three speed I might be tempted to give it to him He's 
a reliable ball carry in a clutch situation. See

20:14.316 --> 20:15.778
what Tom Wilson has in mind. Fourth down one. 
Dickey is the deep back in the eye. That's David

20:19.483 --> 20:22.828
Brothers, number 32, you see short. Pitch out, 
Dickey. Coming right, cutting up. Oh, no. Jim

20:28.796 --> 20:39.170
Elliott, a sophomore, number 79, who had just come 
in the lineup, caught Curtis Dickey short of the

20:28.796 --> 20:39.170
first down.

20:39.190 --> 20:40.532
And they love it in Little Rock. It would appear 
that Arkansas had the same thought in mind that

20:41.609 --> 21:08.865
there was a number one guy and he's going to be 
tossed the ball but they got good penetration

20:41.609 --> 21:08.865
which is kind of the trademark of the Hodge defense 
14 plays they come up empty handed 14 play drive no

20:41.609 --> 21:08.865
points first down 10 Razorbacks eleven twenty to 
go in the ballgame nineteen seven Arkansas leads

20:41.609 --> 21:08.865
Cal Cagney one yard after the twenty five USC 
Southern Cal and UCLA will follow our game live

21:10.820 --> 21:25.806
from the West Coast after the scoreboard show 
Prudential College scoreboard at the conclusion

21:10.820 --> 21:25.806
of this game and then perhaps Florida A&M against 
Southern. So check the local listing for which

21:25.886 --> 21:29.913
game will be seen in your region of the country. 
It's second down seven. We got three on the last

21:33.820 --> 21:35.663
play instead of one. Cal Cagney, that counter lead 
option, will keep and gets to the 25-yard line.

21:41.842 --> 21:46.449
Eugene Sanders, number 96, made the stop on Ron Cal 
Cagney, the senior from Youngstown, Ohio. Not a

21:48.051 --> 21:48.973
large quarterback. There's Eugene Sanders, 
number 96, from New Orleans. Started out at the

21:51.156 --> 21:55.984
University of Washington and transferred down to 
Texas A&M. Sat out a year and has been a starter for

21:56.004 --> 22:00.551
three years at College Station. 6'3", 273 pounds. 
A huge hump. It's third down eight. See if Cal

22:07.103 --> 22:08.445
Cagney will throw. He will. Four-man rush. No 
blitz. They got him. Nailed him at the 16-yard

22:12.112 --> 22:13.694
line. James Zachary, the only member of the Texas 
A&M football team who was a part of the cadet corps

22:13.814 --> 22:21.708
at Texas A&M, made the tackle. And they were trying 
to throw that dinky delay to Jerry Eckwood coming

22:22.529 --> 22:30.523
out of the backfield, but the linebacker just 
locked right onto him, and Cal Cagney had no one to

22:22.529 --> 22:30.523
throw to. There's that your Armstrong once again 
he is not ordinarily the punt return specialist

22:31.060 --> 22:42.880
that belongs to Darryl Smith but Smith is not 
playing today because of a bruised shoulder lay a

22:31.060 --> 22:42.880
left footed kicker has had a good afternoon and 
this is not a bad kick either. Armstrong fumble

22:43.361 --> 22:55.903
I did not see a fair catch signal there was none in 
his own man backed into him which made it very

22:43.361 --> 22:55.903
difficult to say the least.

22:59.495 --> 23:00.917
They're going to have a conference about it. 
That's Bruce Sutherland number 46 who obviously

23:01.578 --> 23:16.358
can't believe what he's seeing

23:01.578 --> 23:16.358
personal foul interference with the opportunity 
to make a fair catch. I didn't see the signal Ben. I

23:18.020 --> 23:18.802
didn't either. But you have to raise your hand 
clearly above your head and wave it left to right.

23:24.950 --> 23:27.173
Did you see that.

23:29.178 --> 23:34.166
Or maybe he's just saying interference with the 
right to catch the ball. Even you have a you have a

23:34.447 --> 23:38.754
right to catch the ball even if you don't signal for 
a fair catch.

23:41.418 --> 23:47.608
There's no fair catch signal but he's got to be up 
above his head and waving left to right. I think

23:47.668 --> 23:53.177
that they interfere with his right to catch the 
ball which doesn't mean he had to have a fair catch

23:47.668 --> 23:53.177
signal going.

23:56.077 --> 24:21.747
first down 10 at the 40 yard line after the 15 yard 
penalty as they call in the hogs again you hear that

23:56.077 --> 24:21.747
noise Mr. Holtz is not too pleased on the sideline

23:56.077 --> 24:21.747
and there is a rumble in the stands that is not the 
calling the hogs there's Lou Lou Holtz not very

23:56.077 --> 24:21.747
pleased you don't see that penalty called very 
frequently first down 10 Raymond Belcher back in

24:23.431 --> 24:26.214
and pull back for the Aggies. Mosley draw play. 
Curtis Dickey. A tough one yard. Larry Jackson,

24:30.279 --> 24:31.700
number 66. Dan Hampton, number 86. And Jerry 
Sexton, number 47.

24:39.629 --> 24:40.250
Dickey with 90. There's Larry Jackson. 5'11", 210 
pounder. All-conference the last couple of

24:45.175 --> 24:46.637
years. Was a high school receiver, believe it or 
not. Second down and nine at the 40-yard line. 913

24:52.709 --> 24:54.672
remaining in the football game. Mosley, up in the 
pocket, in trouble, going left, nailed.

25:05.048 --> 25:09.836
William Hampton, senior from Forest City, 
Arkansas, number 82 with the containment. And it

25:09.856 --> 25:10.957
will be third down. Vern, I think an interesting 
thing about the Arkansas defense is that they get

25:11.598 --> 25:19.150
all that penetration and pressure on a passer 
without sending a linebacker. It's all the front

25:19.170 --> 25:21.113
three, four, five people. Think they haven't 
gotten Mike Mosley's running number today, huh?

25:24.698 --> 25:25.800
10 for minus 28. He's trying to roll out. Well, 
we'll see where Russ McKesker, the tight end,

25:29.005 --> 25:31.389
lines up. He is tight to the right side. High 
formation on third and 11 at the 43.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.745
Jimmy Walker chasing Mosley. Mosley at the 36.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.161
I think he probably was looking for Russ McKeska. 
Let's see what happened to Russell McKeska

25:49.182 --> 25:51.644
downfield. He definitely looks for him. Number 
81, Russ McKeska. He's a great target, runs very

25:54.568 --> 25:56.970
disciplined routes. He's running his underneath 
crossing pattern. But the linebackers make the

25:59.073 --> 26:03.578
deep, deep drop, and they're right all over his 
case. William Hampton, number 82, with the

26:04.259 --> 26:06.922
coverage. It is fourth down and five. Aggies are 
one out of two on fourth down conversions in the

26:10.706 --> 26:14.150
ballgame. Eight and a half to go in this one.

26:18.974 --> 26:20.176
Mosley coming right. Being chased. Pressured 
back. Safety blitz was on. Brad Schaaf, number 40,

26:23.942 --> 26:26.546
has him at the 42. Jim Howard picks it up. Brad 
Schaaf, senior from Carlisle, Arkansas, was

26:29.891 --> 26:36.541
coming on the safety blitz. And Arkansas takes 
over at the 40-yard line. You look at it from right

26:39.494 --> 26:41.397
on the turf. And what a great call. The first really 
blitzing move that the Hogs have made. And they

26:45.442 --> 26:47.645
picked the exact right time to do it. The wide side 
of the field. They came. Minus 23 yards. Mosley is

26:53.093 --> 26:55.896
minus 45 on 12 carries. Arkansas takes over.

27:01.164 --> 27:02.886
From New York to Chicago.
