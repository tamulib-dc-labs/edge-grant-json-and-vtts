WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:05.452
See if the microphone is working a second time.

00:05.613 --> 00:06.153
Now off.

00:08.577 --> 00:12.001
This is June the 9th.

00:12.522 --> 00:22.435
Sitting in the splendidly orderly living room at 8.03 Dexter with Carl Landis.

00:23.076 --> 00:26.901
Getting ready to chat with him about his years at Texas A&M.

00:27.321 --> 00:29.704
Now turn the machine off and see if it's working.

00:30.545 --> 00:30.986
Let's see.

00:31.126 --> 00:31.827
Carl...

00:32.262 --> 00:57.882
check about yours okay yes this is Carl Landis okay now we'll turn it off Carl L-A-N-D-I-S-S right and you said that you and your wife came here in 42 or were you single then no no George Bell and I had been married several years we had a little

00:58.165 --> 00:59.346
girl who was in the first grade.

01:00.387 --> 01:02.149
We came to A&M.

01:02.229 --> 01:07.193
I started teaching at A&M for the spring semester of 1942-43.

01:09.856 --> 01:11.457
So I came in February of 43.

01:12.658 --> 01:13.679
But there wasn't a place.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.882
College Station was very, very small.

01:17.763 --> 01:27.312
And we had five military units from the Army, from the Navy, and from the Air Force all on the campus.

01:27.832 --> 01:36.222
And they occupied, there were no apartments, not only an apartment in College Station, and there wasn't a place to bring the family down.

01:36.923 --> 01:42.189
It wasn't until just about the last of April that I was able to bring the family down.

01:43.931 --> 01:53.142
Now, Trace, give us a brief biological, biographical, I should say, summary of your life before that time.

01:53.162 --> 01:53.723
Before that time?

01:53.743 --> 01:55.285
Where did you grow up?

01:55.305 --> 01:55.845
Where did you go to school?

01:55.865 --> 01:57.147
Well, I was born in Tennessee.

01:57.667 --> 02:02.394
And I'll tell you one thing that's gonna, not very many people have this.

02:02.995 --> 02:09.705
A doctor came out from the county seat in a horse and buggy, 18 miles to deliver me.

02:10.687 --> 02:13.571
I had an older brother who was three years older, but he died at birth.

02:14.032 --> 02:17.277
So my dad had vowed that he would have a good doctor.

02:18.318 --> 02:24.788
And so then I started school in Tennessee, a one room log schoolhouse.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.621
And we talk about guns.

02:27.202 --> 02:29.445
Two of the older boys always brought guns to school.

02:30.146 --> 02:31.427
They hunt squirrels on the way home.

02:32.308 --> 02:38.376
They have fresh meat because there's no way to keep beef or something like that, fresh meat.

02:39.057 --> 02:45.705
And you could have pork, which was smoked and salted, but you couldn't keep fresh meat.

02:47.126 --> 02:50.531
And so I went to school there.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.513
Then my folks moved to Kansas City, Missouri.

02:53.303 --> 03:03.318
I went to school in Kansas City, Missouri, in the Finnish elementary school, high school, then went to Abilene Christian forâ€” Which high school in Kansas City?

03:03.760 --> 03:04.061
Central.

03:04.503 --> 03:04.663
Central.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.785
At that time, Kansas City was a segregated town.

03:09.288 --> 03:15.539
Then I started working in Kansas City during the summers as a playground instructor.

03:16.861 --> 03:24.475
From that, when we graduated from Abilene Christian, that was in 1935.

03:25.028 --> 03:31.515
Jobs were hard to come by, but I found a job at a little community of Sylvester, Texas.

03:32.576 --> 03:33.757
I don't think it's any longer there.

03:35.419 --> 03:41.565
There were 10 teachers, 14 teachers, 10 of us were brand new, never taught a day in our life.

03:41.585 --> 03:43.347
And I found out why at the end of the first month.

03:43.948 --> 03:49.493
In the first month, the high school principal who was distributing the checks gave me two pieces of paper.

03:49.994 --> 03:50.675
This isn't 35.

03:50.915 --> 03:52.977
And I said, why?

03:53.378 --> 03:55.261
Half the check was good.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.103
I could cash it.

03:56.483 --> 03:57.565
The other half was a voucher.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.446
There was no money there.

03:59.188 --> 04:02.072
So I knew why there were ten teachers, ten new teachers.

04:02.293 --> 04:07.361
What was your total income supposed to be if all of that had been good?

04:07.782 --> 04:09.044
Ninety dollars a month.

04:09.605 --> 04:09.885
Nine-oh.

04:10.226 --> 04:10.567
Ninety.

04:10.627 --> 04:13.251
Nine-oh.

04:13.271 --> 04:14.814
And you taught what courses?

04:15.415 --> 04:19.842
I was a principal of the high school, I mean of the junior high, of the elementary school.

04:20.648 --> 04:22.710
I taught the sixth and the seventh grade.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.471
They were in one room.

04:24.532 --> 04:31.239
And I taught math and history and geography and things like that.

04:31.639 --> 04:42.510
Then there was another teacher who came in and taught English and Texas history, because it was hard for me to pronounce cities like Waxahachie, Nacogdoches.

04:43.751 --> 04:48.316
But there was the cutest little homemaking teacher just right across the hall.

04:48.996 --> 04:50.638
I started teaching Texas history.

04:50.922 --> 04:58.290
And when I come to one of those names that I couldn't pronounce, I'd run across the hall and say, George Bell, how do you pronounce, what's this?

04:58.870 --> 05:01.833
And she'd tell me, I'd go back, you know, this is Nacogdoches.

05:02.954 --> 05:08.841
But anyway, I traded very quickly with the teacher and I taught her math and she taught Texas history.

05:09.982 --> 05:15.107
I was principal of the high school because the year of the elementary school, because the year before

05:16.572 --> 05:22.862
We had kids in the seventh grade who were 14, 15, 1, 16 years old.

05:23.884 --> 05:28.070
And the year before, they had sort of kind of run their principal off.

05:29.353 --> 05:31.476
I was just out of college and thought I was pretty tough.

05:32.958 --> 05:38.968
And finally, I was trying to be a kind of

05:40.433 --> 05:43.659
you know, the father to son, but I was much older than they were.

05:44.621 --> 05:46.584
And discipline got worse and worse.

05:47.245 --> 05:52.775
Finally, I decided that the next one that I had to crawl down, I was going to paddle.

05:52.795 --> 05:54.078
And you could paddle again legally.

05:54.518 --> 05:57.484
And I had the strap that met all the specifications.

05:58.365 --> 06:00.990
And so it was a 16-year-old boy.

06:00.970 --> 06:03.753
So I had a teacher come in and observe it.

06:04.594 --> 06:08.659
And he kind of flopped over the desk and with a smile on his face.

06:09.259 --> 06:12.223
But the first lick, that smile come off.

06:12.924 --> 06:14.485
On the third lick, he started crying.

06:15.226 --> 06:16.047
And then I eased up.

06:16.428 --> 06:21.193
But as soon as that was, as soon as he was through pedaling him, I put him outside on the playground.

06:22.114 --> 06:23.255
And all the kids got quiet.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.180
I didn't have too much discipline problems after that.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.261
It was a very enjoyable year.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.083
I met my wife at the first

06:30.552 --> 06:34.577
And the first faculty meeting was social before school started.

06:35.318 --> 06:40.043
And I saw a cute little gal over there, just a graduate of CIA.

06:41.044 --> 06:44.889
And so I walked her home, which was about a block away down the gravel street.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.352
And we sat in the porch swing out there.

06:47.372 --> 06:50.516
And I've walked her home every day since.

06:52.838 --> 06:54.180
All right, then from that.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.546
From that, I moved to Kansas City, Missouri.

06:56.586 --> 07:01.858
I got a job, I was offered a job in Kansas City, Missouri, teaching elementary physical education.

07:02.419 --> 07:08.673
And I had five schools and I made those in a week, one day a week.

07:09.435 --> 07:12.321
And then I showed teachers what to teach and they followed up on that.

07:13.988 --> 07:20.235
And then I moved to junior high school, and then the high school, and I got to A&M.

07:21.136 --> 07:30.447
My major prophet, Abilene Christian, was William Earl Dow, and he had joined the A&M faculty just the fall before.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.568
So what was his last name?

07:31.588 --> 07:33.110
Dow, D-O-W-E-L-L.

07:33.611 --> 07:35.473
Did you know him?

07:37.057 --> 07:37.918
I believe so.

07:37.938 --> 07:40.240
And he was my major professor at Abilene Christian.

07:40.760 --> 07:46.365
And so when an opening came up at mid-semester, he recommended me to Mr. Penberthy.

07:47.446 --> 07:56.734
And Mr. Penberthy called me one night, it was about four below in Kansas City, and offered me a job at A&M.

07:57.755 --> 07:59.237
So he hired me sight unseen.

08:00.237 --> 08:04.141
But anyway, that was in January.

08:04.181 --> 08:06.523
So when it came to the end of the semester when I could leave,

08:06.993 --> 08:12.078
Then I left and I came to A&M and been here ever since, except.

08:12.879 --> 08:15.241
I'm not going to ask you about compensation anymore.

08:15.722 --> 08:18.625
What was your beginning salary here?

08:21.428 --> 08:22.749
I believe it was $2,700 a year.

08:22.809 --> 08:25.812
All right, and so you were.

08:25.832 --> 08:27.634
That was 12 months because we worked 12 months.

08:27.954 --> 08:32.639
So you were on the faculty from 1942 until you were.

08:32.659 --> 08:35.802
No, 43, January, February of 43.

08:36.119 --> 08:37.281
until you retired?

08:37.821 --> 08:42.948
No, I took, at the end of the spring semester in 1944, I went to the Navy.

08:43.769 --> 08:49.317
We had a Navy unit on board on the campus, and Merle Dow and I had gone over and applied for a commission.

08:49.777 --> 08:51.059
We both received commissions.

08:51.820 --> 08:56.627
And so at the end of the spring semester at A&M, we left to go into the Navy.

08:58.089 --> 09:04.337
And then I came back to A&M in August of 46.

09:05.296 --> 09:06.157
I've been here ever since.

09:06.598 --> 09:07.519
When did you retire?

09:08.340 --> 09:11.204
I retired in August of, August 31st, 1979.

09:11.224 --> 09:14.149
79, okay.

09:14.709 --> 09:19.837
All right, let's go back now to that first arrival.

09:20.438 --> 09:28.569
Describe the campus and the community around it, if you recall it, when you, when you got here.

09:29.070 --> 09:33.396
All right, the campus, of course, was very small then.

09:33.747 --> 09:44.359
We had less than 4,000 students, but we had units of, as I said before, the Army, the Navy, and the Army Air Force, because it was Army Air Force then.

09:45.341 --> 09:54.692
And the department, our main objective was you were getting men ready to go into combat.

09:55.352 --> 09:56.734
That was the primary purpose.

09:57.322 --> 10:00.687
Everyone took physical education four hours a week.

10:01.368 --> 10:07.877
Fifth-year medical, I mean, fifth-year vet medicine students took physical, because everything was conditioning.

10:09.879 --> 10:16.989
Waiting for the, and the Air Force, they left here, the Air Force trainees, we had those too in our physical education program.

10:17.510 --> 10:20.835
They left here and went to San Antonio for flight school.

10:21.676 --> 10:24.780
Now, were these service units

10:25.435 --> 10:28.421
They were taking a physical education program.

10:29.203 --> 10:33.972
What other kinds of courses were they taking?

10:34.293 --> 10:37.980
Well, they were taking, I don't know just exactly.

10:38.381 --> 10:41.908
I know that some of the units were taking first aid courses.

10:43.154 --> 10:46.618
They were on other departments on campus.

10:46.678 --> 10:47.159
I don't remember.

10:47.199 --> 10:48.380
They were living in the dorms.

10:48.520 --> 10:54.428
They were living in the dorms under strict military regime because they were in the military.

10:54.448 --> 10:58.192
I know they took the engineering drawing division.

10:58.833 --> 11:05.000
It was a little wooden building just south of what is it now, G. Raleigh White.

11:06.162 --> 11:09.045
It was a wooden building, and I know a lot of them took engineering drawing.

11:10.347 --> 11:13.110
I know that some of them took first aid.

11:13.664 --> 11:17.129
And just what else they took, I'm not really familiar.

11:17.149 --> 11:24.861
Their instructors, I'll call them, to use a generic term, some of them were A&M regular faculty members.

11:24.921 --> 11:27.165
Yeah, most of them were regular A&M faculty members.

11:27.565 --> 11:31.351
They just took courses in those departments that they wanted special training in.

11:32.072 --> 11:37.140
How do you, as you recall them, what quality did they have as students?

11:37.306 --> 11:45.135
Of course, the only students I had in contact with was the Army Air Force, and they were very select.

11:46.637 --> 11:59.993
They were very select, and they wanted them in top physical condition, and we had those, and we had continuous calisthenics.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.258
They come down in formation and left in formation.

12:04.930 --> 12:08.856
Describe them in terms of age and attitude.

12:08.896 --> 12:13.863
The attitude was very good because all of them wanted to get into flight school.

12:14.624 --> 12:15.846
They wanted to go on to flight school.

12:17.688 --> 12:23.316
But their age was, I would say, 20 in the early 20s.

12:24.698 --> 12:32.710
Among the questions that I found that today's undergraduates ask and are surprised at the answer was,

12:33.668 --> 12:39.980
They will have asked me, well, what did people think was going to be the result of World War II?

12:40.040 --> 12:40.922
Who was going to win it?

12:42.365 --> 12:46.513
Did you ever hear any of those young men doubt who was going to win the war?

12:46.593 --> 12:48.898
I never heard anyone doubt who was going to win the war.

12:50.040 --> 12:55.170
And you never, I've never known the patriotism that was here.

12:55.707 --> 12:56.648
during World War II.

12:56.769 --> 13:02.297
People hung a flag in the window, you know, a star in the window if they had someone in service.

13:03.959 --> 13:08.646
And it was just, it was a feeling that is almost indescribable.

13:09.067 --> 13:12.833
Were most of these young men from the Southwest geographically?

13:14.775 --> 13:16.478
A lot of them were, but they were from all over the country.

13:16.538 --> 13:17.119
Is that right?

13:18.221 --> 13:25.191
Where did they, and you as a newcomer, where did you all go off campus for anything?

13:26.082 --> 13:29.808
for food, for groceries?

13:31.250 --> 13:38.141
We went to, well, George Bell wasn't able to come down until the latter part of April.

13:39.343 --> 13:41.186
So I lived with the Dow's.

13:42.248 --> 13:45.453
They had a spare bedroom and they put me in there and I ate with them.

13:46.014 --> 13:47.737
And so I didn't do any grocery shopping.

13:48.638 --> 13:52.765
But the only town that we went to was, I didn't have a car.

13:53.656 --> 13:58.282
because George had kept the car, and was Southside.

13:58.322 --> 14:07.755
There was the Southside Grocery, there was Medley Pharmacy, and there was a shoe shop up there, and the place would get your hair cut, and the cleaners.

14:09.117 --> 14:10.239
And that was our shopping center.

14:11.180 --> 14:14.264
Now, where did people go to church then?

14:14.324 --> 14:18.230
I went to church at the Indian Church of Christ at the North Gate.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.693
It was a beautiful building.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.552
but didn't seat very many people.

14:24.373 --> 14:27.477
About what was the size of the congregation?

14:27.497 --> 14:35.065
There were probably about six or seven families and maybe 60 or 70, 80 students.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.511
Now the other congregations that were nearby.

14:39.671 --> 14:50.123
There was a Baptist, there was a Methodist, and there was a Catholic church, a small Catholic church down on what is now University Drive.

14:52.634 --> 14:56.538
And there was a Presbyterian, the Presbyterians were out here, Episcopals out here.

14:56.578 --> 14:58.380
They were here.

14:58.420 --> 15:03.786
Any Lutheran yet?

15:04.626 --> 15:05.768
They came in later.

15:05.908 --> 15:06.729
That's what I thought.

15:07.049 --> 15:08.030
Yes, they came in later.

15:08.270 --> 15:11.313
There was a Lutheran church in town in Bryan.

15:11.674 --> 15:18.881
When you traveled to or from during that time, how did you travel to or from Kansas City?

15:20.223 --> 15:21.424
Well, I didn't travel to or from.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.405
When I got down here,

15:22.570 --> 15:23.371
Well, how'd you get here?

15:23.952 --> 15:24.413
On a train.

15:25.916 --> 15:26.276
On a train.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.079
I got off with the cottage station.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.702
There was a lot of train traffic then.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.007
You had all kinds of trains, and that concerns me now.

15:33.648 --> 15:37.835
I talk about moving the tracks to the west campus, way over to the river.

15:38.456 --> 15:46.149
We could so very easily come back to a period when there's a gasoline shortage, and we need those trains in here in town.

15:46.469 --> 15:48.072
This is not part of it.

15:49.047 --> 15:54.596
Well, and that's why the campus is where it is, because they put it on the track.

15:54.616 --> 15:54.856
Right.

15:55.156 --> 15:58.842
To get off at that college station, which is what they named it.

15:58.862 --> 15:58.982
Right.

15:59.002 --> 16:04.411
And when they built the highway, Tulane Highway, they tell me that they turned the campus around.

16:04.671 --> 16:04.751
Yes.

16:05.893 --> 16:06.895
So that it had both.

16:07.295 --> 16:08.477
Yeah.

16:08.497 --> 16:10.380
And now the airport triples it.

16:10.917 --> 16:16.062
And I agree with you that to have those three possibilities is quite important.

16:16.082 --> 16:29.055
And the students, they would line up at the East Gate along the highway there, and they'd put their bags down in line, and the first one would hitchhike, and he would find out about how many people we'd take, where he was going, and so forth.

16:29.075 --> 16:35.181
And they'd all load in, and you know, you didn't worry about picking up hitchhikers then.

16:35.642 --> 16:38.865
I have never talked to anyone either

16:39.098 --> 16:45.924
the driver of the car that picked up an Aggie or vice versa, I have never heard a negative report.

16:45.944 --> 16:47.445
Did you ever hear of any incidents?

16:47.625 --> 16:48.046
Not any.

16:48.186 --> 16:49.447
I have not heard of any.

16:49.467 --> 16:49.807
No.

16:49.827 --> 16:55.292
And they've all assured me that you didn't pull rank.

16:56.533 --> 16:57.253
In the line.

16:57.614 --> 16:58.374
Yeah, that's right.

16:58.394 --> 17:00.136
That it was who was first in line.

17:00.296 --> 17:02.117
Yes.

17:02.738 --> 17:03.218
Let's see.

17:05.340 --> 17:08.683
So you were here then for two or three months.

17:09.170 --> 17:11.914
And then your wife came down in April?

17:12.254 --> 17:12.514
Yes.

17:13.055 --> 17:15.058
And then where did y'all find a place to live then?

17:15.198 --> 17:19.343
We found a place at 301 Fairview.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.588
It was a duplex and we had the downstairs.

17:24.851 --> 17:29.777
And our daughters started to first grade at A&M Consolidated.

17:32.086 --> 17:37.133
She had started school before she was six, and so she was pretty young.

17:37.894 --> 17:44.344
And when she started reading, that gave her enough time to make friends before summer.

17:44.364 --> 17:59.646
Then the school was out, and in the fall of 1944, when I left to go in the service, George Bell started teaching school at A&M Consolidated.

18:00.672 --> 18:01.874
So she stayed here?

18:02.174 --> 18:03.456
Oh, yes, she stayed here.

18:03.556 --> 18:04.317
While you were away?

18:04.337 --> 18:04.558
Yes.

18:07.041 --> 18:13.190
At A&M Consolidate then, was there, do you remember, was there one first grade room or two or three?

18:13.231 --> 18:15.334
That would tell us about how many students there were.

18:15.354 --> 18:15.894
Well, there were two.

18:16.275 --> 18:17.256
Two rooms.

18:18.699 --> 18:25.028
And there were just wooden buildings over where the city conference center is now, just wooden buildings.

18:25.629 --> 18:29.835
And the high school had one long hall go right down the middle with rooms on each side.

18:30.305 --> 18:32.347
And George Bell was a homemaking teacher.

18:33.088 --> 18:35.731
And so she had two rooms.

18:37.372 --> 18:41.337
Then our daughter was in second grade or third grade.

18:41.857 --> 18:47.964
And her room was just right over 20, 30 yards away from where Carol went when George Bell was teaching.

18:48.364 --> 18:52.468
So she could come over after school and then ride to school with her mother and home with her mother.

18:52.488 --> 18:55.452
So she wasn't away from her at all.

18:55.472 --> 18:58.675
How was a newcomer yourself?

18:59.144 --> 19:04.390
How did you feel you were received by other faculty and other people?

19:04.871 --> 19:06.152
Oh, very, very warmly.

19:06.973 --> 19:07.254
Yes.

19:08.655 --> 19:10.778
It was kind of like A&M at that time.

19:13.842 --> 19:19.348
A lot of the faculty lived on campus, and it was kind of like a family.

19:20.329 --> 19:26.637
In the summertime, they would show movies at the Grove, and everybody would go down.

19:27.342 --> 19:38.656
And Georgeville would clean up my daughter, Carolyn, put a nice clean dress on her and everything, go to the movie, down to the Grove, and the president would be there and everyone.

19:39.077 --> 19:40.478
And Carolyn would buy a snow cone.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.182
No time at all, it was all over her dress.

19:43.642 --> 19:47.567
But you know, that's just a part of, and, but everybody got to know everybody.

19:48.048 --> 19:48.809
And you knew their kids.

19:48.829 --> 19:49.590
You knew their families.

19:50.531 --> 19:52.073
Now, who was the president then?

19:52.814 --> 19:53.134
T.O.

19:53.154 --> 19:53.494
Walton.

19:53.755 --> 19:56.438
Describe him to a new faculty member.

19:57.042 --> 19:57.904
I really can't.

19:58.545 --> 19:59.808
I didn't get to know him that well.

20:00.209 --> 20:03.576
And I said president, I was the president who followed him.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.219
Okay.

20:05.239 --> 20:07.183
Did you get acquainted with Gilchrist?

20:07.825 --> 20:08.226
Oh, yes.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.432
Very good friend of Gilchrist.

20:11.452 --> 20:15.962
Mr. Gilchrist was a man with a lot of foresight.

20:17.798 --> 20:22.183
He was, I'm quite an admirer of Gibb Gilchrist.

20:23.444 --> 20:26.787
And in fact, when he retired, he retired up here right on the corner.

20:27.929 --> 20:46.708
But Mr. Gilchrist was, I remember one time when Blackford wanted to go to school here, that a lawyer came in with a person who wanted to enroll at A&M.

20:47.903 --> 20:51.448
I just wanted to be sure it was going.

20:51.468 --> 20:51.648
Okay.

20:51.728 --> 20:58.196
And so the secretary came in and told him, Mr. Gilchrist, there's a lawyer here, and so this man wants to enroll in him.

20:59.137 --> 21:00.519
Gil Gilchrist got on the phone.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.562
He said, have him just wait just a minute.

21:02.582 --> 21:08.950
He got on the phone and called Prairie View and had that president drive up here, and the president came in the back way as Prairie Instructions.

21:09.773 --> 21:16.261
And then after the president got there, then Mr. Gilchrist opened the door and invited them to come in and said, now, here's the president of Prairie View.

21:16.521 --> 21:19.304
You can go back down and register Prairie View.

21:19.324 --> 21:22.828
This is the president that will enroll you.

21:22.848 --> 21:26.513
So he was very, he was very effective, very good president.

21:27.694 --> 21:28.976
Describe him physically.

21:29.516 --> 21:30.077
I don't know.

21:30.157 --> 21:38.667
Well, he was gray-haired and a little taller than I am.

21:41.212 --> 21:41.893
Sense of humor?

21:43.557 --> 21:43.978
Not really.

21:43.998 --> 21:48.106
He was pretty business.

21:48.808 --> 21:57.366
And I understand he was very much a College Station supporter as compared to the rival with Bryan.

21:57.686 --> 21:57.947
Yes.

22:01.434 --> 22:02.376
So was General Rutter.

22:04.111 --> 22:04.492
Let's see.

22:07.379 --> 22:07.559
No.

22:08.241 --> 22:09.764
Yes, he was.

22:10.446 --> 22:14.696
Because I was elected to, when I came back from service, I was elected to the city council.

22:16.540 --> 22:20.268
And one evening, one night, we got a call.

22:20.950 --> 22:23.115
They're having a call meeting of the city council.

22:24.935 --> 22:28.279
At that time, we were a charter city.

22:28.299 --> 22:29.340
We could not annex.

22:30.702 --> 22:39.011
And word had got to him that Brian was going to envelop College Station.

22:39.031 --> 22:43.537
We had a call meeting, and he had all of the meets and bounds and so forth all written out.

22:44.157 --> 22:48.883
And we had a first reading on annexing land east and west.

22:50.365 --> 22:57.191
And after we had our first reading on it, we had just got our city charter, and we just got our city, what do they call it?

22:57.992 --> 23:07.660
We were operating under a charter, but we just got, we became a full-fledged city, able to do things.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.041
I've forgotten the name of it now.

23:10.622 --> 23:13.285
But anyway, we had that first reading, and that stopped Brian.

23:14.345 --> 23:19.630
Were you at all around, do you remember,

23:19.947 --> 23:22.391
when the students marched on his house?

23:22.751 --> 23:23.953
Yes, I was here.

23:24.414 --> 23:26.978
Share any recollection of that?

23:27.699 --> 23:29.381
Well, I know they marched on his house.

23:30.964 --> 23:35.391
And that was one of the reasons I think that they created a job of Chancellor.

23:38.275 --> 23:41.500
But they didn't get anywhere with him.

23:42.897 --> 23:45.640
Did he have, let's see, you said he didn't have much of a sense of humor.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.863
I was going to ask you if you remembered any funny.

23:48.924 --> 23:49.605
No, I don't really.

23:51.167 --> 23:51.948
I knew him pretty well.

23:52.889 --> 23:59.717
Who were the other, when you come back from the war, who were the other key people leading A&M?

23:59.737 --> 24:02.220
Well, when I first came here, T.O.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.302
Walton was president.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.187
Dean Bolton was dean of the college.

24:07.287 --> 24:08.528
We were a college then.

24:09.309 --> 24:12.533
And Kyle was dean of the,

24:12.968 --> 24:14.149
College of Agriculture.

24:14.169 --> 24:21.677
I think McGee, I mean McNew was dean of the College of Engineering.

24:21.937 --> 24:23.039
J.T.L.

24:23.059 --> 24:23.179
McNew.

24:23.199 --> 24:24.000
J.T.L.

24:24.020 --> 24:24.260
McNew.

24:24.280 --> 24:24.840
Meyer's dad.

24:25.041 --> 24:25.301
Yes.

24:26.322 --> 24:33.750
And Brooks was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate College.

24:36.072 --> 24:38.875
Where did you and your colleagues and the

24:39.293 --> 24:42.779
Were you in the, was there a Department of Physical Education?

24:42.799 --> 24:43.300
No, yes.

24:44.062 --> 24:49.752
And Mr. Penberthy, who, it might be interesting to know how he came to A&M.

24:49.852 --> 24:51.796
Yes, tell about him.

24:52.797 --> 24:58.728
The ex-Bible, when he was coaching here, hired Mr. Penberthy from Ohio State.

24:58.748 --> 25:03.597
He'd just graduated with a degree in Physical Education, and he brought him down here to

25:04.133 --> 25:05.855
develop an intramural program.

25:06.015 --> 25:07.537
That would have been in the early 20s.

25:07.557 --> 25:10.320
That would have been in the mid-20s, I guess.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.322
26 around, I think, about then.

25:13.163 --> 25:24.095
But then, anyway, so then Mr. Penberthy was, he developed a very good intramural program, an outstanding program.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.698
And then in the 30s,

25:28.501 --> 25:34.451
38 or somewhere along there, he developed the Department of Physical Education.

25:35.954 --> 25:41.162
And I've looked at the offerings then, Army Recreation and a lot of courses like that.

25:42.445 --> 25:46.431
When I came, no one had a doctorate degree in the program.

25:47.133 --> 25:49.176
We didn't offer

25:50.911 --> 25:51.772
really a degree.

25:54.735 --> 26:01.741
We had required physical education, and we did offer a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.

26:02.462 --> 26:08.288
So that the typical graduate of the department became a high school?

26:08.308 --> 26:10.790
A physical education teacher, yes.

26:13.873 --> 26:19.078
Describe Mr. Penberthy as a person, and

26:20.257 --> 26:22.841
and what it was to work with him.

26:22.861 --> 26:23.402
Tremendous.

26:23.922 --> 26:25.324
He was a tremendous individual.

26:26.266 --> 26:29.671
And if he met you, he knew your name the next time.

26:30.171 --> 26:34.117
You could stand out with the entrance to Kyle Field.

26:34.918 --> 26:43.411
And as the students come back, almost everyone would speak to Penny, as he was known.

26:44.032 --> 26:45.053
And he could call them by name.

26:45.474 --> 26:46.956
He could tell himself about their family.

26:47.678 --> 26:49.100
He was just an amazing person.

26:50.603 --> 26:54.889
And the first dean of men was Mr. Penberthy.

26:56.312 --> 27:09.953
They appointed him dean, and this Spike White is Director of Student Affairs, and I forget who was Director of Student Activities.

27:11.255 --> 27:14.019
But- Now Spike came out of the department also?

27:14.059 --> 27:15.762
Yes, Spike came out of the department.

27:17.260 --> 27:24.589
What were Mr. Penberthy's, did he have anything that he really didn't like?

27:25.631 --> 27:28.474
What were the things that really irked him and what really made him happy?

27:30.577 --> 27:31.859
Loyalty would make him happy.

27:33.641 --> 27:34.763
The good things made him happy.

27:35.784 --> 27:44.415
Now, he was also, as I said, moved up to Dean of Men, and he was very good, but I remember he also wrote a column for

27:44.800 --> 27:47.442
the battalion, Penny Serenade.

27:48.823 --> 27:54.348
And at one time, we had a very, we had a losing season.

27:55.549 --> 27:59.012
And we had a quarterback who was throwing a lot of incomplete passes.

27:59.753 --> 28:01.434
And the student body booed.

28:02.155 --> 28:05.437
I've never heard it before, I've never heard it since.

28:05.457 --> 28:06.018
But they booed.

28:06.398 --> 28:12.203
And Mr. Penny had an article in the paper, Penny Serenade, on that one thing.

28:12.663 --> 28:14.605
He says, it doesn't take any courage

28:15.243 --> 28:17.286
to stand up in the stands and boo.

28:17.846 --> 28:22.212
But it says it takes courage to get down on the field and play, to officiate it or whatever.

28:22.712 --> 28:26.337
And he had a real good column that he really took the Aggies to test.

28:26.797 --> 28:28.099
I've never heard of boo since then.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.340
That's good.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.141
That's good.

28:31.303 --> 28:32.685
But he lost his job.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.648
They brought him back into the department.

28:35.889 --> 28:36.009
Oh.

28:37.571 --> 28:39.713
I'd like to tell you why.

28:39.934 --> 28:42.377
Please, go ahead.

28:42.397 --> 28:43.478
It was over Kyle Field.

28:44.572 --> 28:50.683
You know, we just had the lower bleachers and they were not built really for football bleachers.

28:51.163 --> 28:57.895
We had the track built in there and the bleachers had a very low incline.

28:59.177 --> 29:09.415
So if you were sitting up past the first row, even on the first row, you couldn't stand by standing on the track, you couldn't see the field.

29:11.167 --> 29:15.811
they had to expand the facility.

29:16.252 --> 29:27.642
So Mr. Penberthy said, let's take it across the tracks and start and build a football stadium, you know, with the proper incline of the seats and this sort of thing.

29:28.343 --> 29:29.344
And he pushed for that.

29:30.445 --> 29:34.108
And there's one board member on there that was really opposed it.

29:34.469 --> 29:39.233
And so they locked horns because Mr. Penberthy was on the athletic board then.

29:41.002 --> 29:42.284
chairman of the ethnic department.

29:43.425 --> 29:44.307
And they locked horns.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.491
And the next year, he was no longer dean.

29:49.013 --> 29:49.774
I remember O.D.

29:49.834 --> 29:59.348
Butler making the same proposal at an academic council meeting before we got ready to build the permanent second deck.

29:59.368 --> 29:59.929
Yes.

29:59.949 --> 30:08.581
And he was saying, let's abandon this outdated, go across the tracks, and build what is the equivalent of the first level of Rice Stadium.

30:08.601 --> 30:08.761
Yes.

30:08.781 --> 30:10.063
It's about 40,000.

30:10.600 --> 30:21.314
Then when we fill that, we can build one and then a first upper deck, then a second, then we can close in the end zone at one end at the second level and then third.

30:22.095 --> 30:31.047

30:34.343 --> 30:38.870
