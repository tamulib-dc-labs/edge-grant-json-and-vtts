WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:10.105
A couple of these faculty crying because they just didn't feel they were being successful.

00:11.247 --> 00:14.253
Were the students ever mean to the minority?

00:14.273 --> 00:15.054
Kind of, yeah.

00:15.695 --> 00:17.459
Mean not knowing it.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.284
Mean in the sense also that

00:21.496 --> 00:24.160
A lot of them didn't know what they were doing.

00:24.300 --> 00:39.060
The whole idea that isn't it great that this black faculty member can be a graduate student or be a faculty member, which put them above them, you know, in a sense.

00:39.420 --> 00:44.567
But it was not, you give me the impression, it was not

00:44.885 --> 00:49.610
any deliberate attempt to be mean or rude to the person?

00:49.630 --> 00:58.919
No, we never had anybody that was for phone calls or threats or things like that that I knew of.

00:59.360 --> 01:12.073
But I think if you were to talk with the faculty, the minority faculty, they would all say that they were treated very well.

01:12.661 --> 01:22.472
They had problems that are the natural, the kind of problems of worrying that someone thought they were hired because they were a minority.

01:22.832 --> 01:25.775
I remember having this conversation one time with By Flores.

01:25.795 --> 01:32.402
He said, I don't want to be viewed as the token minority here.

01:33.323 --> 01:37.588
I want people to know that I've been hired because of my qualifications.

01:38.024 --> 01:42.749
She ended up, you know, she came here with a doctorate from the University of Nebraska.

01:46.053 --> 01:57.746
She taught over at the cooperative center over in Sam Houston, and I found that she was most effective with teachers as well as working with university people.

01:58.647 --> 02:03.492
She got the bilingual program started here because she took all these linguists

02:04.636 --> 02:10.646
who thought that everybody who was going to teach bilingual education needed to have a degree in linguistics.

02:11.607 --> 02:15.613
The way she handled them was she invited them to lunch with some classroom teachers.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.019
Have you ever met her, Vi Flores?

02:19.339 --> 02:20.461
What's your first name?

02:20.481 --> 02:20.862
Vi.

02:21.763 --> 02:22.725
V-I-E?

02:23.005 --> 02:23.746
V-I.

02:24.708 --> 02:24.788
V-I.

02:24.768 --> 02:31.537
She has this wonderful personality, and she's smart in terms of the politics.

02:32.458 --> 02:37.525
So she invites these key, I forgot the guy's name in linguistics, head of the Department of Linguistics.

02:38.547 --> 02:49.201
She got him on her side, and she had him meet with the teachers and had the teachers describe to them what they do in bilingual ed classes and the whole notion of transitioning them into the English.

02:50.683 --> 02:54.488
And within two years, she had a bilingual ed program full-blown here.

02:55.733 --> 03:04.823
And then we had a master's program that was developed, and we created a bilingual education center during the time she was here.

03:05.704 --> 03:06.705
All right.

03:06.725 --> 03:11.790
Major frustrations as the things that didn't work out?

03:13.032 --> 03:23.563
I tell you, the frustrations were primarily with the politics, with the legislature.

03:24.421 --> 03:30.460
And those were, you know, challenges that every other dean of education in the United States was facing at that time as well.

03:30.500 --> 03:35.656
You remember, there was a period there where we were talking about doing away with colleges of education.

03:36.298 --> 03:38.565
Do you, looking back,

03:39.558 --> 03:44.306
Have you thought of some things that you could have done differently that would have worked better?

03:44.967 --> 03:50.416
Yeah, I think you always can do things differently.

03:50.656 --> 03:56.486
I never was satisfied with the way we handled the vocational industrial education area.

03:56.727 --> 04:02.376
See, we didn't have the same arrangement there as we had with agriculture.

04:02.356 --> 04:05.824
See, they didn't stay in industrial distribution.

04:05.884 --> 04:07.628
They came into the College of Ed.

04:08.289 --> 04:17.209
And so our connections with industrial distribution were not the same way that the Ag Ed people related to the Agricultural College.

04:18.117 --> 04:20.582
And that's a tough one for almost every land grant.

04:20.603 --> 04:24.291
As you know, every land grant university has that connection.

04:24.331 --> 04:31.206
You have similar problems sometimes with some of the departments in liberal arts and science.

04:32.409 --> 04:37.881
But that area, I was never totally

04:38.688 --> 04:40.891
satisfied with the way we handled that.

04:41.011 --> 04:48.362
I thought some of the faculty there got a short end of the deal when we did some reorganization and things like this.

04:49.323 --> 04:59.397
Where do you think then, ten years ago and now, where does Texas A&M's program in education, where does it justifiably rate?

04:59.697 --> 05:03.245
I think it depends upon the program area.

05:03.626 --> 05:04.809
Where have we been?

05:04.829 --> 05:10.341
I think probably in the areas of special education.

05:10.782 --> 05:15.613
We've always had national leadership in that area.

05:15.593 --> 05:33.602
People, when you go to Washington, they point out this program, particularly the program in the doctoral area where we prepare more minority Hispanic faculty than all the rest of the institutions in the country do.

05:35.489 --> 05:38.895
Of course, that's because of the pool here in Texas, part of it.

05:39.476 --> 05:41.519
But it's because we also have been committed to this.

05:43.021 --> 05:57.806
And so we're graduating more PhDs in Ed Psych who are Hispanic than I think our programs in teacher ed, particularly in some of the elementary ed areas.

05:57.866 --> 06:01.632
We've always had people seeking our graduates.

06:01.612 --> 06:06.480
Math and science, you know, we've had times when it's been kind of like this.

06:08.123 --> 06:13.351
It's hard to keep the commitment sometimes of people in the disciplines to teacher ed.

06:14.413 --> 06:24.970
So a lot changes when a particular, like Janie Shelock and her husband have always been in math, and Dachwala was in the College of Ed.

06:25.169 --> 06:29.093
Even though they were in different colleges, it was like they were on the same page.

06:30.274 --> 06:44.247
But we haven't always had that in other, within the arts and sciences, to make the preparation of teachers your primary focus isn't oftentimes rewarded like it would be.

06:44.287 --> 06:53.235
They're rewarded for what they do in terms of majors or their books that they write and things like that.

06:53.924 --> 07:02.141
Is there any program that we ought, now we're looking forward, is there any program in education that A&M ought to add to?

07:03.183 --> 07:12.422
I think this whole area that I was talking to you about earlier, which is the whole development of interprofessional training

07:13.094 --> 07:21.062
where we prepare our teachers to work closely with other professions that serve the same families.

07:21.863 --> 07:38.359
Not necessarily as a major, but this is a program we've already started with special education, where they do a leadership program in special ed, and take a minor in interprofessional, interagency collaboration.

07:38.339 --> 07:51.450
And what I think we could do is begin to prepare some people who not only had a specialty in their field, but also were the kind of people who connect these professions.

07:51.470 --> 07:54.036
Because so many of the policies today

07:55.467 --> 08:00.354
that are being developed cut across these areas.

08:00.374 --> 08:02.937
In fact, states now are being organized.

08:03.358 --> 08:08.485
Like Minnesota, for instance, just created a Secretary of Child and Family Programs.

08:09.186 --> 08:16.716
He meets twice a month with the commissioners of education, health, social work, and in their five-year planning,

08:17.641 --> 08:26.622
They not only have what their own agency's going to do, but they have a section on what the agency's going to do in relationship to the other

08:27.192 --> 08:29.175
agencies that serve families.

08:29.816 --> 08:49.885
So if you're dealing with a problem like drugs, drug education, and you got money coming from criminal justice and money coming from health and money coming from education, you put it all together, you blend the funds, you can come up with a comprehensive package rather than each unit trying to do it alone.

08:50.425 --> 08:54.972
And I think we could become an institution

08:54.952 --> 09:03.701
that could prepare leaders who could be these community leaders, not just education leaders.

09:04.562 --> 09:13.170
Are there any programs that have been traditional here and other places that we ought to prepare for their phasing out?

09:18.335 --> 09:20.377
I think changing significant.

09:20.678 --> 09:24.081
I think we really need to do more with early childhood.

09:25.141 --> 09:26.363
than we've done in the past.

09:26.403 --> 09:35.257
We've started primarily with kindergarten and first grade, but we really don't have programs for early childhood.

09:35.878 --> 09:39.764
I think in that respect we need to work more closely with community colleges.

09:40.786 --> 09:46.796
What we might end up doing is being the trainers of the trainers in those other settings.

09:47.116 --> 09:51.503
It would be natural for them to look at us to do this.

09:51.668 --> 09:55.612
Are there annual rankings of colleges of education?

09:55.632 --> 09:58.214
Yes, and they rank them by program.

09:59.295 --> 10:09.205
Our Department of Education Administration, which I think within the Department of Education Administration also we've done some tremendous things with outreach and working with minorities.

10:09.445 --> 10:17.153
Our program down in San Antonio, which we've had particularly through Steve Stock's efforts,

10:17.707 --> 10:25.675
is one of the reasons why we have been listed as one of the institutions that's done the most in terms of serving minorities.

10:26.477 --> 10:29.809
But our minorities, oftentimes,

10:30.582 --> 10:32.244
situated in San Antonio.

10:32.444 --> 10:35.908
We have classrooms down there at the Hemisphere Center.

10:36.128 --> 10:39.793
In fact, I'm going down there on Thursday nights, Friday nights.

10:40.954 --> 10:52.147
I go down Friday night and then stay Saturday from 9 to 3, 5 to 8 on Friday night, and have a cohort there.

10:53.228 --> 10:57.073
But it's because we've been willing to go off campus and go down there.

10:57.133 --> 10:59.796
Now, he said something like 90 doctoral students.

11:00.586 --> 11:02.729
that he himself has advised down there.

11:03.310 --> 11:06.734
And then he gets the rest of the faculty to go down there and offer courses.

11:07.475 --> 11:10.459
But most of the students in those classes are Hispanic.

11:11.821 --> 11:14.084
Is that program highly ranked?

11:14.104 --> 11:20.373
Highly ranked, and the Ed admin department is among the top 20 in the country.

11:21.754 --> 11:23.657
Would we be in the top?

11:24.211 --> 11:26.816
25 or 50 in other areas?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.120
Special ed, I think.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.144
Our teacher ed is getting there.

11:32.367 --> 11:38.719
We've had a lot of changes in teacher ed leadership over the years.

11:39.941 --> 11:43.468
But we are part of the good lad

11:44.005 --> 11:46.291
national studies.

11:48.496 --> 11:56.175
We helped A&M as a system get this one of 12 grants in the country, not only to prepare

11:56.408 --> 12:06.124
people and recruit teachers here, but all the other colleges in the system, the College of Education's efforts and that was key to the whole thing.

12:06.204 --> 12:12.354
It's one of twelve programs in the country funded by the Office of Educational Research.

12:13.115 --> 12:22.230
So the programs in teacher ed are continuing to get identified nationally as being outstanding programs.

12:23.088 --> 12:31.478
It's making believe that all the people that you have worked with since you got here, they were all available.

12:31.762 --> 12:35.768
To which ones would you want to give your special appreciation most?

12:36.048 --> 12:37.190
I'm not going to ask you the negative.

12:37.390 --> 12:37.550
Yeah.

12:37.851 --> 12:39.533
Particularly, what about the office staff?

12:39.553 --> 12:42.398
Who were they, the key office staff?

12:42.418 --> 12:45.162
Peggy Ritchie was my associate.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.624
Make believe I don't know Peggy Ritchie.

12:46.644 --> 12:48.627
You know Peggy.

12:48.647 --> 12:51.311
A tremendous person.

12:53.754 --> 12:55.477
Helped me understand the culture.

12:58.140 --> 13:01.245
You know, knew the history.

13:02.542 --> 13:03.644
of the institution.

13:07.531 --> 13:18.432
The other person, of course, that I think has just not only been a key leader in the college but in the university as well is Brian Cole.

13:19.414 --> 13:24.904
Every time they need somebody to do a tough job, they get Brian, you know, he's going to chair this.

13:25.289 --> 13:27.373
committee to follow up the bonfire thing.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.660
He was the associate dean when I came in here.

13:30.680 --> 13:36.491
He's a good example of a person, of how I believe you need to fit the individual role to the organization.

13:36.551 --> 13:38.495
Ryan could do so many things.

13:39.096 --> 13:40.159
He helped me with budget.

13:40.179 --> 13:42.363
He handled all the student affairs operations.

13:42.403 --> 13:45.930
I had David David as associate dean for all the outreach.

13:45.910 --> 13:48.634
working with the schools, student teaching.

13:48.674 --> 13:58.148
And then I had Borman, who's now dean at University of Texas, San Antonio, as associate dean for graduate education.

13:59.109 --> 14:01.513
And what happened was we were all co-deans.

14:01.673 --> 14:12.188
The way I operated, I always believed that there ought to be two or more people that know about what's going on in the office so that you don't have to wait for somebody to get back.

14:12.252 --> 14:16.238
If I was in Washington to a meeting or in the state or something.

14:17.801 --> 14:24.271
My approach was that whatever came in, if it had something to do with graduate education or research, I'd send it to Borman.

14:24.331 --> 14:28.096
If it had to do with outreach and field experience, I'd send it to David David.

14:28.437 --> 14:32.764
If it had to do with budget or student affairs, I'd send it to Brian, and they would handle it.

14:33.545 --> 14:37.551
If it had something to do with the department, I'd send it to the department.

14:37.902 --> 14:44.655
And the team, I mean, what I appreciated most was the quality of the people that I had here.

14:45.356 --> 14:55.234
And I've always believed that people have the ability to do more than they've been given a chance to do, unlike the Peter Principle.

14:56.076 --> 15:01.446
I buy the Townsend notion, you know, the guy that wrote that book called Up the Organization.

15:02.118 --> 15:12.215
where everybody's not operating at one level above their ability, but they're operating at a level where they haven't fully been able to utilize the potential.

15:12.315 --> 15:17.904
And the job of leadership is to create the conditions to help them become better.

15:19.787 --> 15:23.494
And none of the people that I work with ever failed me on that.

15:23.974 --> 15:25.577
I mean, they just...

15:25.844 --> 15:32.553
My big problem with some of these people was to try to keep saying, no, you can't do it all.

15:33.734 --> 15:35.436
Brian would come in a certain week.

15:35.456 --> 15:47.612
When we were going through some of these battles, he'd come in with his eyes all black and working all weekend and just burning himself out.

15:47.632 --> 15:48.794
He's always been that way.

15:49.054 --> 15:50.776
I keep telling him this now.

15:51.057 --> 15:54.141
He's head of the department going through reorganization.

15:54.441 --> 15:55.142
We're merging

15:56.033 --> 15:59.418
human resources with Ed Edmund.

16:00.158 --> 16:04.104
So he's doing all that, and then he takes on this other responsibility.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.008
And the reason is he's probably the only one that can do it.

16:07.028 --> 16:08.289
I mean, he can do it.

16:09.331 --> 16:11.554
But the leadership's unbelievable.

16:11.574 --> 16:12.435
How many people do you want to thank?

16:14.237 --> 16:20.766
Well, I think that, you know, I've had great students, too.

16:20.906 --> 16:25.332
I mean, my research associates, and they're all over the place now,

16:25.852 --> 16:27.155
who just have helped me.

16:27.436 --> 16:31.104
I've got a guy here now who's a former DA.

16:31.765 --> 16:40.525
He got a law degree, and I've always had students, work-study students, who've been terrific.

16:41.607 --> 16:44.113
A number of them were minority kids.

16:44.853 --> 16:48.217
And they gave me a lot of help, too.

16:48.237 --> 16:50.821
So it's hard to pick out any one person.

16:50.841 --> 17:02.956
There's so many, so many people that, you know, I really felt were the ones that really were doing everything.

17:02.976 --> 17:07.222
What are your favorite Aggie stories, Aggie experience stories?

17:07.242 --> 17:09.104
It may be incredible, but they're true.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.328
Well, a lot of these,

17:13.557 --> 17:21.805
A lot of these stories that these guys, you know, these former students that I met were funny Aggie stories.

17:23.026 --> 17:35.258
The Judge Stewart kind of story, you know, they're a little risky to tell.

17:35.278 --> 17:43.125
I was hoping you might have had some experiences of working with an Aggie or being with Aggies that

17:43.510 --> 17:49.582
some experiences that were... Well, not only to the extent that they're very loyal to the place.

17:50.263 --> 17:52.848
I mean, they do anything for it.

17:53.169 --> 17:57.477
I mean, when we started the Development Council, our problem wasn't getting people to be on it.

17:58.459 --> 18:00.483
It was, you know, everybody wanted to be on it.

18:00.864 --> 18:04.371
And they'd come to the meetings and...

18:05.363 --> 18:16.774
My basic image of the place is that it's hard to explain it to anybody else.

18:17.868 --> 18:24.998
When I would go to Dean's meetings, we'd have student NEA get together on a Wednesday night.

18:25.158 --> 18:27.782
In the middle of the week, 450 kids show up.

18:29.865 --> 18:36.214
You can't get students in some other place to come to meetings, because there's not a whole lot of other things to do here on a Wednesday night.

18:36.194 --> 18:50.114
But here they're coming to very serious, preparing for their stand they're going to take on the next issue at the student NEA meeting, organizing SCONA activities like this.

18:52.798 --> 18:57.265
Serious, but have a lot of fun, tremendously loyal to each other.

18:59.548 --> 19:03.113
I think it's very hard to explain to other people.

19:03.278 --> 19:06.341
Did any Aggie ever question your Texas accent?

19:07.522 --> 19:15.250
I've had people who, and they're always very, they're not nasty about it or anything.

19:15.270 --> 19:19.534
They just, like when I first came here, I was giving a speech I remember in McAllen.

19:19.554 --> 19:26.401
And this little lady came up after her, and she says to me, what's that language you were speaking?

19:27.642 --> 19:32.307
And she said, you sure do speak fast.

19:32.287 --> 19:37.713
And I think it's been really interesting.

19:37.753 --> 19:42.177
You know, I haven't, my accent, I still have this accent, this New England accent.

19:43.759 --> 19:47.963
But people never really seem to bother.

19:47.983 --> 19:50.126
Maybe they think I'm from a foreign country or something.

19:51.087 --> 19:53.769
But they never held it against me, I don't think anyway.

19:54.270 --> 19:57.333
I've never felt like I wasn't accepted.

19:59.235 --> 20:01.197
All right, special moments that you cherish.

20:01.463 --> 20:03.147
since you've been in the area?

20:05.211 --> 20:19.303
Well, when I would say whenever we had

20:20.465 --> 20:24.189
meetings, and they went well.

20:26.031 --> 20:32.918
We came out of the sessions with a full set of ideas that we were going to implement next.

20:36.002 --> 20:49.476
Times, you know, when we celebrated together, people, you know, supporting each other.

20:50.924 --> 20:56.370
The whole experience that I had here as a dean was a very exciting, rewarding experience.

20:56.410 --> 21:00.615
It was hard for me to move out of the deanship, but I knew I was ready.

21:01.716 --> 21:10.146
Gardner and Bennis say about seven to ten years in the same spot, the same institution, is about long enough.

21:10.166 --> 21:13.590
It's probably better that someone else comes in

21:13.992 --> 21:15.494
And I knew I was ready.

21:15.834 --> 21:30.193
One of the things that told me when I would go to those Dean's Council meetings, I'd look around, right, and they'd hand out the agenda, and the agenda item would be one that I'd seen three times before.

21:32.797 --> 21:37.603
Maybe love is better the second time around, but those agenda items really do get

21:37.583 --> 21:41.590
Were you the senior dean when you were teaching?

21:41.610 --> 21:47.339
All but one person, I think, was... And you ceased deaning entirely on your own.

21:47.359 --> 21:48.541
On my own, yeah.

21:48.561 --> 21:49.583
Yeah, I was ready.

21:50.064 --> 21:53.470
See, I'd been a dean for 23 years, and I loved to teach.

21:54.071 --> 22:01.363
And the time I knew was...

22:02.407 --> 22:06.552
some time left to really get engaged in some of these other activities.

22:06.572 --> 22:14.541
I had been engaged in a lot of national activities and stuff, doing my own writing, which I was really interested in.

22:14.621 --> 22:16.223
I've always done over the years.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.688
And it seemed the time right.

22:20.748 --> 22:24.212
Everything was going real good.

22:24.192 --> 22:30.900
See, Mobley was president at the time, and I had good relationships with him.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.062
He understood it when I went in to talk to him.

22:33.122 --> 22:40.451
He didn't want me to do it, but he said, if you decide you don't want to be a dean anymore, that's fine.

22:40.851 --> 22:42.173
I got another job for you.

22:43.534 --> 22:50.402
Make believe that you are now, as of this moment, you are the outside consultant.

22:51.344 --> 22:56.491
to advise Texas A&M for the future of the College of Education here.

22:56.511 --> 22:57.512
What advice would you give?

22:57.532 --> 22:58.353
Right.

22:58.373 --> 23:13.673
The advice I'd give would be to help it define a few areas that they want to really make their market and to not to be using

23:16.100 --> 23:19.107
the United States News and World Report criteria.

23:22.073 --> 23:31.213
Because I've always believed that what you are is what you are at home, not what you are when you go to these national meetings with these other people.

23:31.334 --> 23:32.877
That you make your reputation

23:33.498 --> 23:36.463
by being good at what you do where you are.

23:36.723 --> 23:48.182
And I think this place, as a state leader, as a land-grant institution, can be the greatest land-grant institution in the United States.

23:48.443 --> 23:51.288
It won't be a great Princeton.

23:52.409 --> 23:57.598
And so I think what it ought to do is take a look at what it's got.

23:58.270 --> 24:06.821
Because you're not gonna hold a whole lot of money to hire totally new faculties to do a new thing.

24:06.841 --> 24:25.105
You gotta have it go through an assessment of what it's got, what are the cutting-edge areas that Texas land-grant institution can make a mark doing, and through that, develop its national reputation.

24:26.013 --> 24:30.219
not trying to mimic the so-called top ten.

24:30.739 --> 24:37.288
Because the top ten aren't institutions that we want to or can compete against.

24:37.328 --> 24:41.774
They have different missions, different people, different purposes.

24:42.856 --> 24:46.941
And this place still has this

24:47.680 --> 24:54.248
opportunity to release a whole lot of potential using the state itself.

24:55.830 --> 25:04.401
And I worry it may have lost some of this with all of its attention to wanting to be like the top ten.

25:06.464 --> 25:11.190
And I think that turns off certain leaders in the legislature.

25:11.170 --> 25:25.344
that we ought to be the top institution because we're doing something that's unique to the setting that we're in.

25:25.685 --> 25:32.992
And we've already got international connections, but we also have a state here that is unique.

25:33.933 --> 25:38.798
And rather than looking outward for something to mimic,

25:39.706 --> 25:42.552
You don't become great by mimicking anything.

25:42.652 --> 25:51.531
You become great by becoming unique and distinctive with what you've got in the place you're at.

25:52.774 --> 25:54.237
That's what I think, anyway.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.283
All right, I've only got two more questions.

25:57.965 --> 25:59.588
Let's make believe someone walks up and

26:03.010 --> 26:10.487
pass it on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide how they use the money, what would it be for?

26:10.507 --> 26:20.209
Well, I'd invest a lot in making the institution look more like the population of the state of Texas.

26:20.864 --> 26:35.937
And that's one of the areas that if we're going to become distinctive, you can't have this gap between what the state looks like and what this institution looks like.

26:35.917 --> 26:39.944
So what this means is you can't just change Texas A&M.

26:41.167 --> 26:46.076
You have to make a commitment to change the whole educational system in the state of Texas.

26:47.759 --> 26:53.149
So I would take, and a million wouldn't go a long way, I'd have to get more than a million.

26:53.129 --> 27:10.277
I take an emphasis on starting with creating healthy human communities throughout the state and healthy educational systems and use the talent of the institution wherever it could be to do that.

27:10.257 --> 27:19.310
to create jobs, to create training, to create good health conditions, and release the potential of the minority communities.

27:21.092 --> 27:24.217
Poverty has a lot to do with what people are able to become.

27:25.398 --> 27:33.550
I think we need to think outside of the traditional ways we think about education.

27:33.750 --> 27:37.075
It's not thinking about families and healthy communities.

27:37.814 --> 27:41.359
and invest a lot in community building.

27:42.921 --> 27:44.102
Okay, last question.

27:45.784 --> 27:50.210
What feelings do you hold in your heart today for Texas A&M?

27:50.230 --> 27:52.934
Oh, this place is, you know, I stayed here for 20 years.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.119
It became part of me.

27:57.139 --> 28:02.927
You know, I'm as much of a, even though I went to school there, I'm as much of an Aggie now as everybody else.

28:03.650 --> 28:16.347
The feelings I have, and a lot of it has to do with people, you know, I think that they're as much a part of me as anything.

28:16.367 --> 28:17.568
You know, they're real family.

28:18.590 --> 28:21.273
This place is unique in that regard.

28:21.514 --> 28:26.220
You get real close to people on an intellectual level as well as personal level.

28:27.622 --> 28:31.767
And I'm really proud of the people that, you know, I've helped.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.083
developed to the extent that I have.

28:35.606 --> 28:37.129
They treated me really well.

28:38.251 --> 28:39.733
I had this chair.

28:39.994 --> 28:46.505
I had a lot of opportunity to do these kinds of things, like this national commission that I serve on.

28:48.729 --> 28:51.915
It's been great.
