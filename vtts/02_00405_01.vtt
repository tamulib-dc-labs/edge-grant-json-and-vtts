WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:03.128
What's your name? José López. José López, and you?

00:13.479 --> 00:13.699
Irapuato. And your town? Here, Tamaulipas. 
Tamaulipas, and what town? San Carlos. San

00:20.686 --> 00:22.488
Carlos.

00:23.930 --> 00:26.412
And what town is near San Carlos? Ciudad Victoria. 
Ah, Ciudad Victoria.

00:35.570 --> 00:38.856
Well, how old are you? Sixty-ninety-two.

00:44.125 --> 00:44.826
Ninety-two. And you? Sixty-seven.

00:51.257 --> 00:53.861
And what year were you here in Texas? The 10th. The 
10th? 1910. 1910. And you? In 1928. In 1928? She got

01:02.886 --> 01:09.093
married after she got here.

01:09.474 --> 01:16.302
How old

01:09.474 --> 01:16.302
were you when you left Mexico? I was...

01:18.184 --> 01:25.293
Nineteen. Eighty-four. No, not... Eighty-one.

01:32.675 --> 01:33.696
1881. 1881. But 19 is 19 and 10 is...

01:34.357 --> 01:47.669
You were born in 1881 and you came, left Mexico in 
1910. So you were nearly 30 years old. Casi 30 años.

01:55.456 --> 01:55.696
29. 29 años cuando salió de México. 20. For what 
reason do you come here to the United States? Why

02:07.036 --> 02:10.901
did you come here? Life

02:11.141 --> 02:23.054
in Mexico

02:11.141 --> 02:23.054
is very expensive.

02:25.016 --> 02:30.222
In these years? And what kind of work do you have in 
Mexico? I had. You had? Just sowing. Sowing. In

02:41.383 --> 02:45.728
your own land? No. No? In the middle. In the middle? 
For a owner? Yes. In the city of Iropuato or near?

03:00.509 --> 03:29.841
Pueblo

03:00.509 --> 03:29.841
Nuevo Pueblo Nuevo

03:30.074 --> 03:32.838
That's the name of the town.

03:35.102 --> 03:37.185
Steven. When did

03:37.285 --> 03:45.939
you come to Texas? Where did you live in the first 
place in 1910?

03:53.370 --> 03:57.837
I lived in a shop called Tomelope's. I was working 
in a farm in Medes. In Medes with my husband. Sowing

04:06.406 --> 04:07.227
corn. Here in Texas? No. No, over there. Over 
there. But here, when did you come here? Here I was

04:15.716 --> 04:17.558
sowing. I was sowing all over the place. I was 
working in the railroad for about five years. And

04:28.073 --> 04:33.562
then I learned how to work the cart, how to work the 
cart. There is a lot of work in the cart. It was very

04:36.367 --> 04:39.212
hard at that time. Now there is machinery to work 
naturally. There wasn't before. Before you could

04:47.546 --> 04:52.754
work with pure strength. Yes.

04:57.250 --> 05:03.658
And for what reason do you come to Texas and not from 
California or another part of the United States?

05:04.119 --> 05:06.001
Because here it's more immediate. It's more 
immediate to go to Texas. To go there it's very,

05:09.105 --> 05:11.228
very far. Yes? Yes. And in what way do you come? By 
paella? By train? No, on the train. One comes to

05:20.636 --> 05:27.324
Laredo and pays one or two reales and they let him go 
home. They paid? Yes, they paid two reales. They

05:32.310 --> 05:35.634
paid one or two reales to go to this side. Yes.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.423
And for what reason do they come to Bryant? We came 
to live here and then we bought the house here. We

05:52.563 --> 05:55.908
bought the house here and we were working very 
hard. I had a big family. I had no money. I went to

05:59.012 --> 06:10.027
Hueas and from there I brought 200, 300 pesos and 
with that we lived here. I had a lot of family. A lot

06:11.889 --> 06:13.191
of big boys. And where did you meet your wife? Where 
did you meet your wife? Here, in Franklin. In

06:23.517 --> 06:24.137
Franklin? And why were you in Franklin?

06:33.047 --> 06:35.049
My older sister lived here. Yes. And from Mexico, I 
came here. Yes. Franklin. Franklin. And then they

06:47.195 --> 06:48.717
met there. Yes. In what year did her sister come 
here? 1910. 1910.

06:58.325 --> 07:03.690
For what reason did she come here? She came here. 
They came to look for

07:06.012 --> 07:12.558
work to live more. Yes. Better?

07:17.444 --> 07:22.290
And how did they get here? By train? No, in those 
years it was by train. There was no other way. In

07:33.061 --> 07:38.847
Laredo, there are men who hire people and bring 
them here. And that's how they get here. And are

07:43.874 --> 07:51.826
there problems with the revolution in your town 
when they come to the United States? No. No? Or why?

07:55.311 --> 07:57.854
It's already happened. When we came here, they 
only paid one for the bridge, you know, two reals,

07:57.874 --> 08:08.109
and they only paid one for this. And here, since 
it's more... Life is more forbidden. The children

08:15.750 --> 08:22.119
come here and

08:15.750 --> 08:22.119
don't come back. I haven't returned to the banks of 
the river. Life is very hard over there. Life is

08:28.288 --> 08:31.633
very hard over there. All you can do is plant corn. 
Plant corn with mules, in the middle of the field.

08:40.152 --> 08:48.766
We moved here and it was very comfortable because I 
had a big family and we made ourselves live better.

08:50.409 --> 08:51.831
That's why we moved here. Did you come with your 
family or alone? Alone. I came alone. Do you have

09:01.787 --> 09:05.333
relatives there at the airport? I had, who knows 
now, for so long, already 92 years. 92 years. And

09:11.652 --> 09:15.537
you never came back to visit there? No. No, why not? 
I just enjoyed the river. Because I didn't like it

09:22.227 --> 09:25.552
there anymore. Life was very hard. You like life 
here in the United States more? Yes. For what

09:31.120 --> 09:32.502
reasons? Sí, porque traigo mucha familia, 
¿sabes? Yo me ganaba muy buen dinero. No tenías

09:37.432 --> 09:39.675
familia entonces. Tenía como, creo que eran tres, 
¿no? Ramón y Cande. Eso fue después que nos

09:48.648 --> 09:51.693
casaron. Cuando él entró para acá, andaba solo. 
Sí. Y ganaba... And your money was paid by whoever

10:00.140 --> 10:07.809
did the work. And you, you lived in your town during 
the revolution,

10:08.670 --> 10:17.160
right? Yes, I was a girl. Do you remember anything

10:19.904 --> 10:27.032
like this? Well... I remember when the... The 
Pancho Viña war. He tried to go to the capital. But

10:36.953 --> 10:42.920
in the haciendas there were groups of soldiers. 
And they were the ones who were doing evil. And

10:48.105 --> 10:49.927
that's what I remember. They tried to take away the 
rich man. To give him to the poor. They killed cows,

10:59.118 --> 11:07.867
sheep, and the meat was distributed to the people 
who were in the farm or town. That's what they did.

11:11.070 --> 11:15.915
But your family spent all this time in your town, 
right? Yes. They didn't go to the United States.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.121
But your sister did. My sister was here. Yes. That 
was in 900... 13, 14. Yes. And are there soldiers in

11:30.750 --> 11:37.938
your town? During the Revolution, were there 
soldiers in your town? Well, in each place there

11:41.521 --> 11:51.492
was a group of soldiers because they kept the 
enemies from entering. Yes. And what kind of work

11:51.752 --> 11:54.635
did your father have? I don't remember. I was very 
young when he died. And your mother? Me too. I was

12:03.655 --> 12:10.464
four when my father died and I wasn't eight when my 
mother died. And after that, who do you live with?

12:14.870 --> 12:15.871
With an aunt. An aunt? What's your aunt's name? 
Good afternoon. Do you want to talk to

12:20.890 --> 12:29.563
her? Talk to her? About Mexico. She's recording. 
About Mexico? Why did you come here? It's to make

12:44.502 --> 12:54.036
the history of the people who live here in Texas

12:44.502 --> 12:54.036
better. Why did you come here? I don't know what to 
say. I know that I live better here than in Mexico.

13:03.109 --> 13:03.449
What? I live better here than in Mexico. Are you in 
Mexico? Is it better here? It's better here. Do you

13:07.965 --> 13:09.266
know Mexico? Yes, I know it. What part? Oh, many 
parts. I don't remember. I can tell you that I know

13:15.471 --> 13:21.897
many parts of Mexico, but I don't like it. No? I'm 
Mexican. Yes. But I don't like it. There's no life

13:27.722 --> 13:30.244
there. There's no life? Well, there's life, but 
there's no work. Ah. If you want to live, you have to

13:35.110 --> 13:41.318
live a very poor life. Yes. In Mexico, they give 
jobs to men aged 20 to 40, 45. Then, if they have to

13:50.611 --> 13:57.480
live, they live. And if they don't...

14:04.861 --> 14:05.181
See? Yes. A young boy, there is never work. Yes. He 
has to walk around the street selling tortillas,

14:12.892 --> 14:23.726
selling this or something to get a cent. Yes, but is 
there a lot of work here? Here, yes.

14:30.882 --> 14:32.826
Is he your son? No. Who is he? He's the only one. He's 
the only boy that's here. Sometimes he's here,

14:40.003 --> 14:44.393
sometimes he's there. But he works. Is he a 
relative or just a friend? Does he live here with

14:48.883 --> 14:50.106
you? Yes, and

14:50.879 --> 15:01.313
Brian? No.

15:18.908 --> 15:20.791
On one side of Franklin. Yes. And what year did you 
come here, Brian? Forty... Fifty. Forty-nine.

15:31.486 --> 15:33.028
Forty-nine in November. And for how many years did 
you live near Franklin?

15:42.521 --> 15:43.282
All the time. From 1930 to... And what kind of work 
did you have there? Work. Work. I used to work in the

15:53.651 --> 15:56.895
farm. At first, you know, take care of the cows. I 
worked in the farm, lived in the farm. Do you want me

16:03.184 --> 16:06.509
to speak to you in Spanish? Because she's... I 
don't speak Spanish. I don't speak Spanish. I

16:11.135 --> 16:11.976
speak English, too. Me too. Let them hear what 
you're saying. Oh, yes. Just a moment. You come

16:17.600 --> 16:22.466
here, you came here... I'm here. But you came here 
in 1901? In 1902? No, no, no, no. In 61. I came here.

16:39.892 --> 16:40.753
From which part? From which town? From the city of 
Acuña, Coahuila. Yes. And is it the town of your mom

16:44.999 --> 16:47.002
and dad? No. No? Where is this town? The city of 
Victoria, Tamaulipas. The city of Victoria, in

16:51.569 --> 16:53.712
the city. Ah, in the city. Yes. And why did you come 
here? Why did you come here? Well, first of all, I

16:58.939 --> 17:06.590
came... Well, there's something I shouldn't say. 
But... I don't have a father in Mexico.

17:14.932 --> 17:17.575
I have a mother. My mother lives with another man. 
That man doesn't love me. When I got to my age, I

17:25.422 --> 17:27.484
couldn't live with them. I understood that I 
couldn't live with them. I can make... I have to

17:36.293 --> 17:37.995
speak English. Well, I came here to look for my 
life. Yes.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.547
And did you have relatives here in Texas? Yes, I 
have relatives in San Antonio. Yes. They are from

17:52.929 --> 17:56.513
my mother's house. Yes. But I liked

17:57.494 --> 18:05.383
it here in Texas, how I worked. My bosses liked how I 
worked. The work I did, they paid for it. And they

18:08.964 --> 18:10.246
were satisfied. So I liked Texas. I had money to 
spend, to go whenever I wanted. And I never went

18:17.498 --> 18:21.745
back to Mexico.

18:24.870 --> 18:25.231
No. You want more

18:25.271 --> 18:29.498
here? I want more Texas than Mexico. It's not that 
I'm not Mexican, I am Mexican. Yes. I do want Mexico

18:35.682 --> 18:36.583
too. Yes. But I can't... I can't live in Mexico. 
Yes. Because I can't do it. I'm more imposed here

18:42.510 --> 18:43.992
than there. And for what reason do you come here? 
Did you come here to work? No, for an interest. I

18:51.102 --> 18:54.105
came to work, to make my life. Yes. To look for my 
life. Yes. Here in this town. But why did you come to

18:59.363 --> 19:07.290
Bryan, not San Antonio or San Marcos? Well, I was in 
different towns. I was in San Angelo, Abilene, in

19:08.971 --> 19:14.876
many towns. All of Texas, Oklahoma. I didn't 
distinguish a town, just because. I liked this

19:23.804 --> 19:24.664
town. When I came here to Bryan, all the people here 
saw me very well. I have a lot of friends and they

19:29.755 --> 19:36.282
love me as much as I love them. We've always

19:37.123 --> 19:42.769
been one for each other. I'm not leaving this town 
until I die. If not, I'm not leaving. It's a nice

19:49.817 --> 19:50.738
town. I like it a lot. There aren't many Mexicans 
like San Antonio. But it's more peaceful than San

19:55.810 --> 19:58.293
Antonio. Yes, it's smaller. It's smaller and 
there are fewer people. It's much more peaceful

20:04.622 --> 20:07.426
than San Antonio. I lived

20:07.506 --> 20:12.673
in San Antonio without my parents. I liked this 
town and I think I'm going to stay here. What kind of

20:17.539 --> 20:22.586
work do you have? I work in the Lincoln. All the work 
that... I don't have work to do right now. I have

20:28.761 --> 20:29.221
everything. I do everything. The same as him. He's 
from here, I'm from there. I should do what he does

20:38.054 --> 20:40.938
and I do it. With the time I have to be here, I never 
learned to work in Mexico. I didn't know how to work

20:44.202 --> 20:49.429
in Mexico because I never worked. This is where I 
learned to work. Like right now. If I came to

20:53.675 --> 20:55.618
Mexico, I would ask for work there. The work that I 
have here, they didn't give it to me. They wanted me

21:01.878 --> 21:05.284
to start from the bottom and then I would get to the 
top. No, no, not that, dad. I didn't even doubt it

21:09.371 --> 21:14.579
for about 15 years so that I could do it. But in 
Mexico now there are more opportunities for

21:14.599 --> 21:19.868
people than in the past? Yes, for those who have a 
school, yes. But is it necessary to have a school?

21:27.118 --> 21:29.401
It is necessary, yes. But the people who don't have 
a school can't do anything. I only had six years of

21:33.406 --> 21:35.629
school. Yes. That's all. There are people who have 
12 years. Young people who have, like the families

21:41.136 --> 21:47.463
of those who can't have money, they send them 12 
years, and they have a good job. When they finish

21:47.483 --> 21:51.188
school, they finish 20 years, and they get a good 
job. And I couldn't

21:51.674 --> 21:56.140
hold it. I'm very happy to be here in Texas. Well, 
not just here in Texas, but all over the United

21:59.925 --> 22:03.250
States. If I wasn't here, I'd be in another state, 
like I was in my family. Is life very different here

22:10.019 --> 22:12.583
in Mexico? It's very different. In what way is it 
different? With the same job, in what way is it

22:17.341 --> 22:19.965
different? No, no, no, in another way, not the job. 
The job is different. But in another way, in

22:23.890 --> 22:25.713
another way it's different. In another way I can't 
like Texas. Yes? Because there are a lot of

22:29.799 --> 22:38.111
festivities, a lot of festive days. And all that, 
you walk around and everything. Here no, here it's

22:41.335 --> 22:45.621
just the weekend, the sun. There in Mexico, no. 
between the week and the weekend.

22:53.522 --> 22:57.987
Every month we have a day, a holiday day. A lot of 
parties.

23:02.971 --> 23:05.133
A lot of parties. Mr. Lopez, are there a lot of 
parties in Mexico during these years when you

23:05.153 --> 23:14.922
lived there? Were there many parties in Mexico in 
the past? Yes. What kind of parties? There were

23:20.794 --> 23:30.085
dances and everything.

23:30.166 --> 23:32.909
People would dance and enjoy the dance. There were 
many. There aren't any here, but they're

23:35.072 --> 23:37.935
different. People do it as they're used to it. Yes.

24:12.192 --> 24:32.930
In your

24:12.192 --> 24:32.930
town, Mr. Lopez, in your ranch, what day of the year 
is the most important holiday? The 16th. The 16th

24:33.591 --> 24:35.453
of September. Other days? Two days. Two days. 
Fifteen and sixteen. Yes.

24:45.149 --> 24:47.593
May 5th.

24:48.895 --> 24:49.516
May 5th. February 24th. Yes. What's the day of the 
flag? What's the

24:55.024 --> 25:00.032
day of the flag? Flag Day. Flag Day. Yes. But there 
are church holidays. Huh? There are church

25:08.625 --> 25:09.807
holidays. Christmas

25:10.124 --> 25:23.257
Day, all the December fruits, all days, all 
nights. The Guadalupe Day. Guadalupe

25:25.559 --> 25:39.793
Day.

25:40.010 --> 25:49.357
Pastors all come to worship the Virgin of 
Guadalupe. On December 12. Y cuando usted estaba

25:52.177 --> 25:59.750
muy joven, viene a... Usted vive en rancho. En 
rancho se llaman... La Hacienda de Guadalupe. La

26:05.980 --> 26:08.605
Hacienda de Guadalupe. Y estaba cerca de... 
Linares. De Linares. Ah, yes, I know Linares. Is it

26:15.955 --> 26:20.439
on the side of the mountains or the sea? No, no, it's 
close to Monterrey and Nuevo León. Well, I know

26:25.744 --> 26:29.607
Linares and Monterrey. Well, it's close to 
Monterrey. At four in the morning, I would leave

26:32.030 --> 26:40.037
the house to get to the church at eight. Yes. On 
foot. On foot. In those years there was no voice.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.840
They had horses or carts. And they had nothing on 
foot. On foot. They walked. From your farm to

26:57.047 --> 26:59.450
Linares? To Linares. Two hours of walking. Yes. 
Two hours. Quite a lot.

27:13.227 --> 27:17.994
¿Y qué fue el pueblo más cerca de su hacienda?

27:21.859 --> 27:23.942
Tome López. Tome López. Tome López. Y Tome 
Lopillos. Son dos pueblos, dos ranchos juntos.

27:31.272 --> 27:31.332
Sí. Uno está en un lado del camino y el otro al otro 
lado. Sí. Tome López grande y Tome López chico. Sí.

27:38.542 --> 27:41.226
¿Y usted vivía en...? No, no. Señor. El Señor. 
Pueblo Nuevo. Pueblo Nuevo. Y cerca de estos

27:49.660 --> 27:52.222
pueblos.

27:56.887 --> 28:04.775
Y usted salió a los Estados Unidos antes de la 
Revolución?

28:04.975 --> 28:06.657
No, cuando... The Pancho Villa revolution was 
going on, so I came here. I was ten years old. So I

28:14.491 --> 28:20.437
came here, and I haven't come back, not even to the 
shore of the river. I don't like it there anymore.

28:25.622 --> 28:28.705
I'm already imposed here. You've been here for 
more than ten years. I'd like to go back to Mexico.

28:42.274 --> 28:46.179
I have my mother there. But it's very hard. She 
doesn't like it there anymore. It's very hard to

28:52.648 --> 28:54.690
live here. It's better to live here.

29:03.860 --> 29:11.470
Pero durante estos años de la revolución, ¿su 
familia tenía problemas o no? ¿Su familia en

29:11.911 --> 29:13.854
México? No. No. No. ¿Por qué no? No, vivían en el 
rancho. Sí. ¿Y no hay soldados o nada? No, había

29:22.425 --> 29:25.009
soldados en el pueblo. En cada esquina hay uno. En 
Darmes. Sí. En el pueblo, en cada esquina hay uno.

29:33.796 --> 29:35.819
All night long. They are there with their lanterns 
in the corners. And there are

29:40.345 --> 29:45.412
many soldiers. Many soldiers in each corner. Who 
knows

29:49.037 --> 29:55.906
now, but now everything is more populated. There 
in Mexico... When I was there, in every corner

30:01.167 --> 30:04.250
there was a gendarme. With his lantern, day and 
night. He was eating there. Who knows how it will be

30:10.117 --> 30:13.321
now? I don't give him any reason. From Mexico to the 
edge of the river, from the edge of the river to

30:14.962 --> 30:22.791
here. I haven't been to Mexico.

30:28.758 --> 30:37.246
And what kind of house did you live in in Mexico? A 
house made of adobe, made of earth. How many rooms?

30:49.457 --> 30:52.500
Two, three rooms, the kitchen and everything. Was 
there electricity? But there was no electricity.

31:00.389 --> 31:02.752
There were only lamps. Lamps like this one here. 
Electricity

31:07.418 --> 31:17.091
wasn't used

31:07.418 --> 31:17.091
there. How many people lived in your ranch in 
Mexico? No, it was a lot of people. A lot of people?

31:27.688 --> 31:28.929
100 or 200? It was a big town. There were two towns 
together. One was Tome López Grande and the other

31:35.355 --> 31:40.600
was Tome López Chico. They were like here, but 
there was only the street. And over there was a

31:46.625 --> 31:52.410
ranch and over here was another one.

31:56.120 --> 32:01.607
There was a lot of people.

32:06.076 --> 32:08.659
Hello. Hello. I'm Mary Lee Nolan.

32:33.768 --> 32:37.713
Look,

32:33.768 --> 32:37.713
look! Where's Johnny? Hey,

32:39.956 --> 32:51.670
Johnny!

32:51.771 --> 32:53.893
What's up, Mommy? Nothing.

32:58.239 --> 33:01.222
What time is it, honey? It's five. How

33:05.138 --> 33:13.067
many children do you have? Well, I have several. 
Five men. Five men? And six women. Six women? Oh,

33:18.753 --> 33:20.155
eleven? Eleven children? And each child has six, 
seven, five... Oh, you have many grandchildren.

33:30.826 --> 33:31.467
Forty-one. Forty-one grandchildren.

33:38.707 --> 33:40.991
And 16... How do you say it? Sons-in-law.

33:44.215 --> 33:46.538
Sons-in-law? No, just daughters.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.209
Oh, daughters. Stepdaughters. Ah, yes. There are 
16 grandchildren. Yes. You are the second wife

33:58.515 --> 34:00.998
of... And your first wife is from Mexico or from 
here? From here. From here. Do you marry her after

34:05.952 --> 34:12.221
you come to the United States? Yes. We'll be 
waiting for you. For what? Yes. To win the food. How

34:18.309 --> 34:23.216
do you fight? Look how she brings the boots. Didn't 
she tell you what she did with the boots? Le dije que

34:31.336 --> 34:34.692
fuera a poner la junta del calentón, ya ves como 
andan mojadas ayer. He pones clothes to the heater

34:35.254 --> 34:37.344
pa que se sequen. He put them on top of the heater.
