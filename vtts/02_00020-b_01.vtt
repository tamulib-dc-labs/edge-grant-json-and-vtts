00:02.815 --> 00:16.731
family background as to geography, small towns, large towns, rich, poor, academic major, whatever, were the people that came to see you a cross-section of the student body?

00:18.293 --> 00:20.155
Well, I would say reasonably.

00:21.857 --> 00:28.705
You tended to get, given the College of Liberal Arts was much smaller than it is now,

00:29.073 --> 00:32.276
But you tended to get a higher proportion of liberal arts majors.

00:33.758 --> 00:40.024
Because, you know, their majors are English philosophy, who am I, where am I, what am I doing here, all of those.

00:40.605 --> 00:48.993
You got less of, given the total number of students, you got less of a group of engineering students in.

00:49.794 --> 00:55.640
And engineering, I hate to stereotype, a lot of engineering students operate very much from the neck up.

00:56.381 --> 00:58.303
They can tell you exactly, in fact, I had a

00:58.840 --> 01:08.412
a young man whose girlfriend broke up with him, and he kept saying, I don't think she should have, and I kept saying, well, when she did such and such, how did it make you feel

01:08.847 --> 01:13.053
And he stopped me and he said, what does it make any difference what I felt?

01:13.073 --> 01:20.343
And I said, well, in psychology, we have a feeling, a notion that your feelings are as valid a source of knowledge as your head is often.

01:21.024 --> 01:22.926
And it might be helpful.

01:23.487 --> 01:29.455
But anyway, yeah, you got a more disproportionate number from majors where

01:29.435 --> 01:38.125
where people are in majors that are not as defined as mathematics and engineering and chemistry and all that kind of thing.

01:38.546 --> 01:47.457
As far as their economic background, we really, when a student came to us, we really had no information on their socioeconomic status.

01:47.837 --> 01:58.750
And as A&M grew, it became more of an institution where people came from large urban areas, so I'm sure that that was reflected in our data.

01:59.219 --> 02:15.330
But I would say it was more, initially you got more of the male loading because males were the preponderance of the population, but it didn't take long to shift again to the female because women, it's okay for women in our society to use calcetic services more than men.

02:15.350 --> 02:16.652
It's not a sign of weakness to them.

02:17.254 --> 02:20.620
And then you got more of the difference in the academic majors and that.

02:21.308 --> 02:30.039
At the end of say the first year, there must have been some kind of evaluation or feedback report you got from Koldis or somebody.

02:31.161 --> 02:39.151
How did you feel at the end of the first measurement point?

02:39.692 --> 02:49.324
In those days, I don't remember us being under the pressure of a formal annual performance review.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.508
I don't remember John doing those with me.

02:56.791 --> 03:06.807
With John, it wasn't very hard to know when you were doing fine because in my relationship with him,

03:06.787 --> 03:11.333
he would kid around a lot and even do some put-down humor.

03:11.373 --> 03:19.282
Like he'd introduce me to people and say, this is Wade Birch, Director of Student Counseling Services, and I screwed up and hired him twice, once at East Texas and one here.

03:19.703 --> 03:25.710
If John didn't do that with me, I would get concerned and wonder, was I not doing something well?

03:26.251 --> 03:30.456
But I don't remember Haskell any formal review.

03:30.516 --> 03:33.199
He must have been picking up

03:34.023 --> 03:47.428
information, because I know he would even ask me in our meetings, what was I hearing about the student center, what was I hearing around campus about this, that, and so I'm sure he was gathering information informally, but I never got a formal performance review back in those days.

03:47.548 --> 03:50.353
Did he give you any verbal, hey, keep it up?

03:50.734 --> 03:57.246
Oh, yeah, yes, absolutely, yeah, things are going well, yeah, and with John, John was

03:57.412 --> 03:59.517
Like many of us, no news is good news.

04:01.281 --> 04:07.275
There must have been some kind of salary increase that was performance-based, in fact.

04:07.777 --> 04:08.699
Yeah, right.

04:09.561 --> 04:15.555
I remember our first or second year here, the legislature gave us a mid-year

04:15.535 --> 04:19.841
bonus or something, and I was heady with the amount of money.

04:19.862 --> 04:20.863
I think I jumped to $25,000.

04:20.883 --> 04:22.926
It was just astounding.

04:23.427 --> 04:28.274
In your first two or three years, a work week was what?

04:29.115 --> 04:40.092
Work week was clearly the university work week, eight to five, and then we very soon thereafter knew that we needed to share nighttime and weekend emergency duty.

04:40.477 --> 04:53.275
And so initially, and John the second year gave me two more positions, so we were up to five, and so we set up a system where the health center would call us in a particular order, and we had an arrangement.

04:53.295 --> 04:53.455
At home?

04:53.716 --> 04:53.956
Yes.

04:54.457 --> 04:56.239
And would you sometimes come to the campus?

04:56.259 --> 04:56.940
Oh, absolutely.

04:57.381 --> 05:05.472
What were the kinds of matters that would... Usually people suffering depression, extreme anxiety, suicidal ideation,

05:05.587 --> 05:08.212
And they would have gone to the campus?

05:08.233 --> 05:14.465
Yeah, and if they didn't go directly to the health center, they would make their presence known to somebody else who would get them to the health center.

05:14.586 --> 05:22.963
Our whole system then was always, we preach this and talk, get them to the health center, get them to the health center.

05:22.983 --> 05:25.789
The health center was open seven days a week, 24 hours a day at that point.

05:26.056 --> 05:34.699
And that was good because then we could meet them on a Sunday afternoon or a Monday morning at 2 a.m.

05:34.739 --> 05:36.825
because we had nurses and a physician around.

05:36.885 --> 05:39.492
Other than that,

05:39.792 --> 05:45.799
That changed after the health center terminated its seven day a week, 24 hour day services.

05:45.859 --> 05:52.868
Now we have to have students taken down to the local hospital emergency rooms because I have no place to send our staff member in the middle of the night.

05:53.408 --> 05:58.274
And I don't want a female staff psychologist seeing a kid in this building when it's dark.

05:58.294 --> 06:00.737
Of course, we also have a major helpline.

06:00.717 --> 06:10.492
With that night duty, can you give an extreme example of a serious and a goofy?

06:11.253 --> 06:11.914
Oh, yeah.

06:12.695 --> 06:20.407
I had one woman, a female student, who called me and I answered the phone.

06:20.427 --> 06:22.029
I think it was around 3.20 a.m.

06:25.655 --> 06:27.838
The health center had given my number and she called me.

06:28.662 --> 06:33.449
One of the first words out of her mouth was, did I awaken you?

06:35.592 --> 06:43.963
You know, the funny part of me, you know, internal was, well, no, I've been sitting here waiting for somebody's call.

06:44.043 --> 06:45.605
You know, of course you did, you know.

06:45.685 --> 06:48.990
And I said, well, I had, but I was very civil.

06:49.030 --> 06:53.977
I said, well, I was sleeping, but I knew that people would call if they had need, you know, and that kind of thing.

06:53.997 --> 06:54.798
But I always remember that.

06:55.279 --> 06:56.340
I do remember...

06:56.860 --> 07:12.137
also getting involved with another female student, I think a graduate student, older female student, who I had received word that she was threatening suicide, and I called the college station police to go out and do a welfare check.

07:13.198 --> 07:21.727
And I had talked to her, and she would not give me, prior to them doing the welfare check, she would not give me any assurances over the phone that she would not harm herself.

07:22.248 --> 07:24.230
That's when I called the college, and she hung up on me.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.331
I called the college station police.

07:25.652 --> 07:26.833
They went out, checked on her.

07:28.045 --> 07:33.453
About 15, 10 minutes after she left, the police left, she called me and she cussed me out.

07:33.673 --> 07:35.256
I mean, I've heard some words.

07:35.957 --> 07:38.861
I think there was at least one cuss word I had not heard of before.

07:39.142 --> 07:42.547
And man, she let me have it that I had sent the police out there.

07:42.587 --> 07:51.420
And I remember telling her, I said, I need you to understand that in my life I have decided that I would rather have you angry at me than dead.

07:51.451 --> 07:58.378
And I will now lay my head on the pillow tonight much more comfortably than I would have had I not taken that precaution.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.443
Do you remember what her response to that was?

08:02.883 --> 08:05.386
She was not very happy with me no matter what I said.

08:05.426 --> 08:07.888
Not at all.

08:07.908 --> 08:08.509
It was interesting.

08:08.569 --> 08:09.210
I can imagine.

08:09.890 --> 08:16.457
In those early years, did corps members tend to show up in the similar per capita?

08:16.738 --> 08:17.138
No.

08:17.607 --> 08:27.541
Less, much less and I think that's just a reflection of the A&M culture at that time and generally society.

08:27.602 --> 08:35.453
I mean counseling was starting to really take off in the 60s and 70s but not to the degree it is today.

08:35.493 --> 08:40.240
And campus students compared to off campus.

08:40.507 --> 08:46.373
Oh, that began mirroring, reflecting whatever the demographics were of the university.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.997
In subsequent years, it's amazing.

08:50.057 --> 08:54.141
We see about an equal proportion of freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior.

08:54.161 --> 09:02.590
I would have expected a heavy loading of freshmen and sophomores, but we see a pretty equal spread, and then we'll see an equal number of graduate students.

09:04.512 --> 09:06.634
So that's kind of interesting.

09:06.674 --> 09:09.417
I think most people would think you'd see the younger students more.

09:09.397 --> 09:14.502
If compared to other institutions, do you think that would be similar to the realities elsewhere?

09:15.183 --> 09:19.387
Probably to a fair number of them, particularly residential campuses, yeah.

09:19.847 --> 09:20.908
Yeah.

09:21.829 --> 09:27.995
And let's see, were there any realities that you expected here that you didn't encounter?

09:31.278 --> 09:31.759
Hmm, boy.

09:32.760 --> 09:38.205
We'll need to do this, this, and this, and we'll need to help with that or that, but the situation didn't occur?

09:40.379 --> 09:43.342
In preparing for things that never materialized?

09:46.905 --> 09:51.650
For the kinds of problems that students would have that they didn't have here?

09:56.635 --> 10:09.728
No, other than my somewhat noticing that the degree of academic competitiveness caused some greater stress, depression, and anxiety and

10:10.113 --> 10:34.129
occasionally those things of stealing lab notes or preventing somebody from setting the curve, I think the A&M students with that increasing civilian population were not too dissimilar, other than I do remember distinctly how polite the students were, no sir, yes sir, which was always amazing to me.

10:34.480 --> 10:39.766
But no, nothing that I, I don't remember anything that caught me off guard and that kind of thing.

10:39.786 --> 10:44.011
See now, and to the student typist, this you need not put in there.

10:44.051 --> 10:45.873
This is just a personal opinion coming up.

10:46.034 --> 10:46.274
Sure.

10:47.275 --> 10:53.122
I have the impression that this campus is more friendly than most, even today.

10:53.222 --> 10:54.804
Yeah.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.167
Whether it's male or female, civilian or military.

10:57.187 --> 10:57.847
Yes.

10:57.867 --> 10:59.710
But I'm guessing it's a chicken and egg.

10:59.870 --> 11:03.774
I'm guessing the kind of kid that selects A&M in the first place.

11:03.854 --> 11:04.335
Yeah.

11:05.243 --> 11:11.251
comes from that kind of mental background that I'm glad it does.

11:11.491 --> 11:11.692
Yeah.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.553
I'm glad they're here.

11:12.653 --> 11:12.913
Yes.

11:13.374 --> 11:19.943
But I'm not sure A&M created it, but it helps to encourage that it continues.

11:20.023 --> 11:20.323
Yeah.

11:20.804 --> 11:28.054
Well, first response is there's no question the friendliness on this campus is marvelous.

11:28.394 --> 11:32.179
And I hear some of the old ag saying, well, it's not as good as it used to be.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.341
I don't know.

11:33.361 --> 11:34.742
I don't know how you measure that.

11:34.762 --> 11:40.309
I don't know if that's true, but it's an incredibly friendly and supportive place.

11:40.429 --> 11:44.894
I go back up to the campus at Indiana University and I just naturally say hello to people on the sidewalk.

11:45.795 --> 11:49.399
Even in the Midwest, we're not talking about the East, New York.

11:49.439 --> 11:53.443
Even in the Midwest, my wife is nudging me and saying, hey, you know, you don't do that.

11:53.584 --> 11:54.485
You don't do those.

11:54.605 --> 11:57.508
People look at it like, what do you want, you know, kind of thing.

11:57.488 --> 11:59.271
So it's incredible.

11:59.491 --> 12:09.448
And the core, the kind of spirit they set up, which I think all of this flows from, bless them for that.

12:09.949 --> 12:11.051
And I think you're right.

12:11.091 --> 12:23.952
I think kids who are inclined to attach and otherwise become part of something are going to really be drawn to a school with this value system.

12:24.370 --> 12:30.656
So in those early months and years, you didn't think about having made a mistake.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.160
And how long did you think you'd be here?

12:35.900 --> 12:41.145
Oh, well, at East Texas, I thought two or three years and I'd be back in Florida.

12:42.546 --> 12:48.411
When I got to A&M and the chance to work with Coldus again, it was a different ball game.

12:48.471 --> 12:53.736
Now, you just reminded me, I did apply for a job at University of Texas at San Antonio.

12:54.796 --> 13:01.466
And they offered me the directorship, the same salary, and an associate professor rank, which I had an assistant professor rank here.

13:02.447 --> 13:06.853
And, but the only reason I did that was I happened to have been single at that point.

13:07.955 --> 13:12.421
And the social life here was devastatingly bad.

13:13.603 --> 13:19.251
I, when I, East Texas State, the largest department in the university was the counseling department.

13:19.653 --> 13:22.758
And East Texas State at that time was an inverted pyramid.

13:22.818 --> 13:24.761
The graduate school was the largest part of it.

13:25.201 --> 13:26.183
And then it funneled down.

13:26.283 --> 13:33.434
So the dating opportunities and social life were wonderful there, even though it was a town of 9,000 and a school of 9,000.

13:33.454 --> 13:38.060
And I thought when I came to A&M, oh, my goodness, it's just going to be better.

13:38.541 --> 13:39.883
This is a bigger school, bigger place.

13:39.943 --> 13:41.686
It was rough.

13:41.706 --> 13:42.407
It was hard.

13:42.928 --> 13:45.812
And so the only reason I ever did

13:46.552 --> 13:50.256
do that was because I thought social opportunities would be much better in San Antonio.

13:50.497 --> 13:55.743
I remember John Coldis was a bit taken aback that I had done that.

13:56.384 --> 14:01.730
I think he took that a bit personally and I can understand that, you know, but it was purely social reasons.

14:02.331 --> 14:11.682
But ultimately I was offered the job there and didn't take it because I knew professionally this was a far better place to be, far, far better.

14:12.623 --> 14:16.508
And as far as meeting a woman in my life, it only takes one.

14:17.011 --> 14:20.295
and so I clearly made the right choice.

14:20.335 --> 14:26.501
How did you enlarge your social opportunities here other than softball?

14:28.403 --> 14:30.806
Gee, gee, gee, gee.

14:31.407 --> 14:39.255
Well, I do remember going, I remember, I don't remember that my social life became amazingly more rich here, to be honest with you.

14:40.497 --> 14:43.660
Instead of going back to commerce every three or four weekends,

14:43.927 --> 14:47.052
I found myself down in Houston every third weekend or so.

14:47.272 --> 14:49.716
But then again, part of that was for shopping too at that time.

14:50.036 --> 14:52.921
Byron College Station I think had a combined population of 50,000.

14:53.481 --> 14:58.749
So I was down in Houston a lot for ball games and concerts and all those kinds of things.

14:59.651 --> 15:07.182
I don't know that, I mean that group of softball friends, that got wider and wider.

15:07.242 --> 15:11.048
Ron Blatchley and folks like that.

15:12.007 --> 15:14.951
And that created a social circle, too.

15:16.473 --> 15:18.295
Sort of the concentric rings went out.

15:20.037 --> 15:22.320
And then student affairs people that I got to know.

15:22.460 --> 15:25.044
That pretty much was the core of my social life.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.787
You had an assistant professor.

15:27.987 --> 15:29.429
What were your duties over there?

15:29.830 --> 15:32.874
Oh, I just taught one course, one graduate course in counseling.

15:33.014 --> 15:33.554
Per year?

15:34.355 --> 15:34.996
Per semester.

15:35.016 --> 15:35.517
Per semester.

15:35.537 --> 15:36.018
Yeah.

15:36.038 --> 15:40.343
And the interesting thing was that I was paid no more.

15:40.913 --> 15:50.615
In those days, I wanted academic rank, I wanted to teach, and John said, fine, as long as you run the counseling service properly, you can certainly go do that.

15:51.177 --> 16:00.137
And Ed Psych started off paying me one-third of my salary, then I got it reduced to one-fourth.

16:01.231 --> 16:02.654
Boy, this is one of those ticklish things.

16:02.895 --> 16:09.451
The faculty at that time were a different breed of cat for me.

16:10.333 --> 16:14.203
And I guess this is true of academics.

16:14.885 --> 16:17.230
We would keep hashing over the same issues.

16:17.571 --> 16:19.155
I remember Lannis Hope.

16:19.135 --> 16:24.161
I remember him putting his hands in his head one time and saying, folks, we've been talking about this for eight months.

16:24.662 --> 16:26.344
Let's just do something.

16:26.885 --> 16:30.349
And I was saying in my head, yes, Lannis, yes.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.571
You know, and that kind of thing.

16:31.591 --> 16:42.245
So I actually, what really happened primarily was this center began getting bigger and bigger and more complex to where I was working so many nights.

16:42.265 --> 16:43.226
So it was getting crazy.

16:43.486 --> 16:45.649
And I had to give up the teaching part.

16:46.169 --> 16:52.717
When you did it, was that a good, for you professionally, was that a good outlet?

16:53.558 --> 16:55.180
The teaching?

16:55.700 --> 16:57.743
I really enjoyed teaching.

16:57.823 --> 17:00.546
I enjoy the part of interacting with students.

17:00.646 --> 17:01.587
I'll be candid with you.

17:02.128 --> 17:05.612
I would rather deal with a student in suicidal crisis than I would read a term paper.

17:06.433 --> 17:07.334
I mean, that's honest.

17:07.394 --> 17:11.018
I'd rather take the unknown of a suicidal crisis over reading a term paper.

17:11.999 --> 17:15.023
So the classroom part of it I really enjoyed a lot.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.024
The preparation.

17:16.392 --> 17:22.440
I had taught those courses before at East Texas State and at Indiana, and so I was pretty well prepared.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.083
They had me teach the same class each time.

17:24.824 --> 17:26.226
So, but I enjoyed it.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.307
I did it for about four years.

17:28.028 --> 17:37.301
See, I've always thought what a healthy thing it is to have the real world practitioner teach the course which is filled with theory.

17:37.441 --> 17:39.524
Yes, totally agree.

17:39.624 --> 17:42.128
This may be what the textbook says, however.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.550
Yeah, right.

17:43.970 --> 17:45.252
Oh, you're right on target.

17:45.434 --> 17:48.474
All right, so you all were in the Y. Right.

17:49.239 --> 17:51.192
And that lasted about how long?

17:51.340 --> 17:54.123
We were in the YMCA building on different floors.

17:54.223 --> 17:57.145
We bounced up and down until 1994.

17:57.165 --> 17:58.406
Oh, so yeah.

17:59.047 --> 18:00.508
Yeah, we were in there a long time.

18:00.548 --> 18:03.031
We started out with a few corner offices and third floor.

18:03.651 --> 18:07.735
Then as John got more positions, we took over part of the basement.

18:07.875 --> 18:14.101
The basement was interesting because when we'd have serious rainfall, the counseling center would flood.

18:14.141 --> 18:21.027
We'd have an inch or an inch and a half of water and a physical plant would come over with the water vacuums and our clients would be sloshing through the water.

18:21.007 --> 18:38.878
Finally, it was very interesting to me that after we moved back up to the third floor, where we got the whole floor, right after that, I think Business Affairs or Human Resources got that, and all of a sudden the university dug out all the dirt around that area and fixed it all up to prevent flooding.

18:39.379 --> 18:45.630
But while we were in it, maybe this is the Student Affairs feeling like the underdog, but it didn't happen while we were in there.

18:45.728 --> 18:52.264
If I'm not mistaken, wasn't there, once upon a time in the deep past, an indoor swimming pool?

18:52.284 --> 18:53.206
Yes, there was a pool.

18:53.567 --> 18:53.747
Yep.

18:54.650 --> 18:55.131
Yep.

18:55.171 --> 18:59.762
You could walk over the floor and hear the resonance was different.

18:59.822 --> 19:03.872
That's what I thought.

19:03.852 --> 19:16.353
Were there any signals from the president or the board or anybody on the outside that caused you to think that, okay, we are making progress and they recognize it?

19:17.455 --> 19:18.296
Never really.

19:18.657 --> 19:23.785
I'll be honest with you, Haskell.

19:25.199 --> 19:40.883
I have always had kind of a, and this is not necessarily good, I've always had a somewhat of an arms length cautious relationship with college presidents and board members.

19:41.004 --> 19:45.671
I've never gone out of my way to interact with them.

19:45.691 --> 19:46.071
Oh, I understand.

19:46.212 --> 19:50.278
Again, it's like the Morth getting too close to the flame.

19:50.748 --> 19:53.132
But I never got any signal.

19:53.472 --> 19:55.135
I always took my cues through John.

19:55.976 --> 20:00.344
And I really did follow his advice of be careful, stay out of that stuff.

20:00.364 --> 20:03.949
If something needs to be done or you need to know something, I'll let you know what it is.

20:04.410 --> 20:06.173
And I trusted John just greatly.

20:06.353 --> 20:09.959
And so it was amazing.

20:09.979 --> 20:16.310
I remember one time during a budget hearing, and I don't know how high the A&M budget is when it's stacked, but it's pretty big.

20:16.430 --> 20:17.852
And I remember John calling me.

20:18.541 --> 20:29.042
on the phone and I was interrupted from some meeting and he said, he used to call me Wado and he said, Wado, he said, why did I agree to do this for your department?

20:29.644 --> 20:30.986
You know, he needed a quick round.

20:31.006 --> 20:35.335
And suddenly, I mean, I thought, my God, the Board of Regents,

20:35.872 --> 20:39.800
You know, I viewed the counseling service as a pimple on the fanny of the institution.

20:39.840 --> 20:46.633
You know, we were insignificant and small, and here he is calling from a board meeting, stepping out and saying, hey, I need the rationale for what we did.

20:47.073 --> 20:48.436
So I was really surprised at that.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.602
I don't even remember what the matter was, frankly, but I was surprised.

20:51.582 --> 20:56.368
So I never really got any feedback from that level.

20:56.448 --> 20:59.472
You never got one of those legendary brief notes from Jack Williams?

20:59.792 --> 21:00.773
No, never.

21:01.134 --> 21:12.628
See, what was so superb about him, if you, at a faculty meeting, ask an appropriate question,

21:13.115 --> 21:21.651
Or if he saw that you had done something splendid, you'd get this note that you'd want, and it was handwritten, you'd kill.

21:22.412 --> 21:28.904
And for me, the epitome of all of this was I was the speaker at his inauguration for the faculty.

21:29.505 --> 21:33.332
There had been no faculty involvement at all in his selection.

21:33.693 --> 21:33.994
Wow.

21:34.475 --> 21:36.338
And we were all just .

21:36.757 --> 21:44.665
But then he turned out to be so superb and the inauguration, he'd come November 1, the inauguration is I think the first week in May.

21:45.966 --> 21:47.687
How I got selected I do not know.

21:48.808 --> 22:04.063
And at the end of saying what a great job he was doing, what a great start he was off to and so forth, I turned to Clyde Wells, the chairman of the board, and I said in speaking for the faculty, sir, I want to summarize what I've been trying to say.

22:05.242 --> 22:10.564
Speaking for the faculty, not even a faculty committee could have found a better person.

22:11.006 --> 22:15.505
Clyde Wells and the board didn't think that was funny at all.

22:17.138 --> 22:21.783
Well, the next day I was walking back from the MSC and I heard this horn.

22:21.924 --> 22:22.204
Yeah.

22:22.905 --> 22:24.466
And this arm motioning.

22:24.787 --> 22:26.369
Then I realized it was Jack Williams.

22:26.389 --> 22:27.490
Yeah.

22:27.510 --> 22:30.974
And he said, hey, that was great.

22:30.994 --> 22:32.235
And he handed me the note.

22:32.556 --> 22:33.557
Oh, no kidding.

22:33.757 --> 22:34.438
Which said that.

22:34.538 --> 22:37.241
Well, of course, that was a treasure of treasure.

22:37.622 --> 22:37.982
Oh, yes.

22:38.002 --> 22:38.803
All right.

22:38.823 --> 22:41.866
In those early years, you thought progress was being made.

22:42.027 --> 22:42.387
Yeah.

22:42.367 --> 22:43.530
Yeah.

22:43.831 --> 22:52.194
How did you think, as far as you were aware of what was going on at other major public universities, were we headed in the right direction?

22:52.214 --> 22:52.936
Were we following?

22:53.578 --> 22:56.325
Yeah, we were really,

22:57.689 --> 23:03.115
We were really playing catch-up, but we were doing it at an amazingly fast pace.

23:03.296 --> 23:17.573
My impression of A&M has always been that if you can finally convince the powers that be with the resources of the validity of your idea, boy, that when A&M gets behind something, they do it first class.

23:17.693 --> 23:18.754
I mean, it moves.

23:19.115 --> 23:26.143
And so we went from, like I mentioned when I'd go back to my national meeting, people hadn't even heard of A&M.

23:26.478 --> 23:32.967
And now we're sitting here and we're one of the, Tom Magoon is our great, he's a director emeritus at University of Maryland.

23:33.608 --> 23:39.656
He flushes out all the data from all the counseling centers, just extracts out the big 20 and we're one of the big 20.

23:39.996 --> 23:47.727
So we grew up very rapidly, very rapidly to where now we sit with the Michigan states, the Minnesotas, the Ohio states, Texas.

23:47.791 --> 23:52.415
Now, you're saying top 20 public or public and private?

23:52.496 --> 23:53.256
Public and private.

23:53.276 --> 23:53.857
Public and private.

23:53.877 --> 23:55.498
Yeah, although the preponderance are public.

23:55.538 --> 23:56.640
Yes, yes.

23:56.660 --> 24:02.725
And that's big 20, not necessarily in quality, but in size, which indicates a lot, yeah.

24:03.786 --> 24:14.777
And was there anything in those years, those earlier years, that you thought we should try to do that

24:14.757 --> 24:15.758
Nobody accepted?

24:16.279 --> 24:35.925
Well, I was always concerned with our lack of minority student enrollment because I had been at, well, East Texas State, it had a higher than typical enrollment of minority students.

24:36.006 --> 24:37.828
Indiana University had probably

24:38.973 --> 25:00.407
Oh well I'm not sure it even magnified or reflected the state's demographics and African-American students up north tend to be a different breed than down here and that but I know I would always wince when I would go and see friends in other places in Texas and they would make the writing comments about A&M's

25:00.843 --> 25:09.057
you know, white, overwhelming white population and that kind of hurt me because I knew how so much was good here.

25:10.259 --> 25:22.480
I remember the second year I was here I went to talk to the Black Awareness Committee and there were 40 black students and I remember saying, gee, it's good to see all of you here

25:23.101 --> 25:26.385
Because I haven't had that since I was up at East Texas State.

25:26.966 --> 25:29.029
And they just clapped and cheered, you know.

25:29.069 --> 25:34.656
I mean, they must have felt really, you know, just very, very minority group, you know.

25:34.716 --> 25:51.437
And my impression was some of the earlier presidents, not Jack Williams, but after him, I sense some reasonable lip service to diversity, but I'm not sure that I ever believed it.

25:51.772 --> 26:01.947
Now, interestingly, Frank Vandiver did get me, bless his heart, a specific funding for an Hispanic counselor and an African-American counselor.

26:03.089 --> 26:12.143
But I think starting with Bill Mobley, I began to feel more of an honest interest and commitment to that.

26:12.967 --> 26:19.759
Because, you know, I'm always so overwhelmingly aware of the fact that this institution belongs to the public, the state of Texas.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.686
And I know it has vested interest groups, alumni and legacy groups.

26:24.627 --> 26:30.638
But it always seemed to me that we should have been doing a little more a little earlier.

26:32.002 --> 26:38.809
Sometimes, too, though, I also think that you've got to take those things slow when you begin to change a culture.

26:38.849 --> 26:43.574
If you do it too abruptly, rough things happen.

26:43.594 --> 26:47.438
And I've always been an evolutionary on this campus.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.641
I've known people on the faculty who were revolutionaries.

26:51.102 --> 26:52.183
They did wonderful things.

26:52.203 --> 26:53.264
They carried the banner.

26:53.765 --> 26:56.287
They were slaughtered, died, left, moved on.

26:56.427 --> 27:00.912
I was grateful for what they did, and I reaped their benefits because I'm an evolutionary.

27:01.246 --> 27:04.253
I'm a quiet persister, like with psychiatric services.

27:04.453 --> 27:09.505
I try to be very civil, but I'm kind of like herpes.

27:09.585 --> 27:10.347
I won't go away.

27:10.487 --> 27:15.038
I keep coming back, and I'll keep coming back appropriately and at the right time.

27:15.118 --> 27:18.225
And usually that's worked here.

27:19.083 --> 27:33.499
How often, in all of your A&M years, how often did a minority student's problem relate to their minority background?

27:33.519 --> 27:38.765
Oh.

27:39.005 --> 27:42.829
Hard for me to, you know, I can't quote statistics or anything.

27:43.282 --> 27:46.387
would be more of just an experiential feel.

27:46.547 --> 27:55.521
I would say that it was a fair proportion of the time it had something to do with their racial background.

27:55.542 --> 28:05.798
And how often was it because of some treatment they had received here because of their... Oh, yeah, that definitely happened.

28:05.818 --> 28:10.926
Do you have any idea whether it would be better or worse here than other places?

28:10.906 --> 28:22.959
Well, you know, present day, I think that probably the group of students who have it the hardest here are probably the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered students.

28:23.800 --> 28:28.345
The second hardest group I think for here would be the African-American student.

28:29.646 --> 28:35.292
Those are the two that really, and we've had, I know, reported to staff all kinds of things.

28:36.013 --> 28:38.736
I mean, sometimes the behavior is subtle.

28:39.745 --> 28:41.170
Subtly discriminatory.

28:41.190 --> 28:51.207
I mean sometimes it's overt like garbage being left in front of your door or feces or something like that Signs tacked up on doors

28:51.845 --> 28:56.613
treatment in the community, but there are things that happen.

28:56.993 --> 29:02.963
I've got a clinical psychology intern right now from the University of North Carolina who had garbage left in front.

29:02.983 --> 29:04.606
She's an African-American Ph.D.

29:04.626 --> 29:09.874
student, had garbage left in front of her door at her apartment complex at College Station in the year 2001.

29:10.295 --> 29:10.755
Oh my.

29:10.775 --> 29:14.241
Yeah, because I didn't think that was happening anymore.

29:14.947 --> 29:21.098
And you have no idea of how our realities compare on a per capita basis with other institutions?

29:21.639 --> 29:24.424
No, I just presume there's prejudice all over.

29:25.266 --> 29:37.107
But I think my impression would be that this would be a tougher environment to crack because of its all-white, male, Texas conservative culture.

29:37.424 --> 29:53.779
I mean, the African-American students at Indiana University were much more assertive, believed that they belonged there, that it wasn't a gift, that they had a right to be there, which was not the feeling that I got when I moved to Texas.

29:54.079 --> 30:07.431
It was to some degree, you know, well, we're kind of lucky we've been allowed to, you know, but it was a very down, very much a one-down feeling, whereas up at IU, it was, you know, I have every right to be here.

30:09.031 --> 30:10.317
All right.

30:12.305 --> 30:28.643
Were you aware of any changes in administrative concern for the Counseling Center as Williams became Jarvis Miller, as Miller became Vandiver, as Vandiver became Mobley?

30:28.663 --> 30:28.983
Yeah.

30:29.864 --> 30:31.666
It sounds crazy.

30:32.207 --> 30:37.192
I was never basically impacted by that, and I think it was because of John Coldis.

30:38.193 --> 30:40.776
I was shielded, and again,

30:41.347 --> 30:43.170
My own failings.

30:43.431 --> 30:54.131
I never sought out to make an impression on a president or be political or schmooze.

30:54.151 --> 30:54.952
I just never did it.

30:54.993 --> 31:01.284
I tried to stay very professional and not make a big splash, not make a big scene.

31:01.304 --> 31:02.467
That was almost from day one.

31:02.807 --> 31:04.350
That was our modus operandi.

31:04.837 --> 31:09.141
And I know if we had screwed up, we'd have heard something for that question.

31:09.402 --> 31:14.026
But on the other hand, you got no directions, don't touch this, stay out of that.

31:14.367 --> 31:15.248
No, I was never.

31:15.688 --> 31:19.492
In fact, I remember we have a group of tapes, Haskell.

31:19.512 --> 31:20.913
Right now, students can call in.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.175
We have about 60 of them.

31:22.295 --> 31:29.562
And they're three- to five-minute vignettes, everything from how to cue drop a course to how to fight fair and mad.
