WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:16.852
But the numbers were still real small at 28,000 
during that time frame, just as the numbers were

00:03.878 --> 00:16.852
small with regard to blacks and all those things.

00:19.075 --> 00:26.062
As you became involved, who did you get early on? 
Did someone help you get? assigned as a student

00:29.039 --> 00:34.026
body government assistant or anything? No, 
because I jumped right into it. I jumped right into

00:36.350 --> 00:51.992
it because that fall of my freshman year,

00:36.350 --> 00:51.992
fall of 1973, I ran

00:36.350 --> 00:51.992
for, I immediately ran for a freshman class 
senator from the College of Agriculture. So I kind

00:54.962 --> 00:59.767
of never was a fish aid or none of that kind of stuff. 
I really never served a full term as a senator. I

01:03.891 --> 01:05.252
mean, I never did. Some of the student body leaders 
were encouraged through Wayne Stark and the MSC.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.202
Others were core. So you're part of another group. 
Yes. And there were some things in place,

01:19.045 --> 01:21.928
actually, except they didn't come into play until 
I served as student vice president, but there were

01:22.313 --> 01:36.254
some things in place that encouraged 
cross-pollinization between and amongst those

01:22.313 --> 01:36.254
organizations. You know, they've got, oh, I heard 
somebody mention that there are like 20,000

01:37.616 --> 01:45.347
different leadership opportunities or whatever 
it is on campus now. We had, really, during that

01:46.969 --> 01:50.835
time frame, two, three, four, really four sort of 
major leadership opportunities. One was student

02:02.667 --> 02:03.728
government. At the time, it was organized a little 
bit differently from the way it is run now, and I'll

02:05.671 --> 02:11.639
get that in just a second. Secondly was the 
Memorial Student Center that Wayne Stark ran and

02:11.659 --> 02:19.270
provided that opportunity for kids to lead. And 
then there was Corps of Cadets, of course, which

02:20.161 --> 02:24.446
had always been a part of the routine. And then 
there was the Residence Halls Association, which

02:25.347 --> 02:34.278
was an organization basically made up of kids 
living on campus.

02:35.941 --> 02:49.257
Within that MSC hierarchy, there were other 
activities in which students could participate,

02:35.941 --> 02:49.257
whether it was a political forum or SCONA or, you 
know, whatever, the opus, all of the various, very

02:50.198 --> 03:14.026
many positive, worldly kinds of things that I 
think Wayne Stark should be given a great deal of

02:50.198 --> 03:14.026
credit for bringing to our university, and also 
for giving kids an opportunity to participate,

02:50.198 --> 03:14.026
and of course, thanks to the folks who gave money to 
support it, like the Wiley Lecture Series, for

02:50.198 --> 03:14.026
example, but to bring those kinds of things to 
campus. At the time, student government was

03:16.029 --> 03:19.733
organized in a fashion such that The president, 
that each of the officers of, we really sort of had a

03:20.827 --> 03:25.331
mixed bag. It really wasn't a separated 
government in terms of the traditional

03:25.351 --> 03:29.334
government sense. People ran for president, 
people ran for one of the various vice presidents

03:31.496 --> 03:38.502
that were available. One was academic affairs, 
one was finance, one was rules and regs, one was

03:38.522 --> 03:47.190
external affairs, and there was another one, and I 
cannot remember what they said. Oh, student

03:47.210 --> 03:49.652
services.

03:50.797 --> 03:55.363
Each of those people ran independently. But 
ultimately, when those people were elected, they

03:55.383 --> 04:00.989
were automatically members of the Senate. So each 
of those vice presidents served as members of the

04:02.371 --> 04:13.825
legislative voting body, with the exception of 
me, the president, who had a ex officio role but

04:02.371 --> 04:13.825
could not vote. But there was this thing called the 
executive committee. And the executive

04:16.108 --> 04:20.213
committee was made up of these five vice 
presidents. none of whom ran together on a ticket,

04:20.480 --> 04:41.310
and this president, who did not have a vote, and the 
speaker, who was the elected individual from the

04:20.480 --> 04:41.310
Senate body, and the MSC president served as a 
member of the executive committee. What I did when

04:41.530 --> 04:48.360
I became president was I included the court 
commander as a member of the executive committee

04:48.931 --> 04:53.061
and expanded it in that fashion. Now, by the same 
token, I served as a member of the MSC council,

04:53.502 --> 05:01.320
which was the governing body of the, so there was 
sort of like a swap out that occurred, but there was

05:01.520 --> 05:11.415
A lot of, in fact, everybody who, ironically, the 
guy who served as MSC president at that time and

05:01.520 --> 05:11.415
other members of his council, the guy who was core 
commander at that time, were also members of the

05:01.520 --> 05:11.415
Senate, too. So we generally loaded it up, and so 
you were engaged in two or three different

05:11.495 --> 05:21.250
activities, and there was a great... A unifying, 
not a dividing up. That is true. Now we still had

05:26.369 --> 05:30.814
the, we still had the, you know, normal core 
non-reg kind of a deal. Of course, percentage of

05:30.854 --> 05:33.778
the student body was declining. And we still had 
that. In fact, my race for student body president,

05:37.301 --> 05:49.515
I ran against a guy, a guy from the Corps of Cadets, 
and another guy who was a non-reg like myself.

05:50.086 --> 05:51.147
won it on the first ballot. We didn't have to worry 
about a runoff, which was kind of nice. Describe

05:54.371 --> 05:57.214
your campaign. My campaign, the guy who was sort of 
like my campaign chairman was a guy from Kenya who

05:57.234 --> 06:07.186
had previously been vice president of academic 
affairs, and his name was Rajesh Kent. And Raj

06:08.027 --> 06:14.575
served as my campaign chairman, for whatever that 
meant. And at that time, we had a limit on spending

06:14.673 --> 06:21.843
associated with the campaigns of $100. And that 
allowed me just about enough money to print up some

06:23.786 --> 06:28.032
flyers. And there were really sort of only three 
places on campus where you could put, which were

06:29.074 --> 06:38.026
places in which they would allow you to put 
campaign signs. And so by the time I bought the

06:38.868 --> 06:41.271
plywood and the paint, to do my sign over by Kruger 
Dunn, which caught all the guys and gals headed

06:42.145 --> 06:52.476
from the court area kind of toward the Animal 
Science Committee and then down toward the

06:42.145 --> 06:52.476
Engineering Department. One over by Sabisa, 
which was kind of to catch the kids on the north side

06:52.496 --> 06:59.543
of campus, and one right by the MSC. That $100 went 
away real fast. We didn't have websites like the

07:02.366 --> 07:11.376
kids can do now, which I thought was quite 
interesting during one of the most recent student

07:02.366 --> 07:11.376
body president campaigns. And Raj tried 
diligently to get me to go door to door and I did it

07:12.183 --> 07:20.879
one afternoon for about four doors and I said, I'm 
not going to do this. I'm going to do what I can to get

07:21.600 --> 07:25.687
my message out and hopefully this is going to work. 
And that was it. And it did. But a lot of it again. I

07:31.555 --> 07:47.420
sort of lucked out in the sense that I had this 
constituency there that still there were tons of

07:31.555 --> 07:47.420
kids who came from agricultural backgrounds or 
who lived in towns that I'd been in their, you know,

07:31.555 --> 07:47.420
Temple High School, speaking to a high school 
assembly or whatever from my FFA days. And there

07:47.500 --> 07:50.705
were a lot of folks there that I knew or who knew of 
me. And so I kind of got a cadre of individuals

07:52.087 --> 07:59.318
together like, would you please go talk for me at 
this collegiate FFA meeting or would you go talk

07:52.087 --> 07:59.318
for me at this animal sciences, science, 
engineering society meeting and that was the

07:59.686 --> 08:07.437
summit substance of it. It was pretty quick. Do you 
think that all of your student activities had any

08:08.899 --> 08:14.266
effect on your grade point ratio? No, none. I kid 
the kids now because they talk about the reason

08:17.852 --> 08:25.222
it's taking five and a half, six years to get out of 
school. I'm on your side on that one. Because

08:27.850 --> 08:32.998
there's just so many student activities in which 
they can be involved in. And their involvement in

08:33.018 --> 08:36.924
them, they just don't have time. So therefore, 
they take 12 hours a semester. There was not a

08:41.171 --> 08:48.142
single semester during my very short time when we 
started counting up months at Texas A&M. There was

08:48.162 --> 08:52.449
not a single semester where I took less than a full 
load. And I considered a full load at least 16

08:52.469 --> 08:55.714
hours. My last semester as an undergraduate, I 
took 22 hours and got a 4-0. And the same was the case

09:02.043 --> 09:16.137
with my one semester in graduate school, where I 
took 12 hours, which is a full load from a graduate

09:02.043 --> 09:16.137
student perspective. And I managed to balance all 
of that with the seemingly interminable meetings

09:16.157 --> 09:24.165
that arose as a result of my activities as a student 
leader. At the time, too, there were a lot of other

09:28.608 --> 09:30.451
roles. It wasn't just going to a Senate meeting 
every other week, or it wasn't going to an

09:31.012 --> 09:39.906
executive committee meeting every Sunday night, 
but it was also doing the MSC Council stuff. And

09:41.047 --> 09:49.140
various and sundry ones of us, because of the 
leadership roles we had, were student

09:41.047 --> 09:49.140
representatives, voting student 
representatives, in fact. on a number of the

09:49.373 --> 09:51.095
university committees. For example, I served as a 
member of the academic council. Our vice

09:55.641 --> 10:00.627
president from rules and regs served on the rules 
and regs committee for the university. I also

10:01.007 --> 10:02.549
served on the athletic council. So there were a 
number of other activities that were sort of

10:02.609 --> 10:11.481
automatic that came as a result of the leadership 
roles that we occupied. But in the final analysis,

10:11.561 --> 10:16.767
the impact that they had on my grades was kind of 
zero. Let's see. Back to the student routine. What

10:19.462 --> 10:22.446
was your normal dress for class? What did you 
normally wear to class? My normal dress for class

10:24.189 --> 10:35.785
was blue jeans and even a no collared or a sometimes 
collared shirt. I wore boots a lot.

10:40.451 --> 10:42.815
I wore tennis a lot. There were days that my dress 
was different because of the fact that I might have

10:49.280 --> 10:55.086
other activities to do during the day that require 
a coat and tie. For example, some luncheon or some

10:55.106 --> 10:59.771
speech or representing a student body in some 
capacity. But that was more toward my last year on

10:59.791 --> 11:02.434
campus. Otherwise, it was pretty 
student-oriented. Of course, in the summer and a

11:06.378 --> 11:14.967
half that I went to summer school, it was shorts and 
t-shirts kind of a deal. Throughout all this, too,

11:16.280 --> 11:18.663
I was also involved with singing cadets. And so 
there were some times when that required my dress

11:18.683 --> 11:25.852
to be different. Let's do the singing cadets. Bob 
Boone was a conductor. Again, a very, very weird

11:29.957 --> 11:34.122
experience for me. I auditioned for the singing 
cadets in the fall of 1973 when I finally started my

11:34.342 --> 11:44.835
freshman year in earnest and was a bufo, which name 
given to a first-year member of the same cadet,

11:45.203 --> 11:50.588
which is a term that comes from the comic opera. 
And, you know, you had to wear a key, a wooden key,

11:52.330 --> 11:58.716
and you had to go get signatures and, you know, drop 
handles, look out. In fact, this was probably the

11:58.736 --> 12:11.008
closest to the Corps in terms of some of the 
traditions associated with the Corps that I got

11:58.736 --> 12:11.008
was because of my Senate cadet involvement, which 
the Senate cadets had sort of appropriated. And

12:11.427 --> 12:19.858
there were several members, I guess at the time 
probably 15 or 20% of the guys were also in the Corps

12:11.427 --> 12:19.858
of Cadets. And so that sort of worked real well. But 
then I dropped out. And so I missed that

12:24.724 --> 12:27.207
experience. Indeed, I missed going, I think that 
was the summer, I think 74 was the summer that the

12:27.227 --> 12:34.616
Singh Cadets went to Romania. And I missed going to 
Romania because I was off playing at the

12:34.636 --> 12:37.620
Fayetteville. came back and had to be a Bufo again 
in the fall of 1974. And I continued to, as a member

12:43.708 --> 12:49.396
singer, that's the 74, 75 still year. And I guess I 
did 75, 76. And when I was elected student body

12:54.203 --> 12:59.812
president, I dropped out of the room, because that 
was just going to be too much time. But Bob Boone was

12:59.832 --> 13:02.035
the rector. Let's see. There's another piece I 
want to throw into, which may or may not be sort of

13:04.027 --> 13:08.513
relevant to what you're thinking about. When you 
ask me about dress,

13:08.893 --> 13:23.291
when I initially started in the fall of 1973, I 
lived on campus, as I had done that summer session

13:08.893 --> 13:23.291
before when I lived in McInnis.

13:26.095 --> 13:32.683
And then I dropped out for a year, and because of 
sort of the way I sort of got back into school the

13:33.068 --> 13:35.410
fall of 74. I lived off campus with some friends in 
the fall of 74 and moved back on campus to McInnis

13:35.430 --> 13:45.479
again in the spring of 75. I lived there for, I 
guess, another year. So living on campus had a lot

13:48.282 --> 14:00.713
to do with dress as well because if you needed to go 
change during the course of the day, it was easy to

13:48.282 --> 14:00.713
run back over to the north side of campus and take 
that change if you needed to. It became a little bit

14:01.115 --> 14:11.227
more difficult once I moved off campus again, 
which I did, I guess, the fall of 75.

14:11.247 --> 14:18.656
I'm guessing now that in your day, people didn't 
yet have backpacks.

14:18.736 --> 14:19.196
You're right. Now that I think about that, you kind 
of had to carry them under your arm. I don't

14:23.301 --> 14:25.924
remember ever having a backpack. I don't know what 
we did when it rained, because it always used to

14:26.849 --> 14:39.875
rain on Tuesdays and Thursdays at about 1.45 in the 
afternoon when I had to walk from the engineering

14:26.849 --> 14:39.875
building to the academic building. I remember 
those days pretty clearly. I don't know what we

14:42.982 --> 14:43.843
did. And y'all didn't wear shaggy, deliberately 
worn-out jeans yet. No, but you'd wear some faded

14:48.938 --> 14:54.404
ones because it was just tons of washing, but it 
would be sort of equally faded. But it was not with

14:54.565 --> 14:58.349
big holes in the knees. No, no. And no sandals yet. 
No sandals. Well, but not a whole lot. And most

15:05.257 --> 15:08.181
people still had a haircut and still shaved. Now, 
wait a minute. No, no, no, no, wait a minute. That's

15:11.384 --> 15:12.866
how one wants to describe that. I had an afro during 
that time frame, which was sort of like the

15:14.208 --> 15:17.832
going... In fact, there is a picture, which I'm 
most ashamed of, of the student leaders that we

15:18.233 --> 15:25.764
took. I guess this was when I was, was it when I was a 
speaker or when I was president, I can't remember.

15:31.292 --> 15:40.686
And we took it, the fountain was off, of course, but 
in the fountain between the Board of Regents annex

15:31.292 --> 15:40.686
and the main part of the MSC, there on the south end. 
In fact, every time I walk by there and I think about

15:40.706 --> 15:46.435
that gross picture,

15:46.668 --> 15:49.560
that are varying heights that water normally 
cascades over. We were kind of standing and

15:49.580 --> 15:50.825
sitting there. And I've got this huge afro. I'm 
wearing it. polyester leisure suit jacket. Now

15:56.010 --> 15:57.531
this would have been when you were... It was like 
75. You're not yet president of the student body.

16:01.775 --> 16:02.996
No, it's a student leader picture. And I can't 
remember whether it was when I was speaker and it's

16:03.336 --> 16:10.442
in the 75 Aggieland or whether or not it's in the 76. 
Doesn't really make a difference. Guys have long

16:13.285 --> 16:14.346
hair. Some of the other student leaders have. Some 
of the other student leader guys have long hair.

16:19.310 --> 16:20.070
I've got long hair. We're not polyester finest. 
And I

16:24.434 --> 16:35.045
would have had, when I came to, well, I would have 
had a mustache, but for the fact that I was in St.

16:24.434 --> 16:35.045
Cadets. And facial hair was not permitted in St. 
Cadets. But

16:39.509 --> 16:45.075
I'm pretty, well, I'm not sure. I have to go back and 
look. But I'm pretty sure that I would be willing to

16:46.496 --> 16:53.563
bet you that when I got out of St. Cadets, I would 
have had a mustache go back, which I've had since

16:46.496 --> 16:53.563
then. One of the questions I've enjoyed asking, 
please recall some of the jokes, pranks, and other

16:54.370 --> 17:04.668
good bull that you may have known about during your 
years at A&M. If you start down that path,

17:04.708 --> 17:12.342
oh, let me see. There were so many, it's kind of hard 
to... Well, share some of them. I'll share one of

17:17.531 --> 17:18.312
them. There was a... I know of a guy who used to live 
in McInnis who was a pre-med student. He's now a

17:28.696 --> 17:30.899
physician. And for some reason he managed to get 
back to his room with various pieces of equipment

17:30.919 --> 17:48.002
from the chemistry labs that he was involved in, 
primarily plastic tubing, which somehow created

17:30.919 --> 17:48.002
a nice set of materials that aided in the creation 
of a catapult type mechanism which could be used

17:49.265 --> 18:16.960
against aggressively against individuals who 
happen to park in the lot outside of Schumacher

17:49.265 --> 18:16.960
particularly when various fruits and vegetables 
were retrieved from Savisa during mealtimes that

18:17.497 --> 18:37.787
were stored

18:17.497 --> 18:37.787
behind the tiles in the ceiling in the event that a 
certain residence hall person came by to look for

18:17.497 --> 18:37.787
any culprits associated with those activities 
flying off the fourth stoop of McKinnis. That's

18:38.548 --> 18:41.873
one that always sticks out pretty much. I'll have 
to think about some others. You know, I, or like the

18:46.893 --> 19:08.580
night that a bunch of things that we were sort of 
forced by a member of the Board of Regents to go sing

18:46.893 --> 19:08.580
during the middle of the week, sing cadets, to go 
sing in Wortham, Texas. And none of us wanted to do

19:08.800 --> 19:11.003
it, not a single one of us. And we were kind of angry 
because some board member had beveled enough to

19:11.023 --> 19:15.448
force us to do that. which, by the way, has a great 
deal to do with my attitude. I was able to live with

19:18.844 --> 19:20.445
four regions now. And I remember returning home. I 
lived in an apartment during that time frame, so I

19:25.510 --> 19:29.434
was in the back of an apartment complex. I remember 
returning home and seeing police cars about 12.30

19:29.454 --> 19:36.440
at night at my apartment. There had been an 
altercation between a roommate of mine and a young

19:36.801 --> 19:44.828
lady, and Uh, when the police came by to talk to my 
roommate, uh, they walked into our apartment and

19:45.770 --> 20:04.090
noticed that it was decorated in early road sign 
and contained items that had once existed in the

19:45.770 --> 20:04.090
commons area.

20:04.110 --> 20:08.414
Which various of my roommates had collected over 
the years. Uh, they didn't have too much problem

20:09.435 --> 20:15.642
with the ones that, you know, Gawock Creek or, or 
Brazos River, it was the stops and the yield signs

20:15.925 --> 20:26.401
in the one way that didn't sit too kindly with the 
college station police.

20:28.624 --> 20:34.033
Another one of those points, fortunately, that a 
better judgment prevailed. Alright, do you

20:34.253 --> 20:36.496
remember any played on you? No, I actually avoided 
them. I avoided them pretty well. I was nice to

20:42.569 --> 20:44.651
everybody, so nobody ever played me. I kept 
getting threatened by my buddies in the court if

20:44.731 --> 20:50.776
they were going to quad me, just for a good bowl. So 
the student body president didn't get it? This is

20:52.738 --> 20:54.119
when I was student body president, yeah. They kept 
threatening that they were going to quad me, and

20:54.579 --> 21:03.907
what I did to overcome that was, and this is really 
sort of, I think, another one of the reasons that I

20:54.579 --> 21:03.907
was elected student body president. During the 
time that I was a junior, or whatever is equivalent

21:05.028 --> 21:10.333
to my junior year, I guess, when I was Speaker. And I 
continued this actually throughout my time as a

21:12.329 --> 21:15.453
senior. A number of the guys on CORE's staff were 
good friends of mine, or had become good friends of

21:15.473 --> 21:21.159
mine. And, you know, so like, I guess Dunkin' 
wasn't open, Sabisa wasn't open on Sunday night,

21:21.599 --> 21:31.911
CORE used to go, or you had to go find someplace else 
to eat if you didn't live in an apartment or

21:21.599 --> 21:31.911
something. There weren't just a whole hell of a lot 
of restaurants to choose one from. In fact, one of

21:35.756 --> 21:37.958
our favorites, because I'd just go join up the 
Corps guys on Sunday night and we'd go in or

21:38.663 --> 21:44.711
something, or a number of them. And one of our 
favorites was the Rockies, which at that time was

21:45.472 --> 21:59.051
located down this dirt road in the middle of the 
woods, which I think is now about the location of

21:45.472 --> 21:59.051
the Albertsons, or thereabouts. And I mean, there 
just weren't a whole lot of choices of places to go,

22:00.333 --> 22:08.164
but we did that sort of regularly. What was the name 
of it? Jose? Did he operate? I can't remember who

22:12.781 --> 22:13.942
operated. I can't remember the name. But that was 
sort of like a Sunday night ritual. And so they

22:17.867 --> 22:22.532
really never did me in, which I looked at. If you and 
your buddies were going to go partying. Partying?

22:27.418 --> 22:28.860
Yeah. On a Saturday night? No, Thursday night was a 
big one. Oh, Thursday night? Where? It was

22:33.205 --> 22:34.827
Thursday and Saturday. Back then and now, and I 
guess really this is something which I've learned

22:35.161 --> 22:46.113
since, it's really sort of a big night for 
partying, if you will, on college campuses all

22:35.161 --> 22:46.113
throughout the country. But Thursday night was a 
big night for Lakey, for guys who wanted to go

22:46.133 --> 22:52.580
country and western dances. I never sat, 
ironically, as much of a country and western fan as

22:52.640 --> 22:59.447
I am, and much of an agricultural background. I 
have never to this day sat for Lakey. But a lot of my

23:02.951 --> 23:05.033
buddies did it a very long time ago. The other place 
was at the western, you know, eastern entrance to

23:06.177 --> 23:16.929
campus, the Magnum trips. God, I can't believe I 
can't remember the name of this place. It's set on

23:19.172 --> 23:20.293
the right hand side. Eastgate? Yeah, on Eastgate. 
Right as you come out from the system

23:22.696 --> 23:25.539
administration building. I'll try to remember 
the name of it. But that was the big hangout. A lot of

23:28.722 --> 23:30.244
Corps guys hung out there. Um, there was a thing 
open for a while called the Sports Club, which is

23:30.865 --> 23:45.260
sort of where the athletes hung out, which is at 
Northgate, uh, sort of near the International

23:30.865 --> 23:45.260
House of Painters, and it was the last thing in that 
little shopping center there. And then during the

23:45.280 --> 23:58.493
time that I was in school, 1974, um, the Dixie 
Chicken opened, which is great for those of us who

23:45.280 --> 23:58.493
lived on the north side of campus because you sort 
of walk across the street and do your deal and

23:45.280 --> 23:58.493
stumble back. There was another thing going on in 
campus during this time too. When I started school

24:01.736 --> 24:12.934
in July of 73, it was the first year that 
18-year-olds were allowed to join the

24:01.736 --> 24:12.934
constitutional amendment that had passed. And so 
that sort of changed the nature of it too because of

24:12.994 --> 24:22.489
the ability to go to various places around town 
because of the change of the 18 year old. It was no

24:25.841 --> 24:27.583
longer a forbidden. It was no longer a forbidden 
place, and that's probably one of the reasons that

24:27.603 --> 24:35.714
Don opened the chicken right there across from 
campus, as did some other things that opened later

24:27.603 --> 24:35.714
on. I do not think as well, let me add to this,

24:36.235 --> 24:44.646
I do not remember yet Being a time frame, however, 
where I would say that kids drank to excess, I think

24:45.503 --> 24:57.014
it was fairly responsible. And if they were 
drinking, what beverages were they drinking?

24:59.756 --> 25:00.197
Beer. It was basically beer. And you could get 
mixed drinks over at the sports club. And then

25:06.843 --> 25:13.789
there was a joint on Welbert Highway, the name of 
which I cannot remember, but that was sort of where

25:14.377 --> 25:16.439
kind of rock kids hung out. I mean, people kind of 
went to their places. Uncle Ed's Hard Liquors was

25:20.383 --> 25:22.585
gone, wasn't it? Uncle Ed's wasn't there. No, that 
was not there. What about Whiskey Bridge? Whiskey

25:26.368 --> 25:27.909
Bridge wasn't there. That building has now been 
leveled, by the way. Yeah, no, that wasn't there.

25:32.414 --> 25:38.299
God, I can't believe I can't remember the name of 
the place outside the system building. I will

25:38.319 --> 25:41.582
remember, because I had a very, very, very public 
incident there when I was student body president

25:42.929 --> 25:50.619
that will forever stick in my

25:42.929 --> 25:50.619
memory. That was, I chalk it up to being the only 
negative known racial incident known to me. Oh.

26:01.053 --> 26:08.564
Racial incident that I was ever exposed to during 
my time in college. Would you share that? I will,

26:09.765 --> 26:12.649
and I wish I could think of the name of the place, 
which is That's what's amazing. I can't remember.

26:14.793 --> 26:17.116
It was a pizza place. Oh,

26:17.136 --> 26:22.602
gosh. It has more poignancy if I can remember the 
name of it. I can't remember the name of it. Anyway,

26:27.608 --> 26:29.551
it was the year that I was student vice president. 
It was after the Rice A&M football game. And I think

26:36.619 --> 26:39.102
we won. I believe so. And I had gone in and was 
meeting some student government and other corps

26:42.650 --> 26:47.136
buddies. There was a big corps hanging out there. 
Those guys hung out a lot there. And I was sitting

26:52.783 --> 27:09.365
back in the back of the bar with some friends and 
this person who was a friend or an acquaintance of

26:52.783 --> 27:09.365
mine. Put him in the acquaintance category from 
that day forward. who was also a student leader on

27:13.058 --> 27:16.443
campus. And I won't go any further than that 
because it is probably, it only takes one more

27:16.463 --> 27:26.938
identifier and we'll know who that person is. 
Ironically in the room too, this is really kind of a

27:28.199 --> 27:40.737
strange story, but ironically in the bar as well 
was a friend of mine, in fact probably the first

27:28.199 --> 27:40.737
person that I met on campus. When I came there, his 
son was 73. He also knew this individual very well.

27:51.894 --> 27:55.637
And the individual walks in the door. It's not 
called

27:55.657 --> 28:09.069
Charlie's,

27:55.657 --> 28:09.069
but what was the name of the place? I'm going to ask. 
God, I can't believe I can't remember. We'll think

28:10.610 --> 28:11.311
of it. We'll think of it. He walks in the door, 
swings over the door, spies me in the back of the

28:12.796 --> 28:16.180
room. In fact, I probably wasn't the only black 
person in the room. And he yells at the very top of

28:18.983 --> 28:26.111
his lungs, above the den of the crowd, oh my God, 
look at the nigger, he's here. And he just sort of

28:28.213 --> 28:32.098
kept saying that. And he obviously had been 
drinking in excess. And I, which he sort of had a

28:38.345 --> 28:42.229
problem with, And I was trying to figure out how to 
respond to it, if at all. And ironically, this guy

28:51.887 --> 29:12.148
who was one of the first persons, people that I met 
on campus, whom I heard on many other occasions,

28:51.887 --> 29:12.148
utter racial epithets about people who were other 
than black people, who just hears this person say

28:51.887 --> 29:12.148
this, and heads toward the door where this 
individual came in, grabbed him by his shirt

29:12.787 --> 29:24.680
collar, slammed him up against the wall, and 
basically said, told him, shut up. And if he ever

29:24.820 --> 29:31.307
said that again, particularly in an environment 
like that, he's going to beat the crap out of him.

29:31.327 --> 29:35.831
And this friend was big enough to do that, and angry 
enough to do that. And fortunately, I didn't have

29:35.851 --> 29:37.293
to do anything. And I probably knew 90% of the 
people in the bar very well, first names. You know,

29:42.352 --> 30:01.512
I could see the next day if I had responded in some 
different fashion than both the Brian Eagle and

29:42.352 --> 30:01.512
the battalion that had a wonderful story about the 
student vice president getting into a fight at

29:42.352 --> 30:01.512
this bar, the name of which I cannot remember what 
it is right now. That was really the only incident

30:01.532 --> 30:11.582
that I was aware of that I ever dealt with any sort of 
racial problem during my time there. My

30:12.052 --> 30:21.342
suspicion, too, is that during that time, there 
might have been 100, maybe 150 black kids on campus

30:12.052 --> 30:21.342
out of 28,000. 80% of them were athletes. The rest 
of us came there because of either parents in the

30:26.728 --> 30:40.624
military and they decided they wanted to be in the 
Corps and they, too, wanted to be in the military,

30:26.728 --> 30:40.624
or there were people who came from the immediate 
geographical area like Snook or Bryan or Caldwell

30:41.195 --> 30:49.646
or that sort of, or Hempstead. Or others of us who 
came there for special educational programs like

30:49.666 --> 30:59.178
engineering or political culture. Was there a 
special person that minority students turned to

30:59.198 --> 31:04.204
for advice and counsel? There was no, there was no, 
there was nobody who served in that capacity. Did

31:11.722 --> 31:12.763
Did they need to be?

31:15.867 --> 31:21.855
Did all these minority students get good 
advising?

31:23.397 --> 31:27.243
I think as a practical matter, yeah, we all got 
great advising. And I think that goes back more,

31:27.883 --> 31:38.978
Haskell, to the question of that thing that I 
talked about earlier in terms of the

31:27.883 --> 31:38.978
relationships between students.
