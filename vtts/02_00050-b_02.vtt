Rutter's office before the Baylor game after 
their business is okay Admiral let's get down to

00:03.625 --> 00:31.573
the real nitty-gritty he said what are you big old 
mean bear is gonna do to our poor laggies on

00:03.625 --> 00:31.573
Saturday and he paused as he listened and then he 
nearly fell out of his chair laughing mr. McCall

00:03.625 --> 00:31.573
had said Earl we gonna beat the hell out of you but 
we're gonna do it in a Christian like way

00:33.815 --> 00:39.764
And then, just to top that one off, his 
relationship with Abner was so good. Oh, I loved to

00:40.565 --> 00:41.867
see them together. We got the official Baylor 
University Christmas card one year, and it was

00:42.908 --> 00:47.996
posed. It was Abner McCall and his wife and one or 
two children, I don't remember, together by

00:48.596 --> 01:02.877
themselves, nobody else around, in the bleachers 
of Baylor Stadium, and a picture made of them And

01:03.211 --> 01:07.457
they're all looking down towards the same 
direction of the goal post. And on the outside of

01:07.477 --> 01:16.609
the Christmas card, it said, Here you see the Abner 
McCall family at Baylor Stadium waiting for Santa

01:07.477 --> 01:16.609
Claus. You open it up, and it says, He hasn't been 
here in a long, long time.

01:25.301 --> 01:28.104
So those are my favorite stories. Oh, that's very 
good.
