WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:02.693
We'll take two. I don't really think the coffee 
would be better. It makes me more nervous, and you

00:05.796 --> 00:08.539
might tranquilize me.

00:16.889 --> 00:23.316
What sort of support did you receive, let's say, 
from your superiors when you began to consider the

00:16.889 --> 00:23.316
idea of consolidation? In the early 60s, nobody 
saw any necessity for consolidation. because

00:29.073 --> 00:32.197
they wouldn't see any necessity necessarily for 
oceanography. We received complete support

00:33.398 --> 00:41.187
from, I'd say, the Secretariat of the Navy as 
opposed to the military side of the Navy. And I

00:41.207 --> 00:49.156
think the reason for that is the military side was 
not that personally involved in the scientific

00:41.207 --> 00:49.156
side of oceanography. And don't forget, we were 
just breaking into engineering in the early 60s.

00:53.401 --> 00:56.565
Engineering really didn't even come of age until 
after the Thresher.

01:00.950 --> 01:05.194
I think that's a relatively fair and accurate 
statement. The Thresher forced engineering to

01:05.214 --> 01:07.316
come of age. We had things before that, but it began 
to force the recognition of it. As far as man in the

01:12.341 --> 01:21.509
sea is concerned, the Navy

01:12.341 --> 01:21.509
had led the world in diving, and yet the Navy got way 
behind it. I mean, the people argue today that the

01:21.569 --> 01:26.294
Navy diver goes to 190 feet and the oil diver goes to 
1,000 feet. Well, the Navy did the science to get

01:26.314 --> 01:29.877
you to 1,000 feet, but the Navy won't operate it. 
It's divers at 1,000 feet. Because the Navy is a

01:31.965 --> 01:33.887
very conservative organization. Its 
regulations are written in blood. This leads you

01:36.869 --> 01:40.613
to believe that you have to be careful how you 
regulate things. And I remember when they kept

01:40.693 --> 01:46.339
saying to the Navy, you take over the 
responsibility for certifying submersibles. My

01:46.399 --> 01:56.108
answer to that was, all right, but always put that 
clause in there that allows you to exempt things

01:46.399 --> 01:56.108
for science and for research and for development. 
Because if you insist upon the kinds of criteria

01:56.148 --> 01:59.391
that bureaucracy will put on you, you'll never get 
from here to there because you'll always design

01:59.776 --> 02:10.090
something that's fail-safe, and you'll always 
design something based on what you had yesterday

01:59.776 --> 02:10.090
and not what you hope to get tomorrow. So we always 
put that clause in the kinds of things we were doing

02:11.231 --> 02:16.999
and then ran it from the Secretary's office. I 
think in today's world, the bigger bureaucrats,

02:17.019 --> 02:24.889
the head of the Office of Management and Budget and 
down a couple echelons, the White House, And I

02:25.443 --> 02:30.950
speak of the White House in an amorphic sense and 
not whether it's a Republican or Democrat. The

02:32.112 --> 02:43.547
Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of 
Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, and even the

02:32.112 --> 02:43.547
Chief of Naval Operations recognize that 
consolidation is a way, they look at it as a way of

02:32.112 --> 02:43.547
saving money and manpower. I look at it as that's 
true, but I don't want to save anything. I want to

02:46.832 --> 02:54.302
just get more so that I can do the job that I think we 
all have to do because we all know we don't have

02:46.832 --> 02:54.302
enough manpower resources or dollar resources. 
And today I've had a lot of support from everybody

02:55.143 --> 03:07.836
in the bureaucratic system throughout 
government for consolidation for one reason or

02:55.143 --> 03:07.836
another, mostly because of the reason of saving 
money in billets. And very little cooperation

03:07.856 --> 03:19.427
from most of the academic community and most of the 
scientific community because they see it as a

03:07.856 --> 03:19.427
threat to their existence or to their way of doing 
business. And they have a rational fear because

03:23.847 --> 03:33.239
large organizations tend to justify their 
existence on what they do internally as opposed to

03:23.847 --> 03:33.239
what someone else does for them externally. And so 
we have tried to be very careful in the

03:34.480 --> 03:48.237
consolidation to ensure that the academic part of 
oceanography has a fence built around it so you

03:34.480 --> 03:48.237
can't use those dollars to build up somebody's 
empire internally. I think that's a very valid

03:49.118 --> 03:52.082
fear. That fear stated to me by the people I 
respect, like Tex and

03:52.484 --> 04:03.116
Calhoun and those people there. I certainly, 
they've talked to me privately. Art Maxwell,

04:06.339 --> 04:12.165
Nuremberg, Paul Fye, Walter Monk. I can name you 
hundreds of people that have talked on that

04:12.185 --> 04:15.349
problem. And I have had, they have been 
intelligent about it and focused on what the real

04:15.389 --> 04:20.154
problem is. Many times, People criticize you, and 
you spend an awful lot of time finding out what

04:21.408 --> 04:29.359
really is their concern, what is their problem as 
they see it. Because it doesn't really matter if

04:30.200 --> 04:39.953
it's a real mathematical problem, because when 
you're dealing with people, a problem perceived

04:30.200 --> 04:39.953
is in fact a real problem, even though it's not a 
mathematical problem. It's been difficult to

04:40.554 --> 04:45.100
sort out what people's real objection is. There 
are very valid objections in the academic world. I

04:48.485 --> 04:50.267
think we have pretty much put the system in gear to 
ensure that the safety checks and balances are

04:50.652 --> 04:55.598
there. In the other part of the world, that is the 
in-house internal Navy world, they're very

04:56.579 --> 05:05.349
concerned that you don't take away from them what 
they have. I say they say what they need to do their

05:05.470 --> 05:08.333
job. I would never take away from a man what he needs 
to do his job, but I would take away from a man what he

05:08.533 --> 05:20.187
thinks he needs to do his job when I think that the 
major job is yet to be done and can be done better in

05:08.533 --> 05:20.187
another group. And I think there's another 
problem in today's world which wasn't

05:20.892 --> 05:34.684
necessarily here in the 60s, and that is that 
you're not going to get large amounts of money in

05:20.892 --> 05:34.684
either the scientific world or the Department of 
Defense world or the Department of the Navy world

05:20.892 --> 05:34.684
to build bricks and mortar. We had that capability 
in the early 60s, both academically and

05:35.705 --> 05:40.929
militarily. I think that that disappeared 
sometime during Vietnam. And so as to the physical

05:44.892 --> 05:50.477
choice of where you do it, you get locked in cement 
in a hurry. The reason they chose Mississippi was

05:50.947 --> 05:53.750
not the way the newspaper said. There was no 
political pressure. Senator Stennis didn't even

05:55.071 --> 05:58.154
know we'd chosen it until we told him. It was a real 
simple thing. About $200 million worth of bricks

05:59.175 --> 06:03.520
and mortar and not being used. That's a phase out of 
the NASA project, right? Yeah, it was built up for

06:06.923 --> 06:08.745
Apollo. It wasn't started until 62. By the time it 
was partially finished, Apollo funding was down

06:10.267 --> 06:14.251
to zero. Not completely, but It certainly didn't 
need a six-mile radius base of operations with a

06:16.613 --> 06:30.632
canal that connected it to the Gulf and a model base 
and a test and 48,000 feet of biology laboratory

06:16.613 --> 06:30.632
and 20,000 feet of computer space and all that kind 
of thing. And I think that we gained from that. And I

06:32.655 --> 06:36.580
think the taxpayer eventually gained because it 
means that the money they spent won't be wasted.

06:36.620 --> 06:37.662
That's a way of saying it. Of course, you can argue 
that. It would be better sometimes to waste the

06:39.192 --> 06:43.600
taxpayers' money and stop something than to 
perpetuate it. But is it not true that the

06:43.620 --> 06:48.289
equipment for NASA, for example, is easily 
converted to equipment for oceanography? That

06:48.309 --> 06:54.581
place is probably 85% designed as you would design 
it as an oceanographer, frankly. And that's an

06:55.924 --> 07:00.913
answer in saying yes to your question in more 
specific terms. Have you found it easier, I take it

07:01.180 --> 07:06.307
now, to consolidate in 1976 than you did in 1963? 
Yes, and there was one other thing that happened in

07:06.888 --> 07:15.861
1975 that wasn't here in 63, and it began to happen 
right after the Vietnamese War. The drive, and

07:16.803 --> 07:22.831
perhaps you'll again say that it's because of my 
parochialism, but let me put it this way. The drive

07:22.891 --> 07:29.601
towards socialism in this country tends to 
dictate an increase in the bureaucracy in Vietnam

07:29.969 --> 07:32.552
areas like health, education, and welfare. So you 
know how partial I am, I'll say, in the giveaway

07:34.954 --> 07:39.879
programs. By that, the whole country pretends 
they don't want to be socialistic, but they vote

07:39.900 --> 07:46.827
for programs which help themselves. But they 
won't vote for just continually increasing the

07:48.308 --> 07:51.932
bureaucracy in Washington. So this puts a 
pressure on the bureaucracy in Washington if they

07:51.992 --> 07:58.339
don't absolutely have to be here to get their A out 
of town. So about 1970 or 71, a major drive was

07:58.977 --> 08:12.434
reinstated by certain members of Congress to get 
the Department of Defense and specifically the

07:58.977 --> 08:12.434
Navy out of the National Capital Region. And this 
worked to the advantage of consolidation because

08:12.454 --> 08:23.287
if somebody is forcing you to get out, as you're 
leaving, you hopefully will head for one location

08:12.454 --> 08:23.287
instead of for 15. And I think that was really the 
final straw that that pushed us over the hump.

08:31.382 --> 08:35.988
Sounds like an 18th century British idea of 
sending the armies out to the colonies so they

08:31.382 --> 08:35.988
can't be seen. Probably true. Probably true. I 
think that's partially it, but from a

08:38.852 --> 08:47.364
congressional viewpoint, it's also so they can 
have more room to put in more of their own kind of

08:38.852 --> 08:47.364
troops. In fact, it's fascinating. Mr. Nixon, 
regardless of what you think of him, swore he'd

08:50.528 --> 08:55.756
decrease the bureaucracy in Washington. He put 
out figures that said he'd decrease them by 1,000.

08:58.613 --> 09:03.118
Mike Causey, who writes for The Washington Post, I 
think his figure was 11,000 increase. And I trust

09:03.139 --> 09:06.082
Mike's figures more than I would the president's. 
That's about what we increase to the year, about

09:06.102 --> 09:08.665
10,000, 11,000. All you do is walk around this town 
or fly over it, and you can see it's increasing.

09:13.411 --> 09:14.753
It's Parkinson's third law. It's just not the 
exception that proves the rule. It's just

09:18.197 --> 09:20.420
Parkinson moving forward. It's going to be that 
way forever. I want to ask, the next question I want

09:24.466 --> 09:29.351
to ask you is one that you may choose not to answer. 
And that is that between 63 and 75, 76, now you've

09:29.992 --> 09:39.983
been intimately associated with the development 
of oceanography now for 13 years and almost in a

09:29.992 --> 09:39.983
continuum. Have you noticed any change in 
administrations? Any congressmen who are

09:42.886 --> 09:45.188
particularly sympathetic towards you? Any ones 
who are particularly opposed to you? I can answer

09:48.632 --> 09:50.414
that question in my own view. I think that The 
congressmen who supported oceanography in the

09:53.052 --> 09:59.241
mid-60s maintained their support throughout 
their tenure in office. I think the man we lost that

09:59.982 --> 10:12.661
was doing the most to bring things into focus was 
Alton Lennon of one of the Carolinas who headed the

09:59.982 --> 10:12.661
subcommittee on oceanography and who very 
fortunately was also on the Armed Services

09:59.982 --> 10:12.661
Committee so he could sucker the Navy into doing a 
lot. He retired, and then there was a sort of a lack

10:13.963 --> 10:17.768
of leadership. Mrs. Sullivan had the full 
committee, and she was leading, but she wasn't

10:22.583 --> 10:24.845
able to devote as much time on just oceanography. 
She was worrying about merchant marine and

10:24.905 --> 10:32.433
fishing and that sort of thing, but she wasn't able 
to put the time that Mr. Lennon put on oceanography

10:24.905 --> 10:32.433
in general. And then we had the outer continental 
shelf problem that sort of masked what we were

10:33.174 --> 10:39.861
doing in oceanography and the law of the sea, which 
masked what we were doing. And then on the House

10:39.881 --> 10:42.724
side, now we have a new leader there. He's a very 
young man, Mr. Breaux from Louisiana, who I think

10:42.744 --> 10:51.493
is going to put the same drive back into the 
committee that Mr. Lennon had, or maybe more,

10:42.744 --> 10:51.493
because he's younger. On the Senate side, we had 
Senator Magnuson, who I guess was the leader. And

10:57.000 --> 11:00.144
he has certainly never given up a minute on his 
drive. And he was joined recently, within the

11:01.666 --> 11:08.236
last, say, decade, by Senator Hollins, who has 
made a major effort in this area. And there's many

11:08.276 --> 11:11.080
other senators and congressmen who have. I don't 
think anybody has fought against it. But I would

11:15.146 --> 11:20.333
say that oceanography has not increased for maybe 
two or three reasons. is because of the apathy of

11:20.785 --> 11:25.371
the American public and therefore the members of 
Congress. I remember Mr. Alexander from Arkansas

11:26.412 --> 11:36.965
coming over to me and saying, well, you know, they 
got cartoons of me sitting with a bunch of

11:26.412 --> 11:36.965
bikini-clad blondes and the beasts saying this is 
why I'm going scuba diving. Well, the fact of the

11:37.086 --> 11:45.176
matter was he was up in very cold weather off of 
Massachusetts where there weren't any women

11:37.086 --> 11:45.176
around in the middle of the winter and the most 
horrible place in the world to go for diving. But

11:45.957 --> 11:49.341
his opponents were trying to make it look like he 
was on a boondock. There's another problem, I

11:50.418 --> 11:55.245
think, in oceanography, and that is nobody can 
really say what it is we want it for. I can say what I

11:56.427 --> 11:58.049
want it for in the Navy. Some of the oil companies 
can say what they want it for. Some of the fishing

12:02.977 --> 12:16.076
people and some of the shipping people and some of 
the mining people argue about it, but they aren't

12:02.977 --> 12:16.076
as concrete about it as one would hope. Then you 
have the dilemma of how much do you want the federal

12:16.216 --> 12:20.222
government involved in in a subject. Do you want it 
to regulate it? Do you want it to control it? Do you

12:23.569 --> 12:24.330
want it to do it? See, I hold we don't want the 
federal government to do it. We want to keep the

12:28.696 --> 12:41.513
federal government involvement from a 
bureaucratic viewpoint as low as possible, and

12:28.696 --> 12:41.513
yet we want to use the federal government's 
dollars to do those things which cannot be done on

12:28.696 --> 12:41.513
the outside for one reason or another. And 
oceanography, a lot of that fits in that category.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.943
On the other hand, we have developed, certainly 
within the federal government, a significant

12:49.632 --> 12:51.374
amount of technology. We are spending probably 
almost $100 million a year in academic

12:52.676 --> 12:57.944
oceanography today. I think we should spend twice 
as much, but I'm not so sure the rest of the country

12:59.566 --> 13:05.294
would agree to that. We're getting more than our 
fair share of the pie academically, in a sense.

13:10.982 --> 13:11.723
It's spread further. The rice bowl that started 
out with a dozen places And you and I, knowing

13:17.476 --> 13:21.581
everybody that was in the dozen places, has now 
spread to several hundreds. And the inflation

13:21.621 --> 13:34.936
being what it is, $100 million is only equal to 
about $50 million in 1962 in oceanography because

13:21.621 --> 13:34.936
of the high cost of ship operations and all this 
computer work and the salaries too. So it's hard to

13:36.077 --> 13:37.139
say.

13:42.205 --> 13:45.188
But I think that Mr. Eisenhower, supported it not 
because he understood it, but because Mr. Wakeman

13:45.404 --> 13:51.073
came to him and said, Mr. President, here's what 
I'd like to do. And Mr. President says, fine, Jim,

13:51.093 --> 13:53.137
do it. But he never got any personal support from 
the White House beyond that. Then the next

13:58.866 --> 14:00.989
president of the United States was Kennedy. The 
way we got Kennedy interested in it was a lot of

14:01.991 --> 14:05.196
people aren't aware of this. We made a movie. It was 
called Science for Survival. It was a catchy

14:10.465 --> 14:11.426
title. It was done by the Navy. But it wasn't done 
for the Navy. It was done for oceanography. And it

14:16.645 --> 14:18.708
showed the interagency committee functioning. 
And we got Mr. Kennedy to agree to do the opening and

14:18.748 --> 14:22.873
closing to it. And when we wrote the script for the 
president, he threw it down and talked in his own

14:22.893 --> 14:26.537
language. And then the day that he was 
assassinated, I was sitting in the White House

14:27.418 --> 14:39.353
theater room or wherever it was we were screening 
the motion picture and had just gotten tentative

14:27.418 --> 14:39.353
approval from the White House to release the 
picture. And Mr. Johnson made a... arbitrary

14:43.488 --> 15:06.795
moratorium on mr. Kennedy's works for 90 days and I 
forget whether it was in honor of his death but that

14:43.488 --> 15:06.795
picture got caught in the moratorium then I had to 
go back and and say the ex-president you know and

14:43.488 --> 15:06.795
change the soundtrack has never got released then 
it finally got released mr. Johnson really

14:43.488 --> 15:06.795
involved himself in My feeling was the following, 
and I'm sure that Senator Humphrey will tell you

15:08.007 --> 15:13.833
differently, and I'm sure Ed Wink will tell you 
differently. My feeling was Mr. Johnson, being a

15:13.873 --> 15:23.743
Texan and being the man he was, felt very simply, 
hell, if you want to do anything in the ocean, tell

15:13.873 --> 15:23.743
the Navy to do it. You know, he looks at life in a 
simplistic fashion. I think the reason that he set

15:27.347 --> 15:34.875
up the President's Science Advisors Study, the 
PSAC study on oceanography, and I believe the

15:27.347 --> 15:34.875
title was Effective Use of the Sea, was in response 
to congressional pressure. It certainly wasn't

15:38.380 --> 15:40.402
on his own initiative. I think it was in response to 
pressure put on by Magnuson and Lenin, they being

15:40.442 --> 15:46.209
the two leaders at the time. You know, damn it, Mr. 
President, if you don't do something, we will. No

15:49.412 --> 15:54.018
president wants to be told by Congress that they, 
Congress, are going to take the initiative. And

15:54.818 --> 15:56.741
the simple way out of anything is to do a study. So 
they did a study. But, you know, we'd already done a

15:59.043 --> 16:03.208
NASCO study and a Navy study, and then we did a PSAC 
study. Interesting enough, in that time frame,

16:05.517 --> 16:10.883
there were two things that allowed it to grow that 
do not exist today. One, the Navy wanted everybody

16:11.183 --> 16:17.610
else in it and was willing to help fund it in a 
certain sense. It's still willing, but it doesn't

16:17.630 --> 16:21.915
have the money now.

16:23.016 --> 16:27.521
Two, there was so much to be done, there wasn't any 
competition among agencies in reality. Three,

16:34.340 --> 16:38.165
Nobody really realized what it was going to cost 
them, because they were talking science. I guess

16:40.568 --> 16:45.755
there's probably a lot of other reasons, but those 
are probably the primary reasons. I have heard

16:45.775 --> 16:56.329
people say in ONR that, as a matter of fact, the Navy 
went out deliberately to create oceanographic

16:45.775 --> 16:56.329
departments to handle, in effect, specific 
problems. Well, more than that, we even, I

16:56.349 --> 16:59.233
remember one time, illegally, operating the 
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries boats because

17:00.310 --> 17:04.977
they ran out of money and I needed to have something 
done. And I think Tex was the guy that was in charge

17:04.997 --> 17:17.417
of the program to go ahead and get the Bureau of 
Commercial Fisheries fishing fleet, the

17:04.997 --> 17:17.417
government fishing fleet that belonged to the 
Bureau, out doing something for the Navy.

17:17.437 --> 17:22.285
Certainly I had complete policy direction from 
the Secretary to do that because there was so much

17:17.437 --> 17:22.285
to be done. I didn't mean you gold-plated or do it in 
a great fence, but it meant you were able to help

17:22.602 --> 17:26.409
them. And, you know, sometimes I can't put the ship 
to sea, not because I need all the money, but I have

17:26.429 --> 17:33.082
to tie a ship up because I don't have the last 
$100,000. Another thing we had then, too, which

17:33.162 --> 17:45.606
was very interesting, and that is I don't know how 
Mr. Wakelin accomplished it, but we had attention

17:33.162 --> 17:45.606
in then the Bureau of the Budget, which is now the 
Office of Management, and we had a man at level

17:46.177 --> 17:53.083
three or four within the Bureau of the Budget who 
physically sat on the coordinating committees,

17:46.177 --> 17:53.083
and we did have some effect on other agencies' 
budgets. And also, when the Navy ran the

17:53.704 --> 18:06.596
interagency committee, the Navy, in spite of what 
Ed Wink and other people say, had its staff under

17:53.704 --> 18:06.596
Bob Abel totally separate from the Navy, and they 
didn't work for the Navy except as billets, but

17:53.704 --> 18:06.596
they did not. They were funded by the Navy, but they 
didn't take the Navy position, and they didn't

18:07.236 --> 18:13.162
know what the hell the Navy position was. So they 
were truly an interagency group. And we were

18:15.421 --> 18:19.887
criticized because the stationary they put out 
was put out as an interagency stationary. But I

18:20.327 --> 18:21.388
think that was proper. They were trying to do 
interagency work instead of Department of the

18:21.408 --> 18:26.755
Navy work. When people start feuding with each 
other, it's very difficult to do anything

18:26.775 --> 18:33.523
together. And you've probably read Ed Wink's 
book, Ocean Policy or the Politics of the Ocean.

18:38.209 --> 18:40.792
He's an interesting individual. I think made a lot 
of contributions but I think was unwilling to use

18:45.172 --> 18:48.076
the Navy. And I think in oceanography, whether you 
like it or not, you have to use the Navy because the

18:48.096 --> 18:53.843
Navy's there. And I think you have to sucker the 
Navy into helping other people because there's

18:55.305 --> 19:03.997
certain things that no other agency could 
generate a critical mass to do it. What other

19:04.017 --> 19:12.748
agency could generate a critical mass in the 60s to 
have built the navigational satellite system, to

19:04.017 --> 19:12.748
have built the submarine, to have... 
computerized half the world. Well, do you think

19:15.763 --> 19:27.401
there would have even have been an interest in, for 
example, oceanography developed in the academic

19:15.763 --> 19:27.401
world, or not such things as deep scattering 
layers, or bathya thermometers to measure

19:15.763 --> 19:27.401
thermoclines, or? Maybe there would have been by 
the 1980s, 90s, or 2000, but certainly the Navy was

19:27.561 --> 19:40.101
the one that, as a result of his bad experience in 
World War II, in fact, drove the focus in

19:27.561 --> 19:40.101
oceanography. But it was the Navy that forced 
still the National Science Foundation into it. It

19:44.492 --> 19:46.896
wasn't the National Science Foundation 
competing with ONR. The Navy actually lobbied to

19:47.457 --> 19:52.424
get the foundation into oceanography because we 
benefit from what they're doing. It was Dr.

19:53.445 --> 20:06.985
Wakelin, initially, who wanted the buoy system 
under the Coast Guard, who wanted the Sea Grant

19:53.445 --> 20:06.985
Program under the National Science Foundation 
and not under the Navy. The earlier years were very

20:07.454 --> 20:09.216
cooperative. The latter years, because of the 
forces of the dollar and so forth, have been

20:09.276 --> 20:13.742
perhaps less cooperative. Although I would say, 
from where I sit, the academic community has been

20:13.802 --> 20:21.150
between 90% plus cooperative all the time. They 
have their feuds among themselves, like we all do.

20:23.854 --> 20:27.578
But I think that I certainly still feel that 
they're fully cooperative. And I am not the major

20:28.519 --> 20:31.803
funder of the academic community anymore. I've 
dropped from number one to number three,

20:31.843 --> 20:34.947
probably. I take it that in terms of the move that 
you make to Gulfport, I think this will not

20:35.585 --> 20:45.018
separate you from cooperation with ONR and NSF. 
No, because I will continue as a person to stay here

20:45.058 --> 20:55.592
myself and maintain the bureaucracy to fight for 
the dollars and to articulate the program and

20:45.058 --> 20:55.592
fight that in the joint arena. But I think the 
technical workmanship coming out of the other

20:55.612 --> 21:01.440
elements of the program that were scattered 
around Washington will be further away from the

21:01.910 --> 21:11.479
bureaucratic hot air that comes out of this town 
and therefore may be able to get together better

21:01.910 --> 21:11.479
with the academic community technically as 
opposed to bureaucratically. I still will not put

21:12.280 --> 21:20.167
bureaucracy down in the technical activity, but 
I'm going to try to separate out technical

21:12.280 --> 21:20.167
accomplishment from bureaucratic hot air. 
That's hard to do, and you know that, but it's just

21:20.407 --> 21:24.812
the way our system works. I'm not being negative. 
It's just that we are so big in this country that you

21:25.973 --> 21:30.617
just can't survive without a lot of bureaucracy. 
seeing a lot of hot air. Now, I want to go back to 63

21:32.952 --> 21:36.857
again. When you looked upon the problems you felt 
as if you had in the Naval Department of

21:38.459 --> 21:49.331
Oceanography, or the Oceanographic Department 
of the Navy, really, then how did you try to direct

21:38.459 --> 21:49.331
your department at once? What were your immediate 
short-range goals? Where did you think, in what

21:52.454 --> 21:57.340
ways should oceanography be? Well, the first 
place we tried to move it was expand it in the

21:57.360 --> 22:00.283
academic community. because if you look at the 
rationale for a subject which you understand very

22:01.175 --> 22:27.434
little, you ask yourself, well, since you can't 
foresee exactly what you're going to need and what

22:01.175 --> 22:27.434
you're going to have, like the game we were playing 
before, you say, all right, we need to pump more

22:01.175 --> 22:27.434
money into the basic part of it, and we are pleased 
with what we see with regard to the capability of

22:01.175 --> 22:27.434
the people that exist in the academic world, so why 
can't we get more people involved in the academic

22:01.175 --> 22:27.434
world and build up the academic program? You do 
this simultaneously with trying to Then answer

22:30.520 --> 22:33.283
yourself, what are your capital assets you need? 
And the capital assets we needed or thought we

22:34.405 --> 22:38.490
needed were more ships, more modern ships. We 
involved, parallel to that, a shipbuilding

22:39.471 --> 22:45.999
program for the academic world and for the Navy. 
And thirdly, and I think not lastly, but I think

22:46.019 --> 22:59.515
almost just as important, was the sudden 
realization that the Thresher disaster should

22:46.019 --> 22:59.515
have awakened us to the fact that we may need to 
operate at any time at any depth because we didn't

22:46.019 --> 22:59.515
know what our competition was doing. And I look at a 
military enemy as a competition, because you win

23:00.220 --> 23:10.149
when you've got a better product if you're 
commercial and you do the same thing in the

23:00.220 --> 23:10.149
military. And a better product is people and 
training and equipment and knowledge. And I think

23:15.393 --> 23:30.126
the Soviets have shown us how fast they could come 
from zero knowledge in the oceans to, and I'm

23:15.393 --> 23:30.126
speaking knowledge-wise, not military-wise, 
and how they're integrating their military

23:15.393 --> 23:30.126
operations in such a sense that the knowledge of 
the ocean allows them to get an edge on occasion

23:30.359 --> 23:35.004
over us. And I guess the scariest part was ocean 
engineering, because any one of us who's ever been

23:36.206 --> 23:46.677
in a major development program knows the 
difference between dollars for an academic

23:36.206 --> 23:46.677
scientific endeavor and an engineering 
endeavor. And that's several orders of

23:46.717 --> 23:51.282
magnitude. I think my knowledge with the Polaris 
program had already taught me just how costly And I

23:58.135 --> 24:15.354
guess I have to retract the statement and say that 
my first time in oceanography really was with the

23:58.135 --> 24:15.354
Polaris program because then was a sudden 
realization that you couldn't get a missile

23:58.135 --> 24:15.354
launched from a platform under the water through 
the air surface interface without knowing, one,

23:58.135 --> 24:15.354
where it was, and two, how to go through this 
interface. And I began to recognize for the first

24:15.675 --> 24:24.885
time how little we knew, how lacking we were even in 
such basic things as charts for submarines. and

24:25.625 --> 24:41.719
also how little we knew on our accuracy of our 
navigation, because I'd grown through the same

24:25.625 --> 24:41.719
reform school and been told that the nautical 
almanac was accurate within 100 yards, and I was

24:25.625 --> 24:41.719
too proud to say when I took a star sight that I 
didn't know exactly where I was, and it wasn't

24:25.625 --> 24:41.719
until later in life I realized I was five miles off. 
I got smarter as I got older. But I think that was not

24:45.102 --> 24:53.910
age, that was just a... You'd been taught all your 
life that this is an accurate way to navigate, and

24:45.102 --> 24:53.910
it is mathematically, but You add all the errors 
together of a rolling ship and a sextant and a mark

24:54.228 --> 25:01.739
one eyeball, and you get yourself a lot of errors, a 
lot of errors. So I guess there was an involvement

25:02.761 --> 25:10.853
there, even if it wasn't an over-depriving 
interest.

25:10.873 --> 25:17.703
So I take it then that towards ocean engineering is 
where you aimed the program right then, right? I

25:17.723 --> 25:18.464
aimed it three ways. I aimed it in the increased 
significantly, like an order of magnitude, the

25:18.545 --> 25:23.492
academic program in Rio. And when I say an order of 
magnitude, I don't mean 10 times the dollars. I

25:26.880 --> 25:31.727
mean 10 times the academic mandate's 
involvement. In other words, how many people are

25:31.747 --> 25:36.714
working on research in the field? And you've got to 
be careful here because we kept our money growing

25:36.895 --> 25:49.753
slowly, but in reality the number of mandates that 
we have today is half of what we had in the 60s, 10

25:36.895 --> 25:49.753
years apart because of inflation and because of 
cost of ship outbreaks. So I wanted to go up several

25:51.687 --> 25:54.952
orders of magnitude in academic involvement. I 
wanted to go up in capital investment on ships and

25:54.972 --> 25:58.838
computers. I never won the business on computers. 
The academic world started to do that, but the Navy

26:00.861 --> 26:05.968
world really never got to where I thought it should 
be. And thirdly, and parallel to this, the real

26:06.669 --> 26:11.697
weakness in the Navy side of the program was real 
clear. We just didn't have the technology to be

26:12.298 --> 26:20.530
able to see what the other guy is doing or go down on 
the bottom of the ocean or retrieve things or this

26:12.298 --> 26:20.530
sort of thing. And that was costly, and that was 
really costly. In fact, of course, we don't have

26:25.079 --> 26:27.583
that capability today. Instead of the goal I set of 
six rescue vehicles, we have two, and neither of

26:27.603 --> 26:34.393
them are fully operational, and that was 10 years 
ago. You know, it's frustrating when you stop and

26:35.594 --> 26:38.459
realize it. Now, when you make overtures to the 
academic community, you try to extend your

26:38.479 --> 26:44.768
liaison to the academic community, did you try to 
meet academicians? Oh, yeah. That was in the

26:46.070 --> 26:46.951
beginning. Well... Working on the Interagency 
Committee with the National Academy of Sciences,

26:48.252 --> 26:56.020
I was actually either visiting their places or 
meeting them in Washington almost on a weekly

26:48.252 --> 26:56.020
basis. And again, you've got to remember that 
these people were interested in the Navy's

26:56.801 --> 27:00.064
problems. These people weren't just interested 
in the buck or the size of their university. They

27:04.328 --> 27:06.431
were truly interested in some of the Navy's 
problems. And I think this is a uniqueness in this

27:06.491 --> 27:14.379
field that was almost unparalleled, except 
perhaps during the war in the Manhattan Project.

27:14.399 --> 27:17.702
But certainly, we had no problem with this. In 
fact, even the anti-military feeling in Vietnam,

27:18.003 --> 27:26.652
even though it caused a few minor problems in 
certain universities, really didn't impact on

27:18.003 --> 27:26.652
oceanography.

27:30.156 --> 27:39.405
Now, and so you make liaisons to the academic 
community, you have them work on specialized

27:30.156 --> 27:39.405
problems, and you also have them do work on 
generalized research as departments grow. In

27:39.425 --> 27:42.789
terms of ocean engineering, then, did you try to 
tie that into the academic world also? No. At that

27:43.410 --> 27:46.693
time, I did not try to tie ocean engineering into 
the academic world. except in one or two cases. And

27:48.648 --> 28:00.139
that was a realization that certain tools that you 
could design, you could give to the academic

27:48.648 --> 28:00.139
community, and they could operate them for you in a 
better environment than, say, a military

27:48.648 --> 28:00.139
environment. And the example of that, I guess the 
classic example of that, is the FLIP vehicle for

28:00.159 --> 28:07.286
Scripps and the Alvin for Woods Hole. And I'm still 
working on that kind of philosophical approach.

28:14.483 --> 28:24.556
And, of course, the MISAR for the Naval Research 
Lab, which the Naval Research Lab at that time in

28:14.483 --> 28:24.556
that particular group was very close, if you will, 
to an academic type of graduate training level. I

28:25.338 --> 28:29.844
think that that's perhaps the best way to do it 
then. Today, it'd be interesting to get the

28:29.884 --> 28:42.921
universities in the engineering field, but I 
wanted to make real concrete, specific

28:29.884 --> 28:42.921
improvements, like the physical capability of 
taking a man out of the out of a submarine, or taking

28:43.238 --> 28:49.644
them off of a submersible, or going down on the 
ocean floor with a man. Now, there's an

28:51.046 --> 29:03.498
interesting thing, because in the biomedical 
side of aspect, in the engineering side, because I

28:51.046 --> 29:03.498
sort of put man, the sea, and the engineering side 
of the Navy, we actually chose to do 80% of that work

28:51.046 --> 29:03.498
in universities. Now, we're doing some of it 
in-house with the National Institute of Health

29:04.759 --> 29:12.807
and with the Naval NMRI, the Naval Medical 
Research Institute of Bethesda. But, for

29:13.411 --> 29:28.431
example, the work being done at Penn and Duke and 
those kinds of places are significant and are

29:13.411 --> 29:28.431
making major contributions and have an advantage 
over the Navy that they can, they don't have to be as

29:13.411 --> 29:28.431
hidebound by blood-written regulations as we 
are. They can perhaps go further in the forefront

29:28.451 --> 29:32.557
than we can, perhaps. So that balance there was 
done intentionally. But the rest of engineering,

29:36.302 --> 29:42.490
universities are not good places in general to 
build weapons systems or large systems. They can

29:44.242 --> 29:45.406
probably do it. And what I mean probably, they did 
it. They built the album. But they take a long time

29:49.981 --> 29:53.914
to do it.
