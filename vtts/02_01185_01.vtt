00:10.747 --> 00:21.466
Okay, this is Ron Shorn at University of 
California, Berkeley,

00:10.747 --> 00:21.466
interviewing Peter Boyce. And let's start at the 
beginning. Peter, what's your full name? It's

00:25.733 --> 00:27.215
Peter Bradford Boyce. And when and where were you 
born? Born in New York City on November 30th, 1936.

00:31.904 --> 00:36.231
How did you first get interested in astronomy? I 
took a course from Bart Bach at Harvard. What were

00:39.628 --> 00:41.109
you majoring in then? I was going to be pre-med. And 
one course in astronomy, and it was all over.

00:47.036 --> 00:57.707
Actually, I was prepared for it because my father, 
we lived in the country, moved out of New York City

00:47.036 --> 00:57.707
at the age of one and a half, one of the best 
decisions in my life, I think. And moved to the

00:57.728 --> 01:02.893
country, and my father was very interested in the 
seasons. We did farming and the change of the sun

01:02.953 --> 01:06.437
and the return of the sun. that allowed us to start 
planning again was really important to my father,

01:06.805 --> 01:14.237
who was a novelist by trade. And so we used to go out 
and look at the northern lights and the

01:15.159 --> 01:21.810
constellations appearance of a dog star showed 
that winter was coming along. And so we always were

01:26.318 --> 01:28.700
interested in the sky. And when I was in high 
school, I went to the school whose football coach

01:29.480 --> 01:36.727
was the father of Walter Orr Roberts. And Walter 
Roberts came in and gave a couple of lectures in the

01:37.587 --> 01:41.971
school. And of course, the kind of thing he was 
doing at the high altitude observatory and making

01:42.952 --> 01:52.000
time lapse movies of the solar prominence is 
really exciting to a young kid. And I got

01:56.693 --> 02:02.500
interested enough to want to build my own 
telescope, which I did in high school. But I wasn't

02:02.940 --> 02:05.604
thinking of that as a career. I'm not even sure I 
knew that astronomy was a viable career at that

02:05.684 --> 02:09.769
time. And I went to Harvard, really set to major in 
pre-med because I wanted to be a doctor. had a

02:20.330 --> 02:31.462
semester course to spare in chemistry, because I 
took the full year of chemistry in half a year as an

02:20.330 --> 02:31.462
advanced course. And I had a year of science to 
spare and took an astronomy course, and that was

02:31.482 --> 02:35.967
it. Did you switch majors? Well, I don't think we 
had to really declare a major in the freshman year,

02:39.651 --> 02:48.480
but I'm sure after that, I immediately declared as 
a sophomore be an astronomy major, and we had 11

02:49.085 --> 03:04.282
other astronomy undergraduate majors that year, 
and they set up a whole series of courses designed

02:49.085 --> 03:04.282
to accommodate both the astronomy major students 
and the beginning graduate students. So we had a

03:05.123 --> 03:13.673
mixture of courses that were absolutely 
fantastic as a preparation for further work in

03:05.123 --> 03:13.673
astronomy. What year did you get your bachelor's 
degree? 1958. Then where did you go to graduate

03:18.565 --> 03:20.607
school? I went to grad school in Michigan. Married 
a woman who was a year behind me, and she

03:23.310 --> 03:29.578
accelerated, and I waited six months. So I got to 
Michigan in January of 59. And when I came to

03:34.363 --> 03:40.810
Michigan, it was a time of great change. And they 
came to Michigan to study under the faculty of

03:40.891 --> 03:48.319
Aller, Liller, Miller, Mueller, Moeller, and 
Goldberg. And by the time I left, all of them had

03:48.518 --> 03:53.947
departed the scene except Freeman Miller. Yeah, 
that was described as a supernova explosion.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.535
Yeah, something like that. The legislature 
wouldn't give them a big telescope. That's right,

04:00.919 --> 04:01.881
yeah. So I got my doctorate in 63. Okay, who was your 
thesis advisor and what did you do? I worked on the

04:10.034 --> 04:29.634
Orion Nebula, used Bob Tull's scanner that he 
built for his thesis, photoelectric spectrum

04:10.034 --> 04:29.634
scanner, single channel, and observed the 
hydrogen bomber decrement in the Orion Nebula.

04:30.495 --> 04:37.982
And by comparing the strengths of the lines with 
the theoretical calculations, I was able to show

04:30.495 --> 04:37.982
that There was a lot of dust in the nebula or in front 
of the nebula. It was central with the nebula,

04:42.258 --> 04:44.364
however. I forgot to mention the date. This is June 
7, 1993.

04:52.863 --> 04:56.707
Okay, you got your PhD, and then presumably you got 
a job. I got a job at Lowell Observatory. How did you

04:59.249 --> 05:01.131
get that kind of job? Well, John Hall had done some 
polarization studies in the Orion Nebula, and I

05:01.831 --> 05:19.528
found an AAS abstract of it and no other reference 
to it, so I called him and wrote him and asked for

05:01.831 --> 05:19.528
further data, and he sent me some data and said it 
was never published, though. But it, again, was

05:20.032 --> 05:26.081
sort of confirmatory that there was a lot of dust 
involved in the nebular complex. So I

05:28.225 --> 05:43.408
said I was getting out soon, and also just because 
of that, I asked him if there were any jobs around

05:28.225 --> 05:43.408
Lowell and got a letter back inviting me to come and 
interview. So Bill Sinton had gotten... NSF

05:46.998 --> 05:50.463
grant, I guess, and had money to hire somebody. 
When did you arrive at Moab? 1963 in September.

05:57.753 --> 06:03.922
That September, about a week after I arrived, we 
had an observing run with the interferometer. I

06:04.022 --> 06:05.925
knew nothing about interferometry. It was an 
interferometric spectrometer. a root keel prism

06:10.454 --> 06:18.423
interferometer in the 2 micron range. And we had 10 
clear days, 10 clear nights, actually. And what

06:25.171 --> 06:25.932
telescope? Well, at that time, it was the 69-inch 
telescope at Anderson Mesa at Lowell. And it was

06:34.602 --> 06:40.208
the original Ohio State, Ohio Wesleyan 
telescope. And so we worked our butts off. And I

06:43.046 --> 06:53.957
thought, boy, this is quite different from my 
thesis in Michigan, where I actually went to a New

06:43.046 --> 06:53.957
Year's Eve party one clear night instead of going 
out to the telescope. And it was March before I

06:54.318 --> 06:58.061
could get back on the telescope again because of 
the weather. So I thought I was in heaven. Of

06:59.683 --> 07:02.927
course, that's the same thing as the Brouwer 
fortnight. I never got 10 clear nights in a row

07:02.967 --> 07:07.191
again on my whole 10 years at Lowell. It was an 
exciting time. What objects were you observing?

07:10.946 --> 07:14.010
We were observing cool stars, long period 
variable stars. And one of the, the only place we

07:14.691 --> 07:30.394
published it was in Stein Telescope, but we did 
detect water, the water bands in Tri-Signe and

07:14.691 --> 07:30.394
showed that they went away at maximum light and 
were strongly there at minimum light. Global, of

07:30.374 --> 07:39.630
course, is most famous for planetary work, but 
they always did, from the very beginning, do

07:30.374 --> 07:39.630
stellar and galactic work. Well, that's right. 
Bill was doing a lot of planetary work originally,

07:41.733 --> 07:54.354
and I think he kind of got discouraged, I guess, 
when he had this false positive detection of the

07:41.733 --> 07:54.354
C-H band on Mars. And so he was... doing stellar 
astronomy at that time. But he liked to do the

08:00.565 --> 08:01.948
instruments. He liked to fiddle with them and make 
them work. And building on Larry Mertz's

08:05.033 --> 08:18.117
interferometry experience where Larry and Bill 
Sinton crossed paths at Harvard while I was an

08:05.033 --> 08:18.117
undergraduate there, actually, And Bill had 
built this interferometer, and it was really

08:18.097 --> 08:25.987
working very well. I mean, we got some nice spectra 
for the time. Of course, these days, what we would

08:29.552 --> 08:35.419
spend all night on, they can do in 10 minutes. When 
you started at Lowell, who was on the staff there?

08:38.984 --> 08:39.304
Do you remember? Well, John Hall was the director. 
E.C. Slipher was still alive, buried in the midst

08:43.111 --> 08:56.694
of his cigar box filing system of all the plates of 
Mars that they had ever taken at various

08:43.111 --> 08:56.694
Lowell-funded telescopes. Bill Sinton was 
there. Bill Tift was there. I

09:02.765 --> 09:10.518
was trying to remember who was there when we first 
came. Some of the exciting people. I think

09:12.501 --> 09:22.377
when I showed up that year, Karl Rakos from Austria 
was there for the first time.

09:23.757 --> 09:27.023
Wojtek Cieminski had been there and gone. I

09:27.043 --> 09:35.279
don't remember who else right now was on the staff 
at the beginning. When you got there, was there

09:35.921 --> 09:38.506
much planetary work being done? There wasn't a lot 
of planetary work at that time. The Slifers were

09:45.138 --> 09:58.570
taking some pictures, but there was a lot of 
preparation, I think, for the coming Planetary

09:45.138 --> 09:58.570
Center and excitement. I guess the big thing that 
was going on was the ACIC project, the Lunar

09:59.491 --> 10:07.798
Mapping Project, and the Aeronautical Chart and 
Information Center. There were as many people

10:08.379 --> 10:13.423
doing that as we had people on the Lowell staff. And 
they tied up the 24-inch telescope most of the

10:14.095 --> 10:25.067
time, doing a lot of visual filling in of details on 
the map.

10:28.430 --> 10:37.580
When you went there, did you feel that real 
astronomers looked down on people that worked at

10:28.430 --> 10:37.580
Lowell Territory? Well, I was too naive to know 
whether to consider that. I was just charged up to

10:43.703 --> 10:47.748
be going to a place that had such a name. I

10:47.788 --> 10:54.976
was fairly well treated, I must say. And every 
paper that I was given, I'd given at meetings and so

10:54.996 --> 11:01.283
forth. It was received pretty well. I didn't seem 
to feel too discriminated against. What I did feel

11:07.490 --> 11:10.613
very strongly was that the old-time planetary 
astronomers would look down upon, people who

11:11.234 --> 11:19.983
would look at either an image. I mean, E.C. Slipher 
would pick an image out. Now, he obviously was

11:23.647 --> 11:39.064
looking through the telescope at the same time, 
and this colored his vision of what he saw on the

11:23.647 --> 11:39.064
photograph, but he would point out things and say, 
this is low-lying morning haze, and this over here

11:23.647 --> 11:39.064
is afternoon cumulus. when he had no basis for 
being able to differentiate that kind of thing at

11:39.247 --> 11:47.360
all on Mars. And so I also was very skeptical that 
this was real science, just having somebody sit

11:47.921 --> 11:58.859
there and give their opinions of what they were 
actually seeing. What was the attitude of the

11:59.780 --> 12:05.389
staff members towards the late Percival Lowell?

12:07.850 --> 12:14.097
Oh, I guess we're pretty grateful that he had 
founded the observatory. We're grateful that he

12:14.157 --> 12:16.220
sent A.E. Douglas out looking for a place and 
grateful of the citizens of Flagstaff who met the

12:16.260 --> 12:34.060
train with a brass band and escorted him up Mars 
Hill or what was to become Mars Hill and grateful

12:16.260 --> 12:34.060
that it was clear and rather good observing 
conditions at the time he was searching for the

12:16.260 --> 12:34.060
site. You know, Lowell had a, I guess we sort of 
wished that he had not passed away so soon because

12:35.440 --> 13:00.773
clearly the observatory was eking along hand to 
mouth on the endowment, the rather minuscule

12:35.440 --> 13:00.773
endowment which the observatory had, and we all 
felt, I think, that it would have been much bigger

13:01.023 --> 13:12.919
had Lowell survived a little bit longer and the 
estate hadn't been in such a turmoil and put such a

13:01.023 --> 13:12.919
pinch on the observatory during the 30s and 40s. 
When you were there, was Lowell still in the string

13:13.680 --> 13:22.912
and bailing wire hand-to-mouth existence that it 
was famous for? Oh yeah, sure. I mean, that was very

13:25.340 --> 13:50.250
frustrating at times, and you couldn't buy enough 
screwdrivers to be sure that you always had one at

13:25.340 --> 13:50.250
the telescope, although Henry Giklis used to say 
he was absolutely certain that the top of Anderson

13:25.340 --> 13:50.250
Mesa was littered with screwdrivers six inches 
deep somewhere, because he had bought so many. You

13:50.956 --> 13:53.100
stayed at Lowell for 10 years. Yes. And what did you 
work on? Well, I started out to work with Bill

13:55.204 --> 14:01.235
Sinton and then on the Orion Nebula again. And then 
I built a spectrum scanner funded by the

14:01.275 --> 14:14.500
observatory itself and started to use that on 
planetary nebulae.

14:16.555 --> 14:44.622
Then I built, following Carl Rakosh's visit, 
where he developed what he called an area scanner,

14:16.555 --> 14:44.622
which was a way to wipe a slit across the star, a 
double star in particular, and get a profile of the

14:16.555 --> 14:44.622
two components, which you could then deconvolve 
and get much more accurate photoelectric

14:16.555 --> 14:44.622
magnitudes for stars which were normally too 
close to resolve in conventional photometry.

14:45.732 --> 15:12.398
this was such a powerful technique that i began to 
use it and put a spectrum i mean a scanning aperture

14:45.732 --> 15:12.398
in front of my spectrum scanner at scanning and 
right angles to the dispersion and i used then the

14:45.732 --> 15:12.398
spectrum scanner as a movable square bandpass 
very well defined bandpass filter and

15:13.070 --> 15:29.532
turn to my love of gaseous nebulae and would scan 
these planetary nebulae and H-alpha, H-beta, and

15:13.070 --> 15:29.532
the oxygen lines and so forth, and look at the 
structure of the planetary nebulae. And then one

15:30.253 --> 15:35.881
night, Mars was up in the sky, and people were kind 
of excited because it was an opposition. And I

15:36.041 --> 15:36.942
looked at it. And of course, it's a gorgeous sight 
for somebody who'd never paid much attention to

15:37.002 --> 15:42.570
planets before. And I said, well, I'll try to scan 
it. Scanning a planetary nebula meant for me, a

15:48.950 --> 16:09.418
planetary nebula meant for me being on there for 
half an hour, 45 minutes, and then building up

15:48.950 --> 16:09.418
enough statistics that you would have a 
reasonably noise-free profile of the

15:48.950 --> 16:09.418
distribution of the element you were looking at 
across the nebula. So I did the same thing to Mars,

16:11.719 --> 16:19.012
and in 30 seconds, I had the biggest, brightest, 
most noise-free profile that I'd ever seen in my

16:11.719 --> 16:19.012
life. And so I thought, well, this is maybe 
something I should do. And I looked at Mars. I

16:26.745 --> 16:27.607
looked in the red. I looked in the blue. And the 
profiles were so different. And of course, you

16:32.353 --> 16:36.761
can't see any details on the surface in blue. And 
you could in red. And I thought, well, gee, I could

16:39.044 --> 16:41.889
measure some of the differences here. And I began 
to look at the planetary literature to see what was

16:41.949 --> 16:52.367
known and what kind of accurate measurements had 
been made of the surface photometry of the

16:41.949 --> 16:52.367
different areas of the planet. I found there was 
nothing, really nothing. And I said, well, this is

16:55.518 --> 16:57.000
fine. So I started to work on the planets then. Did 
you ever get any NASA support for that work, or was

17:01.245 --> 17:05.010
it observatory? If I got, well, John Hall had the 
peculiar, and as I later found out, absolutely

17:06.492 --> 17:24.394
false assumption that if you put in a proposal and 
it was turned down, you got a black mark in the

17:06.492 --> 17:24.394
agency's book. And so you should never put in a 
proposal unless you were absolutely sure it was

17:25.387 --> 17:30.536
going to be funded. And he didn't think that my 
suggestions for proposals would immediately get

17:31.277 --> 17:38.329
funded, and so he didn't want me to send them in. I 
think that my salary was partly paid by the NASA

17:39.091 --> 17:44.059
contract from time to time. This was after the 
Planetary Center had been established and Bill

17:44.099 --> 17:49.048
Baum had come. Ten years after you came, had the 
observatory, had NASA money really changed? Oh

17:57.883 --> 17:59.445
yes, it changed it a lot. First of all, the 
Planetary Center gave us a new building, really

18:01.327 --> 18:16.403
major facilities

18:01.327 --> 18:16.403
for a lot of things and money for instrumentation 
that was highly welcome. and made a major impact.

18:20.521 --> 18:30.779
We expanded the staff in the workshops and things 
like that, but it just made a difference in night

18:20.521 --> 18:30.779
and day. At the same time, Bill Sinton and I had 
gotten into using locally available computers

18:36.717 --> 18:48.211
first down at the business school at the NAU, which 
was the first computer in Flagstaff, an old IBM

18:36.717 --> 18:48.211
1620. And we rewrote the Fourier transform 
program that Bill was using to produce the spectra

18:48.231 --> 19:03.489
from his interferograms to run on the 1620. And 
then we... finally persuaded Lowell that they had

19:06.383 --> 19:24.329
to buy an IBM 1130, which was sort of the first 
reasonably priced computer that a smaller

19:06.383 --> 19:24.329
institution could afford to really get that had 
sufficient capability to be a worthwhile

19:06.383 --> 19:24.329
computer. So we got the 1130, and Bill and I were put 
in charge of it, and I eventually became sort of the

19:24.389 --> 19:32.340
director the de facto director of the computer 
center for four years. After Lowell, where did you

19:36.117 --> 19:40.022
go? After Lowell, I came to NSF as a program 
director for astronomical instrumentation for

19:41.304 --> 19:54.083
supposedly for two years and stayed for six, I 
guess, 73 to 79. And then where did you go?

19:59.641 --> 20:27.336
last year or the next to the last year that stay at 
nsf i got a department of commerce science and

19:59.641 --> 20:27.336
technology fellowship and spent a year on capitol 
hill working for mo udall came back discovered

19:59.641 --> 20:27.336
that the nsf as an agency didn't want to know about 
my experience on the hill didn't want to put it to

19:59.641 --> 20:27.336
any use at all and in fact the congressional office 
at nsf thought that any suggestions I made were

20:27.907 --> 20:57.475
poaching on their territory and so I was really 
what I had learned was just never put to use at all

20:27.907 --> 20:57.475
and I was so disgusted that this kind of thing was 
going on when I could see that there were things

20:27.907 --> 20:57.475
that NSF should do to change its image in Congress 
and I applied for the job of

20:58.028 --> 21:16.967
executive officer of the AAS, which at that point 
came open, I sort of applied as a lark and

20:58.028 --> 21:16.967
discovered that my ideas of where the society 
should go and the search committee's ideas were

20:58.028 --> 21:16.967
really so congruent as to be a remarkable match. 
And they hired me, and that's where I've been ever

21:17.607 --> 21:20.290
since. Well, as the executive director, you have 
the continuity that the other officers lack. One

21:28.454 --> 21:47.552
thing I want to ask you from your standpoint

21:28.454 --> 21:47.552
is the creation of separate sub-societies, such 
as the original one, which is high energy

21:28.454 --> 21:47.552
astrophysics, but then vision for planetary 
astronomy. There was a lot of worry that this would

21:47.572 --> 21:51.936
split up astronomy and all that sort of stuff. Do 
you think that the, well, what do you think about

21:51.956 --> 21:57.921
these divisions? I have mixed emotions.

22:02.407 --> 22:04.709
I think by and large it's a very important thing. 
When the planetary division, let me start with the

22:05.109 --> 22:17.660
high energy astrophysics division, they

22:05.109 --> 22:17.660
have to be members of the parent society in order to 
be members of the division. And that has worked out

22:18.401 --> 22:20.863
very well. It's given an impetus to the high energy 
astrophysics, which I think was very important at

22:28.259 --> 22:30.882
the time the division was started. Well, weren't 
those guys threatening to go to the American

22:31.343 --> 22:34.788
Geophysical Union? No, this is the high energy. 
Oh, this is high energy. Then I think the first

22:38.953 --> 22:44.621
division, in fact, was the planetary division. 
And I think that also was very important because

22:45.121 --> 22:52.131
planetary astronomy sort of had three homes. 
There were a number of people who were astronomers

22:52.171 --> 22:55.515
and belonged to the AAS. There were a number of 
people who were atmospheric physicists who

22:55.765 --> 23:04.512
belonged to the, well, I suppose the American 
Meteorological Society. And then the planetary

23:05.593 --> 23:10.538
surface geologists mostly belonged to AGU. And 
there was no one place where they could feel at

23:11.218 --> 23:14.461
home. And part of the major rationale for 
establishing the planetary division was, in

23:14.521 --> 23:25.030
fact, to give them a home where they didn't have to 
pay too much in the way of dues, so we did have the

23:25.398 --> 23:49.443
affiliate membership, division affiliate 
membership, with very low dues, but it provided an

23:25.398 --> 23:49.443
opportunity where they all had a home and you could 
meet and have all these people attend the meeting

23:25.398 --> 23:49.443
without having to pay the much higher dues of the 
parent society. And I think that's a very

23:49.463 --> 23:54.628
important function, and I think it's been very, 
very healthy for the planetary field as a whole.

23:58.624 --> 24:03.228
People always make comments like, well, it's too 
bad that they're diverging and everything. But I

24:03.288 --> 24:08.814
just wonder in the good old days, for example, did 
Alistair pay any attention whatsoever to

24:03.288 --> 24:08.814
planetary studies? Oh, no. There was no. That was 
getting back to one of our earlier questions. That

24:14.960 --> 24:20.886
was a really important thing to highlight the fact 
that, in fact, people were doing what I was doing

24:21.878 --> 24:36.058
and trying to bring some kind of modern technology 
and accuracy and real scientific judgment to the

24:21.878 --> 24:36.058
planetary studies. And that was just not very well 
appreciated at all by the conventional stellar

24:36.819 --> 24:42.587
astronomers. I mean, we weren't alone. The solar 
physicists feel, have felt left out from time to

24:46.545 --> 24:52.053
time as well. And I think having the division and 
having the ability to present talks at the main AAS

24:53.836 --> 25:10.482
meetings was very, very important in helping the 
rest of the community to become at least more aware

24:53.836 --> 25:10.482
that Planetary science was not just somebody 
holding up a photograph and saying, well, that's

25:11.103 --> 25:18.392
ground haze over there on the limb. And

25:19.534 --> 25:30.968
now they understand that if you're going to study 
the circulation of the Martian atmosphere, you

25:19.534 --> 25:30.968
have to really do... pretty complex models, even 
though there's no oceans. It makes it a simpler

25:35.650 --> 25:37.493
system, the model. But you model that, and then you 
compare with the observations, and you have the

25:37.773 --> 25:43.921
spacecraft going there. But it's all done by, it 
isn't just pictures anymore, but it's real good

25:43.981 --> 25:51.009
science that's being done. And I think that's 
appreciated much more now than it was. And I think

25:54.874 --> 25:57.057
the formation of the division by giving them a 
strong point to stand on and help the assimilation

25:57.762 --> 26:17.305
or the understanding of planetary astronomy and 
the assimilation of planetary astronomy into

25:57.762 --> 26:17.305
the general overall astronomy picture. Well, 
you've just about answered my next question, is do

26:17.585 --> 26:26.335
you think that planetary astronomer has a higher 
standing now among real quote unquote

26:17.585 --> 26:26.335
astronomers than it did when you got your PhD? Oh, 
yeah, absolutely. No question about it. And it's

26:31.251 --> 26:37.759
partly due to the influx of NASA money and the jobs. 
But that isn't all. I mean, at the beginning, I

26:41.803 --> 26:50.533
think that the sort of consensus would be that the 
and you want to treat this kind of carefully, I

26:51.543 --> 27:04.301
think, but I think the consensus was the original 
people funded by NASA were thought among the

26:51.543 --> 27:04.301
community to be those who couldn't get jobs in real 
astrophysics. But as we get more and more people

27:05.142 --> 27:20.925
coming in from atmospheric physics and 
geophysics,

27:05.142 --> 27:20.925
ended working in planetary astronomy, they bring 
their techniques and their kind of rigor that goes

27:21.580 --> 27:43.621
on in planetary astronomy now is so much higher 
than it was even in the very early stages of NASA

27:21.580 --> 27:43.621
funding that I think we do have a much higher class 
of people doing planetary astronomy now than we

27:21.580 --> 27:43.621
did before. And so the easy NASA money, although it 
fueled a tremendous growth, also had a negative

27:48.698 --> 28:05.042
effect in that you would probably reach further 
down into the barrel of people than was probably

27:48.698 --> 28:05.042
wise in terms of the quality of people that you were 
funding. And again, that's a reputation that took

28:05.342 --> 28:14.115
a while to dissipate, and I'm not sure it's 
completely dissipated yet. Well, now, in

28:14.652 --> 28:21.338
addition to having their own sub-society, 
planetary astronomers got their own journal,

28:14.652 --> 28:21.338
Icarus. And so you don't see planetary papers in 
the astrophysical journal or astronomical

28:22.079 --> 28:27.424
journal. Of course, other people made the comment 
that there never were very many in there anyway.

28:33.129 --> 28:38.715
But do you think that the fountain that, let's face 
it, Carl Sagan made Icarus. He didn't found it, but

28:38.775 --> 28:42.398
he really turned it into something better than 
what it was. Do you think that's been good for

28:42.833 --> 28:46.337
planetary astronomy? Or astronomy in general? 
Yes and no. I mean, I think journals like Solar

28:49.722 --> 28:55.589
Physics did a major disservice to the solar 
community. I think the case is less clear in

28:56.110 --> 29:08.706
Icarus, because the solar papers would have been 
published in the Apche under Helmut, for sure,

28:56.110 --> 29:08.706
although they might not have been under Chandra. 
And I think having them split off, they agree, was a

29:09.665 --> 29:17.776
major problem and a disaster. And they're trying 
to come back more into the AAS journals now. In the

29:23.283 --> 29:29.191
case of planetary astronomy, I'm not so sure that 
that's the case. I think that having Icarus and

29:29.251 --> 29:37.242
building up its reputation to be a journal that 
people are, in fact, proud to publish in has been

29:37.829 --> 29:43.595
good for planetary astronomy. And I don't think 
the case is as clear cut that it was damaging to

29:43.735 --> 29:57.889
planetary astronomy, because I do think that the 
planetary papers would not have been published in

29:43.735 --> 29:57.889
A.J. It's certainly not in Astrophysical 
Journal. And again, A.G.U. would have published

30:04.375 --> 30:07.498
some of them, but I think having Icarus has been an 
important outlet for the planetary papers, and

30:08.862 --> 30:34.617
it's run by the planetary astronomers 
themselves, the editors of Planetary

30:08.862 --> 30:34.617
Astronomer, and the kinds of topics that are of 
importance, the editorial judgment on these

30:08.862 --> 30:34.617
topics is much better than it could have been in 
either the AJ or the APJ. In your opinion, is

30:34.968 --> 30:38.012
planetary astronomy real astronomy? Of course. I 
mean, astronomy is science, and planetary

30:39.934 --> 30:45.601
astronomy is real science. There's a curious 
parallel between planetary astronomy and radio

30:46.863 --> 30:59.018
astronomy in that in the 40s and 50s, and even into 
the early 60s, they were considered pariahs, not

30:46.863 --> 30:59.018
really respectable. And as you may recall, most of 
the early radio astronomy stuff was published in

30:59.487 --> 31:08.360
Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, 
where my first published paper was, too. And

31:09.602 --> 31:18.655
along with that goes the fact that planetary 
studies were never looked down on by radio

31:09.602 --> 31:18.655
astronomers. Why do you think this is? Well, 
because planets are one of the brightest radio

31:20.978 --> 31:24.904
sources and one of the planet there I mean the radio 
astronomers started building instruments the

31:25.036 --> 31:50.959
first thing they did was look at the planets and of 
course that's a new area nobody's ever looked at

31:25.036 --> 31:50.959
him in the radio region before and so it was it was 
real science real physics and they they applied a

31:25.036 --> 31:50.959
lot of rigor

31:25.036 --> 31:50.959
to the to this planetary study and so they helped I 
think to build the understanding among planetary

31:52.762 --> 31:59.131
astronomers that they had to be a lot more rigorous 
than they traditionally had been before. When you

31:59.892 --> 32:09.787
were at NSF, this was at a time when NASA was doing 
the lion's share of funding for planetary

31:59.892 --> 32:09.787
astronomy in this country. Was NSF giving out any 
money for planetary work? Oh, yes. Yeah, they did.

32:15.175 --> 32:22.245
Ground-based radio astronomy, planetary 
astronomy was done.

32:24.419 --> 32:29.146
at NSF, there were some asteroid studies, I think. 
Those were under Harold Lane's direction. And

32:33.092 --> 32:36.237
he's still around, I think, as far as I know. Might 
be an interesting person to talk to. How did you

32:38.741 --> 32:42.607
people split the pie with NASA? Did you

32:42.647 --> 32:49.037
meet together or send notes and say, we're going to 
fund this? Or didn't you talk at all with NASA? Oh,

32:53.157 --> 33:05.434
well, we just tried to shove as many proposals over 
to NASA as we could, saying that they had a bigger

32:53.157 --> 33:05.434
program and they were better able to judge the 
worth of the proposal. It was an understanding. We

33:07.237 --> 33:16.990
used to meet at least once a year with the program 
directors, and certainly we all knew each other

33:07.237 --> 33:16.990
and call each other on the phone and talk about, 
well, I got a proposal here. What are you funding in

33:17.030 --> 33:19.073
this program? But planetary astronomy was being 
supported at the rate of $30 million a year at NASA

33:21.963 --> 33:30.115
and $1 million at NSF. What can I say? On a different 
point of view, I guess this is about six questions

33:31.216 --> 33:37.826
in one. But what I want to ask you is, what do you 
think the public thinks about astronomy and

33:37.886 --> 33:41.892
astronomy? And then in particular, what do they 
think about planetary astronomy and

33:42.793 --> 33:46.218
astronomers? And then what should they think? 
This is your opinion now. Well, I think that the

33:51.646 --> 33:55.511
public loves astronomy. I think the public 
doesn't think there's any difference between

33:55.591 --> 34:02.661
planetary astronomy and stellar astronomy. They 
look at it all as being the study of the universe,

34:03.743 --> 34:09.530
which I think is the way it should be looked at.

34:14.337 --> 34:15.038
As to what So I think they're equally fascinated by 
the concepts of black holes and Big Bang and the

34:17.380 --> 34:31.599
seeing to the edge of the universe and the fact that 
we have galaxies of 10 to the 11th suns and so on.

34:32.901 --> 34:42.514
Although as we heard today, maybe it's 10 to the 
10th suns and 90% more unseen matter. But they

34:43.055 --> 34:46.780
think these concepts are fascinating. But they 
also just love the idea of exploring other planets

34:47.840 --> 35:12.609
and sending spacecraft there and looking at the 
pictures that come back and understanding storms

34:47.840 --> 35:12.609
on Jupiter and dust storms on Mars and going out to 
the depths of Pluto, I mean, Uranus, and finding

34:47.840 --> 35:12.609
rings on the planets and so on. I think this is a 
fascinating story. Every aspect of it is

35:15.112 --> 35:17.475
fascinating to the public. What should they think 
of astronomy and astronomers? I think they should

35:23.081 --> 35:25.825
be fascinated by it. It's a fascinating field, and 
it's the age-old question, you know, where did we

35:25.845 --> 35:32.155
actually come from? It's why religion was 
invented, or at least part of the reason why

35:32.276 --> 35:42.432
religion was invented, to explain the creation. 
And astronomy is... pushing back the boundaries

35:45.535 --> 35:58.993
where we step from where we know beyond to where we 
don't know and where we speculate and where we have

35:45.535 --> 35:58.993
to make it part of faith or what have you. Even given 
this public interest, have astronomers in

36:00.455 --> 36:11.489
general in this country and planetary 
astronomers in particular, you think they've

36:00.455 --> 36:11.489
done a good job selling themselves to the public 
and the Congress? No, they haven't. We've been

36:14.155 --> 36:19.780
riding on

36:14.155 --> 36:19.780
sort of the Cold War. Everybody must be telling you 
this. We've been riding on the Cold War fear of

36:23.224 --> 36:34.435
Russia and the importance of having a space 
program, the importance of going to the moon and

36:23.224 --> 36:34.435
Mars first and raising the American flag. And all 
of this has helped us to develop

36:43.417 --> 36:54.294
or I developed the funding for astronomy as part of 
this other great job that we have to do for the

36:43.417 --> 36:54.294
country. And that's all changed.

37:03.569 --> 37:07.315
What do you think was the effect, if any, I guess 
maybe I should just, I left that sort of quickly.

37:13.751 --> 37:32.593
What's happened I think is that astronomers have 
sort of mined this mother load of fear of the

37:13.751 --> 37:32.593
Russians and excitement with knowing the 
universe and the money has just sort of come

37:13.751 --> 37:32.593
without them having to really pay back much. and 
that's not going to work anymore, and I think we

37:32.877 --> 38:01.433
have not done an appropriately good job of having 
the Congress and the public understand really

37:32.877 --> 38:01.433
what astronomy is all about, what astronomers can 
do, what kind of things we've done that are useful

37:32.877 --> 38:01.433
to the nation and have been adapted and used 
elsewhere, and the importance of just having

37:32.877 --> 38:01.433
basic research, curiosity-driven research 
funded because you never know when you're going to

38:01.987 --> 38:26.759
stumble on something that you can't explain, like 
in the early 1900s, early part of the century, the

38:01.987 --> 38:26.759
calculation that the sun could not possibly 
support itself except by the gravitational

38:01.987 --> 38:26.759
energy released by its contraction, and then it 
would burn itself up in a few hundred thousand

38:01.987 --> 38:26.759
years, which was incompatible with geological 
record. And that great conundrum led to... really

38:32.328 --> 38:40.785
pushed the development of understanding the 
atomic structure of the atom and the atomic

38:32.328 --> 38:40.785
energy. And do we really know that the black holes 
that we see and the engines in the centers of

38:41.266 --> 38:49.442
quasars are driven by by gravitational energy. 
We're going back to the same old source, but maybe,

38:51.897 --> 38:56.887
maybe, just maybe it's new physics. You never know 
when something like that is going to be absolutely

38:57.007 --> 39:10.215
crucial, will be discovered because somebody is 
curious about a mystery and turns into be one of the

38:57.007 --> 39:10.215
most practical uh developments the important 
developments that we've had in our civilization

39:10.448 --> 39:36.540
this brings up a practical point uh decades now 
ground-based and probe of exploration of the

39:10.448 --> 39:36.540
solar system no trace of life ever existed 
anywhere except on earth what what kind of

39:10.448 --> 39:36.540
negative effect do you think that had on planetary 
astronomy funding and interest but astronomy in

39:10.448 --> 39:36.540
general I don't think it's had much of an impact on 
astronomy funding yet anyway. On planetary

39:45.208 --> 39:47.431
astronomy, it probably...

39:50.215 --> 39:52.418
I don't think it's had a major impact. The failure 
to discover life forms on Mars. I think what's more

39:57.545 --> 40:06.898
exciting to the people is not whether something 
else is out there of a low life form I

40:07.385 --> 40:23.504
think what's more exciting is, in fact, the 
ability of man to perhaps live there, mankind to

40:07.385 --> 40:23.504
live there and colonize it. I think that's a very 
powerful attraction for the public. What do you

40:26.567 --> 40:33.035
think killed planetary astronomy in the early 
part of this century? I don't know. I don't know

40:34.236 --> 40:36.058
enough about what went on. I've heard stories from 
Jerry Crone of pages of observing notebooks being

40:36.207 --> 40:59.776
excised with a razor blade at Lake Observatory 
because, I forget who it was, somebody's drawing

40:36.207 --> 40:59.776
showed changes on Mars that the person, the 
director didn't think was appropriate to have

40:36.207 --> 40:59.776
made public. In other words, he thought that the 
person was seeing things in the middle of the night

40:59.796 --> 41:04.982
that weren't there. What do you think is the state 
of astronomy right now? Good, bad, or

41:09.651 --> 41:10.832
indifferent? It's fabulous right now, and the 
prognosis for the future is looking very grim just

41:12.674 --> 41:26.327
because of the change in the funding paradigm that 
we see facing us right now. And it's not grim to the

41:26.367 --> 41:34.294
point that we will get back to a level of funding 
that we had in the 1950s, but... We've had

41:35.978 --> 41:40.763
unprecedented growth for the last two decades. I 
mean, over the last decade, the Astronomical

41:41.304 --> 41:45.449
Society has grown by 40%. The funding, NASA 
funding, has grown by a factor of four over that

41:45.509 --> 41:55.260
decade.

41:55.340 --> 41:59.765
NSF funding has been decreasing slowly since 
1984. But overall,

41:59.885 --> 42:05.732
we've had a decade of almost unprecedented 
growth. And I think what's going to happen is that

42:11.441 --> 42:15.386
will just kind of tail off and stabilize. The 
problem is that what we're trying to do now is that

42:15.807 --> 42:24.580
the way astronomy developed, it needs photons. In 
order to get photons, you need large collecting

42:24.600 --> 42:31.571
area, and you have to use every photon you get 
efficiently. So we had this growth of... sort of

42:37.285 --> 42:48.904
three to four meter size telescopes

42:37.285 --> 42:48.904
in, I guess, 1960s, then in the early 70s. And then 
in the 1980s, what we've done is develop our

42:49.164 --> 42:56.456
ability to use the photons better. The 
instrumentation has been our focus. Well, if

42:59.122 --> 43:04.068
you're going to build a big telescope with a large 
collecting area, you're talking about a lot of

42:59.122 --> 43:04.068
bucks. If you're building more efficient 
instruments, that can be done a lot more cheaper.

43:09.355 --> 43:24.454
So a lot of our advances and ability to work on this 
kind of thing has been done rather cheaply in the

43:09.355 --> 43:24.454
1980s with the development of array detectors for 
infrared, CCD detectors, which are up to a hundred

43:25.058 --> 43:30.527
times more efficient than photographic plates 
for the visible region. Moving to new spectral

43:31.249 --> 43:41.526
regions, going out into space and riding on the 
coattails of the space program. Well now, those

43:41.546 --> 43:43.810
kinds of things advantages are all gone. In space, 
the missions are being charged to astronomy, so

43:46.519 --> 43:55.254
that the full costs have to be borne essentially by 
the science. And the ground, you've run out of

43:55.855 --> 43:59.841
improvements that you can make in the 
instrumentation. So in order to make further

43:59.881 --> 44:06.793
improvements and stretch farther back toward the 
beginning of time, you have to go bigger

44:06.925 --> 44:09.007
telescopes. And you're talking about big bucks. 
And so astronomy has come to a point where they have

44:11.149 --> 44:19.657
to spend big bucks now, just at a time where we 
geared up to do it. And we've spent some of them, as

44:20.017 --> 44:22.660
in the Hubble telescope. But now the continuation 
of the back to X-ray and infrared and the

44:23.360 --> 44:34.030
ground-based telescopes is requiring the 
expenditure of large amounts of money. And that's

44:38.571 --> 44:52.646
a difficult impasse we're at right now, to need 
these large projects to make further progress

44:38.571 --> 44:52.646
just at a time when the growth of astronomy is 
tailing off and probably going to decrease a

44:38.571 --> 44:52.646
little bit. Well, it's exactly a similar 
situation that prevails in planetary astronomy

44:52.666 --> 44:57.932
with probes. Well, I say this. I'm including the 
space missions. infrared and x-ray, but the same

45:03.811 --> 45:11.277
thing is true with the, you know, we're not going to 
get major Galileo missions anymore. But those are

45:12.040 --> 45:15.913
the kinds of missions that we really need to do the 
job right. A lot of people have been making a lot of,

45:16.602 --> 45:36.689
getting a lot of publicity, and I guess getting 
money to do research on topics of great practical

45:16.602 --> 45:36.689
importance to Joe Blow in the street, and I'm 
talking about things like watching out for killer

45:16.602 --> 45:36.689
asteroids in comets, search for 
extraterrestrial intelligence, studies of the

45:16.602 --> 45:36.689
ozone hole and everything. Well, this is all 
reasonable science, but do you think that that's

45:36.709 --> 45:42.817
kind of pushing it a little bit too much, or what? Or 
is it just get all the money you can doing whatever

45:42.917 --> 45:46.322
you want to do? Well, some of them are very 
important, like the ozone hole. We really have to

45:49.638 --> 45:59.491
understand, I mean, that's a long-term project 
that we have to start collecting data on as soon as

45:49.638 --> 45:59.491
we can. I think the amount of money spent on that is 
excessive, probably, because Congress saw that

45:59.511 --> 46:10.105
as something that should be solved. And so you 
solve things with money, and they don't

46:10.726 --> 46:13.710
understand... that it takes long and persistent 
effort to make progress. Same way with the war on

46:18.698 --> 46:20.281
cancer. They threw a lot of money at it because they 
were going to solve it, but they haven't made that

46:20.321 --> 46:27.392
much progress because the money was not wisely 
spent. And I am afraid that we might be in that same

46:27.412 --> 46:30.897
kind of thing with the ozone. But in terms of the 
search for extraterrestrial intelligence, I

46:31.598 --> 46:41.554
think there's a rationale for doing that right now 
if we really want to know and that is the tremendous

46:41.872 --> 46:50.159
growth in the use of the radio spectrum by 
terrestrial uses and services. If we don't search

46:50.600 --> 47:00.388
the microwave spectrum now, it'll essentially be 
blanked out because of all the local interference

46:50.600 --> 47:00.388
we're developing. So that's an important thing to 
do right now if we're going to make a really

47:00.448 --> 47:08.975
coherent search. We've never had a...
