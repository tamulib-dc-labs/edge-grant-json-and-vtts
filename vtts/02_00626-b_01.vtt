00:03.912 --> 00:24.035
It's been suggested that during this period, 
while you were at the Hydrographic Office, that

00:03.912 --> 00:24.035
research and development in oceanography was 
directed by or divided up, if I may use that word,

00:03.912 --> 00:24.035
between Ewing, Islin, and Revell, that they sort 
of are working a plotting, as it were, of expanding

00:03.912 --> 00:24.035
oceanography. Would you agree with that?

00:31.564 --> 00:33.126
You're talking... I'm talking about 46, 47, and 
48, when Scripps and Woods Hole and O&R began to

00:34.523 --> 00:45.698
think about what the future of oceanography is. 
Yes, I think that's probably a pretty fair

00:47.321 --> 00:53.769
statement. They certainly exerted a lot of 
influence in the Washington area.

01:04.004 --> 01:20.939
And

01:04.004 --> 01:20.939
I think it's hard in a way for

01:04.004 --> 01:20.939
me to recall too much what was happening at the 
institutions at that time, because I wasn't

01:04.004 --> 01:20.939
there. I wasn't in any of them. I was in Washington. 
And I think it was really to kind of stabilize after

01:24.389 --> 01:37.301
the war and get things on what we looked at as more or 
less stable footing. In other words, if I can. go

01:42.648 --> 01:45.312
off on a tangent here for a moment. I showed you this 
morning this book by Vaughan, which I have called

01:45.372 --> 02:08.065
NASCO I. NASCO is a term that came in later, but this 
was one of the early attempts

01:45.372 --> 02:08.065
of the National Academy of Sciences to look at the 
state of marine sciences in this country, which

02:08.382 --> 02:20.322
occurred in the 1920s, although that book of bonds 
was not published until essentially 10 years

02:08.382 --> 02:20.322
later. But there was another National Academy 
committee set up at about the time you're talking

02:21.103 --> 02:32.803
about, and I can't remember it exactly, at which 
Scripps, Woods Hole, and so on were asked

02:33.560 --> 03:02.942
essentially what they thought they wanted to do, 
and I can't recall any of the content, but there is a

02:33.560 --> 03:02.942
small publication resulting from that 
committee, and the only part of it I can recall at

02:33.560 --> 03:02.942
all is that Professor Thompson, who was then 
director of what were known as the Oceanographic

02:33.560 --> 03:02.942
Laboratories at the University of Washington, 
his chief emphasis that he just wanted to return to

03:03.462 --> 03:12.492
the pre-war status, which I thought was 
singularly unimaginative, as I remember. But

03:13.154 --> 03:16.324
yes, I think that It was pretty much dominated by 
Woods Hole scripts, and then Lamont came on the

03:17.333 --> 03:24.901
scene, I guess, about that time. And then there was 
this flurry of establishment of essentially new

03:25.522 --> 03:33.090
laboratories.

03:34.691 --> 03:42.780
Chesapeake Bay Institute, Texas A&M in 
particular come to mind here, and there were

03:34.691 --> 03:42.780
several others as I recall. What sort of fellow was 
Islin? What was he like? Well, I think I, although I

03:47.742 --> 04:07.540
was never sort of spent very much time at Woods Hole 
and so on, apparently I knew more about him than a

03:47.742 --> 04:07.540
lot of his people that more or less lived with him. 
in that he was very much sort of a lone wolf in a way,

04:08.144 --> 04:32.700
although he was quite outgoing in meetings and 
conferences and so on, his private life was

04:08.144 --> 04:32.700
something which was very much his own, and he lived 
on Martha's Vineyard and later on near Boston, I

04:08.144 --> 04:32.700
think it was in Newton, I'm one of the few people 
who's ever been a house guest at the Eastlands, as

04:33.406 --> 04:39.755
far as I know. And I don't know quite why. But

04:40.997 --> 05:02.788
he was a real sort of a puzzle to me, in a way, because 
he was

04:40.997 --> 05:02.788
very imaginative in many ways, and very 
farsighted in looking ahead and so on. In fact, I

05:03.477 --> 05:20.912
was just thinking the other day that some of the 
things he said to me at the time I thought were silly

05:03.477 --> 05:20.912
and which I now look back on and see that he was just 
about 10 or 20 years ahead of anybody else and

05:03.477 --> 05:20.912
things. However, I always felt that he was

05:25.803 --> 05:41.922
in a sense anti-intellectual, which sounds kind 
of snobbish here, but his own background was only,

05:25.803 --> 05:41.922
I think, up to the level of a bachelor's degree, and 
his degree, I think, was actually in

05:25.803 --> 05:41.922
anthropology. In other words, he didn't have a 
very strong sort of scientific background on

05:42.002 --> 05:51.473
which to build, and he tended to look for similar 
types of people in many cases who were interested,

05:52.297 --> 06:08.934
but I would consider, in a sense, not 
scientifically qualified. Now, he made me a liar

06:09.014 --> 06:18.523
in a number of cases here in that some of these 
people that he had joined Woods Hole, an

06:20.174 --> 06:31.128
organization that turned out to be very 
outstanding, but I would venture that the sort of

06:20.174 --> 06:31.128
general average was not too good. And one of the 
great deficiencies I felt at Woods Hole was that

06:31.768 --> 06:48.409
they never sincerely sought, I'm talking of the 
era when Islin was there, but it tended to carry on

06:31.768 --> 06:48.409
after he'd retired, was that they never really 
supported an educational program either at Woods

06:48.659 --> 06:53.968
Hole or anywhere else. They were very, very much 
out of research oriented here. And it was only when

06:58.736 --> 07:10.617
the, I think it was Admiral Smith in particular, 
later on saw certain advantages which could be

07:10.968 --> 07:16.937
achieved in terms of money by becoming an 
educational institution. They sort of switched

07:16.997 --> 07:21.624
in that direction, but I don't think they've ever 
really taken it very seriously. That's my sort of

07:21.684 --> 07:33.162
point here.

07:35.504 --> 07:40.311
I asked Columbus one day, how do you recruit your 
people? And he said, oh, I don't worry about that. I

07:42.555 --> 07:45.860
have enough nice young men come knocking on my 
door. I never have to go looking for people.

07:50.908 --> 07:53.792
And I think this was true in many cases. They were 
nice young men, in the best sense of the word. What

07:59.541 --> 08:00.583
about Yuli? Oh, Ewing is an entrepreneur, 
obviously, and very aggressive, very different,

08:00.952 --> 08:29.592
and entirely different from Islin, with a very

08:00.952 --> 08:29.592
tremendously hard working, and

08:00.952 --> 08:29.592
broadly interested, and

08:00.952 --> 08:29.592
very much the entrepreneur, as I said, capable of 
interesting people, raising money, getting

08:29.993 --> 08:38.146
things going, and so on. I think with a good eye in 
most cases for people that he hired to work with

08:38.307 --> 08:55.495
him, the main

08:38.307 --> 08:55.495
sort of reservation I have about Ewing, as I used to 
identify him, he was a cream skimmer. He'd get an

09:02.051 --> 09:19.423
idea, do enough work on it to sort of meet his 
particular interest at the moment, sometimes

09:02.051 --> 09:19.423
correctly, sometimes I think misinterpreting 
things, and then he'd move on to something else and

09:02.051 --> 09:19.423
leave it to other people to kind of come along and 
clean up sometimes the mess I think he left behind

09:19.876 --> 09:28.806
him in the sense. But I think we can, in a field such 
as this, we can always, I'm sure, consider

09:30.248 --> 09:38.897
ourselves fortunate to have some people like 
that. We don't want everybody to be Morris Ewing.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.303
That same charge has been leveled against Revell. 
Would you agree with that? Well, Ravel has

09:46.083 --> 10:08.648
switched around a great deal, and

09:46.083 --> 10:08.648
yet I think, again, it's hard to make offhand. kind 
of judgments and evaluations, but his interests

10:09.033 --> 10:30.113
were clearly much broader than Ewing's, and I 
think it's fair to say that Ravel had, in a sense, an

10:09.033 --> 10:30.113
altruistic interest in many of these things, 
although they redounded to his glory in a way, but I

10:30.481 --> 10:46.922
think Ewing's concerns were always, as things 
affected Ewing, and I can't imagine Ewing getting

10:30.481 --> 10:46.922
involved in these programs in India and so on. 
Pakistan has rebelled it, or Ewing going

10:46.942 --> 10:58.497
to Harvard has rebelled it and entering an 
entirely new sort of field here. And so there's

10:59.708 --> 11:04.684
really some very major differences, I think, 
between them.

11:07.794 --> 11:09.921
It's almost as if in let's say about 48 or 49, right 
before you decide to come to Washington, it's

11:10.643 --> 11:22.123
almost as if the ONR says, look, there's not enough 
oceanographers to suit the needs. And what we've

11:22.183 --> 11:30.518
got to do is move out and not only establish 
departments of oceanography, but establish

11:22.183 --> 11:30.518
particular kinds of departments of 
oceanography. We need, for example, chemical

11:31.740 --> 11:34.525
oceanographers. Where should that be, and what 
should it be? We need people to work on the Gulf

11:37.105 --> 11:40.610
Coast, and what should they do, and what should 
they be? Would you agree with that? Yes, I think I

11:42.492 --> 12:04.022
haven't thought about these things for so long, 
and dates and events and so on are getting

11:42.492 --> 12:04.022
confused, but there was this

11:42.492 --> 12:04.022
sort of regionalism, yes, that we ought to spot. 
places in appropriate coastal regions, and there

12:04.576 --> 12:15.736
was nothing in the Gulf area, Gulf of Mexico, and so 
on. And then this Chesapeake Bay development came

12:16.678 --> 12:26.736
up, which was really, I think, possibly brought 
into being as much as anything else, but the fact

12:27.745 --> 12:43.299
that ONR was willing to put some money into it, 
although it was, as I recall, sort of a tripartite

12:27.745 --> 12:43.299
arrangement at first of Maryland, Virginia, and 
ONR. And that was thought of as a center for sort of

12:44.481 --> 12:51.607
looking at large bays and estuaries. And so it was 
partly regional, partly sort of subject matter. I

12:57.698 --> 13:19.894
don't really recall any

12:57.698 --> 13:19.894
strong impetus really towards sort of training 
programs, although they obviously came along

12:57.698 --> 13:19.894
with this in a way. ONR is always in the rather 
difficult position that they were not supposed to

13:23.703 --> 13:39.043
support education as such, and so it was often 
done, but it was budgeted for in essentially other

13:23.703 --> 13:39.043
terms here.

13:41.927 --> 13:51.820
They certainly wanted to help here, and the

13:53.555 --> 14:19.275
Dr. Thompson was the director of what were then 
known as the Oceanographic Laboratories, which

13:53.555 --> 14:19.275
had existed since about 1930 when the Rockefeller 
money was available and the laboratories were set

13:53.555 --> 14:19.275
up, and there was some teaching prior to the war, 
some local sort of work at sea with a very small

14:19.660 --> 14:31.572
vessel which was actually sold by the university 
during the war, so there was no vessel left here.

14:31.592 --> 14:47.389
When Dr. Thompson came back to the university 
after the war, he had a commission in the chemical

14:31.592 --> 14:47.389
warfare branch of the Army. He tried to pick up the 
pieces and sort of reestablish a program here and

14:47.740 --> 14:59.814
found it very difficult because a lot of the people 
had moved away or died or got other interests.

14:59.834 --> 15:01.696
There was no vessel here and so on. So he was really 
faced with a real problem and the first thing that

15:02.437 --> 15:16.093
essentially ONR did here was provide a little 
money to essentially to get a small vessel going

15:16.445 --> 15:30.808
again and to support a few people and,

15:16.445 --> 15:30.808
you know, as I indicated a while ago, kind of get it 
going a little bit as it had been ten years

15:31.312 --> 15:58.236
previously, and so when I came out here, ONR 
support was about $100,000 a year, and that was

15:31.312 --> 15:58.236
essentially the only support available, and it 
was available on a, it was really a kind of block

15:31.312 --> 15:58.236
funding, and it was out of this we began to develop 
the programs here. So, Yes, I think it was a

16:00.387 --> 16:08.021
deliberate effort of ONR to try and proliferate.

16:09.123 --> 16:25.011
But I think in many cases, if the availability

16:09.123 --> 16:25.011
of funds for some of these newer institutions and 
trying to get the University of Washington back in

16:09.123 --> 16:25.011
business again, was essentially as long as it 
didn't interfere too much with the funding of

16:25.514 --> 16:37.636
Scripps and Woods Hole, which may sound like sour 
grapes, but I think that in a way this was a sort of

16:25.514 --> 16:37.636
situation. Who made contact with you to come out 
here? I don't know exactly what happened, but the

16:41.596 --> 16:58.595
man on the faculty or in the administration here 
who contacted me was the dean of the College of Arts

16:41.596 --> 16:58.595
and Sciences, Dean Lloyd Woodburn. And

16:58.615 --> 17:10.067
I don't know whether I'd been suggested by Tommy 
Thompson or just have,

17:11.060 --> 17:27.139
They had realized, and I think this is sort of worth 
noting, that they couldn't go back to the kind of

17:11.060 --> 17:27.139
pre-war operations, that something had to be done 
here that would change the thing. And in the spring

17:27.439 --> 17:33.827
of 1951, the Board of Regents, which is our 
governing body, decided, I'm sure it was on the

17:33.993 --> 18:00.895
recommendation of Dean Woodburn, to create a 
Department of Oceanography in the College of Arts

17:33.993 --> 18:00.895
and Sciences, which then just changed the 
emphasis away from a sort of a research activity

17:33.993 --> 18:00.895
towards an educational activity and made it an 
undergraduate as well as graduate education.

18:06.731 --> 18:21.745
There were two sort of separate entities here at 
the university which had been operated before the

18:06.731 --> 18:21.745
war and had returned to this sort of situation 
after the war.

18:25.508 --> 18:32.535
Both of them operated under this general title of 
the Oceanographic Laboratories, plural. One was

18:34.017 --> 18:53.464
a facility at the Friday Harbor on the San Juan 
Islands, which is a field station type thing, and

18:34.017 --> 18:53.464
the building that had been erected on the main 
campus here, which, with Rockville money, which

18:34.017 --> 18:53.464
you have to go and have a look at while you're here. 
It's hidden by this other edifice here now. These

18:57.469 --> 19:01.054
two things were operated jointly. under 
Professor Thompson, and when I came out here, the

19:01.507 --> 19:22.992
assumption was that I would operate both of them, 
but for a variety of reasons, it seemed much better

19:01.507 --> 19:22.992
to me to operate them separately, but I was not 
only, I was called executive officer of the

19:23.258 --> 19:48.186
Department of Oceanography and director of the 
Friday Harbor Laboratories, and I had these two

19:23.258 --> 19:48.186
jobs in effect for some seven years, I think it was, 
and then someone else took over as director at the

19:23.258 --> 19:48.186
Friday Harbor Laboratories, but I had the dual 
sort of jobs here. mentioned earlier, I got into

19:48.841 --> 19:57.232
sort of administration of one kind during the war, 
administration of kind of another kind in

19:48.841 --> 19:57.232
Washington. I came out here and I got into still 
another kind of administration. So in many

20:02.879 --> 20:07.445
respects, I haven't been a research scientist for 
a long, long time here. And it was more by accident

20:07.946 --> 20:13.633
than I think by choice. When you came to the West to 
visit the dean, what did he tell you about the

20:15.267 --> 20:22.594
Department of Oceanography he wanted you to 
found? Oh, I think that

20:22.615 --> 20:42.675
I had fairly

20:22.615 --> 20:42.675
strong ideas at that time about what I thought I 
wanted to do, and part of it had come out of some

20:43.263 --> 21:01.374
deliberations that had gone on, and I can't really 
remember at the moment who prompted them, whether

20:43.263 --> 21:01.374
it was ONR or some other agency. We'd had a number of 
meetings on essentially education in

21:01.794 --> 21:09.287
oceanography, and there was a paper was finally 
published, and I think it was in Science, if I

21:09.638 --> 21:25.098
remember correctly, by Redfield and I think 
Revell and several others, sort of setting out

21:09.638 --> 21:25.098
what they felt the curriculum in oceanography 
ought to be. And this was part of what I sort of had in

21:25.118 --> 21:29.984
mind when I came out here. In other words, I wasn't 
operating entirely on my own hunches here. There

21:36.091 --> 21:37.333
was some agreement in a sense as to what might be 
done now that what was different here was the

21:37.499 --> 22:05.920
opportunity to get into the undergraduate 
program and this it took us about a year I think to

21:37.499 --> 22:05.920
develop a sort of program of courses and so forth 
that we thought we could start with. And

22:07.788 --> 22:18.059
we had our first students, I guess, in about 1952. 
Now, this

22:18.079 --> 22:26.649
is in effect now the first institution of 
undergraduate oceanography in the country, and

22:18.079 --> 22:26.649
possibly in the world. So what sort of students did 
you look for?

22:33.929 --> 22:43.161
Well, I don't know whether we looked for a 
particular kind of students, because students

22:33.929 --> 22:43.161
kind of come to you in a case like this. What we felt, 
and I think correctly, was that we were offering

22:44.242 --> 22:55.417
them a sort of an interesting field. But more 
particularly, an opportunity for students.

23:01.418 --> 23:11.395
obviously is science-oriented, and in a sense 
here, basically science-oriented, a basic

23:01.418 --> 23:11.395
science orientation.

23:14.210 --> 23:21.981
A field where the student could be a kind of a 
scientific generalist rather than a specialist.

23:23.023 --> 23:32.016
And I've always felt that way and I feel it even more 
so today that I'm not saying it's the kind of

23:23.023 --> 23:32.016
program that should be available for for 
everybody, or it really shouldn't displace the

23:32.485 --> 23:39.177
kind of specialist programs. But I think there 
should be opportunities at all levels for

23:39.257 --> 23:51.038
students who have an inclination towards being 
broad and being generalists,

23:39.257 --> 23:51.038
interdisciplinary, and these various other 
terms that are used. There should be some

23:51.299 --> 23:53.262
opportunities for that. And this is essentially 
what we started out with this in mind. The other

23:59.887 --> 24:17.904
sort of things we had in mind was to prepare people 
really for jobs in agencies such as hydrographic

23:59.887 --> 24:17.904
office and other government and state agencies 
who needed people. The other institutions at that

24:19.126 --> 24:21.628
time were all post-graduate, and really all they 
were interested in were doctoral people, so they

24:22.553 --> 24:48.207
were training all the generals, but they didn't 
have any Indians to go along with them, and I felt

24:22.553 --> 24:48.207
that, not very glamorous, but certainly a need 
that I thought we could meet, and I think we did

24:22.553 --> 24:48.207
fairly well. The original sort of concept was that 
all the students would go through a similar sort of

24:48.912 --> 25:16.135
curriculum, but this only lasted for a relatively 
few years, and then we began increasing in

24:48.912 --> 25:16.135
numbers, and the research program increased, and 
there were more faculty, and so forth, and I found I

24:48.912 --> 25:16.135
was essentially fighting a losing battle here, 
because all of the the options, as we used to call

25:16.891 --> 25:33.369
them in the department, physical, chemical, 
biological, geological, and somewhat more

25:16.891 --> 25:33.369
recently geophysical, all wanted to have their 
own sort of programs. So this idea of a kind of a

25:33.890 --> 25:41.278
basic common undergraduate preparation gave way 
to again, more specialized optional programs in

25:41.613 --> 25:48.061
these sort of five fields. And I got sort of out of 
sorts with this as the years went by. I think

25:54.549 --> 26:04.301
there's a swing in the other direction now, and 
they're beginning to feel that maybe there is some

25:54.549 --> 26:04.301
merit to having people with sort of broad training 
again. But it's taken 20 years or so for the

26:04.461 --> 26:11.029
pendulum to swing, and it hasn't moved very far. 
that direction. When you started choosing

26:12.898 --> 26:16.022
faculty, what sort of faculty did you look for? 
Well, this is more or less, you know, kind of

26:17.004 --> 26:22.713
parallel to the students. There was no one to look 
for, and

26:22.793 --> 26:32.528
we had

26:34.448 --> 26:58.331
When I came out here, Professor Thompson, who was a 
chemist and a chemical oceanographer, Cliff

26:34.448 --> 26:58.331
Barnes, who was originally a chemist but more so a 
physical oceanographer, Morris Rattray, who had

26:34.448 --> 26:58.331
come in just finishing his PhD from Caltech, who 
was a theoretical hydrodynamicist, and myself. I

26:59.472 --> 27:01.114
think that was about it. We had really nobody in the 
geological area, nobody in the biological area,

27:01.685 --> 27:18.160
and so part of my job was to obviously try and find 
some people in these two sort of fields. And it

27:18.180 --> 27:28.570
turned out to be just as hard as it had been during 
the war and back in the Hydrographic Office to find

27:18.180 --> 27:28.570
anybody to go into these areas. And

27:30.355 --> 27:51.435
the first geological oceanographer I was able to 
add to the faculty was Howard Gould, who's now and

27:30.355 --> 27:51.435
has been for a number of years with the Humboldt 
research laboratories in Houston. That's right.

27:56.558 --> 28:04.249
And he spent several years with us and then felt he 
wanted more money and so on, so he went to Humble.

28:05.270 --> 28:14.022
And the next geologist I recruited was Joe Krager, 
who was a brand new PhD out of Texas A&M. He was one of

28:14.063 --> 28:17.948
the very first of the PhDs. But these people had 
very little sort of experience themselves. I

28:23.542 --> 28:30.050
mean, they were, as the most recent PhDs, and they 
had to, in a sense, learn a lot on the job here. Not as

28:30.471 --> 28:47.393
far as this sort of research, I'm not saying that, 
but from a teaching point of view, the biologist

28:30.471 --> 28:47.393
turned out to be almost equally hard to find 
anybody who had, who was not strictly a sort of a

28:30.471 --> 28:47.393
biologist, but had some of the interests of what I 
would identify as a biological oceanographer,

28:48.048 --> 28:55.857
which meant some other background. And

28:55.997 --> 29:03.907
this turned out to be, as I say, just as hard to find 
anybody there. And this has more or less

29:05.128 --> 29:13.718
persisted, I think, even up to today. One of the 
things that strikes me all the time is that you can

29:14.508 --> 29:35.200
clearly find research people these days, often, 
however, with really very narrow kind of

29:14.508 --> 29:35.200
preparation, but very few of them with any kind of 
teaching experience. may be one of our

29:35.602 --> 29:54.808
contributions here has been the fact that an awful 
lot of graduate students have been teaching

29:35.602 --> 29:54.808
assistants here, a kind of experience they never 
got in any of the other places, and do go out of here,

29:35.602 --> 29:54.808
not all of them, but a good many of them, with some 
kind of feeling about what the teaching job is. How

29:56.831 --> 29:57.812
are you doing?
