1234 1234 1234

00:36.515 --> 00:55.200
This is May 6th, I believe, and sitting in the very 
quiet and pleasant living room with Barney Welch

00:36.515 --> 00:55.200
and chatting with him about his years in College 
Station.

00:56.903 --> 01:03.872
For someone who might listen to this or read it some 
years in the future and who might not know you, Give

01:05.033 --> 01:11.301
a brief summary of your background before you came 
to A&M to be employed. Where'd you grow up? I was

01:13.444 --> 01:17.168
born in Eichel, Texas, September 3, 1922. I moved 
from there at about three years old to Cleburne. My

01:23.236 --> 01:25.158
father worked for J.C. Penney's. This was in the 
middle of the 20s, right before the Depression

01:25.759 --> 01:30.585
hit. The Depression came. My dad moved to 
Stephenville, Texas, where I grew up. I went to

01:37.613 --> 01:39.375
high school in Stephenville. I was graduated at 
midterm, and I was not going to school until the

01:40.516 --> 01:47.424
fall. I had a football scholarship to Rice 
University. I didn't know anything about Rice. I

01:54.912 --> 01:57.214
went to Houston and worked for Hughes Tools. I was 
doing what they call parking lots. They had split

02:01.390 --> 02:09.621
shifts in those days, and I would go out at 3 o'clock 
in the afternoon and park several hundred cars or

02:01.390 --> 02:09.621
direct parking in at night. And I stayed there 
three or four months, and I got awfully homesick

02:10.322 --> 02:17.513
because I had never been away from home that far. 
And one time I decided to see if I could leave, and I

02:19.235 --> 02:26.526
called a friend of mine named Darius Mosier at A&M 
who was a football player. And I said, Darius, I

02:27.637 --> 02:30.140
don't like it down here. And he said, well, get your 
butt up to East Texas. So I went to Overton, Texas,

02:35.064 --> 02:46.356
and went to work for a man named Bert Fox, who was a 
class of 22, I think, who was doing almost all the

02:35.064 --> 02:46.356
work in those days. Actually, we lived in New 
London, where they had a terrible explosion in

02:46.376 --> 02:52.542
1937. So I stayed there until... school and then I 
came down to Texas A&M. Alright, but keep going

02:59.736 --> 03:06.084
until you come here to be a... Oh, employee. Okay, I 
came in 1941. I came on the scholarship here. We

03:10.590 --> 03:22.084
played in 41 and 42 and then all the basically fit 
sophomores were inducted as privates into the

03:10.590 --> 03:22.084
Army. They had told us that Being as we had two years 
of ROTC, we were chosen men, so we conducted as

03:24.269 --> 03:30.595
private and infantry. And I left A&M in June of 43 
and went to Camp Maxey, Texas, which is in Paris,

03:32.116 --> 03:39.584
Texas. We were up there, took our basic training. 
There were kids from what they called the 8th Corps

03:42.206 --> 03:46.690
area. It was Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, 
Louisiana, and I don't know why. We stayed there,

03:54.374 --> 04:10.992
took our basic, and then the Army said, we don't 
need all these guys right now, so they established

03:54.374 --> 04:10.992
what was called the ASTP, Army Reserve Training 
Program, Army Specialized Training Program. So

04:11.012 --> 04:19.441
my group, about 300 or 400 of us, went to Commerce, 
Texas, and were learning and taking engineering,

04:11.012 --> 04:19.441
which I had not had. I had been at ECO at A&M. But I got 
some awfully good instruction, and we stayed

04:21.678 --> 04:27.246
there for several months, about four or five 
months. Then the Army, the federal government

04:27.266 --> 04:43.089
decided they needed us, so we went back to Camp 
Maxey, took our training, and then shipped out to

04:27.266 --> 04:43.089
Europe in the infantry, where I spent about 30 
months over there. I was in the 99th Infantry

04:43.169 --> 04:46.234
Division. I served in three different battles. 
including Battle of the Balls and Remagen Bridge

04:49.505 --> 04:52.948
and some others. After the war, in Europe, the way 
you came home was by points. You had to have so many

04:59.275 --> 05:00.275
points. If you were married, you had so many. If you 
were so many months in service. I happened to be

05:06.061 --> 05:06.982
married. I had married just before I left to go into 
service. But I had about nine months to spend in

05:10.966 --> 05:16.391
Europe. And Patton happened to come through my 
division one time and didn't think the military

05:18.665 --> 05:30.417
courtesy was good enough, so he sent a regiment of 
us down to Nuremberg, Germany, where the war

05:18.665 --> 05:30.417
tribunals were going to be held. At that time, I had 
been transferred from the 99th to Big Red One,

05:30.457 --> 05:35.982
first in condition. And we had 10,000 SS troopers 
under a stalag about six kilometers outside of

05:36.002 --> 05:47.153
Nuremberg, and every morning we would take all 
those guys into Nuremberg, put 15, two and a half

05:47.909 --> 05:59.162
ton truck, would have guards in the front and back, 
and they would spend the day cleaning up the debris

05:47.909 --> 05:59.162
that Nuremberg had suffered when we actually 
fought in Nuremberg. What happened, we couldn't

05:59.182 --> 06:06.210
take Nuremberg, so somebody pulled us back and 
they bombed it and shelled it real heavy. But then,

06:06.991 --> 06:16.802
after that, I came home and I shipped out of 
Marseille, France, Christmas Eve, 1945, and was

06:17.491 --> 06:20.954
discharged at Tyler, Texas in 1946. And that was 
January, so I still had some time before I got back

06:22.436 --> 06:33.547
to A&M, and I worked just during day labor there at 
Stephenville until we came back to A&M in 1946. All

06:33.567 --> 06:36.930
right, and then you came as a student, graduated. I 
came back as a junior. At that time, there were no

06:38.972 --> 06:45.979
motels, no hotels, except on the campus that had 
one was called Aggieland Inn? Aggieland Inn,

06:47.281 --> 06:48.162
yeah. Well, a guy named Pinky Downs, who's quite a 
famous Aggie, who at that time was the ticket agent

06:48.702 --> 06:59.313
for the football, I mean, athletic department. He 
got me an apartment in Bryan. My wife and I had a

07:01.695 --> 07:03.797
little boy that was three years old. We lived there 
for a few months, and then I moved to a place called

07:04.718 --> 07:09.283
Blue Top Courts out to Eastgate. And we stayed 
there for... several months, and then Mr.

07:13.162 --> 07:32.272
Gilchrist, who was president, bought a bunch of 
army barracks from Victoria, Texas, moved them up

07:13.162 --> 07:32.272
here a little bit north of the campus called 
College View, and as we finished one, it let some

07:13.162 --> 07:32.272
people move in. You moved in according to your day 
of graduation, and they took each one of these

07:32.312 --> 07:40.004
barracks and made four apartments of it. They had a 
little with two little bedrooms, a living and

07:41.073 --> 07:45.878
dining room, and a little kitchen. And we moved 
into there, paying $28 a month. And there was lots

07:52.786 --> 07:53.727
of us. We were all in the same boat. Nobody had any 
money. We had about $90 a month from the GI Bill. And

08:00.375 --> 08:03.558
because I was on scholarships, I was better than 
most of them. And we lived there. And I went ahead

08:05.360 --> 08:07.603
and played two more years of ball. One summer, the 
last year that I was in school, I was up in Pine

08:09.035 --> 08:22.789
intramurals softball for a guy named Spike White, 
who at that time was director of student

08:09.035 --> 08:22.789
activities under Mr. Pemberton. He was dean of 
men. And Spike asked me, when I was about to

08:24.230 --> 08:37.523
graduate and make terms, I'd be interested in 
taking over the intramural department, which he

08:24.230 --> 08:37.523
had until he moved up to director of student 
activities. 27, I guess, then, and had a child and

08:37.891 --> 08:41.875
jumped at that. And I had the opportunity to play 
pro ball, but I didn't think I could make it because

08:41.895 --> 08:47.081
I'd been at it too long. I didn't think I was good 
enough first place. All right, so you go on the

08:49.003 --> 08:52.727
payroll then as a full-time employee. And when was 
that, 47? That was January, no, January of 48. 48.

08:58.814 --> 09:00.576
And do you remember what your starting pay was? 
$2,400. $2,400 for 12 months. 12 months. And in

09:04.705 --> 09:09.851
general, describe your duties as director of 
intramural. Well, for the people who do not know,

09:09.871 --> 09:13.455
intramural means within, of course. And this was a 
program that was strictly for the students. At

09:18.021 --> 09:21.865
that time, they were all boys here, and there was 
nothing else in this community. There was no night

09:21.885 --> 09:25.149
clubs, no eating places, no girls. There was 
nothing for these jokers to do. So we had a very

09:27.832 --> 09:29.875
strong intramural program. We had, at that time, 
the core outfits. A infantry would play B infantry

09:32.296 --> 09:35.699
and so forth and so forth. And we had about, oh, I 
don't know, 30, 40 sports they could participate

09:35.719 --> 09:44.828
in, like football and basketball and horseshoes 
and tennis and all that stuff. And that was my

09:44.848 --> 09:50.734
responsibility to oversee that program, to 
schedule it, to direct it. I didn't have any help,

09:50.754 --> 09:53.276
and that was Secretary didn't have anything. Of 
course, we even saved old nails out of boards to use

09:53.296 --> 09:58.481
them on. The only money we got was from that. from 
the exchange store money. We had an exchange

10:04.168 --> 10:05.510
store, as you know. And they declared profits each 
year, and they supported a lot of student

10:06.531 --> 10:11.037
activities. And intramurals got, I don't 
remember, like $70,000, $80,000 a year, maybe a

10:11.598 --> 10:17.986
little bit more to operate that program. That's 
probably what it was. All right, and where did

10:19.088 --> 10:24.895
intramural games and contests largely take 
place? On the campus. No, but where? Physically.

10:27.951 --> 10:28.392
Okay. Behind Duncan Messall, which is now called 
Duncan Drillfield, we had softball fields there.

10:35.822 --> 10:42.893
The basketball was at the Grove, and we used some of 
D-wear when we could get in. After they built G.

10:43.854 --> 10:47.259
Roddy White, we used part of it upstairs there. The 
rifle was under the stadium. Softball was on the

10:50.383 --> 10:52.827
field, as I said. We had a football, we had five 
football fields south of Kyle Field that were

10:53.228 --> 10:57.532
strictly intramurals. There hadn't been parking 
for football, but we finally got to put a chain

10:57.552 --> 11:05.519
around it so we could keep it nice and clean and so 
forth. Were there any sports that y'all included

11:06.079 --> 11:12.885
that today would be considered a little unusual? 
Like y'all didn't play field hockey, you didn't

11:14.867 --> 11:21.733
play... No, we didn't play hockey, we didn't play 
any of those, what we call, we didn't play soccer.

11:22.675 --> 11:24.739
It was the thing that we played in high school. And 
didn't play horseshoes. We did horseshoes. Oh,

11:27.404 --> 11:28.205
you did horseshoes. We had a great horseshoe 
program. And we had a bowling program once the MSC

11:30.028 --> 11:32.693
was built. We had a ping pong program. We had golf. 
Polo was gone. Polo was gone. That was when I was a

11:38.444 --> 11:39.806
sophomore. And do you have any idea how many 
students... participated in interviews. At that

11:46.209 --> 11:56.880
time, after the war, when I left here in 43, I think, 
when I came back, it was terrible. We had 9,000

11:56.940 --> 11:58.262
kids. Now, they weren't all core. We had two 
programs there. Then we had the military and what

12:01.766 --> 12:05.530
we called the non-reg, the civilians. And the 
civilians played, but they were not as

12:06.190 --> 12:10.435
competitive or as... intent as the Corps was, in 
order to get the George Moore flag, which is the top

12:11.005 --> 12:19.659
board you can get at Texas A&M, you had to have some 
intramural points. So they really played, not

12:19.679 --> 12:29.814
only they played intramural because they liked 
it, because they were young and they enjoyed

12:19.679 --> 12:29.814
working out, plus there was nothing else to do, 
they also wanted some George Moore. Does that

12:29.834 --> 12:32.418
trophy go way back? Well, I understand George 
Moore was at Corregidor getting more. Oh, so... So

12:39.247 --> 12:41.449
he must have been back in... But where the trophy 
came from, it was here when I got here. Okay. And was

12:44.874 --> 12:46.095
there... I've heard that there was a great deal of 
prestige connected with winning that trophy. Oh,

12:51.642 --> 12:52.143
very much. We made a big deal out of it. Was there any 
outfit that was regularly the winner? The

12:58.211 --> 13:00.354
infantry won it eight years ago. Infantry won it? 
Well, just for eight years, I know. Why? What did

13:04.699 --> 13:05.240
they do? They wouldn't recruit. Mm-hmm. Now I 
don't know if you remember, or you know about it,

13:07.081 --> 13:14.048
whoever's going to hear this, but Hazen was 
terribly bad after we came back after the war.

13:14.068 --> 13:15.270
Really got terribly bad. Mainly because the kids 
were, they hadn't gone through it themselves and

13:15.990 --> 13:21.576
they didn't know what it was all about. It got so bad 
that the kids were moved to Annex, remember? So

13:25.760 --> 13:29.384
they had their own, we had our own separate program 
for them out there. So some of the units on campus

13:29.845 --> 13:33.088
would go recruit These kids out there, it's like 
you're doing football. And they find the athletes

13:36.498 --> 13:38.561
and they bring them in. Well, they actually just 
worked that hard the rest of them did. I see. Did

13:42.605 --> 13:46.630
you, were you responsible for the intramurals out 
at the annex? Yes, but a guy named Luke Harrison

13:46.650 --> 13:49.333
took care of it. I think he was, you know Luke. He 
kind of ran them, but it all came under my program.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.743
But I didn't actually go out there like I did on the 
campus. All right, now these folks that you

13:58.763 --> 14:02.788
mentioned, Spike White, describe him. Okay, he's 
probably the best friend I ever had. His boss was a

14:08.413 --> 14:11.296
guy named Penberthy. Yes, yes. Mr. Penberthy at 
that time was the most loved man probably ever on

14:12.177 --> 14:16.302
this campus. He came here in 1924, I think, from 
Ohio State, and he started the intramural program

14:16.342 --> 14:25.233
and the physical education program and ran it. 
About 1937, Spike was graduating from A&M, and he

14:30.157 --> 14:35.542
He was an electrical engineer and worked in 
Dallas, Texas, but he didn't like that. He wanted

14:35.563 --> 14:36.824
to be in the recreation. So he came back and got a 
degree in recreation at Mr. Penberthy. Asked him

14:43.030 --> 14:45.833
to take over the annual program, which he did. Then 
Mike went to the Navy during the war. And then when

14:49.757 --> 14:57.405
he came back, before the war, we did not have a dean 
of men here at Texas A&M commanding everything.

14:57.425 --> 14:59.607
There was a guy named... Who was the first one? Went 
on to East Texas to coach football. I don't know.

15:08.973 --> 15:10.035
I'll come back. We had one man who was made dean of 
men, but he had had a run-in with one of the board of

15:10.055 --> 15:19.609
regents early, back in the early years, and they 
got rid of him. And I can't thank Samuel O'Neill. So

15:21.352 --> 15:29.003
then they asked Mr. Penberthy to become dean of 
men, and it's my understanding that Mr. Gilchrist

15:21.352 --> 15:29.003
and some others asked begged him or encouraged him 
not to take it. When he was dean of men, he had

15:33.033 --> 15:39.821
responsibility for all the discipline but no 
control over the Corps. So he became the bad guy.

15:41.303 --> 15:42.745
He's one that had to kick him out of school. And 
going from the greatest man that probably ever

15:42.805 --> 15:49.854
came to Texas at that time, he became one of the most 
disliked. He was even ridiculed in the battalion,

15:49.874 --> 15:57.403
which is under his role in being this guy. But 
anyway, Spike was the guy that built up the golf

15:58.649 --> 16:04.836
course here at Texas A&M. Spike built the rodeo 
arena, which is now where Olsen Field is. Spike

16:11.023 --> 16:19.512
really built up all the dances, the graduations, 
all that stuff with understudent activities. He,

16:19.532 --> 16:22.535
well, I don't know. He was one of the finest men. He 
was one of the finest men, I guess I would say. But he

16:27.657 --> 16:42.171
later, what he's really done since then, he bought 
a boys camp in Branson, Missouri in 1954 called

16:27.657 --> 16:42.171
Candy Cup Camp for Boys, which had originally 
belonged to Dope Walker's father in the 1920s.

16:42.791 --> 16:43.152
Really? Dope Walker's daddy would take kids from 
Dallas down there. We're talking about his money.

16:47.476 --> 16:49.338
Take them down there and work out. Then a man named 
Bill Lance, who was a track coach at Tulsa Central,

16:49.478 --> 16:54.483
took it over. Mm-hmm. And Spike bought it in 54. 
Well, in 55, my wife and I went up there with Spike.

17:03.093 --> 17:06.599
We had 60 boys, and we kept them for eight weeks. We 
had little boys. We had captains one through 12. We

17:09.944 --> 17:11.206
kept them for eight weeks. Some of these kids were 
like nine years old. I doubt if many parents would

17:13.069 --> 17:16.615
turn a nine-year-old into somebody for eight 
weeks. Last year, 1998, that camp had 15,000,

17:22.670 --> 17:27.376
which had become a Boys and Girls camp. It's the 
largest Boys and Girls Christian camp in the

17:27.576 --> 17:31.261
world, I guess. I know in Missouri, many, many 
students were really impressed that I knew about

17:31.281 --> 17:37.129
the camp and knew the whites. We had guys, women, 
girls and boys flying in from Spain, from South

17:37.629 --> 17:43.577
America. We had Edward Sennacher, Tom Landers, 
grandkids, you name any great Outstanding person

17:49.400 --> 17:53.605
in this United States, and they probably got 
somebody to thank too. All right, let's go back for

17:54.386 --> 17:58.932
a minute to both Mr. Penberthy and Mr. White. What 
made them such special people? What were their

18:02.717 --> 18:03.698
qualities? Give some examples. They were 
Christians. Okay. That's the main thing. Okay.

18:08.103 --> 18:09.285
And they liked people. Now, Doe Raleigh, this guy 
was trying, Doe was the first one. Mr. Penberthy

18:13.170 --> 18:18.797
was always, if I had to compare anybody to St. Paul, 
I'd pick him. Okay. He can't, of course. But I'll

18:20.914 --> 18:23.517
tell you an example of Spike. After Spike got his 
degree in electrical engineering, he went out to

18:23.538 --> 18:30.666
California to work on a master's. He worked in a 
foundry at night to go to school. And you know what

18:37.515 --> 18:39.016
kind of people he was. He took his Aggie ring off 
because he didn't want those people to think he was

18:39.036 --> 18:44.423
better than me. That's what kind of guy he was. I've 
never known a man... Spike, every night, he'd get

18:49.087 --> 18:52.291
down on his knees and pray. Thanks to God for taking 
care of him. They're just Christian men. They

18:56.917 --> 19:00.642
never talked, but they lived a Christian life. 
Plus, they were interested in young men. I don't

19:04.047 --> 19:04.367
know. If you've got that, you can do anything. 
Right now, intramurals reported to Spike. Spike

19:10.295 --> 19:13.980
reported to Pembroke. Mr. Penberthy reported to 
the president? Okay. Now, Mr. Penberthy was dean

19:18.278 --> 19:24.489
of men, and they had two branches, student 
activities and student affairs. Benny Zinn was

19:24.589 --> 19:26.613
head of student affairs. The back was head of 
student activities. This all came about after the

19:28.757 --> 19:30.701
war. Benny Zinn had everything pertaining to the 
college, the police, the mess halls, stuff. all

19:38.294 --> 20:08.065
this back at everything else presently give you a 
crisp yet described

19:38.294 --> 20:08.065
back up a little bit what i know that he played 
became a very different

19:38.294 --> 20:08.065
he was texas he

19:38.294 --> 20:08.065
came here i think in nineteen thirty seven and

20:08.804 --> 20:16.835
I understand this, and I can't prove it, you 
probably know, but he's responsible for the

20:08.804 --> 20:16.835
Goldside Park and for planting the flowers in 
Texas. That I believe is true. And he was

20:18.398 --> 20:32.958
president, and what I loved about that man, I was on 
a couple of little small committees, he would call

20:18.398 --> 20:32.958
a meeting, and he did not go away from the agenda. If 
we're going to be there five minutes, he started

20:33.078 --> 20:37.765
time, and he quit. We didn't talk football. We 
didn't talk about religion. We didn't talk

20:40.410 --> 20:41.331
politics. He stepped to the agenda, kept to the 
agenda. Once this time was up, then you could do

20:44.434 --> 20:47.756
whatever you wanted to. But he was very, very 
organized

20:47.816 --> 20:57.945
and a very honest man. I went to see him after he 
retired. In fact, he lived right behind this back

21:02.269 --> 21:04.551
over here. And I'd go out and visit. We'd talk and 
all. He said, you know, I don't think he was

21:08.727 --> 21:13.073
complaining. He said, you know, hardly anybody 
ever comes to me. He was the president. And you know

21:17.579 --> 21:22.765
as well as I do that A&M is a cold-blooded 
organization. It can be. It can be very

21:23.687 --> 21:25.409
cold-blooded. Now, his son about your age was... 
No, he was a little bit under his son's name, Henry

21:26.030 --> 21:31.938
Gilchrist. He's a lawyer in Dallas with a big law 
firm. Were you... When the students marched on the

21:37.347 --> 21:43.276
president's house about hazing, were you back 
when that occurred? I got involved in it when it

21:43.296 --> 21:44.839
went away. You want me to tell you that story? Yes. I 
lived in College U. We worked out football, and I

21:48.325 --> 21:58.040
was walking home and happened to go through what at 
that time was the assembly hall, where we used to

21:48.325 --> 21:58.040
have free movies on Saturday night. And it was 
right across the street from Preston's home, and I

21:58.060 --> 22:03.709
walked by, and there was this huge crowd of people 
in there. Being curious, I walked in there, and

22:04.263 --> 22:08.690
they were having a meeting about Gilchrist. And a 
lot of the state radio networks, I don't have any

22:09.631 --> 22:13.417
words, were here. And one guy got up in Clinton, but 
he knew that Gilchrist went every weekend down on

22:14.599 --> 22:22.431
the coast to a ship and took women out. Another said 
that he was absconding with funds from the

22:23.753 --> 22:30.083
exchange store and the wind tunnel. I've never 
been in a mall back and forth. It was horrible, just

22:32.005 --> 22:33.907
terrible. Everybody cheered. Nobody didn't even 
know who Gil Gilchrist was. Colonel Frank

22:39.112 --> 22:48.661
Anderson, another great guy here, who at one time 
had been commandant with dear friend of Gil, came

22:39.112 --> 22:48.661
out on the stage, like I say now, had on his uniform. 
He was not military at that time. He was practical.

22:51.824 --> 22:57.990
He came out on the stage in full military and tried 
to talk to defend Gil Gilchrist. It was horrible. I

23:01.435 --> 23:07.843
later apologized to Gibb because I didn't, I said I 
didn't have enough guts to stand up and defend you.

23:07.943 --> 23:10.426
And I was just like, okay, I'll sit down and listen. 
As you know, the Corps marched on his home at

23:10.446 --> 23:14.551
midnight with the band. And he didn't even give 
them the courtesy to come to the front door, which I

23:14.571 --> 23:20.318
really admired. Gibb Gilchrist, between College 
Station and Hearn, there is an underpass over a

23:20.338 --> 23:26.886
railroad track. And he used to be criticized 
severely because the road that's going to Highway

23:27.693 --> 23:40.773
6 is going down this direction, north, and then it 
veers a little bit northwest and goes around back

23:27.693 --> 23:40.773
to north and goes on through. And they said that he 
built this crooked road under that railroad

23:40.793 --> 23:45.120
crossing. But it turns out the state law requires 
that all undercrosses have to be a 90-degree

23:45.481 --> 23:51.330
angle. But he was criticized worse than Mr. 
Pemberthy was in the battalions. And primarily, I

23:57.089 --> 24:01.114
think it was because he went to Texas University. 
Well, and also, wasn't he trying to terminate all,

24:01.134 --> 24:05.319
some of that hazing? Yeah, he, well, yeah, 
everybody's talking. Yes, he was. In fact, I don't

24:11.106 --> 24:24.021
know if this is true or not, but I heard at the time 
that we came within one or two votes to lose McCord

24:11.106 --> 24:24.021
from the state congressman because of hazing. And 
the hazing was terrible. Now, the hazing was bad

24:25.203 --> 24:27.045
when I was here But people don't really 
understand. We didn't think it was bad. What was

24:31.986 --> 24:40.599
bad, when we as sophomores left here, left kids who 
had never gone through the Hazen program in

24:31.986 --> 24:40.599
charge, and they just went wild. They would march 
attention to Herndon, Texas. Sure. They'd stand

24:43.823 --> 24:46.567
them up at attention in the showers. When I was in 
the murals, I'd be walking down Joe Brout

24:48.570 --> 24:54.940
Boulevard and see these upper class and take these 
freshmen standing there and Screaming and

24:55.358 --> 24:58.323
hollering at them and blowing smoke in their face. 
Wouldn't even let them go to class. And I'd get

24:59.364 --> 25:01.247
right in the middle of it. It got that bad. It got 
away from this fun thing of busting your butt to

25:02.349 --> 25:08.258
this thing of mental haste, which is so bad. All 
right, so now you directed intramurals for how

25:08.519 --> 25:12.485
long? Until 1961. 61, so... Then I left. So 15? 
Well, from 48 to... Eight, 11, 13 years. 13 years.

25:27.545 --> 25:31.529
When you left Intramurals, what changes were 
there? Me or them? Them. Well, today people still

25:35.533 --> 25:39.357
think I work at A&M. I've lived here 57 years. And I 
don't know. A&M to me is where it's changed. It's

25:45.643 --> 25:47.485
kind of like your children you were talking about. 
You're with them. so much when they're little, and

25:49.122 --> 25:54.068
that you don't notice these gradual little 
changes as they get older. Now, the Aggies that

25:54.088 --> 25:59.093
come back, been gone 15 years, they come back, see 
this campus, they can't believe it. But when you

25:59.113 --> 26:01.336
grow up with it, you don't pay attention to it. But 
changes, the Corps was the same, the civilians

26:02.197 --> 26:07.182
were the same. The Corps was losing more of its 
advantage, I think, used to, whenever a Corps kid

26:07.683 --> 26:16.273
ran for office, he was going to win it, take a yellow 
and stuff like that. Civilians come in. But in 61,

26:17.540 --> 26:23.427
had you all changed the number of sports involved? 
Are you talking about the intramural? Yeah. No,

26:24.829 --> 26:26.211
no, they stayed the same. They're still today. 
Today they're so much bigger than we were then.

26:30.817 --> 26:33.360
Your facilities were about the same? The 
facilities kept going the same until just after

26:33.380 --> 26:37.625
the girls got here. The girls changed things. 
Right, let's see. Then in terms of leadership,

26:39.968 --> 26:45.656
Spike left. Who replaced him? being a student. 
Well, that's when MSC opened up, seeing all that

26:48.866 --> 26:52.173
moved over there, when Wayne Stark took over. Now, 
your friend, Charles McCann, took my job. Charles

26:56.122 --> 27:00.432
worked for me when he was a student, a dollar an 
hour. And when I decided to leave to go into

27:01.374 --> 27:05.704
insurance business, they... Mr. Petey asked me, 
could you recommend? And I said, well, there's

27:09.198 --> 27:11.081
only one guy that can do it. He's ever been around. 
It's Charles McKenna. He's in school down here. He

27:16.049 --> 27:20.857
came on up here, and he later became a provost. He 
took it, and a guy named Les Palmer took it, and some

27:20.897 --> 27:26.005
others. But I used to get awfully unhappy when I had 
intramurals that nobody would come down and watch

27:26.145 --> 27:33.497
it from the campus. I said, man, that's the 
greatest thing we've got on this world. Nope. I'd

27:37.091 --> 27:38.813
call Mr. Gilkerson. He'd come down. Mr. Rudder 
would come down sometime. Then, you know, I left.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.422
I've never been back over there. Never have seen 
him again. During your era, who else had an

27:47.845 --> 27:54.654
intramural program similar to A&M's? Texas and 
Ohio State probably had the two greatest. I went to

27:57.618 --> 27:59.480
a convention one time. They were way ahead of us. 
They ran a little differently. procedures but

28:02.317 --> 28:25.978
Texas probably had a better not better but equal to 
us but they had more selfies and Ohio State was

28:02.317 --> 28:25.978
claimed most to say they had the greatest they 
probably did right in that 13 years more kids began

28:02.317 --> 28:25.978
to get automobiles and so forth but did the 
participation rate remain it did in the course

28:26.262 --> 28:29.026
because it was kind of compulsory. The civilians 
was not, but it kept up, but the civilians did not

28:29.266 --> 28:35.555
keep up with the Corps. For example, we had two of 
everything. We had a freshman football team and an

28:37.758 --> 28:40.061
up-class football team. We had a freshman 
basketball team. Each outfit had to have two

28:41.743 --> 28:46.830
seats, so we got every one of the kids like that. 
They didn't have a lot of choice for anything,

28:47.010 --> 28:53.099
particularly in wrestling, boxing, and those 
things, so we finally cut those out. All right, now

28:53.119 --> 28:53.960
let's see. Mr. Penberthy... He held that job. I 
don't remember how long. A long time. Yeah, and

29:00.804 --> 29:03.006
what happened there? I don't know. Did he got 
shafted? Was he replaced by Hennigan? No, yes, I

29:12.375 --> 29:13.696
think. Let me tell you what happened without going 
into why. This man in 1924 or whatever came here and

29:18.621 --> 29:25.648
started this thing from scratch. He was head of the 
PE department when he left and went to being a man,

29:26.219 --> 29:33.867
which a lot of people didn't want him to. After he 
left being a man, he went back to the PE department

29:34.248 --> 29:43.197
as an instructor in volleyball because he needed 
to finish out his tenure to get his retirement. He

29:43.217 --> 29:48.823
even went to, and I didn't know this while he told me 
this, he went to California to learn about

29:43.217 --> 29:48.823
volleyball. And he came back to hear Carl Landis. 
and Carl Tishler were running a program who he had

29:51.211 --> 30:00.161
hired, and he was a little peon for us raising to it 
and working. Not many men could do that. That's

30:01.522 --> 30:02.043
right. And never, ever has he ever criticized 
that. Right. All right, let's see. Did you have any

30:09.051 --> 30:13.936
relationship with President Morgan? No. Because 
I don't find many people that remember him and have

30:14.957 --> 30:21.184
many comments about him. All right, when 
President Rutter comes in 59, did he have any

30:21.620 --> 30:30.730
interest in intramurals, as you recall? Yeah, 
well, of course, that wasn't his agenda, but I told

30:30.750 --> 30:43.123
you this morning, Earl Coates at Carlton State in 
1939-40, when I was senior high school, and that's

30:30.750 --> 30:43.123
when I first met him. Now, we weren't 
buddy-buddies, because he was just a rural Rutter

30:44.164 --> 30:47.728
in the last 32 years. But when he came down here, my 
daughter happened to be the same age as his two

30:48.552 --> 30:54.018
daughters, and they went to school together. My 
nephew and Bob, Bud, his son, were roommates here

30:54.719 --> 30:59.505
when they were friends. Oh, really? So, and 
Margaret and I were good friends. We all went to

31:02.669 --> 31:05.752
Method Church for a place, and Pinky Downs was 
there, you know. Yeah. But Earl was, I didn't see

31:06.773 --> 31:10.678
him a lot, but. I've got some letters in there he's 
written me, and I like everybody else. Somebody

31:15.498 --> 31:23.032
says, I think we need a dormitory just to house all 
his roommates, and

31:15.498 --> 31:23.032
that's what I'm doing. But, yes, if I wanted 
something, I didn't go to him, certainly, but he

31:23.052 --> 31:30.405
would talk to me, and we were on...
