WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:22.340
was again coordinating their activities with the 
registrar and admissions liaison with the

00:03.136 --> 00:22.340
president, provost, activities there, dealing 
with the curriculum matters, those kinds of

00:03.136 --> 00:22.340
things. Ed was excellent to work with in the sense 
that obviously there were times when people

00:22.520 --> 00:31.371
thought they should be admitted He was always 
perfectly willing to counsel with those people.

00:35.412 --> 00:44.383
If my staff wasn't able to handle it and I was not 
able to handle it, then Ed would take over the chore

00:35.412 --> 00:44.383
and would handle the situation. I think Ed was 
always fair with the students on the thing. He was

00:49.909 --> 00:54.675
fairly fair with us.

00:56.714 --> 01:03.300
Obviously, sometimes he felt the student should 
be admitted when somebody else may not have, and

00:56.714 --> 01:03.300
that was all right, too. I mean, it was his job to 
make that decision, I think. Sometimes did he

01:06.884 --> 01:13.430
overrule a decision you all made on admissions? 
Yeah, in a sense that we had a kind of an appeals

01:13.850 --> 01:22.198
process fixed up. Not only a written appeal thing, 
which Ed was involved in, a lot of times, but verbal

01:27.055 --> 01:30.139
appeals. A lot of times, a person might come to 
Gale, for instance, and want to be admitted, and it

01:30.159 --> 01:42.918
didn't meet requirements, and they weren't 
satisfied with talking to Gale, so they'd want to

01:30.159 --> 01:42.918
talk with me, and they'd talk with me, and they 
weren't satisfied talking to me, and they'd want

01:30.159 --> 01:42.918
to talk with Ed. And there were some occasions when 
Ed felt that they should be admitted after maybe I

01:43.679 --> 01:53.653
had recommended they not be. I just told him that I 
couldn't admit them, but they're perfectly

01:56.452 --> 02:01.079
welcome to talk to the dean if they want to. And he 
sometimes would see it the way I did, and sometimes

02:01.820 --> 02:07.688
would see it differently the way I did, which 
didn't make any difference to me. What was the most

02:08.109 --> 02:19.945
common argument for this person to be admitted who 
didn't meet the stated remission requirements?

02:20.246 --> 02:24.552
What was their most

02:20.246 --> 02:24.552
likely argument? reason?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.257
It's hard to say. Probably the fact that, you know, 
I know he hasn't done it, but I know he's got the

02:31.277 --> 02:38.243
ability to do it, and it's just a matter of him 
getting down to do it. These kinds of things. I'll

02:41.326 --> 02:55.118
give you a couple of examples, like at least one, 
two, of things, you know, they never got to Ed, but

02:41.326 --> 02:55.118
there are appeals, I think. One, was a young man who 
had multiple

02:56.138 --> 03:04.087
dystrophy, I believe. He was confined to a 
wheelchair, and I do not, he was a muscle problem

03:04.228 --> 03:09.434
and that. And he

03:09.454 --> 03:19.506
came, I guess they set up an interview probably. 
Anyway, talked with he and his parents, come to

03:19.526 --> 03:23.310
find out his parents were both graduates of the 
University of Texas in Austin, but for some reason

03:23.763 --> 03:33.077
he decided he wouldn't come to Texas A&M. And that 
was the time, if you remember Haskell, we really

03:33.758 --> 03:40.908
didn't have great facilities for students who 
were in wheelchairs. We were working on it and

03:40.969 --> 03:46.316
doing a reasonable job, I think. But they had 
talked, I believe, with the people in the

03:53.311 --> 03:54.653
handicapped student's office. I don't know what 
it was called at that time. But they were satisfied

03:57.337 --> 04:06.209
that he could handle a situation and that they 
would provide him with whatever help that he might

03:57.337 --> 04:06.209
need on the thing. And anyway, they wanted him 
admitted.

04:11.697 --> 04:20.329
And it wasn't that, I don't remember exactly, I 
feel relatively sure he had met the admission

04:11.697 --> 04:20.329
requirement. There was certainly some concern 
about his being able to handle them. For example,

04:25.199 --> 04:27.945
they could just get him admitted for a year. They 
didn't think he'd live a year. Well, he got

04:29.909 --> 04:35.923
admitted and not only did he live a year, he lived 
long enough to graduate And in talking with one of

04:36.410 --> 04:44.499
our former regents who knows him quite well, he is 
now a lawyer and doing very well. The young man, you

04:45.640 --> 04:51.666
know, he's married, has, I think, a family. But 
anyway, it's a real success story in the fact that

04:51.887 --> 04:54.990
that. I have another girl, and I do not know really 
whatever happened to her. I don't know that she did

04:59.615 --> 05:00.956
graduate. She had rheumatoid arthritis so bad 
that she could barely get along. Her hands were

05:06.147 --> 05:09.551
crippled and she was kind of pumped. And again, her 
parents were asking and I'm not too sure, I don't

05:09.571 --> 05:21.425
think that they had a problem, but something had 
happened that she didn't meet admission

05:09.571 --> 05:21.425
requirements. But anyway, we admitted her and 
sure enough, four years later I saw her graduate by

05:21.445 --> 05:28.173
walking across the stage. And it's those kind of 
things which made the experience that I

05:37.025 --> 05:43.031
I remember the success stories, a few of them, a 
whole lot more than I remember those that we turned

05:37.025 --> 05:43.031
down. And a lot of them that we admitted, 
periodically some kid would come by and says, just

05:43.151 --> 05:53.080
wanted to let you know you admitted me, you made an 
exception, and I graduated. And I even received,

05:53.841 --> 06:00.107
at one time, a copy of a diploma in a tube the guy had 
sent me. And he says, I just wanted you to know that I

06:00.147 --> 06:02.930
made it. And I still have a copy of the diploma in 
there. Now, were these appeals for admission,

06:07.062 --> 06:22.278
were they any more likely to come from small towns 
than big cities or working class, white collar?

06:23.279 --> 06:27.604
Was there any generalization about the kind of 
families they came from and geographically? As I

06:27.664 --> 06:31.088
recall, they did. I mean, it's kind of across the 
board. The thing which I enjoyed... in the early

06:35.767 --> 06:53.860
years was the fact that we were

06:35.767 --> 06:53.860
given the opportunity if we thought an exception 
should be made to make it. For the most part, I told

06:54.667 --> 06:59.612
my staff that if you think an exception ought to be 
made, go ahead and make it. You don't have to come to

06:59.632 --> 07:01.715
me and ask about it. If you want to, fine, we'll 
discuss it. But you can do that. I felt I had the same

07:05.619 --> 07:09.964
thing with Dean Cooper. He never said, don't make 
any exceptions. He says, you admit those you think

07:12.487 --> 07:16.131
should be admitted. But at the same time, he says, 
if you want my input on the thing, I'll be glad to do

07:16.791 --> 07:22.838
that on the thing. Did you ever get any 
communication, letter, phone call, or anything

07:25.345 --> 07:34.098
else from anyone, quote, in the higher 
administration to admit so-and-so? In the

07:36.201 --> 07:41.529
administration, yeah. Again, if the president 
felt someone should be admitted or the vice

07:41.990 --> 07:48.720
president president or provost, whom everyone 
felt somebody should be admitted, that was their

07:49.696 --> 07:56.064
prerogative. But I'm thinking about at this 
point, Williams and Byers or Williams and

07:56.084 --> 08:14.509
Calhoun, was it their style to communicate with 
you or Ed and say, I got a letter and I told them that

07:56.084 --> 08:14.509
so-and-so would be admitted?

08:14.529 --> 08:17.593
Or would they pass it down to you or Ed? They would 
generally pass it down to Ed. I got very few calls

08:20.993 --> 08:24.057
directly. And we, I guess in all honesty, we got 
very few demands for admitting students.

08:34.791 --> 08:44.003
And I soon learned, at least in my mind as a 
rationalization, that it wasn't worth making

08:34.791 --> 08:44.003
some person who could do the university some good 
to make them mad just because we didn't feel a

08:45.451 --> 08:54.104
student could be admitted. I never hesitated to 
tell anybody that I thought it was a mistake as far

08:54.725 --> 09:08.145
as the student is concerned because in the fact 
we're doing the student a disservice I think

08:54.725 --> 09:08.145
rather than doing some particular person a 
disservice on the time. We had one chancellor who I

09:10.915 --> 09:16.463
really enjoyed working with in the sense that he 
never called and said he'd met somebody. He often

09:17.084 --> 09:22.152
called and said, would you look at a person's 
application and tell me what you think about it.

09:22.172 --> 09:24.976
Who is that? All right. Because to me that's 
complimentary. It is. It's Dr. Atkinson. Perry

09:30.203 --> 09:30.965
Atkinson. Perry Atkinson. And I don't recall that 
he was always, would you look and see what you've

09:31.525 --> 09:37.554
got and let me know. And usually I wouldn't. I would 
always look, and I would say, here's why I think we

09:39.805 --> 09:46.812
shouldn't, or there may be a chance if you feel like 
we should. And most oftentimes, he said, I think

09:47.693 --> 09:51.476
you're right. It would not be a good service to the 
student. Because that seems to me to be a very

09:54.239 --> 09:58.123
sensitive and thoughtful way to handle it. Let's 
go back to Williams and Calhoun replaced Byers.

10:06.198 --> 10:12.806
and not long after Dr. Williams got here, describe 
working with them. I was pretty well insulated, I

10:15.589 --> 10:17.852
think. Ed worked with them mostly. Occasionally, 
Dr. Williams would call and ask about a student, as

10:20.215 --> 10:27.043
I recall, but very seldom. Generally, what 
contact we had with it was through Ed's office on

10:27.063 --> 10:35.513
there. And when did you all move over to the new 
building? The new building, that was Heaton Hall?

10:44.066 --> 10:44.227
Yeah.

10:47.997 --> 10:49.080
Early 80s, I guess. I was in charge of remodeling 
the thing. The old bookstore. The old bookstore,

10:55.927 --> 10:58.430
yeah. People asked, where are you? And I said, 
we're in Heaton Hall. They said, well, where is

11:02.013 --> 11:02.834
that? And I said, well, do you remember the old 
bookstore? And they said, no. And I said, do you

11:05.717 --> 11:07.299
remember the old laundry? And so it had three or 
four different functions over the years. Oh, I'd

11:10.422 --> 11:10.903
forgotten. It was the laundry before it was the 
bookstore, wasn't it? I think it was the laundry

11:13.105 --> 11:15.608
before the bookstore. so people you would 
recognize it from that and at least 70s and you had

11:15.993 --> 11:32.415
good space then yeah and we had good space we had 
more than uh we had where we were that's for sure uh

11:15.993 --> 11:32.415
it It wasn't the best of locations in the sense that 
it had no parking around it. But as far as we as

11:40.087 --> 11:44.614
operating in there were concerned, we had 
adequate space. And as we got different kinds of

11:45.395 --> 11:49.983
equipment, it even got a little better. We had 
originally planned to move the old photostat

11:50.023 --> 11:54.690
machine over there, which is a monster. which was 
taking up a lot of room. Back at the time, just

11:56.272 --> 12:00.516
before we got ready to move it over, they decided, 
no, we're not going to move that. We're going to go

12:00.556 --> 12:04.460
with a different kind of a transcript maker. So we 
didn't have to do that, which gave us a little more

12:04.581 --> 12:11.508
space there in the registrar's side of the thing. 
Did you have to worry with transcripts, or was

12:11.528 --> 12:15.853
admissions only? Admissions only. I didn't have 
to worry about the transcripts with all of the

12:16.814 --> 12:20.898
records keeping. Summarize the... ritual 
routine problems of transfer admissions?

12:31.084 --> 12:46.843
Transfer admissions is a real problem in the sense 
that students would take coursework at other

12:31.084 --> 12:46.843
schools which may or may not fit in with our 
curriculum here. It got better as statewide we

12:48.004 --> 12:54.732
began to get more cooperation I think as I recall 
and you may remember too through some legislation

12:54.965 --> 13:19.015
which was done probably which required schools to 
do certain things but the admissions and

12:54.965 --> 13:19.015
registrars

12:54.965 --> 13:19.015
throughout the state had gotten together too and 
were doing a lot of cooperative work so that we had

12:54.965 --> 13:19.015
some core courses which we could all identify with 
in the first two years. And you get into your upper

13:22.643 --> 13:30.913
division courses, then it got a little more 
complicated as far as what course would be

13:22.643 --> 13:30.913
equivalent to another course. But the transfer 
students

13:30.933 --> 13:42.927
comprised

13:30.933 --> 13:42.927
about

13:45.218 --> 13:48.565
I guess, of our new students each year. I may be 
wrong on that, but most of them came in in

13:48.585 --> 13:52.995
September. We had a good number come in in January. 
We had very few freshmen come in in January term.

13:59.128 --> 14:04.780
And we worked with the junior colleges throughout 
the state trying to give them our course numbers

14:05.772 --> 14:18.374
and their equivalents so that a student, if he went 
to another junior college or community college,

14:05.772 --> 14:18.374
they would know from the very beginning what 
courses they ought to take in order to have that

14:05.772 --> 14:18.374
account for a specific course at Texas A&M. It 
worked real well as long as the student didn't

14:18.394 --> 14:22.802
start changing curriculum. When the student 
would start out in beds and didn't want to change

14:23.508 --> 14:30.697
over to engineering, obviously, quote, he lost 
some courses. He didn't really lose the course

14:30.717 --> 14:35.584
credit, but he had courses which he couldn't use on 
that program. Had he been at A&M and done the same

14:35.604 --> 14:40.991
thing, he would have still been in the same 
situation, though. But that's where the, that's

14:41.011 --> 14:43.794
usually, it's always the biggest gripe. I lost 
hours when I transferred to Texas A&M, and they

14:43.895 --> 14:48.701
really didn't lose them. They had taken 
coursework, which wouldn't count on a degree

14:48.721 --> 14:51.945
program. Were there any big transfer sources for 
us? Did we get more transfers from these schools?

15:03.243 --> 15:14.234
Well, the biggest one probably was still Blinn, 
because a lot of students went to Blinn and they

15:03.243 --> 15:14.234
were transferring. When they opened the campus 
here in Bryan, it really got to be a feeder source.

15:22.081 --> 15:32.075
got a lot from Houston Community College, you'd 
get a lot from Tarrant County Community College

15:22.081 --> 15:32.075
system and from Dallas where they had, and San 
Antonio, where they had the big community

15:22.081 --> 15:32.075
colleges. Some of the smaller community colleges 
you might have given two or three a year, but others

15:33.557 --> 15:40.087
you'd give fifty, a hundred, or whatever the 
situation may be. And were any of the programs here

15:40.107 --> 15:48.038
getting more transfers than the others?

15:52.102 --> 15:54.585
Probably, and probably because they were larger. 
I mean, I'm sure engineering, I'm guessing now,

15:54.605 --> 16:05.939
would probably get more transfers than would, 
say, liberal arts, maybe, or some of the smaller

15:54.605 --> 16:05.939
colleges at that time. As the liberal arts college 
got bigger, they were probably getting more

16:06.479 --> 16:11.245
transfer students, too. But early on, it was 
mostly agriculture and engineering. Which

16:15.210 --> 16:22.058
institutions were the most pleasant to work with 
on transfers?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.443
I really don't know what I could say. I didn't work 
directly and transfer it with them that way, but we

16:26.743 --> 16:34.057
had, I think, a good working relationship with 
most all of them. We knew each other through the

16:34.077 --> 16:37.002
professional organizations. And, you know, if we 
had a problem, I can remember a fellow at Tyler

16:37.022 --> 16:45.818
Junior College But again, if he had a problem, if a 
kid came in and said, I've got a problem, can't get

16:47.772 --> 16:53.844
something transferred, he wouldn't fuss. He'd 
call us up and say, what's going on down there? And

16:57.050 --> 17:00.758
we could usually work out the problem on the thing. 
A lot of times, parents would fuss, would complain

17:01.539 --> 17:07.030
back to the community college. It was a matter of, 
and I say miscommunication, either we didn't

17:07.010 --> 17:16.060
communicate properly or the student hadn't done 
what they were supposed to do to begin with. But we

17:16.381 --> 17:21.566
tried, and I really thank you, we had a good working 
relationship with all the community colleges. We

17:21.587 --> 17:35.262
tried to, early on, they had college days just like 
the high schools did, and we would try to have a

17:21.587 --> 17:35.262
representative teach one of the junior college 
college days so we could talk to the students as

17:21.587 --> 17:35.262
well as talk to the representative from the 
college to let them know what courses they needed

17:35.798 --> 18:03.088
to take and how to google that transfer and so forth 
and i'm assuming that many of the problems i'm

17:35.798 --> 18:03.088
putting the word problem in quotation marks from 
the student and or the parents point of view came

17:35.798 --> 18:03.088
from the student's failure to communicate 
clearly to the parents what the problem was with

17:35.798 --> 18:03.088
the transfer With the loss of hours, as you were 
mentioning a while ago, with the failure for the

18:06.764 --> 18:14.912
student to take at the junior college the kinds of 
courses that would be countable toward a degree

18:06.764 --> 18:14.912
here. I mean, that's probably correct. Again, we 
felt like we were doing a very good job in letting

18:17.374 --> 18:25.522
the student know what they should take. 
Obviously, some things fell through the cracks,

18:25.542 --> 18:34.611
but if the student planned, we thought, there was 
no reason why they couldn't Just interface from

18:35.165 --> 18:40.990
the community college right over into the 
university without any loss at all. And I think for

18:41.010 --> 18:43.553
the most part, most of them probably did. All 
right, now we're going from 71 in your service to

18:44.494 --> 18:52.000
what year? 19, January 93 is when I retired. Okay, 
so 22 years. In those 22 years, did we become more

18:56.364 --> 19:03.591
selective gradually in admissions? Yes. Do you 
remember any particular times when those changes

19:05.253 --> 19:11.042
were made? I think we went to, I recall that we 
started off at top half and 800 on the SAT, and I

19:11.062 --> 19:29.850
don't remember the, I think at 18 on the ACT, but I 
may be wrong on that, but let's talk about SAT. We

19:31.052 --> 19:34.197
went from that, and I believe it was in the early, 
80s that we jumped to a criteria which said uh 1200

19:34.615 --> 19:51.915
in the bottom quarter 1100 in the second quarter 
and a thousand in the top quarter with an automatic

19:34.615 --> 19:51.915
admission now if you had less than the thousand the 
top quarter and I think down to 800 we would we did in

19:52.790 --> 20:14.578
what we call a review process where we would look 
individually at the application to see what

19:52.790 --> 20:14.578
courses they took what high school they came from 
what their scores were what letters of

19:52.790 --> 20:14.578
recommendation they may have and so forth so we had 
an automatic admission we had a those admitted by

19:52.790 --> 20:14.578
review Then we had those who were denied, and then 
those who were denied fit again fit into the two

20:14.761 --> 20:21.943
categories of summer school and not summer 
school. However, at that time, summer school

20:21.963 --> 20:27.420
became more restrictive in that we limited the 
number that we could take because we had to, as we

20:27.991 --> 20:41.404
began to put in some kinds of enrollment control, 
which started somewhere around 86, 87, I've

20:27.991 --> 20:41.404
forgotten what it was. We had to make some kind of 
prediction of how many we were going to get out of

20:41.504 --> 20:45.568
the summer school. So we would know, we tried to get 
a freshman class of X number at that time. So we were

20:51.014 --> 20:57.340
restricting it more and more toward a limited 
enrollment of freshmen. How were those admission

20:57.691 --> 21:03.605
decisions, admission requirement decisions? Do 
you remember how they were made, how they were

21:03.625 --> 21:08.316
shaped? And where I'm headed is, were those 
changes made in a fashion that you think, in

21:08.336 --> 21:16.375
hindsight, worked well? Statistically, I think 
they were. I think they were, the cutoff scores and

21:20.072 --> 21:27.782
stuff were, they were run through models which the 
the Academic Counseling Center, is that the

21:28.977 --> 21:32.221
correct term? The Management and Testing, excuse 
me, that's what it is. They ran some models, and

21:36.305 --> 21:43.934
they said if the students meet these 
requirements, they ought to be able to go ahead and

21:36.305 --> 21:43.934
graduate. And then it says there are others who, if 
they meet certain requirements, still should be

21:44.054 --> 21:48.840
able to. But again, we wanted to, for ease of 
operation, I mean, probably, If I had had my

21:58.373 --> 22:08.150
druthers, we would have operated like the 
University of North Carolina did in that they

21:58.373 --> 22:08.150
review every application individually. Well, we 
just didn't have the staff to review every

22:08.170 --> 22:18.407
application individually and they were not 
inclined, and I don't know that we asked for, to

22:19.079 --> 22:20.381
give us a staff to do that. It just takes a lot of 
people. They had, I think when I visited, when they

22:21.783 --> 22:33.418
had 24 reviewers working year-round, I had a 
director of freshman admissions and three clerks

22:21.783 --> 22:33.418
or something like this. So we decided that we would 
take a group that we felt comfortable with and

22:35.922 --> 22:43.171
admit those automatically. Another group which 
we felt could probably be successful but we

22:47.378 --> 23:15.276
couldn't take them all but try to review those and 
take the best ones out of there and again apply not

22:47.378 --> 23:15.276
just the criteria class rank and a test score which 
is those two are together are the best predictors

22:47.378 --> 23:15.276
they're not perfect but they're the best but there 
are some others who there are other factors which

22:47.378 --> 23:15.276
we could consider oh now we're now we're into 
important territory so stay with this let's make

23:15.475 --> 23:38.867
believe that that I'm the Senate now and what if you 
only had one factor what would be the most

23:15.475 --> 23:38.867
important factor to look at is it class rank or is it 
test score

23:15.475 --> 23:38.867
I I would look at class rank if I only had one factor 
to look at. I would look at where he ranks in that

23:43.093 --> 23:44.935
class. Okay, now let's go to the other extreme. 
What is the best of all possible combinations

23:47.398 --> 23:52.523
based on your experience? Well, again, I think the 
combination of test score and class rank is the

23:54.865 --> 24:00.951
biggest two predictors. All right, but what else? 
Would you look at anything else? Yeah, I would want

24:03.273 --> 24:08.078
to look at the high school they came from. whether, 
again, class rank in a small school is important,

24:08.311 --> 24:17.131
class rank in a big school is important. You can 
look at other activities which they participate

24:17.492 --> 24:23.907
in, whether you're talking about athletics or 
whether you're talking about for the class

24:23.887 --> 24:30.978
officers or their extracurricular activities 
and things like that, which they did. Some

24:31.819 --> 24:34.923
students, well, they had to work to help support 
the family. Some students, I'm sure, were on their

24:34.964 --> 24:38.629
own even, those kind of things. And it's hard, you 
know, you get down, when you get past, I think,

24:39.230 --> 24:48.123
class rank and test score, there are a lot of little 
things which can add to it. Which one is the most

24:48.143 --> 24:50.046
important? I would hate to say, but there are a lot 
of factors which you can look at and make a better

24:50.785 --> 24:57.134
overall picture on the thing, though. In terms of 
the likelihood of their success at A&M,

24:57.154 --> 25:10.053
of the activities in high school, which were the 
most valuable activities?

25:16.603 --> 25:19.527
Is being a class officer more important than 
athletics? is being involved in a number of

25:20.384 --> 25:22.969
organizations?

25:27.277 --> 25:44.468
I don't know I need to say I think I really think the 
leadership properties are probably very

25:27.277 --> 25:44.468
important to them and I can think of an example when 
we were this is early on we were really trying to get

25:27.277 --> 25:44.468
National Merit students here and I remember I 
don't know what the situation was. We reviewed the

25:49.211 --> 25:50.273
page. I don't even remember the student, if I could 
even call his name. But he had about two pages of

25:54.062 --> 25:56.748
activities. Excellent work, everything else. 
And he got up here and he busted out after a year.

26:01.390 --> 26:03.273
because he didn't have his priorities straight. 
He was still participating in all the

26:03.353 --> 26:09.083
extracurricular activities and everything, and 
I think he stayed out a year or two. I think he came

26:09.163 --> 26:17.357
back, and I think he graduated and did well, but 
it's one of those things when if you look at it on

26:09.163 --> 26:17.357
paper, there's no way in the world he could 
possibly not succeed. But that's the other

26:17.776 --> 26:26.166
factor, which is so intangible, and that's their 
motivation and their application and things like

26:17.776 --> 26:26.166
this. And that's where a lot of times you can take a 
student, after you've talked to them a while, I

26:26.206 --> 26:35.396
think you get a feel as to how they're going to 
perform and do certain things. I mean, obviously,

26:35.997 --> 26:41.123
if they don't have some of the academic 
background, they're not going to be successful.

26:41.704 --> 26:42.805
But if they've got the what I would call the minimum 
academic background. And if they're willing to

26:46.169 --> 26:58.188
work hard, if they come from a family which values 
work, discipline, and things like this, I'd take a

26:46.169 --> 26:58.188
chance on them because I think they would be 
successful. They're not going to be a 4.0 student,

26:58.208 --> 27:03.096
but they're going to graduate. And as we know from 
looking at statistics, a lot of those who

27:03.116 --> 27:10.868
graduated with minimal scores have done very well 
in the business world. What about if they came from

27:11.185 --> 27:19.136
a non-native American born parent or parents? Is 
that an advantage or a disadvantage in a marginal

27:20.337 --> 27:28.448
student's admission?

27:31.412 --> 27:33.215
Their parents immigrated from somewhere. Again,

27:34.476 --> 27:38.762
I don't know. I wouldn't want to talk to the 
student. I want to look at their academic

27:40.826 --> 28:02.742
background and so forth and sometimes even 
talking to their parents or knowing what their

27:40.826 --> 28:02.742
parents have done and everything because I think 
that sometimes the immigrants can instill in the

27:40.826 --> 28:02.742
students a worth ethic, which to me is still one of 
the most important things, that they've got a good

27:40.826 --> 28:02.742
worth. work ethic, they can overcome some of the 
other things. They have to maybe do different

28:08.107 --> 28:11.231
things. They've got to have some good counseling 
when they get here and I always

28:11.271 --> 28:30.872
encouraged a student to not think they had to 
graduate in four years sometimes because

28:11.271 --> 28:30.872
sometimes they have to take the pace a little bit 
slower especially a lot of students are then and

28:11.271 --> 28:30.872
now are you know working And a lot of them are taking 
much longer because of having to work or wanting to

28:31.460 --> 28:39.492
work, depending on which one it may be. Like I heard 
the other day that somebody had seen an interview

28:40.273 --> 28:50.928
on national TV with Dat Nguyen and our, is it Dat or 
Nat? Dat. Dat Nguyen, our fine linebacker, and his

28:51.669 --> 28:55.034
parents. And according to the person who watched 
the program, that his parents are barely,

29:01.177 --> 29:03.520
competent in speaking English. That wouldn't 
surprise me. I think a lot of the first generation

29:06.504 --> 29:15.897
Vietnamese have not acquired a real skill with the 
language. But here he's done well. Income level

29:18.400 --> 29:28.213
would you give if a person was from a poor family as 
compared to a middle class or upper class family

29:18.400 --> 29:28.213
and marginal Would you and your folks have been 
more likely to give that person a little extra

29:29.510 --> 29:36.345
chance on admission?

29:43.201 --> 29:44.504
There may have been times. I'm not saying we, if a 
kid had come from them. an impoverished

29:49.642 --> 29:59.694
background, either financially or otherwise, 
but had worked hard and showed determination to

29:49.642 --> 29:59.694
succeed on the thing, yeah, we probably would give 
them a chance. Again, I think that's one of those

29:59.794 --> 30:05.001
intangibles which you can't see on paper. You can 
talk to people in this kind of thing. But where it

30:08.285 --> 30:19.378
looks like they're overcoming some kind of a 
handicap, to me, which would indicate a good work

30:08.285 --> 30:19.378
ethic, we would probably have given them a chance 
on the thing. Right. So we become gradually more

30:21.888 --> 30:29.359
selective in the 70s and 80s in admissions here, is 
that correct? That's correct. Do you remember any

30:29.700 --> 30:36.089
specific change that caused more ripples than any 
other? Was there a time when the admission

30:38.352 --> 30:44.020
requirement was modified and there were more 
howls?

30:47.025 --> 30:49.348
I think there were howls. We've had to limit the 
number, and it got worse early in the 90s, where we

30:49.615 --> 31:01.928
had to limit the number of freshmen that we can 
admit. I mean, we set the limit. Who set that limit,

31:04.191 --> 31:08.135
as far as you know?

31:14.141 --> 31:16.804
When you say who set it, obviously the president 
set it. Or the board, let me put it that way, it had to

31:17.138 --> 31:20.463
go to the board. The board set the limit if they 
wanted the student body to be, and I think the

31:20.503 --> 31:25.811
figure was 40,000. To keep it at 40,000, I think 
they decided that if you start off with 6,000

31:25.872 --> 31:36.548
freshmen and allow X number of transfers to-
