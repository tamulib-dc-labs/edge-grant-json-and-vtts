WEBVTT

00:01.685 --> 00:08.356
Vice President of the University of Texas at 
Dallas by Brenda Nolte on May 3, 1990. This is being

00:08.376 --> 00:12.783
recorded over the phone concerning the feminist 
movement. In interest of accumulating

00:12.803 --> 00:22.559
knowledge, I'm asking you to donate this tape to me 
or to the tape or to the Texas A&M Oral History

00:12.803 --> 00:22.559
Collection in the University Archives. Is that 
all right with you? That's fine. Okay. What's the

00:25.564 --> 00:27.287
date and place of your birth? July 27, 1941, in 
Ranger, Texas. Who was a big influence to you as a

00:34.339 --> 00:40.609
child, right at the moment? Yes, several of them. 
Both of my grandmothers,

00:44.454 --> 00:53.808
I think, were important in my life. I had an aunt 
that was... 10 years older than I am and 10 years

00:57.220 --> 01:04.929
younger than my mother. And she was the first 
college graduate

01:04.949 --> 01:24.231
on that side of

01:04.949 --> 01:24.231
the field

01:04.949 --> 01:24.231
and was the student leader at Baylor and was an 
airline stewardess for American Airlines in like

01:04.949 --> 01:24.231
1964 or something like that. And so she never 
married and was an independent

01:28.962 --> 01:48.188
And I had a

01:28.962 --> 01:48.188
high school home

01:28.962 --> 01:48.188
economics teacher that encouraged me to look at 
leadership positions. And my mother always

01:48.468 --> 01:52.273
pushed me to do things, although some of them were 
quite traditional. She always wanted me to have

01:52.293 --> 01:53.535
opportunities. And

01:55.996 --> 02:12.164
then I was

01:55.996 --> 02:12.164
a great reader of biographies. I worked in the 
library as a child. And I read the Bob Holmes

02:12.905 --> 02:13.566
series.

02:19.148 --> 02:33.112
What

02:19.148 --> 02:33.112
degrees did you receive in undergraduate and 
graduate school? Well, I have a very

02:33.132 --> 02:41.106
disjointed educational path, which may be 
untrue. We were encouraged

02:43.702 --> 03:13.253
to do these very traditional

02:43.702 --> 03:13.253
type

02:43.702 --> 03:13.253
degrees, and I have three undergraduate degrees, 
one in economics, one in art education, and one in

02:43.702 --> 03:13.253
applied art, and I have a minor in science, and I 
have a master's in art education, and a master's in

02:43.702 --> 03:13.253
liberal arts, and a doctorate in administration.

03:18.886 --> 03:21.210
Why did you receive a doctorate degree? Where? 
Yeah, why and where? What was the purpose of it? I

03:26.257 --> 03:35.451
got it because my other degree didn't allow me to do 
the things I wanted to do. And so I either had a

03:35.471 --> 03:37.514
choice of getting an MBA. I had taken a lot of 
research courses, seminars, and done a lot of

03:37.534 --> 03:43.864
leadership training.

03:47.658 --> 04:14.695
What

03:47.658 --> 04:14.695
was life like for a woman at the time you were in 
college? College college?

04:25.589 --> 04:26.611
Well, we had a 10 o'clock curfew. I was the one

04:26.631 --> 04:40.387
who called the

04:26.631 --> 04:40.387
board and said, this is the board for Hope and Dean, 
and this is my boyfriend. To whom I am now married

04:40.407 --> 04:40.968
to. Started going with my sophomore high school. 
You did not wear pants and flats. You didn't wear

04:42.570 --> 04:43.091
dressings. You were not encouraged to use your 
shoes. Well, there were a lot of classes in the

04:43.972 --> 04:45.053
girls' class. were

04:45.826 --> 04:59.424
not able

04:45.826 --> 04:59.424
to be admitted to

04:45.826 --> 04:59.424
the college. My daughter Renee is a man in Texas 
A&M. It was even questionable for girls to take

05:05.692 --> 05:11.940
life drawing and art life. It was very late. It was 
fairly... restrictive and a lot of girls started

05:14.648 --> 05:30.529
college

05:14.648 --> 05:30.529
with the idea that their goal was really to get 
married, not necessarily to get married. And

05:30.549 --> 05:34.274
particularly I think in the South, in the small 
towns, that was kind of the norm rather than the

05:30.549 --> 05:34.274
exception. And many, most of my high school What

05:35.101 --> 06:00.527
type of

05:35.101 --> 06:00.527
organizations were you part of concerning the 
women's issue? In college? For both, for college

06:02.049 --> 06:04.011
and then later on. There

06:04.379 --> 06:25.671
weren't

06:04.379 --> 06:25.671
any in college, particularly, although I held a 
high school. I was a state officer and teacher,

06:27.654 --> 06:31.280
homeowner for the man, which I think was very good 
because he was trained to do home economics, was

06:27.654 --> 06:31.280
the only school in Texas Tech that had a CMLD. And so 
there were good role models in CMA, although very

06:31.300 --> 06:32.682
traditional. And I didn't get active in CMA.

06:37.842 --> 07:05.223
As

06:37.842 --> 07:05.223
far as the formal organization, I joined the 
National Organization for Women, but I joined the

06:37.842 --> 07:05.223
local organization called Women for Change, and 
out of that group grew the Women's Center of

06:37.842 --> 07:05.223
Dallas, and I served as president of that 
organization in 1979-1976. That group was

07:05.243 --> 07:05.824
tailored to me

07:09.095 --> 07:35.637
the

07:09.095 --> 07:35.637
deeds of feminists in Dallas and started things 
like the Great Crisis and later it was raised the

07:09.095 --> 07:35.637
issue of violence in the family and started things 
later on there in training with the police during

07:09.095 --> 07:35.637
the Dallas Women's Credit Union. Took on a lot of 
those kinds of things

07:39.892 --> 08:03.707
I've

07:39.892 --> 08:03.707
worked closely with the Planned Parenthood on a 
lot of issues that women were raising. And when I

08:03.727 --> 08:07.232
was on that panel, Equal Access to Education, and 
there was an act called the Title IX, an amendment

08:03.727 --> 08:07.232
to the Education Act of 1972, and I worked actively 
to get that legislation aid passed and then

08:07.938 --> 08:17.889
implemented not only in Dallas but across the 
country. Did you involved in the Women's National

08:17.909 --> 08:21.973
Convention in Houston in 1977? Yes. As a matter of 
fact, I attended. I didn't have a leadership role

08:24.937 --> 08:27.439
then. It was fascinating. About six of us piled in a 
car in Dallas and drove to that convention. It was

08:36.288 --> 08:52.192
very interesting.

08:52.212 --> 09:00.785
Gloria

08:52.212 --> 09:00.785
Steinem came about that same year to Dallas, and we 
hosted her as the women's center. I had a private

09:00.805 --> 09:02.908
thing, a couple of private things for her. And the 
Women's Composing Committee, which now

09:02.928 --> 09:05.772
celebrates its 25th year, was a catalyst for many 
of these kinds of activities here in Dallas.

09:13.598 --> 09:23.513
What was the atmosphere like at the convention?

09:24.374 --> 09:25.275
Exciting. Yeah. Very upbeat, all new, kind of 
scary because rumors were that the Ku Klux Klan was

09:25.415 --> 09:40.177
going to pick it, and sure enough they did, but not 
any huge numbers. It was really fun, and it was my

09:40.197 --> 09:41.479
first political conference. What's

09:41.982 --> 09:56.843
your

09:41.982 --> 09:56.843
view on EPA and should it be passed?

09:56.863 --> 09:57.584
EPA or ERA? Oh, sorry, ERA. I'm sorry, ERA. EPA is 
environmental protection. Sorry about that,

10:03.272 --> 10:04.413
ERA. Well, I don't know. shame

10:08.071 --> 10:30.716
that we still are not legally part of the 
Constitution as we should have had in Texas, as a

10:08.071 --> 10:30.716
matter of fact, because I think the fourth state in 
the union has ERAs in them, and that is one of the

10:08.071 --> 10:30.716
reasons that gave legal emphasis to Roseburg and 
the Way growing up in Texas. Women have always been

10:31.510 --> 10:37.696
very

10:31.510 --> 10:37.696
independent. They had to be survived,

10:37.716 --> 10:52.511
just to move with, which is one of the reasons I 
always had a great admire of my grandmother's

10:37.716 --> 10:52.511
face. In very traditional roles, were very 
independent women, out of possession. They say,

10:56.175 --> 10:57.977
the place they birthed the babies, they grew the 
food, they built the homes. Really, women were

11:01.582 --> 11:24.617
or

11:01.582 --> 11:24.617
the basics to reason the frontier was settled and 
civilized. So it took quite a long time. The ERA

11:25.238 --> 11:28.483
passed in Texas, and there is a state ERA, still in 
Texas, which has given the company some legal,

11:25.238 --> 11:28.483
legal address, ways to address problems.

11:32.851 --> 11:54.538
How do

11:32.851 --> 11:54.538
you

11:32.851 --> 11:54.538
feel about the abortion

11:32.851 --> 11:54.538
issue? that

11:55.615 --> 12:20.975
no one should tell a woman what to do, what happens 
with her own body, and that everybody should have a

11:55.615 --> 12:20.975
right to decide whether or not they are prepared 
for those responsibilities here. And if

12:20.995 --> 12:21.876
reporting is last resort or anything, What were

12:23.847 --> 12:39.926
the general feelings of women after Roe v. Wade? 
Were they surprised that it passed through the

12:39.946 --> 12:45.252
Supreme Court? I think it's the time.

12:50.797 --> 13:13.255
we

12:50.797 --> 13:13.255
had think that that finally the country was 
working quite enough it was part of the whole heady

12:50.797 --> 13:13.255
era of the time that the right to be in central was 
raised. I think they had think that was part of the

13:13.275 --> 13:14.717
whole country coming of age. It was more of a shock 
that that right should be placed.

13:20.547 --> 13:39.625
Do

13:20.547 --> 13:39.625
you feel like

13:20.547 --> 13:39.625
in the 70s that women had

13:20.547 --> 13:39.625
equal opportunity in the classroom as well as in 
sports? Had it improved since the time you were in

13:39.765 --> 13:46.952
high school? No, it hadn't changed very much at 
all. I think with the advent

13:49.353 --> 14:04.458
of Title IX,

13:49.353 --> 14:04.458
there's been a lot of progress. When I started 
teaching students in Dallas in the early 60s and

14:04.478 --> 14:08.965
80s, lots of places were not available, shop 
places.

14:18.884 --> 14:46.288
I

14:18.884 --> 14:46.288
think a lot of the old-time teachers are not 
prepared for the whole issue of women's

14:18.884 --> 14:46.288
administration and should women be involved in 
it? Would men work for women? Would women be really

14:46.828 --> 14:48.790
good in the college and kind of manage the school 
and all those work issues? were

14:51.301 --> 15:07.487
dealt with in a relatively short time period. 
Title IX began in the mid-1930s in St. Mary,

15:07.507 --> 15:08.629
Ravensburg. In a five or six year period, I think 
there were some dramatic changes as far as girls

15:08.649 --> 15:10.592
back then.

15:17.980 --> 15:31.774
Have men liberated as quickly in this country as 
women?

15:31.794 --> 15:38.621
Do you think they're catching up now, or was there a 
big battle against? Well, I think in many cases

15:38.641 --> 15:43.206
backlash, and they are accepting, I think, the 
changes quickly because of the economic reality.

15:43.226 --> 15:44.467
Some of them have working lives. Very few families 
have survived today, you know, income.

15:55.139 --> 16:19.286
But

15:55.139 --> 16:19.286
women, unfortunately, still have two primary 
jobs. They're outside of the country. I think

16:19.947 --> 16:22.310
statistics show, over and over, studies show that 
men are on nearly the same number of hours of work as

16:19.947 --> 16:22.310
women. I think there seems to be a change among 
younger men.

16:34.812 --> 16:55.814
Has

16:34.812 --> 16:55.814
the general view towards women changed? Is it 
liberated? An example would be Sports

16:57.155 --> 17:02.541
Illustrated's some suit issue, the popularity 
of, oh, The

17:03.145 --> 17:27.617
old theory

17:03.145 --> 17:27.617
of consciousness, the fact that women still are 
judged in this much older look than anything else,

17:03.145 --> 17:27.617
and the fact that many women who are highly 
susceptible, married, And

17:29.690 --> 17:55.731
I think it's because economically, it goes back to 
economically, merchants depend on what they have

17:29.690 --> 17:55.731
there on the street.

18:02.275 --> 18:27.803
When

18:02.275 --> 18:27.803
the wife gets into a position where she has an 
opportunity to move to fix her career, the old norm

18:02.275 --> 18:27.803
often comes back into play. That's where the 
rubber

18:34.338 --> 19:00.110
A

18:34.338 --> 19:00.110
lot of jobs where a number of women have taken over 
the job in

18:34.338 --> 19:00.110
some ways is not impressive to us. It's not a real 
job.

19:04.865 --> 19:17.603
Now that the children of the movement are in their 
20s, what

19:04.865 --> 19:17.603
needs to be achieved?

19:21.588 --> 19:30.000
To continue

19:21.588 --> 19:30.000
my children and the children of the women's night, 
the women who were active in the movement, their

19:21.588 --> 19:30.000
children are going to have to become adults. The 
progress of the night is very fragile with the

19:30.020 --> 19:32.003
sub-churches who were in birth.

19:36.100 --> 20:04.701
that

19:36.100 --> 20:04.701
women

19:36.100 --> 20:04.701
are not included in the Constitution, that 
abortion rights is a matter that can be overturned

19:36.100 --> 20:04.701
by the death of one more justice on the Supreme 
Court, that America is a very

19:36.100 --> 20:04.701
small

19:36.100 --> 20:04.701
island in the world of stereotypical gender 
roles. The children of women my age have got to

20:04.721 --> 20:05.803
realize and

20:07.201 --> 20:29.676
not take all of their rights as an individual for 
granted in their lives. It's very fragile that it

20:29.696 --> 20:32.541
could be reversed, that they're going to have to 
revisit and revise some of these battles because

20:29.696 --> 20:32.541
they're all shaky. The walls are shaky and they 
couldn't have done it unless there is

20:37.390 --> 21:04.393
So,

20:37.390 --> 21:04.393
in that reason, I'm very delighted to see that you 
are examining the issues and talking about the

20:37.390 --> 21:04.393
reasons why the protection came down, some of the 
solutions that have worked for the last two years,

20:37.390 --> 21:04.393
where the cracks are and what the reasons are. Oh,

21:04.964 --> 21:20.025
yes. You're going to have to do a lot of education of 
young people your age. Sometimes. Well, and young

21:23.670 --> 21:24.191
women too. I think it's been very easy for young 
women to take for granted some of the privileges

21:24.211 --> 21:27.175
that have been handed down without understanding 
the history.

21:34.023 --> 21:38.550
Just for the last question, what are some of your 
favorite books? I'm glad we get to retake this

21:38.690 --> 21:52.331
because I thought of maybe one of the first, The 
Feminine Supreme, which was the story of my life

21:38.690 --> 21:52.331
and very revealing to me. The book Her Story, which 
is

22:10.979 --> 22:36.089
The

22:10.979 --> 22:36.089
Handmaid's Tale, which I think is a pseudo-time 
fiction of what can happen. And all of the elements

22:36.109 --> 22:37.551
of the Handmaid's Tale are in society right now. It 
is not that far back to that time. That if we are not

22:38.332 --> 22:39.273
digital, we are not digital. I think there's 
magazines that have been post-war.

22:47.024 --> 23:09.998
At

22:47.024 --> 23:09.998
the same time, you can't just have a feminist base. 
You need to have a good, sound, solid education.

23:10.999 --> 23:11.820
That's what I would change about my life. I would 
have gotten a Ph.D. in feminism. I would have

23:12.661 --> 23:13.723
focused my intellectual inquiry earlier. I 
wished

23:16.403 --> 23:38.712
that I had higher educational opportunities when 
I got into college. When I started college, I was

23:38.732 --> 23:43.137
told by my husband's counselor that I should not go 
to college, that I wasn't smart enough to finish,

23:38.732 --> 23:43.137
and that the best I should hope for is to marry a rich 
young man and become a housewife. My husband, who

23:43.157 --> 23:43.778
was my husband, Second

23:45.614 --> 23:59.607
thing I do is go to college and get a good degree and 
sign up for a contract and delay getting married

23:45.614 --> 23:59.607
until the end.

24:13.913 --> 24:18.321
The guidance I had not received along the way. It 
had to happen by hook or crook, and I was not... I was

24:26.635 --> 24:37.654
a very traditional girl,

24:26.635 --> 24:37.654
and I was married to a sweetheart. And so I was not a 
rebel. without a cause when

24:40.070 --> 24:50.686
I was young. I was a rebel with a cause when I was 
better. And now, again, I'm very, very

24:54.071 --> 24:56.635
respectful. Not the medical husband.

25:00.682 --> 25:06.871
Well, I look

25:00.682 --> 25:06.871
respectful. I'm 50, though. OK.
