00:07.068 --> 00:20.226
Um,

00:07.068 --> 00:20.226
how did the war and the dropping of the bomb, how has 
that affected you after you got out of the service

00:07.068 --> 00:20.226
and up to today?

00:23.430 --> 00:34.746
Well, I think the experiences of the war are, they 
had a great meaning to me at the time and they still,

00:23.430 --> 00:34.746
and still do. it was a time of sacrifice for 
everyone. Those overseas doing what they were

00:38.843 --> 00:45.889
called upon to do there and wanted back home. 
Everybody was in the mood to sacrifice, and they

00:47.410 --> 00:50.012
did. And once the war ended, you know, at that point 
your mind turned to, you know, let's go home with my

00:51.453 --> 01:04.044
family, pick up life, and get started again. I was 
still Twenty-one at the time. And I thought, well,

01:08.161 --> 01:11.504
twenty-two at the time, excuse me. And I thought, 
well, I've got to complete my education, and I'm

01:12.625 --> 01:21.054
married, I've got to get a career going here. So I 
can provide for my family and enjoy this peace that

01:22.055 --> 01:30.383
we have preserved, so to speak. I'm grateful 
really for the opportunity that I had to serve.

01:35.457 --> 01:39.981
They were great experiences, maturing 
experiences. In a time like that you can go from a

01:40.001 --> 01:47.649
kid to a man pretty quickly. It doesn't make any 
difference what your age is. When the time comes

01:51.733 --> 01:56.978
that you're required to be a man, and if you step up 
to it, and do a man's work does something to you. You

02:04.007 --> 02:04.548
mature. A lot of times I think we never get that 
opportunity. And I'm glad I had it because I think

02:09.394 --> 02:14.841
it's probably helped me all my life. Separate the 
real meaningful things from the

02:14.861 --> 02:23.472
shallow things. Worldly. Yeah. And so... it had a 
great meaning to me. I really wanted to get back and

02:29.551 --> 02:32.255
get going. So I was released from the service in May 
of 1946. I

02:38.143 --> 02:43.330
entered SMU in June of 1946. And prior to the war, I 
had 18 hours of college credits. So I started in

02:51.722 --> 02:55.888
June of 1946, and in August of 48, 26 months later, I 
had a bachelor of business administration degree

02:56.594 --> 03:00.519
from SMU. And I worked day and night, had night 
classes, day classes, wherever I could get a job.

03:07.707 --> 03:09.329
And I worked classes around that. And my dear 
companion worked. And we just, we went through

03:16.478 --> 03:18.620
this age. I lost about 30 pounds during that 26 
months going to school, working and studying and

03:18.681 --> 03:26.550
doing

03:29.281 --> 03:30.643
I wanted to get it done. I was in a hurry to get it 
done. It was like you jump out of that airplane at

03:33.005 --> 03:36.890
the end of the war running. Go. And so I did that. And 
I pretty well knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to be

03:42.617 --> 03:46.982
in the line of work that I got in and studied for. And 
have been successful, relatively. I retired

03:52.128 --> 03:56.233
six weeks ago. And I reached the level of Vice 
President in my company and had success there. I

04:03.838 --> 04:07.662
had more than one career. I was in real estate 
development and another career. And then came

04:11.867 --> 04:14.790
back to my original career and retired there. So I 
had a measure of success, you know. Nothing

04:17.734 --> 04:23.680
spectacular, but satisfying to me. That's 
success. I had a very happy life. Just before I

04:27.196 --> 04:32.962
graduated from SMU, our first child was born, our 
daughter. And then four years later, our son. So

04:37.726 --> 04:39.708
life's been good. I've been full. It's been 
meaningful.

04:45.434 --> 04:52.301
We've been devoted to church work and to doing the 
work of the Lord for many years. And it's just been

04:53.782 --> 04:54.663
happy. Peaceful, happy, joyful. Love my 
children, love my grandchildren. I think one of my

05:00.358 --> 05:03.101
greatest roles in life is to be a grandfather. I 
love to be a grandfather. Love to sit and talk with

05:06.104 --> 05:08.586
them. They think I'm an old relic. But they like to 
hear some of my stories. Of course. And I don't mind

05:16.294 --> 05:17.835
being an old relic. I suppose I enjoy my life today 
as much as I have ever enjoyed any time in my whole

05:17.996 --> 05:25.603
life. Well, that's super. And I expect to enjoy my 
future years even better. Well, retired is one way

05:31.344 --> 05:34.108
to definitely enjoy them. For sure. I'd like to 
retire at 24, but I don't know if that's going to be

05:34.589 --> 05:40.497
possible.

05:40.517 --> 05:43.741
Brother Gress, I've got one more question for you. 
When you look back at your experiences in war, and

05:43.761 --> 05:53.835
you were stationed, I take it, at Guam, overseas, 
what were like the main problems that were

05:54.440 --> 06:04.310
encountered on the ground between soldiers, 
between the men on the ground? What were the

06:04.450 --> 06:09.875
greatest conflicts as the war was winding down, 
the bombs being dropped? What were kind of

06:09.895 --> 06:14.219
conflicts, kind of frogging of officers? No, 
nothing like that. As far as, we had a small group.

06:24.055 --> 06:36.107
There was about,

06:24.055 --> 06:36.107
at the height of the war, we had, I believe, as I 
remember, we had 21 crews. Most of us were flying

06:36.127 --> 06:48.318
B-29s, but some of them flew B-24s and did radio 
jamming and picking up signals, interpreting

06:36.127 --> 06:48.318
signals and things of that nature. And so we were 
all kind of close. We had our own group. separate

06:53.333 --> 06:58.620
from the big 20th Air Force headquarters, our own 
officer's club and everything.

07:01.324 --> 07:15.223
We had our wing headquarters were back in Honolulu 
and our group headquarters in Denver, Colorado.

07:20.047 --> 07:27.336
off and then bring back bomb bays full of liquor and 
all kinds of things like this. And there was a lot of

07:27.356 --> 07:29.759
drinking. There was, with 21 crews in the war over, 
we didn't have a lot of flying to do. We'd ferry

07:38.269 --> 07:40.812
troops, we'd do all kinds of things. But as far as 
our normal mission, there was nothing to do. We did

07:49.207 --> 07:59.157
fly around and do some aerial photography on some 
different islands out of the Pacific just so

07:49.207 --> 07:59.157
they'd have the photographs and do things. And 
they proved very valuable later. But we were idle a

08:02.260 --> 08:06.524
lot. We'd go for maybe sometimes a week, maybe once 
in a while, even two weeks, and never fly. And so you

08:13.050 --> 08:14.452
really didn't have any duties. And so we would 
organize. physical education clubs. We got to

08:19.714 --> 08:21.417
play volleyball. It's hot on Guam. And you'd have 
to do that either early in the morning or you

08:23.780 --> 08:28.787
couldn't get anybody out to do it. So we spent a lot 
of time at the officer's club in the daytime. You

08:32.953 --> 08:40.283
know, guys would drink, get into arguments, and 
they might, you know, swing, take a couple swings

08:32.953 --> 08:40.283
at one another. But nothing serious ever really 
came in our entire group. There was not any

08:44.557 --> 08:49.083
disrespect of officers, but we respected the 
officers. They would help us. They started

08:52.948 --> 08:59.156
shipping everybody home on the basis of seniority 
and length of time overseas. Well, I was the young

08:59.196 --> 09:07.927
kid on the block, so to speak, and the war was over 
about six months before I ever came home. So I spent

09:07.947 --> 09:13.495
about six months just kind of wasting time goofing 
around. Tried to read a lot. whatever you know

09:14.999 --> 09:41.091
pastime and do slept a lot so it seems to me like the 
biggest problem was boredom well yeah because it

09:14.999 --> 09:41.091
just wasn't that much to do we'd go to the motor pool 
and get a truck or whatever we get and we just loaded

09:14.999 --> 09:41.091
full we just drive around the island just 
sightseeing and see things go down the beach and

09:14.999 --> 09:41.091
spend the whole day down there take some food with 
us learn on the beach and just just have fun you know

09:42.657 --> 09:46.885
Just to do whatever you could find, anything you 
could find to do, you'd go do it. That's super.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.731
Brother Grass, I appreciate the interview. I hope 
that other people get something out of it like I

09:49.751 --> 09:53.518
have. It's been great. I've enjoyed reliving the 
experience, Frankie. It's been fun for me, too.

10:01.033 --> 10:01.734
I've enjoyed it. Well, thank you very much. Thank 
you.
