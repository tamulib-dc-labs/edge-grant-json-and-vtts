WEBVTT

00:01.178 --> 00:13.784
Yeah, I guess

00:01.178 --> 00:13.784
I'm saying a big family in contrast to what exists 
now. We're such a big organization now that we kind

00:13.844 --> 00:20.318
of feel, I think, separate in our own more strongly 
with others in our own fields outside of our own

00:21.985 --> 00:28.176
institutions than we do even sometimes in our own 
institutions. I feel that here. And I was out of

00:29.839 --> 00:33.626
Scripps a couple of years ago on sabbatical, and I 
felt it there, too. Quite different from what it

00:33.646 --> 00:34.868
used to be. Probably associated with the bigness 
of the field. 200 research staff here and 200 or 300

00:40.615 --> 00:44.281
at Scripps. Right. So it's a big field, at least 
among the big institutions. Not big compared to

00:50.170 --> 00:55.999
other fields, but I feel the bigness of it now 
compared to what it used to be. And we're kind of

00:56.019 --> 01:00.746
split off into our separate disciplines to a large 
extent. So we've lost a little bit of that kind of

01:00.766 --> 01:08.158
perhaps adventuresome togetherness kind of 
spirit that we used to have. we're doing more

01:08.628 --> 01:36.002
specialized things more detailed things that are 
still exciting i feel so where should i go from here

01:08.628 --> 01:36.002
well uh so i only have one question about revel 
about this time revel is coming under a great deal

01:08.628 --> 01:36.002
of criticism concerning administration of 
scripps institution of oceanography uh and and i

01:08.628 --> 01:36.002
take it that was not your impression at all working 
with him or i didn't have that feeling he uh i think

01:08.628 --> 01:36.002
rogers way of organizing scripts, which 
essentially set the pattern for scripts to the

01:36.320 --> 01:50.340
present day, was to bring in really good people and 
let them really work on their own thing. And that

01:50.360 --> 01:55.147
perhaps created some animosities among these 
really good people. They were competing to some

01:55.167 --> 02:05.061
extent for funds and position in the university, 
and perhaps power to some extent. I didn't get

02:05.648 --> 02:08.953
involved with that too much in my own research. At 
least, I didn't feel it too much. Perhaps because I

02:10.675 --> 02:15.883
was working under Russ Raitt, who didn't have very 
many of those aspirations, I don't think. I didn't

02:16.384 --> 02:18.287
feel those pressures very much. But I knew these 
undercurrents were running its roots. I could see

02:22.012 --> 02:23.294
them around me. Well, I have the impression, may I 
be accurate, that as a matter of fact, if I may use

02:23.935 --> 02:35.352
the term, all the great men who ran the good 
institutions about this time, went through that,

02:35.686 --> 02:50.009
that is both Lamont and here at Woods Hole, that 
they tended to bring money down sort of in a block,

02:35.686 --> 02:50.009
sort of just give it to you and ask you what you could 
do and then come back a couple years later and check

02:35.686 --> 02:50.009
and if you did it okay and if you didn't you were 
gone. Did you prefer it to operate that way? Yeah,

02:53.371 --> 03:00.419
that was nice for me as a graduate student, because 
it means I didn't have to scramble for my own

02:53.371 --> 03:00.419
funding. Like now, I'd probably have to write a 
research proposal to get funding. And I didn't

03:04.904 --> 03:09.049
have any need to do that at the time. Some money just 
sort of came to me through professors who wanted

03:09.890 --> 03:15.596
this job done. And I said, here, you have this 
amount of money. Why don't you go out and see what

03:18.840 --> 03:21.623
you can do with this instrumentation? And 
essentially we went to see, you know, funded. And

03:26.098 --> 03:27.961
there it was. You're right. The money was a lot 
easier then. But we had to produce. Partly because

03:32.570 --> 03:41.468
in addition to the rivalry among research 
interests and scripts, there was also an intense

03:32.570 --> 03:41.468
rivalry between institutions. Like Scripps 
wanted to do a better job than Lamont in seismic

03:41.718 --> 03:50.193
refraction, or heat flow, or whatever it might be, 
or Woods Hole. And there was always that

03:51.395 --> 03:56.924
competition, I think, for the federal dollar 
going on at the institutions. I think that helped

03:56.984 --> 03:59.949
bring Oceania to being all great fast. Because 
these great men, Ravel, Ewing, and Islam, maybe,

04:03.655 --> 04:12.564
here, and Woods Hope, who was more a physical 
oceanographer, helped really get the thing

04:03.655 --> 04:12.564
going. They were the leaders. They were 
definitely leaders, something we don't see so

04:14.045 --> 04:24.475
much of anymore, either nationally or even in our 
institutions, I think, to some extent. We have

04:24.495 --> 04:28.479
directors, but not necessarily leaders. Right. 
Well, it might be, you know, that It's more

04:31.718 --> 04:40.246
difficult as the scholarly world has become more 
specialized to find someone with a broad-based

04:31.718 --> 04:40.246
background to lead an institution. I'm struck by 
your comments, for example, which appeared again

04:40.826 --> 04:49.534
and again in interviews, that each of you have 
become, in effect, more specialized, less of a

04:40.826 --> 04:49.534
general oceanographer. Would you agree with 
that? I think that's to some extent true. We

04:55.059 --> 05:01.084
haven't, hardly any of us, been able to keep up with 
all the new developments in oceanography. So in a

05:01.874 --> 05:07.222
relative sense, we've all become specialists to 
some extent. We may have been more generalists in

05:07.242 --> 05:11.668
the past just because there wasn't as much to know 
about. I think that's true. But I kind of started

05:13.130 --> 05:15.574
out as a specialist. I wasn't really a generalist 
like Ravel. I think he always tried to impress on us

05:20.621 --> 05:25.789
the need for being a general oceanographer. And 
all the courses that we took at Scripps were

05:26.343 --> 05:29.491
directed toward that way. We took courses in 
biology, physical oceanography, chemistry,

05:29.532 --> 05:35.969
geology, and geophysics. That was required of all 
students to take those at Scripps, as it is here,

05:35.989 --> 05:39.338
too. So we try to get every student at least get

05:49.023 --> 05:51.005
You didn't get involved with all the fields of 
research. You were in your own field, even at that

05:51.025 --> 05:55.531
time, 1956, when I started. I was a specialist in 
geology, geophysics of the oceans. And that

06:01.298 --> 06:10.168
perhaps limits one's abilities to comprehend all 
of oceanography. I think that's true. I feel that.

06:13.312 --> 06:16.576
So then you decided to leave Scripps and go to 
UNESCO. Yes. A career change. Sort of a career

06:18.841 --> 06:26.376
change, although I was always intending to do it as 
a temporary thing to see how I liked the

06:18.841 --> 06:26.376
administration of the ocean. This was an 
administrative job. I wasn't doing any more of my

06:28.881 --> 06:31.086
own research. I didn't pretend that I was going to 
do that for the next couple of years. I had a

06:33.931 --> 06:36.276
two-year appointment to get us going. And I 
thought that would help broaden me, and I think it

06:37.235 --> 06:48.732
did, to expose me to a lot of people working in 
oceanography, although it didn't expose me as

06:37.235 --> 06:48.732
much as I'd hoped to the working oceanographer. It 
exposed me to more of the administrator and the

06:48.752 --> 06:55.362
politician in oceanography. responsible for 
meetings of the IOC, the International

06:56.287 --> 07:10.532
Oceanographic Commission, in addition to 
carrying out a program of assisting countries in

06:56.287 --> 07:10.532
oceanographic research, maybe developing 
countries who are just getting their

06:56.287 --> 07:10.532
oceanographic programs started. I was one of four 
persons in that office.

07:19.321 --> 07:31.883
I had a Russian boss, Konstantin Fedorov, and a 
German and a Japanese colleague who worked with me

07:19.321 --> 07:31.883
in the office for those two years. Gahil Temple, 
who's now at Keel, and Takenuchi, who's somewhere

07:37.850 --> 07:41.434
in Japan now. I don't know where he is. 
Meteorological agency or something like that. He

07:45.138 --> 07:47.321
was a physical oceanographer. And I was a 
geologist, geophysicist, and Hempo was a

07:47.341 --> 07:52.207
biologist. And better off, our director was also a 
physical oceanographer. So I was the only

07:57.793 --> 07:59.675
geologist. But I got involved in all fields of 
oceanography in that department meeting,

08:01.157 --> 08:06.203
administratively. So the frustrating thing 
about UNESCO was that the time constant of doing

08:06.655 --> 08:21.618
things was so long that by the time I'd been there 
for two years, half the projects I started hadn't

08:06.655 --> 08:21.618
been finished. And I felt kind of frustrated in 
that. I enjoyed the time there and interacting

08:26.163 --> 08:35.934
with a lot of people, but I felt strongly the need to 
get back into my own research activity, too. So I

08:35.954 --> 08:48.770
decided in 1966 that I really had had enough of 
ministering oceanography on an international

08:35.954 --> 08:48.770
basis and I wanted to get back into my own research 
fields here in Woods Hole, which I did. And I got

08:50.712 --> 08:55.157
back here again into heat cell research and had had 
a fairly major program here for the past 10 or 12

08:55.795 --> 09:00.441
years, 10 or 11 years. How long have I been here? 
Sixty-six. Yeah, 11 years. And have been

09:06.550 --> 09:09.634
continuing that work here. And I, you know, it's 
been a very pleasant experience. When I look back

09:13.079 --> 09:16.664
on the time, it looks like, you know, what's 
happened to the past 20 years. I don't know. It's

09:17.445 --> 09:21.010
like, well, I think that's true of any field that 
you enjoy. And I've gotten myself involved with

09:21.243 --> 09:25.329
some other geophysical fields at the same time. 
Some electromagnetic induction research, which

09:26.110 --> 09:32.939
is a new kind of field coming along. We're getting 
that started here at Woods Hole. I've been

09:34.661 --> 09:36.604
involved with it for three or four years now. And 
that's directed to... looking at electrical

09:40.345 --> 09:52.621
conductivity in the oceans, beneath the oceans, 
as a function of depth, trying to understand what

09:40.345 --> 09:52.621
the temperature and chemical structure might be 
beneath the oceans. But you could see Woods Hole is

09:52.641 --> 10:02.094
similarly organized to Scripps, but not quite the 
same. The main differences are here, I think, that

10:03.075 --> 10:09.103
we tended partly from the characters of the people 
here, to be more tightly directed. That is, the

10:15.453 --> 10:23.048
geophysics department, partly for historical 
reasons, tended to do things as a group. We went out

10:23.689 --> 10:25.272
on cruises as a group. And I was in on some of these 
when I first came here, not so much lately. But you

10:29.941 --> 10:42.358
went to sea as a geophysics group rather than, as I 
mentioned in my first group of scripts, as

10:29.941 --> 10:42.358
physical oceanographers, geologists, 
biologists, et cetera. Tend to be more of a

10:42.378 --> 10:46.884
discipline oriented research group here. And we 
were just starting to get organized by

10:47.925 --> 10:53.232
departments here at Woods Hole. compared to 
Scripps, which had a long, long organization

10:53.498 --> 10:58.325
structure. I think Woods Hole is just somewhat 
behind in getting organized compared to Scripps.

11:04.313 --> 11:11.644
Woods Hole didn't exist before 1930, and Scripps 
existed way back until the early 1900s as a marine

11:04.313 --> 11:11.644
biological station. Almost all of the 
oceanographic institutions started off in

11:12.946 --> 11:16.010
biology. That's right. Which is interesting. 
Very few started out as geological institutions,

11:18.271 --> 11:24.740
with a few exceptions. I don't know how the others 
did. Anyway, I think now we're seeing a time of

11:28.445 --> 11:39.640
intense competition for research dollars right 
now. I'm feeling it. Everybody's feeling it. It's

11:44.326 --> 11:52.373
not quite so enjoyable as it used to be when you have 
to really beg for your dollars. But I think

11:54.475 --> 11:58.038
everybody here feels the enjoyment of working at 
sea. One thing I find here, I was at Scripps a couple

11:59.800 --> 12:04.685
of years ago on sabbatical. I just went back for a 
year to participate in some of these

12:04.705 --> 12:12.932
electromagnetic induction studies with Jim Cox 
at Scripps.

12:16.253 --> 12:24.943
with a separate group at Scripps, not very 
directed compared to one here, which might

12:16.253 --> 12:24.943
involve the whole of the physics department. But I 
found that one of the differences between here and

12:24.963 --> 12:41.282
Scripps was the

12:24.963 --> 12:41.282
way in which, how do I describe

12:24.963 --> 12:41.282
it? that Scripps is kind of a bigger place now that 
involves the whole university. And people are

12:50.964 --> 13:02.005
involved from the university in Scripps, and 
there's not so much emphasis on the seacoing part

12:50.964 --> 13:02.005
of things anymore in Scripps as it used to be. Here, 
there's a much more relative emphasis, I think, on

13:02.238 --> 13:07.383
the seagoing aspects of things. Perhaps because 
we're isolated down here on the Cape. We're not

13:10.366 --> 13:16.213
associated with a major university except with 
MIT in an educational sense. But we don't have any

13:16.233 --> 13:20.117
close physical ties with MIT. And our business is 
oceanography down here. That's it, period.

13:24.601 --> 13:26.203
That's the way we get funding. Whereas Scripps is 
sort of part now of the big UCSD campus and is more of

13:26.403 --> 13:33.350
a general campus. That's both an advantage and a 
disadvantage, because it means that you can't. We

13:38.215 --> 13:48.745
here at Woods Hole, for example, can't draw on the 
expertise quickly and easily from other fields,

13:38.215 --> 13:48.745
geophysics or physics, for example, or 
chemistry. We have to go to MIT or some other place

13:48.765 --> 13:53.710
to really get involved with people from those 
fields. On the other hand, it means we can be

13:54.668 --> 13:59.737
somewhat unfettered. We're not part of a large 
research or a large educational institution

13:59.757 --> 14:06.348
which has its rules and regulations. We're a 
fairly small institution. And fortunately, we

14:09.754 --> 14:15.243
have the ship facilities here that I think are as 
good as anywhere. Probably as good as scriptry and

14:15.263 --> 14:17.166
better. And that's been one of the very attractive 
things to me here at Woods Hole, is the emphasis on

14:17.922 --> 14:26.651
seagoing activity and keeping first-class 
seagoing activity going. Whereas I think Scripps

14:27.632 --> 14:35.800
has left their seagoing activity dropping, 
compared to what I saw when I was there 20 years ago.

14:35.820 --> 14:42.327
And that's unfortunate to some extent, because 
Scripps is a wonderful place to do seagoing work.

14:43.184 --> 14:48.570
But there are a lot of other institutions now that 
have come along in a much stronger way. Smaller

14:49.872 --> 15:04.129
institutions, but still quite viable ones, such 
as University of Hawaii, Texas A&M, University of

14:49.872 --> 15:04.129
Miami,

14:49.872 --> 15:04.129
and Duke University operates the Eastward. So I 
think the relative importance has changed

15:05.003 --> 15:12.444
between the smaller institutions and the larger 
institutions. And I think the smaller

15:12.464 --> 15:20.346
institutions have a relatively larger influence 
in hunk of the pie than they used to back in the old

15:12.464 --> 15:20.346
days. after World War II. It was mainly the major 
institutions where the World War II research was

15:22.196 --> 15:26.782
carried out. And that carried over into the 
funding, at least for a few years. Yes, I think so.

15:30.986 --> 15:33.670
That's the way I felt. So it's a more pluralistic 
kind of activity, divided among more

15:33.690 --> 15:43.221
institutions and more programs. I'm not involved 
with it, but Dave Ross down here runs the What

15:50.853 --> 15:54.779
am I trying to say?

15:58.084 --> 16:10.902
The Sea Grant program, which involves all kinds of 
applied aspects of research and is a very potent

15:58.084 --> 16:10.902
force now in new avenues for oceanographic 
research that are more applied. I guess I'm still a

16:12.124 --> 16:16.390
basic oceanographic research scientist. I don't 
get so much involved with the applied aspects. And

16:19.473 --> 16:31.632
I think Woods Hole is still a basic research 
institution, although there have been a lot of

16:19.473 --> 16:31.632
pressures lately to get involved with applied 
research, and even from the director on down here.

16:31.832 --> 16:33.695
And that's where the new funding is. I think we're 
always tempted to get involved with more applied

16:33.715 --> 16:39.264
kind of research programs. But I don't think 
anyone claims yet that we know enough about the

16:39.284 --> 16:44.552
basic fundamentals of how the ocean works or how 
the earth works to say that we can just do applied

16:45.022 --> 16:52.934
work now. At least I don't feel that way, and I don't 
think very many people do. I think Woods Hole and

16:56.219 --> 17:05.854
Scripps and Lamont still have a basic research 
orientation, and they're going to contribute a

16:56.219 --> 17:05.854
lot to these applied programs that are going on 
now. I don't know how much detail you want on what my

17:05.874 --> 17:12.244
history has been here at Woods Hole. or who I've 
known here. Well, now, what I'd like for you to do

17:14.609 --> 17:22.339
now is, now you're reentering work with heat flow. 
I'd like for you to talk some about what you did when

17:22.359 --> 17:27.746
you arrived, how you set up your research. What do 
you feel as if you discovered in heat flow? How do

17:32.292 --> 17:37.219
you feel like this contributed to the idea of 
spreading? What was your reaction when you began

17:37.619 --> 17:42.045
to see the implication of the two? Yeah, this 
happened, the idea of seafloor spreading and

17:42.886 --> 17:53.823
plate tectonics, which is sort of the revolution 
in our field, really happened about the time I was

17:42.886 --> 17:53.823
over in UNESCO. And I was getting some feedback 
from that in the indirect sort of way, but I wasn't

17:55.045 --> 18:07.425
involved directly with, at the time, with the 
research that was developing then. You know, the

18:07.912 --> 18:12.681
real evidence came from the magnetic anomalies on 
the seafloor. And that came out with Fred Vine and

18:12.701 --> 18:21.557
others about 1965, 1966 period, just when I was 
coming back here to Woods Hole. And so that was sort

18:21.577 --> 18:30.072
of a stimulus for us in the geothermal aspects of 
things to try to understand what was happening to

18:30.575 --> 18:32.578
the heat flow. Could the heat flow be explained in 
the same way? And we knew in a general sense that it

18:35.503 --> 18:40.050
could, because we found these high heat flow 
values on ridges. But we didn't understand all the

18:41.052 --> 18:43.496
scattering values. We had a lot of scattering heat 
flow data, and still do. And it's only the past few

18:47.302 --> 18:52.971
years where we started to understand the cause of 
that

18:53.542 --> 18:55.806
models of hydrothermal circulation. There's 
water circulating down in the crust where the

18:55.946 --> 19:06.204
rocks, when they're formed at the ridges, get 
pretty well cracked up, probably thermally or

18:55.946 --> 19:06.204
mechanically. So water can circulate down in the 
rocks and bring the heat out. And we don't measure

19:09.970 --> 19:14.638
that with our measurements because we measure 
only the conductive part of the heat. And so where

19:15.631 --> 19:22.542
we had conductive measurements, we'd get both 
high and low values scattered very close

19:15.631 --> 19:22.542
together. We could never understand why that 
should exist on the sea floor. Because

19:26.389 --> 19:33.420
theoretically, if everything were conducted, we 
should get a uniform decrease of heat flow away

19:26.389 --> 19:33.420
from the ridges as the crust cools. We didn't find 
that. So heat flow was not a major contributor to

19:35.257 --> 19:41.283
the development of the idea of sea floor spread. We 
had problems and still do have problems

19:41.983 --> 19:47.548
understanding the distribution of heat flow. But 
it has contributed more recently in a major way to

19:47.568 --> 19:58.297
the models of the way the plates cool with time. 
Because by eliminating, yeah,

20:14.980 --> 20:24.353
of the circulating, what we infer to be a 
circulating pattern of water in the earth's crust

20:14.980 --> 20:24.353
in that area. And we've mapped very detailed, 
small-scale variations of heat flow there, which

20:25.454 --> 20:37.731
can explain easily all of the scatter that we've 
been measuring in the past 20 years, especially in

20:25.454 --> 20:37.731
the ridge crust. There's a lot of interesting 
aspects of that that I don't think I need to go into

20:38.757 --> 20:50.533
now here, but that we're trying to develop an 
understanding of that hydrothermal circulation

20:38.757 --> 20:50.533
pattern. But we're also trying to understand the 
basic cooling of the plates now as a function of

20:50.553 --> 21:00.546
time out to as old as the oceans get. We haven't done 
that very well. There's still a lot of scatter in

21:02.897 --> 21:07.684
the data because of the way the data was taken in the 
early days. So we're developing a lot of very

21:07.704 --> 21:23.808
specific experiments to understand the heat flow 
as a function of age of the ocean crust so we can get a

21:07.704 --> 21:23.808
smooth curve that's connected with the aging of 
the plates with time. And that hasn't been easy

21:23.828 --> 21:30.398
because in the early days, right after sea floor 
spreading, I think heat flow tended to be

21:30.665 --> 21:35.531
discounted a lot because it wasn't understood. We 
didn't understand this aspect of hydrothermal

21:35.932 --> 21:40.197
circulation until about the early 1970s. So 
essentially, when I first came back here to Woods

21:41.399 --> 21:52.673
Hole, we were making these long transects for 
several years of heat flow right across the

21:41.399 --> 21:52.673
oceans. And it clearly demonstrated that the heat 
flow measurements couldn't fit very well to an

21:53.108 --> 22:04.794
idea of sea floor spreading, cooling of a plate in a 
simple mode.

22:06.418 --> 22:12.552
But I think these measurements were instrumental 
in helping us develop this idea of hydrothermal

22:12.970 --> 22:23.460
circulation in the crust, a mechanism which had 
been suspected and not really demonstrated in any

22:12.970 --> 22:23.460
clear way, except by heat flow measurements. 
Recently, I think this work on the Galapagos has

22:23.480 --> 22:28.145
demonstrated it fairly clearly that it holds 
pretty well. We measured hot water coming out of

22:28.345 --> 22:34.832
the crust, for example, with Albin in a very 
detailed survey right at the ridge crest. The

22:35.953 --> 22:41.458
Galapagos was an interesting place to go to 
because not only the historical aspects

22:42.181 --> 22:45.145
associated with Darwin's discoveries there. We 
also discovered some new biology on the seafloor

22:45.685 --> 23:00.663
associated with these fins, which is 
interesting, because Darwin discovered a new

22:45.685 --> 23:00.663
biology on the islands there, and the biological 
principles that he expounded in terms of

22:45.685 --> 23:00.663
evolution and things of this sort. Now the marine 
biologists are very interested in these new

23:00.683 --> 23:05.549
discoveries on the seafloor in the same area. It's 
kind of an interesting connection. So a return to

23:07.852 --> 23:08.833
history. Return to history, so to speak. But we 
don't know very much about that biology yet. The

23:14.769 --> 23:23.697
biologists are really excited now and want to get 
back to the area in another year or two with the

23:14.769 --> 23:23.697
Alvin submersible to look at things. Alvin is a new 
technology that's come along, too, very nicely in

23:23.717 --> 23:28.502
the past few years. Essentially, Woods Hole took 
on the burden about when I came back here, a little

23:29.823 --> 23:41.314
before I arrived here, of supporting the research 
submersible vessel that could be used by anyone

23:41.648 --> 24:05.330
who wanted to use it in the oceanographic 
community had a tough time for a long time

23:41.648 --> 24:05.330
supporting that kind of activity because it 
simply didn't have the capabilities to get down to

23:41.648 --> 24:05.330
the deep sea floor where the interesting geology 
and geophysics occurred until recently. It

24:05.870 --> 24:11.115
increased its depth capability three, four years 
ago to 12,000 feet instead of 6,000. 6,000 feet

24:11.095 --> 24:16.242
eliminated this from all the oceans, except for 
the continental shelves. There were very few

24:17.063 --> 24:20.667
people that could do much with the outland on the 
continental shelves. Well, there were people

24:20.687 --> 24:26.495
here, sedimentologists and geologists, who were 
using it and did use it. Ken Emery, Dave Ross, and

24:26.515 --> 24:33.143
other people used it on the shelves here. But, you 
know, it turns out the new, all the driving And a lot

24:37.117 --> 24:43.707
of the driving force, I think, for big funding in 
oceanography came from the geological,

24:37.117 --> 24:43.707
geophysical side of things in the deep oceans. It 
still does to some extent. I don't think our

24:46.831 --> 24:50.316
revolution has stopped yet, really. Because now 
we're working on the problems of understanding

24:50.337 --> 24:58.228
the driving forces associated with plate 
tectonics. What makes it go? And we know very

25:00.311 --> 25:01.994
little about it right now. And we're now 
developing some long, deep penetrating

25:06.901 --> 25:18.680
experiments, one of which is this 
electromagnetic induction studies that I'm

25:06.901 --> 25:18.680
starting to get into, to learn about the depth 
structure of the plates and beneath the plates.

25:18.980 --> 25:21.023
What's the material beneath the plates like? How 
does it distribute in space and over the motions?

25:26.532 --> 25:27.293
That's just beginning. I think that's going to be a 
new story for the next 10 or 15 years. Do you think

25:31.201 --> 25:38.711
that'll, at least in terms of your interest and 
specialty, you think that'll be the direction of

25:31.201 --> 25:38.711
oceanography? That'll be one direction of 
oceanography. I think we're going to see several

25:41.415 --> 25:45.020
directions in oceanography over the next few 
years. I think it's perhaps like the

25:45.060 --> 25:52.330
proliferation of the field itself. We're going to 
see several major directions in oceanography.

25:56.095 --> 25:56.736
What are they? Well, one is associated with the 
ocean waters themselves. The physical

26:00.796 --> 26:20.310
oceanographers are sort of having a revolution by 
themselves right now in terms of understanding

26:00.796 --> 26:20.310
the details of the circulating patterns of 
currents in the oceans and the time scales of the

26:00.796 --> 26:20.310
circulations and the flow of energy, sort of the 
climate in the ocean, so to speak, and the way it

26:00.796 --> 26:20.310
interacts with the climate in the atmosphere. I 
think there's a lot of evidence now that the

26:21.421 --> 26:31.661
oceans' distribution of temperatures and ocean 
waters controls what happens over the

26:21.421 --> 26:31.661
continents. Yes. To a large extent, you probably 
talk to people at Scripps about this, because

26:32.342 --> 26:43.564
they're very much involved with that, because it 
looks like the Pacific Ocean is probably the

26:32.342 --> 26:43.564
controlling factor on the weather over the United 
States.

26:56.487 --> 27:02.333
of these new biological communities in the 
Galapagos. What do those mean in terms of

27:02.613 --> 27:06.558
evolution of creatures on the seafloor? These 
vents that were observed, hot water vents on the

27:07.138 --> 27:14.206
Galapagos, are only a few thousand years old. And 
here we have new creatures that have probably been

27:14.226 --> 27:22.895
developed there in this period of a few thousand 
years that don't exist elsewhere outside of those

27:14.226 --> 27:22.895
areas. How did they develop? Where did they come 
from? How do they get introduced? How do they live?

27:27.943 --> 27:30.206
What do they live on down there? There's a lot of 
theories going around right now about sulfur

27:30.226 --> 27:38.297
reducing bacteria and how they contribute to the 
food chain at the seafloor from these vent areas.

27:39.699 --> 27:51.214
It may be very localized, but they may have some 
long ranging aspects or implications for the

27:39.699 --> 27:51.214
development of sea life in the ocean. I don't know. 
That's a story that biologists need to tell, and I

27:52.968 --> 27:56.493
think probably will be taught. And then in our 
field, in geological oceanography, I think the

27:57.274 --> 28:07.827
big push is going to be to understand the driving 
forces behind plate tectonics. What are the

28:07.847 --> 28:10.451
deeper motions that are going on? How fast are 
they? How are they distributed? Do we have big

28:13.074 --> 28:15.577
convection cells under the Earth? Where are they? 
What is their time scale? What drives these

28:21.740 --> 28:24.502
motions in the air? Is it heat coming from the 
interior that drives them? If so, why? Where are

28:31.028 --> 28:32.649
the heat sources in the air? These will be 
difficult problems to get at. We may not be able to

28:35.692 --> 28:41.117
answer them unambiguously because we can't get 
down there and sample things. 100 kilometers

28:41.137 --> 28:43.659
down, how are we going to sample it? But the tools we 
have are geophysical. Heat flow,

28:47.202 --> 28:50.785
electromagnetic, seismic, All of these indirect 
methods are going to be the ways in which we learn

28:51.153 --> 29:01.867
about this, and I suspect I'm going to be involved 
with that probably for the rest of my career here in

28:51.153 --> 29:01.867
oceanography. So, in a sense, my early heat flow 
work is being generalized into a more broader

29:01.887 --> 29:12.540
geophysical description of how the Earth works. 
I've been studying it in the oceans, peripherally

29:13.482 --> 29:20.130
on the continents, but I think that's... the 
relationship we see now. And we want to tie the

29:22.230 --> 29:25.918
oceans and the continents together when we make 
this kind of a study. How do the continental masses

29:26.739 --> 29:33.974
react to these sea floor spreading forces that are 
going on? It may turn out that a lot of the activity

29:39.196 --> 29:46.908
or organization of research in the oceans will be 
now applied to the continents. The continents are

29:47.309 --> 29:55.301
much more difficult to understand in many ways, 
even though we're living right on top of them and

29:47.309 --> 29:55.301
have access to them. So it may be that many of these 
geophysical methods, big geophysical programs,

29:55.321 --> 30:04.495
can now be applied to continental areas to 
understand the deep structure there.
