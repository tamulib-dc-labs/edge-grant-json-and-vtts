WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:08.917
And we're in 209 Francis Hall, getting ready to 
chat with Les Reed. Les, check yours. I think

00:10.620 --> 00:12.504
mine's probably at a good level.

00:16.633 --> 00:24.368
Les, for the sake of the person who may listen to 
this tape or read the transcription many years

00:16.633 --> 00:24.368
from now, Let's begin by asking you to summarize 
your biography before you came here. Where did you

00:31.309 --> 00:32.109
grow up? Where did you study? What were you doing 
before you came to A&M? Well, okay, Haskell, I was a

00:38.335 --> 00:41.618
depression baby. I was born just in May of 29, just 
four or five months before the October crash. And

00:50.045 --> 00:52.548
so that influenced the early childhood. However, 
I was born in Niagara Falls, New York, of parents

00:53.795 --> 01:02.326
who were both native born and naturalized. My 
mother was a naturalized Canadian. And

01:05.750 --> 01:12.999
consequently, my people were pretty heavily 
Scotch-Canadian.

01:14.581 --> 01:23.633
Being in Niagara Falls, my early childhood was 
influenced by tourism and parks and overlooks and

01:14.581 --> 01:23.633
all the trappings that go with that. and a father 
that was heavily oriented toward the outdoors and

01:24.102 --> 01:29.208
sports. So my youth was spent from cub scouting and 
boy scouting and adventure scouting and Canadian

01:29.829 --> 01:53.198
family vacations every year to enjoy that sort of 
thing, which after my dad was moved by the DuPont

01:29.829 --> 01:53.198
Company to manage

01:29.829 --> 01:53.198
a chemical plant in suburban downriver detroit 
michigan we moved there and i was about twelve

01:54.730 --> 02:22.881
junior high school age and completed high 
schooling uh... there in michigan hated the

01:54.730 --> 02:22.881
industrial side of life wanted to be an 
outdoorsman escaped from home wanted to go as far

01:54.730 --> 02:22.881
away as i could and still pay in-state tuition so i 
ended up at the forestry school in the upper

01:54.730 --> 02:22.881
peninsula michigan michigan technological 
colleges it was called at that Michigan College of

02:23.418 --> 02:52.935
Mines had been its original name famous mining 
school and very briefly from Michigan Tech got out

02:23.418 --> 02:52.935
just during the start of the Korean War went into 
the Army into the Signal Corps enlisted actually

02:23.418 --> 02:52.935
for two years which was possible at that time which 
I was told was a better deal than being conscripted

02:23.418 --> 02:52.935
and going in as a draftee So I enlisted for two 
years, never got to Korea, ended up teaching in the

02:53.422 --> 03:01.589
Department of Electricity at the US Military 
Academy at West Point. Don't know how that

03:03.091 --> 03:04.212
happened. Knew very little about electricity 
when I went in, hardly enough to change a light

03:04.352 --> 03:08.535
bulb. Would have been one of that good Aggie team 
that changes light bulbs. But in any event,

03:12.919 --> 03:15.622
completed my service there. Came out and went 
right back to college

03:16.923 --> 03:22.888
with a newly born baby. girl as a way to get back into 
the job market and majored there in the college of

03:23.797 --> 03:49.585
agriculture and municipal park administration

03:23.797 --> 03:49.585
worked as city forester and deputy park 
commissioner in topeka kansas for a couple years

03:23.797 --> 03:49.585
after graduation loved it but decided there was a 
lot more i wanted to know and and ended up being

03:49.767 --> 03:57.057
invited to come back and teach at Michigan State as 
long as I would work on a doctorate. Well, I agreed

03:57.077 --> 04:06.611
to that, went back there I think in 57, and ended up 
taking two doctorates, partly. The first I was

04:06.971 --> 04:13.841
allowed to take as a full-time faculty member a 
course a semester. So I took about four years in the

04:13.861 --> 04:16.585
wildlife department which was a related 
agriculture field until i had a slight rupture

04:18.067 --> 04:47.466
with the current department head in wildlife and i 
remember being dumb as dirt i told him he was only

04:18.067 --> 04:47.466
interested in the minutia of bass and bunnies and 
couldn't see the larger aspects of of urban

04:18.067 --> 04:47.466
recreation needs got thrown out of there and 
transferred what i could to the university of

04:18.067 --> 04:47.466
michigan and ended up with a PhD in National 
Conservation Policy.

04:55.437 --> 05:00.023
After, what's between Michigan and A&M, in terms 
of your experience? Well, nothing, because I was

05:00.043 --> 05:12.238
still, by a very hard-nosed but lovable Dean of 
Agriculture, allowed to maintain a quarter-time

05:00.043 --> 05:12.238
appointment at Michigan State, and the bulk of my 
doctorate time was funded by the outdoor

05:13.096 --> 05:40.167
recreation resources review commission in 
Washington DC that was making a nationwide study

05:13.096 --> 05:40.167
and in fact that financed my PhD I traveled the 
highway back and forth the 60 some miles between

05:13.096 --> 05:40.167
Michigan State and the University of Michigan 
with my textbooks on the steering wheel and

05:13.096 --> 05:40.167
another job part-time in in my hometown of 
Wyandotte working for the city as an urban

05:13.096 --> 05:40.167
forester

05:41.345 --> 06:05.479
Terrible way to live a life trying to maintain a 
family at the same time had two children by then But

05:41.345 --> 06:05.479
anyway intended to stay at Michigan State for the 
rest of my life got the doctorate in 63 In 65

05:41.345 --> 06:05.479
in the spring I was taking a regional field tour in a 
varsity bus and with a group of students

06:06.370 --> 06:08.513
throughout the Northeast. We hit the Garment 
District in New York. We hit Washington, D.C. We

06:11.057 --> 06:16.284
were in the Smokies.

06:17.486 --> 06:26.118
And I was getting repeated phone calls from the 
campus saying somebody was desperate to talk to me

06:17.486 --> 06:26.118
about moving to Texas to a college there. And I kept 
putting them off, saying, look, I'm busy. I've got

06:29.443 --> 06:32.688
problems here with students, and we're on a tight 
schedule. I'll talk to them when I get back. I think

06:35.024 --> 06:37.908
that was in June or July. When I got back to the 
campus, it turned out to be Dr. R.C. Potts, Dick

06:44.016 --> 06:51.325
Potts, who had called me and repeatedly inviting 
me to come down. I'd been nominated by some folks as

06:51.385 --> 07:03.040
a candidate for a head of a brand new department 
that President Rutter wanted to establish.

07:03.847 --> 07:07.571
that they're urging, decided to come down, take a 
look, had very little interest in it.

07:10.594 --> 07:17.822
Came back from that visit, my wife met me at the 
airport in Ann Arbor, and I said, she said, what do

07:10.594 --> 07:17.822
you think? And I said, it's the smallest little 
sidewalk nothing town you ever saw in your life.

07:24.149 --> 07:25.631
She said, do you want to do it? And I said, yeah. I 
said, look, it means tearing us up, but we'll only

07:27.873 --> 07:32.318
have to stay a year or two if we don't like it. And the 
thing that Haskell really persuaded me to come was

07:33.682 --> 07:42.009
the personality and the charisma of General 
Rutter. Describe that as best you can. How was that

07:45.913 --> 07:48.175
demonstrated? Well, you have to remember, when I 
was here that first year, I think there were like

07:49.116 --> 08:02.828
7,700 students here, almost all in the Corps, no 
women, except a few hardship cases, as they were

07:49.116 --> 08:02.828
called, who's... Family had petitioned the 
president and said, look, it would be a hardship on

08:03.466 --> 08:11.417
us economically for my little girl to go anywhere 
else. Would you take her in? So we had a few grad

08:12.358 --> 08:19.067
students, but largely it was a ROTC-uniformed 
campus. I was at Michigan State, which was a big 10

08:20.189 --> 08:26.698
power and probably 22,000 students at that time. I 
had all my contacts, all my connections, my

08:27.439 --> 08:30.503
network. professionally was in the Lake States. I 
knew nothing about southern trees or environment

08:33.320 --> 08:41.208
or dirty muddy rivers and so it looked like a big 
jump. Dr. Potts met me at the airport. It was in

08:45.714 --> 08:46.555
August. I had no idea about Texas heat. I never knew 
it was hot here because he had a little underdash

08:51.000 --> 08:57.587
air conditioning unit a bolt-on unit in his car he 
had it turned up all the way i never knew it was hot

08:57.770 --> 09:23.710
here i remember going back he took me to hobby 
airport in houston when my interview visit was

08:57.770 --> 09:23.710
over and the the rotating bank temperature on one 
of the banks down there in houston said 96 and i said

08:57.770 --> 09:23.710
i can't believe it and i opened the window and stuck 
my arm out the window and almost fried But they had

09:24.162 --> 09:30.672
kept me so much in air conditioning during my visit 
that I didn't know how hot it was. Actually, the

09:30.832 --> 09:41.789
recruitment I did later on in years was always to 
try and go after northern profs in February for the

09:30.832 --> 09:41.789
same reason anybody wanted to get out of the north 
at that time of year. So anyway, getting back to

09:43.511 --> 09:50.642
General Rutter,

09:43.511 --> 09:50.642
because Michigan State was a large campus, I saw 
John Hanna, who was the beloved president of that

09:51.466 --> 10:02.542
university, and we all adored him, maybe once a 
year in a reception line for a scant couple of

09:51.466 --> 10:02.542
seconds. I came down here to this school, and among 
all of the places that Dr. Potts shepherded me to,

10:03.984 --> 10:14.219
one was a meeting with President Rutter. And I went 
in his top floor office in the systems building,

10:22.347 --> 10:25.070
and had a wonderful conversation with him. He was 
pleasant and easy to talk to, told me some of his

10:25.090 --> 10:32.018
dreams for the school and what he wanted A&M to 
become. And after about an hour, as I remember, as

10:32.078 --> 10:50.380
we got up to leave, he walked me to his office door, 
put an arm around my shoulder, and said, Les, I

10:32.078 --> 10:50.380
really need you to come here and help me do this 
thing. And I melted. That's how Jesus' disciples

10:52.339 --> 10:57.366
must have felt. I'll follow you anywhere. I'll do 
anything to be with you. And that's what I told my

11:00.550 --> 11:05.677
wife, is that I really want to do this. Did he seem 
genuinely concerned about recreation and parks?

11:12.125 --> 11:13.667
He didn't know what he was talking about. 
Actually, he told me about his background as land

11:15.740 --> 11:26.336
commissioner and a drug store owner in Brady and 
things of that kind and not much about his Army

11:15.740 --> 11:26.336
experience. I found out that later what a hero he 
was. But his idea was that recreation was

11:30.542 --> 11:45.004
something that his neighbors and landowners 
could profit from and benefit from as an

11:45.659 --> 12:09.355
additional use of their land during hard times 
when you know cow prices and sheep were down

11:45.659 --> 12:09.355
through hunting privileges and so he kind of saw 
outdoor recreation quote unquote as farm hunting

11:45.659 --> 12:09.355
more like a fish and wildlife ranger following 
that same thread Did you know then or do you know now

12:10.060 --> 12:17.109
who originated the idea of creating such a 
program? Yeah. Yeah, Dr. Chuck Leinweber,

12:19.192 --> 12:23.598
Charles Leinweber of Enrange Science. As a matter 
of fact, he had been for a couple of years under Dean

12:24.339 --> 12:38.498
Patterson, Dean of Agriculture, been carrying a 
few students that wanted to specialize in outdoor

12:24.339 --> 12:38.498
resource management. And that was the unusual 
thing about what Rudder was proposing to me, which

12:39.575 --> 12:57.420
was that Dean Patterson had set up a 
multi-department committee to recommend to him

12:39.575 --> 12:57.420
how to deal with this thing. And rather than build 
it as an adjunct out of range science, decided to

12:58.301 --> 13:06.713
make it a separate department along with range in 
wildlife and forestry, because that's the

13:07.267 --> 13:13.116
typical pattern in land grant schools around the 
country. And so Lineweber was kind of the

13:14.498 --> 13:32.987
nursemaid to that situation, and they went out and 
looked at candidates and somehow or other, I guess

13:14.498 --> 13:32.987
I'd been somewhat visible through this National 
ARC research study and had published in that, they

13:14.498 --> 13:32.987
decided to take a look at me. Things all go 
together, I think, according to God's will,

13:34.908 --> 13:50.291
because the time I'd spend at the military 
academy, watching the cadets marching on the

13:34.908 --> 13:50.291
plane and all that kind of stuff, it seemed like 
coming home to come to A&M in a way. And so the idea

13:51.452 --> 14:01.287
for Milan Weber, through the dean, through Vice 
President Wayne Hall and Rudder, As far as you were

14:01.739 --> 14:04.863
aware, everybody had signed on. Creation of this 
brand new department. And what was it called at

14:07.486 --> 14:11.610
organization time? Recreation and Parks. 
Recreation and Parks. But it included what we

14:16.796 --> 14:20.701
today might call also tourism? No. Did not? No. It 
was largely conceived as an adjunct to a game

14:23.524 --> 14:29.451
warden kind of program. That's originally what I 
think General Rudder was looking at,

14:30.559 --> 14:42.753
specializing in recreation, but in a very farm 
outdoor hunting kind of arrangement. And what did

14:42.773 --> 14:52.464
they offer you in terms of resources to build this 
department, to create it?

14:55.668 --> 14:58.071
Nobody offered me anything except for President 
Rutter and as we left he said if you come and if

14:58.372 --> 15:28.362
you'll give me the top national program in the 
country you'll have a blank check as long as I'm

14:58.372 --> 15:28.362
here and you know the interesting thing Haskell is 
that being young and inexperienced I bought that

14:58.372 --> 15:28.362
but it could have been all fluff it could have been 
very insincere I could have come and been a single

14:58.372 --> 15:28.362
prof working and frustrated the rest of my life 
with none of that And there wouldn't be anything

15:28.730 --> 15:30.793
you could do about it. But he was absolutely 100% 
committed to this thing. Right. When you got at

15:35.460 --> 15:52.165
some point in writing an offer of employment, did 
that offer include any promises about the

15:35.460 --> 15:52.165
department's creation in terms of resources and 
so forth? They said no. Dean Patterson, through

15:54.582 --> 16:02.812
Dick Potts, who was the chief negotiator with me, 
said that we will do our best to find you space.

16:02.832 --> 16:04.054
We're very tight on space. That hasn't changed 
much, has it, over the years? And the salary they

16:07.398 --> 16:16.489
offered me was $11,000 a year on a 12-month basis, 
which was about...

16:19.523 --> 16:26.432
I think I was at $8,600 a year or something like that 
in 1965 at Michigan State at that time. So it was a

16:26.452 --> 16:29.417
very, very healthy increase. Plus we figured the 
cost of living might be somewhat less here. It was a

16:32.641 --> 16:34.904
wrench leaving all our family and relatives. But 
we thought for a few years it wouldn't be such a bad

16:35.004 --> 16:39.811
deal. Incidentally, my reporting time was to be 
December of 65. Before that time came, I got a

16:47.603 --> 17:01.803
letter from the Ag Dean's office and found that my 
starting salary had increased, without me being

16:47.603 --> 17:01.803
there, from $11,000 to $11,800. Incredible.

17:04.847 --> 17:12.598
Because some of those first few years were very 
good as President Rutter tried to raise the

17:04.847 --> 17:12.598
salaries. commensurate with other places and in 
order to attract good faculty. He was on a real push

17:16.908 --> 17:22.436
to get out of state faculty. In fact, I have to tell 
you a little anecdote. I sent a resume when they

17:25.740 --> 17:34.713
asked me if I was interested in being considered 
for this job of department head of a new

17:25.740 --> 17:34.713
department. I sent a resume. In those days, come on 
now, five we had no computers available

17:39.157 --> 18:08.134
everything was done on stencils and typewriter 
and i sent a copy of my resume in my in my military

17:39.157 --> 18:08.134
experience i listed my highest rank because i had 
always been in a school company been in the signal

17:39.157 --> 18:08.134
corps been in this been in that school advanced 
microwave theory and finally teaching at west

17:39.157 --> 18:08.134
point i listed corporal which was my highest rank, 
Corporal, U.S. Army Signal Corps, U.S. Military

18:08.367 --> 18:14.855
Academy, West Point. And I realized years later, 
because of the copying techniques that we used, it

18:16.137 --> 18:22.124
looked like what? Colonel. Colonel, C-O-L, not 
C-P-L. And I told Dorothy, that's probably the

18:23.065 --> 18:35.961
only reason I got the position was, you know, most 
of the senior people on this campus were retired

18:23.065 --> 18:35.961
military. And so Colonel from West Point, that 
can't be too bad. He'll fit right in.

18:43.126 --> 18:43.727
All right. Surely, as you move down here, there 
must be one or two good stories about the

18:44.548 --> 18:54.237
experiences of moving from Michigan to Texas with 
a young family and all your belongings. Well, we

18:55.018 --> 19:01.484
had everything other than having a Mayflower van 
that was following us. But we left there the day

19:01.544 --> 19:03.906
after Christmas. in a howling snowstorm and went 
to pay one last visit to my Niagara Falls relatives

19:05.033 --> 19:11.804
from Detroit. So we crossed into Canada.

19:15.970 --> 19:24.083
In Biggie Munn's car, I had bought his big Dodge 880 
station wagon with the thought of going to Texas.

19:24.143 --> 19:26.367
Just happened he had turned it in and I bought it. So 
we had it loaded to the gills, and the Ontario

19:26.937 --> 19:36.533
Provincial Police stopped me and said, young man, 
do you realize that you're going 60 miles an hour,

19:26.937 --> 19:36.533
and it's icy and slippery? And I just had transfer 
plates on it, so they didn't know where I was from.

19:42.663 --> 19:46.309
So he let me go when I assured him that I knew how to 
drive on ice and snow. But that was the weather we

19:46.429 --> 19:49.975
left. two days later, we were driving down through 
Elvis Presley's hometown, Tupelo, Mississippi,

19:50.225 --> 20:08.490
shedding all of our parkas and heavy coats, and the 
kids were sweltering in the car, and got into

19:50.225 --> 20:08.490
Brian, and the roses were still blooming. So that 
was the change in scenery that took place that

20:08.510 --> 20:13.577
December. Where were you first officed? Where 
would your first First office they gave me was in

20:18.743 --> 20:24.570
the plant science building on the third floor. 
Golly, I can't remember the name, Haskell, of the

20:26.873 --> 20:36.325
terrible crotchety old individual in 
horticulture that was one of the best teachers

20:26.873 --> 20:36.325
they ever had. And you were identified as head of 
the department. Head of the department with one

20:43.434 --> 20:45.477
office. One office, and you were the only faculty 
member. I was the only faculty member. In a week, I

20:50.852 --> 20:55.802
interviewed a secretary. They gave me a second 
office, so I was the secretary. These were little

20:58.708 --> 21:01.994
offices, about 10 by 12. And so I had one office 
there. I was a horticulture prof. This was a

21:08.015 --> 21:14.789
dead-end hall with four small suites, four small 
offices in the suite. So I had a department

21:17.033 --> 21:27.394
secretary in the next office in the storage room 
across from her, and I went to a Southwest Regional

21:28.066 --> 21:38.339
Park and Recreation Training Institute at Lake 
Texoma that was sponsored yearly by Texas Tech's

21:28.066 --> 21:38.339
park management curriculum. And found a young man 
there who was very unhappy with the PhD program he

21:39.500 --> 21:48.471
was in at LSNU. and persuaded him to come with me to 
transfer his program. We had no PhD. We had no

21:57.402 --> 21:58.423
master's. But we had good connections with 
Charles Leidenweber, who was still nurse-mating

21:58.803 --> 22:05.970
our few graduate students. And he did. He came as an 
instructor, got him appointed. And I have to tell

22:12.736 --> 22:16.740
you a little anecdote about my student body. Got in 
there, got unpacking. that first few days

22:20.868 --> 22:35.812
carrying stuff up from the car, and a young fella 
came in in uniform with his cap in his hand, said,

22:20.868 --> 22:35.812
sir, I understand this is going to be Parks and 
Recreation. I said, well, Recreation and Parks,

22:36.032 --> 22:37.895
yeah. He said, I want to be in this department. And 
he was a transfer,

22:49.960 --> 23:13.977
he became my first student i said if you'll help me 
shelve some of these books get them out of the boxes

22:49.960 --> 23:13.977
and hand them to me i'll talk to you about this as we 
go he's he was here he was recognized as our

22:49.960 --> 23:13.977
outstanding student from years back he has just 
this year been appointed as the director of state

22:49.960 --> 23:13.977
parks in texas after a 25-year career in the 
national park services that's called the chief

23:14.615 --> 23:43.913
ranger that's the only one in the united states 
he's chief of all the rangers in all the national

23:14.615 --> 23:43.913
parks so he's had a brilliant career and now he's 
back as director of texas state parks but we

23:14.615 --> 23:43.913
shelved those books and he told me last week he 
still remembers the picture i hung on the wall

23:14.615 --> 23:43.913
which was a log cabin in the woods with snow deep all 
around it and pine trees towering over and he said

23:14.615 --> 23:43.913
that's the way i want to live my life But he was in 
danger of failing out. He had about a D average. And

23:49.164 --> 23:53.209
this was a last gasp chance for him to find out 
something that he liked. And the rest of that

23:53.970 --> 24:07.287
spring semester, Haskell, he was in frequently 
with some shave-headed friend out of his company

23:53.970 --> 24:07.287
saying, sir, here's another boy that needs to be 
with us in our department. And by the end of the

24:08.308 --> 24:13.174
semester, we had, I think, 17 majors. Dick Potts 
had told me now when you get down here we don't want

24:14.183 --> 24:38.942
you to teach in the spring semester we I want you to 
travel learn about the states Michigan had 83

24:14.183 --> 24:38.942
counties Texas has 254 spread all over and he said 
you need to become familiar with the towns and the

24:14.183 --> 24:38.942
resources and the way people think down here well I 
didn't I was so hungry to get teaching that between

24:39.665 --> 24:44.670
my first instructor and I, we taught four courses 
that first semester. When did you go through the

24:46.392 --> 24:58.525
red tape routine of getting a degree program 
authorized by the Coordinating Board and so

24:46.392 --> 24:58.525
forth? Constantly. Never stopped. I think that, 
well, the bachelor's was approved.

25:11.660 --> 25:14.404
Was the Masters approved initially? Ashworth, 
his name sticks in my mind. No, prior to him it was

25:20.572 --> 25:30.005
Reed, R-E-E-D, who I always call Sheepstealers, 
but that's here and there. Anyway,

25:30.686 --> 25:37.836
I still have some of the proposals that I wrote for 
the advanced degrees. One thing they had promised

25:41.018 --> 25:45.784
me was that they would do everything possible to 
get all three degrees. I said, if we're going to be

25:45.884 --> 25:50.069
first class in the country, we have to have a 
terminal degree. And without General Rutter,

25:51.650 --> 25:56.316
that never, never would have happened. And the way 
it happened was the coordinating board, with Lyne

25:56.916 --> 26:07.789
Ruber's help, we did prepare and get approval for 
the masters. and the bachelors and the

26:08.765 --> 26:36.763
coordinating board then in that same action when 
we requested all three refused the PhD

26:08.765 --> 26:36.763
and I was told the reason was you need to develop 
some graduates and then some masters graduates

26:08.765 --> 26:36.763
and then ultimately track faculty and students 
with enough critical mass to make a PhD And I argued

26:38.195 --> 26:40.839
we'd be 20 years getting to that point. But what 
they really wanted me to do was to develop, I would

26:41.881 --> 26:57.265
say, like a pyramid, a broad base, a lot of 
instructors, a lot of assistant professors,

26:41.881 --> 26:57.265
fewer associates, and one or two PhDs.

27:00.350 --> 27:04.877
I persuaded, I think I persuaded President Rudder 
We had to do it like an ice cream cone. We had to have a

27:07.011 --> 27:13.560
cadre of top, full professors with national 
reputations if we were going to do this thing. And

27:15.023 --> 27:16.124
he sent me over. Actually, a couple trips I made to 
Austin at his behest, he'd call me up and say, I want

27:16.184 --> 27:23.295
to go over to Austin. There's some people I want you 
to meet, either politicians or legislators. Can

27:29.484 --> 27:29.965
you go? And I said, of course I can go. So he said, 
meet me at the airport. He had a twin engine plane.

27:35.857 --> 27:40.703
And he wasn't above testing his people, though. 
And I remember on one trip coming back in the plane

27:41.004 --> 27:52.319
with him, I was sitting in the co-pilot seat, and he 
said to the pilot, hand less the wheel. I want him to

27:52.579 --> 27:53.480
fly. Because he knew I was a licensed private 
pilot. And I'd be like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. So I

27:58.527 --> 28:05.256
flew it about halfway from Austin back, not to 
land, but it was a faster plane than us.

28:06.113 --> 28:10.937
Comfortable flying, but I think he just wanted to 
see what I was made out of. In any event, he sent me to

28:11.458 --> 28:12.959
Austin. I sat down with the commissioner, Reed. I 
can't remember his first name. We will.

28:20.986 --> 28:21.447
Bevington. Bevington Reed, you're correct. In 
any event, we worked on a yellow faculty pad of

28:25.150 --> 28:33.418
paper on names for the graduate degrees. And I 
wanted resources in it. wanted recreation in it

28:36.421 --> 29:00.977
played around with a lot of different terms there 
were so many maximum letters you know a limit to the

28:36.421 --> 29:00.977
maximum letters could be any way finally decided 
recreation and aspirin in the middle recreation

28:36.421 --> 29:00.977
and resource of development I wanted a strong 
outdoor environmental flavor in it he said yeah we

28:36.421 --> 29:00.977
can do that he said in fact it'll be easier to 
because we got a problem with the board he didn't

29:01.463 --> 29:26.138
tell me how many but he said we have a significant 
number of texas tech graduates on the board we will

29:01.463 --> 29:26.138
never get you a phd ever that has parks in the title 
because tech doesn't have one but he said i think we

29:01.463 --> 29:26.138
can get recreation and resources development and 
he did and that's why our uh Formal title was that,

29:26.877 --> 29:28.959
didn't have parks. Our department continued, and 
our undergraduate degree was recreation and

29:29.180 --> 29:33.405
parks. Do you have any idea what year that doctoral 
program was approved? I can get that for you. But

29:39.752 --> 29:41.334
three or four years into it? Oh, yeah. No longer 
than that. I think that proposal went in in 69 ASCA.

29:48.723 --> 29:53.188
Those first, we'll say those first four or five 
years of the 60s, Did you run into any roadblocks on

29:53.472 --> 29:57.999
campus, any impediments at all? So far, you've 
indicated that everybody was positive. Was that

30:02.766 --> 30:03.347
true?

30:08.094 --> 30:21.454
To a large degree, yes, but I had a certain amount of 
turf wars with health and physical education

30:08.094 --> 30:21.454
because around the country, the normal title is 
health physical education and recreation at this

30:22.987 --> 30:49.585
school they didn't have recreation and he wanted 
it and he was justifiably i guess jealous of

30:22.987 --> 30:49.585
something starting that had recreation parks in 
the title our our main focus was not community

30:22.987 --> 30:49.585
recreation which is the focus at most other 
schools it's therapeutic recreation and youth

30:50.442 --> 30:53.288
recreation and community recreation. There were 
a lot of other schools doing that. We wanted to do

30:55.071 --> 30:58.358
something different here that was tied to the 
resources. So, yeah, there was every time they

30:59.019 --> 31:10.341
would suggest or propose a course that had 
recreation in the title, Recreation Adventure or

30:59.019 --> 31:10.341
something like that, outdoor recreation, 
sports, you know, then the curriculum committee

31:11.806 --> 31:24.042
at the college level would send it to me, and we'd 
negotiate with them. And every time I wanted

31:24.062 --> 31:31.192
something, then he would similarly take a hard 
look at it, and we'd have to compromise. Trivia, we

31:31.352 --> 31:34.436
bounce back to Michigan State for a second. Did you 
ever up there encounter a fellow named Woody

31:34.537 --> 31:37.581
Verner? Durwood T. Verner. Yeah, yeah. He became a 
vice president? And then was president at Oakland

31:44.416 --> 31:49.462
when they created that campus, and then went to 
Nebraska. The reason I ask is he's class of 1940

31:50.203 --> 31:57.772
here, and he was all everything. If you look at the 
yearbook that year, you find Woody Varner in every

31:58.132 --> 32:03.038
page. He was from Cottonwood, Texas, out toward 
Abilene. He always laughed. He was 10%. of the

32:10.818 --> 32:37.939
graduating class of Cottonwood his senior but you 
didn't know him then I didn't realize I knew him but

32:10.818 --> 32:37.939
I didn't realize it was an A&M connection with him 
because I knew nothing about this school in fact I

32:10.818 --> 32:37.939
was living in what we call the faculty bricks up 
there the Cherry Lane bricks on the Michigan State

32:10.818 --> 32:37.939
campus which were two story eight family things 
and my neighbor across the street was a teaching in

32:38.864 --> 32:44.709
ag economics.

32:44.729 --> 32:56.740
And his wife and mine and his kids and mine and he and 
I got quite close there over my first year before I

32:44.729 --> 32:56.740
moved off to a private house.

33:01.925 --> 33:06.829
Finally I told him that I was being recruited to 
come and look at a position at Texas A&M. I said,

33:07.687 --> 33:12.534
it's some little place down in Central Texas 
somewhere. He said, I was born on that campus. I

33:16.339 --> 33:17.501
said, what are you talking about? He said, my 
father was head. This was James Bonham. My father

33:21.506 --> 33:24.491
was head of ag economics before Ty Tim. And he had 
gone to Harvard and so on, and so I had no idea he was

33:25.953 --> 33:31.180
from Texas. He said, I said, what about this? 
Should I even go and look at this place? What kind of

33:38.104 --> 33:39.166
a school is it? And he gave me this background 
about, what, the poor boys,

33:39.186 --> 33:51.728
social misfits, some kind of a thing like that. And 
he said, it has the potential to be a great school.

33:57.232 --> 34:01.198
but they're going to have to drag it kicking and 
screaming into the 20th century. So I went with

34:01.799 --> 34:11.533
that kind of, on that interview, with that kind of a 
negative almost attitude, and President Rutter

34:01.799 --> 34:11.533
just absolutely turned it around. How did you and 
your family feel you were received as newcomers in

34:12.395 --> 34:17.382
the community? Very warmly, very warmly. We 
rented down in Bryan initially and joined the

34:22.021 --> 34:31.736
Presbyterian Church, although both our roots 
were in a small Baptist church in Michigan. And

34:33.018 --> 34:44.355
Dick Potts nominated me in the spring of 66 to the 
one Rotary Club in town. Dean Patterson's

34:46.798 --> 34:51.285
associate dean was Harry Kunkel, and Kunkel was 
closely connected with Henry

34:52.160 --> 35:11.535
Clay, president of First Bank in Bryan, and was on 
the board of directors of that bank, introduced me

34:52.160 --> 35:11.535
to Henry Clay, got me banking there. I had been a 
pretty big fish as city forester and deputy park

35:16.561 --> 35:44.053
commissioner in Topeka Kansas which is a state 
capital and I kind of liked that ambitious

35:16.561 --> 35:44.053
inordinately ambitious and and I felt similarly 
the the warmth and the openness of of Bryan and

35:16.561 --> 35:44.053
College Station was easy to feel the separation 
between the two and the competitiveness of the two

35:16.561 --> 35:44.053
instead of you know I've been involved in bottom 
municipal administration in Kansas and here were

35:44.827 --> 36:08.556
two cities that deserve to be one city and yet there 
was no way they were going to merge and that was

35:44.827 --> 36:08.556
pretty apparent but as far as the people were it was 
a small tightly knit community we went to get a

35:44.827 --> 36:08.556
chair upholstered I remember at Kepchinski's and 
when we introduced ourselves, he said, this town

36:09.616 --> 36:16.197
is getting so big, I just don't know everybody 
anymore. I used to know everybody that came

36:16.297 --> 36:19.005
through that door. So it was that kind of a rather 
rural community. As you look back, the fact that

36:23.437 --> 36:35.310
you had been at Michigan State, a separate land 
grant school, was that helpful in your being able

36:23.437 --> 36:35.310
to understand A&M a little more quickly? Oh, 
absolutely. Couldn't have done it otherwise

36:36.791 --> 36:43.098
because that pattern is so strong through the 
states. Michigan State, of course, is proud of the

36:45.000 --> 36:49.705
fact that they are the pioneer land grant school. 
And here... John Hutchinson, who was director of

36:53.963 --> 37:00.373
Extension, ran Extension as a personal fiefdom. 
No, that's not fair. He ran it as a separate family.

37:05.601 --> 37:11.270
And he took care of his folks, and he demanded a lot 
of adulation from them, and he got it. But that, as I

37:12.592 --> 37:22.367
went through the years and finally became, Harry 
Kunkel became dean and I became one of his senior

37:23.900 --> 37:46.431
statesman in terms of longevity, he told us in one 
staff meeting that he was seriously considering

37:23.900 --> 37:46.431
giving up the directorship of the Agricultural 
Experiment Station, giving that to one of his

37:23.900 --> 37:46.431
associates as full director. and I argued long and 
hard that he shouldn't do it that it was important

37:47.440 --> 38:13.482
as my crusty old Dean Cowden had been in Michigan 
State to wear all three hats so that ultimately

37:47.440 --> 38:13.482
when it came down to a decision point he was able to 
make that final decision and if if Kunkel gave away

37:47.440 --> 38:13.482
that very likely he would rule it someday when they 
came to a split decision over something and that

37:47.440 --> 38:13.482
happened that actually happened Now, when you 
arrived, women had just been admitted officially

38:13.580 --> 38:22.877
and the corps had just been made optional. Was that 
in 66? I thought it was a little later than that.

38:26.503 --> 38:36.381
Well, it was right about, but we didn't have many 
women for a number of years because it was

38:26.503 --> 38:36.381
primarily for the graduate and professional. 
area, not the undergraduate, unless you were a

38:37.238 --> 38:41.365
dependent. When did you, let's go back to, who was 
your first significant departmental hire? When

38:52.845 --> 38:58.394
did you really hire somebody that began to 
demonstrate that this program was on the map? I was

39:00.658 --> 39:02.942
very fortunate.

39:05.504 --> 39:15.618
And I'd have to look in our continuity of 
newsletters to tell you exactly, but I hired an

39:05.504 --> 39:15.618
instructor, and then very quickly after, two full 
professors. I hired my former department head for

39:16.979 --> 39:28.375
Michigan State, who's as near a genius as I'll 
probably ever meet, but a very great cynic,

39:16.979 --> 39:28.375
because he'd seen it all before. So he was looking 
for something else.

39:34.073 --> 40:00.621
and then that was Dr. Frank Suggett and so he left 
Michigan State and came with me and then Claire

39:34.073 --> 40:00.621
Gunn who had been on my master's committee and was a 
landscape architect with strong international

39:34.073 --> 40:00.621
tourism leanings was teaching at the University 
of Hawaii on a short-term basis planning to go back

39:34.073 --> 40:00.621
to Michigan State and I lured him to Texas instead 
and then brought in Carlton Van Doren out of

40:01.647 --> 40:16.941
geography who was came as an associate professor 
so there was that ice cream cone I wanted to build

40:01.647 --> 40:16.941
from the top down. When you were recruiting those 
senior people what was the primary point of

40:17.882 --> 40:26.290
attraction you could offer them? A chance to do 
something that had never been done before. At

40:30.214 --> 40:31.215
Michigan State Our recreation program and the 
other resource departments, wildlife fisheries

40:31.685 --> 40:45.679
range, were in what was called a conservation 
institute. The people were full-time in separate

40:45.699 --> 40:56.730
departments, but part of their salary was paid by 
the conservation institute to do some minor

40:45.699 --> 40:56.730
amount of research or work there.

40:58.786 --> 41:09.155
I think the thing that persuaded these senior 
people to come here to an unknown place and an

40:58.786 --> 41:09.155
unknown experience was that I said, I want to turn 
that model inside out. I want to own all the salary.

41:13.379 --> 41:14.580
I want to have the institute. I want to have people 
with different backgrounds. But I want to own the

41:16.662 --> 41:18.684
whole person. And so

41:19.725 --> 41:28.152
Sugga was a Harvard scholar, outstanding student 
there. Dunn was landscape architect. Van Doren

41:30.172 --> 41:31.594
was a geographer. I'd hired a couple of 
instructors along the way. Dave Reed, who was a

41:37.301 --> 41:43.168
Texas boy and a graduate of Parks in Texas Tech. And 
Dowell, who was a community recreation lad out of

41:43.188 --> 41:49.796
Louisiana that had been my first hire. And the idea 
was to have people from many different

41:51.038 --> 41:58.527
disciplines, but all focusing their energy on 
some aspect of outdoor recreation. Now, did you

42:02.312 --> 42:07.920
say to them, we're planning to be first-rate 
national class? Absolutely. Absolutely. That

42:09.842 --> 42:21.577
was the vision that, you know, if they weren't 
prepared to work toward that end above personal

42:09.842 --> 42:21.577
ambition, you know, then don't bother to come. And 
particularly in the rudder years, you got support

42:22.418 --> 42:28.446
for that goal. Although you had, let's see, Hall 
left and Byers became Vice President for Academic

42:29.405 --> 42:41.098
Affairs and then Calhoun followed in. Calhoun was 
in there. So that was consistent. With, at first,

42:45.844 --> 42:56.276
on the regional level, you were supposedly 
comparable to, or compared to Texas Tech. What

42:56.736 --> 42:58.078
other regional schools, what other schools were 
there in this region that had a program at all

42:59.054 --> 43:03.906
similar? Moved into a vacuum. We had about a 
thousand miles with very little competition.

43:09.441 --> 43:12.368
Texas Tech regarded, well, two things. I wouldn't 
have come probably except that Kunkel as

43:17.228 --> 43:42.122
assistant to Dean Patterson really supported me 
more than I ever should have been supported

43:17.228 --> 43:42.122
because you know I wanted everything and he kept 
he's German and he kept fighting me down and he said

43:17.228 --> 43:42.122
well I'm giving you half a loaf you know be 
satisfied today I said no I want the whole loaf but

43:17.228 --> 43:42.122
but he always gave me at least half a loaf before I 
came i knew urbanowski through our national

43:42.777 --> 44:10.050
associations in recreation and parks and i called 
elo and he talked to me and he said y'all come on down

43:42.777 --> 44:10.050
here we need a little competition you know i'm not 
afraid of having you down here so he encouraged me

43:42.777 --> 44:10.050
to come and start that's the texas tech that's 
texas tech but he was an a m graduate he claims he was

43:42.777 --> 44:10.050
the one that forged the weather vanes on top of the 
old horse barn Now, there was no program of this

44:11.009 --> 44:14.192
sort at LSU. No, no. Nationally, who were your 
models? There was kind of a program at Oklahoma

44:20.558 --> 44:30.947
State because I found out later Dan Badger, who I'd 
worked with in the York study, had recommended me

44:20.558 --> 44:30.947
here. Another big supporter that put pressure on 
some people was Bob Frazier, who was an Aggie, and

44:39.275 --> 45:08.961
director of parks in San Antonio and highly highly 
respected and he also called me frequently

44:39.275 --> 45:08.961
persuading me to come to A&M but you see we had about 
a thousand miles without anybody there were only

44:39.275 --> 45:08.961
about six schools in the country that had any kind 
of outdoor recreation resource centered parks

44:39.275 --> 45:08.961
Colorado State Syracuse, Michigan State,

45:09.734 --> 45:21.244
Cal State, Idaho had a little one. Cornell? Yeah, 
yeah. But not very significant. Michigan State

45:29.631 --> 45:32.213
was regarded as the top place. Some people might 
dispute that, but that was pretty much it. And the

45:37.998 --> 45:38.779
enrollment? began to do what? Just skyrocketed. 
We had 17 during the first semester and I think 57

45:42.285 --> 45:51.474
the following September and just kept growing.

45:54.637 --> 46:04.486
We had moved from the few offices quickly into from 
plant science over to the heat building on the

45:54.637 --> 46:04.486
second floor. The dean of agriculture just moved 
out of there and so I was able to occupy that end of

46:08.932 --> 46:11.917
the second floor that he vacated. And I guess we had 
maybe four female staff members and hired my first

46:12.938 --> 46:23.595
woman faculty member. Oh, hey, let's talk about 
that. When was that and who was it? Probably around

46:29.645 --> 46:36.576
70, 69.

46:38.986 --> 46:42.870
Billy Ingram was her name. And then we had probably 
a total of six or seven faculty members at that

46:43.691 --> 46:50.117
time. Speaking about the gender thing, Haskell, 
we did have one of the first female undergraduates

46:50.678 --> 47:08.436
in the College of Agriculture, a girl from out here 
east of town, Eva Zweifel, local German family.
