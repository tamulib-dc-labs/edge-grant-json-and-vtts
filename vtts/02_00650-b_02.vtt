WEBVTT

00:21.277 --> 00:23.801
That summer I was out in the Pacific with the Bureau 
of Ships. And I was out there on Guam, and in

00:25.703 --> 00:30.050
America, and Saipan, and Tinian. And I talked to 
Ellis Johnson, a man from the Bureau of Ordnance,

00:30.110 --> 00:50.018
who'd brought these mines out and organized their 
being sold in the harbors of the Japanese coast.

00:53.103 --> 00:58.349
And by that time, I was involved in quite a few 
different kinds of oceanographic problems. The

00:59.811 --> 01:09.722
principal one was the problem of surf 
forecasting.

01:09.802 --> 01:11.464
And there were two aspects of this. One was that

01:11.625 --> 01:22.317
if you looked at the waves coming into shallow 
water, the waves would be bent crowded and spread

01:23.967 --> 01:29.154
apart, just like the sonar used the same ray 
theory. And this was because of the bottom

01:31.637 --> 01:36.243
topography. You could tell quite a bit about the 
bottom topography from the behavior, from the

01:37.004 --> 01:44.934
aerial photographs of the waves. The other thing 
was that Sparadrap and Monk, in this country, and

01:44.954 --> 01:53.805
Harold Sparadrap and Walter Monk,

01:55.118 --> 02:08.975
people in England had developed a method for 
forecasting surf, knowing where a storm was, and

01:55.118 --> 02:08.975
how strong the storm was, and over what area it 
spread. You could tell where the waves would go,

02:08.995 --> 02:21.511
and how high they would be on a beach, and what the 
other characteristics were, how far apart they'd

02:08.995 --> 02:21.511
be, and things like that. And this was a useful 
thing for the amphibious landing. They were

02:28.779 --> 02:31.562
planning two amphibious landings in Japan.

02:34.406 --> 02:38.231
And one was called Operation Olympic, and the 
other was called Operation Coronet.

02:42.436 --> 02:44.358
And I was on Admiral Spruance's staff. His staff 
was planning these landings. Spruance was very

02:48.643 --> 02:50.225
much against it. Not against me being there, but 
against the landing.

03:02.551 --> 03:08.619
Because he thought it would be deadly, millions of 
Japanese would die, and a lot of our guys would die.

03:08.639 --> 03:09.700
He just didn't like it at all. And I was there at the 
time when the Indianapolis

03:12.204 --> 03:21.896
never arrived. I remember this very well. 
Somebody said, where's the Indianapolis?

03:30.648 --> 03:30.988
Don't know. We had not gotten an arrival message 
from Miller.

03:39.916 --> 03:52.094
It turned out that she had left about ten days 
before from Saipan,

03:39.916 --> 03:52.094
Formanon, and never sent an arrival message. And 
the person who should have been watching for this

03:52.114 --> 03:57.982
missed it. Missed the fact that she had not sent an 
arrival message. And that she'd been sunk by a

04:00.668 --> 04:06.116
torpedo by a Japanese submarine. And these poor 
guys were in the water for five or six days. Most of

04:08.820 --> 04:09.541
them were lost.

04:13.046 --> 04:16.031
And we heard about this as it came in. First, not 
knowing where she was, and then looking for her and

04:16.091 --> 04:22.420
finding her. Not finding her, but finding the 
survivors. She was the ship that had brought out

04:25.966 --> 04:28.870
the two atomic bombs. to Saipan. There were only 
two, that's all there were. And they were then, of

04:34.835 --> 04:39.081
course, I didn't know that at all. All I knew was 
that Indianapolis was lost on the way to Manila. So

04:44.769 --> 04:57.827
then I went from, Scruitt sent me from Guam to 
Manila to report to be on Admiral Turner's staff in

04:44.769 --> 04:57.827
their intelligence.

05:01.537 --> 05:10.064
I was just climbing the ladder of the El Dorado, 
which was Turner's command ship, and the word came

05:01.537 --> 05:10.064
over the loudspeaker that a bomb dropped on 
Hiroshima. That was the end of the war right there.

05:14.849 --> 05:31.223
Thank God neither of these operations, the 
Carmel, the Olympics, and the bomb, and all the

05:14.849 --> 05:31.223
work that we'd done on the intelligence, on the 
wave forecasting, and the bottom topographic

05:14.849 --> 05:31.223
mapping, It was, again, lost, but thank God.

05:37.616 --> 05:52.384
It was actually used, particularly in both wave 
forecasting and surf forecasting, and

05:37.616 --> 05:52.384
the estimation of bottom depths were both used in 
several amphibious operations.

05:59.806 --> 06:11.799
This was the, this is really the earliest big thing 
that Walter Monk was involved with, developing

05:59.806 --> 06:11.799
this wave force, this surf forecasting method.

06:11.819 --> 06:20.469
He and Sparadip were constantly having trouble 
getting cleared, because they were both born,

06:11.819 --> 06:20.469
they were both born abroad. In fact, Walter was not 
allowed to continue with the Navy Radio and Sound

06:20.489 --> 06:27.737
Lab, because he couldn't get the wind clearing. 
And he joined the Army and enlisted in the Army for a

06:32.289 --> 06:36.213
couple of years. And finally, he was sprung by a man 
named Cywell. He had become a major in the Air

06:39.758 --> 06:41.179
Force. He had organized an oceanographic unit in 
the Air Force.

06:48.348 --> 06:56.678
And Cywell had also captured Sparragut by the same 
process of making sure he wasn't cleared and

06:48.348 --> 06:56.678
giving them cleared to work for it. Not cleared, 
but kind of captured by his group. And they

07:02.999 --> 07:12.631
developed the surf forecasting method, wave 
forecasting method, while they were working in

07:02.999 --> 07:12.631
this group that's on your side.

07:17.677 --> 07:22.343
And then later they started a wave forecasting 
school here at Scripps. Lots of guys, lots of both

07:24.890 --> 07:35.644
Navy aerologists and Air Force meteorologists, 
studied this and

07:24.890 --> 07:35.644
learned the method, learned the technique, and 
applied it. It was applied particularly in

07:36.325 --> 07:43.094
Sicily, and it was applied in a very interesting 
way in Normandy. Two men who did that were Charlie

07:45.457 --> 07:50.383
Bates and a man named Crowell. Crowell now teaches 
at UCLA, and I think Bates works for Noah. And what

07:58.422 --> 08:07.476
they did was to say that the waves were going to be 
pretty high, but not impossibly high. And so

08:07.496 --> 08:13.886
Eisenhower decided that they'd go ahead, and the 
Germans didn't believe it. They didn't believe

08:13.906 --> 08:15.348
that they would go ahead. Nobody would be out in the 
night like this. But they were, and that was one of

08:18.032 --> 08:23.280
the elements of surprise that made made the 
landings a success. How'd you

08:26.860 --> 08:40.113
choose Mary Sears as the head of the oceanographic 
unit in the hydrographic office?

08:51.525 --> 08:53.487
I didn't choose her, she chose me.

09:00.959 --> 09:04.103
She appeared in my office in the Bureau of Ships. I 
needed somebody. By that time, we needed somebody

09:06.246 --> 09:16.620
out of the hydrographic office to do various kinds 
of mapping and descriptive jobs. And she had gone

09:16.640 --> 09:23.289
through a wave indoctrination course. And I very 
well remember her coming into my office, and there

09:23.309 --> 09:30.038
was this little fat little figure. And she stood up 
at a full height of about five feet three, rigidly

09:33.103 --> 09:39.593
at attention. She was just scared to death. And 
this was a shock. Put it in my alley. I asked her to

09:48.847 --> 09:52.452
sit down.

09:53.674 --> 09:57.460
And then I got her assigned out there to the 
hydrographic office.

10:00.359 --> 10:07.367
She then built up, she went to town, built up this 
huge, not huge, but big oceanographic unit, which

10:00.359 --> 10:07.367
wrote intelligence. Not exactly papers, but 
intelligence. Chapters for the descriptive

10:14.075 --> 10:27.531
oceanographic intelligence, descriptive 
oceanography, which is important to submarines

10:14.075 --> 10:27.531
and to all kinds of ships, destroyers, 
particularly dealing with the propagation of

10:27.730 --> 10:51.115
underwater sound and with such things as the 
density layers that the submarines could sit on

10:27.730 --> 10:51.115
and

10:27.730 --> 10:51.115
the conditions for

10:27.730 --> 10:51.115
wave conditions that would be related to 
amphibious operations and things like that. Also

10:51.495 --> 10:52.656
air-sea rescue. There were a lot of applications 
of oceanography around the edges of the naval

10:57.059 --> 11:01.284
operations. One of the things that Sverdrup did 
was to make current charts, which we then turned

11:02.525 --> 11:14.097
into handkerchief charts that we gave to 
aviators. And these current charts, suppose you

11:14.117 --> 11:17.261
came down in a raft. You could look which way you 
wanted to go, which is the best way for the current.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.889
For the current, both the current and the wind had 
about an equal effect on a raft. If the current and

11:30.037 --> 11:34.984
the wind were in the same direction, you'd go much 
faster than the wind. If they were in the opposite

11:35.284 --> 11:41.192
direction, and which was stronger, the current or 
the wind, which way you'd go. And this, of course,

11:43.455 --> 11:54.150
is a probabilistic thing, that the currents never 
went in just one direction, but most of the time

11:43.455 --> 11:54.150
they'd go in a certain quadrant, during a certain 
season of the year. And this was used also by

11:56.020 --> 12:02.366
air-sea rescue people to estimate where a downed 
aviator would be.

12:05.950 --> 12:09.974
Another thing I got involved with in the Bureau of 
Ships was smoke forecasting. This was, again,

12:12.016 --> 12:15.499
essentially a turbulence phenomenon.

12:18.382 --> 12:25.909
A man named Jeffries Wyman at Woods Hole was the 
leader of this group.

12:27.610 --> 12:37.263
The problem was which way would a smoke screen go 
and how long would it stay close to the ground or

12:27.610 --> 12:37.263
close to the surface of the sea? When would it rise? 
How much would it spread? How long would it be

12:40.768 --> 12:43.352
useful? How much smoke would you have to put in it to 
make it be useful and things like that? This work

12:47.818 --> 12:49.240
was really never used. The Navy really never did 
like smoke screens. But what was used was

12:51.222 --> 12:56.149
something that came out of this.

12:59.015 --> 13:02.600
And this was done by a man named Joe Cesare Lombardi 
Barber. He's now a professor of English at the

13:04.483 --> 13:07.508
University of California, Santa Cruz. Was a 
professor of English then, at least a young

13:08.870 --> 13:14.439
assistant professor of English. But he got in a 
sailor's suit, and he was assigned to me. And he was

13:20.848 --> 13:23.893
a project officer for the smoke work. And he got 
tired of this. this research part and decided he

13:28.748 --> 13:31.270
wanted to be more active. So he went out into the 
Pacific with some smoke generators. And it turned

13:35.714 --> 13:53.691
out that

13:35.714 --> 13:53.691
in these big operations like Okinawa and Iwo Jima 
and some of the other big landing operations,

13:35.714 --> 13:53.691
there were lots and lots of ships lying too 
offshore. And these were just sitting ducks for

13:53.731 --> 13:57.034
the kamikazes. The kamikazes were awful, more 
than a nuisance. They were quite a serious

14:00.085 --> 14:04.911
business. So what they did was to spread a blanket 
of smoke over the fleet. Whenever there was a

14:08.996 --> 14:18.348
kamikaze signal or alarm, they'd get out these 
smoke generators, not get them out, but turn on

14:08.996 --> 14:18.348
these smoke generators. This blanket, the whole 
area was smoke, and the poor damn kamikazes

14:18.368 --> 14:25.417
couldn't tell where they were or where the ships 
were. So this worked very well. This was really Joe

14:29.077 --> 14:31.541
Barber's very special job.

14:37.171 --> 14:42.500
Well, now, did the hydrographic office result in 
creating the ONR? Is that where the ONR came from?

14:43.983 --> 14:45.586
No, no, not at all. OK.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.469
There was something called a coordinator. There 
was a guy called the coordinator of research and

14:59.489 --> 15:09.278
development in the Navy Department,

14:59.489 --> 15:09.278
headed by an admiral. And I'm damned if I can 
remember his name.

15:15.683 --> 15:27.433
But he had on his staff a whole collection of very 
bright young guys, one regular naval officer

15:15.683 --> 15:27.433
named Bob Conrad and half a dozen young 
lieutenants, one of whom was Tim Wakelund. who

15:28.966 --> 15:38.284
more recently was Assistant Secretary of the 
Navy, a man named John Burwell, a man named Bruce

15:28.966 --> 15:38.284
Old, who's now with R.T.D. Little and was until 
recently Foreign Secretary of the National

15:38.344 --> 15:51.649
Academy of Engineering,

15:38.344 --> 15:51.649
a man named Kraus.

15:57.653 --> 16:11.352
But his admiral's name began with F.

15:57.653 --> 16:11.352
And they

15:57.653 --> 16:11.352
sat around and talked about what was needed for 
research for the Navy, these guys. And they really

16:13.875 --> 16:19.563
drew up a plan for what has become ONR. It was first 
called the Office of Inventions and Research,

16:19.583 --> 16:26.412
ORI, Office of Research and Inventions.

16:29.682 --> 16:32.125
And the first head of it was a man named Bowen. 
Harold Bowen had been head and director of the

16:32.185 --> 16:39.035
Naval Research Laboratory. The Naval Research 
Laboratory became part of ORI, as did the Admiral

16:39.876 --> 16:53.815
de Flores group, the group that developed 
simulators of all kinds, training simulators.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.360
Louis de Flores.

17:00.378 --> 17:13.658
And then they had a headquarters organization 
that supported basic research in a variety of

17:00.378 --> 17:13.658
fields and applied naval research in a variety of 
fields. It tried to support applied research. And

17:18.445 --> 17:21.350
this became then the Office of Naval Research 
after a while. And the whole notion was, and it was

17:22.291 --> 17:26.858
really a revolutionary notion, that the 
government should support basic research, which

17:28.222 --> 17:45.885
would be that research that scientists wanted to 
do, not the research which somebody in the Navy

17:28.222 --> 17:45.885
wanted to

17:28.222 --> 17:45.885
do. Alan Waterman, who'd been in the NDRC, became 
the civilian head of it. And then there was a very

17:52.213 --> 17:55.157
bright staff, and I was one of them. although I was 
in a sailor suit part of the time. Manny Piore, who

18:00.967 --> 18:05.112
later became chief scientist of IBM. Fred Seitz, 
who's now the president of Rockwell University.

18:11.821 --> 18:21.634
Minna Reese, who later became dean of, graduate 
dean of

18:11.821 --> 18:21.634
City University of New York. Joe Weil, who has been 
dean of Hunter College.

18:31.857 --> 18:38.627
Randall Robertson, who later became chief 
scientist of NSF.

18:39.128 --> 18:46.999
These people were just as gifted a group of 
scientific administrators as you could possibly

18:39.128 --> 18:46.999
imagine, all headed by Bob Conrad. He

18:47.921 --> 18:58.236
was never chief, because he was only a captain, but 
he was the inspiration of the group.

19:05.472 --> 19:17.306
They had really invented the notion of supportive 
scientists in their discipline doing the things

19:05.472 --> 19:17.306
that they wanted to do. I was head of the geophysics 
branch. We had a rule that we would automatically

19:20.790 --> 19:28.519
turn down a project, which the guy said, this is 
going to have all these naval applications.

19:32.443 --> 19:34.045
We also automatically approved a project which 
was for less than $5,000. Those were our two

19:36.979 --> 19:41.826
fundamental rules of operation. But we 
basically, in those days, didn't have advisory

19:42.787 --> 19:46.091
committees or anything. It was peer review, which 
everybody talks about so much now. We thought that

19:52.980 --> 19:55.223
was for the birds. We decided that this guy was good 
and this guy wasn't, and that was that. One of the

20:01.291 --> 20:02.412
things we did. And in my geophysics branch, there 
were three of us. One was a man named Dan Rex, who was

20:09.459 --> 20:19.573
also in the naval masseur suit, as I was. And a man 
named Earl Dressley, meteorologist. These other

20:21.576 --> 20:27.164
two people were meteorologists.

20:27.184 --> 20:32.331
And

20:27.184 --> 20:32.331
we And we decided that oceanography was somewhat 
different than, say, physics or chemistry or most

20:33.323 --> 20:45.998
kind of geophysics, because these ships were such 
expensive instruments. But as far as

20:46.999 --> 20:56.069
oceanography was concerned, we tried to support 
broad institutional programming rather than a

20:46.999 --> 20:56.069
specific individual project. And that's still 
done pretty much all the time. And what they do now

21:03.310 --> 21:14.247
is primarily support the ships in a separate fund 
and then support individuals or groups in their

21:03.310 --> 21:14.247
research proposals. All right, now I'm jumping 
ahead of my story for a second, but do you think the

21:14.548 --> 21:21.840
ONR is still as hard science oriented as it was 
then? Is it not more research oriented now? I mean

21:24.404 --> 21:27.889
in terms of special mission research oriented. 
Mission oriented. Mission oriented, right. It

21:30.530 --> 21:31.711
was research-oriented. It's now 
mission-oriented. OK. That's right.

21:43.484 --> 21:44.485
Well, I think that's true. The quality of the staff 
of O&R has progressively declined over the past 25

21:45.786 --> 21:55.317
years, 30 years, just about 30 years now. It is 30 
years, yeah. The staff in the early days had some

22:00.905 --> 22:04.390
Well, as I say, these guys who all became great men.

22:07.254 --> 22:10.959
Whereas now, it's very unlikely that anybody will 
ever hear of any of them. Except that they're

22:13.703 --> 22:17.989
devoted public servants. And the people in 
oceanography at least still have very high regard

22:18.590 --> 22:24.378
for them. Walter Monk, for example, thinks 
they're great. And people at Woods Hole think so,

22:27.423 --> 22:29.005
too. I think so, too, but they're not able to really 
hold up against the overbearing weight of the

22:30.217 --> 22:50.260
bosses who are imbued with this idea of directed or 
not so much directed as applied research. It

22:52.282 --> 22:55.566
doesn't affect oceanography quite as much as it 
does other fields because maybe in general still

22:57.892 --> 23:05.399
thinks that anything you find out about the ocean 
may be useful to him sometimes. That was one of the

23:05.419 --> 23:10.204
great things we put across during the war. And as 
you probably know, the hydrographic office,

23:10.224 --> 23:24.577
which regarded Mary Sears and her group as 
essentially an unnecessary pimple, now become

23:10.224 --> 23:24.577
the oceanographic office.

23:24.657 --> 23:25.738
And the hydrographer, The hydrographer is now the 
oceanographer, showing the ability of the Navy to

23:26.360 --> 23:32.890
absorb things. What happened to Mary Sears, by the 
way? She went back to Woods Hole. Okay. And she

23:38.839 --> 23:47.772
continued research on plankton, particularly 
zooplankton.

23:50.937 --> 23:52.519
But more particularly, she became editor of the 
Journal of Deep Sea Research. And she's a

23:57.467 --> 23:58.728
marvelous editor. And she really built up that 
journal as a great scientific journal. She was

24:04.694 --> 24:22.472
also the clerk of the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution Corporation and the board of

24:04.694 --> 24:22.472
trustees, and really a

24:04.694 --> 24:22.472
very important person in the Woods Hole hierarchy 
as a sane, gentle, good person. She also became

24:28.559 --> 24:32.705
very much interested in politics. And she, for 
many years, was chairman of the school committee,

24:32.786 --> 24:38.094
the Falmouth School Committee. And that was 
really her principal interest, was the school

24:39.496 --> 24:50.093
committee on Republican politics, on Cape Cod.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.615
She never did much science. either before or after 
the war, but I guess the most important single

24:52.844 --> 25:08.568
thing she ever did was that she was the chairman of 
the committee that organized the first

24:52.844 --> 25:08.568
International Oceanographic Congress, which 
was held at the United Nations in 1959. And, you

25:08.588 --> 25:18.143
know, she did a job like that, she just secured 
that. So strong-minded and gentle behaved.

25:25.684 --> 25:30.128
What was the ONR Joint Task Force Number One in 
1946? That wasn't ONR. Joint Task Force One was the

25:35.993 --> 25:41.178
Bikini atomic bomb explosion. OK, and that 
doesn't come with ONR. You don't go to that from

25:44.301 --> 25:46.403
ONR, then? No, I did. I transferred from the Bureau 
of Ships to ONR right in the middle of that

25:49.493 --> 25:56.884
operation. But I was on detached duty on Admiral 
Blandy's staff all during the time of the McKinney

25:56.904 --> 26:03.533
test. Actually, I was on Ralph Sawyer's. Ralph 
Sawyer was the chief scientist. I was on his ship,

26:11.404 --> 26:13.647
the Kenneth Whitey. But we were both on Admiral 
Blandy's staff.

26:21.016 --> 26:27.977
And I was in charge of the oceanographic, all 
aspects of the oceanographic and the marine

26:21.016 --> 26:27.977
biological work. Excuse me a minute. I've got to go 
to the back. Sure.
