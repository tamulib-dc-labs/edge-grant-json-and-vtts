00:03.102 --> 00:06.346
I'd like this interview to be sort of 
chronological in nature. First, I'd like for you

00:07.707 --> 00:11.331
to tell me how you became interested in science. In 
science? Why, I became interested in science as a

00:13.193 --> 00:20.882
small boy through an interest in natural history. 
And, well, first I collected the butterflies. I

00:26.007 --> 00:30.072
was an eight-year-old or thereabouts. And then I 
became interested in birds, and I got to be a pretty

00:30.693 --> 00:35.257
good ornithologist, I think. I was an amateur and 
belonged to the professional bird club in

00:35.277 --> 00:43.584
Philadelphia, near which I grew up. And by the time 
I went to college and realized that I had to make up

00:45.265 --> 00:58.696
my mind about something, I decided that the thing 
which I would do best in was something I was

00:45.265 --> 00:58.696
interested in. And I was interested in natural 
history. And the way you made your living in those

01:01.034 --> 01:07.823
days in natural history was to be a professor of 
biology, you see. So that, I think, answers your

01:08.664 --> 01:12.449
question. Where did you go to school? Well, I went 
to the public schools in the town that I lived in

01:15.232 --> 01:21.180
until I was ready for high school. Then I went to the 
Harvard School, which is a good private school

01:22.121 --> 01:30.552
near Philadelphia.

01:31.190 --> 01:42.908
And then I went to Harvard College for one year, and 
then transferred to Harvard, where I took my

01:31.190 --> 01:42.908
bachelor's degree and my doctor's degree. And you 
majored in biology at Harvard, right? Yes. What

01:48.235 --> 01:50.579
brought you to Woods Hole? The Marine Biological 
Laboratory. When did you come? I think it was in

01:56.047 --> 01:57.990
19...

02:00.670 --> 02:11.702
which would have been the second year I graduated 
in 1913 as a member of the class of 1914 at Harvard. I

02:11.722 --> 02:20.753
went through it three years, having been for one 
additional year at Harvard College, because I had

02:11.722 --> 02:20.753
four years of college, but only three years at 
Harvard. And then the...

02:30.337 --> 02:59.196
the first year of graduate study I I had a job which

02:30.337 --> 02:59.196
as sort of a tutor and then the second year I came to 
Woods Hole and I worked in the laboratory of the

02:30.337 --> 02:59.196
Bureau of Fisheries the reason I worked there was 
that for some reason which I am not clear about when

02:30.337 --> 02:59.196
the Bureau Fisheries Laboratory was built in 
Woods Hole back in the 70s. It was arranged, I

03:06.176 --> 03:29.166
suspect by Alexander Agassiz, that Harvard and 
Yale and Princeton and one or two other colleges,

03:06.176 --> 03:29.166
perhaps, were to have working tables for their 
people during the summer in that laboratory. So I

03:30.226 --> 03:35.773
went there as a Harvard graduate student. I didn't 
work on physics at all. My doctor's thesis, which I

03:37.715 --> 03:47.407
was working on then, was on horned toads, which are 
lizards, which I used to import from Texas. And

03:47.427 --> 03:55.356
then the following year, I took the physiology 
course in the MBL. And then following that, I did

03:57.445 --> 04:04.473
research there for quite a number of years until 
the Oceanographic Institution was founded. And

04:06.415 --> 04:09.238
you were at the Oceanographic Institution when it 
was founded? Yes, at the very beginning. Yes. What

04:12.502 --> 04:14.244
was your role there? I was known, I think, as the 
senior biologist.

04:23.414 --> 04:27.098
You see, Dr. Bigelow, who became the director, And 
at the forum, a staff had practically no

04:28.445 --> 04:37.559
oceanographers in this country to draw on. There 
were one or two young men, such as and Dr.

04:38.680 --> 04:52.261
who had worked at sea a good bit. But there were 
practically no oceanographers people devoting

04:57.689 --> 05:00.973
themselves primarily to the ocean. They were 
either biologists or something else, some other

05:01.914 --> 05:07.361
kind of scientist. And Bigelow hunted around for 
people of that sort who he could persuade could

05:07.401 --> 05:25.063
find the ocean a profitable place to make their 
studies. And I was one of the few physiologists who

05:26.309 --> 05:32.259
had paid any attention to marine animals. I was 
then studying hemocyanin, which is the

05:34.042 --> 05:50.689
respiratory pigment of a number of groups of 
marine animals, analogous to hemoglobin, and was

05:34.042 --> 05:50.689
making naturally. I think this is... It's 
speculative, but I think this is the reason that I

05:53.495 --> 05:57.141
was selected. I also knew Bigelow, but I don't 
think that was the particular reason. But he did

06:02.710 --> 06:04.432
know who I was. What sort of man was Bigelow like? 
Well, I'd like to refer you to a memorial which I

06:08.759 --> 06:18.234
wrote for the National Academy of Science 
following his death. Do you know that series? Yes.

06:20.919 --> 06:21.139
Yes. But you'll find in a very recent volume of that 
a paper, a fairly long paper, about Bigelow, which

06:21.322 --> 06:35.375
I think will answer that question better than 
anything I can give off the cuff. When you came to

06:35.435 --> 06:43.302
Woods Hole and began to do your science,

06:35.435 --> 06:43.302
did you immediately go to sea? No.

06:49.587 --> 06:54.453
I had this work to finish up. And I worked on that for 
several summers until I exhausted the immediate

06:54.473 --> 07:01.802
obvious possibilities. Bigelow, however, as I 
say in my article about him, insisted that the

07:03.664 --> 07:16.860
members of the staff all go to sea.

07:17.617 --> 07:25.626
he arranged that each of us would have perhaps a 
week on the Atlantis to do whatever we wanted.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.613
So that I went to sea in that capacity. And during 
the

07:32.514 --> 07:46.830
first, one of the first winters, I undertook to 
make a survey of the Gulf of Maine, which he had

07:32.514 --> 07:46.830
studied. very extensively, previously. But he 
had worked with ships which he could borrow from

07:50.304 --> 07:58.338
time to time. And his, although he covered all of 
the months in his surveys, except that during

07:58.578 --> 08:08.656
which there was part of shooting.

08:11.882 --> 08:12.042
Yeah. They were not synchronous, you see, or 
continuous. They were scattered all over a period

08:18.614 --> 08:41.016
of perhaps 10 years, whereas I undertook to go out 
on the average of every five or six weeks and make a

08:18.614 --> 08:41.016
survey and go about the same ground, you see, so as 
to get a strictly comparable picture of the

08:18.614 --> 08:41.016
seasonal changes which occurred. And this was 
really then your first work in oceanography, was

08:42.987 --> 08:46.092
this survey. Yes. And by that time, remember, I was 
at least 40 years old. I forget exactly, 40 to 50

08:50.178 --> 08:52.482
years old. So I have never felt that I was 
acquainted with the background of oceanography

08:53.504 --> 09:08.387
as I am with the, or was with the background of 
physiology, which I taught for quite a number of

08:53.504 --> 09:08.387
years.

09:11.017 --> 09:16.144
Yeah, except, you know, that most scientists who 
came into oceanography came in with no prior

09:11.017 --> 09:16.144
oceanographic training. They just... Well, 
there was none. There was none. Just became

09:19.648 --> 09:20.730
oceanographers. Yes. And frequently were marine 
biologists. Yes. Or biologists who... Well,

09:23.974 --> 09:33.987
during that first year, there were a half a dozen 
people here at Woods Hole and a few similar people

09:23.974 --> 09:33.987
at Scripps. We were the only really 
well-established oceanographic institutions

09:40.598 --> 09:46.806
They had a department at the University of 
Washington, but that was fairly local, I think.

09:50.030 --> 09:51.813
What was your first experience at sea like? Did you 
like it immediately? Well, I had grown up down here

09:53.555 --> 10:04.289
on the Cape as a boy in the summer, so I was used to 
boats and used to the water, and there was nothing

09:53.555 --> 10:04.289
surprising.

10:05.391 --> 10:05.891
I liked it. I discovered that it was very hard work. 
Oh, yeah? Yeah, because... You had to be up and

10:10.349 --> 10:18.717
working whenever the ship got to the place that you 
wanted it to be. And in a small area, such as the Gulf

10:18.777 --> 10:25.524
of Maine, that was only every few hours. So it was 
very hard work. And that was continuously being

10:28.747 --> 10:36.936
awake and sleeping only for a snatch here and 
there, as you could. And I can remember On one trip,

10:40.927 --> 10:54.198
which I went and had no one to help me, I didn't take 
my clothes off or my shoes off for two or three

10:40.927 --> 10:54.198
weeks. Simply didn't have time. I did the work on 
deck, and then I went and laid down on my bunk, and

10:56.840 --> 11:03.286
they woke me up when I got to the next place. And I got 
up and did what I had to do and laid down on my bunk

11:03.786 --> 11:08.010
again. So it was very hard work. Of course, on a 
large ocean voyage, it takes longer. The

11:15.473 --> 11:19.279
positions are spaced out at greater distances. So 
it doesn't that work. So I think the modern

11:21.722 --> 11:26.289
oceanography has a very easy time compared to what 
we have. They have very much more luxurious ships

11:26.690 --> 11:34.221
and more comfortable. Who were your colleagues 
here in the early years? At the Oceanographic. Oh,

11:42.101 --> 11:42.882
at the Oceanographic. Yes.

11:46.047 --> 12:11.042
My colleagues, that is, the heads of the 
different, I won't call them departments,

11:46.047 --> 12:11.042
because they were not departments, but of the 
different groups, were, first of all, Carl

11:46.047 --> 12:11.042
Rossby, who was a meteorologist at Tech, Selman 
Waxman, who was a bacteriologist from Rutgers,

11:46.047 --> 12:11.042
Norris Raichstraw, who was a chemist from Brown, 
Those

12:12.187 --> 12:19.297
are the three that come to my mind. There must have 
been more.

12:23.924 --> 12:26.108
Did you guys collaborate a lot on your work? Did you 
exchange ideas? We knew each other pretty well. I

12:31.656 --> 12:35.121
don't think we actually collaborated unless we 
worked together. I think if you look over the

12:35.762 --> 12:41.350
papers, you will find very few joint-page papers. 
But the institution was so, so small that we knew

12:42.545 --> 12:47.193
each other very well.

12:50.899 --> 12:54.785
Now, you didn't just continue your work here on the 
bay, though. What do you do next?

13:00.094 --> 13:05.222
Well, as I say, this took about a year and a half to 
study the Gulf of Maine. And I made one trip. as far

13:10.034 --> 13:16.201
as to Bermuda and the Saw, which of course was very 
little. And that's about the limit of my seagoing

13:17.162 --> 13:22.127
experience. A few short trips locally, but really 
very small compared to what the boys do today. They

13:30.456 --> 13:33.760
think nothing of going around the world.

13:37.103 --> 13:37.864
Yeah, yeah. In the development of the early 
institution, how did you try to encourage it to

13:38.080 --> 13:42.786
grow? In the development of the early 
institution, how did you try to encourage it to

13:42.806 --> 13:47.653
grow? What kind of people did you try to bring into 
the oceanographic institution?

13:56.204 --> 13:58.868
Well, I don't think we thought too much about that. 
In the first place, we were not particularly

14:01.011 --> 14:04.375
interested in growth. It was never conceived that 
this would become the great institution that it

14:05.182 --> 14:09.926
has become today. Dr. Bigelow was not that kind of a 
person. He had no ambition, no grand ambitions. He

14:20.837 --> 14:23.479
believed very much in doing good, honest work. He 
believed very much in observation, much more

14:24.020 --> 14:30.165
than, I think, than thought. That was perhaps his 
weakness.

14:35.202 --> 14:48.655
And so what we were concerned with was doing what we 
were trying to do and to bring our students up to do

14:35.202 --> 14:48.655
likewise.

14:52.359 --> 15:02.950
My students during that period, the only one that I 
think has become an oceanographer was Dr.

14:52.359 --> 15:02.950
Ketchum, who came down with me. He was my graduate 
student at Harvard. And he came down in the

15:05.307 --> 15:07.970
summers. And I sent him off on the ship. And we 
published a paper together, which I think was

15:10.613 --> 15:19.422
quite a good paper, quite an important paper at the 
time. The other students that I brought down were

15:21.765 --> 15:27.271
students at the Harvard Medical School.

15:31.596 --> 15:34.639
Well, let's see. They, I guess,

15:35.682 --> 15:46.673
they were before the oceanographic and worked 
with me at the... At the lab? At the MBL and at the

15:47.254 --> 15:51.838
Harvard Medical School. They were medical 
students.

15:56.603 --> 16:04.091
And so primarily then you just sort of brought 
students with you, I'm to take it, as they worked

15:56.603 --> 16:04.091
here in the early days of the oceanographic 
institution? Yes, yes. And, of course, after that

16:05.720 --> 16:11.987
first period of nine or ten years, the war broke 
out. And that changed things entirely. In what

16:16.571 --> 16:17.112
way? Well, we weren't working on our own problems. 
We were working on the problems which the

16:20.936 --> 16:27.703
government asked us to study, chiefly the Navy. 
Right. And the first project was the development

16:29.305 --> 16:34.410
of anti-fouling paints. which was started under 
Dr. Waxman, because at that time there was the idea

16:35.133 --> 16:48.526
that bacterial slimes which formed on the bottom 
of the ship were important. And I don't know just

16:49.747 --> 17:04.060
why he dropped out of it, but by the time it was 
pretty obvious that we were going to become

16:49.747 --> 17:04.060
engaged in the war, but before we were in the war, I 
was asked to come down and take charge of that. And

17:06.975 --> 17:08.537
I've been here ever since. And your first work, 
then, was on these anti-fouling paints. Yes. Who

17:14.222 --> 17:15.243
worked on that with you? Dr. Ketchum was the chief 
one. Dr. Ferre, who is a physical chemist now at

17:20.548 --> 17:28.275
Wisconsin, and was then, I guess, at Harvard, a 
graduate student.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.300
Dr. Wren, who was a bacteriologist. one of Dr. 
Watson's students.

17:43.936 --> 17:48.503
Then we recruited quite a number of additional 
students. There were three or four men from Yale

17:48.543 --> 18:02.464
who were students chiefly of Evelyn Hutchinson, 
Dr. Edmondson, and Dr. Hutchins. And

18:04.013 --> 18:16.307
I don't think Dr. Riley actually worked with me or 
with the troupe.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.634
There was one other, Dr. Deeby.

18:25.018 --> 18:28.662
And from any fouling paints, then what did you do? 
Well, then I became also... I became interested in

18:33.764 --> 18:38.890
the problem of submarine diving. And they had 
developed here the bathythermograph, which

18:38.910 --> 18:44.998
you've heard about. And they were developing one 
to use on a submarine. And I had ideas about that.

18:54.310 --> 18:56.232
They were not successful ideas. And so I was asked 
to sort of look over Mr. Vine's shoulder, who was

19:03.295 --> 19:09.063
working on the one which was ultimately adapted. 
And so I spent a good part of the war years also

19:10.104 --> 19:26.547
working on that problem, and particularly in 
instructing the crews of submarines how to use

19:10.104 --> 19:26.547
this instrument. And I made a good many cruises out 
of New London and Portsmouth with new submarines

19:33.248 --> 19:47.509
and new cruisers and new, new, new crews

19:33.248 --> 19:47.509
instructing them in this matter of underwater 
sound. At the end of the war, I wrote a book on the

19:48.370 --> 19:52.897
underwater operation of submarines. That's 
right. I have never, the war ended about the time

19:54.680 --> 19:59.627
that book was published. I have only seen one copy, 
which Vine swiped off somebody's desk. That's

20:04.872 --> 20:05.252
right. The only copy I've ever seen Vine has. Yes. 
I've never seen any except that. I have no copy of

20:09.218 --> 20:12.242
it, but I wrote the only word of it. Did you work with 
Vine in this? Yes. Yes. Yes, he was working on this

20:17.970 --> 20:20.153
instrument, you see. Yeah. And I was seeing that he 
got something done, essentially what I was doing.

20:27.263 --> 20:27.403
Yeah. And we worked together on an instrument 
called the STD.

20:36.564 --> 20:48.939
S-T-D.

20:36.564 --> 20:48.939
Salinity Temperature Depth, which was a device 
which you could lower and it sort of measured the

20:36.564 --> 20:48.939
salinity temperature and depth of the water that 
went through. And that has gone through some

20:49.699 --> 20:53.925
evolution and is still used. Yes. When did you 
first meet Roger Revell?

21:02.787 --> 21:04.869
I think it must have been in Washington.

21:08.974 --> 21:10.135
I can't remember the place. I can remember the time 
very well. I went into this office, and here was my

21:12.038 --> 21:22.970
idea of a beautiful young naval officer. I don't 
know whether you are old enough to remember, but at

21:23.751 --> 21:31.680
that time in these subway cars, There were 
advertisements, you know. And there were naval

21:35.397 --> 21:41.386
recruiting advertisements to join the Navy and 
see the world, that sort of thing. And there was

21:42.087 --> 21:51.420
always a beautiful, very handsome young officer 
with a high, stiff collar, usually, and a

21:42.087 --> 21:51.420
beautiful cap, you see. And here was the living 
image of this fellow. And he was Mr. Reveille,

21:55.066 --> 22:01.515
Lieutenant Commandant, Lieutenant I guess, at 
that time.

22:07.553 --> 22:14.159
And then I worked for him when he became more 
authoritative in Washington. I worked for him.

22:17.443 --> 22:18.944
When did you go to work for him? Huh? When did you go 
to work for him? Oh, I don't remember. About 1946,

22:22.128 --> 22:23.729
wasn't it? Well, 45 or 46. In the organization of 
the early organization of ONR. Yes. What were you

22:31.786 --> 22:32.747
doing there? What were you doing there? Well, I 
wasn't there. I was here in Woods Hole. But I was

22:36.773 --> 22:40.878
studying things that they wanted to know, you see. 
And I would make these studies and write reports on

22:41.740 --> 22:47.167
them and turn them into Roger. And Roger would 
insist on rewriting them. He would. It made me so

22:50.632 --> 22:52.554
goddamn mad. I am an amateur watercolor painter. 
And I can remember at that time I used to get so mad at

23:01.402 --> 23:04.686
Roger that I couldn't sleep. And I would get up and I 
would turn on the electric light and I would get out

23:06.448 --> 23:11.914
my paints and I would paint pictures out of my head. 
Pictures of boats, which I happen to know pretty

23:12.895 --> 23:15.178
well. And they were the best pictures I've ever 
painted.

23:21.105 --> 23:26.751
But they were all stimulated by the fact that Roger 
annoyed me so much.

23:27.760 --> 23:31.165
What were you working on in 1946 and 1947 for ONR? 
What was the next project? Were you staying with

23:32.346 --> 23:33.388
submarines? Yes, yes. I worked for ONR on this 
submarine problem. And, well, what I can remember

23:42.259 --> 23:46.766
was I got the idea. I was familiar with the sailing 
directions, you see, which the government

23:47.446 --> 23:55.337
publishes, which tells you if you're operating a 
ship, what you will encounter in various places,

23:55.756 --> 23:58.739
do you see? The winds, the tides, the currents, the 
supplies, and so on. An invaluable source of

24:03.845 --> 24:11.474
information for the man who was operating a ship 
and going anywhere. And I thought that it would be

24:12.635 --> 24:22.506
useful to get a submarine supplement to sailing 
directions, which would tell the submarine

24:12.635 --> 24:22.506
skipper what he might expect if he operated his 
ship in certain waters, in terms of the

24:22.840 --> 24:29.889
hydrography of that area. And so I wrote. It was at 
the time they were planning the invasion of North

24:32.352 --> 24:36.637
Africa. And I wrote a submarine supplement 
covering the Bay of Biscay from which they would

24:38.159 --> 24:45.267
naturally land. It was the first submarine 
subloan.

24:51.393 --> 24:53.275
I guess I'm old fashioned. I like to see things in 
black and white written in sentences as short and

24:53.295 --> 25:03.505
explicit as possible. That doesn't go, 
apparently. You have to be funny. So they took the

25:09.271 --> 25:19.982
job of writing in some future summary supplements 
away from me and gave it to a man, I think his name was

25:09.271 --> 25:19.982
George Stewart, who was quite a good novelist. on 
the West Coast. And they were sort of Hollywood

25:23.325 --> 25:27.529
productions, and I felt, well, nothing of them. I 
don't know whether anybody ever read any of them.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.219
When the war is over, you stay here at Woods Hole. 
What's your first job at Woods Hole, then? What?

25:40.001 --> 25:42.123
When the war is over, you remain at Woods Hole. What 
do you do with the osteographing institution

25:42.163 --> 25:44.566
then? Well, my job was to, of course... I was the 
senior biologist. I was responsible for the

25:51.299 --> 25:54.122
biological development here. And

25:54.142 --> 26:05.053
my chief problem was to get money for biology. The 
work on underwater sound, which the

26:06.534 --> 26:18.927
Oceanographic did through Iswin and Ewing, was so 
successful, you see, that it sold oceanography.

26:19.008 --> 26:22.632
to the Navy and through them to the world. But the 
Navy was not yet aware that there was any

26:24.014 --> 26:29.960
importance in biology. So they were supporting 
physical oceanography, but there was no support

26:30.761 --> 26:40.472
for biological oceanography.

26:42.514 --> 26:48.120
And the place that I found that I could develop 
support with people who were private individuals

26:48.505 --> 26:54.554
or communities which were interested in 
pollution.

26:58.339 --> 27:07.752
And that we knew something about estuaries and how 
to study the chemistry of coastal waters. And it

27:09.915 --> 27:18.107
was on the basis of that that we got contracts with 
private individuals or private organizations.

27:18.610 --> 27:23.517
The first one was with the National Lead Company.

27:29.445 --> 27:29.865
Mm-hm. They mine for titanium up in the 
Adirondacks. And there's

27:37.075 --> 27:43.043
an interesting story to that, but it's nothing to 
do with this. They carry it down to near the mouth of

27:48.665 --> 28:12.075
the Rurican River, where they have a big chemical 
plant, and they refine it to get out titanium

27:48.665 --> 28:12.075
oxide, which is a white material, which is used for 
making porcelain, white, in bathtubs and all that

27:48.665 --> 28:12.075
sort of use. And it's used in white paints as a 
substitute for... lead oxide. And so that was why

28:20.255 --> 28:28.605
the National Lead Company was interested in 
titanium, you see. Titanium was replacing lead as

28:29.707 --> 28:34.613
a constituent in ordinary paints. And they were 
sitting on as much titanium as they could sit on. In

28:44.470 --> 28:51.016
the course of their chemical refinement of this 
ore, they had to treat it with sulfuric acid. And

28:51.877 --> 28:59.303
they had a large amount of sulfuric acid and iron, 
which is also present in the ore, as a waste

28:51.877 --> 28:59.303
product. And they started dumping that into the 
Raritan River. And they made such a mess that the

29:04.889 --> 29:12.195
state very quickly said, you have got to stop 
dumping this stuff into the Raritan River. You

29:12.536 --> 29:14.157
must dispose of it elsewhere. And they found that 
they spent about, I think they told me, five or six

29:14.930 --> 29:29.707
million dollars trying to find some method of 
recovering material from this waste, which would

29:14.930 --> 29:29.707
pay for itself, and they couldn't find it. And so 
they decided to barge it out to sea and dump it into

29:30.508 --> 29:34.713
the ocean. And they had no sooner decided to do 
that, and it became known that they were going to do

29:36.555 --> 29:43.063
it, then that there was a very smart sports writer 
in New York who wrote for, I think it was the

29:44.073 --> 30:09.375
American,

29:44.073 --> 30:09.375
who ran

29:44.073 --> 30:09.375
a column in the New York paper, American, for the 
benefit of the sport fishermen, you see. And in

30:09.395 --> 30:13.759
this column, he began telling how this waste was, 
not will, but was,

30:14.161 --> 30:24.130
running nets and so on and so on. Before a drop of it 
had ever been put in the ocean. These stories began

30:27.853 --> 30:31.796
circulating, you see, of very harmful effects. 
Well, the National Lead Company had not a chemical

30:32.537 --> 30:38.542
problem, but a public relations problem. Right. 
And they engaged us to study their operations. And

30:44.131 --> 30:56.583
I can remember they sent me an account of this 
barge, how big it was, how fast it was to be towed,

30:44.131 --> 30:56.583
how fast they were to pump out this material, what 
the chemical composition was. And I studied it,

30:57.604 --> 31:07.473
and I made a very good, what turned out to be a very 
good prognostication of what was going to happen

30:57.604 --> 31:07.473
to the chemistry of the water. And then when they 
finally got the barge built, And they took it out

31:13.072 --> 31:18.100
with the first load of material. We took a small 
ship from which hole and went down and we followed

31:18.921 --> 31:23.889
it. And we zigzagged back and forth in its wake, 
measuring the seawater at different distances

31:24.630 --> 31:34.185
from the outpost.
