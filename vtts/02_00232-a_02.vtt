WEBVTT

00:01.313 --> 00:05.219
Yeah, in Mexico, in central Mexico, in the Bahio.

00:06.662 --> 00:26.714
I was fearful when these changes started to take place, which was much earlier there, back in about, let's see, oh, 1951, 2, 3, in that period, that this was likely to happen.

00:27.234 --> 00:28.857
A lot of those...

00:30.490 --> 00:48.334
Although Mexico went through the tremendous land reform after 1920, after the revolution when the haciendas and church lands were broken up, there were still family farms that were of fair size.

00:48.694 --> 00:54.582
But the farmer, the owner, generally didn't farm them.

00:54.602 --> 00:57.426
He leased the land out on a share basis.

00:58.638 --> 01:04.167
But the result was he didn't have any machinery either, and he damn well didn't know anything about farming.

01:04.347 --> 01:06.050
Yeah, so he needed the labor.

01:06.070 --> 01:07.672
So he needed the labor.

01:07.692 --> 01:08.634
And the labor needed the work.

01:08.654 --> 01:22.536
And when we started to show these same tremendous yields and differences, then of course, this little, what do you call them, sharecropper,

01:23.782 --> 01:27.807
The farmer would say, or the landowner would say, well, you have to provide the fertilizer.

01:28.308 --> 01:32.513
These little guys, they were smarter than that.

01:32.533 --> 01:39.622
And, no sir, this has to be on a percentage basis.

01:41.624 --> 01:49.654
Or, I don't know how they had the guts to say it, or they would have been out, but it worked itself out rather well.

01:50.579 --> 01:51.500
But what did they say?

01:51.520 --> 01:53.362
No, you didn't tell me.

01:53.442 --> 01:56.965
Oh, there was a struggle that went on in this early period.

01:58.386 --> 02:07.194
And it turned out in most of those cases that the farmer... And the owner wanted the tenant to buy the fertilizer.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.337
And the tenant said, no way, I won't do it.

02:11.438 --> 02:15.461
And yet there were a few people who were making these adjustments.

02:15.521 --> 02:20.586
And the way it turned out there in the end, most of those landowners...

02:21.342 --> 02:28.833
provided two-thirds of the fertilizer and the tenant farmer a third.

02:29.994 --> 02:32.978
But this changed over time, excuse me.

02:34.861 --> 02:36.704
Where were we?

02:36.724 --> 02:39.908
Okay, about the tenant.

02:40.495 --> 02:43.078
and your experiences back in Mexico.

02:43.278 --> 03:08.629
In Mexico, I never saw much disruption, and I think the reason was that most of the landowners, there were exceptions, where they had no house still, but most of them that salvaged part of their old haciendas had not mechanized, had not, I mean, they were,

03:09.892 --> 03:13.998
a generation back of the land reform.

03:14.018 --> 03:20.789
And as a result, they were not in a position to manage their own farms, at least in that early period.

03:20.969 --> 03:30.483
And of course, there was another factor in Mexico also, because a lot of these small plots were heated farms, and that's where the state owns the land and they're given for use.

03:31.084 --> 03:36.152
But I know on private properties where the owner

03:36.352 --> 03:39.755
was not in position to go back to managing that himself.

03:40.056 --> 03:49.926
Maybe his son would later, after he got himself straightened around, but that called for pretty good capital investment also in machinery or in bullocks.

03:49.946 --> 03:54.210
There were still bullocks and mules in operation in Mexico at that time.

03:54.771 --> 03:58.495
Now, let me say a word about Pakistan.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.857
In India,

04:02.710 --> 04:05.273
There weren't many of these large things.

04:05.293 --> 04:11.960
There may have been a few camouflaged, like I say, under names of different members of their family.

04:11.980 --> 04:16.484
But not, this was not why... Not very many large land holdings, yeah.

04:16.504 --> 04:17.025
No.

04:17.045 --> 04:18.286
In Pakistan there were.

04:19.227 --> 04:29.798
But it seemed to me that I never saw much evidence of most of these tenants being pushed off in the early times.

04:30.773 --> 04:35.999
And it may well again be because of the lack of management know-how.

04:40.744 --> 04:57.642
The owners themselves were just so ignorant of the farm issues or had irons in other fires doing other jobs that they just didn't want to be bothered with it but at the same time they were happy to see the increased yield because it made more money for them.

04:57.959 --> 05:08.830
And again there, I'm not sure, and I'm sure it varied a great deal from farm to farm, but how the arrangements were made for the cost of that input fertilizer, which was a big one.

05:08.850 --> 05:19.420
The seed was no problem, you see, because you get one kilo and you plant a little plot in the next year for your three to five acre farm or hectare farm while you've got enough seed to plant it.

05:19.980 --> 05:24.245
But the fertilizer is something else, and that's annual expenditure.

05:25.165 --> 05:27.848
But it seemed to...

05:28.385 --> 05:40.901
it seemed to me that suddenly there was fertilizer on all of that land, not the same level, but you could tell immediately that it was being fertilized.

05:41.522 --> 05:50.334
Now, we had all kinds of adulterations, both in Mexico, and I'm sure it went on sometimes in those countries also.

05:52.476 --> 05:58.324
In the early times in Mexico, this happened to be on corn, but I'm sure it probably happened on wheat also,

05:59.519 --> 06:12.877
One of the good farmers that we worked with, he always got good response to fertilizer, both in his wheat and his corn.

06:13.538 --> 06:17.103
But the neighbors, it was a miserable response.

06:18.485 --> 06:22.670
And then the government caught this guy that was the distributor.

06:23.511 --> 06:26.235
These were mixed fertilizers, nitrogen and phosphorus.

06:28.477 --> 06:37.671
And the guy, instead of putting in phosphate fertilizer, he was grinding up old volcanic ash, red ash, mixing into it.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.976
No phosphate at all.

06:40.996 --> 06:47.847
But to the good farmer that knew best, he sold him a true nitrogen-phosphorus mix.

06:47.867 --> 06:54.737
To the others, he just mixed up some red volcanic ash, ground it up.

06:55.308 --> 06:55.828
and sold it.

06:56.109 --> 07:00.372
So, dollar ration, all of these things come into the picture.

07:01.053 --> 07:06.718
Everybody trying to scrape off and make a buck and setting the whole program back.

07:06.818 --> 07:12.543
I think I told, did I tell you about the incident at Sonora that nearly derailed us there on fertilizer?

07:13.284 --> 07:14.025
Oh yes, you did.

07:14.965 --> 07:20.590
About these guys selling 218-18 formula when all we needed was nitrogen.

07:20.610 --> 07:20.891
Sure.

07:21.491 --> 07:23.593
And if I hadn't have blocked that one,

07:24.417 --> 07:29.802
It would have been six, eight, ten years getting it on track.

07:29.842 --> 07:46.898
Because it was with the big important people, after we'd finally won his confidence again on the varieties and now he was finally condescending to fertilizer and then he buys two carloads of this stuff.

07:46.918 --> 07:53.344
That would have killed us and it was just a pure stroke of luck that I happened to go up there and

07:53.881 --> 08:17.796
and my good friend Roberto Mauri says about six of us bought fertilizer and moreover he says we got this person that's selling it's got laboratory over here and we gave him room in our credit union the elevators where he's analyzing soil that was a farce

08:18.417 --> 08:20.920
He wasn't analyzing for anything.

08:20.961 --> 08:23.784
He'd bought some cheap fertilizer in the eastern U.S.

08:24.305 --> 08:38.285
that was a good formula for out there where you had to have high phosphorus and potash and then some small levels of nitrogen to start it and then you'd add nitrogen as a side dressing.

08:38.305 --> 08:42.771
And here he was selling it down there where it had no value at all.

08:45.299 --> 08:52.307
I have another criticism, and that criticism deals with this whole issue of tenant farmers, and that is the issue of mechanization.

08:54.028 --> 09:15.171
Some critics have said that once the landowners realized that they could make a lot more money than ever before off their land, they decided to mechanize, and that meant that either the tenant was kicked off or the laborers were kicked off, and eventually,

09:16.349 --> 09:20.032
They were in the eviction of tenants.

09:20.052 --> 09:21.634
What about that?

09:21.794 --> 09:24.616
Especially in Pakistan.

09:24.636 --> 09:39.189
I suspect that this went on, but at the same time, in the first place, you had to have foreign exchange to import that fertilizer.

09:40.450 --> 09:42.552
In Pakistan, there were no tractor factories.

09:42.572 --> 09:45.394
In India, there was this one that I was telling you about.

09:46.319 --> 09:53.548
And so, you had to have hard currency to import this fertilizer.

09:53.568 --> 10:00.295
And in the early times, this was mostly bullocks, power.

10:01.156 --> 10:03.459
There were a few small tractors, but very few.

10:05.642 --> 10:07.324
Obviously, these things are going to happen.

10:07.584 --> 10:09.586
There's nobody that's going to stop this.

10:09.707 --> 10:14.352
The drift from country to city has been

10:14.450 --> 10:18.535
continuous one from shortly after the discovery of agriculture.

10:19.196 --> 10:26.184
And to blame this on technology, that's unrealistic.

10:28.226 --> 10:39.961
And to think that the technological change can control all of the sociological and political things, I think is a fair, is an unfair assumption.

10:40.982 --> 10:42.904
Let me simply say that

10:46.664 --> 10:50.290
There's another side to this picture.

10:50.450 --> 10:57.141
Suddenly you'll have farms producing four or five times as much wheat.

10:58.342 --> 11:04.933
Damn, and all of this is being done with primitive equipment, the thrashing.

11:06.255 --> 11:12.064
There were people in the villages beating out some primitive thrashing machines, giving employment.

11:13.259 --> 11:21.633
All of the people moving that massive amount of grain, they got doubled and tripled the former wages.

11:23.376 --> 11:29.967
It wasn't long before, for example, in the book, The Villages, did you ever read that?

11:32.230 --> 11:39.823
You need to read The Villages and the story, the chapter in there about the Punjabis in India.

11:40.900 --> 11:46.267
This book, Villages, was written by Critchfield.

11:50.953 --> 11:52.054
And it's well worth reading.

11:52.094 --> 11:57.320
There's a whole chapter on what happened to the prices of labor in this Indian village.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.021
And it's by who?

11:59.063 --> 11:59.603
Critchfield.

12:01.085 --> 12:04.950
C-R-I-T-C-H-F-I-E-L-D.

12:05.622 --> 12:28.176
He's written a series of books that you should read, but this villages is a good summary of about his many years of experience in about 12 different cultures and societies ranging from Brazil, Mexico, to Indonesia, to Punjab in India, a bit on China.

12:29.117 --> 12:33.604
He writes very well.

12:35.002 --> 12:46.635
In this, he points out that this is the lowest caste, they just went into open rebellion.

12:46.776 --> 12:56.226
They weren't going to take these same things that the upper caste Punjabis in India had been, the Sikhs had been putting down on them.

12:56.246 --> 13:00.011
They just, there was more employment off farm.

13:00.371 --> 13:01.933
They just walked off.

13:01.953 --> 13:03.675
Or those that stayed,

13:04.195 --> 13:08.079
Their salaries were increased a great deal.

13:08.119 --> 13:13.764
One other modifying force was that soon after that, you see, OPEC came into being.

13:13.784 --> 13:21.411
And so there was big demand for Pakistanis and Indians, laborers in the oil fields, in the Arab states.

13:22.532 --> 13:30.540
And so with both of those forces operating, the price of labor went up.

13:33.203 --> 13:42.896
With both the agricultural and the demand for labor in the oil fields.

13:44.819 --> 13:55.954
But also, I think it's irrealistic to think that you aren't going to have some dislocations when you provoke change.

13:56.034 --> 13:57.556
It has to be.

13:57.757 --> 14:00.240
Yeah, and that's just what I wanted to get to.

14:01.013 --> 14:04.077
the dislocation is inevitable whenever you change?

14:04.818 --> 14:15.633
Whenever there's change there has to be, at least temporarily, some adjustments that you would wish could be made more humanely.

14:19.098 --> 14:25.367
But I, frankly, of course I must say that when this was all going on at its best,

14:26.545 --> 14:34.360
I was so damn busy moving around from one place to the other hoping that we could keep these balls up in the air in production and keep them going.

14:34.480 --> 14:39.229
India, Pakistan, Turkey, and Argentina all at one time.

14:40.331 --> 14:40.692
For all.

14:42.094 --> 14:46.402
The rat race.

14:46.422 --> 14:49.448
And so I never really had time to enjoy it.

14:50.879 --> 14:58.848
Did you have time to, you said once in our interview that you were aware, you certainly as a scientist were also aware of being a social scientist.

14:59.330 --> 15:02.863
Did you really ever have time to think about

15:03.181 --> 15:09.656
the changes that you were bringing about, the changes in the social structure and the economy.

15:09.676 --> 15:13.826
Yes, even from the early days of Mexico, I was well aware of these.

15:13.846 --> 15:22.185
Well, I knew you were in Mexico, and we talked about that in Mexico, but what about when you were juggling four different countries?

15:22.570 --> 15:33.668
I was well aware of it and I had one that was just the opposite, that I couldn't change and it hasn't been until very recently with the tremendous inflation that's forced them to change.

15:33.828 --> 15:34.389
What's now?

15:34.750 --> 15:35.411
Argentina.

15:35.751 --> 15:42.743
Because the landed aristocracy controlled fiscal policies.

15:44.766 --> 15:48.392
And they actually fought against the use of fertilizer.

15:49.672 --> 15:51.315
And it was a curious thing.

15:51.415 --> 15:51.676
Why?

15:51.996 --> 15:54.220
What was the rationale for that?

15:54.240 --> 16:00.111
Because many of those owned 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 hectares of land.

16:00.952 --> 16:13.755
And their song was that the only way to maintain the fertility of the Pampa is that you have to have vast tracts and use cattle, use improved pastures with legumes.

16:13.921 --> 16:20.470
alfalfa and grasses and cattle and then you plow some of this up periodically and plant cereals.

16:21.411 --> 16:27.279
Now that was eyewash because most of their pastures were not improved.

16:28.862 --> 16:32.807
The things that sometimes they called alfalfa and grass pastures

16:33.023 --> 16:44.582
They had planted, sown down to alfalfa 15 or 16 years ago and if you look carefully you might find 16 alfalfa plants in Hecate and all the rest was grass that had been taken over.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.511
So they were really not improved pastures in most cases.

16:51.093 --> 16:58.626
But this song convinced many of the, and there weren't many scientists, the scientists

16:58.724 --> 17:27.668
that chemical fertilizer, you couldn't maintain soil fertility, and this was the only way to do it, despite the fact on the family chakras, these are the hundred hectare, oh let's say fifty to a hundred to a hundred and fifty hectare farms, as we would think of them as family farms back here, generation back.

17:29.048 --> 17:33.433
When we put our test on there, hell, it was some of the best responses to fertilizer I've ever seen.

17:35.055 --> 17:40.222
And of course, we were trying to promote the use of fertilizer.

17:40.542 --> 17:46.950
We could never get it done because of these people close to political leaders.

17:46.970 --> 17:49.833
And they did everything wrong to block it.

17:50.614 --> 17:54.499
The varieties came in about 15 years ago, they started coming in.

17:56.453 --> 18:03.279
And a few farms, because there they built a little fertilizer plant that they never should have built.

18:03.720 --> 18:21.095
I tried them to, because it came in in the middle sixties, right when the big centrifugal compressors were coming in, which cut the cost of production 30, 40% compared to the old reciprocal compressors.

18:21.115 --> 18:24.658
And I was aware of this because they were being put in, in India at that same time.

18:24.718 --> 18:26.460
And I tried to, and the,

18:27.419 --> 18:34.147
American Foreign Power, which had been nationalized, American Company, Electric Power, in Argentina.

18:34.788 --> 18:40.075
And in the agreement, the capital was to be reinvested in some Argentine industry.

18:41.276 --> 18:44.581
And so, they came up to see me a couple of times in Marco Juarez.

18:46.063 --> 18:55.975
And I was working with these early stages of these dwarf wheats then, but still on the station, not out on farms.

18:56.967 --> 19:11.064
And they asked me about these fertilizer plants, and we were in contact several times, and finally when they were making the final decision, must have been in about 66 or 67.

19:12.866 --> 19:19.934
I was on home leave in Iowa, and how they found me is beyond me, but one Saturday I got a call to come to New York, or would I come?

19:20.295 --> 19:22.958
I said yes, and they said we're going to make a decision.

19:24.203 --> 19:25.905
on the size of this fertilizer plant.

19:26.466 --> 19:30.832
This was to have been a joint venture, Argentine capital and this American foreign power.

19:32.094 --> 19:47.695
And so I went and I tried to convince them not to build obsolescence into that plant, to build a thousand ton a day plant with modern technology and quit talking about that 200 ton a day, 250, because of the difference in cost.

19:48.876 --> 19:49.978
And I couldn't convince them.

19:49.998 --> 19:51.580
They said, we won't be able to sell it.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.962
And I said, hell, you can't.

19:54.140 --> 19:58.927
I'd heard that song here in Mexico also.

19:58.947 --> 20:06.579
And finally I said, look, let me bring, I've forgotten his name now.

20:06.599 --> 20:07.861
About what year was this?

20:08.482 --> 20:13.209
Probably sixty, six or seven.

20:13.489 --> 20:16.534
Okay, I just want to get into this.

20:16.554 --> 20:16.654
Okay.

20:17.208 --> 20:29.146
I said, let me bring the head engineer over from chemical engineering who was a contractor for ESO fertilizer plant in Pakistan that I had gotten to know.

20:29.827 --> 20:31.750
So I called him that afternoon.

20:31.770 --> 20:33.973
I said, will you come to lunch?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.415
We're talking about this.

20:36.557 --> 20:38.640
He says, if you're involved, yes.

20:41.224 --> 20:46.692
So he said, come by my office and I did and we walked over and he said,

20:47.026 --> 20:48.208
I don't want a lot of detail.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.449
I don't want to be confused.

20:49.650 --> 20:50.891
He's a chemical engineer.

20:51.372 --> 20:57.981
He says, how much fertilizer is used at the present time in Argentina?

20:58.001 --> 20:59.704
I said, virtually none.

20:59.724 --> 21:01.306
What kind of responses do you get?

21:01.606 --> 21:15.025
I said, the only data that we have is on wheat, but on the family-sized farm, which is where the social problems are, we get tremendous responses.

21:16.203 --> 21:21.172
And I said, but you will be fighting against the big landowner because he says you don't need fertilizer.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.435
And I explained why.

21:24.138 --> 21:35.680
And I said, moreover, this has to be a big plant because of the efficiency, the low production cost, as he had told me or his company had.

21:36.419 --> 21:59.305
previously in Pakistan but I said hell if they can't use it all in the beginning there's Brazil right next door a short haul sell it to Brazil because Brazil is trying bringing its fertilizer from Trinidad and from Colombia much farther transport he says makes sense to me so we went in he said I don't want to know any more than that

22:01.698 --> 22:04.622
Well, we started in and they were giving him the song and dance.

22:04.682 --> 22:06.304
They had to build a small one.

22:06.905 --> 22:08.567
He was a very explosive guy.

22:09.968 --> 22:19.921
By the time we got to the desert, this exchange had been going on with these officials, both Argentinians and this American foreign power.

22:21.803 --> 22:25.748
And finally he stood up and threw down his napkin.

22:26.453 --> 22:50.065
he said i don't want to be involved in building obsolescence into any fertilizer industry says you've made a decision to build obsolescence into the first plant in your country and i don't want any part of it if you want to do that last friday i went down to baton rouge

22:50.315 --> 22:59.008
and we turned on the valves on the 1,000 ton a day plant and at the same time we turned off the valves on an obsolete 200 ton a day plant.

22:59.108 --> 23:03.395
Go down and buy that for scrap iron and he walked out.

23:03.415 --> 23:06.640
Be damned if they didn't do it.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.683
And before... 200.

23:10.426 --> 23:13.150
Before it started to produce, two years later,

23:14.176 --> 23:15.918
They put a protective tariff on.

23:16.359 --> 23:37.568
That's the equivalent of $40 a ton of urea, $80 a ton for N. And that raised that, and then ad valorem tax on fertilizer imports, on top of that, added about $100.

23:38.948 --> 23:43.535
$20 a ton to every ton of nitrogen imported.

23:43.555 --> 23:47.541
The result is that we could never get it off the ground.

23:47.561 --> 23:52.488
Some people would bring in small amounts, but a disaster.

23:52.668 --> 23:59.399
And then on top of that, the Argentine government taxed 25% on the export of grain.

24:01.942 --> 24:07.791
And so the farmer would have to sell, for them to sell, the Argentine government's the only exporter.

24:08.125 --> 24:10.508
So that Peron left them that heritage.

24:11.209 --> 24:21.081
And that meant that they would have to set the domestic price, $25 a ton less, approximately, than the international market.

24:21.101 --> 24:22.763
And that's what their farmers got.

24:23.684 --> 24:37.862
And that prevailed for 20 years, and until last year when the economic, the inflation was so great, and when Alfoncine came in, the first elected president for a long time,

24:38.686 --> 25:00.171
Lucio Recca, who was a friend of mine, who was a PhD in economics under Schulz at Chicago, came in and he cut that protective tariff in half and bought up, no, 75 percent.

25:00.708 --> 25:08.556
and bought up all of the production of this plant and then he makes the two prices and we got this thing on track this last year.

25:09.317 --> 25:15.243
By far the largest yields that we've ever had.

25:15.544 --> 25:28.217
But more important, the thing that paved the way, even that stopped the pushing and pulling on the big landed people came about through the wheat varieties.

25:28.535 --> 25:43.800
When these little early maturing wheat varieties that we introduced in the cooperative Mexican-Argentine breeding program where we used to shuttle them back and forth, they came on stream, and they were higher yielding.

25:43.820 --> 25:50.912
They responded well to fertilizer, and there were a few people who bought little fertilizer, even though it was priced completely out of the market.

25:51.753 --> 25:53.496
But creative little farmers,

25:55.771 --> 25:58.554
they saw what was going on up in Brazil on soybeans.

25:58.715 --> 26:01.058
So they went up and got some soybeans and brought them back.

26:01.098 --> 26:09.809
And with the new varieties that matured five or six weeks earlier than the old wheat varieties, they plant soybeans and they get a double crop of wheat and soybeans.

26:10.550 --> 26:17.498
The result is that now Argentina produces six million tons of soybeans.

26:17.518 --> 26:25.288
Then these big landowners couldn't sit there on their cattle with a couple of cowboys because the income of wheat

26:25.606 --> 26:31.531
And soybeans on the land was more than they were ever going to make from cattle.

26:31.752 --> 26:32.953
Sure.

26:32.973 --> 26:48.327
And so that doesn't mean that they sold off all their cattle, but the best land was put into double crop, wheat, soybeans, and then generally corn, and then back to wheat with fertilizer.

26:49.748 --> 26:54.212
It took us all of these years to get that finally going in the right direction.

26:56.774 --> 26:58.896
You've got to work on all of those fronts.

26:59.577 --> 27:04.001
But you see, many of the best critics are in the social science, economics.

27:04.061 --> 27:10.486
They don't even know what the hell it's like out on the firing line because they've never been integrators.

27:11.347 --> 27:15.111
They stand behind their own tree with great comfort.

27:15.731 --> 27:17.613
And it's not just true of the economists.

27:19.715 --> 27:26.781
That's the reason our corn program never got off first base in Mexico and when it's needed so badly now in Africa.

27:28.482 --> 27:35.049
We've had excellent corn breeders, excellent entomologists on corn.

27:35.069 --> 27:39.273
Some people who've done respectable work on fertilizer of corn.

27:39.293 --> 27:41.816
But each one stands behind that own tree.

27:42.617 --> 27:43.978
Nobody looks at the forest.

27:45.100 --> 27:52.988
Nobody knows or nobody wanted to go out of their own specialty to put all of these pieces together.

27:53.744 --> 27:59.430
to produce the package that you then have to try on dozens and then hundreds of farms.

28:01.012 --> 28:14.246
And then when you've got a pretty good package to get the attention of those planners, economic planners and the political leaders, very often the economic planners, he can't see except his own tree either.

28:14.566 --> 28:18.250
And he's the most difficult person to convince in India.

28:19.124 --> 28:20.066
They were awful.

28:20.447 --> 28:25.717
And in Pakistan, they were mostly the Harvard economists who were there on contract.

28:25.738 --> 28:29.706
We could never get them to come into the field to look at our fertilizer test.

28:29.726 --> 28:37.121
Yet they were the people who were programming how much fertilizer Pakistan should have 10 years ahead.

28:37.582 --> 28:40.187
And they were projecting that same flat curve.

28:40.403 --> 28:48.175
And any person who ever saw one of those fertilizer tests would know that that data that they were projecting was worthless.

28:48.676 --> 28:56.748
Arzvek, this one economist that Hansen had taken out of this group and put in the minister's office, he used to go out with us.

28:57.710 --> 29:02.497
In the beginning, he couldn't tell the difference between the yield of one ton and three tons.

29:02.858 --> 29:08.807
But after he went out with Narvaez and I for a few dozen times, hell,

29:09.412 --> 29:17.762
picked this up in a hurry, and he was the one voice in the wilderness that helped us with the yield.

29:17.782 --> 29:35.222
I have another, we have to sum it up pretty soon, but I've got another criticism that I'm sure that you're used to, and that's the criticism that's been leveled against you and the Green Revolution concerning pesticides and environmentalists.

29:35.743 --> 29:36.143
Yes.

29:37.565 --> 29:38.406
That's a good one.

29:38.622 --> 29:44.569
Because in wheat, we virtually use very little chemical.

29:46.111 --> 29:56.583
Very rarely do we ever, did we ever in Mexico, once in a while there would be an English grain aphid outbreak, which you take care of with one spray.

29:59.827 --> 30:07.937
In India and Pakistan, the insects are a minor problem on wheat.

30:08.997 --> 30:11.840
And so this was never an issue.

30:13.242 --> 30:21.192
Most of the weed control, it's only now that herbicides are beginning to come in in places like Mexico in the early times.

30:22.033 --> 30:29.121
It was handled by crop rotations, by pre-irrigating to get germination.

30:29.142 --> 30:32.566
And to a large extent, that's still the case in India and Pakistan.

30:32.586 --> 30:34.027
There's very little chemicals used.

30:34.768 --> 30:37.772
My point was that I tried to tell these

30:38.275 --> 30:41.119
neo-ecologists, I called them.

30:41.940 --> 30:45.085
I was trained neo-ecologists.

30:45.105 --> 30:46.306
Why were you calling them?

30:46.326 --> 30:50.753
Because they suddenly discovered all about ecology.

30:50.793 --> 30:54.378
Hell, I was trained to forest ecologists before they knew what the word was.

30:55.419 --> 30:58.143
And they thought that I was just stupid about these things.

30:58.384 --> 31:00.487
And this was a personal insult to me.

31:01.668 --> 31:04.973
The only tools we had to... Many of them.

31:05.994 --> 31:06.375
Many of

31:06.575 --> 31:08.117
Organizations too?

31:08.137 --> 31:11.720
Yeah, and Ehrlich and the whole... Paul Ehrlich?

31:11.740 --> 31:28.638
Yeah, and organizations, the Audubon Society and up at Wisconsin, what the devil was, Hickey, Dr. Hickey, who concocted the soft eggshell hypothesis that led to the demise of DDT.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.223
The issue there, when I testified

31:33.558 --> 31:38.525
the USDA when this was all in turmoil in 70, 71.

31:39.146 --> 31:41.610
Over DDT?

31:42.892 --> 31:42.992
Yeah.

31:43.012 --> 31:49.241
I said here in the US you don't have vector-borne diseases of importance.

31:49.822 --> 31:59.436
If you want to ban DDT it's not important because it's you've got many other insecticides besides it's the poor man's insecticide.

32:00.237 --> 32:01.118
It's not a money man.

32:01.469 --> 32:04.473
This is the fault of the chemical industry, too.

32:04.573 --> 32:05.474
They didn't defend it.

32:06.135 --> 32:07.417
There was a place to defend it.

32:08.338 --> 32:25.259
But I said, when you ban it, and then you begin to exert pressure on the developing nations in the semi-tropics and tropics to ban DDT because they are polluting the environment, then I will object because I know what will happen to malaria.

32:27.682 --> 32:29.805
And in the January issue,

32:29.887 --> 32:42.779
of the economist of this year, Dr. Swamalinga Swami, who is the head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, a very top-notch medical officer, said this.

32:43.981 --> 32:52.108
The biggest mistake that we ever made in India was to ban DDT.

32:52.629 --> 32:58.915
We had brought malaria down to 250,000 cases.

32:59.030 --> 33:00.992
We were curing most of those.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.174
There had been no deaths for three years.

33:04.316 --> 33:09.962
We were, with medication, curing most of them, reducing it.

33:10.923 --> 33:13.886
We had a good chance of eradicating it.

33:13.906 --> 33:18.471
We banned EDT by listening to what was going on in the U.S.

33:18.571 --> 33:28.041
and Sweden, and we went back to seven and a half million cases, and we will probably never be able to get it under control again.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.072
And I anticipated that.

33:31.553 --> 33:33.054
I had seen what had happened.

33:33.755 --> 33:35.518
I'd been in those damn situations.

33:35.538 --> 33:38.662
Fortunately, I'd never gotten malaria, but I'd been all around.

33:41.625 --> 33:44.129
And you see the effluency.

33:46.592 --> 33:55.843
A good or bad environment is a sort of a subjective thing.

33:58.146 --> 33:59.428
It's a different thing for

34:02.446 --> 34:21.925
someone who's got a high standard of living, who's concerned about the beauties of Mother Nature, and I am too, because I grew up in that, and wants to enjoy the outdoors over weekend and during their month vacation.

34:22.245 --> 34:27.250
We all like it, or most of us.

34:27.270 --> 34:30.613
But he has a different set of values than

34:30.712 --> 34:39.141
Some poor kid down in the slums, a black or a white, doesn't make any difference, that will never have a chance to see those things.

34:39.902 --> 34:53.597
Or then a dishwasher in some restaurant in Minneapolis, or a worker in many of the menial tasks that have to be performed.

34:55.265 --> 34:57.288
So we have to recognize this.

34:57.308 --> 35:14.232
And when the U.S., an affluent society, tries to impose its will by fear about what's going to happen to the environment on other third world nations, I take great offense at this.

35:14.252 --> 35:15.653
I think it's inhumane.

35:15.694 --> 35:19.239
It's even immoral as far as I'm concerned.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.905
Who are they to make those decisions?

35:24.256 --> 35:30.733
We're all in this canoe together, and some of them in the back part of that canoe are in pretty bad shape.

35:32.959 --> 35:38.113
This has to do with organizations that parrot this sort of thing, as well as individuals.

35:39.410 --> 35:44.915
Why couldn't they use other types of pesticides to kill off the mosquitoes from malaria?

35:44.975 --> 35:50.460
Why couldn't they use other types of American products or develop their own products?

35:50.480 --> 35:57.087
Because it was the safest of the bunch and the lowest cost and it was never sprayed for malaria.

35:57.107 --> 36:08.978
It was painted on the insides of the huts and shacks where the mosquitoes during the heat of the day come in and hide and kill.

36:12.518 --> 36:18.167
And I was never convinced of the soft eggshell hypothesis.

36:18.588 --> 36:19.129
And what's now?

36:19.689 --> 36:29.205
This was the one that Professor Hickey at the University of Wisconsin cooked up, which led to the banning of DDT more than any other single factor in the U.S.

36:30.607 --> 36:33.852
The hypothesis was that

36:35.333 --> 36:37.115
DDT got into the food chain.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.639
It upset the calcium metabolism.

36:39.959 --> 36:44.124
The result was soft eggshells, thin eggshells.

36:44.565 --> 36:54.618
In the process of incubation the eggs would break and so the numbers of chicks would be of whatever species would be much less.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.402
Lots of thin eggshells.

36:57.502 --> 36:58.523
I've seen them all

36:59.077 --> 37:03.521
over when calcium metabolism is wrong from the time I was a little boy.

37:04.001 --> 37:07.945
When we didn't have enough, we used to use oyster shells in drying them up.

37:09.126 --> 37:11.889
There are other things that can upset.

37:12.809 --> 37:28.003
And the only experimental evidence that I ever accepted was some that was done by Bidman, who was a good researcher at Beltsville, USDA, where he used Japanese quail.

37:28.591 --> 37:33.838
and he had high levels of DDT in the ration on the birds.

37:33.898 --> 37:41.048
There were two levels, and then the check without any DDT in the ration.

37:41.068 --> 37:45.414
The levels were pretty high.

37:47.317 --> 37:53.265
In his summary, he says, with the higher dosage, there was a tendency

37:54.106 --> 37:56.229
for more soft-shelled eggs.

37:56.549 --> 38:01.115
It was not statistically significant, but definitely indicated a trend.

38:02.137 --> 38:07.524
But he said the curious thing was that most of these soft-shelled eggs came from two hens.

38:08.726 --> 38:18.479
If that were so, it meant that there was genetic variation that would have taken care of that even at that level, which was probably far too high.

38:19.961 --> 38:22.324
And I used to argue with the current

38:23.063 --> 38:50.961
head of the Audubon Society, Russ Peterson, about this issue time and again, and about, must have been about ten years ago, eight or ten years ago, I invited him down to Obregón, Cidad de Obregón, to show them how we had to have chemicals, both fertilizer and herbicides and

38:51.785 --> 38:54.268
pesticides, and we had to use them properly.

38:55.089 --> 38:56.230
It's no different in medicine.

38:57.171 --> 39:12.150
If you have an infection, you go to your family doctor and he diagnoses what's wrong with you and he gives you a prescription, you go to the pharmacy and you have it filled, and if you take that properly as erected, it'll probably alleviate you or cure you.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.552
And if you take it improperly, it may kill you.

39:14.993 --> 39:17.596
And that's the way it is with agricultural chemicals.

39:17.616 --> 39:20.880
And I say, if we're going to continue to feed these people,

39:21.248 --> 39:22.051
We have to have them.

39:22.192 --> 39:23.336
We have to use them properly.

39:23.898 --> 39:28.575
Now this whole issue has got, well, I started to say that I got Russ down there.

39:28.696 --> 39:32.811
I showed him this and I think he was pretty well convinced.

39:33.500 --> 39:50.616
that we weren't abusive and misuse of these things and I went out bird watching with him on Sunday morning and he cried he had a checklist as long as your arm and very happy and took him up along the Gulf of California in the afternoon to look at shorebirds and there were brown pelicans.

39:50.636 --> 39:59.464
The brown pelican was used as a bird that was disappearing from the coast of California as the clincher to put the band on DDT.

40:01.585 --> 40:03.287
What do you say about that?

40:04.060 --> 40:06.543
What was his response?

40:07.183 --> 40:14.912
We got up along, we stopped, and we'd see 20, 30 brown pelicans fattened, preening themselves.

40:15.252 --> 40:28.046
About a half an hour before sunset, we drove out on the point up at San Carlos Bay, just above Guaymas, where they filmed Old Catch-22 with those burned-out shacks on the end of this runway.

40:28.066 --> 40:33.392
And as we drove up, God, there was a shoal of fish in close to the shore.

40:33.946 --> 40:42.937
And just off the point, there's three islands separated from the mainland by about a quarter of a mile and from each other another half mile between.

40:42.957 --> 40:45.700
And I've never seen a sight like that before or since.

40:46.541 --> 40:47.902
But they showed the fish in there.

40:48.023 --> 40:51.527
Oh, God, they were just dive bombing these damn things.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.370
Numbers like I have never seen.

40:55.011 --> 41:03.801
And Russ was looking at them and Bente, his assistant, they were head of the Council for Environmental Quality in the White House at that time, looking at them.

41:04.405 --> 41:06.908
I said, Russ, how many are there?

41:06.928 --> 41:11.113
He didn't answer me, and I repeated it, and no answer.

41:11.173 --> 41:15.778
He's still looking, and I finally, I took him by the elbow, and I said, Russ, damn it, how many are there?

41:15.798 --> 41:18.101
He said, Norm, I don't know.

41:18.121 --> 41:20.023
I've never seen anything like this.

41:20.184 --> 41:22.086
Might be 3,000, might be 5,000.

41:22.106 --> 41:26.391
I said, now, Russ, do you understand why the hell you and I don't agree on this?

41:26.871 --> 41:28.133
This is cotton country.

41:28.593 --> 41:34.260
We still use DDT, BHC, and...

41:37.058 --> 41:41.139
the other chlorinated hydrocarbons and use them properly on cotton.

41:44.014 --> 41:44.858
Explain this.

41:46.120 --> 41:56.798
Is the explanation that there was something wrong with the hypotheses and the dosages that were used to prove, and wasn't very conclusive proof, the soft eggshell hypothesis?

41:57.699 --> 42:08.958
Or is this race of brown pelican, the Mexican race, so damn stupid it doesn't know that it's supposed to be laying soft-shelled eggs and becoming extinct?

42:10.921 --> 42:12.263
Well, we laughed.

42:12.344 --> 42:20.993
But this is why there's a lot of very poor science in this emotional environmentalist movement.

42:21.013 --> 42:24.577
For example, let me clarify this this way.

42:26.979 --> 42:35.749
I have undergone tremendous reverse cultural shock in the last year since I've been back after living 40 years abroad.

42:37.530 --> 42:41.895
One gets the impression from television and the press and

42:42.415 --> 42:47.540
radio, that the American people are being poisoned out of existence.

42:48.521 --> 42:50.122
And there's no evidence.

42:50.843 --> 42:52.785
Everything, the doom and gloom.

42:54.146 --> 43:01.874
And all of the evidence is that life expectancy continues to increase.

43:01.894 --> 43:09.621
At the turn of the century, 1900, life expectancy for both halves of the species was 47 years.

43:10.411 --> 43:13.314
and there was only a spread of about a year between male and female.

43:14.476 --> 43:32.576
In 83, the last data that I have available, life expectancy was average of 74, women 78, and men just about 71, and it continues to increase.

43:33.678 --> 43:37.482
But we are so damn affluent in living the good life

43:37.732 --> 43:54.036
that there are those who forget that all things that are born into this world are sooner or later going to die, and that there's a biologic time clock built into every species, and the human species is no exception.

43:54.056 --> 44:04.431
The longest, the oldest live person, where there's well documented birth certificate,

44:05.002 --> 44:20.547
lived to about 113 years, a Japanese, and there's a few others that have been documented at 110, but we're getting up close to where we are dying not just from cancer,

44:21.303 --> 44:29.131
We have removed many of the diseases that used to take a heavy toll in childhood and in youth and in early life.

44:29.652 --> 44:35.798
And so we are seeing a different group of diseases, among which is cancer of various kinds.

44:37.079 --> 44:44.066
The one that takes the greatest toll, of course, is lung cancer, which you can see the strong correlation between cigarettes.

44:44.627 --> 44:46.669
There's no doubt about this.

44:48.623 --> 45:00.680
We talk about pollution of chemicals in our food coming from pesticides, and some of them have been built into the scare of cancer, carcinogenic.

45:03.284 --> 45:18.546
Dr. Ames at the University of California at Berkeley, outstanding chemist, biochemist, began, he says, he was convinced when he began his work, these rapid screening tests,

45:18.863 --> 45:23.390
He used a simple device to screen compounds.

45:24.251 --> 45:31.181
He had a culture medium missing one essential amino acid for the test organism that he grew.

45:32.082 --> 45:35.547
And so suspicious chemicals he would add to this medium.

45:36.268 --> 45:45.782
That meant if they mutated so that that fungus grew, this

45:47.315 --> 45:54.426
compound was mutagenic, and then he had established correlations between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.

45:55.447 --> 46:00.254
And he was able to ferret out a couple of industrial chemicals that actually worked.

46:00.274 --> 46:17.119
But in a paper published about a year and a half ago, a summary of these 10 years of work, he said, then I began analyzing many of the foods that we've been eating since the day of Adam and Eve, that we eat every day.

46:18.280 --> 46:34.901
And they're full of these compounds that are either toxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, which will produce adverse effects on embryos.

46:34.921 --> 46:39.848
But they're at such low levels that they apparently cause no injury.

46:40.849 --> 46:47.798
We didn't even know they were there until recently, but now our chemical analysis are such that we can...

46:48.115 --> 46:54.121
analyzed for a fraction of a part per billion.

46:55.263 --> 46:58.046
So they're all around about us.

46:58.066 --> 47:00.028
So it's a question of degree?

47:00.048 --> 47:01.529
It's a question, yes.

47:02.390 --> 47:04.513
And it's a question of interpretation.

47:05.814 --> 47:16.165
And it's a question of interpretation if we control, and all of the cancer incidents, except for tobacco, have been going down.

47:17.579 --> 47:18.641
With few exceptions.

47:18.922 --> 47:35.976
There are differences between different countries in the incidence of different kinds of cancer, but the one that's going up and continues to go up, and it's going up now for women, and maybe those eight years of difference in longevity in women will be reduced if women smoke more cigarettes.
