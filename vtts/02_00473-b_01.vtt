WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:03.284
Where are those? I don't know. Some of them I've 
cooked up. Yeah, they're lovely.

00:10.652 --> 00:22.346
Now, since you were in the Corps only for a year 
before you moved on to West Point, you probably

00:10.652 --> 00:22.346
didn't have a chance to exert much influence as far 
as becoming a leader, did you? You didn't have a...

00:24.428 --> 00:25.329
I don't think so, no. In fact, I think your main 
objective there was... was make good grades, or

00:31.148 --> 00:39.560
make adequate good grades, and exist, make a 
living. Kept through your first year. Do you

00:41.923 --> 00:48.432
remember what you liked and disliked about the 
Corps? Oh, I liked the Corps. What was it that you

00:50.474 --> 00:52.898
liked? Well, I don't know, it's hard to say.

01:01.810 --> 01:04.554
This is the first time you were in a military 
situation. Yeah, well, I recognize that. But

01:07.017 --> 01:16.531
I would say, primarily at the time, the Corps of 
Cadets at Texas A&M was the thing. I mean, to be a

01:16.571 --> 01:24.682
non-member of the Corps, well, there were very few 
of them. I would say there was less than 25 who were

01:24.702 --> 01:30.130
day students who were more civilian clothes.

01:34.709 --> 01:37.033
Did you like wearing a uniform for the first time in 
your life? Well it was, it was clothing.

01:43.923 --> 01:55.240
And I would say that that

01:43.923 --> 01:55.240
was probably had more effect than anything else is 
that you had

02:00.468 --> 02:02.991
you had, I'd say money was something to wear. 
Whereas, I think the first suit of clothes that I

02:04.373 --> 02:27.285
had was my graduation suit, and

02:04.373 --> 02:27.285
the rest of

02:04.373 --> 02:27.285
the time I was ready to really dress up. you were 
graduating from high school. Not that you didn't

02:32.311 --> 02:40.139
have the warm clothes and the warm, warm jacket and 
shoes to wear, but sure. I don't know, I don't, I

02:42.822 --> 02:57.559
don't, at the time it was probably impressive, but 
the only thing that, at the time, my being in the

02:42.822 --> 02:57.559
Corps and I could see my home was about I guess 40 
miles away, 50 miles, so at that time you could

02:58.636 --> 03:16.076
thumb a ride and you could be home in an hour and a 
half and you could get out on the road and you'd be

02:58.636 --> 03:16.076
back to school on the weekend in an hour and a half.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.143
Did you go home a lot on the weekends? Well I would 
say probably once a month or something of this

03:22.163 --> 03:25.327
sort. My brother had left home the same year I did. 
He stayed home for one year and had Dad out. Then he

03:36.877 --> 03:54.722
went to Texas City and bought out, he was, well in 
the upbringing, he was a completely different

03:36.877 --> 03:54.722
kind of individual than I. I was the athletic type. 
He was building radios, worked on worked on

03:59.403 --> 04:03.607
watches, this type of thing. And so he went down to 
Texas City and well before that, while he was still

04:04.508 --> 04:25.910
in high school, one of my uncles, one of my dad's 
brothers gave him a complete set of watch making

04:04.508 --> 04:25.910
tools so he could change crystals and all this type 
of thing. And so he did that. while he was still in

04:28.040 --> 04:32.466
high school and then the year he was home while he 
also worked on that. And then he went down and

04:32.486 --> 04:54.958
bought this jeweler out which was just a little 
hole in the wall and with a room and he had bought a

04:32.486 --> 04:54.958
motorcycle and he used to come by and pick me up on 
the motorcycle maybe once every couple of months

04:32.486 --> 04:54.958
and I'd ride double on his motorcycle from there to 
Reagan but I didn't that didn't last very long

04:55.934 --> 05:24.574
because we had gravel roads and there's always a 
gravel rut and if you hit that rut going too fast and

04:55.934 --> 05:24.574
you got out of it why you really got in messed up with 
gravel and if you went too slow why you weaved and

04:55.934 --> 05:24.574
and I think I rode that thing back and forth twice 
and I told them I wasn't interested in that anymore

04:55.934 --> 05:24.574
and

05:27.187 --> 05:33.235
Because a motorcycle always ends up on top of both 
of us running full speed, throwing gravel all over

05:27.187 --> 05:33.235
the place. But being in the Corps, you could get a 
ride anywhere. I mean, you could go to Fort Worth.

05:42.027 --> 05:52.941
Not that I ever went to Fort Worth, but I think I 
caught a ride down to Texas City one time and went

05:42.027 --> 05:52.941
down one weekend visiting him. Easy hitchhiking 
in the Corps. Oh yeah. What way did the Corps help

05:59.776 --> 06:01.058
you?

06:04.021 --> 06:11.810
Well, I would say that the academics helped me more 
than anything else. The academics at A&M? The

06:12.752 --> 06:14.594
academics at A&M. I would say without the 
academics at A&M, I'd probably never gotten

06:14.614 --> 06:20.501
through the military academy. Did you find the 
academics difficult?

06:25.777 --> 06:27.198
Well, how did it help you? Well,

06:27.218 --> 06:37.529
at Texas A&M in your freshman year, you had 
descriptive geometry. Church's descriptive

06:37.589 --> 06:39.150
geometry. At the Military Academy, you have 
exactly the same book, same course during your

06:39.831 --> 06:47.038
junior year.

06:49.961 --> 06:51.323
Smith's College Chemistry. It was exactly the 
same course that you had same book as you had there

06:56.540 --> 07:02.487
as you have the same thing at the military academy. 
Normally not the freshman year, but either your

07:02.507 --> 07:09.334
sophomore or junior year.

07:12.177 --> 07:26.293
English being my weakest subject there, I had very 
good courses in English, freshman English, and

07:12.177 --> 07:26.293
then that was my weakest subject at the military 
academy. stood in the 300 somewhere in English. So

07:32.724 --> 07:37.752
I had to really work in English to keep getting 
found out of the military academy. And had I not

07:37.772 --> 07:45.724
taken the English at Texas A&M, I probably 
wouldn't have gotten in the military academy. And

07:45.744 --> 07:54.778
of course, my grades at Texas A&M, they accepted 
those on what's called a dog ticket to the military

07:45.744 --> 07:54.778
academy. which means that you don't have to take 
the mental exam. And when I reported to Fort Sam

07:59.050 --> 08:16.154
Houston to take the mental exam, well, what really 
happened was I went to the registrar when I got this

07:59.050 --> 08:16.154
telegram to an appointment to Westport. I went to 
the registrar, and they made up a transcript of my

08:16.174 --> 08:24.546
records and sent them to the superintendent of 
military academy. And then a week, ten days, or two

08:25.083 --> 08:33.776
weeks later, I got a form that the military academy 
required. So I took that over to the registrar, and

08:33.876 --> 08:36.099
they wouldn't make it out. They wouldn't make it 
out anymore. Because they said they already sent

08:38.463 --> 08:41.207
one in, that's where that was at. Well, then we, and 
then apparently, and then a month later, I got this

08:42.929 --> 08:51.462
letter saying they were sorry that the form at the, 
Texas A&M restaurants, A&M was unacceptable, and

08:52.049 --> 09:02.178
therefore they wouldn't require the form that 
they sent to be filled out. Well, I took it over and

09:02.198 --> 09:04.720
they finally sent it out. But when I reported down 
at Fort Sam to take the mental exam, I had it first

09:04.740 --> 09:14.589
offered in an appointment to West Point. John 
Connolly, an individual after whom John Connolly

09:14.609 --> 09:20.875
Air Force Base of Waco was named, was a principal, 
and he was the nephew of Tom Connick. So both of us

09:27.145 --> 09:30.270
were taking the mental exam. Of course, it was very 
difficult because you'd been out of high school

09:30.290 --> 09:43.370
for three or four years, four years, history 
subjects and dates, and you're just forgotten.

09:44.752 --> 09:48.398
And so while I was taking the mental exam, they got a 
wire saying I was excused. So I, based upon my

09:52.102 --> 10:13.324
grades at Texas A&M, I didn't have to take the 
written exam, and of course I passed the physical,

09:52.102 --> 10:13.324
and so Tom Cotley, John Cotley, failed the 
entrance exam, the mental exam, and so I got the

09:52.102 --> 10:13.324
appointment. So your grades there for one thing, 
and of course- They certainly helped you, yeah.

10:18.297 --> 10:34.117
And I would say that the subjects there are more 
engineering,

10:18.297 --> 10:34.117
if you know what I mean, than they are at the 
Military Academy. Because as I said, the three or

10:34.157 --> 10:47.393
four subjects that I had your very first year, you 
have either sophomore or junior year at the

10:34.157 --> 10:47.393
Military Academy, other than English.

10:49.972 --> 11:02.127
Did the Corps in any way, not the academics of A&M, 
but did the Corps, being in a military outfit for a

10:49.972 --> 11:02.127
year, did that, do you think that that had any 
influence on you being accepted at West Point? No,

11:02.147 --> 11:04.910
I don't think so. No, it's pure and simple an 
academic. I think if I'd gone and had the same

11:08.054 --> 11:18.527
grades that I was accredited college by, they 
would have been accepted the same way. Tom Kilday,

11:19.351 --> 11:35.415
who was attending St. Edward's University in 
Austin, he was accepted on a, because he attended

11:19.351 --> 11:35.415
college there and has done his grades. And also the 
fact that he was a football player. And they were

11:40.102 --> 11:42.926
interested in football players just like we are. 
Yeah. You were there for You were at A&M for a year,

11:45.777 --> 11:51.707
and after we finish this, we're going to talk about 
your West Point experience. But I've often heard

11:52.969 --> 12:03.848
many people who were former students at A&M say 
that it's more than an institution of higher

11:52.969 --> 12:03.848
learning, that there's something special about 
it. Even though you were only there for a year, did

12:04.068 --> 12:07.955
you get any feeling like that? Oh, I think that... 
the free decor of Texas A&M students, I think it

12:12.912 --> 12:22.885
develops with time. I think you, while you're 
there, and I think if I had been able to

12:22.905 --> 12:41.350
participate, you know, more into the going to 
football games, going to the basketball games, to

12:22.905 --> 12:41.350
participate, you're just you become a lot more 
enthusiastic.

12:46.716 --> 13:01.299
At that time Joel Hunt was a big star and if you could 
have seen him by you probably been a lot more

12:46.716 --> 13:01.299
impressed than you would if you just could attend.

13:05.566 --> 13:07.489
But I think A college where you have a corps, you do 
have a lot of esprit de corps that you just don't

13:08.228 --> 13:18.223
have at a pure and simple civilian college.

13:21.027 --> 13:31.482
Going to George Washington University to get your 
master's degree, all you're doing is getting an

13:21.027 --> 13:31.482
education. You're really not developing any 
esprit de corps whatsoever.

13:39.785 --> 13:43.690
What did you think about the quality of education 
at A&M? Well, I was very impressed at the time of the

13:43.710 --> 13:49.717
quality of education. Well, I think Texas A&M 
probably is one of the best mechanical schools in

13:51.659 --> 14:03.273
the United States, although it

13:51.659 --> 14:03.273
doesn't rank with MIT. I think it should, Caltech 
or some of those. But I think it should. as far as the

14:09.468 --> 14:20.563
courses they give and the, and how

14:09.468 --> 14:20.563
thorough. In fact, we, Mrs. Heddington and I have 
four students at Texas A&M right now, and we're

14:20.603 --> 14:37.146
attending one a junior, one a sophomore, and two 
freshmen coming in that we are giving scholarship

14:20.603 --> 14:37.146
for.

14:38.881 --> 14:42.806
from Falls County.

14:43.367 --> 14:49.575
And we just set it up for Texas A&M, because I think 
if they go to Texas A&M, they will certainly get a

14:43.367 --> 14:49.575
good education. Sure. OK. Let's start making some 
comparisons with West Point. But before we do

14:57.285 --> 15:04.635
that,

14:57.285 --> 15:04.635
can you tell me exactly

15:05.965 --> 15:08.868
We've already started on how you got into West 
Point. What were your feelings when you found out

15:09.329 --> 15:14.294
that you were accepted into West Point? Well, it

15:14.314 --> 15:19.480
was very exuberant. I mean, I would say that I was 
very, very happy to get there. Really, I went to

15:23.164 --> 15:25.507
West Point because it was free. I mean, I really 
didn't go there because it's West Point or the

15:25.947 --> 15:31.433
United States Military Academy. I think my really 
main objective of going there was the fact that I

15:32.122 --> 15:45.136
was looking at that stage of getting four years of 
college and that was a way of getting it. And you

15:45.156 --> 15:57.569
didn't think about that you had thirty years of 
military service that you're going to put in after

15:45.156 --> 15:57.569
you graduate from military academy. Primarily to 
economic. Let's start making comparisons then.

16:06.143 --> 16:09.166
You said that A&M was a good academic institution. 
How would you compare that with West Point? Well,

16:12.630 --> 16:15.513
I'd say West Point is very regimented. At the time 
it was very regimented. More so than A&M? Well, at

16:21.520 --> 16:24.042
A&M you did have a few choices. At West Point you had 
no choice. I mean, at the time that I went there, You

16:28.822 --> 16:33.448
took, everybody took exactly the same courses. 
And the only time that you deviated from taking the

16:33.468 --> 16:47.486
same course is if you were in the top 5% or something 
of this, some percentage. Then instead of taking

16:49.548 --> 16:55.656
final exams, you were given advanced courses like 
theory of least squares or something of this sort

16:56.817 --> 17:20.567
that you, in those fields, like if you were real 
good in mathematics, very obviously you could

16:56.817 --> 17:20.567
pass the final exam while you got a special course 
in something else. But otherwise you took exactly

17:20.588 --> 17:23.331
the same thing You're told exactly what to do every 
day, what time to go to bed, what time to get up, how

17:24.188 --> 17:35.602
to fix your bed, how to sweep your room. It's very, 
very regimented. Much less freedom than it is. Oh,

17:40.267 --> 17:41.609
yeah. No question about it. What about the 
qualities of teacher?

17:48.857 --> 17:49.318
Well.

17:52.943 --> 17:55.567
I'd say both of them are adequate. As far as 
architecture is concerned, you remember

17:55.988 --> 18:15.441
Professor Guise, some of the ones that you're 
interested in, but as far as who taught you the

17:55.988 --> 18:15.441
various courses and

18:18.205 --> 18:23.473
I mean I don't really remember or wasn't impressed 
or what have you. Whereas at the military academy

18:23.493 --> 18:41.682
you had former graduates who had gotten their 
master's degrees and who had gone out and had some

18:23.493 --> 18:41.682
experience and had come back to teach. And they 
were, some of them were real good, some of them were

18:49.795 --> 18:58.848
I'd say adequate, but I would think that all of them 
had exactly the same course to teach. They had

18:59.729 --> 19:06.979
their lesson plans laid out for them and in every 
class you did exactly the same thing. The only, see

19:08.661 --> 19:16.773
at West Point the difference, you were given a 
grade every week. Right. You were given a grade

19:18.128 --> 19:24.835
from 0 to 3.0. And

19:25.476 --> 19:30.882
every day that you attended class you got a grade. 
And on Saturday every week your grade points were

19:31.803 --> 19:39.051
posted. And about once a month while you shifted up 
and down the core in classes, based upon your grade

19:46.546 --> 19:55.458
points, so that the ones that made the highest 
grade all were congregated in class one. And the

19:56.199 --> 19:57.901
next ones in class two. I mean, in class two, in 
class three, in class four, in class five. And so

20:03.569 --> 20:11.980
that your ones that made the first grade were all in 
the same classroom.

20:14.272 --> 20:16.616
And I don't know, I'm really far that. I mean, I 
think that where you mix everybody up,

20:16.716 --> 20:39.550
why then you have to spend too much time on the 
students who are kind of dumb, and not enough time

20:16.716 --> 20:39.550
on the students who were outstanding. I always 
like to stay in about the second second class.

20:46.054 --> 20:57.104
Because the ones in the first class, they were 
always trying to be number one in the class, number

20:46.054 --> 20:57.104
two in the class, number three in the class. But as 
you get down to take off the first 15 people,

20:57.664 --> 21:13.118
then the rest of them were kind of indifferent as to 
what the guy next door was making.

21:15.393 --> 21:20.943
So at the military academy I was either in a high 
grade or I was in very low grade. In English I was

21:20.963 --> 21:31.241
down in the bottom, in French I was way down in the 
bottom.

21:31.261 --> 21:38.093
Well you thought that the, would you say that A&M, 
the quality of the teachers or professors that you

21:31.261 --> 21:38.093
had at A&M, versus West Point, would you put those 
on par? Would you say that we were better here or

21:41.773 --> 21:46.500
they were better there overall, if we could make a 
general statement?

21:50.305 --> 21:54.151
I would say that that one didn't impress me, 
actually. Your French professors were at the

21:56.334 --> 22:05.428
military academy and I didn't have any foreign 
language, I don't think. The French professors

22:05.448 --> 22:07.050
were Well, I mean, they were a French one.

22:13.403 --> 22:20.830
The ones that I had, Jenner in French, was very 
fluent in French. As far as I knew, as far as I was

22:21.510 --> 22:26.495
concerned, he was fluent. The ones in math were 
very good. But you were teaching exactly the same

22:33.402 --> 22:37.746
thing. Both institutions had a fairly close 
curriculum then. Yeah, I would say that I don't

22:43.180 --> 23:00.596
really remember other than architecture

22:43.180 --> 23:00.596
as to what kind of professors I had. Did you have any 
military science when you were at A&M? And I'm sure

23:04.319 --> 23:06.561
you had some at West Point. You must have had quite a 
bit at West Point. Did they teach the same type of

23:09.468 --> 23:12.611
course? Yeah, I would say so. Really, at the 
military academy, you don't have that much

23:15.975 --> 23:21.080
military science. I mean, you have maybe a two hour 
course once a week, or no more than twice a week. And

23:31.370 --> 23:39.238
you just didn't have that much military science 
anymore than you had at Texas A&M. they were pretty

23:39.539 --> 23:41.522
well balanced out. What about training, military 
training aspect of it? Now you were in the Corps

23:44.207 --> 23:49.836
here, and of course at West Point everybody is, so 
what about the training? Well, you're

23:50.677 --> 23:59.873
at the military academy, you're on the front row 
I'd say, more than you are at Texas A&M. What do you

24:00.333 --> 24:01.175
mean by that? Well, Path Aid News was always up 
there taking pictures and and the marching at West

24:06.674 --> 24:19.133
Point and the parades and it was a kind of glamour 
type of thing. Your folks back home every once in a

24:20.034 --> 24:33.234
while could go to Path 8 News at that time and to a 
movie and see you on the screen. They might not be

24:33.474 --> 24:35.938
able to recognize you but because you had 1,200 
people out there. And whereas

24:40.695 --> 24:50.964
Texas A&M, you just didn't get that kind of 
exposure.

24:56.289 --> 25:01.714
Was there any hazing at West Blanton, like the 
paddle at A&M? They never touched you. They never

25:03.096 --> 25:05.638
touched you. What about mental hazing? Oh, well, 
it was mostly mental hazing, but... Can you give

25:07.065 --> 25:11.092
them an example? Well, they'd make you pull your 
chin in, pop your chest out, suck your gut up, and

25:11.592 --> 25:32.065
keep your eyes to the front, and

25:11.592 --> 25:32.065
some little guy, you know, about five feet forward 
would come up to the tallest and look your way up and

25:32.483 --> 25:46.439
look up into your, and try to haze it and you'd 
almost feel like patting him on the head and say,

25:32.483 --> 25:46.439
just take it easy son, I'll get my chin in. You had 
that type of hazing at the dinner table where you

25:48.582 --> 26:01.457
always had to sit on the front part of your chair and 
eat

25:48.582 --> 26:01.457
by the squares. You had to pick it up, come up, and

26:02.538 --> 26:09.949
it really wasn't bad. I mean, in Beast Barracks up 
there, I think I gained about 15 pounds. Oh, you

26:15.537 --> 26:16.098
did? Oh, yeah. After getting out of Texas A&M and 
the studying I did there, when you get on

26:16.819 --> 26:31.701
going to bed at 10 o'clock, getting up at 6, I had 
good food, no financial worries. I gained weight.

26:40.463 --> 26:41.924
Normally, you don't. But I thoroughly enjoyed 
that restaurant. In fact, I, yeah.

26:49.112 --> 26:57.402
Why don't they, here at A&M, they used to get away 
with physical contact as far as hazing Was that

26:57.753 --> 27:02.181
against the rules and regulations at West Point or 
why didn't they use that? I'm sure it was against

27:02.381 --> 27:05.707
the rules. They couldn't touch it. Before they 
could even pick anything off your string,

27:08.111 --> 27:16.345
anything off your uniform, they'd have to ask your 
permission to touch it.

27:20.933 --> 27:22.275
So I would say The fish year at Texas A&M at that time 
was a lot more difficult than the plebe year at West

27:22.812 --> 27:29.922
Point. How about marching and other types of 
military training? Can you compare that with A&M

27:36.191 --> 27:38.174
and West Point? Well, your marching, see I really 
can't compare because I was a day student. At West

27:47.428 --> 27:50.372
Point, while you marched, At Reveille you had a 
formation. And then you marched to Mass. And you

27:57.992 --> 28:03.759
marched to class. And so that all your marching was 
done that way. You really, and then you had twice a

28:11.288 --> 28:17.676
week or something, military formations where you 
marched on the parade ground and every Saturday

28:18.382 --> 28:25.852
you had a parade and review type of thing.

28:31.620 --> 28:36.127
Whereas I didn't march to the mess hall at Texas 
A&M. Now maybe they did at the time, I don't know

28:36.147 --> 28:42.536
being a day student. What about the students? You 
had student colleagues here, and of course, for

28:44.977 --> 28:49.702
three years you had student colleagues at West 
Point. Could you compare them?

28:54.327 --> 28:58.332
Well, as far as I was concerned, they were all about 
the same. You had students at the military academy

28:59.453 --> 29:09.164
whose parents had sent them there, because that's 
the place to go. I'd say a large percentage of those

29:09.584 --> 29:14.950
washed out, because they really didn't

29:16.010 --> 29:21.996
want to be there in the first place.

29:23.477 --> 29:32.326
But I would say probably 60 or 70% of the people were 
in the same boat as I. I mean, they were there to get

29:23.477 --> 29:32.326
an education. They didn't have a lot of money. 
Their parents didn't have a lot of money. I

29:37.311 --> 29:42.996
borrowed $300. for a deposit when I went to West 
Point. And from the same bank, First National

29:50.252 --> 29:58.365
Bank, and I paid them back after I graduated four 
years later, plus all the interest. But I would say

29:58.385 --> 30:11.245
that the caliber of people are, there's really no 
difference between the ones that went to Texas A&M

29:58.385 --> 30:11.245
and the ones that went to Military Academy. You 
know, I would have thought that the ones who went to

30:11.410 --> 30:31.630
Texas A&M would have been much more rural 
backgrounds, probably with less, their parents

30:11.410 --> 30:31.630
having less money and where the ones from West 
Point would have more political contacts and

30:11.410 --> 30:31.630
maybe more urban and maybe their parents would 
have had more money, or would have maybe been in

30:32.048 --> 30:42.139
more occupations like business, but you didn't 
find that true? Well, see, you don't come in

30:42.519 --> 30:59.878
contact with the parents really very much, 
because, see, you're from Florida and Texas and

30:42.519 --> 30:59.878
California and Hawaii and the Philippines, and so 
you're so far away, you really don't come in

30:42.519 --> 30:59.878
contact with... with the parents very much. Now, 
the ones that lived around

31:02.333 --> 31:14.887
West Point in the northeast, the only thing you 
remember about them is always bringing up what we

31:02.333 --> 31:14.887
called boodle. I mean, that's cakes and pie. Oh, 
sure. And so after somebody's parents were up

31:17.489 --> 31:27.320
there, we'd gather in their rooms and consume all 
of this, the sweets that they had brought up. As far

31:28.562 --> 31:29.663
as big...
