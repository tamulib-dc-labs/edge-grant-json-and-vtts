WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:09.340
cable company and so we wrapped around and 
stretched them and it would have been pretty

00:03.153 --> 00:09.340
difficult for it to move. I mean they would, the 
tradition back then was, you know, if it's still

00:09.380 --> 00:23.215
standing when the sun comes up, you know, we'll 
probably win the game or something because those

00:09.380 --> 00:23.215
things were so bound together that it was pretty 
hard for them to move. Was anybody, do you remember

00:25.578 --> 00:28.761
any injuries during your four years? Oh yeah, we 
had guys that were injured but not What kind of

00:32.920 --> 00:35.343
injuries? I don't know if anything serious. I 
mean, there's guys that would not move their hands

00:36.725 --> 00:46.618
around and get caught as they were loading 
something on the truck and I'm sure there were some

00:36.725 --> 00:46.618
broken bones and a few things like that. I remember 
we had one kid, when I was a sophomore, there was a

00:46.638 --> 01:01.257
kid that lived, this is unbelievable, I mean, we 
lived on the third floor and there was a fish next to

00:46.638 --> 01:01.257
us and he was He always seemed kind of depressed, 
just about everything. And all of a sudden, one

01:05.164 --> 01:13.014
day, his old lady comes in and says, Mr. Sharp, Fish 
Cardinal, I think was his name. Probably ought not

01:14.136 --> 01:17.700
to use his name, but he just tried to commit 
suicide. And this kid had jumped face first out of

01:17.720 --> 01:22.486
the dorm window onto the ground. And I looked down 
there, and there was this kid spread out on the

01:22.506 --> 01:24.949
ground. And fortunately, it had rained a lot the 
day before, and he hit it, and it kind of was mud, and

01:25.672 --> 01:34.321
we revived him, and then he left school right after 
that. That was the kind of thing. And at that point

01:39.726 --> 01:48.976
with Bonfire, did any of y'all worry about the 
possibility of a serious, serious accident? No. I

01:51.098 --> 01:52.860
don't ever remember even thinking about it. as you 
think back about Bonfire, what importance, what

01:53.566 --> 02:03.781
does Bonfire's importance value to A&M? Well, you 
know, I told you before about how those Walton Hall

02:03.801 --> 02:10.551
and some of those folks got by. I mean, I will 
guarantee you that a whole bunch of former

02:10.691 --> 02:19.624
students of A&M would take a look at some of their 
best friends right now 20 years or 30 years later,

02:20.701 --> 02:30.934
if you think about it, go back and there are people 
they work right next to in building that. For the

02:31.635 --> 02:40.986
core, the bonfire, a lot of part of the bonfire was 
putting to the test all those leadership skills

02:31.635 --> 02:40.986
that you've been learning for four or five years. I 
mean it was the first practical way you had to do

02:45.288 --> 02:45.709
this? Is somebody going to take orders? Are they 
going to be disciplined enough to do exactly what

02:47.151 --> 02:49.755
you say? Stay away from the chainsaws and don't 
move the truck till we tell you and all this kind of

02:49.795 --> 02:54.642
stuff. Can you take orders and can you follow 
orders? And I think that was probably a big reason

02:56.705 --> 03:06.419
that we never got, we always got people hurt, I'm 
sure, but I don't remember any catastrophic deal.

03:06.720 --> 03:12.148
And how long during your years, how long did an 
individual work on Bonfire? Oh, some. A month?

03:15.241 --> 03:20.307
Some for a month, you know, go to class sometimes 
and go work on it. But all of us would work on it for,

03:20.327 --> 03:23.951
you know, a couple weeks. But somebody was out 
there in October, you know, cutting trees down and

03:25.032 --> 03:29.878
getting them ready. See, I think this last year or 
two, I think it started Labor Day. Yeah. It had

03:34.864 --> 03:36.306
gotten bigger, bigger, bigger. Yeah, they didn't 
talk about it much, but they were all out there

03:36.326 --> 03:40.170
doing that stuff. I mean, right now, the kids are 
coming to guys like me and gathered up money for the

03:44.097 --> 03:49.484
next year's bonfire to pay for equipment and 
stuff. It's been the better part of a year working

03:50.926 --> 03:53.329
on it one form or another. Let's see. Bonfire, 
silver taps,

03:54.290 --> 04:00.478
midnight ale practice.

04:03.341 --> 04:05.284
How much did your senior ring cost? About $90. The 
rumor back then was, everybody couldn't believe

04:09.329 --> 04:13.294
how cheap they were, and the rumor then was that the 
Association of Farmer Students pays half of it. If

04:16.402 --> 04:24.309
you go to my vintage at A&M and older, they still 
believe that the Association of Farmer Students

04:16.402 --> 04:24.309
paid half of that ring. And it's never been true, 
best I can tell. How did you feel about that ring

04:28.333 --> 04:31.356
when you first got it? I remember exactly where I 
was in the Koch building when I put it on. Picked it

04:35.159 --> 04:36.620
up, put it on. I know one guy that got his 95 hours and 
quit school. All he wanted was the ring. He didn't

04:41.264 --> 04:43.146
give a damn about the diploma. But I have an 
interesting ring story though. I get

04:46.084 --> 04:49.507
my ring. I go duck hunting and I've got this red 
Irish Setter that stubborn, won't go in the water.

04:58.536 --> 05:01.079
It's cold and when it's cold your hands shrink. 
This is a few years after I was graduated. And I'm

05:05.463 --> 05:11.749
holding the dog with my left hand and I'm pointing 
to the duck in this 20 foot deep canal. And I go like

05:12.218 --> 05:18.326
this, you know, swing my hand, go get it, and the 
ring flew off and went into this canal. And it was

05:19.307 --> 05:21.650
about 30 degrees. I took all my clothes off. I beat 
the dog around the head and shoulders and dove in

05:23.472 --> 05:28.899
that stupid rice pond. And the mud was, must have 
been 10 foot deep. I never could find it. It just

05:33.065 --> 05:34.607
liked to kill me. Well, so I ordered another ring. I 
put the ring on. Da-da-da-da-da-da, I go down the

05:39.934 --> 05:41.095
road. Years later, actually in 1998, I think it 
was, might have been 97, I had this Aggie named J.D.

05:53.183 --> 05:56.969
Salinas who worked for me as a controller when I was 
a controller. And he's flying from Laredo to

05:58.712 --> 06:01.717
Hidalgo County with me. And we're in a little plane 
and he gets sick of his stomach. And he throws up in

06:05.847 --> 06:08.890
my lap in the back of that plane. And I said, 
Salinas, how long have you been working for me not

06:08.910 --> 06:12.654
counting today? And I said, here's what you do. You 
know, I said, he was sitting over here and I put my

06:15.877 --> 06:21.603
ring up above him on the ceiling of the plane. I 
said, just stare at my ring and concentrate on it.

06:25.167 --> 06:25.868
Count the stars. Do anything you can. Just 
concentrate on that ring and you won't be sick.

06:29.611 --> 06:32.855
We're going to land here in about 10 minutes and 
just don't do this to me again. After we landed, He

06:35.750 --> 06:38.073
said, I got a question for you. You older Aggies, 
y'all got different rings than we got, right? And I

06:41.638 --> 06:43.661
said, no, it's the same ring. Class of 91 has the 
same ring. Class of 72 has and all this kind of

06:46.164 --> 06:49.108
stuff. And he said, no, your ring's backward. And I 
said, what are you talking about, my ring's

06:52.413 --> 06:54.455
backwards? It's just like yours. We took the ring 
off, and on all Aggie rings, the guns are over here,

06:55.837 --> 07:04.609
and the star is over here, except mine. And I looked 
at that, and I looked at his ring. There were two

07:08.011 --> 07:10.476
other Aggies that worked in that office. I called 
them in. I said, bring your rings in here. We had a

07:12.359 --> 07:13.281
major emergency. I looked at it, and my ring was 
totally reversed. And so I called the ring clerk.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.836
This was on a Friday afternoon. I called the ring 
clerk, and I said, look, did something go on back

07:21.856 --> 07:29.370
when I was there that caused this to happen, all 
this kind of stuff? And I explained it to her, and

07:29.390 --> 07:30.732
she said, Jimmy, we got another one. And she just 
hollered at the back and said, you know, we've had

07:33.367 --> 07:40.254
three of these or whatever it is, but all of them 
have been corrected. So just bring yours in and

07:40.274 --> 07:42.277
we'll get it corrected. And I was on my way down to 
get it corrected and I thought, no, wait a minute.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.222
I'm going to keep it. So I kept it. And as best I know, 
this only Aggie ring like that is completely

07:48.183 --> 07:53.588
reversed. The guns, my guns, as the ring faces out 
with the numbers, the guns are supposed to be on the

07:59.973 --> 08:05.398
right side and the star is supposed to be on the left 
and mine is just the opposite of that. But it's

08:05.418 --> 08:09.422
exactly the same... Everything else is exactly 
the same. It's all the same stuff just a

08:09.482 --> 08:20.852
different... What happened was this crest 
probably goes on last and whoever did it reversed

08:09.482 --> 08:20.852
the crest. I'm trying to think of all the events and 
or traditions that are important to A&M. Final

08:29.588 --> 08:31.290
review. Is that important? Oh, yeah. Describe 
what it meant to go through final review. It was a

08:37.377 --> 08:39.800
real sad day for me. I remember that day. I remember 
that I was... First did your junior year. Yeah, but

08:44.966 --> 08:47.208
my senior year is when it was real sad. Junior year 
was a happy deal because, boy, all of a sudden you

08:47.248 --> 08:51.814
take your shoes off and you're walking on grass. 
Boy, what a wonderful feeling. No, the junior year

08:53.816 --> 08:57.300
was great because... Well, I knew by that time that 
my senior year I was going to be on core staff and,

08:57.955 --> 09:06.062
you know, that it was going to be lots of fun. And it 
was a little bit sad in the extent that I was leaving

09:06.122 --> 09:11.888
my outfit and going to another dormitory and 
stuff. But junior year was lots of fun. I mean, you

09:15.231 --> 09:18.534
just lived from the time that you do your first 
push-up. You lived the time you put those boots on.

09:21.236 --> 09:25.400
And so, you know, by then we'd already bought our 
boots. Where did you get yours? I actually bought

09:27.284 --> 09:32.576
mine from another senior, a guy named Richardson, 
in an outfit down below. What did you pay for it? Oh,

09:36.103 --> 09:36.905
I don't know. I think maybe $150 or something. Did 
you sell them or keep them? I kept them. I bronzed

09:41.475 --> 09:42.076
them. You still have them? I still have them. I 
bronzed them and made lampshades out of them. Why

09:45.885 --> 09:47.368
are eggy boots important? They cost a lot, not in 
terms of dollars. Hey, that's a good thought. I

09:55.335 --> 09:55.576
like that. I don't have anything that I spent more 
money on than that. I mean more sweat equity on than

09:58.099 --> 10:01.063
those Aggie boots. But I did agree. I had a saber 
because I was on staff and saber harness and all

10:03.686 --> 10:09.694
that kind of stuff and I did agree to sell them to a 
junior in my outfit and he'd agree that it was all

10:09.877 --> 10:34.534
brand new, the Sabre, I mean the Sabre holster, I 
wasn't going to sell the Sabre because I still have

10:09.877 --> 10:34.534
that right next to the boots but I agreed to sell 
everything else for two or three hundred dollars

10:09.877 --> 10:34.534
whatever it was and I remember I was so sad at the end 
of that that when that guy, that junior comes up and

10:09.877 --> 10:34.534
says hey give me your spurs and give me your, you 
know, harness and all this kind of stuff and here's

10:34.835 --> 10:39.500
the money. I told him to keep the money and give it, 
and I said you can keep that money if you promise to

10:39.540 --> 10:45.086
give this to somebody else next year. So as far as I 
know they may still be on campus if somebody's

10:45.127 --> 10:48.050
honored that. But it, that was, that was real sad. 
May 6, 1972 was the day I graduated and it was...

10:58.421 --> 10:59.863
Describe commencement. Well, everybody came. I 
mean, I don't know if they still come now, but there

11:02.381 --> 11:09.087
wasn't anybody that didn't show up at 
commencement.

11:11.249 --> 11:22.179
When I got across the stage and Jack Williams 
handed me my diploma, I get off the stage and I'm out

11:11.249 --> 11:22.179
in the parking lot and I said, boy, I just got to take 
a look at it. I opened it up and the tube was empty.

11:26.102 --> 11:31.167
And so I called Lacey, Bob Lacey, who was Cooper's 
guy over there, and said, hey, What is the deal with

11:31.822 --> 11:33.865
my diploma? And he said, I had taken a 
correspondence course from UT and barely got it in

11:34.806 --> 11:42.516
in time. And he didn't think I was going to get it in 
in time. And so they didn't order one. And so I got

11:48.203 --> 11:51.507
mine about two or three days later or something 
like that. How big a crowd came from your family and

11:52.108 --> 11:55.452
friends? Well, everybody. Everybody. I mean, any 
cousin I ever met, everybody was there. My brother

12:01.538 --> 12:06.905
was making, fooling himself, screaming, knock 
him out, John, or whatever it was. He was hollering

12:06.965 --> 12:08.527
and stuff like that. No, G. Riley White was 
absolutely full, standing room only. Is it

12:12.232 --> 12:14.555
important that every name is called, every hand? 
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. But everybody walks across

12:17.880 --> 12:19.822
the state. And I just thought of the name of that 
football announcer, C.K. Weston. CK what? Esten.

12:26.150 --> 12:27.071
Oh, CK Esten. Yeah, that's right. Good afternoon, 
football fans. Welcome to Kyleville. Because I

12:31.236 --> 12:44.651
think a year or so before you got here, what he would 
do is he would flip the mic off and then say

12:31.236 --> 12:44.651
something with some three- and four-letter words 
in it with the mic turned off. One day, he said, that

12:44.991 --> 12:50.698
ought to take the son of a bitch's... And Rutter 
summoned him to his office on Monday. And he was

12:56.202 --> 12:58.285
scared to death. And he went in and Rutter told him 
to come in and sit down. And Rutter stared a hole

13:03.633 --> 13:10.121
through him as he was going through the chair in 
fear. And then Rutter burst out laughing at him.

13:14.455 --> 13:18.179
and then told him, look, you know darn good and 
well, now don't ever do that again. It was funny.

13:20.822 --> 13:24.926
I'll tell you the story I was going to tell you about 
Les Appel. When I was a senior, the University of

13:24.946 --> 13:32.013
Texas had done away, or were doing away with their 
student government. Remember when Bob Binder and

13:32.033 --> 13:35.096
all those people just abolished the student 
government? And they had decided they wanted to

13:36.258 --> 13:39.521
rename the student senate. Before they did that, 
they had voted to rename

13:44.628 --> 13:46.790
Their mascot, the Armadillo, remember that? 
Well, Saturday morning before a game, or maybe

13:48.552 --> 14:01.265
Sunday morning after a game, I was giving one of 
those speeches to the Association of Former

13:48.552 --> 14:01.265
Students, after one of the games, and Les Appelt, 
at the time, was president of the Association of

13:48.552 --> 14:01.265
Former Students. I think they had just built maybe 
Appelt Hall, or maybe were fixing to, but anyway,

14:02.767 --> 14:09.154
he was president of the Association at the time. 
And boy, I felt real bad. It was a Sunday morning,

14:12.137 --> 14:14.179
and we'd I'd probably been awake two hours before 
that. And he comes up to me afterwards and he said,

14:18.821 --> 14:23.145
boy, you're in bad shape this morning, aren't you? 
I said, yes, I sure am. And he said, well, let's go

14:25.027 --> 14:27.429
out and get some breakfast somewhere. I've got an 
idea I want to run by you. And I said, what's that?

14:29.631 --> 14:37.999
And he said, well, you know, UTU is thinking about 
doing away with these longhorn and putting in

14:29.631 --> 14:37.999
armadillos. And I said, yeah, isn't that the 
stupidest thing you ever heard? And he said, yes,

14:40.041 --> 14:42.343
and we need to capitalize on that. And I said, what 
do you have in mind, Mr. Appleton? He said, I want

14:44.586 --> 14:51.136
you to go out and print 5,000 or so bumper stickers. 
Do you remember those? Were you hearing one of

14:51.817 --> 14:53.079
those bumper stickers? They were everywhere on 
campus. And a little armadillo, orange armadillo

14:54.882 --> 14:58.968
digging, and it said, dig them dillos. We printed 
5,000 of them. Les just loved them. I sent it to

15:03.235 --> 15:04.377
Houston. He said, oh, God, we've got to have more. 
So he printed 20,000 more, 25,000 bumper

15:05.999 --> 15:09.124
stickers. They were all over the bonfire. They 
were all over on the helmets working on the bonfire

15:11.009 --> 15:13.913
and the whole bit. And he called me about a week 
before the game. He said, I want you to get some

15:16.556 --> 15:19.279
freshmen. And I want one of those on every car in the 
parking lot at Kyle Field the day of the game. He

15:23.844 --> 15:24.946
said, I don't care how many freshmen. I'll pay for 
it. Whatever's got to happen, you get that done. I

15:27.489 --> 15:28.890
said, OK. Get it done. He prints 10,000 more. About 
four days before the game, He drives down to

15:35.260 --> 15:38.843
college station and he said, he got me a new idea, 
Sharp. And I said, what's that? He said, I want you

15:40.445 --> 15:42.627
to go find some armadillo. And I want these 
freshmen to get them. I want about 20 or 30 of them.

15:46.931 --> 15:48.393
And I want you to spray, remember this? I want you to 
spray paint them, burn orange, and I want them

15:48.553 --> 15:55.139
released on the field while the UT band is in the 
middle of the field. And I said, okay, may have to

15:56.461 --> 15:59.364
pay for this one. These armadillos are hard to 
find. He said, whatever. Hang no expense. I said,

16:03.688 --> 16:04.850
okay. So I get two outfits of freshmen, buy them 
some, I'm sure it was Cokes or Dr. Pepper, to go out

16:04.870 --> 16:12.427
into the woods. And they did. They came up with 32 
armadillos. And we spray painted them. burnt

16:18.713 --> 16:26.704
orange, and I'm sitting up in the stands of my date 
thinking, okay, let's see how this works out. And

16:27.225 --> 16:33.394
here come these freshmen, four foot lockers full 
of armadillos, one from the east, one from the

16:27.225 --> 16:33.394
west, one from the north, one from the south. 
Here's the UT band with big berth of block T

16:33.414 --> 16:45.852
formation the whole bit, and boom, they dump out 
these armadillos, and they herd them toward the

16:33.414 --> 16:45.852
band, and the armadillos run from four sides into 
the band. I don't know if you remember this or not,

16:46.355 --> 16:48.839
but that band quit the field. I mean, it disrupted 
halftime. And I and one of yours and mine's

16:53.406 --> 17:03.021
favorite administrators came up into the stands 
and said, you've

16:53.406 --> 17:03.021
got real trouble here. And I said, why are you 
talking to me, Dean? He said, well, because the

17:04.804 --> 17:11.214
first, second, third, fourth, and fifth freshman 
that we caught immediately said, you the guy. Was

17:12.055 --> 17:12.776
this Coldis? Hannigan. Oh, this is... And I said, 
yeah, well, nothing bad going to happen, is it? And

17:22.079 --> 17:24.722
he said, well, you could get kicked out of school 
for something like that. And I said, oh, then we've

17:25.523 --> 17:27.526
got a real big problem. And he said, what's that? 
And I said, the President's Association for

17:28.747 --> 17:31.330
Student Finance. He said, you've got to be 
kidding. Apparently, from what I heard, goes up

17:35.195 --> 17:40.581
into the press box and asked Les about it. And Les 
was still bragging about it. I mean, he told

17:42.423 --> 17:43.385
everybody. He said, watch this. Watch what's 
fixing to happen. He goes in there, and Dean

17:45.603 --> 17:51.231
Hannigan does some kind of deal, said, did you see 
the armadillo? Wasn't that just the best BS you

17:51.251 --> 17:55.037
have ever seen in your whole life? And Dean said, 
yes, sir, it certainly was. And so Dean comes up and

17:57.300 --> 18:02.027
said, this didn't even happen, did it, Sharp? I 
said, no, sir, I didn't see nothing. No, that was

18:04.351 --> 18:05.172
good. No, that's a good one. And it did not make a 
single paper in the state. How they did that, I

18:09.458 --> 18:13.264
don't know, but it was good. It would make a few 
newspapers in the world today. Oh, my God. Isn't

18:18.177 --> 18:19.220
that the truth? I mean, I bought every paper I could 
thinking, oh, Lord, we're in trouble. All right.

18:25.597 --> 18:30.642
Back to the, let's see, one last tradition that I 
had not mentioned is muster. Do you remember when

18:31.643 --> 18:34.505
you first went to a muster? Yep, I do. Back then it 
was being held on the front of the systems building

18:36.367 --> 18:40.811
out here. It's where we had the muster. And I can't 
remember who the muster speaker was. The most

18:47.738 --> 18:54.304
memorable muster speaker was, we had... Max 
Cleland, when he had just returned from Vietnam,

18:56.258 --> 19:00.522
and now a U.S. Senator, but he had just returned 
from Vietnam and had his legs. I think he was one of

19:03.865 --> 19:06.767
the speakers. But the most memorable muster was 
the one after Rutter died, when they called his

19:07.047 --> 19:21.059
name and the entire student body, 10,000 people, 
whatever it was, answered here for him. But I think

19:21.139 --> 19:25.303
my junior year was moved into G. Raleigh. And that 
was the year I was in charge. The student life

19:27.610 --> 19:31.918
chairman had to put on the muster and that's where 
we're from. And do you think muster is an important

19:31.938 --> 19:34.282
tradition at A&M? Oh yeah. I think all those 
traditions, particularly muster is. What is the

19:42.255 --> 19:45.180
central factor of all of those? Of all the 
traditions? Bonding with each other. Every one of

19:49.287 --> 19:51.190
them have to do with You're not just another person 
in the world that we don't care anything about.

19:57.911 --> 19:58.612
You're an Aggie. We, even if I never met you, we went 
through things together that were similar and

19:58.632 --> 20:16.675
there's a reason that if I have any kind of way to 
show preference toward you, I'm going to do it over

19:58.632 --> 20:16.675
somebody else and not be shameful about it. What 
creates Aggie spirit? No. What is Aggie Spirit?

20:23.411 --> 20:25.493
Boy, I'd like to find a person that can define that. 
I'm not sure you can put a definition of it, but from

20:25.553 --> 20:48.885
my perspective as I went through this institution 
and granted leaning heavily on experiences in the

20:25.553 --> 20:48.885
core, I think a big part of what creates Aggie 
Spirit is folks that go through the same trials

20:25.553 --> 20:48.885
together. and learned that I think Aggie spirit is 
just the opposite of individualism. Instead of

20:55.074 --> 21:01.600
being caught up in yourself, you're caught up in a 
family, a whole big family. And I think, and it's

21:01.620 --> 21:10.890
not, I mean, it's not just a myth that people, that 
once you get out, you forget about it because I've

21:01.620 --> 21:10.890
seen it. I've given it and I've received it. I mean, 
I know there are people People that would call me

21:16.034 --> 21:35.950
from when I first ran for controller and didn't run 
against, it's a different deal when you run

21:16.034 --> 21:35.950
against, you know, two Aggies that run against 
each other, but when, you know, when I first ran for

21:16.034 --> 21:35.950
controller or railroad commissioner, I mean, I 
get people call me up, call me up that was a chairman

21:16.034 --> 21:35.950
of the Republican Party in one county and said, 
I'll resign if you want me to, or I can just work for

21:36.689 --> 21:41.115
you behind the scenes, or whatever you need. It's a 
bond stronger than anything else you can find

21:41.175 --> 21:46.683
short of religion. Might almost be.

21:52.391 --> 21:58.459
Were you aware this was developing within you when 
you were an undergraduate?

22:00.162 --> 22:02.004
When did you begin to feel this?

22:05.669 --> 22:06.190
I don't know. I'm sure we all noticed it was 
happening when we were there just because we were

22:06.743 --> 22:32.818
good friends but keep in mind most of us that I ran 
around with were people who outside our universe

22:06.743 --> 22:32.818
of a couple hundred kids in high school didn't know 
anybody else so this was our first thrust out into

22:06.743 --> 22:32.818
the world we didn't know if this was usual or 
unusual and stuff like that until we kind of got out

22:06.743 --> 22:32.818
into the world and found out that there's nothing 
nothing like this deal. But yeah, I think you

22:35.614 --> 22:53.102
experience the first time two or three of you are 
dressed down or humiliated or have to go through

22:35.614 --> 22:53.102
some common obstacle together is when it first 
starts bonding. And I guess maybe it grows a little

22:53.122 --> 22:59.953
more when you get out and you find out that nobody 
else has been through this but you. I'm not even

23:01.098 --> 23:03.401
sure Aggie jokes aren't helpful. It brings 
people... Do you and your close friends think it's

23:05.965 --> 23:15.600
okay for Aggies to tell Aggie jokes when they're 
only Aggies in the room? When they're only Aggies?

23:18.083 --> 23:22.610
Yeah, most of them I'd say when they're only 
Aggies, but if it's somebody who starts telling

23:18.083 --> 23:22.610
them... I mean, you could have ten Aggies in the 
room and they might tell one or two or something,

23:22.630 --> 23:25.975
but if Some other guy says, well, I want to join in, 
and then nobody laughs at that. That's what I've

23:30.703 --> 23:38.835
told people, that it's okay for an Aggie to tell an 
Aggie joke if it's within an Aggie setting, but no

23:30.703 --> 23:38.835
outsider. But sometimes that doesn't fly too 
well. Yeah,

23:41.418 --> 23:46.005
nobody likes outsiders. I mean, I don't allow my 
family to tell Aggie jokes. Now, what propelled

23:51.012 --> 23:54.477
you into leadership? and on the campus? Poor, one 
way or the other. Okay. I mean, it was, I mean, I, I,

24:01.202 --> 24:12.500
people always ask you, said, God, why'd you get 
into politics? All this stuff you have to go

24:12.580 --> 24:17.547
through and all this stuff people say about you and 
dig up, you know, and all this kind of stuff. And my

24:17.608 --> 24:21.173
response to that, after thinking about it a long 
time, is that I have never had any opponent for a

24:22.368 --> 24:30.800
political office be to me as mean and nasty as the 
weakest sophomore in my outfit was. I

24:31.982 --> 24:50.569
think

24:31.982 --> 24:50.569
I learned during that time to filter what's 
important and what's not, and so you get some bozo

24:31.982 --> 24:50.569
running against you that's screaming and 
hollering about this or that. You're not even in

24:50.633 --> 24:57.201
the same league with the people that were 
screaming at me every morning for a year or two. It

24:58.863 --> 25:00.365
kind of toughens you a little. Early on, did you 
dream of running for student body president or

25:00.385 --> 25:07.694
corps commander or what? No, I probably didn't 
start thinking about that until my sophomore year

25:07.855 --> 25:14.463
when I was elected sophomore class president. 
And... And... I would say shortly after that,

25:19.186 --> 25:23.830
though, I thought there was an opportunity to be. 
All right. Why a student body president instead of

25:24.531 --> 25:26.733
a corps commander?

25:29.415 --> 25:36.461
If you'd had a choice, I presume you picked, you 
sought the one you wanted more? I don't know. I

25:36.982 --> 25:42.547
think it's two different sets of skills. I mean, 
you can, political skills, getting along with

25:42.607 --> 25:47.691
people and stuff like that, you know, work fine and 
getting things done. Things don't happen in the

25:53.010 --> 25:55.673
Corps and the military through compromise. 
Describe how you went about organizing to get

25:57.435 --> 26:04.443
ready to run for student body president. Describe 
how you organized it and your campaign and so

26:04.463 --> 26:08.108
forth. Well, there were, there were, I have, I've 
said on numerous occasions that politics at A&M is

26:17.860 --> 26:24.669
much more difficult and much more intertwined 
than anything you'll experience in Texas. I mean

26:24.689 --> 26:45.555
in Texas you've got South Texas that's much 
different from East Texas and Dallas and Houston

26:24.689 --> 26:45.555
that are different and San Antonio is different 
and the Panhandle is different and stuff like that

26:24.689 --> 26:45.555
but at A&M you had the Corps and if you had the Corps 
and they were happy that's a pretty serious block

26:24.689 --> 26:45.555
vote so you had to be number one in their eyes And if 
you did that back then, you were well on your way.

26:50.185 --> 26:55.951
But you also had the dormitories that worked on the 
bonfire. And then you had folks that didn't work on

26:55.971 --> 27:02.899
the bonfire that were kind of kickers, you know, 
the country folks and folks like that. You had the

27:03.600 --> 27:10.268
jocks that didn't pay much attention to anything 
outside of Caulfield or G. Riley White. You had

27:11.049 --> 27:13.011
folks that lived off campus. And then you had folks 
who lived off campus that were married that never

27:13.700 --> 27:20.035
came on the campus except to take courses and stuff 
like that. And you had folks that were for the

27:21.078 --> 27:23.444
bonfire. You had some folks, believe it or not, 
even back then, that were against it. And so you had

27:28.275 --> 27:31.523
to figure out ways do that stuff. We organized, 
actually it was kind of between mine and

27:33.113 --> 27:36.977
Caperton's administration. Kent was right 
before me. We put like, I don't know if they still

27:40.701 --> 27:47.228
have refrigerators in the room, but the student 
government used to own those refrigerators and

27:40.701 --> 27:47.228
rent them to the student. The bus system that was 
first put in was put in my senior year. We proved

27:52.474 --> 27:53.535
that. I forget, some outfit out of Austin, 
Enterprise Transportation or something like

27:53.695 --> 28:01.864
that, where the buses that now run kind of stem from 
all that stuff. As you're getting ready to

28:07.607 --> 28:16.099
organize your campaign to run for, who did you 
have, what kind of supporting organization did

28:07.607 --> 28:16.099
you try to create? I would go, I went to those, all 
those clubs that I was a member of because I didn't

28:16.981 --> 28:23.730
want to eat in Duncan Dining Hall. Back to those 
groups. But the Corps then, I mean if you, the Corps

28:27.555 --> 28:31.581
didn't split its votes. And my guess is they 
probably don't now, but I don't know. And who were

28:35.374 --> 28:36.835
your primary opponents? Well, Roger Miller. And 
he was a civilian student? He was vice president of

28:42.442 --> 28:44.284
the student body. He was Kent's roommate. And so he 
should have been heir to the civilian side of

28:46.486 --> 28:53.354
campus, which theoretically had a lot more votes. 
But I was able to go into the civilian side because I

28:54.335 --> 29:01.163
was in those clubs or because of, his position on 
Bonfire or whatever, in order to take some of those

29:01.615 --> 29:13.694
off, and he would, he could never have been 
successful in taking any significant number of

29:01.615 --> 29:13.694
core votes away from me. Alright, so there were 
only two of you. Did you have a slate of some of the

29:15.236 --> 29:18.421
candidates? Not that year. The year before we had 
that deal with Kent started. And did the core, was

29:23.509 --> 29:28.517
there any kind of action the core leadership took 
to endorse you? You mean like a primary? Or a

29:31.497 --> 29:35.683
resolution, or did they pass the word? Ah, yeah. 
Well, there were rumors, of course, that the Corps

29:37.786 --> 29:53.588
held a primary, that the Yale leaders would go to 
each dorm and poll the seniors, or soon-to-be

29:37.786 --> 29:53.588
seniors, and say, okay, you've got a couple of guys 
in the Corps that want to run. One is David Moore,

29:53.608 --> 29:58.875
who's on Corps staff, and the other one is this guy 
named Sharp who did. And the rumors were that you

29:59.648 --> 30:05.397
would go to those guys and say, we can't have two 
from the Corps. Which one would y'all do? And the

30:07.740 --> 30:10.204
L.A.ers would tabulate that. Sure rumor, of 
course. During the campaign, about how long did it

30:13.910 --> 30:16.414
last? Oh, three months. Three, four months. So 
there were posters and placards. Yeah, posters

30:25.367 --> 30:27.070
and placards. Ads in the back. Oh no, it cost money. 
Slipped flyers under the doors. Rallies, we'd go

30:35.310 --> 30:39.014
to one side of campus and speak, the other side of 
campus and speak. Were there any, there were no

30:39.415 --> 30:44.000
presidential debates. We'd do it at the 
battalion. They'd go to the battalion and they'd

30:47.685 --> 30:51.990
ask us questions or maybe a panel of folks ask us 
questions. Nothing on the radio? No. Okay. There

30:55.960 --> 30:57.803
was a limit to what we could spend. I think it was 
like $2,000 or something like that. But there were

31:01.308 --> 31:11.383
no MSC ballroom open big sessions where the two of 
you made speeches to the same crowd? One, but it

31:12.184 --> 31:13.947
wasn't at the MSC. It was in front of Walton Hall. 
They had a big trailer out there. Anybody wanted to

31:18.955 --> 31:23.301
run would come out and talk to whoever showed up to 
listen. Which usually wasn't too many listening.

31:26.364 --> 31:32.593
Did you have any kind of pre-election information 
about how you were doing? Yeah, I knew when Roger

31:33.895 --> 31:40.986
said he was willing to consider alternatives to 
Bonfire that I was doing pretty well.
