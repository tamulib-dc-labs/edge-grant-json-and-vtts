WEBVTT

00:04.452 --> 00:06.755
Do you happen to remember when Worley sold out? You 
know what? Worley sold out that fellow named Carr

00:11.443 --> 00:17.552
lived in Austin. And Carr sold out. He sold that 
land out there to old man Foster. Old man Foster. He

00:28.568 --> 00:29.850
had a jetty. And that land all belonged to jetty. 
Jetty? Yeah, a fella by the name of Jetty. And Old

00:35.627 --> 00:38.050
Man Foster married his daughter. After Old Man 
Jetty died, you see that Old Man Foster fell out of

00:39.592 --> 00:45.039
that land over there in the mine. And then Old Man 
Foster got in bad shape and moved to town. He sold

00:51.287 --> 00:52.989
the coffee. So coffee owns all that out there now.

00:57.855 --> 01:00.919
One thing I noticed,

01:03.852 --> 01:08.297
to get back to the social activities, they said the 
baseball games were big. Oh, hell, them Nets can

01:08.918 --> 01:10.580
get over there. The company give them a little 
land, they can play it all, and they played

01:11.561 --> 01:15.727
baseball the other Saturday and Sunday. Well, 
were there company baseball teams? Yeah, there

01:18.890 --> 01:21.454
was one company that played the other company. 
See, there's several minds. One company, a

01:23.856 --> 01:29.343
baseball player, would come and play the other 
baseball game. It'd be just like... Did you ever

01:29.363 --> 01:31.866
play baseball with them? Oh, yeah, I played a whole 
lot. I didn't work with shit.

01:38.135 --> 01:39.556
Were Mexicans pretty good ballplayers? They were 
pretty good, yeah. Did their wives and kids come

01:42.020 --> 01:44.402
out and watch? Oh, yeah. When did they usually play 
these baseball games? They still have some games

01:49.469 --> 01:51.531
here now. Last year they had a game they played at 
the fire park up here. But the mining companies got

01:57.979 --> 01:59.862
together? These boys, they don't... They're not 
coal miners anymore, though. They work for these

02:05.424 --> 02:08.227
farmers, you know, and they get together. These 
boys live in town and work on these public jobs.

02:12.091 --> 02:20.881
They'd get together, send dogs somewheres, some 
other town in Michigan to come from other towns to

02:12.091 --> 02:20.881
play them, just like they do with these big ball 
games, you know. They'd come to other places, and

02:20.901 --> 02:23.524
they'd have games.

02:28.069 --> 02:30.411
The best damn players I ever seen was a damned old 
nigger. Oh, really? Yeah. But he wasn't with mine,

02:35.200 --> 02:36.962
so. No.

02:41.006 --> 02:51.436
Well, I cannot put my finger on what date we were 
talking about.

02:51.476 --> 02:52.337
Do you remember that? I wasn't married then. I was 
single. My daddy was one. See, my daddy was a, he had

02:56.160 --> 02:58.943
pneumonia. And Herman Vogel was running the 
engine and my daddy and I was working under him.

03:04.785 --> 03:09.453
They had a big hole in the boiler and they were 
waiting for a boiler repair. And it was on our last

03:11.136 --> 03:13.640
flat to load out. The boiler split right half in 
two. One of them back in went out and the other went

03:17.807 --> 03:22.455
all over the damn country to find bricks. They had 
bricks, you know. We had them bricks all over. You

03:26.089 --> 03:30.313
could find them three or four miles from there, 
where that boiler blowed up and blowed them bricks

03:26.089 --> 03:30.313
up. The damn timber fell on my head over there. They 
had a tween wall between the boiler and the engine.

03:36.559 --> 03:41.965
And me and the engine there was a... It covered us 
up. It hadn't been for that inside wall over here

03:43.867 --> 03:47.330
that killed us. It just caved it over on us. And we 
scrambled out one of them. Rogel didn't get hurt at

03:53.142 --> 03:54.604
all. Two or four fell across my head. They put three 
stitches in it. So you were real lucky. Yeah. Let me

04:01.313 --> 04:02.855
ask you this. One thing I've been confused about is 
that did the coal companies engage in the brick

04:03.336 --> 04:10.866
building business also? No. See, at Rogel, when 
they started there, they had brick yards. And they

04:16.109 --> 04:17.010
made brick. They used the old lignite to burn the 
brick with. They had a brickyard down there. Vogel

04:20.854 --> 04:21.454
did. That's what I thought. Okay. And he used the 
lignite to fuel the... They used the old lignite.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.202
Did you work on that at all? I never did work. Well, 
that's where I started. I started the brickyard

04:31.745 --> 04:33.867
when I was 16 years old. 15, 20 cents an hour. Then 
after the brickyard, they stayed there a long

04:37.170 --> 04:40.013
time. They had niggers work the brickyard. Them 
goddamn niggers like that. They had these little

04:45.995 --> 04:48.978
wheel boys loaded up full of bricks. They'd have 
these running. They'd load them bricks them days

04:50.420 --> 04:52.803
in boxcars. Sometimes they'd load four or five 
boxcars of bricks a day. Shipped them to different

04:57.468 --> 04:59.871
places. I'll go down there and show you where that 
old brickyard used to be. There's all that brick

05:02.695 --> 05:04.817
there. It's down there by the old Bogle mine? 
Mm-hmm. Well, we might do that, you know, if you

05:10.604 --> 05:14.649
feel like it sometimes. You ever see one of them 
bricks? Okay,

05:16.370 --> 05:35.751
could

05:16.370 --> 05:35.751
you go back over how they made the bricks again? You 
said they made some sort of clay? They had these,

05:37.733 --> 05:44.200
they had mules them days and them slips, you know, 
the scraper, you used to call them scrapers. That

05:44.517 --> 05:46.900
was a harness on to the... Yeah. Had mules in those 
days. They didn't have no such thing as trucks or

05:48.683 --> 05:51.828
nothing like that. Yeah. And they had these big 
outfits that they loaded this clay in. They'd dump

05:56.895 --> 05:57.496
it. It had a big old outfit that goes around, goes 
plumb around. And they'd dump that clay in there.

06:03.104 --> 06:07.791
And they had belts to carry this, and they'd dump it 
in the press. And that press would work up and down,

06:09.087 --> 06:11.830
four bricks at a time. Four bricks at a time? Four 
bricks at a time. And there'd be a man out there that

06:14.574 --> 06:18.999
loaded in these wheelbars. They'd be raw bricks, 
but they'd be pressed enough that they wouldn't

06:19.740 --> 06:23.144
come apart. Right. And they'd haul them and put 
them in them burners. In a burner? In them burners,

06:28.050 --> 06:29.411
and then burn the brick. And when they come out, 
that's when they load them in there. I see. And they

06:33.416 --> 06:35.558
used the lignite to fire the burners. They fired 
the burners. There was... They had little old

06:38.922 --> 06:40.504
openings. They had the cast-on outfits in them. 
They had these bow and burners, you know, grates,

06:45.332 --> 06:49.338
late-night grates. They'd put that in and they'd 
say, well, these are about that long. And these

06:53.404 --> 07:00.255
long keels, and they'd get them, that raw brick in 
there, these long keels over there, and there'd be

06:53.404 --> 07:00.255
one About every foot there'd be one of them 
openings where you put the lignite in. On both

07:04.792 --> 07:07.154
sides, on the north side and south side. And you'd 
just shovel it in? Yeah, they'd start to eat it.

07:09.277 --> 07:11.499
You'd smoke them kind of like that about a week. 
Then about two weeks after that, they'd put hot

07:12.540 --> 07:16.225
fire in there. And that's what made them. How long 
did it take to fire them for? Well, it'd take them

07:20.790 --> 07:23.032
four days. It'd take them longer to smoke them. 
They'd smoke them about two or three weeks. And

07:28.658 --> 07:30.040
they'd get them kind of solid. And it'd take about 
eight or ten days before they'd be hard as that. You

07:38.511 --> 07:44.958
were talking earlier that they had a change in the 
type of lighting system they used in the mines.

07:45.278 --> 07:47.901
What was the first type of lighting system they 
used? I guess it'd be back in the 1890s, early

07:49.282 --> 07:51.084
1900s? Yeah, I bet so. I don't know when that coal 
mine started. It was already running, see, when my

07:56.130 --> 07:59.233
daddy came in. What kind of a light system did they 
use for the hand? You said they had a... Well, these

08:02.656 --> 08:08.122
lamps, these lamps is all they used. When they 
first started, they had these, just like I tell

08:08.202 --> 08:11.865
you, little torches. Little torches? Just like a 
lamp. I see. There's a stem stuck out that way, and

08:14.869 --> 08:19.313
they put the oil on top. They put oil on them. They 
put oil in them. That oil is just... You've seen

08:21.536 --> 08:25.159
these torches that you put on the highways, you 
know? That's the way they fixed with a wick in them.

08:27.822 --> 08:28.203
I see. They'd have a wick about... four or five 
inches long, they'd stick it down in there, close

08:30.314 --> 08:38.502
it up, run it out through that spout, and that oil 
would keep, they'd have to light them with

08:30.314 --> 08:38.502
matches. They didn't have none like carbide then. 
It kept a pocket full of matches. And that little

08:43.768 --> 08:48.552
lamp oil would burn you all day long. I see. It was 
kind of dangerous though, wasn't it, when the oil

08:50.174 --> 08:52.416
spilled? Well, all it would do is get your head 
green. But one thing about it, when there was

08:58.225 --> 09:04.572
something wrong in there and wasn't good, them 
lamps wouldn't burn. If you went in one black, in a

09:05.293 --> 09:09.237
black damp or something in there, you better not go 
in there. When that light went out, you better not

09:09.257 --> 09:11.900
go in there. That light will let you know not to go in 
there. And these carbide lamps, they won't go out.

09:18.147 --> 09:23.693
But when there's black damp over there, that blaze 
will be that fur, and when you get in that black

09:18.147 --> 09:23.693
damp, It'll come way out here. That shows you got 
black damp. These carbide lamps show you that,

09:26.828 --> 09:28.630
too. Now, this is black damp? Black damp. D-A-M-P? 
It's where there's no air, you see. You can get in

09:33.837 --> 09:35.559
there and go black damp. Just like sometimes, you 
know, people go in the well, they call it black

09:35.699 --> 09:39.564
damp. I see. You go in there, and if you're in old 
coal mine, you go in there, and if you're getting

09:40.885 --> 09:47.113
black damp, you can smell it. It smells plum sweet. 
I see. Well, you better down here or not go in there.

09:51.415 --> 09:53.297
Did that happen quite a bit in these mines? It was 
once in a while, but they know what it was. And so

09:56.381 --> 09:59.504
they'd get out, and how would they take away the 
black dam? They'd open some more out, take it away,

10:00.005 --> 10:03.589
and put air in. They had these engines on the 
outside, and they had these big propellers, and

10:03.609 --> 10:14.040
that would draw that bad air out of there. I see. 
That'd give you air in the coal mines, too, you see.

10:18.753 --> 10:21.776
They opened a little tunnel and they put this fan 
over there. It was run by steam. It was run

10:23.477 --> 10:24.518
steaming. And they'd have wings on them. You've 
seen these propellers just like these

10:26.400 --> 10:30.744
air-conditioned fans? Well, it was made kind of 
like that. But it was a great big thing. You know, as

10:34.587 --> 10:35.608
big as this house. And they'd go down in these 
diggers' outfits where the air could go in there.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.533
And that's what's funnest to marry down in them 
mines. I see. Did you have any sons or daughters

10:42.834 --> 10:47.038
yourself when you were married? I got one 
daughter. I got one daughter. It's the only

10:50.722 --> 10:51.943
daughter I got. I got a stepdaughter and two 
stepsons. What did your stepsons do? Did they

10:55.848 --> 10:56.689
follow you? My stepson, he was in a car wreck and his 
brain's scattered. He's in the hospital. And my

11:02.878 --> 11:07.464
daughter lives in Houston, my granddaughter. And 
my daughter lives in Bryan. She married a

11:11.028 --> 11:12.030
Bohemian. You have two stepsons? Two step-sons 
and one step-daughter, and then my own daughter.

11:21.307 --> 11:22.469
My wife died in 46. I never did marry no more. My kids 
was all grown when she died. Did your other

11:29.536 --> 11:33.921
step-son become a miner also, or did he do 
something else? No, he never did work at the coal

11:33.941 --> 11:36.824
mine. Would you think, Willie, that coal mines 
would be good for Rockdale? How do you view the coal

11:45.440 --> 11:47.503
mine? I mean, it was your livelihood from most of 
your life. Well, they were good days. Good days?

11:54.131 --> 11:56.113
Everything was cheap. Go up there and you can buy a 
pound of bacon for 15, 20 cents. Coffee, 25 and 30

11:59.818 --> 12:04.984
cents. Everything was cheap.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.246
Well, they had these commissaries. Nearly every 
one of them had a commissary and they sold

12:13.286 --> 12:15.668
groceries. They'd charge your groceries to you 
and then when you got a payday, they'd take it off

12:16.829 --> 12:21.393
you, off your bill. What did the commissaries look 
like? Well, Dr. Sparks had a great big old

12:25.136 --> 12:29.320
commissary when he bought it. But the other places 
just had little commissaries. Well, was Dr.

12:32.022 --> 12:34.444
Sparks' commissary a two-story or? No, it was kind 
of long, long building, about, looks like about

12:34.685 --> 12:41.130
30, 40 feet long, about... 15, 20 feet wide. But he 
kept it well stocked. He could get anything he

12:46.130 --> 12:48.873
couldn't down, all but clothes. And what mine was 
Dr. Storys associated with? The Worley mine?

12:55.662 --> 12:56.443
Worley mine. Worley? That's the first one that 
started there.

13:02.310 --> 13:04.553
Well, did they have counters? in the commissary 
or? Yeah, they had county. You went over there and

13:08.895 --> 13:11.799
you tell them what they want and they'd give you 
what they want. You didn't go back and pick up

13:11.819 --> 13:14.463
things like you do now. I see. They went and got 
everything for you. They went and got everything.

13:18.509 --> 13:20.512
You called for what you want and they'd go get it for 
you. Put it on the county and put it on your bill. I

13:22.695 --> 13:23.056
see. They kept a little leisure. You didn't go help 
yourself then, didn't they? I see. Not like the

13:28.403 --> 13:29.445
safe way. They wouldn't have much left. Time was 
good then, but they'd steal everything you had. I

13:34.993 --> 13:35.113
see. Well, did the Mexican women or the Mexican men 
go to the commissary to shop? No, they had some

13:42.672 --> 13:44.995
Mexican women. They had men who worked for them in 
the commissary. I see. No, no, I never did know of

13:48.921 --> 13:51.865
any women working at the commissary. Well, which 
one of the household? Would it be the wife or the

13:53.988 --> 13:57.632
husband that went and actually bought the food? 
The women go by most of it. See the men be working and

13:59.415 --> 14:03.020
the women go by the grocery. I see. Did you ever own 
any land around in Rockville? No, I didn't own

14:09.139 --> 14:12.583
nothing until I bought this place. I always lived 
on the other man's land. When I lived in town,

14:16.268 --> 14:20.934
that's where my wife died. When I moved to Coal 
Mine, when I moved to town, they sold all them

14:21.194 --> 14:27.382
little huts out there when the mines closed. Them 
farmers would come in there and they bought them.

14:32.409 --> 14:34.952
When did most of the mines close up to your 
recollection? The last mine that was up there was

14:36.586 --> 14:43.917
in 33. Would you say the Depression closed them? 
Yeah, there was no sale for the lignite.

14:55.976 --> 14:58.239
Do you ever just sit back and think about those 
days? Oh yeah, I wish some of it would come back. It

15:02.546 --> 15:04.669
was a good place. Yeah, we'd all get together, 
Bessie and me. We'd all get together and go to them

15:09.059 --> 15:11.881
feasts. Down there, they'd mess and fix some big 
old meals for me and my wife.

15:18.989 --> 15:20.830
What kind of food did they serve you? Oh, man, 
they'd make these style old pepper stuff.

15:23.934 --> 15:25.715
Everything had pepper in it, but we liked it. 
They'd make these cornmeal tortillas and flour

15:26.596 --> 15:31.661
tortillas. Mix it all up. kill a hog or a cow or 
something, got there and put him on, have a big,

15:33.505 --> 15:39.313
they didn't know what barbecue was them days. 
They'd take, you know the way the Minskans

15:40.095 --> 15:58.281
barbecued, then they'd take the meat, they'd dig a 
big hole, wrap it up with thick paper, and put a big

15:40.095 --> 15:58.281
tow sack around it, put the fire in that hole and 
cover it up, and that's the way they barbecued it.

15:58.835 --> 15:59.976
My goodness. That's good. That's going right. 
It's just as good as anything you ever see. It'd be

16:03.459 --> 16:05.061
just as nice and juicy. I've seen them set the old 
cow's head and make a good meal out of them. Gosh.

16:12.207 --> 16:13.168
There's a big old cow. I've seen them. That's 
pretty good eating. You know, that cow's bag is

16:15.069 --> 16:16.691
white meat. You get out there and you eat some of 
that cow's bag. It is good eating. Would you say on

16:24.538 --> 16:27.120
the whole that The Mexicans were not able to save 
money? Well, they never did make enough to save

16:31.180 --> 16:34.946
anything them days. So if they had relatives back 
in Mexico, they really couldn't help them out by

16:35.367 --> 16:39.633
working. Yeah. Every once in a while, they'd take a 
trip. They let them go back and forage them days. It

16:47.304 --> 16:48.766
wasn't restricted or whatnot. They'd go back over 
there. I've had two or three chances when they

16:53.746 --> 16:59.074
asked me if I wanted to go to Mexico with them, but I 
never did go. They said they'd pay my way and

16:59.355 --> 17:02.841
everything and see that I got back. But I never did 
go. Mexico's a nice place. I've been there a couple

17:08.469 --> 17:09.311
times. Yeah. I've had lots of chances to go.

17:15.721 --> 17:17.243
No, they'd send a message over. I'd give them four, 
five, six hundred dollars. He'd go over the coast.

17:23.262 --> 17:27.849
They had to pay so much to get him out of there, you 
know, out of Mexico. Sometimes they'd bring back

17:27.889 --> 17:30.593
25 or 30 Mexicans. So the mine owners would give... 
To bring them to the mine, they didn't call. They

17:35.820 --> 17:38.745
must have really been able to trust that. See, they 
weren't as strict then as they are now. Let me...

17:44.633 --> 17:50.442
Okay, they would take a Mexican worker and give him 
the money, and he would go down to Mexico and bring

17:44.633 --> 17:50.442
back... And get him back. I see. pay their way back, 
because they had to pay their way back.

17:56.208 --> 18:01.716
They'd give them four or five hundred dollars to 
bring them back, pay their way, and it didn't cost

17:56.208 --> 18:01.716
them nothing. The mine owners furnished it. Just 
to get them in here to go to work for them. None of the

18:07.745 --> 18:11.671
mine owners or their representatives went down 
with them. Would you say that the Mexicans were

18:13.413 --> 18:15.396
smuggled in? No, not then Dave. Not that I know of. 
They'd just go over there and go across. I don't

18:23.866 --> 18:26.589
know whether they paid anything enough, see? 
Sometimes they wanted to give the Mexicans four or

18:26.609 --> 18:31.816
five hundred dollars to bring the boys back, pay 
their way. I guess they let them come back then.

18:34.619 --> 18:36.261
They wasn't as strict in them days. See, we got a lot 
of wetbacks over here now. Swimmed across and all

18:41.187 --> 18:42.469
that. Well, what happened to all the Mexican 
mining families? Well, they had some of them went

18:47.956 --> 18:52.243
Dallas, some would go different places on these 
construction jobs. They all left that I know of

18:54.466 --> 19:03.340
there, but two or three of these old Mexicans left 
here, and they owned their little old places down

18:54.466 --> 19:03.340
there. They bought these little old shacks.

19:07.286 --> 19:11.272
Four or five of them lived here in town that worked 
out there. Do you know their names?

19:17.453 --> 19:19.282
I can't think of them right now. Well, if you think 
about it, would you think about
