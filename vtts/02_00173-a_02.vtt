WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:11.711
In the hall, and so I said, sir, in this series, should I put the comma before the and, or should I leave it out?

00:12.873 --> 00:16.617
He said, Mr. Pierce, does it really matter?

00:18.019 --> 00:24.267
And so I had my rule of thumb from then on, not only for punctuation, but for life.

00:25.495 --> 00:26.517
Does it really matter?

00:28.339 --> 00:31.565
And I used to love to hear him answer the phone.

00:31.585 --> 00:36.232
We had the suites of offices and only one phone in the suite.

00:37.173 --> 00:42.802
And when Dr. Summey would be called to the phone, he would say, Dr. Summey Jr.

00:42.842 --> 00:45.446
speaking, or George Summey Jr.

00:45.486 --> 00:46.508
speaking.

00:46.488 --> 00:56.399
And his father was still alive and in his 90s and would come to visit, people said, with a gold-headed cane and be a very prim and proper man.

00:56.439 --> 00:59.082
And Dr. Summey had learned from him.

00:59.823 --> 01:01.425
That's S-U-M-M-E-Y?

01:01.665 --> 01:02.706
S-U-M-M-E-Y.

01:03.987 --> 01:10.875
Other favorite colleagues in those other favorite colleagues in those early years?

01:11.750 --> 01:15.515
I had a number of office mates over the years.

01:15.595 --> 01:22.125
My first office mate was Colonel Kane, a West Point colonel retired.

01:24.548 --> 01:31.378
I had to do my paper grading and reading.

01:32.624 --> 01:43.412
before eight o'clock and after five, because while I was in the office with Colonel Kane, I got very little done.

01:44.033 --> 01:46.760
He was one of the world's great raconteurs.

01:47.783 --> 01:49.688
He had a fund of anecdotes.

01:50.984 --> 01:58.453
A very charming man, very handsome man, very military man.

01:58.693 --> 02:11.389
If you wanted to send somebody over from Central Casting to be a military colonel, that was Colonel Kane.

02:11.943 --> 02:22.825
At the end of the day, he lived at Maggie Parker's, which was the place for entertaining, and she also had rooms where people lived.

02:22.885 --> 02:29.057
Dr. Mayo later lived there after his mother died.

02:32.210 --> 02:34.333
I lost my train of thought there for a minute.

02:34.353 --> 02:36.237
The favorite colleagues.

02:36.257 --> 02:36.918
Favorite colleagues.

02:36.938 --> 02:55.568
Well, Colonel Cain was, without a doubt, one of the closest people I was to while we were rooming, but at five o'clock, he would go home to tend his garden, as he said, and he was staying at Maggie Parker's, and he would go home to drink.

02:57.033 --> 03:01.381
And that was his occupation where he would go to his wife and drink at Maggie Parker's.

03:02.262 --> 03:15.565
Dr. Summey used to like him very much and admire him, as did everybody that I know of.

03:16.793 --> 03:27.748
He had a favorite lecture on the Sacco-Vanzetti case when we talked to one of the plays around the Sacco-Vanzetti case, and other teachers would ask him to come in and lecture.

03:29.247 --> 03:38.696
Then the Eckfelts, Freddie not only taught me all I knew about grammar and punctuation, but he was a very close friend.

03:40.438 --> 03:46.704
And Hayes, Johnny Hayes and Renee Hayes, who was one of the world's great cooks there.

03:47.164 --> 03:58.495
Johnny, you go by to visit him, and he was always in his den working on the definitive book on Mark Twain.

04:00.365 --> 04:06.873
Nobody was ever allowed to see anything that he wrote on Mark Twain.

04:09.417 --> 04:23.875
After he died, two of his colleagues finished up the book on Mark Twain, and I imagine it came out as a vanity publication because I don't think there was much there.

04:25.458 --> 04:30.863
Johnny was one of the most charming men I ever met.

04:31.443 --> 04:32.284
Delightful to know.

04:32.304 --> 04:35.707
I had a wonderful sense of humor, very bright, very handsome man.

04:36.587 --> 04:42.873
And Renee was very darkly attractive and, as I said, a wonderful cook.

04:44.314 --> 04:55.043
As you're getting started as a junior member of the faculty, did anyone, the department head or anyone else, give you any guidelines, any advice, any counsel?

04:56.660 --> 05:01.588
Well, yes, Dr. Mayo said check your mailbox twice a day.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.613
That was guidelines.

05:04.653 --> 05:11.985
And you understood that you should not drink on campus.

05:11.965 --> 05:27.223
We had Vanden Bark, who had written a book on slang that was definitive at the time, was fired because he had this big black Lincoln and he picked up students.

05:27.263 --> 05:29.806
Hitchhiking was the thing to do in those days.

05:29.926 --> 05:39.778
And so he had picked up a student who had a sack in town and they brought him back and stopped at the campus barracks.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.558
and let the student out.

05:42.638 --> 05:49.534
As the student was getting out, he said, would you like a glass of beer or a bottle of beer, Dr. VandenBark?

05:49.554 --> 05:50.636
He said, don't mind if I do.

05:50.696 --> 05:53.262
So the two sat there drinking beer.

05:54.541 --> 06:01.957
And one of the campus security officers came up and stopped him and confiscated the beer.

06:03.160 --> 06:08.692
And Vandenbark gave a wrong name, but everybody recognized this big black Lincoln.

06:08.752 --> 06:10.155
It was like a hearse.

06:10.897 --> 06:14.625
And so he was fired for drinking on campus.

06:14.605 --> 06:18.270
What about dress?

06:18.430 --> 06:20.714
What were the obvious guidelines?

06:20.994 --> 06:27.403
Well, the obvious guidelines were you wore a coat, usually a suit, and a tie.

06:28.765 --> 06:31.869
And that got to be my uniform for years.

06:31.949 --> 06:36.175
I felt undressed if I didn't have a coat and a tie on.

06:36.155 --> 06:38.798
And you were to be on campus how long?

06:39.359 --> 06:47.909
Well, you were normally supposed to be there during the eight-hour day, although some people didn't follow that rule.

06:47.929 --> 06:52.675
They never really checked up on you that I know of, but some of your colleagues did.

06:53.977 --> 07:01.406
We had one colleague who would go and report if somebody was not in his office or hadn't been around, but.

07:02.146 --> 07:03.428
Were there many smokers?

07:04.268 --> 07:07.092
Oh, it was, yeah, there was quite a few people who smoked.

07:07.292 --> 07:08.794
Did they smoke in their office?

07:08.814 --> 07:10.397
Oh, yes.

07:10.417 --> 07:17.406
And how long did it take for you to get an office over on the, in the academic building with the rest of the family?

07:17.426 --> 07:26.859
Well, it, it, we finally, it didn't take long, very long, before I actually had a office on the first floor of the academic building.

07:26.879 --> 07:31.626
They gave us, gave us a group of suites down there.

07:32.095 --> 07:42.249
Now, the department head when you arrived was— Dr. Thomas F. Mayo, who had been—who had two claims to fame.

07:42.470 --> 07:49.740
One, he had taught Faulkner in high school in Oxford, Mississippi.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.182
Did he ever mention that?

07:51.443 --> 07:53.125
Oh, yes.

07:53.695 --> 07:57.300
He was a Rhodes Scholar.

07:57.820 --> 07:59.142
Dr. Mayo was a Rhodes Scholar.

08:00.664 --> 08:09.316
He came to A&M on joint appointment as head librarian and a professor of English.

08:11.018 --> 08:17.847
Then when Gib Gilchrist, who was then the dean of engineering, brought in the engineer's library,

08:18.367 --> 08:32.907
There was a power struggle between Mayo and Dean Gilchrist as to who was over the engineer's library.

08:34.249 --> 08:39.096
And so then Gib Gilchrist was made president.

08:39.116 --> 08:45.505
And one of the first things he did, Dr. Summey having come to the point of retirement,

08:47.189 --> 09:02.263
was to make Dr. Mayo full-time head of the English department and hire a new librarian so that there was no question of who was in charge of the engineer's library.

09:03.004 --> 09:04.686
Now that had all occurred before you got back.

09:04.706 --> 09:15.576
That had all occurred before I came here, and Louie Hauer used to joke saying that Dr. Summey ought to pay

09:16.957 --> 09:29.788
All of these people, for all of the coffee they had bought him, different people like Dr. Koffer, and that was an honorary title.

09:31.329 --> 09:36.774
Everybody was a doctor, whether you had the terminal degree or not.

09:36.914 --> 09:39.776
Everybody, you were just automatically doctor.

09:39.896 --> 09:46.862
To this day, I'm called doctor and have it done by people, and I've finally given up on correcting them.

09:48.563 --> 09:51.447
Describe Dr. Mayo as a person.

09:52.929 --> 09:56.334
Well, he was a delightful man.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.078
He was extremely well read.

10:00.780 --> 10:16.743
And my first memory of him other than meeting him and telling me this corner of the desk is yours, as he was walking down the hall in the academic building and he seemed to be in a hurry, I said, Dr. Mayo, where are you going?

10:16.803 --> 10:18.165
He said, I'm off to

10:18.955 --> 10:26.524
teach this gun for hire to the ladies of the social club."

10:27.345 --> 10:33.173
He said, it's Graham Greene's wonderful mystery story, this gun for hire.

10:33.193 --> 10:40.882
I thought that was an amazing thing for a man who was noted for literature and all to teach.

10:42.724 --> 10:48.912
And he never saw a movie that he didn't like no matter how bad it was.

10:50.815 --> 11:07.433
The manager of the theater, local movie theater, had a chance to bring the Texas first showing of Orson Welles Macbeth to A&M.

11:09.034 --> 11:14.460
And so he invited the English department to see a preview of it.

11:16.111 --> 11:24.045
because it had mixed reviews, and he wanted to know whether he wanted to have the premiere performance or not.

11:25.527 --> 11:34.322
So we all went and saw Orson Welles' Macbeth, and most of us thought it was horrible.

11:36.580 --> 12:00.040
and so when we went out the manager was buttonholing some of us and he had Dr. Mayo and Johnny Hayes and myself talking and Johnny and I were saying what a bad movie it was and Dr. Mayo was saying how wonderful it was and just then Dr. Summey came slowly walking up

12:01.336 --> 12:07.765
the aisle and the manager said, Dr. Summey, Dr. Summey, how did you like it?

12:07.845 --> 12:11.490
Dr. Summey never broke step, but he passed by.

12:11.570 --> 12:16.537
He said, I don't know what it was, but it wasn't Shakespeare.

12:16.557 --> 12:22.586
Dr. Mayo kept on talking and talking about it.

12:22.926 --> 12:26.331
I knew that the argument was settled right then and there.

12:26.311 --> 12:36.021
The moment Dr. Summey said, I don't know what it was, but it wasn't Shakespeare, that settled it for the manager, and so we did not have the premiere of Macbeth.

12:36.922 --> 12:40.425
Describe Dr. Mayo physically.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.367
What did he—big?

12:42.948 --> 12:55.761
No, he was—I would say about a 5'10", very kindly expression, very kind man, very— Well-dressed?

12:57.563 --> 13:21.529
He was usually in a sort of tan suit or a brown suit, and he lived with his mother, and she and the maid, black maid, both ruled him, and he was definitely under their thumb.

13:21.509 --> 13:37.359
But then after his mother died, he pensioned off the black woman, and he went to live at Miss Maggie's, which was the big—I forget what they call it—the Knoll or something like that, the Oaks in town, in Bryan.

13:38.601 --> 13:40.024
And he always gave—

13:40.004 --> 13:43.532
He was always entertained and played a lot of bridge.

13:45.898 --> 13:58.367
Once a year, he repaid all of the invitations he'd had over the year by giving a wonderful dinner, sort of buffet-style dinner party at Maggie Parker's, where he lived.

13:58.347 --> 14:16.391
One of my favorite stories about today, he looked out the window and saw this wonderful party on the lawn that she catered, Miss Maggie catered, and Rosa, the Mexican woman who worked for her, passed by his room and the door was open.

14:16.411 --> 14:18.915
He said, Rosa, whose party is that?

14:19.475 --> 14:21.178
She says, It's yours, Dr. Mayo.

14:22.299 --> 14:25.283
And he'd forgotten all that.

14:26.275 --> 14:37.172
Because in the interview with Sterling Evans, I asked him what led him to be so supportive of the A&M Library and so generous.

14:38.474 --> 14:46.587
And quickly he said, because under Tommy Mayo, the A&M Library was such a pleasant place for a shy country boy.

14:47.489 --> 14:49.392
And see, he was here in the teens.

14:49.412 --> 14:49.672
Yeah.

14:50.233 --> 14:53.498
But Dr. Mayo already

14:53.883 --> 14:55.545
Was he a congenial colleague?

14:55.785 --> 14:56.927
Oh, very congenial.

14:56.947 --> 14:59.230
One of the most congenial people I ever knew.

15:00.151 --> 15:04.877
I once accused him of being a dog hater.

15:06.259 --> 15:06.760
He said, no.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.121
I said, I don't hate dogs.

15:08.262 --> 15:09.723
He said, I hate dog lovers.

15:10.544 --> 15:13.488
All right.

15:13.669 --> 15:21.038
What were some of the things you learned about teaching those first years?

15:23.498 --> 15:26.963
Well, as I said, I learned a great deal from Fred Eckfeldt.

15:28.625 --> 15:36.816
He was a man that if I had a question, I'd say, here's a question about punctuation.

15:36.876 --> 15:45.548
Well, he would take down any book at random, open it to any page at random, run his finger down it until he found an example of it.

15:46.490 --> 15:47.451
Then he would show it to me.

15:47.631 --> 15:52.678
He would explain it, my question, and then he would ask me to repeat it.

15:54.937 --> 15:56.059
And my own words.

15:56.760 --> 16:03.469
And once he was satisfied that I, if he wasn't satisfied with my answer, he would go over it again with me in a different way.

16:03.610 --> 16:05.532
And that's how I learned.

16:05.853 --> 16:10.079
And other than that, I was self-taught.

16:11.641 --> 16:16.388
And describe a typical, your routine of a typical class day.

16:16.428 --> 16:18.852
What time did you get to the campus and what did you do when?

16:19.753 --> 16:23.779
Well, I usually got to the campus at the start by,

16:25.244 --> 16:50.357
I was living on the campus of course and it was just in a sense about half a block from the YMCA to the academic building and so I would have breakfast at Cebiza or Aggieland Inn or one of the drugstores or there was under the YMCA

16:52.447 --> 16:55.535
I may have said I lived at the Aggieland Inn.

16:55.555 --> 16:56.317
That's wrong.

16:56.337 --> 16:56.878
YMCA.

16:56.979 --> 17:05.781
Under the YMCA was a coffee shop and a billiard parlor and also a barber shop.

17:05.963 --> 17:08.446
Were there any chairs in that little coffee shop?

17:08.466 --> 17:08.787
Oh, yeah.

17:09.347 --> 17:10.589
Chairs in there with stools.

17:10.709 --> 17:11.150
Casey's?

17:11.610 --> 17:12.011
Casey's.

17:12.051 --> 17:12.832
That was Casey's.

17:13.853 --> 17:18.620
And so I often ate it there early in the morning, just grab a bite, go over to the office.

17:18.640 --> 17:25.609
And I usually got there between 7.15 to 7.30.

17:27.361 --> 17:34.151
I usually had eight o'clock across the board, being early morning people.

17:34.251 --> 17:44.827
And even after I got to be director of scheduling, I scheduled my classes eight o'clock across the board and gave myself all morning classes.

17:44.907 --> 17:51.917
I had been assigned one one o'clock class, and it was

17:51.965 --> 18:00.296
the logic class, my first teaching of it, and half the students fell asleep and I was ready to join them.

18:00.376 --> 18:12.532
By the time the semester was over, one student, a Filipino, came to me and told me, Mr. Pierce, what a wonderful class it was and how much he had enjoyed it.

18:13.553 --> 18:15.255
I said, you are the only one.

18:17.328 --> 18:19.932
You are the only one, because I couldn't say as much.

18:20.513 --> 18:25.541
But I never had an afternoon class after that, if I could help it.

18:25.561 --> 18:29.947
Now, these classes were 25, 30 students each?

18:30.568 --> 18:36.998
Yes, except for later on in speech, we got 20 with that.

18:37.158 --> 18:42.206
And in technical writing, we got, I think, 20.

18:43.688 --> 18:46.052
In the afternoons, what did you do in the afternoon?

18:47.213 --> 18:52.501
Well, normally I either read the papers.

18:52.761 --> 18:56.367
When I wasn't around Colonel Cain, if he was off in class, I'd read the papers.

18:57.168 --> 19:00.433
I studied, read, went to the library.

19:01.996 --> 19:05.862
I did a lot of writing of my own, creative writing.

19:07.524 --> 19:14.655
At one time, Fred Eckfeldt and I had about 90 percent of the publications

19:15.580 --> 19:23.412
Not Fred Eckfeld, but I mean Harry Kidd and I had about 90 percent of the publications in the department.

19:23.792 --> 19:33.267
And when I applied for a grant for summer one time, one of the vice presidents of the college turned me down.

19:33.327 --> 19:38.074
He said, this man's publications are just stories.

19:38.094 --> 19:43.883
And I thought, my God, as an English teacher, it's all right to teach stories, but it's not all right to write them.

19:44.943 --> 19:52.356
And Harry got very little respect from his colleagues, too, because we wrote.

19:54.721 --> 20:02.795
One of my colleagues and a very dear friend said, but Frank, you get paid for these stories.

20:02.815 --> 20:09.347
And I thought that was the highest compliment you could get is somebody was willing to give you money for them.

20:09.327 --> 20:12.131
In general, where were they being published?

20:12.331 --> 20:13.473
What publications?

20:13.493 --> 20:30.036
Well, at one time, my first publication was with Playboy, and I had discovered a mimeographed legal opinion

20:30.961 --> 20:49.240
that had been given by an attorney general of the state of Texas when a farmer's bull had leapt the fence and mated with some of the cows that were in an extension service

20:49.220 --> 20:55.031
experiment and loused up a breeding program and all.

20:55.051 --> 21:02.625
And so in their anger, the people at the Extension Service had castrated the bull and the bull had died.

21:02.665 --> 21:09.979
And the farmer had demanded repayment and they had paid him twenty dollars out of local funds.

21:10.904 --> 21:14.991
And then they tried to get the state to reimburse them for the local funds.

21:15.873 --> 21:32.322
And this attorney general had written the opinion that, you know, a very witty and amusing opinion about this proletarian bull wanting to beat the

21:32.302 --> 21:38.133
bells of high society and so on, and they carried on at great length and denying the payment.

21:38.173 --> 21:54.445
And so I had taken this and, like most jokes, he'd carried it too far, and I'd cut it and toned down some of the language and submitted it to

21:55.235 --> 21:56.796
Playboy, and they bought it.

21:57.337 --> 22:04.724
And they changed the title to what I thought was the most wonderful title in the world, about this castrated bull.

22:04.884 --> 22:06.906
They called it How Now, Brown Cow.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.272
And I was also writing for the men's magazines and mystery.

22:14.433 --> 22:21.360
Most of my stories have been in the mystery field, but when I started teaching creative writing,

22:21.340 --> 22:28.446
I tried to write every kind of thing, and so I published and all sorts of things.

22:28.526 --> 22:44.440
I had many pedagogical articles in English in Texas, had some scholarly articles in SMLA journals and in College English Association, like that.

22:45.161 --> 22:48.904
And you composed these on the typewriter or in longhand?

22:49.665 --> 22:50.706
Both, both.

22:52.745 --> 23:08.020
I tried to teach my students the fact that if you write something in longhand, it's not as easy to read as it is when it's typed.

23:09.147 --> 23:23.573
And I said, many times, if you write something on a typewriter, the teacher or the reader will miss mistakes because he's reading it more rapidly, whereas he's reading more slowly because you're handwriting.

23:23.653 --> 23:23.953
Why?

23:24.554 --> 23:27.139
The mistakes leap out from the page at the teacher.

23:27.473 --> 23:30.137
So I said, type when you can for your own sake.

23:30.637 --> 23:46.460
And then it always seemed to me that there was a different story when you wrote it in longhand and then typed it and then saw it on the printed page because it ended up being three different stories in effect by the rate of reading that you had.

23:47.261 --> 23:50.325
And I always said if you write a story

23:51.065 --> 23:54.028
and you have a hundred readers, there are 101 stories.

23:54.869 --> 24:10.486
There's a story that you wrote and a hundred different stories that your readers write because each reader brings something of himself and past experience and interests, prejudices to the story.

24:10.506 --> 24:16.532
Back to your normal routine schedule, so you're working all afternoon, you would

24:16.512 --> 24:18.314
quit about 5 o'clock, 5 o'clock?

24:18.414 --> 24:20.938
Usually about 5, sometimes later.

24:21.318 --> 24:24.262
And then eat, and what about what in the evenings?

24:24.322 --> 24:25.804
What did you do before you got married?

24:26.685 --> 24:29.209
Well, sometimes I went to movies.

24:30.430 --> 24:37.980
I went to performances at Guyon Hall, which was a very handsome building that I

24:37.960 --> 24:39.443
Hated to see Torn Down.

24:39.503 --> 24:44.733
Do you remember some, that guy and do you remember some famous performers?

24:45.615 --> 24:52.308
Well, they had, I remember Andrew, I think Andrew Previn, Andrew Previn came one time.

24:52.929 --> 24:55.935
We had a symphony orchestra and

24:58.598 --> 25:11.575
But I don't, other than symphonies and their plays and things like that, I try to pre-opage, you know, types of performance that I don't really recall offhand any of them.

25:11.895 --> 25:18.143
Where did you and your buddies, if you were going to relax on a Friday night or a Saturday night, where did you go?

25:21.582 --> 25:31.322
Well, we usually went out to a restaurant for a meal and maybe to a show.

25:31.505 --> 25:40.121
Even after I married one of the big things was on Saturday night we'd drive down to Bryan Main Street and park and watch people go by.

25:41.243 --> 25:42.866
That's not much activity though.

25:42.886 --> 25:51.142
There wasn't all that much activity unless you went to some kind of performance on campus or you listened a lot to radio.

25:51.743 --> 25:54.829
What was the most upscale place to eat then?

25:56.648 --> 25:58.270
There wasn't any.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.651
Upscale place.

26:02.094 --> 26:09.663
I think Miss Maggie's dinners, Maggie Parker's dinners, was about as upscale as you could get when you went to the Oaks.

26:09.683 --> 26:10.544
Now that's the boarding house in Bryan.

26:10.564 --> 26:13.728
That was the boarding house called, I think at the Oaks it was called.

26:15.410 --> 26:17.432
And then there were Hotarge was well known.

26:17.492 --> 26:18.994
It was a cafeteria.

26:18.974 --> 26:27.964
And I think one of the buildings out at the school is named Hotards, one of the dormitories.

26:29.125 --> 26:30.466
And he had four sons now.

26:32.148 --> 26:41.338
But that was the place to eat and you would go downtown and eat and you'd go to a show and there really wasn't much to do unless you played bridge or something like that.

26:41.418 --> 26:42.940
There was an awful lot of bridge playing.

26:44.270 --> 27:07.920
Now one time Fred Benson told me that one of the unwritten rules that he and his friends followed was that if they were playing any games of chance for money that they closed the blinds and that they never, ever, ever served any alcohol if a student was present.

27:07.940 --> 27:09.602
Did you ever hear anything like that?

27:09.734 --> 27:18.544
Well, you didn't drink with your students and you, of course, weren't to be caught sexually with your students, but that happened, too, any number of times.

27:24.370 --> 27:33.801
Going to the movie theater at Guyon and at the campus theater, the Aggie students would make a lot of noise, wouldn't they, sometimes?

27:34.810 --> 27:38.934
Well, there was always, even downtown theaters, anywhere you went.

27:38.954 --> 27:39.875
Oh, did they downtown too?

27:40.556 --> 27:40.776
Yeah.

27:40.796 --> 27:45.420
There was always a certain amount of noise, but I didn't think it was bad.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.903
It didn't bother me anyhow.

27:47.923 --> 27:55.911
In those first year or two of your teaching, did Dr. Mayo give you any evaluation?

27:56.431 --> 27:59.254
Did he call you in and tell you how you were doing and how to?

27:59.995 --> 28:00.295
No.

28:01.540 --> 28:08.771
When I first came here, you taught your classes.

28:11.014 --> 28:16.262
You checked your mailbox.

28:16.282 --> 28:22.591
And you did not fraternize outside of the school with your students.

28:22.631 --> 28:29.421
And you did not drink on campus, but those are about the

28:30.785 --> 28:32.669
Only things that I ever recall.

28:33.471 --> 28:45.638
Finally we got into evaluations and some of the written, you had this scale one time I remember from one to ten.

28:46.293 --> 28:48.558
One being low and ten being high.

28:48.598 --> 28:56.998
I remember this one class in creative writing where somebody went down the margin and marked me more than ten.

28:57.058 --> 29:05.297
And another student in the same class went down the margin and marked me less than one.

29:05.277 --> 29:28.548
So it was mainly how you struck the students and they were allowed to write comments and the comments were so violent in some cases that the secretary finally refused to type up the comments and so the dean ended typing and the liberal arts ended up typing the comments.

29:29.128 --> 29:30.891
Now who was the dean in those first years?

29:31.592 --> 29:34.255
Well Dean Brooks was the first one I remember.

29:35.602 --> 29:37.004
And he was a very state man.

29:37.084 --> 29:43.754
I remember when, I guess, Bolton was vice president.

29:43.774 --> 29:53.408
And Bolton gave a talk and said, if you didn't get a raise, ask yourself if you merited a raise.

29:54.485 --> 30:06.043
The whole thing was very snide and I objected to it, so I wrote a letter to Dean Brooks objecting to Bolton's remarks and the way he had put them.

30:07.825 --> 30:17.961
I got a note back from Dean Brooks, in effect, saying this letter is going to be kept in your file and held against you, and the next year Bolton was president.

30:21.063 --> 30:24.428
I made my mark at A&M very early on.

30:24.488 --> 30:25.129
I got known.

30:26.230 --> 30:35.243
I attended my first liberal arts faculty meeting and I was not dressed as appropriately.

30:35.323 --> 30:44.556
I was more in a sporty outfit and everybody else was more stained because I didn't have too many different clothes right at the start.

30:46.088 --> 30:50.794
And so I wore a lot of sports clothes, even though they were a little bit frowned on.

30:51.095 --> 30:52.597
Nobody ever said anything.

30:52.617 --> 31:04.172
And at this meeting, they gave the Summey report on the Benny report.

31:05.994 --> 31:10.700
And I forget what it was all about, but this motion that we do something.

31:10.941 --> 31:14.205
And obviously, nobody wanted to do it.
