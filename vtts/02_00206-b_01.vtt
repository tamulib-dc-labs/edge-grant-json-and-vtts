WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:11.239
I want to divide up this 30,000 into three 
instructor assistant professors and see what I

00:03.389 --> 00:11.239
can find. I said we're beginning to be enough 
students in political science 206 and 7 which are

00:11.940 --> 00:32.147
the state required political science courses 
that we can and we've got some things to fill. Well,

00:33.308 --> 00:37.614
so that was my first kind of policy decision. He 
said, fine, break it up. And I brought in a couple of

00:39.897 --> 00:45.445
instructors and an assistant professor. And

00:46.546 --> 00:52.515
then I took a look at the curriculum. Well, it had 
been designed from my predecessor asking the

00:53.015 --> 01:02.168
faculty, what would you like to teach? Well, then 
we got a strange array. For example, we had ancient

01:07.512 --> 01:13.558
political theory and no other.

01:14.319 --> 01:20.945
There was not adequate work in politics, 
political parties, and so on. So, we were pretty

01:23.307 --> 01:32.897
well off in comparative government, but nothing 
Latin American, and we're next to Mexico. It seems

01:33.535 --> 01:38.422
to me perfectly obvious that there ought to be 
something that direction. And

01:39.343 --> 01:51.501
so we undertake a full-scale curriculum 
revision.

01:54.606 --> 01:56.809
Was anybody key to that? Nobody special. We as a 
faculty wanted committees and began to work it

01:58.579 --> 02:03.083
over. Did they work together pretty well on that? 
Yeah. The third thing that I'd done almost

02:06.946 --> 02:27.083
immediately I sensed that my predecessor had been 
nasty Tibetan and he's what I call a

02:06.946 --> 02:27.083
bleeding-heart bureaucratic liberal. I don't 
know whether you're familiar with the title, talk

02:29.105 --> 02:44.328
a wonderful

02:29.105 --> 02:44.328
human relations game and are arbitrary as hell 
when it comes to their own decisions. So I told the

02:45.510 --> 02:57.188
faculty I'd like to do a deliberative faculty and I 
want to make it clear that If we're discussing

02:57.421 --> 03:03.328
something, I want to hear all sides, and I don't 
care whether you differ with me or whether you

02:57.421 --> 03:03.328
don't. I said, if we finally make a decision, I 
expect us all to do it. But up to that point, I want

03:08.914 --> 03:20.428
everybody to feel free without fear and favor to 
express themselves. Well, it took about six

03:20.548 --> 03:26.635
months before people began talk and feel that 
maybe Van Riper meant what he said.

03:34.138 --> 03:36.941
Now, during this period, you all were quartered 
physically where? In the second story of the YMCA.

03:42.689 --> 03:49.077
We had that floor, which had a couple of classrooms 
in it, enough offices. My office is the one that was

03:49.137 --> 03:52.701
the personnel office for some time. This man 
Benton, describe Gene Blue Book Benton. Well,

03:57.530 --> 04:13.651
Gene was interesting

03:57.530 --> 04:13.651
in that he was the only one in the faculty that had 
any kind of reputation outside the university.

04:13.671 --> 04:18.617
He'd done an excellent book on Nuremberg trials. 
Gene was one of the worst lecturers possible.

04:24.614 --> 04:26.356
But it was funny. After a year or two, I would get 
letters back from people praising his legal

04:26.376 --> 04:32.584
training. He did public law. Because he said, Gene 
taught me to write a brief. And as I say, as a

04:41.716 --> 04:45.701
lecture, he'd put you to sleep. But I had the same 
problem at Cornell with Harold Gosnell, who was

04:45.901 --> 04:52.630
distinguished in the The first man to do a 
political science book based on

04:53.960 --> 05:03.093
punch card voting. This is 1930. Eight

05:05.817 --> 05:11.145
or nine or so. Progressive politics in Iowa. And 
uses factor analysis and he does the whole goddamn

05:13.989 --> 05:22.161
thing by hand.

05:22.428 --> 05:32.225
He was so far ahead of the game, but most of us, when 
he lectured, there are nuggets through this

05:22.428 --> 05:32.225
thing, but we figured half the time we wondered if 
he was drunk. Did you ever, those of us who knew

05:32.866 --> 05:43.004
Benton heard him identified by the students as 
Blue Book Benton, were there any anecdotes that

05:32.866 --> 05:43.004
came to the department head? No, not so much on that 
score.

05:48.297 --> 05:53.664
Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I always heard him 
described as boobs-bent. There's certain other

05:54.765 --> 05:57.149
attributes in the family.

06:00.974 --> 06:03.136
But he and I always got along fine. Now, he taught 
big sections in state government also. He taught

06:07.342 --> 06:10.186
state and local government because he had a 
textbook in him. And he was my saving when it came to

06:11.708 --> 06:15.773
schedules. I always had to have some 8 o'clock 
courses, and Benedict wanted five right across

06:16.428 --> 06:21.715
the board. Five 8 o'clocks was fine. So I just laid 
those out, and that took care of my 8 o'clock. Now,

06:30.306 --> 06:39.277
Jack Woods was nicknamed Jock Woods because 
supposedly athletes would pass his course

06:30.306 --> 06:39.277
always. But Jack, I also got complaints about Jack 
Because he taught, again, law work in

06:46.955 --> 07:01.552
administrative law and also, oh, I forget another 
course. And Jack taught by the Socratic method,

07:01.572 --> 07:08.861
which God knows is peculiar enough 
undergraduate. And some people would come in and

07:09.241 --> 07:13.907
say, I can't take it. And I would let them out and not 
argue about it. But more people, again, would

07:17.988 --> 07:25.326
write back, Jack taught me how the law worked.

07:27.311 --> 07:28.092
So it was funny. I had a lot of complaints on those 
two people, but the most compliment. And Kwong Roe

07:33.563 --> 07:37.008
was already here? Kwong Roe was here. He was an 
associate professor with Denny. What was his

07:40.533 --> 07:41.595
specialty? His Far Eastern studies. I

07:47.784 --> 08:02.625
kept trying to encourage Roe to do more 
publication because, and he finally did some. But

08:03.196 --> 08:07.824
Kwong performed well as far as I was concerned.

08:11.310 --> 08:13.513
Was there a master's degree when you got here? Yes, 
they had just an ordinary MA. About what was the

08:16.499 --> 08:22.028
enrollment in number of undergraduate majors and 
graduate majors? Well, I'm trying to think of the

08:22.048 --> 08:24.071
figures then. We had, I suppose, several hundred 
undergraduate majors. Now it's two or three times

08:31.141 --> 08:34.706
that.

08:36.228 --> 08:38.131
And of course we had enormous enrollments. We had 
everybody in the university practically because

08:38.171 --> 08:51.069
Blinn College isn't here then much in American 
government and state and local government. What

08:53.012 --> 08:57.418
about at the graduate level?

08:58.495 --> 09:01.179
or five or six PhD candidates. You mentioned, what 
about at the Masters? How many Masters? At the

09:04.284 --> 09:13.279
Masters, about, oh, it varied between, for two or 
three years, between five and ten. Now,

09:13.299 --> 09:14.401
basically... Tended to be more teachers who 
were... Could you generalize about the political

09:14.822 --> 09:23.676
science undergraduate majors, what their career 
goals were? Well, it was very clear that we had a lot

09:24.398 --> 09:29.625
of pre-law, and we had a lot of core.

09:33.049 --> 09:38.275
I was here one year, and the next year we were to have 
a self-study for crediting purposes. And a

09:38.476 --> 09:44.944
professor from South Carolina came in and said, 
why are you teaching so much comparative

09:38.476 --> 09:44.944
government? I said, we've got the

09:45.084 --> 09:50.811
core students are interested in it. They're going 
to be all over the world. I said, so we're a little

09:53.654 --> 10:04.168
disproportionate yet in terms of international

09:53.654 --> 10:04.168
affairs, comparative government. Benton taught 
international relations as well as

10:18.702 --> 10:22.247
So as I say, we wanted junior faculty. We redid the 
curriculum. I wanted a mixture of

10:25.151 --> 10:35.386
traditional and behavioral. So to do justice to 
the behavioral, I set up the first departmental

10:35.626 --> 10:47.443
laboratory when we moved to Bolton Hall. It had 
been the electrical engineering building, and it

10:48.233 --> 10:53.740
had all the connections. So working with the head 
of sociology, we did a two-way mirror, and we

10:54.862 --> 11:02.572
didn't have computers then. We had a bank of 
calculators. And we set up a 208

11:05.716 --> 11:16.570
and 9 as methodological courses. I had gone 
through Chicago without a methodological

11:17.663 --> 11:24.070
course.

11:24.090 --> 11:26.672
Nobody taught political science methodology. 
I'd had some from White in the historical method.

11:31.137 --> 11:44.751
I'd had Gosnell's work in political parties, but 
it was his quantitative work that was novel, but he

11:31.137 --> 11:44.751
didn't teach it as such. I took a course in 
statistics and

11:45.406 --> 11:56.562
psychology.

11:58.885 --> 12:04.073
And I took a course in accounting in the business 
school at Chicago. So I had more than was customary

12:04.934 --> 12:09.220
in my generation. It looked like this was coming, 
so I began. And we've carried on ever since with the

12:13.345 --> 12:16.989
laboratory. And so

12:18.691 --> 12:27.841
those are the main kind of thrusts at the 
beginning. Then Maxwell asked for a five-year

12:27.961 --> 12:30.884
plan. And I indicated something, building from 
the bottom. We'd done the curriculum. We had the

12:38.092 --> 12:39.173
laboratory. I said, I would like to get an MPA and a 
PhD in due course. I thought we ought to do the MPA

12:50.228 --> 12:57.175
first

12:50.228 --> 12:57.175
and then a PhD. Did he seem fully supportive of 
these? Oh, yes. Yeah. He just wanted us to have a

13:02.420 --> 13:03.881
plan. He wasn't trying to tell us what it ought to 
be.

13:12.076 --> 13:29.798
And so he

13:12.076 --> 13:29.798
also fully, he was one of the few deans who fully 
understood all, he was an economist, he

13:12.076 --> 13:29.798
understood the whole damn budgetary process. In 
fact, he was working with the coordinating board

13:30.368 --> 13:40.983
in the legislature to get the per credit hour stuff 
modified to a certain amount of reality.

13:48.774 --> 13:58.047
So

13:48.774 --> 13:58.047
then I developed a, to get us some additional 
income, We could do an exemption exam for Poli Sci

13:59.579 --> 14:04.746
206. So I had done one at Cornell. So I designed my 
own. And we gave the exemption exam. And we got the

14:12.075 --> 14:21.667
$15 per student who took it or passed it or not and 
added to our departmental funds to some extent.

14:21.687 --> 14:28.776
And I needed maybe one less professor to teach a 
section. Let's see, beyond that... Describe the

14:32.712 --> 14:35.796
process of getting those two new degrees. Oh, 
the... What was the red tape? What were the

14:39.761 --> 14:41.664
hearings? Well, the MPA was first. I worked with 
the dean of business, John... Pearson. Pearson.

14:49.214 --> 14:50.856
On that, who had some interest. He had a state and 
local finance man. He had Arthur Wolfe, who was

14:54.961 --> 14:59.387
Ph.D. Chicago in personnel. And so he had some 
things that would fit into a public program. And he

15:05.171 --> 15:08.074
was supportive, thank heaven. And so he and I 
designed one. And unfortunately, the

15:11.457 --> 15:25.449
coordinating board, which had been passing 
everything, this is what led Gibb, my

15:11.457 --> 15:25.449
predecessor, to make a mistake on his PhD. 
Coordinating board had been proving anything A&M

15:25.469 --> 15:30.133
asked. Just as we got through the university 
faculty, our MPA proposal, courting board put a

15:30.451 --> 15:41.625
two-year moratorium on all new degrees. So I'm... 
That doesn't do us any good for a Ph.D. either. So

15:49.155 --> 15:59.007
I've been seven years a department head, and I 
decide that's enough, and we...

16:01.096 --> 16:07.483
ride out the two years, and the MPA is then 
approved. So that would have been about what year?

16:11.208 --> 16:12.029
79.

16:14.231 --> 16:18.376
And we have a, it's going very nicely.

16:23.061 --> 16:30.850
Heavily an evening effort, as it needs to be, 
although we had some courses in the regular time.

16:31.741 --> 16:42.934
We must have had, after a year or two, we have 30

16:31.741 --> 16:42.934
to 50 in residence at any one time. So it began about 
the decade of 1980? 79, essentially. Okay, 79. And

16:51.204 --> 16:56.010
I'm the, I function as the director of it. So you've 
done that now for? I've done that for two years, and

16:59.055 --> 17:01.578
then retired.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.967
Your history man became dean.

17:12.393 --> 17:13.975
Oh, what's his name? Following, he, who hated 
Nance. Wait, wait, dean or president? Dean, dean

17:20.904 --> 17:23.668
of liberal arts. After Maxwell?

17:29.661 --> 17:30.802
My mind is going blank. Well, he was history all 
right. Where'd he? He'd been in the department,

17:34.887 --> 17:41.516
and I can't think of his name. When we had all the 
former deans here, he came to dinner a while back.

17:49.805 --> 17:52.008
Oh, I know perfectly well. Well, we'll think of 
them in a minute. Let's see.

17:59.096 --> 18:07.045
Describe John C. Calhoun as vice president and 
Jack Kenny Williams as president during those

17:59.096 --> 18:07.045
years. Well, the one I liked most was the generals. 
He was president my first year. Yes. Describe

18:17.144 --> 18:18.365
working with him. He didn't have much to work with. 
He let us do what we wanted to do, but he's the only

18:20.809 --> 18:27.077
president who ever had the department head each 
one of them in for a visit. Describe that visit. It

18:30.401 --> 18:31.162
was very pleasant. Asked me what I was interested 
in, where I came from, any special problems, and

18:31.242 --> 18:37.490
the rest of it. Very calm and relaxed. Did he seem 
like a good listener? Yes, very much so. Oh, yeah. I

18:43.737 --> 18:48.524
had him into our pub ad program to lecture three or 
four times after that. Describe him as a

18:49.145 --> 18:52.631
personality. What was his style? The calmest, 
most relaxed general I ever saw. Did he seem well

19:01.124 --> 19:02.486
organized? Oh, yes. He knew exactly what he was 
doing. I'm quite convinced. And you can't be, you

19:08.315 --> 19:11.179
know, president. Executive Vice President of TRW 
Systems and Director of the Atomic Energy

19:11.615 --> 19:24.093
Commission as well as a Major General without 
knowing what you're doing. Yes, I thought he was a

19:24.113 --> 19:28.279
breath of fresh air and the most relaxed. Things 
went right on without great

19:38.007 --> 19:41.272
Horace Byers was academic vice president when I 
came. This is the day when paperwork is still at a

19:41.332 --> 19:47.722
minimum. He ran the academic vice president's 
office with, I think, an assistant and a

19:47.743 --> 19:55.715
secretary, and that was it. One of

19:58.259 --> 20:05.010
the Ag buildings.

20:10.487 --> 20:32.737
So, yeah, the only real interesting thing I had 
with Horace Byer was I was wanting to offer a

20:10.487 --> 20:32.737
position to Elias Thermas in political theory and 
discovered that I had to get permission to him,

20:10.487 --> 20:32.737
that Elias did not have his final naturalization 
paper. So I had to get permission to are a

20:36.260 --> 20:37.061
foreigner. So I wrote a semi-tongue-in-cheek 
note to Bayer that I'm requesting this because

20:38.303 --> 20:58.791
he's well qualified, he has a background, but also 
I think I'm hiring among other things to teach

20:38.303 --> 20:58.791
ancient political theory and I think it's highly 
appropriate that a Greek teach Plato and

20:38.303 --> 20:58.791
Aristotle.

21:01.555 --> 21:04.600
Dr. Byers approved it immediately.

21:06.743 --> 21:15.918
So, yeah, he was the only person, I think, in the 
whole blessed university faculty who was a member

21:06.743 --> 21:15.918
of the National Academy at that time. Yeah, 
T-H-E-R-M-I-S. T-H-E-R-M-O-S, like Thermos

21:18.202 --> 21:22.789
Jug.

21:25.533 --> 21:28.558
And then Dr. Byers retired. And John Calhoun 
became the vice president, and Williams is by then

21:29.315 --> 21:34.301
president. Describe your impression of them and 
working with them. Calhoun had some of the

21:37.946 --> 21:47.278
problems of an engineer understanding the social 
sciences. For example, I let my instructors

21:47.779 --> 21:58.613
teaching 206

21:47.779 --> 21:58.613
and 207 choose their own textbooks. Now, this was 
something Calhoun did not understand quite,

22:02.996 --> 22:12.487
because in the sciences, et cetera, you all agreed 
on a textbook. Well, I got cold on that, and I said,

22:12.507 --> 22:22.138
look, all our textbooks operate one 
constitution.

22:24.941 --> 22:27.604
They all revolve around it. And I said, in Texas, we 
got one constitution also. Now, this is our

22:34.732 --> 22:36.375
periodic table.

22:39.379 --> 22:46.991
And I said, so I said, if you order me, I will comply. 
But I said, they're getting substantially the

22:47.191 --> 22:57.827
same thing, but probably better because the 
people ordering textbooks are a little better

22:47.191 --> 22:57.827
able to teach it that way than some other way. So I 
said, this doesn't bother me. Then later

23:01.757 --> 23:19.759
on, we got some questions in the academic

23:01.757 --> 23:19.759
program committee, et cetera, about law.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.065
Why shouldn't all law be one place? Public law goes 
with business law. I said, well, we have no

23:31.793 --> 23:38.200
particular use for business law. They're well 
able to teach it. I have nobody here to teach the

23:41.183 --> 23:46.648
common law or contracts or other things. But I 
said, public law is constitutional law and

23:46.668 --> 23:56.458
administrative law, and the business people 
don't deal with that. Now, I said, we're not

23:56.478 --> 24:00.923
playing in each other's bailiwick, essentially. 
He finally understood that.

24:06.987 --> 24:20.479
He and I are still on good terms, but I had to explain 
these things to a dean who wasn't quite so sure of

24:06.987 --> 24:20.479
what we were doing. Well, I had one lecturer who was

24:32.763 --> 24:46.362
accused of sexual assault on a student, of having 
sexual relations with a student.

24:46.382 --> 24:48.344
I relieved him from teaching immediately. He came 
in and gave me the story. He said, yes, I had sexual

24:52.350 --> 24:55.214
relationship. We had a wonderful evening. She 
thoroughly enjoyed it. I said I can well believe it

24:58.261 --> 25:24.201
but where do we go from here I said I'm relieving you 
until this is settled from your teaching and

24:58.261 --> 25:24.201
meanwhile attend to your courses and hope for the 
best well I got I figured this story is going to get

24:58.261 --> 25:24.201
to Calhoun immediately and because the Carolyn 
Adair is in the Dean's office Dean of Students

25:24.940 --> 25:46.107
Office Dean of Students Office and she's all 
exercised over the girl so this gets to Calhoun and

25:24.940 --> 25:46.107
I figure I better be in early tomorrow morning 
because I'm going to get a call from Calhoun and I

25:24.940 --> 25:46.107
sure did about 8 15. I was there to answer I didn't 
always get in at 8 o'clock every morning. And he

25:54.463 --> 26:02.157
said,

25:54.463 --> 26:02.157
what's the story? And I gave him the story. And he 
said, you mean without consulting me, you

26:05.903 --> 26:12.695
relieved a faculty member of his teaching? I said, 
yes. Said, what would you think if it came out that I

26:15.481 --> 26:23.441
had not relieved him in the press? I had not 
relieved somebody so acute. That kept him quiet.

26:27.913 --> 26:30.840
What was his reaction to that response? He said, 
OK, I guess you have a point.

26:36.980 --> 26:44.891
I said, I'm on top of this, and

26:36.980 --> 26:44.891
we're handling it. Well, sure enough, after the 
girl was afraid of her parents' reaction,

26:52.302 --> 26:54.125
The girl would be candid afterward. It had been 
consensual, completely so.

27:03.258 --> 27:08.745
Did you have any, now your title was department 
head or chairman? Head. Head, all right. And what

27:11.349 --> 27:15.775
did that mean to you compared to chairman? Well, it 
was very clear what it meant.

27:21.175 --> 27:26.081
push came to shove, I could do it. And if you had your 
druthers today, would that be what A&M would do

27:28.464 --> 27:35.694
today? Which is better? I think in the long run 
chair is better

27:39.799 --> 27:49.832
because Head gives people like my predecessor,

27:51.230 --> 28:02.166
Hornance, delusions of grandeur, very easy. How 
long should the term be? Well, I thought the period

28:06.372 --> 28:12.601
that I served my terms were in terms of five years. 
And was there a review by some? Yeah, Maxwell had a

28:16.527 --> 28:20.072
review, and I started the second. term and two more 
years and I said I think this is I've done what I can

28:20.879 --> 28:32.474
do and the coordinating board's sitting on 
everything and somebody else can so we brought Sam

28:20.879 --> 28:32.474
Kirkpatrick in. Who's done pretty well since 
then. Yes I did think probably I said Dean if I'm

28:36.159 --> 28:47.534
resigning I said could I be chair to select of the 
committee to select my successor he said okay.

28:47.554 --> 28:49.857
It's a little unusual how did y'all find Sam? He 
came in by application. He was at Oklahoma? At

28:55.979 --> 28:57.381
Oklahoma, yes. He had just been, I also knew him, he 
had just been president of the Southern Political

28:57.542 --> 29:06.276
Science Convention in his early 30s. And he'd 
cleaned up a major scandal in that with very

29:07.117 --> 29:11.944
little. There'd been a treasurer who'd been 
around for years who was taking advantage of the

29:12.625 --> 29:18.714
place.

29:22.659 --> 29:29.950
And after being here, he went to Arizona State as 
dean. And then president at UT San Antonio, now

29:30.170 --> 29:35.217
retired. I don't know. No, I think he still is. 
Because he almost replaced me as president in 1987

29:42.472 --> 29:49.645
at UT El Paso. And I understand, that's my way of 
saying I don't, I'm not, I wouldn't stand up in

29:49.827 --> 30:05.107
court and say this is a fact, but I understand that 
it was a very close finish and that the board, the UT

29:49.827 --> 30:05.107
board kind of said, Dr. Kirkpatrick, just don't 
worry. We'll have other vacancies and we'll get

30:05.547 --> 30:08.091
back to you. And the next vacancy was at San Antonio 
and he was a good fit. All right, looking back on

30:12.957 --> 30:19.125
those years in leading political science here, of 
what are you most proud of?

30:22.227 --> 30:30.980
Oh, I think of just a collection of things, of 
getting things organized so the department had a

30:22.227 --> 30:30.980
quite firm base. And when compared numerically, 
compare your first year and your last year in terms

30:32.783 --> 30:40.795
of majors and degrees. Well, for example, when I 
came, we had 13 faculty equivalents. My last year,

30:47.686 --> 30:49.508
we had a faculty of 40. My, my. My last year as 
department head, we hired 10 people. It seemed to

30:56.031 --> 31:00.417
me I was visiting with faculty every day of the 
year. And in terms of degree, the master's, the MPA

31:01.959 --> 31:08.007
was underway fully. It had been designed and was 
before the coordinating board. Let's see, we

31:16.379 --> 31:17.360
skipped over. Did you have any relations with Dr. 
Williams? And any comments about him and his

31:20.260 --> 31:23.190
leadership? Not much, except I was in to visit him a 
couple of times.
