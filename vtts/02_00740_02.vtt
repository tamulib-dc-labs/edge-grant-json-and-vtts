WEBVTT

00:04.115 --> 00:06.138
Okay. I was on the farm until they disposed of the 
farm

00:06.158 --> 00:28.886
and then I got a job in 1924 for the Veterans 
Administration at Houston as an agriculture

00:06.158 --> 00:28.886
rehabilitation assistant. That job played out 
and Okay, what were your duties as this

00:31.418 --> 00:38.304
rehabilitation assistant? I was consulting, 
advising

00:39.465 --> 00:53.977
veterans of World War I that had what they called 
projects on different farms. They were scattered

00:54.017 --> 00:57.580
around over Texas. So you would give them advice on 
how to succeed in their Farming. Yeah, I had to do

01:02.184 --> 01:09.330
the farming and take care of some of their personal 
problems that they were having. But then that

01:09.350 --> 01:10.672
played out in 25. Yeah, that played out in 25. Then 
for that, for another time, I had hard sledding. I

01:18.820 --> 01:20.141
tried to sell insurance. I like insurance. I 
imagine that wasn't a great deal of fun, was it? No,

01:25.906 --> 01:27.288
that wasn't fun either. Then in 29 I went with the 
Department of Agriculture. And I've been there, I

01:39.235 --> 01:42.319
was there until I retired. And

01:42.360 --> 01:48.128
did you come directly to El Paso? Yes. And was in the 
Department of Agriculture? Came in the

01:51.753 --> 01:59.104
Department of Agriculture as a plant quarantine 
inspector.

01:59.573 --> 02:09.705
came as what they call an agent, but I took the 
examination in November 19, uh, 20,

01:59.573 --> 02:09.705
29.

02:11.768 --> 02:28.348
The time played out here in El Paso County and I was 
sent to, to, uh,

02:11.768 --> 02:28.348
in Arizona, Sentinel, Arizona. Well, in 
something out of Arizona, they got my grades and I

02:28.970 --> 02:45.330
had passed one out of,

02:28.970 --> 02:45.330
one of the seven of 49 that passed, I was one, and 
they sent me back here to El Paso. And I was then

02:47.653 --> 02:56.884
transferred in March 30 to Phavens and spent five 
years down in Phavens. and then transferred back

02:58.062 --> 03:04.030
up to El Paso in 35 and been here ever since.

03:05.912 --> 03:07.394
You said you were a plant inspector? Yeah, plant 
quarantine inspector. So in that position, what

03:11.019 --> 03:14.743
did you do? It was a station on the border on the, and 
inspected fruits and vegetables that came from

03:14.823 --> 03:26.458
Mexico. Into the United States. Yeah. So would you 
say if a man wanted to bring a truckload of oranges

03:30.344 --> 03:38.935
from Mexico into El Paso, you would inspect them? 
Well, some of that fruit's been prohibited. We

03:42.079 --> 03:44.542
were looking for prohibited fruit.

03:47.385 --> 03:49.448
Not very many of those fruits could pass.

03:55.175 --> 04:00.081
Did you have any particular exciting incidents 
while you were in? Working on the border?

04:04.999 --> 04:06.822
No, I went through it pretty quietly. Was it, what 
would you call it, smuggling? People wanting to

04:11.650 --> 04:13.874
bring in illegal fruit or something? Oh yeah, 
there's... Was there a good bit of that? There's

04:17.560 --> 04:20.424
not too much of it. During the time that you were on 
duty there from... the late what late 20s 29 up to

04:26.268 --> 04:51.010
your retirement what did you say would you say it 
was an increase or a decrease or did you remain

04:26.268 --> 04:51.010
about the same

04:26.268 --> 04:51.010
well i don't know the traffic increased and of 
course that would increase it would increase it

04:26.268 --> 04:51.010
but it would be i guess it would increase

04:53.960 --> 05:08.803
But say, you wouldn't be able to tell probably 
whether it was increased in the same proportion of

04:53.960 --> 05:08.803
the amount of traffic or not,

04:53.960 --> 05:08.803
huh? No. And at what point did you retire from the 
quarantine? Was it the quarantine service? Yeah.

05:16.095 --> 05:16.836
Department of Agriculture? Quarantine service. 
April the 30th.

05:24.554 --> 05:25.595
1958. 1958. So how have you been occupying your 
time since then? I've

05:32.503 --> 05:53.346
been enjoying most of the time, but I had a heart 
attack in in 59, a year after I retired, and for four

05:32.503 --> 05:53.346
years there I was held down pretty good, but after 
that I went on, went on pretty good. Do you

05:55.148 --> 06:01.982
participate in any kind of social or cultural or 
political activities? No, I'm strictly a home

06:02.964 --> 06:06.251
man. Just strictly a home man, huh? Okay.
