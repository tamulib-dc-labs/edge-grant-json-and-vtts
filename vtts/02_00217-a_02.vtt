WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:04.330
Oh, the day I arrived. And also what you got is a 
little tackle box. And in this tackle box you had a

00:08.878 --> 00:22.300
set of instruments and you had your French curves 
and your triangles and your engineering scale and

00:08.878 --> 00:22.300
your architect scale and all that went in there. 
And of course the set of pencils that you used it

00:22.320 --> 00:25.746
for. And Cliff Ransdell was my my second term 
engineering design engineering drawing

00:29.022 --> 00:57.460
describe him as a faculty as a teacher faculty 
member oh he was very nice and leisurely just like

00:29.022 --> 00:57.460
you know knew him too he's very kind and in fact all 
our teachers were i think bfk mullins i guess he was

00:29.022 --> 00:57.460
gone but he was one of the those profs there too did 
y'all have a nickname for rangel I don't remember

00:58.790 --> 00:59.951
it. I don't remember one. No? Economics. Do you 
remember who taught economics? No. Al Chalk

01:08.481 --> 01:10.083
wasn't here yet, was he? Who's that? Al Chalk. 
Chalk kind of was here. I don't know that I had him,

01:13.426 --> 01:15.028
though. Econ 203. Now, I presume that your slide 
rule and that tackle box was kind of the signature

01:22.499 --> 01:26.322
of an engineering student. Oh, sure. The slide 
rule was on a thing. I've got my slide rule in there

01:30.286 --> 01:32.328
now. Do you remember what it cost? I don't know, $4 
or $5, I guess. Do you remember in general what that

01:38.133 --> 01:42.717
first year cost? What your tuition was? You mean 
all of our books and everything? Oh, I can't say

01:45.740 --> 01:48.762
over $30 or $40.

01:50.484 --> 01:51.645
We also bought a drawing board with a handle on it. 
And I think my mama might have made a case to put that

01:56.928 --> 02:02.696
thing in, a canvas or a friend did. So we'd have that 
drawing board too you had to haul along,

02:02.736 --> 02:08.844
particularly back in the dorm because you did a lot 
of work. My roommate Bill Atkinson finished

02:09.805 --> 02:13.970
second in his class. He won the freshman math 
contest and won the national lettering contest,

02:21.308 --> 02:23.370
and he worked hard at it. But his sophomore year, he 
only got second place. Spencer Bain? Spencer got

02:29.997 --> 02:40.167
second place in the freshman contest, but he 
always throws it up to me that he got first in the

02:29.997 --> 02:40.167
sophomore class, and my roommate only got second.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.295
As you think back about it, Which of the courses 
consumed the greatest amount of time? Well,

02:54.295 --> 02:56.799
electrical engineering courses did. Oh, yeah. 
You had a lab for each one, for one thing. And you

03:01.265 --> 03:07.634
students were very much profession-oriented. 
You were really serious about becoming

03:08.756 --> 03:11.860
electrical engineers. Oh, I think so. I don't know 
that I even should have taken electrical

03:13.082 --> 03:18.670
engineering, but I was I'm not in a dilemma. My 
sophomore year, we had Bill Atkinson in my squad,

03:20.392 --> 03:28.019
and the other guy was equally as smart, and they'd 
run experiments. They didn't need to. They were

03:29.200 --> 03:37.247
both amateur radio operators, and a lot of the 
double E's were hams, and that's how they got

03:29.200 --> 03:37.247
interested in electrical engineering. So I 
didn't learn as much as they did, and they didn't

03:38.188 --> 03:42.952
need it either anyway, like I did. Now, you were 
saying that the primary emphasis was then power.

03:48.468 --> 03:53.577
Did you hear anything before you left for military 
service? Did you hear anything that hinted about

03:54.238 --> 03:59.186
the coming events in electronics? Well, yes, of 
course. We still had just the vacuum tube, so the

04:03.574 --> 04:08.763
applications were fairly limited. Field theory 
was more and more important. And what happened in

04:13.527 --> 04:23.060
World War II, the U.S. Army and so forth did a good 
job of recruiting people for good discipline. So

04:23.080 --> 04:25.884
many telephone company men got in. They gave them 
direct commission to teach. Well, anyway, my

04:29.089 --> 04:37.340
roommate and these other two that went in the Navy, 
they wound up at Harvard and MIT in radar. In other

04:38.422 --> 04:40.885
words, they got the theoretical thing and How they 
picked these out, I don't know. Rodenberger, you

04:45.244 --> 04:49.150
know, I don't mean Rodenberger. His wife is a 
history prof. Underberger. Underberger.

04:56.460 --> 05:07.094
Underberger was a physics major, and they also 
sent him to MIT and to Harvard because of the need

04:56.460 --> 05:07.094
for this sort of thing. So they recruited well in 
that respect. All right, let's see. Other events.

05:16.745 --> 05:20.612
What did the YMCA offer? What did a student do at the 
YMCA? Well, of course, freshmen couldn't go in

05:24.819 --> 05:27.043
there. The bowling alley was in the basement. 
Underneath the bowling alley was a swimming pool.

05:33.474 --> 05:36.960
And when they built PL downs, they covered it over. 
And the only reason you could go into the YMCA is go

05:37.733 --> 05:42.357
to church on Sunday. But as a sophomore, you didn't 
go to YMCA? Well, you could go in there. I bowled in

05:45.700 --> 05:47.162
there somewhat. But one thing that ended me is a 
couple of kids in there could go in there and play

05:48.182 --> 05:55.029
ping pong, and I couldn't. Well, it was Jim Cashin 
and Red Cashin because their daddy was the YMCA

05:55.049 --> 06:01.274
secretary. And they tells about how they swam in 
that pool. Wow. Now, they lived on campus. They

06:08.414 --> 06:09.855
lived on campus. And they were, by your standards, 
they were little boys, weren't they? Yeah, they

06:13.760 --> 06:14.601
were. See, they're five, seven years younger. Jim 
was a quarterback after World War II. He was about

06:21.430 --> 06:24.273
four or five years younger than Red, about six. All 
right, I'm going to interview Red on Monday

06:24.854 --> 06:28.338
morning. Describe for me your impression of Red 
and Jim as little boys. Oh, I can't remember them

06:32.924 --> 06:35.787
other than I just remember them playing in there 
and find out who they were and wondering how in the

06:35.969 --> 06:41.057
world they would get in there to play. So you don't 
remember any mischief? No, not really.

06:45.323 --> 06:57.541
Incidentally, with WTAW,

06:45.323 --> 06:57.541
the transmitter was in Bolton Hall and the studio 
was on the second floor of the YMCA. And they had

06:58.262 --> 07:04.491
antennas on each of those buildings with the wire 
in between. And Dutch Dillingham He got pictures

07:06.108 --> 07:16.679
of him way back there in the 30s, and of course the 
first broadcast of a game was on WTAW and this sort

07:06.108 --> 07:16.679
of thing. All right, now it was operated in that 
day, operated by A&M, by the electrical

07:17.580 --> 07:25.208
engineering department? No, by students, so 
N-double-E. But it was, of course, a university

07:27.430 --> 07:31.615
station even then. What kind of programs did they 
have? I can't remember, really. They just played

07:35.756 --> 07:37.959
music as far as I know. Did they do football games in 
your day? Or did Kern Tips do them? Oh, Kern Tips did

07:43.986 --> 07:45.208
them. Oh, yeah. WTAW has gotten away from that 
then. Oh, yeah. Umbel Oil and Refining Company.

07:51.776 --> 07:53.579
What kind of music did they play? I can't remember 
that either, but I'm sure it's the popular music of

07:53.599 --> 07:57.383
the day. Glenn Miller and Harry James and people 
like that. All right, let's see. Guyon Hall was the

08:02.909 --> 08:05.412
auditorium. Tell me about, describe some events 
you remember occurring in Guyon Hall. Well, of

08:13.043 --> 08:19.191
course, at that time, we had Math 101. They all took 
the math final exam at the same time. So they would

08:22.805 --> 08:30.574
put us all in Gine Hall, and this was even true when I 
came back and started teaching in 56. They still

08:31.496 --> 08:37.903
had exams, a common exam for one course, and they'd 
spread us out in Gine Hall. And, of course, we had

08:39.325 --> 08:50.078
the Holy Week or Religious Emphasis Week in the 
spring, and so each day you would have a program

08:39.325 --> 08:50.078
there. And they would dismass classes so you could 
go to these. Was there good turnout for those? Oh, I

08:56.982 --> 08:59.168
think there was, yeah. I don't know that I ever 
went. I grew up a Christian scientist. And we had

09:02.832 --> 09:08.199
our little services up on the second floor of the 
YMCA. How many attended that Christian Science?

09:10.542 --> 09:12.424
Oh, I'd say maybe five or ten. And one of the 
students was the reader. Were there any other, and

09:15.688 --> 09:30.666
let me call that as a non-mainline denomination, 
were there any other religious groups that had

09:15.688 --> 09:30.666
meetings here that weren't mainline 
denominations? I don't think so. Oh, I can't

09:32.515 --> 09:33.356
remember. The Presbyterians met in the YMCA. The 
Methodists had a kind of an old barn up there where

09:38.361 --> 09:43.167
they are now. The Catholics have an old chapel on 
the corner. And that was it. Uh-huh. Do you

09:49.834 --> 09:52.937
remember any Jewish students when you were here? 
Well, of course, the Hillel Foundation was quite

09:53.017 --> 09:55.860
strong. And we, I think, had a real good 
representation of the Jewish community and they

09:59.380 --> 10:02.284
were right into the rest of us. I can't say where and 
when they went. Do you remember, do you have any

10:06.949 --> 10:18.904
recollection, what was the respect and or 
toleration of the different religious groups?

10:18.924 --> 10:23.830
How did Aggies feel about someone else's 
religious affiliation? Oh, I don't think we had

10:23.850 --> 10:27.835
any prejudices at all particularly. We weren't 
very religious, most of us, I would say. Were there

10:34.531 --> 10:39.356
some Hispanic students in your, in your? Yeah, we 
had three or four, yeah. And did they have certain

10:42.979 --> 10:45.141
special nicknames? No, they were just one of the, 
one of the students, yeah. What about some

10:49.246 --> 10:50.967
international students? Were there some from 
other countries? Very little, I don't know. The

10:54.591 --> 10:57.754
Zuniga, he was from, the way to Laredo, and I got him 
to come back after 50 years, and De La Chica, I don't

10:58.122 --> 11:18.081
know, he stayed around for a while, yeah, but I, 
other than that, Martinez was a sophomore, we

10:58.122 --> 11:18.081
didn't like him, and his roommate was Jewish, but 
that didn't make any difference, yeah. Let's see,

11:18.601 --> 11:27.049
do you remember any notable celebrities that came 
to the campus in those pre-war years? Well, of

11:27.772 --> 11:38.486
course, the one we had, we've never been licked 
while you had all that, Wallace Berry Jr. and Jim

11:27.772 --> 11:38.486
Mitchell, or what is his name, Mitchum? Robert 
Mitchum. Robert Mitchum, and then the third one

11:40.049 --> 11:43.613
and the two women. I've got the tape of the thing, 
too, and we were in that thing, of course. Describe

11:49.501 --> 11:53.266
the campus excitement about that. When we had them 
here, we spent a lot of time out on the drill field,

11:57.033 --> 12:02.962
just more or less having reviews and this sort of 
thing. And it hardly got into the film at all. But

12:08.070 --> 12:13.178
the hero in this thing was in disgrace, kind of. And 
in my outfit, we marched right up a military walk up

12:14.320 --> 12:20.510
into Sabisa Dining Hall. And so... And it was my 
outfit that tripped him as he went up the stairs.

12:28.974 --> 12:43.358
What happened was he had, this hero had grown up in 
Japan and he came to school late and all that stuff

12:28.974 --> 12:43.358
and he finally got with it and that sort of thing and 
his senior year he has boots and this sort of thing.

12:44.806 --> 12:48.712
But he kind of defended the Japanese because he had 
lived there. Well, this made him, of course,

12:48.732 --> 12:53.760
Persia non grata and all that stuff. It didn't have 
anything to do with him. As I say, they tripped him

12:55.803 --> 12:58.387
as he went up the steps. And then he went on over to 
Japan and became a Japanese broadcaster and so

12:59.108 --> 13:06.039
forth. And he got on an aircraft carrier, and he sat 
behind the pilots. And he heard his roommate,

13:12.700 --> 13:17.167
which was Wallace Berry Jr., told him he was. And so 
he choked the Japanese pilot and caused the plane

13:17.267 --> 13:26.121
to crash into the Japanese carrier. And so they 
awarded him the Congressional Medal of Honor, and

13:26.722 --> 13:32.952
he had his boots at my coffee, and that sort of 
thing. That was really the corniest movie I think I

13:33.733 --> 13:36.878
ever saw. Where did all those movie stars stay? 
when they were here? I guess they put them up in the

13:41.482 --> 13:46.409
Aggieland Inn, right across the street from Sbisa 
Hall. They were here weeks? Were they here weeks?

13:49.694 --> 13:50.035
Months? Oh, they didn't stay very long. No, just 
the external scenes and also in the Sbisa Hall

13:52.518 --> 14:04.476
where they danced, but all of the indoor scenes 
were back in Hollywood. And even the stuff where he

14:04.810 --> 14:11.258
got onto the horse drone, field artillery, they 
were all back in Hollywood. Obviously, they

14:11.358 --> 14:15.743
weren't here from the terrain they were in. Other 
celebrities before you went away to the war, did

14:16.964 --> 14:25.314
the big bands come here and play during that? Oh, 
definitely. Oh, yeah. And of course, what you had

14:26.696 --> 14:33.484
in the spring, you had a regimental ball on Friday 
night where a certain regiment had their ball, and

14:33.886 --> 14:37.171
then Saturday night was the core dance. So they 
played for both nights. And we had Glenn Miller and

14:41.857 --> 14:48.987
Harry James and any number of the big-name 
orchestras came here. And these were in Sabisa? In

14:51.230 --> 14:53.794
Sabisa, the main dining hall of Sabisa. That's the 
only place there. I think we might have had one over

14:55.516 --> 15:03.167
here in the new area on one side of the dining hall at 
the core area. Did you have a date come down? Oh,

15:05.615 --> 15:21.361
yeah, I had a date, and I went and got a car, got 
folks' car that weekend, so I went up and brought my

15:05.615 --> 15:21.361
date back, and also a friend in the outfit, his 
date, and I also brought back her mother. I didn't

15:22.904 --> 15:29.695
intend for that to happen, but we put them up over in 
blue bonnet cores. You know, the building where

15:30.113 --> 15:36.842
the restaurant is right next to Jones Pharmacy 
now. It's a cottage type, so that's where I had to

15:36.922 --> 15:40.167
put them up. How was a young woman treated at an 
Aggie dance? At a dance? You couldn't dance with

15:47.517 --> 15:48.739
her. I mean, always, if somebody was always 
cutting in, you'd bring your date, and you didn't

15:49.740 --> 15:59.614
get to dance with her very much because most of us 
didn't have dates. And so here we were, and so you

15:59.948 --> 16:04.052
kept cutting in all the time. You could never dance 
a whole night, a whole date, a whole dance with one

16:04.592 --> 16:11.258
person. But were the girls treated like royalty? 
Oh, I think so. And of course, we vacated one of the

16:16.123 --> 16:23.770
dormitories, and they stayed in that dormitory, 
and we found out where we could stay anywhere on the

16:16.123 --> 16:23.770
campus. You didn't have enough room. Some of them 
stayed off campus in in the faculty housing and on

16:27.995 --> 16:31.461
campus and so forth. But by and large, that's where 
we had to put them up.

16:37.271 --> 16:39.736
Was there much drinking at an Aggie dance? No, not 
at all. I don't believe at all. You might have a

16:43.442 --> 16:47.269
drink ahead of time, There were no tables around. 
You had chairs all the way around. Strictly

16:52.861 --> 16:53.722
dancing. We had lots of chaperones, the faculty 
wives and so forth. And every student was in

16:57.167 --> 16:59.670
uniform? Yeah. The only people that didn't wear a 
uniform were graduate students. And they didn't

17:06.379 --> 17:08.021
participate in that. We didn't have many graduate 
students either. And also, a lot of them wore

17:09.723 --> 17:11.385
uniform. They had to, anyway. So we didn't have 
much graduate school. Were there any, talking

17:16.291 --> 17:26.464
about celebrities coming, were there any 
important national leaders who came before you

17:16.291 --> 17:26.464
went away to the war? Well, of course, President 
Roosevelt came. Did he? During the war, yeah. Did

17:30.549 --> 17:31.330
you get to see him? I just remember he was here. I'm 
not sure what year it was. I do remember Dutch

17:38.059 --> 17:45.488
Dillingham saying that he got a really good PA 
system for him when he was out on Carl Field. And

17:49.022 --> 17:54.911
then he said Roosevelt knew exactly how to handle 
it, but, you know, keeping feedback, he'd say

17:49.022 --> 17:54.911
something, take it out of the way. He knew not to get 
the feedback. So he was a very accomplished

17:57.595 --> 17:59.678
speaker.

18:02.462 --> 18:12.758
Describe in those pre-war, pre-going away to the 
war year, describe the routine of a football, home

18:02.462 --> 18:12.758
football Saturday. What time did things begin? 
Well, you had midnight yell practice the night

18:15.860 --> 18:23.469
before, but the games were all in the afternoon. 
Where was midnight yell practice held? Midnight

18:26.532 --> 18:28.675
yell practice, was that held at the Y? That was in 
front of the YMCA. Later on, they moved it over in

18:31.658 --> 18:34.221
front of Goodman Hall. It had more room there. But 
as soon as the meal was over, we went over to the

18:36.852 --> 18:40.435
stadium. The freshmen sat in front, sophomores, 
juniors, and seniors. We didn't march in. You're

18:45.560 --> 18:47.882
talking about the noon meal. After the noon meal, 
we immediately went over and got us a good seat. And

18:52.066 --> 18:56.350
so we didn't march in or anything at all like that. 
And after the game was over, if we won, we went back

18:57.611 --> 19:03.737
over to the YMCA and had another yell practice. And 
did y'all throw the yell-eaters in the? No. That

19:07.901 --> 19:08.421
wasn't? No, no, that wasn't in it at all. Did 
anybody ever tear down a goal post? Never did that.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.592
Oh, no, they didn't feel like that. And did you ever 
have, did you have many dates for a football game? I

19:22.759 --> 19:30.568
only had, that date I was, and then also I had a girl 
who got over here from Austin, And so we took them to

19:31.882 --> 19:36.186
the dance, and they wanted to go out to Uncle Ed's. 
So we took them out to Uncle Ed Hard Liquor. You

19:39.969 --> 19:41.110
familiar with it? Now, that was on Welborn Road? 
Welborn Road, just about where

19:44.333 --> 19:51.880
Luther hits it. It's kind of on the corner there. 
It's still there. It's a little Chinese place, one

19:54.962 --> 20:00.167
story, about a half mile south of George Bush. So we 
took them out there because, you know, it was

20:00.890 --> 20:06.697
famous from a song, and it was a mess. It really was 
awful. The gals didn't like it. They wanted to go,

20:10.161 --> 20:11.322
though. They knew about it, so we took them out 
there. Now, beer, was beer available there? Was

20:17.550 --> 20:18.211
what now? Beer. Was there any beer and hard 
liquors? Oh, yeah, beer. Beer was the only thing

20:22.275 --> 20:24.158
you could get in the county. But not whiskey? No, no 
hard liquor. No, no, no. There was hard liquor out

20:28.987 --> 20:31.669
there, but no whiskey. And did he serve food? I 
think so. What was it? We just went out there to

20:37.294 --> 20:39.176
drink beer, though. The girls didn't drink beer. 
About how many people could Mr. Hard Liquor's

20:42.239 --> 20:47.023
place accommodate? Hard liquor? Not very many. I 
would say you couldn't get 100 people in there,

20:50.025 --> 20:53.969
even that much. Was it ever rowdy? Routy over what? 
Was it ever rowdy? Were there fights? Not at all. I

21:00.723 --> 21:05.009
didn't really go out there, but it was really just a 
place to drink beer. Because I've heard mention of

21:05.029 --> 21:08.614
Uncle Ed's, a great day. Yeah, drank our troubles 
away. Let's see, midnight yell practice, were

21:12.178 --> 21:16.885
there silver taps? Oh yeah, we had those once, 
twice a year, but we didn't kill many Aggies. Do you

21:23.560 --> 21:29.547
remember your feelings as you went to your first 
Silver Taps events? Oh, I can certainly remember

21:30.227 --> 21:33.411
it, and it was a very solemn occasion. That's about 
all I could say about it. Was Aggie, was Muster held

21:36.294 --> 21:39.978
before the war that you remember? Yes, it was. Of 
course, it became famous during the war, but I...

21:42.321 --> 21:50.310
Where was it held? I can't remember where the 
muster was held.

22:01.227 --> 22:05.053
Let's see, after that first summer, did you have a 
job at home? For the summer, I got a job for a quarter

22:06.135 --> 22:13.007
of an hour out of Seville. They were building a new 
federal prison out there, and I had a friend who

22:13.527 --> 22:18.191
helped me get the job. So we put together storage 
cabinets at 25 cents an hour. That's about the only

22:23.616 --> 22:26.018
job I had that summer. And that didn't relate much 
to electrical engineering? No, it sure didn't.

22:31.623 --> 22:34.146
There's hardly any jobs like that available at 
all. That was the summer of 40. Of 40. What about the

22:37.088 --> 22:38.149
next summer? The next summer, I went to summer 
school one of the times, yeah. Describe

22:44.712 --> 22:50.779
the community of College Station. What was there 
around the campus then, housing and so forth? How

22:56.006 --> 22:57.728
big was the—? Well, of course, when you crossed the 
stop sign up here, Park Place, There was nothing

23:06.008 --> 23:10.614
this side of it, even when we moved here back in 
1956. It stopped at Park Place, except for the

23:10.874 --> 23:15.360
Knoll out there. And I really can't remember much 
of all the houses on campus. I remember that,

23:21.468 --> 23:31.020
the PMS&T, and of course Gilchrist was living in 
that house. It's a brick house, one story. He was

23:34.381 --> 23:34.981
there. He was dean of engineering, man. That's 
about all I can remember. I think the student

23:39.206 --> 23:43.231
engineer's council would go over there and meet 
with him once in a while. And the Northgate area,

23:43.651 --> 23:48.476
what was there? Well, of course, on each of the 
corners was a drug store, and there were two or

23:48.957 --> 23:54.864
three barber shops. Lupo was kind of down towards 
the campus, and that was about all there was to it.

24:00.987 --> 24:05.233
That first block was all there was to the north gate 
of the business district. The Baptists, I don't

24:06.875 --> 24:09.939
know when they built their church. The Church of 
Christ was there, and as I say, the Methodist

24:10.399 --> 24:15.045
church was just a big old barn. The railroad 
station I know was active. Where was the bus

24:20.052 --> 24:21.574
station? The what now? The bus station. Where did 
you catch the bus? Well, of course, the bus came up

24:25.490 --> 24:30.776
to the Aggieland Inn. The Greyhound bus drove up 
there to pick up passengers. So that's where you

24:34.700 --> 24:36.001
came from. And the post office, where did you get 
your mail? Okay, where the Trigon is, and this side

24:41.267 --> 24:48.735
of it is now that utility building. When they built 
the new dorms, they put a post office there, too.

24:54.059 --> 24:58.904
And they had a little confectionery, too, so 
that's where our post office boxes were. And if you

25:00.745 --> 25:08.433
wanted to buy a Coca-Cola or anything like that 
during the day, where would you go? You'd have to go

25:08.453 --> 25:09.554
over there. That was the nearest place. Of course, 
the upperclassmen had concessions in the dorm,

25:12.557 --> 25:15.579
too. They had something to sell, I can't remember. 
Do you remember where you were when you heard the

25:19.463 --> 25:23.627
news of Pearl Harbor? I was at Guyon Hall watching a 
movie. And when we came out, we got the news. How

25:31.744 --> 25:34.669
did, did a friend tell you? Word of mouth. We got 
around, you know. And what did you and your friends

25:38.175 --> 25:39.918
do then? Well, we had, one of our friends, we had a 
kind of a dormitory communication system. could

25:47.738 --> 25:55.949
get on the radio, and he got on there like he was a 
Japanese and started talking about what was

25:47.738 --> 25:55.949
happening and all that stuff. So that was the main 
thing. Of course, we really realized what was

25:57.411 --> 26:01.577
happening. Did you and your buddies know where 
Pearl Harbor was? Oh, I don't know. Hawaiian

26:07.224 --> 26:09.187
Island, that's all. I was a sixth grader, and I 
remember we had to have it explained to us, of

26:10.649 --> 26:16.817
course. were there any other, in those first three 
years here, were there any other events that kind

26:17.472 --> 26:30.144
of stopped you and your buddies in your tracks? 
After Pearl Harbor? No, I don't really believe we

26:33.988 --> 26:45.859
were, because D-Day, of course, was after we had 
all gone, just following it, the progress of it, we

26:47.527 --> 26:52.014
And I know for me, the death of Franklin Roosevelt 
in 1944.

26:56.261 --> 26:56.741
Let's see. We're still talking about the pre-war 
years. The average student, was there much beer

27:01.809 --> 27:08.019
consumed by students then? There was a lot of 
liquor consumed on the dorms. You know, they'd

27:12.215 --> 27:15.258
bring a bottle in and drink and this sort of thing. A 
fair amount of that. My first drink, I went over to

27:18.421 --> 27:26.248
White Way Cafe, which is about where 7-Eleven is, 
and that's where I got my first beer. And then we

27:26.789 --> 27:30.592
walked back over to the camp and had a few beers, and 
that was it. Did many students get drunk? No, I

27:34.536 --> 27:36.818
don't think a whole lot of it. All right, so beer, 
whiskey. What about tobacco? Did many students

27:43.463 --> 27:44.244
smoke? Oh, we had plenty of smokers. Oh, yeah. And 
chewing tobacco? I don't think so, no. Snuff? I

27:51.972 --> 27:54.494
can't remember that they had that at all. Did you 
and your buddies know of any other indulgences? I

27:58.919 --> 28:03.684
don't believe there's anything at all in the way of 
drugs or anything like that. Did you even know the

28:03.804 --> 28:05.005
words? No, I don't really think we did. Marijuana 
we called Mary Jane. When I was a kid in the park in

28:10.282 --> 28:15.450
Dallas, you'd talk about Mary Jane a little bit. 
Did you ever see any Mary Jane? No. That's what they

28:19.015 --> 28:20.757
called marijuana, though.

28:24.222 --> 28:24.703
Let's see. Court trip. Describe court trip during 
those falls. Well, of course, if it was in Houston,

28:33.696 --> 28:39.765
we'd hitchhike and spend the night before in a 
downtown hotel, and then for the rice game, of

28:40.420 --> 28:47.832
course, we would march in Houston. I do remember 
staying in the Cotton Hotel and getting pretty

28:48.513 --> 28:55.665
drunk there, you know, away from home and this sort 
of thing. Of course, Dallas and Fort Worth was my

28:56.106 --> 29:01.635
home in Dallas, so we'd just stay at home. Did you 
have a few guests at your house then? No, not

29:05.561 --> 29:07.204
really, uh-uh. Either Dallas or Fort Worth would 
be one of the other games for SSMU or TCU. And Waco,

29:13.279 --> 29:15.181
we didn't march in Waco. You know why we no longer 
marched in Waco, yeah. Let's see. There was a court

29:22.470 --> 29:24.392
trip to Austin. In Austin, we were. And I had a high 
school roommate in the dorm there, so I slept on the

29:26.034 --> 29:32.242
floor. And, of course, after that, 40 game and we 
lost, we were going to spend the night. But after we

29:38.866 --> 29:41.730
lost, we got out of town. I got a high school 
classmate and we just high-tailed up at Waco and

29:42.391 --> 29:49.401
stopped for supper. And then a goofy guy, he got 
over on the left-hand side, a car came the other way

29:49.461 --> 29:56.651
and hit us on the rear. And I was in the back rear seat 
and we went over and turned over on our side and And

30:03.209 --> 30:08.597
this car that came behind us got over on the other 
side and the guy was killed in that thing. We

30:10.620 --> 30:14.986
hauled, they hauled the car in and we had to 
hitchhike home. Back to that 1940 game in Austin. I

30:19.673 --> 30:26.583
described the feelings of the Aggies in the... We 
just stood up in the grand and cried. Like babies,

30:26.884 --> 30:28.386
no fooling. We were going to the Rose Bowl. He 
already had the invitations. A number of years

30:33.263 --> 30:49.759
later, old Homer Norton's daughter was with us on 
the way to Mexico with my wife for Spanish, and we

30:33.263 --> 30:49.759
drove by there, and I told her, I said, this is the 
saddest place your daddy ever experienced in that

30:33.263 --> 30:49.759
stadium there. Of course, he had that place across 
the street and his wife. Did you students have any

30:54.723 --> 31:01.870
impression of him in his coaching days here? Homer 
Norton? Oh, not particularly. I guess he's kind of

31:05.427 --> 31:07.810
autocratic, I guess. I can't say more than that. 
Like one of the things I learned from Barney Welch

31:10.193 --> 31:28.776
that causes me, in hindsight, to respect Coach 
Norton, Barney said that Coach Norton promised

31:10.193 --> 31:28.776
every single athlete that had a scholarship who 
went away to the war, when you come back, you will

31:10.193 --> 31:28.776
have a scholarship. And he said what hurt was that 
he kept his word And some of those were not that good

31:32.039 --> 31:37.456
as athletes four years later. But he kept his word. 
Barney was pretty good.
