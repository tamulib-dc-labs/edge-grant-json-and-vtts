WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:10.847
Anyway, we'd let them do three, maybe four within the show, as long as it made some sense.

00:12.369 --> 00:15.894
And the audience could enjoy it instead of saying, what are they doing?

00:16.214 --> 00:17.216
You know, that kind of thing.

00:17.496 --> 00:22.923
Now, you mean that they would have new words to the... Oh, they'd add some, yeah, they'd change.

00:23.304 --> 00:28.030
And sometimes it wouldn't be more than like three words within a song.

00:28.702 --> 00:30.645
But I knew it, and they knew it.

00:31.226 --> 00:35.454
The audience on those cases wasn't even probably aware of it.

00:35.975 --> 00:38.579
But they'd do slapstick stuff.

00:40.022 --> 00:44.590
I always tried to include some sort of a novelty piece.

00:45.271 --> 00:52.043
And we used to do the quartet from Rigoletto in costume.

00:52.023 --> 01:00.134
And some costume pieces about the army, making fun of the army and military.

01:01.396 --> 01:08.726
We'd always try to include something that was really slapstick almost.

01:11.831 --> 01:15.796
But never off-color and never raucous.

01:18.540 --> 01:19.802
It had to be entertaining.

01:21.217 --> 01:25.083
Or why bother, as far as the way I looked at it.

01:25.103 --> 01:28.227
You saw it in an audience's intelligence if you go too far.

01:28.908 --> 01:34.477
So your food never got seasoned by then?

01:34.857 --> 01:35.979
Oh, well, yeah, okay.

01:38.302 --> 01:41.487
It must have been in the 60s because it was still in Guyon Hall.

01:42.867 --> 01:52.388
I used to always take a glass of water out with me because I would sing a solo.

01:53.245 --> 01:56.168
and put it on the piano very carefully.

01:57.009 --> 01:59.031
And I'd take a sip before I did my solo.

01:59.591 --> 02:03.695
Well, one year, the guys put peppermint in that water.

02:04.216 --> 02:08.760
And of course, as soon as it touched me, I knew there was something wrong.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.801
I didn't know what exactly.

02:10.101 --> 02:14.606
But I just spewed it all over the piano and over June Beering.

02:15.687 --> 02:17.648
And they never let me forget that.

02:17.709 --> 02:21.312
Then they tried another year to put a goldfish in the glass.

02:21.646 --> 02:25.475
So I got to the point there where I stopped taking anything out on stage.

02:26.477 --> 02:37.663
One of the traditions within the group in the old days, too, was when we'd accept a new man, at one of the following rehearsals,

02:38.335 --> 02:44.043
he would have to sing a solo for the guys.

02:44.063 --> 02:47.608
Well when they finished there was never any applause or anything.

02:48.049 --> 02:49.772
But they'd flip pennies at him.

02:50.713 --> 02:59.205
And I'd have to clean the piano out of pennies regularly because they'd get on the soundboard and start vibrating or on the strings.

03:00.006 --> 03:02.470
But that was a tradition.

03:03.277 --> 03:05.841
I don't know what happened to that, really.

03:06.802 --> 03:09.887
It wouldn't matter if the audition was good or bad.

03:10.348 --> 03:15.035
You know, they just flip over and... Didn't try to hit them.

03:15.635 --> 03:19.902
So that when y'all stopped to eat on the road, they never tried to season your food for you?

03:20.242 --> 03:21.164
No, no, no.

03:21.184 --> 03:21.384
Okay.

03:22.966 --> 03:24.529
No prank phone calls?

03:24.549 --> 03:26.291
We rarely stopped to eat on the road.

03:28.495 --> 03:30.718
Unless it was a really long haul.

03:31.103 --> 03:37.553
And we'd make pit stops because too many people were using the restroom on the bus.

03:39.836 --> 03:44.444
And we'd get drinks and junk food.

03:45.325 --> 03:48.169
But we were always overfed on tour.

03:48.610 --> 03:53.077
I mean the guys would always gain eight to ten pounds on a ten day tour.

03:54.119 --> 03:57.043
You know, Mama's going to take care of that boy.

03:58.930 --> 04:04.718
And if we had group meals, and we rarely did, but we did sometimes, we'd have group meals.

04:04.778 --> 04:13.389
We'd have things like chicken spaghetti and tamales, you know, just all kinds of stuff.

04:13.990 --> 04:16.653
But no, they all gained weight on tour.

04:17.474 --> 04:23.242
Did you ever have any poignant events that can be added to this tape?

04:25.024 --> 04:25.545
Touching.

04:27.955 --> 04:33.924
Well, I remember singing at General Rudder's funeral, graveside.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.870
I remember singing at Pinky Downs funeral.

04:38.651 --> 04:40.033
Can you describe that?

04:40.374 --> 04:47.244
Well, it's just a great moving experience.

04:47.384 --> 04:53.173
And it's very hard to sing there, you know, because we're all emotionally involved with what we're doing.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.578
Did Pinky come to your rehearsals ever?

04:56.812 --> 04:58.817
Oh yeah.

04:59.659 --> 05:00.922
But not too often.

05:01.343 --> 05:07.918
But yeah he'd even come and he'd just walk it.

05:08.911 --> 05:10.293
Yeah, that's good.

05:10.313 --> 05:16.180
Now, I remember him, correct me if I, I remember him as a comparatively thin, small man.

05:16.540 --> 05:16.801
Right.

05:18.242 --> 05:18.943
They're doing Dexter.

05:19.204 --> 05:20.265
Boundless energy.

05:20.705 --> 05:22.327
Oh, yeah.

05:22.347 --> 05:27.334
Always seemed to be moving around the campus, here, there, everywhere.

05:27.614 --> 05:30.177
He was a thin version of Lupo.

05:30.157 --> 05:33.387
If you know what I mean.

05:33.448 --> 05:34.090
My friend.

05:35.133 --> 05:38.524
Well Pinky was a hellfella well met.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.955
He just always, never turned it off.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.812
Now, we're talking about P.L.

05:43.852 --> 05:46.777
Downs, Jr., who grew up, I think, in Temple.

05:47.598 --> 05:54.108
And I learned the other day it was a member of what was then the Board of Directors, now Board of Regents, in the 1920s.

05:54.389 --> 05:56.252
Right, right.

05:56.272 --> 06:01.780
And you would have never known that, to know him around campus.

06:02.621 --> 06:03.623
I mean, he was a...

06:04.970 --> 06:13.104
He was a fixture, no question, but he was also kind of a give you an elbow kind of thing.

06:14.786 --> 06:18.513
A lot of people ridiculed him in many ways.

06:19.334 --> 06:21.317
But I always loved that gentleman.

06:22.359 --> 06:24.683
He lived next to the Lancasters.

06:24.663 --> 06:28.170
over by the Hillel Foundation.

06:29.233 --> 06:33.241
And he and his wife were lovers.

06:33.662 --> 06:34.785
I mean they were lovers.

06:35.085 --> 06:38.432
Everywhere they went they held hands.

06:38.452 --> 06:39.074
It was beautiful.

06:39.094 --> 06:39.735
I loved them.

06:40.222 --> 06:43.368
Now, you were the director for how many years?

06:43.388 --> 06:44.309
To what year?

06:44.329 --> 06:44.790
35 years.

06:45.511 --> 06:46.513
60 to 95.

06:46.553 --> 06:47.254
95.

06:47.274 --> 06:47.695
All right.

06:48.977 --> 07:00.237
Compare the singing cadets and the routine and everything near 95 to what it was near 60.

07:00.538 --> 07:02.461
How did we change in 35 years?

07:02.641 --> 07:03.142
Oh, wow.

07:03.583 --> 07:04.204
Well...

07:05.078 --> 07:12.344
The main change as far as the singing cadets is concerned is not being corps anymore.

07:15.227 --> 07:27.898
Now, we're lucky if we can get four, maybe five guys in the corps in the singing cadets.

07:28.158 --> 07:28.798
Out of 60.

07:28.938 --> 07:31.421
Yeah.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.343
We went through a period of time

07:34.441 --> 07:35.684
where the Corps outfits.

07:36.847 --> 07:52.585
See, the singing cadets, if they were in the singing cadets, in the Corps, they got credit, excuse me, for General Moore award points in the Corps.

07:52.565 --> 07:56.649
Whereas the band was getting academic credit, they were getting an hour of P.E.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.591
credit or something.

07:58.852 --> 08:02.736
But talking about that, the guys voted it down every time we brought it up.

08:03.077 --> 08:08.302
We brought it up probably eight or ten times, do you want to try to get an hour's credit?

08:08.422 --> 08:09.504
And they'd always say no.

08:09.884 --> 08:19.855
They took more pride I think in the fact that they were doing it for the university because the university had given so much to them.

08:21.539 --> 08:34.382
That was probably the major thing and the adjustments we had to make organizationally to cover that, that transition.

08:36.325 --> 08:39.270
And that was gradual, that shift from core to?

08:39.290 --> 08:41.775
Yeah, yeah.

08:41.795 --> 08:43.598
Well, it probably all happened within,

08:45.468 --> 08:47.351
Oh, ten years.

08:47.651 --> 08:50.455
I mean once it started and it kept going.

08:53.740 --> 09:02.953
But the guys who are in the Corps and who are in the Sync Cadets have it really tough because so many times their outfit, the guys in their outfit

09:03.659 --> 09:09.205
give them a hard time, an awfully hard time, because they're not there for their P.E.

09:09.265 --> 09:13.469
program, their sports teams, their outfit teams.

09:14.911 --> 09:22.659
And it takes quite a young man to be in the Corps and be in the St.

09:22.679 --> 09:24.921
Gunnett simultaneously these days.

09:25.321 --> 09:26.523
It used to be, it was routine.

09:29.085 --> 09:30.747
Other changes?

09:31.975 --> 09:34.738
Well, of course, the girls coming.

09:36.400 --> 09:43.769
You know, there was so much static and noise and hassle about that when it first started.

09:43.829 --> 09:49.535
And within a year, I said, man, it's the best thing that ever happened to A&M.

09:50.577 --> 09:57.865
The Aggie spirit went from the bottom of the pit to the top of the pile, almost like overnight.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.460
It was amazing.

09:59.581 --> 10:00.823
And I just thought it was great.

10:01.163 --> 10:02.045
I just thought it was great.

10:02.846 --> 10:09.719
And I'd say that on tour, you know, and I'd get people in the audience go, you know, old eggs.

10:09.999 --> 10:12.203
But they came around too.

10:14.066 --> 10:16.731
Not stupid, not all the time anyway.

10:18.078 --> 10:21.505
That was a major change.

10:23.188 --> 10:24.991
What about their talent, their capability?

10:25.472 --> 10:26.895
Oh, that's lifted.

10:27.576 --> 10:29.099
I mean, that's really gone up.

10:29.580 --> 10:32.526
As I said, in the early days,

10:33.873 --> 10:42.703
Most of the guys were good old country boys, could sing, twang a guitar a little bit, that sort of thing.

10:43.264 --> 10:50.993
But the school systems, see, their music programs have gone uphill so fast and so far.

10:51.894 --> 10:58.902
I mean Texas has probably got the best music program nationally, chorally, band, whatever.

10:59.894 --> 11:02.678
So that was reflected.

11:06.865 --> 11:10.670
Actually it made it much more difficult to do the auditions.

11:11.331 --> 11:16.800
Because you didn't say, gee I can't turn him down, I just can't.

11:18.062 --> 11:28.197
And many times the young man not really knowing about the singing cadets when he auditioned for them.

11:29.324 --> 11:40.340
which didn't recognize that we did a kind of more variety of music and lighter type fare, we'd go and join the Century Singers.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.101
And that was fine.

11:41.441 --> 11:47.210
I mean, because that program needed support too, definitely.

11:48.812 --> 11:52.277
That was a major change, the gals.

11:52.713 --> 12:05.231
As far as you know, when you retired, was there any status difference among the general student body between any of these choral organizations?

12:06.953 --> 12:08.095
How do you mean exactly?

12:08.255 --> 12:14.984
Did the average person out on the student body or on the campus think of one of them as outranking the others?

12:15.986 --> 12:18.990
Oh, well, possibly.

12:19.325 --> 12:35.904
We went through the period of time within vocal music programs where we had a really kind of jealousy battle going on between the Century Singers and the Singedettes.

12:35.924 --> 12:40.910
But that's gone now as far as I know, and was before I left.

12:41.331 --> 12:48.319
And the women's chorus.

12:49.885 --> 12:54.152
had become a kind of female version of the St.

12:54.172 --> 12:58.600
Cadets, doing basically the same format of programming and so forth.

12:59.782 --> 13:01.445
They didn't travel nearly as much.

13:01.806 --> 13:06.394
There's a big difference in the sound of a women's chorus and a men's chorus.

13:07.075 --> 13:12.805
And I'm assuming that all those others would have very few members of the Corps in them also.

13:14.236 --> 13:14.657
Right.

13:14.797 --> 13:15.679
That they'd have the same.

13:16.079 --> 13:16.280
Right.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.165
But the Women's Chorus does have core members.

13:19.726 --> 13:20.868
Century Singers do too.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.871
But not many.

13:24.634 --> 13:26.918
There just isn't enough time, you know.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.328
To go to school, half of them have jobs in addition to going to school.

13:32.949 --> 13:35.113
And activities...

13:35.482 --> 13:40.309
In that 35 years, did the number of concerts and the schedule of the year change much?

13:41.471 --> 13:44.695
Oh yeah, it increased considerably.

13:44.715 --> 13:56.072
I mean we'd get up, as I said, that first year we did probably 17 appearances.

13:57.942 --> 14:06.753
And we'd do, I mean we got to the point where we could do 17 in the first three weeks of school here, you know, later.

14:07.554 --> 14:19.789
But we'd average about 50 performances in town and 50 performances out of town when I retired in 95.

14:20.469 --> 14:24.334
That's about 100 in the total.

14:24.354 --> 14:26.717
That was variable, but that's about right.

14:28.216 --> 14:29.721
And a lot of miles.

14:33.233 --> 14:36.403
And looking back... Scholarship money, too.

14:37.666 --> 14:38.927
You had some scholarship money?

14:38.947 --> 14:45.635
Yeah, I mean, any time the A&M Mother's Club sponsored us, that was for scholarship money for A&M.

14:46.275 --> 14:50.640
So the money that we earned in a performance came right back to A&M.

14:51.782 --> 14:53.624
That was the whole point.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.190
Looking back over those years, you mentioned Fred McClure.

14:59.250 --> 15:03.835
Who are some of your other favorite Sing Cadet members?

15:04.235 --> 15:04.956
Oh, heavens.

15:07.838 --> 15:08.579
Oh God.

15:10.903 --> 15:21.680
Al Meyer, I think he's head of the chemistry department at TU right now.

15:22.301 --> 15:22.942
Al Meyer.

15:23.203 --> 15:23.643
Al Meyer.

15:23.924 --> 15:35.382
He's the one who designed the logo back in the 60s, about 64.

15:36.830 --> 15:41.194
Jim Cain, the one who was in 17 semesters.

15:42.035 --> 15:42.456
T.C.

15:42.476 --> 15:45.058
Cone, who just died about six months ago.

15:46.520 --> 15:50.443
A friend of Jim Cain, same group.

15:52.726 --> 15:53.406
Jim Crouch.

15:58.231 --> 15:58.892
Larry Layton.

16:02.435 --> 16:03.276
Jack Harrington.

16:05.872 --> 16:08.495
President's son.

16:08.515 --> 16:10.176
He's Dr. Harrington now I think.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.979
But we have a reunion every year.

16:13.019 --> 16:21.387
And average 150 to 200 who come back every year.

16:22.288 --> 16:26.712
We always have it on a football weekend so they can go to the game as well.

16:29.074 --> 16:29.935
It's very hard.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.997
I mean I have so many favorites.

16:33.563 --> 16:35.146
for so many different reasons.

16:38.511 --> 16:44.361
Some of our instrumentalists through the years have been particularly outstanding.

16:46.064 --> 16:51.434
I've been very fortunate to have the acquaintance that I've had.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.657
June Behring was with me for 16 years.

16:54.298 --> 16:55.200
Spell her last name.

16:55.636 --> 16:57.379
B-I-E-R-I-N-G.

16:57.779 --> 16:59.202
Gus Buring is her husband.

17:00.443 --> 17:03.468
Of course she's passed on.

17:04.830 --> 17:09.177
We always called him the John Wayne of the Brazzes.

17:09.197 --> 17:15.927
And now of course Condi Carter who is excellent, just excellent.

17:15.947 --> 17:20.935
Charlotte Airey was our accompanist for several years.

17:22.602 --> 17:28.318
Mrs. MacArthur, Margaret MacArthur, was for several years.

17:28.659 --> 17:33.051
She directed the Century Singers or the New Tradition Singers for a year or two also.

17:34.837 --> 17:39.304
We've had excellent help.

17:40.986 --> 17:52.964
And Missy Holloway, who is the administrative assistant in the office, actually she started out as a pure secretary, but she runs the office now.

17:53.004 --> 17:54.607
There's no question about it.

17:55.388 --> 17:59.494
She is something else.

17:59.474 --> 18:27.743
makes the the job so much more pleasant and it's not that job it's a it's a joy all right as you using that very positive um how how did other than proud how else would you describe the way you felt then and now about being the conductor of the group i was

18:29.360 --> 18:32.003
I was always proud of them.

18:33.464 --> 18:36.107
I didn't always like them, the individuals.

18:37.669 --> 18:42.414
But I was always proud of them because they always came through for me and for the university.

18:45.397 --> 18:54.566
I was reading a couple of others last night from various hosts and how they bragged on the boys.

18:54.786 --> 18:57.409
I mean, part of our program was

18:58.013 --> 19:06.043
to be PR oriented, not only on stage, but off stage even more so than on stage.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.046
Make your beds when you get up in the morning.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.490
Clean the bathroom, make it better than it was when you got there.

19:12.271 --> 19:14.915
And you know, this amazes some host mothers.

19:15.516 --> 19:26.029
Mothers especially always send a thank you note immediately after a tour, after you've been in a host's home.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.430
Things like that, that was all part of our program.

19:29.491 --> 19:32.977
That was all part of their growing up business.

19:36.584 --> 19:41.172
Sharing with each other and with your fellow man.

19:44.258 --> 19:49.367
Music was our tool.

19:51.473 --> 19:53.697
Living was our method.

19:53.878 --> 19:58.066
I mean, we taught them how to behave as well as sing.

19:59.569 --> 20:00.972
And they loved doing it.

20:01.393 --> 20:02.254
They loved doing it.

20:03.437 --> 20:13.617
As you look back on those 35 years with sing cadets, can you think of any opportunities that the institution missed?

20:15.875 --> 20:22.644
that would relate to the scene cadets and or the music in general?

20:26.549 --> 20:43.030
Well, there were several occasions where I had the opportunity to get various music composers and publishers

20:44.528 --> 20:49.033
to do special music for A&M.

20:50.654 --> 20:53.057
And that's not cheap.

20:53.077 --> 20:56.080
A&M would never come through with the money to do that.

20:56.540 --> 21:03.307
And do you know to this day, as far as I know, they still don't own the 12th Man.

21:05.489 --> 21:06.891
They own the Aggie War Hymn.

21:07.772 --> 21:09.353
They own the Spirit.

21:10.635 --> 21:13.017
They own I'd Rather Be a Texas Aggie

21:14.363 --> 21:16.787
But they don't own the 12th man.

21:17.047 --> 21:17.488
Who does?

21:18.189 --> 21:20.372
The daughter of the man who wrote it.

21:21.033 --> 21:22.575
And she won't give up the rights.

21:24.318 --> 21:27.423
At least the university won't pay her enough to give up the rights.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.845
What might that sum be?

21:28.865 --> 21:31.789
I have no idea now.

21:32.951 --> 21:40.422
Ten years ago it was like $800.

21:42.950 --> 21:43.591
In the pot.

21:46.073 --> 21:47.954
But they wouldn't come through with it.

21:48.095 --> 21:49.416
I didn't have the money to do it.

21:49.916 --> 21:54.060
Compared to additions to Kyle Field, that's a pretty small sum of money.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.581
Oh, heavens, yeah.

21:55.701 --> 21:57.483
And A&M ought to own that song.

21:58.143 --> 22:02.087
I mean, the man that wrote it wrote it for A&M.

22:02.167 --> 22:02.467
Yes.

22:04.829 --> 22:07.972
But it went into the estate, you see.

22:08.673 --> 22:09.693
And the daughter won't go.

22:10.254 --> 22:12.636
And she's not making any money out of it.

22:15.046 --> 22:16.788
I don't know.

22:17.469 --> 22:17.849
Let's see.

22:17.869 --> 22:20.072
You've mentioned some.

22:20.733 --> 22:24.758
The greatest proud moments for you during these 35 years.

22:30.384 --> 22:34.770
Watching them stand on the steps of the White House and singing the war hymn.

22:35.971 --> 22:45.002
And with President Nixon, may he rest in peace, coming out and shaking every hand of every man.

22:44.982 --> 22:47.284
That was great.

22:48.605 --> 22:57.993
Another time was at commencement when George Bush spoke, and we were singing God Bless the USA.

22:58.033 --> 23:04.779
And I looked over and there he was in the corner of the room singing right along with us.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.762
That was great.

23:08.142 --> 23:14.668
When we got the gold medal in Hawaii, we'd go to these intercollegiate

23:15.425 --> 23:17.728
music judging things.

23:17.768 --> 23:23.095
And the first year we went to Hawaii, and they all took place in Hawaii.

23:24.877 --> 23:33.509
The first year we went, most of the other groups were high school groups that were there.

23:35.551 --> 23:42.060
But we sang and went to the raise, and we did a terrific job.

23:42.901 --> 23:45.364
And all the kids there knew we had won, you know.

23:46.745 --> 23:54.358
And the night they announced that we got the quote, highly coveted silver medallion, second place.

23:55.460 --> 23:59.306
And the other kids there booed.

23:59.466 --> 24:00.468
The judges were terrible.

24:00.788 --> 24:04.214
Anyway, the second time we did that, we got the gold medal.

24:05.336 --> 24:09.563
And I was real proud that day.

24:15.128 --> 24:25.883
I'm always proud when I hear about how some of the kids have gone on and done good things, special things.

24:25.903 --> 24:27.906
I'm always sad when some of them die.

24:28.146 --> 24:33.914
I've had sons of sons in the group.

24:36.597 --> 24:37.419
Cohn, T.C.

24:37.459 --> 24:38.300
Cohn for instance.

24:39.061 --> 24:44.308
His father, his brother, and he or all three have been senior cadets.

24:45.082 --> 24:49.227
And his father's still alive and comes to reunions every year.

24:50.729 --> 24:52.371
TC passed away with cancer.

24:56.856 --> 24:57.737
It's very hard.

24:58.858 --> 25:07.729
I think one of the greatest nights is the night of June's last performance with us, after 16 years.

25:08.930 --> 25:13.215
And one of the saddest times is when she died shortly thereafter.

25:15.288 --> 25:19.440
How did you feel when you finished your last concert?

25:21.246 --> 25:21.988
Very sad.

25:22.750 --> 25:23.412
Very proud.

25:24.395 --> 25:27.424
And I still... I catch myself...

25:28.552 --> 25:33.758
Every afternoon about four o'clock I start mentally getting ready for rehearsal.

25:34.078 --> 25:37.462
And it's so dumb, but I do it anyway.

25:37.502 --> 25:49.355
I'm not singing as much of course as I did, because I'd sing at every rehearsal with them at performances.

25:49.375 --> 25:52.298
I am singing in the church choir.

25:54.623 --> 25:58.469
As I say, we just got through with this show.

25:58.529 --> 25:59.891
That's why I have this long hair.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.434
I've got to get to it Barbara tomorrow morning.

26:09.305 --> 26:11.488
I felt I was very proud.

26:12.449 --> 26:13.711
I was very, very proud.

26:14.472 --> 26:16.896
And I still am.

26:18.558 --> 26:22.504
I think that was a glorious night, just that whole thing.

26:24.560 --> 26:36.873
It always thrilled me to fill Rudder Auditorium on Parents Weekend when I've been to many town hall performances or open performances that weren't full.

26:38.715 --> 26:44.801
That just made it very special to me every year when we'd fill that place, 2,500 seats.

26:46.143 --> 26:50.247
It was great singing in Dallas at the center up there.

26:51.965 --> 27:00.161
But it wasn't, it was not acoustically as good, I don't think, as right around the story.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.067
Jones Hall in Houston was always a good show.

27:03.889 --> 27:07.015
Yeah, there's a minor question.

27:07.396 --> 27:14.209
Of all the places you all sang, which one in terms of the quality of the facility?

27:15.252 --> 27:16.555
Which ones were the best?

27:16.575 --> 27:18.639
I put Rudder Hart and Tony up against any of them.

27:18.799 --> 27:19.120
Really?

27:19.240 --> 27:19.821
Yes, ma'am.

27:20.242 --> 27:20.683
Yes, sir.

27:21.564 --> 27:22.927
I'll tell you, that's another thing.

27:22.947 --> 27:24.650
You asked one of the thrills.

27:25.432 --> 27:32.265
When we went to Hawaii the last time for that contest,

27:34.287 --> 27:51.698
We went to the Arizona Memorial, and we sang, Rise Up, O Men of God, before we went out to the Arizona, in that little, there's a covered area there where you kind of wait for the boat.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.949
And they got off key.

28:00.410 --> 28:08.044
And I said two words, I was singing, I sang two words and we got right back on key and we finished it.

28:09.827 --> 28:13.473
God bless the USA and rise up, O men of God.

28:13.934 --> 28:16.138
And boy, that was thrilling.

28:17.561 --> 28:20.005
Another thrilling time was in.

28:19.985 --> 28:27.372
When we sang in a Greek cathedral, of course they had no pews, no seats.

28:28.333 --> 28:33.758
And we sang right in the middle of the church, under the dome, which was very high.

28:34.579 --> 28:40.144
And we had a 16 second reverberation as we finished the song.

28:40.665 --> 28:43.087
I mean it just rang and rang and rang.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.208
And we couldn't believe it.

28:44.729 --> 28:48.172
We just froze and it still was going on.

28:48.192 --> 28:49.013
It was wonderful.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.219
Hungary was nice too.

28:52.539 --> 28:53.400
We enjoyed Hungary.

28:55.563 --> 28:56.304
Had groupies.

28:58.648 --> 29:03.494
High school girls and boys together would follow us all over the country.

29:05.237 --> 29:16.232
And of course we sang, we were there 10 days and sang probably 15, 16 performances.

29:18.997 --> 29:20.318
Great trip.

29:23.642 --> 29:34.272
What advice would you give to the A&M leadership and to the seeing cadets today about that program?

29:41.039 --> 29:45.443
Well, I would say recognize it.

29:46.823 --> 29:52.773
support it, and let those kids know that they're recognized and supported.

29:52.793 --> 30:02.470
The conversation now about the music department at A&M,

30:03.918 --> 30:10.246
Well the Century Singers right now do get credit, about half of them elected to get credit.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.208
I don't know if all of them do now or not.

30:13.229 --> 30:14.030
That one hour.

30:15.032 --> 30:20.758
Well those kids rehearse every day.

30:22.641 --> 30:26.145
You know it's not like a three hour course.

30:27.020 --> 30:28.782
The revelators don't rehearse that often.

30:29.323 --> 30:36.892
The women's chorus rehearse three hours a week, unless they have special rehearsals.

30:37.333 --> 30:40.016
Cadets rehearse every day, Monday through Friday.

30:41.738 --> 30:50.209
As I told you, the cadets have voted down accepting credit, even though it's been offered.

30:51.758 --> 30:52.680
They voted down.

30:53.601 --> 30:59.932
Century singers, that was one of the jealousy things that came up between the singing cadets and the century singers.

31:00.974 --> 31:08.907
Because the singing cadets couldn't understand why the century singers would accept credit for that.

31:11.722 --> 31:15.768
David is doing a good job.

31:16.349 --> 31:19.894
I think he needs to mellow a little more in what he's doing.

31:20.875 --> 31:30.549
He tends to, being a Baptist choir director for so long, he tends to put too much sacred music in the concert.

31:32.232 --> 31:38.100
Sometimes too heavy music.

31:39.110 --> 31:46.048
He's carrying on the traditional things, nothing like a dame and the school songs and blah, blah, blah.

31:46.990 --> 32:02.244
I had a woman call me the other day, Mrs. White, wanting to know what was the name of that place that you sing about where you all went down and drank your cares away.

32:02.264 --> 32:08.731
I said right away, Ed's out on South Wilburn, but it's not that anymore.

32:08.771 --> 32:12.614
They've changed the words to that and I don't really like that.

32:13.075 --> 32:15.597
We had changed or tried to.

32:15.577 --> 32:17.132
We changed from betting.
