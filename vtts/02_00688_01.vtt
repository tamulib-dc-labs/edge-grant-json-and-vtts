00:01.702 --> 00:14.519
Today is November the 2nd, and I am interviewing 
Dr. Linda Parrish, who was a former student in the

00:01.702 --> 00:14.519
College of Education, is now teaching in the 
Department of Industrial and Vocational. Well,

00:14.840 --> 00:17.263
you probably want to get that down. Okay, give me 
more. I have a split appointment. All right. I'm

00:20.127 --> 00:23.231
67% an educational psychologist. Oh, okay. And 
33%. in industrial, vocational, and technical

00:28.735 --> 00:32.139
education. Okay. Very good. And if you've already 
looked at the questions, they don't have to be in

00:34.121 --> 00:39.346
any particular order. I guess change is the one 
thing that I'm asking everybody about because you

00:39.406 --> 00:47.795
would have perceived it from a different, you 
know, deal when you were a student. And then now as

00:48.196 --> 00:54.102
you teach and you see a lot of the changes, I guess 
that will give me a different type of Well, most of

00:54.368 --> 01:00.821
the things I was focusing on is just as a professor, 
because this is my ninth year here. I remember when

01:02.244 --> 01:14.609
I was hired as a professor that one of the things one 
of my professors said to me was, now, Linda, the

01:02.244 --> 01:14.609
hardest thing you're going to have to get used to is 
to act like a professor instead of a graduate

01:02.244 --> 01:14.609
student here. And I said to him, That's not any 
trouble at all. I've always acted like a

01:17.894 --> 01:21.577
professor, even as a student here. And he laughed 
and he says, you know, as a matter of fact, I think

01:22.538 --> 01:24.940
you have. Did you start under Dean Hubert? Yes. 
Hubert hired me. Sure, sure. Okay, good. Well, go

01:32.328 --> 01:42.077
ahead and tell me something about the ways that you 
have seen the changes and what you have perceived

01:32.328 --> 01:42.077
as being, what has impacted, what kind of things 
impacted change since you left? Well, number one

01:42.547 --> 01:46.074
and two go together. It felt like when I was looking 
at number one, the changes that I would tell you

01:46.094 --> 01:56.375
about are just so intricately woven with the 
people who have made the change, so I'll have to

01:46.094 --> 01:56.375
answer those together. A major change in the 
College of Education has been the arrival of Dean

01:57.377 --> 02:03.930
Corrigan. is a nationally visible figure and I can 
remember having a trip to El Paso planned the day

02:04.366 --> 02:29.614
that he was coming to interview and I called and 
rescheduled my trip because it was so important

02:04.366 --> 02:29.614
for me to meet Dean Corrigan and

02:04.366 --> 02:29.614
there were three wonderful candidates that all 
came in that I was teaching as off-campus course in

02:30.016 --> 02:41.308
El Paso, and I didn't reschedule for anyone else, 
just for Karga, because I felt like whether he got

02:30.016 --> 02:41.308
this job or not, or whether he decided to come and 
offer it or not, He was someone I really wanted to

02:42.031 --> 02:51.980
know and really wanted to meet because I had read so 
much of the things he was doing, particularly as

02:42.031 --> 02:51.980
they related to my field in educating disabled 
students. So it was important for me to meet him. I

02:53.862 --> 03:01.129
never was sorry that I rescheduled to do that 
because it was exciting and he's a very exciting

02:53.862 --> 03:01.129
person. But I remember thinking to myself after he 
left from the interview, I wasn't sure what our

03:01.149 --> 03:11.599
chances were that we would get him here, but even 
though I've loved being at Texas A&M, I thought, my

03:11.900 --> 03:20.029
goodness, if we get Dean Kargan, he's better than 
we deserve. He's just so outstanding that we're

03:20.049 --> 03:26.135
going to really have to work hard. That's what I 
thought. I still, after working for him, think

03:28.337 --> 03:34.023
that he is just absolutely a wonderful dean. He 
gives us national leadership. But my perception

03:36.686 --> 03:39.409
is that the faculty here are wonderful also. And so 
maybe I'd feel like he's just as lucky as we are now.

03:47.627 --> 03:48.728
My attitude is that. I can't imagine why you would 
feel that you was better than you deserve. Why in

03:52.291 --> 03:54.173
the world would you feel that? I don't know. I 
remember thinking that. Perhaps because the

03:56.996 --> 04:00.599
climate was so different. Now, you may not get this 
from a lot of people, but to me, the climate was

04:00.819 --> 04:05.984
extremely different. Okay. Though Dean Hubert 
had a lot of good qualities. His leadership style

04:11.917 --> 04:15.061
was so extremely different. It was what you would 
expect at Texas A&M. It was autocratic. It was

04:19.566 --> 04:21.368
authoritarian. It was all of those things. And as a 
result, although we had some very good people

04:24.372 --> 04:32.461
here, I believe that they weren't reaching their 
potential because they were doing what they were

04:24.372 --> 04:32.461
told to do. With a person like Corrigan coming, 
everyone could do just about anything we had the

04:39.886 --> 04:46.756
courage to dream, and he would support it. It got to 
be a joke where people were saying, try to avoid

04:46.816 --> 04:57.812
Corrigan in the elevator, because if you start up a 
conversation, he'll say, well, I expect you to do

04:46.816 --> 04:57.812
that, or, you know, go right ahead with it. Whereas 
before, there had been, in my estimation, more of,

04:58.132 --> 05:05.543
well, let's go through 14 committees before we 
decide if that's an appropriate research.

05:05.843 --> 05:06.484
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so, to me, that was a dramatic 
difference. And as a result, some people felt more

05:09.962 --> 05:14.929
comfortable with Hubert. Some felt more 
comfortable with Corrigan. And not everybody's

05:17.633 --> 05:19.135
alike. But at least those who are the thinkers and 
the doers and the self-initiators are really...

05:29.347 --> 05:38.039
So that's

05:29.347 --> 05:38.039
more the change? That's to me the major change 
since I've been here. I think other things that

05:43.647 --> 05:54.102
have changed that have affected us is more faculty 
governance.

05:56.024 --> 05:57.126
Faculty have had very little in the history of our 
university to do and say with how things were

05:57.747 --> 06:04.994
going. We teach and we serve and we work with 
students and we conduct research, which of course

06:05.574 --> 06:13.061
are all vital things of our profession. But as far 
as the administration and governance, we haven't

06:13.722 --> 06:19.808
had all that much say until lately. You were 
talking about governance and being a part of

06:20.468 --> 06:25.493
decision. Right. I think the faculty in the last 
four years has gotten a lot more vocal and been

06:26.146 --> 06:33.243
heard. And that's not only because of the College 
of Education's stance in leadership, but also

06:33.564 --> 06:41.743
because the university's change in leadership. 
We had, at the same time, a chancellor and a

06:42.280 --> 06:52.733
president come to this university to be a part of 
the faculty and replace the decision-making.

06:52.754 --> 06:56.278
That is also when we were able to establish the 
Faculty Senate. It's helped a lot. I think it's

06:56.939 --> 06:59.222
given a lot of courage. Now, there's also camps, of 
course, those who choose to be involved and those

06:59.262 --> 07:08.534
who rather the administration do it and say, 
you're paid to make the decisions, you do it, and

06:59.262 --> 07:08.534
leave me alone. That's right. I prefer to have some 
say so in what goes on administratively.

07:17.034 --> 07:17.535
OK, good. That wouldn't have happened in 1978 when 
I was the first assistant. Now, tell me how you

07:20.598 --> 07:27.725
feel, the next question, about the college 
achieving its mission. And was there a change

07:27.765 --> 07:31.909
since you were there in that interim period? Was 
there more or less focus or emphasis on the

07:32.769 --> 07:37.414
teaching or the research or the service? 
Everyone, I think, will tell you at a major

07:37.732 --> 07:47.107
university that we are told you must do an 
outstanding job at teaching. That is a focus. And

07:48.028 --> 07:49.871
you have to serve in committees, et cetera. And you 
have to do research. You have to do all three of

07:51.313 --> 07:52.796
these. The truth of the matter is, when we put up the 
tenure and promotion,

07:58.741 --> 08:06.895
Our research is looked at very heavily, and I'm in 
the Department of Educational Psychology, and we

07:58.741 --> 08:06.895
have some very strong researchers. And to be in 
comparison with that group, you have to be

08:07.536 --> 08:22.082
conducting research, and you cannot be doing 
research that is deemed inappropriate or less...

08:22.653 --> 08:24.977
Who decides whether your research is? Is it your 
department head that decides what research to do?

08:29.003 --> 08:32.087
No, I decide what research I will do. Whether it's 
appropriate or acceptable. Right. The people

08:36.935 --> 08:40.260
ahead of me, I'm an associate professor. My full 
professor colleagues in my department are

08:41.562 --> 08:50.736
currently, as we speak, even this year, looking at 
my credentials. for promotion to full professor.

08:53.461 --> 08:56.445
And so, well, it may be, it may not be. This one's a 
real important one to me because this is what

08:56.525 --> 09:01.112
everybody wants to become is a full professor. But 
the one, I guess, the most crucial is going from

09:01.152 --> 09:09.604
assistant to associate because that's where your 
tenure comes at that point, too. So, and having

09:09.644 --> 09:20.841
already achieved that, I can tell you that had I not 
done a significant amount of research and outside

09:09.644 --> 09:20.841
funded research, which I do a great deal of, I don't 
think I would have looked on as favorably. And

09:25.275 --> 09:26.337
that's my perception. It may not be true, but it is 
my perception of how we are judged. I personally

09:31.749 --> 09:35.858
feel that the most important thing I do is teach. 
And it irritates me. to think that some top-notch

09:40.447 --> 09:48.416
researchers can be lousy teachers and remain at 
Texas A&M. I believe it's easier to be a bad teacher

09:48.436 --> 09:57.727
and a good researcher and stay here than it would be 
to be a wonderful teacher and a mediocre

09:48.436 --> 09:57.727
researcher. That's my perception. That's 
interesting. And because of the time constraints

10:00.491 --> 10:09.441
and because you're doing so many things, all of you 
as professors, do you feel a certain amount of

10:00.491 --> 10:09.441
pressure when you when you don't have some ongoing 
research at all times? I've never not had a funded

10:14.147 --> 10:17.212
research project. Never. I've got six. I've got a 
half a million dollars this year in funded

10:18.835 --> 10:22.803
research. Almost half a million dollars. And I 
have never had... A year that I've been a professor

10:28.253 --> 10:31.957
that I have not had outside funding research. But 
you're also always teaching and you're also

10:32.057 --> 10:35.101
always doing that? This is the first year in nine 
years that I am not teaching. I have always taught

10:38.285 --> 10:41.168
and conducted research. But because of the 
magnitude of the research grants I got this year,

10:41.248 --> 10:53.282
and I have 20 people hired doing research for me 
this year, I am only doing administration and

10:41.248 --> 10:53.282
other work. Oh, absolutely. And so I'm guest 
speaking all the time. I go to people, do you need

10:57.808 --> 11:00.733
somebody to go into your classes with? I know you 
did that in our classes somewhere very well. Well,

11:02.796 --> 11:08.103
I have to do that because that's where you get the 
gratification is from your students. And I

11:08.444 --> 11:12.690
suppose I'm just not cut out to be an 
administrator. I like to touch people more often.

11:15.754 --> 11:15.854
Okay. Well, that's probably part of the next 
question then. How has this tremendous growth

11:20.397 --> 11:21.979
affected your work with students? It's been 
awful. I cannot tell you. From 1978 to 1986, the

11:26.786 --> 11:36.160
largest class I had at A&M was 36 students. Last 
semester, in the spring of 86, I had a class of 183.

11:39.605 --> 11:40.306
Gosh. 183? That's one class. That's right. One 
class. Special Education 110, Introduction to

11:44.552 --> 11:48.818
Special Education. Let me tell you, I'll do 
anything to keep on teaching that class again. I

11:52.864 --> 11:54.526
didn't know the students. People will come up to me 
on campus now and say, oh, Dr. Parrish, I had you

11:54.567 --> 11:59.153
last spring. There's no way you know them. And I 
have had, I mean, I know my students, and I know

12:01.175 --> 12:07.845
where they're from, and I don't want to do that 
every year. But somebody's doing it this

12:08.185 --> 12:11.209
semester. With that many students? Oh, yeah. No, 
240 in that class this semester. It's worse

12:15.375 --> 12:17.898
because we had such a big increase. Mercy. That is. 
So definitely it has affected the ability to work

12:20.280 --> 12:24.744
with students more on an individual basis. In 
those kind of classes. In the counseling type.

12:27.527 --> 12:27.947
Okay. In the overall survey classes. This is a 110. 
It's a freshman, sophomore level class. And I hate

12:34.153 --> 12:35.354
that. Of course, that's going on in chemistry, you 
know, everywhere. But for the first five years I

12:40.159 --> 12:44.503
was here, I only taught graduate classes, and I 
think my biggest one of those was 18th. I love that.

12:47.270 --> 12:52.176
But undergraduates, I think that we need to keep 
our undergraduate classes small. Those kids

12:52.477 --> 12:54.980
really need to know professors. That's where 
you're setting foundations. That's right. Okay.

12:58.765 --> 13:09.439
That leads me then to a little bit about how 
departments and colleges and so forth

12:58.765 --> 13:09.439
collaborate maybe with each other to alleviate 
maybe some of these problems or to enhance or to

12:58.765 --> 13:09.439
whatever. What do you see? there in the 
collaborative efforts? I think we're doing

13:12.810 --> 13:18.460
better than we've done in the past, although we're 
still not as good as we should be. My personal

13:18.560 --> 13:24.089
opinion is, if I had some vision for the future, is 
that we don't have departments at all. We'd have a

13:25.612 --> 13:31.502
college of education, and we would have faculty 
who were interdisciplinary in nature, But you

13:31.769 --> 13:45.085
would have someone, for example, in educational 
administration who could teach without going

13:31.769 --> 13:45.085
into its site what an administrator needs to know 
for disabled students in their mainstream

13:31.769 --> 13:45.085
schools. And I just think that we would have a more 
effective program if we didn't realize

13:45.105 --> 13:56.038
department heads necessarily have to fight for 
resources for their departments. And we have a lot

13:56.018 --> 13:58.261
of that. All these people get along with each 
other, and they meet with policy committee

13:58.281 --> 14:05.892
meetings once a month, I think, within Corrigan, 
and I think they get along. But then they, that's

14:05.912 --> 14:08.696
what they have to do. I mean, that's the nature of 
their job. So there's some of this turf

14:10.479 --> 14:12.682
protection, too. You want to have, you know, your 
area protected, or is that... Oh, absolutely,

14:12.702 --> 14:17.969
absolutely. And... I don't know. Maybe I'm also 
too idealistic to really be an effective

14:20.832 --> 14:40.438
administrator, but it seems to me that if we're all 
doing something very well, then we could

14:20.832 --> 14:40.438
eliminate any excess that we might have, and I 
don't know that we did, and work together in our

14:20.832 --> 14:40.438
students would really benefit. I don't believe 
that we need to be governed by our present order. Do

14:45.205 --> 14:46.326
you think that would ever happen? Dean Corrigan 
did it at a university before he came here. He had

14:51.132 --> 14:55.098
centers of inquiry, as I understand it. I may be 
misrepresenting him, but I had read about what he

14:55.198 --> 15:04.332
did, and I was looking for that kind of thing to 
happen at A&M in the first three years he'd given

14:55.198 --> 15:04.332
up. Did he try? I mean, I know he set up some inquiry 
groups. He set up inquiry groups, and I thought,

15:07.137 --> 15:13.587
aha, this is the first step, because he sent out 
wanting to know all of our interests. And then we

15:13.667 --> 15:23.063
got together in centers of inquiry, inquiry 
groups, and those have been fun, but they haven't

15:13.667 --> 15:23.063
led to the demise of departments. Well, and there 
was also, I understand, some resistance on some

15:23.143 --> 15:30.555
departments' part of not even to the point I have 
heard of punishing the faculty members who got too

15:30.890 --> 15:34.554
involved in the inquiry groups. Whereas in other 
departments, everybody was on all of them, or

15:34.614 --> 15:38.559
there was somebody on all sides. That's right. And 
I got to be involved from the very beginning,

15:38.939 --> 15:42.583
because I thought it was exciting and new. Well, we 
got to meet different faculty. Believe this or

15:45.266 --> 15:51.093
not, there were faculty in the College of 
Education in different departments that really

15:45.266 --> 15:51.093
don't know each other very well. I have heard that 
also from several teachers, that because it has

15:51.113 --> 15:59.783
grown so fast, now people don't know each other or 
have the camaraderie that they enjoyed when it was

15:51.113 --> 15:59.783
just a very small group. But we could. There are 
ways to do it, even in big conglomerations. Very

16:06.580 --> 16:07.081
good. And do you see that all of these things have 
changed how other people see us as a college of

16:07.723 --> 16:15.477
education on a state level or even beyond? You 
know, through your exposure. That's very

16:17.216 --> 16:17.857
interesting. I should go back to number five to 
say, we talked about inside the college. Outside

16:22.204 --> 16:35.804
the college, just recently, we're beginning to 
work with the College of Science and the College of

16:22.204 --> 16:35.804
Liberal Arts to work on degree plans that reflect 
what the state is looking at, less teacher-ed kind

16:22.204 --> 16:35.804
of courses, those kind of things. Those things 
should always be there, because whether we like it

16:35.824 --> 16:44.738
or not, in any major university, the College of 
Education is looked on as the ugly stepsister. I

16:45.292 --> 16:54.482
have been told to my face that you were the weak link 
in this very strong chain, meaning the entire

16:45.292 --> 16:54.482
College of Education. At A&M, you mean? Oh, yes. 
You have been told? Yes, at A&M was where I was told

16:57.645 --> 17:02.890
by a department head in the College of Liberal 
Arts. It is amazing to me if people don't

17:04.732 --> 17:14.843
understand it or if they just reject hearing it, if 
they don't know that, because that's the

17:04.732 --> 17:14.843
perception of the College of Education. Maybe not 
so much here as all over the country, but it

17:15.076 --> 17:19.320
certainly is. It's just a national phenomenon. 
Now, with Dean Corrigan's coming and with his high

17:23.485 --> 17:35.698
visibility and his articulate nature and all of 
those types of things, we have been able to turn the

17:23.485 --> 17:35.698
corner at A&M. I believe most of our higher ed 
administrators believe we're the best college. I

17:41.124 --> 17:41.884
believe that. I think they'll shakily believe 
that. But I don't know if our colleagues in liberal

17:44.135 --> 17:50.924
arts and science and those people believe that. 
You still have that respect for that, right?

17:54.148 --> 17:55.710
That's interesting. You have to understand, I'm 
married to the Associate Dean of Liberal Arts, so I

17:55.730 --> 18:06.044
party a lot with people in the foreign languages 
and literature. And there's this air, maybe,

18:06.284 --> 18:08.607
of... There is. There definitely is that 
superiority here, but it's really hysterical

18:09.646 --> 18:20.516
because we tend to be flourishing, and the College 
of Education gets resources, and somebody

18:09.646 --> 18:20.516
flourishes. Well, and isn't this college and the 
College of Liberal Arts the two fastest growing? I

18:24.680 --> 18:26.902
believe that's what we heard at the last 
development council. And business. And

18:27.623 --> 18:28.684
business, okay. So that's an interesting thing. 
And, of course, well, to skip around a little bit,

18:35.890 --> 18:44.821
What do you think then now with all these 
perspective changes and these things in the

18:35.890 --> 18:44.821
legislature and all the interpretation of these 
new bills, how do you think that's going to affect?

18:45.262 --> 18:46.223
It's going to help us. Okay. Now a lot of people will 
say, oh my gosh, look, it's changing what we've

18:47.505 --> 18:53.212
done in the last 195 years. To me, it's wonderful. 
It's going to raise the esteem of teachers. going

18:58.402 --> 19:01.607
to raise their position in the schools. They're 
going to, in my estimation, be rewarded

19:01.967 --> 19:07.855
financially if they come out believing they are 
better. Now, whether they're better or not, I'm

19:08.276 --> 19:10.539
not saying. But the perception of them being 
better by not graduating, say, with 90 hours of

19:11.501 --> 19:21.895
education, which they don't, but everybody 
believes they do. That's true. then they're going

19:23.596 --> 19:25.358
to come out. It's all perception. But that's okay. 
If it is perception, it is a good thing for them. The

19:32.486 --> 19:37.151
thing of it is, the kids that come here to A&M are 
good students. And people will say to me, ah, you

19:37.871 --> 19:43.738
know, A&M, you must have a wonderful college 
education. Your students don't fail the exit

19:43.758 --> 19:46.701
test. Okay, you've got 98% passing the exit test. 
My answer to them is yes, I think we are good at A&M.

19:54.149 --> 19:59.358
But I'm telling you that the kids who come to A&M 
could probably pass the exit test the day they

19:54.149 --> 19:59.358
arrive. We get the cream of the crop to come to A&M. 
So I can't take all the responsibility and the

20:02.383 --> 20:08.554
credit for making these wonderful teachers. 
They're wonderful students when they come to us.

20:11.536 --> 20:19.346
Okay, that's something that I keep hearing now 
from people about because we have had to raise the

20:11.536 --> 20:19.346
standards and because of the enrollment cap and 
because all of these other things that are

20:11.536 --> 20:19.346
happening. I'm hearing, you know, are you leaving 
out, you know, your average students? And are the

20:23.611 --> 20:32.502
people that are coming that are so fantastic, that 
are merit scholars, that are, you know, the cream

20:23.611 --> 20:32.502
of the crop, how many of those want to go into 
teaching? Very few. very few, but

20:33.728 --> 20:40.063
you can't blame them. If I were going back to school 
today with the opportunities different than they

20:40.564 --> 20:52.311
were 25 years ago, I probably wouldn't major in 
education, but we've got to make education as as

20:52.865 --> 20:55.329
competitive. So what's going to do it? Well, 
what's going to do it is raising our self-esteem.

20:58.553 --> 21:04.342
And if that means getting a degree in liberal arts 
with a teaching certificate, I don't really care

20:58.553 --> 21:04.342
how we do it. Just so we make these students 
competent professionals who believe in

21:04.762 --> 21:09.789
themselves. And so I think all of these things, I'm 
willing to try them because we're not succeeding

21:09.809 --> 21:17.040
for our teachers now. So we've got to change. And 
the universities better not send them away. We

21:21.108 --> 21:23.851
better leave the fight. Why am I here? I'm here 
because I was a teacher for 10 years in the public

21:25.272 --> 21:28.235
schools. And I couldn't make decisions. I 
couldn't make changes. And I didn't make enough

21:31.618 --> 21:34.500
money. Right? Okay. So everybody didn't have the 
opportunity. I had to go back and get a doctorate.

21:40.986 --> 21:42.728
We've got to make it work. That's true. That's a 
totally different perception. And I'm glad to

21:45.010 --> 21:46.311
hear it because Well, I'm strange. I told you I am. 
That's great. At least it's different. Well,

21:52.561 --> 22:03.216
you've been here, I guess, the least time of 
anybody that I have talked to, and I think that

21:52.561 --> 22:03.216
probably gives you that different perspective 
that you haven't been here for 30 years or 20 years.

22:03.417 --> 22:10.007
Well, I hope when I have been here for 30 years that I 
am willing to say, let's do something different.

22:10.027 --> 22:10.928
Let's try it. Let's be innovative. If it doesn't 
work, let's say, well, we made a mistake, but we're

22:11.969 --> 22:15.775
not going to. kill anybody going through here in 
the process. There's degrees of quality.

22:21.049 --> 22:21.350
Absolutely. Okay, so now, with or without your 
little crystal ball, can you tell me a little bit

22:21.830 --> 22:38.270
about, and you have already in passing talked 
about maybe some of your visions for the future,

22:21.830 --> 22:38.270
one being no departments, which would be 
certainly an innovative program. What other

22:38.310 --> 22:43.416
things do you think the College of Education might 
be looking at in the 21st century? Well, the

22:43.632 --> 22:49.691
College of Education, you haven't really asked 
any negative questions here, but I want to tell you

22:43.632 --> 22:49.691
something. Okay. I looked at this and I thought, 
how am I going to get in somewhere? Because I can

22:54.163 --> 22:57.608
talk about wonderful stuff out my ears at A&M. But 
there are some lovingly critical things I need to

22:57.668 --> 23:02.754
say, too. And I say that adjective because I'm not 
angry at A&M. I am delighted to be able to work here.

23:09.964 --> 23:14.210
And sometimes I'm amazed I'm paid to do something I 
love to do in a place I love to do it. But A&M has got

23:14.690 --> 23:19.056
to... have some role models for all of the women who 
are coming through this school. We have one

23:25.581 --> 23:32.632
department head who is a woman in the entire 
university in sociology. We used to have a woman in

23:32.652 --> 23:37.500
modern languages, but she's no longer there. And 
we have had a woman in medicine, Joyce Davis. I'm

23:41.868 --> 23:45.291
not really sure about her, if she's still there or 
not. So there may be two. But for sure, I know

23:46.532 --> 23:50.455
there's one, Mary's I. Farrell in sociology. Now, 
we have had a woman in the College of Liberal Arts as

23:50.475 --> 23:57.621
an assistant dean. But I'm telling you, if the 
College of Education does not show that there can

24:00.123 --> 24:08.010
be women in leadership positions, then we're 
doing a disservice to not only the women, but the

24:08.362 --> 24:16.714
men of this university. And you've already heard 
me say that I don't like administration, so I'm not

24:16.734 --> 24:21.861
trying to make a role for myself here. I am trying to 
make a role for talented women here that are

24:22.642 --> 24:37.002
generally known as the tremendous teachers at 
Texas A&M, the wonderful counselors for the

24:22.642 --> 24:37.002
students, the great service providers. but not 
the decision makers. And if we don't change that,

24:41.546 --> 24:44.770
then we're going to be far behind. Where do those 
changes, I mean, let's talk about decision making

24:44.790 --> 24:53.221
and the hierarchy and how all of those things can 
come about, because I'm not familiar. Being from

24:53.261 --> 24:58.969
the outside, looking in, I am not able to perceive 
the things. Think about all the development

24:58.989 --> 25:02.854
council meetings that you have attended. how many 
women do you see getting up to say, let me tell you

25:03.560 --> 25:08.825
about my department, let me tell you about... They 
win teaching awards because they deserve them,

25:08.845 --> 25:17.874
but they are not the people who are in those 
decision-making roles. I really thought Dean

25:18.174 --> 25:22.118
Cardin would change that, that he has now. Is he 
getting any pressure to change that? Or has he

25:24.100 --> 25:24.781
gotten... The entire university is getting some 
pressure to look at how women are treated. This

25:30.646 --> 25:33.229
year, we were looked at... on a case-by-case basis 
to make sure that we were getting salary

25:33.445 --> 25:37.669
increases. Because we've done a study, I say we, 
I'm on the committee for the status of women at this

25:38.609 --> 25:49.418
university, and I wrote the first report to the 
president two years ago on what the status of women

25:38.609 --> 25:49.418
is here. And we know that across the board we make 
90% of our male colleagues, which is excellent,

25:49.438 --> 26:01.609
because nationwide we're making 54 to 60%. Of 
what, the males? Mm-hmm. And so A&M is really good

26:03.652 --> 26:08.337
at paying us 90% of what our male colleagues do. But 
I can say that facetiously because, you know, why

26:09.218 --> 26:13.222
don't we get the same amount? So this year, case by 
case, the deans looked at all women and all

26:13.242 --> 26:26.335
minority faculty members, and there was 
allocated money to make sure that we got

26:13.242 --> 26:26.335
appropriate raises so that we were not kept. Now, 
again, I work for this, but I am not one of the people

26:26.355 --> 26:32.882
who have been mistreated. I couldn't ever 
complain about my salary increases, ever. But

26:38.924 --> 26:44.012
looking at case by case, we see that some women can 
across the university. Even with a salary

26:44.112 --> 26:50.462
increase, what you're saying is that there's 
still a need to give more roles, for example, like

26:44.112 --> 26:50.462
department heads? Absolutely. College of 
Education desperately needs department heads

26:51.805 --> 26:56.352
and associate and assistant deans. If we can't do 
it, Nobody else in this whole university can.

27:00.771 --> 27:02.193
Liberal arts can. They have. The one department 
head and the former associate dean. Do you have

27:07.761 --> 27:10.966
some of those reports, maybe copies of some of the 
reports on the women? Because that might be

27:10.986 --> 27:14.591
something that I could use as a document. Because 
I'll be looking not only at the College of

27:14.691 --> 27:17.635
Education, but in relationship to its external 
environment, the university, and even beyond the

27:17.902 --> 27:23.267
university. So if you have something... I can get 
some of that sent to you. I can get them from the

27:26.149 --> 27:27.591
faculty senate office. Okay. Any kind of 
documents that would sort of help me to put this in

27:27.971 --> 27:33.195
the right perspective. You'll have to 
understand, though, for your report, that the

27:33.716 --> 27:40.742
documents will deal on women's faculty in the 
university, not in the college of ed. That's fine.

27:41.022 --> 27:41.383
That's fine. Just, again, because I'm not going to 
be just looking at the college of ed. I'll be

27:44.645 --> 27:46.407
putting it in the context of what was happening in 
the university as well. Because that obviously

27:49.178 --> 27:53.165
has influence on what, you know, what happens in 
the college. Absolutely. Okay, good. Now, can we

27:55.129 --> 27:59.437
talk just for a couple of minutes about some of the 
highlights maybe? Hold it just a second. Let me

28:02.602 --> 28:03.484
change the...
