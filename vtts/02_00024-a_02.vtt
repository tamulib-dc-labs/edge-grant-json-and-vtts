00:00:02.309 --> 00:00:08.978
General Simpson, why is it that you believe that a woman somehow cannot march as well as a man?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:21.856
And that wonderful old man said in his, oh, he said, listen, you have not heard me say that a woman can't march as well as a man.

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:26.322
In my opinion, they can march a hell of a lot better.

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:30.628
He said, I don't know why it is, but if you get a woman's outfit competing

00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:38.197
against a bunch of guys in marching, they'll win every time.

00:00:38.217 --> 00:00:38.698
Bingo.

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:45.924
I mean, the Justice Department was astounded at that straightforward answer.

00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:50.469
They then asked, you know, these people are not in the same room at the same time.

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.450
Then they asked Colonel Haney.

00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:59.637
Colonel Haney, why is it that you believe that women in your band would somehow...

00:00:59.903 --> 00:01:03.747
mess them up or destroy their ability to do what they do.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.152
Joe Tom says, look, hold on, King's X.

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:19.864
You've got to understand, I was a public school bandmaster for a lot of years before I got here and wear this uniform.

00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:22.287
I said, I know girls can march in a band.

00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:22.807
Don't, don't.

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:26.731
You've got me pegged wrong if you think.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.134
But there are other issues.

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:42.081
And the other issues had to do with the, from an administrative standpoint, there were legitimate issues associated with where are you going to house them.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.665
We had women dispersed.

00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:46.248
Well, we did not.

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:47.029
We had women.

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:52.979
The Justice Department wanted us to disperse the women and integrate every outfit.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.543
And we knew that there was a,

00:01:56.047 --> 00:02:20.788
if the girls were going to be successful in the corps at all and we had women in the corps that they had to have some psychological base i mean you had to have you know a half dozen or eight or ten people in that unit in order for one or two or three to succeed that was one principle that we were wrestling over and so we did not want to

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:23.101
have women living with the band.

00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:26.446
The band is an outfit, as you know, a military outfit.

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:33.878
So where they resided and where they'd fall out and what unit they'd be a part of was one of the major hang-ups.

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:49.982
Old True, Dr. Miller and General Simpson and all the commandant were far more amenable and willing

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:55.830
for things to move in the direction that the Justice Department wanted them to move.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.754
But Melanie did not play an instrument.

00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:02.235
She wasn't wanting to be in the band.

00:03:02.856 --> 00:03:08.601
Melanie had applied for a position in the Ross Volunteers.

00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:12.244
And there were two positions open.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:18.990
I mean, we just walked into a rolling ball of butchering eyes on that deal because we

00:03:19.662 --> 00:03:27.795
All of a sudden, she was rejected, and it was pretty clear that it was a sex-biased rejection.

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:46.446
And so she had a very good lawsuit, and what began as one grievance became a lawsuit going across the whole Corps makeup from Rudder Rangers to the band.

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:52.203
Now, hadn't she earlier applied to be on the fish drill team?

00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:55.027
I believe that's true.

00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:58.251
Either she had or there were examples of others who had.

00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:05.722
And so there had been some exclusionary practice that had occurred.

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:14.374
And, you know, when you have done that, it gets to be pretty hard to run from facts, doesn't it?

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:23.971
When you get into a lawsuit mode and you've got people deposed under oath, it was not a winnable lawsuit.

00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:24.191
All right.

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.355
And when was the suit concluded?

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:26.976
Do you remember?

00:04:27.857 --> 00:04:28.558
Well, I don't.

00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:40.277
I know it got appealed all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and I can't remember the date.

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:45.288
but many years after she was flying a jet in the Air Force.

00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:50.513
All right, let me, were you by chance present the day she graduated?

00:04:50.753 --> 00:04:51.674
I was not.

00:04:51.694 --> 00:04:56.059
All right, let me add to this tape a personal experience.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:01.765
This is the last of our three spring commencements in May of 1980.

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:08.492
I was dean of faculties, and in those days my job was to carry the mace

00:05:09.063 --> 00:05:13.053
put it in its stand and then I would normally go to the back row on the stage.

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:18.988
Sometimes I carried a paperback book inside my commencement program and I would

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:25.419
read the paperback while I was sitting there through three hours of degrees being passed out.

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.763
On that day I didn't, our speaker was Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby.

00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:39.415
And after his speech and the other introductory formalities, they're giving out the diplomas, and he motions for me to come up and sit next to him to chat.

00:05:40.677 --> 00:05:46.343
And I had already been selected as the president at the University of Texas at El Paso.

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:49.462
planning to go out there about the first of July.

00:05:49.502 --> 00:05:51.588
And this is early May.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.820
And he said, we've been friends for 20 years or so.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.006
And when you get out there, stay in touch.

00:05:58.447 --> 00:06:02.037
Maybe I can help with a special item every now and then.

00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:24.919
So forth we're chatting and I'm feeling very thrilled at his interest and I began to realize we're about through with passing out all the diplomas and I'm about to go back to my seat in the back row and suddenly I hear and notice some hissing by members of the graduating class, particularly corps members.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:33.668
And I glance around and notice to my right that a person is about to come up on the stage to get her diploma.

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:36.632
And I said, oh, my goodness, it's Melanie Zentgraf.

00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:42.039
And Lieutenant Governor Hobby said, oh, my goodness, she's been a pain in my back.

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:43.221
She's been over there.

00:06:43.922 --> 00:06:48.588
She has written me letters and phone calls and this and that.

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:49.529
Gee, my knee.

00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:51.852
It...

00:06:51.832 --> 00:07:01.836
By sheer, sheer unplanned accident, she was the last degree recipient of the last of three commencements.

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.500
And I've always assumed.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.144
Of course, Z would make her last.

00:07:05.164 --> 00:07:05.444
Right.

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:09.975
But I've assumed that her family probably thought we deliberately did that.

00:07:10.647 --> 00:07:28.183
The way it came about, the colleges graduate by alphabetical order, and her undergraduate degree was in medical science, pre-medical science, whatever it was called, and that was administered within the College of Veterinary Medicine.

00:07:28.788 --> 00:07:31.092
That's the last of the schools alphabetically.

00:07:31.573 --> 00:07:33.055
Her name began with a Z.

00:07:33.797 --> 00:07:38.825
So she's the last person in the last major in the last college.

00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:48.903
And she comes up, and Dr. Miller, President Miller, is standing about three feet from where I was seated.

00:07:50.305 --> 00:07:52.028
And...

00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:57.013
By this time, everyone in the auditorium is looking because it's the last degree recipient.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:08.044
There's some hissing, and they are looking, and he hands her her diploma, and she takes it in her right hand instead of normally her left.

00:08:08.485 --> 00:08:20.277
She then shifts it to her left hand and puts out her right hand, and he says to her, as I recall comparatively softly, no way I'm going to shake your hand.

00:08:20.257 --> 00:08:30.871
A number of people within eyesight of what happened kind of gasped and took a deep breath and kind of elbowed the person next to them.

00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:43.868
She then turned to Bob Lacey, the admissions director who was a registrar who was handing the diplomas to Dr. Miller, and put her hand out to him, and he said, ma'am, I'm not involved in this argument.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:50.355
She then looked around, and Don Carter, the director of admissions, said, ma'am, would you keep the line moving?

00:08:51.176 --> 00:09:04.355
She went on off the stage, and when we got to the letterman's lounge, where we all would take off our caps and gowns, I remember a number of regents saying, damn right, serves her right.

00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:06.298
I wouldn't shake hands with her either.

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:07.780
That was a bunch of trouble.

00:09:09.228 --> 00:09:30.836
I understand that about six, eight weeks later, that when the board terminated Dr. Miller and told him of their decision, that by word of mouth, the first item they said to him was you refused to shake hands with an A&M graduate.

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:32.438
I can't vouch for that.

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:33.679
No, I can't either.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.782
I wasn't in that room that day.

00:09:36.783 --> 00:09:38.205
I know what was happening there.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:45.339
prior to his dismissal, and it had nothing to do with that.

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:45.759
Oh, I know that.

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:49.945
But indeed, they may have pitched that out along with everything else.

00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:51.407
And that was just as I understand it.

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:55.052
Now, the Zentgraf case went on years?

00:09:55.312 --> 00:09:56.994
Oh, yes.

00:09:57.915 --> 00:09:58.877
Four, five, six years.

00:09:59.177 --> 00:10:03.342
And did we agree to comply?

00:10:03.383 --> 00:10:07.568
There was a decision handed down.

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:09.164
Yes, sir.

00:10:09.365 --> 00:10:16.295
And, you know, I left in 1984 and was out until mid-86.

00:10:16.555 --> 00:10:16.936
Okay.

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:26.109
And during that period is when the matter finally got ultimately and finally healed and resolved.

00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:33.319
And, you know, it had the result of placing the university in a,

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:39.994
in a compulsory situation with respect to how it treated women in the Corps.

00:10:40.896 --> 00:10:44.484
I'm not sure that it differed largely from what we were willing to do.

00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:47.651
It's just sometimes you'd rather fight than be told.

00:10:49.075 --> 00:10:50.498
And that was one of those cases.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:11:12.081
I had a similar kind of agitator student when I got to the University of Texas at El Paso and my first four or five years there and unknown to me at commencement he had stationed photographers and reporters in the audience because he thought that I wouldn't shake his hand.

00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:15.427
When I heard his name called out, I waved my hands.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:16.429
I applauded.

00:11:16.449 --> 00:11:18.332
I walked over to him.

00:11:18.472 --> 00:11:19.715
I said, mi amigo.

00:11:19.755 --> 00:11:22.880
And he said, I wondered if you would shake my hands.

00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:26.527
And I told him, I said, I am so delighted you are graduating.

00:11:26.888 --> 00:11:29.412
I can't wait for you to walk across this stage.

00:11:29.392 --> 00:11:52.851
and he laughed and we got our pick yeah and it went splendidly all right in those uh you said you the 76 to 84 period what were some other significant legal matters that you had to deal with the gay student services organization was one that emerged as a

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:58.243
organization on campus seeking to be recognized as a student organization.

00:11:59.224 --> 00:12:05.993
And they were not permitted to do so and a lawsuit ensued.

00:12:06.013 --> 00:12:21.673
And again, you could look at the case law in America and know that we were in some difficult position in the federal courts

00:12:22.244 --> 00:12:41.232
even though we had state statutes that made the activity unlawful, the issue that jumps up in front of the activity is the right of assembly and the right to free speech.

00:12:41.873 --> 00:12:49.804
And so those equal protection of the law in the 14th Amendment and all those issues were very real constitutional issues.

00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:55.762
And there have been cases in Missouri and cases in New Hampshire, as I recall.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:13:05.353
And I remember counting the votes of the judges, although both of those cases had prevailed against the universities.

00:13:07.175 --> 00:13:10.058
You know, it was two to one here and three to two there.

00:13:10.518 --> 00:13:14.323
And I was counting all the judges votes and I had a tie.

00:13:14.343 --> 00:13:17.226
That's the best I could come up with.

00:13:18.623 --> 00:13:25.552
One of those cases, Ross Sterling was the U.S. District Judge in the Southern District in Houston.

00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:45.518
And he, in a one-sentence ruling, just almost arbitrarily ruled against their case and gave us a trial court victory, which instantly put us in the Fifth Circuit deal.

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:48.141
And sooner or later,

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:52.965
When you get help like that, all it does is cost you a lot of money.

00:13:52.985 --> 00:14:04.395
Because the case came back and had to be tried, and then was tried, and went all the way back to be a circuit on our account then.

00:14:04.415 --> 00:14:07.137
And we took it also.

00:14:07.157 --> 00:14:11.321
We at least filed a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.

00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:16.165
There is a record of that in the Supreme Court Journal.

00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:18.567
So again, that case...

00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:23.900
took an enormous amount of energy and time.

00:14:24.481 --> 00:14:32.032
So it was a thief of time and legal energy and administrative energy.

00:14:32.052 --> 00:14:34.275
But a matter of principle.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:44.811
We've perceived that principle as long as the women in the family event they prevail.

00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:49.718
It's almost like an issue expired because the truth of the matter is

00:14:50.002 --> 00:15:02.379
The numbers were so slight that it was almost a cause that didn't have any likelihood of ever measuring much.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.667
And that's kind of the case.

00:15:08.488 --> 00:15:15.638
I don't think the whole issue of homosexuality or gay student organization has ever risen to hardly be a problem.

00:15:17.288 --> 00:15:43.043
which of the major cases you dealt with attracted your greatest zeal that you were most interested in in pursuing

00:15:46.921 --> 00:16:12.473
Was there one that you...

00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:38.022
When you started and when you completed, what were the major issues then and

00:16:38.913 --> 00:16:43.818
And then at the end, how did things change in those two decades?

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:46.240
What changed?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.383
And they changed almost immediately.

00:16:49.403 --> 00:16:56.770
And you almost take on the role of having been a catalyst for change.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:07.300
But what I saw change rapidly, and I think considerably more than before, is

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:30.351
What I consider to be a immobilization on the part of the administrator, fearful of the lawsuit, and that it almost put people in a position where they would not make good sense of practical judgment.

00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:43.481
that would, in many cases, have moved the matter to the sidelines or gotten you on past it.

00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:50.850
The law and lawsuits seem to have a punitive effect on academicians.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:56.878
For example, we used to have just a hard-nosed position arising out of some

00:17:57.466 --> 00:18:25.431
Some fear, and Dr. Calhoun and others I'll think of in a minute, were so fearful that if you gave a person another year or two of just a teaching assignment, that somehow that was going to invest in them

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:28.361
the fact that we could never get through.

00:18:28.421 --> 00:18:37.510
Well, there was some room for that fear, but there were some cases that gave you the fear.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.435
Matt Preston, if you will, had just a hard position on that.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:53.545
And I used to argue that any lawyer worth his time, dealing with a faculty member who was genuine in what they were wanting to do, couldn't.

00:18:54.352 --> 00:19:11.774
fashion and agreement that would be binding, that would not be something that they could set aside, that would not be anything that they could ignore, and it would completely wipe out the fear of the faculty movement.

00:19:11.794 --> 00:19:16.680
The example of Mary Kay King, I think, as a math instructor, life of a faculty member.

00:19:17.943 --> 00:19:46.853
which the rest of them didn't want to teach from

00:19:47.137 --> 00:20:05.203
care if she was a lecturer or whether she was an assistant professor or what she did to teach math.

00:20:05.223 --> 00:20:14.376
And I used to argue with Matt and Dr. Hume that there are some basic principles that teach in math and English and semi-structure and some of those what I call service courses and all these things.

00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:27.569
But I just didn't see why any person who was doing it had to also be a researcher and be able to publish something.

00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:32.557
And I understood their argument, of course, for that.

00:20:32.577 --> 00:20:41.730
If you only have so many slots and so much money in a department, you want as big of people and as high-fiving people as you can get rid of.

00:20:42.098 --> 00:20:47.345
to bring the reputation of the department.

00:20:47.365 --> 00:21:07.633
But I still maintain there are service schools in any university of whatever stature that need to be taught by people that are good at what they do and that there is room in the academy for people to enter into certain kinds of contracts and be good at what they're good at and at what they're good at.

00:21:08.373 --> 00:21:13.658
I'm preaching to a guy that's been a president who probably has a completely different view from me.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:14.059
No.

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:20.325
But I will say to you that's one of the strange things about the academy that I'm able to explain.

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:21.567
No, I agree with you entirely.

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:28.954
Now, I'm going to tell you also that I have a strong belief system.

00:21:28.974 --> 00:21:32.598
The opinion system is hugely important.

00:21:32.738 --> 00:21:34.600
And it ought to be guarded and protected.

00:21:34.748 --> 00:21:54.967
in this business of academic freedom gives a huge importance for the faculty member who is being asked to take plans out of high school and take them to a higher level and let them escape.

00:21:54.987 --> 00:21:57.249
And if you don't do it, I've borne witness.

00:21:57.269 --> 00:22:04.215
I've stood in that board of regents through, and I have heard regents come there all turned out of shape for some political science professor

00:22:04.567 --> 00:22:20.070
that didn't have Bill Moore there the same day they had Kent Kaepernick speak to them at a political conference.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.131
And they were ready to fire them.

00:22:21.152 --> 00:22:27.120
Doesn't this mean we're going to have to know who writes these checks?

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:33.049
And so I would stand and regardless of looking at me and asking for help, I'd stand up and say, folks, what we're dealing with is the picture-perfect example of academic freedom.

00:22:33.069 --> 00:22:34.371
There's no case that I've ever known of any clearer

00:22:34.773 --> 00:22:40.081
If you're going to beat up on this guy, you're beating up on everyone else.

00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:41.643
Number one, he's going to beat you.

00:22:41.663 --> 00:22:46.570
Number two, you're beating on the thing that ought to be protected in the deal.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.314
Well, that wasn't the point of it.

00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:57.085
But I'm just here to tell you that I've been close enough to the subject to know that if you throw away protection, the fact of it,

00:22:58.145 --> 00:23:26.093
Now I'm assuming that early on, some of the key cases involved land, property, and gradually the shift was more to individual rights.

00:23:26.377 --> 00:23:29.721
And those grievances arose out of all this.

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:40.773
It didn't disappoint anybody, whether it got to anywhere, whether it got dragged through, whether it was kept, whether it was detained or dropped, given a raise or... And civil rights.

00:23:41.173 --> 00:23:43.596
Civil rights came along.

00:23:43.616 --> 00:23:55.489
And one of the things that I was always against was making sexual preference more of an enumerated item in the...

00:23:55.756 --> 00:24:02.685
of oppression against discrimination.

00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:14.980
Of course, I did not want to be discriminated against on the basis of sexual preference, but it seemed hugely dangerous to me to add an element that the law had not carved out as a potential principle.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.350
The reason is that we would probably have good and valuable reasons for not retaining

00:24:23.465 --> 00:24:27.552
a non-tenured person who's on tenure terms.

00:24:27.572 --> 00:24:32.800
And we would never know if the person was a homosexual or not.

00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:35.204
But guess what?

00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:47.023
If they were, the minute you didn't grant tenure for a perfectly legitimate reason, you're just in the suit.

00:24:47.043 --> 00:24:49.607
And why would you want to be in the suit when nobody is granted or not granted tenure based on their

00:24:53.232 --> 00:25:00.580
habits or patterns, nor do I believe they ought to be disabled.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.782
Of the homosexual being.

00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:09.289
But we all keep sexual activity and sex out of it.

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:18.019
But why build for ourselves another haven for disappointed people to jump in and close themselves with?

00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:21.282
And there are cases on the books where they're really like that.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.523
Now, let's go back chronologically now.

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:34.094
Dr. Williams, they recreate the system the board does, 76, 77.

00:25:34.354 --> 00:25:39.661
Dr. Williams is moved upstairs no longer.

00:25:40.061 --> 00:25:44.046
The chancellor, Jarvis Miller, becomes the president.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.588
You still were at the system level reporting to Clyde Freeman.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:55.117
In that same activity, I was made vice chancellor.

00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:55.618
Oh, okay.

00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:58.282
And was made the report to Dr. Wilson.

00:25:58.442 --> 00:25:58.863
Oh, okay.

00:25:58.883 --> 00:26:04.132
And I was able to step out of that into a role of my own.

00:26:04.773 --> 00:26:10.843
Did the nature of the task that you held change in the late 70s with that?

00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:28.804
And they changed because I was accountable to all the parts and to the entities that they were committed to.

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:33.829
It's still that way today.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.835
And it became a matter of substantial dialogue in some

00:26:40.237 --> 00:26:44.041
some stress and tension.

00:26:44.802 --> 00:27:03.983
And I was in the middle of that and happily was able to maybe be a bit of a mediator or at least a shuttle diplomat between Dr. Miller and Dr. Williams to sort of bargain for relative position.

00:27:04.003 --> 00:27:09.889
I could understand Miller's position because the question would be, if I've got a matter

00:27:10.139 --> 00:27:23.397
that affect the mind of it, that I want approval from the Lord about it.

00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:36.214
Can I retain the evolution or development of my project or program without disclosing to the cancer doctors until I'm ready?

00:27:36.234 --> 00:27:37.696
I don't want to do it prematurely.

00:27:37.716 --> 00:27:39.218
And yet, I think

00:27:39.822 --> 00:27:46.709
that in the evolving of that program, I may need legal input.

00:27:46.729 --> 00:27:48.351
Where do you come out of that?

00:27:49.592 --> 00:27:53.256
Well, I would go to the university.

00:27:53.276 --> 00:27:58.041
Let me share with you an aspect.

00:27:58.061 --> 00:28:01.785
Where do I come in from?

00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:05.789
I don't like to work for people and know things.

00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:08.192
I mean, my loyalty needs to be

00:28:08.476 --> 00:28:35.361
But they don't want

00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:48.926
I never knew where that really put me.

00:28:49.066 --> 00:29:01.180
I mean, it didn't lift me out of the problem, but at least I had faith in God.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.015
description of it.

00:29:06.676 --> 00:29:23.800
He had recognized and gave me permission to work with any of our industries like that and give them the confidence that they deserved and what they called the attorney class relationship.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.200
That was a problem.

00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:31.470
And then the problem was whether or not Dr. Miller would offer a loan and had to know from before that I

00:29:32.058 --> 00:29:44.733
He set about immediately to rewrite the old objective rules and regulations and how pretty much to describe, at least, the person in charge of rewriting them.

00:29:44.753 --> 00:29:59.331
And John Blocker and Mr. Gibson and Mr. Davies, all these organization people were ahead with Sears and Southwestern Bell and Dressel.

00:29:59.648 --> 00:30:22.039
They were a committee of three at the board to work with working out this new entity that was created and rewrite the board's objective rules and regulations to conform to the fact that we now had a chancellor that had a president.

00:30:22.099 --> 00:30:29.149
The issue was, does the president report through the chancellor to the board on everything?

00:30:29.483 --> 00:30:59.203
And if the chancellor says no, does that mean or does the president have the right to make his best case with the board stipulating that the chancellor has not given this approval and the chancellor has even changed to articulate why he doesn't recognize it?

00:31:00.112 --> 00:31:19.836
Well, you know, we were in hypothetical situations that we were maneuvering in a hypothetical world.

00:31:19.937 --> 00:31:23.841
And that did not set me away.

00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:28.347
But that was the message I put out to the media.

00:31:29.373 --> 00:31:48.418
Dr. Williams was basically trying to be faithful.

00:31:48.438 --> 00:31:49.039
He asked me to take that back.

00:31:49.059 --> 00:31:49.479
And, you know, I did.

00:31:49.499 --> 00:31:50.541
I was on the auditorium, and I was the communicator.

00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:51.482
And Dr. Williams, I thought, you know, go, go.
