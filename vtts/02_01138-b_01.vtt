00:01.432 --> 00:05.857
I remember Uncle Jesse and we were going down the 
trail. He said, you know, Little Ava, you're old

00:06.317 --> 00:11.402
enough that you should be learning poetry. I'm 
going back when we get to the house and find my poem

00:12.163 --> 00:22.995
book, and I'm going to teach you a little poem about 
the flowers. I think that every little boy and girl

00:24.556 --> 00:29.542
should learn poetry when they're little. They'll 
appreciate it. Well, I didn't know what the word

00:31.486 --> 00:35.512
appreciate meant, so I asked him. But, of course, I 
didn't say appreciate. I said, appreciate. So he

00:39.839 --> 00:42.143
explained it to me. And when we got home, he found 
the...

00:43.024 --> 00:54.322
Look at us going from that one guy that we always go 
from door to door. We were just going to be able to

00:54.342 --> 00:58.489
just pause on them and pull apart their dick and 
take them. Uncle Jesse found his poem book and it

01:01.237 --> 01:07.610
was a long poem. I looked back several times in my 
childhood and wondered how in the world he took the

01:08.071 --> 01:17.389
patience and the time to teach me such a long poem. 
But I will recite as much of it as I can remember of it

01:17.791 --> 01:24.981
for you. The buttercups are coming and the scarlet 
columbines, and in the sunny meadows the

01:26.122 --> 01:34.995
dandelions shine. And just as many flowers as your 
soft hands can hold, the little ones may gather,

01:35.836 --> 01:46.330
all fair and white and gold. Here blows the warm red 
clover, here peeps the violet blue. Oh happy

01:52.467 --> 01:56.933
little children, God made them all for you. The 
little birds fly over and oh how sweet they sing to

01:57.915 --> 02:08.149
tell the happy children that once again it's 
spring. The gray, green grass comes creeping so

02:08.433 --> 02:14.020
soft beneath their feet. The frogs begin to 
ripple, a music clearing sweet. To me, that is a

02:19.747 --> 02:22.190
beautiful little poem. I have forgotten the last 
two verses, but that's been many, many years ago.

02:32.924 --> 02:35.487
Well, I... remember as we went on up there and he'd 
teach me that poem i'd have to learn a verse every

02:35.956 --> 03:02.537
day and then he took time out to show me uh the 
different types of little birds that flew over

02:35.956 --> 03:02.537
from this poem and he'd show me the birds nest and 
how they built them and he'd let me hear their call

02:35.956 --> 03:02.537
and then i had to learn a poem a about the birds and it 
was i know a secret just we three robin and i in the

03:02.821 --> 03:28.525
sweet cherry tree but robin knows it best because 
he built the little oh i can't tell the rest oh i'm

03:02.821 --> 03:28.525
afraid i'll tell you every minute but if the 
birdies in the tree don't feed I'll try my best the

03:29.095 --> 03:35.023
secret to keep. Now that one wasn't years so long, 
but I want you to know that it was the hardest words

03:35.043 --> 03:41.071
to say secret. And it was just a hard job for me to say 
those. I was tongue-tied when I was little. And my

03:49.963 --> 03:55.290
mother often laughed and said, I believe they 
clipped it at both ends. You just chatter all the

03:55.310 --> 03:57.073
time now. Well, That's one of those things that 
mothers get disgusted with little tutors right

03:58.441 --> 04:06.532
under their feet. My goodness, my mother had three 
of us right under her feet all at the same time, you

04:06.612 --> 04:11.840
might say. But that was a great experience. And you 
know, I look back and he

04:15.565 --> 04:26.040
taught me my first poem. Well, I don't know. I 
believe and I firmly believe that what is planted

04:28.597 --> 04:48.279
in children's mind when they're from one to seven 
is the making of their life as far as principle,

04:28.597 --> 04:48.279
love, and consideration of their fellow man. Now, 
I'm a strong believer in that, and I want you to know

04:49.160 --> 04:55.828
that Uncle Jesse didn't lay anything aside. He had 
a wonderful philosophy of life. However, he did

04:58.735 --> 05:01.360
have a temper. Well, I don't know a fellow worth a 
tinker's do that doesn't have one, just a little

05:02.181 --> 05:07.710
anyway. But I look back, and I had to learn speeches 
when I was little. Well, I had to learn to speak and

05:14.983 --> 05:19.090
get up.

05:21.314 --> 05:27.956
at Christmas time and say speeches to get my 
presents. So I guess it hasn't hurt me any.

05:34.325 --> 05:41.416
Well that was learn to say speeches when I was 
little and learn to ride horseback or ride I guess

05:34.325 --> 05:41.416
anything. I can remember Uncle Jesse putting me on 
the back of old Dink and that was an old milk cow, an

05:41.997 --> 05:54.797
old Jersey milk cow, raw boned as she could be and he 
put me up and let me ride her from the gate. up to the

05:55.216 --> 06:22.590
capian lot of an afternoon and of course that just 
thrilled me to death i'd have a bouquet of flowers

05:55.216 --> 06:22.590
for my mother in one hand and i'd be right i'm just 
setting up on the old dink if she'd have spoofed at

05:55.216 --> 06:22.590
anything i don't want to happen i guess flowers and 
me and uncle jesse's been scattered all up and down

05:55.216 --> 06:22.590
that trail because him with that wooden leg he 
didn't have wasn't too stable i wouldn't imagine

06:29.067 --> 06:46.505
As time went on, I remember my mother telling me, 
calling me one afternoon and said, Little Ava,

06:29.067 --> 06:46.505
don't you think that you could take your daddy a 
little bit of water up in the field? I know the water

06:46.645 --> 06:51.450
that he has is hot, and you could carry him up there, 
couldn't you? And I looked at her and I said, But the

06:52.170 --> 06:56.715
sticker's a bad mother. And she said, Yes, I know 
they're bad, but they'll be worse if your daddy

06:59.020 --> 07:14.477
doesn't have some water and can plow that corn 
because we won't have any cornbread for next year

06:59.020 --> 07:14.477
if we don't take care of it. Well, I don't know. That 
kind of stuck with me a lot of times, I thought. Now,

07:21.717 --> 07:25.963
if you don't do this, well, you're not going to have 
it next year. My mother laid a foundation of

07:26.764 --> 07:35.176
preparedness all the way through life for us 
children in more ways than one. That's just a

07:35.556 --> 07:38.420
simple illustration. She was always looking out 
for tomorrow to take care of her little brood.

07:43.655 --> 08:06.358
Anyway, I put on some shoes, and because the sand 
burrs were so bad and the bull nettles, and I went up

07:43.655 --> 08:06.358
and took my daddy some cool water, and it just 
thrilled him, and he just thought that was the

07:43.655 --> 08:06.358
grandest thing, that I'd walk up to the end of the 
turning row and bring him a cool drink of water. He

08:07.499 --> 08:12.784
was great to brag on his children when they did 
something, and of course we would I think that was

08:13.000 --> 08:14.201
great. I'm afraid in everyday life today we forget 
to pat our little folks on their back and tell them

08:14.462 --> 08:24.995
how proud we are of them. You know, just a spoonful 
of sugar makes the medicine go down a lot of times. I

08:30.441 --> 08:39.953
only wish that I could recall the many, many times 
that my daddy has bragged on me when I know I didn't

08:30.441 --> 08:39.953
do it. bang-up job, but he wanted me to feel like 
that I had done well. He was pleased. So after all,

08:48.732 --> 08:56.701
if you can please mother and daddy and please 
yourself, what else matters? It wasn't long until

08:59.023 --> 09:06.852
we moved back to Johnson City and my little sister 
Margaret was born out at Flat Creek. what we called

09:07.490 --> 09:09.473
the Steveson Place. And again, I couldn't say 
Steveson. I'd say the Teefy Place. And I did love

09:14.540 --> 09:18.164
Grandma and Grandpa Steveson so dearly. And 
again, there I was introduced to music. They

09:23.752 --> 09:31.422
always had Edgar and would play the jugs, 
washboard, or anything. Just made up a band of all

09:31.482 --> 09:36.349
the things that he could play right there in the old 
saw. And they had a regular band of their own, and

09:36.937 --> 09:41.125
we'd go over, and I'd be there. Grandma used to make 
the best homemade ice cream if anybody ever

09:41.145 --> 09:45.493
walked. And we'd have ice cream on Saturday night, 
and music, and sing. My mother and daddy both could

09:52.428 --> 09:58.695
sing so pretty together, and they'd all sing. For 
some reason, there never was a Sunday that ever

09:59.416 --> 10:07.084
went by as long as we lived on the part of Malice 
River. We didn't gather at Grandpa Johnson's and

10:07.645 --> 10:11.148
have singing. And his bunch of boys and girls could 
really sing, and he had a beautiful voice. And

10:19.958 --> 10:21.760
they'd play the piano and sing. And we moved down to 
Johnson City. Well, we missed going to Grandpa's

10:26.591 --> 10:31.256
on Sunday and singing. But we'd go over to 
Stevenson's and sing and have just as much fun. Not

10:37.003 --> 10:40.868
near as much fun, but we'd have a lot of fun. Then we 
stayed down at the Stevenson place the whole year.

10:48.097 --> 10:52.202
And Margaret was born on the 4th of May. Then in the 
fall, we moved back up to Stonewall. And Papa

10:59.737 --> 11:10.351
bought a part of Clarence Martin's place, which 
was Uncle Clarence. Bought 280 acres from him and

11:10.371 --> 11:21.987
160 from Grandpa Johnson and 160 from Willem Pesa 
that was our neighbor to the north of us. and

11:22.557 --> 11:43.941
margaret and i were little things and my daddy was 
farming and he had a team of oxen and old tom and ned

11:22.557 --> 11:43.941
and tom was the sweetest old steer that you ever saw 
and I'd go up into the field. My daddy would put me up

11:45.734 --> 11:50.060
on his back, and I'd get to ride home on old Tom. Oh, 
and that was more fun to get to ride. Tom was just as

11:53.464 --> 11:54.826
kind. But Ned wasn't. He wouldn't dare let you ride 
him. And my daddy would tell me, now, if you've got

11:59.112 --> 12:12.510
to be good to Tom, and you've got to shuck corn for 
him, and you've got to get his cottonseed ready,

11:59.112 --> 12:12.510
because if you don't, he won't walk. you to ride his 
back. You can imagine how little I was, but I'd

12:15.135 --> 12:34.544
shuck that corn, and I'll guarantee you I'd pack 
that cotton seed in that gallon bucket just as

12:15.135 --> 12:34.544
tight as I could get it so Tom would have all that he 
could eat that night in order that I could ride, get

12:15.135 --> 12:34.544
a chance to ride him again the next day. Well, that 
was one more way of promoting a kid into doing its

12:35.405 --> 12:40.793
work and doing it But that is just a wet philosophy 
of hanging kids, which is a good thing to me in lots

12:41.431 --> 12:48.539
of restaurants. My father had these two steers 
that he had decided that he, oxen rather, they

12:50.522 --> 13:07.682
were, well, they were steers, but they were oxen, 
that he wasn't going to try to use them any longer.

13:07.782 --> 13:10.105
He'd already gotten his land all broken. They were 
not very good at using in the rows. It was good to

13:14.183 --> 13:19.998
turn the land under, but when it came to the row 
crops, they were just not the best in the world.

13:20.820 --> 13:24.870
They were good, but not as good as he thought the 
little mules would be. So he bought a span of mules

13:25.846 --> 13:36.861
called Frank and Charlie after the two Stevenson 
boys were such good friends of his that we lived on

13:25.846 --> 13:36.861
down here on Flag Creek. And that's what he used 
then to lay his cotton by. I am sure that I was over

13:44.792 --> 13:54.165
four years old that summer, and my daddy fixed a 
little old. Well, it's a flower sack for me to pick

13:55.310 --> 14:00.612
cotton in. just work like a little turk getting 
that flour sack full of cotton. And my grandpa

14:05.738 --> 14:10.924
Johnson would brag on me and what a fine girl I was to 
help my daddy. And I'd come in and wash my hands and

14:11.605 --> 14:18.013
I'd always set the table for my mother. That was my 
job as a little bitty thing. And I'd set the table

14:23.860 --> 14:26.963
for her for every meal. And I can remember When we 
would sit down at the table, lots of times I'd be so

14:31.507 --> 14:43.342
tired and so hungry that I'd almost fall asleep 
after I got still. But my daddy, if it wasn't

14:44.303 --> 14:52.214
anything but God bless his food and our family. 
Amen. It was something that he was grateful for. at

14:59.958 --> 15:20.008
that time and we knew as little folks that we should 
bow our little head and then as time went on my

14:59.958 --> 15:20.008
mother taught me to say grace and my little sister 
and we took it turns about saying grace of a morning

14:59.958 --> 15:20.008
at the table something that I feel like that 
carries over into adult years and age. And I am

15:28.317 --> 15:37.370
grateful for the many, many things that my parents 
gave me in early childhood that I will remember.

15:40.674 --> 15:48.966
My father had rheumatic fever, or I say rheumatic 
fever, it was sciatic rheumatism, not rheumatic

15:40.674 --> 15:48.966
fever. sciatic rheumatism, and the doctor 
thought it was from riding our cultivator seat and

15:49.418 --> 15:58.469
bruising that sciatic nerve. Well, we sold out and 
we moved down and bought a place on the Perlin Allis

15:59.771 --> 16:11.705
again, down on the river from Louie Danz. In other 
words, we just swapped places with him. And of

16:15.570 --> 16:17.552
course, Louie had a lot more land than we did, but it 
wasn't tillable soil like ours was a stone bowl.

16:23.307 --> 16:33.822
But we moved down there, which is about two miles 
from my grandmother Chapman, about a mile from my

16:23.307 --> 16:33.822
Aunt Ola and Uncle Buddy Chapman. And we'd have to 
ride to school, and that was about six miles to

16:35.084 --> 16:41.252
school, horseback. But my goodness life, I had 
been riding everything since I could remember

16:45.815 --> 16:47.897
almost. And Grandpa Johnson bought me an old pony 
when I wasn't but two years old and a saddle. And the

16:56.865 --> 17:00.048
old pony's name was Old Cousy. And my saddle was a 
little old Mexican. It had a great big old horn like

17:05.153 --> 17:07.676
a Mexican saddle. And he picked it up somewhere and 
brought it to me. And I'd go down. I'd ride down to

17:15.582 --> 17:24.177
his house, go across that river, get his mail over 
on the other side at the Lutheran Church, and bring

17:15.582 --> 17:24.177
it back. He'd see me coming. He was sitting on that 
porch, and he'd say, ha, ha, ha, you're riding old

17:25.980 --> 17:32.411
koozie. And that just tickled me to death. Grandpa 
would laugh and and asked me if I was riding the old

17:36.878 --> 17:39.501
coosie. Of course, it just thrilled me, and I 
couldn't get her out of a snail's gate. If you'd

17:44.547 --> 17:49.473
fall off of her, she'd just stand there and wait 
until you got her to get back on. But she's always so

17:49.894 --> 18:02.008
tall, I always had to lead her up to a gate to get on 
her, climb up on the gate, and then on to her because

17:49.894 --> 18:02.008
I couldn't reach the stirrup bus a little. But it 
wasn't any trouble, I'll assure you, to ride,

18:03.710 --> 18:10.579
because I learned that from the cradle on. We came 
up here to Johnson City to school, and that was just

18:11.861 --> 18:24.157
like, oh, it was a foreign country in more ways than 
one. The people along Pearl and Alice up there, one

18:25.839 --> 18:30.645
big family. They were German folks and I learned to 
talk German. I could talk German about as well as I

18:36.550 --> 18:40.154
could English or maybe better. I could think 
faster in German than I could in English. And I came

18:44.999 --> 18:51.786
down here and I didn't mix at all good with them 
because they all didn't anybody talk German. Of

18:51.806 --> 18:59.535
course I butchered it up like it was pitiful the way 
I butcher up my English with the German. lots of

19:00.477 --> 19:26.738
times i didn't get well i just didn't get anything 
done at school and my daddy and mother would have to

19:00.477 --> 19:26.738
come in and see what was wrong well it was just a 
language handicap that was all it was a barrier and

19:00.477 --> 19:26.738
i think that's one of the things when i was teaching 
school i had such a feeling for the children who had

19:00.477 --> 19:26.738
that language barrier And I helped them, and I 
guess I went over backwards towards helping them

19:27.578 --> 19:41.084
to get straightened out, more so than I did the 
others that were less fortunate in the work. But it

19:42.286 --> 19:48.237
was a great experience, and I enjoyed going to 
school, and I'd go by. and something go wrong i'd

19:48.605 --> 20:09.027
stop and tell my grandma chapman and man she'd call 
up my mother and she'd say now those little things i

19:48.605 --> 20:09.027
they stopped by here and i gave them something deep 
now you dress up the children warmer it's going to

19:48.605 --> 20:09.027
be cold tomorrow now you be sure and send them a 
slicker oh i'll tell you she gave orders My mother

20:09.580 --> 20:12.123
would have to follow that. Grandfather Johnson 
and Grandmother Johnson on the other end. I'll

20:16.689 --> 20:29.144
tell you, I don't know how my mother and dad ever got 
along as well as they did with us because we were the

20:16.689 --> 20:29.144
oldest of the Klan Johnson kids and the oldest of 
the Chapmans. And I'll tell you, they both were

20:29.184 --> 20:35.351
after my mother and father all the time. Well, 
those kids are gonna get killed. You let them ride,

20:37.133 --> 20:39.216
you let them do anything. My poor old mother, bless 
her heart, she'd walk out every morning to see us

20:39.871 --> 20:45.420
off on those horses. And she said, girls, don't 
ride so fast. Now take your time. You've got plenty

20:49.907 --> 20:51.770
of time to get to school. And be careful. My mother 
would go back in the house to finish her work. My

20:56.578 --> 20:57.961
daddy would be at the gate. And he'd reach over and 
cut a peach tree. and switch, and he'd say, here,

21:01.927 --> 21:11.342
girls, use it on those old horses and put the button 
to them and get there so you can play if you want to.

21:12.244 --> 21:17.372
Now, that wasn't exactly right, but I can remember 
him doing it, and it just tickled us dead. We'd wait

21:17.432 --> 21:21.819
every morning for him to cut us a switch to get those 
old horses going. Well, we made it through those

21:22.941 --> 21:26.787
years. it's a it's a wonder i've had a lot of great 
experiences for instance mr at the hyatts lived

21:28.302 --> 21:55.288
across the river from us and there wasn't a 
woodsman in the world that was as great as sid hyatt

21:28.302 --> 21:55.288
i don't guess he knew all about the animals how they 
borrowed why they hid their their their young in

21:56.720 --> 21:59.284
the manner they did. He absolutely studied and 
knew wildlife and nature from every angle. And it

22:06.636 --> 22:12.205
was such a pleasure to ride the pasture with him and 
he'd tell you all about it and he'd show you. It was

22:13.987 --> 22:14.849
wonderful.

22:18.775 --> 22:21.900
I'm just wondering if you ever, ever watched a 
mother coon and her babies when she would take them

22:22.690 --> 22:32.616
down to the river and teach them to fish. I'll tell 
you, that is one of the most fascinating things

22:32.917 --> 22:40.484
that a little person ever watched in their life. I 
don't know how Uncle Sid ever kept me quiet long

22:40.504 --> 22:45.708
enough that I could watch it all, but I did. And I can 
remember it. That was the cutest thing that I ever

22:47.450 --> 22:51.673
hoped to see in my life. And I wish it were possible 
that every child could see a mother coon teaching

22:51.693 --> 23:02.603
her babies to fish and how she'd do it. It was just as 
much like a human being teaching her child. And

23:08.231 --> 23:12.396
you'd hear her just chatter and chatter to those 
little babies on the bank. And she'd catch them in

23:13.017 --> 23:15.861
that fur and she'd shake them. She'd just shake 
them good whenever they didn't do what she told

23:16.422 --> 23:21.148
them to do. And one was a bad one and it reminded me of 
myself, I guess. It was always a first to try

23:26.137 --> 23:35.976
something and it went down to try and she turned 
around and she grabbed that little fella and she

23:26.137 --> 23:35.976
shook him good.

23:39.783 --> 23:43.710
I forgot all about the most important thing that 
happened. when I lived up at Stonewall before I

23:44.298 --> 23:51.146
moved down to Johnson City the second time. 
Grandfather gave me this old mare called old Cousy

23:52.607 --> 24:00.015
when I was two years old in this little saddle. And I 
was so proud of it. And I would go by and pick Lennon

24:03.960 --> 24:11.368
up and ask him if he wanted to go down right across 
the river with me and get the mail. And every time

24:11.804 --> 24:21.900
that we'd go over there to get the mail, he always 
wanted to ride in front of the saddle and do the

24:11.804 --> 24:21.900
guiding. And I'd let him because it was easier to 
say, yes, you can do it than it was to fuss and battle

24:21.920 --> 24:30.053
with him. And I'd always lose anyway, so I'd give up 
and let him ride in front because I'd have plenty of

24:30.113 --> 24:38.807
fun riding her home. And all I wanted to ride, and he 
didn't get to ride. His mother never let him. And if

24:43.927 --> 24:47.196
she'd catch us before we got off, she wouldn't let 
him go then. She's always afraid something

24:47.296 --> 24:49.361
happened to him. But he went with me that day. And we 
went to take Grandpa Johnson's mail to him, and

24:54.160 --> 25:00.386
then went back down to his house. We got up there 
where Grandpa was. Grandpa sat down. He told us to

25:05.271 --> 25:06.413
get down. He had us something there. And got down 
off our horse and gave him his mail, and he had us

25:08.795 --> 25:14.421
some peppermint candy. And we sat down, and he 
began to talk to us. And he told Lyndon that He

25:23.472 --> 25:25.575
should always ride behind. Little

25:25.615 --> 25:34.427
ladies needed to ride in the saddle, and they 
needed to keep their clothes clean. To be a nice man

25:35.128 --> 25:39.955
and polite and kind, he should ride behind me. 
Lennon said, well, I don't ever get to be the front

25:40.416 --> 25:46.965
rider, and I want to be up front sometime.

25:48.987 --> 25:55.720
Grandfather talked to him a long time and finally 
convinced him that it was his place to ride behind.

25:55.760 --> 26:07.983
Grandpa

25:55.760 --> 26:07.983
told him, said, now as long as you live, Lennon, 
you're going to know that little Ava is your big

25:55.760 --> 26:07.983
sister and you're going to have to listen to what 
she tells you. You're going to have to be good to

26:08.524 --> 26:10.067
her.

26:16.797 --> 26:21.824
Now children, remember that you mustn't take 
sides against one another. Be sure you know that

26:21.864 --> 26:36.987
you're on the right side and stand by one another 
because nobody else is going to take up for you like

26:21.864 --> 26:36.987
your own flesh and blood. And there's not but one 
thing I can tell you. And he got up and he stretched

26:42.034 --> 26:45.960
his body run his hands through his beard, and he 
said, just remember this, kids, that blood runs

26:46.632 --> 27:04.797
deeper than water, and you can't turn against your 
own flesh and blood, regardless of what they do in

26:46.632 --> 27:04.797
life. If you don't stand by them, who is? Think 
about it. Don't get mad at your little sister now,

27:12.268 --> 27:16.133
Lennon, and get on and Ride like a little man. Well, 
we got on, and we went on down to Aunt Rebecca's, and

27:18.587 --> 27:24.555
she gave us a lecture about going off without 
telling her. So over the time that we got around the

27:25.356 --> 27:32.186
back of the house, Linda says, I'm going to tell you 
something, little Ava. If I'm going to have to ride

27:32.346 --> 27:40.197
behind,

27:32.346 --> 27:40.197
we're going to fatten this old mare up. We're going 
to put some flesh on her bones, because I'm not

27:42.404 --> 27:46.570
going to ride behind here. These old bones 
sticking through, they hurt. I said, well, how are

27:51.377 --> 27:53.280
we going to do it? He said, well, can you unsaddle 
her? And I said, yes, I can unsaddle her, but I can't

27:55.984 --> 28:01.231
get that saddle back on her when I get ready to go 
home. He said, well, we won't worry about that.

28:06.383 --> 28:08.086
Pablo will be here in a little bit. That was a 
Mexican boy that worked for Uncle Sam. He said,

28:11.390 --> 28:14.415
Pablo will be in to milk the cow a little bit. And I 
said, we'll get him to saddle her. Well, that sold

28:17.259 --> 28:25.531
the deal with me, and I wanted to play a little while 
with Lennon anyway, so we unsaddled her. We got a

28:26.293 --> 28:29.337
wash tub and went to the oak bench. And we filled 
that thing up about half full of oats and put it out

28:29.857 --> 28:33.540
there. We were going to get her good and fat. And she 
ate until she couldn't eat. Then she drank some

28:38.044 --> 28:41.307
water, and we never could get the saddle on her, of 
course. She found her. She died that night. But I

28:45.991 --> 28:49.875
did get the saddle, get the masseuse to put the 
saddle on her. And by that time, she'd already

28:49.895 --> 28:52.938
begun to swell. So when I got ready to go home, there 
wasn't any use in trying to, to saddle it up. I just

29:01.330 --> 29:08.642
sat up on that saddle just like it was girded up 
tight on her, but it wasn't. Went home next morning

29:08.662 --> 29:15.955
when I went out to the barn, my old koozie was laying 
dead in the hammer and the thing. Linda and I

29:15.975 --> 29:18.039
fattened her up overnight. That was another thing 
that, boy, it stays with me forever. I couldn't

29:24.785 --> 29:29.732
hardly stand the idea of taking old Cousy off and 
letting the buzzards eat her. And that was

29:30.753 --> 29:34.738
something else that Uncle Jesse did. He took me 
down, and he said, did you ever see a buzzard dance?

29:40.086 --> 29:41.608
Well, I said, no, no. How does he do that? Do they 
have partners? He said, I'll take you down and show

29:45.012 --> 29:47.756
you. We went down to where old Cousy was. And those 
old buzzards would hop all around and how they'd

29:51.397 --> 29:57.844
run up and grab and run back. And it was a buzzard 
dance, all right. It was something to behold. And

30:02.228 --> 30:17.404
that was another experience that I'll donate to 
Uncle Jesse for being pretty good about teaching

30:02.228 --> 30:17.404
you the where's and wherefores of life with 
nature.

30:19.595 --> 30:33.122
As long as I can remember, when it came Christmas 
time, we always went up to Uncle Clarence

30:19.595 --> 30:33.122
Martin's, what is now the Texas White House, and 
that's where we would have our Christmas. The

30:33.783 --> 30:40.557
inside of this living room, where the Christmas 
tree was always placed, is a huge fireplace that

30:41.110 --> 30:44.895
burns four-foot wood. It has a hearth that is built 
up 17 inches from the floor. And we would stand up on

30:51.583 --> 31:03.118
this hearth for our stage to say our speeches or 
sing our songs or to do our dance, whatever. And

31:03.098 --> 31:11.626
then we were given our present from the Christmas 
tree after everyone had finished performing. And

31:12.627 --> 31:21.635
Uncle Clarence would always see that we had all the 
fruit and candy and cookies that we could take care

31:12.627 --> 31:21.635
of for the day. He was always great to have his own 
pups, and he was a great hunter. And we loved dogs,

31:29.203 --> 31:32.886
and we thought how much fun would be to get out and 
play with them. He'd let us turn them loose and play

31:36.477 --> 31:46.251
and they'd run and we would run with them and they'd 
bark and oh it was just a lot of fun. We thought how

31:46.351 --> 31:49.395
much fun it would be to ten can them. So we put the 
dogs back in the dog run which was the side of the

31:50.197 --> 31:56.185
fence there. We caught one at a time and we had ten 
cans and rolled up paper bags and were tied to their

32:01.351 --> 32:06.421
tails and whatnot, turned them loose. And Uncle 
Clarence came out, and he saw that, and he called us

32:07.303 --> 32:13.455
all in and set us down. And we had court on this 
fireplace hearth, and we were all up in front of it.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.643
And, of course, he was the judge. He talked to us 
about how bad that we had acted, that how good he'd

32:23.704 --> 32:34.724
been to us for this Christmas, how wonderful he 
thought it'd be. And then we went out and tinned

32:34.744 --> 32:36.989
Candy's dog. Well, it was more than... five 
minutes till we were all in tears and begging to to

32:39.353 --> 33:09.360
forgive us and ask him to please give us another 
chance that we would never do him that way again and

32:39.353 --> 33:09.360
he made us promise that we wouldn't to fulfill that 
he suggested that we all bring in so many loads of

32:39.353 --> 33:09.360
wood and put there by the fireplace to use well we 
were punished all right and by having to do that

33:09.340 --> 33:13.045
work. Then when it was time to eat our lunch that day 
at dinner time, as a usual thing, he always fixed a

33:13.065 --> 33:22.277
great long table for all of us to eat by. But he 
postponed that a little bit that day, and all the

33:23.218 --> 33:30.108
grown folks ate and got through. Well, he had the 
made to come in and clear the table and put us a plate

33:33.117 --> 33:57.640
down he came in told us now that this is another 
thing that he had done he prepared a wonderful meal

33:33.117 --> 33:57.640
for us and hoping

33:33.117 --> 33:57.640
that his little dogs would at least get the bones 
but he wasn't about to trust us to go out there to

33:33.117 --> 33:57.640
feed him but no telling what we'd do to him And he 
didn't know whether he'd ever be able to trust us

33:58.193 --> 34:01.882
again or not. Well, that started the music all over 
again. And we told him how sorry we were and we

34:04.668 --> 34:09.821
wouldn't do it again. So we ate our dinner. We got 
through. And, of course, we were more anxious than

34:15.693 --> 34:19.539
ever to get the bones to the dogs. We took them out 
there and brought our plates back in. When we came

34:23.906 --> 34:31.078
back in, well, he said, well, he was going up to 
Stonewall, but didn't suppose that we'd want to

34:23.906 --> 34:31.078
go. We'd rather stay there and tend Candy's dogs. 
Well, we finally got him to let us go. In place of

34:39.586 --> 34:44.390
going to Stonewall, we went on up to 
Fredericksburg. And we had a nice evening out. We

34:47.473 --> 34:48.494
came back in. Our parents were waiting for us. 
Uncle Clarence said, oh, well, that's all right,

34:52.898 --> 34:55.160
you folks. Just go on home. Leave the children here 
with me. Because they'll have a good early start in

34:58.823 --> 35:04.768
the morning, and they'll have a dog apiece, the tin 
can. Well, we didn't live that down for a long time,

35:07.195 --> 35:13.665
I'll guarantee you, but we learned our lesson 
right fast. He was a very persistent judge, and he

35:14.586 --> 35:23.120
had great reasoning ability, and he really had a 
way with kids. Made a big impression on our lives, I

35:23.781 --> 35:27.947
would say that, for Uncle Clarence. He never made a 
better man, a better Christian man. He was really a

35:32.254 --> 35:34.317
wonderful person. And we look forward every year 
to going to the big house for our Christmas. I can't

35:40.594 --> 35:47.362
ever remember going to Grandfather Johnson's 
when Uncle Clarence was living, because we'd go up

35:40.594 --> 35:47.362
there. That's the way he wanted it. That's the way 
it was.

35:57.553 --> 36:03.780
Whenever it was threshing time in the spring of the 
year, My mother would always go down and help paint

36:04.216 --> 36:17.450
Frank with the threshing, and then

36:04.216 --> 36:17.450
she in turn would help my mother up at our place. 
This year, my mother made chili in a big wash pot.

36:22.636 --> 36:23.937
I'll never forget that. I thought, my goodness 
alive, so much chili. But nevertheless, it was all

36:27.701 --> 36:33.227
eaten because all of the hands came around from 
They would bring theirs from the joining fields

36:33.832 --> 36:39.364
there at Clarence Martin's in Thrash. And they had 
beans and chili,

36:40.165 --> 36:54.996
homemade light bread, coffee. And I can't 
remember the type of cake. All I remember is it was a

36:59.849 --> 37:01.551
cake. I didn't care very much for cake as a kid 
unless it had a lot of filling on it. And sure

37:06.317 --> 37:10.002
enough, this didn't, so I didn't pay much 
attention to that. And they had all kinds of

37:11.043 --> 37:18.433
salads, green salads and fresh vegetables from 
the garden. In other words, it was a feast to behold

37:18.453 --> 37:23.039
when freshening time came. And everybody pitched 
in and helped. All the neighbors would come and

37:26.870 --> 37:31.298
bring food at noon and help with everything. That 
is when, that was when living was real living and

37:32.360 --> 37:42.077
man, a friend and Indeed, a need was a friend 
indeed, and they all gathered at that time. Petty

37:48.339 --> 37:50.902
jealousies and things didn't exist. If they did, 
they were set aside when it comes to things like

37:51.422 --> 38:02.353
that because everyone flew in and helped their 
neighbor, and they got along like one big family.

38:02.554 --> 38:09.921
It was a wonderful thing to grow up in a community 
that had that much community spirit and love. I

38:10.812 --> 38:19.743
cherish those memories because that implanted in 
me one of the greatest things that life could have,

38:10.812 --> 38:19.743
unselfishness. And in that little community, you 
didn't find it. Everybody loved and wanted to

38:23.808 --> 38:26.251
help. If you wanted to build a barn, they'd come in 
and help you. You didn't have to go hire somebody to

38:29.595 --> 38:32.498
help you. They helped you do it. There's always 
someone who was a good partner that would always

38:34.941 --> 38:39.587
come out and help. My daddy helped haul the lumber 
that built the first school there, the Little

38:40.293 --> 38:49.505
Junction School, where Lena and I went to school. 
Do you think that they paid people to build that?

38:53.551 --> 38:53.851
No. All the community went together, and they 
built that little schoolhouse. Now that shows

39:01.281 --> 39:03.684
community spirit. That shows love for their 
children. and to show you that there was no

39:07.799 --> 39:20.223
animosity toward their church or toward this 
strife of religious colored creed or whatnot. In

39:21.686 --> 39:26.736
the summertime, the

39:21.686 --> 39:26.736
minister of the Lutheran Church would conduct a 
little, well, much like your Head Start program

39:26.716 --> 39:37.728
for all little folks that had never been to school, 
and he would start them right there. And whether

39:38.950 --> 39:48.641
you were a little Mexican boy or a little Mexican 
girl, well, we didn't have any colored folks

39:38.950 --> 39:48.641
working there, but always lots of Mexicans. We 
went to school with them, and they loved it. this

39:52.872 --> 40:22.069
minister's name is best I can remember Reverend 
Heinrich and he was one of the sweetest if you say

39:52.872 --> 40:22.069
men are sweet you say they're kind and they're 
gentle well he certainly was and he took so much

39:52.872 --> 40:22.069
pains with us in trying to put forth in everyday 
life what it meant to be good to our fellow man and to

39:52.872 --> 40:22.069
love one another I don't think that anyone could be 
brought up in an atmosphere of love any more than we

40:22.825 --> 40:35.063
were and to love our fellow man. And Grandpa 
Johnson used to say to us, you speak. It never cost

40:40.085 --> 40:47.614
you a penny to smile and say good morning, but it may 
cost you a lot not to sometime. It's always best to

40:48.355 --> 40:53.461
be happy and be grateful for what you have. It could 
be that you wouldn't have anything, and then you

40:53.942 --> 41:00.550
would have something to grumble about. But 
whoever you meet in the morning, you speak. Be sure

41:04.861 --> 41:06.302
you do that. I can remember that, and I was just a 
little bitty treat. And that's one of the traits

41:12.788 --> 41:17.272
that has followed me all through life. Be friendly 
and speak to your fellow man. It never costs a penny

41:21.416 --> 41:24.779
to smile and say good morning. You know, that's a 
pretty good philosophy when you stop to think

41:25.820 --> 41:29.864
about it. It pays dividends.

41:34.662 --> 41:43.313
As we would look back on our little school, we had 
double desks in this little school. And your

41:44.695 --> 41:56.850
partner was supposed to always be older than you 
were and take care of you. In other words, it was a

41:57.231 --> 42:02.998
big sister and little sister game, a big brother 
and little brother. And I think that is a pretty

42:03.451 --> 42:06.856
good idea. And there were eight grades in this 
little school. The older students would help the

42:10.882 --> 42:15.990
younger ones with their work, and we enjoyed it. 
And then we would read to one another, and we would

42:16.491 --> 42:21.839
spell and do our numbers. I know for sure and 
certain, without a doubt, that we got a better

42:22.920 --> 42:31.213
foundation In our work. Then then we have today. 
Because I'm a teacher and I know from where I speak.

42:42.112 --> 42:45.215
When I was in the first grade, came to Johnson City. 
I want you to know Miss Florence Walker was my first

42:46.336 --> 42:49.979
teacher here. We had to know every one of our 
multiplication tables. And we knew him. Don't

42:57.165 --> 42:58.066
think we didn't. And we had to know how to read. and 
spell, and we didn't go anywhere. We were retained

43:05.837 --> 43:09.482
until we did get the basics. I don't know. They say, 
who fails? Is it the teacher or is it the child?

43:17.874 --> 43:20.918
Well, that is a $64 question. Who does fail? It 
takes two people to make a failure. Now, remember,

43:26.126 --> 43:28.189
it takes two. One can't do it all by himself. It 
takes two of us. Anyway, Lennon was always an avid

43:34.610 --> 43:45.682
reader, and I was always very quick with my math, so 
we made a pretty good pair. My sister always

43:47.604 --> 43:54.011
depended upon me for arithmetic, geometry, or 
anything like that. She'd come to me first and ask

43:54.791 --> 43:58.235
me. I cared very little about language. I didn't 
like it. I liked the literature part of English,

44:04.293 --> 44:14.645
but I didn't care a thing in the world about verbs, 
adjectives, nouns, things. That's just

44:14.725 --> 44:28.562
something that was dry to me, and I had to learn to 
like it and to cultivate a desire for

44:14.725 --> 44:28.562
it. We always took our lunch to school and lots of 
times we didn't have too much for lunch. It was

44:36.302 --> 44:47.580
always for sure we would have cured ham, sausage, 
molasses and bread or jelly and bread, butter. And

44:48.725 --> 44:51.892
some kind of cookie or some kind of cake. Sometimes 
our mother would fix a fried pie for us or something

44:51.952 --> 44:57.864
sweet. Anyway, we'd always have in our lunch 
basket. And we'd put our lunches down in the back of

45:01.769 --> 45:09.176
the room in the corner for everybody to see, and 
you'd know your own lunch basket. And we'd go out to

45:10.217 --> 45:18.284
play, and Mom would always fix us a sandwich that we 
could eat at the morning recess because we'd be

45:10.217 --> 45:18.284
hungry. We went in to get this, and the Klein boy 
opened up his lunch basket, and there was a

45:18.304 --> 45:29.194
beautiful piece of meringue pie in it. Lennon 
opened up his basket, got his sandwich out, and he

45:30.473 --> 45:36.480
kept eyeing that pie. And he said to me, he said, 
isn't that a pretty pie? I said, it sure is. He said,

45:41.385 --> 45:46.591
I wish Mother or Aunt Kitty would make one like that 
sometimes. I said, well, I do too. I said, come on,

45:48.853 --> 45:55.080
we're going to lose out in our game if we don't go on 
and get out there. I caught him by the hand, and out

45:55.786 --> 46:01.374
the door we went, and I missed him in a little bit, 
and I couldn't find him anywhere. He'd gone back in

46:02.916 --> 46:04.338
the house. He'd gone back in the house, and when he 
got in there, he got a hold of this pie, and he got

46:06.020 --> 46:15.773
that meringue all over his face. And he tried to 
wipe it off the best he could, but sure enough, he

46:17.275 --> 46:24.004
just made a bigger mess out of it. And he came out 
there, and I never will forget Hugo Klein saying, I

46:24.558 --> 46:34.853
believe somebody has been in my lunch basket. And 
he went in there and he said, Lyndon, did you eat all

46:34.893 --> 46:38.759
my pie? And Lyndon said, well, of course I didn't 
eat it all. And Hugo said, no, I don't guess you did,

46:43.326 --> 46:48.894
because more than half of it's on your face. And 
Miss Nell Murphy. turned around and said, well, I

46:53.262 --> 46:57.868
think it's time. Kids is getting in here and 
cleaning up now. It's time to get to work. So I had to

47:04.396 --> 47:09.723
take Lemon back to the back of the room, wash pan. 
The teacher always kept a rag there for us to use.

47:14.828 --> 47:26.820
She called me up to the table, and she said, now, 
little Ava, take him back there and clean him up,

47:14.828 --> 47:26.820
because he's just in the biggest mess, and he'll 
get that sticky stuff all over his book. I took him

47:26.840 --> 47:30.390
back and cleaned him up. I told him that we'd have to 
share our lunch now with Hugo because he had eaten

47:30.910 --> 47:35.921
it up. He said, oh, that'll be all right. I said, 
I'll give him my peanut butter. And I said, well, he

47:40.531 --> 47:44.760
may not like peanut butter. I said, you'd better 
give him that piece of candy you have in there. He

47:49.287 --> 47:52.290
said, well, you say so? I said, yes. I said, you sure 
should. So he, in the place of giving him just one

47:55.192 --> 48:00.737
piece of candy, he gave him all of his candy. And he 
said, I am so sorry for you. I won't do that anymore.

48:06.022 --> 48:11.406
And his teacher heard him say he was so sorry he 
wouldn't do it anymore. And she made quite a to-do

48:12.107 --> 48:17.792
because he hadn't been reprimanded by her as yet. 
And she was going to do that, and he had already

48:18.312 --> 48:25.481
apologized and told him that he wouldn't do that 
again. And that made everybody feel good, and

48:25.501 --> 48:36.475
Lennon felt like he was quite a big boy because he 
had apologized and his teacher thought it was the

48:25.501 --> 48:36.475
best thing. But that is one thing that Grandfather 
Johnson had taught us, and we had to listen

48:36.495 --> 48:42.262
whenever he spoke. We didn't sit there and mumble. 
We listened to everything he said. If we didn't, It

48:48.603 --> 48:50.306
would have been bad business.

48:54.134 --> 48:59.225
In November of 1910, my brother was born on the 
Paisley Place. I was the proudest one person of my

49:00.127 --> 49:02.912
little brother. I thought he was the prettiest 
thing. I never will forget what my grandfather

49:06.219 --> 49:09.666
Chapman said. He says, Kit, you better go in there 
and see about that baby. That girl will drag him off

49:14.784 --> 49:20.058
just like an old cat with a kitten. Says she'll have 
him and have doll clothes on him in another hour if

49:20.078 --> 49:24.550
you're not watching her. Well, sure enough, I 
didn't put the dog clothes on him, but I'll

49:26.302 --> 49:39.179
guarantee you I had him in my arms and in my little 
rocker that my grandfather Checkman had given me,

49:26.302 --> 49:39.179
and I was rocking him when my mother came in. She 
said, honey, how did you do that? I said, well, I'm a

49:41.762 --> 49:43.344
big girl. I can take care of my baby brother. And I 
was a big girl. I could do nearly anything that my

49:48.711 --> 49:53.878
mother would ask me to do, and that's was for sure I 
did take care of him and my little sister. I was a

49:59.798 --> 50:04.345
little mother to all of the children because I was 
the oldest. And I did try to look after him and I did

50:04.365 --> 50:09.452
care for him to the best of my ability. It was a great 
pleasure but a responsibility that I will never

50:10.454 --> 50:14.500
forget. Sometimes I look back and wonder how I ever 
got by, because Margaret and Lennon had double

50:15.509 --> 50:26.306
teamed on me and decided they were not going to do 
something. They'd wheel the tar out of me and

50:27.047 --> 50:35.961
finally get me over on their side, and then we'd all 
get a spanking when we got home for not doing the

50:27.047 --> 50:35.961
right thing. And they wonder how that happened. 
You can't stand off two strong heads like my sister

50:41.092 --> 50:47.101
and Linda if you know either one of them. They're 
going to win in the long run. But Uncle Sam didn't

50:51.468 --> 50:55.173
mind using the razor strap, neither did my daddy. 
And I'd get a spanking for not making them do, and

50:56.455 --> 51:02.725
then they'd get a spanking for not minding. So 
that's the way that went. And that's the way it was

51:05.649 --> 51:09.715
all through school.

51:10.589 --> 51:38.841
I don't regret it, but sometimes I wonder what in 
the world went wrong.

51:43.225 --> 51:56.257
Oh,

51:43.225 --> 51:56.257
here

51:43.225 --> 51:56.257
we

51:43.225 --> 51:56.257
go.

52:00.501 --> 52:11.612
She looks

52:00.501 --> 52:11.612
like a monkey when she

52:00.501 --> 52:11.612
does it. It's like I've got athletes on top of the 
foot. Yeah. Athletes in step. Sorry, she's doing

52:21.871 --> 52:23.193
elephant calls now. What calls? One second.

52:31.786 --> 52:32.888
Do it again. It's not as good as your penguin. Yeah, 
hold on to it. Listen. Do your penguin. Okay, he

52:38.516 --> 52:42.983
wants to talk to you. No, I'm embarrassed. Jackie, 
you're embarrassed? You're all touching. No, I'm

52:50.963 --> 52:52.064
not. No, get her on your shoulder. Get off. I'm 
falling at it. Yes, that's what it feels like. Did

52:59.632 --> 53:00.794
you just call it forward? Did you hear that? It was 
her barfing. No, she just barfs all the time. She's

53:10.725 --> 53:12.366
got ulcers. Why did you give her an ulcer? I'm 
surprised I don't have five hours. It's Sherry.

53:18.739 --> 53:19.120
What? Hold on. What? They asked me to do that one 
burpee. Huh? They asked me in the lobby to do that

53:24.028 --> 53:26.131
one burpee. Oh, really? I said, it's Sherry. 
Jackie! Y'all, do we still have five hours? Not

53:32.821 --> 53:37.488
too long. Probably start at six. From 9 p.m. at 
night until 5 p.m. at night. They ought to have,

53:44.725 --> 53:50.875
like, from 1 to 1. Uh-huh. From 9 to 9. Uh, so, you 
know, like, if they want to be steady, they want to

53:52.377 --> 54:01.070
get to sleep. Now, from 9 at night until 9 at night. 
Give me your majority on that. Oh, I'm writing on

54:05.898 --> 54:07.961
the wrong side of this page. Gotcha. I can't 
understand. That's okay. I'd laugh at you. I'd

54:09.523 --> 54:10.525
laugh at you. Sure you can. Do you want to close one 
of my pages? I told Rex to make your fish when they

54:13.987 --> 54:23.919
shit ass. I can't believe

54:23.999 --> 54:29.966
you're complaining. Y'all, what'd they say when 
y'all told them about what happened? I gotta tell

54:33.491 --> 54:37.075
y'all something, Rose.

54:42.083 --> 54:48.956
Y'all,

54:42.083 --> 54:48.956
now what can we sing to Rick? We love you, Rick. Oh, 
yes, we do. Yeah, you want to sing that? No way. We

54:55.549 --> 54:57.332
are blue. You are here. Jen! Shit, I'm going to walk 
like that. Oh, yes, we do. We don't love anyone as

55:06.738 --> 55:09.782
much as you. Yes, I do. When you're far from us, 
we're blue. Oh, Rick, we love you. Y'all say that to

55:17.193 --> 55:18.816
me when I feel bad. I'll be the bad guy. We love you, 
Kai.

55:30.032 --> 55:36.001
Y'all, we are all like instruments in the same 
instrumental song. Pop, pop. I got to dry my hair

55:36.944 --> 55:43.933
one of these days.

55:46.496 --> 56:04.600
I think

55:46.496 --> 56:04.600
I'm going to have to start washing every day. Why? 
Is that a great one? Yeah. Y'all I'm getting

56:08.045 --> 56:16.958
varicose veins. I have one too.

56:23.989 --> 56:31.660
I think he cut

56:23.989 --> 56:31.660
his arm. Is he on the phone

56:31.740 --> 56:36.807
right now? Yeah. Well, he's, I mean, you know, 
checking some of them. Uh-huh. Was he at the

56:45.090 --> 56:46.092
grocery store? Uh-huh. I'm glad we didn't go 
dancing. I don't think I've been taken. I don't

56:52.002 --> 56:52.763
either. Besides the cost of my hair. Did you go to 
the security? Huh? I got my towels falling off my

56:57.972 --> 56:59.114
hair. Did I? Did I? Enabler to her? I did.

57:09.098 --> 57:11.101
Jerry! Belly dance. Pussy dance. Oh my God. I'm 
embarrassed y'all are in red. You cornucate

57:21.035 --> 57:25.441
last night. I can't right now. No.

57:41.937 --> 57:52.654
No,

57:41.937 --> 57:52.654
I'm not, I'm

57:41.937 --> 57:52.654
playing cards. Oh, um,

57:53.135 --> 58:07.759
two for Ty and Jack, you got more than one of those, 
right?

58:13.460 --> 58:24.841
No, I'm not calling

58:13.460 --> 58:24.841
you a liar. I'm just telling you you're stupid. 
Yes, I am calling you stupid. That was stupid.

58:33.657 --> 58:33.857
Huh? Because it's your turn. I think I did.

58:46.973 --> 58:49.977
I dread to model one day. I do too, it's a

58:49.997 --> 58:53.962
passion. Okay, y'all what? Y'all got 8 o'clock 
classes and me and Kaydon, y'all better not wake us

58:55.464 --> 58:58.208
up. We're going to. I'm going to tell y'all 
something gross. God, Jackie, you do and I smell a

59:01.672 --> 59:04.616
lot of shit out of you. I will, yeah, I am in the 
morning. I know, I'm too often grumpy. You are not.

59:11.385 --> 59:12.567
I am too in the morning. You are not. Once you get to 
know me. They're different.

59:20.653 --> 59:25.420
I can

59:20.653 --> 59:25.420
see. We grow at each other. Well, that's a lot. I 
hear them. I live with them. Do they not like me?

59:36.637 --> 59:40.703
What do you mean, the things I pick up from me? The 
things I pick up from Jackie. I'm a nice girl. All

59:46.964 --> 59:59.672
right,

59:46.964 --> 59:59.672
man. No, I'll just go out and find him. I want to hear 
some funky, victory-laden, pretty mama. Gonna

01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:11.324
take me by the hand, hand-tacky, by the hand, 
pretty mama. Gonna dance with you, baby, all night

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:15.571
long. What can I say, Rick?

01:00:23.523 --> 01:00:27.028
What can I say, Rick? I'm writing a letter. Tell 
him.
