00:01.803 --> 00:04.568
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Okay, can you hear me? The 
following interview is with Walt Coughlin,

00:08.334 --> 00:13.903
former member of the Secret Service, by Christie 
Winderly.

00:18.470 --> 00:22.056
All right, the first thing, what were the various 
states that you were in Vietnam? I had the

00:22.643 --> 00:25.008
opportunity on three occasions to go to Vietnam. 
The first would be in 1965. The second was the

00:27.853 --> 00:37.272
inauguration of President Tu and Vice President 
Ki, which I guess was 1966 from memory. Then one

00:37.773 --> 00:39.276
time after that in late 1967. Okay. What was your 
job over there? The reason I was there, I was not in

00:44.665 --> 00:47.469
the military at the time. I was there on all three 
occasions with Vice President Humphrey, who was

00:48.110 --> 00:55.041
sent there on a political mission by his 
president, President Johnson. And my mission

00:55.241 --> 01:00.970
there was a member of the Secret Service to protect 
Mr. Humphrey. Were there any particular ways in

01:01.591 --> 01:05.778
which you carried out this protection? Any things 
that were different in Vietnam than they were

01:05.818 --> 01:09.604
ever? Well, obviously, it was a lot of different 
because there was a war going on, and there was an

01:09.624 --> 01:13.510
element of risk involved. But the thing we tried to 
do was work within the confines of the military

01:13.550 --> 01:17.536
operations. And through that, we would... which 
work our security by no one ever knew which

01:19.259 --> 01:46.802
helicopter he was in we take off in different 
directions and just the element of surprise with

01:19.259 --> 01:46.802
no schedule and we maintain codes and our radios 
and so on so we worked within the confines of the

01:19.259 --> 01:46.802
military in a very secret manner but it was still a 
very risky operation okay why did you decide to

01:19.259 --> 01:46.802
join the secret service couldn't get another job 
no that's not true um uh when i got out of college i uh

01:47.373 --> 01:54.582
really probably in retrospect would like to go to 
law school I guess but I didn't have any money so I

01:47.373 --> 01:54.582
had to get a job and I had friends that were in the fbi 
and i they were talking to me about some of the

01:55.692 --> 02:22.662
restraints that mr hoover at the time put on them 
and i didn't think i was kind of a free spirit in some

01:55.692 --> 02:22.662
of those things and i didn't think i would have 
lasted probably and then i heard about the secret

01:55.692 --> 02:22.662
service which i was not familiar with and the 
appeal of the white house and the travel and so on

01:55.692 --> 02:22.662
just it really appealed to me so i applied and i was 
fortunate enough to be uh to be uh selected

01:55.692 --> 02:22.662
okay um What were some of the precautions the 
Secret Service had to take in protecting the

02:23.620 --> 02:28.817
President and the Vice President? MR. You mean 
domestically or internationally or in Vietnam or

02:29.178 --> 02:32.449
just in general? in Vietnam and in the United 
States pertaining to Vietnam, such as in the

02:32.530 --> 02:38.101
demonstrations? Well, basically, in the earlier 
question, I think we pretty much covered what we

02:38.121 --> 02:42.570
did in Vietnam. We worked in the confines of the 
military, and the element of surprise, and we wore

02:42.590 --> 02:50.146
the bulletproof vests and all that type of thing 
that you would do in a combat zone normally. We kind

02:50.526 --> 02:53.813
of acted more like soldiers, frankly. But from the 
standpoint of general protection, the policy of

02:53.793 --> 03:02.949
the Secret Service protection of the president is 
organization, scheduling, logistics. And

03:03.470 --> 03:07.997
within all the confines of a smooth operation, you 
hopefully have real good security. You have good

03:08.598 --> 03:10.722
intelligence gathering. good communications 
between different police organizations,

03:10.702 --> 03:26.720
motorcade routes and intersection control and 
ticket control and access control and ushers and

03:10.702 --> 03:26.720
everything right down to where everyone sits and 
when they're supposed to be in their seat. All that

03:27.040 --> 03:29.263
comes under the umbrella of good security. So 
basically what you do as a Secret Service agent is

03:29.743 --> 03:37.772
try to organize as best you can down to a scheduled 
minute, sometimes to the second. particularly

03:37.752 --> 03:39.074
for television purposes. And under that umbrella 
of organization comes, hopefully, good

03:39.675 --> 03:47.689
security.

03:47.930 --> 03:51.235
What were some of the technological developments 
at the time? As a result of Vietnam? As a result of

03:53.439 --> 03:56.725
Vietnam and the protection that you had? Well, the 
technological developments even today... The

04:01.141 --> 04:07.571
state of the art of technology in every field is 
just between computers and radios and chips and

04:01.141 --> 04:07.571
microchips and everything else. Every day it 
changes and improves. One thing that did come out

04:10.015 --> 04:15.644
of Vietnam that I thought was worthwhile was some 
of the things that we used within the Secret

04:10.015 --> 04:15.644
Service. There was improvement in bulletproof 
vests and armament. There were improvements made

04:19.449 --> 04:22.594
in ballistics. There were improvements made in 
weapons. There were improvements made in things

04:25.272 --> 04:34.083
like I talked to you about earlier, about night 
vision glasses, where it's kind of an infrared

04:25.272 --> 04:34.083
type of glasses you put on. You can see as clear at 
night as you can in the daytime. So some of the

04:36.607 --> 04:43.575
technology that came out of Vietnam from a 
standpoint of security were excellent

04:36.607 --> 04:43.575
improvements. Okay. What sort of intelligence 
were we gaining in Vietnam? You mean we, the Secret

04:52.492 --> 04:56.397
Service, or we, the American people? We, the 
American people, and we, the Secret Service.

05:00.201 --> 05:01.683
Maybe you can define the difference. I'm not sure 
that, in retrospect, again, that our

05:01.943 --> 05:06.028
intelligence in Vietnam was very good. You know, 
the Tet Offensive, obviously, someone missed the

05:07.270 --> 05:09.432
boat. You know, we kept hearing numbers that were 
not accurate. I don't, for whatever reason, I

05:14.679 --> 05:17.402
guess you can argue both sides of that. I'm not 
convinced that our intelligence apparatus in

05:17.922 --> 05:24.952
Vietnam was effective at all. I knew a lot of CIA 
guys that were there, and they were really

05:25.994 --> 05:28.918
frustrated by it all. Because you were dealing 
with the Asiatic mind, which in and of itself seems

05:29.519 --> 05:39.513
to be rather secretive.

05:40.154 --> 05:44.841
Even some of the South Vietnamese forces were 
sympathetic. to the north, and you never really

05:44.821 --> 05:47.063
knew who your friends were. So I guess from that 
standpoint, the intelligence gathering was less

05:47.824 --> 05:52.147
than adequate. And frankly, I think it was very 
poor. OK. I was going to go on to ask if it was used

05:58.273 --> 06:01.836
effectively. Do you think that we gained anything 
worthwhile that could have been used effectively

06:03.758 --> 06:09.543
that was or was not? Or do you think that that 
question is really? Well, if there was something

06:15.635 --> 06:18.157
that was gained that could have been used 
effectively, I certainly don't remember. And

06:18.177 --> 06:22.301
that's not to say there wasn't, but I can't come up 
with one off the top of my head. Okay. What was your

06:25.524 --> 06:33.872
opinion of the war before going over for the first 
time, before you'd ever been in Vietnam? Probably

06:34.152 --> 06:40.778
that of most Americans, that we wouldn't be there 
if we weren't right, and I'm a patriot, and I just

06:34.152 --> 06:40.778
assumed that was the case. That was my going in. Did 
your opinion change at all? And if so, how and why?

06:49.226 --> 06:51.248
If not, was it strengthened? No, I think my opinion 
eventually changed. It wasn't right away. The

06:55.553 --> 07:01.521
more I observed the South Vietnamese, the more I 
wasn't sure that they really cared in a lot of ways.

07:01.941 --> 07:06.226
They said all the right things and did all the right 
things, but the fact is that they're very passive

07:01.941 --> 07:06.226
people. I'm not sure what their educational 
levels were, but they didn't appear to be very high

07:07.328 --> 07:10.752
to me. And it just seemed to me there were so many of 
them sympathetic to the North that, and talking to

07:11.305 --> 07:28.217
our troops over there, I'm not sure that they knew 
exactly sometimes where the loyalties lied of the

07:11.305 --> 07:28.217
Arvin people. So I think that's probably what 
changed my opinion more than anything else, that

07:28.957 --> 07:37.748
in retrospect, we probably, I think we went in 
there with good intentions. I think we got bogged

07:37.968 --> 07:42.074
down in a land war in Asia, which history has told us 
never to do. And then it got so political towards

07:43.275 --> 07:49.223
the end that all those mistakes just constituted 
our downfall. The Americans are very impatient

07:50.264 --> 07:52.787
people. And the thing is that the Asiatics, you 
know, time means nothing to them, and they'll

07:53.510 --> 07:59.161
out-weight you. They did that to the French at Dien 
Pin Pew, and they did it to the Americans too. You

08:04.812 --> 08:08.720
made the statement that in the end it got to be very 
political. Are you talking politically? in the

08:11.060 --> 08:12.942
United States? Yeah, yes. Well, probably in 
Vietnam too, but I'm not familiar with the Vietnam

08:14.143 --> 08:19.509
politics, basically. In the United States, it got 
to be very political because of the

08:20.010 --> 08:23.814
demonstrations. The media, I think, turned 
sympathetic towards the demonstrators. They

08:28.719 --> 08:29.780
turned anti. I think President Johnson backed 
himself into a corner that he couldn't get out of.

08:34.305 --> 08:40.932
And well, it was obvious that he did, because 
that's why he couldn't run for president in 1968.

08:42.852 --> 08:53.426
You mentioned the morale of the troops, or 
actually the idea, the perceptions of the troops

08:42.852 --> 08:53.426
as to who Arvin, which side Arvin was on. What was 
the overall morale of the troops? Frustration, I

08:57.892 --> 08:59.053
think. I think they felt hamstrung for political 
reasons. That's the way they interpreted what was

09:04.600 --> 09:07.364
going on. I think they... If they have a war to 
fight, let's go fight it. There's no such thing as a

09:12.958 --> 09:15.843
nice war. So why try to be nice? If you're going to 
fight a war, let's fight it, let's win it, and get

09:19.309 --> 09:21.653
the hell out of here. That was kind of their 
attitude. But they won't let us do that. And we're

09:24.257 --> 09:26.501
over here getting killed, and no one knows what's 
going on. And we read about what's going on in the

09:26.521 --> 09:29.205
United States. What's it all about? Were there any 
geographically based differences that you were

09:31.874 --> 09:35.961
aware of? We've heard that the people who were up 
close fighting with the National Vietnamese

09:36.782 --> 09:55.131
Army, that a lot of times they were fighting on a 
more conventional sense, whereas the people down

09:36.782 --> 09:55.131
in the Mekong Delta were fighting more guerrilla 
warfare. Well, yeah, there was some of that, but I

09:55.651 --> 09:59.775
think mostly it was a guerrilla warfare. I think 
the American forces, with all their equipment,

10:00.636 --> 10:06.863
all their training, just were not capable of 
handling the guerrilla warfare. And another

10:07.724 --> 10:18.756
thing is I've had guys tell me that they would be 
holding a base camp and be overrun by the Viet Cong,

10:07.724 --> 10:18.756
and instead of the Arvin forces taking the wall, to 
defend, they would just kind of cowl in the corner,

10:18.871 --> 10:35.538
and the American forces would go to the wall, and 
then all of a sudden they'd all be shot in the back by

10:18.871 --> 10:35.538
the Arvin forces, because they just, you know, 
they would be your friend until it looked like it

10:18.871 --> 10:35.538
wasn't going to go their way, and then all of a 
sudden they were, you were the bad guy. So the

10:36.158 --> 10:38.382
American forces were very frustrated by that. In a 
sense of the South Vietnamese people, and Arvin in

10:39.492 --> 10:59.722
particular, do you think it was a matter of them 
actually being on the side of the Viet Cong and the

10:39.492 --> 10:59.722
North Vietnamese, or do you think it was more a 
sense of survival, that they really didn't much

10:39.492 --> 10:59.722
care philosophically? I think the rank and file, 
which is probably what you're referring to, the

10:59.943 --> 11:08.976
peasants, which is basically what the country is, 
they probably didn't really know much about it or

10:59.943 --> 11:08.976
care, frankly. They just wanted to be left alone 
and grow their rice and stop all this foolishness.

11:14.652 --> 11:14.973
Okay. They're probably no better off today than 
they would have been if we'd have won, or no worse

11:14.993 --> 11:21.001
off.

11:21.382 --> 11:27.169
Could you describe any of the changes that the 
morale of the troops might have gone through as the

11:21.382 --> 11:27.169
years went by? Well, I think it was no different 
than the opinion of our country. I think the troops

11:32.957 --> 11:37.343
eventually started saying, you know, why are we 
here? No one will let us do what we have to do. If

11:40.228 --> 11:43.312
indeed we're going to win this thing, let's go win 
it. Don't tell us what line we have to stop at or

11:43.332 --> 11:49.521
don't tell us who we can't bomb or when we can't 
shoot somebody. If you're in a war, it's in a war.

11:52.065 --> 11:54.248
But the troops got very frustrated by that. Okay. 
What knowledge did you have of Vietnam before

11:57.873 --> 12:04.543
going over there in a sense geographically, 
culturally, and militarily? None whatsoever.

12:06.466 --> 12:08.369
Okay. What would you say our goals were in Vietnam? 
Well, you know, the published goal was that we

12:12.415 --> 12:15.760
wanted to stop the... There was a domino theory of 
communist aggression through Asia. And whether

12:19.446 --> 12:24.854
that's right or wrong or not, that was the reason we 
were in there, was to stop the communist

12:19.446 --> 12:24.854
aggression against the South. And then, you know, 
the domino theory being next was Thailand and

12:25.756 --> 12:30.583
next, you know, Malaysia. Well, we obviously lost 
the war, but Thailand is still not overrun.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.317
Cambodia, of course, or Laos, is gone. But I'm not 
sure that history won't show us that we might be

12:38.958 --> 12:43.665
right. Maybe we did prevent the domino theory. I 
don't know. Do you think that we followed a plan

12:48.753 --> 12:53.601
strategically structured to achieve this goal? 
No, I think what probably eventually happened was

12:54.239 --> 13:11.995
with all the demonstrations and so on, the 
anti-Vietnam feelings, I feel that Johnson, who

12:54.239 --> 13:11.995
tended to be very egotistical, I guess, for lack of 
a better word, very proud man, He's a great

13:12.413 --> 13:14.537
patriot, really. But the thing is, I just feel that 
he was determined to get this thing through, and I

13:15.038 --> 13:23.773
think it just wore him down. I forget what your 
question is. I started rambling there. Just the

13:26.418 --> 13:28.501
strategic structure. So strategically, I think 
that Johnson and maybe even the military, because

13:29.062 --> 13:37.577
he as commander-in-chief runs the military, ran 
the military, I think that they forgot what their

13:38.232 --> 13:44.319
mission was and got the politics involved in it, 
and they were worried about reelection and so on.

13:44.339 --> 13:45.140
Everything just went to hell. Do you think that the 
American military was overconfident in its

13:47.062 --> 13:58.134
approach to Vietnam before Tet? Before Tet, I 
think they were, you know, I still think that they

13:58.154 --> 14:05.282
feel they could have won it if they'd been allowed 
to use all their artillery, so to speak. Mm-hmm.

14:05.722 --> 14:10.969
But they were really, they were hamstrung, and 
they had never fought a guerrilla war before. And

14:10.989 --> 14:12.731
it was a very frustrating war. We have a friend of 
ours who was a forward observer, and he said he laid

14:14.354 --> 14:25.328
for two days as a forward observer observing a rice 
paddy, because they had to cross that rice paddy,

14:14.354 --> 14:25.328
and he never saw a movement. So he called his 
platoon to cross the rice paddy, and they were all

14:26.069 --> 14:29.514
killed. Laying underneath the rice paddy, 
breathing through reeds, were Viet Congs. And

14:35.067 --> 14:39.471
they'd been there the 48 hours he was there, and God 
knows how long before that. And they just wiped out

14:40.211 --> 14:42.293
his whole platoon. And he said they were just 
covered with leeches. So you talk about patience

14:45.256 --> 14:47.858
and frustration. That's a war that we had never 
known before.

14:55.164 --> 14:59.308
What, if anything, should we have done 
differently as far as the war was concerned? Well,

14:59.688 --> 15:01.790
if you wanted to win the war, you should have won it, 
I think. And probably the best way to do that would

15:01.870 --> 15:04.332
have been... I don't know if you could have bombed 
them back to the Stone Ages, as General LeMay said,

15:04.885 --> 15:12.453
but I guess that's probably what would have 
happened. That certainly would have, if they

15:13.715 --> 15:21.383
wiped them off the face of the earth, you would have 
either, you know, for whatever reason, you know,

15:13.715 --> 15:21.383
as I say, war is a nasty thing. And there's no nice 
way to win a war. But I think if we went in there and we

15:24.246 --> 15:26.669
intended to win it, we should have won it. And the 
only way you're going to do is bomb them back to the

15:26.909 --> 15:30.953
Stone Age, like Curtis LeMay suggested. And he was 
an Air Force general. He should know something

15:32.355 --> 15:34.437
about it. um could you give me a general comparison 
of your perceptions at the various times that you

15:35.243 --> 16:04.693
were there how they might have changed my 
perceptions right your perceptions just your

15:35.243 --> 16:04.693
ideas i i think i probably alluded to them in the 
conversation so far you know each time i went back i

15:35.243 --> 16:04.693
kind of got more frustrated by it all too you know 
you hear the same things you just i saw guys maimed

15:35.243 --> 16:04.693
by booby traps and you know legs blown off and eyes 
blown out from concussion grenades and And it was

16:04.758 --> 16:07.942
just, you know, it was a very frustrating thing. We 
were trying to fight a war with all this elaborate

16:08.282 --> 16:17.895
equipment, and they're out there with sticks and 
stones, and it was just a frustrating thing. And I

16:18.435 --> 16:27.246
guess the thing that probably turned me against 
him more than anything else was I got the

16:18.435 --> 16:27.246
impression, and I could well be wrong, but it's my 
impression, that the South Vietnamese didn't

16:18.435 --> 16:27.246
really care. The rank and file, the peasants, I 
mean. I don't know about the government. What

16:34.559 --> 16:45.173
political reaction did you see concerning the My 
Lime Massacre in March of 1968 under the command of

16:34.559 --> 16:45.173
Lieutenant Calley? It's interesting you ask that 
because the same person I referred to earlier, who

16:45.193 --> 16:56.769
laid there for 48 hours waiting to cross the rice 
paddy, later on was in Calley's platoon when that

16:45.193 --> 16:56.769
happened. And the reason it happened, and few 
people know this, in fact I've never seen it in

16:56.789 --> 17:01.275
print, And I know this is true because the person 
who told me was there, and he doesn't have a

17:01.930 --> 17:08.539
tendency to exaggerate or no reason for him to lie 
about it. What it was, every day or every week or

17:09.240 --> 17:28.446
whatever it was, they would take these trucks and 
all through My Lai, and Cali was their commander,

17:09.240 --> 17:28.446
and they would stop like GIs tend to do and give the 
kids chocolates and cigarettes and all that type

17:09.240 --> 17:28.446
of stuff and just kind of have a little picnic. 
Well, then they get down the road, three or four or

17:30.972 --> 17:35.918
five or ten miles, and all the trucks would start 
blowing up for no apparent reason. And people were

17:36.939 --> 17:38.161
getting killed. I mean, all of them, you know, they 
were getting wiped out. Well, what they found out

17:41.024 --> 17:52.298
was that when they were stopping, these little 
kids in My Lai, and the sympathetic people, their

17:41.024 --> 17:52.298
parents or whatever, they were taking all the 
chocolate candies. When they weren't looking,

17:52.578 --> 18:00.388
what they were doing was pulling pins from hand 
grenades and wrapping a rubber band around the

17:52.578 --> 18:00.388
hand grenade and dropping it in the gas tank of the 
truck. the same people you're being nice to. And

18:04.009 --> 18:09.014
then when you get down the road, of course, the 
gasoline would erode that rubber band, and up you

18:04.009 --> 18:09.014
go. Well, the reaction of the people that have been 
getting their people killed was to go back and take

18:09.914 --> 18:21.164
care of the source that was causing this to happen, 
which were the My Lai kids and families. And that's

18:21.185 --> 18:23.587
where the My Lai massacre came from, and that's why 
it happened. And frankly, as a person, if you're

18:24.768 --> 18:30.713
really going to analyze war, I feel sorry for Cali. 
He did exactly what he had to do. Okay. My next

18:35.295 --> 18:39.200
question then was going to be your opinion of 
Lieutenant Calley as a commander. I take it that

18:39.220 --> 18:42.244
you think that... I don't know how many people he 
lost, but there were trucks. They couldn't figure

18:45.289 --> 18:47.612
out for several weeks what was going on. So he lost 
several truckloads of troops by these same

18:47.672 --> 18:52.339
people. And as I say, war is ugly. So he went back and 
he bit off the hand that was doing it. All right.

19:01.591 --> 19:06.877
What is your opinion of the manner in which the 
trial of Lieutenant Calley was handled,

19:01.591 --> 19:06.877
especially the publicity? Well, I think what I 
just said you've never seen in print, and I'm

19:08.318 --> 19:14.345
convinced in my heart that it's true because the 
person who told me was there. But you'll never see

19:15.306 --> 19:18.930
in print that they had any excuse to do what they 
did. It's kind of like now you're reading about,

19:19.591 --> 19:26.038
oh, terrible President Reagan killing that 
little kid in Libya. Well, what about the kid that

19:26.618 --> 19:29.121
was sucked through the TWA plane? No one ever talks 
about that when they... when the Libyans bombed

19:31.088 --> 19:32.109
it. So, as I say, there's no nice answer to it. 
That's just the price you pay for war and for

19:36.254 --> 19:40.840
terrorism. Besides, what the hell... An adult's 
life is just as valuable as a kid's. It's just a

19:47.748 --> 19:49.751
sentiment that people seem to have. Do you 
think... What sort of reason do you think there is

19:51.353 --> 19:59.863
that the media would not be showing things from 
that point of view? I can't speak for the media.

20:03.415 --> 20:05.498
They still don't, in my opinion. They show things 
that are, first of all, going to create interest,

20:05.798 --> 20:10.305
and secondly, sell newspapers. And the My Lai 
thing, no one can, I guess, morally go around

20:10.846 --> 20:20.620
saying, well, Lieutenant Kelly was wrong for 
killing kids. But the thing is, some of the Viet

20:21.359 --> 20:25.265
Cong forces were 11 and 12 years old, too. Are they 
kids just because they're soldiers? What the

20:27.047 --> 20:28.089
hell's the difference? If they're killing your 
people and it's a war, then you have to annihilate

20:28.109 --> 20:31.234
them. Age is not a factor, I don't think. Do you 
think Lieutenant Calley was used as a scapegoat

20:37.543 --> 20:42.951
for the American people and for the military? Yes, 
but I can't give any reasons why. I mean, it's my

20:45.795 --> 20:47.839
opinion that he was. I think it's a shame that of all 
the tragedies and all the all the horrible things

20:51.312 --> 21:16.898
that happen in vietnam being single out one person 
to uh to be tried and convicted i mean i guess you you

20:51.312 --> 21:16.898
could do the same thing to every pilot that dropped 
napalm and burned some little girl or some little

20:51.312 --> 21:16.898
kid that never happened that was accepted as being 
part of war tragic though it is i yeah i think kelly

20:51.312 --> 21:16.898
was escaping i sure do um

21:20.152 --> 21:24.697
You've somewhat answered this question, but I'm 
going to go ahead and answer it again, or ask it

21:20.152 --> 21:24.697
again. What role did it appear to you that the media 
played? What's your opinion of that role? And what

21:29.583 --> 21:32.947
effects, if any, do you think that the media had on 
the war? Oh, they had all the effect on the war.

21:35.570 --> 21:39.375
That's the first time ever that the American 
public saw killing on live TV. We saw the war in our

21:40.917 --> 21:42.278
living room. That's why it was so controversial. 
The media, and I'm not saying it's right or wrong,

21:44.806 --> 21:53.957
that's just the way that television is today, but 
that's the first time the American people ever had

21:44.806 --> 21:53.957
war in their living room. They saw it, they had 
strong opinions for it, or against it for the most

21:54.478 --> 22:04.930
part, because as I say, first of all, they're not 
trained for war, soldiers are trained for war, and

21:54.478 --> 22:04.930
they're not used to seeing this carnage. And they 
did turn against it, and the media had a tremendous

22:05.911 --> 22:09.936
amount to do with it. Could you give me your 
perceptions of the domestic demonstrations? In

22:17.207 --> 22:23.942
particular,

22:17.207 --> 22:23.942
what was your role during the domestic 
demonstrations? How did they change over the

22:24.277 --> 22:26.160
years? What effect did they have on the 
government? How did they affect the President in

22:29.725 --> 22:34.553
his personal life also? And what effect did they 
have on political policies? THE PRESIDENT. Well,

22:39.620 --> 22:42.805
you might have to – I might have to ask you again some 
of those things. But basically, first of all, they

22:42.825 --> 22:48.854
started out as a very small group, and then they 
just grew and grew and grew. And some of this was

22:48.875 --> 22:51.178
from the media. And they were strong. For the most 
part, they were young kids who chose not to go to

22:53.105 --> 23:01.135
Vietnam for whatever reason or were opposed to it 
politically and philosophically. But the thing

23:02.537 --> 23:11.568
was that they got larger as the war went on and they 
got more militant to where they became very

23:02.537 --> 23:11.568
destructive. I mean, I saw times when I was in the 
middle of these people with Humphrey One time at

23:16.538 --> 23:22.705
Stanford, they got so bad that, frankly, they were 
worse than anything I ever saw in Vietnam. These

23:23.746 --> 23:25.228
same peaceniks, so to speak. And the fact is that 
they were not that way at all. They were very, very

23:28.792 --> 23:30.755
militant people. But I have to give them the 
benefit of the doubt and say they were speaking

23:32.617 --> 23:36.381
their conscience. I don't know that they were. I 
think some of them are out there just for a lark. I

23:39.385 --> 23:41.507
think there's some communist infiltration in it, 
frankly. I think there's some anti-American

23:41.948 --> 23:43.730
infiltration in it. The media gave a complete 
coverage. And the more coverage they got, it's no

23:46.272 --> 23:49.155
different than terrorism. You know, I think it 
would probably, the reason terrorists do what

23:49.215 --> 23:54.721
they do is to get coverage and get sympathy of the 
world. And that's what the Vietnam demonstrators

23:55.181 --> 23:56.643
do. As far as my role, and I was in it every day with 
Humphrey, and it was very difficult, frankly. We

24:01.308 --> 24:03.590
were spit on and kicked and everything else every 
day. So it was very difficult. Now, I specify that

24:05.372 --> 24:12.359
it was Humphrey because Johnson, they got so bad, 
he was a prisoner of the White House. He could not go

24:12.379 --> 24:14.862
out. And that's why he couldn't run for president 
in 1968. It wasn't that he didn't want to. He

24:20.128 --> 24:20.629
couldn't. He could not fiscally campaign. They 
would have kept him off the streets. And that's why

24:24.874 --> 24:27.897
he chose not to run again. So, yeah, did they set 
political policy? You bet your life they did. They

24:30.540 --> 24:34.624
made Richard Nixon president.

24:35.385 --> 24:41.592
A lot of times it's been stated by a number of people 
that the first... I guess militant act was by the

24:42.753 --> 24:48.460
United States at Kent State in particular. What do 
you think about that? Do you think it was a reaction

24:50.222 --> 24:59.292
of the United States government against the 
demonstrators? Do you think it was just people got

24:59.312 --> 25:05.419
caught up in what was going on and maybe made some 
decisions that might not have been the best? I

25:05.520 --> 25:11.967
think when it all started out, there were very 
sincere kids at Kent State, and I say kids for like

25:05.520 --> 25:11.967
students, It's not all more students. Some of them 
were runaways and some were renegades. But for the

25:15.301 --> 25:25.993
most part, they were a group of students who were 
anti-Vietnam and were showing their

25:15.301 --> 25:25.993
constitutional right to protest. And like all 
these things, they tend to get out of hand. This one

25:28.456 --> 25:29.076
did. The National Guard was called out for 
whatever reason. They were called out. And then,

25:33.702 --> 25:39.788
if you know anything about National Guard, for the 
most part, they're young guys, too, who've never

25:33.702 --> 25:39.788
had any formal training. They go one weekend a 
month. And when it got violent, my guess is, and

25:41.765 --> 25:53.979
this is only a guess, that someone somewhere gave 
the order to fire and a bunch of nervous kids called

25:41.765 --> 25:53.979
National Guard soldiers fired. And they killed 
some people. I think it was a misunderstanding on

25:56.441 --> 25:58.263
both sides. I think it was a tragedy on both sides. 
It was something that started out very

26:00.686 --> 26:04.110
well-meaning and got out of hand, and people died. 
What was Two's government like? You said that you

26:10.925 --> 26:12.667
were there for the inauguration. Maybe you can 
just give me your perceptions of the inauguration

26:12.707 --> 26:16.872
and then any knowledge. I really don't know what 
his government was like. I really don't. I know Key

26:20.496 --> 26:21.798
was his vice president. He was kind of a flamboyant 
guy. Two, the observations I made, was a very, very

26:23.380 --> 26:31.690
sincere, interested, anti-communist man. Now, 
how he got to where he is, I don't know the history of

26:31.790 --> 26:35.194
Two. uh... whether the election was fair i don't 
know i do know that he tried to run a democratic type

26:35.663 --> 27:03.240
of government and as you know he now lives in 
connecticut or somewhere he didn't do very well

26:35.663 --> 27:03.240
with it and two lives in california or key rather so 
for whatever i i i really don't know what kind of

26:35.663 --> 27:03.240
government he ran it was quasi military obviously 
but uh... whether he was elected legally i you know

27:03.423 --> 27:05.265
It could be another Marcos deal for all I know. I 
really don't know. Okay.

27:10.432 --> 27:12.995
What was your opinion of the South Vietnamese 
people? I found them to be very, for the most part,

27:14.677 --> 27:24.068
peasant, for the most part, passive, for the most 
part, probably uninformed.

27:26.331 --> 27:31.978
They just wanted to grow rice and have babies and be 
left alone. But, and again, that's only, that's my

27:32.549 --> 27:37.034
perception of them. The military, I think it was 
all by conscription. And they got in the military

27:41.158 --> 27:46.703
and they were trained and they were told to go fight 
your brothers in the north. And some did and some

27:46.723 --> 27:48.065
didn't. But for the most part, I found them a very 
patient Asiatic

27:48.706 --> 27:57.655
people.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.957
What was your opinion of Arvin? I don't have very 
high regard for them, frankly. And again, I

28:03.826 --> 28:08.313
alluded earlier to times when they've turned on 
our forces. They would run in times of crises.

28:15.744 --> 28:19.450
I've had both the South Korean forces and the 
American forces tell me they're not worth a darn.

28:21.313 --> 28:23.637
The best forces I saw there, frankly, were the 
South Koreans. A number of people have said that.

28:26.281 --> 28:29.826
The ROK, they call them the ROK forces, Republic of 
Korea. And again, they were trained by us from

28:30.177 --> 28:32.040
Korea. They weren't very good in Korea in 1950 
either, but they're certainly good now.

28:39.392 --> 28:42.757
What was your opinion of the South Vietnamese 
Secret Service? Did you cooperate with them? Did

28:45.762 --> 28:47.344
they cooperate with you? I never knew they had a 
Secret Service per se. I'm sure it was part of their

28:49.488 --> 28:52.713
infrastructure of their military. But any time we 
were there, we always dealt strictly with the

28:53.554 --> 28:57.180
military. And now if the guy wearing the uniform 
was Secret Service, I didn't know that. I didn't

29:00.758 --> 29:01.319
ask. I didn't care. So again, I have no opinion. I 
don't even know if they have a thing called the

29:05.923 --> 29:07.645
Secret Service. You say they did, they did. Okay.

29:13.531 --> 29:19.877
How much did... Well, I guess this would be a 
difficult question for you to answer. I was going

29:19.937 --> 29:22.039
to say, how much did you spy on each other? But if you 
really weren't aware of the South Vietnam Secret

29:22.119 --> 29:26.003
Service, then... I mean, we had no reason to spy on 
anyone. We were there for anywhere from five days

29:28.082 --> 29:33.249
to eight days, and we tried to stay alive and get the 
heck out of there. I think I'm talking more in terms

29:33.590 --> 29:39.077
of maybe just militarily. Well, you know, we were, 
again, working within the confines of the

29:39.658 --> 29:43.243
American military. The things we were very 
careful with was our radio transmission because

29:43.583 --> 29:48.150
we knew they were probably being monitored. But 
that's true in every foreign country. You know, we

29:50.052 --> 29:51.975
never say anything over the telephone. We didn't 
want the world to know. But that's true of any

29:53.397 --> 29:55.720
foreign country. There's really nothing 
different there that we did that you wouldn't do if

29:56.307 --> 30:01.912
you were visiting today to France.

30:04.835 --> 30:05.015
Okay. The only difference is people should 
mention it. Nice difference. Were you aware of any

30:10.601 --> 30:16.627
corruption within the government, Arvin, or the 
Secret Service? If so... I'm sure that there was so

30:19.129 --> 30:25.015
much money going into and aid going into South 
Vietnam I'm sure there was corruption involved.

30:27.169 --> 30:30.454
I'm sure there was money that never got to where it 
was supposed to go. I didn't see a lot of it. I used to

30:34.240 --> 30:37.144
see Key with a lot of $5 bills in his pocket at times. 
But

30:37.765 --> 30:45.397
I don't think it's any different than any other 
dictatorial type of government. And what the heck

30:45.517 --> 30:50.024
it was that, you know, Marcus, look at all the aid we 
gave Marcus. Now look what he's done with it,

30:50.064 --> 30:51.466
apparently. I'm sure some of that went on in 
Vietnam. Not all that went for milk and honey was

30:54.678 --> 30:59.840
spent on milk and honey, I'm sure. They went in 
somebody's pocket. I didn't really see it, but I

31:03.672 --> 31:08.660
heard it from people who should know that it was a 
substantial amount of it. But my lord, I don't know

31:08.961 --> 31:14.250
how many million dollars a day of aid the United 
States were sending to Vietnam. You probably

31:14.270 --> 31:15.031
know. But, you know, it was just mind-boggling, 
the money going in there. What was it, a million

31:21.181 --> 31:23.165
dollars a day we spent in Vietnam? Something like 
that. And if you get a few people that have sticky

31:25.795 --> 31:35.848
fingers, you've got a million dollars a day coming 
in every day, and they only want to steal $10,000 a

31:25.795 --> 31:35.848
day, that's not very much out of a million, but if 
you steal $10,000 every day, that's a hell of a lot.

31:36.749 --> 31:38.191
Yeah, I think there's a lot of corruption, 
frankly.

31:42.777 --> 31:45.801
Could you give me your perceptions on the 
following people? First of all, Humphrey.

31:48.945 --> 31:54.672
Humphrey was probably one of the brightest, most 
well-read patriots I've ever met in my life. He was

31:55.394 --> 31:57.216
a true American. Politically, I wasn't in full 
agreement with him. I professed to be a

32:02.823 --> 32:04.865
conservative. He professed to be a liberal. I'm 
not sure I know what those two things mean. So we had

32:09.110 --> 32:11.153
different philosophies of politics. But I will 
say this about him. He's the only true liberal I

32:14.237 --> 32:15.618
ever met. Most liberals, they scream for busing 
and put their kids in private schools. Humphrey

32:22.026 --> 32:22.887
didn't do that. He used to say that he firmly 
believed that all men are created equal in the eyes

32:23.288 --> 32:26.913
of God. He used to say that he never could 
understand why it took 50,000 laws to govern 10

32:27.994 --> 32:34.863
commandments. Well, and that's a very 
commendable statement. Maybe naive, but it's

32:37.966 --> 32:39.909
commendable. But that's really the way he was. He 
was a very gentle man, a very bright man, and I feel

32:41.631 --> 32:45.576
would have made a good president. I think what he 
did, because of the television today, um he came

32:50.761 --> 33:16.870
across to the american public as being weak as a 
weak person the fact is he was a very kind and gentle

32:50.761 --> 33:16.870
person and i think they mistook that kind and 
gentle characteristic as being a weak person i

32:50.761 --> 33:16.870
think if humphrey would have been running for 
president prior to the television era he may well

32:50.761 --> 33:16.870
have won it he was not for some reason now you have to 
be attractive to be president or whatever the word

33:16.985 --> 33:20.770
is they use, charisma, whatever the hell that 
means. A lot of people have stated that. It doesn't

33:22.613 --> 33:23.394
make any sense. Charisma does nothing for you. In 
fact, I've heard it say that Humphrey had a very

33:27.039 --> 33:29.182
high forehead. And I heard a guy tell him one time, 
Hubert, on television, you look like a

33:30.063 --> 33:33.948
hydrocephalic. Well, it wasn't a very nice thing 
to say, but he probably did. I think, and getting

33:40.745 --> 33:47.576
back to your media question, yeah, I think the 
media does a lot to influence politics today and

33:40.745 --> 33:47.576
not all of it's good.

33:52.744 --> 33:54.887
Okay, what were your perceptions of Johnson? 
Johnson was a very strong man, a very proud man, a

33:55.408 --> 34:01.858
very well-versed political expert. He 
understood all the workings of politics. He

34:05.909 --> 34:11.498
understood the American system to a T. He started 
from the bottom and went to the top through the

34:05.909 --> 34:11.498
political system of this country. He knew all the 
soft spots in people. He understood human needs.

34:16.005 --> 34:19.109
He understood what made people do and don't do 
things. He was a master at it. I think the thing that

34:22.054 --> 34:29.365
brought Lyndon down, I call him Lyndon, President 
Johnson down, was his... his Texas tenacity, so to

34:30.492 --> 34:32.474
speak. And by golly, I'm always right. And he 
didn't listen to his advisors on Vietnam. And he

34:37.780 --> 34:42.325
just got so paranoid about it that it destroyed 
him.

34:46.289 --> 34:47.390
What about Westmoreland? I like Westmoreland. I 
thought he was a good commander. In fact, I have a

34:50.874 --> 34:56.440
picture out there with him if you'd like to see it 
before you leave. He was a good soldier, a very

34:58.142 --> 35:00.364
respected soldier. The troops liked him. He was 
always in the field with them. He was always in the

35:03.778 --> 35:05.001
front lines. Every time we went through hospitals 
in Vietnam, he was always there. The troops loved

35:09.650 --> 35:10.512
him. I think Westmoreland's problem was that when 
you get to be that high, when you get up with stars on

35:11.374 --> 35:19.230
your shoulders, then you become part of the 
political system. Because I think there are

35:19.818 --> 35:23.282
politics involved in everything, not least of 
which is the military. So he did have some

35:24.084 --> 35:26.547
political pressures put on him. I think as a 
soldier, he probably did some things or was forced

35:26.567 --> 35:34.137
to do some things that he didn't read in the book of 
Westmoreland. But I liked Westmoreland. I think

35:36.199 --> 35:40.605
he got caught up in the politics of it all, too, 
under the power of Lyndon Johnson, who was his

35:36.199 --> 35:40.605
boss.

35:44.470 --> 35:47.614
What about the LBJ administration in general? Oh, 
I think probably they're getting a lot of credit

35:49.805 --> 35:54.291
for things they shouldn't. What he did, the LBJ 
administration did nothing more than continue

35:55.092 --> 36:00.579
with the things that Kennedy started.

36:03.342 --> 36:11.693
Johnson got credit for a lot of things that I don't 
know, but it'd be my opinion that if he were elected

36:03.342 --> 36:11.693
president, he would not have done. I don't think he 
was a big firm advocate of civil rights,

36:12.834 --> 36:16.639
personally. although he was almost forced to be 
because Kennedy had already got those things, the

36:16.889 --> 36:25.141
Peace Corps and so on, in motion during his three 
years in office. So Johnson just carried those

36:25.161 --> 36:29.947
things on, which was politically a very 
intelligent thing to do. But I think the Johnson

36:30.748 --> 36:38.880
administration will go down in history, 
unfortunately, as a bad administration because

36:30.748 --> 36:38.880
of Vietnam. Vietnam destroyed him, and all the 
other things, I think, are second to none. And

36:46.015 --> 36:50.521
finally, what were your perceptions of Two? 
President Two? As I say, I only observed him. I

36:54.347 --> 36:55.969
never spoke a word to the man in my life. He 
seemed... I don't know where he came from. I don't

36:59.054 --> 37:00.235
know anything about his background. I don't know 
how he was elected. I think he was an honorable man,

37:02.018 --> 37:04.481
apparently.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.470
When I went to his inauguration in 66, he seemed to 
be... Very much accepted by the people. Of course,

37:13.012 --> 37:15.636
the people that were there to applaud him were 
probably his friends. I don't know. But I really

37:16.817 --> 37:22.886
don't have any in-depth opinions about two, 
frankly. And I apologize. That's fine. Are there

37:27.592 --> 37:34.442
any other things that you can think of that would be 
interesting to tell me or that you'd like to talk

37:27.592 --> 37:34.442
about? Well, I would hope we learn from it. I think 
the United States should have learned from it. I'm

37:38.345 --> 37:39.286
not sure we have. I see the same thing raising its 
ugly head in Honduras. If we're not careful, we're

37:41.809 --> 37:44.752
going to get the same thing down there. I don't know 
how you handle terrorism, and that's really what

37:45.192 --> 37:47.655
it was. The things that the Viet Cong did are 
incomprehensible to the American mind. The

37:56.104 --> 37:57.125
tunnels they dug. There are hospitals 
underground. Hospitals dug underground. Where

38:02.630 --> 38:03.531
did they put all the dirt? No one's ever seen the 
dirt yet. When they tunneled out, what were they

38:05.994 --> 38:07.896
doing with the dirt? I mean, they literally 
carried stuff for hundreds of miles on their back.

38:14.115 --> 38:17.758
And they're just a very ingenious, innovative 
people. And I think if we fought them for a thousand

38:18.519 --> 38:23.023
years, we'd never beat them because they just had 
wings. We couldn't live the way they live. Our guys

38:26.326 --> 38:31.590
can't live underneath a rice paddy with leeches in 
their body for a week. They can't live underground

38:32.171 --> 38:36.314
in tunnels for months and never come up. They're 
like rats. And I don't mean that disparagingly,

38:37.762 --> 38:40.969
but that's the way they, they live like animals. 
And there's, you know, if we learned anything, it

38:41.911 --> 38:52.994
was said before we ever got involved in Vietnam, 
but don't ever again get caught in a ground war in

38:41.911 --> 38:52.994
Asia, because they'll destroy you. The only way we 
ever beat the Japanese was to bomb them.

38:58.940 --> 39:04.987
Why do you think it is that they seem to have this 
ability to do these things? Do you think it was a

39:05.007 --> 39:11.574
fact of the way they had been raised culturally? 
Sure, it's part of their culture, yeah. No doubt

39:14.197 --> 39:15.298
about it. They're very, very patient people. They 
were very strong-willed people. They're very

39:23.487 --> 39:24.728
proud people. And, again, they just have a 
different framework on what's important. The

39:29.733 --> 39:32.597
Americans are very impatient. I mean, I just got 
back from North Yemen, which is the same way. Time

39:35.621 --> 39:37.463
means nothing to them. They show you a house 
they've lived in for 800 years. A family lived in

39:41.048 --> 39:42.890
the same house for 800 years. I mean, you can have a 
meeting with them at 3 o'clock this afternoon.

39:46.335 --> 39:48.698
They might show up next Sunday and think nothing of 
it. I mean, what's a week when you're talking about

39:49.159 --> 39:52.183
civilization? And that's kind of the way the 
North, the Vietnamese are. And the Asiatic mind is

39:55.150 --> 39:57.454
just that way. It's not quite like, you know, you 
tend to hear about the Mexican mind on mañana, you

39:59.037 --> 40:03.205
know. Well, tomorrow is not very far off. These 
people are talking in years. They're talking

40:06.671 --> 40:07.613
about decades. They're talking about centuries. 
Big difference. And we Americans will never

40:11.660 --> 40:14.626
comprehend that thinking. Never. How much 
importance would you place on the survival factor

40:17.813 --> 40:25.881
as far as their ability to do these things? Do you 
think that that was important, the fact that it was

40:25.921 --> 40:35.191
in their country and that they were fighting for 
their lives, or not necessarily just their lives,

40:25.921 --> 40:35.191
their home? Well, I guess there's some of that. I 
mean, I've never talked to a Viet Cong, but

40:36.732 --> 40:39.435
obviously they were dedicated. They were 
dedicated to something, be it Buddha or Ho Chi

40:39.575 --> 40:42.899
Minh. I don't know. But they were dedicated, and 
boy, they thought nothing about dying. I was in a

40:47.295 --> 40:51.740
hospital one day, an American hospital in the 
field with Humphrey, and Westmoreland was with

40:47.295 --> 40:51.740
us. And there were all these American troops in 
these cots in this field army hospital that had

40:52.762 --> 40:58.048
been wounded more than four hours. I mean, someone 
with their legs blown off, still bleeding from it.

41:01.713 --> 41:06.099
On the end cot in that tent was a Viet Cong who'd been 
wounded. So the Americans brought him in to try to

41:06.139 --> 41:09.623
patch him up. He had one arm blown off and both his 
legs blown off at the knees and all these other

41:10.143 --> 41:18.835
marks of, I guess he stepped in a mine or something. 
But here he is in an American hospital, set up in

41:19.857 --> 41:25.384
that cot and spit at Westmoreland. Now, that's 
either a very crazy person or a very dedicated,

41:27.427 --> 41:31.593
faithful servant. And my guess is it's the latter.

41:37.922 --> 41:38.022
Yeah. Yeah. That's the mentality our troops are 
fighting. Our troops are out there saying, why am I

41:41.800 --> 41:43.742
here? I'll be home soon. I'll be here for a year. I 
hope I don't die today. Or I hope when I climb, I hope

41:46.445 --> 41:49.348
that snake doesn't bite me. They're in an 
environment that's completely alien to them, in a

41:49.809 --> 41:52.552
jungle. And these people, life doesn't mean that 
much to them. It's whatever's inside them that

42:00.420 --> 42:02.402
makes them tick. And I don't know what that is. But 
they're very dedicated, and they're very

42:05.085 --> 42:07.588
difficult, and they're very tough.

42:11.078 --> 42:12.184
Thanks. You're welcome. How many people are you 
interviewing?
