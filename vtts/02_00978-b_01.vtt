00:02.697 --> 00:13.228
Okay, now if I'm you, give us your opinion of the 
protest movement, the people involved with them,

00:02.697 --> 00:13.228
and any legacies that may have resulted from these 
movements and these people. All right. Several

00:17.913 --> 00:23.599
changes were brought about as a result of the 
protests. Changes in housing, changes in

00:24.520 --> 00:30.426
university regulations. I cannot detail any of 
those from memory, but there's more openness in

00:30.743 --> 00:56.240
admissions for all students and efforts to 
attract

00:30.743 --> 00:56.240
minority students. The university, from where 
I've observed it, They've spent time and money and

01:01.405 --> 01:18.286
effort to try to get a better mix in the enrollment, 
and of course then they've struggled with the

01:01.405 --> 01:18.286
problem of enrollment keeping on climbing. It was 
24,564

01:19.067 --> 01:30.501
when I went there, and it's now more than 50,000 
students. they would like to get them down below

01:30.903 --> 01:38.790
that, but

01:30.903 --> 01:38.790
they can't do it. The president making a speech at 
the retired faculty staff meeting a few years ago

01:38.830 --> 02:00.370
in which I was in attendance said that the regents 
are wanting to limit enrollment, they're wanting

01:38.830 --> 02:00.370
to lower the enrollment, but the very people that 
that furnish the support for the university are

02:01.092 --> 02:11.006
people that want their kids and their friends' 
kids to keep getting into the university. So it's a

02:11.106 --> 02:15.733
sort of a vicious circle or cycle. They have to 
fight on the basis of that. But thinking about the

02:21.100 --> 02:29.412
climate, the educational climate, the racial 
climate, The economic climate that existed in 64

02:30.083 --> 02:49.466
and on into the 70s and a little bit into the 80s, I 
guess, it was just right and right for protests for

02:30.083 --> 02:49.466
change, for a call for change. And I think that some 
of the things that the, and I'll use the word,

02:50.547 --> 02:59.398
dissident students, some of the students that 
were unhappy with the military

02:59.783 --> 03:14.121
and governmental and collegiate

02:59.783 --> 03:14.121
complex. There were some things that needed to be 
looked at the total picture and make some changes.

03:22.391 --> 03:29.740
And I think that the university wouldn't have made 
some of the changes to it if there hadn't a catalyst

03:30.040 --> 03:38.989
that pushing and that the students hadn't gained 
enough ground for their voices to be heard. And

03:40.030 --> 03:57.347
student government at the university has always 
been a pretty activist group, but it never was as

03:40.030 --> 03:57.347
active as during the years that that the SDS had a 
good bit to say.

04:11.032 --> 04:26.372
I would have to leave it to the chroniclers of the 
period writing for the university, and Dr.

04:11.032 --> 04:26.372
Margaret Berry is the person that's done more in 
writing and preserving the history of the

04:27.010 --> 04:46.608
University of Texas, and she would be a fine person 
for you to contact and ask for any comments she may

04:27.010 --> 04:46.608
have or information she may have that would help to 
strengthen this. But I think that it would be

04:47.509 --> 04:55.836
ludicrous to say that the movement wasn't 
positive. It had some negative elements involved

04:59.341 --> 05:09.832
in it, but it was for some good causes and changed 
the need to be made. And of course, in an

05:09.952 --> 05:24.608
organization the size of the university, it takes 
a pretty active, noisy minority to get things

05:09.952 --> 05:24.608
done. And this was the catalyst and the nucleus 
around which a lot of students and I have been asked

05:25.432 --> 05:40.713
about the percentage, and I don't know. I have to 
say that there was not mass demonstrating on the

05:41.915 --> 05:47.062
campus. There was masses there a time or two 
demonstrating for Cambodia and for Kent State,

05:55.773 --> 06:08.566
but the others were just chipping away and getting 
the attention of the university administration.

06:10.488 --> 06:22.740
I think when the period is written up and 
remembered by the historians, it won't be a dark

06:10.488 --> 06:22.740
period on the campus of the university. It will be a 
light period. where some changes were made that

06:25.135 --> 06:35.029
ought to be made for an enlightened community such 
as UT. So from my perspective and point of view and

06:35.130 --> 06:48.409
position as a staff member there, I think the 
protest was a necessary thing.
