00:01.921 --> 00:10.950
This is an interview with Pete Hamer by Kathy Hamer 
on Saturday, December 3, 1988 at his home in

00:01.921 --> 00:10.950
Temple, Texas concerning the Vietnam War. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge about the

00:11.551 --> 00:19.619
war, I'm going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M 
Oral History Collection in the University

00:11.551 --> 00:19.619
Archives. Is that alright with you? Yes.

00:25.606 --> 00:27.207
Okay, could you please give me your full name? 
Peter Thomas Hamer. Okay, and when and where were

00:30.150 --> 00:31.692
you born? I was born in New York City in 1940, May 
1940. Okay, and what kind of family life did you

00:36.283 --> 00:40.188
have? What kind of childhood? Well... Typical? 
Well, I don't think so. Typical to what? Mommy and

00:49.722 --> 00:51.504
Daddy. Daddy went to work and my mother stayed home 
and took care of me and my brother. We lived mostly

00:57.232 --> 00:59.856
in apartments until I was about 15 or so, and then we 
bought a cheap house in a poor neighborhood, but we

01:01.658 --> 01:06.343
had a house. And,

01:07.644 --> 01:17.074
like, you know, that's how typically, I guess it's 
typical. What type of education did you have? I

01:19.897 --> 01:20.297
still have it. Okay. Okay. Yeah, well, elementary 
school, high school. I went to junior college in

01:29.127 --> 01:31.429
Staten Island. for two years. Was your father or 
grandfathers in any of the wars? No, no. Nobody in

01:40.140 --> 01:47.289
my family was ever in the war except a 
great-grandfather who was in the Union Navy

01:40.140 --> 01:47.289
during the Civil War. He was an Irish immigrant. I 
saw a picture of him once. But no, nobody else in

01:52.976 --> 01:55.779
the... I had an uncle who was in the World War II, but 
he was married my mother's sister and he was a

02:01.345 --> 02:09.334
sergeant in the army and then became a warrant 
officer. Um, how and why and when did you join the

02:09.354 --> 02:15.542
military?

02:15.562 --> 02:17.264
Well, I, how? I went down to the recruiting office 
and signed up. There were recruiting offices all

02:22.010 --> 02:30.880
over and all

02:22.010 --> 02:30.880
you had to do was Go in there, they had nice signs 
hanging up. It looked like everybody was having

02:34.323 --> 02:36.045
such a great time. In New York, there were 
recruiting officers all over the place. And how

02:42.812 --> 02:46.536
did I join up? I went down and joined up. I was a 
volunteer back when most people were draftees in

02:49.880 --> 02:54.545
the Army. You have to understand, back in the late 
50s and early 60s, the draft was still in effect.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.275
All young men were subject to the draft. In fact, 
that was a rite of passage. When you were 18, you

03:05.677 --> 03:07.780
went down and got your draft card. That was kind of 
like an ID card. You could buy booze and drink beer

03:09.122 --> 03:14.729
in the clubs and bars and stuff like that. So that 
was like a coming of age. Here in Texas, it's

03:16.471 --> 03:19.435
getting your driver's license at age 16. In New 
York, it was getting your draft card when you were

03:19.655 --> 03:23.260
18. That meant you could drink legally. But the 
draft was still in place. In fact, when I got into

03:28.446 --> 03:29.908
the Army, Oh, 80, 85%, 90% of the guys that I was in 
the Army were draftees, guys that had, who had been

03:30.715 --> 03:38.106
drafted. No, I was a, what do you call it, regular 
Army. I didn't, I had joined up. I wasn't drafted at

03:43.354 --> 03:45.197
all. Why, why did you leave? Well, you have to 
understand how it is to be in the, in the lower

03:56.028 --> 03:58.591
classes in New York. You don't have a lot of 
options. You think of a, you know, in New York

04:00.173 --> 04:04.379
everything is just great. That's the big apple of 
the world to us, but it isn't true. There's a lot of

04:06.922 --> 04:14.792
barriers that exist if you don't have the dough or 
if you don't have the background to, to draw upon.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.115
Nobody in my family had ever been to college. All I 
ever heard from my folks was how broke they were all

04:19.559 --> 04:22.803
the time. It was, It wasn't hand to mouth and my 
father always worked, but there was almost an

04:26.521 --> 04:36.952
attitude that this noble poverty is great for you. 
Buy the cheapest and make it last the longest.

04:42.518 --> 04:53.170
I had to get out of that and I couldn't figure any 
other way to do it other than by joining the

04:42.518 --> 04:53.170
military and get out of New York and seeing some of 
the world and maybe opening some doors.

04:56.407 --> 05:08.102
Navy, the Air Force, or Marines, whatever it was, 
because the Army had some really good

04:56.407 --> 05:08.102
opportunities for getting a commission, 
becoming a commissioned officer, and I saw that as

04:56.407 --> 05:08.102
a ticket. So, yeah, how did I join the Recruit 
North? Why did I join? I wanted to increase the

05:11.847 --> 05:13.589
scope of my life. It sounds corny, but it's true. 
And when did I join? I joined right after I

05:17.874 --> 05:23.021
graduated from junior college. I'd been married 
about a year and a half.

05:30.072 --> 05:37.280
February 2nd, 1962, I enlisted specifically for 
the infantry. Now, that's another story. I'd

05:39.283 --> 05:47.372
taken two years at Union College in mechanical 
technology, which is like the first two years of

05:39.283 --> 05:47.372
mechanical engineering. And when I went down to 
the recruiting office, they had a bunch of little

05:47.392 --> 05:56.402
tests that they gave me, and I scored very high on 
mechanical aptitude. Of course, I would have

05:56.422 --> 05:58.965
because of the training I just had received.

06:03.974 --> 06:15.029
to work on the Army's research and development 
facility in New Mexico, White Sands, New Mexico,

06:03.974 --> 06:15.029
testing all these big missiles out. And I was all 
set for that, and I thought about it. I said, being

06:19.956 --> 06:23.341
in the Army means being a soldier, not a grease 
monkey. So I went back to that same recruiting

06:24.282 --> 06:26.905
sergeant, and I said, look, change it. Sign me up 
for the infantry. So I joined the infantry. I went

06:29.990 --> 06:33.154
on active duty, and I... My first few years in the 
Army spent as an infantryman. Did you ever expect

06:39.254 --> 06:40.956
that you'd be going to war? Yeah. Didn't know where 
or when or how. We thought it would be in Europe. The

06:46.184 --> 06:49.389
focus then, remember the war in Berlin in 1961? 
August of 1961, the Russians put a wall up around

06:50.170 --> 06:54.176
Berlin, West Berlin. And everybody in the world 
thought we were going to go to war. and it was the

07:01.771 --> 07:04.395
Cuban Missile Crisis, remember that? Yeah, that 
was in October of 62, I believe. At that time,

07:08.562 --> 07:11.867
nobody knew where Vietnam was. I mean, it was just, 
so what?

07:17.697 --> 07:28.234
When I was in basic training, my drill instructor 
was Sergeant Jose Tamayo, and Sergeant Tamayo

07:17.697 --> 07:28.234
said, I can't wait till we, get this class over, I'm 
going to volunteer to go to South Vietnam, he

07:28.653 --> 07:34.198
called it. Because he knew there was something 
going on there, but he didn't know exactly what the

07:34.218 --> 07:40.604
name of it was. He knew it was over in the Pacific 
somewhere, but he thought it would be a good career

07:40.624 --> 07:46.850
move for him to become an advisor in South Vietnam. 
But now everybody's thinking Europe. Nobody

07:49.933 --> 07:54.197
thought about Vietnam in 1961, 62. Nobody knew 
where the hell it was.

08:00.226 --> 08:02.368
There was nothing on the media about it. It was 
really, you know, pop media. Maybe in some

08:05.391 --> 08:13.280
esoteric academic journal somewhere, some Ph.D. 
candidate was writing an article about a marriage

08:05.391 --> 08:13.280
that was involved in Southeast Asia. The other 
thing was somebody did a story about a Dr. Tom

08:13.300 --> 08:24.432
Dooley in Laos who was, apparently was killed by 
the communists there. He became a martyr by the

08:24.852 --> 08:27.735
John Birch Society back then. But no, I was 
thinking Europe. Most of what focused was Europe.

08:35.722 --> 08:39.826
How long were you in the Army before you went to 
Vietnam? Okay, I joined in 62, in February 62. I

08:43.290 --> 08:48.275
went to Vietnam in January 1968. Early January, 
January 7th. That date should be significant to

08:53.500 --> 08:55.782
you because A couple of weeks after I got to Vietnam 
is when they had that Tet Offensive. So you were

09:02.393 --> 09:05.157
there for the Tet Offensive? Oh, yeah. I was there 
for the Tet Offensive. I was there for 11 months.

09:11.465 --> 09:19.415
And every time we participated in the campaign, 
you'd get a little bronze star to put on your

09:11.465 --> 09:19.415
Vietnam service ribbon. After 11 months, I had 
five of those little bronze stars. Five major

09:22.860 --> 09:24.402
campaigns in 11 months. And that's kind of like the 
invasion of Normandy every couple of months.

09:29.510 --> 09:33.016
That's what took the campaign to where 
everybody's kicking up. Now that's had a fence up.

09:33.898 --> 09:37.605
When I got to Vietnam, everybody thought the war 
was over. Yeah. Had the bad guys on the run. That's

09:40.150 --> 09:41.092
the basic case. Your expectations when you got 
there, did you think you were not going to be there

09:41.553 --> 09:46.542
very long? Well, I know I was going to be there for 
the full year. As soon as you got off the plane, you

09:49.190 --> 09:52.453
could see that was the 51st state. That was part of 
the United States with a half a million troops

09:52.513 --> 09:56.137
there. We had to run out of the country. We could do 
anything we wanted there except at night. We got a

10:02.643 --> 10:04.245
little lonely out there in the jungle. During the 
daytime, we knew we were out of the country. Of

10:07.548 --> 10:11.772
course, we couldn't see through the dirt, and 
that's where all the bad guys were, was hiding

10:07.548 --> 10:11.772
underground in their tunnels and stuff. We didn't 
know that. Did you think you could win when you got

10:14.034 --> 10:15.956
there? You thought it was going to? be a victory for 
the United States? Sure. No doubt about it. And it

10:23.086 --> 10:24.507
was a victory for the United States. You think the 
entire war was a victory for the United States?

10:28.971 --> 10:29.372
Sure. Militarily. As long as the American 
soldiers were there on the ground, the military of

10:31.934 --> 10:37.700
the Vietnamese could never have taken that 
country over.

10:40.843 --> 10:47.089
The kids from the farms and ranches and the 
factories and the streets of the cities, went over

10:48.217 --> 10:52.681
there and did a super job. Man, they went 10,000 
miles from home against

10:52.701 --> 11:05.194
popular opinion, doing their duty like John F. 
Kennedy said, ask not what your country can do for

10:52.701 --> 11:05.194
you, but what you can do for your country. Full of 
those ideals, they went over there. The martyred

11:08.136 --> 11:12.401
president's famous words to the young 
generation. They went over there. They

11:14.923 --> 11:17.886
shouldered that burden that the government 
placed upon them. And they did a damn good job. They

11:21.664 --> 11:24.287
kicked Charlie's ass up and down that country. 
Every time that we had a contact with the North

11:24.327 --> 11:29.212
Vietnamese or the Viet Cong, we kicked their ass. 
Every time.

11:34.678 --> 11:41.065
Alright, and this one, and that country didn't 
fall to the North Vietnamese until every soldier

11:34.678 --> 11:41.065
from the United States went back home. Look that up 
in your history book. And that's what really

11:45.355 --> 11:46.737
stokes me. People say we lost the war in Vietnam. We 
didn't lose a damn thing in Vietnam. We didn't lose

11:51.664 --> 11:53.026
that war at all. What happened is the people at home 
lost the will to propagate the war. So you think it

11:59.415 --> 12:01.978
could have been won if it weren't? Oh, sure. How 
many years and how much money? No, no, no. See, the

12:06.104 --> 12:13.354
American people don't realize what a wonderful 
military establishment they had. They have

12:14.397 --> 12:19.203
officers and enlisted men who are superbly 
trained. You have no idea. In my almost 12 years of

12:21.786 --> 12:28.835
being in the Army, almost a third of that time was 
spent in one school or another.

12:31.918 --> 12:43.813
So we knew how to win that war if the American 
people, through their government,

12:31.918 --> 12:43.813
wanted to win it. See, that's the thing about a war.

12:50.257 --> 12:57.869
In Vietnam, the objective, the political 
objective of the war was not to defeat the enemy,

12:50.257 --> 12:57.869
but to get the enemy to the negotiating table. That 
was the objective of the Vietnam War. You've been

13:02.116 --> 13:03.398
studying that. Do you think we could have won World 
War II if our objective was to get Hitler to the

13:04.860 --> 13:11.490
negotiating table? No. to get Jorahito or Tojo to 
the negotiating table? No. The objective in those

13:17.875 --> 13:23.804
wars was the total and unconditional defeat of the 
enemy. Now, could the American military

13:25.807 --> 13:29.071
accomplish that in Vietnam? Yeah, we estimated we 
could do that in two weeks. He could win the war in

13:33.979 --> 13:35.160
two weeks? Two weeks, maximum. How's that? By 
approaching that conflict, that war, as a total

13:38.665 --> 13:42.471
war,

13:48.627 --> 13:54.256
maneuver to get the North Vietnamese to agree to 
some political solution in the South. What would

13:54.276 --> 13:56.259
be involved in a total war? Just like, do you 
remember bombing Japan with nuclear weapons? Or

14:02.549 --> 14:05.353
saturation bombing of the cities in Germany? 
Total war means all of the resources of one nation

14:07.496 --> 14:13.967
are focused to commit war on another nation. So you 
think we should have used nuclear weapons? We

14:16.808 --> 14:22.797
didn't need to use nuclear weapons in North 
Vietnam because it's a third world country and

14:16.808 --> 14:22.797
very small. Conventional munitions would have 
worked very nicely. Didn't we use more bombs in

14:25.561 --> 14:30.589
Vietnam, though, than they did in World War II? I 
want to know about that, but most of those bombs

14:31.450 --> 14:34.395
fell out where nobody lived. So you think if we 
would have bombed the population? Sure, just like

14:39.242 --> 14:42.968
we did in World War II, in Japan, and in Germany. 
Unfortunately, we might have blown up Jane Fonda

14:44.888 --> 14:56.383
if we did, and we wouldn't have had the benefit of 
all her marvelous artistic and exercise

14:44.888 --> 14:56.383
endeavors to draw upon for this generation.

14:59.827 --> 15:02.631
Did you do just a slight note of sarcasm? Just a 
touch. What did you think, then, of the Vietnamese

15:06.015 --> 15:07.858
people? Well, let's go back a little further. 
Okay. You talked about when did I join the army and

15:12.597 --> 15:15.220
why and all that kind of stuff. Now, all of a sudden, 
we left out six years of my life. Your training,

15:21.086 --> 15:25.571
your military career before Vietnam. Sure, you 
want to hear that? That's very interesting. Okay.

15:28.634 --> 15:28.734
Sure. See, I was a gung-ho son of a bitch, and that's 
the truth. I enlisted infantry. When I got into

15:36.202 --> 15:41.187
basic training, after getting issued my uniform 
and a short haircut, they made me an acting

15:42.483 --> 15:46.126
sergeant. Mainly because I was bigger than 
everybody else. I was six feet tall and weighed

15:48.528 --> 15:50.871
about 195 pounds. So I was a squad leader in basic 
training. And then after basic training, before I

15:54.954 --> 16:09.527
went to what they call advanced individual 
training, in my case it would have been special

15:54.954 --> 16:09.527
infantry school, they sent me to a two-week 
leadership school for guys who had shown some

15:54.954 --> 16:09.527
leadership potential. See, the Army was testing 
you and cultivating you all the way I went to this

16:13.533 --> 16:17.518
leadership school, and I graduated second in my 
class out of about 60 guys. And I went to my infantry

16:19.541 --> 16:30.035
school company, and I was made a platoon leader, 
platoon sergeant, acting platoon sergeant. I've

16:30.055 --> 16:37.605
been in the Army about 14, 15

16:30.055 --> 16:37.605
weeks now, 18, 20 weeks, and I'm an acting sergeant 
again. There's times that having 20 guys I'm in

16:38.125 --> 16:41.650
charge of, I've got about 60. And I was getting 
pretty good at leading men. I went over to graduate

16:49.089 --> 16:56.679
from what we called 11-11-1-1-1. That's basic 
infantryman with a gun school. And, oh, you have no

17:00.604 --> 17:04.950
idea what they trained you to do. You think, oh, 
just stick them with a knife and shoot a gun off. No.

17:08.434 --> 17:11.518
We got to be able to shoot an M1 rifle, a World War II 
rifle. an M1 rifle at 500 yards so that I could hit a

17:11.819 --> 17:21.114
man-sized target consistently at 500 yards. 
That's not with a telescope on the rifle or

17:21.254 --> 17:24.699
anything, that's just with my old eyeball. And how 
to navigate across unknown terrain with nothing

17:26.021 --> 17:33.714
but a map and a compass to go for miles at night.

17:36.478 --> 17:39.042
First aid, communications, operation of various 
infantry-type vehicles, supply procedures,

17:39.747 --> 17:59.526
logistics, leadership, plus a healthy dose of 
things that may surprise a lot of people, but at

17:39.747 --> 17:59.526
least have classes in ethics for infantrymen. The 
rules of war, the Geneva Convention, the American

18:00.206 --> 18:07.493
Code of Conduct, the treatment of prisoners, what 
was expected of you if you should become a

18:00.206 --> 18:07.493
prisoner, Some people would call that nothing 
more than propaganda, but it's not. It's

18:12.176 --> 18:16.340
not. You're talking about young men who were 
taking informative years, and as part and parcel

18:16.360 --> 18:26.730
of their training were taught technical things, 
but they were also taught ethical standards. And

18:26.750 --> 18:30.234
some guys, this is the first time in their life they 
were ever taught ethics. What's the right way to

18:31.435 --> 18:34.158
treat women and children? How do you treat a 
prisoner of war? What about the duties and

18:36.076 --> 18:40.322
responsibilities you have to your comrades, to 
your buddies? Can you believe that? You find it

18:44.067 --> 18:44.909
hard to believe? It's true. Okay, so my first duty 
station of all places, since I had enlisted for the

18:47.853 --> 18:54.803
infantry in Europe, they sent me to Berlin. Now, 
this is where the world was watching. I got there in

19:00.190 --> 19:05.678
July of 1962, 11 months after the Berlin Wall was 
put up. I was assigned to eight company, 6th United

19:06.788 --> 19:12.315
States Infantry, 2nd Battle Group. The Army at 
that time had been organized in battle groups. It

19:15.659 --> 19:23.608
was five maneuver companies, A, B, C, D, and E. 
Combat Support Company, which was heavy mortars

19:15.659 --> 19:23.608
and reconnaissance. And Headquarters Company, 
which is the engineers and the medics and the clerk

19:25.430 --> 19:31.758
typists in the personnel section. Battle Group 
Maintenance and things like that. Battle Group

19:34.381 --> 19:36.103
was a huge organization. was two battle groups in 
Berlin, and one tank company and an artillery

19:37.062 --> 19:44.010
company, and we were supposed to stop the 
Russians, who had 25 divisions. We always

19:44.911 --> 19:53.080
estimated that in Berlin we'd last about 30 
seconds, but it'd be a hell of an interesting 30

19:44.911 --> 19:53.080
seconds, and in Berlin that was a spit and polish 
outfit. We had a parade every Saturday, and

19:53.100 --> 20:01.349
special ceremonies, but we trained real hard. We 
used to run night problems, and we used to have, we

20:01.389 --> 20:04.352
had a mock sitting and all we did was train combat in 
the city. And they're doing that in Fort Hood right

20:09.918 --> 20:12.421
now. They have a little city out there and they're 
trying to teach these guys that it's real

20:13.422 --> 20:17.146
difficult to fight in the city. You can't take a 
foxhole and go up a street. You have to be real. So

20:22.032 --> 20:23.514
there was a lot of training. We were issued M14s 
when I got over there. We used to go to West Germany

20:28.299 --> 20:33.225
once a year so we could fire all our big weapons, the 
.50 calibers 7.62 machine guns, which we really

20:33.982 --> 20:43.413
didn't have a place to fire those in Berlin, fire 
the mortars and fire the artillery and

20:33.982 --> 20:43.413
participate in some other type of maneuvering. 
One of the things we used to train for in Berlin was

20:45.576 --> 20:50.462
riot control. Believe it or not, it was estimated 
that if the Russians wasn't going to take over the

20:50.482 --> 20:56.749
city, there'd be big riots in West Berlin. Believe 
it or not, there was a tremendous population, part

20:57.353 --> 21:06.582
of the population of West Berlin back in the early 
60s that were pro-communist, that were Russian

20:57.353 --> 21:06.582
sympathizers. Sounds strange, but so we felt that 
there was going to be an effort by the Russians to

21:08.725 --> 21:15.572
take over West Berlin by force. The spearhead was 
going to be these

21:15.852 --> 21:26.803
civilians who would propagate internal unrest, 
if you will. So I was in Berlin, I went all the way up

21:28.859 --> 21:31.922
to PFC when I was in Berlin. I got a little distant, 
but I could read and write fairly well, because I

21:32.423 --> 21:41.173
had two years of college, so I went special duty to 
the battle group headquarters, and I became a

21:32.423 --> 21:41.173
sports writer. I was at PFC, and I wrote little 
articles for the newspaper. I was still on the

21:44.096 --> 21:47.820
literature unit, but they wanted to put me in 
there. After about a year of that, I finally got an

21:50.303 --> 21:55.089
appointment to go to Austin Candidate School at 
Fort Benning. I had to apply for that. So I returned

21:58.154 --> 22:05.403
about a year later, I guess it was in the summer of 
1964 on a troop ship. I went over on a troop ship,

22:05.603 --> 22:20.080
came back on a troop ship and that's a whole, that's 
a whole new story I could tell you about taking a

22:05.603 --> 22:20.080
train from Bremerhaven, Germany all the way 
across East Germany and to Berlin at night and

22:05.603 --> 22:20.080
seeing the Russians as a young fella seeing us all 
for the first time. That's another story. But

22:21.702 --> 22:25.967
coming back from the United States, when I came 
back on a troop ship, the sailing on the, into New

22:27.027 --> 22:39.282
York Harbor, Army, Navy, Army carrier, sailing 
under the Verrazano Regiment, it was still under

22:27.027 --> 22:39.282
construction at that time. Most of the guys that 
were on that troop ship were being discharged from

22:40.324 --> 22:46.031
the military, from the Army, going home. Not me, I 
was just getting started. So here I was with about

22:48.314 --> 22:51.938
two years under my belt and I was looking forward to 
going to OCS. I was in infantry officer school at

22:52.559 --> 22:56.585
Fort Benning, Georgia. And that's the next stop. I 
was married at the time I joined the Army,

23:01.112 --> 23:04.817
incidentally. Your mom and I lived in Berlin in a 
bombed out building, right near the German

23:04.838 --> 23:09.825
border.

23:12.809 --> 23:16.555
We had to take baths together because that's all 
the hot water we could eat. Really? But it was nice.

23:19.279 --> 23:20.941
We had a little dog with us, kept us warm. Coldest 
winter in a hundred years. The Baltic Sea froze

23:22.143 --> 23:24.947
that year. It was like being in the North Pole. But 
that wasn't very hard for me. A lot of hardship

23:29.554 --> 23:30.977
always broke. You tend to regress those things. 
You remember the good things. And it was great.

23:46.323 --> 23:53.393
So, off I am to Fort Benning, Georgia to go to 
infantry officer school. Again, this whole focus

23:53.473 --> 24:02.046
of the American army is still on the conventional 
war in Europe, the sub-nuclear war in Europe. You

24:02.066 --> 24:02.867
believe that? This is 1963. Vietnam is nine years 
old already, because that thing started with

24:05.190 --> 24:08.695
Eisenhower in 1954. Nine years, no wait, even 
though we're Vietnam I. Now that was an eye-opener

24:13.930 --> 24:17.174
going to Fort Benning. Why? You ever hear of the 
Green Berets?

24:23.541 --> 24:23.681
Mm-hmm. In my, here I am, I got a whole year as an 
infantry private under my belt, half the time was

24:23.701 --> 24:35.715
spent either in a parade or right banging on a 
typewriter doing sports columns for the battle

24:23.701 --> 24:35.715
group newspaper. I'm still a private, PFC E3, RA 
12656209,

24:35.735 --> 24:43.684
still

24:46.398 --> 24:48.440
I want an appointment to go to OCS. And I check in. I 
see all these guys, staff sergeants, sergeant

24:52.085 --> 25:00.235
first class, buck sergeants, green berets, 
paratroopers out of the 101st or 82nd Airborne

24:52.085 --> 25:00.235
Division. Some sharp, tough guys from 10, 15 
years, some

25:01.516 --> 25:09.145
of them. Unbelievable.

25:12.690 --> 25:15.493
And we're talking about some guys who had been CIA 
type kind of like one of the guys, Herman Halteman,

25:16.942 --> 25:24.413
big guy, he was 34 years old, sergeant for his 
class, Green Beret. He got a special waiver

25:25.575 --> 25:29.340
because of his age to go to Oxford Candidate 
School. And this guy had been working for the CIA

25:30.121 --> 25:33.186
for years in Eastern Europe. He spoke German, 
Russian, Hungarian, Czechoslovakian. He had

25:39.715 --> 25:41.498
like four or five hundred

25:50.253 --> 25:50.974
Second Lieutenant. Interesting. Scary. Well, 
when you get to OCS, they take all your stripes and

25:54.877 --> 26:07.329
ribbons and everything, and everybody wears the 
same uniform, so you can't tell whether the guys,

25:54.877 --> 26:07.329
the next gentleman I got there just turned slob 
like myself. Were you pretty gun-hard? Oh, yeah.

26:09.371 --> 26:11.693
Everybody was. Now, Austin County School is six 
months long, and about half of the guys drop out.

26:16.298 --> 26:17.299
They can't take the stripes. They can't take the 
pressure. We used to call it pressure

26:24.442 --> 26:33.630
is to place you under enormous stress, because 
war, combat, is a lot of stress.

26:33.650 --> 26:36.213
Some people get stressed out if they break the 
shoelace.

26:38.815 --> 26:41.358
And those kind of guys, they couldn't hack it as an 
officer. You know, you start as second

26:41.378 --> 26:45.161
lieutenant, you're responsible for the lives of 
40 guys. As a company commander, you're

26:46.382 --> 26:49.005
responsible for about 150, 180 guys. A battalion 
commander, running from 800 to 1,000, brigade

26:53.804 --> 26:56.587
commander, maybe 5,000 guys. Division 
commander, anywhere from 12 to 24,000 guys. So,

27:01.534 --> 27:11.646
you gotta, the one thing that they emphasized at 
OCS was responsibility, responsibility,

27:01.534 --> 27:11.646
responsibility. Responsibility to the nation 
and responsibility to your men.

27:17.434 --> 27:19.356
And you can't fulfill those responsibilities if 
you Blow your gourd if you feel icebergs. You've

27:22.292 --> 27:25.915
got to be able to take a lot of heat, and that's what 
they throw at you, and that's the reason for it. And

27:27.116 --> 27:28.257
you want to talk about training. That school is six 
months long. Did you feel it prepared you well for

27:31.940 --> 27:35.003
Vietnam? Oh, yeah, sure. It prepared me well for 
the rest of my life.

27:41.689 --> 27:41.969
Sure. Did they teach you anything about guerrilla 
warfare? Sure. Sure, what do you think? And at Fort

27:48.749 --> 27:57.759
Benning,

27:48.749 --> 27:57.759
besides running, they call it the infantry 
school. What is guerrilla warfare? Nothing more

27:58.880 --> 28:03.005
than infantry tactics on a small unit level. We 
studied Chairman Mao and his principles of

28:03.025 --> 28:06.849
guerrilla warfare. You've got to know your enemy, 
right? We studied the Russian partisan actions in

28:10.794 --> 28:13.317
World War II. We studied a lot of things. We studied 
Quantrell and his Raiders in the Civil War and how

28:15.462 --> 28:21.869
they used various guerrilla tactics.

28:26.395 --> 28:36.406
We also, as

28:26.395 --> 28:36.406
students, would study other approaches to 
warfare, like warfare being an extension of

28:26.395 --> 28:36.406
political objectives.

28:38.909 --> 28:41.352
The one thing that we came to realize

28:47.626 --> 28:48.608
when it came to warfare.

28:53.155 --> 28:58.143
That would be very prophetic later on in the early 
70s.

29:00.927 --> 29:03.351
But getting back to Fort Benning was great 
training. And you graduated from there as a second

29:03.371 --> 29:11.083
lieutenant, and you felt in your mind, you knew 
that there was nothing that you could not achieve.

29:12.826 --> 29:13.988
That's not much self-confidence. We figured half 
of your peer group has dropped out because of lack

29:14.508 --> 29:19.935
of motivation or self-discipline or inability to 
cope with stress. That means those who did

29:20.555 --> 29:30.027
graduate were pretty damn tough

29:20.555 --> 29:30.027
and tell you how down-to-earth I was. I was a pretty 
good student. I graduated, I guess, in the upper

29:32.109 --> 29:40.279
third of my class and that's, that's pretty good 
academically.

29:42.571 --> 29:46.136
I excelled at some of the technical subjects, and I 
was very good at communications. I enjoyed

29:46.977 --> 29:48.399
working in communications.

29:51.282 --> 29:59.293
You give me a flashlight battery and a piece of 
wire, and I could talk to anybody, almost. And I was

29:59.313 --> 30:03.499
very, very good at map and compass work. This would 
prove to be important later on, because I

30:04.760 --> 30:09.186
transferred from the Infrared to Sigma Corps.

30:13.621 --> 30:17.225
Well, when I graduated, I was planning to go to 
airborne ranger school. And that's a paratrooper

30:19.167 --> 30:30.939
school and nine weeks ranger training in Fort 
Benning in Florida and up in the mountains of

30:19.167 --> 30:30.939
someplace out, I guess it was in Georgia.

30:30.959 --> 30:35.704
And, but instead I went to communication school. 
And that was a 10-week course in combat

30:35.724 --> 30:40.389
communication. And I went back to Europe as a 
second lieutenant. I was assigned to an infantry

30:43.237 --> 30:52.429
brigade headquarter, and I was the 
communications platoon leader as an infantry

30:43.237 --> 30:52.429
officer. I was the communications platoon and 
headquarters company of the 3rd Brigade, 8th

30:52.450 --> 30:56.495
Division. It was my job to maintain 
communications and supervise the men who

30:57.536 --> 31:07.670
actually provided the communications for the 
brigade headquarters. Big job. That's a homely

31:08.992 --> 31:09.733
story. I spent three years in that job in Germany, 
in the 8th Division. Was that in Mannheim? That's

31:18.727 --> 31:19.628
in Mannheim, Germany. Coleman Barracks in 
Sandhofen, Germany was right outside of

31:19.708 --> 31:27.675
Mannheim.

31:28.776 --> 31:36.022
While there, towards the end of that tour, I 
transferred to Signal Corps and then came back to

31:28.776 --> 31:36.022
the United States and went to the Signal Officers 
Career Course. I was a captain by now. And went to

31:38.504 --> 31:39.265
the signal officer career course at Fort 
Monmouth, and that's where your sister Jennifer

31:40.628 --> 31:46.195
was born in 1967 in August. But it's an interesting 
thing. By 1966 now, Vietnam was starting to build

31:51.202 --> 31:54.726
up. This gave me quite a buildup. And an infantry 
battalion, and I was in an infantry battalion. I

32:01.235 --> 32:04.459
was a battalion communications officer. That's 
on the operation staff. It's the staff officer's

32:08.477 --> 32:09.878
job. You know, you have a platoon of guys, but the 
platoon's hardly running.

32:16.505 --> 32:19.868
While I was there, I had put in my branch transfer 
for Signal Corps. So, if there's a pending

32:19.888 --> 32:24.112
personnel action, they can't, you're kind of 
flagged. They can't really give you another

32:24.132 --> 32:31.259
personnel action until that one is resolved. So, I 
had I wasn't thinking Vietnam, I was just thinking

32:33.430 --> 32:39.136
long-term career, because that was definitely a 
career I was in for the 20 or 30 year. The...

32:40.377 --> 32:54.671
All of a sudden, in 1966, all of our officers, even 
guys who had only been there a short period of time,

32:40.377 --> 32:54.671
were getting orders to go back to the States. The 
8th Division was being stripped of officers

32:55.732 --> 33:02.458
because they were constituting the 9th Infantry 
Division, I think it was in Fort Lewis. They were

33:06.304 --> 33:10.490
reactivating the 9th Infantry Division and they 
were going to send that whole division to Vietnam.

33:11.611 --> 33:16.177
Well, you just don't overnight get lieutenants 
and captains and majors. You've got to take the

33:16.497 --> 33:22.025
ones that are there, so you strip from the other 
units. Our battalion was stripped of officers.

33:27.131 --> 33:28.573
The battalion commander was gone. All of the staff 
officers were gone. All of the captains that were

33:33.067 --> 33:35.911
company commanders were gone. All of the 
lieutenants were gone. All of a sudden, they had

33:38.435 --> 33:42.541
like one week to pack up and go to the States. 
Because I had this branch transfer request in,

33:43.662 --> 33:46.386
they didn't call me. So all of a sudden, my branch 
transfer comes through, and here is the weirdest

33:48.229 --> 33:55.219
company in the United States Army. I'm the company 
commander. I'm a captain or a first lieutenant.

34:03.256 --> 34:13.990
company commander of headquarters and 
headquarters company

34:03.256 --> 34:13.990
of 2nd Battalion, 13th Infantry.

34:14.010 --> 34:18.616
And I'm a signal corps lieutenant, commanding an 
infantry company. That wasn't so strange. The

34:19.858 --> 34:25.185
battalion commander was a captain who was in the 
adjutant general's corps. He was a paper pusher.

34:28.589 --> 34:32.014
And I had, in my headquarters and headquarters 
company, more firepower than General George

34:32.483 --> 34:41.751
Patton had in World War II, because they had a Davy 
Crockett section that fired nuclear weapons. I

34:41.771 --> 34:52.361
had, I was a first lieutenant single corps in the 
infantry, and I, and I had nuclear weapons

34:41.771 --> 34:52.361
capability in Germany, and my boss was a captain in 
the paper person corps. Then we kind of know that

34:52.381 --> 34:58.206
something was going on, that's for sure, there's 
something going on in Vietnam. The, they stripped

34:58.226 --> 35:00.128
us clean. I transferred to a signal corps unit 
there for about six or eight months and we got my

35:02.065 --> 35:24.704
orders to... that's the thing about being in the 
signal corps, you can pick up the telephone and you

35:02.065 --> 35:24.704
can go to Washington all the time and I got the boys 
at the signal branch headquarters to assign me to

35:02.065 --> 35:24.704
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey to go to this school. By 
then I had me captain

35:31.698 --> 35:38.764
Mommy Jean was pregnant with Jennifer, and I 
didn't want to go to Vietnam while she was

35:31.698 --> 35:38.764
pregnant. I wouldn't want to have a baby while I was 
away at the war. And

35:43.068 --> 35:51.596
Monmouth was right close to where our families 
were in New York City. It's only about a 40-minute

35:51.616 --> 35:56.060
drive from New York City. So it worked out. The 
signal branch boy said, yeah, we'll send you to

35:56.680 --> 35:59.983
school, and then you'll be going to Vietnam. I 
said, great. That seemed like a normal, natural

36:01.550 --> 36:04.214
career progression. Let's take a little break 
here, okay? At Fort Monmouth, we were talking

36:07.199 --> 36:10.684
about what was going on. That was a career course 
and still the bulk of the training, of course,

36:10.704 --> 36:29.093
Sigma Corps being responsible for military 
communications was, we were trained to be

36:10.704 --> 36:29.093
managers of large communications networks and 
systems and all the technical things that

36:10.704 --> 36:29.093
involved in that.

36:29.967 --> 36:36.675
But the main thrust of all our tactical and 
strategic type training was still the European

36:29.967 --> 36:36.675
conventional warfare. Divisions moving here, 
armies moving here. And some

36:40.219 --> 36:47.288
training time was devoted towards what was going 
on in Vietnam. Surprisingly enough, as a

36:48.028 --> 36:57.800
professional officer, what was more interesting 
in 1967 in Vietnam was the Arab-Israeli Seven-Day

36:48.028 --> 36:57.800
War. You remember that, in 1967? That's where the 
Jews whooped everybody's butt in about a week.

37:07.697 --> 37:09.439
Yeah, you might have heard about that, I'm sure. We 
were more interested in that than we were in what

37:10.680 --> 37:18.367
was going on in Vietnam, because Vietnam still in 
1967 was thought to be a so what type endeavor. I

37:19.328 --> 37:26.175
mean, it was something that we knew as 
professional soldiers that if the government

37:19.328 --> 37:26.175
gave us the green light, we could wrap that up in a 
couple of weeks. So you expected to be a short

37:27.035 --> 37:29.758
victory? Yeah, if the politicians would ever get 
off their ass and let us go in there and win it.

37:36.743 --> 37:48.653
What's interesting now is we're starting to hear 
about friends, guys we've served with, getting

37:36.743 --> 37:48.653
wounded or being killed over there. Remember 1962 
is when I came in, went to OCS in 63, 64. A couple of my

37:53.398 --> 37:58.041
classmates from OCS had been killed in Vietnam by 
now. Oh, in 67? Well by this time, one guy was an

38:00.215 --> 38:04.022
advisor, he got killed. Uh, Greenlightsville had 
three daughters, three young daughters, used to

38:05.485 --> 38:10.193
go to church with them. He got killed over there 
right after I went to Europe, I heard about that.

38:15.983 --> 38:22.375
And uh, you start hearing about guys that got, like 
my company commander, a guy by the name of

38:15.983 --> 38:22.375
Richardson, in the 8th Division, in A Company. I 
was a platoon leader for him, he was a company

38:26.913 --> 38:28.995
commander. He had gone over there as a major and 
stepped on a landline and blew his leg off. He

38:38.303 --> 38:43.968
wasn't killed, but his military career was over.

38:43.988 --> 38:49.333
So you start hearing about guys now that you knew, 
well I said it was personal, it's not academic

38:43.988 --> 38:49.333
anymore. Guys that you served with, 
professionals themselves who Now the academics

38:53.455 --> 38:56.760
are over, now this is a real situation. It kind of 
makes you think now all of a sudden you could

38:57.241 --> 39:01.427
possibly be in that situation yourself. But 
Vietnam was still not the number one priority as

39:01.447 --> 39:07.536
far as the military mission was concerned. We're 
still at war in Europe. We were very concerned

39:09.339 --> 39:10.701
about that. Europe. Vietnam we knew, we knew to 
wrap that thing up in a couple of weeks. And our

39:16.770 --> 39:21.437
strategy that we had developed at the signal 
school and our strategy and tactics and peer

39:22.902 --> 39:52.032
instruction, the most viable way to bring North 
Vietnamese to their knees to win unconditional

39:22.902 --> 39:52.032
surrender, blockade their harbors,

39:22.902 --> 39:52.032
bomb saturate, bomb their cities, and then if you 
get a map of North Vietnam, you see the Red River?

39:53.513 --> 39:59.640
The Red River is protect, the land surrounding the 
Red River is the crop producing lands of North

39:53.513 --> 39:59.640
Vietnam. It's all protected by dikes. Just go in 
here and blow up the dikes. Flood them. Flood them

40:04.465 --> 40:06.728
out and all their food production would cease. 
It's very easy to close the border that they have

40:07.208 --> 40:12.414
with China because it's so small, such a small 
area. So it made a problem to do that. So we had the

40:15.117 --> 40:19.842
power to accomplish all those things. We could 
send those people back to the Stone Age in two

40:21.458 --> 40:24.862
weeks. And it was viable. It could be done. But we 
didn't have the political green light.

40:34.213 --> 40:37.297
But yeah, that strategy could have been attained, 
no problem. We never did that. Do you think it

40:38.358 --> 40:39.639
should have been done? Yeah, sure. You should 
never commit your soldiers to fight in a war where

40:41.001 --> 40:47.989
the objective of that war is to win.

40:52.323 --> 40:57.789
You should never commit your troops where the 
objective of the war is not clear, like in Vietnam.

40:57.829 --> 40:59.030
The objective there was not clear. The objective 
there was to somehow encourage the North

40:59.791 --> 41:08.680
Vietnamese to enter into a negotiated 
settlement. Why do you think the United States

41:08.881 --> 41:12.424
wanted to...what was the goal? What was the goal? 
Uh-huh. To protect the world from communism? No.

41:20.926 --> 41:29.096
There's a principle called precedent, which 
presidents, like courts, do the same thing. The

41:30.077 --> 41:31.899
Monroe Doctrine is a classic example. President 
Monroe has been dead many, many years now, but yet

41:31.939 --> 41:36.484
his doctrine is still, quote, alive. End quote. 
It's ailing, but it's still alive. American

41:44.493 --> 41:50.140
policy had really not changed since President 
Eisenhower. President Kennedy, President

41:50.693 --> 41:53.335
Johnson. It was still a policy to somehow prevent 
further extensions of communist governments

41:54.697 --> 42:03.925
throughout the world. Kind of build fences so they 
said, okay, what you've got, you've got, you can't

42:03.946 --> 42:08.650
get any more. And the domino theory and if we didn't 
win in Vietnam, it'd be a bloodbath. Well, that was

42:14.455 --> 42:15.456
true. Look what happened in Cambodia. But There 
was no stated desire to achieve a military victory

42:20.798 --> 42:26.103
there. If the President of the United States had 
called up the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

42:28.065 --> 42:36.954
and said, look, I'm going to take two weeks off at 
Camp David. When I come back, I want that thing to be

42:36.974 --> 42:39.396
over. Do what you think is necessary, short a 
nuclear war, but have this thing wound up in two

42:41.058 --> 42:45.863
weeks. We had the resources and the military 
combat power to do that. We could have wound that

42:52.051 --> 42:53.292
thing up in two weeks.

42:57.978 --> 42:58.278
Sure. And we wouldn't even have to fly one 
airplane. Send a battleship to New Jersey over

43:00.421 --> 43:02.843
there. And a couple of salvos would have taken out 
Hanoi. They would have taken out Haiphong.

43:15.338 --> 43:20.083
Any ship coming or going out of their ports, blown 
out of the water, and all of a sudden, they're going

43:20.637 --> 43:22.459
to start losing interest in that war. There's an 
old joke that says, we could win the war, but there

43:24.442 --> 43:32.993
wouldn't be anybody on the enemy's side to come to 
the surrender talk. Because those people were

43:33.013 --> 43:33.955
real tough. They didn't believe in surrendering. 
We just had to kill them all. But we could have done

43:35.697 --> 43:36.899
it. It would have been easy. You would think that 
would be fine? Sure. Uh-huh. If that's what the

43:44.949 --> 43:49.395
government wanted to do, and if that was a stated 
objective, you betcha. See, the guys in the Army

43:50.303 --> 44:00.036
are early on taught that they are subordinate to 
civilian authority. That's always been the case

44:00.717 --> 44:02.459
in America. We are subordinate to civilian 
authority. So it's not the soldiers who wage the

44:07.366 --> 44:12.092
wars, it's the civilians. It's the professional 
soldier who goes out and does the dirty work.

44:17.680 --> 44:18.181
Are you with me? You follow what I'm saying? If the 
civilian authority's stated objectives are

44:21.083 --> 44:32.657
unclear,

44:21.083 --> 44:32.657
well, the soldier still has to go out and do what he 
can under the orders he's given. So they are...

44:35.160 --> 44:44.691
What good is winning the country free from 
communism, though, if there's no one left to live

44:35.160 --> 44:44.691
there? Oh, well... Are you trying to protect the 
people or the land area? We're not trying to

44:47.775 --> 44:48.896
protect anybody. We're trying to kill them all. up 
north, that was the enemy. But it was, it was

44:53.567 --> 44:55.069
ridiculous. You're chasing some bad guys in the 
jungle and all of a sudden it comes in a race that

44:55.089 --> 45:01.357
says, stop, you can't go into Cambodia to pursue 
them. That's ridiculous. It's like the old days of

45:03.299 --> 45:06.303
Bonnie and Clyde where the police couldn't cross 
state lines. So, you know, it was a strange

45:08.186 --> 45:19.120
situation and from the military standpoint, from 
a purely military standpoint, that war could have

45:08.186 --> 45:19.120
been won as a conventional war. That is, total 
destruction of the enemy's ability to wage war. We

45:23.042 --> 45:25.806
could have done that. We had the power to do it. But 
the civilian authorities didn't state that as an

45:27.829 --> 45:31.314
objective. To this day, I'm not entirely sure what 
they had in mind when they committed all the

45:32.595 --> 45:36.821
soldiers there. I'm pretty sure what it was that 
they wanted to show so much power, so much

45:37.462 --> 45:48.837
determination, North Vietnamese would cave in 
and say, okay, we'll negotiate. Of

45:50.977 --> 45:55.943
course, we didn't understand their 
determination. Do you think it would have helped

45:57.485 --> 46:00.529
to know their culture and their people better? 
Yeah. Did you know anything about them? Well, no.

46:05.195 --> 46:07.858
We didn't know that much about the North 
Vietnamese. I mean, who did? I mean, the French had

46:08.459 --> 46:11.743
been living there. There had been a French colony 
since who knows?

46:21.554 --> 46:26.401
The French didn't understand that those people 
had a very strong sense of national identity. They

46:26.421 --> 46:27.743
didn't know that. They thought they were just 
happy to be French members of a French colony. They

46:32.730 --> 46:37.717
didn't realize that those people have been 
fighting over that part of the world for 4,000

46:32.730 --> 46:37.717
years. Everybody wants Vietnam. You know why 
everybody wants Vietnam? Rice. Oh, do you think?

46:45.068 --> 46:45.409
Sure. So do you think... Especially South 
Vietnam. It's the rice bowl of the whole Asia. They

46:49.835 --> 46:51.257
export rice like crazy. And especially since in 
the 1950s, we introduced all those high yield

46:52.857 --> 47:00.674
rices, you know, that trouble of triple the 
acreage, the production for acreage. It's really

47:00.694 --> 47:01.496
fascinating. But you get into just a little bit of 
Vietnam history, and that country...
