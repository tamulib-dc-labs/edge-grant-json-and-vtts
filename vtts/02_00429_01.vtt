WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:02.583
On both sides? OK. All right. Here we go. This is an 
interview with Thomas Beltran by Diana Elizondo

00:08.552 --> 00:20.749
on November the 12th, 1989, at his home in 4603 
Windlock in San Antonio, Texas, about Vietnam. In

00:20.769 --> 00:28.701
the interest of accumulating knowledge, I'm 
asking you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas

00:20.769 --> 00:28.701
A&M Oral History Collection in the University 
Archives. Is that all right with you? Yes. Right.

00:34.455 --> 00:40.062
To begin with, can you just tell me about your 
background, like when you were born, where did you

00:34.455 --> 00:40.062
grow up? I was born in 1946, and I grew up on the east 
side of San Antonio. Okay, and how was that like?

00:51.177 --> 00:52.719
Tell me about your family. Mainly I was raised by my 
grandparents because my parents were divorced

00:52.979 --> 01:00.889
when I was about six years old. And... My 
grandfather was mainly my role model.

01:13.052 --> 01:14.954
How about your schooling? What did you think about 
school? I liked school, and I wanted to go to

01:18.379 --> 01:23.887
college and all that stuff. But my mother being a 
single parent, and I had an adopted brother, and

01:23.907 --> 01:34.281
she had to provide for both of us. So I didn't want to 
be a burden on her anymore than necessary. So after

01:40.184 --> 01:50.198
high school, I started working in a wood shop, 
carpentry work. When was this, what year? In 1965.

01:54.163 --> 01:58.429
And Vietnam had just started.

02:00.704 --> 02:06.271
I did want to work longer, but then I got my draft 
notice that I was going to be drafted into the Army.

02:08.234 --> 02:16.204
So I didn't want to go into the Army because all my 
grandfather and my uncles and my father had been in

02:08.234 --> 02:16.204
the Army. And if I was going to go overseas and 
fight, I wanted to be under the best conditions in

02:17.746 --> 02:28.399
my favor, so I decided to join the Marine Corps. So 
you mean like if you were with the Marines, what,

02:29.155 --> 02:33.281
that you'd be better protected or learn things 
better? Yeah, I felt I'd have more confidence and

02:33.341 --> 02:42.094
better training in the Marines. What scared you 
about the Army? I mean, what did it seem? To me, the

02:46.541 --> 02:50.446
Army kind of lacked a certain discipline.

02:53.311 --> 02:57.677
They didn't have what I would call a real... strict 
discipline or coerciveness, working together

02:58.636 --> 03:04.642
kind of thing. And you found that in the Marines? 
Yes. How did you first hear about the Marines and

03:08.446 --> 03:12.289
get that impression from them? Well, I used to, 
when I was a kid I used to read a lot of war comics and

03:12.309 --> 03:19.577
stuff like that. And that's where I got most of it 
from, comic books. Okay, so when did you first hear

03:24.682 --> 03:27.124
about Vietnam? Right after Kennedy was 
assassinated, and it was still kind of in the

03:29.180 --> 03:50.088
background, but Kennedy kept trying to get across 
to us that we had to stop communism as far away from

03:29.180 --> 03:50.088
our shores as possible. And that's why he was 
sending, at first they started sending advisors

03:51.069 --> 03:57.297
to Vietnam.

03:58.677 --> 04:00.119
That's when I first heard about it. Did you ever, 
when you were working, did you ever really want to

04:00.859 --> 04:05.445
go over and fight? I mean, did you think, hey, I'd 
like to do that, or? Well, it was like a fascination

04:09.689 --> 04:28.110
at first, you know, because my, like I said, my 
grandfather, he was in World War I, and then my

04:09.689 --> 04:28.110
uncles were in World War II, and then my younger 
relatives were in Korea. So I figured it was

04:28.951 --> 04:32.695
Vietnam was my turn. Okay.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.701
And at this time when you were called, were you 
married yet? Or how were you living? Were you still

04:41.042 --> 04:43.044
living with your mom then? Well, I was living with 
my mother when I got my draft notice. And

04:48.690 --> 04:55.296
I went ahead and joined the Marines and went to boot 
camp. And then when I was home on my 30 days leave, I

04:56.187 --> 04:59.770
got married. OK. And why did you get married? Well, 
I just needed something to come home to. And I was

05:08.759 --> 05:12.342
really in love with your aunt. How did she feel 
about when she found out that you were drafted?

05:19.349 --> 05:21.491
Well, she didn't like it. And she was worried about 
it, but I guess It's just a part of life a man has to go

05:25.567 --> 05:31.374
through. In those days it was. And your mom, how did 
she feel about it? She was really practically

05:35.278 --> 05:39.703
hysterical, crying. She wrote to our congressman 
trying to get me out of going.

05:50.675 --> 05:52.097
She was really hysterical to me. Okay. So when were 
you actually drafted, and was it by the lottery

05:54.805 --> 06:00.114
system, or was it... No, I wasn't drafted. I went 
ahead and volunteered in the Marines. Okay. And

06:03.400 --> 06:07.106
when you did, how long would your tour of duty be? In 
Vietnam, it was 13 months. 13 months. Okay. Could

06:13.957 --> 06:18.304
you tell me about, like, your... about... your 
training, like what did they teach you in boot

06:18.588 --> 06:20.851
camp? Was there like counter-insurgency tactics 
or what did you concentrate on? Well, basically we

06:24.677 --> 06:43.104
started off with hand-to-hand combat in boot camp 
and then marksmanship, how to use, shoot real good

06:24.677 --> 06:43.104
and the basics, map reading so you know where you 
were at all the time. All the basic military

06:43.144 --> 06:46.890
skills, what you learned And then when you make it 
through boot camp, then they test you and you get

06:47.731 --> 06:56.103
your specialized training. Which is what? Your 
military occupational status. Like if you're

07:02.532 --> 07:14.009
mechanically inclined, they'll send you to 
either aviation school or armored vehicles,

07:02.532 --> 07:14.009
things mechanical. And then if you... or into 
electronics and stuff. They didn't send you

07:19.925 --> 07:23.309
either to radar or radio school or whatever. So 
what was your area of specialization? I went into

07:27.174 --> 07:31.279
armored personnel carriers because I was 
mechanically inclined. What does that mean?

07:32.841 --> 07:45.236
Well, these were amphibious vehicles that we used 
to go on river patrols and to make beach landings

07:32.841 --> 07:45.236
off ships. We would drive off a ship into the water 
and make beach landings. So you were in charge of

07:50.949 --> 07:53.372
making sure that those machines worked? Yeah. 
Okay. Does that mean that you would be engaged in

07:55.314 --> 07:59.398
combat? Do you know what I mean? Yes. When I was in 
Vietnam, we were what was called, used as a

08:01.460 --> 08:06.406
blocking force. The infantry would sweep through 
an area of the country, and we would be hidden in the

08:06.426 --> 08:16.176
jungle. And whatever enemy they pushed towards 
us, we'd be like a wall there to stop them. Okay.

08:23.228 --> 08:24.470
With our firepower. All right. And during your 
training, did you notice any difference or any,

08:26.131 --> 08:30.935
like, racism? Like, were there just white 
officers and Hispanic, you know, units? Or was it

08:35.399 --> 08:39.283
integration of troops, you know, blacks and 
whites and everybody all together? And how did you

08:39.403 --> 08:41.565
feel about your officers? Yeah, well, when I was in 
boot camp, we had black and white. drill

08:47.003 --> 09:03.885
instructors and some Hispanics, quite a few 
Filipinos and other nationalities that would do

08:47.003 --> 09:03.885
their five years military service to get 
citizenship in the United States. What did you

09:04.225 --> 09:05.627
think of your officers? I thought they were a real 
good class of officers.

09:14.864 --> 09:18.148
They were more, a little bit more human than I 
thought, you know. They were more sensitive than I

09:18.588 --> 09:20.851
had expected. I mean, like in what sense? Well, 
they, they felt for their, their troops a little

09:23.775 --> 09:34.968
more than, than I had expected. I thought they'd 
just be barking orders all the time instead of

09:35.048 --> 09:42.036
trying to get to know you and, and learn about you 
and work with you in whatever situation you were

09:43.771 --> 09:48.959
in. So you felt that in your unit... Is the unit that 
you train with in boot camp the one that you go out

09:48.979 --> 09:54.788
to? No, no. After boot camp, like I said, you each go 
into whatever you're inclined, your military

09:57.472 --> 10:05.204
occupation. And then after your specialized 
school, then we went to... Jungle Warfare School

10:12.340 --> 10:15.363
to prepare for Vietnam. Where was that at? It was at 
Camp Pendleton, California. And basically what

10:20.568 --> 10:40.187
we learned is how to camouflage ourselves to blend 
in with the countryside and restrict our

10:20.568 --> 10:40.187
movements and they'd give us an objective and we'd 
go and blow it up and learn first aid and how to care

10:41.399 --> 10:49.007
for wounds in the jungle because they get infected 
right away and all that stuff. And then we were

10:49.027 --> 10:57.255
broken up in groups of, there was 300 of us that flew 
to Vietnam. But once you go from here to Okinawa,

10:58.036 --> 11:03.221
well, Wake Island was the midpoint. And then we 
landed on Okinawa. We were again split up. We

11:10.593 --> 11:17.423
turned in all our stateside gear and drew jungle 
equipment. And then we flew, like I flew from

11:18.083 --> 11:22.570
Okinawa to Chu Lai, Vietnam. That's where I 
started. It's about in the second core area.

11:30.821 --> 11:33.445
Mainly I was in the second core and the I core area. 
which is the upper northern part of Vietnam. Oh, so

11:36.368 --> 11:38.630
close to the northern border? Yeah, the last few 
months I ended up along the DMZ, the Demiller

11:38.750 --> 11:43.255
County. Oh, yeah, okay. Just a little bit about 
your training, the jungle warfare. Did the

11:48.541 --> 11:53.646
conditions there in Camp Pendleton, were they the 
same as when you were out there fighting? I mean,

11:53.746 --> 11:58.732
could you say that, that the jungle that was there 
in Vietnam was the same as California? No, no. No,

11:59.492 --> 12:00.934
California is real. Camp Elton especially is real 
rocky and hilly, but Vietnam is a dense kind of

12:01.589 --> 12:09.978
jungle. Like in July, for three miles inland, it 
was nothing but white sand and sparse growth. And

12:20.109 --> 12:30.921
when you got after the three miles in, it became the 
dense jungle covered mountains and hills.

12:31.559 --> 12:36.386
Nothing over here prepared us, really, for what we 
were going to go through. I mean, when you saw the

12:36.406 --> 12:40.853
jungle and everything, you said, like, this is not 
what we were trained for. All right. Yeah, it was

12:42.656 --> 12:45.300
kind of spooky and eerie, yeah. But, you know, when 
you're young, you feel like you can do anything, go

12:46.762 --> 12:51.829
through anything. So the looks of it didn't bother 
me. Mainly it was the heat that bothered me, the

12:56.296 --> 12:58.620
hot. Uh-huh. Because we were hot. hot and sweaty 
all the time. And everything was an effort, you

13:02.587 --> 13:05.910
know, when you're under those conditions. The 
hot, humid air was thick and musty to breathe and

13:06.370 --> 13:13.236
everything. Okay. So when did you actually, what 
date could you give me that you left camp to

13:13.837 --> 13:19.181
Vietnam? It's easier to remember because it was 
May, about May the 15th. It was several days before

13:26.308 --> 13:30.051
my 20th birthday. I was 19 years old. So that was 
what year? 19... 1965. 1965 you went? Yeah. Okay.

13:41.008 --> 13:41.289
Alright. Well, 66 actually. Yeah. May of 66. Okay, 
that's when you went. Yeah. Okay, and when you

13:47.137 --> 13:51.344
left, what did you think you were going to do in 
Vietnam? I mean, what was the mission and what was

13:51.364 --> 13:53.026
the point? Were you also advising or helping 
Arvin? No. We were already involved in the combat

13:58.145 --> 14:01.850
stage. Well, I knew our mission was mainly to keep 
the infantry supplied with whatever we could

14:02.891 --> 14:18.532
carry, because in this amphibious vehicle, we 
could carry ammunition, food, troops,

14:02.891 --> 14:18.532
everything. It was like a big cargo carrying type 
of vehicle. Okay. On the way to Vietnam, what kind

14:29.900 --> 14:35.867
of plane did you go in, and was it all the men? What 
were the men talking about? What did you all talk

14:37.188 --> 14:38.309
about? Well, there was 300 of us, and we flew over in 
a C-141. They call it the Starlifter. And there

14:47.199 --> 14:55.067
was, all the time we were making remarks about the 
plane, that it looked like, because when we landed

14:47.199 --> 14:55.067
on When we were going to take off from Edwards Air 
Force Base, it broke. One of the engines or

15:00.583 --> 15:01.865
something. So we ended up spending an additional 
two days at Edwards Air Force Base. And it was

15:07.631 --> 15:09.393
mainly an Air Force Base. And they weren't used to 
having 300 Marines running around their base. So

15:15.659 --> 15:19.924
we got a lot of comments from the the dependents 
there that didn't like having 300 Marines running

15:21.068 --> 15:26.576
all over, running wild on their base. And so when it 
finally did take off, we were all kind of worried,

15:27.937 --> 15:44.139
because usually you are way up in the air and you can 
see nothing but the Pacific Ocean down below, and

15:27.937 --> 15:44.139
it's something like a 10 to 12 hour flight from 
Edwards to Wake Island. And so one of the guys says,

15:45.441 --> 15:48.966
how does it feel being in 30,000 nuts and bolts 
flying in close formation. There was a good sense

15:54.100 --> 16:00.227
of humor and camaraderie on the airplane all the 
time. Did anybody ever express fear, like, oh, I'm

16:00.848 --> 16:08.617
afraid of this, or, you know, if something 
happens, but don't, you know. No, a lot of us, you

16:08.637 --> 16:11.781
know, Being in the Marines, you learn your 
discipline. You keep your fears hidden to

16:14.527 --> 16:16.609
yourself. You don't show it or make it known.

16:26.258 --> 16:32.725
So once you got to Vietnam, your commanding 
officers, did you think that they were competent?

16:32.745 --> 16:34.366
I mean, at the beginning, did you think they were? 
Were you confident with them? Yes. There was a

16:40.617 --> 16:43.500
captain in charge of our company. I thought he was 
real competent. And there was this one weird staff

16:46.943 --> 16:51.507
sergeant, he was a Filipino. We didn't have any 
confidence at all in him. Why? Well, he kind of

16:57.493 --> 17:09.865
like, he was afraid to die and he slept in a box at 
night in case the enemy came and overran us. They

17:10.418 --> 17:16.205
wouldn't find him and kill him, so he'd hide 
himself in a box and sleep in a box at night. Like a

17:16.385 --> 17:18.147
cardboard box or something? Well, it was a wooden 
box. So you're talking about the Filipino officer

17:20.891 --> 17:23.033
now? Well, he was a staff sergeant, and he was only 
there for about three more months, and I guess he

17:23.654 --> 17:32.545
was... He realized he was getting real close to 
coming home, and he didn't want anything to happen

17:33.149 --> 17:37.655
to him. So where would he put this cardboard? Was it 
a cardboard box he would sleep in? No, it was like a

17:41.781 --> 17:46.869
wooden oblong crate, like a shipping crate. Yeah. 
And he kept it in a tent, because we all lived in

17:48.171 --> 17:53.238
tents in those days. But he really didn't sleep in 
that crate. Was he abused by the other officers and

17:58.327 --> 18:01.572
by maybe even you all? I don't know, because he was 
more like a supply

18:01.672 --> 18:13.349
staff sergeant, and we would just go to him when we 
needed parts to put on our vehicles and stuff. We

18:14.230 --> 18:28.030
didn't have that much to do with him, except at 
night when we were on beach guard, sometimes he'd

18:14.230 --> 18:28.030
be the duty NCO, and he'd have to come and check us to 
see if we were awake and on duty. Did he do that well

18:28.246 --> 18:29.668
or? Yeah, yeah, he was real good at it. Okay, 
because I was going to say, if he ever gave you an

18:32.432 --> 18:38.120
order, was it like, yeah, whatever, or would you 
really listen to him? Well, I guess basically we

18:39.101 --> 18:42.746
didn't really have to listen to him. And, oh, go 
ahead. Because of the, you know, military

18:45.190 --> 18:51.098
discipline and rank and all that stuff, general 
orders. Okay, and so your head officer was who, and

18:51.685 --> 18:56.430
where, could you tell me about himself? Was he 
white or what? Well, Captain, I think his name was

18:59.033 --> 19:19.617
Captain Dittmar, yeah, and he was a white Anglo, I 
guess what you call an Anglo, and then his

18:59.033 --> 19:19.617
executive officer, I don't, I can't remember his 
name, but he was a, what was called the top first

19:20.491 --> 19:25.617
sergeant. He was real intelligent because he'd 
spent 20 years in the reserves already. And when he

19:34.547 --> 19:42.736
got to Vietnam, he knew quite a bit about 
amphibious operations. That's what I was in,

19:43.978 --> 19:47.882
amphibious operations. Okay, so when you did get 
there, your assignment was to help bring in

19:48.436 --> 19:53.923
supplies, right? Keep the infantry supplied with 
ammunition, food, and water, and also help them

19:54.443 --> 20:09.501
secure their perimeter. Whenever we'd move them 
deeper into the jungle, we'd use our vehicles to

20:09.621 --> 20:16.890
knock down trees, and clear a field of fire for them 
in case the enemy attacked them at night. They

20:22.157 --> 20:25.941
would have a clear, open field of fire.

20:27.122 --> 20:30.665
What did they ever told you about the Vietnam 
people, Vietnamese? I mean, had they ever said,

20:30.725 --> 20:34.009
well, the people are this way. You need to act this 
way. How were you told to treat the people, the

20:35.610 --> 20:41.076
citizens of the country? We were told to treat them 
with respect and not make fun of their

20:47.600 --> 21:11.206
surroundings or their homes or wherever they 
lived and to have as little as possible to do with

20:47.600 --> 21:11.206
them because our vehicles were highly 
susceptible to sabotage and we stayed as far away

20:47.600 --> 21:11.206
from them as we could so they wouldn't plant a bomb 
or something on our vehicles. Was there always a

21:11.287 --> 21:16.172
fear that they might have VCE or what was your 
biggest fear with them? Yeah, they were mainly

21:16.692 --> 21:27.181
pro-Viet Cong, and they would try anything to put 
us out of commission.

21:29.903 --> 21:40.252
But there's something about Orientals that, like 
a certain mystique, that I consider them a little

21:29.903 --> 21:40.252
weird. And

21:40.292 --> 21:46.277
I don't know, when I used to look at them and their 
slanted eyes, you know. It was just something

21:52.257 --> 22:01.007
weird I didn't like about it. And then their small, 
wiry frames. Most of them are small, wiry. And I

22:06.313 --> 22:11.960
just, a certain basic, like a repellent. They were 
a little repelling to me. I couldn't stand them.

22:16.705 --> 22:17.065
Really? Yeah. And it was weird to me because I grew 
up on the east side of town with black people and

22:18.526 --> 22:25.353
Polish people. And I surprised myself that I was 
feeling a little prejudice toward them, that I

22:25.413 --> 22:34.502
didn't like them. But I figured it was the 
indoctrination I received in the Marines about

22:34.522 --> 22:42.150
killing the Kong. that these Orientals all looked 
alike. So that you could never really distinguish

22:46.994 --> 22:49.557
if they were... Right. I had already grouped them 
and classified them because of my training. And I

22:54.742 --> 22:59.186
never could bring myself to lie. Did you ever go 
into any of their villages? Yeah. Another mission

23:04.111 --> 23:09.876
we had was to give them medical aid. And we'd take 
this team of doctors into a village, and we'd stop

23:10.801 --> 23:21.751
on the outskirt of the village and guard our 
vehicles while the doctors went in and treated

23:10.801 --> 23:21.751
them for whatever. They treated a lot of 
infections, ear, nose, throat infections, and

23:21.791 --> 23:40.369
there was a lot of malaria and stuff that the 
doctors would go into a village and treat these

23:21.791 --> 23:40.369
people. So mainly, I think my balance at the time, I 
started 50% of it was good, and then the other 50%

23:40.585 --> 23:53.717
was combat and stuff. 50% good, you mean like 
helping out the people? Right, mainly we helped a

23:55.839 --> 23:59.122
lot of people. So when you said you helped, did you 
just bring the doctors or you helped assist the

23:59.142 --> 24:02.905
patients? Well, if the doctors needed our help, 
we'd go ahead and help them, but... mainly like

24:08.817 --> 24:37.322
there was three crewmen per vehicle and we always 
went in teams of two vehicles we just when you had to

24:08.817 --> 24:37.322
guard this big 20-foot vehicle about 12 feet high 
and you know you had to spread out far enough to

24:08.817 --> 24:37.322
where you could watch your half of the vehicle the 
other guy watched the other half of the vehicle and

24:08.817 --> 24:37.322
another guy would be inside on the radios 
listening for any trouble. Did anything ever

24:40.354 --> 24:41.716
happen? Were you all ever attacked while you were 
in a village helping? Yeah, once in a while we'd get

24:45.080 --> 24:47.783
sniper fire.

24:50.907 --> 25:01.420
We'd get inside, close it all up because they were 
bulletproof to a certain caliber of weapon and the

24:50.907 --> 25:01.420
bullets would just bounce off because mainly Back 
in those days, the Vietnamese had carbines and

25:02.851 --> 25:07.716
small arms. They didn't drag around anything big 
or heavy enough to knock us out of action. And we'd

25:13.183 --> 25:17.988
go in the village, get the doctors, and then go on 
back to our area. And we'd report what had

25:19.289 --> 25:21.091
happened. There was this one sniper

25:22.553 --> 25:28.740
that was operating in our area, they called him the 
B.A.R. kid, and everybody was afraid of him

25:30.813 --> 25:34.977
because he carried a Browning automatic rifle. 
That's what B.A.R. stands for. And he had picked

25:37.720 --> 25:48.770
off a lot of people, a lot of Marines, because there 
was this one point where you come to this river, and

25:37.720 --> 25:48.770
there was a ferry. The Navy operated a ferry there. 
And the military, whoever was going to cross

25:51.413 --> 25:59.841
there, had to wait for the ferry, and that was when 
the sniper would would open up and kill people with

26:00.597 --> 26:23.466
his an automatic weapon with a 30 caliber range it 
has a lot of range and a real flat trajectory so he

26:00.597 --> 26:23.466
was really a good shot with it when you said they had 
the your enemy or whatever had small little

26:00.597 --> 26:23.466
carbines and Did that do anything to you? Like, you 
thought, well, they really aren't going to hurt me

26:24.739 --> 26:34.090
because they only have these small weapons and we 
have all this great, I mean, how much, what kind of

26:24.739 --> 26:34.090
military weapons did you have compared to them? 
And did you think you had more confidence because

26:34.150 --> 26:38.075
of what you had than they did? Yes, I considered our 
weapons better and more effective than theirs.

26:45.463 --> 26:52.491
But, like, they operated most of the time with the 
element of surprise in their favor. Like you never

26:53.078 --> 26:58.825
received a big advance warning of a big attack. 
Most of the time, we got ambushed, a surprise

26:58.845 --> 27:03.190
attack. So even if they had their small weapons, 
they had the element of surprise in their favor. So

27:11.260 --> 27:20.031
it was still worrisome to be over there, that 
constant. They had to be on constant guard all the

27:21.108 --> 27:28.498
time because that's how they did get their 
advantages by a sneak attack. So you didn't really

27:28.518 --> 27:30.981
underestimate them then, right? No, never did.

27:35.307 --> 27:37.530
Did you ever have any contact with Arvin? And if you 
did, what so? What were your impressions about

27:39.473 --> 27:41.095
Arvin? The Arvins were, you know, basically 
afraid and they were real young men. Their

27:52.846 --> 27:58.711
training wasn't all that good, and they lacked a 
lot of self-confidence. I guess because they were

27:58.731 --> 28:07.560
there a lot longer than we were all their lives, and 
they knew what their enemy was capable of. So there

28:07.640 --> 28:14.106
was a lot of cowardice among them, a lot of them. The 
way I knew this was our headquarters was right by an

28:14.146 --> 28:20.072
ARVN training camp. And every once in a while, we'd 
go and take supplies.

28:27.221 --> 28:29.685
Fresh water was hard to come by where we were at. So 
we had these big water trailers that we called

28:30.786 --> 28:39.678
water buffalos that would hold around 500 gallons 
of water. And we'd haul those around. And

28:42.021 --> 28:46.428
our duties were rotated. Every once in a while, it 
would be our turn to go and supply the armament And

28:51.760 --> 28:57.006
we'd start talking, because their instructors 
were the special forces, the green berets. And

28:58.427 --> 29:00.290
they'd be training them. And they'd tell us, we 
lost so many Arvin last night, they ran off with

29:00.310 --> 29:08.659
their weapons to join the Viet Cong. So I knew a lot 
more, because I covered a lot more territory. And

29:17.729 --> 29:21.193
then when we went on operations that we did carry 
the Arvin, One time we were going to drop them off to

29:22.405 --> 29:30.854
go patrol through this village and they didn't 
want to get off the vehicle. They were afraid. You

29:31.715 --> 29:33.777
mean like you stopped and they just wouldn't get 
off? Yeah. How did you get them off? We pushed them

29:35.879 --> 29:38.201
out and kicked them out. We threatened them and 
threw them out. What did you think once they got

29:43.927 --> 29:45.268
off? That they were going to turn around and go home 
or what? Well, probably... They'd probably just

29:51.076 --> 29:54.920
go and hide in the jungle and not fulfill their 
mission. Did you ever think that they really

29:56.561 --> 30:01.627
wanted this war, that they stood behind it? No, I 
don't think they wanted the war. And they'd be

30:07.773 --> 30:13.819
willing to swing with whoever was in authority at 
the time. They'd go that way. So they were with you

30:15.981 --> 30:19.605
mainly for the foods and the training? 
Protection, yeah. till we got kicked out and the

30:21.367 --> 30:28.394
North Vietnamese took over. What did you think 
about the Green Berets there? I thought the Green

30:31.798 --> 30:45.531
Berets were real effective and they weren't 
afraid of any situation they came across because

30:31.798 --> 30:45.531
we used to go and pick them up. They go out on their 
missions for months And then they'd radio in where

30:49.801 --> 30:53.106
they were at, and we'd go. Sometimes the only way to 
get there was by a river, because during the

30:53.887 --> 31:11.693
monsoon season when it rained all the time, we were 
the only ones that could operate helicopters, and

30:53.887 --> 31:11.693
planes couldn't fly in dense cloud, rainy type of 
weather. So we'd go and pick them up and bring them

31:12.314 --> 31:16.821
back from their missions, and we'd talk to them. 
And this one group had been out for a month, and

31:18.488 --> 31:38.811
whenever they would come across an enemy 
encampment, they would call in artillery fire or

31:18.488 --> 31:38.811
naval gunfire, whatever was available, and 
destroy that camp, and then pack up and run and

31:18.488 --> 31:38.811
hide. Because once the fire was called in on the 
enemy, they'd start looking for whoever was

31:38.931 --> 31:46.420
calling in the fire on them. And we would talk a lot 
with them. I thought they were doing a real good

31:52.553 --> 31:55.377
job, real effective. Did you ever have any chance 
or did you ever want to be a part of the Green Berets?

32:00.845 --> 32:02.007
No, not really. I was mainly content with being in 
the Marines. And we also worked with the toughest

32:05.592 --> 32:12.762
unit in the Marines is the recon. What is it? 
They're reconnaissance. They do almost

32:16.006 --> 32:17.368
everything. The same thing as the Green Berets 
did. They go out in the jungle and find enemy

32:20.341 --> 32:23.204
encampments. And they decide what kind of 
harassment they're going to do to that enemy.

32:32.152 --> 32:36.877
Either they call in artillery fire, naval 
gunfire, or aircraft. Or else they hide real far

32:36.897 --> 32:46.866
away and just shoot one of them to demoralize the 
others. You know, they'd stay hidden and then pick

32:47.335 --> 32:54.471
another one off and have a shocking effect on the 
others. To where they'd eventually, like,

32:54.811 --> 33:03.210
retreat or... Yeah, they'd get demoralized and 
wouldn't want to organize an attack against us.

33:05.014 --> 33:05.074
Um, When you were there and all these missions you 
went on, did you ever feel like there was a certain

33:06.303 --> 33:18.874
point you were going, you know, like a linear 
warfare, like your objective was to get up to that

33:06.303 --> 33:18.874
border and push them all the way back or what? No, we 
never had that kind of an objective. It was just

33:23.378 --> 33:25.780
what they consisted of. Yeah, it was, you'd take a 
hill one day and then you'd get orders to move on to

33:25.800 --> 33:35.348
somewhere else and forget about that area. Do you 
ever think, what's the point? Yeah, it got kind of,

33:38.484 --> 33:56.568
we all started wondering when the politicians 
were going to make up their mind to go ahead and win

33:38.484 --> 33:56.568
it, because it was like a cat and mouse game we were 
carrying on over. When you say the politicians and

33:56.588 --> 34:00.393
winning it, what did winning it mean? The 
politicians would do what? Agree to do what? Give

34:03.271 --> 34:14.082
us the orders to go ahead and invade North Vietnam 
and put them out of action and bring them under

34:03.271 --> 34:14.082
military control, our control. So

34:14.662 --> 34:29.477
what did, I don't understand because you feel 
that, did you feel you had the manpower and the

34:14.662 --> 34:29.477
equipment and everything to go ahead and invade 
North Vietnam and do away with it? Yes, when I was

34:29.797 --> 34:31.339
over there, We were, we had just built, this was the 
biggest air base in Southeast Asia. It was, had

34:40.407 --> 34:42.850
been built in July. It was a big landing strip for 
airplanes. And at night we would guard them. And

34:52.222 --> 35:00.533
then I remember when LBJ or Lyndon Baines Johnson, 
he started, he ordered the first bombing of the

34:52.222 --> 35:00.533
North, Vietnam. All day and night for a week, 
planes were landing, loading up, and taking off. I

35:09.415 --> 35:16.524
had never seen so many airplanes in my whole life 
getting fully loaded with bombs and everything

35:09.415 --> 35:16.524
and taking off. And this was 15, 20 minutes apart 
for a whole week, landing and taking off, landing

35:17.004 --> 35:26.215
and taking off. Like for 24 hours a day, this is? 
Yeah. I had never experienced that. I didn't even

35:32.120 --> 35:37.567
think we had that much air power. Why did he do that? 
Why did you think LBJ did that? To try and make them,

35:41.612 --> 35:49.362
bring them to their knees, make them give up, to 
break the will of the people. And did it to you, or

35:49.382 --> 35:51.225
what happened? No, it just made them madder, made 
them try harder. They dug tunnels and moved

35:55.610 --> 36:00.777
everything underground to get away from the 
bombs. Do you think that in any way that this

36:01.634 --> 36:09.302
bombing hit innocent people that weren't 
involved and got them turned against the U.S.?

36:09.322 --> 36:25.819
Yeah, I'm sure it did, because every so often in my 
past experiences, I've talked with pilots that

36:09.322 --> 36:25.819
were over there in Vietnam, and they'd say when 
they were going to make a bombing run, they would

36:09.322 --> 36:25.819
shoot these missiles at them, so they'd speed up 
and outrun the missiles, well, where's the

36:26.407 --> 36:31.374
missile going to go when it runs out of fuel? Back to 
the ground and blow up the same people that fired it

36:31.735 --> 36:36.322
at them. So not only were we bombing them and 
hurting their people, but the same weapons they

36:38.345 --> 36:48.961
used on us when they ran out of fuel would have to hit 
the ground again and explode or detonate. Did you

36:49.882 --> 36:55.030
ever know of any instances where the aircraft may 
have hit U.S. forces? Do you ever remember

36:57.630 --> 36:59.092
anything like that? Yeah, a lot of Marines that 
were wounded over there, when I was at Camp

36:59.112 --> 37:19.474
Pendleton, they would tell us that sometimes the 
fighting would get so fierce that they'd have to

36:59.112 --> 37:19.474
call in artillery fire right on their own position 
or aircraft. This one guy was telling me they were

37:23.410 --> 37:26.674
fighting this North Vietnamese Army unit. And 
they called in for aircraft support. And this F4

37:29.238 --> 37:32.002
was coming to help him. And he said that he didn't 
want to shoot because there was a lot of air

37:32.362 --> 37:36.628
turbulence. It was real windy that day, up in the 
high upper altitude. And they said, we don't give a

37:42.816 --> 37:45.420
heck where you hit. Just open up, shoot. And he 
ended up shooting five of his own fellow Marines.

37:53.178 --> 37:54.720
because of the air turbulence. A plane shakes a lot 
like that when there's air turbulence. How did

37:57.924 --> 38:02.310
that affect the men and the morale? Well, they were 
so besieged by this North Vietnamese army unit

38:02.330 --> 38:07.336
that they didn't care. It was either lose some of 
them, or this army unit would massacre all of them.

38:17.809 --> 38:23.016
So they'd rather sacrifice a few so that some of 
them would live. Can you describe what type of

38:23.384 --> 38:28.629
warfare you were involved in and different 
examples of your combat missions? Mainly what

38:30.951 --> 38:41.001
most of the fighting we did was at night

38:30.951 --> 38:41.001
on river patrols and beach guard. At night we would 
spread a whole platoon of tractors along the

38:42.322 --> 38:51.231
beach, say about 100 yards apart, and our mission 
was because the Vietnamese would fish every night

38:52.443 --> 39:19.615
off the coast and they had orders to keep one light 
aft and to stay

38:52.443 --> 39:19.615
not to come any closer than 500 yards to the beach or 
else we had orders to sink them because they were

38:52.443 --> 39:19.615
suspected of sneaking in weapons and explosives 
and stuff. So we'd spend the night watching them,

39:20.354 --> 39:26.963
and every once in a while, we'd get sniper fire from 
behind us. So we'd turn around and start some,

39:27.824 --> 39:38.919
every other tractor would turn around and start 
firing inland while the opposite was still

39:27.824 --> 39:38.919
watching the beach. So one night we were firing 
away, and we started getting even heavier fire

39:39.900 --> 39:44.426
back. So we got on the radios, and we found out that 
there was an infantry unit And we were hitting them

39:50.847 --> 39:54.571
with our fire. You mean it was the U.S.? Well, it was 
another Marine unit. And what had happened, this

39:59.577 --> 40:15.056
sniper had gotten between us, and the sniper would 
shoot at us, so he would draw our fire, and he knew

39:59.577 --> 40:15.056
that all our straight bullets were going to be 
hitting into that Marine base. Well, there are

40:16.357 --> 40:18.300
lots of examples of this. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it 
happened quite a bit. Especially at night, and the

40:21.205 --> 40:36.804
range of our weapons, machine guns, some Marines 
would just spray, shoot, and not aim at any

40:21.205 --> 40:36.804
particular target.

40:39.166 --> 40:43.872
And why was night warfare better than day? I didn't 
say it was better, but mainly those were the kind of

40:44.324 --> 41:01.084
missions we were stuck with because the enemy, all 
the enemy movements were at night because, you

40:44.324 --> 41:01.084
know, our airplanes couldn't find them and they 
felt safer under the cover of darkness. They could

41:02.686 --> 41:06.651
move a lot more heavy equipment. And then we had to 
patrol rivers at night that we thought the enemy

41:06.671 --> 41:13.099
was using to, to float cargo and ammunition.

41:18.992 --> 41:24.999
Because you could move faster on a river than 
through the jungle carrying stuff.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.842
But most of my missions were at night. The missions 
we did get during the day, we would move an infantry

41:27.982 --> 41:39.014
company deeper into the jungle or supply them with 
ammunition. Sometimes we'd be loaded with

41:39.094 --> 41:43.238
nothing but mortar shells, explosives. And then 
we'd be target, we could draw sniper fire from a lot

41:44.753 --> 41:54.503
further off because these huge amphibs could be 
seen miles away. And then the noise of our engines

41:55.464 --> 41:57.926
would give us away too. Were you ever in any 
hand-to-hand combat or could you ever like see the

41:59.247 --> 42:06.114
VC or who would you say, I mean how would you call 
your enemy? What did you call them? Usually VC or?

42:09.297 --> 42:09.818
Yeah. What names did you call them? The Viet Cong or 
Charlie, stuff like that. Or sometimes we called

42:20.765 --> 42:25.870
them, uh, uh, gooks.

42:28.513 --> 42:35.201
Yeah, a couple of times they were close enough to 
where we threw grenades at them. One time they were

42:35.621 --> 42:37.323
trying to sneak up on us. And we threw grenades and 
killed three of them. But it was very rare we got

42:45.740 --> 42:51.709
that close to them. Mainly, we'd shoot them pretty 
far off with machine guns and stuff. And then there

42:56.916 --> 43:01.623
was this one village.

43:03.366 --> 43:09.474
We were with this infantry company on this hill, 
and you could see down at this river valley and a

43:03.366 --> 43:09.474
village. And the infantry company, there was a 
little island in the middle of this river, and it

43:10.296 --> 43:15.443
was called Shark Island. because the ocean over 
here and every once in a while some sharks would

43:15.878 --> 43:22.188
come up that river. There was a lot of sharks in the 
China Sea and that's why they call it Shark Island

43:22.949 --> 43:34.807
because from that island every so often you'd see a 
shark. Well when the fishing boats were going out

43:34.827 --> 43:42.679
from that village they'd have to stop by that 
island and there was Marines there checking their

43:34.827 --> 43:42.679
IDs to make sure that the Viet Cong didn't sneak 
back and infiltrate. And then about 1 o'clock in

43:48.945 --> 44:05.542
the morning, they'd send a patrol in through that 
village to look and to make sure that Viet Cong

43:48.945 --> 44:05.542
weren't infiltrating or getting ready to mount an 
assault. And we'd be guarding our vehicles

44:06.543 --> 44:13.830
because the infantry, a lot of times, they would 
kind of like disown us. They said Amtraks, keep

44:14.367 --> 44:17.531
your vehicles away. If a shell hits it, it's going 
to blow up like a giant bomb and kill. So we'd have to

44:23.138 --> 44:27.223
be away from the infantry in our own little area. 
And we'd have to set up our own guard and take turns

44:28.264 --> 44:33.210
at night. And there's one particular night, this 
infantry patrol that went into that village, they

44:33.831 --> 44:44.104
started getting shot at real bad. a Viet Cong 
force, we didn't know how many in that village. And

44:51.225 --> 45:01.579
when they came up on them, so they were getting shot 
at

44:51.225 --> 45:01.579
pretty bad. And

45:01.599 --> 45:12.775
they called in for air support and these 
helicopters came and started You could see the

45:13.126 --> 45:18.494
machine gun fire like a red line just outlining the 
whole village. And the infantry was right in the

45:19.455 --> 45:22.359
middle of it. So they thought they had had it, and 
they started burning the whole village down and

45:23.040 --> 45:30.972
killing everybody.

45:37.862 --> 45:40.045
And it wasn't a pretty sight the next day. What did 
y'all have to do, go through it? Yeah, we had to go in

45:43.390 --> 45:46.073
there and get the bodies out. And whoever was left 
alive, we had to get them, you know, medical aid and

45:47.675 --> 45:54.543
stuff.

45:58.888 --> 46:00.990
It was pretty bad. Was it always just firing? I 
mean, what about napalm or any of those

46:02.312 --> 46:05.496
defoliants? Well, whenever there was a big, yeah, 
there was a lot of defoilant sprayed all around us.

46:11.429 --> 46:37.072
that Agent Orange, there was a, we were involved in 
a lot of experimental stuff too, like they were

46:11.429 --> 46:37.072
developing these smart bombs, and when they moved 
us up to the, just below the DMC, there was a bridge

46:11.429 --> 46:37.072
over this big river, it was called Nammo Bridge, 
and the Air Force was experimenting with these

46:11.429 --> 46:37.072
smart bombs. Those are those bombs that detect 
things? Yeah. Like one airplane will drop or

46:42.327 --> 47:00.376
they'll plant a transmitter on a bridge that they 
want to blow up, and this plane will come over and

46:42.327 --> 47:00.376
drop this bomb, and it locks in on that signal, and 
it will destroy that bridge. Well, they had picked

47:01.658 --> 47:08.689
this bridge to experiment on, and we were guarding 
it. And they dropped this one of those smart bombs.

47:11.937 --> 47:14.701
We could see it with a parachute coming down. And, 
you know, they didn't tell us everything about the

47:15.883 --> 47:18.967
experiment. But it blew over on the enemy, in deep 
enemy territory. And we had to go and get it back at

47:24.436 --> 47:26.799
all costs. Why did you have to get the bomb back? 
Because there was certain data inside of it that

47:29.443 --> 47:33.650
the Air Force wanted. So they could keep working on 
that bomb and in perfecting it or improving it. And

47:41.779 --> 47:45.465
we lost quite a few guys trying to get it back. You 
all did get it though? Yeah, we got it back. So when

47:48.711 --> 47:52.177
it went down, it was shot to mess up this bridge, 
right? But then you had a, what data? Well, it was

47:54.060 --> 47:58.848
like a dummy just gathering data. You know, I 
couldn't tell you exactly what it was, but...
