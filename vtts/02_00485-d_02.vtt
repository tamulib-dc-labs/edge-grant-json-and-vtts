WEBVTT

00:04.317 --> 00:14.555
You'll need more under present circumstances 
that can be provided by the raw materials that you

00:04.317 --> 00:14.555
now have in your inventory.

00:16.518 --> 00:25.854
So a determination has to be made of how much raw 
materials do you need in the long term? And what do

00:26.655 --> 00:28.198
you do about getting them? Because it's a very 
peculiar raw material, and it occurs in very

00:30.743 --> 00:44.516
minute quantities on the Earth's surface and in 
various forms. And it is extremely costly to get

00:44.536 --> 00:55.567
and refine to start moving.

00:55.587 --> 00:59.130
After a year's work on That problem, it became 
evident that we were going to have to have one of the

00:59.600 --> 01:14.256
largest searches for the material that anybody 
could imagine in the United States. And other

01:15.477 --> 01:18.421
places too, but primarily in the United States. 
And that several different processes were going

01:18.441 --> 01:29.573
to have to be developed to bring the material out of 
its whatever state that it was in. to uranium

01:30.818 --> 01:40.411
oxide, something that you could start to process 
in the system, and that this was going to be quite

01:30.818 --> 01:40.411
costly. Then plans had to be made and rules made, 
laws made, to, as a way of implementing it. And this

01:55.052 --> 01:59.458
is when there began to be rewards for uranium of 
various concentrations, and we got the miners and

02:00.232 --> 02:16.519
the prospectors all stirred up out west and going 
over the hill, and sure enough we came up with the

02:00.232 --> 02:16.519
materials. Did you work with the U.S. Geological 
Survey on this? Oh, we worked with everybody. Yes,

02:21.982 --> 02:28.851
them too, but mostly the AEC did most of it by 
itself. We worked with everybody. But there are

02:32.035 --> 02:35.098
all kinds of approaches to this. For instance, in 
Florida, there's enough uranium in the

02:35.118 --> 02:46.793
phosphates down there that

02:47.212 --> 02:49.796
was a substantial quantity of it. But to use it, you 
have to refine it in such a way that you come out with

02:49.816 --> 03:04.278
a different kind of phosphate fertilizer than 
you're producing from there now.

03:07.483 --> 03:09.827
So you have to re-educate all the farmers. to the 
use of the new kind of fertilizer before you could

03:11.917 --> 03:19.126
make the thing even approach being economical.

03:22.371 --> 03:30.922
So you do better to get your Randy Moore from some 
other sources, even though it's more costly, as

03:22.371 --> 03:30.922
long as you could do it. There are a number of 
projects, use that as one example, there are a

03:31.843 --> 03:35.848
number of problems like that. But we did develop a 
system that did get us the uranium we need. And

03:40.537 --> 03:42.019
where did we get it from? I thought we got our 
uranium from South America. I mean South Africa.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.246
South Africa, yes. We got quite a bit of the initial 
uranium from South Africa. And we're still

03:53.714 --> 03:59.381
getting some, at least as of the time I got out of the 
Patriot. But not a great deal. Most of it we get from

04:06.068 --> 04:20.283
my own west, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, a lot

04:06.068 --> 04:20.283
of the mines out there are still rolling. So that 
was one of the major issues. That was one of the

04:24.768 --> 04:26.910
major early things, yes. Of course, in the stories 
in the weapons development side of the thing that I

04:27.030 --> 04:33.257
really can't talk completely fascinating.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.881
All of the testing and whatnot. As of the time I got 
left AC,

04:42.901 --> 05:00.983
I had seen and witnessed more nuclear detonations

04:42.901 --> 05:00.983
than anybody in the world except one man who was in 
the AEC out there, or was in Los Alamos. And he's not

05:07.795 --> 05:08.816
dead. How many was there? Ooh, I don't know. I

05:13.101 --> 05:18.708
don't think I could even count them up. Most people 
say three, four, five, six maybe.

05:29.431 --> 05:33.956
I was probably somewhere around a hundred, I don't 
know exactly, but way up there. Well, we're going

05:34.216 --> 05:36.058
to talk about those. Some big ones. We're going to 
talk about those and of course some of the

05:38.260 --> 05:52.976
implications of testing underground and above 
ground, but let's go back to the job as executive

05:38.260 --> 05:52.976
director. What were some of the other issues 
besides finding uranium, and as far as how many

05:59.671 --> 06:05.219
bombs are needed? Well, the type of weapons,

06:06.621 --> 06:26.910
whether you build them for

06:06.621 --> 06:26.910
torpedoes, for example, whether you build them as 
bombs, whether you build them the other delivery

06:28.696 --> 06:45.316
systems that come in, like the V-1s, the Army's 
gun, all those things were being considered at

06:28.696 --> 06:45.316
that time, and they were

06:28.696 --> 06:45.316
pretty hard. Of

06:47.078 --> 06:55.007
course, the whole question of the Superbomb and 
the hydrogen bomb and whatnot all came up during

06:55.223 --> 07:00.831
that length of time. We got way over our head in 
cryogenics that we'd never been involved in

07:00.851 --> 07:08.362
before. What are cryogenics? Cryogenics is the 
science of low temperatures. Most all of the stuff

07:16.433 --> 07:24.184
in connection with the H-bomb at that time had to be 
handled minus 270 or minus 454 degrees

07:24.670 --> 07:30.595
Fahrenheit.

07:35.900 --> 07:50.694
Have these tremendous duars that are filled with 
liquid nitrogen that you have to use to keep it to

07:35.900 --> 07:50.694
this temperature and keep it filled and make your 
own nitrogen in the process and fly this stuff.

07:50.714 --> 07:54.137
It's a tremendous problem.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.943
I forgot the basic thing I was talking about. We're 
talking about the issues. So just the H-bomb

08:08.448 --> 08:17.438
thing, if that dominated the whole thing, would be 
enough to keep you more than occupied during that

08:08.448 --> 08:17.438
period of time. The testing, where can you test, 
how can you test, can you test above ground,

08:17.478 --> 08:26.588
underground,

08:27.513 --> 08:30.156
of the testing and the radioactivity. All of those 
were major issues during that period of time.

08:38.124 --> 08:55.883
Tremendous problems on going forward on nuclear 
airplanes and that nuclear ramjet was a real

08:38.124 --> 08:55.883
problem during that period of time.

08:57.955 --> 09:05.846
the time we had to acquire ARCO, Idaho, build that 
tremendous test station out there. The other

09:05.866 --> 09:16.001
thing that we were trying to get going on then, the 
peaceful uses of it, particularly reactors. We

09:16.321 --> 09:24.132
built the first reactors out there, and we built 
the first plutonium reactor out there.

09:25.428 --> 09:43.113
The expansion of

09:25.428 --> 09:43.113
the diffusion plants

09:25.428 --> 09:43.113
to produce U-235 was a major issue. The 
construction of additional reactors at the

09:43.234 --> 09:52.667
commission's facilities, particularly at 
Hanford, to produce more plutonium. That was an

09:54.200 --> 09:55.723
issue.

09:59.790 --> 10:04.840
Construction of Rocky Flats at Denver, another 
big one. I was wondering about the relations

10:04.860 --> 10:11.833
between the AEC and the Department of Defense. 
Well, overall they were generally not the best. or

10:18.702 --> 10:20.825
in the early stages. Not that there was something 
wrong with the people, but the whole philosophy of

10:20.945 --> 10:36.643
the United States at that time was to keep the 
military out of the atomic business, because

10:20.945 --> 10:36.643
everybody was scared of that. They were looking 
for a peaceful world where there were no atomic

10:36.663 --> 10:41.329
bombs or no atomic threats.

10:44.172 --> 10:46.735
All of which is great, but

10:48.942 --> 10:52.668
Most of us couldn't see it going that way. It just 
wasn't going that way. The United Nations were

10:55.853 --> 11:15.203
being organized, and one of my jobs when I was on the 
Joint Strategic Plan staff was to serve as

10:55.853 --> 11:15.203
assistant to the military representative to the 
United Nations, military staff committee of the

10:55.853 --> 11:15.203
United Nations. So while, and boy, if you talk 
about a frustrating experience, that is one of

11:16.027 --> 11:24.841
them.

11:24.861 --> 11:35.677
And so there were many of us that just thought that 
we had to get along, and it made no difference

11:24.861 --> 11:35.677
whether we belonged to or not. And we did, and 
worked at it hard. And some of the commissioners

11:40.565 --> 11:43.249
were,

11:46.958 --> 11:50.343
in a way, I mean, leaned in that direction. 
Anti-military? Well, not so much anti-military

11:52.787 --> 11:58.837
as they were going to put this thing peacefully to 
bed. They weren't necessarily discrediting the

11:58.877 --> 12:15.042
military, but some way this couldn't have this 
bomb in a military application way.

12:17.738 --> 12:33.761
Not all the commissioners felt that way, and since 
they worked hard to do their job, I have to give the

12:17.738 --> 12:33.761
commissioners credit, at least the early ones, 
because they worked real hard at it.

12:38.748 --> 12:47.020
But as it went on down the road, the major user that 
AEC had, had to be defense. There's all these other

12:49.008 --> 12:59.082
things, reactors, nuclear power, isotopes, all 
of the peaceful uses, all the wonderful things.

12:59.963 --> 13:01.065
They are wonderful. They're going to come, but as 
it turns out, it's going to take centuries rather

13:01.105 --> 13:13.041
than decades.

13:17.628 --> 13:25.037
And so pretty soon, you're in bed with the military 
whether you like it or not, because that's really

13:17.628 --> 13:25.037
all you're doing. And in the meantime, it's 
becoming urgently aware for

13:25.958 --> 13:39.434
everybody to see that it's essential for survival 
of the United States that you have a capability.

13:41.076 --> 13:45.762
And so as these things become apparent, then 
relations, of course, improved, improved,

13:46.130 --> 13:49.235
improved.

13:52.940 --> 13:59.891
So they got to the point where we're working 
together very real well, real well. At this time,

14:01.854 --> 14:14.533
in 1950, the North Koreans attacked South Korea, 
and I was wondering what impact that had on you

14:01.854 --> 14:14.533
people in the nuclear or in the atomic bomb 
business. I don't really think it had any,

14:16.083 --> 14:27.959
because we were already geared up doing whatever 
we were going to do. And the thing wasn't long

14:27.979 --> 14:43.120
enough,

14:27.979 --> 14:43.120
and the means used didn't impact us in such a way as 
to change what we were doing. I'm sure that it

14:45.698 --> 14:57.832
caused the planners an awful lot of worry, but of 
course I wasn't in the planning then, I was in the

14:45.698 --> 14:57.832
doing.

15:00.494 --> 15:09.765
So I don't think on the atomic side the impact was 
really, well

15:00.494 --> 15:09.765
there must have been some right this minute. I 
don't think of what it might have been. Okay. Of

15:14.070 --> 15:15.351
course, just a couple of years after that, we have 
the problem between the President and General

15:15.584 --> 15:20.650
MacArthur. And I was wondering, well, he made some 
statements about actually using atomic weapons

15:20.830 --> 15:31.863
and bombing in Manchuria, and I was wondering what 
the Air Force thought about that. I just don't

15:31.883 --> 15:34.686
know. I wasn't in the Air Force at that time, and I 
don't honestly know. but you were liaison

15:43.158 --> 15:56.573
between the Defense Department and the AEC, so was 
there any discussion, when he made statements

15:43.158 --> 15:56.573
like that, was there any discussion that you 
remember? No, not between those agencies, no. I'm

16:00.878 --> 16:09.267
sure there were plenty of discussions in the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and those places,

16:09.753 --> 16:14.418
that problem would not get to be a part of the 
military liaison committee. Okay. What was your

16:15.058 --> 16:20.604
personal opinion of firing the general? Well, I 
regretted very much that it had to happen, insofar

16:20.624 --> 16:29.233
as the specifics were concerned. I didn't know the 
answer, didn't know the fact, and so I just didn't

16:30.074 --> 16:39.203
have a proper opinion. I've always thought that, 
even in retrospect, that Truman was a little bit

16:40.212 --> 16:49.683
hasty.

16:52.486 --> 16:59.555
But also, I know MacArthur, and I can understand 
it. I sure can understand it. At this same time, of

17:04.400 --> 17:06.743
course, we have the McCarthyism and the Red Scare 
period, and most government officials, if not all

17:07.145 --> 17:17.807
government officials, were supposed to sign 
loyalty pledges. Were you supposed to sign one,

17:17.987 --> 17:20.272
and did you? Well, let me see.

17:25.803 --> 17:27.887
This program was started in 1947. I would have 
without any qualms at the time, but it didn't

17:29.487 --> 17:35.976
bother me either way. But I don't remember ever 
having to do it. I feel pretty sure that I never did,

17:41.503 --> 17:48.272
never had occasion to sign one. Senator McCarthy 
went after the Secretary of the Army, Stevens.

17:53.963 --> 17:58.970
What was your opinion and other general officers' 
opinion in the Air Force? People that you knew,

17:59.410 --> 18:01.574
your colleagues that you talked to. Well, most of 
us just thought it was a way of McCarthy

18:01.994 --> 18:15.694
making a splash.

18:17.227 --> 18:24.778
we thought Stevens had his shortcomings just like 
anybody else, but they weren't the kind of things

18:17.227 --> 18:24.778
that McCarthy was trying to prove. And of course 
our sympathy was all for Stevens and getting him

18:24.798 --> 18:30.887
cleared and back on his job.

18:33.671 --> 18:38.338
And I detested the McCarthy approach to the thing.

18:41.363 --> 18:41.864
I don't know. That brought into question the whole 
patriotism Yes, that's what it amounts to. Of

18:49.687 --> 18:54.033
course,

18:49.687 --> 18:54.033
that's not right. The armed services are 
patriotic enough. They'll stand.

19:04.189 --> 19:12.242
And we detested the whole damn thing, but there 
wasn't anything we could do about it except stand

19:04.189 --> 19:12.242
on the sidelines.

19:17.352 --> 19:19.955
In 1951 you switched jobs. Why was that? You became 
deputy chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons

19:20.896 --> 19:29.625
Project, a project which later in 1954 you became 
chief in which you stayed for six and a half years.

19:30.326 --> 19:31.588
Did you get two stars then? Well why did you switch 
and tell me about getting two stars.

19:42.850 --> 19:52.019
An Air Force officer on duty in Washington really 
should grow out of his job in three years.

19:55.422 --> 20:01.148
If he doesn't, maybe better start looking at him.

20:01.168 --> 20:09.516
And I was trying to grow, and I thought I had done 
about all I could do with the MLC job.

20:11.892 --> 20:33.474
By that time, the relationship between the 
Department of Defense and AEC had developed to

20:11.892 --> 20:33.474
such an extent that the Multilateral Liaison 
Committee wasn't really necessary anymore,

20:11.892 --> 20:33.474
except as a channel, as a conduit and a postdoc. And 
as a matter of fact, I had reduced the staff to

20:40.158 --> 20:50.072
recognize this and didn't have very much of a staff 
left.

20:50.092 --> 20:54.418
So, I thought it's time to get out and turn over to 
something else. The Armed Forces Special Weapons

20:54.458 --> 21:02.169
Project was the place I went as deputy commander.

21:05.554 --> 21:09.439
And it was a project born When the Atomic Energy 
Commission was created, there were a number of

21:09.706 --> 21:34.785
residual functions connected with atomic energy 
that need to or had to, as the case may be, stay in the

21:09.706 --> 21:34.785
military, in the Department of Defense.

21:36.335 --> 21:56.218
They set up this agency to take care of that and left 
General Groves in command of it and made it

21:36.335 --> 21:56.218
answerable to the three chiefs of staff 
separately, Chief of Staff, Army, Navy, Air

21:36.335 --> 21:56.218
Force. And it operated that way.

22:02.272 --> 22:31.873
It's had many jobs, but its two big jobs were to take 
the orders

22:02.272 --> 22:31.873
approved through the military liaison committee 
and the commission for weapons, and to see that

22:02.272 --> 22:31.873
they were produced in accordance with those 
specifications.

22:32.731 --> 22:56.072
and to determine any characteristics of the 
weapons that were necessary to determine in the

22:32.731 --> 22:56.072
process, to accept those weapons when they were 
produced, to take care of them and store them and

22:32.731 --> 22:56.072
have custody of them and keep anybody else from 
having custody of them.

23:01.047 --> 23:04.170
which turns out to be a pretty damn big order before 
you get through it. The other major job they had was

23:05.271 --> 23:26.790
to take whatever actions were necessary to 
develop a comprehensive handbook of the effects

23:05.271 --> 23:26.790
of atomic weapons on all kinds of targets and 
materials and other things.

23:26.810 --> 23:30.193
And so we handled all of the atomic weapons effects 
tests and participation in testing, military

23:31.203 --> 23:40.758
participation in testing.

23:45.024 --> 23:58.645
I had a headquarters in Washington in the Pentagon 
and a field command at Sandia Base in Albuquerque,

23:45.024 --> 23:58.645
New Mexico, adjacent to the Sandia Corporation 
out there. And then various weapons storage,

24:01.038 --> 24:11.188
repair, and rehabilitation places all over the 
United States that we built. I built five of them

24:11.288 --> 24:13.069
myself.

24:16.393 --> 24:23.519
And so I took over as deputy to General Loper, who 
was an Army general.

24:26.442 --> 24:27.383
So that first Two and a half or three years, I've 
forgotten exactly. Three years. And then he

24:34.076 --> 24:37.280
retired and I took it over.

24:40.704 --> 24:42.546
For another three years. And as of the time that 
Engine Charlie Wilson came into defense, he took

24:42.566 --> 24:59.226
it out from under the chiefs of the three services 
and put it under the Secretary of Defense. So I

24:59.577 --> 25:01.159
answered to him. And what difference did that 
make? I mean, did that make a difference? Instead

25:04.802 --> 25:09.186
of you being under the JCS, now you're under the 
Secretary of Defense? Yes, I wasn't under the JCS.

25:11.369 --> 25:13.511
I was under the services individually. Oh, you 
were under each service individually. Each

25:16.233 --> 25:16.494
service. I was responsible to the chief of naval 
operations, chief of staff of the Air Force, chief

25:16.514 --> 25:22.279
of staff of the Army. So it was probably a little bit 
more cumbersome then, wasn't it? Well, it really

25:25.565 --> 25:28.168
wasn't. If you've got the kind of personality and 
confidence to work in it, it makes it real easy.

25:39.363 --> 25:53.040
Because what you did is go and sit down and talk with 
them about their problems and write them a letter

25:39.363 --> 25:53.040
to tell them that's what you're going to do.

25:54.235 --> 25:57.539
an initial letter and sent it back to you and that's 
all you got. Well why did Wilson change it then? Was

26:00.503 --> 26:02.947
it an attempt to make it more streamlined? Well you 
may remember when he went in there there was a lot of

26:02.967 --> 26:14.762
talk about the military, the generals running 
every damn thing in Washington and why not. You go

26:14.802 --> 26:19.028
through these cycles all the time. Roger Kyes was 
his deputy. I don't know if you know him or not. No, I

26:26.411 --> 26:26.651
don't. How do you spell his name? K-e-y-e-s. Kyes, 
he calls it.

26:34.963 --> 26:39.009
He was in command of the Chevrolet division of 
General Motors. That makes sense. He came in as his

26:41.613 --> 26:47.682
deputy, and he ate General's breakfast, you see. 
far as the stories go.

26:55.570 --> 27:00.254
Great big guy, about six foot four I suspect, four 
or five. Ugliest man I ever saw in my life.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.602
Gruff, gruff as hell.

27:11.585 --> 27:12.646
But a real fine guy.

27:16.029 --> 27:17.010
Fine in what way? Well, he make a hell of a lot of 
noise and stir up a lot of things, but if he believed

27:18.847 --> 27:30.858
in you, and you said this is the way it is, by God, 
he'd go die for that. I

27:33.260 --> 27:46.272
had to go and see Wilson about something, and I've 
forgotten what the hell it was. I got to talking to

27:48.226 --> 27:51.632
guys while I was up there. And then he wanted a 
presentation about what this outfit did, what we

27:53.655 --> 27:58.683
were doing down there. So I told him I would be up 
whenever it was. He asked me sometime next day. And

28:06.035 --> 28:10.863
I'd have some charts showing where it fit in the 
organization. And I went up and explained the

28:11.244 --> 28:13.828
whole damn thing to him. He was so fascinated by it, 
because he didn't know anything about that

28:15.530 --> 28:27.427
business, that he called Wilson to come in and sit 
down and have me go through the whole damn thing

28:15.530 --> 28:27.427
again. So I took there a whole afternoon, a busy 
afternoon it was. At least for me it was.

28:39.845 --> 28:45.132
When I got through, Wilson said, I think that's 
something we ought to run from up here. I don't know

28:47.542 --> 28:50.467
what happened after that, but it was run from up 
there. It

28:50.968 --> 28:58.181
wasn't any real problem. I knew what the chiefs 
wanted and I kept them informed and I did that.

29:05.314 --> 29:07.137
There wasn't much argument about The real touchy 
part was, who had the weapons and were they being

29:08.112 --> 29:13.759
taken care of? And I knew the answer to that, so was 
everybody else. It

29:17.603 --> 29:22.909
wasn't a real problem. You had to be diplomatic, 
and you had to honor everybody's desires. If it

29:26.914 --> 29:30.778
fit, if it didn't, why tell them so? And they'd haul 
in. A real fine bunch of gentlemen to work with,

29:36.901 --> 29:39.665
anyway. Well, I want to talk a little bit about, can 
you tell me about Wilson? Engine Charlie?

29:48.940 --> 29:59.297
Well,

29:48.940 --> 29:59.297
from that point on, I got to know him better.

30:05.639 --> 30:11.625
spent some time with him on some of his long trips. I 
went out to, and we talked with him, to some of the

30:11.725 --> 30:19.514
nuclear tests. And it's a hell of a long ways out 
there. You can do a little bit of talking. Sure. And

30:25.520 --> 30:33.368
then saw him on strictly business, of course, 
quite often back here in the Pentagon.

30:37.651 --> 30:43.259
A real fine man, a very able man.

30:43.279 --> 31:04.249
We were beginning to get the kind of policies in the 
United States by the time he was in there that

30:43.279 --> 31:04.249
made it awful hard for a Secretary of Defense to

30:43.279 --> 31:04.249
really do the job. Because a lot of people want the 
Defense Department dismantled, and you have to

31:05.427 --> 31:18.784
fight like the devil for any kind of money that you 
need to do something with.

31:23.489 --> 31:32.260
And it became harder and harder and harder for him 
to get moving, to keep a defense establishment

31:23.489 --> 31:32.260
like he thought it ought to be. What kind of 
administrator was he? I

31:36.983 --> 31:46.874
guess that wasn't clear, except that he left most 
of it to Roger Kye. And Kye was pretty damn good, as

31:48.356 --> 31:55.163
long as everybody did what he told them.

31:55.183 --> 31:58.827
If they didn't, he fired them. And as long as they 
get by with that, well, that works. There are some

32:02.892 --> 32:04.513
people you can't fire. It gets to be a problem. And 
he hit that kind of problem. Well, when was that? In

32:10.536 --> 32:15.001
the latter part of the administration. He tried to 
fire a general? No, no, he could fire the general.

32:19.026 --> 32:20.868
That's what I thought. But he tried to fire a 
political appointee. Yeah, and he got crossed up

32:23.311 --> 32:26.615
with.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.062
What about General Groves? Well, Donald Groves 
was a,

32:35.050 --> 32:42.182
what about him and what kind of man was he? Yeah, 
what kind of man was he? What type of administrator

32:43.224 --> 32:45.027
was he? What type of relations did you have with 
him? He was a fine administrator for the kind of

32:48.913 --> 33:01.294
problem he had, and of course I guess that's the 
definition of a good administrator. I don't think

33:01.966 --> 33:21.895
that under

33:01.966 --> 33:21.895
the kind of problems we have administering 
something now, with a war not going on or no urgency

33:01.966 --> 33:21.895
or whatnot, he probably would not have shined as an 
administrator. But people had to do what he told

33:21.915 --> 33:26.783
them to do at that time and did. And he did, he told 
them the right thing. They did a hell of a good job.

33:30.772 --> 33:36.036
I'd have to say he's a very good administrator for 
the job that he had.

33:39.620 --> 33:52.831
And of course it was a very difficult job because of 
the kind of people that had to have working for you

33:39.620 --> 33:52.831
and the fact that it was all so secret that nobody 
could know anything. So I think he did a good job and

33:52.851 --> 34:00.137
was a good man. And I didn't know him until after all 
this was over and OPSWAP was created and he's head

34:00.708 --> 34:14.426
of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Party. In 
other words, in 1 January of 47, or late 46. I might

34:17.831 --> 34:21.576
have known him a little bit, but after that I did.

34:24.600 --> 34:29.787
And then I had him as my consultant and after he 
retired and left, both while I was in Ashwaub and

34:30.121 --> 34:40.634
later in the Atomic Energy Commission. So I got to 
know him quite well and I got to admire him. What did

34:45.019 --> 34:48.103
you admire about him? His absolute

34:48.924 --> 34:58.356
determination for one thing.

34:58.741 --> 35:06.190
If there wasn't one way to skin the cat, he could 
find some other one and do it. He believed what he

35:07.231 --> 35:12.237
believed and nothing shook it.

35:13.799 --> 35:27.735
He

35:13.799 --> 35:27.735
was persistent and worked at whatever objective 
he had in mind, really worked at it. And he was a very

35:29.302 --> 35:40.656
intelligent guy, somebody very interesting to 
talk to, interesting to discuss things with, and

35:29.302 --> 35:40.656
had views on everything.

35:43.780 --> 35:44.601
So I liked him. Now there's another man that I want 
to talk about, who although you at this time

35:45.482 --> 35:56.575
weren't involved in this, still and the Air Force 
itself you weren't that involved with. I'm

35:56.858 --> 36:02.763
interested in Curtis LeMay and the problems of the 
rise of the Strategic Air Command. You must have

36:03.784 --> 36:06.227
had some relations with LeMay. You must have heard 
stories about him or formed some opinion about him

36:06.267 --> 36:13.533
and the Strategic Air Command. There are even 
movies about SAC in the 1950s. It was glorified.

36:18.238 --> 36:19.979
What were your feelings about that? Well,

36:28.752 --> 36:33.902
I guess LeMay was a major, captain or major, when I 
first met him. And that was in connection with

36:36.508 --> 36:43.822
these navigation flights back in 1937 off the West 
Coast. And I didn't know him very well, but he was

36:51.348 --> 37:04.211
one of the four or five qualified celestial 
navigators that we had, as well as pilot and all the

36:51.348 --> 37:04.211
other things.

37:04.231 --> 37:12.546
He was entrusted with the secrets of the most 
secret thing we had at that time, a northern bomb

37:04.231 --> 37:12.546
site.

37:16.812 --> 37:23.419
And so I kind of held him in awe as a new second 
lieutenant. But then I didn't know anything more

37:23.439 --> 37:36.552
about him until

37:23.439 --> 37:36.552
the B-29s and I was in India in the position we've 
already talked about.

37:40.096 --> 37:45.942
And we planned and built for and accommodated the 
B-29 operations out of India, through China,

37:46.934 --> 37:53.984
against Japan, and back down that route. And, of 
course, LeMay was in command of that. So, I got to

37:59.613 --> 38:11.490
know him and deal with him in India

37:59.613 --> 38:11.490
quite a bit on

38:12.888 --> 38:27.405
Well, the mundane things, logistic support and 
how do you hell do you get gasoline to Chengdu, and

38:12.888 --> 38:27.405
how can we get Chiang Kai-shek to get another 
million coolies fixing the runway, and this sort

38:12.888 --> 38:27.405
of thing. I got to like him pretty well, but he's not 
the kind of guy you get close to, or that I get close

38:29.468 --> 38:41.983
to,

38:29.468 --> 38:41.983
anyhow.

38:44.849 --> 38:54.361
Then, back in Washington, he was there before he 
went to Tsai.

38:54.381 --> 38:59.327
And after, too, for that matter, but before, when 
he was there. We did a lot of skate shooting

39:01.609 --> 39:09.439
together, and I got to know him that way.

39:12.490 --> 39:27.507
Then when I was in MLC and later in AFSWAP, of course 
I dealt directly with him while he was in command of

39:12.490 --> 39:27.507
SAC, and I knew a lot about their problems out 
there. And while he disconcerts some people

39:28.048 --> 39:41.063
about, like his remark about Hanoi, I bet you back 
into the Stone Age, In retrospect, what better

39:41.903 --> 39:45.607
could you have done? So, I don't feel it's as crude 
as people feel it is. I think it's a little more

39:54.376 --> 39:56.478
reasoned than that. But he is a hard man, a damn hard 
man. He's a hard man to know. But he does mean what he

40:03.986 --> 40:11.033
says, and he made a fighting force that I think kept 
this country

40:12.177 --> 40:20.126
so it didn't have to go to war for a while. Because 
that's all we had. We didn't have another thing to

40:21.227 --> 40:25.091
fight with. And when you take it, those crews set up 
a third of them airborne at a time around the Boy,

40:37.844 --> 40:39.906
that is a killer. That is a killing operation. And

40:44.511 --> 40:57.886
he was able to do it, he was able to get his crews to do 
it, he got them to believe in it, and they did a very

40:44.511 --> 40:57.886
good job of it. And that's a good commander in my 
book. Now, of course, there was some problems

41:01.490 --> 41:05.134
between tactical air command and strategic air 
command. Were you at all involved with that? Well,

41:10.896 --> 41:14.863
yeah, but that's just a running thing that goes on 
all the time. It isn't really something to worry

41:14.943 --> 41:18.108
too much about, I don't think. It's real serious to 
the guy who isn't getting the money in that year's

41:18.729 --> 41:29.147
budget to get his airplanes, and he believes what 
he says and feels strongly about it and fights

41:18.729 --> 41:29.147
about it, and good for him. But it isn't really, 
they're not fighting each other's missions.

41:33.669 --> 41:37.213
They're just fighting for the resources they 
think they need to do their job. So I don't really

41:39.115 --> 41:42.138
pay much attention to those. Spike Mollmeyer had 
tack and got it organized and got it going. And I'm

41:50.166 --> 41:59.556
sure he had arguments with everybody, but he'd 
fight a circle saw if he needed to to get one more

41:50.166 --> 41:59.556
airplane or one more whatever he needed. to make a, 
make his command go. So, I don't think there's

42:04.910 --> 42:08.936
anything serious about those kind of fights.

42:13.764 --> 42:19.633
Well, I think that what we ought to do is, is stop 
here and get together again. Very good, very good.

42:21.817 --> 42:24.902
I am terribly sorry about the last time, because
