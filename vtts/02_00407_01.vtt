WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:07.485
And I was born here in Laredo, Webb County, Texas. 
My father is the late Mercury Martinez, who is

00:08.967 --> 00:20.103
originally from San Ignacio, Zapata County, 
Texas. And my mother came from the old town of

00:21.725 --> 00:29.316
Guerrero, Tamaulipas, Mexico. And her name was 
Cristina Treveño.

00:36.177 --> 00:39.403
You would like to have a little information about 
my father. About your father. All

00:40.324 --> 00:47.036
right. Yes, I'd like to know more about your 
father. Perhaps you could just begin with a short

00:50.101 --> 00:56.493
account of his life as you know it. Well, my 
father... was the son of Proceso Martinez, who

01:02.553 --> 01:31.362
married one of the original descendants of the 
original settlers of the old town of San Ignacio in

01:02.553 --> 01:31.362
Zapata County, Texas, by the name of Maria Jesus 
Uribe, who was the daughter of Don Jesus Uribe.

01:32.017 --> 01:35.441
My grandfather used to be a merchant. It is said 
that he was the one that originally introduced the

01:35.461 --> 01:49.860
plow and also the lantern into this South Texas 
area at that time by the fact that he was a merchant

01:35.461 --> 01:49.860
and brought in many of these things. Prior to that 
time, all they used were camels.

01:55.647 --> 02:01.855
My father was educated or received his... primary 
education in the old town of San Ignacio. And from

02:07.485 --> 02:23.569
there, and against the wishes of his father, Don 
Proceso, he decided that he was going to get his

02:07.485 --> 02:23.569
formal schooling by going to Austin, Texas and 
registering at St. Edward's University. Why did

02:24.130 --> 02:27.035
his father not want him to do that? Because at that 
time, they believed that They had more than enough

02:30.286 --> 02:31.988
work. They believed in the ranch life. And with the 
primary schooling that they had was more than

02:34.610 --> 02:38.333
enough. How many years was this? This was about 
eight, 10 years of actual schooling that he had

02:40.395 --> 02:46.260
received. So basically against the wishes of his 
father, but with the full support of a man that my

02:47.942 --> 02:59.112
father became very close to, and that was Mr. A.M. 
Bruni. And Mr. A.M. Bruni guaranteed his

03:06.224 --> 03:18.804
education, or at least if he needed any help, that 
he would make sure that he would provide him with

03:06.224 --> 03:18.804
the necessary funds, which he did. And I 
understand that after he got his education, my

03:19.065 --> 03:28.339
father was able to repay every penny that he 
borrowed from Juan Antonio at the time. But he

03:29.112 --> 03:40.483
decided to go to St. Edward's College, and he was 
able to get his what is referred to at that time as

03:29.112 --> 03:40.483
Master of Accounts degree. He graduated in 1898 
from St. Edward's College. From there, he came to

03:47.931 --> 03:57.060
San Ignacio, and he started teaching in the old 
settlement of Dolores in Zapata County. There he

03:57.935 --> 04:13.674
thought for about 10, 12 years, at which time he 
decided to get a little bit more involved in

03:57.935 --> 04:13.674
politics, and he ran for county treasurer, which 
he was elected. It was during this time, I

04:15.236 --> 04:26.389
understand, that the elections got so hot that my 
father had a prize on his head And they were gunning

04:27.263 --> 04:28.984
for him. Who was gunning for him? Well, some of the 
opposing candidates. What party did your father

04:35.290 --> 04:37.232
represent? Well, he represented the party that 
was being headed by the old judge, A.P. Spahn. And

04:45.939 --> 04:56.308
it got to the point that whenever he would go to bed, 
he would fix his bed in one corner, and after he

04:45.939 --> 04:56.308
would turn off the lamp, he would move his bed to the 
opposite corner just in case. And his horse was so

05:02.134 --> 05:06.678
well trained that it would follow him wherever he 
would go. And he used to relate one comment or one

05:08.140 --> 05:12.504
little story. He said one time this friend of his 
made a bet that if he would go through this

05:12.524 --> 05:24.657
particular house, that the horse wouldn't follow 
him. And he took him up on it. So he got off the horse

05:27.507 --> 05:35.504
and went into the main room, which was considered, 
you might say, the living room. The horse

05:35.824 --> 05:44.723
followed, went into the dining room, the horse 
followed, went into the kitchen, the horse

05:35.824 --> 05:44.723
followed, and on through the kitchen, and the 
horse was right behind him. That's how bad

05:45.361 --> 05:55.174
politics was at the time, and he just wanted to make 
sure that he had his method of transportation so

05:45.361 --> 05:55.174
he'd need to ride on all of a sudden. Where was he 
living during the election? Was he still in

05:57.316 --> 05:58.778
Dolores? He was in San Ignacio at the time. He had 
gone to San Ignacio. He had gone to San Ignacio. And

06:03.364 --> 06:10.393
after he got elected, of course, he went and lived 
in Zapata, the old town of Zapata. And he was there.

06:13.120 --> 06:36.370
for up until the time that he moved down here to 
Laredo, at which time he started working as an

06:13.120 --> 06:36.370
investigator and overall troubleshooter, 
including, I would say, bookkeeper, interpreter

06:13.120 --> 06:36.370
for the old law firm of Hicks, Hicks, Dixon, and 
Bobbitt. And this was in the 1920s, late 1920s.

06:43.765 --> 07:01.942
I think he still continued to have a very active 
role in the local politics, primarily in Zapata

06:43.765 --> 07:01.942
County, and he never really lost touch of it 
because people really respected him

06:43.765 --> 07:01.942
considerably. Probably I would imagine the 
reason why he loved politics so much is his father

07:02.943 --> 07:10.811
was a county commissioner for 30 years. That was 
Don Proceso. And then after Don Proceso retired,

07:13.280 --> 07:25.155
then his son, Proceso Jr., who was younger than my 
father, was elected county commissioner. And he

07:25.276 --> 07:29.561
was a county commissioner in Zapata for another 30 
years. So I guess this is part of the reason. The

07:33.246 --> 07:37.111
politics was in his blood, and he always lived it. 
But he related most interesting times So to go back

07:42.490 --> 07:48.816
to an earlier question, you said that A.M. Bruni 
helped him go through college. Now, how did your

07:48.876 --> 07:51.819
father get acquainted with A.M. Bruni? Well, when 
Don Antonio first came here from the old country,

07:53.380 --> 08:10.877
from Italy, my father used to buy quite a number of 
what we referred to as or skins for Mr. Bruni, who in

08:11.026 --> 08:16.552
turn, Mr. Bruni, would sell further up in the east. 
Were these cattle skins? Cattle skins and

08:18.173 --> 08:21.296
primarily cattle skins. And over the years, he was 
able to, and again, too, by the fact that my

08:22.838 --> 08:32.587
grandfather was a merchant in San Ignacio. He had a 
store in San Ignacio. This was also part of the

08:35.010 --> 08:40.155
friendship that developed over that period of 
time. And after my father got out or graduated from

08:41.266 --> 08:52.558
St. Edward's, this relationship continued. And 
on a number of occasions, as I mentioned to you a

08:53.719 --> 09:00.206
little earlier, my father was used. He was a 
go-between, you might say, to buy land for Tony

09:01.007 --> 09:06.953
Bruni. And this, of course, was done primarily to 
keep the original sellers or the original owners

09:07.861 --> 09:21.798
of the land from hiking the prices on that land. 
When they found that it was Bruni who was... Who was

09:21.818 --> 09:26.804
the one that was actually interested in buying the 
land. Yeah, well, tell the story about Bruni's

09:26.824 --> 09:30.088
land and their extent. Well, my father used to 
relate that Mr. Bruni had so much land that a man

09:30.541 --> 09:49.371
would start at the crack of daybreak, crack of 
dawn, ride on horseback, which was right on the

09:30.541 --> 09:49.371
edge of the river, and ride out all day long. And 
this would be hard riding on horseback. And it'd

09:52.900 --> 09:57.824
get dark, and he would still be riding on Bruny 
land. That's how much land A.M. Bruny had

09:57.865 --> 10:02.569
accumulated over his lifetime. As a matter of 
fact, when Mr. Bruny died,

10:03.510 --> 10:20.325
my father still had under his name, as you might say 
the owner, 5,000 acres of land. And nobody else in

10:21.014 --> 10:28.804
the family of Mr. Bruni knew about the acquisition 
of these 5,000 acres of land. But my father was so

10:28.824 --> 10:42.100
honest that after the funeral, he approached my 
father, approached the heirs, primarily Antonio

10:28.824 --> 10:42.100
Chico, as he used to refer to. And he told Antonio 
Chico, he said, listen, I have 5,000 acres that are

10:42.120 --> 10:50.110
under my name, but do not belong to me. I bought them 
with your father's money. And as soon as you have

10:55.383 --> 11:04.373
everything settled, let me know so that I can deed 
these 5,000 acres of land over to you and the

10:55.383 --> 11:04.373
family." And this is the type of honesty that he 
had. He just was very much what we sometimes refer

11:07.096 --> 11:14.604
to as a straight shooter. And it got to a point, 
especially later on, in actual documentation or

11:19.925 --> 11:47.974
knowledge for family trees and land titles that 
time and again my father was used to as a witness by

11:19.925 --> 11:47.974
both defense attorneys and counselors he was used 
as a key witness and none of the attorneys would

11:19.925 --> 11:47.974
ever challenge whatever he would say, you know, 
whenever he came, whenever he was put on the stand

11:48.342 --> 12:10.654
in land matters or land titles, neither party, 
neither party of either instance would ever

11:48.342 --> 12:10.654
challenge him because that's how well versed he 
was and that's how well respected the respect that

12:11.056 --> 12:18.630
he had from all of the attorneys, because they knew 
that whatever he would say was actually the actual

12:11.056 --> 12:18.630
truth. And through his testimony, there were many 
land titles that were settled and never

12:20.152 --> 12:31.613
challenged, primarily on his say-so, on his 
words. How did he happen to become involved with

12:32.420 --> 12:37.367
this Laredo law firm? Was there an incident that 
led to this? The incident that led to this was that

12:41.893 --> 12:57.195
his older brother, who used to have a creamery, 
used to have San Andres Dairy at the time. Which

12:57.293 --> 12:58.414
brother was this? This was a brother by the name of 
Serafin. Excuse me, not Serafin. It's an older

13:05.663 --> 13:07.085
brother. Adolfo, excuse me. Adolfo Martinez. And 
one early morning when he got up to milk the cows,

13:11.950 --> 13:22.643
and he stepped on a puddle. And while he was on the 
puddle, he went on to turn the light. So he got

13:26.531 --> 13:28.353
electrocuted. So my father, who was in Zapata at 
the time, came over and started doing some

13:29.835 --> 13:44.312
investigation work in order to bring his 
findings. And he used the law firm of Hicks, Hicks,

13:44.332 --> 13:47.736
Dixon, and Bobbitt. And the firm was so impressed 
in the manner that he conducted this

13:48.897 --> 14:09.895
investigation that Mr. Bobbitt, Judge Bobbitt, 
Robert Lee Bobbitt, as a matter of fact, and Yale

13:48.897 --> 14:09.895
Hicks, they offered him a position with the law 
firm. Of course, after that, he worked for 20 years

14:09.935 --> 14:14.579
with the law firm. And during this time, he was used 
to a great extent to investigate family trees and

14:18.901 --> 14:23.727
land titles. And it was during this time that he got 
to learn even more so about names, dates, places,

14:24.387 --> 14:32.457
family trees. And this, to him, was a school in 
itself, as he used to make reference. And after

14:41.948 --> 14:48.756
that, there were many people that thought that he 
was an attorney, which in fact he was not. But they

14:49.040 --> 14:54.970
would always come to him for all simple wills and 
deeds of trust. Well, he was a notary public. He was

14:56.372 --> 14:58.776
a notary public. But he definitely was not an 
attorney, even though many people still think

14:59.277 --> 15:04.786
that he was. But he did acquire this association in 
the mind of his friends and relatives. That's

15:11.918 --> 15:13.140
right. helped them, apparently, with quite a bit 
of legal work. To go back again to some of the early

15:18.862 --> 15:30.133
history, one of the questions that I had was about 
your father's first wife, not Guadalupe Uribe,

15:18.862 --> 15:30.133
his second wife. But the first- Maria Uribe, who 
was a sister of Guadalupe Uribe. They were both

15:37.300 --> 15:42.705
sisters, and they were first cousins of my father. 
And

15:42.938 --> 15:51.112
she died right immediately after childbirth. 
There was only one reference. There was one child,

15:52.795 --> 15:58.865
the baby, of course, that died a few weeks later. 
And then he married. How long had they been

16:02.472 --> 16:03.934
married? for a relatively short period of time. 
Short time. This was the first child. The very

16:07.977 --> 16:08.919
first child. Maria died. I would say probably just 
over a year at the most. Did he ever talk about that

16:12.244 --> 16:13.987
at all? Very little. He didn't write it into his 
papers either. No. And then he married this other

16:18.654 --> 16:24.222
sister who was the oldest in the family. She was 
several years older than he was. Quite a number of

16:27.007 --> 16:30.512
years older.

16:31.066 --> 16:35.373
He was married to her or lived for several years, 
quite a number of years. As a matter of fact, they

16:38.035 --> 16:46.244
They were the ones that moved over from Zapata 
County to Laredo and built the house on 416

16:38.035 --> 16:46.244
Lincoln. It was in the late 1920s. Do you live there 
now? That's where I presently live. At 416

16:52.771 --> 16:53.612
Lincoln. I just wondered. Yes, ma'am. So that's 
the mother house, you might say, or the father

16:56.956 --> 17:00.860
house. The father house. And after she died, then 
she married my mother. How did he meet your mother?

17:09.103 --> 17:29.878
Well, my mother came from Olzapata to work for my 
father because my father, well at the time, that

17:09.103 --> 17:29.878
my aunt Lupita was sick, she was extremely sick, so 
she came over to care for her. And after she died, my

17:30.736 --> 17:34.822
aunt Lupita. Your father's second wife. My 
father's second wife. Right, okay. And we call her

17:39.709 --> 17:43.114
Tia Lupita. But anyway, this is how the 
relationship started. And after she died, then a

17:48.642 --> 17:53.849
short while later, my father married my mother. 
Were they also kin? No. Well, probably they were

17:58.707 --> 18:04.996
kin, but there were quite a few distantly related. 
Quite a few degrees. In other words, practically

18:09.201 --> 18:17.512
everybody from San Ignacio and Guerrero all 
through there is connected in one way or another.

18:17.532 --> 18:18.173
One way or another. The relationship came from the 
Gutierrez family because my mother was a

18:18.654 --> 18:24.722
Gutierrez, so. That's where that relationship 
came from. And out of that union, only my sister and

18:30.662 --> 18:37.409
I were born. Now, your mother, Christina, had been 
married once before, had she not? She had also been

18:42.575 --> 18:44.617
married twice before. But she only had a child from 
one of those marriages. And so I have a

18:50.303 --> 18:53.106
half-sister. Where does she live? She's 
presently living in Corpus. While I'm thinking

18:58.507 --> 19:01.270
about it, where's Rosa living now? Rosa is living 
right across from where I live at 413 Lincoln

19:01.290 --> 19:06.776
Street. Has she married? No. No, she says that 
she's not about to support somebody.

19:15.526 --> 19:17.489
She's two years younger than I. At least her 
intentions right now are not too bad. What year

19:20.913 --> 19:22.114
were you born? I was born in 1937, July 25. You're 
exactly one year younger than I am.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.572
Is that right? All right. Well, let's see. There 
were several things that I particularly wanted to

19:36.035 --> 19:38.678
ask. Oh, while I'm thinking about it, I don't have 
the date of your father's death. When did he die

19:43.704 --> 19:46.988
exactly? I don't have it with me. And I'm afraid I 
cannot. Like I say, I'm not good at dates. But I'll

19:53.515 --> 19:57.180
find out, and I'll be more than happy to tell you 
about it. All right. What year was it? 1966. 1966. I

20:01.405 --> 20:03.588
wasn't sure of that either. But you can write me 
about it. Just 10 days before he was to complete his

20:07.793 --> 20:13.259
90th year. So he was 89 years old. 89, just 10 days 
shy of 90. 90 years old. This was in August. I'm

20:25.280 --> 20:28.565
afraid I can't, I don't recall the date. Well, the 
men in your family are notably long-lived. I'm

20:31.389 --> 20:34.754
afraid they are. Judge. The oldest, well, the 
latest one that died, let me put it this way, he died

20:35.155 --> 20:47.653
just about a little better than a year almost two 
years ago. And he was almost 98 years old when he

20:50.749 --> 20:55.635
died. Which one was that? Who was older? And that 
was one of your father's brothers? Brother, who

20:59.760 --> 21:01.421
was older than my father. So it's true. I mean, 
they're a strong fiber. You've got good genes for

21:08.430 --> 21:11.413
staying around a long time. Well, back to your 
father, after he retired from the law firm, one of

21:12.203 --> 21:23.724
the things he apparently did was work for the 
Boundary Commission. Could you tell me a little

21:24.646 --> 21:28.653
bit about the nature of his work with the Boundary 
Commission? Well, this was during the time that

21:28.954 --> 21:35.005
the International Boundary and Water Commission 
was going to build Lake Falcon. and they needed

21:36.183 --> 22:04.114
somebody that was well-versed with the families 
in the affected area that was well-versed with the

21:36.183 --> 22:04.114
titles land titles and also that was well-versed 
with the family trees within the area and because

21:36.183 --> 22:04.114
of that and of course by the fact that my father was 
already up in years he was already in his 70s They

22:04.769 --> 22:12.299
waived their requirement that they have to go 
through for civil service. And he was hired. And he

22:14.162 --> 22:22.013
conducted a considerable amount of 
investigation with regards to who should be paid

22:14.162 --> 22:22.013
and the amounts. And he was also the arbiter. He 
would come in as far as the settlement of many of the

22:25.577 --> 22:31.806
lands the different families and the different 
heirs. And through him, and primarily because of

22:37.070 --> 22:46.961
him, the greater part of all of that acreage was 
finally settled. Because he was a type that would

22:47.261 --> 22:57.793
devote a considerable amount of time to detail. 
And he was very meticulous and he would trace it all

22:58.246 --> 23:14.702
the way from the original grand tour in order to 
prove his point as to who was the original or the

22:58.246 --> 23:14.702
owner that should be paid or that settlement 
should be made. Well, in some cases, have these

23:15.138 --> 23:18.463
lands simply not been subdivided? That is 
correct. They were still being held in common by

23:19.704 --> 23:23.570
all the descendants? Exactly. And this is where my 
father's, I would say, invaluable knowledge came

23:24.271 --> 23:31.160
through. And there was a number of occasions I know 
that I myself personally would drive him to many of

23:31.180 --> 23:41.314
these old ranches where he would conduct personal 
interviews in order to clear a particular error or

23:41.767 --> 23:54.479
in order to find who the other issues were within 
the family. And in his reports, many times he

23:55.620 --> 24:05.549
provided family trees, which he would in turn turn 
over to the International Boundary Water

23:55.620 --> 24:05.549
Commission. So his help proved to be invaluable in 
trying to make final settlement for the Falcon.

24:15.761 --> 24:19.005
Now how did he feel about the Falcon situation? Do 
you remember? He believed in it because he felt

24:20.567 --> 24:30.201
that this would bring in a boom to the area which 
Let's face it, the agricultural economic area had

24:30.535 --> 24:43.634
been going down considerably, and he felt that the 
lake would provide particularly a tourist

24:30.535 --> 24:43.634
industry, which in effect it has. And 
consequently, this is one area that he believed

24:44.776 --> 24:48.140
quite strongly. The only one that he opposed, and 
he was able to oppose quite favorably, was the

24:48.781 --> 24:59.597
moving of San Ignacio.

24:59.898 --> 25:04.542
Again, primarily through his efforts, San 
Ignacio was left there. And I'm glad that it was,

25:05.383 --> 25:20.737
because all of the original houses, stone houses, 
like the old fort where they used to find Indians,

25:05.383 --> 25:20.737
and the original settlements, all of that 
definitely has been preserved. And he was the one

25:21.778 --> 25:29.905
that was initially contacted to get the 
International Boundary Water Commission and

25:30.745 --> 25:35.110
change its plans, which they did. Now, what was his 
particular reason for justifying the salvation

25:35.130 --> 25:40.417
of San Ignacio? Well, to a great extent, of course, 
he used the historical interest. And then he used

25:45.463 --> 26:00.702
the surveys that were done by the Boundary 
Commission as far as the altitude, which, let's

25:45.463 --> 26:00.702
face it, San Ignacio is in a much higher area, or the 
altitude there is much higher than the old Zapata.

26:01.103 --> 26:03.166
So it really wasn't going to be submerged. Not at 
all whatsoever. It has never been, not even in the

26:04.467 --> 26:15.762
latest flood, which was in 1954, and it was proven 
because it definitely did not reach San Ignacio. I

26:15.782 --> 26:21.289
mean, it was around it, but it didn't get at San 
Ignacio. So his point was well taken and well

26:21.309 --> 26:24.934
proven. Now, a lot was said. One of his very 
convincing arguments that he's left in his papers

26:28.124 --> 26:42.973
was that the terrible hardship that would be 
created by these people if they had to leave the

26:28.124 --> 26:42.973
homes of their ancestors and if they had to give up 
their lands that were along the river. Now, this,

26:45.797 --> 27:07.472
of course, was certainly very poignant, and he 
also pointed out that many of them might end up

26:45.797 --> 27:07.472
just, you know, going elsewhere, and maybe they 
couldn't even make a way for themselves, and he

26:45.797 --> 27:07.472
talked about their independence and this sort of 
thing, but to turn this around, this, of course,

26:45.797 --> 27:07.472
was true for San Ignacio, but what about the people 
of Old Zapata? Were they as socially disrupted as

27:10.797 --> 27:13.882
He argued the people of San Ignacio would have 
been. You must keep in mind that old Zapata had

27:13.982 --> 27:21.815
already been moved about two different times 
prior to that. So, in effect, we were not really

27:22.395 --> 27:26.402
talking about the original settlements. Because 
prior to that time, there used to be what they would

27:27.203 --> 27:34.054
refer to as the Carrizo. which was later changed to 
Zapata. And it was even further downriver. So in

27:39.578 --> 27:47.926
effect, we're not talking about a town that had the 
historical meaning that San Ignacio has. And

27:49.007 --> 27:59.738
true, there were some old stone houses there, but 
it definitely did not carry the historical

27:49.007 --> 27:59.738
background of San Ignacio. And to this extent, 
that's why we really did not carry the impetus or

28:00.072 --> 28:11.997
the catalyst or the influence that San Ignacio now 
definitely has. This is the main, main reason why.

28:14.990 --> 28:27.089
There was some talk at the time of putting, or at 
least some people in San Ignacio, excuse me, New

28:14.990 --> 28:27.089
Zapata, wanted to put two dams on the Rio Grande 
which would lower the level of the lake. Do you

28:27.149 --> 28:31.075
remember where your father stood on that 
particular issue? Because they were the two

28:31.139 --> 28:39.009
proposals, one to just keep the level, build a 
lower dam and another one upstream and save old

28:31.139 --> 28:39.009
Zapata too. Well, I'm afraid that I don't recall 
any comment from him along those lines. Well, that

28:43.795 --> 28:46.539
was rather, that was in the late 1940s. That was a 
little earlier. I didn't start really helping him

28:49.262 --> 28:55.290
out until the 1950s when he was actually hired. 
Because he was hired by the Boundary Commission in

28:55.270 --> 29:07.766
the 50s, after he already had retired in the 40s 
from the law firm of Hicks, Hicks, Hicks, and the

28:55.270 --> 29:07.766
Boundary. Yes, ma'am. So you were in your early 
teens. Yes, ma'am. When you were, well, not that

29:13.293 --> 29:16.577
early teens. No, 1953. In 1953. You were 16 or 17. 
Just about. I was already in high school at the

29:22.564 --> 29:24.687
time. Well, your father, in his work with the 
people down there, did he do anything to make the

29:26.219 --> 29:35.072
transition any easier for them that you recall, 
the ones who did have to move? Yes, and because of

29:36.193 --> 29:50.855
his influence and because of the trust that they 
had in him, that he was able to influence many of the

29:36.193 --> 29:50.855
people that didn't want to move from their 
ranches.

29:53.599 --> 29:55.281
I don't know, I guess... We must keep in mind that my 
father, who

29:56.476 --> 30:06.694
most, I mean, they had deep respect for him. And 
normally, what he would say, they wouldn't

30:07.655 --> 30:11.582
challenge. Again, his influence was used by the 
government to a very great extent, and he was

30:12.203 --> 30:30.119
definitely instrumental in getting many of these 
people moved out from their ranches and from their

30:12.203 --> 30:30.119
old settlements.

30:32.882 --> 30:41.890
Well,

30:32.882 --> 30:41.890
he wrote a corrida called The Ballad of Old Zapata, 
which is a very beautiful piece of work, full of the

30:42.359 --> 30:51.192
emotional trauma of having to uproot even from old 
Zapata. Did he write many other things like this?

30:53.575 --> 30:53.995
He did. And as a matter of fact, I have some 
compositions of his over at my home. And I only wish

31:02.327 --> 31:08.196
I had the ability to recite them as well as he did. 
But they are written. And he does have them in his

31:11.924 --> 31:15.327
own personal handwriting. And again, that 
flavor, that emotion does come through along

31:16.388 --> 31:23.355
those lines. Well, in the difference between 
Spanish and English, do you feel that he used the

31:24.296 --> 31:32.144
two different languages differently? True, I 
would say so, because, I don't know, there seems to

31:34.085 --> 31:40.952
be a little bit more flavor The adjectives are a 
little bit more meaningful in Spanish, and of

31:41.590 --> 31:54.705
course the fact that that's his native tongue, he 
had

31:41.590 --> 31:54.705
more... direct contact with that particular 
language. Spanish is the first language he

31:58.620 --> 32:00.442
learned. That is correct. When he went to school in 
San Ignacio, was education there in English or

32:01.644 --> 32:07.952
Spanish or both? Or do you know? It was mostly in 
Spanish. Mostly in Spanish. So they were actually

32:11.236 --> 32:12.898
being taught. Bilingual education is not new. 
That's right. At least not as far as he was

32:16.062 --> 32:18.465
concerned. And did he learn some English in school 
there, or did he learn English later? Some

32:23.732 --> 32:23.993
English. Some English. Not that much. He really 
didn't learn it until he went over to St. Edward's

32:25.855 --> 32:31.363
at Austin. In which language would you say he was 
the more fluent? Or was he equally fluent? He was

32:36.210 --> 32:46.765
equally fluent in both because he had the ability, 
while reading English, he was reading it, you

32:36.210 --> 32:46.765
might say, how shall I say, silently. But as he was 
reading it in, let's say, English, he was actually

32:49.711 --> 32:59.086
saying it out loud in Spanish. And vice versa, he 
would read something in Spanish, but he would be

33:00.108 --> 33:06.138
reading it out loud in English. He really was quite 
fluent in both, which is something that I never was

33:06.659 --> 33:13.630
able to acquire. I haven't either. But he was quite 
instrumental. And I guess that's the reason, too,

33:19.287 --> 33:25.959
why a number of times he was used as a court 
interpreter, because he was fluent in both. Well,

33:26.540 --> 33:28.884
what language did you grow up speaking at home? 
Spanish. My mother didn't know any English at all,

33:30.607 --> 33:36.718
so all we spoke at home was Spanish. And not until, 
well, the The time that we went to school, all my

33:40.070 --> 33:44.383
formal schooling is in English. I never got any 
formal education in Spanish. But at home was

33:49.357 --> 33:51.784
strictly Spanish. How did your father, and he was 
as I see him, of course, and I'm interpreting him

33:53.755 --> 34:16.540
from his papers, but he strikes me as being a man who 
in some ways lived in two worlds, very much a part of

33:53.755 --> 34:16.540
what you might call the Anglo-North American 
United States world, also very much a part of what,

33:53.755 --> 34:16.540
of course, was also the United States, but had been 
part of Mexico since he was very much a native

34:16.874 --> 34:24.765
Texan, but still one with much more of a 
Spanish-Mexican culture. Do you feel like he

34:25.145 --> 34:30.853
synthesized these worlds in his personality, or 
did he see them as two different worlds? And I'm

34:31.594 --> 34:33.637
being a little introspective here. That's a hard 
question to answer, but I, as far as I was

34:35.299 --> 34:43.590
concerned, he felt very, very much at ease. in the 
situation. He was definitely never the type to, I

34:46.737 --> 34:54.885
don't think, he ever felt that he was ever 
discriminated, let's say. On the contrary, he

34:54.925 --> 35:03.234
always had their respect, or everybody's 
respect, for that matter. They always referred to

35:03.334 --> 35:07.679
him as Don Mercurio, with the utmost respect. Of 
course, as far as I was concerned, to me, He was

35:11.212 --> 35:17.740
already quite elderly when I finally gained some 
kind of reason. And by that time, of course,

35:19.082 --> 35:26.652
everybody knew him, and he was very well 
respected. And regardless of who it was, the

35:28.194 --> 35:38.688
respect always was there, including by my mother, 
who used to call him Don Mercurio. Don is being

35:38.708 --> 35:40.510
very... how shall I say, with the utmost respect. 
In address of honor. In address of honor. There you

35:45.648 --> 35:46.109
are. Well, is this partly the Laredo situation? Do 
you think Laredo is different, say, from other

35:49.132 --> 35:52.576
towns on the border? I would say so. How would you 
say it's different? Because I don't,

35:56.921 --> 36:11.037
Laredo, I have never been exposed as such, you 
might say, outside of the Laredo, other than the

35:56.921 --> 36:11.037
times that I've been working on my well, former 
schooling when I was doing graduate work outside

36:11.860 --> 36:24.614
of Laredo and North Texas and in Colorado and even 
in Massachusetts. But

36:25.755 --> 36:34.124
by the fact that we've never been exposed to any 
kind of discrimination, we don't look for it. We

36:35.185 --> 36:41.091
don't have a chip on our shoulder, and 
consequently, we just don't believe in it.

36:41.560 --> 37:10.774
because we haven't been exposed to it i would 
imagine well now do you think that's partly

36:41.560 --> 37:10.774
because of the influence of men like your father in 
the early history i'm sure that that is the case you

36:41.560 --> 37:10.774
definitely don't see it here in the right no you 
don't see it no not at all and uh this is this is

36:41.560 --> 37:10.774
something this will help me understand your 
father better perhaps that this particular

36:41.560 --> 37:10.774
situation in laredo was there any historical 
reason that this that it happened this way that

36:41.560 --> 37:10.774
there was a kind of synthesis I would imagine one

37:11.513 --> 37:23.433
time I went into some kind of discussion along 
these lines when I told him that I didn't believe in

37:11.513 --> 37:23.433
this discrimination bit. And to as far as I was 
concerned, it didn't exist. It still doesn't. And

37:30.444 --> 37:37.656
this individual told me, yes, but you must keep in 
mind that your background is entirely different

37:38.243 --> 37:52.258
by the fact that you came from people that 
inherited land, that were well-respected, that

37:38.243 --> 37:52.258
had the image of supposedly cultured people. And 
consequently, the kind of an attitude that you

37:53.420 --> 38:02.009
received was probably very, very different than 
from other families. That might have been the

38:02.049 --> 38:03.010
case. I don't know. So he was arguing that it's your 
family situation rather than Laredo itself that

38:03.877 --> 38:08.904
is different. That's what he was arguing. But you 
wouldn't agree with that? I definitely do not,

38:12.008 --> 38:29.631
because I know even close friends here that did not 
have or does not have the, did not inherit, let's

38:12.008 --> 38:29.631
say, land or things along these lines, and they do 
not have that kind of an attitude. It was quite

38:31.703 --> 38:35.389
different in El Paso, and I was surprised. I did not 
know that for El Paso, but apparently there was a

38:35.550 --> 38:49.974
tremendous amount of discrimination in El Paso 
and directed toward people who were from good

38:35.550 --> 38:49.974
families, so this would tend to support your 
argument. What about further down in the valley?

38:53.017 --> 38:57.641
What do you know about those towns, say, to compare 
them, in this respect, with Laredo? I'm afraid I

38:57.902 --> 39:01.585
have never been, I've never lived in the valley. 
Just going through it, the extent of my knowledge

39:02.466 --> 39:14.277
would be Zapata in Zapata, Texas, and that would be 
about as far as that situation is concerned. But

39:14.297 --> 39:19.902
isn't that really part of the Laredo culture, if 
you will, Zapata culture? Very much so, with

39:20.438 --> 39:22.320
Laredo. Is this the case? Or with the valley you're 
talking about? No, I mean Zapata ties in more with

39:27.005 --> 39:29.527
Laredo. Very, very much. Zapata ties in very 
strongly because the greater number of the people

39:30.829 --> 39:42.961
from both of these towns, they came from the old 
Guerrero, Tamaulipas, and they're the ones that

39:30.829 --> 39:42.961
settled this area. And including Nuevo Laredo, 
too, for that matter. Mm-hmm. And this is probably

39:46.527 --> 39:49.391
the reason why. If the greater number of the people 
here, you will find that one way or another they're

39:50.032 --> 39:54.959
related. Or there's some kind of tying in, 
probably possibly even by marriage. But at least

40:00.668 --> 40:06.256
there's something that makes a connection 
somewhere. Wasn't Bruni's wife from one of the

40:06.696 --> 40:09.220
Spanish families? Yes, ma'am, she was. She 
married a local woman. local woman here, and who

40:14.270 --> 40:18.535
was very well respected. That is correct. That's 
right. And that was true of Martine? That was true

40:23.141 --> 40:33.614
of Martine, or Martin as they now referred to, who 
the present mayor, Mayor J.C. Martin, is one of the

40:23.141 --> 40:33.614
descendants. But all of these people, and by the 
way, Mayor J.C. Martin was also, is also a grandson

40:33.634 --> 40:43.787
of A.M.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.659
Again, we come back again to the same families. A 
lot of intermarriage. Quite a bit. What about the

40:50.042 --> 40:51.143
new people?

40:54.986 --> 40:57.229
They are very well accepted here in Laredo. And 
many people have mentioned this, that Laredo

40:58.970 --> 41:09.100
opens up quite well to the people that move from out 
of town, which I think is the case. And we are just

41:10.261 --> 41:13.825
quite friendly. That's a feeling, that to a point, 
the greater number of the people, they really get

41:14.159 --> 41:28.300
to love the town here, because within a relatively 
short period of time, they get to know most

41:14.159 --> 41:28.300
everybody. And they are greeted on a very friendly 
basis. Well, did your father ever talk about his

41:32.847 --> 41:36.072
move to Laredo? Did he ever wish he could move back 
to San Ignacio? No. On the contrary, he said that

41:40.919 --> 41:42.782
that was the best blessing that he ever did in 
moving down here to Laredo. Because he never sold

41:48.030 --> 41:51.256
his properties in Zapata. He kept them. And he kept 
on farming. He had some agriculture out there. It

41:58.848 --> 41:59.910
was dry farming. But he kept on working the land out 
there. At the same time, he was able to improve his

42:03.745 --> 42:13.900
financial situation by moving down here to 
Loreto. So he definitely was, I would say,

42:13.920 --> 42:22.012
grateful in the sense that he decided to move down. 
And he made a good decision. That's the way he felt.

42:26.671 --> 42:32.038
That's the way he felt, because he was able to 
acquire a few pieces of property here. He didn't

42:32.599 --> 42:35.042
feel like it was too big a town or anything? No, not 
at all. Maybe because of the small-town

42:36.724 --> 42:38.787
atmosphere? No, no, because, like I say, he knew 
most everybody, and most everybody knew him. He

42:46.618 --> 42:52.105
was quite well-respected in Laredo. Well, you've 
talked about his basic honesty. Do you have any

42:56.796 --> 43:01.244
more, oh, the lots in Zapata? When old Zapata was 
moved, you said that he could have acquired more

43:02.045 --> 43:07.414
land than he did. Well, in the old town of Zapata, he 
had some very, very choice lots. Some of them that

43:14.987 --> 43:19.915
were right in the heart of the downtown, you might 
say, Zapata. And by the fact that he worked with the

43:20.738 --> 43:39.400
International Boundary Water Commission, he 
very well could have acquired, along the same

43:20.738 --> 43:39.400
lines, choice properties that surrounded the 
courthouse, that were right by the highway. But

43:39.420 --> 43:46.628
yet he decided that he was only going to ask for one 
lot and get the proper remuneration for those lots

43:47.300 --> 43:56.500
for the rest to the laws that he had so he definitely 
did not or was not the time to take advantage and

43:57.492 --> 44:18.471
this is a basic honesty that he had because that's 
the way he believed in now when land was or when the

43:57.492 --> 44:18.471
lots were given in replacement were people given 
lots that corresponded to the same position next

43:57.492 --> 44:18.471
to the square as their lots in the old town that this 
was the their intent whose idea was this do you know

44:18.620 --> 44:20.864
To a great extent, he was influential there. He 
was? Yes, ma'am. Well, I'm very glad. How did he

44:24.191 --> 44:28.920
happen to have this idea? Well, he felt that

44:29.321 --> 44:40.763
you must keep in mind that the old settlements were 
normally built around the courthouse and the

44:41.300 --> 44:43.002
square. And the closer you were, naturally, that 
was a kind of respect again that you had. It was a

44:48.288 --> 44:54.696
matter of prestige where you lived in relation to 
the square, which is very old Spanish and Mexican.

44:54.716 --> 44:55.077
Very much so. Yes. And this is the same influence 
that he had as far as trying to do the same thing in

44:55.697 --> 45:04.568
moving to the new town of Zapata. And the 
relationship or the distance of these lots was how

45:05.289 --> 45:11.256
far you are from the courthouse. And you will 
notice that that's the case over there in the new

45:11.725 --> 45:15.222
town of Zapata. Well, I just wondered if the 
government might have had other plans if he hadn't

45:15.860 --> 45:20.187
suggested it. Well, that was a possibility. 
Because some of the records indicate that people

45:23.412 --> 45:34.570
in Old Zapata said they would move, they would 
exchange their lot if they could have a lot that was

45:23.412 --> 45:34.570
in the same relationship to the square. And he must 
have passed this information on and convinced

45:34.590 --> 45:40.940
people how important this was. Oh, very important 
to them. It was most important. Do you happen to

45:44.243 --> 45:47.787
know if this was done in New Guerrero? I'm afraid I 
don't. I don't have any idea how they worked it out

45:50.550 --> 45:53.754
in New Guerrero. I do know that people are still 
living in Old Guerrero that never moved to New

45:54.134 --> 45:59.701
Guerrero. With the flood water? I mean, with the 
dam and the lake water? Well, they live in the

46:02.504 --> 46:10.133
higher area of Old Guerrero, and it would be an 
interesting tour if you should ever have the time,

46:10.619 --> 46:26.704
because you still see the cobblestone roads 
there, and you still see many of the old...
