Yeah. Yeah. Is

02:44.360 --> 02:54.644
that soft on the belly for me? You know, they're 
trying to pass the time. Like here at the park, they

02:55.526 --> 02:56.749
have to wait for the bus to come. Thank

don't know.

06:29.489 --> 06:53.532
It

06:29.489 --> 06:53.532
doesn't have to be different colors. You can have

you.

07:13.600 --> 07:35.013
We

07:13.600 --> 07:35.013
were talking about the number of times we were able 
to see a parent working for them. And a lot of times,

07:35.033 --> 07:35.974
it was a lot more positive. It was a lot more 
on-going. It was more, you know, I don't know. But

07:37.296 --> 07:37.957
for us, it kind of went down. It was a hundred years, 
right? .

08:04.357 --> 08:04.377
. . . . . . . Thank

08:05.035 --> 08:34.130

08:51.357 --> 09:07.864
Thank

08:51.357 --> 09:07.864
you. You

09:08.755 --> 09:36.423
know,

09:08.755 --> 09:36.423
you can't do anything about it. You know, you can't 
do anything about it. You know, you can't do

09:37.284 --> 09:38.104
anything about it. You can't do anything about it. 
I'm

09:38.725 --> 10:03.741
trying to figure out what the problem is. I'm 
trying to figure out what the problem is. I'm

10:04.682 --> 10:05.584
trying to figure out what the problem is. I'm 
trying to figure out what the problem is. So

10:06.822 --> 10:30.204
that kept us in the community,

10:06.822 --> 10:30.204
and we grew our corn, and then we had tickets for the 
mail, and then we went to the corn fields. And we

10:30.224 --> 10:30.924
grew up really, really nice. I don't know if you 
want me to show it, but we had a farm. We had a big

10:32.126 --> 10:33.707
farm, and we had a lot of expenses, but we didn't 
have to do that. And

10:33.687 --> 10:57.337
then there's a picture of it. And you can't really 
know where it's going to go. So it was, you know,

10:58.359 --> 10:58.980
something. And I'm the biggest, you know. And 
there's a picture of it. And then there's a picture

11:00.201 --> 11:00.862
of it. And that's it. And then there's a picture of 
it. And then there's a picture of it. And then

11:02.544 --> 11:03.205
there's a picture of it. Thank

11:05.193 --> 11:12.925
you. Thank

11:13.411 --> 11:38.068
you. .

12:07.770 --> 12:07.790
. . . .

12:24.269 --> 12:44.220
and

12:24.269 --> 12:44.220
it takes a little bit more time. You know, 
sometimes it takes a little bit of time to go away,

12:44.240 --> 12:46.303
and I think it's kind of crazy sometimes. You know, 
sometimes it takes a little bit more time to go

12:46.323 --> 12:48.426
away, and I think it's kind of crazy sometimes. You 
know, sometimes it takes a little bit more time to

12:48.446 --> 12:50.550
go away, and I think it's kind of crazy sometimes. 
You know, sometimes it takes a little bit more time

12:50.570 --> 12:52.673
to go away, and I think it's kind of crazy 
sometimes. .

13:10.315 --> 13:10.335

you.

14:22.698 --> 14:41.078
Thank

14:22.698 --> 14:41.078
you. Then

14:41.429 --> 15:00.265
we know that the person has to be married, and then 
we have a building, and then we have a place to live,

14:41.429 --> 15:00.265
and then we have a place to live, and then we have a 
place to live. It's

15:01.072 --> 15:24.065
been a long time since we saw each other. It's been a 
long time since we saw each other. It's been a long

15:25.027 --> 15:25.948
time since we saw each other. We

want to thank you again for your help. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

15:40.627 --> 16:01.470
you. The

16:02.902 --> 16:26.988
rest of them have been dead for many years, but I 
believe they've passed away. The difference,

16:27.008 --> 16:27.689
they have changed. Now, the surroundings, 
they're everywhere. It's a terrible place. And

16:30.509 --> 16:56.770
I never felt that regret in my life. .

17:18.770 --> 17:18.790
. . . . It's

17:21.387 --> 17:43.412
on that same block on the other side. Man.

you. Thank

19:40.437 --> 20:01.568

20:05.750 --> 20:34.471
Well,

20:05.750 --> 20:34.471
I'm going to make it. I'm going to make it. I'm going 
to make it. I

20:35.534 --> 20:57.723
don't know. I don't know if they told us that. You 
know, it's very interesting. Not too many of them.

20:59.546 --> 20:59.966
Not too many of them. In fact, I don't think there's 
a lot. I don't know. I don't know. Thank

21:01.268 --> 21:18.180
you. I

21:20.405 --> 21:49.467
don't know. Thank

21:50.003 --> 22:13.260

23:52.870 --> 24:16.528
.

24:16.548 --> 24:16.568
. . . . . . And

24:19.600 --> 24:42.187
all those girls would be there, and we'd be yelling 
and cheering, and all that sort of thing. And

24:42.207 --> 24:42.908
that's what I was trying to do. I didn't know what I 
was going to do. I was laying down. I'd chill down,

24:44.069 --> 24:44.730
and I'd sit down. Thank

24:46.415 --> 25:09.231
you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

Yeah. Yeah.

Thank

29:11.386 --> 29:32.905
you. And

29:33.155 --> 29:56.277
then all the babies are going to be scared, and 
they're going to be talking about it to their

29:33.155 --> 29:56.277
parents, and they're going to be like, come 
around, and they're going to be like, come around,
