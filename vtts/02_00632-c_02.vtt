WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:04.991
I can think of some regions that live under the 
ocean. I think a great place for nightclubs, for

00:05.011 --> 00:07.133
instance. I can think of great nightclubs. 
There's a beautiful one in the Gulf of Eilat that

00:08.915 --> 00:12.859
the Israelis have. And you sit down there 
underneath, looking up through glass windows and

00:12.879 --> 00:20.768
everything going on in that beautiful part of the 
branch of the Red Sea. I can think of condominiums

00:23.070 --> 00:30.898
for people with emphysema

00:23.070 --> 00:30.898
living under one atmosphere, extra pressure. two 
atmospheres of pressure, they could live

00:31.756 --> 00:37.402
perfectly normal lives, couldn't they? That's 
all they need. Why should people go around gasping

00:38.984 --> 00:45.531
for breath in the last 10 years of their life when 
they could live under one extra atmosphere and

00:38.984 --> 00:45.531
breathe normally?

00:48.795 --> 01:00.328
And this might be a reasonable sort of location for 
a condominium under a couple of atmospheres of

00:48.795 --> 01:00.328
pressure down some beautiful parts of Florida 
Straits.

01:01.895 --> 01:10.786
And it makes it much easier to build and less 
dangerous if it's under water, where the pressure

01:01.895 --> 01:10.786
is equalized on the inside and outside. But as far 
as people just inhabiting the bottom of the ocean

01:10.806 --> 01:20.658
for reasons of space, I'd rather consider taking 
Jupiter apart and making some more planets. I

01:20.678 --> 01:21.800
think that's more feasible.

01:24.984 --> 01:27.587
That's a big engineering job. You can make dozens 
and dozens of planets.

01:37.366 --> 01:39.409
I'd like to be around for that one, by the way. Well, 
maybe you don't want to do that. Maybe you want to do

01:40.730 --> 01:45.656
is just add a little bit to Mars from Jupiter, you 
see, to make it more habitable.

01:48.500 --> 01:58.772
It's a real chemical engineering job, too, 
changing that ammonia into something else and

01:48.500 --> 01:58.772
getting water and so on, getting a decent 
atmosphere. Were you surprised, by the way, with

02:02.797 --> 02:09.145
reports coming back from Mars in terms of the 
satellite pictures or the landing pictures we're

02:02.797 --> 02:09.145
receiving now? I've been in Baja, California. 
I've been looking at Martian landscape for quite a

02:10.546 --> 02:13.069
while down there. But what are these like? They're 
boulder-strewn, aren't they? They're

02:15.873 --> 02:19.417
boulder-strewn, and the possibility that many of 
them are cut by water. Oh, yeah, sure. Well,

02:21.239 --> 02:27.647
obviously Mars has its ice caps of some sort. It has 
water or some condensable fluid. That's some

02:30.530 --> 02:32.753
condensable gas. And it certainly probably had 
more in the past. No, I don't think I was

02:39.476 --> 02:42.619
particularly surprised. Not that I was believing 
the canals of Mars, but

02:42.639 --> 02:53.493
I think it's perfectly real. What I was really 
surprised on at was the surface of Venus. I mean, it

02:59.699 --> 03:14.761
really didn't occur to me, or I guess anybody else, 
that with such a dense atmosphere as Venus, and

02:59.699 --> 03:14.761
even with such tremendously high wind 
velocities, that the boundary layer should be so

02:59.699 --> 03:14.761
thick that there was no wind at the surface, 
essentially windless at the surface. I think that

03:14.781 --> 03:22.753
was strange.

03:22.773 --> 03:25.217
All right. I wanted to ask you two or three 
questions about aquaculture. Do you see the

03:30.361 --> 03:44.420
future in aquaculture and such things as planned 
oyster beds, or do you see it in terms of mining what

03:30.361 --> 03:44.420
we always classified before as seaweeds, or both?

03:45.942 --> 03:50.108
Well, you know, we start out with I'm thinking 
we've just thought of agriculture. Of course,

03:54.333 --> 03:59.779
every place in the world, other than the United 
States, has conducted it for a long time.

04:00.139 --> 04:03.382
Japanese, there's tremendous industries all 
through Indonesia. Almost everybody in the world

04:05.364 --> 04:08.007
knows more about agriculture than we do. We start 
out as though, now we're going to solve all these

04:08.728 --> 04:12.692
problems. I was looking at East Pakistan, and East 
Pakistan produces in its ponds. Now, this is

04:18.498 --> 04:19.479
freshwater. Ponds and bills. And about as much 
fish, that little country produced about as much

04:21.728 --> 04:34.712
fish as a third of the US catch, just from its ponds 
and bill. Oh, it's essentially culture. Well,

04:37.726 --> 04:40.830
hell, everybody knows more about this than we do. 
And so I'm not quite sure what you mean. Why don't

04:43.734 --> 04:45.116
you ask me about a future of it? If you ask me, is the 
United States going to learn from anybody, I'm not

04:45.737 --> 04:49.401
so sure. They're going to go through all the 
difficulties of trying to solve the problems all

04:49.421 --> 04:53.186
by themselves. They're going to make it so 
expensive that the only thing that can possibly be

04:53.627 --> 05:04.341
used is high luxury food that has nothing to do 
about the impact of protein food on the world's

04:53.627 --> 05:04.341
supply, as far as I can see. Now, it does seem to me 
that we're trying to jump, if you look at, you're an

05:04.844 --> 05:24.979
agricultural historian, and I may be quite wrong 
about this history, but it seems to me like there's

05:04.844 --> 05:24.979
a sequential series from the hunting economy to 
the gathering economy to what I would call the

05:04.844 --> 05:24.979
ranch economy. where you use preferred 
herbivores to crop the land with their own energy,

05:25.702 --> 05:45.294
to the farm in which you start to raise the supplies 
for your domestic animals, to the battery culture

05:25.702 --> 05:45.294
in which you bring food in to immobilized or 
essentially immobilized creatures from

05:25.702 --> 05:45.294
whatever worldwide sources are necessary. Now, 
we're immediately leaping to that last step, the

05:45.354 --> 05:50.562
battery culture. But ocean is a poor environment. 
It's a thin broth that has trace. The food is highly

05:58.515 --> 06:00.880
dispersed in a dense medium. It's a million times 
more dilute than, say, a grass field, a field of

06:02.103 --> 06:06.793
grass. A million times more

06:06.813 --> 06:10.761
dilute. Traditionally, and even today, in modern 
society, where you have a poor environment, you

06:11.838 --> 06:17.928
use ranging techniques. You send your preferred 
creature out onto this. You don't use diesel oil.

06:22.395 --> 06:27.643
You do a little bit of diesel oil to cultivate or 
gather food and bring it into them. You let them

06:27.663 --> 06:35.736
burn some part of the crop that's sparsely 
distributed out here, and then you have a roundup.

06:36.003 --> 06:40.549
You bring them back in some way, and you have made 
some net gain. Well, the one interesting thing you

06:41.550 --> 06:49.701
have in the ocean is this number of species that 
will round themselves up, all the anadromous

06:41.550 --> 06:49.701
fishes, the ones that come in and spawn. And some of 
these are primitive feeders, some of the shads.

06:55.730 --> 07:02.481
The hilsa, the Indian shad, is a particularly fine 
food fish. So it seems to me like a sensible step

07:02.501 --> 07:05.826
would really be ranging. That is, you culture a 
population which you now turn loose in its thin

07:05.906 --> 07:13.839
environment to graze it and then to return to you, 
you see. And you can do some predator control and

07:14.780 --> 07:22.092
maybe some seeding of sorts, just essentially the 
way you do it in rangeland management.

07:22.493 --> 07:24.094
essentially the same sort of level. But our effort 
here is to or leap all of these steps that we've

07:24.655 --> 07:34.884
taken 3,000 years to go through on land and go right 
to battery culture. Well, I don't know. The

07:36.125 --> 07:45.493
problems, obviously, of animal husbandry, once 
you get to these more concentrated levels, has

07:36.125 --> 07:45.493
totally been a disease. And we have spent a 
tremendous lot of time. This is a disease of any

07:48.696 --> 07:51.218
concentration of organisms. And we spent a lot of 
time solving this in the case of our preferred

07:52.345 --> 07:58.372
species on land. Each one of these organisms in the 
ocean is going to have a series of disasters. We try

08:05.820 --> 08:06.981
battery culture. Exactly the same nature. One new 
disease after another.

08:15.551 --> 08:18.254
And all the immunization, all the research that 
has to go behind it. But in the United States, I

08:18.934 --> 08:22.318
don't think we'll progress beyond luxury food. 
Because it's not necessary for us to increase the

08:24.188 --> 08:27.332
protein supply that much? Well, I think the 
increased protein supply around the world, and

08:29.634 --> 08:35.521
Ravel may have talked to you about this, is 
something of a delusion anyway. But actually, the

08:36.062 --> 08:45.793
world is equally short on fats and oils, probably 
more limiting nutrients. But no, because we'll

08:45.813 --> 08:52.761
make things too expensive.

08:53.281 --> 09:04.362
Every time we build a lobster industry, we'll have 
to build a sewage disposal plant just to get rid of

08:53.281 --> 09:04.362
the seawater that it went through, and so on, that 
went through that lobster culture, and so forth.

09:04.562 --> 09:10.293
And just the manpower involved in things is going 
to make it impossible to culture anything except

09:04.562 --> 09:10.293
luxury species. I think we'll find out some 
interesting things. OK. Now. But the ranging of

09:17.176 --> 09:30.589
using some sort of primitive feeder like shad to go 
forth into the ocean and concentrate this thin

09:17.176 --> 09:30.589
soup of the ocean and bring it back to us, now that 
seems to be a much more viable approach. But you

09:30.609 --> 09:31.712
don't think we'll choose? I don't think we'll 
choose, no.

09:47.467 --> 09:54.015
I want you to describe how fish population 
histories can be inferred from fish scales found

09:47.467 --> 09:54.015
in sediments. I wasn't sure I understood that. And 
what ecological and evolutionary implications

09:57.519 --> 10:03.826
does this technique have? Well, it's somewhat 
unlimited, I think, eventually. But let me

10:06.690 --> 10:09.193
describe the technique to start with. In a few 
places, the ocean bottom is continuously

10:09.693 --> 10:17.102
building up, as you know, and continuously moving 
and doing all these things that we began to

10:17.572 --> 10:24.782
understand from seafloor spreading and 
continental drift. But in a few places around the

10:24.802 --> 10:36.619
world, the bottom waters, usually in near shore 
basins, are anaerobic or anoxic. They have no

10:36.639 --> 10:39.783
oxygen in them, and nothing lives there. Even 
though over most of the ocean, the sediments are

10:40.023 --> 10:46.212
raining down every year. There are things living 
there that mix them up, and so the time resolution

10:46.900 --> 10:53.951
that you can get is of the order of 10,000 years at 
the best. The sediments are mixed continuously.

10:58.818 --> 11:03.004
But in these regions, they're laid down in layers 
that you can identify year by year. You can put your

11:03.825 --> 11:09.033
finger on it and say, within a few years, that year 
is the year zero right there. That's what the

11:09.093 --> 11:12.418
sediments were laid down in the year zero. you go 
back in time become somewhat less certain but you

11:14.322 --> 11:41.865
can just count back and you can check your count 
with radioactive dating well such sediments

11:14.322 --> 11:41.865
exist on land the whole monterey formation and you 
can split it open and you can see peppered with fish

11:14.322 --> 11:41.865
scales and other kinds of debris diatoms form and 
effort so you know something in that year of what

11:14.322 --> 11:41.865
the pacific was doing or what the ocean was doing 
and something about what fish were present, you

11:42.470 --> 11:49.438
see, because you can identify these scales. You 
can date these scales, and you can tell how old they

11:49.938 --> 11:58.628
were and how fast they were growing, how, you know, 
what species it was, you know, how old the fish was

11:49.938 --> 11:58.628
and how fast it had grown. So you know a great deal, 
and you know it for that year, exactly. Well, the

12:04.174 --> 12:11.262
kind of Rosetta Stone in this whole business is, of 
course, if you try this, how well does this agree to

12:04.174 --> 12:11.262
the known history? And when we went through that 
exercise, we found it agreed very well with the

12:12.794 --> 12:22.265
known history, where we really know what the 
populations of the pelagic fish are out here. Our

12:22.305 --> 12:40.287
results from looking at these sediments and 
analyzing the number of scales per year coming

12:22.305 --> 12:40.287
down, totally independently, gives us the same 
curve of the variation between the number of hake,

12:22.305 --> 12:40.287
the number of anchovies, the number of saris, and 
the number of sardines. This gives us confidence

12:41.178 --> 12:49.168
we can make these same kind of counts back into the 
past, as far as we want, and see what has been the

12:41.178 --> 12:49.168
relationship between these fish. And what we find 
is something very surprising. We find that the

12:53.794 --> 13:10.375
sardine, which was the dominant phlegic fish here 
when man first started his fisheries, has never

12:53.794 --> 13:10.375
been here for long periods of time, but only for 
short bursts, maybe eight times in the last 1,600

12:53.794 --> 13:10.375
years has it been here in quantity. The anchovy 
harbor has been here continuously over the whole

13:11.300 --> 13:16.968
time, you see. So it's really quite an interesting 
picture. And my earlier parts of my conversation,

13:20.553 --> 13:27.923
when I said society would seem to be unable to act on 
information, this is very powerful information.

13:27.963 --> 13:40.260
You would really never have expected to have such a 
real insight into the way these species

13:27.963 --> 13:40.260
interacted in the past and what their natural 
abundance was and how it fluctuated. And now to

13:41.118 --> 14:01.152
conceive that a fishery on the Anchovy, a species 
that has maintained a sizable population here for

13:41.118 --> 14:01.152
at least the last 1600 years, would be the same as a 
fishery on the sardine, a species that was never

13:41.118 --> 14:01.152
able to maintain a sizable population here for 
more than 40 or 50 or 80 years at a time. and then only

14:01.908 --> 14:06.052
a few periods, is asinine. I mean, you couldn't 
expect it to have the same result, fishery on a

14:06.112 --> 14:12.179
transient species and fishery on a permanent 
species.

14:15.582 --> 14:25.873
So in my earlier remarks, I said I thought we had 
gotten exquisite answers on some of these

14:15.582 --> 14:25.873
problems that society had enunciated as a 
worthwhile problem to work on. And yet the

14:27.305 --> 14:35.720
disappointment is, of course, not that they don't 
act on this, but they don't consider it even in

14:27.305 --> 14:35.720
their actions, to reiterate. OK.

14:36.321 --> 14:42.111
What about in terms of evolutionary 
implications? Do you foresee being able to apply

14:46.542 --> 14:50.707
to see the evolution in general of fishes and fish 
species from this kind of? Well, of course, that's

14:50.727 --> 14:57.515
the traditional way of going because their 10,000 
year resolution has no particular consequence.

14:58.557 --> 15:04.424
But to see the interrelationships between the 
microorganisms, for instance. So we know how the

15:04.444 --> 15:07.808
Pacific was behaving when the sardine was here. 
and how it behaved when they changed from one

15:09.104 --> 15:11.808
species to another. We'll eventually know what 
environmental conditions mediated these shifts

15:11.848 --> 15:30.156
between species, because we can see how much 
mid-Pacific influence there was, how strong the

15:11.848 --> 15:30.156
California current was, how much subtropical 
water was flowing up, how strong was the

15:11.848 --> 15:30.156
countercurrent. And do this on a year-by-year 
basis. That's a huge job. We have to identify all

15:34.170 --> 15:44.062
the diatoms and foraminifera in these little thin 
layers, seven tenths of a millimeter thick. But

15:44.082 --> 16:01.183
you see, if we now go to a place like the

15:44.082 --> 16:01.183
Bay of Bengal, and the Indians are going to start a 
fishery, say, on their astrology, wouldn't it be a

15:44.082 --> 16:01.183
wonderful thing to be able to tell them, is that a 
permanent thing? species here? Is it

16:02.795 --> 16:05.199
occasionally replaced by others? Is it just a 
transient species? How steady is the population?

16:08.504 --> 16:10.346
How steady has it been for 2,000 years? These are 
big answers for people who want to guide their

16:11.127 --> 16:14.753
fisheries in some rational way.

16:27.572 --> 16:30.917
Would you judge us to be proceeding cautiously 
enough are not cautiously enough in developing

16:31.167 --> 16:35.191
the sea. What do you mean by us? Well, us as 
Americans. Would you encourage us to exercise

16:38.814 --> 16:43.118
more caution or less caution? I think caution is 
the wrong word there. I would advise us to use more

16:45.961 --> 16:48.883
rationality. Caution is really totally the wrong 
word.

16:58.072 --> 17:00.634
For example, we're going to The whole matter of 
domestic waste is floating in the ocean. What do

17:05.634 --> 17:07.115
you want to call caution there? Caution is putting 
out a billion dollars in Los Angeles to build

17:09.077 --> 17:14.322
tertiary treatment plants, is it? $300 per, $500 
per capita when we have so many social needs? Is

17:25.273 --> 17:26.093
that caution? No, all the evidence is the ocean is 
perfectly competent to absorb these kind of

17:26.854 --> 17:30.698
wastes. That's its business. Absorbing organic 
material. So I'm not quite sure what the cost is.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.218
Rationality is the word. Yes. We need a great deal 
more. A great deal more. We need people other than

17:43.685 --> 17:48.871
Cousteau advising the government on what to do. He 
has reasons to scare people to death.

17:55.359 --> 17:55.800
Which are? Funds for his institution. It's going 
to be extremely costly. to society as a whole. It

18:05.828 --> 18:07.489
doesn't take a balanced viewpoint. There's 
pictures of us climbing to the highest mountain

18:07.529 --> 18:19.220
tops and clutching our throats because we're 
dying of anoxia because we've killed all the

18:07.529 --> 18:19.220
phytoplankton. No evidence. No evidence. Now, 
what do you see your role in the future of

18:23.064 --> 18:25.746
oceanography? How do you perceive yourself in the 
coming future? Well, I'd like to know. I have no

18:31.171 --> 18:32.232
idea. I've always been enthusiastic

18:33.494 --> 18:44.807
and melioristic, I guess is the word. Somewhere 
between optimistic and pessimistic. I think

18:48.611 --> 18:53.977
melioristic is optimism, but only you have to do 
something about it and just have it happen. I've,

18:56.220 --> 19:01.746
to some real degree, right at the moment, lost 
confidence that Defense can be influenced very

19:02.030 --> 19:09.460
promptly.

19:09.480 --> 19:20.055
But our political system is such that it really is 
not able to respond to the evidence.

19:20.075 --> 19:25.742
It's acclimation, government by acclimation of 
some sort. A politician moves the beat. causes the

19:29.435 --> 19:36.065
least stir in some way, gets the fewest people mad 
at him. And I really think maybe we just can't act

19:37.447 --> 19:39.951
this way. Now, maybe we can afford not to act this 
way. We can afford to put an extra billion dollars

19:42.655 --> 19:50.987
in sewer plants in every major city along the coast 
for no purpose.

19:52.030 --> 19:52.992
And maybe we need to. Maybe it's the WPA of sorts. 
Maybe it's the science that we've worked on as a WPA

19:54.655 --> 19:58.481
of sorts at a higher level. Maybe the WPA concept 
has evolved so that I'm nothing but a WPA worker

19:58.541 --> 20:10.061
making bridges in some unknown creek in some 
unknown mountain that will never be seen again. I

20:10.081 --> 20:16.452
dislike thinking this, but I'm beginning to 
wonder if the WPA concept hasn't spread quite a

20:16.786 --> 20:21.271
bit. It worries me to see this wake of scientists 
who have tried to serve this country and unable to

20:22.193 --> 20:34.628
serve it. A great number of people that worked on 
desalination just announced today that

20:34.648 --> 20:45.561
something you knew 20 years ago when the 
desalination program on the OSW was established.

20:45.895 --> 20:49.378
that it was impossible to do this for agricultural 
water. And you could make that calculation in an

20:49.779 --> 20:51.921
instant. At that time, you knew that if the ocean 
were freshwater, that is, if it were given to you at

20:53.862 --> 21:03.191
sea level, it would have very little effect on our 
utilization of water in these United States. It's

21:03.491 --> 21:04.512
too big a continent.

21:08.055 --> 21:12.760
But

21:08.055 --> 21:12.760
I'm not a bit sure. I came to the conclusion that 
Israel was full of smart people. They had reason to

21:19.157 --> 21:22.021
be conservative with their resources. They're 
screwed up as we are. They've brought our culture

21:23.884 --> 21:25.626
there anyway. They are a piece of the United 
States, more or less. They have the same screw-up

21:27.890 --> 21:29.792
as we have. So I'm not quite sure. Mexico? Mexico 
looks pretty good, I think. They don't

21:35.561 --> 21:38.565
necessarily follow the tradition. They can have 
their microondas instead of stringing copper

21:39.338 --> 21:46.686
wires around forever because Anaconda insists on 
it or whatever. They can have their communication

21:46.746 --> 21:55.455
system by some totally modern approach rather 
than by the conventional ones. Can they conduct a

21:56.056 --> 21:57.477
fishery that way? Yes. These are the countries 
that are going to maybe profit from this research.

22:02.903 --> 22:04.705
They're starting an anchovy fishery. And they're 
going to start it on the basis of the data we got to

22:05.258 --> 22:09.582
try to help the people of California. Well,

22:10.183 --> 22:15.188
survival is the fittest. I think the same old laws 
still act. Are you still intimately involved, by

22:20.173 --> 22:22.555
the way, with Israel? I don't know what you mean, 
intimately. We're putting a breakwater over

22:25.138 --> 22:26.479
there. Yeah, I mean, is that process still going 
on? Oh, sure. Okay. Yeah. Sure, they're bright

22:31.651 --> 22:35.256
people, but they're screwed up also. They have 
their own political system that's copied much

22:35.716 --> 22:40.583
after ours. They also can't do the rational thing.

22:47.212 --> 22:52.358
What role do you see for Scripps' institution in 
the future of oceanography? Oh, well, I think

22:53.059 --> 22:57.405
Scripps will be a leader for a long time. He'll be a 
leader for the simple reason that there are a lot of

22:57.445 --> 23:01.050
bright people here. foreseeable future, I think 
that it has to avoid getting into huge projects

23:02.566 --> 23:11.720
which totally dominate it in many ways. Say, for 
instance, the CERI project. It certainly may have

23:15.105 --> 23:17.348
a role in that. But I think it's unhealthy for very 
large projects to dominate an institution like

23:17.448 --> 23:29.907
that, unless they're very highly generalized 
ones. I think it should have a better role somehow

23:31.017 --> 23:36.384
in advising the government. I've been looking at a 
series of reports lately

23:36.404 --> 23:44.233
in which we really act. I collect together various 
groups of scientists as rather fixed panels to

23:45.315 --> 23:56.749
review various research projects, various 
proposals, and really criticize them. And I think

23:56.769 --> 24:00.433
that's having a salutary I think that's working 
rather well, but it's a rather small scale. I think

24:06.245 --> 24:09.029
maybe that's the way one might act. Really get 
competent people together so when Lockheed or API

24:09.049 --> 24:24.531
or somebody like that has a big project, there's a 
competent review by competent scientists that

24:09.049 --> 24:24.531
are undertaken to really see if it makes sense, so 
that you don't get in this funny situation of

24:25.186 --> 24:38.121
they're still dealing with small-scale 
hydrodynamics when it's really very large-scale

24:25.186 --> 24:38.121
hydrodynamics.

24:38.141 --> 24:46.650
Do you think that the role of oceanography, or 
restructuring oceanography, if I may use that

24:38.141 --> 24:46.650
word, or development of the oceans... Is 
explosive.

24:50.795 --> 24:50.895
Sure. I think that... It still suffers, like most 
research in the United States, from the final and

24:53.789 --> 25:06.241
enveloping shock wave of Alamogordo, which is, if 
you throw enough money at it, you can solve it. That

25:09.043 --> 25:12.447
was foreseeable, wasn't it? You put a billion 
dollars in, you released this vast amount of

25:12.467 --> 25:17.311
energy. But somehow, the important thing is I 
remember the days when I was peripherally

25:21.818 --> 25:28.764
associated with these great men who were 
responsible for nuclear energy. Karam, Gamow,

25:30.566 --> 25:33.588
Fermi, all these people. And I remember the 
excitement there was at that time. Here was really

25:36.090 --> 25:37.552
the new world. Columbus entering the new world. 
Many ideas. Nobody had the idea it was going to be

25:41.035 --> 25:48.822
just nuclear reactors in the conventional time. 
Today, there were all kinds. with ideas of how you

25:50.995 --> 25:55.660
use this nuclear energy, including plowshare, 
just as an explosive. We've kind of lost that sense

25:57.161 --> 25:58.803
of adventure. Everybody's treading too lightly. 
Somebody else is going to have to do it, French

26:01.045 --> 26:04.209
possibly. I don't know. They seem more 
adventurous right now. They have a different kind

26:07.092 --> 26:08.753
of a government, too. 40 people can argue about 
something rather than just on 40 sides, rather

26:08.773 --> 26:17.222
than 20 on two sides.

26:20.982 --> 26:40.969
All kinds of viewpoints can be raised in a 
Napoleonic society that can't be raised in a

26:20.982 --> 26:40.969
common law, English common law society, just 
because of the influence, I think, of our

26:20.982 --> 26:40.969
judiciary system.

26:40.989 --> 26:42.531
The influence of our judiciary system? Of our 
judiciary system, our advocative system. Oh, OK.

26:45.095 --> 26:48.880
All right. then you conceive... It's a curious 
output, as I understand it. You probably know much

26:52.987 --> 26:56.071
more about this, and your wife probably knows more 
than you do about it. But it seems to me that a result

26:57.193 --> 27:06.684
of the Napoleonic system is you try to get at the 
truth, not just... The gray area is considered.

27:09.027 --> 27:09.748
Pros and cons. It's a court of equity rather than a 
court of law, if I use these terms correctly. In the

27:15.556 --> 27:21.456
United States, all these things are decided as 
though they were a court of law, either right or

27:15.556 --> 27:21.456
wrong, one or the other. Science isn't that way.
