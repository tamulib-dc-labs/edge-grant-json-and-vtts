January 29th, 1981. This is Terry Anderson. This

00:07.201 --> 00:10.686
is a test. So this is an interview with Dr. 
Harrison, a graduate of the first class of

00:11.947 --> 00:20.579
veterinary medicine in 1920. Today is January 
29th, 1981. And I'd like to ask you first if we could

00:24.665 --> 00:30.713
start this interview by... you agreeing to donate 
the tape to texas a m university will you agree to

00:30.997 --> 01:00.936
that yeah yeah okay thank you thank you very much 
could you tell us about your early years let's

00:30.997 --> 01:00.936
start with uh where and when you were born i was born 
right in brown up here on the hill really yeah in a

00:30.997 --> 01:00.936
two-story house and uh i've gone and see

00:30.997 --> 01:00.936
uh I mean, you know, you get caught sometimes, you 
can't think of a thing. I know, I know, I know. Can

01:08.687 --> 01:10.028
you tell me about your parents? Well, both of them 
are dead. Yeah? My father's dead and my mother's

01:13.133 --> 01:15.195
dead. My mother died

01:15.255 --> 01:22.185
seven years after Papa died. And what did they do? 
They were medicine doctors. Oh, they were medical

01:25.629 --> 01:28.353
doctors, both your mother and your dad? No, no, no, 
no, no. She was a housekeeper. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. She

01:31.780 --> 01:37.712
was strictly a housekeeper, and she had seven 
children. No, five children. Five children. Five

01:40.597 --> 01:41.359
children. That's a pretty good-sized family. And 
your dad, your dad was a, your father was a medical.

01:46.449 --> 01:50.397
Well, he graduated at University of Vanderbilt. 
Oh, really? Vanderbilt. Okay. And was he just a

01:54.123 --> 01:56.988
general practitioner? Well, that's all they had 
here then. That's all they need now. It's good

02:01.055 --> 02:07.106
general practitioner fellows to go that when they 
call, they'll go. But they won't do that now. They

02:09.611 --> 02:13.077
want to meet them at the hospital. And you get them 
in the hospital, and of course, it's easy to

02:13.259 --> 02:22.574
diagnose a case in the hospital, tears it out at the 
home. But if you're well-practiced and

02:23.075 --> 02:39.681
well-versed, well, it doesn't make any 
difference, because outside of a blood test, you

02:23.075 --> 02:39.681
can tell pretty well what's going on with them. 
Okay, okay. Could you tell me about your early

02:41.339 --> 02:44.524
years growing up in Bryan? Well, yeah, I could do 
it. I went to high school right up here on the hill,

02:47.408 --> 02:50.733
right up here. But it is now the high school now. Let 
me see. Where is the high school? It's between here

02:55.519 --> 02:57.843
and college. Yeah. It's the high school now. And it 
was built. The architect was an A&M graduate. And a

03:07.477 --> 03:11.262
small fellow about your size. What were your 
favorite topics in high school, do you remember?

03:18.677 --> 03:19.638
Topics, what do you mean? Subjects. What did you 
like to study then? Oh, well,

03:22.723 --> 03:31.375
I wasn't interested in anything but athletics. 
You were interested in football. In football,

03:34.099 --> 03:35.842
yeah. And football and baseball and basketball. 
All three of those. And track, I ran track two. What

03:49.110 --> 03:50.592
type of races did you run? I ran the 200 and 440 and a 
mile.

04:01.145 --> 04:04.429
Why did you decide to go to Texas A&M? I went to Texas 
A&M strictly to play football. I always wanted to

04:12.464 --> 04:20.314
play football, and I always wanted to make a letter 
after A&M, and I did so. By determination. I was

04:23.057 --> 04:23.537
little. I didn't weigh 135 pounds, 135, 36 pounds. 
And that's all I weighed the whole time I was at A&M.

04:32.208 --> 04:34.270
That is small for a football player. But when I hit 
them, they knew they were hit. Did you get a

04:40.072 --> 04:41.774
scholarship? No, they didn't have any such thing 
as scholarships then. We went to school because we

04:49.083 --> 04:54.069
wanted to go and wanted to go there.

04:56.953 --> 04:58.915
We didn't know what scholarship was. And don't 
know what it is now. A lot of the boys at A&M College

05:01.859 --> 05:04.242
don't know what it is. But they find out when they 
get out. You were in the Corps of Cadets, of course,

05:08.472 --> 05:10.975
back then. Oh, yeah. I was Captain of the Sea 
Company and one of the honors that they had there at

05:11.596 --> 05:29.759
A&M in the Company C. Company C. I didn't have that 
until I went back to school my senior year. I went

05:30.721 --> 05:33.885
back as a freshman. What I mean by that, I went back 
without any designation at all. But I was not very

05:38.375 --> 05:59.215
long or two or three days before I was made a captain 
of Company C. And I went to the president and told

05:38.375 --> 05:59.215
him that I didn't, the man that they had at Company C 
was a friend of mine and I didn't feel like that. I

05:59.235 --> 06:01.057
said, take your job. But he said, well... What did 
the president say to that? Well, he said, well, you

06:04.981 --> 06:07.403
got it, didn't you? I said, I did, but I didn't ask 
for it. And he said, since you have it, well, then

06:11.908 --> 06:16.094
you're going to keep it. And I said, all right, sir. 
That's the way you feel about it. That's all I mean.

06:20.900 --> 06:21.682
I had to call. I said, now, you call all the seniors 
together and have them talk to them and tell them

06:22.222 --> 06:31.955
why I took that

06:22.222 --> 06:31.955
job. And he did. He called them and had it right 
after lunch. And I worked there 15 minutes. Bazell

06:40.425 --> 06:55.081
was the president

06:40.425 --> 06:55.081
of the school and

06:40.425 --> 06:55.081
he was from Navasola. And he was followed by a man 
from Navasola.

07:03.210 --> 07:04.251
What did you think of Bazell? Oh, I liked him very 
well. But Bill was a good man. He went from Texas, he

07:09.555 --> 07:17.547
was here about 11, 12 years, and then he went up to 
Oklahoma. He saw his, you know, when a man's at a

07:17.567 --> 07:24.197
place that's certainly time, it's time for him to 
move on. He ought to. What he does not, he ought to

07:26.240 --> 07:29.425
move on.

07:31.949 --> 07:36.115
And so I went around and saw him, talked to him. And 
he was tickled

07:36.871 --> 07:44.918
to death before I came by. They all called me Chick. 
I had a nickname and they followed me from here. Why

07:50.984 --> 07:52.445
did they call you Chick? Well, it's a long story. 
The main thing was that my father took my brother

07:55.648 --> 08:06.658
and I to Houston.

08:07.499 --> 08:12.886
Got there where we had breakfast, actually, 
because we left on a four o'clock train. And we went

08:14.248 --> 08:24.480
right across the street to the old batter's hotel 
and had dinner, had supper, or had breakfast. I get

08:24.500 --> 08:25.382
it after a while. And so

08:26.723 --> 08:33.171
they asked me what I wanted. I said, well, what I 
want is chicken. He said, they don't serve chicken

08:37.486 --> 08:41.692
for breakfast yet. I said, I can't have that. I 
said, you asked me what I wanted, and that's what I

08:43.254 --> 08:49.383
want.

08:49.883 --> 08:54.269
But I can't get it, so I'll take some mayonnaise. He 
said, it'll be fine. You got that, I know. And he

08:58.335 --> 09:01.540
said, yep, you got that. And so from then on, I was 
called Chick. Oh, really? And then on I was called

09:07.338 --> 09:11.183
to, my father went to school at A&M too. Yeah, he 
went there one year. And he graduated, he didn't

09:14.086 --> 09:24.099
graduate from that, but he graduated in medicine 
in 91.

09:25.781 --> 09:34.712
And he began practicing, he got married, and 
mother, she was,

09:25.781 --> 09:34.712
her first husband was a conductor. He was a 
conductor on a train. And he was killed by a

09:38.951 --> 09:40.753
Mexican. By a Mexican that got on a train, he told me 
he didn't have a ticket. And he said, well, if you

09:45.619 --> 09:48.123
don't have a ticket, you can't go. He said, I'm 
going. He said, no, you're not either. And so he

09:52.488 --> 09:55.853
just pulled out a gun and shot him and killed him. 
Well, that's terrible. And so I don't know what

09:57.775 --> 10:03.923
kind of make much difference or what. whether they 
did anything to the Michigan Nine, I guess they

10:05.118 --> 10:18.289
did, because they were looking for something, a 
good bed to sleep in, and three meals a day is what

10:05.118 --> 10:18.289
they were looking for. What about your interests 
besides sports at A&M? Were you particularly

10:24.555 --> 10:29.639
interested in any professors or any subjects? Oh, 
I got along with all of them. I got along with all of

10:32.321 --> 10:33.742
them. I knew them all. except the new ones that came 
in there. I can, you want the names of the

10:38.851 --> 10:42.796
professors? Well, if you remember them. Oh, I 
remember them. Oh, well, okay. One of them was a

10:47.601 --> 10:57.271
little Jew, and he was graduating, he taught from 
college. And so he, when

11:04.012 --> 11:05.214
We all finished. Four years. Eighteen was in the 
class. They started out and only four graduated.

11:14.065 --> 11:16.268
And they either dropped out or they quit or 
something. But anyhow, there were four. And those

11:21.716 --> 11:31.048
four were a fellow by the name of Murray and a fellow 
by the name of Murray and... Hall and Rosenberg.

11:31.315 --> 11:36.062
Roseburg and Hall and- Hall and Murray. Well, 
Fritz Murray was one of- Right. Yeah, four of them.

11:41.750 --> 11:42.471
Four graduates. And they all lived but me.

11:51.403 --> 12:00.276
Murray used to be at- was a- died at Taylor. Can you 
tell me about these classmates of yours? What kind

12:03.483 --> 12:04.684
of people they were? We don't have much 
information on them. We have their pictures, and

12:07.146 --> 12:09.308
that's about all. Well, Merle got that phone.

12:14.733 --> 12:21.960
Well, yeah, Merle, he was from, he was a foreigner. 
He came here to go to school.

12:26.305 --> 12:27.866
Was he from England or Germany? No, he wasn't from 
any place. He was from... What was he now?

12:38.426 --> 12:40.609
He was about 40 years old when he came there. Oh, 
really? I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. He talked

12:44.675 --> 12:52.066
funny and he used to take care of the children for 
the professors when they wanted to go out at night.

12:52.106 --> 12:55.211
They'd call them up and see if he was going to be busy 
that night. If he wasn't, well, they'd harm. And

12:57.314 --> 12:59.878
they would harm to stay there with the children and 
look after the children until 11 o'clock or 12

13:00.213 --> 13:05.300
o'clock when they came back.

13:09.146 --> 13:15.475
That's the way he did that all four years when he was 
a senior on now. What kind of person was Murray? He

13:18.259 --> 13:19.221
was a nice fella. He got along with everybody. Very 
nice fella. He would Oh, well, he was very nice. All

13:29.460 --> 13:37.732
I can say, I'm not much on describing a man, saying 
what a man can do. What about Joe Hall? Well, old

13:41.037 --> 13:44.643
Joe, he was from Carthage, Texas. He's dead. As I 
said, they're all dead now. And he was very good. I

13:53.516 --> 13:55.920
don't think he had a book while he was at A&M. He went 
to class and paid attention in class. And he was

14:00.562 --> 14:05.807
able to graduate without buying a book. Now he 
bought a book and used library one. I don't know

14:08.750 --> 14:09.430
which. But anyhow, he graduated. You thought he 
was very smart then? Oh yeah, he was smart. Joe was

14:16.997 --> 14:20.040
very smart. And he had a sister that was going to, 
while he was going to A&M, his sister was going to

14:20.060 --> 14:26.886
CIA.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.661
That's up above Dallas. And what about Rosenberg? 
Rosenberg was, he was, he was a

14:31.823 --> 14:44.355
father was, went broke during the Depression, the 
first Depression we had, you know. And he was a

14:44.375 --> 14:45.456
cotton buyer. He dealt in cotton and he lost all his 
money in the cotton. He bought cotton and bought

14:52.523 --> 14:54.985
futures. And, you know, you buy futures. Sure. 
They go down, well if you don't have money to pay

14:58.068 --> 15:03.456
them, they don't care a thing about it. They just 
sell it and get what they have in it. And so he sold,

15:08.623 --> 15:25.307
his father was a very prominent man in the place he 
lived. What kind of student was Rosenberg? He was a

15:28.677 --> 15:30.359
very good student. All four of them were very good

15:30.559 --> 15:35.766
students. They all graduated at A&M

15:35.786 --> 15:48.943
and

15:35.786 --> 15:48.943
I guess that's about all I can say about him. He was a 
very good student, all I can say. Being in the very

15:53.049 --> 15:55.632
first class of the vet school, Did you think that 
there were any special pressures on you or any

15:56.135 --> 16:08.793
special ideas about what veterinarians were 
supposed to be because you were the first class? Do

16:08.833 --> 16:12.198
you think that the professors treated you any 
differently? No, they didn't. They treated me

16:13.440 --> 16:19.268
just the same as everyone else. Why did you decide 
to go to vet school? because they didn't have any,

16:22.443 --> 16:34.618
that was before they had to, you know, classes set 
aside for medicine. And so I decided that since

16:35.258 --> 16:40.685
they didn't have any out there, I wanted to go to 
A&M. And since they didn't have any out there,

16:41.566 --> 16:52.399
well, I went ahead and took back medicine because 
it was the only thing that I knew that I could take

16:41.566 --> 16:52.399
that, that would help me in a few years. And it did 
help a whole lot. And then later on you decided to go

16:58.846 --> 17:01.550
to medical school. Four years later I decided to go 
to medical school. In between time I worked for the

17:04.114 --> 17:06.597
state. I was with the Livestock Sanitary 
Commission in the wheat building. It's torn down

17:11.464 --> 17:15.390
now and I haven't been back there since then. And 
what did you do? I went all over Texas. I had a

17:23.851 --> 17:33.224
regular pass, I'd buy the tickets myself, and buy a 
book of tickets. And when I, the state would

17:33.825 --> 17:38.191
furnish them. And I'd go out, I told the head, the 
state veterinarian to keep me out of the office all

17:39.674 --> 17:52.592
he could.

17:54.091 --> 18:21.786
I didn't want to, since I was on a salary and was 
being paid by the month, that I was, I could keep my

17:54.091 --> 18:21.786
money in the bank a lot easier than I could if I had it 
in my pocket. And so you traveled around Texas, and

18:22.829 --> 18:26.835
what did you do? I went out and was like a 
veterinarian. Went out and saw the animals, a

18:31.502 --> 18:34.707
bunch of them. I saw them and saw if they were dying 
from an infectious disease. Well, if I could get

18:41.197 --> 18:47.546
the vaccine, I'd get it and vaccinate the cattle 
for them. I see. The first job I had, I was... It was

18:52.394 --> 18:57.380
set down in the town, it was down in Brackettville. 
And I stayed there three months. And I slept in a

19:01.025 --> 19:05.411
courthouse and took a bath in a jail. Really? 
Because there wasn't any hotel? There was a hotel,

19:08.775 --> 19:16.845
a 32-story old building that a color woman had for a 
hotel, but that's about all. But they had a post

19:17.206 --> 19:18.667
there. And the Army had a post there. And I heard 
that they were

19:23.107 --> 19:33.941
going to take the horses out on a trip. And I said, 
no, you're not. I went over there, and he said,

19:38.528 --> 19:40.490
yeah. I said, well, we're going to take the horses 
on a trip. And I said, you can't move those horses

19:44.255 --> 19:47.560
now. You can ride them around town all you want to. 
But as far as moving them and taking them out of the

19:51.085 --> 19:59.053
city limits,

19:51.085 --> 19:59.053
you're not going to do it. Because if there's any 
such thing as infectious disease, that's bad, and

20:01.396 --> 20:10.004
they were right in the midst of an anthrax 
epidemic. You know how anthrax works.

20:18.828 --> 20:24.236
He didn't like it very much, but I told him, I said, 
he said, how are you going to stop me? I said, well,

20:24.296 --> 20:26.899
if you just try it, I'll show you. Because it won't 
take me 15 minutes to get the telephone and call

20:27.520 --> 20:33.929
Austin. And from Austin, I can get a man here in 24 
hours that will stop you. And that won't give the

20:48.747 --> 21:03.445
permission for you to take the horses out of the 
stable and take them out in the field.

21:06.509 --> 21:09.893
So were those horses eventually destroyed then? 
We didn't do anything at all. We just vaccinated

21:11.034 --> 21:12.536
them and that's it. I see. Were there times During 
these four years when you would have to destroy a

21:15.899 --> 21:19.264
herd? No, no, no one did have to destroy a herd. 
Good. No one did have to destroy a herd. A herd meant

21:26.373 --> 21:28.576
most of cattle. Yeah. No, no, no one did have to 
destroy a herd. I had to interview the horses I had

21:33.403 --> 21:36.627
to. Excuse

21:36.647 --> 21:41.273
me. Okay.

21:47.962 --> 21:58.953
Besides going around the state and vaccinating 
cattle and horses during those four years when you

21:47.962 --> 21:58.953
were a veterinarian for the state, did you do other 
things? No, no. I didn't do other things. I didn't

22:03.178 --> 22:05.440
have time to do other things. But I mean that was 
your main job. That was the main function of that

22:07.482 --> 22:09.544
job. The main job. They called into the state at 
Fort Worth and talked to the state veterinarian

22:10.425 --> 22:17.833
and he would get a job, whatever he wanted me to do. I 
wasn't scared. I was raised with horses and cows,

22:25.913 --> 22:30.098
and I wasn't scared of them. Now most of the men that 
were there, well, they said they wasn't, but they

22:31.260 --> 22:39.591
were. They were scared, and it was pretty hard to 
get them to go. But I always wanted to go. And so it

22:51.581 --> 22:53.804
wasn't going to be a bit in the world.

22:56.587 --> 23:01.634
Why did you decide to get out of veterinary 
medicine then and go to medical school? Why did you

23:01.734 --> 23:03.397
decide that changed in your life? Well, I always 
wanted to be a doctor. Why was that? Because my

23:08.844 --> 23:10.106
father would. But I wanted to go to A&M. And when I 
got through A&M, I had to have the money to go to

23:14.969 --> 23:22.697
medical school, so I had to work four years and make 
the money and save it. And at the end of four years,

23:23.978 --> 23:28.924
well, I had enough. And what I saved

23:29.905 --> 23:38.594
put me through the medical school. I see. Because I 
didn't spend anything for foolishness. And

23:45.462 --> 23:46.964
where'd you go to medical school? I went to

23:46.984 --> 23:56.695
Dallas to Baylor. Why'd you decide on Baylor? 
Well, it was, I thought, one of the best schools in

24:00.139 --> 24:08.029
medicine. And I wrote other places.

24:13.525 --> 24:16.067
I was accepted, but I didn't go. I wrote back and 
told them I decided to go to Baylor. And Baylor was

24:21.031 --> 24:25.535
close to Fort Worth, and Fort Worth was where my 
home was. That wasn't my home, right here. But I

24:28.017 --> 24:36.925
lived there in Fort Worth, so I knew Dallas pretty 
well. And so when I went to medical school, had to do

24:42.938 --> 24:47.484
was look around and find a place to live. And I went 
to the furniture people here in town and they were

24:48.845 --> 25:11.393
very nice to me and gave me a letter to the manager of 
one of the

24:48.845 --> 25:11.393
places I could purchase the desired furniture 
that I wanted.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.192
I was all fixed up. Okay. Now, do you remember in 
1916 when you were admitted to the vet school, do

25:16.294 --> 25:26.823
you remember what the entrance requirements were 
like or anything like that? Were you interviewed

25:26.843 --> 25:29.146
by professors here? No, no. We didn't have any 
interviews. They all knew me and it wasn't

25:33.590 --> 25:37.753
necessarily much. They knew more about me than I 
did about the school. But they didn't have any

25:42.997 --> 25:47.381
interviews at all. I don't know whether they have 
them any now or not. Well they did for a while, but

25:53.046 --> 26:03.215
they did for a while in the 30s and 40s and 50s, but 
now there's so many people that want to go to vet

25:53.046 --> 26:03.215
school that they don't interview anymore. When 
you were in the Corps, remember when you were in the

26:04.996 --> 26:11.822
Corps, we had a housing shortage. at Texas A&M 
during the 19-teens. Were you living in a tent

26:16.865 --> 26:18.307
then? Do you remember? Did you live at home? Oh, I 
remember tents. Do you remember the tents? Oh,

26:22.013 --> 26:22.253
yeah. Yeah, I remember them very well. They was all 
lined up on one side of Main Street, what we called

26:25.317 --> 26:36.072
Main Street, the street that led from the from the 
station up to school was the main road. Then they

26:46.378 --> 26:56.568
had the tents lined up there. Did you live in a tent 
or did you live at home? No, I stayed out in Colorado

26:58.550 --> 27:01.493
four years.

27:04.496 --> 27:05.637
I lived in one of the halls. Leggett Hall and Milner 
Hall and Foster Hall. I bet you living in the tents

27:11.175 --> 27:13.458
was a pretty rough life. Well it wasn't so rough. It 
was warm and we burnt wood then. Right, yeah. And

27:24.690 --> 27:34.881
the boys would, they would use the three to the room 
and they had large tents. I believe they were

27:35.852 --> 27:41.121
fourteen to twenty, I believe they were, but they 
were just one room. And three lived in those tents.

27:49.314 --> 27:58.810
Oh yeah, I was here very well, but living here made 
it, made them close to me to get to. made a lot easier

27:59.279 --> 28:01.222
probably. Well, it did. I knew it. I knew the school 
and knew the professors. Right. Did your dad know

28:08.031 --> 28:12.678
the professors over there pretty well because he 
was a medical doctor and had contact? Oh yes, he

28:12.698 --> 28:14.200
knew the main ones. He knew Dean Francis, the head 
of school, and Mark Stella was

28:26.043 --> 28:34.952
was

28:26.043 --> 28:34.952
the chief

28:26.043 --> 28:34.952
medical man. He taught us the diseases of 
ambulance and he also had the,

28:35.373 --> 28:54.733
I guess you'd call it the dispensary.

28:56.418 --> 28:59.041
So he had all the boys. Well, let's talk about those 
teachers who were the ones who really established

28:59.902 --> 29:08.674
the vet school back in the 19-teens. Can you tell us 
about Mark Francis? Well, Mark Francis came there

29:11.557 --> 29:13.820
from Ohio State. He graduated from Ohio State, and 
he came directly from Ohio State to A&M, and they

29:13.920 --> 29:25.395
didn't have vet medicine at A&M. I think that was 
one reason why they developed the School of

29:25.510 --> 29:33.604
Veterinary Medicine.

29:35.086 --> 29:39.113
So he taught anatomy. What kind of teacher was he? 
Oh, he was a very good teacher. Very good teacher.

29:47.487 --> 29:49.530
Was he a hard or an easy grader? Do you remember?

29:55.970 --> 29:58.234
I just don't know. I can't answer that question 
very well. He wasn't hard on the students or

30:02.841 --> 30:08.210
anything like that, but he'd take it in the 
foosters. And if they had any foosters about them,

30:10.594 --> 30:23.074
he'd pick them out and tell them to either quit the 
foosters or leave school.

30:23.611 --> 30:29.319
Those that couldn't take it were left and those 
that could take it were quit it and they stayed. As

30:31.902 --> 30:37.269
long as they was able to pass the work. Now did you 
like him as a person? Did you think he was a nice

30:39.592 --> 30:41.515
person to know? Well, he was a man that

30:51.134 --> 30:54.058
Now we're talking about the dean.

30:57.422 --> 31:16.146
He was a man that

30:57.422 --> 31:16.146
was very

30:57.422 --> 31:16.146
likeable to the boys. He would know them and how to 
do it and something like that and then go on. He

31:25.214 --> 31:27.579
wouldn't stop and talk and so forth and so on. And he 
was hard of hearing and that's another reason why

31:28.681 --> 31:37.560
he was
