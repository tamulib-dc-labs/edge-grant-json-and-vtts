WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:06.942
as good in the javelin as he was in the shot put and 
the discus. I guess he was most consistent in the

00:07.143 --> 00:18.357
discus and was better, comparatively speaking, 
than the other athletes against whom he competed.

00:18.718 --> 00:24.906
And he consistently won at Texas Relays, Kansas 
Relays, and Drake. And he also placed very highly,

00:25.807 --> 00:32.856
I don't recall just how high, in the NCAA and AAU 
meet. but George was a consistent point producer,

00:33.747 --> 00:39.415
a good friend, a good man. He was also in Who's Who, 
American colleges and universities, a very good

00:40.176 --> 00:49.189
student, very popular on campus. J.D. Hampton, a 
distance man, class of 50, was another athlete

00:50.731 --> 00:57.681
that we admired. J.D. and George were 
co-captains, as I recall, in 1950. JD set the

01:06.087 --> 01:08.751
conference record in the mile. He also ran the two 
mile and most of the time would win his event until

01:09.732 --> 01:31.885
we started running into the Midwestern schools 
and of course Kansas and Iowa and Iowa State and

01:09.732 --> 01:31.885
Oklahoma A&M they had always produced distance 
men and that was something that other than J.D.

01:33.291 --> 01:38.696
Hampton and Jerry Thompson at Texas, the 
Southwest Conference just didn't have distance

01:33.291 --> 01:38.696
men.

01:41.739 --> 01:46.764
Now, in your era, basketball, G. Raleigh wasn't 
built yet, was it? No, we played basketball in the

01:47.285 --> 01:54.952
little cracker box, the cozy little cracker box of 
DeWare Fieldhouse. Describe an Aggie basketball

01:55.132 --> 01:58.315
game in those days. Oh, it was loud, and the house 
was packed. because what else were you going to do

02:02.628 --> 02:16.043
on a weekend or a weeknight at College Station if 
you didn't go to Guyon Hall

02:02.628 --> 02:16.043
and you didn't have a car? You'd go to the 
basketball game, and besides, the upperclassmen

02:16.544 --> 02:24.193
would make sure that you would show up at the 
basketball game. Were there any pranks or tricks

02:25.074 --> 02:32.382
that you all played on the enemy, like the 
Longhorns? It didn't make any difference whether

02:32.699 --> 02:35.582
they were Longhorns or not. It just made it sweeter 
if we could do it for the Longhorn. But the stands in

02:38.685 --> 02:49.636
DeWare Field House were arranged in such a manner 
that they were right on the edge of the

02:38.685 --> 02:49.636
out-of-bounds line. In fact, I think there was 
only three or four feet between the out-of-bounds

02:49.676 --> 02:58.285
line and where the concrete stands started. And 
the upperclassmen would have, we freshmen, sit on

03:02.534 --> 03:07.803
these concrete lips underneath the iron railing 
that went around. And whenever the opposing team

03:08.724 --> 03:19.242
got the ball out of bounds, it was our job to try to 
kick the ball out of their hands while they were

03:08.724 --> 03:19.242
trying to inbounds it. And the referees didn't 
care for that too much, and especially the

03:19.923 --> 03:25.051
opposing coach. But Marty Corot, who was the coach 
then, Marty didn't mind it at all. Anything that we

03:31.676 --> 03:34.939
could do would have been a help. Do you remember any 
special moments during an Aggie basketball game,

03:35.560 --> 03:40.686
one of a kind? Well, it was always fun to watch Buddy 
Davis and John DeWitt work. They were our two tall

03:47.574 --> 03:48.995
men. Buddy, of course, was 6'10", 6'11". DeWitt 
was about 6'4", 6'5".

03:58.458 --> 04:01.943
DeWitt was also one of the most versatile athletes 
we ever had here. John was all Southwest

04:03.265 --> 04:12.959
Conference in basketball, baseball, and he won 
the Southwest Conference 440 in track in 1952.

04:14.782 --> 04:28.161
John was a class of 51, but he was taking a five-year 
architecture program, and he played his first

04:14.782 --> 04:28.161
three years of eligibility out in basketball and 
baseball and then asked Colonel Andy if he could

04:28.951 --> 04:32.095
come out for track. Colonel Andy had seen John run 
in intramurals before and had timed him in 50 flat.

04:39.925 --> 04:44.731
And so Colonel Andy was just salivating to get John 
out there on the track. And he did, and John proved

04:45.412 --> 04:58.789
his worth and won the conference 440 in 1952, which 
was his fifth year, but actually his first year of

04:45.412 --> 04:58.789
track eligibility. And football. Football.

05:06.104 --> 05:07.786
Buddy Schaefer, I've already mentioned. What 
about Bob Smith? We had Bob Smith. Bob and I had

05:12.231 --> 05:16.877
played football and run track against each other 
in high school. He was class of 51. And

05:18.479 --> 05:29.873
I'd never seen a better running back, a better 
slasher than Bob Smith. And if he ever got past the

05:30.157 --> 05:33.621
line of scrimmage, it was all over. He would really 
punish a linebacker, and a halfback didn't have a

05:35.623 --> 05:39.727
chance. You'd have to hit him low, hit him around 
the ankles. You couldn't tackle him. You'd just

05:46.494 --> 05:52.300
have to hit him with a body block and hope you got him 
between you and the sidelines to knock him out of

05:46.494 --> 05:52.300
bounds. And I saw him run for 285 yards against Kyle 
Roach and SMU. in 1950 in the Cotton Bowl, and we

05:59.435 --> 06:07.083
beat them 25 to 20. He set a new NCAA rushing record, 
285 yards in that game. We also had Glenn Lippman,

06:14.451 --> 06:18.035
who was in my class, class 52. El Campo? Yeah, from 
El Campo. El Campo produced some fine athletes and

06:21.579 --> 06:26.384
fine students. Glenn Lippman Elo Noavitza, who 
was a guard, and Jero Natartus, who was an end. All

06:33.585 --> 06:38.009
three were in the top ten academically. Jero was 
valedictorian of our class. And I don't recall

06:41.953 --> 06:49.180
exactly where Glenn and Elo placed, but they were 
in the top ten. I'm grinning because all three of

06:49.600 --> 06:53.104
them obviously were of Irish ancestry. Yeah. 
Elo... ELO was a Czech ancestry. Glenn Lipman was

07:01.239 --> 07:07.925
German, possibly German-Jewish, I'm not sure. 
And Gero was Greek. And Glenn went on into

07:11.508 --> 07:19.295
mechanical engineering and went with some large 
engineering firm. I don't recall which. As far as

07:22.077 --> 07:27.762
you know, did most all of those athletic friends of 
yours in their later lives, did they have the kind

07:28.282 --> 07:34.430
of achievement that you assumed they would? 
Absolutely. Absolutely. They were tops in their

07:37.594 --> 07:48.789
field, and you called them boss five years after 
graduation.

07:48.829 --> 07:57.681
Glenn was a supervisor of officials for the 
Southwest Conference in later years, and I would

07:48.829 --> 07:57.681
see him at all of our home football games. here in 
the Letterman's Association, and his job was to

07:58.268 --> 08:07.663
evaluate the job that the officials did during the 
football games. Jarrow was in the banking and

08:07.723 --> 08:15.295
savings and loan business, and I'm not clear about 
what Elo did. I haven't seen Elo since, but I see

08:15.996 --> 08:23.027
Glenn frequently and Jarrow occasionally. Now, I 
wrote down before we turned the machine on,

08:23.547 --> 08:27.033
athletic tales. What are some of those? Well, 
those are many and varied.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.574
I'll start with Bones Irving first. Bones was, 
shall we say, frugal. And to give you an example,

08:52.133 --> 09:01.586
After we got lights in Kyle Field, Bones would have 
the lights turned off in Kyle Field before the

08:52.133 --> 09:01.586
crowd got out of the stadium. And they would have to 
make their way out of the stadium in the dark and

09:01.606 --> 09:10.099
find their cars in the dark because he wanted to 
save on electricity. Bones drove a hard bargain

09:11.280 --> 09:21.735
when it came to getting

09:11.280 --> 09:21.735
not amenities, but what I would call necessities 
out of the athletic director. Even though Dog

09:24.826 --> 09:30.413
Dawson was the financial manager, Bones always 
had the last say. And I remember Colonel Andy

09:31.574 --> 09:44.910
pleading with Bones to get a bus to take us on long 
trips, you know, a passenger type bus. And Bones's

09:44.930 --> 09:50.997
first concession to that, that I recall in my 
sophomore year, he let us take what we referred to

09:51.685 --> 09:58.275
as the Blue Goose, which was a long-stretched 
Chevrolet. It was actually a Chevrolet sedan that

09:58.295 --> 10:08.712
had been cut in half and four or five seats put in it, 
and you could carry about 12 to 14 or 15 people. We

10:10.454 --> 10:17.305
would have to take the Blue Goose from here to the 
Kansas Relays at Lawrence, Kansas. We would start

10:17.572 --> 10:45.840
out early in the morning, Colonel Andy drove, he 
could barely see over the steering wheel, and he

10:17.572 --> 10:45.840
was a short guy, and we would drive to Dallas, have 
lunch at Wyatt's Cafeteria, and he would be there

10:17.572 --> 10:45.840
at the cash register to take up our chits, our 
checks as we came out, and he would examine each one

10:17.572 --> 10:45.840
carefully and look askance at you if the total went 
over more than $3. You'd get a lot of food for $3 in

10:46.747 --> 10:49.410
those days. George Cadera and I were the budget 
busters. I was always a chow hound, and of course

10:54.296 --> 10:58.140
Cadera weighed about 245. He was a big guy. And we 
would usually have the largest tickets. We'd

11:03.126 --> 11:13.678
drive on up to Orange, Kansas the next day, compete 
in the preliminaries, finals on Saturday, drive

11:03.126 --> 11:13.678
back on Sunday. We'd stay in a dormitory on campus. 
The following, two weeks after the Kansas relays,

11:19.567 --> 11:26.134
they would have the Drake relays in Des Moines, 
Iowa. Ooh, long drive. Well, we rebelled. We told

11:30.559 --> 11:37.226
Colonel Andy that that is too far to be driving the 
Blue Goose. That's three days, and you can't

11:37.286 --> 11:43.373
expect us to do that and run in a track meet. And he 
allowed us out. That was right, and he went to Bones

11:46.537 --> 11:50.381
to see what Bones could do about it. He initially, I 
think, was going to try to go for a passenger bus,

11:51.322 --> 11:58.028
but even so, that would have been a brutal trip. So 
he finally got with his friend Clyde Littlefield

11:59.009 --> 12:08.118
down in Texas, and he and Clyde Littlefield agreed 
to share a Pullman. The Pullman would originate at

12:08.138 --> 12:10.140
Austin. It would travel on Southern Pacific to 
Houston, where it would switch off to the Rock

12:10.180 --> 12:15.565
Island line, We would jump in the Blue Goose and go 
over to North Zulich and you had to flag the train

12:16.523 --> 12:26.292
down at North Zulich. But he had an agreement with 
the engineer, the conductor, that we would be out

12:26.312 --> 12:34.420
there and we would flag the train down at the water 
tower. There was a water tower there and a very

12:34.540 --> 12:39.365
small railway station. So we're all out there on 
the side of the railroad track with our baggage And

12:45.565 --> 12:55.478
here comes the train, and Colonel Landy sees the 
train, and he goes out there in the middle of the

12:45.565 --> 12:55.478
track, and he's waving his arms back and forth so 
that the engineer could see him. Well, the train is

12:56.419 --> 13:08.135
blowing its whistle and all this kind of stuff, and 
the train is getting closer and closer, and we're

12:56.419 --> 13:08.135
all worried because Colonel Landy is just waving 
harder and harder. And he was jumping up and down.

13:11.039 --> 13:13.962
Stop, USOB, stop. Finally... George Cadera and 
somebody else, they grabbed him and pulled him off

13:16.801 --> 13:21.306
of the track. The train went right on by, but it 
stopped up at the water tower. And that was where

13:28.514 --> 13:30.997
the engineer planned on stopping. 
Coincidentally, it would place the Pullman where

13:31.538 --> 13:37.604
we were waiting for it at the tracks. So, Colonel 
Andy's antics went for naught. We'd get on the

13:41.409 --> 13:45.373
train and enjoy the Pullman trip up there. We knew 
all the Texas guys. We were all friends. We were

13:48.302 --> 13:51.286
competitors, but friends nevertheless. Now, in a 
meet like those two, about how many Aggie track

13:51.467 --> 13:55.833
team members went?

13:58.658 --> 14:03.705
We would

13:58.658 --> 14:03.705
take a mile relay team. That's four people. The 
first year, my sophomore year that I went, we took

14:06.409 --> 14:13.420
three herders, Bob Hall, Bill Bless, and myself, 
We took Jack Simpson, who was a pole vaulter, and

14:14.125 --> 14:19.890
George Cadera, who was a weight man. Oh, and J.D. 
Hampton and Julian Herring, because they had a

14:21.831 --> 14:28.697
good chance of placing in the distance events. So 
10 to 12. 10 to 12 guys, and we always did well at

14:29.758 --> 14:37.124
Drake Relays. Now what did you, as you're going 
back and forth, what did you wear? We wore... We

14:44.753 --> 14:48.679
wore sport coats and slacks. Didn't wear 
warm-ups? No. On the train? No. We were

14:55.308 --> 15:02.118
representing Texas A&M, and the Texas athletes 
dressed accordingly. It was just an unwritten

15:03.300 --> 15:05.703
rule. Did the Aggies and the Longhorn track team, 
did they sit near each other and talk? Oh, yeah. We

15:14.065 --> 15:17.829
had poker games, bridge games on the train. As I 
say, we were friendly competitors. What were

15:21.333 --> 15:29.923
either spoken or not spoken but clearly 
understood, what were Coach Andy's rules for

15:21.333 --> 15:29.923
y'all? Colonel Andy's. In regard to what? When you 
were traveling. What were you not to do and what

15:34.728 --> 15:39.333
were you to do when you were away from this campus? 
Conduct ourselves like gentlemen. We're

15:42.917 --> 15:43.718
representatives. Texas A&M. We take our books and 
make sure we study because when you go on a trip like

15:46.094 --> 15:53.243
that, you're gone for the better part of a week. And 
take your books, study, help each other. Just the

16:01.434 --> 16:02.195
way it was. Did anybody do any smoking?

16:07.281 --> 16:09.464
Yeah. Jack Simpson would go out on the train 
platform. Jack was a vet. and of course he had

16:14.275 --> 16:25.806
smoked when he was in the service and he still had 
the habit and Bob Hall would be known to

16:14.275 --> 16:25.806
occasionally smoke. Could anybody have a beer if 
they wanted to? Did Colonel Andy have a policy

16:28.649 --> 16:32.472
about that on a trip? Colonel Andy had no policies 
about smoking or drinking. It was just understood

16:42.288 --> 17:11.957
you're grown up now and uh if you smoke and drink 
it's your own detriment you're not hurting me okay

16:42.288 --> 17:11.957
colonel andy but there were no rules we i never knew 
of anybody dismissed from the track team for a

16:42.288 --> 17:11.957
quote violation of team rules we we didn't have any 
we policed ourselves the captains would take care

16:42.288 --> 17:11.957
of that coach didn't have to worry about it and you 
normally on those uh to the relays, you stayed in a

17:12.545 --> 17:16.149
dorm. When you went to the Southwest Conference 
meets, where did y'all stay? In motels? First of

17:21.113 --> 17:24.957
all, when we went to Kansas, we stayed in dorms. 
When we went to Des Moines Island, we stayed in the

17:24.977 --> 17:28.100
Drake Hotel. Oh, okay. We went first class. Okay. 
And that surprised us, because we weren't used to

17:30.683 --> 17:34.406
that kind of thing. What about in the... When we 
went to the Southwest Conference meet,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.742
We stayed in a motel. I believe it was the South 
Congress Motel, or South Austin Motel on South

17:47.343 --> 17:54.469
Congress.

17:57.072 --> 17:58.593
Let's see, other athletic tales. Well,

18:01.075 --> 18:12.285
when we would go to Laredo,

18:01.075 --> 18:12.285
the first, my sophomore year, we took the Blue 
Goose. you couldn't get away from that ubiquitous

18:12.434 --> 18:17.119
blue goose. And we'd cram everybody in there and 
put the poles on top and the javelins on top and all

18:17.139 --> 18:25.967
this and lash them down. And as we would go through 
South Texas, the upperclassmen had told we

18:27.129 --> 18:41.783
lower-classmen, now when we get down here to a 
certain spot in Falferius County, Colonel

18:42.674 --> 18:45.779
Landy's going to tell you a story about a deer that 
he shot. And so we got ready, and sure enough, we

18:47.020 --> 18:56.434
passed a certain spot in Thalferius County, and 
Colonel Landy would say, you see that live oak tree

18:47.020 --> 18:56.434
over there? He says, I killed a buck over there, and 
I went over to see about him, and all of a sudden he

18:57.055 --> 19:12.478
jumped up and charged me, and I had my hunting 
knife, and we wrestled for ten minutes, and I

18:57.055 --> 19:12.478
finally cut his throat. Going down to Lareda, he 
would point that out. Coming back from Lareda, he

19:16.777 --> 19:19.559
would point that out. For three years, I got that 
story. And I don't know how many years he's been

19:23.684 --> 19:25.886
telling it. Did you all go across the river? We took 
the Blue Goose across the river. And that was a

19:32.232 --> 19:38.458
mistake, because that Blue Goose was pretty long, 
and it had a long wheelbase. And you just couldn't

19:39.119 --> 19:42.482
maneuver in some of those. side streets down 
there. And we went down to Boys Town just to see what

19:44.611 --> 19:49.719
it was like. And we went to the Cadillac bar to have a 
queso dinner. This is after the meet, of course.

19:56.909 --> 20:00.995
And have one of those famous margaritas. And 
Colonel Andy never went with us. He stayed at the

20:04.400 --> 20:05.943
hotel. My senior year, we chartered a regular 
passenger bus and took the wives. Those of us who

20:16.976 --> 20:21.423
could afford to, we'd have to pay for the wives' 
rooms. And we would, all the boys would stay in

20:22.745 --> 20:35.484
their own room through the track team, and the 
wives would bunk up together down the hall in the

20:22.745 --> 20:35.484
hotel. But things improved considerably. I don't 
know where Bones found the money to do that,

20:41.947 --> 20:47.537
whether he was getting a little more liberal in his 
dotage. Now, of all of the athletic experiences

20:48.499 --> 21:04.748
you recall of your own,

20:48.499 --> 21:04.748
can you recall one or two that were among the most 
amusing, the goofiest, most ludicrous?

21:07.816 --> 21:15.667
One other story about Cadera and Colonel Andy, and 
it had nothing to do with athletics. It just

21:15.768 --> 21:17.530
occurred on an athletic trip. We were going to 
Kansas for the Kansas Relays, and Cadera always

21:18.471 --> 21:30.269
carried his own shot and discus with him, and he put 
them in a duffel bag. Colonel Andy told Cadera to

21:31.410 --> 21:37.018
put those things up on top of the blue goose. Uh-oh. 
I don't want those things down here in the

21:37.972 --> 21:43.417
passenger compartment. Well, Cadera was afraid 
the shot would get away from him up there on the

21:43.537 --> 21:50.624
roof, and he would lose it. So he sat on the back seat 
of the bus and stuffed that duffel bag underneath

21:51.585 --> 22:04.236
the back seat, put his feet on top of it, and we rode 
that way all the way up to Kansas. About the time we

22:04.256 --> 22:07.219
started leaving Oklahoma, started into Kansas. 
An old farmer and his pickup truck pulled out from a

22:10.224 --> 22:15.873
side road and Colonel Andy had a jam on the brakes 
real hard. Well that shot broke loose from that

22:17.055 --> 22:28.895
duffel bag and went up to the front of the Blue Goose 
and it hit the firewall right under Colonel Andy's

22:17.055 --> 22:28.895
feet. He stopped the Blue Goose and ran around to 
the back seat, and he had Cadera out of there by his

22:34.368 --> 22:38.051
ear. And he said, Cadera, you blagging like SOB? I 
told you to put that thing up. You could have broken

22:44.517 --> 22:47.579
our legs. And Cadera sheepishly sat in the back 
seat and held that shot put in his lap for the rest of

22:47.980 --> 22:57.708
the trip. That's a good one. That's a good one. 
Other amusing ones that involve, any amusing ones

23:00.550 --> 23:03.733
that involved you? Whether pranks or otherwise. 
Well, I wasn't one given to playing pranks on our

23:09.425 --> 23:18.334
trips. Well, if you want to call dropping water 
balloons out of the window at the Worthington

23:18.354 --> 23:27.363
Hotel in Fort Worth, pranks, yeah. Who were y'all 
dropping them on? We don't know. Who ever happened

23:31.107 --> 23:32.568
to be down there? Nobody got caught. No, because 
right after we dropped them, we disappeared. And

23:42.621 --> 23:49.367
all of your track efforts here, what were your 
proudest moments? Well, I suppose one

23:51.930 --> 24:02.560
of my most proud moments was when I won the low 
hurdles and the Drake relays in a snowstorm. I just

24:07.476 --> 24:09.178
out mudded everybody else. It wasn't that I was all 
that fast because truth be known if we were to line

24:09.238 --> 24:17.910
up for a 100 yard dash I'd probably come in last. But 
I had strength and power and the mud and the slush

24:18.851 --> 24:29.545
didn't bother me and it bothered the shorter 
legged people a lot more. I could go into overdrive

24:29.585 --> 24:32.209
a lot easier than they could. and then gutting it 
out against Valjo Walker in the Southwest

24:33.050 --> 24:49.454
Conference meet here in 1951 when I ran faster than 
I ever thought I could, and so did Walker. Now, what

24:51.797 --> 24:55.302
was your best time that you ever did? In the highs, 
it was 14.2. In the lows, it was 22.9. All right,

25:02.362 --> 25:04.665
those are happy moments. Any real disappointing 
moment? Frustrating? No. I

25:12.816 --> 25:20.005
was, I was forking it. Colonel Andy called me his 
money player. He said if I was going to go to a horse

25:23.370 --> 25:27.255
race, I'd put my money on you because you ought to 
You either win, place, or show. And that was true. I

25:31.319 --> 25:35.503
placed in every event that I ever entered. Now, 
your worst injury was when you hurt your knee? My

25:39.506 --> 25:48.815
worst injury occurred

25:39.506 --> 25:48.815
in the spring of my senior year at the Border 
Olympics at Laredo. That was also an Olympic year.

25:51.817 --> 25:56.061
I had my sights set on going to the Olympic tryout. 
And I had a pretty good chance. And I had trained

25:59.387 --> 26:08.157
hard in the off-season, and we had gone with the 
Sugar Bowl track meet, which meant that we had to

25:59.387 --> 26:08.157
train during the winter as well. And I had won the 
highs at the Border Olympics, and we lined up for

26:10.059 --> 26:23.955
the lows, and we had a pretty impressive field 
there with Bobby Joe Ragsdale from A&M. Billy

26:24.374 --> 26:29.702
Bless, Valjo Walker, Ralph Person from Texas. All 
these guys were capable of breaking the

26:30.463 --> 26:33.228
conference record. And several of us had and 
several of us did that year. In fact, all of us did

26:39.517 --> 26:44.805
that year, just not in the conference meet 
necessarily. And I was leading going over the

26:45.987 --> 26:52.457
fourth hurdle, which was unusual for me. I would 
usually make up the ground in the latter part of the

26:53.112 --> 27:01.224
race when the short legged guys were trying to 
stretch it to the next hurdle. Now I was leading

27:01.585 --> 27:14.744
over the fourth hurdle and I kicked out my right leg 
first to go over the hurdle and something snapped

27:01.585 --> 27:14.744
right behind and just above my knee. That 
quadriceps muscle had, or the lower part of the

27:19.690 --> 27:49.107
gluteus maximus had come loose and I felt like I'd 
been shot and I was in the middle lane everybody of

27:19.690 --> 27:49.107
course went past me and nothing flat and I hobbled 
on one leg over to the grass and pitched out and

27:19.690 --> 27:49.107
grabbed my leg and started moaning and groaning 
and I was out for two months it was two months before

27:19.690 --> 27:49.107
I could get back in action And of course, that put me 
two months behind everybody else. And I got back in

27:53.982 --> 27:59.307
some semblance of shape and was able to run. By the 
time we went out to a four-way meet at the Los

28:00.408 --> 28:19.245
Angeles Coliseum with Southern Cal, UCLA, and 
Texas, we drove to Fort Worth, got on a DC-7, and

28:00.408 --> 28:19.245
flew out to Los Angeles. and gave a good account of 
ourselves out there. We finished, barely

28:24.132 --> 28:28.596
finished second to USC. I think we would have won 
the meet, but one of our regular mile relay guys

28:29.557 --> 28:49.637
stepped in a hole on the infield where they have the 
water faucets to turn on the, and he stepped in the

28:29.557 --> 28:49.637
hole and sprained his ankle, and we had to use a 
substitute guy on the mile relay, and just barely

28:50.309 --> 28:55.636
got beaten in the mile relay. Otherwise, we would 
have won that meet. But I got back in some semblance

28:58.580 --> 29:01.904
of shape. I ran second to Jack.

29:10.235 --> 29:12.318
His last name escapes me now. But he was the 
previous year's NCAA champion. And later that

29:16.415 --> 29:19.920
year set a new world record, 13.5. So I stayed 
within sight of him, but that was about it. Then in

29:26.010 --> 29:35.203
the Southwest Conference meet, Valjo Walker won 
that. Willie Valls from Texas was second. And I was

29:38.529 --> 29:41.573
about a foot behind Willie. And I ran 14.3. which 
surprised me. And of course I was out of the running

29:47.966 --> 29:58.199
as far as going to the Olympic trials was concerned 
due to losing that two months. Now y'all didn't

29:59.281 --> 30:06.430
have, during your years, were no tragedies that 
you and your buddies had to cope with? Nobody broke

30:07.171 --> 30:11.676
a leg, nobody got killed, nobody had a bad car 
wreck? No. Minor stuff. Yeah. Let's see, you

30:15.545 --> 30:17.988
mentioned tutoring. Describe that.

30:23.994 --> 30:33.142
Our freshman class, we had a good group of 
students, and we had some students who didn't do as

30:23.994 --> 30:33.142
well as others. Put it that way. And the midterm 
grades came out in about the second or third week of

30:35.124 --> 30:42.852
January. And then we took a midterm break, come 
back to register for the spring on the 30th of

30:43.540 --> 30:50.009
January. When I got back from spring, we didn't 
call it spring break then. I don't recall what we

30:58.922 --> 31:01.025
called it. Easter. No, it wasn't Easter. This was 
the 30th of January. Oh, semester. We used to call

31:06.994 --> 31:08.676
it semester break. When I got back from that, Dog 
Dawson, came up to the dorm one evening and said, I

31:13.780 --> 31:18.054
need to talk to you. Sure, Doc. He said, some of our 
guys
