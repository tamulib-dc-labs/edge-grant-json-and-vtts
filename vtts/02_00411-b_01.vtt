00:00.993 --> 00:03.516
Remembering those things. When they were going 
from Chihuahua to Adama disguised as peasants, my

00:03.536 --> 00:17.510
father had told my mother that if they ever got 
stopped on the way, that if they asked any

00:03.536 --> 00:17.510
questions, they were going to visit relatives at 
Adama.

00:20.192 --> 00:26.499
And after a while of traveling, they got stopped 
from some armed men. They were asked, where are you

00:26.519 --> 00:28.481
going? And she said, well, we are going to 
Chihuahua, I mean the Aldamara, he's a relative.

00:36.223 --> 00:41.875
And my father, he was, had a sarap that was wrapped 
around him, you know, so they couldn't see his

00:36.223 --> 00:41.875
face, you know. And then they asked him, well, 
what's wrong with him? You know, they meant why he

00:46.064 --> 00:49.571
doesn't say, he says something. Uh-huh. My 
brother, because he's got a wound in his leg. Oh,

00:55.592 --> 00:58.537
boy. Oh, my God. And then what happened? Well, then 
my father just went up and said, well, I was out

01:00.681 --> 01:10.400
hunting two or three years ago, and I shot myself in 
the leg because I don't know too much about

01:00.681 --> 01:10.400
firearms. And they just laughed, you know. And I 
said, well. Let him go. And after that, my father

01:14.990 --> 01:19.800
really got mad at my mother. Hurt them? Yeah. And he 
got shot? Yeah, and he had a wound. Well, he was

01:26.874 --> 01:27.856
scared. I mean, he always knows. Every time she saw 
a man like that, she remembered what she went

01:30.262 --> 01:39.690
through and she forgot what she was supposed to 
say. Poor thing. She was afraid of your father,

01:42.193 --> 01:44.795
wasn't she? She was. She was.

01:48.739 --> 01:52.162
She used to tell us, I don't know why I married that 
man. I didn't love him, but I had to marry him or

01:52.882 --> 01:58.227
else.

02:00.181 --> 02:07.110
Yes, I remember the time that, she told me about it, 
she did. I mean, my mother didn't tell me too many

02:07.310 --> 02:15.060
things about his life, you know. My mother, she 
says that the doctor, they operated on him three or

02:15.080 --> 02:24.012
four times, the same woman.

02:29.982 --> 02:35.968
And he told the doctors that he wanted his leg 
saved, but tried. But Dr. Hefner, Chihuahua, told

02:37.230 --> 02:44.517
him the leg had to come off because it was going to be 
useless. It was going to be just in his way. And my

02:49.542 --> 02:56.850
mother told him that he warned the doctor, he said, 
if you cut my leg off, I'm going to kill you. The

02:57.016 --> 03:00.419
doctor, he didn't believe him, too. Because, you 
know, he's a patient. And one of his friends told

03:02.621 --> 03:05.364
him, you'd better do what he says. Don't cut his leg 
off, because, don't kill him, because if he wants

03:07.406 --> 03:12.851
his leg, let him keep his leg. So they let him keep 
his leg, but it was no good to him. He was always

03:19.397 --> 03:21.860
limping, wasn't he? No. Remember Chester? 
Chester? Gunsmoke? That's the way my father had

03:25.720 --> 03:29.404
his leg, stiff. He could never bend it. He could 
never bend it. Had he been a foot soldier or did he,

03:33.489 --> 03:36.092
was he a cavalry? He was in the cavalry. He had a 
horse. Did you show her that picture with all the

03:40.437 --> 03:45.483
things in his head and everything? Yeah. He was 
proud to be one of, to be this man. They were all

03:49.047 --> 03:50.889
crazy. They were all crazy. Well, tell about your 
father wanting your mother to go to Chihuahua

03:52.771 --> 03:57.297
before you were born. Well, I don't know what it is. 
I guess he planned on going back as soon as he could.

04:06.908 --> 04:09.572
And he wanted me to be born in Chihuahua.

04:12.956 --> 04:19.504
And the only reason that my mother, she was afraid 
that they did. Trin would be stopping, and one of

04:20.108 --> 04:29.459
the relatives talked to my father, and she got to 
agree, you know, to be born here in El Paso. But your

04:30.060 --> 04:31.802
parents were born in Chihuahua? Oh, I mean, were 
they married? They were married in Chihuahua. In

04:36.888 --> 04:39.171
Chihuahua, they were married in Chihuahua. Yeah, 
they never dreamed of ever coming to the United

04:39.852 --> 04:43.897
States. They never did. But since that incident 
when the Morgia was after him and wanted him there

04:47.075 --> 04:55.384
alive, he had to leave the country.

04:58.027 --> 05:00.170
And I guess you could call him a refugee. Well, how 
come my parents, I mean my father, my family and my

05:01.391 --> 05:08.699
father, since 1910, they were here. They start 
this because I heard from my aunt in Santa Rita,

05:17.011 --> 05:20.916
They had to leave the ranch, because they were near 
there, see? And they were taking all the girls. So

05:24.500 --> 05:28.405
they just left since 9th and 10th, and they never 
returned. So at that time, everything was

05:30.148 --> 05:34.533
happening by . That's .

05:52.533 --> 05:55.098
I don't know. Because I remember when my aunt was 
telling me about Camaro, the people that he burned

05:55.118 --> 06:04.998
over there in Camaro, and the hoyo, you know, 
loyote, grandote. Have you been to Camaro? No.

06:06.622 --> 06:07.544
There's a big hole. I don't know if they fixed it 
already or not, but where he burned all the people.

06:14.369 --> 06:14.990
Children? I don't know. I think that's just a 
story. It isn't. It isn't. Were they alive when he

06:19.156 --> 06:21.139
burned them? Oh, yes. He put some, what's it, 
petroleum? He burned them alive. Why? I don't

06:26.626 --> 06:27.728
know. Because he was crazy. I don't know. Was this 
Villa? Villa. Don't you remember? I don't know.

06:33.155 --> 06:35.579
You can ask my Tio Rodolfo. He was there. They were 
there. Is he still alive? Oh, yes. He's an old man

06:40.646 --> 06:42.148
now. You can tell they were there.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.347
I know that they used to hang a lot of people. I know 
about the hanging. Yeah. Because there's a tree

06:51.249 --> 06:58.397
over there in the Mera Placita, Camargo, where 
they just put the ropes. Well, when I was a

06:58.817 --> 07:05.184
youngster and I used to go to Chihuahua, we used to 
go to the river. And they used to show me the trees,

07:07.888 --> 07:10.971
the tall, big, old, tall trees. where

07:11.153 --> 07:19.070
they used to hang people from.

07:22.617 --> 07:26.345
Did they say why they hung them? Well, the people 
that were hanging there were villistas. And they

07:30.093 --> 07:31.255
tell me, that they hung a lot of innocent people 
just because they looked villista. I mean, they

07:37.570 --> 07:53.590
actually didn't know for sure if they were 
villista, but there were so many people, you know,

07:37.570 --> 07:53.590
that they'd pick them out on the street or went to 
knock on the door of a house, and whoever answered

07:37.570 --> 07:53.590
there, he looked like a villista. So they rang him 
out. I mean, they were just ignorant people like he

07:56.328 --> 07:59.872
is. Maybe they would have been used to that. Maybe 
they were only passing by him.

08:11.863 --> 08:15.747
I don't know an old man that retired from 
mountains. He didn't go to Juarez for about 25

08:15.767 --> 08:18.550
years. And this is what happened to him because he 
told me about it. He was already living here and

08:21.453 --> 08:25.677
working here in El Paso. And he was from Zacatecas. 
In fact, he knew my relatives down there. He said

08:32.326 --> 08:38.695
that one time he went to Juarez when they had this, 
the attack Juarez, remember? Well, he went to

08:38.995 --> 08:44.323
Juarez and he was just the bystander that picked 
him out. And they put him in between some soldiers

08:45.856 --> 08:53.109
and took him down to the guarnición or whatever you 
call it, I mean the cuartel or garrison. And they

08:55.172 --> 08:58.257
interrogated him and they asked him a lot of 
questions. And he said the way it looked, they were

08:59.259 --> 09:04.248
ready to shoot him. He was scared and stiff, you 
know. And then a man there in Juarez that knows him

09:11.911 --> 09:22.002
by, well, I think it's, he used to own Balderas

09:11.911 --> 09:22.002
Bullring. He called him Gonzales. He was going by. 
He says, Rafael, what are you doing there? Come

09:31.191 --> 09:31.652
over here. He says, tell these people who I am. Tell 
them where I live. He says, you know, he told them

09:34.875 --> 09:39.640
who he was and where he lived, so let him go. And as 
soon as he got back to El Paso, that was it. He went

09:43.250 --> 09:46.313
back to the Quarters for about 25 years. In fact, I 
think he started going to the Quarters when I

09:46.333 --> 09:49.616
started working at Momsen's.

09:55.902 --> 10:01.167
Do people talk much about the battles that were 
fought near here? Well, no. I remember that my

10:03.529 --> 10:10.015
mother and father, we must have been living in 
south El Paso.

10:14.483 --> 10:33.150
Right there, along the river, we had American

10:14.483 --> 10:33.150
forces,

10:14.483 --> 10:33.150
you know, just guarding the river. But they tell me 
that they could hear the fighting in the water, and

10:34.091 --> 10:43.765
then a stray bullet would come across and hit 
somebody over here, just accidentally.

10:49.162 --> 10:57.273
Did

10:49.162 --> 10:57.273
your father or your mother ever talk about why he 
joined with B? I mean, did he believe he was

10:57.453 --> 10:59.977
fighting for anything? Believe in the 
revolution? Yes, he did. He did. My father used to

11:02.760 --> 11:05.664
tell me that. In fact, at first, you know, he 
thought it was the greatest thing that could have

11:05.684 --> 11:12.413
happened to Mexico.

11:15.117 --> 11:16.519
But as he got older, And the song was happening in 
Mexico. He used to say, put it this way. And

11:25.464 --> 11:31.952
then he'd say, you know, a word, you know. In other 
words, they fought the battles, but some other

11:32.693 --> 11:41.423
people came over and took over. They took credit 
for what they did, in other words. That's what he

11:44.567 --> 11:45.949
meant. that they fought for freedom, for 
democracy or whatever they call it then. But some

11:53.579 --> 11:57.906
other people came over and took over and it was the 
same old story again. Just one party rule. He

12:01.512 --> 12:04.056
didn't believe in that after that. He thought 
maybe there would be a freer elections and all

12:06.019 --> 12:11.548
that.

12:15.308 --> 12:30.684
But after so many years, he got a little, well, in 
fact,

12:15.308 --> 12:30.684
oh, he was already sick. He was, you could say, the 
last few years of his life. He was disappointed, in

12:35.729 --> 12:39.173
other words, with what had happened.

12:42.832 --> 12:47.342
Well, what, because of the one party, or...? Yes, 
because he used to say, somos mismos. He meant, you

12:53.735 --> 13:00.790
know, that nobody else had a chance to run against 
the... Well, what about land for the poor and some

13:02.592 --> 13:08.818
of the other idea, or land for the villages and some 
of the other ideas of the revolution? Did he ever

13:08.898 --> 13:10.319
talk about those? Yes, he liked the idea. In fact, 
he got a... That's how he got his land, or his land

13:11.701 --> 13:19.809
near south of the forest. I don't remember how he 
called it. Alaristas or something like that.

13:28.537 --> 13:29.098
Alaristas? Mm-hmm.

13:35.262 --> 13:54.336
But like I say,

13:35.262 --> 13:54.336
overall, he wasn't too proud that it was just a one 
party system in Mexico. He thought that Well, I

13:56.407 --> 14:15.008
guess after he was in the United States and so on, 
the way things were run, you know, he never voted or

13:56.407 --> 14:15.008
anything like that, but he used to, you know, sort 
of, he used to tell me it was sort of fair elections,

13:56.407 --> 14:15.008
in other words. Because in Mexico, a year ahead, 
you can know who's going to be elected. Mm-hmm. And

14:25.364 --> 14:28.327
he didn't like that idea at all.

14:32.751 --> 14:51.368
Well,

14:32.751 --> 14:51.368
what do you think about... Did he talk about life 
being any better in Mexico or the standard of

14:32.751 --> 14:51.368
living being higher or anything like that? No, he 
was disappointed. He was disappointed.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.762
The poor stayed poor. And only the, I guess you 
could call them the smart, got rich off of the poor.

15:06.830 --> 15:11.595
He

15:06.830 --> 15:11.595
was not for that. In fact, he wasn't a very well 
educated man, but he was smart. Like I tell my boys,

15:18.482 --> 15:23.367
I wish I hadn't had half the rings my father had 
because Anything he did, I mean, for instance, he

15:23.819 --> 15:27.487
was a cripple. And I remember, because I was just a 
youngster, he bought a car. And he couldn't drive

15:33.841 --> 15:38.631
it because of his disability. So he hired a man to 
drive for him. And one time, he couldn't get the

15:43.546 --> 15:52.398
man, or I don't know, he fired him or something like 
that, and he said, well, I'm going to drive the car.

15:53.039 --> 15:56.043
And my mom said, oh, you can't drive a car with that 
blade. I said, I'm going to drive it. So he made a

15:59.367 --> 16:04.273
contraction where he, you know, it was a driver 
car. And he was a very good driver. He was a very good

16:06.977 --> 16:07.978
driver. And at first, Something was going wrong 
with the car, so he hired a mechanic to fix it.

16:19.300 --> 16:22.865
Pretty soon, he said, well, I'm not going to pay 
anybody just to do that. So he started working on

16:23.105 --> 16:25.348
that car. He used to break it all down, tear it apart 
completely, and then assemble it again. And you

16:31.335 --> 16:33.397
know, I mean, I can't do it. I can tear things apart, 
but I can't put them together again. And he used

16:39.204 --> 16:40.806
to... do a mechanic job very well, carpentry work, 
build anything, you know, things like that, he was

16:41.343 --> 16:53.561
pretty capable. Did he ever talk about any of the 
battles or any of the things that he did while he was

16:53.581 --> 16:58.308
fighting for Villa? No, like I said before, he 
never did talk to me too much about when he was a

16:58.548 --> 17:06.760
soldier, about his life when he was a soldier.

17:10.334 --> 17:12.917
Did he ever talk with anybody else about it? I don't 
think so. I was just thinking that if I ever heard

17:13.718 --> 17:17.662
conversations with him. No? I don't remember him.

17:23.929 --> 17:24.930
I don't remember. You know what he liked to do when 
he was in the crowd, conversations, something

17:24.990 --> 17:33.539
like that? He used to learn a lot of poems. He used to 
recite, like to recite poems and sing. He used to

17:41.143 --> 17:43.286
play guitar and used to sing. Do you remember what 
songs he sang? Oh, a lot of those Pajarito

17:49.273 --> 17:57.323
Barranqueño, La Edita.

18:00.026 --> 18:05.232
He used to sing a lot about Mexico. I forget the 
names of the songs. I don't have a good memory of the

18:08.320 --> 18:11.525
names of the songs. They used to sing a lot. And in 
fact, my father, he was always a laughable party.

18:19.157 --> 18:26.629
In other words, he always got invited to parties 
because he'd carry his guitar with him and he'd

18:19.157 --> 18:26.629
always have him sing. He had a good voice. Or say 
poems and

18:28.191 --> 18:32.518
all. I think one poem that I never forgot, and it's a 
very small one. What is it? It's called En Esta Vida

18:41.532 --> 18:47.401
Es Y Sillanto, Los Hombres Andres Míos. Somos los 
locos que en romería vamos para el camposanto.

18:51.928 --> 18:53.089
Because it got a lot of meaning. Yes, it does. And 
that's the only one that I ever learned that I never

18:55.653 --> 18:58.397
forgot a meaning. But I used to say a lot of poems 
like that. long, and his favorite play was the Juan

19:02.063 --> 19:12.514
Tenorio. He used to act it out. In fact, in the 
party, you know, he'd get a cast of, he'd have a few

19:15.297 --> 19:27.970
beers, a few drinks, you know, get a broomstick, 
you know, and he'd act out the Juan Tenorio in the

19:15.297 --> 19:27.970
nest and all that. No, he was at that time. He had a 
very good memory, I mean, for him. He learned by

19:32.899 --> 19:34.681
himself. And he knew how to write when he was 
little. He knew how to write, read. Had he gone to

19:40.368 --> 19:41.590
school at all? Oh, I think he had about three years 
of school. He had about three years of school.

19:46.856 --> 19:48.318
Because that's what happened over there. They 
didn't even know how to write and read or nothing.

19:52.182 --> 19:54.685
But I was thinking about my father. Do you know how 
to write? Yeah, I know how to write. And your uncle,

19:57.532 --> 19:59.836
when he says, Lado? No.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.287
My family, they all did. You know how to write in 
Spanish and English. I see. Can you mention?

20:15.246 --> 20:19.434
What

20:15.246 --> 20:19.434
is this? Well, I guess it's a Nothing strange about 
it. The people, you know, during the frontier

20:24.159 --> 20:32.681
days, I mean, they didn't go to school, and still a 
lot of people were self-educated. That's right.
