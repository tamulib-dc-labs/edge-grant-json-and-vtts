00:02.039 --> 00:19.347
This

00:02.039 --> 00:19.347
is August the 10th and sitting in the Harrington 
Tower interviewing Dr. Brian Cole about his

00:02.039 --> 00:19.347
experiences here, first as a graduate student and 
then as a faculty member. Brian, introduce

00:19.968 --> 00:25.617
yourself to anyone who may listen or read the 
transcript of this tape. background where'd you

00:25.597 --> 00:40.635
grow up family high school education experience 
before you came to A&M okay I was I'm a native Texan

00:25.597 --> 00:40.635
born in Wichita Falls and Moved to Dallas for a 
couple of years and then started public schools in

00:41.982 --> 00:52.720
Marlin, Texas, just 60 miles north of College 
Station. And so I have fond childhood memories of

00:53.822 --> 01:01.054
A&M back during when it was its traditional self. 
And my dad was a football nut, literally. And I can

01:06.173 --> 01:19.668
remember as a child on those few occasions where 
there would be a noon game here that I would come

01:06.173 --> 01:19.668
down with my dad and we would go to the game here 
until about halftime. And then we would leave and

01:20.789 --> 01:31.682
drive to Waco for a three o'clock game at Waco and 
stay there till about halftime and then drive to

01:20.789 --> 01:31.682
Fort Worth or to Dallas to catch a TCU or SMU game 
that evening. Now that didn't happen a lot because

01:31.662 --> 01:41.356
of scheduling, but it kind of gives you a sense of my 
dad's love for football, and of course I enjoyed

01:31.662 --> 01:41.356
A&M at that time. Graduated from Marlin High 
School in 1962. Had the opportunity to be student

01:46.344 --> 01:55.557
body president there, and really enjoyed my 
school years there. Worked all through high

01:55.777 --> 01:58.902
school.

02:00.097 --> 02:09.749
I had the privilege of being appointed to West 
Point by then Congressman Pogue, who was chairman

02:00.097 --> 02:09.749
of the House Ag Committee. It was interesting 
because A&M had been one of the schools that I

02:10.931 --> 02:17.860
considered, but I didn't want to go there at the 
time because it was all male. Of course, West Point

02:18.821 --> 02:26.070
was all male, too, but had a little bit different 
flavor, so I went there. I had to work pretty hard to

02:26.050 --> 02:35.787
be successful academically there as well as 
otherwise, but it was a great experience. I had the

02:37.150 --> 02:41.798
honor of being commander of the company A-1 my 
senior year, which meant that as A-1, we always led

02:41.778 --> 02:53.836
all the parades and all the march-ons to the 
Army-Navy game and all that kind of stuff. So it was

02:53.856 --> 02:55.518
kind of neat. Marching in General MacArthur's 
funeral procession in New York City when he died.

03:07.115 --> 03:10.941
So just lots of opportunities, lots of leadership 
exposure And that famous speech that he made at

03:10.921 --> 03:14.184
West Point. Was the spring before I went in. It was 
May of 62. But it still had such an impact that when

03:19.029 --> 03:32.043
we got there as plebes that summer, upperclassmen 
were still talking about it, I mean, and with some

03:19.029 --> 03:32.043
emotion in their voice. So we knew that it was quite 
something to, and of course I've heard it a hundred

03:32.443 --> 03:39.831
times in different situations over time. Did West 
Point outfits have nicknames like Aggie outfits?

03:43.194 --> 03:44.415
Did A-1 have a nickname? Not really. Well, some 
did.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.243
But they were usually tied to the alphabet. But A-1 
did not have one. Most did not. Most did not.

03:59.550 --> 04:07.337
Graduated from West Point in 66 and was 
commissioned in the artillery at the time. I had

04:08.667 --> 04:20.044
the opportunity to go to airborne and ranger 
school, and then we went to Europe where I was

04:08.667 --> 04:20.044
stationed with a Hawk battery about 17 miles from 
the Czech border. And that was a really good

04:21.547 --> 04:31.502
experience, had a lot of great NCOs who educated me 
and learned me, as we might say. Spent a year there,

04:31.550 --> 04:45.475
then got reassigned to Bad Kreuznach, Germany, to 
the 8th Infantry Division, where I moved in and

04:31.550 --> 04:45.475
took over the, moved in the personnel realm and 
took over the personnel services division for

04:31.550 --> 04:45.475
the, for the infantry division. Was there about 
eight months and then got curtailed as most

04:46.923 --> 04:54.696
everyone else was during that time to come back to 
Vietnam Went to language school. So the Ferris

04:55.057 --> 05:11.766
School and then a year in Vietnam And then back for 
about six months at Fort Hood and then selected to

04:55.057 --> 05:11.766
come out of the service at that time and came back to 
graduate school, initially to go into public

05:12.995 --> 05:17.231
school administration. What year was this? This 
was 1970.

05:23.558 --> 05:37.052
Kind of serendipitous, or maybe that's not the 
correct word, but I came back from Vietnam in March

05:23.558 --> 05:37.052
of 70, and was on leave for a couple of weeks there 
until I reported into Fort Hood. So during that

05:37.152 --> 05:45.701
time, had come down to A&M to talk to the faculty 
here about my application and assistantship. And

05:45.901 --> 05:51.507
I came, and it just so happened that that was the 
week that Earl Rutter had died, And he was lying in

05:51.487 --> 06:03.198
state in the systems building and had an occasion 
to sort of get a flavor because of that, of the

05:51.487 --> 06:03.198
impact that General Rudder had had. Did you walk 
over? I actually went over and described.

06:07.582 --> 06:10.604
Feelings, sentiments that you experienced? 
Well, you could tell that there was a very distinct

06:10.624 --> 06:17.791
specialness. It was almost like almost like being 
in the Capitol building in Washington when

06:20.596 --> 06:27.667
someone of national stature is lying in state. 
Members of the Cadet Corps, from the different

06:29.410 --> 06:39.646
outfits, were standing around, much as they do in 
the Capitol building, from the different

06:29.410 --> 06:39.646
services. And each of the military departments 
were represented from the Cadet Corps. Of course,

06:46.837 --> 06:50.344
all the flags on campus were at half-mast. It was a 
very somber time. But you had a sense that

06:54.111 --> 07:02.247
something special was occurring.

07:03.239 --> 07:11.667
And then after I got out in August, we moved here in 
August of 1970. And you have children at this

07:11.887 --> 07:14.269
point? I had one son, and Keith at that time was two 
years old, and came back to begin master's work in

07:14.729 --> 07:24.799
educational administration. Now, why did you 
pick A&M instead of some other institution? Well,

07:28.362 --> 07:30.664
I had made application to A&M and to Baylor, We 
wanted to be close to home, and A&M

07:30.813 --> 07:39.145
offered me the graduate assistantship. And you 
thought at that time your career goal was? Was

07:42.210 --> 07:43.412
public school administration. And so I came back 
and began working on that. I had to complete my

07:48.159 --> 07:53.226
teacher certification at the time under the old 
Jamison Act. And I had like 60 hours in math and more

07:54.320 --> 08:04.597
than enough hours in physics, and so my teaching 
fields were math and physics. But I remember being

08:06.280 --> 08:14.995
in the fourth floor of the academic building, and 
I'd been four years since I'd done any, you know,

08:06.280 --> 08:14.995
real math. And Dr. Chewy for the math department 
was my prof, and it was an advanced calculus class

08:16.173 --> 08:23.508
that I really didn't need. I was just doing it for 
getting back. And he was one of these guys that

08:26.334 --> 08:31.785
would write with one hand and erase with the other. 
And, you know, there were all these young

08:33.571 --> 08:43.604
undergraduate, because it was not a 
graduate-level course, it was a 400-level

08:33.571 --> 08:43.604
course, and there was all these undergraduate 
kids just humming along, doing fine. And I knew

08:44.465 --> 08:50.013
that even though I was only about four or five years 
old of these kids, that something had transpired

08:44.465 --> 08:50.013
during that time. So... But we made it through. I 
see. Did you have to take Texas government? Oh,

08:58.343 --> 08:58.663
yes. That's part of the deal. Texas government and 
Texas history. Actually, I took the Texas

09:03.868 --> 09:10.035
government, but I tested out of the Texas history.

09:11.317 --> 09:21.988
But toward the end of that year, Dr.

09:11.317 --> 09:21.988
Frank Hubert, who was the dean of the College of 
Education at that time, for some reason... had

09:23.437 --> 09:48.482
noticed me or heard about me or whatever and just 
one day out of the clear blue in about April he calls

09:23.437 --> 09:48.482
me over to his office and of course you know I'm a 
little antsy about that because Dr. Hubert even

09:23.437 --> 09:48.482
then had a reputation Haskell as you are well aware 
so I go over and sit there and Dr. Hubert said You

09:48.462 --> 10:02.704
know, one of the things I've done over the years is 
to try to identify promising graduate students

09:48.462 --> 10:02.704
and to bring them into my office as assistant to the 
dean while they work on their doctorate. And I

10:04.366 --> 10:07.250
wondered if you might be interested in doing that. 
And this is your first year? This is about, this is

10:08.853 --> 10:10.796
the end of my first year. Now what was, what was 
your, describe your first impression of him as a

10:15.479 --> 10:17.966
person? Well, pretty intimidating.

10:25.306 --> 10:29.337
Someone that you knew was serious

10:30.987 --> 10:49.266
someone who had a tremendous intellect, someone 
who cared deeply about education, and someone

10:30.987 --> 10:49.266
who, by their very nature, you did not want to 
disappoint. and who instilled a lot of confidence

10:49.246 --> 11:02.426
by his expression of his confidence in you. Did you 
ever later learn who it was that helped him

11:03.087 --> 11:08.496
identify you? No, my guess is it would probably be 
Paul Hensarling. I was Paul's graduate

11:13.123 --> 11:14.545
assistant. And of course, Paul and Frank had had a 
long professional association. Describe Dr.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.993
Henseling and your work for him. OK. He was a rather 
unique guy. Dr. Henseling had been

11:26.857 --> 11:34.569
superintendent at Orange for some period of time. 
And I don't know exactly when he actually came to

11:35.791 --> 11:43.283
A&M, but he was one of the professors in the 
Department of Education Administration. And Dr.

11:44.917 --> 11:53.910
Hensheling had had a voice problem, a physical 
voice problem. At some point, I don't remember

11:54.991 --> 12:09.251
exactly when, but it caused him to talk rather low 
and with an airy kind of forced speech.

12:13.157 --> 12:14.839
But he didn't let that get in his way. And he was a guy 
that had very high expectations and basically

12:15.916 --> 12:27.918
would lay out, and these are the things I want you to 
do, and then, you know, you go forth and do. And had a

12:29.021 --> 12:37.857
pretty close relationship because we didn't have 
separate offices back then, and so I actually had a

12:29.021 --> 12:37.857
table right there in his office. Was he the 
chairman? No, Hal Hawkins was the chair at that

12:40.595 --> 12:43.078
time. Other faculty members were Les Richardson,

12:44.199 --> 12:57.094
Tim Stennett, and it was a fairly small 
department, and Hal.

13:00.518 --> 13:03.582
But Dr. Henshling was the senior man in years? Yes, 
yes, yes. And your duties for him? Doing research,

13:07.925 --> 13:15.377
some background publication work. He was working 
primarily in the area of school services, support

13:15.938 --> 13:33.207
services, auxiliary services we might call them, 
and annually updated a sort of a series of readings

13:15.938 --> 13:33.207
and texts, so I did some work on that. One of my big 
responsibilities was to do all the logistical

13:33.187 --> 13:52.495
preparation for the administrative leadership, 
what we called the June Conference back then,

13:33.187 --> 13:52.495
which was an annual conference for school 
administrators from all over the state, mostly

13:33.187 --> 13:52.495
superintendents and a few principals. And we'd 
have 400 or 500 folks come in for that. And had a big

13:55.978 --> 13:57.479
reputation. Over the years, it had developed sort 
of a traditional history of typical things that

13:58.320 --> 14:03.645
would go on. And so it was as much a fellowship time 
for school administrators as it was for

14:03.665 --> 14:09.590
professional development. And so I did all the 
logistics work for that. For Dr. Hensley? For Dr.

14:14.214 --> 14:15.275
Hensley, yes. In that first year? In that first 
year, right. That was quite a bit of time devoted

14:18.458 --> 14:22.161
toward that activity. And so then in the spring of 
that first year, you have this conversation with

14:22.613 --> 14:33.450
Dr. Hubert, and then follow next what, he gives you 
an assignment? Well, he asked me first if I wanted

14:33.750 --> 14:41.743
to do it, and he said the plan would be, he said Jerry 
Vinson at the time was the assistant to the dean.

14:42.764 --> 14:45.128
And Jerry was about a year out from finishing. And 
Dr. Hewitt said, if you're interested, what I'd

14:45.108 --> 14:57.288
like to do is, beginning in September, is for you to 
come over and be a graduate assistant and sort of

14:45.108 --> 14:57.288
understudy Jerry. And then when he graduates 
summer of 72, then if everything works out, then

14:58.310 --> 15:07.645
you'd become assistant. Do you remember what the 
compensation was? Well, as a GA, it was about, I

15:10.150 --> 15:20.093
have a later interesting story about that, but as a 
GA, it was about three and a quarter a month, I

15:10.150 --> 15:20.093
think, as I recall. And what were you and your 
family living on? Well, that, plus I had the GI

15:23.140 --> 15:25.425
Bill. Oh, I forgot, sure. Plus, my wife was working 
as a teacher's aide at Snook. And just as an

15:32.244 --> 15:41.238
interesting aside, one of her also duties was to 
sponsor the pep squad at Snook. And, of course,

15:41.258 --> 15:50.233
this was back in the early 70s during their heyday 
of being the Class B basketball powerhouse in the

15:41.258 --> 15:50.233
state. Mm-hmm. And I can remember on more than one 
occasion of driving over to Austin to watch the

15:50.954 --> 15:59.406
state finals, one in particular.

16:02.130 --> 16:12.304
Coincidentally, Phil Graham's first wife was a 
teacher for whom my wife was an aide, Sherry

16:02.130 --> 16:12.304
Graham. And I can remember the state finals at 
Gregory Gym at UT, and Phil was right in front of me.

16:22.641 --> 16:27.007
And, of course, this was early 70s when he was like 
an assistant professor of economics. And suffice

16:28.709 --> 16:37.279
it to say that Phil got into the game.

16:37.259 --> 16:39.062
I mean, I had two shows going on. One was the game and 
one was Phil. Because if the ref made any call

16:41.605 --> 16:49.477
whatsoever that he felt was inappropriate, I 
mean, he was right in their face. It was pretty

16:50.719 --> 16:53.663
interesting, you know. Let me turn this off. All 
right. And so you began then? Began that fall. Now,

17:02.794 --> 17:04.757
meanwhile, you're taking a full course load. One 
other thing, I remained active in the Army

17:04.958 --> 17:08.884
Reserve. And that played a rather important role 
then throughout the rest of my time. Describe that

17:15.255 --> 17:17.839
first year or two. What was a typical week? What all 
were you doing? Well, taking how many hours? In

17:25.350 --> 17:34.384
that fall, in that fall I was taking 12 hours, more 
than a full load. I was working 20 hours a week as a

17:35.085 --> 17:39.531
graduate assistant. My wife was working full 
time, plus we were juggling our young son, because

17:39.511 --> 18:01.831
again, in the later fall, when basketball season 
really began, and she had to go to the pep squad,

17:39.511 --> 18:01.831
sometimes it was one or two o'clock in the morning 
before they got back in, so I'd have to go and wake

17:39.511 --> 18:01.831
Keith up and go out and get all that kind of stuff. 
And then, at least once a month, I was doing a

18:02.752 --> 18:09.518
weekend for the reserve. And where were you all 
living? We were living in the Bryan Orms

18:13.027 --> 18:19.324
apartments down on South College for our first 
year. Do you remember what the rent was?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.525
I try to put in things like this as a kind of a 
barometer. No, but I can give you another

18:26.545 --> 18:28.107
barometer. Okay. Because after that first year, 
and we, I made the decision then, let me back up,

18:31.051 --> 18:51.300
because when Dr. Hubert asked me if I wanted to 
become his assistant dean, at that time,

18:31.051 --> 18:51.300
professionally, I really had to decide did I want 
to stay public school or go higher ed. I had

18:51.280 --> 18:58.890
realized during the course of that first year that 
I really felt like I might be able to contribute

18:51.280 --> 18:58.890
better in higher ed than in public school. So it 
helped make that decision. But once we decided to

19:02.394 --> 19:14.310
stay, then, and with Keith growing up, we decided, 
well, if we're going to be here four years, we need

19:02.394 --> 19:14.310
to try to find the little house. And so in the

19:22.212 --> 19:26.826
Let's see, I guess it was around January. Yeah, it 
was during the Christmas break of my first year

19:26.866 --> 19:31.902
with Dr. Huber. that we seriously began looking 
for a little house. We found a little house over on

19:35.942 --> 19:40.948
Eagle Pass, which is off of Texas. And there's a 
wonderful little two-bedroom house built in

19:42.329 --> 19:47.975
1933. And the lady who lived in it was Mrs. Schmidt. 
And her husband, back in the 40s, had been the dean

19:52.641 --> 19:58.227
of the vet school. And she was a wonderful, 
wonderful lady. And we really enjoyed visiting

20:04.114 --> 20:06.376
her. And even after we bought her place, 
frequently, about every Sunday afternoon for

20:06.436 --> 20:16.827
several months, she would drive by and stop in for a 
few minutes. And of course, we welcomed to have

20:16.907 --> 20:18.829
her. But it was a wonderful little place to be a 
young graduate student and so forth. What was the

20:23.193 --> 20:24.134
price on that? Well, that was what I was going to 
tell you. The price of the house was $17,000. And

20:30.100 --> 20:45.724
Wanda, my wife, to this day, uh, kids me about 
remembering when we signed those papers that I was

20:30.100 --> 20:45.724
literally white as a sheet obligating myself to 
that kind of, uh, debt, you know. Uh, and, uh, so it

20:45.744 --> 20:49.270
was a great little place. It had a nice backyard. It 
was a nice neighborhood during the time, nice

20:51.313 --> 20:54.678
neighbors and, and so forth. But, uh, so it was uh it 
was doing all those things of you know family and

20:57.623 --> 21:21.488
school and working and reserve and all that uh so 
you began with dr hubert then in the fall of fall of

20:57.623 --> 21:21.488
uh 71 71 and also another graduate assistant in the 
office at that time was barry thompson who

21:23.003 --> 21:26.390
subsequently became, obviously, chancellor of 
the A&M system. And Barry was also, Hubert had

21:27.292 --> 21:33.265
worked out a deal with Barry. He was doing his 
residency, and so he was a graduate assistant, but

21:33.285 --> 21:42.244
he was also at least part-time superintending at 
Waco ISD at that time. And so Barry and I developed,

21:43.372 --> 21:53.394
began the development there of a lifetime 
friendship and professional association, which

21:43.372 --> 21:53.394
has been very good all these years. And so as it 
turned out, Jerry Vincent, who was the assistant

21:54.696 --> 22:03.355
to the dean, Got

22:03.335 --> 22:16.508
a job offer prematurely, it's not really 
premature, unexpectedly, to be the director of

22:03.335 --> 22:16.508
the Mahea State School. Well, he was ABD at that 
point. Man, I don't know, I was not privy to exactly

22:20.352 --> 22:28.060
what Hubert suggested to him, but Jerry decided to 
take that. which meant that he was leaving toward

22:29.423 --> 22:33.250
the end of January of 73. No, 72, yeah,

22:33.270 --> 22:50.183
because I started in the fall of 71, which sort of 
upped my ante on moving into the assistant to the

22:33.270 --> 22:50.183
dean thing. Well, my very first assignment as 
assistant to the dean was, Hubert had, and I'd been

22:50.382 --> 23:08.890
working on it somewhat, but Hubert had planned a 
faculty retreat at the flagship hotel in

22:50.382 --> 23:08.890
Galveston. And so my responsibility was to lay all 
that on. And I remember John Calhoun was invited

23:15.188 --> 23:24.693
down, and Dick , they came down as a part of that for 
presentations and so forth. It was about a

23:24.773 --> 23:30.649
three-day retreat.

23:31.675 --> 23:37.001
And I was just in the process of sort of moving into 
the assistant to the dean role at that time. And I

23:38.283 --> 23:58.527
remember prior to going down there, Dr. Hubert had 
discussed with me that I would start at $8,100

23:38.283 --> 23:58.527
working full-time as assistant to the dean, 
which, you know, compared to 300 bucks a month,

23:38.283 --> 23:58.527
that's pretty good stuff. This will give you some 
flavor of Dr. Hubert. Coming back after we'd come

24:06.500 --> 24:17.106
back from that conference, and I have another 
story to tell you about that in a minute, but coming

24:06.500 --> 24:17.106
back from that, after we got back, Dr. Hubert 
called me in and said, Brian, He said, I want to tell

24:18.638 --> 24:22.582
you, that was the best conference that I've ever 
had. And he said, I attribute that to your work. He

24:27.327 --> 24:31.691
said, it was flawless, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, 
dah. And he said, what I'm going to do is we're going

24:31.711 --> 24:36.116
to raise your starting salary to $9,000. Wow. I 
thought, yeah, all right. So

24:41.462 --> 24:47.768
that was a nice little deal right off the bat. And 
the aside story I want to tell you, in driving back

24:48.710 --> 24:59.085
from Galveston after that conference, I was 
riding with Dr. Hubert. And he had a Willie Nelson

25:00.507 --> 25:04.814
tape in the radio. And Willie was singing 
Michelle. And Dr. Hubert got this very nostalgic

25:11.344 --> 25:16.371
look on his face. And after it was over, I said, Dr. 
Hubert, I said, that song seemed to mean something

25:18.055 --> 25:24.303
to you. He said, well, let me tell you. He said, back 
when I was at UT, I was working and going to school

25:27.347 --> 25:34.396
and all this. And he said, a friend of mine 
approached me that they were putting a band

25:35.497 --> 25:47.472
together for the summer to play on a cruise ship to 
go to Europe. And he said he won't know if I want to

25:49.342 --> 25:55.155
try out for the band. So I thought about it and said, 
well, yeah, I guess I will. And of course, he was

26:01.009 --> 26:04.798
primarily a woodwind person at that point. And so 
he tried out for the band, but he didn't get it. But

26:10.385 --> 26:20.343
about a week before the band left, I think it was the 
trumpet or cornet player got sick and couldn't go

26:10.385 --> 26:20.343
or what have you. So his friend came to him and said, 
Hubert, can you play cornet? He says, well, nobody

26:27.656 --> 26:29.760
can learn. And so, in the space of a week, Dr. Hubert 
went to a pawn shop,

26:31.141 --> 26:48.306
got somebody's horn out of pawn, taught himself 
how to play the trumpet, and then played in that

26:31.141 --> 26:48.306
band on the cruise ship over. They had some time in 
France while they were there, and while they were

26:49.287 --> 26:56.237
in France, he met a Michelle. whom he obviously had 
some very fond memories about. That's as far as I

27:03.216 --> 27:04.197
know. I had not heard that part of it before. But 
then they then play on the way back. They get back,

27:10.766 --> 27:21.239
and because of his financial straitness at the 
time, he then takes the horn back to that pawn shop

27:10.766 --> 27:21.239
and gets his money back. I think that's a great 
story. Oh, yes. When you... Started out did he

27:28.955 --> 27:35.662
describe your duties and how well did his 
description match the realities? You were to be

27:37.503 --> 27:54.220
the assistant for what yeah basically for budgets 
administration Contracting grant activity we

27:37.503 --> 27:54.220
had at the time One two three four five five 
secretaries in the dean's office. They all

28:01.602 --> 28:02.603
reported to me. In other words, I was sort of the 
office manager as well as, and then I was

28:02.623 --> 28:20.743
responsible for the college budgets and the 
administration of all of that, the

28:02.623 --> 28:20.743
administration of all the contracting grant 
accounts, all personnel actions, those kinds of

28:02.623 --> 28:20.743
things. Physically, y'all were located? 
Physically, we were in the west end of the academic

28:23.005 --> 28:39.918
library, the old library, on the first floor, 
where they've now remodeled all that that looks so

28:23.005 --> 28:39.918
nice. Oh, in Cushing. Cushing, yeah, west end of 
Cushing, right on the first floor there. And the

28:45.348 --> 28:49.676
College of Education? The dean's office. Dean's 
office. That's all that was there. Yeah. Who were

28:53.043 --> 28:55.808
the other professionals? Lannis Hope was the 
associate dean for student affairs and Don Clark

28:56.649 --> 29:04.945
was the associate dean for research. Describe 
them and their their characteristics and their

29:06.712 --> 29:08.679
manner of. Well, Landis was an educational 
psychologist. He was a very interesting

29:11.628 --> 29:13.916
gentleman. Extremely well read. I think I must 
have read four books a week of all genre. But at the

29:24.240 --> 29:30.426
time in the college, we had, I'll have to go back in a 
minute. At the time in the college, we had maybe a

29:31.247 --> 29:35.150
few hundred students. And so as associate dean for 
students, it was not a huge job, but he had other

29:36.251 --> 29:41.956
responsibilities. I think it was a half-time 
appointment. And then he was a half-time with the

29:43.197 --> 29:47.181
Ed Psych faculty. But very sensitive, very much 
what you think of as a counselor type individual.

29:56.560 --> 30:04.091
had had some interesting World War II experiences 
and sort of relived those on occasion. Don Clark

30:05.192 --> 30:17.910
had come to A&M from the Midwest and had done work at 
Stout, I think.

30:21.130 --> 30:23.715
I don't remember where his doctorate is from, but 
somewhere in the Midwest. And Don had been fairly

30:24.777 --> 30:34.255
active in the contracting grant work, and so his 
role was primarily helping faculty through

30:24.777 --> 30:34.255
research and graduate programs. Of course, it was 
a new, growing entity. Now the key staff, the chief

30:37.972 --> 30:42.681
of the staff was Peggy Ritchie? Yes. Describe 
Peggy. Well, Peggy was what one might think of when

30:44.965 --> 30:53.280
thinking of a a woman who's been in an office for a 
long period of time, who knows her job backwards,

30:53.260 --> 31:14.998
forwards, and sideways, who has a wealth of 
information, and who people would go to with some

30:53.260 --> 31:14.998
regularity on a whole variety of issues.
