WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:15.646
We loaded every possession that we had in our car in 
the smallest little U-Haul trailer that you can

00:03.068 --> 00:15.646
rent and drove to Auburn, Alabama. And we did have 
an apartment ready, so we knew where we were going

00:17.088 --> 00:21.835
to rent. So that was a true experience. At that 
point, was Pierre Matty, was he kind of a role model

00:26.086 --> 00:36.897
for you as a scholar-scientist? Absolutely. He 
was clearly a role model, both as a professional.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.328
He had the professional demeanor, the 
professional dress. But he was also a premier

00:49.871 --> 00:52.954
surgeon. And, yeah, he was the role model, no 
question. And what did Dean Price say when you

00:59.143 --> 01:02.647
chatted with him? It was very encouraging, and I 
had gotten to know Dean Price quite well because I

01:02.667 --> 01:19.988
was president of my class in the veterinary 
college, so periodically I met with him for

01:02.667 --> 01:19.988
various issues, and then I was president of the 
student body and the American Veterinary Medical

01:21.858 --> 01:37.512
Association student chapter actually got to go to 
Portland, Oregon on the same plane with him to the

01:21.858 --> 01:37.512
national meeting of the American Veterinary 
Medical Association. So I had gotten to know him

01:37.552 --> 01:50.624
and had been in such leadership roles in the 
veterinary college that he was more than just the

01:37.552 --> 01:50.624
dean of the college. By then we had a personal 
relationship, and he was very encouraging. All

01:57.732 --> 01:59.775
right, let's stay with him just a second. Both then 
and later, describe as much as you can about Al

02:00.656 --> 02:05.641
Price. Al Price was a visionary leader who was able 
to make tough decisions and who was, I believe, a

02:18.946 --> 02:24.093
tremendous communicator with the faculty and the 
students. And he was a person, you knew where he

02:25.876 --> 02:29.241
stood. You knew what his standards were. And he 
implemented some pretty tough changes in going

02:33.467 --> 02:44.282
from the four year to the three year year round.

02:47.226 --> 02:48.328
And he was a role model. And there was no question. 
And there was no question who was the dean of the

02:50.809 --> 02:52.932
college. And there was no question but what the 
highest standards of character and integrity

02:53.753 --> 02:59.502
would be upheld. And if you didn't uphold those as a 
student, you wouldn't be there. And we held the

03:05.631 --> 03:15.344
students and we held ourselves to such an 
incredibly high standard. If any student was

03:16.206 --> 03:19.210
caught cheating in the College of Veterinary 
Medicine, It was goodbye, and there was no second

03:20.152 --> 03:24.137
chance, and people knew that. And as far as you all 
knew, Price was around a lot. You saw him. You saw

03:31.788 --> 03:34.411
him a great deal, absolutely. Never heard 
anything negative about him? No, not always. He

03:38.757 --> 03:43.824
was a gentleman, treated students and faculty 
with a great respect. And as far as I was aware,

03:47.388 --> 04:05.053
although veterinary medicine numerically, its 
student body wasn't large compared to the rest of

03:47.388 --> 04:05.053
it, that his image with the central 
administration of the campus was such that

03:47.388 --> 04:05.053
veterinary medicine was certainly treated 
equally fairly in every manner. And I think that

04:05.374 --> 04:16.129
was generally felt by the faculty that we 
interacted with, and I think it was generally felt

04:05.374 --> 04:16.129
by the veterinary students because there was such 
a pride of

04:17.932 --> 04:24.601
being selected to be in the class. And you didn't 
want to let anyone down. And there was a standard

04:27.484 --> 04:43.685
there, which I think is really the Aggie code of 
honor, that you didn't want to be the one that might

04:27.484 --> 04:43.685
not have upheld

04:27.484 --> 04:43.685
it. When did a veterinary student buy a senior 
ring? Well, back then, since there was no

04:47.665 --> 05:10.472
undergraduate degree program per se, after the 
second trimester of your second year in

04:47.665 --> 05:10.472
veterinary college, which would be December, you 
would be given a baccalaureate degree. It was a BS

05:10.692 --> 05:14.837
in veterinary science. So once you're going 
through that process of the two years and then your

05:17.467 --> 05:46.122
first year in when you got the adequate number of 
hours you could go get your senior ring and that was

05:17.467 --> 05:46.122
one of the greatest days of my life and I remember 
distinctly then you picked them up in Eaton Hall

05:17.467 --> 05:46.122
and I can remember as if it were yesterday of 
walking up to the second floor walking up those

05:17.467 --> 05:46.122
stairs and it was on the left when you got to the top 
of the stairs walking in there and picking up that

05:17.467 --> 05:46.122
ring and putting it on. Do you remember what it 
cost? It was something like $28 or $58. It was small

05:50.813 --> 05:53.376
back then. Do you have any Aggie Ring stories, 
anecdotes? Have you ever lost it? I've never lost

05:58.382 --> 05:59.303
it. The only time that I really remember was after I 
was at Auburn. My wife and I were going to be

06:05.591 --> 06:11.678
sponsors for a group of veterinary students to go 
to Panama City, Florida. And we were leaving, and

06:12.640 --> 06:15.864
she looked at me, and she said, where's your Aggie 
Ring? And I said, oh. But I also looked at the other

06:18.149 --> 06:21.613
hand, and my wedding band wasn't there either. And 
what had happened was I had done surgery that day,

06:22.474 --> 06:28.921
and when I scrubbed, I'd left them in my clinic 
jacket. So we drove all the way back to the small

06:28.941 --> 06:34.547
animal clinic, and I got my Aggie ring and my 
wedding band at the same time. Have you ever been at

06:35.688 --> 06:39.733
some unusual place and somebody wrecked it? Oh, 
yeah. Where? We went later. My wife and I and our two

06:43.917 --> 06:47.481
daughters, when they were both... up in high 
school to Los Angeles and they wanted to go to

06:47.798 --> 06:56.248
Hollywood and the movie studios and some things 
there. And I was at the airport at a car rental

06:56.888 --> 07:08.061
agency checking the car in and I look over next to me 
and here's this guy filling out his papers with an

06:56.888 --> 07:08.061
Aggie ring. I immediately whip out to him and he was 
from Minnesota, now living in Minnesota. So we

07:14.709 --> 07:16.150
whipped out to each other. So it's the calling card 
around the world. Describe commencement, vet

07:20.096 --> 07:23.300
school commencement. Vet school commencement 
was held in Bryan Civic Auditorium and of course

07:24.842 --> 07:43.002
that was a small group and that seats about 1,500 so 
it was adequate size for us and all of our family and

07:24.842 --> 07:43.002
Charlie Scruggs I remember is the who gave the 
commencement. You know most of the time you don't

07:43.703 --> 07:47.387
remember who spoke at commencement but I do 
remember him. And of course, it was such a special

07:48.025 --> 07:59.939
time because not only had no one in either side of my 
family ever gone to college, but here was the first

07:48.025 --> 07:59.939
one now getting a doctor's degree. So special 
because not only did you receive the doctoral

08:01.461 --> 08:14.877
role, but they hooded you on stage and then 
pronounced you doctor of veterinary medicine.

08:15.667 --> 08:30.447
And I could just look at my mom and dad and just see 
them beaming with such pride because my dad had

08:15.667 --> 08:30.447
been offered a scholarship, academic, to A&M, but 
World War II caught him. And when he got back, then

08:31.448 --> 08:37.096
he had a wife and me, and he could never financially 
go. So it meant so much to him. And it was an

08:41.873 --> 08:44.980
emotional time, it really was. And Kathy, my 
wife's family was there. It was a celebration.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.739
About how many of those 64 graduated? I believe 
that we ended with 62 out of the 64. Wow. That's

08:58.890 --> 09:00.574
better than usual, isn't it? Oh, yeah. Let's see. 
Korean veterans were already gone. They were

09:07.743 --> 09:08.524
gone. Although there were probably a few in our 
class that were older and had come back. And

09:16.012 --> 09:18.315
Vietnam was not yet. It was just beginning. It 
hadn't produced any. No. I'll tell you something

09:24.001 --> 09:25.863
interesting. We're talking about that time 
frame. It's like when I started dating Kathy. for

09:31.334 --> 09:40.683
her to come over from the University of Texas or 
when she came up from Corpus, the greatest

09:31.334 --> 09:40.683
challenge was to find a place for her to stay. Of 
course, we couldn't afford her to stay in a motel or

09:41.884 --> 09:45.688
hotel. Plus, there were only about three or four in 
the whole town. So you know what we did? We found a

09:49.972 --> 09:52.475
friend that we knew, somebody at church.

09:56.158 --> 10:01.003
Or what was good was a number of classmates that 
were married. And a lot of times we'd say, hey, you

10:01.253 --> 10:06.962
live out, you've got a house, could she stay over 
there? And then when we lived out at Welburn, there

10:07.463 --> 10:20.443
was a girl out there named Alexander, and a lady 
probably in her late 70s lived alone, and she let

10:07.463 --> 10:20.443
her stay out there. That's a great challenge, I 
think. Yes, it is. If you're going to speak out of

10:25.571 --> 10:29.657
town, what would you do?

11:00.586 --> 11:11.397
The

11:00.586 --> 11:11.397
center pole of this campus. And I believe today. In 
fact, I will tell you later.

11:22.549 --> 11:30.137
But that was one.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.575
I'm going to tell you one that's funny. I'm on the 
great side.

11:46.957 --> 11:50.623
Oh, yes.

11:52.679 --> 11:56.747
Growing up, that was the campus site. And then 
college, most of the time, we would try to take them

11:57.649 --> 12:06.267
to see that part, because that was impressive back 
in its day. the facilities today, it's just an

12:06.905 --> 12:10.509
incredible medical facility. All right, now you 
got to Auburn in August of 66? That's September

12:15.274 --> 12:21.621
of 66, that's correct. And you were there how long? 
I was there almost three years. All right,

12:25.065 --> 12:26.066
describe that. What did you do there? That was an 
interesting experience for me because I

12:28.489 --> 12:35.477
graduated on August the 5th, and started work 
there August the 15th. And they were short a small

12:39.147 --> 12:42.952
animal surgeon. And here I am supposedly doing 
research and doing my graduate work thrown into

12:42.972 --> 12:56.408
the full responsibilities of a faculty member 
teaching surgery to fourth year veterinary

12:42.972 --> 12:56.408
students. And many of them had had four years of 
undergrad and now they were in their fourth year.

13:01.554 --> 13:03.456
So they had eight years of college And here I'd only 
had a total of five. Most of them were older than me.

13:08.957 --> 13:11.960
And I had not done some of the procedures. So I'd go 
bone up at night or at noon hour. And man, I was

13:15.743 --> 13:17.225
bummed. I'd just go right in there and do the 
surgery. And I was teaching surgery to a lot of them

13:19.867 --> 13:24.411
much older than me. And then taking graduate 
classes. The post-doctoral work. was a combined

13:31.263 --> 13:43.739
residency and post-doctoral master's program 
with a thesis in research in surgery and

13:31.263 --> 13:43.739
neurophysiology. So through the day, I would be 
working full time in the veterinary teaching

13:43.759 --> 13:52.470
hospital and taking graduate courses. And I'm not 
sure I would recommend it. That was tough. The

13:56.576 --> 13:57.737
hours were long. And plus, I had emergency duty. So 
those were full days. Compare Auburn to College

14:03.190 --> 14:09.938
Station and compare Auburn University to Texas 
A&M at that time. Auburn was probably at that time a

14:10.218 --> 14:16.105
comparable sized university because that was 
really before the big growth spurt. My last year in

14:17.067 --> 14:23.915
veterinary college was when A&M started its 
growth because it admitted women. Auburn was

14:23.935 --> 14:26.818
probably 12,000. and a good university, but it was 
clearly not Texas. It struggled with funding, but

14:34.183 --> 14:46.680
later down my academic career, it was good for me to 
see the tightening of belts from an

14:34.183 --> 14:46.680
administrative standpoint. The academic 
programs there in the veterinary college were

14:47.420 --> 14:51.324
very strong. I don't believe probably the whole 
university had the academic statue of an A&M, but

14:52.866 --> 15:04.998
particularly in the area or the discipline that I 
was in, it was the number one in the country. And

15:05.018 --> 15:11.765
they had some extremely talented, brilliant 
people in those areas. And I followed an Aggie. in

15:14.572 --> 15:27.490
the position that I took, who then went to the 
University of Minnesota College of Veterinary

15:14.572 --> 15:27.490
Medicine and has been head of the small animal 
department at the University of Georgia now for

15:14.572 --> 15:27.490
20, 30 years. As you made your way into the inner 
circle there, how did they treat Aggies? What was

15:35.742 --> 15:37.444
their impression of what they did? They loved 
Aggies because they knew Aggies were well trained

15:37.464 --> 15:42.351
and they knew Aggies were hard workers. And 
fortunately, I'd had a number of Aggies go through

15:42.787 --> 15:47.392
there before I was there. And quite frankly, I 
really believe they would give preference to an

15:48.433 --> 16:01.508
Aggie coming because they knew the kind of 
background we had and they knew our work ethic. And

16:01.528 --> 16:04.411
they always joked with us about being from Texas. I 
never got into hearing the Aggie joke. of

16:09.905 --> 16:12.207
everything so big in Texas. And I'll never forget 
when I told them that I was leaving, that I had

16:12.968 --> 16:29.643
accepted a faculty position back at A&M, one of the 
premier small anal orthopedic surgeons told me,

16:12.968 --> 16:29.643
he said, you know, I've always heard that an Aggie 
always goes back home to die. Now your wife, did she

16:32.265 --> 16:34.927
do any teaching over there? She taught public 
school. Okay.

16:47.907 --> 16:51.992
Was it, were newcomers well accepted in the 
community? We were very well accepted. And, you

16:53.875 --> 16:59.943
know, there was a lot of the southern hospitality,

16:53.875 --> 16:59.943
people there. We got very active in our church and 
immediately formed friends. We started working

17:08.173 --> 17:11.738
with college kids in our church. And we had a circle 
of about five couples, most of whom were either our

17:12.410 --> 17:21.198
age or a little older, and they just took us in and 
supported us fully. And then we were so fortunate

17:21.218 --> 17:37.712
in that the department head and his wife almost 
took a mentorship responsibility of us young

17:21.218 --> 17:37.712
faculty members, research associates. And I 
recall so many times they'd have us in the...

17:45.265 --> 17:49.032
Compared Auburn Southern Baptist to Texas 
Southern Baptist? Virtually no difference.

17:51.476 --> 17:52.718
Virtually no difference. And you, all three 
years, you're a, over there, you're working on the

17:52.738 --> 18:01.934
Ph.D.? I was for about the first two and a half, and 
then I stayed on. They were on a quarter system. I

18:11.676 --> 18:21.629
stayed on for another quarter as assistant 
professor before I took a position here in March of

18:11.676 --> 18:21.629
1969.

18:22.591 --> 18:32.784
What significant

18:22.591 --> 18:32.784
skills or attitudes or qualities do you think you 
acquired as a result of the Auburn experience?

18:32.804 --> 18:35.488
Well, there was no question but what I learned.

18:38.658 --> 18:39.359
research. I learned how to conduct research.

18:44.346 --> 19:06.555
I had the opportunity to develop surgical skills 
simply because of the practice of those that I got

18:44.346 --> 19:06.555
to apply there that really requires that kind of 
repetition to do on day in and day out and with the

18:44.346 --> 19:06.555
differences in the cases that you've dealt with. 
I'll never forget that we always said, okay, who's

19:07.666 --> 19:20.642
going to hold the record for doing the most spinal 
neuro procedures in one week? And when I left, I

19:20.662 --> 19:22.324
held the record. I did 17 one week. So that builds up 
because we had referral cases from all over the

19:24.767 --> 19:32.256
southeast. because at that time there were not 
veterinary colleges in the other southeastern

19:32.827 --> 19:37.033
states. And many times they drove in there from, we 
had cases from Canada even come in there. And so I

19:43.602 --> 19:53.275
gained that kind of experience just of the 
surgical skills technique as well as the graduate

19:43.602 --> 19:53.275
courses were rigorous. And I learned so much more 
of the in-depth neurophysiology surgery just the

20:01.531 --> 20:04.616
academic arena. I also had the privilege of giving 
some lectures and classes, so that gave me some

20:04.636 --> 20:11.726
teaching experience. And I learned a lot of people 
skills because when you deal with a clientele and

20:13.669 --> 20:30.154
you deal with the public and you have an emotional 
pet in front of you, between you, you're gonna

20:13.669 --> 20:30.154
quickly develop some people skills and 
communication skills. Fortunately, I had one of

20:31.383 --> 20:39.072
the very best administrators I have ever seen in my 
life as a role model before me. And I watched him

20:39.092 --> 20:44.819
because I had such an interest in leadership, 
which I had had since the sixth or seventh grade. So

20:45.780 --> 20:52.808
I was already beginning to think toward the future 
of leadership, of administration, and

20:45.780 --> 20:52.808
education. So I watched him, and I learned from 
him. And he was like Another administrator that I

20:57.573 --> 21:04.620
worked closely with, he was another one of those 
clean desk people, which I am too. When I walk out of

21:05.020 --> 21:09.365
my office in an afternoon, there won't be a single 
piece of paper on that desk. And there wasn't when I

21:09.825 --> 21:13.429
was provost or president of this university. I 
handled them. Now the Auburn Vet School in its size

21:15.851 --> 21:21.317
complexity was similar to the one here? Yes, 
almost identical in size. And it had students from

21:25.788 --> 21:28.692
a number of the southeastern states? It had 
students from seven different states. Under

21:31.276 --> 21:32.358
contract? Under contract. And I think they were 
taking, by that time, about 80 students. We had

21:40.070 --> 21:47.762
students from Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, 
Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee as a diverse

21:48.569 --> 21:52.595
group. In terms of student quality? Extremely 
high. It was comparable to here. Because a lot of

22:00.348 --> 22:07.279
those, since they took from seven states, those 
seven states could only send a contractual

22:00.348 --> 22:07.279
number. Boy, those kids were really selected out. 
They were cream of the crop. I know nothing about

22:13.679 --> 22:32.869
this and we don't need to spend much time on it, but I 
used to wonder about what the political realities

22:13.679 --> 22:32.869
might have been in the selection of that very 
minute number from various states, what strings

22:13.679 --> 22:32.869
may have been pulled or someone tried to pull to 
ensure that And they often tried to pull strings.

22:35.572 --> 22:37.994
They even get governor's offices in those states. 
That's what I would guess. The university was a lot

22:38.935 --> 22:40.457
like A&M. The student had to stand up on their own 
merit. And so how did you find out about the

22:45.541 --> 22:51.747
possibility of a return slot here? Well, that's 
interesting because even when I had left A&M, I had

22:51.967 --> 23:00.935
talked to the people in medicine and surgery. They 
knew what I was going to be doing.

23:09.198 --> 23:10.900
going on for post-doctoral work. So they were .

23:18.066 --> 23:25.833
I knew that they did not have anyone here in the 
specialty of neurosurgery, and they desperately

23:18.066 --> 23:25.833
needed it. So about the time that I had finished all 
my post-doctoral work, I get a call from the head of

23:26.874 --> 23:37.804
medicine and surgery here. indicating that they 
were going to have a position as an assistant

23:38.290 --> 23:43.276
professor opening up. And would I be interested? 
Well, with families and this being my alma mater,

23:45.779 --> 23:52.388
being an Aggie, they didn't even need to ask me. I 
was very quick to say, I want to come back. And they

23:56.593 --> 23:58.515
said, we want you to come back. We will let you take 
this whole area of neurosurgery and develop it as a

23:58.616 --> 24:05.344
new specialty within the hospital, within the 
curriculum. So what more could a young person at my

24:06.218 --> 24:15.661
age want than to be able to come back here and 
develop that specialty? So we made the decision in

24:15.681 --> 24:22.759
December of 68. So no search committee, no 
national ads. Not that I'm aware of. I think the

24:30.458 --> 24:33.140
department head and the dean's office. Who was the 
department head then? Mr. Callahan, Dr.

24:35.322 --> 24:38.165
Callahan. Nick. Nick Callahan. And I'll never 
forget this. We came by to finalize things with

24:43.731 --> 24:50.017
them. And we started looking for a house. And we 
looked over on Mary Oaks and found a home that we

24:53.080 --> 24:59.278
loved, but it would stretch us financially, and we 
knew it. But it was not yet completed. The inside

25:02.848 --> 25:04.051
was not. But we went ahead and signed a contract. 
And my wife selected everything in that home in one

25:08.386 --> 25:12.390
day. And we left. We never saw that home again until 
we drove up with a U-Haul truck and unloaded in

25:14.211 --> 25:21.477
March of 69. Oh, my. And it was beautiful. Oh, how 
good, how good. Not going to ask dollars anymore

25:25.341 --> 25:27.263
after this. What was the beginning salary?

25:34.109 --> 25:36.891
I believe it was somewhere around $24,000.

25:39.453 --> 25:49.124
And did anybody give you any guidelines at all 
other than what you just mentioned about what your

25:39.453 --> 25:49.124
responsibilities were? You were to develop a new 
area. I was to develop a new area. I was given a job

25:54.210 --> 26:05.983
description of what a faculty member's 
responsibilities would be in the small animal

25:54.210 --> 26:05.983
medicine and surgery department. I knew what 
having already almost three years in the academic

26:06.841 --> 26:34.182
arena I knew what the tenure requirements would be 
I purposely put in that I wanted to do some

26:06.841 --> 26:34.182
additional kinds of research and I knew I would be 
teaching that specialty both in the clinic with a

26:06.841 --> 26:34.182
group of students as well as in the lecture room

26:35.444 --> 26:41.191
And that I would have some student 
responsibilities of counseling students as they

26:35.444 --> 26:41.191
would come to me.

26:44.395 --> 26:47.719
And so you began then in the fall of? The spring, 
March of 1969. 69. They were still on three year?

26:53.647 --> 26:53.907
Yes. Still on? Yes. Did you turn to anyone for any 
particular advice early in the?

27:06.815 --> 27:13.824
I don't recall any specific person that I went to 
for counsel or advice. I knew a fair number of them

27:14.646 --> 27:22.356
because I had had some of them when I was a student as 
a faculty member.

27:26.081 --> 27:33.531
I knew the department head, I knew Dr. Callahan, I 
knew Dr. Ellett who was head of the small animal

27:26.081 --> 27:33.531
component of it at that time. And I know that I 
periodically would go to them for certain things.

27:39.487 --> 27:47.301
But remarkably back then, you were pretty well 
given your job description and you were turned

27:39.487 --> 27:47.301
loose. And I looked at it as a great advantage. I 
mean, here it is, go with it. Were there any perhaps

27:54.012 --> 28:05.009
amusing incidents of where someone spoke to you as 
if you were still a student, forgot that you were

27:54.012 --> 28:05.009
now their colleague? No, I never had that. That 
never happened? I really didn't and that was very

28:07.312 --> 28:18.148
assuring so many times because I was really looked 
at as a colleague Sometimes I would go to like Dr.

28:18.635 --> 28:46.009
Jean Gowing in medicine if I had a complicated case 
that the surgical component was now complicated

28:18.635 --> 28:46.009
because of a medical issue and I would frequently 
go to them for medical consultation because I knew

28:18.635 --> 28:46.009
that they were older and sage and wisdom of knowing 
those things so they were always there for me but

28:46.546 --> 28:50.270
They treated me as a real peer and as a real 
colleague. Now, the department at that time,

28:50.711 --> 28:54.175
about how many colleagues? Oh, that was a big 
department. I think we probably had at least about

28:55.717 --> 28:57.940
40 people then. And as far as you were aware, where 
did Texas A&M Veterinary Medicine in general and

28:59.662 --> 29:10.174
in that specialty look? Where did Texas A&M and 
small animal medicine, where did it win? It would

29:18.665 --> 29:21.087
have been in the top five. There's no question when 
you go to national meetings that you would be part

29:21.107 --> 29:28.074
of it. Texas A&M, you were one of the top five. Who 
were the other top? Cornell, University of

29:32.999 --> 29:41.747
California, Davis, University of Pennsylvania,

29:46.773 --> 29:49.376
Maybe Ohio State at times. They had a few 
weaknesses in it, but they were considered one of

29:49.516 --> 29:54.300
the better ones too. And the facilities you were 
provided and the staff you were given, were they

29:55.081 --> 30:00.927
adequate? Yes, we had good facilities. We had good 
staff. We had good staff support.

30:08.755 --> 30:11.537
And of course, we were growing rapidly. The 
Veterinary Teaching Hospital, because of the

30:13.279 --> 30:16.442
specialist because ophthalmology was off the 
ground, orthopedics, dermatology, all of the

30:17.013 --> 30:23.260
specialties were just booming. And we were almost 
marginal in the surgery area because of the

30:24.942 --> 30:32.031
caseload and the referral cases that were 
beginning to come here. But, you know, we were

30:32.711 --> 30:34.994
pleased. They were excellent. The surgery... 
cases in general, what were they? Where did they

30:42.779 --> 30:43.940
come from? They came from all over the state of 
Texas. I had cases flown in here from West Texas. I

30:53.294 --> 31:07.135
had one flown in, I'll never forget this, from some 
people that actually were from I think Abilene or

30:53.294 --> 31:07.135
somewhere in that area that are the owners of the 
big apple orchard out in the state of Washington. I

31:11.843 --> 31:13.726
mean, they ship all over the world. It's a famous 
name, and I'm sorry I can't think of it right now.

31:17.009 --> 31:25.478
But we met them at the airport, and they had a poodle 
that was paralyzed from a herniated disc, and that

31:17.009 --> 31:25.478
was my specialty. And we met them at the airport, 
brought them over to the clinic, told them what we

31:26.539 --> 31:31.705
could do, and told them I thought that I could...
