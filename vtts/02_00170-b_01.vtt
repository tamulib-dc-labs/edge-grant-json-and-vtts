WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:07.447
Two things that I know Mr. Benson was working on 
that was very important. He knew that the

00:07.467 --> 00:23.341
enrollment of Texas A&M, A&M's future, we either 
had to increase the enrollment or we had to decide

00:07.467 --> 00:23.341
what Texas A&M was going to be at that time because 
enrollment was not growing. It was static. And I'm

00:25.743 --> 00:30.207
not sure why, but UT Arlington at that time was 
separated from Texas A&M. That was a part of the A&M

00:36.861 --> 00:48.278
system, and why the decision was made to 
relinquish that and go to the UT system, I'm not

00:36.861 --> 00:48.278
sure, but I do remember working on some of those 
proposals. I don't know who recommended it, and I

00:49.921 --> 00:59.856
remember a man by the name, seemed like his name was 
Dr. Wolf, that was the first president of UT

00:49.921 --> 00:59.856
Arlington, what became UT Arlington. It had been 
Arlington State? Yes, it had been Arlington

01:02.293 --> 01:03.737
State. I don't know exactly what our presence was 
there and why we decided to give it up. I don't know

01:09.090 --> 01:10.774
how those proposals came about. I think that that 
was the board's plan is they would take all the A&M

01:11.918 --> 01:21.249
money and put it in one place. And what they did was 
to narrow the political base that Texas A&M and the

01:21.269 --> 01:28.638
system could call upon. And, of course, now 
there's exactly the opposite. The opposite,

01:31.821 --> 01:32.502
right. Yeah. I can remember him writing letters on 
proposals that we must work in the legislature to

01:37.315 --> 02:05.955
increase salaries for faculty that the salaries 
were so low that if A&M were to ever attract and

01:37.315 --> 02:05.955
today we still see that same statement being made 
we must stay competitive in salaries and he worked

01:37.315 --> 02:05.955
hard to try to do that and I would see some of the 
salary letters actually I typed a lot of the salary

01:37.315 --> 02:05.955
letters in engineering and I can remember I 
thought they were fairly good salaries at that

01:37.315 --> 02:05.955
time but an engineer graduating, if he got a salary 
offer of seven or eight thousand dollars a year,

02:06.627 --> 02:17.322
that was a high salary going out with a bachelor's 
degree in engineering. So if you saw a faculty

02:18.243 --> 02:29.919
person's salary that many of the faculty made no 
more than that, that seemed like a good salary, and

02:18.243 --> 02:29.919
of course it was a pathetic salary at that time. Did 
y'all ever think about transferring or dropping

02:30.981 --> 02:36.448
out of college? No, that was never an option. No, we 
never considered that. You were determined to...

02:40.418 --> 02:44.748
Oh yeah, we came to stay for Don to graduate. And 
there weren't any crisis semesters in terms of his

02:45.189 --> 02:49.459
grades. Yes, last semester, just before 
graduation, he had made a D in one of his petroleum

02:49.743 --> 03:07.828
engineering classes, and you had to take an 
additional test to make sure that you were going to

02:49.743 --> 03:07.828
graduate because you couldn't graduate with that 
D in your major, even in one course. And I think he

03:07.908 --> 03:10.872
made a C in that course, and he graduated. But it was 
a little tense that one semester. As you... you

03:18.295 --> 03:20.264
remember the routine. As the years went on, did the 
hours of work and study for both of you continue

03:26.986 --> 03:28.247
about the same? Well, they were intense. I can 
remember one year at Easter, we didn't even

03:30.630 --> 03:52.453
consider going home because Don had a major 
project that was due, and he spent the entire, we

03:30.630 --> 03:52.453
used to get Thursday and Friday before Easter off, 
and then the Saturday and Sunday, and he spent the

03:30.630 --> 03:52.453
entire four days, he and Jack Little and a few of the 
others spent at the petroleum engineering lab,

03:30.630 --> 03:52.453
and Come to find out when they returned the next 
Monday, there were a few of them gave up on the

03:52.653 --> 03:57.077
problem and went home. They found out from the 
professor it was unsolvable. So we had stayed here

04:00.920 --> 04:05.244
the holiday to an unsolvable problem. And he was 
testing them to see if they came up with a solution.

04:08.727 --> 04:21.698
If we could interview some of the cross-section of 
his classmates, who do you think they would say

04:08.727 --> 04:21.698
were their favorite teachers, the ones they most 
appreciated? I wish I could remember all the names

04:23.146 --> 04:27.903
in the Petroleum Engineering Department. Many 
would name Mr. Whiting, Dr. Pettigo,

04:39.920 --> 04:40.661
There were others. I'd have to look at it. If I could 
look at an annual, I can remember the names. What

04:44.626 --> 04:50.133
about in some of the courses that were support 
outside petroleum engineering? Were there some

04:50.153 --> 04:53.617
people in other courses that they? Yeah, there was 
a history class that they all loved. Remember who

04:58.343 --> 05:06.192
taught

04:58.343 --> 05:06.192
it? I dealt with that without looking at the 
annual. When we get the transcript back, if I can

05:08.675 --> 05:12.119
remember the names, I'll plug them in for you. And 
were there some courses that they feared, that

05:12.980 --> 05:20.227
were tough?

05:20.247 --> 05:23.611
Well, there probably were. Like chemistry, math, 
physics? Oh, I remember Don and Bob Lacy

05:27.795 --> 05:32.440
complaining more about calculus than they did 
anything. They studied together and argued

05:32.480 --> 05:36.825
together around my kitchen table a lot. But I think 
they knew that if anybody could pass them, if you

05:37.531 --> 05:42.036
worked hard enough, you could do it. That was the 
worst thing. Where did Lacy live in those days? He

05:45.360 --> 05:47.562
lived in the dorm on campus without a car. So the 
first two years, I don't think he had a car. He might

05:51.506 --> 05:53.248
have had one the last two years. But he spent a lot of 
time at our department. And

05:56.832 --> 06:03.820
let's try to look at the student body from a 
different point of view. Describe the typical.

06:07.923 --> 06:09.807
person who lived at College View? Were they Anglo? 
Were they working class? Were they from Texas?

06:18.824 --> 06:24.474
The majority of students in the 56 to 60 were Texans 
that lived there. Tuition was very low at Texas

06:25.196 --> 06:27.300
A&M. There wasn't even a building use fee.

06:32.678 --> 06:34.944
Rent was cheap in College View. All the people that 
lived in College View were married. The single

06:38.936 --> 06:41.784
people did live usually in the dorms on campus. 
There wasn't much off-campus living for

06:41.804 --> 06:45.675
students.

06:48.288 --> 06:52.393
The majority had very little money, so money was 
not an issue. You didn't feel out of place, that we

06:52.433 --> 06:58.280
weren't trying to keep up with the Joneses, so to 
speak. Some had fairly good running cars, and

06:58.921 --> 07:03.427
others had some that didn't run so well. Some of us 
carpooled. We took our own lunches. There wasn't

07:08.593 --> 07:10.135
any place to eat on campus. So you packed your 
lunch, or you went home for lunch. What would have

07:13.259 --> 07:16.843
been a typical lunch for you that you packed? um a 
bologna sandwich and chips and a piece of fruit

07:16.823 --> 07:40.131
don't remember taking a drink so there must have 
been a coke machine in the building but you know

07:16.823 --> 07:40.131
lots of bologna sandwiches when we were in school 
and

07:16.823 --> 07:40.131
of these students were they all small small town or 
big city or Well, they were from both. Houston,

07:44.085 --> 07:47.695
Dallas were most of the from that came from the 
city. And then we came, of course, from near the

07:48.818 --> 07:53.833
Abilene area. I don't remember a lot of students 
from far West Texas coming here. I suspect they

07:58.825 --> 08:02.511
were going to Tech rather than coming here. And I 
don't remember a lot from the Valley coming here.

08:06.237 --> 08:08.762
So we were a little town. You really wanted to come 
to Texas A&M to be here. And on the weekends, did

08:13.550 --> 08:16.395
pretty well everybody stay here? Oh, no, a lot of 
the Corps went home, and then there were weigh

08:16.696 --> 08:27.387
stations along the way for the Corps, 
particularly at Waco, and you could just stand in

08:16.696 --> 08:27.387
the weigh station, and they hitchhiked a lot. But 
you knew if you were in your Corps uniform,

08:27.908 --> 08:30.711
somebody would pick you up. Did you? We always 
picked up students. Did you? If we were on Sunday

08:34.635 --> 08:41.522
coming home or if we were going home on Friday, we'd 
pick up students if they were going our direction.

08:41.637 --> 08:44.039
Were they always well-behaved when you picked 
them up? We never had a problem. We didn't think

08:45.601 --> 08:46.582
about that. I haven't run into anybody yet who 
remembers having a problem either as the one who

08:46.942 --> 08:56.110
picks them up or the one who was picked up. No. Two or 
three have said some guy tried to buy them a little

08:57.972 --> 09:07.461
more beer than they should have, or he drove too 
fast, but that's the worst thing they've ever

08:57.972 --> 09:07.461
mentioned. Yeah, we never had any problem. Let's 
see, on that, for you as a young woman, did any

09:09.667 --> 09:18.378
single Aggie ever attempt to flirt with you when 
you were in the office or anything? Oh, yes.

09:19.259 --> 09:19.580
Really? Yes, you have that. But you can handle it 
very much like you do today. You let them know

09:23.985 --> 09:26.989
you're not interested, and they behaved. They 
were well-behaved. They knew your boss was right

09:28.010 --> 09:33.317
behind the door, and so they didn't really try a lot 
of things. As far as y'all were aware, if anybody

09:35.823 --> 09:45.614
had really wanted to go and venture a little, where 
did Aggies go to drink beer or anything else? There

09:46.656 --> 09:59.130
was a place on Texas Avenue fairly close to where,

09:46.656 --> 09:59.130
what's the coffee shop over here on Texas Avenue 
right across from them? The breakfast place.

10:03.036 --> 10:03.377
Denny's? Denny's. There was a place there that 
some drank beer. I can't remember the name of it.

10:11.231 --> 10:14.016
There was a place called Martin's that they could 
drink beer. And then some went to the river, so to

10:14.076 --> 10:20.107
speak. To Whiskey Bridge? To Whiskey Bridge, so to 
speak, yes, to drink. Did married students ever go

10:23.765 --> 10:26.730
to the clay pits to swim? I don't know what the clay 
pits were. There was a place out here, and it was an

10:28.753 --> 10:43.095
old, where they had scooped clay out of the ground, 
and there was water in there, stagnant water, and

10:28.753 --> 10:43.095
that's where students would sometimes go to swim 
and drink a little bit of beer. I wasn't even aware

10:43.756 --> 10:44.937
it was there. But we came here as married students, 
so we were never in that single life of... Did you

10:51.693 --> 10:56.578
all ever have beer at your apartment? Yes, for 
special occasions. Sometimes the whole

10:58.741 --> 11:03.606
apartment complex would have a Friday night 
cookout, cook hamburgers. We might have a little

11:04.367 --> 11:05.428
beer. I'm not sure that we could have beer outside 
the apartments. In student housing, you could

11:09.352 --> 11:11.354
have it inside. And all of the area, the green space 
where College View is now, At that time, that was

11:19.452 --> 11:22.616
full of apartments, is that right? That's 
correct, yes. It was just row after row of

11:23.998 --> 11:26.902
apartments. Was the coin-operated 
wash-a-terrier up near where the Ramada would be

11:28.384 --> 11:35.934
built? Was it yet there? That one wasn't there, but 
there was a coin-operated one near Erleberg

11:38.117 --> 11:49.172
Shopping Center because I do remember taking 
laundry on Saturday Once I got a washing machine,

11:50.097 --> 11:53.684
I'd take it up there to dry it. So I know there was a 
coin-operated one on Texas Avenue near the Early

11:54.265 --> 11:58.974
Bird Shopping Center. As far as you can recall, 
about what percentage of the people that you knew

11:58.994 --> 12:06.689
in College View had a washing machine?

12:10.095 --> 12:11.498
Oh, maybe 50. And no one had a dryer because they 
weren't wired for a dryer. You didn't even have. So

12:16.855 --> 12:18.398
it wouldn't matter if you could afford. Yeah. And 
about how many had a TV?

12:24.908 --> 12:26.230
Oh, probably 50%. And telephone?

12:30.597 --> 12:34.227
Fifty to sixty percent, yeah. Did you all stay in 
the same apartment? Yes. Three and a half years.

12:38.359 --> 12:39.582
Three and a half years. Now in the summers, what was 
the routine for you all? summer classes. Don was in

12:47.439 --> 12:48.662
class by seven. He always took at least six hours 
each term. We had two long terms and work and study

12:53.311 --> 13:00.366
and maybe a driving movie and that was it. Did y'all 
keep the paper route a long time? Probably a couple

13:04.254 --> 13:05.717
of years. And you stayed in the dean's office all 
that time? Except for the one year that I worked in

13:09.746 --> 13:12.090
the placement office. Yeah, yeah. I worked in the 
placement office from September 56 to November

13:13.011 --> 13:20.083
57, and then in the dean's office until Don 
graduated in May of 60.

13:23.589 --> 13:29.038
Let's see, and you never thought about dropping 
out, never thought about transferring.

13:30.402 --> 13:33.506
No grade, no grade crises. Except one course. 
Yeah, yeah. And there was, I'm not sure there was,

13:37.070 --> 13:42.857
I'm not sure you could drop a course and have a cue 
drop as you do today. So that was never an option.

13:45.420 --> 13:48.344
You didn't think about cue dropping a course. 
Right. Can you remember your husband going to seek

13:48.504 --> 14:00.358
the advice of somebody, some faculty member, and 
in hindsight the advice that he got was important?

14:02.279 --> 14:06.900
or somebody gave him guidance, counsel, that 
turned out to be him? Well, yes. He was a student

14:11.493 --> 14:16.903
member of Tau Beta Pi, the Engineering Honor 
Society. And one of his best friends was running

14:17.844 --> 14:22.473
for president of the Engineering Honor Society. 
His name was Michael McGuire. And he was the,

14:24.075 --> 14:31.028
matter of fact, he was the, had the highest grade 
point ratio on campus of any student. And so Don was

14:31.048 --> 14:33.332
working in his campaign. Someone suggested that 
Don run, and of course he didn't consider doing

14:33.312 --> 14:47.406
that at all, because he was going to work for Mike, 
and then he was nominated from the floor the night

14:33.312 --> 14:47.406
of the election and was elected president of 
Taubatuckapai. I didn't really want to go to work

14:48.061 --> 14:57.555
the next morning because I was working for Mr. 
McGuire, the father of Mike McGuire at that time,

14:48.061 --> 14:57.555
and I knew that was not going to be a real happy day 
for him. But it turned out that Don's faculty

14:58.296 --> 15:08.691
person had told him, you know, this would be a good 
thing for him to do because he'd go to national

14:58.296 --> 15:08.691
meetings and be exposed to some things that he 
wouldn't be exposed to on campus. And sure enough,

15:09.492 --> 15:13.258
he got to go to the national convention, which was 
held at...

15:22.013 --> 15:23.115
trying to remember where it was held. Anyway, I do 
remember that he had to have at least two suits to

15:23.775 --> 15:27.661
go, and he didn't have those. And so we had to figure 
out how to save enough money for him to get two suits

15:27.861 --> 15:33.429
to go to the National Convention. It was at Purdue. 
That's where it was held, yeah. So that turned out

15:35.892 --> 15:44.865
to be good advice for him and made him a lot more so, 
gave him a lot more confidence in what he could do.

15:45.318 --> 15:48.402
All right, now you're mentioning the two suits. 
What would have been his and your wardrobe at that?

15:53.529 --> 15:54.370
How many outfits? Well, I can remember very 
carefully, I can remember when I was pregnant how

15:55.572 --> 16:00.458
many I had. I had exactly,

16:00.478 --> 16:06.426
the first time I was pregnant, I think I had four. 
And so you worked five days a week, so you had to

16:07.267 --> 16:12.574
figure out how to get it washed and dried and ironed 
so you could, have another time. And then in 1960,

16:13.884 --> 16:20.816
when I was pregnant, I think I actually had five 
outfits that I could wear. And even when I wasn't

16:20.976 --> 16:26.045
pregnant, there was very limited wardrobe. I had 
come with a few clothes. How many winter coats,

16:27.868 --> 16:29.851
long coats? Oh, you only had one. You didn't even 
consider having more than that. And a pair of

16:33.958 --> 16:35.541
shoes. Well, I probably had two. I had a very hard 
foot to fit, and I had to order my shoes, and they

16:37.772 --> 16:44.407
were very expensive, so I might have had two. And 
did a woman working in the office wear high heels?

16:48.657 --> 16:49.478
Oh, yes, yes. We were expected to wear high heels, 
yes. And sweaters? Yeah, we could wear sweaters.

16:57.305 --> 17:01.529
But they were just like a cordigan sweater that we 
would wear. Do you remember any woman ever

17:02.650 --> 17:11.818
attempting to push the dress code during that era? 
No, not really. Because don't I remember, weren't

17:13.700 --> 17:23.989
you the one under Calhoun that went on behalf of the 
group to ask if it would be all right to wear

17:26.062 --> 17:29.505
dress slacks, pantsuits, I want to say. Because I 
thought it would. This is in the 70s. This is in the

17:36.472 --> 17:37.353
70s. Yes, I think I did ask Calhoun if we could wear a 
pantsuit because pantsuits had come in into the

17:37.453 --> 17:43.959
70s as an outfit. And wasn't his response to kind of 
chuckle? Yeah, he did. And say, of course? Of

17:48.324 --> 17:49.064
course, he did. But we didn't have any pantsuits 
during the 50s. It was dresses. Were there any

17:55.441 --> 18:06.276
scandals during the 50s that you heard of on campus 
of a secretary and some important person? We're

18:06.336 --> 18:07.958
not going to name any names. Were there any 
scandals of somebody courting somebody else's

18:07.978 --> 18:16.770
secretary, anything like that? I've not heard of 
any. If there were, I wasn't aware of them. Because

18:22.964 --> 18:35.260
I remember one time hearing Dean Benson say that he 
thought the unwritten rules at that point were you

18:22.964 --> 18:35.260
never serve alcohol at an event where there are 
students. That's correct. If you are divorcing or

18:37.022 --> 18:50.440
heading toward a divorce and you get another job at 
another institution, and if you're gambling,

18:37.022 --> 18:50.440
playing poker or anything like that for money, You 
closed the blinds and the curtains. I remember

18:55.509 --> 19:03.101
there were a few faculty members that had a 
drinking problem during the 50s. And they were

19:03.822 --> 19:09.551
brought in for counseling by Mr. Benson or Mr. 
Crawford.

19:12.716 --> 19:17.203
But other than that, those were probably the only 
scandals. What about faculty members meeting

19:17.302 --> 19:21.212
class? How often did they fail to meet class? I 
wasn't aware that they never not showed. And how

19:28.574 --> 19:34.642
many hours a day were they available for students? 
Oh, they were there all day. Any time a student

19:35.763 --> 19:44.054
wanted to see their faculty member, they could go 
by, and they would be there unless they were in

19:35.763 --> 19:44.054
class teaching another section. So finding your 
prof was not a problem during the 50s. And how did

19:49.041 --> 19:52.185
faculty members dress in that era? usually just 
pants and shirt, tie, and many times they very few

19:52.486 --> 20:02.349
wore coats, and there certainly were no sandals, 
and there were no shorts.

20:05.617 --> 20:08.183
What about their haircut and their facial hair? 
They could have some facial hair, but they usually

20:08.973 --> 20:11.637
had short hair. There was no long hair. Did they 
have beards? I'm not sure. Some of them may have had

20:16.003 --> 20:19.187
some beard, but it was well-trimmed. There were no 
long beards, no long hair, no ponytails, no blue

20:19.508 --> 20:26.738
jeans.

20:27.499 --> 20:33.968
During the 50s, were there any student, far-out 
activities here?

20:37.053 --> 20:48.065
Well, when you say far out, there were some things 
like the Corps would allow women to come into the

20:37.053 --> 20:48.065
dorms, and that was against the rules. And then 
they would do crazy things like put them in the

20:48.145 --> 20:54.692
laundry bags to get them out of the dorms so that no 
one would know they were there. So yes, we heard

20:54.832 --> 21:03.381
about some of those and some of the names of some of 
the dorms and some of the names of the women that

20:54.832 --> 21:03.381
were brought in for that. Those were crazy 
activities that took place, and then

21:03.361 --> 21:17.393
occasionally students would go during deer 
season and shoot deer and then gut it and clean it in

21:03.361 --> 21:17.393
the shower stalls within the dorms. But those 
students were single students usually that were

21:18.314 --> 21:23.639
living in the dorms, very few married students in 
the dorms. Did your husband do any hunting or

21:24.620 --> 21:27.903
fishing while you all were here? No. We camped out a 
couple of times.

21:33.483 --> 21:38.873
near Huntsville, just a tent to cook out overnight 
and just to sleep out on cots and things like that.

21:38.893 --> 21:41.357
But we were not big hunters or fishermen. How often 
did you all go to Houston or Dallas or Austin? We

21:45.265 --> 21:46.908
never went to Austin. And we went to Houston to the 
Fat Stock Show. And Dallas, we went maybe... once

21:53.750 --> 21:59.536
or twice a year with the Smithwicks because his 
family lived there on Campbell Road in

21:53.750 --> 21:59.536
Richardson. Richard Dick Smithwick was one of 
them. Well, he was the first Bear Bryant recruit

22:03.639 --> 22:07.383
out of Richardson, Texas. And we'd go there to stay 
with his family a couple of times a year. A while

22:11.867 --> 22:20.055
ago, I meant to ask, were there any Hispanic 
students living anywhere near you all? Did you

22:20.596 --> 22:21.917
know any Hispanic?

22:26.285 --> 22:28.587
Well, I don't know that they were Hispanic. We 
didn't think about it as Hispanic. There were some

22:31.670 --> 22:32.891
from Puerto Rico. Okay. But they probably came 
here through way of Louisiana. And how were they

22:38.436 --> 22:40.238
received? Well received. They were good friends. 
I mean, we didn't think about them any

22:42.320 --> 22:44.141
differently. As far as I remember, though, there 
were no African-American students here at that

22:45.162 --> 22:49.666
time. I cannot remember any African-American 
students. Were there any Jewish students? Oh,

22:55.647 --> 22:57.409
yeah, there were Jewish students here. And how 
were they? Well, we just saw them as the same

22:58.630 --> 23:02.893
classmate, you know, as an equal classmate. There 
was not a lot of discrimination, I don't think,

23:03.474 --> 23:09.159
here in the 50s, early 60s. People were here for an 
education. It was a serious business. And

23:15.584 --> 23:20.849
thinking about your future career, I think that 
was the main goals of students. We were not

23:21.289 --> 23:24.912
concerned a lot about student life. That was not a 
big issue on campus. To fit you in with the culture

23:27.996 --> 23:32.382
was not the university's goal. It was academics 
and studies. Would you all walk from College View

23:35.927 --> 23:40.674
over to the MSC sometimes after? No, we usually 
drove. Oh, did you? Yeah, we had a car most of the

23:42.897 --> 23:45.560
time, and we would normally drive. Would you 
sometimes get at the snack bar? No, not a lot. We

23:51.449 --> 23:54.713
didn't have a lot of discretionary funds, so we 
didn't do that. the, let's

23:55.553 --> 24:14.324
see, we talked about the churches and so forth, and 
I was trying to think about other diversity

23:55.553 --> 24:14.324
issues. Women were were politely treated by the 
students. Oh, every student spoke to you, yes.

24:22.838 --> 24:26.344
Howdy was a typical response. They spoke first and 
expected you to speak back. Now, there was no

24:30.312 --> 24:40.090
effort, no campaign to orient you student wives 
about Aggie traditions. If there was, it was

24:40.728 --> 24:45.633
through your own departmental club, if you did. So 
after you, say, joined petroleum engineering

24:45.673 --> 24:55.082
wives, they may have talked about traditions, but 
no, I don't remember any orientation for me. And

24:55.522 --> 25:00.187
then when your husband graduated, the wife got a 
little diploma that said putting hubby through.

25:00.247 --> 25:02.609
Most of us put it up in our laundry rooms. Was there a 
Breckenridge hometown club? No, not that I

25:06.428 --> 25:07.691
remember. There might have been, but I wasn't 
really involved in it at all. When did you begin to

25:12.320 --> 25:19.935
feel that you were part of the Aggie group, the 
Aggie family? How long did that take?

25:26.594 --> 25:32.181
I think we were much, felt much more a part of the 
Aggie family after we left than when we were here.

25:32.201 --> 25:32.801
Oh, really? Uh-huh. Because we were so busy while 
we were here, you didn't think about those things.

25:37.307 --> 25:45.296
And then as A&M began to grow and its reputation 
began to increase, I think we were proud to have

25:37.307 --> 25:45.296
been Aggies, I guess. So the pride was more after 
than while here? Uh-huh. For us, it was. We didn't

25:53.030 --> 25:57.476
have anyone that, you know, our ties were not as 
strong. But we realized our future was built on

25:57.796 --> 26:04.526
what we had accomplished here, yes. Don's degree 
served him well.

26:10.835 --> 26:11.055
Right. And there was no, he didn't do a summer 
working somewhere out for a company? No, he had

26:18.694 --> 26:26.284
already done that so that he got academic credit 
for that internship because he had done prior work

26:18.694 --> 26:26.284
and certified that. Okay, and what was the 
activity then? How were young men prepared for

26:31.471 --> 26:39.362
their interviews and that first job? I don't think 
there was a lot of preparation. I think you came by

26:42.900 --> 26:54.335
the placement office, got your credentials 
ready, signed up for your interviews and showed up

26:42.900 --> 26:54.335
for your interviews, but there was not an 
orientation as to how to conduct yourself in that

26:42.900 --> 26:54.335
interview. And do you remember where the 
interviews were held? Oh, they were held at the

26:58.119 --> 27:00.002
placement office. Which was, okay, where then? 
the little building that was torn down, the frame

27:03.828 --> 27:09.877
building that was torn down.

27:14.483 --> 27:17.928
There might have been a few in the MSC if they ran out 
of space. And I remember that a lot of the companies

27:18.669 --> 27:25.359
came and always seemed very polite to us. The 
interviewers came.

27:30.005 --> 27:33.430
What, for you all in the dean's office, What 
feedback did you all get from the interviewers

27:33.646 --> 27:39.732
about their impression of the Aggies? Most of the 
impressions that I got came from the placement

27:42.095 --> 27:45.799
office rather than the dean's office. The 
feedback came to Mr. Horsley and to Mr. Hensel. And

27:52.446 --> 27:58.472
they felt that they had the cream of the crop, so to 
speak.

27:59.752 --> 28:05.801
Teachers were hired, those that went into 
teaching as a profession, math majors taught a

27:59.752 --> 28:05.801
lot. So, yeah, school districts came, 
engineering companies came, chemical companies

28:05.841 --> 28:11.148
came. It

28:11.168 --> 28:17.337
was a big season always in the fall when the 
interviewers came. We had a few come in the spring,

28:17.598 --> 28:21.483
but most interviewing was done in the fall. Oh, 
really? Mm-hmm. Even for... May graduates. For a

28:28.121 --> 28:30.003
job, for May graduates, okay. Alright, in your 
case, when did the interviewing begin for your

28:30.443 --> 28:37.190
husband? Senior year. Senior year. Do you 
remember how many companies he interviewed with?

28:42.536 --> 28:44.478
I don't remember how many he interviewed with. I 
remember he got five offers. I do remember that.

28:47.281 --> 28:50.724
And do you remember what the offer was that he took? 
How much money? He went to work for ARCO, and I think

28:52.283 --> 29:00.398
it was about $7,000 a year, and we thought that was 
big money. Was it already called ARCO, or was it

29:01.059 --> 29:03.643
Atlantic Refining? It was Atlantic Refining at 
that time, yes. And he was to report when, where?

29:09.815 --> 29:12.840
Well, right after graduation, we were to report 
to... Longview, Texas. He was actually there at a

29:16.595 --> 29:20.582
plant called near Gladewater. And so we lived in 
Longview. And I remember that we went out to house

29:22.645 --> 29:25.330
hunt. We didn't know we could ask for an advance on 
our salary. So we had a little money that we were

29:27.654 --> 29:34.947
going to look for a place, look for a place to live 
and rent an apartment. And we had to stay a couple of

29:35.753 --> 29:38.476
days longer than we anticipated. We ran out of 
money and we counted our bank money. We sat on the

29:41.199 --> 29:46.865
floor and rolled the pennies and dimes to pay for 
the advance during that time. And you still didn't

29:46.905 --> 29:49.187
have furniture. Oh, no, we didn't have any 
furniture. We had a baby bed and a chest and a

29:50.649 --> 29:56.155
bookcase and an air conditioner. I think I had one 
in a raffle or something. And that same car. And the

30:01.260 --> 30:02.822
same car, correct. Okay. Let's see. No final 
review for this veteran. Commencement was held

30:11.359 --> 30:12.682
where? Do you remember? In Gone Hall. Do you 
remember? Was there an important speaker? Do you

30:16.992 --> 30:17.573
remember? I don't remember who it was. It was on a 
Saturday morning, I do remember that. And who,

30:23.011 --> 30:26.076
what family, what loved ones came? Don's mother 
came from New York for the graduation. And Don's

30:30.404 --> 30:40.843
brother, who had cancer, and he had been staying 
with us a lot because he had been in Houston taking

30:30.404 --> 30:40.843
treatments all of Don's senior year. And he and his 
wife and their little boy and my sister and her two

30:41.296 --> 30:47.561
children came for that event. And there was an 
apartment next to us that was going to be empty, and

30:48.102 --> 30:57.010
we borrowed that one so that we had our apartment 
and the empty one for the company. So that's how we

30:57.030 --> 30:59.031
arranged it. And what were your feelings when this 
special person started to walk across the stage?

31:08.440 --> 31:09.320
Oh, I was elated. It had been a long four years. Was 
there anything, did anybody do anything humorous

31:11.806 --> 31:16.763
at that commencement? Oh no, it was a serious 
ceremony. Everybody was serious? And they did get

31:20.115 --> 31:22.223
their diploma? In the tube at that time, that's 
correct.
