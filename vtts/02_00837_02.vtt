00:01.735 --> 00:10.388
His youngest child was a little girl who came for a 
time to live with my father's family. When she was

00:11.089 --> 00:28.114
about 13 and my dad was about 9, she came and she 
tells the story of the time that the

00:11.089 --> 00:28.114
great-grandmother had been left at home with her 
as the others went to the cotton fields to pick

00:28.820 --> 00:40.074
cotton that she was left at home while she studied 
because she was in school to look after. And not

00:40.394 --> 00:46.702
being used to doing this, she accidentally let her 
get away. She was sitting at the table studying

00:46.742 --> 00:57.595
when she noticed the grandmother had gotten a cup 
of coffee, and the next thing she knew, She had run

00:57.575 --> 01:27.227
out the front door and the front yard gate and down 
the road and she couldn't but the time she got out of

00:57.575 --> 01:27.227
the house she was running out into a wooded area and 
she lost her in the thick thick wooded part and

00:57.575 --> 01:27.227
couldn't find her and she became so upset that she 
ran to the cotton fields and got the rest of the

00:57.575 --> 01:27.227
family and they all came and combed the area all 
afternoon and that night until sometime at the

01:27.477 --> 01:32.391
night, and couldn't find the grandmother 
anywhere. And early the next morning, the nearest

01:33.614 --> 01:41.757
neighbor, about a half a mile or three-quarters of 
a mile up the road, was leaving to go to the cotton

01:42.209 --> 01:48.016
gin with a wagon load of cotton. He had the cotton 
sheet already tied down on it, and early the next

01:48.096 --> 01:56.086
morning about daylight, he started out to the 
cotton gin. And if you've ever been to a cotton gin,

01:57.308 --> 02:10.444
the wagons drive up beside a ramp, and there is a 
sort of a vacuum cleaner suction type, funnel,

02:11.268 --> 02:17.398
which comes down over the cotton in the wagon and 
sucks it up into the gin. And as the men took off the

02:17.438 --> 02:32.263
cotton sheet that morning, there was Grandmother 
Kathy lying up in the middle of the bale of cotton,

02:17.438 --> 02:32.263
all soft as she'd spent the night and had kept them 
warm. Of course, I suppose it was in August, so it

02:33.425 --> 02:37.512
was hot anyway, but, uh, They were all so 
astonished to find her in the neighborhood of my

02:38.234 --> 02:42.819
home that day.

02:47.064 --> 02:50.468
My great-grandmother was quite a character, I 
understand. She had lived on a plantation before

02:51.349 --> 02:58.477
the Civil War in Alabama and had had several 
slaves. And after she became senile and lost

02:59.218 --> 03:04.123
complete touch with reality, My daddy, as a little 
boy, would just listen to her and the things she'd

03:04.829 --> 03:14.203
say, and she'd stand at the window and give 
directions to her slaves. Give everybody

03:15.244 --> 03:17.628
directions for the day. And there was one named 
Caroline, which I suppose was Caroline, and one

03:18.349 --> 03:34.212
named Ike, and I don't remember other names, but my 
dad was so fascinated with how she thought and her

03:34.799 --> 03:46.178
reactions of what she would do, but of course all of 
this went with the Civil War, and I don't feel that

03:34.799 --> 03:46.178
that had an effect on her becoming senile. It was 
just that that was her way of life, and she still

03:46.338 --> 03:56.655
lived in that way in her thinking when she became 
older.

03:59.774 --> 04:02.518
Okay. After you moved to this area and after you got 
older, do you remember if there were any political

04:02.538 --> 04:08.687
bosses in this area? Or who controlled the use of 
the land? Who said, this man can have this area and

04:13.635 --> 04:18.201
this man can have this area? Was there any sort of 
time of control? Now, I don't recall, or I was

04:22.267 --> 04:26.153
not... I didn't realize if there was any sort of 
control in this area. I can remember as a child,

04:32.349 --> 04:41.307
people talking about down in the southern part of 
the state, there were a lot of problems then i

04:41.860 --> 05:03.649
believe there was a man named parr that had quite a 
political

04:41.860 --> 05:03.649
bill i'm not sure of the word but an empire a 
political empire in that part of the country and he

04:41.860 --> 05:03.649
really did control this is the only person in this 
area anywhere near that I can recall. I believe his

05:09.522 --> 05:13.367
name was Parr. I think it was Duval County. I see. 
What was the size of Bryan College Station when you

05:16.951 --> 05:21.396
first remember it? I came to Bryan College Station 
in 1951,

05:21.417 --> 05:32.590
and it was much smaller then. I suppose the total 
population

05:34.510 --> 05:40.656
would have been 25,000, maybe. I think Brown was 
about 18,000. And College Station, about 6,000 to

05:48.906 --> 05:55.856
8,000. Were they connected?

05:59.441 --> 06:04.989
There was a lot of vacant space in between. I can 
remember when there were no supermarkets. on the

06:09.442 --> 06:13.188
highway at all, on Highway 6. And when the first 
sort of supermarket was built, it was called

06:13.708 --> 06:28.671
Miller's, I believe, and it was where, it's right 
near Sherwin-Williams store there on the corner.

06:28.691 --> 06:33.559
And this was sitting out on the highway out there 
all by itself. There was nothing on there. And I can

06:35.642 --> 06:37.204
remember when the first nice motel was built. 
There was some little, small tourist port type,

06:40.469 --> 06:49.544
old-fashioned ports, two or three on the highway. 
But the Sands Motel was the largest and the biggest

06:49.564 --> 06:56.035
and the finest. It was the very first. But there was 
a lot of just... undeveloped area between Bryan

07:03.222 --> 07:07.367
and College Station. Now at one time, back when the 
college was just sitting out here by itself, there

07:07.387 --> 07:23.146
was an old trolley which ran between the campus and 
Bryan, an old trolley line. Who do you think were

07:23.247 --> 07:27.772
the most influential families of the area back 
then? Well now, some of the first families to come

07:33.378 --> 07:58.525
here i'm not sure if they were the most influential 
but they were real interested in developing the

07:33.378 --> 07:58.525
area my husband's family came in 1921 and at that 
time there were no houses in this off except in

07:33.378 --> 07:58.525
brian there were no houses around the college they 
had campus housing had old college houses that

07:58.876 --> 08:26.571
were in rows on the campus and all the faculty and 
administration lived in the campus housing and my

07:58.876 --> 08:26.571
husband's father and mother built the first house 
here on this lot that was ever built off the campus i

07:58.876 --> 08:26.571
think in 1922 and this was just a trail uh through 
this little wooded area down here and The little

08:27.091 --> 08:31.438
park that's Dexter Park now was a lake. There was a 
dam across the south end of the park. It was sort of

08:35.764 --> 08:38.548
where the little bridge is now. And it had been 
dammed up, and it was... They enjoyed the lake, but

08:43.977 --> 08:48.123
really it was not a real scenic type thing. It was 
mosquito-infested. But... The first families to

08:52.117 --> 08:56.541
build off the campus were on this street. And my 
husband's family and five others formed the

08:57.482 --> 09:04.009
Southside Development Company. And they 
developed this whole area. I mean, they

09:08.634 --> 09:17.162
developed, I suppose, what's called South Park 
right in here where we live. It's not a very large

09:17.834 --> 09:29.924
area now, but it was the first development off the 
campus around this little Dexter Park.

09:30.085 --> 09:35.769
What type of social services were there then, like 
fire police, schools, telephone? Is it pretty

09:36.870 --> 09:41.274
much like it is now, or has it changed a lot? In 1951, 
there was only one school out at College Station.

09:51.358 --> 09:55.030
It's in the local here on Jersey Street. The grade 
school was there, the junior high and the high

09:55.347 --> 09:59.593
school. They were in different buildings. The 
school system was not very wealthy. There's not

10:05.642 --> 10:23.768
much to tax in this area except just local 
families, and it was a rather poor school district

10:05.642 --> 10:23.768
as far as financing, but an excellent school 
system in that it had such good teachers and could

10:05.642 --> 10:23.768
draw from resources at the college. But the grade 
school was housed in little wooden buildings,

10:23.967 --> 10:32.260
which people jokingly called the chicken coops. 
They weren't very attractive. They're still

10:34.443 --> 10:39.290
there, but used just for storage and other things 
now. But this was the one school out here. And at

10:42.395 --> 10:46.020
that time, it was much smaller. It may have been a B 
school or an A school. Now it's AAA. It was a very

10:53.097 --> 10:54.561
small school. As a Girl Scout worker, I worked with 
all the schools in the area. The College Station

11:00.653 --> 11:04.121
school consolidated. It was a very outstanding 
school. One of the best, the elementary school was

11:08.669 --> 11:20.162
recognized as one of the top ten in the nation at 
that time for its reading program and other areas.

11:20.182 --> 11:27.250
It was far advanced, its reading techniques and 
that sort of thing. The Bryan schools were very

11:27.390 --> 11:33.377
good schools too, but as far as police and I think it 
was very adequate in the fire, that sort of thing.

11:39.107 --> 11:45.917
But, of course, it's had to grow with the community 
because it's so much larger now. Awesome. Well, I

11:47.460 --> 11:49.603
think that about concludes the interview. I want 
to thank you very much for this. Well, thank you for

11:52.988 --> 11:53.850
asking. I really enjoyed it. I did, too. Thank you 
for asking.
