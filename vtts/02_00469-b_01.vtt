WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:02.720
Okay. You like teamwork. Yeah. And you were seeing 
other people and step with you and you were

00:04.882 --> 00:10.148
attempting to do your part. You were attempting to 
keep a straight line. When you were working with

00:13.352 --> 00:19.759
artillery pieces, you were you wanted your part to 
be done when it needed to be done. If you want a

00:19.779 --> 00:23.904
rammer or you were carrying a projectile or 
whatever. I didn't want to buy weight. I wanted to

00:28.246 --> 00:32.232
If the breach needed opening, I didn't want the man 
with the projector waiting on me. And these kind of

00:33.174 --> 00:37.541
things have always fascinated me. I've always 
wanted to have my part done and nobody waiting on

00:38.202 --> 00:45.733
me. I don't know whether that's one of the things 
that projects you out forward of others or

00:45.753 --> 00:55.789
whatever, but it was just something about it that 
was fascinating. Now as a day student did you

00:56.073 --> 01:04.927
really feel part of the Corps or did in some ways you 
felt discriminated against? No I missed a whole

01:04.947 --> 01:06.911
lot. I missed a great deal. Didn't live in the 
dormitory. Got in on none of the hazing. I hardly

01:16.053 --> 01:21.802
ever went in the dormitory unless I went to study 
with some fellow student. So I know I missed a great

01:23.044 --> 01:37.407
deal of the core life, but farther up I went into the 
junior and senior year, of course I got more into

01:23.044 --> 01:37.407
the swing of it. But I did, I'm sure I missed a great 
deal of it. Some of it I guess I'm glad I missed. Some

01:44.240 --> 01:48.244
of it that I could probably look back on with a lot of 
enjoyment. Let's talk about your outfit. Were you

01:49.946 --> 01:51.107
part of an outfit? Yes. What kind of training did 
you have? Could you tell me about that? You're

01:54.331 --> 01:55.532
talking about in the Corps? Yeah. They actually 
had day student organizations made up of day

01:56.773 --> 02:02.159
students. Oh, day students. So you were in a day 
student outfit. That's right. As I remember, that

02:08.786 --> 02:10.748
was only

02:14.407 --> 02:18.032
freshman, sophomore years that they had the day 
student outfits. I could, they could have been

02:18.452 --> 02:24.380
into the junior, senior, but I know the freshman 
year we were in what we called day students. It was a

02:25.722 --> 02:29.046
Coast Artillery, one of the Coast Artillery 
units. Oh, so you, so you got into Coast Artillery

02:29.066 --> 02:32.671
early then. I started out in Coast Artillery and I 
was wondering how you got in now. For the reason

02:38.339 --> 02:43.165
was, Seacoast Artillery, which I was in, They, 
most all the calculations, the projections, the

02:44.343 --> 03:03.044
anticipated travel of the projectiles and all 
this was done mathematically, manually, with

02:44.343 --> 03:03.044
slide rules and this sort of thing. But they 
encouraged engineers to get into the Coast

03:03.104 --> 03:10.792
Artillery, and particularly Seacoast. Now, a lot 
of my classmates were in the Corps of Engineers,

03:15.106 --> 03:38.481
which I probably should have been but I listened to 
the counselor or whoever and he says that Coast

03:15.106 --> 03:38.481
Artillery is a good place for engineers because of 
your mathematical training and education and

03:15.106 --> 03:38.481
whatnot so I got in Coast Artillery and it was Oh I 
can't regret it a whole lot. I had a lot of

03:41.604 --> 03:49.900
experiences that gave me a great deal of 
satisfaction but that's what I was in and that's

03:41.604 --> 03:49.900
why. I didn't really know except that somebody 
said don't get in the infantry. and that's the

03:56.703 --> 04:03.149
thing I thought I didn't want in but you know that's 
a pretty important area too. So as a Coast

04:03.169 --> 04:11.317
Artillery Officer then would you be basically 
what we call fire control today? I mean were you

04:11.697 --> 04:15.821
oriented toward hitting the targets then? Well, 
are you talking about when I was on active duty?

04:20.365 --> 04:24.769
Yeah, to begin with in your first first few years of 
active duty. Is that what they tried to, let me

04:26.302 --> 04:29.926
rephrase that. Is that what they tried to train you 
to do when you were here in the Corps? Well, yes. You

04:34.311 --> 04:40.958
had training in, you see, Coastal Artillery, our 
targets were vessels. And the way they aimed and

04:42.359 --> 04:54.132
spotted them, unless it was what they used to call 
Case 3 where you couldn't see them, they were over

04:42.359 --> 04:54.132
the horizon, Then it was all done by catching the 
ship here and here and you knew in so many seconds

04:55.090 --> 05:03.641
he'd be here. That's the way we aimed. Now if he was 
over the horizon with the big guns then it had to be

05:06.905 --> 05:18.600
some more calculations but that's the type of 
thing that I'm talking about and then if the burst

05:06.905 --> 05:18.600
hit here You knew you were short so many seconds, 
feet, and whatever, and you recalculated. But

05:24.934 --> 05:28.817
that was all, that was the basic training of 
Coastal Artillery. But when I got on active duty,

05:30.279 --> 05:47.355
the fact that I was an engineer, I was more directed 
toward surveying in baselines, establishing

05:30.279 --> 05:47.355
base end positions that had to be exactly 
measured, They had to be exactly oriented. And I

05:50.099 --> 05:58.868
took survey crews and did this sort of thing for the 
fire control batteries and people that had to

05:50.099 --> 05:58.868
occupy these. And our spotting was done with a 
triangle, see, from these known points to this. So

06:05.635 --> 06:07.497
I did a lot of surveying. So, but it was... So, yeah, 
it's a generally problem. That's what it was.

06:14.925 --> 06:15.706
That's fascinating. For fixed coast 
artillery... You had a fixed end here and a fixed

06:18.014 --> 06:43.223
end here with an absolute known distance on the 
base and that's right and then you had a you had a one

06:18.014 --> 06:43.223
line and two angles you always knew and so they 
could they could project so that was part of my

06:18.014 --> 06:43.223
duties for a good long while was establishing 
these things. And what kind of training did you get

06:43.243 --> 06:46.367
down here at A&M in the court? Well, I was, of 
course, along with all the rest of them. We studied

06:52.080 --> 07:04.619
projectile travel, projectile

06:52.080 --> 07:04.619
variance due to various elements in the air and 
care of the guns. Of course, a lot of leadership

07:05.861 --> 07:11.309
courses is all the services. But it was mainly 
aimed toward being an artilleryman.

07:19.743 --> 07:24.789
The first two years are pretty basic, reality's 
what you're in. But a lot of the infantry tactics

07:25.190 --> 07:30.476
and parades are always fascinating. I loved that 
parade. I really did. I used to love those parades

07:36.083 --> 07:46.977
out there at the university, you know, the final 
reviews and the Mother's Day reviews and all these

07:36.083 --> 07:46.977
things. I loved those things. After I got on active 
duty, I really liked the parade. I did. I sure did.

07:59.389 --> 08:00.431
Why do you think that? You like the unison? That's 
right. Again, it's seeing people executing

08:04.356 --> 08:16.053
commands, seeing people following orders, 
seeing people act in unison. You know,

08:16.714 --> 08:18.336
everybody... Everybody got to be in step. If not, 
you sit, you know. It's just, it's that

08:23.768 --> 08:28.475
regimentation, I guess. You must love the Aggie 
band. Oh, that's the greatest thing in the world.

08:33.182 --> 08:37.129
It just tingles my spine, and I've seen it 10 
million times. That's incredible, isn't it?

08:40.233 --> 08:42.557
Couldn't believe it when I saw it when I came down 
here. Had you never seen it before? Oh, I never

08:44.360 --> 08:45.842
have. I might have had seen it on national 
television when they used to carry the Texas and

08:45.822 --> 08:57.760
the A&M games back when they played the 
Thanksgiving games, but now you don't see those on

08:45.822 --> 08:57.760
national television. It's absolutely 
fascinating. The farther up the line of command I

09:01.986 --> 09:09.838
got, I guess the more I enjoyed it. Even after I got 
to be a brigadier general on the beach. We always

09:13.936 --> 09:24.695
had a parade at some camp and we've had as many as, 
oh, at one time our unit had about 4,000 people in

09:13.936 --> 09:24.695
it. We've been to camp with 3,000, 3,500. That 
makes a pretty good parade. But we always had a

09:32.869 --> 09:36.315
parade, sometimes and sometimes not. Could you 
tell me about your colleagues in the Corps of

09:37.460 --> 09:45.468
Cadets, people that you went through? I made some 
real good friends.

09:50.273 --> 10:06.370
In fact, a lot of the ones, a lot of my senior, junior 
and senior and probably sophomore compadres, as I

09:50.273 --> 10:06.370
said a while ago, were called active youth at the 
same time. There was a colonel who used to be our, we

10:07.463 --> 10:13.931
call him, War Department inspector. Once a year, 
the War Department sent regular Army people down

10:14.732 --> 10:30.290
to inspect the units, the seniors and juniors, and 
I think mostly seniors and juniors, to evaluate

10:14.732 --> 10:30.290
the ROTC program. I'm sure it's still done. But 
this old colonel, I remember in particular, had

10:32.590 --> 10:37.595
been there a couple, three times. And how he got 
picked to organize this Coastal Artillery Unit, I

10:39.437 --> 10:48.065
really don't know, because that's done through 
the War Department. But he did, and apparently got

10:48.086 --> 10:55.753
the opportunity to select officers that he could 
call active duty. But we were called almost a year

10:56.394 --> 11:00.278
before Pearl Harbor. I got one of those early 
calls. And he selected about 60% of us from A&M. And

11:07.615 --> 11:16.965
gosh, I bet you there was half of my Coast Artillery 
class that got called to this unit. So not only made

11:16.985 --> 11:23.572
the friends there, but had them for four years 
during World War II. And right to this day, we still

11:24.233 --> 11:28.618
have a reunion of the World War II. Oh, really? How 
many are you? Well, this past summer, there are

11:32.260 --> 11:42.221
more than we get together, but this past summer we 
had a reunion set. There were, I guess, 16 of us that

11:43.122 --> 11:50.337
were going to go all the way to Myrtle Beach, South 
Carolina. to be with one of our commanding

11:50.755 --> 12:01.607
officers, and he was taken to Walter Reed Hospital 
and subsequently died, so we had to call off the

11:50.755 --> 12:01.607
reunion. But, well, I guess we were probably 17 or 
18. There still goes, every time we call or every

12:08.936 --> 12:19.228
time we've had a reunion, we've had about 21 
reunions since World War II. So, it was a

12:21.113 --> 12:25.978
camaraderie that really did last. So, you know. 
That's tremendous. It is, and it started right

12:27.920 --> 12:32.324
there in A&M. Of course, they've got a spree decor 
out there that's, it never dies. Anywhere you go,

12:40.833 --> 12:46.378
if there's an avian, you'll surface somewhere 
pretty quick. Let's talk about leadership. Did

12:49.466 --> 12:53.494
you have any position of leadership in the court? 
Well, my senior year I was on the regimental staff,

12:53.514 --> 13:03.895
which I guess you'd say was position leadership 
but I was not in the company ranks I was I was on the

13:04.516 --> 13:29.325
core staff I mean on the regimental staff I guess it 
was so uh that that's the first uh movement of uh out

13:04.516 --> 13:29.325
of the blind so to speak right so I was uh I thought I 
was proud of it oh your duties there Oh not uh not

13:30.790 --> 13:59.481
significant it's more you felt I guess a sense of 
pride of being put there probably I had less duties

13:30.790 --> 13:59.481
than if I'd been in one of the companies as far as you 
know things to do but uh we we had some

13:30.790 --> 13:59.481
responsibilities of planning maneuvers and 
planning you know at summer camp bivouacs and this

13:59.613 --> 14:27.595
sort of thing so there was there were some of the 
responsibilities that he would not have had just I

13:59.613 --> 14:27.595
guess down in the ranks now you meant let's talk 
about the things you liked and you disliked about

13:59.613 --> 14:27.595
the corps you've already mentioned that you like 
the uniform and you like the marching you like the

13:59.613 --> 14:27.595
parades you like the camaraderie any other things 
that you liked about the corps I always

13:59.613 --> 14:27.595
I always enjoyed being around army officers, the 
regular army officers who were our supervisors.

14:37.093 --> 14:37.373
Why? Why? Something about the military that I 
liked. I liked, I guess, a lot of the ways they wore

14:44.141 --> 14:50.749
the uniform. I liked to listen to some of the, of 
course, many of them were World War II, I mean,

14:51.230 --> 14:58.138
World War I, and then

14:58.810 --> 15:27.366
the old sergeants that were the backbone that ran 
the army you know back in the peacetime days I guess

14:58.810 --> 15:27.366
is the amount of chatter and big stories they told 
and you know you took in all that stuff we were young

14:58.810 --> 15:27.366
and aggressive and Nobody ever thought we'd go to 
war, I'm sure. But I don't know. There's just

15:35.276 --> 15:39.941
something about the military that fascinated me. 
I enjoyed it.

15:45.708 --> 15:51.254
I enjoyed being obedient to my superiors. I 
enjoyed the opportunity, as I've said two or three

15:51.274 --> 15:57.201
times, when they gave you something to do, to do it 
well. I always like to do it well. And the military

16:03.059 --> 16:08.366
lends itself to that more than civilian officers. 
And I like people to be obedient. I like people to

16:12.010 --> 16:19.860
take orders, and if they're proper and good, to 
carry them out to the nth degree. So the military

16:20.701 --> 16:25.467
just lends itself to that sort of thing. Over the 
years, I've availed myself of all the military

16:26.948 --> 16:35.280
schooling that I ever got an opportunity to go to, 
and I've been to a lot of them. It's

16:36.903 --> 16:41.810
enjoyable. That's the best description I can 
give. Now, you said you liked some of the regular

16:44.474 --> 16:47.518
Army officers. Any in particular that had an 
impact on you? Well, I was in school when this Major

16:52.463 --> 16:58.511
General Moore was a commandant.

17:01.475 --> 17:07.123
He was a full colonel at that time, who later was 
commanding Corregidor and was taken prisoner.

17:08.365 --> 17:15.274
And his bearing and posture used to just fascinate 
me. He was straight as a poker. he came around he

17:18.738 --> 17:36.242
would talk to freshmen or sophomores or you know 
anybody that that wasn't what he did all the time

17:18.738 --> 17:36.242
but when you were out on drill you know it never did 
surprise you if he stopped and talked to you. He was

17:37.404 --> 17:43.012
one of them in a major hill who was a Coastal 
Artillery Officer. I don't know they were sort of

17:43.032 --> 17:47.378
idols as far as officers. You'd say as far as, I 
mean, you'd go as far as saying that they were

17:47.560 --> 17:51.584
idols. Yeah.

17:55.208 --> 18:01.854
But I never dreamed ever going that high in the 
military. Really? No, I didn't. Why do you think

18:03.696 --> 18:05.037
that is? I don't know. I just, I really never 
thought about this parallel career in the

18:06.379 --> 18:13.766
military at that point. I don't think I really I 
don't think I really aspired to it. I

18:17.953 --> 18:25.422
guess it was so remote to think of World War II. It 
was so remote to think of all the reserve

18:25.442 --> 18:33.411
possibilities that did develop. It was just 
completely out of the realm of my aspirations,

18:33.431 --> 18:38.557
probably.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.584
In fact, when I got called to World War II, I assumed 
I'd be home in a year because I was called for a year.

18:50.522 --> 18:56.369
War hadn't started and I left home I told them I'd be 
back in a year. But as the thing went along and at the

18:57.410 --> 19:12.647
end of the year they kept the officers who were 
so-called more efficient the ones that were goal

18:57.410 --> 19:12.647
breaking and we used to say that we were penalized 
for being more efficient because they gave us

19:13.707 --> 19:41.655
orders to go on and and they turned loose some of the 
guys that were they wanted to be there and that

19:13.707 --> 19:41.655
always seemed a little unfair to me at the time but I 
think you understand that that's right that's the

19:13.707 --> 19:41.655
way it is that's right that's right at the time we 
said you know if they goof off they're gonna get to

19:13.707 --> 19:41.655
go home you know it's kind of unfortunate in a way uh 
in the service in that respect because when they

19:41.939 --> 19:57.223
get somebody that they can count on then they just 
overburden the guy with words at least I know from

19:41.939 --> 19:57.223
my experience in the enlisted corps but when they 
get somebody that goes wrong but then they don't

19:41.939 --> 19:57.223
even bother the guy that's what I'm trying to get 
rid of. And that's where you let them get out. Yeah

20:00.488 --> 20:05.236
but that that was a that was a strange thing we read 
it. I don't think I'd have wanted to be the only one

20:05.256 --> 20:09.162
that got out because The ones that got out, we said, 
you know, let them go. We're not interested in

20:13.473 --> 20:14.814
them. And if I'd have gone, I'd have had a feeling, 
you know, that they didn't really want me anyhow.

20:21.281 --> 20:24.705
Down deep, you don't want to be left out.

20:27.829 --> 20:30.051
Now, we've talked about things you liked about the 
car. Anything you disliked? Oh, I'm sure there

20:33.335 --> 20:35.858
was... you know it's not something I guess I can put 
my hand on though at the time I'm sure there were

20:36.817 --> 21:06.570
times that I'd probably rather been doing 
something else than cleaning the gun or getting

20:36.817 --> 21:06.570
the cosmoline off the rifle or digging the slit 
trench or something like that but it went along

20:36.817 --> 21:06.570
with it but as far as having a particular dislike I 
don't think I had any dislikes You know, there

21:07.327 --> 21:16.563
wasn't any, now that you think back on the Corps in 
the late 1930s, there weren't anything that you'd

21:07.327 --> 21:16.563
say, boy that should have been changed, it would 
have made it better. I don't really think so. It's

21:19.849 --> 21:32.170
uh, and I guess I'm comparing it to nowadays, it was 
so superior as far as I'm concerned, and the uh, the

21:19.849 --> 21:32.170
attitude that the fellas had, Today, I mean, 
comparing it today, you think it was superior back

21:33.500 --> 21:37.404
in the 30s than today. Well, I'm not that close to 
the core anymore, but a number of times you get the

21:37.424 --> 21:56.865
feeling that they just, some of them don't have the 
attitude

21:37.424 --> 21:56.865
of excellence that they used to have. Oh, really? 
Well, how do you get that feeling? I don't really

21:58.967 --> 21:59.688
know. And I think really... I relate it to the 
military and I'm letting it spill off back to the

22:03.925 --> 22:17.814
Coral because I'm certain as I'm sitting here that 
the military doesn't have it. The field ain't a

22:17.834 --> 22:19.237
vaccine. We're going to talk about the military. 
And I'm afraid that I let that filter back to the

22:25.188 --> 22:34.202
core, and it may be unfair, but I love to see that 
core. I love to watch them and all this. I hope I'm

22:37.046 --> 22:45.038
wrong, but you know, sometimes you generalize 
when you shouldn't. Do you think that the core had

22:47.021 --> 22:51.528
any effect on the fact that you became a leader? 
Yeah. How? Well, you saw people, you saw people who

22:55.563 --> 23:02.692
were, who were moving out ahead. You want 
something with me Lucille? You saw people who were

23:06.696 --> 23:22.836
moving out ahead, you'd see people who, first 
thing you know they were company commanders, they

23:06.696 --> 23:22.836
were corps commanders, they were cadet colonels,

23:24.588 --> 23:30.154
And when I see people that are excelling, I like to 
excel. And I think it gave me a feeling of, well,

23:31.455 --> 23:36.000
here's the way you do it. So it definitely had a 
place. It also gave me a feeling of...

23:52.769 --> 23:56.913
consideration of superiors, consideration of 
elders. Well, didn't you have that consideration

23:58.515 --> 24:01.658
from your parents? Yeah, but I'll tell you what, 
the military helped that. Yes, I had a very great

24:06.063 --> 24:17.175
feeling of obedience to my parents, but the 
military, you saw it every day. Somebody answered

24:17.976 --> 24:20.278
to everybody. and I could see from the early stages 
that the military was built on obedience and being

24:21.052 --> 24:36.533
able to carry out orders and to fulfill your 
responsibility. That's what the military is

24:36.553 --> 24:45.625
built on and that instilled with the background 
that I had then that instilled in me those things

24:36.553 --> 24:45.625
that You know, I think today are absolutely 
essential to a person who's going to succeed.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.144
A little interesting incident. I was a real good 
friend of General Rutter's. Do you know who

25:00.948 --> 25:04.993
General Rutter is? Being with the highway 
department and the position I had, we had a lot of

25:05.814 --> 25:12.321
common problems with the university. And I've 
been in many sessions with him personally. I

25:18.248 --> 25:23.315
remember one time I was referring to him as Mr. 
Rutter. I'd say, Mr. Rutter, so-and-so. He said,

25:25.117 --> 25:27.761
I'd love for you to call me Earl. He was a two-star 
general. At that time, I was probably a full

25:31.387 --> 25:35.613
colonel. He was several years my senior. I told 
him, I said, Mr. Rutter, there's no way that I could

25:38.657 --> 25:42.763
call you Earl. I said, first place, you're a senior 
to me in the military, and you're a senior to me in

25:44.127 --> 25:50.398
AIDS. I've got to call you Mr. Utter. He said, okay, 
but I just sent you to call me Earl. I could no more

25:56.369 --> 26:04.343
have called him Earl than I could have flown out of 
this window.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.928
Why didn't you call him General? Well, at that 
time, he was president of the university in

26:07.988 --> 26:13.576
civilian status. And whenever we were on military 
duty together, he was General Rudder. But I

26:18.023 --> 26:19.525
referred to him as Mr. Rudder.

26:22.930 --> 26:27.056
I tell you, it had been just like sticking a sword in 
me to have said Earl to him. Even though you had fine

26:28.939 --> 26:31.903
relations? Oh, absolutely. I had a great respect 
for him. And, you know, what he told me, I took for

26:39.209 --> 26:42.373
the gospel truth. But I couldn't call him Earl. I 
had never called a superior in the military by

26:46.517 --> 26:50.081
first name. He was always Colonel, General, 
Major. And I called him my boss. Every, I never

26:58.883 --> 27:02.627
called him anything but Mr. Lane. He was Mr. as far 
as I was concerned. And I couldn't call him Earl at

27:07.151 --> 27:09.814
all. He had a lot of my peers that were sort of on my 
level in other areas. I called him O.D. Butler. I

27:17.602 --> 27:22.807
called him Jocko Roberts and all this sort of 
thing. And he's my superior in rank and superior in

27:22.927 --> 27:25.950
age. He was Mr. as far as I was concerned. And that, I 
expect, probably changed the military. Yeah.

27:35.166 --> 27:38.711
Now, let's think back on your career for a minute. 
What way do you think that the Corps, besides what

27:39.812 --> 27:45.900
you just mentioned, that the Corps helped your 
career?

27:49.225 --> 27:57.456
Well, I think, of course appreciation for your 
fellow man. Right. And again, appreciation for

28:00.207 --> 28:06.979
being able to depend on somebody. I think that 
whole lot stemmed from the military. And being

28:11.968 --> 28:23.008
able to pick people that you could observe in their 
everyday operation for leaders in your

28:11.968 --> 28:23.008
organization.

28:25.435 --> 28:29.881
So, in other words, you could generalize from the 
military to the highway. That's right. Find men

28:31.723 --> 28:36.850
that you could depend on in your civilian 
occupation or people who could become future

28:31.723 --> 28:36.850
leaders. Yes, I think, I think, I think it gave you 
an ability to watch a person perform and see how you

28:47.845 --> 28:50.988
handle men. That's one of the things that the 
military always struck me is how you handle men.

28:58.176 --> 29:04.563
And a lot of people can do things themselves, but 
they can't handle men. They can't direct people.

29:06.665 --> 29:15.675
And you see a great deal of that in the military and 
out there, even though I was an officer in my senior

29:17.225 --> 29:21.170
year. If a man was tabbed as company commander, 
then he was in charge. And even though I was of a

29:28.358 --> 29:35.125
level with him, he was designated the man. And he 
had the responsibility. And what he told me to do,

29:38.429 --> 29:42.694
you know, I took it. He was given that 
responsibility. And that has spilled over in the

29:46.368 --> 30:00.243
highway business, or any other business, is that 
when an organization is set up and the man is

29:46.368 --> 30:00.243
appointed in charge, then that's the man that you 
look to. And even though he may not be any more

30:01.444 --> 30:15.058
educated, he may not be any more immediately 
capable, he's got something that somebody said to

30:01.444 --> 30:15.058
him, you're it. And that started in the military. 
It started in the Corps. Here's a man that's a

30:19.834 --> 30:27.503
platoon leader, here's a man that's a right guide 
or whatever, and you come on up, and here's the top

30:19.834 --> 30:27.503
man. He's been tapped. You could recognize that 
quality. You could recognize it. So those things

30:32.949 --> 30:36.112
started early in the Corps of Cadets. Now, as you 
think back, do you think that there's any way in

30:37.013 --> 30:45.282
which the Corps of Cadets might have hindered your 
career in any way? I don't know how it would have

30:45.852 --> 30:48.797
been. I sure don't know.

30:54.987 --> 31:04.962
Here would be, this would be the only thing that I 
could see, and I can't call that an interest now,

30:54.987 --> 31:04.962
had I not gone in the military. I don't know what my 
World War II status would have been.

31:11.654 --> 31:18.006
Let's just say that I had not been called and I had 
not been drafted for some reason. I had five more

31:18.928 --> 31:23.938
years of experience in my civilian occupation. I 
might have been five years further up the ladder.
