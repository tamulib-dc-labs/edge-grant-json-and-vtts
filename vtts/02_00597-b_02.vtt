WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:04.470
Okay, so he took you out to Watts. He showed me the 
condition and hired me, and it just was a miracle

00:04.530 --> 00:11.397
for me, because suddenly I have something to do. I 
can go out to clear slums,

00:12.638 --> 00:25.612
and put the zeal I would have put into the Methodist 
ministry into slum clearance. You can act on

00:25.692 --> 00:27.975
Christianity in a sound sound. Oh, absolutely. 
Monsignor O'Dwyer was really a practicing

00:30.575 --> 00:33.540
Christian. So was my father. But my father was 
ignorant. He didn't know the real world. O'Dwyer,

00:41.092 --> 00:46.381
through his charities, knew Los Angeles. Within 
three years, we had a housing authority

00:46.401 --> 00:49.506
established. We got the first projects built.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.139
And then the housing authority segregated them. 
one black, one brown, one white. This is 1942.

01:04.970 --> 01:13.042
There was no direction from the Supreme Court on 
the Constitutional question. That didn't come

01:13.062 --> 01:14.524
until 54. Even the Restrictive Covenant case 
didn't come down until 47. And O'Dwyer and I talked

01:21.613 --> 01:28.543
it over and felt it was just morally wrong for the 
projects to be segregated. And with the head of the

01:29.367 --> 01:44.822
League of Wimbledon, some liberal architects, 
and for the first time in our lives we set up a little

01:29.367 --> 01:44.822
picket line in front of the Housing Authority 
demanding that it integrate before it occupied.

01:46.424 --> 01:58.075
And within a few days the Housing Authority gave in 
and agreed and came out to the sidewalk where we

01:46.424 --> 01:58.075
were standing and in very mean words racist words, 
said they were going to integrate, and turned to

01:58.696 --> 02:07.484
O'Dwyer and said, who do you want to manage it? And 
O'Dwyer said, let's try Frank. So at the age of 28,

02:12.309 --> 02:25.902
from the picket line, I'm brought inside to become 
the manager of the first integrated housing

02:12.309 --> 02:25.902
project west of the Mississippi. And this whole 
thing that relates to the fact that it was that

02:29.864 --> 02:35.854
month, the first page, that we now have from the 
FBI. The first surveillance on me was a memorandum

02:37.337 --> 02:47.454
written by J. Edgar Hoover in 1942, deterring me to 
be a potential security risk. And from then on

02:48.135 --> 02:55.568
until 1980, everything in my life was 
orchestrated by the FBI, and I never knew it.

02:57.590 --> 02:59.493
That's a turning point in this whole thing. Maybe 
that's enough for you. No, I want to continue,

03:01.475 --> 03:04.119
unless you're too tired. I want to continue. I 
just... Do you want to take a break for a minute? No,

03:10.507 --> 03:11.328
I have the water. Okay. Would you... Times a 
quarter to three? I'd rather get it done with.

03:18.578 --> 03:21.903
Yeah, I'd like to... And rest my voice before I talk 
tonight. Yeah. Now, in Los Angeles, and in Watts,

03:24.168 --> 03:39.808
this Housing Council of Los Angeles, is this 
funded

03:24.168 --> 03:39.808
by public, private, or a combination of public and 
private funds? The Housing Council under

03:40.049 --> 03:44.054
Monsignor O'Dwyer was a private citizen group. 
Yeah, that's what I thought. The Housing

03:45.135 --> 03:50.662
Authority of the City of L.A. was set up by the 
federal government and state governments. It's a

03:50.823 --> 03:53.086
quasi-state corporation. Yeah. The funding came 
from the Wagner-Steagall Act of 1937,

03:54.222 --> 04:09.983
and from the Taft-Eleanor-Wagner

03:54.222 --> 04:09.983
bill of 1949. Let

04:11.725 --> 04:17.653
me just respond to questions. You wouldn't know 
any of this background, and you couldn't have

04:18.434 --> 04:24.162
questioned me on it, but now you know where I'm at. 
Yeah. You know the record a little bit from these

04:25.345 --> 04:28.069
other things. Yeah. Just let me respond to 
whatever you want. Okay, well, I want you to

04:30.271 --> 04:40.884
explain how well integrated housing and wants in 
World War II worked. What kind of problems did you

04:42.907 --> 04:44.188
have? It worked perfectly. We did not have 
problems. We... took people who had never had a

04:53.133 --> 05:06.608
flush toilet and gave them decent housing, and we 
completely overcame the argument that such

04:53.133 --> 05:06.608
people would turn the new housing into another 
slum. The projects were gardens, and we not only

05:07.529 --> 05:15.357
did good housing, but we did a lot of education. The 
Board of Education of L.A., for adult education

05:16.879 --> 05:22.785
for example, required an average daily 
attendance, I think, of twelve students, in order

05:23.761 --> 05:29.588
to justify a teacher. And I found out, when I'm 
managing these projects, that people would never

05:31.190 --> 05:46.109
come to a school or even the administration 
building for a class on, say, housekeeping,

05:31.190 --> 05:46.109
childcare. But the projects were built around 
central courtyards, where there'd be about

05:48.232 --> 05:53.278
sixteen families. And I got the Board of Education 
to allow a backyard, courtyard scene to be a

05:54.457 --> 06:01.947
classroom. And then all the mothers would come 
into a given kitchen to get a teaching lesson on

06:01.967 --> 06:10.158
cooking or sewing or whatnot. We became very, very 
much involved in basic education, political

06:11.740 --> 06:23.716
education.

06:23.736 --> 06:24.177
We I moved from the Ramona from the one project 
there in Watts. By the way, when the Watts

06:28.981 --> 06:31.144
Rebellion came in 65. I was going to ask you about 
that. The only place that didn't burn on 103rd

06:32.906 --> 06:37.071
Street was that project. That's interesting. 
There's a more complicated story in that, but I'll

06:39.494 --> 06:43.859
come back to it. I went up the ladder. I moved to the 
Ramona Gardens, which is a very, very much larger

06:46.322 --> 06:52.189
project. And I finally became assistant director 
of the Housing Authority in charge of the TAF

06:52.861 --> 07:04.116
program in 49, which gave us $110 million to spend. 
And I was given the job of selecting the sites and

07:04.216 --> 07:08.883
selling them to the city council. Yeah. At Ramona 
Gardens, where we had about a third Hispanic and a

07:10.805 --> 07:18.936
third black, we celebrated both Singletary Mile 
and Black History Week. This would be in the 40s,

07:26.850 --> 07:35.724
long before there was any sense of black or 
Hispanic consciousness and pride. We were doing

07:36.385 --> 07:38.368
it real, real early. I got Orson Welles and Rita 
Hayworth to come to Ramona Gardens to celebrate

07:39.169 --> 07:46.420
Singletary Mile. We had a Jewish and a Mexican and a 
black co-chair of Cinco de Mayo. And we tied it all

07:55.564 --> 08:05.581
together with the struggle against slavery in the 
States in the sixties. It was all combined

08:05.601 --> 08:08.826
educationally. The projects were beautifully 
maintained, and most of us in the work were

08:09.948 --> 08:16.699
committed. We had a zeal. It was not a nine-to-five 
job. I finally moved into the project because I

08:21.275 --> 08:26.680
didn't want to be an absentee. I wanted to live 
there at night. I wanted my kids to be brought up in

08:28.762 --> 08:33.666
the same place where I was asking other people to 
bring up their kids. So my kids were brought up in

08:34.186 --> 08:40.071
these projects in the old slum areas of L.A.

08:44.255 --> 08:46.737
The thing about the Watts jumps your way ahead.

08:49.703 --> 08:53.426
The influence we now know came from the FBI.

08:56.489 --> 09:04.397
They were very conscious of what was happening to 
me, and were beginning to maintain surveillance

08:56.489 --> 09:04.397
on me in the projects. We didn't know. We're 
getting the documents now. In 1952,

09:07.259 --> 09:16.588
without giving you all the circumstances, the FBI 
was able to get me fired from the Housing

09:17.243 --> 09:22.069
Authority. Yeah, we're going to talk about that. I 
want to talk about that. Let me just tell you the

09:24.532 --> 09:27.276
build-up on this thing. You see, civil liberties 
problems were bad in this country, especially

09:27.797 --> 09:45.259
from 45 to 49

09:27.797 --> 09:45.259
under Truman.

09:45.279 --> 09:45.900
But we had anti-communist oaths after the Smith 
Act of 1940. I have an absolutely lousy civil

09:51.668 --> 09:58.038
liberties record. I signed every loyalty oath 
they had. I swore I was not a communist. I each year

10:04.429 --> 10:12.141
took a special oath where we brought in the 
American Legion to stand with us with a battery of

10:04.429 --> 10:12.141
flags sign or oath that we would never overthrow 
the government by force and violence, whatever

10:13.184 --> 10:17.391
the oaths were. But by 1952, I had gone through 
changes. I'd watched the Un-American Activities

10:23.521 --> 10:39.367
Committee destroy the motion picture people in 
LA, and school teachers, and some knowledge I had

10:23.521 --> 10:39.367
of labor, and I was getting more and more critical 
of this idea. And I also was ready to regurgitate,

10:41.602 --> 10:44.326
literally. But once a year I suddenly have to prove 
I'm loyal by taking an oath and bringing in the L.A.

10:45.348 --> 10:59.329
Times to take a picture of me, signing, putting up 
my hand with the Legionnaires with their funny

10:45.348 --> 10:59.329
little hats. And I

10:59.349 --> 11:08.503
was in an eminent domain for seniors where the FBI 
did it. I was in an eminent domain proceeding on the

11:09.614 --> 11:25.675
necessity of taking Chavez Ravine, which is today 
the Dodger Ballpark, as the site for the larger

11:09.614 --> 11:25.675
project on the new ten thousand units that we were 
building. Thirty-five hundred units. It was

11:29.781 --> 11:38.052
designed by an architect friend that I live with, 
Richard Neutra, the most modern, designed to make

11:38.622 --> 11:46.051
it beautiful in those hills above L.A. And I was the 
expert. I knew all the correlations between bad

11:46.171 --> 12:02.229
housing and disease and delinquency, 
communicable disease, crime, the arguments you

11:46.171 --> 12:02.229
need to prove the necessity of taking private 
property for public use. And I'd been through ten

12:03.451 --> 12:07.195
trials in L.A. We won them all. And I was in one in 
August of 52.

12:15.343 --> 12:23.633
I'd been on the stand for a day of direct and then a 
day of cross-examination. And I knew every block.

12:27.557 --> 12:29.259
I knew the statistic. I was really professionally 
qualified to do what I was doing. Suddenly the real

12:33.444 --> 12:35.747
estate lawyers, owners, who were trying to block 
our access. They didn't want it taken because they

12:40.551 --> 12:50.764
did not want minorities brought into that part of 
L.A. And the restrictive covenant ruling ended up

12:40.551 --> 12:50.764
only coming down in 1947. And they called public 
housing socialized housing, creeping

12:52.066 --> 12:59.255
socialism, even though Senator Taft was the 
author. All kinds of reasons. And they were

13:03.020 --> 13:06.004
speculating on the land. to turn it into luxury 
apartments. And suddenly, in an ever-demanding

13:10.974 --> 13:18.700
proceeding, you've got to understand, hours, 
this block, that block, how do you know that? Where

13:19.200 --> 13:23.684
do you get your information on rat infestation and 
so on? They suddenly say, now, Mr. Wilkinson,

13:24.045 --> 13:36.615
would you please

13:24.045 --> 13:36.615
tell us all organizations, political or 
otherwise, that you belonged to since 1931?

13:39.317 --> 13:48.108
Totally

13:39.317 --> 13:48.108
irrelevant, immaterial question, except that 
was the summer of 1952. The Korean War was then in

13:48.188 --> 13:52.854
its second year.

13:55.917 --> 13:57.359
The Hollywood Ten were in jail. Alger Hiss was a bad 
guy. The Rosenbergs were due to be executed the

14:00.603 --> 14:03.226
following year. Red hysteria. Really hysteria. 
And my lawyer had been a radical, or more radical,

14:06.953 --> 14:16.567
back at UCLA days. In the 30s, probably. And now had 
become a Republican. And the Housing Authority,

14:20.633 --> 14:27.824
to protect itself, had hired all Republican law 
firms to represent us in the eminent domain

14:20.633 --> 14:27.824
proceeding. So when the question came, he could 
only think of me as he knew me. We'd never had any

14:32.811 --> 14:35.475
conversation about what had happened to me since. 
And so he thought to challenge the question on

14:37.379 --> 14:46.152
relevancy would be bad public relations. So he 
allowed me to answer. And I qualified myself as an

14:47.354 --> 14:55.446
expert witness, where I trained professional 
societies I belonged to. But then they pressed me,

14:55.486 --> 15:04.600
and now the political organizations, they didn't 
ask me, are you a communist? The political

15:04.920 --> 15:06.863
organizations And at that point, for the first 
time I reached that point, I said, I won't answer.

15:16.397 --> 15:18.799
And then my lawyer objected. And then the judge 
turned to the lawyer and said his objection was not

15:19.880 --> 15:24.744
timely. And he turned to me and he said, I think you 
need a lawyer. And I was suspended.

15:32.871 --> 15:37.575
And suddenly all hell broke loose in L.A. because 
we now know that J. Edgar Hoover, working with our

15:38.753 --> 15:52.465
chief of police, Parker, and with real estate 
interests, they were all working with Parker, had

15:38.753 --> 15:52.465
developed a dossier on me. We never knew this. And 
the dossier had been floating around town, and no

15:55.168 --> 15:58.811
one would touch it. It went to our Republican 
mayor, and I was working with him around the clock.

16:05.377 --> 16:08.440
I was five days on one telethon in the Chamber of 
Commerce building with the mayor. And they gave

16:13.589 --> 16:15.231
him this dossier. The chief went in to see him. And 
he looked at it and tore it up and said, I know this

16:17.533 --> 16:25.600
boy and I trust him. Get out of here. A year after I 
was suspended, Fletcher Bowen, this wonderful

16:29.804 --> 16:38.292
Republican mayor who I'd known as a child in my home 
My father, you know, my father helped to elect him,

16:38.626 --> 17:08.363
part of a reform against the prostitution and the 
gambling interests of L.A.

16:38.626 --> 17:08.363
Two nights before his election in 1953, Chief 
Parker, on television, with a member of the

16:38.626 --> 17:08.363
Un-American Activities Committee, Washington, 
came in and on television they said, now tell us

16:38.626 --> 17:08.363
about the relationship between Frank Wilkinson 
and the mayor, and all this public knowledge was

17:08.782 --> 17:10.745
brought out. And then the dossier was brought out. 
The first time I ever knew there was a dossier was

17:13.129 --> 17:18.457
nine months after it had been used. And it was read 
on television. I heard my dossier the first time

17:20.900 --> 17:23.825
read on television. It was ridiculous stuff. 
Today we laugh at it, but then it was scary. Tell me

17:31.116 --> 17:32.578
some of the stuff. I've been seen talking to a 
communist at the corner of 4th and Spring Street in

17:34.735 --> 17:45.529
Los Angeles that I had subscribed to the People's 
World newspaper.

17:48.753 --> 17:50.215
Yeah. All right. Was any of it true? I don't know 
about the communists at 4th and Spring Street. I

17:57.225 --> 17:59.107
would think it probably was true. And the 
subscription to the People's World, yes, it was

18:00.189 --> 18:04.354
true. I subscribed to everything. Yeah, so what? 
So what? At any rate, this was read, and then Chief

18:11.053 --> 18:21.103
Parker— In that, were you called a—did it say that 
you were a member of the communist power? Nothing

18:21.423 --> 18:31.252
in there said that I was a—the dossier didn't in any 
way suggest I had any communist connections. I

18:31.352 --> 18:32.974
just associated with the paper and people who were 
communists. See, in the 1940s, communists were

18:35.987 --> 18:39.693
people. They ran for office. They were even part of 
our housing council. All right. They then

18:50.571 --> 18:59.265
described, Parker described how he took it to 
Bowron, and Bowron tore it up and threw it in the

18:50.571 --> 18:59.265
wastebasket and told him to get out of his office. 
and this is all hammed up by the un-American guy.

19:03.529 --> 19:07.334
And they said, really, really, really? That's the 
man who's running for mayor tomorrow? All right,

19:11.499 --> 19:15.564
the election, Bowron would have gone in with 80%. 
He had a perfect record. He got something like 36%

19:17.646 --> 19:20.209
of the vote. And the new mayor came in, and within 
two weeks, turned over Chavez Ravine, where we had

19:20.750 --> 19:29.100
spent $7 million acquiring it. in developing it, 
turned it over to Walter O'Malley and the Brooklyn

19:30.380 --> 19:36.647
Dodgers for a ballpark for four million. One

19:36.667 --> 19:43.114
final point here that we'd forget if you just 
questioned me. One thing about how I did get

19:43.314 --> 19:47.779
connected with the Un-American Activities 
Committee. Yeah, we have to talk about that. My

19:50.222 --> 19:58.311
connection with that was entirely

19:50.222 --> 19:58.311
an accident.

20:03.708 --> 20:21.786
Unknowns to me, during the 40s, the Housing 
Authority, under a man named Howard Holsendorf,

20:03.708 --> 20:21.786
the executive director,

20:03.708 --> 20:21.786
had paid protection money to the California State 
Un-American Activities Committee. You could buy

20:21.806 --> 20:24.009
protection. A man named Hugh Burns was the state 
director, and he was given generous campaign

20:25.630 --> 20:31.757
contributions. And then he kept He

20:34.218 --> 20:40.427
prevented the Un-American Activities Committee 
from being attacked. I never knew it. Later I heard

20:45.233 --> 20:46.275
about this.

20:49.379 --> 20:58.251
When I was suspended, there was a move to bring in 
the Federal Un-American Activities Committee to

20:49.379 --> 20:58.251
investigate the housing authority.

21:01.488 --> 21:25.691
And because some of the right-wingers in L.A. knew 
of Olsendorf's connections with the State

21:01.488 --> 21:25.691
Committee and buying protection, Olsendorf 
called upon his friend in the State Committee to

21:01.488 --> 21:25.691
immediately hold a hearing on me to prevent the 
Federal Committee from coming in. And more than

21:27.312 --> 21:28.153
that,

21:33.078 --> 21:41.590
to get around the real estate people who were 
trying to bring in the Federal Committee to get rid

21:33.078 --> 21:41.590
of not me, but get rid of the Bolsendorf and the 
whole gang of them. And for that matter, to attack

21:41.610 --> 21:49.061
the State Committee for taking payoffs to protect 
groups.

21:51.745 --> 21:52.847
That I knew nothing about. I had injured my kneecap 
in a television program with Mayor Bowen six weeks

21:52.867 --> 22:01.279
before that. of these long televised programs, 
first years of television, were showing pictures

22:02.643 --> 22:11.493
of slums and talking about them to an audience. And 
he said, Frank, where is that one of the certain

22:12.635 --> 22:18.482
kind he particularly wanted to show? And it was in 
my briefcase across the room. And I

22:23.547 --> 22:27.452
hurried away from the camera to my briefcase to get 
that picture running back. And when I squatted

22:33.887 --> 22:39.453
down on my knee to get it, I split the cartilage into 
my kneecap. It's like football players get every

22:40.674 --> 22:43.277
weekend. You can almost get it with microsurgery 
nowadays, you can almost be back playing in six

22:44.498 --> 22:50.364
weeks. It was a little longer then. The housing 
authority, not telling me that they were bringing

22:52.507 --> 22:58.553
the Un-American Committee in on me, and yet 
feeling knowing i mean i had a marvelous record

23:00.693 --> 23:27.426
everybody i was very popular hundreds and 
hundreds of letters coming into the housing

23:00.693 --> 23:27.426
authority to defend me and the headlines for 30 
days in l.a were just wild headlines red plot to

23:00.693 --> 23:27.426
rule housing something like that and the housing 
authority said while we're working this thing all

23:27.760 --> 23:32.827
out, why don't you get your knee fixed? Because I 
was on salary, and I was suspended. So I checked

23:35.911 --> 23:48.208
into the Good Samaritan Hospital, Bolshevik 
Boulevard in L.A., same place where Bobby Kennedy

23:35.911 --> 23:48.208
died,

23:35.911 --> 23:48.208
and had surgery. While I'm under sodium 
pentothal, this is now told to me by the nurse's

23:50.552 --> 23:56.620
doctor, two federal or state or city police or 
marshal, somebody, people with badges, came to

23:58.743 --> 24:12.783
serve a subpoena on me in the hospital.

24:15.307 --> 24:17.530
And they were just told that I'm under surgery.

24:20.475 --> 24:27.585
And they waited outside of the surgery until I 
wheeled out in a gurney down a hallway into sort of

24:29.084 --> 24:34.171
have a period where you get recovery room of some 
sort. And they followed that in there and followed

24:35.913 --> 24:41.320
the nurses in there and said they wanted to talk to 
me as quick as they could. And they said he's

24:42.061 --> 24:44.204
unconscious. And they waited briefly and got 
impatient and went in, pushed the nurses aside and

24:45.966 --> 24:56.880
began to touch me on the shoulder and then shake me 
And the nurses screamed, and I clearly remember

24:58.312 --> 25:14.629
the screaming voices of the nurses, and something 
bright shining in my face, which was the badges of

24:58.312 --> 25:14.629
these FBI police agents, whatever they were. And 
they finally gave up. They took a safety pin, one of

25:17.612 --> 25:24.499
the nurses, and pinned the subpoena from UAC on my 
surgical gown. When I came out of recovery, I had

25:25.481 --> 25:27.863
been subpoenaed appear before the Un-American 
Activities Committee.

25:42.599 --> 25:49.625
I'm

25:42.599 --> 25:49.625
seventy-two now, and I'm traveling all over the 
country. Eighty percent of my audiences are under

25:51.287 --> 25:53.889
twenty-five. I'm trying to warn them about the 
revival of the new Un-American Activities

25:58.673 --> 26:07.145
Committee called the Senate Judiciary Committee 
on Terrorism, the new buzzword. And these

26:09.429 --> 26:14.596
students have no idea what the whole UAC was. I 
know. We abolished the Un-American Activities

26:15.698 --> 26:20.444
Committee in 75. That 22 year old student on this 
campus was 11. Yeah, I know. And I'm also trying to

26:24.762 --> 26:39.039
warn people that under Reagan's new guidelines 
from the FBI, which superseded wonderful

26:24.762 --> 26:39.039
guidelines we got from Gerald Ford, after 
Watergate, the FBI was stopped. Gerald Ford did

26:39.960 --> 26:40.942
it. And we had that for six years. Now under 
Reagan's guidelines, they put hidden

26:44.226 --> 26:52.896
microphones into undercover agents to go into the 
churches Bible study classes in Arizona, in

26:53.416 --> 26:57.060
Tucson. The old trial there, sanctuary movement, 
is based upon hidden microphones, intrusive

26:57.080 --> 27:05.049
techniques that Reagan guidelines allow. I'm 
warning them about this, and telling the story

27:05.710 --> 27:11.596
about the old FBI. They have no idea about, if you 
ask them who J. Ed Gruber was, that is fourteen

27:11.616 --> 27:18.544
years ago. They were then eight. You don't have to 
tell me. All right, I'm just telling you a little

27:22.494 --> 27:23.976
bit. I teach recent American history, and when I 
do, it's amazing. It's amazing. I teach

27:30.286 --> 27:36.055
McCarthyism and the Red Scare, and when I teach 
that, they look at me like I'm from the moon. Right.

27:37.217 --> 27:39.721
They can't believe the stories I hear. By the way, I 
have a case. You know I made a First Amendment

27:45.510 --> 27:49.596
challenge in the U.S. for ACLU? out of Georgia in 
1958. I served a year. Yeah, I know. I want to get to

27:55.200 --> 27:55.922
that. I want to get to that, but let's go first to 
1953, Citizens Committee to Preserve American

27:57.644 --> 28:05.657
Freedoms. All right. But before we do that, I want 
to welcome you. Okay. Let's continue. Now let's

28:12.829 --> 28:17.777
talk about the development of the Citizens 
Committee to Preserve American Freedoms.

28:22.364 --> 28:45.938
organization founded in Los Angeles in 1952

28:22.364 --> 28:45.938
in response to the repeated hearings in that area 
by both the federal and the state on American

28:22.364 --> 28:45.938
Activities Committee doing enormous damage to 
every aspect of cultural life in LA. It was founded

28:47.199 --> 28:50.464
by the retired director of of ACNU at that time, but 
also a retired minister, Reverend A. A. Heist. And

28:58.697 --> 29:08.672
it was a small group of liberals that did not think 
about abolishing these committees, but were

28:58.697 --> 29:08.672
trying to defend the victims. When the hearings 
were held from then on, we tried to get the

29:11.076 --> 29:18.207
subpoenaed people together before they fell 
apart and began thinking their best friend was an

29:19.807 --> 29:25.874
informer. And help them get cheaper no-cost 
lawyers and develop public relations things that

29:27.976 --> 29:49.780
would improve community reaction to a UI hearing 
and maybe save jobs. The best example I can give you

29:51.380 --> 30:03.657
is in 1956 when the committee came to L.A. and 
subpoenaed 56 members of the Musicians' Union.

30:06.161 --> 30:07.984
There was always a reason. Of course, they claimed 
they were investigating a law. What was really

30:11.609 --> 30:20.982
going on is that there had been a Jim Crow local in 
Hollywood, and so the prime jobs went to whites.

30:22.042 --> 30:24.504
killed it down, then the black musicians could get 
in. And black and white unions, progressive

30:25.485 --> 30:30.830
unions, decided to have one local for all. And they 
brought in UAC to kill off the

30:31.791 --> 30:37.496
anti-discrimination group. When that happened, 
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American

30:38.857 --> 30:44.342
Freedoms had developed such a reputation. 
Citizens were served, we'll say, on a Thursday

30:45.723 --> 30:51.728
morning at 7 a.m.

30:53.108 --> 31:04.602
By that night, we had all 56 subpoenaed people in 
our office with an ACLU lawyer and some community

30:53.108 --> 31:04.602
support to talk how we could fight back. The 
creativity that comes out of these meetings was

31:06.164 --> 31:09.168
unbelievable. They found they had practically a 
full symphony orchestra amongst them except a

31:10.149 --> 31:16.016
piccolo player. They decided the night before the 
hearing they'd have a symphony concert made up

31:23.382 --> 31:26.625
entirely of subpoenaed musicians. And they did. 
They raised money to take a large hall seating

31:30.009 --> 31:41.041
sixteen hundred people, and they got a visiting 
cellist to come in and do a concerto. And they took

31:43.003 --> 31:51.972
out two or three thousand dollars worth of ads in 
the LA Times and all the

31:53.150 --> 32:06.662
The ad was a picture of an English horn, and then 
they had little Sherlock Holmes characters with

31:53.150 --> 32:06.662
spy glasses going around through the horns of the 
values, looking for spies. And the ad was

32:07.743 --> 32:15.469
entitled, Force and Violins, and then come to the 
concert. When that thing was over, not one

32:17.131 --> 32:22.195
musician lost their job. Dorothy Chandler, wife 
of the editor of the LA Times, the main patron of the

32:22.748 --> 32:36.902
LA Symphony, her four favorite musicians, 
including her first oboist or something, were

32:22.748 --> 32:36.902
called. And she defended them all, wouldn't allow 
any of them to be fired, because they were just fine

32:38.023 --> 32:43.529
musicians.

32:46.291 --> 32:47.453
That's your question. It was founded in 1952. I was 
blacklisted. I guess that's the word. How did you

32:55.931 --> 32:58.694
find out that you were blacklisted? Well, you get 
instant notice of that from the public that

32:58.714 --> 33:05.260
afternoon. It was in August of 28. For two months, 
the LA Times, Herald, all of them were just filled

33:10.966 --> 33:17.553
with these wild and scary headlines. You would 
sometimes be interested in seeing a scrapbook of

33:18.794 --> 33:22.978
two months of headlines. Every day, my picture, my 
name, everything was all over the papers. And I

33:30.829 --> 33:34.134
became totally unemployable. The Citizens 
Committee was founded in September of 52, but I had

33:35.075 --> 33:40.542
no connection with it. I went until the spring of 53 
without any kind of a job.

33:51.865 --> 33:57.471
was called before the committee as a school 
teacher. She taught social studies for 13 years in

33:57.511 --> 34:01.956
the LA City school system. Very, very popular, 
very successful teacher. And she was fired

34:07.441 --> 34:15.750
because she refused to answer questions of the 
committee on the grounds of husband-wife

34:07.441 --> 34:15.750
privilege conversations. It was guilt by me, 
through me, that they got her out. So we had no

34:19.814 --> 34:21.636
income coming in. Finally, in June of 53, a

34:23.050 --> 34:50.475
Quaker family in Pasadena that owned a large 
department store

34:23.050 --> 34:50.475
called me and met me privately and arranged for me 
to be the sole janitor on a three-story department

34:23.050 --> 34:50.475
store that they had, coming in an hour after the 
store closed because they didn't think anyone

34:23.050 --> 34:50.475
should see me coming. and I was not to tell anybody 
that I was working for them. And they gave me a

34:55.477 --> 35:06.729
dollar an hour from six thirty in the night until 
four thirty in the morning to clean three, three

34:55.477 --> 35:06.729
floor hardwood departments. All the showcases, 
sixteen toilets, vacuuming, the work. Horrible,

35:13.536 --> 35:16.078
horrible, horrible experience for me. The peak of 
my, my job at those When I was fired, my job in

35:19.058 --> 35:22.423
today's money was around $65,000. Yeah. And then 
suddenly I'm dead. I was getting a buck an hour to be

35:27.470 --> 35:30.715
a janitor. At that point. Why'd they hire you? 
Quaker family. Yeah. Quakers were the best.

35:39.848 --> 35:48.441
Robert Hutchins, Hallert Hoffman, the son of Paul 
Geoff, an Eisenhower's

35:39.848 --> 35:48.441
cabinet member. Robert Hutchins of the former 
Chicago heard about me and came, they were active

35:48.995 --> 36:00.033
in the AFSC in Pasadena, and they came and helped 
me.

36:02.877 --> 36:08.787
The YMCA of Hollywood refused to let my children go 
to summer camp that first summer. My Sunday school

36:10.730 --> 36:12.673
superintendent came He was the director of the 
YMCA, but he had been my assistant director. My

36:20.047 --> 36:22.649
kids had gone every year for four years or 
whatever. He came and said, they've been trying

36:23.530 --> 36:28.975
and trying, and he finally got a compromise. They 
let my kids come if my wife and I would not bring them

36:28.995 --> 36:44.550
to the Y on Saturday morning, and if we would not 
come up the following Sunday to the campsite in the

36:28.995 --> 36:44.550
mountains for chapel services. And if I'd get a 
private doctor to check them over, because the

36:45.728 --> 36:54.476
doctor at the Y said he would not see my kids. At that 
point, the Quakers called me and offered me free

36:56.618 --> 37:03.865
family camp.

37:07.028 --> 37:09.991
Very good attitude, the Quakers and Pasadena at 
that time. I'm not giving you a card, but I'm just

37:10.432 --> 37:13.495
saying Quakers. Nixon was a Quaker. Anyway,

37:15.310 --> 37:42.938
in the summer of 1953, Reverend Heist and the new 
director of ACNU, Easton Monroe,

37:15.310 --> 37:42.938
and two or three other people, members of that 
Citizens Committee, came to me and said they

37:15.310 --> 37:42.938
wanted me to become the secretary of the Citizens 
Committee to Preserve American to help defend the

37:43.745 --> 37:45.787
victims of UAC. And I turned him down cold. Said 
that anything I would touch, I'd destroy. The

37:53.215 --> 37:59.883
committee could never be effective if I were any 
way associated with it. And they argued exactly

38:02.105 --> 38:04.208
the opposite.

38:07.531 --> 38:11.035
And took some arguing, because I really felt that. 
was only when the ACLU director in this miniature

38:11.622 --> 38:22.094
really said they knew that my organizing skills 
would be just wonderful for it. And they also felt

38:23.735 --> 38:30.563
that nobody knows what is a victim of UI, except the 
victim of UI. Fight back. So I went to work for them.

38:35.909 --> 38:38.592
And that became my job. Within two years, we turned 
it from just the victims to a long-range campaign

38:38.875 --> 38:44.283
to abolish. And by 1960, we

38:46.105 --> 38:53.696
set up a national committee to abolish. And in 
1958,

38:55.238 --> 39:06.233
my reputation, the committee's reputation, but 
my personal reputation of being able to go into any

38:55.238 --> 39:06.233
town

39:09.672 --> 39:14.359
and organized subpoenaed people into a fight 
back. Became nationally known. I was flying to

39:16.282 --> 39:27.579
Chicago, flying to Boston, flying to San 
Francisco, Gary, Indiana, and 20 I got a call to

39:16.282 --> 39:27.579
come down to Atlanta. I'd never been in the South. 
And I went down there to circulate a petition among

39:30.304 --> 39:37.755
church people, not to abolish UAC, but to keep it 
out of the South. arguing that it was hard enough to

39:38.528 --> 39:48.702
have dialogue between black and white without

39:38.528 --> 39:48.702
having one side labeled a communist. Sure. Long 
answer, that's the answer. That committee lasted

39:53.888 --> 40:00.177
up until we formed the National Committee to 
Avalanche Your Act. And is that when, when you went

40:00.197 --> 40:07.827
to Atlanta, is that when you were cited for 
contempt of court? August of 58. It was at that

40:11.652 --> 40:14.616
time, we never knew how it happened. I did not know I 
was going down to Atlanta until the day before. Got

40:18.681 --> 40:26.030
a telegram, meet people in Atlanta, worked with 
Martin Luther King Sr. and others. And I made a

40:28.013 --> 40:36.463
plane reservation, flew down, and it had been a 
minute after I checked into the hotel where they

40:28.013 --> 40:36.463
told me to come. I was subpoenaed to appear before 
UI. We thought it was just the Un-American

40:40.173 --> 40:45.621
Activities Committee following me, following 
everybody, everywhere. And we learned just this

40:47.143 --> 40:59.282
last year that they had me under, they had eight 
agents following me from seven in the morning till

40:47.143 --> 40:59.282
ten at night, all my conversations wiretapped, 
everything. They knew everything about where I

40:59.743 --> 41:05.792
was going, what I was doing, and were trying to 
disrupt my work. The real disruption didn't begin

41:06.397 --> 41:09.261
until the early 60s. The COINTELPRO of FBI didn't 
begin until 56. In Georgia, it was 58. At any rate, I

41:14.887 --> 41:20.034
made a—ACID wanted a witness. They'd been trying 
for five years to get somebody who would not claim

41:21.015 --> 41:30.166
the privilege of the Fifth Amendment to make a 
First Amendment challenge. And I had been

41:30.286 --> 41:31.288
looking. No one was willing to do it because I was 
almost sure to go to jail. we all felt that somebody

41:36.923 --> 41:38.886
should do it. As a matter of conscience, we wanted 
the issue raised. And there were some inklings in

41:43.894 --> 42:02.562
the dicta of some of the Warren Court decisions 
that implied that they might consider taking on

41:43.894 --> 42:02.562
the Un-American Activities Committee on First 
Amendment grounds.

42:02.582 --> 42:02.762
Go ahead. And so you were subpoenaed in front of 
HUAC. Now, originally, you were down there to help

42:06.525 --> 42:19.380
with the beginnings of the civil rights program, 
correct?

42:19.400 --> 42:30.072
First time I ever went to Georgia, first time I ever 
went to the South, was when I came down in July of 58

42:19.400 --> 42:30.072
and was subpoenaed. The civil rights thing in 
Montgomery had begun in 54. Yeah, right. From then

42:35.142 --> 42:54.065
on, I became involved in the Civil Rights program 
in the South, but all in connection with the

42:35.142 --> 42:54.065
way the Un-American Activities Committee was 
being used as a bulwark for segregation. Right,

42:54.085 --> 42:55.406
right. Martin King,

42:55.427 --> 43:04.137
there's a picture of us together there, that's at 
Morehouse College. After the court decision came

43:04.825 --> 43:20.165
down and we'd exhausted our appeals and we were 
going to jail, he and Coretta King had a reception

43:04.825 --> 43:20.165
for Carl and me at Morehouse College the night 
before we went to jail. And 400 black leaders were

43:21.186 --> 43:25.071
sat out there to honor us as we went to jail. And

43:26.673 --> 43:34.123
I don't think I've ever seen the newspaper 
clipping on it. because I went right into jail. But

43:38.670 --> 43:44.175
his statement was extremely important 
historically. He said that we're honoring these

43:44.195 --> 43:46.677
men. He said, these men are going to jail for us.

43:53.362 --> 44:02.390
We will never achieve peaceable integration in 
the South until the Un-American Activities

43:53.362 --> 44:02.390
Committee has been abolished. And then we went on 
to jail. When

44:06.284 --> 44:20.400
I was in jail, he and Reinhold Niebuhr and others 
started a petition for clemency to get us out,

44:06.284 --> 44:20.400
which Kennedy denied while we were in. On what 
grounds?

44:24.985 --> 44:26.066
Kennedy was no good.

44:30.832 --> 44:33.895
The Secretary of the World Council of Churches 
Chicago was his name, took this petition,

44:35.512 --> 44:46.104
launched by Martin Luther King, Jr., Reinhold 
Niebuhr, A.J. Muste, Dean John Bennett, Union

44:46.124 --> 44:53.292
Theological Seminary, really top, top people. 
Howard Schomer, S-C-H-O-M-E-R, your record will

44:53.733 --> 45:01.141
be the first time it's accurate. He was secretary 
of the World Council of Churches. He was on his way

45:03.929 --> 45:07.934
to New Delhi for a World Church Conference. He 
delayed it to deliver these 3,500 names to

45:07.954 --> 45:12.721
President Kennedy. And when he went down there to 
see him, Kennedy would not even meet the

45:13.883 --> 45:21.473
delegation, turned it over to his pardon 
attorney, who immediately rejected it. And of

45:24.016 --> 45:28.342
course, we now know the records, you see. The 
moment I went into jail, The FBI's whole apparatus

45:32.583 --> 45:36.727
on me went into prison with me. They just sent me, 
two months ago, every letter that I wrote and every

45:36.747 --> 45:47.797
letter I received while I was in prison. These were 
all part of the file. They had surveillance on me.

45:51.441 --> 46:01.290
And we were moved around from prison to prison to 
prison as terrible harassment as political

45:51.441 --> 46:01.290
prisoners.

46:03.211 --> 46:13.885
The pressure on the Kennedys, Bobby and Jack, from 
the FBI was enormous there. Why do you think that

46:14.226 --> 46:15.227
was? I think Hoover, first of all, Hoover had no 
real mandate to do what he was doing. It was just

46:27.143 --> 46:32.290
something sort of an accretion, a collection of 
power given to him at the budget hearings each

46:34.953 --> 46:42.120
year, beginning with Harlan Stone back in 1924 
through Roosevelt.

46:46.665 --> 47:01.720
And Hoover had adverse information on the sex and 
the financial,

46:46.665 --> 47:01.720
every kind of dealing that would either be 
illegal, or corrupt, or immoral, or bad PR. He had

47:10.055 --> 47:11.016
it on them all. When I, the decision came down in the 
60th term of the court, beginning of 58, take your

47:11.337 --> 47:29.040
time, February 28th, my attorneys, Roland Watts, 
the National ACNU, and Nanette Dembitz, who was

47:30.725 --> 47:43.114
The niece of Justice Brandeis, who was writing the 
briefs on my case, they filed appeal after appeal

47:30.725 --> 47:43.114
to delay my jailing as long as they could.
