WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:03.793
This is August 4th. This is Bob Cornish, and we are 
in the office of Don Sweeney, the interim dean of

00:04.394 --> 00:11.444
the College of Architecture and Environmental 
Design. Don, could you go over some of your early

00:13.548 --> 00:21.179
experience and how you came to be in planning? My 
guess is probably sort of indirectly, but I think

00:22.581 --> 00:29.031
probably many of us do. I was involved in a master's 
degree program here in Texas A&M in health

00:31.064 --> 00:37.153
facilities architecture. I started off with an 
interest in medicine early on in my undergraduate

00:37.173 --> 00:48.389
program, realized that I was interested in health 
and not medicine, and the two are not necessarily

00:37.173 --> 00:48.389
related, I discovered. So I finished with a degree 
in English and along the way got to know a fellow on

00:49.430 --> 00:55.859
campus. What year was that? My class of 66. got to 
know a fellow who was a student here in the College

01:00.663 --> 01:10.757
of Architecture, just entering a master's 
program that was going to concentrate on health

01:00.663 --> 01:10.757
facilities research. So I entered that program as 
well because I was still interested in health and

01:11.357 --> 01:20.369
had always been interested in facilities. And 
that program studied

01:22.312 --> 01:27.880
health care delivery generally. We didn't just 
study facilities because Facilities are simply

01:30.211 --> 01:35.999
the three-dimensional manifestation of 
programmatic endeavors. So we were looking at the

01:36.760 --> 01:40.285
whole health care delivery system. And in fact, 
our whole modus operandi was systems-oriented.

01:45.151 --> 01:53.422
We took a very broad approach to problem solving 
under Gunther Schmidt's leadership, which you

01:45.151 --> 01:53.422
will recall, the Fuhrer. The Quintero, yes. Lord 
of the End. It was just natural for me anyway. I

02:00.316 --> 02:03.962
think I tend to be oriented that way anyway, 
naturally. And so I studied health facilities

02:05.564 --> 02:22.810
planning and design, got the master's degree, and 
worked for a while in New York City with the Health

02:05.564 --> 02:22.810
and Hospital Planning Council of Southern New 
York in their architectural debate. And I went to

02:22.830 --> 02:27.437
the Army to fulfill my obligation right in the 
middle of the Vietnam War. Two years of that and I

02:29.189 --> 02:31.891
came back. I was in Korea during that period. And I 
came back to pursue a doctorate. What year was

02:39.738 --> 02:40.479
that?

02:43.502 --> 02:44.603
I came back in 1970.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.769
I was interested in pursuing a doctorate in health 
facilities. I actually did a study for the World

02:52.570 --> 02:58.555
Health Organization on national health planning 
in developing countries. It started off to be a

02:58.805 --> 03:09.298
project on health facilities in developing 
countries, but it turned out that facilities are

02:58.805 --> 03:09.298
really not the issue. They have architects and 
engineers as good as ours. The problem was that the

03:12.943 --> 03:21.834
decision makers in those countries do not 
appreciate health as a valid point for investment

03:12.943 --> 03:21.834
of scarce resources. They tend to want to focus on 
industrial projects. instead of health and

03:27.323 --> 03:29.286
social services. So the point we were trying to 
make is that a very important key to overall

03:29.306 --> 03:37.416
development of the country is the health and 
social service infrastructure. And at that time,

03:39.720 --> 03:44.486
I was teaching in the Department of Architecture 
also. Actually, as I finished the degree, I took

03:46.248 --> 03:57.263
over from Gunter in the building systems program 
that he was in charge of. after he left for SUNY.

03:59.732 --> 04:13.050
Yes, and the health planning courses were in the 
process of being formed at that time by Joe

03:59.732 --> 04:13.050
Sprague. How did he spell his name? Sprague was 
here in the research center also, part of that

04:18.757 --> 04:24.364
research team. had a background in architecture 
and was responsible for developing four courses

04:25.070 --> 04:34.401
in college, two in architecture and two in 
planning. I had two courses in health facilities

04:34.421 --> 04:39.607
design and two in health planning. I inherited all 
those courses when he left. So I moved from systems

04:43.251 --> 04:51.280
to an orientation

04:43.251 --> 04:51.280
towards health facilities. And then to planning, 
I inherited those courses. And then I became dean

04:54.729 --> 04:57.072
assistant, dean for research. And when I went back 
to faculty full time, it was in the department of

04:57.092 --> 05:03.981
planning, looking after the health systems. What 
year was that?

05:09.628 --> 05:14.835
That was after Wolfgang became department head. I 
think he arrived in 75.

05:22.259 --> 05:23.721
I had to look at my resume. I really don't remember. 
But I went back full time on the faculty, working in

05:26.526 --> 05:31.634
the health systems program. All along, all 
through that time, I was consulting with health

05:33.156 --> 05:40.427
institutions and health and social service 
agencies. And also, I was very actively involved

05:41.148 --> 05:50.022
in the fiduciary capacity with regional boards 
and the regional planning commission. the state

05:50.356 --> 05:56.724
and federal agencies on various committees and 
task forces and boards. I was on the board of the

05:56.924 --> 06:01.490
American Health Planning Association. I was on a 
big national task force in health planning and

06:01.510 --> 06:13.244
health service construction for the National 
Institute of Health and AGW, I guess, some time

06:01.510 --> 06:13.244
ago. And also heads of NSF and a couple of firms in 
Washington and California. I was also involved

06:20.528 --> 06:29.098
in, have been involved with regional health 
planning in Texas in all of its eras. The first one

06:29.559 --> 06:41.233
was under Public Law 89-749, which was the 
Comprehensive Health Planning Act of 66, which

06:29.559 --> 06:41.233
Texas got into in the late 60s, early 70s. Who was 
governor

06:41.373 --> 06:46.739
of? Riscoe, I think. Actually, it was Smith in 
Nebraska. We had some health planning projects

06:53.640 --> 07:05.312
with the state health planning agency in the old 
research center, and I got involved with it during

06:53.640 --> 07:05.312
that era. Then the subsequent, so I served as a 
member of the regional health planning advisory

07:05.332 --> 07:17.805
council in finding a charity for seven years, and 
then I got involved with regional alcoholism and

07:05.332 --> 07:17.805
drug abuse services planning, and I chaired that 
for seven years. And then I served on the statewide

07:23.737 --> 07:32.288
advisory council for the Texas Commission on 
Alcoholism and Drug Abuse for seven years. I

07:32.308 --> 07:39.837
served on the state advisory council for the 
Emergency Medical Services Division of Texas

07:32.308 --> 07:39.837
Department of Health for another four years. And I 
also chaired the regional emergency medical

07:41.759 --> 07:48.147
services planning group with the COG. So I've 
chaired three different advisory councils for

07:50.017 --> 07:59.189
the Regional Planning Commission one time or 
another. And I served as a board member on Humana

07:59.209 --> 08:06.199
Hospital in the rehab center and Blue Bonnet 
Psychiatric Center.

08:10.605 --> 08:16.092
And I'm on the board of the, I'm chairman of the 
board of Green Bay right now. I'm on the board with

08:16.561 --> 08:21.726
several different health and social service 
agencies.

08:24.529 --> 08:33.419
Aside from your work with outside agencies, when 
you came into the planning department, you had

08:24.529 --> 08:33.419
been there for a year or two, as I remember. And then 
we hired a part-time faculty member to help you.

08:42.708 --> 08:45.071
And I can't remember your name. Sharon Rothman. 
How do you spell her last name? R-O-T-H-M-E-L. She

08:48.636 --> 08:52.260
was quite good, as I recall. She had a background in 
planning. And she had a degree in planning. And she

08:56.725 --> 09:02.492
had worked professionally

08:56.725 --> 09:02.492
as a health planner in Utah. And she left because 
her husband left. That's right. Do you remember

09:07.698 --> 09:14.906
the day she joined us and left? No, I don't. That 
would be, it's a matter of record here at the

09:17.834 --> 09:22.923
university, somewhere, if we can find it. We'll 
have to add it later. During that period, the

09:26.169 --> 09:35.124
health planning program typically would run 
about six or seven students, and there were some

09:26.169 --> 09:35.124
very fine students. Dan Yazak was one. He's up in 
Montana still, I believe. Yeah, he's an

09:40.172 --> 09:46.580
administrator, hospital administrator at 
Shodare Children's Hospital now, doing very

09:40.172 --> 09:46.580
well. Mark McConathy, who did a master's and then a 
Ph.D. Another person who did that was Nora

09:46.600 --> 09:56.672
Smith-Cox. Nora Smith-Cox, who is now in 
Wisconsin. She has both a master's and a Ph.D. and

10:03.025 --> 10:10.137
there were several others who were very fine and 
who had done well in the health plan field.

10:10.238 --> 10:26.586
Wischmick, Frances Wischmick, she went through 
the health plan program and worked in that field

10:10.238 --> 10:26.586
and may still be working in that field in New 
Jersey, I think.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.967
You know, those are notable. Marina Weiss took a 
doctorate here under Jim Gardner, but her areas

10:30.447 --> 10:40.442
were social services planning, and she took all 
the health planning courses. Very, very bright.

10:40.843 --> 10:46.251
Now a senior aide with Senator Vinson.

10:46.271 --> 10:54.042
Well, the program has sort of waxed and waned, 
depending upon sort of an irregular supply of

10:46.271 --> 10:54.042
students and projects. The conclusion that I've 
come to is that one person does not a program make.

10:59.585 --> 11:02.269
You really have to have more than just one person. 
And that's really all we had. For a long time I

11:04.872 --> 11:14.425
taught the health plan courses and the health 
facilities courses in the college and really

11:04.872 --> 11:14.425
maintained that health emphasis both in 
architecture and planning alone. George Mann has

11:15.467 --> 11:23.758
been very active in health facilities in 
particular and has taken those courses in

11:15.467 --> 11:23.758
architecture. I think it's a very important part 
of the planning program.

11:30.726 --> 11:45.941
There certainly are opportunities, 
particularly in the health sector now, when

11:30.726 --> 11:45.941
health institutions are becoming more and more 
involved in the application of business

11:30.726 --> 11:45.941
technology and basic business practices to the 
delivery of health services. Just a few years ago,

11:47.042 --> 11:54.589
it would have been obscene to see a full page ad in a 
newspaper from a hospital, but now it's fairly

11:47.042 --> 11:54.589
typical. And you see ads and et cetera, cut rate 
specials, so to speak, for surgery, on and on. So

12:04.260 --> 12:13.950
what we're seeing is that in an era of great and 
increasing competition, the health

12:04.260 --> 12:13.950
institutions are also very heavily regulated. So 
they don't really have the area of price

12:13.970 --> 12:18.094
competition. They have to find other ways to 
compete. So it's very important that they plan

12:19.656 --> 12:23.180
effectively. So strategic planning. That's the 
current buzz word. And the health sector is very

12:28.029 --> 12:30.016
important. It's now that sometimes they're 
absolutely committed to it. They were forced into

12:33.708 --> 12:37.300
it by the circumstances of the marketplace. But 
also by regulation, there are various agencies

12:37.685 --> 12:42.531
that require that they have plans. The health 
planning system of the federal government

12:42.551 --> 12:47.176
requires that. Of course, that's dormant in 
Texas. It's not operational at all. Could you go

12:50.781 --> 12:52.623
into the history of that a bit? I think that's 
particularly interesting in terms of the

12:52.643 --> 13:04.878
regional health planning sectors of Texas and 
their history and where we are now and where we have

12:52.643 --> 13:04.878
been. Well, I think that Texas, in some ways, has 
been a precursor of what has happened nationally

13:08.684 --> 13:17.197
in the area of health planning, regional health 
planning in particular. The public law on 93-641,

13:18.419 --> 13:29.496
the National Health Planning and Resource 
Development, 74, mandated a nationwide health

13:18.419 --> 13:29.496
planning system. It mandated heavy 
participation by citizens, consumers in

13:30.117 --> 13:35.265
particular. gave the numerical edge on all the 
policy-making bodies to the consumers, as

13:35.853 --> 13:42.399
opposed to the providers of health services. And 
it was very, I think, interestingly organized. It

13:48.365 --> 14:05.202
was implemented, however, both in Texas and I 
think nationally, with too heavy a hand by some of

13:48.365 --> 14:05.202
the planning zealots and the consumer advocates, 
to the extent that they ultimately alienated the

13:48.365 --> 14:05.202
participants in the traditional political arena 
of the health sector. That arena has been

14:10.058 --> 14:21.299
dominated by what's called a very cozy triangle 
between health providers and health regulators

14:10.058 --> 14:21.299
and health bureaucracy and then politicians. So 
that when the consumers were thrown in the middle

14:22.421 --> 14:25.907
of that, They screwed up all the relationships. 
They were irreverent. They didn't make any deals

14:32.039 --> 14:34.401
with anybody. They asked silly questions. And it 
really screwed everything up. So ultimately, it

14:38.606 --> 14:41.550
was just a... Probably resented by the health 
providers. They were heavily resented by

14:43.151 --> 14:44.853
everybody. And they asked silly, naive questions 
about things that couldn't be answered very well.

14:52.362 --> 14:56.687
For instance, in Texas, the state was divided up 
into 12... health service areas, like super COG

14:58.135 --> 15:04.545
areas. The one that we were in included the service 
areas for BEDC, CAPCO, and SITCOG, and HOTCOG.

15:14.079 --> 15:14.961
Four COGs. Four COG areas all together in one big 
super region. Of course, these are The cog areas

15:19.921 --> 15:24.587
are in the main, I think, fairly functional 
regions. And they do, in fact, describe regional

15:24.607 --> 15:27.130
behavior. I mean, Brazos Valley, believe it or 
not, College Station is the cultural hub. And

15:32.197 --> 15:36.583
College Station Bryan and in HGAC, it works that 
way. That, in fact, is fairly a good description of

15:36.743 --> 15:40.728
the region. Central Texas Cog, the Harbor Texas 
Cog, Capital Area, ACOG, et cetera, they really

15:40.748 --> 15:49.860
are fairly well circumscribed. take all these 
groups and throw them into one big pot and say,

15:50.549 --> 15:59.021
here, now you're a region of four COG areas, it 
doesn't work. I chaired the steering committee

15:59.041 --> 16:10.777
that wrote the application for designation for 
that Central Texas Health Service area for the new

15:59.041 --> 16:10.777
health main body that we had created, the Health 
Systems Agency. The HSAs, the Health Systems

16:10.797 --> 16:19.189
Agencies, were quite powerful as opposed to their 
predecessors. voluntary health planning

16:19.422 --> 16:24.107
agencies called 314 agencies. They just depended 
upon voluntary participation at the COG level.

16:29.513 --> 16:32.136
And they didn't have any authority over dollars. 
But the HSAs were organized as private and

16:33.257 --> 16:39.083
for-profit corporations, most of them. And they 
had policy-making authority, and they had

16:39.103 --> 16:46.932
control of the budget of many millions of dollars 
of health money. Well, that attracted great

16:47.705 --> 16:49.407
attention. So whereas in the past, the advisory 
boards of the 314 agencies had been made up of

16:49.447 --> 17:04.404
consumers and others sort of voluntarily going 
along with things. When these new agencies

17:05.244 --> 17:14.775
developed, there was a great deal of competition 
to make sure that you were on the board, you were

17:05.244 --> 17:14.775
represented somehow, and your hospital needed to 
be represented. at saying your agency needed to be

17:15.110 --> 17:20.777
represented and your professional association 
needed to be represented. So it was quite an

17:21.598 --> 17:23.621
experiment. They developed health plans for the 
regions that were very complicated and very

17:24.282 --> 17:31.991
difficult to do. Some of our health plan graduates 
participated in that all over the state of Texas.

17:36.577 --> 17:41.944
Some of them actually ran the agencies.

17:42.582 --> 17:45.205
And they did things that make sense in terms of 
regional planning. For instance, you have a

17:45.265 --> 17:54.456
region and you have a comprehensive health plan, 
you would expect that all that various health

17:45.265 --> 17:54.456
components would fit into that. Even if they were, 
even if there were state agencies, they ought to

17:54.476 --> 17:58.641
fit into that. They're serving that area. So, and 
in fact that's what occurred. So it happened that

18:01.925 --> 18:09.754
all the state agencies that have health programs, 
and there are over, almost 30 of them that do, had to

18:09.920 --> 18:15.369
be their plans and their activities had to be 
consistent with the health plan of the region. Now

18:15.389 --> 18:17.452
that makes sense in terms of planning. It's 
dynamite politically. So when the Texas

18:19.815 --> 18:29.811
Commission on Alcoholism was developing their 
regional plans, they had to bring them before the

18:19.815 --> 18:29.811
HSAs, the health service areas, to be blessed. And 
if they didn't get blessed, they had to go back and

18:29.831 --> 18:32.776
fix them until they were. Now that makes sense in 
terms of planning. It's rational. It's totally

18:38.827 --> 18:39.888
rational. On the other hand, these agencies 
weren't used to having anybody else look over

18:40.248 --> 18:43.912
their shoulders. And they hated it. So the 
agencies were alienated, the bureaucracy. The

18:50.338 --> 18:58.787
politicians were alienated because these 
agencies, as nonprofit corporations, were not

18:50.338 --> 18:58.787
beholden to them. The governor couldn't control 
them. The mayors couldn't control them. They

19:03.651 --> 19:08.496
looked more to Washington than they did to Austin 
for their sustenance. And so they were... Shades

19:10.098 --> 19:11.900
of the model cities program. Yeah, it was almost, 
you could say, doomed from the start. The

19:16.327 --> 19:22.936
providers didn't like me either because of these 
complicated consumers who kept asking silly

19:16.327 --> 19:22.936
questions. Were they really silly? No, they 
weren't silly at all. They were questions that

19:27.403 --> 19:32.370
they had difficulty answering. Probably too 
common sense oriented. Not technically, I don't

19:36.539 --> 19:38.141
know. I don't mean to defame the providers 
necessarily. There were a lot of enthusiastic

19:42.024 --> 19:43.886
participants. But

19:43.906 --> 19:56.238
when White came into office, although he had run on 
one of his planks was that he was going to save

19:43.906 --> 19:56.238
health planning. In fact, he allowed the 
continued degeneration of the health planning

19:56.258 --> 20:06.107
system that had been started by his predecessor, 
wild bill. And it was under White's regime that all

20:09.841 --> 20:18.695
the federal funding was jerked by the state. And 
they were, in fact, they were all wiped out. It was

20:22.201 --> 20:24.244
all over. And I think it was a very sad thing. Now we 
see in Texas a resurgence of voluntary regional

20:28.551 --> 20:35.622
health funding back to the COG level again. You 
don't have to participate, but it would be good if

20:36.074 --> 20:39.820
you did, et cetera. And I chair that committee here 
in the region. So the pendulum is swinging back.

20:47.733 --> 21:00.614
Well, Don, at one time, as I remember locally here, 
when Humana was thinking of building a new

20:47.733 --> 21:00.614
hospital, St. Joseph's effectively blocked it 
for quite a long time. They did it through the

21:00.674 --> 21:02.156
health planning system. OK. And what mechanism 
did the health planning system have? Well, the

21:09.812 --> 21:20.945
idea was that in order to control costs that were 
rapidly increasing in the health sector, you had

21:09.812 --> 21:20.945
to control capital investment. And if you could 
control capital investment, then you could

21:20.965 --> 21:25.250
control this expansion. So the idea was that if you 
wanted to expand your facility, Or if you wanted to

21:29.382 --> 21:36.852
add a new facility or add a new service, you had to 
get what was called a certificate of need from the

21:29.382 --> 21:36.852
state. Not a certificate of demand, but a 
certificate of need. You had to show that the

21:39.836 --> 21:44.622
community that you served, in fact, needed what 
you wanted to do. Well, through that mechanism...

21:44.642 --> 21:47.666
That came from which organization? Well, in Texas 
it was split. You would think that would be under

21:50.910 --> 21:54.495
the group that's involved with implementation 
plans. But in fact, there was a new health agency

21:54.796 --> 22:11.861
created by the legislature called the Texas 
Health Facilities Commission, which was not at

21:54.796 --> 22:11.861
all, was not in any way associated with the health 
department or with the health planning, state

21:54.796 --> 22:11.861
health planning. So it was crazy. And by 
definition, the commissioners of the Health

22:13.884 --> 22:22.356
Facilities Commission could not have had any 
prior experience with health facilities. I was

22:22.876 --> 22:24.998
really nuts. Anyway, so you had to go before this 
group and

22:26.200 --> 22:34.930
it was like a hearing. In fact, it was exactly what 
it was. They had a hearing and all the testimony had

22:36.352 --> 22:40.417
to be entered verbally. There was nothing written 
that was accepted. And you had to get up and present

22:42.879 --> 22:45.983
your case. Humana argued that this area would 
continue to grow and that we needed additional

22:46.023 --> 22:52.731
beds. general acute care and we also needed 
general additional beds for pediatric and OB and

22:53.183 --> 23:11.632
St. Joseph's argued the counter because it was not 
to their best interest for there to be increased

22:53.183 --> 23:11.632
competition.

23:13.895 --> 23:19.444
That went on for about four years and the first time 
it came to the ruling The commission ruled in favor

23:20.183 --> 23:25.810
of St. Joseph's totally and turned down Humanity 
completely. So St. Joseph's was allowed to expand

23:25.910 --> 23:32.899
its OB and add new beds, and Humanity was not 
allowed to do anything. Well, Humanity was

23:32.919 --> 23:35.582
furious, and they kept on fighting. And then right 
about the time that they finally won, the Texas

23:35.602 --> 23:45.895
Health Facilities Commission, six weeks later, 
went out of business. So it was a moot point anyway.

23:47.577 --> 23:49.279
So now they've built and have opened up. And the 
competition that we're seeing in the community, I

23:50.035 --> 23:53.239
think, is very healthy. And, of course, we now have 
Scott and White. Scott and White's here. They're

23:57.265 --> 24:00.890
doing very well in Greenleaf's building, 
Sandstone's building. What's happening is that

24:00.910 --> 24:05.616
we're seeing... We have a new building for the 
rehab center. Yeah. So we're seeing the

24:06.637 --> 24:15.209
development of the regional headquarters, the 
regional system, regional focus right here in

24:06.637 --> 24:15.209
Bryant College Station for health care. And it's 
going to be... It's just a pity, in my opinion, that

24:18.740 --> 24:30.953
It all didn't happen as a center, as a medical 
complex somewhere within the Metropolitan area,

24:18.740 --> 24:30.953
rather than having one of the newer facilities, 
well, two of them. Well, it would have if St.

24:30.993 --> 24:36.640
Joseph's hadn't fought Humana. Humana's first 
proposal was to expand their current facility.

24:42.406 --> 24:44.468
And when that was turned down, they said, we're 
leaving Bryan. We're going to go to College

24:44.508 --> 24:46.771
Station. We're going to build a whole new 
facility. And up to that point, they intend to stay

24:48.980 --> 24:58.912
and enrich the health center that was developed. 
There are various ways to look at it. Really, the

25:01.936 --> 25:03.258
issue is access. And in terms of access, we don't 
have very much of a problem here anyway. And you can

25:09.205 --> 25:15.874
see that St. Joe's from this building will be there 
in less than 10 minutes. In most urban areas, you

25:15.894 --> 25:18.497
have a hard time doing that. Well, you can be almost 
anywhere within the area here in 10 minutes.

25:22.393 --> 25:23.735
That's true. But if you look at the future, which is 
really what we're planning for, it could very well

25:24.937 --> 25:36.456
be that their move south might end up being very 
smart. In the area of psychiatric care, I think

25:36.476 --> 25:42.365
we're going to see this area become a regional 
center or a state center. The reason for that is

25:42.385 --> 25:46.071
that there is a great deal of interest people have 
traditionally in being hospitalized outside of

25:46.675 --> 25:52.441
their home communities for psychiatric illness. 
There's a lot of stigma still associated with it.

25:57.386 --> 25:59.168
If possible, they'll go outside the town. Well, 
we're right in the middle of this huge urban

26:00.009 --> 26:06.235
triangle that will be one of the largest in the US. 
It's massive. It's going to be bigger. So you can be

26:11.120 --> 26:14.303
hospitalized in College Station, and your folks 
or your spouse or your family can visit you from San

26:14.857 --> 26:25.712
Antonio or Dallas or Austin or Waco or Houston 
without too much trouble you're within reach.

26:26.894 --> 26:30.699
Some people have referred to our area as being 
centrally isolated. Yeah, that may be it. But it's

26:33.884 --> 26:38.130
been an interesting endeavor or exercise to see 
this mix through the marketplaces really was

26:39.241 --> 26:46.269
having an impact. And in health care delivery, 
planning is not so important regionally right now

26:46.289 --> 26:57.002
as it is institutionally.

26:57.022 --> 27:03.409
The most important thing that, in Texas at least, 
that the regional health planning bodies do is

26:57.022 --> 27:03.409
provide a forum. where health providers and 
others can come together and talk about things.

27:07.163 --> 27:12.128
The networking, particularly, the bridging, 
potentially, is very important. But the issue of

27:12.149 --> 27:22.940
control, that is developing, in fact, a regional 
plan and implementing it, is not one that we're

27:12.149 --> 27:22.940
likely to see come up again for a while. It runs 
counter with the Texas values, that sort of

27:24.982 --> 27:30.848
centralization The detections are just 
suspecting that. Maybe a good reason, I'm not

27:35.079 --> 27:36.400
sure. But that's just not the way we do things here, 
I guess, if they tell you. There's another

27:43.309 --> 27:46.012
facility that we probably should mention. That's 
the university's program for fitness with their

27:46.112 --> 27:55.183
sport medicine program. And that ties in with the 
rehab center's work, I'm sure, and with all the

27:55.203 --> 28:01.611
cardiology specialists in the area? Yeah, this 
area is just really expanding. In the last five

28:08.074 --> 28:12.658
years, the number of physicians has more than 
doubled. We have virtually almost every

28:12.678 --> 28:18.403
specialty that you can imagine. Better to have the 
physicians double than the lawyers double. Well,

28:22.967 --> 28:24.129
they'll be behind me. They'll be following me. The 
more ambulances chasing me. Oh, boy. Don, we have

28:31.865 --> 28:38.311
now a new faculty member in health planning. Would 
you go into that? Sherry Bain is a nurse. Part of her

28:43.496 --> 28:45.458
background is nursing. She's a sociologist with a 
PhD in sociology from Michigan. She joined our

28:49.561 --> 28:53.725
planning faculty in 86, 87. She has very good 
research skills. and has spent a lot of time

28:59.405 --> 29:07.196
working with the various health organizations in 
the administration.

29:07.216 --> 29:10.261
She and I look forward to having more time to work 
together. In the current position, we don't have

29:10.281 --> 29:18.713
much time to do that, to develop the health systems 
program. She's currently half time in the

29:18.733 --> 29:22.238
department? She's currently 25% with medicine, 
where she continues to serve as, I think,

29:22.258 --> 29:28.467
director. or a coordinator of some such in the 
Center for Health Systems and Technology. I think

29:35.503 --> 29:43.675
that that 75% split will stay through academic 
year 87, 88. 75% with us? With us. After that, she

29:47.721 --> 29:54.832
will probably be 100% with the plan.

29:54.852 --> 29:57.576
That's the current plan at this point. Okay, we've 
recently gone through a APA accreditation visit

29:58.838 --> 30:16.835
and they have written their comments and so forth 
and the department and the college have responded

29:58.838 --> 30:16.835
to their comments. Do you have any views on that or 
anything you care to add? We dealt with all the

30:24.562 --> 30:27.124
issues that they brought up. And all of them had 
even been able to hire a new planner and person for

30:27.408 --> 30:33.677
the faculty. And with the appointment of a 
permanent dean, that was the remaining problem,

30:34.999 --> 30:45.774
that they didn't have a permanent department 
here. And with the appointment of Dr. McCarthy as

30:45.894 --> 30:52.824
permanent dean, then I'll be returning to the 
department in January of 88. And that was the only

30:52.844 --> 30:57.010
thing that was holding us up for full 
accreditation, which I feel sure that we'll get

30:57.985 --> 31:07.320
the next meeting at the front of the accreditation 
board, which I think is in October. I believe it is.

31:11.447 --> 31:24.668
I've recently interviewed at UT Arlington, and 
several of the faculty members expressed doubt

31:11.447 --> 31:24.668
that they would be re-accredited by EPA for 
various reasons. And apparently it's becoming

31:25.880 --> 31:31.567
very difficult to get that accreditation now. So 
if we get it, why not? Well, we have no reason to

31:34.450 --> 31:38.555
believe that we won't. The PAB has been very 
complimentary for the way the university has

31:38.575 --> 31:44.422
responded. They said we needed more space, so the 
university built us space. That's how we got that

31:49.728 --> 31:50.489
room up here. They said we needed more faculty. We 
got another faculty member. And we'll be getting a

31:54.112 --> 32:06.153
permanent department head back, which will 
re-focus on the MUP degree, I would think, which

31:54.112 --> 32:06.153
was one of their complaints. Yes. Yeah, I think 
that's important, too. Right now, I think for the

32:09.458 --> 32:19.275
fall, we're looking at 28 MUP and 28 MSLD and 40 
doctoral students, in my opinion. In my opinion,

32:20.791 --> 32:25.095
20 doctoral students would be adequate, 
particularly if they were active. Many of those 40

32:26.056 --> 32:29.099
or ABDs will never finish. You probably shouldn't 
be carrying them still. But 40 doctoral students

32:32.543 --> 32:38.329
for high-sized factories is much too hard. I don't 
know how we can do it responsibly. And I really

32:41.152 --> 32:45.516
think the NDP should, to me, the NDP should be up. It 
has a decent critical mass when it's up around 60 or

32:45.715 --> 32:50.402
80. I think 60 should be a

32:50.422 --> 32:55.369
minimum. In SLD, I think it would be fairly 
self-regulated. It probably won't get too much

32:58.193 --> 33:00.617
larger than it is. But I think that there's some 
really interesting vitality that we can get from

33:01.438 --> 33:06.245
that mixture. I think so. The two groups are quite 
different in terms of the types of personalities

33:08.248 --> 33:14.276
they attract. Oh, sure. But I think that's useful. 
So many times I see planners with a predictably

33:17.092 --> 33:26.104
adversarial perspective towards developers 
that may be well-deserved. I mean, we all have seen

33:26.184 --> 33:28.387
unscrupulous developers. They've screwed up a 
lot. Yeah. We've seen unscrupulous developers.

33:33.133 --> 33:44.207
But actually, the cities really need 
entrepreneurs who provide capital and take

33:33.133 --> 33:44.207
risks. And the entrepreneurs have a need for a city 
that's well-planned to protect their

33:44.744 --> 33:53.617
investments and to let them know how things are 
going to be in the future, et cetera. So I really

33:53.638 --> 34:00.889
think that there's a potential for a symbiotic 
relationship instead of an adversarial one. And I

34:01.329 --> 34:07.619
hope that these two groups of students in close 
proximity will precipitate some meaningful

34:01.329 --> 34:07.619
discussions. And hopefully the MDPs who tend to be 
public sector-oriented We'll learn to

34:13.617 --> 34:18.463
appreciate the needs of the entrepreneur. And the 
MSLDs, who are entrepreneurial, will learn to

34:18.484 --> 34:23.310
appreciate something about the planners. I heard 
one developer say that a planner's job was to see

34:23.350 --> 34:27.135
that you can't do yours. So it goes both ways, you 
see. And that's unfortunate. That doesn't have to

34:33.323 --> 34:34.545
be that way either. I think there are good examples 
where developers have approached cities very

34:35.150 --> 34:40.618
responsibly. And there were planning staffs who 
worked with developers to achieve a project of

34:41.159 --> 34:48.771
value that would never have been possible 
otherwise. And I think it's important that our

34:48.791 --> 34:56.923
students be socialized in professional school to 
have what I think would be a healthier attitude. We

34:59.407 --> 35:02.912
ought not to be unnecessarily adversarial. I 
think if you've got a guy that's out to rape the

35:03.584 --> 35:08.328
public, then it is our responsibility. I think 
it's OK to be watchful, but not adversarial. If it

35:12.972 --> 35:28.925
weren't for people willing to pick up the 
responsibility for entrepreneurial

35:12.972 --> 35:28.925
enterprise, then we'd end up with state-run

35:12.972 --> 35:28.925
capitalism. And that would lead to a pretty dead 
type of hand on development. I think the

35:35.377 --> 35:38.881
department offers a very interesting mix of 
attitudes. They take a course with you, and they

35:39.802 --> 35:45.268
get the planning gospel according to Cornish. And 
they take one with Chewy, and they get it according

35:45.288 --> 35:48.071
to Hinojosa. And then Rosa's got his own version, 
and Pew's got his version. And they take it from me,

35:52.056 --> 35:54.919
and it's another perspective. And I think that's 
important because there is no one perspective. I

35:58.663 --> 36:00.625
remember Nietzsche said... This is my way. What's 
your way? The way doesn't exist. And that's

36:06.835 --> 36:07.575
important. They have to develop their own 
professional ethics and their own professional

36:07.616 --> 36:14.144
perspectives on things. Well, it troubles the 
students because they don't know this. And we have

36:18.229 --> 36:30.325
to tell them if they really come to a point where 
it's becoming a mental problem for them that they

36:18.229 --> 36:30.325
can't seem to adjust to all of the various 
philosophies while they're in school. And I

36:30.946 --> 36:35.811
always tell them not to expect to do it until 
they're out of school for two or three years. Then

36:35.831 --> 36:37.192
we'll all start coming together. When it does, 
they'll know it. They really do.

36:51.005 --> 36:58.692
I think the doctoral program is very important 
because we need to have a good theoretical

36:51.005 --> 36:58.692
framework for the field. You know, we're such an 
eclectic profession that really our theoretical

36:59.819 --> 37:08.167
base comes from other disciplines.

37:08.187 --> 37:10.009
We are essentially applied sociology. I think 
it's important that we spend some time working on

37:12.171 --> 37:15.494
theory. A lot of our great, many of our doctoral 
research endeavors in the past have been

37:16.395 --> 37:25.344
extremely applied. I think there's room for 
theory. Theory is ultimately very practical

37:30.076 --> 37:34.002
because it explains things. It gives a framework, 
a construct for which to view things. I'm

37:38.689 --> 37:41.754
delighted to hear you say that for several 
reasons. One, I teach the course. And two, I think

37:44.158 --> 37:52.611
that theory is very practical because it gives the 
student a shorthand way of analyzing problems.

37:52.631 --> 37:56.337
And he can or she can deal with them very 
effectively and very quickly. understanding

37:56.772 --> 38:01.877
what the theoretical framework is that they're 
dealing with. We have a lot to learn, I think, or

38:01.897 --> 38:19.914
we've perhaps already learned it, but we need to 
incorporate it knowing that we're getting it from

38:01.897 --> 38:19.914
sociology and psychology, particularly small 
group psychology, political science,

38:01.897 --> 38:19.914
economics, even some in management. Management 
is another eclectic endeavor as well. I think

38:22.857 --> 38:24.619
particularly the behavioral sciences 
Architecture, I don't think, has much of a

38:25.375 --> 38:28.438
theoretical framework either. We do, of course, 
deal with design issues. I think whatever

38:32.843 --> 38:36.807
architecture has to offer us, we ought to become 
cognizant of. That's one of the things I think that

38:36.827 --> 38:38.449
bothers me. It seems that we're moving away from 
the design base that our disciplines have in the

38:38.469 --> 38:49.921
past. Maybe that's not bad, I suppose, but it I 
would like to see our students exposed, at least, a

38:53.742 --> 39:00.490
little more systematically. That is to say that we 
don't allow a student to miss exposure to design.

39:05.136 --> 39:10.763
They pick it up, but without a better design base 
than some of them have. I don't think they pick up

39:11.324 --> 39:12.585
very much of it. We used to be very visual and very 
design-oriented. Now we're much more analytical

39:16.450 --> 39:20.695
and textually-oriented. That may be simply 
commentary of the sign of the times, but it seems to

39:20.945 --> 39:39.071
me that there's something to be said for a person 
not really understanding

39:20.945 --> 39:39.071
the urban design issues when we're talking about 
urban planning. Planning, I'm always bothered by

39:39.091 --> 39:42.056
that a little bit. Planning is simply a function of 
management. We are those people who have decided

39:44.780 --> 39:49.787
to specialize in one aspect of planning. urban or 
regional setting. One aspect of management.

39:55.235 --> 39:57.958
Well, no, really one aspect of planning. One 
manifestation of planning.

40:02.504 --> 40:04.546
Because we tend to deal primarily with the 
physical. Planning of physical. Physical

40:06.589 --> 40:08.791
planning. I think I'm probably less so. I'm 
involved more with health systems than with

40:11.535 --> 40:15.139
health facilities. There are always facilities, 
manifestations of that. But I'm... I think that

40:21.897 --> 40:30.588
this department probably has a reputation of 
being strong in physical planning. And that

40:30.789 --> 40:36.316
probably is the result of the backgrounds of the 
faculty. But that has been changing over the

40:36.336 --> 40:38.318
years. And it will continue to change as some of us 
retire who have had strong physical design

40:39.340 --> 40:47.470
backgrounds. Well, I think it's important that we 
replace people who are leaving with with faculty

40:51.918 --> 40:58.966
who have similar orientations in that respect. 
The department will probably be having to look for

40:58.986 --> 41:10.878
people with PhDs more and more, since we're going 
much more into research orientation at the

40:58.986 --> 41:10.878
University in general, and our college in 
particular, than we ever have before. The chances

41:12.020 --> 41:17.646
of getting somebody with a design background are 
remote, then. It's not easy. They're around.

41:20.622 --> 41:29.313
People who have a design background, a planning 
background, both academic and professional, who

41:20.622 --> 41:29.313
also have PhDs.

41:35.100 --> 41:44.672
What has surprised me about the program here is 
that it hasn't been more physically

41:35.100 --> 41:44.672
design-oriented than it has, considering the 
faculty. And I think the faculty has, in fact, made

41:44.692 --> 41:48.216
an effort to accommodate the changing forces on 
planning profession as they've come into view

41:48.736 --> 42:15.857
with the, for example, the urban riots and the need 
for understanding the social aspects of planning

41:48.736 --> 42:15.857
and how they generate the needs for physical 
accommodation and also political And of course,

42:16.428 --> 42:20.374
Jim Gartner was particularly strong there. He was 
an elected official on several occasions. And

42:24.940 --> 42:36.718
then the new era of economic concerns that we've 
all got to get up to speed on. Yeah, I think that's

42:36.738 --> 42:37.699
true. I think the new religion of economic 
development

42:45.166 --> 42:49.092
It's very important that our students are exposed 
to the economic issues. I mean, a city is an

42:49.172 --> 42:51.276
economic entity. That's why it exists. It deals 
with the basic economic issues of life, shelter,

42:53.319 --> 43:00.030
food, security. Need for specialization. What 
struck me as being interesting was a comment made

43:04.690 --> 43:14.060
by Terry Kahn in Austin this Tuesday. And they have 
a land development emphasis

43:14.080 --> 43:27.314
within their MEP program, which is quite well 
defined. And that faculty feels that it's more

43:27.334 --> 43:31.558
appropriate for their MSNCP degree to have it a 
well-defined area of concern within the master's

43:32.247 --> 43:49.972
in planning degree rather than going for an MS in 
land development. Here we have not chosen to do

43:51.835 --> 43:54.639
that. We have our MS in land development and NEP, as 
I say, are separate degrees. I would hope that

44:02.943 --> 44:05.186
there's some cross-fertilization. I think there 
is.

44:10.893 --> 44:23.310
I think it tends, the land development emphasis 
tends to have more of an impact on the planning

44:10.893 --> 44:23.310
students than the planning students do on the land 
development students, which I think is

44:10.893 --> 44:23.310
unfortunate.

44:23.330 --> 44:24.411
So far, I think that's true.

44:28.238 --> 44:39.431
How do you, what anticipations do you have for next 
year, moving back to the

44:28.238 --> 44:39.431
department? Well, I think it'll be interesting to 
see how our new dean works out and what he does. He

44:44.817 --> 44:53.487
has told me that he has great promises of 
additional revenue or resources from the

44:44.817 --> 44:53.487
university. And I hope that that's true. And I hope 
that we get our fair share of that.

45:02.663 --> 45:03.644
I don't know, Bob. I've been away from the 
apartment for so long, I don't even know what to

45:03.745 --> 45:09.513
expect. I know that in some ways it's running right 
now like a fine-tooth watch. Very certainly,

45:13.079 --> 45:18.807
in many ways. Aspects of that are certainly worth 
keeping.

45:30.906 --> 45:31.827
We have... You mentioned physical planning and 
urban design.

45:40.289 --> 45:43.373
That brings up the topic of the lab. And I'm just 
wondering, you and I have discussed an

45:43.714 --> 46:02.758
undergraduate degree and restructuring of the 
numbering system for the courses in the

45:43.714 --> 46:02.758
department, all of which have had to be put on hold 
for whatever reasons. And I'm just wondering if

46:03.025 --> 46:18.240
you've had a chance to give that much thought in 
terms of instituting an undergraduate degree

46:03.025 --> 46:18.240
program in urbanism.

46:18.260 --> 46:19.441
I haven't thought about it much since we talked 
about that. I mean, we did a major study on that

46:19.461 --> 46:22.945
about a year ago. We found a lot of interest across 
the campus. It may be timely in that we've gone

46:27.229 --> 46:31.193
forward with the core curriculum. across the 
university. It may well be that it would be seen as a

46:33.017 --> 46:38.446
natural extension of that.

46:41.431 --> 46:47.241
On the other hand, it might be viewed as being the 
wrong time in terms of economic conditions.
