WEBVTT

00:02.760 --> 00:08.760
So he kind of had two conflicting things going at 
once. One, he was trying to enlarge the service

00:08.740 --> 00:16.940
component of the department, and to this end he 
hired technical writing people. However, he was

00:20.460 --> 00:30.160
also, in a less pronounced way, trying to expand 
the literary offerings, and we did acquire a bunch

00:30.140 --> 00:35.580
of good people when he was head. From what 
institutions? Oh, gee, I don't know. Were these

00:41.100 --> 00:43.120
new PhDs? These were new PhDs, and they were from 
all over. Naturally, we have always had a bunch of

00:46.720 --> 00:54.860
people from UT, but they came from all over the 
country. And as far as you were aware, did we begin

00:54.840 --> 01:00.660
to be competitive in our beginning salaries for 
these new?

01:07.420 --> 01:13.120
I can't say because I only have a sense of what we 
were offering as opposed to what other places were

01:13.100 --> 01:16.760
offering, but I would say yes, we could not have 
brought some of these people here if we hadn't been

01:16.740 --> 01:21.440
offering what other places were offering. And the 
graduate program, how was it changing? It was

01:24.620 --> 01:31.370
getting better students.

01:31.350 --> 01:34.770
It was getting more and better students. This is 
what I want to see more of even now. The master's

01:36.850 --> 01:43.830
program was developing as a separate entity, 
which it should be, and I think that recently we've

01:43.810 --> 01:48.250
kind of sacrificed the master's program to the PhD 
program. We don't have that many students coming

01:48.230 --> 01:53.210
through anymore getting masters and finding 
jobs, and I want to see this. If we have to offer a

01:54.190 --> 01:58.230
degree in professional writing or something, I'd 
like to see us get back our master's program. Were

02:01.650 --> 02:04.510
there any opportunities missed back there in the 
80s and 90s? Some things that could have been done

02:04.490 --> 02:09.600
that weren't? For one thing, we did not have much in 
the way of multiculturalism at all. I'm sure that

02:17.060 --> 02:24.640
opportunities were missed there.

02:24.620 --> 02:32.120
Lately there's been a lot of cross-disciplinary 
action, but we could have done that earlier, and

02:32.100 --> 02:36.220
some of us tried to, and it was not, it was frowned 
on. It was very hard to, for instance, get

02:36.200 --> 02:39.080
something going. Teaching? Teaching. Teaching 
something or get a pair of courses going. Can you

02:43.760 --> 02:47.640
give an example of one that you or someone 
attempted to? Oh,

02:47.620 --> 02:58.860
I remember starting, attempting to start an 
adolescent psychology and the adolescent novel

02:58.840 --> 03:05.520
course, and the hurdles seemed just too great to 
pursue that project. I don't remember how far we

03:05.500 --> 03:11.240
got with it, but it looked as though this just 
couldn't be done. And so maybe it could have if we

03:11.609 --> 03:13.040
pushed it, but we didn't. Okay. What became your 
normal routine of teaching? What courses? Well, I

03:18.625 --> 03:22.560
slipped into creative writing, because that's 
what I've always been most interested in. And, oh,

03:23.082 --> 03:33.020
I guess I first had the chance to teach that about 12 
years ago, and there has been more and more demand

03:33.000 --> 03:34.421
for it. The core curriculum allows some people, 
like in education, to take it as a

03:34.400 --> 03:43.420
quasi-requirement, that is. They have the choice 
of creative writing or some other things. And we

03:47.580 --> 03:53.940
just, we divided it into poetry and prose instead 
of just teaching it all together. And it really

03:53.920 --> 03:56.420
took off. Now, for instance, this semester I have 
exclusively creative writing classes. How many?

04:01.645 --> 04:02.420
Two. But two creative writing classes makes for a 
lot of work, because each ego is involved. Like

04:13.370 --> 04:14.871
it's teaching more to teach. Two creative writing 
classes than it is to teach more students in a lit

04:14.850 --> 04:18.690
class, because lit students, you're not grating 
their souls. So

04:23.510 --> 04:31.560
my normal routine now is teaching creative 
writing and women's novels. And these are both

04:31.540 --> 04:34.880
upper-level undergraduate? No, they can be 
either lower level. For instance, one of my

04:38.300 --> 04:42.940
creative writing classes is 226, which is 
essentially a sophomore-level class. It'll have

04:43.407 --> 04:45.880
freshmen in it, too, because they pass that. They 
place out of the freshman class. About how many per

04:47.480 --> 04:49.500
section? Twenty-five. And then the, let's see, 
you mentioned another, other than creative

04:52.074 --> 04:57.000
writing, you mentioned another? Women's novels. 
Women's novels. I have either 45 or 35 in there,

05:00.088 --> 05:04.480
depending on which level it is. And that's upper 
level? That's upper level. It's either 374 or 474.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.980
In that course, what are your favorite novels that 
you urge them to read? Okay. We read Sylvia

05:14.776 --> 05:15.980
Plath's. The Bell Jar. We read Maxine Hong 
Kingston's Woman Warrior. We read Toni

05:20.600 --> 05:22.500
Morrison's Beloved. Let's see. What else? We read 
Kay Chopin's The Awakening.

05:33.620 --> 05:38.080
Very often we start with Jane Eyre because I always 
teach it the same way I teach it as The Buildings

05:38.060 --> 05:43.040
Roman, which is the novel of development or 
education. I read a lot of books. I read a lot of

05:44.940 --> 05:45.961
books. I read a lot of books. I read a lot of books. 
And some of them have a

05:47.940 --> 06:11.560
very wide Federation

05:47.940 --> 06:11.560
of Deadly ignored lines. Shucks! I FM it on for five 
minutes. And she reads half of it.

06:20.680 --> 06:29.400
half female but I don't know and are they are there 
some minority also yes we have quite a few now we

06:29.380 --> 06:36.620
have let's see we've got peaches Henry coming in 
she's she's on some sort of odd fellowship for this

06:36.600 --> 06:40.580
year but it was her first name peaches I thought you 
said peaches peaches Henry and we hired her away

06:40.560 --> 06:44.440
from Notre Dame we've got okay

06:44.420 --> 06:56.160
Kamla duty is new she's a visiting assistant 
professor we have Kimberly Brown let's see now

06:56.140 --> 07:01.420
that's two of Kimberly Brown all these are 
african-americans

07:01.400 --> 07:12.680
can't remember his name we have four five if you 
count peaches I believe african-american

07:12.660 --> 07:19.540
faculty and then we have Marco Patel is I that we are 
no longer coming into the College Station we have

07:20.940 --> 07:24.100
this huge number of American graduate students 
who were coming to the College Station I think that

07:28.800 --> 07:33.740
it surprises me a little that we are not able to get 
and keep

07:33.720 --> 07:40.210
many Hispanic faculty we have had better luck with 
African Americans and I don't really understand

07:40.190 --> 07:43.710
that because here we are but I guess they don't want 
to come to College Station compare the students

07:43.690 --> 07:50.270
now and the students then okay now there are are 
women students because I teach poetry writing.

07:54.540 --> 07:55.610
The fiction people get a few more men. The

07:55.951 --> 08:04.913
students are less likely to do what I say. They 
don't call me ma'am. They're more likely to. What

08:08.560 --> 08:09.620
do they call you? How do they address you? They call 
me Professor McCann or Dr. McCann. Okay. I

08:15.611 --> 08:20.130
actually, I'd like to encourage my graduate 
students to call me by my first name, but they don't

08:20.110 --> 08:20.631
do it. They, they're

08:20.651 --> 08:37.260
more intellectually involved, many of them,

08:20.651 --> 08:37.260
but I'm not teaching the same things. And if I were 
teaching freshmen now, I might find them a lot,

08:40.533 --> 08:44.870
that is, they would be multicultural and there 
would be a lot of women, but they too might think of

08:50.290 --> 08:54.570
the class as something to be got through as opposed 
to something that they're passionately

08:54.550 --> 08:55.199
interested in. People don't take creative 
writing unless they're interested in it. So I

08:57.350 --> 09:01.948
don't have sleeping students the way I used to. But 
they would be very polite when awakened back then.

09:07.080 --> 09:15.120
What are, what are their career goals today?

09:15.100 --> 09:16.949
An awful lot of them want to teach. Some of them want 
to teach in high schools. My undergraduates, some

09:21.590 --> 09:23.795
of them want to teach in high schools, and I think 
that's great. We certainly need people teaching

09:25.130 --> 09:26.440
in high schools. Some of them want to teach in 
college. Of course, my graduate students. People

09:31.673 --> 09:34.641
who are getting a PhD in English all want to teach in 
college. I don't have, when

09:41.820 --> 09:47.520
I get the women's novels class, that is not for 
English majors necessarily, and I get a lot of

09:47.500 --> 09:53.520
people there who are, a lot of women who are going 
into business and industry. I don't, they're

09:53.500 --> 09:56.720
going to be personnel managers. I get a lot of 
psychology majors. I get mostly women in those

09:59.940 --> 10:04.760
classes too, I would say five to one, because it's 
rare that a man wants I get mostly women in the

10:05.800 --> 10:06.821
department. And I know the women's coming of age 
novels, but I get a few. The, as far as you're aware,

10:10.690 --> 10:23.000
in terms of offices, salary, promotions and so 
forth, have women been treated equitably in

10:22.980 --> 10:27.220
recent years in the department? Not

10:27.200 --> 10:32.617
really. As far as offices and so forth, yes. And I 
think Larry Mitchell makes a real effort at this.

10:43.100 --> 10:52.050
especially

10:43.100 --> 10:52.050
in the recent past there's been quite a bit of 
discrimination against women I think and it takes

10:52.030 --> 11:04.460
funny forms

10:52.030 --> 11:04.460
and

10:52.030 --> 11:04.460
there are a few women in high profile positions but 
I'm not sure they have real power

11:04.440 --> 11:16.680
but I know that the efforts are being made but 
they're funny things happen for instance here's

11:16.660 --> 11:21.040
an example there was some group that was supposed 
to study the situation and the women's salaries

11:21.020 --> 11:25.100
are not as high as the men's I mean there's no 
question of that if you look at the salaries for

11:25.080 --> 11:32.580
women women full professors for instance now of 
course there are various ways of looking at the

11:32.560 --> 11:37.400
information if you look at them on a on a 
university-wide wide level you get something

11:37.380 --> 11:42.020
like a twenty thousand dollar difference at least 
and then other people argue well the women are in

11:42.000 --> 11:47.320
liberal arts but of course part of this is because 
the women were not really welcomed in those other

11:47.300 --> 11:51.420
fields and it's still harder for a woman to get to 
get tenure in some of these other fields I mean I

11:51.400 --> 11:55.360
look at what they did to Lynn Lamoureux that was a 
case where she was promised all kinds of things

11:55.340 --> 12:02.460
when she came out here and she got none of them and 
then they didn't give her tenure but of course she

12:07.930 --> 12:13.980
got tenure but she had to go through the legal 
system and she was originally she's now in another

12:13.960 --> 12:19.140
department because when they tenured her when 
they they were told by the law that they had to

12:19.120 --> 12:25.740
tenure her or or lose something major they did but 
they stuck her in another department but I'm sure

12:26.440 --> 12:34.380
there's if you want to look her up her name is 
Lamoureux in English what about far as you know

12:34.360 --> 12:43.070
about comparable salaries and promotions

12:34.360 --> 12:43.070
I think they're about even in English I don't see a 
real discrepancy and as far as you know when there

12:43.050 --> 12:49.370
are recruitment opportunities that there is an 
effort to be balanced and fair oh I don't think that

12:49.350 --> 12:56.420
I don't think we even make that an issue anymore 
that is I really think that people are looked at I

12:57.060 --> 13:07.420
don't think sex plays a role anymore I think that we 
do have a balance we may have more women than men we

13:07.400 --> 13:14.290
brought in some women we brought in Jen Swearengen 
for instance at a full professor level uh I don't

13:22.140 --> 13:31.780
think that there's a problem with that who who a 
knowledgeable outsider would know recognize

13:22.140 --> 13:31.780
most which faculty in English would an outside 
informed outsider know most about through the

13:31.820 --> 13:38.800
high highest visibility uh Margaret Ezell Ezell 
yes she is in British literature and everybody

13:38.780 --> 13:49.840
knows her uh outside of Margaret let's see there 
are a whole bunch of people that are pretty well

13:50.720 --> 13:55.960
known like Larry Reynolds and uh of course Jerry 
Loving would go next to Margaret Ezell Jerry

14:02.590 --> 14:11.850
Loving he's American lit and he's got a very well 
reviewed uh book about Walt Whitman out and I would

14:11.830 --> 14:16.650
say probably next to Margaret the next person to be 
known would be Jerry um

14:16.630 --> 14:27.850
he's written several books on Whitman this one 
though is popular as well as scholarly and he's

14:30.050 --> 14:36.000
been on all the he was interviewed all over the 
country by all of these major shows let's see who

14:36.520 --> 14:44.160
else Larry after Margaret and Jerry then there'd 
be Larry Bedford-Clark is pretty well known as a as

14:44.140 --> 14:57.040
a Warren scholar um Robert Penn Warren let's see 
who else

14:44.140 --> 14:57.040
well Jan Swearengen is known for her work on in 
rhetoric uh I would say those are the people do you

14:57.020 --> 15:04.490
have the impression that the department is making 
progress these days is it getting stronger

15:04.470 --> 15:08.870
getting better yeah I think it is actually I think 
it is we've lost a bunch of faculty members but

15:11.730 --> 15:19.190
we've also brought in some very new ones and 
certainly in certain areas we're making strides

15:19.170 --> 15:24.290
we are now extremely multicultural whereas six 
years ago we were hardly multicultural at all who

15:24.270 --> 15:31.640
deserves credit for that Larry Mitchell I'd have 
to say

15:31.620 --> 15:41.700
he is definitely a head not a chair but he has and 
I've had a lot of differences with him but he has I

15:41.680 --> 15:43.860
think uh done a lot to make the department 
multicultural fairer to women and so forth about

15:44.320 --> 15:53.520
how many uh full-time tenure track faculty are 
there now 50

15:53.500 --> 16:08.950
60. or between 60 and 70. yeah but that that's easy 
enough uh information to get in the main office I

16:08.930 --> 16:14.950
don't know it uh and does the department ever get 
together yes and no uh not

16:21.210 --> 16:22.191
it gets together uh there's an annual party to 
welcome the graduate students and I would say a

16:28.410 --> 16:34.370
third of the faculty attend a Larry Mitchell will 
have a party for the entire faculty two thirds will

16:34.350 --> 16:40.700
attend that but it doesn't get together because 
these things are huge crowded parties and you go

16:40.680 --> 16:48.740
and you grab your uh whatever and say hello to 
everybody and slither out the other door because

16:48.720 --> 16:53.300
it's just too crowded for real conversation that 
is something that it's just hard to do to have real

16:53.580 --> 16:59.660
conversations at parties and really get together 
with your fellow faculty members so how do you and

16:59.640 --> 17:05.900
your faculty friends from whatever department 
how do you get together I would say that my

17:05.880 --> 17:15.550
faculty friends and I will have dinner together 
sometimes I at one another's homes I used to give

17:16.780 --> 17:23.490
parties but it's I don't do it anymore it seems too 
much and there's more work that is one problem

17:23.470 --> 17:26.970
there is more work there are more meetings people 
get so they just want to get a shot of all of this they

17:33.490 --> 17:38.590
don't want to take it home but when we do get 
together we get together for dinner all right so

17:38.570 --> 17:42.890
you're saying that compared to 20 30 years ago 
you're working harder are the students working

17:42.870 --> 17:50.150
harder no they're working about the same amount 
how would you compare the capability of students

17:50.130 --> 17:59.120
performance today who gets an A or a D with one who 
got an A or B 30 30 years ago I would say that the

18:05.400 --> 18:11.780
gentleman C is not a gentlemen D B yeah what I would 
like to see is the introduction of plus and minus

18:11.760 --> 18:17.070
grades I said that you could still distinguish 
among A's and B's because most of us on upper low in

18:20.110 --> 18:25.090
upper level level courses not only not only 
throughout the college of liberal arts but in

18:25.070 --> 18:29.170
other colleges too most the grades are most are a's 
and b's and they didn't used to be but you're saying

18:30.190 --> 18:38.050
that that a or b doesn't require as much work as it 
used to uh i don't think it requires as high a level

18:38.030 --> 18:47.650
of confidence no i don't i think that students that 
i gave c's to 30 years ago with many of them would now

18:47.630 --> 18:53.890
get b's uh and as the students are entering today 
are they better prepared from the high school than

18:53.870 --> 19:01.340
they used to be or no no they're not they're not not 
certainly not an area of writing skills they could

19:01.320 --> 19:10.170
write better than um

19:01.320 --> 19:10.170
what major issues do you think a m should be 
concerned about today okay multiculturalism and

19:10.150 --> 19:26.700
fairness uh i

19:10.150 --> 19:26.700
don't know i i know that we're working on it because 
we have a bunch of new faculty who are members of

19:26.760 --> 19:34.160
minority groups so we're working on it but i don't 
know more

19:35.660 --> 19:42.990
needs to be done with the students with this 
because a lot of students don't have the message

19:42.970 --> 19:49.570
and yet it can't be done in the form of i don't think i 
don't i don't know how this new program is going to

19:49.550 --> 19:55.250
work where people have to take

19:55.230 --> 20:02.590
classes i don't know if this is going to fix things 
up or not but i do not know something needs to be done

20:02.970 --> 20:07.150
because i see some basic racism around uh

20:08.530 --> 20:19.870
in a way too i think we need to sometimes i think that 
some of the interest in cross-disciplinary work

20:20.990 --> 20:27.010
multiculturalism multiculturalism and so forth 
is more cosmetic than real and i don't know how to

20:26.990 --> 20:35.250
make it more real but i think it needs to be made more 
real

20:38.660 --> 20:41.560
right other for instance can if you'll turn it off 
i'll give you a second right now we're talking

20:41.540 --> 20:48.740
about things that can be done today and yeah some 
goals that should a m should undertake uh

20:48.720 --> 21:04.870
i'm trying to think of other things besides 
multicultural multiculturalism there are a lot

21:04.850 --> 21:11.660
of initiatives that are being taken that for 
instance there's a lot of movement toward

21:11.640 --> 21:19.180
cross-disciplinary work and collaboration uh i 
think we need to become more international and

21:22.500 --> 21:29.840
we're doing that uh now what do you mean by 
international i think i know but i want to be sure i

21:29.820 --> 21:36.830
mean setting up programs collaborating with 
programs overseas getting overseas

21:36.810 --> 21:46.200
collaborations going and of course with mexico 
too and i participated in the faculty faculty

21:46.180 --> 21:52.200
abroad seminar in mexico and i thought that was 
very good should we give more encouragement for

21:53.700 --> 22:00.200
students to learn a second language yes i think 
that we need to give more more than encouragement i

22:00.180 --> 22:06.510
think it should be required that everybody learn a 
second language if i could if i could be the emperor

22:07.130 --> 22:11.790
i would make that a baccalaureate degree 
requirement yeah and for the modern world

22:13.210 --> 22:19.860
and in fact though i think that we are doing we are 
taking steps in this direction but i think that yes

22:19.840 --> 22:23.780
we need to encourage to encourage everyone to 
become more aware of other cultures and to learn

22:25.300 --> 22:30.760
about them i remember reading that uh report where 
somebody said something to the effect that they

22:30.740 --> 22:35.880
couldn't send aggies to new york let alone to japan 
or something like that we need to make it so that

22:40.420 --> 22:46.200
aggies can go anywhere and know how to behave is 
there any school or program you can think of that we

22:46.180 --> 22:53.320
might use as a model is there any institution that 
is i think we have to make up our own direction for

22:54.580 --> 22:56.760
this because there are a lot of different 
institutions that we might use as a model but they

22:58.580 --> 23:04.520
have to do with particular institutions i don't 
think that we could adopt somebody else's program

23:04.500 --> 23:11.760
what should the department's goals be the english 
department schools okay i think we should

23:11.740 --> 23:19.830
strengthen our master's program and introduce

23:11.740 --> 23:19.830
an attractive professional writing program we 
should be willing to

23:25.810 --> 23:27.750
provide help teachers in high schools get masters 
in english because i think that we've got a

23:27.890 --> 23:34.630
situation kind of where the tail's wagging the dog 
with the texas education association they're

23:34.610 --> 23:39.910
dictating to us what we should be teaching and 
they're not having the right they don't have the

23:39.890 --> 23:46.550
right emphases i think we need to work on that

23:46.530 --> 23:55.150
i think we need to strengthen linguistics i think 
we need to strengthen creative writing it always i

23:55.130 --> 23:59.970
always thought that creative writing a wonderful 
possibility for bringing in multicultural

24:00.110 --> 24:04.210
people, but we've never done it. We did have 
Gordon, and we kind of inherited him from theater

24:04.190 --> 24:10.001
arts. He didn't come to us originally, I don't 
believe, I'm not sure, but he was very definitely

24:11.650 --> 24:17.560
an asset while we had him. And we could, for 
instance, since he died, there's been nobody to

24:20.092 --> 24:26.340
teach playwriting. We have this whole, we don't 
have a program in creative writing, but we do have a

24:31.180 --> 24:33.757
track, and it's got a missing stare. So this would 
be a wonderful opportunity to bring in a Hispanic

24:37.280 --> 24:44.100
or black playwright, but this won't happen 
because our emphasis is very much on literary

24:44.080 --> 24:49.793
scholarship of a particular sort, essentially 
theory. And I think we need to, everybody else in

24:51.100 --> 24:57.060
the department will tell you differently, but I 
think that we should focus less on theory and more

24:57.040 --> 25:02.400
on these other areas so that we are a strong 
department across the board. We don't just have

25:03.180 --> 25:06.260
strong theory contingent. Your personal goals. 
My personal goals. Well,

25:12.331 --> 25:18.620
for my scholarship, you mean, or? For your 
professional. For my professional development,

25:20.400 --> 25:22.954
okay. Well, I do anthologies. I've done two of them 
with someone else, and I'm working on a third one

25:27.660 --> 25:30.318
myself. I'd like to put together a really good 
anthology of poetry. I also have my own poetry

25:38.300 --> 25:41.174
collections. I'd like to get one of these 
published by a well-known press. So far, I've only

25:48.284 --> 25:53.237
been able to interest small press in my work. I have 
a kind of strange project that is a book of poetry

25:58.290 --> 26:01.395
based on letters. I have a collection of letters. I 
collect old letters, and this is a collection of

26:03.330 --> 26:10.720
letters written by members

26:03.330 --> 26:10.720
of a, by the two halves of a courting couple in 1830. 
And they get married, they have children, then

26:18.320 --> 26:19.774
they become family letters. Somebody kept these 
letters that start actually in 1828 and end in

26:22.360 --> 26:27.024
1863, I think is the last one. And I've done poems 
that are dramatic monologues based on these

26:29.980 --> 26:31.728
letters. And I'm also trying to fill some history 
in. Some of the groups that they refer to. Okay.

26:40.864 --> 26:42.840
Some of the journals and so forth. I'm trying to 
find out more information about these to put

26:45.300 --> 26:46.874
little historical bridges in. And I want to get 
somebody interested in printing this. It's

26:49.740 --> 26:57.650
fascinating the way you can see into this couple 
from this perspective and how they lived because

26:57.630 --> 27:05.260
these, they wrote meticulously detailed letters 
of how they lived, what they had for lunch. He was a

27:07.175 --> 27:10.580
school teacher who later became a Baptist 
minister, I believe. After the sequence of

27:10.560 --> 27:14.817
letters was finished. And

27:15.962 --> 27:20.360
most of the letters are actually from the courting 
period. And it's just interesting to see what

27:22.534 --> 27:26.420
courtship between very religious people was like 
at that time. Of course, I've got a lot of other

27:29.321 --> 27:32.000
letters from that time in my collection. And 
religion, Christianity was very definitely

27:33.408 --> 27:38.740
woven into the fabric of lives the way it is not now. 
All decisions. Okay. were referred to Providence

27:42.065 --> 27:47.700
and biblical

28:45.760 --> 29:03.620
The

28:45.760 --> 29:03.620
first one is somebody who is interested in 
multiculturalism or new directions of thought,

29:03.600 --> 29:11.350
but he should not be like I was over here earlier. He 
should be somebody who is going to be fair to all

29:11.330 --> 29:17.950
departments and not just the departments that he 
comes from. He should be somebody who is going to be

29:19.130 --> 29:20.740
a leader in the department. that he comes from. 
Somebody who is familiar with interdisciplinary

29:24.760 --> 29:33.210
work in the direction of sitting down. T or T, and 
I'd like to do a T, of course. I should do somebody

29:38.330 --> 29:51.200
who's interested

29:38.330 --> 29:51.200
in looking at how women are treated in the 
colleges. No, I don't know. My department, as I

29:52.672 --> 29:56.200
said, I don't see anything there. However, I know 
people who have been treated very fairly in other

29:56.180 --> 30:02.450
departments, I believe. So he should be able to 
kind of reset these switches in those

30:02.430 --> 30:10.370
departments. From

30:10.350 --> 30:15.020
what kind of institution should he be reset? I 
would say in a large phase.

30:20.560 --> 30:29.130
He wouldn't do well with somebody who had to deal 
with only small numbers of things. Right

30:29.110 --> 30:33.540
now, you're advising the provost. I

30:33.520 --> 30:40.530
don't even know what the provost does. He's there. 
What does he do? If you tell me what he does, maybe I

30:43.660 --> 30:46.680
can make some suggestions. What about the 
president? Again, I don't know what their

30:48.660 --> 30:51.680
functions are. What direction should the 
president lead this? I think in the direction of

30:56.250 --> 31:08.100
increasing the number of faculty all across the 
board, of reducing the number of large... This is

31:11.160 --> 31:12.181
done... For financial reasons, they have these 
huge courses. I think these should be reduced to

31:16.160 --> 31:19.180
very few courses. I think those should be only the 
most basic courses.
