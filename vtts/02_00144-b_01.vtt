WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:08.738
So kind of had two conflicting things going at once.

00:09.199 --> 00:14.126
One, he was trying to enlarge the service component of the department.

00:15.408 --> 00:19.193
And to this end, he hired technical writing people.

00:21.076 --> 00:29.228
However, he was also, in a less pronounced way, trying to expand the literary offerings.

00:29.765 --> 00:34.029
And we did acquire a bunch of good people when he was head.

00:35.351 --> 00:38.174
From what institutions?

00:39.315 --> 00:40.917
Oh, gee, I don't know.

00:41.357 --> 00:43.119
Were these new PhDs?

00:43.619 --> 00:46.062
These were new PhDs and they were from all over.

00:47.103 --> 00:53.730
Naturally, we have always had a bunch of people from UT, but they came from all over the country.

00:54.622 --> 01:03.070
And as far as you are aware, did we begin to be competitive in our beginning salaries for these new?

01:07.473 --> 01:14.099
I can't say because I only have a sense of what we were offering as opposed to what other places were offering.

01:14.119 --> 01:19.824
But I would say yes, we could not have brought some of these people here if we hadn't been offering what other places were offering.

01:21.286 --> 01:23.768
And the graduate program, how was it changing?

01:24.355 --> 01:29.100
It was getting better students.

01:31.207 --> 01:32.729
It was getting more and better students.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.374
And this is what I want to see more of even now.

01:36.774 --> 01:41.861
The master's program was developing as a separate entity, which it should be.

01:42.201 --> 01:47.848
And I think that recently we've kind of sacrificed the master's program to the PhD program.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.793
We don't have that many students coming through anymore getting master's and finding jobs.

01:52.875 --> 01:53.836
And I want to see this.

01:54.316 --> 01:59.543
If we have to offer a degree in professional writing or something, I'd like to see us get back our master's program.

02:00.603 --> 02:04.949
Were there any opportunities missed back there in the 80s and 90s?

02:06.831 --> 02:09.495
Some things that could have been done that weren't?

02:09.515 --> 02:15.623
For one thing, we did not have much in the way of multiculturalism at all.

02:17.626 --> 02:19.809
I'm sure that opportunities were missed there.

02:24.295 --> 02:29.682
Lately, there's been a lot of cross-disciplinary action

02:30.202 --> 02:36.133
But we could have done that earlier, and some of us tried to, and it was not, it was frowned on.

02:36.233 --> 02:43.246
It was very hard to, for instance, get something going, teach something or get apparel courses going.

02:43.647 --> 02:48.396
Can you give an example of one that you or someone attempted to?

02:53.354 --> 03:05.391
I remember starting, attempting to start an adolescent psychology and the adolescent novel course, and the hurdles seemed just too great to pursue that project.

03:05.571 --> 03:14.383
I don't remember how far we got with it, but it looked as though this just couldn't be done, and so maybe it could if we pushed it, but we didn't.

03:14.633 --> 03:17.238
What became your normal routine of teaching?

03:17.539 --> 03:18.501
What courses?

03:18.601 --> 03:22.690
Well I slipped into creative writing because that's what I've always been most interested in.

03:22.730 --> 03:31.107
And oh I guess I first had the chance to teach that about 12 years ago.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.309
There has been more and more demand for it.

03:34.329 --> 03:46.581
The core curriculum allows some people, like in education, to take it as a quasi requirement, that is they have the choice of creative writing or some other things.

03:47.253 --> 03:53.243
And we just, we divided it into poetry and prose instead of just teaching it all together.

03:53.283 --> 03:56.028
And it really took off.

03:56.769 --> 04:00.456
Now for instance this semester I have exclusively creative writing classes.

04:01.718 --> 04:02.459
How many?

04:02.479 --> 04:02.579
Two.

04:03.741 --> 04:07.708
But two creative writing classes.

04:09.123 --> 04:13.207
makes for a lot of work because each ego is involved.

04:13.287 --> 04:22.036
It's teaching more to teach two creative writing classes than it is to teach more students in a lit class because lit students, you're not grading their souls.

04:23.457 --> 04:29.943
So my normal routine now is teaching creative writing and women's novels.

04:31.385 --> 04:34.928
And these are both upper level undergraduate

04:35.600 --> 04:38.205
No, they can be either lower level.

04:38.245 --> 04:47.381
For instance, one of my creative writing classes is 226, which is essentially a sophomore level class that will have freshmen in it too because they pass out, they place out of the freshman class.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.886
About how many per section?

04:49.926 --> 04:50.527
25.

04:52.069 --> 04:57.439
And then the, you mentioned another, other than creative writing, you mentioned another.

04:57.940 --> 04:58.741
Women's novels.

04:58.821 --> 04:59.683
Women's novels.

04:59.883 --> 05:04.308
I have either 45 or 35 in there, depending on which level it is.

05:04.368 --> 05:05.149
And that's upper level?

05:05.169 --> 05:06.271
That's upper level.

05:06.331 --> 05:08.413
It's either 374 or 474.

05:09.575 --> 05:13.980
In that course, what are your favorite novels that you urge them to read?

05:14.460 --> 05:16.963
Okay, we read Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.506
We read Maxine Hong Kingston's Woman Warrior.

05:20.568 --> 05:22.210
We read Toni Morrison's Beloved.

05:24.753 --> 05:25.574
Let's see, what else?

05:26.975 --> 05:27.696
We read...

05:29.583 --> 05:31.024
Kay Chopin's The Awakening.

05:33.427 --> 05:37.611
Very often we start with Jane Eyre, because I always teach it the same way.

05:37.631 --> 05:41.955
I teach it as The Buildings for Mom, which is the novel of development or education.

05:42.916 --> 05:49.662
And so I use only novels which show either coming of age or a learning experience at some other point in life.

05:51.584 --> 05:56.569
So often we use as our basic example that.

05:58.574 --> 06:05.622
Jane Eyre and then proceed through more contemporary ones up till the latest ones.

06:07.444 --> 06:14.711
And for you, you are now one of about how many women on the faculty in English?

06:16.914 --> 06:17.294
A lot.

06:18.495 --> 06:22.460
I would say that the faculty is about half male, half female, but I don't know.

06:23.040 --> 06:28.446
And are there some minorities also?

06:28.612 --> 06:30.594
Yes, we have quite a few now.

06:30.634 --> 06:34.679
We have, let's see, we've got Peaches Henry coming in.

06:36.461 --> 06:39.544
She's on some sort of odd fellowship for this year.

06:39.665 --> 06:40.686
What was her first name?

06:40.706 --> 06:41.046
Peaches.

06:41.347 --> 06:42.748
I thought you said Peaches.

06:42.768 --> 06:43.569
Peaches Henry.

06:43.589 --> 06:45.171
And we hired her away from Notre Dame.

06:46.092 --> 06:52.679
We've got, okay, Kamla Dutti is new.

06:53.721 --> 06:55.783
She's a visiting assistant professor.

06:56.472 --> 07:00.257
We have Kimberly Brown, let's see, no, that's two.

07:00.277 --> 07:02.340
We have Kimberly Brown, all these are African Americans.

07:03.422 --> 07:09.310
Oh gosh, I can't remember his name.

07:10.091 --> 07:18.042
We have four, five if you count Peaches, I believe, African American faculty, and then we have Marco Patalas.

07:19.743 --> 07:26.700
It kind of surprises me a little that we are not able to get and keep many Hispanic faculty.

07:27.462 --> 07:33.837
We have had better luck with African Americans, and I don't really understand that because here we are, but I guess they don't want to come to College Station.

07:35.369 --> 07:41.136
So compare the students now and the students then.

07:41.497 --> 07:41.897
Okay.

07:41.978 --> 07:45.983
Now there are students, I get students from all cultures at least.

07:46.924 --> 07:53.773
I get about an equal balance of male and female students, maybe even a few more women students because I teach poetry writing.

07:54.514 --> 07:57.698
The fiction people get a few more men.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.864
The students are less likely to do what I say.

08:04.904 --> 08:06.165
They don't call me ma'am.

08:07.426 --> 08:10.730
They're more likely to... What do they call you?

08:10.750 --> 08:13.313
They call me Professor McCann or Dr. McCann.

08:16.016 --> 08:20.621
Actually, I'd like to encourage my graduate students to call me by my first name, but they don't do it.

08:20.641 --> 08:30.672
They're more intellectually involved

08:31.293 --> 08:31.974
Many of them.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.243
But I'm not teaching the same things.

08:40.526 --> 08:43.571
And if I were teaching freshmen now, I might find them a lot.

08:44.152 --> 08:48.037
That is, they would be multicultural and there would be a lot of women.

08:48.778 --> 08:55.208
But they too might think of the class as something to be got through as opposed to something that they're passionately interested in.

08:55.288 --> 08:57.651
People don't take creative writing unless they're interested.

08:57.992 --> 09:00.135
So I don't have sleeping students.

09:01.077 --> 09:01.898
the way I used to.

09:01.938 --> 09:06.303
But they would be very polite when awakened back then.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.146
What are their career goals today?

09:10.608 --> 09:16.936
An awful lot of them want to teach.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.139
Some of them want to teach in high schools.

09:20.580 --> 09:23.764
My undergraduates, some of them want to teach in high schools, and I think that's great.

09:24.525 --> 09:26.447
We certainly need people teaching in high schools.

09:27.648 --> 09:29.090
Some of them want to teach in college.

09:29.150 --> 09:30.932
Of course my graduate students

09:31.570 --> 09:34.613
People who are getting a PhD in English all want to teach in college.

09:35.774 --> 09:46.244
I don't have, when I get the women's novels class, that is not for English majors necessarily.

09:46.264 --> 09:52.930
And I get a lot of people there, a lot of women who are going into business and industry.

09:53.631 --> 09:58.776
I don't, they're going to be personnel managers, I get a lot of psychology majors.

09:59.178 --> 10:01.121
I get mostly women in those classes too.

10:01.281 --> 10:12.517
I would say five to one, because it's rare that a man wants to sign up for all these women's coming of age novels, but I get a few.

10:12.838 --> 10:27.058
As far as you're aware, in terms of offices, salary, promotions, and so forth, have women been treated equitably in recent years in the department?

10:31.865 --> 10:32.586
Not really.

10:32.606 --> 10:36.230
As far as offices and so forth, yes.

10:37.652 --> 10:40.876
And I think Larry Mitchell makes a real effort at this.

10:42.638 --> 10:52.010
But especially in the recent past, there's been quite a bit of discrimination against women, I think.

10:52.831 --> 10:55.054
And it takes funny forms.

11:01.902 --> 11:07.590
And there are a few women in high profile positions, but I'm not sure they have real power.

11:12.816 --> 11:17.162
But I know that the efforts are being made, but there are funny things happen.

11:17.182 --> 11:18.264
For instance, here's an example.

11:18.304 --> 11:24.071
There was some group that was supposed to study the situation and the women's salaries are not as high as the men's.

11:24.091 --> 11:25.413
I mean, there's no question of that.

11:25.934 --> 11:30.660
If you look at the salaries for women, women full professors, for instance,

11:31.872 --> 11:34.616
Now, of course, there are various ways of looking at the information.

11:34.656 --> 11:40.885
If you look at them on a university-wide level, you get something like a $20,000 difference, at least.

11:41.686 --> 11:44.731
And then other people argue, well, the women are in liberal arts.

11:45.912 --> 11:49.478
Of course, part of this is because the women were not really welcomed in those other fields.

11:49.558 --> 11:54.805
And it's still harder for a woman to get tenure in some of these other fields.

11:54.946 --> 11:56.908
I mean, I look at what they did to Lynn Lamoureux.

11:58.611 --> 12:00.073
That was a case.

12:00.172 --> 12:04.495
where she was promised all kinds of things when she came out here and she got none of them.

12:05.892 --> 12:10.960
And then they didn't give her tenure, but of course she got tenure, but she had to go through the legal system.

12:12.462 --> 12:27.125
She was originally, she's now in another department because when they tenured her, when they were told by the law that they had to tenure her or lose something major, they did, but they stuck her in another department.

12:27.145 --> 12:30.550
But I'm sure there's, if you want to look her up, her name is Lamarue.

12:31.458 --> 12:39.827
Now in English, what about, as far as you know, about comparable salaries and promotions and so forth?

12:39.847 --> 12:41.809
I think they're about even in English.

12:42.610 --> 12:44.432
I don't see a real discrepancy.

12:44.733 --> 12:52.261
And as far as you know, when there are recruitment opportunities that there is an effort to be balanced and fair?

12:53.322 --> 12:56.706
Oh, I don't think that, I don't think we even,

12:58.002 --> 12:59.363
make that an issue anymore.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.267
That is, I really think that people are looked at.

13:06.311 --> 13:07.913
I don't think sex plays a role anymore.

13:08.313 --> 13:09.875
I think that we do have a balance.

13:10.255 --> 13:11.717
We may have more women than men.

13:13.499 --> 13:14.580
We brought in some women.

13:14.600 --> 13:19.105
We brought in Jen Swearingen, for instance, at a full professor level.

13:21.708 --> 13:23.790
I don't think that there's a problem with that.

13:24.648 --> 13:37.148
Who, a knowledgeable outsider would know, recognize most, which faculty in English would an outside, informed outsider know most about?

13:37.168 --> 13:40.373
Who are the highest visibility faculty?

13:40.553 --> 13:41.254
Margaret Ezell.

13:41.956 --> 13:42.376
Ezell?

13:42.556 --> 13:42.837
Yes.

13:43.298 --> 13:44.419
In what area?

13:44.520 --> 13:47.444
She is in British literature.

13:48.606 --> 13:49.828
And everybody knows her.

13:50.872 --> 14:04.549
Outside of Margaret, let's see, there are a whole bunch of people that are pretty well known, like Larry Reynolds and, of course, Jerry Loving would go, I think, next to Margaret Izzell, Jerry Loving.

14:04.589 --> 14:05.631
What's his special?

14:05.651 --> 14:12.880
American Lit, and he's got a very well reviewed book about Walt Whitman out.

14:13.260 --> 14:18.567
And I would say probably next to Margaret, the next person to be known would be Jerry.

14:21.196 --> 14:22.698
He's written several books on Whitman.

14:23.379 --> 14:35.896
This one, though, is popular as well as scholarly, and he's been on all the, he was interviewed all over the country by all of these major shows.

14:36.477 --> 14:37.538
Let's see, who else?

14:39.061 --> 14:42.425
Larry, after Margaret and Jerry, then there'd be Larry.

14:43.006 --> 14:46.311
Bedford Clark is pretty well known as a Warren scholar.

14:48.994 --> 14:51.017
Robert Penn Warren, let's see, who else?

14:55.807 --> 14:58.812
Well, Jan Swearingen is known for her work in rhetoric.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.440
I would say those are the people.

15:03.981 --> 15:06.986
Do you have the impression that the department is making progress these days?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.949
Is it getting stronger, getting better?

15:10.171 --> 15:11.814
Yeah, I think it is, actually.

15:11.834 --> 15:12.335
I think it is.

15:12.896 --> 15:15.300
We've lost a bunch of faculty members.

15:17.272 --> 15:21.900
But we've also brought in some very new ones, and certainly in certain areas we're making strides.

15:22.361 --> 15:28.091
We are now extremely multicultural, whereas six years ago we were hardly multicultural at all.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.634
Who deserves credit for that?

15:30.956 --> 15:32.358
Larry Mitchell, I'd have to say.

15:32.959 --> 15:37.407
He is definitely a head, not a chair.

15:38.467 --> 15:51.483
But he has, and I've had a lot of differences with him, but he has, I think, done a lot to make the department multicultural, fairer to women, and so forth.

15:51.863 --> 15:56.288
About how many full-time tenure-track faculty are there now?

16:02.476 --> 16:03.377
Fifty, sixty?

16:05.163 --> 16:07.168
Or between 60 and 70, I'd say.

16:07.569 --> 16:11.518
Yeah, but that's easy enough information to get in the main office.

16:11.599 --> 16:13.223
I don't know it.

16:13.243 --> 16:15.187
And does the department ever get together?

16:16.069 --> 16:17.974
Yes and no.

16:21.329 --> 16:22.311
It gets together.

16:23.452 --> 16:29.903
There's an annual party to welcome the graduate students and I would say a third of the faculty attend.

16:31.025 --> 16:33.669
Larry Mitchell will have a party for the entire faculty.

16:34.070 --> 16:35.512
Two thirds will attend that.

16:37.776 --> 16:47.472
But it doesn't get together because these things are huge crowded parties and you go and you grab your whatever and say hello to everybody and

16:47.857 --> 16:51.344
because it's just too crowded for real conversation.

16:52.065 --> 17:00.601
That is something that is just hard to do, to have real conversations at parties and really get together with your fellow faculty members.

17:01.984 --> 17:08.616
How do you and your faculty friends from whatever department, how do you get together?

17:11.785 --> 17:18.215
My faculty friends and I will have dinner together sometimes at one another's homes.

17:19.898 --> 17:22.662
I used to give parties, but I don't do it anymore.

17:22.702 --> 17:23.984
It seems too much hassle.

17:24.064 --> 17:24.905
And there's more work.

17:24.965 --> 17:25.987
That is one problem.

17:26.007 --> 17:26.748
There is more work.

17:26.768 --> 17:27.569
There are more meetings.

17:29.953 --> 17:33.238
People get so they just want to get shot of all of this.

17:33.439 --> 17:34.660
They don't want to take it home.

17:35.602 --> 17:38.907
But when we do get together, we get together for dinner.

17:39.443 --> 17:43.697
Right, so you're saying that compared to 20, 30 years ago, you're working harder.

17:45.483 --> 17:47.108
Are the students working harder?

17:48.775 --> 17:50.537
No, they're working about the same amount.

17:50.557 --> 17:53.421
About the same.

17:53.441 --> 18:04.795
How would you compare the capability of the student's performance today who gets an A or a B with one who got an A or B 20, 30 years ago?

18:04.955 --> 18:09.240
I would say that the gentleman's C is now the gentleman's B. B?

18:09.541 --> 18:09.641
Yeah.

18:09.781 --> 18:14.547
What I would like to see is the introduction of plus and minus grades.

18:15.691 --> 18:29.297
so that you could still distinguish among A's and B's because most of us on upper level courses, not only throughout the College of Liberal Arts, but in other colleges too, most of the grades are A's and B's, and they didn't used to be.

18:30.319 --> 18:35.910
But you're saying that that A or B doesn't require as much work as it used to?

18:36.717 --> 18:41.562
I don't think it requires as high a level of confidence.

18:41.643 --> 18:42.263
No, I don't.

18:42.283 --> 18:49.672
I think that students that I gave C's to 30 years ago, many of them would now get B's.

18:50.913 --> 18:56.439
And as the students are entering today, are they better prepared from the high school than they used to be?

18:57.781 --> 18:57.981
No.

18:58.562 --> 18:59.062
No, they're not.

18:59.282 --> 19:00.824
They're not?

19:00.844 --> 19:00.964
Oh.

19:01.004 --> 19:02.486
Certainly not in the area of writing skills.

19:02.506 --> 19:06.150
They could write better then.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.565
What major issues do you think A&M should be concerned about today?

19:12.726 --> 19:13.086
Okay.

19:14.728 --> 19:16.330
Multiculturalism and fairness.

19:18.813 --> 19:24.179
How do they work on that?

19:25.401 --> 19:25.861
I don't know.

19:26.322 --> 19:31.007
I know that we're working on it because we have a bunch of new faculty who are

19:33.029 --> 19:36.653
members of minority groups, so we're working on it.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.035
But I don't know.

19:41.418 --> 19:46.284
More needs to be done with the students with this because a lot of students don't have the message.

19:48.226 --> 19:56.455
And yet it can't be done in the form of, I don't think, I don't know how this new program is going to work where people have to take,

19:59.253 --> 20:07.223
Classes, I don't know if this is going to fix things up or not, but I do know something needs to be done because I see some basic racism around.

20:07.243 --> 20:27.690
In a way too, I think we need to, sometimes I think that some of the interest in cross-disciplinary work, multiculturalism and so forth is more cosmetic than real.

20:29.425 --> 20:35.335
And I don't know how to make it more real, but I think it needs to be made more real.

20:39.002 --> 20:39.382
All right, other?

20:40.224 --> 20:43.390
For instance, if you'll turn it off, I'll give you a second.

20:45.453 --> 20:52.005
All right, now we're talking about things that can be done today and some goals that A&M should undertake.

20:53.688 --> 20:53.948
Yeah.

21:03.277 --> 21:07.943
I'm trying to think of other things besides multiculturalism.

21:08.003 --> 21:19.279
There are a lot of initiatives that are being taken that, for instance, there's a lot of movement toward cross-disciplinary work and collaboration.

21:21.041 --> 21:25.647
I think we need to become more international, and we're doing that.

21:28.311 --> 21:29.913
Now what do you mean by international?

21:29.993 --> 21:31.495
I think I know, but I want to be sure.

21:31.643 --> 21:51.303
I mean setting up programs, collaborating with programs overseas, getting overseas collaborations going and of course with Mexico too and I participated in the faculty abroad seminar in Mexico and I thought that was very good.

21:51.763 --> 21:58.190
Should we give more encouragement for students to learn a second language?

21:58.210 --> 22:00.672
Yes, I think that we need to give more

22:02.221 --> 22:06.526
More than encouragement, I think it should be required that everybody learn a second language.

22:07.286 --> 22:14.374
If I could be the emperor, I would make that a baccalaureate degree requirement for the modern world.

22:17.317 --> 22:26.507
And in fact, though, I think that we are taking steps in this direction, but I think that, yes, we need to encourage

22:26.993 --> 22:30.378
everyone to become more aware of other cultures and to learn about them.

22:30.939 --> 22:38.971
I remember reading that report where somebody said something to the effect that they couldn't send Aggies to New York let alone to Japan or something like that.

22:39.111 --> 22:42.596
We need to make it so that Aggies can go anywhere and know how to behave.

22:43.578 --> 22:47.604
Is there any school or program you can think of that we might use as a model?

22:48.746 --> 22:50.368
Is there any institution that is

22:51.749 --> 23:01.721
I think we have to make up our own direction for this because there are a lot of different things that work, but they have to do with particular institutions.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.945
I don't think that we could adopt somebody else's program.

23:05.686 --> 23:07.408
What should the department's goals be?

23:08.650 --> 23:09.791
The English department's goals?

23:09.972 --> 23:10.312
Okay.

23:10.793 --> 23:19.984
I think we should strengthen our master's program and introduce an attractive professional writing program.

23:21.162 --> 23:30.472
We should be willing to provide, help teachers in the high school, get masters in English.

23:31.693 --> 23:40.582
Because I think that we've got a situation kind of where the tail's wagging the dog with the Texas Education Association, they're dictating to us what we should be teaching.

23:41.463 --> 23:45.007
And they're not having the right, they don't have the right emphases.

23:45.627 --> 23:47.389
I think we need to work on that.

23:50.390 --> 23:53.254
I think we need to strengthen linguistics.

23:54.075 --> 23:55.937
I think we need to strengthen creative writing.

23:58.020 --> 24:04.087
It always, I always thought that creative writing was a wonderful possibility for bringing in multicultural people, but we've never done it.

24:04.167 --> 24:10.996
We did have Gordone that we, and we kind of inherited him from theater arts.

24:11.016 --> 24:18.405
He didn't come to us originally, I don't believe, I'm not sure, but he was very definitely an asset while we had him.

24:19.803 --> 24:27.057
And we could, for instance, since he died, there's been nobody to teach playwriting.

24:28.320 --> 24:33.730
We have this whole, we don't have a program in creative writing, but we do have a track, and it's got a missing stair.

24:35.013 --> 24:39.381
So this would be a wonderful opportunity to bring in a Hispanic or black playwright

24:41.318 --> 24:49.746
But this won't happen because our emphasis is very much on literary scholarship of a particular sort, essentially theory.

24:50.147 --> 25:03.140
And I think we need to, everybody else in the department will tell you differently, but I think that we should focus less on theory and more on these other areas so that we are a strong department across the board.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.263
We don't just have strong theory contingent.

25:08.065 --> 25:10.007
Your personal goals?

25:10.608 --> 25:11.409
My personal goals?

25:12.310 --> 25:17.295
Well, for my scholarship, you mean?

25:18.477 --> 25:20.399
For your professional?

25:21.140 --> 25:22.922
For my professional development, okay.

25:23.362 --> 25:26.606
Well, I do anthologies.

25:26.746 --> 25:30.310
I've done two of them with someone else, and I'm working on a third one myself.

25:31.972 --> 25:37.178
I'd like to put together a really good anthology of poetry.

25:38.558 --> 25:41.161
I also have my own poetry collections.

25:41.462 --> 25:53.216
I'd like to get one of these published by a well-known press, because so far I've only been able to interest small press in my work.

25:55.499 --> 26:01.386
I have a kind of strange project that is a book of poetry based on letters.

26:01.466 --> 26:02.888
I have a collection of letters.

26:02.968 --> 26:06.793
I collect old letters, and this is a collection of letters written by

26:08.849 --> 26:13.219
by members of, by the two halves of a courting couple in 1830.

26:15.043 --> 26:19.774
And they get married, they have children, then they become family letters.

26:20.275 --> 26:27.111
Somebody kept these letters that start actually in 1828 and end in 1863, I think is the last one.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.684
And I've done poems that are dramatic monologues based on these letters.

26:33.066 --> 26:42.796
And I'm also trying to fill some history in some of the groups that they refer to, some of the journals and so forth.

26:42.836 --> 26:46.880
I'm trying to find out more information about these to put little historical bridges in.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.062
And I want to get somebody interested in printing this.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.445
It's fascinating.

26:51.425 --> 27:06.085
the way you can see into this couple from this perspective and how they lived because they wrote meticulously detailed letters of how they lived, what they had for lunch.

27:07.147 --> 27:16.740
He was a school teacher who later became a Baptist minister, I believe, after the sequence of letters was finished.

27:18.863 --> 27:21.407
Most of the letters are actually from the courting period.

27:22.509 --> 27:28.640
And it's just interesting to see what courtship between very religious people was like at that time.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.767
Of course, I've got a lot of other letters from that time in my collection.

27:33.408 --> 27:34.189
And religion.

27:34.372 --> 27:40.199
Christianity was very definitely woven into the fabric of lives the way it is not now.

27:41.140 --> 27:47.168
All decisions were referred to providence and biblical injustices.

27:48.450 --> 28:02.747
And it's just because you can see how that works.

28:02.767 --> 28:03.128
What's the belief?

28:03.148 --> 28:03.248
Sure.

28:05.793 --> 28:26.934
Well, up beyond the College of Liberal Arts, I usually, I won't go because I don't know anything.

28:26.954 --> 28:30.838
But I would say the first thing that the Liberal Arts could do is to hire a good dean for an archive.

28:31.561 --> 28:48.329
and we've got a Dean Church going on there, I think.

28:48.350 --> 28:50.493
And we need to bring in somebody who's really good to this and he'll come out here and he'll go to college.

28:50.513 --> 28:51.355
And aside from that, I'd like to see more.

28:51.375 --> 28:51.475
Okay.

28:51.495 --> 28:51.595
Okay.

28:52.756 --> 29:19.505
He should be, he personally should be somebody who is interested in multiculturalism and new directions of violence, but he should not be, I wrote the local video to somebody else.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.767
He should be somebody who's going to be fair to all departments and not just the departments that he comes from.

29:24.329 --> 29:40.931
Somebody who is familiar with interdisciplinary work, let me do that kind of statement now, P or C, and I'd like to say C, of course.

29:40.951 --> 29:50.083
I should be somebody who's interested in looking at how women are treated in college.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.395
No, I don't know.

29:52.635 --> 29:55.558
My department, as I said, I don't see anything unfair.

29:56.239 --> 30:02.246
However, I know people who are competing very fairly in other departments, I believe.

30:02.826 --> 30:14.019
So he should be able to kind of reset these switches in those departments.

30:14.039 --> 30:15.460
From what kind of institution should this person have that experience?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.843
I would say in a large state institution.

30:19.763 --> 30:36.386
Yeah, we wouldn't do well with somebody who had to deal with only small numbers.

30:36.406 --> 30:37.187
Right now, you're advising the provost.

30:37.207 --> 30:38.228
What consulting advisor would you give the provost?

30:38.933 --> 30:41.937
I don't even know what the provost does.

30:41.957 --> 30:42.457
He's there.

30:42.578 --> 30:44.220
What did he do?

30:44.240 --> 30:48.325
If you tell me what he does, maybe I can get some suggestions.

30:48.345 --> 30:48.846
What about the president?

30:48.866 --> 30:51.689
Again, I don't know what their functions are.

30:54.373 --> 30:59.099
What direction should the president be in this institution?

30:59.119 --> 31:08.130
I think in the direction of increasing the number of faculty all across the board.

31:08.870 --> 31:11.295
of reducing the number of large.

31:11.315 --> 31:14.180
This is done, I know, for financial reasons.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.403
They have these huge courses.

31:15.944 --> 31:24.280
I think these should be reduced to a very few courses, and those should be only the most basic courses.
