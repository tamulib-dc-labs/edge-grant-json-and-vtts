WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:08.755
So he kind of had two conflicting things going at 
once. One, he was trying to enlarge the service

00:09.215 --> 00:14.122
component of the department. And to this end, he 
hired technical writing people. However, he was

00:21.131 --> 00:29.042
also, in a less pronounced way, trying to expand 
the literary offerings. And we did acquire a bunch

00:29.798 --> 00:34.064
of good people when he was head. From what 
institutions? Oh, gee, I don't know. These new

00:40.974 --> 00:43.158
PhDs? These were new PhDs and they were from all 
over. Naturally, we have always had a bunch of

00:47.143 --> 00:53.713
people from UT, but they came from all over the 
country. And as far as you were aware, did we begin

00:54.655 --> 01:03.106
to be competitive in our beginning salaries for 
these new?

01:07.512 --> 01:19.868
I can't say because I only have a sense of what we 
were offering as opposed to what other places were

01:07.512 --> 01:19.868
offering, but I would say yes, we could not have 
brought some of these people here if we hadn't been

01:07.512 --> 01:19.868
offering what other places were offering. And the 
graduate program, how was it changing? It was

01:24.389 --> 01:29.168
getting better students.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.762
It was getting more and better students. And this 
is what I want to see more of even now. The master's

01:36.807 --> 01:41.854
program was developing as a separate entity, 
which it should be. And I think that recently we've

01:42.234 --> 01:47.882
kind of sacrificed the master's program to the PhD 
program. We don't have that many students coming

01:48.242 --> 01:51.807
through anymore getting masters and finding 
jobs. And I want to see this. If we have to offer a

01:54.330 --> 01:59.577
degree in professional writing or something, I'd 
like to see us get back our master's program. Were

02:00.637 --> 02:04.963
there any opportunities missed back there in the 
80s and 90s? Some things that could have been done

02:06.865 --> 02:09.088
that weren't? For one thing, we did not have much in 
the way of multiculturalism at all. I'm sure that

02:17.639 --> 02:19.842
opportunities were missed there.

02:24.328 --> 02:29.395
Lately, there's been a lot of cross-disciplinary 
action But we could have done that earlier, and

02:30.235 --> 02:36.147
some of us tried to, and it was not, it was frowned 
on. It was very hard to, for instance, get

02:36.268 --> 02:43.262
something going, teach something or get apparel 
courses going. Can you give an example of one that

02:43.683 --> 02:46.790
you or someone attempted to? Oh.

02:53.388 --> 03:05.425
I remember attempting to start an adolescent 
psychology and the adolescent novel course, and

02:53.388 --> 03:05.425
the hurdles seemed just too great to pursue that 
project. I don't remember how far we got with it,

03:05.605 --> 03:14.417
but it looked as though this just couldn't be done, 
and so maybe it could have if we pushed it, but we

03:05.605 --> 03:14.417
didn't. What became your normal routine of 
teaching? What courses? Well, I slipped into

03:18.723 --> 03:22.708
creative writing because that's what I've always 
been most interested in. And, oh, I guess I first

03:22.728 --> 03:29.218
had the chance to teach that about 12 years ago. And 
there has been more and more demand for it. The core

03:34.385 --> 03:42.396
curriculum allows some people, like in 
education, to take it as a quasi-recurrent.

03:42.713 --> 03:46.519
requirement, that is, they have the choice of 
creative writing or some other things. And we

03:47.420 --> 03:56.034
just, we divided into poetry and prose instead of 
just teaching it all together, and it really took

03:47.420 --> 03:56.034
off. Now, for instance, this semester I have 
exclusively creative writing classes. How many?

04:02.504 --> 04:02.604
Two. But two creative writing classes makes for a 
lot of work because each ego is involved. It's

04:13.304 --> 04:22.078
teaching more to teach two creative writing 
classes than it is to teach more students in a lit

04:13.304 --> 04:22.078
class because the lit students, you're not 
grating their souls. So my

04:23.480 --> 04:29.990
normal routine now is teaching creative writing 
and women's novels. And these are both

04:31.432 --> 04:34.978
upper-level undergraduate? No, they can be 
either lower level. For instance, one of my

04:38.257 --> 04:43.326
creative writing classes is 226, which is 
essentially a sophomore level class. It'll have

04:43.426 --> 04:47.393
freshmen in it too because they pass that, they 
place out of the freshman class. About how many per

04:47.653 --> 04:48.875
section? 25. And then the, let's see, you 
mentioned another, other than creative writing,

04:52.100 --> 04:57.469
you mentioned another. Women's novels. Women's 
novels. I have either 45 or 35 in there, depending

04:59.917 --> 05:04.302
on which level it is. And that's upper level? 
That's upper level. It's either 374 or 474. In that

05:09.609 --> 05:13.994
course, what are your favorite novels that you 
urge them to read? Okay, we read Sylvia Plath's The

05:14.474 --> 05:16.977
Bell Jar. We read Maxine Hong Kingston's Woman 
Warrior. We read Toni Morrison's Beloved.

05:24.767 --> 05:25.608
Let's see, what else? We read... Kate Chopin's The 
Awakening. Very often we start with Jane Eyre,

05:33.461 --> 05:37.625
because I always teach it the same way. I teach it as 
The Buildings Roman, which is the novel of

05:37.665 --> 05:41.989
development or education. And so I use only novels 
which show either coming of age or a learning

05:42.930 --> 05:49.696
experience at some other point in life. So often we 
use as our basic example that... Jane Eyre, and

05:58.608 --> 06:05.638
then proceed through more contemporary ones up 
till the latest ones. And for you, you are now one of

06:07.480 --> 06:14.751
about how many women on the faculty in English? A 
lot. I would say that the faculty is about half

06:18.536 --> 06:22.482
male, half female, but I don't know. And are they, 
are there some minority also? Yes, we have quite a

06:28.645 --> 06:30.607
few now. We have, let's see, we've got Peaches 
Henry coming in. She's on some sort of odd

06:34.771 --> 06:39.676
fellowship for this year. What was her first name? 
Peaches. I thought you said Peaches. Peaches

06:42.779 --> 06:43.579
Henry. And we hired her away from Notre Dame. We've 
got, okay,

06:46.122 --> 06:52.688
Kamla Dutey is new. She's a visiting assistant 
professor. We have Kimberly Brown. Let's see. No,

06:59.631 --> 07:00.292
that's two. We have Kimberly Brown. All these are 
African Americans. Oh,

07:03.456 --> 07:09.345
gosh, I can't remember his name. We have four, five 
if you count Peaches, I believe, African American

07:10.106 --> 07:15.214
faculty. And then we have Marco Patales. It kind of 
surprises me a little that we are not able to get and

07:19.760 --> 07:26.733
keep many Hispanic faculty. We have had better 
luck with African Americans, and I don't really

07:27.475 --> 07:33.767
understand that because here we are, but I guess 
they don't want to come to Cutler Station.

07:37.053 --> 07:40.620
Compare the students now and the students... 
Okay, now there are students, I get students from

07:40.769 --> 07:45.995
all cultures at least. I get about an equal balance 
of male and female students, maybe even a few more

07:46.936 --> 07:53.804
women students because I teach poetry writing. 
The fiction people get a few more men.

08:01.853 --> 08:04.916
The students are less likely to do what I say. They 
don't call me ma'am. They're more likely to What do

08:09.170 --> 08:10.732
they call you? They call me Professor McCann or Dr. 
McCann.

08:16.018 --> 08:20.644
Actually, I'd like to encourage my graduate 
students to call me by my first name, but they don't

08:16.018 --> 08:20.644
do it. They're

08:20.664 --> 08:32.037
more intellectually involved, many of them.

08:36.042 --> 08:38.485
But I'm not teaching the same things. And if I were 
teaching freshmen now, I might find them a lot.

08:44.167 --> 08:48.052
That is, they would be multicultural and there 
would be a lot of women. But they too might think of

08:48.793 --> 08:55.201
the class as something to be got through as opposed 
to something that they're passionately

08:48.793 --> 08:55.201
interested in. People don't take creative 
writing unless they're interested. So I don't

08:58.005 --> 09:01.990
have sleeping students the way I used to. But they 
would be very polite when awakened back then. What

09:07.017 --> 09:09.400
are their career goals today? An

09:10.308 --> 09:16.939
awful lot of them want to teach. Some of them want to 
teach in high schools. My undergraduates, some of

09:20.605 --> 09:23.790
them want to teach in high schools, and I think 
that's great. We certainly need people teaching

09:24.551 --> 09:26.454
in high schools. Some of them want to teach in 
college. Of course, my graduate students, people

09:29.158 --> 09:34.667
who are getting a PhD in English, all want to teach 
in college. I don't have

09:40.936 --> 09:52.970
When I get the women's novels class, that is not for 
English majors necessarily, and I get a lot of

09:40.936 --> 09:52.970
people there, a lot of women who are going into 
business and industry. I don't, they're going to

09:53.651 --> 09:58.176
be personnel managers, I get a lot of psychology 
majors. I get mostly women in those classes too, I

09:59.338 --> 10:08.749
would say five to one, because it's rare that a man 
wants to sign up for all these women's coming of age

09:59.338 --> 10:08.749
novels, but I get a few. As far as you're aware, in 
terms of offices,

10:10.552 --> 10:32.042
salary, promotions, and so forth, have women been 
treated equitably in recent years in the

10:10.552 --> 10:32.042
department?

10:32.062 --> 10:32.623
Not really. As far as offices and so forth, yes. And 
I think Larry Mitchell makes a real effort at this.

10:42.654 --> 10:52.027
But

10:42.654 --> 10:52.027
especially in the recent past, there's been quite 
a bit of discrimination against women, I think.

10:52.849 --> 10:54.391
And it takes funny forms.

11:02.142 --> 11:04.605
There are a few women in high-profile positions. 
but I'm not sure they have real power.

11:12.842 --> 11:15.225
But I know that the efforts are being made. Funny 
things happen. For instance, here's an example.

11:18.330 --> 11:24.078
There was some group that was supposed to study the 
situation, and the women's salaries are not as

11:18.330 --> 11:24.078
high as the men's. I mean, there's no question of 
that. If you look at the salaries for women, women

11:25.961 --> 11:30.547
full professors, for instance. Now, of course, 
there are various ways of looking at the

11:31.989 --> 11:34.673
information. If you look at them on a On a 
university-wide level, you get something like a

11:36.344 --> 11:40.891
$20,000 difference at least. And then other 
people argue, well, the women are in liberal arts.

11:45.919 --> 11:54.833
Of course, part of this is because the women were 
not really welcomed in those other fields, and

11:45.919 --> 11:54.833
it's still harder for a woman to get tenure in some 
of these other fields. I mean, I look at what they

11:54.953 --> 11:56.916
did to Lynn Lamoureux. That was a case where she was 
promised all kinds of things when she came out

11:58.639 --> 12:04.528
here, and she got none of them. And then they didn't 
give her tenure, but of course she got tenure, but

12:05.926 --> 12:10.994
she had to go through the legal system. She was 
originally, she's now in another department

12:12.497 --> 12:26.160
because when they tenured her, when they were told 
by the law that they had to tenure her or lose

12:12.497 --> 12:26.160
something major, they did, but they stuck her in 
another department. But I'm sure there's, if you

12:27.181 --> 12:30.567
want to look her up, her name is Lamoureux. Now, in 
English, what about, as far as you know, about

12:31.475 --> 12:39.845
comparable salaries and promotions and so forth? 
I think they're about even in English. I don't see a

12:42.649 --> 12:44.471
real discrepancy. And as far as you know, when 
there are recruitment opportunities, that there

12:44.751 --> 12:52.281
is an effort to be balanced and fair? Oh, I don't 
think that... I don't think we even... make that an

12:58.036 --> 12:59.358
issue anymore. That is, I really think that people 
are looked at...

13:06.327 --> 13:07.969
I don't think sex plays a role anymore. I think that 
we do have a balance. We may have more women than

13:10.292 --> 13:11.754
men. We brought in some women. We brought in Jen 
Swearengen, for instance, at a full professor

13:14.678 --> 13:19.123
level. I don't think that there's a problem with 
that. A knowledgeable outsider... would

13:27.770 --> 13:37.163
recognize most, which faculty in English would an 
outside, informed outsider know most about? Who

13:37.183 --> 13:40.387
are the highest visibility faculty? Margaret 
Ezell. Ezell? Yes. She is in British literature,

13:44.533 --> 13:49.700
and everybody knows her. Outside of Margaret's, 
let's see, there are a whole bunch of people that

13:51.462 --> 13:55.988
are pretty well-known. like Larry Reynolds. Of 
course, Jerry Loving would go, I think, next to

13:58.602 --> 14:03.870
Margaret Izzell. Jerry Loving, he's American 
Lit, and he's got a very well-reviewed

14:03.890 --> 14:12.922
book about Walt Whitman out. And I would say 
probably next to Margaret, the next person to be

14:13.283 --> 14:18.550
known would be Jerry.

14:21.230 --> 14:22.751
He's written several books on Whitman. This one, 
though, is popular as well as scholarly. And he's

14:27.476 --> 14:35.903
been on all the, he was interviewed all over the 
country by all these major shows. Let's see, who

14:36.484 --> 14:37.525
else? Larry, after Margaret and Jerry, then 
there'd be Larry. Bedford Clark is pretty well

14:43.010 --> 14:46.333
known as a Warren scholar.

14:49.015 --> 14:51.017
Robert Penn Warren, let's see, who else?

14:55.874 --> 14:58.838
Well, Jan Swearengin is known for her work in 
rhetoric.

15:02.343 --> 15:03.444
I would say those are the people. Do you have the 
impression that the department is making

15:04.005 --> 15:07.009
progress these days? Is it getting stronger, 
getting better? Yeah, I think it is, actually. I

15:11.855 --> 15:12.356
think it is. We've lost a bunch of faculty members. 
But we've also brought in some very new ones, and

15:17.288 --> 15:21.935
certainly in certain areas we're making strides. 
We are now extremely multicultural, whereas six

15:22.375 --> 15:28.104
years ago we were hardly multicultural at all. Who 
deserves credit for that? Larry Mitchell, I'd

15:30.968 --> 15:32.390
have to say. He is definitely a head, not a chair. 
But he has, and I've had a lot of differences with

15:38.659 --> 15:46.350
him, but he has, I think, done a lot to make the 
department multicultural, fairer to women, and

15:46.803 --> 15:51.509
so forth. About how many full-time tenure track 
faculty are there now?

16:02.502 --> 16:03.323
50, 60? Or between 60 and 70, I'd say. Yeah, but 
that's easy enough information to get in the main

16:07.629 --> 16:11.553
office. I don't know it. And does the department 
ever get together? Yes and no. It

16:17.335 --> 16:22.341
gets together. There's an annual party to welcome 
the graduate students and I would say a third of the

16:23.422 --> 16:29.931
faculty attend. Larry Mitchell will have a party 
for the entire faculty. Two-thirds will attend

16:34.096 --> 16:35.538
that. But it doesn't get together because these 
things are huge crowded parties and you go and you

16:37.801 --> 16:43.388
grab your whatever, and say hello to everybody and 
slither out the other door because it's just too

16:44.431 --> 16:51.382
crowded for real conversation. That is something 
that it's just hard to do, to have real

16:52.103 --> 17:00.617
conversations at parties and really get together 
with your fellow faculty members. How do you and

17:02.019 --> 17:06.467
your faculty friends from whatever department, 
how do you get together? I would say that

17:11.819 --> 17:18.226
My faculty friends and I will have dinner together 
sometimes at one another's homes. I used to give

17:19.928 --> 17:22.691
parties, but I don't do it anymore. It seems too 
much hassle. And there's more work. That is one

17:24.973 --> 17:26.014
problem. There is more work. There are more 
meetings. People get so they just want to get a shot

17:29.978 --> 17:33.282
of all of this. They don't want to take it home. But 
when we do get together, we get together for

17:35.604 --> 17:39.008
dinner. Right, so you're saying that compared to 
20, 30 years ago, you're working harder. Are the

17:45.510 --> 17:47.052
students working harder? No, they're working 
about the same amount. How would you compare the

17:53.482 --> 18:00.253
capability of the student's performance today 
who gets an A or a B with one who got an A or B 20, 30

18:00.655 --> 18:04.800
years ago? I would say that the gentleman C is now 
the gentleman B. B? Yeah. What I would like to see is

18:09.787 --> 18:29.413
the introduction of plus and minus grades so that 
you could still distinguish among A's and B's

18:09.787 --> 18:29.413
because most of us in upper level courses, not only 
throughout the College of Liberal Arts, but in

18:09.787 --> 18:29.413
other colleges too, most of the grades are A's and 
B's, and they didn't used to be. But you're saying

18:30.220 --> 18:35.787
that that A or B doesn't require as much work as it 
used to? I don't think it requires as high a level of

18:37.369 --> 18:41.594
confidence. No, I don't. I think that students 
that I gave C's to 30 years ago, many of them would

18:42.556 --> 18:49.705
now get B's. And as the students are entering 
today, are they better prepared from the high

18:50.946 --> 18:56.233
school that they used to be? No. No, they're not. 
They're not? Oh. Certainly not in the area of

19:00.663 --> 19:02.485
writing skills. They could write better then.

19:07.610 --> 19:11.615
What major issues do you think A&M should be 
concerned about today? Okay. Multiculturalism

19:14.758 --> 19:16.360
and fairness. How

19:18.882 --> 19:24.208
do they work on that? I don't know. I know that we're 
working on it because we have a bunch of new faculty

19:29.452 --> 19:56.505
who are members of minority groups so we're 
working on it but I don't know more

19:29.452 --> 19:56.505
needs to be done with the students with this 
because a lot of students don't have the message

19:29.452 --> 19:56.505
and yet it can't be done in the form of I don't think I 
don't I don't know how this new program is going to

19:29.452 --> 19:56.505
work where people have to take

19:59.287 --> 20:00.028
Classes. I don't know if this is going to fix things 
up or not, but I do know something needs to be done

20:00.469 --> 20:07.259
because I see some basic racism around. In

20:07.299 --> 20:16.874
a way, too, I think we need to... Sometimes I think 
that some of the interest in cross-disciplinary

20:17.915 --> 20:27.690
work, multiculturalism and so forth, is more 
cosmetic than real. And I don't know how to make it

20:29.459 --> 20:35.368
more real, but I think it needs to be made more real.

20:40.236 --> 20:45.525
For instance, if you'll turn it off, I'll give you a 
second. Right now we're talking about things that

20:45.545 --> 20:53.998
can be done today and some goals that A&M should 
undertake.

21:03.310 --> 21:07.976
I'm trying to think of other things besides 
multiculturalism. There are a lot of initiatives

21:08.577 --> 21:11.481
that are being taken. For instance, there's a lot 
of movement toward cross-disciplinary work and

21:12.542 --> 21:19.312
collaboration. I think we need to become more 
international, and we're doing that. Now, what do

21:28.324 --> 21:29.926
you mean by international? I think I know, but I 
want to be sure. I mean, setting up programs,

21:31.677 --> 21:51.321
collaborating with programs overseas, getting 
overseas collaborations going, and of course in

21:31.677 --> 21:51.321
Mexico too, and I participated in the faculty 
abroad seminar in Mexico, and I thought that was

21:31.677 --> 21:51.321
very good. Should we give more encouragement for 
students to learn a second language? Yes, I think

21:58.229 --> 22:00.672
that we need to give more More than encouragement, 
I think it should be required that everybody learn

22:02.238 --> 22:06.563
a second language. If I could be the emperor, I 
would make that a baccalaureate degree

22:07.304 --> 22:11.670
requirement. Yeah. For the modern world.

22:17.357 --> 22:30.473
And in fact, though, I think that we are taking 
steps in this direction, but I think that, yes, we

22:17.357 --> 22:30.473
need to encourage everyone to become more aware of 
other cultures and to learn about them I remember

22:30.892 --> 22:39.002
reading that report where somebody said 
something to the effect that they couldn't send

22:30.892 --> 22:39.002
Aggies to New York, let alone to Japan or something 
like that. We need to make it so that Aggies can go

22:39.122 --> 22:42.587
anywhere and know how to behave. Is there any 
school or program you can think of that we might use

22:43.608 --> 22:47.653
as a model? Is there any institution that is... I 
think we have to make up our own direction for this

22:51.898 --> 22:59.127
because there are a lot of different things that 
work, but... They have to do with particular

22:59.630 --> 23:01.732
institutions. I don't think that we could adopt 
somebody else's program. What should the

23:05.697 --> 23:07.439
department's goals be? The English department's 
goals? Okay. I think we should strengthen our

23:10.803 --> 23:19.933
master's program and introduce

23:10.803 --> 23:19.933
an attractive professional writing program. We 
should be willing to

23:21.415 --> 23:28.843
provide, help teachers in the high schools get 
masters in English because I think that we've got a

23:29.043 --> 23:37.953
situation kind of where the tail's wagging the dog 
with the Texas Education Association. They're

23:37.973 --> 23:45.041
dictating to us what we should be teaching and 
they're not having the right, they don't have the

23:37.973 --> 23:45.041
right emphases. I think we need to work on that.

23:50.567 --> 23:54.091
I think we need to strengthen linguistics. I think 
we need to strengthen creative writing. I always

23:57.038 --> 24:04.111
thought that creative writing was a wonderful 
possibility for bringing in multicultural

23:57.038 --> 24:04.111
people, but we've never done it. We did have 
Gordon, and we kind of inherited him from theater

24:04.191 --> 24:09.961
arts. He didn't come to us originally, I don't 
believe, I'm not sure, but he was very definitely

24:11.043 --> 24:21.021
an asset while we had him.

24:22.908 --> 24:27.072
We could, for instance, since he died, there's 
been nobody to teach playwriting. We have this

24:28.333 --> 24:33.778
whole, we don't have a program in creative 
writing, but we do have a track and it's got a

24:28.333 --> 24:33.778
missing stare. So this would be a wonderful 
opportunity to bring in a Hispanic or black

24:35.019 --> 24:39.343
playwright. But this won't happen because our 
emphasis is very much on literary scholarship of a

24:41.425 --> 24:49.772
particular sort, essentially theory. And I think 
we need to Everybody else in the department will

24:53.435 --> 25:03.150
tell you differently, but I think that we should 
focus less on theory and more on these other areas

24:53.435 --> 25:03.150
so that we are a strong department across the 
board. We don't just have strong theory

25:03.251 --> 25:06.275
contingent.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.061
Your personal goals. My personal goals. Well,

25:12.345 --> 25:17.373
for my scholarship, you mean? For your 
professional goals. For my professional

25:21.127 --> 25:22.949
development, okay. Well, I do anthologies. I've 
done two of them with someone else, and I'm working

25:26.775 --> 25:30.319
on a third one myself. I'd like to put together a 
really good anthology of poetry. I also have my own

25:38.871 --> 25:41.194
poetry collections. I'd like to get one of these 
published by a well-known press. So far, I've only

25:48.304 --> 25:50.627
been able to interest small press in my work. I have 
a kind of strange project that is a book of poetry

25:55.495 --> 26:01.384
based on letters. I have a collection of letters. I 
collect old letters. And this is a collection of

26:04.268 --> 26:13.262
letters written by the

26:04.268 --> 26:13.262
two halves of a courting couple in 1830. And they 
get married. They have children. Then they become

26:18.113 --> 26:19.796
family letters. Somebody kept these letters that 
start actually in 1828 and end in 1863 I think is the

26:20.276 --> 26:27.007
last one. And I've done poems that are dramatic 
monologues based on these letters. And I'm also

26:33.096 --> 26:37.843
trying to fill some history in. some of the groups 
that they refer to, some of the journals and so

26:38.380 --> 26:42.827
forth. I'm trying to find out more information 
about these to put little historical bridges in.

26:47.315 --> 26:49.098
And I want to get somebody interested in printing 
this. It's fascinating the way you can see into

26:49.699 --> 26:59.275
this couple from this perspective and how they 
lived because They wrote meticulously detailed

26:59.947 --> 27:06.095
letters of how they lived, what they had for lunch. 
He was a schoolteacher who later became a Baptist

27:07.157 --> 27:14.828
minister, I believe, after the sequence of 
letters was finished. And

27:15.989 --> 27:21.437
most of the letters are actually from the courting 
period. And it's just interesting to see what

27:22.578 --> 27:28.907
courtship between very religious people was like 
at that time. Of course, I've got a lot of other

27:29.208 --> 27:32.792
letters from that time in my collection. And 
religion, Christianity was very definitely

27:33.393 --> 27:40.240
woven into the fabric of lives the way it is not now. 
All decisions were referred to Providence. And

27:44.205 --> 27:57.139
biblical...

28:01.152 --> 28:28.236
Well,

28:01.152 --> 28:28.236
up beyond the College of Liberal Arts, I usually, I 
won't go because I don't know anything. But I would

28:28.256 --> 28:30.838
say the first thing that the Liberal Arts could do 
is to hire a big team from Hawthorne. And

28:31.544 --> 28:48.622
we've got research going on there, actually. And 
we need to bring in somebody, a really good

28:48.642 --> 28:50.366
student, so he can come out here and . And aside from 
that, I'd like to see more. OK. He

28:52.857 --> 29:17.926
should be, first of all, he should be somebody who 
is interested in multiculturalism and new

28:52.857 --> 29:17.926
directions of thought. But he should not be, I look 
over here to see if somebody knows. He should be

29:19.247 --> 29:21.470
somebody who's going to be fair to all departments 
and not just the department that he comes from. He

29:21.490 --> 29:21.750
should be, I should be somebody

29:24.413 --> 29:50.033
who

29:24.413 --> 29:50.033
is interested in looking at

29:24.413 --> 29:50.033
how women are treated in college. No, I don't know. 
My department, as I said, I don't see anything

29:52.670 --> 29:56.256
there. However, I know people who have competed 
very fairly in other departments. I believe he

30:00.001 --> 30:02.305
took very well. So he should be able to kind of reset 
these switches in

30:02.866 --> 30:14.545
those departments. From what kind of institution 
to this person? I would say in a large-state

30:15.486 --> 30:17.910
institution. We wouldn't do well with somebody 
who had to deal with only small numbers.

30:36.442 --> 30:37.223
Right now, you're advising the provost. What 
consulting advice would you give the provost? I

30:38.967 --> 30:41.952
don't even know what trouble he's done. He's 
there. What did he do? If you tell me what he does,

30:44.275 --> 30:48.862
maybe I can get some suggestions. Again, I don't 
know what their functions are. What direction

30:54.390 --> 30:59.418
should the

30:54.390 --> 30:59.418
president be in this institution? I think in the 
direction of

30:59.498 --> 31:07.911
increasing the number of faculty all across the 
board. of reducing the number of large, this is

31:08.903 --> 31:13.974
done, I know, for financial reasons. They have 
these huge courses. I think these should be

31:15.959 --> 31:19.046
reduced to very few courses. I think those should 
be only the most basic courses.
