WEBVTT

00:02.760 --> 00:08.780
So he kind of had two conflicting things going at 
once. One, he was trying to enlarge the service

00:08.760 --> 00:13.980
component of the department. And to this end, he 
hired technical writing people. However, he was

00:21.060 --> 00:24.500
also, in a less pronounced way, trying to expand 
the literary offerings. And we did acquire a bunch

00:28.780 --> 00:34.080
of good people when he was head. From what 
institutions? Oh, gee, I don't know. Were these

00:41.280 --> 00:43.220
new PhDs? These were new PhDs, and they were from 
all over. Naturally, we have always had a bunch of

00:46.960 --> 00:50.860
people from UT, but they came from all over the 
country. And as far as you were aware, did we begin

00:54.340 --> 00:59.300
to be competitive? In our beginning salaries for 
these new...

01:07.000 --> 01:10.860
I can't say because I only have a sense of what we 
were offering as opposed to what other places were

01:10.840 --> 01:14.020
offering. But I would say, yes, we could not have 
brought some of these people here if we hadn't been

01:17.080 --> 01:19.780
offering what other places were offering. And the 
graduate program, how was it changing? It was

01:24.300 --> 01:27.400
getting better students. It

01:28.200 --> 01:32.730
was getting more and better students. This is what 
I want to see more of even now. The master's program

01:36.770 --> 01:40.910
was developing as a separate entity, which it 
should be. And I think that recently we've kind of

01:42.170 --> 01:46.390
sacrificed the master's program to the PhD 
program. We don't have that many students coming

01:48.070 --> 01:50.150
through anymore getting masters and finding 
jobs. And I want to see this. If we have to offer a

01:54.210 --> 01:56.790
degree in professional writing or something, I'd 
like to see us get back our master's program. Were

02:00.750 --> 02:04.070
there any opportunities missed back there in the 
80s? Some things that could have been done that

02:04.190 --> 02:09.080
weren't? For one thing, we did not have much in the 
way of multiculturalism at all. I'm sure that

02:17.240 --> 02:19.740
opportunities were missed there.

02:24.060 --> 02:29.200
Lately, there's been a lot of cross-disciplinary 
action. But we could have done that earlier, and

02:30.180 --> 02:33.260
some of us tried to, and it was frowned on. It was 
very hard to, for instance, get something going,

02:39.660 --> 02:43.200
teach something, or get a pair of courses going. 
Can you give an example of one that you or someone

02:43.520 --> 02:46.740
attempted to? Oh,

02:47.640 --> 02:58.060
I remember attempting to start an adolescent 
psychology and the adolescent novel course, and

02:59.940 --> 03:05.200
the hurdles seemed just too great to pursue that 
project. I don't remember how far we got with it,

03:08.080 --> 03:11.320
but it looked as though this just couldn't be done. 
And so maybe it could have if we pushed it, but we

03:13.480 --> 03:14.501
didn't. What became your normal routine of 
teaching? What courses? Well, I slipped into

03:18.635 --> 03:20.500
creative writing, because that's what I've 
always been most interested in. Oh, I guess I first

03:24.980 --> 03:30.340
had the chance to teach that about 12 years ago, and 
there has been more and more demand for it. The core

03:33.860 --> 03:37.880
curriculum allows some people, like in 
education, to take it as a quasi-requirement.

03:42.860 --> 03:44.780
That is, they have the choice. They have the choice 
of creative writing or some other things. And we

03:47.760 --> 03:51.780
just divided it into poetry and prose instead of 
just teaching it all together, and it really took

03:53.760 --> 03:56.780
off. Now, for instance, this semester I have 
exclusively creative writing classes. How many?

04:01.638 --> 04:02.780
Two. But two creative writing classes makes for a 
lot of work, because each ego is involved. It's

04:13.210 --> 04:16.230
teaching more to teach two creative writing 
classes, than it is to teach more students in a lit

04:16.210 --> 04:18.230
class, because lit students, you're not grating 
their souls. So my

04:23.210 --> 04:31.240
normal routine now is teaching creative writing 
and women's novels. And these are both

04:31.220 --> 04:35.240
upper-level undergraduate? No, they can be 
either lower level. For instance, one of my

04:38.220 --> 04:41.240
creative writing classes is 226, which is 
essentially a sophomore-level class. It will

04:43.220 --> 04:47.240
have freshmen in it, too, because they place out of 
the freshman class. About how many per session?

04:49.220 --> 04:50.550
Twenty-five. And then the, let's see, you 
mentioned another, other than creative writing,

04:54.660 --> 04:57.680
you mentioned another? Women's novels. Women's 
novels. I have either 45 or 35 in there, depending

04:59.660 --> 05:03.680
on which level it is. And that's upper level? 
That's upper level. It's either 374 or 474. In that

05:08.660 --> 05:13.680
course, what are your favorite novels that you 
urge them to read? Okay, we read Sylvia Plath's The

05:13.660 --> 05:16.680
Bell Jar. We read Maxine Hung Kingston's Woman 
Warrior. We read Toni Morrison's Beloved. Let's

05:22.660 --> 05:26.520
see, what else? We read Kate Chopin's The 
Awakening. Very often we start with Jane Eyre,

05:31.490 --> 05:36.980
because I always teach it the same way. I teach it as 
The Buildings Roman, which is the novel of

05:36.960 --> 05:41.980
development or education. And so I use only novels 
which show either coming of age or a learning

05:45.960 --> 05:47.980
experience of some other kind. Okay. Any other 
point in life? Mm-hmm. So often we use as our basic

05:51.606 --> 06:01.060
example that

05:51.606 --> 06:01.060
Jane Eyre, and then proceed through more 
contemporary ones up until the latest ones. And

06:07.510 --> 06:16.860
for you, you are now one of, how many women on the 
faculty in English? A lot. I would say that the

06:18.517 --> 06:20.920
faculty is about half male, half female. Mm-hmm. I 
don't know and are they are there some minority

06:22.045 --> 06:30.140
also yes we have quite a few now we have let's see 
we've got peaches Henry coming in she's she's on

06:30.120 --> 06:38.020
some sort of odd fellowship for this year but it was 
her first name peaches I thought you said peaches

06:41.780 --> 06:49.350
peaches Henry and we hired her away from Notre Dame 
we've got okay Kamla duty that's new she's a

06:49.330 --> 06:58.480
visiting assistant professor we have Kimberly 
Brown let's see now that's two of Kimberly Brown

06:58.460 --> 07:01.560
all these are african-americans

07:01.540 --> 07:12.660
can't remember his name we have four five if you 
count peaches I believe african-american

07:12.640 --> 07:19.480
faculty and then we have Marco Patel is I it kind of 
surprises me a little that we are not able to get and

07:19.460 --> 07:25.120
keep many Hispanics faculty we have had better 
luck with african-americans and I don't really

07:30.000 --> 07:33.120
understand that because here we are but I guess 
they don't want to come to College Station

07:33.100 --> 07:42.690
compare the students now and the students then 
okay now there are students I get students from all

07:42.670 --> 07:48.690
cultures at least I get about an equal balance of 
male and female students maybe even a few more

07:48.670 --> 07:52.350
women students because I teach poetry writing the 
fiction people get a few more men the

07:55.830 --> 08:07.600
students are less likely to do what I say they don't 
call me ma'am they're more likely to what what do

08:07.580 --> 08:12.800
they call you they call me Professor McCann or Dr. 
McCann okay I actually I'd like to encourage my

08:12.780 --> 08:18.550
graduate students to call me by my first name but 
they don't do it they they're more

08:18.530 --> 08:27.390
intellectually involved many of them they 
they're more intellectually involved many of

08:27.370 --> 08:31.960
them

08:35.660 --> 08:40.630
But I'm not teaching the same things. And if I were 
teaching freshmen now, I might find them a lot,

08:40.610 --> 08:46.810
that is, they would be multicultural and there 
would be a lot of women, but they too might think of

08:46.790 --> 08:51.230
the class as something to be got through as opposed 
to something that they're passionately

08:51.210 --> 08:55.770
interested in. People don't take creative 
writing unless they're interested. So I don't

08:58.050 --> 09:05.240
have sleeping students the way I used to, but they 
would be very polite when awakened back then. What

09:07.100 --> 09:10.350
are their career goals today? An

09:10.330 --> 09:18.630
awful lot of them want to teach. Some of them want to 
teach in high schools. My undergraduates, some of

09:20.630 --> 09:24.150
them want to teach in high schools, and I think 
that's great. We certainly need people teaching

09:24.130 --> 09:27.810
in high schools. Some of them want to teach in 
college. Of course, my graduate students, people

09:28.790 --> 09:34.050
who are getting a PhD in English all want to teach in 
college. I don't have, when

09:35.815 --> 09:44.140
I get the women's novels class. That is not for 
English majors necessarily. And I get a lot of

09:47.060 --> 09:53.520
people there, a lot of women who are going into 
business and industry. I don't, they're going to

09:53.500 --> 09:56.740
be personnel managers. I get a lot of psychology 
majors. I get mostly women in those classes too, I

09:59.220 --> 10:04.240
would say five to one, because it's rare that a man 
wants to sign up for all these women's

10:04.220 --> 10:12.860
coming-of-age novels, but I get a few.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.860
As far as you're aware, in terms of... Offices,

10:14.840 --> 10:25.660
salary, promotions, and so forth, have women been 
treated equitably in recent years in the

10:25.640 --> 10:32.180
department? Not really. As far as offices and so 
forth, yes. And I think Larry Mitchell makes a real

10:37.960 --> 10:42.900
effort at this. But

10:42.880 --> 10:51.450
especially in the recent past, there's been quite 
a bit of discrimination against women, I think.

10:52.430 --> 11:02.200
And it takes funny forms.

11:02.180 --> 11:13.020
There are a few women in high-profile positions, 
but I'm not sure they have real power.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.640
But I know that efforts are being made. Funny 
things happen. For instance, here's an example.

11:18.620 --> 11:23.020
There was some group that was supposed to study the 
situation, and the women's salaries are not as

11:23.000 --> 11:24.021
high as the men's. I mean, there's no question of 
that, if you look at the salaries for women, women

11:24.000 --> 11:29.900
full professors, for instance. Now, of course, 
there are various ways of looking at it. There are

11:33.340 --> 11:34.721
ways of looking at the information. If you look at 
them on a university-wide level, you get

11:34.700 --> 11:40.520
something like a $20,000 difference, at least. 
And then other people argue, well, the women are in

11:41.711 --> 11:45.020
liberal arts. But of course, part of this is 
because the women were not really welcomed in

11:45.000 --> 11:49.020
those other fields. And it's still harder for a 
woman to get tenure in some of these other fields. I

11:54.580 --> 11:58.820
mean, I look at what they did to Lynn Lamoureux. 
That was a case where she was promised all kinds of

11:58.800 --> 12:03.560
things when she came out here, and she got none of 
them. And then they didn't give her tenure. But of

12:07.390 --> 12:12.580
course, she got tenure, but she had to go through 
the legal system. She was originally, she's now in

12:12.560 --> 12:17.920
another department, because when they tenured 
her, when they were told by the law that they had to

12:17.900 --> 12:24.820
tenure her, or lose something major, they did, but 
they stuck her in another department. But I'm sure

12:27.280 --> 12:30.660
there's, if you want to look her up, her name is 
Lamoureux. Now, in English, what about French?

12:32.640 --> 12:33.252
French? French is the same as English? So, you are, 
as far as you know, about comparable salaries and

12:34.680 --> 12:37.280
promotions and so forth, men and women? I think 
they're about even in English. I don't see real

12:42.490 --> 12:43.771
discrepancy. And as far as you know, when there are 
recruitment opportunities that there is an

12:43.750 --> 12:51.050
effort to be balanced and fair? Oh, I don't think 
that, I don't think we even make that an issue

12:52.770 --> 12:59.370
anymore. That is, I really think that people are 
looked at.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.601
I don't think sex plays a role anymore. anymore. I 
think that we do have a balance. We may have more

13:10.273 --> 13:11.740
women than men. We brought in some women. We 
brought in Jen Swearengen, for instance, at a full

13:14.673 --> 13:19.110
professor level. I don't think that there's a 
problem with that. Who, who, a knowledgeable

13:23.780 --> 13:32.820
outsider would know, recognize most, who, which 
faculty in English would an outside, informed

13:32.800 --> 13:36.988
outsider know most about? Who are the high, the 
highest visibility faculty? Margaret Ezell.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.269
Ezell? Yes. In what area? She is in British 
literature, and everybody knows her. Outside of

13:51.216 --> 13:52.060
Margaret, let's see, there are a whole bunch of 
people that are pretty well known, like Larry

13:52.040 --> 13:58.150
Reynolds and, of course, Jerry Loving would go, I 
think, next to Margaret Ezell. Jerry Loving.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.590
What's his special? American Lit, and he's got a 
very well-reviewed

14:05.570 --> 14:13.690
book about Walt Whitman out, and I would say 
probably next to Margaret, the next person to be

14:13.670 --> 14:17.066
known would be Jerry. He's

14:18.353 --> 14:21.930
written several books on Whitman. This one, 
though, is popular as well as scholarly, and he's

14:23.416 --> 14:31.230
been on all the, he was interviewed all over the 
country by all of these major shows. Let's see, who

14:37.500 --> 14:39.050
else? Larry, after Margaret and Jerry, then there 
would be Larry. Bedford Clark is pretty well known

14:43.980 --> 14:46.307
as a Warren scholar.

14:49.016 --> 14:50.902
Robert Penn Warren, let's see, who else?

14:56.017 --> 14:56.860
Well, Jan Swearengin is known for her work in 
rhetoric. I would say those are the people. Do you

15:03.530 --> 15:06.981
have the impression that the department is making 
progress these days? Is it getting stronger,

15:08.030 --> 15:09.051
getting better? Yeah, I think it is, actually. I 
think it is. We've lost a bunch of faculty members,

15:12.710 --> 15:19.510
but we've also brought in some very new ones, and 
certainly in certain areas, we're making

15:19.490 --> 15:21.949
strides. We are now extremely multicultural, 
whereas six years ago, we were hardly

15:24.610 --> 15:28.310
multicultural at all. Who deserves credit for 
that? Larry Mitchell, I'd have to say. He is

15:32.425 --> 15:40.820
definitely a head, not a chair, but he has, and I've 
had a lot of differences with him, but he has, I

15:40.800 --> 15:45.320
think, I don't know, I don't know, done a lot to make 
the department multicultural, fairer to women,

15:45.300 --> 15:52.140
and so forth. About how many full-time 
tenure-track faculty are there now?

16:02.504 --> 16:02.884
Fifty? Sixty? Or between sixty and seventy, I'd 
say. Between sixty? Yeah, but that's easy enough

16:07.976 --> 16:11.558
information to get in the main office. I don't know 
it. And does the department ever get together? Yes

16:15.310 --> 16:16.940
and no. Not, it gets together. I'll tell you,

16:17.483 --> 16:21.547
I don't know. I don't know. I don't I don't know. I 
don't know. I don't know. But there is an annual

16:25.970 --> 16:29.310
party to welcome the graduate students, and I 
would say a third of the faculty attend. Larry

16:31.063 --> 16:33.703
Mitchell will have a party for the entire faculty. 
Two-thirds will attend that. But it doesn't get

16:37.784 --> 16:41.380
together because these things are huge, crowded 
parties, and you go and you grab your whatever and

16:41.360 --> 16:48.560
say hello to everybody and slither out the other 
door because it's just too crowded for real

16:48.540 --> 16:51.379
conversation. That is something that, It's just 
hard to do, to have real conversations at parties

16:54.460 --> 16:59.520
and really get together with your fellow faculty 
members. How do you and your faculty friends from

17:00.900 --> 17:07.400
whatever department, how do you get together? I 
would say that my

17:07.380 --> 17:17.400
faculty friends and I will have dinner together 
sometimes at one another's homes. I used to give

17:19.911 --> 17:24.150
parties, but I don't do it anymore, it seems too 
much hassle. And there's more work, that is one

17:24.130 --> 17:27.530
problem, there is more work, there are more 
meetings . People get so they just want to get a shot

17:29.987 --> 17:33.490
of all of this. They don't want to take it home. But 
when we do get together, we get together for

17:35.810 --> 17:39.030
dinner. All right, so you're saying that compared 
to 20, 30 years ago, you're working harder. Are the

17:45.750 --> 17:47.430
students working harder? No, they're working 
about the same amount. About the same. How would

17:53.520 --> 17:58.760
you compare the capability of the student's 
performance today? Who gets an A or a B with one who

17:58.740 --> 18:04.900
got an A or a B 20, 30 years ago? I would say that the 
gentleman's C is now the gentleman's B. B? Yeah.

18:10.100 --> 18:16.330
What I would like to see is the introduction of plus 
and minus grades so that you could still

18:16.310 --> 18:23.450
distinguish among A's and B's because most of us in 
upper level courses, not only throughout the

18:23.430 --> 18:27.650
College of Liberal Arts, but in other colleges 
too, most of the grades are A's and B's. So I would

18:28.670 --> 18:33.050
say that the student's A's and B's are not as high as 
they used to be. But you're saying that that A or B

18:33.030 --> 18:37.290
doesn't require as much work as it used to? I don't 
think it requires as high a level of competence,

18:37.270 --> 18:42.510
no, I don't. I think that students that I gave C's to 
30 years ago, many of them would now get B's. And as

18:51.030 --> 18:55.570
the students are entering today, are they better 
prepared from high school than they used to be? No.

18:57.926 --> 18:58.900
No, they're not. They're not, huh. Not certainly 
not in the area of writing skills, they could write

19:00.920 --> 19:07.730
better then.

19:07.710 --> 19:13.560
What major issues do you think A&M should be 
concerned about today? Okay, multiculturalism

19:13.540 --> 19:25.340
and fairness.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.341
I don't know. I know that we're working on it 
because we have a bunch of new faculty who are

19:26.320 --> 19:33.360
members of minority groups, so we're working on 
it. But I don't know. More

19:38.340 --> 19:45.710
needs to be done with the students with this 
because a lot of students don't have the message.

19:48.241 --> 19:54.690
And yet it can't be done in the form of, I don't 
think, I don't know how this new program is going to

19:54.670 --> 20:00.310
work where people have to take

19:54.670 --> 20:00.310
classes. I don't know if this is going to fix things 
up or not. But I do know something needs to be done

20:03.230 --> 20:14.470
because I see some basic racism around.

20:14.450 --> 20:17.470
In a way, too, I think we need to. Sometimes I think 
that some of the interest in cross-disciplinary

20:17.450 --> 20:25.450
work, multiculturalism and so forth, is more 
cosmetic than real. And I don't know how to make it

20:29.780 --> 20:35.390
more real, but I think it needs to be made more real. 
All

20:35.370 --> 20:39.194
right. Other? For instance, if you'll turn it off, 
I'll give you a second. All right. Now we're

20:45.652 --> 20:51.420
talking about things that can be done today and 
some goals that A&M should undertake.

21:03.427 --> 21:09.420
I'm trying to think of other things besides 
multiculturalism. There are a lot of initiatives

21:09.400 --> 21:14.520
that are being taken that, for instance, there's a 
lot of movement toward cross-disciplinary work

21:14.500 --> 21:22.320
and collaboration.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.880
I think we need to become more international and 
we're doing that. Now what do you mean by

21:25.860 --> 21:29.960
international? I think I know, but I want to be 
sure. I mean. I mean, I mean. I mean, one of the

21:33.740 --> 21:34.791
things that's odd. I don't

21:34.770 --> 22:00.040
know what some of the things that

21:34.770 --> 22:00.040
we're

21:34.770 --> 22:00.040
doing, like the great options that we've had. Oh, I 
think there are a lot of good options. There are. I

22:03.380 --> 22:06.530
think it should be required that everybody learn a 
second language. If I could be the emperor, I would

22:07.250 --> 22:11.610
make that a baccalaureate degree requirement. 
Yeah. For the modern world. And in fact, though, I

22:17.160 --> 22:21.880
think that we are taking steps in this direction, 
but I think that, yes, we need to encourage

22:21.860 --> 22:29.360
everyone to become more aware of other cultures 
and to learn about them. I remember reading that

22:30.840 --> 22:35.300
report where somebody said something to the 
effect that they couldn't send Aggies to New York,

22:35.280 --> 22:39.000
let alone to Japan, or something like that. We need 
to make it so that Aggies can go anywhere and know

22:39.060 --> 22:42.560
how to behave. Is there any school or program you 
can think of that we might use as a model? Is there

22:48.580 --> 22:50.260
any institution that is? I think we have to make up 
our own direction for this because there are a lot

22:55.580 --> 22:57.960
of different things that work, but they have to do 
with particular institutions. I don't think that

23:01.860 --> 23:04.920
we could adopt somebody else's program. What 
should the department's goals be? The English

23:08.260 --> 23:09.741
department's goals? Okay. I think we should 
strengthen our master's program and introduce

23:13.220 --> 23:19.870
an attractive professional writing program. We 
should be willing to provide, help teachers in the

23:20.850 --> 23:30.510
high school get masters in English because I think 
that we've got a situation kind of where the tail's

23:30.490 --> 23:35.510
wagging, with the Texas Education Association. 
They're dictating to us what we should be

23:37.990 --> 23:40.510
teaching, and they're not having the right, they 
don't have the right emphases. I think we need to

23:45.510 --> 23:47.310
work on that.

23:50.350 --> 23:53.250
I think we need to strengthen linguistics. I think 
we need to strengthen creative writing. I always

23:57.770 --> 24:01.290
thought that creative writing was a wonderful 
possibility for bringing in multicultural

24:01.270 --> 24:04.090
people, but we've never done it. We did have 
Gordon, and we kind of, we inherited him from

24:07.950 --> 24:09.970
theater arts. He didn't come to us originally, I 
don't believe, I'm not sure, but he was very

24:14.370 --> 24:18.300
definitely an asset while we had him. And we could, 
for instance, since he died, there's been nobody

24:25.060 --> 24:27.000
to teach playwriting. We have this whole, we don't 
have a program in creative writing, but we do have a

24:31.020 --> 24:33.700
track, and it's got a missing stare. So this would 
be a wonderful opportunity to bring in a Hispanic

24:34.860 --> 24:38.700
or black playwright but this won't happen, 
because our emphasis is very much on literary

24:38.680 --> 24:46.440
scholarship of a particular sort, essentially 
theory. And I think we need to, everybody else in

24:49.920 --> 24:56.200
the department will tell you differently, but I 
think that we should focus less on theory and more

24:56.180 --> 25:00.040
on these other areas so that we are a strong 
department across the board. We don't just have

25:03.180 --> 25:06.500
strong theory contingent. Your personal goals. 
My personal goals. Well,

25:11.340 --> 25:17.400
for my scholarship, you mean, or? For your 
professional. For my professional development,

25:20.500 --> 25:22.520
okay. Well,

25:22.500 --> 25:26.340
I do anthologies. I've done two of them with 
someone else, and I'm working on a third one

25:26.320 --> 25:30.340
myself. I'd like to put together a really good 
anthology of poetry. I also have my own poetry

25:38.640 --> 25:40.660
collections. I'd like to get one of these 
published by a well-known press. Because so far

25:48.640 --> 25:55.830
I've only been able to interest small press in my 
work. I have a kind of strange project that is a book

25:55.810 --> 26:01.830
of poetry based on letters. I have a collection of 
letters. I collect old letters. And this is a

26:04.810 --> 26:10.100
collection of letters written by members

26:04.810 --> 26:10.100
of, by the two halves of a courting couple in 1830. 
And they get married. And then they become family

26:17.300 --> 26:20.320
letters. Somebody kept these letters that start 
actually in 1828 and end in 1863, I think is the last

26:23.300 --> 26:27.320
one. And I've done poems that are dramatic 
monologues based on these letters. And I'm also

26:32.300 --> 26:37.380
trying to fill some history in. Some of the groups 
that they refer to, some of the journals and so

26:40.360 --> 26:42.380
forth. I'm trying to find out more information 
about these to put little historical bridges in.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.380
And I want to get somebody interested in printing 
this. It's fascinating. The way you can see into

26:51.694 --> 26:54.430
this couple from this perspective. And how they 
lived because they wrote meticulously detailed

26:59.560 --> 27:03.580
letters of how they lived, what they had for lunch. 
He was a schoolteacher who later became a Baptist

27:06.560 --> 27:11.580
minister, I believe. After the sequence of 
letters was finished. And

27:14.750 --> 27:21.980
most of the letters are actually from the courting 
period. And it's just interesting to see what

27:21.960 --> 27:24.980
courtship between very religious people was like 
at that time. Of course I've got a lot of other

27:28.960 --> 27:32.980
letters from that time in my collection. And 
religion, Christianity was very definitely

27:36.960 --> 27:40.980
woven into the fabric of lives the way it is not now. 
All decisions were referred to Providence. And

27:43.960 --> 27:46.980
biblical introduction.

28:30.900 --> 28:30.960
And and

28:30.940 --> 28:41.340
and and and and written written

28:46.120 --> 28:54.860
written Somebody

28:54.840 --> 29:08.580
who is interested in multiculturalism and new 
directions of thought, but he should not be like I

28:54.840 --> 29:08.580
was over here with you. He

29:08.560 --> 29:20.100
should be somebody who is going to be fair to all 
departments and not just the departments that he

29:08.560 --> 29:20.100
comes from. He should be

29:20.080 --> 29:32.570
somebody who is familiar with interdisciplinary 
work in the direction of studying law. He or

29:32.550 --> 29:50.560
she, and I'd

29:32.550 --> 29:50.560
like to say she of course, should be somebody who is 
interested in looking at how women are treated in

29:32.550 --> 29:50.560
the colleges. I don't know. My department, as I 
said, I don't see anything as fair. However, I know

29:55.540 --> 29:59.560
people who have been treated very fairly in other 
departments. So

29:59.540 --> 30:10.730
he should be able to kind of reset these switches in 
those departments. From

30:10.710 --> 30:15.380
what kind of institution should he be reset? I 
would say in a large space.

30:21.219 --> 30:27.760
He wouldn't do well with somebody who had to deal 
with only small numbers of things. Right

30:27.740 --> 30:38.890
now, you're advising the provost. I don't even 
know what the provost does. He's there. What does

30:42.635 --> 30:43.040
he do? If you tell me what he does, maybe I can make 
some suggestions. What about the president?

30:49.020 --> 30:52.040
Again, I don't know what their functions are. What 
direction should the president lead this? I think

30:56.610 --> 31:08.540
in the direction of increasing the number of 
faculty all across the board, of reducing the

31:08.520 --> 31:13.540
number of large, this is done, I know, for 
financial reasons. They have these huge courses.

31:15.520 --> 31:18.540
I think these should be reduced to very few 
courses. I think those should be only the most

31:18.520 --> 31:23.980
basic courses.
