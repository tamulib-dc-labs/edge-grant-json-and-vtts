00:02.731 --> 00:23.497
First of all, Mr. Heller, tell us something about 
your early life, including the names of your

00:02.731 --> 00:23.497
parents, the dates and places of their birth and 
death, the date and place of your birth, and the

00:02.731 --> 00:23.497
schools you attended before you entered Texas 
A&M.

00:23.517 --> 00:29.785
Well, my father's name was Louis F. Heller.

00:32.212 --> 00:39.883
I don't remember his date, but he was 49 years old 
when he died in 1940.

00:42.286 --> 00:45.591
My mother's name was Annie Ann Haller.

00:49.817 --> 00:54.263
She was 70 years old when she died in 1940. I

00:54.283 --> 01:01.273
lived in Victoria and tended St. Joseph's school, 
a Catholic school, before I went to A&M.

01:12.623 --> 01:13.024
I don't know. Do you remember where your mother and 
father were born? My father was born in Victoria,

01:15.346 --> 01:23.753
Texas, and my mother in St. Louis, Missouri. And 
she would have moved to Victoria? Yeah, they come

01:29.499 --> 01:30.940
in there. grandfather was a brewer and he put up a 
brewery down there in Victoria, Texas and was in

01:31.443 --> 01:53.855
business there up until the time they began to ship 
ice in there over the railroads and then that cut

01:31.443 --> 01:53.855
his business out because they wanted ice beer 
instead of new home beer. What kind of business was

01:53.875 --> 01:55.477
your father in? He was in the dry goods business.

02:03.235 --> 02:12.355
Had that drag of the business for some time in 1895

02:03.235 --> 02:12.355
or 6, I think.

02:18.729 --> 02:20.232
I just had that recently, but.

02:35.585 --> 02:40.372
He and his brother started the business in 1891. 
But the brother went to Yoakum to open up a store.

02:47.283 --> 02:50.307
And Lewis Halley, he kept the store in Victoria. 
And he was there up until 1949 when he died of a heart

02:50.868 --> 02:56.436
attack. Mother had the store then for

02:58.580 --> 03:04.849
three or four years. then sold it to the brother. He 
came back to Victoria. At that time, he had sold his

03:11.724 --> 03:20.734
store before and he didn't have any

03:11.724 --> 03:20.734
occupation. Uh-huh. And then, so, you were born in 
Victoria. I was born in Victoria. And what was the

03:27.822 --> 03:29.083
date of your birth? April the 10th, 1895. Okay. I'm 
not sure that I caught the age of your father at his

03:35.035 --> 03:39.642
death. He was 49. 49. And he died when? In 1919. 
1919. Oh, OK. I seemed to think that you had said

03:51.599 --> 03:55.465
1940 earlier. Well, mother died. Your mother died 
in 1940. Well, I was married only two weeks before

03:58.209 --> 04:02.135
the father died. Uh-huh. What factors were 
involved in your choice of Texas A&M? Why did you

04:08.273 --> 04:09.434
decide to go there? Well, before they had some 
land, had some farmland, and I wanted to go there to

04:11.036 --> 04:25.095
learn how to farm.

04:25.115 --> 04:28.300
I wasn't interested into being a businessman. I 
wanted to go outdoors. And where was this land? It

04:32.933 --> 04:34.755
was in Victoria County. Victoria County. What 
procedures did you go through to enter Texas A&M?

04:41.801 --> 04:43.723
Well, I didn't have any particular. I entered it on 
a special permission from the president. Had you

04:53.752 --> 04:55.854
finished Victoria High School? No. No. I didn't 
finish any high school. So you had to have special

04:58.677 --> 05:01.900
permission to enter at age 16? Yeah. And what were 
your reactions to the school when you first

05:04.017 --> 05:10.086
arrived? Did you know enough about it to know what 
to expect? No, I didn't know a thing about it. You

05:15.113 --> 05:18.578
just knew that there was a Texas A&M and wanted to go 
there? Texas A&M, yeah. I don't think anybody ever

05:19.479 --> 05:23.645
said anything to me about it before. Oh, I had a 
brother there that was there a year, a year ahead of

05:23.865 --> 05:27.290
me. Yeah. So you were... He could have told you then 
a little bit about the problems the freshmen

05:32.384 --> 05:38.874
encountered when they got there. Yeah, I guess he 
did tell me about it.

05:46.225 --> 05:47.086
I was lucky, though. I didn't get hazed too much. I 
got one whip in one time with these triangle

05:50.151 --> 05:54.497
rulers. It got a groove in it, you know, and they 
sting. They sting, yeah.

06:03.940 --> 06:06.903
I'm assuming you arrived there by train. Did you 
arrive during the day or during the night?

06:15.914 --> 06:19.618
Father took me up there, but I don't know how we got 
there. Whether we had to go to Bryan, stop at a hotel

06:19.638 --> 06:25.725
there, and then come out on that trolley. Probably 
did that, but I don't remember. Okay.

06:33.978 --> 06:39.725
Did you have any choice in the military company to 
which you were assigned the first year?

06:43.930 --> 06:45.091
I don't think I was. I think they just put me where 
they wanted me. Where they had place, huh? They put

06:49.496 --> 06:59.648
me in Company C when I first went up there and then I 
went to Company B and stayed in Company B I guess

06:49.496 --> 06:59.648
about three years. And where were you housed in 
Company C? Company C was housed in Foster. So that

07:06.750 --> 07:08.492
was one of the older dormitories. I presume you had 
the pleasure of holding wood and water for the

07:08.612 --> 07:13.518
upperclassmen? Yeah, wood and water. And the 
other one was in Goodwin Hall. We had a little

07:19.344 --> 07:21.487
better accommodations there. Yeah, that one was a 
fairly new one at that time, wasn't it? Goodwin is

07:26.212 --> 07:28.234
now used as a classroom building. It is? Yeah. I 
don't know exactly when it was converted to

07:29.744 --> 07:34.248
classroom, but quite a long while back, I believe.

07:38.653 --> 07:41.936
Would you describe a typical day while you were 
there? Sort of tell us what you did during a whole

07:44.478 --> 07:56.770
day, when you got up and what you did the first thing 
and when you went to class and what you did in the

07:44.478 --> 07:56.770
afternoon, if you can remember. And when you went 
to bed?

08:02.644 --> 08:05.968
No, I pretty well followed the schedule.

08:11.296 --> 08:11.776
I don't know. Do you remember what the schedule 
was? I sure don't.

08:21.387 --> 08:26.453
Can you tell us a little bit about life in the 
dormitories, particularly in Foster Hall? What

08:26.533 --> 08:28.616
sort of things did you have to do?

08:32.821 --> 08:34.142
Did I see Foster Hall? Yeah, I believe so. Yeah.

08:40.410 --> 08:41.511
It wasn't Foster Hall. There was another one down 
there. Was it Prez Ross?

08:47.759 --> 08:49.521
I had it on my mind a while ago, but I... Well, in 
Goodwin Hall,

08:51.087 --> 09:09.430
we often would come into our room and find a push the 
door open and get hit with a pan or a bucket of water.

09:09.450 --> 09:12.994
And that's about the only The day I got there, of 
course, I wasn't a freshman then, but those pranks

09:13.666 --> 09:21.099
would go on anyhow. You mentioned earlier that you 
had a brother who went there the year before you

09:22.581 --> 09:26.147
did. Did he go back the second year? Yeah, they had a 
two-year course at that time, and he finished his

09:28.311 --> 09:34.662
two-year course. Yes, but I went on to finish the 
four-year course. Did you by any chance room with

09:38.168 --> 09:40.772
him the first year you were there? Yes, I roomed 
with him. So you had a sophomore as your roommate

09:42.434 --> 09:47.420
the first year. Was there a little bit of an 
advantage to having that? I believe it was. You had

09:52.005 --> 09:53.367
a little bit of protection. However, he didn't get 
me out at one time.

09:58.834 --> 10:04.581
I suppose it would have been a little bit of an 
advantage to have a sophomore older brother on

10:04.848 --> 10:06.990
your side, at least part of the time.

10:10.693 --> 10:15.878
Back to the dormitories, I believe the old ones 
were Foster, Ross, Austin, and Pfeiffer.

10:16.259 --> 10:17.119
Pfeiffer's the one. Pfeiffer's the one. Okay.

10:23.525 --> 10:30.592
Did they have inside showers and inside latrines? 
No, when we were in Pfeiffer, we had to go about two

10:34.649 --> 10:42.542
or three blocks to an auditorium down there with 
one separate building with showers. And when you

10:43.904 --> 10:48.672
walked in there, that sulfur smell was awful. Do 
they still have that up there now? Well, they all

10:50.415 --> 10:55.744
have showers in all the dormitories, and I don't 
notice a sulfur smell to the water. Well, when you

10:56.585 --> 11:00.792
used to walk in that place, there's an awful smell 
of sulfur. Walk down there and take your shower,

11:01.396 --> 11:06.124
and then walk about a block or so back to your dorm. 
What about a latrine? Did you have those in the

11:07.686 --> 11:10.831
building, or were they in a separate building too? 
Yeah, they were there. I think they were in . I don't

11:17.201 --> 11:18.323
remember when it was. There was a time somewhere 
about the turn of the century where they had a brick

11:18.383 --> 11:27.538
out building, which they called the sink. That was 
the only, well, maybe I shouldn't say the only

11:27.856 --> 11:34.425
toilet, but that's what it was. It was a rather 
small brick building with a real tall chimney that

11:34.445 --> 11:39.072
they called the sink.

11:42.877 --> 11:51.349
But in the new dormitory, Goodman, you had showers 
and toilets. toilets on every floor, I think. They

11:54.132 --> 11:56.715
had one tub, I think, on each floor, too. One tub 
there.

12:02.404 --> 12:05.749
What about the food in the mess hall? I believe you 
had two different mess halls while you were there,

12:05.769 --> 12:08.213
didn't you? The old one burned one year. Yeah, the 
first one burned on the eleventh day of the

12:09.535 --> 12:17.607
eleventh month of the eleventh year. So that would 
have been your first year there, wouldn't it?

12:19.875 --> 12:21.897
Yeah, the first year I hadn't been there very long. 
And

12:23.860 --> 12:30.528
I don't remember getting into that new one at all. I 
guess I did in about 1915. Yeah, I believe they had

12:34.413 --> 12:40.221
it in about 12 or 13, but you had a temporary. Well, 
that one burned down, and then they built a

12:41.582 --> 12:46.108
temporary one after that. out of galvanized iron. 
And the night after a dance, White caught a fire and

12:49.769 --> 12:54.935
burned up. And I think they sent us home for several 
weeks right around the Christmas time.

13:04.126 --> 13:10.173
So we had to eat with the mess kits.

13:10.193 --> 13:12.055
But that was the year of the fires, too. There was 
more fires there in 11 and 12. And any year that I

13:17.341 --> 13:20.084
know of, I believe they'd have. They had that mess 
hall, I think the main building burned. The main

13:24.308 --> 13:25.949
building burned in 12 sometime. And then there's a 
tent, there's a tent row out there. The tents

13:30.093 --> 13:34.798
caught a fire, and then the steam plant had a fire 
down there. They must have had 10 or 12 fires in that

13:36.480 --> 13:38.862
one year. All in that one between September and 
May. Did

13:41.104 --> 13:47.010
you know any of the people who lived in the tents?

13:49.960 --> 14:02.795
Yeah, boys that

13:49.960 --> 14:02.795
used to run around with, but I can't, I think one 
name was Colin, but he's been dead many years. I

14:04.077 --> 14:08.402
imagine the life in the tent was a little bit 
different than that in the dormitory, wasn't it?

14:09.183 --> 14:11.506
Oh, it must have been. Particularly when it got 
cold. Oh, yeah. They had stoves in them, though, I

14:15.070 --> 14:17.193
believe, didn't they? Well, they had some kind of a 
stove, but I don't remember.

14:24.264 --> 14:30.573
Yeah, come rainy weather, too, there was no 
pavement there, and that ground would get wet, and

14:24.264 --> 14:30.573
it would be nasty. What about the ground between 
the other buildings? Was there any kind of

14:33.677 --> 14:35.040
walkways? I'm sure you didn't have concrete 
sidewalks like we have today, but... Did you have

14:41.665 --> 14:45.129
any gravel walks or anything like that to keep them 
getting in the mud so much?

14:48.173 --> 15:00.969
I don't know just what they

14:48.173 --> 15:00.969
did.

15:01.009 --> 15:10.120
Can you tell me about any privileges that the 
upperclassmen, that is the sophomores, juniors,

15:01.009 --> 15:10.120
and seniors, might have had that the freshmen 
didn't have?

15:15.567 --> 15:19.353
What sort of things could they do that, as a 
freshman, you couldn't do?

15:24.061 --> 15:27.165
I don't know as about that, but I did. There's two 
trains come in there, the INGN and Southern

15:27.386 --> 15:34.998
Pacific. Well, I could take one train and go to 
Navasota and see a girl. and catch the other train

15:42.955 --> 15:46.419
and come back and get back by midnight. So they 
probably had hours that you could stay out on. But

15:53.148 --> 16:06.945
that would have been after your freshman year, I 
think, if you could do that.

16:07.345 --> 16:11.410
What kind of things did you do for recreation or 
entertainment? Well, I walked out quite a bit on

16:13.313 --> 16:20.381
the days off, took Kodak pictures. Did you keep 
those Kodak pictures? Yeah, I got them, but I can't

16:23.044 --> 16:26.408
find them. I mean, did you take pictures of the 
campus or the... Well, there's a campus from the

16:26.428 --> 16:43.287
surrounding country and we would take long hikes 
and go to the little old store out there on, I don't

16:26.428 --> 16:43.287
know which direction it is, I'd get mixed up in the 
directions. of there because east is west and so

16:43.790 --> 16:46.914
forth. So I went out to the little old store and

16:47.275 --> 17:03.355
had a bunch of carnation, dime brand carnation 
milk and ginger crackers and almost got sick on

16:47.275 --> 17:03.355
eating that. And there was a Bohemians had a hall 
just pretty close to the campus there and they used

17:03.375 --> 17:10.725
to have parties. And we used to go over there, and 
the boys would bring home some of that sausage, you

17:10.942 --> 17:19.114
know, and stick it under the nose of some of the boys 
in the dormitory. It was a strong-smelling

17:19.574 --> 17:24.661
sausage. Uh-huh. Was that some of the boys that 
didn't like the sausage? They were kind of

17:27.045 --> 17:30.129
bedeviling with the smell, huh? Yeah. Did the 
student body or the Corps of Cadets, as they were

17:31.276 --> 17:46.457
when you were there, take a long hike down to the 
brasses for a night or two while you were there?

17:50.663 --> 17:55.630
I don't think we did, but we used to go at night and go 
coon hunting. go coon hunting. They had a neighbor

17:57.514 --> 18:01.599
on there that had some dogs and he'd go coon 
hunting. Uh-huh. You mean just go off the campus

18:02.059 --> 18:04.382
someplace to go coon hunting? Yeah, go coon 
hunting. The Corps used to go to Dallas to the fair.

18:11.470 --> 18:18.498
Then we'd take our uniforms and our guns and we'd do 
some parading there at the Dallas County Fair.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.883
But that's the only time that I know that we went in a 
group.

18:26.508 --> 18:26.848
Okay. Did you have any favorite instructors?

18:34.096 --> 18:53.455
Well,

18:34.096 --> 18:53.455
Thornton was an instructor, and he is the one that 
taught me into four years of finishing my course,

18:34.096 --> 18:53.455
four years. And Bill Singh. The entomology, I kind 
of liked him, and I was interested in entomology,

18:56.056 --> 19:10.591
although my major is supposed to be agronomy.

19:10.611 --> 19:13.494
Yeah, this is, the Thornton, is that Duke 
Thornton? I believe that's what they called him.

19:16.737 --> 19:18.179
He was in chemistry? I don't know what he was. Or 
chemical engineering? I guess he was. He's still

19:24.784 --> 19:25.445
living? Yes. My assistant interviewed him a 
couple weeks ago in this same program. The most

19:32.557 --> 19:35.942
distinguished professor there was old Botany 
Ball. O.M. Ball? O.M. Ball. Did you have courses

19:39.908 --> 19:41.050
under him? Yeah. How about Dr. Francis in vet 
medicine? Oh yeah, Dr. Francis, he was a I always

19:48.470 --> 19:56.343
enjoyed going to his class because it turned out to 
be a show. What sort of things did he do? I don't

19:58.847 --> 19:59.367
know. He'd say something that would get the class 
tickled. He kept his class, I think, a pretty good

20:05.657 --> 20:08.542
mule.

20:11.727 --> 20:12.368
What... attitude or opinion did the students have 
toward the administration? That would be both to

20:18.500 --> 20:23.707
the president and to the commandant. I believe you 
had two different presidents while you were

20:23.727 --> 20:26.551
there, didn't you? Yeah, I had Catfish... Milner? 
Catfish Milner.

20:35.663 --> 20:38.146
And Bissell, I think, wasn't it? Yeah, Bissell.

20:41.691 --> 20:42.051
Well... It seemed to me like everything was going 
fine. However, we did get out on a strike. And I

20:51.142 --> 20:58.911
think there's some, they had company football 
teams. And the boys on, I think it was Company D, got

20:58.931 --> 21:08.002
thrown off the team, several of them did. I don't 
know why. But there's 466 of us struck and went

21:11.174 --> 21:15.620
home. Some of the boys, when they got home, why, 
their father sent them right back. But my father

21:21.869 --> 21:28.359
let me stay home several weeks, and he finally said 
either go to school or go to work. So we went back up.

21:31.363 --> 21:41.097
When we got to college, we had to humiliate 
ourselves and sign a pledge not to strike.

21:41.785 --> 21:46.851
I've heard a couple of people refer to Mr. Milner as 
Catfish Milner. Do you have any idea where he got

21:46.871 --> 21:48.914
that nickname? I believe it's the shape of his 
mouth. I'm not sure. I'm not sure, but I think it's

21:54.500 --> 21:56.703
the shape of his mouth.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.792
What about Dr. Bazell? Did the students have 
any... Now, back to the strike a minute. Was

22:08.437 --> 22:09.919
that... Strike, was Mr.

22:10.237 --> 22:17.133
Milner involved in that strike at all? I don't 
think so. I don't know what it brought about. At

22:21.744 --> 22:24.010
that time, we were following the crowd. Uh-huh. 
But a whole bunch of you. Yeah. I don't know how many

22:27.935 --> 22:33.302
students were at that place at that time, but it 
seems to me something like about 750. It may have

22:33.543 --> 22:35.265
been more than that. But a whole bunch of you took 
off and went home. Yeah, it was 400 and I think it's

22:37.828 --> 22:40.151
466. Mm-hmm. And then some of them came right back, 
and some of them came back after a while. Yeah,

22:45.798 --> 22:48.041
Father, Son, and back, and they finally drove 
back. Probably some of them never did come back.

22:50.144 --> 22:50.284
Mm-hmm. I went back. Did you have to make up for lost 
time when you came back? I mean, you missed several

22:57.426 --> 22:58.528
weeks. No, we didn't make it. Of course, we had to 
pass our tests as they come. So you didn't have to

23:04.276 --> 23:06.418
make up all the work that you missed. No, I didn't 
have to put in any extra.

23:11.465 --> 23:12.667
What about to the commandant? Did you have any 
run-in with him? Do you remember who the

23:16.672 --> 23:19.136
commandant was? No, I never had any. Never had any 
trouble in the military line at all. Do you

23:26.048 --> 23:27.550
remember who the commandant was? I don't know. I 
got a yearbook there. I probably would tell you.

23:31.495 --> 23:33.497
Oh, OK. Well, I'm sorry. I was just wondering if you 
remembered right offhand what his name was and if

23:34.618 --> 23:40.545
you had any thoughts about him.

23:44.290 --> 23:49.596
We know that a lot of the students had some type of 
employment while they were at school. Did you ever

23:49.796 --> 23:51.979
have a part-time job while you were there? Well, 
the first money I ever really earned in my life was

23:53.866 --> 24:00.295
counting tags to go on feed bags. But that didn't 
last long. That was only for a few days.

24:07.726 --> 24:08.687
You did that at school? There was one fellow that 
used to come around with a bucket with candy and go

24:08.907 --> 24:16.498
around selling candy. And I

24:17.359 --> 24:22.827
don't know of any other ones that That worked at 
all. There may have been some working in the mess

24:24.464 --> 24:28.870
hall. But I don't know of anybody else. Did the 
students who played football and basketball,

24:33.216 --> 24:44.593
well you didn't have basketball then, but 
football and baseball for the college team have

24:33.216 --> 24:44.593
any special privileges?

24:47.077 --> 24:47.537
I don't know. They have a separate table for them to 
eat at?

24:59.577 --> 25:00.318
Let's see. I did go through your senior yearbook, 
and there was an indication there that you

25:01.439 --> 25:12.073
belonged to a number of organizations. And I'd 
like to ask you about those, if you remember what

25:12.813 --> 25:16.438
they were. One of them was the Foundry Toter Club.

25:25.769 --> 25:26.190
I don't know. I belonged to a Newman Club there. 
Yeah, that was, I believe, the Catholic Boys Club.

25:36.136 --> 25:38.160
I don't know of any special thing we did. We would 
have to go to Bryan to go to Mass on Sundays at that

25:38.200 --> 25:45.434
time. Was the whole Corps of Cadets marched to the 
chapel for services on Sunday?

25:57.138 --> 26:07.757
There was a period when I know that they were all 
marched to the chapel, or was in the assembly hall,

25:57.138 --> 26:07.757
sometimes called the assembly hall, and then the 
chapel. I don't remember anything about that. But

26:12.566 --> 26:19.718
anyway, the Catholic boys went to Bryan, to the 
church. Went to Bryan. There was an organization

26:23.159 --> 26:26.483
called the 466 Club. Do you remember anything 
about that? That's the strike. Okay. That's the

26:30.708 --> 26:31.709
strike bunch. That's the strike, huh? So it was 
what, 466 of you? It was 466 of us. Well, a strike.

26:40.079 --> 26:41.902
What about the Veterans of the Lost Cause? Well, 
that was an organization where you dress up in

26:43.724 --> 26:49.671
tacky clothes. Mm-hmm. And some ridiculous goes, 
I got a picture in there of me.

26:59.854 --> 27:01.757
So you just did that on one day? Yeah, I think it was 
just one day. It only was. I was wondering whether

27:04.982 --> 27:09.228
that might have had something to do with the 
strike, too, whether that was the fellows who came

27:04.982 --> 27:09.228
back. No. No, I think that was an annual event. We 
were all privates, I think. Well, let's see.

27:21.665 --> 27:23.027
Would that have been junior privates? Would that 
have been privates who were juniors? According to

27:27.976 --> 27:33.244
the yearbook, you were veterans of the lost cause 
in 13 and 14, which would have been your junior

27:27.976 --> 27:33.244
year. Well, I guess it belongs to those that have 
been privates all their lives. There was no

27:38.013 --> 27:42.380
corporals, no sergeants, no officers, nothing. 
That was the lost cause.

27:46.268 --> 27:50.612
And then according to that, you stayed as a private 
all four years. Yeah, I stayed a private all four

27:50.652 --> 27:53.455
years. I gather you didn't... I had the honor of 
being officer of the day several times, but I was

27:54.777 --> 28:01.223
still a private. You were still a private.

28:05.107 --> 28:05.468
And... But, okay.

28:14.897 --> 28:15.718
When you... Graduated then in the spring of 1915. 
Did you have a job lined up for you, or what did you

28:21.543 --> 28:26.089
do? Well, the father had this farm, and I went on to 
it.

28:37.623 --> 28:41.467
And so you did general farming there for a while, 
huh? Yeah, started the farm. What kind of crop did

28:42.789 --> 28:46.313
you raise? mostly cotton at that time. And for how 
long did you do that? Well, I did that

28:54.229 --> 29:04.866
I guess there for about three years, and then he 
bought another farm. I had two farms then, and I

29:05.326 --> 29:11.015
went to the second farm, which was a diversified 
farm. It had cattle, timber, and seven different

29:14.069 --> 29:15.951
grades of land. Where was that, Luke? It's in 
Victoria County, but it was about 15 miles apart.

29:25.679 --> 29:28.061
Did you participate in the First World War at all? 
First World War? Yeah, I was in the First World War.

29:32.805 --> 29:33.746
In what capacity? I stayed as a special duty at 
Travis. writing service records, data and

29:43.347 --> 29:48.252
service records. Then after the war ended, they 
transferred me over to Kelly Field and I was in the

29:49.293 --> 29:59.263
Quartermaster at Kelly Field. And so you say that 
was after the war ended? Yeah. And then you stayed

30:03.848 --> 30:06.050
in the Army for a little while then? No, I was 
discharged on January 26, 19,

30:14.583 --> 30:18.850
19, from the, from Kelly Field. From Kelly Field, 
and where did you go after that? Well, I married on

30:23.678 --> 30:38.262
March the 3rd, 1919, and I stayed on these, on these 
farms until we got
