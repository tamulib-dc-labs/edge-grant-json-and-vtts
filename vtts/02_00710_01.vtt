00:03.018 --> 00:08.105
I'm interviewing Dr. Donald McDonald, head of the 
Department of Civil Engineering. Today's date is

00:09.307 --> 00:12.792
July 22, 1981. Dr. McDonald, would you please tell 
us something about your boyhood years in

00:12.812 --> 00:23.146
Montgomery, Alabama?

00:23.166 --> 00:29.295
I grew up in Montgomery until I went to college. 
except for about three years that we lived in South

00:30.187 --> 00:36.355
Georgia in a couple of small towns there.

00:39.700 --> 00:47.010
My father was in the cottonseed oil business, and 
he was transferred to Georgia, and then we moved

00:39.700 --> 00:47.010
back later on. I went to the public schools there, 
mostly in Montgomery. During the war, my father

00:58.305 --> 00:59.907
was... I worked for a construction firm at Oak 
Ridge, and so he was away quite a good bit, and then

01:00.983 --> 01:11.055
moved back to Montgomery after the war was over. I 
continued there, living there until I graduated

01:12.797 --> 01:20.506
from high school, and then went to Auburn. When did 
you graduate from high school? In 1948. Went on to

01:26.493 --> 01:30.838
Auburn and took civil engineering there. 
graduated in May 1952 with a Bachelor of Civil

01:31.831 --> 01:36.658
Engineering degree. How did you develop an 
interest in engineering? It was most probably,

01:43.046 --> 01:45.870
there were several reasons. One is Auburn was a 
real strong engineering school and I had no real

01:46.031 --> 02:01.652
driving urge to be an engineer but I knew that was a 
good field and so I thought I would, I was

01:46.031 --> 02:01.652
considering that for quite a number of years but I 
had summertime jobs working with the city, the

02:02.932 --> 02:11.783
city engineer in Montgomery, and was assigned to a 
surveying crew. And over a period of several

02:11.823 --> 02:26.181
summers, I worked in various positions on a 
surveying crew, starting as a rodman and a

02:11.823 --> 02:26.181
chainman and instrument man and those things. And 
so I became very familiar with surveying. And like

02:30.085 --> 02:31.487
so many people, I thought that that was what civil 
engineering was, and it was kind of fun. I enjoyed

02:37.825 --> 02:38.345
it. Of course, I found out that civil engineering 
is a lot broader than that as I got into it, but I

02:39.827 --> 02:46.936
don't regret that. It's just that I got in sort of 
the back door. I think a lot of people do that.

02:54.326 --> 02:56.889
How was your family affected by the Depression? Do 
you remember anything about that? I don't have all

03:00.233 --> 03:01.575
that. depression baggage hanging over me. I was 
born in 1930. And of course, we went into the

03:05.954 --> 03:12.921
Depression or were just going into the Depression 
right then. But I always remember we had a house and

03:13.782 --> 03:21.309
lived a relatively comfortable life. We were not 
wealthy by any means. My father was a salary

03:24.332 --> 03:25.913
employee. But he was never out of work. And my 
mother did not work at that time and didn't have to.

03:36.656 --> 03:42.203
So I really don't have any recollections of that. I 
guess when we moved to Georgia, that might have

03:42.243 --> 03:47.189
been part of the job scene. I really don't 
remember. But I didn't come out of that with any

03:49.492 --> 03:54.618
terrible memories by any means. What about 
brothers and sisters? I have one brother who lives

03:57.766 --> 03:59.529
in Montgomery. He's a little bit older than I am. 
He's an investment banker there. He's lived there

04:04.476 --> 04:12.027
all his life except for college and the service.

04:12.047 --> 04:15.091
After you completed your bachelor's at Auburn, 
what did you do then? I was in ROTC at Auburn. And in

04:19.177 --> 04:22.161
1952, the Korean War was going on. So everyone who 
got a commission in the ROTC had to go to the

04:27.263 --> 04:35.533
service, so I went to the Air Force and spent three 
or four months in this country. I went in August of

04:37.055 --> 04:56.038
52 and spent some time at Fort Benning, Georgia and 
Langley Field, Virginia, and then was sent to

04:37.055 --> 04:56.038
Korea in, I believe it was April of 53, in early 
1953, and was there for one year. Came back, and

04:57.200 --> 05:01.767
then when I got back, I was discharged after 20 
months. In this interim, the Korean War, the

05:02.788 --> 05:06.153
truce, I guess, was signed. So all of a sudden, they 
had a need for no, certainly a less need for people

05:06.193 --> 05:14.786
in my category, so they mustered out a bunch of us. 
And I went to work for the highway department in

05:15.747 --> 05:23.679
Montgomery and spent another year and a half or so 
there. When did you go to work for the highway

05:24.159 --> 05:26.683
department? Just after I got out of the service. It 
must have been the summer of 53

05:29.483 --> 05:37.371
or 54, I guess. Summer of 54. And how long did you 
hold that position? Well, I stayed there. I was

05:44.078 --> 05:57.092
what was called a bridge design engineer and so I 
worked on designing bridges and enjoyed it for

05:44.078 --> 05:57.092
about six months and then found out I was repeating 
myself lost its interest. So I decided to go back to

06:00.188 --> 06:01.970
graduate school. And so I worked until the fall of 
1955. And in the meantime, of course, I'd applied

06:06.814 --> 06:11.058
for graduate school and been accepted. And so I 
went to graduate school in September of 55. Where?

06:15.882 --> 06:18.144
University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. And 
you completed your master's work there? Yes, in

06:21.207 --> 06:24.449
1957 and PhD in 1959. What was the topic of your 
dissertation? The topic was a numerical study of

06:28.342 --> 06:35.648
the vibrations of spherical shells. The 
motivation was the

06:37.130 --> 06:57.167
behavior of shell structures under dynamic 
loading, such as blasts, and primarily blasts

06:37.130 --> 06:57.167
that were sponsored by the Air Force, 
earthquakes, any sort of dynamic load that might

06:58.362 --> 07:00.044
strike a structure. And the particular 
structures I was interested in was spherical

07:00.064 --> 07:02.506
shells. So I did a computer study of the vibration 
characteristics and then did a little bit on what

07:02.526 --> 07:15.700
happens if a particular kind of blast pulse 
impacts on a spherical structure. It was one of the

07:17.061 --> 07:24.509
earlier digital

07:17.061 --> 07:24.509
computer studies of structures. This was when the 
computer business was just beginning. And

07:29.243 --> 07:34.329
Illinois had a homemade computer that was one of 
the pioneers. Not the pioneer, obviously, but one

07:34.429 --> 07:38.194
of the earlier of this kind of computer. So I did use 
that to do the calculations for my thesis.

07:48.146 --> 07:49.127
What about your family? I married. I have three 
children. When did you marry? In 1960.

07:58.657 --> 08:15.137
And I have three children, a boy who will be a 
freshman at the University of Texas next fall in

07:58.657 --> 08:15.137
September, a girl who will be a senior at Bryan High 
in September, and a 12-year-old who will be in the

07:58.657 --> 08:15.137
seventh grade at St. Michael's Academy.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.362
Where is your wife originally from? She's from 
California, Southern California. After you got

08:23.367 --> 08:28.073
your doctorate in 1959, what did you do then? and 
went to work for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in

08:28.576 --> 08:35.244
Sunnyvale, California. They were just 
beginning, well, they were in the early stages of

08:35.264 --> 08:50.102
getting the missile and space satellite 
business, and I went to work in the space satellite

08:35.264 --> 08:50.102
part of what later became the Lockheed Missiles 
and Space Company. It's in, as I say, in Sunnyvale,

08:51.123 --> 08:55.208
which now is called Silicon Valley as well, that 
activities going on in microcomputer chips and

08:56.656 --> 08:59.780
that kind of thing. That of course was not, that 
wasn't even on the horizon I don't think at that

08:59.960 --> 09:04.285
time. I worked in structural dynamics for them and 
stayed there three years. That's where I met my

09:10.992 --> 09:15.257
wife and we were married as I say in 1960.

09:19.001 --> 09:24.047
When I was there I lived in Saratoga which is a 
small, was at the time a small community

09:25.495 --> 09:27.337
just on the outskirts of San Jose. Of course, the 
whole place has been paved now. The whole valley is

09:30.141 --> 09:33.886
completely changed. In 1962, you left Lockheed. 
Where did you go then? Went to Raleigh, North

09:38.332 --> 09:39.674
Carolina. I got a job as an assistant professor at 
North Carolina State in civil engineering. And so

09:49.487 --> 09:54.253
we moved to Raleigh in August of 62, and I started 
teaching. in September. And how long did you hold

09:57.231 --> 09:59.274
that position? I was assistant professor until, I 
believe it was three years, and then was promoted

09:59.294 --> 10:14.374
to associate professor, and stayed there two more 
years,

09:59.294 --> 10:14.374
and then left NC State. And I got tenure and all 
that, and I got promoted. Well, those two things

10:18.820 --> 10:21.844
were simultaneous, tenure and promotion. So I 
left in 67 and went back to work for Lockheed again,

10:23.157 --> 10:31.366
but this time as a department manager at a research 
center in Huntsville, Alabama. They were working

10:31.386 --> 10:36.192
with NASA in the space program primarily. And I was 
the manager of the structures department there.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.141
And you stayed there from 67 to when? Till 72. Well,

10:45.662 --> 10:52.590
late 72. become a little bit disenchanted with 
industry. And Lockheed wanted to transfer me back

10:57.002 --> 11:04.633
to California, and I didn't want to do that, nor did 
my family want to move back there. And I had thought

11:04.853 --> 11:09.299
perhaps the educational game was where I would be 
anyhow. I had met the department head, Dr. Sampson

11:10.660 --> 11:18.551
was department head at that time, and I knew him 
from professional activities, professional

11:10.660 --> 11:18.551
organizations. So I called him to see what the seen 
in academia was. And so that initial call led to my

11:26.455 --> 11:29.720
coming down here. And you came here in 1973? Yeah, 
January 1973. As an instructor, I mean as a

11:34.347 --> 11:37.351
professor in civil engineering? Yes. Okay, and 
how long were you a professor of civil

11:39.374 --> 11:42.979
engineering? Well, I still am, so eight and a half 
years, I guess. You became department head in

11:48.606 --> 11:50.369
1979? Yes, August the 1st was when I started. What 
are some of your duties here as department head?

11:58.805 --> 12:09.838
Well, I guess it's like any other department head 
to administer the affairs of the department, the

11:58.805 --> 12:09.838
fiscal and the personnel and the academic 
program. Obviously, any department,

12:10.719 --> 12:21.032
particularly one this size, one can't do that 
alone and shouldn't do that, shouldn't try to do

12:10.719 --> 12:21.032
that. But I'm responsible for coordinating all of 
those activities in the department, reporting to

12:22.312 --> 12:28.480
the dean of engineering.

12:31.404 --> 12:36.651
About how many faculty members are there in the 
civil engineering department? We have

12:36.671 --> 12:42.319
several, 65 to 70. I forget the specific number of 
people who are in either tenure track or tenured

12:42.379 --> 12:49.829
positions, assistant professor and above. In 
addition to those, we have have something like a

12:52.501 --> 12:56.768
dozen or so people in lecturer positions. 
Totally, though, each of the two major semesters

12:58.591 --> 13:09.508
will have something like 100 people involved in 
the teaching program if you add in teaching

12:58.591 --> 13:09.508
assistants and then the lecturers into the 
regular faculty. Oh, well, I shouldn't say it that

13:11.190 --> 13:12.733
way. Teaching assistants into the faculty. 
Certainly, I did not mean to exclude lecturers

13:15.036 --> 13:18.762
from faculty.

13:21.273 --> 13:23.836
What are some of the schools that these faculty 
members are from? We have them from all over. We

13:27.201 --> 13:29.524
have several, of course, from A&M. I'd say a fairly 
large number from A&M, but we have people from the

13:31.867 --> 13:46.386
University of Illinois, the University of 
California at Berkeley, University of Texas,

13:31.867 --> 13:46.386
Texas Tech,

13:31.867 --> 13:46.386
just about Well, I won't say all over, but 
certainly representative throughout the

13:47.986 --> 13:51.471
country.

13:54.876 --> 14:03.869
Probably those I named,

13:54.876 --> 14:03.869
I would say the preponderance of people with 
advanced degrees got them in those schools. But

14:03.889 --> 14:06.533
certainly there are a lot of them. Are faculty 
members expected to devote time between research

14:08.596 --> 14:13.183
and teaching? Yes, most of the faculty in the 
department are involved in one way or another in

14:14.767 --> 14:19.934
the research program. Could you explain more 
about the research program?

14:31.451 --> 14:38.901
The faculty members in the CE department work in 
every conceivable field almost in research. and

14:39.607 --> 14:45.376
what is generally called civil engineering, and 
some things which are not normally considered to

14:39.607 --> 14:45.376
be classical civil engineering. Most of our 
research is administered in either the Texas

14:46.878 --> 14:56.072
Engineering Experiment Station or the Texas 
Transportation Institute.

14:58.676 --> 15:06.829
In fact, the faculty members will hold a joint 
appointment with those two state agencies, as

14:58.676 --> 15:06.829
well as an appointment as, say, a professor or 
whatever. with the university in the civil

15:07.265 --> 15:12.774
engineering department.

15:12.794 --> 15:18.884
We like to encourage the faculty to do research and 
also to publish the results of their research. We

15:19.886 --> 15:25.735
feel that that's just one more service in teaching 
that we have, one more function that we should

15:19.886 --> 15:25.735
perform. It's involved and intimately involved 
with our teaching, actually, particularly with

15:27.158 --> 15:33.508
the graduate teaching program. Could you discuss 
specifically some of the research projects that

15:35.935 --> 15:42.243
are underway now or have been completed in the last 
several years? Well, that would take all day, but

15:43.965 --> 16:02.770
one of the larger projects and one of the important 
ones, I think, is an environmental impact of the

15:43.965 --> 16:02.770
Strategic Petroleum Reserve that our 
Environmental Engineering Division is involved

15:43.965 --> 16:02.770
in. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a program 
by the federal government to store large

16:04.657 --> 16:18.509
quantities of petroleum oil in very large salt 
domes. Salt domes are subterranean, and they're

16:18.549 --> 16:23.413
extremely stable. Well, to put the oil in, you have 
to pump the brine out. And so what the government

16:29.078 --> 16:33.162
will be doing is depositing high concentrations 
of brine in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil displaces

16:33.580 --> 16:40.307
the brine from the dome. The government obviously 
wanted to know what the environmental impact of

16:42.930 --> 16:49.437
that large slug of brine would be. So we're really 
program managers of a multidisciplinary program

16:49.597 --> 17:02.912
involving scientists and oceanographers and 
biologists as well as engineers. instrumenting

17:03.398 --> 17:07.724
and monitoring the impact of this brine. Another 
program is a program with the Air Force. The Air

17:16.715 --> 17:29.271
Force is interested in people who, well, in two 
things, in developing the general field of the use

17:16.715 --> 17:29.271
of composite materials and also in educating 
engineers who are knowledgeable in design and use

17:30.314 --> 17:33.097
of composite materials. So we have a program 
sponsored by the Air Force that's both education

17:33.117 --> 17:51.379
and teaching, and a classroom education, that 
kind of education as opposed to research, in which

17:33.117 --> 17:51.379
the faculty carry out a research program in the use 
and manufacturing, design, and so on, of

17:33.117 --> 17:51.379
composite materials. And I also conduct a degree 
program so that people with BS degrees in

17:52.380 --> 17:59.629
engineering can come here, study for a year, and 
get master's degrees in some field of

18:00.098 --> 18:17.482
engineering, but with the emphasis on the design 
and use of composite materials so they can now

18:00.098 --> 18:17.482
return to the aircraft industry and apply these 
newly discovered skills to the use of composite.

18:17.502 --> 18:26.815
Composite materials are sort of, in one sense, the 
wave of the future in structural design in certain

18:17.502 --> 18:26.815
applications because of a very high strength to 
weight ratio. And naturally, if you can have

18:29.368 --> 18:33.712
something very strong that doesn't weigh very 
much, then the aircraft people are interested in

18:29.368 --> 18:33.712
it. But now, of course, there's more and more 
interest in the automotive industry and the

18:34.793 --> 18:41.080
application of composites. Because if you save a 
pound of weight in an automobile, that's a certain

18:41.180 --> 18:51.831
amount of savings in gasoline that you don't have 
to spend to push that pound around the road. Let's

18:54.314 --> 18:57.257
see, there are other programs.

18:59.414 --> 19:12.527
We've had programs in the study of the

18:59.414 --> 19:12.527
behavior of subsurface, well, the ocean bottom. 
It turns out that in certain areas of the Gulf, the

19:12.547 --> 19:23.337
ocean bottom is a very uncohesive material. And 
due to the wave action in storms, the wave action

19:29.367 --> 19:35.956
can trigger huge slides, mudslides, as it were, on 
the bottom of the ocean. Even though the slopes of

19:37.017 --> 19:48.593
the ocean bottom are not very large, the material 
is so uncohesive that it won't stick together,

19:37.017 --> 19:48.593
that it'll move under these high pressures. 
Naturally, the oil companies or the companies who

19:49.734 --> 19:57.585
have that drilling are very interested in that 
because if the whole floor of the ocean starts

19:49.734 --> 19:57.585
moving, there's not a lot that, Well, it certainly 
has an impact on the drilling rig, drilling

19:58.763 --> 20:02.967
platforms. So we, in the geotechnical 
engineering division, have been studying the

20:02.987 --> 20:21.224
effect of these mudslides and the forces 
generated by the mudslides so that we can then take

20:02.987 --> 20:21.224
their results and see what the impact on the 
drilling rigs would be. And then the next obvious

20:21.624 --> 20:27.690
question is what procedures or how can we design 
the... drilling rigs to resist these very large

20:28.970 --> 20:33.215
forces that are generated by these slides. You 
could go on and on. Basically, this might add a

20:38.981 --> 20:52.436
little to this, basically we have, the civil 
engineering department has six groups, we call

20:38.981 --> 20:52.436
them, major areas, major administrative 
subdivisions. These are ocean and coastal

20:52.456 --> 20:58.723
engineering, environmental engineering, 
structures, construction and materials,

20:59.952 --> 21:13.569
geotechnical, or I guess we call it 
geoengineering, and civil systems engineering.

21:15.472 --> 21:21.439
If you look at the details of this, this covers 
pretty much the broad spectrum of civil

21:15.472 --> 21:21.439
engineering activity. And we have a research 
program in every one of those areas covering many

21:22.381 --> 21:29.790
facets of the business.

21:33.398 --> 21:37.444
Could you explain briefly in layman's terms what a 
civil engineer does? The layman's term is not the

21:39.327 --> 21:42.191
problem. The problem is the breadth of the field. I 
guess this is very simplistic, but in a sense,

21:46.116 --> 22:02.460
civil engineers are the people who design, 
construct, maintain, and run the machinery of

21:46.116 --> 22:02.460
civilization. By this, I mean all those things, 
those engineered works that are basic to running

22:02.609 --> 22:31.873
the civilization, the transportation network, 
the water supply,

22:02.609 --> 22:31.873
disposing of the waste, constructing the 
buildings, designing the facility, designing

22:02.609 --> 22:31.873
the bridges, designing and supervising 
construction of the

22:34.486 --> 22:43.780
all the appurtenances and all the buildings that 
go along with all these things, the sewer plants

22:34.486 --> 22:43.780
and such, maintaining all of these, developing 
new materials. We have a big program, for example,

22:44.381 --> 23:00.105
in the Texas Transportation Institute in the 
development of asphaltic materials that would be

22:44.381 --> 23:00.105
used in highways and other parking lots and other 
things where they use large volumes of asphalt

22:44.381 --> 23:00.105
paving.

23:03.207 --> 23:16.382
Involving all of this, of course, would be the 
economic studies as to determine the best

23:03.207 --> 23:16.382
approach, where to locate the facilities, what's 
the best way. And by that, I mean the most, say,

23:16.402 --> 23:23.190
cost-effective way to design them and to 
construct them. So the economics of the matter, as

23:23.210 --> 23:29.738
in all engineering, really, the economics of the 
matter gets into it very, very heavily. But

23:31.709 --> 23:33.332
there's really no limit. That's kind of classical 
civil engineering. But if you look at where our

23:36.617 --> 23:47.356
graduates go, a large percentage, a significant 
percentage, I don't know the figure, but a

23:36.617 --> 23:47.356
significant percentage of our students go to work 
for the oil companies. Well, obviously, because

23:47.816 --> 23:50.882
here in Texas, that's a very important industry. 
And they're hiring people with technical

23:50.902 --> 23:53.987
backgrounds.

23:57.005 --> 24:01.673
How many hours does it take to get the bachelor's 
degree here in civil engineering? Semester

24:01.693 --> 24:02.334
hours? It takes 146 in our current program. And how 
many for the master's and PhD?

24:11.369 --> 24:12.571
It gets a little less rigid. There's a specified 
curriculum in the undergraduate program. I

24:17.839 --> 24:20.223
believe it's 16 hours, no more than that. 16 hours 
of technical electives, but then we have some

24:20.584 --> 24:23.248
other electives. total of about 25 hours of 
electives. But it all adds up to 146. For the master

24:30.262 --> 24:36.410
of engineering degree, the minimum is 36 hours. 
But there, you look a little more closely at a

24:36.510 --> 24:42.237
person's background and interest. Where does the 
student want to go when he finishes here? And what

24:45.841 --> 24:48.424
kind of work does he want to get into? And you might 
require a few more hours, just depending on the

24:53.823 --> 24:55.966
background, what he's had, and so on. The master of 
science degree requires 32 hours, but of course,

24:56.647 --> 25:01.153
you have to write a thesis. We require a thesis for 
the master of science degree.

25:06.101 --> 25:13.972
The PhD, for the PhD, the graduate college 
requires a minimum of 96 after the bachelor's

25:06.101 --> 25:13.972
degree. Again, if it's appropriate, we'll 
require more than that. That's a minimum

25:18.698 --> 25:19.780
requirement. And of course, a significant maybe 
25% or 30% of those hours, depending on the

25:21.683 --> 25:30.275
student, would be taken up with this 
dissertation. Now, that's about right. Usually,

25:33.639 --> 25:37.985
we'll give maybe 20 credits for the dissertation, 
20 semester hours. But those are only minimum

25:38.005 --> 25:40.228
requirements. And if it's appropriate, we'll go 
over that. About how many students are now

25:42.972 --> 25:46.016
enrolled in civil engineering here? Last fall, we 
had

25:52.818 --> 26:08.555
something like 850,

25:52.818 --> 26:08.555
I believe was the figure, undergraduate in civil 
and 115

25:52.818 --> 26:08.555
undergraduates in the ocean engineering 
program, which is a degree program in civil

25:52.818 --> 26:08.555
engineering department. And on top of that, 150 
graduate students. All those figures probably

26:15.403 --> 26:22.791
don't add up, but it added up to around 1,200 
students, undergraduates as well as graduates in

26:15.403 --> 26:22.791
both civil and ocean engineering. Do you have any 
women students in civil engineering? Yes, that's

26:31.304 --> 26:33.427
another interesting thing. I think this is a 
national observation too, but it seems that that

26:33.467 --> 26:39.516
percentage is rising. We've had on the order of 
about 12% of our undergraduate student body has

26:39.596 --> 26:45.865
been women over the past several years. That seems 
to be going up a little bit. I think with this coming

26:48.289 --> 26:51.934
fall enrollment, we'll probably see an increase. 
Certainly a trend of increasing the number of the

26:52.724 --> 26:59.275
percent of the female, of students that are 
female. What about black students in

26:59.695 --> 27:03.241
engineering? We don't have very many. That's a 
very difficult problem. We've had them.

27:07.548 --> 27:12.176
Certainly we would love to have more, but we don't 
have very many right now. We do have some. Why do you

27:13.518 --> 27:16.062
think you have so few blacks in engineering? I 
don't know. The only thing, whatever I would say

27:17.324 --> 27:19.828
would be just... opinion. I don't have any hard 
data. I suspect that because of the availability

27:23.574 --> 27:38.771
of Prairie View, well, a lot of our students come 
from the Houston-Harris County area, and

27:23.574 --> 27:38.771
proximity of Prairie View to Houston, I would 
suspect, draws off a number of them. But that's, if

27:38.791 --> 27:43.337
you really want to know the answer to that, I think 
you'd have to ask somebody who looked into it. What

27:44.318 --> 27:46.440
about foreign students in civil engineering? We 
don't have many in the undergraduate program. We

27:49.283 --> 27:49.984
have So 25% or 30% of our graduate program is 
foreign students. That seems also to be rising. I

27:57.167 --> 28:12.688
suspect we could, I'm not sure we could double, but 
certainly increase significantly the number of

27:57.167 --> 28:12.688
foreign students in the graduate program if we 
would reduce our requirements on the language. We

28:13.229 --> 28:18.216
still try to stick pretty rigidly to a language 
requirement. The students who come here from

28:19.512 --> 28:36.933
foreign countries, we require them to be 
reasonably proficient in the language because we

28:19.512 --> 28:36.933
don't think it's right to slow down the other 
students with a large contingent of students in a

28:19.512 --> 28:36.933
classroom who are not reasonably good at the 
language. Are you talking about foreign students

28:36.953 --> 28:39.076
who have difficulty with English? Yes, yes. You 
require foreign languages then for the Ph.D. in

28:42.520 --> 28:46.144
civil engineering? No. That language 
requirement was dropped several years before I

28:46.776 --> 28:49.960
came here. So we have no language

28:52.444 --> 28:56.509
requirement. What you're referring to then there 
is the fact that some farm students have

28:56.529 --> 29:01.056
difficulty speaking English. It's like anyone 
born in one country learning another language as a

29:01.076 --> 29:07.204
foreign language, certainly. Any one of us would 
have trouble with winter school in France or

29:08.450 --> 29:11.553
wherever. What are the average salary that a 
beginning civil engineer with a bachelor's

29:11.573 --> 29:17.819
degree can expect? That's changing so rapidly, 
it's hard to keep up. I would say, though,

29:20.842 --> 29:29.670
that $20,000 to $25,000 a year would not be unusual 
at all. People who go to work for municipalities

29:31.272 --> 29:36.617
and some of the other government agencies might 
not get as high salaries. People who go to work for

29:38.938 --> 29:42.121
the oil companies who are outstanding students 
would go above that. But that's a range, average

29:42.942 --> 29:45.285
range. What about with a PhD in civil engineering? 
How much more salary would they expect? That's so

29:51.292 --> 29:57.819
broad that it's almost impossible to answer. 
There's not enough data to peg any average

29:57.839 --> 30:04.427
figures, but certainly above $30,000 a year. Do 
you have any figures or any estimate on what

30:06.247 --> 30:13.835
percent of students in the engineering college 
are in the civil engineering department? Well, I

30:13.855 --> 30:15.456
can pull out some figures in a hurry. Last fall, 
there were, let's say, 1,200 students in civil,

30:15.937 --> 30:29.491
and there were 10,500 approximately students in 
the college. Now, those are not all engineering

30:30.512 --> 30:32.694
students. There are some degree programs in the 
College of Engineering that are not engineering,

30:35.930 --> 30:40.135
not programs leading to bachelor's degree in 
engineering. That's total, the undergraduate

30:40.155 --> 30:42.178
and graduate. So whatever 1,200 is as a percent of 
10,000. So it's about 10%, 11%, something like

30:44.802 --> 30:48.306
that. Probably 12, yeah.

30:52.311 --> 30:57.838
When you came in 1973, do you recall how many civil 
engineering students there were at that time? I

30:58.239 --> 30:58.740
don't have that. I mean, I have the number. I just 
don't have it right before me. I would say...

31:06.170 --> 31:20.247
probably in the order total again comparing that 
1200 figure on the order of six or 800, something

31:06.170 --> 31:20.247
like that.

31:20.267 --> 31:23.751
How does civil engineers compare to other 
engineers in salary ranges? That's a changing

31:25.574 --> 31:27.055
thing. And also the impact over the past two years 
of The demand for petroleum engineers and

31:33.001 --> 31:37.588
chemical engineers have just changed the picture 
completely. But two years ago, I would have

31:37.628 --> 31:54.775
answered that civil engineers probably run a 
little behind mechanicals and electricals and

31:37.628 --> 31:54.775
petroleum or chemicals, perhaps, but ahead of 
aerospace and some of the others. That's

31:56.378 --> 31:58.781
changing, and it will probably change. I know it 
will change in the future, for example, if the

32:01.807 --> 32:09.116
government goes ahead with the large defense 
program, that will impact the demand for

32:01.807 --> 32:09.116
aerospace engineers. So the whole thing will 
change. Some of the petroleum engineers, the

32:10.818 --> 32:19.949
salaries for the graduates of petroleum 
engineers are something that we would not have

32:10.818 --> 32:19.949
dreamed of even two or three years ago. We're 
probably average or a little below, though, if you

32:22.092 --> 32:27.579
take out all those extreme data points. I wouldn't 
say it's enough. I personally would not think it's

32:30.764 --> 32:35.292
enough to impact anyone's career decision. It's 
not that significant.

32:40.261 --> 32:48.014
Do you have any idea on how the civil engineering 
program at Texas A&M ranks with programs at other

32:40.261 --> 32:48.014
universities? No, you see figures on those things 
and sometimes we appear in the ratings and

32:48.034 --> 32:53.464
sometimes we don't. I'm very skeptical of those. I 
guess if A&M's civil engineering department

32:55.667 --> 33:01.154
always came in at number one, I'd say they were very 
accurate. But nevertheless, it's terribly hard

33:01.814 --> 33:07.641
for me to see what those ratings mean. When you say 
the best, I don't know what the terms are. I believe

33:13.288 --> 33:23.620
quite often that the way those ratings are made, 
what they're really relating is the current

33:24.207 --> 33:37.441
gossip among academicians,

33:24.207 --> 33:37.441
and also probably more heavily reflective of the 
graduate program, because that's really where

33:24.207 --> 33:37.441
publicity comes quite often. But the only thing I 
can say, I guess we have shown up in those, and we've

33:38.823 --> 33:43.448
not shown up in others. But certainly, I 
personally think we're in the top 20. But that's,

33:49.334 --> 33:50.856
again, a subjective judgment.

33:56.472 --> 34:01.579
What are some of the changes that you've seen since 
you came here eight years ago, in those eight

33:56.472 --> 34:01.579
years? Regarding what? Regarding civil 
engineering. In the department? Well, certainly

34:05.564 --> 34:09.049
increasing the number of students, increasing 
the faculty. We now have been able to attract

34:10.811 --> 34:22.547
several young, very, very promising assistant 
professors.

34:24.063 --> 34:33.594
I think as time goes on,

34:24.063 --> 34:33.594
the department will tend to get, and in fact right 
now, is tending to get a little younger. Not that we

34:34.555 --> 34:40.562
are terribly old in the sense of the faculty 
department by any means, but there are some people

34:34.555 --> 34:40.562
retiring. And because of the increasing number of 
students we have, we've had positions and have

34:41.683 --> 34:48.271
been able to fill them with younger people. I think 
the department is becoming more oriented towards

34:53.560 --> 34:59.928
research, though I'm convinced not to the 
detriment of our teaching program. We have not

35:01.029 --> 35:06.295
changed there on our feelings of the importance of 
the undergraduate teaching program. I think we

35:07.557 --> 35:19.411
feel that we can continue to have a strong 
undergraduate teaching program in spite of a

35:07.557 --> 35:19.411
growing and changing, to a certain extent, 
changing research program. The facilities have

35:20.713 --> 35:23.196
not changed. That's one of our problems, but 
there's some light on the horizon as far as our

35:23.800 --> 35:30.387
facilities are concerned. We're getting more 
office space. We're going to have available in a

35:33.651 --> 35:38.776
couple of years a graduate research laboratory. I 
guess I'm telling you what we'd like to see change

35:41.078 --> 35:51.850
rather than what I have seen change, but we'd like 
to see improvement in our undergraduate teaching

35:41.078 --> 35:51.850
laboratories, which We're in very bad shape 
there. The curriculum has changed. The

35:59.438 --> 36:02.881
curriculum, as I said earlier, has reached 146 
semester hours. That's gone up over the past. In

36:06.404 --> 36:08.066
fact, that went up just two years ago.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.931
The topics covered in the curriculum have 
changed. We think that our curriculum, as far as

36:15.032 --> 36:22.039
the topics covered, is probably about as broad and 
also as modern as any in the country. We have not

36:25.345 --> 36:29.850
responded to fads so much as other places have. So 
the changes, I think, that we've made in the

36:30.971 --> 36:34.515
curriculum have been very positive changes.

36:37.758 --> 36:40.681
What are some of the fads that other colleges have 
changed? Well, during the post-Sputnik era, so

36:41.262 --> 36:50.271
many engineering colleges became colleges of 
engineering science. I can't take any credit for

36:51.685 --> 37:21.625
resisting that because I was not here but A&M by and 
large resisted that keeping in mind that

36:51.685 --> 37:21.625
engineering is a profession and that engineers 
are charged with the actual design and

36:51.685 --> 37:21.625
implementation not just analysis of various 
things engineering works and so we have continued

36:51.685 --> 37:21.625
to have a very practical bent that is where we want 
our graduates to be able to go out, A&M, and

37:22.111 --> 37:34.469
actually take responsible charge of the design 
and construction of engineered works. Some of the

37:35.831 --> 37:43.642
other schools, I believe, became more, also with 
the advent of computers, became more heavily

37:35.831 --> 37:43.642
analytically oriented. And there are students in 
some of these places that students really are not

37:45.325 --> 37:51.173
prepared to function as engineers, in my 
judgment. as well as ours are. Have you seen a

37:54.627 --> 37:59.774
change in the quality of the student entering 
civil engineering in the last eight years? I think

38:01.717 --> 38:04.080
so. In fact, I think in even a shorter period of time 
than that, the quality has gone up. Now, I could be

38:12.231 --> 38:20.181
just reacting or reflecting various scores that 
I've seen, the average SAT score, for example, for

38:20.549 --> 38:28.159
entering engineering students is now, I believe 
this is right, is the highest of any of the colleges

38:20.549 --> 38:28.159
at A&M. That's a change from the past several 
years. With my own classroom teaching, the

38:31.022 --> 38:41.736
students are, I believe, are better as students, 
reflecting also a national trend, I think. The

38:41.856 --> 38:50.387
students are much more interested in getting 
useful and much more pragmatic. They want to learn

38:53.732 --> 39:01.979
things in the classroom where they can see a direct 
use, a direct application when they get out of

38:53.732 --> 39:01.979
here. I personally think that's something the 
faculty have to resist. It's impossible, I think,

39:08.565 --> 39:13.649
to identify any practical use with everything 
that you do. I think what we have to do is educate

39:14.650 --> 39:21.336
them as well as we see fit to be good, broad, solid 
practicing engineers. But the students are, I

39:24.860 --> 39:28.625
believe, much more pragmatic than they were 
several years ago. But I believe they're better

39:29.165 --> 39:30.367
students. They certainly seem to want to get on 
with the program, as it were. Of course, they're

39:35.694 --> 39:37.115
always the exception. Well, that would seem a 
conflict that general apparent prevailing

39:37.135 --> 39:45.606
public opinion that the quality of students is 
decreasing. We have pretty high admission

39:45.626 --> 39:47.429
standards. And A&M has high admission standards. 
Engineering tends to get those students who, of

39:52.147 --> 40:05.424
course, are interested in and thereby probably 
more proficient than average in technical

39:52.147 --> 40:05.424
subjects, mathematics and science and so on. But I 
believe that all my colleagues have told me the

40:06.385 --> 40:14.315
same thing, at least the ones with whom I've 
discussed this. But I think that the quality of

40:15.016 --> 40:19.842
students that we're getting in this college and 
this department is generally tending to

40:15.016 --> 40:19.842
increase.

40:24.563 --> 40:26.165
I said one thing about the women students. The 
women students, the early women students, again,

40:27.107 --> 40:36.820
this is a subjective reaction, were better on 
average than the men students. We had some

40:38.062 --> 40:41.907
outstanding, and still do, we had outstanding 
women students. As more and more women enter the

40:41.927 --> 40:52.562
program, though, I think, as you would expect, 
they seem to be about as good, but not any better or

40:41.927 --> 40:52.562
any worse than the average male student. Many 
grades and all that would support that. I don't

40:54.823 --> 40:55.163
know. Again, that's a subjective judgment. Do you 
have any figures on what percent of the students

40:57.886 --> 41:03.654
who start a program in civil engineering finally 
finish the master's degree? No, I don't. We could

41:06.077 --> 41:06.738
get those. I just don't remember what they are. We 
do have a kind of peculiar, what I think is

41:08.921 --> 41:12.385
peculiar, anomaly.

41:15.089 --> 41:22.178
Most of the time, when you think of a four-year 
curriculum, you think, at least I would think

41:15.089 --> 41:22.178
normally, that the largest group would be the 
freshmen. the next largest the sophomores, and so

41:22.495 --> 41:24.677
on down. That's not the case here. The largest 
group we have are the seniors. We're just almost

41:29.042 --> 41:30.964
completely reversed. Our freshman class tends to 
be smaller than the sophomore, which tends to be,

41:32.005 --> 41:40.633
although there are exceptions, than the junior, 
and the senior being the largest of them all. We get

41:41.675 --> 41:48.081
a lot of transfers, students who started in other 
fields of engineering at A&M, and also students

41:41.675 --> 41:48.081
who go to the first two or three years at other 
colleges and then transfer in. So the transfers

41:54.615 --> 42:03.124
tend to swell our upper division classes as 
compared to the freshmen. We don't have a large

42:04.405 --> 42:07.088
attrition rate, though, I don't believe. We lose 
some, of course, but we don't lose a lot of students

42:07.148 --> 42:13.094
to just flunking out. I mean, with a freshman class 
in the top quarter of their high school class, And

42:18.959 --> 42:25.650
good SAT scores, you wouldn't expect to lose a big 
bunch. Do you have any notion of what that average

42:25.670 --> 42:31.639
SAT score is for people in this program? Not in 
civil. In engineering, it was, I believe it was the

42:32.200 --> 42:35.626
last fall, it was on the order. It was between 1050 
and 1100. I forget the figures. I don't want to

42:39.752 --> 42:40.714
quote a wrong figure. I believe it was around 1070. 
I'm just trying to drag that up from my memory, but

42:43.765 --> 42:46.869
it was on that order. I do remember, though, it was 
the highest of all the colleges A&M. It was the

42:50.354 --> 42:51.195
highest average. That's on which test? That's the 
SAT. I thought the SAT used a scale of 1 through 30.

42:57.303 --> 42:57.563
No. They must have changed their scale. They quote 
them in, it's an arbitrary scale, but as I

42:59.726 --> 43:11.361
remember, 1,000, a total of 1,000, is real close to 
the 50th percentile. Could you tell us briefly,

43:13.263 --> 43:19.011
what the future outlook of civil engineers for the 
80s would be in your judgment? I think it looks

43:19.031 --> 43:19.832
good. I think all engineering looks good. Civil 
engineering has the trend, the tendency, is for it

43:22.816 --> 43:39.658
to follow the population, if nothing else, 
because as the population expands, we have a

43:22.816 --> 43:39.658
greater need for all those things that support the 
population, transportation and sanitary.

43:42.682 --> 43:42.882
But Even now, I was told the other day that if you 
compare new student acceptances for the fall, the

43:43.435 --> 43:58.757
first of June figures, compare new student 
acceptances for the fall with the same figures for

43:43.435 --> 43:58.757
last year, we're up 9%. This kind of just continues 
the trend that's been going on for years. We've

44:06.167 --> 44:07.549
been growing. The civil engineering enrollment 
here has been growing more or less linearly. with

44:12.325 --> 44:15.848
some wiggles in the lines, of course, but more or 
less linearly for the last decade. I think that

44:17.950 --> 44:20.993
that shows all signs of continuing. Certainly, 
the demand for civil engineers is probably going

44:21.033 --> 44:25.217
to continue. Also, the fact that civil 
engineering here, at least, the civil

44:27.159 --> 44:38.670
engineering graduates have a pretty broad 
education, that is something that a lot of the

44:39.494 --> 44:42.858
major companies want, the major oil companies, 
for example. If they can't hire petroleum

44:42.878 --> 44:47.322
engineers, they're happy with civils or 
mechanicals. And so there's a demand there for

44:47.683 --> 44:55.511
civil engineers in what's considered not to be a 
classical civil engineering field. So I'd say

44:56.552 --> 45:00.336
that the 80s look good. In fact, if you look at the 
demographics, there might be a small drop in

45:00.516 --> 45:09.045
availability of high school students, certainly 
a small drop nationally an even smaller drop in

45:09.363 --> 45:17.054
Texas of people graduating from high schools who 
would be going to college next. So if anything,

45:18.176 --> 45:38.104
that might mean, from a demand point of view, that 
if the demand continues to rise and then there is a

45:18.176 --> 45:38.104
smaller group of people who are going to be going 
through the colleges, that those people who do go

45:18.176 --> 45:38.104
through the colleges in engineering are going to 
have even better job opportunities, I'd say. I

45:38.759 --> 45:40.020
know it's somewhat contradictory. I'm not really 
even sure that that's going to affect our

45:40.040 --> 45:44.085
enrollments. The drop in the number of high school 
students from the figures I've seen at least seem

45:44.285 --> 45:51.814
to be fairly small in Texas. But I'd say that just 
generally as a career that it will probably

45:51.834 --> 45:59.322
continue to be good. We're less subject to some of 
the fluctuations of some of the other

45:59.722 --> 46:05.529
engineering. For example, the aerospace 
industry. tend to be much more, to fluctuate much

46:08.746 --> 46:12.873
more than civil engineering. Well, aerospace 
industry was in a slump for many years in the 70s,

46:12.893 --> 46:16.579
wasn't it? Yes, sure was. And it's just now 
beginning to climb up out of that. Petroleum

46:20.225 --> 46:25.754
engineers, you had a very difficult time getting 
petroleum engineering graduates jobs a while

46:20.225 --> 46:25.754
back. But now, of course, it's just the sky's the 
limit.

46:31.664 --> 46:34.348
OK, we're going to turn the tape, and I want to ask 
you about that. Tell me about that railroad

46:34.615 --> 46:36.680
charity we're talking about. I put that on the 
tape. It's fixing to run off, though. OK. How much

46:40.751 --> 46:41.914
longer do you think you want? About 10 more 
minutes. You pressed to go somewhere. Well, I've

46:45.885 --> 46:47.168
just got other things I've got to do. But take your 
time.
