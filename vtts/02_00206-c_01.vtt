WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:30.645
the Senate was called on to act react to the design 
of things of a separate school and so on there was I

00:02.866 --> 00:30.645
think a little reaction to the Senate among other 
faculty members who would like a little more money

00:02.866 --> 00:30.645
to what was going to the Bush School by the 
legislature etc and not one can understand that I

00:02.866 --> 00:30.645
can sense that in the Senate meeting

00:33.815 --> 00:52.683
Are

00:33.815 --> 00:52.683
there any reactions that you can share that you 
heard about from President Bush and or other

00:33.815 --> 00:52.683
members of the Bush family as this proposal 
process is underway? No, I have no special hints.

00:58.992 --> 01:01.135
He's commented occasionally. It appeared to be a 
good proposal. And, of course, the famous story

01:03.903 --> 01:22.914
about either Louis Halbooty, I guess, who sent him 
the precinct by precinct election returns

01:03.903 --> 01:22.914
around Rice and around Houston and around here. I 
have a feeling that may have had as much to do with it

01:24.416 --> 01:31.007
as anything else. except it was a solid concrete 
proposal and there was no way he could go to Austin

01:32.152 --> 01:57.906
and where the hell else in Texas if you and Houston 
and Rice have got no land John Lindsay I asked John

01:32.152 --> 01:57.906
Lindsay one time when did he become aware that A&M 
was almost certainly the winner and he chuckled

01:32.152 --> 01:57.906
and said well most clearly I thought that when the 
head of the Rice proposal and the U of H proposal

01:58.308 --> 02:06.776
each came together to talk to me about... And see if 
we'd join. And see if we'd join in making it a

02:06.796 --> 02:09.038
three-way deal. He said, I thought we must be in 
pretty good shape at that point. In hindsight, can

02:14.403 --> 02:19.948
you think of anything that A&M might have done even 
better? They might have done better had they not

02:22.330 --> 02:27.775
put it as part of liberal arts. Oh. The school. Was 
there anything that came about as a result of that?

02:36.600 --> 02:37.501
Yes. The dean of liberal arts and political 
science. And the dean of liberal arts desperately

02:40.826 --> 02:44.312
wanted to hold on to it. He has got us involved with 
faculty from all over the university. As a result,

02:48.728 --> 02:55.663
the faculty structure, the course structure, the 
curriculum are absolute messes. Oh, okay. And we

02:58.108 --> 03:00.493
can't disengage easily. But now that separation 
of the Bush School As a unit reporting directly to

03:06.196 --> 03:10.760
the provost, that has now been done. That has been 
done as of last fall. And you think that's an

03:13.562 --> 03:15.364
appropriate decision? Yes. Is that? No, I think 
getting Herman out was a political act. I don't

03:24.672 --> 03:29.676
think the Bush family had anything to do with it. 
I'm trying to find out exactly how that

03:29.716 --> 03:35.241
legislative money was appropriated with an 
implication that if Herman stayed, they wouldn't

03:35.896 --> 03:41.662
get it. I think I'm reminded of a story of President 
Harding. He was visiting William Allen White on

03:48.008 --> 03:56.416
his way to the West Coast. And he was pacing the 
library in White's house, and suddenly Harding

03:57.677 --> 04:04.063
blurts out, My friends, my goddamn friends. I can 
take care of my enemies, but my goddamn friends.

04:12.504 --> 04:14.706
And I think this was friends of Bush. And Harding 
never said anymore and went on to Alaska and died.

04:18.809 --> 04:23.013
And you're implying self-appointed friends 
doing something. Doing what they thought would be

04:23.414 --> 04:25.876
a favor.

04:29.299 --> 04:29.679
Let's see. What have we left out?

04:36.848 --> 04:37.969
Oh, I don't know. I had some notes from what I've 
previously been involved in. Oh,

04:42.394 --> 04:57.308
one thing I've been glad to see at A&M is in the last 
few years they've done some indoctrination for

04:42.394 --> 04:57.308
new department heads. And it strikes me some deans 
ought to have done that. And you think that's a

05:01.292 --> 05:02.634
good... It sure as hell is. Now, I was out of public 
administration. There was no great mystery. I'd

05:09.068 --> 05:16.877
been involved with the school, which was in effect 
a small department, and all the decisions, et

05:09.068 --> 05:16.877
cetera. But I think of sociology, my

05:16.937 --> 05:33.957
sociology head, paralleling me, went over his 
budget, 10,000, because he didn't really quite

05:16.937 --> 05:33.957
understand what Though I haven't got the right 
term earmarking, you know, you make a commitment

05:34.713 --> 05:42.287
to spend, you don't have it. So he went over his 
budget 10,000 because he didn't encumber.

05:49.641 --> 05:57.075
What about an orientation session a day or so for 
all new faculty to learn more about the

05:49.641 --> 05:57.075
institution? Well, I used to do this and go over the 
rules and regulations, for example, as to what you

05:57.275 --> 06:13.172
could do and not do and what you jolly well better do 
if you don't want to trouble with complaints, etc.

06:15.134 --> 06:21.821
The year I had my ten new faculty, I came and said, 
Sam, just before you come in, I'm going to take them

06:15.134 --> 06:21.821
for a day. And we're going down. how you get started 
here. And one could have done a couple more days. I

06:32.379 --> 06:48.702
also had made it a practice to new faculty members 
get somebody to escort them to the first hill

06:32.379 --> 06:48.702
practice over in the field house. So things of that 
sort. I came here as a self-appointed critic of A&M

06:51.815 --> 07:02.829
because it was different than what my 
undergraduate school, little liberal arts

06:51.815 --> 07:02.829
school at Austin College and Rice. But I gradually 
became persuaded that A&M is distinctive and that

07:03.590 --> 07:11.119
each institution ought to be.

07:14.324 --> 07:18.649
What are the keys to understanding A&M?

07:23.050 --> 07:36.610
Well, oddly

07:23.050 --> 07:36.610
enough, the core is at the base of a lot of it, 
because the core has caused other people to

07:23.050 --> 07:36.610
organize also. Mm-hm. And I

07:37.872 --> 07:46.324
got this out of both sociology and the military 
that

07:49.223 --> 07:56.272
You become loyal to a large group because you have a 
small group of friends. You don't get loyalty to

07:56.292 --> 08:03.081
the large group in the abstract.

08:03.101 --> 08:04.583
Now I haven't been able to do that. I think I sold the 
general who was dean of students on fraternities

08:05.725 --> 08:16.699
in part by making that kind of point to him, and I 
think he understood it. because the army early in

08:17.000 --> 08:43.817
world war ii tried to abolish individual patches 
for individual units in a misguided notion that

08:17.000 --> 08:43.817
they were going to all think about one army and some 
few sociologists stouffer chicago and some

08:17.000 --> 08:43.817
others made the point look this ain't how it's done 
and they began to get from all over the military

08:17.000 --> 08:43.817
about inability to have their own units which 
isn't divisive except in a very limited way. And

08:48.226 --> 08:59.690
the army and military went hog wild over patches 
and distinctive items, names, et cetera, for

08:48.226 --> 08:59.690
units and so on. So the fraternities and 
sororities, the organizations, It's got an

09:06.258 --> 09:08.581
undergraduate organization. I think the MSC 
mechanism is very basic. People can find a place.

09:18.074 --> 09:19.576
There are all kinds there. And that's where it 
begins. Is A&M Spirit special? Yes. Now, Cornell

09:28.968 --> 09:31.291
had a great deal of Spirit. And I would say 
Dartmouth. also.

09:40.802 --> 09:49.173
But I think spirit also tends to be evidenced in 
proportion of people who make annual giving.

09:52.597 --> 09:53.959
There's a study of fraternities. The fraternity 
men,

09:54.059 --> 10:02.590
who are thought to be, you know, a lot of friends who 
think they're intellectual anti-college give

10:02.941 --> 10:12.050
more to their institutions in proportion than any 
other group. Are you aware there are now more

10:12.070 --> 10:16.495
fraternity and sorority members at A&M than there 
are members of the Corps? No, I wasn't. And there is

10:18.717 --> 10:26.625
a higher percentage, per capita percentage, 
undergraduate fraternity and sorority members

10:18.717 --> 10:26.625
here than at the University of Texas at Austin. Oh, 
no. I have been connected with our own chapter

10:27.786 --> 10:31.530
here. I was the young gentleman who was viewed as 
the founder of the first fraternity here was the

10:32.219 --> 10:41.169
guy who slept with the student.

10:45.054 --> 10:47.216
He and I became . And having been a National Officer 
of the fraternity, I helped him get his, I forget

10:47.757 --> 10:59.991
the name of his group, organized and with bylaws 
and such things. And then I helped one of the

11:00.091 --> 11:01.973
sororities. Likewise, Vi Burke was associated 
with one of the sororities, and when they got their

11:02.746 --> 11:19.732
charter, I gave the main talk at the banquet, I 
think.

11:19.752 --> 11:23.318
All right, I've got then two final questions. 
Let's make believe that someone gives you a check

11:24.419 --> 11:29.327
for a million dollars today. and there is only one 
requirement on that check, that you pass the money

11:30.522 --> 11:40.997
on to Texas A&M, but you choose the use that would be 
made for that gift. If you were doing something

11:42.359 --> 11:51.071
significant for Texas A&M, for what purpose would 
you want that generosity used?

11:57.259 --> 11:59.162
Oh, I don't know. I'm inclined to think

12:00.138 --> 12:12.291
I would give it to the president and tell him to use 
it wherever he thinks he needs it. That's very

12:12.311 --> 12:17.436
thoughtful.

12:21.641 --> 12:28.508
I would like to comment on two things I failed at.

12:31.694 --> 12:34.357
that I thought were damn good ideas and still do. 
Oh, do offer that. This is in the educational world

12:36.320 --> 12:44.069
for,

12:36.320 --> 12:44.069
well, there are two or three here. For some time, we 
had special sections in 206 and 207 for foreign

12:44.209 --> 12:53.400
students. I don't think they do anymore. I have no 
evidence of that. I thought this served a very

12:57.104 --> 13:00.148
useful purpose. And I, for example, had Kwong

13:00.314 --> 13:11.412
Ro, I had Marina Weiss, who was, Marina Weiss was 
interesting. She was, she neither looked it nor

13:11.552 --> 13:19.265
her name, but she was Puerto Rican and fluent in 
Spanish. As she told me, her custom was with an

13:20.106 --> 13:24.313
American government class to go in and function 
for a week in their perfect eastern English and

13:24.952 --> 13:39.425
then the second week she would start a little bit of 
Spanish and there would influence Spanish and

13:24.952 --> 13:39.425
there would be red faces all over the room.

13:44.110 --> 13:52.157
A woman in teaching us Mexicans and Puerto Ricans 
but Marina was very good So there, but that, you've

13:53.707 --> 13:59.776
got to have people to do it, but it was feasible. 
Then I began, and this was very interesting to do,

14:00.917 --> 14:21.267
and several people willing, Warren Dixon took the 
lead in

14:00.917 --> 14:21.267
what we called contract courses. A student could 
contract to do an A, B, or C.

14:23.238 --> 14:34.873
And this suited a lot of people. They didn't have, 
they had to do just what necessary to get a C, etc.

14:40.661 --> 14:48.190
And there was one lecture period a week for 
handling the things that needed to be done. But the

14:48.731 --> 14:51.034
reading was carefully chosen. And each week or 
each two weeks, there was an exam. Now you could

14:58.790 --> 15:01.314
come back and take the second thing. You could come 
back and take that exam several more times till you

15:01.334 --> 15:07.422
got it. But you could get your C, but you had to pass 
it. And now it meant a lot of initial work for the

15:14.592 --> 15:18.658
faculty. But those were very popular, 
particularly engineers who were desperate to get

15:19.938 --> 15:25.643
through. They knew exactly what they had to do. But 
it was very funny. Lebo, who was head of

15:34.070 --> 15:38.253
journalism, said, I'm not going to allow students 
to sign up for this. What the hell do you think

15:38.274 --> 15:39.434
you're doing? And a couple of my own faculty said, 
are you trying to do away with professors? Because

15:47.421 --> 15:49.523
this means a lot less lecturing. The faculty work 
with the A students who really can do it. And

15:58.546 --> 15:59.708
they're spending time. And you don't need half as 
many faculty. But I finally, this, when I left.

16:11.025 --> 16:12.006
Don't forget your lapel. We've got one more 
question. I could not get these. And also, this, of

16:17.014 --> 16:19.898
course, also involved program learning. which I 
thought was eminently sensible for heaven knows

16:20.992 --> 16:32.946
the state and local government, the 
constitutional part, a lot of it is working. Could

16:32.966 --> 16:35.789
never get them to really take hold. Last question. 
What feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas

16:39.613 --> 16:43.277
A&M today? Well, I've been delighted and enjoyed 
what I've done and been here. We expect to remain

16:50.320 --> 16:51.702
here. Dorothy's become accommodated to us. It 
took a year or two. And

16:57.129 --> 17:14.592
she'd been in high school, and I went to Harrison 
Hearth and she, and said she could teach

16:57.129 --> 17:14.592
composition, and A&M is expanding, you know, and 
has got to do composition throughout its years.

17:15.553 --> 17:19.298
And so they pick her up as a... a lecture, and she'd 
been here 20 years. I said, if I were her, I'll sue.

17:28.865 --> 17:36.892
But no, we've been delighted, and the place has 
grown, and it's a totally different place from

17:28.865 --> 17:36.892
what it was. I think, say, much of the 2020 is

17:36.972 --> 17:47.682
feasible

17:36.972 --> 17:47.682
if they'll unloose

17:49.973 --> 17:57.556
some of the administrative system occasionally 
and some money. That's great with that.
