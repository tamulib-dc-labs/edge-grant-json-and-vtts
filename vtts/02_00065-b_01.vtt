WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:11.179
11 Thursday afternoon, gray and cloudy outside and sitting in the living room with Jim Earl.

00:11.740 --> 00:17.971
And when we finished the first tape, we were talking about Cadet Slouch.

00:18.712 --> 00:24.502
And you said that you began Cadet Slouch when you were an undergraduate.

00:24.522 --> 00:28.249
Fall 1953 when I was a fourth year senior.

00:28.870 --> 00:32.095
And you said you modeled him after yourself.

00:34.319 --> 00:38.325
What led you to think about doing in the first place?

00:38.726 --> 00:40.729
You had played with that idea in high school?

00:41.811 --> 00:47.219
I had done drawings, and I did them in high school, but not cartoons where you had a caption or told a story.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.022
Just did pictures.

00:49.289 --> 00:55.597
and just decided I would try it and went over and they were receptive and I did it.

00:55.617 --> 00:59.842
Did you have any kind of inside track with the editor of the bat at that time?

00:59.862 --> 01:01.544
Didn't know anybody over there.

01:01.564 --> 01:16.022
And when you drew Cadet Slouch, what he looked like, did the Cadet Slouch that I would know ten years later look like the first?

01:16.610 --> 01:24.121
So when Cadet Slouch started, his hair was a little longer than it would be later?

01:24.481 --> 01:25.763
Yeah.

01:25.783 --> 01:28.266
And he started out as a member of the Corps.

01:28.286 --> 01:32.092
Oh yeah, that was mostly what A&M was then.

01:32.312 --> 01:34.275
And he always remained as a Corps member.

01:35.316 --> 01:42.887
Down through the years, where did you get your ideas and leads for the next cartoon?

01:43.998 --> 01:45.439
You know, that was hard.

01:45.459 --> 01:49.003
That's what cartooning is all about, is the next cartoon you're going to do.

01:50.204 --> 02:02.995
And I didn't have enough time to plan here to think it, but usually I could just sit down and say, I've got to come up with an idea, and I've got to do this cartoon, and I don't have much time, and just somehow get something out.

02:03.416 --> 02:06.338
And I feel like some of them are so doggone corny.

02:07.339 --> 02:08.740
You're under such pressure.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.785
Just get them out and get it over with, because the deadline is just every day hitting you like that.

02:14.153 --> 02:38.882
Sometimes if you can see an event on the campus, like one time they were pouring concrete at a Sully statue and they started as a statue and they had this sort of hub of a spokes of a wheel and then they laid the sidewalks in and the sidewalks came up and missed each other like that and they're supposed to join like that and they missed it about half the width of the sidewalk and there it is, man, just a cartoon.

02:38.902 --> 02:40.043
You say, here we are.

02:40.141 --> 02:44.567
These guys come this end and that end, and the sidewalks didn't join, and you can make a drawing of that.

02:46.489 --> 02:50.815
And when I walked past one time, somehow the contractor figured out who I was.

02:50.835 --> 02:55.942
I had a chance to gouge him a little bit and tease him about it.

02:57.304 --> 03:01.469
He enjoyed it, and that was the fun part of doing cartoons.

03:03.131 --> 03:07.397
I didn't try to do anything that was just scathing, take the hat off somebody, but just

03:08.390 --> 03:14.535
Show what happens, and somebody walks past and says, there's that damn thing there, and it just all sort of ties together.

03:14.575 --> 03:19.620
That's the best cartoon for a small, regional audience like this.

03:19.760 --> 03:25.765
Did you have a notepad or anything when you'd see something or think of something?

03:26.946 --> 03:28.588
All right, you just followed away upstairs.

03:29.108 --> 03:34.273
You normally tried to have how many in advance done?

03:34.353 --> 03:34.673
In advance?

03:34.693 --> 03:37.556
What is this advance?

03:37.576 --> 03:38.076
You do them.

03:38.528 --> 03:44.414
I did at one time rather have two or three in advance, but most of the time I just barely make the deadlines.

03:44.434 --> 03:46.356
And how many a week normally?

03:46.676 --> 03:54.744
Back then I think it was four a week, and then shortly thereafter we went to five a week.

03:55.405 --> 03:57.166
Except it didn't have them on Saturday or Sunday.

03:57.867 --> 04:00.109
So you started in 1953.

04:00.890 --> 04:03.793
Yeah, I went through about 19.

04:04.432 --> 04:05.854
85, I think it was.

04:06.294 --> 04:07.035
Alright.

04:07.155 --> 04:09.418
Now, are you away at all during that time?

04:10.439 --> 04:11.801
No, I was here all during that time.

04:11.821 --> 04:12.682
Well, let's see.

04:12.702 --> 04:15.124
I was in the Air Force two years and mailed cartoons back.

04:15.265 --> 04:16.686
Oh, you mailed cartoons back?

04:17.027 --> 04:17.167
Yeah.

04:17.307 --> 04:18.248
During those two years?

04:18.448 --> 04:18.588
Yeah.

04:18.909 --> 04:19.770
Oh, how splendid.

04:21.772 --> 04:29.982
Did you ever have anybody in any kind of authority, either student or otherwise, to complain?

04:30.302 --> 04:31.063
Never, nobody.

04:32.225 --> 04:42.019
Did some examples, you mentioned the contractor, examples of where people took note pleasantly, positively?

04:43.180 --> 04:50.130
Did any person in authority ever commend you for it?

04:51.532 --> 04:55.077
Only from the standpoint of sort of wanting to be included, unfortunately.

04:55.647 --> 04:56.369
Examples?

04:56.389 --> 04:57.551
Can you give any examples?

04:57.752 --> 05:01.219
Well, I had an English teacher named Shepard, you might remember him, J.N.

05:01.260 --> 05:08.877
Shepard, and he wasn't being there, and that was sort of a highlight to him to be featured in a cartoon.

05:08.897 --> 05:11.422
Did you include Mr. Rudder in a cartoon ever?

05:12.164 --> 05:14.449
It seemed like I might have, but it...

05:15.290 --> 05:21.819
Some of those things I did were sort of honorary things where you feature somebody and have a little bit of a write-up about them that was sort of an official cartoon.

05:21.879 --> 05:34.196
And I did a lot of those retirement things, too, where people retire and I would do a cartoon for them that sort of featured their retirement, maybe, you know, so long, good luck, and listed something about their background.

05:34.857 --> 05:37.261
But those weren't published as such.

05:37.862 --> 05:44.571
But I don't know if I did much on, maybe I didn't on Rudder except that type of cartoon.

05:46.120 --> 05:52.906
When I was a student, you know, I was a little bit more of a kid type and did more of an individual sort of stuff than I did later on.

05:53.807 --> 05:58.051
As you look back on it, are there some of which you were most proud?

05:59.072 --> 06:05.578
Sure, a lot of them I liked better than others, but if you're going to ask me which ones there were, I couldn't come up with them now.

06:06.459 --> 06:10.382
Alright, and there was no one then that were you sitting there?

06:10.402 --> 06:12.464
It was just like sausage, it just kept coming out.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.587
Alright, why did you cease?

06:17.474 --> 06:21.499
I'm not sure there was a reason.

06:21.559 --> 06:25.784
I just sort of got to where I did them with a little bit less regularity.

06:26.585 --> 06:32.072
And I was so stretched out doing all these doggone textbooks and stuff.

06:32.092 --> 06:36.197
And I guess I just sort of got tired and sort of quit it.

06:36.217 --> 06:38.800
And no one ever said, hey, where's the cartoons?

06:38.820 --> 06:39.982
I said, no one gives a damn.

06:40.002 --> 06:42.084
Why should I?

06:42.525 --> 06:46.570
And so you worked with all kinds of battalion editors and

06:47.039 --> 06:47.880
and so forth.

06:48.221 --> 06:50.525
Did any editor ever try to edit one?

06:52.548 --> 06:53.049
Reword?

06:53.069 --> 06:56.415
I don't think so, no.

06:56.435 --> 07:02.926
And you never were called on the carpet for bad language, bad... Never used any, no.

07:02.986 --> 07:07.253
So you never were in any kind of hot water with them?

07:07.634 --> 07:08.295
Tried to.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.460
Have a little bit of a message where

07:12.014 --> 07:18.220
if you do this, this is what happens sort of thing, where it's sort of easy, some yo-yo trying to figure out some shortcut to making a grade.

07:19.201 --> 07:26.247
You can understand the simplest way to do it is the only way to do it, and that's the young study of it, as opposed to having all these systems worked out.

07:26.267 --> 07:31.972
All right, if someone were to say, what was the philosophy behind Cadet Slouch, how would you?

07:34.174 --> 07:37.257
Just pretty much to mirror what's happening on the campus.

07:37.277 --> 07:40.300
Not just among the Corps members, although Slouch wore a uniform,

07:40.651 --> 07:45.416
What was happening on the campus that mostly was portrayed there is what happened among the whole student body.

07:46.677 --> 07:48.899
And you were not trying to parody it.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.423
You were trying to reflect accurately.

07:52.663 --> 07:55.886
Yes, show what's happening on the campus and have some fun with it.

07:55.906 --> 08:00.972
Alright, did Cadet Slouch take note of co-eds when they enrolled?

08:00.992 --> 08:02.473
Oh yeah, sure.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.756
Did you have racial diversity?

08:06.157 --> 08:07.418
Never got to that point.

08:09.035 --> 08:14.465
But we didn't have very many minorities, I guess, at that time, been on any of it anyway.

08:14.846 --> 08:20.716
He didn't have any, he didn't use any bad language in the lingo.

08:21.778 --> 08:24.884
And he was always, Slouch was always a Corps member.

08:25.084 --> 08:31.015
Once in a while do something like a t-shirt with an advertisement like Precration Nation or something like that.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.578
Or once in a while you have a

08:33.385 --> 08:35.648
have some sort of a cartoon talking about Thespians.

08:37.411 --> 08:41.997
That's profaned up most people on campus.

08:43.078 --> 08:46.503
So once you're back, did you do them in the summer also?

08:47.324 --> 08:51.270
Yeah, they had about one or two issues during the summer only.

08:51.610 --> 08:55.595
So by and large it was done.

08:55.756 --> 09:01.143
How many different book volumes of Cadet Slouch cartoons have been published?

09:01.283 --> 09:02.565
Published four.

09:03.052 --> 09:05.015
Are any of them still in print?

09:05.595 --> 09:05.736
No.

09:08.439 --> 09:09.741
There ought to be one grand one.

09:09.761 --> 09:12.805
Oh, I would like to do one.

09:12.865 --> 09:24.201
I've been thinking about going over there, but everybody is, you know, from the moon, and that's what I call it, the Yankee type people that come way out there, and they wouldn't have any appreciation of what I'm talking about.

09:24.261 --> 09:28.707
If I went to A&M Press right now, they'd say, well, we'll be in touch with you.

09:28.767 --> 09:29.348
Don't call us.

09:29.388 --> 09:32.552
We'll call you sort of thing, I bet you.

09:32.870 --> 09:35.512
All right, let's go back then to your as a student day.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.335
You graduated in what year?

09:38.355 --> 09:39.496
55.

09:41.277 --> 09:43.519
Describe commencement in 1955.

09:43.539 --> 09:47.222
1955.

09:47.442 --> 09:51.506
Commencement, we had commissioning exercises.

09:51.526 --> 10:00.293
I guess we had commissioning exercises, final review, and that night we had graduation for people.

10:00.353 --> 10:02.455
Where were all those held?

10:03.093 --> 10:10.743
At G. Riley White, when both ceremonies took place in that building, and of course on the front of the MSC is where the drill field was, that's where Final Reviews held.

10:10.763 --> 10:19.814
So you get commissioned in the afternoon about 1 o'clock, Final Reviews about 3 o'clock, and at night you have your graduation exercises.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.817
So it was just like that.

10:22.338 --> 10:29.607
And strange as it may be, showing you the beauty of the military, we were all in the Air Force.

10:30.970 --> 10:45.326
I don't know if I told you this not earlier, but anyway, for the tape-offs to tell, again, we were all in the Air Force at the end of our junior year, our third year, and we'd signed commissions, contracts for commissions, and that was all agreed with the wonderful country of the United States of America.

10:45.346 --> 10:54.156
And we went to the summer camp, and I know they sent an article from a local paper in Jacksonville that no one would get the commissions in the Air Force unless they flew.

10:54.176 --> 10:57.940
So your contracts were all known void unless you flew.

10:58.780 --> 11:03.046
And I posted on the bullet board out in Roslyn, Mexico, in summer camp that summer.

11:03.066 --> 11:04.448
People noticed them for long enough.

11:04.468 --> 11:05.630
People got interested in it.

11:05.650 --> 11:08.014
They got a bunch of officers around there and said, tell us about it.

11:08.034 --> 11:11.138
And they got us all in a great big area somewhere and got up.

11:11.158 --> 11:13.562
Yeah, well, yeah, that's right and so forth.

11:13.582 --> 11:16.526
So the SOBs never would tell me I was going to get a commission.

11:16.866 --> 11:19.450
Because I said, hell, I don't want to fly because that's four years.

11:20.332 --> 11:21.373
I want to be a civilian.

11:21.393 --> 11:21.974
I'll give you two.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.618
But there's no point in me flying and taking up your money in the spot.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.162
They said, well, you won't get a commission.

11:27.222 --> 11:28.163
Well, OK, fine.

11:28.649 --> 11:34.176
I didn't know until about two days before commissioning that I'd get a commission.

11:34.196 --> 11:36.038
They never would come out and tell me something.

11:36.058 --> 11:38.060
One of my buddies would say, hey, your name's on this.

11:38.861 --> 11:39.342
What this?

11:39.482 --> 11:41.765
I was ready to go in there as an airman.

11:41.785 --> 11:45.509
So I finally had my name listed.

11:45.910 --> 11:49.694
And since then, I really haven't had it due to the military.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.458
I had a signed contract and all that.

11:52.498 --> 11:55.281
But two days before commissioning, I got my commission.

11:55.784 --> 12:03.012
So that day, that all took place, finally commissioning, and that wrapped up AM for me.

12:03.032 --> 12:04.955
I thought I was going to go home.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.097
He threw with AM, had two flat tires on my way home.

12:08.439 --> 12:09.600
Never had that one before.

12:10.241 --> 12:16.348
Who came, for you, who was in the audience at those events?

12:16.829 --> 12:18.050
My brother finished high school.

12:18.070 --> 12:18.911
My dad stayed with him.

12:18.951 --> 12:21.194
My mother came down for me to graduate.

12:21.214 --> 12:22.315
Anybody else?

12:22.902 --> 12:28.572
Now, let's see, were you the first in the family to go to college?

12:28.592 --> 12:34.743
And at that point, what were you thinking you were going to do professionally?

12:34.783 --> 12:38.709
Well, I wanted to be a cartoonist, but I said I would probably end up being an architect.

12:40.012 --> 12:43.698
You were thinking of a comparatively traditional architect?

12:43.718 --> 12:44.860
Yeah.

12:45.008 --> 12:48.513
The commencement, describe commencement.

12:48.773 --> 12:50.856
How many and so forth?

12:50.876 --> 12:53.580
Well, I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a number just guessing.

12:53.620 --> 12:56.524
I think it'd be 1,200, 1,500 maybe.

12:56.544 --> 12:59.768
And we'd all walk across stage one at a time and shook hands with the president.

12:59.788 --> 13:00.609
G. Raleigh was filled.

13:00.649 --> 13:01.490
G. Raleigh, yeah.

13:01.831 --> 13:03.193
Do you remember who the speaker was?

13:03.273 --> 13:04.254
Of course not.

13:04.835 --> 13:06.277
You don't remember either commissioning or?

13:06.557 --> 13:06.698
No.

13:07.719 --> 13:14.408
Were there any dignitaries, world-famous people that came to A&M while you were a student?

13:16.936 --> 13:20.420
I think that Eisenhower for sure came.

13:21.402 --> 13:26.748
I don't know if Bradley did or not, but Eisenhower did come.

13:26.888 --> 13:31.294
I'm sure a lot of them came that I didn't know about.

13:31.314 --> 13:32.395
Did he come by train?

13:32.415 --> 13:34.418
I don't know how he got here.

13:36.040 --> 13:40.345
Because there wasn't any airline service, scheduled airline service, was there?

13:41.152 --> 13:42.273
Was Easterwood even?

13:42.293 --> 13:46.417
I think that's about time he was making his run for the president.

13:46.617 --> 13:50.020
Did Easterwood exist even when you were a student?

13:50.780 --> 13:52.582
Or was there old Coulter Field?

13:52.602 --> 13:53.743
There was Coulter Field.

13:53.763 --> 13:57.386
I think Easterwood did exist.

13:57.406 --> 14:00.429
But I think it operated about like Coulter Field.

14:00.449 --> 14:01.930
And the university might have some plans.

14:02.030 --> 14:05.713
I think it had no commercial plans.

14:05.733 --> 14:06.254
It did.

14:06.274 --> 14:07.995
I didn't know about them.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.197
I would never dream of flying anywhere.

14:10.835 --> 14:15.121
What were the feelings of you and your mother?

14:17.605 --> 14:22.953
Did y'all have any special conversation on the way home from commencement?

14:22.993 --> 14:26.858
I was just so grateful to have that behind me.

14:26.958 --> 14:30.944
Going A&M for me was a hard job.

14:30.964 --> 14:32.326
It wasn't fun and games at all.

14:32.346 --> 14:33.488
It was a hard job.

14:33.508 --> 14:39.036
There was a lot that you can enjoy even if you're in a prison camp like Stalag 17.

14:39.708 --> 14:49.162
But it was a hard job, and all of us pretty much finished on time, and we did so much more than the average student today does that it would work.

14:49.883 --> 14:55.432
And we went home and came back over a weekend or some vacation break or something.

14:55.452 --> 14:59.097
Man, that last 40 miles coming to College Station was a grim experience.

14:59.117 --> 15:02.583
We didn't look forward to coming back and getting into that way of life that we were in.

15:04.045 --> 15:06.108
I don't think I asked you this earlier.

15:06.468 --> 15:06.829
If we could

15:07.096 --> 15:17.767
get all the teachers that you had here today, which ones would you want to give special appreciation to?

15:19.009 --> 15:36.107
I told you I'm appreciative of all the people who I've rubbed shoulders with throughout my career and as you know and as with your experiences, most people you run into at the university level are good people, decent people.

15:36.627 --> 15:48.338
Some are more talented than others, but as far as someone who turned the key in the lock that I was floating at sea and had no idea where I was, and this person came up and put me back on track and guided me somewhere, there was never a situation like that.

15:48.898 --> 15:53.463
I was never in that kind of situation or did that I need someone to do that.

15:53.883 --> 16:01.170
So I don't have any inspirational story to tell you in that regard, but I am appreciative of every little thing that teachers did.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.512
Did A&M change you much?

16:03.593 --> 16:06.315
in your attitudes, ideas, philosophy?

16:06.335 --> 16:07.656
I think I was ready and made for A&M.

16:07.736 --> 16:12.500
I had sort of the mentality of A&M sort of when I came down here, because you have to.

16:13.561 --> 16:18.005
Who in the world won't come down here and get in this tough environment?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.887
And it was a tough environment.

16:20.007 --> 16:23.109
It was tough in every regard you can think of.

16:23.730 --> 16:27.533
And you have to be sort of a combative type of personality to fit in best.

16:27.553 --> 16:30.976
But yeah, I think it molded me, made me probably more that way.

16:31.396 --> 16:33.398
All right, so you go on active duty.

16:34.812 --> 16:36.474
Soon after graduation?

16:36.934 --> 16:38.096
No, I had the summer off.

16:38.116 --> 16:40.198
I didn't go until September.

16:40.218 --> 16:40.418
All right.

16:40.438 --> 16:42.460
And where did you serve?

16:42.480 --> 16:47.266
I went to Abilene, Texas, a new base under construction.

16:47.286 --> 16:51.671
No pay roads going to it, about 7,500 people there.

16:51.691 --> 16:58.658
And that thing, by the time I left, it blossomed out and become a full-fledged strategic bomber base.

16:58.899 --> 16:59.800
Were you there two years?

17:00.220 --> 17:00.981
Two years.

17:01.241 --> 17:02.943
And what duties did you have?

17:02.963 --> 17:04.785
Well, I started off...

17:05.322 --> 17:16.543
as an installation officer with the installation squadron, and I held every undesirable position that that squadron had as a lieutenant.

17:17.384 --> 17:25.339
I was in charge of morale, getting security clearances for 300 guys and safety officers, blah, blah, blah, blah.

17:25.379 --> 17:26.541
I was signed out for a while.

17:26.641 --> 17:29.406
Every building on the whole base was in my name.

17:29.740 --> 17:34.987
And I'd been in the service, you know, 15 minutes, and hearing all that stuff dumps on you.

17:35.007 --> 17:40.275
I ended up coming to General Zade and said, see you fellas.

17:40.335 --> 17:48.426
And I left those guys in the installations and went up to the General, not Westmoreland, but Westover.

17:49.768 --> 17:51.130
And that was real nice.

17:51.150 --> 17:53.453
He was a nice fellow, and I enjoyed working with him.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.968
Did you spend two years there?

17:57.328 --> 17:57.668
Two years.

17:57.969 --> 18:01.732
Alright, and did you come back to A&M after that?

18:01.792 --> 18:02.613
Yeah.

18:02.633 --> 18:06.717
Alright, how did you and A&M get hooked up then?

18:07.377 --> 18:08.558
Do you ever know Conrad Webb?

18:09.299 --> 18:11.141
No.

18:11.161 --> 18:15.605
He and another guy used to do these halftime flips and clown suits at basketball games.

18:16.426 --> 18:16.566
Mm-hmm.

18:16.586 --> 18:16.966
Remember that?

18:17.146 --> 18:17.286
Mm-hmm.

18:17.667 --> 18:22.191
One of the guys worked at the department for a cross-eyed guy that was real good at tumbling.

18:22.610 --> 18:27.459
Webb was a, I knew him, we were athletes together.

18:28.682 --> 18:33.050
And I ran into him, I came down to him to do something, and I ran into him.

18:33.070 --> 18:33.651
He said, what you doing?

18:33.671 --> 18:36.256
He said, I'm teaching this stuff over here.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.098
And I said, what is that?

18:38.240 --> 18:40.645
And the architects didn't go through this program here.

18:42.248 --> 18:44.432
The engineers go through that.

18:44.986 --> 18:47.970
He explained that to me, and I said, and you're teaching.

18:48.010 --> 18:49.432
Tell me about it.

18:49.452 --> 18:51.374
He said, well, you ought to apply.

18:51.394 --> 18:54.218
They always need somebody, and I won't be leaving and so forth and so on.

18:54.238 --> 18:57.442
I said, gee, give me the address, and I'll send a letter down.

18:57.542 --> 18:59.164
And sure enough, I got a reply back.

19:00.486 --> 19:05.272
Got an offer for something like $3,900 for nine months.

19:05.973 --> 19:10.519
And finally, they sent me another letter back and said, we're going to give you a raise, and we're going to give you $4,000.

19:10.619 --> 19:11.701
I still have the letter out here.

19:12.221 --> 19:13.423
$4,000 appointment.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.232
to go to AM for nine months.

19:15.252 --> 19:16.213
And this is 1957?

19:16.233 --> 19:18.455
Seven, yeah.

19:18.716 --> 19:19.957
Seven.

19:20.338 --> 19:25.003
And what was your professorial title?

19:25.023 --> 19:25.504
Of course.

19:25.804 --> 19:27.646
The same one everyone started with, instructor.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.249
You were an instructor of engineering graphics?

19:30.590 --> 19:31.711
Yeah.

19:31.871 --> 19:36.036
Describe the department at that time, didn't you?

19:36.056 --> 19:41.082
That we had classes that were, do you remember out there with the old

19:42.563 --> 19:50.355
where the TV studio is now, they had some 10 buildings, 10 root buildings called Anchor Hall.

19:50.435 --> 20:00.510
Had about three of those buildings jammed together, and we had classes also in the Coliseum around the perimeter, G. Raleigh White Coliseum.

20:00.530 --> 20:03.073
We had about four rooms there.

20:03.094 --> 20:06.799
So we were in that so-called temporary facility like so many.

20:07.319 --> 20:14.548
over there had a bunch of buildings of that same caliber on at the North Gate level and they taught all kinds of courses over there as well, temporarily.

20:15.589 --> 20:32.549
So that was the program and I guess we had about 15, 16 faculty members and I guess we had maybe somewhere close to eight or nine hundred students per semester.

20:32.589 --> 20:34.792
Did every engineering student go through?

20:34.992 --> 20:37.275
Right, it was a service program at all.

20:38.099 --> 20:41.885
who was the chairman of the department?

20:41.925 --> 20:42.505
W.E.

20:42.566 --> 20:43.707
Street.

20:43.727 --> 20:44.328
Street.

20:44.348 --> 20:45.470
S-T-R-E-E-T?

20:45.790 --> 20:46.211
Yeah.

20:46.231 --> 20:48.494
Describe him.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.678
He was of the old school.

20:50.698 --> 21:04.458
He was a very gentlemanly type fella that was formal in all respects and he was very active in church and just straight as an era, so straight he could hardly catch a joke.

21:04.478 --> 21:06.621
He just was one of those kind of guys

21:07.445 --> 21:17.915
That was a stoic, directed individual that was humorless, I guess, but he was a decent guy.

21:17.936 --> 21:20.418
And there were a lot of fellows like Ed Aiden at the time.

21:20.478 --> 21:37.435
I could just make a half dozen that sort of fit that mode, where they were just real professional, staunch, non-wavering type individuals that never could dance on both sides of the fence or have a good time or let themselves go any

21:37.752 --> 21:47.726
But he was a real decent guy, and he hired me, and I always had frustration with him and a lot of respect for him, and appreciated him greatly.

21:48.928 --> 21:56.439
As far as you know, did anybody intervene in your behalf or speak in your behalf to help you get that first job?

21:56.559 --> 21:57.140
Oh, hell no.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.064
It's just like throwing a dart at the board.

22:00.324 --> 22:01.846
I never planned to be an academic.

22:01.927 --> 22:04.350
If I had, I'd have been a little bit differently prepared.

22:05.022 --> 22:13.690
Did you have any kind of orientation or advice on how to be a faculty member from anyone?

22:13.730 --> 22:17.153
Yeah, I was required to audit somebody's class before I taught mine.

22:18.514 --> 22:20.916
And that was a good policy and a good rule.

22:20.996 --> 22:26.321
And when it was my time to advise people what to do or direct them what to do, that's what we did.

22:26.661 --> 22:31.105
We said, you go with this senior guy and watch how he does it and you try to do it at least that good.

22:31.245 --> 22:33.527
If you can do it better, that's even nicer.

22:33.794 --> 22:36.698
Who were the senior colleagues that you most admired?

22:39.241 --> 22:41.063
In that particular program?

22:41.083 --> 22:42.345
Any of them?

22:42.525 --> 22:43.667
Particularly in that program?

22:44.087 --> 22:45.529
Particularly in that program.

22:45.549 --> 22:48.613
Well, we had a number of them.

22:48.633 --> 22:53.640
A sort of contemporary of mine was old North Bardell, who later became city manager over at College Station, and he was there.

22:54.641 --> 22:57.925
Another nice guy I knew of, Gene McGarrah.

22:57.945 --> 22:59.447
He was a Naval Academy.

23:00.592 --> 23:04.756
and he ended up at TI and still lives in Dallas, I think.

23:04.776 --> 23:06.077
And they were contemporaries.

23:07.118 --> 23:08.880
And I admire Street.

23:08.940 --> 23:13.004
Samuel Cleland was the one that I thought a great deal of.

23:13.024 --> 23:15.567
And John Oliver.

23:19.410 --> 23:23.074
And Ed, not Wayne, but Ed Stark, Lawrence E. Stark.

23:24.055 --> 23:30.261
He is a father-in-law of Jim Sheeter, worked for his association.

23:31.034 --> 23:34.818
When you first began, who was dean of engineering?

23:34.838 --> 23:44.728
I think Calhoun was for a few minutes, and then he got named vice president, something like that.

23:44.748 --> 23:58.101
We didn't have chancellor, that kind of thing, but I think he became vice president for the university, and Benson became dean, and he remained dean through about, oh, I guess maybe 1980 or something like that.

23:58.781 --> 24:00.383
Make believe that I didn't know

24:00.683 --> 24:01.384
Fred Benson.

24:01.484 --> 24:02.346
Tell me about him.

24:03.567 --> 24:07.814
Fred Benson was the most unique individual I think I've ever known.

24:07.914 --> 24:12.621
He's a highly talented, strictly business.

24:13.142 --> 24:22.336
He had a mannerism about him to cut out as much superfluous discussion as anybody I've ever known.

24:22.797 --> 24:26.623
If you went to see Fred Benson and pull up a chair and sit down at his place,

24:27.363 --> 24:32.552
He looked across the desk and had that old steel blue eyes and he just looked a hole through you and said, well, get on with it.

24:32.572 --> 24:32.953
What is it?

24:32.973 --> 24:33.734
What are we going to do here?

24:34.696 --> 24:43.491
And if you're there just to visit with him, it takes a while for that to sort of settle down because he has that mannerism that repels anyone wasting his time.

24:44.393 --> 24:50.063
And if you want to talk to him about something and get something from him, you realize right quick that you don't have it.

24:50.768 --> 25:01.058
documented exactly the way it needs to be and it established that beyond doubt you truly need it and he ought to give it to you, you weren't going anywhere.

25:01.558 --> 25:09.986
But if you could establish that with him, that by golly we got something busted down, we need some money to replace it, he would always come through.

25:10.006 --> 25:14.850
But he always begrudged getting involved in anything that was unnecessary.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.653
Best anecdote, I remember some guy,

25:18.427 --> 25:19.929
who was head of ME department at that time.

25:19.969 --> 25:20.851
His name's not in the department.

25:20.871 --> 25:22.093
I know him, but his name's not in the department.

25:22.113 --> 25:23.815
He told me the story.

25:23.835 --> 25:26.018
He said, I went in to see Benson and sat down.

25:26.058 --> 25:31.246
He says, hey, I'm thinking about those so-and-so and maybe you're sending him over here to do such and such.

25:31.266 --> 25:32.909
He says, what do you think I'll do about that?

25:34.071 --> 25:38.677
And he just said, well, Dr. Blanky Blank, I can handle that problem for you if you want me to.

25:41.021 --> 25:44.767
And he said, well, I think I can do it all right.

25:44.807 --> 25:47.050
And it got off my lip, but that was Benson Blanky.

25:47.502 --> 25:48.583
But he knew the budget.

25:49.424 --> 25:50.625
He knew what people were making.

25:51.106 --> 25:54.510
Right now, there's not a department head on the campus that knows what their own budget looks like.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.993
But he knew the College of Engineering payroll pretty well.

25:58.514 --> 25:59.074
I've seen him.

25:59.175 --> 26:03.319
I've seen guys get up to these computer printout forms and go through all this stuff.

26:03.379 --> 26:04.340
And he said, hell, that's wrong.

26:04.380 --> 26:08.164
He could go through and add it up in his head faster than people can go through with an adding machine.

26:08.845 --> 26:15.332
But he was a highly talented, no-nonsense person who made many contributions

26:15.802 --> 26:19.968
this university, and I've never seen, I don't know how he did it.

26:19.988 --> 26:27.759
He could get in any group and stand up and just say things that the rest of us couldn't get by with, but he could, because he was just that blunt and that straightforward.

26:27.779 --> 26:33.266
Now, what do you think was his perception of what Texas A&M's engineering program should be?

26:37.492 --> 26:43.260
Now, getting in his head is a little bit difficult, but I think he felt great pride for A&M's heritage.

26:43.983 --> 26:47.207
And looking through the industry and seeing all the people in the positions that they're in.

26:47.407 --> 26:50.390
And his idea was, let's keep this thing at least that good.

26:50.851 --> 26:52.092
Let's don't experiment.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.934
Let's don't take our brain out and fiddle with it.

26:53.954 --> 26:55.897
Let's keep it on track.

26:56.417 --> 26:57.979
Let's keep it at least as good.

26:58.019 --> 26:59.501
Let's have continuity.

27:01.083 --> 27:04.026
Let's have people in position who can do a good job.

27:04.867 --> 27:07.510
And let's just do it more and longer and better.

27:08.198 --> 27:10.901
He wasn't experimental, where he said, hey, I've got a keen idea.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.264
Let's run a bar and put on a show and do it Mickey Ring style.

27:13.284 --> 27:16.128
He said, no, we're going to go down the road and do it the way it ought to be done.

27:17.069 --> 27:31.107
Did you have any kind of instruction directly or by inference of any of the rules for a faculty member, things you were not to do?

27:31.127 --> 27:31.988
From him, no.

27:32.008 --> 27:33.811
Or from anybody?

27:33.831 --> 27:34.071
No.

27:35.587 --> 27:39.232
Nobody told you that you should not?

27:39.252 --> 27:39.993
Well, I'll take it back.

27:40.013 --> 27:43.277
You know, the street would say, now, you're going to have students come in.

27:43.317 --> 27:49.205
They're going to want to take off a day early or something like that when it gets to the time of the year and that sort of.

27:49.225 --> 27:53.370
And the best thing to do is just hold the line, just college regulation for success and that sort of thing.

27:53.391 --> 27:57.736
But two hadn't been told that, but a few faculty members adhere to that.

27:57.796 --> 27:59.839
They think they ought to get to run their own show.

28:00.427 --> 28:04.632
You know, like Cokes in the room, I always say we've got signs on up there that says no Cokes in the room.

28:04.933 --> 28:10.380
You know, we've got that sign, that's college regulation, let's don't do it.

28:10.600 --> 28:27.582
In terms of private life, were there any understood rules or guidelines about faculty members away from the campus?

28:29.300 --> 28:31.102
I don't think so, Haskin.

28:32.643 --> 28:36.467
Did anybody ever have students over at their home and serve them alcohol?

28:37.168 --> 28:39.130
Oh, no.

28:39.310 --> 28:39.991
What did you wear?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.333
How did you dress to go to class?

28:43.574 --> 28:50.120
Usually when it was hot when I first started out, I wore a shirt and a tie and slacks.

28:51.021 --> 28:55.786
Always, when the weather permitted, I wore a coat in addition to that.

28:56.166 --> 28:57.788
Did anybody tell you to do that?

28:58.443 --> 29:00.526
but that was pretty well what everybody was doing.

29:01.508 --> 29:04.773
The guys that held positions of respect did.

29:06.014 --> 29:09.740
So it's like impersonating a hobo or a winner.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.343
What you saw was a role model.

29:11.363 --> 29:15.349
It's just, I'd rather be like him than out here in the street with a wine bottle.

29:15.689 --> 29:19.415
When you came, where did you live as a faculty member?

29:19.435 --> 29:23.701
When I first came here, Chris and I... You're married by that time?

29:24.022 --> 29:26.205
Yeah, we lived in one of Gronland's little...

29:26.692 --> 29:44.054
rental places on Welch Street and then that first summer I left went home to work and I came back with a little bitty cubby hole place on Ayrshire and then I think about the next summer we bought a place on Fidelity Street.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.957
Do you remember what the rent was the first place or two?

29:47.117 --> 29:48.639
Something like $75 I think.

29:50.201 --> 29:51.703
And did you all have furniture by then?

29:53.827 --> 29:56.772
I don't think so.

29:56.792 --> 29:57.373
It might have been furnished.

29:57.393 --> 29:57.593
Okay.

29:59.036 --> 30:03.323
And what was your teaching load when you began?

30:04.404 --> 30:07.409
Four sections and we met six.

30:07.790 --> 30:09.052
Contact 24 hours away.

30:10.434 --> 30:10.554
Great.

30:10.574 --> 30:19.429
And what, I ask this out of complete ignorance, what would be the, what did you, what homework did you get from them to grade?

30:20.422 --> 30:36.996
We had problem manuals and we would remove a page and some of them are freehand and some of them you have to take them down and solve problems and geometry problems and dimension parts and do some design work.

30:37.178 --> 30:39.461
Even later on, we worked on some vellum.

30:39.482 --> 30:44.409
We'd take it through the blueprint machine, make blueprints of the drawings and state them all together.

30:45.431 --> 30:48.075
A lot like engineers would do drawings to build for them.

30:48.095 --> 30:49.717
Did you mark these with a red pencil?

30:51.199 --> 30:53.002
And then they took tests.

30:53.683 --> 30:55.626
How many per semester normally?

30:56.045 --> 31:00.208
And at that time, I think we took about four tests during the semester.

31:00.228 --> 31:01.470
And a final exam?

31:01.490 --> 31:03.211
Did not have a final exam.

31:03.231 --> 31:04.252
These were all freshmen?

31:04.552 --> 31:05.313
Freshmen.

31:05.333 --> 31:08.796
Well, not necessarily, but most of them meant to be a beginning course.

31:08.816 --> 31:09.416
All right.

31:09.436 --> 31:16.302
And as the years went on, what would your teaching assignments, how would they fit?

31:16.322 --> 31:18.984
Still remained about at that level.

31:19.004 --> 31:25.950
And the tests went from four tests, which seemed to be a great big fat test that took up

31:26.487 --> 31:32.784
big chunk of time what we did that we made weekly tests and we had something like 15 of them, one a week.

31:32.804 --> 31:39.282
So they were shorter to grade but it made the students keep up rather than trying to put off studying the crown for this picture.
