WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:04.485
They worked well together. And then when she got, I 
believe it was Dr. Williams, she called me and

00:04.565 --> 00:11.434
said, I just don't think I can work for him. And I 
said, yes, you can. You can work for anybody. She

00:14.398 --> 00:17.401
didn't know him that well, and she was just out of 
her element. So, of course, it worked out

00:18.022 --> 00:20.005
beautifully. I think he sent her a dozen roses, and 
I think he realized she was having time adjusting

00:20.345 --> 00:32.080
too, but it all worked out really well. Describe 
Dr. Williams as you remember him. Well, of course,

00:35.637 --> 00:41.604
I didn't have a lot of connection with him, so I 
can't really comment on it, so I don't really know.

00:41.624 --> 00:44.147
What do you think was the general campus 
impression of him? I don't know. Oh, you don't? I'm

00:46.991 --> 00:48.533
sorry, I really don't. We had all we could handle in 
the graduate college, and I really didn't. Do you

00:53.799 --> 00:57.263
know what the student nickname for him was? No. 
Smiling Jack. Oh, well. Because he was always

01:00.393 --> 01:01.675
upbeat. Yeah. Okay. No, I really have no... Not 
long after Dr. Williams got here, he appointed

01:03.197 --> 01:09.125
John Calhoun as the vice president. Dr. Coonsey 
remained as the graduate dean. And you all moved to

01:15.372 --> 01:18.196
the Teague building. Yes. Then he retired. He who? 
Couldn't say. Leo Berner, was he the? Leo Berner

01:30.391 --> 01:32.013
was the associate dean. Okay. And then we had two or 
three sometimes assistant deans that handled all

01:32.694 --> 01:38.599
the paperwork. They signed off on the paperwork 
before it went into the computer. So we still had

01:44.064 --> 01:45.205
paperwork. By that time were you the senior staff 
person? I was the administrative secretary.

01:51.471 --> 01:52.412
Right. And who did you have? How many people did you 
have helping you? We had about 10 in there.

02:01.648 --> 02:04.592
If we can count the thesis part, which he was a part 
of it also. But we had to. We had that, we had, I'm

02:07.235 --> 02:19.170
sorry, I can't remember the enrollment and 
graduate programs, but we were graduating 200 or

02:07.235 --> 02:19.170
300 each graduation, and there was a lot of 
paperwork. And then we were trying to get a, a

02:22.557 --> 02:28.405
program that would get rid of the dead wood, 
because we needed the space so the filing cabinets

02:22.557 --> 02:28.405
were full. That was always a constant battle on 
records and where to put them and everything. But

02:34.854 --> 02:36.797
it worked well. Dr. Kunze was good. And then when 
Dr. Kunze retired and Dr. Berner took over, he

02:38.039 --> 02:46.551
pretty much went along the same path as Dr. Kunze 
had established. Describe Leo Berner. Leo Burner

02:50.063 --> 02:51.805
is a sweetheart. He's a nice person. He's 
easygoing. He doesn't like any problems or

02:55.250 --> 03:02.159
troubles or anything to upset the apple cart, so we 
kept things running pretty smooth. I don't think

03:03.120 --> 03:06.785
he made any great progress, but he also didn't lose 
anything either. Dr. Kunze's background was

03:06.985 --> 03:11.371
agronomy and soils. Leo Burner's was 
oceanography, biological oceanography. Did, in

03:17.384 --> 03:24.354
the routine of what they liked or didn't like, what 
was the differences between those two? I'd rather

03:26.637 --> 03:28.179
not comment. Okay, all right. Okay. I have bitter 
memories about it. The, let's see, was it, at what

03:33.025 --> 03:37.972
point did you all start wearing pantsuits? Was it 
under Berner or Coonsy? No, no, no, it was under Dr.

03:40.015 --> 03:42.919
Coonsy in the Coke building. How did y'all make the 
request of him? How did y'all raise the question?

03:47.920 --> 03:53.407
We just started talking among ourselves, you 
know, do you think we could wear pantsuits? Well,

03:55.009 --> 03:56.311
we can just ask. So we got together, two or three of 
us, especially the pretty girls in the office,

03:57.092 --> 04:05.943
they always could get whatever they wanted. But 
no, it was not a problem because it was coming and

04:07.285 --> 04:11.050
they could see it. Did you all use many student 
employees? We used a lot of student wives. That was

04:18.508 --> 04:20.491
part of the problem in that office. All the jobs 
were low-scale, dead-end jobs. So there was

04:24.696 --> 04:25.517
turnover. A lot of turnover. The student wives 
were excellent. We got real good help with the

04:28.761 --> 04:31.885
student wives. But it was... We couldn't keep 
anybody who was very good if they were staying

04:34.233 --> 04:41.003
because there was no place for them to go to 
advance. So we had to fight for, they always

04:42.466 --> 04:52.742
thought the graduate college spent too much 
money, so at least Dr. Kunze said that. And so our

04:52.762 --> 04:54.905
budgets were very trim. He trimmed, he was that 
kind of a man, he trimmed everything to the bare

04:55.185 --> 04:59.532
bones. we had to start putting in for better 
positions in that office in order to maintain it.

05:07.642 --> 05:18.234
During the years that Calhoun was the vice 
president, was there any difference in the

05:07.642 --> 05:18.234
routine? No, Dr. Calhoun was very, he was good to 
all of us. I mean, most of them were afraid of Dr.

05:24.761 --> 05:29.586
Calhoun, but he was... He was very good. He let Dr. 
Kunze do, I mean, they got together on certain

05:31.010 --> 05:38.340
things if there was a problem, but they had no 
problem working together. As far as y'all were

05:39.602 --> 05:45.069
aware, where were the chief academic decisions 
made? The academic decisions in the graduate

05:46.852 --> 05:50.316
office was made through the graduate council. And 
one of the things that, what Rutter wanted Dr.

05:53.545 --> 05:57.689
Kunze to do was put some structure in the graduate 
catalog. It was too flexible, and it was being used

05:58.049 --> 06:04.596
flexibly, you know, depending on who asks. Now, 
who was on the Graduate Council? Who made up the

06:06.077 --> 06:07.478
Graduate Council? I can't tell you, but... Was it 
faculty or deans? They were representatives of

06:12.083 --> 06:14.885
the different colleges. They weren't always the 
deans and not necessarily the deans. And Kunze

06:18.449 --> 06:20.591
presided over it, didn't he? He was the chairman. 
And when the deans... And then it went to the

06:23.144 --> 06:27.151
Academic Programs Committee from the Graduate 
College. So he started building structure into

06:27.171 --> 06:46.903
the graduate catalogs that we could live with and 
use so we could... And the deans met weekly, APC,

06:27.171 --> 06:46.903
Academic Programs Council, or whatever that 
stood for. Yeah. And... Then where did the

06:51.443 --> 06:57.431
decision come from to... Do away with the deans? 
Yeah, do away with the dean of the graduate school.

07:02.138 --> 07:03.179
We're really not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. But I 
think several of the colleges, and I would say

07:06.324 --> 07:18.160
engineering might be one of them, college of 
business might be another one, that wanted to run

07:06.324 --> 07:18.160
their own shows.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.449
And they were growing, too. They were growing big 
time, and they wanted to do their own things. Now,

07:27.201 --> 07:28.604
this was in the 80s? This was in the 80s. I believe 
Dr. Kunze retired in 84, Dr. Berner in 87, so this

07:31.250 --> 07:40.249
is... After that. 88 and 89, we were without a dean. 
It became a director. They made a director. Dr.

07:47.424 --> 07:49.967
Gussman became the director. And he was on the 
graduate council. That was the best thing that

07:52.289 --> 08:01.940
happened for me in those two years was when he 
became director because I could work with Dr.

07:52.289 --> 08:01.940
Gussman because he knew what we were doing and 
everything. I don't know anything about him.

08:03.462 --> 08:04.003
Describe him. Larry Gussman was a lovable, 
energetic... fun kind of person. He's a

08:12.440 --> 08:14.564
mathematician. He worked for NASA. 
G-U-S-E-M-A-N.

08:21.821 --> 08:24.768
He was well-respected. I mean, he did a lot of 
graduate work in the mathematics or the College of

08:24.848 --> 08:28.917
Science. And so he was well prepared to be the 
director when he, and he was my suggestion to the

08:29.690 --> 08:37.537
boss when he asked me who I would want as director. I 
told him, Gusman, and that's who got it. I was

08:40.099 --> 08:44.123
shocked, but I was pleased, too. But he'd made it in 
life different. And then when I retired, they

08:46.545 --> 08:52.470
hired a man to take my job, and in two years, both 
those men were dead. Dr. Gusman died, and the man

08:52.971 --> 08:55.553
that took my place died. Now, you retired what 
year? 1989. So I took it two years, one year without

08:58.900 --> 09:07.392
anybody in the office. And so then the graduate 
programs in each of the colleges were run by the

09:09.435 --> 09:16.926
dean of that college. Well, they still come 
through the graduate office, but there was no

09:17.058 --> 09:23.227
authority particularly in the graduate office. 
But the paperwork still flowed in. It never quit.

09:26.793 --> 09:28.095
But the authority... The authority was pretty 
much established in the colleges. Now, if they

09:31.600 --> 09:41.796
wanted a new degree program, they still had to 
submit paperwork for one to be approved through

09:31.600 --> 09:41.796
the channels, but they had pretty much to say what 
they... Which do you think was, in hindsight,

09:42.196 --> 09:46.002
which do you think was the better system? I only saw 
it from my point of view, so I can't say for the

09:47.213 --> 09:56.818
second one, but I thought

09:47.213 --> 09:56.818
it was more It was a stronger program when there was 
an umbrella overlooking the whole scene. I agree

10:03.353 --> 10:04.435
with you. And it's like they said, once you let the 
toothpaste out of the tube, you can never put it

10:04.455 --> 10:09.783
back. And we were told that from other schools that 
had tried that, and it didn't work. Now I

10:14.611 --> 10:21.743
understand there is a dean there in the graduate 
office now, but I'm not sure what kind of power he

10:14.611 --> 10:21.743
had. But it was, I felt like that, what we had, what 
Dr. Coonsey had worked so hard to structure and

10:24.524 --> 10:36.099
have it overall a good package was now coming loose 
at the end. But see, that's from my standpoint. I

10:38.482 --> 10:39.623
can't speak from theirs. All right. In your 25 
years, which presidents, I'm not going to ask the

10:41.485 --> 10:53.080
negative, to which presidents would you give the 
highest marks for their leadership of Texas A&M?

10:57.903 --> 11:02.148
I'd have to say Rutter simply because I know what he 
did for us. I don't know about any other. I just was

11:06.733 --> 11:10.797
too isolated in the graduate programs to speak for 
the university. Which of the vice presidents for

11:11.017 --> 11:18.886
academic affairs would you give the, now we call it 
provost, but in those days vice, to which would you

11:11.017 --> 11:18.886
give the? I think Dr. Calhoun was the one that was 
most beneficial for us. I agree with you. Why? On

11:24.793 --> 11:27.015
what do you base your opinion? I agree. I just know 
how he supported us, and he was watching over

11:27.556 --> 11:31.481
things. He was not somebody that just let things go 
by without him. But he was watching to see what

11:36.488 --> 11:47.202
happened, and if he had some criticism of it, well, 
he always spoke up, and Dr. Kunze always worked it

11:36.488 --> 11:47.202
out. So I felt like we had his support, and yet he let 
Dr. Kunze do the job he was supposed to do. Now, the

11:55.649 --> 12:00.976
next question has to do with the point of view of you 
as a staff member. When the Board of Regents

12:02.217 --> 12:17.157
recreated the system after Dr. Williams had his 
heart attack, they made him chancellor and

12:02.217 --> 12:17.157
recreated the separate position of president. He 
recommended Dr. Calhoun for that position, but

12:18.278 --> 12:24.306
the board selected Jarvis Miller. Do you remember 
in the Teague building, do you remember what was it

12:24.573 --> 12:34.248
like for you and the other staff members? What 
changes were there? As far as we were concerned, we

12:36.612 --> 12:42.240
were still doing the same thing we were doing 
before, so it really didn't affect us any. As far as

12:43.142 --> 12:49.872
it affecting the dean, it may have, but he didn't 
talk about it. The staff people, the sad thing

12:51.421 --> 12:58.669
about the staff is that we weren't paid enough. We 
worked hard, but we really didn't have a good

12:59.329 --> 13:03.954
salary ever. And were there merit increases for 
staff in those days? The few merit increases you

13:11.122 --> 13:21.293
had were dealt, the dean or, yes, the dean would be 
the one to designate who got it. which really

13:22.184 --> 13:24.307
wasn't always fair.

13:27.130 --> 13:32.056
I think there was more, there were more problems 
with the fact that we were underpaid and

13:27.130 --> 13:32.056
overworked. Most of those offices that we would 
talk to don't have enough to do. We had more than we

13:36.562 --> 13:37.904
could do. And we worked hard and I worked hard and I 
expect everybody else to work hard. It made me a

13:43.090 --> 13:45.593
pretty bitter woman. I mean, bitter, but I was 
just, that's all I did was work. During those

13:51.462 --> 13:56.433
years, what was the busiest time of the year? The 
busiest time of the year was in the springtime. All

14:01.304 --> 14:04.932
of those awards had to be made. A lot of the 
preparations for fall had to be made, the

14:04.952 --> 14:11.226
fellowships. the awards, the graduate student 
awards, association of former students awards,

14:12.151 --> 14:30.174
all of those things came and we were pretty much in 
charge of getting the applications and getting

14:12.151 --> 14:30.174
them ready to be reviewed and that kind of thing. So 
I think spring was the hardest. Summer wasn't

14:33.197 --> 14:36.141
easy, but spring was hard. And of the colleges, 
Again, not going to ask the negative. Which

14:40.231 --> 14:47.704
colleges, from the point of view of the graduate 
school, which colleges did the best job from

14:40.231 --> 14:47.704
your... From my standpoint? Mm-hmm.

14:52.373 --> 14:55.018
Who managed their responsibilities best? I think 
agriculture did. Or at least they were They tried

15:02.287 --> 15:09.157
to work within the system, and if there was a 
problem, then they'd just pick up the phone and

15:02.287 --> 15:09.157
we'd talk about it. But they weren't fighting it. 
In other words, they were just trying to do what we

15:13.262 --> 15:16.827
had established. And I think the agriculture did 
the best job. Were there some deans that you

15:21.514 --> 15:27.282
enjoyed most? Well, let me think of who the deans 
were. The best deans to work with?

15:37.943 --> 15:41.328
I'd have to think about that one. Of course, I did 
work through their administrative secretaries,

15:41.368 --> 15:51.502
so it was not easy for me to say that, because any 
time we had anything to communicate, it was

15:41.368 --> 15:51.502
through the secretary. Which of those 
secretaries were the best to work with? Oh, I liked

15:54.626 --> 15:59.192
them all, let's face it. Mayor Ruth Patronella, 
she was always pleasant to work with. In

16:05.826 --> 16:06.587
agriculture? In agriculture. And Betty Robinson 
in science.

16:13.659 --> 16:15.362
And Peggy Ritchie in liberal arts. Yeah, those are 
people that, like I said, we never had any problem

16:16.745 --> 16:25.399
asking for help or giving help to each other, so it 
worked out. I'm not trying to paint this beautiful

16:25.733 --> 16:31.058
picture, but it was a beautiful picture to work 
during those years. Do you remember, from the

16:32.039 --> 16:41.668
point of view of the graduate office, do you 
remember any outside interference from beyond

16:32.039 --> 16:41.668
the campus ever attempted? Did any regent or 
former student or politician

16:41.708 --> 16:55.521
ever attempt to get somebody graduated or 
admitted or? Not flunked out or anything? I really

16:59.042 --> 17:01.029
can't remember any incident. If it happened, then 
it was kept. I'm not aware of any. I mean, I don't, I

17:06.607 --> 17:09.797
just don't know of any. It was pretty 
straightforward. Either they passed their oral

17:12.193 --> 17:17.441
or they didn't pass their oral or they didn't have 
the GPR. It was, you know, pretty cut and dried. So

17:19.785 --> 17:21.788
there wasn't a lot of flexibility. Now, as far as 
extensions on deadlines, we gave a lot of them. But

17:28.899 --> 17:29.701
that's okay. If we can get somebody graduating and 
give them a little more time, that's fine. And we

17:33.507 --> 17:35.690
had no problem with giving those things. And they 
usually worked out fine. Now that extension on

17:38.431 --> 17:46.982
deadline meant that they had to have their thesis 
turned or dissertation by a certain date and

17:38.431 --> 17:46.982
sometimes that could be extended for them. Well 
those were not easy to give because there was so

17:47.002 --> 17:59.038
much work to be done with those things that we 
couldn't be a lot, very flexible but we're talking

17:47.002 --> 17:59.038
about if they wanted to take their prelim beyond 
the time that they're supposed to have it, like an

17:59.221 --> 18:08.530
extension, or graduate maybe a semester later or 
something like that, that was easy to give. In

18:09.311 --> 18:14.395
dealing with the registrar and director of 
admissions office, compare H.L. Heaton to Ed

18:14.415 --> 18:15.737
Cooper.

18:19.360 --> 18:25.566
Of course, when I knew Mr. Heaton, I was working for 
Mr. Perriman, and I didn't have a lot of

18:26.002 --> 18:28.045
interaction with Mr. Eaton. He was always 
strolling around the office looking at what we

18:28.065 --> 18:33.792
were doing and very pleasant. Ed Cooper, the 
people I worked with under Ed Cooper were super. By

18:42.764 --> 18:50.153
the way, our present registrar, Don Carter, used 
to be our graduate assistant. That reminds me,

18:51.213 --> 18:52.635
yes. Describe him as a graduate assistant. Oh, Don 
was fun. He was a very good graduate assistant, but

18:58.264 --> 19:07.699
he was lots of fun, and he loved to tease Mrs. 
Watson, and she loved it in spite of her saying she

18:58.264 --> 19:07.699
didn't. She loved that. But Don could clean up the 
storeroom, the closet, with all the supplies in,

19:08.860 --> 19:17.954
to perfection, and that's the way he wanted it. 
Mm-hmm. I used to leave a drawer out behind me where

19:22.263 --> 19:33.134
I had some forms in it and there was a passageway and 
Don got very upset with me because he was going to

19:22.263 --> 19:33.134
fall and break his neck on that drawer if I didn't 
close it. But it was a good time.

19:41.102 --> 19:45.926
Don Carter was a splendid student worker. One of 
the best.

19:49.567 --> 19:54.895
About what was the continuous staff? About how 
many people did you all have? In the early days, we

19:58.700 --> 20:00.804
had about five. I think that would about cover it. 
Admissions and bookkeeper, receptionist and a

20:03.908 --> 20:12.000
typist, the administrative secretary. That's 
about all we had. Then in the later days, what, 15?

20:18.129 --> 20:18.730
10 to 15? Well, they actually saved about 10. I'll 
have to stop and think about that. Of course, we

20:25.741 --> 20:33.432
used a lot of student help as much as possible, 
which without it we couldn't have handled. And

20:33.732 --> 20:38.859
don't I remember part of the time in the Teague 
building there were people with desks out in the

20:33.732 --> 20:38.859
hallway? In the hallway, yes. And then we had 
offices down the hall. When they added a

20:43.225 --> 20:45.088
recruiter, Jack Ivins came in and they made him a 
recruiter. He took up some offices and he had an

20:48.738 --> 20:54.547
assistant that was working with him. And

20:55.849 --> 21:01.098
I guess that's the only office we had down the hall. 
But we just had filing cabinets every nook and

21:02.861 --> 21:09.372
cranny. As you think about all those, that quarter 
century, what were some of the happiest times, the

21:09.976 --> 21:16.824
high points?

21:20.108 --> 21:20.889
The high points. Most enjoyable. Christmas 
parties. Where were they held? Well, Dr. Kunze

21:27.516 --> 21:30.139
would always have his at his house. And I was trying 
to think, Dr. Hall had it, where do we have it? I

21:39.794 --> 21:41.255
think we had it at his house, too. And then we had it 
at Werner's home. But it was fun when we got away

21:46.020 --> 21:50.123
from the office and could socialize together. 
When we weren't working, that was a good time.

21:55.268 --> 21:56.569
Other high points? Of course, we had, I can't say 
for the graduate college high points. It was just

22:04.016 --> 22:08.940
when personal people we'd worked with got married 
or had children or something like that. That was

22:09.308 --> 22:12.316
always nice, and we always gave them parties. Was 
it also a feel-good event when you'd finally sent

22:13.940 --> 22:23.605
off all of that commencement's dissertation and 
thesis lists and everything to the registrar? I

22:24.226 --> 22:34.592
would like to say it was, but the only problem with 
that is I had everything stacked up waiting for me

22:24.226 --> 22:34.592
to work on the next graduation that had backed up 
while I was finishing that one. So it was just a

22:34.632 --> 22:37.480
continuous process. It was good to be through and 
have those lists turned in, yes. Now, y'all never

22:41.742 --> 22:45.986
had any catastrophe, no fire, no... No. No, where 
everything went wrong. No, I found that during the

22:48.889 --> 23:10.348
Christmas holidays, I would always pick up the 
mail and open it and bring it up to the office, and

22:48.889 --> 23:10.348
two times I found the office flooded because the 
pipes had burst and the floors were under water,

22:48.889 --> 23:10.348
but no damage to the equipment, just water damage.

23:10.700 --> 23:15.807
our experiences with the new automated typing 
equipment. Yes, talk about that. Of course it was a

23:17.449 --> 23:29.384
wonderful thing except that the equipment we got 
to begin with was not good and we would try it and

23:17.449 --> 23:29.384
keep trying it and have them in and everything. It 
was more frustrating than anything. But finally

23:31.427 --> 23:40.639
we were able to get some really good word 
processing equipment which made our lives much

23:31.427 --> 23:40.639
easier and was the answer to it. And of course we 
went into the computers. Everybody had their own

23:44.037 --> 23:48.601
computer and we had our own software that we worked 
into. Certain people would do certain things and

23:48.981 --> 23:52.464
that was good. Make believe that someone didn't 
know the dimensions of the building. About how big

23:57.308 --> 24:03.393
was the data processing center when it first 
opened? How big was a building? It was big. It was

24:05.976 --> 24:07.997
very big. And also when we asked for reports we 
would have to get them in batches. And if there was

24:14.855 --> 24:19.902
something wrong with the report, there were 
batches of paper that had to be trashed. We tried to

24:21.084 --> 24:24.509
use it as scrap paper, but we couldn't use that much 
paper. But we'd have to run, because that was the

24:25.070 --> 24:31.419
economical time to run that was a certain time of 
the evening. And of course, we had to go down and

24:32.180 --> 24:40.512
pick up our reports at the Data Processing Center, 
bring them up, look at them. trial and error, they

24:42.635 --> 24:44.837
finally got straightened out. But it was a great 
system. Right now, as you were getting ready to

24:48.962 --> 24:58.273
conclude, have we left out anything that you can 
think of, any important topics? Not that I can

24:58.293 --> 24:59.774
think of at the moment. I probably will when I go 
home. I think of a lot of things. Well, we can put

25:02.637 --> 25:05.661
that in when we get the typed version. Well, I just 
remember my last two years was so difficult

25:06.462 --> 25:11.207
because All of a sudden, there were no deans, and 
the associate provost for research and graduate

25:11.862 --> 25:20.653
studies was across campus. We moved all the excess 
filing cabinets out of the dean's offices into the

25:22.575 --> 25:30.966
hall, and he wanted all those things destroyed. He 
wanted everything trashed. Now, is that to whom

25:35.231 --> 25:37.934
you reported then? Yes, sir. I didn't. What I did 
was move myself out of his office. He had an office

25:47.075 --> 25:52.782
in our building, and my office was next to it, of 
course, like Kunze's and Berner's. But I took

25:53.162 --> 26:09.021
myself out of there and went into the graduate 
college office where I could take care of the

25:53.162 --> 26:09.021
records

25:53.162 --> 26:09.021
and moved my clerk who was in the graduate office 
into my office to take care of the associate

26:10.334 --> 26:14.078
provost when he was there or on the phone or 
anything. So I said, you take care of him. I'm going

26:15.779 --> 26:17.221
to take care of the graduate office. That's the 
only way I could have operated. And it worked fine.

26:25.229 --> 26:26.450
But it was difficult. I was losing my hair. It was 
very dramatic. In those tough times, to whom did

26:33.738 --> 26:36.240
you turn for advice?

26:39.545 --> 26:49.080
I called, at one time, I called Dr. Gussman in the 
office and asked him this particular question I

26:39.545 --> 26:49.080
was not sure about. He told me. I was fine. But then 
when my boss got, found out about it, he came in and

26:52.446 --> 27:06.328
chewed me out, told me never to do that again, that I 
was to come to him with any questions I had. So I was

27:06.747 --> 27:08.590
so tranquilized by then. I was on tranquilizers. I 
was just, okay, he's chewing me out, but it's okay.

27:14.019 --> 27:18.006
And I didn't, I really didn't react because I knew I 
had to do what I had to do. And I just overcame it.

27:21.452 --> 27:22.414
Just kept going. Had no choice. But everybody was 
so nice to me. I must say all the graduate faculty

27:26.300 --> 27:30.848
that I dealt with, all the problems we had, they 
couldn't have been nicer. And I was pleased at the

27:34.639 --> 27:39.304
way that I did it and they supported me. So I got that 
out of it anyway. Do you remember any goofy things

27:42.708 --> 27:47.173
that happened? Mistakes or snafus?

27:56.202 --> 28:01.408
I can just remember working, you know, just trying 
to keep my head above water. And I know I didn't

28:02.283 --> 28:08.432
enjoy the office parties because I just couldn't 
get away from the work. I just took it with me

28:08.532 --> 28:10.195
everywhere I went. And fortunately, I lived 
alone, so I didn't. But I just had to keep going. But

28:18.688 --> 28:20.971
I burned out. And I've warned people about that 
that are working like that, that you will

28:21.492 --> 28:25.418
eventually burn out. And then you're no good to 
anybody. All right. Now, looking back over all

28:28.462 --> 28:30.265
those years, If you could award stars of 
gratitude, to whom would you give the stars? Oh, I

28:35.313 --> 28:38.878
have a lot of people I'm grateful to. The main 
person is Dr. Kunze, who was so... Because you must

28:38.918 --> 28:47.930
realize, I was not a trained secretary. Never have 
been. But he just made me feel like I was doing

28:49.332 --> 28:55.941
great, and I appreciate it, which now I know I 
wasn't. But... He was very understanding and

28:58.190 --> 29:05.317
everything so I am most grateful to him and to Mr. 
Kidd, Professor Kidd, Leo Berner. This is Harry

29:05.337 --> 29:06.078
Kidd? Yes. Out of the English? Yes, Harry Kidd. 
What was his... He was an assistant dean. He did a

29:11.283 --> 29:18.311
lot of Dr. Kudzi's writing or fixed what he wrote. 
He never got over his German.

29:23.249 --> 29:53.087
ancestry but he was always willing able to to help I 
just I have a lot of people all the people I worked

29:23.249 --> 29:53.087
with through the colleges very supportive and I 
seem to be painting this beautiful picture but in

29:23.249 --> 29:53.087
that text that that really they were fine people I 
mean I had no problems with dealing with the people

29:23.249 --> 29:53.087
I learned how I learned how to handle people also Is 
it correct that in those years this place was much

29:53.455 --> 29:59.565
more personal than it would be in the late 80s? Yes. 
Which is fine. You could work out a lot of things

30:04.313 --> 30:06.617
before it ever got to paper. And that's why we 
prefer to just work out what you want and then they

30:07.759 --> 30:14.230
do the paperwork and then it's fine. But It was just 
a constant battle, simply because there was such

30:17.080 --> 30:22.226
quantity. And we just didn't have enough people to 
cover it all. In summary, what were you most proud

30:26.571 --> 30:29.975
of in those 25 years? The fact that I worked for 
George Coonsey and his

30:31.937 --> 30:46.834
goals and his accomplishments during those 
years, I became a part of it. A small part of it, but

30:47.337 --> 30:49.421
still a part of it. I was there when it happened and 
supported him the best I could. He was a work... He

30:55.231 --> 30:56.213
was a taskmaster. He worked hard. He worked harder 
than we did, but we worked hard. But he worked

31:01.882 --> 31:02.744
harder. And the last question, what feelings do 
you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today? It is

31:09.436 --> 31:10.257
my... It is my family, so to speak. I feel like I'm a 
part of this university in some small way, and I

31:14.747 --> 31:20.439
care about it tremendously. I don't think I care 
any less than some of the former students and

31:20.660 --> 31:29.038
people that have belonged here. Although I was 
never a student, I really feel
