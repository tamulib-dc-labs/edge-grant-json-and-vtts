WEBVTT

00:01.128 --> 00:09.618
Marmaduke Knox Thornton, born in Helen, 
Arkansas, February the 8th, 1892. And could you

00:09.678 --> 00:18.329
give us a brief biographical statement of your 
early experiences in education, your boyhood? We

00:19.730 --> 00:29.262
moved to Marlin, Texas in 1893,

00:19.730 --> 00:29.262
and for the next seven years I was As soon as I was 
able to understand, my mother taught me the same

00:30.035 --> 00:39.988
courses that the children were having. And when 
seven years old, I was ready for fifth grade. But we

00:45.295 --> 00:51.583
had moved to Mississippi at that time, and they 
wouldn't acknowledge that and put me in the

00:45.295 --> 00:51.583
fourth. Now, that's pretty well that part of it. Is 
there anything you want to amplify on that? Oh, if

00:59.515 --> 01:06.667
you could describe the school in Mississippi that 
you were put into, was it a one-room school, a

00:59.515 --> 01:06.667
larger? No, it was,

01:07.188 --> 01:25.759
they were beginning at that time to more or less 
consolidate the various activities, and I went to

01:07.188 --> 01:25.759
what we call the greenhouse, which had Grades 
from, as I recall, from the third up to the eighth.

01:33.807 --> 01:36.510
We had no grades above the eighth at that time. What 
town was this in? Starkville, Mississippi.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.317
Starkville? Yeah. I guess pretty much that takes 
care of that. I entered fourth grade in 1890. Nine,

01:53.802 --> 01:56.045
seven years old. And you went all the way through 
the eighth grade there? I went through the eighth

01:58.547 --> 02:05.255
grade and headed into the ninth grade, which they 
established the year when I finished. The eighth

02:05.856 --> 02:08.078
grade, they established the ninth grade. But I had 
an accident and had to drop out of school. So...

02:12.183 --> 02:14.966
What did you do after that? I wrote to schools where 
I'd give them assistantship or something, help

02:15.126 --> 02:22.915
pay my way. at the same time studying for a doctor. 
The only folks that answered my letter was this

02:27.414 --> 02:29.917
one. And I took this job, but they didn't have any 
pre-med courses at that time. When did you, and

02:37.868 --> 02:40.091
what year did you come to Texas? I got off the train 
at College Station, Texas at 12.15.

02:51.464 --> 02:58.715
February the 15th, 1911, and went on the payroll 
February the 16th, 1911. And you were doing what?

03:01.118 --> 03:04.263
Instructor in chemistry and chemical 
engineering. My goodness, from education to

03:04.283 --> 03:07.948
chemical engineering, that's quite a switch, 
isn't it? Well, you see, I

03:08.109 --> 03:17.843
worked as a chemist for the blast furnaces. during 
the two years that I was out, so I didn't come in from

03:18.127 --> 03:22.293
law. You had good practical experience then. Yes, 
and another thing, there are courses that today

03:24.976 --> 03:40.378
they take in high school

03:24.976 --> 03:40.378
that were just on the horizon when I came here. What 
we call the electrolytic dissociation theory,

03:41.219 --> 03:47.948
and it is every boy in a 10th grade in high school, 
knows what that's all about, was only about five or

03:48.383 --> 04:00.575
six years old in Germany, and we were just now 
beginning to pick it up. So that and many other

04:01.976 --> 04:13.347
things, chemistry since 1910 has been 
revolutionized, and it's revolutionized about

04:01.976 --> 04:13.347
every 10 years. There is no science that I can dream 
of that has had as much improvement and change and

04:17.510 --> 04:25.537
development as the chemistry. It's astounding. 
Yes, Dr. Lindsay said basically the same thing

04:29.781 --> 04:36.567
when I talked to you. What were your first 
impressions when you came to school here? What was

04:39.429 --> 04:40.690
the campus like? What were the students like? Oh, 
Lord.

04:47.868 --> 04:50.812
You want the raw details? Sure, just want you to 
remember. Excuse me just a second. I got off the

04:58.501 --> 05:05.870
train at 12.15 on the 15th of February, 1911. I 
asked the station man where I could get something

05:05.890 --> 05:12.998
to eat. He says, you can't get anything to eat here, 
but you can go over to Boyd's store, which is right

05:14.935 --> 05:25.086
across the railroad track at that time, and he gets 
you some crackers and cheese. I said, well, that

05:27.228 --> 05:28.570
ain't going to get by. I said, do you mind if I leave 
my suitcase and trunk here till I go up? I said, if

05:35.858 --> 05:42.805
what you say is true, I'm going to be on that 3 
o'clock train headed east. I said, where is the

05:42.825 --> 05:44.487
college? He said, right up the way there, you just 
follow that road there. I said, what's that fence

05:50.835 --> 05:52.016
for? He said, to keep the boys in. I said, hold 
everything. Am I at a college or at a penitentiary?

06:01.369 --> 06:02.551
He said, this is a college. I said, what's the idea 
of keeping the boys in? Well, they don't want them

06:06.756 --> 06:08.198
running around. I said, uh-huh. I still want you to 
keep these until I catch this train. So I started

06:17.896 --> 06:18.877
out. The thing that struck me as I came in, not only 
was there a fence, but there was a cedar grove on

06:20.399 --> 06:28.607
each side of the road. It's a beauty. It really was a 
beautiful grove on both sides. And I got in the

06:34.953 --> 06:39.077
middle of that road there, I could see the old main 
building. And that was all. And the flagpole. And

06:43.133 --> 06:43.834
that was all. But as I went into the campus,

06:45.297 --> 06:52.388
I saw two things. A big drill field and, gosh, all 
this bunch of tents in the world. And I couldn't

06:57.976 --> 07:01.342
figure out what sort of a place this was.

07:04.306 --> 07:06.710
It housed the students in tents. I had just come 
from school. school that housed all the boys in

07:09.449 --> 07:11.933
dormitories.

07:14.516 --> 07:18.602
But I followed the instructions and turned to the 
left. Nice little house over there, across from

07:20.545 --> 07:26.895
where all these tents were. I later learned that's 
where a fellow by the name of Kyle lived.

07:33.524 --> 07:38.832
Then there was another little house, a nice little 
cottage, and I learned later that's where Dr.

07:33.524 --> 07:38.832
Fountain lived. head of English department. The 
next house I saw was Dr. Ellinger's house, I

07:43.050 --> 07:47.455
learned later. Then there was a big building 
there, sitting back from the street. And boys were

07:57.927 --> 08:00.710
coming out of that building, picking their teeth. 
Well, I wasn't putting that going into the

08:02.753 --> 08:06.777
dormitory, into that mess hall and get something 
to eat. I was going to get something to eat. the

08:10.722 --> 08:12.624
instructor's aide. The next house I ran into was a 
nice little house, very imposing. I learned later

08:19.350 --> 08:24.334
it was the president's home.

08:24.354 --> 08:29.559
And Andy Godwin across from the president's home, 
there was some construction work going up. It

08:29.579 --> 08:32.282
later wound up to be Milner Hall. And another one 
there, there was some construction work going on

08:34.083 --> 08:38.367
later that became Leggett Hall. Well, I turned to 
the left there in following directions and ran

08:39.292 --> 08:50.384
into Emil Lehmann, a schoolmate in Mississippi. 
And he informed me, he's glad to see me, and

08:52.286 --> 08:58.213
informed me that they was looking for me. Well, the 
thing that struck me was if they was looking for me,

08:59.234 --> 09:07.543
they were a long way from the depot where I got off.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.059
I told him what I wanted. He sort of got a little 
serious. He said, I don't know whether Miss Still

09:16.204 --> 09:18.607
will feed you or not. I said, it don't make any 
difference, Emil. She either feeds me, or I'm on

09:22.932 --> 09:29.439
that train going back to Birmingham this 
afternoon.

09:34.204 --> 09:35.686
Well, he went back with me.

09:38.790 --> 09:39.150
And opened the double door in the old Shirley, and 
Mrs. Still come barging out of the kitchen,

09:45.577 --> 09:53.685
sweating and steaming, on the right he had to open 
the door, and I told her I wanted something to eat.

09:55.226 --> 09:59.230
Well, the dinner was over, and she didn't feed 
tranchants anyhow. I said, I'm not supposed to be a

09:59.771 --> 10:01.993
tranchant here. Well, I said, maybe. I said, I want 
something to eat. Well, Emil talked her into

10:09.151 --> 10:10.934
feeding me.

10:14.078 --> 10:21.990
And after dinner, he took me and lead and showed me 
where the chemistry department was and left me. He

10:22.010 --> 10:30.202
was in a new building called, now known as the Nagel 
Hall, or the Civil Engineering Building.

10:34.969 --> 10:35.850
I went on in. There was a great big man sitting at a 
desk on the second floor. At that time, nobody on

10:41.927 --> 10:44.670
the first floor. The whistle hadn't blown.

10:50.975 --> 11:00.143
I walked in, introduced myself, and he's in a big 
roaring voice, a very melodious voice. I learned

11:00.584 --> 11:01.485
to love it. But it could very easily scare the fool 
out of us. a recalcitrant student, and he said, I'm

11:06.948 --> 11:12.697
J.C. Blake. I'm glad you're here. Well, I said to 
him, Doc, I just want to know if it's all right with

11:15.442 --> 11:25.558
you if I just cancel out my agreement with you and I 
catch that train and leave here. I said, I don't

11:26.460 --> 11:30.947
like anything I've seen about this place up to the 
present time.

11:33.897 --> 11:39.023
Blake took off, fed me a bunch of hogwash. And I 
learned when another man showed up here who went

11:40.626 --> 11:49.717
through the same experience, he gave him the same 
bunch of hogwash.

11:53.021 --> 12:01.592
But he convinced me that if I didn't stay,

11:53.021 --> 12:01.592
the school would fold up. And it was up to me to stay 
there and make the school a success. And so I agreed

12:08.519 --> 12:13.423
with him that I'd stay till the 1st of June.

12:16.807 --> 12:17.427
He said, good. I noticed that Mr. Nelson has just 
come in. Mr. Nelson will show you your duties.

12:27.057 --> 12:28.558
Nelson was glad to see me. He was the bottom man on 
the totem pole, and when I came in, I became the

12:29.973 --> 12:35.219
bottom man on the totem pole. Now, what Nelson is 
this? W.P. Nelson. Nelson was an instructor in the

12:39.784 --> 12:43.188
chemistry department at that time. He left here 
during the war, the First World War.

12:49.275 --> 12:52.799
Well, Nelson took me in tow. He says, you're going 
to be responsible for the stock room. that wasn't

12:59.015 --> 13:27.992
part of my agreement but it's okay he said in 
addition to that you'll have charge of the

12:59.015 --> 13:27.992
laboratories for freshmen for first year 
students and they'll be in these three

12:59.015 --> 13:27.992
dormitories and you'll assist dr frapps a man who 
taught organic chemistry in his laboratory right

12:59.015 --> 13:27.992
there

12:59.015 --> 13:27.992
and You'll assist me. I'll be downstairs. I said, 
no, I won't either. Well, I got to have some help. I

13:36.252 --> 13:37.354
said, you don't need me. Well, I got the keys to the 
stock room. He said, now we'll go to the basement,

13:43.724 --> 13:47.190
and I'll show you what you do down there.

13:50.716 --> 13:55.144
And he showed me a machine, a gas machine that made 
artificial gas for burners out of gasoline. Well,

14:03.689 --> 14:04.871
I was familiar with that. We had one in Bessemer 
before we left, and I learned something about it.

14:10.219 --> 14:16.268
But I looked at that machine, and I said, Nelson, 
how many burners you going to drag on that? He said

14:16.288 --> 14:16.989
75. I said, what's the size of that machine? He said 
25. And he said, it gives us lots of trouble. I said,

14:25.718 --> 14:27.000
I can imagine. I said, okay. What else I want to do? 
He showed me a bunch of bottles.

14:35.229 --> 14:44.520
And he said, these lost their labels, and you can 
test them, and if we find out what they are, we'll

14:35.229 --> 14:44.520
put a label on them and put them back in stock, and 
you can test them. Well, I saw a bottle about, a

14:45.862 --> 14:54.392
gallon bottle, I was going to say yea high, that's 
what it was, but a gallon bottle, and I looked at it,

14:55.047 --> 14:55.888
I said, what's in that? He said, here's some stuff 
that the veterinary department left up there and I

14:57.671 --> 15:02.518
don't know. I said, well, let's find out. I took the 
top off and opened it up and it was a concentrated

15:07.366 --> 15:19.384
extract of pool cat ammunition.

15:19.617 --> 15:25.163
Well, I was glad to get that because I said, I'm 
going to find out what makes that stuff function.

15:26.965 --> 15:27.446
Well, I didn't. Later on, some student found it. He 
put it to some very

15:31.891 --> 15:37.257
uncomfortable usage. But I was going to analyze 
it. I was perfectly sure I could. Today, I'm not so

15:45.205 --> 15:47.548
sure. But I went back upstairs then. I said, OK. I 
said, you go on upstairs. I'll take over. The first

16:00.358 --> 16:05.423
thing I did is I desensitized that gas machine.

16:10.507 --> 16:16.573
Any fire inspector that had come by would have 
locked the thing up and stuck me in the clink. But we

16:18.308 --> 16:21.653
got gas that afternoon for 75 burners. As soon as 
the boys at 4 o'clock left, I went back and put the

16:22.495 --> 16:29.265
machine working like it ought to. And I don't think 
anyone ever found out just what I was doing to that

16:30.287 --> 16:36.256
bloody machine to make it work. But it worked 
there. But that was my... Then I went up and I found

16:41.545 --> 16:45.389
out that the boys wanted evaporating dishes. They 
signed for an evaporating dish on a little blue

16:45.449 --> 16:50.655
slip or beaker or anything else. After a while, Dr. 
Blake came in, asked me how I was getting along. I

16:56.321 --> 16:58.224
said, I don't know. I said, you don't have much 
stock. He said, no, we don't have much stock. He

17:02.348 --> 17:05.652
said, we got $1,500 to run this department on. And 
it takes every cent of it, and we can't buy much

17:06.893 --> 17:10.337
goods. He said, it just takes every cent we can dig 
up to operate the department. Now, that, of

17:15.313 --> 17:17.416
course, does not include salaries. That was 
operating cost. But these boys were saying, I

17:21.882 --> 17:27.910
said, do these boys pay for that material, the 
stuff that they break? No, he said, we never billed

17:28.471 --> 17:32.296
them. I said, well, is it all right if I bill them? He 
said, well, they've never done it. But we'll try

17:39.886 --> 17:40.847
it. So the first of the month, after checking in and 
checking out and working back, I sent a bill

17:42.481 --> 17:50.411
through for them. But that comes later. That 
wasn't the first day. Now, if I had taken one of

17:54.676 --> 18:07.172
these striped kitties and tossed it on the dance 
floor, I couldn't have caused any more

17:54.676 --> 18:07.172
consternation than the idea of the chemistry 
department charging these birds for stuff they

17:54.676 --> 18:07.172
broke. Well, 5 o'clock, I decided I'd go down and 
get my stuff and send it up to the Shirley Annex.

18:17.089 --> 18:21.534
Now, that was a building just adjoining the 
Shirley where we ate. The Shirley proper had some

18:22.555 --> 18:27.261
rooms upstairs.

18:29.784 --> 18:31.786
The Shirley Annex had a bunch of new rooms. I was 
trying to figure it. Let's see, I can figure it

18:33.849 --> 18:35.491
pretty easily. It's 4 times 2 is 8 times 3 is 32 
rooms. that single instructors and teachers were

18:40.666 --> 18:45.074
profs. And across the road from it was a yellow 
house that the elite among the instructors and so

18:45.094 --> 18:53.308
on lived in.

18:57.376 --> 19:04.328
If you didn't hold your girl just in a certain way 
when you danced with her, you couldn't get in that

18:57.376 --> 19:04.328
other building. except for the fact that Charles 
Perea, the dean of the college, lived over there

19:06.063 --> 19:12.252
and had two rooms. And, of course, he was one of the 
elite. Is this kind of a social clique over there,

19:17.459 --> 19:21.925
rather than elite? Well, we didn't have any 
cliques in those days. Of course, it don't make any

19:25.791 --> 19:31.519
difference where you go. In a few days, their group 
began to segregate. It's not a clique in one sense

19:36.944 --> 19:41.648
of the word, in another sense of the word, it would 
be. These were, though, over in the yellow house,

19:42.189 --> 19:50.736
were those that held their heads just a little 
higher than the rest of us. Do you remember what

19:50.756 --> 19:54.239
kind of rent you had to pay in the Shirley Handels?

19:57.822 --> 19:58.723
No, I don't. I think it's probably, probably,

20:09.412 --> 20:12.056
$15 to $20 a month. Did that include meals? Yes, it 
did include meals. It may have been a little more

20:15.100 --> 20:16.181
than that. It wasn't a whole lot. By our standards 
today, it was not, but according to our standards

20:17.483 --> 20:29.619
back there, it was pretty good because there's a 
little difference in pay scales then and here. If

20:29.679 --> 20:33.124
I'm not prying too much, can I ask you how much you 
came to A&M for? I came to A&M for the munificent sum

20:33.144 --> 20:37.770
of $600 a year. My goodness. But the president of 
the institution only drew $3,600. Dean Pereira

20:42.901 --> 20:46.505
drew $3,000. So $600 a year was quite a livable sum 
then. You could live on it, sure. We didn't own

20:55.756 --> 20:58.319
automobiles in those days. Did you take a cut in pay 
from? Yeah, I took a cut in pay, but not much. Five

21:06.027 --> 21:07.349
dollars a month. Five dollars a month. a week maybe 
or maybe more. I just got tired of looking at the

21:11.399 --> 21:17.551
moon.

21:18.553 --> 21:29.655
See I was working on the night shift and the night 
shift consisted in those days of going to work at

21:18.553 --> 21:29.655
six o'clock and working until seven the next 
morning. It was a long time. But I went down and took

21:34.415 --> 21:39.380
off in the whistle blue. I went down to the depot to 
get my suitcase and arrange my trunk. Emil Neyman

21:44.766 --> 21:58.360
and another fellow in the physics department by 
the name of Leon Scala

21:58.897 --> 22:23.238
I said, Leon, that's one of the Skeeler boys, but 
Frank Skeeler was an instructor in physics, and he

21:58.897 --> 22:23.238
and Emil had gone down to the depot and got my trunk 
and suitcase and had it hauled and put in their room

21:58.897 --> 22:23.238
because there were no empty rooms, and there were 
three of us lived in that room the rest of the year.

22:24.980 --> 22:28.903
Emil, I mean, Frank and Emil slept in the double 
bed, and I had a single bed. Very cozy arrangement.

22:33.256 --> 22:37.081
It's kind of crowded. Yes, but we weren't 
accustomed to much.

22:42.869 --> 22:46.934
At supper I met all the rest of the fellas. Some of 
them I consider top hands in anybody's works. I

22:53.023 --> 22:54.925
learned to love them. The others I learned to 
tolerate. Now that's my first day. That was quite a

23:00.119 --> 23:01.681
full day, wasn't it?

23:06.168 --> 23:06.308
Oh, my. Well, can you tell us a little bit about your 
career at A&M, going from the first day and what

23:07.069 --> 23:14.340
courses you might have taught? Well, the first 
year I was here, I ran the first year laboratory

23:14.420 --> 23:29.502
and assisted Dr. Blake in setting up lecture and 
listened to his lectures so that I would be able to

23:31.912 --> 23:39.422
help him when he wanted a demonstration. And I want 
to say that Dr. Blake was 25 years ahead of his time.

23:47.552 --> 23:57.345
He was one of the best educated men in chemistry in 
this country at that time. and his assistant was

23:58.186 --> 24:05.396
equally good, a fellow by the name of McDougal,

23:58.186 --> 24:05.396
F.H. McDougal.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.604
He taught the chemical engineers. Blake was 
overseer and taught mostly the first year men. Dr.

24:18.674 --> 24:22.680
Frapps taught agricultural chemistry. Blake 
taught organic chemistry and general chemistry.

24:28.628 --> 24:32.013
Nelson was analytical chemistry for the chemical 
engineers.

24:43.068 --> 24:47.333
I could have said I got a raise to $720 for the next 
year. That

24:47.374 --> 24:56.526
thing went

24:47.374 --> 24:56.526
on up. for the year 1915-16, I had 1440, and they had 
jumped, that jumped me $200, and those

24:57.282 --> 25:19.392
got a jump of $400.

25:22.358 --> 25:34.193
Well, at that time, as I said, I was no longer the 
bottom man on the totem pole, but I still was

25:22.358 --> 25:34.193
carrying an awful lot of Nelson's work as well as 
some of the other. And when I learned that Nelson

25:36.677 --> 25:44.006
got a $400 raise and I only got a $200 raise, I blew my 
stack.

25:47.150 --> 25:52.197
And at that time, Dr. Hedges was in charge of the 
department. I told him that I was going to get

25:54.168 --> 26:06.245
$1,580 or $1,640,

25:54.168 --> 26:06.245
and he could make up his mind which it would be. He 
went over to see Brassell, the president, and he

26:06.325 --> 26:14.256
came back and said, Dr. Brassell just says there 
isn't that much money. He can't let you have it. I

26:16.099 --> 26:17.581
said, I figured he'd do that. Here's my letter of 
resignation. He said, you can't quit. I said, I

26:22.748 --> 26:23.449
have. I said, I'll leave here the first day of 
November.

26:29.918 --> 26:34.804
And about 30 minutes later, Dr. Brazell called up 
and told me to come over. He wanted to see me. He told

26:37.067 --> 26:42.834
me that he had just found some monies he didn't know 
he had. And that I was going to get $1,620, I guess it

26:42.854 --> 26:48.180
was. Delce was getting $1,660. Does that work out 
right? Whether it works out right or not,

26:54.243 --> 26:56.906
something like that. He just put me in as his 
segundo. I see. Okay. And did you have any second

27:03.514 --> 27:06.798
thoughts about coming back to this place? No, 
because at the close of the war,

27:07.459 --> 27:24.199
I had made up my mind that I wasn't going to stay in 
the country where the snow that fell on the first

27:07.459 --> 27:24.199
day of December was still on the ground for the 15th 
day of April. Where is the Picatinny Arsenal?

27:28.061 --> 27:31.205
Northern part of Dover, New Jersey. Cold country. 
A thousand feet above New York City. And we'd be

27:39.015 --> 27:44.142
having snow and ice and New York would be fairly 
warm.

27:46.965 --> 27:51.291
So then you came back here at the close of the war 
then? Mm-hmm. I see. and is what, number two man in

27:53.322 --> 27:56.647
chemistry school? Professor of industrial 
chemistry in charge of the work in chemical

27:57.989 --> 28:06.762
engineering. I see. I held that job until 1935 when 
the depression

28:08.765 --> 28:22.266
soured me on the whole thing and I went into the 
extension service and worked within agriculture

28:23.208 --> 28:28.014
from then until 1957. What soured you? On Kemet, 
you said you got soured on the whole thing. Were you

28:32.699 --> 28:33.860
talking about the school? No, no. I got soured 
here. We spent four years trying to develop young

28:37.685 --> 28:50.059
men that

28:37.685 --> 28:50.059
take that place and the industry and society.

28:57.609 --> 29:00.273
And when they graduated, there was no place for 
them. I had boys by Jimenez in 32 and 33 go to work for

29:01.755 --> 29:08.004
$25 a month. And one boy went to, came to me and said, 
how much I was out of yet? I said, a hundred and a

29:14.133 --> 29:15.355
quarter. But he said, so-and-so offered me 50. I 
said, did you take it? He said, yes. I said, good.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.488
Some of the boys went near me. That's where

29:31.192 --> 29:37.444
Al Ludeke and Cepha,

29:39.955 --> 29:42.058
No, there were three or four of them. I alluded to 
this one. They all came out as Major Generals. I

29:45.743 --> 29:50.570
came to think, I was trying to say CIFR, but it 
wasn't CIFR. It was something like that. CIFR in

29:53.234 --> 29:54.496
that period. They went down and every one of them 
came out as Major Generals. Top of their hands. No

29:59.944 --> 30:01.626
place for them. Well, could you tell us a little bit 
about the depression here at the school? How did it

30:05.161 --> 30:10.649
affect the school or the students, other than not 
being jobless when they got out? No, man.

30:15.876 --> 30:27.732
They just more or less, I would say that everybody 
more or less accepted it. in a fatalistic sort of a

30:30.378 --> 30:32.100
way. Was the school adversely affected? Was it 
badly affected? No, because we scratched and made

30:39.630 --> 30:44.376
do and kept on going. Then it wasn't probably maybe 
as bad here as it was in other parts of the country

30:44.416 --> 30:50.043
then? Probably not. In other words, we didn't have 
the money. The legislature cut our monies out.

30:58.414 --> 31:00.216
Didn't cut them out, but reduced them. And all we 
did was just pull up our belts

31:01.630 --> 31:13.602
and drive by. Did the school ever have any trouble 
paying you? What? Did the school ever have any

31:17.906 --> 31:21.329
trouble making its payments to the faculty? They 
always got you checks. Yes, but that wasn't the

31:24.572 --> 31:27.695
school. That was the state.

31:32.630 --> 31:51.007
The

31:32.630 --> 31:51.007
banks in Brown tried to carry those certificates 
without discounting them, but they couldn't make

31:32.630 --> 31:51.007
it eternally, and finally they had to start 
discounting them. Yes, they had that. In a way,

31:53.189 --> 31:55.271
they paid you in a kind of a script then. Yes, a 
script. And if the bank discounted them, then you

31:57.473 --> 32:02.518
all lost money on what you were being, the little 
bit you were being paid anyway. So the state was

32:03.173 --> 32:05.615
actually not paying in cash then? Oh, no. The 
outcome of it is we got a law passed. If you have read

32:13.904 --> 32:26.055
the papers about the way the legislature 
functions, we can't do that. We won't have the

32:26.376 --> 32:28.718
cash. We're on a cash-as-we-go basis in the state. 
And if the cash isn't going to be there, that

32:31.675 --> 32:35.859
appropriation will not be made. And that's the 
root out of that condition. Texas A&M wasn't the

32:40.904 --> 32:43.387
only one that was affected. Every institution, 
every college, every state institution had the

32:43.607 --> 32:49.673
same thing. I see. It wasn't picked on A&M. Did the 
state ever pay off on that script? Oh, yes. They

32:58.663 --> 32:59.944
picked it all up. How long did they pay you in that? 
Do you remember? No, I don't. What was it, a year or

33:03.691 --> 33:05.533
six months? I really don't know. I'd say at least a 
year, but I really don't know. I can't. Do you

33:10.078 --> 33:12.981
remember, you don't have any idea what year this 
was they were doing this? No, about 32, 33,

33:13.301 --> 33:15.984
somewhere in there. I see. Did, was there more, 
were there fewer or less students coming to

33:18.687 --> 33:23.833
school? There were fewer. They didn't have money 
enough. Of course, what boys came, A lot of them had

33:30.232 --> 33:31.593
to work. I could get a boy to push a lawnmower over my 
lawn for two bucks. In other words, the labor pay

33:37.859 --> 33:42.924
scales were almost non-existent.

33:46.268 --> 33:52.133
Is there anything before we go on past the end to 
the, you said you went to work for the Extension or

33:46.268 --> 33:52.133
Experiment Station? Extension. The Extension 
Service. Is there anything about that previous to

33:56.337 --> 34:08.108
that time you'd like to comment on, any 
experiences, any people you'd like to talk about

33:56.337 --> 34:08.108
that are possibly any of the presidents that I have 
listed here that maybe you had experiences with?

34:08.308 --> 34:11.992
Well, as I said, it's rather interesting. When I 
came here, Harrington had been president. They

34:17.137 --> 34:23.543
had a strike, and after some of those students' 
strike, he was benched. He was a director of the

34:24.350 --> 34:29.296
experiment station and raised to the president. 
Well, let's see what that is.

34:36.544 --> 34:37.465
Here in 1905.

34:40.848 --> 34:49.378
And

34:40.848 --> 34:49.378
when I came, he had been set down as a result of that 
strike and given his job as the director of the

34:50.472 --> 34:55.598
Experiment Station again.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.544
And of course, I knew him. Believe it or not, he was 
reared in Starkville, Mississippi. And I knew him

35:05.428 --> 35:08.552
and his folks when I came here. So he was

35:08.732 --> 35:15.940
rather courtly sort of a fellow and very definite 
in his opinions. It's one of the things that caused

35:21.648 --> 35:23.611
him his trouble. A man in that position as 
president can't be too definite in his opinions.

35:31.401 --> 35:34.826
But if he is, he don't want people to think it. But so 
I accept the fact that he was a very affable man. I

35:42.497 --> 35:43.338
liked him. That's about as far as I could go. But 
Milner came here. He came here before I did. He came

35:52.723 --> 35:53.704
in 1908. I came in 1911, February of 11. One of the 
first men I met on the campus after I got through the

35:58.871 --> 36:12.048
official thing with Blake and his crew and the 
bunch down at the Shirley was I ran into him on the

35:58.871 --> 36:12.048
campus, and he stopped and talked to me. Of course, 
in that day and time, You knew everyone on the

36:16.417 --> 36:18.179
campus.

36:21.442 --> 36:30.670
And he stopped and talked to me, and I was pretty 
well impressed with it. And the more longer I knew

36:30.690 --> 36:35.435
him, the more impressed I was with him. Now, he was 
not a scholar,

36:36.656 --> 36:44.483
but he brought in to the policy of the institution

36:45.256 --> 37:02.082
a statement that still rides with you, and that is 
that no boy who earnestly wants an education will

36:45.256 --> 37:02.082
be turned away. And it's still that way. The 
administrative bunch would go out of their way to

37:10.568 --> 37:16.753
help a boy today that is earnestly wanting an 
education. And it didn't help. A boy failed a

37:22.358 --> 37:25.021
course, well, he's not doing any good. Kick him out 
of college. Oh, no, not with Milner.

37:32.828 --> 37:34.229
Let him take it over next year. But you know, Milner 
would not tolerate

37:41.737 --> 37:51.508
a moving school of students from the institution

37:41.737 --> 37:51.508
for scholastic inefficiencies. He just wouldn't 
stand it. And

37:55.313 --> 38:09.870
they had a strike down here in 1912,

37:55.313 --> 38:09.870
I guess it was,

37:55.313 --> 38:09.870
and it broke his heart.

38:12.972 --> 38:27.888
and he retired saying that if he had no more 
influence over the boys then that he wouldn't stay

38:12.972 --> 38:27.888
here and he left with that with a you might say a 
broken heart. Do you have any idea what the strike

38:27.908 --> 38:29.951
was about? Hazing. Hazing and he tried to stop it. 
He not only tried to stop it but he tried to to work

38:41.963 --> 38:47.811
around it so that there'd be no trouble. He tried to 
compromise all the way through so that everybody

38:47.851 --> 38:58.205
would be happy, but it wasn't to be. How about after 
that? Do you remember? Charles Periot went in as

39:03.310 --> 39:11.764
acting president, and he's a rather interesting 
little fellow. He was originally a professor of

39:11.784 --> 39:16.171
mathematics, and I think he still taught at this 
time.

39:18.915 --> 39:22.922
He actually ran the institution's scholastic 
work. And if you had any objection, there's one

39:25.466 --> 39:29.933
thing that stands. Put it in writing. Any 
proposition you had that involved the

39:33.128 --> 39:43.244
institution that you dealt with Perea, you 
submitted it in writing. You wouldn't consider it

39:43.264 --> 39:44.906
otherwise.

39:47.750 --> 40:00.350
But somewhere down in the mix up here, while he 
was...

39:47.750 --> 40:00.350
Milner was here, the Nassau band. 1912, I believe. 
And there was a building, the Presence Visa Hall.

40:14.977 --> 40:24.126
And they had some tin shacks

40:14.977 --> 40:24.126
over there that they were eating in.

40:27.149 --> 40:32.093
And the students, every Friday, every Saturday 
night, but have a bass in the mess hall.

40:38.217 --> 40:39.639
And it is quite a bass. You would have enjoyed it 
yourself.

40:46.589 --> 41:01.489
And I was sitting next to Pereira one night, and he 
had

40:46.589 --> 41:01.489
an election for the presidency of the college.

41:02.768 --> 41:09.177
Cesar Horn was

41:02.768 --> 41:09.177
acting chairman, I believe. I'm not too sure 
whether he or Ray Dixon was acting chairman.

41:15.605 --> 41:20.092
And Red Wayne Palmer, he's a student now.

41:23.316 --> 41:24.558
Faribault Kincheloe.

41:31.167 --> 41:32.168
And a couple more. was nominated for president of 
the institution.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.825
I was trying to think of one of them that was a 
half-wit. I wouldn't mention his name, so I better

41:42.845 --> 41:49.355
let it ride, because of the fact that his people 
were pretty famous in the state.

41:52.700 --> 41:58.229
And the speeches that bunch made, Perea said, oh, 
he didn't like to rupture himself laughing.

42:01.254 --> 42:02.155
But... That's about all the entertainment we had 
was some fool thing like that.
