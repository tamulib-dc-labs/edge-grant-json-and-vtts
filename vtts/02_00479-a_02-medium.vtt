WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:09.428
It was something that was always in the 
background, but it never really bothered me very

00:01.837 --> 00:09.428
much. Now, some people have said that there's sort 
of a ring-knockers club with West Pointers, and as

00:09.788 --> 00:17.218
far as promotions are concerned, they always look 
for their own. What do you think about that? Is

00:19.402 --> 00:20.523
there sort of a club? Do you move up the ladder of 
success faster if you're a West Pointer, or

00:20.563 --> 00:28.735
doesn't it make any difference? I think overall 
that's true. I really do. I hate to say it. But I

00:34.437 --> 00:39.382
think overall, in a general statement, I believe 
that's correct.

00:42.004 --> 00:50.492
Specifically, and on a case-by-case basis, why 
there's plenty of good evidence that says that

00:42.004 --> 00:50.492
that's not the case. But I think when you look at it 
as a whole, I believe it would be. It's probably...

01:01.540 --> 01:29.202
working there was probably a period right after 
World War II and for many years thereafter when we

01:01.540 --> 01:29.202
had so many integrated officers into the regular 
army such as myself that were given the

01:01.540 --> 01:29.202
opportunity to integrate into the regular army 
that there was a preponderance then of officers

01:01.540 --> 01:29.202
both senior and junior in the regular 
establishment who were not West Pointers.

01:37.105 --> 01:45.705
We may be gradually working to the point now where 
that percentage is not as big as it was right after

01:37.105 --> 01:45.705
World War II

02:12.027 --> 02:17.592
When you were in the Corps of Cadets, did you hold a 
position of leadership? No, no I was not. I sure

02:22.996 --> 02:24.137
wasn't. Why do you think that was? Later you did so 
well in the military. I don't really know. I guess

02:29.442 --> 02:41.072
because

02:29.442 --> 02:41.072
maybe I missed a lot by being in the athletics in the 
football squad every fall. And I was not a Ross

02:50.268 --> 03:02.584
volunteer and well I just don't really know and it 
never never really bothered me particularly. I

03:02.604 --> 03:12.257
felt I didn't feel any disappointment about it. 
Did you feel that the Corps had any impact on you for

03:12.423 --> 03:20.592
later becoming a general officer? No, I don't 
think so, no. So you don't think it affected you one

03:23.636 --> 03:27.160
way or the other as far as becoming a leader? No, I 
don't think so.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.827
Sure don't. What about the idea that some 
journalists state that there's a military

03:33.847 --> 03:40.455
mentality that there's a way that the military 
does something and then there's a way that

03:40.807 --> 03:49.561
businessmen do things. Do you believe in the 
military mentality? No, I don't. I think that's a

03:52.685 --> 04:08.029
fallacy and that's just a snap phrase or a 
catchphrase that somebody has invented, much

03:52.685 --> 04:08.029
like this concept that was that was attributed to 
General Eisenhower of the military industrial

04:09.764 --> 04:14.431
complex. He did make a statement about that in a 
speech, but there's really no such thing as a

04:15.192 --> 04:24.365
military industrial complex. I made several 
speeches on that subject during my military

04:25.146 --> 04:31.755
career and I think General Eisenhower, I've read 
some things about his speech where he mentioned

04:33.153 --> 04:54.553
that he didn't write that speech, it was written 
for him, and people say that he never read it prior

04:33.153 --> 04:54.553
to delivering it, or he never would have mentioned 
the phrase military.

05:03.764 --> 05:09.470
back there hoovering over the country, i.e. the 
military industrial complex that dictates what

05:09.490 --> 05:18.080
weapon systems we'll buy and how many and how much 
and so forth. And I think that's just a bunch of

05:18.901 --> 05:23.085
crap, really. I don't put any belief in it at all, 
because if there was, I was certainly a part of it.

05:33.582 --> 05:34.844
of being a part of it. Because in my last command at 
the Defense Personnel Support Center, which was a

05:35.846 --> 05:57.261
joint staff organization that was staffed, I had 
Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps officers,

05:35.846 --> 05:57.261
and we had worldwide responsibility for all of the 
clothing, all of

06:00.785 --> 06:05.130
the medical and dental for all the armed forces. 
And I had it during the Vietnam period and the

06:06.412 --> 06:24.415
Vietnam build-up period and

06:06.412 --> 06:24.415
in fiscal year 66 my total budget was 3.2 billion in 
that one command. And the subsistence part of it,

06:25.896 --> 06:28.800
the food part of it, was 1.3 billion, and the 
clothing was about 1.1. And if there ever was an

06:36.744 --> 06:59.209
opportunity for the military industrial 
complex, the Burlington Mills, the J.P. Stevens,

06:36.744 --> 06:59.209
the big weaving companies, and Hart, Schaffner, 
and Marks, the big fabricating companies, to have

06:36.744 --> 06:59.209
functioned, I certainly would have been 
knowledgeable of it and had a part of it. And just

06:59.813 --> 07:11.528
the opposite was the case because during that time 
the whole country was in the throes of a very, very

06:59.813 --> 07:11.528
good business boom. Business was booming and 
civilian business was booming and Johnson was

07:11.548 --> 07:23.644
trying to fight the war and to have guns and butter 
too. And we couldn't get covered. We'd go out, our

07:27.112 --> 07:36.582
procurement officers would go out with a 
procurement to buy clothing, buy Air Force

07:27.112 --> 07:36.582
clothing or Army clothing, and nobody would bid on 
it. Nobody would bid on it. So what did we have to do?

07:41.367 --> 07:51.437
Finally, after talking to the DOD and everybody, 
they said, look, we're probably going to have to

07:41.367 --> 07:51.437
implement the War Powers Act of directed orders, 
directed procurement. And during World War II,

07:57.831 --> 08:21.593
Congress passed a law which said that the 
military, in wartime necessity, could place

07:57.831 --> 08:21.593
orders directly upon American industry for them 
to produce military supplies and equipment for

07:57.831 --> 08:21.593
the war effort and that the Department of Commerce 
would be the government agency to adjudicate any

08:22.113 --> 08:40.206
claims or disputes arising between the military 
and industry, and that the prices that we would

08:40.321 --> 08:53.715
would pay for these directed orders and supplies 
would be that which was adjudicated to be fair

08:40.321 --> 08:53.715
market value by the Department of Commerce and so 
on and so forth. And there was regulations set

08:53.735 --> 09:00.743
forth about if you place an order on a company, they 
had 30 days to appeal and so forth. So they told me

09:01.584 --> 09:07.931
one day, they said, look, I think we're going to 
have to use this wartime act. They said, we've

09:07.951 --> 09:10.193
never used it before. And I think it was used one 
time in World War II, but everybody in World War II

09:10.730 --> 09:20.802
was patriotic and everybody wanted to do their 
share. So I got the go-ahead from the DOD one Friday

09:21.923 --> 09:26.149
afternoon. So I called all our clothing and 
equipment people in and procurement people. I

09:33.257 --> 09:37.362
said, look, we've got three or four million Air 
Force and Army uniforms and Marine and everything

09:39.215 --> 09:47.348
and Navy to buy here and we haven't got coverage on. 
I said let's figure out and we know who the

09:47.428 --> 09:52.116
potential suppliers are. Let's parcel it out and 
prepare the telegrams for my signature and we'll

09:52.737 --> 10:00.750
start sending them out tonight. And by Monday 
morning, they worked all weekend and we sent out,

10:01.591 --> 10:11.384
oh, about 190 to 200 telegrams to industry. Said, 
we are hereby, under the War Powers Act of 1941, you

10:11.404 --> 10:23.641
are hereby directed to produce 250,000 of this and 
300,000

10:11.404 --> 10:23.641
of that. Well, you can imagine the hue and cry that 
resulted on Monday and Tuesday. why the goddamn

10:29.587 --> 10:41.038
people in industry are flying in and driving in and 
they're congressmen and everything and we're

10:29.587 --> 10:41.038
just saying we're sorry there's a war going on now 
you do it. You have 30 days to appeal if you don't

10:42.079 --> 10:54.290
want to do it and the Department of Commerce will 
adjudicate it and only two or three of them

10:42.079 --> 10:54.290
appealed it. Every goddamn one of them took it and 
we used it We used it hundreds of times during

10:59.624 --> 11:02.608
Vietnam. Yeah. We directed them to do it. Just sent 
them a damn telegram. You are hereby directed to

11:09.978 --> 11:12.522
produce this. And we told them how much we were 
paying for it and everything. And it was a fair

11:15.826 --> 11:17.088
market. They all made money. They all made money by 
it, but they just didn't want to interrupt their

11:19.013 --> 11:23.498
civilian business. They said, well, we'll lose 
all our civilian business. I said, well, that's

11:27.101 --> 11:28.162
fine. What are the guys going to Vietnam going to 
wear? What are they going to wear? And what are we

11:33.067 --> 11:35.990
going to do for this and for that? So we didn't have 
any problem. But if there was a

11:40.775 --> 11:48.683
military-industrial complex, that would 
certainly have been a good place for it to come

11:40.775 --> 11:48.683
forth. There wasn't any. So I think- So you think 
the whole idea of the military industrial complex

11:52.730 --> 12:00.640
and military mentality are both a myth? They're a 
myth. They certainly are. I think they're a myth.

12:04.885 --> 12:06.086
Okay. Now let's start talking about when you 
graduated. Did you have firm plans? Did you get a

12:10.852 --> 12:12.033
job? Did you interview for jobs or did you want to go 
into the military? After I didn't make the Army Air

12:14.817 --> 12:18.501
Corps. I then went to Root. I was already, I already 
knew how to fly. And I was, I wanted to go to work for a

12:24.560 --> 12:28.806
major oil company and I did. I had one interview and 
got a job and reported out to- This is 1934. This is

12:36.076 --> 12:37.698
1934. I reported in September 1934 to the Gulf 
after division off by car down to Crane, 35 miles

12:46.780 --> 12:51.507
south of Odessa. Not even a railroad in Crane 
County. And I went to work down there in a

12:54.551 --> 12:56.955
connection gang. And I'm making 70 cents an hour. 
Is that what you were making? Yeah, 70 cents an

13:01.821 --> 13:03.103
hour. Did any of your other colleagues get jobs? 
Yes. Or were there very few jobs? No, I think all of,

13:07.790 --> 13:12.737
best of my knowledge, all of the All of the P.E. guys 
got jobs. Most of them went to work for Humble,

13:18.501 --> 13:21.584
which is now Exxon. I had sort of wanted to go to work 
for Humble, and I asked for an interview. One of our

13:29.574 --> 13:38.505
assistant professors was a former Humble guy, the 
little shrimp, and he didn't like me for some

13:29.574 --> 13:38.505
reason or another. But I didn't get the invitation 
to come to Houston for an interview and I think it

13:39.599 --> 13:46.868
was because of him. But anyway, I was happy to work 
with Gov. They had a division office here in Fort

13:52.815 --> 14:02.828
Worth and I had met through my father one of the guys 
there, one of the superintendents there. And Gov

14:04.189 --> 14:08.695
was strong in West Texas and I started to lean to 
West Texas. So I was just thrilled to death to go to

14:09.248 --> 14:12.471
work for golf. And there were six of us that 
reported out there, six young college graduates.

14:19.158 --> 14:19.899
There was... Were you all A&M? No, no, I was the only 
A&M. Oh, okay, that's what I figured. There was one

14:25.424 --> 14:30.969
from the Rolla School of Mines that later, that 
lived with me out there. We lived in bunk houses. In

14:33.292 --> 14:34.353
other words, Missouri. Yeah, in Missouri, Rolla, 
Missouri. And another one from the University of

14:37.278 --> 14:40.161
Pittsburgh. His family was friends of the 
Mellons, the principal owners of Goff. Oh, there

14:47.609 --> 14:49.591
was another Aggie, yeah. Del Brockett, E.D. 
Brockett. And I'll tell you a little story about

14:53.234 --> 14:55.877
Del. And you really ought to interview Del 
Brockett. He never became a flag officer, but he

15:02.224 --> 15:05.547
was a colonel. And a combat officer. How do you 
spell his name? Brockett. E-D is initials.

15:11.684 --> 15:14.248
B-R-O-C-K-E-T-T.

15:16.030 --> 15:18.574
If you interview anybody, you ought to interview 
him. Because Adele Brockett was a P.E. And he was in

15:24.462 --> 15:26.725
that group. And we both worked in the same 
connection gang. And I tell this story. Adele

15:31.432 --> 15:32.513
probably... would be mad as hell, me tellin', he 
probably wouldn't subscribe to it. But I,

15:37.241 --> 15:59.023
whenever we were doin' a real tough job, like 
layin' four-inch pipe and buckin' it with chain

15:37.241 --> 15:59.023
tongs and pipe tongs, well, the gang foreman 
would, you know, say, get the tongs and get that,

15:37.241 --> 15:59.023
and Del would always get the lazy board or the dope 
bucket, some easy job, see? and whenever we were

15:59.948 --> 16:14.391
working in a cellar of a well or something, I was 
always among the first guys to get down in the muck

15:59.948 --> 16:14.391
and get dirty and Del would do his share, but his 
would be a cleaner job, see. Well, Del Brockett

16:14.912 --> 16:19.880
later became the chairman of the board of Gulf Oil. 
That's why you ought to interview him. E.D.

16:23.565 --> 16:27.171
Brockett, he's a distinguished alumni, has given 
fifty or sixty thousand dollars, and E.D.

16:31.259 --> 16:34.362
Brockett, Del Brockett, he lives now in Baton 
Rouge. A hell of a nice guy. I really think a lot of

16:37.145 --> 16:38.547
him. But he was, he became the chairman of the board 
of Gulf Oil. And I think his salary, according to

16:44.033 --> 16:51.741
poop I used to read in annual reports and 
everything, I think his remuneration his last

16:53.628 --> 17:05.346
year was about $300,000 salary and another two or 
three hundred in bonuses and incentives and so

16:53.628 --> 17:05.346
forth. So Dell is a wealthy man. I don't know how 
many thousands of shares of Gulf stock he has now.

17:12.637 --> 17:17.284
Probably has a retirement of 150 or 200,000 a year. 
Is he retired now? Yeah, he's retired now. So, you

17:21.252 --> 17:23.895
really ought to interview Dale Brockett. God 
almighty, he had a brilliant combat record in the

17:23.915 --> 17:28.660
South Pacific. He commanded a combat engineer 
battalion, I think later a regiment. He was a full

17:36.388 --> 17:47.040
colonel and I'm sure you could get a lot of good 
comments and narrative from him about

17:50.210 --> 18:02.529
what it takes and how he approached what he did to 
become the titular head of about the fifth or sixth

17:50.210 --> 18:02.529
largest oil company in the world.

18:05.374 --> 18:14.368
Anyway, I was happy to go down there to Crane and I 
really enjoyed every minute of it there. We worked

18:14.388 --> 18:17.753
in this connection gang just like commonly

18:20.990 --> 18:29.744
one day they, Adele was assigned to the 
engineering department and they told me to report

18:20.990 --> 18:29.744
to the drilling department. I worked out on the 
deep test. They had a rotary rig running and

18:32.208 --> 18:40.682
drilling a deep well, which we later got the 
world's record at that time. We drilled to 12,786

18:49.525 --> 18:56.114
Dell was in the engineering department taking 
bottom hole pressures and things like that.

18:58.838 --> 19:06.168
But this group of six all went on and worked their 
whole careers with Gulf except me. I

19:07.550 --> 19:17.203
worked about three years there

19:07.550 --> 19:17.203
and

19:19.883 --> 19:40.917
One day, one of the superintendents of Gulf that I 
had become acquainted with, and he liked me, he

19:19.883 --> 19:40.917
said, you know, he said, I had a call here the other 
day from a supply house that we do a lot of business

19:19.883 --> 19:40.917
with, wanting to know if we had an engineer that 
would like to work for them. And he said, it's a

19:42.980 --> 19:47.427
pretty good thing, monetarily, he said, Anybody 
that would probably make more money quicker

19:47.592 --> 20:00.286
working for a supply house as a sales engineer than 
they would working for Gulf and coming up through

19:47.592 --> 20:00.286
the ladder through the years. He says, would you be 
interested? And I said, well, I might be, yeah. So

20:06.754 --> 20:09.397
two, three days after that, they called me. And 
wanted to know if I could come down to Beaumont for

20:10.878 --> 20:16.705
an interview with Norville Wilder Supply 
Company. So I did, and to make a long story short, I

20:17.815 --> 20:22.960
went to work for him in the Houston office. And I was 
helping sell pumping units and designing for sale

20:24.202 --> 20:43.682
little reciprocating skid mounted gasoline 
engine driven pumps for gathering systems for

20:24.202 --> 20:43.682
pipelines and so forth. So I went to work for Norval 
Wilder. And while I was working for them there in

20:48.089 --> 20:56.019
Houston after about eight or nine months, I had a 
lot of good friends in the Shell. And I was

20:57.701 --> 21:16.645
approached one day and they said, look, we know 
you're an engineer and we're trying to put

20:57.701 --> 21:16.645
together a task force here, a super duper task 
force to evaluate oil properties because Shell is

20:57.701 --> 21:16.645
going to expand its production through 
acquisition. And would you be interested? I said,

21:19.702 --> 21:20.843
well, I don't know. I haven't been working here for 
a while or very long. I've got a good job and I like

21:24.867 --> 21:26.789
it. I just got married. And they said, well, this is 
really going to be an opportunity. They said,

21:31.793 --> 21:41.583
we're bringing a world-renowned geologist over 
from The Hague that will teach this group the

21:31.793 --> 21:41.583
techniques and so forth. The more they talked 
about it, the more exotic it sounded. So I took the

21:47.067 --> 21:53.533
job and went to work there in the top floor of the 
Shell Building in Houston. About eight or ten

21:54.874 --> 22:16.112
engineers and they brought this little Swiss, Dr. 
Wilhelm from The Hague, that he was absolutely a

21:54.874 --> 22:16.112
genius and about his theories on subsurface 
analysis to analyze existing oil fields and

21:54.874 --> 22:16.112
structures as to how much oil was going to be 
recovered from them and what the value was and what

22:16.312 --> 22:22.322
the future value would be. Shell had devised 
certain guidelines of they wouldn't look at a

22:23.344 --> 22:38.691
property unless it would show an average payout of 
such and such and the average annual profit would

22:23.344 --> 22:38.691
be at least 22% or something like that. So for about 
three months, we just kind of went and had a

22:39.751 --> 22:57.210
super-duper postgraduate course in subsurface 
analysis and in Schlumberger law of

22:39.751 --> 22:57.210
interpretation and correlation and some other 
exotic theories. And then, meanwhile, the Land

22:58.171 --> 23:06.180
Department of Shell was getting all these pieces 
of

23:14.733 --> 23:22.023
And Shell and the Land Department would submit 
this lease down to this task group for our

23:14.733 --> 23:22.023
recommendations. And then Wilhelm would parcel 
it out to us. And we'd analyze it and write a report

23:25.667 --> 23:31.034
on what our analysis was. And based on that, Shell 
would either buy or not buy the properties. And it

23:37.302 --> 23:39.105
just functioned beautifully. One of the guys that 
was there was a famous West Point graduate and

23:44.838 --> 24:01.479
all-American football player, Johnny Merle, who 
was cashiered out of the Army because of an alleged

23:44.838 --> 24:01.479
rape of a socialite at Fort San Houston in San 
Antonio. And he was, he was kind of a, he wasn't a

24:02.360 --> 24:06.345
good guy. He was kind of a rogue, but a very, very 
brilliant guy and had been out of the service about

24:15.466 --> 24:19.751
three years and had worked for Shell. And it was 
really brilliant. And he later became the head of

24:22.254 --> 24:36.371
McNaughton and Degalia Consulting Outfit in 
Dallas, which is the most famous oil consulting

24:22.254 --> 24:36.371
firm in the world. Johnny Merle was, he's, I think 
he's, no, he's not still the head of it. There's

24:42.178 --> 24:44.140
another ex-Aggie the head of it. But Johnny Merle 
was in this group there, this evaluation group.

24:49.685 --> 24:59.741
And of course I was intrigued by knowing him and 
learning about all his days at West Point when he

24:49.685 --> 24:59.741
was an all-American halfback. But he was really a 
rogue. Were you working for Shell then? I worked

25:05.270 --> 25:07.053
for Shell then, yeah. Well, this thing functioned 
like a house of fire for about a year. And then

25:12.875 --> 25:18.723
Norval Wilder was going to expand and go into West 
Texas and build some stores. And they contacted me

25:19.224 --> 25:24.851
and said, look, you want to come back to work for us? 
And we want you to go out to Midland and be our

25:25.893 --> 25:32.742
division manager and build a couple of stores in 
some of the new fields. And this more or less gave me

25:32.842 --> 25:36.267
a blank check. So I said, yeah, I will. I said, I've 
learned about all I can learn here in this hotshot

25:38.453 --> 25:43.079
group. And it was really fascinating. Every day 
was just like a joy to go to work because there's

25:44.801 --> 25:49.427
something new every day. And I got a lot of personal 
satisfaction out of it. So I went back out to West

25:54.273 --> 26:06.608
Texas and set myself up in Midland and built a store 
in Monahans for Norwood Wilder, which is west of

25:54.273 --> 26:06.608
Midland, and worked there. got an interest in an 
airplane, a little yellow bomber. We call it the

26:14.731 --> 26:17.935
yellow peril, a little Piper Cub. Five of us formed 
a flying club and bought it. One of them was a former

26:22.442 --> 26:31.053
Navy carrier pilot, and he polished everybody's 
flying skills up on it. And so this was late in 1940.

26:37.452 --> 26:41.977
and we went happily along there for six or seven 
months. And lo and behold, one day I landed the

26:43.199 --> 26:47.964
plane at Midland, at the Midland Airport. It was a 
small army detachment for refueling and for

26:49.406 --> 26:58.357
weather gathering purposes. There was a couple of 
sergeants, a couple of master sergeants, and five

26:58.397 --> 27:03.763
or six other enlisted men. the planes from 
Randolph and Kelly would come through on cross

27:04.317 --> 27:12.627
country and they'd stop there for refueling 
before they went on to El Paso. And they ran a little

27:13.928 --> 27:16.071
weather station too. And I'd been up to Yoakum 
County in the Piper Cub and we had these Air Force

27:17.232 --> 27:32.130
guys, Air Corps guys kind of looking after our 
plane and we for that we This Navy pilot taught a

27:32.482 --> 27:36.227
couple of them to fly. And they'd polish our plane 
up, and they'd give us safety wire. Of course, they

27:40.312 --> 27:43.997
had a little spare part, and they'd give us spark 
plugs. God knows how much free Army Air Corps stuff

27:44.617 --> 27:49.724
we got from them. Well, anyway, I was taxiing. I'd 
been up to Yoakum County and was taxiing up to our

27:52.327 --> 27:55.551
little hangar. The sergeant was running across 
the field waving a yellow piece of paper.

28:02.688 --> 28:06.453
He said, I hadn't even cut the switch on the plane 
yet. He hollered, he said, I didn't know you were a

28:06.953 --> 28:09.917
reserve officer. I said, yeah. So I cut the switch 
and I said, what the hell's cutting? He said, I got a

28:15.605 --> 28:21.412
Twix for you over our weather network from 
Washington. I said, well, who's it signed by? He

28:23.314 --> 28:26.659
said, well, it's signed by somebody named 
Gregory. He said... I said, who is that? He said, I

28:28.945 --> 28:32.330
don't know, but he must be a high ranking guy. He 
wouldn't be signing messages. So asking me would I

28:35.375 --> 28:46.875
come on duty for one year to help in the activation 
and design of military pipeline companies. Now at

28:49.259 --> 28:52.945
this time, had you been going to any reserve 
meetings? I hadn't been going to any meetings, but

28:53.093 --> 28:56.899
I had gone to camp. I'd gone to camp every year since 
I graduated. So a two-week camp in the summer?

29:02.910 --> 29:03.911
Yeah, a two-week camp. And what rank were you by 
then? I was first lieutenant. First lieutenant,

29:08.920 --> 29:10.463
sure was. First lieutenant in the Field Artillery 
Reserve and my last camp had been at Fort D.A.

29:19.011 --> 29:20.513
Russell in Marfa, Texas. It was a 105 millimeter 
howitzer outfit down there that I was assigned to.

29:27.740 --> 29:31.244
Artillery outfit, because I was artillery, field 
artillery reserve. And it turns out that Gregory

29:32.586 --> 29:37.451
was a quartermaster general in Washington. And 
asking me would I come on duty for one year to help

29:38.552 --> 29:46.641
design and buy the equipment and for this military 
pipeline company, which was a new concept of a

29:47.498 --> 30:14.434
military organization to lay pipelines so that we 
could push forward by pipeline diesel fuel and

29:47.498 --> 30:14.434
gasoline for tanks and vehicles and make it easier 
to supply and support armored columns and so

29:47.498 --> 30:14.434
forth. And this was a quick laying, a Victaulic 
couple pipeline you lay right on top of the ground.

30:22.495 --> 30:23.777
You lay it real fast. So it... Is it pretty 
lightweight pipe? Not real lightweight. No, it's

30:32.490 --> 30:33.672
steel pipe. It's not aluminum, it's steel pipe. 
No, it weighs, the four inch I guess, it weighs

30:37.058 --> 30:40.523
about Mmm, three pounds per foot.

30:47.345 --> 30:51.391
Well anyway... And so it was considered the idea, 
what was the idea behind it? Could you tell me a

30:51.411 --> 30:52.814
little bit about that? Why did they want to do that 
instead of have, have gasoline trucks? Because

30:57.160 --> 31:02.128
this was much better than having gasoline trucks. 
It would give you a, a logistic line of support more

31:08.228 --> 31:12.213
dependable than a vehicle, which uses fuel as 
well. And it's most efficient. It's the most

31:16.960 --> 31:22.747
efficient way to move liquid products of anything 
is by pipeline. And so I was really, I was just

31:24.450 --> 31:29.156
shocked. Hell, I just built a house in Midland, my 
wife is pregnant. And I had a good job and of course

31:33.777 --> 31:38.885
the war was coming, you could see that. This was in 
December 1940.

31:46.676 --> 31:47.978
Late December 1940. I guess it was around 
Christmas or may have been between Christmas and

31:49.300 --> 31:58.454
New Year's because I remember it was cold out there 
in West Texas then.

32:00.898 --> 32:01.118
And I The sergeant said, you can send an answerer 
back over the net. He said, I can put it on the

32:06.116 --> 32:08.038
teletype for you. I said, well, hell, I can't 
answer it today. I've got to think about this. I've

32:13.124 --> 32:14.546
got to talk to my company. So we pondered about it. 
And I was sure that we were going to be involved in

32:17.709 --> 32:27.500
the war, because we were already, you know, we had 
to draft. And we were already mobilizing and

32:27.560 --> 32:31.965
already in Lend-Lease.

32:34.207 --> 32:44.877
So I talked to my Lip Norville, whose office was 
here in Fort Worth, and told him what the telegram

32:34.207 --> 32:44.877
that I've got. Asked me to come on duty for a year. He 
said, well, why don't you go ahead? And he said,

32:50.202 --> 32:55.147
we'll pay the difference between your salary and 
first lieutenant. We'll. Really? Yeah. And we'll

32:57.789 --> 32:58.590
pay. Gee whiz. How nice. We'll pay in the social 
security for you. We'll pay into Social Security

33:04.042 --> 33:07.067
for you. And he said, I presume they'll pay your 
travel and move your wife up to Washington, won't

33:07.087 --> 33:13.378
they? I said, well, I guess they will. I know 
they'll pay my travel. He said, well, if they won't

33:17.524 --> 33:23.855
pay for Sue going up there, we'll pay for her going 
up there. And they were real nice about it. No

33:26.079 --> 33:26.860
kidding. So about a week or 10 days later, I went out 
to the airport and I said, let's send an answer to

33:27.700 --> 33:34.928
this message. So I did and told them I would. And so 
early in January, I got back a reply from ordering

33:39.214 --> 33:57.555
me to go to the hospital in El Paso, William 
Beaumont General Hospital, for a final type

33:39.214 --> 33:57.555
physical, which I did. in which I passed and they 
sent it on to Horsman. Then about three weeks after

34:01.825 --> 34:08.254
that I flew the Piper Cub out there to El Paso. 
Bucked headwinds all the way, took about four

34:08.274 --> 34:19.670
hours to fly that, no about three hours to fly that 
300 odd miles to El Paso. In about three weeks, two

34:21.172 --> 34:24.657
or three weeks after that I got orders. directing 
me to report to Washington on the 8th of March.

34:33.129 --> 34:34.551
So that started off. I drove up there and reported. 
My wife came on up in about two weeks. Our son was

34:40.238 --> 34:43.002
born in May.

34:46.167 --> 34:52.095
There were about six other five, five other 
patrols of engineers they had brought on duty. And

34:58.874 --> 35:10.691
we, we all had, we all had had some experience with 
pipeline gathering systems and pumps, so

34:58.874 --> 35:10.691
everybody was pretty well zeroed in on it. And we 
all had about the same idea as, oh hell, it didn't

35:11.833 --> 35:17.902
take us but about six weeks. We, we had worked out a 
table of equipment And what we felt would be that

35:22.248 --> 35:35.840
the capabilities of an organization of this size 
made up a list of materials which was approved very

35:22.248 --> 35:35.840
quickly to buy six sets of it. And in about four 
months time, the stuff started rolling in to Fort

35:37.522 --> 35:44.268
Belvoir, Virginia, right there. Near 
Washington. Well, after we got this thing

35:47.111 --> 35:49.673
launched, Well, I then had nothing further to do 
with the Military Pipeline Company. I later, in

35:56.535 --> 36:04.629
later life, later service, had a lot to do with it in 
Japan after the war. But during World War II then, I

36:09.312 --> 36:20.983
hadn't gotten along so well there in the staff 
capacity that Christ, they wouldn't let me go out

36:09.312 --> 36:20.983
to Belvoir to help run the thing after we had given 
birth to it. There's another guy and I that they

36:21.683 --> 36:32.513
kept back there, and we were kept in planning and

36:21.683 --> 36:32.513
other logistic assignments. Well, after these 
four months, were you eager to get back to the

36:32.533 --> 36:36.417
civilian job then? Well I was on duty for a year see 
and I was ordered to duty for a year and lo and behold

36:36.802 --> 36:49.715
in December the 7th Pearl Harbor came and that had 
ended the year. I was in for the duration then. Yes I

36:53.960 --> 36:58.724
was anxious but they said well no can't let you off 
now. You can get off when your year is up but before

36:59.685 --> 37:02.168
that

37:06.485 --> 37:09.868
So that's how it all started. And

37:09.928 --> 37:22.641
I guess if I had it to do over, I don't believe I would 
change the scenario any, really. Even after the

37:25.063 --> 37:34.753
war was over and I came back to civilian life, I had 
an opportunity to go to work for the Coleman

37:35.611 --> 37:40.517
Company that makes the lanterns and everything. I 
got very well acquainted with Sheldon Coleman.

37:44.622 --> 37:55.835
He's the chairman of the Coleman Company and he's 
the son of the old man Coleman whom I also met early

37:44.622 --> 37:55.835
in the war. I got really acquainted with those guys 
I guess through some of the extra effort in

38:03.269 --> 38:09.918
activities I engaged in, which I'm sure didn't 
hurt my career at all. But early in the war, about

38:10.840 --> 38:32.871
the time we were, no, early, long before we got in 
the war, when we were working on this military

38:10.840 --> 38:32.871
pipeline concept, I read some of these reports of 
the British fighting in Libya, and British

38:10.840 --> 38:32.871
armoured, and how they were moving their fuel, One 
thing that always intrigued me was they were

38:33.796 --> 38:47.556
always talking about making tea or heating bully 
beef and everything and they had really no little

38:33.796 --> 38:47.556
stove to do it with. And they would hollow out a 
little hole in the sand and kind of coop it up and put

38:49.059 --> 39:03.600
a little hole and pour some petrol in there and 
light it and then hold a pan or a container over it

38:49.059 --> 39:03.600
while it burned. to heat water to make tea or to heat 
a mess kit that had bully beef in it and stew.

39:13.239 --> 39:17.785
Whereas if they had a little stove, well it would 
have been a neat little thing. So I got the idea one

39:19.748 --> 39:26.798
day and I mentioned it to one of the research people 
there in the Quartermaster General's office. I

39:27.699 --> 39:31.765
said why don't we, why don't we build a, why don't we 
design a a little stove that armored units or that

39:32.656 --> 39:40.671
people in vehicles would have and they could cook a 
meal in the field. Even heat up combat rations, sea

39:41.753 --> 39:50.169
rations, or at least heat water to shave with or 
coffee. And this guy that I talked to, I forget who

39:51.812 --> 39:55.238
he was, He said, we've got a stove. He said, the 
mountain troops, and we had a few mountain troops.

40:03.830 --> 40:11.038
He said, they've got a little stove to melt the wax 
for skis, to melt ski wax, to put on skis. And I said,

40:12.299 --> 40:14.181
well, where is one of them? Have you seen one? He 
said, yeah. So he got one and showed it to me. And I

40:19.067 --> 40:21.910
said, well, hell, we could start with this thing. 
It was made by Coleman. So. What did it look like? It

40:27.601 --> 40:50.556
was a little small square container and had a 
little top and a little burner unit very similar to

40:27.601 --> 40:50.556
gasoline lantern and you pumped air into this 
little fount where the gasoline was and you then

40:27.601 --> 40:50.556
got a little pressurized vapor and you turned the 
burner on and lit it. So, I said, we could really

40:54.466 --> 41:08.057
make something here if we take this thing and 
design a container to carry it and let this

40:54.466 --> 41:08.057
container, this carrying case, be the container 
also to heat water in and stuff like that. A double

41:08.998 --> 41:10.219
purpose thing. So he said, well, this Coleman 
representative comes around here occasionally.

41:16.224 --> 41:17.385
I said, well, who is he? So he looked it up, and I 
called him up. I said, look, we've got a wild idea

41:21.649 --> 41:24.051
here. And I said, maybe you can do something. Maybe 
we can work something up. I had no charter to do

41:30.620 --> 41:33.104
anything like this. And I went to one of the senior 
officers in the plans or operations branch, and I

41:34.345 --> 41:46.160
told him, he said, well, we have no requirement for 
anything like that. And I said, well, I know we

41:46.440 --> 41:53.329
don't, but someday we might have a requirement, or 
maybe we ought to develop a requirement for it. So

41:55.216 --> 42:01.746
the Coleman guy came, and I told him what my idea 
was, and we discussed it. And he said, well, let us

42:02.166 --> 42:04.350
play around with it a little bit. So he apparently 
passed the information on out to Wichita, to their

42:05.631 --> 42:11.420
home office. Two, three days, a young Sheldon 
Coleman called me. The old man was still alive then

42:17.048 --> 42:19.452
and running the company. And he said, we're 
intrigued by your idea here of a little military

42:21.203 --> 42:26.208
one-burner stove. And we believe that we can do 
something with it and make a container, a carrying

42:28.110 --> 42:50.333
case out of aluminum that would serve as a 
container and also serve as something that you

42:28.110 --> 42:50.333
could heat water in, particularly the top of it, 
because the bottom might get the smell of gasoline

42:28.110 --> 42:50.333
a little bit with the fount sitting on it. And I 
said, well, the brass around here says we don't

42:52.388 --> 43:03.640
have a requirement for it, but maybe we would if 
people knew that we had such a thing. So he said,

43:05.782 --> 43:14.592
well, I'm coming to Washington in two or three 
weeks, and we'll bring a hand-fabricated model

43:05.782 --> 43:14.592
in. So they did. And they showed it to me first. So I 
got a hold of this colonel and I told him what we had

43:22.207 --> 43:35.002
and I said, would you like for us to bring it up there 
and let me show it to you and Mr. Coleman show it to

43:22.207 --> 43:35.002
you? He said, yeah, come ahead. So we did. He was 
intrigued by it and of course he said, we still

43:38.446 --> 43:46.214
don't, you know, we don't have a requirement for 
anything like this. So he took it into his boss, we

43:47.376 --> 43:51.100
all traipsed into his office And he was intrigued 
with it. This last guy was named Charlie Hoss, and

43:58.021 --> 44:03.328
he was a colonel.

44:09.537 --> 44:21.272
But we just passed the time of day, and they said, 
well, if we think we can do something with this or

44:09.537 --> 44:21.272
there is a great need for it, well, we'll be back in 
touch with you, telling Sheldon Coleman. So about

44:23.277 --> 44:30.945
three weeks after that, Sheldon left and he left me 
the little hand-fabricated thing. I put it in my

44:31.045 --> 44:32.606
desk. I took it and I tried it out. It worked fine. 
But, you know, we were busy on a lot of other things.

44:40.194 --> 44:53.267
I think we were, I forget what the hottest projects 
were then, but Pearl Harbor had already happened

44:40.194 --> 44:53.267
then and we were working on

44:55.525 --> 45:03.856
We were already working on the G4 annex for the 
landings in North Africa, for the North African

44:55.525 --> 45:03.856
invasion. And a little bit later, took a couple of 
weeks after that, Colonel Haas came around and he

45:03.876 --> 45:14.450
said, say that stove that Mr. Coleman had in here. 
He says, was that our idea or his idea? I said, well,

45:19.537 --> 45:24.283
really it was our basic idea and we told them. 
They've patterned our idea into some flesh and

45:24.736 --> 45:30.103
bones. And he said, you know, he said, I think we can 
squeeze a little money and we might buy a few of

45:31.405 --> 45:38.915
them. And I said, well, that's fine. He says, how 
many do you suppose we could buy for $10,000 if I

45:40.717 --> 45:49.028
could get that much off of one of these other 
projects? And I said, I don't know, but I'll sure

45:49.049 --> 45:51.672
find out quick. So I called Sheldon out in Wichita 
and I said, how many of those stoves can you buy, can

45:52.782 --> 46:00.736
we buy for $10,000? And he says, well, we'll have to 
buy the dyes first and we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,
