WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:05.605
Let's stop and see and hope that it's working.

00:08.468 --> 00:17.598
The YMCA in those days was a prominent edifice that 
housed the Casey's Confectionery downstairs. It

00:18.699 --> 00:29.110
had a few rooms which were used for meetings of some 
sort, which I was never aware of. Monday and

00:29.933 --> 00:41.503
Tuesday and Thursday and Friday nights

00:29.933 --> 00:41.503
it was a locale for Yale practice. Yale practice 
was mandatory

00:41.563 --> 00:54.954
for all students and enforced pretty harshly by 
the seniors. The time to be there was about six and

01:00.562 --> 01:06.647
it lasted until about 720 or so.

01:09.430 --> 01:29.067
The

01:09.430 --> 01:29.067
band would be up on the

01:09.430 --> 01:29.067
upper veranda, I guess you'd call it, and the 
L-Eaters and the others that were going to speak

01:29.992 --> 01:35.018
performed about midway up on the steps. The 
freshmen and the sophomores would be on the walk

01:36.459 --> 01:48.293
between the building and the front first curve. 
And then the, I beg your pardon, it'd be just the

01:49.654 --> 01:55.761
freshmen that were on the first curve. Sophomores 
and juniors were half and half in the street in the

01:57.869 --> 02:03.336
sequence. And then the seniors were behind the the 
curve on the side toward the Puryear Hall. One

02:14.671 --> 02:25.665
incident that's worth telling there is that the 
live oak trees on the space between the street and

02:26.320 --> 02:55.872
the

02:26.320 --> 02:55.872
furrier dorm were fairly close together and if 
some unsuspecting soul had the misfortune to

02:26.320 --> 02:55.872
leave his car parked where the the out practice was 
to be held why the one enough freshmen had arrived.

03:00.652 --> 03:04.156
They literally would pick that car up and put it 
over between the trees. And at the time, there were

03:05.017 --> 03:10.944
a couple of trees that just fit a car just about 
snowed. So when the owner of the car, he had to bring

03:11.906 --> 03:16.992
the yell practices over no matter what. And then 
whenever he came, he had the devil of a time getting

03:17.592 --> 03:22.358
that thing out of there. Now, yell practices were 
normally held how often? Well, during the

03:27.458 --> 03:44.081
football season,

03:27.458 --> 03:44.081
if it was a way game, then they were Monday, 
Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. If it was a home game,

03:44.102 --> 03:48.087
the Friday was a midnight yell practice. And was it 
held in the stadium, midnight yell practice?

03:55.277 --> 03:55.778
No.

03:59.234 --> 04:04.540
I'll

03:59.234 --> 04:04.540
tell you, I kind of have to hedge on that. I believe 
we're going. But that's the only time. They never

04:09.606 --> 04:12.530
got away any other time. What about Guyon Hall? 
What happened at Guyon Hall? Well, it was a sort of a

04:18.777 --> 04:22.041
formal auditorium. Of course, it wouldn't have 
very many people.

04:27.854 --> 04:38.727
Dedications or things like that were there, but 
most of the students didn't, weren't really aware

04:27.854 --> 04:38.727
of it, although that was a, it was served as a movie 
theater. Did you all have movies there regularly?

04:41.930 --> 04:44.533
For a reason or so, yeah. And was there chapel 
services?

04:51.601 --> 04:56.427
May have been, but I don't remember being there. 
Can you think of, were there religious activities

04:57.352 --> 05:07.028
related to the community that you remember? Did 
many students on the weekend go to a worship

05:08.631 --> 05:13.278
service anywhere? Well, various denominations 
had

05:13.298 --> 05:21.672
churches or I know

05:22.681 --> 05:48.570
that

05:22.681 --> 05:48.570
there were great football teams at A&M in your 
first years tell me about those about football

05:48.787 --> 06:14.895
season well

05:48.787 --> 06:14.895
of course we arrived there in september of 40 with 
the team being the national champions from the

05:48.787 --> 06:14.895
year before and we we thoroughly made the most of 
every opportunity we could to see the team. Of

06:21.718 --> 06:39.183
course, you had a student activity card, which was 
part of the

06:21.718 --> 06:39.183
enrollment process, which paid for all the 
athletic events, so there was no problem in going.

06:39.203 --> 06:43.009
And of course, there were special sections for 
Freshmen knew where they were to be, and the

06:44.052 --> 06:51.859
sophomores and juniors knew where they were to be, 
and seniors were always up around the 50-yard

06:44.052 --> 06:51.859
line. Where? Were you all on the east side of Kyle 
Field? Yes. And did the Corps... From the 50-yard

06:57.805 --> 07:00.987
line north. Did the Corps march in before the game? 
No, the march in was... I don't know when they

07:06.773 --> 07:11.537
began, but it was in much more recent times. What 
about halftime? What did the band do in those days?

07:17.397 --> 07:22.142
Well, the band, of course, was always exemplary.

07:23.404 --> 07:25.466
Was their routine similar to what it is now? Well, 
the difference is they would go through a block

07:26.747 --> 07:42.544
arrangement and in and out and cross over and so 
forth, and then they would end up and

07:43.520 --> 07:50.627
spell out the opposing team or school. They would 
trail out, and they'd end up spelling out the name

07:52.688 --> 07:58.154
of the school. And then, once that was evident to 
the crowd, boy, they would evolve in under Texas

07:58.174 --> 08:07.262
Aggies and Marshall Field. So they did Texas 
Aggies, not a block T. Normally it is. Spelling

08:13.861 --> 08:21.692
out, spelling out the, at least the home, the other 
schools just spell out their own team. We always,

08:21.712 --> 08:32.126
A&M always spell out the opponent and our Texas 
Aggies.

08:32.146 --> 08:43.581
And during those years, those pre-war years, 
particularly your freshman year, were any of the

08:32.146 --> 08:43.581
football players on the campus considered more 
glamorous? or were the athletes just like

08:44.236 --> 08:51.362
everybody else in terms of the way you felt about 
them? Well, most of them lived in

08:53.844 --> 09:13.922
Dawn 12, at least in 1940, and that way they could 
kind of be there and have their own meals in Duncan

08:53.844 --> 09:13.922
and Storm, but They were in the Corps.

09:21.957 --> 09:36.819
In

09:21.957 --> 09:36.819
my semester,

09:21.957 --> 09:36.819
in the fall of 42, Errol Calley, who played Ian. 
C-O-W-L-E-Y? Yeah. Errol was a great guy, and he

09:40.514 --> 09:44.440
lived with us when he was born. In fact, I think it 
must have been in the middle of 42 that the school

09:44.460 --> 10:01.265
took out the exclusive phone for the athletes. So 
Errol came to live with us, and JB Montgomery, he

10:01.285 --> 10:10.318
was in G Battery down below us. All

10:11.311 --> 10:16.336
right. Other groups, other student activity 
groups that attracted a lot of attention, the

10:16.356 --> 10:25.585
band, were there singing cadets then? Yes, the 
singing cadets were there, and they performed.

10:30.870 --> 10:39.118
Occasionally, I don't know what kind of schedule 
it was, but their shark band was there. Was there a

10:39.138 --> 10:40.379
student government? Oh, yeah. I'll

10:42.530 --> 11:01.869
give

10:42.530 --> 11:01.869
you a quick guess on

10:42.530 --> 11:01.869
that. Yeah,

11:03.210 --> 11:09.736
there was. There was two together. Do you remember 
any major, before you and your colleagues go away

11:11.757 --> 11:21.607
to the war, do you remember any major arguments the 
students had with the administration? Any

11:23.589 --> 11:25.151
changes y'all were trying to? The main thing was to 
save our boys in June of 42. Okay. We had gone into

11:33.919 --> 11:39.385
the war and Major General George H. Moore was 
became a hero at Brigadier was O'Connor. Describe

11:45.464 --> 11:46.225
him. Tell me about him. Well, he was a very 
distinguished looking man. He had kind of thin

11:50.090 --> 11:55.797
hair and little, uh, thinness glasses. He was, I 
would say, about six foot one and weighed maybe 200

11:57.219 --> 12:07.712
pounds. Uh, But he, in my experience, he'd always 
been there. We were diving across Military Walk in

12:14.081 --> 12:23.152
Mitchell Hall from Ross Hall, which was Bullard's 
office. And we saw him fairly often. When did he go

12:25.575 --> 12:27.017
on active duty? Well, they called him in sometime 
in the spring of 42. Because he was there in the fall

12:35.307 --> 12:38.751
of 41, the war started. He went fairly quickly. I 
don't know. We generally didn't know much about

12:44.145 --> 12:46.349
it. Because he's at Corregidor when it falls, 
isn't he? Yes. All right, let's go to the war now.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.865
When you got to A&M, the war in Europe had already 
started. Did you all assume that the United States

12:56.905 --> 13:02.794
was going to be in that war? All of us did. What did 
you think... the impact was going to be on you?

13:12.208 --> 13:31.828
Well, at that point, if you say where it started, 
well, of course, the...

13:12.208 --> 13:31.828
Let me back up to

13:12.208 --> 13:31.828
Pearl Harbor. We all, going into the fall of 41, we 
all just, it was a... more or less an unspoken fact

13:39.177 --> 13:47.426
that we would all expect to be called in whenever 
anything started. Well, in my case, a group

13:47.446 --> 13:59.100
officer had gone down to the campus theater on 
December the 7th and saw the movie and came out of

13:47.446 --> 13:59.100
the movie. And as we did there in front of the campus 
theater, right here, everyone was abuzz about the

14:00.261 --> 14:08.931
strike at Pearl Harbor. And we were all just 
shocked, nothing to do with going to our rooms. So

14:16.659 --> 14:20.663
we all went to our rooms and hurled around our rooms 
with everything. Some guys had radios if they

14:22.785 --> 14:26.148
listened. Others, since there was only one 
telephone per unit,

14:26.168 --> 14:35.397
there wasn't much way anybody could call. So we 
were there. uh there were lots of fellas and

14:39.607 --> 15:09.141
generally there were lots of fellas that were 
ready to go right then to volunteer we were all

14:39.607 --> 15:09.141
there and we were in the middle of a sophomore year 
and we were all there to see what was going on but the

14:39.607 --> 15:09.141
word was sent around that just stay in place and 
wait and see what happened. Well, there were a

15:12.870 --> 15:28.446
number of guys that, oh, the other thing was that 
you had to volunteer to get in the Navy and you had to

15:12.870 --> 15:28.446
volunteer to get in the Air Force. And there were a 
number of guys that either they had Deer Johnson,

15:28.466 --> 15:38.976
their girlfriend, or they were flunking out, or 
they were just patriots anyway. They took off the

15:39.732 --> 15:46.843
next morning, on Monday morning, to volunteer. 
But most of us were disposed to see what we were, see

15:46.863 --> 15:56.497
what would develop.

16:00.162 --> 16:05.470
And the word came down there too that we would stay 
in school. and inducted all of us into the Enlisted

16:06.158 --> 16:10.705
Reserve Corps. We would be there at the end until 
fall. Right, and so in your case that led, that

16:15.994 --> 16:22.083
Enlisted Corps was Army? Yes. Okay. Everything in 
the school was Army. If you wanted to go to the Air

16:25.529 --> 16:33.381
Force, Air Corps at the time, it was Army Air Force, 
why you had to volunteer. So you're, correct me if

16:33.732 --> 16:51.039
I'm wrong, I get the impression that you're saying 
the leadership at A&M encouraged y'all to stay in

16:33.732 --> 16:51.039
school and wait for advice on what to do later. 
That's the military department. That's right.

16:54.485 --> 16:56.869
And it took three or four days for that to get shaken 
up. You take in my case, I desperately wanted a

17:01.947 --> 17:12.103
degree so that if I made it through the war, I'd have 
a pad to launch me on. And that's where most of us

17:12.224 --> 17:14.667
were. We started in our class of,

17:14.688 --> 17:27.448
we started in our class of, I believe,

17:32.457 --> 17:49.658
By

17:32.457 --> 17:49.658
the time we were called in May of 43, it

17:32.457 --> 17:49.658
was 650. How did the routine on the campus change 
after the war started? Well the military was a

17:54.884 --> 17:59.010
little more rigorous. They got going with some

18:08.907 --> 18:10.709
exercise drill. We had calisthenics in the 
morning every morning. We had obstacle courses.

18:17.054 --> 18:23.340
We had to run a two mile lap at least once a week. As 
far as I'd say the military text,

18:25.341 --> 18:37.412
what it took to understand the science, I would be 
pleased. because that's more intensive than it

18:38.168 --> 18:41.433
had been before. Right. Now, I'm assuming that 
before December 7, you and your classmates

18:41.674 --> 18:55.256
thought the probable enemy was in Europe more than 
you did in the Far East. Oh, yeah. See, in fact, when

18:56.278 --> 19:04.311
the man was sort of a forgotten entity, he backed 
up. The Germans invaded Russia in 39. And then that

19:09.869 --> 19:24.987
all evolved into the Germans then going into 
Austria and then they went up into Denmark and

19:09.869 --> 19:24.987
Norway. And then in the summer of 40, just as we were 
finishing our high school, the Germans swept

19:34.042 --> 19:40.789
through the Netherlands and Belgium and France. 
Well, it looked like there was just a juggernaut

19:40.809 --> 19:45.774
that didn't have any stopping. And we were all 
sobered by that. And there had been some articles

19:50.619 --> 20:01.551
in magazines that I'd read about how the Japanese 
were moving around in the Far East. Basically, you

20:02.881 --> 20:10.189
could say that the American public had really no 
knowledge at all of the potentia of Japanese.

20:10.930 --> 20:22.502
Everything the American public knew was that it 
was a Japanese, it was a cheap imitation.

20:22.662 --> 20:32.112
And very quickly, any Japanese military 
personnel was a helmeted, I mean,

20:32.783 --> 20:45.360
fabric-helmeted person with a ring of fur around 
his face and buck teeth and black horn-rimmed

20:32.783 --> 20:45.360
glasses. I later went to Japan looking for him 
after the war was over. As the war started, what did

20:50.327 --> 20:55.374
you and your classmates think was going to be the 
result of this war? Who was going to win it? Well,

20:57.337 --> 20:59.340
there was a lot of apprehension. I don't think we 
were ever in doubt that we would eventually win it.

21:03.057 --> 21:24.063
But there was a lot of apprehension about the 
Japanese because no sooner had Pearl Harbor

21:03.057 --> 21:24.063
happened than there became reports of some 
parachute bombs floating in from the Pacific and

21:03.057 --> 21:24.063
so forth. And there was a real apprehension that 
the Japs hit Pearl Harbor as a wake-up call and they

21:24.083 --> 21:32.794
were going to hit the West Coast. You

21:33.432 --> 21:41.582
said that General Moore went to the Pacific. As you 
all heard the news about the Philippines and

21:41.602 --> 21:47.630
Bataan and Corregidor, describe your thoughts. 
Well, it just extended the shock of Pearl Harbor.

21:59.205 --> 22:02.629
Suddenly the Japanese are running all over the 
place and taking everything. And there was very

22:03.267 --> 22:06.090
little information coming back. What was your 
impression of the leadership of the United States

22:07.792 --> 22:13.057
at that time? Did you have confidence in it?

22:17.461 --> 22:20.484
Yeah, we did. We didn't have any doubt of it. I think 
the only examples I know out now that where there

22:32.663 --> 22:36.608
was doubt of the American leadership. And I think 
one of them was Admiral Kimmel at Pearl Harbor.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.015
Whether he was or not, I don't know. I've been to 
Pearl Harbor, and I've looked over that setup and

22:43.035 --> 22:47.600
the whole thing.

22:50.464 --> 22:58.273
I just, I mean, there was an oversight or a goof 
there that let that happen. It would have happened

22:58.293 --> 23:01.236
anyway, just as bad as it was. The other was in North 
Africa where they canned a bunch of generals

23:01.823 --> 23:09.893
early on. December 8th, did you hear the speech 
that President Roosevelt made? Did you hear it on

23:15.980 --> 23:17.061
the radio? Yes. Where were you? I don't know. No, 
but were you in your dorm room? They didn't call the

23:22.548 --> 23:26.092
student body together, did they? No. I don't know. 
I guess I was in some sort of room. I was a sixth

23:30.848 --> 23:36.455
grader in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and we went to the 
school library, I remember. Let's see, before we

23:37.416 --> 23:45.446
let you go away to the war, did you have a car in those 
pre-war years? No. Tell me how you got back and

23:47.688 --> 23:50.091
forth to Fort Worth normally. Well, we all 
hitchhiked. Describe that routine. Well, the

23:54.857 --> 23:58.341
Aggies in the 30s, were the only people that wore 
uniforms. And the public got accustomed to that.

24:06.197 --> 24:11.262
And the Aggies also, very few of them ever had any 
transportation. So it developed that the Aggies

24:11.283 --> 24:25.999
had a routine for hitchhiking whereby there was an 
agreed upon departure point in each town up and

24:26.992 --> 24:29.295
down the main lines of Texas. And the custom was 
that the first guy there put his bag down and he hung

24:30.677 --> 24:39.007
out his thumb. And if he didn't get out before the 
next guy came, the next guy put his behind, and he

24:39.027 --> 24:48.378
waited until the first guy was gone, and then he 
moved up. And it was designed in such a way that the

24:48.398 --> 24:56.188
public could understand that they only had to take 
as many as they wanted. And of course there was

24:57.299 --> 25:08.691
always an emphasis, it was not in any official 
thing, but everybody around the campus made a

24:57.299 --> 25:08.691
point saying you gotta be curious and you gotta be 
helpful and everything. And it was very popular

25:09.472 --> 25:11.674
among the public. Where, near the campus, where 
was the departure point? Well, if you were gonna go

25:16.339 --> 25:25.669
to, if you were gonna go north, you had to go into 
Bryan and out to the whatever that crossroads is,

25:26.358 --> 25:30.141
or the navels was. There was a crossroads with a 
highway from Highway 6 going north. 21? Whatever

25:39.009 --> 25:39.530
it is. Caldwell to Madisonville? Caldwell to 
Madisonville. That was a takeoff point there. And

25:45.615 --> 25:54.103
in those days, you could load six guys in a cab to the 
quarter all the way to Bryan. All right, what if you

25:54.123 --> 25:56.145
were going to Houston? Well, if you're going to 
Houston, Highway 6 was complete past the campus.

26:01.304 --> 26:04.590
You went out to what would be empty now. We call it 
the East Gate. And you put your bag down and stand in

26:07.895 --> 26:11.141
line. One of my experiences along that line was 
that I went out there. I was exempt. in my first

26:22.552 --> 26:25.175
year. And I had a way to get out there and get a ride. 
And I was telling him, here came a guy in a red pickup

26:33.644 --> 26:39.490
truck.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.451
And I hopped in. I said, where are you going? I said, 
Houston. He said, well, let's go. Well, that guy

26:46.117 --> 26:50.121
took off down the road like I have never been before 
or since. I couldn't even guess how fast he was

26:50.141 --> 26:51.883
going. I was hanging on for dear life.

26:57.464 --> 26:59.587
No conversation, just going. Finally, I said, 
what you got in this thing? Is it magic glycerin?

27:09.000 --> 27:12.124
All I could do is keep holding on until he stopped 
and I could get out. During those years, about how

27:14.567 --> 27:18.853
often did you go home? Oh,

27:24.533 --> 27:28.217
Maybe once every two months or something like 
that. From A&M to

27:29.779 --> 27:45.858
Dallas and Fort Worth, there was one fellow in 
particular, he had a station wagon and he had a

27:29.779 --> 27:45.858
standard deal of a dollar each way. And if you got on 
his list early enough, well you could go and you

27:45.878 --> 27:50.883
could leave. This is a fellow student? And when, 
all right, and so you'd go on Saturday midday?

27:58.443 --> 28:00.947
Well, yeah, because we had Saturday classes. And 
that would be, just depending, maybe we'd leave

28:02.309 --> 28:11.122
Saturday morning or maybe we'd leave at noon 
Saturday. Anyway, we'd take off up the road and we

28:11.142 --> 28:19.735
had a place to meet in Dallas to get back together on 
Sunday afternoon and he'd get his back. That was

28:26.718 --> 28:28.421
his name on the roof. Now my roommate and his 
brother had a, as a sophomore,

28:28.441 --> 28:44.786
they had a 1941 maroon Mercury Converter for the 
white top. That was about as hot as you could get.

28:47.980 --> 28:53.006
And if his brother wasn't using it, well, I really 
could. We made a few trips like that. I made some

28:58.673 --> 29:02.357
others. Let's say on a weekend in the Bryan College 
Station area, where did an Aggie undergraduate go

29:03.579 --> 29:13.971
for a good time on Friday night and or Saturday 
night?

29:19.688 --> 29:35.112
Well, if the guy was turning the deer or run on 
what's a favorite in those days, he might go down to

29:19.688 --> 29:35.112
Fort Melbourne to Arlington and see what they had. 
Tell me where that was and tell me about that,

29:35.273 --> 29:39.039
please. It's about nine and a half, two miles south 
of the present point of the campus. I've gone back

29:45.329 --> 29:46.911
and found it these days. And I've been challenged 
to do so. And it was H-Y-R-D-L-I-C-K-A,

29:50.736 --> 29:55.360
something like that? H-R-D. H-R-D. L-I-K-A. 
Right. So a good Czech name, but pronounced by the

30:00.205 --> 30:05.891
average Aggie as hard liquors. Yeah. All right. 
Was liquor legal then? No. Liquor was the closest

30:09.935 --> 30:14.900
liquor was cost over the call rate. What did you all 
buy at hard liquors? beer and some rum. Oh so

30:20.216 --> 30:28.304
neither were were either of those legal or was that 
illegal in Brazos County? Well after a while you

30:28.324 --> 30:30.567
got where you get it. I tell you the truth I don't 
know. I didn't drink in those days and didn't think

30:32.869 --> 30:36.153
me to go with them for it. As far as you know what were 
the popular brands of beer that beer drinkers

30:36.493 --> 30:45.703
drank then?

30:46.848 --> 30:50.711
All

30:46.848 --> 30:50.711
right. Was it called... Was it called Whiskey 
Bridge then? Okay. Say later going straight west

31:00.480 --> 31:10.769
towards Snook and when you got into Burleson 
County there was a stop over there where legally

31:00.480 --> 31:10.769
you could buy whiskey. Okay. Describe the 
Northgate area. What was over there, Northgate?

31:19.156 --> 31:26.997
Well, as you went north from the A&M Post Office,
