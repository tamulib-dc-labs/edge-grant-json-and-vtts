00:01.904 --> 00:13.808
Is it possible for your mom to tell me a little more 
about life in Mexico and the trip to Mexico to the

00:01.904 --> 00:13.808
United States? Is it possible, ma'am? Su historia 
de muchos años pesados. El viaje de Texas. Pues,

00:23.257 --> 00:29.705
mira, lo que yo sé, te voy a decir un poquito, de 
cuando vino ella aquí a estos estados. Sí. Bueno,

00:30.947 --> 00:41.059
según yo he oído platicar, ella también lo sabe, 
nomás que ahorita no se acuerda. Mire, mamá, lo que

00:41.079 --> 00:47.267
le quiere decir ella es cómo vino a dar... Here in 
Texas. You told me, and I know, my uncle first came

00:49.339 --> 00:56.607
here to the States, right? The one with my mom? Yes. 
Well, that's what she wants to know. In that one in

01:00.531 --> 01:08.020
St. Rice that there was, at the beginning of Puras 
Pastas, he was the one who came to give here. And he

01:08.100 --> 01:10.082
was the one who, without the help of us, took us. 
Yes. My uncle was the first? Yes. And who else? My

01:18.728 --> 01:21.912
uncle Atanasio and my uncle Bernardo. They were 
already here. They had a lot of time here, I think.

01:24.976 --> 01:27.619
Brothers of you or your husband? No, he was my 
mother's little brother. Brother of your mother?

01:33.747 --> 01:39.514
Yes, my mother's little brother. And he comes 
first? Where was your mother born? Well, I don't

01:45.049 --> 01:47.152
know where my mother would have been born. But she 
is from Mexico. She is from Mexico. Yes. Well, that

01:51.519 --> 01:55.204
place where I am from, I think that place would be 
her as well. I don't know. Yes. Well, tell me about

01:57.868 --> 02:01.834
this trip. In what way did you come? By bus? By 
train? But don't you

02:10.525 --> 02:33.411
remember

02:10.525 --> 02:33.411
the trip?

02:34.505 --> 02:38.130
Well, the trip when he brought us here. Yes, the 
trip here. Mom, you... Look, according to that...

02:42.315 --> 02:50.826
I don't know, my husband is the one who fixed 
everything.

02:50.846 --> 02:56.293
Mom, what she wants to say, mom, is that you came 
here hired. I don't know anything, Lupe. I saw your

02:59.267 --> 03:01.990
father and he didn't tell me to see my mother. He 
went through the bridge. Look, they went through,

03:03.451 --> 03:08.096
you know, look, that's what I know. They came, they 
came because my uncle. Yes. And he was uncle on

03:13.102 --> 03:18.748
behalf of his mother, of her sister. Yes. See? He 
was our uncle, who has been her brother-in-law.

03:23.833 --> 03:24.474
Yes. Well. Y luego, un hermanito de su cuñado de 
ella vino, fueron los primeros que vinieron pa'

03:25.670 --> 03:32.356
Texas. Sí. Bueno. Según eso, ellos venían, 
trajeron familias contratadas de México pa' acá.

03:41.444 --> 03:41.704
Sí. Y que pagaban nomás la pasada. Ellos pasaron 
por el puente y pagaban un nicle. Sí. Ándale. En la

03:48.831 --> 03:49.471
fuente. En el puente. Eso sé lo que me acuerdo que me 
platicaban los abuelitos y mi tío. Bueno,

03:55.657 --> 04:18.021
entonces cuando ya estaban los tíos aquí, fueron 
para atrás, ya ellos habían hecho poco dinerito

03:55.657 --> 04:18.021
aquí, y ellos ya sabían, pero de ahí para allá yo no 
sé cómo vendrían ellos, pero ellos decían que

03:55.657 --> 04:18.021
pasaban por el puente y daban un nicle, ¿ves? 
Bueno, entonces ellos ya se enteraron todo cómo

04:18.501 --> 04:24.668
estaba aquí, entonces fueron por mi... mi 
abuelito y mi abuelita y mi mamá que es ella y mi papá

04:24.648 --> 04:43.247
entonces vinieron todos ellos juntos y luego una 
hermanita de mi abuelita también y entonces se

04:24.648 --> 04:43.247
vino su su esposo de mi tía mía también con ellos. 
Esas dos personas los trajeron a ellos. Y no nomás a

04:51.982 --> 04:57.788
ellos, mucha gente, porque los trajeron 
contratados, una persona, no sé quién. ¿Ves? Pero

04:58.569 --> 05:01.212
de esas gentes de los trabajos. Sí, estaba mucha 
gente en este grupo. Ándale. Sí. Pero Guadalajara

05:06.678 --> 05:12.644
está muy lejos de Texas. ¿En qué modo? Caminando 
por Texas? O en qué modo fueron? Oh, ese sí. Este,

05:23.606 --> 05:28.934
bueno, te juro que eso sí, no, no, no te doy razón yo. 
De allí, ¿sabes en dónde estuvieron? Por eso no

05:31.198 --> 05:32.800
caminaron mucho. Entonces, ellos pasaron y 
estuvieron en... Brunsville. Brunsville.

05:43.496 --> 05:43.636
Cheype. En Cheype.

05:47.470 --> 05:53.667
Yes, there is a little town called Brozville, 
Cheipe. I think they used to call it Cheipe, but now

05:54.328 --> 06:00.906
it's Brozville. It's a prison. They were working 
there with my family. They made money to walk

06:08.297 --> 06:12.301
there. So when they got there, they were working 
there, all that group. So they were making the cut.

06:21.430 --> 06:25.114
They were barely making the cut. I think it was, now 
you'll see, it was from Limburgo. In Limburgo.

06:31.482 --> 06:34.527
That's where they arrived, they were just making 
the cut. They were making it when they arrived.

06:37.613 --> 06:54.703
Then from there, I don't know how long they would 
last there, so they brought them here to this place

06:37.613 --> 06:54.703
of Tlalcuta, yes, everything was Puro Monte. 
Entonces, estaba la tienda que le decían el señor

06:55.021 --> 07:01.298
Barras. Que yo no sé qué será de la señora. Where are 
you? What's the lady's name? I don't know if her

07:08.809 --> 07:13.475
father owned that store. All these people there 
were dealing with that man. Everyone was going

07:20.022 --> 07:25.208
there with that man who had a very big store that 
they had already taken away. All these people were

07:25.228 --> 07:29.112
going there with him. very close to my father and my 
uncles and my grandparents and everything. Ay,

07:39.405 --> 07:41.948
with that man. I think that my grandmother was Real 
de Oro. Real de Oro. Yes, because my grandmother

07:54.359 --> 07:58.709
was what she said. Yes. Real de Oro. Well, you 
married in Real de Oro, right? Yes, I married in

08:05.884 --> 08:08.430
Real de Pozos. Real de Pozos. Real de pozos. Real de 
pozos y real de loros, y así le decían. O sea, cuál

08:15.758 --> 08:19.564
será, pero allí decía mi abuelita. Sí. Minerales. 
Es bonito allá. Puros cerros. Puros cerros. No,

08:26.655 --> 08:28.018
puros cerros. ¿Cómo te pasa? Cerros, cerros, 
muchos cerros. Y el pueblo está sentado abajo. Up

08:33.622 --> 08:35.864
there, you can only see hills. Yes. If you look to 
the side, there are puddles of water that come down

08:36.425 --> 08:40.850
here. Yes. All hills. Pure hills. Yes. And down 
there is the town. Did you live in the town? No. No?

08:50.380 --> 08:52.463
Here on the banks where the mines were. Near the 
mines? Yes, yes. On the back of the hills were the

08:57.528 --> 09:00.051
houses. And the village was down there. What kind 
of houses? Well, you know, houses of the poor.

09:09.014 --> 09:11.580
Houses of stone, and also with earth. But they were 
earthen houses, with terraces and rooms. Yes,

09:16.771 --> 09:33.362
that's right.

09:33.342 --> 09:36.667
They make houses out of grass. They make houses out 
of... They make houses out of... They make houses

09:43.276 --> 09:44.698
out of... They make houses out of... They make 
houses out of... They make houses out of... They

09:50.647 --> 09:52.690
make houses out of... They make houses out of... 
They make houses out of... Tortillas to sell, my

09:57.406 --> 09:59.889
grandmother. Yes. In Mexico? In Mexico, yes. Yes, 
because I was afraid of one. Is there enough to eat

10:07.618 --> 10:10.822
there in Mexico? Yes, but look at the money. Well, 
yes, for your family there was enough to eat. There

10:18.310 --> 10:22.015
is no money for the poor people, there is no work, 
there is nothing. There is nothing? There is no

10:22.635 --> 10:23.837
work? There are parts where there is no work. My 
father used to pay 50 cents a day to clean the mines.

10:32.534 --> 10:34.617
50 cents a day. And your husband too? No, my father, 
when he was living next to my father, he earned 50

10:37.461 --> 10:46.954
cents. Above the mine. There was a mine of what 
material? Of copper or silver or what? Of pure

10:56.804 --> 10:57.806
silver. Silver? Silver and gold and everything. 
But look, they were all beating them up before they

11:01.413 --> 11:10.971
left because they didn't want anything to happen 
to them. Every time they were beaten up, they were

11:11.352 --> 11:14.538
punished. All the doormen were at the door when 
they left work. They were beating them up. And what

11:19.167 --> 11:21.852
kind of work did your husband have? Your husband? 
No, he was at the ranch all the time. Ah, so he wasn't

11:26.627 --> 11:31.455
at the mines, only your father? No, my father who 
worked at the mine. Was the life at the ranch better

11:34.140 --> 11:39.448
than the life at the mine? Yes, it was better. Why? 
Because I don't know why life at the ranch was

11:42.233 --> 11:46.240
better. Because they raised the chickens, they 
raised the sheep, they raised one who helped. Y en

11:50.215 --> 11:55.021
los minas fue posible tener gallinas. Allí no hay 
nada de eso, más de puro trabajo del esposo. No hay

11:58.105 --> 12:02.150
comidas para... No, no hay nada. Pura piedra. Pura 
piedra. Pura piedra. Y no hay toantes o nada. Vas tú

12:07.137 --> 12:08.458
al agua, a los cerros. Sí. O trae el agua a los cerros 
y aquí no estamos de cerca, entero de una estela

12:10.181 --> 12:14.847
para acá. Ahí. Acá arriba el agua de Tamar. Sí. Ahí, 
muy duro. There's no water nearby, right? No,

12:22.054 --> 12:25.037
there's no water nearby. Was it necessary to bring 
water? Yes, from the hills. For a long distance?

12:30.903 --> 12:31.763
No, not very far. It's the side of the hills where 
you go to swim. After you got married, did you live

12:36.408 --> 12:40.571
on the ranch or in Nena? No, we lived on the ranch. 
Until the first time, we lived on the ranch. No

12:47.945 --> 12:50.048
neighbors or anything, just the ranch. Yes, all 
the time, just the ranch. Yes, because my father

12:53.033 --> 13:00.384
was, all the time since he got married, he was a 
worker at the ranch. Oh, your father, your father,

13:01.045 --> 13:06.173
you never lived on the mills. No, they live in the 
ranch, but your father was alone. Alone, alone in

13:11.586 --> 13:12.848
the ranch. Alone, alone, without his mother. Yes. 
And you and your mother and the other children live

13:16.772 --> 13:20.617
all the time in the ranch. Only ranch, yes. Only 
ranch. No, because my mother was my daughter. Only

13:25.623 --> 13:28.948
her daughters had my grandparents. Only her. Just 
her. She and my other aunt. Just two. Two women. But

13:37.726 --> 13:46.386
my other aunt got married in Mexico and she was with 
my grandmother. Mi abuelito todo el tiempo iba a la

13:46.822 --> 13:56.554
mina, pero ellas allí tenían su lugar como aquí, 
pero mi abuelito iba donde estaba la mina a

13:46.822 --> 13:56.554
trabajar. Mi mamá se casó, mi papá no iba a la mina, 
iba a la labor todo el tiempo. Mi papá todo el tiempo

14:04.683 --> 14:09.729
le gustó allá en México y aquí trabajar en la labor. 
Nunca en las minas. No, he was always like that. But

14:14.514 --> 14:17.337
your grandfather was a miner? Yes, my grandfather 
was a miner. Did your grandfather's father also

14:20.600 --> 14:23.723
work in the mines? No, the father of... The father 
of your father, mom. The father of your father? No,

14:32.252 --> 14:35.515
he worked in another mountain range. Another 
mountain range? Yes, because he came to see us. He

14:39.278 --> 14:40.960
came from another mountain range, I never knew. He 
came to visit us and bring us any gift from over

14:41.345 --> 14:46.431
there. Yes. But I didn't know where he was going. 
It's just hills and mountains. Yes, but his work is

14:53.580 --> 14:56.884
in the mines too? No, only my father does it. Only 
your father? Yes, I don't know. His grandfather

15:02.531 --> 15:05.575
is... his grandfather? Yes, grandfather, but he 
doesn't... He's filling all those mountains over

15:08.579 --> 15:11.082
there. Pure beings, far away. Was he a cappuccino 
or what? The work in the labors? Well, I think he

15:21.618 --> 15:24.380
also worked in the labors, who knows. I think, you 
didn't know him, that he came there? Yes, because

15:28.824 --> 15:30.826
he came to see us. I never heard his voice, never. 
No, I didn't hear anything. No, because he came to

15:35.451 --> 15:37.252
see us, to visit us. But two or three days later, he 
was coming back. We were never right about your

15:40.981 --> 15:44.444
farm, your house, no. And your ranch, was it 
beautiful? The grandfather's. And you, mom,

15:50.831 --> 15:52.292
where did you live? Oh, my little ranch is like 
here. One ranch here, another one over there, and

15:55.295 --> 15:58.578
so on. All the ranches are removed. No, mom, she 
wants to tell you how we have it here, right? How was

16:04.064 --> 16:06.266
your place where you were? Clean, beautiful, 
something that you had there. Well, yes,

16:10.580 --> 16:14.286
beautiful trees and everything. Tuna poles, and 
well, when it was time. Yes. Yes. A lot of cranes, a

16:19.814 --> 16:25.162
lot of tarpaulins, a lot of tarpaulins. Well, like 
here, there's a lot of that. Did you go back to

16:29.308 --> 16:33.234
Mexico again since you came to the United States? 
No, my mom never went. I don't think I even know. I

16:36.378 --> 16:37.560
don't think I even know where to go. Nothing. 
Nothing? I fell like a stone in the well. I never got

16:41.817 --> 16:43.320
there. My father never knew about his father, or 
his mother, or his brothers. My father never knew

16:52.820 --> 16:56.307
anything. And they made money and they didn't try 
to go. Because since they didn't have papers to

16:59.450 --> 17:04.424
fix, they didn't fix it at that time. They didn't 
fix it, since they didn't bother them, they never

17:04.885 --> 17:11.444
fixed it. So, my father never went there. No one 
went there. Not even my brothers have fixed it yet.

17:17.157 --> 17:18.880
Because they grew up here. My brother already 
fixed it, he has everything. But he still doesn't

17:21.765 --> 17:25.172
want to move there. But my mother never went. She 
came here and she didn't know where to go. There is

17:32.124 --> 17:35.751
sadness sometimes for your home in Mexico. You, 
you, you think, mom, in Mexico. You have always

17:42.432 --> 17:51.547
thought, mom, that, as Juanita says, what aunt 
wouldn't want to come to Mexico, mom? No, no. I

17:54.312 --> 18:02.025
mean, I don't have there, all those who stayed, who 
were people of my husband, they were dead, they

17:54.312 --> 18:02.025
were in the war, God knows, they would kill, God 
knows. My whole family saw that it was my mother and

18:02.900 --> 18:04.922
my father. It was my whole family. Yes, your mother 
and father and everything was quiet. I would go to

18:11.330 --> 18:14.334
see my mother-in-law. He never did the duty of 
leaving. When I got there, I got upset. I said,

18:17.758 --> 18:22.083
well, I was saving money to go to Mexico and he never 
did the duty of leaving. Well, it's worth not

18:22.103 --> 18:25.407
saying anything. I never went out again. Never, 
never. He lost everything. Everything ended up in

18:32.330 --> 18:35.315
Mexico. But I don't think mom wants to go to her 
country because, since we haven't arranged a

18:35.616 --> 18:47.256
permit for her, she can go because she's been here 
for years. Yes, but I don't like it here in Mexico. I

18:52.365 --> 18:55.350
don't think so. Well, I don't know. Because all the 
time that I was in California, I really like it

18:58.634 --> 19:10.285
there because I have a lot of friends there, I have 
my children, and I would like to go there. But she

19:10.705 --> 19:15.930
has her family here in the same place. But I'm going 
to see her. Yes. I don't even have to go. I'm happy to

19:20.795 --> 19:24.338
go to see my uncle, to see my uncle. I don't have 
anyone. That's why

19:26.228 --> 19:30.692
I'm leaving. I don't want to go to Mexico. Even if I 
die,

19:33.415 --> 19:38.120
I'll stay here. No, I'm not going. I have a friend 
who went to Mexico. I think he's in San Luis Potosi.

19:45.988 --> 19:51.173
It was the two of them, the two men in their truck. Y 
ellos, dice mi compadre, comadre, hacía muchos

19:51.760 --> 19:59.591
años que yo no iba allí. Dice, y siempre fui 
reconociendo, dice, de tantos años hay cosas que

19:59.611 --> 20:09.185
todavía hay cuando yo existía allá y que estaba 
joven. Dice, y me siento contento, dice, porque

20:10.026 --> 20:21.463
todavía hay cosas cuando yo estaba, mi tío y mis 
hermanas y... And she says, I feel very good. But if

20:27.214 --> 20:29.278
I go, I will look everywhere. I don't have anyone. 
Yes, mom, but when you go, mom, and you look at one

20:34.588 --> 20:41.241
thing, you... you will feel happy because you say, 
no, I'm happy, I will feel like crying. Well, both

20:50.424 --> 20:51.846
things. Because the heart is never happy. As you 
wish, but there are things that one reflects in

20:53.568 --> 21:09.372
those times,

20:53.568 --> 21:09.372
be it with sadness, or it has to give it sadness and 
pleasure, but as you wish. That's what my mother

21:10.111 --> 21:12.575
says. No, because I know she doesn't. Because I 
have to refuse my mother, my husband, and all that.

21:20.286 --> 21:20.907
Do you believe that? No. This heart can't. This is 
her land now. For many years. Yes. Because her

21:28.538 --> 21:38.813
mother stayed here, and her father stayed here, 
and my father stayed here, and all her children

21:28.538 --> 21:38.813
stayed here. Yes. That's why I tell you, I will 
never go to Mexico.

21:51.218 --> 22:03.673
I go to California and I say, because of these 
places I walked with my children, because of these

21:51.218 --> 22:03.673
places I was very anxious, because of these paths I 
walked, and we all walked together. And now I go

22:04.634 --> 22:05.275
alone. Now that I went, I went with the two, well, 
the three, with the daughter-in-law. There are

22:10.281 --> 22:16.248
times that I go only with Janie and Asina, and you 
always feel sad. You feel sad for life, right? Yes.

22:20.480 --> 22:23.829
My life has been very sad. Your life has been very 
sad? All my

22:26.536 --> 22:30.326
life. Lupe has always been like that. His life has 
always been sad. I felt more about my children than

22:35.313 --> 22:42.460
I felt about my husband. I don't think a husband 
feels like that. I don't think a husband feels like

22:47.925 --> 22:50.287
that. And a husband who does well with one, will cry 
until he dies, like it happened to me. My husband

22:59.076 --> 23:02.299
was very good to me and his children. Mom struggled 
a lot here because she didn't have a stove, she

23:04.810 --> 23:14.588
didn't have anything. She would put the baths in 
the fire and she would put a lot of tortillas and

23:14.628 --> 23:27.392
everything she did. And I, you know where I grew up? 
She used to put one of those little beds that they

23:31.145 --> 23:35.813
used to make. Like this, in squares, a canvas and a 
square, that's how they used to make it. And they

23:40.581 --> 23:48.293
used to put it there, and they used to put me there, 
and I would get wet, the air was the one that would

23:40.581 --> 23:48.293
get me wet. Yes. It was there. There was a stick, it 
was her crib. A stick, and she would hang it on the

23:50.557 --> 23:52.300
crib and roll it there. I never went to the 
hospital, I never went to the doctor, I never

23:52.735 --> 24:07.422
did anything. I got married and now I've been to the 
hospital twice. Y esta última vez que yo estuve en

24:13.492 --> 24:19.538
el hospital, yo me sentí muy a gusto. Porque nunca 
había descansado como descansé ese día, esas

24:19.618 --> 24:25.203
veces que estuve en el hospital. Yo creo que estuve 
tres semanas. Hasta entonces, descansé de tan mi

24:27.565 --> 24:32.530
larga vida a trabajar. ¿Ves?

24:37.034 --> 24:42.440
Y eso es... No, me salió de buenas vidas y buenos 
pensamientos. Sí. Because she gave birth to her

24:44.660 --> 24:49.624
whole family. I know you gave birth to both of your 
children. They got married a year ago. Two years

24:56.771 --> 24:57.472
ago, right? You gave birth to both of your 
children.

25:02.156 --> 25:05.779
They came out of here like a little lady. They got 
married. And a lot of very fine children. That's a

25:08.341 --> 25:10.563
good thing in life. I think. And you also had 12. 
Twelve children? Yes, twelve children. And all of

25:16.167 --> 25:18.270
them lived? Yes, all of them were taken away by God. 
And my family was taken away too. Only three of them

25:23.358 --> 25:25.681
stayed with me. I was the only one who was married. I 
was the only daughter of my mother. And I was the

25:31.049 --> 25:34.374
only one who was married. You? Yes, I was the only 
one who was married. There were twelve children

25:37.318 --> 25:39.962
and only one was married? Yes, my two brothers. Oh, 
two brothers. We were two brothers and a woman, and

25:43.388 --> 25:48.617
two men. From twelve to only three I got married. 
For what reason did you never get married, your

25:51.361 --> 25:57.271
children, your other children? Well, they lasted 
a long time, my mother, my brothers. The youngest

26:02.841 --> 26:04.684
had seventeen years. The youngest of her sisters. 
How old is your sister? 17 years old. 17 years old.

26:13.608 --> 26:15.073
She's young. But she died. But they died. I don't 
have any more sisters, only my two brothers. Your

26:24.808 --> 26:26.050
two brothers? Yes. And they are married? She was 17 
years old when she died, the youngest. Oh, she

26:34.204 --> 26:35.266
still died? Yes, yes. My brothers are married. Two 
brothers and how many sisters? There were twelve.

26:45.437 --> 26:45.899
Twelve. There were eight. Ten. Ten sisters. There 
are ten daughters. No fueron ocho, porque los

26:55.424 --> 27:01.074
otros son hombres, bebitos. Ocho mujeres y cuatro 
hombres. Y dos hombres vivían y se casaron. Pero de

27:08.547 --> 27:13.295
estas mujeres solamente una se casó. Y las otras, 
¿dónde viven las otras? They all died. All the

27:19.098 --> 27:24.831
little ones and the big ones, they all died. I was 
the only one left as a woman. Of all the sisters,

27:26.555 --> 27:28.219
only me. And my two sisters. All the sisters died. 
They are sisters. But where did these big sisters

27:32.929 --> 27:35.134
live? Oh, they were with my mom all the time. All the 
time? Yes, with my dad. Ah, also. Now they live

27:42.789 --> 27:44.171
together. They filled a table like this one for 
another family. Ah, yes. Yes. Well, for what

27:49.381 --> 27:54.150
reason did these others never get married? No, 
they left, they came back. To the world, my

27:56.495 --> 27:58.277
daughters. They never... They were not dancers, 
they were not of any taste. Well, maybe, for what

28:04.786 --> 28:08.411
reason did you get married? Well, so you can see, 
because I was the first one to get married. The

28:13.438 --> 28:17.103
first one to come, and the first one to get married. 
Oh, yes. Yes. But my sisters, look, they lasted a

28:17.684 --> 28:20.428
long time. Yes. No, mi hermanita.

28:27.292 --> 28:33.318
Mi hermanita, la más chica que todas, ella tenía 15 
años cuando se casó. Hay otra. Ah, otra. Otra, pero

28:35.600 --> 28:40.345
ella se fue con el esposo para México. Ah, sí. ¿De 
qué parte de México? Ahí está en el 18 de marzo. Sí.

28:47.652 --> 28:50.394
Ahí es donde está ella, al otro de Matamoros. Sí. 
Allá está ella, pero ella ya se murió. Ella no está,

28:54.618 --> 28:56.320
mi hermana. No? No. We haven't seen my sister or 
anything. Because she left in... I

29:03.836 --> 29:11.943
don't know if it was in 1941 or 1942, she left with my 
sister. And she never writes or anything? No,

29:14.205 --> 29:16.347
she's already dead. She died. She died. She left 
two children. Yes. Yes, now there's one here in...

29:25.426 --> 29:30.996
Near Amarillo there is a nephew who is the son of my 
sister. Yes. There he is. He only left two men and a

29:32.959 --> 29:37.647
woman. But it ended so well. And there they are now. 
First when they left, now it is beautiful. Yes, now

29:46.022 --> 29:48.767
it is beautiful. Have you never been to that place 
in Mexico? Have you been to Mexico? I know a lot of

29:55.795 --> 30:00.459
places in Mexico. I lived for three months in 
Urapán, Michoacán. It's

30:05.244 --> 30:14.653
a beautiful town. Very beautiful. It's very 
beautiful. The state of Guadalajara, I think, is

30:18.424 --> 30:22.612
very beautiful. The mountains are beautiful, the 
trees, the fields are green. Yes, I like Mexico

30:28.162 --> 30:30.747
very much. The land is very beautiful. The land is 
very beautiful. Yes, Mexico is very beautiful.

30:38.185 --> 30:47.297
What happens is that the poor people have to come 
here to look for a better way to live. That's what

30:47.317 --> 30:49.660
happens. Like us going to California. I went 
because I really liked to know. I had never been

30:58.212 --> 31:01.617
there. Me gustaba porque allá pagaban más, me 
gustaba porque aquí no había nada. Allá te cansas

31:09.288 --> 31:13.995
tú, mejor te cansas tú de trabajar, que el trabajo 
se acabe. Necesitas tú decir, ya me cansé, o decir,

31:15.096 --> 31:24.410
estoy malo, porque en esos estados todo el tiempo 
hay trabajo. Solo en invierno duras dos, tres

31:25.311 --> 31:29.477
meses. that there is no work because of the winter, 
but not because of it. In California, only the

31:34.886 --> 31:43.440
water or the cold was removed, and you are going to 
step on the cotton. Yes, there is a time here that

31:43.660 --> 31:47.246
there is a lack of work. Yes. In winter, or what 
time? Here? Yes, in Texas. Well, here in Texas

31:53.390 --> 32:02.682
there is no

31:53.390 --> 32:02.682
January, December, October and all that. Many 
months. Many months, yes. That's why you had to go.

32:08.730 --> 32:12.475
Those who want to go, they go to where there is work. 
And I left because I wanted to go to other states. I

32:17.622 --> 32:29.798
worked there alone and I had a lot of money to 
support my kids because I earned 10 pesos a day. So

32:29.818 --> 32:32.421
10 pesos a day I did it very well with the boys, and 
then two or three days that they were off, they

32:32.401 --> 32:41.417
worked. And they paid them very well, so that we 
worked very well. And here, where do you work? Here

32:51.114 --> 32:53.578
there was not enough work. Only the pizca season 
and that was it. In Washington, it's the same. In

33:00.216 --> 33:03.279
winter, it's hard in Washington. But if you work in 
Washington for three or four months, you get the

33:03.840 --> 33:15.252
same job. And you earn more, twice as much. Yes, we 
have to go all the way to Mexico. We're not going

33:21.178 --> 33:21.679
anywhere. That's why I liked it a lot. It's the same 
as here. It's like a ranch. I don't ask about

33:27.003 --> 33:31.952
anything because I don't know. It's like a ranch. 
Was there a owner in the ranch over there? We came

33:36.660 --> 33:41.048
from over there to come here. From Sunrise to the 
ranch. To build one in the ranch. She's talking

33:46.803 --> 33:50.329
about your boss, mom. Did you work with a boss? In 
Mexico? Yes, my husband did. What's the name of

33:56.880 --> 34:00.126
your husband's boss in Mexico? Do you remember? I 
don't even remember.

34:06.376 --> 34:07.298
It's been a long time. His name was Abundo Ayala. 
What? Abundo. Abundo Ayala. Abundo Ayala.

34:14.934 --> 34:16.356
Abundio Ayala. Ayala was the boss. It was a farm 
there where my husband worked. It was a farm? What

34:24.506 --> 34:26.088
was the name of the farm? I don't know, but the owner 
was Abundo Ayala. Abundo Ayala. That's where my

34:31.915 --> 34:34.017
husband worked with him. They didn't live there 
because of the fire. The one in Hacienda is called

34:36.635 --> 34:41.139
Rancho Grande. Yes, I understand. The one in 
Hacienda is called Rancho Grande. It's just that

34:49.767 --> 34:57.453
it's different from what they say

34:49.767 --> 34:57.453
here. And Mr. Ayala, what happened to him? Who 
knows? Who knows, but we came here. God knows, they

35:06.487 --> 35:09.312
will live, they will die, God knows. No, well, if 
they lived, you realize that if I went over there

35:10.795 --> 35:23.938
and stayed with the place, I would go down to my 
house, because that's where we came from. That's

35:23.958 --> 35:26.282
where they lived since they got married? Yes, 
that's where they worked. He was a horse herder, a

35:29.588 --> 35:36.297
horse herder of animals, he did all the work there. 
He

35:36.317 --> 35:43.487
would be stronger, I don't know. My father liked a 
lot to tie the horses or whatever, and to knock them

35:43.807 --> 35:51.417
down. He wasn't afraid of the animals. He had a lot 
of courage for that. Yes. He really liked to eat

36:00.413 --> 36:04.939
manganese and manzanas and everything. He really 
liked the tobacco. And does he want to leave

36:06.141 --> 36:14.091
the farm? In those days, his mom and dad went to 
Texas. Does his husband really want to go to Texas

36:17.795 --> 36:23.242
too? To go to Texas too? Well, they don't exist 
anymore. They all died. They don't exist anymore.

36:35.039 --> 36:41.345
But they never went, they never went to the west, to 
Mexico. No, they don't want to go. They never

36:45.710 --> 36:47.051
wanted to go. They wanted to go, but they didn't. I 
don't know. I still go because my husband never

36:54.149 --> 37:01.398
said, let's go to Mexico.

37:03.882 --> 37:12.012
And I, a very poor person, told him, let's gather 
money little by little and let's go to Mexico.

37:12.673 --> 37:14.736
Because he had all his people in Monterrey. No, no. 
And now, he didn't want to say that we were going in a

37:17.920 --> 37:22.806
bus, because we had a car. No, never. And now that 
I'm alone, my boy, Rudy, let's go to Mexico, mom.

37:33.307 --> 37:33.568
Let's go. This girl who is in Pennsylvania, now 
that she came, we went two or three times to Laredo.

37:38.578 --> 37:40.763
And Juanita also took me to Mexico. And no... Ya de 
hora que nosotros tenemos carros, vamos pa' todas

37:42.648 --> 37:47.181
partes. Sí. Y ahora dice, ahora que me den las 
vacaciones, vamos pa' California. Le digo, pues

37:53.679 --> 37:55.645
sí, sí, vamos. That's why the thought, the person 
has it since they were little. When she was in low

38:03.408 --> 38:14.327
grade, all the time she would tell me, mom, when I 
grow up, let's say I'm a girl and I finish school and

38:03.408 --> 38:14.327
go to work. I'm going to buy a car, she would say, and 
then I'll take her everywhere for a walk, she would

38:14.387 --> 38:22.881
say. And I tell her, look, it seems that God granted 
you, because now that she finished her school, she

38:23.401 --> 38:45.612
then bought her first cart, and now she bought 
another cart, and she takes me everywhere,

38:23.401 --> 38:45.612
wherever I tell her to go, I just tell her... Get out 
of work and let's go. See? God granted us, He

38:51.571 --> 38:55.877
granted you to take us for a walk. Yes. Yes. Well, 
this is one of the most interesting stories I've

38:58.020 --> 39:05.311
heard. You've heard. Yes. And thank you very much. 
Yes, well, look, I have had, as it was that my boy, I

39:10.702 --> 39:21.815
lost him, right? Yes. I wanted very much to see for 
myself La historia de su vida. Y fue lo que me dijo mi

39:35.901 --> 39:45.812
muchacho, mamá, usted debió de haber puesto en el 
papel, dijo, la historia de la vida de mi hermano. Y

39:45.832 --> 39:51.478
le dije, pues sí, pero como yo no sé leer, si yo 
supiera leer, cállate. Yo estoy, estoy, estoy,

39:52.199 --> 39:55.123
estoy de todo. Porque dice mi mamá que yo no sé por 
qué yo, mira, I bring money, I bring things like

40:01.799 --> 40:10.012
that, whatever I buy. I don't know where, so much 
that I raise it, I don't know where it is. And you see

40:14.359 --> 40:17.745
everything I've been telling you. And I have many 
more things. And how is it being recorded? How do I

40:25.357 --> 40:26.840
have all that? You see? Because as I told you 
before, that I, I had thoughts for my children and

40:36.106 --> 40:40.471
for my husband. Because the advice that I gave to my 
children, I gave them to my husband. But he never

40:47.199 --> 40:50.102
took them. He forgot them. And that's why I tell my 
mother, I tell her, if I lost, and I have lost my head

40:51.664 --> 41:02.637
since I got married, just like his, I wouldn't have 
had my children, I wouldn't have known about my

41:03.832 --> 41:08.637
children, I wouldn't have known about anything. 
But no. I thought that I had to take care of my

41:10.138 --> 41:16.825
children. Yes. And I had to, if not, well, I 
couldn't have. And that's what I tell him, and I

41:20.949 --> 41:31.459
always find out with my children, with my 
daughter, Why don't they raise their family like I

41:33.177 --> 41:39.687
raised them? Because it's very nice that they say, 
as always, that it's not that they appropriate me,

41:39.707 --> 41:55.511
but always the people where we have lived have been 
envious of my family. Why do I have what I have? ¿Por

42:01.004 --> 42:02.890
qué yo tengo carro? ¿Por qué yo esto? Porque 
trabajo y mis hijos trabajan igual a mí. Y yo ando

42:08.206 --> 42:11.335
con mis hijos. All together. If I wasn't going to 
work, I wasn't going to go to work alone. No. I

42:19.363 --> 42:20.244
rested my daughter too. I was going to work, she was 
going to go. I never admitted that. Not that I was

42:25.311 --> 42:30.478
going to church alone, not that I was going to go 
with anyone. All together, all together. An

42:33.982 --> 42:41.372
American lady told us when we got to work, we were 
going to get there and they said, grab so many

42:33.982 --> 42:41.372
surcos. And they would come and grab my boys, and if 
not me, I would grab them all. And the American lady

42:49.253 --> 42:53.927
would say, look, here comes the guajolata with the 
guajolotitos.
