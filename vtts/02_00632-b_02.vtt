WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:08.141
So we're now looking into salinity power, a thing 
that's very little recognized. For instance,

00:08.842 --> 00:20.800
when that brine flows into the Colorado River and 
it's diluted, the free energy is as though that

00:08.842 --> 00:20.800
brine has fallen down a 7,000-foot dam. 
7,000-foot dam. That's high energy density. If

00:27.588 --> 00:32.073
you're going to let it get in the Colorado anyway, 
why, you might as well get the power out of it. Now,

00:32.414 --> 00:38.341
that's kind of a foolish thing, because if you're 
going to dam it up, why, you might as well shoot it in

00:32.414 --> 00:38.341
the Gulf and get the power out of it. But this is 
something we're now working on, which is salinity

00:38.401 --> 00:43.867
power. It's a totally invisible sort of power. But 
every little agricultural drainage ditch that's

00:48.292 --> 00:55.941
going into the Great Salt Lake, for instance, has a 
megawatt per cubic foot per second. is the free

00:57.119 --> 01:00.005
energy of that going into the Great Salt Lake. It's 
the highest of all the natural forms of energy.

01:02.870 --> 01:16.697
It's certainly the most concentrated, the 
natural forms of energy of that certain level, not

01:02.870 --> 01:16.697
coal or oil or

01:02.870 --> 01:16.697
lightning, of course.

01:18.213 --> 01:20.535
So we're not going to overlook it, and we're trying 
to see. It's a strange sort of energy because of the

01:21.236 --> 01:27.201
curiosities of saltwater. But that's a whole 
other subject. I don't know whether you want to go

01:31.205 --> 01:32.766
into it or not. No, I want to know one thing now. Why 
is saltwater energy? Only one thing? Well, I want

01:39.172 --> 01:41.174
to know a lot, but I want to know one thing 
immediately. Why is saltwater energy

01:41.194 --> 01:45.418
differently construed than freshwater energy? 
Oh, well, no. You've got me wrong. OK. If you take,

01:48.436 --> 01:57.804
say, brine and mix it with fresh water, but you 
could mix it with seawater because it's so much

01:48.436 --> 01:57.804
more concentrated. If you separate them by a 
semipermeable membrane, osmotic membrane, and

01:59.066 --> 02:11.497
allow this to go to equilibrium, the fresh water 
would go into this brine. And if you allow this to

02:12.478 --> 02:16.401
take place without much dilution, It would raise 
the brine 7,000 feet. You could now pour it off up

02:20.730 --> 02:24.515
there and run a Pelton well with it or something and 
generate energy. Well, this is a real expression

02:26.077 --> 02:28.140
of the free energy. The peculiarity about the 
thing is that if you release that much energy in a

02:28.901 --> 02:38.012
reaction like putting brine with fresh water 
together, you would expect it to heat up. If you

02:40.055 --> 02:42.438
release that much energy, the energy's got to go 
somewhere. You'd expect it to heat up, but it

02:42.999 --> 02:44.801
doesn't. The temperature changes 
automatically. essentially nothing. And that's

02:48.926 --> 02:52.109
because of the peculiarities of the substance 
sodium chloride. Sodium chloride has a strange

02:52.550 --> 02:54.813
property. Almost nothing else has it. And that is 
that it produces

02:58.016 --> 03:11.071
disorder in the water at just about the rate it 
releases energy. So it all goes into what's called

03:11.111 --> 03:13.354
entropy. Now, if the Great Salt Lake had been 
anything other than sodium chloride, let's say it

03:15.545 --> 03:27.025
had been magnesium sulfate, people on their inner 
tubes floating down the little streams in the

03:15.545 --> 03:27.025
Great Salt Lake would have burned their ears off. 
Or if it had been something else, ammonium

03:28.387 --> 03:34.718
nitrate, God forbid, or ammonium sulfate. Yeah, 
ammonium sulfate. There are frozen errors. There

03:37.281 --> 03:40.684
have been big temperature changes when that fresh 
water flowed in. Nobody would ever doubt that

03:41.025 --> 03:42.987
there was plenty of energy. But because sodium 
chloride is the dominant ion, there's a dominant

03:43.588 --> 03:58.485
molecule in there, electrolyte in there, what 
happens is that the energy is soaked up into

03:43.588 --> 03:58.485
increasing heat capacity at just the rate it's 
made. And so it doesn't appear as temperature.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.992
It's there perfectly well in a different form. All 
we have to do is learn how to utilize it. It's a

04:07.553 --> 04:09.136
tremendous lot. You see, all of the Midwest is 
underlain by brines, as you may know. And there's

04:13.783 --> 04:18.771
also Texas, as God knows, your oil wells. When do 
they quit drilling? When they hit brine. And that

04:22.437 --> 04:31.131
all is a power source, every bit of it, and by no 
means an inconsiderable one.

04:34.739 --> 04:43.146
Did you first become interested in the issue of 
food and food expansion through the ocean when you

04:34.739 --> 04:43.146
were in Pakistan? No, I've always been more or less 
interested in it. For a long time, yeah. I was 62, I

04:49.411 --> 04:52.594
think. When did you interview Ravel? Oh, over the 
July the 4th weekend. You did, huh? Yeah. He's an

04:57.899 --> 04:59.660
interesting guy, a great guy. At his home? Yeah. 
Yeah. No, I was... What I want to know is what, as a

05:04.625 --> 05:20.924
man involved in oceans, looking and has been 
looking a long time at things like food

05:04.625 --> 05:20.924
production, mariculture, what was the impact on 
you psychologically in an underdeveloped

05:04.625 --> 05:20.924
country for the first time like Pakistan? Well, 
that wasn't exactly the first time I'd been in that

05:20.944 --> 05:30.075
country.

05:32.873 --> 05:35.457
Your reaction to a country like that, of course, is 
very complicated. And one can spend hours talking

05:35.857 --> 05:41.605
about that one subject. A little peculiar, isn't 
it? There is so much misery. There's so much

05:49.416 --> 05:50.357
poverty. And people accept it so well. The most 
frightening thing, probably, about India and

05:54.683 --> 06:01.513
Pakistan is how fast you can get used to it. I mean, 
you shouldn't be able to get used to it. You should

06:04.824 --> 06:08.949
not be able to get used to it. Yet, you know, these 
people are not without their total

06:08.989 --> 06:14.975
disadvantages. I mean, without all the 
advantages in some way. You look at all the

06:20.141 --> 06:22.984
crippled people in that country and the defective 
people. You see them on the streets, and you're

06:23.204 --> 06:25.386
horrified by it. What do we do with our defective 
people in the United States? We hide them. They

06:29.489 --> 06:31.031
have a hell of a poor time, don't they? They're old 
people, the old crippled people, the insane

06:31.071 --> 06:33.894
people. They're all hidden somewhere. I mean, 
even people just with bad facial scars. They're

06:37.919 --> 06:38.359
hidden. That country, those people, at any rate, 
have a better time, don't they? They're with

06:43.325 --> 06:44.186
society. And those are kind of interesting 
points, it seems to me. The United States has such a

06:49.412 --> 06:52.896
culture of perfection, you see. You really can't 
even be bald, much less have your nose missing. or a

07:00.438 --> 07:05.604
disfiguration, crippled iron or something. That 
country, those people live much freer lives. So as

07:08.608 --> 07:17.919
I say, what would our society look like if we really 
left all of our people on the streets and accepted

07:08.608 --> 07:17.919
them? Quite different. And the old people, the old 
crippled people, that would be on the streets in

07:24.721 --> 07:30.488
India and Pakistan are hidden away in our country 
and living miserable lives. OK. As a matter of

07:31.609 --> 07:35.895
fact, I was talking to a Texan on the airplane just 
about that the other day. I said, well, you sure got

07:38.117 --> 07:39.399
a point there. He said, never thought I would. 
Yeah.

07:46.668 --> 07:49.311
Remind me, does this turn your work into a I've been 
to India quite a bit because my sister lived there

07:50.810 --> 07:57.616
for 20 years or 18 years, yeah. And? In India. In 
what capacity? Well, her husband was an

08:01.579 --> 08:12.849
architect, and she's an artist, and they built 
buildings and designed buildings and built

08:01.579 --> 08:12.849
schools. They built the University of Karachi and 
the Institute of Buddhist Studies at... at the

08:20.965 --> 08:25.391
heavens in Burma. And quite a number of structures 
throughout India. And I used to visit there

08:28.835 --> 08:32.480
occasionally, or visit them. So I was not totally 
unacquainted with that area.

08:38.628 --> 08:42.833
OK. Now, in 1968, I had bootstrap course. Oh, yeah. 
That was kind of fun. And a statement of fact, are

08:46.615 --> 08:49.198
you asking me? Well, I'm asking you how it came 
about.

08:56.347 --> 08:59.251
Well, that was an idea. And I'm not so sure how well 
it's ever going to be utilized. But it was an idea of

09:03.016 --> 09:13.028
a car that pulled itself down without these 
tremendous weights that you use for car barrels.

09:13.548 --> 09:15.890
and took a long core with a very light core. I think 
it's the only core that ever took a core that

09:15.930 --> 09:20.674
weighed much more than the device itself. And it's 
just an interesting configuration of a core, it

09:22.015 --> 09:43.234
seems to me, that is not without merit for taking

09:22.015 --> 09:43.234
very long cores to the ocean bottom with simple 
equipment so that you don't have to have these

09:22.015 --> 09:43.234
immense winches, very large cores.

09:48.158 --> 09:53.146
Now,

09:48.158 --> 09:53.146
it seems to me that in more recent years... I'd like 
your wife's opinion on that. I'll write you and

09:54.909 --> 09:57.833
tell you as a matter of fact. It appears that in 
recent years you've published more on marine

09:57.853 --> 10:07.048
biology problems, such as fisheries and 
productivity. That was the reason for my question

10:07.068 --> 10:09.632
about Pakistan. Why a turn in this direction? 
Well, I don't think it's a turn, exactly. It's a

10:14.937 --> 10:19.221
culmination of some ideas that I've been working 
on for quite a few years. Different theories,

10:21.843 --> 10:26.488
alternate theories of food webs, how they're put 
together. The marine biologist, are you on? Yes.

10:29.711 --> 10:38.779
The marine biologist suffers from, I think, the 
delusion that he can see everything that goes

10:29.711 --> 10:38.779
forth, that goes on in the ocean. Given enough... 
plankton nets, enough ships, enough graduate

10:40.049 --> 10:46.417
students, and one thing or another, you can trace 
what happens to the food material in the ocean. I

10:46.857 --> 10:48.500
think that's totally a delusion. You can't do it. 
The food web is far too complicated. Just take the

10:55.448 --> 10:59.974
curious case of reproductive products. Every 
adult creature in the ocean is throwing out eggs

11:02.497 --> 11:07.423
and sperm, which account for maybe 50% of the 
potential growth of that population. And it's all

11:11.487 --> 11:14.851
invisibly flowing down into the food web. You see, 
we're so misled by our terrestrial experience. We

11:18.936 --> 11:26.244
think that the immediate effect of reproduction 
is to add to the adult stocks by direct transfer of

11:18.936 --> 11:26.244
biomass. That is, a cow has a calf. The calf is a 
large proportion of an adult. It feeds on paternal

11:31.210 --> 11:32.772
sources. It immediately then, after it has 
weaned, feeds on the same source that the adults

11:35.602 --> 11:41.431
feed on, and adds to the adult biomass. The ocean is 
a totally different situation, except for the

11:41.451 --> 11:45.617
marine mammals and some sharks. This isn't the way 
it is at all. The reproductive products are

11:50.004 --> 11:52.809
subtracted from the adult biomass. The eggs are 
pulled out of the adult biomass. The amount of

11:56.715 --> 12:02.183
survival of that material that comes back to the 
adult is absolutely zero. The egg that survives

12:02.753 --> 12:07.261
down here goes through the larval form, juvenile 
form, and finally becomes an adult. The survival

12:07.902 --> 12:11.648
of that egg is zero in that. So we forget that the 
ocean is in many respects opposed, opposite, than

12:11.668 --> 12:18.620
the land. Reproductive products, which are a 
major tax on all creatures, is not added to the

12:18.860 --> 12:28.997
adult biomass in the ocean, but subtracted from 
it. And I think we need these kinds of totally

12:29.365 --> 12:32.470
different viewpoints. And we need to formalize 
them in some way. And that's what I've been doing

12:34.733 --> 12:38.479
the last few years. You see, we're much misled by 
the fact that we're terrestrial creatures. The

12:46.551 --> 12:54.343
ocean is, to a great extent, a foreign and dimly 
understood system and the life in it is

12:55.657 --> 12:58.801
differently adapted. We forget those 
differences. We tend to treat it like if we were,

13:00.624 --> 13:05.911
like if we were land ecology. Is it fair to say that 
you're more optimistic about food production

13:07.513 --> 13:13.301
from the oceans than your colleagues? I don't, I 
wouldn't speak for my colleagues, but I'm quite

13:14.483 --> 13:20.431
optimistic about food production in the ocean, 
yes. I think we've got to understand that we have to

13:21.112 --> 13:23.976
act rationally. I don't think we can act as sort of a 
way of, for instance, passing a law that we must

13:24.462 --> 13:32.872
protect the porpoises. We have to first 
understand what's the relationship between

13:34.534 --> 13:37.758
porpoises and tuna. It may be in the 30 or 40 years of 
intensive tuna fishery that we've greatly

13:37.818 --> 13:43.966
stimulated the porpoise. It may be they're in all 
out of proportion. It's a marvelous to me that tuna

13:46.049 --> 13:49.693
can survive in competition of the porpoise. 
profligate, warm-blooded animal inhabiting the

13:49.943 --> 13:52.926
ocean. If you've ever seen a school of purpose to 
sweep through a gulf, it's incredible. Frothing

13:59.751 --> 14:02.133
water where they clean everything out as they go. 
Now, isn't it funny that we should, because of soft

14:02.153 --> 14:19.748
hearts or something, should now have passed a law 
that says, ah, we must do this thing, which may be

14:02.153 --> 14:19.748
the worst possible tactic, is to pull the tuna out 
without hurting the purpose, which are in direct

14:02.153 --> 14:19.748
competition with one another. Or do we know 
whether they're in direct competition? Do we know

14:22.597 --> 14:26.201
that 40 years of tuna fishery has stimulated the 
porpoise or not? Do we know that they're in

14:26.601 --> 14:29.423
abnormal abundance or normal abundance? We don't 
know. We just passed a law that says you've got to

14:30.424 --> 14:33.107
protect the porpoise. That may really extinguish 
the tuna fishery.

14:41.174 --> 14:47.760
You see, all our marine fisheries are conducted in 
this way that stimulate the unwanted species. We

14:49.495 --> 14:50.756
have no use for the porpoise. Even the Japanese can 
hardly use it. And by law now, we make a technique

14:54.940 --> 15:01.927
that reduces the wanted species and increases the 
unwanted species. I went up to British Columbia

15:03.569 --> 15:16.161
not long ago, and here they have radio advisories

15:03.569 --> 15:16.161
to the salmon fishery about where you can fish 
without getting your net full of dogfish. Now,

15:16.985 --> 15:23.231
this is the same technique as the boy that learns 
how to catch the trout out of the pond without

15:16.985 --> 15:23.231
catching a sucker, isn't he? He increases the 
suckers and decreases the trout. Now, here's a

15:26.535 --> 15:31.900
whole organization to decrease the salmon and 
increase the dogfish.

15:36.064 --> 15:38.707
You see, you've got to take the weeds. The 
fisheries in the world are conducted like a blind

15:39.047 --> 15:44.713
man who can't see the weeds in his garden. is always 
pulling up the corn instead of the weeds, and then

15:45.301 --> 15:56.216
wondering why he's got less and less corn each 
year.

15:56.236 --> 15:58.980
So are you suggesting, then, that more study ought 
to be done? Well, I'm just trying to point out these

15:59.140 --> 16:07.152
viewpoints, which are different than the 
conventional, the traditional way in which

15:59.140 --> 16:07.152
people have gone to look at these things. Many 
people say that fishing is already an optimal.

16:11.103 --> 16:16.910
that the ocean cannot produce many more 
fisheries, that fisheries are very inefficient.

16:16.930 --> 16:21.135
It depends on what level you do this, of course, 
doesn't it? And what level you conduct your

16:21.155 --> 16:22.837
fisheries. We're conducting, if you were to look 
at it in terrestrial terms, we're conducting our

16:24.499 --> 16:32.508
fisheries now as though we were trying to feed the 
human race on tigers. It just takes too god-amany

16:33.509 --> 16:36.253
cows to feed the tigers, doesn't it? Actually, 
we're probably even higher than that. Whatever

16:38.215 --> 16:39.717
eats tigers, I've forgotten. Is there anything? 
We're conducting our fisheries at that level.

16:48.959 --> 16:52.925
No tribe in this right mind ever tried to feed 
itself on tigers. Took too many deer or buffalo or

16:54.107 --> 16:57.592
whatever it was. So the closer we get down to things 
like the Anchiveta fishery and Drew and so forth,

16:59.434 --> 17:09.088
the larger and larger, and the more we go towards 
the juveniles. The mortality of these things in

17:09.108 --> 17:11.772
the ocean is so great that probably we are 
justified in taking juvenile. But the thing we do

17:18.422 --> 17:23.189
have to do is see what the effects of our fishery are 
on the competitors. We're always stimulating the

17:25.111 --> 17:30.399
competitors of what we want to catch. Those kind of 
things have to be pointed out. Yet the law is so

17:33.663 --> 17:40.172
indirect that there's really no way to have any 
flexibility, you see. There is no way to set up a

17:41.570 --> 17:52.245
commercial fishery that really trims and 
controls a fishery in multi-species modes that it

17:41.570 --> 17:52.245
should. There's no theory to handle it. I tried to 
develop a theory, and it looks like it might make

17:53.868 --> 17:58.034
some sense.

18:03.061 --> 18:05.805
What was joint task force number one? to whom you 
submitted numerous secret reports. That was the

18:09.469 --> 18:13.936
Joint Task Force bikini hunt. First test. Abel and 
Baker test. Now much of the material you published

18:18.823 --> 18:26.956
from 45 to 47 from Berkeley was related to the 
physical surveillances of beaches along the

18:18.823 --> 18:26.956
Pacific. Was this defense information for 
amphibious landings primarily? Well, it was more

18:32.279 --> 18:33.440
general than that. It was trying to understand the 
nature of beaches and amphibious landings

18:33.460 --> 18:44.053
wherever it was, not defending the Pacific coast 
against amphibious landings, no, but rather

18:33.460 --> 18:44.053
guarding our own amphibious landing. Could you 
describe any work that you did on sea mines that's

18:45.555 --> 18:49.380
no longer classified? What were you? Oh, boy.

18:55.687 --> 18:56.088
Let's see. Can I come up with that?

19:04.814 --> 19:12.263
Well, as I said very early, there's quite a bit I 
can't certainly still classify. Quite different

19:14.185 --> 19:16.127
ideas about sea mines.

19:19.411 --> 19:31.345
One thing I can say is I took almost a year off back in 
1952 or so, 53 maybe, to study land mines.

19:32.641 --> 19:40.489
under the theory that landmine is essentially the 
same kind of a weapon as a sea mine, except it has the

19:32.641 --> 19:40.489
ability to evolve much more rapidly. Every Texas 
farmer that gets into the army thinks he can go out

19:40.509 --> 19:51.000
and play around with some primacord and 
explosives and develop a new landmine, and nobody

19:40.509 --> 19:51.000
in their right mind fiddles around with a sea mine. 
There you're talking about you're

19:51.501 --> 19:56.005
on a ship. You can't possibly screw around being 
innovative. with 300 pounds of TNT. But everybody

20:04.301 --> 20:10.246
feels they know something about landmines and 
they can make innovation. And there are some

20:10.387 --> 20:13.569
tremendous innovations in landmines. In fact, 
they'd have near beat us in Korea and in

20:14.250 --> 20:23.878
Vietnam also. The innovations were tremendous. 
What I was trying to see was Does this evolution of

20:30.590 --> 20:37.240
landmines have a forecasting ability on the 
evolution of sea mines? Are some of these

20:37.320 --> 20:51.721
technologies that were developed and which were 
so extremely difficult to combat that were

20:37.320 --> 20:51.721
developed with landmines by small-scale 
innovation transferable to sea mines? I thought

20:51.741 --> 20:54.825
that was a reasonably good contribution I made on 
that subject. And here you have an evolutionary

20:56.206 --> 21:10.219
sequence that you can begin to understand and what 
the steps have been between measures and

20:56.206 --> 21:10.219
countermeasures and counter-countermeasures 
and so forth. See if those were transferable into

21:10.239 --> 21:13.101
the ocean, and indeed they are. Is nuclear 
blasting to form harbors and channels still a

21:15.243 --> 21:19.547
feasible idea? Oh, sure. The Russians have been 
doing it, of course. It's not a feasible idea for

21:27.070 --> 21:29.893
the United States to do. I think the French might do 
it to

21:29.913 --> 21:36.782
make harbors. Those great harbors of Bikini, I 
rode around in one of them two weeks after the

21:38.184 --> 21:45.092
blast. Beautiful, vast, blue harbors that make 
supertankers... A reality. Bring in a 200-foot

21:55.885 --> 22:00.793
draft ship and it can be made like that. But the 
whole plowshare program was conducted with such

22:02.296 --> 22:14.095
insensitivity, I think, that it does not become a 
possibility for the United States to proceed in

22:02.296 --> 22:14.095
any way. You know, they were going to blast a 
channel through the Sierra Nevadas to let the smog

22:14.856 --> 22:21.867
out of Los Angeles or Start out with blasting a new 
sea level canal through Panama. Things that

22:28.735 --> 22:30.076
scared people to death. Were you involved, by the 
way, with that plan to open up a new Panama Canal? To

22:36.303 --> 22:38.085
some extent, yeah. Did you think it were a feasible 
idea? From

22:40.127 --> 22:44.251
an engineering standpoint? Yeah, from an 
engineering standpoint. Of course. From an

22:47.355 --> 22:49.457
engineering standpoint, from a social 
standpoint. From a social engineering

22:50.129 --> 22:54.655
standpoint, it was idiocy.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.481
You've got to start out small on something like 
that. You know what I want to do? I want to take my

23:01.924 --> 23:10.554
family and go out to Bikini and live around the 
edges of the crater out there and take some

23:01.924 --> 23:10.554
National Geographic-type articles and live on 
the lip of a nuclear crater. This great mile and a

23:10.995 --> 23:15.040
half It was 300 feet deep. There was new fish coming 
in, new corals, new development in one thing or

23:17.172 --> 23:21.917
another. That was kind of the way that one wanted to 
feed this into the social system. A National

23:28.043 --> 23:36.452
Geographic harbor of a family of scientists went 
out and lived on the lips of a bikini crater. That

23:36.472 --> 23:37.993
would have made sense to me. To me, too. What 
happened to that idea? I didn't get anywhere with

23:39.795 --> 23:41.517
it.

23:46.340 --> 23:52.191
In fact, some of my best writing is undoubtedly in 
proposals that never got funded. My most

23:54.275 --> 23:59.585
persuasive, my most thoughtful, my most 
penetrating writing is lost in proposals.

24:02.971 --> 24:03.092
There. OK. What is the future of deep sea ports? 
Open sea ports? Open sea ports. Oh, well, of

24:09.123 --> 24:09.664
course. As far as petroleum and liquid fuels and 
things like that, it's gigantic. That's where

24:14.381 --> 24:15.943
it's all going to be conducted. Ships are going to 
be built at sea, are being built at sea, assembled

24:16.284 --> 24:22.194
at sea at any rate, and they're never going to touch 
shore. You consider this inevitable? It's not

24:25.099 --> 24:26.681
only inevitable, it's here.

24:31.329 --> 24:34.234
What about the idea of the proposed sea dock in the 
Gulf? I don't know. Anything about the sea dock in

24:35.144 --> 24:36.766
the Gulf? Well, the concept of- Is that a 
physician? A hospital? Hospital. So in other

24:43.596 --> 24:52.189
words, is it fair to say that you see these docks 
being built for the transport of oil in places like

24:43.596 --> 24:52.189
the Gulf here and the Gulf of California? I don't 
know if they're going to be docks. They're going to

24:53.271 --> 24:56.375
be monobuies of some sort, I think. Why should they 
be docks? But I see no reason. Well, one thing I

24:59.780 --> 25:01.122
really don't understand. You can perhaps 
elucidate me. Huh? What is the tremendous virtue

25:04.403 --> 25:07.047
of a free port? I mean, look at Hong Kong. Well, of 
course, now it's a special case because it's an

25:09.772 --> 25:14.920
outlet of goods from mainland China. But free 
ports around the world prosper tremendously.

25:19.868 --> 25:22.332
What happens if you have a free port right in the 
middle of the ocean somewhere? All the ships have

25:22.352 --> 25:24.034
to come in and trade goods. You can have a nuclear 
power plant there to run it. It's a big enclosed

25:27.099 --> 25:28.301
thing. You can do some have some fisheries, all 
kinds of things you can do that would not be

25:30.880 --> 25:44.121
accepted in coastal waters, like the release of 
fisheries waste and so on, nuisance level of

25:30.880 --> 25:44.121
nuclear waste. And you can have a free port. Is 
there virtue in having just a free port out in the

25:45.583 --> 25:53.255
middle of the ocean somewhere where people can 
trade without tax?

25:53.275 --> 25:53.715
What is it? I'm not sure countries can move any 
longer to free trade. I'm not sure countries can

25:58.690 --> 26:01.595
move any longer to free trade. They can. I'm not 
sure that's economically feasible for

26:02.516 --> 26:05.160
countries. Well, very few of them have... Well, 
export limits are much fewer than import limits.

26:10.889 --> 26:18.902
So, in principle, you can have some sort of free 
trade in the middle of the sea. Is this an idiotic

26:19.302 --> 26:20.424
idea? No. You don't think so? No. What about 
spillhouses, cities on the sea? I think that's all

26:27.918 --> 26:29.380
fun. And John Craven, too, of course, is working on 
this. That's all great fun. I don't know why people

26:33.526 --> 26:36.090
want to live there. I can count a billion places 
where you could sit down in Los Angeles and never

26:36.531 --> 26:44.283
find it again, but most of the world is 
uninhabited, as you well know. It's only these

26:44.323 --> 26:51.293
coastal strips that is covered over by this 
incrustation of human beings.
