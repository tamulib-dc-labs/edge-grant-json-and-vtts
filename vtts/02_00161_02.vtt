WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:16.549
In fact, he even suggested, which let everybody 
know he was serious, why don't we just really

00:02.697 --> 00:16.549
curtail admissions to the College of Engineering 
until we get them some more space.

00:19.111 --> 00:21.734
What was their reaction to that proposal? Not too 
good. They wanted things to keep growing. And I

00:28.199 --> 00:32.383
think some had visions that someday we might catch 
up to the University of Texas. I keep worrying that

00:33.477 --> 00:40.410
that is their goal. If you could determine the 
enrollment in engineering here without having to

00:40.891 --> 00:54.736
explain it to anyone, what total would you set? You 
mean now? On now?

01:00.123 --> 01:02.846
I wouldn't have it quite as high as it is now. I 
wouldn't either. Now, that would mean I wouldn't

01:04.308 --> 01:10.796
have to explain it to the voter because that would 
be very difficult. Are there other regents that

01:10.856 --> 01:14.881
were also strong supporters of Renzi? Well, there 
were ones thinking about it, but they never

01:14.941 --> 01:19.126
verbally supported it strongly. But, of course, I 
left the room, there was lots of discussion, and

01:19.166 --> 01:24.392
then they got Mr. Powell, from the physical plan in 
they started talking about things as a result of

01:24.862 --> 01:49.131
that you can almost count the buildings around 
here you know this building engineering physics

01:24.862 --> 01:49.131
building uh... that new petroleum building the 
new building that's uh... for aerospace

01:24.862 --> 01:49.131
computing and so forth quite a few popped up but i 
think space is still a little bit of a problem

01:24.862 --> 01:49.131
because Were there some important gifts, either 
equipment or funding, during those years? Well,

01:54.798 --> 02:00.304
probably one of the biggest gifts that helped a lot 
was from Mr. Zachary on computing. He thought we

02:00.564 --> 02:08.453
ought to be up-to-date in computing, and so he made 
several significant discs. Now, was that H.B.

02:09.454 --> 02:09.855
Zachary? Yeah, Pat Zachary. Pat Zachary. Yeah. 
Let's see, any legislators that you remember as

02:13.979 --> 02:18.865
being helpful? No, there were never any problems, 
but nobody that really stood up and hollered for us

02:20.920 --> 02:29.729
or anything like that. During your years as dean, 
what relations, if any, did you have with the

02:31.691 --> 02:37.698
University of Texas Engineering program? Oh, I 
knew Dean Goyna over there very well. What's his

02:40.921 --> 02:41.482
name? Goyna was dean of engineering. 
G-L-O-Y-N-A? G-L-O-Y-N-A, Goyna. And he was dean

02:48.916 --> 02:50.659
of engineering. In fact, he sent me a 
congratulation note as soon as it came out that I

02:50.760 --> 03:05.328
was dean here and we had meetings together and the 
deans of the Texas engineering schools met at

02:50.760 --> 03:05.328
least once a year, sometimes more, compared our 
notes on things. But the relationship with the

03:05.709 --> 03:10.418
University of Texas and engineering were very 
good. So there was no problem there. Lots of

03:13.841 --> 03:14.842
cooperation. Which of the engineering programs 
in the state, for which did you have the highest

03:15.623 --> 03:20.110
regard? I'm not going to ask the negative. It's 
hard to say. I think before I came here I would have

03:23.855 --> 03:36.073
said when I was in New Jersey I probably would have 
said Rice University because it's had such a good

03:23.855 --> 03:36.073
standard and controls the enrollment with the 
resources and so forth. But I found A lot of them

03:38.410 --> 03:43.117
were doing a good job, so I didn't have a leader or 
anything. During your dean years, some key

03:43.558 --> 03:48.906
faculty appointments that you look back upon with 
pride?

03:53.754 --> 03:55.997
Did we bring any new key folks? Oh, well, there's so 
many, but screened them very carefully, and

03:56.011 --> 04:09.430
everybody that got in that got through the dean's 
office was well qualified, I think, so didn't have

03:56.011 --> 04:09.430
any problems that way. mention a bunch of names, 
but they're all doing well. Of course, I was really

04:12.505 --> 04:24.800
pleased when we had this tall young man from Kansas 
that wanted to be a faculty member here after he got

04:12.505 --> 04:24.800
his degree, and that was Bud Peterson. I don't know 
whether you ever encountered him, but he Turned

04:29.086 --> 04:33.513
out very well in mechanical engineering, 
actually, although I wasn't at that time. I was

04:33.533 --> 04:41.306
over in the dean's office, and I remember having 
some fun with him because he had a little error in

04:33.533 --> 04:41.306
his resume, and I asked him about that. But anyway, 
he became department head here after a few years.

04:45.933 --> 04:54.186
Then he was an associate dean over in the dean's 
office here, and last year he left and went up to RPI

04:45.933 --> 04:54.186
as the provost. So he's moving right along. Very 
good. Summarize these, this list you gave,

04:56.947 --> 05:03.897
summarize those accomplishments. Well, I 
thought that, I hadn't mentioned it in detail to

05:06.000 --> 05:15.054
you, but I did implement an enrollment management 
plan. We just couldn't have the students coming

05:15.535 --> 05:18.259
in, flooding in like that. How did it Well, it 
worked. There were a lot of parts to it. One was

05:22.193 --> 05:25.340
admission criteria at the freshman level went up. 
The transfer students coming in at the junior

05:26.843 --> 05:32.757
level, we made that pretty difficult, too. 
Otherwise, there was a way they could make an end

05:32.817 --> 05:35.663
run around that. And then retention. And 
retention, that happened at the end of the

05:37.463 --> 05:47.115
sophomore level, whether it could go on into the 
junior or senior year or transferring to some

05:37.463 --> 05:47.115
other college, whatever they wish. And that 
worked very well. I forget what I called it. I made

05:52.802 --> 05:55.225
one mistake when I first presented it. I had to have 
the approval of the Board of Regents. I forget what

05:57.507 --> 05:58.989
I called it. I should remember that, but they 
didn't like that at all. Then I went back and called

06:01.312 --> 06:04.756
it an enrollment management plan. Well, that was 
okay. So anyway, that went through. And of course,

06:07.907 --> 06:18.077
we were very active at that time in engineering, 
recruiting National Merit Scholars, because I

06:07.907 --> 06:18.077
found that every one you brought in, there were 
other students in the school that came along. So it

06:18.177 --> 06:19.578
really helped us. And in 1982, we had 189 of them. 
And then we started up computer science, I

06:24.562 --> 06:35.432
mentioned, and got the graduate enrollment going 
along, introduced computer-aided instruction

06:24.562 --> 06:35.432
in pilot courses then. And then I had an assistant 
dean, Terry Schau, who also is somebody that I

06:41.504 --> 06:46.428
hired once before in the East, and he was down in 
Houston. I brought him in, and he had a very

06:47.309 --> 06:57.879
skillful way of handling minorities, and he 
started up summer enrichment programs for

06:47.309 --> 06:57.879
minorities to get them in here. In that case, he was 
bringing in high school seniors or juniors and got

06:58.559 --> 07:04.905
them interested. Many of them came back later. And 
he also, he started up the first... I think it was

07:11.491 --> 07:17.564
called the Black Engineering Society, and gave 
them a charge. Their charge was to take the

07:17.604 --> 07:25.761
incoming blacks, African Americans, and make 
sure that they worked, stayed in school. So that

07:26.342 --> 07:28.045
turned out to be very good. So that helped on the 
student side. And of course, as far as what they

07:30.290 --> 07:37.208
were taking, the curriculum, all of our programs 
went through accreditation well. Engineering

07:38.110 --> 07:46.712
Technology was an interesting program to me 
because when I first came here, it seemed to be

07:46.692 --> 08:11.721
getting a lot of funding was different than a lot of 
schools and was handled on about the same level as

07:46.692 --> 08:11.721
every engineering program whereas most schools 
considered it a little bit different type and

07:46.692 --> 08:11.721
didn't require all the resources that the others 
did but anyway we restructured those programs

07:46.692 --> 08:11.721
started up a department of computer science and 
asked each department to set its five-year

07:46.692 --> 08:11.721
program goals for five years so that helped a lot 
And then with the faculty, of course, I developed a

08:13.372 --> 08:18.048
new committee structure for the college. I 
actually put out booklets so they knew who was

08:18.108 --> 08:24.951
doing what and the charge for each committee was 
there. and put out new guidelines for promotion

08:25.589 --> 08:29.697
and tenure because they didn't exist. Had a little 
fuss with the T's, the people on that, the head of

08:29.937 --> 08:41.298
T's, Porter, because he wanted to know the dollar 
amount of every research account that came in. I

08:41.318 --> 08:44.965
said, no, I just want to know if they got support and 
in what area. The forms were made out that way. We

08:48.103 --> 08:50.987
got these mid-year salary increases that I 
mentioned. And then with the computer, we got new

08:51.969 --> 08:55.433
computer equipment. Fortunately, we got outside 
funding to pay for that. And then I made a study,

08:59.499 --> 09:08.471
which it turned out...

08:59.499 --> 09:08.471
Don't worry. No problem. It turned out that... I 
studied what we had in terms of dollars here for

09:13.936 --> 09:30.662
equipment and then compared that to some national 
information I had and then the other Texas deans

09:13.936 --> 09:30.662
got involved and we calculated up for the whole 
state. And then I wrote a short note which appeared

09:31.098 --> 09:36.769
in American Society of Engineering Education. So 
then we had a $1 billion shortage for the state of

09:36.809 --> 09:40.577
Texas. And then the legislature got busy on that. 
And I was no longer dean when the money started

09:43.904 --> 09:47.431
coming through. But money came through for 
equipment funds and so forth to bring us up to date.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.401
And while I was here, of course, we had national 
meetings here. I got the Engineering Council for

09:56.582 --> 10:01.449
Professional Development for accreditation to 
meet here. We had the ASE annual conference,

10:01.990 --> 10:06.437
American Society of Engineering Education. That 
was in 82. Brought a lot of people to campus which

10:09.382 --> 10:12.867
wouldn't normally have come here. And then we 
started a memorandum of agreement with a German

10:13.825 --> 10:19.973
university where I knew some people. So we started 
exchanging some students, had their faculty

10:20.093 --> 10:24.378
coming over here. It's been very productive over 
the years and worked out very well. In fact, many

10:28.844 --> 10:40.238
faculties told me that they liked having those 
German students in their graduate classes

10:28.844 --> 10:40.238
because it showed the American students what kind 
of competition they'd be up against. Of course,

10:40.218 --> 10:45.251
they were carefully selected by this German 
university to be the best, but that worked out

10:40.218 --> 10:45.251
well. And then we started an alumni honors 
program, which I mentioned to you earlier, and we

10:46.173 --> 10:55.476
had an engineering development council, which 
involved off-campus people. and I was surprised

10:56.620 --> 11:12.655
there were no annual reports or anything for the 
College of Engineering that could be circulated

10:56.620 --> 11:12.655
nationally because I was used to in most cases in 
the past I'd always get a few annual reports from

10:56.620 --> 11:12.655
leading colleges of engineering so we produced 
the first report of the college And we decided it

11:12.635 --> 11:17.666
was quite an effort to do it and do all the other 
things while we do it every two years. So two of

11:17.767 --> 11:22.337
those reports went out while I was dean on a 
national mailing basis. Nice color brochures

11:22.437 --> 11:27.268
showing what we were doing, what was up to date, and 
so forth. And then the last item, one that I wanted

11:28.177 --> 11:37.105
to mention, was they started an engineering 
industry teaching program to bring

11:28.177 --> 11:37.105
practitioners onto campus. And this was also 
through the help of Pat Zachary. He funded some

11:39.528 --> 11:56.584
money, something special thing where he had made 
some money in South America, and he endowed that so

11:39.528 --> 11:56.584
that we'd have money to bring somebody in from 
industry for a few weeks or longer and participate

11:39.528 --> 11:56.584
in our program to give more of the industrial 
flavor to the students and faculty. And I thought

11:56.704 --> 11:58.065
that was very good. As you look back on those years, 
can you think of any opportunities that we missed,

11:59.868 --> 12:07.465
oversight?

12:10.820 --> 12:13.343
No, I can't really. As I said, when I came here, one 
of the things that attracted me was the challenge.

12:17.408 --> 12:25.877
I knew there was a lot to be done, and it kept me busy, 
and I ended up with an exceptionally good team in my

12:17.408 --> 12:25.877
office. I kept referring to it as a basketball 
team. You didn't have to look before you threw the

12:28.180 --> 12:30.042
ball. They all knew what they were supposed to do. 
So I'd say no opportunities that we really missed.

12:38.444 --> 12:46.331
Describe, if there was such, describe a typical 
day for the Dean of Engineering during that time.

12:46.631 --> 12:53.457
What time did you get here and normally what kinds 
of activities would the dean have to get involved

12:46.631 --> 12:53.457
in? Yeah, I wish there was a typical day, but I don't 
recall that there was one, but I always got here

12:53.637 --> 12:59.042
very early in the morning. I'd be in before the 
secretaries like quarter of eight or something

12:59.102 --> 13:06.949
like that and see what was laying on the desk. But 
then the day would be very full. I tried to get out of

13:10.939 --> 13:22.930
the office a lot and visit the other departments 
because only some of the departments at that time

13:10.939 --> 13:22.930
were in the Zachary Building and see what was going 
on. have a lot of paperwork to take care of because

13:23.787 --> 13:35.943
due to some strange circumstances, for a while we 
did not have any sort of a financial helper in the

13:23.787 --> 13:35.943
dean's office. We had a Mr. Fenner who did a good 
job, but then he was unhappy that the

13:36.023 --> 13:45.576
reorganization wasn't being carried out to 
improve, so he left. So we had to do that ourselves.

13:48.422 --> 13:58.002
I had to work it out with some secretaries and make 
sure that all the proper financial forms were

13:48.422 --> 13:58.002
filled out and handled so that the money was spent 
properly and appropriately. So that kept me busy.

14:00.912 --> 14:12.510
going on to a typical day, there'd always be some 
people to meet with, and I gave the secretary, my

14:00.912 --> 14:12.510
secretary, blocks of time where she could 
schedule people, but there were other blocks

14:00.912 --> 14:12.510
where she could not because I had to get work done. 
But I'd keep working, and it'd usually be 7.30 or 8

14:13.171 --> 14:20.082
o'clock at night before I'd go home and then have 
dinner with my wife. How often did you get a call

14:20.422 --> 14:25.570
from a board, directly from a regent? I don't think 
I ever did. Legislator? No, never got a direct call

14:30.644 --> 14:32.728
like that. I often got direct calls from newspaper 
people. About what? Oh, about anything that they

14:38.096 --> 14:41.561
thought might be worth the media getting involved 
in. You're meaning reporters? Yeah, reporters,

14:42.743 --> 14:45.107
right. But there were no big... There was no big 
pressure coming the other way. No big front page

14:48.732 --> 14:50.034
story? No, no. And no catastrophes, accidents? 
during those years were there? No, no. I was lucky

14:59.967 --> 15:00.668
that way. How much time did you have to spend out of 
town? How much time on the road? Well, I

15:06.158 --> 15:17.258
would say four

15:06.158 --> 15:17.258
or five days every month, something like that. 
There were contacts I had to make on behalf of the

15:17.558 --> 15:24.626
college, fortunately a lot of them in Texas and 
Dallas or San Antonio. San Antonio was a hard place

15:24.906 --> 15:29.992
to get to because it takes time, but then Houston. 
But also in New York City and I went out to Seattle

15:30.573 --> 15:47.532
quite a bit because I had some other friends in 
Boeing out there and the University of Washington

15:30.573 --> 15:47.532
and I got Boeing to make some contributions at the 
right time when we needed things, so that helped

15:30.573 --> 15:47.532
out. In a way, I didn't spend too much time away, but 
here was very, very challenging and sometimes

15:47.512 --> 16:06.413
very tiring because what schedule I told you, that 
held six days a week, except on the sixth day there

15:47.512 --> 16:06.413
weren't any secretaries around, so I could really 
get through a lot of that mail that piled up.

16:08.095 --> 16:13.401
Unfortunately, or fortunately, I don't know, I 
had a secretary that was brand new. and I had

16:13.870 --> 16:27.728
trouble teaching her between to make piles you 
know things that had to be taken care of right away

16:13.870 --> 16:27.728
things that could wait a little bit and things that 
were absolutely junk mail but uh... so I tackled

16:13.870 --> 16:27.728
some of those piles but the junk mail and the other 
stuff sometimes wait till Saturday when it could

16:27.944 --> 16:32.949
just tear through that stuff. During those 
leadership years, what were some of the high

16:33.709 --> 16:41.376
points, the most proud moments? Well, I think that 
one of the ones was when we have a group like the

16:41.697 --> 16:56.250
Board of Directors of the Accreditation Board, 
the National Accreditation Board, beat here, and

16:41.697 --> 16:56.250
we have them here for a couple days to see directly 
what's going on, and they're liking things.

16:56.290 --> 16:57.411
That's good. And also when we had the American 
Society for Engineering Education here, Jim Earl

16:57.391 --> 17:05.722
did the main job of arranging everything. I don't 
recall the number, but we probably had about 1,500

17:05.842 --> 17:14.013
or 2,000 educators from around the United States 
here at that time. And that did us a lot of good.

17:16.295 --> 17:23.685
Every year after that, I'd bump into somebody who 
said, oh, down at A&M, that was so good. They stayed

17:23.665 --> 17:26.809
in the dorms and we had lots of student activity. 
The students were typical Aggies, very kind to

17:26.849 --> 17:30.033
everybody. The students ran buses for them around 
campus where they had to go. Lots of good

17:35.500 --> 17:38.143
friendships developed. Do you remember, did the 
dean ever get victimized by any kind of Aggie joke,

17:40.466 --> 17:47.395
Aggie prank?

17:51.695 --> 17:53.998
No, if he did, I didn't hear him. They kept it away 
from me, I guess. No, I never heard of anything of

17:56.601 --> 17:59.264
that sort. Of course, every dean hears a dean's 
jokes, but that's just normal procedure. Sure,

18:04.570 --> 18:07.073
sure. As you then finished your term as dean, where 
were we best and where were we not as good as you

18:07.654 --> 18:19.508
wanted us to be?

18:23.420 --> 18:29.447
Well, we still hadn't, of course, since it takes 
time to build buildings, we hadn't solved the

18:23.420 --> 18:29.447
space problem at all. And we were still short on 
faculty. The teaching loads were too high, and

18:34.993 --> 18:41.080
that definitely was not good. What we were best, 
though, was that we had a faculty that was pretty

18:42.662 --> 18:50.170
enthusiastic and highly motivated. I tried to 
talk to them a lot. keep them informed on where we

18:53.322 --> 18:57.726
were heading and see if they agreed to be heading 
there. And I think I got very good cooperation from

18:57.746 --> 19:00.129
them. All right, now I've just about run out of 
thoughts about questions. What have we not

19:05.974 --> 19:06.955
covered?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.823
You didn't have an illness problem. No. So nothing 
like that. No, I grabbed some stuff before I left

19:17.966 --> 19:21.069
here. We covered the

19:26.279 --> 19:44.061
And the enrollment, you mentioned the enrollment 
went up and research volume went up.

19:44.662 --> 19:49.527
During those years, what did you and your wife do 
for relaxation? What were your favorite

19:49.628 --> 19:53.232
avocations? Well, it was kind of difficult 
because, as you know, Dean keeps busy. But the

19:57.992 --> 20:09.725
prime thing for us was to make sure that we got 
together with the family, usually at holidays

19:57.992 --> 20:09.725
like Christmas holiday. The first Christmas we 
were here, I think all the children came in. And

20:14.370 --> 20:21.177
then as they got children themselves, they 
started to alternate because they wanted

20:14.370 --> 20:21.177
Christmas at home or at the other side of the 
family. and of course the first Christmas here I

20:21.899 --> 20:48.480
always remember that was interesting because 
after we had all these guests in then a couple times

20:21.899 --> 20:48.480
we thought we'd go out to eat but at that time all the 
restaurants were closed in town because the

20:21.899 --> 20:48.480
students were away and not many people were 
staying in town then except a few foreign students

20:21.899 --> 20:48.480
so that became a problem but that's all changed now 
now did y'all have a key church home here yes we did

20:21.899 --> 20:48.480
yeah A church home? Yes. Yeah, well, our Savior's 
Lutheran Church. And you were Lutherans before

20:53.693 --> 20:55.336
you got here? We were Lutherans before we got here, 
yeah. And we checked it out when we came down here

20:57.000 --> 21:00.427
and looked around and so forth. And who have been 
your closest personal friends? Uh... That's hard

21:06.533 --> 21:07.635
to say. I had a lot of good friends. I think probably 
when Skip Fletcher came on board since he was the

21:09.418 --> 21:17.591
associate dean, probably the closest. Okay,

21:17.611 --> 21:30.432
then as I get near the end, if you were brought in as 
the hired consultant, to advise Texas A&M's

21:30.580 --> 21:39.632
decision makers today about the College of 
Engineering, what advice would you give them?

21:43.598 --> 21:47.343
Assuming that there are no restraints on the 
advice you could offer. I

21:48.725 --> 21:59.119
probably would hit on the same thing that I watched 
over the years and that is the space for faculty.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.103
and classrooms and so forth. We need to, 
obviously, we need to modernize classrooms and

22:03.163 --> 22:06.966
things like that. But, for example, right next 
door here, two people use that office. One is

22:14.734 --> 22:19.438
former director of the Johnson Space Center, 
Aaron Cullen. Same size as this one. Because there

22:21.841 --> 22:25.644
are more offices available. So, and I think a 
serious faculty member that wants to do a good job,

22:30.655 --> 22:36.020
he ought to have a nice private office where he can. 
What about organizational structure? Would you

22:38.662 --> 22:40.023
have any advice about? No. The way it sits here, I 
guess it's fairly well organized in terms of

22:42.365 --> 22:48.791
departments and so forth. Some schools have tried 
to give that up, but I think you could do, as far as

22:48.831 --> 22:59.880
curriculum goes, you could do a lot more with the 
freshman year and so forth than we do now. How so?

23:01.013 --> 23:19.523
Well, I think you ought to make it more of a 
self-speed learning experience rather than

23:01.013 --> 23:19.523
formal instruction because a lot of the students 
are ready to do that, where they become the one that

23:01.013 --> 23:19.523
decides how fast they learn. That can be done by the 
right kind of lecture techniques or by computers.

23:24.331 --> 23:28.017
There are lots of ways to do it, but let them move as 
fast as they want. Would you have any advice about

23:28.098 --> 23:35.465
enrollment size for the college? Too big. Too big 
for the faculty and resources. What number would

23:39.649 --> 23:42.511
you suggest they consider? Well, I'd say probably 
around 8,000 would be fine, yeah. And instead of

23:46.375 --> 23:47.536
10? Instead of 10, something where they are now, 
yeah. Would you have limits for each of the majors

23:51.239 --> 23:54.823
in that eight? Yeah, I think it should be... keep 
them comparable in size so that the person, you

23:57.545 --> 24:05.106
wouldn't have one department that's dominating. 
What about the relative emphasis of the

24:05.648 --> 24:09.097
undergraduate and the graduate? Well, I think 
that We really ought to put more emphasis on

24:12.682 --> 24:20.709
graduate right now than we are doing because in 
today's world, you almost need that master's

24:12.682 --> 24:20.709
degree, period. PhD is not essential for 
everybody by any means, but master's is getting

24:21.450 --> 24:27.915
almost essential. And the administrative 
organizational structure, what would be the

24:27.935 --> 24:34.881
relationship with the dean and the experiment 
station? I don't know. Well, I like the kind of

24:36.443 --> 24:42.688
arrangement they have now where there's one dean 
that has all that under control. but like and

24:42.668 --> 25:00.593
you've been president and administrator at many 
levels I think that sometime rather we've got to

24:42.668 --> 25:00.593
measure not only the student-faculty ratio but 
the student-administrator ratio and

24:42.668 --> 25:00.593
administrators have grown like mad and For 
example, when I was dean, we started up this

25:01.096 --> 25:10.781
program with Germany, an exchange program for 
faculty and students, ran smooth, never got money

25:01.096 --> 25:10.781
from anywhere else or anything like that. Now, I 
don't know, we've gotten this associate provost,

25:10.821 --> 25:15.493
I guess, international fairs couple of assistant 
provosts for the same thing you know and it seems

25:15.710 --> 25:41.633
like we have a lot of people there now why is that a 
problem well of course it takes resources but also

25:15.710 --> 25:41.633
the faculty get tired of getting these 
questionnaires from some provost that has

25:15.710 --> 25:41.633
minimum responsibilities and must want to fill up 
a file cabinet or something with returns I would

25:15.710 --> 25:41.633
check that student administrative ratio Do you 
have any engineering programs in mind that would

25:41.613 --> 25:52.482
be possibly good models for Texas A&M? Who are some 
other schools that we might want to? Well, those do

25:56.646 --> 26:10.978
change rather rapidly, but as the different 
programs have been reviewed around the country, I

25:56.646 --> 26:10.978
thought Duke was headed in the right direction as 
far as their engineering program goes. Although

26:11.819 --> 26:18.836
the first time I reviewed them, I came down hard on 
them because they weren't using computers in

26:11.819 --> 26:18.836
their classroom. That's some time ago, you know, 
and not putting enough emphasis on it. Well,

26:22.004 --> 26:23.087
that's all been changed. What about among the 
land-grant schools? Among the land-grant

26:25.573 --> 26:28.360
schools? I just visited last week up at State 
College, Pennsylvania. About the same size as us

26:35.014 --> 26:36.398
now. I was surprised, 44,000 on that campus, on the 
main campus. They seem to be very well organized,

26:40.727 --> 26:47.783
very well organized, and doing well in many of 
their programs, yeah. We used them as one of our

26:48.050 --> 26:55.117
models in the early 60s when we were dreaming of 
what A&M might become. They had already moved.

26:58.580 --> 27:03.825
They and Michigan State, and they were two of our 
college models. Let's see. What administrator or

27:06.828 --> 27:14.395
administrators would you want to say thank you, 
express appreciation to? Mike Prescott. No

27:15.877 --> 27:16.879
question about it. In fact, he wrote a little book. 
I don't know whether I can put my little pamphlet on

27:19.924 --> 27:26.014
about quality in the academic atmosphere. Once in 
a while I pull that out and show it to people. I think

27:28.257 --> 27:30.561
it's over there somewhere, a little pamphlet. But 
I think he did a lot for the university. You know you

27:33.746 --> 27:35.268
worked closely with him. Every chance he had, he 
had people remembering that we were going for

27:36.310 --> 27:39.956
quality here. We weren't second rate. All right, 
then my last question would be what feelings do you

27:42.505 --> 27:47.891
have in your heart for Texas A&M today? Oh, very 
strong. I'm up at the Notre Dame game with a couple

27:51.435 --> 27:56.860
of my, well, I should say with two sons, two 
son-in-laws. No, I feel very strong about that.

28:03.588 --> 28:07.292
I'm a converted Aggie, I guess. All right, let's 
quit with that then.

42:15.550 --> 42:17.695
When it has no sound, it stops? Yes.

42:21.545 --> 42:22.006
It has sound. One more time. It has that.
