WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:06.266
Testing, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

00:06.667 --> 00:07.949
One, two, three, four.

00:09.931 --> 00:11.534
In other words, you don't have to talk loud.

00:11.614 --> 00:29.058
This is April the 10th, and we're in the library room of Clayton Williams Building, and I have the honor and pleasure of chatting with Charlie Thomas for many years, the splendid track coach here at Texas A&M.

00:29.078 --> 00:30.780
To introduce yourself,

00:30.946 --> 00:34.489
to someone would listen to this tape or to read the transcription.

00:35.610 --> 00:44.319
Give a biographical sketch of Charlie Thomas, where was he born, grew up, went to high school, what did mom and dad do?

00:45.080 --> 00:47.482
And then where'd you go to college and what'd you do there?

00:47.682 --> 00:51.145
Just tell us as much as you can about Charlie Thomas before getting to A&M.

00:51.165 --> 00:58.152
Okay, Charlie Thomas, the history of the coach at Texas A&M from 1959 to 1970.

00:59.093 --> 01:16.249
Jim Meyers, who was the Athletic Director and Head Football Coach at Texas A&M, hired me a young 27-year-old coach out of East Texas State College and Commerce.

01:16.269 --> 01:26.198
East Texas State had won the last three Lone Star Conference Track and Field Championships, and this was my first time to receive

01:26.498 --> 01:29.883
a telephone call from Texas A&M University.

01:31.265 --> 01:44.104
They were offering me the job or come down to visit to be wanting to know if I would be interested in coaching track and being the assistant trainer at Texas A&M.

01:44.685 --> 01:53.738
Of course that's a big step going from East Texas State which is in the Lone Star Conference into Texas A&M Southwest Conference so I said of course.

01:53.718 --> 01:59.586
So I came down and visited and they offered me the job and I took it.

02:01.508 --> 02:01.909
Let's see.

02:02.409 --> 02:04.812
This is the only time we'll ask about money.

02:04.832 --> 02:07.236
What was the beginning salary?

02:07.256 --> 02:19.131
It was like at East Texas State, I think I was getting $4,300 a year, $4,300 a year.

02:19.151 --> 02:23.657
And when I came to A&M, I got a big raise from $43,000

02:24.127 --> 02:24.909
to 47,000.

02:25.670 --> 02:35.472
I'm going to give you my history about.

02:36.955 --> 02:37.917
But growing up.

02:37.997 --> 02:38.338
Right.

02:58.636 --> 03:05.124
Well, I'll just start talking.

03:05.765 --> 03:14.696
I was born in 1931 in Foster, Texas, a little sawmill town between Cut and Chute and Cleveland.

03:15.858 --> 03:18.982
It's 18 miles from Conroe.

03:19.002 --> 03:21.505
I was born on a big dining room table.

03:22.379 --> 03:28.485
inside the kitchen there at Foster Lumber Company, Foster, Texas.

03:29.827 --> 03:35.352
Of course, I started playing athletics and we didn't have a high school there.

03:37.695 --> 03:49.467
Ninth grade, they ran a school bus through this little sawmill town, one to Cleveland, which was a Class A school, and then one to Splendora, which was a Class B school.

03:49.936 --> 03:54.924
And Splendora was seven miles away, so I chose to go to Splendora.

03:56.085 --> 04:00.933
All right, of course there we played six men football and had an outdoor basketball court.

04:00.953 --> 04:03.377
We didn't have a basketball court.

04:03.397 --> 04:06.882
But anyway, I won the track meets

04:07.486 --> 04:13.753
three straight years in the 220 yard dash.

04:14.774 --> 04:18.258
I never lost a race.

04:18.578 --> 04:20.040
Who coached you?

04:20.440 --> 04:24.905
Roy Seegers, a guy named Seegers.

04:24.965 --> 04:30.731
Seegers, S-E-A-G-E-R-S.

04:31.372 --> 04:34.135
He was a senior, he was later on.

04:34.604 --> 04:45.875
My first three years I went to Splendora and then they ran that school bus through the town and we had a group would go to Cleveland and a group would go to Splendora.

04:45.895 --> 04:52.962
There was a girl getting on the bus going to Cleveland and I started going with this girl when I was a junior.

04:53.623 --> 05:01.050
So my senior year I decided to transfer and go to Cleveland, be with my girlfriend.

05:01.655 --> 05:09.412
At the same time, Conroe High School was recruiting me to go play football and go to school in Conroe, which was a 2A school.

05:10.194 --> 05:13.200
That 2A school was old days, it was a 5A school now.

05:13.973 --> 05:38.074
so I'd been recruited but Cleveland High School would also recruit me so I had Conroe and Cleveland recruit me to go to their high school and finish up and play football and basketball but anyway I transferred and went to Cleveland because of this girl and her name was Cecil Thigpen and her first name Cecil C-E-C-I-L and her daddy was the principal of that little

05:38.645 --> 05:40.955
junior high school there in Foster.

05:42.040 --> 05:46.680
So anyway, I went to Cleveland and I won state again and

05:47.015 --> 06:08.284
in track and field and ended up, then the next year I got offers to go to all these different schools and I accepted the University of Texas, Texas A&M with us after a minute, a bunch of schools after a minute because everything's a long story.

06:08.324 --> 06:11.368
I could talk all day just on a few little bitty items.

06:11.348 --> 06:23.265
Anyway, I went to the University of Texas and I got married after my freshman, well my girlfriend, her name was Cecil.

06:24.647 --> 06:29.333
I had the University of Texas recruiting me real heavy, Texas A&M recruiting me real heavy.

06:29.894 --> 06:39.988
So the baseball coach, the All-American baseball coach in Huntsville, Texas,

06:39.968 --> 06:46.054
I can't remember his name, but he's been there a long time and he had sons that come up and coached there in Conroe.

06:46.074 --> 06:50.418
But anyway, they were University of Texas graduates.

06:50.438 --> 07:00.469
This baseball coach from Huntsville's wife came over and took me and my girlfriend out for dinner and talked about us going to the University of Texas.

07:01.570 --> 07:09.958
So when it comes time to visit, this lady from Huntsville comes over and picks up me and my girlfriend.

07:10.040 --> 07:14.066
I'm saying a lot of this because I learned fast how to recruit.

07:15.007 --> 07:23.599
And then when I first got the job at Texas A&M, my number one item was to recruit the best guys you can get if you're going to have a championship team.

07:23.959 --> 07:27.144
But anyway, they put us up in the hotel.

07:27.304 --> 07:30.048
In those days, little things like that wouldn't violate the rules.

07:31.590 --> 07:33.933
So I didn't think anything about it.

07:33.973 --> 07:36.857
But later on, I signed and went to

07:37.175 --> 07:38.517
to University of Texas.

07:38.857 --> 07:44.225
And then after my first year, we get married, which is the same girl.

07:44.745 --> 07:49.031
My girl went to Texas, too, as a freshman, but didn't anybody pay her.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.513
There wasn't anything illegal about that.

07:50.974 --> 07:58.645
But anyway, we get married, and then I ran track there for four years.

07:58.665 --> 08:03.351
And the only track meet that I missed, a University of Texas

08:04.023 --> 08:05.705
was coming to Texas A&M.

08:05.725 --> 08:14.277
We had a triangle meat at A&M with rice A&M in Texas and that was standard for many years back in those days.

08:14.298 --> 08:21.728
The only track meat I missed in four years of running was that one because my daughter Patricia Ann was born that Saturday morning.

08:22.315 --> 08:36.971
And Friday night, I was up all Friday night, and at 7 o'clock Saturday morning, the baby was already morning, so I called down in the hospital, and I called Coach Clyde Littlefield and tell him the story, and he knew my wife was pregnant.

08:36.991 --> 08:38.272
He said, that's all right, that's all right.

08:38.312 --> 08:43.337
So anyway, I missed that track meet here at A&M, and that was the only one I missed while I was running.

08:44.899 --> 08:51.546
And then later on, I go to get a coaching job.

08:51.948 --> 08:57.414
Now, when you were an undergraduate at the University of Texas, what did you hope to become?

08:57.434 --> 08:58.996
What was your... All right.

08:59.457 --> 09:04.102
What started me out as being a coach was a trainer, Frank Medina.

09:04.122 --> 09:09.088
He was an Indian, old-timey trainer, and every school had great trainers.

09:09.108 --> 09:10.490
I mean, he'd been there for years.

09:10.610 --> 09:14.815
Texas A&M had great trainers, Rice and SMU.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.898
Every school had these real good trainers.

09:18.098 --> 09:21.162
We'd go to track mates in high school,

09:21.682 --> 09:27.174
One of these trainers would come and look me up to give me a rub down and all that stuff.

09:27.214 --> 09:29.037
I didn't know it, but they would recruit me.

09:30.340 --> 09:35.511
Rice trainer would come over and recruit me and give me a rub down.

09:35.551 --> 09:39.399
He would talk about how great the Rice team was and I didn't realize it.

09:39.419 --> 09:42.205
I was just a high school kid running.

09:44.395 --> 09:46.938
Oh, I forgot what we were.

09:46.958 --> 09:50.543
Well, and then when you graduated, did you graduate to East Texas?

09:50.563 --> 09:50.803
Oh, yeah.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.145
All right.

09:52.205 --> 10:02.178
Frank Medina, the trainer at Texas, came up and talked to me and Dean Smith, and Dean Smith was my roommate and ran on the relay team with me.

10:02.198 --> 10:13.693
He said, if you've got to start now, we were sophomores, and learn and be student trainers, he said, when you graduate, he said, I feel pretty sure I can get you a big job in the pros.

10:13.994 --> 10:23.529
in the pros or a major college being a trainer because he said, University of Texas is one of the very few schools that are training athletic trainers.

10:23.549 --> 10:26.413
He said, you can't go to any other school and be an athletic trainer.

10:27.295 --> 10:34.606
But you come here, we'll train you and get you pass a test and get your certificate and be a qualified trainer.

10:34.626 --> 10:37.791
So anyway, we started doing that.

10:38.092 --> 10:45.142
I remember way back there, we'd go to the Kansas Relays, go to the Drake Relays, go to the Penn Relays in a train.

10:46.524 --> 10:51.491
Two days up there and two days back, or a day and a night in a train.

10:52.833 --> 11:03.728
The trainer would take cases of tape, I mean four or five cases of tape, a two-inch tape, and we'd have to tape practice all the way up there and all the way back.

11:04.602 --> 11:07.891
And I got to where I could take two ankles in a minute and a half.

11:07.971 --> 11:13.988
I mean, to be a big time trainer, you had to turn out a football player.

11:14.356 --> 11:19.442
You had to tape their ankles like a cast where they couldn't break it, especially in the pros, I mean.

11:20.043 --> 11:39.528
But anyway, then when I graduated from Texas, the athletic director at Texas was from A&M, came from A&M, and he was coached at A&M at one national championship.

11:39.548 --> 11:39.949
DX Bible.

11:40.069 --> 11:40.549
DX Bible.

11:41.410 --> 11:41.811
All right.

11:41.871 --> 11:44.194
DX Bible was athletic director at Texas.

11:44.849 --> 11:55.680
And he called me up in the office and said, he said, East Texas State is looking for a new, looking for a head track coach and head trainer and you're qualified.

11:56.221 --> 11:58.363
So do you want the job?

11:58.443 --> 12:00.045
I said, yeah, I don't have a job.

12:00.325 --> 12:03.628
So that was my fifth year.

12:03.829 --> 12:04.890
When was that?

12:04.910 --> 12:06.291
That was actually my fifth year.

12:06.311 --> 12:08.333
So that's the spring of when?

12:08.413 --> 12:11.817
Fifty, fifty, four, fifty-five.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.257
Fifty-five.

12:12.277 --> 12:12.898
Fifty-five.

12:13.520 --> 12:34.583
My senior year was 1954 and it took me five years to get my degree and I went back and I was a full-time athletic trainer and see when I was a trainer, I mean when I was a student trainer during track season I couldn't be a trainer too much but other time I'd basketball game football games I'd work as a trainer

12:35.238 --> 12:39.568
So you and your wife and how many children by then?

12:40.690 --> 12:41.672
Just had one.

12:42.334 --> 12:44.158
You and the wife and daughter moved to Commerce.

12:44.178 --> 12:45.100
Moved to Commerce.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.202
And you were there how long?

12:46.222 --> 12:47.505
And we were there three years.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.688
Three years.

12:48.708 --> 12:49.790
You get this call.

12:50.612 --> 12:52.577
Do you know who recommended you down here?

12:52.597 --> 12:53.719
Yes, Bobby Rogers.

12:54.256 --> 12:59.104
All right, Bobby Rogers was a basketball coach at East Texas State.

12:59.224 --> 13:15.589
When I graduated and got my first job, I go up there, and Bobby Rogers is at East Texas State, and he had won some games or some conference championships, and A&M hired him.

13:16.042 --> 13:19.225
I mean, I met, he was there up to my last year.

13:19.666 --> 13:26.713
And when he went to A&M, I think Bobby Rogers was at Texas A&M one year under Jim Myers.

13:27.394 --> 13:31.318
And Jim Myers had just got here from Iowa, I think.

13:31.338 --> 13:32.078
Iowa State.

13:32.098 --> 13:32.579
Iowa State.

13:33.159 --> 13:38.625
And they were, he asked Bobby Rogers, you know any track coaches around?

13:38.645 --> 13:43.450
He said, I got to hire a track coach and I need one combination trainer.

13:43.919 --> 13:45.522
And Bob said, man, I know the guy.

13:45.782 --> 13:48.627
I know the guy at East Texas State.

13:48.667 --> 13:51.331
Said he's the head trainer and he's the head track coach.

13:51.351 --> 13:55.758
He's qualified and he's got a reputation in track, you know.

13:56.299 --> 14:01.708
Because I had run nine, I didn't tell you this, but I ran nine straight years.

14:02.583 --> 14:06.867
and never lost a race in the state of Texas in a 220 yard dash.

14:06.907 --> 14:15.336
I'd get second or third or get beat when I'd go to the Nationals or some big, but anyway, I had a pretty good reputation around.

14:15.356 --> 14:21.883
220 was your best race, but you also ran 100 and sometimes 400, didn't you?

14:21.923 --> 14:24.726
Yeah, and sometimes low hurdles, 220 low hurdles.

14:26.227 --> 14:28.770
But anyway, I got the job here at A&M.

14:28.950 --> 14:30.852
Did you come down here for an interview?

14:30.983 --> 14:33.446
Yes, I came down for an interview, me and my wife.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.728
Describe that.

14:34.748 --> 14:38.553
Well, it was over in Jim Meyers' house.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.996
Jim Meyers is the one that called me.

14:41.016 --> 14:43.420
And he had a big fancy house.

14:43.720 --> 14:44.942
And I did commerce.

14:45.022 --> 14:49.227
I had a little old rent, a little bitty small house, you know, just making it.

14:50.028 --> 14:52.992
Came down here and saw Jim Meyers' great house.

14:53.012 --> 14:55.716
And he had all the coaches.

14:55.916 --> 14:58.560
And he had a house full of people.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.282
I mean, it was a lot of people there.

15:00.953 --> 15:03.435
And I didn't know anybody but Bobby Rogers.

15:03.595 --> 15:04.576
I knew Bobby Rogers.

15:04.596 --> 15:07.018
He was A&M's head basketball coach.

15:07.038 --> 15:08.459
And we just sat around and talked.

15:08.479 --> 15:15.525
And then the next day, he took me down and took me and met Smokey Harper and met a lot of people around.

15:15.625 --> 15:18.348
And then they asked me a few questions.

15:18.368 --> 15:22.571
And the main question was, can you recruit?

15:22.671 --> 15:26.054
And I said, well, that's about all I've been doing in these tactics.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.056
I've recruited.

15:28.076 --> 15:30.758
So that's kind of what got me the job.

15:31.514 --> 15:37.242
Also, I'm wondering, did Rogers bring with him a young assistant coach?

15:37.262 --> 15:37.843
Well, no.

15:38.804 --> 15:42.829
Yeah, he hired Shelby Metcalfe.

15:43.070 --> 15:50.380
But Shelby, the deal was Shelby was coaching over there in East Texas on the river.

15:53.684 --> 15:54.425
A little bitty town.

15:54.505 --> 15:56.708
Yeah, a little bitty town.

15:57.729 --> 16:00.373
See, Rogers sent me over there

16:00.775 --> 16:04.961
talk to Shelby about something.

16:04.981 --> 16:06.003
I forget what it was.

16:06.944 --> 16:08.346
I think we were recruiting somebody.

16:08.366 --> 16:13.974
But I go to this little town and finally had to go to the high school and I said, where's Shelby?

16:14.175 --> 16:14.976
He said, Shelby.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.239
I said, yeah, the basketball court.

16:17.339 --> 16:18.621
Oh, he said, that's catfish.

16:19.442 --> 16:20.324
That's catfish.

16:20.764 --> 16:21.345
Metcalfe.

16:21.365 --> 16:22.647
Catfish Metcalfe.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.694
And Shelby spent all his time on the river fishing.

16:27.714 --> 16:29.517
He was a big river fisherman.

16:29.902 --> 16:37.915
So I go down and I meet, I go down to the river and that's where I first met Shelby Metcalf is on the river while he was fishing.

16:39.918 --> 16:52.939
When, either when you were interviewed or when you first got here, did anybody give you any directions, any guidelines, any rules about being a track coach here?

16:54.860 --> 17:01.871
Well, Bones Irving was, he was, you know, assistant athletic director.

17:01.891 --> 17:10.866
He was the head athletic director, and every time he'd move up, be the head athletic director, and when the coach come in, he'd move back down to the system, but he was running the program.

17:10.926 --> 17:14.472
He was the ruling body of the

17:15.380 --> 17:17.283
of Texas A&M in all sports.

17:17.984 --> 17:25.556
He was a business manager of what he was, but he was assistant athletic director and business manager and all that stuff.

17:25.616 --> 17:27.318
This was before they hired Wally Gross.

17:28.681 --> 17:34.510
And I remember I went in there and the first thing he told me, he said, here's how much money you can spend.

17:35.151 --> 17:37.073
On breakfast, you can spend two dollars.

17:38.155 --> 17:40.238
And on lunch, you can spend two and a half.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.602
And on supper, you can spend three dollars.

17:43.274 --> 17:47.161
He said, it doesn't matter how many you take, but you can't spend over that.

17:47.201 --> 17:54.393
And he said, you have a limit of 16 full scholarships.

17:54.413 --> 17:56.817
And he said, you can divide it up any way you want to.

17:57.178 --> 18:00.023
In those days, you'd go out like a pole vaulter.

18:00.043 --> 18:03.529
If he was a 13-foot pole vaulter, you'd try to get him for books and tuition.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.552
And you'd take one scholarship and recruit

18:05.870 --> 18:34.527
four or five guys and and that's how how it was but he said you have 16 scholarships well after about two or three years i was wondering how texas and rice and them were doing so good and i went in there and i said bones i said how many scholarships does uh texas have he said they have uh 30 31 or 33. i said what he said yeah i said how many rice have he said oh they have 28

18:35.317 --> 18:36.919
I said, and I have 16.

18:36.979 --> 18:37.580
He said, yeah.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.803
He said, but you've got more than everybody else.

18:40.823 --> 18:42.265
He said, you've got more than Baylor.

18:42.986 --> 18:44.788
Baylor has about 10 or 11.

18:45.228 --> 18:47.971
SMU and TCU don't have but six or seven.

18:48.031 --> 18:50.114
Arkansas's got about six or seven.

18:50.574 --> 18:54.859
He said, just between me and you, I said, don't ever tell nobody this.

18:54.879 --> 19:03.028
Just between you and I, we don't expect you to get any hired in third place in the Southwest Conference because we don't have enough money to do that.

19:03.532 --> 19:07.480
So, I mean, you talk about being quite, I never mentioned that to Ted Nelson or nobody.

19:07.580 --> 19:12.069
I mean, if we couldn't win with what we had, I mean, it was just bad luck.

19:12.089 --> 19:14.313
So that's one thing you had to do.

19:15.255 --> 19:22.489
I mean, you had to really figure out your scholarship, so many for how much you're going to spend on each event.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.675
See, here's the difference between track and football or basketball.

19:26.600 --> 19:42.672
You go to a track meet in olden days or any track meet, you can take 108 men on your track team and all 108 can score a point.

19:42.752 --> 19:45.958
In basketball, you've only got five that can score.

19:46.428 --> 19:48.531
But in track, I figured it out.

19:48.671 --> 19:56.864
I mean, you know, six events, you can take six different people just for the mile run, and all six of them can score a point.

19:56.884 --> 19:57.806
It's very good enough.

19:58.567 --> 20:07.120
So numbers mean a lot in track and field, but they have to be good numbers.

20:07.606 --> 20:10.170
you said they gave you some about spending.

20:11.372 --> 20:18.964
Was there anything about where you could go and couldn't go, about partying, about drinking, smoking?

20:18.984 --> 20:29.100
Yeah, we, first place, he said, now you can only fly in one plane trip visit per year.

20:29.341 --> 20:34.609
In other words, if you invite somebody from California to come down here to try out,

20:35.197 --> 20:39.082
I said, you better sign him because you can't do it again.

20:39.362 --> 20:42.786
So I went all those years with only invite one guy to fly in.

20:42.826 --> 20:52.738
So that was one reason that most everybody we recruited in those days was, you know, within driving distance where they could go back and forth because we didn't have enough money to be flying.

20:53.098 --> 21:03.651
And then when we flew to a track meet, I mean, we had to really limit it because, like, if you go to the Kansas Relays, you know, you're going to spend $7,000, $8,000, $10,000.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.506
And I don't see how they're doing it nowadays.

21:07.607 --> 21:09.409
I mean, they're taking everywhere they go.

21:09.449 --> 21:12.633
They have to fly and spend the night, and it costs money.

21:13.534 --> 21:18.661
For instance, Washington, the track coach at Washington was a real good friend of mine.

21:18.721 --> 21:19.943
He had a real good program.

21:20.484 --> 21:25.570
And for about 10 straight years, he'd call down there and offer me $5,000.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.594
And that's the way they do these.

21:28.614 --> 21:30.477
Even Texas Relays would give you money.

21:30.517 --> 21:31.879
Drake Relays would give you money.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.482
Yeah, to come to their meet, they'd give you money.

21:35.018 --> 21:46.735
And that's the main reason everybody would go to Drake in Texas and Penn Relay because they'd give you a check about $3,000, $4,000, you know, to help you pay for your expenses.

21:47.677 --> 21:52.544
But anyway, Washington, that's way up there, you know, University of Washington.

21:52.564 --> 21:57.151
They offered me $5,000 just to come up for a dual or a triangle track meeting.

21:57.512 --> 22:03.220
And boy, I wanted to go so bad, and I figured, well, it cost about $15,000 to make the trip.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.183
I'd go in there and say, Bone, I need $10,000.

22:05.303 --> 22:06.765
Oh, just forget that.

22:06.886 --> 22:14.617
He said, you can get in a school bus and you can drive over to Rice, and Rice is just as good as Washington.

22:14.638 --> 22:15.940
That was the DLC.

22:16.020 --> 22:22.409
I mean, why do you want to spend all the $10,000 to go have a track meeting in Washington when you can go to University of Houston?

22:22.429 --> 22:25.013
See, there are three schools in Houston that are just as good.

22:25.514 --> 22:30.642
You got Texas Southern, you got Rice, you got University of Houston, then you got Lamar, and then you got

22:30.622 --> 22:36.768
Prairie View A&M, you got five schools right there in one whack that's as good as anywhere in the United States.

22:37.289 --> 22:45.737
So that was kind of standard, you know, and to charter a bus, it would cost us $500 or $600 to get a Greyhound, but you know, we wasn't about to go on no school bus.

22:45.797 --> 22:48.280
I mean, we were middle class, big time.

22:48.941 --> 22:53.465
When you first got here, describe the track facilities.

22:54.146 --> 22:55.107
Okay.

22:55.127 --> 23:00.072
I was a little shocked because at A&M everything was homemade.

23:01.081 --> 23:06.529
I mean they had hurdles, all the hurdles were homemade and they were heavy and they were bad shape.

23:06.989 --> 23:15.702
I mean they were good hurdles but they were, they wasn't light and if you hit one of them it would, you'd hurt a leg or something you know.

23:16.403 --> 23:21.530
And the pole vault pit was all, they had a big mound made, you probably have seen that.

23:21.851 --> 23:22.512
That was good.

23:22.652 --> 23:27.038
I mean they had a big dirt mound made and they filled it up with sawdust.

23:27.018 --> 23:31.224
But the deal was, everybody was getting these foam rubber pits, you know.

23:33.267 --> 23:37.993
But anyway, the track, of course, they were all cinder track in those days.

23:38.093 --> 23:42.760
But A&M had, they had gone in there and put oil.

23:43.721 --> 23:46.425
Colonel Andy did that, Frank Anderson, and that was pretty good.

23:46.445 --> 23:52.854
That made the cinder track more like an all-weather track because if it rained, it didn't mess it up.

23:52.894 --> 23:55.017
But some of the track...

23:55.486 --> 23:56.567
I had more cinder.

23:56.607 --> 23:58.870
Some I was real dusty and some I was real hard.

23:58.950 --> 24:03.115
And see, that was one of my jobs my first seven or eight years here.

24:03.135 --> 24:10.963
Every day, about one o'clock, I'd go out there and hook up the tractor and drag the track and get it perfect.

24:11.063 --> 24:13.887
And then we had a homemade deal with nails sticking in it.

24:14.307 --> 24:16.249
We'd hook that to the tractor and drag it around.

24:16.269 --> 24:21.755
It'd cut a lane in the track and that marked off your lane so you could practice your relays on the turn and so forth.

24:21.836 --> 24:24.919
Well, this was, and the track in those days was inside.

24:24.983 --> 24:26.966
Inside Kyle Field, uh-huh.

24:27.687 --> 24:29.571
Was it six lanes all the way around?

24:29.591 --> 24:30.472
No, it was eight lanes.

24:30.592 --> 24:31.934
It was eight lanes.

24:31.975 --> 24:32.976
It was a good track.

24:33.076 --> 24:38.205
And a straightaway of what length?

24:38.866 --> 24:41.590
That straightaway, 220, 220 yards straightaway.

24:42.812 --> 24:49.303
And all of the field event locations were in the end zone?

24:50.482 --> 24:53.506
No, there wasn't anything.

24:54.266 --> 24:57.951
The shot put, no, they were all on the outside.

24:57.971 --> 25:04.999
They were all behind the scoreboard, the shot and discus and everything.

25:05.219 --> 25:06.561
And broad jump?

25:06.581 --> 25:07.462
It was on the inside.

25:07.502 --> 25:10.746
The pole vault and long jump was inside.

25:12.207 --> 25:17.674
And we didn't have a triple jump then, but later on we did.

25:17.734 --> 25:18.835
When you arrived,

25:19.405 --> 25:22.498
Were you following Colonel Andy immediately?

25:22.920 --> 25:23.864
Yes, uh-huh.

25:23.884 --> 25:25.551
Well, Colonel Andy had retired.

25:26.355 --> 25:27.660
He was out one year.

25:28.113 --> 25:42.493
And the reason he told me, I mean I should say this, but Colonel Andy told me the reason I retired, he said I just couldn't put up with this football anymore.

25:42.653 --> 25:55.150
Barry Bryant had come in and they had a lot of rules on football and he said they run me out of business.

25:55.130 --> 26:03.004
Yeah, he had been gone a year, and Ray Putman was the associate track coach.

26:03.044 --> 26:08.233
He was a full-time economics professor, and he didn't want the job.

26:08.253 --> 26:12.160
In fact, they didn't pay him much, and then after

26:12.629 --> 26:16.216
When I came in, I didn't even know about Ray.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.743
I started coaching and everything.

26:19.763 --> 26:22.048
Later on, he came up and talked to me.

26:22.068 --> 26:30.585
When I found out all about Ray, I invited him and said, you want to help me coach?

26:30.625 --> 26:33.591
He said, yes, I'd love to do that.

26:33.571 --> 26:36.154
So I said, okay, you're the head cross-country coach.

26:36.194 --> 26:38.998
This was after, I coached a couple years.

26:40.100 --> 26:50.353
And anyway, he was my assistant coach for two or three years before, well, all the way up until I hired Ted Nelson.

26:50.373 --> 26:51.935
And he, yeah, he was.

26:52.055 --> 26:53.397
So Putnam did the distances.

26:53.477 --> 26:56.902
Yes, he was coaching cross-country and distances.

26:57.483 --> 26:58.804
Let's go back to Colonel Andy.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.708
Describe him as much as you can.

27:02.349 --> 27:03.190
We don't know much about him.

27:03.338 --> 27:21.364
Colonel Indy was a great athlete because I remember way after he retired, he had marked off a bottom, he was a golfer, and he cleared a whole four or five golf

27:21.985 --> 27:23.748
out in the woods.

27:23.868 --> 27:30.258
He bought this little place out in the woods and he made a golf court out of it for about five holes.

27:30.778 --> 27:32.841
He did it all by himself.

27:32.862 --> 27:36.026
He'd climb up in those trees and cut the limbs out and all this and that.

27:38.710 --> 27:42.897
Frank Anderson was a great field event coach.

27:43.237 --> 27:46.001
He dominated the field events.

27:46.062 --> 27:49.647
When I got the job at Texas NM, I knew all about Frank Anderson.

27:50.453 --> 27:53.739
And I met him when, in fact, he tried to recruit me.

27:54.621 --> 27:57.988
And I had Frank Anderson trying to recruit me to come to A&M.

27:58.048 --> 28:04.721
And the main reason I went to the University of Texas was because Texas had the sprinters, A&M had the filament guy.

28:05.362 --> 28:08.007
And go back on that story about

28:08.257 --> 28:09.459
I met Dean Smith.

28:09.999 --> 28:16.909
Well, Dean Smith and I, we were running all the big high school meets our junior and senior year.

28:17.490 --> 28:22.798
Well, I would win all the 100-yard dashes and two 20-yard dashes until I run into Dean.

28:23.739 --> 28:28.185
Well, we'd go to a big track meet where Dean would win the 100 and I'd get second.

28:28.806 --> 28:30.669
I'd win the 200 and he'd get second.

28:31.050 --> 28:33.313
So we made real good friends battling each other.

28:33.874 --> 28:34.855
And then we went to the

28:35.324 --> 28:44.288
Charlie Parker was a senior at Texas and he ran a 19 flat and a 220 with a wind behind his back and I thought it was

28:44.622 --> 28:46.244
He looked to me like he was God.

28:46.724 --> 29:00.858
I mean, he was so smooth, and when I found that, when I saw that Texas, when he came across the finish line, I saw that Texas, and Dean Smith and I was sitting there, and we both right there said, we better go to Texas.

29:00.978 --> 29:05.203
When Charlie Parker ran across the finish line, he said, we better go to Texas.

29:05.403 --> 29:06.744
We shook hands right there.

29:07.525 --> 29:12.150
It wasn't because I didn't know anything about Texas, and I didn't know anything about A&M.

29:12.310 --> 29:14.612
I never, you know.

29:14.592 --> 29:17.235
We were down a little rate up.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.879
But Dean, we were the two best sprinters.

29:20.059 --> 29:24.105
We knew if we got together, we could win a lot of relay races, you know.

29:24.245 --> 29:26.668
So that's the main reason we decided to go to Texas.

29:26.988 --> 29:29.251
But anyway, when I came to A&M, I met Colonel Andy.

29:30.253 --> 29:31.514
Boy, Colonel Andy was great.

29:31.895 --> 29:41.207
And the first thing I did when I recruited, well, he had some good shot putters in my senior year.

29:41.592 --> 29:44.476
He had shot putters and discus throwers that was winning.

29:44.976 --> 29:48.781
So I got real familiar with how to coach, you know.

29:49.442 --> 29:54.869
And then as soon as when I started recruiting Randy Mattson, I mean, that was my selling point.

29:55.209 --> 29:59.695
I got Colonel Frank Anderson there to help you, and I had Danny Roberts, you know.

29:59.895 --> 30:04.581
But anyway, I'd get Colonel Andy to come out and help me coach discus.

30:04.901 --> 30:10.468
And I'd come out there and stand for an hour and watch him coach the discus and the shot put.

30:10.988 --> 30:13.591
What were his coaching techniques?

30:13.691 --> 30:18.376
The main thing is everything just had to be perfect.

30:18.396 --> 30:29.367
Your shoulders had to be square, you know, and when you threw, you had to have your arm at a certain distance and certain heights and so forth.

30:30.048 --> 30:31.990
I learned a lot from Colonel Andy.

30:32.050 --> 30:37.536
I made a pledge to myself when I first got this job that I was going to try to keep up

30:38.123 --> 30:42.662
So I used, now I think that's kind of like a stepping stone.

30:42.683 --> 30:46.037
So I used, see Daryl Hooper was a senior.

30:46.057 --> 30:48.387
All right, Daryl Hooper came to Faustory.

30:49.312 --> 30:58.664
and Darryl Hooper and his wife came to foster and recruited me to come to A&M, Colonel Andy, and sent him down there.

30:58.804 --> 31:01.467
That didn't dawn on me very much.

31:01.588 --> 31:16.787
If A&M had a good sprinter and sent him down there, that would have made a lot of difference, but A&M, Southwest Conference, Olympic champion or whatever he was to recruit me, that didn't make me want to go to A&M, in other words.

31:17.273 --> 31:20.204
because I wasn't going to be throwing a shot to it.

31:20.325 --> 31:23.317
Anyway, Colonel Andy was a great coach.

31:23.337 --> 31:24.762
Was he soft-spoken?

31:24.883 --> 31:25.967
Yes, real kind.
