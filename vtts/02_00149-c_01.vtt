WEBVTT

00:04.503 --> 00:18.585
He called Jane and me to come to the meeting, and he 
went through all the awards they had to give, and

00:04.503 --> 00:18.585
finally he said, well, I have an apple for the 
teacher. And he called my name, and then he called

00:19.827 --> 00:27.539
the name of his high school teacher and sent him an 
apple. And the high school teacher was at the table

00:29.362 --> 00:32.687
I was in, And after he got back with his apple, he 
said, well, do you dread being 72 years old? And I

00:44.701 --> 00:48.687
said, well, no, not that. And I'm not sure I'm 
telling it just exactly right. But he looked at me

00:53.233 --> 00:59.182
and said, well, do you dread being 72 years old? And 
I said, oh, no, I'm already past that. I'm so and so.

01:04.898 --> 01:17.494
And I

01:04.898 --> 01:17.494
just enjoyed the fact that I was older than his high 
school teacher was. Did you organize the Campus

01:17.514 --> 01:22.421
Young Republicans, or was it already going?

01:25.645 --> 01:27.207
It wasn't going very strong. I do not have any 
knowledge of it before I started working with

01:32.219 --> 01:33.761
them. Describe your work with those, please. 
About when was it and how did you get them going? I

01:39.369 --> 01:52.806
have no idea exactly when it was, but somebody came 
to me and asked me to be an advisor for them. I don't

01:52.927 --> 01:55.510
really know who it was or when. But I agreed to be an 
advisor because every organization had to have an

01:56.485 --> 02:02.955
advisor. And if there had been anybody before me, I 
don't know that. But I don't take credit for having

02:07.842 --> 02:14.412
done it if I, you know, I just don't know. And I don't 
really know what year it was. Among those bright

02:17.457 --> 02:23.927
young Republicans, do you remember some names 
with Not really. Was Fred McClure active in the

02:27.274 --> 02:29.837
Young Republican? Not that I remember. And Rick 
Perry?

02:36.343 --> 02:41.668
The fact of the matter is, Rick Perry was a Democrat 
until he ran for Texas Agriculture Commission.

02:41.688 --> 02:43.149
Oh, that's right, that's right. See, he was a 
member of the legislature as a Democrat. He made a

02:46.152 --> 02:50.296
nice record for himself.

02:51.377 --> 02:54.100
Did the Young Republicans meet often? No, they 
didn't have any scheduled meeting. Most of the

02:59.704 --> 03:09.837
young Republicans would get together when 
somebody came to the campus that they thought they

02:59.704 --> 03:09.837
wanted to hear.

03:12.961 --> 03:17.927
Ford was vice president when he came to the campus 
at A&M. I don't remember Reagan coming, but I think

03:18.734 --> 03:22.119
he did. I don't know whether he did or not. I 
remember when Vice President Ford came to speak at

03:25.343 --> 03:32.673
commencement. Did you and the group greet him or 
anything? I think so. I really do that. That was

03:38.962 --> 03:41.546
just about all the contact we had.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.733
When... When Reagan was running for the 
nomination,

03:47.742 --> 04:13.679
I went to the National Republican chairman and 
told him, and his name was Long, L-O-N-G, told him

03:47.742 --> 04:13.679
that Reagan could not carry Texas if Bush wasn't on 
the ticket. And I also had contact with another

04:16.902 --> 04:20.528
supporter of Reagan in Houston that I went to see. 
And as I say, just like a lot of the other things, I

04:21.530 --> 04:27.460
don't know whether I had anything to do with the 
dog. But you didn't hurt. But when you drive from

04:29.162 --> 04:40.902
Lubbock over to Midland and talk to a man and say, 
look here, this is what you need to do, it ought to

04:29.162 --> 04:40.902
have some effect. But I did not believe Reagan 
could get the nomination without Bush. Let me add a

04:46.968 --> 04:49.851
note in here for the typist. Typist, this is an 
editor's note that I want you to add right after the

04:49.912 --> 04:58.641
mention of Vice President Ford. He was scheduled 
to speak in 1974, I believe it was. Watergate was at

05:03.967 --> 05:16.824
its height, and we were hoping to have him speak at 
A&M at about the time he was going to become

05:03.967 --> 05:16.824
president because Nixon, we knew, wasn't going to 
be there very long. I was the chairman of all the

05:17.645 --> 05:26.397
commencement arrangements reported to me as dean 
of faculties. We were in the letterman's lounge of

05:26.377 --> 05:34.891
G. Raleigh White Coliseum, putting on our caps and 
gowns, getting ready to go into commencement. And

05:36.253 --> 05:51.979
all of us, because of the security arrangements to 
ensure the safety of the vice president, we all had

05:36.253 --> 05:51.979
special little lapel tags, and no one without one 
of those tags was allowed into the rooms. Very soon

05:53.596 --> 05:58.064
after we all got there, here came a man named M.T. 
Harrington, former professor of chemistry and

05:58.124 --> 06:05.036
dean and president and chancellor. And he and Vice 
President Ford had been on many national

06:06.259 --> 06:15.435
committees together, had worked together, were 
truly old friends. He didn't have one of those

06:15.854 --> 06:17.556
tags. And the university person checking the door 
to see that no one was allowed into the letterman's

06:18.638 --> 06:31.335
lounge that shouldn't be in there knew Dr. 
Harrington very well. And so he didn't turn this

06:32.136 --> 06:36.763
retired man away because he didn't have a lapel 
tag. And so here came Dr. Harrington striding into

06:37.604 --> 06:45.034
the room very rapidly, heading toward Gerald Ford 
and with his one hand in his pocket and the other

06:45.368 --> 06:53.456
hand reaching out around Vice President Ford's 
shoulder. The CIA, or I guess it would be the Secret

06:54.497 --> 07:03.527
Service men, did not recognize this man, of 
course. They saw that he didn't have a lapel pin as

07:04.107 --> 07:08.171
he should have. They grabbed him and shoved him up 
against the wall and began to search him. while the

07:14.073 --> 07:18.540
rest of us both frowned and chuckled at the same 
time. Ford recognized him quickly and called him

07:19.522 --> 07:28.436
by his nickname, and the two of them shook hands, 
and quickly the Secret Service backed off. So much

07:29.638 --> 07:34.225
for an introduction to Aggie welcomes. Back

07:34.205 --> 07:48.826
now to chatting with you, what was the benefit, you 
think, in the long run for these young people to be

07:34.205 --> 07:48.826
part of the young Republicans while they were 
undergraduates? Well, the only benefit that I

07:49.788 --> 08:03.908
could see was the fact that we had been the minority 
party so long and I had suffered so much

07:49.788 --> 08:03.908
discrimination without giving up that I thought 
they could be indoctrinated to where we'd have

08:04.276 --> 08:11.807
some Republican leaders from that group of 
people. And I think we have. Did you have some key

08:16.494 --> 08:21.482
faculty and staff allies in those days? I don't 
remember but one person that one year Mrs. Black

08:30.601 --> 08:40.901
and I have no idea who she was, came and sort of 
contested my being an advisor. And since I had been

08:40.941 --> 08:48.456
so long an advisor, she was co-advisor with me for 
one year. I don't know the woman. I don't know

08:49.999 --> 08:51.782
anything about her at all. but she also was 
recognized as a sponsor for a year. Now let's see,

08:58.539 --> 09:01.224
you were on the faculty about 20 years? 22. 22. Who 
were the key department leaders during those days

09:01.965 --> 09:12.927
in your department, the key faculty and 
department heads? Well,

09:13.379 --> 09:27.100
since I was in the animal science building, the 
head of the animal science department was one of

09:13.379 --> 09:27.100
the key members of the agricultural faculty. I 
knew people in ag education. You meant O.D.

09:33.170 --> 09:33.430
Butler. O.D. Butler. Describe O.D. as a 
department head, his leadership techniques. I

09:39.778 --> 09:46.347
didn't have any contact with him except saying 
hello to him as he went in and out of the building. I

09:46.367 --> 09:50.613
was in the genetics department with Godby until he 
retired. Who succeeded him? Well, they took the

09:52.075 --> 09:58.523
genetics department and divided it into several 
different sections. And I was put in the plant

09:59.161 --> 10:06.611
science, and somebody else was put in animal 
science, and somebody else was put over here. Who

10:06.772 --> 10:08.694
headed plant science? Rossberg. Describe him as a 
department leader. I thought Rossberg was one of

10:14.903 --> 10:19.910
the poorest leaders that A&M had. This is David 
R-O-S-S-B-E-R-G. That's right. Who succeeded

10:24.937 --> 10:25.818
him? Uh... Johan. Howard Johan. J-O-H-A-N. 
Right. What about him? He was a prince. What made

10:39.128 --> 10:42.133
him so capable? Well, we had a young professor that 
came into the department after I'd been there for a

10:42.153 --> 10:49.625
couple of years. And his father was a geneticist at 
Iowa State. And He really felt like that being a

10:57.380 --> 11:05.009
young man, he just knew more than any old man around 
there. And so when I had something that I wanted to

11:06.230 --> 11:17.063
discuss with the department head, I'd have to go, 
I'd talk to him. And by the time I got to Rossberg's

11:18.184 --> 11:22.189
office, Jim Smith had been there, and instead of 
listening to me, Rossberg would start telling me

11:22.912 --> 11:32.929
what my problem was and how to solve it. And he had 
Smith's version only, and that was why I had not

11:32.949 --> 11:41.663
very much use for him. And I'm really baring my soul 
for you young man. What about after Rossburg? I

11:48.822 --> 11:50.125
mean, after Johan? Well, another man took the job 
after Johan retired. But I retired the same year

11:54.956 --> 11:57.823
Johan retired. Okay. All right. The dean of 
agriculture, when you came...

12:06.128 --> 12:09.354
I guess was Kunkel, I'm not sure. No, Patterson or 
Watkins? Not the dean of agriculture. And then

12:16.587 --> 12:17.348
Kunkel. Well, I don't know that. Okay. In 57, I 
don't think that I had either of these other two

12:20.694 --> 12:28.188
people, but I'm not going to. All right. When the 
board voted to approve coeducation and make the

12:31.508 --> 12:43.615
core optional, what did you and your colleagues 
think? Most of us were glad. We thought it should

12:45.078 --> 12:50.209
have been done earlier. What result did you think 
it would bring to A&M? I just thought it would bring

12:54.353 --> 13:08.408
growth to the college and some sort of mixing of the 
sexes that had prevented A&M from growing so many

12:54.353 --> 13:08.408
years. One of the things that I can add to it, that I 
had a daughter that graduated And she couldn't go

13:17.240 --> 13:22.567
to A&M and she got her degree from TWU. And I had 
another daughter that couldn't go to A&M who had to

13:23.308 --> 13:30.738
go to Abilene Christian College. And after they 
opened A&M to girls, she was taking courses in the

13:30.758 --> 13:43.635
summertime at A&M and going to to Abilene in the 
long term. And so she went back to Abilene because

13:47.086 --> 13:53.135
she was a leader in Abilene. And she said, Daddy, 
they elected me president of the Eta Beta Club. And

14:00.406 --> 14:02.709
I want to go back since I was elected. I want to go 
back. So she went to Abilene two years and went to

14:04.231 --> 14:12.003
A&M one year and got her degree from A&M. And I doubt 
if there was a A female got a degree from A&M before

14:14.395 --> 14:25.924
Ruth did, except maybe a veterinarian student who 
was female and admitted before it was open to all

14:14.395 --> 14:25.924
females. Did she ever share any stories about how 
she was treated as a pioneer co-ed at A&M? Not

14:34.187 --> 14:35.088
particularly. So you didn't hear of any problems? 
She didn't have any problems.

14:41.956 --> 14:45.601
I took a course with her one time. I generally took a 
course every two or three years. I decided that it

14:52.280 --> 14:58.848
made you humble if you got in a class. I took a 
Spanish class one time that I didn't do well in, and

15:00.310 --> 15:08.701
I was ashamed of myself. I took a psychology class 
at the same time Ruth took it. And Ruth would answer

15:15.409 --> 15:20.295
the roll, The teacher would call my name first, Mr. 
McNeil, and then he'd say, Mrs. McNeil, and Ruth

15:20.714 --> 15:32.405
would snort and say, Miss McNeil. And... after the 
course was over with, he said, I didn't know if she

15:35.328 --> 15:53.052
wasn't your wife until after she took me quiz and 
said she beat you a few points and she was so

15:35.328 --> 15:53.052
jubilant about it that I realized that it wasn't a 
wife having fun with her husband. I don't know what

15:54.073 --> 16:00.061
kind of an old goat he thought I was, but anyway, I 
took a psychology course one time. Do you remember

16:00.862 --> 16:04.407
some of the first coeds you had in class?

16:09.533 --> 16:21.965
Well,

16:09.533 --> 16:21.965
one of them was Dr. Deeker's wife, Dr. Deeker's, 
Paul Deeker's mother. D-I-E-K-E-R-T. Right. And

16:26.970 --> 16:30.614
she was a good student. She made an A, and her son 
made a B, but he was having to, do all of the things

16:37.985 --> 16:42.050
that he was interested in. And he had a lab class and 
he missed a class or two in genetics with outside

16:43.051 --> 16:52.061
activity.

16:52.081 --> 16:59.910
Did some faculty members have to change some of 
their stories and examples when ladies were in the

16:52.081 --> 16:59.910
class? That's right. Do you remember in your 
classes, do you remember any pranks that the male

17:02.386 --> 17:10.983
students tried to play on the coeds? I don't 
remember anything. I never saw anything. What

17:16.375 --> 17:18.418
about racial integration? Do you remember any 
difficulties any black student ever

17:18.438 --> 17:21.744
encountered? No, I don't. But there weren't many 
blacks coming. When the people that I knew in

17:28.374 --> 17:42.737
Pakistan came to America on grants,

17:28.374 --> 17:42.737
when they came to America at their orientation in 
Washington, They'd say, well, what do you want to

17:43.493 --> 17:45.235
do? And at least seven or eight people that I knew 
over there said, well, we want to go to College

17:46.517 --> 17:54.848
Station. We've got a friend in College Station. 
And when they came here and walked on the campus of

17:58.633 --> 18:09.568
A&M, one of the first things they noticed was that 
there was no blacks. And they said to me, where are

18:10.207 --> 18:14.091
the blacks going to school? And I said, well, they 
go to school at Prairie View. It's part of A&M. And

18:19.116 --> 18:20.978
they said, we want to see Prairie View. And I don't 
know how many trips I made to Prairie View, taking

18:22.099 --> 18:29.407
people from Pakistan down to Prairie View. And I 
would go to the president of Prairie View and tell

18:30.408 --> 18:38.256
him that we were on the campus. And Prairie View had 
a rule that no

18:39.468 --> 18:52.840
black people and white people could eat in the 
dining hall. And he had asked me to go with the

18:53.841 --> 19:00.326
Pakistanis to have our lunch. And one time I said, 
Doctor,

19:01.688 --> 19:07.753
can't get the name now, Evans. said, Dr. Evans, 
I'll go into town. These people want to eat with

19:11.157 --> 19:12.799
you. And he said, I can't do that. He said, if I went 
in there with these people that are considered

19:15.121 --> 19:23.349
same as white people, he said, I'd be in trouble. 
And I don't know how many people I took to Prairie

19:24.110 --> 19:29.235
View that I ate in his place. I was the host in his 
place. Did the Pakistanis ever mention to you any

19:32.618 --> 19:38.584
difficulty they had at A&M? Not really. I took Kazi 
to the grocery store every time he went to the

19:42.353 --> 19:49.231
store.

19:49.251 --> 19:50.093
I went to the grocery store one morning, and one of 
my students was the meat cutter. And he finished my

19:56.714 --> 20:01.820
order, and a woman came up because he was with me. 
And so I finished mine. And this woman stepped up,

20:08.609 --> 20:13.034
and he said, is there anything else, Dr. McNeil? 
And I said, no, but this man is my friend, and he's

20:13.074 --> 20:20.063
going to get his order finished before you can. I 
don't have any idea who the woman was, but it was a

20:20.397 --> 20:24.722
white woman, I guarantee you. And there was, that 
answers your question if I understand it.

20:39.400 --> 20:43.305
Mr. Rutter made these, he led these key changes at 
A&M. How did you and your faculty associates come

20:44.046 --> 20:50.033
to feel about him and his leadership?

20:53.455 --> 20:57.760
Well, he was much more respected when he left than 
he was when he came. What about Jack Williams, who

20:59.322 --> 21:01.785
followed him? Jack Williams was a completely 
different person, and he was good for A&M. He's my

21:10.015 --> 21:10.816
favorite. He was good for A&M. I finally... said, 
look here, here I am teaching all of these students

21:16.287 --> 21:24.556
and I'm going to find out why I haven't gotten a 
raise. And I went to the department head and he

21:26.338 --> 21:31.304
said, oh, you know, Jim Smith had been there. And 
then I went to Kunkel

21:32.505 --> 21:41.855
and he said, well, you haven't done any research 
work. I said, you know, research work is

21:43.177 --> 21:46.260
important. And I said, well, I've been teaching 
students and so on and so on. And he said, well, I

21:51.717 --> 21:57.506
said, if I don't get help from you, I'm going to 
Williams. And Williams was really annoyed with me

21:58.267 --> 22:05.499
for not stopping because Kunkel told me to stop. 
But I told him what I thought, and I didn't lose

22:06.761 --> 22:13.952
respect for him at all. But I did feel like that he 
had problems. That's all there is to it. And then

22:21.347 --> 22:26.994
Dr. Williams has the heart attack, and he is 
replaced then. He becomes chancellor, and Jarvis

22:27.114 --> 22:31.000
Miller became president. Did you all have any 
perception of Jarvis as president? Not any, as far

22:34.925 --> 22:36.747
as I'm concerned. All right, we're getting near 
the end then. As you look back over these years...

22:43.328 --> 22:52.641
What were the positive, important decisions that 
A&M leadership made during your years? Well, the

22:53.122 --> 23:04.037
abolishing core requirement was number one as far 
as I was concerned. And the admission of women may

23:04.899 --> 23:11.207
have been greater than abolishing the 
requirement for core. I don't know that. but those

23:12.860 --> 23:14.606
two things. And to one extent or another, the only 
problem that I was able to find was the fact that the

23:22.141 --> 23:29.291
salaries were not really equal. If you come to the 
office and waved a telegram in somebody's face,

23:30.333 --> 23:43.491
you got a raise, and if you didn't come to the office 
with a telegram in your hand, they didn't give you a

23:30.333 --> 23:43.491
raise. Are there any omission? Well, first of all, 
mistakes. Can you think of any key decisions that

23:49.166 --> 23:57.116
were now we can say were mistakes?

24:00.721 --> 24:04.786
I think it was a mistake to fire Gene Stallings as 
football coach. Okay, okay. I really do. I was in

24:08.125 --> 24:17.365
Dallas when A&M beat Alabama and Bryant carried 
Gene off the field. Other mistakes that you can...

24:18.828 --> 24:25.543
Any omissions where we had a chance and we just 
passed it by?

24:30.907 --> 24:36.134
I'm asking things that I really don't have any way 
of judgment. And I don't have any to suggest. All

24:37.976 --> 24:48.970
right,

24:37.976 --> 24:48.970
who were some people highly deserving of credit 
that we may have kind of overlooked? Like you

24:49.031 --> 24:52.135
mentioned Howard Gravitt. Wasn't Howard Gravitt 
a very capable pre-med advisor? No question. I did

24:57.962 --> 24:59.484
not question that at all. No, I know you didn't. But 
in the meantime, when I first started teaching, he

25:00.657 --> 25:10.516
sent me cards to evaluate the pre-med students. 
And it got to be that I had a class of 250 and then

25:10.536 --> 25:18.432
another 250 in spring term. And there was no way for 
me to evaluate. Fifteen men out of 250, and I just

25:22.460 --> 25:30.170
sent them back to him and said, I can't do it 
anymore. I'm not fair. Couldn't make it. What

25:33.454 --> 25:37.059
about Dean Potts? I thought Dean Potts did a great 
job. I never had any problem as far as I was

25:39.582 --> 25:42.966
concerned. with Posh. I thought Posh was a fair, 
level-headed, conscientious man. Wayne Stark? I

25:57.484 --> 26:00.688
didn't have that much contact with Wayne Stark. 
Gordon Gay? I thought Gordon Gay did a fantastic

26:02.390 --> 26:05.153
job. And the thing that bothers me is the fact that 
the man who took his place was a CBI man. And he was

26:15.245 --> 26:21.851
there for seventeen years that I didn't know that 
he had been in CBI. Now what was his name?

26:28.437 --> 26:29.398
Replace Gordon Gay? Yeah, Replace Gordon Gay.

26:34.223 --> 26:43.952
He was called a fighting preacher whenever he was 
in CBI.

26:45.333 --> 26:58.653
And I didn't know him well enough to...

26:45.333 --> 26:58.653
All right, if you now could be an advisor to Texas 
A&M's leadership, what advice would you give

26:45.333 --> 26:58.653
them?

27:06.244 --> 27:09.248
Well, the only thing that I would advise... is that 
they should give more emphasis to the teaching of

27:09.852 --> 27:25.321
young men than to the praise and glory they give to 
their research people. And you said men. You meant

27:27.064 --> 27:28.166
men and women. Well, yes, I did. So give more credit 
for teaching than they now give instead of giving

27:31.435 --> 27:38.124
so much to research. That's right. Any other 
advice you would give them?

27:44.633 --> 27:46.275
Well, not really.

27:51.982 --> 27:52.683
Let's see. What have we left out? I'm about done. To 
the end of the ideas I thought. Well, you've asked

27:59.997 --> 28:03.702
an awful lot of things that are in my memoir. All 
right. Let's see. If you ever have any memorabilia

28:09.349 --> 28:25.911
about your A&M experiences that you are going to 
dispose of, I beg that you please contact the A&M

28:09.349 --> 28:25.911
archives because they will preserve them and 
would be They will then be a treasure house for

28:26.414 --> 28:28.738
everybody to use. Please don't throw them away.

28:33.525 --> 28:45.925
Let's make believe that somebody walks up to you 
and gives you a million-dollar check, but the one

28:33.525 --> 28:45.925
requirement of that check is that you must pass it 
on to Texas A&M. If you could make a substantial

28:47.474 --> 28:54.807
gift to Texas A&M, what would you want them to do 
with that gift? What purpose would you most want

28:54.827 --> 28:58.172
them to accomplish? Since I was in academics, I 
want to strengthen the academics rather than the

28:58.453 --> 29:04.303
research. All right. Where? How? Well, give 
better teachers to the freshmen that come into A&M

29:05.986 --> 29:19.265
instead of giving them graduate students to teach 
classes and do whatever they do. In any particular

29:19.605 --> 29:21.708
discipline? Not any. I have no criticism of any 
department at A&M. Among your many, many memories

29:29.479 --> 29:34.827
of A&M, which ones do you cherish most? What were 
the your happiest A&M moments, proudest? I guess

29:40.245 --> 29:47.895
I'd have to say that it was when I got, was 
recognized as an outstanding professor in 1965.

29:49.678 --> 30:05.220
And the next one was when I was named as one of the 
outstanding professors in the School of Arts of

30:07.664 --> 30:21.960
Let me see how that word, the one that Dean,

30:07.664 --> 30:21.960
hmm, that word left me too. Sciences and 
agriculture and sciences or biology and sciences

30:23.341 --> 30:29.086
or something like that. They started that program 
in 74. And four people were recognized. And the

30:35.512 --> 30:41.557
head of the animal science department, Butler, 
was one of them. And I do not know all of the others.

30:45.581 --> 30:47.743
John Hutchinson was recognized. John and I slept 
in the same room the first year I went to A&M. He was

30:53.328 --> 31:11.708
working on a poultry farm when I was working on the 
poultry farm And I don't know the other two, but I'm

30:53.328 --> 31:11.708
I think they were politicians to tell you the truth 
and then the next four was McNeil and the publisher

30:53.328 --> 31:11.708
of the Southern agriculture. I don't remember 
exactly the name of the magazine, but his name was

31:15.444 --> 31:22.601
Scruggs. And I saw Scruggs and McGregor not too 
long ago, and I said, well,
