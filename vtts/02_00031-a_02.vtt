WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:08.519
No more calls because they had, the water was 
winding down at that period of time. Okay. And then

00:10.160 --> 00:30.763
I graduated and the elder had called me and said 
there was a veteran that died at Brennan and he

00:10.160 --> 00:30.763
might want to come over and look and I did and so I 
bought his practice you might say. All right, now

00:30.878 --> 00:32.941
how did you meet this young lady? Well, do I have to 
admit that?

00:40.414 --> 00:41.275
You want me to tell us? Well, it doesn't make any 
difference. I met him when we were double dating.

00:48.367 --> 00:51.132
Go ahead. Anyhow, yeah, we had to update it, and 
then I asked her for a date, and they went from

00:52.732 --> 00:57.758
there. Okay, and had you gotten married before you 
graduated? No. Oh, okay. It was almost a year

01:04.485 --> 01:09.290
before we went over there and then we got married. 
So you go to Brenham and open up a veterinary

01:09.991 --> 01:14.616
practice in? In Brenham, Texas. In what year? 
1945, February. February 45. And it was a general

01:23.220 --> 01:26.064
practice? General practice, yeah. There's 
nothing like it was then. Those were, in that time

01:30.810 --> 01:47.832
there was, during the war there were very few 
tractors made, and a lot of things weren't there,

01:30.810 --> 01:47.832
but horse and mules were still holding on, and a lot 
of it was horse and mule, and a few small animals.

01:48.773 --> 01:54.221
And it was a challenge, but I guess because of the 
variety it was easier. Can you give some examples

01:56.325 --> 02:02.775
of what the veterinarian's fee was at that time? 
What did you charge? Well,

02:05.759 --> 02:11.929
trying to figure that out, I was accused of being 
too cheap. It was a dollar a mile plus five dollars

02:12.790 --> 02:17.397
to deliver a calf. would vaccinate a dog for two and 
a half. And basically that was it. I remember I did

02:27.189 --> 02:39.080
an interception for, I rejected the gut of a cow 
that had an interception and that was $25. And that

02:39.220 --> 02:46.827
was foolish on my part, but not having a mentor, and 
you may recognize that I'm very strong on the

02:47.465 --> 02:58.900
influence of mentors, and I did not have one, and 
going out and working on those things. Fees were

02:59.521 --> 03:03.586
very inexpensive, $5. How many other 
veterinarians were there then in Washington

03:03.606 --> 03:06.851
County? There was one other at that time. He was a 
non-graduate, a graduate of Fort Worth

03:09.774 --> 03:16.223
Veterinary School. and about 1900. And later 
there, others came, and I think there's 10 or 12

03:20.887 --> 03:29.416
over there now in the same unit. How long did you 
practice over there before you joined, came back

03:29.436 --> 03:33.841
and joined the faculty? I was over there about four 
and a half years. Okay. And I had an opportunity to,

03:37.585 --> 03:43.932
I decided, I really wasn't, it wasn't what I wanted 
because I like to do something, I want to do it

03:45.059 --> 03:47.242
reasonably well. And so I left there and went to, 
took a job at LSU in the Experiment Station and with

03:48.584 --> 03:59.778
the Veterinary Science Department. And there I 
taught, did research in poultry diseases and

03:59.798 --> 04:07.769
other animal diseases.

04:07.789 --> 04:14.678
And then the opportunity came to the Air Force was, 
put a pretty good pressure on upon us and so I

04:15.670 --> 04:21.077
volunteered and was commissioned captain. This 
would be during the Korean War period? During the

04:24.001 --> 04:26.123
Korean War period in 1951. And where did you, where 
were you sent? I went to Edwards Air Force Base, the

04:28.867 --> 04:35.616
Air Force flight center, Chuck Yeager's whole 
place. And he was there doing, flying the X-4 at

04:35.636 --> 04:42.184
that time.

04:43.345 --> 04:44.606
We lived on the base. What were your professional 
duties? Well, we were, at that time, they had a chip

04:47.569 --> 04:53.615
colony there and I had little exposure to that. And 
they were using those to study wind blasts. And

04:58.821 --> 05:11.013
Colonel Stapp had a program where he had these 
sleds lined up on the tracks and they would use

04:58.821 --> 05:11.013
rocket power. At that time they were developing 
rockets. rocket-powered planes and

05:13.805 --> 05:24.418
rocket-powered this, and they used that to propel 
these sleds with these chimps at high speeds down

05:13.805 --> 05:24.418
these tracks. And then the main assignment there 
was food service inspections and sanitation,

05:26.160 --> 05:42.580
sanitary.

05:44.146 --> 05:46.168
I guess like public health officers do. And then 
we, for the quartermaster market center in Los

05:47.169 --> 05:59.823
Angeles, would buy meat and mainly eggs and 
poultry. At one time I had five master sergeants in

05:59.904 --> 06:08.293
my outfit and two others. And I really didn't have a 
lot of work to do. Did you find that a pleasant

06:10.435 --> 06:12.938
assignment? And you were there how long? We were 
there two years, and we signed up for three. And

06:19.372 --> 06:26.759
like everything else, that was winding down, and 
they came out and said, you can go if you like. And I

06:28.141 --> 06:30.903
said, I like. But it was very nice. We lived out 
there in the hospital compound with a lot of good

06:32.305 --> 06:43.836
people in the same boat we were in, and physicians 
that had been through the same kind of a situation.

06:47.350 --> 06:48.291
Where after that? Well, I had committed when I was 
at LSU to go to the LSU Medical School to study

06:50.394 --> 07:13.384
virology, and because of this other thing 
intervened, I came back, I said, well, I still am

06:50.394 --> 07:13.384
interested in microbiology, and so we came back, I 
went over to Texas University, and I went, they

06:50.394 --> 07:13.384
sent me over and said, well, I went to see Dr. 
Williams who then was head of the Department of

07:13.820 --> 07:22.732
Microbiology and also the head of their athletic 
committee. But anyhow, he said, he said, go over to

07:23.834 --> 07:26.998
graduate school. I went over there and I walked in 
and there was a little gal sitting at the table

07:27.018 --> 07:35.289
there and I told her what I wanted to do and she said, 
have you got two years of foreign languages? I

07:35.349 --> 07:36.210
said, no, I got one. She said, well, you can't do 
that. That's what's the matter. All you dentists

07:39.435 --> 07:41.177
and all you other people, you you think you can get 
away with this, and I went and got out of there and I

07:41.596 --> 07:46.364
came over here. Well, the only program they 
offered here was a Ph.D. in the medical area was in

07:47.385 --> 08:01.227
pathology, and so I talked to Hilton Smith, and he 
said, well, go over and set it up. Now, what role,

08:02.229 --> 08:04.212
what was his task? He was the head of the 
department. All right. And what's his first name?

08:07.811 --> 08:09.313
Hilton Atwell Smith. Oh, Hilton Smith. Okay. 
Yeah. And so this is 1953? Two? Three. Three. Yeah.

08:17.866 --> 08:20.530
How many other doctoral students were there? One. 
Ph.D. Okay. And I was the second one to get a degree,

08:23.855 --> 08:29.643
a Ph.D. that takes you to finish curriculum. How 
long did it take? It didn't take a heck of a long

08:31.647 --> 08:34.890
time. I started in 53, I got a master's in 54, and I 
got a PSD in January, I guess, of 57. Was the GI Bill

08:47.442 --> 08:49.364
important to you? Some, yeah. I had saved quite a 
bit of money by cashing in my leave time from the

08:53.027 --> 09:01.435
service.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.096
We borrowed a little money. Where did you all live? 
We lived first on College Main. A little house up

09:11.165 --> 09:12.666
there.

09:15.830 --> 09:20.656
It's now apartments there, huh? Yeah. Chemistry 
teacher. The kooky one. Oh, yeah,

09:27.807 --> 09:35.764
sure. Yeah, yeah. That's right.

09:45.172 --> 09:50.758
Who was your chairman of your doctoral? Hilton 
Smith. Hilton Smith. All right. He was quite a, he

09:54.422 --> 10:05.054
wrote probably the very best yet, and the very 
first literary pathology text. At that time, was

10:05.074 --> 10:09.319
he probably the most highly respected member of 
the department? Well, he was the member of the

10:10.020 --> 10:11.922
department. And the others were assistants. Oh, 
okay. And I mean by that,

10:16.486 --> 10:31.320
he was the leader in his, in veterinary pathology. 
About how big was the veterinary faculty then in

10:32.000 --> 10:35.643
numbers? Oh, veterinary faculty? The total. I 
guess there were 30, 40. And four in pathology, did

10:41.146 --> 10:43.509
you say? And still located where it had been. Yes, 
it was down in the old building down there. I

10:52.000 --> 10:56.386
remember that it was, I did a lot of study at night. 
And the reason I did that, that Hilton was a very

10:56.406 --> 11:03.555
capable person. And he told the university that he 
had to have air condition because his paraffin

11:03.675 --> 11:10.444
wasn't, would melt so he got a wind air conditioner 
and that was in

11:11.335 --> 11:22.325
the old hospital. Who was the dean when you were a 
doctoral student?

11:42.217 --> 11:48.046
B-O-U-G-H-T-O-N.

11:42.217 --> 11:48.046
That's a very interesting history. That's pretty 
well out loud. I just pulled out that book there

11:50.369 --> 11:53.754
that Pat Byrne wrote on history. He replaced, at 
that time, Dr. Dunn, who was the head of pathology,

11:55.056 --> 12:09.477
microbiology,

11:55.056 --> 12:09.477
and all that. Belton was a A researcher from, had 
been out in West Texas, done a lot of work and

12:11.208 --> 12:22.918
research and the administration wanted to bring 
somebody in to develop the program. And they

12:22.938 --> 12:30.645
brought him in and he picked, he decided he needed a 
pathologist, so he knew Hilton Smith. And so he

12:32.207 --> 12:34.228
brought him in. And I was fortunate enough just to 
happen in and find, well, this is a program. As you

12:40.672 --> 12:50.245
look back on your doctoral studies, what were the 
most important courses, most important research

12:40.672 --> 12:50.245
that you did?

12:56.873 --> 13:06.426
Well, as a student, I was quite interested in renal 
quality or kidney diseases. I did some work on, it

13:07.030 --> 13:10.915
was Hilton's idea. He said, I can't diagnose 
leptospirosis. I know that's what it is, but I

13:16.122 --> 13:19.247
can't prove it. I want to know why. So my 
dissertation was to find out what parameters

13:22.031 --> 13:35.569
influence the persistence and the capability of 
demonstrating those and then he arranged for me to

13:22.031 --> 13:35.569
go to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in 
Washington. And they were working on that spiral

13:36.258 --> 13:51.258
scenario, so I continued that as a resident there,

13:36.258 --> 13:51.258
and then came back and wrote my dissertation. Now, 
how many other doctoral students were there when

13:51.519 --> 13:54.923
you were working on yours? Just one. Just one? So 
there are two? S-I-P-P-E-L,

13:58.668 --> 14:07.377
so that there was not a group to gather with and be 
friends with or anything like that? Not really.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.603
And Hilton was a rather unique person. He had some 
of my own philosophy, I guess, that he would say,

14:14.144 --> 14:21.471
what about this? And I'd expect him to explain it to 
me. He said, you figure it out. He said, we'll

14:25.455 --> 14:26.616
discuss it. Did you become acquainted with some of 
the faculty members that became an important

14:27.473 --> 14:37.386
friendship later while you were a student?

14:44.395 --> 14:45.436
Well, there weren't many around. Millet, honey. 
Huh? He was a faculty member. Did you make

14:54.736 --> 14:57.319
acquaintance with some of those faculty members? 
Yeah. I studied under John Miller. Describe him as

15:01.684 --> 15:04.767
a teacher. He was a gentleman's gentleman, an 
excellent teacher, very concerned about his

15:05.128 --> 15:12.656
students. And being a gentleman without children 
of his own, I can say he had a certain respect for

15:19.448 --> 15:23.012
them and treated them as such. Did you all have a 
nickname for him? No,

15:25.574 --> 15:31.020
Dr. John. Dr. John. Other faculty members that you 
met as a student that you remember gratefully,

15:33.802 --> 15:45.574
proudly?

15:53.705 --> 15:57.811
Of course, I appreciate Hilton Smith. Hilton was a 
very intelligent person, but he was standoffish.

16:02.938 --> 16:11.952
But I still respect a person, a professional that 
named himself in a professional way. And of

16:12.272 --> 16:16.098
course, there was Dr. A. Square Leonard. A. 
Square? Yeah, A. A. Leonard. That's what the

16:21.506 --> 16:22.467
students called him, A. Square. And he was head of 
the clinics and what have you.

16:33.108 --> 16:35.951
And some of them, we had a lot of others, R.D. Turk.

16:39.194 --> 16:40.215
Did he have a nickname? Not really that I know of. 
Everybody called him, his colleagues called him

16:44.900 --> 16:49.244
Dick. But they told a lot of stories about Dr. Turk. 
He was hard of hearing and wore a hearing aid. You

16:56.300 --> 16:57.763
heard this probably.

17:01.490 --> 17:18.100
He would be lecturing and back there and somebody 
would say something derogatory in the back room

17:01.490 --> 17:18.100
and he'd just say, you know, I can't hear you but I 
can read your lips.

17:18.248 --> 17:26.938
He, on the day in 64 when I got this teaching award, 
he got the next one. And I was up on the stage and when

17:26.958 --> 17:34.307
he walked by the microphone, he said loudly to Mr. 
Rudder, Earl, y'all must have been pretty damn

17:34.367 --> 17:39.333
hard up to give me one of these. And Mr. Rudder was 
kind of like. That's the way he is. He was. Was he

17:46.227 --> 17:48.870
always congenial with everybody? Oh, yeah. And he 
talked. He was a very intelligent person. And if

17:53.995 --> 18:03.804
you live long enough, you'll know that certain 
things push certain people into certain

17:53.995 --> 18:03.804
endeavors. And I think his hearing pushed him into 
academia. Okay. And he was a Kansas State

18:08.629 --> 18:11.311
graduate. Very intelligent. But he was always he 
could talk a lot, and one time he was talking to me,

18:16.417 --> 18:22.925
and I responded, I didn't know what to say. He said, 
you've just been bamboozled. Now, as a young

18:26.769 --> 18:34.698
couple, what community activities did you all get 
involved in while you were a graduate student?

18:37.061 --> 18:39.184
Studying in church. Which church? Lutheran. 
Lutheran. And it then was located where? Right

18:47.910 --> 18:49.452
where it was. Right now, except where the main 
church was, where the fellowship hall is where the

18:49.533 --> 19:03.640
church was, it was an old house that they had 
converted and made into it, and then later on the

18:49.533 --> 19:03.640
new church was built. They actually took over. 
Well, it was a mission church for students. Now,

19:08.146 --> 19:12.753
Missouri Synod or American Lutheran? About how 
big was the congregation in those days? A hundred?

19:18.842 --> 19:19.664
Less. I think less than that. I really do. But you 
had a full-time minister.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.596
Well, they always did. We weren't here when it was 
first organized. But Swaggart was there, wasn't

19:30.140 --> 19:33.385
it? Yeah. And yeah, he was full-time. And where did 
a young graduate student and his family go if they

19:37.436 --> 19:49.390
were going to have any kind of enjoyment on a 
Saturday night? Brown. Huh, where? Brown. Oh, to

19:54.256 --> 19:56.799
go to family, okay. Either that or we didn't do a 
whole lot past school You know, he was so involved,

20:01.514 --> 20:07.102
he was so tied up with his research that we didn't. 
And I had the children a whole lot. Of course, I

20:08.904 --> 20:10.747
participated in a few. I think the graduate 
student wives had just a few little

20:10.787 --> 20:16.095
get-togethers. And you didn't have a huge amount 
of money. Yeah. Because I wasn't working. I was

20:23.445 --> 20:24.607
home with two children. All right, as you are 
getting near the end of this doctoral program,

20:30.708 --> 20:33.532
What did you think you were going to do 
professionally? Well, I was going into research,

20:35.034 --> 20:47.613
education and research, and I had an appointment 
to, well, I was at that time, I guess what I, I was

20:35.034 --> 20:47.613
dickering with Oklahoma State, the department 
head there. And they, I was in Washington, D.C.,

20:48.754 --> 20:58.048
and Hilton at that time was on the advisory board 
for me. at the institute. And he had had a

21:02.285 --> 21:13.234
resignation, and so he called me and asked me if I 
was interested. And he told me what salary I

21:13.254 --> 21:16.197
wanted. I said, well, the salaries are not that 
intriguing, but the opportunities are. Now, to

21:22.062 --> 21:23.583
join the faculty here? Yeah. And this is 1953?

21:29.669 --> 21:31.612
Do you remember what the salary? About $4,500. 
$4,500. And

21:34.155 --> 21:40.283
so you decided to accept? Oh, yes. In fact, we had 
signed the one for Oklahoma State. We were ready to

21:45.870 --> 21:52.138
mail it in when he called him and offered that to 
him. I had an opportunity. I'd dickered with the

21:53.300 --> 21:58.967
Air Force office in Washington. about going back 
into the Air Force service. And they told me, they

22:04.671 --> 22:12.182
said, you can go to Alaska if you like for your 
foreign duty, which you'd have to do now. And so we

22:13.644 --> 22:21.034
talked against that, I guess, and fought against 
it. Describe the department in terms of its

22:21.054 --> 22:25.680
people. and its facilities when you became a 
faculty member in 1954?

22:35.257 --> 22:42.867
Well, we were down in the building, down in the 
civil engineering building on the second floor.

22:44.449 --> 22:55.262
Hilton had his office in one building and it was a

22:44.449 --> 22:55.262
room that had a place for a secretary and a lab. and 
we were assigned various offices down. You'd get

23:01.732 --> 23:11.203
one here and one there and I had an office down there 
and that was

23:01.732 --> 23:11.203
pretty much it. There was only about four of us. 
Only one lab? One lab. But did each of you have a

23:15.729 --> 23:19.073
workspace in that lab? We had a place where we had, 
those were rather large rooms, and we had to have a

23:21.584 --> 23:31.758
table where we could store some of our specimens, 
stuff like that. But all of the lab work, which was

23:32.339 --> 23:40.570
then, was pretty much cut and dried paraffin and 
embedded pathology tissues. And that was about

23:41.631 --> 23:44.916
it, yeah. And for faculty? I believe that was about 
it.

23:51.554 --> 23:54.598
later what I took over was five. Hilton resigned. 
Alright and what were your duties when you began?

24:02.329 --> 24:04.652
What courses, what assignments? I helped, worked 
in the laboratory, teaching laboratory of the

24:04.892 --> 24:21.274
histopathology part of Hilton's course and then 
full of necropsy duty which is servicing the the

24:22.064 --> 24:25.568
animals that came from a clinic. And Hilda did most 
of the histopathology then, the biopsies and

24:26.629 --> 24:32.415
stuff that they wanted tumor. That was his 
business, he took care of that. At that time we had

24:36.640 --> 24:43.807
no research at the time, but later they did 
develop. Which, in which courses in the

24:44.688 --> 24:49.253
veterinary curriculum did Joel Did you all have 
some for all three years?

24:57.330 --> 25:16.050
There was one basic course in veterinary 
pathology, then later they developed a course in

24:57.330 --> 25:16.050
clinical pathology, and then there was a duty with 
the clinic later on that was developed. And about

25:17.802 --> 25:22.829
how many students were in each veterinary class 
then that was admitted? Basically 64. 64. All

25:26.815 --> 25:30.701
male, all Texans? All male and mostly all Texans, 
but I don't remember.

25:38.792 --> 25:44.721
The next day I signed a contract with the state of 
Louisiana to accept nine students from

25:47.671 --> 25:50.515
Normally were those nine students good students? 
They were good students because they were

25:50.695 --> 26:02.169
selected mostly from the applicants from LSU that 
took the pre-vet, and they knew that that pre-vet

25:50.695 --> 26:02.169
program was there. They were mostly good 
students, yes. Describe some of your early

26:07.195 --> 26:12.582
teaching experiences with What were some of the 
things that you soon learned you were going to

26:13.625 --> 26:19.812
encounter? What were the students like as they 
began their coursework?

26:34.508 --> 26:43.378
Well, basically the department was pretty stark, 
and the students were fairly quiet. They

26:45.828 --> 26:47.992
responded accordingly. And I don't know of any 
particular exciting times that were at that. Did

26:57.569 --> 27:04.060
they think of pathology as a hard course or easy? I 
figured it was one of the harder courses. And

27:08.047 --> 27:09.349
they'd take it the first year?

27:15.134 --> 27:18.138
It was the fourth year. And your... The year 
preceded graduation. Okay. Describe a typical

27:25.448 --> 27:30.955
day for you as a young faculty member. What time did 
you get there? What did you do? What time did you

27:33.178 --> 27:34.520
come home? Well, we were there at 8 o'clock. And you 
know, it was five days, six days a week. And we were

27:41.109 --> 27:43.993
out at 8 and... we'd have a class, there'd be a 
lecture in which we would attend, Ronald Hilton

27:44.750 --> 27:58.904
would lecture and then we would go into the labs, 
which here we used the two sections twice a week.

28:00.025 --> 28:14.520
And we would prepare that and go in there and the 
students would all have a microscope and they

28:00.025 --> 28:14.520
would, we would circulate among them and they'd 
have to answer their questions. And then we'd ask

28:15.344 --> 28:21.899
them questions and set up practical exams and 
things like that. And that was over whether it was

28:23.663 --> 28:30.358
back to work or research or whatever we were doing. 
What time would you normally come home? I don't

28:33.565 --> 28:34.467
know what time. It was usually home for dinner and 
then back to level. So you came home for lunch

28:39.900 --> 28:46.327
midday and then... Went back. Went back. And then 
came home say maybe about 6 to eat. Okay. Then went

28:52.174 --> 28:57.340
back and didn't come home until about 11. It was 
interesting enough to... And we felt that's what

28:57.740 --> 29:04.588
we should be doing. Did you feel well accepted as a 
junior faculty member by your colleagues? Yes, I

29:11.532 --> 29:12.573
think so.

29:15.717 --> 29:25.851
I think that there was that peer, not peer, but that 
relationship of the senior professor and the

29:15.717 --> 29:25.851
junior professor. I could see that, but it didn't 
bother me because I've been brought up in a

29:25.871 --> 29:33.141
discipline world all my life. Did the students 
soon develop a nickname for you?

29:42.385 --> 29:42.946
I'm not sure. My son

29:44.147 --> 29:50.774
got, my son got a time to borrow some notes. He 
graduated from that, from one of the students. His

29:56.079 --> 30:00.824
classmates, in that, he found in the back of it, he 
says, what's that, Bridget? He'll get your A.

30:06.753 --> 30:14.401
At that time, what do you think was the reputation 
of the School of Veterinary Medicine here

30:06.753 --> 30:14.401
nationally? How did we... I think it was 
respected, but I think it was also downgraded

30:16.062 --> 30:33.520
because it was a school of the South, and that thing 
which hangs over anything in the South is not good

30:16.062 --> 30:33.520
as it is in the East. And the only vet school 
anywhere near was Oklahoma State? Oklahoma

30:40.560 --> 30:44.467
State, I think, was developed in the 50s or so. I was 
on faculty here before they were developed. Oh, so

30:50.476 --> 30:51.678
it wasn't, okay. No, it didn't exist. So

30:53.000 --> 30:59.531
Kenton State had one? Kenton State was an old 
school. Okay. And Cornell. But there wasn't one to

31:02.976 --> 31:06.861
go all the way to... Even Georgia was a bloke in the 
50s. Okay. Auburn had one. Yeah. Auburn had one,

31:12.149 --> 31:14.852
and I don't remember the dates of those. I've never 
been bothered by those things. That was one of the

31:18.497 --> 31:29.612
problems I had in classes, that if there were 
eponyms, I refused to learn them. I know that about

31:30.250 --> 31:36.645
one flunked me on my pre-lab because I didn't know 
what Ben Ness's walker disease was. I said, yeah,

31:38.129 --> 31:45.947
sure, I'll tell you all about it.
