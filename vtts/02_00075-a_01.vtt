WEBVTT

00:03.912 --> 00:05.375
Testing, one, two, three, four.

00:09.923 --> 00:25.650
This is January the 11th, 2002, and I have the honor and pleasure of visiting with Doug Ferrata at his very fine home in Albuquerque to record his A&M memories.

00:26.018 --> 00:31.784
Doug, to begin with, give a brief biographical summary of yourself before getting to A&M.

00:32.285 --> 00:35.668
Family background, where'd you grow up, high school, what did mom and dad do?

00:36.129 --> 00:44.058
Okay, I grew up in Houston and lived just north of Rice University.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.179
And went to St.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.501
Ann's Elementary and St.

00:47.541 --> 00:48.342
Thomas High School.

00:49.884 --> 00:55.570
And my father sold cars and my mother had passed away when I was nine years old.

00:57.541 --> 01:00.887
And I guess that's about it.

01:01.869 --> 01:05.436
Any important activities in junior or senior high?

01:06.518 --> 01:07.260
No, nothing outstanding.

01:07.280 --> 01:12.149
I was in scouts mostly and junior achievement, those kinds of activities.

01:12.169 --> 01:16.778
I wasn't large enough to really be good at sports, and so I hadn't played any sports.

01:16.798 --> 01:17.980
Why did you attend A&M?

01:18.888 --> 01:22.213
I attended A&M primarily because my big brother had gone there.

01:22.233 --> 01:43.326
My brother John is class of 57 and he had gone to the University of Houston for the first semester of college and then had seen A&M at a football game and looked at those boots and thought those were kind of cool and so the second semester freshman year he became a frog and went off to A&M.

01:44.150 --> 01:45.812
And the rest is history.

01:45.832 --> 01:47.574
There's been a lot of Aggies since him.

01:47.754 --> 01:49.696
Had you gone up to visit while he was there?

01:50.056 --> 01:51.358
I went up a lot when he was there.

01:52.118 --> 01:56.343
He would go up and spend the night in the dorms and those sorts of things.

01:56.363 --> 01:57.364
Pretty much got ingrained.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.967
I mean, by the time I went to college, that was the only place I was going to go.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.128
It was the only place I applied.

02:02.529 --> 02:04.872
What did you like most about it?

02:04.912 --> 02:07.675
What impressed you most before you got there?

02:08.556 --> 02:08.976
The Corps.

02:10.077 --> 02:12.520
I thought the Corps was pretty neat.

02:13.343 --> 02:22.351
and the camaraderie, the band, you know, the typical things about A&M that get to you.

02:22.952 --> 02:26.395
I was pretty much bleeding maroon by the time I went to college.

02:26.595 --> 02:31.459
So you applied, and this is for fall of 19... Fall of 1963.

02:31.479 --> 02:33.261
63.

02:34.422 --> 02:37.845
And did you go to fish camp?

02:37.865 --> 02:38.346
No, did not.

02:39.006 --> 02:39.066
No.

02:39.086 --> 02:39.827
And I went right in.

02:39.907 --> 02:42.169
My first experience was...

02:42.959 --> 02:44.701
I can remember this like it was yesterday.

02:44.741 --> 02:57.034
My parents drove me up there or my father drove me up there and stopped outside of dorm 12 and let me off with my footlocker.

02:57.934 --> 02:58.615
What did you have in it?

02:59.196 --> 03:00.958
Oh, you know, all the standard stuff.

03:00.998 --> 03:07.464
I mean, there was a list of the things you had to have, you know, and had the clothes and a few other things.

03:07.504 --> 03:11.008
I think you couldn't have a radio or a lot of things you couldn't have.

03:11.883 --> 03:14.366
And that's another story I'll get back to in a second.

03:14.406 --> 03:23.836
But I can remember they left me off on the street side, the zip strip side of the dorm.

03:23.856 --> 03:36.490
And I walked around the side with my suitcase and walked in, not the indoor, but the north door on the quad side and walked up two flights of stairs.

03:37.988 --> 03:51.786
And as I rounded to go up the third flight of stairs, I saw two pair of boots standing at the top of the stairs, whose names I would later learn were Lew Zewski, the squadron commander, and John Hull, the executive officer.

03:53.027 --> 03:56.131
And my world changed at that moment.

03:56.512 --> 03:59.676
How did they change it?

04:00.314 --> 04:03.098
They informed me right away that I was fish ferrata.

04:03.218 --> 04:09.446
Well, first of all, I went up, and I kind of knew how to whip out, but didn't do it, and that didn't go over really well.

04:10.728 --> 04:21.322
And they, in kind of a nice way, informed me that I was fish ferrata and turned me over to some of the pissheads, so I can't, it's kind of a blur after that right now.

04:21.502 --> 04:22.303
Now, what outfit was this?

04:22.383 --> 04:23.104
Squadron 13.

04:23.685 --> 04:26.348
Do you have any idea how you ended up in that squadron?

04:26.669 --> 04:28.231
No, no, it was just luck of the draw.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.072
I hadn't...

04:30.065 --> 04:30.906
hadn't applied for it.

04:30.926 --> 04:31.907
I was just told I was in third grade.

04:31.927 --> 04:34.390
And you had learned by mail which dorm?

04:34.730 --> 04:35.951
Which dorm and everything, yeah.

04:36.172 --> 04:37.814
And then got there and just showed up at dorm 12.

04:38.534 --> 04:42.218
And I had an idea what to expect, but like anybody, you can't fully appreciate it.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.920
Had your older brother given you any advice?

04:45.782 --> 04:47.284
No, not a whole lot.

04:47.304 --> 04:51.008
I mean, he knew that I had come up there and experienced it with him.

04:51.028 --> 04:55.353
I'd spent enough time in the dorm with him and seen how things functioned and that sort of stuff.

04:55.373 --> 04:59.177
He pretty much, I think, thought that I understood what I was getting into.

04:59.275 --> 05:01.297
Did mom and dad give you any advice?

05:02.419 --> 05:04.801
No, I just studied hard.

05:06.043 --> 05:12.190
You know, my father had told me I was going to be an engineer, so that's what I did.

05:12.330 --> 05:12.931
And that was your?

05:13.151 --> 05:19.218
And I went up there and started aerospace engineering and five years later graduated in aerospace engineering, you know, and then stayed and got my masters.

05:19.638 --> 05:25.705
What, as far as you know, what did that first year cost in round numbers?

05:27.693 --> 05:32.860
I can remember it almost exactly because I had to borrow money to go to college.

05:32.880 --> 05:40.389
It cost me about $1,600 total from what I borrowed and what I made during the summers.

05:41.050 --> 05:45.556
It was about $1,600 total to go to A&M.

05:45.576 --> 05:47.359
And did you have some spending money?

05:47.419 --> 05:47.999
If so, how much?

05:48.140 --> 05:48.580
Not much.

05:48.901 --> 05:51.604
No, I mean, I had to milk that all year long.

05:52.225 --> 05:56.991
And outside of occasionally my dad buying gas for my car,

05:57.207 --> 05:58.709
I didn't have a whole lot of money.

05:58.809 --> 06:04.657
I ate a lot in the mess hall, and I was really glad that they served three meals a day in the mess hall.

06:04.677 --> 06:07.120
Because if they had not, it would probably start to death.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.523
I ate a lot in the mess hall.

06:09.543 --> 06:09.744
All right.

06:09.784 --> 06:14.770
Describe your first two or three days and nights as you get assimilated into that unit.

06:15.832 --> 06:17.134
Well, you know, it's the standard thing.

06:17.154 --> 06:24.143
You get put in this environment and thrown together with all your fish buddies, and your hair gets cut and everything else.

06:25.591 --> 06:30.936
And again, I don't know that I can pull out any specific memories of those first couple of days because it was a blur.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.799
Did you get your hair cut at the MSC?

06:35.240 --> 06:36.701
No, I think they took us to Northgate.

06:36.941 --> 06:38.082
It was a barber shop at Northgate.

06:38.103 --> 06:39.524
They took us there and had our hair cut.

06:40.104 --> 06:41.406
How long was your hair before then?

06:41.806 --> 06:42.286
Not very.

06:42.627 --> 06:43.167
Not very.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.631
And so I really didn't miss it that much.

06:48.432 --> 06:53.877
And got put into a room with my first official lady guy named Larry Lippey from Lockhart, Texas.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.882
And that, I presume, was by luck?

06:56.222 --> 06:56.843
It was by luck.

06:57.263 --> 06:57.824
All by luck.

06:57.964 --> 07:00.387
Describe how you all set up the room.

07:00.487 --> 07:00.887
What all?

07:01.348 --> 07:02.249
Well, I mean, there was nothing.

07:02.669 --> 07:06.473
I mean, you didn't have to worry about arranging the rooms because there was nothing.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.295
I mean, we had those old steel beds.

07:09.677 --> 07:10.538
And then two desks.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.460
And that's all that we had.

07:13.981 --> 07:15.683
No rugs, of course, or anything else like that.

07:15.723 --> 07:17.105
Just absolutely, totally stark.

07:18.907 --> 07:19.728
What about that radio?

07:20.188 --> 07:22.851
Well, what I can remember was

07:23.152 --> 07:29.718
It was depressing enough being a fish in the court and not having any money and not being able to go do anything.

07:30.319 --> 07:36.705
And I can remember, we were only, I think, allowed to play radios on the weekend.

07:37.786 --> 07:44.373
And I can remember waking up on Sunday morning and you'd turn on the radio and there was only WTAW and KTRA.

07:45.514 --> 07:50.359
And they both played oom-pah music in the morning on Sunday morning.

07:50.379 --> 07:51.640
And that was more depressing.

07:51.822 --> 07:55.249
than if I hadn't have turned the radio on.

07:55.269 --> 07:57.292
Because we weren't allowed to have record players or anything like that.

07:57.373 --> 08:00.619
So, I mean, everything was designed to make it as depressing as possible.

08:02.202 --> 08:09.055
Now, didn't the sophomores or juniors get you all together and give you a lecture?

08:09.075 --> 08:10.377
Oh, yeah.

08:10.397 --> 08:11.379
I mean, the standard stuff.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.864
Describe that.

08:14.671 --> 08:22.318
you know, being on the wall and doing campusology and lecturing to us about how bad we were and those sorts of things.

08:23.399 --> 08:29.024
I'm trying to think of some specific instances about that.

08:31.627 --> 08:36.011
And of course, there were a couple of piss heads that you, you know, that would really rag on you all the time.

08:36.511 --> 08:41.056
One of the funny stories that happened, this wasn't then, I'm diverting a little.

08:41.096 --> 08:42.417
Towards the end of fish year,

08:43.662 --> 08:48.690
There were two piss heads that lived next door to us that were ragging on us all the time.

08:50.212 --> 08:56.502
And it was one of the last inspections of the year, one of the last standby inspections.

08:56.522 --> 09:09.062
And in those days the medicine cabinets in the rooms were back to back to each other and there was a razor slot in the back of the cabinet.

09:09.802 --> 09:32.265
We had this thing planned for them and so we heard the dorm call to order and as soon as the dorm was called to attention we went to our medicine cabinet and opened it up and I took a can of shaving cream and a straw and stuck it through the razor slot into their medicine cabinet and emptied the can of a shaving ladder into their medicine cabinet.

09:32.465 --> 09:36.992
And then we're standing there by our bunks and we can hear their room as the officers come into their room.

09:37.313 --> 09:42.581
And you heard their medicine cabinet open.

09:42.601 --> 09:47.870
And you can kind of hear this because everything fell out of the medicine cabinet into this thing.

09:48.290 --> 09:52.918
And I can remember some expletive that the officers did at that time.

09:52.938 --> 09:54.380
We paid for that, but it was worth it.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.942
What kind of payment did you all get?

09:55.962 --> 09:57.285
Oh, they came over and got on us.

09:58.527 --> 10:00.109
You know, I think...

10:01.709 --> 10:09.202
If I remember correctly, that did happen before Fish Day on April 1st.

10:10.745 --> 10:19.140
And on Fish Day at about 2 o'clock in the morning, a babble bomb went off in our room.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.005
And Richard Ripley was my roommate.

10:22.045 --> 10:26.873
And this thing went off because it was totally dark and this thing just BOOM!

10:27.106 --> 10:33.233
an M-80 or a cherry bomb going off in those concrete rooms, the sound echoing off the walls.

10:34.054 --> 10:40.682
And my old lady flipped on his lice first, and he said, old lady, the room's full of smoke.

10:41.483 --> 10:45.948
And I said, no, that's not smoke.

10:45.969 --> 10:50.834
And shoot for a month after that, every time you'd wipe anything in the room, it would raise a lather.

10:51.135 --> 10:53.097
That stuff went all over the place.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.101
Oh, man.

10:56.701 --> 10:56.942
All right.

10:58.003 --> 11:00.185
How did you all learn all the campusology?

11:00.565 --> 11:09.995
Oh, we'd just get together and, you know, they'd allow us to pick up one at a time, so we'd all get together and memorize it and keep asking each other the campusology and that sort of stuff.

11:10.195 --> 11:14.439
Do you remember any great Cush questions?

11:14.459 --> 11:17.382
Oh, yeah, there's some great ones.

11:17.462 --> 11:18.183
Let's see.

11:20.465 --> 11:21.346
And there's some good trick ones.

11:21.366 --> 11:23.488
Let me see if I can remember some of them.

11:28.312 --> 11:38.628
I mean, there were always the standard quotes like, you know, Lawrence Sullivan, Ross Silverstein, the General Brigadier General, CSA, Governor Texas President, Indian College, you know, that sort of stuff.

11:38.648 --> 11:49.324
And what was on the chemistry building, but... Oh shoot, I can't... One of my favorites is, how many stars are in the Texas flag?

11:51.008 --> 11:52.611
Okay, it's got to be tricked.

11:53.592 --> 11:55.295
If you say one, no, there's two.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.137
There's one on each side.

11:56.157 --> 11:57.058
Not on each side, that's right.

11:57.078 --> 11:58.661
If you say there's two, no, there's one.

11:58.681 --> 11:59.763
It goes through both ways.

11:59.783 --> 12:00.123
That's right.

12:00.143 --> 12:01.766
Therefore, you don't get to eat it.

12:02.027 --> 12:02.607
You don't get it.

12:03.749 --> 12:05.072
There was something about bricks.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.654
How many bricks were there in such and such?

12:06.915 --> 12:07.175
Oh, my.

12:07.195 --> 12:08.658
And the answer was all of them.

12:08.878 --> 12:11.102
You know, it was... Well, that's a good one.

12:11.142 --> 12:11.362
Yeah.

12:13.125 --> 12:13.726
No Cush questions.

12:13.786 --> 12:16.611
Cush, you knew if it was good Cush, you were never going to get it anyway, so...

12:17.131 --> 12:19.776
Now, you all ate in Duncan.

12:20.317 --> 12:24.666
Describe the routine in your outfit for typical meals.

12:25.067 --> 12:33.604
Well, of course, you had two freshmen sitting on the end that did meal service, and the freshman waiters were bringing the food to the table, and then it was your job to make sure that

12:33.972 --> 13:03.557
that you got the right stuff from there to put out, and that wasn't meal service, that was called, shoot, I can't remember what it was, but then you had two freshmen, you had two seniors or two juniors at one end, and then two freshmen next to them, and then two piss heads, and then two freshmen at the end that worked with the waiters that were coming in, the two freshmen that sat next to the seniors or juniors did meal service for them, and so you had to know what they liked, and you had to always make sure that they had the right stuff on their plate, and that they didn't have something on the plate that they didn't like,

13:04.178 --> 13:09.885
and that you protected them from anything that might happen.

13:09.950 --> 13:23.402
Like, for instance, somebody coming up under the table and lighting their shoelaces on fire or something like that, or coming, there was always the threat that some fish would come behind them and slap butter in their ear or something like that.

13:24.143 --> 13:26.165
Did that ever happen in Europe?

13:26.885 --> 13:29.207
No.

13:30.268 --> 13:36.274
And in Aggie food, what was your favorite and your least favorite?

13:37.495 --> 13:39.957
Well, I like bull neck and spuds.

13:40.443 --> 13:49.414
and cow, and I don't know that I had at least, I was, like I say, I ate just about everything that came along.

13:49.494 --> 13:53.299
I couldn't afford to tear food away, and so I ate just about everything.

13:53.319 --> 13:57.244
Did you ever get in trouble at home by using some Aggie Turr?

13:57.324 --> 13:58.926
No, no, never did that.

13:58.966 --> 14:03.672
Never talked about, you know, after birth and baby and all those good things.

14:03.692 --> 14:05.214
A few guys have said, yep.

14:05.234 --> 14:06.335
All those good things.

14:07.277 --> 14:08.458
No, I knew better than to do that.

14:09.113 --> 14:11.215
Let's see.

14:13.377 --> 14:16.399
Your outfit, what was special about it?

14:18.201 --> 14:19.962
What was really special was the CO.

14:20.843 --> 14:21.964
The guy's name was Louis Zeske.

14:23.005 --> 14:23.906
How do you spell him?

14:23.986 --> 14:25.247
Z-A-E-S-K-E.

14:25.267 --> 14:26.868
Yeah, yeah.

14:26.888 --> 14:35.355
And Lou had gotten into trouble, you know, as we were discussing before the interview, we were talking about the process of A&M going co-ed.

14:36.937 --> 14:38.378
Lou had gotten into trouble.

14:38.628 --> 14:42.233
before his senior year for hanging Earl Rudder in effigy at Northgate.

14:44.096 --> 14:51.627
And so he had kind of been in trouble with the Trigon.

14:52.448 --> 14:55.512
And as it turned out, he never did get a commission, which I think was a shame.

14:57.595 --> 15:00.119
Because he was a tremendous inspirational leader.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.863
I mean, we would have marched, you know,

15:03.586 --> 15:05.049
to hell and back with him.

15:05.069 --> 15:06.231
He was just a hell of a guy.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.619
He's one of those kind of people that you really respected.

15:10.861 --> 15:16.152
And because of that, I mean, it was a pretty tight outfit.

15:17.575 --> 15:19.519
Did you all have an outfit nickname?

15:20.377 --> 15:21.879
No, not at that time.

15:24.043 --> 15:26.507
We weren't like Foo Bird, which was 14.

15:27.549 --> 15:28.650
We were just Squadron 13.

15:29.251 --> 15:31.595
And you stayed in that outfit?

15:31.755 --> 15:37.805
Stayed in that outfit for two years and then due to reorganization we became Squadron 10.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.570
We were called Titan 10 at the time.

15:41.271 --> 15:42.553
Engineers in both cases?

15:42.573 --> 15:43.655
Primarily engineers, yeah.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.481
Let's do academics.

15:48.237 --> 15:49.299
How did you register?

15:49.500 --> 15:50.983
Do you remember registering the first time?

15:51.003 --> 15:51.966
Oh, we were standing outside of Cebisa.

15:52.908 --> 15:56.055
In those long lines outside of Cebisa to go in and register.

15:56.095 --> 16:02.550
And you'd go up to the desk that offered the course you wanted to, and if they had it, they'd give you an IBM punch card.

16:03.003 --> 16:15.439
and you'd collect all these punch cards and you had to know about conflicts and you had to work all that stuff out there and then finally when you got all the cards that you needed, you went inside and presented that and registered for your course.

16:15.939 --> 16:18.022
I can remember staying out there with long lines.

16:18.042 --> 16:20.605
Do you remember going to your first classes?

16:21.126 --> 16:23.629
What was it like that first semester?

16:23.749 --> 16:32.200
Well, of course your freshman year, particularly freshman chemistry, you know, you're in that huge auditorium with all those people in there.

16:33.850 --> 16:36.693
I was really, really excited about that, going to the first classes.

16:37.714 --> 16:41.558
I don't remember anything in particular, though.

16:41.578 --> 16:47.424
Of course, in those days, too, unlike now, I mean, you were a target anywhere on campus as a fish.

16:48.305 --> 16:50.547
And, of course, I can remember a lot of times trying to get to class.

16:51.808 --> 16:58.575
And, you know, there'd be some upper classman I knew who was walking to somebody I didn't know, going the direction I wasn't going.

16:58.825 --> 17:04.332
So I'd have to walk along and talk to them for a while, and then lo and behold, here comes somebody else that I'd have to meet.

17:04.973 --> 17:08.898
And it was always a challenge trying to get to class, you know.

17:08.918 --> 17:15.466
Did you have any, looking back on it, did you have any classes that first semester that were important to you later?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.071
Important to me later, no.

17:19.131 --> 17:21.854
Some people, some learning experiences?

17:22.315 --> 17:23.837
No, nothing really stands out.

17:24.526 --> 17:30.713
Now, I presume that in almost every case, you had a full-time faculty member teaching the courses.

17:30.933 --> 17:32.415
Almost every case, yeah.

17:32.435 --> 17:34.517
And you were taking 18, 19 hours?

17:35.278 --> 17:35.579
Yeah.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.661
I look on that now.

17:38.202 --> 17:43.087
In particular, I had two sons who, I've got one son who just recently graduated and another son who's a junior.

17:44.289 --> 17:48.573
And, you know, right now when they go in, they talk about only taking 12 hours for the first semester.

17:49.475 --> 17:51.857
And I think I took 18 hours my first semester in engineering.

17:51.897 --> 17:53.419
Sure.

17:54.783 --> 17:59.930
I didn't really have a life as an engineering major.

18:01.433 --> 18:05.498
I mean, all my nights and all my weekends were spending the norm studying, you know.

18:05.939 --> 18:06.179
All right.

18:06.199 --> 18:08.543
Describe a typical class day.

18:08.623 --> 18:12.789
What time did you get up and what happened from the time you got up to the time you went to bed?

18:13.530 --> 18:18.377
I think first call was like at 6, if I remember correctly, and then you'd fall out at 620.

18:19.285 --> 18:22.469
You had somebody else's room to look after?

18:22.509 --> 18:24.631
Did you have an upperclassman to look after?

18:24.731 --> 18:26.393
No, we didn't do that in our outfit.

18:26.553 --> 18:27.234
We didn't have to do that.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.638
You only had to take care of yourself.

18:30.838 --> 18:39.568
And we would fall out on the wall and of course the piss heads would go over you in minute detail as to what was right and wrong.

18:40.609 --> 18:48.178
And then you'd fall out.

18:48.648 --> 19:15.567
downstairs and get in formation and of course we were in dorm 12 which is right next to Duncan and march in and eat chow in the morning and then you'd come back after you ate chow if you got to eat anything although we did actually get to eat pretty well what they would do is you know after a while they'd let up on you and allow you to finish or they'd leave and allow you to finish your food and that sort of stuff

19:15.901 --> 19:21.312
and breakfast was one of my favorite meals, and so I'd scarf down as much of that as I could.

19:21.954 --> 19:29.329
And then go back to the dorm, then you get your room ready for inspection, and then usually the first class was at 8 o'clock, and you headed off to class.

19:30.632 --> 19:36.424
And then you had to be back in the dorm area at noon to get information to march to noon chow.

19:37.855 --> 19:46.523
And then you had noon chow, and then if you had class, you went back, or if you didn't, you could, your room had to be ready for inspection until noon.

19:47.824 --> 19:56.211
And then afternoon, if you went back and didn't have class, you could rack out in your bunk or whatever you wanted to, or go to class.

19:56.651 --> 20:06.580
And then you had to be back in the dorm area in the evening, and formed up for evening chow, and went to chow, and then

20:07.353 --> 20:14.721
intramurals if you had that, and of course CQ at night from, I can't remember, it was either 7 to 10 or 7.30 to 10.30.

20:14.741 --> 20:18.585
Now, if you had any unscheduled time, where did you go to relax?

20:19.766 --> 20:20.107
MSC.

20:21.308 --> 20:22.229
Where in the MSC?

20:22.429 --> 20:26.774
Oh, I'm trying to remember.

20:29.457 --> 20:32.660
There was kind of a snack bar cafeteria in the bowling alley.

20:32.680 --> 20:37.005
Of course, I go over there and check my spider in my mailbox, make sure he was healthy.

20:37.863 --> 20:52.680
and just kind of sit around the MSC in general, maybe go down, let's see if I remember there was a bookstore at the time in there or down the bowling alley, just in general.

20:55.083 --> 20:55.664
Then at night?

20:56.245 --> 21:02.672
Then at night it was CQ and it was studying and then when CQ was over you had 30 minutes to

21:03.547 --> 21:08.855
to get your room ready, get your brass ready, get your uniform ready for the next day, all that sort of stuff.

21:08.975 --> 21:14.783
And then if you stayed up after that, you got what was called a late lights pass, where you could stay up after CQ.

21:15.384 --> 21:16.265
Did you all do that much?

21:16.345 --> 21:17.747
Oh, yeah, I had to.

21:18.008 --> 21:20.712
I mean, I barely ever got to bed before midnight.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.637
And were people really studying?

21:24.737 --> 21:26.079
Oh, yeah.

21:26.340 --> 21:27.301
We really studied.

21:28.763 --> 21:30.786
And in those days...

21:32.386 --> 21:42.259
Which, you know, like I said, I've got two sons that just went through and I had some real problems with some of the stuff that was going on now with piss heads coming in our ass and freshmen during CQ and some of those things.

21:42.899 --> 21:44.622
But our outfit was real good about that.

21:44.782 --> 21:47.465
You did not, CQ was pretty much sacrosanct.

21:49.087 --> 21:54.073
And unlike today, the outfits were formed on majors.

21:54.875 --> 21:59.220
And so it was kind of, in the evening,

21:59.825 --> 22:09.740
kind of academic time and you could go to a sophomore's room and ask for help on, you know, math problems or other things like that and they would give you some pretty good help.

22:10.281 --> 22:12.685
And of course you had the outfit quiz files and those sorts of things.

22:13.686 --> 22:18.133
But it was, there wasn't a whole lot of time in an engineering outfit for messing around.

22:19.115 --> 22:27.908
What did you, you and your closest buddies, what were your general guidelines for attending class and where did you sit and how did you behave in class and so forth?

22:28.445 --> 22:30.168
You usually like to sit up towards the front.

22:31.070 --> 22:37.401
In hours, you know, most of the guys in the outfit, the guys that lasted, were pretty serious about academics.

22:38.563 --> 22:45.856
And, you know, you like to sit up in front, because if you sat up in front, it was less of a chance you were going to fall asleep.

22:45.876 --> 22:48.080
And you, you know, the prof got to see you.

22:49.142 --> 22:51.145
And...

22:51.496 --> 23:00.624
And most of our guys, you know, we were pretty judicious about attending class and, you know, I mean, it doesn't sound very exciting, but when you go in for an engineering degree, you know, you don't have a whole lot of choice.

23:03.347 --> 23:03.767
Let's see.

23:05.429 --> 23:10.754
Anybody ever do any, in all the four years, any pranks in class that you remember?

23:12.475 --> 23:13.056
By anybody?

23:17.660 --> 23:20.102
No, but a lot of good pranks out of class.

23:20.926 --> 23:21.467
Such as?

23:21.847 --> 23:28.897
Well, right after we got there, I mean, this was like the third week we were in the dorm.

23:29.178 --> 23:35.447
We used to have these large trash cans out in the halls, and they were called shit cans.

23:35.467 --> 23:36.889
Everything's got its name.

23:38.130 --> 23:40.674
Well, one morning we had no shit cans.

23:41.315 --> 23:43.558
Somebody came in and stolen all of our shit cans.

23:45.074 --> 23:52.767
And so Lou Zewski, Mr. Zewski, informed us that we were going to have shit cans the next morning.

23:54.430 --> 23:58.657
So that night, all the fish got together, and we plotted out what we were going to do, and we divided up the quad.

23:58.897 --> 24:01.321
And like I say, this was right after we'd gotten there, so we really didn't know.

24:01.341 --> 24:04.486
We knew there were 12 dorms, but we had no idea which dorms were which.

24:05.989 --> 24:09.715
So my old lady, Larry Lippey, and I drew dorm two.

24:11.399 --> 24:12.861
We had no idea what dorm 2 was.

24:12.901 --> 24:13.722
And so we're right down.

24:13.762 --> 24:17.786
You know, this is like 2 o'clock in the morning, and we're skulking through dorm 2 trying to get these cans.

24:17.826 --> 24:21.751
And I looked up on the door, and here it says, Cadet Colonel of the Corps.

24:22.812 --> 24:25.274
Cadet Sergeant Major of the Corps.

24:25.975 --> 24:30.380
And I realized really quick we were in the wrong place.

24:31.141 --> 24:40.191
But both of us grabbed a can, and we ran out the south door of the dorm and ran towards...

24:41.200 --> 24:53.296
Spence Park, and about that time, as we're, I can't remember what it was, we were running across the park for some reason.

24:53.316 --> 25:07.714
I think we were going to kind of organize, and there used to be some homes on the other side of the park, and we were going to organize over there and then bring all the cans back or something, and we got about halfway across the park, and a KK comes by, and my old lady,

25:08.285 --> 25:12.971
puts down his can and hides behind it in the middle of the park.

25:14.934 --> 25:18.699
And shortly after that, he realized that wasn't a really sharp thing to do, so he picked it up and ran off.

25:19.119 --> 25:21.102
It wasn't too much trouble to run away from in those days.

25:21.923 --> 25:23.565
But that was number one.

25:23.665 --> 25:35.541
The other major prank of our fish year was in the second semester, Zesky had gone someplace for the weekend.

25:36.483 --> 25:39.207
And the seniors told us to brick up his door.

25:40.448 --> 25:52.205
There were some homes that were across the park from the dorms that were being torn down at the time, that used to be all along that road, now where that big parking garage is.

25:52.325 --> 25:54.728
And there were piles of bricks over there.

25:55.282 --> 26:10.345
So Tommy Stone, who was an outstanding member of our class, Tommy, just a side note, Tommy went on to be commander of the RVs and head Yellier our senior year.

26:11.286 --> 26:20.901
But Tommy, we got Tommy's car, and we're driving over getting these bricks, and we just loaded up a whole bunch of bricks in the car, and we start to drive off, and again a KK comes up.

26:21.927 --> 26:26.052
And Tommy stops and gets out of the car really immediately and walks back to the KK's car.

26:26.092 --> 26:28.935
And I think he was so flustered, the KK was so flustered, he didn't know what to do.

26:29.456 --> 26:32.039
So Tommy fed him some line about what we were doing out at that time.

26:32.739 --> 26:33.380
And he let him go.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.463
So we went on back to the dorm.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.407
And there was a parking lot on the south side of the dorm.

26:39.427 --> 26:41.069
So we drove in there and unloaded all these bricks.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.632
And we'd gotten some martyr from someplace.

26:44.313 --> 26:48.778
And this room was on the third stoop on the end, on the north end.

26:49.788 --> 26:54.833
We carried all these bricks upstairs and about two o'clock in the morning we start laying brick.

26:54.853 --> 26:59.538
And if you walk in the door, you know, there's closet doors on either side in the dorm, and then the room widens out.

26:59.558 --> 27:01.620
Well, right where the room winds out, we built a brick wall.

27:01.860 --> 27:02.220
Literally.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.243
Literally built a brick wall right there with mortar.

27:06.264 --> 27:09.087
And got finished like four o'clock in the morning and went to bed.

27:09.127 --> 27:16.274
And I can remember like at six o'clock in the morning, Zesky got back.

27:16.915 --> 27:18.276
And I can remember...

27:18.982 --> 27:20.908
hearing fresh mud.

27:24.721 --> 27:28.614
So we all fell out and went back down and took them all down.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.460
How did you all keep straight faces?

27:31.064 --> 27:32.205
Oh, he knew we'd done it.

27:32.666 --> 27:33.507
Yeah, I don't know.

27:33.747 --> 27:34.788
So that nobody asked.

27:34.908 --> 27:35.409
Nobody asked.

27:35.429 --> 27:37.471
Nobody asked where this wall came from or something.

27:37.511 --> 27:50.745
But I can remember, whether I talked to somebody or something, the look on his face, I guess one of the upperclassmen had told me this after that, that he had unlocked the door and walked in and just got this black look on his face as he faces his brick wall right inside of his room.

27:52.527 --> 27:53.808
But nobody was hurt or anything?

27:53.828 --> 27:54.789
Oh, nobody was hurt, no.

27:56.371 --> 28:00.295
And there were other pranks, like somebody, one of the upperclassmen had an MGTC.

28:00.781 --> 28:10.173
and this wasn't our outfit, I think it was Fulbert 14, that they dismantled the car and reassembled it in the hallway in the dorm.

28:11.194 --> 28:21.607
And I can remember seeing that car sitting there in, sitting in the dorm, like on the floor, and then they had to disassemble and take it out.

28:21.788 --> 28:28.476
In that first fall, describe a fish going to first football games.

28:29.924 --> 28:32.787
What was the routine and how did you all get into it?

28:33.688 --> 28:37.792
Well, of course, everybody went to the game in those days, unlike today.

28:37.972 --> 28:40.154
Did they tell you how to behave or what to do?

28:41.095 --> 28:52.227
Well, you know, I mean, you knew about wildcatting and you knew you had to stand and you knew, of course, at the end of the game, you had to be ready to get the L leaders if we'd outscored the opponents.

28:53.548 --> 28:57.552
And you had a particular...

28:58.156 --> 29:04.464
Well, there was the course section, yeah, and if your date had gotten early, she'd have a seat for you.

29:04.484 --> 29:08.149
Yeah, there was nothing particular I remember about anything other than that.

29:08.970 --> 29:10.072
You went to Yale practices?

29:10.192 --> 29:12.255
Oh, I obviously went to Yale practice, midnight Yale practice.

29:12.595 --> 29:14.137
And they were midnight then.

29:14.157 --> 29:15.239
And they were midnight then.

29:15.479 --> 29:17.562
In the... In Caulfield.

29:17.582 --> 29:18.203
In Caulfield.

29:18.223 --> 29:19.905
In Caulfield.

29:19.925 --> 29:25.292
And one of the things then, and up until recently, which I thought was great, which has changed, is the band was on the field.

29:25.913 --> 29:26.053
Mm-hmm.

29:26.523 --> 29:33.611
And I don't get the same feeling at midnight y'all practice now as I did then with the band out on the field.

29:33.651 --> 29:35.593
I thought, I would love to see them bring that back.

29:36.554 --> 29:44.684
Well now, the y'all practices you attended, were they in good order and was there good, was there anything inappropriate that happened?

29:46.065 --> 29:46.946
There were good jokes.

29:49.129 --> 29:54.775
The y'all leaders could tell a lot more colorful jokes at the time than they can tell now.

29:55.615 --> 29:57.218
But they were in good order.

29:57.318 --> 29:58.440
I don't remember anybody getting out of hand.

29:58.460 --> 29:59.442
I don't remember anybody being drunk.

29:59.762 --> 30:00.303
I don't remember.

30:00.804 --> 30:03.188
And you and all of you fish went?

30:03.669 --> 30:04.311
Oh, everybody went.

30:04.331 --> 30:05.513
You went as an outfit.

30:05.633 --> 30:06.194
Oh, okay.

30:06.214 --> 30:07.376
You just, everybody went.

30:07.396 --> 30:09.360
Now, when the y'all prize was over, what'd y'all do?

30:09.380 --> 30:11.163
Did you go back to the dorm or go party?

30:12.665 --> 30:16.392
In my case, I didn't have any money to go party, so I went back to the dorm.

30:17.080 --> 30:31.598
And one of the best things talking about Midnight Yale practice was forming up outside the dorm when the band went by, you know, and then marching through the campus behind the band, which seems to have, the tradition doesn't seem to be as strong now.

30:31.618 --> 30:38.667
I mean, everybody formed up behind the band there and went through it, and that's how you went into Caulfield behind the band because you could go in under the arch

30:39.136 --> 30:41.479
in the old horseshoe.

30:41.500 --> 30:46.046
And so everybody went in that way, whereas now, by the time the band gets there, the cop feels kind of almost full.

30:46.747 --> 30:48.470
I think people miss out a lot.

30:48.490 --> 30:50.533
Then on Saturday, you had classes.

30:51.494 --> 30:52.636
No, we didn't.

30:53.437 --> 30:54.799
Oh, Saturday classes had stopped?

30:54.899 --> 30:56.181
Saturday classes had stopped.

30:56.201 --> 30:56.442
Oh, okay.

30:56.462 --> 30:57.784
Yeah, we didn't have any Saturday classes.

30:57.804 --> 30:58.004
So what?

30:58.024 --> 30:59.266
We had drill on Saturday morning.

30:59.907 --> 31:00.107
All right.

31:00.167 --> 31:00.748
On some mornings.

31:01.810 --> 31:04.454
And then... And then after drill, you were free.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.156
And...

31:06.946 --> 31:09.715
could do whatever you want to until Sunday evening.

31:10.116 --> 31:15.755
Do you remember your first football game as a student?

31:15.775 --> 31:18.002
It's an interesting story.
