00:03.220 --> 00:08.648
My sister's boy is a junior here at A&M.

00:09.729 --> 00:11.291
I mean my daughter.

00:13.354 --> 00:19.803
And he's saying something about the clay pits, but I hadn't figured out where the clay pits were yet.

00:19.823 --> 00:26.533
Apparently they were down the Wilburn Road and off in the pasture, maybe a mile or two that way and a mile or two that way.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.397
It's down around Wilburn somewhere, but I don't know.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.519
I just never did.

00:31.619 --> 00:34.003
I didn't have any money.

00:34.063 --> 00:35.665
But were there some clay?

00:36.005 --> 00:40.851
Yeah, there's a lot of people who went down there and had parties and picnics.

00:41.632 --> 00:45.718
Now how often did you and your buddies go to Bryan for anything?

00:49.182 --> 00:57.493
Well, about the only time I went to Bryan is to go to the picture show.

00:58.317 --> 01:04.426
cost you a dime to get over there on one of these taxis.

01:04.466 --> 01:19.810
They had a taxi that had come around to Tencent and then they had that old bus that stopped right across from the YMCA until it got filled and then he'd take off and go to the brine.

01:20.911 --> 01:27.261
And I never forget one day we were over there and while he was waiting for the thing to fill up he was

01:27.629 --> 01:29.932
had a barber shop under the YMCA.

01:32.356 --> 01:47.038
An old bug got at it and started that thing and took all those kids to Brown and parked it over there where it always worked.

01:49.280 --> 02:14.022
uh was there were there some places that you heard about that apparently were operating illegally i've never heard of any place that where there was a bootlegger in brazos county during that time did you ever hear of any as far as i know no well i never heard of any

02:14.508 --> 02:21.317
And I've never heard of anybody mention a house of ill repute, where there were women for sale.

02:22.098 --> 02:26.063
No, as far as I know, I never had it.

02:26.163 --> 02:39.520
I was here for four years, and I didn't.

02:40.293 --> 02:45.942
How bad did the depression affect you and your fellow students?

02:46.062 --> 02:46.903
How bad was it?

02:46.963 --> 02:47.845
Give me examples.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.173
Well, you didn't have a car.

02:55.016 --> 03:06.013
You know, the depression really started when I was about, when it really kind of affected me.

03:07.462 --> 03:14.231
Because my dad, he just worked when he could find a job.

03:15.413 --> 03:29.012
And that was in, must have been 28, 29 something, where I really could notice, where I had to have a little.

03:30.033 --> 03:34.279
And when it came to chopping cotton and picking cotton,

03:36.858 --> 03:40.001
I was there.

03:40.021 --> 03:44.727
And I'll never forget the first time I got a 14-foot sack.

03:44.747 --> 03:47.770
I really thought that was something.

03:47.790 --> 03:53.356
I don't know whether you ever know about the 14-foot sack or not.

03:53.857 --> 03:55.699
What was the pay then for picking cotton?

03:55.719 --> 03:57.280
40 cents to 100.

03:58.522 --> 04:04.148
And I'm telling you, it took a long time to pick 100 pounds.

04:06.119 --> 04:09.403
especially if he was on the other end and the wearer was on the other end.

04:10.865 --> 04:15.150
Had to pick that thing up and take it down there and weigh it.

04:15.170 --> 04:22.800
But that's a dollar a day if you're chopping cotton.

04:26.104 --> 04:32.852
And I'd say they pick you up at 7 o'clock in the morning and they'd drop you back at night

04:34.047 --> 04:36.931
after you couldn't see the rose.

04:38.352 --> 04:40.595
A long 12, 14 hour day.

04:42.057 --> 04:49.927
With money being scarce, do you remember during your student days anybody getting their money stolen?

04:51.229 --> 04:55.654
Did y'all worry about theft on the campus?

04:56.596 --> 04:57.277
On the campus?

04:58.478 --> 05:02.383
The only thing I ever remember really of

05:02.667 --> 05:10.294
One of the boys from Carson Kennan, I'll never forget, he stole a bicycle.

05:10.314 --> 05:11.015
Did he get caught?

05:11.896 --> 05:12.836
He got caught.

05:13.797 --> 05:17.761
And the students ran him off.

05:17.781 --> 05:20.123
The military had nothing to do with it.

05:20.143 --> 05:23.366
They let the students have it.

05:26.309 --> 05:31.594
And I'll never forget that.

05:34.257 --> 05:42.628
I guess the kids that came to A&M, they must have wanted an education.

05:44.851 --> 05:49.497
Describe as much as you can what a typical Aggie was in those days.

05:50.238 --> 05:57.868
What made those students special?

05:59.553 --> 06:26.022
I can't really give you a real good description other than, I guess they just got into this routine that you get up, you go to your classes, and you eat, and then you go to your classes, and then you eat, and you study.

06:27.523 --> 06:29.205
Except Wednesday afternoon.

06:29.658 --> 06:33.381
And that's when everybody had to do their marching.

06:35.223 --> 06:42.510
That was the day that they had the drill out there that afternoon.

06:42.530 --> 06:47.074
And they had some old horses over there in the field artillery.

06:49.997 --> 06:56.863
And they'd get to teach you over how to ride those things.

06:56.903 --> 06:58.905
And everybody

06:59.695 --> 07:06.382
treated their old horses a different way, you know, and they were mean.

07:07.684 --> 07:24.842
And some of the mornings you'd get up and dress and go down there and ride those horses and then you had to come back and then dress again to go to class and it's that ten minute

07:25.210 --> 07:26.031
periods you know.

07:26.372 --> 07:29.276
I don't know how much they got in an hour for change.

07:29.296 --> 07:29.817
Half hour.

07:29.837 --> 07:31.339
Half hour to change classes.

07:32.380 --> 07:33.502
We just had ten minutes.

07:37.167 --> 07:39.992
But I don't know.

07:42.816 --> 07:53.952
It just seemed to me like now I had this good friend that went to North Texas and he's telling me what all they did and you know it was completely different.

07:54.725 --> 08:03.961
Now, did it matter in your days at A&M whether you were a country boy or a city boy?

08:04.602 --> 08:05.664
Well, I guess they knew it.

08:08.508 --> 08:17.644
The only thing they really knew when you was a freshman, you had that strap around your arm, I mean around your cup, that white strap.

08:18.704 --> 08:26.671
Now, how soon after you arrived did you have to start learn the Aggie routine of whipping up?

08:26.691 --> 08:29.333
It didn't take you long.

08:29.353 --> 08:40.843
Did you ever get whacked with a... I've had my honey as black as your shoes.

08:40.863 --> 08:48.390
I mean, from a coat hanger to one of those old paddles and

08:50.007 --> 09:12.336
did did y'all when you were a fish did y'all ever pay a sophomore back did you ever as far as I know I never did let's see did uh what about the steam tunnels did you did you ever get down in no I didn't I heard about some of those kids getting in down there but

09:12.890 --> 09:14.672
I never did get in there.

09:14.692 --> 09:16.413
Let's see, back to student attitudes.

09:17.714 --> 09:27.282
Were you aware that there was a wide variety of students in terms of where, what, whether they were Baptist or Methodist or Catholic, did that matter?

09:28.263 --> 09:37.391
Didn't to me because most of the churches that we had then, either the Baptist or the Methodist right up there at Northgate.

09:38.692 --> 09:42.475
And I think there's another church up there, but I was a Methodist and I,

09:43.130 --> 09:51.741
I went mostly at around 10 o'clock Sunday morning.

09:51.761 --> 09:57.970
They had two services, I think, 9 or 10, and then 11 to 12.

09:58.370 --> 10:02.656
Were there some Hispanic boys at A&M then, Mexican-American?

10:03.777 --> 10:04.098
Yes.

10:05.119 --> 10:11.027
In fact, one of them I hated the most was from Mexico.

10:13.488 --> 10:19.496
He'd get out there at the door and holler, freshman, and hear all the freshmen running down there.

10:20.518 --> 10:22.741
He'd open the door and say, what y'all want?

10:22.761 --> 10:23.822
He said, I didn't call.

10:24.343 --> 10:24.523
Uh-oh.

10:26.566 --> 10:32.094
But that's the only one in our outfit, and that was when I was a freshman.

10:32.835 --> 10:38.082
Were there any Jewish students then?

10:38.703 --> 10:39.664
I'm sure there were.

10:45.517 --> 10:48.942
Did students have nicknames for each other then?

10:49.002 --> 10:54.529
Well, then the freshmen didn't just fix them.

10:54.670 --> 10:55.110
Okay.

10:56.172 --> 10:58.495
Other than that, no, I don't remember any.

11:01.059 --> 11:01.499
Let's see.

11:02.220 --> 11:07.187
As you listened to that radio that you said you brought with you,

11:16.415 --> 11:21.821
As you listen to the radio, did the events in the world begin to concern you?

11:22.962 --> 11:26.927
Were you all worried much about Hitler and what was happening in Europe?

11:31.772 --> 11:33.534
As far as I know, it didn't to me.

11:34.395 --> 11:43.806
But when I got out and they sent me to Waco,

11:45.845 --> 11:53.533
And I signed up then, and then that was in 39.

11:53.553 --> 11:56.455
Then it started.

11:58.157 --> 12:03.923
But no, as far as I know, I know one thing.

12:04.303 --> 12:13.472
They did pull a few out while they were here.

12:16.692 --> 12:19.556
And they'd have to replace them.

12:19.576 --> 12:22.300
The younger ones.

12:25.024 --> 12:25.404
Let's see.

12:26.486 --> 12:27.908
What was Final Review like?

12:29.470 --> 12:30.371
Well, it was sad.

12:36.299 --> 12:37.301
You'd get out there.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.710
Had those wool clothes on.

12:45.051 --> 12:46.193
You were marching.

12:47.455 --> 12:52.402
And it was about 11 o'clock in the morning.

12:52.422 --> 12:53.945
It was tough.

12:53.965 --> 13:03.298
Lots of them, I saw a lot of them drop out, faint.

13:03.318 --> 13:08.546
But after my sophomore year, I never did any of that.

13:09.067 --> 13:11.410
You know, I didn't have to do it.

13:14.174 --> 13:15.336
But it's...

13:16.480 --> 13:32.166
And, you know, say to my mom, shake hands, go through all your group that you'd been with for four years, and shake hands.

13:32.707 --> 13:35.331
It was a sad situation.

13:38.316 --> 13:43.264
And some of them that I've never seen again.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.049
About how many graduated when you did?

13:53.096 --> 13:59.825
Seemed to me, I was, I would say in around the 400.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.450
Do you remember how many started out?

14:04.471 --> 14:07.075
Yeah, I think it was around 1,400 something.

14:07.095 --> 14:08.697
1,400 freshmen?

14:09.759 --> 14:09.899
Uh-huh.

14:09.919 --> 14:12.062
And about 400, you think, graduated.

14:12.663 --> 14:14.365
And we graduated...

14:16.403 --> 14:21.649
in the old U over at Cobb Hill.

14:24.231 --> 14:28.576
Mama was asking some of them where they graduated, and they didn't even know where they graduated.

14:28.596 --> 14:36.484
They built a little platform out there, and her daddy shook my hand.

14:37.645 --> 14:40.969
What kind of world did you think you were going out into?

14:42.010 --> 14:43.011
I had no more.

14:43.031 --> 14:44.773
I knew it couldn't have been.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.854
any worse than some before I ever got to A&M.

14:50.635 --> 14:56.883
And you have no idea how poor we were.

14:57.705 --> 15:04.034
How far had you traveled before commencement?

15:04.054 --> 15:05.135
Where had you been to?

15:08.420 --> 15:14.448
Well, you mean out of Texas?

15:14.468 --> 15:14.929
I hadn't.

15:15.922 --> 15:17.463
You had never been out of Texas?

15:17.523 --> 15:19.405
Never been out of Texas right there.

15:19.425 --> 15:24.430
Well, I went across, swim across the Red River in Oklahoma.

15:24.630 --> 15:28.093
And I said, boy, we've been in Oklahoma.

15:28.113 --> 15:29.174
That's the farthest I ever.

15:29.675 --> 15:31.536
And where in Texas had you been?

15:31.576 --> 15:43.127
The farthest I had been away from Texas, in Texas, was when I won the district track.

15:43.147 --> 15:44.308
And went to Austin?

15:45.284 --> 16:04.100
And I got down there, and the old boy, our track coach, was a University of Texas graduate, and they put us in one of their fraternity houses that night.

16:05.622 --> 16:15.190
I got up the next morning, he took us over there, getting ready to run a certain race, and

16:16.081 --> 16:19.727
And some of those old boys had fancy uniforms on, you know.

16:20.548 --> 16:24.674
And I had that old dull gray uniform that was still dirty.

16:25.736 --> 16:29.221
And I just, I told them, where'd you get?

16:29.962 --> 16:33.508
I said, I saw some of their steel cleats.

16:34.109 --> 16:40.098
And I was still in the box.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.021
That was just how.

16:45.798 --> 16:52.067
I guess how ignorant I was or ignorant I hadn't been anywhere.

16:52.748 --> 16:56.072
And you had ridden on a train a few times.

16:56.834 --> 17:02.482
Well, on a train coming to A&M, yeah.

17:02.502 --> 17:03.883
4.49 that morning.

17:04.084 --> 17:09.752
That Monday morning I got over there.

17:09.772 --> 17:12.075
Compare your feelings...

17:12.950 --> 17:20.283
the day you arrived with the day you left to go to work for four years later?

17:23.028 --> 17:26.994
I just, I had no idea.

17:27.135 --> 17:28.517
I really didn't.

17:28.537 --> 17:35.950
I just, I was, I knew I had to do something.

17:35.970 --> 17:37.152
And I had a job.

17:38.633 --> 17:45.583
And that's what I went to A&M to get a job.

17:45.883 --> 17:48.727
Was there ever a time when you thought about dropping out?

17:49.548 --> 17:49.928
A&M?

17:50.309 --> 17:50.609
Yes, sir.

17:51.330 --> 17:51.451
Ooh.

17:57.058 --> 18:07.172
Quiz A. I had a first quiz in chemistry.

18:08.637 --> 18:12.202
And I came, and I got it back, and I had a 39 on it.

18:13.364 --> 18:15.687
I called this girl up in Denton.

18:15.707 --> 18:18.451
I said, I don't guess I'll be here long.

18:20.654 --> 18:32.352
She said, well, I made a 39 on my quiz A. She said, you better get in there and start studying, because I'll never speak to you again.

18:33.734 --> 18:34.535
And you know what?

18:35.256 --> 18:36.838
That girl's been married twice.

18:37.392 --> 18:40.199
And we still talk each other every so often.

18:40.220 --> 18:40.581
Oh good.

18:41.503 --> 18:52.051
She will have a birthday on July the 9th and I'll call her.

18:52.091 --> 18:53.916
She'll call me on my birthday.

18:54.672 --> 18:57.856
On March 16th, and we still... That's good.

18:58.497 --> 19:00.579
Sure does.

19:00.900 --> 19:07.248
Were there some other times when an advisor or a counselor here was very helpful to you?

19:07.688 --> 19:11.393
I never had a counselor to talk to me.

19:11.513 --> 19:12.214
I really didn't.

19:12.775 --> 19:15.979
And I guess if I'd been smart, I would have gotten one.

19:17.160 --> 19:20.224
But they cost money.

19:21.385 --> 19:22.987
And I didn't have it.

19:23.247 --> 19:23.468
Right.

19:23.588 --> 19:33.040
As you look back, are there some teachers that were really important to helping you that you feel grateful to?

19:33.080 --> 19:34.722
Well, yeah.

19:35.603 --> 19:37.085
Celeste was one of them.

19:37.105 --> 19:40.228
But that's after I got my junior and senior.

19:41.670 --> 19:46.296
I had one course over there marketing.

19:47.913 --> 19:50.257
Marketing has seen me like it's 319.

19:50.517 --> 19:53.482
I'm not going to 301 or 303.

19:54.643 --> 20:05.300
And we had a new professor came in here and just graduated.

20:05.320 --> 20:16.317
And I took that course and it was September.

20:17.275 --> 20:19.819
I took notes.

20:19.839 --> 20:21.422
I didn't have any money to buy books.

20:21.522 --> 20:23.184
I just had to borrow notebooks.

20:23.244 --> 20:35.003
I just never could do anything with that guy and came up with then a D. A D was failing then.

20:35.564 --> 20:42.034
Now it's not failing, I don't think.

20:43.718 --> 21:02.740
the end of the second half of my senior year, I said, I've got to take that again, and I've got to pull that thing up to get a lease to see.

21:03.833 --> 21:17.307
Went in there to take that test and old Skipper Salesman walked down the hall and he looked in there and said, then you didn't have to take finals if you didn't want to.

21:19.349 --> 21:21.171
He said, what are you doing there taking finals?

21:21.191 --> 21:23.193
I told him what I knew about.

21:25.716 --> 21:31.782
You had to have a point for every hour.

21:33.820 --> 21:39.266
And he says, well, I'll tell you what I'll do.

21:40.847 --> 22:03.490
You got a B in my course and I'll just raise yours to an A. And so, when I finally got my exams, I had three A's and two B's and that C. So, from a B to an A hit me and then I got a C in that

22:04.263 --> 22:08.007
314, I believe is the name of that market.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.731
But they never used them anymore.

22:14.194 --> 22:18.338
If you needed advice about something important, who did you go to?

22:18.438 --> 22:19.119
I went to him.

22:19.359 --> 22:21.542
To Skipper Schleselman?

22:21.562 --> 22:29.130
A lot of the time I went to him and he kind of figured out my deal.

22:30.091 --> 22:31.232
He just knew...

22:31.685 --> 22:34.148
I was a lost cause.

22:34.729 --> 22:35.890
I guess he'd call it.

22:36.951 --> 22:38.814
But we made it.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.419
Wonderful.

22:43.439 --> 22:52.190
And let's see, one of the others.

22:53.131 --> 22:55.674
I had a course in apriculture.

22:55.734 --> 22:57.216
You know what apriculture is?

22:57.796 --> 22:59.278
I had a course under the doctor.

23:00.642 --> 23:02.924
Oh hell, I know his name as good as a dude.

23:03.745 --> 23:08.871
Because we got an Ive out there, about 40 foot up there.

23:09.331 --> 23:12.274
Huge colony of bees.

23:17.800 --> 23:24.708
And so I talked to him a lot.

23:24.728 --> 23:26.970
But I made it.

23:28.267 --> 23:38.099
Are there if we could line up all the other people that you knew at a&m in those days if we had them all here Are there any others you'd want to thank?

23:39.521 --> 23:57.042
If they were all still here Oh No, I don't know of any any others

23:58.456 --> 23:59.477
All right, sir, let's see.

23:59.557 --> 24:03.861
Did you go to muster while you were a student, Aggie muster?

24:05.222 --> 24:05.723
This year?

24:06.043 --> 24:08.125
No, no, back when you were a student.

24:08.145 --> 24:09.727
No, I sure didn't.

24:09.747 --> 24:12.069
All right, what about your Aggie ring?

24:13.490 --> 24:15.352
When did you buy it, and how much did it cost?

24:17.434 --> 24:21.478
This ring, this is not the first one.

24:21.518 --> 24:24.180
This is the second or third.

24:24.741 --> 24:26.843
The first one cost $29.95.

24:29.624 --> 24:36.394
And a customer that I waited on all the time in the Aggie Land and bought it for me.

24:37.075 --> 24:37.436
Really?

24:37.936 --> 24:38.457
Sure did.

24:38.737 --> 24:39.499
So it was a gift?

24:39.859 --> 24:40.540
It was a gift.

24:41.902 --> 24:44.867
And how did you feel when you first put it on?

24:45.187 --> 24:51.717
Oh, I guess just like these kids now, just in another world.

24:53.179 --> 24:55.362
I never thought it would ever happen, but...

24:56.118 --> 24:59.163
Do you have any Aggie ring stories?

24:59.263 --> 25:01.226
Did you ever lose it?

25:01.366 --> 25:02.608
No, I never did.

25:03.249 --> 25:06.835
You know, there have been some good ones where lost and so forth.

25:07.235 --> 25:11.182
In fact, I'm sure in the war there were a lot of good ones.

25:13.786 --> 25:16.330
What is it that creates Aggie spirit?

25:21.618 --> 25:23.020
You know, that's a good question.

25:24.772 --> 25:35.984
Unless you just see some of them every day, seven days a week.

25:36.004 --> 25:43.371
And I guess if you needed anything at all, they'd help you.

25:43.391 --> 25:54.643
I've never been in a case where I had to ask for an Aggie help.

25:56.294 --> 26:05.267
But I'm sure that if I had, I would have gotten it.

26:10.815 --> 26:15.882
Do you remember during your student days beginning to feel that there was a special spirit here?

26:18.146 --> 26:19.548
Never thought much about it, really.

26:20.709 --> 26:25.997
You were just here among them all, and all the...

26:26.737 --> 26:28.139
seven days a week, you know.

26:29.781 --> 26:34.728
Especially back there then, because we didn't have that many students.

26:38.914 --> 26:41.898
Now, I don't know, 40 some odd thousand, I don't know.

26:41.918 --> 26:50.870
When you have 4,000 and 43,000, there's a whole lot of difference.

26:51.050 --> 26:55.917
As you look back, what difference did it make in your life that you attended A&M?

26:57.871 --> 26:59.012
Oh, I don't know.

26:59.212 --> 27:00.634
I'm just happy I did.

27:02.075 --> 27:24.237
And I'm sure if I could—I told my wife here one time, I said, if Mama can just see me, I know that she'd be proud because none of her kids did anything but me.

27:25.658 --> 27:26.359
And why?

27:27.115 --> 27:31.662
I didn't have any push.

27:31.682 --> 27:35.287
And why I came to A&M, I'll never know.

27:35.347 --> 27:45.723
And I met lots and lots, and as you know, you've done the same thing.

27:46.624 --> 27:50.150
Lots and lots of people here have been good.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.738
All right, now you had a lot of determination when you got here.

27:56.495 --> 27:58.158
Did A&M increase that?

27:58.939 --> 27:59.700
I think so.

28:01.062 --> 28:07.893
Just watching other students have a whole lot to do with the way you.

28:09.276 --> 28:18.330
And I think that's the same way with you getting back to what we were talking about a while ago stealing or misrepresenting a certain thing.

28:19.993 --> 28:22.637
That it wasn't done, so why should I do it?

28:27.477 --> 28:39.768
As you look on your life since then, was there anything that A&M failed to do for you that you wish it had?

28:39.788 --> 28:41.789
Not that I know of.

28:42.650 --> 28:56.742
Here, three or four years ago, a man called me and wanted to appoint me

28:57.565 --> 29:20.239
to be one of the... What do you call it?

29:20.259 --> 29:25.227
Excuse me, I just... Just...

29:27.721 --> 29:30.444
Can I move this just a little?

29:30.464 --> 29:31.325
Do we need to unplug it?

29:32.086 --> 29:35.370
No.

29:35.390 --> 29:44.901
A letterman wanted me to point me on the Letterman's Association.

29:44.921 --> 29:47.324
And I said, well, why me?

29:48.745 --> 29:55.433
And oh, hell, I could talk forever about what I've done for the Hathaway Lake Department.

29:56.611 --> 30:03.378
But you'd not think I'd been bragging, but anyway, I can brag about it.

30:04.519 --> 30:06.080
And I said, yeah, and they did.

30:06.120 --> 30:13.247
They presented me this thing right up there, which is really something.

30:13.267 --> 30:14.268
How good.

30:14.288 --> 30:14.969
It really was.

30:19.233 --> 30:19.713
Let's see.

30:19.913 --> 30:20.814
The last question then.

30:23.157 --> 30:25.639
What feelings do you carry in your heart

30:26.210 --> 30:28.674
for Texas A&M today?

30:29.615 --> 30:34.242
Oh, I just wouldn't have.

30:34.262 --> 30:37.187
I would never have been here if it hadn't been for Texas A&M.

30:40.212 --> 30:45.840
It's meant everything to me, and it gave me what I got for 60.

30:46.001 --> 30:51.509
We've been married 60 years on the 27th of April.

30:52.631 --> 30:54.073
And as I was telling you a while ago,

30:55.302 --> 31:25.309
or before all this started, that we eat up the cafeteria at least five days a week, and that one certain day, the 27th, we went in up there about 10 to 45 or 11, and there was a huge bouquet of flowers and a big

31:26.285 --> 31:29.962
cake decorated with six chips in her.

31:30.043 --> 31:30.709
And that was,
