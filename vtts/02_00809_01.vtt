00:17.868 --> 00:35.856
1983 for the history of College Station Project at 
Colonel

00:17.868 --> 00:35.856
Anderson's house. It was Texas' first effort to 
assist in the educational process. This is the

00:45.931 --> 00:55.922
oldest state school and the only state school at 
its inception.

00:55.942 --> 01:02.810
Nothing which is on the campus now was here, of 
course, at that time. It was just simply open ranch

01:02.890 --> 01:12.201
or farm land.

01:12.221 --> 01:14.183
The school, of course, had had a very limited group 
of buildings to house a student body and a meager

01:15.091 --> 01:44.963
core of teachers to instruct them.

01:47.660 --> 01:53.148
have no idea how primitive it was in those days. 
College Station was nothing. It was simply the

01:55.932 --> 01:58.937
beginnings of A&M College. All of the people who 
were here at the beginning served the college in

02:00.138 --> 02:09.632
some capacity. They either were teachers or 
administrators.

02:15.689 --> 02:21.755
And there weren't many teachers or 
administrators or students as far as that's

02:15.689 --> 02:21.755
concerned. But they

02:23.978 --> 02:42.557
were off to a good start, and that is the beginning 
of the city of College Station.

02:43.820 --> 02:47.244
There was no Highway 6 at that time. There was no 
southern

02:49.826 --> 03:12.730
limit to the campus, which was then a barbed

02:49.826 --> 03:12.730
wire fence, which is now Jersey Street. The 
college grew and a few people, mostly a colored

03:15.258 --> 03:35.730
group,

03:15.258 --> 03:35.730
constructed a few houses which is on Fireview 
Street.

03:41.735 --> 04:06.662
They served the college in

03:41.735 --> 04:06.662
servant capacity, as all of the professors lived 
on the campus,

03:41.735 --> 04:06.662
in campus-owned houses.

04:12.177 --> 04:30.739
We had two railroads

04:12.177 --> 04:30.739
and one

04:12.177 --> 04:30.739
road which went north and south and none that went 
east and west.

04:33.423 --> 04:40.311
This continued as the city grew and the park which 
is now south of the campus,

04:40.578 --> 05:07.513
began to

04:40.578 --> 05:07.513
attract people who were hangers-on or who were 
professors

04:40.578 --> 05:07.513
in the increasingly in increasing need for such 
people. They started,

05:15.955 --> 05:37.602
when the space on the campus for campus teachers 
played out, people began to build homes down in the

05:15.955 --> 05:37.602
place called College Park.

05:42.560 --> 05:52.657
until this took place, the whole, that was 
excellent quail hunting area. And the

05:54.200 --> 06:07.943
road to our east, to this lane that went to the 
sulfur spines,

06:13.171 --> 06:31.014
That area was used by the early farming

06:13.171 --> 06:31.014
sections of the college as experiment

06:13.171 --> 06:31.014
stations later on. I can recall some excellent 
dove shooting there. I could go out and get my limit

06:37.863 --> 06:42.148
of doves before 8 o'clock in the morning. This is 
where City Hall is now? This is between here and the

06:46.341 --> 06:48.904
east. City Hall? Where City Hall is? City Hall? The 
City Hall? Where it is presently? The City Hall...

07:09.181 --> 07:12.304
The first City Hall was...

07:15.389 --> 07:25.299
at the present north, near the present north gate, 
in a home over Joe Soslick's studio. We had one

07:26.160 --> 07:39.034
room, one girl, one policeman,

07:26.160 --> 07:39.034
and

07:43.975 --> 07:46.819
And no bonded indebtedness. That's wonderful.

07:52.246 --> 08:12.953
In regard to the no bonded indebtedness,

07:52.246 --> 08:12.953
when we needed something, we just asked the people 
to pay their part. Now, for instance, we had no

08:13.490 --> 08:17.897
water. We had no sewer system. Everybody had these 
underground

08:20.821 --> 08:31.318
septic tanks.

08:33.361 --> 08:38.629
We had no metered water distribution system. 
Everybody paid the same price. Later on, when we

08:42.802 --> 08:54.660
decided that we should have meters, we didn't 
think of borrowing money and buying them and

08:42.802 --> 08:54.660
putting them in. We just asked the people to pay for 
them. So everybody paid for their own meter, and

08:57.384 --> 09:04.434
that's the way we operated in those days. We didn't 
have any bondage indebtedness. As the city grew,

09:11.017 --> 09:16.123
which it did south and then to the east. It was 
because of developers doing the building and

09:16.143 --> 09:22.811
installing the utilities.

09:25.694 --> 09:40.551
The city bought these installations and paid for 
them in the fees which they collected by their use.

09:40.953 --> 09:46.000
Let's go back a little bit to the beginnings again.

09:52.228 --> 09:56.153
We had very few students, very few of anything. The 
facilities were few and limited. But we did have

10:07.733 --> 10:19.027
installations like the horse barn, and that is 
where the system building is at the head of Walton

10:07.733 --> 10:19.027
Street. We had Hog Barn, which is where the golf 
shop is.

10:28.900 --> 10:35.108
And the

10:28.900 --> 10:35.108
people that ran the around the hog barn were 
bothered about their hogs having cholera, and so

10:35.763 --> 10:53.563
they encouraged old Oxbreg and me to come over 
there with our shotguns and shoot the pigeons. And

10:54.784 --> 11:02.513
so that added, that was

10:54.784 --> 11:02.513
quite a quite an attraction for we two old hunter 
type people. Now

11:11.974 --> 11:24.400
you might bring that about where we shot the doves 
when the seeds fell out of the

11:32.480 --> 11:36.105
No, I didn't want to duplicate stuff. Oh, no, 
that's quite all right. So, the flesh,

11:39.730 --> 11:47.981
how much of it is there? That's the firstborn and 
the hog. Yes, both

11:50.865 --> 11:59.137
of them. We had a football team and And we had, I 
suppose, maybe one or two other types of

12:01.910 --> 12:12.607
activities. But we didn't have much stadium. They 
started off, of course, standing up on the

12:15.251 --> 12:21.281
sidelines like they did everywhere else. And then 
we built a stadium.

12:33.871 --> 12:52.961
and we picked that stadium up at the end of the 
football season and we carted it over to just east

12:33.871 --> 12:52.961
of the Fred's swimming pool where home base was for 
the baseball team. And around the baseball field

12:53.122 --> 12:57.769
was

13:01.327 --> 13:10.720
place where we had a straightaway on that track was 
between home base and third base. And then it went

13:10.740 --> 13:26.541
on in that direction, which paralleled the 220 
yard section of the track, went on parallel to the

13:10.740 --> 13:26.541
Joe Routt Bush, the red start.

13:32.393 --> 13:41.505
And that gives you an idea of how primitive things 
were around here

13:32.393 --> 13:41.505
in the United States. Now, after a

13:41.525 --> 13:55.903
good many years, then the one street, which was 
Fairview Street,

14:28.739 --> 14:42.717
All

14:28.739 --> 14:42.717
these roads, there was very little need for 
east-west intersections, for east-west roads.

14:42.737 --> 14:52.850
People had, after we got years and years after the 
beginnings around here, we had some schools over

14:42.737 --> 14:52.850
to our east. Everybody had to come up to New Jersey 
to go east or west. And there were a few roads, but

15:01.903 --> 15:13.376
none of them went east or west of more than one or two 
blocks, and then they'd stop. There wasn't a

15:13.396 --> 15:26.792
single one that the kids could go to school at Old 
Consolidated without coming up to Jersey and

15:13.396 --> 15:26.792
going there to get to Consolidated.

15:43.647 --> 15:57.790
He gave us a street from all the way from the Weldon 
Road to the school system. He had to go across one

15:57.810 --> 16:05.864
barbed wire fence between Timber and Lee Street. 
There's a barbed wire fence that went

16:16.773 --> 16:24.800
in those days, he gave those lots to the city. And 
that was one of the finest and the biggest gifts

16:24.820 --> 16:33.308
that anybody ever gave the city of College 
Station. For a street? For a street. He gave us, at

16:36.191 --> 16:44.518
one time, he gave us enough vacant lots

16:46.203 --> 16:54.835
from the Weldon Road clear through to Timber 
Street. Do you know what street? So we, Timber. It

16:58.600 --> 17:08.574
is post, it is, uh,

16:58.600 --> 17:08.574
oh, I already, I'm slow on my mind.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.379
It is, uh,

17:18.502 --> 17:20.564
It has a little park down here.

17:35.661 --> 17:37.002
Parkway. Parkway? Parkway. Okay. He gave us a 
parkway so that the people would go east.

17:47.864 --> 17:49.847
That was good. I want to recommend to the present 
city council that they name our street for a

17:49.867 --> 17:57.900
personal purchase. I'll have to tell them that, 
but that's a good idea. You get that in there.

18:02.488 --> 18:03.409
That's a good idea.

18:20.922 --> 18:27.630
find some street somewhere and call it Burgess, 
the Burgess Street. That's in my book. Now,

18:32.676 --> 18:49.377
and by the way, Herschel Burgess owned that one 
room where the city council was meeting. We rented

18:50.977 --> 18:55.198
that one room from .

19:31.375 --> 20:00.781
I wanted

19:31.375 --> 20:00.781
to

19:31.375 --> 20:00.781
ask some information about your background. 
Where were you born?

20:09.530 --> 20:15.176
I trimmed the top of that tree out there. I had a 
brush file out there. I can't show you here. But I

20:19.341 --> 20:32.816
cut a whole bunch of poison ivy out of my son's

20:19.341 --> 20:32.816
pile. Oh, I shouldn't be talking. He lives in 
Brown, and we live in College Station.

20:41.947 --> 20:44.550
between the two places. And did you do this 
recently? Did you cut the trees recently? Huh? Did

20:49.635 --> 20:51.117
you do this recently? Oh, I did. Some of it 
yesterday.

20:55.942 --> 20:56.743
Oh, my heavens. My running gear has been in there 
for a while. I don't know about my motor, and I don't

20:59.646 --> 21:06.254
know about some of the other functions, but as far 
as my muscle and bone, they're all right. Oh,

21:06.514 --> 21:07.515
that's great. Were your parents from Tennessee 
also? Who? Your parents? I was born in Sparta,

21:13.392 --> 21:15.375
Tennessee. And were your parents from Tennessee? 
Well, my parents came over here in 1780.

21:25.807 --> 21:31.254
I go back with five different families to the 
Revolution. That's wonderful. They all came to

21:34.618 --> 21:38.682
Tennessee as they migrated. From? From the east, 
the Alliganders crossed over into west

21:39.997 --> 21:55.154
Tennessee, east Tennessee, and then they came all 
across the Cumberlands to the middle Tennessee

21:39.997 --> 21:55.154
and started from just this, just barely in the 
middle Tennessee.

21:58.698 --> 21:59.960
Prettiest country in the world. Oh, waterfalls 
there, oh, they'd be so, so, so nice. Maybe just

22:05.045 --> 22:09.210
such a fine place to live. It freezes every night 
and thaws every morning. That's not nice. But the

22:17.445 --> 22:21.670
people there, they figured that if they lived 
through March, they got it made. What did your

22:24.012 --> 22:25.493
parents do? Oh, my grandfather was a miller, and my 
great-grandfather was a miller and a lawyer.

22:39.970 --> 22:52.490
They, of course, Sparta had one raid by the 
northern cavalry, but they didn't do any damage to

22:39.970 --> 22:52.490
the place. They burned a lot of stuff north of the 
town there.

22:59.721 --> 23:05.590
But they didn't bother to run down his mill, but 
they didn't go out and go to the west of it.

23:09.907 --> 23:15.514
My grandparents didn't like the Yankees. They 
didn't like the Yankees. He had slaves.

23:23.565 --> 23:27.950
My son over here has a fireplace. A lot of the bricks 
in the face of that fireplace were molded by those

23:29.172 --> 23:36.201
slaves of William Anderson.

23:44.247 --> 23:47.150
Oh, I've got plenty. I can't talk too much about me, 
because this is about sitting on the station. So

23:54.796 --> 24:01.562
what other things would you like? Well, I'll tell 
you one reason. I told them, I don't like

24:04.004 --> 24:08.768
politicians. I just simply don't like 
politicians, because they're not good citizens,

24:08.789 --> 24:13.933
mostly. Because they spend your and my money in 
order to get re-elected. They waste our money to

24:19.612 --> 24:21.896
get re-elected. All of this stuff going on in 
Washington is this interest and that interest and

24:22.096 --> 24:34.715
that interest has its lobbyists to go in there and 
buy these people off. They'll say, you'll never be

24:34.735 --> 24:38.941
re-elected unless you support me. And we got 
Graham, who's a grand, grand boy. And he's He's

24:44.052 --> 24:49.059
whipping some of these people a little bit. But I 
just don't like, I don't like a democracy. But

24:54.426 --> 24:56.209
it's, I wouldn't give it up. It's the best we have. 
It gives us liberty. But it also gives us liberty to

25:00.976 --> 25:04.240
almost shoot somebody. We can do nearly anything. 
It gives us the liberty to starve or steal. And we

25:10.989 --> 25:13.553
can't keep the people from starving. Now, way back 
in the early Greeks, there was a very fine old

25:14.866 --> 25:34.751
philosopher who said, our democracy is a 
wasteful,

25:14.866 --> 25:34.751
inefficient type of government. You can't get 
anything done if the politicians mess it up. Now,

25:41.499 --> 25:44.603
that happened a long time ago. Now, they're still 
doing the same thing, but we can't give it up

25:45.224 --> 25:58.177
because we can do... Over in Russia, they say, 
here, you used to be a serf. They won't tell it in

25:58.198 --> 25:59.559
this. And you used to feel like you had it in for 
these people up here, all these rich folks. All

26:08.648 --> 26:10.110
right, you rebelled. And they shot the rich folks 
that you were working for But they put a hole in your

26:16.038 --> 26:21.926
hand, and you said, boy, you're going to hole. And 
they go over here to this factory, and they give you

26:23.128 --> 26:34.904
a card and say, you're working in this factory, and 
that's where you're going to work, bud, and you're

26:23.128 --> 26:34.904
not going to strike either. Now, history repeats 
itself. We're headed for the same thing. If we

26:42.053 --> 26:44.897
don't get strong, Russia will take us over. And 
then there'll be more poor folks than there are

26:45.333 --> 26:53.961
rich folks, and they'll get rid of the rich folks. 
And the poor folks will wake up as slaves of the army

26:53.981 --> 27:04.671
and of the people that are running things in 
Russia. They're coming right on after us. They've

27:06.433 --> 27:10.957
come already in Cuba, and they're coming out of 
South America. And they're spending $3 or $4 to one

27:10.977 --> 27:14.040
for us. They get ready to dictate a peace to us. They 
say, will you surrender or shall we pauperize?

27:22.986 --> 27:25.310
You were in World War I, is that right? You were in 
World War I? And II. I was in both of them. Okay. I

27:32.179 --> 27:38.087
left the mayor's job to go into the Army, but I 
wasn't going to run again. Oh, really? I was not

27:39.249 --> 27:43.875
going to run again because I promised them I would 
serve one term. And then I would not retreat myself

27:44.750 --> 27:58.649
because

27:44.750 --> 27:58.649
they won't like me because I will not buy their 
water meter. And I will expect them to do their

27:59.611 --> 28:02.956
part. And people don't like that. They like to do it 
for them. They'd rather you borrow the money. And

28:11.708 --> 28:14.031
I'm just that type. And I knew, oh, I might have been 
re-elected. I don't know. Because after all,

28:20.691 --> 28:26.367
there are more people who believe like me than 
believe otherwise, I think. But I don't know about

28:26.387 --> 28:29.235
that now. Well, at least I told them I'll serve one 
term, just like you're supposed to serve on the

28:30.667 --> 28:37.254
jury once at least. And then, by golly, you don't 
have to anymore. If you're a good citizen, you'll

28:41.958 --> 28:45.281
do what you're asking for your part. But people 
might not want me, because they may not want to buy

28:45.922 --> 28:53.530
that water meter. Now I'm just using that as a .. But 
when I was mayor, I shot skunks. I shot mad dogs. I

28:59.320 --> 29:07.813
did everything that a police department and 
everything else had to do. And I enjoyed it. I was a

29:09.957 --> 29:16.427
coach, you see, which I didn't have anything else 
pressing on me. If I'd have been the athletic

29:16.907 --> 29:21.354
director or the head football coach, it may have 
been different. But I was a freshman coach, and I

29:34.117 --> 29:43.046
until I retired and I was here from 1920 through 57 
and never was fired and never did quit. And they

29:44.007 --> 29:46.470
named the truck for me. Is that right? It's Frank 
Anderson's truck? That's wonderful. Let me show

29:51.975 --> 29:57.661
you something here. It might be well for me to talk 
when I shouldn't be listening, but I rather enjoy

30:03.074 --> 30:18.737
the fact that I did something at A&M College to help

30:03.074 --> 30:18.737
it grow. I'd

30:18.757 --> 30:32.136
been here for about 20 years when Dr. Walton, the 
college president, asked me to take the

30:18.757 --> 30:32.136
commandant's job. Well, he probably regretted 
that because I pitched a hot potato in his lap. I was

30:43.155 --> 30:46.318
a tough commandant. This place needed somebody to 
start the ball rolling in another new direction.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.189
It needed to grow. When I came out here, they had 
1,700 students, a freshman found himself in a

31:04.094 --> 31:08.841
company of 35 people.

31:10.784 --> 31:21.299
At the end of that year, some of those companies 
didn't have half of them. They just ran the

31:21.319 --> 31:26.727
freshmen off by tough hazing. And as a track coach, 
I had a pretty hard time keep getting a good track

31:31.465 --> 31:33.487
man to come here. If I got one to come here, they 
wouldn't respect him. They'd respect a freshman

31:36.551 --> 31:42.318
football man, but they wouldn't respect a 
freshman track man. And these boys, maybe the one

31:42.398 --> 31:48.165
of them are at home, well, they thought they were 
pretty good stuff. And they come here, and some

31:48.185 --> 31:59.599
good-for-nothing sophomore will beat his rear 
and have him to serve them, make their bed up,

31:48.185 --> 31:59.599
seniors and juniors and whatnot. And that was 
keeping this school from growing. But I was tough.

32:08.122 --> 32:09.164
I was pretty tough. And I did a lot of things, among 
which was start a new tradition. I can claim one

32:16.274 --> 32:20.640
tradition, a legal bonfire. The student body used 
everything that was loose and some of the things

32:24.655 --> 32:33.833
that weren't, like the faculty's wood pile or 
their garden gate. And all of the outside houses

32:34.935 --> 32:47.659
and the other people's backyard, they delighted 
on bringing those off as a unit.

32:50.137 --> 33:03.995
All right, now my first, after the bonfire in 1935, 
I'm now the

32:50.137 --> 33:03.995
brand new young little commandant. And a very 
irate farmer came into my office and said those

33:04.015 --> 33:15.790
damn SOBs ran off of my barn last night, log barn, 
and put it on the bonfire.

33:19.043 --> 33:22.328
And so I just get the captains in and I say, well, all 
right. That's the last bonfire you're gonna

33:23.430 --> 33:26.754
build. I'm gonna build the next bonfire. Now, I 
took, they had a bull ring. Everything that they

33:33.485 --> 33:38.212
wanted to ram a freshman for, give him demerits, 
they'd give him demerits. They didn't care about

33:38.232 --> 33:41.076
college regulations, it was their regulations. 
So... So...

33:50.228 --> 33:57.098
So we went from there. I took the bullring, and I'll 
explain to you what the bullring was. These

34:02.145 --> 34:05.670
freshmen that were rammed for not doing 
something. I got some saws and axes and

34:07.172 --> 34:18.548
transportation from the building and grounds 
department, and I took the bullring on Saturday

34:07.172 --> 34:18.548
afternoon and Sunday afternoon, and we went out 
between here and the drill field and the airport

34:18.646 --> 34:26.520
out there and found plenty of dead or semi-dead 
stuff. We brought in, we built a modern log

34:26.540 --> 34:31.449
bonfire. And it just took one year to start a new 
tradition here. They're building the same type of

34:39.166 --> 34:47.121
of Bonfire ever since.

34:47.402 --> 34:49.887
What brought you to College Station? Why did you 
come here?

34:55.036 --> 35:00.567
As a high school player, I was fast and quick. And 
that helped me make four touchdowns against the

35:01.508 --> 35:13.568
team that thought they were the state champions 
until they made a mistake and played our high

35:01.508 --> 35:13.568
school team. That was Fitzgerald Clark at 
Tullahoma Private School. There weren't many

35:19.678 --> 35:22.703
high schools in Tennessee when I was a youngster. 
They were prep schools, privately owned prep

35:22.723 --> 35:26.048
schools. Well, I didn't have anything. Now, I 
graduated from that school. I didn't have any

35:34.767 --> 35:35.688
money. I was offered $40 a month to be freight clerk 
there at the end of the railroad. I would have taken

35:42.015 --> 35:49.723
it, but a boy from Brandon Training School down at 
Shelbyville, Tennessee, sent his son up there,

35:51.172 --> 36:01.982
the headmaster, to recruit me and see if I wouldn't 
come down there and play, have another year in high

35:51.172 --> 36:01.982
school. I was already, I had plenty of credits when 
I graduated from that high school. But I didn't

36:08.108 --> 36:12.473
have anything else to do, so I decided, well, heck 
yeah, that'll be fun. And I went down there and I

36:13.393 --> 36:20.200
took French and German and a little more history. 
The ex Bible

36:20.534 --> 36:30.707
was my Latin teacher. I took another year of Latin 
down there. We used to take Latin in those days,

36:33.110 --> 36:38.737
four years of Latin before I got through. Now, the 
ex Bible was one of the, I would say the top six

36:46.049 --> 36:51.836
coaches that the United States has ever had 
anywhere. We were very successful at this Brandon

36:53.358 --> 36:57.263
Training School. I made a lot of touchdowns for 
him. And he was a good Christian man, and he taught a

37:01.428 --> 37:09.879
Sunday school class in Mississippi College, the 
Baylor of Mississippi, which is at Clinton. Yes,

37:10.700 --> 37:14.605
nine miles this side of Jackson.

37:17.622 --> 37:28.319
I

37:17.622 --> 37:28.319
don't want to repeat.

37:32.165 --> 37:40.137
He

37:32.165 --> 37:40.137
taught a Sunday school class.

37:40.724 --> 37:46.310
And he was very successful as a coach in Middle 
Tennessee among those high schools. And there was

37:47.051 --> 37:53.959
a preacher at this church where he taught the 
class, was a graduate of Mississippi College. And

37:54.019 --> 37:55.260
they were looking for a coach. And he wrote down 
there and said, boy, we've got the fella you want.

38:00.266 --> 38:01.588
He is a dandy. And they asked him to come down there. 
He made a favorable impression and they hired him.

38:09.714 --> 38:13.018
He came back up and said, boy you're going to 
college with me. I went to college with him and I

38:14.440 --> 38:20.767
graduated with distinction. I made six 
touchdowns against the University of

38:21.208 --> 38:28.517
Mississippi in one football game. We beat Tulane, 
we beat Mississippi State. Alabama never beat us

38:33.956 --> 38:35.658
more. Well, we led them at a half one time. I 
happened to get loose for 80 yards. And we led them

38:43.408 --> 38:46.132
at the half, but they just beat us down. But we never 
played anybody at home because we didn't even have

38:46.492 --> 38:49.837
a stadium.

38:53.041 --> 38:53.181
Oh, no. But oldie X... got the job at Texas A&M 
College. We both went to the war, First World War.

39:01.687 --> 39:10.319
And he says, I've got to be the freshman coach out 
there for one year because they got a man who's got

39:01.687 --> 39:10.319
one year on his contract. But we want you. And so he 
said, boy, you go come out there with me. You take

39:18.630 --> 39:23.597
the job there for a year, and in that year, this man 
will... be out of the way and I'll be athletic

39:23.797 --> 39:27.522
director and I won't hire you." And so I've been 
with that man ever since 1912. He's been dead for

39:32.268 --> 39:33.710
two years. He stayed with us for twelve years and 
then he pulled off going to Nebraska and then he

39:33.790 --> 39:47.948
came to Texas and then that's it. That's my story. 
And then I've been track coach here for all those

39:51.816 --> 39:55.059
years. What were the years that you were track 
coach?

40:03.809 --> 40:05.331
The spring of 22. Since the spring of 22.

40:10.456 --> 40:14.661
Except this time I was out in the Army and was out as 
commandant. Now, the board of directors came up

40:16.025 --> 40:22.439
here with all this. They were going to strike on me.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.878
Here's a good story. They made the freshmen, 
upperclassmen would make freshmen bring them

40:32.022 --> 40:38.670
some food Sunday morning or something they didn't 
want to go. Well, eight demerits for taking food

40:38.870 --> 40:42.895
from the mess hall. So they'd make the freshmen 
bring them some food. Well, the freshmen get

40:46.840 --> 40:48.963
caught sometimes. And they would give eight 
demerits. That was the college rule. The board of

40:52.427 --> 40:53.969
directors made that rule. If you take food from the 
mess hall, it's eight demerits. And demerits

40:59.075 --> 41:01.438
hurts you. Well,

41:02.245 --> 41:09.074
after one year, I'd already made them do this and 
made them do that and the other. Made them a

41:10.055 --> 41:12.418
bonfire. They copied it and went on with it, which 
was fine. I didn't have to build it the second year

41:15.281 --> 41:22.771
because they didn't quit turning, running off 
everybody's stuff. They'd run off with a bunch of

41:22.871 --> 41:27.036
creosoted poles. Well, I made them take them back. 
Anything they could get there, they'd use it. Oh,

41:36.748 --> 41:39.051
they were rough and tough in those days. They sure 
were. Somebody had to slow them down. All right,

41:41.955 --> 41:57.075
they finally, the board of directors and the 
president and so forth, they just said, you

41:41.955 --> 41:57.075
believe in revolution, you don't believe in 
evolution. I said, well, we've been getting

41:57.680 --> 42:04.359
nowhere in all these years I've been here, and I'm 
just starting. But they said, well, listen, will

42:04.379 --> 42:10.155
you please go on back down to the athletic field? 
Oh, no. They didn't want to fire me because here I

42:13.154 --> 42:28.632
had a stack of letters and telegrams that high 
supporting me against them, against all these

42:13.154 --> 42:28.632
people that had the kids run off, you see, were on my 
side. And they just shared the outfit with, you

42:28.612 --> 42:36.563
back that man, he's what needs, somebody needs to 
be done. Well, they got me, they got me, but they

42:36.884 --> 42:47.800
just made nice for me, bent back down to something I 
really enjoyed doing, and we really had fun. For

42:47.980 --> 42:52.146
the next, out of the next seven years, we won six 
championships in a row. That's wonderful, that's

42:52.166 --> 42:53.708
wonderful. So and I was having a good time and a good 
life, but I did get the job done because Gib

42:53.688 --> 43:10.466
Gilchrist, a Texas University graduate, was the 
next president of this outfit and he took my

42:53.688 --> 43:10.466
program up and we started to grow. We started to 
grow. In 1936, 1937, we had 34,500 students. Now we

43:24.491 --> 43:26.496
have 35,000 students. That's right. Excuse me, I 
would like to turn the tape over just one minute.
