00:03.187 --> 00:20.966
September 12, sitting in almost central Oklahoma 
City in the living room with Elaine Bezell

00:03.187 --> 00:20.966
Thompson, going to record her recollections of 
the teens and part of the 20s at Texas A&M. Now, Mrs.

00:21.727 --> 00:26.652
Thompson, would you respond just briefly so we'll 
be sure your mic is working? Well, I'll try. That's

00:29.055 --> 00:30.156
enough. We've unearthed a few. Oh, look at that. 
Mrs. Thompson, would you describe the background

00:37.944 --> 00:42.671
of your parents? Introduce us to your parents. 
Where did they grow up? When did they get to Texas?

00:50.962 --> 00:59.974
Well, they were... See, I'm already not sure 
about... My father... I know he lived, he was born

01:00.578 --> 01:05.566
in Washington County, I think. And his father died 
when I was under four years old. And my grandmother

01:18.246 --> 01:25.557
came and lived with us all the rest of her life. She 
lived to be 91. And so I don't know much about the

01:28.675 --> 01:32.259
background of his... Were they farmers? They were 
farmers. And she was very ambitious for him. She

01:40.850 --> 01:44.895
was determined that he was going to have a fine 
education. And

01:46.597 --> 01:51.903
so they had good years and bad years. That's the way 
that Brazos bought them farming country-wise. It

01:56.148 --> 01:59.673
was either wonderful or bad. And so they had good 
years. Where did your mother grow up?

02:07.745 --> 02:13.933
My mother was born in Tennessee, and I don't know 
anything about that far background. Where did

02:15.135 --> 02:16.217
your parents meet? Navasota.

02:20.343 --> 02:23.387
After his first... was superintendent of schools 
in Navasota. And then when I was four, we moved away

02:29.926 --> 02:35.113
and went to Denton. Denton, Texas. Did your dad 
grow up in a church-going family? Yes. Do I dare ask

02:42.242 --> 02:43.363
which? Well,

02:43.823 --> 02:53.155
his family were Baptists, and he married my 
mother, who was a Methodist. And all through the

02:53.557 --> 02:58.864
years, they stayed with their same denomination. 
Why they didn't combine, which would have been a

02:59.264 --> 03:04.771
lot better, you know, because... But after we got 
to A&M, you know, so different there. Now, I don't

03:12.081 --> 03:17.147
know whether to go ahead with that part about 
the... Sure, sure. Guy and Hall, I'm sure you're

03:17.167 --> 03:23.175
probably familiar with Guy and Hall was built... 
while we were down there. And the way things were,

03:25.518 --> 03:44.074
every Sunday morning, the whole cadet corps, with 
all the full uniforms and everything, marched

03:25.518 --> 03:44.074
into Guyon Hall for the church service. And my 
father didn't like that at all. He said there was

03:49.639 --> 03:53.162
every denomination, every race, in the borough in 
that full auditorium for all those boys to march in

03:53.986 --> 04:21.462
there and sit down and go to sleep the ones that were 
not interested and he didn't think that was good

03:53.986 --> 04:21.462
and so he came up with the idea that he was going to 
have a good speaker he knew so many ministers out

03:53.986 --> 04:21.462
over the country that were fine well just good 
reputations and all and they'd have a different

04:21.712 --> 04:45.711
one every Sunday they had one of each you know one 
time it would be Methodist maybe the next time it

04:21.712 --> 04:45.711
would be a Jewish robbery it was a strange way of 
doing things but that It was the only way he could

04:46.028 --> 04:52.035
see that they could get everybody some time. Did he 
help select the individual speakers? He did that.

04:56.180 --> 04:56.761
He did that? He did that. And he knew so many of them 
because my brother and I went on summer vacations

04:58.443 --> 05:12.880
with him after after my brother and I were born, we 
went every summer to someplace where he was

05:13.585 --> 05:20.074
getting another degree. And every Sunday we went 
to a church because he knew all about the minister.

05:27.205 --> 05:32.432
And, oh, he'd either read books about him. He was 
well informed on. So I don't know exactly. I was not

05:36.518 --> 05:43.508
old enough to know how that turned out, but it was a 
very unusual way of doing that. And as far as you

05:43.673 --> 05:49.922
remember, there were Protestant, Catholic, and 
Jewish speakers. Well, just whoever was, well,

05:49.942 --> 05:54.708
yes, I think so, yeah. As far as you recall, how was 
your father selected to be the president at the

05:56.110 --> 06:06.305
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas? 
How was he selected? I don't know how he was

06:09.509 --> 06:12.313
selected. And you were four years old when they got 
there? Is that right? I was born in 1904, and I was

06:20.629 --> 06:26.695
four years old when we went to Denton. I was living 
in Navasota, because I was born in Navasota, and my

06:26.815 --> 06:35.384
mother's family all in Navasota. All right, so you 
were then 11 when you and your family moved to

06:36.305 --> 06:43.532
college. Is that what it was called then? Uh-huh. 
Yeah. All right. Do you remember your first

06:50.137 --> 06:54.065
impressions of A&M? Well, see, I got four years in 
Denton first. So that's where I started the

06:59.577 --> 07:01.842
school, in Denton. And I'm not just sure. I had a 
feeling I was about fourth grade or fifth grade

07:05.300 --> 07:13.311
when I came, when we moved down there. I'm not good 
on dates about when that was. Did you enjoy getting

07:18.399 --> 07:24.427
to college, to A&M, as a little girl? Well, it was, 
you know, it was different than when I was in high

07:25.408 --> 07:30.175
school, of course. but but i had um the dean of 
agriculture lived right down the street from us

07:30.543 --> 07:53.445
and his their daughter was lily best kyle kyle 
field you know and so she was my best friend on the

07:30.543 --> 07:53.445
campus when we were children we played together 
And she's about the only little girl that I

07:54.708 --> 08:03.259
remember playing with because she was so close. 
What do you remember about the Kyle family? We

08:06.864 --> 08:10.148
don't know much about Dean Kyle in terms of 
personality. Well, I don't remember anything

08:11.850 --> 08:16.977
except mother and father. Was he a nice, pleasant 
man? Oh, yes. Yes, the family was really very nice.

08:23.598 --> 08:30.827
What did two little girls do to, what kind of fun and 
games did you all play? We played dolls.

08:34.652 --> 08:38.798
I can even remember, it didn't have to be a real 
doll. We all had dolls. We had plenty of toys, but we

08:40.420 --> 08:44.926
had lots of dolls. But I can remember one time, she 
and I were, After the woodpile was, of course, they

08:50.733 --> 08:56.000
all had wood fire places. And we took just a log of 
wood and we put baby clothes on it. And that was

09:04.792 --> 09:10.259
something I hadn't thought of in a long time, but I 
remember doing that. Do you remember any mischief

09:11.881 --> 09:16.147
that you all ever got into? I don't remember any. I 
don't think we did. So mother didn't have to spank

09:20.433 --> 09:24.199
or anything like that? No, I'm sure maybe she did,

09:24.659 --> 09:30.248
but I don't remember. Describe the president's 
house where you all lived. Well, it was a real

09:34.394 --> 09:39.421
old-fashioned house, and I just loved it. Well, I 
say I loved it, but it was just home to me. I've lived

09:49.525 --> 09:57.297
in three presents homes from the time I left 
Navasota till I got married. How

09:57.357 --> 10:10.757
lovely, what a nice picture of it. Does that look 
like it? Oh, it's exactly like it, sure. Where was

10:14.523 --> 10:17.507
your room? Well, it was one of these upstairs front 
ones. I don't remember. I can see my grandmother

10:24.961 --> 10:27.143
had one of them. My mother and father had the first 
one. My grandmother, and then I had my, thanks for

10:30.066 --> 10:34.311
having his. So we pretty well filled up the house. 
Did you all ever play any games out on those

10:39.617 --> 10:45.503
porches?

10:47.862 --> 10:48.763
No, I don't think.

10:51.767 --> 10:55.472
The downstairs porch, we probably did.

10:58.335 --> 11:13.414
And I'll tell you, I don't know whether this is at 
least a bit interesting, but the thing I remember

10:58.335 --> 11:13.414
about the downstairs porch, they had greenery. 
shrubs and things across the front that sort of hid

11:15.048 --> 11:36.246
the where the chairs were behind it and I had a 
parrot and the parrot was really a good talker and

11:15.048 --> 11:36.246
then I'd put the parrot up in the just on one of the 
little branches and I'd sit back in the chair and

11:36.800 --> 11:46.668
then the cadets would walk by and this parrot would 
say, hello, like that. And I would just be so

11:47.269 --> 11:51.822
embarrassed I could hardly stand. Now that's the 
kind of things you remember when you're 95 years

11:51.802 --> 11:57.435
old. And those are the good things that we want. I 
can't see if that is anything that could possibly

11:59.961 --> 12:04.872
help you. Do you remember where the parrot came 
from? No. How long did you have it? I don't know but

12:11.917 --> 12:19.170
it was so funny when he sang grand opera and I did all 
kinds of things. We had it for quite a long time. Did

12:21.054 --> 12:21.735
he have a name? What was his name? Polly, what did 
you say?

12:28.707 --> 12:31.292
Polly Parrott. a black couple that worked for us. 
See, I'm just going from one something to another.

12:41.517 --> 12:44.942
Henrietta and Ulysses S. Grant McElroy.

12:47.525 --> 13:00.823
So

12:47.525 --> 13:00.823
this parrot was just called Henrietta, 
Henrietta,

12:47.525 --> 13:00.823
Grant. Where did they live? Did they live there? 
Had quarters out in the back. In the back? Were

13:07.419 --> 13:11.503
there other black families living anywhere 
nearby? No,

13:11.563 --> 13:21.513
because, let's see, I have to clear myself now. 
Yes, it would be there. The reason I hate to switch

13:26.037 --> 13:29.781
off, if you can cut it off, You know, around 
college. And they, for your family, she was the

13:35.569 --> 13:42.237
maid and cook? Yep. And what did he do? Well, he 
drove the car. Okay. My father, I will have to

13:47.423 --> 13:55.733
admit, they never did learn to be expert at driving 
cars. The children will say... Y'all moved there

13:58.803 --> 14:00.245
in 1915. Did y'all, you went, I presume, went on the 
train? Oh, sure. Well, I guess, let's see. From

14:09.515 --> 14:11.137
Denton to College Station?

14:16.423 --> 14:22.971
Well, we had a car somewhere along in there, but I 
can't remember just when the What kind of cars were

14:23.204 --> 14:25.366
they, do you remember? I don't remember the name of 
it, but I remember certain things about the cars. I

14:31.113 --> 14:46.731
remember my father had to open the front lights up 
and light them and close them back up again, some

14:31.113 --> 14:46.731
kind of gas lights or something. And they were all, 
of course, open, and then they had canvas little

14:51.301 --> 15:20.515
curtains that would come down to keep the rain out 
if you were lucky and of course the roads were

14:51.301 --> 15:20.515
nothing but slippery mud we used to drive down to 
navasota on weekends to visit the relatives and

14:51.301 --> 15:20.515
and it was as if it rained it was a pretty bad where 
when you got to to a m where did you go to school

15:20.866 --> 15:21.427
Brian. And how did you get to Brian? On a streetcar, 
trolley. All the campus children got on the

15:27.796 --> 15:37.090
trolley and we went to grade school, all up, 
graduated from high school that way. So did you

15:37.671 --> 15:40.115
graduate from Brian High School? What year? 21. 
21. Do you remember how many were in the senior

15:44.742 --> 15:47.606
class? I've got my yearbook right there. Ralph, 
would you want to get the yearbook? Describe what

15:54.386 --> 15:59.957
you recall about Bryan High School. Was it fun? Did 
you enjoy it? Yes. I'm telling you, when you're at

16:05.607 --> 16:14.042
that age, high school age, and living in a 
situation like that, You always kind of had your

16:14.478 --> 16:20.224
eyes on the freshman A&M students. And it was kind 
of tough on the high school boys. But we had a good

16:24.768 --> 16:28.252
football team. And of course, some of us were not 
allowed to date the A&M boys anyway. So until

16:33.597 --> 16:37.581
later. Was that a rule for you? Were you not allowed 
to date the A&M boys? Well, not until I was a certain

16:41.385 --> 16:44.248
age. And then I don't think I had any dates with 
anybody until I was 16, which seems about right to

16:45.022 --> 16:54.777
me, I guess, maybe.

16:59.284 --> 17:07.857
But it was kind of a touchy thing with the high 
school boys.

17:10.081 --> 17:11.643
I bet this is the annual. Do you want to just see what 
it looks like?

17:20.677 --> 17:20.997
Let's see. I'm turning the pages now. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32,

17:22.479 --> 17:36.460
34, 36, 37,

17:37.672 --> 17:41.281
Looks like about 42 or 43 in your senior class. Now 
when you finished high school, where did you want

17:43.807 --> 17:50.162
to go to college? A&M. Where did your family want 
you to go to college? Well, they didn't want me to go

17:55.640 --> 17:59.543
to college at A&M. My father had great 
expectations, but I was never the great student.

18:04.748 --> 18:08.812
My brother was, but I had a lot of other interests. 
You'd think I was a frivolous butterfly, if you

18:09.873 --> 18:19.963
hear me tell about my fun I had at Texas A&M. But I 
just loved everything about Texas A&M. How did you

18:25.905 --> 18:29.431
persuade your parents to allow you to attend A&M? 
Well, they just gave in. They didn't complain too

18:33.659 --> 18:38.106
much. I never did want to ever go away from home.

18:47.281 --> 19:11.618
so they they just let me do it of course my father had 
me taking every course in the world high school i

18:47.281 --> 19:11.618
took four years of latin and about four years of 
well all the math and english and ancient history

18:47.281 --> 19:11.618
and and then went to oh and physics And then when I 
got to A&M, that first, I'd had two years at A&M. And

19:19.594 --> 19:31.387
he had me take chemistry and analytics at A&M, 
because I had trigonometry before in high school.

19:31.888 --> 19:38.415
So I really took

19:31.888 --> 19:38.415
all the, he had great, education ambition, I 
guess, for me. But I just didn't want to go off to

19:45.167 --> 19:49.473
school. Did your father believe in equal 
education for women? Did he think women should be

19:53.819 --> 19:56.242
educated as well as men? Well, yes, I'm sure he did, 
but he didn't mean for them to be a Texas A&M

19:58.525 --> 20:05.795
man. Of course, yeah. I had heard that he certainly 
did. Oh yes, he sure would.

20:14.551 --> 20:21.260
When you enrolled as a freshman at A&M, do you know 
how many other coeds there were that year? I think

20:21.660 --> 20:28.129
Helen Dowdy was one of them, and I think she moved to 
go to live with her uncle and aunt who were on the

20:29.408 --> 20:39.662
campus, and I had an idea that she wanted to do the 
same thing. I never did know for sure that that was

20:39.682 --> 20:47.752
right, but she lived with them for those two years. 
Have there been any women enrolled before you and

20:47.933 --> 20:53.560
her?

20:55.312 --> 21:03.564
Yes, and I don't know whether there was...

21:03.664 --> 21:07.990
I have a yearbook over here, too, I thought you 
might be interested in seeing. 1922.

21:11.795 --> 21:22.230
And it seemed like somewhere in one of those books 
that it said that there was some talk about

21:11.795 --> 21:22.230
women... Did... When you took classes, you were in 
a room full of young men. Where did a young lady sit?

21:34.472 --> 21:35.794
Just right in there. You might go in and sit down, 
and the boys might come in and sit all around the

21:35.834 --> 21:43.443
room. But we just sat in there like the rest of them. 
Thank you. Were there any rules? that your father

21:54.644 --> 22:04.738
gave you as an undergraduate about what you could 
and could not do while you were an Aggie? No, they

22:06.962 --> 22:12.590
just treated me just like they did when I was in high 
school, I think. Was it okay then for you to date A&M

22:13.511 --> 22:16.956
students? Oh, yes, yes. Tell me about some A&M 
social events. Well, they had absolutely

22:26.799 --> 22:38.574
super-duper balls, two of them, Thanksgiving Hop 
and the Ross Vaughn Tear Hop. And I mean, it was

22:38.594 --> 22:42.859
decorated to clear out the mess hall. to take every 
bit of furniture out except for the line of chairs

22:44.510 --> 22:58.046
for all the big number of chaperones, the faculty 
people that they would invite to be chaperones.

22:59.267 --> 23:10.720
And they

22:59.267 --> 23:10.720
always had a grand march.

23:14.564 --> 23:20.472
Were the young men, did you always have a date? 
Sure, oh yes. Did you then have a dance card where

23:23.295 --> 23:27.020
you signed? Yes, a dance card, you fill that out. 
Where did they get their dates? The, pardon me, the

23:34.950 --> 23:40.858
faculty. people had kept the girls, and they could 
invite their girls from home, and the hostess

23:42.492 --> 24:00.099
would invite them to come, and the parents let them 
come down and stay with those people. The faculty

24:00.119 --> 24:10.255
houses were just full, and in our house, we've had 
as many as six or eight stay at our house. Did young

24:10.572 --> 24:13.296
ladies come down from CIA? They just came down from 
all over the state. And I presume more often than

24:20.407 --> 24:24.193
not came on the train? Yes. At those dances, was 
there any alcohol served? Not supposed to be at

24:31.902 --> 24:33.544
all. Of course, there was never any drink, and 
you'd get expelled if you got caught more than once

24:33.884 --> 24:40.612
or twice, I think. I don't remember exactly about 
that. But once in a while, there would be somebody

24:44.876 --> 24:54.066
at the dance that would tag you. Of course, it was 
tagging. Oh, just so much, because there were so

24:58.717 --> 25:02.802
many stags. And if anybody would tag me that had had 
something to drink, one of my friends was just

25:02.862 --> 25:12.254
right there. Describe what a young lady would have 
worn to one of those balls. We had real fancy

25:18.922 --> 25:27.272
clothes and real high heels to dance in. My 
children heard me say I didn't know that people

25:28.619 --> 25:35.690
weren't just supposed to have hurt feet, hurting 
feet. Because I always had hurting feet from

25:36.952 --> 25:39.997
dancing. Now those dances, and this will surprise 
you probably if you don't already know it. The

25:46.368 --> 25:49.733
dance would last from 9 to 12. Then you'd have an 
hour off. And you'd go to these different places.

25:55.621 --> 26:00.767
My mother always had a little midnight supper, 
light, something, you know. And the boys and girls

26:02.368 --> 26:09.036
would take part in that. And then when the hour was 
up, or exactly how long it was, we'd all go back to

26:09.737 --> 26:16.885
the mess hall and dance till about three. and you 
know why my feet hurt

26:18.637 --> 26:43.935
but it was simply wonderful it was just the most fun 
of anything in this world and the ross volunteer

26:18.637 --> 26:43.935
hop was in the other part of the year and these were 
held in was sebisa hall built yet sebisa dining

26:18.637 --> 26:43.935
hall yes so they were held there Well, there was a 
great big mess hall that all the student body ate in

26:44.033 --> 26:50.080
there. Where did the orchestra come from? Well, of 
course they had an orchestra right there, but I

26:54.565 --> 27:02.914
don't remember now whether they had outside 
orchestras come in or not. These beautiful

27:04.035 --> 27:10.783
dresses, did you all buy them or did someone make 
them for you? Well, mine were mostly bought. We'd

27:15.012 --> 27:16.555
go to Houston to shop. And that's where I got my high 
heel shoes. And was a Houston trip an all day or an

27:22.508 --> 27:27.077
overnight trip?

27:30.043 --> 27:33.210
I believe we'd spend the night in the hotels. I've 
forgotten exactly how far it is to Houston. Do you

27:38.945 --> 27:39.406
remember? About 100 miles. 100 miles, yeah. No, I 
think we went down there to shop. Bryan was not a

27:46.314 --> 27:50.279
very good place to shop, as you can imagine. And did 
your parents have you take piano, ballet? I took

27:58.789 --> 28:03.214
piano lessons from the time I was a little girl 
until I... but got to Norman and even took piano

28:05.033 --> 28:08.600
lessons at OU. When you were at A&M, who was your 
teacher? Miss Friley. Friley. Is that name

28:15.754 --> 28:17.277
familiar to you? No, ma'am, it's not. Mr. Friley, 
or Dr. Friley, I've forgotten which we called him,

28:18.297 --> 28:31.674
he went from A&M to become president of another 
school. And I used to know the Frileys and my

28:31.935 --> 28:39.985
family, but I can't remember which school it was. 
What did he teach? Do you remember? I don't

28:43.653 --> 28:45.055
remember that either. I don't remember anything 
except the music teacher. So she had a number of

28:49.582 --> 28:51.805
piano students? Did you take ballet or any other? I 
took the Scottish fling.

29:03.323 --> 29:08.571
I don't know why, and that lasted about a year, but 
And I wasn't carried away with that. But of course,

29:14.149 --> 29:21.519
you know, the Ross Volunteers, I just thought that 
was the most wonderful group. And I guess they

29:23.121 --> 29:29.970
still have that fancy drill they do. And people 
would come from everywhere.

29:35.770 --> 29:40.175
cars, it was all cars at that time, a lot of people 
had cars. And they would come, you'd have cars all

29:41.516 --> 29:50.286
around the field and they'd get out and they were 
just wonderful. Did the Ross Volunteers wear

29:50.667 --> 29:54.531
those spotless white uniforms? Oh, you bet. Yes, 
they had the swords and everything. I just loved

29:59.436 --> 30:02.740
all that military. When a group of young people 
wanted to go out on a picnic, wanted to go somewhere

30:03.580 --> 30:12.031
off campus, where were the favorite places? The 
Brazos River. And they'd even swim in it, and I

30:16.256 --> 30:19.921
wouldn't get in that water. But

30:21.983 --> 30:31.495
I can remember we'd have, oh, there'd be some kind 
of a truck. We'd get in a truck and one of the boys

30:31.745 --> 30:37.150
would have a guitar.

30:39.092 --> 30:46.820
And we'd go down there and have picnics and swim if 
he wanted to. What kind of a bathing suit did the

30:47.581 --> 30:50.323
young lady wear then? It was not like you have now.

30:59.757 --> 31:05.965
They were just one piece, but a cover-up.

31:09.950 --> 31:10.811
Bare legs? You didn't have the long skirt. Was that 
your mother's? Oh, well, no. Part of the time, I

31:15.216 --> 31:28.633
think we got to where we had bare legs, but I think my 
mother sewed long black stockings onto them,

31:30.993 --> 31:34.539
bathing suit. Now, did a typical young lady in that 
era ever smoke?

31:41.490 --> 31:43.814
You know, I don't even remember about that. I think 
you would have if you had. Yeah, I think so. But it

31:47.220 --> 31:50.085
would be the rare thing if they did. Now,

31:51.747 --> 31:56.916
this is prohibition time. Where did the, if there 
was any alcohol, where did they get it? I have no

32:02.215 --> 32:03.463
idea.
