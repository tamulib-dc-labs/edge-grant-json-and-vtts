00:03.507 --> 00:08.775
The library was my salvation for many reasons, and 
I'll get back to that later on. But the first year I

00:08.795 --> 00:11.138
worked wherever I could. I'd say I worked in 
horticulture. I'd sometimes babysit for

00:14.122 --> 00:16.666
professors. I was one of the early babysitters. I 
can even remember the people I babysat for. Some of

00:23.215 --> 00:24.757
them have just recently passed on. Who?

00:28.162 --> 00:29.304
Draper from poetry. Do you remember him? I call him 
Red, I believe. He was red-headed. They had a mean

00:32.802 --> 00:34.865
little boy. Did they live on campus? They lived, I 
think, in College Hills, I guess. Everybody lived

00:40.092 --> 00:43.957
pretty close then and there. I did weekend work for 
Professor Darnell in Daring. I remember he worked

00:48.603 --> 00:52.688
me one whole afternoon where he was trimming his 
pecan. I just had a pickup job. But in the second

00:54.551 --> 01:02.421
semester of my freshman year, I got a pretty steady 
employment at the poultry farm, which was

00:54.551 --> 01:02.421
located... Well, this side of the research park at 
that time. Oh, west of the tracks. Yeah, west on the

01:07.592 --> 01:08.934
campus. And of course, nobody had cars. I mean, 
there were no buses. And you didn't have a bike. No,

01:14.439 --> 01:15.060
no bike. So you walked over. We walked a lot. But as I 
said, I preferred to, as I said, do my studying in

01:18.964 --> 01:23.770
short bursts. And if I had an hour between classes, 
I always reworked my class notes. and studied

01:31.527 --> 01:35.493
ahead, and I felt I was more efficient studying in 
bursts. And as I said, that three or four hours in

01:35.673 --> 01:44.966
forced CQ was just awfully hard sometimes to stay 
awake at, because you couldn't talk to your

01:35.673 --> 01:44.966
roommate. They'd catch you talking to your 
roommate, and you were in trouble. You had to

01:47.890 --> 01:48.971
study. And I think it probably was a good thing for 
many students, because they didn't horse around.

01:53.358 --> 01:58.024
And you had to be accountable for who you were at the 
time. on your schedule. You had it posted on your

01:59.709 --> 02:04.346
doors so the upperclassmen would know where you 
were and so forth. And if you were not accounted

02:04.367 --> 02:09.145
for, you'd probably hear about it. But I stole time 
to some of my work situations, and then I

02:09.665 --> 02:19.294
discovered the library, and particularly 
between classes, I usually came to the library.

02:19.514 --> 02:25.820
Did you have a special place in the library that was 
your... Yeah, I guess they refurnished all of

02:19.514 --> 02:25.820
that. It was up in that big second floor reference 
room. A nice place to study. A cushion. But that was

02:32.827 --> 02:36.430
pretty much the routine. How did you learn all of 
the... lingo, the... Well, it was beat into you.

02:44.662 --> 02:47.244
But I was, to this day, I'm that way. If I take a trip 
or something, I read everything I can about it. And

02:51.788 --> 02:54.230
I say this, I'm still looking for it. If you don't 
have this YMCA book, you need to find it. Because

02:57.734 --> 03:03.719
it's only a pamphlet, but it was very specific 
about, you know, it had all the yells in it. I

03:03.759 --> 03:04.900
memorized all those. I memorized the words to the 
songs before I heard the tunes. And we had lots of

03:09.267 --> 03:13.333
y'all practices where you learned these things. 
And like I say, this thing where how you respond to,

03:13.433 --> 03:18.221
you never say no. Sir, not having been informed for 
the highest degree of accuracy, I hesitate to

03:18.241 --> 03:22.728
articulate. That type of thing. And you're just 
learning.

03:32.082 --> 03:34.566
The other thing you had to learn as a freshman on 
board, you had to know where every building was and

03:32.082 --> 03:34.566
when it was built. And it had a good purpose to this 
day.

03:43.203 --> 03:47.410
Frank, Frank, question about buildings that 
didn't exist. As I

03:47.430 --> 04:09.447
said,

03:47.430 --> 04:09.447
learning

03:47.430 --> 04:09.447
the buildings made you helpful to any visitor on 
the campus. You had no trouble directing to any

04:12.357 --> 04:16.401
particular building on the campus. Not only did we 
have to know the correct name, we had to know when it

04:16.461 --> 04:20.826
was built. And in that first fall, how did you 
communicate with family back home? Letters, just

04:27.032 --> 04:28.273
strictly letters. About how often? Well, this was 
the other thing. This is why I say don't plan on

04:30.155 --> 04:34.600
going home. That's the worst thing you could do. 
Just stay the first semester and go home

04:36.342 --> 04:39.265
Christmas. I guess, I don't know, I guess I did go 
home on Thanksgiving, I don't know. I wrote a lot of

04:44.888 --> 04:48.217
letters to my mother, probably about weekly. And 
did they write to you? Oh yes. Did you get any kush?

04:55.833 --> 04:56.454
by mail? No, I don't think so. Some of the other guys 
did. Did you all use that word then? Yeah, of

05:02.220 --> 05:03.361
course, for dessert. I never had a sweet tooth. My 
mother knew that. I never had much on dessert or

05:06.324 --> 05:09.207
sweet things. She may have sent me some. I can't 
remember, but I know it was always an occasion if

05:11.909 --> 05:24.082
somebody else got some because they'd either have 
to share it with you or else, but that was always an

05:11.909 --> 05:24.082
interesting day. A mail call was You really looked 
forward to mail. You had, don't guess at that time I

05:26.797 --> 05:33.163
even had any female contacts. Male call. I didn't 
tell them about mail call. There was not mail call.

05:38.648 --> 05:39.289
You had a box. There was a sub box down here. What was 
the name of the old Casey's on the corner by the

05:41.611 --> 05:48.037
dorm? They'd had part of that at the post office. I 
don't recall. Those were the charge boxes. When I

05:54.002 --> 05:54.983
first came, you couldn't. They were all full. I had 
to go to Northgate to get my mail. But mail from home

05:58.363 --> 06:01.107
was just like in the military. You really, I mean, 
you went by every day even though you didn't get one

06:01.187 --> 06:04.852
or two things of leave. But I guess, as I said, I 
didn't have a girlfriend at that time. And a lot of

06:08.677 --> 06:10.840
the other guys didn't. A lot of the problems, I 
think, that some of the people had in adjusting was

06:10.860 --> 06:16.948
many of them had high school sweethearts. And it 
was a sore process of breaking up that they were all

06:17.068 --> 06:24.278
needed, you know, because of the distance 
involved. Describe your impression of your first

06:24.882 --> 06:31.248
Yale practice and first football game. Well, I 
have to even go back to this. I guess that was enough

06:36.013 --> 06:44.120
to

06:36.013 --> 06:44.120
have scared me off of the place before I got down 
here. As I recall, the school didn't start until

06:45.421 --> 06:51.527
late September. It lasted until late January, all 
semester. But I think even before I came down here,

06:55.308 --> 07:01.859
maybe it was the first week or so, I can't remember. 
We played Texas Tech at the Alamo Stadium in San

07:03.021 --> 07:06.087
Antonio. And I went there, and I don't know how they 
found out I was a freshman. I can't remember. Maybe

07:11.797 --> 07:13.460
it was after he started. Anyway, I got a lot of abuse 
there from upperclassmen. And, you know, hump it

07:17.968 --> 07:19.671
and yell at me. It was all just. a big blur to me. I 
didn't even know all the L's. I mean, I said I'd

07:23.674 --> 07:27.137
studied them before, but it was different. But 
anyway, that was my first, I guess, real contact

07:27.157 --> 07:33.943
with some of the upperclassmen and their 
behavior.

07:36.885 --> 07:38.407
But that was pretty much it. I kept promising 
myself, just hang on for a year. I mean, just

07:47.334 --> 07:50.357
whatever it does to hang on, just, I mean, The 
drop-off rate was horrific. I mean, I went

07:53.153 --> 07:58.140
anywhere from a third to a half when I dropped out. 
As you look back on that, about how many of the

07:58.180 --> 08:10.276
students left because of grades and how many left 
because of some other reason? Do you have any

08:10.316 --> 08:11.177
guess? I don't know. People rationalize. It was 
hard to admit that you were leaving because of the

08:14.722 --> 08:18.847
core activities. They would... I guess most of 
them pleaded academic problems, but it was pretty

08:22.838 --> 08:27.863
tough here for most, a lot of students. I mean, the 
professors were, you know, A's and B's weren't

08:27.883 --> 08:33.648
very, very available. The professors weren't 
pretty, a lot of professors, I'd say, had the core

08:33.668 --> 08:39.273
spirit. I mean, they expected discipline in 
there, too, and I guess some of them were former

08:39.313 --> 08:42.937
Aggies. Did you have any faculty, any instructors 
that first year that you now realize were quite

08:43.297 --> 08:49.303
important to you? Oh, yes, very definitely. I had 
one that, It was very important, Fred Bryson and

08:52.117 --> 08:55.901
Dr. Abrams. Please, please. I worked with those 
two guys. I mean, I just took one course, I think.

09:02.549 --> 09:03.971
Dr. Abrams was a wonderful professor. And Fred 
Bryson, I guess I took a course from him later on.

09:08.796 --> 09:09.918
What made them special? The fact that you were a 
human being, and you could talk to them. Did you

09:19.489 --> 09:20.470
know Fred Bryson? He was a great jokester, as you 
know. He somewhat embarrassed me years later. I'm

09:26.152 --> 09:28.274
going aside here. Oh, that's all right. Years 
later. He never forgot a student. I mean, years

09:34.079 --> 09:36.302
later, he'd know you in a crowd. And that shows that 
he did care. But anyway, I remember it was four or

09:39.104 --> 09:42.708
five years after I graduated. And I was a county 
agent. And they often brought us here for what they

09:44.590 --> 09:49.434
call short courses to update you and various 
things. And he was doing this. skill things with

09:51.753 --> 09:53.695
budding and grafting. You know what a whip graft 
is? You know where you split the two signs and you

09:56.759 --> 10:05.208
put them together and you have to make them fit very 
well and then you put wax on them and wrap them and

09:56.759 --> 10:05.208
all that. Anyway, the fit is very important. And 
this was five years or so after I was out from that

10:07.511 --> 10:11.035
school. And he suggested you hold it up to the 
light. I mean, this way, see if you see any light

10:14.779 --> 10:19.144
coming through there because if you did, you 
didn't have a good fit. And he said, of course, when

10:19.782 --> 10:24.807
Faustia was here, you could see the dome of the 
Academia.

10:25.367 --> 10:28.530
I was embarrassed, but pleased that he still 
remembered me. But he was very, those two were very

10:28.550 --> 10:34.415
important, even though I had no intention at that 
time of going into agriculture. Let me see if there

10:35.536 --> 10:48.068
were any other professors that are particularly, 
I had Darbor in animal science,

10:56.738 --> 11:08.111
I said I didn't have too much contact with my 
advisor, I would say that Adriens and Bryson kind

10:56.738 --> 11:08.111
of became my informal advisors, and they were very 
supportive. And then when I started working for

11:08.832 --> 11:22.408
the poultry farm, the head of the department at 
that time, I should remember his name, kindly old

11:08.832 --> 11:22.408
gentleman, I'm sorry it escapes me now, but he was 
understood my situation, and I had, you know,

11:23.485 --> 11:34.997
taken care of poultry before in my life, and he was, 
gave me this job over at the poultry farm, which I

11:23.485 --> 11:34.997
enjoyed and worked over there. Do you remember 
your first silver taps? Yes, I guess so. I mean,

11:43.727 --> 11:45.769
what did it? Let me say that the first year was just 
a, I don't know how to say it. Just almost

11:53.593 --> 11:59.562
a dream, or a nightmare, I guess. You did, I was, my 
objective was academics. I mean, I was determined

12:05.251 --> 12:10.178
to do my academics in spite of the Corps type of 
thing. And there's some people, I guess, who tried

12:10.238 --> 12:14.845
to get out of the Corps. I guess the rule at that time 
was that You could not, you had to be in the Corps the

12:17.890 --> 12:24.356
first two years unless you had previous military 
service or had a physical disability. And some of

12:25.417 --> 12:32.664
them, I know I forgot, they were some people who 
managed to get out of the Corps. They had another

12:32.744 --> 12:34.445
bad term in that time. It was, and some of the locals 
were the children of the faculty members and other

12:34.585 --> 12:39.470
people lived there. Call them the day duckers, 
heard that term. They had their own unit. They

12:44.074 --> 12:46.176
attended ROTC classes, but they hadn't They were 
very much supposedly looked down upon by the elite

12:46.460 --> 12:50.544
corps members. I guess, unless you want to... I 
didn't respond to your other question. What was it

12:58.693 --> 13:00.034
now? I don't remember right now. You went to 
football games. You got involved in everything.

13:06.842 --> 13:08.884
You were required to go to football games. 
Locally, you marched in, like they do now. And you

13:11.647 --> 13:14.830
were required to go to corps games At that time, in 
the Southwest Conference, the schedules were

13:15.248 --> 13:20.593
firm for year after year after year. We played SMU, 
TCU, University of Texas, Rice. When the games

13:26.218 --> 13:33.124
were in Houston or Dallas or Waco or Austin, we 
always went and we hitchhiked. It was always

13:33.144 --> 13:34.285
hitchhiking. Do you remember any good 
experiences from a court trip game? Good meaning

13:39.009 --> 13:41.732
memorable, plus or minus? Well, again, it was sort 
of a... I'm trying to think of the word. See when you

13:48.278 --> 13:55.288
hitchhiked, you left like Friday after classes 
and no telling when you'd get there. Sometimes

13:55.949 --> 14:00.636
you'd get a direct route, sometimes you'd have to, 
usually you'd have to get two or three routes. It

14:00.656 --> 14:03.661
often was very late before you got there, 
sometimes. And then you always had, before the

14:04.241 --> 14:12.694
game, the games were usually in the afternoon, you 
had the Corps parade in the morning. And then you

14:13.349 --> 14:15.652
went straight to the football game. And, of 
course, you stood the whole time there. Do you

14:19.878 --> 14:29.752
remember any negative experiences involving

14:19.878 --> 14:29.752
local people on a court trip? No, not really. I 
haven't run into any. No, not at all. And

14:34.758 --> 14:37.102
hitchhiking was a very positive thing. A&M had a 
reputation. There was a procedure. You couldn't

14:42.931 --> 14:44.953
upstream. That has a big meaning. And there was a 
designated location in every town, including

14:47.675 --> 14:51.098
here. And you just got in line. And any citizen, I 
don't care who they were, with your uniform,

14:53.700 --> 14:59.966
invariably almost picked you up. And we imagine 
how many. There were several hundred that went to a

15:01.627 --> 15:04.130
court trip on a weekend. We all got there. We 
couldn't afford to go any other way. Maybe the

15:06.952 --> 15:10.535
band, I guess the band and the team traveled by bus. 
But the rest of us all had to get there on our own. Did

15:12.850 --> 15:14.993
you hitchhike to home? Oh, yes, always. And my 
mother hated it. She thought the worst could

15:17.616 --> 15:20.760
possibly happen. I did have some interesting 
experiences. But no, it was a part of my economy. I

15:27.469 --> 15:33.036
could actually most times get there faster 
hitchhiking than I could. What route did you

15:33.897 --> 15:36.340
normally take hitchhiking? Well, since I said I'd 
live close to Randolph Field, I'd get my parents

15:37.221 --> 15:41.507
there. very reluctantly on my mother's part just 
to dump me at the close to where the turnoff is to

15:41.656 --> 15:50.405
Randolph Field on what we call the Austin Highway. 
It's now 35, 81 I guess. And usually you'd catch a

15:52.767 --> 15:57.491
ride pretty fast. Sometimes you'd have to go 
through Austin. And then you'd have to get

16:00.935 --> 16:02.997
yourself across town. And sometimes you'd get a 
direct. But sometimes, more times than not, you'd

16:05.119 --> 16:08.322
get a direct. And there were some few students and 
veterans who were going home on weekends. And I'd

16:13.052 --> 16:19.904
go out there on a Sunday morning, Sunday, no, I 
guess usually on a Sunday afternoon if I went home.

16:19.924 --> 16:21.326
As I said, I didn't go home very much. That was more 
later that I started going home a little more. But I

16:26.435 --> 16:31.503
preferred to hitchhike because it was more 
efficient and saved that little bit of money. You

16:31.523 --> 16:33.887
said some interesting experiences hitchhiking. 
Oh, one time I got with, coming out of San Antonio, I

16:33.935 --> 17:02.052
got with a guy who was, I sort of hoped he'd let me 
drive, he was drinking while he was taking slugs

16:33.935 --> 17:02.052
from the, he had a girlfriend over there, and I 
somehow got out of that, he was going to take me

16:33.935 --> 17:02.052
further, but I used some excuse, I had to get off or 
something, but most of the time it was favorable,

16:33.935 --> 17:02.052
you met people who were interesting, and But as I 
said, it was the way to go. You

17:05.438 --> 17:13.265
never had anybody attempt anything? No. I have not 
yet had a single negative experience. This was the

17:16.548 --> 17:18.670
only thing the guy was drinking, like that. I mean, 
he was just a drunk. That's all I've said. And I

17:21.133 --> 17:22.694
discovered that pretty soon. And as I said, I got 
out of it. But I think all the other occasions were

17:24.636 --> 17:27.358
positive. Later on, I guess as I became a junior or 
senior, I

17:32.457 --> 17:46.771
made connections with another student from the 
general area who had a car and went home often and

17:32.457 --> 17:46.771
I'd share gas and ink cost or something with him. 
But hitchhiking was the way to go. That first

17:51.395 --> 17:54.638
semester, your grades, how'd you do? I did pretty 
well. I think I got, as I said, I exempted I don't

17:59.710 --> 18:00.170
know. I haven't looked at my transcript. I made 
mostly A's and B's, maybe one or two C's. Did you

18:05.295 --> 18:08.178
think about ever going home, quitting, dropping 
out? All the time. But I couldn't. I mean, that was

18:10.280 --> 18:11.942
my darn decision. You know, if my parents had said, 
you must go to A&M, I'm sure I would have quit. But,

18:17.387 --> 18:19.329
you know, they tried to talk me out of it. I mean, 
they didn't want me not to go to college. They said,

18:21.091 --> 18:22.672
why don't you go to junior college? There was San 
Antonio Junior College. Take you two years there,

18:24.734 --> 18:27.557
and then you still want to go on, you know. you know 
still could stay on home on the farm and you know I

18:27.875 --> 18:57.173
was the only son and I guess in the back they had 
maybe hoped that I'd take over the operation but I

18:27.875 --> 18:57.173
didn't see too much future there but no I quitting 
was but I I finally just made the resolve I mean

18:27.875 --> 18:57.173
things got very bad many times it was not for the 
academics I enjoyed the academics but the core

18:27.875 --> 18:57.173
thing got pretty bad and I did you know think many 
times that you know I could understand why others

18:27.875 --> 18:57.173
quit but I kept resolving

19:03.143 --> 19:09.309
Did you and your buddies ever attempt any pranks on 
upperclassmen when you were a freshman? Some of my

19:10.690 --> 19:11.911
colleagues did. I did everything to avoid 
trouble. I mean, there was enough trouble coming

19:15.314 --> 19:18.958
your way without looking for it. But there was a lot 
of that going on. And as I said, I had to work. Those

19:24.043 --> 19:27.906
that didn't have to work, I guess, had more time for 
those kind of things. Do you remember... even in

19:30.295 --> 19:34.339
your outfit or anywhere else, any good bull pranks 
that are worthy of? Yeah, I remember two that were

19:35.140 --> 19:38.563
pretty good. Every once in a while at 
administration, there'd be some hazing problem

19:38.904 --> 19:45.811
erupt in the public. And so there'd be a sudden 
crackdown.

19:50.736 --> 19:55.621
And the biggest fun, I guess, the students had was 
with the KKs. You know the KKs? Campus cops. They

19:58.291 --> 20:02.139
were always pulling pranks on them more than 
anything else. I remember, I don't know which year

20:02.159 --> 20:08.312
this was, but it was one of those cases where they 
were really cracking down on hazing. The windows

20:09.053 --> 20:17.751
were usually open and anybody who walked through 
that area could tell when paddling was going on

20:09.053 --> 20:17.751
just by the sound.

20:19.773 --> 20:21.695
effort to drive, as I said, the K.K.' 's mad by tying 
a pillow on the bedstead or frame of a bed and

20:21.675 --> 20:28.120
paddling it. And they'd come, you know, 
everybody, here they come, you know, type of

20:28.661 --> 20:31.743
thing. And it was not unusual for

20:32.764 --> 20:41.992
where the steps and the windows were arranged on 
the dormitories, if a K.K. came into the building,

20:42.232 --> 20:48.138
he'd have a dump of whole garbage can of water on 
him. And, you know, They'd disappear. Everybody

20:50.088 --> 20:51.090
would disappear. Nobody knew anything. And there 
was this solidarity of not ratting was a big one

20:52.552 --> 20:58.460
when something like that happened. Another, 
well, this wasn't a prank, but it was an indication

20:58.921 --> 21:05.610
of the esteem in which the students had for the KKs. 
This is a true story. We had one of the guys in the

21:08.474 --> 21:11.599
unit who was a real cowboy. And apparently, he came 
from a fairly well-to-do family, and he could

21:12.981 --> 21:18.889
afford to keep a horse down here. And he had a 
Cadillac, a brand new Cadillac with a trailer

21:19.595 --> 21:26.126
hitch and he pulled his horse around and 
everything. And he came to class one day really

21:26.146 --> 21:32.696
upset that he had gotten a ticket, a parking 
ticket. And what he had done, he had bought a new

21:32.716 --> 21:39.207
rope, and new ropes are pretty stiff. So what he did 
in the parking lot, wherever he parked, he tied the

21:39.828 --> 21:51.399
one end to a tree and the other end to the car and 
pulled it tight to make it stretch overnight. And

21:51.419 --> 21:58.726
the ticket didn't specify what it was for, so he, 
you know, he went, they called the arresting, the

21:51.419 --> 21:58.726
ticketing officer in. He said, well, he assumed 
the car just didn't have any brakes. He had to take

22:00.888 --> 22:03.210
it. I don't know if that story was true, but it was 
sort of the, an indication of what the what the

22:08.043 --> 22:11.147
students thought about the KKs at those days. In 
your outfit, now listen, did your outfit have a

22:11.647 --> 22:14.671
nickname? You asked me that. Oh, I can't remember. 
I can't remember. In your outfit, did anybody ever

22:18.575 --> 22:31.650
do any unusual, play any unusual good bull tricks 
at mealtime on some software? Oh, I can't

22:31.811 --> 22:33.092
remember. I know one thing that occasionally 
happened in the That's always the food fights. I

22:38.135 --> 22:43.385
don't know what precipitated those, but people 
just started throwing food at each other, mostly

22:38.135 --> 22:43.385
biscuits and stuff like that. Who had to clean up? I 
don't know. You fish didn't have to clean that up?

22:48.715 --> 22:52.201
No, not such, but a lot of Aggies worked as waiters. 
All the waiters were. And a lot of the other work was

22:54.025 --> 22:57.291
done by students. I mean, employment was given up. 
All the waiters were students, which was a pretty

22:58.752 --> 23:05.363
good job because you'd only work about 40 minutes 
three times a day and you'd have to eat anyway. But

23:07.005 --> 23:14.998
there were students used for janitorial purposes 
and all of that all over. So it was sort of the policy

23:15.078 --> 23:20.427
of the university was to give opportunities. I 
think that grew out of the Depression years with

23:20.507 --> 23:23.832
the project houses and all that. As far as you knew, 
what were the best jobs for a student on campus?

23:28.663 --> 23:29.064
What were they? Well, as I implied earlier, I got 
very, very lucky the second year. In the sophomore

23:39.119 --> 23:41.403
year, of course, I'd learned my way around. But I 
still knew, and I didn't want, as I said, I didn't

23:41.964 --> 23:48.474
want to get into the hazing of freshmen as I had been 
hazed. And I... resolved to minimize my core

23:52.178 --> 23:55.862
activities to the extent possible. I have to 
indicate one thing that happened that second year

23:56.442 --> 24:02.889
is that there was a huge increase in enrollment. We 
had to triple up in the dormitory rooms which were

24:03.790 --> 24:08.575
big enough for two. They actually put another cop, 
three deckers, in rooms and it was very

24:09.155 --> 24:20.447
unsatisfactory because you know when you're two 
in a room or two people together, if you don't want

24:09.155 --> 24:20.447
to have conversation, you just don't 
participate, you just don't do anything, but if

24:20.866 --> 24:26.853
your two roommates do, you know. It was not a very 
good arrangement, and I had to get out of that, I

24:26.873 --> 24:41.989
mean, and I started looking, the minute I came back 
on my second year of my sophomore year, I started

24:26.873 --> 24:41.989
looking for a job, and I stumbled into the Cushing 
Library, and I got a job. And that was the happiest

24:42.189 --> 24:45.373
thing that ever happened to me, or the best thing 
that ever happened to me. How did that come about? I

24:46.694 --> 24:49.337
just was looking for a job. Did you go over to the 
library and ask? Yeah, I just walked up and asked.

24:54.294 --> 24:57.457
Because I knew there were some students working 
there, and I had no idea. I guess I probably learned

24:57.477 --> 25:01.982
that this was a good situation, but I wasn't too 
hopeful. But I was hired right away and stayed here

25:02.382 --> 25:09.950
the next three years, working in the library. 
Doing what? Well, you started off at the very

25:11.152 --> 25:13.014
bottom. In those days, students did not have 
access to the stacks. On the second floor of the old

25:19.675 --> 25:38.192
library, Cushing Library, there was a big desk, 
and there were usually a senior, not a senior

25:19.675 --> 25:38.192
person, but a regular employee operating the desk 
with the help of, depending on the time of day,

25:19.675 --> 25:38.192
three or four student help. And you could work 
during the day according to your schedule, or at

25:38.212 --> 25:41.976
night, or whatever. And what the students would 
do, would look up the book they'd want, and you'd

25:41.996 --> 25:47.961
fill out a card with a reference, and you'd run 
down, stacks to either run the elevator or usually

25:48.194 --> 25:53.580
go and put, get the book, check it out to them, and 
that's what you did. That was the lowest. But you

25:55.923 --> 25:57.985
could even there get breaks to study. I mean, you 
didn't have any book breaks, you know, that type of

25:58.185 --> 26:00.828
thing. And the, you worked your way up. And I think 
by my second and third year, I got to, in the reading

26:07.376 --> 26:13.282
room, they had the reserve show. And somebody had 
to operate the reserve books. Mm-hmm. And that was

26:17.843 --> 26:28.262
a wonderful job because usually in the evening or 
in the afternoons, I put most of my time in on

26:17.843 --> 26:28.262
weekends. I worked every time I could on Saturdays 
and Sundays. You'd have a flurry of activity at the

26:31.267 --> 26:36.817
beginning of a period, like 7 o'clock, and then 10 
or 11, turning it in. But in between, it was pretty

26:37.177 --> 26:38.920
slow. Nobody there to bother you. And you could 
really study, and that was the wonderful thing

26:41.705 --> 26:44.851
about it. And I think the other thing that I really 
appreciated about working in the library, I

26:44.871 --> 26:51.202
learned how to use the library. Who was the 
librarian in those days? Tommy Mayo? Was he still

26:56.151 --> 26:57.373
around? Give me another name. I had very little 
contact with him. I don't know. I do have one. I do

27:03.794 --> 27:06.577
have a story about one of the incidences. Please 
do. There was a Dr. Potter, I believe was his name,

27:07.278 --> 27:20.791
in zoology, or zoology somewhere, and he produced 
tomes, I mean, big textbooks, and he did his

27:07.278 --> 27:20.791
research. And the routine at the library was, this 
was when I was still working the stacks, was that

27:21.372 --> 27:32.383
about, I think the library closed at 10 or 11, 
whatever it was, and about 20 minutes before,

27:33.173 --> 27:42.586
graduate students and faculty members had access 
to the stacks, and a lot of them did their research

27:33.173 --> 27:42.586
and they'd get off to a corner near the books that 
they wanted and do their research. Well, it may

27:42.626 --> 27:45.931
have been Mayo, but I don't know. It was the library 
head at the time. It wasn't him. It was somebody

27:49.796 --> 27:50.477
else. But anyway, I didn't know of Dr. Potter's 
reputation, but anyway, I came through. Our job

27:56.606 --> 27:57.527
was to

28:05.270 --> 28:13.340
And I went through and did my, what were they, 11 or 
12 stacks, you know, you went through the whole

28:05.270 --> 28:13.340
thing warning people. Then you'd come back and 
shut the light, check to see where anybody was. And

28:17.686 --> 28:22.232
I went back a second time, and he was gone, so I put 
the lights out. They had to hold me put out manually

28:22.532 --> 28:27.759
and report it up to the supervisor that took care of 
it. But I didn't know, Dr. Potter wanted to work a

28:28.099 --> 28:31.243
little longer. And as soon as I left, he put the 
lights back on and kept working. And about 2 or 3

28:36.863 --> 28:40.848
a.m., he decided he was ready to quit. He couldn't 
get out of the building. And he called the head

28:43.051 --> 28:46.776
librarian to let him out. And I was told that story 
the next day, and I thought, you know, I'm going to

28:46.796 --> 28:50.901
be fired, right? And I mean, I think it was the head 
librarian. I can't remember the name. Anyway, he

28:56.669 --> 28:58.972
was very somber about it, you know. And I said, you 
know... I thought the least I'd get by with would be

29:01.683 --> 29:06.068
a lawsome job hanging after that. Anyway, he 
chewed me out. Then after that, he laughed. He

29:10.532 --> 29:15.617
said, this had happened before, more than once. 
They thought they wanted to just give him a key.

29:18.180 --> 29:19.401
Anyway, that was an NRA. But as I said, the 
wonderful thing was, particularly in my master's

29:19.421 --> 29:30.913
and doctorate program, I could use the library 
like nobody else because I knew where things were

29:19.421 --> 29:30.913
and how to use it and everything. And the library 
must have been almost a sanctuary for the whole

29:31.012 --> 29:37.578
campus. Oh, yeah, yeah. But I think, again, 
students didn't use it so much as they should have.

29:46.266 --> 29:53.994
I think, like the reserve thing was used because 
there were firm assignments made, you know, read

29:46.266 --> 29:53.994
this and so on, publish a book and so forth. But 
students just going to the library to go to the

29:54.574 --> 29:59.719
library, I mean, that was sort of... But they also 
did not misuse it. No, no. They didn't. They

30:04.397 --> 30:05.358
misrespected it. No mischief in the library. No, 
no. And the reading room was quiet. You could hear a

30:09.462 --> 30:10.583
pin drop. And occasionally, did a student slump 
over the table and go to sleep? Oh, yeah. And I guess

30:17.070 --> 30:18.231
that's where corporate. You had to get some sleep 
somewhere. And it was hard to stay. I mean, as I

30:21.054 --> 30:27.040
said, particularly when they roused you up at 
night to do some foolish thing. sleep was just the

30:27.712 --> 30:30.196
most precious commodity there was. A lot of 
classes, students just could not stay awake. To

30:34.602 --> 30:40.891
me, that was the worst aspect of the core life, was 
the fact that you just never had enough sleep.

30:40.911 --> 30:45.318
Never had enough sleep, and you'd see people 
stretched out wherever they could. Right, now

30:45.378 --> 30:48.062
we're about to finish this first tape. Describe 
your feelings as you go home at the end of that

30:48.563 --> 30:52.569
freshman year. Well, relief that I survived. 
great relief that I survived, and a commitment to

30:57.783 --> 31:04.473
go back and try to do better next time. And as I said, 
my feeling about the Corps was that although these

31:04.513 --> 31:15.428
things were done to me, I was resolved I would never 
be a party to them. And I never, as I said, never once

31:15.528 --> 31:19.494
picked up the paddle against anybody. I avoided 
it. They'd happen, other than my colleagues did,

31:20.736 --> 31:23.920
but I didn't. And I avoided it, somehow avoided it 
completely.
