00:02.579 --> 00:08.025
It's a lot of small things that finally add up to 
make any difference. For example, I used to teach

00:08.045 --> 00:11.749
in OCS and also up in the military academy. For 
example, you go to a mess hall and you see where the

00:13.170 --> 00:19.857
lines stand. Usually they're waiting to go in. 
It's open because they're hungry. And you look

00:23.861 --> 00:26.944
around and you see cigarette butts all over the 
ground. One would conclude, now this is probably a

00:31.790 --> 00:35.515
undisciplined unit. No, that's not it. You can 
take that same unit without beating them over the

00:37.318 --> 00:42.485
head and put butt cans along the way. And you'll 
find that that same unit would use those butt cans

00:43.367 --> 00:49.716
because they know they themselves have to go 
around and pick up the cigarette. So most of the

00:50.577 --> 01:00.531
deficiencies and decrepancies in the unit is 
because the leader, supposed to be a leader,

00:50.577 --> 01:00.531
doesn't anticipate and doesn't think and doesn't 
support his men, doesn't make life easier for

01:01.338 --> 01:04.722
them. If you do that, they feel obligated to do 
something for you. And if you never get them to

01:08.027 --> 01:17.940
where they feel obligated, you know, cooperate 
and not let you down, not let the fellow men down

01:08.027 --> 01:17.940
appear or disappear. Now, we're talking about 
this right now, and I'd like to get on this topic,

01:18.440 --> 01:22.426
and that is leadership. In a sense, now, you're 
defining leadership for me. Is that right? Well,

01:27.106 --> 01:29.970
I'm describing it. You're talking about 
anticipation. Would you define it for me? Well, of

01:37.440 --> 01:44.329
course, simplicity of leadership is influencing 
others. And what values do you think that a leader

01:44.349 --> 01:47.434
should have? What values? What values? You've 
already mentioned high moral values.

01:57.430 --> 01:59.252
And integrity, you mentioned that, too. Well, of 
course, I'm not going to tick off all of the

02:00.753 --> 02:09.682
qualities of the leader, you know, which 
integrity, and all the other things, and loyalty.

02:09.722 --> 02:23.335
Loyal also, by the way,

02:09.722 --> 02:23.335
is to your superiors as well as even more so to your 
subordinates. Now we get into an area, and this is

02:23.575 --> 02:25.817
very interesting, When are you a chronic or 
consistent yes guy?

02:33.848 --> 02:38.092
Or do you have the courage or your conviction to 
disagree? Of course, now we're describing

02:38.112 --> 02:39.973
judgment. You're being disloyal if you know full 
well that whatever he said or plans to do is wrong.

02:46.719 --> 02:48.200
If you let him go ahead and do it. So then in the case 
of a judgment, you've got to go in and maybe by

02:49.842 --> 02:55.787
yourself close the door and say this is what the 
situation is. You're making a big mistake. And

03:00.504 --> 03:03.488
it's just not my opinion, because I know what the 
situation is. And if he said, and you listened to

03:04.629 --> 03:08.253
him, and he said, well, I considered all of that.

03:11.477 --> 03:12.599
But I know what I'm doing. You could even go so far as 
to say, would you mind if we go together to the next

03:14.721 --> 03:20.448
station line and discuss this? Because I don't 
want to put you on the spot. And many of them will

03:24.432 --> 03:26.635
say, yeah, come on, let's go. It all depends on the 
rapport you have, and you have to cultivate that.

03:32.021 --> 03:34.645
You just don't all at once go in and disagree with 
somebody. Now, you're not brown-nosing at all to

03:35.707 --> 03:38.292
do that. That's the way to do business. I do that to 
anybody. I do that to my friend.

03:46.647 --> 03:48.169
But many people won't do that. First, they start 
picking a fight with a superior headquarters.

03:53.935 --> 04:01.362
Maybe they haven't got the guts to pick it with a 
commanding officer, but they'll pick it with a

03:53.935 --> 04:01.362
staff because he outranks them and gives them a 
hard time. In other words, you just develop an

04:03.104 --> 04:06.947
environment that is not very healthy.

04:11.031 --> 04:21.681
So we could go on and on on many things about 
accomplishing

04:11.031 --> 04:21.681
an objective, particularly in a military unit. 
And you have to constantly work at it. You never get

04:24.225 --> 04:29.670
to the unit, you know, well, I've got it where I want 
it now, and I can relax. You're always trying to

04:29.690 --> 04:33.214
improve while harassing. Now, I went out with a 
commanding officer of mine, I'm not going to

04:34.895 --> 04:39.500
mention it, at Christmas time. The way that I had 
already been trained, the time that you go around

04:41.402 --> 04:49.710
and inspect the mess and buck them up and 
discipline them, It's not on Christmas Day or

04:50.450 --> 04:56.098
Thanksgiving Day, but it's either before or some 
other time. Because those guys get up real early,

04:57.300 --> 05:02.026
you know, and they've been working and they've got 
to decorate the dining hall. Well, I was so

05:02.146 --> 05:07.013
embarrassed because I went around with a 
commanding officer, and I was with him. I found an

05:07.173 --> 05:08.976
excuse if I'd known that. It was on Christmas 
morning. He went in there and he started raising

05:12.942 --> 05:20.372
hell, first because somebody was delayed in 
calling attention, and Then he didn't like the way

05:21.601 --> 05:24.484
the tables decorated. He checked out the kitchen. 
And he didn't like what he saw there. He didn't like

05:29.490 --> 05:30.932
the way they was cooking. And he proceeded to line 
them all up and really chew them out. And as we

05:36.599 --> 05:41.544
walked out, I looked back around at them, and they 
were astounded, amazing. Kind of looked at each

05:41.564 --> 05:44.468
other, what in the world happened here. They were 
very proud of everything that they were doing.

05:48.179 --> 05:56.129
Now, he had an artillery background, so I'll say 
the infantry just, they suffer together, and they

05:48.179 --> 05:56.129
have a little bit more compassion. Now, I would do 
the same thing that he did, but I would have done it

05:56.529 --> 06:09.225
either the day before or the day after, but mainly 
before, so that you know what to expect. Now, a

06:10.100 --> 06:14.466
battle group commander or battalion commander, 
they're closer to the troops. He may not hit that

06:15.107 --> 06:20.414
mess for another year or maybe even more than that, 
since he's got many men.

06:23.739 --> 06:25.941
So he doesn't really build the morale of that. He 
doesn't discipline that unit. They just feel

06:28.705 --> 06:33.712
frustrated, and this is a hell of a way to do it. And 
they'll think about it the rest of the day. You fall

06:36.215 --> 06:39.600
there a day, and it's Christmas. They should be 
complimented for having gotten up early and

06:39.800 --> 06:44.745
everything they're doing. Do you think that 
people in the military get ahead the same way as

06:45.586 --> 06:52.654
people in professional or business life? I think 
it's a great similarity, though, in many cases.

06:59.301 --> 07:00.222
What are the differences? Now you're almost 
talking about this book, What Makes Sammy Run. Did

07:05.088 --> 07:08.271
you ever read that book years ago about this guy who 
who studied every situation and can exploit it and

07:08.943 --> 07:17.291
exploit people and go to the top. I think it 
probably happens. There are a lot of

07:18.652 --> 07:31.103
similarities, but the objectives are a little bit 
different, because one is personal gain, and that

07:18.652 --> 07:31.103
may occur in the military in most of the cases. But 
to a lesser extent, are you saying? Yeah. The thing

07:33.465 --> 07:38.410
that many people don't understand, civilians I'm 
talking about, is that the only objective of

07:40.735 --> 07:54.130
having a military establishment is to win in case 
we have war, to save lives and have the equipment,

07:40.735 --> 07:54.130
so forth. We're faced with that. Of course, the 
other mission, the main mission, is to, that I

07:55.832 --> 08:08.346
certainly believe in, and most people, that arms 
secure peace,

07:55.832 --> 08:08.346
that strength will deter war. Weakness will 
invite war. So you have to be strong in peacetime.

08:16.814 --> 08:22.222
You can't wait, like we did in Korea, until we get 
involved in the fight and play catch up. Or like we

08:22.242 --> 08:25.567
really did in Vietnam, the same way, although we 
had the ability. So you work longer hours. You make

08:32.077 --> 08:33.519
more sacrifices. The family makes the 
sacrifices, just like your wife is sacrificing.

08:37.345 --> 08:38.687
That's because you're gone all the time. And she's 
working. That's one thing. But they have to raise

08:42.301 --> 08:47.187
the children, hardship, get their furniture 
lost, broken. In other words, that's really

08:48.008 --> 08:49.711
rough. So in other words, you have to sacrifice 
more climbing in the military leadership

08:49.731 --> 08:57.601
positions than you do in the business, you think? I 
don't think I would describe my advancement as

08:57.621 --> 09:03.828
climbing. I think you do things like you think they 
should be done. And that will follow. I never in my

09:09.667 --> 09:21.583
mind ever said, now I think, now I won't contradict 
myself, I wanted to go to the Army War College

09:09.667 --> 09:21.583
because that would be climbing, that would be 
advancement, I know that's what you had in mind,

09:09.667 --> 09:21.583
that's climbing. But I never considered if I did 
this, then I would look good to the superior and I

09:23.526 --> 09:33.739
would win brownie points. Now in the Army right 
now, In fact, there was a book written about this,

09:36.346 --> 09:42.853
and the Army has been reacting to that book for 
quite some time. That is that we have ruined the

09:42.873 --> 09:57.869
Army office structure because we put such 
emphasis on gaining brownie points that we don't

09:42.873 --> 09:57.869
look at our unit like I just described. We only do 
the things that we will look good and to hell with

09:57.909 --> 10:01.753
the other guy. Of course, we would like to look like 
we didn't do it that way But we're only interested

10:07.278 --> 10:11.063
in our own personal advancement. And we're only 
looking for the jobs that will help us. Well, do you

10:14.988 --> 10:17.791
think there's any validity? Well, it all depends 
on the individual. Oh, it depends on the

10:20.315 --> 10:21.536
individual. Yeah. Well, would you have 
considered yourself ambitious? Yeah.

10:29.647 --> 10:30.628
Because I wanted to excel. I wanted as far as I can 
remember. even in a selfish way. I wanted to excel

10:37.236 --> 10:40.980
in school, but I didn't want to study because I 
wanted to do the other things. As a result, I was

10:41.881 --> 10:45.064
just an average student. I wanted to excel in 
athletics.

10:50.009 --> 10:51.591
I was going to graduate from college. I didn't know 
how, but I was going to do it some way. I mean, by

10:53.953 --> 10:56.977
working and not by cheating, of course. And what 
about in the military? Were you ambitious? You

10:59.319 --> 11:03.323
just said that you never thought about becoming a 
general, yet at the same time, You wanted to excel,

11:03.640 --> 11:05.042
were you ambitious? I wanted to excel, I wanted to 
be...

11:09.667 --> 11:18.557
I wanted to make, I would call that ambitious, 
because I wanted, but I wasn't going to, I didn't

11:09.667 --> 11:18.557
ever attempt to walk over the bodies of somebody 
else to get there. In other words, I never tried to

11:18.577 --> 11:31.892
enhance my, or reflect favorably on somebody at 
the expense of making somebody else, even if it's a

11:18.577 --> 11:31.892
half-truth, you know, like, anything went wrong, 
it's his fault, and... Even though he's claiming

11:32.446 --> 11:36.209
credit, I'm the one behind all this. And some do 
that. And I'm sure they do that in civilian life.

11:40.893 --> 11:41.334
Oh, sure. Okay. There's another issue along these 
lines that I'd like to have you comment on, and that

11:44.477 --> 11:59.129
is that some people maintain that there's a 
military mind, that the military does things a

11:44.477 --> 11:59.129
certain way, which is different than the 
civilians. Do you think that there's a military

11:59.189 --> 12:00.951
mind?

12:03.682 --> 12:07.065
You ask me all sorts of questions that are not 
simple to answer. No, they're not simple at all. To

12:10.288 --> 12:19.017
a civilian, there's a military mind, especially a 
civilian that's never had any experience in the

12:10.288 --> 12:19.017
military. Now, I'm sure your attitude towards a 
military mind would be different than somebody

12:20.518 --> 12:28.926
who's never had any, because you know what 
discipline is. If you've been aboard ship,

12:29.006 --> 12:33.030
everybody's got to pull this job to make it run. And 
they've done a tremendous job. Look at all these

12:37.803 --> 12:47.638
years we've operated nuclear

12:37.803 --> 12:47.638
submarines and carriers with only minor 
accidents. They think they're minor. But you have

12:50.121 --> 12:51.343
to do it right. Look what happened on this carrier 
here recently when they had this terrible

12:51.764 --> 12:58.754
accident with this Aggie, you know, which wasn't 
his fault. I mean, he wasn't on drugs or anything.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.000
He just didn't hit the carrier. So experience 
then, I think, influence whether or not there's a

13:04.899 --> 13:11.969
military mind. Now, I say it's a military mind. 
What is the military mind? Would you define it?

13:15.874 --> 13:27.650
Well, I think it's a disciplined individual

13:15.874 --> 13:27.650
who likes to see things done according to a plan. 
And he makes a plan. Because he doesn't want to get

13:31.617 --> 13:33.619
caught short. He's always thinking ahead. Now 
it's probably called a scenario of what might

13:37.522 --> 13:40.585
happen. What if, in other words. What if this? What 
if that? And he has mentally made a plan in that

13:44.829 --> 13:51.755
situation. So he tries not to ever be surprised, 
whether it's running down the highway or whether

13:51.775 --> 14:00.223
it's in military subjects or whatever it is. or go 
into a movie or play.

14:05.417 --> 14:11.483
Mimi gets mad at me because she says I'm a pessimist 
because I'm always thinking of the things that

14:05.417 --> 14:11.483
might happen. She says, why don't you pause to be an 
optimist? This is a thing that could happen, and

14:17.189 --> 14:21.393
I'm just thinking about now if it would happen, 
what would I do? What could we do? Was it getting a

14:22.334 --> 14:24.977
flat on the road or whatever it is? I'm thinking 
about it. Getting gasoline or running out of

14:25.838 --> 14:28.340
gasoline. So they planned. if he's got a good one. 
We've already talked about patriotism. He's

14:36.070 --> 14:45.940
actually an individual, or you could say he's 
selfless, because he will put principle

14:36.070 --> 14:45.940
above himself.

14:49.163 --> 14:57.852
You hope that he's an honorable individual, just 
like at the military academy and elsewhere, where

14:49.163 --> 14:57.852
you have duty, honor, and country, that he won't 
lie still so that When he says something, you can

14:59.097 --> 15:06.626
take it as being factual, the truth.

15:08.488 --> 15:12.753
So you add those and a lot of other things, and I 
don't have time to think about none. And you see his

15:13.294 --> 15:15.596
style of life. He even attempts to be neat. That is, 
keep his hair relatively cut. I mean, according to

15:23.145 --> 15:27.330
the styles, it's different today. It's close to 
breath. He tried. He wears neat clothes and so

15:30.135 --> 15:32.237
forth. He mowed his yard. I even mowed the vacant 
lot before they built this house over there. I had a

15:37.604 --> 15:39.446
civilian friend up the street. I'm sure he said, 
because of military money, he said, I see you out

15:39.946 --> 15:46.014
there mowing that vacant lot. That's not your lot. 
Why are you doing that? I said, because I can't

15:47.776 --> 15:49.738
stand those weeds. You know, I can't stand it. 
Right up to my line. He thought it was stupid, and

15:53.963 --> 15:55.445
he's right. You know, it only improves. But I 
couldn't have a military mine. They asked me why.

16:00.358 --> 16:01.740
You wanted to see it neat. Yeah. They said, why? You 
sure do keep your jasmine out here. I trim it all the

16:05.603 --> 16:09.427
time, you know, and keep the leaves trimmed out. 
And I have people stop and say, you've got the

16:09.447 --> 16:13.291
neatest looking place ever. I could have said, 
well, it's called a military mine. I just can't

16:15.052 --> 16:17.755
stand to see things that's not orderly. And I think 
that's part of all these years of training, see.

16:22.920 --> 16:23.020
Yeah. I can't stand to see clothes on the floor 
hanging. I hate to see people that have no sense of

16:27.476 --> 16:35.148
value as far as money and things like that go. Now, 
I'm sure others may view me as being queer.

16:43.281 --> 16:45.624
So they could call that a military mind. Also, 
military people don't make good presidents.

16:50.912 --> 16:51.994
Eisenhower didn't. Main reason, because he was a 
guy. First, you know, we had the U-2 flight. And

16:59.023 --> 17:01.746
they said, now, Mr. President, that's a CIA 
flight. There is no reason at all for you to accept

17:02.867 --> 17:06.552
responsibility. You go ahead and tell the world 
that this was, a country did this, and I apologize

17:07.693 --> 17:16.804
for it. But he didn't. He said, absolutely not. I'm 
personally taking the responsibility. In other

17:21.674 --> 17:24.538
words, he didn't try to cover up or evade anything. 
And there are a lot of other things that occurred

17:26.301 --> 17:36.295
during his administration that he did it the way 
that you'd expect a military guy would do. Now, the

17:37.657 --> 17:41.162
reason why they don't make a president is they're 
not flexible enough. I think Reagan would be a good

17:42.364 --> 17:43.986
president. I don't know how flexible it is. We'll 
wait and see. Well, do you think that the military

17:46.686 --> 17:53.594
mind is inflexible, then, by Kenosha? You're 
saying that they're not flexible enough to be a

17:54.615 --> 17:57.939
good politician. No, what I mean is that you've got 
to evade. To be a good politician, it's not to me you

18:03.345 --> 18:06.749
have to be a liar. Lawyers make good politicians. 
Yeah. Because you've got to be able to take a guy you

18:10.093 --> 18:14.158
know damn good well as guilty as hell And you go to 
paint that picture, and you say, well, I'm

18:14.341 --> 18:20.767
defending his rights, you know, that's for him, 
for a fair trial. And you make him out as a good

18:21.488 --> 18:28.615
Samaritan, and that poor innocent woman probably 
raped as a prostitute, you know, and all that sort

18:21.488 --> 18:28.615
of thing. So you try her and find her guilty. Now, a 
politician does well because he can be on one side

18:32.219 --> 18:39.266
one day and one on the other. And you can 
rationalize that. You say, well, things change.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.913
just like Fulbright said, well, I was wrong. But 
the military mentality doesn't work that way. I'm

18:48.298 --> 18:51.322
not sure there's a military mind. I'm trying to 
explain the way that someone who I think is

18:51.382 --> 19:01.755
efficient, the civilian would call that a 
military mind. He's more rigid in his thinking. I

19:03.577 --> 19:04.819
hope I'm not that way. I think I'm broad-minded. 
I'm not one that Also, it changes my mind on things.

19:13.308 --> 19:14.569
There's no question about that.

19:17.752 --> 19:22.256
But I'm just telling you their style of life and 
also the way they approach problems. One would

19:22.276 --> 19:30.944
say, especially if somebody's never had any 
military training,

19:22.276 --> 19:30.944
that you seem to have a military mind. Now, when 
they say a military mind, what they mean is they're

19:30.964 --> 19:38.871
rigid and blind to the realities of life. They live 
in an entirely different world. Why don't they get

19:41.526 --> 19:47.495
out here to the real world where we are? What do you 
think? And I don't think Maxwell Taylor, for

19:47.975 --> 19:53.844
example, has a military mind at all. Even though 
he's really everything I described, that

19:53.864 --> 20:00.834
describes Maxwell Taylor.

20:00.854 --> 20:05.280
I don't think good pastor, who was the 
superintendent of the military academy, he's

20:06.593 --> 20:09.417
another real intellectual we have in the 
military. You know, he's a Ph.D., and he's

20:09.458 --> 20:21.637
a patent, probably, is what the civilians would 
call the military mind. Okay. Now, for the final

20:21.777 --> 20:29.729
topic of the interview, let's turn to what has 
happened at Texas A&M during the last generation.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.993
Did you know General Oral Rudder? I think I met him 
one time, but I really can't say that I knew him

20:34.488 --> 20:48.285
because he was ahead of me considerably at A&M, and 
I didn't meet him during the war, as I recall. He

20:49.127 --> 20:52.691
might have been at a rally. We had Aggie Mustard and 
Naples during the war. He might have been there at

20:58.839 --> 21:00.341
that time. We got shelled. I was

21:02.753 --> 21:11.944
wondering, during that time, of course, there 
were a number of very important changes. In the

21:13.146 --> 21:14.447
school? In the school at A&M, and one was ending the 
mandatory corps and allowing people to come who do

21:14.467 --> 21:22.277
not want to join the corps of cadets. What's your 
feeling on that? I thought that was a good policy.

21:26.142 --> 21:26.382
Why? Well, because you can't maintain a big school 
like that and have it strictly military.

21:35.706 --> 21:53.384
Certainly, if he hadn't done it when Vietnam came 
along and ROTC got so unpopular,

21:35.706 --> 21:53.384
I think it probably was good for the school, mainly 
because I thought females were good and you don't

21:35.706 --> 21:53.384
want them unless they want to take ROTC. Okay, what 
did you think about his decision to allow women to

21:53.504 --> 21:57.649
come to A&M? I thought that was good also.

22:04.263 --> 22:08.228
See, it's an isolated place, of course, if you 
don't think you live there. We used to hitchhike to

22:09.089 --> 22:12.232
Denton. Mimi attended TSCW. They called it CIA 
there, Denton, Texas. All female schools, so we

22:19.461 --> 22:24.306
sort of adopted each other, you know. They 
supported us going to football games in Dallas and

22:24.326 --> 22:29.733
also at Fort Worth. And we used to hitchhike from 
College Station on weekends. to Dentman by, can

22:34.351 --> 22:36.234
you imagine that? Get up there on Saturday and come 
back on Sunday.

22:41.881 --> 22:53.016
But I think that was a good thing because it's

22:41.881 --> 22:53.016
just healthy and good for female companionship in 
the classroom. But I would certainly like to see a

22:53.037 --> 23:00.747
strong cadet corps and maintain the same 
standards, which I think they have, eliminate

23:01.857 --> 23:16.630
that city hazing, although, I mean, you know, to be 
more mature, certainly we're more mature now than

23:01.857 --> 23:16.630
we were 15 and 20 and 30 years ago, to say May, 
because of the changes with May.

23:18.232 --> 23:22.355
But that's important, because A&M has a national 
reputation. You can go anywhere, and they say,

23:23.176 --> 23:31.003
you're from A&M, and you have some old time, and you 
say, and this isn't just a cliche, but it seems to

23:23.176 --> 23:31.003
be. A&M produced more also in World War II than even 
West Point. And we're proud of that. And our nation

23:39.349 --> 23:43.295
was proud because that was important. We had OCS, 
but here we had somebody that had been trained and

23:45.418 --> 23:49.665
was part of the training. And they all did an 
outstanding job, far as I know.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.421
And it's good for them to carry on that tradition. 
And I hope that there is friction between the Corps

24:00.262 --> 24:06.750
cadets and the non-military.

24:10.235 --> 24:14.040
See, after World War II, we had a lot of veterans. 
And they made real fine students. Of course, they

24:18.105 --> 24:19.486
were mature and married. Most of them, boy, they 
were ready to get on with their life. I

24:21.769 --> 24:28.598
would like to see us a strong Corps. with all of the 
traditions, Leslie, hazing. What about allowing

24:32.561 --> 24:39.009
the decision to integrate the school and allow 
blinds into Texas A&M? What was your opinion of

24:39.029 --> 24:40.431
that? Oh, great.

24:43.876 --> 24:50.564
But I was in hope that maybe we would phase out 
Prairie View when that occurred, but I can see now

24:43.876 --> 24:50.564
where that's not going to be possible. Either 
you've got to really support it or phase it out. By

24:56.752 --> 24:58.855
support, I mean adequate buildings. But if they 
breach the capacity, like we say now, they

25:00.185 --> 25:07.413
probably will need Prairie View as an overflow, 
certainly for the black. Because they raise the

25:08.935 --> 25:11.018
interest standard and so forth. You're going to 
eliminate some people that normally would be

25:11.038 --> 25:15.243
coming in. And as a corollary, I was wondering what 
you thought about the draft. What's your opinion,

25:19.908 --> 25:30.040
which this doesn't have to do with A&M, but what's 
your opinion as far as reinstituting the draft in

25:19.908 --> 25:30.040
the United States? Of course, I think it should be 
reinstituted, but I don't think now is the time,

25:30.678 --> 25:36.807
mainly because of the mood of the country. Now, if 
Reagan can continue to be popular or have the

25:36.827 --> 25:46.983
respect and the support of the nation and 
Congress, then perhaps he can do it. But now, I'm

25:47.223 --> 25:58.440
saying, after this forgiving of the draft dodgers 
and that other, I think you'll have turmoil, but

25:47.223 --> 25:58.440
certainly we should consider continuing 
registration. You've heard this so much over and

25:58.606 --> 26:03.331
over. It's not the active duty forces that need to 
draft. It's the reserve. You've got to build up a

26:10.058 --> 26:17.426
train, a reservoir of trained people as 
individual replacement. And we don't have it.

26:18.227 --> 26:19.408
That's what the draft produces. Because you know 
you're drafted, you do your active duty training,

26:19.608 --> 26:27.617
then you're carried for four years, I guess, or 
five years as a inactive reserve and you're

26:28.120 --> 26:56.794
subject to call and we have exercises used to 
practicing it's good easy to do that with

26:28.120 --> 26:56.794
computers calling up providing they keep their 
their residents up to date in the computer

26:28.120 --> 26:56.794
practice calling them in calling them up and you 
say but without the draft i don't know how we're

26:28.120 --> 26:56.794
ever going to have an adequate reserve

26:28.120 --> 26:56.794
and that's that's because We've got to be able to 
replace casuals in Europe. And they're going to be

27:02.746 --> 27:03.727
heavy.

27:07.371 --> 27:09.314
And I don't know how we're going to do it. I don't 
know how in the world. What about drafting women?

27:12.197 --> 27:14.439
What's your opinion toward that? We get all the 
females we want without the draft. Why draft

27:18.944 --> 27:20.406
people you don't need? Well, you say, well, why 
don't you put it on the books and not use it? Maybe

27:24.551 --> 27:25.752
something like that. in the case of all that war, 
would we want to, but I don't know. What about your

27:30.798 --> 27:33.342
idea of women in combat roles? No. Why not? It's 
just, it's too dirty and suffering, and we, this

27:37.067 --> 27:49.365
would be a hell of a nation, and we're reaching that 
point with this unisex approach to life. If we have

27:50.146 --> 27:55.975
to rely on our female population to go out, I just 
can't see them in the, And war is such a dirty,

27:57.794 --> 28:00.437
terrible thing. Women ministrate that they need 
to bathe.

28:07.866 --> 28:09.789
They could never have fought in Italy then. And I 
wouldn't want them to, aside now from the sex part

28:10.489 --> 28:14.735
of it. You know, that's one of the big problems now. 
The gals get pregnant. And they have children. And

28:25.588 --> 28:26.569
they marry soldiers. In Europe right now, one of 
our big problems is if we really alerted and moved

28:27.443 --> 28:37.854
out, what will they do with all those children? The 
wife can't go because who's going to take care of

28:37.874 --> 28:40.296
the kids? Well, you say, well, she has to because 
she's a key man in our communication unit. So we're

28:45.502 --> 28:55.232
kidding ourselves if we think we can move out on a 
total alert and go somewhere in Europe and not have

28:45.502 --> 28:55.232
all sorts of problems of manning. Plus the women 
get pregnant. As I just said, they can't lift heavy

28:58.493 --> 29:01.899
objects after a while. Some of the women are small 
and can't lift it anyway. So you have to have a man

29:04.763 --> 29:10.353
come along to supplement or to do the job. So where 
are you going to use them? In combat, you've got to

29:11.635 --> 29:16.463
carry heavy loads, even throw you an instrument. 
And your feet hurt. I just don't see any place.

29:20.650 --> 29:21.852
They're not needed anyways.

29:25.088 --> 29:27.651
So why would we draft and use women? We've got too 
many right now. See, support units have to fight

29:29.774 --> 29:31.776
also. Peace time, it's all simple because the 
other man comes and helps them. But in peace time,

29:36.802 --> 29:42.169
it's wet, you're muddy, you're sick, you're 
scared.

29:44.992 --> 29:54.724
And you're going to find men, unless we change and 
all get to be homosexuals, which looks like we're

29:44.992 --> 29:54.724
going to be lesbians and homosexuals or bisexuals 
sooner or later. There's still a difference in the

29:55.632 --> 30:02.661
man and the woman, and that difference is not 
needed on the battlefield. I don't even agree with

30:02.981 --> 30:05.324
a gal being a fighter pilot. It's true she can go 
fight and hopefully she comes back and lands. But

30:08.889 --> 30:10.651
I'd hate to see her go to prison. What would they do 
like they did in Vietnam for eight and ten years? Of

30:14.576 --> 30:15.858
course, they'll use them for sex. They'd do it 
practically every war they ever had, just like we

30:15.898 --> 30:21.285
talked about there. The German Jews, the Jewish 
women, the good-looking, they all kept them out

30:22.244 --> 30:30.633
for sex.

30:30.653 --> 30:42.427
Now, overall, do you think that the changes back to 
A&M now, do you think that the changes during those

30:30.653 --> 30:42.427
1960s, do you think that that made A&M a better 
institution or not?

30:48.293 --> 30:48.994
I think so. that certainly made them like all other 
institutions. It's no longer unique. We used to be

30:55.103 --> 31:03.291
proud of being really the largest military 
installation in the United States. Or in some

31:04.853 --> 31:06.755
cases, the world, I've said. Maybe that's our own 
propaganda. And it was really fine school. Of

31:13.742 --> 31:15.784
course, the school was much better now than it was 
then. And we had a lot of instructors. They had no

31:19.265 --> 31:23.569
more than a master's degree, for example. And as I 
read my alumni magazines, we really got some

31:23.589 --> 31:35.059
top-notch people like you, for example, that have 
come from other states and not have just a bunch of

31:23.589 --> 31:35.059
texts. And that's inbreeding. And that's one 
reason we don't speak very good English is because

31:36.240 --> 31:45.048
of our teachers in high school later on. They spoke 
funny just like we did. And they're supposed to be

31:48.290 --> 31:49.592
teaching them. Like when Mimi went on up to Denton, 
she had a real good speech teacher. And she took

31:55.799 --> 31:57.141
that as an elective. But the teacher was shocked. 
Where in the world did you girls go to school?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.371
So that's good to have. Jefferson came from your 
country. He was a dean, as we talked about earlier.

32:13.461 --> 32:15.023
And he was good for anything. And he was one of the 
pioneers, along with Dean Kyle. Of course, he was a

32:20.576 --> 32:22.198
local product. So we don't want inbreeding at all. 
We want outside. It's a much better school

32:26.642 --> 32:30.766
academically.

32:33.228 --> 32:44.959
And I'd rather trade off this military value for 
academic excellence than be hard-headed and say,

32:33.228 --> 32:44.959
well, even though they're not going to be 
professional soldiers, make everybody take

32:45.462 --> 32:47.545
ROTC.

32:50.049 --> 32:54.876
Now, I'm not in favor of females being in the band 
just because the band doesn't have a female.

32:56.878 --> 33:01.145
That's the national reputation of that band, just 
perfection. They even look better on TV as a dozen

33:02.607 --> 33:07.093
persons, if you see that. It's beautiful. And why 
have a female in there just because she wasn't

33:08.615 --> 33:12.881
supposed to be? I don't know. What was the result of 
that lawsuit? We're still in court. Of course, it

33:18.422 --> 33:19.784
won't ruin the band. It won't be the end of the world 
if that's the case. But I hope they all are

33:21.806 --> 33:29.636
generally the size of the mail so we don't end up 
having a bunch of little.

33:31.378 --> 33:32.339
I'm out of questions. And we've covered your early 
life and your education and career. And I was

33:37.665 --> 33:41.109
wondering your ideas about leadership in A&M. I 
was wondering if there was anything else that Do

33:45.537 --> 33:58.217
you think that we should, anything else that was 
important in your career, that we should talk

33:45.537 --> 33:58.217
about, or have we done, sort of covered the water 
part? I don't think we've talked too much about

33:58.437 --> 34:04.005
everything. Okay, well. Does that gal, when she 
types it up, does she edit it, get all the

34:04.526 --> 34:09.113
grammatical errors out of it? Oh, I'll end the 
interview.
