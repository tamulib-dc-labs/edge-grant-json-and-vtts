This is an interview with Steve Lambert by Matt 
Vogel on November 25th, 1988 at Gulf Coast Sailing

00:03.170 --> 00:12.180
Center in Clear Lake Shores, Texas. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge about the

00:13.181 --> 00:23.953
Vietnam War, I am going to donate this tape to Texas 
A&M Oral History Collection and the University

00:13.181 --> 00:23.953
Archives. Is that all right with you, Steve? Fine. 
Thank you very much. Steve, we'll first start off

00:27.577 --> 00:30.460
with when and where were you born? I was born in 
Houston, Texas, December the 8th, 1950. And where

00:36.252 --> 00:37.614
were you raised up? I was raised in Houston through 
most of my life, and then actually moved to

00:37.634 --> 00:47.446
Pasadena in the early 60s. So I went through high 
school in Pasadena area and grew up in Pasadena

00:47.527 --> 00:51.612
through my teenage years. Were any of your 
relatives in the military, and if so, when and

00:53.434 --> 00:57.139
where? Yeah, my father was in the Air Force, went in 
right at the end of World War II and spent some time

00:57.406 --> 01:06.995
in Germany. And then my brother had joined the Air 
Force about a year prior to me being drafted into

01:08.016 --> 01:15.163
the service. And he was in the States most of the 
time, although he did do a tour in Thailand, didn't

01:15.203 --> 01:25.793
actually fly, did ground support services in 
Thailand. What

01:26.752 --> 01:32.578
did you know about the Vietnam War before you 
joined? Not really a whole lot other than what TV

01:32.618 --> 01:37.963
and media had put out. I did very little reading 
about it. Basically, I understood it was a, quote,

01:41.407 --> 01:56.202
conflict and not really a war, and that we were 
there as mediators initially trying to basically

01:41.407 --> 01:56.202
support the local government and You know, also 
the French had stepped in, I understood, and they

01:56.620 --> 02:04.170
were also in that type of a mediator type effect. 
But it became a full-scale war from what we

02:05.852 --> 02:09.517
understood. And, you know, until I actually got 
there and saw what it was, I really didn't know, you

02:09.617 --> 02:17.087
know, what the real thing was. You know, basically 
the media had played it up more than what it really

02:17.168 --> 02:23.356
was at times. And then at times they really didn't 
have the truth thing either. Once you get there you

02:26.926 --> 02:29.989
have to form your own opinion of what you're 
looking at. That leads to one question that I did

02:30.009 --> 02:39.520
forget to write down and that is when did you go to 
high school and when did you go to college? I went to

02:39.800 --> 02:45.406
Sam Rayburn High School in Pasadena, graduated in 
1969. Next year I went to one semester, started

02:45.466 --> 02:55.838
school at the University of Houston and did not 
finish that full semester. And likewise, I was

02:56.054 --> 03:01.720
married and was basically to work full time. And 
therefore, my number got thrown into the lottery

03:02.621 --> 03:06.565
and I was drafted. So if I would have stayed in 
school, I would not have been drafted, probably.

03:11.890 --> 03:13.291
When were you drafted? I was drafted in 1970, or 
actually 69, actually. And shortly, right as soon

03:20.559 --> 03:24.863
as I got out of the... thing that my name 
immediately went in and my number was picked. So I

03:28.912 --> 03:38.325
actually went to my orientation type thing in 
October and November of 69 and went in in 1970. And I

03:38.605 --> 03:44.033
want to say January, February of 70, yeah. Right. 
At what basis were you trained and what type of

03:45.860 --> 03:49.325
training did you receive? Initially, I went into 
the Army. I went to Fort Polk, Louisiana. I went

03:53.271 --> 04:06.973
through what they call their basic training, 
which was more or less a military courtesy type

03:53.271 --> 04:06.973
stuff, your general hand-to-hand combat, 
military weapons training. We were trained on the

04:07.033 --> 04:11.640
M16, light weapons, your hand grenades. your 
first aid, some military tactics and stuff like

04:11.941 --> 04:17.709
that. We had very little other than our normal 
calisthenics, outsource, outdoor type

04:18.550 --> 04:24.999
activities. We did do one overnight stint where we 
basically did a maneuver or a bivouac where we went

04:25.540 --> 04:33.430
out and spent the night in the woods one night. We 
did a lot of marching and running and stuff like

04:33.931 --> 04:40.480
that, but the actual overnight stuff, we only did 
one overnight thing in basic training. By going in

04:40.814 --> 04:48.825
January and February, it was very cold and we 
would, in Louisiana, we did actually snow on us a

04:40.814 --> 04:48.825
couple of times while we were there. So the 
training was done in fairly cold conditions at

04:49.385 --> 04:54.012
that time. And then shortly after that, I was 
tested at the end that I was picked for what they

04:54.032 --> 05:03.765
called AIT or Advanced Infantry Training. And my 
MOS at that time was given me as what was considered

05:04.506 --> 05:09.252
an 11 Bravo. which is infantry. From what I was 
told, my basis was picked because of my answers on

05:12.938 --> 05:21.770
my questionnaire, you know, that they gave me or 
whatever on my testing. And I literally did

05:22.531 --> 05:30.082
battery of testing for probably three or four days 
in a row of all sorts of tests and questions and

05:22.531 --> 05:30.082
stuff like that. And I have a gut feeling I was 
picked mainly because of my experience with guns,

05:30.162 --> 05:37.112
hunting as a kid, fishing, outdoors activities, 
stuff like that, and I answered it truthfully that

05:37.312 --> 05:44.080
I'd done a lot of that, so maybe that's why I was 
picked. I really don't know. There was also a lot of

05:45.341 --> 05:53.430
other people or guys that were picked that had 
never been in the woods in their life or even held a

05:45.341 --> 05:53.430
gun, so I don't know if that was the basis, but it 
might have been. My AIT was spent also in Fort Polk,

05:53.470 --> 05:56.473
Louisiana. It was more along the military tactics 
more weapon handling. What kind of weapons that

06:05.639 --> 06:07.681
were different? Well, we went, stepped up from the 
M16 to the M60, the 20 millimeter, did the pistol,

06:07.741 --> 06:20.334
.45 caliber pistol, did a .50 caliber machine gun. 
We shot a weapon called a wall, which was a light

06:21.155 --> 06:25.299
anti-tank weapon. We got to shoot that a few times. 
got more proficient in the M16, a lot more

06:28.696 --> 06:41.069
different training, not just shooting at fixed 
targets, but moving targets and, you know,

06:28.696 --> 06:41.069
actually moving where you run and shoot and fall 
down or run and shoot and fall down. So more

06:41.149 --> 06:48.016
activity from that standpoint there, but it was 
still strictly a target type thing. AIT, we did two

06:48.497 --> 06:57.166
or three different BIVWACs, but still there was 
not that much overnight training or anything

06:48.497 --> 06:57.166
really jungle warfare or anything that way. It was 
pretty basic straightforward so in other words we

06:58.565 --> 07:16.791
weren't trained to go to Vietnam we were just 
trained in a standard military procedure where we

06:58.565 --> 07:16.791
could have gone anywhere in the world whether it be 
you know Saudi Arabia or Germany or Russia or

06:58.565 --> 07:16.791
wherever you know from that standpoint so there 
was no specific jungle warfare training at that

06:58.565 --> 07:16.791
time. Were you ever taught Vietnamese? No. Did you 
go to any other schools? Well after the AIT I was

07:28.096 --> 07:39.032
elected or picked to go to what I was considered 
shake and bake school or NCO or noncommissioned

07:28.096 --> 07:39.032
officer school where I would become an E5, which is 
a sergeant. When I went home on leave, I expected

07:40.014 --> 07:42.998
that to be my orders. When I returned and my orders 
came in, I was not picked and I was sent to a what they

07:43.038 --> 07:50.910
call tracker school. Initially went in and worked 
with dogs and then I went from there and did visual

07:57.053 --> 07:59.856
tracking. This type of stuff was all done in the 
jungle of Georgia area. We were at Fort Garden and

08:07.163 --> 08:10.467
Fort Benning, Georgia. This was done more in the 
heat of the summer type thing as it progressed

08:12.569 --> 08:18.655
through my training basically. It got a lot 
hotter.

08:22.366 --> 08:29.939
We would spend literally days out in the woods with 
our rucksacks, which were the same thing in

08:22.366 --> 08:29.939
Vietnam. We had Vietnam-issue clothing. We had 
carried M16s, and we were trained basically at

08:32.283 --> 08:39.977
that time more of a jungle warfare type thing. We 
were trained at that time also by veterans from

08:40.017 --> 08:46.568
Vietnam, where in their basic in AIT, there was no 
actual Vietnam veterans. They were your lifers,

08:48.831 --> 08:51.474
if you want to put it that way. They were good men, 
but they were not veterans of Vietnam. They were

08:54.919 --> 09:00.466
strictly your lifer type guys that might have been 
in World War II even, you know, been around

08:54.919 --> 09:00.466
forever. Korean Warfare or something like that. 
We basically learned more or less how to observe

09:03.490 --> 09:11.020
the different movements in the woods and they 
would set up ambushes for us and trip wires, booby

09:11.422 --> 09:21.161
traps, stuff we would actually see in Vietnam 
basically. So this was geared towards Vietnam? So

09:23.465 --> 09:32.282
this was geared directly towards Vietnam and 
tracking and of course at that time I did not have

09:23.465 --> 09:32.282
orders to go to Nam although that's what I was being 
trained for. And this went on for six weeks. And I

09:35.521 --> 09:39.725
would say at least five of the six weeks I was in the 
woods. So it was continuous intensive training in

09:40.486 --> 09:43.389
the jungle. How many people were being trained at 
the same time you were there? At that particular

09:46.733 --> 09:50.297
location, there was only about 18 to 20 of us. And 
out of those 18 to 20, I'd say at least a dozen of them

09:51.038 --> 09:56.543
were dog handlers. So there's very few visual 
trackers. So more or less, I was elected. or felt as

10:01.945 --> 10:06.692
an elite type thing because of my abilities. I 
guess a lot of it had to do with coloring. We were

10:08.754 --> 10:11.919
color tested as far as color blindness. And 
evidently your leaves and your trees and stuff

10:12.820 --> 10:20.190
like this, as we were taught, they turn one way or 
the other. The colors change just a little bit. And

10:22.534 --> 10:26.920
this is something that is very, very hard for an 
average person to pick up. But As we were taught, we

10:27.477 --> 10:33.624
could see where a guy had walked through and just 
brushed the leaves and they had changed and stuff

10:27.477 --> 10:33.624
like that. So this was a very unique thing to pick 
up. And of course, there's all kinds of things to

10:37.069 --> 10:44.458
look for as far as the movement of the twigs and even 
the sounds from the birds and stuff like that. If

10:44.598 --> 10:49.464
somebody had walked through the woods, a lot of 
times you can tell just by listening whether

10:44.598 --> 10:49.464
somebody's been through there or not. So there's 
lots of different things you can look for and

10:49.964 --> 10:54.610
you're taught to see and pick up. And then maybe 
that was also my experience of hunting As a kid, I

10:57.380 --> 11:11.501
grew up hunting and shooting and stuff like that, 
but that particular training, in my feeling now,

10:57.380 --> 11:11.501
kind of looking back on it, probably saved my life 
many times because of what I was taught in that

10:57.380 --> 11:11.501
particular type of training. Okay, this leads to 
the next question, and that is, please briefly

11:14.005 --> 11:21.075
describe your Vietnamese tour of beauty. Okay, 
just briefly. I went in, was assigned to an

11:24.454 --> 11:28.299
infantry unit. We were company squads, you know, 
leveled down through that. I was 101st Airborne.

11:35.089 --> 11:40.056
At that time, we worked around the military zone, 
the DMZ. Did you go through airborne school? No. I

11:43.380 --> 11:46.264
did actually go through jump school as far as I 
never... I did... Yeah, I guess I did in a way. When I

11:48.968 --> 11:50.370
was at my... Visual tracker thing, we went through 
a modified school. I did not go through a full

11:53.437 --> 11:56.580
airborne blown airborne thing. When we were at 
Fort Benning, part of the training we did there was

11:56.940 --> 12:00.984
jump. We rappelled and jumped. But it was not what 
would be considered a full airborne school. And

12:08.491 --> 12:12.815
this was part of our training because we were 
expected to possibly jump out of choppers. And so

12:13.416 --> 12:20.222
we jumped out of choppers in a modified condition 
rather than a full blown C-130 or something like

12:13.416 --> 12:20.222
that. Yes and no. I did not get qualified 100% as 
airborne, but I did jump. I got my wings or whatever

12:26.416 --> 12:32.625
you want to call it from that standpoint, but that 
was part of my visual tracker school. I could

12:32.685 --> 12:34.047
actually jump and rappel. We did a lot of 
rappelling, actually more rappelling than

12:34.248 --> 12:40.777
jumping, but we did this at Fort Benning, Georgia 
when we were at Benning. Anyway, when we were 101st

12:41.658 --> 12:44.202
or Our main mission there basically was we would go 
and work around the DMZ more or less securing areas

12:44.519 --> 12:56.452
and more or less observation type thing rather 
than assault. We would just basically go out,

12:56.472 --> 13:06.242
observe the enemy, pull back and watch them more or 
less rather than a massive takeover of any areas.

13:06.683 --> 13:14.391
We at that time were in the process of turning over 
the area to the local Arvin South Vietnamese Army

13:14.573 --> 13:16.275
So we did a lot of working with them. I spent 
approximately six months in that area working

13:16.595 --> 13:19.318
with them. They turned it over to them. Because I'd 
only been in the area for six months or in Vietnam

13:22.101 --> 13:33.414
for six months, rather than being able to go home 
with that particular unit, I was transferred to

13:22.101 --> 13:33.414
the 1st Cav. And when they sent me to the 1st Cav, I 
was fortunate enough to get my MOS changed and

13:34.555 --> 13:44.226
upgraded to 11 Foxtrot or 11F, which is 
intelligence. I went in with them and I got working

13:44.864 --> 13:59.228
basically at that time it was an Air Mac unit which 
basically was air mobile rather than the track,

13:44.864 --> 13:59.228
half tracks or tanks or anything, the cavalry type 
thing. We flew rather than rode in track. And we

14:01.812 --> 14:06.520
would fly into an area and basically do the same 
type thing. I was working through intelligence

14:06.600 --> 14:11.007
and tracking enemy movement And we'd record it 
basically that way. And I did do some

14:13.942 --> 14:26.558
individualized missions type thing where we'd go 
in with like three or four guys and be dropped into a

14:13.942 --> 14:26.558
listening post area and just sit there and listen 
and observe and see who was there and what was

14:13.942 --> 14:26.558
there. Or I'd go in after an airstrike or something 
like that and just kind of see what was there and

14:27.078 --> 14:31.304
check it out. And then they'd pull us back out. So we 
were just basically observing there again rather

14:33.006 --> 14:38.513
than any kind of an attack mode or anything. We were 
just there looking and observing more than

14:38.553 --> 14:41.196
fighting. although there was several encounters 
where we had contact and fighting and stuff like

14:41.598 --> 14:49.327
that, so I didn't totally miss what was going on. 
But our main primary mission was basically

14:49.347 --> 14:54.212
observation rather than assaulting. That was 
with the 101st and the intelligence, too? Yes,

14:55.854 --> 14:57.876
exactly, both of them. Were they both at I-Corps? 
Yes. What year did you go in, or what month did you go

15:02.081 --> 15:05.825
into Vietnam? I went into Vietnam in, let's see, It 
was 1970, and I'm going to say May. I

15:16.228 --> 15:23.095
can't remember the exact date, but it was in the 
middle of May. After your track and school. Yeah,

15:25.637 --> 15:26.418
exactly. And then I stayed there all through that 
year. No, it couldn't have been that early,

15:30.182 --> 15:36.128
because I got out February. So it had to have been 
later that December, not May. No, it was later. Let

15:45.360 --> 15:47.865
me think about that now. I stayed, yeah, it was, it 
was, it was, it was Clowry closer to September

15:48.146 --> 15:58.247
because I remember more when I got out and I got out 
around February. And I stayed there, you know, for

15:58.413 --> 16:01.777
right at 14 months. So backtrack from there, you 
can probably figure out exactly what it was. So you

16:05.161 --> 16:06.423
got out on February 72? Right, right, exactly. Did 
you receive any training, any further training,

16:08.926 --> 16:13.752
once you stepped down the shores of Vietnam? No. 
Okay. No. So all your training was in the States?

16:17.116 --> 16:18.538
Yes, definitely. Okay, this is going to switch 
over. You did mention about what your purpose was

16:21.762 --> 16:25.446
there as far as being observational. Right. And 
was there an overall strategy that you could see

16:26.425 --> 16:33.372
that you were being part of? I mean, what was the 
overall strategy as far as the U.S. forces were

16:33.472 --> 16:39.439
concerned? Right. Initially, when I was with the 
101st the first six months, our overall strategy

16:39.999 --> 16:49.209
was to basically secure that particular area. 
When you say area, is that the rural area? The rural

16:52.493 --> 16:55.656
area around the DMZ at that time. The closest city 
that we worked out of was a place called Fubai, and

16:55.822 --> 17:13.046
we worked off of all types of fire bases, which are 
basically a command post in the jungle or in the

16:55.822 --> 17:13.046
swamp lands or rice paddies, as you have it that 
way. But the artillery guys would set up these fire

17:13.066 --> 17:23.260
bases, and we would work out of a fire base, which 
would be a secure area, and then we'd run our

17:13.066 --> 17:23.260
missions out of these fire bases. We'd either walk 
out of them or be flown out. And we would just

17:25.825 --> 17:35.096
basically go out and patrol a certain area, set up a 
night ambush, and secure that area. So more or less

17:35.136 --> 17:39.882
we were in a police state where we were just holding 
the area and securing it. Then we started working

17:40.243 --> 17:46.370
with the South Vietnamese, and they would 
actually go out at the same time with us and do the

17:40.243 --> 17:46.370
same thing. So if anything, we were training the 
South Vietnamese to maintain their hold on the

17:46.430 --> 17:53.819
country that we had established. By the time I got 
there, basically the country was pretty much

17:55.829 --> 18:24.250
areas were designated that we had and there was it 
was just a I don't know sniper attacks and small you

17:55.829 --> 18:24.250
know companies would would hit us and stuff like 
that there was never a major offensives most of

17:55.829 --> 18:24.250
those that all happened in the late 60s early 60s 
late 60s by the time the 70s came along there was

17:55.829 --> 18:24.250
really no major overruns or major offensives 
there's a few in the country but it was pretty much

17:55.829 --> 18:24.250
just small contacts here and there. There was no 
major uproar anywhere, basically. Right.

18:30.471 --> 18:34.356
Describe some of the operations that you went on 
that worked rather well. Well...

18:35.618 --> 18:41.285
Or if that's even applicable. Well, basically, 
you know, just an average operation or whatever we

18:41.706 --> 18:50.397
would do, say, as a company, they'd send us out in 
squads. We had like 12-man squads. Okay. Okay. We

18:53.153 --> 19:05.810
would be given an area on the map, and we would be 
basically told that it was reported in this

18:53.153 --> 19:05.810
particular area on these particular trails there 
would be enemy movement. So we would be sent out to

19:05.830 --> 19:17.606
go out and secure that particular area, set up a 
night ambush, and more or less at that time, either

19:05.830 --> 19:17.606
if they came, go ahead and shoot them or try to take 
them captive. They wanted live captives so they

19:17.626 --> 19:21.471
could, you know, intelligence purposes. That was 
the whole thing. But we were to basically, if there

19:22.702 --> 19:29.610
was enemy movement in the area, we would try to 
eliminate that movement and re-secure that area.

19:30.191 --> 19:30.571
Okay? So we would be flown out to a certain area, be 
dropped, and we'd have to walk usually what they

19:30.612 --> 19:39.242
call clicks and kilometers. We would have to walk 
probably five or six clicks through the jungle to

19:39.342 --> 19:47.612
this particular area, and it would be done in a very 
quiet, you know, mode. Usually on a two- to

19:47.997 --> 19:59.309
three-day mission we carried what was called 
light to fight, so we had very light rucks with

19:47.997 --> 19:59.309
almost nothing in them, you know, just our water 
and a couple of days' rations and, you know, our

19:47.997 --> 19:59.309
ammo, and that was about it. So we didn't carry a lot 
of gear on a short mission like that. We'd go out in

20:03.012 --> 20:14.044
the area, we'd find where the enemy had been 
moving, and a lot of this was left up to the sergeant

20:03.012 --> 20:14.044
and lieutenant type thing, you know, basically 
through the compass headings and stuff like that.

20:14.084 --> 20:15.405
They would actually get us there. And then once we 
got there, we would set up our ambush site with our

20:15.807 --> 20:24.018
claymores, and we'd set up a perimeter getting 
ready for the people to walk through or something

20:15.807 --> 20:24.018
like that. And then we would just sit there at 
night, and we usually carried at least one

20:24.519 --> 20:32.790
starlight scope in the squad, and we'd just pass 
that around to the guys that was on watch at that

20:24.519 --> 20:32.790
time. And if anything ever came in, you'd always 
click your claymores and blow them, and then

20:33.231 --> 20:38.498
everybody would open up fire at that time. And then 
you'd call in people the next morning or whatever.

20:43.104 --> 20:44.987
If you had to have an airstrike, you'd call in 
something A lot of times we would call in the Navy up

20:45.271 --> 20:48.175
on the DMC. There was one instance where we did call 
in B-52 strike, and we pulled back and we found a

20:48.576 --> 20:55.246
bunker complex. And we pulled back. They did a B-52 
strike on the bunker complex. Then we went back in

20:58.891 --> 21:03.898
to check it out after they dropped the stuff on the 
complex that way. Did you ever bring in any

21:04.239 --> 21:06.402
artillery spotters? Yes, we did. We really, yeah, 
we used them off the fire bases every once in a

21:08.792 --> 21:13.596
while. We found that they were not as accurate as 
even, you know, the most accurate would be the

21:13.997 --> 21:19.502
Navy. Those guys was always on the money. You know, 
we'd call it and they'd hit it and we'd say, you

21:22.825 --> 21:27.949
know, add 100, they'd add 100 and be right on the 
money. The Army guys, they just didn't seem to be

21:28.350 --> 21:32.453
there all the time. You know, you never could count 
on them. And... You'd call for them and call for

21:35.592 --> 21:39.876
them, and sometimes you'd get it and sometimes you 
wouldn't. But the Navy was always there. What do

21:42.599 --> 21:44.521
you think that happened? Do you have any ideas? I 
really don't know. There was a prevalent amount of

21:47.023 --> 21:59.555
drugs in the fire bases, and you don't want to blame 
it all on drugs, but the guys in the fire bases

21:47.023 --> 21:59.555
really did a lot of drugs, so it's very possible 
they just couldn't care less. They were in there

21:59.595 --> 22:00.856
doing their thing. Or it's possible they just 
weren't properly trained to hit where you wanted

22:01.577 --> 22:04.840
them to hit. Did they ever lose some short rounds on 
y'all? Oh, yes. Were y'all ever in danger? Oh,

22:12.457 --> 22:12.978
yeah. They hit all around us. That was a common 
thing. But, I mean, we learned to expect it. We'd

22:17.685 --> 22:21.631
always dig in, and we would pull back pretty good 
ways if we could. Now, one time we had quite a bit of

22:21.711 --> 22:25.116
enemy around us. We didn't know how many because we 
were getting sniper shots from all around us. So we

22:29.443 --> 22:34.050
called in a local artillery type thing, and we 
basically gave them our position. and said, hit

22:34.368 --> 22:39.815
around us, because we want them to shoot and knock 
down the enemy around us. And they came in, and they

22:39.835 --> 22:45.662
hit within 30, 40 yards of us, just right on top of 
us, which was good. And then we said, add here, take

22:45.702 --> 22:49.726
there, to try to move it around us. And they did 
fairly good with something like that. But in a

22:52.590 --> 22:55.814
situation, you never knew where they were going to 
land. Where on the Navy, you could almost count on

22:56.214 --> 22:58.857
pinpointing. If you gave them the right 
coordinates, they hit it. It was up to the guy that

23:02.542 --> 23:04.324
was calling it. And usually in the company, there 
would be one or two, you know, trained artillery

23:04.642 --> 23:12.453
guys that would go with us on a mission. And those 
would be the guys that would actually call it. Now,

23:15.097 --> 23:21.507
if it was just a squad, usually there would be a 
lieutenant, a couple of sergeants, and then the

23:15.097 --> 23:21.507
regular PFCs, you know, normal guys. And usually 
the lieutenant would try to do it if he had enough

23:22.007 --> 23:25.793
knowledge. And if not, one of the good sergeants 
would do it. We went through lieutenants quite

23:28.739 --> 23:35.446
often, and those guys, you know, they'd come and go 
quite a bit, so it was... We'll get to those later.

23:35.466 --> 23:40.211
Yeah, it was a situation where usually the 
sergeant was most qualified to call in all

23:35.466 --> 23:40.211
terrorists. You mentioned that you were 
essentially, that essentially y'all were

23:40.231 --> 23:47.278
turning the war over to the local ARVN units. 
Right. Did you take ARVN out on any of these

23:48.299 --> 23:50.721
missions? If so, describe your interactions with 
ARVN. Well, basically what we would do... a lot of

23:56.633 --> 24:23.552
times rather than take them with us we would 
rendezvous with them at a specific point and then

23:56.633 --> 24:23.552
we would proceed at that time and set up an ambush or 
something like that or just patrol a certain area

23:56.633 --> 24:23.552
with them and this was all done during the daylight 
hours and we did not like to travel with them that

23:56.633 --> 24:23.552
much because they were not really quiet You know, 
for say, when you're walking through the woods,

24:24.173 --> 24:31.782
you know, I want your pots and pans jingling and the 
guys running their mouth all the time. You want to

24:31.802 --> 24:32.803
walk quiet. And they would always talk and they 
would smoke. And, you know, they really, like,

24:36.267 --> 24:39.291
they could care less. You know, like, they were 
drafted. They didn't want to be there either, just

24:40.833 --> 24:43.115
like we didn't want to be there. But they just 
really weren't, there wasn't a fear, I don't

24:43.696 --> 24:49.523
think, in their lives like there was in ours. And so 
a lot of times, you know, the guys, especially the

24:49.840 --> 24:55.188
colored guys, they just say, man, I ain't going 
out. Those guys are going to be there, you know. But

24:57.051 --> 25:09.449
we would go out and set up ambush with them and show 
them how to set up the claymores and show them how to

24:57.051 --> 25:09.449
secure an area and basically try to teach them and 
instruct them how to do these maneuvers we were

24:57.051 --> 25:09.449
doing. And then we would more or less just kind of 
send like a squad of guys would go with one of their

25:09.469 --> 25:16.279
companies. We might be 12. They might have 25 or 30. 
And we'd go out on the mission just as observers

25:19.068 --> 25:24.694
with them sometimes and let them do it all. And we 
would assist them if they needed assisting, you

25:24.794 --> 25:27.758
know, that sort of thing. And, you know, that 
pretty much is. Did their officers call the shots?

25:31.321 --> 25:32.242
Oh, yeah, definitely. Yes, definitely. 
Definitely. Yeah, it was a strictly chain of

25:33.584 --> 25:37.348
command type thing, you know, same type deal. But 
they just didn't have the discipline that our

25:37.789 --> 25:42.053
military had. And, you know, not that our military 
was the best in the world by any means, but the chain

25:42.534 --> 25:47.860
of command is definitely there. And you know, it 
was followed pretty closely over there. And, you

25:51.189 --> 25:54.532
know, people depended on the other guy to stay 
alive. And there was times when you, you know, you

25:55.533 --> 26:02.939
couldn't cook because of the smell from food would 
basically alert the enemy. You couldn't even

26:03.159 --> 26:04.701
hardly open a can. We used a hand can opener called a 
P-38. And if you're sitting there moving it back

26:07.603 --> 26:13.569
and forth around the can, you had the noise when 
you're opening the can. And you couldn't even open

26:13.909 --> 26:17.292
a can of food because the noise would just echo 
through the woods. You couldn't talk. And the

26:18.502 --> 26:21.486
Arvin guys, they did it all. I mean, you know, they 
do everything in the world. You know, they're pots

26:22.847 --> 26:24.830
and pans and cooking their rice. I mean, you could 
smell an Arvin camp, you know, a mile away. So, you

26:28.854 --> 26:33.320
know, it was a situation where we did not really 
like to work with them that much. And, you know, we

26:34.080 --> 26:41.870
were basically, like I said, just trying to, at 
that time with 101st, trying to get the area secure

26:34.080 --> 26:41.870
so we could turn it over to them. And we were just 
more or less in a stand-down mode for those six

26:42.350 --> 26:46.315
months. Although there was quite a bit of contact, 
we'd go out and actually come in contact with 25 or

26:46.497 --> 27:00.535
30 of the enemy and have shooting back and forth and 
basically people would be killed and stuff like

26:46.497 --> 27:00.535
that. My original squad of 12 guys there's nine of 
them that did not come back. And so there's only

27:05.448 --> 27:07.510
three of us that made it back. So, I mean, you know, 
there was a lot of guys that would get killed, and

27:07.530 --> 27:14.358
the newbies would seem to go first. You know, they 
just, a lot of guys coming out of basic training or

27:14.378 --> 27:30.595
AIT who had no knowledge of the jungle, like I 
wouldn't have had if I wouldn't have had my tracker

27:14.378 --> 27:30.595
school, would come in and, you know, they'd just be 
bopping down a trail and get blown away or step on a

27:14.378 --> 27:30.595
landmine or tripwire or something like that. And 
usually booby traps or snipers killed the

27:30.997 --> 27:43.252
majority of them rather than major offensive, you 
know, it was more or less a they'd wound one guy and

27:30.997 --> 27:43.252
take two guys to carry him out type deal, you know, 
that sort of thing. Did it seem like that, well, I

27:44.053 --> 27:50.261
don't want to get to the enemy yet. Let me finish one 
last question. Sure, no problem. And that is were

27:53.265 --> 27:57.190
there any effective Arvin units that you knew of or 
worked with? Yeah, there were some that were

27:57.592 --> 28:00.512
better, yes. We always worked with different 
units all the time, and There were some units that

28:03.329 --> 28:06.334
did seem to be better than others, yes. There's no 
doubt about it. It's just like any, I guess,

28:08.457 --> 28:09.979
anything. It's the personnel that you're working 
with. But there were some units that seemed to be a

28:12.423 --> 28:18.032
lot more trained and better at what they were 
doing, you know, that way. But overall, to pick up

28:18.292 --> 28:23.480
on what you said earlier, but overall, do you think 
most of them didn't really care? They were pretty

28:24.261 --> 28:29.269
much overall drafted just like I was drafted, and 
they didn't want to be there. And they could care

28:29.637 --> 28:34.402
less who their government was or what, you know, 
from that standpoint. So the overall feeling at

28:34.422 --> 28:38.467
that time in that area, they just could care less. 
Were they unappreciative of y'all? No, not

28:43.472 --> 28:44.293
really. I think they were appreciative because we 
fed them, we clothed them, we gave them their

28:44.353 --> 28:52.382
weapons and their ammunition. And, you know, to 
them it was great. I mean, they had food, they had

28:54.885 --> 28:58.429
clothing, they had rifles. They were 
appreciative from that point, but, you know, it

28:58.831 --> 29:16.754
was a situation, you know, even, you know, the 
Altieri and stuff like that, we'd walk up with

28:58.831 --> 29:16.754
firebases that we'd built for them and, you know, 
turn around and leave, and a month later we might

28:58.831 --> 29:16.754
have to go back in there and take it back again after 
the Arvids had done let the enemy overrun it and

28:58.831 --> 29:16.754
take everything. And we'd go back and it'd just 
totally be overrun and gone, and the Arvids would

29:17.415 --> 29:23.823
lose it all, and they'd just turn, tell, and run or 
be all killed. So they just, they weren't

29:24.584 --> 29:28.669
fighters, and they really weren't interested in 
securing anything. Although they did want what we

29:28.885 --> 29:32.468
would give them. They had their hands out all day 
long, but they really didn't care about it after

29:32.689 --> 29:39.475
they got it, or try to take care of it, basically. I 
guess they weren't too interested in the land as

29:39.495 --> 29:43.499
long as they got the food. Yeah, we fed them and 
clothed them, and they were pleased. They loved

29:45.621 --> 29:46.141
it. It has been said that the enemy controlled the 
night, and we controlled the day. Did this apply to

29:50.786 --> 29:53.088
the areas you worked in? Pretty much. How did it 
affect the way y'all operated? We very, very

29:56.797 --> 30:04.488
seldom ever moved at night because that really was 
when they moved. And they were experts at jungle

30:05.550 --> 30:10.858
warfare where we were not. Even with their 
training? Well, I probably could have felt pretty

30:13.402 --> 30:16.065
good. Now, some of the special forces and stuff 
like that were really trained to move. I know some

30:19.951 --> 30:26.601
of the Marines and stuff like that, but your, 
quote, basic Army infantry unit, was not trained

30:26.868 --> 30:28.590
like that. They had no warfare as far as guerrilla 
warfare or anything like that. Now, your special

30:33.517 --> 30:48.676
forces guys and stuff like that, they were very 
capable of going in and moving around at night and

30:33.517 --> 30:48.676
being very good with the camouflage and stuff like 
that where they could do their thing, but your

30:33.517 --> 30:48.676
special forces were the only ones that really 
could do that. The general consensus of the Army

30:49.057 --> 30:55.305
over there, your average infantry grunt, they 
called them, They could not do that safely. There

30:57.392 --> 31:03.220
was just too many numbers of them, and they were too 
clumsy and loud, and they just didn't have the

30:57.392 --> 31:03.220
training to move around at night. Where your 
enemy, which I found more of your what I would call

31:03.560 --> 31:11.091
Viet Cong rather than NVA. So you didn't come in 
that much contact? Not that many contact with the

31:13.374 --> 31:15.778
regular Army. Now, we did see some, but not in 
numbers at all, very, very limited. I guess the

31:20.545 --> 31:23.689
most numbers we ever saw were actually Viet Cong. 
And those guys were their typical pajamas, your

31:23.990 --> 31:30.477
black-type suit, you know, and their little hats. 
And they carried the AK-47s and, you know, brass

31:30.917 --> 31:39.325
and tubes on their back, you know, of the food and, 
you know, very little anything. They could move

31:39.386 --> 31:43.950
very, very quickly and quietly through the 
jungle, and you never even know they were there.

31:45.912 --> 31:49.556
But it was a situation where, yes, they definitely 
controlled the night. We would set up ambushes and

31:49.576 --> 31:51.718
wait for them. Where if we moved, we would usually 
run into a sniper or something and be shot at. They

31:58.041 --> 32:00.988
would always see us before we'd see them if we were 
moving. Whereas if we were actually sitting and

32:01.348 --> 32:11.091
waiting for them, then usually we were a lot more 
effective setting them up in ambush rather than us

32:01.348 --> 32:11.091
actually moving. Did you set up any ambushes? You 
didn't set up any ambushes when you were with the

32:13.829 --> 32:18.839
1st Cav and with the intelligence. Yes, we did set 
some up, but not near in the capacity that we did up

32:18.859 --> 32:24.150
on the DMZ. The primary purpose of the 1st Cav? 
Where I was was just observation. Okay, and

32:28.499 --> 32:29.942
intelligence. Intelligence reporting, yes, 
exactly, because when I was intelligence now,

32:33.278 --> 32:42.092
There was a couple of times we did actually go up and 
we set up a couple of ambushes because we wanted to

32:33.278 --> 32:42.092
actually see how many people there were. And 
rather than try to sit there and be quiet and let

32:42.132 --> 32:51.266
them go by, we felt it would be better to go ahead and 
ambush them and try to take some prisoners for

32:42.132 --> 32:51.266
intelligent purposes. Did you ever take 
prisoners successfully? Oh, yes. Oh, yes,

32:54.411 --> 32:55.072
definitely. Okay. That was our main purpose when 
we did do an ambush was to take them alive so we could

32:57.005 --> 33:03.433
go back and actually have them interrogated. And 
several times we would have prisoners and take

33:04.274 --> 33:08.539
them back. When we did do that, they would fly out 
and pick them up real quick. And I did several

33:14.186 --> 33:15.427
times. I would actually, if I was in the rear and 
they called in and said somebody had prisoners, I

33:15.527 --> 33:26.320
would fly out with my training and act as a guard 
basically to take the prisoners back to the bases

33:15.527 --> 33:26.320
to have them interrogated. With their training? 
Well, because of my being a, quote, infantry

33:28.651 --> 33:31.475
soldier. See, a lot of these guys in the rear area 
were only clerks and typists, and they had gone

33:31.776 --> 33:44.516
through a basic training, but they had not been 
trained in any kind of warfare whatsoever, where

33:31.776 --> 33:44.516
they didn't leave the fire bases. They stayed 
right there in the secured area of the fire base and

33:44.816 --> 33:49.483
never really went into the jungle. So there's... 
all different sides of the military that were

33:50.735 --> 33:55.421
there, you know, that they never actually got out 
and fought. You know, they might have gotten shot

33:55.441 --> 34:06.435
at or had a firebomb thrown at them in the Saigon or 
something like that, but they actually did get out

33:55.441 --> 34:06.435
in the jungle and, you know, didn't see warfare or 
anything like that. But we definitely did take

34:06.475 --> 34:11.882
prisoners when we could, and they wanted 
prisoners. Of course, they wanted headcount, and

34:11.902 --> 34:18.611
there was a couple of colonels, you know, they just 
thrived on shooting people and cutting their ears

34:11.902 --> 34:18.611
off. This was not really... These were U.S. 
colonels? Yeah, they really, you know, it wasn't

34:21.544 --> 34:23.966
adequate. They were, you know, supposedly done. 
You know, they didn't, it was hush-hush. But, you

34:27.490 --> 34:31.395
know, if you came back and you had some ears, the guy 
would give you a beer or something. You know, you

34:31.415 --> 34:37.822
got rewarded for killing somebody, in other 
words. Then I take it there was, you did hear the

34:37.882 --> 34:42.487
rule of if it's dead, it's VC. Right, right. Did you 
ever see any cases where... it was obvious that

34:47.941 --> 34:55.929
that was dead villagers, old papa-san, so to say, 
mama-san dead villagers that y'all counted?

34:56.310 --> 34:59.313
Well, we never actually did anything ourselves. 
Now, we would go into villages that had been

34:59.393 --> 35:09.203
overrun, burned, that, you know, obviously in 
the, you know, before we'd gotten there. And

35:10.064 --> 35:13.748
sometimes we would actually have to dig up grave 
sites. And we did this for a couple of reasons.

35:16.931 --> 35:17.712
Number one, because a lot of times the enemy would 
bury stuff in grave sites, and we would be looking

35:18.046 --> 35:28.939
for their caches, which was basically food and or 
weapons. And another thing, we were looking for

35:29.560 --> 35:31.723
American soldiers. And in the respect that we were 
basically on the mode, we were pulling out and

35:32.764 --> 35:40.093
leaving that particular area, we would go in. If we 
found a village in a grave site that looked like it

35:40.193 --> 35:47.142
was fresh, we would dig it up and inspect it to see 
what it was. And I personally did not ever see any

35:47.408 --> 35:56.117
women and or children shot or anything like that, 
but I heard a lot about it. And, you know, there was

35:56.217 --> 36:02.404
always the rumor that it did happen, but I never 
actually saw any of it myself directly. Did you

36:02.424 --> 36:11.653
ever see or see of any falsification of body 
counts?

36:11.773 --> 36:14.276
I'm asking mainly about Blaine. Yeah, I know what 
you're saying there. I heard about them, but I

36:16.518 --> 36:20.203
never saw anything directly. You know, some of the 
squads that come back in and they say they found a VC

36:20.684 --> 36:30.177
village and they had gone in and shot them and they 
killed 20 of them or something like that. And, you

36:30.878 --> 36:33.501
know, you say, well, you know, who were they? You 
know, and, oh, well, mom signed, papa signed,

36:33.521 --> 36:37.567
da-da-da, you know, this sort of thing. And they 
say, you know, the ones they killed were men and

36:37.607 --> 36:43.115
women, but they were all VC, you know. Yeah. you 
know, you kind of say, really, were they or weren't

36:44.632 --> 36:46.814
they? You know, you really don't know. And, of 
course, they bring back all these weapons and

36:48.356 --> 36:52.780
stuff like this that they captured that these guys 
had. Now, whether it was VC staying in the village

36:53.360 --> 37:02.349
and the villagers couldn't run them out and they 
just went in and shot them all, you know, nobody

36:53.360 --> 37:02.349
really knows, you know, that sort of thing. You 
never could really tell. But I personally, in my

37:03.510 --> 37:07.714
particular activity, never saw that or did any of 
that. The one thing that you mentioned that I want

37:08.835 --> 37:13.339
to ask about, Was it ever clear to you exactly who 
the enemy was? No, not really. Did you ever get the

37:17.811 --> 37:22.115
feeling like the enemy was every Vietnamese that 
you saw and everyone? You could never really trust

37:22.135 --> 37:26.339
anyone. They, like, sometimes I went back to the 
rear area a couple times and, you know, you would be

37:27.159 --> 37:39.029
in a secure base or camp, but their villages would 
be all around the camp, okay? And during the

37:39.750 --> 37:43.393
daytime, you could drive into the villages and 
basically shop if you want to tell me you know from

37:43.880 --> 38:11.676
that i mean we really didn't do that but i mean they 
had stuff you could go in there and like as you go to

37:43.880 --> 38:11.676
bars and drank and stuff like that and their 
prostitution was very prominent there there was a

37:43.880 --> 38:11.676
lot of girls you know you can always go get a girl get 
a you know a layer or whatever you want to call it

37:43.880 --> 38:11.676
that way they had real strict curfews at night and 
they said do not spend the night in the villages get

37:43.880 --> 38:11.676
back to the to secure camp And they said because the 
VC at night come into the villages. And if you're

38:15.723 --> 38:23.312
sitting there and sleeping in one of the hooches 
with a prostitute, the VC come in there, it could

38:15.723 --> 38:23.312
blow you away. Or that prostitute might really be a 
VC and might cut your throat in the night while

38:23.752 --> 38:29.019
you're asleep. Did you ever know of any particular 
instances? The blacks did that quite a bit. They

38:34.445 --> 38:39.992
really were into the prostitution and drugs a lot 
more, not to – say they were worse or better than

38:40.259 --> 38:46.089
anybody else or whatever, but it just seemed like 
they were more prominent into it than anybody

38:40.259 --> 38:46.089
else. That

38:47.051 --> 38:52.381
would happen often, actually. You'd hear, well, 
where's Murphy? Where'd he go? I don't know. He

38:57.470 --> 38:58.251
never came back. This sort of thing. A day or so 
later, you'd hear that you know, they found him in

39:01.893 --> 39:06.440
the village, all his throat was cut or something 
like that, you know, that sort of thing. So, you

39:06.861 --> 39:18.479
know, it was something that, it didn't happen a 
whole lot, but it was like the VC were around you

39:06.861 --> 39:18.479
continuously and you never knew who they were,

39:06.861 --> 39:18.479
ever. So, you know, from that standpoint, you 
really didn't know who the enemy were. And in the

39:23.187 --> 39:27.754
jungle, if you came across anybody in the jungle, 
you always confronted them. And, you know, if

39:28.415 --> 39:29.757
they... gave you any indication they were going to 
run or shoot or do anything. You shot first and

39:33.486 --> 39:35.889
asked questions later. I mean, you know, that was 
the way it was in the jungle. And, of course, if you

39:38.792 --> 39:42.516
came into an actual village, that was a different 
thing. But, I mean, you know, just walking through

39:42.536 --> 39:48.023
the damn woods or jungle, there was no 
restrictions at all. You know, anybody moved, you

39:48.083 --> 39:49.624
shot them. I mean, you know, it's as simple as that. 
And, you know, you couldn't take chances out there

39:52.147 --> 39:56.352
because the, you know, The villagers didn't need 
to be in the jungle. The only people in the jungle

39:58.427 --> 40:01.392
were the enemy, and they knew that. So they knew 
they were fair game if they were in the jungle. When

40:05.560 --> 40:10.750
they traveled, they traveled on the open roads or 
on the big trails and open area. So from that

40:11.231 --> 40:17.142
standpoint, anybody moving through the jungle, 
those were the enemy. With your experience with

40:17.392 --> 40:24.905
the 101st and the 1st Cav as intelligence, did the 
VC mainly move at night? Yes, definitely. They

40:27.890 --> 40:29.573
obviously knew. Yeah, they moved at night and they 
were very safe and secure. Now, there's always

40:33.059 --> 40:37.206
exceptions to the rule, but 90% of the movement was 
at night. In my intelligence, especially, we had

40:37.490 --> 40:56.759
several different listening devices and a thing 
called Red Slayer, which was a heat-sensoring

40:37.490 --> 40:56.759
device where the airplanes would actually fly 
over a certain area, and it would send up a

40:37.490 --> 40:56.759
radiation or whatever effect from the body heat of 
the humans. And they could actually more or less

40:57.440 --> 41:03.970
count how many people was down there and 
everything, so they could see them moving in

40:57.440 --> 41:03.970
particular areas. And you plot this movement over 
like three or four days, and you could actually see

41:04.321 --> 41:10.062
them moving down a trail. you know, in an area. And 
we could send in a company or a squad ahead of them

41:11.952 --> 41:20.200
knowing that was the direction they were going on 
this particular trail and set up an ambush and wait

41:11.952 --> 41:20.200
for them. Did that work well? It worked quite well. 
But it was a situation they seemed to know where the

41:21.942 --> 41:26.867
enemy were all the time. If they wanted to end the 
war, they probably could have sent massive troops

41:27.488 --> 41:32.733
in there and killed them all and got it over with. 
But they never seemed to want to do it. It was always

41:34.095 --> 41:37.078
little hit and miss ambush type stuff. So in my 
mind, after getting into intelligence, I don't

41:37.345 --> 41:42.633
know why they did what they did. You know, I just 
don't understand it because, you know, the area

41:42.653 --> 41:55.030
that I worked in, especially with the first Cav, 
with the intelligence part, we knew almost every

41:42.653 --> 41:55.030
enemy movement that happened almost on a daily 
basis. And we could have gone in there and wiped

41:55.050 --> 41:57.474
them out at any time. Now, would these have been NVA 
troop movements? No, this was all Viet Cong, yeah,

42:02.721 --> 42:05.445
V.C., yeah. This was around Cambodia area, around 
the Cambodian border type thing where we were

42:05.729 --> 42:10.995
working at that time. And they would dodge in and 
out of Vietnam and Cambodia back and forth, and

42:11.575 --> 42:18.223
there was always a gray line there where the actual 
border was.

42:21.687 --> 42:21.787
Yeah. Y'all used it as gray as possible. Yes, 
definitely, yeah. It was as gray as far as you could

42:25.631 --> 42:27.593
see. That's right. Just wherever you had to go, it 
was gray. To sum things up, and through your

42:32.341 --> 42:36.627
experience, how did you feel about the VC as a 
fighting unit? Were they an effective fighting

42:36.647 --> 42:38.409
unit? Were they well-disciplined? Or were they a 
poor fighting unit? And just a terrorist

42:43.916 --> 42:45.619
organization? I felt there was the actual Viet 
Cong, per se, were more of a very well-trained

42:45.879 --> 43:01.099
jungle warfare type hit and run type deal. They 
were not a massive discipline military

43:03.399 --> 43:09.546
organization by any means. It was a hit and miss. 
They would come out and hit you and run. Hit you and

43:14.071 --> 43:14.792
run. And all they would do would be like stick a 
thorn in your side. They just hurt you, but they

43:18.095 --> 43:21.299
wouldn't kill you. And they would more or less, 
like I said, they would shoot one guy and take two

43:21.319 --> 43:26.265
guys to carry him away type deal. And they did this 
through their booby traps, They do this through

43:29.024 --> 43:35.237
their sniper attacks, their mortar attacks in the 
villages and the fire bases and stuff like that.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.522
And it was more or less just a hit and miss. The NVA, 
well, okay, the NVA, on the other hand, they were

43:37.983 --> 43:46.881
more of a disciplined military type thing. And 
they would travel in squads and companies similar

43:47.266 --> 43:51.292
to what we did. And they would set up, and they would 
actually, like if they were to overrun a fire base

43:51.852 --> 43:59.102
or something, they would actually have it come in 
waves. I mean, just like a normal military

43:59.363 --> 44:02.247
procedure and stuff like that. So they were very, 
very disciplined military-wise, chain of

44:02.587 --> 44:07.013
command, the whole nine yards. with the uniforms 
and the weapons and, you know, the backing and

44:07.280 --> 44:11.346
stuff there, they had good training. That type of 
thing I didn't see that much of, although I did see

44:12.768 --> 44:22.964
one or two instances where they actually tried, 
attempted to overrun a fire base in some of the

44:12.768 --> 44:22.964
hours that we were on. Was this on DMZ? Up in the DMZ 
or Fire Base Gibraltar was the name of one of them

44:24.766 --> 44:28.572
that I was on. I remember that one real well. And 
they would come in, and they'd come through the

44:30.112 --> 44:42.011
Constantino wire, and they have zappers that 
would actually come through the wire with satchel

44:30.112 --> 44:42.011
charges and blow the wire up so they could run 
through the wire. And, you know, the very first

44:42.832 --> 44:50.584
indication, you'd be sitting there, you know, 
sound asleep if you're asleep or on guard or

44:42.832 --> 44:50.584
whatever. all of a sudden you hear satchel charges 
going off, bam, bam, bam, bam, and the next thing

44:50.750 --> 45:20.031
you know is here comes these guys all running 
through the wire at you, and it'd just be a wave, one

44:50.750 --> 45:20.031
wave right after another, and the guys would 
follow the wire that was still there, and other

44:50.750 --> 45:20.031
guys would jump on their back and climb over, and of 
course, you know, you're sitting there, yeah,

44:50.750 --> 45:20.031
just like a movie, you're sitting there shooting, 
and the tracers would be going out, and they'd be

44:50.750 --> 45:20.031
popping parachute flares to light up the area, and 
so it was, you know, pretty much a disciplined type

44:50.750 --> 45:20.031
deal, and You know, I never was totally overran on 
the fire base, but they did get into the fire base

45:20.348 --> 45:26.438
several times. Hand-to-hand? Hand-to-hand type 
combat. How were they hand-to-hand versus

45:29.143 --> 45:32.689
American hand-to-hand combat? Well, yeah. Was 
there really any difference? Was there enough to

45:36.576 --> 45:37.597
tell? Not really, not really. You know, it was a 
situation they'd come up and they'd have their

45:39.501 --> 45:45.090
bayonet type things and they'd try to, stick you 
with their knives or something like that, or, you

45:45.357 --> 45:49.822
know, they would actually come up and try to shoot 
you, too, you know. But it would be close contact

45:49.982 --> 45:52.745
type stuff. And, you know, they would come in. Most 
of them carried AK-47s or there was some of them had

45:54.126 --> 46:00.874
CHICOM SKSs and stuff like that, which had 
bayonets on them up there. Some of the regular NBA

46:01.354 --> 46:05.178
carried those, and they had some bayonets on them. 
But, you know, it was a situation where they were

46:05.459 --> 46:13.187
more of a military discipline rather than the 
actual, you know, B.C., Did the NVA ever, as far as

46:13.690 --> 46:22.398
you could tell, did they ever operate like a VC unit 
in which it was a guerrilla type? No, not that much,

46:22.679 --> 46:25.201
uh-uh. Okay. No. There was a clear definite. 
Definite clear. Oh, yes, yeah, definitely.

46:31.187 --> 46:40.135
Speaking of equipment, what kind of equipment did 
you carry personally, okay, for any particular

46:31.187 --> 46:40.135
mission you care to describe? Okay. And then the 
company, too, that you worked with. Okay. And the

46:43.869 --> 46:45.091
varieties? It depended on more or less how long we 
were going to be out in the field. But that was the

46:49.297 --> 46:51.661
controlling thing. If we were only out for two, 
three days, like I said earlier, we went very

46:51.701 --> 47:02.236
light, you know, just water and rations for a 
couple of days and, you know, ammo, and that was

46:51.701 --> 47:02.236
about it. We really didn't carry anything else. 
Now, if we were going out for two or three weeks at a

47:03.618 --> 47:11.710
time, which we did quite often, we would carry some 
fairly heavy packs with bedrolls and poncho

47:03.618 --> 47:11.710
liners and, you know, carry a lot of rations, a lot 
of food because we couldn't get anything. We might

47:16.045 --> 47:18.187
carry a week worth of food and water. Now, I might 
carry seven or eight canteens of water, which, you

47:18.528 --> 47:24.054
know, adds up a weight quite a bit. And then if the 
dogs went with us, the dog handlers had to carry

47:24.074 --> 47:29.621
water for their dogs. So, I mean, you know, 
depending on where we were going and what we were

47:30.241 --> 47:38.591
doing, the ruck stacks were designed basically 
like your camping rucks that you see nowadays. I

47:38.651 --> 47:39.452
think that kind of came out of the war or whatever, 
but they were fairly comfortable and you could

47:39.635 --> 47:45.716
really pack a lot of weight on them and not have to 
worry too much. What I hated more than anything...
