00:02.883 --> 00:10.896
So every year, they appointed a new committee on the same subject.

00:10.916 --> 00:12.398
And then they would table the motion.

00:14.822 --> 00:21.732
And when I heard here, the people in the committee had spent a great deal of time and effort to come to a conclusion.

00:23.375 --> 00:26.560
And in every case, it was the same conclusion, obviously.

00:27.401 --> 00:29.785
And so every year, they tabled it.

00:31.756 --> 00:38.223
And so after hearing all of this, and then somebody said, well, let's table a motion.

00:39.104 --> 00:46.852
I got up and said, if we table this one more time, this meeting is nothing but a damn farce.

00:49.175 --> 00:52.879
And that was what I was known for after that.

00:55.381 --> 01:01.628
One of my colleagues, since I came at midterm, had called me Fish Pierce.

01:02.215 --> 01:08.767
So I was Fish Pierce, and then after that meeting, I was Ferocious Fish Pierce.

01:09.989 --> 01:11.151
And that was my nickname.

01:13.035 --> 01:21.490
And people would say, it's nothing but a damn farce, and greeted Jimmy for months after that.

01:21.622 --> 01:23.004
And so I got to be well known.

01:23.104 --> 01:25.228
I never could keep my mouth shut at meetings.

01:25.328 --> 01:31.477
I always go into a meeting and say, now Frank, you don't have to say anything.

01:31.557 --> 01:38.708
And then somebody would say something stupid and I would, mouth would open, I would say something that was devastating or sarcastic.

01:39.650 --> 01:46.380
In those early years, were there annual pay increases for faculty?

01:48.554 --> 01:53.198
There were, you usually got a pay increase, but not a whole lot.

01:53.278 --> 01:56.261
How did you learn what your new salary was going to be?

01:56.281 --> 01:59.624
You got a little slip of paper saying what your rank was.

02:01.045 --> 02:08.652
It was a Xerox or meme graph blank and it had, so your salary is such and such.

02:08.873 --> 02:16.840
You're hired for nine months or 10 and a half months or 12 months and your rank is.

02:16.820 --> 02:17.982
and that's what you got.

02:18.122 --> 02:19.825
You had no written contract.

02:20.947 --> 02:28.641
And who decided in the early years what courses you would teach and what hours they would be, those courses would be?

02:28.661 --> 02:31.346
Well, usually the schedule committee.

02:32.288 --> 02:32.889
In the department?

02:32.989 --> 02:37.056
In the department, yeah, with the consent of the head.

02:38.082 --> 02:42.896
And I served many years on the Schedule Committee and was Director of Scheduling.

02:43.438 --> 02:48.212
After I got to be Director of Scheduling, nobody really told me what to do.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.665
You, certain people,

02:53.827 --> 02:54.828
owned courses.

02:55.950 --> 03:02.938
And so my favorite story about that happened just about a year ago when Stanley Archer died.

03:04.080 --> 03:13.692
Stanley, being a professor, owned a certain course, and Paul Parrish, who taught in the same field, said, you know Stanley,

03:15.376 --> 03:27.040
I figure that at the present rate it'll be 17 years before you retire before I'll get to teach one of my courses in my own field because you own all of these courses.

03:28.201 --> 03:34.715
And he said, Stanley thought for a moment and said, well, you do have a problem, don't you?

03:34.916 --> 03:42.332
And this is another story about Stanley.

03:43.815 --> 03:45.940
When he died, they had a memorial service.

03:47.050 --> 03:50.955
And that was when Paul told his story about Stanley.

03:51.776 --> 03:57.945
And I got up and gave a little memory of Stanley, whom I'd worked with on many committees and many things.

03:59.287 --> 04:04.574
And I said on several occasions, he persuaded me.

04:05.415 --> 04:09.160
But I said, I never recall ever persuading Stanley of anything.

04:10.338 --> 04:31.826
And so when Dave Stewart went up to the head of the department that wanted to be the dean of liberal arts and he went to the meeting where they interrogated him, he came back very angry at me and shook his finger at me.

04:31.846 --> 04:33.368
He says, you cost me the deanship.

04:33.408 --> 04:34.610
You cost me the deanship.

04:35.371 --> 04:36.172
And I said, why?

04:36.212 --> 04:36.672
How?

04:36.792 --> 04:40.277
I wrote a very glowing letter on your behalf.

04:41.422 --> 04:42.564
He said, they quoted you.

04:44.507 --> 04:45.809
I said, oh, what did I say?

04:46.670 --> 04:51.577
They said, Frank Pierce said that Dave Stewart is to the right of Attila the Hun.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.522
I said, that's not right, Dave.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.764
That's not what I said.

04:56.865 --> 05:05.218
I said, what I actually said was, Dave Stewart is to the right of Stanley Archer, who is to the right of Attila the Hun.

05:07.409 --> 05:09.112
So he didn't say anything more.

05:11.996 --> 05:17.285
Dr. Morgan, describe Dr. Morgan.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.649
Did he follow Mayo as department head?

05:19.669 --> 05:21.692
Yes.

05:21.712 --> 05:29.445
He was short, stocky, bull-headed, bull-faced man.

05:29.966 --> 05:33.231
He called him Bloody Morgan and rightly so.

05:33.802 --> 05:37.635
because of the red ink on term papers.

05:38.324 --> 05:40.386
I don't know how he had gotten.

05:40.426 --> 05:41.267
It might have been that.

05:42.928 --> 05:51.656
I remember being in Casey's one day, having coffee, and a student came over to me and said, would you look at this, Mr. Pearson?

05:52.978 --> 05:55.420
And it was a paper he'd gotten back from Dr. Martin.

05:56.721 --> 06:00.104
And there was a zigzag, almost like a lightning strike in the margin.

06:01.566 --> 06:03.768
And he said, can you tell me what this means?

06:04.809 --> 06:06.290
And I turned it around at every angle.

06:06.310 --> 06:07.251
I said, no, I can't.

06:08.581 --> 06:13.586
He said, well, I turned it around as you did, and finally I took it to Dr. Morgan.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.691
And I said, Dr. Morgan, what does this mark mean?

06:17.911 --> 06:20.754
And he had a habit of screwing up his face.

06:22.316 --> 06:25.699
And he said, well, let's read it and see.

06:25.739 --> 06:28.903
He said, obviously, he didn't know what it was, so he said, let's read it and see.

06:29.683 --> 06:34.048
And so he read it and he said, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:34.754 --> 06:36.499
It's just not there.

06:39.247 --> 06:47.110
He treasured any disagreements you had, and he would bring it up.

06:48.490 --> 07:03.392
For example, he was made head of the English department out at the field when they moved the freshman out to the air base, former air base, to keep them from being hazed, which didn't succeed at all.

07:04.374 --> 07:10.223
And a lot of people that I knew were friends lived out at the air base and got to know them.

07:12.506 --> 07:15.831
Dr. Morgan was head out there.

07:16.267 --> 07:20.854
John Paul Abbott was the dean out there from the English department.

07:20.874 --> 07:29.307
And so twice a week I would—Roy Keel and I would drive out there and teach courses on that campus.

07:30.348 --> 07:34.174
And then some days I would help out in the office

07:34.677 --> 07:47.020
When between the classes that I was teaching out there, I would help out in the office by answering the phone, and that way I got to use the typewriter to type stories and things of that nature.

07:48.423 --> 07:55.757
And Bloody had thought up this idea of having

07:57.222 --> 08:12.464
At examination, final exam time, you switch papers and you would take ten papers from one professor and ten papers from another professor and ten from another.

08:12.865 --> 08:19.635
And before the professor ever got to grade his own papers, they were graded by somebody else.

08:21.792 --> 08:27.659
And so you had twice as many freshman papers, final examinations to grade.

08:29.101 --> 08:33.206
And it was just tedious work when you really didn't have time to do it.

08:34.327 --> 08:41.676
And we had what an essay question was and how do you write an essay and so on.

08:42.657 --> 08:46.382
And we had three of us wrote what we thought.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.637
And we couldn't even agree on the introduction.

08:50.137 --> 08:54.661
Freddie Eckfeldt wrote, and I wrote, and Lloyd Kiel wrote.

08:54.681 --> 08:56.703
We did this sampling of the thing.

08:57.884 --> 09:03.229
And we couldn't even agree what the first sentence should be, how you introduce something.

09:03.850 --> 09:15.660
So I said, how the hell can the students do it and satisfy somebody or other teachers when they've been taught a different way?

09:16.805 --> 09:34.122
Freddie Eckfeldt said, I was embarrassed to hand the papers back to Nick Quick with 18 of his students failed until I got my paper back

09:35.452 --> 09:37.876
from Nick Quick, and he had failed all of my students.

09:38.357 --> 09:39.378
Spell Nick, which name?

09:40.239 --> 09:40.800
Q-U-I-C-K.

09:40.860 --> 09:44.206
That's what I thought.

09:44.987 --> 09:52.459
The program out at the old air base began in the fall of 47?

09:56.765 --> 10:00.211
You came, or did it begin your first fall?

10:01.112 --> 10:03.636
I remember going out there in

10:05.388 --> 10:10.917
after I got married, which was in September of 1947.

10:11.558 --> 10:26.080
I guess it started before that because we used to have a dinner, annual Christmas dinner that everybody attended.

10:27.443 --> 10:33.634
And it usually was on about the 19th, and then we'd go on Christmas vacation.

10:34.695 --> 10:51.544
And I remember being introduced to somebody at that dinner saying, this is one of your colleagues from the campus at the old air basin.

10:53.549 --> 10:55.411
The man was Mr. Childs.

10:55.471 --> 10:58.895
He was one of the many characters that came through here.

11:00.317 --> 11:04.742
And Mr. Childs asked me what I taught.

11:04.762 --> 11:11.230
And I told him, I said, well, I teach English, but I'm primarily a speech teacher.

11:12.752 --> 11:13.953
He said, oh, you teach speech?

11:15.635 --> 11:16.136
I said, yes.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.818
He said, what do you think of Robinson?

11:21.038 --> 11:27.664
I tried to think of all the Robinsons I knew, including a black family from my hometown.

11:29.326 --> 11:30.246
I said, Robinson?

11:30.307 --> 11:32.448
I don't know any of Robinson.

11:34.150 --> 11:37.873
Mr. Child said, he teaches speech and he doesn't know Robinson.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.215
He turned in another direction.

11:39.255 --> 11:41.617
He teaches speech and he doesn't know Robinson.

11:41.637 --> 11:42.638
He turned in another direction.

11:42.778 --> 11:45.360
He teaches speech and he doesn't know Robinson.

11:47.903 --> 11:49.324
All through the dinner,

11:51.346 --> 11:56.593
I couldn't think of anything but trying to think of who the hell Robinson was with Peach.

11:57.835 --> 12:05.706
So after the dinner was over, I went and sought out Mr. Childs and said, Mr. Childs, who is Robinson?

12:07.309 --> 12:07.769
Robinson?

12:08.330 --> 12:08.831
Robinson?

12:09.452 --> 12:14.399
I don't know any Robinson.

12:14.419 --> 12:20.307
But we'll get back to Bloody Morgan.

12:21.721 --> 12:29.309
got to talking about this thing about changing papers, changing exam papers.

12:30.630 --> 12:38.718
And we got to talking about it in front of about six or seven hundred students who were taking the final examination.

12:40.680 --> 12:48.268
And I told him I thought it was unfair that most of us hadn't had a chance to vote on it or have anything to say in it and just have us

12:49.683 --> 12:50.644
made to do this.

12:51.826 --> 12:59.876
And so he spit on my shirt and I spit on his bald head as we got angrier and angrier.

13:01.117 --> 13:08.947
And so the day he was made head of the English department, I met him in the rotunda.

13:08.967 --> 13:11.530
I can mark the spot and show you where it was.

13:11.811 --> 13:17.057
And he said, Mr. Pierce, and always before it was Frank, Mr. Pierce.

13:19.163 --> 13:24.248
Do you remember the disagreement we had at final examination time out at the field?"

13:25.689 --> 13:28.372
I said, yes, Dr. Morgan, I remember it vividly.

13:31.975 --> 13:34.257
He said, have you changed your opinion?

13:38.041 --> 13:43.866
And so I went home at lunch and I said to my wife, I said, I'm going to resign.

13:44.247 --> 13:45.728
I can't work under that bastard.

13:47.632 --> 13:49.213
She said, would you do me a favor?

13:49.233 --> 13:50.074
I said, of course.

13:50.114 --> 13:58.162
She said, you have a wife and a daughter to support.

13:58.182 --> 14:01.505
Would you mind getting another job before you resign?

14:01.525 --> 14:05.829
I said, well, that makes all the sense in the world.

14:05.849 --> 14:09.692
So I looked around for another job, and there just weren't any.

14:10.413 --> 14:17.419
It was one of those blank periods, and then the semester had already started, and there was no way to get another job.

14:19.390 --> 14:24.399
So I toughed it out for years under Bloody Mark until I helped give him a heart attack.

14:24.419 --> 14:29.868
But you mentioned the red ink, and that was very important.

14:30.930 --> 14:35.718
You never did anything that he didn't have to approve it.

14:37.842 --> 14:42.951
And the moment you walked in the door with your report or whatever it was that you had written,

14:44.450 --> 14:47.515
His automatic reaction was to reach for that red pen.

14:49.258 --> 14:50.660
And he had to make a correction.

14:52.483 --> 14:58.333
Now, I will admit, sometimes the correction improved, tightened up a sentence.

14:58.353 --> 15:02.239
But as often as not, it didn't.

15:04.075 --> 15:11.690
I deliberately would write something and spend hours on it just to make sure it was as well written as it could be.

15:12.251 --> 15:15.858
And then when he made the change, it always was for the worst.

15:17.702 --> 15:20.067
Now, let's say back to your own life.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.269
You came without a car.

15:21.349 --> 15:25.257
How long before you, how long were you here before you bought a car?

15:25.473 --> 15:26.795
Well, I didn't buy a car.

15:27.416 --> 15:31.041
My parents gave me their old car.

15:33.364 --> 15:36.769
How long?

15:36.829 --> 15:41.135
I had it before I married.

15:41.275 --> 15:46.502
I guess I got it sometime in

15:48.153 --> 15:51.297
In 46 or the first part of 47.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.099
And you got married in 47.

15:53.239 --> 15:53.539
Yeah.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.823
And your wife, she was from back home?

15:57.484 --> 15:59.866
No, she's native Texan.

15:59.886 --> 16:01.368
Oh.

16:01.388 --> 16:10.038
And if her father had had teaching, she would have been born, summer teaching, she would have been born at A&M.

16:10.118 --> 16:16.185
Her father was Aggie class of 1910.

16:17.262 --> 16:20.749
and she grew up here.

16:22.252 --> 16:33.313
She was born in Iowa Park, Texas, where her parents were both from, and her father had been in the

16:35.268 --> 16:40.198
Civil Engineering Department, and he taught Civil Engineering for one year.

16:40.238 --> 16:48.094
And that was at the time Billy Joe was—in 1921, and that was the time that Billy Joe was born.

16:50.239 --> 16:56.652
And so she had grown up in Dallas, largely.

16:58.066 --> 17:00.229
and where her father was an engineer.

17:02.133 --> 17:12.650
She had gone to Texas State College for Women, was a Tessie, and then she became a librarian.

17:15.053 --> 17:22.285
She had studied library science and was one of their first graduates with a master's.

17:23.497 --> 17:38.603
And she had gone to Baylor and worked and then gone into civil service and worked during the war at Naval Air Base in Karpus.

17:38.583 --> 17:44.618
And then she had gotten a job at A&M, and she was the head reference librarian at A&M.

17:44.859 --> 17:45.821
And that's how you all met?

17:45.962 --> 17:48.608
Yeah.

17:48.629 --> 17:53.942
I always said I went over to the library to check out a book and checked out the librarian.

17:54.783 --> 18:04.558
And even if you've heard about the bats in the library this last year, well, they had bats in the library back then.

18:04.859 --> 18:05.139
Really?

18:05.440 --> 18:05.760
Yeah.

18:05.780 --> 18:13.753
It was the night when she'd be working in the reference room while the bats would go flying around.

18:13.733 --> 18:19.281
Where did y'all, when you got married, where did y'all first live?

18:20.102 --> 18:34.021
Well, we lived at about the only apartment house in Colley Station at that time.

18:34.121 --> 18:41.091
It was four apartments on Foster Street.

18:41.932 --> 18:43.439
And the building's still there.

18:43.620 --> 18:48.060
Do you remember what the rent was?

18:49.103 --> 18:53.730
I wrote an article about it one time somewhere about doing it.

18:53.790 --> 18:56.074
It wasn't very expensive.

18:56.134 --> 19:01.142
Probably about $47 comes to mind.

19:01.202 --> 19:02.665
I don't know whether that was it or not.

19:02.985 --> 19:11.919
And I'm assuming that the Little College Station and Bryan were both crowded then because of the veteran enrollment.

19:11.939 --> 19:12.360
Oh, yeah.

19:12.340 --> 19:25.371
When I came here, I was number 26, 27, and 28 were yet to come, Mr. Y and Z. And then that summer,

19:27.325 --> 19:29.969
I didn't have summer teaching and went home.

19:30.650 --> 19:37.861
When I got back in the fall, the English department had gone from 28 people to 52 people.

19:39.042 --> 19:45.752
The enrollment when I was first here was about 10,000 and then it had gone up tremendously.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.738
We had almost doubled the department size.

19:50.748 --> 19:51.569
in that semester.

19:51.689 --> 19:55.594
And then a lot of those people were, I guess, out at the field.

19:56.555 --> 20:07.648
And many of them became my close friends, Sam Southwell, Nick Quick, and the Hearths, yes, and Lee Martin.

20:08.549 --> 20:14.916
Lee Martin at one time was my best friend.

20:16.263 --> 20:20.708
He got the idea of buying overhead projectors.

20:20.748 --> 20:30.059
He saw an advertisement for overhead projectors and he took it to somebody and they sent him to General Rudder.

20:32.722 --> 20:37.528
And the general was enthralled with the idea and sent him to the Staff and Command School.

20:38.707 --> 20:45.435
at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas to learn about the Army's use of overhead projectors.

20:46.176 --> 21:02.515
And then when he came back, I always said because of an overhead projector, Lee became the head of the English department, an assistant dean, and head of KAMU-TV.

21:02.815 --> 21:07.701
He was first director of KAMU-TV, all because of an overhead projector.

21:07.681 --> 21:12.647
And Lee was a dear friend, but he didn't have the temperament to be a department head.

21:13.768 --> 21:14.529
He'd explode.

21:15.210 --> 21:19.414
When he exploded, you'd hear him down at the end of the hall.

21:20.636 --> 21:24.120
Fortunately, he never exploded at me because we were too much of a mind.

21:24.160 --> 21:29.706
In general, where were the English faculty from geographically?

21:31.762 --> 21:35.207
Well, they were from all over, really.

21:35.668 --> 21:41.577
We had a number from Iowa, and I knew that because I was from there.

21:42.919 --> 21:50.811
We had people from Illinois and Texas, University of Texas.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.343
Harry Kidd came from Virginia originally.

21:59.116 --> 22:05.225
So, and then John Paul Abbott was from, I think, Tennessee.

22:05.245 --> 22:08.810
Robert Penn Warren was one of his teachers.

22:08.830 --> 22:19.485
And the student body in the late 40s and 50s, all male, basically where were they from and what were their basic attitudes?

22:21.067 --> 22:26.575
Well, this was a very conservative campus.

22:27.736 --> 22:29.560
The whole thing was reflected.

22:29.580 --> 22:33.709
It was part of the Bible Belt.

22:33.729 --> 22:34.852
I discovered that.

22:35.954 --> 22:41.286
I made a study to institute my GI Bill of Rights.

22:41.426 --> 22:45.475
I took some courses in the English department, some of which I'd taught already.

22:46.484 --> 22:52.233
and some which I was going to teach in the future, maybe.

22:52.453 --> 23:05.433
So I took one with the 210, the logic course, and I made a study for my term paper for that under one of my colleagues, Mr. Carmichael, who was one of a number.

23:06.675 --> 23:08.317
I guess I took it under Frank Powell.

23:08.357 --> 23:09.199
I was Frank Powell.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.103
Putt-putt Powell.

23:13.990 --> 23:33.822
And he gave us a technical report to write, an essay, and so I studied the Dallas Morning News, which claimed to be a democratic

23:36.856 --> 23:39.880
paper, and it was the most hidebound.

23:40.561 --> 23:57.403
It was a liberal on their master, I think, a liberal Democratic paper, and it was the most conservative, hidebound Republican paper you could find, and that was typical of much of the thinking in the state and in the thing.

23:57.423 --> 24:02.830
You never saw any story about a black man.

24:04.632 --> 24:12.372
that was good that you didn't see another story right next to it or under it about a black man that was bad.

24:13.335 --> 24:20.413
You never saw anything about labor that was good that didn't have an equally bad story about labor next to it.

24:22.283 --> 24:27.733
And so it was obviously deliberate.

24:28.614 --> 24:31.960
And so that was my introduction to that.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.286
Now the students here, were they hardworking?

24:37.430 --> 24:38.552
Some were and some weren't.

24:38.572 --> 24:39.233
They were typical.

24:39.273 --> 24:44.562
We were supposed to have an honor system.

24:45.993 --> 24:53.725
But I remember we had this meeting about cheating in the department and what we should do about it.

24:55.167 --> 25:11.292
One man had four sections of sophomore literature, and he had gotten any number of two, three, four, the same identical book reports.

25:12.942 --> 25:22.884
But his thing that really horrified him was he had 12 identical book reports among those 100 students.

25:23.024 --> 25:29.719
So the Corps had their files.

25:31.960 --> 25:37.931
And so all they had to do was get the files, but they didn't write down what professor they gave them to and all.

25:38.933 --> 25:44.122
And so they ended up with one teacher getting 12 identical reviews.

25:45.004 --> 25:55.723
And so I remember one time I got this A report from a student who had never done anything but F work for me.

25:57.374 --> 26:01.860
And so I didn't put a mark on it because it was perfect.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.684
I put an F on it and no comment.

26:06.386 --> 26:08.009
And he came in just furious.

26:08.069 --> 26:14.678
He said, how come this paper would always got an A before you give an F to?

26:15.279 --> 26:19.264
He said, my roommate.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.349
Got an A from it last week from his teacher.

26:23.910 --> 26:30.838
I said, well, if you will give me your roommate's name and the teacher's name, I'll see that your grades are equalized.

26:31.459 --> 26:32.941
How stupid do you think I am?

26:34.643 --> 26:36.164
I said, brother, you will never know.

26:37.947 --> 26:40.930
But that was typical.

26:40.950 --> 26:42.412
I mean, there was a great deal.

26:42.432 --> 26:45.876
We had a quiz A and a quiz E.

26:48.117 --> 26:52.023
And there were 100 questions that we gave a student at the beginning of the course.

26:53.726 --> 26:59.214
And then the quiz was another similar 100 questions on English at the end.

27:00.216 --> 27:10.311
And so you normally had, or at least I had, about 10 or 11 points improvement by the end of the semester.

27:12.957 --> 27:20.757
I once had a student have made 30 points improvement, but his first paper was 40, the second was 70.

27:23.082 --> 27:33.054
So I had this one summer class, and we were trying to use up some of the old quizzes.

27:33.575 --> 27:39.262
I had a lot to do that day, and so I asked my wife to grade the quizzes for me and gave her the key.

27:40.423 --> 27:43.266
She said, My, you've got a bunch of brilliant students.

27:43.867 --> 27:47.031
I thought, Boy, she's being sarcastic as hell.

27:47.011 --> 27:52.763
She said, except for this one student, they're all in the 90s.

27:53.745 --> 27:55.208
I said, let me tell you his name.

27:56.290 --> 27:57.753
I told her the student's name.

27:57.773 --> 28:01.941
I said, how did you know?

28:02.182 --> 28:05.188
I said, he's the only one who didn't cheat.

28:05.168 --> 28:10.435
I said, what did he make?

28:10.515 --> 28:12.397
She said, 75.

28:12.838 --> 28:21.729
I said, well, he made it 76 before, so it didn't hurt him too much to be in with all those.

28:21.769 --> 28:34.045
I handed the papers back the next day and I said, well, I know all but one of you cheated.

28:35.965 --> 28:41.259
I said, so here's a new exam, and we'll see how the grades are today.

28:41.280 --> 28:49.502
And so this one student who came up and said he was taking 515, 103 for the fifth time.

28:50.748 --> 28:54.212
And he said, how did you know we cheated?

28:54.632 --> 28:58.477
I said, no, I deliberately missed eight points.

28:58.557 --> 28:59.338
I could have made 100.

28:59.378 --> 29:04.624
He flipped open his tablet and he had the answers all in the back of his tablet.

29:04.644 --> 29:12.833
He said on the one that he had done so well on, but his grade fell down below 70 on this one.

29:13.594 --> 29:15.256
And I said, how did you know we cheated?

29:15.356 --> 29:17.278
I deliberately missed eight points.

29:19.064 --> 29:22.528
And I said, look, let me tell you how to cheat.

29:24.691 --> 29:30.918
I put down how long it took each person to answer the test.

29:31.879 --> 29:33.541
I said, it took you 20 minutes.

29:34.823 --> 29:40.229
When it would take me more than that probably, knowing the answers, just to go through them and write it down.

29:40.570 --> 29:45.055
I said, you should take the full 50 minutes and then beg for five minutes more.

29:46.402 --> 29:59.035
I said, instead of missing eight questions in your case, you should have missed 26, and I would have assumed you guessed lucky, got lucky on a number.

29:59.055 --> 30:05.502
But he said, well, if I fail this course again, I'll go to Korea.

30:05.582 --> 30:06.904
I said, well, send me a postcard.

30:07.004 --> 30:07.744
I collect stamps.

30:09.246 --> 30:13.050
Did you and any of your colleagues rate on the curve?

30:15.055 --> 30:19.423
Well, I think there were a few that did it.

30:20.064 --> 30:20.826
But you didn't.

30:20.846 --> 30:21.447
I didn't, no.

30:22.349 --> 30:22.970
I never did it.

30:23.090 --> 30:25.715
I tried to grade what I thought it was.

30:25.755 --> 30:35.173
Now, we had one fellow in, I think, electrical engineering called Square Root Jackson.

30:36.537 --> 30:46.823
The first day of class took his slide rule out in the days when they had slide rules into the calculators and they take the square root of the class and he said that many of you are going to fail.

30:47.906 --> 30:49.149
And that's how many failed.

30:50.873 --> 30:52.858
We had bonehead English in those days.

30:53.446 --> 30:53.947
What's that?

30:54.427 --> 30:59.034
Well, it was English 100, I think it was called.

30:59.655 --> 31:04.822
And it was for people who were from the bottom quartile of their class.

31:04.962 --> 31:05.703
A prep course.

31:06.264 --> 31:12.332
And it was really a pre-101 course.

31:12.352 --> 31:15.336
Were there any nicknames for any of the other English courses you remember?

31:16.565 --> 31:17.829
Like that was Bonehead.

31:18.231 --> 31:20.117
Not that I know of.

31:20.137 --> 31:23.328
Most of the faculty had nicknames.

31:23.469 --> 31:26.118
Bloody Morgan and Tight Fanny Mayo.

31:27.703 --> 31:28.245
And...
