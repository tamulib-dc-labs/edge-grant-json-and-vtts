00:01.347 --> 00:08.679
School education, and we're going to get to A&M 
today. Tell me about your grade school education.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.870
Well, it was all at Wheelock up through the 10th 
grade. I'm sorry, through the 9th grade. The

00:20.297 --> 00:26.747
little rural school at Wheelock was considered a 
very good rural school. And I started in the first

00:27.824 --> 00:31.371
grade and went through the ninth grade. And at the 
time I graduated from the ninth grade, the 10th and

00:31.391 --> 00:40.288
11th grade were transported to Franklin. That was 
a change in the program. Prior to that time, you

00:44.376 --> 00:47.622
could go to 10 grades at Wheelock. and then you had 
to go to Hearn or Franklin or Bryan or somewhere to

00:47.973 --> 00:52.461
get your 11th grade. It was not an accredited full 
high school. But at the time, exactly the time I

00:57.509 --> 01:07.125
graduated from the 9th grade, they started 
transporting to Franklin by bus. So I went to

01:07.666 --> 01:13.997
Franklin High School my 10th and 11th years and 
graduated. The years at Wheelock were, looking

01:15.209 --> 01:19.715
back on them now, very interesting. It was a... In 
what way? Oh, enjoyable from the standpoint of we

01:22.920 --> 01:30.551
had lots of competitive sports. We had some very, 
very fine rural teachers.

01:38.202 --> 01:45.132
I look back and wonder how in the world they ever put 
up with all that bunch of people, but Our lower

01:45.618 --> 01:54.612
grades of education were, I don't know, just 
fascinating, really. I guess kiddos at that age

01:54.792 --> 02:07.972
really don't know what to appreciate, but looking 
back on it, I think we were very fortunate in the

01:54.792 --> 02:07.972
type of school we had in the rural community. How 
large was it?

02:11.958 --> 02:14.342
I'd like to make some sort of an estimate. The 
grades, of course, as they got further up, there

02:15.183 --> 02:29.963
were less in the grades, but I would imagine there 
were some...

02:15.183 --> 02:29.963
Oh, I would suspect there were 150. 150 students in 
the entire school? That would be my guess.

02:36.793 --> 02:38.655
How large was in your graduating class?

02:42.520 --> 02:44.363
See, I graduated from Franklin. Oh yeah, which was 
how large, okay, how large was it? Franklin was a

02:48.719 --> 02:53.885
pretty big school because they had, they brought 
everybody in the whole, that part of the county. I

02:54.225 --> 03:01.133
imagine they were 60 or 70 in the graduating class 
at Franklin. Now our ninth grade class that would

03:01.153 --> 03:10.703
have graduated in Wheelock probably had like 10 or 
15, relatively small. In the elementary school,

03:11.404 --> 03:14.147
what were your favorite subjects? Well, I always 
got some fascination out of math. Math gave me no

03:20.808 --> 03:27.294
problem, really.

03:27.314 --> 03:40.168
I had less, I guess, fascination in English and the 
various

03:27.314 --> 03:40.168
grammars and this sort of thing. And we really 
didn't have much of the sciences in that little

03:40.722 --> 03:46.669
rural school. I didn't even get a chance to take 
chemistry in high school. So really ours were all

03:52.576 --> 03:58.963
just the basic courses. But I enjoyed my math 
always. And you enjoyed it when you got into high

04:02.407 --> 04:06.131
school too then? That's correct. That was your 
favorite subject? All right, I'm sure it was. I

04:11.652 --> 04:16.539
didn't, I found no difficulty in the math courses. 
In fact, it's a really interesting thing,

04:18.462 --> 04:27.435
and this goes back to a little interesting aspect, 
too. My wife and I started in the first grade

04:28.456 --> 04:31.520
together. Oh, really? She's from Poso. She's born 
in Puso. We didn't really call ourselves

04:37.220 --> 04:57.649
sweethearts until we got up in probably seventh or 
eighth grade, but after we got into high school, of

04:37.220 --> 04:57.649
course her favorite subjects were English and 
grammar and Macbeth and all those things, and

04:37.220 --> 04:57.649
she'd have difficulty with her math. I'd help her 
with her math, she'd help me with English. So,

05:01.790 --> 05:07.776
yeah, but math was no problem for me. Geometry, 
trigonometry, all those things. And you had

05:13.241 --> 05:15.824
trigonometry in high school then? No. But you had 
algebra? Did you have algebra? We had algebra,

05:19.668 --> 05:20.709
too. I guess algebra one and two, probably.

05:25.894 --> 05:28.236
I don't think we had. We had geometry in high 
school, I believe. No, you said trigonometry. No,

05:34.912 --> 05:36.474
no, no trigonometry. No trigonometry. You 
probably had geometry and algebra. I got

05:38.897 --> 05:41.561
trigonometry in college, yeah. What were the 
subjects you disliked the most? History.

05:47.929 --> 05:50.713
Studying Macbeth and all these. these things 
related to English. English literature, then.

05:55.363 --> 05:57.285
Yeah, that's right. And it shouldn't have been. I 
regret that because, you know, that's pretty

05:58.626 --> 06:03.311
basic. But I'm told that's a shortcoming of most 
engineers. Do you think that's true? A lot of them

06:12.141 --> 06:15.805
I've seen. Could you explain the shortcoming? No, 
I couldn't. Unless... unless it's difficult to

06:21.203 --> 06:28.034
have an across-the-board interest in high school 
subjects. And I guess, I don't know whether it's

06:28.975 --> 06:48.966
math-inclined people migrate toward the 
engineers or vice versa, but I just couldn't find

06:28.975 --> 06:48.966
the interest in English and literature courses 
Most of the girls did. What about when you got to A&M

06:50.954 --> 06:53.857
in college? You had them. They were tough. And I 
know it's just because I didn't apply myself to

06:56.481 --> 07:08.476
them I'm sure because you know the things you're 
interested in you work harder at. I was sure glad

07:08.496 --> 07:14.404
when I got those things behind me in college. Now 
I've heard that too and I teach a bunch of engineers

07:18.308 --> 07:46.358
so what do you think about this idea that you find 
that true well this is your interview no i don't

07:18.308 --> 07:46.358
necessarily find that true but

07:18.308 --> 07:46.358
uh do you think it really is i mean is this do you 
think that's a general theme is that one of your

07:18.308 --> 07:46.358
attitudes that you think that engineers do have 
sort of a shortcoming when it comes to the liberal

07:18.308 --> 07:46.358
arts well let me let me put it this way i have I have 
run into so many engineers

07:46.473 --> 07:58.344
who could not write a good letter and who could not 
do too well at speaking. So I have just gone back to

07:59.205 --> 08:14.640
my own dislike for the English and English 
literature and things and thought they must have

07:59.205 --> 08:14.640
really had sort of the same lack of interest that I 
had. You know, I'm just surmising that, but I do

08:14.873 --> 08:35.083
know that it's a sort of an accepted

08:14.873 --> 08:35.083
fact that engineers do not do too well in writing 
and being able to write and dictate letters and

08:14.873 --> 08:35.083
this sort of thing. What type of student do you 
think you were in high school, junior high school,

08:35.824 --> 08:43.075
that age bracket? And this is not to be bragging, 
but I was above average student I think. I can look

08:53.323 --> 09:06.565
back and relate to my classmates and I think I was, I 
probably was in the, well maybe the top 20% or

08:53.323 --> 09:06.565
something.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.044
Were you an outgoing student? Were you in a lot of 
activities or what kind of activities? Well I took

09:14.050 --> 09:26.308
part in all the sports and I declaimed several 
years in the interscholastic league meets.

09:28.110 --> 09:36.282
I had one or two extemporaneous speech courses and 
some of that type thing. I took agriculture in high

09:36.835 --> 09:45.844
school to get a little feel of the farm that I came 
off of. So I didn't just take the things that I had to

09:46.925 --> 09:50.528
take. I participated in a great many 
extracurricular activities. Would you consider

09:55.353 --> 10:02.640
yourself, looking back at high school now, would 
you consider yourself being a person who was

09:55.353 --> 10:02.640
popular in high school? Oh, yeah, I believe so. I 
was, I know I was well thought of by the teachers.

10:15.359 --> 10:15.899
Why is that? Why do you know? I mean, why did they 
think well of you? Well, I think you know when they

10:20.868 --> 10:22.771
do.

10:25.275 --> 10:29.742
I've had, you know, I've known a lot of them in 
subsequent years. Some of them came back to the

10:30.245 --> 10:35.653
area to visit. Well, why did they like you? Maybe it 
was because I was a good student. I don't know. And I

10:41.802 --> 10:45.828
tried to get along with my fellow man. I did 
participate in sports. I participated in things

10:49.153 --> 10:54.642
that made them look good and made me look good. I 
know I got along well with my... fellow students

10:59.287 --> 11:24.822
because I was oh you know you'd play baseball and 
used to choose sides you know I'd get chosen early

10:59.287 --> 11:24.822
if you were going to take part in some of the 
competitive sports so they would ask me to do

10:59.287 --> 11:24.822
various things you know it I think I think you know

11:26.658 --> 11:37.549
You know when you're an outcast, and you know also 
when you're...

11:26.658 --> 11:37.549
Later in life, of course, you became a leader. Were 
you a leader in high school? Were you the president

11:40.092 --> 11:46.999
of your student body, or anything like that, or a 
leader of any clubs? Not really.

11:53.793 --> 11:55.956
I tried to excel in what I did. I was not trying to be 
on top of everything that came along, but anything

11:55.996 --> 12:13.000
that I took part in, I tried to do a good job of

11:55.996 --> 12:13.000
it. In the first place, we didn't have a lot of the 
things that you mentioned in our school because it

12:14.077 --> 12:30.972
was a little rural school, but we did have the 
various things like the sport teams and the

12:33.247 --> 13:01.836
reading and the math quizzes and spelling bees and 
all these sort of things but not not really the

12:33.247 --> 13:01.836
student bodies and all these sort of things 
they're they're they've come along since that guy

12:33.247 --> 13:01.836
but i uh i was uh oh i guess i was a sub leader i wasn't 
one that always hung back and waited for everybody

12:33.247 --> 13:01.836
else to do something When you graduated from high 
school, it seems from what you've said that you had

13:03.959 --> 13:10.509
firm aims and firm goals.

13:15.136 --> 13:18.181
You were a graduate right in the midst of the 
Depression. Did that worry you at all? No, it

13:21.005 --> 13:24.470
really didn't because I- In other words, you were 
an optimist. You were an optimist even though we

13:24.490 --> 13:27.315
were in the middle of the Great Depression. Well, 
actually I had never up to that time I had not I was

13:31.448 --> 13:52.765
not the breadwinner I hadn't had to make my living 
okay yeah all right so even though I knew a nickel

13:31.448 --> 13:52.765
was hard to come by and I had worked some on 
Saturdays in a little store there we'd have to make

13:31.448 --> 13:52.765
a little change that I could call my own because my 
dad If I asked him for a nickel, it'd be like asking

13:53.723 --> 13:57.509
you for a thousand dollars. I remember asking him 
one time, and he said, boy, if I had a nickel, I'd buy

13:57.889 --> 14:03.217
some food with it. So he had it just that tight. 
That's what he said to me. That's right, that's

14:07.464 --> 14:10.548
what he said to me. And he made it. He would give me a 
nickel, he'd have it to spare, but boy, a nickel at

14:11.350 --> 14:17.579
that time was big money. And that seems, that's 
hard for some of the young ones to realize. But

14:23.710 --> 14:35.086
after my dad said, I'll give you a place to sleep, 
I'll feed you, my mother made me a lunch. I took a

14:35.106 --> 14:37.891
lunch every day I went to A&M. Carried it with me. He 
said he'd give me food and a place to stay, and my

14:40.274 --> 14:45.742
grandfather said, I'll let you use the car. I said, 
all right, I'm going to school. I got this little

14:50.187 --> 15:00.569
job on the campus making these $12 a month, and I 
knew right then that I was gonna make it. If,

15:00.589 --> 15:05.800
because if I hadn't showed up for that job sometime 
there was four other people They wanted it. How'd

15:07.424 --> 15:08.165
you get that job? Well, I lived poor. What was that? 
Well, there was a fellow by the name of Hensling

15:13.050 --> 15:20.157
that was head of the Landscape Art Department. 
Hensel, Fritz Hensel.

15:25.202 --> 15:26.383
H-E-N-S-E-L? That's right. Is that what the 
street is named after? That's right. That's

15:29.566 --> 15:31.167
right. He was head of the Landscape Department for 
many years and my daddy's sister was a good friend

15:35.530 --> 15:54.805
of his and worked somewhere out there at the 
university and she told him that I was out there and

15:35.530 --> 15:54.805
really needed a job and if he had anything that he 
could provide that she knew that I'd appreciate it

15:35.530 --> 15:54.805
and she would and I got a job. Of course I had applied 
and Tell them how much I did need it, but I had a

15:57.535 --> 16:02.402
little help. I didn't just walk into it because, 
I'm not kidding you, there were six people for

16:02.422 --> 16:08.410
every job.

16:11.775 --> 16:17.543
In other words, would you consider your family 
impoverished during the Depression?

16:20.407 --> 16:26.175
Probably not in the term that you're describing 
it. We never did. Poor? Oh, yes. They were poor. But

16:32.452 --> 16:49.956
people that lived on the farm were in better shape 
than people who didn't live on the farm because we

16:32.452 --> 16:49.956
killed our own beef, and that didn't really cost us 
anything because they ate the grass on the land. We

16:51.138 --> 16:52.200
had a garden. We raised our potatoes. We had to buy 
beans and flour. We ground our own corn and raised

16:58.282 --> 17:01.326
it. They bought coffee. And that's about it. So we 
were never, we were never without something to

17:06.772 --> 17:12.018
eat. But we didn't have anything to go to the 
picture show. We didn't have anything to, you

17:16.844 --> 17:20.668
know, spend foolishly at all. We had the clothes we 
needed. Sometimes they had a lot of patches on

17:23.918 --> 17:27.248
them. But we were not, even in the sense of some 
people today that are poverty-stricken, we were

17:28.130 --> 17:37.557
not, but we were poor. How did the Depression and 
any of the New Deal programs, like the CCCs or the

17:39.443 --> 17:53.706
WPA, did they, did anyone in your family apply for 
any of those? Did my immediate family? No. How

17:58.013 --> 18:02.160
about any of your relatives, were any of those 
people helped? through any of the New Deal

18:02.427 --> 18:04.910
programs? Oh, I'm sure there were. Right off, I'm 
not, you know, I couldn't pinpoint which one, but

18:07.852 --> 18:14.139
not my immediate family. Now, we were, I'm sure we 
got some of the agriculture assistance,

18:14.179 --> 18:24.169
whatever, but I don't specifically remember. We 
had a farm, and we were, even though some of it was

18:24.209 --> 18:30.455
self-reported. That's correct. but like the CCC 
and I was I was real familiar with that and I don't

18:32.347 --> 18:40.978
know of any of our people that did. Of course I was 
not a candidate because I was going to start

18:41.859 --> 18:46.085
school. Now you still had sharecroppers on the 
farm at this time. That's right. How were they

18:50.330 --> 18:51.372
getting along? Well they had it tough too and I'm 
sure there were a good many of them that my father

18:52.373 --> 18:59.923
and grandfather would provide this food for and at 
the end of the year they didn't have enough to pay

19:00.595 --> 19:20.916
for it I expect, so I'm sure they owed them money 
that they never got, but they had it of course

19:00.595 --> 19:20.916
tougher than we, but it was an experience. Did you 
ever, when you were growing up, did you ever go out

19:21.217 --> 19:27.225
to any of the sharecropper cabins and talk to any of 
them? Oh yeah, lots of times. In fact, we had a

19:30.109 --> 19:35.377
colored lady that lived in the backyard. She had a 
house that worked for my grandfather. It was as

19:39.843 --> 19:47.414
best I could relate back to his almost like slave 
times. She lived right there in that house. She

19:50.377 --> 20:06.124
worked for him and his wife was an invalid for many 
years and she cooked and cleaned up and kept the

19:50.377 --> 20:06.124
house and did whatever needed to be done and lived 
right there in the yard in a log cabin. Many, many

20:08.517 --> 20:18.270
nights we'd go out and lay on her porch and talk to 
her and let her, she'd entertain us and jack with us

20:08.517 --> 20:18.270
and run us off when she got tired of us. You know, 
this type of thing. But we, gosh, we visited those

20:20.574 --> 20:29.005
folks and built the field and worked, you know, a 
little bit with them, pick a little cotton. Didn't

20:29.265 --> 20:34.332
have to, but did and just, and we learned a great 
deal about them. We went swimming with them. I

20:36.115 --> 20:37.697
mean, we, there's, The big ol' boys would take us 
swimming and just have the creek get run through

20:38.555 --> 20:43.342
the place. So we were very close to them. You said 
you learned a great deal from them. What did you

20:49.070 --> 20:49.771
learn? Could you be a little bit more specific? 
Well, some of the basic things, lots of, I guess

20:52.275 --> 21:02.109
you'd say lots of philosophies of poor people. I 
think that's a learning process.

21:08.525 --> 21:15.254
You saw a complete different lifestyle that we 
lived. You saw a complete different philosophy of

21:15.274 --> 21:19.020
life. They, I don't think they ever expected to 
have anything much. But they had a family and they

21:26.991 --> 21:36.965
had a somewhat of closeness that was different 
than ours. So I learned a lot of I guess I'd say I

21:38.984 --> 21:41.988
learned a lot of things that I'm glad I didn't have. 
I learned a lot of things that you see people that

21:42.008 --> 22:03.277
are real close to the soil and real close to are a 
long way from being the educational levels that we

21:42.008 --> 22:03.277
had and I think it gave you more of an appreciation 
of what you had and were. So this is the kind of

22:04.659 --> 22:07.202
things I think we learned. Getting back to the 
Great Depression for a minute, for a minute, did

22:08.583 --> 22:17.014
this, did the Depression and the New Deal affect 
your thinking about politics? Did you ever

22:17.195 --> 22:18.817
discuss politics? Not really. You didn't discuss 
politics with your father or anything? What

22:23.964 --> 22:26.688
political persuasion was he? Oh, he, I guess you'd 
say, I don't guess he ever voted anything but

22:26.708 --> 22:35.940
Democratic, but I don't think he's one of these 
that said, you know, I'm a Democrat, my

22:37.591 --> 22:40.013
grandfather's a Democrat. That was just sort of 
the philosophy of the land man. But of course he

22:48.161 --> 23:01.873
died in 1952, so that wasn't long after Roosevelt 
had died, so he didn't have an opportunity to vote

22:48.161 --> 23:01.873
for others very much. But he was a Roosevelt man 
basically? Oh yeah, I'm sure he was. But I expect,

23:07.257 --> 23:22.072
and I don't know about my grandfather because I was 
not really old enough to think about politics and

23:07.257 --> 23:22.072
besides that, you know, we had very limited radio. 
We had a radio. Did you have any electricity on it

23:24.314 --> 23:27.177
back in the 30s? From 1936. You did after 36. I 
started A&M studying by kerosene lamp. And after

23:34.291 --> 23:38.617
36, the Bryan REA went through the area. But up 
until that time, we did not have electricity. But I

23:42.762 --> 23:46.206
studied my freshman year in Amherst. You can do it. 
I didn't know any better. There's a well. That's

23:55.659 --> 23:56.219
right. I had to have a life. And that was it. They had 
had some ingenious lighting adaptations.

24:05.788 --> 24:15.518
Somebody

24:05.788 --> 24:15.518
sold them over years ago on a carbide lighting 
system. They had a big pit in the ground where this

24:15.538 --> 24:22.785
carbide dripped, I mean, dropped into water. It 
was an automatic system that carbide would drop

24:26.367 --> 24:53.505
into the water and make gas just like carbide is 
made now and then it was piped into the houses in a

24:26.367 --> 24:53.505
little small pipe and it actually burned and they 
had it mounted just like a light and you'd strike a

24:26.367 --> 24:53.505
match to it and the little carbide was burned made a 
beautiful little light it was pretty expensive to

24:26.367 --> 24:53.505
operate but that was a sort of ingenious system but 
although we didn't have electricity, we had a nice

24:54.346 --> 25:09.144
refrigerator that ran off kerosene, it was 
Cervell, they were one of the early makers. So

25:09.164 --> 25:13.450
it's, I've seen lots of changes for the good. If you 
had to summarize those early years before you went

25:13.910 --> 25:21.940
off to hand out, summarize the themes of those 
years, how would you do that?

25:25.885 --> 25:35.938
Oh I'm really what uh what vein are you thinking or I 
mean what uh well what were the important things in

25:25.885 --> 25:35.938
your early years? I haven't

25:38.001 --> 25:52.500
really thought about that of course uh looking 
back on it I can think of a lot of things that are

25:38.001 --> 25:52.500
important I like the Growing up on the farm was 
important. I think it gave me a lot of basic roots

25:57.081 --> 26:00.626
that I wouldn't take far. The chores that we had to 
do. Of course my graduating, being able to

26:04.451 --> 26:17.830
graduate from high school with

26:04.451 --> 26:17.830
reasonably high honors, which gave me a lot of 
satisfaction. The fact that my father and mother

26:19.548 --> 26:34.771
were able to raise all of us and come through the 
Depression without some sort of total collapse, I

26:19.548 --> 26:34.771
think I was grateful for.

26:36.093 --> 26:45.707
The years that I look back on this experience of 
highway building that were early with me, I still

26:36.093 --> 26:45.707
have a great interest in those years those teams 
pulling those scrapers watching drive piling for

26:46.582 --> 27:10.665
bridges with a big old hammer that they'd pull up 
and turn it loose and drop it you know nowadays they

26:46.582 --> 27:10.665
got steam and electricity

26:46.582 --> 27:10.665
that type of looking back is really interesting to 
me. But probably the highlight was my being

27:12.552 --> 27:29.194
accepted to A&M as a freshman student

27:12.552 --> 27:29.194
over lots of turmoils and lots of things. I got the 
letter saying I was accepted and I was really

27:30.001 --> 27:34.747
excited. I know that you didn't have the money 
probably to go any other place, but did you ever

27:34.767 --> 27:42.797
consider any other alternatives besides A&M? No. 
It was basically then a question of this is a good

27:44.519 --> 27:49.966
engineering school and also finances. That's 
right. Those were considerations then? Well, of

27:53.210 --> 27:54.692
course.

27:56.545 --> 28:07.702
and and I never I never even thought about any other 
but looking back as of now I don't believe I would

27:56.545 --> 28:07.702
have been interested in going anywhere else 
anyhow. Why not? Well it's just my dad had had taken

28:08.443 --> 28:18.098
me many times to the campus by for livestock you 
know take him to the vet school sure there were no

28:18.280 --> 28:42.735
veterinarians he had to have anything like that 
done with the vet school I used to go to horse shows

28:18.280 --> 28:42.735
with him out there they used to have horse shows 
where they had trotters and saddle gates and all

28:18.280 --> 28:42.735
this and the school just fascinated me the 
physical layout was interesting and of course I'd

28:43.593 --> 28:58.733
never been to others I mean I had seen them but I'm 
not sure I would have been interested in going

28:43.593 --> 28:58.733
anywhere else but those two things engineering 
and of course the financial ability to go there and

28:43.593 --> 28:58.733
nowhere else. Now you're a brigadier general did 
you ever consider West Point or any service school

28:58.753 --> 29:13.313
and in other words in your decision to go to college 
there was there was no thought about the military

28:58.753 --> 29:13.313
that did not come into your Other than the fact that 
I was I was truly interested in ROTC. I got I got I had

29:19.983 --> 29:30.416
a lot of interest in ROTC and I think if it had been 
optional at the time I went I'd have taken it. It was

29:30.436 --> 29:33.780
not but I think I would have taken it. Okay let's 
talk about the Corps. Do you remember your first

29:35.882 --> 29:40.928
impressions of the Corps? Yeah uh I And I guess this 
is the first thing I thought. Of course, the people

29:46.055 --> 29:56.012
I ran into were more juniors and seniors than 
anybody else because I was a day student. And

29:56.032 --> 30:01.701
mainly my association with the Corps was on drill 
days. But I remember the first thinking was, gosh,

30:02.122 --> 30:08.072
I don't know how they learned all this stuff. And 
here I don't know anything about it. And I felt

30:11.061 --> 30:14.246
lost, you know, because I drill twice a week. And 
that was, of course, with the military with what we

30:15.227 --> 30:29.807
call the bull tags, you know, the military 
classroom work we had once a week, twice,

30:15.227 --> 30:29.807
whatever. But my first impression with it was, you 
know, maybe I did the right thing, maybe I didn't. I

30:37.502 --> 30:45.974
don't know whether I'll ever learn what all these 
juniors and seniors know about military and the

30:37.502 --> 30:45.974
like, but that kind of thing comes around pretty 
quickly. But I did, I enjoyed it. I liked to wear the

30:48.238 --> 30:50.921
uniform. That intrigued me from the very 
beginning. Why? I don't know.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.975
I like to have my uniform clean. I like for it to be 
dressy looking and there was just something about

31:03.095 --> 31:14.949
a uniform to me that made you feel like you're one of 
them. You were like a lot of other people and I have

31:15.329 --> 31:28.465
always liked

31:15.329 --> 31:28.465
group action.
