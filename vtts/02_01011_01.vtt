00:07.237 --> 00:17.071
This is an interview with George Allen Bikima by 
Stephanie Lawson on Saturday, April 28, 1991 at a

00:07.237 --> 00:17.071
friend's home concerning the counterculture of 
the 1960s. In the interest of accumulating

00:17.892 --> 00:25.583
knowledge, I am asking you to donate this tape to me 
or to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in the

00:17.892 --> 00:25.583
University Archives. Is that alright with you? 
Yes.

00:32.513 --> 00:35.016
Okay, what is the date and place of your birth? 
Dublin, Texas, 1950, October 1st. Okay. Where did

00:40.362 --> 00:43.487
you receive your high school education and your 
college education? High school education was

00:43.828 --> 00:51.339
Waltrip High School in Houston and Stephen F. 
Austin in Nacogdoches. Okay. Where are you

00:52.341 --> 00:55.466
currently living and what is your current 
occupation? I'm living in Houston and my current

00:55.746 --> 00:59.572
occupation is sales. Okay. When and where did you 
get involved in the hippie movement? Probably my

01:05.337 --> 01:08.540
senior year in high school, 69. 68, 69. Okay, and 
that was in Houston? That was in Houston. Okay. Why

01:16.067 --> 01:17.568
did you join the counterculture? Well, like 
everything else now, you had to join or be left out.

01:22.833 --> 01:27.197
You know, peer pressure, you know. Okay. Well, how 
did your lifestyle change as you became a hippie?

01:30.000 --> 01:34.804
Like, in your dress, in your music, hairstyles, 
food? Well, everybody grew long hair. Everybody

01:36.564 --> 01:40.908
changed their way of dress. The attitude was do 
your own thing in your own time, in your own space,

01:41.889 --> 01:47.135
in your own way. Did

01:47.155 --> 01:52.881
you dress any certain way? I just tried to be,

01:52.901 --> 02:04.673
I guess, look rebellious, you know, like before

02:09.175 --> 02:10.938
generation. You remember that? We've studied 
that. Did music have a big effect on you? Oh yeah.

02:18.252 --> 02:23.521
Jimi Hendrix, The Stones, Janis Joplin. A lot of 
those people are not with us today because of, I

02:23.541 --> 02:30.554
guess, drugs and all that. Is that what you listen 
to? Oh yeah.

02:35.197 --> 02:38.562
What was your overall attitude during this time? 
Did you have any slogans or sayings that were your

02:38.863 --> 02:41.667
trademark? I didn't have any slogans. Freedom and 
peace was just the cry of the youth movement at that

02:45.353 --> 02:52.243
time.

02:56.257 --> 02:57.098
Okay. Did you ever protest or march against the 
Vietnam War or anything else? Yeah, we did that in

03:01.044 --> 03:05.129
our first semester at Stephen F. Austin in 
Nacogdoches. We had a walkout planned and all the

03:05.770 --> 03:15.844
students on a certain day walked out of class and 
didn't return back to class for the full day. That

03:16.725 --> 03:18.508
blew them away. Why did you do this? Well, we felt 
that at that time Everything was so conservative

03:26.581 --> 03:54.917
and then all of a sudden our government as a whole 
went into a war that really wasn't ever declared a

03:26.581 --> 03:54.917
war and was killing people in our age group and it 
was just an overall bad move

03:26.581 --> 03:54.917
that the kids of our time just could not 
understand.

03:56.888 --> 04:04.096
How do you think that living in the South, does it be 
different from living in other places like

03:56.888 --> 04:04.096
California or up north or something like that?

04:13.167 --> 04:20.335
Living in the South, how is it different for you 
than you think like living in California, going to

04:13.167 --> 04:20.335
Berkeley, something like that? I think it was 
different in the South because I think things

04:20.355 --> 04:26.642
started

04:31.364 --> 04:43.562
eastward, and then all the affluent people up in 
the north, they got more newsprint than the people

04:31.364 --> 04:43.562
in the south.

04:47.108 --> 04:50.272
Did you ever join a commune or experience any type 
of communal living? Yes, I did. I rebelled against

04:52.956 --> 04:59.987
my parents and left and lived in Mexico for three to 
four months. and came back and then moved to New

05:00.642 --> 05:11.377
Orleans and stayed there for about three months 
and lived with several groups of people in the same

05:00.642 --> 05:11.377
dwelling. Okay. Why did you do this? Just being 
rebellious, trying to

05:16.804 --> 05:24.895
let the establishment Everybody else, school, 
government, we were going to do our own thing in our

05:26.174 --> 05:33.585
own time. To be a hippie, did you have to do drugs? 
And if you did or didn't, why? Well, I don't think

05:41.237 --> 05:44.062
you had to do drugs. I think it was pretty 
widespread back then. The most common drug back

05:49.009 --> 05:52.755
then was just marijuana.

05:54.389 --> 05:57.376
And, you know, just everybody did it. Did drugs 
have any particular impact on you? No, not really,

06:03.049 --> 06:07.138
because it was just recreational. It wasn't 
anything that the people I ran around with

06:15.584 --> 06:37.828
The group that I

06:15.584 --> 06:37.828
ran around with did not get into that, but we knew a 
lot of people that did and really got messed up,

06:15.584 --> 06:37.828
really went to the extreme.

06:38.618 --> 06:45.908
Did any of your friends ever overdose or anything 
like that that would really impact you? Yeah, I

06:45.928 --> 06:47.110
lost my best friend. He overdosed. He went out with 
a different crowd than what we ran around with and

06:49.974 --> 07:03.414
shot some heroin that we found out later, his 
parents found out later, that was almost pure. And

07:03.714 --> 07:07.900
it just killed him. Did you ever read or know of any 
underground newspapers and which ones were they?

07:15.374 --> 07:27.504
I can't remember the name of it, but there was 
always a paper circulating telling about the

07:15.374 --> 07:27.504
movement of the youth back in that time. What 
organizations

07:28.525 --> 07:38.494
or sit-outs or gatherings or things that were 
going on that people needed to attend. You know,

07:39.605 --> 07:47.372
they were trying to get everybody in numbers to 
really show the establishment back then that

07:39.605 --> 07:47.372
there was really something going on. What was the 
impact of women's liberation on you? Did you feel

07:53.397 --> 07:54.458
that at all? I never did really feel that.

08:00.423 --> 08:03.225
I guess it was, you know, we could see it coming. You 
know, more women were getting involved in the

08:03.245 --> 08:08.970
protests, especially on campus. They were making 
just as much noise as the males of that time and it

08:09.659 --> 08:35.599
was just at that particular time it wasn't 
something that was really noticed because

08:09.659 --> 08:35.599
everybody was trying to group together, 
everybody was trying to unite and it was just

08:09.659 --> 08:35.599
thought of as pulling together as one. Did you know 
any women that after the movement got started

08:36.558 --> 08:45.566
tried to go off on their own and have a women's 
movement type thing? Not really. I was never, you

08:46.387 --> 08:49.910
know, knew anybody like that. I'm sure that 
happened. You know, examples like Patty Hearst

08:53.873 --> 08:59.879
and that situation. You know, that's all I can 
really think of at this time. Okay and what

09:05.026 --> 09:12.133
impacted like sexual liberation or the sexual 
freedom that was going on have on you or did you see

09:05.026 --> 09:12.133
any of that? Oh yeah that you know that went on it was 
you know when I went to high school it was

09:12.493 --> 09:32.113
completely different than after my first year of 
college when when all this was taking place it was

09:12.493 --> 09:32.113
you know there's a lot of communal living back then 
and you know you just You know, you had sex and

09:33.157 --> 09:43.608
relationships with several different women, but 
that just didn't happen back in your high school

09:33.157 --> 09:43.608
days.

09:46.732 --> 09:48.393
Okay. What did you think about Charles Manson? Did 
that affect you in any way? Well, you know,

09:53.559 --> 09:55.061
everybody heard about it. It just seemed like one 
of those things that happened in California where

09:55.081 --> 10:02.809
somebody went to the extreme, took a situation to 
the extreme. And just, you know, it hurt. I think on

10:07.236 --> 10:27.193
the overall, it hurt the movement because this guy 
had taken, you know, and his group had taken

10:07.236 --> 10:27.193
something that we thought had some substance to it 
and then just wiped the newspapers with blood with

10:07.236 --> 10:27.193
it. So he did more harm for it than anything? Yeah, I 
think so. I don't think anybody condoned what

10:32.639 --> 10:40.030
happened, you know, with that situation. I don't 
think anybody approved of it. It was something

10:42.233 --> 10:48.422
that just happened and, you know, the hippie 
movement or the freedom movement got blamed for

10:48.942 --> 10:52.327
it, and I don't think that was really the case. I 
think something like that could happen today

10:52.367 --> 10:59.837
easily, which it probably does. It just wasn't 
blown out of proportion like it was then. I mean,

11:04.865 --> 11:17.262
not that it was any slight thing, but... Well, what 
is the craziest or most rebellious thing that you

11:04.865 --> 11:17.262
ever did that you can tell me? It was like, tell 
about your hippie days. We got into a, we blew up a

11:24.936 --> 11:29.201
telephone booth. That was pretty rebellious. For 
some reason we thought that was making an impact in

11:31.884 --> 11:44.618
our particular area for, you know, just one night 
we decided, well, we need to do something to let

11:31.884 --> 11:44.618
everybody know that there's something going on. 
And so that's what we did. Okay, what did your

11:46.958 --> 11:50.522
family think about this? It stood them on their 
heads. They couldn't figure it out because my

11:54.846 --> 12:02.774
sister was two years older than myself and they 
never experienced any of that with her. And my

12:03.775 --> 12:10.863
brother was several years younger, well five 
years younger than myself and they didn't

12:03.775 --> 12:10.863
experience anything like that with him. It was 
just that late 60s movement there that got caught

12:10.883 --> 12:15.227
up and the late 60s and early 70s with the war and all 
that and that's what happened. Well do you think

12:23.885 --> 12:32.976
that your rebellion was more toward the 
establishment or was it toward your parents or was

12:23.885 --> 12:32.976
it just a mixture of all authority? Well it was the 
establishment was everything involved. Your

12:39.193 --> 12:51.071
parents, your professors at school, anybody that 
tried to tell you what to do, how to do it, when to do

12:39.193 --> 12:51.071
it, they were the establishment. You were trying 
to prove your case to them that you weren't going to

12:51.832 --> 13:01.627
do what was expected of you at that particular time 
like everybody else before you. That times were

13:01.647 --> 13:05.633
changing.

13:09.663 --> 13:10.984
start rebelling. Okay, is there any particular 
reason that you got out of the counterculture or

13:12.706 --> 13:19.394
why it ended? Well, it just lost momentum and then 
you started figuring out that you had to do

13:21.916 --> 13:28.924
something with your life. You couldn't continue 
doing what you were doing and you had to make

13:28.964 --> 13:36.332
something out of your life. You couldn't make a 
lifelong career out of, you know, a mood at that

13:39.582 --> 13:44.108
time. And you just, everybody just went their 
separate ways and settled back down and finished

13:44.148 --> 13:58.909
school and got into different professions and 
started getting married and having families and,

13:44.148 --> 13:58.909
you know, it just slowed his pace. Okay. How did 
being a hippie in the 60s influence the rest of your

14:02.314 --> 14:06.039
life? What do you think left the biggest mark on 
you?

14:15.590 --> 14:33.012
I think the biggest mark it left on me

14:15.590 --> 14:33.012
was to be more open-minded towards people's 
opinions or feelings or expectations and don't

14:15.590 --> 14:33.012
have such a closed-door attitude. be 
open-minded, keep your opinions to yourself, let

14:33.683 --> 14:43.876
everybody else express their opinions, and try to 
reach a happy medium between the parties. See,

14:45.898 --> 14:50.564
back then it was, nobody wanted to listen to the 
movement back then. They just thought, you know,

14:51.745 --> 14:58.293
it was just something that was going to pass in a 
short period of time, which it didn't. So that's

14:59.615 --> 15:02.779
what happened, you know, with the Woodstock deal 
and I think that was August 1969 that happened, and

15:03.637 --> 15:13.506
the free love and the peace, and Richie Havens 
getting on stage, opening up with Freedom. Did you

15:14.507 --> 15:15.168
go? No, I wish I'd have gone. I had an opportunity to 
go, and we decided it would be too much of a hassle to

15:16.949 --> 15:27.059
get up there, because back then, it's not like 
today. We didn't have our own cars, and the people

15:27.079 --> 15:32.884
that had their own cars, we just couldn't swing it. 
But I'd love to have gone. All the big people back

15:36.494 --> 15:48.488
then, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Richie Havens, 
all the big movement people and entertainers were

15:36.494 --> 15:48.488
there.

15:54.695 --> 15:57.478
Do you regret being a part of the hippie movement? 
No, not at all. I think it's made the people that

15:58.399 --> 16:04.086
made it through a lot stronger.

16:07.036 --> 16:10.120
It's hard to explain. It's something that I'm glad 
that I made it through and didn't go to the extreme

16:10.180 --> 16:25.020
overdose on drugs or do crazy things, blow myself 
up or any of that stuff. I think it's just the people

16:25.040 --> 16:33.010
that are running this country right now probably 
went through the same movement. probably opened

16:33.597 --> 16:39.245
up their minds and hearts a little bit for other 
people's feelings. What impact do you think the

16:39.285 --> 16:43.931
60s made on America today?

16:46.635 --> 16:59.993
I think the impact that the 60s made, this happened 
for today, is I

16:46.635 --> 16:59.993
think back then we were trying to reach a happy 
medium. And it never did take place. And now I think

17:02.270 --> 17:06.656
it's overcorrected itself. The kids today have 
more freedom, more things to do, more money, more

17:06.756 --> 17:12.764
time to do it. Parents seem not to be so strict on 
their kids. They have more opportunities to do

17:17.089 --> 17:19.913
things. And I think that's what the 60s did for the 
kids of today. They have a better opportunity, a

17:25.140 --> 17:28.044
better chance. They live better. They have more 
money. They have more time to do it. I hope that's

17:35.164 --> 17:37.147
not off base when somebody hears this. No, that's 
good. Is there anything that you would like to add

17:40.511 --> 17:50.044
to this that would enrich other people about the 
60s that would maybe help them understand it

17:40.511 --> 17:50.044
better?

17:57.394 --> 18:00.118
I think the bottom line of the 60s was... after all 
these years after World War II and Korea and all and

18:00.638 --> 18:26.967
it was very conservative type atmosphere and then 
it came to just a boiling point that things had to

18:00.638 --> 18:26.967
change and what happened in the 60s late 60s early 
70s it went to the through the it just went 180 to the

18:00.638 --> 18:26.967
other extreme And now today I think it's somewhere 
in between. I'm not sure we're right where we need

18:30.237 --> 18:34.664
to be, but it's better. Do you think Vietnam played 
a big impact on the movement to get it going that

18:35.646 --> 18:39.732
fast? Oh sure, because all the people that I knew at 
that time and all the movements that I attended and

18:39.752 --> 18:54.355
all that, we just couldn't understand why a 
conservative type atmosphere with all the

18:39.752 --> 18:54.355
establishment and the government All of a sudden, 
they made decisions to put people in our age group

18:54.638 --> 19:04.527
on a front line in a war that they didn't really want 
to win. You know, it was costing our generation

19:06.248 --> 19:10.072
lives, not their generation. They were making the 
decisions, and it was just not a conservative type

19:10.092 --> 19:20.001
attitude by the government to go into that war. And 
I think that's why we really started rebelling.

19:24.929 --> 19:26.029
Thank you very much. Oh, you're welcome.
