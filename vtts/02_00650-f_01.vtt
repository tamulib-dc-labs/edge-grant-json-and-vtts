WEBVTT

00:04.267 --> 00:10.313
The principal job I did when I was in that position 
is all right now. You bet. This was nothing to do

00:11.995 --> 00:17.660
with the interior of the United States at all.

00:26.869 --> 00:33.936
It was the problem of waterlogging and salinity in 
the irrigated areas of West Pakistan. On

00:35.519 --> 00:55.987
the partition of India into two countries,

00:35.519 --> 00:55.987
most of the irrigated area, most of the well 
irrigated area, went to Pakistan.

00:56.007 --> 01:00.413
This was in the Punjab, the western part of the 
Punjab, the part that went to Pakistan. and in the

01:01.017 --> 01:08.528
Sindh, which is a province of Pakistan just south 
of Punjab. For 100 years, the British have been

01:08.548 --> 01:27.615
developing a vast irrigation system in this area,

01:08.548 --> 01:27.615
using the waters from the five tributaries of the 
Punjab, the Jhelum, the Chinab, the Ravi, the

01:08.548 --> 01:27.615
Sudluj, and the Beas. The word Punjab means five 
rivers, Punjab. The same word as Pentagon,

01:33.050 --> 01:38.218
Pentagon, or Pentathlon.

01:41.603 --> 01:53.822
These are all the tributaries of the Indus River, 
which is

01:41.603 --> 01:53.822
the great river that rises in the Himalayas and 
flows west and into the Arabian Sea.

01:55.777 --> 02:19.387
Geologically, it's the whole Indo-Gangetic 
plain, the plain from the Indus all the way to the

01:55.777 --> 02:19.387
Bay of Bengal is one geological phenomenon formed 
by the crushing of the Indian subcontinent as it

01:55.777 --> 02:19.387
moved north across the Indian Ocean and came up 
against the continent of Asia, pushed up the

01:55.777 --> 02:19.387
Himalayas and pushed down this huge trough. And 
during a good part of the last few million years,

02:27.383 --> 02:31.909
The waters of that, most of that plain flowed 
westward into the Arabian Sea. Now most of the

02:31.929 --> 02:34.853
water flows east into the Bengal. That's the 
Ganges River. But a very large, about a third of the

02:37.116 --> 02:52.576
water flows southwest into the Arabian Sea in the 
Indus River and its tributaries.

02:52.616 --> 02:55.500
The British have built what are called barrages 
across the the tributaries of the Indus and across

02:56.206 --> 02:58.988
the Indus itself. The biggest barrage in the 
world, the biggest single irrigation system in

02:59.869 --> 03:19.847
the world is the Great Sucker Barrage,

02:59.869 --> 03:19.847
which diverts the Indus River into four 
different, four or five different huge canals in

02:59.869 --> 03:19.847
the same.

03:20.267 --> 03:25.892
There were lots of other rivers and lots of other 
barrages.

03:27.610 --> 03:40.527
Next to each barrage were huge irrigation canals, 
which carried water over what were called doabs,

03:27.610 --> 03:40.527
that is, the areas between two of the tributaries. 
For example, the Upper Berry Doab Canal came off

03:40.547 --> 03:54.546
the

03:40.547 --> 03:54.546
Ravi River and irrigated the area between the Ravi 
and the There was

03:56.973 --> 04:06.864
a canal that did the same thing. It came off the and 
irrigated what was called between the and the and

04:06.884 --> 04:15.674
so forth. Altogether, about 25 million acres of 
irrigated land. That's more than the total of

04:19.258 --> 04:22.462
irrigated land in the United States. It's all one 
big system.

04:26.673 --> 04:40.773
And after partition, the Indians felt very much 
aggrieved because the waters of these

04:26.673 --> 04:40.773
tributaries arise in India, in Kashmir. One of the 
substantive issues in the dispute about Kashmir

04:41.855 --> 04:50.467
was the river waters. Finally, about 1960, The 
dispute was settled by something called the Indus

04:53.892 --> 05:08.477
Waters Treaty,

04:53.892 --> 05:08.477
which provided that the waters of the three 
eastern tributaries, the Bayas, the Sudluja, and

04:53.892 --> 05:08.477
the Ravi, would go to India. And the waters of the 
three western rivers, the Indus, the Jhelum, and

05:08.517 --> 05:15.589
the Chunab, would go to Pakistan. This averted a 
war between the two countries. And the price for

05:17.713 --> 05:19.596
averting that war an enormous change in the 
irrigation works so that the water from the

05:21.820 --> 05:34.638
western rivers could be diverted to irrigate the 
part of Pakistan which had previously been

05:21.820 --> 05:34.638
irrigated from the Ravi and the Sudnuj.

05:37.201 --> 05:44.051
And this consisted of the building of a great link 
canal between the rivers and siphons and dams. Two

05:44.171 --> 05:49.498
big dams were contemplated, the Mangladama Dam on 
the Jhelum Tarbella Dam on the Indus. And these are

05:54.065 --> 05:58.069
just about the largest dams in the world, although 
they don't hold very much water. They hold about 10

05:59.210 --> 06:14.224
million acre feet of water at most, whereas the 
Glen Canyon Dam holds about 100 million acre feet

05:59.210 --> 06:14.224
of water on

05:59.210 --> 06:14.224
the Colorado River. As part of this project, 
something was felt that something also had to be

06:17.491 --> 06:43.887
done to provide drainage for the irrigated system 
because something was happening which always

06:17.491 --> 06:43.887
happened in the irrigation system without 
drainage, and that is that salt was accumulating

06:17.491 --> 06:43.887
in the soil and water, the water table rose, had 
risen to the point where there were The low-lying

06:44.339 --> 06:47.202
areas were what are called waterlogged. Water was 
actually standing at the surface.

06:52.167 --> 06:57.312
By far, the most serious of these two things was the 
accumulation of salt. And the way we got involved

06:57.332 --> 07:12.287
with it was that you may remember in 1961,

06:57.332 --> 07:12.287
President Kennedy decreed that we would not 
provide any more arms to Pakistan. President

07:14.579 --> 07:18.585
Ayyub came over here and made an impassioned 
speech to Congress about this. And he was quite

07:18.605 --> 07:20.247
popular in Congress. He was a very impressive man. 
He was a big man with a baton. He looked like an

07:27.618 --> 07:37.152
English general, talked like an English general, 
and behaved like an English general. But a very

07:37.172 --> 07:41.838
intelligent general, not a stupid one by any 
means. Very appealing guy.

07:45.764 --> 07:50.029
Kennedy felt that he had to do something for 
Pakistan. And it previously had been worked out by

07:50.970 --> 08:02.662
Wiesner and by Abdus Salam, who was a science 
advisor to Ayub. He's a Pakistani physicist, a

08:02.682 --> 08:15.636
professor at the University of London, that Ayub 
would suggest that we try to work on this problem of

08:02.682 --> 08:15.636
waterlogging and salinity. a very distressing 
and well-publicized problem in Pakistan. And

08:22.761 --> 08:28.486
Kennedy said, that's just the kind of problem my 
science advises himself. Jerry knew nothing

08:28.506 --> 08:31.048
whatever about waterlogging and salinity. And so 
he called on me to get involved with it. I didn't

08:38.835 --> 08:46.382
know anything about waterlogging and salinity 
either, but I'm an oceanographer, and I'm

08:38.835 --> 08:46.382
supposed to know something about salt.

08:47.864 --> 08:53.892
So I organized a task

08:47.864 --> 08:53.892
force panel. It was called the White House 
Interior Panel on Water Logging and Salinity in

08:54.733 --> 09:02.123
West Pakistan.

09:02.323 --> 09:14.119
And this was a, I didn't know quite who to get on the 
panel, but I got a lot of help from a lot of people,

09:02.323 --> 09:14.119
including a group of guys at Harvard. Harvey 
Brooks was at that time. Weisner's deputy and the

09:17.699 --> 09:26.030
vice chairman of PSAC, Resident Science Advisory 
Committee. And he and I were old friends. And he

09:31.257 --> 09:46.356
said that there was a group at Harvard who had been 
working on problems of water resources

09:31.257 --> 09:46.356
development, particularly an economist named 
Bob Dorfman and an engineer named Harold Thomas

09:31.257 --> 09:46.356
and their students. And we put them on the panel. A 
group of us, a group of the panel members, one of the

09:52.681 --> 10:06.937
other panel members was Rollin Eckes, who was that 
time president of Richfield Oil Company, an old

09:52.681 --> 10:06.937
friend of mine. Another was Wadley, who was 
agronomist, senior agronomist at the USDA.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.710
Another was a man from the from the AID. He was a 
specialist in administration. His name was

10:24.701 --> 10:28.686
Blanford, John Blanford. And we had the head of the 
salinity laboratory at Riverside, Charlie

10:28.706 --> 10:35.255
Bower, and one of his good men. We got a bunch of idea 
men, goody men named Leonard Katz, who was an

10:36.357 --> 10:44.408
entrepreneur and inventor in Cambridge. John 
Isaacs, who was an idea man here at Scripps. And

10:50.326 --> 11:03.702
this group went out to Pakistan and looked at the 
Punjab and at the Sindh, made a trip across

10:50.326 --> 11:03.702
country, driving across country. And I never will 
forget the day that Charlie Bower looked at a corn

11:03.842 --> 11:14.494
plant. looked at the leaves of the corn plant and 
said, the problem with this corn is not that it's

11:14.828 --> 11:23.596
got too much salt in the soil, but there isn't any 
nitrogen in the soil. This plant is lacking in

11:23.616 --> 11:30.964
chlorophyll because it has insufficient 
nitrogen. And that was the payoff to the whole

11:30.984 --> 11:34.767
problem. Water logging and salinity was, in a 
sense, a non-problem. The real problem was poor

11:38.731 --> 11:42.895
agricultural practice. The irrigation system 
had

11:44.630 --> 11:59.848
been started in the middle of the 19th century and 
long before irrigation or agriculture or

11:44.630 --> 11:59.848
high-yielding agriculture was well understood. 
And they were spreading water too thin on too much

11:59.868 --> 12:05.094
land. So the plants were starved with water as well 
as being starved with nutrients.

12:13.435 --> 12:18.841
And the reason that they've done that was that they 
were trying to develop subsistence agriculture.

12:18.861 --> 12:24.768
And subsistence agriculture depends on every 
farmer having as much land as he can cultivate.

12:25.689 --> 12:33.658
Well, they spread out over a lot of land and didn't 
give enough water to any of it. But at the same time,

12:33.678 --> 12:38.744
the canals leaked, and the whole canal system 
leaked. About 40% of the water went down to the

12:38.764 --> 12:42.548
underground. So this represented an enormous 
additional water supply, which could be pumped

12:44.367 --> 12:52.495
out and used for irrigation. And it was by far the 
best way to store the water. Storing it

12:56.338 --> 12:59.802
underground doesn't evaporate very much. It 
evaporated some when you got the water table close

12:59.822 --> 13:03.445
to the surface. And that evaporation was what 
caused the salt to accumulate at the surface. And

13:08.710 --> 13:12.754
the salt problem didn't certainly look bad. The 
English, in their systematic way, had

13:12.970 --> 13:25.448
established villages in all these dohabs on a 
two-mile grid, two-mile squares, village every

13:12.970 --> 13:25.448
two miles. And there were large areas where these 
villages had disappeared or half disappeared,

13:26.911 --> 13:38.708
where the ground had become covered with salt, and 
the farmers had to abandon agriculture.

13:40.105 --> 13:46.092
Pakistanis thought they were losing about 50,000 
acres a year to salt accumulation. And maybe they

13:46.412 --> 13:47.173
were.

13:50.817 --> 14:04.012
The solution, the technical solution, was to 
drill what are called tube wells, which are big

13:50.817 --> 14:04.012
wells that are powered by machinery, by motors, 
either electric or diesel. Either electric

14:05.033 --> 14:07.075
motors or diesel engines.

14:10.548 --> 14:23.367
and to pump out the water, and thereby to lower the 
water table, and then use the water that you pumped

14:10.548 --> 14:23.367
out for irrigation and use enough water so some of 
it ran back down into the ground. And in the process

14:24.729 --> 14:32.861
of doing that, you could wash the salt out of the 
salt back into the underground.

14:32.961 --> 14:39.390
And this is not a permanent solution, but it's a 
solution that will do very well for 20 to 30 years.

14:40.518 --> 14:49.289
On a permanent basis, you have to build horizontal 
drains, that is, drains that will actually carry

14:40.518 --> 14:49.289
as much salt out of the region as is coming into the 
region from the rivers. That's not very much,

14:49.909 --> 14:51.451
actually. Only rivers are remarkably fresh. But 
they do have about 200 parts per million of salt.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.402
That's quite a bit of salt year after year. And 
you've just got to get rid of that salt by carrying

15:00.482 --> 15:07.150
it away, even to the Arabian Sea or to the Rajasthan 
desert. That's not been done yet. But this

15:10.928 --> 15:14.493
vertical drainage that we recommended was well 
known. And if you do it in the way that we

15:16.095 --> 15:26.330
recommended, you can actually lower the water 
table, eliminate water logging, wash the salt

15:16.095 --> 15:26.330
down, and reclaim the land. But more importantly, 
you've got a lot more water. About 35% or 40% more

15:30.096 --> 15:32.479
water.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.603
And this was on a very big scale. The total water 
supply, including the underground water, about

15:37.643 --> 15:43.070
100 million acre feet. That's enough to irrigate 
25 million acres to a depth of four feet. If it all

15:49.438 --> 15:55.947
gets on the irrigated fields, it doesn't either 
evaporate or sink into the ground. If it sinks into

15:55.987 --> 15:57.669
the ground, you can reclaim it. Pump it up and use 
it. And that's where this 100 million acre feet

16:00.833 --> 16:03.917
thing comes from. But the problem was that this 
vertical drainage had been tried on too small a

16:06.715 --> 16:15.448
scale. They put in a few wells, and underground 
water would flow in from the side as fast as you

16:15.468 --> 16:22.219
pumped it out. As a result, they were not able to 
lower the water table. And we did a lot of the,

16:25.924 --> 16:35.659
Harold Thomas and also a guy named Herb Skibitsky 
of the Geological Survey made models of the

16:25.924 --> 16:35.659
underground flow. both digital, computer, and 
analog models. And we showed that you had to put

16:40.075 --> 16:51.370
wells in an area as big as somewhere between 
100,000 and a million acres, or it wouldn't work.

16:51.390 --> 16:53.352
You had to drain a large area. So you could drain it, 
pump it out faster than the water was flowing from

16:53.372 --> 16:57.037
the side. And that depends on the ratio between 
area and perimeter. You can see if you have . well

17:04.647 --> 17:10.933
field in an area of one square mile, you've got four 
miles of perimeter in one mile of area. In that

17:11.614 --> 17:15.538
case, the water flows in from the side as fast as you 
pump it out. Let's say you have instead of one

17:16.459 --> 17:24.667
square mile, you have 1,600 square miles. Then you 
have an area of 40 miles on the side, or 160 miles.

17:30.398 --> 17:42.256
perimeter for 1,600 square miles of area, in 
contrast to the other extreme where I said there

17:30.398 --> 17:42.256
were four miles of perimeter for one square mile of 
area. And if you use a scale like that, then there's

17:42.276 --> 17:46.363
no problem about pumping it out. And that's what we 
were able to show with our models. But far more

17:50.008 --> 17:56.338
important than that was that this was really not a 
problem. of water logging and salinity, but a

17:57.027 --> 18:07.182
problem of improving agricultural technology,

17:57.027 --> 18:07.182
modernizing the agriculture. And that's meant 
using fertilizer. It meant using high-yielding

18:09.726 --> 18:15.274
varieties, which were just appearing in Mexico at 
that time. It meant using pesticides. It meant

18:18.960 --> 18:25.009
giving instruction and extension services to the 
farmers. making it worthwhile for the farmers to

18:25.782 --> 18:33.891
increase their yields by stabilizing prices and 
things like that. And we said, and this is the most

18:35.794 --> 18:40.980
important thing we said, was that this was one of 
the great natural resources of the Earth. And it

18:42.541 --> 18:43.563
could be a garden. It could be like the Imperial 
Valley. But instead of 500,000 acres like the

18:45.164 --> 18:52.633
Imperial Valley, it had 25 million acres, 50 times 
the size of the Imperial Valley. This was really a

18:54.115 --> 19:03.266
revolutionary idea to the bureaucrats who were 
running Pakistan.

19:03.306 --> 19:15.340
One of my best friends became a man named Gul 
Amishat Khan, who was chairman of the Water and

19:03.306 --> 19:15.340
Power Development Authority of West Pakistan. He 
was a member of the elite civil service of

19:15.360 --> 19:21.827
Pakistan. and CSP, a remarkably able man. He had 
about as high an IQ as I'd ever seen on anybody. He

19:34.275 --> 19:37.760
could handle about a dozen of us who were on one side 
of the table. He was on the other all by himself with

19:37.780 --> 19:41.565
no problem. He was just so darned competent and so 
knowledgeable and so intelligently able to grasp

19:41.585 --> 19:52.320
new ideas.

19:54.798 --> 20:10.374
And what we proposed was, and this was a mistake, 
but it was a mistake that everybody had made, who we

19:54.798 --> 20:10.374
went along with, that the government should do 
this job in million-acre tracks. That means a

20:11.195 --> 20:15.320
track 1,600 miles an area. And there would be 25 of 
these tracks, and they should go after one after

20:15.660 --> 20:20.245
the other in succession. On the theory that that 
was about all we could do to really introduce

20:25.797 --> 20:28.220
modernized agriculture. Maybe they could do one a 
year or something like that on a 25-year program.

20:33.947 --> 20:38.973
Wilhelmi Schock objected to this, and rightly so, 
on the basis that politically this was

20:33.947 --> 20:38.973
impossible. You had to give some benefit to 
everybody. But the solution, the problem was

20:43.218 --> 20:51.509
really solved in spite of both of us by the farmers 
of Papastop. When they found out about these two

20:51.529 --> 20:53.391
wells, to drill them all by themselves. And they 
drilled something like 70,000 tube wells in three

20:57.367 --> 21:03.378
years, while the government was drilling about 
2,000. And what none of us had realized was that

21:03.559 --> 21:15.560
these farmers were very responsive to change if 
they could really see the benefits of the change.

21:15.580 --> 21:18.265
And I have a saying, which I often use, There's no 
change agent quite as effective as an Indian or a

21:18.802 --> 21:25.212
Pakistani farmer in hot pursuit of a rupee. It was 
just fantastic what these people did. And within a

21:29.599 --> 21:40.256
few years, agricultural production in Pakistan 
was increasing by about 6% a year, about twice as

21:29.599 --> 21:40.256
fast as the population. And the new seeds came in, 
and the fertilizer came in, and the water. and they

21:47.118 --> 21:53.664
developed the water, and all of this was really 
quite a spectacular change.

21:56.346 --> 22:01.611
I was back in Pakistan last summer, and 
agriculture is stagnant in Pakistan at the

21:56.346 --> 22:01.611
moment. It's not growing. And one of the things I'm 
very puzzled about is, why is this so? Pakistanis

22:11.820 --> 22:16.264
have their old complaint that we need more water 
and we need more drainage. I don't really think

22:17.088 --> 22:18.731
that's the problem. I think the problem is the 
economic and social structure of the country,

22:18.751 --> 22:29.148
which essentially puts agriculture at the lowest 
possible priority. And the second problem is that

22:29.168 --> 22:43.332
most of the land that could now be increasing its 
production is in quite small farms, farms that are

22:29.168 --> 22:43.332
about five acres or less. And if you look at the 
economics of it, small farmers like that don't

22:44.307 --> 22:50.735
really have much incentive to increase their 
production. They just can't make enough profit.

22:53.399 --> 22:57.865
You need to find ways in which you develop a farming 
system for small farmers. This is a social,

22:58.646 --> 23:08.919
economic, political, technical complex of 
problems, which is not very well understood by

22:58.646 --> 23:08.919
anybody. And that's the next big step that needs to 
be undertaken. I'm going to try to go back to

23:14.800 --> 23:22.729
Pakistan this summer and look into this much more 
thoroughly than I have been able to up until now.

23:24.511 --> 23:33.181
But at least for up until about 1968 or 69, 
agriculture looked like a great success story in

23:24.511 --> 23:33.181
Pakistan. It was being modernized. And the report 
that we wrote, we called it Land and Water

23:35.103 --> 23:41.010
Development in this Plain. became a kind of a bible 
called the Revelle Report. It was superseded by a

23:46.902 --> 24:11.284
very much more elaborate World Bank study, which 
was published about 1969 or 70, but which

23:46.902 --> 24:11.284
essentially came to exactly the same conclusions 
that we do in terms of the possibilities for

23:46.902 --> 24:11.284
development, but laying much more stress, as they 
should, on the farmers themselves and helping the

23:46.902 --> 24:11.284
farmers help themselves.

24:14.268 --> 24:30.528
And of course, in the process of writing this 
report, I didn't get it done until 1963, long after

24:14.268 --> 24:30.528
I'd left the Department of the Interior and gone 
back to University of California.

24:31.409 --> 24:41.001
I got to be very good friends with people at 
Harvard, particularly Dorfman and Thomas and Bob

24:31.409 --> 24:41.001
Burden.

24:43.715 --> 24:45.117
One or two other people there. And they were about, 
at that time, they were about to,

24:46.739 --> 25:03.059
they'd been planning to organize a center for 
population studies at Harvard.

25:03.079 --> 25:08.305
And Harold Thomas suggested my name for the 
directorship of it. I was really quite unhappy out

25:09.196 --> 25:11.460
here. I had two jobs here, and this was impossible. 
I was director of the Scripps Institution and also

25:14.405 --> 25:19.353
university dean of research at the same time. 
University dean of research turned out to be a

25:20.935 --> 25:24.922
non-job. Nobody with nobody needed a university 
dean of research.

25:30.912 --> 25:35.760
Professors just don't like to have anybody tell 
them about what they should do in the research

25:30.912 --> 25:35.760
business. At the same time, I was really 
neglecting the Scripps Institution. And Herb

25:41.393 --> 25:44.437
York had resigned as chancellor. And

25:44.457 --> 25:53.330
it turned out that they didn't want me to be 
chancellor. So I decided I'd go back to Harvard and

25:53.350 --> 26:03.165
become head of the Center for Population Studies, 
which I started, actually, in 1964. which I've

26:04.411 --> 26:07.394
just this past summer retired from. But basically 
because of my interest in resources,

26:09.817 --> 26:26.215
the center has always concentrated more on 
matching resources to population rather than

26:09.817 --> 26:26.215
thinking about how you reduce population. In 
other words, we've thought about that too a lot,

26:27.617 --> 26:32.983
but we've thought in terms of economic and social 
development rather than in terms of family

26:33.335 --> 26:39.965
planning programs. This was not really a way to win 
friends and influence people among the

26:39.985 --> 26:47.436
population establishment. They were all hooked 
on family planning. And moreover, they're not

26:51.483 --> 26:59.595
really much interested in development, but the 
kind of people who support population center to

27:00.217 --> 27:15.536
people like Cordelia Scaife May of the Mellon

27:00.217 --> 27:15.536
family in Pittsburgh, who basically believes 
there are too many niggers in the world. And is much

27:15.556 --> 27:21.723
more concerned about the damage to the 
environment than she is about people. And these

27:21.743 --> 27:25.768
are these fanatics on the right wing of the 
population. say that the world is going to hell

27:26.322 --> 27:29.526
because of overpopulation. It isn't going to hell 
because of overpopulation. It may be going to

27:32.170 --> 27:35.355
hell, but for other reasons. But our feeling was 
and is that rapid population growth, which is the

27:36.236 --> 27:55.603
real problem more than overpopulation, rapid 
population growth is as much a symptom of poverty

27:36.236 --> 27:55.603
as it is a cause of poverty. And what really needs to 
be done is to do something about poverty. So one of

28:01.383 --> 28:18.728
our big projects at the center is a Ford 
Foundation-supported project for systematic

28:01.383 --> 28:18.728
analysis and modeling of resources development 
in the Indian subcontinent, particularly

28:01.383 --> 28:18.728
agricultural, water, and land development. And 
we've been working particularly on the Ganges

28:18.748 --> 28:21.893
plain the last few years. Before that, we worked on 
Bangladesh, where we're going to expand it to

28:26.178 --> 28:33.727
include Sri Lanka and Nepal and Pakistan. That's 
under the direction of one of Harold Thomas's

28:33.747 --> 28:52.450
students, who's now become a professor named 
Peter Rogers, who is one of the young men that

28:33.747 --> 28:52.450
worked on our, at that time, graduate students 
that worked on our Indus Basin program with

28:33.747 --> 28:52.450
Harold.

28:52.470 --> 28:54.953
And I'm going back this fall. primarily to work 
with Peter and help out with this board foundation

28:56.114 --> 29:01.864
project. What it consists of is that we bring 
Indian engineers and economists and government

29:01.884 --> 29:21.497
officials to Cambridge in a period of six months to 
a year and have them do research on problems of

29:01.884 --> 29:21.497
agricultural land and water development.
