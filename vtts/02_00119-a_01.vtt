WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:07.080
We're out on April 3rd. We're out on Chick Lane. And 
the sky is overcast. Looks like it might be rainy.

00:14.971 --> 00:29.329
And I'm about to have the great joy and honor of 
interviewing Dr. Frank Hubert, former dean and

00:14.971 --> 00:29.329
chancellor, and for me, seventh grade band 
director and twelfth grade principal. Dr.

00:29.950 --> 00:34.657
Hubert, now check your, say a sentence or so and 
let's see if yours are working. I'll take this

00:35.398 --> 00:41.568
moment to tell you that you need to go out to your van 
and turn your lights off.

00:44.753 --> 00:56.110
Let's begin by your giving a biographical summary 
of your growing up and experience before coming to

00:56.933 --> 00:59.016
A&M in 1959. This would introduce any reader of 
this material later to your background. All

01:07.929 --> 01:08.509
right.

01:15.079 --> 01:19.745
Public education in Cameron and in Austin. 
Graduated from Austin High School in 1932.

01:25.638 --> 01:48.460
I entered the University of Texas,

01:25.638 --> 01:48.460
had a checkerboard career there, two years of 
pre-medicine, and then after spending a summer in

01:25.638 --> 01:48.460
Galveston living in a med fraternity house, I 
learned that medicine was not my cup of tea. So back

01:49.561 --> 01:53.805
to the university, changed curricula, graduated 
in 38 with a degree in government at

01:54.275 --> 02:20.704
the close of that period my undergraduate period i 
was in the longhorn band and when george hurt

01:54.275 --> 02:20.704
colonel george hurt came to the university to 
direct the band I think in 1936. He

02:23.370 --> 02:30.219
asked me to be the student assistant director and I 
was that. And. I had honked my way through the

02:34.545 --> 02:38.290
University on a tenor saxophone.

02:41.334 --> 02:43.537
For that six year period. And that was my musical 
background, essentially.

02:50.165 --> 02:56.451
Hurt made me the student assistant, and I enjoyed 
that role very much.

02:59.334 --> 03:17.691
Letcher Stark, a philanthropist from Orange, 
Texas,

02:59.334 --> 03:17.691
and at that time chairman of the Board of Regents of 
the University of Texas,

02:59.334 --> 03:17.691
asked Hurt to come down to Orange one summer and

03:20.489 --> 03:32.608
to provide a summer training program for his two 
musical organizations, a girls drum and bugle

03:20.489 --> 03:32.608
corps, the Bengal Guards, and a boys band.

03:40.540 --> 03:45.308
The band was in a transition period and searching 
for a new director. Hurt recommended me. I went

03:48.434 --> 03:57.652
down for an interview, was employed by Mr. Stark, 
although I was a full-time member of the faculty.

03:58.574 --> 04:04.205
My salary came from Lutch Stark Boys 
Incorporated, a charitable corporation.

04:07.632 --> 04:10.898
Began my teaching career there.

04:15.552 --> 04:26.583
six years into the spring of 44, and I went into WWII 
late in the war.

04:29.305 --> 04:44.800
It got to the point where most of my friends in 
Orange, Mary Julia and I, many couples, the guys

04:29.305 --> 04:44.800
were being drafted and there were some with one and 
two children.

04:51.061 --> 04:56.290
I wasn't

04:51.061 --> 04:56.290
drafted. I

04:56.310 --> 05:10.534
told Mr. Stark, I can't wait here while all of these 
guys are going, so I'm going to ask for voluntary

04:56.310 --> 05:10.534
induction. he said well i wish you'd wait till the 
end of the school year the reason is that governor

05:11.695 --> 05:39.795
coke stevenson is going to make our commencement 
address i said mr stark my burning ambition is that

05:11.695 --> 05:39.795
i've got to go to the service he said well i'll 
understand that so i did a couple of years in the

05:11.695 --> 05:39.795
military during which time I started 
correspondence courses on a master's degree at

05:41.598 --> 05:49.786
the University of Texas in school 
administration. After the war, went back with my

05:51.427 --> 06:10.845
GI Bill, one year at UT, finished my master's, and

05:51.427 --> 06:10.845
let's see, that year was 46.

06:12.850 --> 06:13.491
J.W. Edgar at that time was superintendent of 
schools in Orange. And I had had a course the summer

06:20.057 --> 06:27.384
of 46 in which Dr. Edgar was enrolled. He was 
working on his doctorate at that time.

06:35.071 --> 06:37.173
It was a course in elementary education. At the end 
of the summer, he invited me to come to Orange This

06:42.280 --> 06:44.523
is now 46. As an elementary principle of Tilly 
School in Riverside Edition. That's

06:51.935 --> 06:53.637
T-I-L-L-E-Y. Yes. And I accepted.

07:01.229 --> 07:02.811
Mary Julia and I and Hank.

07:06.818 --> 07:09.081
At that time, our... three, oh, five-year-old. 
Hank was born in 41, and this is 46. Our

07:17.835 --> 07:24.162
five-year-old

07:17.835 --> 07:24.162
hopped in the car and headed out for Orange. During 
our ride to Orange,

07:26.424 --> 07:31.930
T.P. Baker, who was then principal of the high 
school, Accepted a job in Austin as principal of

07:36.179 --> 07:40.865
the Austin High School.

07:43.969 --> 07:51.959
And at that time, Doctor Edgar asked.

07:51.979 --> 07:54.923
Doctor Edgar, was he still Superintendent then? 
Or was it Chandler? Edgar Edgar was

07:59.749 --> 08:05.376
Superintendent then Edgar asked. WT Barrett, 
Edgar asked WT Barrett, who had been assistant

08:05.727 --> 08:15.060
principal, to take the principal's job. Barrett, 
with whom I had lived in a rooming and boarding

08:16.682 --> 08:29.760
house in Orange during my band director years and 
before my marriage in 1940, Barrett asked Doctor

08:30.685 --> 08:34.489
Edgar if he could have me as an assistant 
principal. Edgar said yes, so I never did get to.

08:38.753 --> 08:40.555
Operate as an elementary principle. I moved into 
the high school as an assistant principal. One

08:44.599 --> 08:46.682
year, Barrett went to Odessa. I moved into the 
principal's office. Just at the time when Edgar

08:51.427 --> 08:54.310
was moving to Austin. As a Superintendent and the 
new Superintendent, CEO Chandler. told me,

09:00.875 --> 09:06.421
Frank, we can't afford an assistant principal 
again. You're going to have to be the principal and

09:06.481 --> 09:11.567
the assistant principal. I agreed, of course. And 
that year was probably the most heavily loaded

09:14.010 --> 09:21.558
work year I've ever had. But nonetheless, at the 
end of 48,

09:28.988 --> 09:38.819
had an offer from the University of Texas to accept 
a research fellowship in the College of

09:28.988 --> 09:38.819
Education, working with J.G. Umstadt,

09:39.720 --> 09:58.540
a specialist in secondary education, and with 
Henry Otto, a nationwide, international, in

09:39.720 --> 09:58.540
fact, recognized guy in the field of elementary 
education.

10:01.355 --> 10:04.318
Uh, to accept this research fellowship. To start 
doing a. Start developing a procedure for the. Uh,

10:13.546 --> 10:22.394
for a school district wide evaluation program. Up 
to that time, only the high schools were evaluated

10:22.874 --> 10:30.501
for Southern Association purposes and other 
purposes. The elementary schools weren't into

10:31.190 --> 10:36.557
the act.

10:41.102 --> 10:48.652
So it was an opportunity to have the support from 
that fellowship along with my remaining GI Bill

10:41.102 --> 10:48.652
eligibility.

10:51.976 --> 11:00.707
And I accepted that fellowship, married Julia 
Hank, and by this time, Mary Catherine, who was

11:01.109 --> 11:07.135
born that year in 48. We moved to Austin, lived in 
the Bracken Ridge Apartments out near Lake

11:08.657 --> 11:17.966
Austin,

11:08.657 --> 11:17.966
a veteran's village. And it was there that I 
finished my doctoral program. During the course

11:25.414 --> 11:29.158
of that time, there was in the Texas legislature a 
momentous piece of legislation for Texas public

11:30.202 --> 11:38.115
education entitled the Gilmer-Akin 
legislation. And it revised the entire system of

11:39.617 --> 11:55.804
financing public education in Texas and revised 
the governance of public education in Texas from

11:39.617 --> 11:55.804
the state level. It did place a heavy. The 
legislation did place a heavy commitment to local

11:59.937 --> 12:05.371
control. Education.

12:10.965 --> 12:13.371
I was asked to.

12:15.781 --> 12:32.830
to work with a nucleus group before Governor 
Buford Jester of Corsicana, before Governor

12:15.781 --> 12:32.830
Jester signed the Gilmer-Akin legislation in 
June the 9th of 49. I was, a couple of weeks before

12:33.091 --> 12:41.265
that time, five of us. Read the legislation and 
began developing the processes and procedures,

12:41.549 --> 12:56.864
the forms, the applications, the rules and regs by 
which the Gilmer education Gilmer Aiken

12:41.549 --> 12:56.864
education would become operative.

12:59.647 --> 13:04.051
After that experience, Doctor Edgar was selected 
as Commissioner of Education.

13:07.014 --> 13:09.396
So he inherited me for the second time. I was 
already band director when he became

13:11.738 --> 13:19.729
superintendent in Orange, and then this time in 
Austin.

13:25.276 --> 13:35.430
I went to work for the state education agency when 
it was organized, the new education agency, and

13:25.276 --> 13:35.430
stayed there until 55.

13:38.374 --> 13:41.458
Had a call from W.B. Butler,

13:44.281 --> 13:52.652
chairman of the board of trustees for the Orange 
School District. Bill Butler was O.D. Butler's

13:55.035 --> 13:55.816
brother.

14:01.264 --> 14:06.471
Asked me to come down and interview the board 
regarding the superintendency in Orange. I went

14:07.772 --> 14:11.277
down.

14:12.016 --> 14:17.401
had the interview and was offered the position and 
accepted it. Before I went down, while still in

14:19.023 --> 14:23.307
Austin, I had a call from Mr. Stark. And he said, 
Frank, I know that you either have been or will be

14:24.408 --> 14:30.875
offered the superintendency in Archer. I just 
want to invite you to accept it. We'd like to have

14:35.239 --> 14:38.462
you back down here.

14:41.108 --> 14:52.665
I expect with his nomination and the support of the 
board, I became superintendent there in, I think

14:41.108 --> 14:52.665
in January of 55. Stayed until 59 when I had a call 
from Earl Rudder, vice president of A&M College of

14:55.149 --> 15:05.925
Texas. He invited me to come to College Station. 
Visit with him. Tom Harrington. Then the

15:18.365 --> 15:20.228
president of the system. And the University. And 
meet with the board. With the view in mind of

15:25.395 --> 15:33.206
becoming the Dean of the School of Arts and 
Sciences. At the Agricultural and Mechanical

15:34.167 --> 15:37.812
College of Texas. Mary Julia and I drove up for the 
interview,

15:39.985 --> 15:46.834
spent the day. I was interviewed by President 
Rudder, by Vice President Rudder.

16:02.075 --> 16:04.638
This was in May, incidentally, of 59.

16:07.081 --> 16:22.500
Vice President Rudder, Tom Harrington, the 
president,

16:07.081 --> 16:22.500
Boyd, the

16:07.081 --> 16:22.500
vice president for academic affairs. The name 
escapes me, I'll pick it up later.

16:30.965 --> 16:36.853
And then at 2 o'clock that afternoon, met with a 
board of directors.

16:39.497 --> 16:43.222
Sterling Evans presided as chairman. Other 
members whom I recall are S.M. Wittenberg of

16:47.348 --> 16:59.125
Amarillo,

16:47.348 --> 16:59.125
the Fort Worth guy. Maggie McGee? No.

17:03.567 --> 17:05.629
I'll pick this one up later also.

17:08.432 --> 17:15.559
In these conversations, interviews, what did you 
perceive they thought they were looking for? What

17:16.399 --> 17:17.641
did they think they needed? Well, that really 
wasn't revealed as clearly as I

17:19.602 --> 17:32.595
came to learn a few weeks later.

17:32.947 --> 17:39.376
It was apparent that they wanted someone from the 
public education sector. Why, I wasn't certain. I

17:43.743 --> 17:46.347
didn't know why, but it was clear that they did. 
During the interview, they asked me numerous

17:46.387 --> 17:59.005
questions regarding the transition of students, 
male students, from the high school period to the

17:59.423 --> 18:04.527
universities of our state.

18:08.251 --> 18:11.253
And what happened to them? What prompted them in 
their selection of a university?

18:19.861 --> 18:28.468
It was at this time, incidentally, that A&M was at

18:19.861 --> 18:28.468
a at a plateau in terms of its enrollment. Fewer 
than 7,000, all male, all military.

18:43.592 --> 18:50.020
They did not ask me any questions regarding 
military or coeducation. They did ask me some

18:51.121 --> 18:59.552
questions about my experience as a member of the 
Committee of 75 at the University of Texas. That

19:00.511 --> 19:30.096
committee had been appointed by the Board of 
Regents at the University of Texas, 75 persons

19:00.511 --> 19:30.096
from Texas and elsewhere, to make 
recommendations to the Board of Regents there

19:00.511 --> 19:30.096
regarding the nature of the university

19:00.511 --> 19:30.096
on its 75th anniversary about 10 or 12 years down 
the road.

19:33.029 --> 19:38.615
I didn't know it, but at that time Texas A&M was 
considering a similar study. And I think it was my

19:39.336 --> 19:55.734
experience on that committee of 75, which they 
picked up from my curriculum vitae, that they

19:39.336 --> 19:55.734
asked me questions about that procedure. You're 
inferring that your connection with the

19:56.295 --> 20:02.442
University of Texas was in no way a disadvantage. 
No. In no way. In fact, it was an advantage. My

20:06.386 --> 20:10.791
experience with the Committee of 75 was 
definitely an advantage. Because later on, after

20:12.973 --> 20:27.390
I came on board at A&M, President Rutter asked me to 
chair the Coordinating Committee for the Century

20:12.973 --> 20:27.390
Council.

20:30.193 --> 20:32.095
More about that later, I expect.

20:35.213 --> 20:58.521
uh went back to orange married julie and i told our 
son hank we got there just before curtain of the

20:35.213 --> 20:58.521
senior play hank was a senior told him that we were 
moving to a m he says well good for you i'm moving to

20:35.213 --> 20:58.521
rice he had just gotten noticed that day that he had 
been accepted at rice Okay, so we made the move to

20:59.092 --> 21:02.657
College Station. Let me ask a trivia question. 
This is the last time we'll talk money. What was the

21:06.502 --> 21:08.344
beginning salary offer? I think, Haskell, the 
beginning salary offered by A&M was $13,200.

21:19.159 --> 21:25.487
I took a $600 cut to make the move and orange my 
salary. Would have been beginning in the 59 year.

21:30.448 --> 21:38.658
13 eight had you and Mrs Hubert known the rudders 
when y'all were in Austin and they were in Austin. I

21:39.218 --> 21:41.761
think I had met Margaret. We did. We did not know Mr 
Rudder. I knew that he was land Commissioner.

21:53.154 --> 21:54.816
I had seen him before. in the elevator of the state 
office building at the corner of 12th

21:55.201 --> 22:03.292
and Brazos streets. That building was shared by 
the Texas Education Agency staff and the Land

22:03.913 --> 22:10.602
Commission of Texas. And I think I rode the 
elevator a couple of times with him. Was it clear in

22:15.689 --> 22:21.396
the interview that he was going to have the title 
president very soon? No. Oh. Not at all.

22:26.538 --> 22:28.000
I accepted the position. And. Began. Reported for 
work July 1st of 59. Let's see,

22:36.989 --> 22:49.061
describe describe your perception. Of the 
institution at in those early months. Well, let me

22:55.225 --> 23:01.353
say this, Haskell, first. When it was announced 
that Hubert was coming to A&M College as dean of the

23:01.373 --> 23:20.119
College of Arts and Sciences,

23:01.373 --> 23:20.119
there were some voices among the faculty of Arts 
and Sciences that were dismayed by that

23:01.373 --> 23:20.119
selection. And I can understand that. Here's a guy 
out of public education, no previous experience

23:24.908 --> 23:46.832
in higher education except through his 
responsibilities at the Texas Education Agency,

23:24.908 --> 23:46.832
coming in as dean of one of the four colleges at that 
time, one of the four colleges in A&M. and there was

23:49.192 --> 24:16.093
there was some dismay and consternation over that 
appointment

23:49.192 --> 24:16.093
but i must say that to the credit of the faculty they 
were patient and tolerant and took a wait-and-see

23:49.192 --> 24:16.093
attitude and i think by the end of the first year

24:18.976 --> 24:28.788
there was a good relationship between the dean's 
office, the heads of the departments, and the

24:18.976 --> 24:28.788
general faculty in the School of Arts and 
Sciences. I think that existed.

24:36.657 --> 24:44.747
I had had the good experience in the Texas 
Education Agency of being the director of the

24:36.657 --> 24:44.747
division which had all of the state agency 
responsibilities with colleges and

24:45.115 --> 24:54.008
universities engaged in teacher education. And 
that was every one of them. And in fact, I had

24:57.654 --> 25:12.135
chaired an evaluation committee, which

24:57.654 --> 25:12.135
Dr. Edgar had established

24:57.654 --> 25:12.135
growing out of the legislation. to approve the 
teacher education programs, not accredit them,

25:13.634 --> 25:38.275
but to approve them

25:13.634 --> 25:38.275
for teacher certification purposes and for 
degree purposes, because at that time, the salary

25:13.634 --> 25:38.275
schedule was attached to the degree one held and 
the year's experience of teaching. I had the good

25:40.128 --> 26:07.350
fortune of knowing 95%

25:40.128 --> 26:07.350
of the presidents of colleges and universities in 
Texas, senior colleges and universities in

25:40.128 --> 26:07.350
Texas, many on a first-name basis, simply by 
virtue of the experience of having been on their

25:40.128 --> 26:07.350
campus for three days to a week chairing an 
evaluation team, and in their office practically

26:07.820 --> 26:13.587
every day during that period of time. That was a 
rich set of experiences for me to take with me in

26:14.589 --> 26:19.395
this job. And knowing the presidents, I also knew 
the principal academic officers of the

26:19.995 --> 26:28.326
institutions.

26:35.562 --> 26:51.169
During my interview at A&M

26:35.562 --> 26:51.169
with Boyd Page,

26:35.562 --> 26:51.169
I asked Dr. Page, I said, it's

26:51.189 --> 26:58.482
most unusual for a university to go to a secondary 
school program and select a superintendent of

26:59.812 --> 27:14.020
schools to be an academic dean, especially in the 
field of arts and sciences. Does President Rutter

27:15.624 --> 27:17.106
know? No. Not President Rudder. Does Mr. Rudder 
and Harrington and the board know what the

27:23.076 --> 27:27.602
consequences might be? Have they considered that 
aspect of this appointment? Page grinned and

27:34.311 --> 27:48.870
chuckled, and he said, yes,

27:34.311 --> 27:48.870
I think they've weighed at some, but they're 
willing to take the risk if they get the right

27:34.311 --> 27:48.870
person. I didn't know what the right person meant. 
But nonetheless, I raised that question and got

27:51.548 --> 27:56.393
that response.

28:03.060 --> 28:05.363
Well, I'm at A&M. I'm the dean of the School of Arts 
and Sciences. And let's see. I learned at about

28:12.691 --> 28:19.178
this time, early after arriving at A&M, I learned 
that then President Rutter, after I arrived there

28:20.052 --> 28:36.188
July 1 as dean, on that same date, Vice President 
Rutter was named president of the university.

28:39.131 --> 28:47.239
Now, I learned that President Rutter had called 
J.W. Edgar. Those two had known each other

28:49.837 --> 29:01.674
principally, I think, because of having shared 
the same office building in Austin over a period of

28:49.837 --> 29:01.674
a few years.

29:04.659 --> 29:15.895
President Lutter called Commissioner Edgar and 
said, J.W.,

29:04.659 --> 29:15.895
I need to bring somebody to Texas A&M who is 
knowledgeable about the Texas public school

29:16.887 --> 29:24.674
system and particularly the high schools of 
Texas. We here at A&M need to improve our

29:26.536 --> 29:37.106
relationship with the secondary school sector.

29:37.126 --> 29:46.675
Will you give me some names of people who might be 
prospective candidates for such a job? And he

29:48.562 --> 30:00.522
said, I think, he said, the position I have open at 
this time is the dean's job in the School of Arts and

29:48.562 --> 30:00.522
Sciences.

30:06.552 --> 30:14.586
Excuse all of this coughing, clearing of one's 
throat.

30:17.823 --> 30:21.468
Dr. Edgar gave President Rutter two names. One was 
Bascom B. Hayes, H-A-Y-E-S,

30:23.151 --> 30:34.968
with whom I had worked very closely in the State 
Education Agency and who was a close friend. He and

30:35.730 --> 30:45.484
his wife Donnie and Mary Julia and I

30:35.730 --> 30:45.484
spent many evenings together, a dear close 
friend. He nominated Bascom Hayes, who at that

30:47.152 --> 30:59.025
time, I believe, was superintendent of schools in 
Freeport.

31:05.432 --> 31:09.516
And he

31:05.432 --> 31:09.516
nominated me. I was then superintendent of 
schools in Orange.

31:16.430 --> 31:27.182
I think one of the reasons I was invited to be 
interviewed first was a degree. I had a PhD degree.

31:30.566 --> 31:33.089
Bascom Hayes had an Ed D degree. In fact, when I 
decided to go back to the University and. After WW2

31:38.755 --> 31:44.682
and pursue graduate education. I committed 
myself to a PhD track because I knew at some time if I

31:45.708 --> 31:59.507
had an opportunity to go into higher education, it 
would be much more valuable than an EdD.

32:04.153 --> 32:06.576
Dr. Edgar recommended those two names. I was 
invited first to be interviewed, and on the same

32:06.776 --> 32:14.787
day of that interview was offered the position.

32:18.513 --> 32:29.952
And so that was the basis for my becoming

32:18.513 --> 32:29.952
a candidate for the position at A&M. And that's a 
sketchy

32:31.314 --> 32:41.270
history of my before-A&M days, Haskell. You got 
here. in the summer of 59 what was your perception

32:43.133 --> 33:10.035
of the institution in those early weeks and months 
well first let's let's talk early weeks oh okay did

32:43.133 --> 33:10.035
you lie the first summer session i don't know what 
the enrollment in summer session was in in 59, but

33:11.905 --> 33:19.120
my first impression of A&M was there's nobody 
here. I could walk across the campus and not see a

33:21.184 --> 33:24.591
single individual. Where are they?

33:36.273 --> 33:43.020
That was a strange

33:36.273 --> 33:43.020
occurrence to me.

33:46.304 --> 34:06.145
I came to realize that, number one, summer session 
enrollment at A&M was a downturn enrollment, and

33:46.304 --> 34:06.145
two, I had already known that the general 
enrollment at A&M had been slow to change, and

34:07.795 --> 34:27.521
that became the basis for my

34:07.795 --> 34:27.521
concern about the all-male, all-military 
phenomena.

34:33.349 --> 34:37.414
Over the long range, my perception of the 
university

34:39.419 --> 34:57.201
as an all male, all military institution, was

34:39.419 --> 34:57.201
one of working within that framework and trying to 
do the best I could within

34:39.419 --> 34:57.201
that environment. I recall my first experience at 
registration time in the fall of 59. In those days,

35:09.743 --> 35:18.638
registration for the entire university student 
body was accomplished in one day. One

35:18.678 --> 35:25.249
day. All of the departments and colleges went to 
Sabisa Hall where tables were arranged. by

35:37.030 --> 36:05.535
departments by colleges all around the hall 
students were first admitted by the registrar's

35:37.030 --> 36:05.535
office and then then they came into the hall to make 
out their their schedule of courses and we made

35:37.030 --> 36:05.535
every student's schedule during that one day of 
registration time and that was it there was a

35:37.030 --> 36:05.535
course added additional time for ads and drops 
later on. But registration was accomplished in

36:10.086 --> 36:12.630
one day. I thought that was amazing. There were 
long lines. But they became shorter and shorter.

36:24.069 --> 36:28.156
But the thing that was impressive to me was that the 
College of Arts and Science. The school of Arts and

36:29.899 --> 36:32.603
Sciences faculty.

36:35.553 --> 37:05.323
they were running

36:35.553 --> 37:05.323
uh each a member from each table would be running 
around what's the enrollment going to be what does

36:35.553 --> 37:05.323
it look like this year can you tell any difference 
are we going to make 7 000

36:35.553 --> 37:05.323
well it was uh i think a great disappointment when 
when they didn't make seven thousand that seemed

36:35.553 --> 37:05.323
to be a goal out there somewhere And, of course, at 
this same time, Mrs. Post, WWII, and the other

37:06.738 --> 37:18.116
colleges and universities in the state were 
skyrocketing enrollment, just going high.

37:25.747 --> 37:26.549
Well, that was it. Early on, I was introduced by 
President Rutter as the new dean to a group of

37:35.122 --> 38:03.627
former students who were meeting at the msc i think 
there was a group of about 20 24 i don't know what

37:35.122 --> 38:03.627
unit it was from the former students but president 
rudder asked me to come over and be introduced to

37:35.122 --> 38:03.627
them as the new dean in the school of arts and 
sciences I did and

38:04.180 --> 38:10.209
they asked me to make a few comments.

38:14.215 --> 38:28.517
And

38:14.215 --> 38:28.517
I, without any temerity what so all, I said to the 
group, incidentally when I entered the room It was

38:29.763 --> 38:30.203
a. Coffee break period and all of the talk was. 
Football.

38:39.332 --> 38:42.215
Small groups here and here and here football.

38:45.998 --> 38:51.283
Well, with no temerity at all, I I suggested in a 
very pleasant. I think diplomatic and tactful

38:52.524 --> 38:54.846
way. Let. I had come to Texas A&M to accept this 
position because of my strong belief in a good,

38:59.412 --> 39:11.430
sound academic program at a major university. I 
said, I think the potential is here, albeit I've

39:13.638 --> 39:25.396
been here such a short time, the potential is here 
for great improvement in that direction. I would

39:27.019 --> 39:38.076
hope that the former students would turn their 
attention to a concern for the for the academic

39:38.815 --> 39:45.401
development and improvement at the university. I 
didn't say give it as much attention as you do

39:46.062 --> 39:49.845
athletics. I didn't even mention the word. But I 
did put in a plug for the academic side of the house

39:52.808 --> 40:06.460
for quality faculty.

40:09.072 --> 40:10.073
What was their reaction? That was it. The reaction 
was favorable, really favorable. I think I saw a

40:16.439 --> 40:38.320
few startled faces when I made this opening, but

40:16.439 --> 40:38.320
I do think that the reaction was very favorable. 
President Rutter didn't comment on my remarks,

40:40.696 --> 40:49.209
but I didn't expect him to. At any rate, that was my 
first introduction to a former student group.

41:02.389 --> 41:04.813
And my perception was that

41:12.404 --> 41:35.847
That the general tenor,

41:12.404 --> 41:35.847
the general feeling in the School of Arts and 
Sciences principally among the faculty was that

41:12.404 --> 41:35.847
we are basically a service institution.

41:37.362 --> 41:56.991
agricultural and mechanical college is not 
likely to open up for the arts, humanities,

41:37.362 --> 41:56.991
and except as it's important to engineering, the 
sciences. Incidentally, let me tell this story

41:58.793 --> 42:06.484
about one of our department heads in the College 
of, in the School of Arts and Sciences. I learned

42:07.165 --> 42:19.223
during my first year here that Chester Klippel, 
head of the mathematics department, they're so a

42:07.165 --> 42:19.223
great guy, kind.

42:25.111 --> 42:25.712
I learned that when the College of Engineering 
would put into their degree program an advanced

42:26.553 --> 42:51.196
course in some engineering class that required a 
heavy support of mathematics, he would go

42:26.553 --> 42:51.196
audition that course for the entire semester. Sit 
in the classroom. with the students to find out

42:56.253 --> 43:04.361
just what kind of mathematics that course 
required. And if it required an adjustment to the

43:05.342 --> 43:12.670
curriculum in the Department of Mathematics, 
he'd go back and make that adjustment. I thought

43:12.690 --> 43:25.062
that was fantastic from the standpoint of taking 
the responsibility of providing service courses

43:12.690 --> 43:25.062
seriously. In my, I wished I had located a copy of 
it, but I haven't. I'm talking about a copy of my

43:33.825 --> 43:46.201
first meeting, a copy of my speech comments to the 
faculty in the School of Arts and Sciences at my

43:33.825 --> 43:46.201
first meeting with them. I think it was in October 
of 59.

43:54.455 --> 43:59.019
I was very apprehensive before that meeting. I 
didn't really know what to expect.

44:09.849 --> 44:12.352
I had a prepared speech. I've got a copy of it 
somewhere. I want to find it. But during that

44:17.517 --> 44:23.382
speech, I did make the point with some emphasis. 
that the School of Arts and Sciences

44:25.572 --> 44:51.056
had two basic missions,

44:25.572 --> 44:51.056
the lesser of which was the service course 
situation. But I think I emphasize also that we

44:51.695 --> 44:58.104
needed to take that responsibility seriously. 
And

45:00.288 --> 45:16.892
to say that good engineers needed good science and 
good English and good communication skills and so

45:00.288 --> 45:16.892
forth.

45:24.905 --> 45:45.823
But then also that each one of the disciplines 
within the college

45:24.905 --> 45:45.823
had a right to prime time, mainly because of its 
disciplinary nature and the field of knowledge

45:24.905 --> 45:45.823
which it represented. Without that knowledge, 
the campus would be incomplete.

45:57.727 --> 46:20.882
And

45:57.727 --> 46:20.882
my perception was that the faculty really had 
been, I don't know how to, had been

45:57.727 --> 46:20.882
underappreciated

45:57.727 --> 46:20.882
for

45:57.727 --> 46:20.882
so long.

46:23.495 --> 46:30.546
that they

46:23.495 --> 46:30.546
felt that way, Haskell. I don't know whether 
that's accurate or not, but it occurred to me that

46:30.566 --> 46:38.778
among some quarters that happened.

46:41.543 --> 46:48.032
When you completed your remarks, how did you feel 
about your success in getting the message across?

46:48.453 --> 46:49.755
I felt okay about it. Because I was with a small 
group, we walked not too far behind you as you

46:50.090 --> 47:04.527
walked back to the Nagel Hall office, and we 
thought that you felt you had gotten across the

46:50.090 --> 47:04.527
message you wanted to. We were giving you a high 
mark. Well,

47:08.051 --> 47:18.544
I remember C-squared Doak. came up to me after the 
meeting dr duke was head of the department of

47:19.199 --> 47:48.818
biology

47:19.199 --> 47:48.818
he came up to the to me after the meeting and he says 
something

47:19.199 --> 47:48.818
like this uh

47:19.199 --> 47:48.818
i feel we're fortunate to have You as our new dean,

47:50.047 --> 48:05.052
you have shown intelligence and tact and I'm eager 
to work with you.
