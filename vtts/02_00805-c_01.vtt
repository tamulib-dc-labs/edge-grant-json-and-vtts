WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:04.571
Okay, this is a continuation of the interview. 
Mary Hicks was the first one. She was the first one.

00:15.722 --> 00:21.468
The second was Mrs. William Kirksey, 
K-I-R-K-S-E-Y.

00:23.511 --> 00:30.578
We were extremely important to Mrs. Kirksey in 
that she had been an army librarian. She was a

00:32.634 --> 00:38.202
graduate of Peabody College in Tennessee and 
extremely well trained. Her husband was a captain

00:39.043 --> 00:47.515
with 12 years service who was presently in 
veterinary school. Mrs. Kirksey applied at the

00:49.057 --> 00:59.772
main library and about the time Mrs. Hicks turned 
in her resignation, So

01:01.507 --> 01:10.278
we had a second well-trained librarian. During 
Mrs. Kirksey's tenure,

01:10.298 --> 01:29.303
the library was moved from the

01:10.298 --> 01:29.303
main campus to the site west of the tracks where it 
is still located.

01:32.388 --> 01:44.987
There was no money,

01:32.388 --> 01:44.987
or at least Mr. House, the librarian, said there 
was no money for extra help.

01:49.354 --> 01:55.022
So the various departments paid student labor for 
a short time. And then Mr. House decided that the

01:56.405 --> 02:01.332
main library could take over payment of student 
labor. So it was a welcome help for Mrs. Kirksey and

02:04.398 --> 02:20.553
served the additional purpose that many students 
were acquainted with library procedure who

02:04.398 --> 02:20.553
otherwise would not have been able to.

02:24.637 --> 02:30.222
Following Mrs. Kirksey, who left when her husband 
graduated, Incidentally, they are now located in

02:31.197 --> 02:39.164
Fort Worth, where he's a successful 
practitioner.

02:39.184 --> 02:48.153
We've had several well-trained librarians up and 
into and including the present.

02:53.578 --> 02:59.263
The advent of the medical school

02:53.578 --> 02:59.263
here gave the veterinary library an

03:00.155 --> 03:08.325
enormous boost. And its name was changed from the 
Veterinary Medical Library to the Medical

03:09.466 --> 03:17.136
Resources Library. Gave it an enormous boost in 
which way? In demand on it and demand for services,

03:20.600 --> 03:28.930
I should say. It is now, as I am almost sure, still 
known as the Medical Resources Library, which

03:29.348 --> 03:46.975
includes Budner Medicine as well as Bowles 
College of Medicine. And that's about all there is

03:46.995 --> 03:48.618
to it. We just started from tall and built up. 
Right, right. And on the committee, you were

03:53.446 --> 04:02.559
basically in charge of the relationship between 
the university's libraries and the School of Vet

03:53.446 --> 04:02.559
Medicine. Yes. And also probably ordering books 
and things like that. Well, I rubber-stamped

04:06.565 --> 04:10.972
them, but I wasn't questioned. Our book orders 
primarily came from demand or request by student

04:11.272 --> 04:20.145
faculty, and if this fellow is an annoyed student, 
expert in the field, who would I be to question it?

04:24.361 --> 04:27.406
So it was a matter of rubber stamping. 
Occasionally, we'd have some of the students want

04:28.507 --> 04:41.565
to bring in things, for example, like newspapers 
or whatnot, or fiction. We thought that was a part

04:41.765 --> 04:43.667
of the main library. In other words, we kept a 
pretty close touch on what was really should

04:50.483 --> 04:53.586
belong in the veterinary library over in the main 
library. We had no intentions of expelling a

04:53.626 --> 05:01.673
student because you walked into the main library. 
In fact, we encouraged them to go over there. And

05:05.596 --> 05:11.882
Mr. House was extremely sympathetic

05:05.596 --> 05:11.882
to the veterinary library. And when he found that 
we in the veterinary library end of it fucked the

05:11.902 --> 05:19.849
way we did about the main library, we had no 
trouble. We were parallel rather than

05:20.470 --> 05:30.922
competitive.

05:30.942 --> 05:35.768
Now I would imagine that the budget that you had to 
buy books grew tremendously. Yeah, primarily

05:36.829 --> 05:42.256
because, you know, a librarian lives by 
statistics. Any librarian. If you got a library

05:44.038 --> 05:48.503
with 10,000 books there and nobody used it, you're 
in a pretty bad way. So as the use increased and

05:49.512 --> 05:54.960
demand for books increased, of course the budget 
increased. And the budget went through the main

05:54.980 --> 05:58.766
library. We were a part of Cushing Memorial 
Library.

06:06.899 --> 06:12.347
Now, were there any other committees that you 
served on for a time like this? What were the most

06:12.968 --> 06:20.036
important ones, or what would you consider the 
most important, and let's talk about those and

06:12.968 --> 06:20.036
your duties on those. Well, I was 15 years on the 
Veterinary Library Committee. I was 20 years on

06:24.220 --> 06:31.228
the Annual Conference for Veterinarians, which 
is no longer held.

06:36.274 --> 06:37.896
Why isn't that held? This is a national 
conference? No, it was statewide. It's no longer

06:42.567 --> 06:44.189
held for two reasons. First,

06:44.270 --> 06:57.710
the AVMA, I mean the TVMA, the Texas Veteran 
Medical Association, wanted to move their

06:44.270 --> 06:57.710
meetings around. It started here way back there 
when Dr. Francis was here. This was the focus

07:04.720 --> 07:09.267
of all meetings. For years, all the Texas 
Veterinary Medical Association meetings were

07:10.107 --> 07:14.292
held at College Station. And then they started 
holding the winter meetings. And

07:18.256 --> 07:28.127
rather than the strict business meeting, the 
meeting at College Station evolved into a

07:18.256 --> 07:28.127
conference or seminar type meeting. And then as 
the state grew in number of veterinarians,

07:39.672 --> 07:59.234
And as the number of students grew here,

07:39.672 --> 07:59.234
we thought it would be wise to discontinue it and 
turn it over entirely to the Texas Veterinary

07:39.672 --> 07:59.234
Medical Association and be their 
responsibility. But it served a need through the

08:00.295 --> 08:05.741
years, the war years and on through. Well, why 
wasn't it continued then? I don't know exactly,

08:09.980 --> 08:21.859
except that, as I said, there

08:09.980 --> 08:21.859
was a phenomenon known as continuing education, 
which reared its head. And

08:23.261 --> 08:38.164
these continuing education seminars were held 
various places through a various time of year, and

08:23.261 --> 08:38.164
it pretty well superseded the purpose of the 
conference as such. Okay, what other main

08:40.034 --> 08:46.743
committees? Well, of course, I was on the 
selection committee five long years. And what

08:51.670 --> 08:52.751
were your duties there?

08:55.595 --> 08:59.941
Trying to figure out who was lying to me and who 
wasn't when they said you only wanted to be a

08:55.595 --> 08:59.941
veterinarian.

09:03.046 --> 09:04.327
In other words, selected students. Yes. That was a 
no good job. Why not?

09:10.797 --> 09:17.526
How would you like to pick out 60 boys out of 300 and 
say that you're in and you're out? Yeah.

09:20.931 --> 09:21.792
It was no good. We stayed out there night after 
night. And then it got to big that we couldn't have

09:25.778 --> 09:35.030
personal interviews, so they... Oh, you had 
personal interviews to begin with? Yes. Until

09:36.112 --> 09:37.173
when did you stop? Oh, I don't remember, but 
stopped about the time I went off the board. But

09:41.223 --> 09:48.994
then we went over their academic list and threw out 
those that were hopelessly no good. I mean,

09:50.135 --> 10:00.790
ineligible, I wouldn't say they were no good, but 
they were maybe too old or maybe they had a sorry

09:50.135 --> 10:00.790
academic record or various other things. And then 
they started interviewing those who might

10:01.732 --> 10:07.800
possibly have a chance. So I don't know. I don't 
know, I haven't been on it for 25 years now. You were

10:15.278 --> 10:18.463
on it back in the 1940s? Yeah, when it first 
started.

10:23.030 --> 10:26.115
When Dr. Dunn was dean and later when Dr. Boughton 
was dean. Dean at that time was chairman of the

10:28.279 --> 10:30.883
selection committee. Then he got smart and 
assigned it to a faculty member so he wouldn't

10:32.124 --> 10:37.032
catch the flake.

10:44.707 --> 10:48.111
How long were your interviews with each one of 
these students back in the 1940s? We'd try to take

10:48.412 --> 10:50.074
10 a night. 10 interviews a night? Give them about 
20 minutes, I guess. I know we'd get out there at 7,

10:55.300 --> 10:57.603
8, or 12. And how many would interview? Well, there 
were always five of us there. We interviewed in a

11:05.913 --> 11:07.736
group. This one little old boy would come in and 
meet five staff at church there. And if he knew

11:13.040 --> 11:18.506
anything at all, he usually was scared out of him 
before he started. But I remember one time, one of

11:18.526 --> 11:27.937
the interviewers asked

11:18.526 --> 11:27.937
an applicant, were you in the service? He said, 
yes, sir.

11:32.162 --> 11:34.044
He said, what branch of the Army were you in? The guy 
said, the Marines, sir, not Army. So things like

11:38.930 --> 11:40.532
that. We'd try to get acquainted with them, find 
out if they knew any veterinarians and why they

11:40.985 --> 11:46.353
wanted to be a veterinarian. Of course, we knew the 
answer to that, because they'd always wanted to be

11:46.373 --> 11:49.818
a veterinarian. What are you supposed to do after 
you're out? Go back to my hometown and practice.

11:55.706 --> 11:57.249
Will you be large animals or small? They'd all say 
large animals, so a lot of it was just routine

11:57.269 --> 12:01.755
questions. The main idea just kind of tied them up 
as the type of boy. general overall appearance and

12:10.364 --> 12:13.809
cleanliness and neatness. Of course, that was 
sort of a deal, too, because anybody would be

12:13.889 --> 12:22.282
stupid that wouldn't get a haircut and shave 
before they went in to interview. But we did the

12:22.622 --> 12:34.199
best we could, and I'm sure we turned down some very 
good boys, but we had the consolation of we didn't

12:22.622 --> 12:34.199
let many in that didn't make the grade. And that was 
our main deal, was to not waste placed on somebody

12:39.963 --> 12:46.593
who wouldn't make it.

12:46.613 --> 12:50.178
Well, I would imagine that your attrition rate was 
very low. It is. It was and is. Oh, they drop out

12:51.781 --> 13:03.258
because of illness or unavoidable accidents or 
things, but, and the attrition rate of graduate

12:51.781 --> 13:03.258
veterinarians is really low. The veterinary 
profession, as such, don't lose near as many from

13:08.380 --> 13:10.483
their ranks to even the MDs. Really? That's right. 
Once you're a veterinarian, you're usually...

13:11.845 --> 13:18.734
How can you account for that? I can't account for 
it. I'm just telling you a fact. That's really an

13:21.939 --> 13:23.441
interesting fact.

13:30.391 --> 13:31.432
It is really interesting. I thought it would 
probably be pretty close for both veterinarians

13:31.512 --> 13:35.237
and MDs. Well, I don't know now in 19... 1979, 1980, 
but in... In the 1960s. Yeah. Okay. Now, how about

13:46.281 --> 13:48.403
some other committees that you served on? No, I 
don't remember. After all, when you've been there

13:50.586 --> 13:54.870
31 years, you've served on practically every 
committee. Okay, okay. We tried to rotate

13:58.534 --> 14:00.477
committees around. I was on the library committee 
and the chairman of the conference along with me.

14:06.565 --> 14:11.291
The Library Committee is 15 years to a day and the 
Congress Committee was 20 years. And I've been on

14:13.293 --> 14:34.598
the curriculum with him from time to time and on 
various other things, but he

14:13.293 --> 14:34.598
has had a department and

14:13.293 --> 14:34.598
being there that long while I had a chance, most 
committed one time or another. Right. Okay, now I

14:41.038 --> 14:43.320
have another question. With the growth of the 
number of veterinarians, there are also a rapid

14:44.201 --> 14:55.331
growth of the number of people in the professional 
staff, especially after the Second World War.

14:56.252 --> 14:56.712
Yes. And I was wondering what impact these 
professional staff members had on the College of,

14:56.732 --> 15:05.040
or School of Veterinarian Medicine. I don't 
understand, what do you mean impact? I think it's

15:08.856 --> 15:11.439
tend to upgrade it.

15:18.669 --> 15:30.005
We had our first, as I remember, DVM was also PHDs 
along about that time. And I also remember that

15:30.025 --> 15:35.753
along about the 1950s Maybe in the 60s we had our 
first PhDs without the DVM for things like, as I

15:36.425 --> 15:52.189
mentioned, biology, bacteriology,

15:36.425 --> 15:52.189
and so forth. OK. We've talked about quite a few 
changes in the School of Veterinarian Medicine.

15:59.880 --> 16:00.561
What have I missed? I think you've covered it 
pretty good. Is there anything else? I mean, we've

16:05.197 --> 16:14.833
talked about the specialization, the broader 
curriculum, women, and increasing number of

16:05.197 --> 16:14.833
students and research and faculty and 
enrollment. Is there something else that we

16:14.853 --> 16:21.805
should, do you think that perhaps you had a role in 
something else that you think that we should? No, I

16:21.825 --> 16:24.049
think I covered it pretty well. Okay, then as a 
final question, would you mind just reflecting on

16:24.822 --> 16:32.193
the service that you had here at Texas A&M? What do 
you think some of the accomplishments or high

16:32.213 --> 16:45.171
points you had were, and what do you think some of 
the things, I don't want to call them low points,

16:32.213 --> 16:45.171
but some of the things that you feel that could have 
been done better? Well, this is the high point, of

16:45.772 --> 16:49.377
course.

16:52.181 --> 16:53.243
I mean, as far as Oh yeah, that's beautiful.

17:01.184 --> 17:04.347
And when did you receive the Faculty 
Distinguished Achievement Award? It's on the

17:04.808 --> 17:05.829
back. On the back of the watch. 1964.

17:19.144 --> 17:22.167
Well, one of the things that always bothered us, of 
course, was actually lack of money. Like I said, we

17:28.861 --> 17:32.604
were always a day late and a dollar short. And I was a 
one-man department through the war years. Sure.

17:40.751 --> 17:49.519
And then we got a little money and we were able to get 
technicians to actually prepare the specimen

17:40.751 --> 17:49.519
instead of having to go back at night and do it 
yourself. And

17:49.539 --> 17:53.622
the highlights were that My dad sold insurance, my 
mother talked all the time, so I had to get the jab,

17:55.745 --> 18:24.570
and I was quite interested in veterinary 
parasitology, and I was invited to talk at various

17:55.745 --> 18:24.570
state meetings across the United States, and I've 
been in at all the veterinary colleges that were

18:26.204 --> 18:30.949
established at that time.

18:36.734 --> 18:48.386
And I guess the high point was when I got to go to 
Germany to the International Veterinary Medical

18:36.734 --> 18:48.386
Association to give a paper on parasites of the 
horses. Really? When was that? That sounds

18:50.608 --> 18:51.629
fascinating. When was I in Germany, honey?

18:57.878 --> 19:03.645
I don't remember, 1950s

18:57.878 --> 19:03.645
or early 60s. And then I have been on other 
international veterinary programs. I went to

19:10.934 --> 19:14.779
Mexico City and went to 1950 in Lima, Peru. And I 
enjoyed those, first because I got my expenses

19:16.100 --> 19:22.488
paid. Sure, and you got to see part of the world.

19:28.574 --> 19:51.723
The one thing that

19:28.574 --> 19:51.723
I did that was probably pretty well among the first 
at Texas A&M, now at the commonplace, was that I got

19:28.574 --> 19:51.723
a leave of absence and got to go to Peru to help 
establish the experiment station for the

19:28.574 --> 19:51.723
Peruvian government. And I was down there one 
semester in 1954. Really? And they didn't have any

19:56.460 --> 19:58.623
type of experiment? Oh, they had one, but they 
wanted to pattern it out in the United States, and I

19:58.643 --> 20:07.635
helped set up the operators.

20:11.841 --> 20:20.633
They did the operation as well as they could, but 
that had a lot of frustrations because it was a

20:11.841 --> 20:20.633
whole lot like dropping a die into a fast-running 
brook. You could see it cover for a minute and then

20:21.614 --> 20:24.298
it'd be gone. You mean the Peruvians didn't have 
the training, or what were the problems? Both, and

20:31.378 --> 20:35.465
it's just a type of personality, for example.

20:39.972 --> 20:47.183
Peruvians, I guess like many Spanish-Americans,

20:39.972 --> 20:47.183
pretty much a family unit. So they were on the 
personnel of an experiment station. There were

20:52.211 --> 20:53.813
several families. Consequently, there were 
several kids. And these kids made pets out of the

20:57.715 --> 20:59.657
animals. They'd take a corn cob and go up to a big 
bramble bull and rub him. He'd lay down until you

21:03.621 --> 21:05.443
rub him all over. And

21:05.463 --> 21:12.450
one morning, a big bull had through arms in his ear. 
And I was going to treat it. And the chute was just

21:19.036 --> 21:23.901
made out of actually flimsy wood. And I said, we 
better put a rope on him and put it around this tree.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.421
That chute won't hold him. And they just laughed. 
Oh, El Toro was gentle. Well, I reached up and

21:35.808 --> 21:41.134
grabbed his store here, and he exploded, and 
little pieces of chute went everywhere. And he

21:42.375 --> 21:43.737
trod off. He was gentle, but he just didn't like to 
be handled. So I said, well, let's get a rope on the

21:47.961 --> 21:49.763
tree. And they said, oh, well, we can do that 
tomorrow. And that's the way it was all the time.

21:56.163 --> 22:01.889
And I had a little boy help me get fecal samples to 
examine for evidence of parasitism. And I

22:02.810 --> 22:06.414
couldn't make him understand why he should wash 
his hands between each sample. So I wouldn't get

22:07.775 --> 22:09.397
the samples mixed up. He said, they're already 
dirty. Why wash them? In other words, that was it.

22:16.164 --> 22:18.867
There was a cultural and a language gap then, both. 
But I felt like I did a little good. Who knows? I've

22:26.952 --> 22:30.355
always wanted to go back and see, but never had a 
chance. Do we have much of a, does Texas A&M have

22:31.457 --> 22:38.465
much of an international program? Yeah, the 
school as such does. I mean the School of

22:43.731 --> 22:46.394
Veterinary Medicine. No. Mm-hmm. So in other 
words, we never bring in foreign students? Oh

22:52.549 --> 22:54.291
yeah, they're sent here. I'll tell you, you can 
talk to the international guy out here. I forget

22:58.797 --> 23:00.779
who he's in charge of now. But we have students from 
other places, mainly there for advanced degrees.

23:08.429 --> 23:15.137
In fact, I've had several Filipino students that I 
really, really admired. I had quite a few

23:16.218 --> 23:18.381
Pakistani students that I didn't think so much of, 
but kindly. Why not? Oh, I don't know. Their

23:25.994 --> 23:28.017
personality is just different. Oh, I see. But the 
Filipinos you got along with. Oh, yeah. Why was

23:32.042 --> 23:32.562
that? Well, I don't know. They're just likeable 
cousins.

23:38.650 --> 23:42.695
We had a fellow from Ireland come over and stay with 
us six months. I don't know what program he was on,

23:42.775 --> 23:47.181
whether Ireland was paying for it or whether he was 
on a state deal. He was a lot of fun. Where was he

23:49.462 --> 23:50.263
from? Dublin. Oh, Dublin. Robert P. Lee. He was 
always butting because if he had known he was going

23:55.950 --> 24:00.535
to come here, he'd have changed it to Robert E. Lee. 
We had a lot of good fellas.

24:12.329 --> 24:14.592
Is there anything else you think we should 
discuss? Oh, I think that ought to close it up.

24:16.989 --> 24:20.136
There's a lot of information I can't give you like 
foreign students. Oh, we can get that from other

24:20.777 --> 24:22.460
sources. There's no problem there. Okay, this 
ends our interview with Dr. R.D. Turk. Thank you

24:26.929 --> 24:27.711
very much. Yes, sir.
