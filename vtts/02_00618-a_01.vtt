00:12.434 --> 00:14.857
That tape didn't run its full 30 minutes, which is 
all right. You're sure you're getting a

00:14.977 --> 00:16.439
recording, aren't you? Because it's not so 
irritating as to record and get nothing. That's

00:19.062 --> 00:19.503
right. I'm sure I am. We can check that out. All 
right, as long as you're sure. Well, anyway, as I

00:22.727 --> 00:28.555
say, my wife suggested to him that he ought to do 
something about the fireplace and get it

00:22.727 --> 00:28.555
enlarged. And a week or two later, he came round and 
said, my wife asked him whether he'd done

00:29.456 --> 00:34.502
anything. He said, yes, I've done something. She, 
from the wording of it, she was a little

00:36.485 --> 00:39.088
suspicious. She said, what have you done, Harold? 
Well, he said, there are two ways of keeping warm in

00:42.758 --> 00:45.021
a room. One is to have a larger fireplace, and the 
other is to get closer to it. And he said, what I've

00:50.109 --> 01:04.049
done is I've had the curb around the fireplace put 
closer to the fireplace, so that I always sit on the

00:50.109 --> 01:04.049
floor, and I can now get closer to it, and the heat 
goes off as the inverse square, so I shall keep

00:50.109 --> 01:04.049
warm. But anyway, he took to coming round almost 
every evening to the apartment we had in

01:08.223 --> 01:15.813
Cambridge. He'd stand out in the street and shout 
until we let him in. So we had this, what I regarded

01:20.519 --> 01:23.162
as an old gentleman. He was only in his 40s, but I was 
in my early 20s. And he used to come round and talk

01:27.327 --> 01:30.752
about geophysics and so on. I learnt a lot from him. 
Well, then my main thing was I decided to widen the

01:33.415 --> 01:38.061
ranges Essentially, the thing was called the 
Department of Geodesy and Geophysics, but it was

01:38.733 --> 01:49.167
really only concerned with lecturing to 
undergraduates on surveying and measuring

01:38.733 --> 01:49.167
gravity. And I started off to add seismology. And 
we also added a little terrestrial magnetism. I

01:56.957 --> 01:59.661
made gravity measurements when I was in East 
Africa. and the seismology was a big project. And

02:02.951 --> 02:09.840
then I met this character, Dick Field, who said, I 
must go to sea and do some seismology at sea. And he

02:10.300 --> 02:16.629
arranged for me in 1937 to go out to sea with Maurice 
Huey. This is the first time I'd been to America. I

02:19.132 --> 02:25.962
came to America in the summer of 1937, and I went out 
to sea with the Coastal Geodetic Survey. I went...

02:28.733 --> 02:53.155
around the east coast with field we were driving 
down i remember to see the geophysical lab in

02:28.733 --> 02:53.155
washington and i said you know i'm sorry always 
sorry that as a student i never did any geology oh

02:28.733 --> 02:53.155
it's absurd you must learn some geology come on 
we'll go and learn some geology um and we rushed off

02:28.733 --> 02:53.155
instead of going to the geophysical lab in 
washington we rushed off in the other direction

02:53.624 --> 03:04.601
And he took me over the Appalachian section in 
which he'd done his PhD between Harrisburg and the

02:53.624 --> 03:04.601
Belfonte up to State College. This wonderful, 
beautiful section through a slightly folded

03:04.622 --> 03:09.149
mountain range. And he showed me what geology was 
about. He really did teach me enough geology to

03:12.214 --> 03:21.268
know what it was about and to make me believe I can 
make up the rest. Anyway, then he sent me out to sea

03:22.025 --> 03:33.500
with Ewing, and Ewing, by this time, he'd been 
doing some work on the continental shelf, and this

03:22.025 --> 03:33.500
was his first foray beyond the edge of the 
continental shelf. And I've given an account of

03:34.521 --> 03:37.885
this in the thing I wrote about Ewing.

03:40.769 --> 03:44.514
And we had a most interesting time in this little 
vessel. She was a sailing vessel, an auxiliary

03:44.534 --> 03:49.180
engine, the Atlantis from Woods Hole. And this was 
my first trip in an oceanographic vessel. My

03:55.368 --> 03:57.913
trouble as an oceanographer has always been that 
I'm seasick. And these little vessels didn't

03:58.955 --> 04:01.139
really suit me. But we had an extremely 
instructive time. I've given an account in that

04:03.243 --> 04:08.653
paper of how we decided we needed cast TNT instead 
of flake TNT, and we made it on board the ship by

04:08.920 --> 04:23.013
heating up TNT in an electric coffee pot and 
pouring it into paper bowls, and all kinds of

04:08.920 --> 04:23.013
improvisations of the sort. And Ewing was a man 
after my own heart, but as I say, I've written about

04:23.033 --> 04:28.778
him, and I owe a great deal to him. And then I went 
home, and the next year I went out to sea with a man

04:28.798 --> 04:36.885
called Tom Gaskell, and Ben Brown had been doing 
the gravity in submarines. We'd already, before

04:37.270 --> 04:41.334
we met Field, decided to do gravity measurements 
for submarines. And we did our first seismic work

04:41.955 --> 04:52.447
on the continental shelf and found these great 
thicknesses of sediments, which had also been

04:41.955 --> 04:52.447
found by Ewing over on the east coast of the United 
States. And this was the great discovery of the

04:53.027 --> 05:07.243
enormous sedimentary thicknesses, 10, 20, 30, 
40,000 feet, some places 10 kilometers of

04:53.027 --> 05:07.243
sediment, which, of course, are the home of the 
offshore oil. And it's interesting that the oil

05:11.029 --> 05:15.335
companies at the time were not the least 
interested. Ewing tried to get money off an oil

05:15.375 --> 05:22.225
company to look for the thickness of the sediments 
off the east coast of the United States. And they

05:22.926 --> 05:24.989
weren't interested at all. The chairman of 
Standard Oil simply said, there's plenty of oil in

05:25.029 --> 05:32.100
the Middle East. We can buy the oil we want. There's 
a good deal of oil in Texas. We're all right. And

05:37.177 --> 05:40.201
they had no idea what was going to happen. And it 
shows the difficulty of prediction. Because

05:43.907 --> 05:45.208
these people weren't foolish. They knew their 
business. They were making a lot of money. But you

05:48.052 --> 05:55.623
couldn't see that far ahead that there were going 
to be these troubles and you'd need to look for oil

05:48.052 --> 05:55.623
at sea. It's an interesting sidelight, I think, on 
the nature of industry before the war. I mean, now

06:02.232 --> 06:04.456
you'd have no trouble at all. I don't think you'd 
have much trouble I mean, the minerals companies

06:06.893 --> 06:11.059
now are looking at minerals at sea.

06:13.923 --> 06:16.547
They don't need very much persuading. But then it 
was really very different. Well, anyway, we

06:20.032 --> 06:24.038
worked on this up to the war. We got a good section of 
the thickness of the sediments out to the edge of

06:24.078 --> 06:28.665
the continental shelf. And we started to turn our 
thoughts to all kinds of other things. I got

06:33.707 --> 06:36.892
interested in heat flow, first of all on land. I had 
a graduate student working on land. And I went to

06:39.837 --> 06:44.144
South Africa before the war and did measurements 
of heat flow in the mines. And I thought of a method

06:45.106 --> 06:48.632
of doing this at sea. I thought of this before the 
war, but war came too soon. And so we didn't do it

06:53.019 --> 06:54.822
before the war. Now, how much do you want me to... 
Let's stop there. You asked me other questions

06:58.513 --> 07:00.737
about the pre-war period. Right. I don't want to go 
into the war until I've come to work with the

07:01.297 --> 07:05.463
submarine. You've already made a comment on how 
Cambridge compares today with Cambridge 45 years

07:05.744 --> 07:10.290
ago. Would you see Cambridge now as more 
specialised than it was when you went to school

07:10.330 --> 07:17.681
there? No, I think less so. In the sense that if 
we're talking about... Are you talking about the

07:25.025 --> 07:32.657
undergraduate course or the sort of things that 
graduate students sort of research and so on? Sort

07:32.677 --> 07:33.979
of things graduate students do, really. Well, no, 
I think less specialized. You see, at that time,

07:36.603 --> 07:44.837
Rutherford had this single-minded devotion to 
the nucleus, nuclear physics. Now, the interest

07:45.998 --> 07:51.387
has broadened a great deal. If one takes a look at 
the Cavendish today, they're doing a great

07:51.704 --> 07:56.611
variety of things. They're interested in a great 
deal of solid state work, low temperature work,

07:57.192 --> 08:06.666
electron microscopy, all kinds of things. And I 
would say that generally, graduate students have

08:07.267 --> 08:17.762
a broader knowledge of what science is about. I 
mean lots of them now of course go into biophysics.

08:21.629 --> 08:26.440
This is the big thing that's had this tremendous 
development. Earth science, the sort of thing

08:26.641 --> 08:37.725
I've been engaged in, and molecular biology are 
the great revolutions of the post-war period and

08:26.641 --> 08:37.725
to some extent astronomy. These are things all on 
the periphery of physics. They're not the central

08:41.376 --> 08:46.862
core of particle and nuclear physics, as 
Rutherford saw physics. They are things that are

08:46.982 --> 08:48.885
peripheral. And these have had this tremendous 
development. And this has, I think, affected

08:51.948 --> 09:05.383
people's whole attitude to science, that now one 
looks for the growing points on the periphery of a

08:51.948 --> 09:05.383
subject rather than the central core of it. 
physicist you're taking a very big gamble because

09:07.743 --> 09:34.611
you may turn out to be Einstein but you'll probably 
spend your time doing rather trivial things in a

09:07.743 --> 09:34.611
very competitive field with a very large number of 
other people and students are bored with this a few

09:07.743 --> 09:34.611
I always ask graduate students when they want to 
come and work with me why they want to come and work

09:07.743 --> 09:34.611
with me and why they don't do something else And in 
the old days, I'm talking about 20 years ago, they

09:35.182 --> 09:47.539
used to say, well, you know, I've come to realize 
that I'm not good enough for particle physics or

09:35.182 --> 09:47.539
for solid state physics. And Mr. Somebody or other 
advised me to come and see you. Nowadays, they say

09:50.983 --> 09:54.488
something different. I say, why don't you go into 
particle physics? They say, it's so dull. I'd like

09:59.154 --> 10:01.898
something that's growing and interesting where I 
can make an impression. And of course, also, this

10:02.857 --> 10:11.004
is hitched on to this vague feeling that students 
have for what they call relevance. I don't think

10:11.765 --> 10:14.187
they know what they mean by relevance quite. But 
they mean something which is connected with what

10:14.808 --> 10:31.463
they see as the real world, what they see as human 
interests, particularly human interests in

10:14.808 --> 10:31.463
pollution, the state of the world, energy, all 
these things. So I think the attitude of students

10:32.101 --> 10:35.725
has changed. In my day, as a student, it was felt to 
be a definitely second best choice not to go into

10:36.626 --> 10:50.422
the central core of physics, the developing study 
of the nucleus and of particles. And this has

10:50.702 --> 10:53.125
changed. Is that...? Yeah, yeah. I'm struck by... 
by your ability to write, which is rather unusual

11:00.383 --> 11:04.567
for American scientists, if I may say so. Is this a 
product of your sort of classical education, or

11:05.208 --> 11:10.152
did you have a classical education? Well, let me 
say, I was an extremely unsuccessful schoolboy. I

11:15.918 --> 11:21.303
was, as a small boy, age of 10 or so, I was extremely 
disturbed. I don't quite know why. In any case,

11:23.405 --> 11:26.728
it's not relevant to your inquiry. I was unhappy at 
home, unhappy at school, for no real reason. And I

11:32.182 --> 11:50.927
got very behind hand, and my parents took me to some 
kind of primitive psychiatrist or psychologist,

11:32.182 --> 11:50.927
and he said, take him away from his day school, send 
him away to school, to boarding school. And I think

11:51.127 --> 11:54.572
the man must have had in mind that he wanted to get me 
out of what was obviously for me a difficult

11:54.907 --> 12:00.535
environment. And I think it was partly the great 
anxiety of my parents that I might be a very

12:00.555 --> 12:09.026
low-grade person. My father never believed I 
could earn my living. Well, anyway, I went away to

12:13.132 --> 12:24.087
school and quite suddenly I felt released and I was 
put into the bottom form two or three years below my

12:24.539 --> 12:26.121
age. And in two, three years, I went right up to the 
top of the school. No trouble, no trouble at all.

12:35.434 --> 12:36.896
Most extraordinary transformation. And 
curiously enough, an identical thing has just

12:37.597 --> 12:46.049
happened to my grandson, who refused to learn to 
write about the age I was in trouble. And his mother

12:46.890 --> 12:48.893
said, Did he do something? So I got him into the same 
school. What public school did you go to? I went to

12:54.089 --> 12:55.491
Repton. I went to Repton at the age of 14. And I 
disliked it for the first two or three years. Then I

13:02.502 --> 13:05.407
sort of came to terms with it. And it was a good 
school in a very old fashioned sense. They didn't

13:09.794 --> 13:11.176
bother much about you. They left you alone. You 
could do what you liked. I had strong mathematical

13:15.586 --> 13:18.570
and physical interests. I didn't pay much 
attention to anything else. And I was more or less

13:21.635 --> 13:26.021
in a way self-educated. And I suddenly realized 
that I could, in fact, no one would worry much what I

13:26.722 --> 13:31.569
did. And I got, in England at that time, there was a 
critical exam that you took 16, 17. I was still a bit

13:40.502 --> 13:43.146
behind and I took it at 17. Well, I disliked him 
intensely. I'm just telling the story. It shows my

13:47.331 --> 13:51.215
sort of attitude to authority at that time. I took a 
dislike to my foremaster. And we quarreled a good

13:54.037 --> 13:56.660
deal. And I remember he asked us to write an essay on 
what historical character we'd most like to have

13:56.680 --> 14:02.005
met. And I thought, I'll tell him what I think of 
him. So I sat down and I wrote an essay which started

14:05.788 --> 14:11.293
with the reasons for not wishing to meet any of the 
historical characters that he admired. I said the

14:15.050 --> 14:19.676
Duke of Wellington and Napoleon were little 
better than murderers. A view I don't hold now of

14:20.237 --> 14:23.081
the Duke of Wellington. And went through a list of 
all the people he'd held up to us as admirable, and

14:23.902 --> 14:31.432
said I wouldn't have made any of them if I'd been 
paid to. And the man I'd have liked to meet was

14:31.872 --> 14:34.516
Faraday. Well, then the man lost his temper over 
this, wrote a piece at the bottom, saying, you

14:38.712 --> 14:42.876
beastly little boy, public school education is 
thrown away on you. And I had this thing framed and

14:43.437 --> 14:46.000
hung up in my study. And I haven't got it now. I lost 
it when I left school. But anyway, I was pleased

14:49.803 --> 14:53.808
with this and thought I was definitely making 
progress. And then I came out one from bottom. I was

14:57.631 --> 15:00.895
22nd out of 23 in this form at the end of the year. But 
fortunately, the prize for the year was given on

15:01.616 --> 15:07.842
the results of a public examination. in which I 
came top. So when the results were read out for all

15:10.050 --> 15:19.825
the school and the parents, the headmaster read 
out, Bullard, 22, Snooks, 23, four-prize

15:10.050 --> 15:19.825
Bullard. I thought I'd definitely scored off this 
man. I mean, an absolute fool, of course. He got me

15:25.072 --> 15:26.775
bottom of the four. But this is an answer to your 
question in the sense that I must have been able to

15:27.262 --> 15:34.874
write, you see, and make things plausible. And the 
man was very nice to me. He asked me, the form master

15:37.137 --> 15:45.490
asked me to go around to tea and I went around there 
and he said, look, it's clear I've made a mistake

15:37.137 --> 15:45.490
and I hope you don't hold it against me. And we were 
good friends after this. But anyway, it was a funny

15:49.756 --> 15:57.248
sort of school, sort of ill-organised, do what you 
like. I remember when I was, the next year after

15:57.308 --> 16:09.148
this, I was not in the top form, one from the top 
form, and I went in for, it was an engineering

15:57.308 --> 16:09.148
prize, and I went in for it, I thought it would be fun 
to, and So I went in for the engineering prize and

16:09.533 --> 16:11.855
came out top. I thought it was nice, I got the prize. 
Not a bit of it. The headmaster, who afterwards

16:14.718 --> 16:27.371
became Archbishop of Canterbury, ruled that I was 
ineligible because I was in the fifth form and not

16:14.718 --> 16:27.371
in the sixth form, and that the man in the sixth form 
who'd come second in the exams would get the prize.

16:27.411 --> 16:29.433
Well, I thought this was a joke. I mean, it seemed to 
me funny. I thought the headmaster, who had a

16:31.395 --> 16:37.161
rather perverted sense of humour, disregarded 
this as funny and wanted to see how I'd react. And so

16:38.069 --> 16:42.034
I went round to my house master and I told him this as 
a joke. I said, you know what Elsans has done? And I

16:43.656 --> 16:44.397
explained. And he said, you know why he's done 
this? And I said, no, I suppose he thought it was

16:48.522 --> 16:50.244
funny. No, he said, it's not that. There's a cup for 
the house that gets most prizes. And we are neck and

16:57.593 --> 17:00.516
neck with his house. And as a story about an 
archbishop, I thought it was instructive. Yes. I

17:07.144 --> 17:09.226
got to know him later on when he was archbishop. I 
got to know him a bit. And we were good friends. I

17:13.050 --> 17:18.096
asked him down a few months before he died to give a 
talk at Churchill College in Cambridge. He came

17:18.116 --> 17:19.597
and talked to undergraduates. And he chose to talk 
on ethics. And he gave the most wonderful talk. He

17:23.261 --> 17:24.442
was the greatest fun. He really was a very 
entertaining man. He was the best after-dinner

17:27.366 --> 17:29.608
speaker in England. And really, very good fun. 
This is Fisher, Dr. Fisher, Archbishop of

17:34.699 --> 17:38.483
Canterbury. The other memory I have of him is that 
we used to have a scripture lesson on Sunday

17:38.503 --> 17:43.329
mornings. And there was some miserable little man 
who used to take us to scripture. I remember his

17:47.134 --> 17:48.556
name, but I won't repeat it. Anyway, this was a 
shambles. We were supposed to be reading a book,

17:50.919 --> 17:54.043
the book of Isaiah. And we all took in things that 
interested us. I remember there was a man took in a

17:58.580 --> 18:02.565
journal called Engineering, which is about the 
same size as the Los Angeles Times. I used to sit

18:03.266 --> 18:08.914
reading this in the front row, and I used to scratch 
my head about mathematics and so on. We were all

18:08.934 --> 18:14.081
getting on with our own affairs, and Manuel was 
running it, obviously didn't mind much what we

18:08.934 --> 18:14.081
did. He read some book of his own. And one day, the 
headmaster, Fisher, came in and said he proposed

18:16.144 --> 18:22.292
to hold an examination. We'd all put our books 
away, of course, as soon as the capital would go on.

18:26.216 --> 18:29.459
We were wondering how on earth this chap would run 
things and get out of this. And he said to

18:30.440 --> 18:39.210
headmaster, you know, the boys are very 
interested in Isaiah, and we shan't be able to

18:30.440 --> 18:39.210
finish the book and have an examination. I would 
really like them to finish it and not have the

18:39.230 --> 18:44.155
examination. And the headmaster sort of grinned. 
He obviously saw what was going on and went out

18:45.757 --> 18:48.460
again. Well, I'm trying to give the picture of a, 
entirely disorganized school, see, that went in

18:53.120 --> 18:58.585
this extraordinary way. And then at the end of my 
school days, I had to get into Cambridge, and I had

18:58.645 --> 19:05.451
to take a Latin examination. And I hadn't done, I'd 
stopped doing Latin when I was about 12 or 13. And so

19:09.395 --> 19:13.118
I read all 14, something of that sort, and I really 
didn't know any Latin at all. So I decided, in the

19:13.378 --> 19:18.643
term before this exam, to devote a substantial 
amount of time to learning Latin. Then I got

19:19.524 --> 19:20.545
measles. and I wasn't allowed to read, and I was 
only left with three weeks to learn Latin. And I

19:26.692 --> 19:36.504
went round to see a man who I knew taught Latin, who I 
knew slightly faster, and I said, look, can you

19:26.692 --> 19:36.504
teach me Latin, enough Latin, to get through this 
exam in three weeks? Oh, he said, sure, of course,

19:37.065 --> 19:39.207
no problem. He said, come round to me every 
evening, and I'll send a bill to your father. And I

19:43.473 --> 19:44.414
said, well, that's all right. And so I went round to 
him every evening for about half an hour, First

19:48.267 --> 19:51.532
evening we got in, he said, well now, set for 
Horace's odes. Here's the Latin, here's the

19:52.694 --> 19:54.837
English. You learn the English off by heart as far 
as you can. You know enough Latin words to know

19:57.922 --> 20:01.147
which ode you've got. And with knowing just a 
little Latin, you should be able to pick your way

20:01.989 --> 20:05.394
through. Oh, he said, by the way, don't bother with 
these three. They won't ask those. And I said, why

20:11.082 --> 20:11.783
not? Oh, he said, they're obscene. So I said, well, 
listen, look, I read the English text. I said, I

20:16.689 --> 20:18.211
can't say anything obscene about them. What's 
wrong with them? Oh, he said, you see, that's a

20:19.933 --> 20:22.717
boy's name. They'll never say anything about 
buggery to a public school boy. He said, you can

20:26.402 --> 20:32.189
safely omit those.

20:32.569 --> 20:36.955
I mean, by modern standards, very odd system of 
education, but it suited me. to be left to my own

20:37.745 --> 20:39.947
devices, so to speak. Well, I think I got 
interested in writing properly in this

20:39.967 --> 20:45.494
environment. I mean, it was one of the things that 
was highly regarded and which a lot of trouble was

20:45.734 --> 20:51.700
taken about. And later on, Lance Cunningham was 
very fussy about how I wrote things, and this man

20:52.461 --> 21:00.510
Jeffreys I talked about. It was a thing which was 
not regarded casually. It was regarded... as

21:07.090 --> 21:12.877
perhaps the most important part of education, to 
learn to write grammatically correctly. And I

21:13.718 --> 21:18.985
know what's gone wrong with American writing of 
students.

21:21.829 --> 21:27.195
You quite properly start off with small children 
to teach them that they can express themselves.

21:27.235 --> 21:28.797
You don't bother much how they do it. You tell them 
to write about their pet cat or something of this

21:28.817 --> 21:35.646
kind, and you don't much worry whether they spell 
cat with K and how it's done. But the trouble is this

21:36.588 --> 21:52.229
goes on all through school and all through 
college, that there's a very high value put on

21:36.588 --> 21:52.229
self-expression as against formal correctness 
of writing. And I had an interesting example of

21:52.249 --> 21:54.232
this. A young lady in my class here in San Diego 
wrote a midterm test which was literally

21:54.893 --> 22:06.088
unintelligible.

22:06.862 --> 22:10.427
sort her out, and said, I can't grade this thing. 
And she said, why not? I said, because it doesn't

22:11.488 --> 22:12.810
make any sense. And she said, what do you mean? I 
said, well, just read it to me. And we sat down, and

22:16.355 --> 22:18.939
she read it to me. And after a little while, she 
said, I said, what do you mean? It doesn't make

22:21.122 --> 22:22.344
sense, does it? I said, no, it doesn't. She said, no 
one's ever said this to me before. It's

22:27.351 --> 22:29.534
interesting. They all thought I wrote like I 
wrote, and that was that. And I said, well, Look, it

22:36.528 --> 22:38.251
isn't any good, is it? I said, you go away and do two 
more questions that I'll give you. Take your time,

22:43.800 --> 22:52.213
do what you like, get anyone's advice you like, ask 
your dog, anyone, and come back next week with it.

22:52.234 --> 22:53.355
She came back and got an A. She suddenly realized. 
It had never, I think, entered her head that there

22:55.639 --> 23:01.168
was any more problem in writing than there is in 
speaking. She thought it was a thing you did

23:01.688 --> 23:06.935
spontaneously, and the first thing that came into 
your head was the best way to do it. And I think it is

23:07.736 --> 23:17.690
the realization that writing is an art, is a 
conscious effort, which I think your students are

23:07.736 --> 23:17.690
missing. Such a high value is placed on 
spontaneity of expression, that the fact that

23:18.792 --> 23:30.548
writing is not, that apparent spontaneity in 
writing is obtained with great difficulty, but

23:31.000 --> 23:38.070
People like,

23:31.000 --> 23:38.070
what's the man's name, the man who wrote Ulysses? 
Joyce. Joyce, yes. I mean, it's apparently, he's

23:40.053 --> 23:44.639
the source of this kind of thing. It's done with 
enormous subtlety, and it's obviously been

23:44.699 --> 23:48.565
rewritten dozens of times. This realization just 
hasn't got through. It's the school's fault. They

23:53.411 --> 23:58.138
aren't insisting that people write 
intelligibly. Well, anyway, you asked me about

23:59.401 --> 24:02.967
what I thought about writing in America and 
England. I think it's just more trouble is taken in

24:02.987 --> 24:06.152
insisting on correct writing. And you think, 
then, that you're typical of this product rather

24:06.573 --> 24:09.638
than... I think so. I mean, maybe I've had more 
practice than most people. I mean, I've written an

24:12.683 --> 24:14.266
awful lot.

24:22.039 --> 24:22.860
The book... How did you come to invent the 
geophonic device you used in your work? I had that

24:28.041 --> 24:31.448
appearing in the 30s in work with Strada. Oh, this 
is this... I know what you're talking about.

24:35.155 --> 24:35.876
You're talking about geophones. Yeah. Well, when 
we were working on land and seismology, we had no

24:37.679 --> 24:44.292
money. So we had to make our own geophones. I don't 
think we invented anything. It was pretty obvious

24:47.800 --> 24:50.003
how to do it. They existed. I mean, there was the 
wear seismographs being used by all companies and

24:51.185 --> 24:55.170
so on. And we thought a bit about how they should be 
designed and how they were made. And we made one,

24:59.236 --> 25:03.202
and then we had to make one to use at sea. And the 
trick about this was it had to work either way up,

25:04.324 --> 25:09.111
because you couldn't determine which way it went 
down the sea floor. We started the first year

25:09.151 --> 25:13.317
putting them right way up on the sea bottom, which 
is quite a trick. And then we decided that's too

25:13.668 --> 25:16.911
much nuisance and made ones that go either way up. I 
was very lucky. I had an extraordinarily clever

25:18.573 --> 25:20.955
assistant. He was a boy who'd left school at 15, had 
taken a course in machining. He was a mechanic, a

25:28.183 --> 25:31.506
machinist. And he was about the cleverest man I'd 
ever met. And this was a nice thing, at least it was

25:35.370 --> 25:41.616
nice for me in the 20s and 30s, were a whole lot of 
people who fell off the educational ladder, who

25:41.984 --> 25:47.311
were extremely intelligent. And the result was 
that you could get very intelligent people as

25:47.331 --> 25:51.738
assistants. Whereas now, of course, this man 
would have been chairman of General Motors or

25:53.520 --> 26:01.511
something, or a banker, or God knows what he was. In 
fact, my mechanic. And I always felt he was much

26:03.454 --> 26:05.697
cleverer than I was. And he did very well during the 
war, which is another story we might come to. But he

26:10.633 --> 26:11.955
had no ambition at all. He insisted after the war on 
coming back and working as a mechanic. Very

26:16.582 --> 26:17.243
curious. When you go to East Africa, did you 
deliberately go there on a scientific

26:18.525 --> 26:23.372
expedition? And if so, who sent you? Well, I sent 
myself, essentially. We developed these methods

26:27.638 --> 26:32.325
of measuring gravity with pendulums for 
considerable improvement on them. If anyone

26:32.626 --> 26:37.851
wants to know how it was done, they can read the 
paper in the philosophical transactions. And

26:38.732 --> 26:41.996
East Africa is a very odd place. Some friends of 
mine had been there looking at the Rift Valleys

26:42.276 --> 26:50.104
from a geological point of view, and biologists 
and so on. So I knew a little about East Africa. It

26:51.966 --> 26:52.626
was accessible. It was a British colony. The road 
system was sufficiently good to travel about in

26:55.850 --> 27:01.215
it. a certain number of height measurements, 
which were important. There'd been leveling

27:04.143 --> 27:05.765
along the railway. There'd been a triangulation. 
It was just in a sufficiently developed state to do

27:07.547 --> 27:10.972
gravity measuring. A little had been done already 
by a German in Tanzania, which was formerly a

27:10.992 --> 27:18.843
German East Africa, a man called . And it has the 
rift valleys, which I was interested in. And so I

27:22.809 --> 27:28.857
chose it for its scientific interest plus the 
practicability of the project. And I went out with

27:29.495 --> 27:39.270
my wife, and we traveled around in a truck, slept in 
the truck, took all the equipment in the truck, and

27:29.495 --> 27:39.270
a couple of natives, who was a cook and his 
assistant. And we spent several months there

27:39.851 --> 27:42.575
traveling around. It was really a tremendous trip 
around with all this equipment.

27:52.750 --> 27:57.257
Well, so that I mean, one of the things we had to do, 
generally speaking, was to build our equipment,

27:57.473 --> 28:00.676
you see, because you couldn't. We had no money to 
buy equipment. Now, I always try, if you can buy

28:03.719 --> 28:06.021
equipment, you buy it. And, of course, 
equipment's much more available now. The whole

28:08.704 --> 28:10.926
scientific enterprise is so much bigger. And all 
the things like cathedrals, scilographs,

28:11.627 --> 28:19.254
analog-digital converters, all these things are 
available on a big scale. Well, look, we've only

28:20.235 --> 28:26.181
just, you know, we've been talking about it now, 
and we've only just got to the point where I talk

28:20.235 --> 28:26.181
about oceanography.
