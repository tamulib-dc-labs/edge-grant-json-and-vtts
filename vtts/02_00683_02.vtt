00:01.550 --> 00:06.496
fields, the funding priorities that have changed 
so much. And consequently, all this stuff kind of

00:07.657 --> 00:10.480
focuses. And it's really hard to feel great about 
the growth in math and science when you haven't had

00:10.500 --> 00:19.091
any growth. OK.

00:19.111 --> 00:25.498
On question number nine, or eight or nine, can you 
think back to some of the highlights or maybe what

00:26.052 --> 00:33.642
you feel has been your biggest contribution? And 
in light of that, maybe an insight or an anecdote or

00:35.204 --> 00:44.757
an observation or something that sort of focuses 
what you feel good and... And I know there's a lot of

00:35.204 --> 00:44.757
good things. As you can tell by the Saturday's 
comments, I have not felt real good about what's

00:44.777 --> 00:50.865
going on in recent times. Right, right. But... The 
finest times I had here were when I was able to work

00:53.491 --> 00:59.178
closely with underground. That's something I've 
not been able to do for a long time. The

01:03.603 --> 01:17.018
cohesiveness that we had seems to have been lost, 
but there have been various times when different

01:03.603 --> 01:17.018
groups have been really cohesive and they've been 
a lot of fun to work with. You can't make him. No one

01:19.764 --> 01:21.166
wins all the time. So that's not an altogether bad 
thing. I was very proud of what we were doing in

01:26.352 --> 01:30.117
educational technology. I thought we were 
bringing together people and moving it forward

01:30.137 --> 01:38.727
quite well. And I thought the research that was 
underway was right at the forefront. And I was

01:41.811 --> 01:43.172
really very proud of it. So that hurt.

01:47.980 --> 01:49.041
curious, giving it up.

01:54.126 --> 02:16.890
And we do have, still, a real strong, loyal group of 
doctoral graduates who continue to send us

01:54.126 --> 02:16.890
outstanding students and encourage them to come 
and work with us and who follow them with great

01:54.126 --> 02:16.890
interest.

02:18.052 --> 02:21.315
strong and second to none, I think. Can you tell me 
just a little tiny bit about the focus of what you

02:23.717 --> 02:28.261
will be doing now? Well... And how you feel about 
that effort? The part that's dealing with the

02:34.727 --> 02:47.299
development and advancement program for the 
college is exciting and challenging and most

02:34.727 --> 02:47.299
ambiguous. Because there's no part of it 
structured at this

02:47.650 --> 02:53.835
point. The amorphous problem of trying to sort out 
what the priorities of the college are, who might

02:53.855 --> 03:07.487
be interested in which priorities, who might deal 
with what will be resolved. So I have some

03:07.507 --> 03:14.193
apprehensions there, like anyone does when they 
approach something new. This is a field that I've

03:14.213 --> 03:16.695
not dealt with before. I look forward to having 
more time to work with my graduate students. I

03:23.871 --> 03:36.405
found the department headship interfered 
substantially in my ability, one, to do any of my

03:23.871 --> 03:36.405
own research, and also to give them the kind of time 
and support that they need. And will this be what

03:36.425 --> 03:40.590
your research will be focused on then, what you 
will be doing? I would hope that my research is of

03:41.731 --> 03:46.817
interest to graduate students. And I would hope to 
attract graduate students who wanted to do the

03:47.135 --> 03:51.500
kind of research that I'm doing. Are you talking 
about the development type? No. Oh. No. But the

03:55.705 --> 04:11.083
research that I'm interested in in technological 
literacy or in relationships between education

03:55.705 --> 04:11.083
and work, the industrial training and 
development work, are areas where I have not had a

04:11.519 --> 04:18.589
chance to do enough active research to get 
graduate students who wanted to do that kind of

04:11.519 --> 04:18.589
research. The project that I'm working on right 
now with development is not something graduate

04:19.670 --> 04:26.219
students can work on. That's why I was confused. 
No. OK. They're really two different things. All

04:30.004 --> 04:30.445
right. And you worked with the Development 
Council, or you were part of it since the very

04:30.825 --> 04:37.054
beginning. Can you give me just a couple of 
sentences on how you feel that that has evolved, or

04:37.338 --> 04:44.467
did evolve, or where it could go?

04:47.611 --> 04:54.039
Collison College has never clearly specified 
what it wants from the Development Council. It's

04:54.059 --> 05:00.587
been very satisfied at times with what it got, and 
very dissatisfied at times with what it got, and

04:54.059 --> 05:00.587
nobody knows why.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.071
Until the The college gives the Development 
Council a clear statement of priority. It's

05:09.523 --> 05:10.985
unlikely that we can get it. The thing that is being 
confused at the Development Council is advice and

05:13.768 --> 05:19.375
advancement. If you want a group for advice, you 
give them the problems you're seeking advice

05:19.395 --> 05:23.960
about. If you want a group for advancement, you 
outline the program that you have in mind and seek

05:24.080 --> 05:30.688
their assistance. And we've confused the two. 
That's what I think I've learned so far. OK. In

05:38.167 --> 05:43.812
closing, you have any words of wisdom or anything 
that you want to bring closer? Well, I'm sure

05:43.832 --> 05:48.036
you're going to find lots and lots and lots of 
variation in perception. Oh, absolutely. The

05:48.997 --> 05:54.923
College of Ed, in my opinion, has made enormous 
strides in the 12 years that I've been here. It has

05:55.223 --> 06:02.830
not, however, decided whether it wants to be a 
top-flight research college or whether it wants

05:55.223 --> 06:02.830
to do teacher education. and in what mix it wants to 
do them. It's quite appropriate that it do both,

06:07.371 --> 06:15.261
but it's still trying to define where it wants to be 
in that sense too. That at least is getting some

06:15.962 --> 06:19.907
attention this year, some real active attention. 
I think if we can come out of that with clearer

06:20.007 --> 06:29.239
answers, we stand a chance then of being much 
stronger in the future. You think that new

06:30.029 --> 06:33.914
upheaval and all those changes might bring that 
about? It could. I think it really could. Because I

06:37.198 --> 06:42.645
think the faculty are far more versatile than 
their performance would indicate. And if we

06:43.486 --> 06:54.200
decided we really wanted to have a research base in 
areas that don't currently have a research base,

06:43.486 --> 06:54.200
we could get that. I sure do thank you for your 
perceptions and your contribution to this study

06:59.273 --> 07:06.465
and I hope that I can come back and ask you some more 
questions as I start trying to analyze all the
