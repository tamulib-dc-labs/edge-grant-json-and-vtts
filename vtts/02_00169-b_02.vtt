00:02.292 --> 00:11.023
Rural values help offset some of the extremes that you might find in the cosmopolitan urban type of thing.

00:11.043 --> 00:16.990
And I think our country has benefited from rural mores, rural values, and so forth.

00:17.891 --> 00:27.203
If you had the financial capability to make a major contribution to Texas A&M, for what cause or causes would you give?

00:29.090 --> 00:30.532
of your own resources.

00:30.612 --> 00:33.115
You mean irrespective of extension or anything?

00:33.135 --> 00:36.760
It could be, you name it, it could be anything, extension or anything else.

00:36.780 --> 00:41.526
Well, as I said, a part of this relates to my extensive international experience, Haskell.

00:41.907 --> 00:57.848
You go into some of these, I've worked in India, I've worked in some of the poorest countries in Africa, and we talk about the Green Revolution, and we try to help people in all of this, and you see the missionaries that work in these areas, you're often run into them, Peace Corps types and everything.

00:59.532 --> 01:07.239
But ultimately, I come down on the side that none of these things will matter unless we get some population under control.

01:07.259 --> 01:09.461
I mean, this is my big thing.

01:09.481 --> 01:20.431
And if I had, you know, the money that our friend has, Gates has, or something like that, I think we need an international effort.

01:20.832 --> 01:27.818
And to me, it's not a matter of, the only thing I find correlated with the population

01:29.063 --> 01:31.306
control is education of women.

01:32.508 --> 01:35.031
And I think this is so essential throughout the world.

01:35.091 --> 01:41.220
If women could be given access to more education, they would take more control of their lives.

01:41.320 --> 01:50.312
And it's, you know, when you see Africa, you know, and South America and other places, the land they're trying to bring into production should never be touched

01:51.102 --> 01:58.338
you know, and it just causes environmental disaster, you know, what's happening to our wildlife in Africa and all of these things.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.443
It's all population pressures.

02:00.503 --> 02:06.597
I mean, when you have, in Kenya, the average woman has eight point something children, the average woman, I mean,

02:06.577 --> 02:10.482
Zimbabwe's population has more than doubled since they became independents.

02:10.502 --> 02:11.724
That's only been 20 years ago.

02:12.204 --> 02:13.326
I mean, something's got to give.

02:13.726 --> 02:19.874
I mean, you know, AIDS has gotten into that picture.

02:19.954 --> 02:32.010
That's, you know, one of the things that you find out in Africa that was so disillusioning to me that even the best educated leaders in Africa, Western educated

02:32.767 --> 02:40.796
find it very popular to imply that this was a white man's conspiracy developed deliberately.

02:40.956 --> 02:46.582
And I mean, the top respected politicians repeat this line in the newspaper and everything.

02:46.602 --> 03:00.057
But I really feel strongly in terms of the nation, the hemisphere, and the world as a whole that this uncontrolled population growth, I mean, you just make any projections that you want to.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.076
Something's got to give.

03:02.196 --> 03:15.209
I mean, it's, you know, I look at India, having worked there, their population at that time was increasing a million a month, surpassing People's Republic of China, I think, in a few years.

03:16.651 --> 03:28.963
And you see them, you go out into the rural areas, people existing on five, six hundred calories a day, they can only work three, two or three hours and they're completely exhausted, which you would be too if you didn't get that many calories.

03:29.095 --> 03:31.540
That's my own personal big issue.

03:32.301 --> 03:49.753
I would, you know, there's so much missionary work going on in the world, I've often almost gotten to the point where I sometimes resent my contributions going in that direction because I don't think they, I mean, it's fine to try to, you know, persuade people

03:50.273 --> 04:00.583
in terms of this, but I think there's so many other ways you can help them through general education and let them make their decisions as to what they believe in terms of religion and so forth.

04:00.603 --> 04:06.209
But there are great abuses in terms of the missionary activity I've seen in the field.

04:06.309 --> 04:12.335
I mean, if people would know that, I think they sometimes wonder if their money was being widely spent.

04:12.755 --> 04:16.399
And from an anthropological standpoint, I have some problem with trying to

04:17.223 --> 04:20.368
say to somebody, your religion is wrong and mine's right.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.933
What right do I have to say that, you know?

04:24.574 --> 04:34.129
Now, you can provide them education, opportunities and so forth and let them make the decision, but it's, anyway.

04:34.770 --> 04:35.651
All right, last question.

04:36.252 --> 04:40.058
Looking back over all these years, to whom do you feel most grateful?

04:41.793 --> 04:43.476
I guess Dr. Hutchison.

04:43.496 --> 04:44.919
Well, no, it could be more than one.

04:44.939 --> 04:45.640
Oh, more than one.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.103
Dr. Hutchison, certainly.

04:48.044 --> 04:51.471
Some of my early professors, like Dr. Harrington.

04:52.472 --> 04:52.713
M.T.

04:52.733 --> 04:53.134
Harrington?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.316
Yeah.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.502
He was one of the best teachers that I ever had.

04:58.063 --> 05:00.527
People like Dr. Adrians, Dr. Bryson,

05:01.570 --> 05:05.239
listen to me when I was a freshman type of thing.

05:05.400 --> 05:13.200
And of course, many people within the organization, the years I've worked on, as I indicated, Mr. Pruitt,

05:13.788 --> 05:33.109
The people that worked with me directly, Joe Rohde, Vernon Pellett, Delbert Black, Jenny Kitching, who was the home economics leader, a lot of people that, you know, that I leaned on throughout the years that helped make it.

05:33.129 --> 05:36.432
But if I had to do it over again, I don't think I'd change too much.

05:36.693 --> 05:43.660
I mean, you know, I was resentful in terms of what happened to me as director, but I had a wonderful experience in the department.

05:44.045 --> 05:56.493
They immediately accepted me as a full-fledged member and to this day I'm still considered part of the family over there and enjoy my association with them and keep up with the, with the developments.

05:56.513 --> 06:00.703
You know, they made a wonderful turn with, you remember Herman Brown?

06:01.460 --> 06:12.181
He was the one that probably made the turn, but, you know, that department was about to go out of business teaching or training vocational agriculture teachers because that's almost being eliminated in their school.

06:12.582 --> 06:21.038
You know, they hit upon this agricultural development area and they've got about six, seven hundred students in that area now, which is a, you know, a generalized agriculture aimed at

06:21.018 --> 06:35.137
providing leadership, you know, they get employment opportunities in agribusiness groups, you know, commodity groups and companies and so forth because they have a general education and they get, you know, enough some of the other things.

06:35.157 --> 06:37.480
So that department has really turned itself around.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.245
I can't take any credit for it, but I've been there while it's happened.

06:42.767 --> 06:43.348
I've enjoyed this.

06:43.589 --> 06:44.009
Thank you.

06:44.390 --> 06:44.810
Thank you.

06:45.551 --> 06:46.553
Let's quit there.

06:46.773 --> 06:46.873
Okay.
