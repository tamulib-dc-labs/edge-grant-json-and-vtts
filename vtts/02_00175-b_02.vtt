WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:10.112
And to reach the end of Carl's tenure, the new 
building was being planned. And what they were

00:11.053 --> 00:17.399
doing with that new building was primarily to make 
an activity building out of it. They were going to

00:17.659 --> 00:20.201
give more space for program. And me and a few others 
convinced them to change and make it a

00:20.982 --> 00:30.831
professional building, which would include the 
activity. And that probably gave me some

00:31.368 --> 00:36.284
visibility in the department that I hadn't had 
before and also with Frank Hubert. So when the time

00:36.866 --> 00:41.822
came to name the department head, Frank came over 
and said, OK, I need a question to ask. Do you want to

00:41.842 --> 00:44.972
go outside or do you want to stay inside? the 
faculty decided they wanted to stay inside. Given

00:48.463 --> 00:51.790
that choice, faculty will always say that, or 
would then. It may not be true now. So he said, OK,

00:54.536 --> 00:59.146
then I'll take applicants, and we'll proceed. And 
Linus and I were the only two who applied. And Frank

01:04.848 --> 01:12.716
then set up a colloquium and each of us made a 
presentation. To the department? To the

01:13.957 --> 01:16.099
department and to the dean's staff. And that was 
kind of a unique thing. I'll never forget that day.

01:23.807 --> 01:26.429
And Linus did a nice job with it. But I believe by 
then Carl had already decided who, I mean, Dr.

01:27.230 --> 01:34.517
Hubert had already decided who he wanted. But I may 
be wrong about that entirely. What did you attempt

01:36.840 --> 01:40.626
to emphasize in your presentation? Well, the deal 
was we couldn't talk about, we couldn't campaign

01:40.646 --> 01:44.992
for the job. Yeah. You know, the idea you present 
something academic. And back then it was, I

01:48.578 --> 01:51.122
thought it was important for the kinesiology or 
the physical education side of the house to

01:51.659 --> 02:02.272
understand what health was all about because we 
were a pretty poor second cousin at that point. And

02:02.732 --> 02:07.598
so I spent my time primarily talking about what a 
health educator is and what he does and why. And I

02:10.101 --> 02:17.110
don't recall what Linus said because I was second 
and I didn't hear a word he said. because I was so

02:17.562 --> 02:20.347
focused on what I was thinking about. About how 
long was your presentation? Oh, about 30 minutes.

02:25.315 --> 02:26.838
And was Dean present? Dean was present. Let's see, 
was McCandless with him? No, he was already over in

02:32.581 --> 02:36.265
the provost's office then. Hubert was there, 
Limbacher was there, Brian Cole was there, and Don

02:37.045 --> 02:43.231
Clark. Those were the ones from the dean's office. 
When you concluded your presentation, how did you

02:45.474 --> 02:49.397
feel you had done? Pretty poorly. Hubert was the 
only one to ask any questions, and he took issue

02:53.081 --> 03:00.208
with something I had said, and I have forgotten for 
the life of me what it is. But it troubled me enough

03:00.678 --> 03:05.846
until I went home and wrote him a response and never 
sent it to him. But I still have it. How long did it

03:09.170 --> 03:11.634
take him to make the decision? About three days. 
And how did you learn what the decision was?

03:20.807 --> 03:21.549
Good question. I think Carl told me. I think he 
relayed it through Carl. I did get a letter later

03:26.842 --> 03:28.245
on. But there wasn't a phone call or come over 
tomorrow? No, I didn't go to him. No, I didn't. I

03:33.114 --> 03:35.318
found out the other way around. In fact, I think the 
provost's office actually wrote the letter. I'm

03:41.129 --> 03:42.632
not sure of that. 10 years ago, because I remember. 
So this is 79. That would be then among Hubert's,

03:46.716 --> 03:53.728
because he becomes, at about that time, he becomes 
the chancellor. That's right. He was an unusual

03:54.930 --> 03:57.715
person to work for. I liked him a lot. I was scared of 
him, but I liked him. I'd had two or three

04:04.330 --> 04:07.778
opportunities to spend the day with him. I think he 
arranged that on purpose. We went over to Laga

04:10.063 --> 04:17.540
Vista for a day meeting that we had over there, and 
he insisted that I ride with him. So I'm sure that he

04:17.560 --> 04:22.812
was trying to learn more about me.

04:25.171 --> 04:31.140
The thing I remember most about him was that you 
really had to have your guns loaded when you went to

04:25.171 --> 04:31.140
see it. Because he'd work you over if you didn't. He 
just would hem you up and cone you. And Carl had

04:38.131 --> 04:39.213
warned me about that. I guess I may have been more 
afraid of him than I should have been simply

04:39.253 --> 04:45.142
because Carl had led me down that road. But what I 
found was that if you really did your homework, you

04:45.683 --> 04:51.732
could convince him. And if you ever convinced him, 
you didn't have to worry about the rest of it. He

04:56.822 --> 05:00.366
would make the argument on up the line. And several 
nice things happened to us simply because I was

05:01.287 --> 05:07.375
ready for him those first few times. But you didn't 
go over there and try out ideas with him. You just

05:12.161 --> 05:17.889
couldn't do that because he would rip you if you 
didn't. I can't say that I was sorry when he became

05:18.490 --> 05:21.874
chancellor. because it did relax things a lot. But 
we lost a lot at the same time because he was a very

05:25.620 --> 05:29.143
influential.

05:31.626 --> 05:40.574
Influential is the right word, but he also was a 
very doggedly determined person to get things

05:31.626 --> 05:40.574
done. Back as department head, you described the 
staff that you inherited at the dean's level. I

05:52.010 --> 05:54.693
mean, the departmental level. Oh, the 
departmental level? Yeah. It was... Was there a

05:57.496 --> 05:59.318
key secretary? Oh, yeah. As you know, every 
department had one. Linda Stewart was

06:03.823 --> 06:05.765
outstanding. How long had she been there? She's 
been there one year longer than me, and I'm 29 years

06:07.287 --> 06:10.470
this year. She had, well, not a year longer. She's 
been at the university a year longer. She was hired

06:15.516 --> 06:17.798
about a month before I was hired. And of course, she 
just was outstanding. Interesting thing about

06:24.608 --> 06:39.812
it, as Carl was getting older, he was 65 when he 
retired, and his memory was slipping, and Linda

06:24.608 --> 06:39.812
would use that because if she wanted to get 
something through, she'd say, you remember we

06:24.608 --> 06:39.812
talked about this the other day? And he'd go, oh 
yeah, I remember that. Well, when I came on, I was

06:42.155 --> 06:45.220
probably at the, top of my game at that point, and 
she expressed many times she didn't like the fact

06:45.622 --> 06:55.058
that I was remembering things, but now I 
understand exactly what Carl was going through. I

06:55.078 --> 06:59.385
can be tricked very easily. Who else at the 
departmental level was there in the office? At the

07:03.852 --> 07:10.583
time, we had a pool of secretaries in the front, and 
there was three of those girls, and then The

07:10.883 --> 07:12.786
activity program had one or two. And then Linda was 
my secretary. Not long after becoming department

07:16.832 --> 07:23.301
head, I convinced Dean Hubert to let me name an 
assistant department head. And that helped an

07:23.321 --> 07:24.703
awful lot. Les Palmer was the person I chose for 
that. What was the task of the assistant

07:27.968 --> 07:30.692
department head? Primarily, he was the student 
academic advising person. Back then, faculty

07:34.998 --> 07:39.304
advised students academically routinely. And he 
helped faculty with those kinds of issues. And

07:43.909 --> 07:50.818
also was the first line of visiting with students 
when they came in, undergraduate students. As you

07:51.379 --> 07:58.028
think back, was that a good plan to have an academic 
advisor at the departmental level, a student

07:51.379 --> 07:58.028
advisor? I think it was a good idea for faculty to 
advise students. And I may have misled you. I

08:05.958 --> 08:07.941
didn't mean that Les took over that job. He 
coordinated the faculty. I did think so because

08:11.263 --> 08:24.216
you needed someone to be the George Coonsey of that 
group of people because faculty were not real good

08:11.263 --> 08:24.216
at staying abreast of things that shouldn't be 
staying abreast of. But I really thought we lost

08:24.816 --> 08:30.622
something when we went away from faculty advising 
students. Now we have staff doing that. And what

08:34.166 --> 08:35.667
happens is that faculty build curriculum and we do 
all this argument and finally get consensus on

08:35.883 --> 08:50.650
what the curriculum is and then the academic 
advisor steers the student around the curriculum

08:35.883 --> 08:50.650
because their constituents are the students 
primarily, not the curriculum. Like in the

08:50.670 --> 08:57.462
history department, Vic Treat, a long-time 
faculty member, when he retired they replaced him

08:50.670 --> 08:57.462
with a half-time TA. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, what 
does that TA know about advising? That's right.

09:02.117 --> 09:03.619
Undergrounders, no experience at all. Did you 
inherit any particular problems when you became

09:04.139 --> 09:08.123
department head? I inherited a swimming pool that 
I wish I could have filled up with concrete and made

09:08.143 --> 09:13.629
a roller skate rink or something out of it. This was 
the old outdoor pool. This was the old outdoor

09:14.810 --> 09:17.213
pool, and it had lots of problems. It was like the 
old joke, you know what a boat is? It's a hole in the

09:20.276 --> 09:21.798
water where you throw money. That's what this was 
for us. It was a hole where we put a lot of money.

09:27.824 --> 09:34.195
Personnel,

09:27.824 --> 09:34.195
there were some problems. There always is. I 
called one faculty that was having difficulty

09:35.618 --> 09:45.035
coming to work and staying at work, and he tried me 
on because I was new. And I'm sure I didn't handle it

09:45.075 --> 09:52.228
as well as Carl would have, but we got it handled. 
Now, by that time, who were some of the good, solid

09:52.580 --> 09:57.409
old-timers that had retired? Penberthy? 
Penberthy was retired. Actually, I came in at a

10:00.775 --> 10:02.578
unique time. Penberthy retired, and we didn't 
have another retirement until Carl Landis. And

10:07.567 --> 10:10.993
when he retired, he was the only retirement we had. 
for another five, six, seven years. So it was kind

10:14.095 --> 10:17.080
of a stable group. And even though we had some old 
tried and true guys there, they were still a while

10:17.100 --> 10:23.170
off in retirement. And the program at that point 
was healthy in number of majors and courses and so

10:23.190 --> 10:33.146
forth. Good solid, solid cadre of students. 
You're never satisfied with curriculum,

10:36.674 --> 10:42.682
obviously, and we still had some work to do there. 
We began, as I look back, we began moving in the

10:45.006 --> 10:57.383
direction in physical education that we are now in 
that we're now more exercise physiology than we

10:45.006 --> 10:57.383
are physical education. My goal when I was 
department head, I thought that the centerpiece

10:57.683 --> 11:07.555
of the program should be the teacher education 
program. We were a college of education and that's

11:08.115 --> 11:10.618
what we ought to do. And that exercise physiology 
ought to be a resource for those teachers.

11:16.766 --> 11:19.329
Biomechanics should be, motor learning should 
be. But you put two people together and suddenly

11:20.290 --> 11:27.218
they shake hands and become a specialty and then 
the world evolves around them. And in exercise

11:27.468 --> 11:31.013
physiology, they were the brightest people we 
had. They were well-prepared. Many of them had

11:34.177 --> 11:38.042
degrees in physiology instead of physical 
education. And what's happened is that those

11:38.062 --> 11:43.009
folks have actually become the department. I 
don't know where that's going. I hate to be an old,

11:46.213 --> 11:53.964
retired person who says the world is dissipating 
because I'm leaving. It's not because I'm

11:54.164 --> 11:56.707
leaving, but I don't know where it's going. I 
really don't. Did any senior person like Carl

11:57.539 --> 12:04.562
Landis or Frank Huard, anyone else give you any 
advice as you became the department head? Carl

12:05.470 --> 12:10.058
gave me a lot of advice, which I can't remember any 
particular things. He told me where to sit in the

12:10.078 --> 12:12.361
dean's conference room. He said, I always like to 
sit at the end of the table, because I can look dean

12:12.381 --> 12:19.233
eyeball to eyeball. And that's what I did. I did 
everything. And it was useful, because I could

12:21.617 --> 12:25.703
tell facial expressions and body language. He 
told me a lot of other things. He worked me through

12:27.767 --> 12:31.613
one budget cycle, of course, and that helped an 
awful lot. This is going to sound self-serving to

12:31.593 --> 12:50.175
you, and I want you to know I've told a lot of people 
this, but you were dean of faculties that year, and

12:31.593 --> 12:50.175
you established administrator's orientation, 
and it was the first time I believe that had been

12:31.593 --> 12:50.175
done. And that was probably the single most 
important thing I did the first month of my job.

12:57.571 --> 12:58.733
First of all, I met some people. Bob Page is a good 
friend of mine still. He was Dean of Engineering

13:00.656 --> 13:02.179
that year. And I still have a good, close 
relationship with him. But I learned, I thought I

13:06.928 --> 13:09.953
knew how the university operated, But I learned 
things in that orientation that was

13:10.490 --> 13:14.635
unbelievable. And I learned contacts and names 
that served me for the whole time I was there. Now,

13:22.464 --> 13:23.585
that was my dream. And I can't help but observe now, 
with the enrollment being considerably larger

13:23.605 --> 13:33.937
than it was then, how much more valuable such an 
effort would be today. Sure. What were your goals

13:34.778 --> 13:37.881
when you took over? What did you hope? you were 
going to leave the department to accomplish?

13:42.022 --> 13:58.148
Yeah, I was hoping that we would build just the 
model I talked about, that we would develop a

13:42.022 --> 13:58.148
central program that all the specialties in our 
department would feed and build. And I saw that

13:59.050 --> 14:05.080
happening in physical education and I saw it 
happening in health education. For example, in

14:05.100 --> 14:05.961
health, One of the things that health educators 
need is a good background in epidemiology. Well,

14:13.175 --> 14:17.580
an epidemiologist is not a health educator, but 
you need that kind of person. And so as they build,

14:17.941 --> 14:21.405
you go to them for their resources. They didn't 
have to be in the department. They could be

14:22.707 --> 14:27.072
someplace in the campus.

14:27.305 --> 14:30.890
For their foundations and roots, they needed 
exercise, physiology, and those things. Then the

14:31.571 --> 14:41.044
second thing I'd hoped to accomplish was to build a 
research program that could hold its own with the

14:31.571 --> 14:41.044
rest of the university.

14:44.729 --> 14:52.920
A little while ago, you asked me had there been any 
relationships in the athletic department that

14:44.729 --> 14:52.920
was uncomfortable. I was thinking a little while 
ago, There was at least one that caused me lots of

14:56.161 --> 14:59.124
consternation. You recall that, well, you 
weren't here to recall, but you read through the

15:01.206 --> 15:05.109
papers, I'm sure. We hired Coach Sherrill to turn 
us around. And his first year or two, he was not very

15:08.552 --> 15:11.355
successful. And the Boo Birds were beginning to 
come out, as they want to do around here. But

15:16.320 --> 15:17.821
finally, he did get it going. And I don't remember. 
It was his third or fourth year. But he beat the

15:22.365 --> 15:25.408
University of Texas and won the Cotton Bowl. I 
believe we beat Auburn in the Cotton Bowl. And to

15:29.090 --> 15:32.913
reward him, the Board of Regents decided they 
wanted to give him tenure. And I got a call from then

15:34.134 --> 15:37.978
President Frank Vandenberg. And he says, 
Leonard, you know his deep voice and just really

15:39.419 --> 15:46.805
good one-on-one. And I was in the faculty senate at 
that time. I was deputy speaker. And I'd had some

15:51.609 --> 15:53.031
interaction with him. So we knew each other pretty 
well. And I liked the old goat. I mean, I better not

15:56.327 --> 15:58.190
say old goat, I guess. He's a character in the 
biggest sense of that word. I liked him a lot, and I

16:02.978 --> 16:04.460
think he liked me. But he said, Leonard, the Board 
of Regents wants to reward Coach Sherrill for his

16:05.041 --> 16:12.693
winning year, and they'd like to give him tenure. 
And of course, my first thought was give it to him in

16:12.753 --> 16:15.477
your department. And I thought, oh my, what am I 
going to do now? So I know I stumbled and I

16:21.975 --> 16:30.806
stuttered, but finally I said, you know, I just, I 
wouldn't think of doing this without consulting

16:21.975 --> 16:30.806
my faculty. This is a faculty appointment. This is 
a faculty decision. And I need some time. Oh, sure,

16:38.336 --> 16:39.838
sure, I understand that. Take it through your 
process. Well, that gave me some time to think

16:41.300 --> 16:43.403
about it a little bit. And I called my executive 
committee together and told him what was

16:45.055 --> 17:08.059
happening and I got some real good advice from them 
and some ways to approach it but they reaffirmed

16:45.055 --> 17:08.059
that there was no way that that should ever happen 
and if it did happen then that's just something we

16:45.055 --> 17:08.059
could not possibly stand for and so I called him 
back and the way I asked him was or it's probably

17:08.950 --> 17:12.875
politically correct, but I'm not sure it was the 
best way of doing it. I simply said that tenure and

17:13.476 --> 17:19.304
promotion was, again, a faculty decision. We put 
these young people who are faculty through a lot of

17:19.805 --> 17:26.694
hoops to go through the tenure and promotion 
process. Here's Coach Sherrill, doesn't even

17:28.257 --> 17:30.440
have a degree in our department. His degree is in 
business. And he certainly doesn't teach

17:32.282 --> 17:34.926
anything in our department. He's done none of the 
things that we that we require of our people to have

17:37.418 --> 17:41.364
to make tenure. And we just don't really want to do 
that. Now, let me assure you, Mr. President, that

17:46.030 --> 17:55.283
if in your wisdom, if you decree this, I don't think 
we're going to march on your office with banners

17:46.030 --> 17:55.283
and so forth. But I just cannot do it. Well, that's 
right, he said. I think that's a good thing. I may

18:01.392 --> 18:03.595
call the College of Business and talk with them. I 
knew he was never going to do that. But we dodged the

18:07.576 --> 18:13.964
bullet because a few days later, they did give him 
tenure. And I've forgotten the title of what his

18:14.966 --> 18:18.150
tenure was. Tenure of the university or tenure of 
something like that. But it was a made-up title and

18:22.115 --> 18:25.760
was meaningless, of course. And we dodged the 
bullet. So you never heard any more about it? I

18:31.007 --> 18:33.430
heard nothing more about it whatsoever. And I 
think, I really think President Vandiver was

18:33.747 --> 18:37.492
embarrassed to call me. I don't think he wanted to 
do that. It was something he just was being a good

18:39.214 --> 18:42.999
soldier at that point. But there was one other 
coach in the country that has tenure. The guy

18:47.084 --> 18:51.449
Paterno at Penn State has tenure, I think, in the 
English department. But he got that tenure about

18:51.469 --> 18:55.374
40 years ago. Other goals, go back to goals that you 
had as a department head. I think I probably

19:03.346 --> 19:06.552
exhausted that. Did you have some other schools 
out there that you wanted A&M to be ranked with in

19:08.154 --> 19:18.612
this field? I probably lack vision, but that 
bothers me a little bit. I think universities are

19:27.832 --> 19:34.401
making a mistake when they focus on being a top 10 
school. Not everybody can be the top 10. There's

19:37.365 --> 19:38.587
only 10 that can be there. And on what basis do you 
make that top 10? And do you sell your soul and your

19:43.614 --> 19:45.657
heart when you do that? And I'm really afraid that 
we have sold our heart to a large extent because we

19:46.718 --> 19:55.050
have faculty that don't care anything about 
students. They don't care anything about their

19:55.651 --> 19:57.433
classes. The only thing they care about is their 
discipline, and they don't care a lot about it in

19:57.717 --> 20:06.094
some cases, but it's their research projects 
because they know that's what's going to pay off.

20:06.755 --> 20:15.793
And I'm of the opinion, and again, I'm an old goat 
that's about to retire, and that probably says

20:06.755 --> 20:15.793
something about me, but I'm of the opinion that 
that the universities who are in the top 10 in the

20:16.111 --> 20:23.141
year 2020 are not going to look anything like the 
universities who are in the top 10 right now.

20:23.662 --> 20:29.350
Because someone's going to discover that there's 
a goal, there's a responsibility that

20:23.662 --> 20:29.350
universities have. And it's not to individual 
faculty members winning the Nobel Prize. And I

20:34.477 --> 20:38.823
think we ought to, I hope we have a lot of them who do 
that. But we're in the business of serving our

20:38.883 --> 20:43.249
constituents. How did you encourage that 
attitude in the department? It wasn't real hard to

20:48.852 --> 20:54.708
encourage because I think it was, in our 
department at that time, it was fairly common.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.639
There were several faculty who didn't agree with 
that. I really got blindsided in our department. I

21:02.711 --> 21:08.859
always thought that if we were going to be hurt, 
we'd be hurt from the outside. Someone

21:08.959 --> 21:12.303
criticizing us from the outside, and what 
happened was imploded. We've changed from the

21:12.864 --> 21:17.089
inside almost completely.

21:19.312 --> 21:23.277
I encouraged by simply preaching it and teaching 
it and trying to demonstrate it. But I really

21:23.678 --> 21:25.661
thought everyone felt that way. And it was right at 
the end of my tenure as department head when I

21:26.181 --> 21:31.668
realized that a cadre of folks weren't thinking 
that way at all. And I also realized that that

21:32.069 --> 21:38.557
thinking was out of step with the rest of the 
university and the rest of the universities. And

21:39.218 --> 21:41.301
that's when I knew it was time for me to step down. 
You were department head for how long? 13 years.

21:43.403 --> 21:47.849
From 79 to 80, whatever that is, 33. 13 to 90. 92, 93.

21:51.674 --> 21:56.380
What were your proudest moments during that time?

22:01.347 --> 22:05.493
I think recruiting the first minority was a proud 
moment.

22:08.958 --> 22:16.148
Our activity program was challenged in the 
faculty senate when we talked about the core

22:08.958 --> 22:16.148
curriculum and we were included as part of it. That 
was a proud moment.

22:22.775 --> 22:31.244
I was very pleased to be associated with the first 
chair in the College of Education, not only

22:22.775 --> 22:31.244
acquiring it, but in sitting in it. In fact, the 
first two chairs was associated in our

22:32.945 --> 22:35.788
department.

22:38.771 --> 22:48.141
I was, this is pretty small, but I was pleased with 
the way we handled the Jackie Sherrill tenure

22:38.771 --> 22:48.141
case, and I had a lot of help in that. I was pleased to 
be able to hold factions together. We had a very

22:55.035 --> 23:04.359
strong intramural program and we had a very strong 
exercise physiology program and a strong

22:55.035 --> 23:04.359
activity program and a strong professional 
program. I held those together. And they're

23:05.840 --> 23:11.493
beginning to unravel a little now. Now 
intramurals is over in student services. And I

23:13.678 --> 23:16.806
think that's a place for it to have been, for it to 
be. It operates just as well and maybe better

23:16.846 --> 23:19.071
there. But there are a lot of factions in our 
department now that I don't think existed then.

23:24.740 --> 23:30.906
Now, as department head, what did you think was the 
appropriate decision-making pattern for you?

23:30.966 --> 23:38.834
Were you the chairman bound by every majority 
vote, or were you to make the decisions without

23:30.966 --> 23:38.834
consulting with anybody, or what? Somewhere in 
the middle of that. I established what I called the

23:40.075 --> 23:50.285
DAC, the Department Advisory Committee, which 
included all the administrators, all the program

23:40.075 --> 23:50.285
leaders in the department. And we met biweekly. 
And I met opposite of where the college, the

23:52.803 --> 23:59.592
college met biweekly also, the college policy 
committee met biweekly also, and I met in opposite

23:52.803 --> 23:59.592
weeks. I thought that faculty ought to be a part of 
every decision. I always wanted to be a part of a

24:03.957 --> 24:05.559
decision. If I opted out, then I would opt out, and 
faculty should be allowed to do that. I also

24:10.346 --> 24:16.634
thought there were some things that faculty 
didn't want to make decisions about, and I should

24:10.346 --> 24:16.634
be willing to step forward. And I thought there 
were some things that were too important to be done

24:21.777 --> 24:25.902
by majority vote, but those were minimum. I'm not 
sure I was a good department head. I think it was a

24:30.789 --> 24:38.539
very enjoyable job for about six or seven years, a 
very difficult job for about four years. Now, was I

24:40.341 --> 24:44.626
doing a better job those first six or seven or a 
better job at the end? I suspect I was doing a better

24:45.868 --> 24:51.295
job at the end, but I was enjoying it more when it was 
early. And during those years, what was your

24:51.730 --> 24:56.446
routine? You got to the office about when and left 
about when? I was there by 8, sometimes 7.30 every

25:00.758 --> 25:03.501
morning. I hardly ever left before 7 in the 
evening. And the first seven or eight years, I

25:06.464 --> 25:10.688
handled that very well. The last four, that became 
really, really difficult. Not the time, not the

25:14.632 --> 25:19.777
time I was in the office, but it was just the phone. 
You've sat there, you understand. When the phone

25:21.539 --> 25:26.884
rings, you jump because you know there's hardly 
ever anything good on the other end of that line.

25:27.370 --> 25:35.870
Did any high-ranking board member, state 
politician, former student ever try to twist your

25:27.370 --> 25:35.870
arm during those years? I don't think I recall a 
single time. There was a period of time there where

25:41.785 --> 25:44.451
the board was inclined to want to pick up the phone 
and talk directly to faculty and talk directly to

25:44.768 --> 25:50.678
department heads. And I think it was during 
Vandiver's period of time where he requested that

25:51.419 --> 26:00.654
if that happened that we would notify the 
president's office immediately. I don't think I

26:01.395 --> 26:05.242
ever had occasion to do that.

26:08.046 --> 26:10.911
What did you do during those sometimes stressful 
days and nights, what did you do for relaxation? I

26:15.329 --> 26:21.337
stayed awake a lot, and I stomped my foot a lot. I 
didn't exercise as much as I should have during

26:21.758 --> 26:24.121
that time. I don't know the answer to that, you 
know, what you should do. I know I didn't handle it

26:28.847 --> 26:30.369
real well. You didn't play much golf. You didn't 
take many trips. I played some golf, and that's one

26:32.873 --> 26:36.798
thing I did do, but I didn't travel a lot. I traveled 
some. In the summertime, I got an opportunity

26:38.941 --> 26:43.547
to... All the department heads gathered in a 
national... I got involved in that organization

26:43.527 --> 26:47.351
and really enjoyed that. That was fun to get away. 
But I didn't handle that well enough because my

26:49.053 --> 26:59.303
last year as department head, I was diagnosed with 
heart disease and had to have a four-way bypass. I

26:59.924 --> 27:01.425
think stress had a lot to do with that. During those 
13 years, the number of degrees increased by

27:02.126 --> 27:09.113
about, did they double or? in the department. 
Degrees offered? No, no, the degrees received.

27:15.228 --> 27:16.131
Graduates. Oh, yeah. We doubled from... From 72 to 
84 we doubled, and then we leveled and stayed about

27:19.943 --> 27:28.495
the same after that. Now our service activity 
picked up a lot, not just activity courses, but

27:29.777 --> 27:36.226
service courses that we taught in the department. 
That picked up tremendously. About how many new

27:38.630 --> 27:42.535
faculty members did you recruit? Oh, in my time, 
Gosh, I'd have to think on that a little bit, but

27:46.066 --> 27:52.071
just a rough guess, 15 or 20. Oh, no, no, that's a 
tenure track faculty, hundreds of lecturers.

28:00.619 --> 28:01.560
Yeah, yeah. Now, who were those lecturers? What 
did they do? They taught the physical education

28:04.162 --> 28:06.244
activity courses. Many of them were also working 
on their doctorates at the same time, but a large

28:06.384 --> 28:16.073
number of them were professional teachers who 
were going to work in that program forever. That's

28:16.053 --> 28:16.794
what they did. Describe working with Dean 
Corrigan, who came at about the same time you

28:17.015 --> 28:21.862
became a department head. He was great. He was 
great. We had five candidates for that position,

28:24.627 --> 28:29.335
and he was my number four. I've told him this, and so 
it's not a secret. There was one guy I thought that

28:33.181 --> 28:36.947
was less suited for the job than him. The reason I 
thought that, in all honesty, I liked him a lot, but

28:37.096 --> 28:46.888
the reason I thought that was he was at the 
University of Maryland, and at Maryland, health

28:37.096 --> 28:46.888
and physical education are in separate units. 
They were not in the College of Education, and I

28:47.449 --> 28:52.235
just didn't think that he was going to understand 
what we were all about. I couldn't have been more

28:53.016 --> 28:54.458
wrong. There are a few things, errors that I made 
that was more wrong than that one. He came on board,

28:59.845 --> 29:02.648
and we then, Within six months of him taking that 
job, I suddenly realized one day sitting in his

29:03.134 --> 29:11.246
office that he knew more about my department than I 
did. And what I didn't know was he'd been, well, I

29:11.847 --> 29:15.732
did know this, but I didn't realize that he had 
programs before. His father-in-law was a

29:16.173 --> 29:20.239
basketball coach, so he knew sports. He'd been a 
dean at Vermont, and he had physical education at

29:20.279 --> 29:27.710
that point, so he knew a lot more about the field 
than I thought he did, but he also was a good

29:20.279 --> 29:27.710
student. The thing that probably impressed me the 
most, though, was that we would sit around the

29:30.185 --> 29:35.291
policy committee table, and he would bring a 
problem to the table. And we would start as

29:36.332 --> 29:40.517
department heads and associate deans and 
assistant deans to start talking about it. And I

29:41.418 --> 29:50.768
recall looking at him and thinking, he's not 
interested in this, because he'd be sitting with

29:41.418 --> 29:50.768
his hand on his cheek and leaning like this, and 
sometimes it looked like his eyes would have

29:41.418 --> 29:50.768
glazed over. And I recall one day looking at him and 
saying, he's about to go to sleep. But then, in a

29:55.261 --> 30:03.711
moment, he'd stop the conversation, and he'd say, 
okay, here's what I heard you say, bam, bam, bam,

29:55.261 --> 30:03.711
bam, and he'd lay it off in three or four points, and 
here's the action I think we all take on the basis of

29:55.261 --> 30:03.711
what he thinks. Most amazing group process person 
I've ever been associated with. And where Dr.

30:08.997 --> 30:23.935
Hubert was the kind of person you had to be careful 
with and have your guns loaded, you could actually

30:08.997 --> 30:23.935
explore ideas with the card, and you could walk in 
there and say, you know, I just had a thought, and

30:08.997 --> 30:23.935
feel very comfortable with that. maybe the best 
person I've worked for as a as an immediate

30:24.269 --> 30:27.994
supervisor. And did he have a sense of humor? Oh 
yeah funny funny guy funny guy and if you want to if

30:29.976 --> 30:39.428
if you want to ask him you know if you don't have much 
time to spend don't ask him a question because

30:29.976 --> 30:39.428
he'll talk with you as long as you'll you'll sit 
there. I was the chairman of that search and that's

30:40.309 --> 30:48.319
you were I'd forgotten that one of the things I 
remember is that he was a dyed in the wool uh

30:49.362 --> 30:57.125
football, baseball pro fan wondered could he 
adopt to the Astros and the Oilers. That was one of

30:57.145 --> 30:59.772
his concerns. Would he enjoy them? He was a neat 
guy. Under his leadership, did the department get

31:03.672 --> 31:07.138
fair treatment? Oh, we got very fair treatment and 
the college moved. I mean it really, now it didn't

31:10.764 --> 31:15.391
hurt to have a chancellor who was also from the 
College of Education. Even though that's not a

31:16.433 --> 31:22.423
direct mix, it was nice to know that he was there. We 
did a lot of good things. One thing he brought in was

31:24.486 --> 31:27.350
his centers of inquiry. And the idea was he wanted 
to cut across departmental lines. And here was an

31:33.640 --> 31:35.202
issue somebody was interested in. It doesn't 
matter if it was something in physical education

31:35.262 --> 31:39.929
or something in psychology. If everybody was 
interested in it, then they would gravitate to

31:40.050 --> 31:44.156
that center. A heck of a good idea, I thought.
