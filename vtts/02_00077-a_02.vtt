WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:05.977
hitchhike place south of Dallas. Well I'll take 
you. He had a driver. I don't know who it was but I

00:08.985 --> 00:17.044
kind of, I don't know what he did but it didn't 
sound, anyway.

00:18.408 --> 00:21.372
You just never knew, but it usually took about five 
hours. We'd leave about eight or nine in the

00:21.432 --> 00:28.840
morning, and we would be lucky to be back by noon, 
one o'clock, something. Did you ever have any bad

00:28.860 --> 00:32.805
Aggie hitchhiking experience? None. All right, 
you're giving the same answer everybody else has.

00:36.389 --> 00:45.360
You know, I even got a ride one night at 1 a.m. in 
Odessa, Texas, coming out here. A guy had just

00:47.973 --> 00:55.503
gotten married with his wife in a brand new car, 
gave two of us a ride at 1 a.m.

00:58.508 --> 01:00.130
Boy, that day is long gone. Isn't it? And see, 
today's students, they can't believe that, that

01:00.991 --> 01:07.220
you hitchhiked and it was safe. The only things I, 
and that's one of my standard questions about

01:07.921 --> 01:13.288
hitchhiking. Occasionally somebody will say the 
guy was drinking too much or was driving too fast.

01:19.616 --> 01:35.074
One guy, he was in a hurry to get to Houston because 
his wife or his girlfriend was playing around with

01:19.616 --> 01:35.074
somebody else and he was going down there to beat 
that guy up, but he let them out early. and nobody's

01:35.054 --> 01:41.463
ever mentioned any wreck or accident or nothing 
like that. All right, back to the daily routine.

01:44.106 --> 01:45.728
Class at 8 o'clock. What did you do between classes 
if you had an hour to spare without a class? It

01:52.918 --> 01:53.499
varied. A lot of guys would study. I never seemed to 
do that. I went to the MSC a lot, or I'd go back to the

01:57.304 --> 02:02.631
dorm room. took care of whatever. You had to get 
your laundry out and ready to go or you needed just

02:05.552 --> 02:17.300
your personal stuff, haircut, whatever. I didn't 
have very many hours off. When you're taking 20

02:19.745 --> 02:22.712
hours, you don't have many hours off. You

02:23.401 --> 02:29.648
marched to all three meals, and it was in Duncan? 
No. Or Sabeasa? Sabeasa your freshman year. And

02:32.791 --> 02:38.817
then when we moved to the new area, it was called, 
and then it was over at Duncan. In the MSC, where did

02:38.937 --> 02:41.380
you spend any time? Well, it was a little different 
than it is now. The original part up front is about

02:44.703 --> 02:53.172
the same, but as you were going what would be east, 
The post office was right in that front corner up

02:53.978 --> 02:56.702
there. And then you went down that long ramp and 
there was a snack bar, kind of a coffee shop. And

03:06.555 --> 03:13.826
none of the stuff that's in the back, all the 
bookstores and all that was there. And I used to go

03:14.026 --> 03:21.336
get something to eat, whatever treat, if I could 
afford to have something. as opposed to eating at

03:22.565 --> 03:24.027
Dunkin'. If you had an afternoon with a couple of 
hours free, what did you do with free time in the

03:25.068 --> 03:32.458
afternoon? I never remember.

03:39.146 --> 03:42.671
I remember having, you know, like the cut for the 
bonfire. I don't know how we didn't kill

03:42.691 --> 03:45.214
ourselves. Raining, slippery, carrying those 
logs out of there. And I remember I used to have to do

03:50.577 --> 03:56.843
it on Saturday and Sunday, I think it was, because I 
didn't have any free time. About how long did the

03:57.904 --> 04:00.287
bonfire work? I think we started in October, as I 
recall. Do you remember what direction from the

04:04.291 --> 04:06.493
campus? You know, I've often thought about that. 
Where were those trees we were cutting down? They

04:10.277 --> 04:14.121
put us on trucks and cars and took us out there. And 
you all were cutting them down? Well, I wasn't. but

04:19.433 --> 04:21.215
we were hauling them out. What were they using to 
cut them with then? Axes. Okay, that's what I

04:23.697 --> 04:25.679
thought. Do you remember anybody getting hurt? I 
never remember anybody getting hurt. Not to say

04:29.603 --> 04:30.644
they didn't. Usually there wasn't any. And 
Bonfire was then held on the drill field. It was in

04:36.990 --> 04:46.960
the drill field, and that was one of the big 
tragedies while I was there, was those two Aggie

04:36.990 --> 04:46.960
graduates who were Navy pilots that buzzed the 
bonfire and dove and the wings came off and they

04:47.497 --> 04:53.569
bore a hole right there on Welborn Road. Do you 
remember any pranks or anything? Somebody from

04:59.761 --> 05:06.293
Texas came over and tried to drop something on it 
one time, but we didn't have, you know, there was

04:59.761 --> 05:06.293
always rumors. They're on their way to burn the 
bonfire. All right, in the dining hall, any good

05:09.367 --> 05:12.090
bull there? Any pranks that you or anybody else 
tried in the dining hall? Oh, well, you know, we

05:15.815 --> 05:19.800
tried to always, of course, freshmen couldn't 
have dessert. We were always trying to steal it.

05:22.683 --> 05:23.985
Did y'all have cush questions? Yep. Do you 
remember any of them? No, I mean, I don't remember

05:26.788 --> 05:30.993
what they were. One that you can pass on is my 
favorite. How many stars are there in the Texas

05:34.277 --> 05:37.281
flag? One as far as I know. No, there's two. There's 
one on each side. And if you say two, you say, no,

05:43.699 --> 05:45.501
it's one. It goes through both ways. So there is no 
credit. Let's see. In class, how did you and your

05:51.727 --> 05:53.969
buddies behave? Oh, I think we were, everybody 
there was really very respectful, a lot more than

05:55.230 --> 06:02.756
even high school. In those days, high school was 
perfectly orderly. I think the people that were at

06:07.028 --> 06:14.598
A&M when I was there felt one, they were fortunate 
to be there, and two, they needed that degree. And

06:16.381 --> 06:18.664
we buckled down. We didn't. If you wanted to get 
away for an hour or something to kind of go and just

06:27.515 --> 06:31.659
be by yourself, not be interrupted, where would 
you have gone? Probably my dorm room. Maybe I was, I

06:33.601 --> 06:45.413
guess there were some guys down there that were 
taking the degree programs that didn't require

06:33.601 --> 06:45.413
the number of hours or whatever. And I know a lot of 
them went down to, there was some kind of quarry

06:45.633 --> 06:53.120
south of, they used to go down there and go 
swimming. I never had the opportunity to do that.

06:55.460 --> 06:59.965
Nobody yet remembers where it was, but they all 
remember going. It was somewhere south Wellborn

07:00.586 --> 07:05.351
Road, and then a little west toward the river. And 
they go down there in Skinny Dip. Nobody has

07:09.596 --> 07:13.240
described anything going on that was really bad. 
Yep, drink some beer, but nobody's ever talked

07:14.461 --> 07:19.947
about anything with a bunch of women or anything 
like that. You know, I never had, I never, ever, Had

07:25.497 --> 07:27.800
my wife come to A&M. I never had the money. I never 
went to a dance at A&M. Really? No. All right. Do you

07:34.108 --> 07:36.071
remember your freshman year? We had the cotton 
ball. It was a big dance. But wait. Let's go back to

07:39.756 --> 07:41.618
football season. There was a court trip to either 
Dallas or Fort Worth. We had my freshman year, and

07:44.262 --> 07:47.185
I've got pictures of that. We went to Fort Worth for 
the TCU game, and we went to Houston. Wait a minute.

07:57.290 --> 07:57.811
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, Houston. Either 
Houston or Austin. Well, I think it was Houston

08:00.195 --> 08:01.598
that year. Okay. And then the following year we 
went to Dallas and Austin. All right. When up there

08:06.526 --> 08:11.696
that freshman year, did you bring her down to the 
game? Well, there were so many Aggies dating so

08:11.816 --> 08:20.371
many Tessies that they had a bus that brought them 
all down right to the stadium. Mm-hmm. Now, who

08:21.775 --> 08:23.897
paid for that bus? She did. She did? And then did 
y'all go back to Dentonville? No, we spent, we were

08:30.003 --> 08:32.225
lucky. Her roommate was from Fort Worth. And we 
had, one of the guys in the outfit was from Fort

08:35.748 --> 08:42.414
Worth, obviously. We all, four or five of us stayed 
with him. And we did go out. I forget where we went

08:51.003 --> 08:53.788
that Saturday night. And then she went back and we 
went back. And do you remember any, on that court

09:01.280 --> 09:09.673
trip or any others, do you remember anything going 
on that really shouldn't have? Not that I know of.

09:12.538 --> 09:14.541
Pretty tame in those days by today's standards. 
Well, oh yeah. That's the only time she ever came to

09:17.260 --> 09:18.763
a court trip game. Even in Dallas, I don't think 
that would have been in my sophomore year for

09:19.324 --> 09:24.014
whatever reason. She wasn't there. And, you know, 
we just went up and marched, went to the game, and

09:25.978 --> 09:32.130
then I went back. Now, did you tell her about the 
Aggie tradition after Aggies score a touchdown?

09:38.956 --> 09:42.540
We still do that even on the TV games, right today.

09:45.564 --> 09:49.328
And our kids think we're crazy. And, all right, 
where did you spend the night? Did you have up

09:54.154 --> 09:55.435
there? Well, somebody in my freshman outfit was 
from Fort Worth, and we stayed at his house. And

10:01.380 --> 10:02.281
there would be dozens? Well, there were, I think, 
four or five of us there. Did you hitchhike up there

10:06.725 --> 10:08.807
and back, probably? Oh, yeah. Or somebody had a 
car. Very few people had cars, but I think a few of

10:11.969 --> 10:16.954
them did, and I think we got a ride up there. I 
remember going to Houston the first time. We went

10:19.456 --> 10:20.317
on the train. The Owl, or whatever it was called, 
went through there. We went on the train. How did,

10:24.676 --> 10:29.262
on a court trip, how did you feel as you were wearing 
that uniform? Oh, proud as a peacock. Why? I don't

10:32.045 --> 10:32.506
know. But I, by golly, we were different.

10:38.794 --> 10:44.942
As a person who did not go to A&M as an 
undergraduate, I think that's part of the

10:38.794 --> 10:44.942
building of the spirit. It is that being a part of 
the group. It is unbelievable. Oh, yes, yes. Was

10:51.273 --> 10:53.918
there a fish day in your time? I don't think there 
was. I don't remember that. Back in the earlier,

10:56.502 --> 11:03.213
before the war, there was a fish day where for one 
day the fish ran everything. Oh, yeah, that

11:03.413 --> 11:05.516
wasn't, no, that wasn't. All right, you came home 
Christmas. I came home Christmas, and in those

11:09.222 --> 11:14.190
days, of course, finals were not until after 
Christmas. I came home Christmas, and then right

11:15.368 --> 11:19.793
after New Year's we went back. You had a couple of 
days off at Thanksgiving, of course, but I stayed

11:21.535 --> 11:29.304
for the game and didn't come home. Wouldn't have 
anyway because I had no way to get home that short.

11:32.588 --> 11:42.760
And then you had Easter, which was about close to a 
week or four or five days, and I came home. My

11:43.077 --> 11:46.221
sophomore year for Easter, as I recall. I don't 
think I ever came home for Thanksgiving. During

11:48.264 --> 11:54.452
that first year or maybe two years, how did you and 
your family communicate? By letter. How often?

11:58.597 --> 12:01.141
About once a week. It was unheard of to make 
long-distance calls. And if you got a

12:05.727 --> 12:12.696
long-distance call, and I got one or two, they 
would call to the MSC. And then they'd send a runner

12:13.688 --> 12:20.436
over to your dorm, and you'd call back. And where 
was the telephone in your dorm? You know, there was

12:26.502 --> 12:29.386
one, but I don't know where it was. It was somewhere 
down at the end of the hallway, I think. No, they had

12:32.029 --> 12:33.550
it in the day room. Oh, okay. And I think that was 
true in all the dorms. I never got a call there. The

12:41.208 --> 12:43.876
two I got, I had to go to the MSC. Then at the end of 
your freshman year, what did you feel like when you

12:46.222 --> 12:51.897
went through final review? Oh, I thought, man, I 
made it. I made it. That's the greatest feeling in

12:54.756 --> 12:56.940
the world. I survived, and I'm better than all 
those people that quit. And were you then pleased,

13:02.509 --> 13:06.435
proud that you had not dropped out? That's right. I 
have accomplished something. You come home that

13:10.521 --> 13:11.483
summer? Mm-hmm. What did you do? I had worked the 
previous summer. I worked, I guess that summer I

13:18.921 --> 13:24.249
worked for Southern Union Gas as a draftsman here. 
And did you ever think about changing your major?

13:28.154 --> 13:29.416
No. And how did you, why did you pick that major in 
the first place? Well, as I said, my dad was with the

13:34.043 --> 13:36.667
General Electric Company. He had not had

13:41.827 --> 13:45.051
the ability and the privilege of going to college. 
And he said, of course, in those days, the General

13:45.111 --> 13:54.003
Electric Company revolved around electrical 
engineers. And that was the one thing, which is

13:55.325 --> 14:01.493
kind of irony, he said, you need to get a degree. I 
had decided I wanted to be an electrician. He said,

14:03.275 --> 14:06.840
you need to get a degree, and you need to go to work 
for the General Electric Company. They take care

14:06.860 --> 14:08.442
of you. So that's what you thought you were going to 
be, as a corporate engineer?

14:15.697 --> 14:16.698
I graduated in 55. I had to get a deferment. In those 
days, you had to go in, and I was scheduled to report

14:19.463 --> 14:25.251
to pre-flight, and I got a deferment. My wife was 
teaching school to get a master's degree. During

14:30.157 --> 14:44.764
graduate school, I said, you know, I'm not sure 
that I really like this big company corporate

14:30.157 --> 14:44.764
deal, and I wanted to kind of look around, but I 
never really got into it. And then all of a sudden,

14:46.427 --> 14:54.021
I've graduated with a master's degree, and GE had 
made me an offer the first time, They raised it, and

14:54.423 --> 14:58.047
my dad says, you need to take that. Of course, at 
that point, Rick, our oldest son,

14:58.308 --> 15:09.481
was born the night I got my degree, my master's 
degree. In fact, I had to ride in my cap and gown on a

15:11.203 --> 15:19.613
bicycle to graduation because I'd been banned 
from the campus. I had this old clunker of a car. And

15:25.220 --> 15:29.426
I used to sell TV antennas. I ran a little want ad in 
the Bryan Eagle. And to make a little extra money,

15:35.333 --> 15:39.860
in those days, there was a station in Waco and one in 
Houston. And you could put up a big 30, 40 foot

15:39.900 --> 15:45.066
telescopic mast and an antenna and a rotor. And I 
used to advertise and sell those installed. And I

15:49.793 --> 15:53.758
had this old car with a rack on top and carry that 
stuff. And, of course, I was out doing, trying to do

15:55.038 --> 16:00.205
that. And then I pull up and park in the faculty lot 
behind the EE building. And after I got about three

16:05.151 --> 16:13.702
tickets, why, you can't drive on campus anymore.

16:15.024 --> 16:18.548
Back to undergraduate days.

16:20.300 --> 16:27.450
the main facilities for you and all your buddies, 
there was the MSC. Did you encounter Wayne Stark?

16:29.973 --> 16:30.995
Did you get acquainted with him? What kind of guy 
was he? I don't, I mean, just as a student, great guy

16:32.337 --> 16:37.764
as far as I could tell. Superb. Yeah. Were you 
involved in any major extracurricular group? No,

16:43.334 --> 16:50.763
the only thing I was in, what is it, Phi Eta Sigma and 
Tau Beta Pi. And Ross volunteers, and I, you know,

16:51.764 --> 16:55.809
that was it. As far as you know, how did one become an 
RV? Did you? In those days, one day they called me

17:02.057 --> 17:09.426
over and

17:02.057 --> 17:09.426
it was the academic building. All those deals. I 
didn't know that much about the RVs, in fact. No,

17:14.424 --> 17:17.931
like you didn't go say, I want to be considered. You 
didn't submit an... No. They said, you've been

17:20.636 --> 17:21.939
selected. And as far as you know, people were 
selected on the basis of... I guess merit. I don't

17:28.391 --> 17:29.574
know how they were selected. And you were doing 
well also in your corps. Yeah, yeah. And in those

17:35.793 --> 17:40.322
days how many juniors were selected for Army? What 
were they? There were three companies, three

17:42.546 --> 17:53.166
companies and in each company four times about 40, 
there must have been about 120. So out of that,

17:56.407 --> 18:00.811
probably 60% of them were juniors.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.657
Do you have any idea whether there was any 
favoritism? I have no idea. I've never heard of

18:07.858 --> 18:09.820
anybody who thought there was. I don't know how we 
were selected. So if there was some secret

18:12.923 --> 18:17.427
backroom deal on it, I wasn't aware of it. Did you 
ever go to the Quack Shack? Were you ever sick? No,

18:20.369 --> 18:22.391
but it was right there across from Walton. They had 
that old old military 4x4 ambulance. I went over

18:27.140 --> 18:37.070
there one time and I had a sore throat and you know 
the stories about it were unbelievable and they

18:27.140 --> 18:37.070
had that old guy that was a doctor, remember that? 
But I never had to go there. I never really got sick

18:41.514 --> 18:43.315
of any of them under the cold. Alright, Guyon Hall. 
Oh yeah, used to go to Guyon. That was, I guess that

18:48.280 --> 18:50.322
was the only thing That and go downtown to the movie 
in downtown Bryan. When we were there for the Iowa

18:52.710 --> 18:55.834
State game, Marilyn and I drove downtown. Those 
theaters are kind of there, but they're not

18:56.936 --> 19:01.122
theaters anymore. In fact, old Tom Dollahyte and I 
would, one of us would scale the back wall up into

19:01.142 --> 19:14.740
the window in the back, slip in, go down, and open 
that back door for four or five of us to get in. And to

19:14.760 --> 19:15.722
go in? And it was only a dime to go, but we didn't have 
a dime. Now what kind of pranks did Aggies do during

19:19.428 --> 19:26.919
a guy in the movie? None while I was there. Oh, I 
thought you all yelled and hooted. Well, nothing.

19:36.393 --> 19:37.274
Not that I remember. Because sometimes in other 
years then they would make noise apparently and

19:37.315 --> 19:43.884
yell and shout. Along with the movie? Yeah, along 
with the movie. Did you go much to the campus

19:48.318 --> 19:49.939
theater? Over there, yeah. Yeah, in fact, my 
roommate, who didn't, he couldn't get a pass at

19:52.041 --> 20:18.105
physical, so he had to get transferred to tech 
after our sophomore year, George D. Sang, which

19:52.041 --> 20:18.105
the architect, Carol Doble, and George, our 
freshman year, that was their project to do, in

19:52.041 --> 20:18.105
architecture, to do one of these little models of a 
remodeling, and that George and I grew up together

20:18.878 --> 20:29.169
and I had the top bunk and he had the bottom bunk and 
he was working on that model and he just finished

20:18.878 --> 20:29.169
it. Uh oh. And he had it on the footlocker at the end 
of the bed. Uh oh. And I crawl up, my clothes in the

20:32.753 --> 20:42.304
top, take my shoes off, throw them over the end and 
right down through the model.

20:42.284 --> 20:54.763
Were there any, while you were there, any special 
groups or speakers or campus visitors you

20:42.284 --> 20:54.763
remember in either G. Raleigh or Guyon? Well, you 
got to realize that, let's see, G. Raleigh was

20:55.164 --> 21:00.732
built

21:06.112 --> 21:08.715
the basketball arena, G. Raleigh wasn't there. Is 
that right? Okay. I forgot. We had the old red brick

21:10.397 --> 21:12.579
building right there. What was that called?

21:16.364 --> 21:16.824
Oh, boy. You know where the bat is? Yeah, yeah. 
That's where we went to basketball. Okay. Were

21:20.308 --> 21:24.293
there any celebrity visitors, speakers, 
performers? Well,

21:25.014 --> 21:35.646
this was when I was in graduate school, I guess. I 
remember Marilyn and I went over to Guy and then,

21:35.879 --> 21:45.309
oh, one of the movie stars or something, a speaker. 
And the big bands were no longer coming to the- We

21:45.810 --> 21:50.915
had a couple of them my freshman year. They played, 
one of them played at the, I remember the Grove, for

21:51.055 --> 21:58.123
one of the, I think the Cotton Ball. But I didn't go.

22:03.436 --> 22:06.640
Religious activities on the campus. Did you 
attend any? The Episcopal Church there on South

22:09.583 --> 22:12.266
Gate is still there. Yeah, yeah. About how many 
students went over there, do you? Twenty,

22:16.911 --> 22:19.073
twenty-five, something like that. Do you 
remember Religious Emphasis Week in the spring?

22:22.778 --> 22:25.601
No. Okay. Here's an important question. Describe 
the student body in general.

22:32.309 --> 22:39.058
Well, I think the most important word is 
close-knit. I think the longer they were there, if

22:40.661 --> 22:54.881
you finished primarily that first semester, if 
you lasted until January, it almost became like a

22:40.661 --> 22:54.881
religion and like a family. What made it so? 
Because everybody endured the same thing. And

23:02.735 --> 23:16.589
I think while there was a lot of different 
backgrounds and there was a certain amount of

23:02.735 --> 23:16.589
spread, let's say, in the economic ladder, there 
wasn't all that much. There was a few kids there

23:16.609 --> 23:26.159
that had money, maybe from a couple of oil families 
or a lot of ranching families, but you'd never know

23:16.609 --> 23:26.159
it. They may have had a car. Everybody was pretty 
close-knit. I don't think that was true at other

23:32.491 --> 23:34.735
universities. I think you're right. 
Geographically, where were they from? Well, most

23:39.041 --> 23:42.065
of them, I'd say 90 percent of them were from Texas. 
Okay. But then within Texas, were there?

23:47.432 --> 23:51.958
Primarily from central, south, east Texas. There 
weren't that many from west Texas. Was there both

23:54.983 --> 23:58.948
town and country?

24:00.447 --> 24:05.474
Yes, obviously, but I can't tell you whether there 
was more rural when there were city or not. But I

24:05.494 --> 24:10.621
would say it would be pretty hard not to have a 
predominance of major metropolitan areas. I'm

24:10.721 --> 24:11.742
guessing, I don't know. And were there Catholic 
and Protestant and Jewish? A close friend of mine

24:16.128 --> 24:27.484
was Jewish, and his father was the merchant there 
in Junction, Texas, had the little clothing

24:16.128 --> 24:27.484
store. Didn't, I mean... But El Paso is that way. 
We've got a diverse community and nobody even

24:30.516 --> 24:33.318
thinks about that. That's right. Did it matter? 
No. Why didn't it? I don't know. It didn't matter

24:41.186 --> 24:43.728
here to me so it didn't matter to me down there. I 
think it's because everybody went through the

24:45.070 --> 24:47.072
same experience. That's right. In that era did 
almost everybody have a nickname or was it

24:48.293 --> 24:54.058
beginning to pass? I don't remember too many of 
them having nicknames. In fact, I had a nickname

24:58.919 --> 25:07.010
and got rid of it down

24:58.919 --> 25:07.010
there. Alright, let's go back to athletics. 
Describe the routine for an Aggie on a home

25:10.354 --> 25:16.302
football weekend. That was a great experience.

25:20.627 --> 25:26.395
The weekend started when?

25:27.286 --> 25:29.148
We had yell practice. Where? At the Grove. I was 
there the night Bear Bryant got off the train. Oh,

25:35.296 --> 25:36.417
describe that. That is one of my biggest 
experiences at A&M. It was like March or April, as I

25:42.464 --> 25:50.053
recall, which was late. And I remember we all went 
to the Grove. I was there when Ray George. When I got

25:56.003 --> 26:01.049
there, Ray George had come from Southern Cal or 
UCLA and didn't do very well. And here comes Bear

26:02.411 --> 26:04.113
Bryant. And I basically knew about his Kentucky 
deal, but not that much. But we were all excited.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.562
And we all go to the Grove. I remember it was at night 
and in the evening. And he comes across, as I

26:16.426 --> 26:25.699
recall, from, at least I thought he did, maybe he'd 
been there earlier, but he came across from the

26:16.426 --> 26:25.699
little depot over there. And he got up on that stage 
at the Grove, and he takes off his coat, and he takes

26:26.941 --> 26:36.715
off his tie, and he rolls up his sleeves, and he got 
up there and told us how it was going to be. And I

26:38.958 --> 26:40.881
thought that was the greatest thing I ever saw.

26:44.270 --> 27:12.522
and everybody responded oh yeah very very just 
went crazy uh and uh then that well we'd have yell

26:44.270 --> 27:12.522
practice and that you know well number one in those 
days we all had to make these uh signs on it was like

26:44.270 --> 27:12.522
big uh

26:44.270 --> 27:12.522
well there were like 10 by 20 sheets of lightweight 
canvas kind of stuff.

27:20.011 --> 27:25.077
And we would have to start making the sign 
immediately for the following week's game. It was

27:25.297 --> 27:27.900
some kind of cartoon. And I don't know how long they 
did that. And it, you know, in some way degrade the

27:30.663 --> 27:37.852
opponent and show Sarge or whatever. And those 
kind of cartoons, by the way, ran in all the major

27:43.568 --> 27:44.990
dailies in those days. They were famous for those 
cartoons. And we'd start making them. As soon as

27:50.778 --> 27:59.090
the game was over, we'd go back to the dorm and start 
making them. And in theory, we were supposed to

27:59.590 --> 28:01.713
have them finished that night. We'd take the old 
one down and you'd hang them from the very top of the

28:03.115 --> 28:10.766
building, get on the roof and hang it down. And But 
anyway, Yale practice.

28:18.825 --> 28:20.148
And it wasn't held at midnight? Oh, no. It was held 
on Thursday, right after

28:21.410 --> 28:32.012
the evening chow. Like, I don't know, 7, 7.30, 
something like that. Then Saturday morning, what

28:35.408 --> 28:40.975
time did the routine begin for home game? Well, 
usually in those days we played afternoon games. I

28:44.360 --> 28:46.763
guess they started at 1 o'clock. And the only thing 
I remember specifically was that of course we'd

28:48.966 --> 28:59.220
march into the game. But you had morning classes. 
all had Saturday morning classes, and couldn't

29:01.160 --> 29:06.226
wait to get out of those classes, going crazy over 
there. And if your young lady came to town, you met

29:07.967 --> 29:16.357
her before the game. Well, I never had that. Oh, 
that didn't happen? Okay. It didn't happen to me.

29:21.482 --> 29:25.767
So you marched in.

29:26.152 --> 29:27.374
First sergeant collected. You got those sheet of 
tickets when you registered. You paid for all your

29:31.960 --> 29:42.595
athletes, and they'd collect your ticket, and 
then as we marched in, there'd be a ticket taker

29:31.960 --> 29:42.595
right there at that main gate to take all the 
tickets. But, of course, they never counted them,

29:43.336 --> 29:53.070
and we always had a couple of friends from out of 
town in the middle of the ranks, you know, in some

29:43.336 --> 29:53.070
kind of uniform going in for free. And we'd go 
around the horseshoe and then go up in the stands.

29:59.194 --> 30:02.758
Now they come in two hours early, they leave, and 
then they come back. Now do you remember at any

30:03.378 --> 30:10.965
football game during your time any great 
celebrity general reviewing the Corps? Well, you

30:12.026 --> 30:16.690
know, I guess generals didn't impress me that 
much. I don't remember. I remember Alan Shivers

30:18.191 --> 30:20.033
being there. Okay. And I'm sure if I went back and 
looked at the annuals, there was some. Eisenhower

30:27.676 --> 30:33.162
was president, and he had been at A&M earlier, but I 
don't think he came during that era. I don't know of

30:34.083 --> 30:36.326
anybody. Then during the game, did you and your 
buddies, were there any pranks or jokes or

30:37.567 --> 30:44.656
anything you remember? No, we were just standing 
up and yelling. We all had to sit down on the

30:47.379 --> 30:53.466
horseshoe as freshmen, and then you moved further 
up toward the 50-yard line as you went. uh and then

30:53.935 --> 31:20.601
of course if we we won we went down there like they 
still do i guess get the the the l-eaters and and

30:53.935 --> 31:20.601
haul them off to prexy's pond do they still do that 
yes yes only the word prexy nobody uses anymore

30:53.935 --> 31:20.601
they don't no they don't know that they don't even 
know what that means you know the aggie land inn was

30:53.935 --> 31:20.601
there yeah yes uh wasn't still a comparatively 
nice place wasn't it I never went inside of it. The

31:23.948 --> 31:28.977
outside, you know, is kind of a Swiss chalet kind of 
thing. Yeah, I think important visitors still

31:28.997 --> 31:31.201
stay there. All right, then after the Aggies won a 
day game, if you and your buddies had a little extra

31:31.762 --> 31:41.760
money, what would you all have done on Saturday 
night? Go to the movie. Invariably went to the

31:43.743 --> 31:44.665
movie.
