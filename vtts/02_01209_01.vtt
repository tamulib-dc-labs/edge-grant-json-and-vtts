Testing one, two, three. Testing one, two, three. 
All right. Dr. Gage, would you please tell us a

00:07.540 --> 00:17.593
little about yourself, your early origins, and 
how you came to be a Texas Aggie? Well, I was born and

00:18.715 --> 00:26.365
reared in the hill country in a small town called 
San Saba. And no one from either side of my family

00:26.385 --> 00:31.371
had ever gone to college. When I was in junior high, 
I was on a 4-H judging team. And we came to 4-H

00:38.279 --> 00:42.344
Roundup and the state contest here. And that was my 
first exposure ever to a college or university

00:43.505 --> 00:48.291
campus. But it planted a seed very clearly in my 
mind. And I was always very inquisitive. had as a

00:59.633 --> 01:14.636
child gone out to a shed behind the house and played 
the mad scientist and had dreams of discovering

00:59.633 --> 01:14.636
something through research and 
experimentation. You had a chemistry set. I had a

01:17.060 --> 01:22.148
chemistry set and made my own chemistry set by Oh, 
different concoctions that I would mix up and try

01:22.988 --> 01:28.635
to poison red ants, quite honestly. Well, if you 
had found that, you really would have been a major

01:29.035 --> 01:32.860
inventor. I might have had a patent and been able to 
retire. And from then on, being reared on a small

01:36.784 --> 01:49.840
farm and ranch, had a very close tie to animals and 
to veterinary medicine. And decided that, and

01:50.748 --> 01:57.459
then through high school, that I wanted to study 
veterinary medicine. But I had always, since

01:58.501 --> 02:03.369
junior high, been in leadership positions. And 
through high school, and even held some state

02:04.270 --> 02:07.896
offices. So there was, from the very beginning, a 
real interest in my life always to take a

02:07.956 --> 02:16.350
leadership role. But I knew that college 
education was absolutely essential. And I worked

02:24.654 --> 02:40.293
my way through college with the help of my parents, 
starting first at Tarleton for one year, mainly

02:24.654 --> 02:40.293
due to the fact that I got a couple of scholarships 
that made a big impact and difference. And we were

02:40.654 --> 02:42.616
from a very poor family. And then the next year, I 
transferred to A&M. knowing that it was the only

02:47.414 --> 02:59.751
veterinary college and clearly where I wanted to 
go from the beginning and would have come here as a

02:47.414 --> 02:59.751
freshman had I been able to have additional 
scholarship help. I was one of the fortunate

02:59.771 --> 03:04.277
people who got into veterinary college in two 
years. Where? What year was that? That was in 1962

03:06.961 --> 03:12.949
was my first year on this campus. which would have 
been then my second year of pre-veterinary

03:13.638 --> 03:17.447
medical work. Then I entered veterinary college 
in the fall of 1963. We were in, or the veterinary

03:21.497 --> 03:29.537
college was on a three-year, year-round 
curriculum. So I could get a doctor of veterinary

03:30.462 --> 03:44.300
medicine degree in three years, but it meant going 
the total summer because it was really three

03:30.462 --> 03:44.300
semesters compacted into a total year schedule. 
And I recall that we had a couple of semesters in

03:45.421 --> 03:53.651
which we had 39 contact hours in class and 
laboratory per week. So it was rigorous. That's

03:55.153 --> 03:55.634
tough. But as I look back, I'm grateful for that 
opportunity because I was able to get an

03:59.048 --> 04:07.596
undergraduate and a doctor's degree in a total of 
only five years. Very good. And it added at least

04:08.597 --> 04:13.041
two years to my productive career. So I graduated 
in 1966

04:13.442 --> 04:27.435
with my doctor of veterinary medicine degree and 
that was in August because we were on that kind of a

04:13.442 --> 04:27.435
time schedule. And ten days later, I started a 
post-doctoral residency and graduate program in

04:28.225 --> 04:37.097
neurosurgery at Auburn University. Okay. And 
found myself also teaching veterinary students

04:38.399 --> 04:51.617
who were older than I because they had, in most 
cases, a four-year undergraduate, and then they

04:38.399 --> 04:51.617
were in their fourth year of veterinary college. 
How did you get into neurosurgery? That was brand

04:54.462 --> 04:55.664
new. It was brand new and was fortuitous for me 
because it was at the same time that a lot of the

04:55.985 --> 05:12.981
sophistication of human medicine was being 
applied to veterinary medicine and the public was

04:55.985 --> 05:12.981
willing and able to pay for it. And Auburn had a 
great reputation for their neurosurgery and had

05:13.433 --> 05:22.183
the premier small animal neurosurgeon in the 
nation. Did anyone here encourage you in that

05:22.364 --> 05:24.486
direction? I had encouragement from two surgeons 
here. And I had an opportunity to either go to

05:27.570 --> 05:30.813
Auburn or to Colorado State. And I had really 
become excited during veterinary college about

05:31.915 --> 05:40.605
surgery because it was kind of a challenge. There 
are no two cases alike. There's a lot of excitement

05:43.220 --> 05:44.822
in it. And I found that I also had good surgical 
skills. And when the opportunity then at Auburn

05:50.410 --> 06:09.197
presented itself, I left in 1966 and completed a 
master's in residency and became board certified

05:50.410 --> 06:09.197
as a diplomate of the American College of 
Veterinary Surgeons in neurosurgery. I

06:09.878 --> 06:10.539
taught... Which was probably a rare... Rare Beast 
at the time. It was and taught one quarter. They

06:18.265 --> 06:40.377
were on a quarter system at Auburn and then in March 
of 1969 I was given an opportunity to come back to

06:18.265 --> 06:40.377
Texas A&M as assistant professor and at the time 
they had no neurosurgeon and it was almost like

06:18.265 --> 06:40.377
handing me an opportunity on a platter to develop a 
complete specialty in that discipline. Now they

06:44.611 --> 06:49.460
had a neurologist and I had done a great deal of work 
also in neurophysiology. Who was the

06:49.480 --> 06:50.663
neurologist? Dr. Charles Hall, who is still on 
faculty. So he and I really formed a team and he

06:55.653 --> 07:02.567
handled the neurology cases and I did all the 
neurosurgery. And I was here from 74 to 82

07:02.986 --> 07:20.414
and was promoted to associate professor after 
only, I think, two years as assistant professor

07:02.986 --> 07:20.414
here. And during my tenure here in that position, I 
had the opportunity to really travel the world in

07:25.514 --> 07:35.048
presenting seminars and continuing education 
programs on the new techniques in surgery. I had

07:36.070 --> 07:40.055
the opportunity to do a lot of the pioneering work 
in neurosurgery. Who sponsored that? Was that

07:40.696 --> 07:45.123
through the U.S. government programs? No, a lot of 
it. would be through the professional

07:47.114 --> 07:51.258
associations. And the American Veterinary 
Medical Association, the American Animal

07:51.278 --> 08:01.848
Hospital Association, and then many other 
professional groups throughout the country. And

08:03.249 --> 08:13.459
the opportunities to present some of the new 
surgical techniques that we were performing in

08:03.249 --> 08:13.459
the dog Before I quit surgery and entered 
administration, I did over 1,500 spinal

08:14.165 --> 08:33.306
procedures, predominantly for slipped discs and 
broken backs, spinal fractures, in which the

08:14.165 --> 08:33.306
animal would be paraplegic. And unlike the human, 
where they're often placed in a wheelchair,

08:38.785 --> 08:43.230
that's not a viable option for an animal. I had a 
friend who had a dog like that. Well, if we could do

08:45.993 --> 08:48.276
them early, yeah. I got many of them to walk again, 
and that was so gratifying. I did a great deal of

08:53.962 --> 09:03.493
brain surgery in the dog for tumors, for 
fractures, and also birth. problem, congenital

09:04.250 --> 09:09.479
problem, called hydrocephalus, which is water on 
the brain. And I would use the same... Can you

09:10.301 --> 09:13.246
detect that at birth? Can you? And I would use the 
same system that's used in the human infant, which

09:14.769 --> 09:29.194
is to insert a tube into the chamber of the brain 
that collected the excess fluid, and it drains

09:14.769 --> 09:29.194
with a one-way pump down into the heart. And that 
was exciting to see the results. And then in 1974

09:40.463 --> 09:55.094
I was given an opportunity at a young age of only 32 
to become professor and head of the Department of

09:40.463 --> 09:55.094
Urban Practice in the new College of Veterinary 
Medicine at the University of Tennessee. And I

09:56.477 --> 10:00.345
will never forget, I got a call from a man named W.W. 
Armstead who had at one time been dean of vet med

10:00.595 --> 10:06.965
here. He had gone to Michigan State and he had 
called me at Michigan State and I was in surgery lab

10:07.465 --> 10:28.898
and they called me out of lab and I went down to my 
office and took the call and he said, I don't know

10:07.465 --> 10:28.898
whether you've heard but I'm going to become the 
dean of a new college of veterinary medicine that

10:07.465 --> 10:28.898
we're going to start at the University of 
Tennessee. And I'd like to know if you'd have

10:29.823 --> 10:38.896
interest in becoming head of the Department of 
Small Animal Medicine and Surgery, which we're

10:29.823 --> 10:38.896
going to call urban practice. Well, you know, at my 
young age, I thought I'd be delighted to talk to you

10:40.439 --> 10:50.213
about it because I still had that interest in 
academic administration. And even when I went

10:51.094 --> 10:53.518
through veterinary college, I looked up to Al 
Price who was the dean at the time and thought one

10:54.123 --> 10:59.869
day I'd like to do that. And my wife and I visited 
with him in Denver, Colorado at the American

11:02.112 --> 11:19.050
Veterinary Medical Association and then we flew 
up in August of that year and interviewed at UT

11:02.112 --> 11:19.050
Knoxville and during the time before we went I kept 
thinking well I wonder how many people are going to

11:19.638 --> 11:37.217
interview and you know they're probably going to 
look at full professors and people who have been

11:19.638 --> 11:37.217
out there a long time and lo and behold during the 
interview I was offered the job. Yeah I haven't, I

11:37.537 --> 11:42.943
don't know Armistead I don't believe but I have 
heard a lot about him and I have a feeling that's the

11:37.537 --> 11:42.943
way he works. He's a fantastic administrator. He 
knew what he was going to do before he did it. And he

11:47.067 --> 11:49.510
offered us the job on the spot. And I thought, well, 
we're not going to accept or he'll think I'm too

11:49.928 --> 11:55.875
eager. And we'll get home and think about it. You 
were really being nervy. So about two days later, I

12:00.500 --> 12:04.044
called him back. And we accepted. And I was the 
first person to join him after he went there as

12:05.706 --> 12:13.394
dean. And we went in November the 1st of 1974. And we 
were there eight years and built the complete

12:19.207 --> 12:24.392
program. I was responsible for that academic 
program and department. And then I was

12:30.738 --> 12:42.090
responsible for construction of all the 
facilities, which in today's funding level would

12:30.738 --> 12:42.090
be probably close to a $50 million project. Who was 
president of Tennessee at that time? It doesn't

12:46.454 --> 12:47.475
matter. Jack Williams had been there. Yeah, he was 
not there. Ed

12:50.989 --> 12:57.739
Bowling was president of the system. I can't 
recall. He was a historian, though. Yeah, that's

13:02.947 --> 13:04.229
what I was thinking, too. I guess vaguely in my 
mind, but I can't remember who it was. It seemed

13:06.212 --> 13:07.734
like his first name was Jack. I can't recall what 
his first name was. But it was a tremendous

13:12.380 --> 13:16.004
administrative experience for me. Were you back 
in surgery, too, at the same time? No, I pretty well

13:19.288 --> 13:32.945
gave up surgery to devote almost full time then to 
administration and to start a new program from

13:19.288 --> 13:32.945
ground zero and to hire every faculty member. I 
would say you did the hiring. That's exciting. To

13:34.707 --> 13:40.834
devise a brand new curriculum from scratch It was, 
for my age, just a unique experience. And to work

13:48.464 --> 14:01.000
with the state legislature, with the system, the 
university system, to work within the largest

13:48.464 --> 14:01.000
university of 30,000 student enrollment there, 
and to have that kind of a opportunity is really an

14:01.368 --> 14:05.134
administrative experience that few people ever 
have. Sure, that's right. And I have the greatest

14:06.516 --> 14:10.361
admiration for Armistead. He was a true statesman 
and one of the most astute administrators I have

14:11.603 --> 14:18.734
ever worked with and efficient. And then in 1982, I 
was contacted about the associate dean for

14:19.915 --> 14:29.890
academic and clinical programs here. And after 
eight years, I thrive on challenges, and I needed a

14:31.203 --> 14:38.094
new challenge. It was ready, and it was an 
advancement. So I took the position here. Was he

14:43.303 --> 14:44.465
coming back home, too? Did that have anything to do 
with it? Absolutely. My own alma mater and home.

14:49.533 --> 14:50.735
And who was Dean? George Shelton. Shelton, okay. 
Had you known him before? Not really. I had only

14:56.648 --> 15:01.237
known him by meeting at professional meetings on a 
national basis. And I had served as a consultant

15:02.921 --> 15:16.549
though here to the professional curricula 
revision because we had put a new curriculum in

15:02.921 --> 15:16.549
place which a lot of people were looking at at the 
time. So I did have an opportunity to come back

15:17.018 --> 15:27.350
periodically, and I think that that is one reason 
that they were looking at me very specifically. So

15:28.271 --> 15:32.016
what they did, they really combined two 
responsibilities. I had oversight for the

15:32.036 --> 15:42.148
veterinary teaching hospital as well as all of the 
academic and student programs in the college. In

15:42.635 --> 15:44.979
fact, now they have three associate deans. That's 
what happens, doesn't it? For the one position I

15:46.702 --> 15:48.304
had. Always happens that way. And I had great 
opportunities under George because he was such a

15:50.107 --> 16:01.065
delegating individual, and I had... a lot of 
wonderful growing opportunities in that role. I

16:04.645 --> 16:04.945
liked him. I got to know him somehow or other along 
the way. He was a true gentleman. In fact, I told him

16:08.010 --> 16:10.613
once he was too nice to be a dean. That's right. 
Probably so. And in that role, I really had some

16:14.780 --> 16:23.873
opportunities to serve on a large number of 
university-wide committees. And it gave me, I

16:25.215 --> 16:30.883
think, a growing opportunity for growth in my own 
capabilities and the contacts and the kinds of

16:31.370 --> 16:39.258
responsibilities on a university-wide basis. 
Yeah, because really at that time, I think the

16:39.419 --> 16:45.025
College of Veterinary Medicine was sort of 
isolated from the main university. It was, very

16:45.185 --> 16:45.825
much. And people on the campus really didn't think 
much about your participation. And I think that we

16:51.291 --> 17:01.242
really made strides to bring the college back into 
the mainstream, and particularly with the growth

16:51.291 --> 17:01.242
of the undergraduate program in the college. And 
then in 1989, I had conversation with Bill Mobley

17:02.437 --> 17:19.933
about a position in the president's office as 
chief of staff and executive assistant to the

17:02.437 --> 17:19.933
president. And after having served from 82 to 89, 
again, I was really looking toward upper

17:21.714 --> 17:32.224
administration, which was truly my long-term 
goal. Were you out of the classroom? Yes, totally.

17:39.668 --> 17:54.862
I would do guest lecturing and did some lectures on 
professional ethics, on stress and time

17:39.668 --> 17:54.862
management for the professional. And I would, on a 
few occasions, give some neurosurgery lectures

18:02.073 --> 18:07.259
on one or two subjects but very, very little. And so 
in 89 I moved to the president's office and of

18:09.501 --> 18:22.675
course that was a tremendous time of growth and 
expansion of my administrative horizons. I was in

18:23.937 --> 18:28.722
charge also of all state affairs and the 
legislative process. Now, I had done that in the

18:29.377 --> 18:37.466
veterinary college for each biennium because we 
had a separate line item budget. In fact, I had been

18:37.966 --> 18:45.334
a part of moving the veterinary college from 
formula to line item funding. So I had already

18:45.354 --> 18:52.802
worked through and knew what the legislative 
process was and the legislative appropriations

18:45.354 --> 18:52.802
process. So then I was in charge of it for the whole 
university when I became chief of staff. This was

18:57.536 --> 19:06.126
primarily your assignment with Dr. Mobley was to 
be the liaison and the anti-man in Austin. And to

19:06.747 --> 19:18.520
serve as the state affairs, and also to serve 
liaison to many of the external constituent

19:06.747 --> 19:18.520
groups, the former students, the Mothers Club, 
and many others. But he also gave me a large number

19:19.462 --> 19:28.370
of internal assignments, some of which were 
partly in the academic side. I had responsibility

19:29.711 --> 19:42.763
for the task force that made the recommendations 
in the international program office and the

19:29.711 --> 19:42.763
changes that we implemented there. And there were 
others like that.

19:47.930 --> 19:53.638
And that was for the full calendar year of 89 to 90. 
And then in January of 90, I was named interim

19:53.718 --> 20:00.408
provost and vice president. And then in July of 
that same year, I was named vice president for

20:00.468 --> 20:07.979
academic affairs and provost. And then the title 
was changed a year later to senior vice president

20:07.999 --> 20:16.131
and provost.

20:16.887 --> 20:41.762
Of course, that entailed a second administrative 
officer in the university and the chief academic

20:16.887 --> 20:41.762
officer with all of the academic programs, all ten 
colleges, the two library directors, all of the

20:16.887 --> 20:41.762
academic support areas, the research agenda, 
admissions and records all the way to placement.

20:42.903 --> 20:46.168
So these people reported to you first usually 
rather than straight to you? All of those reported

20:46.739 --> 20:53.878
to me before coming to the press. And then, of 
course, serving in that role, I served as acting

20:54.038 --> 21:01.177
president in his absence. And it was... great 
training for where I sit today because really

21:04.643 --> 21:30.366
there were no major surprises in coming to this 
office because I had spent a whole year in the

21:04.643 --> 21:30.366
president's office and then in that role so many of 
the agenda items were common and we always had a

21:04.643 --> 21:30.366
very close relationship and the president's 
executive staff discussed most all the issues

21:04.643 --> 21:30.366
that were before us. Did he have any unique 
administrative styles that be singular or

21:35.525 --> 22:02.511
anything I know I know he was really conscious of 
the technique and style of management that's

21:35.525 --> 22:02.511
obviously yeah yeah he uh his bag he uh is a very 
efficient administrator and uh a very open and

21:35.525 --> 22:02.511
good communicator with clear uh delegation and I 
had always told him in both of the tubes positions

22:03.335 --> 22:30.490
that I held with him that when I was given a 
responsibility I was just going to do the best that

22:03.335 --> 22:30.490
I could and what I thought was to be done and if there 
was something in it that I wasn't doing right or he

22:03.335 --> 22:30.490
wanted change let me know that I wasn't going to 
bother him and and that's the kind of freedom that

22:03.335 --> 22:30.490
we had and I think the freedom that we had also was 
built upon uh almost identical kinds of work

22:31.010 --> 22:49.136
styles because he and I are very close in work 
style, in delegation, and giving a person

22:31.010 --> 22:49.136
responsibility and holding them accountable and 
matching the authority with the responsibility.

22:49.437 --> 22:53.542
At this point, did you pretty well pull out of the 
Austin scene? Yes. Once I moved to the provost

22:54.043 --> 22:57.388
position, office i really pulled out of being the 
lead person in austin but in my role as senior vice

22:57.757 --> 23:23.292
president provost i still had a big involvement 
particularly in compiling the legislative

22:57.757 --> 23:23.292
appropriation request our office did that 
because most of the budget is from the academic

22:57.757 --> 23:23.292
side So in one sense, I didn't pull out, and I still 
had to testify in the hearings, but I wasn't having

23:23.643 --> 23:33.577
to be in Austin, walk in the halls of Austin. And 
that was then transferred to a person that he

23:34.458 --> 23:48.698
brought in after me, and that's Ellen Perrone, who 
was handling all of our state and federal affairs.

23:49.118 --> 23:52.603
Since, well, 89, 90 and so forth, when you moved 
into the... basically university

23:52.870 --> 23:54.793
administration. Have the problems, have the 
issues, have the concerns changed in that

23:55.655 --> 24:00.864
relatively short period? Or do you say, 
essentially, are we dealing with the same

24:00.884 --> 24:08.217
situations and problems you dealt with when you 
walked in the door in any lab or something? No, I

24:08.237 --> 24:12.364
think we're dealing with a number of changing 
issues. One has been the continued resource and

24:13.070 --> 24:24.485
funding constraints and very difficult economic 
situations. Right. Do you see that improving? I

24:27.970 --> 24:34.018
see it on the horizon of improving, hopefully 
within the next biennium or the one following it.

24:34.038 --> 24:34.839
Yeah, that's sort of what Dr. Mogul projected. I 
think that there are some positive indicators not

24:41.437 --> 24:55.796
only about the overall economy, but I think the 
realization that unless we make the investment in

24:41.437 --> 24:55.796
public and higher ed, that our future is limited as 
a competitive economy and society. And more and

24:56.678 --> 25:06.050
more do I see appreciation and a grasp of that 
importance by the state leadership and the

24:56.678 --> 25:06.050
general public of the state. It has not come 
easily. but it has come through our own efforts of

25:09.466 --> 25:14.993
educating the public as to that importance. 
Another issue is before us that will continue to be

25:16.435 --> 25:29.853
before us, and that is the demographic changes, 
the ethnic population changes of this state. It's

25:31.636 --> 25:32.857
a sensitive issue. It's one of considerable 
debate, has been, will continue to be, But it's one

25:39.115 --> 25:47.278
that we have got to recognize as a part of the 
demographic changes of this state. The state

25:47.298 --> 25:54.238
legislature has already begun in its makeup to be 
very reflective of the changing population. And

25:54.995 --> 26:03.266
if you look at the projections for the future, very 
clearly there will be no ethnic majority in the

25:54.995 --> 26:03.266
state. And we have as a state institution a great 
responsibility to educate all of the workforce of

26:04.187 --> 26:17.745
the population of the state for the future. If we 
don't, then we will continue to see the welfare

26:18.586 --> 26:37.130
roles increasing and the drain on the economy and 
continued needs for additional criminal justice

26:18.586 --> 26:37.130
increases in the prison system. And education is 
the basic deterrent and antidote to those. And

26:43.478 --> 26:47.023
we've just absolutely got to intervene and keep 
all of the

26:47.003 --> 26:58.584
ethnic groups of the population in the 
educational pipeline so that we do educate the

26:47.003 --> 26:58.584
workforce of tomorrow. Now when you say the 
educational pipeline, you're talking about the

26:58.604 --> 27:02.591
A&M educational pipeline. I'm talking about even 
public schools. We've got close ties now and

27:05.115 --> 27:11.627
intervention programs with the public schools. 
to try to keep these kids from dropping out in the

27:12.181 --> 27:25.386
seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth grade so that they 
at least graduate through high school, and then we

27:12.181 --> 27:25.386
hopefully will have them in junior college and 
universities then later. Do you think A&M has some

27:25.406 --> 27:29.093
sort of an advantage or disadvantage in... 
diversifying or making this kind of... I think we

27:32.926 --> 27:42.998
have a disadvantage for one reason as far as the 
enrollment numbers on this campus and that is that

27:32.926 --> 27:42.998
we do not have our location in a major metropolitan 
area. Where there is that diversity. Where there

27:48.324 --> 27:57.201
is that diversity and where there is already that 
pool of minorities living at home and who can

27:48.324 --> 27:57.201
attend. We have to recruit them to this location 
and for some groups it's even more difficult

28:03.920 --> 28:29.472
because it is a fairly long distance from home so 
that works to our disadvantage and we don't have

28:03.920 --> 28:29.472
the numbers within the community to build even a 
professional network and that impacts our

28:03.920 --> 28:29.472
ability to recruit faculty and staff and I do think 
that it causes us to have to work doubly hard. But

28:33.393 --> 28:35.735
we're making great gains. And we have the largest 
minority enrollment this year that we've ever

28:36.536 --> 28:40.540
had. We have a very substantial increase in 
Hispanic members. And we've made great gains in

28:46.366 --> 28:50.090
faculty again this year. And I am convinced that we 
have now begun to get that base overhead number

28:55.861 --> 29:00.367
that's needed. To build a pool to work from. To 
build a pool and to build a network that will help us

29:02.390 --> 29:05.734
in the future. But I think that's going to continue 
to be a big issue for this university and all of

29:06.676 --> 29:15.307
them, the universities in the state. I think 
funding is going to continue to be one. I think that

29:18.071 --> 29:23.438
the other whole area is that we've got to work on is 
the public relations area. There have been a

29:30.264 --> 29:45.713
number of adverse national media accounts of some 
improprieties at other institutions and

29:30.264 --> 29:45.713
research funding. of scientific misconduct,

29:46.334 --> 30:03.175
of perhaps not the right communication of faculty 
workloads, so that it's created the wrong

29:46.334 --> 30:03.175
impression. Has any of this been directed at A&M 
specifically? No, not at all. And that's where

30:08.101 --> 30:09.243
we're fortunate. We are. We have not had any of that 
directed at us. Stanford was the first with their

30:12.980 --> 30:18.307
problems in indirect cost. Harvard got into some 
difficulties in the scientific misconduct area

30:19.369 --> 30:25.677
and some publicity. And those... That's good that 
you're conscious of that because I think that's

30:27.339 --> 30:34.449
been something we've not been very conscious of. 
We've been very fortunate here.

30:39.956 --> 30:41.518
I think that... There is no doubt that our current 
endowment campaign and the continued efforts in

30:42.578 --> 31:02.933
looking toward external funding from the private 
sector is one of our most important priorities for

30:42.578 --> 31:02.933
the future. I think that we will no longer see the 
kind of state support that we had enjoyed prior to,

31:03.554 --> 31:12.287
say, 1985. And it behooves us to make sure that we 
continue to build public support. Well, that's

31:19.438 --> 31:21.782
one area we certainly have a leg up on. And we 
haven't, as all of higher ed, been very effective

31:28.647 --> 31:33.352
in communicating our value and our worth. 
Probably not, that's right. And we've had some

31:36.415 --> 31:58.317
lack of communication of what the faculty 
workload is and a lot of misperception that

31:36.415 --> 31:58.317
faculty only teach, you know, three hours and 
they're through rather than the number of

31:36.415 --> 31:58.317
sections, the number of contact hours, the number 
of hours in preparation. and the number of hours in

31:58.904 --> 32:02.669
grading papers and student counseling. We've not 
done a good job of communicating that. Do you think

32:06.154 --> 32:10.940
it's going to be more and more conflict over that 
kind of issue, which also involves the research?

32:11.281 --> 32:12.663
Absolutely. Absolutely. And do you see us moving 
more and more heavily into a research orientation

32:13.103 --> 32:19.772
and to a graduate level? Slowly, because we're a 
major research university and now being the

32:20.553 --> 32:27.122
eighth largest university and with... a very 
large graduate program, and with the

32:27.912 --> 32:48.113
commitment that we have made in Target 2000 to move 
toward 25% graduate professional enrollment, we

32:27.912 --> 32:48.113
will continue to slowly move in that direction. 
But at the same time, balancing what I do believe is

32:49.074 --> 32:55.641
our mandated responsibility as a land grant 
institution to maintain a very strong and large

32:56.009 --> 33:22.101
undergraduate program that infuses the cutting 
edge technology and the research that's being

32:56.009 --> 33:22.101
done into the classroom and continuing to not only 
take the top kids from the state, but at the same

32:56.009 --> 33:22.101
time in the land grant mission, taking still some 
broad spectrum of students from across the state.

33:27.649 --> 33:27.909
That's good. That's a good point. And that's key to 
us. I think in our striving for excellence

33:30.293 --> 33:36.641
sometimes we ignore the realities of the world. 
And I think that we've really done that recently

33:36.661 --> 33:49.860
with the new initiatives that fortunately I had 
the opportunity of leading in the undergraduate

33:36.661 --> 33:49.860
education programs. where we re-emphasized 
teaching. We revamped the Center for Teaching

33:56.313 --> 33:59.516
Excellence. We put the Center for Academic 
Enhancement in place, which is somewhat the other

34:00.016 --> 34:13.788
spectrum of the honors program in our National 
Merit Scholars to help the kids who are having

34:00.016 --> 34:13.788
trouble making the transition. So we're trying to 
look at both sides and both spectrums of the

34:13.868 --> 34:19.273
student capabilities. and about 15 new 
initiatives that we actually put in place to

34:19.658 --> 34:27.328
enhance undergraduate. That's actually been the 
great strength of A&M through the years. They've

34:29.611 --> 34:33.857
brought people in who had no other opportunities, 
and A&M gave them that opportunity. And I think the

34:33.877 --> 34:42.088
other thing that's helped us really

34:33.877 --> 34:42.088
be a leader in this area has been that commitment 
and that tradition historically. And the

34:48.239 --> 35:08.060
traditions of this campus, the support of the 
former students, and then the some 700 student

34:48.239 --> 35:08.060
organizations on campus that provide leadership 
and individual development opportunities

34:48.239 --> 35:08.060
because it creates a family atmosphere. That's a 
remarkable environment. I don't think any other

35:09.722 --> 35:11.704
campus has anything like that. And I'll tell you 
something that people fail to realize. We

35:15.671 --> 35:25.728
mentioned a moment ago that being in a small 
community probably worked against us on having a

35:15.671 --> 35:25.728
higher number of minorities. But at the same time, 
it works for us on the retention and... building

35:34.381 --> 35:44.037
the loyalty to the school because we're not in a 
major metropolitan area and we become the focus

35:34.381 --> 35:44.037
and we become a family. And when you capture that 
and combine it with the traditions, It is what

35:50.581 --> 36:00.358
really, I think, protects and promotes and 
enhances the Aggie spirit. Well, what's

36:01.179 --> 36:07.731
remarkable to me is that they've been able to 
preserve that aura in spite of the tremendous

36:01.179 --> 36:07.731
growth. Colas and Wires, in my mind, are two of the 
great inspirations for keeping that going. You

36:16.585 --> 36:21.330
know, the Corps of Cadets still being prominent 
and now growing again. We protect and preserve the

36:23.092 --> 36:32.203
traditions and the history of this university 
through those very clearly. The theme of this

36:32.703 --> 36:36.087
revision basically, of course, is change. And I 
noticed one of the things you mentioned when you

36:36.147 --> 36:45.478
stepped into this office was that you were 
interested in changing or adapting our students

36:36.147 --> 36:45.478
to the new global environment, so how do you see 
A&M's mission in the global economy? I think that

36:52.621 --> 37:10.605
we've really got some exciting programs and if you 
look at the number of our students involved in

36:52.621 --> 37:10.605
international study abroad experiences and 
student exchanges and the number of courses that

36:52.621 --> 37:10.605
we have on campus, We lead the state, and our goal 
and priority has been to infuse the international

37:10.822 --> 37:22.294
dimension into all of our academic and student 
programs. And that's done through new courses

37:22.915 --> 37:26.578
that have been developed. It's done through study 
abroad experiences. It's done through our

37:29.121 --> 37:35.468
campuses in Japan and Italy and now Mexico City. 
It's also done... What's going to happen there,

37:37.330 --> 37:39.652
incidentally? In Mexico City? Yeah. It will 
provide us an opportunity to continue to build

37:41.652 --> 37:52.554
partnerships and programmatic development 
opportunities with institutions in Mexico. A

37:53.356 --> 37:56.001
year-round office or a year-round academic 
program? It's a full year-round office, but we

37:56.021 --> 38:01.332
will not teach the courses out of that office. 
Except for executive development, business

38:01.312 --> 38:06.781
development kinds of courses. But it serves 
really as an office to bring partnerships

38:07.122 --> 38:13.934
together and agreements. We now have some 500

38:15.777 --> 38:22.629
research programs around the world. We have 100 
memorandum agreements. with other institutions

38:26.590 --> 38:29.775
across the whole world. And it's just a constant 
travel now back and forth of our faculty and

38:30.697 --> 38:37.127
foreign visitors to this campus. And with those 
interactions, our students are clearly brought

38:37.668 --> 38:52.032
into contact with the kinds of international 
dimension and the globalization that's

38:37.668 --> 38:52.032
occurring on almost a daily basis. It really is. 
And then with 2,800 foreign students on this

38:52.814 --> 39:01.629
campus, international students, they rub elbows 
with them every day. That makes a difference.

39:03.832 --> 39:04.814
Absolutely. In the environment and 
opportunities of the Aggies. And the recruiters

39:06.917 --> 39:17.134
are here on campus telling us that we must prepare 
our graduates to be able to function

39:06.917 --> 39:17.134
competitively. in the new global village. So 
therefore, that is a reason that we're in Jesus. I

39:22.410 --> 39:27.137
sense that my students in class are actually 
becoming a little more conscious of the world than

39:22.410 --> 39:27.137
they were not too long ago. It really is. Very 
clearly. Let me ask two more questions, I guess. I

39:31.363 --> 39:34.388
don't want to take up all your lunch date, I know. 
What is the enlarging Texas A&M University

39:35.449 --> 39:39.976
system? Is it a blessing or a burden? And then I 
guess finally would be your advices for whoever is

39:42.308 --> 39:48.658
in the president's chair. What needs to be done for 
the future? Well, I'm strongly supportive of the

39:52.024 --> 40:03.743
expansion that has occurred in the Texas A&M 
University system very clearly. this will be the

40:04.432 --> 40:27.672
flagship university within the system and should 
be and there needs to be a very clear understanding

40:04.432 --> 40:27.672
that it will serve in that priority role but in that 
role there is an enormous expectation that it

40:04.432 --> 40:27.672
serves as a leadership role and its leadership 
role should be to help collaboratively and in

40:28.259 --> 40:52.967
partnership with the other institutions in all of 
the academic research and extension programs and

40:28.259 --> 40:52.967
I think that it will serve as an opportunity for us 
to work in not only research but also in some of the

40:28.259 --> 40:52.967
academic programs with their needs of 
development and the needs of development,

40:53.605 --> 41:19.798
particularly in South Texas, and the expertise 
and consultation that we can give, I think that we

40:53.605 --> 41:19.798
can benefit by the fact that we should be able to 
recruit into our graduate programs students from

40:53.605 --> 41:19.798
their institution, and in turn perhaps even 
educate and prepare some of the faculty of the

40:53.605 --> 41:19.798
future.

41:20.234 --> 41:25.862
And that's what the system has always served, like 
yourself and Earl Rudder and so many others. No

41:25.882 --> 41:26.823
question.

41:33.052 --> 41:35.074
What was the second part about it? Well, it was a 
totally different question, I guess, and that is

41:35.295 --> 41:44.467
what advices would you give to a president of Texas 
A&M University? My advice to anyone who serves...

41:51.335 --> 41:57.604
in this role is to, first of all, be a good 
communicator. Now, the person has got to have

41:59.547 --> 42:18.355
the kinds of experience and track record in 
handling a very large, complex organization And

42:19.010 --> 42:28.581
the person has got to surround him or herself with 
the most competent people that they possibly can.

42:28.861 --> 42:31.023
It is too big for any one person. They must develop 
the team approach of people who are capable of

42:31.924 --> 42:39.212
handling the areas of assigned responsibility. 
The person has got to have a tremendous

42:41.055 --> 42:47.802
organizational and time management ability. and 
has got to have a tremendous amount of energy.

42:52.791 --> 42:56.457
Because some of these days are 15, 16 hour days. 
They've got to have a vision to see the big picture.

43:05.130 --> 43:16.827
They've got to know what

43:05.130 --> 43:16.827
academic and student and athletic programs mean 
to a university. They've also got to be very astute

43:18.089 --> 43:28.335
to the politics

43:18.089 --> 43:28.335
that are involved in dealing with many different 
external constituencies will have to be astute to

43:28.754 --> 43:48.497
the state legislature and elected officials and 
to build a trust and communication with these

43:28.754 --> 43:48.497
constituencies. No question. No question.

43:55.485 --> 43:56.787
And has I think got to make sure that they stay 
closely in communications with the faculty, the

43:58.201 --> 44:15.029
staff, and the students internally. Cannot 
become detached. Must know what's going on even

44:19.597 --> 44:24.445
though areas will be delegated. And I think has got 
to recognize that there are issues which have to be

44:25.133 --> 44:32.985
faced. And I've made this statement before that 
the easiest way to mishandle an issue is to ignore

44:34.327 --> 44:40.616
it. You have to hit them head on and try to come to a 
definitive

44:42.058 --> 44:53.976
resolution to each and every one of them. will have 
to develop a fairly thick skin. Yeah, I bet.

45:03.591 --> 45:07.295
Because you're going to get a lot of advice from 
many people. Inside and out. Inside and out.

45:13.421 --> 45:22.090
And to not only be a good communicator in the public 
forum or in the oral forum, but also in writing.

45:22.880 --> 45:23.981
Yeah. Because the letters and memoranda and other 
op-eds and pieces of information that go out,

45:24.001 --> 45:39.797
people are going to analyze and evaluate every 
word. Yeah, they do. You don't think about that. To

45:41.158 --> 45:42.920
see what the meaning might be behind it. That's 
right. And that gets into, I guess, the political

45:44.242 --> 45:52.650
sensitivity and astuteness of what is and is not 
said. That's part of it. You have to stop and think

45:54.762 --> 45:56.707
about everything you write. That's right. But 
it's an exciting opportunity. I love

46:02.904 --> 46:05.090
administration. It's a challenge and I like to 
take on the competition and play to win. And I get

46:09.539 --> 46:19.852
charged up in speaking before alumni groups or 
former students and to many of different public

46:09.539 --> 46:19.852
forums. Well, you've got an appreciative 
audience. They're really a good audience. And it

46:23.997 --> 46:25.839
really is exciting to do that. I would think this 
would be about as good a time to be a president of

46:26.320 --> 46:31.807
Texas A&M as any time we've had in the past. I really 
believe that because... It's fortunate that the

46:34.430 --> 46:38.315
direction, I think, is well set. Yes. And I don't 
think that it's a time in which the university was

46:39.636 --> 46:50.911
faced with major problems of needing to change 
directions, that we're on the upward movement. I

46:51.131 --> 46:52.032
sense that, too. In interviewing Vandenberg, 
yourself, Richardson, Mobley, and everyone I've

46:52.312 --> 47:00.382
talked to, there's a consensus there. And that's 
where I'm fortunate, because I've been a part of

47:01.464 --> 47:04.167
building... the plan of where we are and where 
we're going. Yeah, that's great. I better let you

47:09.133 --> 47:10.275
go, I guess. You've got another point. Well, I've 
enjoyed it. Well, I really appreciate it. Well,

47:14.924 --> 47:16.447
you're more than welcome. More than welcome.
