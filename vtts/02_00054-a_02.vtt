WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:11.931
And they would have old quizzes and a file that you could study or they would be willing to usually help you.

00:12.031 --> 00:21.503
And we had the CQ at night, which would last from, after we'd get back from evening chow, would last from like 7 to 10, the best I remember.

00:21.603 --> 00:24.286
And that was supposed to be a quiet time.

00:24.306 --> 00:26.168
We had to keep our doors open as fish.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.410
We couldn't close the doors.

00:28.371 --> 00:31.335
And they were still upper class getting you to do chores and stuff.

00:31.355 --> 00:32.316
But it was supposed to be.

00:32.718 --> 00:34.721
called the quarters and the quiet time.

00:34.761 --> 00:37.585
And a freshman couldn't, a fish couldn't have radio?

00:38.026 --> 00:45.297
No, oh no radio, nothing on the walls, just the basic books, no rugs, nothing extra, no curtains.

00:45.497 --> 00:55.372
Did other members of your outfit, sophomores and up, did they have record players and so forth making noise?

00:55.392 --> 00:57.756
A&M and the Corps has always been big on class.

00:59.058 --> 01:01.662
But you have to earn everything you get at A&M.

01:02.097 --> 01:14.042
Some of my people or people that I graduated from high school with went to Texas and the very first day they walked on Texas campus, down at Austin, they could do anything that the seniors could do.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.809
There was no, you know, they just could do anything.

01:18.571 --> 01:19.453
They didn't have to earn it.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.557
One of the beauties of A&M is

01:22.313 --> 01:26.717
preparing you for life, you have to earn what you get and I like that about A&M.

01:26.757 --> 01:34.505
Consequences for your actions and that was one of the basic principles that I learned at A&M that I've carried with me all my life.

01:34.565 --> 01:47.578
You have to work for it and so the class distinction, each time you moved up to a class you were able to have more things in your room, you had more free time, you had a better uniform, you had

01:48.757 --> 01:52.081
had just more privileges, they called it, class privileges.

01:52.321 --> 02:02.434
Do you remember anybody giving you advice on how to go about studying, how to go about where to sit in class or anything like that?

02:02.734 --> 02:07.601
Well, there were always hints of that about sitting up close like everybody gets.

02:07.921 --> 02:11.405
And I'm sure all 300 in that class were told the same thing.

02:11.425 --> 02:13.428
There weren't 300 seats on the front row.

02:14.629 --> 02:16.772
But that advice was given.

02:17.275 --> 02:21.703
They didn't have a course as far as I know like they do now about helping incoming students.

02:22.064 --> 02:32.142
The emphasis wasn't there at fish camps or anything like that to the degree that it is now about helping you make that adjustment and what to do with that area that I remember.

02:33.004 --> 02:40.397
What did you and your buddies assume were the unspoken guidelines about going to class and behavior in class?

02:41.221 --> 02:43.626
Well, we didn't miss class.

02:44.347 --> 02:46.792
We did not miss class.

02:46.812 --> 02:48.395
It wasn't even considered.

02:49.236 --> 02:57.472
And I won't say that we didn't sleep in class at times, because we did, but we were there.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.898
And we were expected to be there and just took it for granted.

03:00.918 --> 03:01.840
That's where it's supposed to be.

03:01.860 --> 03:03.904
That's what we're paying all this good money for.

03:04.660 --> 03:13.652
And so that was hardly a question at that time because so many of the exams in those days were taken a lot from lectures, more so than the book, it seemed like.

03:13.972 --> 03:19.680
And as far as you recall, were most of the people that taught your classes, were they full-time faculty members?

03:20.180 --> 03:21.362
As far as I knew, they were.

03:23.605 --> 03:23.785
Yes, sir.

03:23.805 --> 03:31.235
And as that first semester developed, what were, what was a tough course and a less tough course that you took?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.279
Well, the accounting was,

03:34.748 --> 03:36.410
It was hard on me.

03:36.551 --> 03:44.582
It just didn't make much seeing all that sense off of debits and credits and some of the things that they called debits seemed like ought to be a credit to me.

03:45.343 --> 03:52.814
And so I could just never quite get the hang of that and didn't stay around long enough to see if I could or not.

03:53.435 --> 03:57.862
But at that time I didn't appreciate history as much as I do now.

03:58.963 --> 04:02.308
English was always easy for me because we had a great high school.

04:03.284 --> 04:09.733
teachers and math was easy and those type courses.

04:10.914 --> 04:16.762
And you don't remember any of those first semester teachers by name, plus or minus?

04:17.323 --> 04:24.453
I don't, but you're one of them that I had sooner or later in history, I'm sure Dr. Monroe.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.537
I can't remember what semester it was though.

04:28.259 --> 04:33.308
You and me both were a lot younger then I think.

04:33.328 --> 04:35.332
That was about three years ago.

04:35.352 --> 04:36.835
What about nicknames?

04:36.915 --> 04:38.618
Did you and your buddies acquire nicknames?

04:38.658 --> 04:41.143
Just about everybody had a nickname back in those days.

04:41.163 --> 04:41.864
What was yours?

04:42.164 --> 04:44.108
Scooter.

04:44.375 --> 04:52.204
baseball days and I was playing shortstop and Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees was a shortstop that they called Scooter Rizzuto.

04:52.985 --> 04:56.329
And so mainly because of my baseball skills and scooping up.

04:56.709 --> 04:58.391
And that got translated down here.

04:58.411 --> 04:58.651
It did.

04:58.872 --> 05:00.373
It did and picked up.

05:01.715 --> 05:04.538
What about some of the other good ones in your outfit?

05:04.558 --> 05:10.064
Well, Vid Rabbit, we had a guy, Steve Reeves, a great ag that passed away a few years ago.

05:10.104 --> 05:11.866
They loved Texas A&M.

05:11.886 --> 05:13.268
Steve Lover,

05:13.501 --> 05:15.444
Reeves and we called him Red Rabbit.

05:15.464 --> 05:23.358
He had real big ears and he was red-headed and so almost every person did have a nickname.

05:23.899 --> 05:29.408
Do you remember any faculty members, teachers that you had that had nicknames?

05:29.889 --> 05:35.258
Well, there were several I remember and if I heard them, I would remember them.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.602
I don't remember them right off the top of my head.

05:38.189 --> 05:38.952
Tell you the truth.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.524
How soon did you... What was your... I didn't get one.

05:42.544 --> 05:42.764
You didn't?

05:42.785 --> 05:47.661
But those apparently weren't created in the 60s for faculty.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.768
It was the people that had been here longer

05:50.153 --> 05:53.859
Like Judge, somebody over in business was Judge something or other.

05:54.921 --> 06:01.892
And in English, Brooks Cofer, a local lawyer, his father, D.B.

06:01.932 --> 06:07.081
Cofer, when he wrote on the board, he would clean his hand on his coat.

06:07.762 --> 06:08.623
So D.B.

06:08.703 --> 06:12.069
Cofer became Dusty Butt Cofer.

06:12.089 --> 06:13.591
That's good.

06:13.611 --> 06:15.334
How soon was...

06:15.314 --> 06:21.523
How soon did you and your buddy Fish start any pranks or jokes?

06:21.904 --> 06:31.378
Well, being small, I was one of the, in my outfit, I was probably the first one called upon to pull pranks.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.384
And I'll never forget the first one.

06:35.464 --> 06:39.791
It was probably after we'd been there about three weeks, one night at Chow.

06:41.173 --> 06:44.798
I sat at the table in Duncan Metzall, 3,600 other cadets,

06:45.352 --> 06:54.041
one big open area fed family style and lined up in each table, had about eight, 10 people at each table.

06:54.141 --> 06:58.245
And I was at the table with my commanding officer, Don Thompson from Luling, Texas.

06:58.346 --> 07:01.889
And one night he says, Fishcocks.

07:02.530 --> 07:03.371
I said, yes, sir.

07:04.932 --> 07:10.598
He said, I want you to start carrying two feet of twine around with you everywhere you go from now on.

07:10.618 --> 07:12.220
I said, yes, sir.

07:12.419 --> 07:13.821
So that night, I went back in my room.

07:13.881 --> 07:15.864
I cut off exactly two feet of twine.

07:15.904 --> 07:21.873
I better measured it 50 times because I figured that was some of the test and didn't know what in the world he wanted it for or anything.

07:21.913 --> 07:23.375
But I put that twine in my pocket.

07:23.415 --> 07:28.623
I carried it with me everywhere I went for two weeks and he didn't say anything about it.

07:28.723 --> 07:32.629
Finally, one night, Charlie says, Fish Cox, yes, sir.

07:33.310 --> 07:34.853
You have that twine with you?

07:34.873 --> 07:35.473
Yes, sir.

07:35.714 --> 07:38.698
I thought I was going to get a reward or something for it, you know.

07:38.718 --> 07:41.903
And he says, I want you to go tie Mr. Dougherty's leg to the table.

07:42.693 --> 07:45.115
Well, Mr. Daugherty was one of his senior buddies.

07:45.696 --> 07:47.378
We called him Jungle Jim Daugherty.

07:47.478 --> 07:54.044
I never saw the guy smile, didn't have a conscience, and he was later went into the Marines and I think became a mercenary.

07:54.104 --> 07:55.666
I mean, that's the type of guy he was.

07:55.706 --> 07:58.609
He was, we were scared to death of him, Jungle Jim Daugherty.

07:58.629 --> 08:04.595
And so, this was the first time that any of us had been called upon to pull a prank on an upperclassman.

08:04.615 --> 08:10.000
So it was, I didn't know what in the world, you know, I didn't know they did this all the time.

08:11.127 --> 08:15.532
But anyway, so I scoot out from my table and get down on my all fours.

08:15.552 --> 08:24.341
And here I am, 18 years old, paying good money to come to Texas A&M, crawling down between these tables to about five rows up to where Doherty's table was.

08:24.461 --> 08:29.186
I went in at the end where my fish buddies were because I knew they wouldn't tell on me.

08:29.506 --> 08:36.334
So I crawled down to where he's sitting and I pulled that twine out of my pocket and I'm shaking like a leaf.

08:36.794 --> 08:39.497
And I finally get around his leg and around the chair

08:39.848 --> 08:43.915
And right before I tie it, all eight chairs moved back from the table.

08:44.756 --> 09:04.189
And I'm sitting under there like a rat on my all fours and Daugherty reaches under and grabs me by the collar and scoots me out on the floor, picks me up off the floor, holding me about six inches off the ground, about six inches from his nose, chewing me out up one side and down the other.

09:04.330 --> 09:05.772
I mean, I was...

09:06.072 --> 09:12.118
shaking, and again, being from New Boston, nobody ever talking to me like that.

09:12.138 --> 09:33.261
And in front of 3,600 people, they could see it, you know, it was pretty embarrassing for a little country boy, and I, so my commanding officer could tell, and he was about to get to me, and I was standing at attention, saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes sir, no, no, no, no, sir, I'll never do it again, sir, and going through this, and he called me back to my, back to the table, and as, as it would have it,

09:33.545 --> 09:43.434
we were having soup that night and I was sitting between two sophomores and I would dip down in that soup and I was shaking so bad, the soup was splashing out.

09:43.774 --> 09:45.876
All the sophomores, all their uniform.

09:46.376 --> 09:53.022
And so that was one of the longest nights of my career and the first prank that we had, any of us in our outfit had ever been asked to do.

09:53.042 --> 09:57.045
And so I kind of became known as the prankster.

09:57.105 --> 10:02.370
They were always asking me to do stuff and one of the biggest things was burning bibs.

10:02.907 --> 10:11.599
And that's where you would, the upperclassmen would have the bibs in their lap and the freshmen, the fish, had to have their bib tucked into their collar, their shirt.

10:11.719 --> 10:29.122
And so similar to the description a while ago, you would sneak down the alleyway, go in at the end of the table and go down and with the matches that you were required to carry around with you, strike a match and light the individual's bib that's, or napkin that's in his lap.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.604
And were these paper napkins?

10:30.624 --> 10:31.986
They were paper napkins and

10:32.388 --> 10:40.258
And by the time it would flare up, you could get away and back at your table, but they would jump up and look around trying to see who did it.

10:40.298 --> 10:48.187
They'd be beating out the fire and pouring water on it and all this, and I got to be kind of an expert at that.

10:48.207 --> 10:56.337
In fact, one time, and I'd never heard of this being done before or since, but one night I was burning an upperclassman's bib,

10:56.485 --> 11:03.975
Instead of running off, I just stayed under there because they never looked under there because you'd be stupid to stay under there.

11:03.995 --> 11:06.618
So I just stayed under there until it was all over.

11:06.718 --> 11:07.719
He sat back down.

11:08.320 --> 11:14.568
I took my napkin off of my neck, laid it in his lap real gently and burned his bib twice in one meal.

11:14.688 --> 11:18.093
So that's some of the kind of stuff that we used to pull.

11:18.153 --> 11:19.995
And there's several more in my book.

11:26.337 --> 11:34.010
some of the stuff you're asking about that kind of... What about, did y'all ever do anything to upperclassmen's food?

11:37.216 --> 11:38.999
I don't remember us doing that.

11:39.039 --> 11:45.770
Some of the outfits probably did, and different outfits were different, but I don't remember doing anything to their food.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.974
And we'd have deal fights in the mess hall,

11:48.578 --> 11:50.941
You know, just throwing the bread, the deal.

11:51.281 --> 11:56.046
We'd just sail it across the mess hall, get in a deal fight with another outfit or something.

11:56.086 --> 12:06.178
All right, that first semester, describe as much as you can the routine for your first football games.

12:06.839 --> 12:07.960
Describe what it was like.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.683
Okay, and can I back up just one second?

12:10.703 --> 12:12.705
Maybe this might be interesting about the mess hall.

12:12.725 --> 12:16.189
I'm sure some others have already told you, but there were four things that when

12:17.654 --> 12:18.856
to remember at that time.

12:19.577 --> 12:20.759
And I'll see if I can remember.

12:20.779 --> 12:38.146
I know when I was to run Hot Corner, you had to listen to all the announcements and you had to remember them and be able to repeat them all to anybody who might ask you and to give meal service to the upperclassmen.

12:38.166 --> 12:41.992
And the fourth thing is eat if you had time.

12:42.013 --> 12:44.877
So I've eaten on top of the table, under the table,

12:45.430 --> 12:49.575
Usually, if they found out you liked something in particular, you never got to eat it.

12:50.296 --> 12:59.166
We used to have what was called Boston Pie back then, and I called it New Boston Pie because that's where I was from, but I never got any because it was so good.

12:59.266 --> 13:05.493
And if they found out you didn't like something like spinach or liver, well, they would make sure that you had double portions of it.

13:06.054 --> 13:07.356
Now, you all had cush questions?

13:07.756 --> 13:08.176
Oh, yes.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.519
What were some of your favorite?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.783
Oh, well, one of them I remember that...

13:14.455 --> 13:21.565
they would ask you how many pounds of bird manure shoveled off Duncan Messall in 1939.

13:22.066 --> 13:31.400
And you know, you'd try, you had never heard, so you'd come up with something and say, well you stupid fish, it wasn't even built until 1941 or whatever the date was.

13:31.420 --> 13:39.552
So, but it was a lot of campusology questions and they were tough, but it made us Aggies.

13:39.852 --> 13:44.878
I wouldn't trade for that, that's some of the greatest times because it was our roots.

13:45.859 --> 14:01.997
And back then we were really big on trying to share about real stories about true Aggies and heroes and what it means and the heritage that we had as Aggies and I always took it seriously and remember that.

14:02.057 --> 14:06.642
During those first weeks and months, did you think about dropping out and going back?

14:06.662 --> 14:08.644
Oh yes, oh yes, many times I,

14:12.016 --> 14:18.765
And I would say, why didn't I go to that junior college in Texarkana like most of my buddies did?

14:19.265 --> 14:20.607
Did you talk to anybody about it?

14:21.348 --> 14:22.570
I never got to that point.

14:22.690 --> 14:23.691
I never got to that point.

14:27.216 --> 14:40.673
When it was really tough, and it was after they had started beating us and all, and I had ridden home, and I was telling my parents a little bit about what was going on, you know, and thought I'd get a little sympathy, and I did for my mom, but I'll never forget

14:41.142 --> 15:10.170
the first time my dad came down for a ball game and my parents came down and so they came over to the outfit and they were meeting some of the upperclassmen for the first time and Nick Walton was a senior from Beaumont that lives across from him and he's the one that used to beat me as much as anybody and so we were standing out in formation outside the dorm getting ready to go to the ball game and there was a little slack time there and parents were around and my dad went up to Nick Walton

15:16.478 --> 15:25.231
and I could see him and hear him and he was acting real serious and he got right up in his face and he said, what's this I hear about you whipping my boy?

15:26.313 --> 15:39.493
And Walton was, of course it caught him off guard and he was just kind of stuttering and stammering and my dad got his finger and poked it in his chest and he said, well I just want to tell you one thing, you're not whipping him enough.

15:40.915 --> 15:44.781
So from that day on I knew not to complain anymore about

15:45.149 --> 15:48.235
about the way I was being treated by the upperclassmen.

15:48.355 --> 15:51.461
During that first semester, about how often did you and your folks write?

15:52.843 --> 15:54.787
Well, my mom was good about writing.

15:55.348 --> 16:05.447
And I would say, as far as my responding back, probably not more than once every two weeks, maybe, or something of that nature.

16:05.467 --> 16:06.830
And we didn't call much.

16:06.850 --> 16:08.052
We had one phone in the door.

16:08.875 --> 16:10.818
One phone, we didn't have cell phones.

16:10.878 --> 16:14.363
Now they have two or three phones in every dorm room, it seems like.

16:14.383 --> 16:18.249
But one of the toughest things was being the whistle, I mean, the phone jock.

16:18.910 --> 16:20.773
There were four dorms, four floors.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.275
You know what I mean?

16:22.355 --> 16:26.601
Over 200 people we're talking about, or closer to 400 maybe.

16:27.022 --> 16:28.564
And where was your post office box?

16:29.085 --> 16:30.788
In MSC.

16:31.609 --> 16:34.674
In MSC is where mine was.

16:34.734 --> 16:38.359
The phone jock, you know, with one phone, whoever was closest to it,

16:38.508 --> 16:40.710
a fish was assigned to answer it.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.332
And it might be for somebody on the fourth floor.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.414
So they'd answer it, run upstairs.

16:44.434 --> 16:46.196
You had to meet everybody that you didn't know.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.579
Finally get to the person's room.

16:48.959 --> 16:49.680
They'd come down.

16:49.720 --> 16:55.046
By that time they'd hung up and you'd be in trouble for calling them up there or whatever.

16:55.126 --> 16:58.649
So it was just one of those differences.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.352
Alright, let's go back to football.

17:01.372 --> 17:01.813
Ball game.

17:01.873 --> 17:02.373
Ball game.

17:02.393 --> 17:02.554
Yeah.

17:03.034 --> 17:05.697
Just a great time.

17:06.892 --> 17:13.679
I can't even remember who we played the first, but one of the regular members I have, we didn't win a lot of ball games back in those days.

17:13.699 --> 17:35.363
We didn't outscore the other team, but it was the year that we were playing Tech, and we were ahead, and Tech scored with about a minute to go or less, and we went down, and all the fish were out on the, we were down on the field ahead of time to carry the yellow eaters off,

17:36.035 --> 17:39.641
and congratulate the team, and then Tech scores.

17:40.222 --> 17:53.643
We're still already down there, and lo and behold, they kick off to Hugh McElhenney, and I believe it was Hugh McElhenney, and he runs it all the way back for a touchdown, and we beat the Raiders.

17:53.663 --> 17:58.470
It was a great, exciting time, as you can imagine, especially for those of us that had played sports.

17:58.490 --> 18:00.253
It really was exciting.

18:00.419 --> 18:09.130
So standing up, everybody a little bit more disciplined back in those days as far as humping it.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.592
I mean everybody looked the same.

18:10.612 --> 18:12.995
You really, you just didn't barely lean over.

18:13.075 --> 18:17.060
You had your knees together and your head up and your back straight and you were really hollering.

18:17.821 --> 18:24.329
And I mean it was loud even though we had 8,000 less students and didn't have all the double decks and all that.

18:24.449 --> 18:28.975
It was a horseshoe and it'd be loud enough to stop ball games.

18:29.292 --> 18:38.705
Right, now that first year, though, you didn't have a date here very much, did you, for a game?

18:39.006 --> 18:41.469
No, not at all.

18:41.690 --> 18:45.135
Some of the upperclassmen did, and some of the guys from Houston did.

18:45.155 --> 18:49.821
And New Boston, I didn't know anybody here and didn't have a way to get around, so I didn't do.

18:49.941 --> 18:54.908
What kind of explanation did anybody give you all about Yale practice?

18:56.771 --> 18:57.392
Do you remember?

18:58.553 --> 19:01.878
I don't remember any explanation about it.

19:02.098 --> 19:05.423
I remember... And it was held in the stadium.

19:05.443 --> 19:05.903
It was.

19:06.244 --> 19:07.666
It was in the stadium.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.770
And a great time.

19:10.790 --> 19:12.593
Going over there and back is outfit.

19:12.613 --> 19:13.835
You would stay with your buddies.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.418
And coming back, you would have to stay in the streets.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.121
You couldn't be on the sidewalk.

19:18.181 --> 19:21.045
And of course, nobody could be on the grass except the seniors.

19:21.386 --> 19:24.670
Again, part of the privilege rank aspect of it.

19:26.012 --> 19:26.653
But that was...

19:27.005 --> 19:32.412
A time when a lot of the upperclassmen would haze you on the way back and give you a hard time.

19:32.532 --> 19:37.619
But then also a lot of them from other outfits would drop handles with you on the way back too.

19:37.739 --> 19:41.504
So you got to meet some upperclassmen from other outfits.

19:41.584 --> 19:50.556
During the game itself, since you didn't have a date, you and a bunch of your buddies were together, where did you all end up standing?

19:51.737 --> 19:56.083
Well we, of course again, privileged by class.

19:56.435 --> 20:14.619
The seniors were on the 50-yard line, juniors, you know, on down on the 40, the 30, and finally the fish, we were down at the very end on the goal line or the horseshoe area with the worst seats, of course, and, of course, the way it should be and the way I like it.

20:14.679 --> 20:17.823
Did y'all try any jokes, pranks, good bull during the games?

20:18.144 --> 20:21.628
No, no, no, not us, not at all.

20:22.169 --> 20:25.193
We were told to keep one eye on the game and one eye on the yellow here.

20:25.612 --> 20:31.482
And that's pretty much, there wasn't any kind of goofing around or trying to pull some of these other colleges.

20:31.502 --> 20:35.508
It'd be like another college and bouncing beach balls around in the stadiums.

20:35.528 --> 20:36.109
None of that.

20:36.129 --> 20:38.473
You did help carry Yelp Eaters to the?

20:39.054 --> 20:40.156
Fish pond, yes.

20:40.857 --> 20:52.716
Another thing about the Yelp practices that I really think they're missing out on today and I wish they had more of is that we'd have Yelp practice on Tuesday nights also, which was a little bit more informal.

20:53.236 --> 21:04.514
It was just the students there and that's where you really learned the yells and you had time to go over them and they'd talk to you about what it was really about and that was my favorite yell practice in all honesty.

21:04.554 --> 21:19.497
The midnight yell is the famous one, but the yell practice during the week is the one where we really got down to business and right after chow, we'd all march over, the yell leaders wouldn't even have on their whites, they'd have on their senior boots and roll up their sleeves.

21:20.219 --> 21:24.244
Did you and your buddies ever deliberately yell the wrong words?

21:24.644 --> 21:25.125
No.

21:25.145 --> 21:26.487
You always said the right thing.

21:26.507 --> 21:28.149
Yes, yeah.

21:28.469 --> 21:33.535
And some difference in the yells, a little bit in the way they emphasize some of the words.

21:33.595 --> 21:46.851
It was back in those days, the former spite, for example, it was more former spite, like an exclamation point, rather than former spite, like a question mark they do today, which I don't like.

21:47.168 --> 21:51.954
When the game was over, what did you and your buddies do on a Saturday night?

21:52.334 --> 21:57.721
Well now a lot of my buddies, my fish buddies, if they were from Houston, a lot of them were, they had days.

21:57.781 --> 22:08.934
They were close enough to come and they already had in high school sweethearts and all and a lot of them would go out and fish Jerry France and I didn't have a date.

22:08.994 --> 22:16.703
We'd sit there watching all of our buddies walk by the window, tears running down our eyes listening to Ray Charles or somebody singing some sad song

22:17.341 --> 22:27.271
And now I, you know, I know a lot of this went on, but I personally did not partake.

22:27.291 --> 22:32.236
I didn't drink or smoke and that kind of stuff because of my Christian background.

22:32.817 --> 22:33.758
But of course a lot did.

22:33.798 --> 22:39.124
And I would go to outfit parties where they would have alcohol but not participate.

22:39.144 --> 22:40.825
So I was pretty quick.

22:40.845 --> 22:41.726
Where were those held?

22:42.007 --> 22:44.569
You know, I can't tell you.

22:44.769 --> 22:45.390
I don't know.

22:45.573 --> 22:46.855
I really don't remember.

22:46.895 --> 22:48.296
I just remember I'd always go.

22:50.058 --> 22:52.041
But were they held in the pasture somewhere?

22:52.281 --> 22:57.187
No, they were at some lounge or something I guess most of the time it seems like.

22:57.247 --> 22:57.988
It was a building.

22:58.449 --> 23:00.732
Our outfit didn't have anything.

23:01.212 --> 23:03.735
Did you go on a court trip the first year?

23:03.895 --> 23:05.197
Yes, two court trips.

23:05.217 --> 23:09.302
Of course back in those days you'd either go to Austin, Fort Worth,

23:11.510 --> 23:15.076
and you'd go to two of those a year depending on which one was out of town.

23:15.136 --> 23:18.141
That was a great time and you had to get there whatever way you could.

23:18.361 --> 23:19.002
How'd you get there?

23:19.523 --> 23:24.350
Well, most of the time it was with buddies.

23:24.991 --> 23:28.597
I didn't have a car, but a few of my buddies did and ride with them.

23:28.617 --> 23:36.169
There was a lot of hitchhiking went on back in those days though and I would hitchhike on occasion too, especially going home.

23:36.269 --> 23:37.551
I would hitchhike all the time.

23:37.672 --> 23:38.513
Describe that.

23:39.016 --> 23:41.199
Well, it wasn't a scary time.

23:41.359 --> 23:49.630
I wouldn't hitchhike today, and I wouldn't recommend anybody do this, but back then it was just a different America and a different time.

23:49.690 --> 23:52.253
About how long did it take to get to New Boston?

23:52.273 --> 23:57.580
Well, normally if you were driving, it would take four and a half hours.

23:57.700 --> 23:58.461
But if you were hitchhiking?

23:58.521 --> 24:02.246
Now, if you're hitchhiking, it might take seven, something like that.

24:03.047 --> 24:04.609
What route did you normally follow?

24:04.869 --> 24:06.171
Well...

24:06.607 --> 24:20.046
the route that we were supposed to follow would be like to go to Buffalo, well to North Results, Jewett, Buffalo, Palestine, Tyler, Gilmer, Mount Pleasant, then New Boston.

24:21.008 --> 24:24.773
But one time I went through three states getting home.

24:25.314 --> 24:27.898
And that happened because we're in the four states area.

24:28.438 --> 24:33.846
And my first ride took me to Shreveport, which was Louisiana, which is just about 90 miles from New Boston.

24:34.248 --> 24:39.936
Then going from Shreveport to New Boston, they had to go through Arkansas, Texarkana, Arkansas, and then back into Texas.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.600
So I went through three states to get to the same.

24:42.620 --> 24:48.248
Share some interesting hitchhiking experience, as you recall, positive and or negative.

24:48.348 --> 24:57.661
Okay, well, one that didn't actually happen to me, but it was John Stevens, and I'll talk about it in there, but he was hitchhiking to New Boston.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.745
John Stevens said,

25:04.471 --> 25:09.536
in San Angelo area now, but he's a great, great man, great ag teacher.

25:10.137 --> 25:17.524
He was hitchhiking home, and he had his dog, his bird dog, he just had puppies.

25:18.245 --> 25:22.309
And so he had all these nine puppies in the box, hidden in the ditch.

25:23.210 --> 25:31.518
And he was out there hitchhiking, and this couple stopped, and he said, do you mind if I carry my dog with me, you know?

25:31.538 --> 25:34.461
And it wasn't only his dog, but it was nine puppies too.

25:34.913 --> 25:42.806
and I carried him all the way to New Boston, where his family had moved to Boston, and that's how I got to know John.

25:42.846 --> 25:48.435
I didn't know him in high school, but never any kind of dangerous time.

25:48.976 --> 25:52.221
I hitchhiked all the way up into my military career, though.

25:52.241 --> 25:55.466
What about any amusing hitchhiking experiences?

25:55.486 --> 25:57.850
No, I can't remember.

25:58.133 --> 26:01.898
A lot of them, I'm sure, if it was for any distance of time, I'd probably go to sleep.

26:01.998 --> 26:08.968
Just the first time I'd... Any times when somebody was truly kind and thoughtful to help you?

26:09.809 --> 26:13.073
I don't recall.

26:13.093 --> 26:18.100
I don't recall the particular...

26:19.092 --> 26:30.688
So any special stories, though, about your memories of court trips, some fun things or unusual things?

26:32.991 --> 26:44.847
Only that in Dallas one year, it seemed like I think there was about 17 of us stayed in one room, you know, and here we are all trying the next morning to, instead of being able to enjoy it like most

26:45.333 --> 26:47.416
colleges, ball game day.

26:47.456 --> 26:55.670
We're up early having to get our uniforms on and ready and 17 I was shaving in one sink and getting ready.

26:55.730 --> 26:59.396
That's the only thing I can remember that was just halfway.

26:59.696 --> 27:02.962
Do you remember in any town any negative?

27:03.563 --> 27:06.527
I never have, no I do not.

27:08.110 --> 27:12.437
You know later on as, yeah later

27:14.273 --> 27:15.294
You might not be ready for this.

27:15.435 --> 27:17.878
We'll get that later.

27:18.739 --> 27:24.247
In the first year or two, did anybody help you with a date at any place?

27:24.508 --> 27:33.801
Yes, and some of my buddies, they would get us the dates, usually some of the high school girls that they'd gone to high school with.

27:34.322 --> 27:36.565
Always just real nice.

27:36.585 --> 27:38.608
I never had a bad experience with any of them.

27:38.628 --> 27:41.192
They were all very nice that they...

27:41.577 --> 27:45.822
And were the young ladies treated appropriately?

27:46.202 --> 27:46.483
Yes.

27:46.663 --> 27:48.885
I would definitely have to say so.

27:48.905 --> 27:59.537
You hear a lot of stories, but the friends that I had, the ones that I ran with, they were, I never saw anybody mistreat a girl, in all honesty.

27:59.557 --> 28:01.820
So you go home Thanksgiving that first year?

28:02.541 --> 28:03.182
Yes, sir.

28:03.202 --> 28:05.204
That was the first time I got to go home.

28:05.344 --> 28:08.007
What did you tell your folks and your friends about A&M?

28:08.797 --> 28:13.584
Well, of course, by that time, I felt like I was probably going to make it.

28:13.824 --> 28:17.730
And of course, they could see a lot of change.

28:18.992 --> 28:22.057
Most of my friends were doing the same thing we did in high school.

28:22.898 --> 28:30.609
But here we were, you know, pretty much good shape and bareheaded and standing pretty tall.

28:31.611 --> 28:34.054
Were you talking proudly about A&M by then?

28:34.074 --> 28:34.375
Yes, sir.

28:35.376 --> 28:36.458
Yes, sir, I was.

28:37.019 --> 28:37.960
I was.

28:38.395 --> 28:45.324
And it had met, when I left high school, hated to leave high school, had gone through 12 years with most of the people in my class.

28:45.865 --> 29:06.192
And I never thought I'd meet anybody that I'd be closer to than them, but sure enough, in just a few months time, going through hard times together, like you do in the Corps of Fish, it's like going, not to the degree, but like, it's like going through POW or being in the war together, it's lifelong friendships when you go through hard times.

29:06.492 --> 29:07.674
That's what was beginning to take place.

29:07.694 --> 29:12.201
As you look back, had some of those friendships already started your fish year?

29:12.401 --> 29:14.124
Oh yes, yes, most definitely.

29:15.265 --> 29:30.589
Yes, and still my closest friends, there's probably seven or eight of us that are still really close, get to see each other quite often, several times a year, and go to the funerals of each of our parents and things like that.

29:30.609 --> 29:34.575
In that era, spring semester didn't end until the end of January.

29:35.095 --> 29:37.377
Yeah, that was one of the tough things back then.

29:38.058 --> 29:47.187
You'd go home for Christmas, and without having finished the semester, which means the entire time you're home for Christmas, you're worried about finals.

29:47.848 --> 29:50.671
The minute you get back, you have to start taking finals.

29:50.811 --> 29:54.695
That was a bad schedule, but that's the way it was.

29:54.735 --> 30:02.002
As you are learning about A&M academically, were there any, did you see anybody cheating?

30:03.143 --> 30:04.765
No, I do not remember.

30:05.723 --> 30:11.790
seeing that and I just, I wasn't paying attention or what, but I mean, it was stressed.

30:11.831 --> 30:15.855
You know, the Aggies don't lie to you to steal, that was believed.

30:15.956 --> 30:18.539
It was more than just a nice saying.

30:18.959 --> 30:21.222
I'm not saying that some didn't, but.

30:21.242 --> 30:23.024
How did your first semester come out academically?

30:25.367 --> 30:31.134
C's and B's, C's and B's, and I was used to making A's and B's and I was used to.

30:31.154 --> 30:34.178
Did you change away from accounting yet?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.977
I'm pretty sure I did that semester.

30:38.478 --> 30:39.559
And then you moved it to?

30:40.601 --> 30:41.502
Personnel management.

30:42.062 --> 30:43.124
Personnel management.

30:43.164 --> 30:44.766
Still in the business field.

30:44.786 --> 30:47.990
Did you turn, who did you turn to for academic advice?

30:50.093 --> 30:50.473
Was there?

30:54.238 --> 30:55.880
I know they had counselors and all.

30:55.981 --> 30:59.725
I was not one to go to a professor and talk to them or go to a counselor much.

30:59.806 --> 31:04.772
I just was not used to forcing complaints or asking questions.

31:05.157 --> 31:06.839
I just figured it was up to me to do it.

31:07.179 --> 31:11.003
What did you dream you were going to do, professionally?

31:11.183 --> 31:18.069
Well, all my life, up until I came to the realization I wasn't good enough, of course, the only thing I ever thought about being was a shortstop for the New York Yankees.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.271
And that's the truth.

31:20.291 --> 31:26.698
I didn't grow up always wanting to be a doctor or a fireman or a lawyer, but I always loved people.

31:26.838 --> 31:29.921
I knew that, and I enjoyed helping people and reaching out.

31:29.941 --> 31:34.405
And so I liked the courses that dealt with

31:35.093 --> 31:40.480
management and dealing with supervision and leadership and anything.
