WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:05.280
Today is Sunday. It is a beautiful morning, fall 
morning.

00:25.988 --> 00:29.633
Roy, do you do you remember? Who served in the bank 
here before Deadrich did? Didn't

00:35.033 --> 00:41.101
Clapton Boss serve right after Deadrich?

00:43.884 --> 00:43.984
Yeah. Well, I know Deadrich. Deadrich was the 
first man that I ever heard to bid in the bank. Well,

00:48.130 --> 00:49.812
that's the only one I could. They asked me the day 
before yesterday, and I said, Deadrich is the

00:49.892 --> 00:54.398
first man I can think of. Now, if there was another 
one before then, I don't know it. But I didn't know.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.462
Well, now let me see. Clapham Bar

01:02.544 --> 01:09.735
was, he was after debtors, I know because. Yes, I 
know that. I don't know who was before, now maybe,

01:10.998 --> 01:18.570
what about the Ropers? Well, I just don't know. I 
know that there was one of those that was connected

01:21.914 --> 01:29.121
with it at one time, but I don't remember. They have 
this open over here at Marble Falls. Yes. The Roper

01:32.044 --> 01:32.825
House. Yeah, the old Roper House. That's right. 
And I remember them because they named Roy Roper

01:35.407 --> 01:39.491
after me. Yeah. And he was my namesake. I know that. 
And that's a long time ago. Yeah, that's been

01:46.293 --> 01:49.176
plenty years ago. But I remembered, I knew that, 
too, that that was right. They did. And you know

01:56.503 --> 01:59.846
some one of the Browns. Ed Brown. Ed Brown. That's 
who it was. I couldn't think. He lived here. Old Man

02:05.691 --> 02:07.853
Shopper Brown lived down here. He lived down here 
next to Earl Rickson. I know all of that bunch down

02:10.956 --> 02:13.198
there. And they... And the Ulrichs, they just kept 
adding to their place. Old man Ulrich, you know, he

02:21.618 --> 02:24.202
was an old miser. Yes, he was. He never spent a 
nickel for anything. No, but he sure enough, he was

02:27.547 --> 02:31.954
getting the clapping bars, you know. Oh, yes. He 
married a clapping bar girl. He married a clapping

02:33.556 --> 02:35.019
bar girl. And so, you know, that all made a 
difference. And I knew them from scratch. And

02:42.890 --> 02:43.992
Helbert and all. And Willie Gore never would have 
known, got out of the first root if it hadn't been

02:44.191 --> 02:49.916
for Helmuth Clappenbaugh. Yeah. That is, well, I 
have heard my daddy say that. Oh, of course.

02:58.904 --> 03:00.125
Everybody knew that. But, you know, Willie would 
just tell stuff like, you know, he knew it all.

03:05.770 --> 03:08.132
Nobody else knew anything. And Clappenbaugh 
really passed him. I know that. That all worked

03:11.995 --> 03:13.236
out. Yeah, Brown. And Brown lived here and he had a 
grocery store here. Old Man's Hopper. They talked

03:21.071 --> 03:24.715
about Old Man Lawson called him, you know, from 
down the river. Yes, down the river. I rode old

03:25.636 --> 03:28.780
Spanish all the time, a little Spanish horse that I 
had. Of course, he played out pretty quick. And I

03:31.744 --> 03:33.325
got old Barney Gibbs then. Old Man Al Grady used to 
ride all the time. And they were my first two

03:37.530 --> 03:39.713
horses. Then Dan Crowder gave me another horse 
called Billy Boy, a rolling horse. I got up then to

03:44.627 --> 03:49.955
be about four or five years old and got to where I 
could ride. Well, I think I was 10 years old when we,

03:51.036 --> 04:01.111
nine or 10, something like that, when we moved down 
to the place down on Miller Creek. And Papa, Will

04:01.752 --> 04:06.760
Russell beat Papa for sheriff, you know, that 
year. Yes. He stayed on a couple of years, I think,

04:08.583 --> 04:12.753
and then quit. But anyhow, they just had all that 
stuff going on. You know, Uncle Buddy, Jay

04:17.565 --> 04:21.394
Chapman, was Will Russell's clerk. Or, you know, I 
said, today they call them deputies. But he

04:30.833 --> 04:33.195
clerked what they called then clerk. He kept the 
office and made out the tax reports and sheets and

04:33.215 --> 04:46.189
things and assessing work and all of that for the 
sheriff. And believe it or not, 1901,

04:51.344 --> 04:56.175
is when Russell built that house where Linden 
boyhood home. And they, in place of getting the

04:58.822 --> 05:07.362
lumber from Fredericksburg, but on account of the 
sand being so heavy, The horses and places along

05:08.422 --> 05:15.852
between, well, we always called it the old 
Schaefer Lane. You couldn't hardly get through

05:15.892 --> 05:17.154
it. It bogged down. And that Blackland Field right 
below High Store. And you just, the manuses and

05:22.762 --> 05:25.766
the... Took all day to go to all of them? 
Absolutely. And you couldn't do it. And they

05:29.231 --> 05:32.515
hauled that stuff out of here from New Brunsville. 
My goodness. Then cut through the pastures. Yeah.

05:36.181 --> 05:38.804
Oh, I know, gee whiz. And I just, and knowing that, 
you know, when I tell them those things, they don't

05:39.225 --> 05:46.574
really believe it. But I knew that Roy would 
remember about that as well as I did. And do you know

05:56.178 --> 06:10.193
that old house that was just a two-room and a porch 
that Nat Stubbs did his law practice in, you know,

05:56.178 --> 06:10.193
down there? Yeah, down here at this old house. Yes, 
right down there, back of the old garage, right in

06:11.815 --> 06:17.661
there. Well, you might say, well, he was... In his 
backyard. By the jail. Yeah, back by the jail.

06:25.376 --> 06:26.457
That's exactly right. And there was an old 
hand-dug well back there. And

06:29.720 --> 06:45.678
Vernon Crider's daddy, Rob Crider, bought that 
house and took it and built the house on the corner

06:29.720 --> 06:45.678
that leasemans live in today and stuccoed it. 
That's the old Stubbs. I didn't know that he bought

06:47.661 --> 06:50.564
it. Yeah, he bought it. Well, I didn't know 
whatever would come of it. Yes, sir. And you just

06:54.014 --> 06:54.975
took it away. He bought it for $250 and took it up 
there in the original two rooms, just like it was.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.526
He tore the porch off of it or set it up there in their 
stucco. And that was the old Nat Stubbs office.

07:07.989 --> 07:09.911
Well, I didn't know that. That Rob Crider bought 
it. Well, he did. Rob Crider bought it. that's one

07:15.980 --> 07:44.957
of the oldest houses is it now it's where uh right 
opposite the post office on the corner there oh and

07:15.980 --> 07:44.957
you know they've stuccoed it and built onto it but 
those two original rooms are still there oh meat

07:15.980 --> 07:44.957
market there yeah i knew all of that the harwood 
kids lived down there and all that say do you

07:15.980 --> 07:44.957
remember when mr when you lived up there on the 
river across the river over at the place where old

07:45.595 --> 07:50.420
Manistrigler... Lickball. Well,

07:50.440 --> 07:57.266
I was up one day, I was always trading with Mr. 
Johnson, you know. Yeah. He was just one of my best

07:58.427 --> 08:01.190
friends I ever had. And so he took you and put you on 
the front and put Margaret in the middle and... I

08:13.827 --> 08:15.850
bet it was Lennon. Not Lennon. James Ely? James Ely 
put him behind. And not a thing in the world on him.

08:24.403 --> 08:27.548
He had a little old sorrow coat there, bald-faced 
coat. And he walked up, kicked him in the end. Yeah.

08:32.576 --> 08:36.161
And he just wasn't running off. His heart scared 
him. And he went running his best right down

08:38.325 --> 08:41.269
through there. And he just hollering and laughing 
as much as he could. And we all fell off. Man, the

08:46.869 --> 08:49.854
grass burrs all over everything. And they just 
squalling and running every direction you ever

08:50.175 --> 08:53.441
saw. And you remember that? Oh, yes, I do. And why he 
did that, I never could understand. But he didn't

09:02.337 --> 09:04.000
care. You know what he'd tell us? He said, a good 
cowhand never squalled when it hit the ground. And

09:10.190 --> 09:13.095
you know, he was trying to break us from crying. But 
boy, those grass spurs would stick. Oh, don't you

09:15.458 --> 09:16.280
know. Oh, you bet. Bull nettles. And he'd always 
tell us that a good cowhand never squalled if he hit

09:18.844 --> 09:23.912
the dirt. But I'll tell you. I'll trade him old 
Arthur, an old horse I had. Yes, I remember old

09:27.998 --> 09:29.721
Arthur. Old Arthur swam that river and saved Tom 
Martin that time, don't you remember, my daddy? He

09:34.649 --> 09:35.049
what? Swam that Perknellis River in 1915 when he 
was high. Oh, yeah, yeah. That's right. He took old

09:40.157 --> 09:41.119
Arthur. Arthur would swim a river. He would swim 
anything. That's right. I trained him down there

09:45.405 --> 09:47.629
in that creek. Oh, oh. Oh, down there at Harv Davis 
Place. Yeah, that was the old lower... Miller

09:56.275 --> 09:57.236
Creek. Yeah, Miller Creek. Yeah. And do you know 
that Tom Martin was on a tree, willow tree, out,

09:58.877 --> 10:09.768
well, down below where the Texas White House is 
now. And he, the river came down. He started to

10:13.992 --> 10:15.713
cross in his buggy. He'd been to Fredericksburg to 
see Olga Priest, whom he finally married. And He

10:22.988 --> 10:26.312
had washed his horse and buggy away, and he hung 
onto a tree. And Papa came and got old Arthur, the

10:26.993 --> 10:45.936
one that Roy is talking about, and swam that river 
and put Tom on old Arthur, and he came out the river

10:26.993 --> 10:45.936
down below Grandpa Johnson's old place, which is a 
good mile from where he came in. Now, I will tell you

10:45.956 --> 10:50.582
that, and the river was really high. at that time. 
But old Arthur knew about the rivers. Yes, he did.

10:55.731 --> 10:57.334
And I tell you what I did. I traded him to him for two 
little old roan ponies, a year old and a

10:57.434 --> 11:06.010
two-year-old, and a brew horse that he got from old 
man Dederidge. That's right. Three. He gave me the

11:08.695 --> 11:10.358
three for him. You know the old... And then he got on 
him and he The first time he got after a cab, he

11:13.630 --> 11:18.121
turned back so quick he fell off over his head. 
Right, just kept riding. That's right. He would

11:22.592 --> 11:23.815
really turn. You bet. He was part perching, you 
know. Oh, yeah. And the first horse that I can

11:30.249 --> 11:35.596
remember that had a wavy mane. You remember how 
wavy that mane? Yeah, wavy mane and tail. Mane and

11:40.263 --> 11:40.744
tail. And the first one that I can ever remember 
having a wavy mane and tail. That's the perching,

11:44.690 --> 11:46.973
you know. Perching in them that showed up. It sure 
did. Of course, you know, that doesn't mean

11:50.078 --> 11:54.825
anything to the average horse. boy or girl today 
but to me that was such a pretty thing to see that

11:54.805 --> 12:24.002
that wavy mane and papa kept it the four top trim 
just so oh and it was a pretty thing he was a good

11:54.805 --> 12:24.002
horse well he was a good looking horse you bet he's a 
good looking horse good looking horse and i tell

11:54.805 --> 12:24.002
you i like it i had well i had another one before no it 
was after i had author again and i got uh Well,

12:25.096 --> 12:30.081
anyhow, Arnold Davis was working. Arnold 
Hitzfeld was working for us down at this, oh, down

12:30.121 --> 12:39.429
where British dug for the gold, you know. Yeah. 
Well, he,

12:41.211 --> 12:53.162
anyhow, I was leading this horse for Arnold to 
ride. As a mare, I believe. Anyhow, he's riding up.

12:56.791 --> 13:00.516
And he kept saying, give her slack, give her slack, 
give her slack. And I kept giving more slack. And

13:04.683 --> 13:12.554
so, you know, Arthur, he was used to whenever you 
stopped, he'd stop one. You bet. And if you run

13:13.315 --> 13:16.480
ahead of him, he'd just set back and stop. Well, he 
just turned that horse, the Somerset, by a square

13:16.801 --> 13:21.107
back on him. him, and it liked to kill him, he turned 
his back right under him, and if I hadn't had the

13:21.307 --> 13:45.721
help when I did, I guess it would have broke his 
back, but he fell sort of sideways, and he fell off

13:21.307 --> 13:45.721
in the thicket, and he sure let me hold that horse 
right after that, but he was a cow horse. He sure

13:45.821 --> 13:46.722
was. But I roped a cow on him one time, down at the 
Phillips Ranch and he couldn't run fast enough on

13:51.665 --> 14:21.283
it just to barely catch a cow and I couldn't get 
enough slack to catch to take up the slack you know I

13:51.665 --> 14:21.283
couldn't yeah and so old Arthur was going just as 
hard as he could run and that cow was going right

13:51.665 --> 14:21.283
down into a canyon down into that blocker hauler 
canyon blocker canyon down where they used to

13:51.665 --> 14:21.283
round up cattle you know and put two And I think, no, 
let me see. I believe the Johnsons had that. They

14:28.842 --> 14:30.183
had it. Yes. The blocker, huh? They had that lease. 
Yeah, I know they did. So they, he was going just as

14:34.328 --> 14:37.792
hard as he could. And I saw one of these, what you 
call these, Spanish oak. Yeah. Tickets down

14:49.966 --> 14:50.747
there. to the left, to the right, I mean. And so I 
just began to bear off as hard as I could. That cow

14:57.483 --> 15:07.714
was going right down that canyon just with an old 
bell ringing and she was running and taking him as

14:57.483 --> 15:07.714
hard as she could and he couldn't run fast enough to 
cut her off. And I was pulling as hard as I could and I

15:08.194 --> 15:18.406
saw that chick there and I went around on one side 
and she went on the other and I tell you, we met

15:08.194 --> 15:18.406
around there. And Arthur, She fell down, turned 
her feet square up, and Arthur fell square over,

15:21.153 --> 15:43.937
and his feet were up, and I went on around and 
circled around, holding the bridle rein as hard as

15:21.153 --> 15:43.937
I could, and like to kill me, you know, I was right on 
top of all those legs and things, and the fella come

15:21.153 --> 15:43.937
down, I believe it was Valdrick or somebody. I 
imagine it was Val because he lived there. Yeah, he

15:46.787 --> 15:48.231
lived on the place. And so we finally got the thing 
settled up and she went on down and I didn't bother

15:48.732 --> 15:54.326
her either. I never did look any more for her. But he 
couldn't run fast enough to catch any, he could

15:56.752 --> 16:02.145
barely run fast enough to head a cow. You know, B, 
people, you tell people today that these sage

16:02.125 --> 16:17.405
hills out here and all around here were not covered 
with Spanish oak back in the early days. That's a

16:17.425 --> 16:19.568
come-late deal here. No, we had very few. When he 
said that Spanish oak thicket, let me tell you

16:21.451 --> 16:29.061
there were few and far between, and that was a 
landmark. You'd say, well, I'll meet you at such

16:29.041 --> 16:32.067
and such place. And the Spanish oak thicket down 
there on the other side of the gorge, you knew where

16:32.167 --> 16:38.981
it would be because there wasn't any Spanish oaks. 
Very few in through here. And another thing, the

16:41.205 --> 16:44.652
cedar, there wasn't any cedar. No. We didn't have 
cedar like we have now. But what they did have was

16:47.317 --> 16:49.381
good cedar. You bet. It was virgin cedar. It wasn't 
this come up and bush out. It really was a different

16:55.652 --> 16:58.617
type. This whole holding place down here on the 
river now where Dr. Burleson's old place, he has it

16:58.778 --> 17:08.996
all, everything, oh, it's old, old, old. And... 
The cedar is just as good today as it was the day it

17:09.946 --> 17:14.113
was cut. It's all hard cedar. That's right. And you 
just think you're... Well, that old house that we

17:16.477 --> 17:34.266
tore down on the ranch down there was cypress 
lumber that was milled back in 18 and 58, and I'm

17:16.477 --> 17:34.266
taking the outside... part of it and you can't cut 
it now you may think you can but uh those pieces that

17:34.246 --> 17:51.597
are short enough i'm going to use every one i'm on 
this porch and i'm going to burn in it when it was

17:34.246 --> 17:51.597
milled And when it was borrowed, who put it up? See, 
that old place that we have is a land grant place,

17:54.736 --> 18:05.788
and the deed to it is larger than a... I mean, the 
land grant deed that was signed by Governor Davis

18:06.072 --> 18:22.103
of Texas is, well, I guess it's, I don't guess 
anything about it, but it's at least two feet long

18:06.072 --> 18:22.103
and two feet wide, square. It looks like a big 
diploma of some description. that I gave to Corky

18:26.812 --> 18:48.702
because naturally he'd be the one to get it but now 
that is something else and and to know that old old

18:26.812 --> 18:48.702
lumber is still going to be used oh it's good this is 
good it's still elastic just as good as it ever did

18:26.812 --> 18:48.702
and you know this that we had some ash that were used 
for beams in that house. My goodness, you can't cut

18:53.826 --> 18:55.468
it. It's so solid and heavy as it can be. How did they 
mill it then? Well, when it's green, you can do it.

19:04.381 --> 19:04.701
Oh, you can. But after it seasons, it's just like 
rock. Well, just a few people had a broad ax, you

19:09.488 --> 19:16.236
know, and they used it, you know, just like these 
size blades, you know. I've got an old size blade

19:16.336 --> 19:26.708
out there, and I've got a cradle Grandfather 
Jackman used in cutting grain. You know, he taught

19:27.008 --> 19:30.172
me how to stack hay, too. Is that right? He taught 
me. They put me right on the stack with this.

19:35.257 --> 19:40.143
Grandpa Chapman and he showed me just where to pull 
it and all that. And we'd thrash and I'd stack. And

19:42.305 --> 19:49.553
do you know, Bea, you have two different 
pitchforks. One that you use to throw it on the

19:49.573 --> 19:55.220
wagon with and one you use to stack with. That's 
right. The handles are made different and the

19:56.842 --> 20:00.125
prongs are made different. Right, Roy? Three and 
four prongs. That's right. I didn't know that. You

20:04.310 --> 20:05.411
bet that's right. Mother asked me the other day. 
She was out getting weeds out of my backyard and old

20:07.954 --> 20:12.258
dead grass. And she said, have you got a pitchfork? 
And I said, what in the hell use would I have for a

20:14.521 --> 20:18.045
pitchfork? I haven't seen one since I was a kid. I 
said, no, I got a shovel, but I sure as hell haven't

20:20.567 --> 20:23.510
got a pitchfork. And I thought, well, Mother, you 
must be out of your mind. Where would I get a

20:26.814 --> 20:28.956
pitchfork? If I had one, I'd have it hanging in my 
house so nobody would steal it. Well, when I told

20:33.259 --> 20:45.966
them that you had different styles for when I 
worked at the old Johnson settlement, do you know

20:33.259 --> 20:45.966
they looked at me Like you're an idiot. Like I was an 
idiot. That's exactly right. And they couldn't

20:50.476 --> 20:51.697
believe it. Oh, that's right. They had three and 
four prongs. And you had to use one for one and one

20:57.045 --> 21:00.330
for the other. And to stack it,

21:00.950 --> 21:06.899
it had a bowl. I never will forget Mrs. Johnson. We 
were across the river over there to Culberson

21:12.170 --> 21:16.737
Place, you know. Yeah. And the old house that lived 
over on the north side. The north side of the, yeah.

21:23.567 --> 21:34.723
And so this fellow Culberson, oh, I don't know 
whether he lived there then or not, but anyhow, he,

21:23.567 --> 21:34.723
Mr. Johnson was there, and they had the pens down 
there, too, up on the side of the hill. And so, Mr., I

21:35.544 --> 21:41.333
don't know what, uh, uh, James Eady was riding now, 
but some horse. I'll bet he was riding. It was a

21:47.557 --> 21:56.306
gentle horse, but anyhow, he says, hadn't even 
yet, James Eady, the slick rock crossing there,

21:47.557 --> 21:56.306
it's all slick. It's bad. You bet he sure was. He 
went trotting off down that way and said, hurry up

21:58.509 --> 22:03.174
there, hurry up there. Sitting up there like old 
Jim Chapman. Make him run. And James Ely never

22:10.557 --> 22:13.301
needed to get him into a run. You know, he just lay 
him a trot. And he's just like old Jim Chapman. You

22:18.670 --> 22:28.745
know, Papa, my daddy would get after Ely more times 
than one because he wouldn't hustle. But James Ely

22:28.765 --> 22:33.713
wasn't the fast-moving type. He just never did get 
up in a hurry. And Margaret and I were always just

22:38.052 --> 22:42.877
fast as lightning. But James Ely was never quick, 
uh-uh, never in a hurry. Well, I tell you that the

22:47.121 --> 22:52.706
old man Culberson, he lived there. He says, Carl, 
don't let old Ray Ranger run away with you now. And

23:00.814 --> 23:01.675
showing up. Old Carl didn't care how you run. He'd 
start home with him. He'd start to running. He'd

23:06.790 --> 23:11.824
just sit up there and whip him and let him go and run 
him just as hard as he could. And he knew all was

23:11.844 --> 23:14.772
crazy about Bessie Scofield. Oh, yeah. He sure 
was. You know... You look back and think about

23:18.462 --> 23:22.829
these things in your early childhood. Do you know 
it wasn't anything, or it didn't excite us,

23:22.869 --> 23:31.703
Margaret and I, one bit, if our daddy put us on a 
horse. If he put us on there, he expected us to ride.

23:35.969 --> 23:37.912
And he didn't expect us. He would tell us that a horn 
of a saddle wasn't used to hold you. It was used to

23:43.240 --> 23:46.225
wrap the rope around you. I can remember that just 
as well if it is yesterday. He said, if you want to

23:49.951 --> 23:53.738
stay on, you ride with your knees. And I'll never 
forget that, you know, in riding. Well, you do. You

23:59.447 --> 24:03.474
clamp, and you hold tight, and your spurs will 
balance. But you balance yourself with your

24:03.835 --> 24:11.487
reins, bridle reins, and it's not one person out of 
a hundred will do it. That's right. You're right.

24:13.350 --> 24:15.252
If you're a good rider, you balance your... He's 
gonna do that, too. Oh, listen, Mr. Johnson was a

24:16.914 --> 24:20.117
good one, I tell you. He was a real man. He... It 
tickles me. I told Corky about that the other day. I

24:29.328 --> 24:32.011
said, I don't know how old I was, but I was just a kid. 
Just a little one. Oh, I guess maybe I could have

24:34.253 --> 24:38.318
been 10, 11 years old, but not much more. They was 
having races down here at Cypress Mills. And Roy

24:42.204 --> 24:45.313
was looking for somebody to ride his horse. He 
wanted to sell it for Polo Horse. That's when all

24:47.720 --> 24:51.430
this bunch of Atlanta old Yeah, those Hardin boys, 
they were good. Yes, they were. Margaret

24:57.970 --> 25:12.066
Burleson and I were there, and they mounted us on 
horses, and we rode in races at Cypress Mill just

24:57.970 --> 25:12.066
like veterans. We mounted at the Kirkendall 
Ranch, too. Yeah, down at the Kirkendall Ranch. We

25:16.651 --> 25:20.836
went down there, and we went down and helped put on a 
show down there. That's right. We had races, you

25:22.493 --> 25:30.199
know, for the, and this, oh, yeah, I got one horse 
from, uh, Bernison. Yeah? That he was a racehorse.

25:32.720 --> 25:37.345
If you'd whip him, he'd outrun any horse that they 
ever run him against. And if you didn't whip him,

25:37.705 --> 25:41.048
he'd stop right in the middle of the track. 
Absolutely. You remember my daddy's hollering?

25:45.333 --> 25:47.194
Daddy had the shrewdest voice. Shrill, I mean. And 
he'd say, put the bud to her, sister. Put the bud to

25:50.938 --> 25:51.979
him. And I'd just bring that old whip back just like 
that. I can remember that just as well as it is

25:55.923 --> 25:59.006
yesterday. But to think about... Those things 
what you and then you see the youth of today. They

26:09.212 --> 26:12.422
couldn't ride a stick horse around the block 
without falling down. That's true.

26:17.067 --> 26:19.409
But I guess I couldn't do a lot of it. I'll tell you, 
you couldn't. I couldn't ride a skateboard, and

26:21.271 --> 26:25.715
they can do that, so I guess it evens up. I'd 
probably break my neck on a skateboard. Nobody

26:29.219 --> 26:33.082
rides except barrel races and roping and things 
like that. You couldn't pin a milk cow on a horse.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.107
No, they couldn't do it to save their soul. My daddy 
used to say, if you can't get on a horse and follow a

26:38.988 --> 26:46.635
cow, bring it in. you'll just never amount to a hell 
of beans. Well, we had to work. We had to work hard.

26:54.677 --> 26:56.659
We had to work day in and day out. I was thinking 
about these whole steers, Tom Stribble, and we had

26:57.400 --> 27:04.489
to deliver them around the mountain.

27:07.013 --> 27:08.134
And we Well, we cut through the pasture. Went 
through the hide pocket and then right straight on

27:12.410 --> 27:15.154
through. You know what we had, though, when we got 
to Armand Ware's? That's a horse of another color.

27:23.085 --> 27:25.128
We had the detour there. But anyway, we finally 
came out to old Salter Springs. Mm-hmm. And then

27:31.317 --> 27:36.246
brought them up the river, I mean up the lane there. 
And got over to Ms. Stribling's, the old Stribling

27:37.047 --> 27:46.444
Ranch, and pinned them. We would take them over to 
Marble Falls. We had to help Tom drive those things

27:48.828 --> 27:52.034
into Marble Falls. We spent the night there. And I, 
Miss, Grandma Striblin had come in from the Zeke

27:55.263 --> 28:10.202
tank fishing, and she had a turtle, and she cooked 
that turtle, and she said to Margaret and I, said,

27:55.263 --> 28:10.202
well, you want something to eat supper? And 
Margaret said, I'm awful hungry. Tom said, well,

28:13.607 --> 28:16.430
Ma, give these kids something to eat. They're 
hungry. They've worked. And so she gave us a bowl of

28:18.853 --> 28:21.777
turtle soup. And Margaret looked at it, and she 
smelled it, and she said, what kind of soup is this?

28:27.317 --> 28:31.092
She says, Tuttle soup. Margaret pushed it back, 
and she asked me, said, aren't you going to eat

28:31.797 --> 28:36.082
that? I said, no, ma'am. I don't believe I'm 
hungry. And she said, oh, you're too high-toned to

28:41.509 --> 28:45.314
eat turtle, I guess. And Margaret said, I don't 
know whether I'm too high-toned, but I don't want

28:46.655 --> 28:51.141
turtle soup. And then we walked out on the porch. 
And Tom gave each one of us 20 cents. And we went over

29:00.085 --> 29:08.054
to Blastie's store, and we brought a nickel box of 
crackers and a nickel box of sardines. Can you beat

29:08.074 --> 29:09.036
that? Yeah. And then we got the rest of it in stick 
candy. Oh, my gosh. That's the way they did it. I

29:16.921 --> 29:20.707
know that things like that happen. You know it, and 
to think about it today is just unreal. Yeah.

29:26.717 --> 29:28.459
Sardines, 89 cents a can. Yes. Cheapest sardines. 
Cheapest ones you can get. Well, I tell you that Mr.

29:32.025 --> 29:39.176
Johnson, he was a good friend of mine. Really a good 
friend of mine. He worked us, I guarantee you. But,

29:42.823 --> 29:47.368
you know, in reality, it didn't hurt you. No. You 
know, I rode old Carrie. Old Carrie Nation? He'd go

29:50.672 --> 29:58.621
to roping, loan me a horse, and take my horse, and 
ride my horse. And I could rope a goat. I could do

30:00.683 --> 30:01.504
that. And I...

30:01.524 --> 30:09.253
Oh, no, I don't have anything for that. Oh, no, 
unless you... Another thing that was quite

30:10.921 --> 30:15.068
amusing was Sid Hyde. You know, he's the best roper 
that you ever saw in the pasture. He never caught

30:18.974 --> 30:20.416
one in the... In an arena in his life. You couldn't 
get him... He couldn't catch one in the arena with a

30:23.601 --> 30:27.327
100-foot... rope or anything. No, sir. He just 
couldn't. You put him in the brush, he'd just take

30:29.894 --> 30:33.178
and throw. He'd just catch one any way you wanted 
him. But he couldn't do it in front of people or in an

30:35.781 --> 30:40.346
arena to show off. Well, Harry could do it. Yeah, 
Harry could. He could just run in. And I let him have

30:45.471 --> 30:48.074
a horse one time. I let Harry, not Harry, but Ed have 
a horse, a Dunn horse I called Butter. brought him

30:56.804 --> 31:24.988
out at uh above Kerrville there and uh I don't 
remember where the shoemaker the fella had his

30:56.804 --> 31:24.988
horse and I paid a hundred and fifty dollars 
hundred dollars for him and I don't know I think I

30:56.804 --> 31:24.988
paid a good big price for it at that time but anyhow 
that horse was a racehorse he was Davis had the

31:25.643 --> 31:27.566
Othello Davis had the sire on him. And he, Rattler 
Cole, he was by Rattler, that's what it was. And so

31:33.255 --> 31:52.985
he took pistol load and I was riding him when Dick 
was, I brought those horses down from Rock Springs

31:33.255 --> 31:52.985
and I came through Blanco's and missed having to go 
through, you know, quarantine. Yeah. And I got

31:54.095 --> 31:58.131
over there and then Dick was riding a little old 
Spanish mare.
