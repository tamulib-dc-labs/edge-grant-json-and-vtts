00:02.123 --> 00:04.627
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, 
two, three, four. This is the 27th, 9th of May, and

00:09.816 --> 00:27.625
we're at 2100 Vinewood, Owen Word, in Bryan, and I 
have the pleasure and honor of recording the A&M

00:09.816 --> 00:27.625
Memories of Joe Hanover. Mr. Hanover, as we begin, 
introduce yourself to anyone who will hear this

00:28.313 --> 00:34.584
tape or read the typed version. Describe family 
background, growing up, what did your mom and dad

00:35.446 --> 00:45.023
do, where'd y'all live, where'd you go to high 
school, all about yourself before you go to A&M.

00:46.506 --> 00:47.568
Okay, I'm Joe. I go by Joe G. Hanover. because there 
were two Johanovers and we had to distinguish

00:50.858 --> 00:54.624
between them. In 1925, my family moved to the 
little village of Wheelock, which is about 20

00:56.107 --> 01:04.581
miles northeast of Bryan. My father was a cattle 
farmer, had sharecroppers on the place. I went to

01:12.173 --> 01:15.178
grammar school in Wheelock. through the ninth 
grade, I guess it was, and at that time the high

01:16.660 --> 01:25.876
school had to go to Franklin. We did not have eleven 
grades in Wheelock, so they were bused to

01:26.077 --> 01:31.667
Franklin. I did my tenth and eleventh grades in 
Franklin.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.952
Graduated from there in 1936. How many in your 
senior class? At Franklin? Oh,

01:48.442 --> 01:53.931
I imagine 20 maybe.

01:58.238 --> 02:04.909
And as you were thinking about what to do after high 
school, what led you to go to college? I knew when I

02:05.868 --> 02:09.033
went to college what I wanted to do, Haskell. No, 
but who encouraged you to go to college? I knew what

02:14.283 --> 02:24.019
I wanted to do because back in the late 20s and early 
30s, the highway department was rebuilding the

02:14.283 --> 02:24.019
old San Antonio Road. And I followed the survey 
crew up and down that road as far as I could from my

02:25.382 --> 02:30.711
home. and said to everybody, I want to be a civil 
engineer when I go to college. And that was run by a

02:36.702 --> 02:41.572
man by the name of Bill Cape. C-A-P-E? C-A-P-E, who 
was, I believe, city manager of Bryan at one time,

02:43.636 --> 02:52.513
and ultimately was city manager of Houston. And he 
was an A&M graduate. And that's where I got the idea

02:56.613 --> 03:00.878
of what I wanted to do when I got, when I went to 
college. Because I'm assuming that your parents

03:00.898 --> 03:04.183
were not college graduates. They were not. And I'm 
assuming that A&M was your choice because you knew

03:06.866 --> 03:16.118
about it and knew about its strengths in signal 
engineering. And it was close to home. Now you were

03:19.038 --> 03:20.921
born where? McGregor, Texas. In McGregor. That's 
about 20 miles west of Waco. Yeah. Now why did your

03:25.428 --> 03:27.971
family move from McGregor to Wheelock? Well, my 
father was in the cotton gin business in McGregor,

03:29.033 --> 03:35.963
along with the grain business. He and another 
gentleman up there, and in 1923 or 1924, I've

03:36.785 --> 03:45.838
forgotten which it was, his gin burned. And he told 
his partner that if he'd take what insurance they

03:46.291 --> 03:58.489
had and take the business, that he would pull out of 
it and come to Wheelock and help his father manage

03:46.291 --> 03:58.489
his farm. He had about 1,400 acres there, as I said, 
with sharecroppers and ran cattle and needed some

03:59.491 --> 04:06.441
help. So that's why we went there. What were the 
money crops on that 1,400 acres? Cotton and corn.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.071
Cotton and corn. Cotton and corn. That's only two 
things they raised. But y'all also had chickens

04:15.535 --> 04:21.226
and a few hogs and garden and orchard and 
everything. Right. Had everything that you'd in

04:22.749 --> 04:24.793
the kitchen. Before you came to A&M to enroll, you 
had visited the campus? Yeah, I had been to that

04:32.022 --> 04:35.026
campus a number of times. My dad used the 
veterinary hospital for his animals if he had to

04:35.106 --> 04:41.995
have something to... So many times I visited the 
campus with him through the veterinary

04:42.015 --> 04:47.742
department. And what impression did those visits 
to A&M make on you and your family? Well, of course,

04:53.890 --> 04:58.536
I knew I wanted to go there in the first place and And 
the more we went there, the more I liked it and the

04:58.516 --> 05:14.582
more infatuated with it was, I guess you might say, 
and also knew of these engineers that preceded me

04:58.516 --> 05:14.582
that I knew of. Now 1936 was a tough year 
financially. What kind of money did you have to

05:18.985 --> 05:25.632
help finance your freshman year? I had one cow and 
sold one calf every year and I lived at home. My

05:34.981 --> 05:47.153
grandfather had an old 1929 Chevrolet and he told 
me if I could keep it running and keep some people

05:34.981 --> 05:47.153
riding with me to help pay the expenses, I could 
drive back and forth and live at home. So I would get

05:48.112 --> 05:57.245
up every morning, help milk seven cows, drive to 
A&M, go to school, take the passengers that worked

05:48.112 --> 05:57.245
at A&M.

06:00.109 --> 06:10.825
The AAA had employees, as the Extension Service 
had employees, and then two or three students. I

06:10.885 --> 06:14.550
always had a carload, and they shared my expenses 
with me. What time did you get up? Before daylight.

06:19.365 --> 06:23.950
Oh, high school I must have gotten up, oh, 530 or so. 
And you'd milk those seven cattle. We used to milk

06:27.774 --> 06:28.915
seven. And then... Had to help feed the horses and 
mules, eat my breakfast, get dressed and drive 20

06:29.315 --> 06:38.064
miles to A&M. And it took about how long to drive 
that 20 miles? About 45 minutes at that time. You

06:43.310 --> 06:48.097
came down what is now... Old San Antonio Road. OSR. 
OSR. And then we came through what we call the

06:50.760 --> 06:57.249
Cameron Ranch Road, which is now 2223. It cuts 
across from San Antonio Road and comes in on the

06:57.289 --> 07:08.625
Table Road just east of Bryan. About how many 
riders did you have? Well, it was a six passenger

07:12.170 --> 07:16.616
car and I always had five besides myself. Okay, so 
you filled it up. Filled it up. Did they pay for

07:19.260 --> 07:21.624
anything other than gas? No, they didn't. In fact, 
I would charge them just a specified amount each

07:24.868 --> 07:31.678
time, which was just to cover my expenses. So you 
didn't make any profit on that? No, I didn't, not

07:33.781 --> 07:37.887
really.

07:37.867 --> 07:41.154
first came down to how did you get admitted? What 
was the admissions process there? I don't even

07:44.020 --> 07:44.762
know. I've thought about that a lot of times. I 
don't know. I really don't know how I got admitted.

07:52.478 --> 07:54.202
Don't know what the process was. Right. You had to 
be officially in the Corps. but you were a day

07:59.095 --> 08:00.498
student. Describe how... Well, there was day 
student organizations in the Corps. I belonged to

08:08.211 --> 08:11.537
a day student Coast Artillery outfit. And even 
though I was taking engineering, the reason I was

08:13.180 --> 08:21.475
in the Coast Artillery, I was advised that they 
liked the engineers in the Coastal Artillery

08:22.298 --> 08:45.961
because all of our spotting and projecting and 
manning tables and all were calculated with slide

08:22.298 --> 08:45.961
rules and tables to project the, I mean to 
anticipate the projectile trajectory and how far

08:22.298 --> 08:45.961
they'd go and this sort of thing. So I was 
encouraged to get in the Coastal Artillery. Now

08:50.005 --> 08:51.647
had you made good grades in high school? I did. I 
guess above average.

08:59.786 --> 09:02.472
What kind of math did you take in high school? Do you 
remember how far up the ladder you went? took

09:04.975 --> 09:15.130
trigonometry, took no calculus, took 
trigonometry and several arithmetics or

09:04.975 --> 09:15.130
whatever they had. Solid geometry and playing. 
We're talking about the math you had had in high

09:18.676 --> 09:22.902
school. I had geometry and

09:29.292 --> 09:31.335
Do you remember what sciences you had? Did you have 
physics? Yeah. No, I had no physics.

09:38.423 --> 09:38.984
Chemistry? No chemistry, unfortunately. And 
that made it tough at A&M. When did you learn to use

09:46.093 --> 09:47.955
the slide rule? At A&M. At A&M, okay. No, I didn't 
have none of that in high school. When you came down

09:52.941 --> 09:56.025
here to enroll, Who advised you what courses to 
take your freshman year?

10:03.081 --> 10:18.500
Well, there must have been some advisors where I 
was enrolling, because they're the ones that

10:03.081 --> 10:18.500
suggested I get into Coast Artillery, and I'm sure 
they're the ones that advised me what to take. You

10:20.402 --> 10:22.785
know, Haskell, that's been so far back. I hear you. 
Now you were issued a whole bunch of uniforms.

10:29.665 --> 10:30.005
Yeah. And so when you came each day you wore your 
core uniforms. Either that or your fatigues. I

10:38.753 --> 10:44.598
had, you know, we had sort of coverall like things 
that we wore on certain days. Right. Describe,

10:45.499 --> 10:48.802
describe a typical class day. You got up what time 
and did what and where did you, when you came to

10:49.823 --> 10:54.987
campus, where did you park? There was one parking 
place on the campus. Only day students were

10:59.958 --> 11:02.762
allowed on the campus with a car. And it was...

11:03.724 --> 11:11.936
Well, there used to be a big water tower up behind 
the power plant. On the north side of the campus?

11:13.458 --> 11:13.758
Yes. There was a big parking lot right there, and 
that's where we parked. We'd come in in the

11:20.077 --> 11:27.248
morning, I would go by and let the workers out, and 
that's the only way you could drive on the campus.

11:27.268 --> 11:34.319
In fact, time or two I got a ticket for driving on the 
campus before they knew I was authorized to take

11:27.268 --> 11:34.319
these workers. And come back and I'd park. Well, if 
I didn't have a class, I'd go to the library and

11:37.384 --> 11:42.451
study, or study in the car. And if I had as much as two 
hours, I worked. I had a student labor job with the

11:49.253 --> 11:52.135
landscape department. There was a fellow by the 
name of Horsley that managed the student labor,

11:52.756 --> 12:02.304
and I was fortunate enough to get a student labor 
job. Was it Graham Horsley? Wendell Horsley?

12:04.246 --> 12:04.906
Wendell Horsley. Wendell Horsley. And I worked 
for the landscape department, and I did

12:06.968 --> 12:12.353
everything in the world. Dug in the flower beds, 
pushed lawn mowers, picked the mealybugs off the

12:19.915 --> 12:24.568
the big flowers in that greenhouse. What were some 
of the special new projects? Was the grand

12:28.639 --> 12:33.132
driveway going out to Texas Avenue Were those 
trees already set out when you got here? Some of

12:36.609 --> 12:37.850
them. Some of them were set out after I was there. 
And I helped set out trees. I helped dig them in

12:44.176 --> 12:45.857
the... They grew their own out in the nursery. And 
part of the job at times would go out and dig them.

12:52.463 --> 12:54.165
Where was the nursery? It was out... Well, if you 
come... It's...

13:03.200 --> 13:04.642
I don't know what street. Was it west of the tracks? 
No, no, it was east of the tracks. It was back toward

13:10.729 --> 13:22.643
Bryan on the big boulevard that comes out to 
University from Bryan and stops there by the big

13:10.729 --> 13:22.643
engineering building. Back on that road, back 
behind those buildings that they built out there

13:28.630 --> 13:31.353
where the students used to live. Okay, back at 
College View. Yeah, right. That's where a lot of

13:33.977 --> 13:38.202
the nursery was. Was a young man named Bob Rucker 
working? Yes. I worked with Bob. Bob lived in the

13:45.170 --> 13:46.492
greenhouse. That's what I heard. Bob lived in the 
greenhouse and got part of his expenses paid by

13:47.774 --> 13:54.522
looking after the greenhouse. Because he was from 
Franklin. That's right. I knew him in Franklin. He

13:58.803 --> 14:08.236
was a year or two ahead of me, but Bob Rucker was a, he 
was a special sort of a student with the landscape

13:58.803 --> 14:08.236
department. Describe Mr. Horsley and his manner 
of working with people. Well, I think he just came

14:16.808 --> 14:20.453
there about the time I did. He was, he was new there. 
I don't know whether he came for that purpose or

14:22.917 --> 14:29.524
whether that was settled off onto him about the 
student labor. But he was a real nice fellow as far

14:30.285 --> 14:37.873
as the students were concerned, but well liked. We 
all thought he treated us very well. He didn't have

14:42.758 --> 14:45.701
any of the management of the labor done. He was more 
of the administrative part of the student labor.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.888
What was the pay of you, of you as a student laborer? 
Thirty cents an hour. And about how many hours a

14:54.231 --> 14:55.956
week did you work? Well, I could work, I could work 
40 hours a month. And I could work anytime I had as

15:01.251 --> 15:04.500
much as two hours. They wouldn't let you work one 
hour, but I could work any time I had two hours. And

15:09.798 --> 15:12.921
did you do that all four years? I did. And I sort of 
had the insight on that labor. Mr. Hensel, who was

15:19.948 --> 15:26.675
head of the landscape department, was a friend of 
my daddy's sister. And she told him I needed a job

15:27.196 --> 15:31.200
down there. And so he was... managed to get me on to 
the landscape student labor. Did you do that your

15:37.581 --> 15:39.743
first semester? I did from the time I started. All 
four years? Plus all three summers. See my writers

15:45.549 --> 15:58.021
had to be there in the summer and I usually took one 
or two courses less in the long term and I'd pick it

15:45.549 --> 15:58.021
up in the summer because I could work in the summer. 
I could make a little more in the summer as I

15:58.041 --> 16:00.323
remember. As far as you can recall, about how much 
did it cost for you to go to A&M then? I can tell you

16:06.827 --> 16:08.169
pretty close. Okay. Out of pocket, Haskell. Out of 
pocket. For four years and three summers, about

16:13.413 --> 16:15.896
$500. Plus your books? Or were the books included 
in that? Well, that's what it took for me to go to

16:22.622 --> 16:25.965
A&M. And how much of that did you earn? Oh, well, 
it's about $40 a month. I mean $30, let's see, $30 a

16:37.159 --> 16:40.084
month. And see, that would be what, oh, 180 or

16:41.506 --> 16:56.972
whatever $30 a month would come out to.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.247
See, that was part of what I spent. In other words, 
over and above that, it was my $500, as I'm talking

17:00.748 --> 17:07.497
about. So I went to school pretty economically. 
Now, as you began your college, did your mother or

17:14.327 --> 17:20.817
your dad or anyone else give you any instructions? 
Well, they'd give me instructions before I

17:22.219 --> 17:26.605
started. Oh, I had a very, very encouraging 
parents, not only when I got to college, but high

17:27.108 --> 17:41.455
school, church, community, the whole business. 
It didn't take much encouraging. I knew what I

17:44.180 --> 17:47.867
wanted, and they furnished all the backup that I 
needed. My dad told me, when I got ready to go to A&M,

17:50.953 --> 17:57.159
he said, I don't have money to send you to A&M. 
Didn't have any money to send me. And said, with

18:00.002 --> 18:04.766
this automobile, I'll furnish your meals at home, 
of course. Mother will fix your lunch. I took a

18:06.908 --> 18:07.589
lunch. Didn't have to buy lunch down there. And he 
said, if you can make it, well, that'll be fine.

18:12.654 --> 18:14.236
We'd be happy. What was the typical lunch that you 
brought? A couple of sandwiches. Made out of what?

18:19.782 --> 18:20.503
Homemade bread. And what kind of meat? Sausage 
that they'd made at home, or ham, or bacon that they

18:23.907 --> 18:29.595
had killed the hogs on. And where would you eat that 
lunch? Sitting in the car. In the car. Did you drink

18:34.902 --> 18:35.923
anything? I brought water, just brought water 
from home. And then there was fountains in the It

18:43.062 --> 18:46.906
was right next to what then was called the 
Mechanical Engineering Building. I don't know

18:46.927 --> 18:47.988
what it is now. And then there was a cotton mill on 
the backside of it over there too. So we could use

18:53.474 --> 19:00.062
that for our restrooms and water fountains. Now 
where would you change your clothes to get out of

19:00.963 --> 19:09.593
your uniforms to put on your work clothes? I'd do 
mine over at the

19:10.940 --> 19:25.642
landscape building, where the

19:10.940 --> 19:25.642
flowers were grown.

19:29.308 --> 19:30.089
The horticulture? No, the landscape building, 
where Robert Rucker had his room over there.

19:38.513 --> 19:40.840
What do you call it where you keep flowers? 
Greenhouse? Greenhouse. That's what I'm trying

19:42.886 --> 19:44.431
to think of. Over at the greenhouse. Just bring 
them along in the car and hang them up. All right, so

19:50.782 --> 19:52.685
you would leave home 6.30? Tried to leave by 7. 
Because nobody had to be there before 8. Then go to

20:03.184 --> 20:04.586
class. Generally, did you do your landscape work 
in the afternoons? Whenever I had two hours. It

20:12.567 --> 20:14.529
could be morning or afternoon. Now, as officially 
a member of the Coast Artillery Company, when did

20:16.612 --> 20:24.523
that company gather on campus? Did you all have to 
fall out? One afternoon, on a Thursday afternoon.

20:30.511 --> 20:32.834
And what did you do that afternoon? Well, we'd go to 
the armory. They had a six-inch gun down there, had

20:36.682 --> 20:57.002
the rifles, had an indoor rifle range, and then had 
class work on artillery, artillery spotting,

20:36.682 --> 20:57.002
projectiles, the tables and all for the 
artillery. And that's, it was, and then we'd go out

20:57.657 --> 21:07.623
and do close order drill out on the drill field. Now 
did your outfit have a nickname?

21:12.136 --> 21:13.037
Don't believe. Your Coast Artillery Company? 
Don't believe. I don't remember it if we did. Was

21:16.261 --> 21:18.183
it, what was it, C-1? What was its, did it have a 
designation? Well, they were A, B, Company A, I

21:21.086 --> 21:27.133
mean, Battery. We were Batteries. Battery. What 
Battery were y'all? Do you remember? Well, it was

21:32.298 --> 21:33.880
the day student. Seemed to me like it was D Battery. 
About how many were in that outfit?

21:42.342 --> 21:48.069
I expect there was 75 probably, right, at Haskell. 
Did y'all get hazed? I didn't, being a day student.

21:54.518 --> 21:55.879
See, I'm not living on the campus. I was never 
involved in hazing at all. And were, now was

21:59.123 --> 22:02.768
everybody in the company a day student? In that 
particular company. That's what I mean. That was a

22:05.812 --> 22:06.973
day student company. Was there a nickname? Were 
y'all called Day Ducks? Yes, that's what they

22:10.478 --> 22:12.180
were. How did you learn Aggie slang, Aggie 
traditions, and all that? Where did they? Just by

22:19.160 --> 22:22.444
association, I guess. Of course, not living in the 
dormitory, I didn't get a lot of that that some of

22:23.045 --> 22:27.951
them did. Did you have to whip out to upperclassmen 
as you walked across the campus? Oh, yeah. You had

22:33.078 --> 22:38.124
to yes sir and no sir and all that, you know. 
Describe as much as you can The courses you had that

22:41.675 --> 22:46.260
first year, what were some of the key courses and 
the key teachers? I had English, two courses of

22:46.701 --> 22:53.228
English, first and second English. I had algebra, 
algebra one and two. I believe the first year I had

22:58.734 --> 23:03.239
trigonometry. And then somewhere down the line I 
had two terms of calculus. I don't know what year.

23:09.902 --> 23:11.604
That probably was the second, maybe. What about 
physics? I had physics. I'd be physical the first

23:14.128 --> 23:16.532
year, if I'm not mistaken. And that physics and 
chemistry really was tough on me, not having it in

23:17.874 --> 23:25.706
high school. About how big were those classes? Oh, 
20 or 25. Do you remember any of the teachers? Oh, I

23:37.342 --> 23:37.723
do. Please describe them. Okay. I remember my 
chemistry teacher. His name was Koenig.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.396
K-O-E-N-I-G? Yes. And he lived here in Bryan, and 
there's some streets named for him here. He owned

23:50.445 --> 23:51.447
some property. He was my freshman chemistry 
teacher. I knew I was going to fail from the time I

23:55.992 --> 23:58.436
started. He had a brogue, he was a German, deep 
brogue, and he taught to the level of students

24:00.019 --> 24:10.456
who'd had it in high school, and I knew I wasn't 
going to make it. But I stayed with it, I guess I

24:11.057 --> 24:18.449
learned something, and then turned right around 
and took it in summer school and made a B on it. But

24:18.469 --> 24:19.992
that's the first First course I ever failed, high 
school or any other time.

24:27.725 --> 24:37.197
But the guys that, you know, that had had 
chemistry, oh, they could answer all the

24:27.725 --> 24:37.197
questions, you know, and as I say, I knew I was going 
to fail. What about English? Do you remember who

24:40.782 --> 24:41.823
taught that? I got my old longhorn out trying to 
figure out my English teacher. He was from Bryan

24:47.831 --> 24:49.253
here. And I can see him, but I can't tell you what his 
name was. One of them. What about math? Well, the

24:59.062 --> 25:10.978
math teachers were...

24:59.062 --> 25:10.978
Can't come up with them either, Haskell. I don't 
know why I can't think of that English teacher. I

25:16.505 --> 25:17.907
can see him just as plain. But I was not too good an 
English student either. I passed. In fact, I'll

25:27.332 --> 25:35.383
tell you one teacher I do remember, a history 
teacher named Count Shigariff. Have you ever

25:35.623 --> 25:36.484
heard of him? Yes, I have. Describe him, please. He 
was the funniest guy you ever did see. I was told he

25:42.332 --> 25:50.003
was an escapee from a Red Russian organization of 
some type. And he was comical. And he had a... When

25:57.513 --> 25:59.676
he talked, he rolled his R's. If he called my name, 
it's Mr. Hanover.

26:05.503 --> 26:07.065
And he'd roll it big, you know. And he would 
threaten you. At that time, as you probably know,

26:11.515 --> 26:21.667
the girls who were favorites of A&M were in CIA up in 
Denton, the girls' college. Well, if you couldn't

26:23.188 --> 26:30.777
answer a question correctly, he was going to send 
you to CIA. Would it hurt if I say something here?

26:34.842 --> 26:34.942
No. But remember, the circumstance is going to cut 
your nuts out first.

26:44.168 --> 26:45.670
Now, what history was this? World history or 
American history or European? I guess it was

26:49.036 --> 26:52.782
American history, yeah. And you'd answer 
incorrectly. Where'd you get that answer, Mr.

26:56.728 --> 26:59.453
Hannibal? Got it out of the book. The book's no damn 
good. Throw it out the window. And some of them

27:05.823 --> 27:09.449
throw the damn thing out the window. He's one that 
I'll never forget. I remember one of my civil

27:12.468 --> 27:18.617
engineer teachers named Richie, Cuball Richie, 
they called him. And they called him Cuball

27:20.080 --> 27:26.790
because he always erased the board with his fist 
like that, and then he'd rub it all over his bald

27:20.080 --> 27:26.790
head. So he was called Cuball Richie. And he was 
comical. He would get up and illustrate a stress.

27:39.721 --> 27:43.326
he'd push against the wall till his feet would 
slide on the floor. Or if he was talking about a

27:45.168 --> 27:50.455
beam, he'd run over like this, this beam, and that 
beam. Just comical. So those kinds of people, I

27:53.839 --> 27:57.023
remember them, remember the names. Hey, you went 
to class every day? Every day. Five and a half days.

28:02.671 --> 28:03.672
Yes, yes. On Saturday at the noon. Now, normally 
you left campus about what time at the end of the

28:04.974 --> 28:08.378
day? After five. After five. The workers got off at 
five. And you'd head home, and what chores did you

28:12.367 --> 28:16.912
have to do at home when you got back? Well, had to 
milk those same cows again. They had to be milked

28:20.437 --> 28:24.161
twice a day, seven days a week, you know. I think 
that about the routine when I got home, usually

28:26.384 --> 28:33.032
Mother would have a little snack for us or 
something. And then we'd bring in the wood or

28:33.569 --> 28:38.795
whatever the chores there had to be. Then we'd try 
to get the milking done before dark and then come in

28:38.835 --> 28:44.522
and eat supper. And my routine was after supper I'd 
lie down and sleep 15 minutes. And then I could

28:51.631 --> 28:57.798
study till 10, 10.30, 11 and get up the next morning 
reasonably. What kind of study space did you have

28:58.319 --> 29:00.842
at home? Had a nice living room, but until I was a 
junior, had to study by kerosene lamp. Y'all

29:12.094 --> 29:13.376
didn't have any electricity? No electricity. Did 
you have a telephone? Yeah. It's right around on

29:17.223 --> 29:18.826
the wall around here. What was the phone number? 
Two longs and a short. You were on a party line? On a

29:24.354 --> 29:25.257
party line. About how many were on that party line? 
Twenty or thirty, everybody in the community just

29:29.529 --> 29:32.538
about. And you all lived how far from the paved 
road? Well, they paved the old San Antonio Road in

29:38.183 --> 29:45.681
late 29, I mean in late 30s, late 20s. Your family's 
place was on the OSR? About 1,500 feet back from the

29:48.167 --> 29:52.398
road, but we were on the old San Antonio Road. How 
far to Wheelock? Two miles. And how far to

29:54.964 --> 29:56.327
Franklin? It was 11 miles to Franklin from 
Wheelive.

30:02.993 --> 30:09.500
Then I'd go to bed and, well, take a bath and go to 
bed. And we had running water in the house. My dad

30:15.185 --> 30:21.852
had arranged some years before to have two 
elevated cisterns, he called it, and a windmill.

30:22.993 --> 30:25.656
And when you didn't have any wind, though, we 
didn't have any water. And we arranged a place out

30:26.193 --> 30:37.644
in the garden behind the garage with a sprinkler 
and a hose, and that's where we took our bath out

30:26.193 --> 30:37.644
there, even in pretty cold weather. And the 
temperature of the water was the temperature of

30:37.664 --> 30:41.808
the weather. That's exactly right. Then on 
Sunday, church? Yes. Where'd y'all go? We are.

30:49.015 --> 30:49.996
Which church? Methodist.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.498
The church at Wheat Lock was a union church. One 
Sunday the Baptist preacher, next Sunday the

30:57.460 --> 31:00.908
Methodist. And so the crowd was the same. My mother 
was a devout Baptist, and I was baptized a Baptist.

31:10.368 --> 31:14.577
But when you went to church, you didn't know who was 
what.
