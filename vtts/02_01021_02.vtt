WEBVTT

00:04.891 --> 00:19.414
He suggested, if I ask you this too, that a lot of 
people did pursue law around that time, though,

00:04.891 --> 00:19.414
because they were ineffective in combating the 
legal system through protest and such. Would you

00:19.434 --> 00:20.676
agree with that? Yes. Also, are you a member of any 
radical-type lawyers' guild? I'm a member of the

00:26.930 --> 00:32.438
National Lawyers' Guild and the American Civil 
Lawyers' Union. I cooperate as an attorney

00:32.638 --> 00:36.684
representing people on those cases. In fact, a few 
years ago, the Houston Police Department had a

00:36.744 --> 00:48.562
policy when they arrested someone of placing them 
on hold if they weren't quite sure what charges

00:36.744 --> 00:48.562
they were going to bring. And they would keep 
people on this hold status, which was clearly

00:48.582 --> 00:54.030
unconstitutional sometimes for days. And I've 
wrote a lawsuit. as a cooperating attorney with

00:56.967 --> 01:08.558
the ACLU to stop this practice, to make them, 
within 24 hours, either charge someone or release

00:56.967 --> 01:08.558
them, and was successful in district court and 
federal court. And the policy has since had to

01:08.578 --> 01:13.702
change because of that. I think that the legal, I 
guess I'm involved in a few other types of cases

01:14.583 --> 01:22.471
like that. It's a situation where I think a lot of 
people turned to the legal system. And in law

01:26.899 --> 01:33.645
school, I met a lot of people who were interested in 
doing

01:26.899 --> 01:33.645
that. OK. Getting back to when you were suspended, 
how did that feel? I mean, was there just complete

01:38.930 --> 01:41.993
hostility when they laid down? Well, I was almost 
in a feeling of disbelief. Like, are they really

01:44.835 --> 01:47.418
doing this over this? Are they really suspending 
me for sitting on the grass? It was an incredulous.

01:53.937 --> 01:58.001
a feeling of, I can't believe this is happening. I 
can't believe they're really doing this because I

01:58.381 --> 02:02.825
sat on the grass. That was the initial reaction. 
And how did it feel when you were let back in school

02:06.789 --> 02:13.655
three weeks later? It felt great. I mean, the 
attorney called with the news that the Fifth

02:14.876 --> 02:21.042
Circuit had agreed to let us back in school. It felt 
good, like we'd been vindicated. Or at least,

02:23.810 --> 02:28.295
initially, the courts thought that what we did 
wasn't so terrible. And in fact, they even thought

02:28.355 --> 02:34.461
that we had some likelihood of prevailing on the 
merits. And therefore, they were letting us back

02:34.481 --> 02:37.384
in school to finish. What did your parents think 
when they found out? They were happy I was being

02:40.447 --> 02:42.850
allowed back in school. They were upset. They were 
very upset that I was suspended. They couldn't

02:46.053 --> 02:50.978
understand why I would do anything which would 
lead to a suspension. They also saw it as one of

02:51.633 --> 02:59.345
ruining my career or future or that sort of thing, 
so it was very upsetting to me. Who actually said

02:59.665 --> 03:03.211
you guys were after suspending? The dean of 
students at that time, Floyd Martin, was the

03:03.231 --> 03:14.447
person who came with the rope. The rope was held by 
the football team. Oh gosh! In fact, we had even a

03:18.599 --> 03:28.429
black football player right beside the dean 
holding the rope and telling us that that was it.

03:30.051 --> 03:32.754
Where did everybody else go, these 3,000 people? 
Well, I won't say there weren't 3,000 people at

03:33.294 --> 03:36.077
that point. I'd say there must have been at least 
200 on the grass. But people decided they just

03:39.441 --> 03:42.524
weren't going to get suspended. I mean, if the 
3,000 were, I would say it would be a conservative

03:42.544 --> 03:48.150
estimate of what we had that night after the 
suspension. And where did they meet? It was at the

03:51.601 --> 03:54.986
administration library building, this huge 
area. How did you get them together? That was

03:57.048 --> 03:58.410
almost spontaneous. Was it in anger because of the 
suspension? Yeah, because of the suspension.

04:01.734 --> 04:04.298
They just felt like that had gone too far. And did 
y'all start chants or screaming? There was

04:06.481 --> 04:07.041
chants. There was a lot of screaming. There was a 
lot of chanting. I mean, it was just, it was a lot of

04:09.425 --> 04:12.709
people were very angry. And how come the 
administration didn't come over there and try to

04:12.729 --> 04:15.893
do something else? I don't know. I just, I'm sure at 
that point they couldn't, you know. They probably

04:19.309 --> 04:20.290
got a little scared. Yeah, there was just too many 
people. They just didn't know what was going to

04:21.411 --> 04:24.354
happen. But, you know, on the actual, I mean, one of 
the noticed side here, Dean Martin, who was the one

04:24.374 --> 04:35.246
who read us the suspension letter, was 
subsequently fired from the university for

04:24.374 --> 04:35.246
stealing school funds.

04:37.989 --> 04:44.496
And lost his job sometime in the, I think, late 70s 
or middle 70s. was fired for, you know, stealing

04:45.438 --> 04:48.961
monies. What were you thinking, though, when you 
were just sitting there on that grass, and there

04:49.782 --> 04:54.907
was just nine of you all there, and that's it, and 
here they come? What was going through your head?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.270
Well, of course, when they first came, it was still 
Phil. And then when the dean read the letter

04:59.892 --> 05:06.178
saying, you've got three minutes to leave or you 
will be suspended, then a lot of people left. But I

05:06.218 --> 05:12.964
had decided that I was not doing anything illegal, 
anything in violation of the law. that I was

05:13.417 --> 05:17.824
exercising my constitutional right to free 
speech. And I wasn't stopping or blocking

05:17.844 --> 05:21.289
anyone's path. I wasn't doing anything like that. 
And I couldn't believe that they'd really be doing

05:23.413 --> 05:25.957
this now. My feeling is they're wrong, and I'm not 
going to let them get away with this. I'm not going

05:33.108 --> 05:38.817
to let you get away with violating my rights. And 
that was the feeling. I've got a right to be doing

05:41.001 --> 05:45.985
this, and you're not going to stop me. Were there 
any blacks in your little group? There were some

05:48.767 --> 05:54.132
blacks in the demonstration, but the blacks at 
that time had their own organization. And I think

05:54.913 --> 06:00.037
they were somewhat suspicious of the student 
mobilization committee. It was predominantly

06:00.057 --> 06:05.962
white, and there was still a lot of uneasiness in 
that, and a lot of them had not joined it. Your

06:06.582 --> 06:09.765
group, did they ever organize march in support of 
civil rights? Well, at that point, that never came

06:13.778 --> 06:16.662
up as an issue. I mean, it wasn't a point at which 
some black student or black professor had been and

06:16.882 --> 06:25.114
had his rights violated or something. None of 
those issues ever arose. The issue of this foreign

06:27.838 --> 06:33.566
student came up, that he was Persian. But the 
blacks seemed not to be very politically involved

06:35.228 --> 06:40.275
from the standpoint uh, demonstration or 
protest. They, most of the blacks seemed very much

06:43.807 --> 06:51.455
interested in making it or advancing in the 
system, scoring brownie points with the

06:43.807 --> 06:51.455
administration. And so even their political 
organization was very limited in what it would do

06:52.176 --> 07:00.625
to challenge the administration or protest. You 
mentioned, uh, threats and such. Did those come

07:03.669 --> 07:09.655
after the second moratorium, after the first one, 
were reinstated in school? They came, the threats

07:09.736 --> 07:19.686
came even before the first moratorium, but after 
the first they became more pronounced, and

07:09.736 --> 07:19.686
certainly after the second it was. Although they 
were just mainly threats from people passing cars

07:20.467 --> 07:29.437
or things like that, it was never, you know, I was 
never beaten up. At one point I was almost hit by a

07:29.497 --> 07:35.423
car, but seeing cars seem to be the way they like to 
do things in. Never really had a, I had some

07:36.550 --> 07:48.124
confrontations where people would be trying to 
dare me to say if I'd do something or block my path on

07:36.550 --> 07:48.124
the street, but nothing more serious than that. 
Ever any phone calls? Yeah, there were phone

07:49.666 --> 07:51.408
calls. What were you going to say? We're going to 
get you. We're going to kill you. Get out of here,

07:54.712 --> 07:56.354
Yankee agitator. Things like that. The great 
thing, though, about the university system at

07:58.257 --> 08:06.507
that point was that if you didn't hang up the phone, 
you could trace the call. I think that probably

08:06.892 --> 08:10.938
discouraged people from making those kind of 
phone calls. Would you ever say anything back to

08:10.958 --> 08:13.783
them that you provoked in any way? No, I wouldn't do 
anything, I wouldn't say anything to them. In any

08:17.789 --> 08:23.477
confrontations, did you ever get to the point 
where you just wanted to provoke someone because

08:17.789 --> 08:23.477
they looked... No, I just knew. I mean, I wanted to, 
but I didn't. That was not the proven course to

08:27.003 --> 08:30.368
take. along a very conservative line with your 
protest. Yeah, as far as basically it was a

08:34.080 --> 08:37.465
nonviolent type approach. And I felt that that was 
the best way to do it. What did you think of the more

08:39.929 --> 08:45.738
violent type approaches, such as draft card 
burning, sit-ins? Well, I thought sit-ins could

08:46.700 --> 08:49.264
at times be effective. But I was aware of what we had 
at Southwest Texas State, that we couldn't give

08:50.185 --> 08:58.819
the police and the administration a chance beat us 
up or arrest us because they would do it. And I just

09:02.898 --> 09:07.422
thought that that was a step that we should not 
take. And when you've been like sitting in New York

09:07.442 --> 09:17.351
or sitting in another large city, the results 
would have been much worse.

09:20.594 --> 09:24.338
Your activism, especially when you got down to 
Southwest, was it an everyday thing? Was it very

09:24.378 --> 09:25.298
intense? Were you watching TV every day looking 
for the death counts or was it just well, I need to

09:29.815 --> 09:31.918
work on this protest coming up. How did you 
approach this? No, I'd say it was fairly intense in

09:32.659 --> 09:39.089
that once we started getting things going, it was 
an almost daily. I mean, almost some part of my day

09:39.930 --> 09:45.017
was spent planning or working with other people. 
It was just almost an everyday thing. And of

09:49.163 --> 09:52.488
course, then your whole social activities were 
less. At some point, you were doing things

09:53.049 --> 09:58.918
relating to the organization or the 
demonstration. Oh, I see. What did you think of

10:01.169 --> 10:05.414
Nixon and LBJ then? Well, you didn't like what 
Nixon said. What did you think of both of those

10:07.696 --> 10:12.081
presidents back then and how you feel about them 
now? Well, of LBJ, I thought that initially, you

10:13.383 --> 10:26.017
know, he was really concerned about social policy 
and really was trying to make a good attempt to

10:13.383 --> 10:26.017
improve the economic conditions in the country. I 
think where he got sidetracked was thinking he

10:26.838 --> 10:30.822
could be both, you know, fight a war I thought he was 
not properly informed by advisors, by

10:31.443 --> 10:42.377
intelligence estimates, of what was really 
happening in South Vietnam. And I think the

10:42.397 --> 10:57.998
decisions he made were just tragic, because I 
think had he chosen to back out of Vietnam,

10:42.397 --> 10:57.998
the economic condition of the country could have 
greatly improved. Unfortunately, he did not.

11:01.312 --> 11:15.666
Yeah, I think that LBJ, I see him as being more of a 
person with genuine concern about people in the

11:01.312 --> 11:15.666
country, as opposed to Nixon that I see as being 
extremely cold and calculated. Although I think

11:15.686 --> 11:27.757
LBJ, once he realized what had happened, he didn't 
have the courage to say, look, I've been wrong,

11:15.686 --> 11:27.757
which he could have done in 66 or 67 and just changed 
things around. By the time the Tet Offensive, it

11:28.878 --> 11:30.880
was too late. And then he had to withdraw from the 
candidacy. But I think he didn't have the courage

11:36.547 --> 11:44.619
to really, in 66 or 67, just back out and change the 
policy. I think he had gotten so involved in it that

11:44.639 --> 11:49.966
he couldn't do a turnaround, as he should have. And 
it would have saved many lives and many problems

11:50.747 --> 11:57.497
that the country faced over the next several 
years. What about Mr. Netzer? I see him, I mean, you

12:00.070 --> 12:04.517
know, the term tricky dick just sums it all up. I 
mean, he's just a person who's very cold, very

12:04.537 --> 12:18.638
calculating, a person who essentially was 
elected as someone who would probably end the war

12:04.537 --> 12:18.638
or be better equipped to end the war. He campaigned 
in 68, and I've got this secret plan in my pocket,

12:18.658 --> 12:27.090
you know, I'll end this war, and then proceeded to 
escalate.

12:30.192 --> 12:36.960
The thing is, he was just always a rabid 
anti-communist, always saw things in terms of

12:30.192 --> 12:36.960
communist versus anti-communist. And I think he 
was a terrible leader for our country at that time

12:36.980 --> 12:43.367
because of that fact. I mean, he was basically 
schooled in the 40s or late 40s type of containment

12:43.387 --> 12:51.196
communism. I don't think that the man had the 
ability to really lead

12:52.317 --> 12:59.305
the country. He was also very paranoid. He saw 
every protest as someone who hated him. It was a

13:05.861 --> 13:09.846
personal attack against him, because they were 
protesting his policies. And you can't lead a

13:10.607 --> 13:16.035
nation with that kind of attitude, that kind of 
outlook. And for that reason, I just found him

13:16.956 --> 13:18.958
repulsive. And then, of course, he was a late 
alert. He was also very crooked. How'd you feel

13:24.606 --> 13:26.408
about that, the Watergate? Well, I thought. You 
know, it was to be expected. I wasn't surprised by

13:29.974 --> 13:31.756
what he had done. I was surprised that he finally 
got caught. But I wasn't surprised by what he had

13:34.540 --> 13:37.503
done. How did you feel with the invasion of 
Cambodia in 1970? That, to me, was just

13:42.931 --> 13:44.653
outrageous. I mean, I just, what I feared was that 
we'd be drawn into an even bigger war. That instead

13:49.659 --> 13:55.627
of learning from what had been happening in the 
last several years in Vietnam, we were ignoring

13:49.659 --> 13:55.627
it. And taking this, to me, imbecilic approach of, 
well, we just conquer all of Southeast Asia. The

14:02.847 --> 14:10.897
way to, we were still trying to win the war and 
thinking, well, if we just did more bombing, more

14:02.847 --> 14:10.897
weapons, somehow we'd win. And to me, it was 
ludicrous. Do you think that stems from the fact

14:13.119 --> 14:15.402
that they'd always won? Yeah. I think 
particularly Nixon was of this idea, America

14:16.603 --> 14:20.949
always wins a war. And we'll do, obviously, we're 
not winning. So rather than back out or just

14:24.433 --> 14:28.017
realize this is not We had no business being here. I 
mean, no one, neither Johnson nor Nixon, could

14:29.913 --> 14:35.061
ever admit, it was a mistake to be here. Let's just 
get out. We had to win. And so you had Nixon's

14:38.847 --> 14:44.055
bombings and his ludicrous activities. When you 
went back to City College in 1970, did you continue

14:45.597 --> 14:50.886
your career? Yeah, I was involved in some anti-war 
activities. Although, at that point, I guess, It

14:57.292 --> 15:05.983
was a matter of being somewhat involved, but it 
wasn't the same, because there were lots of people

14:57.292 --> 15:05.983
involved in organizing activities. There were 
always people willing to do things. It wasn't like

15:08.907 --> 15:15.676
Southwest, where there wasn't someone to take on 
the leadership. So you kind of sat back and

15:15.696 --> 15:17.659
participated. I participated, but did not assume 
any, you know, was involved in some any war

15:17.679 --> 15:26.050
activities in organizing or participating in the 
organization of some. Not to the extent that I did

15:26.468 --> 15:28.511
in San Marcos. The students there at City College, 
were they aware of what you had done at Southwell?

15:34.039 --> 15:37.183
Some were that I'd talked to, but I mean, nothing. I 
mean, it was not. I mean, the thing was, the kind of

15:38.906 --> 15:42.491
reaction was to me, they suspended you for that. 
Just a look of disbelief.

15:48.779 --> 15:54.147
When you were protesting and such, when you were 
organizing those groups of people to stand out

15:48.779 --> 15:54.147
against the war, Did that give you any kind of sense 
of power? And also, did you feel like you were

15:57.563 --> 16:01.308
accomplishing anything? Well, I certainly felt 
like we were accomplishing something, that we

16:01.328 --> 16:19.852
were letting the community, the university, and 
hopefully the decision makers or policymakers in

16:01.328 --> 16:19.852
government realize that there was a significant 
sector that disagreed and disapproved their

16:01.328 --> 16:19.852
policies. I mean, there was a sense of power in the 
sense of getting people to organize or people to

16:24.586 --> 16:33.677
orchestrate this same belief that you had, this 
massive outpouring of feelings. But I think it was

16:35.280 --> 16:52.281
less a feeling of power and more a feeling of 
accomplishment that we were getting a message

16:35.280 --> 16:52.281
across, or at least trying to, and at least having 
it heard or having a number of people show up to

16:35.280 --> 16:52.281
express the same Did you say it was fun what you were 
doing, or was it more serious business? It was

16:57.846 --> 16:59.288
serious. I never felt like it was really fun. I 
mean, sometimes it was a sense of satisfaction. A

17:04.834 --> 17:06.777
lot of times, a sense of frustration.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.081
Never quite fun.

17:13.185 --> 17:16.549
Fun then was jumping out of airplanes. It still is. 
But it wouldn't really say fun. a sense of

17:21.539 --> 17:25.383
satisfaction at times. How did you, you had the S2 
college deferment, but after you, did you just

17:25.403 --> 17:34.092
continue with that when you went to law school? No, 
what happened was they instituted the lottery

17:34.292 --> 17:50.348
system in December of 70, or December of 69, and my 
number, while not being very high, by the time I

17:34.292 --> 17:50.348
finished, or the time my 2S deferment ran out, 
which was in 71, they were not reaching my number,

17:52.066 --> 17:55.449
is basically what it came down to. If you had been 
drafted, would you have gone? No. I would have

18:00.534 --> 18:06.761
applied for a conscientious objector status, and 
if not, would have refused. Fortunately, I didn't

18:07.682 --> 18:14.989
have to come to that point, but I couldn't see 
myself going in the military. What did you think of

18:15.009 --> 18:18.572
the people who did conform and get? Well, it's kind 
of hard to judge them. What distressed me was not so

18:23.082 --> 18:30.894
much the people who believed in what the 
government was doing and going, but the people who

18:23.082 --> 18:30.894
didn't want to go but went anyway. I suppose I had 
less respect for them and felt that if everyone who

18:32.997 --> 18:44.194
had reservations about the Vietnam War would just 
speak out and refuse to go, they wouldn't have an

18:32.997 --> 18:44.194
army over there. And that's what was distressing 
the people who just felt like, well, I've got to do

18:44.214 --> 18:51.064
this, even though I don't want to, even though I 
don't believe in what I'm doing. And so we had a lot

18:52.023 --> 18:59.292
of people in Vietnam who didn't want to be there, 
didn't believe in what they were doing. And that

18:59.653 --> 19:07.303
was distressing to me, that people would just go 
ahead and be pushed into that and allow themselves

18:59.653 --> 19:07.303
to be put in that situation. I mean, I can 
intellectually understand why and what they were

19:07.764 --> 19:14.452
doing, but emotionally it was very upsetting. 
Well, how did you feel when the troops were drawn? I

19:18.357 --> 19:19.379
felt good about that. I thought that was, 
unfortunately, just too late. I mean, it was

19:23.230 --> 19:32.483
satisfying that the government was finally doing 
it, but what seemed so sad was that the government

19:23.230 --> 19:32.483
didn't do it 10 years earlier. Did you lose any 
friends? I had one or two friends from my

19:34.626 --> 19:41.256
neighborhood in Brooklyn who were injured or 
killed in Vietnam. How did you feel about that?

19:43.259 --> 19:44.761
That was very upsetting. Very, very upsetting. 
Realizing it could be me or just the situation that

19:46.203 --> 19:51.190
it was all so needless. Was your father in the 
service at all? Yeah, he was in the Army, too. Was

19:54.827 --> 19:55.127
he? Did he see any acts of him? Some in the Pacific.

20:01.857 --> 20:05.763
Did you ever have any confrontations with him 
about your opinions? No, I think my father, I

20:06.044 --> 20:20.265
think, and the, I guess after this happened, he had 
some understanding that I think he was beginning

20:06.044 --> 20:20.265
to, I think like a lot of adults or some adults, in 
the question of what we were doing there, that this

20:20.549 --> 20:27.619
was a war that was just going on and on and on, and 
nothing was really happening. And especially

20:28.580 --> 20:32.005
after the Tet Offensive, people began to say, why 
are we still there? So we never had any real

20:32.666 --> 20:41.499
confrontations, but I think he began to 
understand my

20:32.666 --> 20:41.499
feelings. In the demonstrations, the people that 
participated, they were mainly students, but you

20:41.519 --> 20:50.151
mentioned that some faculty and community 
members participated. Did the administrators

20:50.502 --> 20:58.954
ever try to get anyone to speak, or was that just 
your thing, trying to get the faculty to speak? The

20:58.974 --> 21:02.599
administration, did they ever offer to get people 
to speak? No, they would have nothing to do with it.

21:06.204 --> 21:10.269
And the community people, were they just business 
people? Yeah, they were pretty much just business

21:10.290 --> 21:15.196
people who did not want to get involved. The 
professors who spoke subsequently, some of them

21:15.296 --> 21:20.003
lost their jobs, except for the tenured ones. But

21:20.337 --> 21:28.810
everyone who spoke who did not have tenure was 
subsequently lost. And some professors I

21:28.830 --> 21:32.957
approached would not speak for fear of a process.

21:35.521 --> 21:42.712
You mentioned in the interview you had a 
confrontation in a demonstration in May of 1970.

21:42.732 --> 21:45.837
Is that at the vigil or is that something else? That 
wasn't at the vigil. The day of the vigil, which we

21:47.877 --> 21:57.711
had,

21:47.877 --> 21:57.711
we were going to lower the American flag, is what we 
had planned to do. And we surrounded the flag by the

21:57.731 --> 22:02.958
Evans Academic Center. And we're going to lower it 
to half-staff, or half-mast. But then decided not

22:07.385 --> 22:08.746
to. And instead, because what happened was the 
administration just sent down a lot of the cowboys

22:08.787 --> 22:16.197
to surround us. And it looked like there was going 
to be a bloodbath or a fairly violent

22:16.480 --> 22:21.227
confrontation. So at that point, we just sang a 
patriotic song and then invited anyone to

22:21.267 --> 22:30.279
discuss. And there was a discussion that went on 
for about two hours between people. Who started

22:36.007 --> 22:37.269
singing? It was my idea at that point. Really? 
Because I realized they were looking for blood,

22:39.772 --> 22:43.798
and the administration was just going to look the 
other way. Yeah. I mean, they were clear. one of the

22:46.180 --> 22:49.464
people in our group had a wire cutter that was going 
to lower the flag. And I realized that if he did

22:50.165 --> 22:54.771
that, that would have just been violence. Uh-huh.

23:04.124 --> 23:08.169
And you said there were no arrests there because of 
the nonviolent activity? That's right, there

23:08.189 --> 23:12.515
were

23:08.189 --> 23:12.515
not any. That covers about everything that I 
wanted to to dig into. Is there anything else that

23:17.905 --> 23:25.955
you feel needs to be added in the statement you'd 
like to make? Let

23:25.975 --> 23:31.142
me ask you this. What do you think about our 
situation in Nicaragua right now? I think it's a

23:35.307 --> 23:38.291
situation where we have no business being there. I 
think we ought to let the whatever rebels in the

23:38.311 --> 23:45.820
government fight it out if if that's what's going 
to be done there. We should not, I just, I don't

23:48.344 --> 24:00.738
think we should be involved in supporting, it's 
just as wrong for us to be there supporting someone

23:48.344 --> 24:00.738
we like as it would be for us to be supporting 
someone we didn't like. Or to be, it's wrong for us

24:01.478 --> 24:11.269
to criticize Russia for supplying weapons and 
supplies to one side as it is for us to be in there. I

24:11.950 --> 24:15.013
mean, the government has always had this attitude 
that, If the regime is pro-American, then it's

24:15.365 --> 24:21.311
okay for us to support them. And I just find that 
difficult. I don't agree with it. And I still have a

24:27.217 --> 24:38.429
lot of problems with the government's policies, 
but I think that certainly after the Vietnam War,

24:27.217 --> 24:38.429
there seems to be, it's more acceptable for people 
to speak out, to organize, to protest. I think the

24:39.070 --> 24:44.275
civil rights demonstrations of the early 60s, 
which was a forerunner of the late 60s, But the

24:45.115 --> 24:59.054
difference was that you had large amounts of white 
youth involved in the 60s that you really did not in

24:45.115 --> 24:59.054
the early 60s in civil rights demonstrations.

25:00.255 --> 25:03.820
I think people now accept that you can have 
demonstrations, you can protest. I mean, back

25:04.902 --> 25:12.692
then, if you can imagine, it was very unusual, 
especially in San Marcos or a lot of smaller

25:04.902 --> 25:12.692
cities. In Texas, in the South? I'd say in the South 
and the Midwest. It was very unusual. I mean, we've

25:19.797 --> 25:23.283
become really conditioned to protest the 
demonstrations. But in the late 60s, that was

25:23.383 --> 25:29.973
still something new, something unusual.

25:32.096 --> 25:41.110
So I think that that's one benefit overall that's 
come out of that period, is that demonstrations

25:32.096 --> 25:41.110
and protests are acceptable. just for civil 
rights demonstrations. They're there for

25:43.272 --> 25:47.757
everybody with some sort of grievance or some sort 
of complaint about the government. It's just more

25:48.458 --> 25:50.220
acceptable to do that. I mean, back at that time, 
the middle to late 60s, that was not acceptable. I

25:56.307 --> 25:59.590
mean, again, it was akin to being unpatriotic or 
seditious. And that whole attitude has

26:00.852 --> 26:04.636
completely changed. OK. Is there anything else 
you'd like to add? No, I think that's enough.

26:08.621 --> 26:09.962
That's plenty, believe me. OK. One of my.
