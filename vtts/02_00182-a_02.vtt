WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:28.857
president walton very good uh i'm trying to recall 
i don't remember the president being very close to

00:02.579 --> 00:28.857
the student body at that time we were there was a 
buffer i guess you could say the military of course

00:02.579 --> 00:28.857
i didn't mention them previously but they played a 
big role in uh the core life and sort of

00:29.275 --> 00:35.851
administered the core at that time. So you didn't 
see President Walton, your students didn't much?

00:40.402 --> 00:42.387
No, no. I remember one incident that...

00:48.580 --> 01:02.333
I can't recall the exact details, but I was at a 
meeting one evening with a group of students of

00:48.580 --> 01:02.333
some type, I don't know, agricultural students 
maybe, that met with him, and he talked to us, and I

00:48.580 --> 01:02.333
was really impressed. He was an excellent 
speaker, I thought, and seemed to have good

01:02.393 --> 01:16.647
understanding of the institution, and my 
impression at that age was very good, and I

01:16.930 --> 01:23.997
remember Earl Rutter saying when he was a student 
here, they referred to the president as the Prexy.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.559
Was that still common when you got here? I believe 
that's right. And there was a light up on top of the

01:29.062 --> 01:41.634
academic building, a light globe that they called 
Prexy's Moon, and he said that you would try to

01:29.062 --> 01:41.634
shoot it out with your core rifle. I recall that now 
that you mention it. I don't remember... anyone in

01:46.293 --> 01:53.441
our area trying to do the shooting that I recall, 
but that was part of it. Just had another thought,

01:55.704 --> 02:00.189
but it's already slipped my mind. Well, you know, 
Dr. Walton was removed from the presidency

02:01.250 --> 02:11.121
shortly after I was here as a student. I think it was 
during the war, perhaps, early 40s. I'm I'm sure

02:16.516 --> 02:20.020
you know the time on it. I heard this story at the 
time after he had been removed. You know he became

02:26.348 --> 02:30.353
postmaster at College Station. You may have heard 
this. He lived on the south side of the campus and

02:34.217 --> 02:37.661
he'd always drive around the campus. He never 
would go through the campus anymore after he'd

02:37.701 --> 02:45.831
been let out as president and was now postmaster. 
Those two undergraduate years, what did you and

02:46.722 --> 02:56.057
your friends do for a good time at Texas A&M on, say, 
a Saturday night? Leave town, if possible. And how

03:00.725 --> 03:03.649
did you get to Houston when you left town? Catch 
rides. The highway would be full starting Friday

03:05.452 --> 03:13.185
after 1 o'clock. You heard the old story, saw I'm 
sure about, had a court trip to hell, we'd want to

03:14.363 --> 03:19.830
leave early. And normally how long did it take you 
hitchhiking to Houston? That depends. If you were

03:28.081 --> 03:31.645
fortunate, two and a half hours. It could take five 
or six. And going, coming back sometimes is even

03:34.248 --> 03:40.236
worse because there's always a question, where do 
you go in Houston to catch a ride back. Where was the

03:43.801 --> 03:46.909
best place to catch a ride in Houston? Well, we 
usually got out on Hampstead Highway there off

03:46.929 --> 03:56.655
19th

03:46.929 --> 03:56.655
Street used to run out. Hempstead Highway, and of 
course, I was still going home at the time, and my

03:57.074 --> 04:08.145
parents lived in the Heights, which was fairly 
near to that particular location. And if you

04:08.826 --> 04:13.391
caught a ride there, you're bound to get almost to 
get to Hempstead at least. And you would

04:15.333 --> 04:19.117
certainly, coming back, you would certainly wear 
your uniform. Oh, yes. That was a key item to

04:19.838 --> 04:21.840
getting around? Absolutely. Well, you'd have it 
on actually then. And we'd go to Dallas-Fort

04:26.437 --> 04:31.184
Worth. Also, you talk about entertainment and so 
forth, it's fairly common to go to Denton to what

04:32.146 --> 04:42.081
was then TSCW, I believe it was called. And I've 
been up there a fair number of weekends along with a

04:42.862 --> 04:51.596
lot of other Aggies. Do you have any hitchhiking 
anecdotes

05:01.098 --> 05:03.661
None come to mind just immediately. No.

05:08.326 --> 05:11.430
Did you ever have any bad experience hitchhiking? 
No. I never. I never interviewed a single person

05:14.694 --> 05:16.936
who did. Well, the uniform was great, and I don't 
remember a specific anecdote, but the people

05:16.956 --> 05:24.385
would pick you up. You were just friends right away 
and have a conversation with them. They were.

05:28.587 --> 05:32.932
happy to pick you up and take you wherever you were. 
If you were not going to leave town, what did you and

05:32.952 --> 05:37.697
your friends do for a good time? Well, there were 
dances in the spring that we would go to

05:39.239 --> 05:53.596
intermittently, and there's a place called 
Hardlickers out here, I guess you've heard of it,

05:39.239 --> 05:53.596
that was south of the campus. It was a refuge if you 
didn't have anything else to do. Now, Mr.

05:57.798 --> 06:00.461
Hardlaker served what kind of beverages?

06:03.144 --> 06:08.151
I believe beer was the only alcoholic beverage 
allowed at that time. Of course, he had all the soft

06:08.191 --> 06:13.817
drinks, and I believe they even served a little 
food out there. Was there a careful check on the age

06:15.860 --> 06:21.947
of anyone buying a beer at Mr. Hardlaker's? I can 
never remember any. And do you remember Aggies

06:25.675 --> 06:31.803
getting drunk much?

06:31.823 --> 06:33.946
Well, I can certainly remember it, yes.

06:36.669 --> 06:40.534
There wasn't much restraint on drinking. It 
didn't seem to me. But whiskey was a rare

06:45.500 --> 06:49.866
commodity, wasn't it? Because this was a dry 
county for whiskey. Yes, but I... I wouldn't call

06:54.802 --> 06:56.084
it rare. Oh, really? It depended on the situation. 
Like if there were special weekends or events,

07:00.069 --> 07:08.441
there'd be some around. Would they have brought 
that from home? To some extent, although there

07:12.106 --> 07:18.455
were two or three liquor stores right across the 
river that made a fortune, I suppose. Did you all

07:18.575 --> 07:20.438
call it Whiskey Bridge then? I believe so. I was 
trying to think just what the reference was to that

07:22.109 --> 07:35.985
location, but I believe there's a store right 
across the Brazzers where 60 is and also out on 21.

07:36.345 --> 07:42.492
The

07:36.345 --> 07:42.492
young ladies came for these dances. How were those 
young women treated at an Aggie dance? With

07:48.734 --> 07:51.138
respect, I would say, yes. And

07:52.139 --> 08:09.986
I've had girls up for the dances, and not as many as 
some of the students would have one every weekend

07:52.139 --> 08:09.986
they'd have a dance if they were going steady with 
some girl from Austin or TSCW or Houston or Dallas.

08:10.948 --> 08:15.354
And the girls usually stayed in local homes 
around. In fact, well, this is getting ahead, but

08:18.147 --> 08:26.621
Later on, we had a home south of college where we 
kept girls nearly every weekend in the spring.

08:29.626 --> 08:32.911
Many of the faculty lived on campus in that era. 
That is correct. So there was a true community

08:34.774 --> 08:44.290
there on the campus of family and students and so 
forth. like I've heard the two Cashin boys

08:45.164 --> 08:53.677
describe their experiences growing up on the 
campus.

08:54.318 --> 08:58.404
Where was there near the campus that you could walk 
to buy something? Northgate. What was that

09:00.587 --> 09:05.174
described Northgate in that era? Two drugstores 
is the main thing I remember. One was Lipscomb's

09:08.960 --> 09:12.285
Drugstore, and it would have been on... northwest 
corner and uh i believe they call the other one the

09:13.750 --> 09:35.387
aggie land pharmacy on the right corner and then 
there was hollick's boot store and uh cleaners

09:13.750 --> 09:35.387
down the the college avenue part there and i 
believe walter had a store there at the north gate

09:36.312 --> 09:40.698
And a jeweler, I think, and just three or four. Was 
the campus theater open in those days?

09:47.106 --> 09:49.069
I don't believe so by 38. Oh, yes, that's something 
I should have known. We went in the assembly hall,

09:54.716 --> 09:59.742
and it was a wooden building. I think they said it 
was built during World War I, right after World War

10:00.383 --> 10:05.610
I in that period. uh... fire hazard if there ever 
was one just totally would and i think smoking was

10:06.282 --> 10:35.192
prohibited in it uh... but it was a real danger and i 
guess it wasn't torn down until the current chapel

10:06.282 --> 10:35.192
was built which i guess was soon after world war two 
but at entertainment we went to shows a lot they

10:06.282 --> 10:35.192
were just i think they just had them saturdays and 
maybe sundays and Maybe Wednesday night, I've

10:35.476 --> 10:37.118
forgotten. But you'd usually go to one or two shows 
a week. Do you have some memories you can share of

10:42.066 --> 10:46.492
some Aggie good bull? Some pranks, some jokes?

10:52.220 --> 10:55.365
Well, I'm hard-pressed right at the moment. That 
airing out thing was an experience. I thought that

10:58.449 --> 11:03.036
justified telling.

11:05.817 --> 11:07.799
Oh, yes, thank you. I couldn't think of that term 
while ago. Yes, in the spring particularly as it

11:10.262 --> 11:34.390
began to warm up a little, there was a lot of 
drowning out and I don't recall just what

11:10.262 --> 11:34.390
different occasions were used as somewhat of an 
excuse or a reason to do this, but that was kind of a

11:10.262 --> 11:34.390
challenge and as I recall, it usually started 
drowning out the fish and then then they'd be

11:35.112 --> 11:39.396
instructed to go drown out Mr. So-and-so or this 
one or another. And that was one way some of the

11:39.416 --> 11:45.621
cadets got even with some of the others they didn't 
think so much of. But that went on quite a lot in the

11:45.681 --> 11:51.867
spring months. And to get started, there was just 
no end to it. The whole battery would be drowned

11:55.350 --> 11:58.112
out. Did anybody ever attempt any pranks on a 
faculty member or a staff member?

12:08.643 --> 12:16.716
I can't honestly recall any

12:08.643 --> 12:16.716
in class or out.

12:20.623 --> 12:30.499
I don't know if this is an anecdote or not, but one of 
the faculty members I do recall being somewhat

12:20.623 --> 12:30.499
eccentric was Dr. Humbert. Eugene Humbert in the 
genetics department, and he had several

12:31.863 --> 12:42.316
requirements of his students, and actually he 
didn't. He was not the best teacher in a strict

12:43.678 --> 12:56.554
sense, but he was strict and did insist you read 
your lesson, but he required you to bring your book

12:43.678 --> 12:56.554
to class, and you had to wear Socks rolled up so that 
your socks reached your trousers.

13:04.920 --> 13:05.341
I've forgotten. He had one or two other little 
quirks that he insisted on, and I recall one

13:05.361 --> 13:15.979
incident during the semester when something 
upset him a little. Anyway, he got a little mad

13:16.039 --> 13:19.825
about something, and he said, All right. How many 
people brought their books to class today? There

13:22.511 --> 13:23.852
were about three kids. All right, the rest of you 
can go home. And he just emptied the old classroom

13:27.276 --> 13:30.640
right there. But he would do that, that sort of 
thing. As far as you recall, what was the typical

13:35.665 --> 13:45.336
attitude of the A&M student body then about going 
to class?

13:48.139 --> 13:49.761
Did you all go to class regularly?

13:52.981 --> 13:54.743
Freshmen did. They had to be punished if they 
didn't, if somebody found it out. My recollection

14:03.273 --> 14:08.659
is the higher up you went in school, the less 
concerned you were about going to class. I can

14:09.420 --> 14:11.702
always remember the architect students. We had 
several of them in our battery, and our captain was

14:11.722 --> 14:15.006
an architect. student I bet I was in school two 
months before I ever saw him they'd go up there

14:15.728 --> 14:27.105
after dinner at night about seven or eight o'clock 
and stayed till two or three or I don't know. They

14:32.517 --> 14:35.161
were up there all night. And man, they wouldn't get 
up till noon. That's true. I didn't even know. They

14:41.229 --> 14:45.215
kept saying, well, Captain, I think his name was 
J.W. Floor, was the battery commander. I never had

14:49.321 --> 14:50.783
seen the fella. And when I finally saw him, I didn't 
know who he was. But that was one unusual element of

14:54.710 --> 15:01.438
the class situation or attendance situation. I'd 
say the juniors and seniors, I'd say, were less

15:01.458 --> 15:14.713
committed to going to class consistently, but 
freshmen sure attended. Coming from a minister's

15:15.594 --> 15:22.101
family, you should be able to describe the 
religious activities at A&M at that period.

15:25.253 --> 15:29.941
I almost started to say slamming none, but it's 
been unfair. No, that's really not correct. There

15:36.372 --> 15:43.043
was not a lot of organized religious activity day 
to day and week to week. There were the local

15:43.681 --> 16:01.304
churches available, and I did go along with some of 
the other students to the Presbyterian Church,

15:43.681 --> 16:01.304
and we would have a meeting Sunday nights that 
Reverend Anderson conducted. Describe that

16:01.544 --> 16:07.952
congregation during those years, and who were 
some of the notable members? You're talking about

16:07.992 --> 16:10.836
the church congregation.

16:12.571 --> 16:34.868
It was small, I'd say, ordinary attendance, and we 
met in, the Presbyterian congregation met in the

16:12.571 --> 16:34.868
Y, YMCA, and I guess there were probably 100 to 150 
probably in attendance, and that's about all the

16:12.571 --> 16:34.868
chapel there would hold, and mostly local people. 
There'd be I guess the student attendance varied

16:36.145 --> 16:43.498
from I'm going to say 20 to 40, something like that, 
the regular services. There were quite a few of the

16:43.979 --> 16:50.751
faculty that attended the preb here in church that 
you'd know. Bolton was one of them, Dean Bolton.

16:53.662 --> 16:56.869
and D.W. Williams, who was quite prominent. And, 
let's see, I guess he'd become, he was Chancellor

16:57.551 --> 17:04.287
of Agriculture, I remember, I don't, I remember 
just how. Cashians. And the Cashians, of course,

17:05.429 --> 17:08.015
yeah, certainly. And, um, Then there were some 
department heads. Guy Adrian, are you familiar

17:13.929 --> 17:15.831
with him? He was head of horticulture. Ross 
Sherwood, he was in the experiment station in the

17:18.253 --> 17:25.320
animal science area.

17:28.984 --> 17:33.528
President Morgan also attended there when he was, 
well, that's later on. Describe Brother Anderson

17:34.389 --> 17:38.653
as the minister. describe him in personality

17:39.292 --> 17:44.818
and so forth and style? He was a Scotchman and quite 
definite in his concepts and statements and

17:44.838 --> 18:04.160
he was I'd say conscientious and committed to his 
role as a minister. His

18:10.477 --> 18:24.617
of appeal was perhaps not as great as one might 
expect

18:10.477 --> 18:24.617
from a student standpoint of the type of 
individual that would appeal most to students at

18:10.477 --> 18:24.617
that age.

18:28.122 --> 18:31.987
Colonel Anderson was also a member of that 
company, wasn't he? He sure was. Thank you. These

18:35.352 --> 18:36.574
names just don't come up. If you can jog my memory, 
it helps. Yes, he and his wife, Helen Anderson, who

18:40.312 --> 18:46.922
was quite a delightful lady, were members. And I 
always remember and have high regard for Colonel,

18:47.363 --> 18:55.335
we called him Colonel Andy at the time. He was the 
commandant just for a couple of years, as I recall.

19:01.886 --> 19:05.391
But one of the years that I was an undergraduate 
here, And I have forgotten the incident, but these

19:06.653 --> 19:22.129
kind of things used to occur, not constantly, but 
occasionally if some disagreement or the Corps

19:06.653 --> 19:22.129
got upset about something, they didn't march on 
the house like they did with Gilchrist later. But

19:22.209 --> 19:29.116
anyway, Colonel Landy was commandant, and he was 
on the other side of the argument with the Corps.

19:30.097 --> 19:34.922
And he was, I thought, treated unreasonably.

19:36.607 --> 19:52.045
He'd come out there during this particular 
period, I recall, come out and stand in the center

19:36.607 --> 19:52.045
of the campus there as the representation of 
authority, and he was either booed or mistreated.

19:53.106 --> 19:55.609
He just happened to be on the other side. He was 
insisting on probably some adherence to some

19:55.669 --> 20:04.960
regulation or rule, and the cadets, of course, 
weren't always too enthused about that. But I

20:05.362 --> 20:12.970
think he was generally well-liked, but he did get 
crossways with his students sometimes. You all

20:14.211 --> 20:18.115
had a Presbyterian Sunday night activity. Right. 
Was there also a worship service on Sunday night?

20:24.261 --> 20:25.823
No, I don't recall there being. Oh, one thing I 
wanted to include about the religious part that

20:25.883 --> 20:31.048
I'd overlooked that did illustrate, demonstrate 
the interest of the institution in religious

20:32.615 --> 20:38.301
activities. And that was the, I've forgotten the 
name they had for it, but it was a week of Christian

20:38.341 --> 20:46.309
ministry. Religious emphasis week. RE week, 
yeah. And each

20:50.433 --> 21:01.744
major denomination would have one of their 
renowned pastors from somewhere in the United

20:50.433 --> 21:01.744
States come. And then there'd be one major speaker 
who would speak to the cadet corps every morning at

21:01.808 --> 21:16.271
10 o'clock, I'll say, in Guyon Hall. And it'd be 
Phil. It really would be. And these were

21:19.356 --> 21:21.279
outstanding people. And if you ask me who one of 
them was, I can remember one. Lewis Evans was here

21:26.206 --> 21:28.310
one time. But I I can't remember the names of the 
others, but it was quite an important event, and I

21:30.277 --> 21:38.945
don't know whether they'd be allowed to do that 
sort of thing nowadays. I'm afraid so, but it

21:41.228 --> 21:51.698
really was a great occasion, and the thing that 
impressed me about it, looking back at that time,

21:41.228 --> 21:51.698
was the students responded. There was good 
attendance, and then at the individual

21:52.158 --> 21:56.082
churches... there would be attendance. As I 
recall, using Presbyterian for example since

21:58.785 --> 22:24.853
that's the one I'm familiar with, we'd have a 
speaker from somewhere large congregation

21:58.785 --> 22:24.853
throughout the country and he would speak each 
night at the local congregation and we'd have both

21:58.785 --> 22:24.853
students and members or the public invited as far 
as that goes. Did y'all go to a Wednesday, was there

22:25.559 --> 22:30.526
a Wednesday night of service? I cannot remember 
that there was. I don't, I remember the evening

22:33.831 --> 22:41.742
services, but I think they're on, just on Sunday 
evenings. Now there might be on occasion special

22:41.962 --> 22:48.511
call meetings, you know, Wednesday night. Do you 
remember going to football games that first year

22:50.394 --> 22:54.840
up here?

22:58.027 --> 23:05.799
Yes, I can't remember a lot of detail about them, 
except we stood up all the time, which I soon

22:58.027 --> 23:05.799
learned that part of it. And I believe I went to most 
of them, and surprisingly I had somewhat mixed

23:06.059 --> 23:16.194
emotions that first year when we played Rice. I 
couldn't quite get over the fact that I almost

23:16.314 --> 23:24.186
favored Rice at the time, having been there for 
some years. And if I recall, that was when Rice had

23:24.655 --> 23:29.101
some pretty good teams along in there. I think they 
went to Cotton Bowl one year along in there, 37 or

23:29.121 --> 23:33.427
38. What about court trips? Did you make court 
trips? Yes.

23:44.162 --> 23:49.850
As I recall, there would be just one or two in the 
fall, though. And I remember one... Well, we

23:52.499 --> 24:11.001
always had a court trip when we played in Austin, 
and I remember going there, and I remember

23:52.499 --> 24:11.001
marching down Congress, whatever avenue we 
marched, and that's about all of it I can remember

23:52.499 --> 24:11.001
at this time. I think we had one in Houston and 
probably one in Dallas during that period of time.

24:19.150 --> 24:21.713
Do you remember going to Silver Taps? What 
impression did that make?

24:27.716 --> 24:28.998
I thought it was a great tradition. It surely did. 
And very moving and impressive. It had an impact on

24:35.946 --> 24:39.010
the core, on the students, I believe. What about 
Bonfire in that era?

24:48.575 --> 24:54.223
Well, I can't separate it from 60 years of Bonfire 
very well. Well, I haven't been here all that time,

24:56.066 --> 25:03.217
but I can recall Bonfire, but I'm almost certain it 
was after I graduated. A number of people have told

25:03.898 --> 25:12.270
me that before World War II, it was primarily a 
collection of rubbish, trash. Oh, that part. I

25:13.071 --> 25:15.595
think about the occasion itself. it was nothing 
like these monumental things that are built now

25:16.402 --> 25:26.642
and, uh, would have, would just be a big, big 
bonfire. That's about all you could say of it. Not

25:28.145 --> 25:31.752
a, I certainly don't. Uh, I'm not sure that I did. 
Uh, But it was, you know, you didn't have to

25:37.647 --> 25:47.759
requisition half the cadet corps to spend three 
weeks or whatever length of time. It now has been a

25:48.841 --> 26:07.063
recent experience, and I don't know just where 
that all came in, but it was not an activity that

25:48.841 --> 26:07.063
totally, or say totally, or significantly 
disrupted student life for a while where there

25:48.841 --> 26:07.063
was, I don't know how many, thousand, I guess, of 
man and woman hours put in on it now, but I don't

26:07.381 --> 26:15.352
recall anything of that nature back then. I guess I 
do, I just recall the event and the football

26:15.392 --> 26:23.042
players getting up and making a few comments. Now, 
I'm assuming since you were, those undergraduate

26:24.084 --> 26:32.595
years were the fall of 36, you graduated in the 
spring of 38. That's correct, in June. I'm

26:34.563 --> 26:45.057
assuming that since World War II hadn't started 
yet, that you all didn't think that much about what

26:34.563 --> 26:45.057
was happening on the other side of the world.

26:48.101 --> 26:50.464
You weren't worried yet about World War II? During 
that 36 to 38? No, I would say that wasn't a big

26:54.029 --> 27:02.481
factor, although I guess by the time I graduated in 
the spring of 38... There was, I'd say, some

27:02.798 --> 27:29.741
realization of it, and the students were much more 
interested in being sure they got a commission

27:02.798 --> 27:29.741
financially and otherwise, but there was a good 
deal of competition for it, and all the students

27:02.798 --> 27:29.741
who performed reasonably well were able to get 
commissions at that time, and I believe quite a few

27:02.798 --> 27:29.741
went on into the service after graduation in 1938. 
Right now... Did you have any, was there any

27:32.532 --> 27:38.200
awkwardness in your getting an Aggie senior rank? 
No, I don't recall any. I want to be sure and include

27:39.982 --> 27:42.025
this comment. I may have given a totally negative 
impression of coming in here as a transfer. I was

27:47.853 --> 27:56.584
treated very considerably by the Corps members as 
an individual, them as individuals, me as an

27:47.853 --> 27:56.584
individual. It was just a situation you just 
didn't fit in anywhere precisely, and... That was

28:02.941 --> 28:13.397
just part of it, but individually, whether they 
were seniors or freshmen or what, they treated

28:02.941 --> 28:13.397
me... Did you acquire a nickname? I was called 
Johnny, if that's a... But nothing else? No, not

28:19.826 --> 28:22.891
these real exotic nicknames. Not Cotton Topper? 
Topper. Arkansas.

28:29.201 --> 28:30.543
There's one thing I want to mention. I don't know 
whether this... occurred right after I

28:32.675 --> 28:35.379
graduated. I

28:35.399 --> 28:46.314
just went to two years in the spring of 38. I was 
taking mainly senior courses then. Are

28:49.639 --> 28:54.666
you familiar with the Cotton Tour? Well, in the 
30s, it was, I think, originated in the early 30s,

28:56.587 --> 29:01.711
perhaps. By 38, this is probably the 8th or 10th 
tour, I don't recall which, but it had been started

29:01.992 --> 29:26.593
primarily by Professor Mogford, who was the 
cotton expert and thought it would be a great thing

29:01.992 --> 29:26.593
to publicize the university and to reward 
students and get information out on the the major

29:27.147 --> 29:33.215
crop of the state at that time and of course the 
primary force in agriculture almost then. So he

29:33.255 --> 29:41.205
originated this cotton tour I'm going to say about 
1930 probably. And the concept was that there

29:42.747 --> 29:52.961
would be examinations given over different 
phases of cotton production and development and

29:42.747 --> 29:52.961
so forth. And these were somewhat difficult exams 
and were given during the spring and were open for

29:57.100 --> 30:24.643
competition by any students and I entered the 
competition without any thought of winning since

29:57.100 --> 30:24.643
well one I hadn't been there all four years so I 
didn't think I'd absorbed as much as some of the

29:57.100 --> 30:24.643
others would have but anyway we went through the 
spring taking these exams I think once a week say

29:57.100 --> 30:24.643
they'd be cotton pathology and entomology and 
production and breeding and spinning and all

30:25.079 --> 30:32.608
those things. Believe it or not, I was one of the 
winners. There were three, just three winners. In

30:39.696 --> 30:51.389
retrospect, particularly, that was probably the 
greatest award you could have received from A&M as

30:39.696 --> 30:51.389
far as actual benefit. We managed a 10-week paid 
tour during the summer immediately after taking

30:55.066 --> 31:01.095
the exams and those who had qualified. So that was a 
real privilege and something I'll always

31:01.896 --> 31:07.884
remember. This is right after you graduated? 
Right immediately afterward.

31:14.843 --> 31:16.767
anticipating marriage at the time. I don't know 
whether you knew Margaret or not. She probably

31:22.638 --> 31:26.405
passed away just before you came back here. Summer 
of 97, I guess. Anyway, we had been going.
