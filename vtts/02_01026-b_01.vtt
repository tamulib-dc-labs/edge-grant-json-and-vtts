00:01.482 --> 00:31.101
whether it makes it legal illegal what makes it 
right or wrong is whether you win or lose you know

00:01.482 --> 00:31.101
this country hasn't settled anything since world 
war ii and you can never and i say never and i mean

00:01.482 --> 00:31.101
never you can never settle any political 
confrontation by political means when that first

00:01.482 --> 00:31.101
bullet has been fired you cannot settle it 
politically You have to go in there and finish it.

00:36.193 --> 00:38.656
And whoever wins, they're the ones that's right. 
They had the biggest dig. They won. We settled the

00:41.739 --> 00:45.784
Pacific Front with Japan. It was settled. Y'all 
lost, and we won. We settled the European Front.

00:53.313 --> 00:55.276
Germany, y'all lost, and we won. There wasn't any 
negotiations. It's not, we'll sign if you give us.

01:00.899 --> 01:03.201
It was unconditional surrender. It was settled. 
It was finished. It was over with. Vietnam has

01:08.167 --> 01:11.290
been, I've been here 20 years, back 20 years. It's 
still not settled. It's not going to be settled. It

01:15.655 --> 01:17.597
will never be settled, ever. It will not be 
settled. It cannot be settled politically. It can

01:23.403 --> 01:30.771
only be settled by force.

01:31.460 --> 01:38.549
When we're talking about the South Vietnamese 
Army, did you ever feel that they had a real desire

01:31.460 --> 01:38.549
to be fighting the North Vietnamese? No. I think 
they were just doing what they had. They were kind

01:42.855 --> 01:46.300
of caught between a rock and a hard place, too. You 
know, they didn't want to leave their families. If

01:48.563 --> 01:51.567
you don't leave, you know, what do you got to do? 
What do you got to fight? So they just would go visit

01:53.409 --> 01:57.054
when they wanted, come back and fight when they 
wanted? Yeah. I mean, they suffered for it when

01:59.675 --> 02:01.897
they got back, you know. I mean, they were beaten, 
thrown in prison, thrown in stockades, thrown in,

02:01.917 --> 02:11.705
I've seen lots of things happen to them, you know, 
personally. It's just that, but if you didn't go

02:13.587 --> 02:17.410
home, I mean, when would you go home? When you came 
back here from Vietnam, what was life like? Was it

02:22.534 --> 02:26.537
hard for you to adjust back to these surroundings 
as a civilian? Did you have flashbacks from over

02:27.718 --> 02:29.580
there? No, I haven't ever had any flashbacks. I 
don't know if it's because I was a little older when

02:35.923 --> 02:39.846
I went over there. Most of those kids were 18, 19, 20 
years old. Well, crud, that's just a baby. I had my

02:48.154 --> 02:55.521
25th birthday sitting on top of my tank, you know, 
in effect. So I was, you know, mid-twenties. And

03:00.481 --> 03:07.409
maybe those few extra years gave me a little bit 
more time emotionally to mature out or whatever.

03:08.811 --> 03:16.199
But I've seen little red-headed freckle-faced 
kids hop off a chopper, you know, wouldn't hurt a

03:08.811 --> 03:16.199
fly, never hurt a fly. He's there, you know, serve 
his country. And, you know, it's still not real to

03:20.244 --> 03:23.909
him. But the first firefight that you get into it, 
if you survive, What happens is you basically turn

03:28.370 --> 03:34.096
into a real cold, hard animal. And there again, 
that's hard to explain to somebody

03:35.178 --> 03:47.331
that hadn't done that. And it's kind of like you 
have a hard time, even your World War II veterans

03:48.012 --> 03:56.622
and Korean veterans. They don't really 
understand the Vietnam veteran mindset. They

04:03.099 --> 04:08.547
don't understand why most of the Vietnam veterans 
don't join the VFW. They don't join the American

04:08.747 --> 04:11.491
Legion. And these World War II times have done a lot 
of outreaching to those people, and it's met with

04:11.511 --> 04:22.266
little success. Why is it that they don't? I don't 
know for sure, but I think part of it might be if

04:26.757 --> 04:44.506
you'll talk to a Vietnam, I mean a World War II 
veteran, he was with H Company of the Fourth Army or

04:26.757 --> 04:44.506
something like that. And they went over there. 
They trained as a unit. They went over there as a

04:47.390 --> 04:49.053
unit. They stayed there for the duration as a unit. 
Everyone knew everyone. If you'll look in the San

04:54.314 --> 05:03.288
Antonio paper, you'll see that the 318th Bomb 
Squadron is having its 40th reunion this year or

04:54.314 --> 05:03.288
something like that. And all these different 
units have all these reunions. They're still

05:07.875 --> 05:09.037
having reunions. They have them all the time. They 
meet in Hawaii. They meet in Phoenix. They meet in

05:12.582 --> 05:13.564
San Antonio. They'll meet in Miami. And they had 
this closeness that they were all there together.

05:18.211 --> 05:19.373
Vietnam wasn't like that. You didn't know 
anybody. Because everybody was always coming and

05:23.305 --> 05:25.067
going. You know, all these people that were in and 
out all the time. I don't know anybody. You know,

05:31.475 --> 05:37.002
and I certainly don't have anything in common with 
the World War II times, you know. And even though

05:38.003 --> 05:46.814
I've shown my little movies and stuff like that for 
some VFW and some American Legion, I've shown

05:38.003 --> 05:46.814
those, you know.

05:50.178 --> 05:50.899
But, you know. There wasn't that. There was not 
that closeness where you really got to know

05:53.545 --> 06:02.198
everybody and you did something for four years 
together. Because you were being transferred,

06:02.679 --> 06:06.004
going and joining other... Yeah. I mean, like for 
me, I was in four, you might say four different

06:06.464 --> 06:12.553
units, you know, with people coming and going all 
the time. I can see that. So you really, I mean, it's

06:16.039 --> 06:19.283
just a bunch of strangers, you know. Yet you might 
come back to your hometown... and you might know

06:22.722 --> 06:27.186
somebody who was there and you have a little 
comradeship there. You had something in common

06:27.226 --> 06:29.608
with this person and that person. But to answer 
your question, I don't have any flashbacks. I

06:36.313 --> 06:40.177
think about it a lot.

06:44.160 --> 06:52.307
When I came back, I came back to Lubbock, Texas, 
which was basically a very conservative, very

06:44.160 --> 06:52.307
patriotic area of the country. you know, I got all 
this baby killer, why did you go over there, you

06:53.097 --> 07:08.720
know, you're the one that's wrong, you know, I 
didn't get any, you know, when Johnny come

06:53.097 --> 07:08.720
marching home again type, there was no parades, 
there was no, you know, anything like that. I had

07:09.522 --> 07:21.159
one thing on a positive nature really that, and 
that happened in Kerrville, Texas in 1986 when I

07:09.522 --> 07:21.159
first came to Kerrville. I had a girl that I just 
happened to mention that I was in Vietnam. And she

07:28.248 --> 07:33.894
just put her arm around me and hugged me and said, 
thank you. I just met her. That's the only person

07:37.397 --> 07:41.702
that's ever said, you might say, to me, anything 
positive.

07:44.745 --> 07:46.467
And that was many, many years after? Yeah. But it's 
not that there are not a lot of people out there that

07:46.607 --> 07:51.792
don't feel that way. you just had one person, you 
know. And not that I'm looking for it, I just kind of

07:55.788 --> 08:11.384
think that, you know, probably had it not 
happened, I wouldn't think anything about it, but

07:55.788 --> 08:11.384
because it did, I do think something about it.

08:11.404 --> 08:16.268
Um, your views, have they changed since the end of 
the war, and how do you view the war? Do you view it

08:16.289 --> 08:17.229
the same way? Yeah, I think I do. I wouldn't mind 
going back to Vietnam. But the only way I would go to

08:26.071 --> 08:39.108
Vietnam or any other Vietnam-like place, whether 
it's Nicaragua or someplace like that, the only

08:26.071 --> 08:39.108
basis I would go down there on would be that you 
leave me alone. You want me to do a job, I'll do it.

08:41.591 --> 08:42.472
But I ain't going to stop. And you're not going to 
stop me. Have an unconditional. Have an

08:46.337 --> 08:47.098
unconditional. If you want to go down there, hey, 
guys, we need your help, fine. I'll be the first one

08:51.204 --> 08:52.305
on the ship. But you're not going to tell me don't 
shoot in a banana plantation. Don't shoot in a

08:56.609 --> 09:00.036
rubber plantation, because you're going to 
damage a plant. I ain't going to play that kind of

09:00.918 --> 09:03.243
stuff again. So tell me in general how the American 
soldiers felt about these situations. Well, of

09:10.426 --> 09:14.711
course, I guess everybody has their own little 
personal observation on it. Another thing that

09:15.172 --> 09:24.543
really, really irritated me about most of the 
Vietnam movies that I've seen, especially

09:15.172 --> 09:24.543
Platoon, it perpetrated to me the American 
soldier as a very negative type person. I told you

09:26.045 --> 09:38.560
I've spoken at probably 200 different little 
organizations over the years, and I have found,

09:26.045 --> 09:38.560
and part of my little speech that I give is that you 
can be proud of the way the American fighting man

09:38.928 --> 09:44.816
conducted himself out in the field. Because what I 
observed was he did it on as gentlemanly a basis as

09:47.059 --> 09:54.529
you could expect. And I personally was proud of the 
way the American conducted himself. But yet you

10:01.399 --> 10:08.048
have the news media in Hollywood perpetrates an 
entirely different picture and how many people

10:01.399 --> 10:08.048
get to listen to Mike Sullivan? Not very many. 
That's because when these people on television

10:09.438 --> 10:14.282
know what sells money. That's right. And they have 
a personal axe to grind to, and I wish there was no

10:16.004 --> 10:23.471
wars in the world, and I wish there was no diseases 
out there, too. But there is, and you can't just

10:24.031 --> 10:31.458
play ostrich and bury your head in the sand and play 
like it's not happening. And I think we do that as a

10:31.618 --> 10:38.584
nation, you know, These same people, though, I'm 
talking about your Kennedys, your Jane Fondas,

10:39.020 --> 10:48.936
those kind of people, who get up there and say, oh, 
let's don't get in a war. And nobody likes war. And

10:50.800 --> 10:54.806
especially, you know, the military don't like it 
because they're the guys out doing it. So they

10:55.527 --> 10:56.850
really don't like it. But yet I think most people 
really realize that America didn't just happen

10:57.611 --> 11:04.302
and there has been some blood spilt. and that we 
today are deriving the benefits from that past

11:05.176 --> 11:35.014
sacrifice and people forget about that and these 
thinking politicians are selling those basic

11:05.176 --> 11:35.014
freedoms and rights away every day little by 
little they're sitting there and they're just

11:05.176 --> 11:35.014
duck nibbling you every day you lose a little bit 
more and because Well, there's no sense in getting

11:35.450 --> 11:37.112
upset about it. It's not that big of a deal. This is 
like giving a nice example. That, to me, is like two

11:40.295 --> 11:45.241
days ago, and I found that kid down in Mexico. And I 
personally, it really bothered me. I mean, I woke

11:49.205 --> 11:51.648
up at night, and it was 4 o'clock in the morning. I 
couldn't go to sleep just thinking about that and

11:51.668 --> 11:57.074
disgusted here at the bank. I got more upset about 
it. But yet now, another day's gone by, and it's not

11:58.896 --> 12:03.381
as upsetting to me. So, you know, we'll just forget 
about it. No sense rounding up an army and going out

12:06.078 --> 12:08.741
there and buying the suckers. So you forget about 
that. You forget about lots of things like that.

12:13.927 --> 12:15.789
Well, that really irritates me. And I think 
another nice deal that's happening right now,

12:17.231 --> 12:24.679
it's happening right this very minute, is Exxon 
makes a mistake. And the price of the gasoline

12:26.681 --> 12:30.045
pumps already got up 20 cents a gallon. I heard this 
morning that President Texaco said it's going to

12:30.505 --> 12:35.511
go up at least another 25 cents a gallon. And what? 
The price of oil hadn't gone up. And they're going

12:40.274 --> 12:44.298
to have a 50% increase in price and no price in crude 
going up? The same old deal is the American

12:46.200 --> 12:49.043
taxpayers getting screwed. The American working 
slobs out there paying for somebody else's

12:49.503 --> 12:53.567
mistakes. Whether it's big corporations or big 
government, we're still going to pay for their

12:53.708 --> 12:59.013
mistakes. See, they're not responsible for 
anything. And that's a big problem in America is

13:02.576 --> 13:07.101
our government technically makes nobody 
responsible for anything. And those are your

13:10.781 --> 13:23.034
liberties that are getting eaten away with 
because you've got these crime figures that are

13:10.781 --> 13:23.034
out there taking things away from you and nothing 
happens to them. You know what I'm talking about.

13:25.937 --> 13:28.760
And even if you caught them, what would happen to 
them? And what do you think is going to happen to

13:28.840 --> 13:31.443
them if they catch the sucker? You think they'll be 
shot? Do you? Yeah, do you think I'd be shot?

13:40.537 --> 13:41.078
That's right. If they even make it there, if 
they've got room for them. And see, that's just a

13:45.986 --> 13:49.792
common belief because you know that's what 
happens. You hear about justice, but America

13:50.252 --> 13:53.177
doesn't really want justice. If they wanted 
justice, all they have to do is just put it in a

13:53.697 --> 13:56.862
computer. Did you do this? Yes? No. Push the 
button. Guilty? No. or not guilty, that's the way

14:00.845 --> 14:02.527
to come out. So if we wanted true justice, it'd be 
real cheap, real fast, and just push a button, and

14:02.547 --> 14:09.914
everybody would get justice. You either did it or 
you didn't do it. There's no gray. You're not just a

14:13.118 --> 14:15.080
little bit pregnant. You're either you are or 
you're not. You've never known anybody just a

14:18.583 --> 14:21.486
little bit pregnant, have you? Just a smidge, just 
kind of a little, you know, it doesn't happen, does

14:21.506 --> 14:25.390
it? What do you think Saigon felt? Why? Do I think it 
fell? We talked about the government being

14:32.390 --> 14:35.453
corrupt. Well, I mean, Saigon is like the 
Washington. That's their capital. When you take

14:41.099 --> 14:46.444
over the capital, you've made a statement. Like if 
the communists come in and take over New York City

14:46.544 --> 14:52.410
or Washington, D.C., they've made a statement. 
They don't have to take care of Kerrville. And it

14:54.692 --> 14:57.675
fell 15 months after we pulled out. How did you feel 
when you heard that? We were pouring out, and all

15:00.650 --> 15:03.372
those men were coming. Well, I'll tell you what. 
I'll make a statement that I told my wife. In fact, I

15:07.656 --> 15:10.639
told her, I said, well, let me tell you what's going 
to happen. They're going to come in from Cambodia,

15:11.039 --> 15:16.524
because I knew where everybody was. And I said, 
they're going to go this way, and they're going to

15:18.366 --> 15:21.329
go that way. And without exception, I called every 
single town, every single item, as it happened by

15:21.389 --> 15:28.856
the day. And I did it beforehand. You know, to my 
wife. I said, this is what you hide and watch as if it

15:32.670 --> 15:35.055
don't happen. And I mean, it happened just like I 
had a crystal ball. Because as I told you before,

15:38.522 --> 15:42.750
war really is a very simple deal. And when the 
opposition leaves, buddy, you just take the path

15:43.371 --> 15:51.767
of least resistance, you know.

16:01.990 --> 16:08.116
Well, by talking to you, I can tell that you're 
proud of what you did because you did what you were

16:01.990 --> 16:08.116
supposed to do. And you probably could have done it 
better if the politicians hadn't interfered. Do

16:15.823 --> 16:16.844
you believe that right? I think that's exactly 
right. I'll tell you something else. I'm not

16:22.489 --> 16:29.415
trying to beat my own tom-tom there a little bit, 
but I want to tell you something that I felt very

16:22.489 --> 16:29.415
strongly about. before I went over there, and one 
of them is I really cared, you know, and the eight

16:29.834 --> 16:49.959
months that I was actually in the field, you know, 
either commanding a tank platoon or commanding

16:29.834 --> 16:49.959
some infantry type unit, you know how many 
Americans I got killed that was underneath my

16:29.834 --> 16:49.959
command? Zero. And that was in 68 and 69, the fun 
time, okay? Now, maybe a little bit of it was due to

16:56.918 --> 17:26.689
my being a tactical genius right but maybe more of 
it and probably a little bit more realistically I

16:56.918 --> 17:26.689
think what it really had to do with is a term that has 
come out of the Vietnam War is a deal called body

16:56.918 --> 17:26.689
count you know and what happens you know some real 
smart guy from Harvard or someplace like that

16:56.918 --> 17:26.689
makes some little statements you know like

17:29.352 --> 17:34.297
If you can't manage it, or if you can't count it, 
then you can't manage it. If you can't control what

17:35.278 --> 17:39.002
the numbers are, you don't know if you're winning 
or losing. It's like cost accounting. You kind of

17:40.743 --> 17:42.966
got to know. So if you can't measure it, you can't 
manage it. That's kind of a catchy little saying

17:45.789 --> 17:49.532
that a lot of business people use. I think that got 
involved in Vietnam.

17:56.707 --> 18:25.347
somebody said we couldn't, you know, this back, 
you know, they're over there, really, they were

17:56.707 --> 18:25.347
over there in 63, you know, and nobody thought too 
much about it, you know, then things started

17:56.707 --> 18:25.347
happening, you know, a little bit more 
aggressively, like in 65, and started building

17:56.707 --> 18:25.347
up, and then things got a little hotter, you know, 
and then everybody started asking the question,

17:56.707 --> 18:25.347
well, how do you know if you're winning, you know, 
so in general, ask somebody, how do we know if we're

17:56.707 --> 18:25.347
winning, And the general says, well, we're 
killing more of them than they're killing us. And

18:33.944 --> 18:35.666
we're destroying more than they're destroying. 
And therefore, we're winning. And somebody says,

18:37.367 --> 18:38.809
how do you know? So the general says, how do we know? 
Well, we don't really know for sure. And then

18:46.155 --> 18:50.339
somebody, his advisor says, why don't we start 
counting? That's a good idea. So that's where this

18:52.420 --> 18:56.464
body count came from. The word comes down now that 
we're interested in how many people you killed

18:56.883 --> 19:01.128
today. You know, like, let's keep score. And so you 
kept score. Well, what happened then, especially

19:09.997 --> 19:20.369
with, and I'm going to say West Point people, 
because they are career people, and they're the

19:09.997 --> 19:20.369
ones that are in the Pentagon. They come up with 
these catchy little things. And they're the ones

19:22.511 --> 19:26.856
that basically are your career type people, not 
that others aren't. And I really would have liked

19:27.123 --> 19:29.105
to have stayed in the military. I did a good job, and 
I liked the Army. But had it not been for all the

19:36.013 --> 19:46.265
politics and stuff that I saw, especially with the 
West Point officers and that ring knocking, you

19:36.013 --> 19:46.265
know, let you know. They'd take their little West 
Point ring, and then, you know, if you start

19:46.365 --> 19:52.472
questioning this and that, they'd sit there. 
knock on, it's called a ring knocker, and they're

19:53.465 --> 20:10.245
letting you know, by gosh, I'm from West Point, I 
know, I make the decision, you have nothing to say

19:53.465 --> 20:10.245
about anything, you know, and that's where the 
term ring knocker comes from, because they're all

19:53.465 --> 20:10.245
real good about doing that, you know, let you know 
I'm West Point. Well, I'll tell you what, there's

20:10.265 --> 20:22.240
very few officers that have people under their 
command that, like I did, that can quote the kind of

20:10.265 --> 20:22.240
letters that I didn't write home, you know, 
Because I saw people get people killed for no

20:23.266 --> 20:27.831
reason. And because I really cared about your 
brother, your husband, your father, I wasn't

20:28.631 --> 20:42.085
going to unnecessarily risk their lives just in 
order to get some more body count or do this. Now, I

20:42.545 --> 20:49.472
will also say that I accomplished every mission 
that I was given without exception. Tell me to go

20:50.654 --> 20:52.075
over and do this, I did it. But anybody killed. 
That's what people wanted, but really not even

20:54.566 --> 21:00.636
real

20:54.566 --> 21:00.636
bad. What I'd call real bad, where you're going to 
get real, you know. So I was, and I'm fortunate, and

21:06.145 --> 21:12.155
I thank the Lord for that, that I didn't write those 
letters. But I'll tell you what, I worked at it too.

21:14.699 --> 21:16.262
I didn't want to write in those letters. Because 
I'll tell you, if I had, to have written a bunch of

21:19.882 --> 21:21.324
those letters. I guarantee you I probably 
wouldn't, I would have had some flashbacks or how I

21:21.344 --> 21:29.212
could have done that better or that, you know, I 
felt real guilty or bad about that. Well, I'm sure

21:29.772 --> 21:37.721
that your man was speaking to you and looked up more 
to you because they could see that you cared about

21:29.772 --> 21:37.721
them and they probably tried harder. Did you see 
that? Well, no, not necessarily. I think

21:42.446 --> 21:46.610
everybody wasn't really concerned about that or 
knew one way or the other. They were just doing

21:46.630 --> 21:47.951
their thing. Mm-hmm. You know, they did what they 
were told. It's just that I just had, you might say,

21:52.890 --> 21:59.076
a more conservative way of going about doing 
things is all. But I still got the job done. It may

22:00.417 --> 22:02.079
have been a little slower sometimes. You know, I 
may not have, you know, gone by somebody's

22:02.760 --> 22:07.905
stopwatch on me, you know. But I got the job done 
properly. If you had a message to college students

22:13.009 --> 22:18.795
today to try to clear up the misconceptions that 
they have about this war, What would you say to

22:19.366 --> 22:20.227
them? Don't believe what you read in the history 
books. Because most of it was written by people who

22:24.334 --> 22:26.697
weren't there.

22:29.642 --> 22:35.531
What would you tell them to go talk to action? I 
don't know how many people they could effectively

22:35.571 --> 22:38.756
talk to. Because you talk to me and you're getting 
just my version of it. I may be the only crazy one out

22:45.486 --> 22:48.090
there, you know. And I may be 100% wrong. You should 
probably read books on people that were there that

22:51.445 --> 22:57.791
fought, such as Caputo and Raymond O'Rourke. Did 
you see that? No, I haven't read anything. Really,

23:02.615 --> 23:05.097
to tell you the truth, I don't read anything about 
Lincoln. I'll tell you the truth. And the only

23:08.160 --> 23:17.689
reason I've seen those movies, I did want to go see 
the platoon because I heard so much about it, and it

23:08.160 --> 23:17.689
was written and directed by a guy who was a platoon 
leader. So I felt like it would be authentic. He did

23:21.257 --> 23:24.361
a lot of great things in there, in my opinion. One 
thing that he portrayed very well in the movie was I

23:25.042 --> 23:35.696
saw fear on people's faces. I mean, like they were 
just terrified, and I thought that was very real.

23:40.622 --> 23:43.005
You know, especially in those night actions where 
he saw people. Did you see it with him? I didn't see

23:44.166 --> 23:45.108
it with him. You ought to go see it. You ought to go 
see it because It says something, but I thought it

23:47.369 --> 23:54.256
was authentic. I thought the decor of everything, 
the vegetation, the equipment, I thought it was

23:54.276 --> 24:00.043
authentic. But I would just caution, not just 
Vietnam, because it's going to be like the Civil

24:01.905 --> 24:09.152
War and every other war. No one's going to really 
know what we were really doing over there. Because

24:15.466 --> 24:24.175
there's so many of the big players, the world 
players, like the Rockefellers, who have huge

24:15.466 --> 24:24.175
financial interests. When I talk about Exxon, I'm 
talking about Rockefeller. When I talk about

24:26.958 --> 24:30.342
Gulf, I'm talking about Rockefeller. And they do 
things for business reasons. And they get

24:32.885 --> 24:37.750
themselves in a jam, and they start hollering for 
our politicians to do something. I

24:37.910 --> 24:44.157
guess.
