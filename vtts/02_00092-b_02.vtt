WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:04.790
Yeah, I didn't see him very much.

00:05.030 --> 00:07.313
That's Dr. Harrington for the purpose of the machine.

00:09.036 --> 00:09.617
Yeah.

00:09.637 --> 00:12.421
We just didn't hang around the system building or wherever he was.

00:12.802 --> 00:19.512
You know, the only time we went over there was to have our core picture made, our company picture made on the steps.

00:19.532 --> 00:21.975
Was Gib Gilchrist, had he already become?

00:22.035 --> 00:22.756
He had gone.

00:22.817 --> 00:24.639
I think his last year was like 47.

00:24.920 --> 00:25.561
Okay.

00:27.043 --> 00:27.844
Yeah.

00:27.824 --> 00:30.668
Did Melvin Maltz, have you talked to him?

00:31.409 --> 00:32.070
Melvin Maltz?

00:32.251 --> 00:33.513
Yeah.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.394
Yeah.

00:34.414 --> 00:36.998
Did he tell you about when they marched on Gilchrist?

00:37.018 --> 00:37.679
Yes, yes.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.862
Then they fired everybody the next day?

00:40.042 --> 00:40.824
Yes, yes.

00:41.004 --> 00:45.090
And I want to go talk to Henry Gilchrist to get

00:45.070 --> 00:50.757
any version from his family and so on.

00:51.778 --> 00:52.660
Pinky Downs.

00:52.740 --> 00:54.602
Was Pinky on the campus in those days?

00:54.622 --> 00:55.603
Yeah, he was on the campus.

00:55.783 --> 00:56.965
Please describe P.L.

00:56.985 --> 00:57.786
Downs Jr.

00:57.906 --> 00:58.367
P.L.

00:58.387 --> 00:59.108
Downs Jr.

00:59.168 --> 01:03.874
was a very thin little guy that just went around.

01:05.095 --> 01:12.124
More people laughed at him, I guess, than did anything because it wasn't our style to

01:12.374 --> 01:26.932
act that way, but anyway, he was a legend, and we all loved him, of course, but it was, when you saw him, you talked to him, and he always had stories to tell you, you know, and we didn't see him too much.

01:27.173 --> 01:31.498
He wasn't in the areas where I was very often.

01:32.139 --> 01:33.481
Did he have an office?

01:35.183 --> 01:35.904
I'm not sure.

01:36.164 --> 01:36.865
I think he did.

01:36.905 --> 01:39.068
I've never known where?

01:39.088 --> 01:40.930
I'm not sure where it was, but

01:46.613 --> 01:48.816
As far as y'all knew, what was his job?

01:48.856 --> 01:50.117
What was his assignment?

01:51.198 --> 01:54.041
He was strictly a self-made PR guy.

01:55.363 --> 01:56.825
I don't think he got paid for it.

01:56.885 --> 02:00.068
I don't think he was, he just did it on his own.

02:00.108 --> 02:06.616
He just took, he just was, made himself known and just did it, you know, just did it on.

02:07.116 --> 02:09.439
It was kind of a strange deal.

02:09.579 --> 02:12.182
It'd be like me today, you know, just all of a sudden

02:12.753 --> 02:19.621
putting on a plaid coat and standing around and gig them and, you know, on the campus and everybody gets to know you, Shane.

02:21.283 --> 02:28.792
Now, at that time, the project houses had become married housing?

02:29.172 --> 02:30.254
Yes.

02:30.334 --> 02:31.715
And then College View.

02:32.656 --> 02:33.898
Uh-huh.

02:33.918 --> 02:38.203
Were there, when you got here, were there still some veterans enrolled?

02:39.280 --> 02:40.401
Oh, yeah.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.183
Yeah, that's when it really started in 48.

02:42.404 --> 02:44.726
See, they got out in 46 when the war was over.

02:45.667 --> 02:55.739
So 47, 8, and 9 is when the classes really started in 51, 52 they were.

02:56.179 --> 02:58.822
What were those veterans like as students?

02:59.944 --> 03:02.026
They were bad because they all made good grades.

03:02.607 --> 03:05.490
So the curve wasn't as high for us, you know.

03:07.613 --> 03:14.346
But they were here to study and I wish they did to get out because they understood the program.

03:14.366 --> 03:19.776
We were still too young to understand the program at that time and immature or whatever you call it.

03:20.698 --> 03:23.563
But it was good having them around.

03:23.830 --> 03:26.955
Did their wives work in lots of the offices on campus?

03:26.975 --> 03:37.090
Oh, yeah, most all the offices where they worked and helped put them through school because the GI Bill was not that much, so they needed, however, it didn't cost much to live here either.

03:37.371 --> 03:44.882
You know, I think it was $35 a month in those vet housing over there, and that's all the utilities and everything.

03:46.064 --> 03:49.990
Had to buy a little food and a gallon of...

03:50.408 --> 03:53.353
Thunderbird wine every Friday night or Saturday, you know.

03:53.373 --> 03:54.735
No idea.

03:54.755 --> 03:56.317
What was there at Northgate?

03:58.160 --> 03:58.921
At Northgate?

03:59.082 --> 04:00.364
Restaurants.

04:00.384 --> 04:01.185
Mostly restaurants.

04:01.365 --> 04:01.626
Such as?

04:01.646 --> 04:02.327
And bookstores.

04:02.427 --> 04:02.948
Such as?

04:04.330 --> 04:07.455
Well, just eating places and

04:07.773 --> 04:14.621
I think the camera shop was there, the boot shop was there, cleaners were there, just the usual stores like that.

04:14.682 --> 04:17.285
There wasn't churches, plenty of churches.

04:17.785 --> 04:20.729
Did you and your buddies ever go to the campus theater?

04:21.049 --> 04:21.891
Oh, yeah.

04:21.911 --> 04:30.041
Yeah, that was a Saturday night deal because you could walk up there, you know, and so that was good.

04:30.962 --> 04:36.008
They'd have a midnight show every now and then that you could go to and stay out late and

04:37.405 --> 04:44.891
Now, on stay out late, could a student be out late during the week in the Corps?

04:44.911 --> 04:45.112
No.

04:45.132 --> 04:45.292
No, no.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.133
We have the same CQ.

04:47.394 --> 04:48.755
I guess they still have today.

04:48.795 --> 04:55.941
From 7 to 10, you had to be at your desk studying, particularly the freshmen and sophomores.

04:55.961 --> 04:59.264
Juniors had a little bit more privilege, and then seniors didn't have to be there.

04:59.284 --> 05:06.450
But freshmen and sophomores had to be there from 7 to 10 unless you got a pass to go to the library or whatever.

05:06.430 --> 05:12.921
And then at 10 o'clock, they turned the lights out, so you had to have a late lights pass if you were going to stay up and study past 10.

05:13.683 --> 05:19.553
And the first sergeant gave you that or whatever, so they weren't hard to come by.

05:19.573 --> 05:21.055
But anyway, you had to ask permission.

05:21.075 --> 05:28.388
It had to be on your door if you were not there or if you had a late lights pass, so in case one of the TAC officers came by.

05:28.807 --> 05:33.654
Did you have to get a pass to go off campus between, say, 7 and 10?

05:34.475 --> 05:36.939
Between 7 and 10 at night?

05:36.959 --> 05:37.479
Oh, yeah.

05:39.342 --> 05:43.348
By the time you left the dorm between 7 and 10, you had to have a pass.

05:43.608 --> 05:45.651
Let's make believe you just wanted to go to the movie.

05:46.252 --> 05:47.594
Yeah, you had to have a pass.

05:47.694 --> 05:49.537
Well, you'd get a library pass.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.818
And then go to the movie instead?

05:50.839 --> 05:53.562
Yeah, right.

05:53.582 --> 05:55.065
It had to be a study period.

05:55.245 --> 05:58.189
How often did you go downtown, Brian?

05:58.169 --> 06:03.338
We'd go down on Saturdays and maybe Sundays sometime to the movie down there.

06:03.358 --> 06:04.240
It was in an urban.

06:05.221 --> 06:07.465
It was five miles from here to Bryan.

06:07.505 --> 06:09.449
Was the interurban working during your day?

06:09.469 --> 06:09.569
Yeah.

06:09.589 --> 06:10.070
Oh, it was.

06:10.190 --> 06:10.811
Where'd you catch it?

06:11.673 --> 06:14.057
Caught it up at the train station.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.782
I believe that's where it was.

06:17.663 --> 06:19.266
Well, maybe it wasn't up there.

06:20.933 --> 06:27.670
I can't remember now whether it went down College Avenue or whether, I think it followed the regular train tracks down into town.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.840
And we caught it up there and, God, these things are so big.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.524
Do you remember what it cost?

06:33.544 --> 06:34.627
Oh, it was a nickel or so.

06:34.968 --> 06:35.629
Wasn't very much.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.436
Ran about how often?

06:38.838 --> 06:41.202
Probably every hour, two hours, something like that.

06:41.263 --> 06:42.705
It wasn't very frequent.

06:43.146 --> 06:45.290
And when you went to Bryan, you went in uniform.

06:45.531 --> 06:45.871
Oh, yeah.

06:46.092 --> 06:47.013
Went in uniform.

06:47.234 --> 06:53.405
Got in fights with the Allen Academy kids because they were all both uniformed at that time.

06:54.367 --> 06:58.635
How did their uniform look compared to Aggie uniforms?

06:58.615 --> 07:07.653
It was, I don't know, the only way I know it describes a little high schoolish type thing, or it had a blue stripe on it, or it was different.

07:07.673 --> 07:08.615
You could tell the difference.

07:08.635 --> 07:10.178
I think it had blue stripes on it.

07:11.501 --> 07:14.788
Of course, they had different brass than we did.

07:14.988 --> 07:16.371
And it was a...

07:16.351 --> 07:20.535
military style, high school, and junior college?

07:20.696 --> 07:20.856
No.

07:21.016 --> 07:24.760
Well, it went from elementary school through two years of junior college.

07:25.401 --> 07:25.581
Oh, okay.

07:25.601 --> 07:30.186
Yeah, it was a full spectrum of, and they lived on the campus.

07:30.206 --> 07:34.991
There were little guys like this come to town in a uniform, you know, big hat.

07:35.011 --> 07:40.697
Were there any places, special places to eat or soda fountain and so forth, downtown Bryan?

07:40.757 --> 07:43.540
Oh, there were a few drugstores down there, you know.

07:44.735 --> 07:47.458
that we went to on occasion, hamburgers and all.

07:48.779 --> 07:54.686
If you and your buddies wanted to go out for just a good time on a Saturday night, where would it be?

07:57.088 --> 08:10.523
Well, I'll have to say I don't really know, because those people, we didn't have a car in the outfit, so the juniors wouldn't loan you their car, and the freshmen wouldn't, you know, it just wasn't, we had one

08:11.870 --> 08:13.372
classmate in our outfit.

08:13.392 --> 08:14.173
I take that back.

08:14.553 --> 08:29.833
A guy named Stallings from North Texas had a Studebaker coupe, had a board in the back for the back seat, and too many of us couldn't get in there.

08:29.893 --> 08:32.757
So we didn't do that very often, but I don't know.

08:33.358 --> 08:40.527
We were too young to drink, and I'd been running track all the time, so I didn't, you know, so I just

08:42.093 --> 08:45.981
In terms of good times, how much smoking did Aggies do?

08:46.682 --> 08:47.163
Not much.

08:48.466 --> 08:49.388
I can't remember.

08:49.608 --> 08:50.890
If they smoked, what did they smoke?

08:53.275 --> 08:54.758
I can't remember anybody smoking.

08:55.179 --> 08:55.580
You can't?

08:55.941 --> 08:56.181
No.

08:58.726 --> 09:02.654
Did you and your buddies even know the words marijuana or heroin?

09:02.674 --> 09:02.734
No.

09:03.676 --> 09:04.657
Not to my knowledge.

09:04.697 --> 09:05.338
They didn't know it.

09:06.720 --> 09:17.315
And we've heard about LaGrange and the Chicken Ranch now, but was that known at College Station when you were a student?

09:17.335 --> 09:17.575
Yes.

09:17.795 --> 09:18.136
It was?

09:18.276 --> 09:19.938
Oh, yeah.

09:20.339 --> 09:22.081
Did some Aggies supposedly go over there?

09:22.462 --> 09:22.562
Yeah.

09:24.567 --> 09:31.735
As far as I know, the big boys told me about it today.

09:31.755 --> 09:34.619
Let's see, we talked about, oh, important question.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.642
Describe the student body in general.

09:38.043 --> 09:41.867
Where did, in your era, where did Aggies come from, city or the country?

09:42.228 --> 09:46.873
What were their values, their attitudes, their judgments, their feelings?

09:49.496 --> 09:51.098
As far as I can recall,

09:52.934 --> 09:54.536
We had people from everywhere.

09:55.397 --> 09:59.803
I mean, they came from all areas because that was a poor time.

09:59.823 --> 10:01.004
The school was cheap.

10:01.024 --> 10:02.366
It was a land-grant school.

10:03.327 --> 10:04.549
So it was all farmers.

10:04.709 --> 10:09.215
You know, it was what the... Can I say this without heresy?

10:09.255 --> 10:14.641
It was what the school was put here for instead of today's... Excuse me.

10:16.424 --> 10:17.345
You'd strike that out.

10:19.407 --> 10:21.490
But their values were...

10:22.938 --> 10:23.760
all uptown.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.325
We're all very high caliber people.

10:26.425 --> 10:27.909
It was always yes sir, no sir.

10:28.350 --> 10:31.035
It was always yes ma'am and no ma'am.

10:31.115 --> 10:34.703
The mothers came, you know, and it was

10:35.813 --> 10:41.828
We always took care of everybody, but their values were just high.

10:43.212 --> 10:53.417
I have to say this, I think it's why we had a lot of the Jewish community come to this school, because when you came here,

10:53.785 --> 10:59.435
And put on a uniform, no one knew who you were, how much money you had.

10:59.495 --> 11:01.038
They didn't care.

11:01.078 --> 11:05.245
Everything you did in those days were on your marriage as a student.

11:05.766 --> 11:14.562
You were elected to the corporal, you were elected to the first sergeant, to the CO by the student body, by your peers in the company, or...

11:16.027 --> 11:24.660
The Corps commander, I think, went up before his peers would nominate them or something, and then they'd go for interviews to the staff.

11:25.682 --> 11:31.631
But everybody was the same, and all the values were the same.

11:31.891 --> 11:41.286
We didn't say, well, you're Jewish, you know, because when they called Fish Jones to hit the hall, everybody hit the hall.

11:41.727 --> 11:43.249
It didn't make any difference.

11:43.448 --> 11:51.186
whether you had a dollar or a hundred dollars in your pocket, or whether a kid in my outfit, while he was there, inherited 200, 200?

11:52.429 --> 12:00.107
Inherited like 50, 60,000 acres from his grandmother.

12:02.011 --> 12:05.396
or 25,000 acres, some big ranch.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.705
But when they called him to come, he was right there with the rest of us.

12:11.005 --> 12:14.470
You know, so it was great to be here.

12:14.611 --> 12:17.094
It was great to be a part of this place.

12:17.115 --> 12:19.378
And you look at the people

12:20.168 --> 12:29.197
In those days, how much we think of the school, we come back to everything, we give to everything, you know, we just run out of money.

12:30.898 --> 12:39.687
I had a friend of mine on a bus going to a football game one day said, if you're not Republican or Jewish or an Aggie, what do you do with all your money?

12:43.811 --> 12:47.715
Now, so you mentioned Jewish.

12:47.735 --> 12:50.057
Were there some Hispanic?

12:51.472 --> 12:52.293
Very few.

12:53.334 --> 12:54.875
Why, I don't know.

12:55.436 --> 13:00.841
But there were no blacks, of course, which I don't know why either, but they just... State law.

13:01.682 --> 13:02.062
What was it?

13:02.142 --> 13:02.983
That wasn't A&M.

13:04.705 --> 13:06.186
I didn't know that.

13:06.206 --> 13:07.267
Segregated education.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.735
But there were some Hispanics here.

13:15.435 --> 13:17.237
Were there some international students?

13:18.438 --> 13:19.099
Not too many.

13:20.564 --> 13:22.026
Not too many in those days.

13:22.046 --> 13:24.710
What about city and country?

13:27.354 --> 13:33.603
Of course, they were more from the city because there's more of us in the city, but a lot from the country.

13:33.643 --> 13:40.112
I guess in my outfit, most of the track people were probably from the cities.

13:42.715 --> 13:50.166
Probably most of the, in my outfit, and when I went over to B Infantry,

13:50.298 --> 13:55.025
I guess it was 50-50 between country.

13:55.125 --> 14:07.983
They were from Houston, El Paso, but there was some from San Antonio, some from Paris, and some from smaller towns and that.

14:08.364 --> 14:14.753
Anyway, it was about a 50-50 deal, taking agriculture.

14:15.526 --> 14:17.270
engineering or whatever we were taking.

14:18.273 --> 14:18.694
All right.

14:19.215 --> 14:29.240
As far as you and your buddies were concerned, what were thought of as the toughest majors and the least demanding academic majors then?

14:29.401 --> 14:30.784
Engineering was the toughest.

14:31.068 --> 14:32.871
And it was run and play with B&A.

14:33.752 --> 14:37.859
When you couldn't pass anything else, you dropped down and went into College of Business.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.562
What was the college then?

14:39.582 --> 14:41.024
The School of Business it was then.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.350
Because it was all reading classes.

14:44.470 --> 14:46.453
You went to class from about 8 to 12.

14:46.694 --> 14:48.216
That's all the classes you had.

14:48.196 --> 14:52.621
Unless you were taking an accounting course, you'd have an afternoon, two-hour lab or something.

14:52.641 --> 14:52.841
All right.

14:52.861 --> 14:55.745
And you changed your major in your first?

14:55.765 --> 14:59.709
Yeah, from engineering to industrial technology, my second semester.

14:59.729 --> 15:01.251
And that was in engineering?

15:01.631 --> 15:03.093
Yeah, it's in the College of Engineering.

15:03.453 --> 15:03.894
Okay.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.658
And you, who was the dean of engineering then?

15:09.060 --> 15:09.961
Benson.

15:09.981 --> 15:10.181
Who?

15:10.582 --> 15:10.962
Benson.

15:13.565 --> 15:14.626
Dean Benson, wasn't he?

15:15.127 --> 15:16.228
Was he in the 50s?

15:21.102 --> 15:23.746
I don't think so because I think he follows Calhoun.

15:29.453 --> 15:34.801
Who was that guy?

15:34.921 --> 15:37.064
Who was the guy before Calhoun then?

15:37.304 --> 15:37.885
I can't remember.

15:38.846 --> 15:39.347
Right now.

15:41.670 --> 15:46.136
And you turned to Dr. McGuire for advice.

15:46.176 --> 15:50.923
And what did you think that...

15:51.207 --> 15:53.111
major was preparing you to do?

15:53.872 --> 16:00.284
Well, I ended up wanting to be a safety engineer, which is what it did, which is what I started out as when I got out of school.

16:02.969 --> 16:04.091
Did you go to summer school ever?

16:05.093 --> 16:05.594
Yeah.

16:05.614 --> 16:05.874
Where?

16:06.275 --> 16:06.576
Houston.

16:07.197 --> 16:07.518
Oh, okay.

16:07.678 --> 16:08.239
But not here?

16:08.419 --> 16:08.740
Not here.

16:09.341 --> 16:13.148
I went to summer school here

16:14.731 --> 16:17.797
Well, no, I went to Houston most of the time.

16:17.817 --> 16:20.762
I took one semester in Houston, I think.

16:20.782 --> 16:25.170
In the summer of 1950 in Korea, a war started.

16:26.292 --> 16:31.862
What did you and your buddies think about that when you came to school in the fall of 1950?

16:32.315 --> 16:39.263
It got worse and worse, and then in January of 51, a lot of people didn't finish the semester all across.

16:39.823 --> 16:41.645
Well, I left and went in the Navy.

16:41.906 --> 16:42.366
Oh, you did?

16:42.767 --> 16:42.867
Yeah.

16:42.887 --> 16:47.372
My grades had dropped a little bit, so I thought, well, I better get my time in.

16:47.432 --> 16:50.135
So I left and went in the Navy.

16:51.256 --> 16:53.018
When did you go?

16:53.158 --> 16:55.321
I went in the Navy in 51.

16:56.382 --> 16:59.385
April of 50, I guess.

16:59.725 --> 17:00.286
No, no, no.

17:00.306 --> 17:02.068
The war didn't start until June of 50.

17:03.635 --> 17:05.679
Then I went in in 51.

17:07.563 --> 17:09.326
And you were on active duty how long?

17:09.507 --> 17:12.012
For three years, 11 months and 19 days.

17:14.196 --> 17:16.941
And then I came back in 55 and finished.

17:17.462 --> 17:19.787
How had A&M changed during that time?

17:20.358 --> 17:23.321
It really hadn't changed that much that I could notice.

17:23.782 --> 17:25.624
The only thing is I wasn't in the Corps then.

17:25.944 --> 17:37.637
I was over in Milner and I didn't go back in the Corps, which as hindsight always has, I made a mistake by not going back in the Corps.

17:38.718 --> 17:40.220
So you never had senior boots?

17:40.440 --> 17:43.463
No.

17:43.443 --> 17:44.144
Wasn't the boots.

17:44.204 --> 17:51.190
In fact, I already had two years up here before and then four years in the Navy.

17:51.650 --> 17:54.753
And if I'd have gone back in the Corps, I'd already had almost ten years.

17:57.636 --> 17:59.057
You could be cashing the checks.

17:59.077 --> 17:59.397
Right.

18:00.058 --> 18:01.479
So that was kind of a mistake.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.502
But anyway, it's all passed, so it's okay.

18:05.062 --> 18:11.088
Before you went off to join the Navy, did you and your buddies talk about that war and how it might affect you?

18:12.169 --> 18:12.589
Yeah.

18:13.177 --> 18:21.574
We talked about it some and wondered what we were going to do or if we were going to have to go, if it would be over by then.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.079
Another police action, you know.

18:24.359 --> 18:27.305
And we thought MacArthur would pretty well handle the program.

18:27.345 --> 18:28.968
He did pretty well the first time around.

18:29.449 --> 18:32.114
And so it may not bother us yet.

18:33.457 --> 18:35.421
And then our head yell eater, Job.

18:36.228 --> 18:37.129
A guy named Job.

18:37.810 --> 18:38.310
J-O-B-E?

18:38.911 --> 18:39.051
Uh-huh.

18:39.131 --> 18:41.994
Wasn't over there until the water got hot.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.095
He got blasted.

18:44.336 --> 18:47.639
And there's two stories.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.301
One is they didn't even find his body.

18:49.341 --> 18:52.304
Two weeks after the encounter, he went in.

18:52.344 --> 18:59.571
Or a week after that, after we'd won the place, they went in and couldn't find him.

18:59.591 --> 19:06.218
So we understand he's listed as an MIA because they haven't found him.

19:06.755 --> 19:07.656
But anyway.

19:08.196 --> 19:11.780
All right, now by that time you had been to Silver Taps.

19:13.562 --> 19:15.364
Do you remember your first Silver Taps?

19:16.145 --> 19:16.325
Yeah.

19:16.345 --> 19:17.186
What your feelings were?

19:17.206 --> 19:18.827
I remember all of them.

19:18.847 --> 19:26.796
I'd say all of them, but there's really no feeling like that because in those days when it was all mail, all the lights went out.

19:28.097 --> 19:29.859
And so at 10 o'clock the lights went out.

19:29.899 --> 19:33.943
We all left our dorm quietly and walked to the...

19:35.864 --> 20:05.770
academic building and stood there very reverend until the ceremony was over then we quietly walked back to our dorms and then the lights came on sometime thereafter you know 11 o'clock or so 10 30 11 but it was dead dark in those days of course they can't do that today with the girls you know but and did you ever hear of any kind of prank or stunt or anything else

20:07.285 --> 20:08.226
On a silver taps night?

20:08.266 --> 20:09.688
No, you never heard a word.

20:10.349 --> 20:11.471
I never have either, thank goodness.

20:11.491 --> 20:12.272
Never heard a word.

20:13.173 --> 20:16.117
I mean, everybody really had respect for that.

20:16.358 --> 20:17.980
I mean, they wouldn't talk to each other walking.

20:18.861 --> 20:21.285
Somebody stumbled and fell, it's your fault.

20:22.807 --> 20:30.277
And it happened seldom enough that usually you knew who the person was, didn't you?

20:30.297 --> 20:33.902
Yeah, well, in those days, you knew quite a lot more kids than today.

20:34.283 --> 20:34.423
Mm-hmm.

20:35.028 --> 20:37.972
Because, you know, the average was probably 5,000 or 6,000.

20:39.354 --> 20:42.378
And here, well, you knew all of them in the dorm.

20:43.600 --> 20:49.868
I lived in Milner and knew all those kids in Milner, you know, when I came back.

20:49.908 --> 20:50.969
But you just know them all.

20:50.989 --> 20:52.712
You just get around to meet them.

20:52.732 --> 20:55.095
That's the...

20:58.670 --> 21:02.396
Did you go to Bonfire after you came back?

21:03.679 --> 21:03.819
Uh-huh.

21:03.839 --> 21:04.861
Did you work on Bonfire?

21:04.921 --> 21:05.181
Yes.

21:05.922 --> 21:13.916
I just got myself in as a safety officer as opposed to going out and cutting there.

21:13.936 --> 21:14.777
Now, what does that mean?

21:14.798 --> 21:15.759
What was a safety officer?

21:15.779 --> 21:20.948
Oh, I just went around to stack some and explained to them about...

21:22.430 --> 21:24.192
how they ought to act at the site.

21:24.373 --> 21:25.434
Still on the drill field.

21:25.594 --> 21:25.835
Yeah.

21:26.976 --> 21:27.717
But I didn't.

21:27.737 --> 21:29.880
And they worked about how long on it?

21:29.900 --> 21:30.401
Oh, I don't know.

21:30.421 --> 21:30.621
Maybe.

21:30.881 --> 21:32.884
I don't think they worked as long as they work now.

21:33.044 --> 21:33.505
Oh, no.

21:35.848 --> 21:36.589
It wasn't very long.

21:36.949 --> 21:37.610
What about Mustard?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.212
Did you go to Mustard as a student?

21:39.232 --> 21:40.354
Went to Mustard as a student.

21:40.915 --> 21:41.215
Where?

21:43.898 --> 21:44.720
Where did they have it?

21:50.427 --> 21:51.829
I forgot where we went.

21:54.948 --> 21:55.990
I can't remember where I went.

21:56.010 --> 21:59.497
I think it was sometimes on the steps.

21:59.517 --> 22:02.503
Oh, it was on the steps out at the system building.

22:02.523 --> 22:03.365
Or the system building.

22:03.385 --> 22:05.429
Yeah, that's where we went.

22:05.449 --> 22:13.665
And then when I first got here, they had it two or three times on the MSC steps in 60, 61.

22:13.645 --> 22:17.149
I think we went over at the system building probably.

22:17.610 --> 22:21.575
What did, at that time, what did muster mean to you and your buddies?

22:22.796 --> 22:23.257
What was it?

22:23.277 --> 22:25.139
It didn't really mean much at that time.

22:25.540 --> 22:38.235
I mean, you know, because we weren't really, didn't have a real concept of, that it was about our fallen comrades and all that like it does after we got out of

22:38.519 --> 22:39.601
Korea and all, you know.

22:39.621 --> 22:42.808
When you came back from Navy duty, did it seem different?

22:42.988 --> 22:44.211
Yeah, it seemed a lot different then.

22:47.297 --> 22:54.111
Then you could relate to the, to Corregidor, not as bad, but you could relate to.

22:57.258 --> 22:59.683
And you bought your senior ring and what?

23:02.161 --> 23:03.622
So you're in the class of what?

23:03.642 --> 23:04.063
52.

23:04.103 --> 23:05.104
52.

23:05.184 --> 23:12.071
See, I held my class of 52 when I started because that's my age group, and I met most of my partners in that year.

23:12.471 --> 23:15.214
But you came back and you got your degree.

23:15.234 --> 23:15.875
57.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.116
57.

23:17.156 --> 23:19.799
So when did you buy your ring?

23:19.819 --> 23:25.544
I think I got it in December or August of 57, something like that, December.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.346
Remember what it cost?

23:27.386 --> 23:28.287
$27.50.

23:29.650 --> 23:35.739
And by this time, you and the GI Bill are paying... Yeah, we were getting $110 a month, which paid everything.

23:36.600 --> 23:36.941
Oh, okay.

23:36.961 --> 23:38.403
And the money to spare, I'm telling you.

23:38.423 --> 23:39.705
What kind of car did you have by then?

23:40.486 --> 23:52.544
I had bought a 1950 Buick Special from my father when I was still in the service, and I drove it back to San Diego my last year out there, I guess.

23:52.604 --> 23:53.886
And then when I came back...

23:55.587 --> 23:58.730
I drove it back, of course, and then I kept it while I was up here.

24:01.393 --> 24:02.654
Why did you come back to A&M?

24:02.694 --> 24:06.137
Why didn't you go somewhere else?

24:06.157 --> 24:10.802
Well, turn that off and I'll tell you.

24:11.903 --> 24:16.428
No, and he put me on probation, and it was after the first semester I was off.

24:17.208 --> 24:18.349
Did you make better grades?

24:18.730 --> 24:22.033
Oh, I didn't make under a B average after I came back.

24:22.908 --> 24:25.250
But it was so easy.

24:25.771 --> 24:26.912
I knew what I was here for.

24:28.293 --> 24:40.085
And studying, I'd go into quizzes or finals with a smile on my face and sit down and casually take the test.

24:40.205 --> 24:42.867
And they were so easy, you know.

24:42.887 --> 24:45.650
And I didn't have under, I graduated with a 1.7.

24:45.970 --> 24:49.274
No, with a 1.4, I think, because of some of my grades prior to that.

24:49.294 --> 24:50.815
And today, we'd add a point to that.

24:51.155 --> 24:52.797
Yeah.

24:54.633 --> 24:57.497
Because of the first two years.

24:59.701 --> 25:02.125
But I had great grades when I came back.

25:02.145 --> 25:06.151
You know, I didn't have any problem at all, passing or getting out.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.575
But anyway, it was, it's a different thing.

25:08.615 --> 25:11.940
Like the veterans, when they came back, you know, they were here to study.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.062
They knew what they were doing.

25:13.683 --> 25:14.924
So the curve went to plot.

25:14.944 --> 25:16.607
Now, did you, where did you serve in the Navy?

25:18.038 --> 25:23.781
I was in Carpus for a couple of years, and then the other two years I was on a seaplane tender and an aircraft carrier.

25:23.801 --> 25:24.063
Where?

25:24.765 --> 25:25.408
In the Pacific.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.412
In the Pacific.

25:26.510 --> 25:29.994
Did y'all go into, well, the Korean War was over by then, I guess.

25:30.134 --> 25:30.595
No.

25:30.615 --> 25:32.457
Oh, were y'all in that area?

25:32.497 --> 25:32.777
Yes.

25:33.718 --> 25:37.983
We were, the seaplane tender I was on was attached to the Atomic Energy Commission.

25:38.884 --> 25:46.272
So we were over, and we were talking bikini in 53, with the big bombs, with the big deals, the H-bomb.

25:47.193 --> 25:50.297
So we were sitting just off the coast and all that.

25:50.337 --> 25:53.040
We took the scientists and the big stuff.

25:53.020 --> 25:55.142
heavy stuff with us on our ship.

25:58.665 --> 26:03.710
Then I spent my last six months on a carrier because Curtis was going back someplace.

26:03.750 --> 26:04.650
I don't know where it was going.

26:05.591 --> 26:07.793
So I got transferred off of that onto a carrier.

26:09.155 --> 26:11.497
Why is an Aggie ring special?

26:13.659 --> 26:16.761
Well, I think it's special because it's mine.

26:18.103 --> 26:20.305
Because I earned it.

26:20.325 --> 26:23.027
Got my name in it.

26:24.931 --> 26:28.555
I think the real reason it's special is because you can't get it but one place.

26:29.756 --> 26:30.457
And that's right here.

26:31.919 --> 26:34.502
And you have to have X grades, X hours.

26:34.522 --> 26:36.424
You have to have what it takes to get it.

26:37.485 --> 26:39.067
And you can't buy it in a jewelry store.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.890
You can't buy it any place else but right here.

26:42.991 --> 26:45.854
And I think that's why it's so special.

26:46.155 --> 26:49.318
Plus, it's recognizable by everybody in the country.

26:49.788 --> 26:53.673
So anywhere you are in an elevator, anywhere they know where you went to school.

26:53.733 --> 26:56.696
Do you have any good Aggie ring stories?

27:00.401 --> 27:06.148
Where somebody recognized it on the other side of the world, or you lost it and somebody returned it?

27:06.168 --> 27:07.289
No, I don't have that.

27:07.410 --> 27:10.193
I was trying to think of somebody.

27:12.333 --> 27:18.885
Of course, I've been a lot of places where I can't think of just where they are, but it's amazing where people turn up.

27:20.288 --> 27:25.037
I just can't think offhand.

27:25.358 --> 27:32.451
The best one that Ray Bowen, one of the best ones Ray Bowen told me, he had been, he was an MIT graduate student, I mean Caltech graduate student.

27:32.920 --> 27:37.969
going with two German buddies from Heidelberg to Venice on the train.

27:38.871 --> 27:46.204
And here's a lady, somewhat older than he, reading the paper across from him, and she puts the paper down and says, is that an Aggie ring?

27:46.565 --> 27:47.186
Well, yes, ma'am.

27:47.326 --> 27:48.027
You go to Texas A&M?

27:48.067 --> 27:48.548
Yes, ma'am.

27:49.630 --> 27:50.592
How did you recognize it?

27:51.753 --> 27:56.621
She said, well, my husband went to A&M.

27:57.583 --> 27:59.806
I don't know whether you've met him or not.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.389
I'm Mrs. H.B.

28:01.449 --> 28:02.010
Zachary.

28:02.030 --> 28:02.551
Oh, really?

28:03.352 --> 28:06.598
And he told her, yes, he'd heard of her husband.

28:06.618 --> 28:13.369
All right, so did you, the year you graduated, did you even go see Final Review?

28:15.032 --> 28:16.013
Did you walk out there?

28:16.915 --> 28:17.676
I think I did.

28:18.078 --> 28:19.039
Yeah, I walked out there.

28:19.059 --> 28:22.104
I mean, the Corps is still a big time.

28:22.184 --> 28:25.088
We're giving a Corps scholarship right now, a Silverall Scholarship.

28:25.168 --> 28:36.183
And our class is going to end up giving our 50th reunion gift is probably going to be to the Corps.

28:36.203 --> 28:39.427
So everybody and I, we're just still in that group.

28:40.228 --> 28:40.349
Oh.

28:40.389 --> 28:44.254
You know, it's... Commencement was held where?

28:46.664 --> 28:47.305
At Cebiza?

28:47.685 --> 28:49.608
I mean, at Guyon?

28:50.469 --> 28:51.090
Yeah, it was.

28:51.391 --> 28:51.711
Okay.

28:51.731 --> 28:52.853
Yeah.

28:52.933 --> 28:56.197
What were your feelings as you were about to graduate?

28:56.237 --> 28:58.360
They were pretty good.

29:01.385 --> 29:03.528
Knowing we were going to get out of school and get back to work.

29:03.548 --> 29:04.249
Did the family come up?

29:05.030 --> 29:05.250
Yes.

29:05.430 --> 29:07.613
My mother came up, stayed in La Salle Hotel.

29:10.557 --> 29:11.258
That's what she did.

29:11.599 --> 29:12.781
My daddy was dead by then.

29:12.821 --> 29:13.802
He died in August.

29:14.508 --> 29:16.911
before that January graduation.

29:18.093 --> 29:20.697
But anyway, my mother came up and stayed in the LaSalle Hotel.

29:21.738 --> 29:23.421
And so that was good.

29:24.122 --> 29:27.066
And was the speaker a memorable person?

29:28.588 --> 29:29.249
I don't remember.

29:29.289 --> 29:30.250
Most of us don't remember.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.272
No, I don't.

29:32.694 --> 29:36.499
And was every name called, every hand shaken?

29:37.357 --> 29:37.999
That was done.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.082
Is that important?

29:39.544 --> 29:40.627
Oh, yeah.

29:40.647 --> 29:41.169
I think it is.

29:41.671 --> 29:42.092
I do, too.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.817
I think everybody ought to know.

29:43.837 --> 29:50.117
And I think it's the time you spend here and the work you do, I think it's important for the president to shake your hand.

29:50.367 --> 29:55.993
How well did you feel A&M had prepared you for the future?

29:57.475 --> 29:59.477
Well, I thought very well, you know.

30:00.478 --> 30:07.445
Looking back now on all of your professional career since then, what did you learn at Texas A&M?

30:07.485 --> 30:08.887
That's the most important question of the day.

30:08.947 --> 30:14.012
What did you learn at Texas A&M?

30:16.085 --> 30:24.057
Well, you learn how to research, study problems.

30:24.357 --> 30:25.218
You learn how to work.

30:25.439 --> 30:37.116
You learn how to take a situation and organize it and get to the end to where you can have an answer to the problem.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.882
And you learn how to get along with people.

30:41.342 --> 30:42.484
You learn how to meet people.

30:43.666 --> 30:44.607
You learn...

30:46.173 --> 30:49.560
which is really an asset.

30:49.880 --> 31:03.929
You learn how to laugh at yourself, which is another real asset that a lot of people don't understand because your paddnas up here will rag you about this or that, so you have to laugh at yourself because you can't fight the world.

31:05.832 --> 31:07.135
So it's...

31:09.967 --> 31:18.441
and you learn how to give and take with people, because you have to up here, whether you're in the Corps or not.
