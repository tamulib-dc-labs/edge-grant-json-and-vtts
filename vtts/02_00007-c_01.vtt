00:02.393 --> 00:22.404
As a freshman, and that's my understanding, I was number one in the class at mid-semester, and I was still in the top ten percent at the end of the semester, and which meant that I was uncertain about where I would fit into the big scheme of things and made a big effort.

00:23.145 --> 00:28.654
And after that I was, I did well, I was not in that category.

00:30.659 --> 00:42.632
But in retrospect, I was very well trained or educated, and I think that the other Aggies were very well educated.

00:42.652 --> 00:50.942
We were not anywhere near in trouble ever, let's put it that way.

00:54.065 --> 00:57.409
Using that theme, what were the key factors

00:58.469 --> 01:23.042
in this preparation what did A&M do right with its student body in those years well first of all you had a lot of attention from people who were professors it's my understanding that with the great increase in size of the university so much is delegated to teaching assistants and so forth but we were taught by professors

01:23.022 --> 01:31.800
And in chemistry lab, there might be a student teaching assistant.

01:32.822 --> 01:41.419
But even there, the professor would be walking through, and if you had something to say to him or ask him, he would be available for you.

01:41.399 --> 01:50.410
But we were taught entirely, I mean whether it was freshman English or anything, and I spoke of, for example, history.

01:50.671 --> 02:03.407
Ralph Steen taught me Texas history, and we received a lot of attention.

02:04.366 --> 02:18.570
We did have big lectures in the, you know, 200 students in the chemistry lecture room or something in freshman chemistry, but after that we were in a small room with a man who had been teaching for 20 years.

02:18.710 --> 02:28.146
And that was true of English classes and history.

02:29.206 --> 02:30.628
foreign languages.

02:30.648 --> 02:34.994
I mean, these were not big classes, and a lot of attention from the professors.

02:37.157 --> 02:58.167
The other thing was, at least in the sciences, in biology in particular, in chemistry, and physics too, I guess, your grade reflected what you were doing.

03:00.678 --> 03:04.626
People were not worried about diversity or gender or anything.

03:04.646 --> 03:05.988
You just got what you got.

03:07.591 --> 03:13.543
And there was not a lot of remedial activity going on.

03:13.583 --> 03:16.368
I mean, you know, you just performed when you were supposed to.

03:17.330 --> 03:22.500
And I think that particularly helped us in medical school because we had been

03:22.480 --> 03:30.454
our effortability had been developed by the time we got to Galveston.

03:30.934 --> 03:33.739
And incidentally, I went to the University of Texas to go around in Baylor.

03:35.101 --> 03:37.225
Oh, you got the letter that you had been accepted.

03:37.245 --> 03:39.148
Oh, I see.

03:39.489 --> 03:40.851
My dad made that decision.

03:40.871 --> 03:42.875
He said, you will go to the University of Texas.

03:42.975 --> 03:43.616
That was his.

03:44.277 --> 03:47.362
Well, in those days, there was a cost differential too, wasn't there?

03:47.382 --> 03:47.863
Yeah.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.124
Do you remember what, for trivia, do you remember what a year in medical school cost?

03:52.145 --> 03:53.746
Oh, practically nothing at the state school.

03:54.507 --> 03:58.212
We had, well, specifically $40 a semester.

03:59.553 --> 04:10.146
And, you know, A&M at that time, I'm not talking about the room and board, it ran up to about $2.50 a semester, but your entry fee at A&M was $25.

04:10.527 --> 04:13.430
And that took care of everything, you know.

04:15.373 --> 04:17.395
When you got to the medical school?

04:17.813 --> 04:25.330
Did it matter that you had been at Texas A&M and the way people reacted to you, treated you?

04:25.350 --> 04:28.216
Oh, well, of course, everybody, you were an Aggie or something like that.

04:28.236 --> 04:28.918
You were teased about it.

04:29.098 --> 04:29.920
Yeah, you get teased a little bit.

04:29.940 --> 04:34.911
But what did the, what do you think the medical faculty, did they have any?

04:36.157 --> 04:38.960
Most of them didn't matter much.

04:39.000 --> 04:51.313
The professor of biochemistry, who fortunately was partly retired, he was not the department head, but he apparently didn't like A&M students.

04:51.353 --> 05:00.343
I can remember Dr. Grant, who was an older doctor here when I came to practice, saying that was true when he was a student, you know.

05:00.363 --> 05:04.527
And so with Dr. Hendricks, if he wandered down the

05:04.507 --> 05:11.956
in the laboratory and stopped at your desk, you tried your best not to let him know you'd been to A&M.

05:11.976 --> 05:14.999
But except for that, there was no, nothing.

05:17.322 --> 05:19.965
All right, three questions left.

05:19.985 --> 05:26.953
First of those, what did it mean to you, what has it meant to you that you went to Texas A&M?

05:27.874 --> 05:33.180
What had... Well,

05:35.506 --> 05:36.051
Uh...

05:37.210 --> 05:40.274
Well, I'm very proud to have been to A&M.

05:40.294 --> 05:41.416
That's the first thing.

05:44.400 --> 06:01.104
And in some ways, probably my feeling about A&M is one of a lifelong identification, more than that of four years, having grown up on the campus.

06:02.225 --> 06:07.032
And my dad was at A&M for 35 years.

06:07.012 --> 06:18.447
And his brother, who was a graduate of A&M, came from Tennessee to take veterinary medicine.

06:18.468 --> 06:27.320
And incidentally, my children have gone to A&M, and my brother went to A&M two years before he went to Annapolis.

06:28.842 --> 06:32.867
And even at the grand parental level,

06:32.847 --> 06:45.408
The brother of one grandfather took premed at NM before going to Tulane in 1894 or five or something.

06:45.428 --> 06:54.383
And the interesting thing is that part of my dad's family had come from Tennessee to Texas before the Civil War.

06:55.763 --> 07:04.828
And one of my grandfather's Tennessee first cousins was in the first class radio.

07:06.732 --> 07:11.317
Anyway, I've always just sort of felt part of A&M.

07:12.899 --> 07:24.812
If a person would come here, things like young practice and all that stuff would be so much more his feeling about A&M.

07:24.852 --> 07:29.837
For me, it is a feeling, but it's part of the whole picture.

07:29.817 --> 07:34.826
What if someone were to give you a million dollar check now, only one condition.

07:35.528 --> 07:40.116
You must give it to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what it would be used for.

07:41.158 --> 07:44.465
What would it be?

07:44.485 --> 07:51.117
Well, I've been somewhat identified with the med school, and so I would probably

07:52.717 --> 08:03.192
I think what takes $500,000 to endow a chair, I would probably endow one chair, and then the rest of it would go to student scholarships, I think.

08:04.094 --> 08:06.177
And on what basis would those be awarded?

08:08.039 --> 08:13.968
Of course, they would be president-type scholarships of that size.

08:13.988 --> 08:21.559
And I think I would...

08:22.298 --> 08:23.180
Well, I don't know.

08:23.260 --> 08:27.889
I think I would let the university make that decision.

08:28.510 --> 08:33.060
Say, with that much money, there would be, what, four or five scholarships in addition to the chair.

08:33.681 --> 08:39.733
I think I'd set one aside to not be given until a person was a junior.

08:40.540 --> 08:49.211
And a person who had shown great increase in aptitude would get that scholarship.

08:49.231 --> 08:54.918
I've often thought that's a kind of a forgotten part.

08:54.938 --> 09:00.985
Here is someone who comes in here and doesn't realize they have this better potential.

09:02.287 --> 09:02.687
Yeah.

09:02.707 --> 09:05.130
It would be an encouragement.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.601
Okay, then the last question follows this.

09:07.621 --> 09:10.615
What feelings do you have in your heart for A&M today?

09:11.708 --> 09:12.830
I like A&M today.

09:14.853 --> 09:21.883
Actually, since I've retired, I've been working on a volunteer basis in the leadership and humanities programs.

09:23.065 --> 09:27.952
This means one day a week in the fall semester.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.479
I've been very impressed with the students.

09:32.980 --> 09:39.690
I like their positive kids.

09:39.670 --> 09:44.041
It's a very stimulating environment.

09:44.061 --> 09:56.532
In fact, I thought my mother and dad lived to be 88 and 93 respectively and died of cancer problems, not heart or

09:56.512 --> 10:22.502
old age problems, but I've always thought that the stimulus they had from being with younger people, and I might add it continued, because even though these people would come back who were dad's athletes or who dad had known first or something, they had a continuing contact with people, a generation younger than they were.

10:22.482 --> 10:32.139
throughout their lives, and it really was a, I think, made their older years so much more positive and with it, too, you know.

10:34.984 --> 10:37.048
Let's quit with that.
