00:02.714 --> 00:13.027
Those grandchildren, what perception do you get from them of how they feel about A&M?

00:13.227 --> 00:32.350
One of the changes made back in the 60s was also to become more selective in admission requirements.

00:34.152 --> 00:40.201
Do you remember any discussions about whether or not that was good policy back in the 60's?

00:41.223 --> 00:47.512
I thought it was excellent policy.

00:47.532 --> 00:58.388
There was a good bit of discussion in the association.

00:59.650 --> 01:07.967
If the standards had been that, when I got here, I wouldn't have got to go away anymore.

01:07.987 --> 01:10.191
And there's some merit to that.

01:10.211 --> 01:11.754
I think A&M's handled that very well.

01:13.618 --> 01:16.123
We've upped the standards, we've tried to

01:16.964 --> 01:22.212
open the door for those people who would really get with it.

01:23.754 --> 01:27.159
The summer program and all.

01:27.179 --> 01:30.263
The guy had this great deal of devotion.

01:30.444 --> 01:33.528
He was a late bloomer.

01:33.548 --> 01:34.790
They've been in unity now.

01:34.810 --> 01:37.774
But it has up the standards, no question.

01:37.794 --> 01:41.019
We have a higher academic rating than we have.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.165
And also,

01:45.989 --> 01:54.561
We're now, what, the fourth largest university in the country.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.103
The fact is, I think, I read a newspaper this morning.

01:56.123 --> 01:57.465
Texas is, they're number one.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.428
Number one, Iowa State's second.

02:04.195 --> 02:10.484
That would be in the paper this morning.

02:10.824 --> 02:14.730
It's right, Arizona State is third, and then it's fourth.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.615
Michigan State is fifth.

02:18.275 --> 02:25.283
They're all in the 40,000s, in Texas, 48, 43 something.

02:25.383 --> 02:34.233
And there was a realization I think on the part of everyone that growth might just overwhelm us.

02:34.253 --> 02:44.785
That's one of my responses is if we were to have open admissions, where do we put everyone and are we doing anyone a favor

02:45.355 --> 03:06.823
if we admit a student that we know is almost certain to flunk out.

03:07.732 --> 03:10.216
more or less than the area we live now.

03:10.236 --> 03:16.485
For many years, I thought the ideal role for him would be 35 to 45.

03:16.505 --> 03:17.266
I'm on your side.

03:18.728 --> 03:20.070
And I still believe that.

03:20.090 --> 03:20.771
I do too.

03:20.791 --> 03:23.194
I still think we carry 200 people in there.

03:23.875 --> 03:28.542
And I think the University of Texas will carry 200 people in there.

03:28.562 --> 03:28.742
I do too.

03:28.762 --> 03:33.309
But here are state-supported schools, at least part of state-supported.

03:33.329 --> 03:36.253
I think most people don't realize just how little state-supported they are now.

03:37.077 --> 03:51.097
but as long as one of the flagships takes school, the enrollment will continue to be able to take this issue.

03:51.117 --> 04:02.494
The curriculum, do you have any areas where you think A&M today

04:04.533 --> 04:12.811
its success is greater as the public sees us, that we're better at this than we are with that.

04:13.353 --> 04:15.578
As far as you know, which areas does A&M?

04:17.161 --> 04:24.297
Well, I think we're generally considered best in the

04:26.251 --> 04:29.495
and the engineering areas.

04:30.336 --> 04:37.245
I think we're gaining promise in the business field.

04:37.265 --> 04:47.078
And, uh, while liberal arts, in my opinion, is moving along with great strides, I don't think

04:48.526 --> 05:01.284
a lot of people are not familiar with it, that it's recognized very well.

05:01.304 --> 05:02.165
I think you're correct.

05:02.185 --> 05:05.751
I think you're correct.

05:05.771 --> 05:12.640
And there are other problems that are tied to, like the Sea Grant border, the geosciences, and all of those things that pretty well received.

05:12.660 --> 05:17.267
A lot of that's perceived in the same way as the engineering whole law.

05:18.361 --> 05:32.381
Let's see, do you, in looking back, can you think of any decisions that A&M did not make, but it now, we can see that maybe it should have made?

05:33.343 --> 05:48.064
Well, one of the things I look back on, when we, when we let John talk about the system,

05:48.398 --> 05:49.960
You mean Arlington?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.842
I mean, I'm sorry, Arlington.

05:51.862 --> 05:54.125
We let Arlington slip out of the system.

05:54.205 --> 05:56.548
That, in my opinion, was a mistake.

05:56.568 --> 05:59.151
Do you have any idea as to why that was done?

06:02.655 --> 06:07.161
I wasn't involved in it personally.

06:07.181 --> 06:16.212
I've been told that some of the results are just maybe personal ambushes, as far as speaking.

06:19.516 --> 06:28.849
and in an effort to consolidate the funding and support that the legislation was given into Texas A.D.

06:28.869 --> 06:33.956
University, which was probably a good decision from that standpoint.

06:34.636 --> 06:40.544
But politically, I think it was a bad mistake for that art to get out of the system.

06:40.564 --> 06:43.368
Frank Irwin was very happy with that, I think.

06:43.388 --> 06:48.375
He must have danced with me.

06:49.098 --> 06:59.113
Alright, can you think of any other omissions or commissions that we now might wish we could have rethought?

07:00.935 --> 07:10.930
Really that would have always been personal in my mind when I think of something we should have done.

07:10.950 --> 07:17.940
Obviously through the years, hindsight says sure, we didn't do too well here, but I don't think anything

07:18.359 --> 07:32.955
Are there any administrators since Rudder and Williams that you would rate real highly?

07:32.975 --> 07:36.279
Not going to ask the negative.

07:36.299 --> 07:42.966
Bowen, what do you think are his strengths?

07:47.249 --> 07:55.639
I think he's a play in the head guy.

07:55.659 --> 08:12.578
I think he tries to move ahead, play in the head, and instead of having the problems, now he's got a position where instead of having to deal with putting out fires, he's able to move ahead on.

08:12.598 --> 08:16.783
So many of other presidents, for one reason or another, spent all that time putting out brush fires.

08:17.506 --> 08:22.052
instead of moving along, too busy.

08:22.933 --> 08:23.935
But not brush marks.

08:23.955 --> 08:28.501
You can't score any touchdowns if you're having to play defense.

08:28.701 --> 08:29.702
That's right.

08:29.722 --> 08:32.506
And we've played a lot of defense.

08:33.087 --> 08:37.813
And there for a while, I think that we've played a lot of defense.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.235
Always something happens.

08:39.255 --> 08:40.978
These people are always ready to jump on it.

08:41.759 --> 08:47.226
And I think that the fact that Dr. Moore had been

08:47.965 --> 09:09.130
and has gone out there and sought the media and asked them to come and give and look at him and all of them standing behind the fences and say, don't let that media guy get in there because he's going to write a bad story about us.

09:09.582 --> 09:20.673
I think the best thing to say about it is that great article that came out.

09:20.693 --> 09:24.756
That writer admitted and said he wouldn't pay them.

09:24.776 --> 09:29.761
I think he needs to write himself a nice patent, negative one.

09:29.781 --> 09:32.023
He came away and wrote the best article to have been written.

09:32.123 --> 09:33.024
Oh, yes.

09:34.686 --> 09:35.927
That article was worth

09:36.683 --> 09:38.606
an uncountable amount of money.

09:38.766 --> 09:57.354
But that was largely due to Ray Bowen's open attitude and also his profession.

09:57.374 --> 10:05.526
If you run into Bowen, tell him that last part because Jim Ashlock, who has that job,

10:05.978 --> 10:17.799
under a contract that that contract is ending in next August and there's a decision to be made as to whether or not to go outside or to keep him.

10:17.819 --> 10:20.583
So if you have any opinion, tell Bowen.

10:21.004 --> 10:27.956
Well, my opinion is that I agree with you.

10:27.976 --> 10:29.539
I agree with you.

10:30.127 --> 10:33.731
Not very many brush fires.

10:33.751 --> 10:37.735
And the ones up there have been put out real quick.

10:37.755 --> 10:45.303
And of course, a lot of that credit belongs to Dr. Boyd himself, but some of it belongs to the next one.

10:45.323 --> 10:48.766
All right, how did the Private Enterprise Research Center come into being?

10:57.916 --> 10:59.037
Well, you may recall,

10:59.995 --> 11:27.994
uh, during the 60s and early 70s, all the, uh, still liberal, still takeovers of universities, they were, uh, uh, really, uh, coming in and getting into areas where the, uh, all the universities were coming up with not the liberal ideas.

11:28.463 --> 11:51.095
what really approach the socialistic type system that they're trying to install.

11:51.115 --> 11:56.142
And there was just a dark places where good conservative thinking could either be expressed.

11:56.459 --> 12:03.949
even in the academic field.

12:03.969 --> 12:26.078
And a number of us felt that A&M was solid enough conservative that we would be the ones to go forward with some of these mandates in the legislature passed that private employers and that leadership

12:26.530 --> 12:50.601
And a few things like that, we taught the schools.

12:50.621 --> 12:52.183
And who's going to do it?

12:52.203 --> 12:53.204
So the field grants help in the office department.

12:53.224 --> 12:54.546
We were able to convince people that we set up the three-up class.

12:54.998 --> 13:22.031
that it had the possibility of at least making plenty of funerals to let all the ideas be espoused in the university.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.132
And with Bill's help, the Lord of the West Foundation,

13:23.703 --> 13:32.811
And I formed a food association which made a horse.

13:32.831 --> 13:43.881
The president at that time was very scared of funding because of the Board of Regents and they were very enthusiastic to back the formation of the time.

13:43.901 --> 13:47.864
Now were you the lead horse in that caravan?

13:48.925 --> 13:52.528
Some people say so, but we would know a lot of football.

13:52.778 --> 13:54.580
All right, who were your key allies?

13:56.403 --> 13:57.324
You mentioned Phil.

13:57.384 --> 14:13.887
Yeah, Phil and Mary Compson and the association, Buck Graham, my name is Houston, pushing hard on it.

14:13.907 --> 14:16.931
And we had the general backing of the former students association.

14:16.951 --> 14:20.676
Because Phil was not yet in the Senate, he was in the House.

14:21.179 --> 14:23.561
Oh, oh, okay.

14:44.659 --> 14:45.259
He was here at the University.

14:45.279 --> 14:45.460
Oh, okay.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.440
He was an economics professor at the University.

14:46.460 --> 14:46.560
Okay.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.643
And then, through the friendships, the West Foundation, probably partially who was the foundation, the West Foundation, who had a great interest in this.

14:49.663 --> 14:50.764
I still think we need to get them up there in some way.

14:51.065 --> 14:52.246
Who's that?

14:52.506 --> 14:53.728
Bill Lawyer.

14:54.789 --> 14:58.852
Oh, yes.

14:58.872 --> 15:04.157
And his wife, Martin Westbrook.

15:04.177 --> 15:04.578
Very, very critical.

15:04.598 --> 15:06.139
They might only support it if they got other people to support it.

15:06.159 --> 15:07.360
In the early days, it was getting that support.

15:07.380 --> 15:13.706
The Fasco Foundation came forward.

15:13.726 --> 15:20.633
Now, who was the first executive director, I'll call it, or president, or...

15:21.035 --> 15:28.102
The faculty, who was the first faculty leader of the private enterprise?

15:28.122 --> 15:32.066
See, there were five, five teams.

15:32.086 --> 15:35.330
Okay.

15:35.910 --> 15:39.254
But who had the task then that Tom Savings has now?

15:39.915 --> 15:41.316
Who started, who was the first?

15:42.798 --> 15:45.220
The first didn't work.

15:46.060 --> 15:48.504
I didn't look at the archives and see who it was.

15:48.525 --> 15:50.448
Okay, well then who's the first one and where it worked?

15:50.468 --> 15:59.525
Then we got Dr. Brown.

15:59.545 --> 16:01.909
He was 85.

16:02.682 --> 16:04.848
just a great guy.

16:04.868 --> 16:07.475
So, you know, you don't look old.

16:07.495 --> 16:08.878
And I can't think of his name.

16:09.099 --> 16:12.348
And I'm embarrassed now, but we were great friends.

16:12.408 --> 16:18.143
But he carried the thing beautifully.

16:18.815 --> 16:42.605
got us involved with the Heritage Foundation and he was well thought of all through that area and did a marvelous job.

16:42.625 --> 16:43.966
And then Tom, when he retired, Tom came on and Tom did a great job.

16:43.986 --> 16:45.468
Now, I'm really proud of the President and President of the United States.

16:45.488 --> 16:47.050
Most people don't realize it, but we have more input on what's going to happen

16:47.468 --> 16:55.437
Social Security, Medicare, than almost any other foundation in the country.

16:55.498 --> 17:08.112
We're peanuts, size-wise, and economic strength-wise, to Heritage and Kato and some of the others.

17:08.133 --> 17:09.754
But we're in a leadership position right now.

17:10.235 --> 17:14.260
And that comes to the back of how we got started.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.003
Phil Graham's getting us up there.

17:17.354 --> 17:34.571
and Tom and our staff and our people are coming up with good ideas to get some research.

17:34.591 --> 17:35.292
We really need to expand effort.

17:35.312 --> 17:41.678
We need to get more support into the private and private research center.

17:41.698 --> 17:43.480
It has a lot more clients than you could ever expect an organization like that to have.

17:44.506 --> 17:47.490
Do you have any advice on how to make that expansion?

17:49.032 --> 17:52.878
I think about it a lot every week.

17:53.478 --> 17:59.547
I think some of it's going to come about now because of the prestige we're getting.

17:59.567 --> 18:02.130
We're already getting a lot more grants.

18:03.713 --> 18:11.323
And the Foundation has always been, if I'm proud of the President, you say Sunday, always been very careful.

18:12.181 --> 18:30.970
that anybody that gives us a grant has to sign up and say, here, we'll do this, we'll make this study, whatever it follows out, follows out.

18:30.990 --> 18:32.012
We don't pay any control of what's coming out here.

18:32.032 --> 18:32.653
And we lose a lot of grants.

18:32.673 --> 18:35.978
A lot of grant people don't want to know, but they want to know what's going to come out before you do the study.

18:37.696 --> 18:59.716
And I believe that everything that you have chaired, you have put yourself into with your energy and your resources.

19:01.338 --> 19:06.302
I think that's been one of your marks very much to your credit.

19:06.704 --> 19:09.227
Why have you been so devoted to A&M?

19:11.250 --> 19:16.576
Oh, I suppose I don't know where to go.

19:16.596 --> 19:29.712
I was a, you know, just a young man from a country town.

19:29.732 --> 19:34.618
And I actually, a little bit on the Ruffin side, you know, I learned leadership.

19:38.868 --> 19:55.589
is something that's an indefinable type thing that helps you all through your career, whether it's social or business.

19:57.091 --> 19:57.692
Anything changed me.

19:57.712 --> 20:02.297
At the final of the school, it didn't come to my school day again.

20:02.317 --> 20:03.559
I budget on my sophomore year as to be able to think about it.

20:08.078 --> 20:11.341
I like what A&M stood for.

20:11.361 --> 20:16.887
Got involved, and the more we get involved, the better it goes.

20:16.907 --> 20:29.440
And A&M, as you perceive today, A&M's values and attitudes, are they very different from what the values and attitudes were 50, 60 years ago?

20:29.500 --> 20:32.844
Not a lot, basically.

20:32.864 --> 20:37.849
We're still fine right down the road, and I'm very proud of that.

20:38.892 --> 20:45.919
Alien ship, so to speak, has followed the course that hasn't deviated a lot.

20:46.480 --> 20:55.149
That's what people are understanding, that you can depend on alien.

20:55.169 --> 21:00.194
It's not going to be jumping over here one day and jumping over there the next day.

21:00.214 --> 21:05.279
It's going to plow ahead and try to do a good job.

21:05.299 --> 21:05.740
I like that.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.161
That's good.

21:07.715 --> 21:09.518
That's good imagery, that's good symbolism.

21:10.339 --> 21:32.010
If we were today going to make a list of the events, the practices, in an A&M student's experience that build this feeling in their heart, what events, practices would you put on that list?

21:35.615 --> 21:36.777
That's one of the most...

21:37.212 --> 21:44.822
Difficult things are defined that I know of.

21:44.842 --> 22:00.603
But it's largely not a morale factor, where there is a perception and reality that alien people support each other.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.148
And if they deserve support.

22:04.887 --> 22:23.267
I'll give a break to any anger that I think wants to do the right thing.

22:25.029 --> 22:26.771
I get lots of calls from people who are just familiar with angership.

22:26.791 --> 22:26.891
Sure.

22:26.911 --> 22:28.112
I think I've got no medical, I can tell, I can smell it.

22:28.132 --> 22:32.397
And I think most of the people like that, so there's very little, there's a business that's just a moving angership.

22:33.153 --> 22:57.135
I think if somebody that's playing, they'll need some help, and they approach it right away, they need to get help from things.

22:57.155 --> 22:58.296
If they're going to act the wrong way, they don't get it.

22:58.316 --> 22:59.237
A lot of people think that they're just blind.

22:59.257 --> 22:59.797
Blindly support each other.

22:59.817 --> 23:00.097
That's not so.

23:00.117 --> 23:00.898
They support each other if they prefer.

23:01.098 --> 23:10.150
If we were to make a list of muster, and muster's important.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.574
It gives an opportunity for everybody to get together.

23:12.594 --> 23:14.857
Very important.

23:14.877 --> 23:27.835
Probably muster's probably the most significant tradition we have.

23:27.855 --> 23:29.637
A lot of mine is based on some stupid things.

23:30.157 --> 23:48.438
One, I'll tell you, I'll tell you one of my biggest disciplines.

23:48.458 --> 23:48.979
And I was on that program.

23:48.999 --> 23:51.061
I had, previous year, been dealing with the head of the four-point company, the real state operation.

23:51.081 --> 23:55.446
Took me to the University of Houston football.

23:55.466 --> 23:57.428
And there's a tight, hard game.

23:57.448 --> 23:59.050
Right in the middle of it, just like the Nebraska game.

24:00.312 --> 24:02.054
Things were winning up there.

24:02.734 --> 24:07.379
They had to just go out and play goodbye to Texas University.

24:07.399 --> 24:09.341
That chaps my butt.

24:09.361 --> 24:10.102
I agree with you.

24:10.122 --> 24:10.983
I agree with you.

24:11.163 --> 24:12.484
That is the stupidest thing.

24:13.105 --> 24:16.408
And when I was president, I got the student butt.

24:16.428 --> 24:18.230
Got them all done.

24:19.111 --> 24:21.773
And we decided we were going to quit that.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.755
And we were going to sing the proper verse.

24:26.138 --> 24:29.661
We published it in the football.

24:30.738 --> 24:34.904
All the freshmen were singing.

24:34.924 --> 24:35.645
Got to the game.

24:36.366 --> 24:37.928
Band struck up.

24:37.948 --> 24:39.791
Alumni drowned everybody out.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.231
Oh, fool.

24:40.251 --> 24:41.473
They buy the taxes.

24:41.493 --> 24:42.034
Oh, fool.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.757
Because I agree with you.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.802
We ought to save that one for that one game.

24:48.122 --> 24:48.422
Yeah.

24:48.963 --> 24:52.168
Well, one thing, I don't like to recognize the bastards that much.

24:52.188 --> 24:52.728
That's right.

24:52.748 --> 24:53.149
That's right.

24:53.169 --> 24:53.590
It's stupid.

24:53.790 --> 24:54.291
That's right.

24:54.311 --> 24:55.132
It's still stupid.

24:55.152 --> 24:55.472
It is.

24:55.753 --> 24:56.393
It is.

24:56.413 --> 24:58.657
It's the one thing that's disappointing.

24:58.677 --> 24:59.698
I thought I had got it done.

25:00.488 --> 25:06.677
I've got to say the stupid buddy was perceptive enough that that was the only thing to do.

25:07.758 --> 25:19.996
And we actually got it where they printed the words for the verse and it was a really new rhythm, you know, and urged everybody to do it.

25:20.056 --> 25:22.419
Of course, the alumni came to the program, they didn't really read anything in the program.

25:22.439 --> 25:28.588
The band started that when they just drowned out the stupid buddy in me.

25:28.771 --> 25:33.437
That was disappointing because I thought that we finally got such enough to take care of that.

25:33.457 --> 25:36.101
And I'll never believe that's the right thing to do.

25:36.121 --> 25:38.123
The fact is I got so disgusted.

25:38.584 --> 25:42.669
We were right there in the fourth quarter and Nebraska made that second touchdown.

25:43.070 --> 25:44.712
We were trying to defend anything.

25:44.732 --> 25:48.497
Damn if the band didn't strike up, goodbye to Texas University.

25:48.517 --> 25:50.399
Man, we needed to be goodbye to Nebraska.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.701
That's right.

25:53.143 --> 25:55.586
And I thought, man, that's stupid.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.390
And he turned to me and said,

25:58.572 --> 26:03.096
I thought y'all were playing at the University of Houston then.

26:03.117 --> 26:04.638
What's this good part of Texas business?

26:05.459 --> 26:07.681
And I had to try to explain to him this.

26:07.701 --> 26:09.963
He never did even come close to understanding it.

26:09.983 --> 26:12.005
That's right.

26:12.025 --> 26:18.231
All right, as you look at A&M today, what are the parts of A&M that you care most about?

26:22.195 --> 26:23.837
The parts that are dearest to your heart.

26:28.778 --> 26:31.102
Well, obviously it ought to be a student body.

26:33.746 --> 26:35.369
The whole student body?

26:35.389 --> 26:37.091
Yeah, it's an exceptional student body.

26:37.572 --> 26:49.892
Would it matter if somebody came to you and asked you, would you help us with some students who are majoring in this or that or the other?

26:51.087 --> 26:53.091
I don't think it'd make me into a great deal of damage.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.960
Obviously, I'm a little prejudiced towards engineers.

26:57.980 --> 27:10.284
Since I graduated from engineers and recently, as a Friday night, inducted into mechanical engineers.

27:10.304 --> 27:13.450
Hey, that's great.

27:13.902 --> 27:19.649
a group, I think, of 1% a year to take in.

27:19.789 --> 27:23.394
I was very pleased with that Friday night.

27:23.934 --> 27:30.923
But there's so many things done in the ag school and now in business.

27:33.426 --> 27:42.137
I just like to just, the gentleman just went to the billows, we're going to play golf with me a little while.

27:43.484 --> 27:51.114
And he just said, this last week, he said, I know you want to congratulate him.

27:51.855 --> 27:54.759
He said, you know, it's always a pleasure to be in the area.

27:54.779 --> 27:56.281
The students probably look so sharp.

27:59.505 --> 28:09.678
He said, they go around, they look sharp, they dress indecent, and they all look like they didn't want to go down or something like that.

28:10.379 --> 28:11.601
And so generally,

28:11.952 --> 28:23.084
The student body is a reflection of the university that's doing the right thing.

28:23.124 --> 28:25.446
And so, I'm proud of that bunch of students.

28:25.466 --> 28:26.648
And they're a lot smarter than we were going to do one day.

28:26.668 --> 28:27.428
Alright, let's see.

28:30.732 --> 28:34.876
Can you remember any examples of good laughs?

28:35.437 --> 28:38.500
Good, amusing, funny?

28:42.040 --> 28:55.142
probably one of the most amusing things that I would participate in.

28:55.162 --> 28:56.263
I was a regimented band of engineers for a senior year.

28:56.283 --> 28:57.265
And some boilers I think in the field of Ontario.

28:59.135 --> 29:03.303
sort of a clown like to do practical jokes.

29:03.323 --> 29:15.666
And he had gotten these false teeth and just able to get himself where he looked like a complete maniac.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.253
And over there they had

29:19.705 --> 29:27.460
And some of them, they waited till people were in bed.

29:27.480 --> 29:31.288
And then they let him in so they don't snap on the light.

29:31.308 --> 29:34.034
He'd be there careful of them.

29:34.054 --> 29:38.322
So, he got completely apart.

29:39.061 --> 29:52.021
And so I thought that was so much fun that I brought him over in the corner of these years and I had to ask you to have a room, so I let him in there.

29:52.041 --> 29:56.408
He would stand and the folks would stand out in my hallway and see what the results would be.

29:57.449 --> 30:06.283
You'd have a thing from guys, I had never recovers, to bolt him and just come out of that bed and they shot him right past him out the door.

30:08.592 --> 30:18.622
One friend of mine named Phil Pogs was studying me, a really good student, a great engineer.

30:18.642 --> 30:25.929
And Phil was there and the guy, he thought it was his roommate or something, the guy put his hand on his neck and leg.

30:27.570 --> 30:33.056
He looked up and saw him and goosebumps him.

30:33.076 --> 30:36.439
He came right on that handrail.

30:37.010 --> 30:40.294
He'll go out down the stairs.

30:40.314 --> 30:45.341
But things like that will happen on that.

30:45.361 --> 30:46.422
Practical jokes.

30:46.443 --> 30:47.464
Alright, last question.

30:50.508 --> 31:04.907
Over all these A&M years, if you could say thank you, put your arm around the shoulders of a few people that you remember with the greatest joy, who would they be?

31:13.797 --> 31:24.988
Oh, Dr. Wade Greenwood, Buckley Armstrong, Randy Madison, Bob Walker.
