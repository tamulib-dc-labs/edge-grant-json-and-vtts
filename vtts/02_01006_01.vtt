00:01.465 --> 00:05.149
Interview with Sterling Morrison, November 8th, 
1984. Carl Pohlmeier interviewing. Okay.

00:13.738 --> 00:15.579
Should do it. Okay. When did you become a musician? 
When did you start playing the guitar? I started

00:21.466 --> 00:24.148
playing guitar in eighth grade. My original 
instrument was trumpet, and my teacher got

00:25.950 --> 00:29.734
drafted, and I couldn't find a good one. So I did 
nothing for a year. And then picked up a ukulele.

00:36.196 --> 00:37.017
Everybody sees them. And learned three ukulele 
chords and figured, oh, well, why not try and learn

00:38.719 --> 00:45.509
some guitar chords? Actually, my liking for rock 
and roll music led me to, it was just kind of a happy

00:45.969 --> 00:52.799
accident. My teacher was gone, and therefore I was 
free to take another instrument. Rock and roll

00:57.345 --> 00:59.248
would have led me to guitar playing. I regret that I 
wasn't

01:00.680 --> 01:06.950
a keyboard player for my whole life. That's the 
best thing to me, like John Cale. Cale started on

01:10.415 --> 01:19.429
keyboards at three and viola at five and did his 
first BBC concert when he was eight and was a child

01:10.415 --> 01:19.429
prodigy. Naturally, he did all those things for 
us, although we were considered a band with no

01:21.412 --> 01:26.620
talent whatsoever. We're the most scholarship, 
fellowship band in the history of music,

01:27.528 --> 01:37.342
which is an oblique way of saying we're the 
brightest. Not the best, but the brightest. If

01:42.589 --> 01:48.538
being smarter than other bands could get you any 
place, then Velvet Underground would have gotten

01:42.589 --> 01:48.538
there.

01:49.960 --> 01:55.948
We rarely use intelligence in songwriting or in 
our playing, I think. We're not intellectually

01:56.182 --> 01:57.884
pretentious. Only one track, I think. The murder 
mystery, people might think,

02:03.790 --> 02:11.738
has some weirdness to it. We were trying for a 
Joyce-ian rock and roll song. And if you can

02:16.683 --> 02:18.805
decipher it, it's all in code, really. It's about 
the history of the band. Isn't it neat being

02:21.815 --> 02:23.337
unique? You can hear some isolated little 
couplets in there. But it's a real negative,

02:26.920 --> 02:34.628
satirical, and oblique encoded. It is Joycean. 
It's very hard to figure out just what the hell is

02:35.729 --> 02:39.232
being talked about. But it's about the life and 
times of the Velvet Underground. Same as Sister A

02:42.536 --> 02:46.199
is. What were some early influences on guitar 
style? Well, for Lou and me, and

02:51.278 --> 02:57.107
Maureen also. See, Kel was born and raised in 
Wales, and then went to the Royal Academy and all

02:57.147 --> 03:04.820
that sort of thing. So he didn't know anything 
about American rock and roll music, which is

03:05.661 --> 03:09.908
terrific. That guarantees you an absolute fresh 
viewpoint. John could never fall into...

03:19.122 --> 03:21.044
conventional riff playing. He couldn't take a 
lazy way out because he didn't know them. He didn't

03:24.609 --> 03:29.174
know cliches, riffs, songs. He didn't know any of 
this stuff. Lou and I had the... Everybody says

03:30.656 --> 03:38.325
every guitar player now has encyclopedic 
knowledge of all this old crap. Every guitar

03:38.345 --> 03:40.788
player has encyclopedic knowledge. That's how 
you learn. This stuff is not written down. You have

03:44.713 --> 03:45.694
to learn it from records. But it was straight R&B. 
for Lou and me. That's how Lou and I met. I was

03:52.911 --> 03:58.857
playing Lightman Hopkins records, and he was in 
the room above. Finally, he came lurching down,

03:58.877 --> 04:07.845
because he had a campus radio show at Syracuse, 
from which he got kicked off the air. This stuff is

04:08.906 --> 04:12.249
not mainstream music. He said, hey. I didn't even 
know that he was a guitar player. I didn't learn

04:16.674 --> 04:18.255
that for about a week. When Lou tried to disrupt an 
ROTC drill, they used to drill back of the dorm.

04:31.917 --> 04:35.603
First I heard this very loud bagpipe music 
blasting. He had a good high-five set. All us

04:38.107 --> 04:41.191
suburban kids had good high-fives. So he was 
blasting the hell out of them with this bagpipe

04:41.211 --> 04:43.595
music. And then that stopped. And then all of a 
sudden I hear all this kind of humming and

04:47.581 --> 04:50.365
clicking. And then he started blasting with his 
guitar. And I said, yike. Guitar player upstairs.

04:56.373 --> 05:00.960
Must be that guy who won the Leidenhoff 
Conservatory. And he was a creative writing major

05:01.020 --> 05:08.050
and wrote poetry and blah, blah, blah. But 
identical things.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.503
That was where the real music was.

05:20.572 --> 05:21.573
I think things are bad now. You should have seen the 
early 60s. God, it was horrible. Jay and the

05:25.277 --> 05:26.238
American.

05:30.802 --> 05:32.784
There's one thing you don't have to suffer with now 
that we did. It's the battle between rock and roll

05:32.824 --> 05:37.609
and folk.

05:41.073 --> 05:43.395
A horrible, bitter thing. You know, you remember 
that scene, well, pretty obvious, in Animal

05:43.415 --> 05:50.342
House, where The guy is, I gave you my love, and all 
this stuff. Then Belushi comes by, looks at him in

05:54.772 --> 05:59.397
horror, and grabs his guitar and smashes it. 
Belushi, a wonderful thing. That's my favorite

06:05.424 --> 06:06.786
scene in the movie. I would have bashed the guitars 
over the head of every folk singer in America if I

06:07.807 --> 06:13.974
could have laid my hands on them. And then, 
horribly, and I should have anticipated it

06:20.714 --> 06:31.666
predictably, when the folk audience, the folk 
creep, pretentious audience, started to

06:20.714 --> 06:31.666
evaporate, then they just cross over. Bob Dylan I 
loathe in a way that I can't express despising. So

06:39.455 --> 06:41.136
then all of a sudden they had folk rock. Here are 
these same creeps now calling themselves rock and

06:41.217 --> 06:44.941
rollers. I just read a thing with Paul Simon 
someplace. I guess it was Playboy magazine. Paul

06:50.785 --> 06:52.787
Simon considers himself a rocker. And he's 
complaining. He said, you know, I think I've

06:55.650 --> 06:57.752
gotten a bad rap. And people keep relating to me as a 
folk singer. But I'm really a rocker.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.603
If Paul Simon is a rocker, then so is Pat Boone. Pat 
Boone was a hell of a lot more rocked out than Paul

07:10.165 --> 07:13.809
Simon. At least Pat Boone sang Little Richard 
songs. Both are hard rockers compared to Boy

07:18.697 --> 07:21.560
George. If that's hard rock, then... Well, hard 
rock isn't the only rock, but you know what I mean.

07:31.472 --> 07:33.955
By his own admission, he's essentially a 
balladeer. I mean, that's his strength. But you

07:36.297 --> 07:40.502
don't have to suffer with that now.

07:42.237 --> 07:45.062
like rock for whatever it is, there are other 
problems now. What is the real rock and roll as

07:45.943 --> 07:49.490
opposed to what is the pop schmaltz? There was 
always pop schmaltz. But among the people who

07:54.138 --> 08:03.855
really cared about what ought to be the true 
direction, in the 60s it was fragmented, and no

07:54.138 --> 08:03.855
music historian ought to forget that. Some of the 
people thought that it really ought to be folk.

08:09.203 --> 08:12.646
That lyrics really ought to be meaningful and 
socially relevant. They're important things

08:13.107 --> 08:16.910
that can only be communicated this way. The true 
rocker said, stick all that. None of this counts.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.659
Only grunting and shouting and howling. Just 
general antics. And I always thought that's what

08:30.463 --> 08:31.524
we were. See, that was obviously a conflict that 
Lou and I had. I was contended he was soft on folk.

08:38.971 --> 08:42.094
because he wanted to stress lyrics. I would make 
some contributions to lyrics now and again, but I

08:43.796 --> 08:51.203
constantly

08:43.796 --> 08:51.203
devalued their importance.

08:54.927 --> 08:56.489
Not that you should have long instrumentals. 
That's not a very good

08:56.529 --> 09:00.993
idea. I've been talking about the virtues of Louie 
Louie since it came out. I considered it the last

09:03.716 --> 09:08.961
true American rock and roll record. right after 
Louie Louie came to Beatles. Everybody started

09:12.006 --> 09:15.790
trying to sing harmonies and everybody tried to do 
this and that. Just go back and listen to Louie

09:15.810 --> 09:17.311
Louie, what it is. Three power chords, a garbled, 
possibly obscene lyric, hot Fender lead. It was

09:26.441 --> 09:26.961
everything. Condemned by parents and religious 
groups. That's American rock and roll. It's not

09:32.907 --> 09:35.910
a... That's why I always have There's always a soft 
place in my heart for the most outrageous heavy

09:38.118 --> 09:47.631
metal bands, except when they copy each other.

09:48.893 --> 09:53.079
In their despicableness, they're closer to the 
real ideal. Barry Manilow considers himself in

09:53.139 --> 09:56.604
rock and roll. That's rock and roll. A rock concert 
is Barry Manilow.

10:02.732 --> 10:07.399
I would like him to go to a party with Motley Crue or 
something. and do everything that they do, and

10:08.628 --> 10:11.812
then see if he's still alive. The true test of rock 
and roll errs, I guess, is you have to have a little

10:13.374 --> 10:22.946
physical oomph to you, at least initially. That's 
why I think people ought to retire when they reach

10:22.966 --> 10:25.048
about 21. The riggers of the road aren't playing 
gigs night after night. It's partying night after

10:30.696 --> 10:33.859
night. You get done playing at 2 o'clock in the 
morning and carry on until 8, then do a TV show at 10

10:38.328 --> 10:43.556
a.m., and then hit the plane to the next town. 
That's what wears you down. It's not not playing.

10:50.827 --> 10:52.088
That's what keeps you alive, I think. At least for 
those moments, you can't be doing anything really

10:53.250 --> 10:57.136
destructive to your body. You can only do that when 
you get off. When people are waiting in the wings to

11:01.302 --> 11:03.285
help destroy you. A glorious way to go. I always 
liked it. I liked touring. That's another thing

11:09.386 --> 11:13.251
that... Lou was never wild about live 
performance. And still isn't. I always liked it.

11:17.697 --> 11:20.140
Making records is like doing the laundry. Most 
studios look like laundromats. Nowadays, I think

11:24.446 --> 11:29.272
they're a little more... you know, simpatico. 
Maybe, though. Not so much. Some had even neon

11:33.318 --> 11:36.702
lighting. Stuff like that. Strange. But anyway, 
to go back to influences, I would say it was black

11:39.196 --> 11:44.504
music. I listened to old Alan Freed. The 
contribution of Alan Freed isn't to be

11:48.990 --> 11:51.994
exaggerated. Unfortunately, it was only 
confined to people in New York. You had to be there

11:56.581 --> 12:05.093
to compare what Alan Freed played with what was 
standard fare on the radio. He played black music.

12:06.355 --> 12:08.578
I mean, way out stuff, southern black music, 
really strange things. Did he take payola?

12:16.751 --> 12:17.152
Certainly. However, there was a kind of little 
asterisk. You couldn't pay him to play something

12:22.438 --> 12:24.220
he didn't like. You couldn't pay him enough. If he 
thought this is no good and it was going to

12:27.664 --> 12:34.612
embarrass him, and he had real standards about 
what was good, then he wouldn't do it. But yeah,

12:35.293 --> 12:36.034
sure. Here's a black DJ looking to make some money.

12:42.391 --> 12:43.913
All the black artists are trying to make money. All 
they ever wanted to do was be played on the white

12:43.933 --> 12:49.864
stations where the big money was and get big and 
famous. And they finally did, you know, through

12:51.927 --> 12:58.038
Motown, largely. But they've been trying for 
years and years and years.

13:04.786 --> 13:08.610
They were, I guess, kind of compelled to want to try 
to sell out. We were never compelled to, so we never

13:11.133 --> 13:12.655
did.

13:16.439 --> 13:20.604
If only the last nice thing that anybody can ever 
say about the Velvet Underground is that we didn't

13:16.439 --> 13:20.604
sell out, that's true. We did not. Even if I'd known 
what it would take to be a top 10 or a top 40 act, I

13:24.369 --> 13:32.498
wouldn't have done it. I was incapable of wearing a 
suit that matched everything everybody else

13:33.440 --> 13:43.618
wore, or choreographing dance steps, doing a 
little bit of light comedy on TV variety shows. I

13:43.638 --> 13:46.182
had no interest in that stuff. I don't want to 
exchange jibes with Don Rickles. Actually, I

13:51.331 --> 13:52.172
would like to. I suspect I would win as one of the 
unfunniest men. But you know, the things that rock

13:59.275 --> 14:05.827
and roll groups were subjected to, I imagine 
you've seen the old kinescopes of those variety

13:59.275 --> 14:05.827
shows. USA Network has their kind of rock history 
thing. And they show old variety show kinescopes.

14:17.048 --> 14:22.718
You're on as, OK, now for the kiddies, Ed Sullivan 
used to say, now for the kiddies. And it would be the

14:23.542 --> 14:27.047
Rolling Stones or somebody, the Yardbirds. It 
would be somebody good for the kiddies, indeed.

14:32.014 --> 14:35.559
The best group in the history of Ed Sullivan was the 
Rascals. Felix Cavalieri being an old friend of

14:37.622 --> 14:40.005
ours at Syracuse. They went in for the warm-up and 
had the amps weighed down. They turned everything

14:44.471 --> 14:45.553
down. They did all their sound checks and all. And 
then they went back to play the show, and they

14:47.956 --> 14:50.920
played for a live audience. They looked at the size 
of the hall. And they knew exactly what level they

14:53.562 --> 14:58.088
ought to be at for the rock and roll experience. So 
they just turned all the stuff up and they played.

15:01.713 --> 15:05.118
When I was sitting home, I didn't know any of this, 
naturally. I just wanted to see how Felix was going

15:05.919 --> 15:09.143
to do on the tube. And he did Good Lovin'. I can't 
recall if they did Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart

15:13.289 --> 15:15.532
Anymore or not. Great song. But anyway, it sounded 
great. And I said, boy, listen to that. You know how

15:22.503 --> 15:24.886
live music used to sound in Ed Sullivan? It sounded 
horrible. This stuff, boy, it had bottom and

15:26.549 --> 15:29.953
punch. I said, wow, how come they sound so good and 
everybody else sounds horrible? And then when

15:34.920 --> 15:40.709
they were done, Ed Sullivan looked like he'd been 
struck by lightning. And there's a big stink in the

15:40.729 --> 15:43.152
papers the next day. They'll never be on the show 
again and all this stuff. And they damaged the ears

15:46.036 --> 15:48.239
of the studio audience. Oh, they sounded great. 
They just played it like a real live rock gig. And it

15:57.068 --> 15:59.069
sounded great. So that's my vote for the best Ed 
Sullivan performance by a rock group. The Four

16:05.675 --> 16:07.177
Tops did great one time, too. And Reach Out, I'll Be 
There, has that real strong instrumental

16:09.018 --> 16:17.346
introduction. You couldn't even hear it. So they 
essentially sang a cappella the whole way. Great,

16:22.077 --> 16:24.080
great stuff. It was beautiful. What nerve, what 
poise. But to be a rock and roll group in the 60s was

16:28.386 --> 16:34.736
to be a strange creature. The serious and 
respectable people were folk singers. And God

16:41.526 --> 16:44.670
help us, the folk rockers. And then there were the 
have to sell on the charts. And then we had Love and

16:49.038 --> 16:54.184
Peace and Flower Power, so this would all be 
somehow hippie-related. We had nothing

16:54.865 --> 16:58.210
whatsoever to do with the hippies. Our idols were 
the beatniks, mine personally and Lou's

16:58.870 --> 17:04.357
personally. Then I got to hang around with them. 
That was even more amazing. These are the guys I

17:07.842 --> 17:08.903
liked. They were the ones who read books, wrote 
books, wrote poetry, played music, screwed

17:08.943 --> 17:18.555
women, took drugs. That seemed like a good 
lifestyle, intellectual dissipation.

17:28.971 --> 17:34.316
The hippies were know-nothings and do-nothings. 
So I never did like them. I thought they were

17:35.437 --> 17:43.824
harmless and kind of nice, but I wouldn't want to go 
live with them. So I would say we always hung around

17:43.844 --> 17:48.188
with beatnik types and new beatniks. They were our 
intellectual inspiration. Lifestyle. Go read On

17:56.153 --> 17:57.094
the Road again. It's a good book. Unfortunately, 
the best music they had at the time was jazz. But all

18:04.122 --> 18:07.526
the old impulses are there. On the Road's 
wonderful. Tommy taught it here once.

18:14.614 --> 18:19.660
Since everybody now is for Reagan, I don't know if 
On the Road will wash. I forget these people don't

18:20.602 --> 18:26.050
want to do anything except get a job at the bank.

18:29.556 --> 18:39.090
If you didn't want to get a job at the bank at the age 
of 21, then on the road was your kind of thing.

18:39.110 --> 18:40.533
I worked a sperry round when I was 19. I quit because 
I had a sure future. I had free education for any

18:44.999 --> 18:47.123
place it would take me. I was an old engineering 
physics major. They would send me any place and pay

18:49.778 --> 18:51.560
all the money. And I had guaranteed summer jobs and 
guaranteed employment forever and ever and merit

18:52.281 --> 18:56.765
raises and all. And it scared me to death. I said, 
wait, wait. Help. There has to be more things to do

19:01.690 --> 19:03.312
than this. So I took technically leave of absence, 
which I'm still on.

19:10.119 --> 19:15.344
I'm horrified by the way people are 
career-oriented.

19:15.364 --> 19:17.406
And really deadly kind of careers, too. hospital 
supply inventory specialist for which somebody

19:20.086 --> 19:26.014
will give you a PhD. If you consider the courses 
offered at a university, not necessarily A&M here

19:28.037 --> 19:40.855
or anyplace, most have no place at all in the 
traditional conception of a university. All

19:41.956 --> 19:43.018
engineering would be gone. That's trade school. 
All business would be gone. That's trade school.

19:46.703 --> 19:49.587
That accounts for probably 60% of the enrollment 
at UT. I mean out, gone, has no place here. And you

19:54.791 --> 19:58.457
speak to old engineering professors and they'll 
tell you they ought not to be here. The engineering

19:59.919 --> 20:02.824
school ought to be someplace over there. It's not a 
science even. And anyone pretending that

20:07.190 --> 20:16.064
engineers are scientifically motivated, that 
person would be encouraged to get out of

20:07.190 --> 20:16.064
engineering and go into the pure science. It's 
strictly applications.

20:22.270 --> 20:26.375
It doesn't make it contemptible, but people ought 
to realize what it is. I was teaching tech writing

20:26.755 --> 20:30.799
in the chemical engineering department for three 
and a half years. I happen to like engineers,

20:32.982 --> 20:37.026
having been among them for a good while. I like 
getting things done.

20:43.073 --> 20:43.654
That's one side. And the other side likes loafing 
and doing weird things.

20:51.818 --> 20:59.167
What was one of your, or the biggest reasons for 
joining the Velvet Underground, or starting the

20:51.818 --> 20:59.167
Velvet Underground? Yeah, we started it because 
we had no future in music. We started it from a

21:04.294 --> 21:08.079
position of retirement. And

21:08.099 --> 21:14.067
how can anybody say despair, considering how 
young we were? First of all, who wants a career in

21:14.728 --> 21:17.451
music? I didn't. Lou didn't. We had other things to 
do. But always, while we were doing the other

21:22.666 --> 21:25.328
things, we were playing music. Finally, we 
decided in 1963, this is the end. We can't play

21:32.995 --> 21:35.157
gigs. These people don't want to hear the songs 
that we would care to play, which are old R&D

21:35.478 --> 21:42.184
things. This was before the Rolling Stones. So the 
Rolling Stones started rehashing all these white

21:46.588 --> 21:50.091
R&D songs. We just said, well, of course. They'd 
always ask them, who do you like? They'd say, oh, Bo

21:54.306 --> 21:59.533
Diddley and Chuck Berry and Little Walter and all 
those things. I said, well, yeah, who else is

21:59.553 --> 22:01.596
there? But we'd play parties in Syracuse. People 
would get incensed. They wanted to hear Frankie

22:07.444 --> 22:08.946
Valli. They said, no, but how about It's Gonna Work 
Out Fine?

22:17.998 --> 22:18.940
We were in strange bands. We were one called 12 
Screaming Niggers.

22:23.602 --> 22:25.625
Lou and I were the two white boys. Later it became 
Moses and his brothers. Moses Williams is one of

22:30.633 --> 22:33.838
them and all his brothers and a bunch of their 
friends. It was kind of hard to get the old campus

22:35.701 --> 22:40.849
gig with that sort of thing. But it expands one's 
horizons, shall we say.

22:52.728 --> 22:53.749
I grew up on Long Island. I'm incapable of

22:54.149 --> 23:02.997
per se because of my many years among blacks.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.022
But I discriminate among them as viciously as they 
do. Not viciously, but that was another thing that

23:10.283 --> 23:16.869
I didn't like the racial attitudes of the 60s. Oh, I 
just love my black brother. Don't say that. You

23:24.046 --> 23:24.907
don't know. You're a black brother. I know a hell of 
a lot more of them than you do. And I tell you, these

23:29.692 --> 23:32.395
are the ones I like, and these are the ones I got no 
use for. This is a worthless son of a bitch, and this

23:32.856 --> 23:37.641
one here is et cetera.

23:39.643 --> 23:45.109
I was never shamed into liking blacks because I was 
supposed to. I liked them because I did. If I did, I

23:46.190 --> 23:48.773
had real reason for it. They didn't like whites and 
never upset me either. They had reasons for it. I

23:54.999 --> 23:58.965
disliked usually the same whites they did. Yeah, 
so it didn't make any difference. But I thought

24:01.269 --> 24:07.738
that, I don't know what to be said about the 60s. A 
time of great phoniness,

24:07.978 --> 24:15.469
but also sort of experimentation. Some things 
worked, oddly. The sexual revolution worked.

24:20.894 --> 24:25.859
Newsweek telling me that that is over hasn't 
convinced me. I don't know. When it's over on the

24:28.001 --> 24:30.203
college campuses, then I'll know it's over. Is it 
over around here? Is it over at A&M?

24:39.212 --> 24:39.993
It's up to the person.

24:43.116 --> 24:44.557
That would be sad. That would be sad. Because it 
really is kind of a freedom of lifestyle now. That

24:50.768 --> 24:52.531
has lasted. If the youth of today is so 
conservative that they don't even screw, well,

24:53.734 --> 25:00.346
what can you say?

25:05.155 --> 25:12.509
Might take a little energy out of the accounting 
final or something. But that would be pitiful.

25:17.768 --> 25:23.135
That, I thought, at least this will endure of all 
the 60s shenanigans. Maybe not. Bill Burroughs is

25:25.278 --> 25:26.540
one of my favorites.

25:29.984 --> 25:34.610
In despair, I speak to him, and he tells me funny 
things about seeing this.

25:37.834 --> 25:40.398
There's going to be a great howl when Burroughs 
dies.

25:46.145 --> 25:46.746
Irreplaceable. count

25:47.333 --> 25:56.544
the demise of Dali, which looks imminent.

25:57.466 --> 26:02.672
Great tragedy also.

26:02.692 --> 26:09.240
You mentioned civil rights things in the 60s and 
the sexual revolution. Did you emphasize that in

26:09.260 --> 26:12.985
your music of Belitz? No, not overtly. I think 
there's an

26:17.911 --> 26:29.087
obvious laissez-faire attitude to all this.

26:29.107 --> 26:46.332
Since, you know, the little eddies of 
transvestitism,

26:29.107 --> 26:46.332
S&M, and all that sort of thing, drifting through 
the songs,

26:29.107 --> 26:46.332
it should be understood that we would tolerate 
anything. I contended that we just had all

26:48.387 --> 26:50.830
different kind of love songs. Just kind of with 
some kind of love as well. No kinds of love are

26:56.038 --> 26:58.081
better than others. Does that mean I'm bisexual? 
No, because I'm not. I'm straight. Was I ever under

27:03.849 --> 27:05.150
pressure to be? No.

27:10.238 --> 27:12.441
Was I surrounded by homosexuals and weirdos? Yes. 
So what?

27:21.817 --> 27:27.203
Is show business and the art scene infested with 
homosexuals and weirdos? Yes.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.008
So what?

27:35.952 --> 27:37.494
What would happen if you went to their parties? 
Nothing. Have a good time, probably. The

27:42.319 --> 27:44.201
straights will find each other. Others will find 
others. I don't know. I think it was good

27:49.607 --> 27:50.828
education.

27:53.356 --> 27:54.778
Show business people are always weird.

27:59.083 --> 28:08.134
I was reading a thing where Lorne Michaels was 
grumbling about the Belushi book, you know,

27:59.083 --> 28:08.134
Wired, that Woodruff wrote. Woodruff doesn't 
know anything about show business. And he

28:12.019 --> 28:20.168
isolates Belushi's behavior, thinking that this 
is a horrible degenerate. And ought to be held up as

28:22.280 --> 28:26.605
some kind of negative example. He's not a horrible 
degenerate or a negative example. In many ways,

28:31.370 --> 28:32.892
he's just typical. Oh, he may have been a little 
more enthusiastic about drugs than certain other

28:32.912 --> 28:38.118
people. All Lorne Michaels said is, look, show 
business is a life. It entails different hours and

28:43.865 --> 28:51.173
different places to go and different people. If 
you get up at 6 o'clock at night like Dracula and go

28:52.385 --> 29:01.695
to bed at sunrise, which indeed you will do, you 
have to. Your playing schedule is going to be that

29:02.876 --> 29:04.598
way. On the road it's going to be that way. So what 
are you going to do, switch to a 9 to 5 lifestyle when

29:07.401 --> 29:10.985
you get back home? You're up all night and you're 
doing things that the 9 to 5ers don't do. And maybe

29:19.514 --> 29:20.535
you can't even imagine. My favorite night was 
always Sunday night.

29:27.634 --> 29:32.159
Always had kind of a lassitude to it. People were 
totally burnt out from weekend shenanigans. And

29:37.426 --> 29:42.533
it still had enough left in them for at least one 
Sunday night go around. And whoever you saw, this

29:42.553 --> 29:48.861
was a person who didn't care about Monday morning. 
Things would get real lively about 4 or 5 AM.

29:54.265 --> 29:59.710
But that was Lorne Michaels' point, which I 
responded to immediately. To Woodward,

29:59.730 --> 30:07.917
Belushi's antics were horrifying and 
contemptible.

30:07.937 --> 30:08.958
He's a journalist. A journalist who'd go to work 
every morning, I guess come home every night. I

30:13.022 --> 30:15.304
don't know. Had no sympathy whatsoever for show 
business. Not that I do, necessarily. I'm not in it

30:19.868 --> 30:22.230
now. I don't think it makes too many demands.

30:28.509 --> 30:30.632
After a while you cross the threshold and you can't 
come back. That's what I was saying when I left. I

30:34.737 --> 30:39.302
said, if I stick with this much longer, then that's 
all I'm going to be. It

30:40.543 --> 30:47.071
puts you at a permanent remove from everybody 
else. I didn't think that's necessarily a good

30:47.151 --> 30:50.715
idea.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.363
Did you see Broadway Danny Rose? The Woody Allen 
thing? He'll have all these comedians at the

30:57.027 --> 31:06.740
beginning, comics, sitting around in a 
delicatessen, a stage deli in New York, talking

30:57.027 --> 31:06.740
about Broadway Danny Rose. And then you look at his 
clients. That's what show business is. Jugglers

31:14.591 --> 31:16.313
and dog acts. I was always horrified at show 
business. It always frightened me. that people

31:23.855 --> 31:27.499
would devote their lives to this sort of thing. Do I 
like music? Oh, yes, indeed. Love music. But hate

31:30.001 --> 31:33.104
show business. Velvet Underground was never a 
show business band. Just a music band.

31:41.653 --> 31:41.773
And... Ran around with all these theater people 
and

31:41.793 --> 31:47.879
whatnot. Not that we were better. I don't think I 
had enough... I don't think I had a thick enough

31:52.306 --> 31:55.471
skin. It really rankled me when people said 
something negative. But to be a hoofer, people on

31:59.978 --> 32:06.588
stage, this takes some kind of guts. Your ego has to 
be so far away and so protected that you can allow

32:06.748 --> 32:12.878
yourself to do anything. And they do. You know, 
what lies inside Joan Rivers? God? God, no.

32:23.896 --> 32:27.460
Wherever it is, it's well protected. The little 
essence is impervious to anything. So I didn't

32:32.486 --> 32:41.417
think that was such a good idea, to only come out at 
night for life, to hang around with these strange

32:32.486 --> 32:41.417
types. My favorite old TV show were the old 
Berettas. That kind of reminded me of show

32:46.984 --> 32:50.108
business. The sleaze element of it. Burlesque is 
show business. It has all sorts of little

32:56.725 --> 33:01.671
stepchildren.

33:01.691 --> 33:06.917
Those old Berettas where everybody in the movie 
was some pimp or hooker or something. Remember the

33:07.098 --> 33:08.700
ones that they were always trying to get kicked 
off? You ever seen the early, early ones? Oh,

33:11.023 --> 33:13.225
they're sleazy. And he's living with his old 
degenerate Billy.

33:19.694 --> 33:21.696
So that was sort of close to my conception of it. 
peripheral show business life. So why did you

33:28.358 --> 33:30.240
decide to teach English? I was always an English 
major, creative writing. Well, after I, writing

33:32.943 --> 33:38.009
and music got me out of engineering, not bad 
grades. I still like, I was a ham radio operator for

33:39.250 --> 33:47.679
the longest time here.

33:47.699 --> 33:48.961
People thought that was astounding. I said, yeah, 
I like it. Not a CB-er. Old bonafide ham.

34:00.358 --> 34:01.399
I'm not a computer hacker. I bought an Apple 
Macintosh.

34:07.726 --> 34:09.989
Because we get such a good price on it here. Yeah, my 
roommate has some friends here who got him a

34:11.610 --> 34:14.734
Macintosh. Yeah. How do you like it? Yeah, I've 
been playing with it a lot, too. It's fun stuff.

34:20.700 --> 34:21.501
Once you... Once you get the hang of it, it does 
pretty well. It's fast and efficient. I don't know

34:29.242 --> 34:30.083
about... I'm just using it for a word processor. 
Everybody says that's like using a hammer to kill

34:32.306 --> 34:34.870
flies. I don't have any numbers to crunch. What am I 
supposed to do? Figure out the location of the

34:39.095 --> 34:45.764
Earth's satellites two million years down the 
line? I don't know. There are no numbers that I need

34:47.286 --> 34:51.572
to run, so I'm just pushing words.

34:56.547 --> 35:11.123
Back on the music side of it, did your bringing up 
electronics and electrical engineering, did

34:56.547 --> 35:11.123
that have any influence on the band or the new 
technology coming out of the time? New technology

35:11.203 --> 35:12.945
is what really did it. We built a few gizmos on our 
own. And we're not afraid to make modifications on

35:18.891 --> 35:22.956
the guitars. But I think one of the advantages to 
when Velvet Underground got cranked up. Rock

35:30.506 --> 35:39.958
music prior to then was dominated almost 
completely by Fendu and Ampeg in the studios, the

35:30.506 --> 35:39.958
old Gemini 2s. Every studio in the world had a 
Gemini 2. They played so many songs through Gemini

35:41.741 --> 35:43.603
2s.

35:46.366 --> 35:51.012
That's all rock and roll was, and it wasn't going 
anyplace in particular. They invented fuzz tone,

35:51.032 --> 35:55.478
I think, around 1961. But everybody had ways of 
doing that by themselves. As I said in the

35:59.735 --> 36:02.398
biography, my amp already did it. So I didn't need 
to go hear the demonstration. The first time I ever

36:05.923 --> 36:13.374
heard it on a record was Zibbity Doo Dah, Bobby Sox 
in the Blue Jeans. And I didn't care for the sound of

36:13.394 --> 36:14.936
it. My amp, with a smooth distort, fiddling around 
with the preamp,

36:14.956 --> 36:24.269
that sounded better. I was using preamp. type 
things. But then, very early on, Vox had some

36:26.903 --> 36:37.319
breadboard whiz and somehow had enough influence 
that whatever he drew up, they would incorporate

36:26.903 --> 36:37.319
into the amps. And those old Super Beatles were 
just way, way ahead of everybody else. Their

36:45.591 --> 36:48.996
distorters sounded better and their mid-range 
boost was better. Just great sounds came out. It

36:54.711 --> 36:58.154
made bad speakers, so you had to put JBLs in there. 
But, yeah, we had to build our own stuff, because we

36:58.174 --> 37:08.284
were on endorsement to Vox, and the latest 
electronic junk invented would fall into our

36:58.174 --> 37:08.284
hands. And we would then seek uses for it. But Cal 
was always busy designing this and that. He tried a

37:19.534 --> 37:22.317
scheme to make a bass amp out of phase linear amps 
and some kind of cabinets. And it was impossible

37:27.066 --> 37:29.588
damn thing to transport.

37:33.833 --> 37:35.915
So John, look, just take an Acoustic 360. We ran an 
endorsement to Acoustic. He said, that's a good

37:37.537 --> 37:38.478
bass amp. We can carry it. It'll work. All this pile 
of junk here, I don't know who the hell is going to

37:41.341 --> 37:43.724
wire it up. I don't know who's going to fix it when it 
dies, which will probably be two days out. So that

37:50.051 --> 37:50.571
was that. But yeah, we didn't really depend so much 
on on our own little devices, although we did use

37:54.865 --> 37:57.969
them. We just tried to keep abreast of who was doing 
what.

38:05.660 --> 38:10.947
And also, we had long talks with them at Fox with 
their main guy. He then went on and did Marshall.

38:13.751 --> 38:17.216
He's the same character.

38:18.979 --> 38:22.864
Left Fox, and he opted for just a pure power amp. But 
you know the problems with the old Marshalls. They

38:26.428 --> 38:27.209
were so hot. You know, they fried themselves. They 
were designed to. The preamp was just a killer. So

38:38.143 --> 38:42.828
if you wanted to go on the road with Marshalls, we 
never endorsed Marshall and never used them.

38:42.848 --> 38:44.771
Well, I had used them. Whenever we played with the 
MC5, we'd always blow up Wayne Kramer's Marshalls

38:44.791 --> 38:49.797
for him. If you wanted to go on the road, for every 
one you had on stage, you had to have two others. One

38:55.584 --> 39:01.532
was backing you up in the wings, and the other was 
off in the shop being fixed. I'm not kidding. So you

39:01.973 --> 39:04.797
needed three times as much stuff. So at the time of 
the Marshall heyday, we were using sun amps

39:04.817 --> 39:12.087
because they were dependable. Indeed, they are 
dependable.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.014
How about guitars? You've mentioned Fenders. 
Yeah, the Strat or the Telecaster was used a lot

39:19.375 --> 39:22.180
back then. Did Joe use Fender or Gibson or what else 
do I... Well, Lou,

39:22.981 --> 39:34.660
Lou's original guitar, I can't say it's his 
original. It's the first one I ever saw him with,

39:34.680 --> 39:38.066
and I dare say it is his original. It was an old Coco 
Brown Gretsch.

39:42.653 --> 39:45.518
That's the Ostrich guitar.

39:48.367 --> 39:49.848
And why did Lou choose a Gretsch? Well, that was 
what all the black guitar players used, and Bo

39:50.749 --> 39:54.152
Diddley and all. So he had this old, 
horrible-looking Gretsch. And we pulled the

39:57.135 --> 39:59.858
frets off it, so it became a fretless guitar. That 
was an ostrich guitar, modal tuned. And I had all

40:04.382 --> 40:07.665
these old Junkers. And an SG. I bought one of the 
first SGs that came out, because it had great

40:12.009 --> 40:17.935
drive, back in 61. I'm still very, very fond of SGs. 
That guitar was stolen, but it upset me. I'm going

40:25.447 --> 40:26.748
to have all these old fenders. I had an old pink 
Paisley Telecaster 55. It looked like vomit. This

40:34.717 --> 40:35.979
is the ugliest guitar. If I had that now, I could 
sell it for $5,000. Nobody would believe anything

40:38.782 --> 40:42.606
this ugly could be manufactured by the factory. It 
had a perfect Telecaster sound. Perfect. That's

40:46.586 --> 40:47.107
gone. But I have two old Strats and a couple Fender 
12s and a 335 stereo. A good, workable

40:55.159 --> 40:58.765
guitar. Anybody? Are there you guys guitar 
players? We both are. Yeah. What do you play? I've

41:04.073 --> 41:05.274
got a Fender Mustang. A real primitive. Yeah. 64. I 
could have a Duosonic. And a duosonic and a Fender

41:12.708 --> 41:19.016
Reverb amp for $200.

41:21.259 --> 41:22.901
And I never got over there to pick it up. This was 
since I was in Texas. So you throw the duosonic

41:24.823 --> 41:26.105
away. Patti Smith used to play a duosonic. To no 
particular effect. You've got a Fender Reverb

41:31.332 --> 41:33.234
amp. Yeah. What kind of guitar? Well, I just got a 
347. Oh. It was a... The bank repossessed it, so I

41:41.986 --> 41:44.709
got it with the ode. How much is that? Six. How much? 
Six hundred. That's nice. That is a baritone

41:49.854 --> 41:53.998
and... Yeah, it was just a couple months old. Is 
that a stereo? No. No. You know, the really... The

41:58.482 --> 41:59.543
only thing about it is that... Does it have a 
baritone on it? No. I guess not. They wouldn't put

42:02.566 --> 42:03.947
that on unless it's stereo. About the five 
position baritone. It's on the old... 345 and 355s

42:11.332 --> 42:12.454
usually had them. Very nice.

42:17.240 --> 42:21.306
You know, the Lucille-type BBK. The only thing 
wrong with Gibsons now is you have to play about 100

42:22.147 --> 42:29.278
of them to find one that's playable. What I would 
do, I would just buy one, find one that's playable,

42:29.298 --> 42:33.484
and then take it off to a good neck person. Dan 
Armstrong, I would say Lou and I are probably among

42:34.425 --> 42:40.714
his absolute first customers, among the first 
five. He was a musician who decided that he wanted

42:41.234 --> 42:45.399
to do some guitar repair. And a very funny thing 
happened. One day in his store in West Broadway, he

42:49.083 --> 42:52.447
opened up a new location. He was in there. He had my 
335 stereo in there.

42:59.795 --> 43:08.786
And this German guy who developed the pickups that 
he uses in the Dan Armstrong, you know, the

42:59.795 --> 43:08.786
plexiglass drums, these big... So he's playing 
something. He says, How do you like that, huh? Just

43:13.538 --> 43:15.020
blasts your ass off, doesn't it? I said, oh, come 
on. I think the old P-35 can match that. Stereo, you

43:22.326 --> 43:25.790
get 35% more gain anyway. I think I still like the 
sound of this. But I will say that I used Dan

43:30.354 --> 43:34.658
Armstrong in the studio a few times. I used it on the 
Loaded album. On New Age, I definitely used it. And

43:42.541 --> 43:44.864
I think I'll cool it down. I don't

43:46.146 --> 43:52.035
know if it was using Sweet Jane or not. I'm trying to 
think. I can't remember what the hell it was

43:53.558 --> 43:57.644
playing. It got a real kind of clinical sound to it. 
Of course, way too much. It looked neat. I should

44:06.717 --> 44:11.024
have suspected you guys were going to talk about 
this. Are you playing in dance? Same

44:13.861 --> 44:18.107
problem that you had. You can't find anybody to 
want to hear the music you like to play. Yeah. Yeah,

44:24.976 --> 44:26.999
so anyway, that was the original question. So we 
had given up. We said, well, who said you have to

44:29.162 --> 44:31.305
play in public anyhow? So Lou John and I decided 
practicing by ourselves and playing songs for our

44:31.686 --> 44:37.955
own amusement. There was Smokey Robinson songs

44:37.995 --> 44:43.362
and sort of taught John some rock and roll stuff. 
And then we started evolving these weird things of

44:46.733 --> 44:50.698
our own. It didn't matter, because you had no hope 
of going out to play them. So, why not? I'm

44:59.067 --> 45:03.773
just trying to figure out my own clock. We were 
under no constraints. Quick, you have to write all

45:08.138 --> 45:10.660
this original material so you can go out and play 
it. We knew we weren't going to go out and play it. We

45:13.497 --> 45:18.962
just very calmly would play three, four, five 
nights a week anyway. And had a great time. No

45:23.347 --> 45:26.770
pressure, no anything, and no money. In the winter 
in New York, in John's unheated apartment,

45:27.891 --> 45:32.576
sometimes we had rugs on our shoulders as we 
played. Is this suffering? No, because we just

45:34.057 --> 45:36.580
felt like playing music. And if it gets too cold, 
you can always Take some pills or something. You

45:43.927 --> 45:44.528
won't feel it. So we did that and then kind of got 
lured out into, somebody said, why don't you come

45:46.370 --> 45:56.984
back up some movies, you know, underground 
cinema. So we said, oh sure, why not. You mean we

45:59.667 --> 46:01.369
actually get to play anything we want? He said, 
yeah, you can do anything you want. And you're just

46:04.193 --> 46:06.516
the music back there. So we said, oh, terrific. So 
we started playing this stuff. Then we made a tape,

46:13.323 --> 46:22.957
and it just all sort of happened by accident.

46:22.977 --> 46:25.019
It's probably the way it ought to happen. To 
succeed in music, the element of luck is

46:25.039 --> 46:31.328
extraordinary.

46:34.430 --> 46:41.158
When you're on the road, you can't go into a town 
without finding musicians there who can play

46:34.430 --> 46:41.158
anything better than anybody you ever heard. To

46:41.178 --> 46:52.971
these people, all you can say is get yourself a band 
and

46:41.178 --> 46:52.971
try to write some material and then try and get 
lucky.

46:56.215 --> 46:58.577
Just go with the flow, whatever it is.

47:01.641 --> 47:02.682
My favorite gigs are The earliest ones.
