00:01.853 --> 00:12.327
In the beginning, it was easy to get the entire 
community to participate because they were the

00:01.853 --> 00:12.327
pioneers and they had that sense of excitement of 
being involved in something that was very new and

00:01.853 --> 00:12.327
starting it. And one of the things that was done was 
to have luminarias on every driveway and road and

00:13.128 --> 00:21.960
front yard on Christmas Eve. And using my street 
again as a good example, there is probably a third

00:23.142 --> 00:29.751
of the residents that are original purchasers the 
resale second or third or fourth time resale

00:30.153 --> 00:54.692
homeowner who has not been to the information 
center who has not watched the woodlands grow and

00:30.153 --> 00:54.692
been here from those early days doesn't know why 
somebody's knocking on their door saying we need

00:30.153 --> 00:54.692
six dollars for the luminarias for christmas eve 
and all the Experienced veteran residents know,

00:55.685 --> 01:00.413
oh, that's for the luminaries, and the whole 
community does it. And so now the challenge is to

01:01.214 --> 01:19.706
maintain that small feeling or that sense of 
community when we've got 30,000 people so that we

01:01.214 --> 01:19.706
don't become one of those subdivisions, if you 
will, where people don't have that sense of

01:01.214 --> 01:19.706
loyalty. How does that challenge be managed? The 
WCA, the Woodlands Community Association, is the

01:22.195 --> 01:39.893
one, the best source to help organize the 
different villages and get a community-wide

01:22.195 --> 01:39.893
effort going or maintain it. Currently, you'll 
talk to people, I'm sure, that are gonna talk about

01:41.074 --> 01:48.541
this year's effort in recycling. The club has been 
formed WCA has negotiated with Western Waste to do

01:51.338 --> 02:01.948
some curbside pickup of recyclables on a test 
basis to see how the thing can work. We have two

02:02.569 --> 02:03.910
local newspapers.

02:06.613 --> 02:08.575
That helps to get the word out. Again, going back to 
the problem of size,

02:09.555 --> 02:20.586
the YMCA, the Little League program, the 
churches, the grocery store, when everything was

02:21.190 --> 02:31.465
smaller, you kept running into familiar faces at 
every turn. Now, you see many people that you just

02:32.286 --> 02:48.109
don't see very often, and I can feel it, and I'm 
certain those that have been here longer than five

02:32.286 --> 02:48.109
and a half years can feel it as well. that that's 
going to be a real challenge for us to maintain that

02:48.730 --> 03:00.367
very strong loyalty and sense of community that 
the Woodlands has. The lighting of the doves is a

03:00.407 --> 03:09.741
good example where we shut down the road here and 
have several thousands of people come and watch

03:00.407 --> 03:09.741
the lighting of the doves before Christmas time.

03:12.104 --> 03:18.113
You can go to that and see a lot of people that you 
just didn't see at Little League or soccer or or

03:18.548 --> 03:19.909
church or the grocery store. And you know they live 
here. And

03:22.011 --> 03:39.288
in that regard,

03:22.011 --> 03:39.288
I think what will happen is each generation of 
homebuyer will have their sense of community. And

03:39.308 --> 03:45.214
as we go ever further to the west and to the north as 
we develop, will have sub-neighborhoods within

03:45.565 --> 03:53.394
the woodlands where they may have a particular 
bond with one another. And there will be a sense of

03:53.434 --> 03:58.339
sub-community within the woodlands. I would 
think it's overly sanguine to expect, in a

03:58.359 --> 04:09.371
community of 30,000 people, which may double in 10 
years, that people are going to say the woodlands

03:58.359 --> 04:09.371
as a possessive. They may say Grogan's Mill as a 
possessive, or some other government. I don't

04:13.276 --> 04:14.357
think that's going to happen. And in a way, we've

04:14.557 --> 04:21.867
unconsciously done that.

04:27.093 --> 04:41.172
What I'm trying to say is that we've somewhat 
synchronized the construction activity

04:27.093 --> 04:41.172
in in a sizable portion of the new home offering.

04:50.586 --> 05:04.244
And what I'm trying to say is one of the areas that we 
did in North Panther Creek had village weekly life

04:50.586 --> 05:04.244
forms, the smaller custom and the medium sized 
custom homes. We had 600 home sales all take place

05:04.264 --> 05:10.011
within a two year period, all in one general 
vicinity. in the past many times we would have had

05:10.447 --> 05:39.981
the custom activity finishing up in one area while 
the production housing was starting up in a new

05:10.447 --> 05:39.981
area and we had sort of leapfrogged with 
production first and then custom later and you had

05:10.447 --> 05:39.981
some

05:10.447 --> 05:39.981
lag of one or two or three years before a particular 
30-40 acre section got developed and so you really

05:40.838 --> 05:48.550
You never got everybody moving in all at one time 
and then all the construction being finished all

05:40.838 --> 05:48.550
at one time and the project be finished. And I think 
that just as things have worked out, partly

05:49.311 --> 06:05.214
because of the pace that we were fortunate enough 
to enjoy where we were selling 600, 700, 800 a year,

05:49.311 --> 06:05.214
you can go in and finish something. I think we got 
out of that pattern in the early 80s because The

06:10.606 --> 06:18.036
plan was certainly to finish as quickly as 
possible, but the market wasn't there, and so the

06:10.606 --> 06:18.036
sales slowed down, and it just didn't work out. You 
mentioned this was accidental. Having

06:20.179 --> 06:29.552
recognized the advantage of doing that, is that 
now going to be a built-in element? It's as much as,

06:29.813 --> 06:34.078
boy, to the extent the market will let us do it, 
absolutely. Because if there's one thing that

06:34.719 --> 06:37.423
upsets current residents, It's the activity of 
subcontractors on their property while building

06:38.112 --> 06:42.438
a home next door.

06:45.482 --> 07:01.503
From trash to debris and beer bottles or whatever, 
it's a problem for the developer to keep the

06:45.482 --> 07:01.503
existing resident happy with respect to radios 
blaring at 6 in the morning. It's not a pleasant

07:03.686 --> 07:08.052
experience to have a home built next door to your 
home or a block away for that matter. And that's

07:08.656 --> 07:14.343
been one of the sort of fringe benefits of this pace 
that we've enjoyed. We really get in and out of a

07:14.924 --> 07:16.606
neighborhood. You know, the trucks are off the 
street and people, you know, the sandwich pickups

07:18.789 --> 07:25.678
aren't coming up and down the street. It's a better 
street. It's a better environment. Do you work

07:30.243 --> 07:31.725
with the builders as well? I don't work directly 
with them. Ted Nelson is the director of lot sales

07:34.088 --> 07:37.853
and he's deals one-on-one with them in terms of 
putting the lots under contract and day-to-day

07:38.238 --> 07:49.290
negotiations, if you will. I just wondered, 
because the other side of the story you're telling

07:49.690 --> 08:00.261
me is that, yes, we worked hard with the realtors, 
yes, we worked hard with the companies and

07:49.690 --> 08:00.261
residents, future and past. How have we worked 
with the builders to... All right, let me go back to

08:00.562 --> 08:03.305
that. Maybe this is a longer story than I realized, 
but One of the other things that was clear to me in

08:06.807 --> 08:20.907
1985, and that was that the Woodlands home designs 
were woefully out of date. All of my experience

08:20.927 --> 08:24.492
prior to coming up here had been on the west side of 
Houston. And at that time, in the new homes, by and

08:25.153 --> 08:36.308
large, you had to have, in order to be competitive 
the glass showers in the master baths, or the

08:36.912 --> 08:59.123
Jennier cook range in the kitchen, or an island in 
the kitchen,

08:36.912 --> 08:59.123
the atrium windows over the kitchen window, or 
skylights, 10-foot ceilings, plant ledges, a

08:36.912 --> 08:59.123
whole lot of excitement on the interior of the 
home. And I got here, and the kitchens were small,

09:00.345 --> 09:06.193
the cabinet count was small, They didn't have 
sizable kitchen family living room

09:06.916 --> 09:11.341
arrangements. The designs were out of date.

09:17.588 --> 09:26.337
Ted Nelson and I took it upon ourselves to go and 
find some new builders or try to get the existing

09:17.588 --> 09:26.337
builders to change. I think we turned over about 
50% of the new home builder group. Some of them

09:30.822 --> 09:36.568
wisely said, I've made a lot of money and I'm not 
going to try and build homes in the late 80s. And

09:39.486 --> 09:40.327
they kept their money. What do you mean by that? You 
mean they said, we're not going to play? They just

09:44.032 --> 09:47.036
said, I just don't want to risk my money. I don't 
want to be a home builder in the 80s, in the last half

09:47.696 --> 09:53.324
of the 80s.

09:53.604 --> 09:54.165
I think I'm done. And whatever their goal was, they 
picked up their marbles and went home.

10:00.654 --> 10:04.058
Fortunately, those who stayed and the ones that 
we've since recruited have come here and brought

10:04.595 --> 10:12.144
new designs, sat down with the salespeople and 
said, tell us what the buyers are asking for. We

10:13.946 --> 10:20.715
then encouraged them to provide a minimum number 
of inventory of homes. And we said, you've got to

10:21.055 --> 10:26.982
have this many homes in inventory for the 
springtime, prime buying season. We've got all

10:27.543 --> 10:34.011
this work going on with Wanda Mason and the Relo 
companies and the realtor community promising

10:34.379 --> 10:36.222
that we're going to have plenty of new home 
inventory. We're looking to you to provide it, and

10:36.823 --> 10:41.369
we're also looking to you to provide what's going 
to sell. And we really, I think the numbers are like

10:42.170 --> 10:54.127
85 or 90 homes in 85 that were custom, and then it 
grew to about 125. Today we're at about a third are

10:54.969 --> 10:59.475
custom, and they steadily grew. 120, 152, 250, and 
on up to about three this year. So we changed what

11:05.400 --> 11:10.785
the homebuyers saw when they got here. And we 
changed some of our planning to accommodate a

11:11.546 --> 11:17.191
little bit wider lot. There's a big demand. One of 
the big things, especially with the number of

11:19.233 --> 11:25.559
out-of-town buyers who came from a community 
where they had a basement, there's no basement. So

11:26.560 --> 11:29.243
we have a third garage whenever possible. because 
they have the need for the space to put their stuff

11:29.864 --> 11:33.868
in. So a little bit wider garage, a little bit 
deeper garage, and then just all of those things I

11:36.051 --> 11:54.030
mentioned about higher ceilings and all the other 
do-why gadgets in the house has really created an

11:36.051 --> 11:54.030
exciting group of homes to come and look at, and 
they'll showcase the homes that we do every

11:36.051 --> 11:54.030
spring. Has brought some new and innovative stuff 
And so that has helped the pace of new home sales,

11:59.665 --> 12:06.216
obviously. So we changed what was being offered as 
well. And that was another good strategic move,

12:08.860 --> 12:15.231
was to go out and get the right stuff to be built. So 
we did some internal things and paid a lot of

12:16.693 --> 12:23.985
attention to the external things.

12:27.104 --> 12:36.192
Now the big challenge for 1991 is going to be, will 
the people coming from the east or west coast be

12:27.104 --> 12:36.192
able to sell their house? Yeah. I'm running out of 
time. You're running out of time. But that's

12:41.276 --> 12:43.738
something I want to explore a little bit. What does 
the future hold for the woodlands? That's one

12:45.800 --> 12:53.507
thing I want you to think about, not just in the 
short term, but also maybe through the year 2000

12:45.800 --> 12:53.507
and beyond. Because one of the things I'm looking 
at George Mitchell, whose vision and personality

12:56.534 --> 13:03.209
is stamped all over the place, is 72.

13:05.194 --> 13:14.475
The Woodlands obviously isn't going to tap out at 
150,000 until a good 25, 30 years, not really more.

13:15.299 --> 13:19.243
In fact, that's one of the things about his vision 
that is so intriguing, is he's planning for things

13:15.299 --> 13:19.243
which he will never see. Oh, really? Is he planning 
that? I don't know. Yeah, that's true. He may, like

13:24.808 --> 13:28.952
God, strides the world and thinks he will never 
die. But

13:28.992 --> 13:41.104
what I'm curious about, though, is what 
challenges do you foresee, perceive? How

13:41.962 --> 13:52.054
successful do you think that vision will be

13:41.962 --> 13:52.054
with the possible exit of Mr. Mitchell? How 
enduring is that vision? How baked into the

13:55.318 --> 13:58.862
infrastructure is that vision? Those kinds of 
questions.

14:06.771 --> 14:09.454
There is, to my knowledge,

14:11.071 --> 14:16.055
no public or private document that talks about 
what happens after that date. Mr. Mitchell's not

14:16.636 --> 14:20.419
personally addressing our focus. So it's just my 
hunch. My hunch is that he

14:23.742 --> 14:34.711
will have put in place some mechanism whereby his 
desires will be adhered to.

14:39.715 --> 14:40.656
In terms of the good feeling that people have about 
the Woodlands people live here now I think it will

14:41.682 --> 15:06.525
keep that good feeling as I said where we moved in 
600 people in two years to one area will continue to

14:41.682 --> 15:06.525
have that good feeling on on a small sub community 
level but I think that one of the things that the

15:08.834 --> 15:36.765
the scope of things that unite the people in the 
woodlands will adjust to the the growth and the one

15:08.834 --> 15:36.765
example that i'm thinking about right now to try to 
explain what i mean by those words is the pavilion

15:08.834 --> 15:36.765
you can't have a pavilion that holds 11 000 people 
and doing a community-wide event if you've only

15:08.834 --> 15:36.765
got 11 000 people if you've got 30 000 people now you 
can deal with the scale and scope of a facility like

15:37.454 --> 15:41.640
the pavilion. The mall, I'm sure, will have events 
that will be suitable for a community of 60,000 or

15:43.643 --> 15:54.718
90,000 or whatever the final number may be. And he 
may have visions of things beyond that. I don't

15:59.345 --> 15:59.866
know. But whenever... The planning number I heard 
is 100 and a half. Oh, yeah. But what I'm saying is I

16:04.052 --> 16:06.415
don't know what facility... would balance with a 
community of that size. Is it another mall? Is it a

16:11.531 --> 16:12.852
hyper mall? Is it like the one in Canada with the 
Walt Disney thing under one roof? I don't know. But

16:18.096 --> 16:36.672
the concept of, in a way, not in a way, but very 
dramatically, the shift to the focus on the

16:18.096 --> 16:36.672
environment could make Mr. Mitchell appear to be 
more of a genius than he is. because if you go back to

16:37.090 --> 16:52.245
the 70s when the Woodlands was launched and you 
remember a John Denver and the

16:37.090 --> 16:52.245
anti-establishment kind of feeling, this was a 
real progressive thing. To me, that's one of the

16:52.946 --> 17:01.855
marketing challenges we have is in its day, the 
Woodlands was very new, made a major break from the

16:52.946 --> 17:01.855
development community standards of its day. 
Today, friends of mine that work for other

17:01.895 --> 17:07.080
developers have caught up on paper they all have 
hike and bike trails they all have amenities they

17:07.752 --> 17:29.743
all on paper will read a master plan community our 
challenge is going to be how to get different from

17:07.752 --> 17:29.743
our competition as it exists today again and still 
adhere to the natural look the mix of different

17:30.112 --> 17:37.186
housing styles in one neighborhood, I think those 
things will happen. But the challenge is already

17:37.206 --> 17:38.870
being met, though, in a way. Mr. Mitchell and Marty 
Souter, Dominic Lamb, there's a bunch of people

17:42.953 --> 17:48.120
who are in fact addressing issues that King would 
never address. The vision is a distinct vision.

17:52.046 --> 17:58.635
That is, let's have a lot of people, a significant 
proportion, maybe even a third of the people

17:52.046 --> 17:58.635
working in the woodlands. We drive five minutes 
and they're at work. They can go home for lunch.

18:03.241 --> 18:05.084
That kind of thing is novel. Absolutely.

18:08.769 --> 18:12.454
My crystal ball gets real foggy when you talk about 
fifty thousand plus I

18:13.244 --> 18:43.015
think that what we have achieved from the 
residential standpoint and the balance of

18:13.244 --> 18:43.015
housing and the pace of 900 or so a year is a is a bit of 
a plateau and a good one and a comfortable one and

18:46.758 --> 18:51.524
We hope to do a little bit better than that in terms 
of our 25-year projections.

18:54.447 --> 19:04.940
Will the time ever come when you guys are held back 
so that, in fact, the job creating element can

18:54.447 --> 19:04.940
catch up? There's an incipient danger. in this 
community in that it could turn into another

19:09.050 --> 19:12.534
development. If, in fact, those jobs don't come 
online, it becomes another Kingwood in a way.

19:18.620 --> 19:30.792
Again, going back to external factors and their 
effect on our success, one of the other major ones

19:18.620 --> 19:30.792
that I left out was the tollway system in Houston. 
And to answer what you've just addressed about

19:30.812 --> 19:34.416
internal job growth, I'd submit that the Sam 
Houston Tollway and Hardy Toll Road will provide,

19:35.105 --> 19:48.520
they're already providing, homebuyers who work 
in far west Houston because they want to be with

19:35.105 --> 19:48.520
trees. And I would say that all the mega plans that 
exist for mass transportation in Houston, that

19:49.781 --> 20:01.534
even without internal job growth, the home sales 
will be there because the transportation will be

20:02.240 --> 20:07.967
improved to the point that we'll be able to 
accommodate the commuter better. That I

20:08.487 --> 20:09.348
understand. My concern was in terms of how much 
commitment, I guess, is what I'm asking. Is there

20:14.374 --> 20:20.722
to the holistic, philosophical basis upon which 
the Woodlands was created? That is, that it is in

20:20.762 --> 20:27.710
fact a hometown, that people work here, they play 
here, they live here. Do you see what I'm saying?

20:30.320 --> 20:36.469
And when one gets out of balance with the other, or 
isn't even close, or will that even be allowed to

20:30.320 --> 20:36.469
happen? That's a good question for somebody else. 
My only comment would be that the amount of money

20:40.395 --> 20:54.055
that has been and is being invested in the job 
creation side, I would venture to say it's

20:40.395 --> 20:54.055
unrealistic to think that we would abandon that. 
That's kind of what you're calling for. I agree. If

20:57.600 --> 20:59.162
it doesn't work, will we abandon it? I think that's 
not one of the choices. No, that wasn't in a way, but

21:01.851 --> 21:21.837
I also wondered, will you be allowed to

21:01.851 --> 21:21.837
grow at the rates which you can grow, given the 
tollway access, when the philosophical

21:01.851 --> 21:21.837
underpinnings of the woodlands get undermined 
because it becomes really a residential

21:01.851 --> 21:21.837
community? Too normal? Yeah, too normal. Too 
normal? Yeah. I don't know. That's a good

21:25.202 --> 21:26.844
question. I don't know. Of course, you probably 
wouldn't decide that anyway. Yeah. I've got to

21:34.316 --> 21:38.790
go. Okay. Good, because I can't answer the 
question.
