WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:04.847
...and in keeping ourselves alive. I guess 
essentially your entire career has been

00:06.349 --> 00:09.093
supported by NAACP. Oh yes, absolutely. I was, as I 
say, worked for Kuiper as a summer student and then

00:10.395 --> 00:18.246
as a graduate student on NASA money. I was kept with 
student deferments from the Vietnam War because I

00:19.608 --> 00:30.223
was working in a university on NASA support. And 
ever since, and now, of course, I'm a NASA

00:30.743 --> 00:34.909
employee. How do you think NASA has managed this? I 
mean, have they understood what's going on in

00:37.953 --> 00:41.818
planetary astronomy? Or have they tried to 
overmanage, micromanage, whatever? Or have they

00:44.902 --> 00:46.685
done a reasonably good job? Well, they've done all 
of those things because they've tried it all ways.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.694
And in many respects, it has been done very well. 
The main problem, I think, is that because modern

00:54.195 --> 00:59.502
planetary science is a child of of NASA and 
government funding, it has not found its way in

01:00.022 --> 01:09.733
fully legitimate ways into American academic 
circles. There are not enough planetary science

01:10.294 --> 01:17.081
positions in faculties in the universities in the 
United States. And this leaves planetary

01:17.662 --> 01:23.368
scientists in a very, very vulnerable position. 
NASA, I think, has made minor and relatively

01:24.009 --> 01:29.235
ineffective efforts to to put planetary science 
in legitimate academic institutions around the

01:29.620 --> 01:38.469
country, but it could have done and should have 
done and must do much more. That is the real

01:39.470 --> 01:56.708
weakness in planetary science now, I think, is 
that as the government funding waxes and wanes,

01:39.470 --> 01:56.708
there is no adequate buffer in the American 
academic institutions to keep planetary science

01:39.470 --> 01:56.708
moderately comfortable. Do you think planetary 
astronomy is part of astronomy? Planetary

01:59.945 --> 02:05.270
astronomy, I think, is and should be considered 
part of astronomy. And

02:06.311 --> 02:12.716
there was a time when I was less sure of that, maybe 
10 years ago. But the reason I'm adamant about it

02:13.417 --> 02:28.230
now is that it's clear to me that classical 
astronomy is moving toward the understanding of

02:13.417 --> 02:28.230
the formation and development of planetary 
systems in general, and ours in particular, and at

02:13.417 --> 02:28.230
the same time, people with their training in 
planetary astronomy and planetary science are

02:28.413 --> 02:42.913
becoming more and more aware of the connection to 
the interstellar medium and the material that is

02:28.413 --> 02:42.913
formed there and incorporated into our solar 
system. When we hold in our hands, for example, a

02:42.933 --> 02:57.694
carbonaceous meteorite, we are holding 
pre-solar material, material which is preserved

02:42.933 --> 02:57.694
largely intact from its formation and chemical 
evolution in the interstellar medium. So there is

02:58.231 --> 03:11.532
a very natural connection in terms of materials 
that we can study, objects that we can look at

02:58.231 --> 03:11.532
between planetary astronomy, studies of our 
solar system, and studies of the interstellar

02:58.231 --> 03:11.532
medium. Sorry, Gene, to interrupt it yesterday 
when they were trying to take your picture. But I

03:19.505 --> 03:23.952
just told Dale here. in the drawing, I got a piece of 
Allende. You lucky dog. I saw it come in. Ed Barker

03:30.440 --> 03:32.923
and I were observing on the 82-inch. It was a lot of 
serious. He was standing on the catwalk, and I was

03:34.505 --> 03:36.688
down the road. In Texas? Yeah. At McDonald's. And 
you talk about the ignorant peasants being

03:38.450 --> 03:41.334
scared. That thing, it was a coup d'etat run. The 
moon was just two days past full. that wiped it out.

03:49.294 --> 03:51.196
And you could see the smoke. It was like a crude oil 
tank blowing up. And I ran up to Ed, and I said, it's

03:53.399 --> 03:56.863
got to be a carbonaceous chondrite. I mean, he's 
right here. You can ask him. I said that. But it

04:01.029 --> 04:05.515
looked like the Hindenburg going up, which was my 
first reaction. And so I got a piece of it. And I

04:07.958 --> 04:10.741
don't know who to tell except you characters. Who 
would appreciate that? Do you mind if we just, you

04:13.583 --> 04:16.566
can do your stuff and we'll just talk over here? 
Sure. Just finishing up an interview. In the old

04:20.290 --> 04:25.915
days, there wasn't any Icarus. There wasn't any 
division for planetary sciences. And now

04:29.979 --> 04:35.805
planetary astronomers in this country have their 
own society and their own journal. Do you think

04:35.825 --> 04:36.766
that's good or bad? Well, I think it's good. On the 
one hand, it has provided a medium for us to publish

04:38.384 --> 04:45.533
all the kinds of things that we do. There is, of 
course, a downside to it. And a quick illustrative

04:48.316 --> 04:52.442
point might be useful. At the time that radio 
astronomy was developing as a kind of a separate

04:53.162 --> 05:02.274
discipline, there was some discussion as to 
whether or not the radio astronomers should have

04:53.162 --> 05:02.274
their own journal. And Otto Struve, I believe, was 
the vociferous proponent of not having a separate

05:02.935 --> 05:08.121
journal. and keeping astrophysics unified 
through the astrophysical journal,

05:08.337 --> 05:18.552
principally, and the astronomical journal, 
whether the results come from the radio part of the

05:08.337 --> 05:18.552
spectrum or the optical infrared part of the 
spectrum. So that's a voice in favor of keeping

05:18.952 --> 05:22.237
things together. However, because,

05:22.778 --> 05:34.294
and this is now a personal view, because of the 
animosity or the ambivalence, let's soften it a

05:22.778 --> 05:34.294
bit, too, that we've already talked about between 
classical astronomers and planetary

05:34.696 --> 05:47.772
scientists, there has developed a kind of set of 
different standards to which research papers

05:34.696 --> 05:47.772
should be held for publication. And I think that if 
the Astrophysical Journal were the only medium

05:48.473 --> 05:59.427
for the publication of planetary science papers, 
we would have a lot of problems getting some of our

05:48.473 --> 05:59.427
work published. Not because it's intrinsically 
inferior in quality, but because it's different.

06:04.058 --> 06:06.902
And some of our standards are a bit different. Some 
of them are fully as rigorous as those to which

06:07.303 --> 06:11.969
classical astrophysicists hold their work. 
Certainly superior in cosmology. Perhaps, yes, I

06:14.293 --> 06:15.434
think so. I've found myself apologetic about the 
quality of spectra that I've published and

06:16.416 --> 06:21.563
interpreted from time to time. And then I 
occasionally see what my astrophysics

06:22.084 --> 06:27.432
colleagues are doing, and I feel less apologetic.

06:30.216 --> 06:31.838
What do you think was the impact of the fact that we 
have found no evidence for life anywhere else in

06:32.037 --> 06:36.242
the solar system. Do you think that's really hurt 
funding, in particular Mars? Oh, I don't think

06:40.788 --> 06:48.377
funding has been hurt by the lack of funding life 
elsewhere. That seems to me to be quite a separate

06:48.417 --> 07:00.812
activity, endeavor, quite a separate 
philosophical issue to planetary science or to

06:48.417 --> 07:00.812
pure science. I've become more and more aware in 
just the last few years that so much science policy

07:01.433 --> 07:19.395
in the United States is politically driven, 
motivated, and controlled that it's almost

07:01.433 --> 07:19.395
independent of the scientific merit of projects 
that we're trying to do. This is certainly true of

07:19.895 --> 07:25.382
big science projects such as planetary 
exploration programs. And most recently, the

07:25.683 --> 07:33.071
program for the search for extraterrestrial 
intelligence, which is such a politically

07:25.683 --> 07:33.071
charged issue. And which has been funded out of 
existence, I guess. In just recent weeks, it has

07:37.076 --> 07:41.000
been funded out of existence, at least at the 
moment. But you see, that political wind can

07:41.621 --> 07:47.948
change directions very quickly and may again. 
What do you think the public thinks about

07:49.890 --> 07:52.213
planetary astronomy? Planetary astronomy in the 
public's view, I think, is a productive and

07:52.717 --> 07:58.464
exciting endeavor. It's gotten a lot of press. 
It's highly amenable to promotion by exciting

08:01.087 --> 08:06.493
results and pictures to go with it. And it, in many 
ways, is the connection point between the public

08:07.374 --> 08:12.500
and astronomical science. It seems to me that as a 
former teacher and as a person who talks publicly

08:12.921 --> 08:22.352
about science quite a bit, that the public has two 
points of connection with astronomy. One is, what

08:22.518 --> 08:28.485
is a black hole, which is a question that comes up at 
nearly every contact with a layperson. And what

08:29.146 --> 08:36.754
are the planets made out of, or some other question 
of comparable interest specifically to solar

08:29.146 --> 08:36.754
system things. And I'd like to punctuate that by 
noting that projects which are primarily

08:37.355 --> 08:50.530
classical astrophysics in nature, such as the 
Hubble Space Telescope, get a tremendous amount

08:37.355 --> 08:50.530
of mileage out of their photographs of the 
planets. And I think that's just fine. I wish our

08:52.572 --> 09:04.347
astrophysics colleagues would acknowledge the 
value of planetary science, if only for its PR

08:52.572 --> 09:04.347
value in that respect. That brings up a point that 
Oren Nix, who's a co-investigator on this, made in

09:04.407 --> 09:10.975
his book, Far Travelers. And it was something that 
I saw when I was at headquarters, that the, quote,

09:12.357 --> 09:20.908
real, unquote, scientists did not want any 
pictures of The theory being that if you could

09:21.074 --> 09:25.359
actually look at something and see right there 
that it wasn't real science. Did you get that

09:25.419 --> 09:26.640
impression? Well, maybe so. Maybe so. I'll

09:29.924 --> 09:43.960
go back to the issue of the composition of the 
surface of Triton and our detection of methane and

09:29.924 --> 09:43.960
nitrogen. The detection of those chemicals on 
Triton's surface essentially at the time that

09:48.530 --> 09:53.615
Voyager was launched in the late 70s, 1977.

09:57.379 --> 10:11.955
Only over the next several years did it become 
apparent that Voyager was actually going to go to

09:57.379 --> 10:11.955
Triton and have a look at this object that I had been 
straining my eyes and telescopes to see for all

09:57.379 --> 10:11.955
those years and to get an up-close look. Now, I had 
pretty much concluded to my satisfaction and the

10:13.235 --> 10:22.791
satisfaction of the other very few colleagues 
interested in the subject of what Triton Circus

10:13.235 --> 10:22.791
would look like when we got there. But to then enjoy 
the extreme thrill of seeing it up close in my own

10:23.472 --> 10:37.856
lifetime, while it was still a topic of scientific 
interest and importance to me, was just about

10:23.472 --> 10:37.856
unparalleled. It did not. by having pictures of 
the surface of this object decrease or diminish

10:39.948 --> 10:47.617
its interest to me or to my colleagues in the 
slightest way. And as I indicated, we've

10:48.097 --> 10:50.480
continued to observe this thing. Even though we 
know in detail what its surface looks like, we've

10:50.821 --> 10:59.431
continued to observe it with ground-based 
telescopes where it remains an unresolved,

10:50.821 --> 10:59.431
faint, distant, cold point of light. Now, how that 
attitude persists with classical

11:00.812 --> 11:05.938
astrophysicists who now can see deep into the core 
of M31 with HST or deep into the cores of jetting

11:06.374 --> 11:18.071
galaxies and other objects of interest to 
astrophysicists? I don't know. I would hope that

11:18.692 --> 11:25.321
they haven't lost their interest and excitement 
in an object just because they can see it better.

11:27.244 --> 11:33.833
What kind of a job do you think Planetary 
Astronomers have done of selling themselves to

11:27.244 --> 11:33.833
the public and to the Congress? Planetary 
astronomers have not dealt well with Congress, in

11:35.045 --> 11:48.959
part because we are naive academics by nature and 
feel that politics and politicians are to be held

11:35.045 --> 11:48.959
at arm's distance. And it's only been in the last 10 
years that we as a profession have become aware of

11:48.979 --> 12:01.272
the necessity to deal with political people and 
political issues because we are a creation of a

11:48.979 --> 12:01.272
political entity. namely the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and are

12:01.555 --> 12:06.201
totally dependent on government funding. People 
in the Congress have told us how naive we are and how

12:07.583 --> 12:13.150
aloof we have appeared to be. On the one hand, 
depending on the Congress and public funding for

12:13.210 --> 12:26.567
our support of our expensive hobbies, and on the 
other hand, being unwilling to deal with

12:13.210 --> 12:26.567
politicians in a real way. So planetary 
scientists have have grown up a bit, I think, in the

12:29.720 --> 12:38.872
last decade or decade and a half through the 
necessity of having to deal with politics and

12:29.720 --> 12:38.872
politicians. So that's probably to the good. It 
isn't any fun. And I particularly don't like it.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.745
But it seems to be a fact of life. I don't think we do 
it very effectively yet. In terms of dealing with

12:52.430 --> 12:54.753
the public, I think we've done quite well. The 
Voyager missions and all the press that was

12:59.690 --> 13:08.101
attendant to those flybys, half a dozen of them, 
was a great experience, a great positive

12:59.690 --> 13:08.101
experience. Pictures of the planets from Voyager 
appeared on the covers of national news magazines

13:08.601 --> 13:13.828
around the world. Planetary scientists were 
interviewed. I was interviewed. And David

13:19.214 --> 13:27.705
Morrison and I, at the time that Pioneer went by 
Saturn, held what I think is the world's only, and

13:19.214 --> 13:27.705
certainly the first, press conference devoted 
entirely to Saturn satellite Iapetus. And so the

13:32.403 --> 13:47.431
public has gotten a dose of some rather arcane 
science through the successes of Voyager and

13:32.403 --> 13:47.431
Pioneer and Viking, of course, and Galileo, and we 
hope that that sequence will continue. I think

13:47.792 --> 13:50.537
we've done well with the public, not so well with 
the politicians. There's been a lot of attention

13:50.973 --> 14:06.409
in the past few years to making planetary 
astronomy a practical science, and there's been a

13:50.973 --> 14:06.409
lot of publicity, certainly, about killer 
asteroids, ozone hole, global warming, search

13:50.973 --> 14:06.409
for extraterrestrial intelligence. I suppose 
that's good for getting money, but do you think

14:06.429 --> 14:09.632
it's been overdone a bit? Well, I'm not sure it has 
been overdone. No, I don't think it has yet. And I'm

14:15.959 --> 14:19.242
not sure that there's any expectation that it will 
be overdone. There is, of course, some concern

14:20.133 --> 14:33.125
about returning to the thrilling days of 
yesteryear when planetary science had a crazy

14:20.133 --> 14:33.125
element, or at least a perceived crazy element, 
namely the diversable lowell types. And that

14:33.145 --> 14:42.534
could happen again if the crazies really did get a 
hold of these various topics.

14:43.295 --> 14:46.258
Planetary scientists have done a pretty good job 
of keeping that from happening. the issue of

14:46.610 --> 14:55.801
impacts on the Earth from comets and so on, has been 
promoted, discussed, and embellished by genuine

14:46.610 --> 14:55.801
scientists. Eugene Shoemaker, David Morrison, 
Clark Chapman, and various other people have been

14:56.803 --> 15:08.457
writing at the popular level and testifying 
before Congress and dealing with NASA committees

14:56.803 --> 15:08.457
in a very professional way. And this, I think, is 
what's keeping it from going crazy. In the SETI

15:12.702 --> 15:13.984
era, into things. We have Jill Tarter, we have 
Frank Drake, we have Carl Sagan, all of whom are

15:15.964 --> 15:24.995
respected, very legitimate scientists dealing 
with these issues. And if we can keep it on that

15:25.195 --> 15:30.081
plane, I think we can keep it under control. What do 
you think the state of planetary astronomy is now?

15:33.525 --> 15:35.207
Going up, going down, hanging in there? Well, the 
state of planetary astronomy now here in the

15:35.287 --> 15:44.038
beginning of fiscal year 94 is continuing to 
decline in terms of of the availability of public

15:44.440 --> 15:48.565
money for it. The National Science Foundation 
supports it at a very, very low level. And may not

15:52.991 --> 15:54.573
continue. And may not continue. NASA funding for 
planetary science is under continual attack,

15:56.115 --> 16:04.746
pressure, let's say, because of the cost of other 
NASA programs. Yet the population of planetary

16:05.447 --> 16:09.151
scientists continues to increase. And that's 
evidenced by the increased attendance of the

16:09.812 --> 16:14.278
Division for Planetary Sciences meetings held 
every year. And the quality of the work that comes

16:15.397 --> 16:19.903
out of those meetings continues to go up. And young 
people are continually attracted to this field,

16:20.023 --> 16:30.616
in spite of the fact that the funding pressure and 
the pressure for other resources continues to

16:20.023 --> 16:30.616
grow. So it's a peculiar situation. And I think 
that the reason that the interest in it continues

16:33.140 --> 16:44.434
to grow is because of its intrinsic value, its 
intrinsic interest, and its intrinsic relevance

16:33.140 --> 16:44.434
to understanding The Earth is a planet. 
Somebody's getting their bachelor's degree, and

16:46.660 --> 16:51.905
they're interested in planetary astronomy. What 
do you say to them? I say that your prospects for

16:54.308 --> 16:59.253
getting a job and support are not particularly 
good. But if you are driven to do this, for the same

16:59.934 --> 17:07.161
reasons that I was driven as a 13- or 14-year-old 
kid to do it, then go ahead. Give it your best shot.

17:08.242 --> 17:12.226
Well, that was actually the situation for 
astronomy in general when we were under Richard.

17:12.246 --> 17:14.168
That's right, in a way. We were not encouraged to go 
into astronomy because there was any sense of

17:14.705 --> 17:25.357
lucrative employment or even a guarantee of any 
job or anything of the kind. And information

17:26.298 --> 17:40.273
distributed to random inquirers by the American 
Astronomical Society when I was a kid said such

17:26.298 --> 17:40.273
things as, there is very little room in astronomy 
for people of marginal ability. And that's

17:41.300 --> 17:42.882
probably still true. I consider myself a person of 
marginal ability, but I had super marginal

17:43.243 --> 17:56.360
persistence and dedication, and I had to become an 
astronomer. And so I did, and I've been able to do it

17:56.580 --> 18:00.065
reasonably successfully. Before there was even 
an NASA. Before there was, yes. And so I would tell a

18:03.449 --> 18:10.378
person in the situation you just described that if 
you have to do this, then you have to do it. and

18:10.645 --> 18:14.049
somehow you and the rest of us will find a way. And so 
when I find such a person with that kind of

18:14.809 --> 18:33.649
dedication and devotion, I do my very best to make 
them feel welcome in this profession, to help them

18:14.809 --> 18:33.649
both professionally and at the technical level, 
and try to get them involved, because that's where

18:14.809 --> 18:33.649
the discoveries will come from, is the people who 
are driven to do it. The death of the Mars Observer

18:34.510 --> 18:37.733
Probe to me at least, seem to come as a shock to a lot 
of people that have been in this field for only 10 or

18:38.962 --> 18:44.467
20 years. We both remember when failures of 
planetary and lunar probes were the norm rather

18:46.949 --> 18:53.035
than the exception. Do you think this is a good slap 
in the face to wake some people up? Well, in a way,

19:00.281 --> 19:06.387
it's a slap in the face in many respects. Or a dash of 
cold water. A dash of cold water. It certainly

19:09.959 --> 19:19.391
shows that one can't be sanguine about the 
successes from complicated, expensive space

19:09.959 --> 19:19.391
probes. The Vikings kind of worked, and the 
Voyagers kind of worked, and I think people got fat

19:19.431 --> 19:24.958
and happy. Yes, we did. One of the most serious 
elements of this now, of course, is that there are

19:26.440 --> 19:34.230
very few other spacecraft programs that are 
flying or expected to fly in a reasonable amount of

19:34.615 --> 19:39.483
time. Whereas in the 70s and 80s, there were 
programs under development more or less

19:40.304 --> 19:52.122
continuously, and at least the prospect of flying 
was not too remote or too distant. So young people

19:52.823 --> 20:01.517
coming into the field, and also we were going to 
planets that were relatively close by and didn't

19:52.823 --> 20:01.517
take forever to get there. So the situation is 
different now in that a person who has just been

20:02.543 --> 20:21.845
terminated in a funding sense by the failure of 
Mars Observer doesn't necessarily have any

20:02.543 --> 20:21.845
prospects on the immediate horizon to pick them up 
and to keep them actively employed and

20:02.543 --> 20:21.845
scientifically productive in the intervening 
years. That's a very serious problem because some

20:21.885 --> 20:28.853
of these people will be forced to drift away into 
other fields just because of the lack of support.

20:29.193 --> 20:31.656
There is no buffer program which can pick them up. 
This is a leading question, and it calls for a

20:31.889 --> 20:36.433
personal answer. I have heard it said at DPS 
meetings that we need planetary probes to keep the

20:37.474 --> 20:47.424
scientists interested. And my very feeling 
always was that if the scientists were supposed to

20:48.205 --> 20:55.973
generate the interest themselves, whether they 
have probes or not. Your comments? Well, I tend to

20:59.024 --> 21:14.608
feel, as I think you do, that the intrinsic merit of 
this science will generate the interest on the

20:59.024 --> 21:14.608
part of people truly devoted to planetary 
studies, independent of the probes. The probes

21:14.908 --> 21:22.019
provide the very, very important... Stuff that we 
otherwise couldn't get at all. Things that we

21:22.039 --> 21:24.423
cannot do in any other way, that's true. But we've 
already seen just a few days ago that... work from

21:28.066 --> 21:45.792
essentially images of Mars from the distance of 
the Earth, taken in the proper way, in this case

21:28.066 --> 21:45.792
with the Hubble Space Telescope, but also from the 
ground, can still produce important science,

21:28.066 --> 21:45.792
despite the fact that we've been to Mars with a 
number of orbiters and two landers from the United

21:28.066 --> 21:45.792
States and so on. So there's still a lot of work that 
can be done on the planets, but some of it simply

21:46.173 --> 21:50.739
cannot be done without probes. Nonetheless, 
there are many compelling planetary problems

21:56.686 --> 22:06.198
that will keep real scientists interested 
indefinitely into the future, even if there is

21:56.686 --> 22:06.198
never another planetary probe. The field will 
shrink, of course, and there will be a smaller

22:06.218 --> 22:25.343
number of people doing it, but the people who are 
driven to understand the solar system, its

22:06.218 --> 22:25.343
nature, and its relationship to other systems of 
stars and dust and things in our galaxy and

22:06.218 --> 22:25.343
elsewhere will do this work no matter what. One 
last and leading question. I was going to say, what

22:29.165 --> 22:34.892
do you think, in the last 30 years, the greatest 
development in planetary astronomy has been? But

22:34.932 --> 22:41.559
I'm reminded of the fact that when we were 
students, there were the gas giants and then there

22:34.932 --> 22:41.559
were the terrestrial planets. And we didn't 
realize there's a whole different kind of planet,

22:42.040 --> 22:49.268
the ice planets and all that sort of stuff. Do you 
think that is the most important thing we found

22:49.288 --> 22:52.011
out? Or do you have your particular candidate? I 
think it's very important that we've discovered

22:55.765 --> 23:05.296
that each planet is its own kind and that there is 
this vast collection of icy bodies in the outer

22:55.765 --> 23:05.296
solar system. But I'm inclined to think that the 
most important realization is that it's a picture

23:05.316 --> 23:20.353
that's still evolving and emerging and a picture 
to which not all planetary scientists have yet

23:05.316 --> 23:20.353
signed up. And that is our connection to 
interstellar space to other material elsewhere

23:24.065 --> 23:26.508
in the galaxy. I'm particularly impressed by the 
detection of organic material in the solar

23:27.189 --> 23:44.074
system, even in the inner solar system, that 
clearly had its origins on the grains of

23:27.189 --> 23:44.074
interstellar dust among the stars in the diffused 
interstellar medium. This material, some of it

23:44.094 --> 23:52.165
has come into the solar system relatively 
unaltered, and we're just beginning to detect and

23:44.094 --> 23:52.165
understand that. Other of that material has been 
highly altered, and we are some of that stuff.
