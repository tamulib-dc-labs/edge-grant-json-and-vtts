WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:08.649
When he, he always put the game plan on paper, and we 
spent the entire week going over it. And when the

00:08.669 --> 00:18.640
game plan came, I mean, I knew from the thing that he 
said, it's almost exactly what he wanted me to do. I

00:18.740 --> 00:23.925
mean, we, Coach Spiler was almost the opposite. I 
mean, he tried to, I mean, He wanted to give you all

00:27.588 --> 00:31.272
the freedom in the world. I wasn't used to that. I 
liked it when Coach Martin would tell you what to

00:36.839 --> 00:44.028
do. In certain situations, this is what you do. I 
had no problem playing. I was in better health.

00:50.896 --> 00:54.540
Things were going better.

00:58.013 --> 01:07.587
I just thought Coach Martin

00:58.013 --> 01:07.587
was about as good as he came.

01:07.607 --> 01:18.183
Football in those days was so primitive compared

01:07.607 --> 01:18.183
to what he is now that there was no companion. It was 
beginning to get a little bit more complex toward

01:18.203 --> 01:23.852
my junior senior year.

01:26.785 --> 01:32.995
I guess I just didn't adapt as well. Go through a 
typical week's workouts. Well.

01:43.472 --> 01:44.233
During the season. Monday, Tuesday was the, 
Monday we generally would review what had

01:44.253 --> 01:53.147
happened the day, the week before. And then, it was 
not a too much, too heavy a workout, and we began to

01:53.735 --> 02:12.397
practice in sort of a non-contact way what we were 
gonna do the next week. And then on Tuesday, we

02:12.417 --> 02:21.868
generally, that was our hardest practice, and we 
would try to practice as near under game

02:22.658 --> 02:30.547
conditions as we could, the things that we were 
going to do, and then we kind of eased up. And

02:30.627 --> 02:34.111
Tuesday's practice would be about how long in 
duration? Tuesday's practice sometimes would be

02:34.292 --> 02:39.157
until it got so dark that you couldn't see. And

02:41.059 --> 02:51.872
Wednesdays and Thursdays were lighter, and 
Friday was just kind of a walkthrough.

02:52.949 --> 03:15.534
That

02:52.949 --> 03:15.534
first year with Coach Norton, as soon as my 
afternoon classes were over, and I only had a

02:52.949 --> 03:15.534
couple, I'd break my neck to get down there, and 
we'd sit down and he'd talk to us. Sometimes it

03:16.094 --> 03:21.420
would just be me, and sometimes it would be a couple 
of us, and sometimes it would be all of us. And we

03:23.510 --> 03:29.899
would sit in his office and talk with him until the 
time to go to practice. Describe his ethics.

03:34.646 --> 03:47.905
I just have to say that I never saw or heard of 
anything he did that

03:34.646 --> 03:47.905
was questionable at all. In fact, he told me one 
time we were sitting up there by DeWare

03:54.323 --> 03:55.765
Fieldhouse. And he said, this is toward the end of 
my, my leg was broken. And that's why, I guess why I

04:02.093 --> 04:05.238
happened to be sitting there by him. But he said, I

04:05.818 --> 04:12.127
made two mistakes at A&M. He said, the first one was 
after the 1940 season. He said, I had a chance to go

04:16.513 --> 04:20.358
to USC. I said, I didn't take it. He said, if I had to 
do over again, I would go to the USC. So the second

04:28.507 --> 04:42.905
mistake I made was when the war was over, everybody 
that was on scholarship at A&M, when they came

04:28.507 --> 04:42.905
back, I didn't have a scholarship. And that 
included guys like Luke Simmons that couldn't

04:42.925 --> 04:45.969
walk. He said, if I had to do over again, I'd do it 
again. You know, that's the kind of guy he was. Did

04:56.014 --> 05:03.823
you get any impression of his feelings about the 
other Southwest Conference coaches at that time?

05:04.824 --> 05:06.206
How did he feel about them? No, I don't know. I 
certainly didn't get any feeling of animosity.

05:16.078 --> 05:19.562
I have the impression that they were friends. 
Yeah, I think they were. That they knew each other.

05:22.008 --> 05:29.235
They had been in it for a long, you know, there was 
Dutch Meyer, TCU, and was it Rice? Just Neely. Just

05:30.597 --> 05:32.178
Neely and Rice. Matty Bell. Matty Bell at SMU. And 
Bible. And Bible at Austin. And Kimbrough was at

05:40.086 --> 05:42.569
Baylor. And Barnhill was at. And those guys, 
they'd all been there for years. And Coach

05:53.163 --> 05:57.727
Norton's private life was not questionable, was 
it? Not that I know

05:57.747 --> 06:02.131
of. All right, let's see. Back to people that made 
an impression on you. Were there any, you said Mr.

06:06.135 --> 06:10.479
Penberthy. Describe him as the leader of the 
Department of Physical Education. Well, of

06:15.297 --> 06:29.314
course, Mr.

06:15.297 --> 06:29.314
Penney was the one guy I know that I believe he, I 
honestly believe he knew every student in the

06:15.297 --> 06:29.314
school. And he knew a lot about a lot of people. The 
main

06:34.580 --> 06:41.849
part of the P.E. department was the required P.E. 
along with that intramural program. Of course,

06:48.330 --> 06:56.379
the intramural program was pretty much under the 
physical education program at that time. This was

06:56.399 --> 07:03.426
one place where everybody had a good time. The P.E. 
was recreation. It wasn't so much, it wasn't

07:05.349 --> 07:11.275
drudgery at all. Most of us were young enough, we 
still liked to play, and that's what D.E. was all

07:16.781 --> 07:17.422
about.

07:20.225 --> 07:22.167
Of course, a lot of it was competitive. I mean, 
during the war, they started the mile and

07:22.187 --> 07:32.578
seven-tenths run, you know, and the swimming.

07:36.262 --> 07:41.768
Most of us really enjoyed D.E. professional PE 
department, for those of us that were PE majors, it

07:42.102 --> 08:04.574
was like, well, there was no school of education at 
A&M, you know, and the PE department, there were

07:42.102 --> 08:04.574
about three or four professors, and in the 
Department of Education, there were only three.

08:04.594 --> 08:06.016
And who were those key people? Well, let's see, Mr. 
Dowd,

08:19.582 --> 08:40.927
Well,

08:19.582 --> 08:40.927
while you're thinking about it, this young guy who 
would later become a Southwest Conference

08:19.582 --> 08:40.927
football referee, Carl Landis. That's who it was. 
Oh, OK. Did you have any courses with Carl? Yes.

08:44.792 --> 08:45.893
Describe him as a teacher. Dr. Landis was the most 
professional P.E. teacher we had. And he worked

08:53.683 --> 09:07.242
more at trying to get us as physical education 
majors to be academicians and professional. He's

09:08.103 --> 09:10.306
the first, he's the only one in the P.E. department 
who would have a paper to write would require you to

09:10.366 --> 09:16.555
footnote it and he was Highly professional. And I 
always appreciated him for that. He probably had

09:24.071 --> 09:34.246
more influence on us as

09:24.071 --> 09:34.246
future professional people than anybody. Was he 
already officiating? Yes, he was officiating.

09:37.831 --> 09:45.502
And he was pretty influential in getting a lot of us 
to start in officiating. Oh, really? Now did you do

09:47.028 --> 09:48.569
some officiating too? I did until I started 
coaching and then, you know, officiating and

09:48.589 --> 09:52.032
coaching. That's what I thought. Can't hardly do 
that. And did he have any impression on your

09:54.654 --> 09:58.318
brother to be? Well, I don't know exactly how it 
really got started. I know Barney Welch was

10:01.981 --> 10:10.108
probably,

10:01.981 --> 10:10.108
I know he was officiating by that time. And

10:10.128 --> 10:16.393
they had a, and they may still have a, a pretty 
active chapter of the Southwest Football Fishers

10:16.728 --> 10:22.093
Association here. Dr. Landis was president of it. 
So, Taylor Wilkins was another one. He was

10:27.018 --> 10:32.463
president of the, that was active in the Fishers 
Association.

10:35.787 --> 10:37.368
He's on the school board here.

10:40.611 --> 10:43.955
Not Bob Nelson, but Bob Nelson's son. What's his 
name? Anyway, he was an old bailer boy, and he was

10:47.187 --> 10:54.914
active.

10:55.375 --> 10:55.835
Let's see. After the war, did you do much 
socializing as a student? Well, yeah. Of course,

11:04.684 --> 11:09.709
there was still, it was all men. And most of the 
socializing was men kind of thing. They'd drink

11:16.786 --> 11:17.767
beer. Where? Triangle. Okay. And there was a 
drive-in over here next to what's now the Ford

11:22.855 --> 11:28.683
place. And

11:30.065 --> 11:39.779
if you weren't going to eat on campus, where would 
you go to eat a... Eat a hamburger? Or a hamburger or

11:39.799 --> 11:41.962
a barbecue or whatever? Well, let's see... There

11:46.553 --> 11:54.466
were a couple of places at the north gate. There was 
one place up above the Lipscomb Pharmacy. And it

12:03.160 --> 12:06.025
went through several stages. It was a pool hall and 
a beer joint. a hamburger place, but our fare was

12:11.512 --> 12:20.820
generally hamburgers and chicken fried steak. 
There were two, there were two or three

12:20.840 --> 12:33.052
restaurants in Bryan, the City Cafe and the Bryan 
Cafe, that we frequented, particularly, they

12:20.840 --> 12:33.052
sailed late. And I remember Leon Hale, wrote a 
column in the, I think it was, I guess it was in the

12:41.195 --> 12:59.620
Chronicle, since he's been in the Chronicle, 
might have been maybe with the Post, but about

12:41.195 --> 12:59.620
trying to find enchiladas like they made at the 
Pacific Cafe in Ryan. Was there any place of shady

12:59.640 --> 13:05.748
reputation that anybody went to after the war? 
Well, yeah, there were a couple of, beer joints out

13:09.730 --> 13:16.440
here

13:09.730 --> 13:16.440
on the highway. The Navels, there were two beers, 
right where 21 and 6 cross. North End of town. North

13:23.050 --> 13:24.092
End of town. Where it's now Texas Avenue and 
Highway 21, where they cross. Right where the

13:28.218 --> 13:36.210
Wieners is, there was a big beer joint and right 
across Texas 21 and that was another one and one of

13:37.456 --> 14:05.792
them was navels and i don't know what i can't 
remember and then there was a there's a place out

13:37.456 --> 14:05.792
just across the river on 21 called the avalon and if 
you were going to drink hard liquor that's where

13:37.456 --> 14:05.792
you went because the liquor store was across the 
river all right now i met a man when i was in high

13:37.456 --> 14:05.792
school in orange because i'm a couple years 
younger than you and he had once been over in one of

14:06.278 --> 14:17.333
those places when the Air Force Base was there, and 
his expertise was in gambling and so forth. He was a

14:17.614 --> 14:19.056
dealer and all that. Was there any of that out there 
near the air base? I'm sure there was, but... Was

14:22.881 --> 14:25.685
there ever? There were several. The Avalon was a 
nightclub. Okay. And there were several other

14:32.554 --> 14:34.397
places out there. I'm sure there... that you could 
place a bed if you wanted to. That wasn't much of my

14:41.794 --> 14:50.381
thing, so I'm not too familiar with it. I can 
remember some of the guys talking about playing

14:50.401 --> 14:54.705
poker. And Whiskey Bridge, straight out Highway 
6,

14:56.527 --> 15:05.074
was that liquor store yet there? Going the way to 
Snook? Yeah, yeah.

15:11.763 --> 15:14.446
It's just been leveled within the last two years. 
Just the old building? Yeah. But it used to be on

15:16.689 --> 15:20.294
the, I mean, that was the new building. There was 
one on the other side of the highway. Oh, okay. They

15:24.539 --> 15:25.801
were just a little frame. Yeah. But I guess they 
probably did pretty well financially. Yeah,

15:32.530 --> 15:33.150
let's see. MSC wasn't finished. when you 
graduated, was it? No. Religious Census Week, was

15:38.962 --> 15:40.525
it? It was. Was it? I think, I think my dad had a hand 
in starting it. Okay. And it was going on while you

15:50.323 --> 15:52.347
were a student? Oh yeah, yeah. And I can remember a 
couple of guys I remember one of the men, I believe

15:59.948 --> 16:12.601
his name was Bill

15:59.948 --> 16:12.601
Peterson from Oklahoma City. I think that was his 
name. But this is, I believe, let's see, this must

16:13.702 --> 16:19.508
have been about 1948 or not. It was during the time 
when

16:20.970 --> 16:29.719
President Gilchrist was having so much trouble 
with and the Federals. And my dad was looking for a

16:33.589 --> 16:37.253
speaker. Were you familiar with the way religions 
speak? You know, they would have a main speaker and

16:42.217 --> 16:49.924
then they would bring in representatives from all 
faiths and they'd meet in small groups. But the

16:50.365 --> 16:57.411
main speaker was the one that my dad was always 
worried about, at least vocally. At home, he would

16:58.471 --> 17:04.076
talk about, you know, who could he get? I'm almost 
sure this guy named Bill Peterson. He was the

17:07.579 --> 17:11.302
minister of the Christian church in the city. And 
he had been a prize fighter,

17:13.024 --> 17:25.195
nightclub agency, and had all sorts of 
experiences. And anyway, My dad contacted him,

17:28.424 --> 17:36.132
and he explained to him the problems that were 
happening on the campus. And he says, I don't know

17:36.152 --> 17:44.500
if anybody will attend these services or not. And 
he says, I'll tell you what. You get 100 people in

17:47.884 --> 17:57.874
the auditorium the first day I preach, and I 
guarantee you it'll be full. Anyway, to make a long

17:59.339 --> 18:15.057
story short, he came down here and they had the,

17:59.339 --> 18:15.057
the first Sunday, I mean the first, on Monday they 
turned out 10 o'clock classes into 11 o'clock, you

17:59.339 --> 18:15.057
know. And this was at Guyon? This was at Guyon Hall. 
And they had a pretty good crowd the first day. The

18:22.306 --> 18:28.333
downstairs

18:22.306 --> 18:28.333
was mostly full. a few people upstairs, and he 
preached. And the next day, the next four services

18:32.600 --> 18:38.126
was standing room only. I mean, he delivered. And 
the first thing he said, the first, I remember the

18:40.229 --> 18:52.683
first, they had all the, they had all the ministers 
from the, on the stage, and they introduced him.

18:52.703 --> 18:58.270
And he was a great big guy, you know, like 6'4", 
maybe weighed 2, 25, 35. And the first thing he

18:59.195 --> 19:08.609
said, he asked Joe Boyd, the former All-American, 
the Reverend Joe Boyd, to stand up. He says, I want

19:08.870 --> 19:15.580
to arm wrestle you right here. They didn't do it, 
but that was the first thing he said. And then the

19:19.045 --> 19:28.459
things that he said to him just appealed to the 
entire student body, I guess. He was highly

19:29.047 --> 19:32.932
successful. And they had two or three others that 
were, I mean, one man was the,

19:32.952 --> 19:44.589
was a Presbyterian. And he was, what is he, at the 
Congress? Oh, the chaplain for the- The chaplain

19:51.739 --> 19:56.185
for the Synagogue. congressional chaplain at one 
time, and he was from California. I thought I'd

20:02.963 --> 20:08.509
never forget his name either, but obviously my 
mind ain't going. But anyway, he came in, he was a

20:08.529 --> 20:17.278
whole lot more serious, but he was, the religious 
emphasis weeks were really pretty successful.

20:17.558 --> 20:18.159
Did you go? Oh, absolutely. I enjoyed it. In fact, 
you know, there were so few places for people to The

20:26.557 --> 20:32.803
MSE wasn't there, and the LaSalle Hotel was kind of 
going down the drain. And my dad kept the minister,

20:32.823 --> 20:40.770
the primary speaker, at home. Let's see, now there 
was a little Aggie, what was it called across from

20:40.790 --> 20:44.554
Sabisa? Was it called the Aggie Land Inn? Aggie 
Land Inn, yeah. And it had about how many rooms?

20:52.782 --> 20:54.083
Was there any other people? motel of any sort in 
College Station? Well, I think that's the blue top

20:58.362 --> 21:02.468
tourist court. And it was strictly a tourist 
court. It was at the East Gate. So there weren't any

21:08.735 --> 21:15.564
night football games, so that the football, the 
visiting team, didn't spend the night here. No.

21:16.965 --> 21:19.549
They generally came on the train that morning. 
Where did a basketball team go? I don't know. I've

21:27.132 --> 21:28.033
never thought about that. So the other place to 
stay was at the La Salle Hotel, wasn't it? Yeah. I

21:36.964 --> 21:41.389
really don't know where they stayed. I really 
don't. I

21:42.691 --> 21:48.438
just never thought about that. When you were a 
freshman before you go away to the war, Where do

21:53.362 --> 21:55.405
you, where did you get a date? Well, I was fortunate 
enough to have a girlfriend that, that whose folks

21:57.208 --> 22:03.857
lived here. Oh, okay. Okay. Then when you come 
back? When I came back, she was at Sophia Newcomb in

22:08.144 --> 22:11.709
New Orleans. Okay. And so I was in the same category 
with everybody else. We just kind of, there

22:14.873 --> 22:19.420
weren't many girls, you know, but there, The kid, 
when we were in high school, if a girl started

22:21.188 --> 22:29.856
dating an Aggie, then the high school kids 
wouldn't have an Aggie. Yeah, she's too

22:29.896 --> 22:48.293
highfalutin for us, you know, and so when you, when 
we got out of high school, we got an A&M, well then

22:29.896 --> 22:48.293
the role was reversed if, you know, and we tried to, 
we tried to date the high school girls, and to a

22:29.896 --> 22:48.293
point, when we got out of When we came back after the 
service, the girls from here that we knew were in

22:50.500 --> 23:05.038
college, Austin or

22:50.500 --> 23:05.038
Denton, for the most part. And so we were just in the 
same boat with everybody else. If you had a date on

23:09.563 --> 23:16.592
the weekend, you either had to go to Austin or 
Denton, or sometimes they'd come home. We had a

23:17.956 --> 23:27.011
pretty good leg up on a lot of guys when these were 
on. Now, were the Tesses coming down here on the

23:27.031 --> 23:32.921
train on those special weekends before the war? 
I'm sure they were, yeah. I know they, even after

23:36.628 --> 23:43.980
the war, What I'm thinking about, when A&M would 
play SMU or TCU, they would come down here on the

23:45.445 --> 24:03.882
train the morning of the ball

23:45.445 --> 24:03.882
game. And the reason I know that is that Dope 
Walker's dad was at Austin College when my dad was

24:04.002 --> 24:14.191
up there. Oh, yes. ULD Walker. And he and my dad 
remained friends. When I was a senior and I, no,

24:23.966 --> 24:35.803
when I was a freshman at A&M, when we had the 
football banter, my dad invited Dope to come down

24:23.966 --> 24:35.803
and go to the football banter with us. Dope was the 
year behind us. He was a senior at Holland Park. And

24:43.107 --> 24:56.603
so he came down and spent the weekend at our house 
and went to the football banquet and two days after

24:43.107 --> 24:56.603
the football banquet is when I had to report to the 
Army. But Bill went back to SMU and he went in the

24:56.623 --> 25:12.321
service and he went down to, he was at Brooks Army 
Base in San Antonio And it was so far for him to go

25:12.487 --> 25:21.438
home on the weekends that several times he came 
over and spent the weekend with my folks while he

25:12.487 --> 25:21.438
was in the service. And I was in the service. I was 
gone. And I never did. I didn't know it, except my

25:25.182 --> 25:31.229
mother would write and tell me to go and spend the 
weekend with them. Well, after the war, we played

25:31.249 --> 25:36.535
SMU three times. One time, I was on crutches and 
didn't get to play. And we played up here once and in

25:42.727 --> 25:48.072
Dallas once. But when the train came down from 
Dallas with the SMU team on it, I went over and I

25:48.092 --> 25:55.760
wanted to speak to him. Every time I saw that guy

25:55.780 --> 26:07.071
after the war, the first thing he wanted to know was 
how my mom was doing. That's just how he had to be.

26:09.338 --> 26:22.973
And

26:09.338 --> 26:22.973
I met him twice at the station here when the SMU team 
was coming in just to shake hands with him. That's

26:24.074 --> 26:27.098
the impression everybody that I've ever talked 
to. That's right. That's the only impression I've

26:27.458 --> 26:30.081
ever heard of him. The Missouri team, Missouri 
broke the 15-game undefeated streak up there. And

26:38.903 --> 26:54.688
after the game is over, the Missouri quarterback, 
a superb guy named Buss Insminger, who is of the

26:38.903 --> 26:54.688
same quality of human being as Doak, he leads the 
whole Missouri team over to talk to Doak to tell him

26:38.903 --> 26:54.688
what a superb game he's played. And they start 
talking, and pretty soon the SMU team goes to Matty

26:56.170 --> 27:06.767
Bell and tells him that the Missouri guys have 
asked them if they could stay and go to the danced

27:07.135 --> 27:09.157
that night in Columbia. And they said, coach, 
could the train just wait? And so they did. And I've

27:14.124 --> 27:23.275
shared that with a number of people to say, can you 
imagine today, after all of the cheap talk, two

27:14.124 --> 27:23.275
teams talking like that? Then Doak's father got an 
honorary degree at Austin College while I was

27:25.377 --> 27:30.564
there. I got to be one of the student marshals. And 
here comes Doak Walker. And no, no, no, they

27:36.430 --> 27:39.936
wouldn't accept special seats. No, no, no, we're 
just like anybody else. Just let us be seated. And I

27:44.624 --> 27:47.849
thought, what a splendid, splendid family.

27:51.234 --> 27:57.004
Let

27:51.234 --> 27:57.004
me stop there, and we'll renew this.
