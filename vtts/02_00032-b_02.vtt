WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:06.056
Did they ever put an animal in your room?

00:06.516 --> 00:07.077
No.

00:07.097 --> 00:08.119
Any Babbo bombs?

00:09.741 --> 00:10.042
No.

00:10.543 --> 00:11.745
I don't know what that is.

00:11.885 --> 00:14.689
Oh, take a can of Babbo and put a cherry bomb in it?

00:15.050 --> 00:15.210
No.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.514
And put it in your room and blow Babbo everywhere?

00:17.694 --> 00:19.637
No.

00:21.300 --> 00:28.030
Things got more serious as the war started.

00:28.448 --> 00:33.054
Did you all listen to the radio regularly to hear the news of what was happening?

00:33.094 --> 00:33.435
Yes.

00:34.676 --> 00:41.185
Did you ever hear many reports of some of your acquaintances that had already gone away to war?

00:41.265 --> 00:42.807
Did you all ever hear much from them?

00:43.868 --> 00:53.641
We get letters and occasional phone calls, but seldom, and usually they were still in the States.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.283
They weren't overseas.

00:57.068 --> 01:01.875
During this time, what did you and your buddies think about the Aggie band?

01:01.975 --> 01:03.738
What image did it have?

01:04.239 --> 01:05.220
Very good image.

01:05.240 --> 01:08.125
They were the grandest band that I am.

01:10.188 --> 01:11.229
What about the Yale leaders?

01:13.793 --> 01:17.659
We had four Yale leaders, two juniors, two seniors.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.532
We liked our yell leaders.

01:21.353 --> 01:25.257
Was that a big image task, to be a yell leader?

01:27.500 --> 01:28.461
Yes, it was.

01:28.601 --> 01:36.590
I don't think it was quite as big as being president of the class, but it was a good one to be a yell leader.

01:37.070 --> 01:40.634
Now, the biggest student leadership role was to be corps commander?

01:40.815 --> 01:41.115
Right.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.889
How was the Corps commander selected as far as you knew?

01:44.929 --> 01:49.556
It was selected by the attack officers.

01:51.158 --> 01:52.800
And how they did it, I don't know.

01:53.141 --> 01:58.028
As far as you all knew, did the Corps commanders, did they deserve that role?

02:02.615 --> 02:05.719
I think pretty much so.

02:07.724 --> 02:12.451
The Corps commander was always a well thought of person.

02:14.634 --> 02:26.912
He was a good, he made good grades and he was clean cut, nothing bad about him.

02:27.834 --> 02:36.887
He wasn't always the popular guy, but he was, you could admire and respect his record.

02:37.340 --> 02:40.505
When you, what was your task as a junior?

02:41.546 --> 02:43.169
I was top kick of the outfit.

02:43.189 --> 02:44.150
Top kick.

02:44.170 --> 02:45.913
Who made that choice, do you know?

02:46.454 --> 02:47.215
The seniors.

02:48.457 --> 02:51.721
How did, were you, was there an interview?

02:51.741 --> 02:53.544
No, no.

02:54.105 --> 02:55.627
How did you learn you'd been selected?

02:56.509 --> 03:02.858
On Mother's Day they called me out and we were in the thing.

03:03.496 --> 03:06.860
And they had called my mother and father and told them to come down.

03:07.381 --> 03:07.821
Oh.

03:07.841 --> 03:09.663
And I didn't know they were there.

03:09.683 --> 03:12.647
And I was presented the best drill medal.

03:13.308 --> 03:14.249
Oh.

03:14.990 --> 03:23.560
And the guy that gets the best drill medal was the guy that they made top kick his junior year and COO his senior year.

03:23.720 --> 03:30.448
What did mom and dad say when they got, what did they tell you when you got that honor?

03:30.563 --> 03:48.050
Uh, they just, mother said that I've forgotten she's been more, but dad said, well, son, uh, you're tending to your business and, uh, keep it up.

03:49.452 --> 03:51.495
And, uh, you've made a good record here.

03:52.376 --> 03:52.977
Keep it up.

03:54.357 --> 04:01.147
and keep tending to your business and conduct yourself so people admire and respect you.

04:02.649 --> 04:04.632
Keep it up.

04:05.293 --> 04:11.022
Did you think then that that was the big step toward becoming the outfit CO?

04:11.042 --> 04:11.843
Oh, you knew that.

04:11.963 --> 04:17.411
That was our routine, at least in the Coast Artillery.

04:19.434 --> 04:22.238
The Coast Artillery, when y'all drilled,

04:22.555 --> 04:24.838
Did y'all drill with some artillery?

04:25.398 --> 04:25.678
No.

04:28.141 --> 04:30.984
Ours was real just for competition drill.

04:31.245 --> 04:31.525
Okay.

04:32.426 --> 04:41.216
No, no, I mean when you all had training, like the cavalry trained with horses, what did y'all train with?

04:41.236 --> 04:42.737
Well, we had guns.

04:43.138 --> 04:43.458
Really?

04:43.598 --> 04:46.502
Yeah, we had guns in the back of the petroleum building.

04:46.702 --> 04:47.102
Okay.

04:47.883 --> 04:52.208
They had anti-aircraft guns and had machine guns.

04:52.424 --> 04:54.266
Did y'all ever fire blanks?

04:54.647 --> 04:56.228
Not, no.

04:56.248 --> 04:59.372
We just went through the routine of setting them up.

05:00.473 --> 05:04.057
What was the nickname for Coast Artillery, or was there one?

05:05.599 --> 05:06.620
I don't believe there was.

05:09.163 --> 05:15.631
For you and your buddies, was there any part of the Corps that y'all thought was the most superior?

05:16.492 --> 05:17.453
Yes.

05:17.770 --> 05:19.772
What had the highest prestige?

05:19.932 --> 05:20.973
Coast artillery.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.455
What had the lowest?

05:26.159 --> 05:29.142
I'd probably say quartermaster corps.

05:29.182 --> 05:30.864
We call them the services corps.

05:30.884 --> 05:36.630
It's quartermaster and what, signal corps?

05:36.730 --> 05:37.290
What was it?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.332
Signal corps.

05:38.352 --> 05:38.632
Yes, sir.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.232
Yeah.

05:39.973 --> 05:45.499
What, as you and your buddies talked about the war, coast artillery,

05:45.817 --> 05:49.941
What did you all think you all would be called upon to do during the war?

05:51.663 --> 05:59.852
Well, of course the artillery had anti-aircraft and that's what we spent our big time training on, anti-aircraft fire.

06:01.213 --> 06:14.187
And that we'd be doing that and... During those early years, do you remember going to muster?

06:14.977 --> 06:16.760
On the campus, Aggie Muster?

06:16.780 --> 06:16.900
Yes.

06:17.381 --> 06:18.222
Where was it held?

06:20.967 --> 06:23.010
I think it was held at the stadium.

06:25.514 --> 06:29.100
I'm fuzzy, but I think it was held at the stadium.

06:29.541 --> 06:33.788
Did you all hear about the Muster on Corregidor?

06:35.290 --> 06:35.691
Yes.

06:35.711 --> 06:36.792
The famous one in 1942?

06:37.053 --> 06:38.054
Yeah, yeah.

06:38.676 --> 06:39.617
We heard about it.

06:41.150 --> 06:49.501
Because as far as I can tell from these interviews, muster was kind of a small event until World War II.

06:49.861 --> 06:51.143
Until the war started.

06:51.163 --> 06:53.526
And then it really became significant.

06:53.546 --> 06:54.127
Yeah.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.590
It was held all over the country.

06:57.491 --> 06:57.792
Right.

06:58.613 --> 07:08.065
As this routine of activities changed, when did you buy your senior ring?

07:08.405 --> 07:08.946
Do you remember?

07:09.989 --> 07:13.974
When I became a senior, you could buy the ring.

07:14.795 --> 07:22.444
If you had to be classified as a senior, you could buy the ring, but you wore it inverted inside out.

07:26.348 --> 07:27.329
Can you see that?

07:27.570 --> 07:27.930
Yes, sir.

07:28.271 --> 07:29.692
Can you read anything on it?

07:29.712 --> 07:31.074
No, it looks like it's been worn.

07:31.795 --> 07:32.536
Yes.

07:32.736 --> 07:33.597
That's your original?

07:33.877 --> 07:35.439
That's my original.

07:35.459 --> 07:36.640
Do you remember what it cost?

07:37.181 --> 07:38.022
$21.

07:38.322 --> 07:39.364
Where'd you get that, Tony?

07:39.384 --> 07:40.166
Was that your money?

07:40.367 --> 07:40.828
Yes.

07:41.509 --> 07:56.905
I spent one summer, let's see, a summer between my freshman and sophomore years, between my sophomore and junior years, I worked in the oil field.

07:58.083 --> 08:03.230
And uh, I was roused about one year and roughneck the next year.

08:03.270 --> 08:12.183
And uh, I really, I was going with the girl that I married, my first wife, the wife that died.

08:12.223 --> 08:22.858
And uh, I was working in the summertime and putting away money and going to have enough money to uh,

08:24.577 --> 08:27.101
be able to get married.

08:27.582 --> 08:32.369
And, of course, uh, and that's the way it happened.

08:33.571 --> 08:44.228
But, uh, I was, I spent, I recognized that my parents had put me here.

08:44.769 --> 08:46.031
I bought my own ring.

08:47.774 --> 08:51.259
And, uh, I bought the yearbook

08:51.847 --> 08:57.034
myself out of my money that I'd earned during the summers.

08:58.036 --> 09:00.399
Why are Aggie rings so treasured?

09:00.419 --> 09:03.823
To let everybody know you're an Aggie.

09:04.725 --> 09:08.189
Aggie born and Aggie bred and when I die I'll be an Aggie dead.

09:09.071 --> 09:10.332
Did you ever lose your ring?

09:10.673 --> 09:10.933
No.

09:11.895 --> 09:18.023
Do you have any good ring stories of being somewhere other side of the world and somebody spotted it?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.843
Oh, I'm sure that happened.

09:22.123 --> 09:25.929
I don't really recall that.

09:26.810 --> 09:40.511
But here, two years ago or a year and a half ago, I had a severe operation where they opened me up from here to here.

09:42.093 --> 09:43.175
And I've lost weight.

09:44.377 --> 09:47.942
And so I have to put— Oh, yes.

09:48.378 --> 10:02.158
Adhesive tape around to make it tight because I've lost my fingers aren't as fat as they were before that happened.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.126
Then your senior boots, where'd you get them?

10:07.566 --> 10:09.029
I got them from Hollicks.

10:09.590 --> 10:10.631
Remember what they cost?

10:12.193 --> 10:16.680
Yeah, they cost in the 20s.

10:17.453 --> 10:35.682
I've forgotten whether it was 21 or 25 or what, but the senior ring and you got to where the senior ring inverted your senior year and you got to where your boots your senior year.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.450
And do you still have those boots?

10:38.490 --> 10:39.552
You bet I do.

10:40.173 --> 10:45.461
They're in a case, you know, it's this high and that square.

10:48.045 --> 10:53.113
What were your thoughts when you first wore those boots officially, formally?

10:54.195 --> 10:58.902
I thought,

11:00.738 --> 11:05.665
Really, my thoughts were, my parents will be proud of me.

11:09.130 --> 11:24.771
We were never wealthy, and I knew it was a strain for them to send me to school, a strain to send my sister to school, who's two years older than I, and that they had sacrificed to do it.

11:24.751 --> 11:34.060
and that I hope I conducted myself so as to make them think it was all justified and that they were proud of me.

11:34.741 --> 11:40.146
And I was very devoted to both my mother and father.

11:40.386 --> 11:51.437
Did they and this special young lady come down for your first formal review at the end of your junior year?

11:51.677 --> 11:52.918
They both, yeah.

11:53.573 --> 11:55.075
And it was held on the drill field?

11:55.235 --> 11:56.216
Yes.

11:56.236 --> 11:57.317
What was the feeling?

11:58.659 --> 12:11.334
Well, no, ours was held on in that, when that presentation was made, it was right there in front of the dormitory.

12:11.354 --> 12:12.515
Oh, on military walk?

12:12.535 --> 12:12.795
Yeah.

12:13.096 --> 12:13.216
Oh.

12:15.739 --> 12:19.463
And was there a different atmosphere because of the war?

12:21.603 --> 12:37.210
There was with me, and I think pretty much with everybody, that we knew we were in what could be a deadly war.

12:37.270 --> 12:42.058
Did anybody make a special kind of speech at Final Review?

12:43.726 --> 12:45.428
No, not at final review.

12:46.590 --> 12:52.838
Then your senior year, y'all had speeded up and so you graduated in January?

12:53.018 --> 12:53.679
January.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.440
Of 40?

12:54.761 --> 12:56.463
Well, really graduated in December.

12:56.743 --> 12:57.484
December of 40?

12:57.504 --> 12:59.848
42.

12:59.888 --> 13:01.630
Two.

13:03.973 --> 13:04.934
December of 42.

13:05.135 --> 13:08.880
I was class of 43, but December of 42.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.522
Was there a final review?

13:10.542 --> 13:12.805
Uh...

13:14.573 --> 13:15.814
I'm sure there was.

13:15.975 --> 13:18.398
I don't officially remember that, but.

13:19.759 --> 13:23.203
Did parents and your girlfriend come down for commencement?

13:25.105 --> 13:25.506
Yes.

13:26.527 --> 13:29.050
And it was held in Guyon?

13:33.796 --> 13:35.778
No, ours was held in what?

13:35.918 --> 13:38.982
Yeah, Guyon Hall at the foot of the military wall.

13:39.463 --> 13:41.305
Guyon Hall, yeah.

13:41.325 --> 13:42.746
Do you remember who the speaker was?

13:43.307 --> 13:44.108
Do not.

13:44.206 --> 13:46.149
Nobody remembers their commencement speaker.

13:46.890 --> 13:49.233
And you got your diploma?

13:49.914 --> 13:51.777
Got my diploma and got my orders.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.843
Walked across stage, got your diploma, you got your orders.

13:57.124 --> 14:05.877
Walked down and... How well did you feel A&M had prepared you for the future?

14:06.683 --> 14:08.445
I thought it had done a good job.

14:08.485 --> 14:18.254
Now, what—I had made pretty good grades, and, well, they started me off—I was a school teacher.

14:18.354 --> 14:20.256
That's what I did in the Army.

14:20.996 --> 14:21.877
They taught me off.

14:21.977 --> 14:24.720
I taught at the Officer Candidate School.

14:25.921 --> 14:26.181
Where?

14:26.541 --> 14:32.727
At Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

14:34.148 --> 14:35.830
I think Lejeune was the name.

14:37.312 --> 14:39.995
But that used to be a marine base, was this?

14:40.616 --> 14:46.203
No, well Lejeune then, that's, we spent some time in Lejeune.

14:46.403 --> 14:46.683
Oh.

14:46.703 --> 14:50.027
We were at the southern end outside of Wilmington.

14:50.248 --> 14:52.090
Oh, okay.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.713
Whatever that camp.

14:58.297 --> 14:58.918
That's all right.

15:00.981 --> 15:03.724
I don't remember, but that's where I was a school teacher.

15:04.109 --> 15:07.895
All right, and you still had not, had you married by then?

15:08.136 --> 15:08.376
No.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.979
Okay.

15:10.881 --> 15:12.904
Well, I say no, that's not right.

15:13.024 --> 15:14.507
I had married by then.

15:14.527 --> 15:16.049
Okay.

15:16.851 --> 15:18.333
I married while I was there.

15:18.554 --> 15:18.914
Okay.

15:21.879 --> 15:22.741
Back to A&M.

15:23.502 --> 15:27.028
What creates this great Aggie spirit and pride?

15:29.405 --> 15:55.952
I think in my day it was the fact that we were all male, all military, and that it was a tougher school than if you went to one of these co-ed schools where you didn't have the military, you didn't have the

15:59.054 --> 16:10.498
The tightness of relationships with the guy across the hall from you.

16:11.980 --> 16:41.582
They lived in, most of the kids lived in dormitories on the campus and that didn't happen at other schools the way it did at A&M and we were closer, closer grouped people than they were from Baylor University or

16:42.338 --> 16:46.383
Was it probably true that y'all were all in the same fraternity?

16:47.064 --> 16:48.246
Yes, I think so.

16:49.928 --> 16:56.496
And Aggie born and Aggie bred Winneadabie and Aggie did.

16:57.137 --> 17:09.173
And so that yell practice and silver taps and muster and commencement and final review and all of those pulled everybody together.

17:09.254 --> 17:09.976
That's right.

17:11.038 --> 17:23.989
And as a freshman, we were required to know the name of everybody in our outfit and everybody's hometown.

17:25.285 --> 17:28.470
You did, that was required as freshmen.

17:29.772 --> 17:37.123
Well, if there was somebody you saw and you could not call them by name, we had to walk in the streets.

17:38.466 --> 17:39.748
You couldn't call them by name.

17:40.429 --> 17:45.196
You stopped Fish Bright and you had to introduce yourself.

17:45.757 --> 17:51.546
Well, of course, we only had about 38, 3900 students when I was a freshman.

17:51.526 --> 17:54.891
And I could call everybody's name on the campus.

17:56.974 --> 18:02.663
And I don't think you did that at other universities and other schools.

18:02.683 --> 18:10.294
And you knew everybody and you felt a warm and close relationship with them.

18:11.624 --> 18:17.390
Are there some people from all those years that you look back on now with particular gratitude?

18:19.032 --> 18:19.452
Yes.

18:20.994 --> 18:23.917
Well, first, I think I'll start with my professors.

18:24.017 --> 18:26.239
I think we had a good group of professors.

18:26.339 --> 18:31.024
I think I learned a lot from Mr. Vance, who was head of the department.

18:32.126 --> 18:37.591
I learned a lot from Pascal Martin, who was one of my professors.

18:38.772 --> 18:41.175
And, but I think you learn

18:42.910 --> 18:52.861
how to live and how to exist and how to do well from not only your parents but from your professors, too.

18:53.141 --> 18:57.306
And I think somehow they conveyed that.

18:57.566 --> 18:59.989
I think it was probably because of the military.

19:01.330 --> 19:08.158
And we were all military then.

19:11.767 --> 19:19.937
You gained a sense of knowing that the war came on your junior year and that you got to finish.

19:21.358 --> 19:35.395
You felt you were privileged to get to finish your education, and it was up to you to repay that privilege by making an impact

19:37.906 --> 19:49.924
While you're in the army in behalf of the country and I tried to do that and I Got to be see all my outfit and

19:52.064 --> 19:56.990
We were 1374th engineers.

19:59.092 --> 19:59.833
We were good.

20:01.895 --> 20:04.158
Our job was really putting in river crossings.

20:05.019 --> 20:15.270
We crossed the Villa River, the Seine, the Meuse, the Moselle, the Marne twice, the Rhine twice, and the

20:16.786 --> 20:22.875
There was one other little river that was a tributary to the Rhine that we crossed.

20:22.895 --> 20:31.989
They had nine river crossings, and they had the assault across those rivers and put the pipeline across it, and then they joined up.

20:32.570 --> 20:41.143
Other people were building the pipeline up to it, but they hooked onto our river crossings to get to the next place.

20:41.824 --> 20:45.409
Did you ever run into an Aggie named Earl Rudder during those war years?

20:45.507 --> 20:48.774
Not during the war years, I did after the war.

20:49.756 --> 21:00.158
As you look back on your A&M years, is there anything that A&M failed to do or didn't do as well as it should have during your time?

21:00.577 --> 21:02.359
Not to me that I see.

21:02.479 --> 21:21.859
I think it was a very good university and I think it had a leg up on a lot of other ones because of the closeness of the student body and the fact that Aggie Bruin and Aggie Brad and Winnipeg and Aggie did attitude.

21:23.381 --> 21:29.267
If you were make believe we just hired you as a consultant

21:29.365 --> 21:35.434
to A&M's leadership today to advise A&M about what it should do for the future.

21:35.975 --> 21:38.639
What advice would you give A&M's leadership today?

21:41.363 --> 21:43.225
Oh, goodness.

21:48.032 --> 21:57.246
I would start out trying to teach a person that he should conduct himself so as to be admired and respected

21:58.812 --> 22:02.517
And there are a lot of different ways to do that.

22:02.597 --> 22:24.567
It is being attentive to your duty, being honest, forthwith, being energetic, having ambition, being reliable, truthful, never attempting to

22:29.356 --> 22:36.803
Being proud of your name and not doing anything to dishonor your name or your reputation.

22:38.185 --> 22:57.844
Wherever you go to leave tracks where people would have been able to say he was a good man, did his duty, and leave footprints on the sands of time that you would not be ashamed of.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.360
and I don't know that I'm saying that well.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.201
Oh, yes you are.

23:03.363 --> 23:06.547
All right, you go away to the war and you come back and get into private business.

23:06.907 --> 23:14.338
What led you to become active in A&M events after World War II?

23:15.459 --> 23:19.725
How did you, how were you drawn back into A&M's life?

23:22.889 --> 23:26.194
Well, I guess primarily when,

23:27.237 --> 23:31.823
I was named by the governor on the Board of Regents.

23:33.164 --> 23:34.786
Did you ask for that?

23:35.047 --> 23:35.307
No.

23:36.328 --> 23:38.571
This is which governor?

23:40.594 --> 23:42.476
I believe it was Clements.

23:42.636 --> 23:43.457
Clements, okay.

23:45.560 --> 23:49.785
I didn't ask for it, but you knew I was

23:51.183 --> 23:56.652
As I said, Aggie born, Aggie bred, when I died being Aggie dead, he knew that.

23:57.533 --> 24:00.598
I was helped to Clements in his campaign.

24:00.638 --> 24:09.712
And when I got there, then they made me chairman of the board of regents.

24:09.993 --> 24:16.363
And I was flattered to do that.

24:18.757 --> 24:22.842
Who was president when you joined the board?

24:24.824 --> 24:26.987
Was this Vandiver or Bill Mobley?

24:28.368 --> 24:29.850
I think it was Vandiver.

24:30.531 --> 24:33.494
No, I guess Vandiver came on while I was chairman.

24:33.655 --> 24:36.198
Okay.

24:36.218 --> 24:39.422
Because maybe Vandiver was there.

24:39.542 --> 24:43.947
I'm fuzzy, but we thought Vandiver was a goof.

24:44.708 --> 24:46.570
There were people who did that.

24:46.651 --> 24:50.335
He called, I'm his first doctoral student at Rice.

24:51.196 --> 25:01.347
He called me the day before his appointment was announced, and he said, don't you dare say anything about this until the announcement tomorrow, but what do you think?

25:01.367 --> 25:08.955
I said, Dr. Vandiver, I can't think of anybody I have ever known who will have as much trouble understanding Texas A&M as you will.

25:09.856 --> 25:10.957
He said, why do you say that?

25:11.037 --> 25:16.523
I said, sir, you're so bright, so brilliant, you never had to go through

25:17.077 --> 25:18.879
the routine us ordinary people did.

25:18.899 --> 25:20.201
You didn't have to go to class.

25:21.203 --> 25:22.705
You didn't have to turn in anything.

25:23.466 --> 25:26.770
You got special treatment all the way through all those years.

25:27.431 --> 25:33.499
Well, he was directing the Rice Band that day and things like that.

25:34.741 --> 25:41.650
What have been your favorite, you've been so generous, what have been your favorite activities at A&M?

25:43.317 --> 25:47.727
Well, I was chairman of the board and I enjoyed that.

25:49.771 --> 25:53.219
I do not get down there for football games.

25:54.001 --> 26:02.760
I would like to, but I generally am busier taking care of my family.

26:04.192 --> 26:18.207
I enjoy meeting people from A&M and visiting with them and reliving some of the old stories, and I had a very good time at A&M.

26:18.628 --> 26:27.297
I made close friends there.

26:29.572 --> 26:51.580
I have, to me, a pride in A&M today, even though I wish it was still all male and as it was when I went, but as I told somebody when they're

26:52.606 --> 27:12.413
When they started meeting girls and so on, they say, well, not only does A&M do it, but, you know, West Point does it.

27:14.076 --> 27:20.925
It is, it's the thing that's happening in the world today.

27:22.188 --> 27:34.139
And I said I wish I had the opportunity to have girls down there when I was there.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.082
Have any of your family gone to A&M?

27:38.082 --> 27:44.588
I've got, yeah, one son down there now and three grandsons down there now.

27:44.608 --> 27:47.351
Oh good, good, good.

27:47.491 --> 27:50.794
One son that's out of, he's not down there now.

27:52.647 --> 27:57.873
You've been extremely generous to A&M.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.899
Why, what led you to be so generous?

28:04.900 --> 28:06.182
We're all grateful that you were.

28:07.103 --> 28:12.929
Well, I think A&M serves this country well.

28:14.030 --> 28:17.254
I think it is, I think it has been a

28:19.057 --> 28:40.930
benefit to this country to the benefit of the benefit of the state and I think it serves a great place in helping develop citizens for this country that will make this country continue to be a leader in the world and I think

28:42.749 --> 28:54.652
That's done it, and I've given—actually, I gave—I made one $25 million gift that's not—that I'm funding out of a development we've got north of town.

28:56.075 --> 28:57.197
And then Slocum,

28:58.392 --> 29:07.564
A couple of years ago, he called and said, I've got to have five million from you for our new building.

29:07.664 --> 29:14.753
And if I get five million from you, well, that'll make it easy for me to collect the rest of it.

29:14.773 --> 29:16.255
So I gave another five million.

29:16.295 --> 29:21.442
I've given $30 million.

29:21.562 --> 29:23.004
That to me is a lot of money.

29:23.064 --> 29:26.188
And I want to express

29:26.928 --> 29:36.685
what I think everybody feels, great, great appreciation that in that big contribution you allowed the university

29:37.205 --> 29:41.811
to use it as wherever they thought it would best serve.

29:42.352 --> 29:59.095
I have no—I think it's foolish to make a gift like that from somebody like me who is not there on a day-to-day basis, and the people that we have there know the best way to use it for the benefit of the university.

29:59.817 --> 30:03.081
Let's see, a question of evaluation.

30:03.141 --> 30:04.503
I'm not going to ask the negative now.

30:05.143 --> 30:12.933
Of the A&M leaders that you have observed, either from long ago or recent, which ones would you give the highest marks to?

30:18.179 --> 30:25.588
Shhh, shhh, shhh.

30:28.673 --> 30:56.270
Well, I think I'd have to almost, uh, categorize them in groups and in, uh, in business, uh, I think, uh, I think there are a number in business that I give high marks to.

30:57.291 --> 30:58.613
I think in, uh,

31:00.382 --> 31:13.750
the academic world uh I may think there are more in the academic world than I do than than that I know of not that they're not
