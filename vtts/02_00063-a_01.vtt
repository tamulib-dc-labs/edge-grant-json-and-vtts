Testing, four, three, two, one, four, three, two,

testing, X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z. One, two, three, one, two, 
three. This is, I believe, Monday, the 27th of

00:25.200 --> 00:32.248
August, and we're in the Evans Library, room 206. 
And today I have the pleasure of chatting with a

00:32.667 --> 00:43.642
longtime neighbor and friend, Dr. Joe Dixon, 
professor of soil and crop sciences. To begin

00:44.603 --> 00:53.375
with, to introduce you to anyone who might listen 
or read, give a biographical sketch of yourself.

00:53.396 --> 01:02.488
Where did you grow up and what did mom and dad do and 
what did you do, where did you go to high school and

00:53.396 --> 01:02.488
then college and any other experience before you 
moved here? I was born in Clinton, Kentucky, which

01:06.058 --> 01:16.889
is the county seat of Hickman County, Kentucky, on 
the very western end of the state. My mother was a

01:18.751 --> 01:27.160
schoolteacher there off and on during my early 
life. and my father, Jack Dixon, was also a teacher

01:27.815 --> 01:35.226
and an administrator. He served as principal of 
some schools in the county and eventually was

01:36.047 --> 01:54.295
superintendent of schools in the county and 
unfortunately died when I was a small child and I

01:36.047 --> 01:54.295
had his example but not his advice from day to day.

01:59.901 --> 02:17.207
And my stepfather was a farmer, so I grew up on the 
farm in Hickman County and attended the public

01:59.901 --> 02:17.207
schools there and graduated from a rural school 
called Fulgham, which is not existent today. The

02:17.227 --> 02:20.552
schools have been consolidated in Clinton, the 
county seat. From there, I went to Murray State

02:22.287 --> 02:35.081
College, it was then, Murray State University 
now, and got two years of my academic work off. And I

02:36.102 --> 02:45.713
had some vision that I might want to go on for 
graduate work someday, so I transferred to the

02:36.102 --> 02:45.713
University of Kentucky in Lexington. and 
continued my bachelor's work and completed it

02:46.300 --> 02:52.688
there in 52. And at that time, the Korean conflict 
was underway. And so I looked for a job, but I wasn't

03:00.458 --> 03:07.186
very employable. I eventually went to work with 
the Extension Service, Agricultural Extension

03:07.306 --> 03:16.037
Service, that is, in the neighboring county to my 
home county. And while I was in Fulton County, I had

03:16.810 --> 03:25.119
some good experience with agricultural 
extension, 4-H club and such. But then the

03:26.180 --> 03:42.058
military called me in and I served during the 
Korean conflict, getting my training and then

03:26.180 --> 03:42.058
eventually going to Korea and serving there and 
going back and forth to Japan a bit. And so I had some

03:42.730 --> 03:49.900
Far Eastern experience that was beneficial to the 
government and to me. And then, while I was there, I

03:52.404 --> 04:00.155
was contacted by W.A.C. Dr. C. was the professor in 
soil science, agronomy, at the University of

04:01.597 --> 04:08.147
Kentucky. and he had gone through the records of 
students that had good marks and sent us an

04:08.617 --> 04:16.207
invitation to apply for graduate study. And so I 
responded to that and that was a happy situation in

04:17.228 --> 04:33.170
that I was pleased to get started on a master's 
degree and of course the GI Bill was available and

04:17.228 --> 04:33.170
that gave me some financial support. I was 
actually married during the last term as my

04:33.750 --> 04:38.016
bachelor period and my wife Martha Jane came and 
worked at the University of Kentucky for that less

04:38.300 --> 04:49.596
than a year that I had to finish out. And then she 
returned to West Kentucky and waited there while I

04:50.858 --> 04:54.983
was in the military. So we returned then to the 
University of Kentucky and finished my

04:57.186 --> 05:07.581
bachelor's there in 56 and by then I had an offer to 
come to University of Wisconsin on a wharf, a

05:07.915 --> 05:15.145
fellowship, which was also nice to go along with 
the GI Bill. And I pursued my doctoral degree in

05:16.126 --> 05:22.735
soil science under a well-known professor, M.L. 
Jackson, in the soil science department at the

05:22.795 --> 05:26.520
University of Wisconsin. And when I completed it 
in 58, there were jobs in those days because PhDs

05:27.441 --> 05:36.353
were not all that abundant in soil science. and 
universities were expanding their graduate

05:37.177 --> 05:39.761
programs. But I wasn't too pleased with the 
offerings so I accepted a National Science

05:40.441 --> 05:59.067
Foundation fellowship and stayed at the 
University of Wisconsin for a year and did some

05:40.441 --> 05:59.067
teaching and went back and took up some courses 
that I had missed when I went through the first time

05:40.441 --> 05:59.067
because I started in a small college. and 
anticipating a job at Auburn University, which I

06:00.312 --> 06:07.359
did take then at the end of 59. And I served at Auburn 
on the faculty as assistant professor and

06:08.801 --> 06:25.898
I believe associate before I left in the growing 
program in the agronomy and soils department

06:08.801 --> 06:25.898
there. And in nine years, I was there. And during 
that period, I served as a member and then

06:30.160 --> 06:45.642
eventually the chairman of a committee, which is 
still going on today on soil mineralogy

06:30.160 --> 06:45.642
throughout the southeastern 13 states. George W. 
Coonsey was on that committee also. And when he got

06:50.124 --> 07:00.796
an offer to come up as dean of the graduate college 
at Texas A&M, he invited me to come and look at his

06:50.124 --> 07:00.796
post here. And I must say it was not exactly an easy 
decision because at Auburn I had a lot of new

07:01.757 --> 07:15.612
research equipment, a new building, and I had sort 
of come from rags to riches there. money was more

07:15.980 --> 07:21.567
available in those days for research and 
teaching. And yet I liked the potential to come to

07:21.587 --> 07:39.709
Texas A&M because it's a larger university and I 
wanted to be able to specialize, whereas at Auburn

07:21.587 --> 07:39.709
I taught geology, undergraduate soils, graduate 
soils, and soil mineralogy, my specialty. Well, I

07:40.297 --> 07:48.150
didn't feel I could reach my potential with such a 
broad selection of courses to teach. And so I came

07:49.112 --> 07:51.716
to A&M. I think I came here for about $9,000 a year. 
Now, what year was that? And that was in 1968.

08:01.934 --> 08:06.321
As far as you were aware, what reputation in the 
general area of Soil and Crop Sciences did A&M have

08:06.875 --> 08:10.440
then as an institution? Well, it was a growing 
institution. We were in a very old building, one of

08:18.611 --> 08:22.917
the very oldest ones here at A&M. At that time, they 
did have some new research equipment that had

08:23.778 --> 08:29.406
gotten a few years before. But in general it was, 
just speaking now just about the physical

08:29.825 --> 08:40.337
conditions where I came to work, they were not very 
good. But I could see a lot of potential here

08:40.957 --> 08:59.578
because at that time the bringing aboard of 
co-education was in sight and

08:40.957 --> 08:59.578
there was a distinct spirit of growth and the 
challenge that was given to me here particularly

09:00.014 --> 09:25.841
was that they wanted to build a world-class 
university and I appreciated that then and more

09:00.014 --> 09:25.841
through the years so I always considered the whole 
world my opportunity and so I started things that

09:00.014 --> 09:25.841
took me overseas occasionally and it shaped my 
whole career here. Describe the process that led

09:28.448 --> 09:32.634
to your being selected? As far as you're aware, 
were they looking at other people? Did you come

09:35.959 --> 09:37.140
visit? Did they sit with you somewhere? And was 
there an interview and so forth? Yes, I came here.

09:44.270 --> 09:53.443
As

09:44.270 --> 09:53.443
I reflect on it now, I came here by myself and looked 
at the job. And Dr. Morris Bloodworth interviewed

09:53.997 --> 10:05.099
me and showed me around, and I remember him showing 
me a soil physics laboratory and saying, isn't

09:53.997 --> 10:05.099
that typical of the mass of a soil physics 
laboratory? That's rather characteristic.

10:07.103 --> 10:09.508
They're not the tidiest of facilities, usually. 
And in general, I sort of had that impression of

10:10.470 --> 10:14.217
what I saw. but I still liked the future prospects 
and I'd say A&M was emerging in my view. Did you meet

10:22.327 --> 10:27.058
some other senior people on that trip? Yes, I met 
Curtis Godfrey who was here and Curtis was a very

10:27.443 --> 10:47.882
personable man and had a lot of experience in the 
field and I liked that very much because he was

10:27.443 --> 10:47.882
doing what had been half of my position back in 
Auburn and so I realized then I had a colleague who

10:48.217 --> 10:55.484
would tell me about things in the field that I 
wouldn't have to embrace them all. And he asked

10:56.185 --> 11:03.192
good stimulating questions that I can recall that 
was good for me as well as hopefully for him. And of

11:03.772 --> 11:10.900
course, George Kunze was still around and he was a 
gracious host. And his wife, they had me in their

11:11.380 --> 11:14.443
home and and shared some good German sausage with 
me and things like that. So I felt very much at home.

11:22.560 --> 11:30.974
Also, Grant Thomas, who was a chemist that I had 
known by reputation, he was here. And I remember

11:31.035 --> 11:35.402
visiting with him. So in general, I was quite 
pleased with the personnel. During that visit,

11:41.547 --> 11:44.531
did anything go wrong? Were there any goofs that 
anybody made or anything get confused or mixed up?

11:52.684 --> 12:01.778
I don't really have any negative reflections on 
that visit except it was a dreary time of the year

11:52.684 --> 12:01.778
and I came in here by air, and when I left, I 
remember, and it was the airplane, it was a very

12:02.247 --> 12:10.625
small airplane. Davis Airlines? Davis Airlines, 
and I remember when the pilot got in, and I got in

12:11.607 --> 12:18.502
behind him and closed the door. And in that 
situation, rainy season in that small aircraft, I

12:21.502 --> 12:32.217
felt this was some experience, shall we say. It 
wasn't all roses, by any means. When you got home,

12:35.902 --> 12:40.489
what did you tell your wife about the trip? Well, I 
think I told her that while it didn't look very

12:40.756 --> 12:48.307
glamorous, but I thought that it would be good for 
us in the long run. And then we came back together,

12:49.469 --> 13:09.278
drove over, and with our children, and did,

12:49.469 --> 13:09.278
after we had agreed to take the post, looked and 
purchased a house, as a matter of fact, while we

12:49.469 --> 13:09.278
were here. of which you know Dr. Monroe was near 
where you later built a house. It was already

13:15.561 --> 13:16.702
built? It was built, but it wasn't quite finished. 
And so we got the privilege of going through and

13:20.306 --> 13:27.594
making selections of colors if we needed to make 
any. Most of them were already made. But we did have

13:29.896 --> 13:34.261
the privilege of saying some things and approving 
others. So it was... on the extreme. Make believe

13:38.347 --> 13:42.337
that I had never been here before. Describe where 
that was in terms of the edge of town and how you got

13:42.397 --> 13:50.957
to that house at that point. How did you, what roads 
led to it? Well, as I remember, we went down Texas

13:54.145 --> 14:05.640
Avenue and then we turned on Southwest Parkway, 
but it was not a parkway much in that day. In fact,

14:05.760 --> 14:09.825
the street development was incomplete, as I 
recall it. Maybe in front of the house there was a

14:10.386 --> 14:19.738
street and that far in, but I think on out toward 
Wellborn Road it had not been completed at that

14:10.386 --> 14:19.738
time. And was there anything south of, In terms of 
streets being laid out, there was nothing south of

14:24.706 --> 14:28.152
that one. I don't think so. I think that the word I 
got was that Mr. Fitch had 400 acres that lay south

14:29.475 --> 14:38.031
and that he was going to develop that. And that's 
more or less what happened, I think. Describe then

14:41.798 --> 14:46.186
the move for you and the family. How did it go? It 
went quite well. We did things in a frugal way. We

14:52.889 --> 15:02.525
had a Volkswagen and a Chevrolet, and we tagged the 
Volkswagen on the back of the Chevrolet and drove

14:52.889 --> 15:02.525
over. And our furniture and things came by van, 
Mayflowers, I recall. And I think the only problem

15:09.256 --> 15:18.550
that came when we got here, Martha said, those hats 
of mine look like they're in bad conditions. And

15:19.411 --> 15:33.492
she reported that to the carrier and two people, 
two gentlemen came out from the local trucking

15:19.411 --> 15:33.492
firm in Bryan and they were afraid she was one of the 
men of money. for those hats. That wasn't quite the

15:36.016 --> 15:40.446
case, but they managed that all right. What was 
your, in the first months you were here, what was

15:41.448 --> 15:49.886
your impression of Texans and of people in Bryan 
and College Station? How were you received? Well,

15:52.102 --> 15:54.205
I think pretty well. I remember the first day we 
went to A&M Methodist Church, there was a short

15:54.966 --> 16:13.030
little gentleman, very frail in body, named 
Bryson. He met us in the Northex of the church and I

16:13.415 --> 16:37.397
think he had gotten wind of the fact that we were 
here to look for a job or taking a job and so he sort of

16:13.415 --> 16:37.397
picked up the ball at that point and made us feel 
very welcome in the church and then visited us and

16:13.415 --> 16:37.397
the minister visited us at home. I would say that 
that was a singular point that made us feel quite

16:37.765 --> 16:43.453
welcome here. Fred Bryson. Yeah, Fred Bryson. Was 
this in the summer that you all moved? Yes, we moved

16:49.722 --> 16:59.436
in early June, as I recall, and I think my 
appointment only started at the end of the month,

16:49.722 --> 16:59.436
or the first of July, perhaps. In other words, we 
had a period. I remember asking Morris Bloodworth

17:01.859 --> 17:08.831
when I came, well, what should I do with this time 
between now I've arrived and that? He said, well,

17:08.851 --> 17:16.043
you take a good vacation because you're going to 
need it, something to that effect. How was the heat

17:17.084 --> 17:19.348
for a newcomer? Well, we made our adjustments, but 
that wasn't exactly a rosy experience because the

17:19.902 --> 17:31.812
grass on the lawn hadn't been established and the 
heat came on. But it was a moist year, a spring

17:32.152 --> 17:42.281
anyway, so we had plenty of water at that time and we 
managed things all right. And we had help from the

17:42.341 --> 17:47.686
builder who was building a house next door when it 
came to establishing the lawn. He loans us a

17:47.726 --> 17:49.167
tractor and And across the street there was Babe 
and Art Nightingale, and they were very

17:49.720 --> 17:58.363
hospitable and helpful. and of course gave some 
professional advice on furniture and things. So

18:03.900 --> 18:07.165
we felt very much at home. The Rusynks were living 
down the street and they were obviously very

18:07.726 --> 18:17.002
friendly people and they had children about the 
age of ours. So all those things made life pleasant

18:17.703 --> 18:24.435
even though we might have had to drive over some 
dirt street to get to some places. Right, then you

18:24.989 --> 18:33.057
get to the campus, describe your office and 
research facilities. Okay, the office was on the

18:34.178 --> 18:54.777
west side of the old state chemist building, which 
I think is about the second oldest building on

18:34.178 --> 18:54.777
campus, and two large hybrid live oaks just 
outside the window. and I remember those because

18:55.583 --> 19:10.690
that shade was so important because that window 
air conditioner worked awfully hard and having

18:55.583 --> 19:10.690
some shade there made it more pleasant, 
temperature-wise and viewing-wise.

19:11.615 --> 19:30.009
Being a very old building, there was a lot of 
disorder, but Dr. Kunze had fenced off the x-ray

19:11.615 --> 19:30.009
machine lab, which had to be humidity controlled, 
and that meant that I had two cool spots. One of them

19:30.510 --> 19:34.197
was in the x-ray room and the other one was in my 
office. And in between, the temperature varied.

19:40.506 --> 19:46.955
But I was rather pleased to have some technical 
help during those days. And actually, technical

19:47.676 --> 19:51.521
help was more available then. And then I inherited 
a student from Dr. Kunze. And we collaborated

19:58.331 --> 20:01.315
some. So it was, and a lot of the other equipment 
inside the x-ray machine was quite old, and we

20:01.295 --> 20:11.710
struggled with that a bit. But new things were 
coming aboard, and some of my colleagues in soil

20:12.211 --> 20:20.323
chemistry helped by sharing some of that. So it was 
a period of growth, and that made it more

20:21.144 --> 20:30.458
attractive, even though the surroundings in that 
building were It was a bit dismal at times.

20:32.506 --> 20:40.922
Describe the department, about how big was it and 
who were the big names, who were the well-known

20:32.506 --> 20:40.922
people? Well, as I mentioned earlier, Curtis 
Godfrey was well-known for his work in soil

20:43.086 --> 20:49.678
taxonomy. And Grant Thomas had not been here so 
long, but he was a flamboyant sort of person. And he

20:58.091 --> 21:02.397
was known throughout the country, and it was nice 
to have him as a colleague. But unfortunately, he

21:02.837 --> 21:05.381
didn't last very long. He got, I think, into a 
little tight somehow and was offered a job

21:06.482 --> 21:14.934
elsewhere. And he, in fact, went to the University 
of Kentucky, which is my old alma mater. But he

21:19.882 --> 21:37.587
probably did that regrettably because I know he 
came back and collaborated for a few years, but

21:19.882 --> 21:37.587
somehow he didn't fit the social scene here like he 
wanted to, I think. But we had, I remember, a TVA

21:37.853 --> 21:55.569
representative

21:37.853 --> 21:55.569
here at that time that kept us in touch with 
Tennessee Valley Authority, which provided

21:37.853 --> 21:55.569
particular fertilizer formulations. And that 
linked the federal... fertilizer development

21:58.154 --> 22:04.784
laboratories with the university and he managed a 
program here. I know his name, although at the

22:05.585 --> 22:08.590
moment I can't call it for you. About how many 
faculty in the department then? That's always

22:12.756 --> 22:15.761
been a difficult question to answer at A&M. We had, 
now Alan Swoboda was a young faculty member and I

22:17.223 --> 22:22.090
enjoyed collaborating with him. He later became a 
builder in the local community.

22:28.613 --> 22:37.900
I always thought of the department as having about 
two dozen faculty and about half of them were soils

22:28.613 --> 22:37.900
and about half of them were crops. But now 
that's... that's generalizing quite a bit.

22:42.006 --> 22:48.892
Because, see, we have about a dozen research and 
extension centers scattered throughout the

22:42.006 --> 22:48.892
state. And those people are interactive with us 
and we with them. And therefore, usually when you

22:53.897 --> 23:02.985
look at statistics on size, we would come up with 60 
to 75 people involved. And more than half of those

23:03.005 --> 23:08.931
were located at these research and extension 
centers. And that was great for me. I'm a soil

23:11.415 --> 23:12.778
mineralogist. I like to study different kinds of 
soil and having some people working on rice down at

23:12.918 --> 23:23.697
Beaumont and reducing the environment, 
chemically speaking. And then other people

23:24.284 --> 23:34.938
working at Overton and deep sandy soils and 
deep-rooted crops and totally different soil

23:24.284 --> 23:34.938
regime. And then at Lubbock we had people working 
where water stress was greater and more on the

23:34.998 --> 23:43.149
physical problems with soils. And then of course 
El Paso. having the real desert-like conditions.

23:49.053 --> 23:55.903
So as a young scientist, that was really an asset to 
me, and I always enjoyed that. And we always got

23:56.303 --> 24:08.379
together a couple of times a year, one here in 
College Station and one at one of those remote

23:56.303 --> 24:08.379
units, and talked about our research and teaching 
and so on. And that made our professions very

24:09.120 --> 24:14.828
lively and stimulating. Compared to what you had 
known at Kentucky and Auburn, were these

24:15.297 --> 24:23.892
arrangements and opportunities similar? Did 
they have research opportunities all across

24:23.972 --> 24:31.585
their states through their experiment station 
and extension services? They did to some degree,

24:32.493 --> 24:47.515
but being smaller states, and like Kentucky is at 
about the same latitude, it doesn't vary a whole

24:32.493 --> 24:47.515
lot. in north-south direction, there wasn't as 
much diversity. And I guess being somewhat prone

24:56.189 --> 25:08.628
toward geographic movement, I just liked the 
potential of a large land area. And we had people

25:09.189 --> 25:11.072
coming in Morris Bloodworth worked down in the Rio 
Grande Valley during some of his early career. And

25:19.532 --> 25:23.338
he worked for World Bank a bit. And so we had people 
coming in occasionally from other countries like

25:23.999 --> 25:32.792
Saudi Arabia and from Great Britain connected 
with the World Bank. I remember John Coulter

25:33.293 --> 25:39.642
coming in and Mansour Aba Hussein came from Saudi 
Arabia and did a a post-doctoral here, a

25:39.875 --> 25:42.720
sabbatical here. And so eventually I had research 
contracts with the Saudis and went over there

25:43.822 --> 25:51.175
myself. So the idea that the executive part of the 
university was promoting that was a sort of a

25:51.235 --> 26:01.393
global village and that we should interact 
widely, fit it in beautifully with my plans as a

26:01.762 --> 26:15.619
soil scientist because I could learn a lot when I 
went to give a workshop in Saudi Arabia and And when

26:15.903 --> 26:22.531
I had people in from Bali, Indonesia, to talk about 
soils from volcanic materials and things like

26:15.903 --> 26:22.531
that. And those experiences made teaching much 
more exciting for both for me and for the students.

26:34.325 --> 26:41.514
Was your appointment a joint appointment with the 
experiment station and the university? Yes, it

26:41.994 --> 26:44.998
was. and that of course is true of most all the 
members of my department and Murray Milford I

26:44.978 --> 26:59.883
think was the only one in the department for many 
years that had an all teaching appointment and he

26:44.978 --> 26:59.883
had some administrative responsibilities.

27:02.527 --> 27:07.155
The

27:02.527 --> 27:07.155
opportunities that this joint appointment, I had 
a third teaching and I had two thirds research. I

27:15.860 --> 27:30.848
think one of the greatest things about my career at 
Texas A&M from a personal point of view is that I had

27:15.860 --> 27:30.848
I could teach soil mineralogy, which was my 
specialty, my research area. every year. I

27:33.182 --> 27:42.356
suspect that it's the only institution that has 
taught soil mineralogy, if not consistently,

27:33.182 --> 27:42.356
almost every year. During my 32 or 33 years of 
tenure here and Kunze's tenure before, it was

27:43.077 --> 27:50.969
taught often. I don't know exactly the frequency. 
And that, I like that. After having to skip around

27:57.398 --> 28:00.042
from Of course, semester to semester at Auburn, 
which I found very difficult to do adequately, I

28:00.950 --> 28:08.036
liked the continuity. And I brought so many things 
into my teaching from the research and made my, you

28:09.377 --> 28:30.535
know, talking about something one reads is 
usually pretty stale compared to talking about

28:09.377 --> 28:30.535
something one has observed and written up as 
research. And at least it made my work more

28:30.937 --> 28:34.180
pleasant.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.225
That evolved into several things. Just a second. 
What did you bring with you in terms of equipment

28:41.868 --> 28:46.092
and or note? What stuff did you bring to put in your 
office and in your lab? Well, when I left

28:50.356 --> 28:54.580
Wisconsin, M.L. Jackson had some old atomic 
models. And I think I had a few of those that kind of

28:57.903 --> 29:01.712
got me started. Kunze left me some here. And so I had 
built up some atomic models, which I used in

29:04.098 --> 29:15.186
introducing crystal structures of these various 
minerals that occur in soils. And I worked on x-ray

29:15.706 --> 29:27.761
equipment at Auburn, and I had the same kind of 
x-ray equipment here, so that made the transfer of

29:15.706 --> 29:27.761
skill and familiarity easy. And I had built 
thermal analysis equipment in my master's degree

29:28.802 --> 29:36.212
at Kentucky. I actually inherited thermal 
analysis equipment here, so there was quite a bit

29:37.974 --> 29:45.443
of transfer of familiarity of equipment. I think 
the thing that had a synergistic effect, because I

29:45.423 --> 30:03.454
taught often, I was under more persuasive power 
just within my own career to get some text material

29:45.423 --> 30:03.454
out. I was teaching with a book written by a 
geologist that was intended for researchers and

30:03.994 --> 30:11.447
consultants. at the University of Illinois, and 
that was very inadequate as a text, so I really was

30:11.782 --> 30:18.750
having to develop my own text material. And so I 
started about 1974 developing

30:19.271 --> 30:30.224
a book to teach with, and we finished it and 
published it in 1977. And that book was 900 pages,

30:31.085 --> 30:39.915
published through the Division Nine, the Soil and 
Mineralogy Division of the Soil Science Society

30:31.085 --> 30:39.915
of America. And I was the lead editor on that book. 
Dixon and Weed were the names on the book. And then

30:47.012 --> 30:54.482
we published that book totally revised in 1989, 
and it was 1,200 pages. So we had lots of material.

30:56.725 --> 30:58.647
The students complained a bit about it. So we 
designed another book, and it'll be published in

30:59.268 --> 31:04.255
February 2002. And it'll be a smaller book. It'll 
only be 750 pages. And that gave people in a wide

31:10.355 --> 31:18.678
geographic area some visibility of the program at 
Texas A&M. And as a consequence of that...
