00:02.191 --> 00:05.055
One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three.

00:06.537 --> 00:09.902
Thursday, June 14, testing, testing.

00:12.185 --> 00:16.050
Today we're in the Dean's Conference Room in the College of Veterinary Medicine.

00:17.432 --> 00:22.900
Have the pleasure again to record the memories of Professor J.D.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.905
McCready, particularly about the College of Veterinary Medicine.

00:28.427 --> 00:31.692
J.D., first summarize your experience.

00:32.262 --> 00:36.855
you graduated when and then what did you do between then

00:37.223 --> 00:42.891
and the time you were brought back here as a member of the professional staff and faculty.

00:43.712 --> 00:44.052
All right.

00:44.713 --> 00:50.601
I finished A&M first off in 1952, a degree in agricultural education.

00:53.445 --> 01:05.762
Then left and went to Korean conflict as a commissioned officer and mustered out in August of 54.

01:05.742 --> 01:21.945
In the interim, I had applied to the College of Veterinary Medicine, which was not so complex as it is now, but was finally accepted in College of Veterinary Medicine

01:22.195 --> 01:36.645
when I mustered out of the Air Force and began veterinary education in 1954, having completed my DVM in 1958.

01:38.148 --> 01:41.335
Upon completion, I had

01:41.315 --> 01:50.830
I thought that I was going into private practice and had a job offer in Wharton, Texas.

01:53.254 --> 02:00.045
The day I went, the week before I went to interview for that job, Dr. P.W.

02:00.066 --> 02:07.137
Burns, head of the Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, with whom I worked as a student.

02:07.117 --> 02:16.012
came to me and asked me if I would join the faculty in September of 54, of 58.

02:17.234 --> 02:24.365
And I told him, well, I had a job interview in San Antonio and one in Wharton and one in Lake Jackson.

02:25.527 --> 02:27.210
This was over Easter holidays.

02:27.270 --> 02:32.078
And so I made the rounds and

02:32.058 --> 02:35.964
was offered a job in Wharton, Texas.

02:37.266 --> 02:39.629
And Dr. Burns came to me on a Monday.

02:39.649 --> 02:43.575
I needed to let the people in Wharton know on that Monday.

02:44.296 --> 02:53.570
And that morning he asked me to please forego practice till I could help him out for at least a year.

02:54.612 --> 03:01.542
So with that admonition, and couldn't start till September as far as teaching,

03:02.180 --> 03:10.614
I went to Beaumont, Texas and went into private practice with Dr. John Coven at the Port Arthur Road Veterinary Hospital.

03:10.835 --> 03:18.728
And he'd take that road north of there and go to a place kind of in the sticks called Orange, Texas.

03:18.808 --> 03:23.817
But anyhow, I worked there with Dr. Coven.

03:24.151 --> 03:36.408
all that summer, and he offered me a position at the end of my first year at A&M to come back as a partner in the practice.

03:36.428 --> 03:43.358
And I told him that I simply had to see, but I thought that I would not want to be at A&M very long.

03:43.338 --> 04:00.300
So I came back in September with just a textbook that I bought at the store, and that's all the background I had in physiology, and tried to stay a lecture ahead of my students because we were not trained.

04:00.280 --> 04:21.715
specialties then and of course we I had a degree in education a bachelor's degree in education which was helpful and so I began teaching veterinary physiology to the veterinary students we had

04:22.387 --> 04:27.214
The only dollar question we're going to ask, what was your beginning salary?

04:27.234 --> 04:28.796
$300 a month.

04:28.816 --> 04:29.497
Twelve months?

04:29.877 --> 04:31.459
Twelve months.

04:31.520 --> 04:36.947
What were the students like then as students from your point of view as a faculty member?

04:37.047 --> 04:44.277
We had 64 students per class, where we finally had 128 now.

04:44.257 --> 04:52.389
But they, again, were highly selected students and very nice to work with and highly motivated.

04:52.429 --> 05:01.843
And the person teaching College of Veterinary Medicine really

05:02.633 --> 05:22.060
has such a fine environment as far as students that most of them would not appreciate what people have to do over on campus or in the other parts of the university with students that you anticipate losing with.

05:22.259 --> 05:30.437
Mr. Rudder told us that there would be 50 percent attrition for those that entered.

05:31.199 --> 05:37.433
In veterinary school we, normally out of class of 64, we never lost but about four or five

05:38.290 --> 06:00.030
due to grades, and one year Dr. Gibbs and I were teaching kind of, not against each other, but in his course and my course in that first year, and I lost 14 students, but that was just, they had a hard time keeping up with physiology and anatomy.

06:00.310 --> 06:03.433
Now this first year was the fall of 1958.

06:03.833 --> 06:08.297
Were, in terms of their background,

06:08.277 --> 06:12.162
Were they mostly rural or urban?

06:12.883 --> 06:18.151
Well, we had variable background in those young people in that.

06:18.872 --> 06:29.627
Of course, I wasn't much older than they were, but we had a contract with Louisiana to take about eight or nine Louisiana students.

06:30.299 --> 06:39.934
Out of the 64, we had the top eight or nine from Louisiana, and they were exceptional students.

06:40.975 --> 06:55.277
Then we had a number of former service people who had come back in to interventional medicine, and they were mature.

06:55.257 --> 07:15.932
They all, they all had good academic records before they came into the curriculum, into the veterinary curriculum, so I thought they were exceptional students, and of course the thing you appreciated was that, I appreciated was that they accepted me as a faculty member with

07:16.520 --> 07:38.435
very little expertise and elected me to head up their student AVMA program as faculty advisor and such as that, which just to be accepted was, I thought, a remarkable event.

07:39.056 --> 07:41.920
As a new faculty member, did anybody

07:42.507 --> 07:49.317
the department head, the dean, or anybody else give you any advice and guidance about what to do, not to do, how to do it?

07:50.139 --> 07:51.140
None whatsoever.

07:52.262 --> 08:07.946
In the years that I taught under Dr. Burns' tutelage, and he never, you know, the class met and nothing was ever said.

08:07.966 --> 08:08.667
There was only one

08:09.018 --> 08:20.795
time he ever said anything to me and he, as far as curriculum, he said that I needed to spend more time in covering the circulation of the horse's hoof.

08:22.197 --> 08:26.623
That's the only comment he ever made to me in the years that I worked for him.

08:27.004 --> 08:31.430
What did that, that first course or courses you were teaching, what did that cover?

08:31.851 --> 08:36.257
Well, we, it was a two semester series of courses.

08:36.946 --> 08:43.993
Our department had two semesters of physiology, two semesters of pharmacology, and a semester of toxicology in it.

08:44.954 --> 08:52.602
And I taught the physiology, and Dr. Dick Davis taught the pharmacology, and Dr. Burns taught the toxicology.

08:54.263 --> 09:02.131
I had the first semester, I had five lectures a week and two laboratories.

09:03.212 --> 09:06.936
Second semester, I had four lectures, three lectures a week,

09:07.625 --> 09:09.913
and four laboratories.

09:09.933 --> 09:13.747
I had no laboratory assistants, no technicians.

09:15.112 --> 09:17.601
We used lots of live animals.

09:19.218 --> 09:37.868
And I used lots of dogs and I would go, I'd lecture that morning, I'd go to the pound at lunch and pick up pound dogs, put them in toe sacks, put them in my truck or in my car, bring them back to the

09:37.848 --> 09:48.064
to the department, bring them upstairs myself, and have them ready for the students when they got there at two o'clock.

09:49.366 --> 10:03.147
And that was, we just did, we knew no better about having assistance or laboratory animal care or any type of

10:03.700 --> 10:07.292
lab animal instruction.

10:09.219 --> 10:13.373
We just kind of took off the streets what we could get.

10:13.994 --> 10:21.206
Describe your, in those early years, your routine for a typical work day.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.992
Got up, what time got here, did what, what time did you go home?

10:25.352 --> 10:35.108
Well, my typical routine for the first several years was to try to be in the office by 7, 7.30 and

10:35.088 --> 10:36.490
quite frequently.

10:36.711 --> 10:44.363
I stayed till 10 or midnight because I had to prepare for my labs the next day and for my lectures.

10:45.485 --> 10:50.072
And, you know, laboratory preparation was difficult because you didn't have any help.

10:50.092 --> 10:52.877
You had to get all the anesthetic agents out and all the

10:52.857 --> 11:11.894
drugs that you were going to use and all the equipment you were going to require to vent and get the laboratory notes prepared, which you did then on just any type of reproduction, a ditto machine or something.

11:13.275 --> 11:22.864
And so I never got home until at least 10 o'clock in the evening.

11:22.844 --> 11:24.766
Where'd you have lunch and supper?

11:25.367 --> 11:27.810
I ate lunch in my office.

11:27.830 --> 11:28.471
Where'd you take it?

11:28.491 --> 11:29.211
Where'd you buy it?

11:29.251 --> 11:29.492
Where?

11:30.193 --> 11:35.479
Oh, usually it was a sandwich or something that I brought from home.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.222
It was, I had one o'clock lectures.

11:38.903 --> 11:42.607
All the time I lectured it was at one o'clock in all my courses.

11:43.748 --> 11:48.514
And Dr. Ed McMurray, I never could get him to take me off one o'clock lectures.

11:48.865 --> 11:55.916
And he said, well people just enjoy physiology better than anything else if we're going to keep it at one o'clock.

11:56.878 --> 12:14.046
So I would go up down something and then go to lecture and then right after lecture I'd go down and get my labs underway and we had very

12:14.026 --> 12:18.651
minimum equipment then for physiologic recording, etc.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.197
My labs I had to make up as I went along.

12:25.398 --> 12:41.215
If we were studying blood and circulation or respiration or digestion or any of those events, I'd have to dream up a lab where they could visualize that particular system.

12:41.549 --> 12:44.353
And all of this was both large and small animal?

12:45.215 --> 12:48.079
Yes, large, small animal, all species.

12:49.882 --> 12:54.048
And describe the facilities that were available to you then.

12:54.729 --> 13:00.659
Well, we had two laboratory rooms at that time.

13:00.699 --> 13:09.312
They were equipped for dual-purpose chemistries and for recording physiologic data.

13:09.933 --> 13:18.020
At that time we were using Chimograph for physiologic recording, which was a smoke drum with a stylus.

13:20.122 --> 13:21.964
You couldn't record a whole lot.

13:23.065 --> 13:39.940
But we had a room in which the students smoked the drum and they went in and recorded data off of it and then took it back into that room and dipped it in shellac and so-called fixed it for a future reference.

13:39.920 --> 13:45.626
But our facilities at that time were, oh, they were good.

13:45.686 --> 13:46.967
I mean, this was a new building.

13:48.348 --> 13:52.893
But compared to now, they were, would have been.

13:52.913 --> 13:57.918
The vet school at that time consisted of what structures, what buildings?

13:58.558 --> 14:09.589
Well, at that time, I, we had this, the basic sciences building was opened in about 19...

14:11.493 --> 14:18.323
55 or 56.

14:19.064 --> 14:23.151
The clinics had opened first of all the buildings.

14:23.171 --> 14:33.827
So we had a small library down in the clinic that opened in 54, and the basic sciences building, I think, opened about 56.

14:34.167 --> 14:39.255
And y'all were the only instructional facilities west of the railroad?

14:39.944 --> 14:41.086
Mm-hmm.

14:41.106 --> 14:46.153
At that time, you know, there was, we had been on campus.

14:47.134 --> 14:57.990
I took my undergraduate, or my first year or so of veterinary school on the main, what we call the main campus.

14:58.190 --> 15:09.546
And, of course, with the campus growing, et cetera, and us having horses and cows and everything else, they wanted us off of the main campus, and so they moved us.

15:10.066 --> 15:12.990
across the tracks and we were the only thing out here.

15:13.150 --> 15:32.574
And of course it didn't take very many years until we were again surrounded by everything from the Bush Library to the medical school to the business college and gosh, biochem and animal science and agronomy and everything else.

15:32.594 --> 15:38.942
But we again became fairly surrounded except we

15:39.412 --> 15:52.808
I have reserved a block of land of probably a couple hundred acres that gives us a buffer system that we probably won't have to move for another few years.

15:53.308 --> 15:58.114
Now, when you joined the faculty, you were married.

15:58.975 --> 15:59.756
Yeah, I was married.

16:00.016 --> 16:03.781
And where did you all find a place to live and how much did it cost?

16:03.801 --> 16:09.047
Well, when I first came to the university,

16:09.736 --> 16:12.319
to a veterinary college.

16:12.479 --> 16:30.276
I had a GI Bill and I bought a house on Cooner Street, a small house, two-bedroom house for I think $10,000 or $12,000.

16:32.679 --> 16:38.865
The payments on the house were $26,000, $27,000 a month.

16:39.352 --> 16:43.759
including taxes and principal and insurance and the whole bit.

16:44.330 --> 16:52.677
And I lived there, and even I kept that house and lived there when I first started teaching.

16:52.717 --> 17:00.785
It wasn't until later on in about 1960 or so that we bought a little house.

17:03.907 --> 17:09.432
That was on Cooner, and we bought a house over on Marstella Street, ironically.

17:10.353 --> 17:13.476
As you became a faculty member,

17:13.456 --> 17:22.415
Were there any veterinary faculty family events where husbands and wives got together?

17:22.976 --> 17:25.461
No, no events.

17:25.542 --> 17:34.300
The only thing that was probably an activity that was

17:35.157 --> 17:38.120
had two, I'd say, two activities.

17:38.240 --> 17:48.911
One was that the faculty wives had a monthly meeting, and they were active, lots more than they are now.

17:49.071 --> 17:50.993
They're essentially not active now.

17:52.014 --> 18:04.827
And then the student chapter had the student AVMA, which brought in guest speakers about

18:05.178 --> 18:10.069
twice a month, and the faculty were expected to attend those student meetings.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.335
And those were about the only thing.

18:12.395 --> 18:19.812
We didn't have seminars or college-wide events at all.

18:20.585 --> 18:22.889
Describe the college organizationally.

18:23.250 --> 18:25.234
I guess it was the school then, wasn't it?

18:25.254 --> 18:27.378
Yeah, it was the School of Veterinary Medicine.

18:27.458 --> 18:38.239
When you joined the faculty, describe your department and who were the key members of it, and then the general veterinary faculty, who were the key people?

18:39.434 --> 18:43.658
Well, let me just start from the top down.

18:44.419 --> 19:00.757
Of course, we had a dean, and the first dean that I was familiar with was Boughton, and he's the one that told me I ought to go on to the Air Force and serve my time and then come back to the next school.

19:01.017 --> 19:03.199
That's B-O-U-G-H, T-O-N?

19:03.219 --> 19:03.379
T-O-N.

19:03.940 --> 19:08.665
And after Dr. Boughton, Ivan Boughton died, well then, Dr.

19:08.881 --> 19:20.140
Bill Armistead became dean and was dean for four or five of the years when I was a student.

19:21.098 --> 19:31.153
And then I think about my senior year or thereabouts, he left and went to Michigan State and Dr. A.A.

19:31.173 --> 19:42.330
Price from the anatomy department became dean and after 15 years he came back to the physiology department where he got his master's degree.

19:42.310 --> 19:54.600
But we had a straight line item administration, as I mentioned earlier, from the president of the university, no real vice presidents or provost or anything, to the dean of the college, to the department head.

19:55.422 --> 19:58.750
And the department heads essentially

20:01.598 --> 20:06.383
ran the university because they did faculty selection, curriculum.

20:08.284 --> 20:11.728
The whole gamut was done by the department heads.

20:11.868 --> 20:24.640
And we had the department heads function at the university as a group through the academic council.

20:24.700 --> 20:29.665
But College of Veterinary Medicine, we had a dean, and we had seven, six department heads.

20:30.758 --> 20:34.806
Of those department heads, who were the most influential?

20:34.826 --> 20:46.069
Well, the department heads that were here when I came are the ones that were really responsible for the foundation of this college or this school.

20:47.011 --> 20:50.438
You had Dr. A. A. Leonard over in the clinics.

20:51.008 --> 20:56.293
You had Dr. Beemer in the small animal clinic, Dr. Leonard in the large animal clinic.

20:57.113 --> 21:00.276
You had Dr. John Milliff who headed up anatomy.

21:00.416 --> 21:01.477
You had Dr. P.W.

21:01.517 --> 21:04.340
Burns that headed up physiology, pharmacology, toxicology.

21:05.081 --> 21:06.102
You had Dr. R.D.

21:06.162 --> 21:09.004
Turk who headed up parasitology.

21:09.865 --> 21:13.888
And you had Dr. Fred Jagge that headed up public health.

21:14.769 --> 21:18.973
And then you had...

21:18.953 --> 21:26.103
trying to figure who was the head at that time of veterinary microbiology.

21:26.603 --> 21:40.742
Dr. Hilton Smith headed up veterinary pathology and let me see I can't I don't remember the person that headed up

21:41.650 --> 21:59.285
a microbiologist, John Delaplane, died acutely of a heart attack, I think, here at the college in, oh, I don't know, probably 58 or 59 or something like that.

21:59.946 --> 22:02.511
But that group, those people

22:03.638 --> 22:15.514
are the ones that are really responsible, the foundation, the whole bit as far as the College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas University.

22:16.095 --> 22:17.557
They set the standards.

22:18.198 --> 22:33.038
They were high moral character, ethical, and very, very stern and strict in their reward system.

22:34.132 --> 22:40.941
yet they only had one objective, and that was to turn out the best veterinary practitioners they could.

22:41.001 --> 22:45.648
There was no sense of no research in the school at that time.

22:45.688 --> 22:57.484
But these people, they put down the foundation that the rest of the school and then the college was built upon.

22:58.605 --> 23:02.991
As you look back now with clear eyes of judgment,

23:03.393 --> 23:12.834
What were the strengths, and if there were any weaknesses, what were the weaknesses of the College of the School of Veterinary Medicine in the late 50s?

23:13.857 --> 23:16.643
Well,

23:17.146 --> 23:26.260
The strengths of the college were that we had this core faculty, department heads.

23:26.640 --> 23:32.890
At that time, most departments just consisted of the department head and one or maybe two other faculty.

23:34.693 --> 23:43.626
But those gentlemen did all of putting the thing together and planning and all of that.

23:43.606 --> 23:51.381
And so the strength at that time was to provide education.

23:51.401 --> 23:58.755
There was very little thought about research or publishing or anything else.

23:58.935 --> 24:02.121
The only person that did any publishing

24:02.287 --> 24:15.352
at that time of any significance, I suppose, was Dr. Hilton Smith, who wrote the text on veterinary pathology and still was used for many, many years.

24:15.793 --> 24:20.642
He was a scholarly type, but not research-oriented.

24:21.424 --> 24:23.788
So I guess our

24:26.283 --> 24:43.279
lack of research objectives and lack of funding, small staff, lack of support staff, technical staff, facilities for our animals,

24:43.259 --> 24:52.370
no air conditioning in the buildings, unpaved streets that led to the building.

24:55.333 --> 24:58.317
It was rather archaic, to say the least.

24:58.337 --> 25:01.881
Describe this man, Al Price, as much as you can.

25:02.642 --> 25:04.744
Well, Dr. Price,

25:05.315 --> 25:09.000
was a unique individual.

25:09.862 --> 25:32.976
First time I met Dr. Price, I returned from the Air Force to the Inter-Veterinary School and was told when I hadn't been back to the campus in several years, so they told me the veterinary school was located across the railroad track.

25:32.956 --> 25:45.795
So the first morning of classes, I proceeded to go across the tracks and look for my course in anatomy, veterinary anatomy, and I was told the basic sciences were still being taught on campus.

25:47.177 --> 25:52.525
So I go back to campus and find the building.

25:52.565 --> 25:54.588
There was a little building at that time.

25:54.608 --> 25:57.172
It was part of the veterinary complex called the anatomy building.

25:58.293 --> 26:00.837
And so I was supposed to have been in

26:00.817 --> 26:26.031
gross anatomy that morning, and I got there probably thirty, forty minutes late, and Dr. A. A. Price was taught gross anatomy, small animal anatomy, and there were, in this room, there were blackboards all the way around the room, and he had

26:26.011 --> 26:37.296
written nearly and filled nearly every blackboard in my absence with the characteristics of bone formation.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.813
And so there I started out way behind

26:45.856 --> 26:48.100
not even knowing where I was supposed to go to class.

26:48.160 --> 26:56.875
And then there was this articulate professor, Dr. A. A. Price, just writing and talking and going as fast as he could.

26:57.596 --> 26:59.580
We had no textbook for that.

27:00.702 --> 27:05.670
And so after that first ordeal,

27:05.650 --> 27:12.282
my thoughts were that probably I'd come to the wrong place at the wrong time.

27:12.702 --> 27:18.132
So I told my wife I'd try it a week and if I didn't like it we'd go to work.

27:19.214 --> 27:21.718
But Dr. Price was

27:23.217 --> 27:25.820
He had a good background.

27:25.901 --> 27:31.628
He had a military background.

27:31.688 --> 27:40.319
Actually, he had finished Veterinary College, was a good student, excellent teacher.

27:40.359 --> 27:46.187
And oh, in 19...

27:47.500 --> 27:50.931
58 or 59 or sometime in there.

27:50.991 --> 27:57.391
He was, when Dr. Armistead left for Michigan State, he was promoted to dean.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.160
And he was fairly young at that time.

28:00.393 --> 28:03.796
Do you remember any reaction around here to his selection?

28:04.317 --> 28:04.657
No.

28:04.958 --> 28:10.883
He was, I think he was, about that time, he was president of the Texas Veterinary Medical Association also.

28:11.744 --> 28:25.218
And so he had a good rapport with the, with the clinicians in the state and was certainly well thought of by the faculty.

28:25.338 --> 28:27.480
And, of course, he had the support of Dr.

28:27.460 --> 28:34.471
who, if you had his backing, you were in good state to begin with.

28:34.591 --> 28:46.649
But he was very, he was very stern in his teaching.

28:47.470 --> 28:50.515
He was a few

28:52.368 --> 29:09.904
If you were a quarter of a point away from a certain grade average or what have you, if you had a 91.45, you didn't get an A. At that time, 92 was an A, 84 was a B, 76 was a C.

29:09.884 --> 29:18.039
He was critical in grading, but he was fair.

29:19.341 --> 29:31.082
He, again, was teacher-oriented even after he became dean, and he realized our lack of research

29:32.648 --> 29:38.461
And that's when he hired an associate dean for research at that time.

29:38.541 --> 29:40.726
The first we had was Dr. Fred Maurer.

29:42.450 --> 29:44.835
And he also

29:46.283 --> 29:51.768
finally had an assistant to the dean part-time, which was Dr. Ed McMurray.

29:53.109 --> 30:00.956
And so again, Al was the one that had the foresight.

30:01.456 --> 30:05.439
We had a critical charge of veterinarians at that time in the United States.

30:06.140 --> 30:15.548
He had the foresight to recommend doubling our classes from 64 to 128 students.

30:16.220 --> 30:25.232
He used this as leverage to build a new basic sciences building and some more clinical facilities.

30:26.414 --> 30:40.833
And it happened at a time when the federal government started giving monies to try to stimulate increased student enrollment in veterinary medicine.

30:41.594 --> 30:45.619
And so we got, we were the only one in the United States that

30:45.903 --> 31:02.612
that Dr. Price didn't know at the time what it was going to amount to, but we know that most of the veterinary schools increased their enrollment four, five, or six students, and we doubled our 64 students, and so we got

31:02.592 --> 31:15.994
Federal dollars for those 64 students over, probably, that continued for eight, nine, ten years, which brought in a good source of revenue for the college.

31:16.014 --> 31:20.341
We were able to upgrade our laboratories and so forth.

31:20.461 --> 31:23.586
Dr. Price's nickname from the students is Slick Owl.

31:23.606 --> 31:24.347
Why?
