WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:04.297
We don't do programming.

00:04.317 --> 00:05.179
We don't know how to do this.

00:05.980 --> 00:08.524
So we need some advice from some programmers out of the MSC.

00:08.584 --> 00:18.380
We need some support and some financial assistance out of the student government.

00:18.721 --> 00:26.393
We need you, Garland, to say it's perfectly okay for the various outfits in the Corps to be a part of this.

00:26.373 --> 00:30.359
There's a big Mardi Gras, and we want the band in it.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.263
Bobby, we want Miss Texas A&M in it.

00:33.323 --> 00:37.269
We participated in the planning.

00:37.649 --> 00:46.061
In fact, I believe each one of us assigned someone to help him work through all of the issues.

00:47.163 --> 00:48.265
It was great.

00:48.345 --> 00:49.967
It was a lot of fun.

00:50.470 --> 00:56.719
We were largely along Joe Route, is where most of the crowd was, but we were pleased.

00:57.039 --> 01:08.295
And again, I lost money, but I think we would have lost a whole lot more had he not called on other folks for some help.

01:10.638 --> 01:17.187
You didn't have to cope with any natural disasters or fires?

01:18.348 --> 01:21.774
illnesses or sudden deaths or any calamities, did you?

01:22.736 --> 01:24.720
No, not that I recall.

01:26.403 --> 01:26.764
Okay.

01:26.784 --> 01:29.990
And no fiscal dilemmas?

01:30.771 --> 01:34.498
You said there was a couple of deficits, but you worked on them?

01:34.519 --> 01:36.402
Yeah, we worked on those and turned those around.

01:39.528 --> 01:41.672
What about recalling some goofs?

01:42.665 --> 01:48.513
where somebody dropped the ball or something, or where you said the wrong thing to somebody?

01:48.533 --> 01:53.160
Can you remember any, but now maybe humorous, but at the time?

01:53.300 --> 01:56.184
Well, yeah, I can share one with you.

01:56.644 --> 01:58.807
I will never forget this.

01:58.827 --> 02:09.522
It was Mr. Runyon's birthday, and so Jim, the MSC, was going to host a little birthday gathering for him at his favorite restaurant.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.625
It was called Ewals or Ewals.

02:11.605 --> 02:16.130
on Lemon Avenue, and I think it's closed now, in Dallas.

02:16.150 --> 02:25.141
And so we took, we went by University Aircraft, stopped in Waco to pick up, to pick up Doug DeClewitt.

02:25.161 --> 02:28.084
Doug DeClewitt was the other region who was in that, in the meeting on the arts.

02:28.505 --> 02:31.769
So we stopped there to pick up Doug DeClewitt.

02:31.989 --> 02:37.275
And we got to the restaurant and, let's see, it was Mr. DeClewitt,

02:38.757 --> 02:54.268
Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie, Jim and Pam and myself, and there were some other student leaders, and Mr. and Mrs. Gilchrist, Henry Gilchrist, and his wife.

02:57.539 --> 03:01.424
Mr. Runyon's daughter and her family.

03:02.084 --> 03:09.393
And so Jim said, well, Bobby, I'm going to, he actually didn't tell me, he just called on me at dinner and asked me to say a few things.

03:09.854 --> 03:25.613
And so I got up and I was talking about how important Mr. Runyon's gift is to the university because it does, art does add to the human experience, particularly, and it adds so much more on a college campus.

03:25.713 --> 03:26.854
And I said, as you all know,

03:27.442 --> 03:34.998
You know, I'm a Bryanite and Bryan College Station is just a cultural wasteland.

03:35.018 --> 03:39.527
Well, little did I know Mrs. Gilchrist, who I believe is a Harrington,

03:41.448 --> 03:52.545
came up to me afterwards and said, I was just crushed when you called Bond College Station a cultural wasteland.

03:53.065 --> 03:58.313
And, oh, she's going on and on and on about, you know, about what cultural things are here.

03:59.214 --> 04:06.325
And I said, well, yeah, I said, well, it probably was too dramatic as I described it,

04:06.305 --> 04:26.710
But what I was trying to do is to emphasize just how significant Mr. Runyon's gift is and literally what we hope to have happen and how that collection will obviously make it much easier to attract others, other kinds of gifts.

04:26.977 --> 04:40.049
and museum quality pieces, and so she recognized, she joked about it, she laughed about it afterwards, but she came up to me, and it was a group of us, and she said this, and I'm going, oh my goodness, what have I done, what have I done?

04:40.069 --> 04:46.095
And she reminded me that she was a Harrington, and so I said, oh boy, I'm in serious trouble now.

04:47.136 --> 04:56.325
In a similar fashion, do you remember during the year where either you or somebody didn't show up for something that was important, where they were supposed to be there?

05:02.971 --> 05:03.933
Not that I remember.

05:04.555 --> 05:04.655
Okay.

05:04.675 --> 05:07.422
All right.

05:08.144 --> 05:14.741
On an organizational chart, MSC reported to Vice President Colbus.

05:14.961 --> 05:15.162
Right.

05:16.104 --> 05:20.355
Describe his role for you that year.

05:21.466 --> 05:29.357
Boy, most of the student leaders would meet with him on a regular basis.

05:29.938 --> 05:34.404
I believe we got together with him monthly, if I recall.

05:35.386 --> 05:39.531
I think we ended up meeting with Eddie Joe about monthly.

05:40.913 --> 05:51.388
So we would have this time with Dr. Koldis, but he would also make himself available to us that if we wanted to visit with him one-on-one about a particular issue, we could.

05:54.136 --> 06:13.369
I always viewed him as the person that I could go to if Jim and I couldn't resolve an issue or an issue between us, we couldn't resolve ourselves, that I could always, that John Coles was always a resource for me.

06:13.389 --> 06:18.017
Not that I could go and tattle on Jim, but I could literally go to Dr. Coles and say,

06:18.689 --> 06:22.561
Can you facilitate Jim and I resolving this issue?

06:22.782 --> 06:28.058
Now, I never had to, but I got this, I always felt like

06:30.198 --> 06:48.315
for lack of a better word, he was kind of like this father figure who, he was of course always just so gracious and so calm and I just never saw him, never saw him angry, never saw him upset, just so even keeled.

06:48.997 --> 06:49.658
But I always,

06:51.376 --> 07:01.493
I always had this assurance, largely in the way he interacted with me, that I could talk to him about anything.

07:02.535 --> 07:06.482
In fact,

07:10.073 --> 07:16.463
It's like I ask him, okay, are you pretty pleased with how things are going with MSCE?

07:16.483 --> 07:28.241
And I always felt like he was honest in his response to me, that he thought we were doing well, thought we were addressing particularly the financial issues.

07:29.803 --> 07:32.728
But like I said, always felt that I could go to him.

07:33.048 --> 07:36.874
Never had to, but always felt that I could.

07:39.689 --> 07:44.874
So you graduated in five years.

07:47.117 --> 07:59.369
What were the events off campus during those five years that caused you to stop and take note of where you were and what those events might mean to you?

07:59.830 --> 08:02.953
Were there, you know, there's no World War II, there's no Pearl Harbor.

08:04.194 --> 08:09.139
Were there any events off campus that caused you to stop and say, oh, that might affect me?

08:09.760 --> 08:24.782
All the discussion about economic development and how, I should say, the state of affairs relative to the state's economy was a big issue.

08:24.762 --> 08:40.155
our lack of diversity in the economy, that we were so heavily dependent on the oil and gas, and that all the savings and loan scandals were also big issues.

08:42.278 --> 08:53.751
And so I realized, OK, my goodness, now there are going to be new economic markets coming about in the states, so there might be some additional job opportunities there.

08:56.314 --> 09:02.521
Politics began to be on, particularly state politics.

09:03.241 --> 09:08.387
I really got interested in state politics and thought, well, man,

09:08.367 --> 09:14.095
not necessarily in a public office, but around or involved in it somehow.

09:16.258 --> 09:24.931
My desire or the political bug in me was antsy to get involved in something.

09:25.171 --> 09:29.177
Did anyone ever attempt to persuade you to join there?

09:29.157 --> 09:30.118
Yes.

09:31.139 --> 09:52.144
In fact, the very first campaign, well, I got a call one day from this guy by the name of Rick Perry, who I did not know, and he said, you know, I'm State Representative Rick Perry, I'm going to be in town, meet with some student leaders, I want you to be there.

09:52.124 --> 09:56.253
I said, okay, now Rick Perry.

09:56.694 --> 10:02.727
So I go to this meeting and he says, I appreciate y'all being here.

10:03.348 --> 10:04.911
And he says, let me tell you why I asked you here.

10:05.352 --> 10:08.158
A good friend of mine is running for Congress and I need your help.

10:09.472 --> 10:13.037
And I said, well, I'm MSC president, and we don't do that political stuff.

10:13.057 --> 10:14.379
You can talk to the student body president.

10:14.399 --> 10:17.284
They're all political over there.

10:17.644 --> 10:21.169
And Rick refused to take no for an answer.

10:21.590 --> 10:22.611
He said, no, you need to do this.

10:22.631 --> 10:23.272
You need to do this.

10:23.353 --> 10:25.736
And in fact, I'm bringing him to campus.

10:25.776 --> 10:27.058
I want you all to have lunch with him.

10:28.372 --> 10:40.784
So he brought Pete Guerin to campus, and we met Pete and his wife, and wonderful lunch, and I thought, well, okay, maybe I can do this.

10:40.804 --> 10:45.409
And I had one other meeting with him and thought, okay, I'll do this.

10:45.429 --> 10:53.637
So I went over and worked on Pete's campaign, largely putting together signs and distributing them.

10:53.617 --> 10:57.724
So this is your MSC Council President year?

10:57.744 --> 10:57.885
Mm-hmm.

10:57.905 --> 11:03.975
And went out and put those signs out and, you know, I'm campaigning hard for Pete Guerin as he's running for Congress against Joe Barton.

11:06.279 --> 11:09.705
And so had a blast doing it.

11:09.725 --> 11:11.308
Of course, we didn't win.

11:11.328 --> 11:11.889
We lost.

11:13.151 --> 11:16.958
Lost the election, but got the nicest note

11:18.322 --> 11:24.347
and he came back through and said thank you, and that just left this indelible pression on me.

11:24.367 --> 11:28.163
Well, Rick, in fact, also got me to do a commercial.

11:29.695 --> 11:35.947
and that they shot with students, Pete Guerin and students.

11:36.228 --> 11:37.390
And so I was in a commercial.

11:38.573 --> 11:48.953
And so that was the very first time that I had actually been involved, and I was involved in a, it was a pretty major way for me.

11:49.085 --> 11:52.008
Did anyone attempt to tell you you shouldn't do that?

11:52.669 --> 11:52.809
No.

11:55.311 --> 11:55.692
Okay.

11:55.852 --> 12:06.442
My concern was, my real concern was how, the benefit is to play up my leadership role.

12:07.123 --> 12:10.987
My concern was how does that impact my organization?

12:11.007 --> 12:12.969
And I don't want it to negatively impact my organization.

12:14.050 --> 12:18.214
Then I didn't know, I knew we didn't get direct federal support so I knew

12:18.498 --> 12:24.126
Joe Barton wouldn't necessarily kill a federal program that was coming to the MSC because there aren't any.

12:25.108 --> 12:28.553
But I was concerned about that.

12:30.335 --> 12:41.031
But what's interesting is after that, and in fact after my tenure in the MSC was over, I got a call from Joe Barton's office.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.413
They wanted me to come by and talk to him.

12:43.355 --> 12:46.559
I went by to talk to them about going to work and taking an internship.

12:47.260 --> 12:51.244
I ended up not doing it, but I was at least pleased that they had called.

12:52.045 --> 12:57.091
My name was passed along by Dennis Gearing, who was also a member of the council.

12:57.171 --> 13:09.666
Dennis was our community member of the MSC Council, and so he knew I was job hunting and had them call me, so I thought that was nice.

13:10.321 --> 13:26.504
During those five years as an undergraduate, what were the events that you think helped to draw all A&M students together?

13:26.544 --> 13:35.417
What are the events for an undergraduate here that helped to build school spirit, Aggie feelings, however it might be described?

13:39.025 --> 13:40.266
Oh, man.

13:48.436 --> 13:59.108
We did have a big issue, and I don't know if it brought us together or if it caused us to realize how diverse we are.

14:00.110 --> 14:04.955
There was a student organization on campus called SWAMP.

14:04.975 --> 14:06.417
I don't remember what it stood for.

14:06.802 --> 14:07.824
That's the acronym.

14:08.466 --> 14:08.846
Swamp.

14:08.987 --> 14:16.363
Students, student, and they were against something.

14:16.423 --> 14:22.937
I know students, something against, and I don't remember, but this group decided

14:24.402 --> 14:29.447
that they were gonna sit and walk on the grass at the MSC.

14:32.231 --> 14:35.895
And I remember there being such controversy around that.

14:35.915 --> 14:51.051
And so while it brought together a lot of people, it also, I think, forced the campus to realize that not everybody is

14:52.178 --> 14:55.601
that we're diverse and we've got diverse interests.

14:55.621 --> 15:00.826
This group chose to do that and it was gonna be a confrontation with that group and the Corps of Cadets.

15:03.108 --> 15:09.074
And I don't quite remember what happened, how it was resolved or how it went away.

15:09.134 --> 15:10.735
I don't remember if they got on the grass.

15:11.096 --> 15:12.497
I just, I can't remember.

15:16.441 --> 15:19.924
But I don't think there was any one event

15:22.385 --> 15:27.632
But aren't there series of events that kind of pull everybody together?

15:28.673 --> 15:31.016
Well, I think athletic events always do.

15:31.777 --> 15:34.942
That's a big one.

15:35.783 --> 15:51.784
I believe what... All right, now old-timers would say silver taps, bonfire, muster,

15:53.519 --> 15:59.255
Yale practice and commencements.

16:00.860 --> 16:06.516
Well I would say commencements and I would say Yale practice.

16:08.234 --> 16:30.221
Muster and other events for, I believe, the general student body, or the general student, it's a very different experience when you're involved and you're a student leader.

16:30.241 --> 16:37.009
And while we've got a lot of student involvement on campus and lots of student organizations,

16:36.989 --> 16:53.192
The more active you are, the more, at least, it's all anecdotal, but the more active you are, the more you're likely to go to muster, do things related to your commencement.

16:53.763 --> 16:57.187
But I do think those things play an important role.

16:57.207 --> 17:00.290
But I think there's so many folks who are still left out of it.

17:00.310 --> 17:15.826
I think getting your Aggie ring is a, you know, ring day where you order or pick up your rings is just a big thing because you see people over there and you get to talk to them and spend time with them.

17:17.668 --> 17:23.314
You see, most institutions today, senior rings are passe.

17:23.767 --> 17:26.269
Outdated, old fashioned, nobody gets them.

17:26.289 --> 17:31.454
Well, you know, I've had younger cousins to go here.

17:31.474 --> 17:36.658
And for all of us, that's been a big day now.

17:36.999 --> 17:43.945
They're not as involved as they'd like to be, particularly in their A&M clubs.

17:44.966 --> 17:50.370
But they do feel fairly strongly about the school and about the rings.

17:50.391 --> 17:53.233
Now, I did not know about the ring dunking thing.

17:53.602 --> 17:56.866
And until my cousin told me about it, and she said, did you do your ring dunking?

17:57.647 --> 17:59.709
And I said, what do you mean?

17:59.729 --> 18:01.771
And I thought, well, maybe, you know, what do you do?

18:01.891 --> 18:05.676
And so she explained it to me, and I'm going, well, and she said, y'all didn't do that?

18:05.696 --> 18:07.718
And I said, I don't remember doing that.

18:09.460 --> 18:16.087
I think that's fairly recent, because I've mentioned it to some old timers, and they certainly didn't.

18:16.107 --> 18:18.350
All right, let's divert on that issue.

18:19.251 --> 18:23.035
What were the typical student...

18:23.960 --> 18:28.330
indulgences of your undergraduate years?

18:28.510 --> 18:29.693
What did students do?

18:32.178 --> 18:34.103
Tobacco, alcohol, etc.

18:34.123 --> 18:38.653
Alcohol was a big one.

18:38.673 --> 18:38.973
Where?

18:39.976 --> 18:41.479
Where did they get it and where did they drink it?

18:41.695 --> 18:45.626
Dixie Chicken.

18:46.207 --> 18:49.115
Actually, Northgate was the big deal.

18:49.135 --> 18:57.578
There was always places at Northgate where you could get alcohol and I don't remember whether we, there was this neat little

18:57.558 --> 19:00.465
There were a couple of neat little places that opened on Northgate.

19:00.505 --> 19:05.016
It seems like Northgate was expanding, and they became very, very popular places.

19:05.778 --> 19:13.216
A big hangout was La Taqueria, which is across from Cafe Excel.

19:13.537 --> 19:15.482
Cafe Excel was Rosalie's.

19:15.462 --> 19:17.224
for a while.

19:17.244 --> 19:17.945
That was a big place.

19:18.065 --> 19:24.835
Then there was a huge nightclub that was, I don't remember the name of it, but it was over on Harvey Road.

19:26.997 --> 19:30.422
I forget the name of it though.

19:30.602 --> 19:33.506
But that was a big hangout for everybody.

19:34.848 --> 19:37.892
Also, we did a lot of, students did a lot of traveling.

19:38.665 --> 19:45.276
By that I mean it was very easy for students to travel for concerts.

19:46.618 --> 19:51.045
While we didn't have a lot of the big-name concerts here, we could drive to Austin.

19:51.065 --> 19:55.192
We would drive to Austin and to Houston to concerts and make a night of it.

19:55.312 --> 19:59.700
Of course, the big thing also was to go to Sixth Street when you were in Austin.

19:59.720 --> 20:05.449
You always had to do Sixth Street, and of course, associated with that was drinking.

20:05.429 --> 20:10.859
There was also a big event that the Aggie Cowboys would do.

20:10.879 --> 20:14.445
And it was generally, they would generally bring in some great well-known band.

20:15.126 --> 20:20.316
And the big deal there was to serve hurricanes.

20:20.336 --> 20:25.665
And so we'd make sure, most certainly we'd go to that.

20:25.645 --> 20:41.761
Movies became or were very, very popular where not just, and it was movies you could, I mean renting movies, not always going to the movies, but now you could rent movies and so.

20:42.383 --> 20:43.806
And have your friends over?

20:44.309 --> 20:46.012
Yeah, and that was a big deal.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.936
Would it be at that, would there be alcohol served?

20:49.617 --> 20:52.662
Sometimes, but not always.

20:53.763 --> 21:00.513
Now, in some of these places at Northgate, people would overdo it and get drunk.

21:01.575 --> 21:13.573
And were, in those years, your undergraduate years, were those establishments competitively careful about checking the age of people making their purchases?

21:13.891 --> 21:15.795
I don't remember.

21:16.777 --> 21:20.444
Well, I don't think so, because the drinking age at that time was 18.

21:21.726 --> 21:25.694
And so most students were okay.

21:27.337 --> 21:33.148
As we read today about binge drinking,

21:34.799 --> 21:45.535
For some reason, I'd like to believe, or at least I'm remembering, we didn't binge.

21:49.058 --> 21:57.294
I think we would drink, but I thought we were fairly responsible, that we would know when to cut ourselves off.

21:58.096 --> 22:04.228
It always helped, too, I think, to go in groups.

22:04.930 --> 22:08.637
We had not caught on yet to the designated driver.

22:08.617 --> 22:13.363
But generally there was one or two individuals that kind of was responsible for the group.

22:14.704 --> 22:23.916
And so you kind of had somebody who kind of took the lead and that person usually did not have to drink as much as the others.

22:24.977 --> 22:29.182
Happy hours in town were a big deal, particularly when you could do two for one.

22:30.163 --> 22:33.848
And so students would take advantage of that.

22:35.313 --> 22:38.104
But I just, I don't think there, I just never remember.

22:38.204 --> 22:40.975
I don't remember hearing about, about binge drinking.

22:41.638 --> 22:43.686
I also,

22:44.965 --> 22:47.427
I've just been thinking about this really recently.

22:47.928 --> 22:58.498
I don't recall any of my classmates or any of my friends being alcoholics or for me to feel like they were alcoholics.

22:58.758 --> 23:06.726
I do remember now, I had a couple of friends in high school that now I know were alcoholics.

23:07.367 --> 23:10.990
And I remember them covering it up with

23:10.970 --> 23:14.394
with mouthwash or cologne and perfume.

23:15.135 --> 23:17.157
But I don't remember any of my friends in college.

23:17.437 --> 23:33.636
It was like, maybe because we were 18 and we could do it, and I'm not advocating changing the rules again, but sometimes when it's there for you,

23:34.595 --> 23:39.240
It's kind of like working in a fast food restaurant.

23:40.762 --> 23:45.208
You just get to the point where, I don't want to eat french fries anymore.

23:45.228 --> 23:47.170
I don't want another hamburger.

23:47.210 --> 23:48.111
I want something else.

23:48.852 --> 23:51.094
And by and large, this was consumption of beer?

23:52.256 --> 23:52.476
Yes.

23:53.457 --> 23:54.859
By and large, consumption of beer.

23:55.820 --> 23:56.481
All right.

23:56.501 --> 23:57.302
Smoking.

23:57.322 --> 24:00.906
What were they smoking, your contemporaries?

24:02.270 --> 24:19.054
Cigarettes, some cigars, but there were people that I knew that smoked pot, but not very many.

24:19.815 --> 24:29.509
And again, my best guess was they would do it

24:31.177 --> 24:34.544
It was not like they would do it in a large crowd.

24:34.624 --> 24:40.014
They would start out somewhere drinking.

24:40.295 --> 24:41.517
They'd say, go to happy hour.

24:41.978 --> 24:45.986
They're not on their way from happy hour, excuse me, to a club.

24:47.188 --> 24:48.230
They'd smoke it in the car.

24:48.911 --> 24:50.434
And obviously you could smell it.

24:51.216 --> 24:53.320
But that...

24:53.300 --> 24:55.563
I don't remember that being a regular thing.

24:57.686 --> 25:02.353
It was sort of being sort of kind of cool to smoke.

25:02.513 --> 25:14.069
But what I also found interesting, we did one of the SCONA programs, and I was amazed at the number of students that came to SCONA that smoked.

25:14.791 --> 25:19.938
And I remember all the other student leaders talking about, what is this deal with everybody smoking?

25:19.958 --> 25:22.902
Because it was, I mean, it's a big thing.

25:22.882 --> 25:29.756
And actually we had a lot of students that came from the Middle East for that SCONA conference.

25:29.776 --> 25:30.658
So I was amazed by that.

25:33.003 --> 25:34.967
Let's see.

25:35.588 --> 25:55.133
whiskey and other stronger alcohol was that legal could you buy it by the bottle it was legal you could buy you could buy it fairly easily and i was trying to remember even at parties did we try scan punch was kind of

25:56.530 --> 26:00.539
It was kind of a big deal in high school, of course, but it wasn't such a big deal here.

26:01.020 --> 26:04.728
Like I said, the big deal at the Aggie Cowboy deal was hurricanes.

26:06.612 --> 26:13.206
But you could buy hard liquor and do mixed drinks.

26:15.262 --> 26:20.512
I mean, some people did, but by far, beer was much more cheaper.

26:21.655 --> 26:32.897
The imported beers were just starting to be popular, and so I think a lot of people were drinking.

26:33.738 --> 26:36.544
We always liked to try the imported beers.

26:38.836 --> 26:43.981
Let's see, and you don't even know what Whiskey Bridge meant, do you?

26:44.001 --> 26:44.061
No.

26:44.081 --> 26:58.416
See, when this was a dry county for hard liquor for whiskey, you drove Highway 60 towards Snook, and just after you crossed the Brazos River, there was a little country store on the north side.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.840
The site has just been cleared by the four-lane road.

27:01.860 --> 27:04.843
And so you went over there and legally could buy...

27:05.363 --> 27:11.229
a pint, and bring it back, and so that was called Whiskey Bridge.

27:11.249 --> 27:17.896
I don't know how many students actually bought alcohol except if they were having parties, and big things were obviously kegs.

27:19.718 --> 27:30.710
But it seemed that most folks who, rather than just buy it, we would buy drinks and not actually buy the liquor.

27:30.730 --> 27:35.235
But that's just, again, the people I'm most familiar with.

27:35.637 --> 27:40.163
All right, look back on these five years now from the point of view of diversity.

27:42.447 --> 27:51.940
Did it matter to you and your colleagues much as you realize it now about someone's ancestry or their sex?

27:52.120 --> 27:56.987
Were women and men and black and white and Hispanic and so forth?

28:00.612 --> 28:10.797
It mattered to my African-American friends, but did not matter to my Anglo friends.

28:10.817 --> 28:12.681
And I say that

28:14.922 --> 28:33.150
It was literally, it was a big issue for those of us, for African American students, not all, but a lot of the African American students, it was a big deal and we wanted to do all we could and we wanted the university to do all it could and we thought the university wasn't doing enough.

28:33.130 --> 28:39.442
But we were wanting to help in any way we could.

28:41.486 --> 28:46.576
For my Anglo friends, it was a non-issue.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.686
I didn't have... Does that mean they were biased?

28:52.267 --> 28:55.493
No, I got the impression that it was...

28:57.802 --> 29:02.207
It was like, well, they were indifferent to it.

29:02.287 --> 29:10.897
It wouldn't have mattered to them whether there were more African Americans on campus or not.

29:11.478 --> 29:13.540
Not that they would have been disappointed at all.

29:13.560 --> 29:19.827
It was just like, okay, no problem, no big deal.

29:23.722 --> 29:30.508
There was not a great deal of discussion about race and race relations on campus.

29:32.024 --> 29:33.586
at least for me.

29:33.907 --> 29:39.415
There were some, but there wasn't a national focus on it.

29:40.777 --> 29:53.897
I think it was generally accepted that it was a good thing for the student body and for the faculty to be more diverse.

29:53.877 --> 30:01.648
But I never met any Anglo student that was resistant to it.

30:01.868 --> 30:04.371
I mean, that didn't think that was a good idea.

30:05.072 --> 30:11.781
Can you share any incidents that you have to tolerate from anybody that at the time were inappropriate?

30:13.664 --> 30:14.605
You know, I really can't.

30:18.110 --> 30:22.416
Nobody called you by any name or threw some insult at you?

30:22.885 --> 30:24.127
Not that I remember.

30:24.167 --> 30:39.586
There was one incident when Mr. Runyon and I were at dinner at another time, and he was talking to me about, he was telling me about somebody who worked for him.

30:40.127 --> 30:42.990
And he was telling a story, he was trying to tell me how great this guy was.

30:44.252 --> 30:52.302
And he used the term, he said negro.

30:54.239 --> 30:55.301
I knew Mr. Runyon.

30:57.183 --> 31:06.376
And so what he was, he was not trying to, he was not, he did not, I kept it in the context.

31:06.396 --> 31:14.828
I'm smiling because in the Deep South, 30 years ago when I was doing research, I heard that pronunciation quite often by people who thought they were being polite.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.093
That's exactly, that's exactly it.

31:18.113 --> 31:18.814
That's exactly it.

31:18.834 --> 31:22.339
And he's going on and on about how wonderful this guy is.

31:22.977 --> 31:26.196
And you put two and two together and you go, well, no, he's not.

31:26.316 --> 31:29.595
I mean, he just, the term.
