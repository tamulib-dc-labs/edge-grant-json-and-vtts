WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:09.729
I have a lot of respect for a lot of the Civil 
Liberties Union positions and the people that

00:03.237 --> 00:09.729
work with it. Of course some of their positions I 
don't agree with at all. I'm not concerned about

00:15.219 --> 00:17.904
the rights of Ku Klux Klan people. I'm not 
concerned about the rights of Nazi Party people.

00:22.733 --> 00:26.781
I'm not concerned about the rights of John Birch 
people.

00:32.397 --> 00:41.068
But as a whole, I think the ACLU is a very good 
institution with a lot of good work. I think a legal

00:41.088 --> 00:47.717
education really helps a person examine the 
relationships between things. If you're not

00:47.737 --> 00:59.772
careful, you go to college and you get channeled 
into too narrow a focus, and you don't begin to

00:47.737 --> 00:59.772
understand the connections between economics, 
history, government, law, literature,

00:47.737 --> 00:59.772
engineering, business, In fact, our society too 
much wants us to become so-called experts. But

01:07.675 --> 01:16.067
then as you go along, I just read a business section 
paper the other day, they want more lawyers now

01:07.675 --> 01:16.067
because they're generalists, what they call 
generalists. They do understand more of the

01:16.487 --> 01:21.815
interconnections between various problems.

01:25.821 --> 01:30.147
It really taught me a lot, my legal education. law 
professors, not that they taught me that much law,

01:30.464 --> 01:42.236
but they sure taught me a lot about how to analyze 
things and how to

01:30.464 --> 01:42.236
develop a good shit detector. I mean, you find out 
there's always 42 sides to a story if somebody's

01:42.376 --> 01:52.587
glib enough and articulate enough and you can come 
up with some crazy theory that will support

01:42.376 --> 01:52.587
anything.

01:56.731 --> 01:57.592
What else we got? Here we go.

02:01.480 --> 02:08.929
What was the concept of the split rail?

02:14.897 --> 02:20.764
Maybe I just better wrap out as briefly as I can what 
the rail was, how it occurred, and what it was

02:14.897 --> 02:20.764
about. And out of that, you might get the answer to 
that. Because it never was written down, or it

02:24.229 --> 02:29.395
never, unfortunately, never was well enough 
conceived and understood for it to hold together.

02:34.657 --> 02:38.744
So it was different things to different people, I 
guess is what I'm trying to say. The Split Rail Inn

02:39.946 --> 02:48.280
was a very famous and well-liked honky-tonk here 
in town. It was started after the Second World War.

02:51.466 --> 02:55.112
It so happens by a second cousin of mine who I didn't 
know until years later, was gay. And he started

02:58.571 --> 03:01.135
that bar and did a good job of decorating it. It was a 
drive-in restaurant. They sold hamburgers,

03:03.218 --> 03:06.062
fish, and all. He was in the military area during 
the Second World War, and they put up bamboo. They

03:10.328 --> 03:12.551
had a bamboo garden area. And then they used 
parachutes from the Second World War that they

03:12.611 --> 03:19.140
draped over a frame, where finally they put picnic 
tables. And people would come here and drink beer,

03:19.160 --> 03:22.905
and a lot of veterans. He started that place. He 
also started another place that was well known

03:25.269 --> 03:30.734
here in Austin for years, the New Orleans. And then 
several years after that, he killed himself. I

03:33.838 --> 03:37.582
don't think he ever worked out his sexuality and 
relationship with society. Too bad he didn't live

03:38.743 --> 03:41.546
to now. A lot of those problems are being worked out 
or much better addressed. But the Split Rail Inn

03:48.316 --> 03:51.981
started out as a drive-in restaurant beer joint. 
During the 60s, it more or less got converted to a

03:52.001 --> 03:56.368
music place. Threadgill, the old man, used to have 
a little gas station out there. We'd yodel like

04:03.037 --> 04:05.221
Jimmy Rogers. You all familiar with Jimmy Rogers, 
who he is or was? He was singing breakman blues, a

04:08.686 --> 04:10.608
lot of yodeling. Threadgill sings like that, did. 
Threadgill started singing out at the Split Rail

04:15.315 --> 04:17.158
Inn. It became very popular. He'd play once a week. 
And they started having other groups. The guy that

04:24.418 --> 04:36.177
was a bar owner of them was a typical American small 
business man, very greedy, and let's get it on,

04:24.418 --> 04:36.177
bring your money, and I'll get you drunk, and you be 
quite nice, and I won't hurt you. And then he... But

04:40.342 --> 04:42.564
it had kind of a loose atmosphere. And socially, it 
played a pretty significant role during the late

04:42.584 --> 04:50.232
60s and early 70s when I was talking about that 
clash between hippies and rednecks. And there was

04:50.252 --> 04:54.997
a wide variety of people that came to the split 
rail. And there was lots of tension there between

04:55.017 --> 04:57.900
the long hairs and the rednecks. But that got 
worked out. And without too many fistfights or

04:59.261 --> 05:05.647
physical brutalities, lots of verbal abuse. But a 
lot of that got worked out. And those people became

05:07.509 --> 05:10.332
friends. began to do things together politically 
and socially and sexually. And that was the kind of

05:15.753 --> 05:16.914
place it was. It was very open-minded. And you'd 
find state senators there and lobbyists, and

05:18.916 --> 05:30.489
you'd find YNOs, and bikers, and hippies, and goat 
ropers, and Marxists, and the whole schmear. I

05:30.509 --> 05:34.012
mean, it was a very good place. And it changed 
ownership several times. And each time it became

05:39.708 --> 05:44.395
more focused as a music place. A lot of good 
musicians played there when they first came to

05:45.457 --> 05:50.204
Austin. The Bonds, I don't know if you know Stevie 
Bonds, those guys played there back when they were

05:50.224 --> 05:55.511
first starting out. Of course, didn't vibrate. 
Marshall Ball, who used to be Freda and the Fire

05:57.034 --> 06:01.020
Dogs, she used to play there. And I could go on and 
on. A bunch of groups used to. When they first came

06:04.084 --> 06:07.369
to Austin, that's one of the places they played. 
And

06:07.872 --> 06:13.221
of course, I'd been going there for years. As I 
said, I used to drink heavily. I wasn't active

06:15.444 --> 06:22.996
politically or with friends or lovers, and I was 
usually drinking at a bar, listening to music. And

06:24.519 --> 06:33.593
at one point in my life,

06:24.519 --> 06:33.593
for about nine years, I lived with and loved a woman 
named Bobbi Nelson, who's a very fine person, a

06:35.108 --> 06:48.305
lawyer, an activist, a revolutionary, and a heavy 
feminist organizer. We're no longer together. In

06:49.066 --> 06:50.948
fact, she's married now to another man. But Bobbi 
and I were living together. We had a big house out in

06:53.211 --> 06:56.736
the university area. And we had a number of people 
that lived with us. And they were all highly

06:58.278 --> 07:02.263
active, highly articulate, tense people. At one 
point, I was without a job. She wanted to quit

07:04.802 --> 07:08.708
practicing law, did quit practicing law finally 
after we got the split rail. I went to work at the

07:09.609 --> 07:10.991
split rail. I lost my job as a painter. I painted 
apartments for a couple of years. And I was out of a

07:15.437 --> 07:20.184
job, and I went out to see the guy who owned it. He 
used to be one

07:20.204 --> 07:28.335
of the top dogs in state bureaucracy over here, and 
he got fed up. said to hell with it and went and

07:29.007 --> 07:32.171
bought the split rail. At any rate, he gave me a job. 
I went to work there. Jim Parrish was his name, and

07:35.055 --> 07:37.678
he's from a wealthy family. I didn't know that at 
the time, but he's from a wealthy family down in

07:38.019 --> 07:40.782
Corpus. Bobby knew that because Bobby originally 
came from Corpus and went to high school with

07:40.803 --> 07:45.789
Parrish.

07:48.913 --> 07:49.534
Time passed. He decided to close the rail down. 
We...

07:58.167 --> 08:12.505
We'd been talking for a number of years that we 
wanted to have a restaurant, a bar, a music place, a

07:58.167 --> 08:12.505
counterculture place where you could have art and 
media and people getting together and talking

07:58.167 --> 08:12.505
about their lives and what they wanted to do and 
what they didn't like and so forth. And we never

08:13.326 --> 08:14.428
could find one. Of course, you always got the 
problem of money in this society, and it's a

08:14.448 --> 08:22.438
heavy-duty problem unless you want to sell your 
soul and screw a lot of folks. At any rate, finally,

08:23.820 --> 08:28.005
he closed it down and We had a group of three or four. 
I don't want to go into all this detail. It would

08:34.799 --> 08:39.725
take too long and it's very painful. There were 
three or four of us that had met for several weeks,

08:39.745 --> 08:51.819
probably six or seven weeks, talking about the 
concepts of the place and how it ought to be run. We

08:52.360 --> 08:53.702
didn't have the split rail at that time. We were 
talking generally. There were three women. from

08:58.158 --> 09:03.684
the university area activists. I can't even 
remember how to block their names. It's a hell of a

09:06.388 --> 09:09.651
thing to say. Because we ended up in a fight out 
there, and they ended up contrary to my position

09:09.671 --> 09:14.777
and Bobby's position. But they were very fine 
activists. They had a lot of respect for them. The

09:20.964 --> 09:24.148
split rail, we kept talking to Jim Parrish, the 
owner, you know, we'd like to buy it or it's

09:25.883 --> 09:28.306
possible for us to open it up. He didn't want to 
reopen it. He was having some problems with the

09:29.428 --> 09:31.991
alcoholic beverage commission. And

09:32.031 --> 09:51.638
eventually, he decided that,

09:32.031 --> 09:51.638
and he was leasing it from me, a person who owned the 
basic lease from the landowner, if you follow me on

09:32.031 --> 09:51.638
all this. Eventually, Parrish said, y'all take 
the place. He gave it to us, which was a hell of a

09:54.664 --> 09:58.028
thing to do. It was worth probably on the normal 
business market, $25,000, $30,000. It had eight

10:04.375 --> 10:05.756
years to go on the lease. Part of the building was 
over 100 years old. There used to be a stage

10:09.180 --> 10:11.143
crossing down there. Of course, it got burned 
down. Eventually, the bikers burned us down. But

10:16.508 --> 10:27.824
he let us have the lease, and he said, and we were 
good friends by then, and of course he knew Bobby,

10:16.508 --> 10:27.824
but Jim and I were good friends, and he said, you 
know, if y'all make it three or four years from now,

10:16.508 --> 10:27.824
you can give me $5,000 or $10,000. I said, okay, 
we'll do that. But we had to enter into the lease

10:30.708 --> 10:43.687
agreement with the person who had the basic lease 
and follow all the regulations of the lease, and we

10:30.708 --> 10:43.687
had to borrow money, and most of that was done on 
Bobby's credit. I didn't have any credit by this

10:43.827 --> 10:45.790
time, and I have credit now. I lost all my credit 
cards and credit in 1964, about eight credit cards

10:46.124 --> 11:00.382
and about $25,000 down the tubes when I dropped out 
of the Liberal Democrat business. So Bobby is the

11:02.244 --> 11:04.066
one who came up with most of the credit. We had this 
group of people who wanted to do this thing. Of

11:06.710 --> 11:10.194
course, we knew this was different than starting a 
new place. This is a place with a lot of history, a

11:10.214 --> 11:13.498
lot of tradition.

11:15.014 --> 11:20.459
has been there and is well known in serving a 
certain function. We put together a group of

11:20.499 --> 11:45.004
people and we did it very quickly which in my view 
later turned out to have serious problems with it

11:20.499 --> 11:45.004
because people got into it with different ideas 
about what it was about and what was permitted and

11:20.499 --> 11:45.004
not permitted and who makes decisions and all that 
but it was run on the idea was that everybody

11:20.499 --> 11:45.004
participate that works there and that everybody 
makes the same and all decisions be made by general

11:45.693 --> 11:51.919
discussion and general decision, a new left 
concept. In other words, it wasn't to be done by

11:51.979 --> 11:56.804
following parliamentary procedures and strict 
votes. Of course, there are conflicts

11:57.645 --> 12:06.674
between trying to run any kind of an operation like 
that and trying to do a day-to-day business. I

12:06.714 --> 12:07.795
mean, there's natural tensions. There's certain 
things that have to be done. These are the things

12:09.838 --> 12:14.282
that eventually we've got to work out as far as our 
society goes, I think. So

12:15.747 --> 12:20.412
I guess I was kind of a manager. We had three or four 
or five of us, I forget how many, that all had access

12:21.633 --> 12:31.402
to the checkbook, signed checks, that kind of 
thing. But if questions came up and needed a

12:31.422 --> 12:44.455
decision immediately, I made the decision, if 
there hadn't been already some policy or

12:31.422 --> 12:44.455
statement made concerning that thing. We tried 
to, and we did for a long time, do a pretty fair job as

12:45.582 --> 13:00.583
far as the menus, the type of food, good 
vegetables, not canned stuff, not bad product,

12:45.582 --> 13:00.583
but well done.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.630
We broadened the music variety. Eventually, that 
was one of the tension spots about how much country

13:07.253 --> 13:15.184
music, how much of this, how much of that.

13:17.915 --> 13:19.236
Which bands do you have? How do you handle fights or 
potential fights? How do you handle a lot of

13:24.761 --> 13:31.607
sexist, macho cursing activity? We had pretty 
good policy about that. I mean, none of that was, as

13:35.031 --> 13:46.521
far as our policy goes, was tolerating men fuck up, 
they're supposed to leave, which is one of the

13:35.031 --> 13:46.521
reasons it eventually got us crosswise with some 
of the backers who have down the road burned us down

13:48.307 --> 13:51.731
after we had barred them from coming there.

13:57.717 --> 14:10.290
So, I mean, the concept of the split rail was that it 
was to be owned

13:57.717 --> 14:10.290
and operated by that group of people who put it 
together. After the big argument came down

14:10.310 --> 14:17.638
between me, to a large extent, with Bobby, but me to 
a large extent on one hand, and a good many of the

14:17.939 --> 14:30.561
staff who had worked at the Sprint Rail before were 
not from the university activist area. And some of

14:33.086 --> 14:34.328
the activists, that was the group that kind of 
identified with where Bobby and I were coming

14:35.405 --> 14:38.188
from. We did not want too many changes too quick as 
far as the type of music, type of menu. Soybeans,

14:45.496 --> 14:47.419
fuck that. You know, all kinds of what you might 
think of as silly arguments about what food's

14:47.439 --> 14:54.066
gonna be served and what isn't. And then on the 
other hand, I guess 60% of the people on the staff

14:54.827 --> 15:01.935
who came more or less from the university. And a lot 
of it was about how much responsibility you had to

15:06.940 --> 15:12.587
that activity. I mean, that was a big conflict with 
me, because there were several of the people who

15:13.488 --> 15:24.140
wanted to have a major voice in how the split rail 
was run, but they did not spend that much time on

15:13.488 --> 15:24.140
staff out there. They also had other jobs or other 
things going as far as student life goes. And we had

15:29.766 --> 15:32.209
problems about that. Big problems.

15:37.964 --> 15:42.288
All of that got intensified to the point where we 
had a major break. They threw us out. Bobby and I

15:45.472 --> 15:52.879
went off and spent a couple days thinking about 
what are we gonna do or what should we do and how do we

15:45.472 --> 15:52.879
do it? And we finally decided that we had to take it 
back over. We were legally responsible. and

16:02.362 --> 16:09.252
financially responsible as far as the debts. And 
all of it, what was going on was a learning process,

16:09.272 --> 16:12.618
too, by the way. I mean, we didn't know, a lot of us 
didn't know shit from China about how you handle

16:12.638 --> 16:18.246
all the different taxing agencies and how you keep 
these records. A lot of dispute going on about

16:19.588 --> 16:23.053
whether we were making a profit. We weren't close 
to making a profit because we, you've got to, if you

16:23.093 --> 16:30.765
know much about business, you're the business 
one, you know, Most businesses have regular

16:31.167 --> 16:40.918
accounts that you systematically pay into so that 
when the time comes, you've got to pay the tax man or

16:31.167 --> 16:40.918
pay this so that you've got the money there. And 
that ain't no profit. That's a liability, I think,

16:42.520 --> 16:46.084
as far as bookkeeping goes. But it ain't money to be 
spent. Don't mess with it. But we had those kind of

16:49.288 --> 16:50.569
arguments. And we figured that, plus we figured, 
well, we thought that it would go down

16:52.492 --> 16:59.740
financially. and that it would also go down as far 
as its role in the community. Most of the people

17:08.441 --> 17:14.909
that came to Split Rail identified with where we 
were coming from as far as what they wanted as far as

17:08.441 --> 17:14.909
music and venue. Most of the other group, the 
predominant group in our structure, were for more

17:17.412 --> 17:24.921
changes, more changes rapidly. All of us were for 
changes. All of us wanted a chance to form Abbott.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.688
It's a question of how fast. There we go. We had a 
major fight. We got the police to finally throw

17:34.218 --> 17:39.623
them out. The alternative to that was to throw them 
out physically, which we could have done because,

17:40.444 --> 18:00.726
as I say, most of the split rail clientele 
identified where we were coming from, most of the

17:40.444 --> 18:00.726
working people, the bikers and the laborers and a 
little bit of everyone. We didn't want to do it. We

18:02.843 --> 18:03.544
weren't willing to do it. It would have been bloody 
because they didn't like where a lot of them were

18:03.744 --> 18:08.930
coming from. We had a number of gay people on staff. 
It could have been real shitty. So we decided to use

18:14.017 --> 18:26.452
police and did, which we were severely instilled 
to this day or severely criticized for using to

18:14.017 --> 18:26.452
oust them because we were the legal proprietors. 
And then picket lines after that, and it went on and

18:28.154 --> 18:31.438
on. Sadly, very sadly, it caused a major split in 
the Austin left at that time. Of course, the Austin

18:37.298 --> 18:45.406
left was already having severe problems with 
sectarianism and sexism and a lot of other things.

18:45.426 --> 18:53.153
But a lot of friendships were split up and 
heavy-duty criticism back and forth, some of

18:45.426 --> 18:53.153
which still exist today. And that was, I don't 
know, seven, eight, nine years ago. Oh, and it

18:58.538 --> 19:00.480
makes me very sad.

19:03.683 --> 19:07.948
And I don't think either side was right or wrong in 
any absolute sense. It was like all tough

19:07.968 --> 19:09.530
problems. It was a mixed kettle of fish. You want to 
go on, or? Yeah, I'm fine. If I'm not boring you out

19:15.377 --> 19:18.640
or not running out of time. What were the goals? 
Communes? And were you a member? And why the whole

19:23.526 --> 19:26.810
concept of communism? You discussed that earlier 
a little bit.

19:33.017 --> 19:33.117
Yeah. In addition to the split rail, I don't know 
what you're talking about as far as what is a

19:33.788 --> 19:41.796
commune. Okay, define commune. Yeah, the split 
rail was a community. I mean, we established a

19:46.361 --> 19:54.590
community there that was going, a group that was 
going to identify and operate the split rail. So in

19:54.610 --> 19:56.832
one sense, that was kind of a commune thing. The 
only other two things I was involved with that I

19:57.433 --> 20:01.517
remember right now One of them was Satva. Don't ask 
me to spell that. I think it's a Jewish word or a

20:07.157 --> 20:09.700
Middle Eastern word. It was the first vegetarian 
restaurant, I guess, in Austin, which we did at the

20:10.441 --> 20:19.593
University of Methodist Church, and it was done by 
a group of activists.

20:21.816 --> 20:24.600
I got into it after it was already functioning. The 
University of Methodist Church had a student

20:24.620 --> 20:32.770
union, and they had kitchen facilities, big 
dining room facilities, and you could seat 200 or

20:24.620 --> 20:32.770
300 people. cafeteria-type line, and they set up 
this communal restaurant operation. At one

20:42.645 --> 20:44.487
point, I went and worked there. It was the first 
time I'd worked at a restaurant in 20 years,

20:44.507 --> 20:52.495
although I did back in law school a long time ago. 
They, there, we, I don't know,

20:52.515 --> 21:03.106
I guess there must have been 15 or 20 of us that were 
on staff, and I guess two-thirds of them were

20:52.515 --> 21:03.106
women. And And I guess there were probably six or 
eight key activists, you know, what traditions

21:05.133 --> 21:13.265
would call leaders. But I didn't think of it that 
way, and they didn't either, because the one thing

21:14.387 --> 21:24.842
the New Left really got clear on is you've got to be 
very careful about when you start bestowing the

21:14.387 --> 21:24.842
leadership label on somebody. You're going to 
screw some people up in a hurry if you're not

21:25.884 --> 21:28.568
careful. At any rate, there were six or eight key 
people, and probably two-thirds of them were

21:28.588 --> 21:34.396
winning. And I thought it ran real well. The jobs 
were rotated. In other words, you didn't get

21:39.787 --> 21:41.730
stuck. Two days a week, you might be the 
dishwasher. One day a week, you might be the chief

21:44.113 --> 21:47.157
cook. All the jobs were rotated, except they did a 
good job, I thought, of keeping tight control on

21:48.019 --> 21:58.113
that bank account. They had two or three people 
that took care of the money and the buying. regular

22:03.757 --> 22:31.975
meetings to discuss anything anybody want to 
discuss whether it was what's going on in the big

22:03.757 --> 22:31.975
society how can we relate to it we want to have 
programs here which we did occasionally we had

22:03.757 --> 22:31.975
speakers demonstrations started out of that 
place we have to organize the bus drivers union

22:03.757 --> 22:31.975
here originally the bus drive a bus was hijacked 
one time and the people that did that that work

22:03.757 --> 22:31.975
hijacked i mean they took over a bus and took it away 
and it among other things helped pressure the bus

22:32.630 --> 22:39.499
company into recognizing the union. There were 
some people who were part of that group that

22:39.519 --> 22:45.466
organized that little effort and it worked well. 
We had art things, movies, theater, plus every day

22:47.689 --> 22:54.638
we fed everybody. And people didn't go away 
hungry. I mean, you came to town and it broke. You

23:01.053 --> 23:03.176
could always get beans and rice. I didn't like the 
cooking because I'm not a vegetarian. Most of that

23:06.462 --> 23:08.224
stuff is very bland. You've got to work like crazy 
to get it very spicy. They did a good job, and it

23:11.469 --> 23:14.554
lasted for a good while. In fact, it did so well, and 
I guess I wasn't close enough to the people to

23:15.155 --> 23:21.705
understand all the dynamics of this, Maybe it was 
because of the tension inside the women's

23:22.327 --> 23:31.156
movement at the time, but then some of the women 
decided if what they really wanted to do was open up

23:22.327 --> 23:31.156
another place. This was called Delta Diner, and it 
started off as an all-women's group, four or five.

23:40.445 --> 23:44.869
And then I think they finally had a couple of men 
that worked there. And they were some of the most

23:44.889 --> 23:48.773
talented men Two of the women, I think, used to be on 
the Austin newspaper. They were writers,

23:53.485 --> 23:58.531
some singers, dancers. They had some great songs. 
They did some wild theater over there. They had a

24:06.642 --> 24:16.836
place even more in the student neighborhood, and 
there were a lot more students

24:06.642 --> 24:16.836
that we didn't reach at the other place. But there 
was a good fraternal relationship between the

24:17.744 --> 24:21.709
Delta Banner and Sotlo. So that's another 
operating commune operation I was part of. But as

24:25.694 --> 24:34.506
far as what most people, or good many people think 
of as a commune is when you live together, sleep

24:25.694 --> 24:34.506
together in the same house. For several years, we 
had a house on 31st and a half street off of

24:35.968 --> 24:44.119
Waterloo, right out north of the university. 
Owned by Bobby Nelson. and owned in the sense of

24:47.528 --> 24:52.033
most people in the capital society. In other 
words, she had mortgage payments, made payments

24:52.053 --> 24:57.578
every month, didn't own very much equity. But 
she'd had enough credit after she got out of law

24:57.598 --> 25:04.385
school, as most young lawyers do, where you could 
buy something and say you'd pay it off. So she was on

25:04.806 --> 25:06.688
the house. And she and I were lovers and friends and 
political comrades. And...

25:17.296 --> 25:28.676
And it was a, at the time we started, it was a 
three-bedroom house, had a great big living room,

25:17.296 --> 25:28.676
dining room, big high ceilings, a fairly large 
kitchen, and had a garage out back. There were two

25:29.658 --> 25:32.503
other people that lived there. That grew, and then 
Bobby's daughter, who had been maybe with her

25:34.222 --> 25:43.253
mother out here a little time, called Lockhart, a 
very small girl at that time, she came in. Bobby and

25:44.134 --> 25:46.016
I agreed, and she came back and lived with us. There 
was Bobby and I and Karen, the little girl, and then

25:46.737 --> 25:55.888
Diana and Alice Embry, and then it grew, and grew 
very much. Diana had a daughter, Chrissy. They

25:58.811 --> 25:59.932
lived in the front room. You know Ronnie Duggar, 
who started the Texas Observer? Well, at any rate,

26:04.023 --> 26:06.626
Ronnie's got a son called Gary Duggar. Gary and 
Diana used to be friends and lovers. Gary lived

26:08.789 --> 26:09.931
there for a while. And then there were a couple, 
John Muir and Diana, I mean, Alice Embry, who lived

26:11.392 --> 26:18.822
in the back bedroom. It grew, and we were all very 
active politically in the events that were going

26:19.543 --> 26:26.672
on. always something wrong. At a big dinner table 
that I made out of a sheet of pie, we had four by

26:28.982 --> 26:32.586
eight. We could seat 12 to 20 people at that table. 
And there were several of us that were good cooks.

26:38.694 --> 26:41.838
And we had lots of organizational meetings and fun 
times there. There again, we rotated jobs as far as

26:43.601 --> 26:46.905
basic responsibility. We didn't cook every 
night, but it was all worked out by the common

26:46.925 --> 26:51.551
consensus. Naturally, it never does work 
perfectly, and the men are going to fuck up more

26:51.912 --> 26:56.878
than the women, and usually. But a lot of things got 
worked out and it was a pretty good situation. The

27:03.100 --> 27:03.760
house grew. We opened up the attic finally and put 
in a bedroom and a bath up there and we opened up the

27:03.780 --> 27:21.899
garage, put in an apartment by our bedroom with a 
loft in the garage and we had some more people. I

27:23.601 --> 27:25.583
think at one time we had about ten 10 people, all 
activists, all political, none sectarian, none

27:26.423 --> 27:35.792
liberal Democrats, but all either radicals or 
revolutionaries. They're highly active.

27:40.417 --> 27:41.018
Learned a lot. A lot of that household on the split 
rail issue, it split, which is one of the things

27:43.380 --> 27:55.232
that makes me sad because Alice Emory and John 
Muir, two people that I dearly love, ended up with

27:56.022 --> 28:02.389
contrary views to mine and Bob's about what should 
be done on the split ramp. Some of that's been

28:02.410 --> 28:05.133
healed over, but not very much. But we did, you 
know, we

28:06.935 --> 28:13.723
worked hard at being open and honest. I mean, 
anybody could call a meeting. Anybody could

28:15.185 --> 28:19.009
speak up.

28:22.229 --> 28:25.073
If somebody was talking too much like I am, then 
somebody else would. You shook a little shit

28:26.655 --> 28:30.922
tonight. Any particular questions?

28:38.713 --> 28:39.574
Strong points. Really to help increase the 
pressure on them.

28:47.120 --> 28:52.966
Decision makers to stop the war in Southeast Asia 
were the May Day demonstrations in the early

28:47.120 --> 28:52.966
1970s. I don't know whether y'all are familiar 
with them or not, but there were massive

28:52.986 --> 29:07.802
demonstrations in Washington, D.C. And there 
were more people arrested during that period of

28:52.986 --> 29:07.802
time than ever before in the history of the United 
States. I think about 14,000 people arrested in a

29:07.962 --> 29:11.946
three-day period. We had a sizable group from 
Austin that went to that. We did a lot of intensive

29:15.940 --> 29:19.144
work before we went. And it was called the 
Armadillo Mayday Tribe. And a lot of that grew out

29:22.448 --> 29:28.617
of that Sotva Delta Diner community. People had 
got to know each other and the split rail. A bunch of

29:31.721 --> 29:33.804
the folks had got to meet each other there. And we 
had our own literature. We had our own logos,

29:36.788 --> 29:41.815
shirts, t-shirts, all of that. We were well 
organized. After we got there, it turned out we

29:43.545 --> 29:51.633
were one of the three or four best organized groups 
on the scene from out of town. And, of course, it was

29:52.434 --> 30:00.441
a heavy-duty demonstration, lots of brutality by 
the police, swinging sticks. About that long,

30:00.461 --> 30:02.143
they were like axe handles. They weren't like 
night sticks. About like a baseball bat, not quite

30:05.266 --> 30:09.810
as big around as a baseball bat, but they didn't 
give. And the fuckers were riding around in these

30:09.890 --> 30:12.072
motorsports. bikes or on a horse, reach over and 
knock the shit out of you and those things. And you

30:19.767 --> 30:23.617
had to be organized to take care of yourself and 
your friends. And we were organized in what we

30:23.897 --> 30:26.604
thought was a very good way. We had what we called 
affinity groups.

30:31.373 --> 30:37.964
Each group, nationally, assignments were made 
after we got up there, consensus agreement.

30:37.984 --> 30:48.180
Assignments were made, each group would have a 
certain target, like you're going to be at

30:37.984 --> 30:48.180
Washington Square, or you're going to take this 
bridge, or you're going to be part of the group that

30:37.984 --> 30:48.180
does this, as far as the geographic area. And then 
when it comes to the tactics, it generally fell

30:48.500 --> 30:52.006
into two categories. Those groups of people who 
are like the Quakers, who are nonviolent

30:52.046 --> 30:58.917
pacifists, are not going to Some of them are going 
to break the law, but they're going to do it in a

30:59.369 --> 31:04.857
certain way, like just sit down and not move and get 
busted. But they're not going to turn over a car or

31:04.897 --> 31:14.110
shut down an intersection or close down a bridge. 
They're not going to. And then there are groups of

31:15.272 --> 31:18.417
folks who are going to do a variety of things. And 
the only limits we had were that thou shalt not kill

31:18.477 --> 31:28.431
or maim, in other words, draw the line, it 
physically hurt him. Although we recognize that

31:32.004 --> 31:37.593
as far as self-defense goes, that's another ball 
of wax. You get the shit beat out of you, you do

31:37.613 --> 31:42.341
whatever you need to do to change that. If you're 
not a fool, in my view, I'm not going to stand to get

31:43.243 --> 31:53.440
beat if I can help you. Inside the group that went 
from Austin, we had those two same strains. So we

31:58.019 --> 32:22.043
had it worked out where certain areas within our 
big area were and targets were assigned to the

31:58.019 --> 32:22.043
group that was going to act a certain way and then 
the ones that were going to do the other things that

31:58.019 --> 32:22.043
might be more risky legally and physically or in 
the other areas where they wouldn't as much as

31:58.019 --> 32:22.043
possible cause pain to the ones who didn't believe 
that was. And what we did, and it worked out well,

32:25.165 --> 32:30.613
because you had to worry about undercover agents. 
I mean, they did have a lot of informers and some

32:30.633 --> 32:36.480
provocateurs. There's a woman here locally that 
now we know, we didn't know at the time, was a police

32:36.821 --> 32:44.411
agent, a provocateur. And she was part of that 
progressive labor group I was talking about, that

32:44.812 --> 32:49.378
sectarian malice. She's a cop. She's a... She's 
the second in command of Westinghouse Security

32:52.263 --> 32:56.289
out here. We go to some of the same music concerts. 
At any rate, to combat all of that, well, you worry

32:59.774 --> 33:08.748
about the agents, and we had to have what we call 
affinity groups. Three, four, five people would

33:08.768 --> 33:11.713
get together that knew each other. And you have 
what the convictions were and their background,

33:13.175 --> 33:21.207
and it cuts down heavily on the possibilities 
you're going to be infiltrating. And we had a

33:22.402 --> 33:24.825
number of people, affinity groups. That worked 
well. We had a number of people arrested.

33:31.013 --> 33:35.559
It was a three-day activity up there and different 
targets each day. I was arrested on the third day. I

33:39.745 --> 33:43.950
went up ahead of, I was talking about advance work. 
I went to Mayday, Washington, two weeks in advance

33:44.190 --> 33:50.839
to help do some of the advance work as far as... 
targets and logistics and all of that shit. And I

33:55.777 --> 34:08.912
also had the responsibility after we got there to, 
after the demonstration, to try to locate people

33:55.777 --> 34:08.912
and see who was in the hospital, who was avoiding 
the cops, who was busting, trying to get lawyers,

33:55.777 --> 34:08.912
all those things. So it was my responsibility not 
to get busted the first two days, but did

34:18.781 --> 34:24.511
participate and was arrested on the third day in 
the steps of the House of Representatives. And

34:25.893 --> 34:31.603
that night, and what's funny, I get a big kick out of 
it. That night, they put us in different stadiums

34:31.623 --> 34:36.531
and sports arenas. And they had me, along with 
several thousand others, in this basketball, I

34:36.691 --> 34:45.025
don't even know what it is, basketball arena. And 
they wouldn't let us down on the floor, and it was

34:45.815 --> 34:50.541
very crowded up where we were, and we were trying to 
get down there so we could sleep at night. Finally,

34:51.262 --> 34:54.866
some of us jumped the rail and had a confrontation. 
I got hit with one of those trucking clubs about

34:54.886 --> 34:57.649
like that. I didn't hurt. I thought I'd broken my 
arm. They sent me to the doctor. At any rate, I

35:01.254 --> 35:06.400
stayed in jail there for 36 hours.

35:10.245 --> 35:15.231
Got out, and we finished up that demonstration, 
came back to Austin. And if you follow a legal

35:17.202 --> 35:27.635
redress, after that, major lawsuits were filed by 
the left and by the National Mobilization, by the

35:17.202 --> 35:27.635
ACLU, on our behalf. Different people, different 
categories, depending on when they were arrested

35:27.856 --> 35:32.822
and how. Ten years later, or no, I guess it was about 
ten years, eight or ten years later, I got $2,000

35:32.842 --> 35:42.013
because we won. Nixon, and who was that, Haldeman, 
those assholes, Some of the guys on the Supreme

35:47.729 --> 35:49.992
Court. Anyway, we won that lawsuit, and that 
$2,000 was what we used, Bobby and I, as part of the

35:51.473 --> 36:02.526
money to start up Emma Jo's, which was our last 
club, which is named after Joe Hill and Emma

35:51.473 --> 36:02.526
Goldman. If you know your history, then you know 
Joe Hill was a poet and a songwriter and a union

36:02.546 --> 36:12.758
organizer, a wobbly, and Emma Goldman was a 
revolutionary intellectual and a great woman.

36:13.295 --> 36:14.336
two of our favorite people. And so $2,000 of 
Nixon's fucking money went into starting the Emma

36:14.356 --> 36:20.145
Jones. But that was a major demonstration. Then we 
came back home,

36:22.207 --> 36:34.284
and it was during that period of time when they were 
getting ready to dedicate the LBJ library, and

36:22.207 --> 36:34.284
fucking Nixon was coming down here. So we got 
organized, and we had major demonstrations. Of

36:40.774 --> 36:42.576
course, they, and they had, the Rockefellers and 
the Rothschilds and the whole entourage of big,

36:43.788 --> 36:55.040
rich shits who were murdering people. They had 
ropes to keep us half a mile away if they could, and

36:55.060 --> 37:05.731
we had major plans and efforts made to try to put 
pressure on them. And again, allow people to do

37:05.871 --> 37:12.478
what they wanted to do and were willing to do, those 
people who wanted to get arrested or that. What's

37:13.353 --> 37:21.263
kind of interesting on a personal level was the day 
before that, of course, we were open in all of our

37:13.353 --> 37:21.263
activities. You could come to our meetings. The 
cops came. The head of the Red Squad was Bert

37:24.047 --> 37:29.053
Gerding, who is the chief officer out at Weston 
House. But he was the head of the Red Squad, the one

37:29.433 --> 37:33.018
who was charging political activities. He'd come 
to our meetings. The media would. So they knew

37:36.202 --> 37:38.805
generally what was planned. Of course, they 
couldn't break into those affinity groups who

37:41.669 --> 38:11.389
would make their own little decisions about what 
they were going to do the day before the massive

37:41.669 --> 38:11.389
demonstration when Nixon was going to be here and 
Lady Bird and all of them would sit up there and

37:41.669 --> 38:11.389
shoot the shit at each other

37:41.669 --> 38:11.389
we had our last pre-planning meeting over in East 
Woods Park which is very close to the LBJ library

37:41.669 --> 38:11.389
beautiful place very dense woods and we got over 
there and there's the goddamn Texas Rangers so if

37:41.669 --> 38:11.389
we'd run into them before some other 
demonstration but usually they're They were

38:11.639 --> 38:18.889
there just for the DPS, and sometimes the soldiers 
just try to intimidate you. Of course, that's what

38:18.909 --> 38:21.892
they were doing that day, too. But that day, what 
they were doing, they were serving papers. And me

38:25.557 --> 38:35.250
and, I think, seven or eight others all got served 
by the Rangers with papers trying to enjoin us.

38:35.888 --> 38:36.969
from doing anything illegal. Well, if you know 
your law, you're not supposed to do anything

38:36.989 --> 38:41.995
illegal anyway, and so really the injunction's 
full of shit. Except it makes it easier for them to

38:43.356 --> 38:57.732
throw you in jail if they don't like something 
you're doing, and then they can argue later about

38:43.356 --> 38:57.732
it on a different basis than if they didn't have the 
injunction. But mainly it was to intimidate,

38:57.752 --> 39:02.858
which if you were young and didn't know the law and 
and didn't know the Texas Rangers and what their

39:03.344 --> 39:08.272
history is, which I assume you do. I mean, they've 
been used primarily by men of property that put

39:08.292 --> 39:22.895
down the Indians and the Chicanos, and then were 
used very brutally in labor and Chicano

39:08.292 --> 39:22.895
relations. So we had that confrontation with the 
Rangers there, but it...

39:33.905 --> 39:35.067
That all worked out. And that demonstration, I 
thought, was successful in the sense that there

39:35.087 --> 39:41.295
were thousands of people involved. It was a major 
occasion where all these hot dogs. See, by that

39:44.239 --> 39:51.689
time in American history, most of those folks 
could not even go out in public up close to the

39:44.239 --> 39:51.689
public. They were all on the farm. I mean, your 
fucking president, secretary of state, defense,

39:53.471 --> 39:56.535
fuck you. But they wouldn't dare get close to the 
people. They were always away from them. which in a

40:02.137 --> 40:06.864
so-called democracy is a strange set of peaches. 
And all of that was shown on television again. And

40:09.627 --> 40:18.880
that does a good job because it shows people around 
the world that they are the American people trying

40:09.627 --> 40:18.880
to pressure these people into doing the right 
thing. And that helps to build up long-term

40:20.242 --> 40:24.829
benefits. Hopefully it helps to prevent nuclear 
wars because it shows Russian people, American

40:25.670 --> 40:31.418
people, that they're different levels. Russian 
leaders and American leaders are one level, and

40:34.483 --> 40:48.284
American people and Russian people are another 
level, and all the basic interests are the same,

40:34.483 --> 40:48.284
except when you get to those leadership levels, 
and then it changes.

40:51.189 --> 40:52.791
Okay, we're gonna talk about the media. Okay. 
Describe the press coverage of the movement in

40:53.532 --> 40:58.180
both the establishment press and the underground 
press. Okay. I think the first thing to remember

41:01.233 --> 41:06.641
about the American media, because here you're 
always going to hear about freedom of speech,

41:01.233 --> 41:06.641
press, all that bullshit. Like we don't have a 
democracy. We really don't have freedom of

41:10.166 --> 41:11.528
speech. I don't think. Because you've got to have 
means and access. Excuse

41:17.797 --> 41:24.888
me. It doesn't do me any good to go out there and make 
a speech right now. Nobody's going to hear me. If

41:31.034 --> 41:41.308
you're going to have an impact and try to get your 
views across, then you've got to do it with some

41:31.034 --> 41:41.308
type of media, either the print media or 
television is a big thing now. Okay, who owns the

41:42.430 --> 41:43.531
press? Who owns the television networks? Who owns 
the radio stations? If you look into the ownership

41:47.256 --> 41:55.487
and control of those institutions, then you know 
what their social and economic, moral, religious

41:47.256 --> 41:55.487
values are. And what you'll find is... They're all 
just what you think. They're all very

42:00.228 --> 42:07.617
conservative capitalists, like the idea that 
they can accumulate all the property they want,

42:00.228 --> 42:07.617
and if poor people starve, fuck it. That's tough, 
but that's life. Or they may not like it, but they

42:11.522 --> 42:14.485
say, well, there's nothing we can do about it. 
We've just got to tolerate part of the price you

42:15.126 --> 42:19.492
pay, which I don't believe. I think there's enough 
resources and technology where we can feed and

42:19.592 --> 42:25.459
clothe people around the world if we decide to do 
it. But the media is owned by corporate

42:25.810 --> 42:29.435
capitalists. And they decide who the editors are, 
who goes on the newscast. By the way, your TV

42:33.821 --> 42:39.449
newscasters, those people are not profound. They 
are not reporters. They are actors and actresses.

42:44.236 --> 42:45.238
They're bullshitters. They're folks that smile 
pretty and string words together. But as far as

42:49.664 --> 42:53.910
really understanding and having the experience 
and access to a whole lot of information and having

42:54.869 --> 43:23.121
done their homework 98 of them are actors and 
actresses we used to have edward r murrow was an

42:54.869 --> 43:23.121
exception during the second world war that guy 
knew a lot of people knew a lot of things in other

42:54.869 --> 43:23.121
ways that were going on he was a news person but most 
of what we get on tv the newscasters are bullshits

42:54.869 --> 43:23.121
you get involved you'll find out that's true and 
most of them they take from the establishment

43:23.978 --> 43:44.873
institutions the governors the senators major 
corporations they take their pr handouts which if

43:23.978 --> 43:44.873
you get into advertising or you know you type up to 
try to get a certain attain a certain goal i mean you

43:23.978 --> 43:44.873
want to tell a story and get people to buy your goods 
then you write up new products PR list and give it to

43:45.106 --> 43:47.489
a TV station. A lot of them, they'll say it's news, 
you know, that I got a new wizard for $48 a pair. Same

43:54.638 --> 43:58.162
way with what governors and senators and 
presidents. And they let those people get by with

43:58.182 --> 44:02.507
murder ordinarily. You will not see now, or I 
haven't in years, reporters confronting the

44:02.527 --> 44:07.854
president. That doesn't happen anymore. It did 
happen when there was great pressure on in the

44:09.075 --> 44:11.758
1960s. And some of them made life hell. for Johnson 
and Nixon, but the people who own those networks

44:14.333 --> 44:29.708
don't permit their reporters to ask those 
embarrassing questions, and when Reagan

44:14.333 --> 44:29.708
bullshits, to say, quit bullshitting. I asked 
this question one, and you answered question 10. I

44:32.912 --> 44:33.752
ain't interested in 10. What about one? They won't 
let you pin the sumbitch down.

44:40.179 --> 44:41.320
So they all play the game. Of the major networks, I 
think the lineup is probably the same. The ABC

44:46.898 --> 44:48.700
network is the farthest right. As far as part of the 
ruling class, their views projected across who

44:49.221 --> 44:58.411
they interview and how they interview and how they 
handle news stories is the most right wing. It's

44:58.451 --> 45:03.778
more in line with the Jesse Helms, Goldwater, 
Reagan right. CBS and NBC. Of course, CBS is pale in

45:08.266 --> 45:10.489
them, I think. They're more like the 
Rockefeller-Kennedy establishment, Democrat

45:11.129 --> 45:24.525
establishment, Republican, the mainstream 
liberal capitalists, the ones that ABC is further

45:11.129 --> 45:24.525
to the right. The newspapers, most of them, and of 
course you know that the TVs and the radios and the

45:26.787 --> 45:33.675
newspapers are all becoming more centralized. 
They're owned by fewer and fewer people. And that

45:35.737 --> 45:38.020
is a very dangerous thing. Very critical thing, 
and it could be, I guess, I don't know. I haven't

45:41.956 --> 45:43.258
really analyzed it. This Australian son of a 
bitch, whatever his name was. Murdoch. Murdoch?

45:47.605 --> 45:48.146
Yeah. You've got to watch that motherfucker. And 
Ted Turner. You've got to watch that guy, too.

45:53.494 --> 45:57.741
Because he's very fundamentalist, 
conservative-oriented. And so as far as human

45:58.902 --> 46:07.095
beings go, food and clothing, those are not big 
issues with those folks. And they are big power

46:08.510 --> 46:10.432
people. They are not even part of that liberal CBS, 
I mean, NBC act. They're to the right of ABC. You've

46:18.700 --> 46:19.861
got to watch out for them. Washington Post is an 
establishment Democrat, the woman who owns that.

46:25.887 --> 46:33.274
New York Times is the ultimate liberal, 
Republican liberal Democrat establishment.

46:33.374 --> 46:37.538
That's Kennedy, Rockefeller, Harvard, Yale. 
menu bunch. Old, big wealth. Their views are

46:42.872 --> 46:44.034
represented there. The underground. Of course, 
what we found was that all the stuff that people are

46:46.479 --> 46:52.029
interested in, these bastards ain't going to tell 
you about it. They ain't going to write about it.

46:53.232 --> 46:54.234
They ain't going to put it on the air. You just 
screwed dude. So that's where the underground

46:56.879 --> 47:00.606
media came from. And it happened all, it's 
spontaneous. It seemed like it just happened

47:03.962 --> 47:07.628
here, it happened there, all about the same time. 
I'm not enough of an expert to know the exact

47:07.928 --> 47:16.180
sequence as far as when the barb started and when 
the rag started, all the different ones. The rag

47:16.580 --> 47:19.645
had a big impact here in Austin, I know that. It had a 
very dedicated group of people. Again, very open.

47:24.071 --> 47:26.154
Of course, I'm talking in generality. It would 
always be acceptable. That's what I'm saying.

47:29.699 --> 47:30.981
Some of them were highly manipulative.
