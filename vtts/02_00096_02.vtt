WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:04.890
Yes, there were.

00:07.795 --> 00:08.516
There were drownouts. We'd take people into the 
quadrangle, and we'd get as much water as we could,

00:08.596 --> 00:20.714
and we'd dump water and mud on them. Do you remember 
what it was like going to your first football

00:22.877 --> 00:26.323
games? I sure do. Describe that.

00:32.532 --> 00:52.274
When you're a poor boy from the radar like me and you 
go to a field like Kyle Field and you sit with the

00:32.532 --> 00:52.274
entire Corps of Cadets and you cheer on a team that 
wasn't producing a very good record in 1965, it's

00:32.532 --> 00:52.274
still exciting to go to the game and to see that many 
people. I mean, there were as many people in that

00:55.432 --> 01:02.523
football stadium, as it were, the entire city of 
Laredo, and that was sort of an amazing statistic

00:55.432 --> 01:02.523
for me. And your yell practice in those days, was it 
in the stadium? No, the yell practice in those days

01:09.253 --> 01:13.740
was in the stadium. And was it already at midnight? 
See, earlier they'd had them at... We used to have

01:18.989 --> 01:22.433
them, it was not at midnight, it was like at 11 
o'clock at night. Okay, but it was 11. But we still

01:23.955 --> 01:30.122
called it midnight yell practice, but by the time 
it was over, it would be close to midnight. And what

01:31.023 --> 01:36.410
would a fish wear to midnight yell practice? Did 
you wear a uniform?

01:40.455 --> 01:42.817
Haskell, I don't remember whether we wore 
uniforms. Did you all ever do any pranks? No, we

01:44.740 --> 01:45.280
would. We would wear... We would wear our uniform 
pants, make sure our belt buckle was polished, and

01:47.997 --> 01:58.352
we'd polish our shoes, and we'd wear a t-shirt to 
midnight yell practice. But we, one, I used to hate

01:58.412 --> 02:03.720
midnight yell practice because it would 
completely destroy your shoes. And it was, to me,

02:04.521 --> 02:12.793
it was a form of hazing because the shoes that you 
wanted to always keep, we'd wear boots to midnight

02:04.521 --> 02:12.793
yell practice. And you had to go to class the next 
day. We'd have to go to class. No, normally we'd go

02:18.240 --> 02:20.422
to midnight yell practice on a Friday. And so on 
Saturday, if you went to class on Saturday, you had

02:21.384 --> 02:32.418
to polish those shoes or boots again because they 
would get completely destroyed and scuffled up

02:21.384 --> 02:32.418
because of the parading that went on before 
midnight yell practice. And anything that you

02:33.639 --> 02:39.827
learned early about what a fish is supposed to do at 
the game? Of course, we learned that all. during

02:44.613 --> 02:58.647
the, what I would say, educational sessions that 
we'd have every day before every meal or every

02:44.613 --> 02:58.647
evening before we went to shower after we had study 
period. We'd have the upperclassmen, in essence.

03:03.632 --> 03:09.699
As a beginning freshman, how did you communicate 
back with your family about what was happening and

03:03.632 --> 03:09.699
how you were doing? Through letters, which are 
still in A briefcase that I have in my attic right

03:11.748 --> 03:13.690
now. Oh, all right. Then let me preach you a plea, a 
sermon. If you ever, ever, ever are willing to part

03:17.695 --> 03:24.484
with those, send them to the A&M Archives so 
they'll be there forever. You ought to make Xerox

03:25.365 --> 03:34.296
copies for your children so that... All the 
letters that I wrote to my parents when I was in

03:25.365 --> 03:34.296
Vietnam are Oh, those too. Yes, yes. And about how 
often did you write to your parents your freshman

03:38.935 --> 03:42.259
year? I'd say about every week to two weeks. And did 
you get letters back? Yes, but not as long as mine

03:48.867 --> 03:50.689
were. If we were to summarize what your first 
letters said, what do you think that... I think the

03:56.075 --> 03:59.459
summary would be, life is not easy here. It

03:59.519 --> 04:02.983
is not... It is not always fun.

04:10.126 --> 04:12.630
I love my freshman class. I love my peers. They're 
my brothers. We're all having a hard time, and keep

04:16.276 --> 04:20.742
us in your prayers. They were not mournful. They 
were not sorrowful letters, but they were letters

04:23.646 --> 04:30.777
that indicated that things were not as... easy as 
they as I thought they might have been. Did you ever

04:34.180 --> 04:35.863
think about dropping out? Oh of course, but I 
never. Why didn't you? Tried and I knew that I could

04:39.790 --> 04:41.574
make it. I knew that I could make it. When you got 
when you got your first grades, how were those your

04:43.177 --> 04:48.767
freshman year? At that point we were on a 
three-point grade point average and I had a a 2.5,

04:55.833 --> 04:58.497
which is pretty good. So I'd be a 3.5 today. Right, 
and I never went below a 2.25 my first two years. As I

05:07.749 --> 05:20.066
advanced in the Corps of Cadets in leadership, I 
began majoring more in Corps of Cadets than I was

05:07.749 --> 05:20.066
majoring in math and minoring in Russian, so my 
grades started suffering my junior and senior

05:07.749 --> 05:20.066
years. But I never went below a 2 point. the which 
would be a three-point today right and when when

05:23.339 --> 05:53.228
did you first go home the first the first time I went 
home was was after Thanksgiving for a couple of

05:23.339 --> 05:53.228
days and the second time I went home was Christmas 
and then there was maybe one of the time I I wouldn't

05:23.339 --> 05:53.228
come home but maybe three times no more than four 
times per year any year that I was at A&M My parents

05:53.917 --> 05:56.760
would come up once a year for Parents' Day. And do 
you remember making a court trip that fall? Yes, I

06:02.805 --> 06:03.406
do. Where? We went to Fort Worth. What was it like? 
Well, it was wonderful, and the key dilemma for us

06:06.249 --> 06:17.680
was we couldn't afford a room, so 15 of us would 
share one room, and it was not fun. A hotel room? A

06:18.620 --> 06:19.221
hotel room. And we, you know, trying to find a place 
to sleep and then that was okay. It's getting ready

06:25.813 --> 06:28.257
in the morning and not having enough. We'd have to 
get up three hours before we were supposed to get

06:29.479 --> 06:32.523
just so we could. How did you get to Fort Worth? We 
caravaned with those freshmen that had cars, and

06:35.287 --> 06:41.917
we went together in groups. As freshmen in the 
outfit, we'd get four or five cars and we'd go down

06:42.819 --> 06:48.147
there. And did you have a date up there? Yes, I did. 
Where did you get one? It was always a blind date

06:52.416 --> 06:58.903
from Texas Women's University in Denton.

07:00.384 --> 07:01.806
But yeah, I never knew. Did you write a letter or did 
somebody arrange it? It was always arranged. And a

07:07.512 --> 07:11.336
lot of times it was the upperclassmen that would 
arrange the dates for the freshmen. And as you

07:11.356 --> 07:17.343
think about it now, how were those young ladies 
treated by the Aggies? Oh, some were treated... I

07:20.738 --> 07:30.271
mean, Aggies were never rude to the ladies, but 
sometimes,

07:20.738 --> 07:30.271
you know, the worst thing that I would hear was that 
they weren't the most beautiful. Because we

07:32.114 --> 07:34.778
weren't, you know, you didn't pick them. Somebody 
else would pick them. But they were always, you

07:36.460 --> 07:42.088
know, glad to be with an Aggie. Some Aggies are 
crude, but most are gentlemen. Most are

07:45.410 --> 07:46.151
gentlemen. All right. How did you meet them 
physically? Where did you? We would meet at the

07:52.160 --> 07:59.030
hotel room where we were staying, and somehow 
there would be an arrangement. So they'd get down

07:59.170 --> 08:01.213
from Denton down to Fort Worth. That's correct. We 
wouldn't go pick them up. And normally did they

08:03.457 --> 08:06.000
watch the march? Yes, they did. And then go to the 
game. That's correct. Then was there an

08:10.166 --> 08:12.750
after-the-game event? There was normally a dance 
after the game. At that time, things were a lot more

08:18.194 --> 08:20.536
organized. You did things in groups. It was not 
done like Hector and Sally are going to go here and

08:23.039 --> 08:29.447
Frank and Betty are going to go there. Everything 
was arranged. Again, my recollection was that

08:31.309 --> 08:41.100
upperclassmen in my outfit and in other outfits 
would help arrange some of these things. The,

08:41.536 --> 08:50.770
these ladies, you had a dance on Saturday night. 
Did you all have a moose pot, beast bucket?

08:57.379 --> 09:04.410
Haskell, you've obviously been talking to other 
folks, but yes, we would have a moose pot and, you

08:57.379 --> 09:04.410
know, the ugliest girl would, you know. How much 
money would you put into the pot? Seventy-five

09:07.094 --> 09:08.436
cents to a dollar. Okay. No more than that. But yes, 
we would definitely try to pick the grossest girl.

09:17.705 --> 09:20.168
And the grossest girl was never really the ugliest 
girl. It was usually the fattest girl. Were you all

09:23.272 --> 09:27.417
aware that they had a pot quite often also? No, I was 
not aware of that. As to which guy was the dullest,

09:28.698 --> 09:31.221
the dreariest? Do you remember anything on any 
court trip you went on, do you remember hearing

09:33.224 --> 09:40.753
about anything that really was bad that happened?

09:44.260 --> 09:44.540
No. All right, of your four years, which were the 
best for you, which were the most enjoyable Corps

09:45.021 --> 09:53.113
trips? To which place? The most enjoyable Corps 
trip I ever made was coming to Austin, Texas, and

09:54.876 --> 10:08.175
there's nothing, when I was a senior, and I 
happened to be the Corps commander, marching up

10:08.915 --> 10:22.938
Congress Avenue towards the Capitol, leading the 
Corps of Cadets, having my mother and father

10:08.915 --> 10:22.938
invited to the reviewing stand and seeing their 
eyes as her son passed by. That's something, yeah.

10:26.103 --> 10:36.019
And my mother, Haskell, wanted to look the 
prettiest she could ever look and she happened to

10:26.103 --> 10:36.019
have, she bought a dress and it was orange and I was 
so embarrassed. that my mother wore this

10:36.505 --> 10:38.947
beautiful orange dress. My father was in a suit. I 
can't believe they were wearing suits and nice

10:41.470 --> 10:46.935
dresses to a football game, but people dressed up 
more back then. But, you know, having my brothers

10:48.416 --> 11:01.569
and sisters there with me and them not 
understanding what the Corps of Cadets was, but

10:48.416 --> 11:01.569
then seeing the entire Corps march up Congress 
Avenue with the Aggie Band, it was something else.

11:01.829 --> 11:02.810
Oh, that's so special. Another highlight for me 
was It wasn't a court trip, but it was, you know, at a

11:06.172 --> 11:14.461
gubernatorial inauguration, but for the Ross 
Volunteers to be the honor guard for Governor

11:06.172 --> 11:14.461
Preston Smith. Oh, Preston Smith. And I remember 
coming to that. When, on the senior court trip, who

11:19.026 --> 11:25.813
else would have been, what other dignitaries 
would have been on the viewing stand? Were there

11:26.494 --> 11:29.597
some state officials?

11:30.235 --> 11:40.428
People from the Former Students Association, of 
course, all the,

11:30.235 --> 11:40.428
we called it the trigon, all the trigon brass was 
there. They'd always have former

11:40.468 --> 11:48.579
students who were generals on the reviewing 
stand. It was more military-based, and they'd

11:48.860 --> 11:58.352
have politicians on it, but at that point, I didn't 
know the difference between a state

11:48.860 --> 11:58.352
representative and a governor. All right, where 
did you all form down near the bridge? It was

12:01.145 --> 12:05.633
always, it was, I mean, I remember exactly, it was 
in front of the Stephen F. Austin Hotel. Oh, okay.

12:06.535 --> 12:10.302
And it's just been renovated, and it was, that's 
exactly where the reviewing stand was. And you

12:10.323 --> 12:11.946
marched north to the Capitol? We would assemble 
around 1st or 2nd Street, and we would march north.

12:16.270 --> 12:19.073
to the Capitol, take a right on 11th Street. The 
band was always at 11th and Congress towards the

12:19.553 --> 12:25.420
left in front of the mansion. I can remember every 
detail about that. Do you remember on any court

12:30.805 --> 12:38.333
trip the crowd of observers ever being rude or 
crude to the... I can't remember that, but I do

12:40.295 --> 12:45.180
remember the

12:45.970 --> 12:57.496
crudeness of fans at Rice and crudeness of fans at 
University of Texas. During the game? During the

12:59.861 --> 13:05.734
game and after the game when we would lose because 
we weren't winning many games and the poor Aggies

12:59.861 --> 13:05.734
was something that That's the only time that I saw 
the corps act in a less than professional manner

13:06.018 --> 13:34.320
because the taunting was such that some of the 
Aggies who were very proud of the fact that we wore

13:06.018 --> 13:34.320
the uniform and that we felt like we should be 
treated better as guests, but the poor Aggie

13:06.018 --> 13:34.320
taunting would create the chant of corps fight and 
corps fight meant you did anything you could to

13:34.975 --> 13:43.688
defend yourself, and you were always outnumbered 
when a court fight was yelled. All right, so you go

13:44.489 --> 13:48.235
home at Thanksgiving and Christmas your freshman 
year. How were you feeling about A&M by then?

13:54.444 --> 13:57.388
Obviously, was proud have gone there but it was 
always more comfortable being at home the food was

13:58.010 --> 14:25.654
much better the love was greater and the comfort 
was certainly more accommodating so whenever I

13:58.010 --> 14:25.654
went back my stomach would turn and I used to tell my 
mother and father an hour before I would be picked

13:58.010 --> 14:25.654
up please leave me alone in the living room Because 
to this day, I hate goodbyes from people I love,

14:26.258 --> 14:32.748
especially when I'm going to be far away from them. 
And A&M seemed like it was extremely far from

14:32.768 --> 14:40.599
Laredo. In those days, you couldn't drive more 
than 50 miles an hour, 55 miles an hour. And so it

14:49.553 --> 14:52.497
would take a good six, seven hours to get home. And I 
can remember driving back, I really wouldn't feel

14:56.144 --> 15:04.474
terribly bad or have a tummy ache until I got beyond 
the pass drop. And then when I could see the Brazos

15:05.195 --> 15:25.240
River, I could see the lights of Bryan College 
Station, and certainly when I could see the lights

15:05.195 --> 15:25.240
of the football field, you would begin, your 
stomach would begin to turn and your heart would

15:05.195 --> 15:25.240
begin to thump hard. because you were always, you 
always knew that you couldn't be totally prepared

15:25.473 --> 15:31.962
for what they had in store for you. All right, as 
your freshman year ends, you go for the first time

15:31.982 --> 15:38.392
through final review. On the second march, second 
part, when you are now, have moved up, how did you

15:38.412 --> 15:49.708
feel about being ready to be a sophomore? It's all 
been worth it, and it sure took a long time to get

15:50.735 --> 15:53.860
here. Then you go home that summer. What did you do? 
That summer I went home and I worked at Sears to earn

15:58.026 --> 16:06.558
some extra money and worked in the supply 
department at Sears. And I worked at Sears every

16:07.400 --> 16:12.727
summer, my freshman, sophomore, and junior. What 
kind of pay? Do you remember? I

16:14.390 --> 16:19.898
don't remember the hourly. It was a minimum wage, 
plus maybe a dollar more above the minimum wage.

16:25.765 --> 16:26.987
And was that extra? That was a lot of money back 
then. Was that extra spending money in addition to

16:27.968 --> 16:30.892
what your parents? Yes, it was extra spending 
money. All right, and so you head back at the end of

16:33.716 --> 16:37.902
that summer as a sophomore. Did you begin to feel 
you were making progress in the Corps and in your

16:39.804 --> 16:46.613
academics? I did. I did. I was a, you know, 
best-drilled freshman, and I began to be very

16:48.481 --> 17:01.763
active in some student affairs at the Memorial 
Student Center, which was... Why? How did that

17:02.845 --> 17:03.726
come about? I wanted something beyond the core. I 
didn't want all of my experience to be core. Now,

17:09.897 --> 17:13.763
that was a little bit controversial because The 
Memorial Student Center was known as the place

17:14.435 --> 17:40.138
where civilians also hung out, and it was the place 
where

17:14.435 --> 17:40.138
things other than military occurred, and 
therefore, if you were over there, you might be

17:14.435 --> 17:40.138
unduly influenced by subversives, or by 
liberals, or by people that didn't think the way we

17:14.435 --> 17:40.138
did, and I Again, that course in great books and 
that exposure to those kind of people said to me, I

17:40.692 --> 17:51.743
don't care what people think, you know, I'm going 
to do what I think I need to do. So I've always had a

17:51.784 --> 17:57.590
little bit of rebel in me, and I didn't realize that 
I had rebel in me at that point. I do now, but that was

17:58.330 --> 18:01.053
the rebel in me coming out. Did anybody, as you 
think back, did anybody encourage you to do MSC?

18:06.275 --> 18:07.878
things?

18:09.662 --> 18:15.554
There were some people that I looked up to that were 
involved in town hall, especially, because I like

18:09.662 --> 18:15.554
students.

18:19.021 --> 18:25.735
I can remember, I can't remember all the names of 
the folks, but I can remember people that seemed to

18:26.272 --> 18:53.747
be leaders in the Corps, I'm talking about juniors 
and seniors, seemed to be people that also did

18:26.272 --> 18:53.747
things outside the Corps, and where I would see 
them was at town hall activities, because they had

18:26.272 --> 18:53.747
a special ribbon, or they, there was something 
that they wore, oh, it was the, they had an ascot

18:26.272 --> 18:53.747
that was a different color, it was a maroon ascot, 
and I thought the maroon ascot was neat, and I

18:26.272 --> 18:53.747
wanted to wear one one of those days. When did you 
meet that fellow named J. Wayne Stark? Do you

18:57.057 --> 18:57.558
remember? I met J. Wayne Stark my sophomore year, 
and the person that I got really close to, in

18:58.179 --> 19:13.187
addition to Wayne being like a father to me, was 
Ruth Hewitt, and her she and her husband were like

19:13.488 --> 19:16.512
second parents to me. So I still remember their 
address. It's 1509 Bennett and Ruth still lives in

19:20.918 --> 19:23.682
that house. Now she was on William's staff? She was 
the secretary. That's what I thought. And so I'd go

19:28.629 --> 19:37.381
to their home on weekends just to get away from the 
Corps and have that special food and that extra

19:28.629 --> 19:37.381
comfort I talked about. And so I became part of that 
family, and she adopted me as like one of her sons.

19:45.083 --> 19:50.470
And I began dealing with Wayne as a sophomore.

19:54.576 --> 20:09.516
During your years, did you run into any famous 
students, students whose parents were rich or

19:54.576 --> 20:09.516
potent politicians, or were there celebrity 
students at any? I met,

20:10.019 --> 20:31.572
Fort Albritton Jr. was one of my classmates, and I 
knew that he was wealthy, and I knew that his father

20:10.019 --> 20:31.572
was active,

20:10.019 --> 20:31.572
but I don't know whether he was famous or not, but 
you know, Mike Casey was one of my

20:32.902 --> 20:41.493
classmates in Hellcat 9, and his father was a 
congressman. So there was some fame there. But how

20:43.476 --> 20:50.525
were the children of prominent people, how were 
they treated at A&M compared to everybody else? To

20:51.726 --> 20:53.048
my knowledge, no different. I mean, there weren't 
any, sure, there weren't any special favors, and

20:53.568 --> 21:01.879
you didn't know who was rich or who was poor. Um, 
nobody knew whether I was from Welth or not, um,

21:02.483 --> 21:12.912
until they went, until they came to my home and they 
saw that, that we had only a two-bedroom house that

21:02.483 --> 21:12.912
were five children. And, you know, maybe they came 
from a home that had a house, I mean, a bedroom for

21:12.932 --> 21:18.497
every child. And my house, five of us slept in one 
room. Were there any giveaway, uh, courses,

21:21.339 --> 21:28.946
courses that people took when they knew their... 
Haskell, no, there... Were there any special

21:28.966 --> 21:31.208
courses for the athletes?

21:33.922 --> 21:41.175
They had special tutoring, but they didn't have 
any special, they didn't have courses just for

21:33.922 --> 21:41.175
them, but they did have tutors that we didn't have. 
As far as I know, you're correct. And

21:45.082 --> 21:55.440
as you're feeling, as you're in your sophomore 
year, you're getting deeper and immersed in all of

21:45.082 --> 21:55.440
the activities. When did you begin to dream about 
maybe being high-ranking in the Corps. When did

22:02.832 --> 22:04.535
you begin to dream of that? I really didn't think 
that I could achieve that until I was, you know, a

22:05.136 --> 22:16.095
junior, and I'd been selected for Corps staff. 
Very competitive. That's the toughest interview

22:18.533 --> 22:20.335
I've ever been through. Now that came during 
your... That came during my sophomore year. There

22:23.438 --> 22:25.521
were six of us picked to be on core staff. Do you have 
any idea what the basis of the selection of those

22:25.661 --> 22:30.026
six was? Yes, I do. I think one of the primary basis 
for selection was composure. Imagine yourself in

22:46.484 --> 23:07.243
a conference room with

22:46.484 --> 23:07.243
six to ten upperclassmen,

22:46.484 --> 23:07.243
and they're all asking you questions at one time, 
and you know that there are 30 to 40 people

22:46.484 --> 23:07.243
competing, and how I was selected to even be 
allowed to go into that room and compete with those

23:07.865 --> 23:12.651
30 or 40. I don't know how that occurred, but there 
had to have been some kind of process that the

23:12.852 --> 23:25.648
upperclassmen used to say, well, from this outfit 
or from this wing, we're going to send X amount of

23:12.852 --> 23:25.648
people to compete. Because I certainly didn't 
have any buddies that were on Corps staff or any

23:26.589 --> 23:34.460
ends or any special access. And you were not an 
affirmative action... I don't

23:38.341 --> 23:43.188
believe I was. I might have been, but I don't think. 
I mean, I just, I've never felt. I mean, anything

23:50.578 --> 24:00.011
I've ever done, I believe I've gotten done because 
of some quality that I apparently bring. I think

24:00.031 --> 24:03.336
the main thing that got me through that interview 
was my composure and my self-confidence. And

24:06.675 --> 24:08.998
these are students doing the interview? All 
students. As you think back about the questions,

24:10.520 --> 24:17.350
were they appropriate questions?

24:17.610 --> 24:18.211
They weren't. All the questions were either 
dealing with current events, Corps Cadets

24:18.932 --> 24:29.567
matters, or, you know, how quickly you could think 
on your feet. They weren't. These are juniors and

24:30.789 --> 24:32.091
seniors. these were most all these were all the 
people that were asking me the questions were

24:32.611 --> 24:56.475
primarily yeah they were juniors and seniors 
because they were juniors encore staff and

24:32.611 --> 24:56.475
seniors encore staff all right how did you learn 
that you had been selected after the interview how

24:32.611 --> 24:56.475
many were you the only one or was it six there were 
six of us on core staff how did you six learn that you

24:32.611 --> 24:56.475
had been selected I don't remember the exact 
details, but I just know that word came down from my

24:56.962 --> 25:09.902
company commander, and I found out through my 
outfit that I'd been selected, and it was... What

24:56.962 --> 25:09.902
did your outfit do? Did they have any special 
ceremony for you? There was no special ceremony. I

25:15.230 --> 25:22.902
had, in essence, become a staff rat, and I was 
leaving the ordinary group. the ordinary group of

25:23.101 --> 25:49.055
people, and I say ordinary, I was leaving my outfit 
and going to something else, and therefore I was

25:23.101 --> 25:49.055
treated as if, yes, I was getting a special 
privilege, and I think they were proud, but I was

25:23.101 --> 25:49.055
also being given a different class status, and 
there was some resentment. You were kind of a

25:49.575 --> 25:50.897
deserter? Yes, I was seen not as a deserter, but 
that I was becoming a staff rat, and staff rats were

25:52.733 --> 26:22.723
people that enforced the rules, that made sure 
that things did not get out of hand, that were seen

25:52.733 --> 26:22.723
as the elite of the Corps, and

25:52.733 --> 26:22.723
some of the people that used to be my peers began to 
see me as a little bit elevated and therefore there

26:23.345 --> 26:45.195
was resentment and that's the first time you begin 
to see, you really begin to see differences in

26:23.345 --> 26:45.195
people when you begin to be junior and senior 
because the rank differences are so varied. When

26:45.575 --> 26:51.343
you're a freshman there are no differences and 
when you're a sophomore there's only two ranks.

26:51.483 --> 26:52.204
Once you become a junior the the breadth of rank 
structure is greater and when you become a senior

26:52.707 --> 27:14.749
it's even it's even greater than that so you think 
this is the spring of your sophomore year which

26:52.707 --> 27:14.749
would have been 60 66 spring of 66 and uh spring of 67 
67 67 And do you move, you don't physically

27:14.915 --> 27:20.501
relocate your dorm room until the fall? Until the 
fall. You're still in, and they didn't do anything

27:21.683 --> 27:28.150
to your room or? No. Didn't drown you out? No, no, 
no, no, no, no. No, there wasn't any, and you know, I

27:31.974 --> 27:40.163
can remember Frank Davis, who was my roommate at 
that point, was also sent to staff, to wing staff,

27:31.974 --> 27:40.163
and so You know, it turned out that the two of us that 
were rooming together, I go to Corps Staff, the

27:40.818 --> 27:46.387
other one went to Wing Staff. How did you inform 
your mom and dad about that? Did you write them a

27:50.693 --> 27:51.795
letter or call them? I wrote them a letter, or I 
think I maybe called them on the phone. Now, you

27:54.599 --> 27:56.583
didn't have a steady girlfriend at that time? At 
that time, I did not have a steady girlfriend. I

28:00.909 --> 28:04.615
think I got a steady girlfriend my... So there was 
nobody else to... No, I got the steady girlfriend.

28:10.518 --> 28:15.925
My junior and senior year, I had a girlfriend by the 
name of Melita Ruiz, R-U-I-Z. It was a blonde,

28:15.945 --> 28:19.930
blue-eyed girl from Laredo. All right, so you go 
home that summer, work again at Sears, then come

28:19.950 --> 28:25.177
back in the fall. Describe the routine for a new 
staff. Corps staff. Corps staff. You have a

28:32.266 --> 28:32.907
cookie. Let me take a break real quick. The new 
routine for a young junior staff officer? The new

28:41.318 --> 28:43.661
routine was a responsibility. I was supply 
sergeant. I had to make sure that every outfit had

28:44.682 --> 28:56.556
the proper supplies and that the every outfit 
needed certain

28:57.397 --> 29:07.569
You know, they had certain needs, like rifles in 
the Army, and where they cleaned, did they have the

28:57.397 --> 29:07.569
oil to clean them? So my job was supply sergeant, 
and there were only six of us on Corps staff. And

29:12.596 --> 29:13.757
that's for the whole Corps? For the entire Corps of 
Cadets. So I had responsibilities for the entire

29:15.799 --> 29:25.311
Corps, and obviously Corps staff, leads, the 
Corps cadets in all marches. They lead the Corps

29:28.488 --> 29:32.353
cadets on Corps trips. They lead the Corps cadets 
in all football games. And so there was some

29:34.616 --> 29:40.264
stature associated with being on Corps staff. 
Now, the Corps commander my junior year was an Air

29:40.284 --> 29:55.264
Force officer, or an Air Force, Lonnie Minz was his 
name, M-I-N-Z-E.

29:40.284 --> 29:55.264
And during those days, the Corps commanders 
position alternated between Air Force and Army.

30:00.447 --> 30:01.388
It was that way always. And so I knew when I was a 
junior that there was no way that I could be Corps

30:02.549 --> 30:12.780
Commander because I was in the Air Force. So did I 
desire the top spot? Yes. Did I think it was even

30:18.006 --> 30:21.890
possible to achieve? Probably not. five foot six. 
Most Corps commanders were six foot tall with

30:27.954 --> 30:52.048
blonde hair and blue eyes, and they didn't have the 
last name Gutierrez, so I had some odds stacked

30:27.954 --> 30:52.048
against me, but

30:27.954 --> 30:52.048
I guess what sort of compelled me my junior year to 
be the very best that I could be was that I like to

30:52.670 --> 31:11.138
compete and, you know, compete in a way that isn't 
too, too obvious so that you can have the respect of

30:52.670 --> 31:11.138
your peers, which is very important in achieving 
any kind of success at A&M, is if you don't have the

30:52.670 --> 31:11.138
respect of your own peers, you don't get anything 
done. So you have to compete, yet not come across to

31:11.980 --> 31:17.428
your peers as being too...
