00:04.655 --> 00:06.457
Okay, this is just a sound check. Bob, say 
something. Hello, my name is Bob.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.964
How many people check this door here? Probably 
like 100. I don't know why they can't have it open.

00:16.247 --> 00:25.237
Okay, this is Ron Shorn, and I'm interviewing Bob 
Havlin at the American Astronomical Society

00:16.247 --> 00:25.237
Berkeley meeting on June 6, 1993. So, Bob, for the 
record, what's your full name? Robert James

00:29.201 --> 00:30.903
Havlin. How do you spell that? H-A-V-L-E-N. Where 
were you born? Utica, New York. And when? 1943. A

00:38.228 --> 00:38.488
date? Oh, yes, September 16. How did you get 
interested in astronomy in the first place? I

00:46.319 --> 00:50.965
think it was a Boy Scout project or a science fair 
project when I was in the sixth or seventh grade. I

00:51.385 --> 00:53.709
had to draw some maps of the night sky and find 
north. That started my desire to look through

00:55.231 --> 01:02.320
telescopes and to buy a telescope and eventually 
made my own telescope and Gradually became more

01:02.992 --> 01:05.976
and more in contact with the astronomical 
community. I was good at school. Where did you go to

01:08.479 --> 01:09.640
undergrad school? Went to the University of 
Rochester. And when did you graduate from there?

01:12.764 --> 01:13.925
1965. And what was your major? Astrophysics. Did 
you start out in astrophysics? I started out in

01:18.871 --> 01:20.233
astrophysics. Why? Why did I start in 
astrophysics? Because with my middle school and

01:24.057 --> 01:30.585
high school experience in making my own telescope 
and reading about astronomy, I decided that was an

01:31.105 --> 01:33.788
area that I wanted to go into. As a matter of fact, I 
only applied as an undergraduate to Cornell and to

01:33.808 --> 01:44.538
the University of Rochester in New York State 
because those were the only schools that had

01:33.808 --> 01:44.538
undergraduate degrees in astronomy. Where did 
you go to grad school and why? I went to the

01:49.163 --> 01:58.011
University of Arizona because I realized that I 
needed to be at a clear sight where I could get into

01:49.163 --> 01:58.011
astronomy. It had a good national reputation. It 
was growing. I applied to the University of

02:01.328 --> 02:03.672
Michigan and to Harvard. I got accepted at 
Michigan, didn't get accepted at Harvard, and

02:04.232 --> 02:12.465
then Arizona and NASA traineeship and so on. It was 
the best decision of my then young life because the

02:12.505 --> 02:23.622
University of Arizona, of course, is right across 
the street from Kitt Peak National Observatory.

02:25.144 --> 02:26.927
So what did you do at Arizona? At Arizona, I... I got 
interested in x-ray astronomy and optical

02:31.467 --> 02:40.575
astronomy and no radio astronomy really. And 
gradually did a thesis under Bengt Westerlund

02:41.256 --> 02:53.287
using photographic data and photoelectric data 
on Cepheids and OB associations and the

02:41.256 --> 02:53.287
relationship of them. And when did you get out? Why 
did you pick that? Why did I pick that? Was it the

02:57.871 --> 02:59.072
person or the field? It was the... Person, 
primarily. I think it was the ease with which I was

03:02.525 --> 03:13.916
able to work with Dr. Westerlund and his vast 
experience in the field of observational optical

03:02.525 --> 03:13.916
astronomy. Of course, I was exposed to almost 
everything there was to be exposed to back in the

03:14.757 --> 03:27.310
late 1960s because of our interaction with Kitt 
Peak National Observatory. And there were

03:27.330 --> 03:30.313
theoreticians around. You know, I did fairly well 
at most of my courses, but I found

03:30.783 --> 03:47.185
after thinking about what I really wanted to do for 
three or four months, I decided that I wanted to go

03:30.783 --> 03:47.185
into studying Cepheids and OB associations with 
Beck. He was an interesting guy. He had lots of

03:49.488 --> 03:59.622
unreduced observational data to work with and was 
inspirational in helping me decide what further

03:49.488 --> 03:59.622
observations were to be made and so on. I think 
that's Sort of a typical interaction. It wasn't a

04:04.138 --> 04:09.848
question of money, as it is these days, because I 
was supported by a NASA traineeship. Was that your

04:10.409 --> 04:14.916
first contact with an ASA? Yes, basically it was.

04:20.826 --> 04:22.869
When did you finish your degree? I finished in late 
1969. When you were a grad student at Stewart, did

04:25.728 --> 04:35.421
any of the infighting, well, or let's put it this 
way, Kuiper and Bart Bock were perhaps not the

04:25.728 --> 04:35.421
world's greatest friends? You know, I didn't 
really get too much feel from that. I mean, Bock

04:40.748 --> 04:46.656
came in 1967, after I'd been there a couple of 
years. He was always telling stories about Kuiper

04:47.328 --> 04:58.225
and Bach, and I don't know, there was another guy, 
another Dutchman that came over to the U.S. about

04:47.328 --> 04:58.225
the same time as those two, and I can't remember. I 
think it was a guy

04:58.245 --> 05:07.359
in Peter Zandekamp, was it? No, but it's in Ray 
White's obituary about Bach, so we can look at it.

05:10.825 --> 05:11.866
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of neat. Did... Did people at 
Steward or Kitt Peak look down on planetary work as

05:15.593 --> 05:21.882
far as you know? Did the grad students say, oh, if I 
can't get in with somebody that does stellar work,

05:22.263 --> 05:27.931
I'll have to do planetary work? Was any of that kind 
of stuff still left when you were there? I don't

05:33.279 --> 05:33.860
think so. Now that I think of it,

05:33.900 --> 05:44.335
being a graduate student at Steward was an 
interesting experience because you had lunar and

05:33.900 --> 05:44.335
planetary lab right across the street. And the 
people that did planetary science, like Tom

05:44.939 --> 06:04.040
Garrels, like Pat Romer, I can't think of a few more 
names that were associated with the lunar and

05:44.939 --> 06:04.040
planetary. They were there, yeah, exactly. And I 
never got the feeling that this was...

06:12.884 --> 06:14.426
a secondary science. There was Bill Hartman, for 
example. He was there. I mean, it was interesting

06:16.769 --> 06:17.970
stuff. It just so happened that you really do have a 
difference of opinion as to whether you want to go

06:17.990 --> 06:26.920
into planetary science. I mean, planetary 
science is almost like geology. It's close to

06:28.682 --> 06:29.423
home. And at least that was my feeling. I didn't 
want to get into planetary science. And I knew

06:33.548 --> 06:36.051
other graduate students that really didn't want 
to get into planetary science. They were more

06:36.071 --> 06:37.913
interested in stars and galaxies. And that just is 
sort of a natural, because there were graduate

06:38.551 --> 06:43.037
students. As a matter of fact, Ben Zellner, who's 
now, I guess he does asteroid work with Garrels.

06:54.932 --> 06:57.175
There was Kofin. There was a few other graduate 
students. Planetary science was a real

07:00.740 --> 07:03.544
challenge. It just wasn't something that I wanted 
to get into. Where'd you go after you got your

07:06.207 --> 07:08.490
degree? uh in january of 1970 we packed our bags put 
our car on a boat got on an airplane and went to chile

07:09.213 --> 07:38.798
i uh i became a staff member at the european 
southern observatory and primarily because

07:09.213 --> 07:38.798
westerland my thesis advisor six months earlier 
had become the director there and he said bob why

07:09.213 --> 07:38.798
don't you come down for a year so i said fine a year 
i'll go anywhere ended up being settled What did

07:39.655 --> 07:41.617
you work on there in general? In general, I was a 
staff astronomer, of course, and I had to assist in

07:42.498 --> 07:55.933
all the equipment for all the visiting 
astronomers in terms of Kude spectrographs,

07:42.498 --> 07:55.933
Castorine spectrographs, single channel 
photometers, and so on. And I continued my

07:56.754 --> 08:05.764
interest in OB associations and started 
surveying some of the southern Milky Way in terms

07:56.754 --> 08:05.764
of accumulating data that would allow us to then 
determine whether or not the young blue stars we

08:06.352 --> 08:16.347
were detecting were actually members of 
associations or whether they were just in the

08:06.352 --> 08:16.347
field. And when did you leave there and why? I left 
there in May of 1977 and we'd been in Chile seven

08:20.313 --> 08:34.435
years and our daughters were then one and four 
years so we decided to come back to the States and We

08:34.938 --> 08:38.083
didn't want our kids growing up Chilean, 
basically. And the position I got in the US was as a

08:39.244 --> 08:45.994
lecturer at the University of Virginia in 
Charlottesville. And I found it very difficult to

08:47.116 --> 08:54.587
look for a position from outside the US to get back 
into the US. And so I was very grateful to be able to

08:54.647 --> 09:01.637
get some kind of temporary position from which I 
could use as a base to look for a more permanent

08:54.647 --> 09:01.637
position. And that fell into place, 
unfortunately, upon the death of Nelson

09:02.174 --> 09:10.983
Lindbergh. This is D. Nelson Lindbergh. D. Nelson 
Lindbergh, exactly. And so what was this

09:14.147 --> 09:16.329
permanent placement? Well, the position I got was 
University of Virginia as lecturer. And I was

09:20.473 --> 09:24.738
actually on the staff there for two years. And at 
the end of the second year. Which would be 1979. In

09:28.955 --> 09:43.669
the middle 90s, after academic year 78, 79, I then 
took up a position at the National Radio Astronomy

09:28.955 --> 09:43.669
Observatory, more of an administrative position 
as assistant to the director with Mark Roberts. At

09:44.670 --> 09:54.440
that point, it was better not to have to move the 
family than to go to Washington, D.C. or someplace

09:44.670 --> 09:54.440
like that. Why did they pick you? I was a warm body. 
No, Mort Roberts and I got along very well. I had

10:01.267 --> 10:08.296
worked earlier as a summer student at NRAO in 1964 
in Greenbank with Mort. And I was interested in an

10:09.117 --> 10:14.444
administrative position because I had been 
interviewed. Actually, I had been offered a job at

10:14.584 --> 10:18.929
the National Science Foundation by Bill Howard. 
And so I was trying to decide, did I want to leave

10:19.750 --> 10:25.017
Charlottesville and move to Washington or what? 
And Mort had just taken a position as director at

10:25.037 --> 10:29.202
NRAO about six months earlier. And he realized 
that he needed help. So for me, it was a new

10:32.518 --> 10:35.422
challenge I was happy to move into. How long did you 
stay there? Oh, I was with the NRAO, actually,

10:38.447 --> 10:42.814
until just the beginning of this year. I was in 
Charlottesville until mid-1988. So that's 11

10:46.880 --> 10:52.489
years in Charlottesville and an additional four 
years in Socorro. At the VLA. At the VLA, right.

10:57.273 --> 11:07.530
When you first went into the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory, did you notice any

10:57.273 --> 11:07.530
difference between optical and radio 
astronomers? As a matter of fact, I did. I've

11:10.074 --> 11:13.600
always noticed a difference between optical and 
radio astronomers. You want to know what that

11:14.542 --> 11:15.683
difference is? Yes, you mean going back to grad 
school days? Yeah, basically. I mean, in grad

11:19.748 --> 11:23.973
school, I have to admit that I never really came 
across that many radio astronomers. Oh, there was

11:24.034 --> 11:30.461
Frank Lowe, and there was the odd, I mean... Rare. 
The rare radio astronomer that would come

11:30.642 --> 11:33.926
through. We did have one radio astronomer on the 
staff, one official, quote-unquote, radio

11:34.406 --> 11:43.317
astronomer on the staff at the University of 
Arizona, and that was Andrei Pahulchik. And he

11:44.005 --> 11:57.217
taught the course in radio astronomy, and I found 
radio astronomy to be much, much greater, much

11:44.005 --> 11:57.217
more intensity in real physics. That is, radio 
astronomers seem much more solidly based and

11:57.918 --> 12:10.269
solidly ground, if you will, in

11:57.918 --> 12:10.269
techniques and a theory of physics. The 
frustration, of course, with the radio

12:12.001 --> 12:16.447
astronomers, I found, of course, was that they 
didn't have any good angular resolution. They had

12:16.507 --> 12:19.492
instrumentation that they had to be extremely 
careful with. It seemed to me that radio

12:19.552 --> 12:29.166
astronomers knew a lot more about the inner 
workings of the computer than optical. I can't

12:29.246 --> 12:30.367
take that back. Optical astronomers generally 
knew a lot about their spectrographs and their

12:30.447 --> 12:37.838
polarimeters and photometers because they had to 
make it work. Radio astronomers... however, had

12:39.473 --> 12:49.128
found the nice technique of relying upon a really 
high-quality staff of radio engineers and

12:39.473 --> 12:49.128
computer scientists. And so the actual 
astronomers really didn't know that much about

12:49.168 --> 12:59.884
the black boxes they were using, but the people 
that did made everything work exceedingly well.

13:00.204 --> 13:05.312
And at the NRIO, I noticed that most of the radio 
astronomers that I dealt with hardly ever would,

13:05.731 --> 13:09.617
they sort of looked down upon optical astronomy. 
They didn't care really what a spectral type was or

13:09.657 --> 13:15.186
what constellation or anything like that. They 
were really retooled physicists or retooled ham

13:15.206 --> 13:22.176
radio operators more than anything. Whereas 
optical astronomers tended to be types that got

13:22.717 --> 13:34.135
excited about astronomy from hands-on observing 
experiences when they were either in high school

13:22.717 --> 13:34.135
or college. And there was a rare optical 
astronomer who got into optical astronomy

13:34.672 --> 13:46.067
because they were good in physics and they were 
good in theory and then got pushed into optical

13:34.672 --> 13:46.067
astronomy. But in general, I thought the problems 
that radio astronomers were asking and were able

13:46.107 --> 14:00.105
to answer were a lot more in-depth in physics and 
global problems than optical astronomers were

13:46.107 --> 14:00.105
asking. Maybe that was naive, but that's my 
impression. Okay, so this year, early this year, I

14:02.667 --> 14:10.360
guess, you left Socorro, and where did you go? I 
left the... Actually, I left the NRAO, and I left

14:10.400 --> 14:20.356
Socorro both at the same time, and I'm now 
executive director of the Astronomical Society

14:10.400 --> 14:20.356
of the Pacific. And for me, it's an ideal position 
because... You know, I've sort of been a hybrid

14:24.622 --> 14:27.765
between optical and radio astronomy. I've never 
really put my solid foot down and said, this is my

14:27.785 --> 14:35.393
area, and I am pigeonholed forever. I just really 
get excited about all problems in astronomy, and

14:35.433 --> 14:45.384
I've always been involved with public outreach 
and public information since coming back to the

14:35.433 --> 14:45.384
NRAO. When I was in Chile, of course, I was working 
hand-in-hand in glove with all the visiting

14:50.069 --> 14:52.071
astronomers. So I got to see a broad perspective of 
the type of problems that everybody that came to

14:52.091 --> 14:57.717
the observatory was working on. And then when I 
came back to the U.S., I was involved with radio

14:58.418 --> 15:02.262
astronomy. So then I got a perspective of what it 
is, what it means to be a millimeter-wave

15:02.282 --> 15:13.174
astronomer or a centimeter-wave astronomer, or 
even a long-wave astronomer, and what the

15:02.282 --> 15:13.174
problems of resolution are. and different 
wavelength approaches to different problems.

15:17.467 --> 15:27.398
And so I found myself with quite a large global 
perspective that I guess I'm really now able to

15:17.467 --> 15:27.398
take advantage of in my dealings with the 
astronomical community. Why did you make this

15:27.759 --> 15:28.920
last jump? Was it because the opportunity was 
there? Basically, it was the opportunity was

15:31.343 --> 15:33.225
there. Andy Fracknoy had been the executive 
director of the Astronomical Society of the

15:33.265 --> 15:42.216
Pacific for the last 14 years or so. I saw the 
advertisement in one of the, I think it was the

15:42.922 --> 15:55.514
AAS's job newsletter, and said, I read the 
description, you know, it must be this, it must be

15:42.922 --> 15:55.514
that, and experience of this, experience of that. 
I said, you know, this is a job I can do. I can do all

15:58.437 --> 16:00.399
that stuff. I almost replied to that myself, and 
that would have been some competition, except

16:00.759 --> 16:09.068
that this NASA contract was already looking good. 
I see, I see. We already had word that we got it, you

16:09.888 --> 16:12.591
know, so... And also I have to add that it was more or 
less an opportunity for me to be my own boss, as it

16:14.022 --> 16:20.871
were. It's kind of hard to work year after year 
after year, sometimes having ideas that your boss

16:21.051 --> 16:29.583
doesn't necessarily share, enthusiasm, 
support, and so on. And now in this position, I can

16:30.243 --> 16:33.848
sort of make it or break it. I can pave new ground if I 
really get enough energy up to do it. So you've done

16:39.676 --> 16:42.780
optical, you've done radio, and now you have... I 
have to do everything. I have to do everything.

16:45.242 --> 16:49.387
Which is one of the reasons I want to interview, 
because I'm going to start asking you some

16:45.242 --> 16:49.387
questions now today.

16:53.792 --> 17:07.089
How important do you think NASA money was to 
helping astronomy in general and planetary

16:53.792 --> 17:07.089
astronomy in particular take

16:53.792 --> 17:07.089
off? Well, I don't know where to begin to answer 
that question, of course, For NASA, to answer

17:12.730 --> 17:35.329
about the importance of NASA money to astronomy in 
general, I'd say that the educational

17:12.730 --> 17:35.329
opportunities that NASA money afforded to people 
like me, even though I never ended up in planetary

17:12.730 --> 17:35.329
astronomy, the research that I did never really 
affected any of the NASA missions. It was really

17:35.748 --> 17:47.744
invaluable at the time because I was able to go 
through graduate study without worrying about

17:35.748 --> 17:47.744
teaching assistants or outside jobs or what have 
you. Of course, I've seen the NASA money and the

17:48.905 --> 18:01.261
support that it provided to the, I guess it was the 
Mount Lemmon 61-inch telescope and all the

17:48.905 --> 18:01.261
research work that got done there. NASA money... 
You know, the telescope on Mauna Kea, there's a

18:05.718 --> 18:12.985
NASA telescope there, infrared facility. 
There's two, there's the 88 inch and the IRT.

18:16.649 --> 18:18.151
That's right, that's right. And I think in 
hindsight I would say NASA probably could have put

18:18.171 --> 18:33.166
more money in ground support to some of their 
missions than they did. I mean, it's always Ground

18:35.705 --> 18:45.939
support has always been looked upon by the people 
in national centers as only funded by the National

18:35.705 --> 18:45.939
Science Foundation. The question has always been 
raised, for example, how much impact will the

18:47.422 --> 19:00.480
space telescope or any of the other NASA-funded 
orbiting telescopes have on ground-based

19:00.967 --> 19:05.092
facilities? And should NSF worry about having to 
fund more ground support and so on? I mean, you get

19:13.983 --> 19:17.828
the idea that the...

19:20.931 --> 19:30.383
I think we've always worried about is

19:20.931 --> 19:30.383
the demand for ground support going to overwhelm 
the telescopes on the ground once we get all these

19:31.257 --> 19:36.486
observations from space. And I think the answer 
has been sort of halfway between the real terror

19:36.867 --> 19:46.824
and the optimism. I mean,

19:46.884 --> 19:56.320
my opinion has always been that, hey, there's only 
24 hours in a day and there's a limited number of

19:46.884 --> 19:56.320
astronomers. And if they're off getting X-ray 
data, they don't have time to be getting radio data

19:56.705 --> 20:03.371
from the ground or optical data from the ground. 
There's no doubt that every single space

20:04.152 --> 20:17.484
observatory that has returned data has changed 
the character of the proposals that have been

20:04.152 --> 20:17.484
submitted to the ground-based support . I mean, 
for example, back in 1983, when IRS data started

20:18.365 --> 20:25.632
coming down, the 12-meter telescope probably had 
like 40, 50 percent of its proposals for the next

20:26.506 --> 20:40.325
three or four years were always mentioning IRS 
data this and IRS data this and we're following up

20:26.506 --> 20:40.325
this from IRS and that from IRS. Basically, the 
number of proposals did not overall to the

20:41.106 --> 20:45.733
telescope didn't increase. The character of the 
proposals changed because researchers were

20:45.973 --> 20:51.501
getting data from infrared and now they wanted to 
compare it to multi-wavelength. That's exactly

20:53.107 --> 20:57.674
paralleled in planetary ground-based observing 
every time a probe goes by. Exactly, exactly,

20:57.914 --> 20:59.877
exactly. One question before I forget here, 
because I skipped around a little bit. 30 years

21:04.784 --> 21:08.430
ago, if we'd be in an AAS meeting, there'd just be 
one AAS meeting. Everybody would be in here. Now,

21:10.333 --> 21:13.978
you don't see many planetary papers. You don't see 
many solar papers. We've got all these divisions,

21:15.990 --> 21:26.140
high energy, astrophysics, solar astronomy, 
planetary astronomy, historical astronomy. And

21:26.281 --> 21:29.264
some of them have their own specialized journals 
now. In addition, in the old days, it was APJ, AJ,

21:29.284 --> 21:38.093
and PASB, Publications of the Astronomical 
Society of the Pacific. Do you think these

21:38.512 --> 21:48.042
subdivisions of the AS have been good or bad, or 
just inevitable?

21:51.085 --> 22:07.202
I think you put the nail on the head when you said 
inevitable, because the general expansion of the

21:51.085 --> 22:07.202
field makes it, I mean, even the American Physical 
Society just cannot have a general meeting where

21:51.085 --> 22:07.202
everybody exchanges information in a worthwhile 
manner. on a broad diversity of topics. I mean, as

22:11.350 --> 22:37.476
much as I, in the astronomical side of the Pacific, 
feel that the public needs to be exposed to a broad

22:11.350 --> 22:37.476
range of topics in a general sense, you know, solar 
astronomy, planetary astronomy,

22:11.350 --> 22:37.476
extra-galactic astronomy, all the wavelength 
and so on, and it's good to meld them all into one

22:11.350 --> 22:37.476
sort of uniform picture, at the detailed 
professional level, where you're talking

22:11.350 --> 22:37.476
researcher to researcher, The meetings, and 
especially the division meetings, extremely

22:37.777 --> 22:46.486
important that they're talking on the same 
topics. You would totally dilute the effort if you

22:46.506 --> 22:53.133
were to mix extragalactic types with the division 
meetings. The data transmission rate would be

22:53.153 --> 22:55.776
very low. On the other hand, it's also very 
important, a very important part of these

22:55.996 --> 23:03.344
meetings is to have the overall survey talk. 
You'll find a very high percentage of the members

23:08.135 --> 23:28.316
of the AAS are younger graduate students or people 
that are in academic positions where they're

23:08.135 --> 23:28.316
teaching on all subjects and for them to have a 
broad perspective of what's going on in planetary

23:08.135 --> 23:28.316
science or X-ray astronomy or high energy 
astrophysics or you name it. In this meeting it

23:28.336 --> 23:37.365
seems to be extreme ultraviolet astronomy and in 
other meetings it's been IRAS and sometimes it's

23:28.336 --> 23:37.365
the ultraviolet astro program I mean, it's 
essential to have these overviews sort of cycle

23:37.598 --> 23:55.395
around all the disciplines in astronomy so that 
your younger folks or your people that are

23:37.598 --> 23:55.395
teaching general courses and so on have a good 
perspective of the big picture. You can't chop it

23:55.936 --> 24:01.562
up so little that planetary sciences only go to 
planetary science meetings. It's not fair. Do you

24:04.745 --> 24:07.167
think planetary astronomy is part of astronomy? 
Do I think it's part of astronomy? That's a good

24:11.161 --> 24:12.043
question. I think it is part of astronomy, but I'm 
asking myself, why do I think it's part of

24:13.325 --> 24:19.155
astronomy? We use telescopes. That's right. 
Planetary scientists use telescopes. Some of

24:26.308 --> 24:30.555
them use space probes, however, which are not 
really telescopes. It's more like a remote

24:31.092 --> 24:34.916
geologist. You may have too much knowledge to 
answer, so let me ask you this. You're the big

24:38.920 --> 24:43.385
cheese at the PASB, and you ought to have your 
finger on the pulse of this. Do you think the public

24:44.766 --> 24:48.730
believes planetary astronomy is part of 
astronomy? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. There's no doubt

24:50.752 --> 24:52.174
about that. When people ask general questions 
about astronomy or what draws them into the

24:53.275 --> 25:00.222
interest of astronomy overall, one very 
important part is planetary. After all, that's

25:04.629 --> 25:07.533
what you can show them in a small telescope. I mean, 
granted, they're going to ask questions about the

25:07.553 --> 25:20.011
Big Bang or search for extraterrestrial 
intelligence, but let's not forget that the

25:07.553 --> 25:20.011
search for extraterrestrial intelligence is 
related to planetary systems. And the more we know

25:20.652 --> 25:27.222
about our planetary systems, for example, at the 
ASP, the questions I get from the press are, or

25:27.792 --> 25:38.615
radio and television stations, they increase 
enormously during the time when we have a lunar

25:27.792 --> 25:38.615
eclipse, a solar eclipse, a close cometary 
approach, a meteor shower. These are things that

25:38.976 --> 25:43.506
the public can easily identify because they can 
easily see them. So from the public's

25:43.621 --> 25:50.790
perspective, planetary astronomy may be the only 
part of astronomy they ever come in contact with.

25:51.651 --> 26:01.543
You think, you know, we've had 30 years and now we 
can see details on Jupiter that we never saw, rings

25:51.651 --> 26:01.543
around other planets than Saturn, Mars, pictures 
in the surface. Do you think that's had any effect

26:01.563 --> 26:03.386
on the public? I mean, has it changed the way they 
look at things or their interests in planetary

26:03.446 --> 26:10.174
astronomy, astronomy and science in general? Or 
is it a passing fad? uh you know i think we have to be

26:14.114 --> 26:38.772
careful answer a question like that because i 
think that the space program in general and also

26:14.114 --> 26:38.772
the the detailed information that comes from the 
space probes about other planets in the solar

26:14.114 --> 26:38.772
system has made the public almost take things for 
granted i remember when i was in high school or when

26:14.114 --> 26:38.772
you were in school You know, one space probe, one 
space launch was a fantastic event. Nowadays, we

26:44.566 --> 26:49.150
have shuttles get set up every month or two, and no 
big deal. We don't go through the countdown. We

26:50.852 --> 26:52.794
don't hear anything in the news. You know, we know 
they're up there. We take it for granted that

26:54.196 --> 26:56.178
they're doing good stuff. And another space probe 
goes by. I mean, Voyager was a big deal, no doubt

26:58.800 --> 27:00.762
about it. But, you know, does the public get 
excited about another telescope getting

27:03.025 --> 27:06.328
launched? astronomers make lots of noise about 
it, and the amount of information that comes from

27:06.646 --> 27:14.325
that new telescope can be overwhelming. There's 
just so much data coming down. But the public is

27:17.091 --> 27:22.765
sort of getting...

27:23.774 --> 27:26.298
blase about the whole thing, taking things for 
granted. Here's a question you don't have to be a

27:26.578 --> 27:36.815
planetary astronomer to answer, but you have to 
know something about astronomy and the funding

27:26.578 --> 27:36.815
end and all that, and the public interest end. In 30 
years now, we've looked all over the solar system,

27:37.957 --> 27:47.672
haven't yet found a trace of present or previous 
life anywhere except Earth. In particular, no

27:48.209 --> 27:51.233
green men on Mars, not even a buck. Sure. Do you 
think that's had a negative effect on public

27:52.535 --> 27:56.321
interest funding or not? No, I don't think so. I 
really don't think so. Why don't I think so? That's

28:03.190 --> 28:04.853
the question. I mean, I think the search is fun, and 
the questions always come down from the press or

28:04.873 --> 28:14.807
from people that don't know a lot of details about 
the types of search and so on. that have you found

28:15.175 --> 28:17.658
it? Part

28:17.738 --> 28:40.185
of the problem that the scientist has in 
communicating science to the public

28:17.738 --> 28:40.185
is related to their desire to know the biggest or 
the smallest, the most distant or the closest, the

28:17.738 --> 28:40.185
oldest or the youngest, or what's the latest 
discovery. I mean, they think science is made up of

28:40.205 --> 28:44.170
just eureka discoveries. And they don't really 
understand the scientific curiosity process. So

28:50.888 --> 28:53.371
I think there's an interest in the public. If you 
say that you're looking for extraterrestrial

28:53.551 --> 29:01.541
intelligence or you're looking for life in the 
solar system, that's always a motivation to get

28:53.551 --> 29:01.541
the public interested. They're always going to 
ask you, did you find it?

29:07.387 --> 29:23.421
But part of the challenge of being a scientist is to 
give the public more

29:07.387 --> 29:23.421
appreciation for the fact that it's the hunt 
that's most important. It's the thrill of the

29:24.042 --> 29:27.747
hunt, and that continues no matter what you find. 
You open more unanswered doors than you do, you

29:28.288 --> 29:38.783
know, you always ask more questions after you've 
made an experiment than you answer. It's just

29:38.903 --> 29:39.664
amazing. Here's a two-part question. One, do you 
think astronomers in general have done a good job,

29:41.347 --> 29:49.999
or as good a job as they could have been, in selling 
themselves to the public and to the Congress? And

29:52.038 --> 30:07.588
then I'm going to be specific and say, I believe 
that the radio astronomers have always done their

29:52.038 --> 30:07.588
infighting behind closed doors, spilt the blood 
there, and come out charging with a unified front,

29:52.038 --> 30:07.588
whereas the optical astronomers do all their 
internecine strife on the stage. So pro, con, what

30:09.452 --> 30:12.137
do you think? Yeah. Getting astronomers, getting 
scientists in general, but the scientists I know

30:12.929 --> 30:29.467
best are astronomers, and getting astronomers to 
be forthright and to participate in public

30:12.929 --> 30:29.467
outreach programs is a mixed bag. There's about, I 
would say, like 10% of the astronomers on the staff

30:29.487 --> 30:38.177
of major research facilities that are really 
willing to be science for judges or to give tours to

30:38.731 --> 30:43.456
observatories and so on. I think it's a lot 
different when you get to the academic community

30:43.816 --> 30:53.527
because their people are constantly dealing with 
students and the public, and so the percentage

30:43.816 --> 30:53.527
there probably is much higher. I think, and on that 
basis I would say astronomers really haven't done

30:55.709 --> 31:03.557
a good job, but I mean, how many astronomers do you 
need to have out there One Carl Sagan is worth

31:04.972 --> 31:09.097
10,000 other astronomers. And so it's kind of hard 
to answer that question. Now, related to the

31:11.100 --> 31:15.866
question of optical versus radio, I think you have 
to be very, very careful.

31:18.569 --> 31:32.447
Because radio astronomers have always been 
really totally dependent very soon after the

31:18.569 --> 31:32.447
beginning of radio astronomy. Radio astronomy 
actually began in the 1930s and really wasn't

31:32.933 --> 31:44.910
going full force until the 1950s after the war, and 
very soon thereafter was the creation of national

31:32.933 --> 31:44.910
observatories. So radio astronomers have 
always, not always, but for the most part, have

31:44.930 --> 31:53.522
been using national facilities. You just know 
they cannot spend the money at a local university

31:53.682 --> 32:00.612
to build an instrument big enough, so it's been 
national facilities. And it's a much smaller

32:00.963 --> 32:10.173
population of scientists, let's say probably 
between 10% and 20% of the number of optical

32:00.963 --> 32:10.173
astronomers. And so the people to do the fighting 
are fewer. The efficiency of getting telescope

32:16.460 --> 32:28.152
time for the members of the community because of 
the existence of large national centers like

32:16.460 --> 32:28.152
Arecibo and NRAO and so on, and some major 
university facilities like Owens Valley and so

32:28.790 --> 32:34.218
on. It's much more successful for radio 
astronomers to get telescope time. Optical

32:40.487 --> 32:45.254
astronomers, on the other hand, they come from a 
different community at the outset.

32:45.754 --> 32:55.428
Historically, they grew up in large private 
telescopes like Lick and Mount Palomar and so on.

32:55.448 --> 32:57.531
And so they were in-house type astronomers. And 
only over the course of the last three decades, so

32:58.000 --> 33:11.914
to speak, since the NSF was founded, have you 
gotten astronomers spread out far and wide at

32:58.000 --> 33:11.914
small schools and large schools and everywhere. 
And they don't have their own telescopes. And so

33:15.037 --> 33:26.708
there's the in-group, the people that have their 
own private, as it were, major facility,

33:15.037 --> 33:26.708
University of Texas, Caltech, Those big places, 
Arizona and so on. And those people are sort of the

33:29.860 --> 33:32.544
upper cream. The best scientists there always 
have lots of telescope time. And you've got the

33:36.669 --> 33:42.898
other community out there fighting for telescope 
time because they don't have their own telescopes

33:36.669 --> 33:42.898
over there. It seems to be a much, for one thing, 
it's a much larger community. I'd like to say

33:48.245 --> 33:50.788
before, probably a factor of 10 higher. and 
there's not enough National Facility telescope

33:51.528 --> 34:00.838
time to go around for this large mass of scientists 
that are groping for time. So they tend probably,

34:01.239 --> 34:16.776
you know, when it comes right down to it, it's easy 
to say, you know, you iron your difficulties out in

34:01.239 --> 34:16.776
private, but there's always somebody that walks 
away feeling hurt whenever you have a discussion

34:01.239 --> 34:16.776
about whether planetary science is better than 
extragalactic or ultraviolet is better than

34:17.077 --> 34:21.368
x-ray and so on. Somebody... In that connection, 
planetary astronomy is really half and half. It

34:25.820 --> 34:29.770
shares some characteristics with both, but what 
I'm thinking of, for example, a 10-year

34:30.053 --> 34:31.715
recommendation reports come together. The radio 
astronomers seem to pick one thing and stick with

34:31.735 --> 34:34.760
it. Planetary astronomers pick one thing and 
stick with it. And then stellar and galactic and

34:37.924 --> 34:45.335
extra-galactic optical astronomers keep right 
on fighting even after it comes out. It seems like

34:45.775 --> 34:46.676
it. It always seems that way. It does seem that way. 
But I can tell you that there's plenty of hurt

34:48.239 --> 34:51.984
people in the radio community too. Although they 
came together and endorsed VLBA back in the early

35:00.226 --> 35:26.757
eighties and lo and behold the darn thing is 
constructed now because it was you know it was it

35:00.226 --> 35:26.757
was it was a project that was ready to go when the 
funding became available there are also a lot of

35:00.226 --> 35:26.757
hurt people in the radio community that were 
hoping for a 25 meter millimeter wave dish it never

35:00.226 --> 35:26.757
happened and the NRAO is ready to go with a 
millimeter array I don't know if it'll ever happen

35:27.158 --> 35:34.669
And gradually the astronomers at some of the major 
universities have started to build their own

35:27.158 --> 35:34.669
millimeter array. Millimeter astronomers have 
basically felt like they've been left off. And

35:41.239 --> 35:46.146
it's an extremely powerful field. lately a lot of 
astronomers, and we're talking optical, radio,

35:47.847 --> 36:10.881
planetary, stellar, and whole, have been getting 
a lot of publicity and evidently some money off of

35:47.847 --> 36:10.881
projects that get a lot of public play, like search 
for extraterrestrial intelligence, killer

35:47.847 --> 36:10.881
asteroids, search for other solar systems, ozone 
holes in the Earth's atmosphere. Do you think

36:11.402 --> 36:14.647
they're overdoing that, or not? I think the public 
is extremely interested in these type of

36:17.716 --> 36:21.421
projects, and it's good that they get press. I 
think astronomers have to be careful to spread the

36:21.922 --> 36:34.841
press out to, and I think the AAS does a real good 
job, and Steve Moran in the press office, in

36:21.922 --> 36:34.841
getting the press interested in other ongoing 
critical issues in astronomy. You have to

36:34.861 --> 36:44.736
remember that some of those topics in modern 
astronomy are pretty esoteric and hard to

36:34.861 --> 36:44.736
describe to the public, so killer asteroids and 
SETI and all those planetary-type stuff, that's

36:45.188 --> 36:51.336
when, in one respect, planetary science has an 
advantage. It's easier to communicate the

36:51.356 --> 36:56.343
problem to the public. I don't think we can really 
overdo it, communicating to the public, however.

37:00.849 --> 37:04.834
And what's good for planetary science is in the 
short run because their project is described well

37:05.337 --> 37:08.502
to the press. It's good for astronomers in 
general. Whether it's planetary, radio, or

37:10.625 --> 37:15.352
optical, I think probably all in the same bathtub. 
I mean, all in the same boat. And is the boat sailing

37:17.715 --> 37:20.279
along nicely? Is it dead in the water? Or is it 
sinking in general as far as, say, funding goes and

37:21.741 --> 37:32.998
stuff like

37:21.741 --> 37:32.998
that?

37:33.248 --> 37:34.349
Well, I don't know. I have to be careful. Not 
necessarily just funding, because we know that's

37:35.730 --> 37:38.393
dead in the water. But what do you think? Use your 
crystal ball. I mean, I've always felt that

37:42.557 --> 37:52.827
we tend to get too greedy. We tend to get a major 
facility and then milk it to death for data. And

38:03.590 --> 38:04.672
we're never satisfied. There's another facility 
we just have to have, another facility we just have

38:04.692 --> 38:08.258
to have. And admittedly, it is a complex area 
because you always need more resolution. You

38:13.087 --> 38:14.730
always need a different wavelength coverage. And 
the problems nowadays are not simply focused in

38:15.251 --> 38:22.264
what you can get out of the ultraviolet data or what 
you can get out of the infrared data. You have to put

38:22.324 --> 38:25.750
the whole thing together in one big 
multi-wavelength picture. And astronomers know

38:26.101 --> 38:31.708
you need 20 telescopes and not just one. And 
Congress wonders, well, jeez, I just gave you one.

38:35.012 --> 38:38.496
Why do you need another one? But is the situation 
healthy? I think that in terms of our ability to do

38:42.882 --> 38:53.395
research, let's say the ability to gather the data 
that we need, the situation is extremely healthy.

38:54.336 --> 38:55.838
The question on an individual basis for an 
individual that an individual exists at a

38:56.138 --> 39:21.370
university or make a career you know there's a 
threat there there's a threat there because the

38:56.138 --> 39:21.370
funding the instruments the instruments are 
there the data is there for the best people the

38:56.138 --> 39:21.370
question about the question is what what about the 
middle the middle pack is there enough funding to

38:56.138 --> 39:21.370
attract the brightest students into the field to 
keep them into the field and so on. And I think the

39:24.926 --> 39:28.091
situation there is of great concern. The number of 
PhDs that are generated is like a factor of three or

39:28.853 --> 39:35.584
four at least, more than the number of real jobs. 
And that's a concern. That's not healthy in the

39:38.669 --> 39:41.133
long term. On the other hand, should there be a 
continuous growth in the number of PhDs that are

39:42.435 --> 39:48.825
created in a field like astronomy, I think we have 
to reach a steady state. Otherwise, there won't be

39:53.573 --> 39:58.940
any archaeologists left, and there won't be any 
new farmers, and so on. I think one indicator of

39:59.341 --> 40:13.659
public interest and the public taxpayer's 
willingness to support, give money to astronomy,

39:59.341 --> 40:13.659
are the fortunes of the Astronomical Society of 
the Pacific. How are those doing now? Well, the

40:15.801 --> 40:17.884
Astronomical Society of the Pacific had great 
success in its programs primarily because it

40:18.083 --> 40:36.961
addresses issues in education that there's a vast 
pool of teachers out there that need help and

40:18.083 --> 40:36.961
information on astronomy and the way to teach it to 
kids and so on. Teachers that have not had any

40:37.021 --> 40:44.428
formal training themselves and sometimes not 
even formal training in science. The ASP has

40:44.813 --> 41:00.493
extremely successful summer meetings that have 
just grown by leaps and bounds in communicating

40:44.813 --> 41:00.493
science in a very popular way and also addressing 
some professional scientific topics as well as

40:44.813 --> 41:00.493
teacher workshops and so on. The problem that the 
ASP has is one that most nonprofit societies face

41:05.114 --> 41:18.950
at one time or another, and that's the bottom line 
in terms of getting the funds it requires just to

41:05.114 --> 41:18.950
keep operating. I mean, it's a small society. Its 
historical base is regional. It's so broad

41:35.624 --> 41:44.074
It has been hard in the recent past to actually 
attract funds, I guess, basically. I mean, in

41:44.134 --> 41:47.638
terms of there's no real strong corporate 
support. Those are some of the goals that I have in

41:49.621 --> 42:04.298
getting strong corporate support and getting the 
programs

41:49.621 --> 42:04.298
underwritten by funding agencies or people that 
are interested in education. and getting more

42:05.054 --> 42:09.060
professional involvement in the society.

42:14.849 --> 42:26.167
Some people join the society and after a year or two 
they realize that they come to the conclusion that

42:14.849 --> 42:26.167
they're not getting enough out of society to 
continue being members. And my answer to them is,

42:26.187 --> 42:29.813
hey listen, the society is made up of you. You maybe 
don't have enough time to go out and talk to your

42:30.350 --> 42:40.841
local school classes or to give a public lecture 
and so on. But as a scientist, as an astronomer, you

42:41.261 --> 42:58.399
should give some strong support and backing to 
those people in the scientific community who are

42:41.261 --> 42:58.399
willing to do the outreach programs that you uh... 
basically are more should be morally obligated to

42:58.683 --> 43:27.711
support because you're getting support from from 
the public so you gotta give something back some

42:58.683 --> 43:27.711
people just don't like to do that so why not you know 
join the society and let the society do it for them

42:58.683 --> 43:27.711
it's strong speak strongly with one voice so uh... 
the society is uh... is in a great uh... state of

42:58.683 --> 43:27.711
change right now in terms of expansion in terms of 
uh... seeking uh... funding support in terms of

43:28.012 --> 43:30.115
the type of programs we want to get into. I have no 
doubt that we'll succeed in all this. This doesn't

43:36.303 --> 43:44.853
have anything to do with the history of planetary 
astronomy, but I've got to ask you, the very name,

43:36.303 --> 43:44.853
Astronomical Society of the Pacific, implies 
regional. You don't want to be just regional

43:45.274 --> 43:46.976
anymore. I'm thinking of changing the name. That 
question was put to me originally when I got

43:50.421 --> 43:56.228
interested in the Society. I looked at it and I 
said, yeah, yeah, you're right. The name is a

43:58.370 --> 44:00.432
detriment. When somebody back in Georgia goes to 
their dean and says they're going to publish a

44:00.593 --> 44:08.422
paper in the PASP, he says, why the PASP? Why not the 
PASA? If there's such a journal. Or if you go to the

44:15.110 --> 44:23.640
University of Florida and say you want to have a 
meeting of the ASP in Florida, they're going to

44:15.110 --> 44:23.640
say, who's the ASP? But You have to remember the 
society is a real venerable society. It's been

44:30.533 --> 44:32.256
around for over 100 years. There's a very strong 
following here on the West Coast and in several of

44:32.757 --> 44:43.355
the states in the U.S. And we even have members from 
70 foreign countries. There are plenty of other

44:44.197 --> 44:48.003
organizations that exist with strange names. It 
just makes it a little bit more of a challenge, a

44:48.624 --> 44:52.170
little more of a challenge challenge to do our I 
don't really feel that it's a time to upset the

44:52.370 --> 45:02.137
apple cart by making a name change. A new director 
and a new name change? No, no, no. We'll exist with

45:05.848 --> 45:07.131
our own name. With our old name.
