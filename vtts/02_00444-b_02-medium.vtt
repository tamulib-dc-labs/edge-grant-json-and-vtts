was from a rather small town background. His 
father was a livestock buyer. He and his wife were

00:10.565 --> 00:14.010
from a ranching background. I was extremely proud 
when he asked me to help him select some cattle to

00:14.070 --> 00:23.382
repopulate his ranch after the drought of the 50s. 
He was a rancher. a very happy experience going

00:26.761 --> 00:34.128
entirely over his ranch with him to praise him, 
advise him about that.

00:37.571 --> 00:42.396
So we had a lot of the same standards and 
characteristics and he was an inspiration to me.

00:47.580 --> 00:55.688
We've covered your early experiences, your 
education here at A&M, your ideas about the Corps,

00:47.580 --> 00:55.688
military, leadership. Is there anything else 
that you would like to talk about with this

00:57.996 --> 01:02.923
interview? Is there anything that I missed that 
you think is important to your life, you think

01:04.706 --> 01:14.059
important to shaping the type of person you are, 
and why you became a general? Well, we haven't said

01:15.161 --> 01:26.637
much about the great support I've had from my wife 
all through the years, or the support and

01:15.161 --> 01:26.637
encouragement and inspiration I've gained from 
my children. I'd have to say that

01:28.017 --> 01:50.042
it sure is easier to achieve if you have a living 
home life, an environment into which you can

01:28.017 --> 01:50.042
effectively sometime retreat, rest, take a 
change of pace. associate with people that you

01:51.642 --> 01:57.930
know are entirely loyal, loving, and supportive. 
So I would have to say that for my immediate family,

01:57.950 --> 02:11.588
for my brother, sister, mother, that I've been 
mighty fortunate in having highly supportive

01:57.950 --> 02:11.588
people. We didn't talk about that a whole lot after 
we left parents, but I certainly have been one of

02:21.933 --> 02:27.410
the Lord's most blessed people in that way.

02:27.430 --> 02:29.517
Now I've got to go to an award ceremony. Okay, thank 
you very much for this interview. Yeah, it's been

02:32.767 --> 02:36.077
fun, an ego trip.
