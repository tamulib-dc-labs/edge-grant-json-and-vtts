00:02.680 --> 00:07.707
Bill Tift at the University of California, 
University of Arizona. Well, he's from the

00:07.727 --> 00:14.237
University of Arizona, but we're currently at the 
Student Union of the University of California.

00:14.317 --> 00:20.025
Okay, so let's get started at the beginning, and 
Bill, for the record, give your full name. William

00:20.045 --> 00:21.147
Grant Tift. And where and when were you born? April 
5th, 1932 in Derby, Connecticut. How did you first

00:28.838 --> 00:31.101
get interested in astronomy? This has to do with 
the history of planetary astronomy. I never

00:36.538 --> 00:37.920
wanted to be anything else. I became interested in 
science or knew I was going to be a scientist about

00:39.481 --> 00:48.529
fourth grade in school in astronomy by the time I 
was in eighth grade. And through a local amateur

00:48.549 --> 01:01.020
astronomer, elderly lady in my hometown, I met 
Dirk Brouwer at Yale.

01:02.570 --> 01:31.480
the next major step well in various amateur 
activities AAVSO things like that Westinghouse

01:02.570 --> 01:31.480
Science Talent Search I was one of the trip winners 
in 1950 to Washington and got to know Harlow

01:02.570 --> 01:31.480
Shapley Harvard was the obvious place to go to get 
undergraduate training and so I went to Harvard as

01:02.570 --> 01:31.480
an undergraduate and you were an astronomy major I 
was an astronomy major which is kind of rare well

01:02.570 --> 01:31.480
there were a number of us several other names that 
are Well, one in planetary astronomy is one of my

01:31.747 --> 01:40.395
roommates was Fred Franklin at CFA. He's, I 
believe, in planetary astronomy. Yes, and I

01:44.038 --> 01:46.980
interviewed him in England. We were roommates at 
Harvard. And Dick Sears, who's known in

01:50.824 --> 01:56.208
astronomy, was one of the... So we had astronomy 
majors in those days. When did you get your

01:58.390 --> 02:00.252
bachelor's degree? 1954. Okay, and then where'd 
you go to grad school? Caltech. Why did you pick

02:04.859 --> 02:05.780
Caltech? Because astronomy was disintegrating 
at Harvard. That was when Bach left Harvard and it

02:09.143 --> 02:18.311
switched from an observational institution in 
the Shapley Revolution. When Shapley resigned

02:19.272 --> 02:29.682
and the Southern Hemisphere Observatory was 
potentially being closed and things like that, it

02:19.272 --> 02:29.682
was not a time to go on in observational astronomy 
and Caltech was the obvious place where

02:30.168 --> 02:36.516
first-rate observational astronomy was being 
done. So I went to Caltech. And

02:40.020 --> 02:46.348
what was your thesis and who was your thesis 
advisor for your PhD? OK. My thesis was on the

02:46.969 --> 02:58.403
photometry of the nuclei, nuclear regions of 
galaxies, well, photometry of galaxies on an

02:46.969 --> 02:58.403
eight-color system. My advisor was Art Code.

03:03.972 --> 03:15.248
He was at Caltech at that time and then

03:03.972 --> 03:15.248
later left Caltech. I guess he went back to 
Wisconsin as director at that time. Bill Baum was

03:20.134 --> 03:24.340
my other sort of advisor. I say sort of advisor 
because I actually saw art code only twice during

03:24.843 --> 03:31.690
my thesis, the beginning and at one intermediate 
point. I had one discussion with Bill Baum.

03:34.272 --> 03:35.894
Otherwise, I pretty much did it myself. When did 
you get your PhD? 1958. Okay, and what did you do

03:40.758 --> 03:42.500
then? I went as a postdoc to Australia to work on 
Magellanic Cloud problems. With Bach? Well, Bach

03:50.864 --> 03:55.270
was director then, and it was through Bach that I 
made the arrangements. But again, it was a program

03:55.751 --> 03:58.454
I designed myself. I wasn't working specifically 
with anyone. Okay, now, so when did you leave

04:01.638 --> 04:04.102
Australia? Okay, Australia, I was a two-year 
National Science Foundation postdoc. I left

04:11.992 --> 04:19.943
there in 1959

04:11.992 --> 04:19.943
and finished the last few months of the postdoc 
at... Caltech, and then I had arranged a job in

04:20.294 --> 04:39.665
Nashville

04:20.294 --> 04:39.665
with Carl Seifert at the University of, well, at 
Vanderbilt University, Dyer Observatory.

04:41.187 --> 04:45.995
Unfortunately, Carl Seifert had been killed in an 
automobile accident. As a matter of fact, it was It

04:47.918 --> 04:52.363
happened an hour before I arrived in Nashville for 
my first visit. I was met by a graduate student, in

04:53.565 --> 05:02.976
fact, Charles Tolbert, well-known in astronomy, 
who told me that Carol had just been killed in an

04:53.565 --> 05:02.976
automobile accident. I went to Seaford's 
funeral.

05:08.822 --> 05:14.449
But that changed what was to be a three-year 
appointment working in high-latitude blue stars

05:15.307 --> 05:31.102
to a one-year appointment, immediately looking 
for a job, which is when, well, I had previously met

05:15.307 --> 05:31.102
John Hall and was interested in possibilities at 
Lowell, and so I immediately picked up that

05:15.307 --> 05:31.102
thread. And since Harold Johnson had just left 
Lowell and they had just acquired the Ohio State

05:32.543 --> 05:41.972
69-inch telescope, And I had the kind of 
credentials both in photometry and experience

05:42.357 --> 05:48.688
with large telescopes. So basically I was offered 
Errol Johnson's job at Lowell. So I was actually at

05:54.037 --> 05:56.381
Vanderbilt then only for one year. Okay, when you 
got to Lowell, what was the place like?

06:04.936 --> 06:11.624
Well, it's a beautiful place to live and a 
beautiful place to enjoy yourself. Perhaps one of

06:12.065 --> 06:17.552
the most wonderful settings and pleasant places 
to live. But I think the one thing which is most

06:18.433 --> 06:27.965
obvious about Lowell, was obvious then, was the 
extremely tight budget under which they

06:18.433 --> 06:27.965
operated. The question of the controls of the 
Lowell estate and a fairly small section, a

06:32.729 --> 06:39.501
portion of which was devoted to maintaining the 
observatory. And although I don't know many of the

06:40.924 --> 06:56.391
details, I know there was a lot of concern about 
whether any of the additional estate money would

06:40.924 --> 06:56.391
become available to astronomy.

06:57.265 --> 07:12.085
I never really went into any discussions on this, 
but there was a lot of concern as to how you could

06:57.265 --> 07:12.085
operate an effective modern observatory on the 
extremely small amounts of money which were

06:57.265 --> 07:12.085
available. You mentioned yesterday that early on 
in the space program, when it was about time you

07:14.287 --> 07:26.884
were getting involved, the powers that be or 
whoever decided that they really didn't want to

07:14.287 --> 07:26.884
get involved with the space program because it 
didn't have the base on which to do it, which is kind

07:27.067 --> 07:32.575
of surprising in that later that they did get the 
Planetary Data Center and everything. Could you

07:32.595 --> 07:33.917
say that for the record? Well,

07:33.937 --> 07:44.152
for various reasons, part of them personal in my 
own life, I was going through approaching divorce

07:33.937 --> 07:44.152
and so on. It was a certain feeling on my part that I 
needed some change. The space program was

07:48.578 --> 07:53.445
developing, and I wrote a letter at one point to the 
Institute for of Astrophysics, or whatever it is,

07:53.662 --> 08:18.454
the NASA Institute in New York City, I believe, and 
expressing interest in space astronomy, and was

07:53.662 --> 08:18.454
referred to Jocelyn Gill and, I forget his first 
name, Foster's division in NASA on manned space

07:53.662 --> 08:18.454
astronomy, and They invited me back to Washington 
for a while. I went back as a consultant for a couple

08:21.430 --> 08:23.513
of months. What year was this, roughly? It had been 
around 19... Well, I went to Lowell in 61. Probably

08:29.081 --> 08:34.468
the original correspondence here was in 62, 
possibly as late as 63. When I came back from

08:35.630 --> 08:44.281
Washington, I was quite interested in the space 
program and potentially interested in applying

08:35.630 --> 08:44.281
to the astronaut program. In fact, I did apply 
later in 1965. But... I remember having

08:49.636 --> 09:09.425
discussions with John Hall and expressing my 
interest in the space program and getting this

08:49.636 --> 09:09.425
feedback or concern that, well, this really was 
not the kind of direction that they felt that they

08:49.636 --> 09:09.425
could support the program. That if I was 
interested in going into this, that perhaps this

09:09.465 --> 09:15.795
wasn't the proper base to operate from. And of 
course, they had hired me. in a completely

09:18.610 --> 09:32.827
different context, basically, to use, I mean, to 
do photometry with some of the large, their newer

09:18.610 --> 09:32.827
large telescope, well, the 6090s. Not that it was 
that great a telescope, because it wasn't at that

09:32.867 --> 09:39.716
time, until they redid it a few years later. And 
made it into a, what, a 72-inch? 72-inch, with a

09:41.618 --> 09:43.600
quality mirror. I spent a lot of time Well, there 
were two problems. One, the 69-inch was not a

09:46.934 --> 09:49.357
high-quality telescope. You couldn't do imagery 
with it. The images tended to distort rapidly as a

09:55.445 --> 09:59.891
function of temperature changes. I remember 
doing a lot of installation work on the telescope,

10:00.792 --> 10:05.539
trying to control the figure on the mirror. And 
also, because of the very low budgets at Lolo, they

10:06.320 --> 10:12.127
had very little instrumentation. There was no 
equipment, really, to go with it. One reason they

10:14.534 --> 10:19.578
had hired me was I did have my own part of my own 
photometer. Harold Johnson had taken all the

10:20.079 --> 10:29.767
equipment with him when he left, and there really 
was no working equipment. I got a small O&R grant

10:29.787 --> 10:42.098
with which I built up a working photometer and did 
use the 69-inch to extend the work that I had done as

10:29.787 --> 10:42.098
my dissertation. That was my main new scientific 
research that I did at Lowell. But in parallel, I

10:48.028 --> 10:51.972
was developing this interest in the space 
program. And it was that aspect that,

10:51.992 --> 11:09.450
well, John Lowell specifically was a little 
apprehensive about whether this was an

10:51.992 --> 11:09.450
appropriate type of development that Lowell 
wanted to support. Let me just get something in for

11:10.171 --> 11:11.793
the record. When did you leave Lowell? 1964, 
essentially. Initially, it was halftime, I

11:17.714 --> 11:23.282
think, from July to October of 64. I was halftime at 
Lowell and halftime at Arizona. And then in

11:27.508 --> 11:31.053
October of 64, I was full-time at Arizona. Where 
you have been since then. Where I've been there

11:32.695 --> 11:34.257
since then, that's correct. I went there as 
associate professor and was promoted to full

11:34.277 --> 11:41.427
professor in 1973.

11:41.947 --> 11:43.970
when you were at Lowell. Now, Lowell's, of course, 
famous to the public for its planetary and

11:45.252 --> 11:59.493
particularly Mars studies, but of course they 
always did, right from the very beginning, a lot of

11:45.252 --> 11:59.493
stellar and galactic work, for which, of course, 
they didn't get the credit that they deserved. But

12:00.595 --> 12:10.249
when you were there, what was the attitude towards 
planetary versus stellar and galactic and

12:00.595 --> 12:10.249
extragalactic work? Well, there was a strong 
support, I think, or a feeling that the work that

12:10.448 --> 12:28.553
Harold had done and the study of star clusters, 
there wasn't much experience there in galaxies,

12:10.448 --> 12:28.553
although I remember having discussions with some 
of the U.S. Naval Observatory people. There had

12:29.874 --> 12:37.705
been some interesting work that had been done by,

12:29.874 --> 12:37.705
hmm, what was his name? some multicolor 
photography or multicolor imagery that had been

12:38.495 --> 12:44.862
done on galaxies at Naval Observatory. I think 
they were quite enthusiastic, actually, about

12:46.284 --> 12:51.670
the work that I was doing on galaxy photometry. It 
fit rather nicely into the kind of things that

12:51.730 --> 12:58.537
Harold had been initially exploring. I'd also 
done work in star clusters and things, so I had a lot

12:59.038 --> 13:06.426
in common in principle with the kinds of things 
that Harold Johnson had been doing. And I think

13:06.760 --> 13:09.403
they were very enthusiastic about that kind of 
work. I encountered

13:10.224 --> 13:27.585
very little feeling that Lowell had a planetary 
orientation, or there certainly was no pressure

13:10.224 --> 13:27.585
in any sense to be doing anything that was 
connected with planetary work. I think they

13:27.625 --> 13:36.396
considered their work potentially quite 
broad-based.

13:37.456 --> 13:55.659
One of the very visible programs there was Henry 
Giklis' work on proper motions of red faint stars,

13:37.456 --> 13:55.659
and I actually was considering some observations 
of some of the proper motion stars. I'd say it was a

13:56.300 --> 14:03.008
fairly broad-based program, stellar, 
extragalactic, and obviously planetary, but

13:56.300 --> 14:03.008
that wasn't an aspect that I had much connection. 
Did you ever feel that you were considered by real

14:03.038 --> 14:10.650
astronomers to be second rate because you were at 
Lowell instead of, say, Mount Holson? No, I didn't

14:10.670 --> 14:12.273
have that feeling at all. I thought Lowell was a 
highly respected observatory. It was recognized

14:15.758 --> 14:19.464
that they had budgetary or monetary problems. 
But, for example, my request for an O&R grant was

14:21.928 --> 14:28.438
very well received. And Lowell, I think, was a very 
respected observatory. And the people that were

14:32.281 --> 14:37.748
there, not that there weren't very many of us, but 
Bill Sinton was well-known. And, of course,

14:38.208 --> 14:43.535
Harold Johnson had been extremely well-known. It 
was a small group, but I think my general

14:44.076 --> 14:50.503
impression was highly regarded. Now, you overlap 
with some of the real old-timers there, and that's

14:51.925 --> 14:57.913
what I want to hit you for. Yeah, yeah. Of

14:58.642 --> 15:13.358
the Slipher brothers, I knew EC moderately. That 
is, I met him a couple of times, had a few

15:13.438 --> 15:16.742
discussions with him. Vesto, I saw a few times. He 
was not around the observatory very much. And that

15:26.485 --> 15:31.312
was really before I got into my modern work in 
galaxies. In a way, I wish I'd had a chance to have

15:31.332 --> 15:38.363
actually talked to some of them about some of the 
early redshift work that they did. I never

15:38.443 --> 15:40.666
actually had any direct contact on that. For the 
record, of the two brothers, E.C. was the one who

15:44.472 --> 15:45.634
did what? The two Slipher brothers. Well, again, 
you probably know. I mean, I don't know the

15:52.063 --> 15:53.526
history. Which one was the Mars guy? Well, I assume 
EC was more of the planetary oriented, and Vesto a

15:55.696 --> 16:02.530
little more. Well, I know Vesto, I believe, was the 
one who did the

16:03.371 --> 16:11.207
actual ridge observations. interesting in that 
if you go back into elementary textbooks of 10 or 20

16:11.542 --> 16:22.257
years ago, it's always Hubble, Hubble, Hubble, 
and now people have been getting their act

16:11.542 --> 16:22.257
together, and they note that it was really Slipher 
that did it. Slipher did the actual first

16:22.277 --> 16:24.239
observations. That's correct. Slipher was the 
one who made the observations, though I believe

16:25.201 --> 16:32.451
it's fair to say it was Hubble that recognized the 
significance. And I don't really know what the

16:32.471 --> 16:35.695
communication chains were between... I mean, 
they obviously knew each other, and I think it...

16:42.372 --> 16:51.100
Any material or information that was collected by 
Schleifer became known and was used, at least as a

16:42.372 --> 16:51.100
starting point, for Hubble. What exactly how it 
influenced Hubble's beginning, I have really no

16:51.140 --> 16:55.083
idea. But it puzzles me in a way, and that's why I 
wish I had known at the time what I was going to be

16:56.204 --> 17:12.058
doing later, because it would have been very 
interesting to talk to the Schleifer brothers

16:56.204 --> 17:12.058
about what were their original motivations for 
doing this, and what were their impressions.

17:12.410 --> 17:14.453
Unfortunately, I have no idea. They obviously 
didn't pursue it or follow it up the way Hubble did.

17:21.982 --> 17:29.432
So whether they considered it just a curiosity or 
whether they really thought deeply about what

17:21.982 --> 17:29.432
this might mean, I don't know. But they preceded 
the knowledge of what they were looking at. And I

17:34.558 --> 17:42.028
believe part of the original motivation for their 
observations were undoubtedly the idea that

17:34.558 --> 17:42.028
perhaps galaxies were We've seen this in the 
literature, but again, I don't have it as a direct

17:42.683 --> 17:46.767
statement for this life. Galaxies were 
considered as possible solar systems in

17:47.587 --> 17:53.773
formation. That was one of the old concepts. Did 
you ever meet Lamplin? No. Because there was a lot

18:00.319 --> 18:05.023
of radiometry that went on in the 20s and 30s. I knew 
Edison Pettit, but that was back through... In

18:08.106 --> 18:12.150
fact, Edison Pettit was the man who built the 
photometer that I took to Australia. or built the

18:12.586 --> 18:15.329
cold box, to my specifications. But he was the only 
really old...

18:22.036 --> 18:31.986
I guess he was retired from Mount Wilson, but he was 
still running his machine shop in Pasadena, and I

18:22.036 --> 18:31.986
was referred to him and made arrangements for him 
to build my photometer. But again, I never had any

18:32.427 --> 18:36.571
in-depth conversations with these people. I've 
heard various stories about how the old work was

18:37.512 --> 18:42.357
done, but... Well, let's hear an old story. Well, 
like the first observations of photometry on the

18:43.012 --> 19:12.630
100-inch telescope when they used a ballistic 
galvanometer as the operating across the 10-foot

18:43.012 --> 19:12.630
width of the Newtonian platform on the 100-inch 
telescope to get the first photometric

18:43.012 --> 19:12.630
deflections that were used in some of the early 
galaxy photometry that people like Pettit and

18:43.012 --> 19:12.630
Stevens and Whitford and so on were doing. at 
Lowell when you were there, what did the people on

19:12.830 --> 19:17.375
the staff think of Percival Lowell?

19:20.758 --> 19:30.608
Well, I had the impression that he was a very highly 
respected founder of the observatory. I never

19:30.648 --> 19:31.949
heard anything negative. And the old library 
there, the tours that they held, his founding of

19:33.350 --> 19:41.959
the observatory, his original connection with 
Mars and so on was always very highly regarded, as

19:42.395 --> 19:48.384
far as I could tell. I was never directly, I'd say, 
involved in any of this. I never remember any

19:52.831 --> 19:57.519
conversations relating to Lowell. I had a number 
of conversations with the,

19:57.559 --> 20:09.297
what's

19:57.559 --> 20:09.297
the man who administered the estate? executor, 
not executor, but... Sole trustee or something,

20:12.420 --> 20:14.702
wasn't it? Sole trustee, yes. Was his nephew or 
something like that? Yes, his nephew. Roger

20:19.346 --> 20:30.898
Lowell Putnam was the trustee, and I remember 
going for a hike up Mount Humphreys. We didn't get

20:31.238 --> 20:35.602
to the top, but I remember I went on a hike with him. 
Again, the main theme that came through was...

20:40.462 --> 20:41.263
Lack of money. I never detected anything but 
enthusiasm for doing the best astronomy we can at

20:41.283 --> 20:51.640
this institution, but we don't have much money. 
How did the townsfolk treat the observatory and

20:51.700 --> 20:57.950
the astronomers there? My impression, again, was 
that this was a highly respected institution and

21:05.453 --> 21:15.284
Again, I never detected any animosity or any 
feeling that this

21:05.453 --> 21:15.284
was anything but a real nice thing to have in town. 
And it was a standard viewing place. People would

21:18.147 --> 21:24.774
drive up the drive, and it was always considered 
one of the best places to look over the surrounding

21:18.147 --> 21:24.774
area. Mars Hill was certainly a local 
institution. I just flew over it Saturday, and

21:27.577 --> 21:30.500
there was a hole in the clouds. The only one between 
I think San Antonio and San Francisco, and there

21:32.538 --> 21:39.288
was Flagstaff, and there was Mars Hill with the 
little white domes on top. Of course, Anderson

21:39.308 --> 21:51.385
Mesa development had just started, and there were 
a couple of... Well, there was, I guess... There

21:51.425 --> 21:58.495
was a telescope down there, and I can't remember 
the exact sequence in which these were moved or

21:51.425 --> 21:58.495
built, which was the one connected with the... 
lunar mapping program which was going on there.

22:03.502 --> 22:05.886
And that was being done by, what, the Air Force? 
That was the Air Force. It was an Air Force program

22:07.168 --> 22:23.875
and it was specifically oriented towards

22:07.168 --> 22:23.875
preparing best maps of the moon for the moon 
landings, future moon landings. USGS, I guess it

22:24.462 --> 22:33.410
was, and Gene Shoemaker's program, they were in 
Flagstaff around that time. They were located on

22:33.450 --> 22:36.533
the north side of town, a different location. 
Yeah, I knew Gene Shoemaker, or got to know him

22:37.194 --> 22:50.387
later, because we were both astronaut candidates 
in 1965, but again, I had no direct connection,

22:37.194 --> 22:50.387
just these were interesting programs which were 
going on in the area. There was interest in

22:52.407 --> 22:54.990
specifically the preparation for the moon 
landing. I didn't associate any of this work with

22:55.051 --> 23:01.639
any of the other aspects or any other parts of the 
solar system. It was all very much moon-oriented.

23:04.664 --> 23:20.625
Now, I want to take you to Arizona and then your 
involvement with NASA because the title of this

23:04.664 --> 23:20.625
book, God Willing the Creek Don't Rise, it gets 
printed, is Phoenix, NASA and the Rebirth of

23:04.664 --> 23:20.625
Planetary Astronomy. And you did have a strong 
connection with NASA, which is how I first got to

23:20.960 --> 23:26.627
meet you. When did this start? Well, I'd say it 
started with this letter to NASA Space Science

23:29.611 --> 23:48.435
Institute in New York City, and then was referred 
to Jocelyn Gill, OSS, that branch of OSSA,

23:49.192 --> 23:55.843
Because I was interested in the space program, and 
I wanted to find out, well, was there any way of

23:49.192 --> 23:55.843
getting more closely involved in it? That's why 
Jocelyn Gill then invited me to come to

23:55.983 --> 24:11.669
Washington, be a consultant in her office, 
specifically preparing some training manuals or

23:55.983 --> 24:11.669
answering questions for the astronauts. I 
remember writing a little paper for Jocelyn on...

24:16.529 --> 24:31.145
meteors as a little information paper for the to go 
to the then Mercury and I guess by then Gemini

24:16.529 --> 24:31.145
astronauts.

24:31.385 --> 24:43.498
Out of this meeting with our original contacts 
with Jocelyn and I don't remember the details I was

24:31.385 --> 24:43.498
and I'd always kind of expressed interest in the 
lunar program I was referred to a

24:44.170 --> 24:52.543
conference that was being held in Chicago. At 
O'Hare Airport. At O'Hare Airport. And I was the

24:54.366 --> 24:56.329
guy that arranged it and chaired it. Right. It was 
on the military orbiting laboratory. And at this

24:59.654 --> 25:11.292
time, there were discussions about merging the 
Air Force Orbiting Laboratory Program and NASA's

24:59.654 --> 25:11.292
plans for orbiting laboratories. And this was 
called the MOL conference or something. And I

25:15.777 --> 25:22.245
don't remember exactly how I got invited to it, but 
I'm sure it was in one way connected with out of

25:15.777 --> 25:22.245
Jocelyn Gill's office. That's where the size of 
the original space telescope, which is now called

25:22.265 --> 25:31.556
Live Space Telescope, got to be 120 inches because 
Aidan Meinel was there. And I asked him, what's the

25:31.596 --> 25:35.060
biggest diffraction thing we could have in 10 
years? And he said 120 inches. It was at that

25:36.381 --> 25:41.427
meeting that I came in knowing very little about 
what was going on. I, of course, had heard of the Air

25:41.568 --> 25:44.451
Force program And I knew there were general 
long-range plans on the part of NASA. And it

25:52.013 --> 26:02.829
was at that meeting that basically I met Aiden 
Meinel, who recognized my interest. And it was

26:03.831 --> 26:07.356
then, I believe, was Harlan Smith at that meeting? 
Yes. Both Harlan Smith and Aiden Meinel were at

26:08.438 --> 26:12.784
that meeting. recognized this as a potential 
field of development, apparently recognized me

26:13.051 --> 26:21.043
as somebody who was interested in working in it. 
And I got job offers very shortly from both Aden to

26:21.504 --> 26:28.936
come to Arizona and from Harlan to come to Texas. 
And

26:30.298 --> 26:38.130
to basically begin developing manned space 
science programs to help them in developing that

26:38.583 --> 26:45.230
kind of program. And I like the atmosphere at 
Arizona, particularly when I visited one right

26:46.171 --> 26:57.364
after the other and accepted Aidan's offer to, 
again, I hated to leave Lowell. It was a beautiful

26:57.384 --> 27:05.513
place and I was doing good work in galaxy 
photometry, but I say I needed a change for several

26:57.384 --> 27:05.513
reasons. One was personal with my coming divorce. 
I was divorced in 1964 with custody of two children

27:08.395 --> 27:18.810
and then aged two and a half and three and a half. I 
needed a change and I was very interested in the

27:18.970 --> 27:24.558
space program and said, well, this is a good time to 
go do something else. Hayden offered an

27:24.999 --> 27:30.587
atmosphere and he's a remarkable person. So, of 
course, was Harlan, but I learned photometry from

27:34.928 --> 27:41.096
Harlan at Harvard, which was where I learned how to 
do photoelectric photometry. But Arizona

27:41.116 --> 27:44.660
offered the opportunity. The new space sciences 
building had just been completed. The section was

27:47.303 --> 27:55.013
dedicated to space astronomy that I helped to lay 
out and built up. Well, we obtained a NASA grant,

27:55.834 --> 28:03.163
initial grant, I guess, I'm not sure whether I'd 
have to go back and look at the papers, exactly how

28:03.582 --> 28:11.474
my name and Aidan's name were combined. His 
philosophy was he would run the classified

28:11.895 --> 28:21.609
military side of things, and I would handle the 
NASA civilian side. What was NASA giving you the

28:21.629 --> 28:23.753
money to do? Initially, it was experiment or 
possible design. I think our original proposal

28:30.563 --> 28:32.526
was a telescope that would float beside Gemini or 
be carried on Gemini spacecraft and be operated

28:32.877 --> 28:43.468
possibly remotely, maybe connected to it. We 
wanted to investigate the possibility of

28:43.528 --> 28:53.098
carrying a small telescope attached or slightly 
detached from Gemini and operated in real time.

28:53.639 --> 29:01.247
This then later led to the development of, well, I 
had two fundamental programs that I worked on.

29:02.408 --> 29:10.421
three actually, that were funded some out of NASA 
headquarters and some later out of Marshall Space

29:02.408 --> 29:10.421
Flight Center. One was to develop a ultraviolet 
camera that would operate on a stable platform,

29:11.362 --> 29:22.960
stabilized platform, for ultraviolet 
photography with film recovery. The idea was to

29:23.020 --> 29:27.167
bring back a as complete a survey of the sky in the UV 
as possible. We were developing reflecting

29:34.432 --> 29:49.792
filter, interference filter type coatings, and 
design of a very compact aspheric system for wide

29:34.432 --> 29:49.792
field imaging. And the idea was to do a sky survey, 
photographic, and bring back the film. That was

29:54.999 --> 29:56.901
one of our key programs. Here's one thing I've got 
written down, and I want to ask you before I forget

29:57.353 --> 30:00.598
it. In your opinion, what's NASA like today 
compared to what it was in the early 60s? Well, if it

30:08.570 --> 30:11.494
was like it was in the early 60s, I would probably 
still be in it. What's changed? Well, as our

30:16.222 --> 30:25.015
programs developed, as we got further into 
experiment development and possibilities, It

30:25.332 --> 30:36.753
became clear that there was, and you'll find this 
in my discussion with Joe Terowitz, that there was

30:25.332 --> 30:36.753
an intense conflict between the manned and the 
unmanned side of NASA. And I was interested in the

30:38.156 --> 30:42.343
manned side. I felt that man had a role in space. I 
was also strongly oriented toward the lunar

30:44.627 --> 30:47.172
program. and felt that we should get a base on the 
moon as soon as possible and begin to develop some

30:48.265 --> 30:55.416
self-sufficient. I thought the long range in 
astronomy really should be founded on the moon.

31:01.466 --> 31:15.488
But

31:01.466 --> 31:15.488
what I saw progressively happening was a lot of, 
well, I was being lost in this battle between

31:01.466 --> 31:15.488
manned and unmanned astronomy.

31:16.953 --> 31:25.187
Ultimately, when the things like the Vietnam War 
developed and so on, everything seemed to be

31:16.953 --> 31:25.187
turning downhill. I didn't see... We didn't get 
our mission, for example. We would have flown on

31:28.593 --> 31:31.397
Skylab 2. There had been a Skylab 2, but it was cut 
off. We saw the follow-on OIO programs being cut

31:33.942 --> 31:37.688
back. And it looked like, well... Yes, one could 
hang on in the field, but the future really didn't

31:42.907 --> 31:49.835
look very bright, and especially looked very 
bright for manned astronomy. So I basically,

31:50.516 --> 32:02.449
after spending quite a bit of NASA money, simply 
decided that that wasn't a profitable field to

31:50.516 --> 32:02.449
work in. I was on the original planning group for 
the Large Space Telescope. I was a member of the

32:05.533 --> 32:10.939
Woods Hole study group that led to the... led to the 
planning for HST. But it was a long way downstream.

32:17.848 --> 32:20.272
And I didn't see much opportunity in the interim 
period. When you were getting NASA money, how did

32:20.873 --> 32:25.960
headquarters handle you? Did they micromanage? 
Do you think they knew what you were doing? Well,

32:29.665 --> 32:30.587
they knew what I was doing. But I was supported for 
funny reasons. I was in the manned space program.

32:36.620 --> 32:43.908
And I had very strong connections with 
particularly people at Marshall Space Flight

32:36.620 --> 32:43.908
Center. They were interested in developing

32:44.028 --> 32:51.556
basically packages for some of their large 
rockets. They were interested in basically the

32:51.676 --> 32:57.823
origin of the Skylab program, and they wanted 
packages to put on them. They weren't getting

32:58.183 --> 33:01.927
cooperation from NASA headquarters.

33:04.470 --> 33:06.492
But I was well enough supported that that there was 
a feeling at headquarters that they had better

33:07.417 --> 33:15.748
support me, had better fund me, so that they would 
have some control over what was going on. I

33:16.349 --> 33:26.643
received money from Nancy Roman's office, not 
because my programs were especially favored by

33:16.349 --> 33:26.643
them, but so that they could retain some control of 
what I was doing. And instead of being funded

33:26.663 --> 33:37.238
entirely out of Marshall Space Flight Center, 
which is where about half of my money came from,

33:26.663 --> 33:37.238
there was a lot of... That's what I mean by this 
conflict between... the headquarters and the

33:37.825 --> 33:45.498
stations, this was very apparent in the work that I 
was doing. It did play a role in the way I was funded.

33:55.855 --> 34:01.825
Do you think that astronomers in general do a good 
job of selling themselves to the public?

34:04.589 --> 34:08.895
And this includes planetary astronomy because I 
assume that that's part of astronomy. Well, I

34:09.576 --> 34:13.881
think people have become much more aware of this 
now than they were in the past. I think in the past,

34:13.941 --> 34:25.136
the astronomy has barely been pretty naive in 
assuming that just the fact that it's good

34:13.941 --> 34:25.136
academic science should be sufficient. So 
basically, I know, I don't think astronomers have

34:25.777 --> 34:30.884
done a very good job of selling themselves to the 
public. And it takes a lot of time to do it. And the

34:34.964 --> 34:40.911
problem is, we'll say, the kind of work that I do.

34:44.015 --> 34:45.937
We work as an individual scientist. You don't have 
a lot of support, particularly if you do

34:45.957 --> 34:55.428
controversial science like I do, with no support, 
or practically no support. You don't have time to

34:55.509 --> 35:01.275
spend a lot of time doing the popularizing. What 
you need is a large enough base and the kind of

35:03.567 --> 35:08.153
support that you can have a public relations 
person. You need the kind of people around you who

35:08.513 --> 35:14.381
can provide the interface. And that's an area we 
have not seen, I don't think, well enough

35:14.641 --> 35:18.747
supported. Scientists have got to be given enough 
support that they can have some PR people who know

35:19.287 --> 35:26.717
how to construct this interface. Because most of 
us don't have the time to do it ourselves, nor the

35:27.117 --> 35:30.722
knowledge. do it ourselves to do the proper kind of 
interface and so i think there's been a lot of very

35:31.192 --> 35:52.575
naive scientists who think that all they've got to 
say is well i mean everybody knows good science

35:31.192 --> 35:52.575
should be done that should be sufficient it isn't 
sufficient you've got to popularize it you've got

35:31.192 --> 35:52.575
to present it in a way that uh you'll be the public 
would be more enthusiastic about. Very few

35:55.412 --> 35:57.014
scientists know how to do that. Of course, if you go 
way back, you know, to the turn of the century,

35:58.035 --> 36:04.781
there were some really great promoters around in 
astronomy, George Orwell. Now, that all seemed to

36:04.801 --> 36:11.287
die, and what I always call the Mount Wilson, the 
public be damned attitude took over. Yes, I would

36:11.687 --> 36:20.976
agree very much with that, and we have seen the 
basic, well, it's often called the Mount Wilson or

36:11.687 --> 36:20.976
Caltech, Princeton Access

36:21.260 --> 36:36.038
developed, and one had a feeling that, well, if 
they thought something should be done, that

36:21.260 --> 36:36.038
supposedly was all that was necessary. And there

36:36.058 --> 36:41.885
were plenty of us out there who didn't agree with 
that philosophy. I mean, Aidan Meinl and I were a

36:41.905 --> 36:49.714
good example of who felt that we could have done a 
lot more science in the man space program. than, in

36:50.437 --> 36:59.326
fact, we ever got a chance to do because

36:50.437 --> 36:59.326
the decisions had been made that it was to be done 
one particular way. And the manned space program,

36:59.587 --> 37:04.011
well, give us your money. We don't really care 
about this program. Just give us the money and

37:06.454 --> 37:08.536
we'll go ahead and do the astronomy. Do you think 
that attitude is changing now?

37:15.844 --> 37:16.705
Not entirely. I mean, we still see the same... 
fundamental disagreement that astronomy

37:20.153 --> 37:34.526
divides into, or science divides into those who 
are willing to work with the manned program and

37:20.153 --> 37:34.526
those who just want unmanned spacecraft. And 
there's a role for both. I've always felt, and I

37:37.789 --> 37:49.620
think that the public in many respects is more 
enthusiastic, or there's a lot of enthusiasm

37:37.789 --> 37:49.620
still for manned space-type activity. And I don't 
think that resource was ever properly supported

37:50.917 --> 37:58.809
by science, that approach. I can't interview any 
of the participants in this, so I'm asking

37:59.070 --> 38:04.298
everybody that might have an opinion. What do you 
think killed planetary astronomy in the early

38:04.999 --> 38:08.164
part of this century?

38:11.128 --> 38:11.549
Killed it? I don't think it was ever killed. Sure, 
there was some stuff being done in the 20s and 30s,

38:14.794 --> 38:17.498
but But planetary astronomy was a big part of 
astronomy at the turn of the century, and then by

38:17.933 --> 38:23.640
the time you get to the 1920s, it's not. Oh, well, 
okay. I mean, there was a big shift in interest

38:25.443 --> 38:35.796
because the capabilities came along and the 
knowledge came along to explore stellar

38:25.443 --> 38:35.796
astronomy and then extra-galactic astronomy. I 
mean, there's always a tendency to move,

38:35.816 --> 38:41.083
certainly, or I feel, to move where the frontier 
is. And the frontier is usually near the limits of

38:42.084 --> 38:46.590
detection And when the planets are bright and easy 
to look at. And I think a lot of the reason that

38:54.750 --> 39:03.880
people turned back to planetary astronomy, 
though, was when the close planetary flybys

38:54.750 --> 39:03.880
started coming along. And people suddenly 
realized how much more detail and interest or

39:04.541 --> 39:14.232
interesting subjects there were that that It is 
the space program itself that swung the interest

39:14.566 --> 39:23.295
back in the direction of planetary astronomy, 
because it became clear that so much more could, in

39:14.566 --> 39:23.295
fact, be done. And then we had the new generations 
of detectors. And it's kind of interesting. I

39:27.980 --> 39:35.268
think you see these new techniques being focused 
on very nearby things, like the solar system, and

39:27.980 --> 39:35.268
very distant things. And there's a gap now. The gap 
is now in between, where, for example, we're

39:37.070 --> 39:44.438
looking at very distant galaxies and ignoring the 
nearby ones. except for distance scale

39:45.008 --> 39:48.113
calibrations and so on. We're making the 
assumption, again, that we understand the nearby

39:48.133 --> 39:54.302
thing, and I disagree very strongly on that. The 
nearby galaxies are, I think, harbor some very

39:54.422 --> 40:11.768
interesting...

39:54.422 --> 40:11.768
Well, my own work on the Ritchie equation, of 
course, is directly relevant there, but you see

39:54.422 --> 40:11.768
this leapfrogging technique... From z equals 
zero to z equals five. ...re-focus your attention

40:11.869 --> 40:14.172
on the nearby things. I think the space program did 
that. The primitive early investigations,

40:16.789 --> 40:28.125
beginning as early as, say, the Ranger 
spacecraft, which focused attention again on the

40:16.789 --> 40:28.125
detailed surface of the Moon, or the properties of 
the surface of the Moon. You see that once a

40:28.726 --> 40:39.602
spacecraft had studied the Jupiter system, and 
now a lot of interesting ground-based

40:28.726 --> 40:39.602
observations of the of the satellites, of the 
studies of EO and so on, was refocused by the space

40:39.987 --> 40:46.998
program. I don't think the astronomers 
themselves would have ever, by themselves, would

40:48.019 --> 40:59.937
have ever gotten as enthusiastic about the solar 
system if it hadn't been for the space program.

41:00.980 --> 41:09.368
Recently, so you think that NASA money, really, 
for probes and supporting ground-based

41:00.980 --> 41:09.368
astronomy really brought back planetary 
astronomy? Yes, I think I feel that very strongly.

41:11.209 --> 41:16.994
I don't think it was the astronomers themselves, 
even given the detectors. Well, some, I'm sure,

41:17.335 --> 41:28.725
would have looked at the planets, but it was the 
excitement generated by the space program that

41:17.335 --> 41:28.725
brought, well, probably a lot of people had been 
trained or trained their job opportunities were

41:29.144 --> 41:34.689
conditional upon the availability of space 
money. The number of astronomers trained was

41:34.769 --> 41:43.037
increased considerably because of the space 
program. Recently, a lot of people have been

41:43.117 --> 41:56.350
getting a lot of publicity, and evidently money, 
by working on topics such as search for

41:43.117 --> 41:56.350
extraterrestrial intelligence, other solar 
search for other solar systems uh the ozone hole uh

41:56.549 --> 42:23.923
on the earth's atmosphere and killer comets and 
asteroids you think they're overdoing it well i

41:56.549 --> 42:23.923
think these are all valid fields of investigation 
and i think the reason why some of these are

41:56.549 --> 42:23.923
emphasized or why the focus is there is because 
they are programs which you can popularize now i

41:56.549 --> 42:23.923
don't think that's that should be the judge of how 
you support science. And in a sense, yeah, I think I

42:28.659 --> 42:31.623
would agree with you. I think some of these are 
overemphasized in the sense of, well, the public

42:31.663 --> 42:44.079
will support this, or we can put it in such a way that 
the public will recognize its, quote,

42:31.663 --> 42:44.079
importance. So, okay, that's a good way to go. I 
think many of these, part of this work is motivated

42:49.786 --> 42:54.012
by We need money, and this is a way to get money. And 
not necessarily because it's necessarily the

42:58.164 --> 43:00.669
best science. I'm sure that if you ask a general 
cross-section of scientists what are the best

43:00.709 --> 43:14.599
problems to concentrate on, that these would be 
mentioned, but they certainly wouldn't be the

43:00.709 --> 43:14.599
unique ones. And I think things like the SETI 
program, there's

43:15.355 --> 43:25.729
a lot of interest in this, and it is scientifically 
important.

43:28.433 --> 43:31.657
On the other hand, it's a little bit like the search 
for missing mass. You can put an awful lot of effort

43:33.200 --> 43:36.384
into it for very little return. And there's some 
balance point. in terms of what is the reasonable

43:40.887 --> 43:51.023
amount of resource and effort to put into this 
until you get some indication that there's

43:40.887 --> 43:51.023
something that really needs to be followed up. The 
program should not become ends in themselves when

43:52.205 --> 44:05.646
there's a little bit of a tendency, or more than a 
little bit of a tendency, for them to become simply

43:52.205 --> 44:05.646
a means of continuing support.

44:06.132 --> 44:11.477
Without the proper checks and balances, are we 
getting something back or are we really making

44:06.132 --> 44:11.477
progress? What do you think the state of astronomy 
is now? This includes planetary astronomy

44:14.060 --> 44:21.488
because we all sink or swim in the same ocean.

44:21.508 --> 44:22.369
Are we sinking? I think astronomy needs a...

44:23.149 --> 44:32.739
Well, I think it has stagnated a little bit. We see 
too much...

44:39.190 --> 44:40.852
Well, I think there's a little bit of fear out 
there. Nobody really knows how we're going to

44:40.872 --> 44:45.959
continue to support this institution.

44:51.485 --> 45:01.138
I think there's a feeling that we're going to see a 
retraction and everybody is kind of scrabbling to

44:51.485 --> 45:01.138
make sure that they're not the parts that are cut. 
And in facing this retraction of support, uh i

45:07.608 --> 45:34.510
think people are not looking objectively at the 
science anymore but they're saying well what can i

45:07.608 --> 45:34.510
get money for there's too much focus on what can i 
get money for and too little on regardless of the

45:07.608 --> 45:34.510
money what science should we what are the what are 
the things that we must preserve in terms of

45:07.608 --> 45:34.510
science there are a few odd people like myself who 
would i will pursue what i think should be done in

45:34.945 --> 45:37.668
science, I don't have outside support. So I can 
speak a little bit objectively. I don't worry

45:39.249 --> 45:44.814
about protecting my resources because my 
resources are my own salary. And I mean, I came to

45:44.834 --> 45:48.578
this meeting, I paid my own way. And I go observing 
at National Radio Observatory, I pay my own way. I

45:53.503 --> 45:56.546
don't have support even from my own institution. 
Well, the institution doesn't have the money to

45:57.306 --> 45:59.108
give me. Everything comes from these outside 
grants. And when you do controversial work, it's

46:01.726 --> 46:05.831
very difficult to get these outside grants. I 
think that's wrong. And in that sense, I say our

46:08.054 --> 46:21.911
science is being driven by large

46:08.054 --> 46:21.911
money programs rather than supporting 
scientific ideas. Of course, you were at Lowell

46:23.093 --> 46:30.602
when it was still in the bailing wire and sealing 
wax era.
