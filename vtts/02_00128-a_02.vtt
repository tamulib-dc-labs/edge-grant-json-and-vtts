WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:14.091
And as I say, my mission was we had to get that 
archaic system that they had turned into an

00:02.596 --> 00:14.091
automated system. So having spent numerous hours 
in talking with Mr. Heaton about that, he said,

00:14.111 --> 00:24.064
well, look, I think what we need to do is create a new 
position. and make you coordinator of our data

00:24.533 --> 00:28.357
processing operation. So in 1967, well, they 
created that position and gave me that

00:28.557 --> 00:37.385
responsibility and hired a new assistant 
registrar and replaced me in the record section.

00:37.405 --> 00:43.350
So I went to work then on further automating the 
record system. And I wanted to do something about

00:43.370 --> 00:45.873
the registration system. I wanted to get it where 
it wasn't such a chore for a student. And I go back to

00:49.456 --> 00:53.680
my student day passport. I used to say on that 
campus as a student, I can well remember, I had no

00:54.588 --> 01:09.954
idea at the time I'd ever be in that position, but I 
used to say two things if I ever had any authority

00:54.588 --> 01:09.954
around this institution up here that I would like 
to correct. One of them was our registration

01:10.936 --> 01:14.402
system and the other was the fiscal office. I it was 
just in any student of the era that I'm talking

01:15.243 --> 01:37.113
about would certainly agree with me because we 
just again I think it was just people who have been

01:15.243 --> 01:37.113
there and been there and they were not willing to 
change with the times and with all of the wonderful

01:15.243 --> 01:37.113
opportunities that we had with the computer aid 
being initiated in. So we began to look at

01:40.977 --> 01:45.041
improving the registration system, although we 
had to do it on the card system. We then started

01:45.081 --> 01:56.951
going to a pre-registration system whereby a 
student would come in and visit with a counselor.

01:57.032 --> 02:08.622
And I also felt very strongly about every student 
should have a counselor in the academic area that

01:57.032 --> 02:08.622
knew about the program that they were pursuing and 
could sit down with them and have some valuable

02:09.226 --> 02:19.080
time and some counseling from the faculty 
members. So Mr. Runner went along with that and

02:19.140 --> 02:31.757
they put in academic counselors who were 
professors or who were members of the faculty in

02:19.140 --> 02:31.757
departments and we began building this the system 
that a student had at a contact point and that could

02:32.024 --> 02:42.416
start leading them toward a degree plan and that 
sort of thing. So we developed the

02:42.456 --> 02:53.848
pre-registration system at that time and started 
it on the freshmen who were coming in in the

02:42.456 --> 02:53.848
summertime to try it out and then later passed it on 
to the entire student body. Of course, that lasted

02:53.868 --> 03:01.677
for a while and then we felt like it needed to be 
upgraded even more and then went to another level.

03:02.230 --> 03:13.344
I wanted, one of the things I wanted to do in my 
career there was to make registration absolutely

03:02.230 --> 03:13.344
as easy as it could be made. And that later came true 
when I got in and got the touchstone registration

03:14.325 --> 03:21.634
system put in. After I did that, I truly felt that my 
mission was completed. All right now, so The first

03:29.500 --> 03:32.043
major changes came in the late 60s? Late 60s, early 
70s, yeah, that's right. And was it still key punch

03:34.886 --> 03:36.788
cards? It was still key punch because they had no, 
we had no terminals or anything at that time. All

03:41.634 --> 03:59.153
the data input was done by key punch cards and the 
student would go and register and then all this

03:41.634 --> 03:59.153
data would have to be taken to the computer center 
and key punch operators would punch this data in

03:41.634 --> 03:59.153
and build the student file and generate a sketch. 
All right, let's see. Mr. Heaton serves till when?

04:06.188 --> 04:09.261
Mr. Heaton serves until 1972. And Ed Cooper, this 
was under the Williams administration. And Ed

04:17.079 --> 04:34.082
Cooper, who had been, as you well know, an 
assistant to Dr. Williams in the President's

04:17.079 --> 04:34.082
office for some years prior to that, was named our 
first Dean of Admissions and Records in 1972.

04:34.102 --> 04:36.285
Well, I left a little bit of a gap. After 1967,

04:40.527 --> 04:45.755
In serving in this coordinator of data 
processing, I served in that for two years. And one

04:46.897 --> 04:53.126
day Mr. Heaton called me in in 69, and I'm mistaken. 
I need to stand corrected on what I said about

04:53.507 --> 04:56.411
Cooper's title. Mr. Heaton called me in in early 
69, and he said that Mr. Rudder had talked with him

05:04.964 --> 05:08.610
and they were going to restructure the office. And 
they made Mr. Heaton the first dean of admissions

05:09.316 --> 05:13.242
and records. I've been corrected in what I said if I 
could be. And they were going to make me registrar.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.999
So I became registrar in February of 1969. And 
Heaton was the dean of admissions and records. All

05:25.822 --> 05:26.543
right. Did your responsibilities change with the 
title change? I had more responsibility, of

05:31.186 --> 05:34.191
course. At that time, what did they do? We started 
fanning out and increasing our staff because the

05:35.874 --> 05:41.765
enrollment was growing. My job entailed, of 
course, the supervision of all of the student

05:41.885 --> 05:56.350
academic records, the residency, the assignment 
of classroom space. One of the things that I

05:56.903 --> 06:01.107
insisted on when Mr. Rudder wanted me to become 
registrar, and I had to talk to him about it.

06:11.398 --> 06:25.172
Classroom space on the campus belonged, at least 
every department head thought, because they were

06:11.398 --> 06:25.172
in academic building, that they should teach all 
their classes in the academic building. You've

06:26.030 --> 06:28.393
been through some of this. And it was almost 
impossible to get any kind of respectable

06:28.413 --> 06:35.942
classroom utilization. And so one of the things 
that I saw that one had to do to centralize that

06:35.962 --> 06:50.559
function, and if we were going to be responsible 
for it, then we needed to have the authority to

06:35.962 --> 06:50.559
assign. So one of the things that I said to the 
president was that I want to guarantee that the

06:55.038 --> 07:01.869
classroom space will be given, hopefully, to the 
registrar. And that we will have total authority

07:02.390 --> 07:06.637
to assign the space. And he agreed to do that. And it 
made a lot of the faculty unhappy because they had

07:08.620 --> 07:14.870
to walk across campus to a class. But our classroom 
utilization rose to the level of the best in the

07:14.890 --> 07:21.180
state, according to the coordinators. Can you 
think of some anecdotes that exemplify some of the

07:21.447 --> 07:27.373
complaints? Well, yeah, one that comes to mind 
immediately was, and we got ribbed for it for

07:28.895 --> 07:50.357
years, and I'm sorry I can't remember the 
department head that just happened then, but he

07:28.895 --> 07:50.357
was one that was very much opposed to leaving his 
building. we have the authority to do it, well, we

07:50.827 --> 08:01.221
made an assignment for him to teach a class, and it 
just so turned out that we scheduled him in the

07:50.827 --> 08:01.221
men's restroom. In his building. In his building, 
and you can imagine the fun he had with that, and it

08:02.443 --> 08:08.632
lasted for a long, long time. As a matter of fact, I 
think that was Dr. Clifford Sumane of the Capitol

08:08.652 --> 08:13.438
Engineering, I believe. No, I'm Sumane. No, I'm 
Sumane. That's correct. But... There was a lot of

08:19.075 --> 08:26.746
complaining, but actually, I mean, they 
complained mainly because it was the

08:19.075 --> 08:26.746
inconvenience. All of them knew in their hearts 
that the only way to have it done and have it done for

08:26.906 --> 08:38.963
it would be a good management tool was if somebody 
had to say, look, I have this room vacant over here.

08:38.983 --> 08:40.605
It's just the size you need. I'm sorry you don't 
have to walk across the way here to go to it. But they

08:45.331 --> 08:46.433
knew in there. I remember too, don't I, some 
complaints about faculty members not wanting a

08:46.733 --> 08:56.307
class except at the hour convenient to them. 
That's correct. That's correct. And most of them

08:57.889 --> 08:59.932
wanted those from 8 to 12. That's right. And so that 
we expanded today. The excellent point, I'd

09:05.540 --> 09:12.150
forgotten about that. And most of them were on 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8 to 12. And so

09:18.431 --> 09:23.718
obviously one could see that that was not helping 
our utilization. So we spread the day out and also

09:23.738 --> 09:30.326
started the Tuesday, Thursday hour and a half 
classes. Do you remember how that change came

09:30.446 --> 09:34.352
about? The Tuesday, Thursday? Yeah, we dropped 
the Saturday. It was in the mid-60s. Yeah, yeah.

09:42.877 --> 09:44.699
Was it the mid-60s? Somewhere in the 60s, because 
Randy Mattson came as a prospective student,

09:44.719 --> 10:02.921
brought up here by Jack Knox and John Lindsey, and 
it was on a Saturday, and he wanted to meet some

09:44.719 --> 10:02.921
faculty members, and it was the first year we 
didn't have Saturday classes. And they brought

10:03.682 --> 10:11.972
him over to Nagel Hall because Lindsey knew there 
were usually some history faculty over there

10:03.682 --> 10:11.972
hanging around. And that's where I met him. 
Garland Bayless was there. And Randy and I still

10:18.348 --> 10:20.831
remember that Saturday. I think it was 64 or 5, but 
I'm not sure. It seems to me, I think it might have

10:27.920 --> 10:34.368
been after that, later than that. Maybe not too 
much later, because it happened after I came over

10:34.448 --> 10:39.034
there. I don't remember any complaints, do you? No 
complaints, no. And reason was that the students

10:41.872 --> 10:49.680
and the faculty both didn't have to look for 
Saturday in class or Saturday in form. So I think

10:50.420 --> 10:52.703
everybody was very happy with it. But the 
expanding of the day, the faculty member that

10:52.723 --> 11:02.632
wanted it at 8 o'clock in the morning now may be 
having to teach it at 2 in the afternoon. That took a

11:02.792 --> 11:07.677
while for that to soak in or to get acceptance. All 
right, let's go back now. Cooper takes over in 72.

11:11.969 --> 11:18.902
What

11:11.969 --> 11:18.902
was the search process, as far as you know? I don't 
think there was a search process. Did anybody

11:21.427 --> 11:24.112
contact you or anybody else? No, no. Dr. 
Williams...

11:31.248 --> 11:37.737
just chose Ed Cooper to be the replacement for 
Lloyd. I one day happened to have lunch with him.

11:41.783 --> 11:46.811
And as we were going back, he asked me who I thought 
could do. And I mentioned Cooper, and he quickly

11:46.831 --> 11:52.799
let me know that a lot of other people had mentioned 
Ed. He was asking who would understand the campus

11:54.101 --> 12:00.951
student body, who would have credibility 
immediately. and also who would be open in his

12:01.623 --> 12:08.252
communications with him. And he'd already found 
Ed to be that way. Now, did you know Ed well before?

12:14.240 --> 12:15.442
Oh, I know him well, yes. Dr. Williams' choice for 
Ed Cooper was an absolute excellent choice for the

12:16.403 --> 12:22.471
reasons you just named. I mean, Ed was the job in 
admissions and records that is the toughest job

12:32.234 --> 12:35.657
from a public relations standpoint, is 
admissions. Records, you don't have that much.

12:38.380 --> 12:43.465
Most of your work in public relations relating to 
records has to do with registration. It has to do

12:43.946 --> 12:46.348
with transcripts. And that was another thing that 
I wanted to improve there was an immediate

12:46.368 --> 12:53.075
transcript service. I mean, I felt that students 
were entitled to get their transcripts as quickly

12:53.095 --> 12:58.680
as we could possibly get them out. It hinged on 
getting in schools elsewhere. It hinged on

13:02.979 --> 13:10.048
employment and things like that, and we owed them a 
very vast turnaround service. And residency.

13:11.811 --> 13:22.565
Residency was not a pleasant job at all because 
everybody wanted to be classified as a resident of

13:11.811 --> 13:22.565
Texas, simply for monetary reasons. If you well 
remember, there was a significant difference

13:22.585 --> 13:28.853
between in-state tuition and non-resident 
tuition. But admissions was getting tighter and

13:29.204 --> 13:37.218
tighter and tighter, thus making the job tougher 
and tougher and tougher. You recall the time we

13:37.238 --> 13:45.573
went through our classroom space difficulties 
here, and we had to kind of curb the enrollment. And

13:45.593 --> 13:51.043
Ed Cooper was a knack for that. Ed was not a person 
that cared about any kind of controversy. He

13:56.808 --> 13:59.012
didn't prefer that at all. But he was such a PR 
person that he could sit down and assume most of the

14:00.374 --> 14:08.548
difficulty. Share some examples of admission 
stories and anecdotes. Gee. Well, again, I wasn't

14:16.606 --> 14:24.297
directly involved with admissions that much. I 
recall a lot of fun that Ed had with the old catalogs

14:24.558 --> 14:44.908
that had some admission requirements in there 
that you probably remember, and that one was that

14:24.558 --> 14:44.908
in order to enter A&M in the earlier years, you had 
to be free of infectious diseases, and I don't

14:45.378 --> 14:52.729
think I have that all correctly. And no felony 
convictions. No felony convictions, and such

14:54.652 --> 14:58.919
things as that. One of the things that helped us 
tremendously in admissions, if I recall

14:59.780 --> 15:13.461
correctly, was that in the years in the 70s and even 
up in the early 80s, If a student didn't qualify, we

15:13.711 --> 15:26.145
had the probationary program that we could bring 
them in. Ed was able to handle a lot of these cases

15:26.246 --> 15:38.740
that way where, you know, a student might not 
qualify and the parents were here and if they were

15:26.246 --> 15:38.740
former students, you know, I can't understand why 
my son or daughter can't get in school. And rather

15:39.310 --> 15:56.176
than just say no, we had the program where, look, 
I'm willing, if you'll come

15:39.310 --> 15:56.176
here in the summertime, you might as well come at 
all. The probationary program was a wonderful

15:56.216 --> 15:59.001
program to have. Also, it said to the students, 
look, we haven't denied you. If you can come here

16:04.133 --> 16:16.148
and do the work, make a C-outreach or whatever it 
is, then you have an opportunity to be a full-time

16:04.133 --> 16:16.148
student in the fall or the semester, whichever 
time you qualify. So you're saying that was a good

16:16.168 --> 16:17.990
practice? Excellent practice. Do you have any 
guesstimate as to what percentage of the

16:19.152 --> 16:24.499
probationary admits made it? Yes, I do. About 60% 
made it. Which... May not seem to be that high, but

16:33.378 --> 16:44.668
on the other hand, they wouldn't have gotten it if 
we had just had a complete denial in the beginning

16:33.378 --> 16:44.668
and said, no, I'm sorry. Now, as our admission 
requirements get stiffer and stiffer, did the

16:46.749 --> 16:59.260
former student complaints, did they increase in 
number also? Yes, they did. But it seems to me, if I

17:03.753 --> 17:15.147
recall correctly, Haskell, we still had the 
probationary program. And it still gave us an

17:15.588 --> 17:23.617
opportunity to say to a student, hey, here it is, if 
you can do it. And you see, when I left there in 1988,

17:23.637 --> 17:32.308
prior to that time, we were still doing that. I 
don't know that that's available nowadays. I

17:36.154 --> 17:37.616
don't know exactly what they're doing. And then 
also the caps have come in since then. Can you share

17:41.901 --> 17:49.870
any examples of apparent offers of bribes to get 
somebody in? Did you ever hear of any? Oh, yes. I

17:52.554 --> 17:54.396
particularly had that. I had that face me one time 
in particular. I can remember very well who was up.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.239
a gentleman from Washington, D.C. He was a huge 
contractor up there. As a matter of fact, he built

18:08.165 --> 18:11.690
the FBI building. And he wanted his daughter into 
veterinary medicine school here. And I was told,

18:15.777 --> 18:29.498
as we worked many times, that he had, this came from 
some former students, that the guy was coming and

18:15.777 --> 18:29.498
we needed to visit with him and whatnot. And I did. I 
think we even went to the country club and had

18:32.412 --> 18:37.498
dinner and whatnot, the usual thing. And I told him 
from the beginning that there was just absolutely

18:37.518 --> 18:49.331
no way because you had to be a resident of Texas to 
get in our vet college. And at the end of the

18:49.351 --> 18:59.282
conversation, he reached in his pocket and he 
said, I just need to know who to make it to and how

18:49.351 --> 18:59.282
much. Not to me, he wasn't inferring it to me, but he 
was talking more or less about making a donation to

18:59.667 --> 19:08.555
the institution. And I said, I'm sorry, we can't. 
So you would get hints along like this from time to

19:10.377 --> 19:15.821
time. And NM being the kind of school it is, and they 
wanted their son or daughter here, it happened,

19:15.841 --> 19:22.808
yes. All right, under Ed, did any organizational 
changes occur?

19:29.907 --> 19:31.729
Let's see. You continued as the registrar? I 
continued as registrar. Now, what had happened

19:35.954 --> 19:44.704
was that we had employed a director of admissions. 
As I mentioned to you earlier, when I came there in

19:44.904 --> 19:54.936
1965, Mr. Heaton was both director of admissions 
and registrar. Well, shortly after I had been

19:55.253 --> 20:03.683
there for, I think, a year or two, a couple years or 
whatever, then a director of admissions retired.

20:04.344 --> 20:17.160
And when Ed came in, well,

20:04.344 --> 20:17.160
I think the fellow that had been there maybe had 
left, and that position was vacant.

20:21.798 --> 20:23.661
It was vacant. We hired Bill Lay at that

20:23.721 --> 20:31.792
time. Now where did Bill come from? Bill came from 
the public schools. It seems to me that he was in

20:37.921 --> 20:42.928
Austin, I believe. He might have been employed

20:42.948 --> 20:48.075
in No, I don't think so. He got his PhD from the 
University of Texas, but I don't think he was

20:50.602 --> 20:55.168
employed. And this is in the early 70s? This was in 
the 70s, that's right. So Cooper, you, and Lay then

20:59.273 --> 21:04.741
are together for?

21:06.403 --> 21:07.504
Well, let's see. 15 years? Cooper left in 86. 86, 
okay. 86, and he came in 72 for 14 years. That's

21:15.214 --> 21:16.476
correct. And y'all move out of the Koch building 
over to the old Exchange Store building about

21:17.468 --> 21:24.020
when? I think we moved, I believe we moved into the 
Exchange Store building about 1976. Where did the

21:32.555 --> 21:36.743
idea of the name for that building, new name for 
that building come from? The Heaton building? I

21:39.281 --> 21:40.803
was the architect of that. I felt like that Mr. 
Heaton had served the institution well and so

21:40.823 --> 21:54.622
there was a committee formed and we submitted it to 
the Board of Regents and they approved it.

21:54.642 --> 21:55.423
Alright. Now let's see. So you didn't work for 
Rutter. No. Alright. So it's Williams. But you...

22:07.317 --> 22:10.021
No, you... I didn't work for Williams, correct? 
No, no, no, but I'm talking about during the time

22:13.526 --> 22:15.969
they were president. Yeah, Rudder was president 
when you... Rudder was president when I came, when

22:18.112 --> 22:23.459
I started in the registrar's office in 65. Yeah, 
what... And then in 70... No, from your point of

22:23.479 --> 22:33.633
view, as a worker, as a registrar, describe Mr. 
Rudder's style of leadership.

22:39.042 --> 22:39.523
Well, Mr. Rudder's style of leadership was very 
direct. And, of course, you couldn't help but

22:44.936 --> 22:54.259
recognize a lot of that was due to his military 
experience. Easy man to talk with. Easy man to get

22:56.558 --> 22:58.601
in to see. There were times when Mr. Heaton might 
not be available and he would want something and

22:59.463 --> 23:08.578
you'd go down and talk with him. So I became very, 
very well acquainted with Mr. Glutter. I liked his

23:12.124 --> 23:13.025
style. I liked it because it was a lot like I am. 
very, very direct. You always knew where he stood

23:21.039 --> 23:38.161
type of administration and I think he had a great 
amount of respect for people that were doing their

23:21.039 --> 23:38.161
job and he recognized and he felt rather close to 
it. Now, his key secretary was Nelda. Nelda Ryle.

23:42.948 --> 23:45.010
At that time. Yes, and was she there She was there 
just about the time he got there, wasn't she?

23:50.880 --> 23:51.861
Almost all the time. She worked for Dr. Graff. She 
was Dr. Graff's secretary. That's right, that's

23:55.044 --> 23:55.805
right. And then moved in for another. That's 
correct. She was Dr. Graff's secretary when I was

23:57.726 --> 24:01.950
hired in 65. She was there in the co-chair. 
Describe her manner and style. Wonderful,

24:07.255 --> 24:11.879
pleasant, all-business lady. She was very, very 
valuable to any administrator because she knew

24:19.128 --> 24:23.232
She knew the people very well that that 
administrator would have to deal with. She was a

24:23.292 --> 24:31.722
good informant, so the administrator knew what to 
expect when that person came in. She had a

24:31.742 --> 24:34.705
tremendous amount of background on everybody. 
Who were the key people that Earl Rudder most

24:34.725 --> 24:41.492
trusted, if he needed advice? Back in those days, 
Haskell, And this is just my opinion, but I always

24:47.191 --> 25:06.615
felt that the president, particularly Mr. 
Rutter, he picked, I think, in my opinion, I'm

24:47.191 --> 25:06.615
correct, he basically handpicked his Board of 
Regents. It's not the process that they go through

25:07.116 --> 25:09.479
today. I know for a fact, because he told me from 
time to time, make a list of who he wanted to be at

25:17.161 --> 25:39.210
that time they were called board of directors and 
it was just a matter of submitting that to the

25:17.161 --> 25:39.210
governor and generally he got the people he wanted 
so I would have to believe that he trusted his board

25:17.161 --> 25:39.210
greatly and you do remember the name of the 
governor during most of Mr. Rudder's presidency

25:39.230 --> 25:46.560
that would be John B. Connolly who was a personal 
friend of General Rudder And also, you're

25:47.620 --> 25:56.570
probably aware that he was personal friends with 
Lyndon Johnson, the President of the United

25:47.620 --> 25:56.570
States, of course. I always felt, Haskell, that as 
a side comment to General Rudder,

25:57.932 --> 26:13.329
Texas A&M had General Rudder at the right time. I 
had gone to school here, and our facilities were

26:13.569 --> 26:17.053
horrible. In the classrooms, in the 
laboratories, it was bad, it really was. There

26:23.594 --> 26:30.643
were a few areas that were all right, but generally 
speaking, facilities were not good at all.

26:31.043 --> 26:47.243
General Rudder was here, and I've always thought 
that his friendship with John Connolly, the

26:31.043 --> 26:47.243
governor of Texas, and the president of the United 
States, he was able, A&M was not getting their

26:31.043 --> 26:47.243
share. for what they needed out of Austin. Our 
friends at the University of Texas were way ahead

26:49.481 --> 26:52.264
of us. And I always felt that because of that 
relationship, General Rudder was able to get a lot

26:53.365 --> 27:04.737
of the monies lined up, although he didn't get to 
see all of the benefits those brought. Dr.

27:04.757 --> 27:13.787
Williams, though, on the other hand, came in, and 
he was a man that sprung this up into the high

27:04.757 --> 27:13.787
recognition that this university received or 
started to receive in the 70s. But the funds were

27:19.784 --> 27:30.818
pouring in for what Rudder had set in place in our 
buildings and our facilities all certainly

27:19.784 --> 27:30.818
changed very quickly there. And Jack Williams was 
right for A&M at the time he was here. We were

27:34.623 --> 27:38.488
blessed with those two presidents in the town. I 
agree. I feel if we reverse the order, they both

27:39.930 --> 27:42.793
fail. They're going to flunk. Yeah. But by having 
them as we did, it was just superb. All right, but

27:49.472 --> 27:56.521
now on the staff, here on the campus, whom did Mr. 
Rutter listen to? Mr. Rutter had a great amount of

27:56.541 --> 28:01.588
trust for Fred Benson, Dean of Engineering. A 
great amount of trust for him.

28:15.395 --> 28:21.225
Help me a little bit on

28:15.395 --> 28:21.225
business affair area. Oh, thank you. Tom Cherry. 
He had a great amount. Tom was in board with Trans

28:26.014 --> 28:32.185
World Airlines in New York, I believe, with the 
Vice President. Yes, and he was able to lure Tom

28:32.205 --> 28:35.491
here. Very, very... Mr. Rutter hired Tom? Mr. 
Rutter hired Tom, and Mr. Rutter also had a great

28:39.037 --> 28:44.927
amount of trust in Clark Diebel. He brought him 
with him. He brought Diebel here. Diebel was in the

28:46.771 --> 28:54.405
land office with General Rutter when he was in 
Austin, and he trusted him very, very much. Do you

28:55.527 --> 28:57.450
remember any... Stories, allegations of fiscal 
mismanagement during those years? Under Clark

29:02.714 --> 29:03.715
Neville? Well, under Rutter. I never heard of any. 
I remember none.

29:13.327 --> 29:28.264
Mr. Rutter had a great amount of trust in Clyde 
Freeman, who he knew Clyde and the president

29:13.327 --> 29:28.264
didn't always get along about a lot of things 
sometimes, but Mr. Rutter trusted Mr. Freeman

29:28.683 --> 29:52.052
because he knew Mr. Freeman knew the state statute 
as though he had written it, and he knew he would

29:28.683 --> 29:52.052
keep him where he needed to be kept as far as the 
administration of any kind of funds or things like

29:28.683 --> 29:52.052
that. And I think Mr. Rutter also was the man that 
brought Frank Huber here. Yes. Because if I'm not

30:00.392 --> 30:03.540
mistaken, Mr. Rudder had said that he wanted the 
best school man, if not in Texas, in America. And I

30:09.175 --> 30:16.493
think that he's the one that came up with one prank 
down at My 7th

30:16.945 --> 30:24.993
grade band director, my 12th grade principal, and 
my superintendent. He had also been in Austin when

30:25.053 --> 30:27.336
Mr. Rudder had some Austin experiences, and I 
think they were well acquainted there. Am I

30:33.762 --> 30:39.068
correct also that on campus matters, Mr. Rudder 
sometimes would ask Ed Cooper a question about

30:39.108 --> 30:43.392
this or that? Oh, very much so. as far as Ed was his 
assistant, and Ed, again, back to what you said

30:46.342 --> 31:00.296
earlier that Jack Williams felt, Ed had a direct 
pipeline to the former students. He knew so many of

31:00.736 --> 31:04.159
them. And he had been to so many of their meetings 
and whatnot that he was able to go out and test the

31:04.179 --> 31:12.768
waters, I think, many times for the president. And 
Ed was just a... He was... Everybody liked Ed, and

31:16.447 --> 31:19.813
everybody would talk to Ed. And Ed spent a lot of 
time going around the campus and visiting with

31:19.833 --> 31:25.282
people. So he was an excellent one to have out 
amongst the troops to get the sentiment of

31:25.743 --> 31:35.579
whatever the subject might be. A goofy question 
pops in my brain. Do you remember any old Army good

31:38.063 --> 31:40.868
bull?
