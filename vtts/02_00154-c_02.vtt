WEBVTT

00:04.368 --> 00:06.130
fell unconscious at my feet.

00:11.814 --> 00:21.643
And the headlinesman came over

00:11.814 --> 00:21.643
and asked, what's wrong with him?

00:25.626 --> 00:31.311
In my naivete about medical matters, I said, I 
don't know. I think he's knocked down.

00:36.278 --> 00:39.862
The official then made the first mistake. By 
rolling. This lifeless body over. And we could see

00:44.568 --> 00:46.770
no color in his eyes. He then signaled for some 
players to come from the sideline. And carry

00:54.820 --> 00:56.902
himple. Off the field of play, which they did 
without a stretcher.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.133
He regained consciousness before the game was 
over. but could not move his arms and legs.

01:14.063 --> 01:29.082
Saturday morning, back in Orange, we learned that 
his spinal cord had been broken just below the base

01:14.063 --> 01:29.082
of his neck, and he died Monday. An unforgettable 
lesson about important things in life and its

01:29.103 --> 01:34.770
meaning.

01:39.273 --> 01:44.580
In track, I tried to be a sprinter and ran on the 
relay teams. But again, we were not very

01:46.603 --> 01:49.888
outstanding. When commencement came, I believe 
that I was third in the class. Our valedictorian,

01:58.880 --> 02:06.951
Charles McCormick, set some academic 
achievement marks that probably still are

01:58.880 --> 02:06.951
unbroken. His average was astonishingly high.

02:13.243 --> 02:16.006
His great handicap was that he had no personality. 
If you gave him the material to memorize, he could

02:16.066 --> 02:24.916
do so quickly and hand it back to you verbally or in 
writing. But if you ask him to work with people,

02:25.456 --> 02:36.769
to understand an athletic event,

02:40.124 --> 02:41.305
or be friendly. He did not know how to do that. The 
number two person in the class, Charles Anderson,

02:45.048 --> 03:02.984
didn't go to college because his family owned many 
hundreds of rice land under which there was some

02:45.048 --> 03:02.984
nice oily liquid.

03:03.004 --> 03:06.067
For me, the choice was Austin College. The 
reverend Dr. Drake had encouraged me to consider

03:09.672 --> 03:18.681
it

03:09.672 --> 03:18.681
one day in a conversation at church.

03:21.825 --> 03:38.802
Then at summer church camp,

03:21.825 --> 03:38.802
before my senior year in high school, there were a 
number of people who spoke highly of Austin

03:21.825 --> 03:38.802
College.

03:41.566 --> 03:50.459
And we went, mother and dad took me there to visit

03:41.566 --> 03:50.459
the day after Christmas in 1947. Being

03:50.900 --> 04:03.779
naive about such matters, it did not occur to us 
that colleges closed down a great deal, closed

03:50.900 --> 04:03.779
down during the Christmas break. We entered what 
seemed to be a very large main building. and soon

04:11.806 --> 04:17.093
encountered what I thought was an old guy in the 
hallway. We asked if he could help us find the

04:19.095 --> 04:30.750
president's office and he invited us to follow him 
and he would lead us there. We walked down the

04:30.771 --> 04:40.463
hallway, we walked to the left of the and

04:41.219 --> 04:53.499
he walked behind the president's desk and 
introduced himself as Edward B. Grant,

04:53.579 --> 05:01.311
G-U-E-R-R-A-N-T,

04:53.579 --> 05:01.311
who was, in fact, the president. His cordial 
welcome attracted our confident

05:09.940 --> 05:12.424
And so I headed in that direction.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.935
A few months later in the summer of 1948. While 
visiting grandparents.

05:25.302 --> 05:27.045
I went to Sherman. Introduce myself to the 
football coach.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.323
Whose name I cannot remember at this moment.

05:42.323 --> 05:52.538
who turned out to have been the captain of the last 
Newt Rockne, K-N-U-T-E, R-O-C-K-N-E, that last

05:42.323 --> 05:52.538
Newt Rockne team at Notre Dame.

05:55.602 --> 06:08.601
I went up for early practice for the Austin College 
Kangaroos

05:55.602 --> 06:08.601
and was delighted to be on that campus. From the 
first day until the present, it has seemed that for

06:10.893 --> 06:22.266
this student, Austin College was just right. A 
comparatively small liberal arts college,

06:22.286 --> 06:37.423
which provided a

06:22.286 --> 06:37.423
lot of direct personal attention to each student. 
and real development, their personality and

06:38.922 --> 06:48.814
talent.

06:48.834 --> 07:08.136
I lived in what we called Kangaroo Manor,

06:48.834 --> 07:08.136
a World War II one-story barrack building which 
had been moved to the campus as a residence for

06:48.834 --> 07:08.136
members Of the athletic squad of the AC athletic 
squad.

07:20.493 --> 07:24.338
Good fortune came my way and having a history 
course.

07:28.984 --> 07:32.588
From Henry M Sidner, SYDNOR.

07:35.234 --> 07:51.250
member of an old Virginia Presbyterian family

07:35.234 --> 07:51.250
who was in his first year of service at Austin 
College, having served in the public school

07:35.234 --> 07:51.250
system of West Virginia for a number of years.

07:54.493 --> 08:03.182
Mr. Sedner's manner made a lifetime shaping 
impact And also I became a close friend of the older

08:05.474 --> 08:14.027
Sidner son, Ned.

08:20.878 --> 08:23.702
Within the next two and a half years, I got to visit 
the Sidner home, two blocks south of the campus,

08:25.167 --> 08:35.722
and was impressed that there were books on the 
shelves and art on the walls. Mrs. Sidner seemed to

08:37.024 --> 08:46.197
be a remarkably talented cook, and I ate food that I 
had never seen before. They went birdwatching,

08:46.257 --> 08:52.947
which at first seemed to me to be a waste of time.

08:56.926 --> 09:13.425
But then that effort soon imparted a greater

08:56.926 --> 09:13.425
interest in and knowledge of wildlife.

09:25.138 --> 09:25.178
My

09:28.533 --> 09:56.295
Extracurricular activities during those years 
included work on the campus paper

09:28.533 --> 09:56.295
based on having worked, having been a member of the 
staff of the high school paper, the Tiger

09:28.533 --> 09:56.295
Scratches, and the Stark High Yearbook, the 
Orange Peel.

09:59.768 --> 10:02.572
I was in the kangaroo band for a time.

10:13.286 --> 10:22.098
Also, and enjoyed the opportunity to be included 
in many activities.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.666
The realities of the world changed

10:29.924 --> 10:54.987
the realities of the world became

10:29.924 --> 10:54.987
more instant

10:29.924 --> 10:54.987
early in 1950

10:29.924 --> 10:54.987
when Ned Sidner and I sat behind his father and 
Jemmy Story, S-T-O-R-E-Y,

10:57.363 --> 11:11.201
a member of the religion faculty and a dear friend 
of the Sidners.

11:11.962 --> 11:21.514
At a baseball game

11:11.962 --> 11:21.514
where Chuck Taylor, representing the Converse 
Shoe Company,

11:24.886 --> 11:33.354
One of the old one of the original Boston Celtics 
gave us an exhibition of basketball. Soon after

11:33.374 --> 11:38.259
the game that event was over. Mr Sidner had a heart 
attack and died in a few hours. Within a few weeks,

11:46.326 --> 11:51.231
Mrs Sidner asked me if I would like to come and rent a 
room at their house since she was in need of cash. I

11:58.561 --> 12:14.923
did and that cemented more deeply my respect for 
that family and tied me more closely to the dream of

11:58.561 --> 12:14.923
becoming a college faculty member.

12:20.810 --> 12:44.900
Far back in the trailer house days, I had concocted 
a dream of going to West Point, possibly because

12:20.810 --> 12:44.900
Glenn Davis and Doc Blanchard had led the Army 
football teams to some memorable winning

12:20.810 --> 12:44.900
streaks, to a memorable winning streak during the 
war.

12:48.825 --> 12:50.547
I wrote to the Congressman and told him of my dream 
to go to West Point

12:52.450 --> 13:06.951
using writing and pencil on notebook paper 
without my parents' knowledge.

13:09.495 --> 13:20.230
He responded by telling me that I would need to get a 
little older and become prepared for the for the

13:21.948 --> 13:25.272
great competition to go to the Military Academy.

13:29.337 --> 13:40.991
Thus, I should take

13:29.337 --> 13:40.991
the college preparatory courses and send him my 
grades at the end of each semester.

13:43.854 --> 13:47.719
With that encouragement, I quietly proceeded 
with that task.

13:50.652 --> 14:19.309
applied for the appointment my senior in high 
school and was identified as an alternate

13:50.652 --> 14:19.309
appointee if the principal one of the principals 
turned down he since i was 17 since my 17th birthday

13:50.652 --> 14:19.309
occurred in the spring of my senior year he 
suggested that i go on to college take a full

14:20.774 --> 14:29.509
college prep year, and then, if I did well, he would 
appoint me the following year. As we proceeded

14:31.873 --> 14:47.018
with those realities, I was to go to Fort Sam 
Houston, take a final exam to ensure that I would be

14:31.873 --> 14:47.018
qualified for the West Point

14:48.382 --> 14:50.845
And mention was made of my taking an oath. Of eight 
years service.

14:56.153 --> 15:00.699
When I raised the question that West Point was only 
a four year institution.

15:03.203 --> 15:09.432
I received the shocking response that after West 
Point I would be required to serve four years of

15:03.203 --> 15:09.432
active duty.

15:12.216 --> 15:14.939
Quickly, I knew that I did not want to do that. And so 
that. dream vanished instantly

15:19.786 --> 15:47.886
it must have been paragraph it must have been the 
influence of mr sidner and a few others that turned

15:19.786 --> 15:47.886
me toward the hope of being a college faculty 
member

15:19.786 --> 15:47.886
enjoying history and literature courses 
Equally,

15:50.009 --> 16:15.783
I majored in history and English,

15:50.009 --> 16:15.783
taking a lot of American history

15:50.009 --> 16:15.783
and American literature courses.

16:15.803 --> 16:19.628
Because the tuition at Austin College The tuition 
fee

16:20.283 --> 16:40.090
required that everyone pay full tuition if they 
took 12 hours or more,

16:20.283 --> 16:40.090
but it allowed anyone who paid that fee to take as 
many hours as they wanted. I took an overload

16:41.112 --> 16:47.961
almost every semester.

16:50.455 --> 17:05.336
And as I entered my fourth year at the college,

16:50.455 --> 17:05.336
was nearing graduation.

17:05.356 --> 17:19.956
Mr. Sidner had been replaced by another

17:05.356 --> 17:19.956
teacher who touched my life.

17:21.472 --> 17:24.075
markedly, Elmer Flaccus.

17:27.258 --> 17:41.454
Professor Flaccus was a notable, quote, 
character because of his idiosyncrasies, sense

17:27.258 --> 17:41.454
of humor, and occasional displays of 
disorganization.

17:43.797 --> 17:49.723
On the other hand, he was a very sensitive, 
helpful, and generous person.

17:54.513 --> 17:59.518
At one in one long conversation when I indicated to 
him my goal. My dream of being a college faculty

18:00.459 --> 18:02.701
member. But. Being with. Out. Any real knowledge 
of what it might. Take in time. Ability and

18:17.056 --> 18:18.778
expenditures. To get a PhD. He suggested that I 
finish my undergraduate degree the first

18:22.947 --> 18:48.128
semester of my senior year and then stay at Austin 
College that spring

18:22.947 --> 18:48.128
and begin work on a master's degree, which 
required 24 course hours and six hours of credit

18:22.947 --> 18:48.128
for the thesis.

18:51.415 --> 18:54.638
I took 18 hours that semester.

18:57.680 --> 19:21.220
And he helped me try to locate employment in the 
Sherman area for the 1952-53 year, while I

18:57.680 --> 19:21.220
completed the other master's courses at night and 
Saturdays. That opportunity came at Denison High

19:23.073 --> 19:25.697
School. So for my fifth year out of high school, I 
lived in Luckett Hall, the AC Dramatory, the first

19:27.179 --> 19:44.723
semester, and then rented a room from the Story 
family the second semester.

19:44.743 --> 19:52.033
An arrangement which allowed me to behave like a 
true professional in the daytime. but to return to

19:54.055 --> 20:09.771
undergraduate events at night and on weekends.

20:09.791 --> 20:21.362
My teaching load at the high school was four

20:09.791 --> 20:21.362
sophomore level classes in Western 
Civilization. a ninth grade literature class,

20:22.388 --> 20:28.053
and a ninth grade homeroom.

20:31.617 --> 20:48.413
The principal,

20:31.617 --> 20:48.413
a very highly regarded leader, Truman Smith, 
asked me what I was taking on Monday nights. When I

20:49.810 --> 21:12.527
indicated I had not yet gotten my schedule, he 
suggested I schedule something on Monday nights

20:49.810 --> 21:12.527
because the Denison High School PTA met that 
evening and they expected every faculty member to

20:49.810 --> 21:12.527
be present, but that if I had a course that night, 
they would certainly forgive my absence. In

21:13.942 --> 21:39.526
addition, he urged me not to be seen attending any 
movie in Denison on Sunday evening because many

21:13.942 --> 21:39.526
conservatives in that town believed that such 
attendance was a violation of the Sabbath.

21:39.546 --> 21:42.649
He also added, quote, These folks wouldn't care if 
you went to the picture show in Sherman because

21:44.215 --> 21:56.847
most Denison people believe that town is filled 
with sand anyway.

22:00.350 --> 22:05.676
Period, paragraph.

22:05.696 --> 22:13.463
Early in 1953, I came back from work at Denison High 
one afternoon. and was chatting with a buddy who

22:14.472 --> 22:28.226
was president of the AC student body that year, Jim 
Wilson.

22:36.294 --> 22:40.378
An English major, he also was dreaming of becoming 
a college faculty member, so I asked him where he

22:41.438 --> 22:48.452
thought he was going to graduate school. When he 
indicated that his choice was Rice, I tried to make

22:49.214 --> 23:02.080
him aware that Rice did not offer.

23:05.519 --> 23:17.749
degrees in the humanities and social sciences 
since all it did was quote engineering,

23:05.519 --> 23:17.749
architecture, and the natural sciences.

23:20.191 --> 23:35.104
He quickly grabbed a catalog,

23:20.191 --> 23:35.104
reaffirmed the availability of English, and then 
after turning a few more pages,

23:37.683 --> 23:43.010
informed me that Rice even offered a PhD in 
history. Paragraph. Knowing that Rice was

23:44.252 --> 24:05.361
totally tuition free for all students, I quickly 
asked for the catalog and verified the accuracy of

23:44.252 --> 24:05.361
his statement about the availability of history.

24:08.986 --> 24:31.974
In a few moments, I made my way to the Luckin Hall 
doorway of the Dean of Students, Rollin Montfort

24:08.986 --> 24:31.974
Rolf, R-O-L-F-E, M-O-N-T-F-O-R-D, 
R-O-L-L-I-N, Rollin Montfort Rolf.

24:31.994 --> 24:36.580
Dean Rolf was to most of us a Truly distinctive 
individual. Cadaverously thin.

24:45.812 --> 24:49.718
Devoid, as far as we were aware, of much 
personality.

24:53.464 --> 24:58.973
We usually called him the skeleton.

25:07.694 --> 25:15.181
I quickly asked him if he would be willing to write 
me and I asked if he had if it was true that he had gone

25:07.694 --> 25:15.181
to rice.

25:18.765 --> 25:22.108
He responded affirmatively and added that he had 
been president of first. Graduating class there

25:23.429 --> 25:25.631
in 1916. Then I asked if he would write a letter of 
recommendation in my behalf.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.722
A quiet smile was his response. and a bit of head 
shake, and he indicated no.

25:43.916 --> 25:47.421
Quote, no.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.003
I don't think I should. Let me just write a couple of 
notes to some old friends.

25:58.617 --> 26:04.245
Assuming that he had remembered some of my 
mischief and pranks as an undergraduate,

26:06.757 --> 26:14.971
I feared that I might not have much chance to get in.

26:14.991 --> 26:20.640
But within a few days I received an affirmative 
acceptance.

26:23.565 --> 26:31.077
And later that fall learned that the two quote 
friends that he had contacted were named McCann,

26:31.748 --> 26:46.551
M-C-C-A-N-N, and McCance, M-C-C-A-N-T-S, his 
classmates, one of whom was the chairman of the

26:31.748 --> 26:46.551
Graduate Admissions Committee and the other the 
vice chairman.

26:58.765 --> 27:09.217
The realities of the war had almost complicated, 
had complicated this routine a bit.

27:09.237 --> 27:16.365
The Korean War began in the summer of 1950 at the end 
of my sophomore year.

27:20.729 --> 27:27.557
As the fall semester began, it seemed that the 
American troops were winning that conflict And

27:28.786 --> 27:34.053
there was even a promise that, quote, the boys will 
be home by Christmas. When that season came,

27:36.556 --> 27:47.691
however, the Red Chinese had joined the attack on 
the Americans and the South Koreans, and

27:36.556 --> 27:47.691
everything seemed bleak.

27:50.535 --> 27:58.185
Many college males did not even return after the 
Christmas holidays.

28:00.494 --> 28:06.280
and I, being very draftable, soon joined the Naval 
Reserve there in Sherman.

28:09.324 --> 28:20.936
In the spring of that year at Denison High School, I 
received a notice to report for the draft on May 15,

28:09.324 --> 28:20.936
1953. I

28:21.437 --> 28:29.826
sought the advice of the Naval Reserve

28:30.515 --> 28:36.901
Chief Petty Officer.

28:40.685 --> 28:58.783
And he informed me that, he made me aware of the fact 
that I would have an automatic one year delay in

28:40.685 --> 28:58.783
reporting for active duty because of my having 
joined the Naval Reserve in January of 1951. And

29:02.209 --> 29:12.761
I told him that I had been admitted to Rice and I sure 
would like to finish that next year with that

29:02.209 --> 29:12.761
delay. He then suggested that I write to the draft 
board in Orange and ask for a one month delay in

29:14.964 --> 29:29.040
order to finish the year at Denison High School, 
the 1952-53 year at Denison High School. If they

29:30.353 --> 29:39.105
granted that month delay, then I could finish, 
would have a year delay from that date.

29:41.308 --> 29:47.717
Thankfully, the Orange Draft Board did so, and so I 
went on to Rice.

29:53.404 --> 29:59.753
Luckily, Jim Wilson joined me, and we rented a room 
at 410 Emerson

30:00.391 --> 30:22.316
from a delightful lady who was the grandmother of 
one of our coed friends at Austin College.

30:22.336 --> 30:29.824
Her house in an older section of town was a very 
comfortable place.

30:33.466 --> 30:48.082
And for $30 a month, we had a place to sleep and could 
put a few items in the refrigerator and cook on a hot

30:33.466 --> 30:48.082
plate.

30:51.605 --> 30:54.128
The courses at Rice were truly demanding.

30:56.891 --> 31:00.655
Quickly, I learned that Rice students were well 
prepared But I survived the year

31:02.896 --> 31:13.514
and then went off to the Navy in Charleston.

31:13.534 --> 31:19.044
That experience was truly unforgettable.

31:19.064 --> 31:25.355
Now we're going to cease.

31:25.375 --> 31:28.380
Now back after an interruption for gas.
