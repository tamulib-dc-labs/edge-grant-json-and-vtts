The following is an interview with Mr. Coulter 
Hoppus, distinguished lawyer and longtime

00:04.908 --> 00:12.119
resident of the Bryan College Station area. The 
interview is being recorded in Mr. Hoppus's

00:12.139 --> 00:18.469
office, which is located in the Virisco building 
in downtown Bryan. The interviewer is John

00:19.190 --> 00:24.418
O'Hara, and the date is March 30, 1976.

00:29.798 --> 00:40.934
To begin with, I'd like to thank you for letting me 
come and interview you.

00:42.036 --> 00:47.123
What we're trying to do is find out something about 
the early... This works as a microphone? Yes.

00:49.446 --> 00:52.190
Okay.

00:52.691 --> 00:56.717
What we're trying to do is get some information 
about the early inhabitants of Bryan.

01:05.641 --> 01:32.745
Between John O'Hara

01:05.641 --> 01:32.745
and Coper Hoppus, conducted in the office of Coper 
Hoppus in the Briscoe building in Bryan, Texas, at

01:05.641 --> 01:32.745
5 o'clock p.m.

01:05.641 --> 01:32.745
of the afternoon of March 30th, 1976, right? And 
the purpose of this interview is to get background

01:34.177 --> 01:47.531
information on early historical facts relating 
to Bryan and College Station and Brazos County,

01:34.177 --> 01:47.531
Texas. Okay, we'll go from there. To begin with, 
could you tell me when and where you were born? I was

01:55.099 --> 02:02.867
born in Hill County, Texas, in Hillsboro, in 1910, 
October 1910.

02:04.957 --> 02:12.826
Do you know where the Hoppus family came to Texas 
from? My father came to Texas from Arkansas,

02:12.846 --> 02:16.970
northeastern Arkansas. And they settled in Hill 
County? Not immediately.

02:27.161 --> 02:30.745
He was at many places in Texas working for the 
railroad. He came here during the time the

02:32.075 --> 02:54.648
railroads were being expanded and

02:32.075 --> 02:54.648
eventuated as being a station agent in Hillsboro 
for the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railroad, which

02:32.075 --> 02:54.648
was derogatorily referred to as the Bow Wheel. 
You, of course, didn't enjoy all that, but

02:56.771 --> 03:00.917
practically all railroads had various names that 
were applied to them, most of which related to the

03:02.112 --> 03:15.667
rather long names which they adopted. Is that the 
railroad that comes through here now? Is that the

03:18.289 --> 03:18.990
same? No, no. This railroad has since merged with 
Burlington, I believe, and the nearest place that

03:20.231 --> 03:31.984
comes to Bryant is North Zuch, which is east of 
here. But they, like the Missouri, Kansas, and

03:33.314 --> 03:43.803
Texas is called Acadia,

03:33.314 --> 03:43.803
you know. Yeah, well, that's

03:43.823 --> 03:58.036
a railroad in Georgia called the Tallulah Falls 
and something and of course on all the cars it had TF

03:43.823 --> 03:58.036
and something. It wasn't a very good railroad and 
it came out as a total failure. This was quite a

04:03.706 --> 04:08.913
common in the time, Red Road building. Do you know 
what year it was when it first came to Texas? My

04:14.401 --> 04:14.601
father? No, I do not. When did he move to Bryan? He 
never did move to Bryan. No. What caused your

04:23.774 --> 04:25.816
family to come to Bryan? My family didn't come to 
Bryan. I came to Bryan. I was orphaned and was

04:29.141 --> 04:32.025
brought here. be reared by a grandmother when I was 
12 years old. Can you tell me something about what

04:37.276 --> 04:58.265
Brian was like or what you can first remember about 
Brian

04:37.276 --> 04:58.265
when you came? Well, yes, I can remember good many 
things about it.

05:14.478 --> 05:31.459
Primarily the only difference now and then has 
been a rather large expansion of the residential

05:14.478 --> 05:31.459
community in a southeasterly direction towards

05:32.806 --> 05:36.109
College Station or towards A&M University.

05:39.592 --> 05:53.625
The time I came here as a little boy, well, Texas A&M 
University was much more remote from Bryan than it

05:39.592 --> 05:53.625
is today, or Bryan was much more remote from it.

05:57.108 --> 06:00.771
There was not a city of any kind at College Station. 
or any surrounding residential areas. The

06:04.162 --> 06:18.740
professors almost totally, when possible, lived 
on the campus in houses furnished by the

06:04.162 --> 06:18.740
university, by the college as it was called then. 
Other workers lived in Brown,

06:31.463 --> 06:36.291
The primary access was what is now called College 
Road. It was a county road that

06:37.913 --> 06:47.048
went on out there and automobiles were used to some 
extent. But automobiles were not generally owned

06:48.470 --> 06:54.039
or very popular in the early 1920s. They were just 
beginning to be used.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.683
on a utilitarian basis. Up to that time, they had 
been pretty well playthings or sports things. Did

07:10.911 --> 07:12.574
they ever have trolley trains here? Yes. There was 
an electric interurban railroad that ran from the

07:13.495 --> 07:32.301
Ursuline Academy, which is basically northeast, 
on the northeast edge of Bryan, or the eastern edge

07:13.495 --> 07:32.301
of Bryan, which is no longer there. down Ursuline 
Avenue, as it's called, and thence into downtown

07:33.918 --> 08:03.233
Bryan, thence out College Avenue, which

07:33.918 --> 08:03.233
is now partially Texas Avenue, to what now is 
called the Y, where actually Texas Avenue goes

07:33.918 --> 08:03.233
south and east and College Road goes south, and

08:03.618 --> 08:30.064
about where Woodson Lumber Company now situated 
and at that point the Interurban Railroad track

08:03.618 --> 08:30.064
took off cross country to Texas A&M University and 
stopped or had the station at the north what is now

08:03.618 --> 08:30.064
the north gate of Texas A&M and the right of way The 
route that it followed is now Cabot Avenue. In

08:35.956 --> 08:46.385
fact, the right-of-way that was owned by the 
Interurban Railroad was acquired by the city of

08:35.956 --> 08:46.385
Brown to use as a street. When did it cease to run its 
route? I never know that there was a... About 1922.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.017
It ceased? was having difficulty, and I believe 
finally switched over totally to buses in 1927.

09:08.136 --> 09:20.830
That's kind of off the top of my head, but I believe 
that finally went totally to a bus system in 1927.

09:20.870 --> 09:24.614
The buses ran more or less the same way? No, the 
buses ran, of course, on the streets that were

09:24.634 --> 09:29.599
available. How large was the city when Perth came 
under it? Do you have any idea? I would say about

09:36.859 --> 09:43.046
5,000 people in 1920. Was it mainly around what is 
now the downtown area?

09:48.813 --> 09:58.624
No, I don't know just how to describe it, but it was 
about in the same... to a degree the same

09:59.819 --> 10:22.047
confirmation as it is now with the exception of all 
of the tremendous residential growth that has

09:59.819 --> 10:22.047
occurred along Highway 6 which has become Texas 
Avenue and to the east, south and east of that.

10:32.489 --> 10:35.933
What were the main business areas? What? What were 
the main business areas? Has it been downtown most

10:38.355 --> 10:41.379
of the time? Yes, Main Street and the courthouse 
area was the main business area at that time. What

10:50.368 --> 10:55.594
has been the main business area?

11:06.273 --> 11:21.729
Well, of course, in the very beginning, the 
agricultural enterprise of the area was the

11:06.273 --> 11:21.729
primary business. The cotton in the valley? Well, 
both on the hill and in the valley, too. I mean,

11:28.035 --> 11:32.179
there was a tremendous outbreak of cotton all over 
the country along about World War I days when they

11:33.543 --> 11:43.055
were seeking the cellulose of cotton to make 
gunpowder. And this continued until about 1925

11:43.075 --> 12:02.318
when there was a combination of a market crash and a 
drought and crop failure and I don't know what all

11:43.075 --> 12:02.318
and it's been somewhat declining since that time 
according to my visualization.

12:08.356 --> 12:36.760
I could not categorize and it would not be correct 
in my mind to say that Texas A&M University has been

12:08.356 --> 12:36.760
the business of the main business of Bryan but I 
don't think there's ever been any doubt of what

12:08.356 --> 12:36.760
the funds that have been used or the funds that were 
brought into the area by the Texas A&M College and

12:37.280 --> 12:56.557
its affiliated agencies and have been expended 
here have certainly constituted a major portion

12:37.280 --> 12:56.557
of the economic base of the community.

13:00.601 --> 13:05.565
Do you think that the university has contributed 
more Oh, I think

13:06.187 --> 13:18.725
that there's no question. I think all business 
research studies and everything will show that

13:18.825 --> 13:34.827
the

13:18.825 --> 13:34.827
so-called local expenditures of the university 
is the largest, by many millions of dollars, the

13:35.330 --> 13:49.003
largest injection

13:35.330 --> 13:49.003
of funds into the economy in the community. And of 
course, and that doesn't, of course, they

13:49.023 --> 13:58.952
multiply themselves through the use of 
individual people.

14:01.935 --> 14:03.396
I may get back to what you were talking about. Where 
did you go to school? What school? Baylor

14:05.589 --> 14:07.150
University at Waco. Okay, I mean, beginning with 
the elementary school and the high school. Well,

14:11.115 --> 14:14.318
there were only two. The present Bowie School was 
called the Westside Elementary School, and the

14:14.458 --> 14:30.396
present Fannin School

14:14.458 --> 14:30.396
was called the Eastside Elementary School and 
Brown High School. Yes, no, the high school was on

14:31.490 --> 14:41.821
where Fannin is now, and was located in the same 
building as there. And incidentally, that's the

14:41.841 --> 14:53.774
same property that the first school ever built in 
Bryan was on, on that property at the corner of the

14:41.841 --> 14:53.774
29th and Baker. That was the portion of the city 
that was set aside for a school by the Texas Town Lot

15:01.848 --> 15:08.716
Company that originally surveyed the city. I went 
on and did both my undergraduate work and my

15:08.936 --> 15:17.245
graduate law work at Baylor. After

15:17.886 --> 15:29.479
I got to Baylor.

15:29.499 --> 15:30.420
Oh yes, I I'm very proud of my profession.

15:39.561 --> 15:46.350
Very few people, I think, can get a proper 
perspective of what the practice of law is about.

15:47.852 --> 15:52.057
But what we are actually engaged in is the 
administration of justice. And I assure you that

15:53.579 --> 15:59.186
no society can long exist without it. Now, whether 
or not We're doing it acceptably at this time,

16:00.472 --> 16:19.701
might be argued on an individual basis, but

16:00.472 --> 16:19.701
we have no other way to settle controversy between 
individual members of our society.

16:23.747 --> 16:28.133
And that has to be provided in some form.

16:31.302 --> 16:41.493
When you were growing up and now, has there ever 
been a lot of crime running on the station, or has it

16:31.302 --> 16:41.493
been mostly small publics and things like that? 
Has there ever been a great quantity

16:41.513 --> 16:46.178
of crime? If it was, I was not aware of it.

16:51.644 --> 16:56.770
We certainly

16:51.644 --> 16:56.770
had...

17:00.192 --> 17:15.699
crime from time to time, but

17:00.192 --> 17:15.699
I was simply not conscious of it, though I was not 
protected from it, not as an adult, and in a small

17:00.192 --> 17:15.699
town, of course, not even as a child. Has there ever 
been any, I don't really know how to put it, civil

17:17.822 --> 17:24.073
rights with the black minority in Bryan. Any 
trouble with that here at all? Have you ever felt

17:29.097 --> 17:33.581
any trouble in Bryan over that issue?

17:38.186 --> 17:39.627
No. Certainly there have been petitions and 
discussions more recently. By that I mean in the

17:46.153 --> 17:48.776
last 20 years. But...

17:59.997 --> 18:28.654
it's very difficult to communicate and of course

17:59.997 --> 18:28.654
i assume that any real militant militant could 
attack us but in truth in fact

17:59.997 --> 18:28.654
we have always had according to my

17:59.997 --> 18:28.654
uh evaluation

18:31.267 --> 18:48.632
a rather

18:31.267 --> 18:48.632
responsible and sensitive group of people in both 
what is now referred to as the white community and

18:31.267 --> 18:48.632
the black community.

18:50.735 --> 18:59.367
When I first came to Bryan, well, the so-called 
Negro Elementary School was located on

19:00.494 --> 19:04.059
Washington Avenue.

19:07.063 --> 19:17.237
It was called Washington School and maybe it was on 
Houston Street, but it was a very attractive

19:07.063 --> 19:17.237
building. It had won two National Architectural 
Awards and was really a building and that was

19:28.979 --> 19:35.185
superior to, equal to, or superior to the other 
elementary schools.

19:39.188 --> 19:45.954
Shortly, as it became necessary, the Kemp High 
School was built. And we simply did not have second

19:45.974 --> 19:56.304
grade schools for the black community here. Brian 
was very fortunate. has been in both the white and

19:57.886 --> 20:25.142
the black area in that

19:57.886 --> 20:25.142
in about 1919 they purchased the electric 
utilities for the specific purpose of financing

19:57.886 --> 20:25.142
the schools

19:57.886 --> 20:25.142
and a lot of people don't know it now but of course 
state financing and federal funding was not

19:57.886 --> 20:25.142
available until 1948 when the Gilmer-Akin bill 
was first passed in Texas. And during the

20:32.867 --> 20:55.028
so-called Depression of 1929 through about 1934, 
virtually

20:32.867 --> 20:55.028
all the school districts, not just in Texas but in 
the United States, could not pay any, they had no

20:32.867 --> 20:55.028
money to pay anybody anyway. They paid in what was 
called script, which was just a promissory note

20:56.138 --> 21:05.531
that someday if they got some money, they'd pay. 
People just had to survive as best they could. But

21:10.358 --> 21:23.496
because of the electric utility funding in Bryan, 
well, there was cash money available. pay

21:24.100 --> 21:34.377
teachers, and as a consequence, the ability to 
recruit the top quality was remarkable.

21:34.817 --> 21:38.243
During that same period of time, the state of Texas 
couldn't pay any salary. The state employees

21:39.425 --> 21:47.458
received script, but not the teachers at A&M 
because they were being paid out of the public

21:48.923 --> 21:54.388
school funds, which came from the public lands of 
Texas, the public school lands. But regular state

21:55.289 --> 22:00.754
offices got paid in script. Those that were 
dependent upon tax revenue, because nobody paid

22:00.774 --> 22:07.340
any taxes in that period of time. Well, supposedly 
they didn't. But in any event,

22:10.543 --> 22:18.711
this built a tremendous stack of teachers and 
particularly in the black schools

22:19.332 --> 22:48.310
and we have just always had real

22:19.332 --> 22:48.310
good communications between whites and blacks 
here I feel and we had good schools perhaps not as

22:19.332 --> 22:48.310
good as they should have been I don't know but I know 
that They were certainly not downgraded or

22:48.745 --> 22:51.629
disregarded. And we integrated our high school 
here, I believe, within

22:53.552 --> 23:06.890
a year after Brown v. School Board was decided. 
Because I was a member of the school board, and I

23:08.232 --> 23:18.145
took a copy of the Supreme Court opinion that Brown 
v. School Board distributed to my fellow members.

23:18.901 --> 23:47.642
told him i said i mean there was a lot of talk at that 
time it's not going to be i mean over the south they

23:18.901 --> 23:47.642
were saying well we're not going to do it and all 
like that i told him i said forget about it it's here

23:18.901 --> 23:47.642
it has already happened there's no arguing with it 
so we ought to get with it and we started attempting

23:18.901 --> 23:47.642
to identify at that time black students in the 
black system that could, without any difficulty

23:48.061 --> 24:08.992
or problem to themselves, move into the Stephen F. 
Austin High School was called in and started doing

23:48.061 --> 24:08.992
it.

24:09.012 --> 24:16.903
We were in the process of integrating the high 
school here long before many, many, many places

24:09.012 --> 24:16.903
even gave it any consideration. Also, black 
people have always been able to borrow money in

24:18.385 --> 24:24.973
this community. That's something that very few 
people know about. I don't ever remember a time

24:28.437 --> 24:35.847
that a responsible black individual couldn't 
obtain bank credit, the very best credit. He

24:35.867 --> 24:41.033
didn't have to go to a backstreet shyster loan 
company. He could go talk to the chief loan officer

24:41.053 --> 24:46.640
of any bank in this community. I've seen it happen 
many, many times. I know that I have waited in line

24:50.363 --> 25:04.175
to see a loan officer while blacks preceded me, and 
it was not offensive to me, and as far as I know, it

24:50.363 --> 25:04.175
was never offensive to anyone. I know what's now 
the first banking for us was the first state bank.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.442
It was located here on Main Street. The building's 
still standing. Right inside the main door was a

25:14.684 --> 25:19.948
very long wooden settee and it was referred to here 
as the mourners bench and then Mr. Higgs and Mr.

25:21.599 --> 25:49.767
Delaney the two vice presidents and the main loan 
officers of the bank sat right there immediately

25:21.599 --> 25:49.767
visible to everyone behind a rail and the 
customary practice and everybody did it was to go

25:21.599 --> 25:49.767
in and take your place in line on the mourners bench 
or stand in line and then Man at the head of the bench

25:49.898 --> 25:52.861
went next. Well, my family owned substantial 
stock in the bank. In fact, my uncle was the

25:58.267 --> 26:01.451
president of it. Did not have offices in it. But I 
transacted my business like that, just like

26:03.933 --> 26:11.241
everybody else, and it was not... I mean, it was 
just normal. The bond building and loan from the

26:14.365 --> 26:17.188
day it was organized. has always accepted 
applications and from black people for loans for

26:17.725 --> 26:47.665
the building of homes and has has always had a 
tremendous part of its clientele were

26:17.725 --> 26:47.665
responsible black people that could qualify for 
loans so i think these things contributed

26:17.725 --> 26:47.665
i mean

26:17.725 --> 26:47.665
it created good communications It's

26:47.847 --> 26:57.364
always seemed to me that there's been very good 
relations. I've lived here since probably 57. And

26:59.247 --> 27:03.855
I've never noticed any trouble whatsoever. There 
have been places, there'd be a fight or something

27:03.875 --> 27:09.005
like that, but that happens everywhere. But it 
always seems that everyone gets along pretty

27:09.025 --> 27:11.509
well. well i think there are reasons for that and i 
think they were built in many many many years ago

27:13.649 --> 27:42.238
but uh the uh

27:13.649 --> 27:42.238
like the primary thing was that

27:13.649 --> 27:42.238
i guess that there was just real good 
communications that primarily that the that it

27:42.640 --> 27:51.992
was an open society, that blacks

27:42.640 --> 27:51.992
were never closed off as such. Certainly, I mean, 
they followed the, our social patterns were

27:52.012 --> 28:05.408
identically the same as they were everywhere else 
in the United

27:52.012 --> 28:05.408
States.
