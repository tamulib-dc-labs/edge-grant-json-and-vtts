WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:02.845
Yeah, it is. She did a good job. Okay, this is Ron 
Shoring in Kingsville, Texas, interviewing Don

00:05.348 --> 00:11.215
Yeomans. Don, for the record, what's your name and 
date and place of birth? Donald Keith Yeomans. I

00:18.343 --> 00:23.069
was born in Rochester, New York, May 3, 1942. How'd 
you get interested in astronomy? Well, I don't

00:26.252 --> 00:31.118
think it started until I was... halfway through my 
undergraduate career at the Middlebury College

00:32.870 --> 00:37.057
in Vermont. And I took an undergraduate course in 
astronomy from my professor, who turned out to be

00:37.217 --> 00:47.934
very contagious and his enthusiasm for 
astronomy. I think it started there, really. So I

00:49.496 --> 00:56.447
had been taking math as an undergraduate and have a 
math major. But I took a number of physics courses

00:56.467 --> 01:01.054
after that and astronomy, and then went on the 
University of Maryland to do graduate school

01:01.878 --> 01:04.681
work. Why did you pick Maryland? Well, they had an 
excellent program.

01:12.588 --> 01:19.495
I interviewed with a number of schools, but 
Maryland had an excellent program. They offered

01:19.515 --> 01:30.906
me more money, and they were one of the closer 
schools to where I was living in Rochester.

01:31.544 --> 01:42.039
What was your specialty in, I mean your specialty 
is commons now, but was it when you were grad

01:31.544 --> 01:42.039
student? At the University of Maryland we were,

01:42.059 --> 01:57.602
everyone took a lot of radio astronomy, 
astrophysics, solar astronomy,

01:57.937 --> 02:01.861
almost everything except what I finally wound up 
in, which was dynamical astronomy. So we had a very

02:01.881 --> 02:08.468
broad background in most of the astronomical 
subjects. My dynamical work really was done by

02:08.488 --> 02:24.306
Peter Musen at the Goddard Space Flight Center, 
who was sort of an adjunct professor at the

02:08.488 --> 02:24.306
University of Maryland, and he taught a number of 
us several years of dynamical astronomy. What was

02:24.526 --> 02:25.547
your thesis on? It was on the non-gravitational 
forces on the comets. Jacques Beniziner was the

02:31.093 --> 02:34.981
example I used. But I developed numerical 
integration routines and differential

02:35.001 --> 02:43.300
correction routines to determine the cometary 
orbits. and including the so-called

02:44.140 --> 02:54.295
non-gravitational effects, which had recently 
been detected by Brian Martin in the motions of

02:44.140 --> 02:54.295
many of his comments. Well, they weren't recently 
detected. Actually, they were detected way back

02:56.318 --> 02:57.860
when. Ain't thinking. But Brian had recently 
modeled those in a fairly comprehensive fashion.

03:07.495 --> 03:11.160
So I used that model and then predicted some meteor 
showers for that particular comet. The

03:13.266 --> 03:18.016
draconids, of course, meteor showers are 
associated with that kind of thing. So I went back

03:18.036 --> 03:26.914
and investigated the circumstances of the 
previous shower phenomena and went ahead and made

03:18.036 --> 03:26.914
predictions for the future. How did they turn out? 
Well, predicting meteor showers is a whole lot

03:30.401 --> 03:33.587
different than predicting the return of the 
continents. We thought there would be quite a

03:39.571 --> 03:44.659
substantial shower in 1955.

03:47.023 --> 03:48.124
There was not. Almost exactly a century after the 
failure of 1865. Yeah. So I have since gotten away

03:53.492 --> 04:03.287
from meteor shower prediction, pretty much, and 
stuck with trying to predict the motions in the

03:53.492 --> 04:03.287
last two weeks of college. When did you, by the way, 
when did you get your bachelor's and when did you

04:05.545 --> 04:10.532
get your PhD? I got the master's in 1967 and the PhD 
in 1970 at the University

04:11.533 --> 04:21.748
of Maryland. Where did you then go to work after you 
got your degree? Even as a graduate student, I was

04:26.375 --> 04:34.506
doing some work at the Goddard Space Flight 
Center, which is very close to the University of

04:26.375 --> 04:34.506
Maryland, of course. Again, working with Peter 
Musen doing some computations. And after

04:43.263 --> 04:51.531
graduating from the University of Maryland, I 
actually had a job briefly with the Bendix Field

04:43.263 --> 04:51.531
Engineering Corporation. They were contracting 
with Goddard. And later, with Computer Sciences

04:54.554 --> 05:00.961
Corporation, again, contracting for Goddard. 
And at both places, I was really working Bob

05:04.507 --> 05:18.740
Farquhar, who now is at the Applied Physics Lab, 
but his interest then, and in fact now, is fly-by

05:04.507 --> 05:18.740
missions to comets and asteroids. And so I started 
off working in the field that I'd been trained in,

05:18.760 --> 05:25.026
which is sort of unusual. And I've been doing the 
motions of comets and asteroids primarily for for

05:33.667 --> 05:39.234
mission analysis work and mission planning ever 
since. After those couple of short stints, where

05:39.274 --> 05:42.618
did you go? In 1976, I was asked by Lou Friedman to 
come out to the Depth Propulsion Laboratory,

05:42.638 --> 05:54.753
which I did, and I've been there ever since. Do you 
think planetary astronomy is real astronomy? or

06:02.995 --> 06:04.257
planetary science? Well, I certainly do, yes. But 
I think your question derives from the fact that

06:07.442 --> 06:16.756
the majority of the astronaut community probably 
doesn't feel that way. I was going to ask you that.

06:21.723 --> 06:27.612
That's certainly been the universal, I've 
interviewed 30 people in the whole 30 degrees. Do

06:27.772 --> 06:32.479
you think, in the time since you've been in the 
field,

06:35.092 --> 06:42.042
the situation has gotten better and planetary 
astronomy has a better holder among stellar and

06:35.092 --> 06:42.042
galactic astronomers than you see? I think it 
does, yes. And why? Well, I was just going to say,

06:45.246 --> 06:56.122
primarily because of NASA and the exploration, 
planetary exploration program within NASA.

06:56.723 --> 07:00.508
Planetary astronomy very much holds its own, 
especially with Well, but the perception, I

07:01.822 --> 07:05.709
think, is strong. I think it's at least an equal 
footing now.

07:10.557 --> 07:16.868
And perhaps I just want a little bit to quote the 
monetary strongest side, at least from my very

07:10.557 --> 07:16.868
biased point of view. When you were getting 
started, did you feel inferior to, say, people who

07:17.088 --> 07:26.985
observed the 200-inch galaxy? My background 
really was not smack in the middle of planetary

07:27.320 --> 07:31.746
astronomy. It was sort of halfway between 
planetary astronomy and dynamical astronomy. So

07:37.654 --> 07:52.914
I never had the impression that I was inferior to 
the stellar astronomers because I never

07:37.654 --> 07:52.914
considered myself a traditional astronomer in 
the first place. My discipline was halfway

07:52.934 --> 07:57.040
between planetary astronomy and dynamical 
astronomy. So I really never had that perception

07:57.880 --> 08:02.966
or that feeling. Here's a question that I know you 
know the answer to, and I do too. But it seems that in

08:07.892 --> 08:18.004
the 20s, 30s, and 40s, when very little serious 
astrophysics was done in the solar system, the

08:07.892 --> 08:18.004
comets were immune for this. The cometary papers 
would appear in the anthrax. Is that, am I correct

08:22.189 --> 08:24.853
in saying that? Yeah, I think that's true. There 
was some excellent work done by spectroscopists,

08:26.720 --> 08:33.428
as you well know, in the 40s.

08:36.391 --> 08:43.919
And even prior to that, the spectroscopy of 
meteors was important work. Well, comets,

08:43.940 --> 08:54.972
I think, have always retained sort of a mysterious

08:43.940 --> 08:54.972
bent to them. Any information that could be 
gleaned using astrophysical techniques was

08:55.390 --> 09:00.254
applied. They did work on polarization studies of 
comets and spectroscopic work, electric work,

09:00.274 --> 09:07.280
infrared.

09:10.863 --> 09:20.091
Whenever a new technique was developed, it wasn't 
long before they would apply it to comets as well as

09:10.863 --> 09:20.091
some other astrophysical objects. I'd like to ask 
you your opinions about some things relating to

09:20.111 --> 09:24.655
comets. When do you think photometry became good 
enough to actually tell us something about the

09:25.293 --> 09:41.800
comet?

09:45.644 --> 09:53.151
Well, I think there was some excellent work done in 
the late 19th century, really. I think that's when

09:53.171 --> 09:57.074
it started.

09:57.094 --> 10:15.111
There were a series of photometric observations 
made of comets, and that data is often used even

09:57.094 --> 10:15.111
today in an effort to discern whether comets are 
fading as a function of time or whether they're

10:16.559 --> 10:37.690
Spectroscopy

10:38.480 --> 10:48.853
Continuous spectra, continuous spectra, 
however the photography came in and showed

10:38.480 --> 10:48.853
Brown-Huckaboo and certainly confirmed the 
polarization work that showed the polar dust. And

10:49.233 --> 10:54.700
then, of course, the first, I guess, Huggins saw 
emission law. But for a long time it was held up, I

10:54.720 --> 11:04.292
guess, because, in fact, a lot of mechanics hadn't 
been invented and people didn't know what to make.

11:04.332 --> 11:04.753
That's right. Yeah, that's true. There was a lot of 
spectroscopic work done, again, in the late 19th

11:08.180 --> 11:18.153
century, early 20th century, but apart from a 
couple of initial breakthroughs where they, was

11:08.180 --> 11:18.153
it C2? Yeah. And that was, you mentioned that 
Huggins was lucky, or is it you? Well, that's true.

11:24.121 --> 11:36.938
I didn't mention it, but yeah, the C2 lines were 
some of the, a couple of the lines that he actually

11:24.121 --> 11:36.938
could identify without any knowledge of the, And 
he did. He actually had a carbon arc made through

11:40.623 --> 11:54.828
the telescope, and he practically analyzed that 
and looked at some emission lines from Comets and

11:40.623 --> 11:54.828
correctly identified these lines as due to 
carbon. But that was the exception. As you noted,

11:56.847 --> 12:09.622
the quantum mechanics didn't come in until the 
very 20th century, and it was then that all of these

11:56.847 --> 12:09.622
spectral lines and bands that have been noted were 
properly identified. You've done this in your

12:09.642 --> 12:13.287
book, but this is for the record. Could you kind of 
give a short summary of how cometary astronomy

12:13.307 --> 12:24.981
developed from, say, 1860 Well, in terms of 
motions

12:25.417 --> 12:54.090
of comets, you noted that Encke detected these 
so-called non-gravitational effects in the

12:25.417 --> 12:54.090
early 19th century with the comet that now bears 
his name, and of course he initially attributed

12:25.417 --> 12:54.090
this to the the drag effects of the ether. And so 
that was a bit of a backwards step. And that result

13:01.772 --> 13:15.972
was so well verified and in place that the notion of 
this interplanetary ether continued well into

13:01.772 --> 13:15.972
the late 19th century because of that. So that was a 
bit of a step backwards. Another step backwards, I

13:18.956 --> 13:24.364
think, was the, well, An unfortunate

13:25.559 --> 13:45.825
relationship between the observed meteor 
showers in the 1860s, the Leonids and Perseids

13:25.559 --> 13:45.825
were identified by Schiaparelli and a few others 
as being due to their parent comets, the Comet

13:25.559 --> 13:45.825
Swift tunnel, the Temple Tunnel. And this 
association between meteor streams and comets

13:47.147 --> 13:55.498
sort of evolved into the flying dust bank model of a 
comet. And that was unfortunate. The association

13:58.940 --> 14:01.964
of meteor streams with comets was very fortunate. 
That was a major step forward. But the further

14:03.426 --> 14:20.507
inference that somehow comets were clouds of 
particles flying in formation was a notion that

14:03.426 --> 14:20.507
held center stage to the 1950 high-speed 
conglomerate model.

14:24.605 --> 14:54.325
Then there was some

14:24.605 --> 14:54.325
work done

14:24.605 --> 14:54.325
in the 1900s and 1901

14:24.605 --> 14:54.325
on light pressure and the fact that light pressure 
could affect dust particles. Of course, Amelia

14:55.047 --> 15:06.141
Lynn lends itself to the notion of dust-tales 
being formed by the pressure of sunlight. It

15:06.161 --> 15:14.592
wasn't until many years later that the correct 
explanation for the ion-tales was denoted as, for

15:06.161 --> 15:14.592
many years, light pressure was vibrated, for the 
most part. was applied in an attempt to explain the

15:15.162 --> 15:21.070
Type I, Type II, and Type III tails. Now, the Type I 
was the dust tail, and the Type II tails were the ion

15:21.090 --> 15:28.581
tails. But, of course, he lumped them together and 
tried to explain both with light pressure and, of

15:28.601 --> 15:37.153
course, was unsuccessful. at least the type 1 dust 
tails were

15:37.420 --> 16:01.943
successfully explained by the pressure of 
sunlight and it wasn't until the solar wind notion

15:37.420 --> 16:01.943
was put forward by Biermann and also around 1950

15:37.420 --> 16:01.943
that the charge exchange mechanism between 
cometary ions and the solar plasma

16:02.632 --> 16:25.319
fails radiating outward from the sun at 400 
kilometers a second was successfully used to

16:02.632 --> 16:25.319
explain the ion fails. You had mentioned the 
emission lines from the spectra were noted as

16:25.339 --> 16:28.062
early as, I think it was 1880s, 1860s, 1870s, 
1880s. Emission lines, emission bands were

16:28.082 --> 16:30.765
detected and it was generally assumed that these 
were,

16:31.218 --> 16:57.859
well, some of them were carbon and were identified 
as such, but most of them were simply noted as

16:31.218 --> 16:57.859
mysterious

16:31.218 --> 16:57.859
features that couldn't be identified chemically 
because the quantum mechanics hadn't been

16:31.218 --> 16:57.859
invented yet. Now, in terms of there

17:01.947 --> 17:20.609
was all kinds of attempts to do this 
photometrically, but the problem there was that

17:01.947 --> 17:20.609
the dust contamination to the photometric 
solutions was always a problem, and so these

17:01.947 --> 17:20.609
things were considered to be far larger than they 
really were. Elizabeth Romer did some

17:21.991 --> 17:29.440
interesting work back in the 60s where she very 
carefully tried to subtract, or she took and

17:29.858 --> 17:53.652
derived

17:29.858 --> 17:53.652
some fairly decent estimates for the sizes of the 
nucleons themselves, but even her estimates

17:29.858 --> 17:53.652
were somewhat contaminated by the dust. And it 
really wasn't until the 70s when there was a

17:53.672 --> 17:55.495
reasonable estimate And pretty much they lie in 
the range from 5 to 10 to 20 kilometers, that range.

18:05.739 --> 18:11.464
I have a personal bone to pick, so I'll pick it. 
Well, not pick, but to emphasize. A long time

18:13.226 --> 18:25.718
before they identified water vapor as a major 
constituent of comets, for some time before, it

18:13.226 --> 18:25.718
became kind of popular to think that they were, 
even though we didn't have the evidence. Do you

18:26.812 --> 18:31.780
remember when that happened, or did you find it out 
when you were working on your book? Well, of

18:33.182 --> 18:44.260
course, Fred Whipple, in his model of 1950, 
postulated water is one of the major icy

18:33.182 --> 18:44.260
constituents that warms methane and ammonia. 
Now, the next step forward in terms of water ice, I

18:44.280 --> 18:53.595
think, was taken with the the 
above-the-atmosphere rocket flight, they were

18:54.233 --> 19:03.842
doing ultraviolet observations of the enormous 
clouds of hydrogen surrounding these clouds.

19:03.922 --> 19:13.431
That was a big surprise to everyone, just to see how 
large these clouds of light and alpha clouds of

19:03.922 --> 19:13.431
hydrogen were. And, of course, it wasn't that big a 
leap to note that one way of getting these enormous

19:13.451 --> 19:20.578
clouds of hydrogen to

19:22.162 --> 19:45.416
vaporize water and ionize it. So that was another 
step toward water and vaporizing. And then there

19:46.518 --> 19:49.282
was some, of course, the commonality of flybys, 
maybe six of the others, because they directly

19:46.518 --> 19:49.282
observed water vaporization. But there were some 
pretty strong hints even before that, well before

19:49.302 --> 19:51.325
that, about water vaporization. How

19:51.895 --> 20:05.735
would you contrast planetary astronomy in 1970 
with what

19:51.895 --> 20:05.735
it is today in 1974? Well, in 1970, I just got out of 
school, and it was sort of the Apollo program

20:05.855 --> 20:17.212
that had pumped a lot of interest and a lot of money 
into the field. And so it was the heyday. It wasn't

20:18.233 --> 20:20.316
the last day. In

20:21.730 --> 20:47.855
the

20:21.730 --> 20:47.855
70s, there

20:21.730 --> 20:47.855
was

20:21.730 --> 20:47.855
a wave of enthusiasm

20:21.730 --> 20:47.855
because of . There's no question . when

20:50.047 --> 21:14.067
you're riding the coattails. To a certain extent, 
planetary astronomy isn't riding the coattails

21:14.087 --> 21:16.089
of manned space like even today. But I think the 
Apollo program certainly sparked it. And then the

21:17.170 --> 21:19.171
Viking missions were exciting because of the hope 
of finding some sort of life on Mars. The Voyager

21:19.191 --> 21:19.952
program was extraordinary. of

21:21.434 --> 21:45.256
each

21:21.434 --> 21:45.256
new planet

21:21.434 --> 21:45.256
as the Voyagers want to have . But the Vikings and 
the Voyagers are come and gone, and now we're back

21:45.276 --> 21:49.500
to almost where we were prior to the Apollo 
program, not in terms of , but in terms of not having

21:45.276 --> 21:49.500
any major missions to explore except for . What

21:49.818 --> 22:06.786
do you think the state of planetary astronomy 
today is, and what's your guess for the immediate

21:49.818 --> 22:06.786
future, the next five or ten years? Well,

22:07.847 --> 22:16.922
I'm not too confident that the next five or ten 
years, frankly, From my limited point of view,

22:17.932 --> 22:32.311
being at JPL, there is Cassini,

22:17.932 --> 22:32.311
which is supporting a quarter of the laboratory.

22:32.331 --> 22:42.124
And there seems to be a perception, really, that 
we're going now into smaller emissions,

22:32.331 --> 22:42.124
hopefully more frequently. Smaller, better, 
faster, cheaper. The motto that Stan Gold has been

22:47.058 --> 23:08.996
And

22:47.058 --> 23:08.996
so

22:47.058 --> 23:08.996
from JPL's point of view, where we once had a 
monopoly, of course, that's no longer the case. So

23:09.016 --> 23:10.338
you've got universities participating in the 
discovery program. You've got APL. You've got DOD

23:10.678 --> 23:11.580
participating in some of that. So in terms of a JPL 
employee in planetary science, it's going to be a

23:12.775 --> 23:21.643
little rough. Going back 25 years ago, there was

23:23.104 --> 23:35.876
no such journal as the American Astronomical 
Society, or I should say 30 years ago, and there was

23:23.104 --> 23:35.876
no division for planetary sciences. Now 
planetary workers have their own journals and

23:35.896 --> 23:41.601
their own division of the American Astronomical 
Society. Do you think those two developments,

23:42.037 --> 23:52.591
both as it relates to planetary astronomy and 
astronomy in general, were good, bad, or just

23:42.037 --> 23:52.591
inevitable? Oh, they're very good and 
inevitable.

23:58.378 --> 24:00.421
The Division of Planetary Sciences is extremely 
active. It's by far my favorite

24:00.441 --> 24:09.192
meeting, even more interesting to me than this 
one, the Division of Planetary Sciences, DPS

24:10.302 --> 24:33.750
encompasses

24:10.302 --> 24:33.750
not only dynamics, but it has physics, you have 
spectroscopy, you have words, you have dynamics.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.452
It's a great place to get together with people with 
diverse backgrounds. It's marvelous. And I'm

24:35.792 --> 24:36.553
extremely well-attended to it. It's huge. It's 
very private. And Icarus, likewise, has done a

24:37.174 --> 24:38.115
marvelous job. Where

24:38.956 --> 25:06.297
do you think planetary science would be today in 
the USA? I hesitate

25:08.082 --> 25:25.815
to think where we would be

25:08.082 --> 25:25.815
without

25:08.082 --> 25:25.815
NASA. Again, the Apollo program, I think, kicked 
us into high gear. In fact, you could make an

25:27.498 --> 25:31.305
argument for NASA, the space program, actually 
giving birth to the planetary science community

25:27.498 --> 25:31.305
up in North America. As

25:32.737 --> 26:02.355
you're

25:32.737 --> 26:02.355
probably aware, before there was a NASA A fair 
amount of research was sponsored by the

26:03.736 --> 26:15.812
Department of Defense, Stellar and Galactic 
Astronomy by the Office of Naval Research, but

26:03.736 --> 26:15.812
planetary and lunar was by the Air Force. There's 
talk of doing away with NASA. What would your

26:20.398 --> 26:24.843
opinion be of working for the Air Force? Actually, 
I am working for the Air Force. At the moment, I have

26:26.826 --> 26:33.034
a small contract working on Dave Rappaport's 
summer development for common ground. I don't

26:33.233 --> 26:42.949
think

26:33.233 --> 26:42.949
that would be a healthy situation. The Air Force 
really

26:42.969 --> 26:57.632
has a

26:42.969 --> 26:57.632
very limited interest in monetary science and 
science in general. I don't see that being an

26:57.652 --> 26:58.313
option. doing away with NASA and transferring

26:58.850 --> 27:12.527
it to Air Force or whatever DOD branches would be 
very wise. How do you think NASA handles

27:12.547 --> 27:18.354
management today and when you first started 
thinking about it or experiencing it? Well, the

27:18.374 --> 27:24.702
management of scientific contracts. Oh, I see. 
Well, I've had a contract with NASA. under the rtop

27:28.381 --> 27:58.320
program i've never had a problem there's always 
the problem that the money available is far

27:28.381 --> 27:58.320
less than what is required

27:28.381 --> 27:58.320
but that's a continual problem because even if the 
money doesn't decrease the number of people

27:28.381 --> 27:58.320
buying that thing is increasing The

27:59.482 --> 28:16.921
science management at NASA has been, in my opinion 
at least, pretty good. I suspect that's not a

28:16.941 --> 28:17.902
popular opinion. I may be the only one holding that 
opinion, but I have never had a problem with the

28:17.922 --> 28:23.869
review of the proposals,

28:27.697 --> 28:37.970
I've

28:27.697 --> 28:37.970
had a very positive reaction.

28:40.854 --> 28:46.181
All right, we've visited all the planets with 
Pluto at least once now. We got to look at their

28:46.201 --> 28:48.364
satellites and so forth. And no trace of life or 
anything approaching it has been found anywhere

28:48.384 --> 28:55.493
in the solar system except Earth. Do you think this 
has had an impressing effect on public interest

28:55.827 --> 29:05.180
and budgets for quantitary sites, or not? Well, 
initially there was a great deal of talk about

29:05.200 --> 29:21.081
finding a place on Mars, and I think that fueled a 
lot of the public interest that led to the

29:05.200 --> 29:21.081
successful biking and the Voyager program. But I 
think that the population is sophisticated

29:22.623 --> 29:24.906
enough to realize that that life is something 
that's prevalent on Mars or any of the planets that

29:26.624 --> 29:38.782
exist. I'd like to think they're educated enough 
to realize that, well, I like to turn it around,

29:38.802 --> 29:48.556
that why is it that life has been about Earth and 
hasn't yet been discovered anywhere else? That,

29:48.616 --> 29:53.684
to me, is everybody's exciting finding life 
elsewhere. The thought that we're possibly a

29:53.704 --> 29:55.787
fluke. of

29:56.341 --> 30:21.090
interstellar accidents

29:56.341 --> 30:21.090
is maybe more interesting ultimately than 
planning to land on Mars, which didn't happen. I

30:21.110 --> 30:24.154
think if we're going to relate, or try and regain 
the public interest in space, our efforts can't be

30:21.110 --> 30:24.154
focused upon life, because we're going to have to 
It's going

30:25.501 --> 30:52.672
to have to be

30:25.501 --> 30:52.672
the expansion

30:25.501 --> 30:52.672
of the discovery of new neighborhoods, new 
possibilities, doing this for the next

30:25.501 --> 30:52.672
generation, and finding new resources to explore 
the planetary realm first,

30:25.501 --> 30:52.672
and then out from there. So no, I don't think it's . 
Since

30:55.235 --> 31:17.715
we don't know if it's going to be an informed guess, 
do you think comments are leftovers from the

30:55.235 --> 31:17.715
formation of the solar system or have the ones we 
see now been somehow acquired by

30:55.235 --> 31:17.715
ourselves? The consensus view certainly is that 
comets are the leftover bits and pieces from the

31:18.809 --> 31:25.799
solar system formation process. I think that's 
probably the correct interpretation. If we were

31:30.025 --> 31:44.927
actively acquiring comets from elsewhere, we 
would see comets

31:30.025 --> 31:44.927
on parabolic

31:30.025 --> 31:44.927
orbits. We would see hyperbolic orbits. And we 
don't. We don't see hyperbolic orbits, strong

31:47.190 --> 31:48.512
anechoic orbits at all. So

31:49.252 --> 32:13.959
yeah, I think kind of the leftovers from the outer 
solar system formation process, I mean,

31:49.252 --> 32:13.959
chemically they're very similar to the outer 
planets. That's very good. Leftovers from the

32:14.339 --> 32:15.901
inner solar system formation process, they're 
very similar. I think that aspect is fairly well be

32:15.921 --> 32:16.862
the case. As

32:17.568 --> 32:31.166
you're well aware, the Division for Planetary 
Sciences is quite active in lobbying Congress. Do

32:31.186 --> 32:40.098
you think planetary astronomers have done a good 
job in presenting their case to Congress? I think

32:40.118 --> 32:47.187
they've started to lobby, and that's an excellent 
start, but we haven't done nearly as much. As you

32:49.192 --> 33:05.515
get older and more cynical, you realize that the 
views you held as a youth, that is, the science is so

32:49.192 --> 33:05.515
interesting and physically means that Congress 
will see our point of view and appropriate the

32:49.192 --> 33:05.515
necessary funds. It's simply too naive. It didn't 
work for higher-engine particle physicists,

33:07.998 --> 33:10.541
that's for sure. No, we have to get in there and we 
have to bang on doors. We have to mount... a

33:17.305 --> 33:24.797
write-in campaign for particular issues that we 
feel strongly about. We have to get to the

33:24.817 --> 33:30.105
representatives and make sure that they 
understand how we feel and just flex our muscles

33:24.817 --> 33:30.105
and throw our weight around it. It's the only way 
we're going to make any progress. Do you think

33:36.095 --> 33:41.203
Planetary Astronomers have done a good job in 
selling themselves to the public?

33:45.419 --> 34:03.231
It's

33:45.419 --> 34:03.231
almost as if astronomers and scientists don't 
have the time to share it with the people who are

33:45.419 --> 34:03.231
paying for their power. We really have dropped the 
ball on that part. We

34:04.859 --> 34:25.762
should be out there at the high schools doing 
talks. We should be out there at the adult clubs. We

34:26.643 --> 34:28.245
remain in the excitement of our science, the 
people who are paying the bills. And as a rule, the

34:28.265 --> 34:30.327
commons and scientists in general don't do that 
well, and they don't do it properly. We have guys

34:30.347 --> 34:31.328
like Carl Sagan who do it very well. But we have to 
get more of us out there. relay

34:34.930 --> 35:04.549
the excitement of our science to them and every 
time they give a talk we should thank them for the

34:34.930 --> 35:04.549
privilege of working for them they really have to 
do much here's a personal question what's the best

34:34.930 --> 35:04.549
piece of work well uh i guess it would have to be uh 
things not a particular thing but uh What we

35:05.052 --> 35:11.417
do at JPL within my little group is is

35:12.292 --> 35:34.898
when NASA wants to send

35:12.292 --> 35:34.898
a spacecraft by documentary center, by comet 
Halley, by asteroid Ida or Gaspra, they have to

35:12.292 --> 35:34.898
know where these objects are in space. So it's our 
job to get the necessary reference star catalogs

35:34.918 --> 35:38.822
to experience the observers, generate the 
orbital updates and the tremor adaptations and

35:34.918 --> 35:38.822
the air analyses that allow the spacecraft I think 
that's the

35:41.519 --> 35:57.701
thing I'm most proud of, is that for every object, 
for every comet and asteroid that a spacecraft has

35:41.519 --> 35:57.701
encountered, it was our efforts that told them 
where to, where the topics were. We've done a

35:57.721 --> 35:59.844
pretty good job so far. What was the most fun? I 
think working during the comet Halley and working

36:01.727 --> 36:05.552
with the Russians. the

36:06.292 --> 36:26.443
Soviets,

36:06.292 --> 36:26.443
as they went in, was a real eye-opener.

36:26.463 --> 36:30.610
And seeing the way they did business, contrasting 
it with the way we did business, and their

36:26.463 --> 36:30.610
facilities and computers versus ours, and their 
ideas versus ours, I thought that was

36:26.463 --> 36:30.610
fascinating. They really had a marvelous time. 
Ever had any misfires or dead ends? I

36:33.055 --> 36:54.728
was

36:33.055 --> 36:54.728
investigating the

36:33.055 --> 36:54.728
motion of asteroid Icarus in 1566. And we knew that 
it was affected by relativistic effects, of

36:54.748 --> 36:58.033
course, because it is such an elliptic orbit, it's 
such a small, so many directions, just like the

36:54.748 --> 36:58.033
sea. the

36:59.060 --> 37:18.105
orbit

36:59.060 --> 37:18.105
of Mercury rotates

36:59.060 --> 37:18.105
in terms of the gravitational effect, and so does 
the orbit of Mercury. And we had put those effects

37:18.125 --> 37:23.852
in our code, and we still had some problems with the 
observations, so we solved for some cometary

37:18.125 --> 37:23.852
non-gravitational effects, and that seemed to 
take care of things, and so we made the inference

37:18.125 --> 37:23.852
that, yes indeed, this is a comet that is still 
outgassing, and And

37:25.992 --> 37:43.236
that

37:25.992 --> 37:43.236
was why these effects were noticeable. Well, 
after publishing it, it turns out we had a bug in the

37:43.256 --> 37:45.920
program, and then the relativistic effects were 
not being applied at all. And once that bug was

37:45.940 --> 37:47.983
declared, the motion of the attitude was 
explained very well without any kind of When

37:49.094 --> 38:08.476
you're sitting on a plane or waiting in

37:49.094 --> 38:08.476
line or something, just an expert who's not a 
scientist, finds out what you do for a living,

37:49.094 --> 38:08.476
what's their attitude? Well,

38:08.496 --> 38:18.527
it's a little, I won't say they're awestruck, but 
the conversation seems to stop rather

38:18.777 --> 38:41.797
abruptly

38:18.777 --> 38:41.797
when they realized that this person was an 
astronomer. They know very little about it, and I

38:41.817 --> 38:43.499
guess they don't know what to talk about next. It's 
not a subject that the public is as well versed in,

38:43.519 --> 38:45.200
and that's another problem. We have to make an 
effort to get the public up to speed on astronomy

38:45.220 --> 38:47.282
and do fast-breaking science here. What's

38:47.600 --> 39:12.409
the most common question people

38:47.600 --> 39:12.409
ask you? They asked me a question about the 
astronomical topics

39:13.334 --> 39:30.921
they've read most recently in the newspaper.

39:33.905 --> 39:37.230
I mean, our science does get a fair amount of press, 
especially with respect to the other sciences,

39:33.905 --> 39:37.230
because there's always something new going on. A 
new quasar, or a new cometary phenomena, or a

39:37.250 --> 39:40.455
discovery of possible dark matter, There's 
always

39:41.617 --> 39:55.452
something exotic on the fringe that sort of brings 
a lot of media. That's what they usually ask about.

39:56.273 --> 39:57.454
The most recent discovery they read about in the 
newspaper. So it's imperative that we all, no

39:57.474 --> 40:07.084
matter what field we're in, that we all keep 
abreast of the entire astronomical

39:57.474 --> 40:07.084
literature. um

40:09.730 --> 40:31.671
that brings up the question of do you have much 
contact with stellar and galactic astronomy

40:09.730 --> 40:31.671
types not on a professional level hardly ever 
because i mean if you go to the dps You interact with

40:32.157 --> 40:42.391
planetary

40:32.157 --> 40:42.391
science. If you go to the AIS meeting, you interact 
with galactic solar astronomers, but not

40:42.411 --> 40:44.474
planetary science. So there's almost a complete 
segregation now. Well, it's too late to ask the

40:45.415 --> 40:52.686
participants, so I've been asking planetary 
scientists who are around today. Somewhere

40:53.787 --> 40:59.455
between 1900 and World War I, planetary astronomy 
died loudly. Who or what killed it? The

41:03.022 --> 41:27.285
new astronomy

41:03.022 --> 41:27.285
killed it. The spectroscopes came online, and the 
search for the big question, how big was the

41:27.305 --> 41:29.126
galaxy? Were there island universes apart from 
our own? What were the constituents of the stars

41:30.107 --> 41:31.168
and galaxies? What was the age of the universe? The 
big question sort of dwarfed .

41:53.024 --> 41:53.184
. .

42:00.616 --> 42:00.636
.

42:12.192 --> 42:19.122
There have been a lot of new discoveries and 
insights about the solar system in the last 25

42:12.192 --> 42:19.122
years. What do you think the most important one has 
been to

42:19.203 --> 42:37.991
the

42:19.203 --> 42:37.991
public?

42:38.011 --> 42:38.291
To the public? Well, I think the fact that we didn't 
find life on Mars is certainly important to the

42:38.311 --> 42:40.174
public. very

42:42.483 --> 43:09.655
aware of what is I

43:11.339 --> 43:35.535
saw a number of people that mentioned the 
photograph taken while we were in orbit, the

43:11.339 --> 43:35.535
photograph of the rising sun. The idea that we are 
in a very small second-rate planet going around a

43:35.555 --> 43:37.498
very small second-rate sun

43:42.592 --> 44:01.156
If

43:42.592 --> 44:01.156
we go ahead 50 years and look back, that would be the 
paradigm in which that would be identified. The

44:01.176 --> 44:02.878
homocentric view that we all have of the earth is 
pretty much all there is to it. As

44:03.331 --> 44:31.366
a

44:03.331 --> 44:31.366
planetary

44:03.331 --> 44:31.366
astronomer, what do you think, from your point of 
view, of planetary science has been the most

44:03.331 --> 44:31.366
important? Well, from my narrow perspective, I 
think Another

44:32.592 --> 44:50.984
paradigm, which recently, the last 10 years, 
concerning the low island impact, literally the

44:32.592 --> 44:50.984
impact of one body upon another. When I first 
started out in the field, There

44:52.555 --> 45:15.318
was

44:52.555 --> 45:15.318
a feeling that everything

44:52.555 --> 45:15.318
evolved very slowly. There were tremendously 
long time scales. In biology, things evolved

45:16.178 --> 45:18.340
according to the Darwinian theories. Very slight 
changes were retained if they were helpful. And

45:19.482 --> 45:20.763
likewise in the solar system, things evolved ever 
so slowly. But I think we're getting an increasing

45:20.783 --> 45:21.904
realization that uh...

45:55.094 --> 45:56.650
major results will be coming out.
