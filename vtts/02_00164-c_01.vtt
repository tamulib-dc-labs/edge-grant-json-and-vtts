WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:12.251
things special for the recognition and I suppose I 
was told that because I supported them and so forth

00:01.938 --> 00:12.251
and believed in them, which I did. Now, they always 
at home football games, where else did they

00:13.132 --> 00:18.478
normally appear? The Fat Stock Show in Houston and 
they'd go to the Battle of the Flowers in San

00:19.640 --> 00:30.713
Antonio and several times to the Stock Show in 
Houston, I mean in Fort Worth. And of course the

00:38.587 --> 00:40.769
Corps trips. Did they go to all Corps trips? Yes. 
And they, now they were not always allowed in to,

00:45.235 --> 00:52.363
you know, we had trouble even getting them in the 
stadium down here because they were tearing up the

00:52.968 --> 00:56.533
track, and we had to put them in booties. And that 
was a hassle, and we did it, and they did it. But they

01:01.080 --> 01:05.446
just go all over the place. I know one year, one of my 
captains, Captain Jim Holland, and his wife were

01:05.466 --> 01:14.560
the Army people that worked with him a lot. His wife 
was an equestrian. Still is. My other divorce now

01:17.667 --> 01:19.349
with Jim. Jim and his wife did a lot for him. And Jim 
came to me one time and said, a lot of them want to

01:24.055 --> 01:28.040
take a trail ride this summer. And so about 15 of 
them rode down into, almost down into Brownfield.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.154
A 15-day trip. And of course, I let him go. That's a 
duty trip for him. And they had a good time on that

01:43.036 --> 01:45.961
one. They had Aggies all along the way that fed them 
and put them up and took care of the horses. They

01:50.948 --> 01:52.250
engineered that thing. What

01:52.911 --> 02:01.725
were the requirements, as far as you were aware, 
for a student to be in the Mounted Cavalry? Well,

02:02.466 --> 02:05.671
first of all, when I was there, it was the first two 
things. You could not be a commander or an RV. Not

02:11.993 --> 02:13.334
that I had anything against them. It was just that I 
thought they thought. Could you be a fish? Could a

02:15.837 --> 02:16.317
freshman? Oh, we are sophomores. Sophomores. And 
the sophomores could not then and don't now ride. I

02:23.144 --> 02:27.768
mean, I'm sure they ride around out there, but 
they're not in the parade or anything like that.

02:27.788 --> 02:32.513
And only seniors in the formal appearance of the 
cow. I don't think that changed yet. I think it's

02:34.815 --> 02:36.396
still that way. The juniors are, you know, 
training for it, but they don't get Could they be in

02:40.748 --> 02:43.592
any branch? Oh, yes. Any or none. Just want to be in 
and they don't screen them or anything like that.

02:53.183 --> 02:56.107
If you want to be in the cow, you can be in the cow. You 
just have to live up to these rules and they spent a

02:56.127 --> 02:58.991
lot of time at it. How did they come up with the 
official I've often wondered, why is it called

03:04.947 --> 03:07.911
Mounted Cavalry? There's no other cavalry except 
Mounted, is there? Well, I don't know. Well, I

03:12.858 --> 03:17.884
don't know of any, but I guess that's just a... But 
isn't that the official name? Yeah. Parsons

03:20.107 --> 03:21.569
Mounted Cavalry? Back then, the cavalry was in 
tanks and so forth. Of course, when they were here,

03:26.836 --> 03:29.800
they were mounted back in the old days. But... And 
we still are, as far as I know. We're the only

03:34.146 --> 03:40.233
mounted unit in the United States, other than Fort 
Hood. We're on Fort Riley now and a few other

03:40.473 --> 03:43.757
military things. But I know Buck Henderson and I 
and my wife, we used to go out with them and cut hay in

03:44.478 --> 03:53.208
the summer and that sort of stuff. And my wife would 
drive the tractor, and Buck and I would throw bales

03:54.410 --> 03:58.735
up there. We spent a lot of time with them. We 
enjoyed it. And one other thing or two I was

04:01.934 --> 04:16.893
thinking about, we used to have cadets over the 
house once in a while, as many as we could, but one

04:01.934 --> 04:16.893
time we had a few of them out there, and just no 
special ones, just some of the kids. Anyways, when

04:16.993 --> 04:28.308
I was there, I made the comment, I was just talking 
about my backyard, and I said, God, I wish I had one

04:16.993 --> 04:28.308
of those benches like they have at the Grove. And I 
should have never said that, because the next

04:29.329 --> 04:31.772
morning, When we got up, there was a bench sitting 
out in my backyard from the grove, and it had BQ 68 on

04:32.140 --> 04:42.083
it, carved in there. I don't know if that was a fresh 
carving or not, and I never asked, but I still got

04:42.620 --> 04:50.492
that bench, and I never returned it. So I guess I 
stole a bench from the university, but that taught

04:51.333 --> 05:05.274
me then, don't ever say I wish around those guys, 
because if they like you, you'll get it. Were there

05:06.015 --> 05:09.420
any goofy things that ever happened to the 
cavalry? Oh, I don't know of any. No jokes, no

05:13.397 --> 05:15.800
pranks, no mistakes? Oh, well, yeah, I'm sure they 
made lots of those. What about cleaning up behind?

05:22.490 --> 05:25.815
Oh, well, that's a story. You know, they always, 
whenever the scooper, now that wheelbarrow with

05:26.176 --> 05:36.711
two U's on it is a brainchild of Buck Henderson and 
Tom Parsons. We're the ones that said, hey, let's

05:37.232 --> 05:40.116
get them to paint that thing and following the 
horse and put the TU in there, and that's kind of an

05:40.467 --> 05:44.732
insult to TU. So I guess I'm responsible for that, 
and Burke Henderson and I. Yeah, the cleanup crew

05:45.473 --> 05:51.540
are those freshmen? Those are sophomores. 
Sophomores. Right. Freshmen, there are no

05:54.224 --> 05:58.128
freshmen out there. And they have a, still have a 
pretty, it's a pretty big, I think it was about $150

05:58.148 --> 06:05.678
semester membership fee. I mean, you know, it's 
pretty, it takes a lot of money to go to university

06:10.488 --> 06:12.310
Picks up a good deal of it now. But the biggest 
improvement there was when that little shed was

06:13.231 --> 06:25.543
put out there with latrine facilities because it 
was monstrous out there before. And also the

06:26.684 --> 06:36.013
cavalry was the first unit or activity of the A&M to 
allow a woman in it. They had a female rider before

06:36.033 --> 06:39.516
the RVs or anybody else. And she was a good rider. 
And I can't remember her name right now, but

06:42.457 --> 06:46.864
anyway, she was the first. Were there any problems 
with that as far as you know? Well, some of the guys

06:49.488 --> 06:57.920
didn't like it too much, but they were accepted, 
and she rode better than they did, according to

06:49.488 --> 06:57.920
doing fritz and everything. Basically, the 
members, as far as you recall, were these farm boys

06:57.940 --> 07:04.930
or were they city? I would say more of them from the 
city had never seen a horse in a ranch, although

07:05.230 --> 07:14.499
there were a lot of them, both of them. But they did, 
one year they wanted me to troop the land at the

07:14.519 --> 07:23.428
parents' day parade and mounted. And I said, I'm 
not a horseman, I'm really not. I'm kind of a little

07:25.991 --> 07:28.313
scared of them. And they said, well, we'll put you 
on one that you don't have to worry about. And I

07:32.858 --> 07:35.220
said, OK, but I'll do it. I said, I'm uneasy on him, 
and just keep that in mind. So anyway, I went out

07:39.574 --> 07:47.687
there one day before the parade, the practice, and 
they pulled up some steps over there for me. I said,

07:47.787 --> 07:49.049
I ain't that old. If I can't get on him, I'm not going 
to get on him. So I got on him, and I said, now what's

07:52.053 --> 07:54.617
his name? He said, Dynamite. Dynamite? You put me 
on dynamite? Well, it wasn't dynamite. They were

08:00.024 --> 08:00.985
hassling me. But anyway, I did that the next day, 
and it went off all right. And dynamite almost went

08:05.830 --> 08:09.853
to sleep on me while I was going around. But never 
again did they ask me to ride. And I wasn't

08:14.017 --> 08:15.778
comfortable with it. But they still, my wife and I, 
we go there. We've only missed a couple of times

08:23.445 --> 08:25.947
going out there. And we have the honor of 
presenting our saber. We buy sabers for the new

08:29.908 --> 08:31.670
commander. And we've been doing that for about 25 
years. And they're

08:35.193 --> 08:42.862
real appreciative of some of them more than 
others. But there was one other story. We were out

08:46.125 --> 08:49.629
there shortly after Grace and I were married. And 
she didn't know anything about it. Never been to

08:52.131 --> 08:52.812
any. Didn't even know what it stood for. Anyway, I 
was showing around out to Green, and one of the kids

08:56.065 --> 09:03.978
was out there, and I introduced myself as Colonel 
Parsons. I went, oh, are you related to the Colonel

09:04.059 --> 09:08.727
Parsons that Sal named after him? I said, yeah, 
that's me. He said, oh, I thought he was dead. So

09:11.071 --> 09:15.458
anyway, they know me better than that now. 
Describe what the band was in terms of the

09:16.568 --> 09:23.816
commandant's concerns. Well, the band, first of 
all, I didn't have much influence on the band other

09:24.256 --> 09:38.571
than I'm responsible for them being a battery and 
artillery and infantry band. That's what it used

09:39.972 --> 09:43.276
to be, and I got them to rename it. I had no problem 
with anybody except one that was coming out of He

09:46.758 --> 09:48.902
didn't like the idea of changing it. It was a room 
band and a white band then. I just thought it more

09:52.628 --> 09:57.016
core to go back to what it used to be. And the band has 
always been rambunctious. And my senior year, My

10:06.670 --> 10:09.394
unit was, I was an A-batter. We were on the bottom 
stoop. I might have told you that yesterday. There

10:14.582 --> 10:15.523
was a band on. The band had the top three, and that 
was pretty high. They were just living. But I think

10:19.829 --> 10:21.852
they were pretty much like they were then. And I see 
in your days, it's coming up, all of the band was

10:23.715 --> 10:29.463
Army? No. Oh, they were? Whoever. Oh, okay. Okay. 
And compared to the rest of the Corps, how did the

10:34.413 --> 10:45.531
band measure, compare in terms of their grades and 
their military qualities and so forth? I don't

10:45.551 --> 10:48.215
know much of a distinction. Some of the 
top-ranking guys that I knew were in the band, and

10:48.295 --> 11:02.057
of course they worked pretty hard, but in the 
rollers industry, like the fish drill team, my

10:48.295 --> 11:02.057
goodness, the things that happened to them and I'm 
glad that that's controlled now. But cadets time

11:08.577 --> 11:19.557
is really pretty busy and they all seem to adapt to 
it. The band, the rest of the Corps, seemed to be an

11:19.537 --> 11:29.606
anti-band most of the time, when they see that band 
out there on that field.

11:29.826 --> 11:36.392
Is part of that maybe envy, respect, admiration? 
Well, I think, look at our Aggie band out there. I

11:42.237 --> 11:48.582
think they get along well, but of course that band 
drill field was not sacred ground I didn't even

11:48.916 --> 11:52.180
know that after I left here. I was getting ready to 
walk across it, and one day when Grace's son, you

11:52.220 --> 12:01.451
know, we brought him to A&M, and he'd never been to 
college. He was in the Navy, and we talked him into

12:01.511 --> 12:04.214
coming in. He was a B-1 commander, and he said, oh, 
don't step out there. And I said, why not? And they

12:08.239 --> 12:10.842
were in that little hut there near there. He said, 
man, I'll form you. Anyway, I don't go in the band

12:14.166 --> 12:16.489
field anymore. We used to have, you know, played 
football and all kinds of stuff out there. Now,

12:21.262 --> 12:24.929
Colonel Adams was band director when you got here. 
Right. And did he go all through your years? No, Joe

12:29.918 --> 12:31.301
Haney. Joe Haney? He came in before I got to Adams 
for time. All right, and describe working with Joe

12:35.649 --> 12:38.655
Haney. Oh, he was very cooperative. Colonel 
Adams, I didn't have a fight. He'd just been there

12:42.001 --> 12:44.144
longer than Ripley. And he was, you know, he didn't 
mess with his band. And I didn't. He didn't argue a

12:51.553 --> 12:53.415
whole lot about it. He just wanted to know why did I 
want to change it from green to white. And I still

12:56.960 --> 13:01.886
think it was a good move of him, but there was no big 
problem. Fish drill team. It was here when you got

13:05.250 --> 13:06.932
here. Had there been a fish drill team when you were 
a cadet? No. I don't know when it came about. It

13:16.205 --> 13:19.711
started when they were out at Bryanfield. 
Bryanfield, that's right, as a matter of fact.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.380
Bryanfield, of course, happened during my time. 
But I never thought much about the fish drill team

13:25.603 --> 13:30.051
when I came back. And I was pretty impressed with 
the way they operated and the national champions

13:30.723 --> 13:36.811
and this, that, and the other. And Maitland was 
doing a good job with them. And I don't hold the

13:39.734 --> 13:53.912
statement I'm going to make as maybe not the truth 
or whatever, but I made a mistake turning over to

13:39.734 --> 13:53.912
the Navy Marine program because Marines have a 
different outlook on discipline, and I think

13:54.314 --> 14:00.624
that's what happened. And the Army, when we were 
running the drill team as far as supervision, I'm

14:01.686 --> 14:13.164
sure a lot of that stuff still went on, but not near 
as severely as it was. And I think that, like I said,

14:14.105 --> 14:19.714
I have nothing but admiration for Marines having 
gone into Incheon on the third wave behind the

14:20.183 --> 14:23.086
Marines. I was very happy for the Marines, but I'm 
afraid that's probably what happened to them. But

14:30.052 --> 14:35.897
while you were commandant, were there some hazing 
problems in the fish drill team? Well, I knew that

14:36.657 --> 14:46.846
they were they were hassling the heck out of them up 
during their drill period, but I don't know what

14:36.657 --> 14:46.846
went on in the military area. There was probably 
nothing there because they were scattered

14:49.259 --> 14:51.541
throughout the court. But I know their training 
was very disciplined. What were some, as far as you

14:55.205 --> 15:07.919
were aware, while you were commandant, what were 
some of the examples of the dormitory hazing and

14:55.205 --> 15:07.919
pranks and jokes and all that? What were they 
doing? Well, I'm pretty sure that there were

15:09.721 --> 15:17.069
occasions when the board was used. I don't think it 
was too often. I do know of one occasion when they

15:19.995 --> 15:31.782
turned some chickens loose in a room over a spring 
break and turned the heat up. I'd never heard of

15:32.824 --> 15:37.896
that one before, but that was a disaster.

15:38.382 --> 15:48.035
I know one morning,

15:38.382 --> 15:48.035
Buck Henderson, who was on my staff then, had been 
over in the core area and offered me a call. It was

15:48.055 --> 15:51.025
before everybody was there. I don't know, 7 
o'clock in the morning, something like that, and

15:51.359 --> 15:56.852
said, Conner, get over to the dorm and live in right 
now. Somebody just put saccharine in the commodes

15:57.233 --> 16:01.864
in the dorm on the first stoop. And, of course, we 
called maintenance people. By the time I got over

16:05.111 --> 16:08.760
there, Buck and I cleaned that concrete out of them 
toilets. before it set. I mean, we were digging in,

16:10.255 --> 16:20.045
and that wasn't one of the, I don't guess you 
normally do that, but we didn't want that stuff to

16:10.255 --> 16:20.045
sit in there. We had a heck of a mess. Don't know who 
did it to this date, but we got it out before it set

16:22.247 --> 16:27.413
because of the still water. Drownouts? I'm sorry? 
Were there drownouts? I just don't know why or who

16:32.378 --> 16:35.421
did it or anything. No, no, no, but were there 
drownouts going on Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes. I don't, I

16:43.173 --> 16:51.343
never heard of them having those sticks that were 
used to barricade, you know the name for them.

16:51.363 --> 16:51.624
Yeah. Were the, were those not being used, or they 
were? They were when I was a student, but not later

16:54.487 --> 16:58.152
because they could lock their doors. Ah. We were 
not allowed to lock doors. That's right, that's

17:00.234 --> 17:02.457
right. And during your days as Commandant, were 
they going down in the steam tunnels? Not to my

17:09.278 --> 17:10.400
knowledge. That had been closed off? I never heard 
of it. I never mentioned the tunnels either. Were

17:17.248 --> 17:22.073
there ever any incidents in the dining hall that 
you had to deal with? No, not really other than the

17:23.415 --> 17:29.862
food throwing, but it wasn't near what it was. air 
raids back as what they used to have in my day, and

17:30.247 --> 17:36.834
they were pretty bad then. What about drinking in 
the dorms? I'm sure it was there, but it wasn't

17:39.997 --> 17:43.721
open. The problem was beer busts off campus 
primarily. Where did they go for those? I guess

17:52.150 --> 17:59.157
they went out to the old, on the other side of the 
issue, where those to Quonset Huts where, that's

17:59.727 --> 18:05.114
where we found the cannons. And I think I went out 
there some, and I don't know whether they ever did

18:06.255 --> 18:12.823
that with the cow there or not. I've never heard of 
it going on out there, but I don't know. I just don't

18:18.850 --> 18:20.753
know where they're hanging it from. And y'all 
didn't have to worry about drugs, did you? No. I

18:25.378 --> 18:28.502
don't even know if we had any or not. I don't think 
there was. I just wasn't very sophisticated on

18:29.867 --> 18:34.492
that until I got to Fort Carson. Were there girls 
with, were there guys that brought girls into

18:35.113 --> 18:40.218
their rooms? Was that a problem in the Corps then? 
While you were commandant? It was not, it was

18:45.083 --> 18:48.106
pretty rare. It did happen. I remember one 
occasion that I was wandering through the

18:50.589 --> 18:57.156
corridor in the morning four or five o'clock, 
something like that, and there was a kid tied to a

18:58.267 --> 19:08.521
flagpole, you know, in underwear and a mattress 
cover and chained to it with a handcuff, asking

18:58.267 --> 19:08.521
what outfit, and he told me. I said, I'll get you 
loose. And so I went through this outfit and banged

19:10.864 --> 19:24.662
on the door, and I'm in the uniform, and the door 
pulls open, and this guy says, what the F do you

19:10.864 --> 19:24.662
want? lights on and here's a full colonel standing 
up here and there's a guy on his bed over there. So I

19:31.840 --> 19:51.662
wanted that guy cut loose down there in two minutes 
and I wanted to see him in my office at 7 a.m. in his

19:31.840 --> 19:51.662
dress uniform and anyway he showed up and figured 
he'd pack his bags and whatever and I just had a

19:31.840 --> 19:51.662
follow son chat with him and told him They were 
stupid and he was taking a chance for his whole life

19:52.182 --> 20:00.854
and I'm not against what they were doing or 
whatever, but that's not the time and the place.

20:00.954 --> 20:04.238
And he's my friend to this day. Oh good. And I've 
never mentioned his name and never will.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.469
RVs. What role do the Ross Volunteers play? Well, 
you know, they were disbanded during the war. And

20:19.355 --> 20:27.628
they started them back, I believe, you probably 
know this better than me, I think it was 47. And they

20:27.648 --> 20:30.593
used to drill out there on the band drill field. And 
I used to look out my dorm room window and say, look

20:31.074 --> 20:34.539
at those idiots out there. I wasn't in an RV. And I 
don't, you know, didn't really want to be one. for a

20:41.002 --> 20:42.344
couple of reasons. One is I did have that job, and 
secondly, I couldn't do much sense of going around

20:42.364 --> 20:49.854
out there, and I couldn't afford a uniform. But I 
did find out I'd been blackballed. And

20:53.159 --> 21:05.256
later found out the reason is, and I don't 
understand to this day why this guy objected, but I

20:53.159 --> 21:05.256
was late dating my roommate's date.

21:08.861 --> 21:10.924
So I imagine that had something to do with it. But 
during your days as commandant, the RVs... I was

21:16.608 --> 21:19.090
very impressed with them. They were quality 
people. I never heard of any of them getting in real

21:22.494 --> 21:26.097
serious trouble. And how does somebody become a 
member of the Ross Volunteers? Well, of course,

21:30.622 --> 21:38.970
they got to have good grades and what translates to 
about a B average there was. You know, and the clean

21:39.406 --> 21:42.849
record in the corral. But they have to be voted into 
it, sort of like a lodge. And about how many members

21:49.036 --> 21:51.378
are there? Goodness, I don't know, a hundred and 
some odd. I don't know for sure. Juniors and

21:53.801 --> 21:54.982
seniors? Juniors and seniors. I just don't know. 
As far as you're aware, does it matter whether

21:57.404 --> 22:02.349
they're Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine? No 
difference. And they select their own commander.

22:07.182 --> 22:16.335
And any junior or senior in the Corps is eligible, 
including the Corps commander, and all of them can

22:07.182 --> 22:16.335
be RVs. Right, if they meet the minimum grade 
requirements. So the RVs would claim to be the

22:20.922 --> 22:25.468
cream of the crop? They claim that, yeah. And they 
probably are. I certainly know the ones I know that

22:30.656 --> 22:34.401
were RVs and so forth. Those are more of them. 
acquainted with the Corps of Staff, and they were

22:36.308 --> 22:40.774
good kids. Did you ever have any problems with an RV 
activity? No. During your years as Commandant,

22:46.561 --> 22:50.686
who were the key people on your office staff? Well, 
you know, I mentioned Don Johnson, and

22:51.808 --> 23:00.419
were there some John Adams? Were there some 
secretaries? Well, John Adams later stole my

23:03.005 --> 23:11.216
secretary away from me and married her. Oh. So, you 
know, he had been married previously and they were

23:13.139 --> 23:18.086
divorced. And Sherry, who is his wife now, I don't 
know if you know her or not, she's a lovely gal.

23:24.655 --> 23:28.320
She's a senior secretary out at the vet college. 
But he stole her away from the commandant. But we

23:32.509 --> 23:45.841
had one lady there who answered the phone at the 
receptionist, and she was there when I was a

23:32.509 --> 23:45.841
student, so she was kind of hard to get along with. 
But the cadets sometimes wanted to see me, and I

23:45.941 --> 23:56.010
always told them, unless I got my door closed, you 
know, you can call me, but that's what I'm here for,

23:45.941 --> 23:56.010
you know. They didn't see me open the door any time. 
But what was a, during the normal week, describe a

23:59.063 --> 24:07.872
typical day for the commandant. What time did you 
get up? What time did you get to the office? What did

24:10.214 --> 24:10.895
you do? Well, again, I'm probably not your typical 
person. I usually got to the office by 6 in the

24:15.700 --> 24:23.848
morning because I'm an early riser and that's just 
my habit from the military. And I'd sit around

24:24.469 --> 24:27.332
there and go over the, whatever paperwork I had to 
do and all that kind of stuff. And then people

24:30.483 --> 24:37.311
started coming in 7.30, 8 o'clock, like that, and 
started doing business. And usually some parents

24:37.412 --> 24:47.585
would come in during the day wanting to talk about 
the Corps and print on the schedule and spend a good

24:37.412 --> 24:47.585
bit of time with them and walk around with them. And 
I met with the Corps commander almost on a daily

24:48.606 --> 24:54.113
basis. If he weren't there, the deputy would come 
in and we'd talk about, you know, what's going on in

24:54.751 --> 25:05.566
the Corps and any problems or something like that. 
Usually, most of the time I'd stay for the evening

25:05.586 --> 25:13.116
and pass by and wouldn't eat with him. I'd go home 
about six o'clock. Where did you eat lunch

25:15.779 --> 25:17.782
normally? I never ate lunch. Oh, you didn't? No. 
Right. And so pass by, then would you go home? Go

25:22.909 --> 25:23.610
home, yeah. How many, during a normal week, how 
many nights were busy with campus business? Not

25:30.435 --> 25:34.939
with the Corps, usually the nights, the nights 
were busy with all these things that you got to show

25:30.435 --> 25:34.939
up at, you know. It seemed like every night you had 
to do something, and it really got to be a hassle.

25:39.763 --> 25:41.044
And almost every weekend. Oh yeah, and it's never, 
never any home time, and it's very bad for a family

25:41.284 --> 25:49.151
with children. Not with even the wife, the wife 
loved it. What were, what were you able to do to

25:51.573 --> 25:54.255
relax? Well. Hobbies, fun? Of course, it's kind of 
hard to say. I'd like to go to the football games and

26:05.429 --> 26:17.708
such as that, but I'm still in a sense somewhat 
duty, but I don't remember a whole lot of free time.

26:17.949 --> 26:21.154
We used to go out to the country western place But 
again, the kids were out there too. I used to like to

26:24.170 --> 26:25.612
do that stuff. And

26:27.074 --> 26:34.125
I don't remember any special activities we were 
in. It seemed like everything was around the

26:34.145 --> 26:37.210
university. Right. You served as Commandant from 
71 to? 77. Seven. Six years. And that six years was

26:44.321 --> 26:48.087
because it was time for you to retire officially? 
Well, I was, I had another year I could have stayed

26:48.387 --> 26:53.392
on active duty, but there was no way I could stay. 
You know, normal tour is three years, extended to

26:53.412 --> 26:57.816
four. And, you know, unknown to me, and I brought 
the corps responsible for me staying. I don't know

27:05.523 --> 27:09.386
if you know about the petition or not. The what? The 
petition. No. This is a, and I didn't know this was

27:12.329 --> 27:16.453
going on, believe me. But they didn't want me to 
leave, and they found this thing here and gave it to

27:17.682 --> 27:25.232
Dr. Williams.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.364
These are all members of the Corps. Yes, that's the 
only one. How marvelous. And this is dated 1970.

27:45.003 --> 27:45.524
570. 75 and 76. The 100th anniversary. Therefore, 
we, the undersigned members of sophomore and

27:51.011 --> 28:07.872
junior classes, respectfully request you as our 
president take steps to renew Colonel Parsons'

27:51.011 --> 28:07.872
tour of duty to A&M for another year in order that he 
might help us have a noteworthy centennial

27:51.011 --> 28:07.872
observance of our school. How did you learn about 
that? Dr. Williams called me to his office and laid

28:11.476 --> 28:20.070
that on me and says,

28:11.476 --> 28:20.070
what do you feel about this? And I said, well, Dr. 
Williams, the Army is not going to let me stay. And

28:24.457 --> 28:28.023
he says, how bad do you want it? I said, I'd love to. 
He says, you understand you'll never be a general

28:29.545 --> 28:32.650
if you stay. And I said, I'm probably not going to be 
a general anyway. And I said, I've had the time of my

28:36.286 --> 28:38.749
life. And I said, I'm willing to do it if it'll work. 
And he said, I think we can work it out. Well,

28:45.918 --> 28:53.407
General Otter, who was my army boss, came down 
here, and we had a meeting in the president's

28:45.918 --> 28:53.407
office. And General Ludeke also was there. And he 
says, Parsons can't stay. We've got the guy picked

29:01.677 --> 29:04.420
out that's going to be this guy. Dr. Williams said, 
don't waste my time. Parsons is going to study, and

29:07.398 --> 29:10.522
he's going to be the commandant. And General Honor 
said, Marshall, we just can't do it then. I mean, we

29:16.329 --> 29:17.010
won't allow it. And then Dr. Williams says, do you 
know who Tiger Teague is? And anyway, he allowed

29:22.356 --> 29:25.440
us. He'd heard of him. And Dr. Williams said, I'll 
be in touch with Tiger Teague. Well, shortly

29:29.865 --> 29:33.630
thereafter, I got a call that I was extended I was 
not truly loved by my general. So that's how it

29:38.830 --> 29:45.640
happened, and of course it went into two years, and 
it was time for me to move on now. What do you

29:46.401 --> 29:48.864
remember about that centennial year? Well, it was 
damn busy going to things. I don't remember too

29:52.870 --> 30:01.322
much, but just a lot of activities.

30:01.927 --> 30:05.410
Corps was deeply involved in it, of course. And 
during that year, Dr. Williams had his heart

30:05.431 --> 30:08.393
attacks. Yes. Do you remember hearing about any 
news about that? Well, of course, everybody was

30:13.899 --> 30:20.646
concerned about it, but not much news.

30:24.209 --> 30:29.875
I was primarily involved in it, and General 
Simpson was running things and so on, but he was the

30:30.108 --> 30:34.194
pipeline. I didn't, I used to see Dr. Williams 
almost daily, but not during the Act of Assumption

30:34.294 --> 30:40.863
game. And how did you feel when Dr. Williams is no 
longer physically able to be the president? Well,

30:49.354 --> 30:55.643
you know,

30:49.354 --> 30:55.643
he was the president during my period, period. I 
wouldn't under any others. Dr. Miller would not

30:58.925 --> 31:01.048
come on the same. So I can't compare him to any 
others. He was just, he was really logical and he

31:05.596 --> 31:20.601
was very military oriented and student oriented 
and I just, I just think he was a wonderful person.
