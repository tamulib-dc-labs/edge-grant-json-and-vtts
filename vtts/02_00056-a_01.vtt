00:26.288 --> 00:28.510
This is Monday, June 28th. What's

00:28.970 --> 00:33.034
the name of this building? We were in the Central 
Square building. Central Square building on

00:38.079 --> 00:45.966
North Central Expressway in Dallas, and I have the 
honor and pleasure of chatting with John

00:38.079 --> 00:45.966
Creighton. That's C-R-I-C-H-T-O-N.

00:46.247 --> 00:52.272
And known to my friends as Jack. As Jack, but 
pronounced Creighton. Right. To introduce

00:55.955 --> 01:11.443
yourself, sir, to anyone who might hear this tape 
or read the transcription, give us a brief

00:55.955 --> 01:11.443
biographical summary of your experience in life 
from growing up, mom and dad, before you got to A&M.

01:13.127 --> 01:18.857
I was born in a little town in Louisiana named after 
my grandfather of Creighton, Louisiana. My

01:19.377 --> 01:23.601
grandfather owned a cotton plantation and a 
steamboat landing. And in 1916,

01:24.502 --> 01:41.198
he sold this plantation to the Palmer Brothers in 
Chicago, who owned the Palmer House, among other

01:24.502 --> 01:41.198
things. And after he sold this plantation, they 
struck oil on it. And over a number of years, I took

01:48.807 --> 01:54.865
out several million barrels of oil. And I've been 
trying to get even with the oil business ever since

01:54.905 --> 02:02.547
then, because my grandfather didn't retain any 
interest in this. My father was a graduate of LSU.

02:05.719 --> 02:11.686
My mother was a schoolteacher that went to 
Louisiana Normal in Natchitoches, Louisiana.

02:12.487 --> 02:18.154
And my father ran the plantation for the Palmer 
brothers for a number of years. And then he and an

02:18.854 --> 02:26.323
associate bought out the Palmer brothers' 
interest, and he continued to run the plantation.

02:26.489 --> 02:29.593
raising cotton and cattle, mostly. And my father 
died when I was 12 years old. I attended

02:34.899 --> 02:51.400
grade school in a... Creighton did not have school 
facilities when I grew up, and I attended a school

02:34.899 --> 02:51.400
in East Point, Louisiana, three miles away. And it 
was a very good academic school. Also, I played on

02:59.931 --> 03:07.241
the basketball team at East Point. And then my 
senior year, I stayed with my aunt in Shreveport,

03:08.102 --> 03:17.455
Louisiana, and went to school at Byrd High School. 
where I played basketball on the Byrd High team and

03:17.435 --> 03:34.650
was the leading scorer at Byrd and held a school 
scoring record for several years.

03:34.630 --> 03:47.063
Then I decided I wanted to take petroleum 
engineering as a means of getting even with the oil

03:34.630 --> 03:47.063
business because my grandfather sold out without 
retaining any of it. And I went to see Mr. McGowan,

03:48.124 --> 03:53.409
who was the president of the United Gas Company. 
Mr. McGowan had been the auditor, had been the

03:53.990 --> 04:00.857
accountant for the Palmer Brothers. He and my 
father had gotten to be very good friends. So as I

04:04.424 --> 04:07.989
say, my father died when I was 12. And so I went up to 
see Mr. McGowan. I said, I want to take petroleum

04:11.053 --> 04:13.916
engineering. Where should I go to school? He said, 
well, our experience has been that graduates of

04:16.119 --> 04:30.017
University of Oklahoma and Texas A&M have been the 
best that we've hired. And he said, if you're

04:30.402 --> 04:36.230
interested in the military, Texas A&M is the place 
to go. He said, we have a plane. And mind you, this is

04:38.573 --> 04:39.794
1933. He said, we have a plane going down to Houston 
taking Mr. Hargrove, the vice president, for a

04:39.894 --> 04:47.865
meeting. And en route to Houston, we'll drop you 
off at College Station. And of course, there was no

04:53.892 --> 04:57.275
airfield at College Station at that time. So sure 
enough, we took off. It was a twin-engine beach. I

05:04.002 --> 05:06.024
remember the pilot's name was Eddie Heffley. And 
when we got over College Station, we circled

05:06.665 --> 05:15.293
around and Eddie looked for a place to land and 
finally found an alfalfa field that looked

05:06.665 --> 05:15.293
suitable. So we landed in this alfalfa field. 
Farmers came from everywhere to see this plain

05:19.762 --> 05:23.050
land. And so I got off the plane and looked like I was 
received as somebody who just got down from Mars.

05:32.652 --> 05:35.037
And I caught a ride. hitchhiked into town, into 
College Station, and the petroleum engineering

05:35.422 --> 05:42.835
building had just been built. I talked to some 
people there. I went around the campus, talked to

05:44.658 --> 05:54.274
various people, and liked the military, and the 
people were so friendly. and everybody howdy and

05:54.254 --> 06:01.255
answered any question I wanted to ask. So I 
highwayed back to the alfalfa field. And sure

06:07.130 --> 06:12.782
enough, at 3.30, the plane returned from Houston, 
circled around again. Farmers came from miles to

06:12.862 --> 06:26.050
see the plane land, and landed, picked me up, went 
back to Shreveport, and I reported back to Mr.

06:12.862 --> 06:26.050
McGowan that I decided to go to A&M. That was how I 
first got interested in A&M, and that's how I ended

06:26.030 --> 06:34.622
up at A&M. And that visit was about what time of the 
year? That visit must have been in around May or

06:38.167 --> 06:44.817
June of that year. Then your goal was to be a 
petroleum engineer, and what did you think you

06:45.658 --> 06:53.910
were going to do with that degree? Well, what I 
thought I was going to do was make some money out of

06:54.869 --> 06:57.652
it. So anyway, I entered Texas A&M not knowing the 
traditions they had there, only that I had also

07:00.516 --> 07:21.501
checked with other people and found out A&M had a 
very good academic reputation. and also that it

07:21.481 --> 07:33.620
was affordable as to the amount of money you had to 
spend, and also like the military. So I had an uncle

07:34.441 --> 07:38.427
who was a captain in the Field Artillery, regular 
Army. I visited him several times up at Fort

07:40.802 --> 07:46.452
Robinson, Nebraska. And so that was the 
horse-drawn field artillery, and I liked to ride.

07:53.224 --> 08:03.182
And so he taught me English-style riding, 
although I had known how to ride growing up on the

07:53.224 --> 08:03.182
plantation. And so I joined the field artillery, E 
Battery Field Artillery. And anyway,

08:12.203 --> 08:19.555
like I say, I was not acquainted with the 
traditions. And I remember that first, about the

08:20.296 --> 08:27.769
first three nights we were there, they had a 
meeting of all the freshmen on the YMCA steps. And

08:31.060 --> 08:36.669
they had greeted us, somebody greeted us and 
welcomed us to the college. And all at once

08:37.730 --> 08:43.059
somebody whipped out a Sam Brown belt and said, air 
out, Fish. I didn't know what was happening. until

08:45.383 --> 08:54.997
I got hit on the leg several times and I decided that 
running was the only thing to do, which I did with

08:45.383 --> 08:54.997
the rest of the fish. And I think I spent the night 
out in the woods there and came back the next day.

09:01.247 --> 09:06.074
And that was my introduction to the traditions at 
A&M. When you came to enroll in September, how did

09:06.495 --> 09:12.724
you get from Northwest Louisiana at the College 
Station. Interesting. I came by train and left

09:16.467 --> 09:20.693
from Shreveport. I forget it was quite a long train 
trip and at Hearn you had to change trains there.

09:28.304 --> 09:36.957
Hearn was quite a railroad center at that time and 
so had about a two or three hour layover in Hearn

09:28.304 --> 09:36.957
until we got on the train going to College Station. 
And I had a, I think I had a steamer truck, which I had

09:41.083 --> 09:53.207
a heck of a time getting from the station to the, 
from the station to College Station. to the room

09:53.187 --> 09:56.695
I'd been assigned to. What did you bring with you as 
a freshman? What was in that truck? I knew you had

10:01.886 --> 10:09.964
military uniforms, but I had athletic equipment. 
and, of course, some business-type clothes and

10:09.944 --> 10:26.161
some social-type clothes, a lot of shoes, and I was 
pretty well outfitted. And then, of course, I got

10:26.761 --> 10:31.266
the uniforms when I got to College Station. And I 
remember we were assigned to Hart Hall. It was a new

10:38.497 --> 10:40.321
building at that time. And I roomed with a fellow 
named Phelps Lommadew, who was from Port Arthur.

10:50.660 --> 11:00.319
And he, his

10:50.660 --> 11:00.319
last name translated, I think, is Man of God. 
L-A-M-B-A-R. Phelps was his first name.

11:05.422 --> 11:06.483
L-Lamadu. H-O-M-M-E-D-I-E-U. Oh. Phelps 
Lamadu. And he had been a star quarterback on the

11:13.516 --> 11:18.004
Fort Arthur football team. And there was a great 
rivalry between Port Arthur and Beaumont at that

11:18.727 --> 11:23.475
time. I guess there always has been. And we had two 
guys from, played on the football team at

11:24.897 --> 11:38.579
Beaumont, two in Port Arthur, and they had a great 
rivalry. Describe your freshman room. What did

11:42.265 --> 11:45.190
you and Phelps have in that room? In that room, we 
had two desks. I had a radio and a double bunk bed,

11:48.160 --> 12:00.659
and you flipped to see who had the top bunk and who 
had the bottom bunk. And it was a nice room, and I

12:01.881 --> 12:09.372
forget whether we had a washbowl in it. I'm sure the 
John was a community John. And what we roomed,

12:22.295 --> 12:40.438
oddly enough, we roomed between two seniors' 
rooms, and this was on the second floor, and the

12:40.773 --> 12:47.601
It wasn't too long before we found out what we were 
supposed to do. The sophomores called a meeting

12:47.642 --> 13:01.118
and told us what we were required to do, and I was 
assigned to be the room orderly for one of the

12:47.642 --> 13:01.118
seniors next door. I happened to be the captain of 
the battery. Captain, his name was Charlie

13:04.162 --> 13:08.147
Swanson. I remember he roomed with a guy named Yuki 
Porter, and the,

13:08.887 --> 13:26.203
but the sophomores told us our duties and so forth, 
and then introduced us to the, to hazing, and At

13:26.588 --> 13:29.234
that time, I remember about 18 sophomores. The 
reason I remember the exact number is that each one

13:29.274 --> 13:37.632
of them got three licks at you, which adds up to 54. 
So I can divide that by three and get the number 18

13:38.473 --> 13:43.664
rather readily. What did they use for paddles? The 
paddles were sawed off and shaved off baseball

13:46.231 --> 13:57.413
bats for the most part. But they were thin. They 
were sawed off quite a bit. It was not like a whole

14:00.479 --> 14:03.345
baseball bat. It stung pretty good, but you soon 
learned that after the first several licks, why,

14:03.933 --> 14:25.897
your buttocks got sort of numb, and it

14:03.933 --> 14:25.897
didn't hurt too much. And anyway, if a sophomore 
hits you low, why, you had licks on him. So they were

14:31.135 --> 14:40.455
pretty accurate on where they hit you because if 
they hit you lower, you could say, okay, it's my

14:31.135 --> 14:40.455
turn, you know. Your outfit, what was it? E Battery 
Field Artillery. Did it have a nickname? No, I

14:47.487 --> 14:53.323
don't recall, but that battery was noted for 
winning intramurals. We were intramural

14:53.584 --> 14:57.896
champions, which was a big deal in the A&M at that 
time. And that tradition continued. As a matter of

15:01.987 --> 15:03.150
fact, when When I became captain of the battery in 
my senior year, when the freshmen checked in, we

15:03.620 --> 15:20.667
went down to the registration line and we 
recruited guys by sports. So that we ended up with

15:20.647 --> 15:31.502
some guys who weren't quite good enough, let's 
say, to make the football team or the basketball

15:20.647 --> 15:31.502
team, but were pretty good athletes. And we 
continued to win the intramural. How did the

15:34.265 --> 15:39.613
outfit introduce you and your fish buddies to A&M 
traditions? How did they explain things and tell

15:40.153 --> 15:45.000
you what you were to do and not to do? The sophomores 
took care of that. The sophomores

15:47.986 --> 15:52.895
called you together on that. And you had mentioned 
Colonel Anderson, who was a great guy. I ran

16:00.470 --> 16:07.343
cross-country under Colonel Anderson because he 
was the track coach, and then he became

16:00.470 --> 16:07.343
commandant. And Colonel Anderson was a man who 
instilled character in the guys who ran for him.

16:17.897 --> 16:29.348
And as later I recall, there was one incident where 
a guy crawled across the finish line and actually

16:17.897 --> 16:29.348
won the meet for him. But Colonel Anderson, I 
remember him for another reason. When I was

16:35.073 --> 16:36.975
captain of the battery, there was some hazing 
going on in my battery. And so he called me over and

16:41.999 --> 16:51.655
he said, Jack, I want you to get the names of those 
sophomores that did this hazing, understand

16:41.999 --> 16:51.655
there's been some hazing. He said, I want to 
inspect them. And I said, fine, come over and

16:53.377 --> 16:55.761
inspect them, Colonel. So lined up all the fish, 
and they dropped their trousers. And the man,

17:00.549 --> 17:05.697
their buttocks were just blue as a grape. And he 
said, Jack, I want you to get the names of those

17:05.812 --> 17:09.578
sophomores that did this. And I said, what are you 
going to do with them, Colonel? He said, I'm going

17:11.981 --> 17:13.043
to kick them out. And I said, well, in that case, 
Colonel, I'm sorry, I just can't do that. And he

17:17.690 --> 17:18.772
said, you're busted. Hand me over your buttons. So 
I peeled off my buttons and gave them to him. He

17:22.838 --> 17:24.901
said, you have to march in ranks. So this I did for 
the next week. And at the end of the week, Colonel

17:31.985 --> 17:37.777
Anderson called me over and he said, Jack, I've 
decided not to kick these guys out of school. I'm

17:39.521 --> 17:41.706
going to put them on the bull ring for the rest of the 
year. And I said, in that case, Colonel, I'll get

17:42.528 --> 17:44.893
you their names. So I went back to the fish and I 
said, give me the names of the sophomores that did

17:45.414 --> 17:51.968
this. and I said the colonel gives me his word he's 
not going to kick these guys out of school so anyway

17:52.353 --> 18:17.331
they turned in a list of the people and it turned out 
that these fish had turned in the names of just the

17:52.353 --> 18:17.331
sophomores they didn't like and two or three of 
them had been in Houston when this happened and so I

17:52.353 --> 18:17.331
turned the names into the colonel and he put all 
these guys on the bull ring including these guys

18:17.311 --> 18:21.377
who were innocent from Houston. But anyway, I 
think that was one of the best experiences of my

18:34.237 --> 18:48.500
being at A&M actually was the, was being, you went 
from a fish to a corporal, then a sergeant, then to

18:34.237 --> 18:48.500
an officer. And I was first sergeant in my outfit, 
and then I got to be captain. and a captain of an

18:53.913 --> 19:00.462
outfit had a lot of responsibilities and has to 
make a lot of decisions. And this was wonderful

19:00.522 --> 19:05.750
training that I wouldn't take anything for. In 
those first, how did you register for your

19:08.253 --> 19:13.721
academics that first semester? Do you remember 
how? Yeah, we went to the, I'm not exactly sure, but

19:15.175 --> 19:29.349
you had certain requirements according to what 
you had signed up for. Like I've taken petroleum

19:29.389 --> 19:40.761
engineering, and you had to take some basic 
courses, English and so forth.

19:40.741 --> 19:53.944
As a freshman year, you didn't have too many 
options, but as time went on, sophomores and

19:40.741 --> 19:53.944
juniors and seniors, you did have options. 
Describe as much as you can recall that first

19:54.325 --> 19:59.033
semester academically. What were those classes 
like for a boy from Louisiana? Well, the classes in

20:02.054 --> 20:11.147
the first year, I remember Tom Harrington taught 
chemistry. Oh, describe him as a teacher. He was a

20:12.609 --> 20:13.871
wonderful guy. But he taught chemistry, and he 
also took people on tours to Europe every year. And

20:24.487 --> 20:27.471
he was a very broad-gauge teacher. guy and was very 
stimulating to the students, I'd say. But he had

20:35.793 --> 20:42.924
large classes,

20:35.793 --> 20:42.924
but I later got to know Tom quite well. Did he have a 
nickname? Did the students give him a nickname? I

20:46.469 --> 20:47.350
don't remember. So many of them did have, but I 
don't remember Tom having any nickname. He was

20:53.158 --> 20:55.341
from up here at McKinney originally. Plano. 
Plano, right. Plano and McKinney, I knew that. But

21:00.392 --> 21:09.113
then the other classes... Well, not English. Do 
you remember a special? Oh, yes, I do know English.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.485
John Paul Abbott was the I remember really 
stimulated me as far as English was concerned. And

21:21.311 --> 21:23.814
he also was the tennis coach. And I played tennis. I 
was on the varsity in tennis and played several

21:27.999 --> 21:32.645
years. Describe him as a teacher. As a teacher, he 
was stimulating. And as a matter of fact, when I was

21:40.555 --> 21:43.358
a sophomore, They had the William Morris 
Sophomore Writing Contest. And the prize was $25,

21:49.750 --> 21:54.255
which was a lot of money at that time. And I won the 
thing. I won the William Morris, but John Paul

21:56.358 --> 22:07.952
Abbott was helpful in my, because I went to him from 
time to time and got his advice on things. And I

22:07.972 --> 22:14.880
wrote a, my paper was on Huey P. Long. which was sort 
of an interesting character that I knew a lot about

22:14.860 --> 22:20.568
from Louisiana. I knew a lot of the things that 
actually

22:20.808 --> 22:38.993
newspapers didn't, and I think that was one of the 
reasons I won it, because it was sort of a yellow

22:20.808 --> 22:38.993
journalism.

22:39.754 --> 22:43.078
But in my early days at A&M, I went out for fish 
basketball, and I made the team, and I later played

22:43.480 --> 22:53.660
varsity at A&M. Describe going out for the fish. 
What was freshman basketball like then? A whole

22:59.412 --> 23:02.097
bunch of people. A lot of people who, and the coach 
had to cut pretty good to weed the people out. Who

23:09.051 --> 23:09.752
was the coach? At that time, I think the freshman 
coach was Higginbottom, but the varsity coach was

23:10.654 --> 23:23.292
John Reed, and who is, if you have talked to anybody 
about John Reed, he's a a classic among basketball

23:23.693 --> 23:26.198
coaches. I remember he, at one time, we couldn't 
hit, people for some reason weren't hitting the

23:28.283 --> 23:40.048
basket. And so at the halftime, he brought a step 
ladder out and had everybody climb up the step

23:40.973 --> 23:50.368
ladder and dunk the ball in to show that it really 
would go through. And then another time, we had a

23:52.351 --> 23:59.542
guy on the team who was sort of a, he wasn't passing 
the ball to other guys. So at the half, Coach Reed

24:00.343 --> 24:04.129
said, He said, you know, I thought everybody knew 
everybody here. He said, Mr. Carmichael, I want

24:06.693 --> 24:10.177
you to meet Mr. Hutto. Mr. Hutto, I want you to meet 
so-and-so. And he introduced everybody. But that

24:15.825 --> 24:19.290
was his style. Describe the basketball arena 
then. Well, the basketball arena then, it would

24:22.908 --> 24:30.103
seat about 3,500 people, I guess. It's now torn 
down where it was.

24:38.450 --> 24:39.973
Everybody went to the games. I mean, it wasn't like 
now where you got this beautiful arena and only

24:39.993 --> 24:48.851
about a third of it was filled up, but everybody 
went to the games. For freshmen, who did y'all

24:49.673 --> 24:51.597
play? Well, we played We played high school teams 
and

24:55.713 --> 25:02.767
mostly high school teams. I can't remember us 
playing any college teams. Most parts of freshmen

25:07.255 --> 25:09.399
just played high school teams. And didn't go on the 
road much? No, not on the road. In the varsity, of

25:12.746 --> 25:18.497
course you did, but the freshmen you didn't play. 
Did you get any benefit? You didn't get a

25:22.042 --> 25:24.905
basketball scholarship or anything that fresh in 
here? No, no. I sort of got this for you that you

25:25.766 --> 25:29.831
might be interested in. Let's see if I can find it.

25:39.083 --> 25:39.844
Let's see here.

25:50.202 --> 25:52.885
About how many were on that freshman team? On the 
freshman team, we had been about 12 or 15,

25:52.905 --> 25:58.151
something like that. And how tall were the tall 
boys? The tall boys were probably six feet at that

26:02.316 --> 26:07.722
time. Here's something I'd cut out. Fish cages 
defeat thrall-high tigers. And it says,

26:15.042 --> 26:23.779
Creighton midget forward from Louisiana started 
the game off with a bang by scoring the first goal on

26:15.042 --> 26:23.779
a perfectly executed tip-off signal. And then 
later on, in

26:23.799 --> 26:33.878
my junior year, Of course, I cut this out. It said, 
the A&M basketball team always turned out to be the

26:37.261 --> 26:42.627
dark horse of the season. After dropping seven of 
the first eight games, the Aggie quartet beat the

26:42.667 --> 26:56.440
TCU Frogs in a thrilling game, upset the dope when 
they easily outclassed SMU by a large scoring

26:42.667 --> 26:56.440
margin, and then they almost took the Texas U 
Longhorns in one of the most thrilling finishes of

26:42.667 --> 26:56.440
the season. Few will deny a minute more would have 
seen the Aggies take the lead. Jack Creighton's

27:00.284 --> 27:06.032
last two shots of the game stand out as one of the 
highlights of the season. And you had asked me how

27:06.693 --> 27:08.756
that happened. I later on played with an Army team, 
and we played an exhibition game against the world

27:08.776 --> 27:17.968
champion Celtics, and I was the high point man of 
the team. My goodness. Thank you, thank you. Oh,

27:21.974 --> 27:23.115
that's splendid. For you as a freshman, About when 
did basketball workouts start and during the

27:28.752 --> 27:32.898
season? They started early. The basketball 
season started, I'd say, in September and went

27:35.242 --> 27:46.199
through December, I'd say. For you, in your 
outfit, did being on the basketball team get you

27:46.239 --> 27:53.070
any advantages? Oh yeah, it sure did. And then 
varsity, you ate at the training table during the

27:55.297 --> 28:01.887
season, and you got steaks and so forth. You didn't 
as a fish. As a fish, you had no special privileges,

28:04.031 --> 28:16.190
but you had a training table at Sabisa Hall where 
you got special food, steak from now on in, you

28:04.031 --> 28:16.190
know. Let's go back to your fish year. Describe...

28:22.735 --> 28:26.961
Describe a typical day that first semester, a 
class day. What time did you get up? What did you do

28:28.703 --> 28:29.825
when? Take me through a whole day of a typical fish 
day in the fall of 1930. What would this be, 33? 33,

28:37.556 --> 28:38.197
33. Reveille,

28:38.477 --> 28:48.051
I think Reveille was at 6 o'clock, and a bugle of 
blue Reveille. You farmed outside, marched to the

28:48.031 --> 28:55.909
mess hall, and had breakfast, marched back. You 
cleaned up the room

28:57.112 --> 29:02.885
orderly floor. I was the room orderly floor. for 
Charlie Swanson, and I cleaned up his room, made

29:05.952 --> 29:28.112
his bed, and

29:05.952 --> 29:28.112
washed the mirror, and scrubbed out the toilet, 
and saw that his room could pass inspection if it

29:05.952 --> 29:28.112
needed to, and then had to do the same thing for my 
own room. After that, while you went to class, I

29:28.514 --> 29:44.292
think class was, I don't know exactly what time 
classes started, but at 8.30 and 9 o'clock, and you

29:28.514 --> 29:44.292
usually had three classes in the morning. Then you 
broke for lunch, and you came back and you marched

29:45.253 --> 29:48.957
to the mess hall again. Came back to your outfit, 
marched to the mess hall. And then after lunch,

29:52.021 --> 29:57.627
while you had usually lunch, labs. Classes are 
labs, but labs were all in the afternoon. And the

30:04.480 --> 30:09.690
usually labs were two or three hours. And then 
after labs, or after the afternoon session why you

30:15.427 --> 30:32.493
had some some free time and then you again marched 
to the mess hall for supper and then fish had to be in

30:15.427 --> 30:32.493
the hold at 7 30. I remember that so they I forget 
what the bugle call was, but they sounded the bugle

30:40.064 --> 30:43.989
call at 730. You had to be in your hole, and actually 
inspections were made by the senior officers to be

30:44.029 --> 30:53.842
sure you were in your hole. And then I think TAPS was 
at 11 o'clock, I think. But it lights out then. It

31:03.371 --> 31:05.594
taps. And it was a full day. And you also had 
physical education as one of your obligations.

31:18.468 --> 31:24.094
And if you were on a
