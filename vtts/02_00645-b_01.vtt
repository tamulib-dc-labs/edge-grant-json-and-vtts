00:00.031 --> 00:10.433
1.30 with Professor Willis Pequenot, 
P-E-Q-U-E-G-N-O-T.

00:12.377 --> 00:18.310
Present interview, Robert Calvert and Professor 
Pequenot.

00:22.880 --> 00:37.915
Professor Pecklenaut, what we would like to know 
is what took you to Berkeley in 36 as a science

00:22.880 --> 00:37.915
major, where I understand you stayed through a PhD 
in 42, and what direction or what influence led you

00:22.880 --> 00:37.915
to a degree in what appears to be environmental 
science? Yes. I went to Berkeley in 36. I left

00:44.541 --> 00:51.368
Berkeley actually in 36 as a result of the fact that 
They had established a marine science program at

00:51.922 --> 01:03.680
La Jolla, California, as a matter of fact, around 
the turn of the century. By the time I went there, it

01:03.720 --> 01:09.689
was very well known, and it was beginning to be 
called Scripps Institution of Oceanography. But

01:09.709 --> 01:18.823
actually, it was the zoology department of 
Berkeley that established this laboratory. I had

01:19.124 --> 01:23.771
come to know some of the men who were on the staff at 
Berkeley. And I thought they were excellent

01:24.973 --> 01:29.179
people, and so I went up there to study with them. 
While there, I had always at that time to keep in

01:29.660 --> 01:39.174
mind where one could get a job, because the 
Depression was still having an effect in

01:29.660 --> 01:39.174
California. And so I drifted into other 
departments. I took some work in agriculture. I

01:46.816 --> 01:52.044
did some work in soil chemistry to prepare myself 
for that civil service area. I took work in

01:53.165 --> 01:56.551
vertebrate zoology, marine zoology. And so the 
University of California had no major for me. And

01:59.996 --> 02:03.541
as a consequence, they created one, which they 
called environmental science. And thus, I got the

02:04.422 --> 02:07.387
first degree that they ever had. And maybe they 
haven't had another one since of this type.

02:12.494 --> 02:16.300
Actually, I was going to stay on. and I have to 
correct one point on your statement, at Berkeley

02:16.803 --> 02:43.419
for a Ph.D., but it happened that a teaching 
fellowship opened up at UCLA, and they were just

02:16.803 --> 02:43.419
then, in 1937, given the authorization to grant 
Ph.D.s in zoological science. So I... They

02:47.026 --> 02:50.591
offered me a teaching fellowship down there. And I 
was advised by the head of the department at

02:51.573 --> 03:12.763
Berkeley that these were very hard to come by, and 
it might be a good idea to go down there for a

02:51.573 --> 03:12.763
master's, particularly since I could study with 
Loy Holmes Miller, who had been a member of the

02:51.573 --> 03:12.763
Science Party on the Albatross, which had made an 
oceanographic cruise all through the Gulf of

03:13.402 --> 03:18.887
Mexico and in the Pacific region. And so I went down 
to work with Loy Holmes Miller in 37, and it became

03:20.429 --> 03:35.783
very evident that I might be the only PhD he would 
ever have since he was approaching retirement. He

03:35.843 --> 03:39.527
was head of the zoology department down there. And 
for many other reasons, I decided to stay on. So I

03:43.142 --> 03:50.594
got both my master's and PhD at the University of 
California, Los Angeles. At that time, UCLA was

03:50.614 --> 03:56.823
the parent institution for Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography. And as a consequence of this, we

03:57.704 --> 04:06.578
had men coming from Scripps to teach courses in 
marine science, and I became an assistant to

04:06.895 --> 04:20.915
Martin Johnson, who was a zooplankton specialist 
at the Scripps Institution at the time. Also,

04:20.935 --> 04:24.080
Sverdrup was then director. He came up. I got to 
know him very well. Roger Rebell was then working

04:26.964 --> 04:32.312
his way up gradually. I had first met Roger Rebell 
when he was a geologist at Scripps back in 32, I

04:32.933 --> 04:42.002
think. And so it was just a natural event that I 
became more and more interested in marine aspects

04:42.023 --> 04:55.737
of biological science. And at the same time, I 
became the assistant to Professor George

05:01.621 --> 05:15.614
McGinnity of Caltech, who also came to, he was one 
of the foremost marine ecologists. He came to

05:15.634 --> 05:18.017
offer coursework. And it's my interest in marine 
science why it was natural that I would become his

05:18.037 --> 05:25.824
assistant. As a result of all these things, I

05:30.680 --> 05:35.128
decided that this might be the thing for me to 
specialize in. In 1940, I was invited to go to

05:36.050 --> 05:42.862
Pomona College as an instructor. And they had a 
marine laboratory at Laguna Beach, California,

05:44.305 --> 05:54.223
which had been established

05:54.912 --> 06:02.458
Soon after, University of California at Berkeley 
had established their marine laboratory at .

06:02.478 --> 06:02.899
Pardon me. Can we do something? I don't know if the 
secretary has gone or not. Sure. Hello? And so I

06:09.905 --> 06:24.177
began teaching

06:09.905 --> 06:24.177
courses in marine ecology and marine 
invertebrates in the summer of 1940, which I

06:09.905 --> 06:24.177
continued at Laguna Beach. until 1946 when I went 
to the University of Chicago for a time in 47. And

06:30.592 --> 06:43.171
then came back and was invited to teach at the 
California Institute of Technology Marine

06:30.592 --> 06:43.171
Laboratory at Corona del Mar. Meanwhile, I kept 
associations with people at Scripps. And in 55, I

06:48.759 --> 06:55.108
went on to become a research associate down there 
while I was on leave and also a consultant to a large

06:55.544 --> 07:11.963
vitamin corporation who were interested in 
developing natural vitamins from marine

06:55.544 --> 07:11.963
organisms. And at that time, I went to Europe for 
these people to get a large oceanographic vessel

07:11.983 --> 07:20.353
built. somewhere in Europe, finally ended up in 
Germany after

07:20.789 --> 07:35.587
long excursions through Holland and 
Scandinavian countries and so on. So that

07:35.607 --> 07:47.522
I kept this activity going until 1960 when I went to 
the National Science Foundation and then was

07:35.607 --> 07:47.522
invited by people here to come to become an 
oceanographer in the Gulf of Mexico region. I had

07:53.804 --> 07:57.949
never thought of really calling myself an 
oceanographer, actually. And when I came here, I

07:59.471 --> 08:08.263
found that there was no knowledge of the deep ocean 
in the Gulf, and so I began to specialize in that.

08:08.283 --> 08:16.193
And we're just completing the first major report 
on that, and I'm preparing a book on the deep

08:16.831 --> 08:21.099
aspects of the Gulf of Mexico.

08:22.662 --> 08:26.029
So that's a quick run through that. I came here in 
1963.

08:31.038 --> 08:38.232
Meanwhile, I had gone to, for very short periods of 
time, I became head of the Department of biology

08:38.903 --> 08:48.034
with particular interest in marine science at 
State University of New York at Stony Brook. I

08:49.576 --> 08:55.663
resigned in protest there because they had fired 
the president, so I didn't stay very long. I went

08:55.683 --> 08:58.286
back to NSF. Oh, was this 62, 63? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. 
It's an interval in there that I don't like to

09:02.022 --> 09:07.249
remember because it looked like such a promising 
thing. They were getting ready to establish a

09:07.269 --> 09:23.550
major marine installation on Long Island Sound, 
but I felt that they had unfairly fired the

09:07.269 --> 09:23.550
president and appealed to Nelson Rockefeller, 
and he turned the appeal down. But some years

09:23.730 --> 09:31.320
later, he admitted he had been misadvised and He 
made reparations to the president, who had left,

09:32.127 --> 09:41.101
of course, and wrote letters of apology to most of 
us who had protested. But it was too late then. I

09:42.464 --> 09:43.846
wasn't going back anyway. What was he fired? For 
what was he fired? Presumably for being

09:47.772 --> 09:54.523
relatively incompetent in terms of the future 
development of the university, that he was

09:54.824 --> 10:10.165
attempting to do it much too fast, that he wasn't an 
orderly individual, while he was a statistical

09:54.824 --> 10:10.165
thermodynamicist and he was loaded with 
intellect, so there was no problem. It was just

10:10.225 --> 10:12.568
internal jealousy. After I came here, I found this 
was a little bit of a problem area. There was a good

10:19.566 --> 10:22.009
deal of dissension in the department. And since I 
was the newest member, I was asked to be acting head

10:22.029 --> 10:31.879
of the Department of Oceanography and 
Meteorology for presumably six months by Rutter.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.261
I had come here to get away from the 
administration. If I'd wanted that, I could have

10:34.341 --> 10:36.443
stayed at NSF. But Earl Rutter, who was then 
president,

10:43.137 --> 10:52.412
insisted, really, that I do this as a very personal 
favor for six months when it lasted for two and a

10:43.137 --> 10:52.412
half years, which was... Well, we have it 63-64. 
Well, I actually can't remember now. I think it was

10:59.103 --> 11:00.586
till 66. I think I left it in July of 66, whenever 
Dick Geyer came. I think he came in 66. In 66. True.

11:10.222 --> 11:14.527
Then you didn't come specifically to build the 
Department of Oceanography here at A&A? No, I did

11:14.587 --> 11:15.448
not. I came to really develop ocean-going 
biological oceanography because when I came

11:16.189 --> 11:29.546
there was one microscope in the Department for 
Biological Use. Al Syed had been here working on a

11:30.427 --> 11:37.596
project on the Mississippi Delta At the time, he 
had not started with the Antarctic. Macken had

11:41.969 --> 11:51.338
been the biological oceanographer, and 
apparently he had left with some kind of ill

11:41.969 --> 11:51.338
feelings going on. And as a matter of course, 
whether he took things to biology or not, I don't

11:51.478 --> 11:56.763
know. But at any rate, there was nothing here to 
work with, so we had to sort of build things up a

11:56.783 --> 12:03.810
little bit. But meanwhile, the Alaminos arrived, 
and under the the guidance of Hugh McClellan, the

12:08.187 --> 12:14.338
Alaminas was outfitted as a research vessel. John 
Lyman was then head of the oceanography program at

12:15.320 --> 12:24.896
NSF, and it provided, I think, roughly a million 
dollars for the job. And I think that Dr.

12:25.738 --> 12:32.710
McClellan, who's a physical oceanographer now 
with Sea Grant, did really an excellent job of

12:33.432 --> 12:35.395
refitting that vessel. As a matter of fact, I 
personally feel it's a much better vessel than the

12:35.535 --> 12:38.920
gyre. I don't know whether you say these things or 
not, but I really think it was one of the nicer

12:40.742 --> 12:47.612
ocean-going vessels. It had its problems, but it 
certainly was a good oceanographic vessel.

12:54.942 --> 13:01.431
But as always, remember that oceanography, prior 
to the Second World War was wholly physical

13:01.850 --> 13:06.416
oceanography. There were some geological 
aspects to be sure, but including that as a

13:07.137 --> 13:12.204
physical fact. So that people such as Martin 
Johnson, who was then at Scripps, had to fight for

13:14.066 --> 13:26.763
every day they got aboard a ship in order to sample. 
And as a consequence of this, I think that most

13:32.528 --> 13:42.062
ships were outfitted for physical activities and 
not for biological activities. If I had been here a

13:42.162 --> 13:57.304
year sooner, it could have been modified because I 
became a very, well, McClellan and I became good

13:42.162 --> 13:57.304
friends and he was willing to listen, but it was too 
late to modify. Now, when you speak of being

13:58.094 --> 14:02.739
outfitted for physical versus marine, exactly 
what do you mean? No, marine biological.

14:07.345 --> 14:10.929
Well, there are many things that biologists need. 
They need much more workspace on the aft section of

14:10.949 --> 14:15.895
a vessel. Most of the equipment

14:17.036 --> 14:26.127
had to go over on the starboard forward quarter of 
the vessel. whereas it would have been much nicer

14:26.647 --> 14:32.895
had we been able to put things over directly from 
the stern. As it was, I had to fairly lead cables

14:33.015 --> 14:39.863
along the side of the vessel at great distances. Of 
course, when I was working in the deep water, as

14:39.903 --> 14:46.010
deep as I could go, and furthermore, you see, we 
should have had a bigger winch. They only had

14:46.051 --> 14:52.438
30,000 feet of 7-16ths cable on the vessel. It 
would have been nice if we'd had 40,000.

14:57.342 --> 15:04.592
and probably gone to half-inch cable, we could 
have reached deeper aspects of the Caribbean. But

15:05.333 --> 15:13.325
we had five or six miles of wire out, obviously, 
when we were dredging the bottom. Of course, it's

15:15.568 --> 15:16.890
the basis now. That collection is the basis for the 
systematic collection in this department, which

15:16.950 --> 15:24.160
my wife is now curating, fortunately. But I have it 
scattered from the air base to private storage to

15:24.393 --> 15:31.359
this area, plus the collection. And it'll be some 
years before it's completed. When the first work

15:35.283 --> 15:51.278
was done in the Gulf of Mexico by Louis Agassiz 
aboard the Blake, he had 70 people to aid him in the

15:51.545 --> 15:56.090
small deep sea collection that he put together. 
And we've had on the average of two or three. And

16:00.295 --> 16:06.563
we've had a collection perhaps 75 to 100 times the 
size of his. So we've had a little go. But we have

16:08.044 --> 16:15.493
just put out a major report on the upper 
continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico.

16:15.963 --> 16:31.248
And as I say, I'm deep in the manuscript now of one 
that will cover the abyssal aspects of the Gulf of

16:15.963 --> 16:31.248
Mexico and northern Caribbean. Is this all 
encompassing now? Does that cover all the species

16:32.550 --> 16:37.538
that you're finding or are you restricted to 
certain types, certain sizes? No, the work that

16:37.739 --> 16:41.665
we're doing is total. In other words, we have What 
we've done on the currents, what we have done as

16:43.267 --> 16:53.697
biologists on the sedimentology, what we have 
done from fishes to sponges. So it is all

16:54.158 --> 16:56.240
encompassing. We're trying to create an 
ecosystem approach, ecosystem analysis as well.

17:01.786 --> 17:06.390
So it is a thoroughgoing ecological look at this. 
We are not able to quantitate as we would like to,

17:07.091 --> 17:13.257
but we do have a quasi quantitation in, you know, we 
know roughly the size of these dredges we've been

17:14.148 --> 17:23.839
using, or trawls. I used a trawl that was 20 meters, 
had a 20 meter gape, and had Chinese V-boards that

17:24.640 --> 17:37.375
weighed about 750 pounds apiece. And the net 
itself was about 30 meters long, so it was a

17:37.395 --> 17:43.902
gigantic thing to handle, you know, in deep water. 
But we managed to do it. Deep water sampling is a

17:46.750 --> 18:00.191
little bit trying because it takes perhaps an hour 
and a half to get the trawl on the bottom and may take

17:46.750 --> 18:00.191
as long to bring it back up. As a matter of fact, I got 
it caught on some rocks in the deep aspect of the

18:00.211 --> 18:10.547
Columbian Basin in the Caribbean. all but about 
300 feet of wire out, and I was caught on the bottom.

18:17.859 --> 18:28.876
And the profiler, the precision depth recorder 
profile, showed that I was hooked on the rock wall

18:17.859 --> 18:28.876
of this basin. And it took me eight hours to release 
it. I didn't leave the winch control forward, and I

18:32.903 --> 18:38.712
had to pull the ship backwards all the time, 
because my winch was more powerful than the ship.

18:42.026 --> 18:52.979
And so I could stop the ship, and with that thing 
caught on this gigantic wall, which was, oh, I

18:42.026 --> 18:52.979
don't know, it must have been 8,000 or 9,000 feet 
high. The water was about 14,000 feet there deep, I

18:55.381 --> 18:59.106
think. Well, I worked eight hours, and of course 
that's in the trade winds. I had to keep pulling the

19:03.851 --> 19:08.817
ship back against these steady swells coming in, 
And the swells would break on the aft end of the

19:09.185 --> 19:16.758
vessel, and it was 180 feet long, and that thing 
would come flying clear on over. Spray would fly

19:16.798 --> 19:18.841
clear over onto the bridge. So I never had a 
friendly word with the captain after that day. But

19:25.913 --> 19:32.003
at any rate, I got it off, and interestingly 
enough, it had three new species of animals in it.

19:32.776 --> 19:44.209
And it had rocks which had never been seen in the 
Caribbean before, and for which several

19:32.776 --> 19:44.209
expeditions had gone there to find, costing 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. And in this one

19:44.269 --> 19:49.696
accident, we got that set of rocks. We published a 
short paper on it, but others have gone down there

19:49.716 --> 19:55.122
now and have taken those samples. Well, do we have a 
breather to see where we're going? Oh, we know

20:00.046 --> 20:01.508
where we're going. Do you consider yourself a 
generalist rather than a specialist? I was

20:05.972 --> 20:07.494
reading your publication list. This possibly 
answers part of the question. Yes, well, I think my

20:10.416 --> 20:18.644
broad background does explain some interests. 
You see, I started out, actually started out

20:19.605 --> 20:26.712
getting an interest in biological things because 
of the fact that I traveled with a group of students

20:27.468 --> 20:38.380
led by a biologically inclined professor in 
Riverside on the desert for at least three years.

20:38.500 --> 20:45.628
And I got to the point where I knew every shrub and 
animal on the desert. So this was in the period from

20:46.890 --> 20:55.399
about 29 to 33, somewhere in there.

20:56.881 --> 21:09.158
Then, when I went to UCLA, I decided that I needed to 
get some terrestrial biology, so I studied the

20:56.881 --> 21:09.158
biology of an entire mountain range. Was that when 
you were a ranger in 39? No. That was as a result of

21:11.942 --> 21:22.917
that work, I was invited by the Park Service to 
become a trainee to take a position with the

21:11.942 --> 21:22.917
National Park Service in Washington. And they 
wanted me to start by going first to Yosemite

21:27.458 --> 21:42.853
National Park and then to Lassen Volcanic to learn 
both the biological and the physical, since

21:27.458 --> 21:42.853
Lassen, of course, was then still considered an 
active volcano. But as a result of these things, I

21:45.196 --> 21:51.702
was very fortunate. I took ornithology with one of 
the really great ornithologists of the West,

21:57.209 --> 21:59.211
Joseph Grinnell. I took plant physiology with one 
of the great plant physiologists of his time at

21:59.892 --> 22:05.258
Berkeley. And I took genetics with men that were 
foremost and was even invited to be an assistant to

22:05.278 --> 22:20.736
Theodosius Dobzhansky, who just died, who was one 
of the leading geneticists

22:22.640 --> 22:25.944
from Columbia University and then to Caltech. I 
met Thomas Hunt Morgan, who was one of the really

22:26.726 --> 22:39.182
important geneticists who introduced 
Drosophila fruit fly as the genetics vehicle. I

22:40.344 --> 22:50.638
became very good friends with George Beadle, who 
Beadle and Tatum were the first ones to do the one

22:51.125 --> 22:58.115
gene, one enzyme, one gene theory for which they 
got the Nobel Prize. And I'm not bragging about it,

22:58.135 --> 23:02.501
but it just happened. These people fell into my 
life, and they inspired me to read very broadly in

23:02.521 --> 23:14.438
biological science. And as a consequence of these 
experiences, have had to become a generalist.

23:23.923 --> 23:38.136
I've been interested in anything that would fit 
into a better understanding of the machinery that

23:23.923 --> 23:38.136
drives the natural systems.

23:38.156 --> 23:45.263
So I think that this also started through one 
course, and I sometimes do feel that students can

23:46.441 --> 23:53.611
be inspired by a course, although many of them feel 
no longer this kind of feeling. I took a course in

23:53.692 --> 23:58.178
the history of science at Berkeley. And that 
course, which drew specialists from all over the

23:59.179 --> 24:13.360
country to lecture in their areas, whether it be 
medicine, pharmacology, biology, physics,

23:59.179 --> 24:13.360
whatever, was one of the most inspiring courses I 
ever took. Now, the book itself was also that way.

24:20.730 --> 24:27.136
Obviously, if you're tracing the history of 
science, you realize how general the people were.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.799
Certainly, Aristotle is the epitome of that. But 
even coming up after the Renaissance, you've got

24:29.839 --> 24:34.965
the generalist. And of course, analytical 
specialist so much in sway when I was going to

24:43.040 --> 24:48.267
university. But it was in the 40s that people began 
to realize that analytical approach to science

24:48.287 --> 24:57.099
was no longer going to work. And it was for this 
reason in the biological area that ecology came

24:57.119 --> 25:03.748
into its own. There are still people here who 
debate whether ecology is a science. They just

25:10.918 --> 25:12.220
don't have any a fundamental knowledge of 
intellectuality when they asked that question.

25:20.373 --> 25:25.480
Synthesis became the word beginning in the 40s. At 
the same time, there were those who were working

25:26.942 --> 25:37.735
not only in molecular biology, but beginning at 
Caltech to work in sub-molecular biology. Now it

25:38.305 --> 26:00.904
was because of George Beadle, who was then 
chairman of the biological division of Caltech,

25:38.305 --> 26:00.904
that Crick and Watson came to Caltech and 
synthesized their knowledge to get an insight

25:38.305 --> 26:00.904
into DNA, which of course set genetics off in a 
whole new area. So that was about the 52 period, 53

26:01.694 --> 26:04.738
period in there. George Beadle's still alive. You 
know, he went to become president of the

26:07.261 --> 26:11.245
University of Chicago. He's now doing, still 
doing interesting work in genetics on corn, which

26:12.146 --> 26:20.937
turns out to be an exciting vehicle to study. It 
doesn't seem like it would be, but genetics of corn

26:20.957 --> 26:27.364
takes you all over, you know, because obviously 
it's I'm going to not comment on that. That's

26:29.885 --> 26:33.249
getting out of oceanography. One quick question. 
Do you think that oceanographers are more

26:34.010 --> 26:40.418
inclined to be generalists than, let's say, 
specialists?

26:44.463 --> 26:45.844
Yes, I feel so. And I feel this is very natural. We 
are still following what was laid down in scripts

26:49.909 --> 26:56.237
years ago as to the curriculum in the early years. 
And this by its very nature indicates that if

26:56.757 --> 27:07.628
you're going to understand the ocean as a system, 
you've got to know something about all aspects of

26:56.757 --> 27:07.628
the ocean. The answer, therefore, is that those 
who have come through the oceanographic

27:08.689 --> 27:17.959
curriculum generally are more inclined to a broad 
view. Those who have come from engineering,

27:18.479 --> 27:23.845
however, tend to be highly specialized. And we see 
this in this department, even. And you see it

27:27.745 --> 27:33.632
almost in every major institution where 
engineers have entered the field.

27:35.174 --> 27:48.891
So that I would say, though, that those who go 
through oceanography as a curriculum tend to be

27:35.174 --> 27:48.891
much broader in their perspective than those 
who've entered from a single discipline. Just

27:48.911 --> 27:51.013
happened, my training was very broad. And so it was 
natural that I should come there. But I put out a

27:55.259 --> 28:03.191
little paper on currents because I couldn't find 
anybody who would know anything about the

27:55.259 --> 28:03.191
currents in the bottom. The time I wrote that 
paper, there weren't many who believed there were

28:03.211 --> 28:08.339
any currents in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. 
Here, for example, I did something with geology

28:08.579 --> 28:15.550
because I needed to know something about that 
aspect. Go ahead with your question, maybe. No,

28:19.365 --> 28:22.047
I'm fine.
