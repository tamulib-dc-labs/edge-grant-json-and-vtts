00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:07.026
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:09.805
Hello, hello, hello.

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:15.437
This is September the 20th.

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:31.557
I have the pleasure of interviewing old friend and colleague Garland Bayless about his many years, close to 40 now, of being part of the A&M community.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:40.028
Garland, to begin with, to help anyone who might listen to this tape or read the transcription,

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:45.093
who might not know you, describe your background before getting to A&M.

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:53.722
Where'd you grow up, family, high school, college, military experience, and so forth?

00:00:56.725 --> 00:01:01.209
I grew up in McGee, Arkansas, in the southeastern part of the state, so-called Delta.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.454
It's cotton, corn country.

00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:07.956
We became soybean and rice.

00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:22.468
in my college career at Arkansas A&M in Monticello, down at the University of Arkansas in Monticello in the fall of 1942.

00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:26.637
And that was that year of 1942.

00:01:26.617 --> 00:01:35.771
As all of you know, the war was pretty well underway by then, and we'd sit around the dorm trying to decide which way to jump rather than be drafted.

00:01:37.214 --> 00:01:44.966
Many of my friends chose to go in the Army, end up in the Army STP program, which is similar to the Navy B-12.

00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:54.160
I chose the Navy B-12, and it was set up that you would finish your degree and then go to Naval Officer School or so-called the Shipping School.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.216
Well, as the war progressed, that played out and they established what they called the five semester.

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:04.324
You had three, you got two, you had two, you got three.

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:07.491
Then you went to the Navy Midshipmen School.

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:15.595
I was selected to go to the one at Columbia University in New York City and talk about culture shock.

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:37.107
Go from southeast Arkansas, the largest town I'd ever seen at age five was New Orleans, and I go to New York in the spring of 1944 after having completed five semesters in New York and Arkansas.

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:54.032
And received orders to go to California to pick up a transport ship.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.513
And so I rode the train all the way from New York via McGee to see my mother, the rest of my family, then on to San Francisco.

00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:08.421
And there I picked up the USS John J.H.

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.848
McRae AP-149, which was a Navy transport.

00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:16.988
You've heard the expression, you join the Navy to see the world.

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:25.356
In the years aboard that vessel, we steamed right at 150,000 nautical miles, which is a lot of water.

00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:27.458
At least that's what I was told.

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:29.680
I did not measure it.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:41.552
And I put those years transporting troops to the United States, to Australia, to New Guinea, to Kenyan, to Timor.

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:55.710
towards being in the news lately, to the Philippines, back to the States, through the Panama Canal, went to France, picked up troops there.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:12.653
Well before that, back through the Panama to New York and picked up troops and took them through the Suez Canal, through the Persian Gulf and up to Iran, brought troops back.

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:18.989
back through the Suez Canal, and then we all set up going to Calcutta.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:29.393
I don't need to tell all of that, but we spent a lot of time at sea, twice in France, once to Iran, once to India, the Philippines, etc.

00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:31.035
Now this began in what year?

00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:33.017
Your active duty?

00:04:33.598 --> 00:04:36.521
No, the shipboard activity began in October 1944.

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:43.430
Prior to that I'd been at Arkansas Union and at Columbia University in midshipman's school.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.393
And you were how old when you went on?

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:50.638
I was 19, I was 20 when I was commissioned.

00:04:51.648 --> 00:05:03.752
And it was rather ironic, I had enlisted people who were in their 40s and 50s and you have to sort of play the game there that you don't pop up and say, well I'm Ensign Bayless, you do so and so.

00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:07.659
We had a few Ensigns who tried that and didn't work very well.

00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:13.150
But after joining the Navy and seeing the world, I was discharged.

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:23.300
Wait just a second, where were you when you heard the news about the bomb, the A-bomb and the end of the war then in Japan?

00:05:24.922 --> 00:05:34.573
We picked up in Lahore, France elements of the 9th armored and huge army medical outfit.

00:05:35.354 --> 00:05:43.002
We were heading to the Panama Canal to take them to somewhere in the Pacific.

00:05:43.758 --> 00:05:45.020
We had not been told yet.

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:57.361
When the war was over, after dropping the bomb, the word was passed, those ships that already tranced in Panama would continue their destination.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:01.668
We were about mid-Atlantic, so we were diverted to Norfolk, Virginia.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.217
And when that word was passed, and remember these guys had already been fighting in Europe,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.509
They were now being taken to fight, to invade Japan, is what the ultimate goal was to be.

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:20.202
And when word was passed on this ship, it was about 17,000 ton, had almost 3,000 troops on board.

00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:24.650
Their sight was such that from my view, that ship rocked.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.876
At least it felt like it was rocking.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.344
And so we were diverted to Japan.

00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:36.199
I said, Norfolk, I think it was New York.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.965
I might point out that recently we saw this movie, Storm at Sea.

00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:46.870
I mean, that's something in the movie about that fishing vessel.

00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:48.972
The perfect storm.

00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:55.079
And it reminded me because on that trip, we were going to New York, not Norfolk, excuse me.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.243
We ran into the heaviest seas that we'd ever seen.

00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:04.093
And in normal steaming of 24 hours, we would do about 420 nautical miles.

00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:13.167
On 124 hours, as best we could calculate, we made 11 nautical miles for the rest of the time.

00:07:13.628 --> 00:07:17.914
We kept them bound in the sea and just hoped that we did not turn over.

00:07:18.715 --> 00:07:23.262
And that was probably the worst experience that I ever had at sea.

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:27.829
Plus it was winter and cold and icy and all that kind of good stuff.

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:43.137
but that's where we were at Mid-Atlantic when the word was passed and there was joy beyond measure, not only for our crew but also for the members of that.

00:07:43.157 --> 00:07:55.656
Shortly after our ship tied up in New York and I was transferred to the Navy Yard at Brooklyn for duty to decommission vessels as they came in.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:05.701
Of slight interest, the first one I did was a reverse Lindley's LST coming back from the British Navy.

00:08:06.222 --> 00:08:10.729
And that was my first encounter with the British Navy.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.171
I take that back.

00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:13.352
We saw them in Calcutta.

00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:22.025
But where I had to go aboard and meet the CO and say, I'm here to take control of this vessel for the United States Navy.

00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:23.247
I won't go into it.

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:28.528
but they did not leave that vessel in very good shape.

00:08:28.548 --> 00:08:36.778
On our ship, our crews complained all the time because there's constantly chipping paint getting the rust out and painting.

00:08:36.798 --> 00:08:46.450
This ship was in terrible shape, but that's how I finished my active duty career was at the Brooklyn Navy Shipyard decommissioning other vessels.

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:55.427
When I was discharged, as I en route home, I went by Kansas City, Missouri to see a ship made.

00:08:56.888 --> 00:08:57.949
Chicago, Kansas City.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.952
Then to Portsmouth, Arkansas.

00:09:00.972 --> 00:09:06.937
I got on a bus and rode up to Fayetteville to enroll in the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.

00:09:06.957 --> 00:09:11.522
Then went home and then I finished my undergraduate at the University of Arkansas.

00:09:11.562 --> 00:09:12.282
Majoring in?

00:09:13.504 --> 00:09:14.985
Zoology and chemistry.

00:09:15.303 --> 00:09:21.909
I was one of the millions and millions and millions who started as pre-med and decided that was not for me.

00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:31.839
Got through there, went back home to McGee, Arkansas, taught public school one year, tried to settle life insurance and starved to death.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.483
My brother had gone to Orange, Texas to work for DuPont.

00:09:36.503 --> 00:09:38.365
He called and said, why don't you come here?

00:09:39.586 --> 00:09:44.871
So I went to Orange, worked for DuPont as an operator helper, decided

00:09:45.323 --> 00:09:47.827
that I did not want to do shift work the rest of my life.

00:09:49.049 --> 00:10:04.231
Meantime, I met my future wife, Mary Evelyn Futrell, and we decided to get married and for me to go to Austin to go to graduate school to pursue a master's of all things in history, because at that time I had nine hours of history.

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:08.678
And then that evolved into the PhD program.

00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:15.027
Then in 1955, we went to Charleston, South Carolina to talk one year at the Citadel.

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:28.046
And after that academic year, I came to Texas A&M in the fall of 1956 and have been here since my first retirement in 86 from full-time and part-time.

00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:32.152
Went back in the department part-time until 91 and retired.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:33.934
That's been a long time ago.

00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:37.799
All right, the connection with A&M.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.084
How did you and A&M have this connection?

00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:43.768
How did you know there was a vacancy?

00:10:43.828 --> 00:10:45.570
What contact was made by whom?

00:10:47.727 --> 00:11:00.168
My last year of graduate studies at the University of Texas, Professor Ralph Steen, who was the head of the department at A&M, was a visiting prof at UT when I got to know him.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:07.720
I did not have a class with him, but we talked then some about maybe at A&M in the future.

00:11:08.922 --> 00:11:09.904
I went out to the Citadel.

00:11:10.728 --> 00:11:20.597
He called me and said, Garland, if you're coming, this is the time because the legislature just passed a law requiring six hours of American history.

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:22.860
And that year, Ralph hired five people.

00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:26.923
And he was the department head by then.

00:11:27.364 --> 00:11:29.266
And so he hired me from the Citadel.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:37.073
So I was Citadel only one academic year, and I was reluctant to leave after one year.

00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:45.299
I also felt if I wanted to get back to Texas and the Texas A&M, I better come then, because that wasn't an opportunity.

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:49.067
The year at Charleston was very fine, a lovely city and a fine school.

00:11:50.289 --> 00:11:57.604
As far as you recall, did Dr. Steen interview you in any manner?

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.888
No.

00:12:02.332 --> 00:12:31.225
in austin at ut but did i come down for an interview he just offered me the job on the phone well by letter and uh what was the this is the only dollars and cents question what was the beginning salary i think it was 3 200. i might go back for nine months when i was trying to get a job and leave ut and wanted midwestern

00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:46.251
in Wichita Falls, went in at Arlington State in Arlington, and you had a very good friend there who called Walter.

00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:51.659
Walter said, Mr. Bagus, would you like to be considered for that job?

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.381
I really don't remember how I learned about the Citadel.

00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:00.992
And ended up with an offer from Arthur.

00:13:01.985 --> 00:13:07.674
But one thing that made it attractive to Charleston was a different part of the country.

00:13:08.495 --> 00:13:14.544
But as important to us, I think the offer was $2,700 there.

00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:20.994
But they had faculty housing, and you paid $3 a room.

00:13:21.775 --> 00:13:23.638
A seven-room apartment was $21 a month.

00:13:23.718 --> 00:13:25.601
Does that come out right?

00:13:26.062 --> 00:13:27.224
Three times seven is $21.

00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:29.427
It was in downtown Charleston.

00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:31.963
in the old Citadel.

00:13:33.205 --> 00:13:37.431
That's what made it especially attractive.

00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:47.085
But then, I guess it was mid-spring semester when Ralphstein called and asked if I would be interested in being in it.

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:52.333
Describe the physical move from Charleston to Brazos County.

00:13:52.393 --> 00:13:54.156
What did you bring and how did you bring it?

00:13:54.997 --> 00:13:57.220
What were your belongings at that time?

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.645
Well, I think I ought to go back to leaving Austin for a little while.

00:14:01.013 --> 00:14:05.498
And also we were living in student housing.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.925
And we had a chambers range, if you've ever seen a chambers range.

00:14:12.466 --> 00:14:18.874
Paid $300 for it, now they're antiques worth 1800 or so I've seen.

00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:22.799
And a bed and a couch and whatever.

00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:29.907
If you've ever seen a wooden van, that little bitty part up over the wheels, that's where our...

00:14:32.182 --> 00:14:38.953
From Austin to Charleston.

00:14:38.973 --> 00:14:48.730
Mary was not with me because she was eight months plus pregnant with David, our oldest, and she flew up and never flown in an airplane.

00:14:50.513 --> 00:14:53.818
David was delivered three weeks after she got to Charleston.

00:14:54.389 --> 00:15:07.372
but it was really wonderful there because you immediately move into an environment with faculty housing and there was a built-in support group for a new faculty especially having a baby.

00:15:08.013 --> 00:15:10.378
So with great reluctance we left.

00:15:10.398 --> 00:15:13.343
When we came back,

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:16.529
We had much more room.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.816
I think we'd added a breakfast table and four chairs, and that was about it.

00:15:22.898 --> 00:15:33.731
And so when we came to Bryan, we rented a duplex on Bay Street, and we built a house on West Brookside.

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:35.754
Do you remember what that duplex cost?

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:42.182
I don't think it was more than $60 a month.

00:15:44.592 --> 00:15:46.214
That first house we built was 13-5.

00:15:46.394 --> 00:15:49.278
I still have the contract on there.

00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:51.401
How long before you built that house?

00:15:51.421 --> 00:15:53.564
It was built while we were here.

00:15:53.945 --> 00:15:55.146
I mean right after we got here.

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:55.687
Right, okay.

00:15:56.588 --> 00:16:07.783
And the Orr brothers, the Orr grocery stores with the builders, they also built houses on the side of their father who was a carpenter contractor.

00:16:07.803 --> 00:16:13.671
And then we were in that house until Marilyn's mother and father retired

00:16:15.288 --> 00:16:17.710
from Orange, Texas, where she had been a schoolteacher.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.272
She was a barber.

00:16:19.292 --> 00:16:20.713
And so they moved to Bryan.

00:16:20.753 --> 00:16:28.821
We sold them that house and moved the next block up to another house, which we had built.

00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:38.030
Describe the campus that you, to which you arrived, at which you arrived.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.572
What was A&M then?

00:16:40.592 --> 00:16:43.675
Well, there were about 7,000 students total.

00:16:45.207 --> 00:16:46.970
And that number always sticks in my mind.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:17:04.395
Because in either 82 or 83, when I was talking to freshmen, mothers and fathers, indicated that year we had as many freshmen as we had total students when we came in 1956.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:14.370
Still a concern about the faculty housing surrounding the campus, all those homes that have been moved or destroyed or whatever they have been.

00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:18.015
No air conditioning on campus.

00:17:23.725 --> 00:17:33.463
My office was over in, what is that building they tore down to the left of the library, Burr-Hareton is now.

00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:37.911
The one story red brick building.

00:17:38.937 --> 00:17:39.759
I can't remember.

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:41.582
Started with a B.

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:45.971
It had been industrial arts at one time, but now it was offices.

00:17:47.013 --> 00:17:50.880
History was located in the academic building where the department was.

00:17:52.543 --> 00:17:55.349
And see that year they hired five new people.

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:58.495
I think there were probably six already here, maybe seven.

00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:00.418
So the department almost doubled?

00:18:00.438 --> 00:18:01.300
Almost doubled.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.944
But I'd have to go back and vote.

00:18:03.964 --> 00:18:13.457
There may have been ten faculty, but that year because of the law requiring that five people were hired.

00:18:14.018 --> 00:18:15.620
And it was history and government?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.882
History and government.

00:18:16.902 --> 00:18:22.209
All these were hired to teach history, though some did sometimes teach government.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.954
All of those other, except myself, are not dead.

00:18:28.837 --> 00:18:34.805
Describe who were the senior faculty and what were they like?

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:47.363
Ralph Steen was the department head, probably one of the best classroom people I've ever known.

00:18:47.443 --> 00:18:50.407
In his Texas history, students would almost fight to get in.

00:18:51.849 --> 00:18:58.759
Fight may be a part where they would scheme, do whatever they could to get into this class.

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:06.695
a very kind gentleman, ran the department very well.

00:19:08.277 --> 00:19:13.263
He put up with some of our prima donnas, such as Allen Elson.

00:19:14.324 --> 00:19:18.489
To this day, I still meet people somewhat older.

00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:23.735
Oh, did you know Screamin' Allen Elson?

00:19:23.755 --> 00:19:25.177
And the answer's always yes.

00:19:27.019 --> 00:19:29.202
I liked Al.

00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:39.853
He sometimes got provoked when he thought a classroom was his classroom and someone came in and moved in extra chairs and I've seen him throw them down the hall.

00:19:42.297 --> 00:19:50.311
But whatever people thought about, his students remembered him and those who had him remember him to this day as far as I know.

00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:54.177
What did he most often scream about?

00:19:58.932 --> 00:20:00.954
He wasn't always that sure.

00:20:00.974 --> 00:20:19.275
It was my impression, note that word impression, that no matter what course he was teaching, whether it's 105, which is before the Civil War, or some other course, he always...

00:20:19.655 --> 00:20:23.860
He really came unglued in any attempt.

00:20:26.388 --> 00:20:29.151
discuss Franklin Roosevelt.

00:20:30.973 --> 00:20:32.555
He was a man of strong opinions.

00:20:32.575 --> 00:20:40.625
He was also, as far as I know, he was an ordained Church of Christ... Disciples.

00:20:40.785 --> 00:20:42.427
Disciples, excuse me, of Christ.

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:44.089
Preacher.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.851
I never did hear him preach.

00:20:47.353 --> 00:20:51.959
As you walked down the hall, you could hear him lecturing.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.842
But he was a harsh man.

00:21:03.614 --> 00:21:23.299
David, our youngest, who was now a year or two old and talking, we took with him, with us.

00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:26.182
We walked in.

00:21:26.282 --> 00:21:28.525
He won't know where the horsey was.

00:21:37.212 --> 00:22:05.209
Other colleagues?

00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:06.190
Tom Miller.

00:22:08.482 --> 00:22:23.479
Tom was a short, heavy-set guy, very thick.

00:22:23.499 --> 00:22:38.455
I think Tom always said he was not very true about the administration, not so much about his team as about Dr. Steen's successors.

00:22:39.548 --> 00:22:47.886
His field was Texas history, I guess, principally, though we all covered it every day.

00:22:55.643 --> 00:22:56.224
My gosh.

00:22:58.432 --> 00:22:59.493
Was Claude Hall here?

00:22:59.814 --> 00:23:01.116
Claude came in 54.

00:23:01.556 --> 00:23:03.519
Year before, you came in 56.

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:05.982
So Claude Hall was okay.

00:23:06.063 --> 00:23:07.124
Claude came in 54, I believe.

00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:19.902
Of course, Claude was also a, in a sense, a junior member that certainly became one of the more outstanding senior members in the department.

00:23:21.664 --> 00:23:28.033
So you forgot the next department head after the man who followed us.

00:23:29.228 --> 00:23:31.330
Milton Nance.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:41.642
Rapstein had become president of Stephen F. University in Nacogdoches, and J. Milton Nance became the department head.

00:23:41.902 --> 00:23:44.225
Milton also was a very interesting man.

00:23:45.306 --> 00:23:50.532
There's Rapstein's style of management, I think, even more.

00:23:50.552 --> 00:23:50.973
I hesitate.

00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:52.574
I like the word consensus building.

00:23:53.215 --> 00:23:54.797
He was certainly a man who

00:23:56.515 --> 00:24:02.546
who both tended to be more hard-nosed, tended to be, I am the department head.

00:24:04.891 --> 00:24:10.341
No such thing as department committees in the sense of tenure, promotion, things like that.

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:14.469
And I'm not always sure that's the best way to do it.

00:24:14.489 --> 00:24:16.853
Sometimes, at least from my viewpoint,

00:24:17.187 --> 00:24:27.881
The department head making the decisions, at least in my observation, has not always been that much worse than committees making decisions.

00:24:33.107 --> 00:24:35.610
Milton and I socialized some, our families did.

00:24:36.331 --> 00:24:42.159
We had children about the same age, exchanging birthday parties and so on.

00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:47.025
He was, though under...

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:54.177
Ralph Steen, we were expected to be here virtually from 8 to 5.

00:24:55.238 --> 00:24:59.523
The military team were to demand that we be here from 8 to 5.

00:25:00.183 --> 00:25:02.706
Sometimes we were and sometimes we were not.

00:25:03.567 --> 00:25:15.460
Were there any unspoken guidelines that you quickly understood about dress, appearance, conduct, social life?

00:25:16.283 --> 00:25:23.332
Well, you were expected, but it didn't bother me because I expected myself to wear a shirt, tie, and coat to class.

00:25:25.295 --> 00:25:42.598
Frankly, it bothers me now when I see former colleagues not doing that, but I thought that was part of the demeanor of being a professional in the classroom.

00:25:42.618 --> 00:25:45.582
You were expected to be available to your students.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.014
which, honestly, now rarely happens.

00:25:50.497 --> 00:25:59.311
That part I would not quarrel with Ned Charleston about, because it also fit into my own style, and I expected the professor to be available.

00:26:00.232 --> 00:26:02.616
Did faculty members smoke in their offices then?

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:06.102
That I don't remember right now.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.185
I thought when I got here, I thought some of them did.

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:14.729
Pipes and so forth.

00:26:14.749 --> 00:26:20.238
Of course, Charles Wines, he spoke to Pipe.

00:26:20.258 --> 00:26:23.102
Did Al smoke cigarettes?

00:26:23.122 --> 00:26:24.424
I think so, but I don't know.

00:26:24.444 --> 00:26:25.406
No, I'm thinking about Alan Yost.

00:26:25.466 --> 00:26:27.609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:28.290
I think so.

00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:36.443
Who were, who, when you arrived, who taught European, everybody you thought of so far

00:26:37.435 --> 00:26:54.281
When John Hill was here, he taught, remember we didn't offer that much non-American history.

00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:57.987
I think technically Allen Nelson was a Latin American.

00:26:59.769 --> 00:27:02.093
John Hill was a medievalist.

00:27:02.427 --> 00:27:06.931
And I gather he taught whatever European that we had.

00:27:08.092 --> 00:27:13.557
And then coming with?

00:27:13.697 --> 00:27:18.662
At one time, I taught a European course, too, the survey courses.

00:27:19.903 --> 00:27:21.304
I had also taught in the Citadel.

00:27:21.324 --> 00:27:23.046
Who came with you the same year?

00:27:24.087 --> 00:27:29.852
Garland Bayless, Lloyd Taylor, Alan Ashcraft, Wesley Chumley,

00:27:33.072 --> 00:27:35.056
I said, not Wines.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:45.816
He stayed two or three years, and then he went to Southwest, San Marcos, Southwestern.

00:27:45.836 --> 00:27:48.661
He didn't die, not Wines.

00:27:48.842 --> 00:27:52.048
Charles Wines came the next year, two or three years later.

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:54.793
Let's see, John, what about John Hill?

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.236
John Hill was here when I got here, but he left Charlotte to go to Houston.

00:27:59.317 --> 00:27:59.737
I see.

00:27:59.918 --> 00:28:02.261
I'm numerically his replacement.

00:28:02.582 --> 00:28:04.946
And he taught medieval, didn't he?

00:28:04.966 --> 00:28:05.166
Medieval.

00:28:05.186 --> 00:28:05.407
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:05.427 --> 00:28:06.869
But he went temporarily.

00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:11.196
To the U of H for a year and then stayed, yeah.

00:28:12.178 --> 00:28:13.660
But he stayed.

00:28:14.939 --> 00:28:19.327
What were your assigned duties the first few years?

00:28:19.347 --> 00:28:21.552
Each survey.

00:28:21.752 --> 00:28:28.064
How many sections and how many students were normally in those sections?

00:28:28.244 --> 00:28:31.190
Anywhere from four to five sections.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:37.622
And the classes were Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday mornings and Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

00:28:37.973 --> 00:28:48.672
Describe your style of teaching.

00:28:49.433 --> 00:28:54.121
The way you did the classes.

00:28:57.928 --> 00:28:59.931
What did you expect of the students?

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.592
What kinds of tasks and grading system?

00:29:04.173 --> 00:29:07.576
I expected attendance.

00:29:07.596 --> 00:29:12.801
I think sometimes I was teased off and told them, one, I expect you to be here on time.

00:29:14.463 --> 00:29:17.726
I encouraged them to be prepared.

00:29:17.766 --> 00:29:21.369
That wasn't always possible.

00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:28.416
I'd often tell them that three Fs, three Fs made an F and three tardies made an F.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.852
in answers.

00:29:30.872 --> 00:29:36.560
I don't know that I ever carried it out, but I told them that I did not believe in using the curve.

00:29:37.982 --> 00:29:40.646
I did not grade on the curve.

00:29:40.666 --> 00:29:48.497
And whatever the standard was, whether it was 90 up to an A or 94 or whatever, I thought it wouldn't care for me.

00:29:50.941 --> 00:29:55.053
Quiz time, I generally tend toward essays.

00:29:55.916 --> 00:30:01.873
After that, I have the larger classes, a combination of multiple choice and essays.

00:30:02.876 --> 00:30:04.782
In all senior courses, I retire.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.362
They were all essays.

00:30:06.862 --> 00:30:14.974
I know you'd use them for, let's say, exams, internal papers, knowledge and graduate courses.

00:30:14.994 --> 00:30:20.522
Describe the, in the first years, in the survey classes, describe the students.

00:30:22.024 --> 00:30:22.645
All core.

00:30:27.151 --> 00:30:31.717
Journey receptive.

00:30:31.737 --> 00:30:32.899
Respectful servant.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.022
Almost all freshmen.

00:30:35.592 --> 00:30:43.343
You'd have an occasional, someone who'd put it off, but you were always, you were always freshmen.

00:30:43.523 --> 00:30:46.888
Obviously during bonfire time, they were tired than usual.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:54.298
I sometimes wasn't too sympathetic.

00:30:54.318 --> 00:31:02.089
I know people don't like to hear war stories, but I reminded them that while at sea, if you had the watch from 8 to 12,

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:08.322
and you went to bed at 12.30, you roughed your journal quarters at 5 to 5.30.

00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:15.560
And I would sometimes suggest that at your age, all you need is four hours sleep a night anyway.

00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:19.048
So I'm not really interested in...
