WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:07.937
In the afternoon and sitting in the nice, nice 
living room. Cluttered. No, I didn't say that.

00:10.841 --> 00:18.849
Looking out into the backyard, talking to Mrs. 
Rutter about her memories of some great years

00:10.841 --> 00:18.849
here. And now we're going to stop and see if the 
machine is working. If you want to go back to

00:23.074 --> 00:26.157
Austin, if that's important, I can name a few. All 
right, let's begin by, Mrs. Rutter, by you telling

00:26.963 --> 00:38.058
me and this machine and anybody that would listen 
to this material later about your growing up.

00:38.138 --> 00:41.463
Where did you grow up and go to high school and so 
forth? Oh, that's a long story. I grew up on a ranch

00:44.106 --> 00:49.113
in Menard County after having come from a ranch in 
Sutton County. My dad bought that ranch in Menard

00:50.095 --> 00:54.861
County from G. Raleigh White's youngest brother, 
Johnny. in 1927, but I had a brother that still had a

00:55.735 --> 01:06.239
senior year in Sonora, and so we didn't move down 
there until the following year. And this was, I

01:07.902 --> 01:13.575
said, I've said it's kind of in the middle of 
nowhere.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.123
It's in the middle of several small towns. It's 21 
from Mason, Texas, 23 from Menard, 26 from

01:18.244 --> 01:23.991
Junction, and 36 from Brady. So that's where I grew 
up. I did all the things that kids did at that time.

01:29.398 --> 01:32.683
At the age of 12, I rode a horse to school. 14 miles 
round trips, seven there and seven back, to a

01:34.085 --> 01:38.871
little school in London. I said, sounded pretty 
good to say you went to school in London for two

01:39.138 --> 01:45.347
years, but when you said you rode a horse to get 
there, it didn't sound so good. And then when I was

01:46.669 --> 01:55.441
14, my mother wanted me to go to a little larger 
school, which wasn't very large at that, which

01:46.669 --> 01:55.441
would have been Menard, 23 miles. So they bought me 
a little Ford Sport Roadster with a rumble seat,

01:55.481 --> 02:00.609
and I thought I was about the cutest thing around. 
Green. I drove to school at the age of 14. We didn't

02:05.015 --> 02:07.879
have to have a driver's license then. And that was 
in Menard? Mm-hmm, I went to school in Menard. You

02:11.765 --> 02:13.129
graduated from high school there? Mm-hmm. How 
many in your senior class? 36, and I was number one.

02:16.741 --> 02:17.745
You were number one of 36? Yeah. And this is what 
year? 1932. 1932, and then you go off to college? To

02:25.535 --> 02:27.699
University of Texas at the age of 16. I was so young, 
I didn't realize how young I was. But I got along

02:32.326 --> 02:33.869
fine. I served two years on student government, 
and I was present at the dormitory I lived in, a few

02:35.432 --> 02:43.705
odds and ends. Had, you know, a lot of nice friends, 
but I don't really keep up with them now. It's not

02:49.396 --> 02:50.457
like A&M. Did you know John and Nellie Connolly? 
Yes, yes. He was on student government, too. Jake

02:57.725 --> 02:59.007
Pickle was my good buddy. Describe them as college 
students. Oh, John and Nellie, that was a glamour

03:02.750 --> 03:06.835
pair of the university. He was so good-looking, 
and she was pretty, and... She was the

03:12.372 --> 03:13.674
university's sweetheart. That's what I heard. 
And of course, he was. Was he present in the student

03:16.518 --> 03:18.001
body? He was present in the student body, but not 
until after I was out. I guess he must have been in

03:24.030 --> 03:25.252
law school. When I got there as a freshman, Alan 
Shearer was present in the student body. And he was

03:30.520 --> 03:31.361
a good one. And it's so funny that the politicians 
came from that group then. Now there's more Aggies

03:37.351 --> 03:40.776
than UT. But let's see, John Connolly was Jake 
Pickles, chairman of his election committee. I

03:52.282 --> 03:52.923
don't know. I'm not thinking straight. When Jake 
ran for student body president, John was his

03:54.926 --> 03:59.172
campaign manager, is what I'm trying to say. And 
then John was president of the student body the

04:00.174 --> 04:03.939
next year. But Jake, of course, went around with 
little Pickles. No, they had real pickles at that

04:08.305 --> 04:11.728
time, real pickles. And he still has these little 
plastic pickles he pins on his lapel. And we're

04:15.811 --> 04:16.812
still good friends. We used to pick Jake up when he 
was hitchhiking from Big Spring to Austin. He was a

04:22.417 --> 04:23.178
poor boy. Now, when you went to the university, 
what was your major and what did you think your

04:23.938 --> 04:28.122
career was going to be? Let's don't talk about 
that. It's funny. I had a brother-in-law who had

04:30.664 --> 04:36.649
graduated there two years before I went, and he's 
the one that influenced me. And I was a tennis

04:37.591 --> 04:39.501
player. Can't believe that now. But I did, and I 
didn't quit playing tennis 1973 suddenly I

04:44.273 --> 05:12.475
couldn't get around over the court so I majored in 
physical education although I had never had a

04:44.273 --> 05:12.475
lesson in it in my life but I played tennis that was 
it and I my brother-in-law said well and he knew

04:44.273 --> 05:12.475
that I wasn't greatly fond of math or foreign 
language you didn't have to have those for that

04:44.273 --> 05:12.475
major you had to have sciences but you didn't have 
to so anyway that's what I did and I graduated from

04:44.273 --> 05:12.475
UT

05:14.243 --> 05:16.327
I had been 20 less than a month. And that was too 
young to get it. Well, Earl had come down when I was a

05:20.135 --> 05:22.861
senior and told me to apply. They were putting it on 
in Brady where he was coaching football at the

05:22.881 --> 05:26.989
time. And I almost didn't get the job because of my 
age and I hadn't had any experience because they

05:27.991 --> 05:34.665
were putting this department on. But anyway, I 
taught it in Brady. About midsummer, he had gone

05:39.239 --> 05:45.054
down to check me out down there, the 
superintendent had, and decided he'd hire me. So

05:47.019 --> 05:48.041
this is 1930? 1936. You mentioned this young man, 
Earl. When did you first meet him? Oh, gosh, I was a

05:55.659 --> 05:58.244
freshman at UT. We started dancing together at the 
dances, that's all. How did... I knew who he was

06:02.292 --> 06:06.159
because he was in Tarleton when my older brother 
was. See, Earl was six years older than I. And... My

06:11.332 --> 06:14.517
brother would bring his annuals home, and Earl was 
captain of the football team. Good-looking Lord,

06:14.897 --> 06:17.481
I thought he was something else. And so I didn't 
have to be introduced to him. And he knew that I was

06:19.544 --> 06:21.867
my brother's little sister, you know. But I was a 
freshman, and we started dancing together. And

06:26.153 --> 06:34.285
then from that, I guess when I was a junior, he 
started asking me for dates in summertime and

06:26.153 --> 06:34.285
holidays, things like that. So you, when you were 
back home? Yeah, when I was back home. All right,

06:39.363 --> 06:41.988
now he was, by that time he was... Coaching 
football in Brady. When he first got out of A&M in

06:44.572 --> 06:49.380
1932, he couldn't find a job. He dug ditches for the 
highway department. They were building a road

06:52.646 --> 06:55.851
between Eden and Menard. and he was digging 
ditches for 25 cents an hour now his major was what

06:56.708 --> 07:25.602
industrial industrial education yeah but he 
didn't he didn't use that either any more than i i

06:56.708 --> 07:25.602
taught one year and at that time uh they wouldn't 
hire a married teacher in brady and i guess you know

06:56.708 --> 07:25.602
if you your husband was employed by the school 
system and so i taught one year and i I made the grand

07:26.257 --> 07:30.923
sum total of $900, just made $100 a year for nine 
months. You didn't teach in the summertime, so you

07:31.284 --> 07:33.747
didn't get any money in the summertime. And if it 
hadn't been that my parents paid my first month's

07:34.629 --> 07:42.560
room and board, bought my father clothes, I'd have 
been in the hole. I came out with $40, which I spent

07:43.241 --> 07:47.707
before we got married the 12th of June. And he had 
exactly $80. We got married on $80 in faith. My, my.

07:53.976 --> 07:58.622
So you all got married at the end of your first year 
out of the university. In June the 12th of 1937. And

08:01.166 --> 08:03.670
he was the football coach. Was he the head coach at 
Brady High School? At Brady. Or was he the only

08:07.495 --> 08:09.798
football coach? Well, he had one substitute. I 
mean, one assistant. I don't know why I said

08:12.883 --> 08:14.385
substitute. But now they have got the biggest 
coaching staff, and I bet you there's no more

08:14.405 --> 08:19.332
players. But he made, I think, the grand total of 
$135 a month for nine months, just like I got paid

08:19.312 --> 08:27.604
nine months. But, you know, and we didn't think 
anything about he worked long hours, I worked long

08:27.624 --> 08:33.012
hours. They had me, I was so young and full of life at 
that time, hard to remember, that they made me

08:33.853 --> 08:42.446
sponsor of everything they could think of. I had 
never played volleyball, but I got to sponsor the

08:42.586 --> 08:49.116
volleyball club, which met before school, had to 
be up there at 7.30 in the morning. And then after

08:50.311 --> 08:53.716
school in the afternoon, I sponsored the pep 
squad. I had to work out all the halftime things.

08:58.002 --> 09:04.471
And at night, I was sponsored a senior class, so I 
had to direct plays and whatever else they had

08:58.002 --> 09:04.471
going. About how many were in the senior class? In 
Brady? Right. You know, I don't remember. It

09:11.220 --> 09:12.742
seemed like a lot. I not only taught in the high 
school, but the junior high. And Mr. Rutter, he

09:17.750 --> 09:21.194
coached, but what else? Football, what were his 
other duties? When he first signed on there to

09:24.719 --> 09:30.986
coach, they gave him five different subjects to 
teach. That was murder. And the couple that he

09:33.209 --> 09:41.479
lived with before his mother moved over there, his 
father died in 1935,

09:42.387 --> 09:46.333
And he had started coaching there in 1933, I guess. 
But

09:47.334 --> 09:57.128
he had to teach all those courses, and one of them 
was chemistry, and he didn't even like chemistry.

09:58.130 --> 09:58.931
Anyway, go ahead. No, I'm just thinking about all 
the duties. All right, when you all got married,

10:02.175 --> 10:07.944
what was your housing accommodation that you 
first lived in? Oh, Lord. Well, we first... had the

10:12.830 --> 10:14.592
hot side of a duplex. I don't really know. I never 
did really know what rent he paid, but it was a

10:15.613 --> 10:21.659
little more than he thought we need to pay. So there 
was a doctor who had a big old two-story frame house

10:22.200 --> 10:28.367
and built a brick, nice brick home. And they turned 
that into four apartments. So we had the upstairs

10:30.329 --> 10:35.254
apartment on the right, and it had one bedroom. And 
then it had a little, I don't know what you'd call

10:35.935 --> 10:41.841
it, but it was over where you drove the car 
underneath the portico shade or whatever. And it

10:43.188 --> 10:43.949
was screened. So we rented out the one bedroom for 
$12 a month to the old maid librarian. And we slept

10:52.962 --> 10:55.145
on that little screened-in porch. Took the flu and 
everything else that way. But that was how tight

10:58.269 --> 11:00.052
money was. Sure. $12. And she shared the bath and 
the kitchen. Because the Depression was still.

11:04.518 --> 11:05.560
And I didn't cook. I didn't know how to cook. And 
Earl loved to eat. He always did. Then we were there

11:09.225 --> 11:12.790
one more year. And he got the job as coach at 
Tarleton. And that suited him just fine because he

11:16.555 --> 11:21.222
put me back in school to learn how to cook. All 
right. And so that's the fall of 39? No, not that far

11:25.930 --> 11:28.174
along. Eight. 38. Or was it? Yeah, 38. Yeah. Yeah. 
And since I couldn't teach, since they wouldn't

11:32.761 --> 11:36.988
let me teach regular teaching, After that first 
year, they made me their chief substitute, which

11:37.677 --> 11:42.822
didn't make any sense. And whatever school was 
lacking a teacher, I would go teach it. Now, that's

11:47.867 --> 11:48.668
in Brady? In Brady still. So the last year in Brady, 
that's what I did. Among other things, these

11:53.253 --> 11:58.137
non-paying jobs like chairman of the Red Cross 
Drive and stuff like that. I don't know. They found

11:59.459 --> 12:01.601
things for me to do, so I wouldn't be idle. Now, I 
presume Brady was receptive to a new young lady,

12:02.742 --> 12:07.667
though living there. they were oh they were brady 
was always a nice little friend of the town that's

12:07.985 --> 12:33.064
what i would and g raleigh white he had the most 
interesting family see there were four men

12:07.985 --> 12:33.064
raleigh was the oldest raleigh charlie willie and 
johnny johnny was the one that my dad bought the

12:07.985 --> 12:33.064
ranch from his his headquarter ranch and then they 
had two sisters mrs wall and mrs wolf mrs wolf was

12:33.517 --> 12:36.962
the youngest in the family, and she was a lovely 
person. And when she heard that Earl and I were

12:37.603 --> 12:40.668
gonna get married, she had me come over. And she 
said, now, Margaret, I have a wedding arch, and

12:40.688 --> 12:56.251
I've forgotten the number exactly, 30-something 
couples have married under that arch, and I want

12:40.688 --> 12:56.251
you and Earl to get married under it, because 
nobody has ever parted ways that got married under

12:40.688 --> 12:56.251
my arch. So my dad came in in the pickup and picked up 
the arch, and they had the florist decorate it, and

12:56.611 --> 13:02.680
we married. at the ranch. We had a very small, well, 
my mother had just been in Scott & White in Temple

13:04.252 --> 13:10.219
for a long time. And my sister, she had a 
miscarriage. She got up the day of our wedding. And

13:17.188 --> 13:19.130
so I pretty well engineered my own wedding. I had 
to. And so I thought, I'm not gonna, in fact, my

13:20.732 --> 13:27.840
parents had built the house my senior year in 
college. So it was nice and new, so I just decided

13:27.860 --> 13:32.886
I'd get married right there, under Mrs. Wolf's 
arch. And then you moved to Tarleton, and y'all are

13:33.794 --> 13:37.697
in Tarleton how long? We're there from 38 to 41, 
because, see, 41 is when he was called into

13:37.718 --> 13:43.242
service. He had his commission from A&M when he 
graduated in 32. Right, so in those years, in the

13:48.027 --> 13:56.975
30s, after y'all got married, did he go to National 
Guard meetings or anything? Reserve, all the

13:56.995 --> 13:58.376
time. Is that right? Yeah, and every summer that we 
were, every summer, He had two weeks summer camp.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.356
And where was that normally? Well, it could be at 
Fort Hood. It could be at, I can't remember the

14:09.879 --> 14:13.043
place, in Louisiana. Camp, if you said it, I'd say 
that's it. Oh, boy. I can't think. On this side of

14:18.709 --> 14:20.271
Louisiana in the swamp. Yeah. It's not a pretty 
place, I don't think. So he was normally in the

14:24.055 --> 14:25.817
southwest. Yeah. At summer camp. And that, did 
that come early in the summer usually or late?

14:31.856 --> 14:37.722
Yeah, it came, it usually coincided with Jane's 
birthday and Father's Day. Jane felt like she was,

14:37.762 --> 14:43.967
it wasn't very funny for her because her dad was 
never for her birthday. And her birthday was 16th

14:45.509 --> 14:48.131
of June, so that's about the time. At Tarleton, he 
coached football, and what other duties did he

14:48.191 --> 14:51.935
have? Well, he may have taught a course or two. I 
don't really remember. I guess he did, but... He

14:58.962 --> 15:03.827
mainly coached, and that's where we were when our 
first son was born.

15:07.350 --> 15:13.016
We were there from 38 to 41, at our first home there. 
And he was so ready to go into the service that he

15:13.316 --> 15:20.363
sold that home before he even got his orders, and 
that scared me to death. As you look back on it now,

15:22.105 --> 15:26.529
do you think that he enjoyed coaching? Oh, yeah. He 
had a way of working with young people that was just

15:27.987 --> 15:30.810
really good. And did you enjoy being a coach's 
wife? Oh, yeah. The only thing that confused me

15:35.255 --> 15:41.782
about Stephenville was the way they'd dress. 
You'd have a bridge party at night and they'd wear a

15:42.723 --> 15:46.508
long dress, and I couldn't get used to that. My, my. 
Yeah. Now, he had gone to Tarleton... two years, so

15:52.237 --> 15:55.323
this in a way was going back. Going back home. And am 
I correct that people for short called it JTAC,

15:56.565 --> 16:01.775
John Tarleton Agricultural College? That's what 
they called the publication, the little paper

16:01.795 --> 16:05.542
that was put out. Was that right? JTAC. And they may 
have called the school that, I don't know. You

16:09.810 --> 16:12.916
know, other people like Clyde Wells, he went to 
Tarleton. Oh, yes. A lot of people went to

16:13.316 --> 16:15.240
Tarleton. He's called to active duty when? Summer 
of 41. Summer of 41. And he went to Fort Sam,

16:21.953 --> 16:25.096
Houston. And you're left with how many children? 
Well, we just had the one then. And then Ann was born

16:30.462 --> 16:32.084
in 42. Okay. Courtesy of the Army. She was born at 
Fort Sam, Houston. Right. Did you go, where did

16:38.971 --> 16:44.637
you, when he goes to active duty, where did you 
live? With him. I followed him around as far as

16:48.081 --> 16:54.710
where he was until he went overseas. And we lived, 
oh golly, we were in some pretty bad places. We went

17:02.400 --> 17:09.290
from Fort Sam Houston by way of Fort Benning up to 
Camp Atterbury in Indiana, and we were up there a

17:02.400 --> 17:09.290
year. And while we were there, He, in November, was 
sent to command and general staff school. And I

17:19.046 --> 17:24.883
thought the weather was too bad to try to take the 
kids and come back to Texas. And they made it very

17:25.555 --> 17:40.188
plain, they didn't want any spouses or family to 
come with them because they had had to condense

17:25.555 --> 17:40.188
that course down to just a little, like two months 
or so from a much longer course. So I stayed there,

17:41.288 --> 17:44.691
but it was kind of a bad winter. My two little ones, 
see, Ann was only six weeks old when we got there.

17:50.376 --> 17:54.820
Ann Budd was just two years older than that, and 
they both got bronchopneumonia. with him gone, so

17:55.340 --> 17:57.222
it was kind of bad. I've learned in talking to 
youngsters today about the World War II era that

17:59.024 --> 18:20.250
they are astonished that there were no pickets 
against the war, there were no demonstrators, and

17:59.024 --> 18:20.250
that no one doubted who was going to win the war. And 
I do you agree with that with that? Yeah, and like I

18:24.673 --> 18:41.884
say Earl was so Ready to go in and he knew what he's 
getting into That he sold our home before he ever

18:24.673 --> 18:41.884
got his orders Right then when he went overseas you 
went back where I went back to Brady and And lived.

18:43.529 --> 18:47.473
In a little house next to a neighborhood grocery 
store. It was a house that had been bought. See,

18:50.836 --> 18:56.241
Earl in 1935 had bought a drugstore. Everybody 
thought that it was his brother's because Earl

18:56.321 --> 19:02.046
bought it so his brother would have a job. He'd 
gotten one of those little quickie pharmacy,

19:03.467 --> 19:07.951
whatever you get. Didn't have to go and get a degree 
in it at that time. And he didn't have a job. He had a

19:13.087 --> 19:14.529
wife and a little boy. So Earl saw that this came up 
for sale. So he did all the arranging and getting

19:18.593 --> 19:21.857
the finance. And what was so funny about that, and 
I'm getting off the subject, is C.G. Raleigh

19:27.403 --> 19:33.711
White, who'd always been most kind to Earl, he had 
the commercial bank in Brady. He was the bank. And

19:35.982 --> 19:39.927
so Earl went there first to get the loan to put this 
drugstore in. But Mr. White wasn't there, and his

19:40.849 --> 19:44.013
loan officer turned Earl down. So he just walked 
around the square to the other bank, Brady

19:44.734 --> 19:50.061
National, and they loaned him the money. And do you 
know, until he died, he sent every check back to the

19:50.522 --> 19:57.932
Brady National Bank because they had loaned him 
money. And anyway, John was to run it. because he

20:03.033 --> 20:07.961
had his little pharmacy thing, and it didn't work 
out. We learned a lot from that. All right. When

20:13.389 --> 20:14.771
does he go overseas? He went overseas in 1940. I 
could follow 42 or 43 now. Haskell, I'm not

20:22.664 --> 20:24.186
positive on that. It's one or the other, 42 or 43. 
Let's see. Where had we been? Hmm.

20:33.340 --> 20:35.083
You know, I should have written all that down, but I 
didn't. All right, now, is his first combat

20:35.103 --> 20:38.108
experience D-Day? Yeah. Okay, that's 1944. But 
they went, they trained, yeah, sure, but they

20:40.052 --> 20:44.099
trained in England. In England. So it must have 
been fall of 1943 that he went over. All right,

20:48.427 --> 20:54.758
between the time he first went overseas and... 
Well, did you get to see him at all after that first

20:56.257 --> 21:04.386
trip he first went to Europe until the war was over? 
No. I went up. He was at Fort Dix is where they were

21:08.010 --> 21:13.415
before they were sent overseas in New Jersey. And 
he called me to come up there. Earl was really good

21:17.239 --> 21:21.904
at giving orders, and he gave them to me, too. And he 
called... late Wednesday night, and I didn't even

21:25.484 --> 21:28.248
have a telephone yet. I had just moved into this 
little house. And my neighbor came over and got me.

21:33.554 --> 21:37.920
And he called me at her house. And Wednesday night, 
he wanted me at Fort Dix by Saturday noon. And I had

21:47.111 --> 21:48.613
to figure out how to get there. I took my first plane 
ride, but I got bounced off. You know, you had to

21:53.219 --> 21:54.681
have a priority. to be able to fly and of course I 
didn't have one and so anyway I finally got there

21:54.897 --> 22:10.392
but by train instead of plane and I stayed up there 
ten days seeing him before he went overseas. Now

22:12.414 --> 22:18.680
while he's in Europe about how often did you write 
him and he write you? Oh we wrote a lot and I have all

22:18.700 --> 22:23.284
those letters There's a book over there on the 
organ bench now that has two of his letters printed

22:24.631 --> 22:31.901
in it. When they had this exhibit, I guess it 
started out in 1990. Ann and I went down to the

22:36.627 --> 22:43.136
luncheon in the LBJ Library. And it was there for 
about three or four months. Then they made the

22:47.462 --> 22:48.824
rounds. And see, people from all over the United 
States had something in that exhibit. And then

22:54.820 --> 22:59.744
they made the rounds of all the presidential 
libraries in the country. Ended up in the National

23:00.585 --> 23:05.450
Archives in 1995, maybe. And then I got them back. 
But they asked me what value I'd put on those for

23:09.513 --> 23:14.037
insurance. I said I wouldn't have any idea. So they 
put $1,000 each. And I've forgotten what value

23:18.802 --> 23:22.465
they put on the picture of Earl they used. I want to 
chat with you about those later, but let's

23:23.002 --> 23:26.726
proceed. So did you write him once a week? Oh, more. 
More than that? More than that, yeah. And about how

23:31.431 --> 23:32.653
often did he write? He was good at writing, except 
when he was in the middle of the Battle of the Bulge.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.665
See, Earl was in the, of course D-Day was scary 
enough. He went in with 225 men, and you know that

23:44.846 --> 23:48.891
story, I'm sure. And end of the first day, this 90 
could bear arms. I mean, it was murder, because the

23:52.143 --> 23:58.350
British guide boat had started out taking them to 
the wrong point and made them late. Anyway, after

23:59.831 --> 24:05.377
that, it was so spectacular. And it was published 
by the War Department in a little book called Small

24:05.517 --> 24:14.787
Unit Actions, where they figured, picked four out 
of the war. And that was number one in the book.

24:20.950 --> 24:48.477
anyway then he was also in the Battle of the Bulge oh 
yeah see that that was so spectacular what had

24:20.950 --> 24:48.477
happened on D-Day that they gave him a much larger 
command regiment in the 28th division infantry

24:20.950 --> 24:48.477
division and they had just come out of the Battle of 
the Hurtgen Forest see he was given command of this

24:20.950 --> 24:48.477
regiment on the 8th of December and on the 16th of 
December this was 1944 the Germans started their

24:49.115 --> 24:52.079
last counteroffensive, which was the Battle of 
the Bulge. And they were right in the thick of that

24:53.001 --> 25:00.332
because they were thinly spread, and I'm sure the 
Germans were able to determine that. And so they

25:00.372 --> 25:09.626
came marching through, and Earl's regiment was on 
the southern part of this arc. It was the 109th

25:11.128 --> 25:12.410
Regiment. It was on the southern part. Then the 
110th was in the center, and it was practically

25:14.093 --> 25:18.379
annihilated. And the 112th was on the top part of 
the arc. And so they came marching through. And

25:24.831 --> 25:34.544
Earl's regiment was given credit for blunting the 
German attack, because they just pivoted and dug

25:24.831 --> 25:34.544
in and camouflaged. It was snow. And the Germans 
came marching up.

25:41.748 --> 25:46.232
It said it was kind of similar to don't fire till you 
see the whites of their eyes. And when they got up

25:46.793 --> 25:49.095
close, then they fired on him. He gave the command. 
And I did have all kinds of articles about that from

25:50.957 --> 25:58.083
the Philadelphia Inquirer because it was a 
Pennsylvania outfit. And they said something

25:59.284 --> 26:05.070
about 2,500 Germans lay bleeding in the snow. 
Anyways, pretty much of a battle. All right. With

26:09.274 --> 26:10.675
you back in Brady, When did you first learn that he 
had been involved in the invasion? Yes, ma'am.

26:17.950 --> 26:19.393
Okay, I can tell you exactly. When I was up in New 
Jersey for that 10 days before he left to go

26:21.296 --> 26:32.755
overseas, we were with this cute couple from, both 
were native New Yorkers, Alice and Jerry Wilkin.

26:33.416 --> 26:36.882
Jerry was one of Earl's officers in the Ranger 
Battalion. And Alice and I got to be fast friends in

26:37.013 --> 26:44.100
that 10 days, because we'd go into Philadelphia 
one night, the four of us, and then New York another

26:37.013 --> 26:44.100
night. We just had a real good time. And she and I 
just hit it off. She was younger than I. But she

26:50.066 --> 26:52.868
worked in New York, and she talked about her. In the 
summertime, she got a two-week vacation. So I

26:56.292 --> 26:59.495
asked her, why didn't she come to Texas and spend it 
with me? So she decided she would. So I had just

27:01.376 --> 27:03.639
picked her up in San Antonio. She flew in down 
there. And we'd spent the night at Randolph,

27:05.887 --> 27:12.035
because my college roommate and her husband were 
out there. And then we went on over to Austin, and we

27:13.136 --> 27:17.662
were in the Stephen F. Austin Hotel right there on 
Congress Avenue. And about 3 in the morning, the

27:18.623 --> 27:25.852
newsboys down below were yelling, extra, extra, 
read all about it. I don't know that they even do

27:26.252 --> 27:27.654
that anymore. I don't think so. And so I got up, 
threw something on, went down, got a paper. And I

27:34.810 --> 27:44.520
said the thing that was so different from now, we 
couldn't find a place to find a radio that wasn't in

27:34.810 --> 27:44.520
TV. And we went up and down Congress Avenue trying 
to find a place that we could listen to the radio to

27:45.501 --> 27:50.286
see what was going on. We finally ended up in the 
back of Leon's shoe store. And we listened to it for

27:55.811 --> 27:57.793
quite a while. And then we got in the car and drove on 
to Brady. That's where I was living at the time.

28:03.667 --> 28:07.793
Now, did you know that his unit was in it? Oh, 
without a doubt. We knew that they were in it. And we

28:11.839 --> 28:15.163
did not know that her husband was almost killed 
that first day. Earl was wounded twice. He got shot

28:16.425 --> 28:17.747
through the leg. I've got pictures that he sent me a 
little snapshot where he's got on shorts. And he

28:24.116 --> 28:32.087
said, if you'll notice, just about six inches 
above the left knee, you can still see the scar

28:24.116 --> 28:32.087
where the bullet came out. Well, you can. But then I 
had this other picture where he's standing in his

28:33.611 --> 28:38.796
uniform up on top of the cliff. And on that same leg, 
same place, there's that blood. So I put the two

28:43.401 --> 28:45.643
together. But anyway, Jerry was almost killed, 
her husband. And she didn't find it out until she

28:50.087 --> 28:53.291
got home, got back to New York. Now, when did you, do 
you remember how long it was before you got a letter

28:53.871 --> 28:58.956
from him after D-Day? Was it a week or a month or? It 
was probably about the time, the first ones in that

29:02.999 --> 29:07.565
book, it just said somewhere in France. It didn't 
say where. And actually, the San Angelo paper was

29:09.508 --> 29:17.118
the paper out in that area. And so Alice and my two 
little ones and I had gone out to my sister-in-law

29:18.160 --> 29:25.430
because my brother was on Saipan. And she was there 
with her two little ones. And we were Always good

29:32.075 --> 29:32.976
friends. Pat died last year. But anyway, she was a 
grade ahead of me in high school. And we liked to go

29:40.122 --> 29:42.204
out there. She was a lot of fun. And so a fella in 
Menard called me, real nice fella, had a grocery

29:44.846 --> 29:52.152
store there, asked me if I'd seen the paper. And I 
said, no. He said, well, your husband's picture's

29:52.833 --> 29:55.875
on the front page that he's been wounded. I said, 
oh, golly. So went in, got the paper. She lived 18

30:00.399 --> 30:01.660
miles out. And it didn't say how badly or anything. 
Of course, that worried me. And then that same day,

30:09.050 --> 30:17.738
invasion,

30:09.050 --> 30:17.738
he kind of set up his command post in one of the 
German bunkers. And I guess it must have been a

30:19.300 --> 30:23.683
shell from one of our ships, and the channel came in 
a little close. One of the ranges wrote that it was a

30:25.885 --> 30:29.769
marker shell because it was real yellow. 
Everything it hit was yellow. But it came in too

30:32.099 --> 30:34.744
close and hit the side of that bunker. And the men on 
either side of Earl were killed. And he was left

30:39.572 --> 30:43.539
standing, but he got shrapnel in his hip and his 
arm. I think I may have a picture of that bunker, but

30:44.521 --> 30:49.089
you don't need to see it, I'm sure. You'll take my 
word for it, won't you? Sure. Oh, yes. When I first

30:52.275 --> 30:54.158
met Omar Bradley... in 1980 after we got to El Paso. 
I wondered if he was in El Paso. Yes, ma'am. He was in

30:59.955 --> 31:01.737
a wheelchair by then. Oh, yeah. Had his stroke. But 
he was still very sharp. Yeah. And he looked up at me

31:05.802 --> 31:08.746
and said, you're from A&M. Yes, sir. Did you know 
Earl Rutter? Yes, sir. Worked with him. His voice

31:12.972 --> 31:21.563
then broke a little, and he said, in 48 years of 
command responsibility, I never gave a more awful

31:12.972 --> 31:21.563
order. than the one I gave to him the morning of 
D-Day, because if they hadn't succeeded, we would

31:22.032 --> 31:29.864
have had a massacre on both beaches. Well, in his 
book, A Soldier's Story, he says that. No soldier

31:32.949 --> 31:39.019
in my command has ever been wished a more difficult 
task than that which befell this 34-year-old. I

31:39.039 --> 31:40.902
know the thing by heart. And it was. It was 
something. All right, then, so it goes on through

31:45.314 --> 31:50.846
the Battle of the Bulge. When do you see him after 
the war is over? I don't remember it. It's funny, I

31:57.660 --> 32:01.388
don't remember the exact date.
