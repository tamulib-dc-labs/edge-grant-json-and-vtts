WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:12.055
after the

00:03.727 --> 00:12.055
invasion in North Africa. I thought I was going to 
be in on that invasion until I found out that the

00:12.916 --> 00:28.471
13th Field Artillery from Fort

00:12.916 --> 00:28.471
Bragg, North Carolina. Now We fired our guns the 
first time.

00:38.025 --> 00:42.570
We got new guns and I fired them the first time in 
Europe. But,

00:45.194 --> 01:00.413
sitting there at Camp Sutton, we were at one end of 
the big field range up at Fort Bragg. So the minute I

01:01.760 --> 01:17.294
got those guns,

01:01.760 --> 01:17.294
they were different from the French GPFs with 
which this cavalry regiment had been issued for

01:01.760 --> 01:17.294
training. Now these boys that I inherited were 
cavalrymen, horse cavalrymen. And the officers

01:25.622 --> 01:30.366
were all very fine horsemen and swordsmen. and 
could run the courses for shooting pistols and

01:31.055 --> 01:36.882
this and that and the other. And to take a regiment 
like that and take their damn 16 ounce sabers away

01:38.564 --> 01:59.830
from them and give them 16 ton guns of an obsolete 
French vintage and in order to shoot those French

01:38.564 --> 01:59.830
guns you had to build a storm cellar, dig a recoil 
pit as deep as a storm cellar in Kansas

02:00.755 --> 02:14.138
before you shoot them. And now to expect trained 
horse cavalrymen, horsemen over a long period of

02:14.158 --> 02:25.277
time, to come in and be good artilleryman, like 
that. Well, of course, it can't be done. Now,

02:31.988 --> 02:43.338
when they, in the, in the... National Guard? Yes, 
in the National Guard, there's a lot that they can

02:45.620 --> 02:50.745
learn at home. And what they learn at home, is 
really just a school teaching job with exercises

02:55.328 --> 03:06.239
on the weekend to get some degree of practicality 
into it. Just a laboratory exercise, see. Now,

03:11.745 --> 03:24.778
right today, the average National Guard unit 
could go on the range up here, now assuming that

03:11.745 --> 03:24.778
they have the same equipment and most of them do. If 
they have the same identical equipment and the

03:26.852 --> 03:35.101
same identical, when I say equipment I mean range 
finders.

03:39.085 --> 03:53.500
They can go up there and they can shoot those guns 
just as good as those guys that have been sitting

03:39.085 --> 03:53.500
around for several months waiting for it to become 
seasonable. and also you've got to be a good

03:54.543 --> 04:00.351
guardsman. You've got to keep up on your reading, 
your techniques. So, and those people, and they

04:08.082 --> 04:15.031
do, they can go there. So, they were well prepared. 
give them the same. Now they may be a little slower

04:18.030 --> 04:35.634
doing it than the guys that have done that and 
grabbed the round of ammunition where it's laying

04:18.030 --> 04:35.634
every time he's been on the field and slam it in the 
reach of the gun. Some of the guns are still sitting

04:35.674 --> 04:40.200
where they were before they were last shot. At 
least they were when I was at the school.

04:47.041 --> 05:01.676
So when it comes to the intelligence of the 
techniques of doing a thing, the guardsmen know it

04:47.041 --> 05:01.676
just as well as the regulars. Sometimes a damn 
sight better. I have one last question for you. And

05:08.322 --> 05:15.850
that is, when and why did you retire from the 
Wisconsin National Guard?

05:20.437 --> 05:23.340
for the simple reason that I had reached the age of 
sixty.

05:26.423 --> 05:29.967
So, I thought it was a good time to quit.

05:34.371 --> 05:36.453
That's when I first became eligible. I never 
thought a National Guardsman would ever get any

05:36.573 --> 05:41.298
retired pay. That's a post-war

05:43.080 --> 05:48.385
thing, but When I was sixty I was on the job and 
joined it. So, I would have stayed another year

05:57.349 --> 06:16.971
even though I didn't have to or had reached the, it 
was not, I could have gone to age sixty-four. But

06:17.828 --> 06:19.811
you thought it was a good time for you to retire 
then? Well now look, a good friend of mine named,

06:19.831 --> 06:46.907
a

06:19.831 --> 06:46.907
good friend of mine that was colonel of the other, 
one of the other regiments in the original 32nd

06:19.831 --> 06:46.907
Division, he had been detached from the 32nd 
Division with not only himself but the whole

06:47.140 --> 06:52.926
regiment off to a place over here. Now I did have a 
choice.

06:58.812 --> 07:11.865
When they triangularized the division,

06:58.812 --> 07:11.865
the man who supervised the triangularization

06:58.812 --> 07:11.865
was a general

07:18.747 --> 07:24.893
I know the name until I have to say it.

07:24.913 --> 07:26.035
But anyway, he stayed on. Clemens, Clemens, 
Clemens. Brigadier General Clemens was at 61, was

07:28.037 --> 07:40.590
according to the division command, according to 
Herman

07:28.037 --> 07:40.590
the German. Kruger. Kruger. according to 
Krueger, he couldn't go overseas. So, he says now

07:48.330 --> 08:10.192
the major general was about a $75,000 a year 
lawyer,

07:48.330 --> 08:10.192
and Milwaukee

07:48.330 --> 08:10.192
in those days was pretty close to the top. You had to 
have a terrific set of clients. But you could have

08:14.741 --> 08:22.511
continued if you wanted to, but you just made up 
your mind that you were not interested in it. Well,

08:23.232 --> 08:36.389
if I had stayed on

08:23.232 --> 08:36.389
another year,

08:23.232 --> 08:36.389
this guy's name was Bridester, Fritz Bridester. 
Fritz Bridester was a graduate of West Point. He

08:41.502 --> 08:45.587
was captain of the football team. He was one of the 
great athletes. You can go up there today and look

08:48.411 --> 08:55.641
at their trophies at West Point. In the period that 
Prince Bridgestone was there, he was the great man

08:55.661 --> 09:06.676
on the field and in soldiering and everything. He 
was a big fella. He went and after West Point he

09:10.898 --> 09:30.185
stayed in the Army a couple or three years and 
married

09:10.898 --> 09:30.185
one of the very wealthy families of Milwaukee. And 
his wife and her family had barrels of money and

09:30.205 --> 09:39.758
they provided the yeast. That was one of the things 
they provided for all the beer that was made in

09:40.885 --> 09:47.173
Milwaukee. Well, that's a pretty good monopoly. 
Yeah, that sure is. And that was just one thing they

09:53.101 --> 09:55.324
provided. But he could have had to retire? He was 
forced into retirement in Wisconsin? Well, after

10:01.272 --> 10:09.323
he marries this gal, instead of doing like a lot of 
guys, saying, well,

10:12.138 --> 10:16.930
And he says, I owe the government something. So he 
joined the National Guard and he too came in as a

10:16.950 --> 10:21.421
captain. With the West Point diploma he was 
certainly more qualified than I was.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.024
and we'll make you a captain." You see the guard can 
trade on the guy of ability like that, whereas the

10:36.044 --> 10:42.691
regular army can't. But the guy, they say you're a 
second lieutenant and you're going to be a second

10:43.932 --> 10:53.341
lieutenant for the next X number of years until so 
and so. Well if a guy like Fritz Breitster, he was

11:00.434 --> 11:05.921
felt an obligation for his education, although 
his family was pretty well fixed, too. And so he

11:07.302 --> 11:15.432
came in, and Fritz was always ahead of me, 
actually, on the list. But in the

11:17.855 --> 11:28.888
matter of warfare, Fritz wound up in a staff job 
under,

11:30.421 --> 11:37.347
out in the, out in the Orient. He wound up on a staff 
job under the,

11:39.009 --> 11:47.777
Denninger Joe. Stillwell. Yeah, one of the 
sorriest damn generals that ever pinned on a star.

11:55.985 --> 11:59.668
But nevertheless, a man that captured the 
imagination. journalism. Why do you say that

12:01.495 --> 12:02.897
about Stilwell? Well that's maybe more than you'd 
have time to listen to. Stilwell was a good old

12:12.272 --> 12:17.420
regular army garrison type soldier. He found 
himself in a situation where he didn't know what to

12:18.863 --> 12:27.917
do, so he decided to just pack up his toothbrush and 
shaving kit, if any, and get out and walk across

12:29.112 --> 12:35.401
Burma.

12:38.185 --> 12:53.567
Well, a real general would have sent a plane in 
here, or they'd have gone to the Chiang Kai-shek or

12:38.185 --> 12:53.567
whatever his name was, that Chinaman He said, I'm a 
general. I got other things to do. Now get me out of

12:58.795 --> 13:00.797
here damn quick. Now that's what a general would 
do. But this good old honest infantryman

13:05.763 --> 13:11.671
had to do the honest thing. I'll walk out with my 
people. See? That's like God damn grandstand.

13:23.005 --> 13:23.385
But it Sure did pay off as far as publicity is 
concerned. And the documents. People writing the

13:31.454 --> 13:41.187
history of the campaign can't avoid the fact that 
Vinegar Joe, he was well known, named. You give me

13:42.809 --> 13:47.736
an army officer's nickname and I damn near got his 
record.
