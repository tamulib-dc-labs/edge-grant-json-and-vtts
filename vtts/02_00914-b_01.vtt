WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:03.654
This is side number three.

00:07.477 --> 00:29.397
Picking up on the comments about the cooperation 
between Arizona and California on the interstate

00:07.477 --> 00:29.397
highway location, I think that was perhaps one of 
the highlights of the effort because there were

00:07.477 --> 00:29.397
some sharp differences of opinion about freeway 
location. as felt in the local community. These

00:33.754 --> 00:42.081
didn't seem to have to do too much with the often 
cited problems of accessibility to the freeway.

00:42.181 --> 00:47.285
It was more a matter of what property might be 
adversely affected and things of that sort. The

00:48.507 --> 01:00.497
other factor, though, that actually was a major 
factor on the California side in the location of

00:48.507 --> 01:00.497
the freeway was the fact that the lower Colorado 
River Indian Reservation, lay directly across

01:01.152 --> 01:04.716
the Colorado River from the city of Yuma. And it was 
necessary for the California Highway Department

01:05.978 --> 01:14.348
to go through part of the Indian Reservation with 
the interstate highway. There was also a town of

01:15.830 --> 01:29.927
sorts, a village, directly across to the north of 
downtown Yuma, which caused part of the problem,

01:15.830 --> 01:29.927
and there were some very sharp differences of 
opinion amongst the Indians as to whether or not,

01:30.312 --> 01:46.527
because of certain treaty situations, they 
should even allow a federal agency or a state

01:30.312 --> 01:46.527
agency to come in and preempt part of their land. 
And the feelings ran pretty high. In fact, so high

01:49.550 --> 01:58.378
that in a few years earlier, when one of the members 
of that tribe, while working for the post office in

01:58.797 --> 02:13.555
Yuma, had risen to the position of the assistant 
postmaster, the tribe disowned him because he was

01:58.797 --> 02:13.555
working for the federal government. And they saw 
the federal government as being an enemy, if you

02:13.575 --> 02:21.124
would, of the tribe. And so they would not have 
anything to do with him. He was literally shunned

02:23.928 --> 02:28.213
by the rest of the tribe because of the position. 
That was near the close of the time that I was in

02:29.122 --> 02:35.170
Yuma. I was there from,

02:35.190 --> 02:43.360
let's see, 1958 to 1962.

02:45.002 --> 02:57.998
One of the things, though, that was of extreme 
interest to me during 1959 and into 1960 was that I

02:45.002 --> 02:57.998
had a man by the name of William Wisner of the ISNER, 
who was from Michigan, had moved down. His wife was

03:04.570 --> 03:09.856
working for the county extension office as a home 
demonstration agent. And he was picked up on a

03:11.658 --> 03:25.875
release time by the city and county to direct the 
census operations in the southern part of Yuma

03:11.658 --> 03:25.875
County. The planning department became very much 
a part of the effort in making a lot of decisions

03:27.475 --> 03:40.795
about census enumeration in Yuma County as a 
result of that. And Whistler had lots to say. And

03:45.182 --> 03:54.175
his boss was in Phoenix, so it was really a very 
strong relationship that we had, including

03:54.391 --> 03:59.097
resolving some problems between the lower 
Colorado River Indians and the Kokopas. The

03:59.878 --> 04:17.342
Kokopas occupied a very small reservation of 
about 300 acres, located along

03:59.878 --> 04:17.342
the edge of the Yuma Mesa on the southwest part of 
Yuma. That, plus some experiences that Wisner had

04:17.983 --> 04:24.111
when he went up to work in northern Arizona on the 
Navajo reservation in dealing with the Indian

04:24.648 --> 04:45.680
tribes really gave me a much greater appreciation 
for some of the problems of the American Indian

04:24.648 --> 04:45.680
when the Indians themselves were both 
experiencing the need to move themselves as well

04:24.648 --> 04:45.680
as being confronted with urban expansion onto 
reservation lands. And of course, in Arizona, New

04:46.521 --> 04:51.769
Mexico, California, Nevada, this has become much 
more of a serious issue. In Oklahoma? Yeah. Well,

04:55.399 --> 04:59.164
in Oklahoma, except the reservations in Oklahoma 
are so few. But when you get to the Arizona, you have

04:59.184 --> 05:02.228
these tremendous. But the one in Tulsa is not. 
Right. That's right. So that was perhaps one of the

05:07.455 --> 05:11.100
other highlights. The third being that we were 
able to get airport zoning regulations adopted in

05:11.541 --> 05:19.512
Yuma County to protect the field there at Yuma, 
which was also jointly used initially by Army and

05:19.964 --> 05:30.760
then by Marine Corps as a Marine Corps auxiliary 
air station. What happened to the freeway debate

05:30.780 --> 05:35.147
between the two state agencies? Actually, the two 
state agencies were in very good agreement with

05:35.527 --> 05:40.575
each other. The problems were the conflicts 
between the general issue of federal government

05:40.956 --> 05:47.305
and and treaty lands that the Indians held, and the 
concerns that the local community had about

05:47.572 --> 05:57.060
access to and from the freeway. And the building of 
that route ultimately followed pretty much what

05:57.641 --> 06:10.873
the planning staff had concurred with with 
respect to the highway location. Did that go north

06:11.854 --> 06:14.136
of the territorial prison? It went. Well, OK, the 
territorial prison is at the northeast corner of

06:15.719 --> 06:20.748
downtown. And it went alongside the territorial 
prison just to the east of that, swept along the

06:21.289 --> 06:39.381
Mesa edge overlooking the Yuma Valley, 
overlooking the Gila Valley.

06:41.538 --> 06:44.141
to the east of the main part of Yuma. Really, Yuma 
sits kind of like a pointed. The north part is the

06:47.525 --> 06:55.355
point of a triangle, the south part being the 
bottom side of the triangle. And that's the

06:55.875 --> 06:57.297
southern end. And the town stretches off to the 
east. And the college site for the community

07:01.702 --> 07:11.494
college was located off to the east of downtown 
about four to five miles east along the edge of the

07:13.162 --> 07:21.110
Mesa and at an access point to the freeway. Then the 
freeway had to cross the Gila River on a bridge.

07:26.295 --> 07:36.684
Yes, well actually across the Colorado, the Gila 
already had spilled into the Gila, into the

07:26.295 --> 07:36.684
Colorado River.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.510
So those were perhaps the three principal things 
there. We did some work in northern part of Yuma

07:46.183 --> 08:12.970
County and Quartzsite and in Parker, but that area 
has since

07:46.183 --> 08:12.970
been separated off from about three quarters away 
north from Yuma up the Yuma Gunnery Range and Yuma

08:13.642 --> 08:25.718
Proving Grounds, which is the hot weather proving 
ground, Fort Churchill and Canada being the cold

08:13.642 --> 08:25.718
weather proving grounds for the Defense 
Department. And the northern part now is La Paz

08:25.738 --> 08:30.965
County. Fort Churchill is on Hudson Bay, isn't it? 
Yes, right. Where the polar bears are. Right. And

08:37.198 --> 08:44.025
so the men would get transferred and their 
families from Fort Churchill in the winter to Yuma

08:37.198 --> 08:44.025
in the summer. No. That's unfair. One extreme to 
the other. It would have been bad the other way, but

08:48.069 --> 08:52.754
they didn't see it that way. But during that time, 
we had good cooperation with the people at Yuma

08:52.834 --> 09:05.147
Proving Ground, which was basically 
Army-operated for the Defense Department. and

09:05.549 --> 09:18.565
with the Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station 
staff, did not have a lot of contact with them, but

09:05.549 --> 09:18.565
where there was an essential contact, I must say it 
was always very, very positive. I never had a

09:18.585 --> 09:22.210
negative experience with any of the military 
personnel. The same was true at Bergstrom Air

09:22.670 --> 09:26.575
Force Base in Austin. Never had a negative 
situation there.

09:31.681 --> 09:34.645
The other aspect of being in Yuma was that I also had 
a chance to help in getting a planning program.

09:43.257 --> 09:48.385
I guess you might say getting some blood put into 
the planning program in Nogales, Arizona. The

09:49.286 --> 09:50.748
planning director had been hired. He did not know 
much of what it was all about, and so he got steered

09:50.788 --> 10:03.788
to me, and I sat and worked with him for several days 
and then went and visited him in Nogales and tried

09:50.788 --> 10:03.788
to help him get things set up there. Nogales, 
Arizona is very small. Nogales, Sonora is fairly

10:05.694 --> 10:10.241
large by comparison. The Arizona side is 6,000 or 
8,000, maybe 10,000 people. The Sonora side was in

10:15.809 --> 10:21.658
the neighborhood of 60,000 to 80,000 people.

10:23.240 --> 10:28.869
And being a port of entry and all of that, it had its 
own problems, very unique to that area. But having

10:29.370 --> 10:31.733
worked in El Paso and having grown up in Tucson and 
having lived in Yuma, I had an appreciation of the

10:32.455 --> 10:40.743
border influences. And frankly, I always found 
that very enjoyable. The Hispanic culture I find

10:44.267 --> 10:48.932
very adaptable to my thoughts. When you were in 
Yuma then, you had contact with San Luis. Did not in

10:54.637 --> 10:56.659
official capacity. It was only to the extent that 
might have some contact with people who had

11:01.565 --> 11:04.067
business there or were going back and forth. 
That's all. Very little. Did have some contact

11:07.050 --> 11:11.254
with the planning staff in El Centro, California. 
El Centro was very, very small. And I think they had

11:13.696 --> 11:20.382
one planner on board and one draftsman or 
something like that. And that was it. And that was

11:22.084 --> 11:26.088
just minimal contact over there. Had some contact 
with planning staff in San Diego.

11:31.805 --> 11:35.849
That was a completely different ballgame. So 
really, we weren't talking the same thing. One

11:38.852 --> 11:39.773
interesting fact. At the time, in 1960 or 59, 
Arizona put in a requirement that all boats must be

11:40.614 --> 11:51.466
licensed. Statewide requirement, such as we have 
in Texas. time there were 49,000 people in total in

11:59.851 --> 12:15.130
Yuma County, the city and all the towns and all the 
unincorporated area. When the initial

12:15.150 --> 12:24.561
registration period was completed, there were 
over 10,000 votes registered in Yuma County. You

12:25.502 --> 12:26.624
would never believe it. Out in the desert. But it 
was the influence of the Colorado River. And in

12:33.282 --> 12:37.489
fact, a man lived down the street from us who was the 
commander. He was a reserve Coast Guard officer,

12:37.569 --> 12:58.461
and he was the commander of the Coast Guard Reserve 
Flotilla that literally patrolled the Colorado

12:37.569 --> 12:58.461
River from Yuma up to, well, about to Parker or 
Bullhead City. a distance of about 150 miles. Was

13:03.664 --> 13:07.889
there much recreation voting that went down to the 
Gulf of California? Not much going that way, no. It

13:10.091 --> 13:28.971
was, in fact, the major problems regionally, the 
major problems at that time centered on the

13:10.091 --> 13:28.971
conflict between the US and Mexico with respect to 
the question of water quality. for the discharge

13:29.879 --> 13:34.123
of water into the Colorado River. Arizona,

13:35.465 --> 13:59.430
Colorado, Utah were meeting the requirements in 
terms of quantity, but there was so much of a

13:35.465 --> 13:59.430
problem with the leaching of the ground that the 
salt content or the carbonate content was getting

13:35.465 --> 13:59.430
so high that in Mexico, below San Luis, there were 
farms that literally had been extremely

13:59.866 --> 14:10.360
productive that were being wiped out because of 
the high salt content in the water. And this was

14:11.442 --> 14:19.893
becoming a very, very sore point for Mexico in its 
relations with the US. And that, in turn, prompted

14:20.454 --> 14:28.945
some actions on the part of the

14:29.887 --> 14:45.427
authorities at Boulder Dam and Hoover Dam and at 
the other dams on the Gila River to release larger

14:29.887 --> 14:45.427
quantities of water to thin out the salt content 
going downstream. Plus began, that was the

14:46.769 --> 14:59.826
beginning perhaps of some real effort on the part 
of the farming community in both the Gila Valley

14:46.769 --> 14:59.826
and the Yuma Valley to find some better ways to 
utilize the water that they were taking from the

15:00.278 --> 15:07.689
river and from underground. A lot of water was 
coming from underground sources.

15:14.058 --> 15:21.208
The other remaining highlight of the experience 
in Yuma, though, was in the Welton Mohawk Valley.

15:22.069 --> 15:27.096
There were a number of farmers that were very much 
concerned with planting. They believed in it.

15:35.373 --> 15:39.760
They supported it through conservation 
districts. In fact, many of them lived in Yuma,

15:39.780 --> 15:53.601
even though they owned places out in the Welton 
Mohawk, 60 to 80 miles away from town, and would

15:39.780 --> 15:53.601
commute daily out there to do their farming. Of 
course, there were people who lived in the town of

15:55.263 --> 15:58.348
Welton a relatively small number. Terrible 
drinking water. And how people put up with it, I

16:05.776 --> 16:07.819
don't know. But anyway, they lived there. Some of 
them did. And I went out a couple of times and met

16:11.064 --> 16:21.499
with the people there, as I did with the farm 
community and some of the mining people. And when I

16:21.559 --> 16:29.230
say mining people, I'm talking about hard rock 
miners that came out of the hills up in the

16:21.559 --> 16:29.230
Quartzside area in the northeastern part of Yuma 
County. And those folks believed in planning.

16:37.983 --> 16:55.042
They were rugged individuals, but they saw the 
need to get together on major issues such as water

16:37.983 --> 16:55.042
conservation, water usage, depletion of soil, 
highway location issues, things of that sort. And

16:55.823 --> 16:57.124
so they were very positive. And I always could look 
to them if I had a real problem out in that area to get

16:58.454 --> 17:12.153
some good, solid, and very realistic answers to 
the issues, the problems that were at hand. So I

17:12.173 --> 17:15.658
count that experience as being a very positive 
one. Then in 1962, I left Yuma, went to the city of

17:15.678 --> 17:26.993
Phoenix as assistant planning director under 
John Beatty, who was planning director, chief of

17:15.678 --> 17:26.993
our advanced planning section, was Gordon 
Wagner, who then moved to Florida. I don't

17:34.252 --> 17:35.473
remember which city. This was several years after 
I had left there. And I was in Phoenix from 1962 to

17:41.720 --> 17:45.364
1964. Others

17:45.704 --> 17:57.537
of the key staff that I dealt with were Jim Talley in 
the subdivision area,

17:58.664 --> 18:07.772
who was very astute and a good

17:58.664 --> 18:07.772
operator. Jim Talley, who was in zoning and 
especially on special use permits and things of

18:08.232 --> 18:18.762
that sort, very good. Bob Johnson, who was 
responsible for the subdivision planning

18:19.302 --> 18:28.350
process, and again conducted an operation which I 
was able to contribute a little to in much the same

18:29.528 --> 18:34.295
way that we had managed to do in Austin. So there was 
some bridging across between the experience in

18:34.916 --> 18:45.253
Austin and what we were able to do in practice in 
Phoenix. One of the things that occurred,

18:45.273 --> 18:54.507
which was rather interesting, was that through 
the zoning operation, and we had zoning hearings

18:54.841 --> 19:11.202
every week, either commission hearings or 
council hearings, with usually somewhere in the

18:54.841 --> 19:11.202
neighborhood of 15 to 25 cases a week, which was a 
terrible load. One of the things we were able to do

19:13.205 --> 19:23.498
was to regularize some of the hearing process John 
Beatty and I worked on this. And through the

19:27.124 --> 19:41.817
assistance of people like Bob Johnson and Jim 
Talley, we were able to bridge over some of these

19:27.124 --> 19:41.817
special use permit problems which went to the 
Board of Adjustment and the zoning issues. And

19:43.459 --> 19:52.287
one area of practice that I first saw in Phoenix was 
the idea of placing signs on the property and near

19:53.144 --> 20:11.571
the property under either zoning change 
consideration or board of adjustment

19:53.144 --> 20:11.571
consideration on a variance or special 
exception. Signs about 18 by 24 inches or a little

20:13.834 --> 20:17.259
larger. And these signs were color coded. I recall 
blue for Board of Adjustment, pink for zoning, and

20:22.642 --> 20:41.760
later on I brought that idea to Fort Worth and it has 
since spread elsewhere in the state of Texas as a

20:22.642 --> 20:41.760
very practical way of letting the public know what 
was going on because legal ads generally don't

20:22.642 --> 20:41.760
take care of the real need. There were also some 
things we did there in the notices including the

20:43.662 --> 20:52.530
sending of frequently a map along on the zoning 
notice to people so they could physically see what

20:53.455 --> 21:05.047
the property was as it was going to be considered.

21:10.232 --> 21:22.905
Gordon Wagner in the advanced planning section 
was in a dual role, not only responsible for that

21:10.232 --> 21:22.905
operation in the city's domain, but also worked 
with two fellows, Gary Bourne, who was on loan from

21:23.628 --> 21:52.605
the Public Works Department, and another 
individual whose name I cannot, first name I can't

21:23.628 --> 21:52.605
recall, his name was Johnson, on loan from Traffic 
Engineering, and the three of them formed, were

21:23.628 --> 21:52.605
formed into what was called the Transportation 
Planning Team under the direction of Ed Hall, who

21:23.628 --> 21:52.605
at one time had been Traffic Engineer for the city 
and or county of San Diego. And Ed had come over for

21:58.235 --> 22:15.158
the purpose of trying to help determine the 
policies that should be established in the plan

21:58.235 --> 22:15.158
for transportation in Phoenix, and by greater 
implication, Maricopa County. And from what I've

22:15.178 --> 22:19.504
seen in Phoenix, they could use a lot of 
transportation. Right. And that has been one of

22:20.371 --> 22:31.124
the problems, because the proposals that they 
came up with consistently got rejected by the

22:20.371 --> 22:31.124
politicos. The Papago Freeway was one that they 
worked on very hard, did lots of documentation on,

22:31.184 --> 22:44.119
and it fell virtually on deaf ears. Council 
members supported it, but the public did not. And

22:49.690 --> 22:57.300
council members were never able to convince the 
citizens at large that this was a good thing to do.

22:58.522 --> 23:12.061
And when it would get into the question of location 
and design and so on, and they'd have local area

22:58.522 --> 23:12.061
hearings, which occurred after I left, 
neighborhoods would rise up in opposition. We

23:12.081 --> 23:14.584
want a freeway, but not next to our neighborhood. 
And so many of the ideas that were developed just

23:16.285 --> 23:25.275
went by the boards, I'm sad to say. However, what I 
did see there was something that I think every city

23:25.415 --> 23:41.652
ought to do, and that is to set aside a group of 
people with the full backing of top management, as

23:42.880 --> 23:49.128
a coordinating body in the field of 
transportation planning. They were able to do

23:49.148 --> 23:50.570
things. And even though your comment is well 
taken, Phoenix needs a lot to be done. But what you

23:57.738 --> 24:07.711
see today on the ground, what has been 
accomplished, in part has been accomplished

23:57.738 --> 24:07.711
because of the Arizona State Highway Department. 
But in large measure, even these rather

24:11.973 --> 24:18.844
mechanistic kinds of changes that have been made 
were accomplished simply because of that

24:11.973 --> 24:18.844
transportation planning team. It was the first 
time that you really got three departments with

24:18.864 --> 24:38.875
key personnel working together, battling out 
ideas, hashing out this, hashing out that,

24:18.864 --> 24:38.875
deciding these are the hardcore issues, here are 
decent alternatives, presenting those to their

24:39.698 --> 24:46.969
department heads, and those department heads, in 
turn, presenting them to the city manager and the

24:39.698 --> 24:46.969
city council.

24:48.631 --> 25:03.212
It meant a lot of study, a lot of investigation, a 
lot of time by people who had the intellectual

24:48.631 --> 25:03.212
background, the knowledge base to deal with the 
things. But what was lacking was somebody, and I

25:03.232 --> 25:09.081
think this is often a fault in city in the council 
manager plan of government, somebody who was in

25:09.837 --> 25:18.569
the role of the community relations expert. They 
had the technical know-how, and they had the

25:20.311 --> 25:27.922
community needs assessment know-how. They just 
didn't have anybody to go out and explain to the

25:27.942 --> 25:36.493
public at large, here's why you need to do all these 
things. Yes, it is going to hurt this area. But

25:38.626 --> 25:41.830
here's the benefit for the total city. Yeah, they 
need someone to point out the consequences of the

25:41.850 --> 25:47.416
various alternatives. And if we do this, then this 
is going to happen. And this will be good, and this

25:51.681 --> 25:53.623
will be not so good. But I think this is the one thing 
that I saw as a function of city government, which

25:55.265 --> 26:05.897
frankly, I was very pleased with. I would say the 
one thing. Disappointment, though, was that Ed

26:08.663 --> 26:34.789
Hall, as the coordinator or the person in charge of 
the team, and he had other responsibilities too,

26:08.663 --> 26:34.789
but as the coordinator of that team, he had a rather 
brusque manner, a know-it-all manner that

26:08.663 --> 26:34.789
projected to the public that they weren't going to 
be listened to. And that was too bad because Ed was

26:36.946 --> 26:44.717
really relying on those fellows who had lived 
there. They knew the community. They knew the

26:46.039 --> 26:47.000
problems. They were good technicians. They were 
very professional. Two of them were registered

26:52.328 --> 26:54.571
professional engineers. Gordon had been at it for 
five, six, seven years. He was a Harvard planning

26:59.698 --> 27:05.085
program graduate. Every reason. in the world to 
think that things could have come out right. In

27:10.366 --> 27:16.993
fact, I think he had spent some time in Minneapolis 
also on the planning staff, as I recall. I'm not

27:17.073 --> 27:18.595
sure of that.

27:21.378 --> 27:24.461
That's a tough agency to get into. Up there? Yes. 
Once you're in that agency, no one leaves. Well, he

27:29.967 --> 27:32.049
had left for health reasons. Literally, he and his 
wife both had health problems and so on. moved to

27:36.329 --> 27:37.050
Phoenix. But I was in Phoenix two years, and 
frankly I left because the opportunity arrived to

27:38.412 --> 28:02.910
work under a city manager that had been in 
Cookingham's backyard, as it were, trained under

27:38.412 --> 28:02.910
LP Cookingham in Kansas City.

28:04.291 --> 28:11.401
That was the primary reason I departed in 64 to move 
to Fort Worth. I can't say really with respect to

28:13.925 --> 28:32.070
the Phoenix experience that there was much else 
other than my involvement in trying to regularize

28:13.925 --> 28:32.070
some of the subdivision planning process and to 
help a couple of community interests One, I did sit

28:32.843 --> 28:46.598
as the planning director's representative to the 
high-rise study committee, which included a

28:32.843 --> 28:46.598
number of people who were interested in the 
development of high-rise buildings. In fact, the

28:47.840 --> 29:01.635
chairman of the committee was a man from Colwell 
Banker who had moved over from Los Angeles just six

28:47.840 --> 29:01.635
months before he became chairman of that 
committee, a very astute person.

29:03.083 --> 29:10.614
In fact, he one time described Phoenix like a 
Hollywood set, all false fronts.

29:14.459 --> 29:20.848
For somebody coming from Los Angeles and 
Hollywood, I thought that was a very

29:14.459 --> 29:20.848
understandable statement. But I guess the only 
other experience that I had there that I can really

29:22.110 --> 29:31.403
look to as being a particularly profitable one was 
in working with, again, Parks and Recreation

29:32.007 --> 29:46.164
Department on some of their rather detailed 
problems, on-site location problems.

29:47.606 --> 29:54.134
Was there any concern over air pollution at that 
time? Not in Phoenix at that time, no. The concerns

29:59.220 --> 30:01.002
were more water Phoenix, in fact, experienced 
flooding there on the river,

30:02.737 --> 30:21.517
pretty extensive flooding, in fact, between Sky 
Harbor Airport and downtown, although downtown

30:02.737 --> 30:21.517
is not really at the river. But there were those 
problems, and we also had some needs for

30:22.238 --> 30:32.389
coordination with the county in the work that was 
being done out in the suburban areas.

30:42.356 --> 30:48.441
That was fair to Midland cooperation. There was 
always some conflict, though, beneath the

30:48.461 --> 30:56.168
surface between John Beatty and the county 
planning director. Both of them were pretty

30:56.208 --> 31:00.452
long-term entrenched in their positions. the 
county planning director's name i can't think of

31:02.727 --> 31:32.262
right now don well anyway whatever uh but i knew 
that john baity was going to be around for a good

31:02.727 --> 31:32.262
long time so i decided it was better to just depart 
although he when i left we were on extremely good

31:02.727 --> 31:32.262
terms and he encouraged me to stay so i i could have 
stayed there indefinitely but i wanted a chance to

31:02.727 --> 31:32.262
work in a in a little different management 
situation in fact the manager in phoenix at that

31:32.815 --> 31:42.083
time was the brother of the man
