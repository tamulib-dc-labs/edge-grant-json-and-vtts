WEBVTT

00:04.402 --> 00:05.463
We're back in business. Okay. So we were talking 
about just your general view on war prior to the

00:09.007 --> 00:13.572
war. Okay. After I got into it and saw what it was, I 
guess as far as killing, it came more of second

00:14.152 --> 00:26.525
nature to me. I just did it, and I didn't think about 
it. After basically, you know, you're sitting

00:34.810 --> 00:49.528
there watching the guy beside you get blown away 
or, you know, there's bombs hitting all around

00:34.810 --> 00:49.528
your mortars or whatever, you're sitting there 
shooting or you're keeping your head down or

00:34.810 --> 00:49.528
whatever just to stay alive. So you're fighting 
for your own life. And you really don't think about

00:52.611 --> 00:58.999
what you're fighting for other than your own 
personal salvation to stay alive. You... Get very

01:02.013 --> 01:04.917
close to God if you're a religious person. You pray 
a lot. You know, you promise everybody in the world

01:07.961 --> 01:13.849
everything if you can come out of it alive type 
thing. Yeah, you get in a situation like that, it's

01:14.250 --> 01:19.877
hard to really express your feelings until you've 
gotten there. But once you're there and you're in

01:20.518 --> 01:27.528
it, you know, you really wake up to really what the 
world's all about. And you appreciate God. things

01:29.300 --> 01:59.053
in life that you probably would have never even 
thought were there or realized like running water

01:29.300 --> 01:59.053
or flush toilets or whatever you want to say I mean 
you know that sort of thing but the war part of it as

01:29.300 --> 01:59.053
far as killing I feel you know they taught me how to 
kill that was one thing I learned and to me it's

01:29.300 --> 01:59.053
second nature not that I'm going to go out and kill 
anybody tomorrow or nothing but I could probably

01:29.300 --> 01:59.053
see somebody killed and or kill somebody and I 
wouldn't think twice about it. I'm very numb to

02:02.912 --> 02:04.053
that. I have no feelings that way. I'm very numb. 
And I had to blame the Vietnam War on that. If I was

02:11.663 --> 02:17.370
called upon to go fight again, which I probably 
never will be, I probably would do it without even

02:11.663 --> 02:17.370
thinking. You know, not that I'm quote 100% 
patriot or anything like that, but it's just that

02:18.852 --> 02:25.100
maybe that's in me. I don't know. It's been 
described by... Well, like, for example, Philip

02:29.577 --> 02:49.630
Caputo with the First Marines, he said even though 
he was an anti-war protester, after he got out of

02:29.577 --> 02:49.630
Vietnam, he said there was still that attraction 
in him about Vietnam, and he could not deny that for

02:29.577 --> 02:49.630
what it was worth. There was something about the 
camaraderie that none of us who have never been to

02:50.211 --> 02:56.040
war could ever realize. You try to explain it to 
your family or wife or friends or anybody,

02:56.510 --> 03:04.783
especially if a relative dies or something. I have 
had several close relatives die and friends, and I

03:05.083 --> 03:11.172
show no emotion to it. Do you feel any emotion? I 
really don't.

03:17.241 --> 03:18.423
Maybe someday it will hit me. I don't know. But at 
this stage of the game, since I've been back, I've

03:19.024 --> 03:22.990
been very numb to death. And, you know, I have been 
in incidents where, with my job especially here,

03:23.510 --> 03:34.061
these guys got killed in that car accident, and I 
found them in the water dead. And, you know, I

03:35.122 --> 03:45.953
personally found them and, you know, helped pull 
them out of the water and everything, and it didn't

03:35.122 --> 03:45.953
affect me at all, although there was people all 
around just screaming and crying and yelling and

03:35.122 --> 03:45.953
everything because these guys were dead. But to 
me, it didn't affect me whatsoever. I'd seen so

03:48.795 --> 03:51.458
much death and blood that it didn't bother me. And 
so, in a way, I guess that is what war means to me. You

03:57.969 --> 04:00.772
know, I have no feelings. I'm very numb. Do you? 
Exactly. Any more? Do you feel like you have any

04:03.917 --> 04:06.040
illusions? No, no. I had, initially, when I came 
back, it was really tough. I was very jumpy and, you

04:11.267 --> 04:17.976
know, people couldn't come near me while I was 
sleeping. I've slept very, very lightly. I had a

04:20.530 --> 04:24.395
real hard time adjusting initially the first year 
or so. I was back, it was tough, and I was very

04:24.455 --> 04:27.619
violent.

04:31.524 --> 04:37.110
Basically, I would, you know, if somebody upset 
me, I would just go into a rage sometimes. And

04:37.791 --> 04:41.916
you've probably experienced that when you were 
working with me. I, since, I guess the last two

04:42.898 --> 04:47.183
years, have really mellowed out from that 
standpoint. But it took me quite a few years to

04:47.203 --> 04:50.487
really get over that. Do loud noises make you 
jumpy? Very jumpy, yes. Even to this day, if I hear a

04:55.470 --> 04:59.454
gunshot, my first reaction is to get down. I mean, 
very, very quick. It's ingrained in you, isn't it?

05:02.617 --> 05:02.737
Yes. And I initially did not hunt for several years 
after I got back, but I did get back into hunting

05:03.358 --> 05:16.011
again in the woods and shooting again, deer 
hunting, duck hunting, whatever that way. And I

05:16.752 --> 05:20.676
found it very, very second nature. to go back out 
into the woods again and hunt. And I was able,

05:23.801 --> 05:30.972
actually I've shot more deer probably since then 
because maybe of my training in the war, you know,

05:23.801 --> 05:30.972
that way. It's just nothing to go out and pop a deer 
and, you know, be able to see it and hit it and know

05:32.214 --> 05:40.327
what's there, you know, that sort of thing. See 
through the camouflage. See through what's

05:41.048 --> 05:42.490
there, exactly. Do you catch yourself looking for 
tripwires whenever you go to the jungle? Well, I

05:45.695 --> 05:48.840
look for anything. And not necessarily 
tripwires, but there's things that I'll be

05:49.394 --> 05:57.004
walking along and I sit there and say, stop, or 
something. There's a guy with me. What the hell are

05:58.125 --> 05:59.066
you doing? And I said, see that over there? There's 
an animal in there or something. And you can just

06:03.953 --> 06:05.995
see things. And the guy says, what are you talking 
about? And I said, right there. See that? Yeah, you

06:10.049 --> 06:17.158
see different footprints, and you can tell, 
especially where the deer, when you're deer

06:10.049 --> 06:17.158
hunting, I guess it's more prevalent than 
anything else. You can see where they've been and

06:17.178 --> 06:21.604
track them and follow them and see where the 
animals were. But the actual sense that's there, I

06:21.664 --> 06:31.516
don't know what you call it, seven cents there 
again, but I really have got that still. I think in

06:31.596 --> 06:38.505
the woods I could be very, very pleased to go back 
out in the jungle and live if I had to. Thanks.

06:40.272 --> 06:41.354
That's pretty interesting. You're not the only 
one that's stated that. While we're on the subject

06:45.180 --> 06:49.647
of your homecoming, what was your homecoming 
like? Did the military ship you back and then just

06:49.767 --> 06:55.977
dump you in Houston, Texas and say you're home? Was 
there any adjustment period? No, there was no

06:59.182 --> 07:00.604
adjustment period. I had a very unique 
homecoming. My unit did stand down the 101st. I'm

07:05.532 --> 07:07.275
sorry, not the 101st, the 1st Cav. The 101st stood 
down, too, but I came home with the first cab. It was

07:10.766 --> 07:14.731
the second of the fifth, which basically was just 
our particular unit. So you did come back with the

07:14.751 --> 07:15.552
unit? Well, not actually. I came home, and they 
stood down two weeks later. So I flew back from

07:23.140 --> 07:33.972
Vietnam to Travis Air Force Base, went through 
debriefing at Travis Air Force Base, stayed there

07:23.140 --> 07:33.972
for almost two weeks. And they basically every day 
would question me and debrief me and check me and

07:34.610 --> 07:49.265
test my urine and all this sort of thing, make sure I 
was drug free and that I wasn't a sicko and I wasn't

07:34.610 --> 07:49.265
going to go blow people away and all this sort of 
thing. So there was about a two-week debriefing

07:49.285 --> 07:53.809
period where I could not see anyone or talk to 
anyone. I couldn't even call my family. And I was in

07:56.232 --> 08:02.558
the States, but I couldn't call or talk to them for 
two weeks.

08:02.892 --> 08:07.417
you know, was kind of getting back familiar with 
the world, they called it. I came back to the world.

08:09.439 --> 08:16.747
And I was still in the military at the time, and I 
supposedly had two more months to go before I was

08:09.439 --> 08:16.747
out. So what they decided to do with me would be to go 
ahead and give me an early out so I didn't have to do

08:17.468 --> 08:25.617
any service because I wasn't going to re-up. And 
they tried their best in that two-week period to

08:26.598 --> 08:31.323
get me to sign up for more time, but I didn't do it. 
And... So they went ahead and gave me an early out at

08:33.065 --> 08:38.733
that time, and the unit stood down at Fort Hood, 
Texas. So I came home to Pasadena, and when the unit

08:39.955 --> 09:00.523
came home to Fort Hood, I went back up to Fort Hood, 
and they actually had a major ceremony with the

08:39.955 --> 09:00.523
band and the whole nine yards for the colonels and 
the captains and everybody, and they went through

08:39.955 --> 09:00.523
the whole deal and had a big cake and party on the 
lawn. for the unit standing down and coming home

09:00.892 --> 09:03.755
from Vietnam. And the colonels and everybody that 
I'd worked with was there. So it was pretty

09:08.541 --> 09:14.567
emotional because they all left like two weeks 
after I did and came home. So I came home basically,

09:15.088 --> 09:20.094
got my wife and immediately drove to Fort Hood, 
Texas and met them there. And so I got to see the guys

09:20.114 --> 09:23.197
and everybody I was with and everything. And the 
majority of them were still in the service and

09:23.577 --> 09:27.642
stationed at Fort Hood at that time. Did y'all 
party like hell that night? Yeah, we had a pretty

09:30.830 --> 09:31.911
good time. We really enjoyed it. Actually, I was 
with my wife again at the same time with the guys I'd

09:33.373 --> 09:38.239
been with for six months, too. It was getting to 
know the stateside plus my wife, that sort of

09:39.400 --> 09:44.767
thing. It was pretty emotional all the way around. 
They got to meet her. Of course, you always talk

09:50.353 --> 09:54.619
about your family and stuff with your buddies, 
that sort of thing. Then we went back home and I

09:58.790 --> 10:02.073
tried not to go back to work, but I couldn't stay 
around the house. I had to go and do, so I went back to

10:02.193 --> 10:05.896
work pretty quick. Was it easy to find a job? Well, I 
already had the job. I was very fortunate there.

10:10.800 --> 10:27.835
When I left and was drafted, I was working for 
Exxon, and Exxon basically paid my wife

10:10.800 --> 10:27.835
dependency pay the whole time I was in NOM, and so 
when I came back, I was guaranteed a job, so I walked

10:10.800 --> 10:27.835
right back into the job at Exxon, and I basically 
got my seniority back. My job was right there

10:31.838 --> 10:37.184
waiting for me and everything, so it was no problem 
to walk right back into a job at all. It was hard to

10:38.045 --> 10:42.350
get used to the routine again, but I was able to go 
back into it. Did you ever receive any abuse for

10:42.630 --> 10:46.595
being a back? No abuse, but I did expect to be... 
Down upon maybe? No, not really. I expected to be

10:53.943 --> 10:56.826
treated more as a hero. because I came back alive 
and well, but I was never really treated one way or

10:57.818 --> 11:04.606
the other. It was no, it was like, oh, you went to 
NAMM? Big deal, you know. And I said, Jesus, I went

11:09.712 --> 11:14.859
over there and fought for the country and almost 
died and, you know, all this, all that. I come back

11:14.879 --> 11:16.721
and it's no big deal, you know. And, you know, 
that's really the way it was. I got no special

11:21.627 --> 11:25.952
treatment, no preference treatment, you know, No 
real thank you or nothing, you know, from anybody.

11:31.436 --> 11:37.082
And, of course, my military benefits as far as my 
schooling and housing and stuff like that were all

11:31.436 --> 11:37.082
there, my VA benefits. But that's really the only 
thing that really came out of the whole deal, you

11:37.102 --> 11:42.947
know, after the fact, so to speak. Do you think if 
you didn't have this, I don't mean to use the word

11:42.967 --> 11:55.898
party, but this party, so to say, this 
get-together with the First Cap back at Fort Hood.

11:56.339 --> 11:56.479
Mm-hmm. Do you think if you didn't at least have 
that bit of a welcome back committee, do you think

11:57.050 --> 12:05.827
it would have been a hell of a lot worse for you 
personally? Probably so. Emotionally? Probably

12:07.350 --> 12:08.031
so. And, you know, of course, my family treated me 
like I was a hero. I mean, that was, I can say, but no

12:12.500 --> 12:17.129
one outside my family ever did. And... You know, 
I'm sure all the veterans feel the same way. This is

12:22.343 --> 12:25.027
pretty much a standard deal across the board. They 
got just slided by everybody. And, you know, just

12:30.956 --> 12:35.984
until the recent time, you know, the veterans 
hadn't even hardly been acknowledged to be in

12:30.956 --> 12:35.984
there. And, you know, just in the recent, you know, 
years, past few years, if, you know, anybody, you

12:37.386 --> 12:46.260
know, the Congress or, you know, the President or 
anybody really acknowledged that, There was a

12:46.578 --> 12:50.884
war, or there was veterans, or people did die, you 
know, this sort of thing. So that, I think, if

12:50.944 --> 13:00.456
anything, is very, very hard to swallow because 
thousands and thousands of guys and girls lost

12:50.944 --> 13:00.456
their lives in Nam. And, you know, it's something 
that should be remembered and, you know,

13:00.516 --> 13:09.548
respected for those that did fight and did come 
back and did die. And, you know, just until here

13:10.370 --> 13:12.973
recently, that hasn't happened. What do you think 
about when you got back? Were there any anti-war

13:15.594 --> 13:18.038
protests? No, I didn't see anything like that. 
That really never bothered me. I saw a lot of it

13:20.581 --> 13:22.863
before I went. What about afterwards? 
Afterwards, never really saw anything that much

13:24.566 --> 13:28.210
directly at all. I saw a lot of it on TV. What did you 
think about it when you saw it on TV? It didn't

13:33.136 --> 13:36.460
really bother me because I had a choice to make, 
too. I could have tried to dodge a draft. I could

13:39.204 --> 13:40.425
have gone to Canada. I could have. When AWOL, I had 
choices too. I could have stayed in school and not

13:43.367 --> 13:45.229
got drafted. I mean, you know, it's a situation. I 
guess I chose my own destiny in a way. Going back to

13:51.034 --> 13:58.922
my basic training, my AIT, the guys that came out of 
AIT, there was only about six of us that ended up

13:51.034 --> 13:58.922
going to NAM out of about 50 of us. Everybody else 
went to Germany. So, you know, it's a weird

14:01.384 --> 14:04.767
situation. There's still two or three guys that I 
went in with that were local here in the Houston

14:04.787 --> 14:08.931
area. One guy lives in Alvin. I see him every once in 
a while. He went to Germany for the whole two-year

14:11.950 --> 14:14.933
stint. He had a house in Germany where he was living 
off base. He had a blast over there. He bought some

14:20.959 --> 14:24.141
German cars and Mercedes and stuff like that. The 
guy had a blast while he was there. Here I was in

14:26.624 --> 14:28.345
Vietnam getting shot at. I felt that I accepted 
what they gave me and I did it the way I wanted to do

14:30.307 --> 14:36.773
it. I had a choice. And I chose it and did the best I 
could with it. So the protest and stuff and the

14:41.044 --> 14:47.552
anti-war stuff, you know, that's an individual 
type thing. I have no problem with that at all. I've

14:49.655 --> 14:56.343
heard this from some veterans, one particular, 
the helicopter pilot that I talked to you earlier

14:49.655 --> 14:56.343
about. What he stated when he got back, one, he had 
no readjustment period whatsoever. Right.

15:03.856 --> 15:06.318
Personally, this can be two-part. The first 
question, do you think the military should give a

15:06.338 --> 15:13.145
readjustment period to vets with what you've 
experienced? Yes, definitely. And then the other

15:17.469 --> 15:25.537
thing he said, he too expressed that he had 
absolutely zero problems with the anti-war

15:17.469 --> 15:25.537
protesters. The people that he had a problem with 
were those who did not acknowledge Vietnam. Who

15:32.020 --> 15:33.041
didn't even care. Exactly. That's basically what 
I was saying. What hurt me and upset me more were the

15:35.703 --> 15:40.948
people that didn't even care, you know. And there 
was a lot of them. And they just seemed to have no

15:43.551 --> 15:46.834
feelings one way or another. You say, hey, I went to 
Nam, you know, and they say, oh, really? Big deal.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.179
You know, I would rather a guy say, oh, man, that was 
terrible. You shouldn't have gone or, you know,

15:53.219 --> 16:00.306
Vietnam was a waste of time or a baby killer or 
anything, you know, that sort of thing, rather

15:53.219 --> 16:00.306
than say, I don't care. you know, at least the 
protesters had a voice, they had an opinion, you

16:00.961 --> 16:27.171
know, they used it, you know, so, you know, from 
that standpoint, the ones that I agree 100% with

16:00.961 --> 16:27.171
what the, you know, the pilot said, you know, the 
ones that didn't acknowledge it at all, to me, are

16:00.961 --> 16:27.171
the worst, you know, because it was a situation 
where, granted, they weren't, our country wasn't

16:00.961 --> 16:27.171
on the line, you know, they weren't invading 
America or United States or anything like that,

16:00.961 --> 16:27.171
but American lives and money was being lost and 
thrown away basically on a daily basis You know and

16:27.370 --> 16:54.357
that affects everybody You will for many many many 
years I

16:27.370 --> 16:54.357
want to get back to Vietnam and with the units the 
one last question that I had I was sort of

16:27.370 --> 16:54.357
sidetracked from but I wanted you to elaborate a 
little bit more on the racism and Was it mainly

16:55.636 --> 17:01.345
whites versus black or blacks versus everybody? 
It was pretty much the blacks did their own thing.

17:05.190 --> 17:13.242
And they really, I would say, you know, probably 
I'd say 80% of the soldiers were black. Okay. And so

17:15.526 --> 17:21.795
leaders were mostly sergeants were black. Very 
few officers were black because you had to be

17:22.113 --> 17:27.901
educated to be an officer. And not that blacks are 
not educated by any means. The majority of them

17:31.807 --> 17:35.392
just were not college people. And the college 
blacks were smart enough not to get drafted or go in

17:35.873 --> 17:40.720
the Army. So, you know, if they were smart enough to 
be smart, they didn't go in the service. So very few

17:44.626 --> 17:48.171
blacks were actually officers. so you had a direct 
conflict of race right there and the blacks had

17:48.590 --> 18:15.897
their own clicks and their own things and you know 
they get together and you know you tell them to go

17:48.590 --> 18:15.897
out on a mission or something and they just look at 
you and say you know where you can jump you know that

17:48.590 --> 18:15.897
sort of thing and just say i'm not going to do it and 
you know and here's a lieutenant cherry

17:48.590 --> 18:15.897
lieutenant trying to tell this black guy that 
stands three foot tall on him to go out and run this

17:48.590 --> 18:15.897
ambush you know and It just didn't happen, so there 
was a lot of that. And, I mean, you really would be

18:19.471 --> 18:22.755
fear of them. I mean, you would fear your life from 
your fellow soldier, you know, buddy. And if you

18:28.562 --> 18:34.189
didn't get in good with them, you know, you never 
knew whether they were going to shoot you in the

18:28.562 --> 18:34.189
back or frag you or what. And, I mean, we'd get in a 
firefight, and, you know, if you pissed one of them

18:35.431 --> 18:45.023
off, I mean, you better be looking over your 
shoulder to make sure he wasn't behind you because

18:35.431 --> 18:45.023
you might get shot. And it did happen. I mean, you 
know, guys would get shot all the time in a

18:46.412 --> 18:49.375
firefight, you know. And it was the racism. It was 
more racism than anything else. You know, if you

18:52.758 --> 19:05.591
didn't work with them, you know, if you were 
anti-black or anti-Hispanic or had any views or

18:52.758 --> 19:05.591
opinions about their racism, you know, generally 
you wouldn't last. You had to go with the flow and,

19:06.552 --> 19:11.957
you know, be one of the guys and this sort of thing. 
And there again... The longer you were around

19:13.522 --> 19:21.630
them, the longer you were in country, the better 
you had a chance of living, not only from your

19:13.522 --> 19:21.630
people, but from the other ones too, you know. And 
the blacks were the most prominent. Of course, the

19:25.134 --> 19:28.117
Hispanic people had that type of thing. And there 
was, I guess there was a few of the actual

19:28.197 --> 19:40.250
Vietnamese or chinks or whatever you want to call 
them that were there in the service too with us that

19:28.197 --> 19:40.250
worked with us. We called them, what did we call 
those guys? I can't even remember the name of them,

19:45.702 --> 19:52.831
but they were like the Vietnamese scouts guys that 
worked with us, you know, local villager type

19:45.702 --> 19:52.831
thing. But they were actually Army. I mean, I don't 
know how they, you know, they weren't Arvin. They

19:58.980 --> 20:00.001
were our guys. They were basically employed by the 
U.S. government as scouts, kind of like Kit Carson

20:00.041 --> 20:07.511
and Tonto or whatever, you know, that way. So, you 
know, from that standpoint. But, you know, we

20:09.834 --> 20:11.997
would. And some of the times we'd go out, we'd 
actually have, they called them Kit Carson

20:12.382 --> 20:17.266
Scouts. That was the name. They called them Kit 
Carson Scouts. They would go out with us and work

20:20.009 --> 20:22.251
with us and stuff like that. But the blacks were the 
biggest racial thing. And they had their cliques

20:25.373 --> 20:27.495
and their things. And, you know, they had their 
prostitute rings they ran. They had black market

20:30.177 --> 20:35.522
food and drugs and liquor. You know, liquor was 
very prominent. And, you know, you get it for

20:38.304 --> 20:40.346
almost nothing. But, I mean, yeah. We, I remember 
one time, we wanted some beer in the field. I'll

20:46.377 --> 20:47.198
never forget this. We were in the middle of 
nowhere. I mean, there was no fire bases around,

20:49.041 --> 20:50.983
nothing. And we had this one black sergeant that 
was, he was really a cool guy. And he called back in

20:55.449 --> 20:58.934
and he says, my men need some beer. And the supply 
sergeant at the fire base says, you know, they got

21:00.336 --> 21:05.583
on the radio and back and forth, back and forth. And 
it wasn't two hours later, here comes a chopper

21:06.084 --> 21:10.350
with a pallet full of beer. I mean, it was a whole 
pallet of cases of beer. And we had a whole company

21:16.483 --> 21:19.507
of guys out there, so there was quite a few guys. And 
they set this pallet of hot beer down, and they set

21:20.028 --> 21:24.074
it down and left. I mean, they didn't hang around at 
all. And we all went out there and packed up as much

21:26.357 --> 21:32.305
beer as we could possibly put on our bodies and 
carried it with us. So we had beer out there, and the

21:32.622 --> 21:35.305
jungle was black labeled, too. I'll never forget 
it. It's the worst tasting beer, but it was beer.

21:38.468 --> 21:43.834
And we would take it in the mountains, and the 
streams were real cool. And we'd take and put it in

21:44.554 --> 21:49.840
the stream and try to cool it down a little bit and, 
you know, then drink it. But I'll never forget

21:50.441 --> 21:52.002
that. I mean, you know, those guys, they could work 
deals on stuff. And, you know, if we needed a

21:54.945 --> 22:01.532
particular, you know, weapon or something like 
that out there, you know, a lot of times, you know,

22:02.069 --> 22:17.424
Especially when we were in the small groups of 
special force type thing, you know, when the first

22:02.069 --> 22:17.424
calve, we would use AKs and shoot those because if 
we were out there and had an ambush and we started

22:02.069 --> 22:17.424
shooting M16s, the enemy would know we would be 
there. Whereas if we were shooting AKs, it would

22:17.945 --> 22:23.290
sound just like them, so they really wouldn't know 
any different. So we would always get extra rounds

22:23.310 --> 22:28.535
and stuff like that from those guys. You know, we 
could always pick up stuff from the black market

22:28.575 --> 22:31.198
anywhere to get the AKs and stuff like that, we were 
able to pick up enemy weapons and extra rounds. Did

22:37.070 --> 22:39.273
you have to go through black guys to get the AKs? 
Usually, yeah. Wow, I didn't realize that they had

22:41.356 --> 22:45.102
controlled so much of the black market. They did. 
There again, it wasn't everywhere, but if you

22:45.783 --> 22:51.311
wanted something, you knew you could go get it if 
you had the money to pay for it. Well, on the black

22:53.053 --> 22:58.100
market, were there also Claymore mines? Yeah, you 
could get anything just about. on the black

23:00.220 --> 23:01.402
market. You know, those guys, BC's could, yeah, 
they could buy it too, I'm sure. I mean, those guys,

23:05.207 --> 23:08.232
they had everything we had. So, from that 
standpoint, you know, we never knew who the real

23:09.153 --> 23:14.421
enemy was, so to speak, you know. Right, exactly. 
So, you know, it's a situation, you know, they

23:17.766 --> 23:28.422
always, you know, they had a good supply of stuff as 
we did, and that goes back to the Arvins, where we

23:17.766 --> 23:28.422
supplied them in that fire base, and A week later, 
they overran the fire base and took everything we

23:28.874 --> 23:32.479
gave them. So we knew the enemy had all the mines and 
cannons and bullets and everything. I mean, here

23:37.005 --> 23:43.474
we were getting shot at us with our own stuff 
because the Arvins let them have it. Well, that

23:44.816 --> 23:48.221
leads to some general questions. And do you think 
that the U.S. could have ever won that war? I really

23:53.809 --> 23:54.490
do. The way they fought it, or maybe if they... the 
thing that it would have taken it probably would

23:57.916 --> 24:27.653
have killed more civilians than it did but it would 
have killed less people overall and it would have

23:57.916 --> 24:27.653
taken a lot less years but they should have gone in 
with massive strikes and massive overruns and

23:57.916 --> 24:27.653
just basically just marched through the whole 
country and took it away from them and they could

23:57.916 --> 24:27.653
have done that because they knew where the enemy 
was But the enemy would set up in villages. They'd

24:31.579 --> 24:33.061
set up in near villages. And if they went in with an 
airstrike, they always took the chance of killing

24:33.681 --> 24:40.431
the villagers and killing the friendlies, and 
they didn't want to do that. So then they did the

24:41.192 --> 24:48.562
hit-and-miss type thing, and it took years and 
years and years, and nobody ever won. Or at least we

24:49.383 --> 24:50.384
sure didn't. But I personally feel if they would 
have gone in with massive strikes... They could

24:57.198 --> 25:03.306
have overtaken it, and it would have cost some 
lives, but it would have saved more than it cost.

25:04.348 --> 25:08.373
And that's just from what I saw from the 
intelligence part of it. Of course, my first six

25:08.393 --> 25:15.543
months in country, I knew nothing about this 
because I was just an infantry soldier doing what I

25:08.393 --> 25:15.543
was told. But after I got into the intelligence 
part and saw that they actually knew where the

25:15.903 --> 25:26.057
enemy was, they knew how much enemy was out there, 
they knew where they were going and what they were

25:15.903 --> 25:26.057
doing, all they had to do was go in there and wipe 
them out. And, yeah, that's what, you know, our

25:26.948 --> 25:31.712
intelligence was far superior to theirs. 
Speaking of intelligence, supposedly from

25:32.513 --> 25:49.587
around 65 to 68, the military intelligence put the 
enemy's strength at less than 300,000, while the

25:32.513 --> 25:49.587
CIA at that time put it at twice that. I think the 
300,000 is a very realistic number. Wow. Because

25:56.615 --> 25:59.258
there wasn't that many there. The numbers weren't 
there. What was the enemy's strength in 70? Well,

26:06.807 --> 26:15.076
I'm going to say probably it was closer down to the 
100,000 mark, somewhere in that range. The

26:15.837 --> 26:17.900
numbers just weren't there at all. They had pulled 
back into Cambodia. They were back into North

26:21.043 --> 26:22.885
Vietnam. There was not that many troops in South 
Vietnam at the time. And the ones that were there

26:28.108 --> 26:33.076
were just in small areas and small companies and 
stuff. So it wasn't a major masses of companies and

26:33.096 --> 26:38.805
battalions and stuff like that. So yeah, it was 
spread out over the whole country, but it wasn't

26:39.927 --> 26:45.977
the numbers in the area from that standpoint. Do 
you think we belong to Vietnam to begin with? Do you

26:49.454 --> 26:53.981
think there was an actual cause that was worth 
fighting for? I think so. And I think the people in

26:56.004 --> 27:15.053
the upper government, of course, anything you can 
do to promote freedom, democracy, whatever, for

26:56.004 --> 27:15.053
anybody, to give them a chance to stand on their own 
is worth a cause. The loss of lives and the loss of

27:15.775 --> 27:22.583
money, equipment, everything, that's hard to 
justify that. I mean, there again, the way it was

27:23.564 --> 27:27.549
gone about was probably wrong. I don't think there 
will ever be another conflict like that because

27:27.629 --> 27:31.534
they learned from it. But you look at, like, France 
and Germany nowadays and what went through World

27:32.355 --> 27:39.123
War I and World War II. And Korea. Korea still is 
having major conflicts, but they do have a free

27:40.484 --> 27:45.310
government. And so, I mean, they had those going 
on, so they said, why not Vietnam, too? Give them a

27:52.161 --> 27:54.244
chance. So I think the idea and the concept was 
good. It just was not properly carried out. What

27:59.269 --> 28:00.891
was your concept at the Vietnam government? What 
did you know about the... Not a whole lot. I didn't

28:03.834 --> 28:09.720
really get any of the major cities or major 
government whatsoever, you know, because we were

28:03.834 --> 28:09.720
almost all the way out. What little reading I did do 
about it, you know, They basically wanted stuff,

28:13.842 --> 28:28.499
but their economy was so poor and so, you know, I 
don't know, diluted, whatever the proper term is,

28:13.842 --> 28:28.499
that it could not properly be carried out. And the 
rich had rich and the poor were poor, but there was

28:29.601 --> 28:34.647
no in-between. And so, therefore, the economy 
part of it was very, very, you know, There was 99%

28:42.057 --> 28:45.742
poor people and 1% rich people type thing. And they 
needed a major turnaround in their economy. And I

28:49.907 --> 28:52.130
guess the poor just didn't care. I mean, they had 
their little village and their little rice paddy

28:52.851 --> 28:58.939
and did their farming, and they could care less 
about the rest of the world. And here comes these

28:59.600 --> 29:01.802
guys, and they're shooting everybody up. You 
know, what the hell are you doing in my village in

29:02.063 --> 29:04.446
the middle of nowhere? They could care less. So, 
you know, the city's... Saigon, you know, the

29:10.492 --> 29:18.119
major cities, they really needed to be, you know, 
saved, so to speak. But the villagers, they were

29:18.139 --> 29:20.061
perfectly happy. They could care less. And 
they're the ones that really suffered more in the

29:21.502 --> 29:25.686
cities because the cities were pretty secure. So, 
you know, it's really a weird thing. It's kind of a,

29:30.430 --> 29:33.332
you know, catch-22 type thing. You damn if you do 
and you damn if you don't type deal. What do you

29:36.515 --> 29:38.457
think the military... or we as Americans have 
learned anything? I think so. Do you think the

29:43.166 --> 29:44.789
military has learned? Well, the Goddard Granada 
incident, for example, just recently. They went

29:50.317 --> 29:56.867
in full bore, came in with a lot of force, took the 
island, secured it. Bam, they're there. If they

29:59.491 --> 30:03.316
would have done that in Vietnam, it wouldn't have 
went on forever. From day one. Day one. So, I mean,

30:05.419 --> 30:07.903
military training... needs to be updated, which 
it probably has been since then. And I think they

30:11.508 --> 30:15.412
spent a lot more money on the military since then. 
At the same time, they learned from their

30:15.452 --> 30:21.257
mistakes. They know what they need to do. And the 
president obviously has spent lots and lots and

30:23.760 --> 30:29.905
lots of money trying to keep it up. So I think 
because of that, they will not make the same

30:29.925 --> 30:36.912
mistake of going in in a fashion of not overrunning 
and taking, and they're not going to take anything

30:37.465 --> 30:41.150
off anybody anymore. And I think they took too much 
off the North Vietnamese, if you know what I mean.

30:44.895 --> 30:48.260
They just sit back and were passive rather than 
active. And I think you'll see if there is another

30:48.280 --> 30:52.325
war ever, it'll be a very active war. It'll be a 
short run, bam, bam, it'll be over type thing. Oh,

30:58.294 --> 31:04.502
what are your general views about Vietnamese 
before and after it? Before, I had no view at all

31:04.769 --> 31:09.435
because I really didn't know any. I personally, at 
this time, don't.

31:16.165 --> 31:16.585
I don't know. I still don't like them because, you 
know, this is just a general type thing. I don't

31:23.334 --> 31:32.667
know any personally, although when they first 
started filtering in to here, you know,

31:23.334 --> 31:32.667
especially in the fishing villages and stuff like 
that and shrimping and stuff, I really had a real

31:33.102 --> 31:36.327
bad taste in my mouth for them. Not that I wanted to 
go kill any of them or anything like that, but I

31:36.667 --> 31:40.754
didn't think they belonged here. But at the same 
time, you think we didn't belong over there

31:41.395 --> 31:44.760
either. So if they're willing to work and have a 
living and support themselves, I really can't

31:45.321 --> 31:51.710
argue with it. But I felt our government gave them 
too much.

31:56.778 --> 32:02.046
Their subsidies and stuff like that, they brought 
them here, they put them in business, they paid

31:56.778 --> 32:02.046
them to work. You know, they supported them, and I 
think we subsidized them way, way too far. And, I

32:08.666 --> 32:12.590
mean, there's a lot of... You think we subsidized 
them too far in Vietnam, maybe, too? Possibly.

32:13.751 --> 32:14.011
Okay. Very possibly. There's a lot of Vietnamese 
that are better off than Americans because of the

32:15.933 --> 32:21.758
government. If the government would subsidize 
some of these guys out here, the farmers and stuff

32:21.778 --> 32:27.023
like that, they'd be back on their feet, too. So, 
you know, it's kind of a weird situation. So I've

32:30.406 --> 32:32.168
kind of got a bitter taste... form in all honesty 
not that I know any of them personally or anything

32:32.367 --> 33:00.366
personal grudges or anything like that but I just 
you see one and all you think about is war and you

32:32.367 --> 33:00.366
know so from that standpoint it's really tough to 
like them did you ever consider them a second class

32:32.367 --> 33:00.366
citizen when you were in Vietnam no not at all ever 
look down on them no no I never that never even

32:32.367 --> 33:00.366
mattered I mean they were You know, they're human 
beings. They're the same level. Everybody's

33:03.179 --> 33:03.859
human. You know, there's no upper or lower class. 
There was richer and poorer, but nobody was second

33:05.962 --> 33:09.847
class. You know, everybody was equal. Even though 
they didn't have the modern facilities we have.

33:15.955 --> 33:17.077
They were nice. Some of them, you know, that we did 
get to know and meet were just super people. I mean,

33:21.442 --> 33:25.107
you know, especially in the outer line villages in 
the middle of nowhere. I mean, you walk up on, you

33:25.127 --> 33:28.311
know, a village and come in there and, You know, 
they'd greet you and they'd feed you and they'd be

33:28.612 --> 33:35.640
nice and helpful and friendly and, you know, 
number one GI, you know, this sort of thing. And,

33:35.740 --> 33:38.663
you know, you were the greatest person in the 
world. And, you know, they'd mama sign, you know,

33:38.783 --> 33:44.970
papa sign, you know, here, you want some food, you 
know, this sort of thing. And the super people, you

33:45.030 --> 33:47.793
know, in all honesty. But they didn't want to be 
bothered. They were happy with their lives. And

33:53.138 --> 33:54.720
you can't blame them, you know. And at the same 
time, they would take anything you'd give them,

33:56.303 --> 34:00.088
too. They wanted chocolate or cigarettes or 
whatever. Gum. Gum. You could always win their

34:05.336 --> 34:08.060
ways with them. And of course, the GIs, their 
number one concern, a lot of them, was

34:08.180 --> 34:12.546
prostitution. They'd go in the villages and rape, 
pillage, and plunder. And of course, that left a

34:15.671 --> 34:19.456
bad taste in the villagers' eyes. Do you think that 
turned more villages to the VC and to the NBA?

34:25.585 --> 34:26.226
Somewhat, yeah. But, you know, it was a situation 
that if the girls were paid, they liked that

34:26.510 --> 34:34.458
because they had the money. Right. As far as the 
raping and the pillaging? If they were actually

34:38.261 --> 34:41.885
raped and pillaged and plundered, that turned 
them against them really bad. And I didn't see that

34:42.746 --> 34:45.028
much of it, but it did happen. And there was one 
village we went into, and some black guys got this

34:46.329 --> 34:53.516
one girl, and, you know, they went in and raped her. 
There was about six guys, and they just took turns

34:53.616 --> 34:55.858
on her. And, you know... Did the officers try and 
stop it? Nah. Didn't even try to do anything about

35:01.918 --> 35:03.539
it at all. Did they not try and stop it due to their 
fear of the blacks? I really don't know. I don't

35:09.125 --> 35:12.929
think... Do you think the officers should have 
tried to stop it? It's hard to say. I don't think

35:15.451 --> 35:16.572
they could have. If they tried to stop it, they 
probably would have got shot. You know, it's one of

35:19.495 --> 35:20.536
those things. You just didn't interfere with what 
those guys wanted to do. I mean, you could go in

35:23.139 --> 35:25.221
there and try, but... The guy that should have 
stopped it would have been the sergeant rather

35:25.522 --> 35:28.325
than the officer. Sergeants usually, you know, 
they quote NCO, had better repertoire with the

35:28.825 --> 35:40.456
general consensus of the military rather than the 
officers. So, you know, if a lieutenant says,

35:40.476 --> 35:48.183
sergeant, go stop those guys, then sergeant could 
have gone in there and said, okay, come on, break it

35:40.476 --> 35:48.183
up, you know, this sort of thing. But generally, 
nothing really happened or something like that.

35:51.767 --> 35:54.229
Everybody just kind of turned their back and 
didn't see nothing or know nothing. Is there

35:56.605 --> 36:04.114
anything you'd like to discuss I haven't asked 
about? No, not really. I think you probably

36:04.955 --> 36:06.677
covered it pretty well. I think if I had to do it all 
over again, I'd do it again. No real regrets? No

36:12.184 --> 36:13.125
real regrets. I feel that the age that I went in, I 
grew up and matured a lot.

36:22.497 --> 36:23.338
Therefore, At the same time, I was very physically 
capable of doing what I did at that age, too. If I had

36:31.542 --> 36:36.850
not been married, I don't know if I would have 
wanted to come back as much as I did. I think being

36:36.870 --> 36:45.622
married and having a family to come back to, not 
only kids but a wife, really gave me something to

36:36.870 --> 36:45.622
look forward to. And, you know, I got letters all 
the time. They were always late, but I was always

36:49.948 --> 36:52.532
getting letters. I actually had voice tapes that I 
could talk on. When I'd go back to the fire base rear

36:55.586 --> 37:02.257
areas, we could make connections to the Mars 
station, the ham radio, and we could call home. I

37:02.698 --> 37:03.779
did that a few times. So there was always the 
contact with the world and what was happening back

37:04.561 --> 37:10.310
in the world, so to speak. So it gave me something to 
look forward to and want to come home and be alive.

37:14.757 --> 37:18.262
But you're always alone, no matter what. This 
leads to something. Many, not many, but well,

37:20.727 --> 37:27.335
quite a few soldiers and officers and Americans 
went native. Right. Did you ever consider that?

37:30.439 --> 37:31.160
No, not really. Do you think you would have if you 
didn't have a family? Very possible, very

37:33.223 --> 37:34.204
possible. Okay. I mean, I can see, especially the 
blacks, there again, I hate to go back to them as

37:35.806 --> 37:46.980
much, but if they had nothing to go back to, had no 
family, these guys were number one with the

37:35.806 --> 37:46.980
Vietnamese. I mean, they were the top banana. So 
they'd just say, hey, man, I'm going AWOL. I'm

37:52.499 --> 37:55.543
staying in this village, and I can be the king in 
this village. You know, I got all these girls

37:57.265 --> 37:59.208
running around. I can do what I want with them, and I 
can run this village. And they were number one.

38:03.814 --> 38:06.077
They all looked up to number one GI, you know. So 
these black guys, I mean, they just flat

38:06.838 --> 38:09.261
disappear. And they'd stay in the villages, and 
we'd never see them again. So there again, going

38:13.246 --> 38:17.532
back to the era of, lasting question is there still 
Americans in Vietnam? Yes, I'm sure there are. And

38:22.978 --> 38:25.841
yes, they probably don't ever want to be found 
either. They're probably happy as they can be over

38:25.861 --> 38:27.943
there. They're not necessarily prisoners of war, 
are they? No, not at all. Any other subjects like

38:34.130 --> 38:37.714
that that I haven't covered, like post-Vietnam? 
Well, you know, I think they ought to let the dead

38:38.415 --> 38:43.101
dog lay, so to speak. I don't see any reason going 
back over there and creating any more diggings up

38:47.313 --> 38:50.037
or bringing back the bodies. I don't see that. I 
think people are there, they're buried, they're

38:51.159 --> 38:55.246
dead, let it lay. Now, I know families still want to 
know where their kids are. I can understand that,

38:59.092 --> 39:04.261
but they need to accept after so many years that 
they're dead and they're gone. If they wanted to be

39:05.382 --> 39:08.507
found or come back, they would have an opportunity 
to do that. If they are still there alive, they

39:09.068 --> 39:11.332
don't want to be found. They don't want to come back 
because they haven't made any effort to come back.

39:15.427 --> 39:19.090
So, you know, it's to the point now they just need to 
drop it and let it go. But there's no doubt in my

39:19.130 --> 39:21.712
mind. America needs to drop it to an extent? Well, 
at this stage of the game, unless they want to go

39:23.494 --> 39:31.260
back in there and start another war, I think it's 
time just to pull out and forget about it. Several

39:32.161 --> 39:41.229
of the vets that have spoken to our class mentioned 
they want to go back very badly, and they plan on

39:32.161 --> 39:41.229
going back. Do you ever want to go back? If I had an 
opportunity, I would go back, yes. Okay. The

39:45.683 --> 39:49.048
country was absolutely gorgeous. The beaches 
were beautiful. The mountains and the trees and

39:51.552 --> 39:54.917
the tea trees and stuff were just gorgeous. You 
know, from that standpoint, I would say, yes, I

39:56.079 --> 40:05.593
would like to go back, just to say I was here and see 
it again type thing. The temples, the Buddhas, and

40:06.054 --> 40:09.179
stuff like that were gorgeous. You know, the 
country had a lot of beauty to it, despite the war.

40:13.949 --> 40:18.777
And if you could see the forest for the trees, it was 
a very, very, very nice and beautiful place. As far

40:19.739 --> 40:24.667
as there ever being a peaceful country, it's hard 
to really say what that's going to come out. Well,

40:24.968 --> 40:32.962
Steve, I think that concludes the interview, 
unless you can think of something else. I really

40:33.022 --> 40:34.284
can't. I enjoyed talking with you. All right. Much 
appreciated. Thank you.
