WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:17.791
We'd get together, you know, the family, sit and 
pool our food, and have some, like, you know,

00:03.035 --> 00:17.791
invite my brother and friends that would invite 
Gay Larry, and sometimes they would bring other

00:03.035 --> 00:17.791
students. And when we lived in Red Village, Bert, 
my brother, was working the mess hall at Duncan

00:18.792 --> 00:29.864
Hall. Oh. And... He sometimes would invite us to 
come and eat there. And then we took the kids to the

00:37.795 --> 00:41.040
band practice. You know, the band would... Where 
did it practice in those days? In the drill field.

00:45.667 --> 00:45.988
Okay. Did you all go to midnight yell practice? 
Uh-huh. And we were always, like, when the band...

00:54.841 --> 01:17.895
i don't know in the evening they used to march and we 
hear the band and we had to look for our kids because

00:54.841 --> 01:17.895
they would run down you know to come down from that 
village to on campus to to see the band the uh uh

00:54.841 --> 01:17.895
other uh aggie events did you all go to silver taps 
We attended Silver Patch. What was your

01:19.933 --> 01:21.598
impression of Silver Patch? Well, the first time, 
it was just tremendous. I mean, I couldn't

01:25.409 --> 01:27.295
believe. Something just came over you. I cannot 
describe it. It's something you cannot describe.

01:37.779 --> 01:41.243
And then did you go to Bonfire? Oh, yes. Where was it 
held? On the drill field. And made of logs. And all

01:48.671 --> 01:52.675
kinds of scrap and stuff that they put in. And let's 
see, and then we talked about football. Did y'all

02:00.721 --> 02:04.408
ever go walking in an afternoon? Oh, yes. Where 
would you go? Well, we just went around Vet

02:06.412 --> 02:14.026
Village, or if we were in College View, we'd go 
around, you know, the places. Right. Now, Vet

02:14.266 --> 02:16.671
Village, where was it? You know where the 
President's House is? Oh, okay. Just across the

02:19.374 --> 02:25.724
street from the stadium. Okay, that's what I, all 
right. And that's what was torn down after your

02:27.808 --> 02:30.712
first year? Yeah. Okay, that's what I thought. And 
was College View new then? No. Oh, it was just full?

02:39.266 --> 02:39.426
Mm-hmm. Okay. The... So you didn't meet many 
people from Bryan. No. It was just around the

02:48.619 --> 02:50.361
campus. Around the campus and what we met at 
church. All right. Did you meet any of the campus

02:54.806 --> 03:00.993
leaders' wives? Any of the president's wife or the 
dean's wife? No, no. We didn't. I did know Odette

03:10.594 --> 03:14.138
Smith and Fred Smith. I don't know whether you ever 
knew them or not. Those were the only ones that we

03:16.980 --> 03:19.703
knew. Okay. Then, let's see. So you're gone one 
summer, but then you're back the next summer. And

03:29.512 --> 03:34.877
here, what was a summer in College Station like in 
terms of comfort? It was hot. It was hot, but by then

03:36.807 --> 03:48.187
we had two fans we'd put in each bedroom, and we 
tried to keep cool as best we could. And

03:48.688 --> 03:56.341
everybody was in the same boat.

03:56.361 --> 04:01.330
I mean, we didn't have air conditioning, and we had 
lots of windows. and but you know at the time we just

04:02.153 --> 04:23.453
knew it was hot we had to just bear and do the best we 
could what did a hard-working student wife wear

04:02.153 --> 04:23.453
what was considered proper dress for her when she 
was in the apartment working in the apartment

04:24.040 --> 04:25.943
working? Well, you didn't wear shorts hardly 
because, well, you know, when we first came here,

04:25.963 --> 04:36.338
seldom did you find a woman on campus that first 
year. And so when you were in your apartment, out of

04:37.260 --> 04:53.203
we had to dress, I mean, we dressed in skirts and 
blouses because you never knew, very seldom did

04:37.260 --> 04:53.203
you see a wife that was very daring that had shorts 
on, but we went like this, you know. And then when

04:53.875 --> 04:55.798
you went to the store. Oh, we were dressed. I mean, 
we wouldn't dare go to the store in shorts. Not even

05:02.788 --> 05:04.851
in slacks do I remember. Did you all wear hats to 
church? Yes. I know when we left here in November,

05:09.217 --> 05:22.617
my brother and Ralph came and packed everything, 
and I know Ralph threw away some of my hats. Now when

05:24.132 --> 05:31.478
y'all took things, when you moved things back and 
forth from Beeville or San Antonio to here, how did

05:24.132 --> 05:31.478
you move it? We had a little trailer. Oh, okay. A 
little trailer. Okay. That we moved things in.

05:37.103 --> 05:40.026
Because I thought renting trucks wasn't very easy 
in those days. No. Well, his uncle, no, no, we

05:40.987 --> 05:44.189
didn't rent trailers. Yeah, we rented trailers 
one time, but his uncle had a pickup, and we used his

05:44.209 --> 05:50.555
uncle's pickup. And during your years here, you 
all were able to pay your bills between the GI Bill

05:53.680 --> 05:58.667
and what you both earned. Yes. And you began to 
work. We never got anything on credit. And you

06:05.135 --> 06:07.739
began to work your second year here? Yes. So you 
worked for two years. Two years. Two years.

06:15.854 --> 06:23.864
Ralph worked pretty well the... Yeah, from the 
end, well, about three months of his life.

06:24.284 --> 06:35.257
Sophomore year, and then his junior and senior, 
and then he worked during the summer for Smith

06:24.284 --> 06:35.257
Motor Sales.

06:37.160 --> 06:43.988
Describe how you began to become touched by Aggie 
spirit. Aggie feelings? Well, I did have a lot of

06:47.115 --> 06:53.084
feelings as a wife. But I think when you became an 
Aggie mom,

06:54.486 --> 07:02.739
you had the same spirit. You wanted to attend 
everything. I was in San Antonio, and they had the

07:06.513 --> 07:14.505
A&M Club, and we attended some of the functions. As 
a former student, Ralph would get letters from the

07:15.907 --> 07:26.462
Aggie Moms Club to support their barbecue. And I 
think, well, I already had it when my brothers were

07:28.147 --> 07:50.172
here, you know, it began to, but I think when Ralph 
was here, it was, became more prominent in our

07:28.147 --> 07:50.172
lives that the Agus period was something that you, 
was ingrained in you or something, but you cannot

07:28.147 --> 07:50.172
describe it. What builds it? What contributes to 
the development of the Holy Spirit? I think

07:55.206 --> 07:59.912
because of the loyalty that's here among the 
students. And then it was among the wives that we

08:00.072 --> 08:05.839
were all in the same boat. We all had the same 
problems. We had the same joys. And I think that the

08:13.405 --> 08:21.939
band was something that we heard every day because 
we lived so close. And then the traditions that

08:22.239 --> 08:26.566
were here. Which traditions? Well, like the 
traditions of the bonfire, the traditions of the

08:28.329 --> 08:40.088
Yale practice, the traditions of going to 
football games and standing.

08:45.113 --> 08:51.500
The

08:45.113 --> 08:51.500
silver caps? That was something that you couldn't 
describe. That was something that really touched

08:54.563 --> 08:57.726
us. And then the tradition of

08:57.987 --> 09:12.302
just being an Aggie, an Aggie wife, it was just 
something that Being an Aggie was something that

09:14.054 --> 09:35.539
you were proud of, and being the wife of an Aggie, 
you know, it was... Did any of your friends go

09:14.054 --> 09:35.539
through any tragedies that the rest of you helped 
them, helped support them through while you were

09:14.054 --> 09:35.539
students?

09:37.780 --> 09:51.576
Well, the only one, and it really wasn't a tragedy, 
but, you know, divorce was something that was not

09:37.780 --> 09:51.576
dealt with in our family because we, there was, I 
don't think we had any. And our neighbor, the

09:53.358 --> 10:02.168
Daniels, he was a veterinary student, and they, 
Chris would come in every morning and have coffee

10:03.143 --> 10:06.227
with me. Now, they were not veterans. They came 
from well-to-do families up in the East, and they

10:09.731 --> 10:15.799
were being supported by their family. And they had 
three little girls. And Chris was somebody that

10:20.905 --> 10:29.235
she wasn't, I don't know, she just, wasn't a good, I 
wouldn't say a good mother because she was, but she

10:31.207 --> 10:39.598
was not a very stable person. And I helped her with 
the girls. She'd come in in the morning and have

10:45.426 --> 10:57.923
coffee with me and the little girls would be asleep 
and I would have to tell her, you know, you need to go

10:45.426 --> 10:57.923
and feed those little girls. Well they they went to 
Fort Worth because he had to go this a mean turn

10:58.038 --> 11:21.261
because of his and then all of a sudden his he was 
back with the two little girls

10:58.038 --> 11:21.261
and he was going through a divorce and then we were 
all subpoenaed to court And he came, I didn't know

11:22.709 --> 11:32.219
how to talk to him because I didn't, he came to tell 
me that Chris was trying to take the girls away from

11:22.709 --> 11:32.219
him. And he had, she had put them in, she had taken 
them, when they were in Fort Worth, put them in an

11:33.300 --> 11:45.252
orphan home, ran off with another man, and left 
Roger. And so when he came, he was just devastated.

11:50.437 --> 11:52.699
And he came to me and wanted me to help him that he was 
a good father, that

11:54.400 --> 12:07.755
I would probably have to go to court and testify 
because he had finally found the girls in our room

11:54.400 --> 12:07.755
and gotten them out. And his mother came to stay 
with him to keep the girls. And it was such a

12:13.101 --> 12:19.007
traumatic thing when you were subpoenaed to 
court.

12:20.168 --> 12:23.772
Because I liked Chris. I knew she wasn't stable, 
but I didn't want to have to stand up. And I knew what

12:30.739 --> 12:41.310
Roger was going through, so that was one of the 
hardest things that I had to go through when we were

12:30.739 --> 12:41.310
here. It was that. And did other Aggies help? Yes, 
well the one, the Bobby upstairs, that lived

12:46.747 --> 12:52.174
upstairs, was subpoenaed to. Now she was picked up 
from the back by the sheriff. I wasn't because he

12:55.178 --> 13:02.247
knocked on my door and I looked out the window. As I, 
I don't know, one made me look out the window and I

13:02.287 --> 13:11.860
saw the sheriff car and the, and I, He knocked again 
and again, and finally he said, I said, who is it?

13:17.574 --> 13:19.918
And he says, I'm the sheriff of Brazos County. 
Well, I was about to open the door. And so I said,

13:25.947 --> 13:27.970
well, what do you need? And he said, I need, you 
know, to give you this dollar. If you accepted that

13:33.318 --> 13:38.266
dollar, then they could put you in the car and take 
you in. Oh, okay. So I said, no, just tell me what I

13:40.696 --> 13:44.501
need to do. So he told me all what I need to do. And 
Darnell had a telephone. So I got on the phone. I

13:53.915 --> 13:58.301
went over to Darnell's, and I think I called Guyon 
Hall and told Ralph. And Darnell's husband, he

13:59.302 --> 14:04.670
would always study in the afternoon. And he drove 
me down to the courthouse. And I was just listening

14:08.708 --> 14:19.543
to everything that was being said, and Bobby was 
there, and Bobby said they picked me up at the bank

14:08.708 --> 14:19.543
because she took the dollar.

14:22.888 --> 14:24.550
But we didn't have to testify. The lawyer said 
there was enough or whatever evidence, and the

14:26.613 --> 14:34.244
judge awarded the children to Roger. Now, during 
that period, What did students, be they single or

14:37.565 --> 14:43.775
married, what were their excesses? Like did any of 
your friends in College View, were there many

14:45.658 --> 14:50.545
smokers? Yes.

14:54.431 --> 14:56.635
Helen Darin smoked, chain smoked. Now she was the 
only one that smoked. What about the men? Were many

15:00.321 --> 15:01.463
of them smokers? No. I don't remember seeing the 
men smokers. And if they smoked, did they smoke

15:05.149 --> 15:11.219
cigarettes or pipes?

15:11.239 --> 15:16.328
I believe there was one student in the Red Village 
that smoked cigars. Cigars. But I think his family

15:18.171 --> 15:23.299
could afford to. And was there much beer being 
drunk? No. I never heard of anybody getting drunk

15:27.401 --> 15:32.728
or having beer in their home in Bed Village. Of 
course, we weren't allowed to. And Whiskey Bridge

15:35.812 --> 15:40.638
had to go west to get whiskey. But I never heard of 
any of the people in our little area that would go or

15:40.758 --> 15:47.447
drink. And Ralph said that y'all weren't dancers. 
No. So you didn't go to any of the big A&M dances. No.

15:56.902 --> 16:06.997
Do you remember any famous celebrities coming to, 
other than Eisenhower, any of the entertainers,

15:56.902 --> 16:06.997
big bands? I can't remember them. We came to 
Gynehall to see them.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.012
What was their name? Jan Garber? No.

16:24.334 --> 16:25.696
We saw two of them. Guy Lombardo?

16:30.083 --> 16:30.624
No. Oh, what was his name? I have it in the tip of my 
tongue and I can't say it. Were there regular...

16:41.060 --> 16:45.227
Guy and Hall had a... A series of inter... Yeah. 
maybe before a football game, and it was usually

16:46.405 --> 16:57.980
the Baylor football game, where they would bring a 
big-name band to

16:46.405 --> 16:57.980
give a concert. And it was just before the Baylor 
game. Now let's see, were you all here in the fall of

17:01.865 --> 17:04.949
52? Yes. All right, that would have been the 
election, Adlai Stevenson and Eisenhower. Yeah.

17:13.726 --> 17:15.968
Do you remember anything happening politically? 
No, not much. Nobody got very much involved or

17:19.933 --> 17:22.696
anything? No. Most of the veteran students, well, 
they had to do a lot of studying because some of them

17:25.559 --> 17:32.987
had been out of school for so long. And some of them 
were taking hard, like, in college view the lord

17:36.271 --> 17:59.629
wallace was a vet student betch was a vet student 
louis was a vet student roger across the hall was a

17:36.271 --> 17:59.629
vet student so they spent all their time all 
afternoon well they were gone all day till maybe

17:36.271 --> 17:59.629
about nine o'clock at night and about how many 
units apartments were there in each In Vet Village

17:59.862 --> 18:02.907
it was two, you know that. But in College View? In 
College View there was one, two, three, four,

18:04.029 --> 18:08.417
eight in one building. And so that was usually your 
little community. Yes. Now did any of the students

18:14.267 --> 18:17.112
study together much? Well, I don't know, like 
Roger did his own, the veterinary students did

18:17.665 --> 18:27.158
their own studying, you know, by themselves. I do, 
because Roger studied by himself. Bage studied at

18:30.802 --> 18:32.104
home. Wallace and Lewis and

18:33.586 --> 18:46.423
they would go to the library, I don't know where 
they studied, maybe at the, maybe at the, vet

18:47.551 --> 18:52.236
school, because we didn't see them very much. Did 
you women ever talk about taking courses in the

18:54.138 --> 19:01.025
summer? No, none of us did. And we could have. We 
could have taken summer courses,

19:07.351 --> 19:14.318
but I guess like when we were at Red Village and 
Ralph was working, you know, the hours just

19:14.551 --> 19:33.994
didn't, I didn't start taking

19:14.551 --> 19:33.994
courses until I went back, we went back to San 
Antonio, then I started on my library of science,

19:14.551 --> 19:33.994
working on. Did y'all ever discuss that women 
ought to be allowed to enroll at A&M? No.

19:44.251 --> 19:51.879
We didn't, like we just didn't approve that this 
was a

19:44.251 --> 19:51.879
university. And I think maybe some of us said, 
well, why isn't everybody in the Corps, you know?

19:59.006 --> 19:59.106
Okay. Let's see. I'm trying to think of other 
topics that I may have overlooked.

20:13.293 --> 20:26.895
I guess Ralph told you that his end of his sophomore 
year his grandmother died, and then the fall of 52

20:13.293 --> 20:26.895
my brother was killed in a plane crash. He had 
gotten his degree just in May.

20:34.792 --> 20:59.061
because let's see y'all didn't go to to any final 
review uh and he didn't get any senior boots no uh

20:34.792 --> 20:59.061
but he was telling me about how he got his senior 
ring do you remember anything special they all did

20:34.792 --> 20:59.061
when he got his senior ring no i think did he tell you 
how My brother paid for it. Yes, yes, yes. He put on

21:04.981 --> 21:08.126
the check loan. Oh, is that right? My brother, the 
oldest one, graduated in 39, is very, very frugal.

21:17.102 --> 21:19.125
And he says, now, when you all graduate, I want to 
give you all your rings." Well, mine was like $20

21:22.966 --> 21:28.637
and I think Ralph's was $30. And he sent us a check 
for $50 and he put on their loan. He could take it out

21:33.607 --> 21:35.410
of his income tax. But I think when we got the rings, 
we may have gone out and

21:45.143 --> 21:46.344
And celebrate. I think that's the only thing we 
did. And I don't remember, I think we went to, there

21:48.366 --> 21:55.533
were not very many places to go eat. Yeah, where 
would you go eat as a special place then? There was

21:59.637 --> 22:03.421
the, you know, the hotel had a restaurant. I don't 
remember the name of the hotel. You mean downtown?

22:07.885 --> 22:09.066
Down in Bryan. The LaSalle Hotel? Mm-hmm. But I 
know we went someplace, and I can't remember

22:12.532 --> 22:19.378
where, that we went to eat. It may have been a 
hamburger place, but I remember doing that. And

22:25.283 --> 22:31.568
we didn't go to final reviews. We did attend final 
reviews, but Ralph was never involved. As you look

22:36.632 --> 22:42.437
back, what did A&M do best? For us, well I think A&M 
gave us the opportunity to get an education, for

22:44.830 --> 22:55.766
Ralph to get an education. And it did, we made a lot 
of friends here that we kept up through the years.

23:04.579 --> 23:06.602
We got closer to the spirit of A&M and the 
traditions. We experience

23:14.555 --> 23:22.528
a

23:14.555 --> 23:22.528
closeness. Even though Ralph was not in the Corps, 
but the students, we got together. And I think what

23:30.081 --> 23:33.687
A&M really did for us was, help us with a challenge 
to try to do better. And we got that from being

23:40.131 --> 23:49.866
close, like Mr. Putty was one of the person that was 
instrumental and said, you never give up. Can you

23:51.649 --> 23:57.498
think of anything then or now that you wished A&M 
had done that it didn't do? Well, at that time,

24:03.029 --> 24:19.607
Well, like when Ralph was looking for a job, I don't 
think, now my pressure was that I don't think they

24:03.029 --> 24:19.607
did enough for him to try to get a job. And that was, 
even though we thought it was a great school to get

24:20.428 --> 24:29.357
out and everything, I know he had made a lot of 
applications, and he would come and say, you know.

24:35.527 --> 24:39.372
And there wasn't any one, any central job 
placement office, was there? No, no. You had to go

24:39.773 --> 24:40.574
to each? Yeah. And you all never had any financial 
crises? No. We never, like when I had the surgery,

24:48.864 --> 24:59.057
one of the members of the Baptist Church here had 
sold us a little small, I mean a health insurance.

25:00.910 --> 25:04.954
And we weren't paying very much, but we, you know, 
it was enough. And so Dr. Lancaster looked at the

25:05.955 --> 25:09.878
policy and he says, that's all I'm gonna charge 
you. Whatever the policy pays, whatever it pays

25:10.138 --> 25:14.803
for, because he owned the hospital, he and Dr. 
Miller. And whatever the insurance paid, that's

25:16.644 --> 25:21.689
what he got. Oh, how good, how good.

25:26.994 --> 25:30.597
Now let's see, and he went back to his old job. Yes, 
at Smith Boater Sales. So A&M had no part in that.

25:37.097 --> 25:37.157
No. And from there he went civil service.

25:43.806 --> 25:48.172
What are the qualities of being an Aggie? I think 
really to be a true Aggie, the qualities is being

25:49.534 --> 25:56.263
loyal. To whom? Being loyal to God, to your 
country, to the school.

26:10.336 --> 26:17.813
Not thinking of yourself, but of service to 
others.

26:18.113 --> 26:22.661
And when did you, you got that first, I guess, 
through your brothers. Yes. And then through your

26:24.103 --> 26:28.391
husband, but through your own experience here. In 
honesty and truthfulness. Now that has led you,

26:35.663 --> 26:45.495
since 1953, to

26:35.663 --> 26:45.495
be active in a number of different ways. When did 
you become active in the Aggie Mothers Clubs? In

26:48.418 --> 26:48.919
1964. 64. Why at that time? Because of Robert's 
enrollment at A&M. Ah, okay. So you became a fish,

26:57.129 --> 27:00.793
Aggie mother. Yes, and I went on through. active in 
the club and I was president of the San Antonio A&M

27:05.397 --> 27:12.751
Mothers Club in 1974-75. Then I applied for an 
officer in the Federation. I went through several

27:20.446 --> 27:25.836
offices and I was president in 83-84.

27:27.622 --> 27:31.365
and became involved in the Aggie Wives Club. San 
Antonio is the only wives club. And I went through

27:35.729 --> 27:47.079
the offices and I served as president at 91, 92

27:35.729 --> 27:47.079
of the Aggie Wives Club. I was very involved in San 
Antonio when I became a, well I went to teach at

27:47.720 --> 27:56.768
Edgewood, then I became librarian. at Highlands 
High School, was there 20 years. But I also served

28:00.933 --> 28:06.161
as president of the San Antonio Business and 
Professional Women's Club. So you've been a

28:06.822 --> 28:09.567
joiner of many good clubs. Yeah, we've done, and 
like the Aggie Moms give scholarships, the Aggie

28:09.947 --> 28:16.598
Wives give two scholarships. One is a core 
scholarship and one is general. And it's $1,000 a

28:20.784 --> 28:23.869
semester for each one. And I just, of course I was 
involved in Lady of the Light too with the

28:25.452 --> 28:37.865
scholarship in getting started the women that 
went back to school. Yeah, I helped some of them

28:38.926 --> 28:44.011
with scholarships for quite a few years. And so, 
but I think that came from where we were here at A&M

28:46.253 --> 28:52.860
that we helped each other. You know we were living 
in Vet Village helping each other, College View we

28:54.123 --> 28:58.808
were helping each other. And like I kept up with 
Irene Larson, Wallace of course is gone, he's

28:59.669 --> 29:10.400
dead, but his son is one of the county 
commissioners in San Antonio. And she lives in San

29:11.981 --> 29:15.205
Antonio. As far as you know, are the Aggie Mothers 
Clubs still progressing? Oh yes, very much so.

29:22.878 --> 29:35.048
Yes, we have, in fact we're having a federation 
meeting here, 29th, you know we meet, the

29:22.878 --> 29:35.048
federation meets three times a year, in August, 
January. in April. I don't know whether you've

29:39.213 --> 29:41.996
ever been to one of our meetings. In the other 
years, and if they would ever like me to speak about

29:42.016 --> 29:48.303
this project and what I've learned. Well, I'm 
going to take your card because the Aggie wives are

29:48.523 --> 29:56.432
looking for speakers and the Aggie moms are 
looking for speakers. Particularly when they

29:56.752 --> 30:05.642
come to the campus, I'd be delighted to chat with 
them and to share what the enjoyable information

30:06.365 --> 30:31.107
um i i'm always amused when somebody will ask a dumb 
question you know what in the world are the aggie

30:06.365 --> 30:31.107
mothers clubs what do they do and i always tell them 
that's one group you don't want as your well you

30:06.365 --> 30:31.107
know mr chair that's how i met mr cherry uh you know 
that year they were trying to break the permanent

30:06.365 --> 30:31.107
university fund That's when I first went into the 
Federation and all my friends told me, just be

30:31.846 --> 30:40.503
fourth vice president, just apply for that. You 
don't do anything because that's legislation.

30:42.727 --> 30:43.729
You don't do anything. Well, I did and I got in. 
Eleanor Walters from Austin was president and she

30:48.177 --> 30:53.247
was the one that encouraged me. Well, Lord and 
behold, I get a letter from Mr. Cherry saying that

30:54.560 --> 31:10.003
he wants the Mother's Club to help with 
legislation that the Permanent University Fund

30:54.560 --> 31:10.003
was... And I thought, what am I going to do? And so I 
called him, and he asked me to come up. It was in the

31:15.852 --> 31:21.040
office that was over in the administration 
building. And we talked about it.
