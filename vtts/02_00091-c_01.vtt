WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:07.194
sort of guarded over me.

00:07.234 --> 00:09.836
He was my watchdog.

00:11.637 --> 00:22.627
The day he knew that I didn't like to go to meetings, that I really, really preferred to stay at the health center and see patients and so forth.

00:23.528 --> 00:31.995
And the day that I got in 1980 that Jarvis Miller gave me the former students award,

00:31.975 --> 00:37.665
He came over and it was his job to get me there.

00:38.586 --> 00:40.049
I said, Perry, I can't go.

00:40.109 --> 00:40.850
I'm not going.

00:40.890 --> 00:42.032
I don't want to go.

00:42.092 --> 00:45.979
It's just a bunch of speeches and so forth and so on.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.281
He said, you're going.

00:47.722 --> 00:49.545
I said, you know.

00:49.525 --> 00:55.391
Finally I relented and I insisted on wearing my lab coat.

00:57.153 --> 01:05.702
Here I am standing out like a sore thumb and he, of all things, he had us sitting down on about the third or fourth row and I was so embarrassed.

01:06.663 --> 01:15.212
And then when you call my name, you finally call my name, but when you started talking about me,

01:15.884 --> 01:19.088
I got lower and lower and lower in the seat.

01:19.909 --> 01:23.474
And finally, I wasn't sitting up anymore.

01:23.494 --> 01:26.197
I was lying down practically.

01:27.539 --> 01:32.185
That was probably the high experience of all that I've had.

01:32.205 --> 01:34.087
What did you do with the award money?

01:35.029 --> 01:36.190
I bought gold.

01:38.133 --> 01:43.900
I bought a quarter ounce of gold, I forget what the price of it was then, for each son.

01:45.061 --> 01:51.318
And I remember how jealous I was the next year when Carolyn won.

01:51.539 --> 01:56.472
I thought it was wonderful that Carolyn, and certainly if anybody deserved it, she did.

01:56.492 --> 01:59.982
But I was very jealous that she got

02:01.126 --> 02:02.087
What, twice?

02:02.208 --> 02:03.410
Four times as much money?

02:04.031 --> 02:05.172
Five thousand, I think.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.775
I got one.

02:06.815 --> 02:10.220
That was a lot of fun.

02:11.122 --> 02:14.447
But anyway, that was very definitely a high point.

02:14.487 --> 02:18.493
And I remember, of course, I can hear your voice right now.

02:18.473 --> 02:24.301
And I can hear it, but at the same time, I didn't hear it, you know.

02:25.083 --> 02:33.054
I remember saying to you, I said, you're going to have to write this down for me, what you said, because I didn't hear any of it.

02:33.995 --> 02:39.163
And what happened was, it just, I lost it.

02:39.744 --> 02:40.445
It just went away.

02:40.825 --> 02:45.612
But anyway, so Perry and Francis Goff.

02:45.592 --> 02:49.356
because I worked so long and so hard with her and so well.

02:50.938 --> 02:56.885
And I could trust her, and she knew how I thought, and I knew how she thought, and so forth.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.127
Some of the nurses didn't like her.

03:00.609 --> 03:08.818
She was not what you would call a slave driver, but by gosh, she meant business when she said she wanted something done.

03:09.539 --> 03:13.523
So they might have done it gripingly, but they did it.

03:14.667 --> 03:20.532
And so I think I would have to mention those three.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.935
You for giving me my award.

03:25.016 --> 03:35.266
And Jack, because I don't know just what it is about Jack or was about him, but he just won you, you know?

03:35.306 --> 03:44.674
That terrific smile, like I said, from ear to ear.

03:44.654 --> 03:57.014
And never before had I had anybody who, when I did anything for them or related to them in any way, would write me notes like he did.

03:57.414 --> 03:58.797
And I didn't save them all.

03:58.877 --> 03:59.918
I'd save just a few.

04:00.199 --> 04:03.805
And you'd be interested in seeing them.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.848
One of them is downright sad.

04:05.888 --> 04:12.298
It was after his illness.

04:13.983 --> 04:15.626
Well, you'll know anyway.

04:17.308 --> 04:24.841
He referred to the fact that he was sort of sorry that the board didn't kick him out from, from, from the, from under their feet earlier.

04:24.901 --> 04:29.128
Anyway, you'll read that.

04:29.889 --> 04:33.014
But, but, but he did, that's the way he, he related.

04:34.116 --> 04:35.538
And of course, it was to everybody.

04:35.558 --> 04:36.520
It wasn't just to me.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.944
I just, just loved him.

04:39.768 --> 04:51.666
Looking back on all those years, were there any opportunities for more capable service and health to the campus that we might have done?

04:51.706 --> 04:55.572
Were there any things that we, in hindsight, could have done better?

04:58.476 --> 05:00.139
I don't think we...

05:02.498 --> 05:10.549
Given our facilities and space and so forth, I don't think we could necessarily have done anything better.

05:10.569 --> 05:12.531
I think we could have done more.

05:13.573 --> 05:18.960
We got very, very low on staff at first.

05:19.681 --> 05:31.476
And like I said, and I want to make a point of it, I was forced to hire warm bodies, people who came along because there were no applicants to speak of.

05:32.114 --> 05:39.685
Well, and there were a few who just left and said, you're not serious, are you, you know, about the salary.

05:40.607 --> 05:49.580
Duane Lagan is also one of the high points of my being here because he was such a wonderful person.

05:51.283 --> 05:56.170
And it's funny, some of the others on the staff didn't like him.

05:58.374 --> 06:01.378
Were there any services that we should have offered that we didn't?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.382
No, not really.

06:06.903 --> 06:20.361
We started offering females birth control pills, gee whiz, the same day the building was dedicated because I mentioned it.

06:21.782 --> 06:30.994
And there had been a little controversy because I had talked about it, that I was going to do that, and that we were going to do that.

06:32.138 --> 06:34.521
I'm sure there was some bated breath out there.

06:36.123 --> 06:37.605
But I went ahead and said it anyway.

06:38.466 --> 06:53.365
And that, when we did that, before that we had not been allowed by someone, I don't know by whom, frankly, to give women birth control pills.

06:54.967 --> 06:57.370
And of course they were free to begin with.

06:58.750 --> 07:02.756
As far as you know, how did our services compare with similar institutions?

07:03.056 --> 07:04.178
I think they were better.

07:05.119 --> 07:07.603
In talking with, you see, Wheezy went to University of Texas.

07:08.785 --> 07:15.254
And she, her experiences at their health center were minimal.

07:17.197 --> 07:24.488
But she feels that, that they didn't have nearly, often nearly the service that we did.

07:24.468 --> 07:29.359
I guess you'd say in a way sort of more sophisticated in some things.

07:30.902 --> 07:41.625
But I don't think our equal in the sense of attitude and doing what we did with a smile and that sort of thing.

07:41.926 --> 07:44.451
Francis Goff had a lot to do with that.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.956
with the way that we offered services.

07:48.258 --> 08:03.688
She also visited other health centers, University of Texas being one of them, and she felt the same way, that it was cold and impersonal and it wasn't, we were better.

08:04.394 --> 08:13.712
If you were the consultant brought in now to advise the leadership of A&M, what advice would you give them?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.996
Oh, boy, about health centers.

08:16.337 --> 08:17.699
For now and the future?

08:20.084 --> 08:20.905
That's a tough one.

08:21.066 --> 08:23.871
That is really tough.

08:25.623 --> 08:29.327
I'd have to be completely honest and say I don't know what I would say.

08:29.787 --> 08:33.351
I would like to sit down with a bunch of people and talk it over.

08:33.411 --> 08:50.888
I'd have to believe, of course, that the way it was when I first got here was as good as any and the way it evolved.

08:52.437 --> 08:56.501
For example, they shouldn't contract it out to an outsider.

08:56.601 --> 08:57.462
No, I don't think so.

08:58.082 --> 09:09.292
I think it was so much better and so much more right when we did it ourselves, when we did it right and we could get accomplished things.

09:11.354 --> 09:17.800
Believe it or not, the service was minimal that we could offer at the old health center.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.221
I mean in the old building.

09:20.943 --> 09:22.444
But the attitude was better.

09:23.639 --> 09:32.991
Even Hal Poe had his moments that he would disappear and you couldn't find him when you needed him and so forth, you know.

09:33.011 --> 09:35.314
But we all worked.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.676
We all did the job.

09:36.696 --> 09:39.800
And as long as there was anybody to work on.

09:41.543 --> 09:42.924
Okay.

09:42.945 --> 09:44.787
I can think of only one more question.

09:44.847 --> 09:50.895
Have we left anything out that we should have covered?

09:51.938 --> 09:53.080
No, I don't think so.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.263
I'll think of a thousand things when you leave.

09:57.326 --> 10:03.156
Remember, I'm going to give this first draft back to you to take out.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.660
You know what I told you about that?

10:05.680 --> 10:09.626
I said, you edit it.

10:09.746 --> 10:11.128
I don't even want to see it.

10:11.549 --> 10:15.415
If you think of other things, and particularly our spellings.

10:15.496 --> 10:16.581
Oh, okay.

10:16.601 --> 10:17.525
Spellings I can do.

10:18.509 --> 10:21.080
All right, then the last question is this one.

10:21.382 --> 10:23.953
What are your feelings about Texas A&M today?

10:25.148 --> 10:28.294
How do you feel about A&M?

10:28.514 --> 10:29.616
I love A&M.

10:29.856 --> 10:31.659
I do not feel like an Aggie.

10:32.962 --> 10:38.592
I never was an Aggie and I, goodness knows, I don't know whether I ever would be or not.

10:40.355 --> 10:49.030
But I was so thoroughly ingrained to Blue Devil that I'll never be an Aggie.

10:50.697 --> 11:08.474
I miss a lot on campus today because I don't, and have for, well since that 1988, that I do feel sort of out of things and that I have very little relationship to the campus.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.858
But I love A&M, I really do.

11:11.878 --> 11:19.185
I think I liked it better when I knew it better.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.644
Things have changed an awful lot, I'm sure.

11:21.665 --> 11:24.090
I never did.

11:24.110 --> 11:26.154
I told Jack Williams that.

11:26.775 --> 11:35.233
I told every president that would even listen to me that I didn't like bonfire, that I felt it was dangerous,

11:35.787 --> 11:48.244
that someone was going to get killed, or, and I, you know, it's almost my attitude, like, I told you so.

11:49.225 --> 11:52.910
That's my temptation to sing, but I've held my tongue.

11:54.372 --> 11:57.596
But I sincerely hope they don't have more bonfires.

11:58.557 --> 12:02.723
Certainly off campus, I think that would be a terrible mistake.

12:02.703 --> 12:10.412
But I think on campus, what a wonderful chance to give an excuse if it has to be there.

12:10.732 --> 12:13.054
We don't have any place that we can build it.

12:13.335 --> 12:15.958
We can't build it in the front because the grass is there.

12:16.258 --> 12:17.820
We can't build it because it slopes.

12:19.021 --> 12:21.404
For some reason, we can't build it again.

12:21.824 --> 12:29.773
Two years are going to elapse, I presume, between the time it fell and the time it might go up again.

12:29.753 --> 12:35.088
I hope some positive changes can be made in the meantime.

12:35.469 --> 12:39.561
Like I said, I never approved of it, and I told a bunch of people.

12:40.148 --> 12:49.220
Perry always laughed at me because he's such a dyed-in-the-wool through and through Aggie that that's all he knows.

12:51.062 --> 13:01.756
He can remember when bonfire was nothing but farmers' outhouses and their fence posts and any scraps of wood they could pick up.

13:01.916 --> 13:03.979
That was bonfire to him.

13:03.959 --> 13:14.490
And I'll just bet that he would wish it would, that when he, when that accident happened, I bet he thought, oh, it was so much better the way it was.

13:15.411 --> 13:17.653
Why didn't it, why didn't it stay that way?

13:19.014 --> 13:24.680
But that's, that's, that's, that is one thing that I'd failed to mention that, that I felt very strongly about.

13:24.700 --> 13:25.501
I really did.

13:25.521 --> 13:32.768
I'm quite sure I made myself unpopular about it, although I never, you know,

13:33.305 --> 13:40.456
took anybody by the shoulder or the arms and said, look here, this is the way it ought to be, you know, but just that something was going to happen.

13:41.077 --> 13:42.960
Of course, there was a death.

13:44.802 --> 13:57.642
We saw in the treatment room some funny things after bonfire or during or when they were cutting for bonfires, cold weather with mud, and we saw

13:58.060 --> 14:01.645
You know what an eel looks like?

14:03.267 --> 14:04.870
It's an eel that lives in the mud.

14:04.890 --> 14:09.957
It burrows into the mud and lives for years down there, all balled up.

14:10.298 --> 14:12.320
How on earth did that happen?

14:12.641 --> 14:18.209
Well, they'd bring students into the treatment room, the emergency room.

14:19.851 --> 14:24.498
During Bonfire, we opened up the treatment room on the first floor to use as an emergency room.

14:24.518 --> 14:27.342
We had so many calls.

14:27.322 --> 14:31.266
And they would bring students in there in a ball of mud.

14:31.326 --> 14:34.630
And we would take them upstairs immediately.

14:35.191 --> 14:36.892
We would, you know, we'd expect this.

14:37.833 --> 14:44.741
Put them in a shower, get them in a warm shower, get that mud off of them and make sure that they were okay otherwise.

14:45.402 --> 14:46.763
That was a lot of fun, really.

14:47.584 --> 14:54.932
There were some fun things that happened, as well as some bad things, people cutting themselves with axes.

14:54.912 --> 15:01.821
exposure in the sense of cold and rain.

15:02.962 --> 15:06.567
And that was interesting.

15:07.088 --> 15:16.520
I suppose in a way that sort of was my formative, those were my formative years about my opinion about Bonfire.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.287
But mainly I was so afraid that there was going to be an accident and really a serious thing.

15:23.060 --> 15:32.496
All right, now you digress from feelings about A&M in your heart now.

15:34.636 --> 15:48.562
I guess I'll have to be honest with you and say that I don't have the strong feeling, read, love for A&M that I once did.

15:48.582 --> 15:56.357
I guess it's just...

15:59.408 --> 16:03.679
Absence didn't make my heart grow fonder or something like that, something to that effect.

16:04.741 --> 16:06.566
I love A&M.

16:06.626 --> 16:07.167
I really do.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.636
Let's quit with that line.

16:10.957 --> 16:11.258
Quit?

16:11.358 --> 16:12.962
Okay.
