WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:19.916
This literal administrative

00:05.380 --> 00:19.916
tug of war

00:05.380 --> 00:19.916
began to reach a climax in the spring of 1980.

00:29.686 --> 00:32.029
On more than one occasion,

00:35.401 --> 00:37.443
Those of us who met with Doctor Miller.

00:43.310 --> 00:46.054
Informally after normal working hours. Tried to. 
Persuade him. To back away from a showdown fight.

00:56.947 --> 00:57.828
All over this point.

01:02.994 --> 01:04.075
And we particularly. tried to persuade, tried to 
convince him of the reality that Dr Hubert would be

01:06.265 --> 01:33.960
retiring in

01:06.265 --> 01:33.960
a couple of years, and that if he played his 
administrative cards carefully,

01:37.349 --> 01:57.598
He would succeed Hubert as chancellor, and then he 
could have the oversight that he desired.

01:57.618 --> 02:04.268
I certainly remember on one occasion Dr. Miller's 
agreeing with our point completely.

02:07.758 --> 02:09.700
And he promised to. Quote back off. Quote.

02:18.190 --> 02:18.791
Apparently he. Did not.

02:25.058 --> 02:26.720
Cease his contention.

02:32.287 --> 02:33.428
And the matter. Came. To a climax.

02:40.985 --> 02:45.992
in late in June 1980. The

02:46.232 --> 03:10.705
board came to meet

02:46.232 --> 03:10.705
on the campus

02:46.232 --> 03:10.705
just after

03:14.768 --> 03:35.595
Joe and I, with our kids and a truckload of 
belongings,

03:14.768 --> 03:35.595
went on our way to the new task at the University of 
Texas at El Paso.

03:50.155 --> 04:04.919
That series of events for me had

03:50.155 --> 04:04.919
begun back in the previous

03:50.155 --> 04:04.919
winter.

04:08.024 --> 04:11.590
Sometime late in 1979,

04:18.961 --> 04:42.471
I received an inquiry regarding whether or not I 
would be willing to be considered for the

04:18.961 --> 04:42.471
presidency at North Texas State, which at that 
time seemed like a very

04:18.961 --> 04:42.471
nice step

04:18.961 --> 04:42.471
forward for me.

04:50.804 --> 05:09.354
It seemed rather quick that I was one of the 
interviewees

04:50.804 --> 05:09.354
and went before the Board of Regents

04:50.804 --> 05:09.354
of what was then NTSU.

05:14.483 --> 05:17.267
Their first question will always be memorable. 
because one of the group asked how long I thought it

05:18.901 --> 05:37.371
would take me if they selected me as their new chief 
executive officer to gain admission for the North

05:18.901 --> 05:37.371
Texas Eagles into the Southwest Conference.

05:40.676 --> 05:45.043
My recollection is that I told them I did not think 
God would live that long.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.851
And with a frown, they asked why. And I tried to 
explain my feeling, my opinion that neither SMU

05:54.773 --> 06:17.562
nor TCU was at all willing to accept another 
Metroplex area institution as their equal.

06:22.300 --> 06:50.417
And that similarly,

06:22.300 --> 06:50.417
the four public institutions, Texas public 
institutions already in the SWC, Texas

06:22.300 --> 06:50.417
A&M, Texas Tech, the University of Texas at 
Austin, and Texas Tech,

06:54.599 --> 06:55.180
Would not. See much advantage.

06:59.965 --> 07:01.247
To elevating.

07:04.571 --> 07:05.752
That green and white team.

07:09.536 --> 07:10.758
To their status.

07:19.848 --> 07:20.669
Before they. Announced their decision. Don 
Walker, the chancellor of the University of Texas

07:25.025 --> 07:43.204
system, called me to ask if I would be willing

07:25.025 --> 07:43.204
to be interviewed for the presidency at the 
University of Texas at El Paso.

07:46.167 --> 07:51.893
I expressed my gratitude and feeling of being 
flattered But told him that I thought it probably

07:53.695 --> 07:56.739
was not. Appropriate. To allow my name to be. 
Placed in the UTEP pot. Since I was a finalist at

08:06.294 --> 08:11.081
North Texas.

08:11.101 --> 08:12.563
His blunt response was. That the North Texas 
search had been determined. Before they went

08:18.552 --> 08:20.775
through the formalities. And that Frank Vandiver 
My former dissertation advisor. At Rice. Would be

08:29.370 --> 08:32.214
the new North Texas president. Dash a prediction. 
Which turned out to be very accurate. Paragraph.

08:40.867 --> 08:42.630
Thus Chancellor Walker. Call me a few days after 
the North Texas.

08:50.561 --> 08:51.883
Presidential search ended. and asked if I would be 
considered, and I submitted all of the

08:53.348 --> 09:18.107
appropriate materials and began to learn as much 
as possible about the past of the North and the

08:53.348 --> 09:18.107
institution that had begun early in the century as 
the Texas School of Mines.

09:23.487 --> 09:29.815
Joe and I were pleasantly surprised to be one of the 
six campus interviewee couples.

09:36.103 --> 09:49.900
Soon I realized that they had a very inclusive

09:36.103 --> 09:49.900
goal in their finalists.

09:54.098 --> 10:23.582
because the on-campus visitors included

09:54.098 --> 10:23.582
an Hispanic,

09:54.098 --> 10:23.582
a female, a black, a non-native-born

09:54.098 --> 10:23.582
American, the vice president of academic affairs

09:54.098 --> 10:23.582
at UT Arlington. and yours truly, an employee of 
Texas A&M,

10:24.878 --> 10:36.777
certainly a minority in a UT search.

10:42.666 --> 10:51.460
Paragraph, a backward look at the campus process 
led me to conclude that all of the Parties in that

10:53.633 --> 10:59.599
effort did their task with skill and grace.

11:03.303 --> 11:16.778
All of the candidates seemed all of the interview 
groups seemed to be comparatively well informed

11:03.303 --> 11:16.778
and honest in their efforts. And we began to feel 
that El Paso would be far more pleasant as a place of

11:25.122 --> 11:32.190
residence than we had originally thought.

11:35.494 --> 11:51.973
The next step was to pair the six down to three,

11:35.494 --> 11:51.973
a trio of names that would be submitted to the Board 
of Regents for their review and final decision.

11:57.742 --> 12:26.922
I learned that I had made that trio

11:57.742 --> 12:26.922
immediately after a coordinating board meeting 
in Austin

11:57.742 --> 12:26.922
when Ernie Smurton, the Vice Chancellor of the UT 
System for Academic Affairs,

11:57.742 --> 12:26.922
who with his

12:30.074 --> 12:52.268
always energetic and highly capable wife, 
Joanne, had been a member of the young couples

12:30.074 --> 12:52.268
class at the Presbyterian Church in Bryan back in 
the early 60s when he was the director of the Texas

12:30.074 --> 12:52.268
Water Resources Institute.

13:03.841 --> 13:27.739
Another stop in this review

13:03.841 --> 13:27.739
came when two of the Bonilla brothers,

13:03.841 --> 13:27.739
Corpus Christi natives who were zealous leaders 
of LULAC,

13:30.993 --> 13:57.102
The League of United Latin American Citizens came 
to College Station to try to encourage Dr. Miller

13:30.993 --> 13:57.102
to give more emphasis at A&M to the recruitment and 
retention of Hispanics,

13:30.993 --> 13:57.102
especially in the student body.

14:01.098 --> 14:07.665
Dr. Miller asked me to assist

14:01.098 --> 14:07.665
these two visitors. And as their visit concluded 
with lunch at the president's house,

14:09.266 --> 14:24.762
Jarvis whispered in my ear to accompany them to 
their car parked over near the Koch building.

14:29.627 --> 14:30.548
As we made that walk of approximately four blocks.

14:37.704 --> 14:56.856
Tony chatted with vigor all the way while his 
brother, Ruben, R-E-U-B-E-N,

14:37.704 --> 14:56.856
was silent and intensely observant.

15:00.059 --> 15:10.288
As we reached their car and I opened the door for 
them, Ruben suddenly quickly turned to me and

15:00.059 --> 15:10.288
asked if I was going to be the new president at UTEP.

15:14.031 --> 15:18.255
I responded that I suspected they would not select 
me. He asked why, and I told him since I was an Anglo,

15:20.156 --> 15:29.104
I assumed that they would pick Dr. Hernandez, a 
native of New Mexico and the Dean of Engineering at

15:29.843 --> 15:44.397
New Mexico State, whose wife was a professor of 
English at UTEP.

15:44.417 --> 15:55.147
He firmly disagreed

15:44.417 --> 15:55.147
with me and said, Hernandez does not have a chance. 
When I asked why, he

16:01.467 --> 16:27.036
told me that he and his fellow Hispanics could 
accept the fact that I, as an Anglo, was not fluent

16:01.467 --> 16:27.036
in Spanish,

16:01.467 --> 16:27.036
but that if my name was Hernandez

16:01.467 --> 16:27.036
and I did not speak Spanish, that was truly put 
truly unacceptable in quotation marks.

16:39.599 --> 16:47.190
Thus,

16:39.599 --> 16:47.190
the three names, the board interviewed three of 
us.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.302
As I recall, the interim president at Colorado 
State,

16:56.243 --> 17:09.003
the academic vice president at UT Arlington, and 
myself.

17:13.089 --> 17:23.365
Dr. Smurton called me to make arrangements for 
that session, which was scheduled in Houston

17:26.213 --> 17:34.643
at the

17:26.213 --> 17:34.643
cancer center. The first word of the name I cannot 
recall at this point.

17:44.674 --> 17:56.187
Each of us would be interviewed by the board in 
executive session after they had completed all of

17:44.674 --> 17:56.187
their other business sometime about midday on 
Friday.

18:00.672 --> 18:22.967
Further advice was that I should not bring Joe to 
the session

18:00.672 --> 18:22.967
and that perhaps I should eat a sandwich before 
coming because the session might run beyond the

18:00.672 --> 18:22.967
noon hour.

18:28.600 --> 18:44.985
When we arrived, each of the three interviewees

18:28.600 --> 18:44.985
was placed in a different room so that we did not see 
each other on that morning.

18:45.005 --> 18:57.544
I happened to have the honor of being welcomed by 
the man who had organized that splendid Cancer

18:57.912 --> 19:13.151
Treatment Center back in 1942 and had a delightful 
conversation with him about the progress of that

18:57.912 --> 19:13.151
splendid agency.

19:17.897 --> 19:27.008
I've always thought, paragraph, I've always 
thought that I was the third in sequential order to

19:17.897 --> 19:27.008
go before the board.

19:30.683 --> 19:58.547
which was seated on either side of a comparatively 
long table with the chairman at the other end so 10

19:30.683 --> 19:58.547
of us at the table with the chancellor sitting 
alongside the board chairman

19:30.683 --> 19:58.547
as they proceeded around the table for the 
interview which did not consume much more than a

19:59.388 --> 20:27.133
half hour,

19:59.388 --> 20:27.133
I realized at its conclusion that each regent 
asked one question

19:59.388 --> 20:27.133
and that their interrogatories not only were very 
well selected and phrased, but that they touched

20:28.379 --> 20:48.788
the truly vital, each of the truly vital areas that 
a campus chief executive officer

20:28.379 --> 20:48.788
should handle. Such topic is academic freedom,

20:59.159 --> 21:24.087
institutional breadth and depth, public 
relations and fundraising, student recruitment

20:59.159 --> 21:24.087
and retention,

20:59.159 --> 21:24.087
fundraising and development,

20:59.159 --> 21:24.087
legislative matters and community relations,

21:28.792 --> 21:46.331
legal realities,

21:28.792 --> 21:46.331
and personal health and integrity.

21:46.351 --> 21:58.545
One of the regents, the regent seated immediately 
to my right,

21:46.351 --> 21:58.545
son of one of the founders of the Humble Oil 
Company, gave every indication of being totally

22:00.770 --> 22:12.147
asleep through most of the

22:00.770 --> 22:12.147
session.

22:15.832 --> 22:30.574
Finally, as we

22:15.832 --> 22:30.574
had circled the table, the chairman indicated, 
asked for further questions, then thanked me and

22:31.634 --> 22:38.042
told me that they would be in communication later 
to let me know their decision. As I started to get

22:39.364 --> 23:00.190
up, the sleepy gentleman shifted in his chair and

22:39.364 --> 23:00.190
then directed me

22:39.364 --> 23:00.190
as he said, Sit down boy. I want to ask you a 
question.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.038
Then continued.

23:12.043 --> 23:13.524
Well, Texas blood is orange.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.569
Aggie blood is maroon. Can you change the color of 
your blood?

23:25.358 --> 23:26.059
Period quote. Prince paragraph, having never 
anticipated that truly meaningful and

23:28.688 --> 23:39.867
penetrating question.

23:42.631 --> 23:46.618
I paused and then offered as my response.

23:49.042 --> 23:55.152
My feeling of gratitude and pride at having been 
able to go to Austin College. as a comparatively

23:57.173 --> 24:08.344
reserved, shy boy from a working class family, and 
that I would always be grateful to that

23:57.173 --> 24:08.344
institution for what it had meant to my life.

24:12.087 --> 24:25.780
Then I continued by noting that I had been lucky

24:12.087 --> 24:25.780
to be admitted to Rice back in the era when there was 
no tuition fee

24:29.388 --> 24:34.753
and that the blue and gray would always have a 
special place in my heart.

24:40.399 --> 24:57.977
Then in 1959,

24:40.399 --> 24:57.977
with a pregnant wife and very little money in the 
bank, A&M gave us a job and we had been grateful for

24:59.560 --> 25:04.605
the 21 years of very meaningful experience there.

25:07.768 --> 25:29.348
And I tried to add that I believed that we could 
also, would also be very proud and grateful to add

25:07.768 --> 25:29.348
the University of Texas at El Paso

25:07.768 --> 25:29.348
to the institutions that were dear to our hearts.

25:36.723 --> 25:54.086
Luckily, Governor Dolph Briscoe's personal 
physician,

25:36.723 --> 25:54.086
who was sitting across from this questioner at the 
Regent's table, smiled as he said, let me help this

25:36.723 --> 25:54.086
young man a moment. And he told his colleagues that

26:03.010 --> 26:31.482
When he delivered the first child for a young 
couple

26:03.010 --> 26:31.482
and placed the new baby in the parents' arms, they 
indicated they would never love anything else in

26:03.010 --> 26:31.482
their life as much as that child, dash, dash, dash,

26:03.010 --> 26:31.482
until he delivered their second child and placed 
it in their arms.

26:36.978 --> 26:46.972
At that point, I quickly rose and said, I rest my 
case and thank you for your courtesy.

26:52.580 --> 27:01.553
As I, paragraph, as I walked away, Dr. Smurden 
asked me where the board could, where I could be

26:52.580 --> 27:01.553
reached by telephone. And I told him that I was 
heading back to the Post Oak Mall, to the Galleria,

27:02.917 --> 27:14.088
where I had left Jo. And she was simply going to kill 
time until I returned.

27:25.941 --> 27:27.422
Since there was an indefinite

27:31.823 --> 27:34.045
Nature to the Regents meeting. We had agreed that 
after 1 30 she would check. Every half hour.

27:44.857 --> 27:45.958
At the bookstore there. At Walton. At Walden 
Bookshop. And that whenever I got there, I would

27:53.906 --> 27:56.189
go. There and wait for her.

28:03.700 --> 28:16.595
And so he indicated that they would simply, when 
they, when the board reached his decision, they

28:03.700 --> 28:16.595
would call Walden Bookshop hoping to find me 
there.

28:21.641 --> 28:33.235
Thus, I drove back from the medical center to the 
Galleria at the corner of Westheimer and Post Oak

28:21.641 --> 28:33.235
Road. and headed for the bookstore.

28:40.403 --> 28:51.819
When I walked in the front door of that 
establishment, I asked for the location of their

28:40.403 --> 28:51.819
telephone. The clerk, thinking I was asking for a 
public telephone, quickly responded that they

28:51.839 --> 29:00.370
did not have a phone. In shock, I worried about the 
fact that I would never might never know what the

29:02.881 --> 29:08.410
board had decided.

29:13.037 --> 29:15.741
But then she clarified the matter. By telling me. 
That their in house phone. Was near the back of the

29:22.391 --> 29:23.714
store.

29:26.939 --> 29:27.880
As I walked back. To that point.

29:37.610 --> 29:51.787
Looking for the phone, I happen to notice a pair of 
legs

29:37.610 --> 29:51.787
that seemed very recognizable

29:37.610 --> 29:51.787
extending beyond the counter.

29:55.291 --> 30:05.203
And as I rounded the corner, Jo was there on the 
floor

29:55.291 --> 30:05.203
with the phone in her hands and a bright smile on her 
face.

30:08.187 --> 30:16.777
And as she looked up at me while talking on the 
phone, she signaled with her lips, we won.

30:22.503 --> 30:35.157
Quickly, she then told me that she was talking to 
Ernie Smurton, who had called there

30:22.503 --> 30:35.157
to inform us that I had been selected for the UTEP 
task.

30:41.401 --> 31:05.481
Thus, on February 29, 1980, leap year day,

30:41.401 --> 31:05.481
we

30:41.401 --> 31:05.481
hurried back from Houston to

30:41.401 --> 31:05.481
Lawyer Street, to 1901 Lawyer.

31:09.241 --> 31:25.958
thinking about a momentous

31:09.241 --> 31:25.958
relocation

31:09.241 --> 31:25.958
of family, energy,

31:09.241 --> 31:25.958
and heartfelt devotion.

31:31.364 --> 31:36.970
On the paragraph on the way back, we briefly 
discussed selling the house that we had built with

31:38.198 --> 31:44.125
such care and devotion 10 years earlier.
