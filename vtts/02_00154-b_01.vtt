00:01.988 --> 00:07.736
Vice

00:01.988 --> 00:07.736
President for Development, Texas A&M University 
Campus. Dear Bob, Please allow me to use this

00:08.156 --> 00:20.753
letter to record on paper at least a summary of my 
conversation this morning with Dr. N.A. McNeil.

00:25.519 --> 00:26.040
Paragraph. I met him According to our agreement at 
the Ramada Inn, soon after breakfast, he seemed to

00:30.001 --> 00:52.228
be both physically and intellectually a bit older 
than when you and I last saw him up at his home near

00:30.001 --> 00:52.228
Moody. And when I chatted with him to record his 
recollections of his days here a few months after

00:52.681 --> 01:19.448
that, I gave him a copy of the letter, which is, I 
gave him the letter in which I attempted to

01:21.166 --> 01:50.835
describe the probable cost to outline the,

01:21.166 --> 01:50.835
in which I attempted to outline the

01:21.166 --> 01:50.835
work involved in publishing his materials and the 
probable total cost.

01:52.435 --> 02:00.189
of publishing his recollections of service in the 
CBI theater during World War II.

02:05.218 --> 02:05.719
Paragraph. He, Dr. McNeil, also gave me copies of 
his recollections from his student days, his

02:16.330 --> 02:27.161
teaching in high school, and his many years of 
service here. He indicated that he would, quote,

02:28.683 --> 02:36.752
like to have them published also, period, quote. 
The most important

02:42.638 --> 03:05.136
impression I received from this conversation was 
that he seemed to be assuming that he was giving us

02:42.638 --> 03:05.136
the privilege of having a copy of all of his 
recollections and that he would give A&M the

03:05.808 --> 03:10.562
publication rights to those. No mention, he made 
no mention of the possibility of his contributing

03:11.806 --> 03:19.750
the cost of publication or any of all of these 
materials and I did not bring that subject up

03:20.168 --> 03:26.637
either.

03:30.161 --> 03:38.953
He, paragraph, Dr. McNeil mentioned two or three 
times that he thought that

03:41.853 --> 03:50.222
A printed version of these materials might sell, 
quote, at least a thousand copies, period, quote.

03:50.783 --> 03:59.793
He did not ask me my opinion on that subject, nor did 
I offer any observations. However, I would be very

04:00.193 --> 04:05.859
skeptical that such a sales total could be 
achieved. Paragraph I wanted to pass this

04:09.173 --> 04:21.186
information on to you as soon as possible because I 
fear that this could become a delicate matter.

04:24.209 --> 04:35.721
When I finished the conversation with him, I told 
him that I would communicate with you as soon as

04:24.209 --> 04:35.721
possible about our conversation. and would make 
you aware of his passing copy of the materials on to

04:36.123 --> 04:42.651
me. Thus, I want to use this letter to fulfill that 
commitment, to indicate a fulfillment of that

04:44.914 --> 04:58.570
commitment, and to turn to you for advice as to what 
any other effort I should give to this

05:00.895 --> 05:06.061
comparatively delicate matter. Sincerely, end 
of letter.

05:11.527 --> 05:26.565
These

05:11.527 --> 05:26.565
fine recollections describe your service in the 
Far East during the Second World War. and I join

05:28.587 --> 05:33.753
with you in the hope that they can be published.

05:37.097 --> 05:55.759
After discussing these

05:37.097 --> 05:55.759
materials with

05:37.097 --> 05:55.759
a friend who has a good deal of experience with such 
matters,

05:59.215 --> 06:25.257
understand from him that

05:59.215 --> 06:25.257
the editing

05:59.215 --> 06:25.257
of this material,

05:59.215 --> 06:25.257
preparation

05:59.215 --> 06:25.257
of all these pages for publication, and the 
printing of a small book of 500

06:26.570 --> 06:45.073
copies

06:26.570 --> 06:45.073
could be done for the total cost of $12,500. 
Paragraph.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.446
Please do not...

06:58.447 --> 07:28.318
Please do not

06:58.447 --> 07:28.318
assume that this letter is a contractual 
commitment on behalf of Texas A&M, but I

06:58.447 --> 07:28.318
understand that from this conversation that the 
sum of $12,500 or less would be the cost of

07:29.075 --> 07:32.760
preparation and publication of these pages.

07:38.808 --> 07:56.010
The person to whom I turned for advice on this 
matter did not offer

07:38.808 --> 07:56.010
any recommendations regarding distribution and 
or sales

07:59.028 --> 08:02.674
of the 500 copies. He did emphasize that the cost to 
print a small number, 50 to 100 copies, was very

08:03.676 --> 08:25.491
little

08:03.676 --> 08:25.491
different from printing 500 copies.

08:28.981 --> 08:46.788
Paragraph, am I correct in assuming, am I correct 
in understanding that the quote memoir quote was

08:28.981 --> 08:46.788
the only material that you hoped to be printed at 
this time? Paragraph, if I can assist further with

08:47.589 --> 08:56.322
this or any, assist you further with this or any 
other

09:00.453 --> 09:29.683
matter please let me know sincerely put it me and my 
title copy to dr. Robert Walker in the letter 125th

09:00.453 --> 09:29.683
anniversary celebration of Texas A&M the 
celebrating the 125th anniversary of Texas A&M I

09:00.453 --> 09:29.683
assume that you will be one of those 25 greatest 
Aggies quote quotes around greatest Aggies thus

09:30.338 --> 09:57.257
this interview will be the basis for for a portion 
of that manuscript the only additional effort

09:30.338 --> 09:57.257
that might be required is that I want to ask all of 
those interviewees

09:30.338 --> 09:57.257
especially about What, now in retrospect, what 
did they learn here at Texas A&M that has been

09:57.862 --> 10:11.380
important in their life since they left this 
campus? In other words, what did it mean to be, to

10:13.864 --> 10:19.131
you, to be an Aggie? And then the final question of 
most of my interviews would be used in this

10:20.472 --> 10:27.582
manuscript also. what feelings do you have about 
for Texas A&M today? Paragraph. But in

10:37.915 --> 10:51.615
conclusion, let me thank you for all of your help to 
this institution and particularly with this

10:37.915 --> 10:51.615
effort to record your memories and preserve them 
for all time to come. Sincerely, end of letter.

10:57.498 --> 10:59.641

the most informative and enjoyable of the 90 that I

This letter to Dr. Melvin L. Greenhut, 5814

16:07.426 --> 16:18.583
Constellation Circle, Rockwall, Texas 75032. 
Dear Mel, thank you for your letter and your

16:18.683 --> 16:24.252
interest in being a contributor to the Heritage 
Preservation Program, which is our way of trying

16:25.531 --> 16:45.784
to preserve as much as we can about how Texas A&M 
developed into the splendid institution that it

16:25.531 --> 16:45.784
is today.

16:46.709 --> 16:56.610
paragraph, please let me first respond to your 
inquiry about schedule in a comparatively fuzzy

16:46.709 --> 16:56.610
manner. Our youngest child, John, is getting 
married at the Highland Park Presbyterian Church

16:58.494 --> 17:05.950
on Saturday, so we will be busy with that event and 
its aftereffects until Monday. Then I will be up in

17:18.876 --> 17:30.351
Missouri from May 23 through the 29th.

17:34.094 --> 17:40.964
My wife will be in North Carolina the first week in 
June. After that, finally, things will calm down a

17:40.984 --> 17:44.469
bit. So please give me a reprieve, and I will get 
back to you in mid-June to see when we might work out

17:46.552 --> 17:59.190
something. In the meantime, if you planned, 
please let me know when you plan to be down here and

17:59.845 --> 18:16.002
might have three hours unscheduled and we could do 
the recorded interview here. On the other hand, I

18:17.444 --> 18:29.717
would be pleased to have an excuse to drive up to the 
Metroplex and come over to Rockwall and do the

18:30.592 --> 18:44.111
conversation there, but it will have to wait until 
after mid-June. Paragraph, in the meantime, I

18:44.992 --> 18:54.565
send you greetings and hope that all is going well 
for you. Sincerely, end of letter.
