WEBVTT

00:08.215 --> 00:16.163
Okay, I'd like to start out asking you where you 
came from before you moved here. Okay,

00:16.303 --> 00:22.549
and why did you come?

00:27.454 --> 00:34.881
Did

00:27.454 --> 00:34.881
you want to come down here?

00:35.080 --> 00:35.881
Okay. And

00:36.021 --> 00:49.953
what kind of work are you doing

00:36.021 --> 00:49.953
right now? Various.

00:55.437 --> 00:57.299
I'm a home builder, a real ranger. So you build a lot 
of houses in Bryan? Bryan College Station. I build

01:01.723 --> 01:04.345
a number of good places right now at Bryan College 
Station. Okay,

01:06.097 --> 01:20.459
have you ever been anything

01:06.097 --> 01:20.459
about politics or anything? Yeah, city council. 
City council? Got beat. Got beat. Oh, well. Okay.

01:30.114 --> 01:30.214
Okay.

01:36.235 --> 01:42.466
Can you tell me about

01:36.235 --> 01:42.466
anything about your children? Do

01:42.887 --> 01:50.801
they like this area, the country?

01:55.169 --> 02:00.538
Like I said, we moved here in 1959.

02:00.822 --> 02:10.291
You

02:00.822 --> 02:10.291
like the people here in Fort Worth?

02:13.374 --> 02:13.714
Oh, yeah. Period. I lived in Dallas, and that's 
where I was born. I don't like the people in Dallas.

02:24.785 --> 02:26.626
I love this part of the country. Yeah, I think I like 
it. geography of the country trees and so forth i

02:28.868 --> 02:58.167
think the small town

02:28.868 --> 02:58.167
atmosphere though i think we're losing what do you 
think uh about the changes in technology for

02:58.720 --> 03:00.882
advancement of the city. Can you tell me about how 
it's grown, how it was whenever you came here back

03:00.902 --> 03:11.492
in 1959, and the progress that it's taken? I don't 
know exactly what you mean. Technology? Any

03:17.558 --> 03:18.619
industry?

03:21.722 --> 03:24.685
What effects maybe the college may have had? And 
businesses? Okay, when we moved to Bryan, I don't

03:27.509 --> 03:34.356
know how much you want me to elaborate on this 
stuff, but we moved to Bryan in 1959. Bryan Field

03:35.437 --> 03:37.219
was closed in 1958. This is undoubtedly the 
deadest town you've not ever been in. There was

03:43.766 --> 03:48.972
property for rent for sale all over town, all the 
sports you wanted to play for. We lived in a nice

03:48.992 --> 03:51.414
three-bedroom house. We rented for a few months. 
$75 a month. And we bought a three-bedroom,

03:54.728 --> 04:08.144
two-bath,

03:54.728 --> 04:08.144
new brick home for a small one, about $150,000. No 
down payment. It was a case in mind. It was an

04:09.426 --> 04:14.192
elderly family. They accepted no down payment. 
They just wanted to rent it off. The next thing in

04:17.636 --> 04:18.497
was college then. The number of students had been 
the same for a year. It wasn't growing. Everybody

04:22.762 --> 04:24.364
was scared to death with it. The economy was just 
going to go to nothing because of that base load.

04:28.537 --> 04:31.280
And about two or three years later, it started 
making the change. A&M started growing a little.

04:34.043 --> 04:36.326
The attitudes of people just seemed to change. And 
right now, basically, my opinion, the Bryan

04:36.346 --> 04:48.100
College Station is, you know, almost totally 
dependent on A&M. The industry that's covered the

04:48.120 --> 04:54.267
town has been mental for the size of town it is. 
We've got two or three small industries, but A&M

04:54.938 --> 05:04.850
is, as A&M goes, like me. Okay, how did the Bryan 
College Station, did they want the

05:04.870 --> 05:17.806
college to turn co-ed where girls can come in? I 
think. Was that a big issue? uh... uh...

05:49.934 --> 05:58.722
requirement about being in the court at the same 
time? As far as I was concerned on the college, I had

05:58.742 --> 06:02.305
no preference. I didn't go to A&M or anything like 
that. Other than for business reasons. Do you

06:10.112 --> 06:19.941
think Bryan College Station will have enough 
facilities, apartments and all to fulfill All the

06:20.697 --> 06:21.438
students? Oh, basically we'll probably build 
them as fast as possible right now. It's just going

06:29.585 --> 06:33.309
to be a matter of time before people all went to work 
and I was having enough. It'll be a matter of time

06:33.329 --> 06:35.571
before we have too many. Because I know next 
semester they're turning down, all the dorms are

06:35.591 --> 06:46.701
filled up, and they turned down 2,300 freshmen 
that are coming in. I just want to know if they have

06:47.122 --> 06:49.624
room for that 2,300. That's discretionary. No, 
I'm sure that has a lot more to turn them down. They

06:56.242 --> 06:57.383
just didn't have a place to live. But I can say that

06:57.403 --> 07:06.073
the private sector normally reacts to these 
things and overreacts. I don't think we can put any

07:06.094 --> 07:07.655
city around. Austin's a good example of where it's 
going. It's probably going to any city, a small

07:09.998 --> 07:14.083
city in, say, Texas. And now they're way over the 
other apartment houses and everything else. Let

07:18.865 --> 07:22.631
me ask you something about your line of work and 
building and all.

07:25.855 --> 07:34.047
How come you don't build more than just two-story 
complexes? Couldn't you build maybe four or

07:35.510 --> 07:40.517
five-story complexes to hold more people? Well, 
back up a bit, I'm not an apartment builder. You're

07:43.782 --> 07:45.064
not an apartment builder? We started building 
duplexes. Now, duplexes are basically houses.

07:48.481 --> 07:51.766
And that's an hour round of thinking. We'll build a 
lot of duplexes, but still each individual big

07:51.866 --> 07:58.796
duplex will be $35,000, $70,000. There's not a $2 
to $5 million project. When I say we, I'm talking

08:03.222 --> 08:05.185
about my company. We're not going to do that kind of 
thing. We're not a commercial apartment

08:09.331 --> 08:11.013
building. And why though?

08:16.274 --> 08:19.418
I just got into this man. Oh, you did? I've never 
been in one yet. Okay. So, since you've been here

08:26.168 --> 08:44.053
quite a while now, and you know quite a few people 
around this area, you communicate with them, the

08:26.168 --> 08:44.053
people that came in, are they just mostly 
middle-income people, or do you see a lot of real

08:45.586 --> 08:55.975
wealthy people coming into this area wanting to 
live here? No, we see some, probably maybe a little

08:58.117 --> 09:02.101
more than normal. We see upper-middle-class 
people, but by far the majority is the majority of

09:02.121 --> 09:08.807
people in this area. Again, do they end up there? 
I'd say we sell...

09:15.657 --> 09:33.560
Probably 60% of our house made more than Ph.D. 
Yeah, I was going to say, I imagine a lot of these big

09:15.657 --> 09:33.560
expensive houses are probably just... Well, not 
really expensive anymore.

09:33.580 --> 09:37.305
The small, little small houses are more 
expensive. Yeah. And it takes Ph.D. almost to

09:38.847 --> 09:40.669
afford them. If you get away from A&M, you don't 
have that many management people in the private

09:42.758 --> 09:49.484
sector. Okay. Would you tell me any relations that 
you have with other families in the ground?

10:04.879 --> 10:10.825
Do you have any relationships, any contact with

10:14.180 --> 10:16.302
Say, for instance, the mayor and the councilman.

10:18.965 --> 10:19.966
I know them all. You know them all? I shouldn't say I 
know them all really well. I know several of them

10:24.031 --> 10:27.635
really well. How come you don't run for city 
council? I figure it out when I serve from once in a

10:30.478 --> 10:35.143
while. Once you're a fool, twice you're stupid. 
One reason I'm not living in the city of Brighton

10:44.723 --> 10:59.707
What

10:44.723 --> 10:59.707
was your sole purpose for

10:44.723 --> 10:59.707
moving out of the city? Just to live out in the 
country.

11:13.411 --> 11:31.855
I had lived in the country

11:13.411 --> 11:31.855
close to Brian, a lot closer than we are now, but I 
lived and we lived in the country for six out of the

11:13.411 --> 11:31.855
past seven years

11:13.411 --> 11:31.855
before I run for city council. I run for city 
council for one reason,

11:31.875 --> 11:43.350
and that was that Brian, like I said, Brian, my 
home, not Brian, but the college station really,

11:31.875 --> 11:43.350
and... The growth of the area was shifted to 
College Station because the city of Bryan is just

11:43.600 --> 11:52.932
not doing enough for the value of children. 
There's subdivisions and so forth across

11:52.953 --> 11:59.641
the bypasses. And we were ready to pick the right 
group of businesses. We were interested in Bryan.

12:04.147 --> 12:06.451
Their business was Bryan. And I was talking to the 
governor on that. Do

12:09.520 --> 12:31.224
you ever see today where College Station might be 
bigger than Bryan because of the college? Well, of

12:31.244 --> 12:36.490
course the university is there and the big growth 
right now is in College Station. Getting further

12:37.330 --> 12:51.525
and further away from the university, actually, 
there's many places in Bryan you can build and

12:37.330 --> 12:51.525
develop out that's closer to A&M than, say, 
Southwood Valley, where most of the dollar

12:37.330 --> 12:51.525
stations are going now. It's a long way from A&M to 
Southwood Valley. And right back, it depends on

12:55.469 --> 13:03.778
what the fish in the city of Bryan do, to a big 
extent. If they get these through streets to these

13:03.838 --> 13:07.101
areas to open up, I think, now I don't want this 
going everywhere, but I think there's two factors

13:08.245 --> 13:20.990
that's going to affect and slow down the growth in 
College Station. One is the tax base at College

13:21.010 --> 13:25.379
Station is going to get a hold of one of these days. 
And then there's the big, big, big industry there

13:25.399 --> 13:30.709
and they pay no taxes.

13:32.022 --> 13:34.885
These two are there for you, all the stuff you're 
all staying in. So there's no tax base out there.

13:36.167 --> 13:39.631
There's no industry out there to speak to. That and 
then the Thai people that keep getting the city

13:39.651 --> 13:49.583
government and the Thai people running out for 
mayor and council and so forth at the college

13:39.651 --> 13:49.583
station. They're highly educated people. Their 
theories on city planning, development, and so

13:51.886 --> 14:00.696
forth is, in my opinion, is all textbook. I think 
the city of

14:01.351 --> 14:25.636
Bryan officials are all waking up to some of these 
needs and I think they can see what's going on real

14:01.351 --> 14:25.636
easy right now.

14:26.858 --> 14:30.902
So you think the

14:31.135 --> 14:37.924
political control in College Station is kind of a 
little stronger than that in Bryan? What do you

14:39.166 --> 14:39.526
think? I think the growth in College Station up to 
this point has been in spite, not because of

14:40.107 --> 14:48.598
political control. I think political control 
keeps turning over the way it is in College Station

14:48.618 --> 14:56.188
the way it looks to me that it's going to be in the 
future. You think it works?

15:00.363 --> 15:04.649
I mean, they're going to have, we can't all get flat 
or something approved. I'm not a developer.

15:06.411 --> 15:09.014
Basically, I build houses where somebody else 
will develop the land. Most of it we're developing

15:09.035 --> 15:15.263
right now because we run out of a good place to 
build. Not because we want to develop. We think,

15:18.647 --> 15:20.269
you know, our business is house building. We need 
somebody else to do the development. But I know

15:22.793 --> 15:26.758
from talking to developers and the problems 
they're having out there with...

15:31.683 --> 15:59.530
do all

15:31.683 --> 15:59.530
this this beautiful theory it sounds so good and 
all that but when you put it in practical business

15:31.683 --> 15:59.530
practical business someone's going to they're 
not going to do anything let's say make a profit you

15:31.683 --> 15:59.530
tie them up so they can't make a profit you know the 
uh

16:02.665 --> 16:30.698
intellectuals and so many people give the 
developers hell because you know that has a

16:02.665 --> 16:30.698
development in the country and they're ruining 
the country and all this now but they didn't do it

16:02.665 --> 16:30.698
where they all live it's true and it's not 
practical they're not gonna do it if they do it

16:02.665 --> 16:30.698
somewhere else

16:02.665 --> 16:30.698
of course all this if if college stations politics 
don't do where I think it's possible they'll do.

16:36.622 --> 16:37.764
They don't just tie it up. I think there's a good 
chance of College Station being a big city. It just

16:44.435 --> 16:53.069
seems like

16:44.435 --> 16:53.069
so much more money is running into the city.

16:55.693 --> 16:58.137
I've been here for a year and they've built So many 
new restaurants. Shopping centers. Shopping

17:01.760 --> 17:02.701
centers. And I just haven't seen any new building. 
Maybe a little bit, but not as much. Twice as much in

17:10.871 --> 17:13.554
College Station as I've seen in Bryan. And if they 
keep up that pace, I don't know. If they keep up that

17:16.438 --> 17:19.822
pace, it won't take a long time to do it either. You 
look at the population of two cities in 1980.

17:23.707 --> 17:25.930
Compared to 1979, it's going to shock a lot of 
people. That's

17:27.631 --> 17:33.397
not including the students? The students who live 
off that campus got to be counted.

17:40.365 --> 17:46.671
When they talk about this population, whether you 
include the students or not, or the ones who live

17:40.365 --> 17:46.671
off the campus, I don't know how you couldn't 
count. I've already heard that with the students

17:46.691 --> 17:53.959
that do live in there already, there's around 
30,000. Do you think that's true? Yeah. The

17:57.788 --> 17:59.009
science is 17,000. There was 25,000 students in 
there. 25,000. We're expecting 27,000 to 30,000

18:05.638 --> 18:08.542
next semester. Of course, a lot of those students 
do live in Brown. You know, there's one fallacy to

18:12.227 --> 18:17.193
all of this. We all keep talking about, you know, 
all the buildings going on College Station, all

18:17.213 --> 18:23.862
the buildings going on College Station, when you 
get the building permits on residences. Brian

18:24.668 --> 18:31.175
has led College Station each one of the last two 
years. You know, and all the year before that.

18:33.718 --> 18:47.054
Where I would have thought before I read those, 
each year the College Station would have been led

18:33.718 --> 18:47.054
by Brian. You said you moved here after the Air 
Force Base was closed down? Yeah, next year. So you

18:56.157 --> 19:03.066
don't know much about

18:56.157 --> 19:03.066
it. You want to break it down and say

19:03.086 --> 19:09.614
it to me. You know, from

19:09.634 --> 19:14.961
what I heard. Do you think

19:14.981 --> 19:21.169
religion has any sort of effect? in the culture of 
the city? Does it have a kind of a dominant control,

19:26.627 --> 19:30.912
like politics might? Oh, I don't think so. I think 
that Bryan is probably, you know, a pretty short

19:36.518 --> 19:46.510
church on any community. But I don't think it has 
one. There's nothing like Dallas being mostly all

19:47.131 --> 19:50.835
baptismal. That's

19:51.608 --> 20:14.857
what we're going to

19:51.608 --> 20:14.857
do too. You mean to study the people out here? We're 
taking a field trip. this next month in April. And I

20:25.446 --> 20:33.817
have to plan, also besides this, I have to plan a 
field trip for my plan as all the majors do.

20:33.837 --> 20:36.580
Caldwell is one of the cities I was going to go to. 
We're going to Caldwell, and from there to

20:36.600 --> 20:44.330
Minnesota, and to Anderson, and back. And we're 
going to study not only the cultural features, the

20:44.350 --> 20:51.619
people, but also the geologic features.

20:52.797 --> 21:10.724
study how, what geologic features might have had 
an influence on people, and physical features,

20:52.797 --> 21:10.724
and how the Brazos River might have had an impact on 
the farm and irrigation, or whatever. You know,

21:10.744 --> 21:18.235
I've been really interested, since it moved over 
here, to see all our neighbors over here check.

21:18.255 --> 21:22.281
And, you never have to take the time, and all 
libraries, and so forth, somewhere I'll find a

21:18.255 --> 21:22.281
book about it. Have

21:22.902 --> 21:34.496
you ever talked to them and asked why they came 
here? Yeah, most of them don't know. Their

21:38.260 --> 21:41.984
grandparents, grandparents, one of them, would 
come over. And the other night, most of us got our

21:42.004 --> 21:43.706
version of history. We just don't know what 
happened. I know one of the elder guys had a chance

21:44.667 --> 21:49.433
to get on the study, but the elder guy said, get on 
this place. Uh, her husband's parents

21:50.898 --> 22:02.151
met and married on the boat one way or the other. 
Just a couple days. They married on a boat? Married

22:03.332 --> 22:03.893
on a ship. You don't

22:04.273 --> 22:12.883
know what, oh. Yeah. Okay, um, could you tell me 
your view of, um, What improvements you think need

22:20.800 --> 22:28.288
to be made in this

22:20.800 --> 22:28.288
area? That's a hard question. Hard question.

22:35.176 --> 22:39.540
Financial is better than community or cultural is 
better than community or what? Financial. A lot

22:41.342 --> 22:44.285
more about that. Okay. Oh, I don't know. I think The

22:50.399 --> 23:19.140
biggest thing, if the people at Bryan and College 
Station want their cities to continue to grow like

22:50.399 --> 23:19.140
they've done and have this dynamic growth, and 
become a

23:20.032 --> 23:29.384
city trade area, a trade center type thing. The 
thing they're going to have to do is they're going

23:29.404 --> 23:36.813
to have

23:29.404 --> 23:36.813
to do industry. We've got to live off of that 
industry so long. A&M is going to reach a

23:39.757 --> 23:44.643
saturation point one of these days. It's going to 
get so big within the idea. One of the reasons for

23:46.586 --> 23:49.870
coming to A&M is it's going to be complex.

23:54.457 --> 24:00.685
You know, I think people like Jack, I think Jack 
Williams probably done more riding the car

23:54.457 --> 24:00.685
station than any other one man there's been. They 
can talk about the politicians and the media and

24:00.785 --> 24:05.010
all this. What did Jack Williams do? He put A&M on 
the map. Yeah. The last, what, the last five years

24:11.018 --> 24:19.148
has done, what, 14,000, 25,000, whatever it is, 
but... What kind of things did he do to pay money? I

24:20.900 --> 24:23.243
don't think that's going to end out there. I know he 
is cooperating with the business community and so

24:23.303 --> 24:28.009
forth. I want to serve my time on the Chamber of 
Commerce. And if there's anything we want any help

24:32.755 --> 24:38.402
with. Okay, so you're saying that we need more 
industry? We need some diversified industry here

24:41.566 --> 24:45.131
instead of just A&M. I thought maybe...

24:49.891 --> 24:57.382
Most people around here, I thought farming was an 
important...

24:57.522 --> 24:57.983
It is. But farmers here before... The farming... 
Agriculture puts a lot of money into it. Brian. But

25:09.680 --> 25:14.166
agriculture won't make Brian grow.

25:14.287 --> 25:16.089
The farmer out here, he's well off. Brian's 
$10,000. Brian's $100,000.

25:21.295 --> 25:25.661
I think those towns go a lot easier to buy a main 
street than a small one. But agriculture has a

25:25.721 --> 25:36.717
tremendous impact

25:25.721 --> 25:36.717
on the banks, the trade, the stores, and so forth. 
But the farming's not going to grow, and it's not

25:36.737 --> 25:39.321
going to diminish. It's going to stay pretty 
static. And I imagine the size of a acreage farm in

25:40.582 --> 25:50.256
Brazos Bottom hasn't changed enough to speak of 
it. But it has a lot more impact financially.

26:00.128 --> 26:10.764
Imagine the cost of transporting their crops to a 
main market. It's pretty expensive isn't it? Or do

26:12.166 --> 26:15.130
they do it here in Bryan? Basically, until a few 
years ago, Bradson's Bottom, and that's what,

26:16.173 --> 26:25.587
when you're talking about farming, you're 
talking about Bradson's Bottom and the rest of it.

26:25.607 --> 26:26.128
Basically, it's livestock. You know, the Tabor 
community and places like this, they used to farm.

26:28.452 --> 26:33.419
It's all livestock in that place before I come 
here. Man, farming, it was all cotton. Now they

26:36.684 --> 26:40.951
farm grain and so forth, and they don't have a place 
to put it around here. They have to transport

26:40.971 --> 26:42.393
something along the elevator. I know over out near 
the one out here on Highway 21. There's a small one.

26:47.286 --> 26:49.429
I come from a farming area in Mexico. How come they 
quit producing cotton? They didn't make any

26:52.593 --> 26:53.374
money. They didn't make any money? A lot of them 
couldn't have gotten back even this year. They

26:57.259 --> 27:01.205
went up to them.

27:01.505 --> 27:11.338
Farming is a hard way to make a

27:01.505 --> 27:11.338
living. Do you have any

27:16.417 --> 27:29.118
Have you had many of your friends or relatives 
around here that have moved

27:16.417 --> 27:29.118
away? I don't have any relatives around here. No, 
you know, or a few that have had better jobs off of

27:32.423 --> 27:37.211
someone else or something, but a lot more. We know 
and see basically the same people we've been

27:37.231 --> 27:42.019
seeing for 10 or 15 years.

27:45.543 --> 27:51.493
There

27:45.543 --> 27:51.493
had been very few of them. And there had not been any 
of them who didn't dislike the idea of having to

27:51.713 --> 28:00.208
move to Bryan. That's true. And they moved all the 
way to North Carolina and Alabama, down to Texas

28:02.632 --> 28:10.104
Coast. That's three people I know of. One of them is 
an actual officer manager. They moved over two

28:18.395 --> 28:20.017
years. Another one was the administrator of our 
hospital. We've got a bigger hospital.

28:29.726 --> 28:31.607
Another one was a football field. And they were a 
good friend. And we still see them and hear from

28:32.949 --> 28:36.432
them and so forth. And I'll be able to keep saying 
that as they get back around. That's what I was

28:39.935 --> 28:41.997
going to ask. OK. This

28:42.665 --> 28:55.097
coach, by the way, is a head football coach.

28:57.179 --> 29:03.164
He's told me his dream is someday to get back to A&M. 
He liked A&M that well, and he wasn't that. He was a

29:06.327 --> 29:07.849
coach at A&M? An assistant coach at A&M.

29:13.057 --> 29:16.080
He wants to come back and be a greatest desire to 
come back. Be a head coach or just assistant? Be a

29:17.682 --> 29:21.626
head coach. He's a head coach at Big 8 school now.

29:27.012 --> 29:29.394
He's a pretty good show still up there. Yeah. 
Imagine. Fine school and all that's fine up there

29:31.557 --> 29:38.844
except he just said he'd never been to a place like 
A&M. He graduated Alabama on the very right.
