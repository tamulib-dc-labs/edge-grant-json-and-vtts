WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:24.823
like i've just gone through a year of bad times and 
now i'm going to get to dish it out to somebody else

00:02.647 --> 00:24.823
and and i even as a freshman i began to think that 
that was a rather unprogressive

00:02.647 --> 00:24.823
attitude because the result of it i could see was 
that that everybody wanted to add a little bit.

00:29.169 --> 00:43.443
And, you know, and I could see that if the Corps went 
that direction that we were going to be, within a

00:29.169 --> 00:43.443
few years, we were going to be right back to the same 
state that had put them out at the Air Force base to

00:29.169 --> 00:43.443
start out with. So anyway, the sophomores were 
usually more aggressive in hazing the freshmen

00:44.644 --> 00:51.410
than anybody else. Did your official lady become a 
special friend? Well, we were good friends before

00:55.600 --> 01:08.674
we went, but he decided that he was going to leave 
A&M after his, about halfway through his second

00:55.600 --> 01:08.674
semester at A&M. And then not too long later, or 
before the semester was over, he decided he wanted

01:08.694 --> 01:19.927
to stay, but by then his grades had deteriorated to 
the point that he flunked out. So he went away and, I

01:23.343 --> 01:28.369
had not seen him since until about two years ago. 
And I actually saw him for the first time. He didn't

01:31.472 --> 01:32.454
transfer. He didn't go somewhere else and make it 
up. Well, eventually he went somewhere. I think he

01:36.659 --> 01:45.389
went to a small Baptist school over in North 
Carolina or someplace and graduated over there.

01:46.370 --> 01:49.714
Describe your room that freshman year. What was in 
it? How much time did y'all spend there at night and

01:51.878 --> 01:54.541
so forth? Well,

01:56.082 --> 02:09.516
the,

01:56.082 --> 02:09.516
can we stop this for just a second? So, we were in 
Milner Hall and so Milner was, four stories but the

02:18.608 --> 02:37.090
first floor was slightly recessed below street 
level so I was in one of those lower rooms

02:18.608 --> 02:37.090
the windows opened right out onto almost onto a 
flower bed or no flowers of course, but a sidewalk

02:37.475 --> 02:43.583
more or less. Our room had two study desks. It had a 
metal bunk bed, had closets, two closets. We had

02:56.359 --> 03:03.288
space for our foot lockers and I guess that's all 
there was in that room. And were you allowed to have

03:03.368 --> 03:07.093
your radio out on the table or? You could have your 
radio out but you couldn't play it during call to

03:07.867 --> 03:26.868
quarters which was like from 7 in the evening until 
10 and then you had a little time to get ready to go to

03:07.867 --> 03:26.868
bed and you had to go to bed unless you had a pass to 
stay up and study. So I don't know when you could

03:27.729 --> 03:36.979
listen to the radio in the afternoon or something 
like that but you couldn't really use a radio

03:27.729 --> 03:36.979
during study period. Now where were the restroom 
and shower facilities? Well that building had

03:42.733 --> 03:49.540
them on each floor and so they were not too far away. 
Did your outfit have the whole building? Your

03:53.163 --> 03:53.684
company?

03:58.909 --> 04:01.551
I think there was another company in that dorm. It 
was the

04:06.541 --> 04:10.286
Quartermaster Company. And your outfit didn't 
have a nickname? No. No, we didn't. How long was it

04:15.873 --> 04:23.522
before there were some jokes or pranks or good bull 
in the, in that dorm? Those things started fairly

04:24.544 --> 04:26.746
early. I'm just remembering that my freshman 
outfit was Company 11. it was a combination of

04:36.663 --> 04:45.445
quartermaster people and transportation corps 
people. And so later, My sophomore year then, I was

04:50.618 --> 04:58.287
in a transportation corps, and then there was 
another unit that was the quartermaster company.

04:59.128 --> 05:06.357
And so Murray Milford, who you know, was in that 
same unit with me. And he went into the

05:06.377 --> 05:12.224
quartermaster company, and I went into the 
transportation corps. Same freshman year? Same

05:13.306 --> 05:16.930
freshman year.

05:17.821 --> 05:27.954
But there were several high school athletes in our 
unit, and they were among the ones that began to get

05:17.821 --> 05:27.954
into the Good Bull first. And then there were some 
other students. I remember one in particular who I

05:31.299 --> 05:47.220
could pretty much tell from the beginning was not 
going to survive academically because he spent

05:31.299 --> 05:47.220
all of his time, you know, trying to dump water on 
somebody in the middle of the night or something

05:31.299 --> 05:47.220
like that. And there was a sort of a negative 
correlation between how interested you were in

05:48.652 --> 06:01.234
Good Bull and whether or not you, you know, were 
passing all your courses or not. The, when your

06:03.878 --> 06:14.136
outfit fell in, and was there, you marched to 
Sabeasa, which wasn't very far, But did you ever,

06:14.470 --> 06:18.997
did they get the entire Corps together? And if so, 
did you all have to march all the way to Duncan?

06:28.151 --> 06:37.525
Well, we, I can't remember ever eating, as a 
freshman, I can't remember ever going to Duncan or

06:28.151 --> 06:37.525
ever marching over there. We did have parades and, 
you know, the drill field now was the drill field

06:37.758 --> 06:47.146
then. So then the Corps was called together there. 
Right. We would go there and

06:50.429 --> 07:07.123
there would be, I think it was Thursday afternoon, 
there was all our ROTC units had some kind of a drill

06:50.429 --> 07:07.123
activity and sometimes we'd end up on the drill 
field there in front of where the MSC is. How soon

07:11.400 --> 07:22.112
was it after you got here that you saw and heard the 
campus leaders, administrators, commandant,

07:11.400 --> 07:22.112
president, and so forth? Well, we heard them the 
first week of orientation. Who were they then? Was

07:30.321 --> 07:31.622
Gilchrist the president? I think he was. I don't 
remember hearing him, but I remember, it seems

07:34.559 --> 07:41.709
like the commandant was Joe Davis, I think. But I do 
remember hearing some of those people. And then

07:47.077 --> 07:55.630
not too long after that, David Morgan was hired as 
the president of the college. And I remember I

08:01.002 --> 08:14.743
think as a sophomore, all of the core 
upperclassmen were called together and told that

08:01.002 --> 08:14.743
we were, you know, that this business of having the 
freshmen back in, they were going to put the

08:01.002 --> 08:14.743
freshmen back in the units. And we were going to be 
the ones that would determine whether they would

08:15.645 --> 08:22.776
be successful or not or whether they'd have to 
abandon that. And so I remember they made a real

08:23.577 --> 08:27.263
strong, pitch for us to be responsible in the way we 
treated the freshmen. When you went to class, what

08:34.650 --> 08:37.635
was your normal routine? What did you take with 
you? Where did you sit? What was your game plan for

08:42.683 --> 08:45.207
academics?

08:48.131 --> 08:55.022
Well, I remember as a high school graduate, I went 
and bought a kind of a a briefcase like thing and as

08:55.593 --> 09:10.507
soon as I got here I figured out that that was a 
mistake and no one took more than one or two

08:55.593 --> 09:10.507
notebooks, spiral notebooks. People usually 
didn't carry their textbooks to class and uh you

09:15.607 --> 09:42.340
went to class and took notes in most classes that I 
was in we were assigned seats and the instructors

09:15.607 --> 09:42.340
checked roll based on which seats were empty and so 
you didn't have to worry about choosing where to

09:15.607 --> 09:42.340
sit or anything you know it was uh you just you got 
there I remember you know there were all kinds of

09:15.607 --> 09:42.340
stories about instructors that that threw chalk 
at students that went to sleep and various things,

09:42.775 --> 09:47.842
you know. I never did really see anything like 
that, I think. I

09:51.688 --> 09:58.497
remember some classes that were pretty hard to 
stay awake in. And did you pretty well spend your

09:59.919 --> 10:04.105
evening studying in your room? As a freshman, yes. 
You actually had to. But you could go to the library

10:10.687 --> 10:17.877
if you got a pass or you could go study with somebody 
else if you got a pass. But for some reason I really

10:17.897 --> 10:29.533
found more than I needed to do just to study by 
myself with my notes and books and everything. And

10:29.594 --> 10:36.323
I do remember that we had quite a lot of homework and 
a lot of courses, you know, math problems to work. I

10:37.315 --> 10:46.205
don't remember what else, but it seemed like that I 
was busy every afternoon and every night. The

10:48.328 --> 11:04.487
Corps took up a huge amount of time being ready for 
the formation, shining shoes, shining brass,

10:48.328 --> 11:04.487
formations three meals a day, Yale practice two 
nights a week, Midnight Yale practice if it was a

11:05.210 --> 11:16.831
home game, core trips, drill, and probably 
leaving out some other things, you know. But there

11:17.452 --> 11:23.883
was just a big time burden involved in being in the 
course. So by the time you did all that and then you

11:23.903 --> 11:29.293
prepared for your classes, And I guess I really 
learned how to study as a freshman, you know, that I

11:29.662 --> 11:41.578
didn't really know that much about how to study as a 
high school student because I had a really easy

11:29.662 --> 11:41.578
time in high school. How much did you communicate 
with your family back home that fall? Do you

11:45.584 --> 11:48.227
remember? Well, I wrote letters. The only 
accessible long distance phones were in the MSC in

11:50.851 --> 11:58.521
a room near where the where the hotel desk is now. 
And I think I made two long distance phone calls

12:04.597 --> 12:08.924
that year. I went home one, two, three times. Three 
times during the- Thanksgiving, Christmas,

12:13.130 --> 12:15.894
Easter? Well, four times. Thanksgiving, 
Christmas, Easter, and between semesters. And

12:23.465 --> 12:25.808
how often did somebody back home write you?

12:31.373 --> 12:39.521
I remember getting letters from my mother, but 
they must not have come too often. She was still

12:39.741 --> 12:43.746
teaching school and had two other kids at home. But 
I remember writing letters and sending them home.

12:48.590 --> 12:56.098
At that time, I was already dating the woman that I 
married to. We dated all the way through my four

12:56.703 --> 12:59.867
years of dating. So you wrote her some letters? I 
wrote her some letters, and she wrote me some

13:01.268 --> 13:03.992
letters. Where was she? She was at Electra. She was 
at Electra, okay. Did you call her very often? No,

13:12.061 --> 13:13.563
never. She didn't have a telephone. She lived out 
in the country, and they were away from where they

13:15.065 --> 13:21.452
could have a telephone. And let's see, mailboxes 
were... At the MSC or Northgate? Both. You can have

13:31.133 --> 13:47.618
one, I don't remember whether that was, I remember 
my first year I had one at the, I think I had one at the

13:31.133 --> 13:47.618
Northgate that year. I guess you had some option 
about that and people tried to get at the MSC

13:48.323 --> 13:59.020
because they were going to go there anyway usually 
for something. If we could read all of those

13:59.320 --> 14:13.082
letters you wrote that first year, do you think 
they would show optimism,

13:59.320 --> 14:13.082
increasing confidence in your ability to do the 
work?

14:15.914 --> 14:16.757
I think so. I

14:16.777 --> 14:28.472
guess after about the halfway through my freshman 
year, I really never had any doubt after that that I

14:16.777 --> 14:28.472
was going to make it okay. And you never seriously 
thought about transferring or dropping out? No.

14:36.172 --> 14:48.526
The, as the fall began, do you remember 
impressions of the first football game, some of

14:36.172 --> 14:48.526
the first traditions, rituals?

14:51.470 --> 14:55.354
Well, those things have all sort of run together, 
but I I can't really separate the first one from any

14:55.857 --> 15:20.498
of the others, but I remember the

14:55.857 --> 15:20.498
freshmen had certain things they had to do that no 
one else had to do during the games, and I remember

14:55.857 --> 15:20.498
being questioned about who made which tackle or 
carried the ball on which occasion you know the

15:21.068 --> 15:49.489
next day and you were supposed to know everything 
you know if you didn't know what was the punishment

15:21.068 --> 15:49.489
uh just harassment you know it was mostly just 
verbal verbal harassment now with saturday

15:21.068 --> 15:49.489
classes there wasn't much time between your last 
class on saturday and falling in to eat and march to

15:21.068 --> 15:49.489
the game was there That's right. For day games, you 
could be due to

15:50.696 --> 16:14.618
formation for the game not too long after class, 
but I don't remember ever missing any meals, but I

15:50.696 --> 16:14.618
remember that they, you know, sort of adjusted the 
schedule in the dining halls for whatever we had to

15:50.696 --> 16:14.618
do. Everything revolved around the schedule of 
the court. What about the core trips that year?

16:26.922 --> 16:28.524
Describe going on a core trip. Well, I remember the 
freshman core trip. One of the core trips would be

16:37.717 --> 16:41.322
either TCU or SMU. And that year it was TCU. And my 
parents came down and met us at the ball game. And I

16:51.880 --> 16:55.104
think we went home with them after the game. So that 
was a big treat. How did you get to Fort Worth? We

17:02.353 --> 17:04.675
hitchhiked. That was just a real common thing in 
those days. There were places out in front of the

17:09.381 --> 17:14.387
campus where students stood to catch rides. And 
you had to have a little suitcase with an Aggie

17:14.992 --> 17:26.308
sticker on it and it was a more innocent time. You 
know, people were not afraid to pick up

17:26.348 --> 17:29.131
hitchhikers. Did you ever have, I presume you 
hitchhiked for four years? No, but I hitchhiked a

17:33.638 --> 17:37.423
lot that first year. My second year, I got a car. Oh, 
okay. In all of your hitchhiking, did you ever have

17:39.966 --> 17:43.311
a negative experience? Yeah,

17:45.316 --> 17:57.730
I was picked up by a homosexual one time who was 
rather aggressive and I finally just told him to

17:45.316 --> 17:57.730
let me out. And that was, I guess that was, you know, 
happened to more than one student. I've had a

18:05.278 --> 18:12.606
couple of others and those are the only negative 
other than somebody maybe driving a little too

18:05.278 --> 18:12.606
fast, maybe having had another beer too many, but 
nothing else? Nobody trying to rob anybody or

18:16.917 --> 18:19.099
anything like that? No, I was picked up by somebody 
that had been drinking too much one time. He was

18:24.125 --> 18:34.298
driving a truck and he drove us away and then he 
decided he needed something else to drink and my

18:24.125 --> 18:34.298
roommate was with me at the time. We were together. 
We decided we were going to look for another ride

18:35.720 --> 18:39.905
and we found another ride. And there was almost an 
unwritten directory of where were the best places

18:42.961 --> 18:51.649
to go, to stand in almost every town, weren't 
there? Yes. There were, you know, at Waco, for

18:52.089 --> 19:00.937
example, and at Fort Worth, there were places you 
were supposed to go, and you were not supposed to

18:52.089 --> 19:00.937
upstream those places. You weren't supposed to 
get closer to town than wherever that place was.

19:06.802 --> 19:10.025
Now, there wasn't any written direct list of 
those, were there? No. That was all just the... the

19:13.437 --> 19:17.403
Aggie lower that was passed on from class to class. 
Now did the special young lady come down to Fort

19:17.443 --> 19:20.989
Worth that fall?

19:23.753 --> 19:24.795
I can't remember. Seems like that she came to that 
game at Fort Worth. And how did you feel as you were

19:30.144 --> 19:36.574
marching with the Corps for the first time 
somewhere else that day in Fort Worth? How did you

19:36.714 --> 19:40.440
feel about A&M and so forth? Well, I felt very proud 
to be representing A&M and to be in that group of

19:42.142 --> 19:51.498
people. I thought basically that it was a good 
group of people. We had the impression that we

19:59.972 --> 20:07.845
didn't have a good reputation in the state, that 
people thought we were ruffians.

20:08.888 --> 20:13.433
used too much bad language and drank too much and 
everything. You know, I didn't really do either

20:13.774 --> 20:24.427
and I knew a lot of people that didn't do either and I 
felt like, you know, that it was a good group of

20:13.774 --> 20:24.427
people. Uh, and was there any verbal abuse had 
thrown at the Corps as you all marched down? Not

20:32.156 --> 20:33.177
that I remember. I haven't heard of anybody with 
that either. No. And so you were with your family

20:36.412 --> 20:40.737
and then you hitchhiked back the next day? Yes, it 
had to be the next day. So we went home Saturday

20:46.564 --> 20:51.830
night and by two o'clock on Sunday we had to start 
back. About how long did it take you to hitchhike

20:52.291 --> 20:59.079
from Iowa Park to, or Wichita Falls to College 
Station? Well if you left at two o'clock on on

21:02.062 --> 21:07.652
Sunday afternoon and you were lucky you'd be back 
by 8 or 10 o'clock at night, you know. But I remember

21:07.752 --> 21:11.439
one time getting back about 2 o'clock in the 
morning. Now did you come through Fort Worth down

21:12.080 --> 21:15.186
to Waco? Yes. And then came Highway 6 from there. 
Other A&M traditions, do you remember going to

21:20.936 --> 21:26.466
Silver Taps? Oh yes that was I remember silver caps 
and I remember the muster that year

21:26.918 --> 21:50.412
muster was a strange experience that year because 
the Korean War was going on you know and they were

21:26.918 --> 21:50.412
already described They were already reporting 
people that were here the year before that were

21:51.117 --> 22:06.373
killed since they had graduated and so that was, I 
remember that was a moving experience. And Muster

22:07.014 --> 22:14.081
was then held on the MSC steps or in Guyon? It seems 
like it was in Guyon that year. Okay. uh and uh what

22:17.948 --> 22:40.935
about bonfire your freshman year did you work on 
bonfire i worked on bonfire but i had a it was it was

22:17.948 --> 22:40.935
really a hard experience because uh uh We not only 
moved all the logs from where they were cut to load

22:42.029 --> 22:59.295
them on the trucks, but we did all the loading by 
hand and all of the standing up of the logs at the

22:42.029 --> 22:59.295
bonfire was done with ropes and pulleys over the 
top of the bonfire. everything so and it I don't

23:00.068 --> 23:29.130
remember it it seemed like it lasted for quite some 
length of time you know not just a week or so and uh so

23:00.068 --> 23:29.130
eventually I began to think of I need to study this 
afternoon instead of work on that bonfire and I had

23:00.068 --> 23:29.130
a a classmate in one of my classes who was not in the 
corps and he had a room in the old a building called

23:29.836 --> 23:34.614
Post Graduate Hall, which was behind Walton Hall. 
And so I would two or three evenings or afternoons

23:35.457 --> 23:40.858
during the later stages of Bonfire. I just went 
over there and sat around and studied and kept from

23:43.065 --> 23:49.634
working every minute. But Bonfire was a big 
experience all of my four years. That effort your

23:57.885 --> 24:03.252
freshman year, was it say a month or longer than 
that? It's probably about a month. And bonfire was

24:06.229 --> 24:08.672
held on the drill field? On the right in front of the 
MSC. And do you remember any accident? Did anybody

24:14.559 --> 24:19.365
get hurt or break a leg or cut anything badly? I 
don't remember. I don't remember seeing

24:21.227 --> 24:23.610
anything. I remember that during those four years 
there may have been a few axe cuts or things, but

24:23.630 --> 24:33.441
that's all I remember. Larry, go home 
Thanksgiving, and what did you tell people about

24:34.838 --> 24:42.149
A&M and how you were doing? Do you remember? No, I 
don't. I don't particularly remember. I do

24:47.999 --> 24:54.028
remember that I took my uniform and wore it. I 
remember, you know, not having any hair and how I

24:56.151 --> 25:01.740
embarrassed my wife. My wife now was, you know, for 
me to show up, you know, just slick-headed as could

25:02.497 --> 25:10.391
be. And, but you, you in no way were, were headed 
away or anything like that. Then you go home

25:21.229 --> 25:27.059
Christmas and you get, and your first semester 
ends academically doing pretty well. Yes. Over a

25:29.092 --> 25:32.897
two point. Well, in today's lingo, it would have 
been over a three. Right, yeah. And your toughest

25:38.064 --> 25:45.273
courses were what, in terms of making the grades? 
Well, my lowest grades were in English, which was

25:46.154 --> 25:52.382
interesting. when I eventually became a 
scientist and my whole career was hinging on my

25:52.683 --> 26:00.853
ability to speak and my ability to write. But, you 
know, those guys taught me well enough, you know,

26:03.116 --> 26:10.785
that I was equipped. I guess other than that, I 
don't remember ever really struggling with

26:10.805 --> 26:20.277
anything.

26:21.438 --> 26:25.965
struggling to make an A instead of a B. And so that 
was, you know, that's where most of my

26:26.605 --> 26:39.845
work was done was trying to get my grade high enough 
to get an A in a course. Alright, you go home after

26:40.405 --> 26:43.970
your freshman year. What did you do that summer? I 
believe that was the summer that I was a, I think,

26:47.611 --> 27:05.317
that probably was the summer that I mowed right of 
ways for the highway department. So my father had a

27:05.337 --> 27:07.240
tractor. In that area? In that area. So we were sort 
of contractors. What kind of pay did he get, do you

27:11.786 --> 27:13.669
remember? Well with me and the tractor and the 
mower and all of the maintenance on the mowing

27:14.763 --> 27:24.913
apparatus we got ten dollars an hour. And uh.. 
That's pretty good pay wasn't it for that era?

27:28.837 --> 27:29.137
Right. My father, well you know we had to keep the 
tractor going and the gas and everything. But that

27:34.743 --> 27:36.624
was quite a lot of money. So we split that. We put 
five dollars per hour back into the tractor and I

27:40.666 --> 27:44.633
got $5 an hour. Do you remember what a year here cost 
you in round numbers?

27:51.465 --> 27:55.091
My mother had money saved for my education. She was 
one of nine children, all but one, all of them went

27:55.272 --> 28:01.663
to college. That was. A very unusual family. Not 
all of them graduated, you know. Some of them

28:07.461 --> 28:10.286
graduated from two-year institutions. I think 
one of them didn't go but one year. But all of them

28:13.691 --> 28:17.576
but one taught at some time in their life. So mother 
had, at great personal sacrifice, had saved money

28:18.077 --> 28:28.232
for me to go to school and for the other, my brother 
and sister too. And so I had $1,000 for the first

28:28.272 --> 28:34.281
year, for each year actually. And I remember that I 
had a couple of hundred dollars left when the year

28:34.632 --> 28:40.501
was over. So it was about $800. What did you, for 
your spending money, what did you spend it on while

28:43.185 --> 28:49.616
you were here?

28:54.503 --> 29:00.673
We had an early meal on Sunday evening that was 
always cold cuts. And so that was sort of either

29:01.328 --> 29:13.426
Saturday evening or Sunday evening, it was not too 
unusual for guys to go out and eat someplace off

29:01.328 --> 29:13.426
campus. And that was about it. I can't remember. 
Where did, if you did, where did you eat? Well there

29:22.270 --> 29:39.796
was a very limited number of places but I remember 
there was a grocery store in North Bryan called

29:22.270 --> 29:39.796
Wehrman's that was had a sort of a auxiliary dining 
room there and we went there a lot. We went to uh it

29:39.816 --> 29:50.792
was kind of a general restaurant at North Gate and I 
can't remember the name of it uh a lot of guys went to

29:39.816 --> 29:50.792
a restaurant at the building still there called 
Youngbloods. I guess I went there a few times. We

29:57.499 --> 30:13.017
would go to Kelly's in downtown Bryan and Hotart's 
Cafeteria and Kelly's was a hotel coffee shop I

29:57.499 --> 30:13.017
think and

30:16.220 --> 30:20.846
There were two or three drive-ins on College 
Avenue. The Texan was a drive-in, and there was

30:20.906 --> 30:33.604
another one, I don't remember what the name of it 
was, but there were... Was Martin's BBQ going

30:20.906 --> 30:33.604
then? I believe it was, but it had the aura of being 
more of a beer joint than a food place, at least to

30:34.465 --> 30:46.041
me, I don't know. I know that you were not a drinker. 
Did you have any personal policy that if they

30:48.648 --> 30:53.795
served alcohol, you didn't go? No. No, I didn't 
that, but there were some places that you just had

30:54.556 --> 31:07.594
the impression that the food service was totally 
secondary. Now, was Uncle Ed's going in that Hard

31:08.295 --> 31:11.079
Liquors? I'm not sure I know. Down Welborn Road? I 
don't know exactly when it was there. I don't

31:18.999 --> 31:21.852
remember that at all. It was a Czech man.
