00:03.355 --> 00:17.070
In

00:03.355 --> 00:17.070
November of 63, I

00:03.355 --> 00:17.070
was finishing up my last extra semester. This was 
the makeup semester to get my degree, and I had an

00:17.470 --> 00:21.574
English exam. Of course, back in those days, the 
semester ended after Christmas sometime in early

00:21.594 --> 00:27.861
January. and so this was like a mid mid semester 
exam that we're coming up for and I was on my way from

00:28.853 --> 00:54.810
the MSC over to take this I'd had lunch over at the 
MSC and was on my way over to take this midterm exam

00:28.853 --> 00:54.810
when I was walking across the campus and noticed 
how somber everyone and a lot of folks were

00:28.853 --> 00:54.810
listening to radios and everything and so I asked 
somebody as I was going along they said the

00:28.853 --> 00:54.810
president's been has been shot at and looks like he 
has been hit so then I got on over and as I got to the

00:55.617 --> 01:23.447
academic building and started up somebody else 
had a little portable radio or maybe had come out of

00:55.617 --> 01:23.447
the building talking about it and I said well what 
happened to Kennedy and they said well he's been

00:55.617 --> 01:23.447
shot and he's at the hospital we don't know well by 
the time I got up to the classroom and sat down when

00:55.617 --> 01:23.447
the professor came in to start administering the 
exam He said, fellas, I know this is going to be

01:23.849 --> 01:28.776
really distracting to you. He said, the president 
has been shot. Most of you know that, but we just got

01:31.039 --> 01:33.983
word that the president died. So the president's 
been assassinated. He said, but because of the

01:36.907 --> 01:43.436
timing and the scheduling that we have to go 
through, I can't dismiss the class. He said, I'd

01:43.456 --> 01:47.882
like to do that, but we just can't do that because 
there's no makeup available. so but I want you all

01:48.503 --> 02:12.098
to concentrate on this do the best you can and I'll 
take this into consideration and then if when you

01:48.503 --> 02:12.098
get your grades you want to come back one-on-one 
and do a retake or do some supplemental stuff to

01:48.503 --> 02:12.098
improve your scores he said I'll consider that and 
I thought that was a very Enlightened way to do

02:13.023 --> 02:40.785
things and I always appreciated profs that were 
tough and demanding and expected you to learn

02:13.023 --> 02:40.785
stuff but also were flexible enough that you know 
if you came in and said you know I had a bad night or

02:13.023 --> 02:40.785
there's been a death in the family or

02:13.023 --> 02:40.785
sometimes even if you were it was your own fault you 
were making excuses sometimes if they saw you were

02:13.023 --> 02:40.785
willing to come in and put some extra effort and 
that your grades were important to you, not only

02:41.103 --> 02:56.878
your grades, but actually learning something was 
important to you, they usually would accommodate

02:41.103 --> 02:56.878
you.

02:57.058 --> 03:06.267
During that day, describe the student body in 
general, their attitudes, their values, their

02:57.058 --> 03:06.267
diversity, their economics. What was the Aggie 
student body like?

03:15.460 --> 03:21.532
My

03:15.460 --> 03:21.532
impression was it was just, it was normal. Nothing 
really stands

03:21.712 --> 03:26.702
out. It was just a reflection of the late 50s and the 
early 60s.

03:38.495 --> 04:00.807
I know one of the things that was happening then was 
of course the Civil Rights Movement was in its

03:38.495 --> 04:00.807
embryonic stages then and

03:38.495 --> 04:00.807
some of the people got involved in that but they 
weren't very many and a lot of people you know just

04:02.862 --> 04:32.802
kind of shrugged you know if there was a march in 
Selma or something that somebody said well you

04:02.862 --> 04:32.802
know it varied considerably among my the folks in 
my Sunday school class and at church

04:02.862 --> 04:32.802
the ideals were more enlightened because I mean 
after all if you're going to spend a lot of money and

04:02.862 --> 04:32.802
pay missionaries to do Christian work in Africa 
you know why would you treat people in an

04:33.727 --> 04:36.990
unchristian-like way here in the United States. I 
never really understood slavery and redneck

04:37.071 --> 04:43.818
bigotry anyway. And in the summer of 63, between 
when my class graduated and I went back for my last

04:44.599 --> 05:02.738
semester to finish my English degree, I went to 
East Africa on a project called Operation

04:44.599 --> 05:02.738
Crossroads and spent several months doing a a 
summer version of a Peace Corps-type project. And

05:08.700 --> 05:28.692
yet when I was raising money for that in the spring 
of 63, I actually had one of my classmates' fathers

05:08.700 --> 05:28.692
ask me, you know, he said, well, how come you want to 
go to Africa and live with those niggers over

05:08.700 --> 05:28.692
there? And so there were Still redneck attitudes 
in East Texas, but I never really ran across that

05:32.165 --> 05:39.796
much among my generation of folks. I mean, there 
were some with prejudices and some didn't want

05:39.816 --> 05:57.041
women or blacks coming to A&M, but most of them 
were, you know, kind of open and interested and

05:39.816 --> 05:57.041
kind of willing to evolve and just looking for 
leadership. In economic background, generalize

05:57.322 --> 06:01.648
about the Aggies then. I would say middle

06:02.152 --> 06:08.780
to lower middle class. Of course, America's not 
supposed to have classes, but just economic

06:08.840 --> 06:14.927
strata. And

06:15.048 --> 06:29.425
I guess really smart kids, if they had guidance, 
would have ended up at Rice or Harvard or MIT or

06:15.048 --> 06:29.425
whatever. Stanford or someplace, if someone 
guided them. I'd never ever, I'd never even

06:32.851 --> 06:38.823
considered all through high school a service 
academy. Nobody had ever incurred, I didn't even

06:38.923 --> 06:41.788
know about it. I might could have qualified, I 
don't know. I might could have qualified for Rice

06:45.154 --> 06:50.805
if I had applied, I don't know.

06:52.338 --> 07:08.608
I just, you know, I'd always wanted to be an Aggie, 
so a lot of times when people looked down on A&M back

06:52.338 --> 07:08.608
then, and maybe some of it still lingers today, 
when people say, well, it's just a little ag

06:52.338 --> 07:08.608
college in Backwater. I don't really pay any 
attention to that because I think A&M's got plenty

07:09.652 --> 07:37.583
to be proud of and I think it's a world-class 
university and has been for years and years and

07:09.652 --> 07:37.583
maybe its focus has been more engineering and 
agriculture as opposed to math, political

07:09.652 --> 07:37.583
science, psychology or other things that other 
universities are known for but I think Aggies have

07:09.652 --> 07:37.583
done well representing themselves and competing 
all over the world and I don't think A&M then or now

07:38.052 --> 07:53.597
has anything to apologize for and I think it's 
always great to want to be a little bit better and to

07:38.052 --> 07:53.597
get your reputation well known nationwide but I 
never I never had any ideas that Aggies were low

07:54.843 --> 08:02.612
class or just farmers or hick hillbillies. I 
always thought that was, I mean, there were. There

08:05.735 --> 08:08.859
probably always will be some in that category. And 
if you're looking to stereotype, you can always

08:08.879 --> 08:13.804
find some examples to support that. As far as you 
knew in the student body when you were here,

08:13.984 --> 08:24.276
geographically, were they from small towns, 
country, big cities, or what?

08:27.935 --> 08:52.520
You probably already know the answer to this, but I 
would say in the late 50s, early 60s,

08:27.935 --> 08:52.520
I would guess maybe 55, 45, maybe 60, 40 that they 
were from rural, small, medium-sized towns with

08:27.935 --> 08:52.520
the minority being from larger cities. I think 
that probably has evolved. It's probably closer

08:55.343 --> 08:56.524
to 50-50 or maybe 45-55 the other way where more 
from the larger size cities but I don't know you

08:57.297 --> 09:09.869
probably have a better answer on that than I do. Was 
everybody accepted? Did it matter where you were

09:11.711 --> 09:12.872
from? What your dad did for a living? Not as long as 
you behaved yourself and made an effort to join in

09:15.555 --> 09:20.179
and mix with the group. Now if you were standoffish 
or if you felt elite and holier than thou you

09:26.828 --> 09:39.546
wouldn't fit in very well or if you were so shy and 
introverted that you wouldn't participate you

09:26.828 --> 09:39.546
know but it just what it was your own attitude that 
made the difference. Describe the religious

09:40.167 --> 09:46.896
activities in those days particularly describe 
the Baptist Student Union. Where did it meet and

09:47.095 --> 09:48.937
how often? Baptist Student Union was at Northgate 
on the main street. What's the street? It runs by

09:55.126 --> 09:59.091
the post office and runs by Hollick's and down 
there. The First Baptist Church was on the

10:00.393 --> 10:07.222
right-hand side as you go north, and the Baptist 
Student Union was right across the street. I'd

10:08.364 --> 10:14.672
usually go over there maybe one or two nights a 
week. week for an hour or two for you know

10:15.327 --> 10:37.419
fellowship and maybe Bible study maybe a 
motivational speaker or something and I was

10:15.327 --> 10:37.419
usually over there at

10:15.327 --> 10:37.419
the church usually on Sunday mornings and a lot of 
times on Sunday evenings. Was there a scheduled

10:37.880 --> 10:42.567
Sunday evening BSU event? Usually those were, I'm 
trying to remember whether that was

10:43.525 --> 10:50.640
church-related, a training union. Baptists 
usually have both the morning Sunday school and a

10:51.181 --> 11:02.125
training union Bible studies in the evening, and a 
lot of times they'll have a Bible study on

10:51.181 --> 11:02.125
Wednesday evenings, and then either a prayer 
meeting or or a choir practice if you're in the

11:02.678 --> 11:06.401
choir. And I did sing in the choir at the church. And 
right now it's kind of a blur as to what was

11:12.286 --> 11:17.671
happening at the church and what was over across 
the street at the BSU. It seemed like the BSU was

11:17.691 --> 11:21.774
more weeknight activity. There might have been 
sometimes a Sunday evening activity over there.

11:28.300 --> 11:32.263
But I remember signing up for a there was actually a 
credit course in I can't remember if it was the

11:34.893 --> 12:00.951
Bible or comparative religion and Prof Smith was 
the one who taught that taught it right there at the

11:34.893 --> 12:00.951
BSU but it was sanctioned for credit but you didn't 
have to pay any tuition for it but you did have to

11:34.893 --> 12:00.951
meet you had to show up you had to take course to pass 
the test and everything but and I did take I believe

11:34.893 --> 12:00.951
I took because I'd have to look on my transcript and 
see. I was under the impression that it was for

12:03.643 --> 12:05.626
credit. I'd have to look on my transcript to see if 
it was recognized by A&M. I think it was. Well, it

12:12.957 --> 12:14.360
was. Yeah, okay. All right, let's shift to 
athletics. Describe a typical home games

12:19.668 --> 12:27.360
Saturday, football Saturday. What time did you 
guys get up and get moving and so forth? What was it?

12:35.252 --> 12:41.663
I just remembered that home games were very, there 
was a lot of activity around. We did, even the days

12:41.683 --> 12:48.454
leading up to it, there were yell practices. We did 
the banner in the Grove. It was in the Grove. I

12:53.384 --> 12:57.028
thought at that point it always had been and always 
would be. I mean, the Grove was one of the

12:57.088 --> 13:01.274
traditions. And when I got back, came back to work 
here at A&M in early 91, I was kind of disappointed

13:01.294 --> 13:13.089
to see that the Grove had kind of passed into 
oblivion. As a matter of fact, is it still there? I

13:14.671 --> 13:16.954
believe it's still there, but it's not used very 
much. I don't think it's used much at all. So, but

13:18.758 --> 13:41.760
the other activities, the big canvas signs that 
hang from the dorm, the little caricatures and

13:18.758 --> 13:41.760
cartoons, the spirit signs, I remember having 
those laid out in one of our, well the only meeting

13:18.758 --> 13:41.760
room in the dorm. In fact, it wasn't even big enough 
to hold the whole sign spread out. you had to work on

13:47.564 --> 14:14.145
it in sections and some of the guys that were in 
architecture or might have had a natural artistic

13:47.564 --> 14:14.145
flair knew how to proportion these things so that 
they'd come out looking readable and legible and

13:47.564 --> 14:14.145
funny when you hung them on the dorm but that 
usually took several hours I remember working a

14:14.345 --> 14:27.698
little bit on one of those, but I was not that 
artistically inclined, and had other things that

14:14.345 --> 14:27.698
I had to do at the MSC, so I didn't work on those very 
much, but I know my classmates did, spent a lot of

14:14.345 --> 14:27.698
time on those. Where did you and your buddies at the 
games, where did y'all stand?

14:36.486 --> 14:40.470
On the east side, kind of probably right about end 
of the end zone line in the horseshoe and

14:40.872 --> 14:56.130
just the traditions of the 12th man and standing 
during the game and all that. I don't remember much

14:56.150 --> 15:03.679
being unusual or unique about that other than 
what's typical of Aggie lore. Do you remember any

15:04.580 --> 15:09.546
pranks or good bull during a football game or a 
football season? you and your buddies?

15:18.049 --> 15:27.653
I don't remember whether any of this happened 
during my four years or whether this was just

15:18.049 --> 15:27.653
hearsay from previous or past years but You know, 
things like stealing Bevo or stealing the Baylor

15:28.257 --> 15:34.826
Bear or Mustangs. I was not involved in any of that, 
and I heard a lot of war stories, and I didn't know if

15:34.907 --> 15:47.124
that was old eggs trying to incite the new eggs to 
new exploits or if that was something that had been

15:34.907 --> 15:47.124
done fairly recently. Looking back on it now, I 
can't remember whether any of those were really

15:47.224 --> 15:53.193
noteworthy during my tenure there or not. Did you 
ever help steal a footlocker? on a senior's

15:56.658 --> 15:58.720
footlocker. No, I didn't. And yours didn't get 
stolen. No. Any favorite football game memories?

16:08.591 --> 16:09.272
You remember any?

16:12.395 --> 16:24.488
Well, I do remember when we played University of 
Texas, I believe that was in November of 62,

16:12.395 --> 16:24.488
because Jim Keller was the quarterback. and there 
was a controversial play in the end zone that the

16:24.957 --> 16:53.597
call didn't go for A&M and Texas won the game as a 
result of it and I remember us being really

16:24.957 --> 16:53.597
irritated about that and as I recall I don't 
remember if television was widespread at that

16:24.957 --> 16:53.597
time or not or if it was still photos or something 
but the after the game evidence indicated that

16:53.982 --> 16:56.125
that call should have gone for A&M, and it didn't. 
But it's one of those things. I'm not saying the

16:58.007 --> 16:59.989
refs threw it. It was just a tough close call, and it 
went the wrong way. As far as you knew, did athletes

17:04.995 --> 17:08.619
go to class in those days? As far as I know, because I 
had some classes with some of them. I don't know if

17:12.664 --> 17:18.691
they went regularly, or if they were cut a lot, or if 
they were tutored a lot. I don't really know that

17:18.991 --> 17:22.015
much about how things went then. I was kind of busy 
with my own career and with the MSC. My sophomore

17:28.591 --> 17:39.563
year, sometime during the middle of the year, the 
chairman of the Great Issues Committee for some

17:28.591 --> 17:39.563
reason either resigned or left or dropped out or 
something. So I became committee chairman for

17:40.023 --> 17:44.268
Great Issues as a sophomore. And then that spring, 
When the selections came up for the officers for

17:49.754 --> 17:59.192
the next year, I was elected to be vice president of 
the MSC Council and Directorate. And so in

18:00.334 --> 18:13.078
September of 61,

18:00.334 --> 18:13.078
when they had the president's reception for the 
freshmen, I was, as the vice president of the MSC

18:14.240 --> 18:32.879
Council and Directorate, I was standing there 
with Dean and Mrs. Hannigan, and my predecessor,

18:14.240 --> 18:32.879
Mike Schneider, was standing there with 
President and Mrs. Rutter as hundreds, if not

18:14.240 --> 18:32.879
thousands, of freshmen filed through the MSC. And 
I can remember Mrs. Rutter telling us during a

18:32.899 --> 18:41.327
break and sitting there, and she was always a 
charming and gracious lady, she said, She said,

18:41.662 --> 18:49.231
you know, I love these things, but man, I love to sit 
down and get off my feet for a few minutes. What was

18:49.411 --> 18:51.514
your impression of Earl Rudder? I

18:53.716 --> 19:04.269
was always very much impressed with him, not just 
because of his record, because I really didn't

18:53.716 --> 19:04.269
know that much about his record. I knew he'd been 
with the Rangers and had led them up the cliffs of

19:08.729 --> 19:19.768
Pointe d'Hoc, and

19:08.729 --> 19:19.768
I knew he was a war hero and had done that as a 
lieutenant colonel. and then he had subsequently

19:19.951 --> 19:41.638
come back and I think he'd been a football coach and 
a mayor and out in Brady and then was elected to the

19:19.951 --> 19:41.638
or appointed to Texas Land Board Land 
Commissioner Land Commissioner and had cleaned

19:19.951 --> 19:41.638
up a pretty messy situation politically And I knew 
that vaguely. I knew more about it and had that

19:44.989 --> 19:57.322
reinforced in later years, but I knew a little bit 
about his background, and I knew he was a strong

19:44.989 --> 19:57.322
leader, no-nonsense type guy. And

19:57.342 --> 20:10.056
he and Mrs. Rutter used to host fireside chats over 
at their home, the big wooden house that burned in

19:57.342 --> 20:10.056
December of 63. In fact, I was over at the MSC and 
having lunch, and as we came out, we looked up, we

20:11.032 --> 20:23.226
could see the smoke, and were able to walk over 
there and saw that fire in progress. But back in 61

20:23.306 --> 20:37.562
and 62, when I was vice president and then later 
president of the MSC Council and Directorate, I

20:23.306 --> 20:37.562
was one of the student leaders invited over, I 
would say maybe once or twice a semester, to their

20:38.757 --> 20:47.839
home or it might be on call if there was some issue or 
some incident that had happened that he wanted to,

20:38.757 --> 20:47.839
you know, test the water, see what was happening, 
or maybe ask for our help in getting things calmed

20:48.798 --> 20:55.707
down. We'd go over there, and Mrs. Rutter always 
served punch or tea, or not tea unless it was iced

20:56.568 --> 21:08.042
tea, but soft drinks and cookies. She always had 
homemade cookies. And we would talk in exchange,

21:10.165 --> 21:17.995
and just being able to express an opinion or to 
raise an issue I thought was... was good and I

21:19.308 --> 21:24.536
always thought he was eminently reasonable. I was 
kind of on the fence when the decisions came and

21:25.257 --> 21:45.788
that was during my tenure regarding both the 
non-compulsory membership in the cadet corps

21:25.257 --> 21:45.788
even for the first two years and introducing women 
to the campus and I could see arguments pro and con

21:47.455 --> 21:53.584
on both sides, so I was kind of on the fence. Also the 
name change came up during that time. That was a lot

21:55.947 --> 21:59.392
of pivotal things happening in those years. And of 
course I was even aware at that time, even though I

22:00.173 --> 22:09.567
never participated with it, of the, I believe that 
particular group was called, was it called the

22:00.173 --> 22:09.567
Century Council? The Century Study. The Century 
Study. And I think the participants in that,

22:13.645 --> 22:18.991
sometimes maybe informally, were referred to as 
the Century Council. And

22:19.932 --> 22:30.763
they were looking at what do we want A&M to be in 
1976, which was the 100th anniversary. And that

22:30.923 --> 22:33.806
was just less than a decade away. It was time to plan 
ahead for that. And so... Sometimes when people

22:41.641 --> 22:46.428
were over there, I would make a comment or I would 
talk to them like John Lindsay. I ran into John

22:46.708 --> 22:54.720
Lindsay over there and people on the MSC Council, 
you know, it's made up of students, some faculty

22:46.708 --> 22:54.720
members, and some former student members. And I

22:55.661 --> 23:08.560
never made a formal presentation, never 
submitted a formal paper on anything, but I

22:55.661 --> 23:08.560
remember discussing things like that with a lot of 
different people. being in a position and being

23:09.502 --> 23:18.356
respected and trusted enough to participate in 
those kind of discussions was always very highly

23:09.502 --> 23:18.356
motivating for me. Did you have any impression of 
what Mr. Rutter's feelings were about those

23:18.957 --> 23:24.125
topics?

23:27.691 --> 23:31.577
I always sensed that he was neutral that was my 
feeling at the time he was probing he was he was

23:32.502 --> 23:55.270
asking people for pros and cons and yet in 
retrospect I think he must have been in favor of it

23:32.502 --> 23:55.270
because if he had been against it he could have 
squelched it just by not having it on the agenda as

23:32.502 --> 23:55.270
often as he did And I was, in a way, I was kind of 
surprised, but then it kind of all fell into place

23:56.785 --> 24:09.724
when I found out years later about his secret 
meetings with the senator from Bryan. Bill Moore.

24:10.626 --> 24:24.126
Bill Moore, where sometimes one or the other would 
call or get a call, and they would arrange a

24:10.626 --> 24:24.126
rendezvous in some dark parking lot or some dark 
alleyway where they would pull up car to car. open

24:24.730 --> 24:51.868
the window exchange information or strategy or or 
you know who's who needs to be contacted who needs

24:24.730 --> 24:51.868
to be brought online for this or that uh and and uh so 
in a way that that it doesn't surprise me but it does

24:24.730 --> 24:51.868
confirm that he was in favor of these or at least he 
was was won over I really don't know who the drivers

24:24.730 --> 24:51.868
were behind that whether it was Earl Rudder or 
whether there were other people encouraging him

24:52.642 --> 24:54.145
to do that. I kind of suspect that John Lindsay was a 
big motivator behind that. I don't know if there

25:00.456 --> 25:17.485
were others and I don't know if he felt pressured to 
go along with the other powers behind the scene or

25:00.456 --> 25:17.485
whether it was his idea and he was using the powers 
behind the scene to bring public opinion around to

25:00.456 --> 25:17.485
the point where it would be accepted or at least it 
would be neutral and leave it to his call but

25:18.038 --> 25:45.970
whoever did it however they did it it was effective 
and I think A&M is in a lot of respects is better for

25:18.038 --> 25:45.970
it in other respects I guess the argument could be 
made that even if A&M were smaller more focused

25:18.038 --> 25:45.970
more concentrated on engineering agriculture 
and training military officers it still could be

25:46.456 --> 25:49.259
an important force. Describe the role of the MSC 
Council President during that era. What was the

25:55.225 --> 25:58.248
task of that slot?

26:06.176 --> 26:14.004
I'm not sure how much real leadership and 
influence you had. It was more like you were

26:18.940 --> 26:25.628
helping to guide a lot of folks who were already 
self-motivated. You were helping, you know,

26:27.691 --> 26:43.851
Wayne Stark implement all of the activities of the 
MSC, and obviously it's an important, it's a very

26:27.691 --> 26:43.851
important function to be the living room of the 
campus, to have nice places for you to bring

26:27.691 --> 26:43.851
visitors, visit with your parents and to have 
extracurricular activities. And you were a

26:49.906 --> 26:51.848
coordinator. You were a coordinator. You were a 
facilitator. You did budgeting. You did

26:56.675 --> 26:57.496
selection. I think the most important thing was 
selecting the leadership for the next generation

26:58.077 --> 27:08.691
and finding people who were qualified 
self-starting, self-motivated, because you

27:08.772 --> 27:24.537
really didn't have a lot of power to coerce or to 
force somebody to do something that they didn't

27:08.772 --> 27:24.537
want to do or weren't willing to do, but

27:25.917 --> 27:55.080
you could if you knew someone was motivated and 
maybe were getting a little bit careless or maybe

27:25.917 --> 27:55.080
were being distracted by girlfriends or academic 
problems or core problems or something sometimes

27:25.917 --> 27:55.080
you could maybe help chat with them and encourage 
them or maybe get them to a counselor who had the

27:25.917 --> 27:55.080
authority to do something I don't remember any 
really big problems except for some my junior year

27:55.347 --> 28:18.233
there were some problems with the student senate 
apparently there had been there were some the

27:55.347 --> 28:18.233
student senate president I guess that was also 
called the student body president had offices

27:55.347 --> 28:18.233
over in the YMCA and student government was kept 
separate from the student union, which was the MSC

28:18.415 --> 28:21.300
activities. And I think Wayne had wanted it that 
way. I think he had probably seen enough in other

28:25.386 --> 28:35.362
campuses where student government and student 
union could become rivals, especially if they

28:25.386 --> 28:35.362
were two strong personalities. And he just 
preferred that they be kept separate. but the

28:41.956 --> 29:02.020
student senate, I believe Malcolm Hall was one of 
the, well he was the student body president my

28:41.956 --> 29:02.020
junior year and so he presided over the student 
senate and I remember one of their agenda items was

28:41.956 --> 29:02.020
to get space to move over to the MSC. They wanted to 
be in the MSC because I think they were I think they

29:06.340 --> 29:13.187
were feeling like second-class citizens, and 
they thought the student body president should be

29:06.340 --> 29:13.187
number one and have a place of prominence. And they 
may be right. I don't know. I tried not to take a

29:15.189 --> 29:21.115
position one way or the other because I knew Mr. 
Stark was not in favor of that. What were some, in

29:21.816 --> 29:35.470
the NSC task you had, what were some of your 
greatest frustration moments and positive

29:21.816 --> 29:35.470
moments?

29:36.142 --> 29:39.085
Okay, one incident I remember. It was a little bit 
of frustration, anxiety, and then relief.

29:48.614 --> 29:56.081
The SCONA, I guess this was the spring of either 60 
or 61, must have been 61, spring of 61.

29:59.224 --> 30:03.688
For the first time, a black delegate was invited to 
SCONA. By mistake. And it may have been a mistake,

30:06.061 --> 30:08.786
but... They invited Florida A&M not realizing it 
was a black school. Well, no, this guy was, that may

30:12.051 --> 30:19.684
have happened in a subsequent year, but this guy 
was from Texas A&I. They invited Texas A&I and they

30:20.105 --> 30:30.482
selected a black delegate or maybe had a black 
delegate volunteer and didn't feel like they were

30:20.105 --> 30:30.482
in a position to veto it. And so Vance Shaw, I 
believe from Belton or Temple, somewhere over in

30:30.698 --> 30:40.266
Central Texas, was the student who was going to be 
coming up. And in fact, that occasioned one of my

30:40.546 --> 30:44.570
visits to the Green Couch. The first one I 
mentioned was when we got Dr. Paul Seiple for great

30:44.910 --> 30:49.954
issues. But on this one, Mr. Stark had me in there. I 
was not only vice president there. I was not the

30:56.240 --> 30:57.020
only one. There were several of us in there, but 
there was...

31:01.630 --> 31:10.089
The vice president of the MSC is ex officio a member 
of the Student Senate and a member of the Executive

31:01.630 --> 31:10.089
Committee of SCONA. And so we had some folks in 
there brainstorming about how to...
