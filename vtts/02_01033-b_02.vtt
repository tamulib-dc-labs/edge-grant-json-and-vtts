WEBVTT

00:03.777 --> 00:05.239
They took on a lot of different subjects. They were 
truthful and sincere about it. They didn't follow

00:09.345 --> 00:24.526
journalistic rules,

00:09.345 --> 00:24.526
which tries to say there's such a thing as 
objectivity, which if you get out and analyze

00:09.345 --> 00:24.526
what's objective and what's subjective, you're 
going to run into major problems. Everybody that

00:24.847 --> 00:32.097
writes something is making decisions about 
what's in there and what's not in there and what

00:24.847 --> 00:32.097
words are used. and how you string those together, 
what questions you ask, what questions you don't

00:33.325 --> 00:40.054
ask. So they let people write, you know, this is 
what I believe, this is what I see, and it had a big

00:41.997 --> 00:54.193
impact, not only on just the activist community 
and helped to build resistance, but it had an

00:41.997 --> 00:54.193
impact on the media at that time. And that leads me 
to another thing that we did together, a bunch of

00:56.216 --> 01:01.223
them, We held media conferences, had three of them 
in Texas, and I think this is reported in the

01:01.861 --> 01:09.248
Observer. I'm not sure. We had one in Austin, the 
first one. We had one in Dallas, and we had one in

01:12.752 --> 01:15.354
Houston. The basic, the original idea came from 
Alice Embree, the woman I was telling you about a

01:15.374 --> 01:19.438
minute ago. She was one of the original people that 
worked on the RAG, helped put it together. She's

01:22.521 --> 01:27.126
also one of the people who was active in National 
SDS, went to New York City early, on she really knew

01:27.848 --> 01:40.744
a lot understands a lot still does very intense 
wonderful person and she had this idea that we

01:27.848 --> 01:40.744
could reach a lot of these people in the media these 
reporters don't like for a goddamn editor or

01:41.011 --> 01:47.881
publisher to say, you can't do this, don't do this, 
write this, don't write that. It makes horrors out

01:47.921 --> 01:49.523
of piss. Who the hell have I? I can't tell the truth. 
And of course, there are the ones who still do that

01:53.408 --> 02:03.002
write a lot of the stories or feed a lot of the 
stories to the observer and other folks where they

01:53.408 --> 02:03.002
cannot have their name attached to it because they 
lose their job. At any rate, Alice's idea was that

02:03.978 --> 02:18.883
we can reach a lot of these media people, and we'll 
get some better stories, and we'll get some more

02:03.978 --> 02:18.883
information from within, if we do reach them, and 
not in any manipulative way. In other words, make

02:18.903 --> 02:20.325
all of this open. What we're trying to do is open up a 
dialogue between reporters and TV people and

02:20.465 --> 02:26.475
radio people and the new left. So we had these new 
left media comments. I did the advance work on that

02:28.933 --> 02:30.475
again. She knew a good many of the media people and I 
did too because I'd worked in Texas Liberal

02:30.835 --> 02:46.071
Democratic Party politics and I knew how to get 
around all the stations and newspapers and hand

02:30.835 --> 02:46.071
out press releases and bullshit and drink 
martinis and all that crap. And we had a good

02:46.091 --> 02:48.233
conference. We got a lot of young media people.

02:54.380 --> 02:54.640
And In Dallas, I don't know how many we had. I guess 
we probably ended up with 30 or 40. We had people

03:02.102 --> 03:09.551
there from the Dallas Morning News, the Dallas 
Times, Arrow, the major TV stations. Of course,

03:09.571 --> 03:13.416
the underground media, I forgot the name of that 
one. There was a good underground paper up there.

03:16.279 --> 03:20.044
And these weren't folks just there to rat on us to 
their owners. Well, there were some of those, but a

03:20.544 --> 03:25.470
lot of very sincere young people in the media. And 
it worked well. I mean, they found out, people

03:28.164 --> 03:40.638
always find out when they get out of their little 
isolation boxes that there are a lot of other

03:28.164 --> 03:40.638
people that are worried about the same things 
they're worried about and have some of the same

03:28.164 --> 03:40.638
problems. And that it is possible to do a few 
things, and sometimes it's possible to do a whole

03:42.100 --> 03:48.507
lot, but you've got to do them together. At any 
rate, all of that dynamic occurred because they

03:48.527 --> 03:54.394
told each other horror stories about, you know, 
You know, when such and such story came out, well,

03:54.796 --> 03:58.099
here's what really happened. This is why I 
couldn't do this. And they said, well, listen to

03:59.401 --> 04:01.623
this. And God damn, if the American people as a 
whole could have heard all of that stuff on TV, it

04:01.643 --> 04:07.529
would have been great. The problem always is 
reaching folks so that they can get information.

04:14.817 --> 04:16.098
We did that one in Dallas. We did one in Houston. We 
did one here. A lot of those people, it changed

04:18.180 --> 04:20.683
their lives, too. I know here locally, there were 
two women. There were reporters on the American

04:23.382 --> 04:32.673
station, Austin American, who quit. Not 
immediately thereafter, but in recent years,

04:32.693 --> 04:41.803
said that those media conferences had an impact on 
what they decided to do with their lives. They

04:41.864 --> 04:49.132
decided they weren't gonna continue writing the 
same old shit and doing the same old thing.

04:49.252 --> 04:52.596
Even though one of them is now She's a poet and a 
writer. Fiction. Short story.

05:00.871 --> 05:01.231
Okay. Tonight, you know, we're talking about 
Rubin and Hoffman.

05:12.367 --> 05:18.075
Two people who know a whole lot about the media. And 
really changed a lot of things as far as is the way

05:23.120 --> 05:28.628
the media looks at things now, because they 
manipulated the hell out of the media. They pulled

05:29.249 --> 05:31.272
a lot of good theater. I mean, they've dramatized 
things where then one TV station would have to

05:31.553 --> 05:37.382
carry it, because if they didn't, another one 
would. And first thing you know, demonstrations

05:37.422 --> 05:50.562
and a whole lot of the different activities were 
getting coverage just because the nature of the

05:37.422 --> 05:50.562
competition between some of the capitalists They 
had the same basic principles, but they felt like

05:50.828 --> 05:54.412
they had to carry this stuff. So they opened 
themselves up to being manipulated. And I guess

05:59.198 --> 06:07.568
you heard about the one where Abbie Hoffman went 
into the Wall Street exchange and threw dollar

05:59.198 --> 06:07.568
bills all over the floor of the stock exchange that 
day. They had all those fucking clerks and guys

06:08.228 --> 06:13.615
scrambling around on the floor picking up dollar 
bills. Which, if you think about it, there are

06:14.456 --> 06:18.861
these young clerk guys out of Harvard and Yale 
trying to climb the squirrel cage, get up the

06:20.360 --> 06:27.246
ladder, and button boys for million-dollar 
purchases. But there comes a dollar bill down on

06:27.266 --> 06:31.750
the floor, and there they are scrambling after. At 
any rate, it showed some of the contradictions of

06:31.770 --> 06:35.853
what was going on. The

06:36.654 --> 06:42.519
media, a lot of them were very sympathetic. You 
know the chuck wagon case?

06:48.223 --> 06:50.265
Long times past, I wouldn't even talk about this. I 
mean, all the legal ramifications yet is, is,

06:50.853 --> 06:58.179
uh, is over.

07:02.103 --> 07:20.218
Uh, that TV people there, they were there that day 
of the demonstration, got all kinds of footage and

07:02.103 --> 07:20.218
after

07:02.103 --> 07:20.218
the arrest and after the, It became clear that the 
establishment here in Austin was going to try to

07:20.789 --> 07:26.737
make felony cases out of this, which is 
ridiculous. They were trying to send people to

07:27.618 --> 07:35.149
prison

07:27.618 --> 07:35.149
for relatively minor free speech activities. 
What they did was contact

07:37.152 --> 07:42.960
us individually and surreptitiously. Thank you. 
And there's two of them. They made it possible. I

07:50.658 --> 07:52.940
was in charge of collecting the evidence. And we 
had to have good security on that because some

07:53.801 --> 07:58.646
evidence is helpful, some evidence is harmful. 
And it's not the defense's responsibility on the

07:59.988 --> 08:05.814
so-called American system to make the case for the 
prosecution. So I'm under no responsibility to

08:06.715 --> 08:10.519
help the state make a case. The contrary is not true 
about the state, by the way. They're supposed to

08:12.721 --> 08:18.167
open up and disclose what they have, which is what 
happened in this Hurricane Carter case. You know

08:18.991 --> 08:20.413
about that? This guy just got out of prison. It's 
been 19 years. Bob Dylan wrote the song about him.

08:26.199 --> 08:33.127
Well, what happened in that case, the prosecution 
did not make a lot of information available that

08:26.199 --> 08:33.127
would have been helpful to the defense in that 
case. Finally, 19 years later, a fucking judge

08:33.147 --> 08:37.612
says, no, that ain't part of our constitution. Let 
the guy out. Of course, he's 19 years late. A lot of

08:41.056 --> 08:44.120
orgasms went by, and that Ford joker's in a pen. So I 
have problems with the legal system. It doesn't

08:47.724 --> 08:48.525
work. 19 years, and I'm sorry I made a mistake. At 
any rate, those media people, what they did,

08:51.933 --> 08:58.362
several of them contacted me. I had a good 
reputation, still do, at least in that respect.

09:06.813 --> 09:11.239
I've been discreet and trustworthy, and made that 
footage available. us to look at for two reasons.

09:17.093 --> 09:18.715
One, to know what the prosecution had. And then 
some of it was for us to decide whether or not we

09:19.516 --> 09:26.985
wanted the prosecution to have it. And of course, 
we made that decision. And they helped.

09:35.396 --> 09:40.062
And that's within, in fact, Lady Bird's TV 
station. And that's a TV reporter. Fuck you. And

09:43.046 --> 09:45.268
they hated the man that was in Lady Bird. And they 
hated the war. But, you know, what can they do about

09:46.549 --> 09:47.750
it? Well, one of them helped us a lot because some 
footage got destroyed that wouldn't have helped

09:47.790 --> 09:54.277
at all. And plus, we got to see everything that the 
district attorney was going to be able to use. The

09:59.902 --> 10:02.225
same way with still photographs. A lot of people 
always take pictures of major demonstrations, of

10:02.245 --> 10:06.869
course. As you'll learn if you're active, a whole 
lot of them are FBI. And if the president's around,

10:10.923 --> 10:13.246
a whole lot of them are Secret Service. But there 
are always a lot of cameras around. And so then when

10:15.689 --> 10:24.279
a legal case comes out of all that, you've got 
hundreds of photographs that you've got to try to

10:15.689 --> 10:24.279
figure out how they're going to be used. The media 
helps in that. Now, these are individual people in

10:28.584 --> 10:31.928
the media that are helping. So in a way, it's not the 
question. The question, of course, is what is

10:33.450 --> 10:38.175
media policy? How are they going to handle 
something? That's a whole different thing.

10:42.405 --> 10:43.867
They're going to be opposed to you. You're going to 
have a very difficult time. The TV, I rarely watch

10:47.432 --> 10:56.303
the TV news things except when there's something 
so burning that I have to watch it just to know if the

10:47.432 --> 10:56.303
roof's going to cave in. Because they extract one 
sentence and that's supposed to be the story. And

11:01.450 --> 11:08.419
you've got to have a lot more information than that 
to make any kind of decision.

11:11.926 --> 11:13.669
A lot of that stuff in the Middle East is that way. 
You just get the tip of the iceberg. The way they

11:17.074 --> 11:23.864
carried that story about when the United States 
hijacked an Egyptian plane, like in Crime Against

11:17.074 --> 11:23.864
Humanity. I mean, Reagan and the so-called big 
boys, they decided, screw the law, international

11:24.465 --> 11:30.293
law. This Egyptian airline plane has got 
something we want. We're going to take it and put it

11:34.379 --> 11:36.803
over here and get what we want. Of course, the media 
didn't care that way. I mean, what they cared was

11:38.859 --> 11:41.824
getting the bad boy. The hell with international 
law. And the media still hasn't talked about it in

11:44.969 --> 11:51.479
truthful terms.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.405
And that's something that's scary.

11:57.087 --> 12:06.081
If we're not careful, American people may get so 
jaded and so cynical about what's permissible and

11:57.087 --> 12:06.081
what isn't that we'll lose our sense of outrage. 
And if we lose that in our sense of compassion,

12:06.753 --> 12:13.039
we're in real problems as humanity. How

12:13.079 --> 12:19.706
did you drop out of the establishment in the 
mid-60s? I mean, the establishment as in the

12:19.726 --> 12:23.750
Democratic Party, per se. Well,

12:24.851 --> 12:35.241
by then, I think I'd learned from the civil rights 
movement that the basic changes were not going to

12:24.851 --> 12:35.241
come through electoral politics through the 
reasoning with elected officials or just by

12:36.166 --> 12:43.237
registering people and getting out the vote. If 
you know what the candidate selection process is,

12:43.898 --> 12:53.051
how a person gets to be a candidate, what's 
required, I've gone through that with

12:43.898 --> 12:53.051
candidates. I've traveled all over this state for 
two months with that guy who ran for governor,

12:53.392 --> 13:05.650
going to all the towns and cities of any size, 
talking to so-called opinion-maker rich folks.

13:06.085 --> 13:09.690
Folks, you have to line up to try to get a candidacy 
off the ground. That process, along with how

13:11.913 --> 13:30.861
election campaigns are conducted, the media, the 
access to the media, particularly TV in the last 20

13:11.913 --> 13:30.861
years, 30 years, the print media, how it's 
manipulated, what its interests are, what it will

13:11.913 --> 13:30.861
permit and not permit, if you know all that stuff, 
then which I was beginning to get very acute at in

13:31.482 --> 13:37.491
the 1963 and 64 Corps. We'd been taking licks from 
Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and a whole bunch

13:37.991 --> 13:41.697
of folks. And I was beginning to know when somebody 
was hitting me in the head. And I saw that, like

13:47.144 --> 13:54.996
Lyndon said, I mean, he's very honest on this one 
subject anyway, the squeaky wheel gets the

13:47.144 --> 13:54.996
grease. Well, what he's saying is if you raise 
enough hell and put enough pressure on it, to those

14:00.659 --> 14:09.848
things that don't basically change the system, 
you may get some relief, which is what happened to

14:00.659 --> 14:09.848
the Civil Rights Movement. We got some relief. But 
that was by massive pressure, and it was 1964 that I

14:11.650 --> 14:17.136
said, fuck it. Electro-politics will never work. 
We're never going to get basic change. We're never

14:20.119 --> 14:28.067
going to have a society that feeds and clothes and 
works on loving relationships between people as

14:20.119 --> 14:28.067
long as we have The property system and the legal 
electoral system that we've got now, we cannot

14:29.060 --> 14:37.512
change it from within. Of course, that was an 
ongoing debate for years about whether you had to

14:37.532 --> 14:42.980
work from within or without. You can get some 
changes from within. The basic ones, you cannot.

14:48.328 --> 14:50.792
The big rich are not going to share the wealth. 
There ain't no way. You've got to take it away from

14:52.154 --> 14:53.476
them. Mal's right about that. how you do that. I 
don't want to do it with a gun, but probably at some

14:56.945 --> 15:13.751
point, if we're so fortunate as to be able to start 
changing property and human relationships,

14:56.945 --> 15:13.751
there will be a major confrontation between the 
big rich and the rest of us. So that's why I quit. The

15:15.854 --> 15:18.017
traditional, you know, I realized that The basic 
change I was interested in, everybody having

15:18.908 --> 15:30.674
enough to eat, enough clothing, and enough 
liberty and freedom and loving relationships,

15:18.908 --> 15:30.674
was not going to be addressed by the American 
system. And it didn't. It still isn't. You know,

15:34.022 --> 15:36.968
something that's real fascinating to me is this 
year, Have you noticed how many of these big

15:37.319 --> 15:46.855
benefits, musical benefits, the contradiction 
between them and what Reagan and the

15:37.319 --> 15:46.855
establishment's putting out is just fantastic. 
They put together that Aid for Africa thing. And

15:49.619 --> 15:58.334
here's the fucking big boys who've got their 
wealth rolling in and out of Africa, saying,

15:49.619 --> 15:58.334
everything's a fucking door over, just leave it 
alone, be quiet, boys. And of course, the

15:58.354 --> 16:02.280
musicians and all these folks get it together, a 
big event. And then what happens? Willie Nelson

16:03.882 --> 16:05.565
and the others farm aid. Now, what Reagan and 
everybody's saying, farmers, that's tough.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.193
You're just a little old bitty farmer. I'm sorry, 
son, you lose. Del Monte, that's okay. But

16:13.399 --> 16:15.703
American agriculture is okay. And then Willie 
Nelson and them, big problem. We've got to have a

16:18.167 --> 16:21.153
big concert and benefit for the farmers. And down 
in New Orleans, the jazz and blues people, they're

16:21.173 --> 16:25.180
having a big one. for the poor people in New 
Orleans. And of course Reagan said, there ain't no

16:28.115 --> 16:31.680
politics, blah, blah, blah. And then they're 
doing the same thing out in California about the

16:31.700 --> 16:37.348
AIDS sign. Because the administration doesn't 
want to admit that we've got a major, which that's a

16:37.368 --> 16:45.860
tragic social major problem we've got occurring, 
is AIDS, and that's terrifying. If you think about

16:46.682 --> 16:50.527
it, I'm not talking about just the gay community, 
I'm talking about everybody. We better lick that

16:50.547 --> 16:53.511
son of a bitch quick. And yet we're not doing it. 
applying the resources and expertise to it. But

16:58.030 --> 17:06.139
again, there's a group of people that are getting 
together who have big names, big drawing power,

16:58.030 --> 17:06.139
and saying, you're lying. There is a big problem, 
and we ain't doing nothing about it. Capitalism is

17:09.944 --> 17:13.468
not geared to taking care of certain basic 
problems. It's geared to benefit a relatively few

17:14.249 --> 17:19.716
people. That's my speech for the day. And, of 
course, I would like to say that the ongoing

17:24.138 --> 17:33.747
dilemma for me, as it is for a whole lot of folks, is 
what to do with my life. Day to day, what do I do next?

17:36.750 --> 17:37.951
I have a hard time with that. We had Emma Jo's. It was 
easier because there are a number of groups and

17:38.852 --> 17:45.859
organizations and activities around town, and we 
could plug into them. We could have benefits for

17:45.899 --> 17:47.060
them. We could give them a forum. We could 
publicize a number of things we could do that were

17:48.241 --> 17:54.027
useful but we don't have that place anymore. And 
you have

17:57.143 --> 18:01.388
to make a living. You have to come up with enough 
money to feed yourself and shelter yourself,

18:01.408 --> 18:07.295
which, by the way, is much different than the 
1960s. From about 1964 to 1968,

18:08.256 --> 18:22.292
I lived on what they called the couch circuit back 
in those days, which means I lived everywhere with

18:08.256 --> 18:22.292
friends in the living room or the couch on the 
floor. And then I had a relationship with a dear

18:23.065 --> 18:29.615
woman, a lover for about five or six years. And then 
that broke up, and again I was on the couch for a year

18:30.056 --> 18:34.523
and a half. That's when there was heavy political 
activity going on. It was a widespread sense of

18:37.508 --> 18:39.752
community. In other words, people didn't mind as 
much. We were real honest about it. You know,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.302
you're staying too long, Mark. You've been here a 
week. getting on my nerves, or my larder's low and I

18:49.930 --> 18:54.655
can't support you, you better find some other 
place to go. But we were happy to have you come back

18:55.376 --> 18:58.380
again some other time. So there was a community of 
interest which doesn't exist now. But it's very

19:03.585 --> 19:10.894
difficult, I think, now to find those things that 
you can work on that make a real difference. We've

19:10.914 --> 19:18.182
got several here in Austin, there's groups 
working on that refugee problem out of South and

19:10.914 --> 19:18.182
Central America. the anti-nuclear group, the 
Peace and Justice Coalition has been here. We have

19:25.187 --> 19:47.521
some Chicano groups that do some good things, and 
some of the student groups, the PLO, not PLO,

19:25.187 --> 19:47.521
Palestinian student groups try to get a lot of 
information out about what's going on in the

19:25.187 --> 19:47.521
Mideast with Israel. But what I... What I think is 
that there are a whole lot of people like me who have

19:49.195 --> 19:56.206
basically the same convictions. A lot of new 
people, but certainly a lot of people older that

19:56.226 --> 20:01.614
went through some of the same experiences I did. 
That come the time, if Reagan tries to invade

20:01.634 --> 20:12.411
Nicaragua or the Mideast, do something totally 
outrageous. Nothing. I'm not saying a thing like

20:14.120 --> 20:17.465
Renato, which is going to stomp it or something. 
What a joke that was. But if he tries to do something

20:19.729 --> 20:29.504
outrageous, then there will be large numbers of 
people, a lot of Vietnam vets, that will come

20:19.729 --> 20:29.504
unglued, that will get with young people in a 
hurry. And young people ain't going to want to go

20:29.944 --> 20:37.596
fighting in any banana republic about who gets the 
big money. And we were talking about the military

20:39.652 --> 20:42.956
and what's the else they understood when they lost 
the military. Now they've got a pretty much

20:42.996 --> 20:46.319
mercenary military. And it's heavy black in 
Chicano because those are the poorest categories

20:46.339 --> 20:58.252
of groups that don't have more opportunities 
outside the military, so it's heavy black in

20:46.339 --> 20:58.252
Chicano inside. Well, there's one thing that I 
think the big boys learned in Vietnam. is that

21:03.749 --> 21:09.058
people of color just ain't too happy about being 
sent by the white man to go kill some more people of

21:03.749 --> 21:09.058
color. So if they try to send them to Nicaragua or 
Salvador, they may have some of the same problems

21:09.459 --> 21:15.609
they had in Vietnam. White officers getting their 
ass shot. By black and Chicano enlisted. Is

21:25.703 --> 21:32.478
there anything else you wanted to go into? No, as 
you can tell, you've got me all excited. I've been

21:37.610 --> 21:39.775
rattling for three or four hours. But I've enjoyed 
it. I hope it'll be helpful.

21:55.792 --> 22:00.656
You want some of the rag people that... Rag people,

works for the city. He's Chilean. Alice knows a

23:01.831 --> 23:03.113
whole lot about Chile. She spent a whole lot of time 
in Chile. Alice Embry would be a good person to talk

23:06.978 --> 23:12.706
to because she's active in the rag here locally. 
She knows a good bit about the rap, which is a very

23:12.806 --> 23:17.993

the women's movement, knows a whole lot about

23:18.648 --> 23:32.533

24:45.858 --> 24:58.571

P-A-R-D-U-N, I think he's somewhere in the

24:45.858 --> 24:58.571
Midwest, one of the smaller farming communities, 
but I'm not sure. I know he lived in a commune in

24:58.671 --> 25:01.434
Arkansas for a couple of years. A man who is here 
locally, who's quite articulate and very

25:02.255 --> 25:12.405

started the rat in New York City, and is now

movement law office and with the women's 
movement. active in an A&M case where they forced

26:14.350 --> 26:19.016
them to recognize gay organizations. She had that 
case originally. In fact, I went down there when

26:22.441 --> 26:25.885
the initial interviews were going on. That was 
very interesting, the way they tried to shut that

26:25.905 --> 26:29.510
down. She also brought the first sex 
discrimination case against the University of

26:29.530 --> 26:38.983
Texas, representing an art professor. Very 
prominent case. At any rate, Bobby Nelson, very

26:39.964 --> 26:43.108
knowledgeable, intelligent, articulate. Okay,

26:44.843 --> 27:03.300
some of the people that I now have political 
differences with but really respect and have a lot

26:44.843 --> 27:03.300
of knowledge,

26:44.843 --> 27:03.300
they're apt to be more leery than some of us about 
talking.

York State University at Albany. Fred Cohen used 
to be the university professor of law, currently

29:26.100 --> 29:32.366
with New York State University at Buffalo, by the 
way. This is part of the purge that occurred in the

29:32.426 --> 29:42.996
early 70s when the University of Texas got rid of 
all people that left liberal persuasion.

29:43.600 --> 29:56.785

30:12.627 --> 30:27.645
20-year span.

30:28.887 --> 30:36.456
Ernie Cortez, last name, I think it's 
C-O-R-T-E-S, out of San Antonio, he's I think

30:37.111 --> 30:42.940
Terry Anderson will probably know that group he 
works with. It's Chicano issue oriented. It's a

30:44.662 --> 30:47.526
Saul Alinsky type group that I mentioned, the 
Acorn. They have a lot of affiliations with church

30:49.089 --> 30:52.314
groups and businesses. They try to get funding for 
small minority businesses.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.768

Duke faculty, history faculty, knows a lot about

31:22.752 --> 31:29.300

of the civil rights movement. An

31:36.072 --> 31:42.998
older... Oh, Glenn Scott. G-L-E-N-N-S-C-O-T-T.

31:43.859 --> 31:49.184
That's a woman. She's married, keeps her maiden 
name, and I think it's listed in the phone book.

She's been very active in media and has put 
together some, with other women, put together

31:56.210 --> 32:04.678
some films that are available about historical 
Texas women and They were organizers of various

32:04.979 --> 32:10.907
sorts, either labor organizers or Chicano 
organizers. And if he's looking for a program

32:11.728 --> 32:19.860
sometime or a class, and she's a very good speaker.

32:24.767 --> 32:29.493
Elaine, what does she call herself now? Elaine 
Brightwater. Yeah. phone book extensive

workers movement and then later with the women's

32:33.970 --> 33:00.518
community currently we helped establish and 
helps operate a birth clinic which is to help women

32:33.970 --> 33:00.518
who don't want to go to the hospital and don't have a 
lot of money. became a nurse. She went through.

33:04.050 --> 33:20.165
She's a great woman.

33:20.185 --> 33:26.871
John Muir, last name spelled M-U-I-R. Maybe he 
listed an awesome phone book. He's currently one

33:26.891 --> 33:30.775
of the key staff members with the South Texas 
Chicano-oriented legal group that he helps to

33:31.852 --> 33:41.904
raise legal support and money for the activities 
in the valley. Somebody will know the name of that

33:43.666 --> 33:45.528
organization. I don't. The Observer's got it 
listed somewhere in their table of organizations

33:46.229 --> 33:51.175
in the back. John Muir is very knowledgeable, very 
articulate.

33:58.953 --> 34:04.340
Larry Dave's, last name D-A-V-E-S, attorney, 
Tyler, Texas. He fought a courageous fight in East

34:06.824 --> 34:10.689
Texas. He finished law school and went over there. 
A lot of the black radical labor, all the unpopular

34:12.371 --> 34:24.108
stuff, as usual.

34:24.708 --> 34:25.129
Oh, look. there is an older woman a woman i guess in 
her late 60s now one of my dearest friends my oldest

34:25.379 --> 34:46.763
daughter is named after her her name is latane 
l-a-t-a-n-e lambert l-a-m-b-e-r-t active in the

34:25.379 --> 34:46.763
30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s experiencing Everything. 
She started out in theater, and she and her husband

34:48.883 --> 34:57.518
were active in organizing the pecan shellers in 
San Antonio. A great story. They got married, and

34:58.119 --> 35:02.687
their wedding, they had all strikers, their own 
strike. It was winter. Big warehouse. They all got

35:05.471 --> 35:06.473
together. Of course, they'd been living 
together, sleeping lovers for a long time, but it

35:07.820 --> 35:14.750
was decided by powers that be they ought to get 
married. It wasn't good PR as far as the Chicanos,

35:14.770 --> 35:20.559
who were very Catholic church oriented. They got 
married. He later, George Lambert, was an

35:22.282 --> 35:28.331
international representative of the 
International Ladies Vomit Workers Union. It was

35:28.351 --> 35:30.514
a very radical, dynamic type union. Anyway, on 
their wedding night, they had the strike going on,

35:30.654 --> 35:36.443
and George went out to the picket lines. And it was 
colder than hell, and so the picket people, they

35:37.098 --> 35:50.116
got a barrel, which was common, and had sand in it, 
poured gas on it, and lit a fire to warm their hands

35:37.098 --> 35:50.116
while they were on the picket line. And they 
arrested him, and she said she didn't get to fuck

35:50.557 --> 35:53.321
him for two weeks.

35:57.187 --> 35:59.109
But Latane knows a whole lot. In fact, part of her, I 
think her own papers, plus her husband, who's now

35:59.169 --> 36:06.700
dead, and there was a big article in the Observer 
about it when he died, A lot of his papers are

36:07.152 --> 36:13.122
currently on file at the University of Texas at 
Arlington. They relate more to Texas labor

36:13.142 --> 36:15.425
history. Latane's been active in everything 
that's come down the pike. She's currently a state

36:19.432 --> 36:26.443
employee, works for the Texas Department of 
Community Affairs.

36:30.153 --> 36:33.946
I think it's more, I'll let you know, unless 
there's certain areas. I could go on and on about

36:34.026 --> 36:38.863
people that I think know a whole lot.
