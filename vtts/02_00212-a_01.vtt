00:02.647 --> 00:18.046
Fall morning, October 29, Friday morning, and I'm 
chatting with Mrs. Jack Kenny Williams, looking

00:02.647 --> 00:18.046
out beyond her orchid area. Now, Mrs. Williams, 
say a sentence or two, and let's test your mic.

00:24.794 --> 00:25.995
Just anything. Good morning. I'm glad you're 
here. It's a treat. Now, let's... See that

00:29.299 --> 00:32.383
beautiful... Mrs. Williams, how did you and Dr. 
Williams first meet? You were back in college?

00:40.436 --> 00:41.497
Yeah, we were in college. He was a junior and I was a 
freshman. And my mother had given my brother a

00:45.102 --> 00:53.073
package of skirts that had been left behind to be 
re-hemmed. I don't know whether they were

00:54.014 --> 00:57.679
supposed to be shorter or longer. And after a 
fraternity meeting, my brother asked Jack to

00:58.030 --> 01:05.101
bring those skirts to me because we ate in the same 
dining hall. And he told someone to tell him that my

01:06.243 --> 01:12.373
skirts were behind the mirror in that foyer. And 
when I walked in, he asked somebody who that was. We

01:16.339 --> 01:17.761
didn't eat at the same table. And he decided he 
would tell me himself. Now, this was at Emory &

01:22.128 --> 01:23.870
Henry College? At Emory & Henry College in 
Virginia. It's a Methodist school. About how many

01:27.014 --> 01:27.975
students? How big was it? It wasn't large. I don't 
remember at that time, and this is 38. Three

01:33.863 --> 01:39.130
or four hundred students, probably. And how soon 
was it before he asked you for a date?

01:48.419 --> 01:49.180
I don't remember. He sort of hung around all the 
meals, sent me a flower from his table, and he would

01:49.260 --> 02:03.218
pull a marigold out of the vase or whatever it was 
and bring it over, send it over by the waiter, but I

01:49.260 --> 02:03.218
don't remember. It was a long time before he asked 
me if he could kiss me. So y'all... That was months.

02:12.571 --> 02:14.393
He asked me if I'd been vaccinated. That was a cute 
little thing that some girl had said at a pep

02:15.318 --> 02:19.824
meeting. They say kisses have germs, but you can 
kiss me because I've been vaccinated. Did you ever

02:24.790 --> 02:25.631
hear that? Did he have a sense of humor then as a 
young man? I

02:28.435 --> 02:32.921
don't know. I don't remember it registering with 
me at the time. Because I think I always remember

02:36.045 --> 02:40.271
his great sense of humor when I knew him. His sense 
of humor was almost sarcasm. Have you noticed? No.

02:45.457 --> 02:56.371
No, I wouldn't describe it as sarcasm, but... You 
know, sarcastic, you know, in a way, things he'd

02:45.457 --> 02:56.371
say was not... He was always kind, but funny. The 
girls and I giggled at him all the time. How long

03:02.479 --> 03:08.447
before you all became serious in your romance? 
Weeks, months, years?

03:13.503 --> 03:14.164
I don't know. I don't know how serious he was. He 
dated so many girls along the line, and we dated a

03:16.146 --> 03:23.453
lot, even the first year. I guess we were both 
serious before summer came. Did, at Emory & Henry,

03:26.976 --> 03:37.987
did people get, in the fraternity and sorority, 
was there a special kind of pinning or anything

03:26.976 --> 03:37.987
like that? Did you all do that? These were social 
sorority clubs, they say. They were not national

03:42.878 --> 03:44.560
at that time. You know, this is 38. This is 
Depression years. But we had rush parties and that

03:50.288 --> 03:54.693
type of thing, and he was already in the 
fraternity. He was two years ahead of me. Jack went

03:56.816 --> 03:58.819
to college at 16. I went to college at 18 because I'd 
been living in West Virginia where they had one

03:59.820 --> 04:07.590
more extra year, and Virginia had one less. And I 
think he skipped, his mother taught him to read

04:08.414 --> 04:16.324
before he ever started the school, and I think he 
skipped a year, I'm not sure. Was he a history major

04:16.865 --> 04:18.847
when you began? No, no, he was pre-law. He

04:22.452 --> 04:29.681
majored in political science. And when he 
graduated, his main professor had him a

04:30.441 --> 04:37.290
scholarship or fellowship, scholarship it would 
be, for Vanderbilt. In law? All right, but he

04:44.587 --> 04:48.531
doesn't go to law school, does he? No, the war came 
along, and money was scarier than his family, and

04:48.632 --> 04:59.785
he said he had to get a job and earn his own money way 
from then on because his father had two more

04:48.632 --> 04:59.785
children to educate. And then the war came along, 
and you know what happened. But he did teach two

05:06.346 --> 05:15.119
years before, after he joined the Marine Corps in 
December the 8th. He joined the Marine Corps, I

05:16.021 --> 05:17.824
think that's in there. And it... Now that's 
December 8th, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor. He

05:23.753 --> 05:26.958
was on the campus with me when it happened. And... 
He joined the Marine Corps the next day. But they

05:33.263 --> 05:38.576
had to wait until he could be placed in an officer's 
school. So many joined, they had to just take them a

05:39.277 --> 05:42.445
few at a time or whatever it was. Do you remember the 
two of you talking about Pearl Harbor and what it

05:42.946 --> 05:49.281
might mean to your lives? No. Because so many of us 
are, you know, where were you when you heard the

05:50.322 --> 05:56.575
news of Pearl Harbor? We were in the parlor of my 
dormitory, and I had three or four sorority

05:56.596 --> 06:06.898
sisters or friends in the room, and we had a radio 
playing, and Jack was taking turns dancing with

05:56.596 --> 06:06.898
them. And I was sitting on the sofa listening to it 
all. So he liked to dance. His father had

06:12.231 --> 06:18.098
dancing lessons. I was a preacher's daughter, and 
it was sinful for preacher's children to dance at

06:18.118 --> 06:25.448
that time, you know, and I had to just start dancing 
without any lessons. But he was used to going to the

06:25.488 --> 06:30.174
girls' schools and having a stag line. But I 
brought that to an end. He only went to one more

06:33.398 --> 06:35.661
after he met me. And he broke a date to do it. Now, did 
you tell him not to go? No, I knew he was going. I

06:42.793 --> 06:45.257
don't like this being recorded. Anyway, he said, 
would I go to the first football game with him? And

06:53.891 --> 07:04.347
when I told him when it was, either that day or 
later, there was a dead silence.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.010
And I knew that The day of the football game came, he 
did not mention picking me up for the football

07:06.547 --> 07:12.639
game, and I knew where he was. He was down enjoying 
that stag line. He had had a date already to go down

07:16.867 --> 07:22.058
there, and he didn't break it with whoever it was. 
He broke it with me. It was never mentioned. By him

07:26.155 --> 07:27.778
or me. Things just picked up and went right on. And 
he didn't mention the fact that I told my friends

07:30.562 --> 07:36.731
that I knew Jackson would break a date with me 
tonight. Now, when did y'all get serious and when

07:38.594 --> 07:45.766
were you thinking about getting married? And was 
he already in the service?

07:54.235 --> 07:55.356
No, no. My daddy brought that to a head. I was 
invited to go visit a friend in Galax, Jackson

07:58.360 --> 08:04.247
Town. She and I had met in church young people's 
programs. And I was invited to go. He may have put

08:11.335 --> 08:22.588
that together, but anyway, I wanted to go and I 
asked about getting permission to go visit Jack,

08:11.335 --> 08:22.588
although I was going to stay with this other 
friend. And my father said, are you considering

08:24.475 --> 08:28.541
marrying Jack? And I had never thought about it. 
And I said, well, I guess so. And he said, then I

08:33.227 --> 08:34.889
think you should go.

08:37.894 --> 08:39.075
See what kind of father I had? That also seems like 
your father was giving his approval. Oh, when Jack

08:43.742 --> 08:47.547
came to visit, the two of them, Both of them loved 
history, and they would spend hours talking and

08:47.797 --> 08:54.924
discussing history. They were the best of 
friends. Oh, that's marvelous. Now, when did you

09:00.970 --> 09:02.131
all get married?

09:05.034 --> 09:07.116
June the 10th, 1943. See, that's five years from 
the time we met. But also just before he leaves for

09:11.280 --> 09:14.563
active duty? In the Pacific. He left January the 
10th. We got married in June, and he left, I think it

09:19.362 --> 09:22.206
was January the 10th. And where did you spend those 
months while he was gone? In Radford, Virginia,

09:28.153 --> 09:33.160
with my parents, working for a Hercules powder 
plant. In an office, of course, checking

09:33.981 --> 09:41.530
inventory that was in the receiving department. 
And how often did he write letters? Well, we both

09:46.644 --> 09:55.937
wrote practically every day, but when he knew that 
he was going into combat, he said, no, you won't

09:46.644 --> 09:55.937
hear from me for a while. He told me later he didn't 
want me to hear from a dead man, get a letter from a

09:56.398 --> 10:00.463
dead man. And he went to the Pacific and made what 
landings? Didn't he? What islands did they land

10:11.345 --> 10:13.269
on?

10:17.036 --> 10:18.459
I can't remember the name of the first one. I wanted 
to say Roy Namor, but that wasn't. But the final one

10:22.487 --> 10:26.495
where he was evacuated was Saipan. Saipan. And he 
was wounded there, wasn't he? And where did he

10:31.645 --> 10:33.589
recuperate? On Maui. Maui, back in Hawaii. And 
Roosevelt came into his ward in a wheelchair. They

10:42.179 --> 10:45.263
always say that Roosevelt did not anybody see him 
in a wheelchair. He came in in a wheelchair and

10:45.704 --> 10:48.668
visited them. Don't you think that's 
interesting? Oh, yeah. Did Dr. Williams ever

10:51.732 --> 10:54.435
comment about Roosevelt? What did he say about 
him? Well, he just said he, you know, wrote that he

10:55.336 --> 10:57.139
was there. But Jack was, at that time, was, I guess, 
and, you know, I don't know.

11:07.302 --> 11:13.349
He didn't go on a lot about his wounds, and it was 
just shrapnel. His body had a whole lot of

11:13.389 --> 11:16.273
shrapnel. I've told you this before about the 
throbbing scar.

11:21.679 --> 11:22.120
Go ahead. Go

11:22.560 --> 11:26.525
ahead. He had a scar the size of a dime right over 
his, I call it jugular vein. Jugular vein. Jugular

11:35.476 --> 11:36.297
vein. that throbbed all the time. So on the left 
side of his lower neck? I don't know. I don't

11:42.846 --> 11:44.388
remember the side. But anyway, it was always so 
interesting to me to think that this scar was there

11:44.648 --> 11:50.497
over the vein and it throbbed. How did the scar get 
there? What happened to the shrapnel that cut that

11:54.042 --> 11:57.386
scar? Why didn't it cut the vein? It was chilling to 
look at, to see this scar throb.

12:12.220 --> 12:12.561
Why? There was shrapnel under the collarbone, 
stuff that they never got out, of course, but why

12:14.984 --> 12:27.399
did it not, he would have bled to death, of course, 
immediately, carotid artery, is what I was trying

12:14.984 --> 12:27.399
to say. Now, when did you first see him after the 
war? Where? September.

12:39.972 --> 12:41.855
September 45. Where was it? Roanoke, Virginia. I 
was teaching school and I resigned because I

12:46.422 --> 12:53.112
couldn't ask him to come and sit in there while I 
continued. And so in March we left for Atlanta for

12:53.132 --> 12:57.379
Emory University. March of 46. Yeah. Now why Emory 
instead of some other school? He had a friend in

13:03.907 --> 13:22.440
Charlie Harris from Georgia who was a graduate of 
Emory and I think he influenced him to go to Emory

13:03.907 --> 13:22.440
and I think it just had to have been Charlie Harris 
and they were the very best of friends. We went to

13:23.500 --> 13:30.515
his wedding, you know, after we moved to Atlanta 
and Charlie got married and we went to Valdosta to

13:23.500 --> 13:30.515
his wedding. And he later became a member of the 
State Board of Education. And had Dr. Williams

13:36.588 --> 13:40.075
decided that he was going to be A history major? No, 
he was going into secondary education. His

13:44.499 --> 13:47.542
teaching had taught him that there was a 
discipline problem. And he came back and I said,

13:48.403 --> 13:53.567
let's go to Harvard if you're going to be law. Let's 
just go to the best school. And he said, no, I'm

13:55.729 --> 13:58.311
going to go into secondary education. Men are 
needed in education. And so anything he said was

14:02.295 --> 14:06.579
just fine with me. You can imagine. After that 
time, we were good friends. How long before he

14:15.543 --> 14:19.230
decided that higher education was his goal? A 
professor at Emory changed that. Who was it? I

14:27.765 --> 14:28.446
don't remember. Was it Bellwine? It wasn't 
Bellwine? No, no, no. Anyway, Jack was taking

14:31.672 --> 14:34.497
history courses. And he said, this is awful to put 
in print. You're wasting your time getting a

14:38.442 --> 14:41.346
degree in education. No, that's not bad to have. 
And if you will come over and major in history, we

14:43.889 --> 14:50.539
will give you a scholarship. So this was a 
historian marketing history. How did he, was he

14:53.704 --> 15:00.113
enthusiastic about the history idea?

15:03.164 --> 15:05.589
He didn't hesitate to make the change. Neither

15:05.929 --> 15:14.646
of us ever went on about anything. He might tell me 
that the little girl next door came over and played

15:16.670 --> 15:25.948
at the house that day and he had a picture of her in a 
wastebasket or something like that. And he

15:26.536 --> 15:38.716
criticized one of the members in one of the 
trailers there on the campus for showing some

15:26.536 --> 15:38.716
broken crystal that he had brought back from the 
war that he had absconded with and was so proud of.

15:38.756 --> 15:40.258
And he was a ministerial student. Jack was 
shocked. You know, we live so close to these people

15:44.365 --> 15:52.678
that I got just a good... view of what people are 
really like when you have people that we only had a

15:53.013 --> 15:59.502
board sidewalk between us. Did you ever see that 
place on Emory campus? No, you weren't born.

16:07.213 --> 16:10.157
Between us and the next trailer. And these are all 
veterans, I'll bet. Yeah. And while he was at

16:14.844 --> 16:18.008
graduate school, what were you doing? I worked for 
a dentist in downtown the WWR building. And I

16:25.484 --> 16:28.268
commuted by bus and walked through the campus. And 
he came home and cooked the evening meal because he

16:28.889 --> 16:34.037
was on the campus to start with. And he got off at 4 
and I got off at 5. So he decided to cook and that's

16:37.602 --> 16:41.828
with life. How good a cook was he? He was terrible 
until I told him to use cookbooks. I didn't say

16:49.747 --> 16:53.439
anything until he admitted that something just 
hadn't worked out. And I said, well, start using

16:53.540 --> 16:57.854
the meat of givens, encyclopedias of cooking. 
I've told you all this before. Let's see. Let me

17:01.716 --> 17:02.477
take a break. See, I don't really like to make it 
personal where I'm concerned. I don't mind

17:07.183 --> 17:12.931
talking about Jack, but I don't want my life in 
there. When I fell in love or anything like that, I

17:13.912 --> 17:18.598
don't want that in this. I don't think it's 
appropriate. You're back in the vet village.

17:26.869 --> 17:27.330
The... I'm assuming that when the war is over, 
almost all of those veterans were determined,

17:28.694 --> 17:38.315
determined, determined to get their degree and 
get on with their life. When you all went to Emory

17:39.297 --> 17:47.715
and Dr. Williams decided to major in history, what 
did you all think you were going to be doing Well, he

17:48.775 --> 17:51.258
was going to teach from the very first. That was it. 
He wasn't going to be a lawyer. Okay. And when he got

17:54.442 --> 18:01.170
his master's degree, he said, I'm going to get my 
job while there's still one. There's so many

18:01.210 --> 18:04.834
people going to be looking for work. And so we 
decided he would apply for a place. And I insisted

18:09.219 --> 18:14.846
that it not be as big as Atlanta or small as Emory & 
Henry. And so I was using the... dictionary

18:18.627 --> 18:44.112
for a population and I thought Spartanburg South 
Carolina sounded just great and the Wofford

18:18.627 --> 18:44.112
College was there and the girls school was there 
and he applied and he applied several other places

18:18.627 --> 18:44.112
but a professor asked him to apply for Clemson so he 
said there's a man there I want you to work for and

18:18.627 --> 18:44.112
that was Miriam Kynard K-I-N-A-R-D. Did you all 
come up for an interview? Did you come to visit

18:52.360 --> 18:54.743
before he was gone? Jack did. I was working. Jack 
did. And he went to Wofford, and both of them

18:57.568 --> 19:03.416
offered him the same amount of money, Clemson and 
Wofford. Really? $2,700 for nine months' work.

19:08.804 --> 19:16.275
But Clemson had prefabricated houses that were 
headed for England. for our military over there

19:16.762 --> 19:26.212
and when the war ended they were left on the wharf in 
South Carolina and Clemson got them. And that was

19:27.213 --> 19:30.456
the deciding point for our coming to Clemson. So 
you arrived in Clemson when?

19:36.282 --> 19:36.943
1948? August of 1948. Describe Clemson College 
then.

19:46.799 --> 19:50.666
We didn't have an automobile.

19:52.749 --> 19:57.477
Clemson was just a small college town, I guess 
you'd say.

20:00.783 --> 20:05.691
We had one of most everything, and it was still 
military. The first year, there wasn't an office

20:07.674 --> 20:10.940
for Jack. He was assigned to a table in the library 
for his office. So he would come home and he would

20:16.037 --> 20:25.907
tell the students, if you want to counsel with me, I 
will meet you at this bench at our designated time.

20:26.988 --> 20:27.929
And then he would come home. And the next year he had 
an office and he shared it with a young man that

20:29.151 --> 20:42.405
became his dear friend, Hugh McCauley. sharing 
was by accident? I mean, the fact that it happened

20:45.700 --> 20:47.602
to be Macaulay? It just happened as far as I'm 
concerned. What has been the relationship of the

20:51.668 --> 20:55.973
Macaulays and the Williams now for 50 years? Well, 
we're family. We are a family. I feel by their

20:59.418 --> 21:08.410
children like they feel like by mine, and we have, 
we just did a huge He called me last night to say he

21:09.082 --> 21:12.526
was sorry he couldn't be here today, and we joked. 
He and I carry on a lot about money. For years, he

21:17.232 --> 21:25.622
invested his own money, and for his mother, and for 
his children, for his sister who was a widow. And

21:26.764 --> 21:32.130
until he lost his eyesight, he did all this 
himself, his own investing. And he was successful

21:32.971 --> 21:34.313
with it. Let's back up. Bell Wiley. What was the 
effect on Dr. Williams' career of having worked

21:39.469 --> 21:48.323
for Bell Wiley? What did he think of Bell Wiley? 
Well, they became good friends because he gave his

21:50.366 --> 22:02.545
students a chapter to criticize, and Jack was the 
only one that did. And so then he gave him the rest of

22:03.115 --> 22:05.177
the book. And they just became friends. Jack 
didn't require... See, I don't like to say this.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.573
They said he didn't require any help from him. He 
was self-perpetuated. He just did everything on

22:21.956 --> 22:25.319
his own and didn't ask his professors to help. In 
fact, he helped Bill Wiley, but Jack just... did

22:30.352 --> 23:00.223
things and they said he was the most outstanding 
student they ever had because he just didn't he

22:30.352 --> 23:00.223
just came in and did his own work and didn't have 
didn't have to be at Clemson he rose up through the

22:30.352 --> 23:00.223
ranks and I know was very proud of his role in the 
faculty senate and dean of faculties and so forth

22:30.352 --> 23:00.223
at A&M I always wondered when my title became dean 
of faculties why it was plural and not singular,

23:00.608 --> 23:05.415
dean of the faculty. Then I happened to find an old 
Clemson catalog, and I found that his title here

23:05.695 --> 23:21.377
was dean of faculties, so I thought perhaps that's 
why he suggested the same title there. At Clemson,

23:22.058 --> 23:25.603
what do you think gave him the greatest pride of his 
years here? What did he accomplish here that you

23:29.844 --> 23:34.793
think he was most proud about? I don't know.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.710
What did he enjoy most at Clemson? As I said, he 
didn't come home and say, I enjoyed this today or I

23:45.310 --> 23:51.617
didn't. I think he loved teaching. And the 
students, it was obvious that the students

23:53.900 --> 23:58.625
respected him. But he enjoyed his work for the 
graduate school.

24:09.442 --> 24:11.344
He didn't complain. He changed a lot of things. He 
had a way of making a decision and seeing that it

24:13.186 --> 24:17.751
happened. And when he came home, it was a happy 
family bit. We didn't sit around and discuss the

24:24.398 --> 24:28.042
university very often. I had ways of finding out 
what happened, but it wasn't that he came home and

24:28.123 --> 24:36.732
discussed what had gone on that day. What did he do 
when you all were here at Clemson? What did he do to

24:40.432 --> 24:42.839
relax? What was his diversion, his enjoyment 
activities? Well, we played a lot of bridge. We

24:52.102 --> 24:53.424
danced. He loved music. He read books. He built 
those steps out there. Anything he saw that needed

25:02.538 --> 25:07.565
to be done, always he did it, and he had a way of 
relaxing. The Marine Corps taught him to relax.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.934
When did you all build this house? 1960. It took us a 
long time to get a down payment. We had two children

25:18.663 --> 25:21.891
before that, two degrees before that. Do you 
remember what the lot cost? Yeah. I have two lots.

25:30.273 --> 25:31.695
$1,500 a piece. I bought the first two lots. I was on 
the list. So when they opened this, got a straight

25:35.001 --> 25:37.906
through, I was called. I was waiting on them. And I 
was going to take the one next door. And it had a

25:42.293 --> 25:46.380
ravine in it. I didn't like the ravine, so I took the 
next two. And since then, I've heard one young man

25:49.745 --> 25:56.196
who, I had a tree fall on me not long ago. And he used 
to live, he was the coach's son, and we lived across

25:56.615 --> 26:01.942
the street from him. And he had sold a lot. He still 
has his parents' home. But he sold one lot for

26:08.191 --> 26:15.761
$35,000, not far from here, and there's one on 
Woodland Way that sold for $50,000. But I'm in the

26:17.703 --> 26:18.965
middle of two. I can't sell one, and I don't want to. 
And I presume that this lot was covered with trees

26:21.128 --> 26:26.335
and you had to... Saw a few trees down to build a 
house. They cleared it for us. It was wooded. I had a

26:32.207 --> 26:35.873
lot of wildflowers at that time. Catherine, my 
oldest daughter, and I used to walk down from our

26:36.514 --> 26:44.968
apartment and pick wildflowers and take cookies 
and have a picnic, we called it. While he was here,

26:46.731 --> 26:49.335
while you all were here, Did Dr. Williams begin his 
work then with the historically black schools

26:49.872 --> 26:55.925
across the South? I know that he was very highly 
respected for his work with some of the black

26:56.045 --> 27:02.640
schools. Did that begin here while y'all were 
here? Not that I know of. He worked with Southern

27:07.102 --> 27:13.853
Association, you know that, but I don't remember 
black schools being mentioned. We integrated

27:13.954 --> 27:25.934
without any problem here because it was well 
planned, and Harvey Gant was the right person to

27:13.954 --> 27:25.934
bring in, obviously.

27:28.899 --> 27:32.485
I heard Dr. Williams told me one day about some of 
that, Describe Harvey Gant in personality as you

27:33.022 --> 27:38.049
remember him as a student. Well, I didn't know him 
as a student, of course. There's a lot in there

27:42.095 --> 27:51.167
since I was teaching so much of the time and raising 
two children and taking care of things that Jack

27:42.095 --> 27:51.167
needed me to do.

27:54.091 --> 27:56.194
Harvey Gant had a sense of humor, obviously. uh... 
he uh... went into architecture and he would tease

27:57.119 --> 28:15.887
the students and say if you make me do this i'll sit 
by you in the cafeteria now i think that told you a

27:57.119 --> 28:15.887
lot about Harvey Gant and why he has been a success 
he hasn't gone around with a chip on his shoulder

27:57.119 --> 28:15.887
since then you know he was the right person to 
integrate Clemson College, and they had the right

28:15.867 --> 28:20.894
attitude when he came. And there were no 
incidents, were there, about him? Never heard of

28:24.759 --> 28:25.820
one. Never heard of one. Now, were there women 
already at Clemson when you all arrived? Was the

28:32.429 --> 28:34.332
student body coeducational?

28:39.155 --> 28:41.018
I don't know. I don't remember one way or the other 
where they had some, I don't think so. I don't think

28:47.749 --> 28:48.650
so. But it could have been that they already had 
some women here. That

28:54.580 --> 29:03.053
wasn't, you know, my thinking at that time, see, 
when we moved in, with no automobile and I didn't

29:04.619 --> 29:09.707
work the first year and the second year I went back 
to work.

29:14.053 --> 29:20.223
I guess I thought more about Bridge than I did what 
was going on on the campus. At one time I played

29:20.463 --> 29:26.813
Bridge with five different groups and then I quit 
playing Bridge when I realized I couldn't go to

29:28.278 --> 29:32.864
bridge parties in the afternoon and raise my 
daughter, so I quit. When I came back here, old

29:33.385 --> 29:39.153
friends called and wanted me to play bridge in 
their clubs. I said, you know, I quit when I was

29:40.014 --> 29:44.681
raising my children because I couldn't do that, 
and I've never gone back. Jack and I had a computer.

29:46.423 --> 29:49.708
We played bridge with a computer, and I still have 
it.

29:53.934 --> 29:57.559
Do you remember who contacted Dr. Williams about 
the commissioner of higher education job in

29:58.113 --> 30:03.583
Texas. Who? Yeah, I do.

30:15.385 --> 30:20.695
President of University of Houston.

30:24.657 --> 30:25.798
Wait a minute. I can't remember that name either. 
We'll think of it in a minute. Yeah. They had worked

30:30.743 --> 30:32.745
together in the Southern Association. Is that 
where? He called Jack and said, Jack, I think you

30:33.766 --> 30:36.429
ought to come. I guess Jack had been contacted or 
had it mentioned to him before. They finally got

30:39.613 --> 30:44.357
the salary up to where you could make it worth your 
while.

30:49.923 --> 30:51.445
He became commissioner. I mean, he took the 
president of the Medical Center right after Jack.

30:59.594 --> 31:00.495
You mean Mickey LeMaitre? That wasn't Mickey 
LeMaitre. He was with MD Anderson.

31:07.205 --> 31:12.152
Anyway, he quit because he thought it was boring, 
and it would have been for him.

31:15.197 --> 31:23.689
When you all

31:15.197 --> 31:23.689
moved to Austin, what was your impression of 
Austin as a place to live? Did you like it? Was it

31:26.977 --> 31:27.720
pleasant?

31:30.534 --> 31:33.207
Well, of course, I didn't think it was a good place 
to raise children. because the children were

31:34.165 --> 31:37.490
growing up too fast. They had too much. I had nice 
contacts with people. But once again, Jack was

31:42.338 --> 31:46.805
gone most of the time, and I was raising two 
children. And I didn't get, in the two years, I

31:47.687 --> 32:01.168
wasn't that much involved in,

31:47.687 --> 32:01.168
you know, much that was going on because I've 
always felt not...
