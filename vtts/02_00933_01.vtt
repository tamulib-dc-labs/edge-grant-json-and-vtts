WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:04.684
It's the 18th of August, 1987. We're in Terry 
Kahn's office, and I'm interviewing Sandy

00:06.167 --> 00:10.435
Rosenblum. How do you want your name to appear on 
this document? Is it Sandy? No, it's really

00:16.467 --> 00:17.830
Sandra. Sandra. All right. Sandra, you are being 
interviewed because you have been on the faculty

00:19.640 --> 00:29.150
here for some time and no one knows what you do.

00:32.474 --> 00:37.880
We think it might be a good idea to get a handle on 
your activities. No, I think I've done just fine

00:37.960 --> 00:40.943
without anyone knowing what I was doing. Well, 
you're rarely here. You're usually in circuit

00:42.745 --> 00:45.588
somewhere. That's not quite true. So in terms of 
the history of planning education in Texas, we're

00:48.496 --> 00:56.669
here to record your role. I think the biggest role I 
have is that there's so many of my students that I

00:56.809 --> 01:03.700
share with everybody else. Obviously, they're 
not uniquely my students. Well, let's go back to

01:06.585 --> 01:10.251
the beginning. What was your background before 
you came to UK? I had a degree in political science,

01:13.458 --> 01:18.467
but between my master's degree and my doctorate, I 
dropped out. I don't think dropped out is the right

01:18.808 --> 01:20.290
word. I had not intended to go on for a PhD, and I went 
to work for a systems analysis firm in Santa

01:20.771 --> 01:26.161
Barbara. They had just gotten Charlie Har with 
secretary of HUD, or undersecretary of HUD. It was

01:33.991 --> 01:39.819
the end of the Johnson era, and there was a feeling 
that urban would have been successful. There was

01:41.361 --> 01:49.832
all sorts of space technology, and there was a 
feeling that the space technology could be

01:41.361 --> 01:49.832
applied to urban systems. And so for basically, 
you know, I used to call them World War III systems

01:50.733 --> 02:00.806
analysis firms that kind of did a lot of work for 
defense departments. We're giving fairly large

02:00.826 --> 02:02.428
grants. to look at urban transportation 
problems. And the firm that I went to work for had

02:06.426 --> 02:10.852
nobody there who was not a World War III type. And 
they moseyed down to UCLA and put up an ad, and I

02:11.353 --> 02:16.300
interviewed, and I went to work for them. And I 
worked for them for a couple of years. No, you did

02:18.082 --> 02:20.545
your doctoral work at UCLA. At UCLA. All three of my 
degrees are from UCLA. Who did you study with? John

02:24.434 --> 02:30.662
Jack Bowens, who is an expert on local government, 
especially district government. Also, I did some

02:30.682 --> 02:33.827
work and was a TA for Fran Rabinowitz.

02:36.270 --> 02:37.732
She's done a lot of things in her career. She's a 
professor now at SC, and she's going to be here.

02:40.216 --> 02:45.022
She's going to be the main speaker for the APA, the 
Texas Chapter APA Conference.

02:46.965 --> 02:51.231
Mostly, I always focused on local government, so 
the fact that I didn't have a planning degree was

02:46.965 --> 02:51.231
not and I'm here is not totally surprising. I 
always was interested in local government and

02:53.759 --> 02:59.426
local planning issues, even though I wasn't in a 
planning school. I got my master's in public

03:02.050 --> 03:15.227
administration, MPA,

03:02.050 --> 03:15.227
and then I went out into the workforce.

03:16.118 --> 03:23.969
I quickly, I knew nothing much about 
transportation, but I was the only urban person on

03:16.118 --> 03:23.969
the team under this contract. And our contract 
monitor at HUD was Leon Cole. Uh-huh. The plot

03:30.499 --> 03:31.760
thickens. The plot thickens. I did some real 
interesting work there. Mostly I was a gopher when

03:34.945 --> 03:36.928
I was young. I was by far the most junior person on 
the project. The piece of work that I cut out, or

03:40.250 --> 03:47.963
that was cut out for me, was to look at the taxi 
industry and the economic structure of the taxi

03:40.250 --> 03:47.963
industry. And it turned out I was the first person 
who'd ever done that. We did a survey, and I put

03:50.267 --> 03:54.514
together all this information. And I wasn't quite 
sure what to make out of all of it, but that was the

03:54.534 --> 03:59.222
start. I wrote a couple of articles then while 
still at this firm. What was the name of that firm?

04:06.696 --> 04:13.507
The firm was then called General Research 
Corporation and it's now changed its name to

04:06.696 --> 04:13.507
something else. And they're back doing, I think, 
largely World War III stuff. They tried the urban

04:17.113 --> 04:23.844
stuff for four or five years and had a subsidiary 
that went off and did a lot of police work. But two

04:23.864 --> 04:29.953
things happened in the end of 1970, 1969. One was 
Let me do that later. But one was that UCLA called me

04:35.764 --> 04:49.620
and asked me if I had been interested in doing a 
doctoral degree because they had a traffic

04:35.764 --> 04:49.620
safety, 10 traffic safety fellowships from then. 
The US Department of Health, HEW then. And they

04:54.085 --> 04:56.427
couldn't find enough people. Nobody wanted to 
take a traffic safety fellowship. And the

04:58.590 --> 05:00.612
requirements were not on us at all. And it was a lot 
of money. So in the end of the 60s, it was $3,000 plus

05:02.129 --> 05:07.034
tuition. And all you had to do was take one traffic 
safety course a year. It was not exactly a terrible

05:10.998 --> 05:14.701
thing. So I had been putting that off, putting it 
off. I had been thinking sort of about going back

05:18.124 --> 05:20.567
for a doctor. This came through. At the same time, 
the firm I was with got a contract in Watts in East

05:22.388 --> 05:27.173
Los Angeles. to do, it was right after the Watts 
riots, to do a major study of their transportation

05:27.811 --> 05:32.758
needs. These two incidents were obviously very 
fortuitous. I went back to UCLA with the grant and

05:35.562 --> 05:42.852
the job, had a wonderful time, became, quote, a 
transportation expert. And when I was finishing

05:43.954 --> 05:56.552
up, my old boss at this firm called Leon Cole and 
said, or came to me and said, Leon Cole's putting

05:43.954 --> 05:56.552
together a program in Texas. Would you be 
interested? And they interviewed me, etc., etc. I

06:00.802 --> 06:03.925
came down for the practice, to practice anything. 
I mean, I couldn't imagine. My mother and father

06:05.427 --> 06:09.512
had been here during the war, and my mother had 
horrible stories about Texas, Paris, Texas. And I

06:10.593 --> 06:14.057
came down, of course, fell in love with Austin. And 
I was offered the job. I took it. What year was that?

06:17.762 --> 06:18.823
It was the spring of 72. I was offered the job. I came 
here in the fall, September of 72. Mm-hmm. And what

06:24.376 --> 06:27.760
have you been doing since? Well, I'm not sure I'm 
not going to edit this out of the tape, but I did not

06:27.780 --> 06:33.027
come with my dissertation. I was ABD, and I screwed 
around for three years. It wasn't that I screwed

06:36.291 --> 06:37.633
around so much. For example, Leon left like ten 
months later, and he had a big contract. Well, at

06:41.397 --> 06:47.505
that time it was big, I don't know, $10,000 or 
$15,000 from the college coordinating board to do

06:41.397 --> 06:47.505
something about transportation. He hadn't done a 
thing, and he hadn't spent much of the money

06:47.926 --> 06:51.430
either, so I got that grant. And I used it to study 
something that I had gotten very interested in,

06:52.135 --> 07:16.959
which was low capital measures to deal with 
traffic congestion, traffic congestion in

06:52.135 --> 07:16.959
cities, not focusing on all sorts of planning 
issues as opposed to signalization and traffic

06:52.135 --> 07:16.959
lights and curbs and gutters, looking at land use 
and transit and bus lanes and how that would affect

06:52.135 --> 07:16.959
it. Subsequently, I bid on and won a very large 
grant In the end it was about a quarter of a million

07:21.920 --> 07:42.438
dollars over three years from the National 
Cooperative Highway Research Program of the

07:21.920 --> 07:42.438
National Research Council of the National 
Academy of Sciences to do a major study all across

07:21.920 --> 07:42.438
the United States of these same kind of more 
socially based traffic control measures. And for

07:42.458 --> 07:51.606
a long time I did that and then I got back into doing 
the stuff I had done when I had been with this

07:42.458 --> 07:51.606
company which was looking at the role of the taxi, 
which by this time had come to be called

07:51.822 --> 07:56.769
paratransit. And that became about mid-70s that 
flared up again. I did a lot of work from the

08:03.518 --> 08:09.806
National Academy putting together conferences 
on paratransit. Wrote a lot on that. Segwayed from

08:11.369 --> 08:17.577
there into doing a lot of stuff on the elderly and 
handicapped, because though it's not commonly

08:11.369 --> 08:17.577
known, the elderly and the disadvantaged are the 
major customers of taxes. And it's pretty, in many

08:22.726 --> 08:27.431
cases, it's evenly divided between very rich 
people and very poor people. It's people who don't

08:27.451 --> 08:29.513
have cars. And the majority of people who don't 
have cars are either business people in some other

08:29.533 --> 08:39.123
city who don't have their own car, or poor people in 
their own city who don't have their own car. And so I

08:39.463 --> 08:43.868
think through the decade of the 70s, I became... I 
think one of the country's leading experts on the

08:44.759 --> 08:50.465
elderly and handicapped and our paratransit 
notes. I haven't kept up as much on the traffic

08:50.485 --> 08:53.488
congestion stuff. In part, I do some, but not a lot. 
Then in the early 80s, I got real interested in the

08:58.212 --> 09:14.428
impact of the demographic changes in society on 
transportation, particularly to workers and the

08:58.212 --> 09:14.428
working wife, and even more than that, the working 
mother, which has just been The incredible social

09:15.404 --> 09:26.636
change of this generation, this century really, 
is not just the number of women in the workforce,

09:15.404 --> 09:26.636
it's the number of women and young children who are 
in the workforce. I know it's astonishing, and

09:27.257 --> 09:30.180
this society is just not ready for it. It needs the 
workers. It clearly needs those women and the jobs

09:32.022 --> 09:39.790
they do, but it is absolutely not structured to 
respond to their needs. We talk about valuing the

09:39.810 --> 09:45.276
family, and even feminists are rediscovering the 
family. and I sort of agree with Betty for Dan a

09:45.458 --> 09:57.535
little bit, that the feminists, they 
concentrated upper-middle-class women and

09:45.458 --> 09:57.535
forgot about the rest of everybody, and they 
concentrated women that didn't have children and

09:45.458 --> 09:57.535
whose children were already grown. But every 
country in the world, whether they're socialist

09:58.336 --> 10:12.917
or right-wing, some of them try to actively 
prevent women from entering the labor force

09:58.336 --> 10:12.917
because of social or cultural reasons, but those 
that allow women in the labor force recognize that

10:13.302 --> 10:19.889
it's important for the family that you provide 
proper child care and family support. So it's not

10:20.089 --> 10:22.072
just true of the Scandinavian countries. We hear a 
lot about it. It's true of every country I've ever

10:23.233 --> 10:26.216
dealt with. People realize that children are 
their future resource. And whether you want women

10:30.461 --> 10:38.770
working or you don't want women working, you 
realize that if they go out to work, you have to do

10:30.461 --> 10:38.770
something about your children, and you have to do 
At a minimum, you have to do something about their

10:39.593 --> 10:41.836
children. And better, you have to have all kinds of 
maternity and maternity policies, and you have to

10:41.896 --> 10:49.547
have family leave policies and part-time work. 
And this society is absolutely not responsive.

10:53.913 --> 10:55.214
Obviously, I can't deal with all that. What I've 
tended to deal with in the last five or six years is

10:55.254 --> 10:59.741
transportation. How well, what kind, all these 
new travel patterns, all these new work patterns,

11:05.176 --> 11:07.598
clearly must create new travel patterns. And 
leisure patterns. Exactly. And how do we respond?

11:10.581 --> 11:13.024
How does the transportation planning process 
respond to them? That's what I wanted to look at.

11:14.726 --> 11:27.258
And first I started from a much more technical 
view, and I really resisted the easy psychology of

11:14.726 --> 11:27.258
the day or Life magazine kind of approach to, you 
know, Time magazine just did a thing on child care.

11:27.278 --> 11:29.100
I mean, real tripping light kind of stuff. No, I 
really tried to focus in on what transportation

11:29.120 --> 11:33.765
planning models entailed how they dealt with the 
employment of women and the employment of women

11:33.948 --> 11:43.822
with children, how they dealt with how a household 
divided responsibilities and how that might

11:33.948 --> 11:43.822
impact travel patterns. If you know anything 
about it, you discover that none of the models that

11:43.842 --> 11:49.851
anybody uses is at all responsive. Lately, I've 
gone away from being so concerned with what

11:49.871 --> 11:57.762
modelers do, because you really have to be fairly 
sophisticated in a very technical way to

11:57.961 --> 12:03.233
understand what's in a model, and nobody cares. 
And I've been addressing the larger policy

12:04.055 --> 12:06.480
issues. In the early 70s, then, when I first got 
interested in this, I wrote a grant to the German

12:06.500 --> 12:12.915
Marshall Fund of the United States. And with 
support from, you know, you just halfway luck into

12:13.503 --> 12:36.675
these things, and it's an idea whose time has come, 
with support from the Dutch government and the

12:13.503 --> 12:36.675
French government, I got this grant, I did a survey 
here in the United States, I did a survey, the

12:13.503 --> 12:36.675
French government did it for me, but it was the same 
survey in Lyon, France, and the Dutch government

12:13.503 --> 12:36.675
did it in Rotterdam, so we have, you know, small 
scale, 200 families, maybe 50 families in each

12:37.077 --> 12:47.890
place, but very detailed questions about what 
they did with their kids, and how they've impacted

12:37.077 --> 12:47.890
their travel behavior, and how their household 
responsibilities.

12:51.034 --> 12:56.801
And subsequent to the German Marshall Fund, I had a 
National Science Foundation NSF grant. I had,

12:56.821 --> 13:01.346
allied with that, CNRS, which is the French 
equivalent. It was a joint grant from the French

13:01.426 --> 13:04.470
NSF and our NSF. Then I had a Rockefeller grant. 
I've had some university research grants, so I've

13:06.372 --> 13:12.240
been funded on this now going on five years.

13:14.964 --> 13:21.192
Funding runs out right about now, and I have a 
couple of flyers in the iron. I'm not real worried

13:21.232 --> 13:30.405
because I think it's such a sexy topic, if I can use 
that word, that I think there's more money in it. Do

13:30.908 --> 13:32.851
you get paid a salary as well? Oh, no, of course not. 
No, but I do get to go live in France. I live in the

13:37.117 --> 13:38.098
8283. I live in France almost a year, a community 
between France and Holland.

13:45.368 --> 13:49.153
I've spent the last five summers for two or three 
months in my apartment in Paris. It's the first

13:49.594 --> 13:54.300
year since 1982 that I have not been in Paris for the 
summer. Maybe that's why I got the impression that

13:55.124 --> 13:58.050
you're here next. I'm here in the semester 
usually. See, 82, 83, I was not. I was off, so I was in

14:01.157 --> 14:02.620
Paris. What courses do you normally attend? I 
don't teach any transportation courses much

14:05.466 --> 14:09.976
anymore because there's not as much demand as you 
might think. There's always a few people who are

14:09.996 --> 14:14.365
really interested, but not enough to sustain... 
There are a lot of jobs in transportation. Oh,

14:16.614 --> 14:19.281
that's the only reason I think I get some of the 
students. What I've noticed is, and again, I'm not

14:19.301 --> 14:25.739
sure I'm going to do this in the record, the best 
students are not particularly interested in

14:19.301 --> 14:25.739
transportation. And quite often, I get the worst 
students. Oh, dear. Yeah, there's tons of jobs.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.243
People call me all the time looking for jobs. I can 
place anybody a job tomorrow afternoon. Not

14:36.346 --> 14:37.608
necessarily in Austin. No, no. But that's been our 
experience today, I know. No, no. It's definitely

14:40.792 --> 14:41.513
true. But they're still not interested. And the 
reason is, I've had a lot of time to think about

14:42.615 --> 14:47.221
this, and a lot of educators and I have talked about 
it. I think it's not technical enough for

14:47.642 --> 14:51.467
engineers. I mean, there are technical 
components in the modeling stuff. But that's not

14:54.271 --> 15:00.120
technical enough for engineers, so it's not held 
very high in the engineering and the CE

14:54.271 --> 15:00.120
department. They have their problems filling 
their transportation courses, too, in CE all

15:00.420 --> 15:04.707
across the country. And in planning schools, it's 
too technical. It's too quantitative. You have to

15:08.432 --> 15:12.298
understand too many quantitative kinds of 
things. And the people who are drawn from the

15:12.318 --> 15:23.755
social sciences to transportation are drawn 
often to the idea of a rail system, in which I don't

15:12.318 --> 15:23.755
believe, in which most academics don't believe. 
In any case, when they discover there's no easy

15:24.123 --> 15:35.618
answers and it might be to deal with the 
transportation problems in the city, you might

15:24.123 --> 15:35.618
have to do 27 different things from carpools to bus 
lanes to... a lot of people turn right and red

15:35.868 --> 15:38.091
lights to it. You know, also, I mean, you have to 
have a whole sort of package of viable options, and

15:38.111 --> 15:44.861
you have to approach everything. Americans in 
general, you know, want a simple solution, and

15:44.881 --> 15:50.949
they discover the rail system quickly, a quick, 
simple solution. The rail system is probably not

15:51.169 --> 15:57.658
the answer, and even if it would solve some of the 
problems, it wouldn't solve a whole bunch of other

15:51.169 --> 15:57.658
problems. A lot of people come in thinking that 
rail systems are the answer to the problems of poor

15:57.678 --> 16:03.867
people or handicapped people, and then they're 
shocked to realize that You know, that that's not

16:04.235 --> 16:08.764
true at all in New York or Chicago or Atlanta or any 
of those places. And so when the quick answer goes

16:09.345 --> 16:14.595
away, a lot of them lose interest. Plus, on top of 
that, they have to learn all this complicated

16:14.655 --> 16:18.243
modeling stuff. And of course, this is not a 
program like MIT or Northwestern. You don't end up

16:20.968 --> 16:23.593
having to do a lot of modeling. When Alan was here, 
he taught some here. Mostly we ship our students

16:25.580 --> 16:30.424
over to the CE department to take the modeling 
stuff. But if you have to count anything, do any

16:30.444 --> 16:39.073
equations at all, and they've already lost the 
charisma of the subject is gone. So I rarely teach

16:39.794 --> 16:42.657
transportation courses. What I do teach is three 
out of the five or six required courses in the

16:42.677 --> 16:48.002
program. I do that because for many years I did not. 
All through the 70s, I taught only seminars when I

16:50.825 --> 16:53.968
wanted to. I saw very few of the students. There's 
hundreds of students, probably more than

16:55.796 --> 17:03.330
hundreds, who went through this program without 
ever taking a course with me. What courses do you

17:03.370 --> 17:04.692
teach now? Now I teach Introduction to Planning, 
which is some planning history, some planning

17:04.712 --> 17:10.543
theory. It's very much a skills course, writing 
skills, graphic skills. I co-teach that with

17:14.891 --> 17:17.897
Peter Koltman, who of course has the graphic 
skills. I teach the computer part, I teach the

17:18.282 --> 17:22.932
writing part, I teach some of the history. Peter 
and I share the history. And we sort of cover

17:24.776 --> 17:32.713
everything, sort of introduction to everything, 
library use. Also, I teach financing public

17:33.048 --> 17:43.159
services, which is about a third of the 
microeconomics course and then the traditional

17:33.048 --> 17:43.159
public finance course. I also teach, in the 
spring, I teach planning methods,

17:43.179 --> 17:55.933
which is all of the population projection 
methods, the regional economic methods.

17:56.673 --> 17:58.315
forecasting and so forth. Well, that's quite a 
lot. And computer stuff, yeah. And then in the

18:00.638 --> 18:03.581
spring, I usually also teach one of my seminars. In 
the last couple of years, I've taught the seminar

18:03.642 --> 18:19.982
either on single parents, or this summer, for 
example, I taught the seminar on the problems of

18:03.642 --> 18:19.982
women alone at three times in their life, the 
displaced housewife, the elderly widow, and the

18:03.642 --> 18:19.982
single woman with children. And it was a small 
course, five or six, but very successful. And I'm

18:23.706 --> 18:24.647
enjoying it. I enjoy that. For a long time, I 
wouldn't even teach my research stuff in my

18:25.597 --> 18:32.125
seminars, because I felt that there's so much else 
to cover. And I think that was a big mistake,

18:32.605 --> 18:44.779
because I have an enthusiasm about, everybody has 
enthusiasm about their research that they don't

18:32.605 --> 18:44.779
necessarily have about their planning efforts. 
I'm the person in this program who's largely

18:45.180 --> 18:52.047
responsible for our emphasis on writing skills. 
Dowell Myers was here, and I I went off to a seminar

18:54.588 --> 19:00.779
at MIT, taught by Louise Dunlap in 
1980-something. Other people still talk about

19:00.799 --> 19:02.162
it. I got into new writing pedagogy, which you may 
know something about. You don't write outlines,

19:09.175 --> 19:12.801
because writing is thinking. And you legitimize 
the thinking process, and you say, OK, at some

19:13.182 --> 19:17.710
point, you have to stop and revise, and the hard 
work comes from revising. So you have to teach

19:24.064 --> 19:29.551
revising skills, and you have to legitimate 
thinking and writing, because that's the way

19:24.064 --> 19:29.551
people do it. Writing is hard work, it's practice. 
Nobody was born being a good writer. Some people

19:34.337 --> 19:41.586
have higher skill levels, but the way you get 
better is to practice and write over and over and

19:34.337 --> 19:41.586
over and over and over again. You don't have to 
worry about your audience and all of that. So I've

19:43.368 --> 19:45.151
been writing with numbers. I've been very, 
very... forceful in that. My other colleagues can

19:48.234 --> 19:52.801
recognize it, and they tell me all the time that 
they can see it. The negative part, they can see

19:53.361 --> 19:55.905
improvement in student writing. I mean, there's 
no doubt at all. In two years, and it's not just me,

19:56.987 --> 19:58.809
of course. Obviously, the other faculty members 
have had input. But because I teach so many of the

20:02.314 --> 20:10.206
required courses, and because I stress this all 
the time, stress what things look like ever since

20:02.314 --> 20:10.206
the Macintosh has come along. Graphics have to be 
good looking. Things have to look good, as well as

20:12.789 --> 20:16.114
the content. If they look at it, there's a chance 
they might work well. Well, it's a possibility

20:20.385 --> 20:22.411
with both. What I've noticed in my years is that 
People are real busy out in the real world, and they

20:27.080 --> 20:34.511
don't have a lot of time, and they make snap judges, 
and they do judge a book by its cover, and all of that

20:27.080 --> 20:34.511
sort of thing. And it's not fair, and students tell 
me it's not fair. They tell me it's not fair to grade

20:36.935 --> 20:40.840
that way, and it's not fair that the world works 
that way. But in point of fact, I have seen junk

20:40.880 --> 20:44.546
proposals. I've been on National Academy of 
Science committees who are the worst, not the

20:44.566 --> 20:55.602
worst, but certainly far from the best proposal 
won, because it was good looking, it was printed as

20:44.566 --> 20:55.602
opposed to Xerox, they had colored paper. there's 
nothing there avoided it look good a lot of flash so

20:55.885 --> 21:20.458
i think you got to teach flash and substance at the 
same time and you know my fellow faculty see it

20:55.885 --> 21:20.458
because the papers get better and better looking 
and it's much slower they get better and better in

20:55.885 --> 21:20.458
terms of content and the neck the downside of it is 
it takes an incredible amount of time and there's a

20:55.885 --> 21:20.458
lot of students and typically to begin with Later, 
often they come back and say, I'm glad you did that.

21:23.382 --> 21:29.851
And I've had them cycling through for the last five 
years, once they've been out in the workforce,

21:23.382 --> 21:29.851
coming back and saying, oh, that's the best thing. 
I'm so glad you did that. But when you're doing it to

21:31.213 --> 21:41.547
them, a lot of them have gone all the way through 
undergraduate school without ever writing an

21:31.213 --> 21:41.547
essay or doing anything but taking 
machine-graded tests. And they've forgotten

21:41.567 --> 21:42.609
how. So it's troublesome. Well, I've worked with 
some of the people at UT Arlington and the Urban

21:48.856 --> 21:56.586
Studies Center, and I think they do some nice work. 
They're real aggressive, and they're an urban

21:56.606 --> 22:01.633
area, a real urban area, and I think they look... I 
haven't seen a lot of work from them, but what I've

22:01.894 --> 22:06.680
seen, I think it's first rate. They did some stuff 
on interlocal cooperation contracts between

22:06.700 --> 22:10.605
governments. They did some work, and they let me 
use their database on private contracting by...

22:16.919 --> 22:18.101
by local governments. In terms of what they're 
teaching, I have to confess I don't know. I only

22:21.605 --> 22:30.537
know them as, in that limited capacity, seeing 
them at APA meetings and knowing some of their

22:21.605 --> 22:30.537
work, which their work I find fine. I think I have a 
better feeling about what goes on at AAM, though

22:32.980 --> 22:39.929
you may not think so. I think I have a good sense of 
Well, I think I have a sense of what you teach, and it

22:42.603 --> 22:55.540
seems to me that in certain areas you're far better 
than anyone in the state, and that is in areas of

22:42.603 --> 22:55.540
land use, traditional planning, and history. You 
have real strength there, a real strong

22:56.581 --> 23:00.787
commitment to that. Students come out really 
knowing what they're doing. My impression is that

23:04.439 --> 23:10.448
If you come out with a master's from A&M, you can 
walk right in and take the AICP and pass it. I don't

23:10.468 --> 23:14.473
mean an exaggeration, but I think you actually 
have a higher success rate. Well, you may not have a

23:14.854 --> 23:18.760
higher success rate than our students, but I think 
fewer of our students take it. So I think if as many

23:19.180 --> 23:26.170
of our students took it as yours take it, I think 
that you would have a higher pass rate. I think

23:26.190 --> 23:27.993
you're more geared toward that. Of course, we have 
it. Also,

23:30.173 --> 23:45.759
I know a lot about that

23:30.173 --> 23:45.759
various faculty members make an active practice 
of going to communities and doing field work

23:30.173 --> 23:45.759
studies, doing studies for communities. I don't 
know. I must confess, whether you get paid for

23:46.420 --> 23:53.312
them, or you go out and seek a client, or you just do 
them, I don't know. I mean, often I even know from

23:53.478 --> 24:03.433
somebody on the faculty that somebody's doing a 
study like that, or I'm in some small community or

23:53.478 --> 24:03.433
something, and I hear that, yeah, I need something 
there, and we've done that. So I get a real sense of

24:03.453 --> 24:08.942
public service and real field work training for 
the students. There is a lot of that. In fact, I

24:11.506 --> 24:13.148
think almost too much. Well, maybe. That's 
possible. See, I don't know. I would prefer to see

24:17.390 --> 24:19.153
it more academically. Well, now, I don't know. 
It's hard to say. I would say that makes you a little

24:22.578 --> 24:25.262
more narrow than we are. But certainly in the area 
that you're strong, you're really strong. And

24:28.787 --> 24:32.152
traditionally, that's been good material for 
first jobs. Our students agitated us to do more of

24:32.252 --> 24:35.317
that. And it's not my particular interest. I'm not 
saying I necessarily disagree with it. But I'm not

24:41.586 --> 24:46.333
going to turn into a land use and zoning person 
tomorrow. You know, I do think if one of our

24:46.955 --> 24:55.325
students is competing with one of your students 
for an entry-level job, our student is in a

24:46.955 --> 24:55.325
disadvantage. On the other hand, I think that's 
what it looks like in paper. I'm not sure that we

24:57.648 --> 25:08.782
don't challenge... with the academic stuff, that 
we don't challenge the students so that over the

24:57.648 --> 25:08.782
long run they may have... they may be more 
responsive to less structured situations. When

25:08.802 --> 25:11.626
you're an entry-level person, you're in a very 
structured situation. What I try to tell students

25:13.088 --> 25:16.472
is... Sure, you should have a set of skills that get 
you a nice first-level job, okay? But things

25:21.418 --> 25:22.359
change. The computers you're learning today, 
five years from now, are going to be outdated.

25:25.322 --> 25:26.703
Somebody's going to invent something else. I 
mean, you can't... If you want to stay a computer

25:29.947 --> 25:34.431
person, okay, then no, you're going to have to keep 
up that way. Otherwise, take it... You have the

25:34.892 --> 25:42.460
advantage of lots of schools don't put you out as 
computer literate as we do. Go out, fly with that,

25:42.980 --> 25:52.352
find out what you want to do, and then use your other 
skills, your thinking, your analytical skills,

25:42.980 --> 25:52.352
you know, to develop and to get somewhere. I 
remember when there was a great push for all

25:52.372 --> 25:56.978
planets to learn Fortran. Yeah. And I resisted 
that like crazy, and I... very happy I did. Well,

26:06.187 --> 26:09.192
interestingly, I went back and learned Pascal 
last year. And I'm glad I did because I learned it in

26:09.593 --> 26:13.179
a very superficial way. And I'm glad I did because I 
understand a lot of things about SAS and SPSS,

26:13.199 --> 26:19.650
about the computer programs. But in general, I 
would say probably right now, not more than 10% of

26:19.730 --> 26:27.043
our students ever touch a mainframe. and maybe 
less will over time, because now we have SPSS and

26:27.462 --> 26:34.015
SAS running on the micros, and the micros have 
horrendous memory. On the other hand, I think that

26:34.235 --> 26:42.351
if you go out and you don't know how to run a micro, 
you should have been taught that. That's very

26:42.371 --> 26:43.954
different from Fortran. I mean, micros are like 
typewriters, or maps. I mean, they're part of the

26:47.361 --> 26:49.926
technical skill toolkit that you have to have when 
you go out into the real world. And it's very true to

26:54.171 --> 26:59.237
me that some of our students have been hired solely 
on those grounds. Now, that's fine. You know, what

27:01.139 --> 27:06.385
I say to them is you've got to make sure that you 
don't get stuck being the computer person when you

27:01.139 --> 27:06.385
really want to be a planner. And we have a couple of 
students, one who's resisted. I think he's, I'm

27:11.350 --> 27:14.614
not sure, but I think he's just gone to work for the 
county. he's just a computer whiz and he put our

27:14.881 --> 27:38.813
whole lab together and he's made money over the 
last year since he's graduated big money doing

27:14.881 --> 27:38.813
computing consulting so what he wants to do he 
wants to be a planner and he wants to use the

27:14.881 --> 27:38.813
computer but he doesn't want to be the computer 
whiz and so he's turned down a number of jobs where

27:14.881 --> 27:38.813
he would have that either had nothing to do with 
planning or where he would simply be the computer

27:14.881 --> 27:38.813
hack for people so that's difficult and i'm But in 
that sense, he sees firmly what the problem is. And

27:43.102 --> 27:46.609
if you're too good at that, then they'll take away 
the planning, the substantive stuff. So you have

27:46.649 --> 27:47.732
to watch that. Hopefully we're training people 
who can deal with the substance as well as some of

27:48.092 --> 27:56.430
the

27:48.092 --> 27:56.430
preference. Mm-hmm. Good.
