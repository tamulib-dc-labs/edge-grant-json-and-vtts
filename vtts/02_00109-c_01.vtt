WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:18.166
First of March, chatting with Dick Hervey in his 
study and we're going to talk about his student

00:02.849 --> 00:18.166
days and now I'm going to stop the machine and check 
and hope that it's working.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.990
Dick, you grew up in Greenville. Why did you come to 
Texas A&M? What were the factors that led you here

00:26.074 --> 00:31.320
instead of somewhere else?

00:32.617 --> 00:47.295
I came to A&M

00:32.617 --> 00:47.295
because of the tradition of a number of Greenville 
young men who came to A&M before me. And every one of

00:47.315 --> 00:53.523
those young men that came here before me, I admired 
very much. I had a football scholarship to go to

00:53.543 --> 00:59.130
Texas Tech. I was planning to go to Texas Tech 
because my older brother had gone to Texas Tech. I

01:06.760 --> 01:08.041
had an uncle who owned a drug store in Lubbock. I 
could work part-time and make a little money. But

01:12.667 --> 01:20.757
when it came down to the, close to the end, I told my 
mother that I was going to go to Texas Tech. And I

01:21.298 --> 01:27.025
never regretted it today in my life because I had a 
wonderful student experience. Did you come and

01:27.427 --> 01:29.930
visit before you came? I never saw this campus 
until I came in here with a fellow named Jim

01:29.950 --> 01:37.681
Atkinson. Came in here in a yellow convertible and 
I came with him very impressed by that bag. What

01:44.631 --> 01:45.872
year was that? 1938, fall of 1938. I matriculated 
with about Around 15 other young men from Great

01:54.224 --> 02:02.938
Wilkins came here in the fall of 1938. Alright, 
y'all came in a convertible. What did you bring in

02:05.201 --> 02:08.507
the way of baggage? I brought one footlocker. One 
green footlocker that had everything pretty well

02:12.653 --> 02:21.047
that I owned and I had some space left in it. So it 
wasn't very heavy. But I had been told what to bring

02:22.760 --> 02:34.415
and so I had it all pretty well marked with my name in 
it and so forth. I didn't have any uniform. I came

02:40.102 --> 02:46.470
here and I had a little money that I could buy what I 
needed. And the main thing that we wore The first

02:52.308 --> 02:58.016
week that we were here were white coveralls in a 
campaign. This campus was a sea of white

02:58.036 --> 03:02.823
coveralls. The white coveralls with the buttons 
all the way up down the front. In the back it said

03:08.191 --> 03:14.280
Texas Aggies had been across the back. And so the 
white coveralls were new to all of us. We had about

03:17.823 --> 03:24.154
2,500 freshmen in our class. And the campaign hats 
were new to us. And also, the number one thing on the

03:28.841 --> 03:38.557
campus around the class buildings were lines. 
Standing in line for everything. It was a line.

03:43.871 --> 03:46.173
Everywhere you went, you knew there was going to be 
a line. So you could just see these snake-like

03:46.314 --> 04:04.450
lines meandering around the classroom 
buildings, and all these freshmen trying to get

03:46.314 --> 04:04.450
registered and so forth, standing in line with 
white coveralls and campaign pants, all of them

03:46.314 --> 04:04.450
just lying. Now, this fellow that you came down 
with, he had already been at A&M. He was a senior. So

04:09.967 --> 04:14.133
he knew where to take you to get... He knew where to 
let me out. He was in the band hall, and my friend Jay

04:16.557 --> 04:25.251
Atkinson, who was also a first cousin of this 
fellow's, came with us. He was going to apply for

04:26.332 --> 04:32.101
the band, and so I was assigned to Goodman Hall. I 
was assigned to C Company Infantry. But when we

04:36.258 --> 04:41.846
came, he drove right to Bazell Hall and unloaded us 
all. I don't know where he parked his car. How did

04:43.488 --> 04:47.013
you get designated to C Company? I had requested an 
assignment to C Company because a lot of the

04:47.033 --> 04:53.342
Greenville boys were in C Company. And that's 
where I was. Did you have any idea what your major

04:55.765 --> 04:58.770
might be? I took pre-med. I enrolled in a pre-med 
course. until the end of my freshman

05:05.823 --> 05:12.970
year. And I decided I didn't like the sciences. So I 
took geology for another semester. At the end of

05:20.358 --> 05:24.422
the second semester, I didn't like geology. So I 
went to

05:24.442 --> 05:34.632
Colonel Eichasch, who was assistant to the 
president. And he was one of the great engineers.

05:39.347 --> 05:44.492
And I advised him, I said, Colonel, I don't like, I 
didn't like pre-med now. I've gone a semester in

05:44.512 --> 05:49.177
geology and I don't know what it looks like. He 
said, well, what are you going to do when you get

05:49.197 --> 05:50.819
out? I said, I want to be in business somewhere. He 
said, well, go over there and sign up for marketing

05:54.323 --> 05:58.127
and finance. So I went to see Mr. Dean. And he took 
all over my course records and said, well, why

06:03.299 --> 06:14.037
don't you major in marketing and finance? You'll 
be a generalist. You'll be able to do pretty well

06:15.359 --> 06:19.245
anything in my business. So I did. And due to these 
two changes in courses, I had to take a lot of extra

06:20.728 --> 06:29.442
hours my last

06:31.379 --> 06:44.272
what my last four semesters to graduate on 
schedule, but I did without ever having to

06:31.379 --> 06:44.272
go to summer school. Describe the campus 
physically when you got here in 38. What major

06:49.537 --> 06:51.739
buildings were where? Well, the academic 
building was the central point.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.268
The drill field was there in front of the MSC. But 
the MSC wasn't there. The MSC was not there. Around

07:08.839 --> 07:16.250
that block where the MSC was, was campus faculty 
housing. The military wall, which extended from

07:16.270 --> 07:31.373
the Dine Hall to Samisa Hall, was pretty well the 
center of the campus with buildings on both the

07:31.893 --> 07:42.469
east side military wall and the west side military 
wall. And the administration building at the east

07:42.489 --> 07:52.765
gate had just been finished not too long before I 
came. The university had just been turned around

07:54.208 --> 08:00.297
facing west and facing east when they built the So,

08:00.766 --> 08:21.612
my world revolved around

08:00.766 --> 08:21.612
the drill field, Goodman Hall, Goodell Hall, the 
YMCA, which is right there by the most air wall. And

08:21.632 --> 08:27.139
then the dorms in that area, which were growing per 
year. And back over here was Hart Hall. had

08:30.702 --> 08:41.881
been converted to a military building. It had been

08:41.902 --> 08:45.588
a dormitory. And the combat's

08:45.608 --> 08:54.263
office was that area, and the tank officers had 
offices

08:45.608 --> 08:54.263
in that building. I didn't have much business 
there as a

08:54.817 --> 09:03.189
freshman and sophomore when I became a junior. We 
had quite a bit of business as students.

09:07.436 --> 09:23.119
But the

09:07.436 --> 09:23.119
west campus, the only thing across the Welborn 
Road was two railroad depots and the creamery and

09:07.436 --> 09:23.119
the horse barns. polo fields, they practiced polo 
over there somewhere, and they had polo horses

09:24.618 --> 09:38.635
over there, across there, where they had the 
cavalry horses, and the artillery horses, all

09:24.618 --> 09:38.635
across the railroad. That was about all that was 
over there. What kind of impression did this

09:41.879 --> 09:45.384
campus make on you? The campus made a tremendous 
impression on me. All the dormitories were, that

09:50.858 --> 09:57.865
dining hall was absolutely awesome. We sat up in 
that main big room, no air conditioning or

09:59.406 --> 10:10.457
anything, but they had ceiling fans on the 
pedestals. And I don't know how many they had in

10:10.477 --> 10:14.281
there, but they had a lot of them. And to see, march 
in, we marched in and found a bunch of walls. And we

10:19.529 --> 10:25.757
marked right in the main entrance, right at the end 
of the military wall, our receipt company. We had

10:25.777 --> 10:32.024
tables right by one of the major doors coming from 
the kitchen. And to see all those students march

10:32.044 --> 10:43.619
into that thing and go to their respective tables 
and sit down with something unbelievable, it was

10:32.044 --> 10:43.619
really impressive. And I had not been ever much of a 
military person except for a scout. was the only

10:49.533 --> 10:57.021
kind of regimented program I'd ever been in. And 
going in the Corps and marching and learning to

10:57.161 --> 11:05.769
carry a rifle and all that was new, very much new. 
You are issued uniforms. We were issued uniforms.

11:11.996 --> 11:14.879
And what about your haircut, that first haircut? 
Well, that first haircut, we went to the YMCA. I

11:19.705 --> 11:22.949
had, it didn't bother me much. You know, we, I 
played football, I had burr haircuts all the time.

11:29.056 --> 11:34.623
In the spring and the fall, the early fall of the 
year before the workout, we had to go get our hair

11:29.056 --> 11:34.623
burred. And so, we did the same thing. However, we 
didn't have to get hair cut as short as they had. We

11:43.213 --> 11:46.557
didn't have to get our hair just cut way off. Do you 
have any idea what a haircut cost?

11:54.119 --> 11:59.445
Somewhere around 35 to 50 cents.

12:00.406 --> 12:04.911
Tell me about what it was like to be a freshman in the 
dormitory. Was there hazing? What was the

12:06.052 --> 12:08.515
routine? Well, it was just kind of awesome.

12:17.047 --> 12:26.062
I had been warned about what to expect, and I had 
been warned about the haste, the ESX haste.

12:28.526 --> 12:32.152
It was a good experience.

12:33.153 --> 12:41.687
First place, they said the South Boards made lots 
of messages and stuff. sophomores would have a

12:42.241 --> 12:44.944
meeting with the freshmen. They called them bleed 
meetings, bleed sessions.

12:51.671 --> 12:59.900
And there, they didn't have this Aggie, whatever 
they called it, where you had to learn all the dorms

12:51.671 --> 12:59.900
and everything. That wasn't much in the picture at 
that time. But the primary thrust was, freshmen,

13:02.223 --> 13:08.750
you've got to know every person in this company. 
You've got to know their name. where their

13:11.587 --> 13:13.230
hometown was. That's the first thing you've got to 
learn. And also you've got to know where Casey's is

13:15.433 --> 13:23.566
so you can run details. Go there and get a coat of 
coat or something. I never had much trouble

13:24.548 --> 13:28.194
remembering names. I was pretty good at 
remembering names. When they said you've got to

13:29.336 --> 13:34.604
learn everybody's name, I got to thinking. And 
they'd test us. They'd get up and say, freshman Who

13:39.346 --> 13:39.947
is this? Who is that? Where is he from? Where is he 
from? And they'd try to excite you and make you,

13:42.369 --> 13:48.214
upset you and everything. But we all had to go 
through that process. And we had to, they said, you

13:51.757 --> 13:56.342
gotta shake hands with everybody you see. You 
gotta speak to everybody you see. You gotta shake

13:58.644 --> 13:59.465
hands. If you don't know them, you gotta shake 
hands and say, I'm Fish Hervey. And you gotta speak

14:04.549 --> 14:07.632
to everybody. And

14:07.915 --> 14:19.687
then when they felt like they had hazed us a little 
bit, like beating butt-wise, they told us there

14:07.915 --> 14:19.687
was going to be an Airbus and they did. What was the, 
what kind of paddle or instrument did they use?

14:24.693 --> 14:27.676
They had handmade paddles. They were about this 
long. I've got one out in the country. They've got

14:31.159 --> 14:36.505
one about, they're about this long with a handle 
part. And then they were about that wide and about

14:36.772 --> 14:41.978
the size of a 1x4 board. A little smaller than a 1x4 
board. Now, some people say, oh, he beat me to death

14:44.761 --> 14:51.228
with a baseball bat or something like that. But I 
never saw a baseball bat. They were paddles. And

14:53.751 --> 14:57.775
hell, I was so little and pretty muscular. And 
hell, they'd say, get a pooch. I'd get a pooch. And

15:00.999 --> 15:03.101
they'd beat me all day. It wouldn't hurt me too bad 
after I caught on to how to handle them.

15:14.656 --> 15:16.558
Let's go back to dormitory life. Was your freshman 
roommate a special person in your life? My

15:21.904 --> 15:25.789
freshman year, I had two roommates. One was a 
fellow named Ross Meredith. He came from Dallas.

15:31.755 --> 15:40.065
He was kind of a hell-raising character, full of 
life, full of him and bigger, and not very

15:31.755 --> 15:40.065
studious. And my other roommate was Whit Stockley 
who came from Marion, Arkansas. His people were

15:50.594 --> 16:13.097
cotton farmers in the Mississippi Valley and he 
was rather quiet and had a deep south voice but was

15:50.594 --> 16:13.097
not a very good student and the three of us got along 
well, enjoyed each other. But three in a small room

16:19.168 --> 16:28.039
in Vibram Hall just was not conducive to very good 
study. We had three bunk beds, three, one, two,

16:28.099 --> 16:36.690
three, stacked like that. I think Wood slept on the 
top bunk. Ross slept on the bottom because he was a

16:39.534 --> 16:43.118
big fella. and I slept on the middle bunk. How did 
y'all determine who got what bunk originally? I

16:49.119 --> 16:50.021
don't remember. I don't remember how we decided 
that. We had each had a study table. Yeah, describe

16:58.072 --> 16:59.174
that room. Yeah, we had three study tables. We all 
had to go buy us a lamp. That was one of the first

17:04.141 --> 17:07.225
things we had to do was buy a lamp. It was a round 
lamp, a desk lamp, kind of like that. And we had a

17:13.000 --> 17:20.132
book rack that was more or less homemade by 
somebody around here. And they sold it. I think

17:21.875 --> 17:24.579
they sold it for about $2 or $3. You put this book 
rack back here on the back of your study table and

17:24.600 --> 17:32.473
that's where you kept your books and so forth. And 
another thing you had to have was wooden shower

17:32.493 --> 17:36.780
shoes. because we used, we walked barefooted a 
lot. None of us had a house that never did use them.

17:43.663 --> 17:50.290
So we walked in the halls all the time down to the 
showers and we had to keep from getting athlete's

17:43.663 --> 17:50.290
foot.

17:53.653 --> 18:03.243
So we all had a big bottle of Benzoyn or something to 
put on our feet if we got a touch of athlete's foot by

17:53.653 --> 18:03.243
treating ourselves. Now the restroom and shower 
facilities were down the hallway. Yes. In a gang

18:07.777 --> 18:09.780
fashion. In a gang fashion, that's right. Just 
like a barracks, army barracks. Describe a

18:15.389 --> 18:21.739
typical freshman day, Monday through Saturday. 
What time did y'all get up and what time did you do?

18:25.425 --> 18:27.288
Well, we got up about six. We had to clean our own 
room. And then about seven, a little before, we had

18:32.279 --> 18:40.069
to go into our rooms where we were room-marking. 
See, we all had to clean up somebody else's room,

18:40.089 --> 18:44.874
too. So I cleaned up Darcy McCurry and Jack 
Henderson's room. Bill Amickson and I did. Bill

18:52.183 --> 18:55.427
was my next-door neighbor. And the seniors had two 
room-markings. And we'd go into their room until

19:00.460 --> 19:05.627
about 7 in the morning. We'd wake them up. And then 
get up and we'd start to clean up. And then, boy, it

19:11.616 --> 19:20.388
must have been earlier than that because we had to 
fall in and march to Subesa Hall. And we had to be out

19:20.729 --> 19:24.955
of there at the first class at 8 o'clock. So I guess 
all that got to move that up a little bit or move back

19:24.975 --> 19:29.421
a little bit. Anyway, once we got rid of doing our 
little chores like making unfurling rooms and our

19:30.228 --> 19:43.627
upperclassmen's rooms, we just had one room. At a 
certain time in the morning, we'd fall in out on the

19:43.647 --> 19:48.034
military walk. And then we could hear the commands 
up and down the military walk when we were ready to

19:49.897 --> 19:55.885
start marching. We'd start marching in. And we 
marched into the dining hall and ate at a regular

19:58.105 --> 20:05.514
place, the same tables every day. But after we 
finished eating breakfast, we were free to just

20:05.534 --> 20:13.103
walk back out as we wanted to. What was a typical 
breakfast menu? Well, a typical menu was

20:15.005 --> 20:25.378
scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, and Dunwaden, 
we called it bread, rolls, or toast. coffee, milk,

20:26.641 --> 20:31.227
we didn't drink much coffee in those days. They 
served milk in those little bottles, old

20:31.247 --> 20:44.623
fashioned bottles, and like that, came from the 
dairy, and we each would, we could drink as many of

20:31.247 --> 20:44.623
those as we wanted in the dining hall. Not supposed 
to take them out, but we just took them out all the

20:45.865 --> 20:51.692
time for our upperclassmen. We said, bring me a 
bottle of milk, and we'd do that. When we finished

20:55.497 --> 21:04.126
breakfast, we'd go to the post office, walk to the 
post

20:55.497 --> 21:04.126
office. We all had mailboxes in the post

21:04.146 --> 21:11.914
office there, where it is now. And we'd check our 
own boxes. Sometimes we'd check other people's

21:13.635 --> 21:16.739
boxes. Then we'd go home and get our books and stock

21:16.759 --> 21:24.947
device.

21:25.940 --> 21:35.475
We'd be in class normally most of the morning, 
Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays, you know, just

21:25.940 --> 21:35.475
whatever your schedule was. But we'd get back to 
the dorm and fall in again and march to the mess

21:36.957 --> 21:45.691
hall, dining hall. After the lunch, we'd walk back 
and go back to our dorms and get our books and head

21:51.303 --> 21:57.569
off for our afternoon classes. We had drills on 
Thursday, which was ROTC day. We had

22:01.053 --> 22:05.577
a drill every Thursday. And that was from 1 o'clock 
in the afternoon until 5. And

22:07.539 --> 22:16.388
we had classes on Saturday

22:07.539 --> 22:16.388
morning. Nothing

22:16.408 --> 22:20.351
in the afternoon Saturday. We had noon through the 
third. that at night, about whatever time it was,

22:22.724 --> 22:43.075
we'd fall in again for our evening meal, and when we 
took you over, we came back to the YMCA, the front

22:22.724 --> 22:43.075
steps of the YMCA, where they had the jail 
practice. And we stayed there until the jail

22:43.095 --> 22:49.525
practice was over, which by then was dark, it was 
dark. And then we went home, back to the dorms, and

22:50.568 --> 22:59.360
then hit the rooms and studied. And then the lights 
out? The lights were out about 10.30.

23:05.789 --> 23:12.078
Did you have any late afternoon free time except on 
Saturdays and Sundays? Depending on your

23:12.178 --> 23:14.321
schedule. What would you do during those 
unscheduled hours? What I did, usually if I had

23:17.568 --> 23:25.757
say, if I had as much as two hours, I'd go

23:17.568 --> 23:25.757
to the library. We'd paddle around, we'd spend a 
lot of time over at the athletic department, we'd

23:26.738 --> 23:35.288
spend a lot of time at the gym. We'd go to the gym and 
do something. We'd wrestle or we'd box or we'd play

23:36.590 --> 23:42.917
handball.

23:44.332 --> 23:52.385
I spent almost all of my time when I wasn't involved 
or told to be doing something in the library. Not

23:52.405 --> 23:57.172
doing research or anything, but just studying and 
all that. Did anybody ever go to sleep in the

23:57.332 --> 23:59.436
library? All the time. Oh. All the time. Did 
anybody bother? No. Oh. No. You see, they had a rule

24:05.545 --> 24:12.516
that we could not take a nap.

24:16.006 --> 24:24.117
We were going at such pace that we would just become 
exhausted. And I would go to the, many times I would

24:24.137 --> 24:30.785
go to the library and just lay down on the big table 
and just go to sleep. I never was. Now I had trouble a

24:34.050 --> 24:40.478
few times going to sleep in class because I just was 
exhausted. I remember old Major Orr woke me up one

24:41.352 --> 24:48.663
time and asked me to answer a question. And I didn't 
know what the question was, but I said, Major,

24:48.723 --> 24:55.934
would you please repeat the question? Something 
about good hygiene. I don't know. Anyway, once he

24:58.498 --> 25:02.484
repeated the question, I could answer it, but I was 
asleep. Describe the mealtime routine for lunch

25:02.504 --> 25:06.550
or supper. for a fish? Well, a fish had to do all the 
waiting on the quality of the classic. They had to

25:14.931 --> 25:20.857
see that they could be served with the main meal of 
the day, like fried chicken. See that they had the

25:20.877 --> 25:23.179
mashed potatoes. See that they had the gravy on it. 
See that they haven't done the water and sugar and

25:26.763 --> 25:33.169
all of that. Once they all got served, then us fish 
could eat. We had to wait until all the other

25:37.242 --> 25:41.150
classes, sophomore, junior, senior. Did you all 
then sometimes remain in the dining hall at the

25:41.170 --> 25:46.742
table when they finished? Yes. Then you could eat. 
Then we could eat more than we could have

25:48.165 --> 25:51.532
otherwise. But they would keep bringing us food. 
We never were without food. Sometime we would

25:56.021 --> 25:57.985
sharpen desserts. because they did serve us a lot 
of desserts, and sometimes the upper classes

25:58.707 --> 26:06.136
would take part of the pies out of the dining hall. 
What were your favorite dishes? Well, I liked the

26:09.780 --> 26:19.792
fried chicken, and they served a lot of it until I 
finally burned out on it because they didn't serve

26:09.780 --> 26:19.792
so much of it. But all that food they served was 
good. Was there anything that you remember you

26:22.535 --> 26:25.879
didn't like? I don't remember that. They served, 
mostly I remember the bread was a sort of a roll. It

26:39.012 --> 26:40.053
had plenty of butter. It had iced tea. It had milk. 
And breakfast they served eggs, pancakes, and

26:45.361 --> 26:56.136
bacon, sausage, and coffee. And I think orange 
juice. And

27:02.081 --> 27:06.889
it was every meal was seated. Every meal was 
seated. Let's try to record as much as we can of the

27:09.813 --> 27:17.445
chow hall slang. Oh, okay. I was just thinking 
about some of that. Let me think. Well, rabbit was

27:20.810 --> 27:25.417
salad. That was the letters. Salt and pepper was 
sand dame.

27:31.944 --> 27:33.386
Salt and pepper sand dame. Ketchup was what? Bud, 
buddy. Pass the buddy. Any

27:40.636 --> 27:47.064
dessert was kush. Milk. Milk was what? Cow. Cow. 
Cow. Yeah, and bull, bull, bull neck, bull meat,

27:54.706 --> 28:07.502
bull neck, about the size of a bull neck, was the 
meat. And, uh. Tea? Tea was what? Was that horse?

28:15.431 --> 28:16.032
Could have been. There was something. Yeah, yeah. 
Let's see, you mentioned bread was. Bread was

28:19.977 --> 28:21.098
gunwale. Gunwale. And sugar was what?

28:30.278 --> 28:37.548
Let's

28:30.278 --> 28:37.548
see. Beans.

28:42.775 --> 28:42.895
Beans. That was... Oh, yeah, there's something 
for beans like blowout. Corn.

28:52.489 --> 28:55.813
Corn.

28:55.833 --> 28:57.055
Beans. Oh, it had to be something like Do

28:59.033 --> 29:17.625
you remember any, when you were finishing, do you 
remember any dining hall tricks or pranks? They

29:19.148 --> 29:24.096
were playing pranks all the time in the dining 
hall. and that usually was an assigned chore that

29:24.413 --> 29:30.882
somebody had to do. For example, sometimes they'd 
designate some freshman to act like a moody bird

29:30.902 --> 29:42.118
and fly over the play like he was flying and he'd go 
over and get right in front of somebody and just

29:42.520 --> 29:51.632
flap his wings and do something crazy like that. 
And they were just practical jokes at that time.

29:56.638 --> 30:04.549
Did y'all ever, did they ever pull any prank off on a 
sophomore or a junior?

30:04.569 --> 30:06.291
Yeah, yeah. If he looked away, did anybody ever put 
any? Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, they were putting this

30:13.148 --> 30:34.462
Let's

30:13.148 --> 30:34.462
see,

30:13.148 --> 30:34.462
with your outfit,

30:13.148 --> 30:34.462
did your outfit have a nickname? Yes, C-Company. 
C-Company, okay, so it worked. After the 12 new

30:40.739 --> 30:47.985
dormitories were built, they moved me out of C 
Company and moved me into K Company. I was in dorm 3,

30:48.005 --> 30:54.991
and I lived in dorm 3 for then 3 years, which was in 
what we called the new area. Now the new area opened

30:55.152 --> 30:56.593
in? In the beginning of our sophomore year. 39? 39. 
And how did those dormitories seem to y'all

31:02.578 --> 31:07.742
compared to what you had first year? They seemed 
good? They seemed good. In the first place, they

31:11.401 --> 31:14.586
were all on one level. They still had the four 
flights up and down, but they had two sections of

31:14.606 --> 31:29.127
bathrooms on each floor, one on one end of the 
building, one on the other. One wide, about seven

31:29.147 --> 31:36.818
feet wide hall, right down the middle.

31:37.591 --> 31:42.493
a stair at one end of the building, another stair at 
the other end of the building. And they had one

31:42.513 --> 31:45.205
trouble with them.
