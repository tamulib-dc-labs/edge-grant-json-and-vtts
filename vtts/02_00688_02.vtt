00:01.718 --> 00:02.840
I'll ask you that question one more time. What do 
you feel, then, since you've been here, what, nine

00:05.184 --> 00:23.954
years, some of the highlights or some of the things 
that have happened, and I also, everybody's been

00:05.184 --> 00:23.954
reluctant to share their contributions because 
they feel like somebody else should talk about it,

00:05.184 --> 00:23.954
and I have heard some of the things that you've 
done. Most of it has to do, a lot of it has to do with

00:24.014 --> 00:28.722
what you have brought into the university through 
all your grants, but Even maybe some little

00:29.174 --> 00:36.526
personal insights or anecdotes that I would not 
find in the documents that are just from Linda

00:29.174 --> 00:36.526
Parrish. Well, my greatest, if you ask anybody, 
people would say my greatest contribution has

00:36.987 --> 00:45.942
been bringing in several million dollars into 
Texas A&M. To me, that's not my greatest

00:46.363 --> 00:49.428
contribution at all. Okay. I do that because it 
seems to me that the things I do need doing for the

00:51.331 --> 01:02.007
state of Texas, and that is helping disabled 
students access quality education. And that's

01:02.067 --> 01:05.392
why I do that, not to bring big money into Texas A&M. 
It happens that that supports graduate students,

01:05.913 --> 01:11.061
and those are good byproducts. I do that because 
there are things that need to be done in Texas. Say

01:14.586 --> 01:16.229
that, helping disabled students? Access quality 
education in our schools. I think that's the main

01:20.916 --> 01:23.880
thing, the reason I do that. And it's just not to 
bring money. Although, as you heard at the

01:26.003 --> 01:33.695
development committee, our provost was saying, 
you brought in this much money and we want you to

01:26.003 --> 01:33.695
bring in this much more money. If it was just 
bringing in money, I'd say, That's not the point.

01:39.239 --> 01:41.922
The point is to do products. Last year's grant are 
those two blue volumes there. And as a result of

01:46.407 --> 01:55.437
writing those materials, we have about eight 
different universities now teaching a class

01:46.407 --> 01:55.437
similar to the one I teach here that we didn't have 
materials for. So those things are really

01:55.477 --> 01:57.740
important. But bringing in just the money is not 
important. I would say that for the university, my

02:00.723 --> 02:07.170
greatest contribution and the greatest 
highlight for me was being elected to the faculty

02:07.150 --> 02:13.461
senate the first year it was founded at A&M. I was 
one of eight women in the entire university that

02:14.503 --> 02:22.237
got elected and one of two women that got elected to 
the executive committee. And that I guess will

02:25.358 --> 02:43.732
always be the most important thing to me is that I 
was trusted by my colleagues to be voted in from the

02:25.358 --> 02:43.732
college bed and then trusted by all the colleagues 
in the Senate, primarily men from other colleges,

02:25.358 --> 02:43.732
to run the Executive Committee. And that, to me, is 
really important because what we've done in the

02:43.752 --> 02:47.839
Faculty Senate has really changed Texas A&M. Ask 
the students. They'll tell you a lot of things. You

02:52.553 --> 02:54.416
know, we're making senior state exams. They hate 
that. You know, and those aren't the important

02:55.638 --> 02:57.120
things. Those are the things that get pressed. But 
there are important things. As of next year, we'll

03:01.046 --> 03:10.559
have a core curriculum where people could use to 
come to the university and get through an

03:01.046 --> 03:10.559
engineering degree and not know how to write a 
memo. They'll never be able to do that again. And

03:13.584 --> 03:15.767
it's only because of the fact they're safe. And 
that, to me, that's made a contribution. So in

03:18.730 --> 03:23.476
other words, the core curriculum came about as a 
result of something that the faculty said it saw a

03:18.730 --> 03:23.476
need? The only reason. The only reason. The 
faculty said, this is ridiculous. If we're

03:27.181 --> 03:38.655
calling ourself a world-class university and you 
can get out of here without taking an English

03:27.181 --> 03:38.655
class, without understanding anything about 
humanities, then this is not a university. But you

03:39.256 --> 03:40.518
get a lot of resistance. Oh, it's terrible. My 
husband was the one who proposed the core

03:41.799 --> 03:44.843
curriculum for this university. And he has really 
gone through quite a lot as a result. But he's

03:50.774 --> 03:54.879
enjoyed the fruits of it because it's finally 
passed. And everybody will see the value. Or they

03:57.702 --> 03:58.904
already do, I'm sure. Absolutely. Well, so good 
and so dumb. But the history of our university is so

04:01.327 --> 04:05.051
diverse. It's not like a... what you expect a major 
university to be. Why do you think there's been so

04:09.685 --> 04:11.567
much resistance? Because now every department or 
every college has to go and adjust their

04:11.627 --> 04:18.836
requirements so that it will fit into the core 
curriculum, or will they adjust it? Oh, everyone

04:18.856 --> 04:20.217
has to. Everyone that has an undergraduate 
program at Texas A&M has to include the

04:20.317 --> 04:30.709
requirements of the core curriculum to make sure 
that our graduates, when they leave here, know a

04:30.689 --> 04:35.857
little bit about the broad basis of education. But 
to do that, do they have to take away some of their

04:35.877 --> 04:38.721
courses? That's what I mean by adjustment. I know 
they'll all have to comply, but what is that going

04:40.964 --> 04:44.390
to do to them? I imagine that's what some people 
have done. Now, we didn't have to in education

04:46.613 --> 04:53.303
because we tend to be a broad-based liberal arts 
type-oriented discipline. Those in engineering

04:53.423 --> 04:59.953
who have screamed, and agriculture who have 
screamed the loudest about it, were the ones who

04:53.423 --> 04:59.953
had such... such straight-laced courses that 
they tended to promote themselves, and you can't

05:01.064 --> 05:09.265
live without 14 hours of this same thing, right? 
And quite frankly, some of those may have to go to a

05:09.966 --> 05:14.678
fifth-year program as a professional school. Or 
drop some of the things and maybe what not. That's

05:16.893 --> 05:17.474
right. I mean, we even had a college dean from the 
business say that, you know, it was not necessary

05:17.494 --> 05:22.960
to take 12 hours of banner. You know, you can do with 
a lot, because there was not an opportunity then.

05:26.124 --> 05:26.665
That's right. We've just been feeding ourselves 
by saying, the more classes I make you take, the

05:26.765 --> 05:37.298
more classes I teach, and the more faculty we have, 
and then we're just like a dinosaur.

05:40.687 --> 06:00.275
I think all of these things are just extremely 
important, and when I retire from Texas A&M, if I

05:40.687 --> 06:00.275
retire here before I leave or do something else, I 
think there will be nothing more important than

05:40.687 --> 06:00.275
the establishment of the Faculty Senate and the 
things that it's done. And if you will share some of

06:00.996 --> 06:05.162
those things, because I don't have any documents 
on the Faculty Senate. If you have anything that I

06:05.182 --> 06:09.748
could do, I would really appreciate that. Are 
there any inside anecdotes, any kind of

06:10.150 --> 06:16.659
observation, something that stands out in your 
mind besides your contribution? Is something

06:16.759 --> 06:23.828
that happened that was kind of neat, that was 
totally off the record, that is not documented

06:16.759 --> 06:23.828
anywhere, just your own? About within just my 
personal relationships with people? It could.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.780
Yeah, that would be different. Oh, gee, I'd really 
like to think so much about that. I guess...

06:41.909 --> 06:44.874
I think about just the way I was hired was 
incredible. When you come to a school to get your

06:44.934 --> 06:52.325
doctorate, you never in the wildest estimation 
think you'll be hired there. I never did. I never

06:54.108 --> 06:58.074
thought, I never applied to be here, anything. I 
was getting my degree, I was finishing up my

06:58.095 --> 07:06.668
dissertation, and sent out a letter and was... 
flown up there for an interview, and when I came

07:07.036 --> 07:15.048
back, Dean Huber had heard I went, and called me up 
to his office and says, how did you like Minnesota?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.271
And I said, well, it's terrific, it's cold, etc. 
And he said, well, I tell you what, Linda, he says,

07:18.753 --> 07:24.963
if you'll call them right now and tell them to take 
you off their short list, we'll hire you here.

07:25.664 --> 07:28.929
Well, it was just like, I could not believe it. My 
husband was here, my children were here, it was

07:30.371 --> 07:35.338
just something we never considered, you know. So 
when I look back at that, I think, man, was I lucky.

07:40.018 --> 07:48.670
Now, on the other hand, I have to say that goes 
against everything I believe as a faculty

07:40.018 --> 07:48.670
governance person to say, who has the right to 
hire? A dean shouldn't have done that. The

07:51.654 --> 07:54.258
department should have decided, do we need 
somebody? What kind of person do we need? Do we

07:55.900 --> 07:57.342
search for someone? But in my case, nine years ago, 
or ten years ago when I was hired, on me that, you

08:02.791 --> 08:09.639
know, this was probably not appropriate, but it 
was something that he did, and I was grateful for

08:02.791 --> 08:09.639
it. And that was typical of that administrative 
partnership. That never happened. It would not. I

08:15.266 --> 08:18.951
just don't believe it would ever happen again. 
There's things to change. That's right. Is there

08:21.254 --> 08:24.698
anything else that you'd like to share and... In 
conclusion, anything that you want to include?

08:28.502 --> 08:31.726
And it can be negative because I didn't put any 
negative questions in. I don't know whether maybe

08:31.746 --> 08:34.008
I should. Maybe this is too Pollyanna. Maybe not. 
It's not realistic. I'm finding that there's a

08:37.633 --> 08:40.536
reluctance. I don't know if it's the tapes or what, 
but there's a reluctance to get into things, and it

08:40.576 --> 08:47.344
doesn't have to be on tape. I'm being quite candid 
with you. I appreciate that very much. I don't

08:52.469 --> 08:58.144
really care because people do either know how I 
feel about things. The only way to be a great

08:58.647 --> 09:13.583
university, which I think we are, is to be a, and 
I'll use this again, lovingly critical one, to

08:58.647 --> 09:13.583
care enough about the place where you work to be 
able to see if there's something that can be done.

09:13.603 --> 09:17.287
And I think we are now at that point where we can do 
that. In the past, we have been, yeah, we're great,

09:17.307 --> 09:20.771
we're great. We can float on Texas A&M's 
reputation. and say, of course we're great. We're

09:26.658 --> 09:27.840
at Texas A&M. I've done that a lot in my life. But now 
we are so good in the College of Education that we

09:30.023 --> 09:36.313
can say, we need to change this. We need to do this, 
and we can even become happy. That's something

09:38.797 --> 09:43.885
that we constantly need to do, and then that will 
signify how good we are. Do you think that the

09:44.466 --> 09:48.212
majority of the faculty is... adaptable enough to 
go along with drastic changes like that? It's

09:52.349 --> 09:55.175
getting that way with more retirements. And I hate 
to say that right after you've talked to Jim Boone,

09:55.235 --> 10:02.870
because Jim Boone is the most open-minded, 
forward-looking person we have, and he's

09:55.235 --> 10:02.870
retiring. So it's not all... You can't really 
classify older with that, because he's

10:03.331 --> 10:08.342
wonderful. But... I think that some of the new 
young excellent and given the opportunities

10:10.248 --> 10:16.579
they'll be able to get. I think sometimes we don't 
think we're good enough ourselves and

10:16.599 --> 10:28.138
occasionally when I visit other good places I just 
think, my goodness, I work with some of the best

10:16.599 --> 10:28.138
people in the world. And I love to come back and let 
them know that. The other day at the Development

10:30.822 --> 10:36.371
Council, I told Brian Copco, I said, you know, this 
is my favorite part. Because to hear a little

10:36.852 --> 10:47.950
sketch on my floor is, for example, or Stan 
Carpenter or, you know, whoever, David David, we

10:36.852 --> 10:47.950
ought to do that more often. The recognition of 
teachers, we could never do enough. I know,

10:51.941 --> 10:53.364
because they're wonderful. And I work two doors 
down from Vi, and we just take each other for

10:53.524 --> 10:58.353
granted. And I just love hearing that about the 
people who wear those awards. Well, I'm sure we all

11:01.639 --> 11:04.885
heard the same things about you when you got it. 
Well, it makes you feel good. It really does. But it

11:07.109 --> 11:10.174
also reminds us, and we too often forget, of what 
tremendous talent that we have just around the

11:10.154 --> 11:14.100
corner. And you know what? My husband, well, let me 
conclude by telling you that I really appreciate

11:15.162 --> 11:23.294
you giving me all this time, and I hope that I can 
come back and pick your brain a little bit more. If

11:23.314 --> 11:31.486
things come up where I can call you to ask you a 
question, and that we'll tie all this together

11:23.314 --> 11:31.486
when I get everybody's interviews and then start 
putting the pieces together. That'd be good. And

11:32.027 --> 11:33.970
I'm going to get you a transcript. I hope so.
