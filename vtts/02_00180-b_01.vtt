WEBVTT

00:03.642 --> 00:06.385
Can you move some of these around as you edit them? 
Of course. You've got some topics that you wrote

00:07.587 --> 00:09.389
down. Please share those.

00:15.255 --> 00:17.057
It'll work that way, huh? I'm hooked up. I wanted to 
mention something. You asked me about people that

00:22.123 --> 00:32.535
had supported me through these early years, and 
one I definitely wanted to mention was George

00:22.123 --> 00:32.535
Kunze. because he was the graduate dean at that 
time. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention him. And

00:41.506 --> 00:52.218
I've always been one Haskell that kind of said, the 
administrator's a nice figurehead, but if you can

00:41.506 --> 00:52.218
get along good with his secretary, you got the job 
half made. And Jane Thompson was always one who

00:52.278 --> 00:57.544
would welcome me and listen and help me. arrange 
whatever needed to be done to make it work well. So I

01:02.154 --> 01:04.097
really wanted to mention Kunze. In relation to 
Kunze, as far as you were concerned in program

01:04.337 --> 01:14.734
quality and development, what role did the 
graduate dean play?

01:17.758 --> 01:23.127
You mean other than just strictly rubber stamping 
approval or disapproval, I think? I think he did an

01:23.714 --> 01:28.498
excellent job of trying to minimize conflicts and 
overlaps. That was the most important thing I saw.

01:32.602 --> 01:49.618
And if he sensed that there would be a problem in 
those areas, he would set out to fix it by getting

01:32.602 --> 01:49.618
the competing or interested parties together and 
make sure that it was resolved before the full

01:32.602 --> 01:49.618
approval. Now, he was an agronomist. Yeah. Did 
that was an advantage to those of you in

01:52.826 --> 01:56.091
agriculture? Probably, I think so. At one time, a 
lot of the administrative channels were

01:58.294 --> 02:09.853
controlled by agriculture or staffed by 
agriculture people.

02:11.437 --> 02:17.165
Another thing I overlooked was in the early days of 
the department, it's kind of a little humorous

02:11.437 --> 02:17.165
thing. I don't know if you're aware of this, but one 
of the first people I met when I got here was Lou

02:18.367 --> 02:26.118
Hodges. I mentioned him earlier being our 
undergraduate advisor for many years. And Lou had

02:30.324 --> 02:32.507
been an honor student at Rice. His father's a 
faculty member there. And he had written to A&M

02:36.698 --> 02:47.490
when he saw an announcement in the Houston Post, I 
think it was, of A&M creating this new department

02:36.698 --> 02:47.490
in park management. And he wrote a letter up here to 
the admissions office saying that he would like to

02:48.551 --> 03:00.985
come for a graduate degree, but his handwriting 
has always been terrible. And they sent it to

03:01.690 --> 03:12.926
Animal Science because they thought he was 
interested in a graduate degree in pork

03:01.690 --> 03:12.926
management,

03:01.690 --> 03:12.926
rather than park management. So I thought that was 
kind of a cute thing. Another humorous thing that

03:18.874 --> 03:27.346
struck me was you were asking about faculty jokes 
and tricks and things of that kind. For years, we

03:29.229 --> 03:30.651
supported Texas Tech with that Southwestern Park 
and Recreation Administration conference

03:31.492 --> 03:40.922
training conference up at Texoma Lodge and uh... I 
would take a bunch of students upper level

03:41.143 --> 03:57.921
students and as many faculty as we could spare to go 
up there for that three or four days and eventually

03:41.143 --> 03:57.921
you know ran a good bit of the program but uh... our 
fellas being Texans, outdoorsmen like to go

03:58.508 --> 04:09.194
fishing and one time I came back into the room and 
they were all there, we were having a little

03:58.508 --> 04:09.194
conference. I went into the bathroom there took a 
few minutes out, got up off the toilet and just let

04:14.101 --> 04:28.584
out a shriek and everybody convulsed with 
laughter because they had put about an 18 inch

04:14.101 --> 04:28.584
white bass

04:14.101 --> 04:28.584
in the toilet. So we did have a certain amount of 
those practical jokes going on from time to time.

04:39.001 --> 04:41.425
Something that's given me probably A continuing 
pleasure over the last few years has been

04:43.075 --> 05:02.623
something that I was allowed to try here that was a 
real success and largely with the help of John

04:43.075 --> 05:02.623
Blackburn that taught here for about 14 years and 
is now director of community services down in

04:43.075 --> 05:02.623
Bryan. He taught our facilities, park facilities 
and maintenance courses and when they were going

05:04.746 --> 05:12.778
to build the baseball complex. You may remember 
there used to be a farm caretaker on that property

05:17.114 --> 05:22.476
on little six acres there. And I got upset. with the 
fact that while they were building that complex,

05:27.676 --> 05:37.875
they had allowed the trucks and the diesel fuel 
storage tanks and stuff under those big oak trees

05:27.676 --> 05:37.875
over there. And I said, you know, I don't know if it 
was somebody in the physical plant that I went and

05:38.797 --> 05:50.038
complained to, you're going to kill all those 
trees with that oil seepage around the tree roots.

05:50.963 --> 05:58.171
At that time, I had an adjunct landscape architect 
on deferred duty here from the National Park

05:50.963 --> 05:58.171
Service named Dave Torello. And with him, we 
developed a proposal to turn that little six acre

05:59.412 --> 06:09.162
grove, oak grove, into a park. And the original 
idea was to make a place where the roads wound, a

06:09.182 --> 06:17.511
road wound through that oak grove It matured from 
that or changed from that into the idea of getting

06:18.588 --> 06:40.108
the physical plant to let us have the south end of 
that parking lot and restripe it so that it would

06:18.588 --> 06:40.108
accommodate up to 60-foot mobile home coaches 
down the south end and up the east end of that, 44.

06:40.228 --> 06:47.194
And then John Blackburn, when it was approved by 
the physical plant, John Blackburn took that plan

06:47.545 --> 07:12.405
implemented it and this physical plant put in 
underground water and electricity for us and then

06:47.545 --> 07:12.405
Pat Olson gave us $5,000 to build a shelter with ice 
machines and coke machines and stuff and in the

06:47.545 --> 07:12.405
picnic facilities and that that little thing 
developed into a probably one of the best public

07:12.740 --> 07:17.404
relations things that I know about on campus. We 
ran it on a fee basis with a two-week maximum to stay

07:18.846 --> 07:24.751
there. As I remember, it was $15.

07:31.297 --> 07:42.527
And the idea was to make it available to parents and 
families that wanted to come to ball games,

07:31.297 --> 07:42.527
football games, baseball games, or to visit 
students here. and give them a nice place to park

07:44.060 --> 07:50.309
this because we really haven't got a first-class 
RV park in town. And we opened them up July 1st for

07:51.531 --> 08:00.243
reservations for the various weekends, kind of a 
first-come, first-served. And I don't know how

08:01.164 --> 08:08.515
many letters we got that had a $20 or a $50 and one 
time a $100 bill with a letter from these folks

08:09.018 --> 08:13.165
saying, this is the greatest thing A&M has ever 
done. We appreciate so much being able to come and

08:13.205 --> 08:17.131
stay overnight and stuff like this. After I 
retired, Bonickson, who was the first department

08:18.233 --> 08:35.380
head after me, said all of that kind of stuff, 
maintenance and facilities, was not college

08:18.233 --> 08:35.380
level activity. our students had built this stuff 
so they were getting a lot of experience out of it.

08:39.248 --> 08:40.590
But he said no, he didn't like that. So he turned it 
back to the physical plant. But every time I go

08:43.814 --> 09:02.700
around that corner on Welburn I get just a glow of 
personal satisfaction to see that and I've often

08:43.814 --> 09:02.700
thought sometime if it has to be after I'm dead I 
hope they put the L. Reed designation on that

08:43.814 --> 09:02.700
little corner because that's provided a lot of 
pleasure for people that came to visit. That's a

09:06.108 --> 09:07.110
splendid idea. Well, I wanted to do another one 
with about 60 sites, RV sites over on the north

09:07.991 --> 09:18.326
side, closer to where the peach orchard used to be. 
Feeling that was convenient to the football

09:19.628 --> 09:23.073
thing, too. But the research park took that out, 
and then the airport entrance did a lot of that too,

09:32.195 --> 09:39.685
because there weren't very many sites over there 
that were level enough to take a big, you know, who

09:32.195 --> 09:39.685
would have needed about eight acres. Anyhow, the 
little one has worked and has been nice and

09:40.546 --> 09:44.071
convenient there. The other thing I didn't 
mention was that I guess I was thirty-six,

09:46.734 --> 09:57.609
thirty-five or thirty-six when I came here to 
start this thing. And because we had early on these

10:01.962 --> 10:19.562
senior profs that were 15, 20 years older than I 
was, a

10:01.962 --> 10:19.562
lot of our grad students were older than I was, 
which was kind of an unusual thing. Because we were

10:20.162 --> 10:25.388
turning out a lot of Ph.D.s initially that were 
mid-career and they'd either have enough time in

10:26.515 --> 10:38.932
service with their agency to have a sabbatical or a 
semester off or a year off and probably their only

10:26.515 --> 10:38.932
opportunity to get a terminal degree. That's my 
agenda. I'm caught up with you again. Let's see,

10:45.121 --> 10:51.510
who were the key departmental staff people that 
are worthy of words of appreciation,

10:52.537 --> 10:58.825
secretaries, other key staff people in the 
department? Do I need to name them by name? Well,

11:00.807 --> 11:04.672
some of them will.

11:05.032 --> 11:08.997
The first one probably sticks in my mind was Hazel 
Grubbs. And her husband was in the physical plan.

11:13.863 --> 11:21.092
And Hazel was a very good-looking woman.

11:24.110 --> 11:31.701
I think was, I won't say a party girl, but enjoyed 
good times and good events. And maybe our

11:31.821 --> 11:38.471
department was a little too prosaic for her 
because she went, who did she go eventually to work

11:31.821 --> 11:38.471
for? She transferred to Jackie Sherrill? I 
believe so. And went as his department secretary

11:43.598 --> 11:50.488
before he left to go wherever it was, Alabama or 
Mississippi. Mississippi State. Yeah. But Hazel

11:53.202 --> 11:59.852
did a lot of the initial organizing and setting up. 
When I got there, I had to lobby long and hard to get

11:59.872 --> 12:04.360
her an electric typewriter. There were, you know, 
it seems funny now, but I guess we are talking back

12:04.400 --> 12:16.138
35 years, and we were into electric typewriters at 
Michigan State. But not here. And they told me, you

12:20.287 --> 12:24.071
should have been here just a few years ago. We 
didn't hardly have any air conditioning on this

12:24.131 --> 12:26.953
campus. And that

12:27.053 --> 12:33.099
wasn't air conditioning at MSU either. But then we 
didn't have the climate that they had here. It must

12:35.521 --> 12:41.326
have been intolerable to have that kind of a 
situation. What about other departmental staff

12:41.666 --> 12:46.851
people, the implementers of policy?

12:50.678 --> 13:00.968
We had such a tremendous number of people going 
through all with their own personalities and

12:50.678 --> 13:00.968
incarnations. It's

13:01.509 --> 13:08.816
kind of hard to single them out, to ask who was doing 
what. As you look back, given the clarity of

13:10.078 --> 13:19.487
hindsight, are there any missed opportunities 
for this program? things that might have been done

13:21.880 --> 13:25.526
if we had known then what we know now?

13:32.278 --> 13:34.402
I can probably think of several, given a moment. 
One of the big disappointments to me was that when I

13:34.542 --> 13:46.183
came here there was an institute of natural 
biosciences, which is about as redundant as

13:34.542 --> 13:46.183
saying pizza pie.

13:50.382 --> 14:06.248
And there was a movement with Lineweber and 
Schuster and Tier and I to develop that into an

13:50.382 --> 14:06.248
actual school.

14:10.430 --> 14:19.702
of natural resources, which is comparable to 
those you mentioned, Cornell and Michigan State

14:10.430 --> 14:19.702
and so on, Ohio State. Never could get that done. 
Pretty difficult for four departments to

14:25.389 --> 14:39.087
overcome the doubts and fears of eight or nine 
other departments when you're carrying 30% of the

14:25.389 --> 14:39.087
votes. And so we never were able to do that. And 
without that visibility,

14:43.175 --> 14:50.325
it was just impossible to do. And now they're doing 
it again, I noticed. Over there, Bob Brown in

14:53.489 --> 14:59.877
wildlife is chairing a committee to develop a 
school. And I think they're going to have the same

15:01.628 --> 15:17.038
difficulty we had, which is even as department 
heads, we wanted a school, but we didn't want to

15:01.628 --> 15:17.038
interpose a next higher level person between 
ourselves and the dean. We wanted direct personal

15:17.078 --> 15:23.350
access to the dean, but we wanted still some 
figurehead that would to coalesce these four

15:24.292 --> 15:27.256
departments into a unit. I think if they're able to 
figure out how to do that, they'll probably get it

15:28.237 --> 15:32.443
done. But it's...

15:33.524 --> 15:40.353
You know, I love this school. I've spent my life 
here, my career here. I'm loyal to it. But I

15:45.260 --> 15:49.405
honestly think over the years, A&M has been its own 
worst enemy.

15:53.097 --> 15:55.340
You probably haven't heard that from anybody 
else. How so? Where? Well, I was pretty close at one

15:58.324 --> 16:08.579
time with Alexander, what was his first name, who 
was a vice president of TU.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.147
Lou, I'll be with you in a bit. Are you going to be 
around a while?

16:21.008 --> 16:30.722
He and I were on a panel with the National Research 
Council doing a water quality study and they

16:21.008 --> 16:30.722
wanted a recreational input into the water study. 
So we were at Woods Hole for a while and talking

16:30.762 --> 16:36.030
about the schools.

16:38.774 --> 16:44.623
And I sensed a different flavor at Texas than here. 
Maybe I was just beginning to be frustrated here. I

16:49.329 --> 16:50.391
don't know. The same thing happened

16:51.518 --> 17:00.295
with who?

17:04.604 --> 17:09.493
I've lost the train of thought, Haskell.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.527
missed opportunities, lost opportunities you 
were talking about. Yeah, but between UT and here,

17:15.048 --> 17:18.654
I know. We had for a while a Texas University fellow 
that taught in the Lyndon School, Lyndon Johnson

17:20.436 --> 17:27.467
School. I team taught a course with him, a graduate 
course. And so that was the closest I ever became to

17:37.064 --> 17:43.852
understanding some of the internal philosophies 
of Texas University. And it seemed like, and I

17:44.693 --> 18:01.772
can't remember his name, he was in our local Rotary 
Club after he moved over here, that the attitude,

17:44.693 --> 18:01.772
this is an oversimplification, at Texas was, hey, 
that's never been done, let's do it. And the

18:02.191 --> 18:05.236
attitude here was, hey, that's never been done. Is 
somebody forcing us to do that?

18:09.963 --> 18:15.492
That's a pretty rotten non-Christian knock 
against my own school. But time and time again,

18:15.592 --> 18:24.806
when something radically different was 
proposed, it seemed to be, well, is somebody

18:15.592 --> 18:24.806
pushing this? Have we got to do this? Or can we get 
along without it? Do you remember any time when we

18:30.558 --> 18:37.330
lost a real key person from Recreation and Parks? 
We had them and then we lost them. Well, for a number

18:43.520 --> 18:44.682
of reasons. We lost, we had a key person and he was a 
young man when he died, Frank Suggett that I

18:44.783 --> 18:51.975
mentioned. that had been my department head at 
Michigan State. He didn't want to be an

18:55.105 --> 18:56.667
administrator. He fought against it. And the dean 
wouldn't let him out of it. He appointed me acting

19:02.434 --> 19:14.689
head as the youngest, most junior instructor at 
that time while I was working on my PhD, simply

19:02.434 --> 19:14.689
because he didn't want to report anymore. And 
that's how I became so close to the dean up there.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.724
who gave me a lot of advice about coming to A&M. And 
then Suggett came down here. And I hired Suggett

19:23.746 --> 19:27.210
here as the first full prof. And he came down here. 
That helped me more than anything because being

19:28.391 --> 19:40.644
young and raw, I had two senior people a decade 
older than me to kind of soften this brashness. And

19:40.764 --> 19:48.692
Claire Gunn and Frank Suggett were so excellent 
because they were polar. Whatever one of them

19:49.077 --> 19:54.185
committed himself to first, the other one would 
take the opposite side. And I had the advantage of

19:54.846 --> 20:00.275
weighing those two things because they would 
never agree on anything. And the loss, we lost him?

20:01.857 --> 20:11.793
We lost Suggett because he was a great extension 
man and he liked going out with these communities,

20:01.857 --> 20:11.793
Oliver and Goliad or wherever. He'd go and talk to 
people. He was... uh... so smart in an unorthodox

20:16.010 --> 20:30.880
way of looking at things and he bought a motor coach 
and he'd take students out on field trips to see at

20:16.010 --> 20:30.880
first hand these things and he was driving back 
from one of those and went to sleep at the wheel and

20:31.653 --> 20:49.662
in Caldwell he ran off the road and hit an entrance 
driveway culvert and rolled he laid there with a

20:31.653 --> 20:49.662
broken back all night until somebody found him in 
the morning and over that period of maybe a year

20:49.642 --> 20:57.371
taking pain medicine and alcohol just took him 
down. And finally, his wife and I had to commit him

20:58.052 --> 21:04.079
for a short period of time. And he kind of wrote his 
life story while he was locked up there, but he died

21:05.380 --> 21:11.448
shortly afterwards. And I think that was a real 
loss. We hired another person, Neal Cheek, who was

21:19.544 --> 21:23.891
one of the most intelligent people we ever had on 
the faculty. He came as a full professor. He was a

21:26.354 --> 21:32.103
structural sociologist.

21:33.505 --> 21:42.639
He was also the most divisive man I ever had on the 
faculty because he would never take charge of

21:33.505 --> 21:42.639
anything, but he wanted to be the power behind the 
throne. Invisible, but directing what I was going

21:43.340 --> 21:46.345
to Decide deviously so he was always organizing 
Groups within the faculty to try and promote

21:47.371 --> 22:15.049
something that he wanted to have done, but he 
wouldn't come forward and Tell me what you know

21:47.371 --> 22:15.049
argue his own case and he finally left and that was I 
don't know if it was because of the department

21:47.371 --> 22:15.049
situation or because he Finally washed up his 
marriage with his wife and they split and then he

21:47.371 --> 22:15.049
left So those were two real bright people that we 
lost in the department. When you were getting

22:19.931 --> 22:27.338
ready to make an important decision and you wanted 
any kind of advice and counsel, to whom did you

22:19.931 --> 22:27.338
turn?

22:32.503 --> 22:44.935
I tried to turn to the whole faculty, but if it was 
kind of a private thing, first of all, I think any

22:32.503 --> 22:44.935
administrator needs a sounding board. Now who was 
your sounding board? Lou Hodges. Lou Hodges,

22:49.722 --> 23:02.019
partly because he'd been around so long, partly 
because he was initially as a young man very shy,

22:49.722 --> 23:02.019
and also because he was close-lipped and would 
keep a confidence. But I think everybody needs

23:02.059 --> 23:08.728
somebody, either a wife at home or somebody in the 
department, that you can just unload on and rant

23:09.164 --> 23:37.264
and rave and get angry and or seek sympathy or 
wisdom or something you know not necessarily a

23:09.164 --> 23:37.264
decision but just somebody to that'll listen to 
you and you always had direct entree to the dean's

23:09.164 --> 23:37.264
office oh yeah yeah and that was that was very good i 
presume yeah yeah well let's see uh shift to humor

23:37.447 --> 23:42.471
Do you remember any time the students ever 
attempted any jokes or pranks in class? Like in my

23:44.113 --> 23:50.118
class one day, a student wouldn't know if he was to 
turn his tickets in with his final exam. And I said,

23:50.138 --> 23:50.898
tickets? Tickets for what? Well, exam tickets. I 
said, what do you mean? Last night, sir, a

23:54.361 --> 24:00.146
sophomore was over in our core dorm selling $5 
tickets to take final exams, and I bought a ticket.

24:03.489 --> 24:06.812
Do you remember any good bull like that, the 
students, anywhere?

24:10.488 --> 24:14.071
Well, what are my initials? LMR, right? For years, 
the students behind my back, but never let me know

24:17.554 --> 24:23.119
it, was they'd call me Elmer. I don't know if that 
was good or bad, but that was the code word for the

24:25.501 --> 24:31.966
department head.

24:34.889 --> 24:40.073
When we were in the horse barn, and we were very 
close with our grad students and faculty, I taught

24:34.889 --> 24:40.073
a graduate seminar on administrative style if you 
want to call it that you know conduct behavior

24:40.357 --> 25:08.895
whatever and I guess I really ragged the students 
and I always tried to be one of the bananas in the

24:40.357 --> 25:08.895
bunch okay but yeah you can't be Casco you know that 
there's a mantle of of leadership that keeps

25:09.162 --> 25:15.289
people at a distance, even if you want to be 
friendly. In fact, while we were in the horse barn,

25:15.990 --> 25:30.407
a big fellow by the name of Steve Smith came around 
the corner and ran into me, and we kind of both

25:15.990 --> 25:30.407
apologized at the same instant. Our grad students 
were upstairs in that loft, in that horse barn, and

25:30.508 --> 25:38.477
he apologized and turned on his heel and ran up the 
stairs and I heard him shouting to the other grad

25:38.930 --> 25:48.502
students as he ran up the stairs, I called him Les, I 
called him Les. There was that little bit of

25:50.344 --> 25:56.292
familiarity that I guess wasn't used there. But I 
had one student in that group and there were about

25:56.312 --> 26:03.101
10 of them that were really close and thick. Some 
were Texans, some were not, played golf a lot

26:03.121 --> 26:06.625
together. And this particular guy has been head 
of, well, he's not now, but he was head of the

26:07.583 --> 26:16.753
University of Arizona department, A.J. Haley, 
Arthur Haley, for about 14 years, and he built a

26:16.813 --> 26:24.441
real fine program out there. Anyway, he's a black 
Irishman from some Quincy, Massachusetts, a

26:25.862 --> 26:37.354
suburb of Boston, I guess, and he's as Irish, black 
Irish as you can get. irreverent as hell and I had

26:37.874 --> 27:01.738
been talking a previous seminar night about the 
importance of demeanor if you want to be regarded

26:37.874 --> 27:01.738
as well regarded in a meeting you you sit forward 
like you got a bad case of piles you don't slouch

26:37.874 --> 27:01.738
back and you know all this kind of stuff And dress is 
important, and tie is important, and how you speak

27:01.718 --> 27:15.177
is important, and these things, not only the 
message you're carrying, but how you present it.

27:15.317 --> 27:30.578
Well, the next seminar class, I came into the 
conference room we had, which held about 15 or 18 of

27:15.317 --> 27:30.578
these grad student guys, because at that time we 
were all male. There was just a Twitter. Everybody

27:34.609 --> 27:35.771
was Twittering. And I looked around, what the heck 
is going on here? And A.J. Haley was dressed in the

27:39.556 --> 27:46.306
most god-awful costume that you ever saw. I just 
can't describe it. It looked like Hatfield and

27:49.531 --> 27:52.134
McCoy hayseed. He had a big old floppy felt hat down 
here and a great big peacock feather in it. I mean,

27:57.762 --> 28:00.987
he was just going to put me on. And that's one of 
those times where it just brought down the house.

28:05.805 --> 28:08.428
But we used that to pretty good effect. There's 
another time, and this is not so funny, about the

28:09.609 --> 28:17.077
time that long hair was coming into fashion. And 
one of the grad students I had, he was real bright,

28:17.717 --> 28:23.544
and I'd brought him down from the University of 
Michigan. He'd finished a good master's there,

28:23.824 --> 28:27.868
and I wanted him to do a PhD with us. And he came out 
with this long bearded thing. And it happened that

28:35.840 --> 28:39.904
that semester he was redheaded and he had a red 
beard. And he was really testing me and, you know, I

28:41.326 --> 28:53.139
can have hair if I wanted and you, you know, you 
can't do anything about it. And so we were

28:53.239 --> 28:58.665
scheduling a symposium and bringing in a number of 
national people as lead speakers in this thing, a

28:59.050 --> 29:03.737
spring symposium. And so I was giving out 
assignments to different ones, who could go to the

29:03.757 --> 29:18.037
airport and pick up one plane load at a certain time 
and who would drive a car and who would do this and

29:03.757 --> 29:18.037
who would do that. And this Jim, after all the 
assignments were made, he said, and what do you

29:19.039 --> 29:25.989
want me to do? I said, I want you to stay out of sight. 
He said, what are you talking about? I said, I don't

29:31.623 --> 29:36.428
want you around these people looking like you do 
with that beard. And he said, that's my

29:37.510 --> 29:39.993
prerogative to wear a beard. And I said, it's my 
prerogative to decide that I don't want you around

29:40.113 --> 29:43.918
those people. Well, I guess that's not very good of 
me to say that, but... That's the way I felt. I agree

29:53.715 --> 29:55.678
with you. I agree with you. Let's see. Any personal 
experiences where you, particularly as a

29:59.884 --> 30:09.777
newcomer, had trouble pronouncing a Texas place 
or person or a name? Yeah. Yeah. And I want to add

30:12.721 --> 30:15.305
another thing about that, too. Well, the first 
thing I want to do is this young fellow that I hired

30:15.325 --> 30:21.994
as the first instructor, Carol Dowell, from He had 
been community parks director in Bossier City and

30:22.683 --> 30:29.051
was now at LSU. He came over and he took me on some of 
my early wanderings around Texas. One day we

30:34.258 --> 30:43.189
decided to attend, we made arrangements to attend 
a bi-state meeting in Alexandria, Louisiana.

30:44.071 --> 30:48.336
This was just a couple months after I'd been here. 
took my big station wagon that I still had, drove

30:48.822 --> 30:57.114
out east across Conroe and Huntsville and Lake 
Livingston, cut and shoot. First time I'd seen cut

30:57.214 --> 30:58.596
and shoot. And we got over there somewhere in East 
Texas, decided to stop and get a drink,

30:59.898 --> 31:10.493
non-alcoholic.
