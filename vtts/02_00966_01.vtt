00:06.410 --> 00:14.841
This is an interview with Craig Champion by Susan 
Turgeon on November 26, 1988, at Craig Champion's

00:06.410 --> 00:14.841
home in Grosbeck, Texas, concerning the Vietnam 
War. In the interest of accumulating knowledge

00:15.782 --> 00:23.172
about the war, I'm going to donate this type to the 
Texas A&M oral history collection in the

00:15.782 --> 00:23.172
university archives. Is that all right with you? 
Yes. Were you drafted or did you enlist?

00:32.645 --> 00:33.446
Volunteer. Volunteer. Out of high school,

00:34.000 --> 00:47.233
or how old were you then? I was 19. Did you have any 
thoughts? I mean, did you really know what was

00:50.456 --> 00:56.142
going on over there, or what we were fighting for? 
Not really. In high school, I don't think that

00:56.462 --> 01:00.226
nobody really gave Vietnam a thought. And right 
out of high school, I went to Prairie Game College.

01:01.807 --> 01:02.708
Right out of school, I went to summer school. And

01:03.548 --> 01:16.300
still haven't given the first

01:03.548 --> 01:16.300
thought. Maybe it crossed my mind some, but that's 
a long one. We have everybody. Talked about, in the

01:21.525 --> 01:25.509
year 66, year after, talked about joining the 
Marine Corps. But he might have been going on the

01:25.529 --> 01:26.530
police system. But I don't think he could pass the 
pistol, so I just put him on the police. Got a letter

01:30.754 --> 01:31.615
from the draft board. So I just went on down to

01:32.860 --> 01:42.312
the barbecue and kind of kicked it up. Really 
didn't know what was going on until you got in the

01:42.372 --> 01:48.900
Army and then they let you know what the question 
was. Did they tell you about the politics and

01:48.920 --> 01:51.683
everything? I mean, did you know what you were 
fighting for while you were there? No, it was about

01:55.728 --> 01:59.773
the only thing the Army basic training would tell 
you. It was communism. Nothing in detail. and how

02:01.430 --> 02:10.060
we got over there and why we went over there. Did 
they train you militarily adequately for when you

02:10.080 --> 02:20.813
got there for the kind of war that it was? The 
training, was it appropriate because it was a

02:20.993 --> 02:25.879
guerrilla war? Well, it's kind of hard to train for 
that really. I guess we went through the standard

02:29.263 --> 02:31.285
basic training. Uh, AIT, I was a combat medic.

02:42.551 --> 02:48.921
I went through a medical training for eight months 
before I went over. And, uh, I was just working in

02:48.941 --> 02:52.345
the hospital. And I dealt with a lot of, uh, wounded 
Vietnam boys coming back from the Iranian farm.

02:57.212 --> 03:02.520
And, uh, of course, I, I got, uh, pretty well 
informed on what was going over, you know, before I

02:57.212 --> 03:02.520
got there. But

03:03.260 --> 03:30.607
as

03:03.260 --> 03:30.607
far as what kind of action he was going to see when he 
got over there, it depended on where they sent you.

03:30.627 --> 03:30.968
What's it called? The Highlands, you know, the 
Delta, Acon. I got sent to the Acon Delta. You

03:35.997 --> 03:47.742
didn't see much action with what's called a 
regular army, mostly up north until 10. Most of our

03:47.762 --> 03:54.175
combat time was spent fighting snipers. It

03:54.644 --> 04:16.045
kind of reminded

03:54.644 --> 04:16.045
me of the cowboy and Indian day, you know, the 
cowboy riding through and Indians waiting on them

03:54.644 --> 04:16.045
as they stopped to pick them up. And putting up the 
booty traps. So it was always the unexpected you

04:17.226 --> 04:20.750
had to be ready for. Where were you stationed over 
there? Base camp was a place called Dome Town. And

04:25.407 --> 04:33.915
when I got there, they attached me to what's called 
a mobile riverine force. And they put us on a ship

04:34.616 --> 04:41.983
that was anchored in the Mekong Harbor Bay. And 
they had what's called ATCs on personnel carriers

04:42.644 --> 04:48.350
and Navy around. And they'd load us up on those 
grassroots early in the morning before daybreak.

04:50.952 --> 04:52.714
And we grew up in these clouds. and then they'd turn 
in the beach and we had to unload straight into the

04:53.504 --> 05:16.643
jungle and we may walk anywhere from a day to two 
weeks before we came back before helicopters came

04:53.504 --> 05:16.643
in and picked us up but we came back around to the 
river so when we went out you really didn't know how

04:53.504 --> 05:16.643
long we were going to be out When you went out there, 
what was your mission?

05:30.034 --> 05:37.523
Just to find Cypress, or?

05:37.543 --> 05:43.250
They had titles called Search and Destroy,

05:37.543 --> 05:43.250
Ambush Patrol, and just Recon. Most of them were 
just Search and Destroy missions. Maybe get a tip

05:45.453 --> 05:46.494
from one of the civilians, whatever. That's it. 
Maybe a bunker full

05:47.065 --> 06:00.783
of guns or grenades or whatever in this village. If 
it looked like it was D.C. controlled, the way you

06:01.764 --> 06:11.757
could tell that was by the amount of rice they had 
stored in the underground tunnels that they built

06:01.764 --> 06:11.757
in the bunkers inside the hoochies. You

06:12.158 --> 06:37.004
can go down in those things and if they were pretty 
well fortified, lots of blankets and first aid

06:12.158 --> 06:37.004
equipment, you knew it was probably at least easy 
to get behind the camp and build those places up and

06:12.158 --> 06:37.004
come and get down. A lot of times you wouldn't get 
the right one until, you know, a lot of people suck

06:37.024 --> 06:39.887
at being civilian and I'm just part of being in a war 
area. How

06:40.070 --> 07:02.997
did

06:40.070 --> 07:02.997
the people at Church of the Reign meet people that 
you encountered? About as well as you treat them.

07:03.678 --> 07:04.859
If you treated them like human beings, they liked 
the GI. Of course, there's always ones that, you

07:04.879 --> 07:06.661
know, the police would like to push them around. 
And I've always thought that Somebody

07:09.162 --> 07:20.193
pushed one around, and they got word to the Fiat 
car. And the smart people, the real smart people,

07:20.213 --> 07:27.060
said they could pick him out. The sniper could pick 
him out and be the first one to go down. I couldn't

07:30.643 --> 07:32.785
prove that, but I've seen it happen. A guy that 
just, let's say a bully may steal a coat or

07:32.925 --> 07:38.511
something, a coat leg, an old thing that had been 
stolen. little baskets on the pole and they'd run

07:39.014 --> 07:46.342
down to the paddy bikes. Sometimes they'd run 
right up to you in a firefight. Of course, we

07:50.086 --> 07:54.351
wouldn't be following them. And I'd try to sell you 
a coat. And somebody, you know, steal a little old

07:56.514 --> 08:00.778
lady's coat or something like that. That's an 
explanation of how they did it a couple months ago.

08:04.681 --> 08:24.141
uh,

08:04.681 --> 08:24.141
ironic

08:04.681 --> 08:24.141
or whatever, but I've always

08:04.681 --> 08:24.141
thought that they had a lot of ties with the Viet 
Cong. You know, uh, they're sons, cousins or

08:24.161 --> 08:26.603
whatever, you know. And, uh, but they, uh, the Viet 
Cong, you know, they were, uh, mostly civilians in

08:26.623 --> 08:33.490
the daytime, plowing or whatever, and then, uh, 
they'd either drop a plow to get to AK-47 or, during

08:33.858 --> 08:45.255
the daytime

08:33.858 --> 08:45.255
or most times at night times. Did you fight any with 
Arlen, please? Yeah, yeah. What kind

08:50.443 --> 08:55.231
of fighters were those? I've heard we've had 
people come and talk to us and we've had

08:55.251 --> 08:57.815
discrepancies report. They're another group. I 
think a lot of it's too dependent on what outfit and

08:58.295 --> 09:00.118
who trained them. A

09:00.352 --> 09:18.366
good trained orbit outfit I've seen by a great, 
great majority of them, in my opinion. Just

09:18.386 --> 09:18.907
cracked a little bit. They'd wear their little 
silk headscarves, or blue scarves, or green

09:18.927 --> 09:21.191
scarves, whatever outfit they were with. Didn't 
see a lot of them actually. You

09:23.740 --> 09:42.272
think we should have given them more 
responsibility? worked more closely with them

09:43.332 --> 10:01.310
and trained them into their job instead of, it 
seemed like we went over there and we took care of

09:43.332 --> 10:01.310
everything and they were just kind of on the side. 
Yeah, that's basically the way it was. I don't even

10:05.094 --> 10:10.479
know, I don't think that we would have given them 
any more authority whether they would have

10:05.094 --> 10:10.479
handled the situation. It would have been a bigger 
mess. If

10:13.049 --> 10:32.041
Washington would have just let the army do their 
job over there, it would have been over a hundred

10:13.049 --> 10:32.041
times better. You think the war could have been won 
if it had been fought differently? Sure. A lot of

10:33.644 --> 10:34.405
people got wealthy back here. And that's the 
expense of a lot of young men. But I never gave that

10:37.012 --> 10:47.422
much thought while I was over there.

10:47.802 --> 10:54.768
That was only after I got back and, you know, years 
later. It seems like just in the past few years that

10:54.788 --> 10:59.072
the Vietnam Air experience, you know, is coming 
back. And the movies, you know, you read a lot about

10:59.092 --> 11:02.395
it and you can't pick up the paper. I'm just now kind 
of digging into the heart of it. But at that time in

11:04.898 --> 11:06.259
68, I didn't

11:06.880 --> 11:21.175
care

11:06.880 --> 11:21.175
less about politics. I went over because I

11:21.195 --> 11:26.000
was, you know, for my country. As corny as it seems, 
that's why I was there. And I was ready to give

11:26.941 --> 11:27.802
everything I had. Do you think the government 
betrayed you now that you know that they weren't

11:27.822 --> 11:33.748
doing everything they could and you were over 
there trying to give it your all? I

11:35.872 --> 11:59.621
never thought of it as betraying me, but I guess you 
could look at it like that. Of course, I don't hold

11:59.641 --> 12:01.363
many grudges with any of them, because I don't even 
know them. And I often thought that it was all to do

12:01.383 --> 12:03.365
over again, though I don't know how would I have 
done it. I'm not so sure I would. I'm not so sure I

12:03.886 --> 12:04.486
would leave. It was just too costly. They're

12:05.453 --> 12:28.740
alive. The money is left. It's alive. Did you have 
buddies that didn't come back that were killed

12:29.380 --> 12:30.802
over there? Yeah, that's it. Of course, you got to 
pay a lot of money in the medics. Yeah. Yeah, I was

12:32.404 --> 12:33.285
just about 12, 100% of the time. I had a lot of them. A 
couple wounded, enough to come back. I lost one

12:34.506 --> 12:35.207
today where they're at . I

12:35.812 --> 12:52.077
don't

12:35.812 --> 12:52.077
know. I don't know. I know some of them are fine. I 
know one was paralyzed and was shot in the spine.

12:57.666 --> 12:59.048
I'm also one that's definitely on the back. You 
haven't seen any of them since you went in there?

13:00.150 --> 13:01.171
The only contact I've made was with my best friend. 
He was blown up by a claymore monster. He was from El

13:01.972 --> 13:02.393
Campo. And

13:03.149 --> 13:27.479
he was at the hospital, San Antonio, about a year. I 
had about three months left in the country when he

13:27.499 --> 13:28.781
was killed. I wrote his fiancee and his mom and dad, 
and they got back in contact with me, and we

13:28.801 --> 13:30.783
corresponded. And when I got back, I drove to San 
Antonio to stay in contact with him. He

13:34.402 --> 13:58.719
was a pretty big old boy and he messed up pretty good 
and lost an eye and got a steel plate in his head and

13:34.402 --> 13:58.719
the rest of it kind of looks like hamburgers. He 
came through it pretty well. He got married and got

13:59.380 --> 14:00.382
his degree in oceanography. I hadn't heard from 
him in five or six years. So

14:01.587 --> 14:25.933
as far as I know, he's the one that scarred that. The 
news coverage that was covered by TV, do you think a

14:25.953 --> 14:27.595
lot of that was accurate? that was

14:28.705 --> 14:37.395
portrayed back over here. Did you ever work with a

14:37.415 --> 14:46.086
news team? Yeah, we had a news week that followed us 
for about 60 days. And on this educational

14:48.749 --> 14:55.337
channel, when they had this Vietnam stuff going 
on, I'm not real sure, but I think I saw a shot.

14:56.110 --> 15:15.895
Captions

14:56.110 --> 15:15.895
of who it was, a lot of food, just tapes and bits and 
pieces from a lot of correspondence. Well, yeah, a

15:15.915 --> 15:19.840
lot of it had to be because it was live. The camera 
was, you know, they had it there rolling. You think

15:20.922 --> 15:22.123
that should have been shown back over here? I don't 
know.

15:25.557 --> 15:32.504
I

15:25.557 --> 15:32.504
know my mom and dad, they kept up with us pretty 
close. Dad moved and went out and bought a huge,

15:34.787 --> 15:47.680
wild Vietnam map, and I'd write a letter and tell 
him, you know, where we were going on this next

15:34.787 --> 15:47.680
operation, or where we'd been, and what we were 
doing before then. He'd get out, and I noticed he

15:47.700 --> 15:51.745
had it all marked on the map. It was about every 
place that I drove and told him where we'd been on

15:51.765 --> 15:53.927
the population, so he kept up with me.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.708
I don't know. I think maybe it helped them to... I 
think in the back of their mind, they really knew

16:06.837 --> 16:11.005
what was going on in there. I think maybe the TV 
coverage kind of helped them. I'd want to know what

16:15.053 --> 16:17.337
my son was. There was a lot, maybe a lot of school, 
you know, battle on the TV. Were

16:21.515 --> 16:49.345
you out of one of your tears, did you? What's your 
opinion about that? Do you think that they should

16:54.051 --> 17:11.122
have been longer tours or do you think that by the 
time you got over there, well, we've been told that

16:54.051 --> 17:11.122
you got over there and you had like, by the time you 
got out in the field, you had like six months just to

16:54.051 --> 17:11.122
get out in the field because you went to Vietnam and 
then you got your orders and you went to Saigon for a

16:54.051 --> 17:11.122
while and then you got shipped out. Do you think you 
were there long enough to have an impact for just

17:11.142 --> 17:14.067
one year? Or do you think it should have been... 
Because I said, people I've talked to said that,

17:14.047 --> 17:32.326
like, by the time you have, like, three months 
left, well, you're not worried about anything but

17:14.047 --> 17:32.326
getting back alive, mainly. You know, that you're 
just, you're ready to go home. And you're not so

17:35.549 --> 17:40.634
much concerned about fighting, you're just 
really worried about keeping yourself alive.

17:40.654 --> 17:40.754
Yeah. What they call getting sharp. And where it 
will last, I guess, 90 days. I mean... It kind of

17:44.101 --> 17:47.885
weighs on your mind. You don't want to blow it. This 
late in the game, you want to get out of it. But I've

18:01.758 --> 18:05.942
always felt like that the more careful you try to be 
when you get shortest window, you're going to mess

18:01.758 --> 18:05.942
up. I don't know. I think I lived the last day the 
same as I lived the first day. I came close a lot of

18:11.888 --> 18:12.489
times. Black Jackets stopped a lot of them. and

18:15.623 --> 18:32.125
fragments, a lot of bullets close by when it 
reached right off the top of the field pocket, but

18:15.623 --> 18:32.125
never shed a drop of blood.

18:35.229 --> 18:36.450
It was bleached by an enemy. And I think it's just, 
you can't let it, you can't think about it, you

18:36.550 --> 18:41.236
can't let it bother you. You've just got to take it. 
take

18:42.860 --> 18:56.196
your destiny, whatever it's going to be, whatever 
it's going to be. Of course, that's not saying to be

18:56.216 --> 19:00.421
a hero, either. You can be a hero, but be smart. 
Somebody just jumping up and running into an area,

19:01.382 --> 19:05.067
he doesn't know where he's going. He probably 
won't come out. A smart way to do it and a dumb way to

19:07.250 --> 19:10.133
do it. As far as the time over

19:11.075 --> 19:22.233
there, I don't know. That place,

19:22.253 --> 19:30.766
a year is

19:22.253 --> 19:30.766
about all I think an average villa can take in 
certain areas. It was a whole different conflict.

19:32.742 --> 19:40.349
I call it a war. Anytime bullets are fired, I call it 
a war. That kicks me off when I read the amount of

19:51.440 --> 19:55.303
time for it. I know it wasn't declared, but they say 
it was a war, and I always did it. But that kite over

19:58.547 --> 20:01.129
there with the weather conditions, the elements, 
and the age of the GI over there, I think a year.

20:01.632 --> 20:16.666
That's

20:01.632 --> 20:16.666
about all they need to be able to do. And it's all 
what you want to

20:16.686 --> 20:23.593
make of it. Then the ones that are really into it and 
always volunteer for another tour do a lot of it.

20:26.436 --> 20:30.599
You can even volunteer for an extra three or four 
years in the Army on and out. I drafted for two

20:30.619 --> 20:31.200
years. And

20:32.176 --> 20:55.939
he just can't take it over there. He melts out. They 
volunteered for the next two or three or four years

20:56.239 --> 20:58.221
of Army life, and they made a big mistake. I'm going 
to have to comment on that. But I can hear this

20:59.002 --> 20:59.523
thing. You know, it's a choice. I've

21:00.340 --> 21:18.945
often wondered how, you know, World War II, that 
you went to the war they were with or you got in or

21:00.340 --> 21:18.945
whatever, where you killed and they came back. I 
just don't know. I think it would have been a lot

21:19.346 --> 21:20.127
worse. A lot of GIs over there took off anyway. In

21:21.772 --> 21:46.179
my own mind, a lot of these missions and actions, it 
never hurt them. I'm probably alive and well there

21:46.199 --> 21:47.280
somewhere right now. It just took off. It 
wouldn't. It was just, you know, it's what's been

21:47.921 --> 21:48.822
made. Were you involved with the Winning the 
Hearts of Minded People program? I think they had.

21:50.644 --> 21:51.745
But you were, you tried to be the Vietnamese friend 
who when

21:52.197 --> 22:04.308
you went into the village? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I never, 
uh, I never missed seeing any of the villagers. Uh,

22:12.175 --> 22:14.797
they liked me anyway because I was boxing about too 
many. Every one of them wanted a band-aid. Uh, the

22:15.558 --> 22:19.421
kids and the mommasides all come to you for those 
days and sit, um, and get half an aspirin and

22:15.558 --> 22:19.421
everything's all right. Put a band-aid on. Some of 
them did. and had no scars,

22:20.480 --> 22:31.738
infected scars, no medication. And you could 
really befriend them, at least in that way. You

22:35.524 --> 22:37.807
think that whole idea was even possible, really, 
though? With, I guess, the bad apples in your back?

22:39.289 --> 22:39.930
It was very difficult. You could go into, say, a 
village, uh you may leave that village and uh the

22:41.945 --> 23:06.923
old chief in the village he may say you know yeah as 
americans told you all right they were treated

22:41.945 --> 23:06.923
very even left their sea rashes whatever and then 
you walk out of the village and there's an old water

22:41.945 --> 23:06.923
buffalo and there's an old pot shot and you'll see 
what a m79 grenade launcher will do to a water

22:41.945 --> 23:06.923
buffalo and then you just go on Well,

23:07.493 --> 23:34.590
you've blown everything you've accomplished in 
that business, but it's hard to do because you're

23:07.493 --> 23:34.590
the ones that care less. How do things change for 
you at the Tech? Are they different for you? Yeah.

23:36.132 --> 23:36.673
It seems like the actual... The

23:37.666 --> 24:00.989
resistance that you met when you went out in the 
fields was like my own life. It was more just lots of

24:01.009 --> 24:02.110
walking, old boots and tracks. Not many knew it was 
being, you know, built. You can tell when one's

24:03.031 --> 24:05.073
been there, you don't know how much it's been 
built, how long it's been there. You've been there

24:05.093 --> 24:06.154
for 10 years, just firing each day. The

24:07.197 --> 24:23.641
Mac division,

24:07.197 --> 24:23.641
who I was with, we pretty well pushed the car, I say, 
pushed them out. Maybe we didn't. They just slowly

24:24.002 --> 24:25.324
quit fighting as much. And I say we didn't. We never 
did it like that much. I

24:29.168 --> 24:57.117
don't know if we did or not. I

24:59.257 --> 25:22.551
know after it was over with, I highly 
underestimated them. It was amazing, I think. A

25:23.072 --> 25:24.975
lot more than we could do with what we would have had 
to get in the same situation right now. They could

25:24.995 --> 25:26.057
take anything and make a person out of it. I don't 
think they were that brave as fighters. I think

25:27.038 --> 25:28.420
that they would get a trickier hit run and make them 
take it. take

25:29.564 --> 25:46.331
a bamboo sheet and make a mortar out of it. That kind 
of thing. It's a very beautiful thing. If anybody

25:47.333 --> 25:48.194
left behind, they could take it. What are the 
awards you're supposed to get from the Vietnamese

25:48.214 --> 25:49.697
government? What? That

25:51.839 --> 26:16.074
was their country's medal, their country's 
medal. I think it's their country's highest

26:16.094 --> 26:16.955
medal. In the United States, I think, probably 
equivalent to our DSC, but I don't know. The

26:18.597 --> 26:19.939
Congressional is our highest medal, so I don't 
know what it is. When

26:20.290 --> 26:38.527
did

26:20.290 --> 26:38.527
that, what

26:20.290 --> 26:38.527
led to that? We were

26:38.547 --> 26:47.935
airlifted in, into an LZ, we got off the choppers. 
We hadn't gone far, maybe 100 yards. We were in the

26:54.821 --> 27:07.535
middle of a rice paddy in the woodland, maybe 
another 100 yards south. We were strung out, I

27:07.555 --> 27:15.864
guess, as far as the point, being almost within 40 
yards of the woodland and as far back as a couple

27:07.555 --> 27:15.864
hundred yards. Sniper's in the woodland over 
there. and

27:17.193 --> 27:35.575
probably roughly 12, if it wasn't 6 or 12 times.

27:39.079 --> 27:39.900
And it turned into an all day fire fight. And it kept 
us pinned down. We couldn't move. We couldn't see

27:42.263 --> 27:42.683
them. The baby boots stuck out like sore thumbs. 
The grass got that high. And there was an old hooch

27:44.065 --> 27:46.508
right out in the middle, and that turned into the 
command post. And,

27:47.365 --> 28:04.907
of

27:47.365 --> 28:04.907
course,

27:47.365 --> 28:04.907
there were some padded-backs that almost 
everybody worked on. Padded-backs,

28:04.927 --> 28:07.110
padded-backs, padded-backs. And, at the point, 
the machine gun and his ammo barrel were both shot

28:07.130 --> 28:09.733
through the head. They weren't dead. The radio man 
made some movement for free, and that radio was

28:10.134 --> 28:11.736
back there. I

28:12.728 --> 28:29.172
got to

28:12.728 --> 28:29.172
the command post and I said they need a medic to pull 
in. I looked up there and it was kind of hard. It was

28:30.053 --> 28:32.336
hot and there was a lot of bullets coming. It was one 
of those things where you could just say I can't do

28:32.356 --> 28:33.678
it. That day I found out that I just wasn't made of 
it. I was more scared after the go with than going

28:36.708 --> 28:50.784
up there. And that's where I caught a ricochet. And 
got up there. It was a big soldier's off to the high

28:55.990 --> 28:58.733
left and they just pointed to the two guys over 
there. And in the meantime, we had Air Force. They

29:05.362 --> 29:11.653
were bombing the woodlands while they were gone. 
The snipers had nearly come back out of the bunkers

29:11.673 --> 29:13.295
while they were gone. I got a word to them they were 
both pretty bad. Trying

29:18.507 --> 29:32.975
to

29:18.507 --> 29:32.975
patch them. You just had to get up and kind of do it. 
You just had to throw some fire at them, put them

29:35.019 --> 29:38.787
back in the bunker, and then put a patch on them, ace 
band advantage. So I needed to stay with it. And

29:41.170 --> 30:01.373
because I wasn't the only medic in the outfield out 
there, just to handle whatever else. But at that

30:01.393 --> 30:03.035
time, those two guys needed a medic there at that 
time. So we were right there in front of them. You

30:03.876 --> 30:04.617
know, we were right up with them. I stayed with 
them. And we changed gunfire, made it three hours,

30:05.037 --> 30:06.739
and took care of them anyway after that. Jets

30:07.850 --> 30:25.894
finally, I guess

30:07.850 --> 30:25.894
they hit the bunkers close enough to where it 
pushed them on back down.

30:30.260 --> 30:32.403
They disappeared somewhere. And the choppers 
came in, took the guys on the choppers, lost one of

30:32.423 --> 30:34.846
them. I don't know. I don't know. Later on. And then 
we stayed there in the field that night. do

30:37.988 --> 30:56.571
you think the volume was affected as they used to 
make all those things yeah do you think there were

30:37.988 --> 30:56.571
actual targets or you know the methods were 
reported are they just so in line involved well uh

30:37.988 --> 30:56.571
the uh the 111 the airport the passport we called in 
down in the delta yeah they were They

30:57.310 --> 31:07.465
were accurate

30:57.310 --> 31:07.465
enough. I mean, if we had something dropped to him, 
we'd come back so close that we'd want to catch some

31:09.508 --> 31:13.955
of the stuff. And we had soldiers, our own men, 
shrapnel ripped through one of them. I didn't lose

31:18.562 --> 31:19.062
anything. Arm or leg or part of the face or 
something like that. Shrapnel or a bomb. Maybe

31:21.166 --> 31:24.430
they won't see what a bomb looked like when it went 
off. But it was close enough. Late time, and I

31:25.152 --> 31:26.153
didn't like that stuff. Real

31:27.213 --> 31:52.096
close in there. Real close. Got a bad smell to it, 
too. It burns the flesh. It burns the flesh. Tell

31:53.717 --> 31:54.298
when it's doing its job. The smell. I guess that's 
what I remember the most. They call it the smell.

31:57.115 --> 32:15.568
But

31:57.115 --> 32:15.568
as far as the B-52 rays, the big bombs, I don't think 
they were just bombing. I'm sure a lot of bombs

32:15.588 --> 32:16.930
didn't get to targets involved in that too. But

32:17.720 --> 32:33.736
as far as the fighter jets, you know, they were 
looking pretty good, I think. That's just one

32:33.756 --> 32:34.177
spot. Whatever it was, they were an airstrike for 
us, but it didn't go out that way. And they got us out

32:35.781 --> 32:36.302
alive. We

32:36.788 --> 32:57.456
couldn't move them, they couldn't move us. They 
had us, and they took them out for us to put some

32:57.476 --> 32:58.978
heavy stuff on them. Our artillery got a lot, but it 
just didn't seem like it had good effect at the

32:58.998 --> 33:00.700
time. How did you feel when you got right here? Were 
you tired? Oh, I don't know. He

33:04.278 --> 33:28.806
sure wasn't a hero, but when he got to California, a 
lot of them, like the one I talked to, he was on

33:04.278 --> 33:28.806
there. You know, they harassed him. I wouldn't say 
harassed him. You know, they were at the airport.

33:30.708 --> 33:31.088
All kinds of stuff. I didn't pay much attention to 
him. But I processed out in Oakland, California,

33:31.829 --> 33:33.251
on the flight from Oakland. But Dallas loved Phil. 
In

33:33.978 --> 33:54.622
fact, a guy went and placed a plane with a 
technician who got out of the fourth division at

33:33.978 --> 33:54.622
the same time. He rode on the same plane from 
California. Uh, wouldn't stewardages, civilian

33:55.503 --> 33:57.285
people on the plane, they would hate him, no 
question.

34:01.720 --> 34:28.150
I

34:01.720 --> 34:28.150
just kind of laid around the house for the first 
week, and the first thing I did when Did

34:30.982 --> 34:54.736
your friends and people that knew you then over 
there, did they kind of avoid you? No, my friends

34:54.756 --> 34:55.196
didn't. They were more curious and pleased with my 
question. And talked about it. It's something I

34:56.699 --> 34:57.700
never just refused to talk about. I think I told my 
brother one time, like, talk about something

34:57.720 --> 34:59.082
else. I

34:59.467 --> 35:14.691
kind

34:59.467 --> 35:14.691
of got burned out on them. But it seems like 
everybody that's asked me questions, everybody

35:14.711 --> 35:20.199
wants to talk about me sincerely.

35:23.384 --> 35:25.427
They made me think they wanted to know something, 
so I was always willing to talk to them about it. But

35:25.447 --> 35:26.689
I don't know what my life would have been like If

35:27.040 --> 35:47.476
I hadn't have done it, I would. The things I did and 
didn't do after I got back was pretty wild when I got

35:47.496 --> 35:49.099
back. I just was, you know, kind of a rebel type of 
thing. Nobody would tell me what to do. I know that

35:50.842 --> 35:51.563
A&M will have more time. history

35:51.796 --> 35:59.155
class. History is one of the biggest . But

36:00.284 --> 36:22.199
at the time, I just, you know, I'm sitting here 
thinking, you know, well, I've already, I've been

36:00.284 --> 36:22.199
on the other side of the world. I've been through 
all this. I don't have to sit here and listen to this

36:22.780 --> 36:24.162
and shake your head here. I've been out of the 
classroom, and this is 23 years. It helped me. And I

36:25.544 --> 36:26.526
was like, well, I just got in more trouble. I know 
that didn't help me in anything. That was just the

36:27.347 --> 36:27.928
way I felt. And any time you ran into a veteran 
that's been over there, you made friends with

36:29.680 --> 36:44.820
them. That's who you're most associated with. So 
you're not into a little more coping? Like, a lot of

36:48.906 --> 36:51.930
people come back and, I mean, they're really 
scarred. I mean, they get all of a sudden, they're

36:51.950 --> 36:54.714
bitter. I mean, you're not bitter. Are you bitter? 
No. I was reading an author. I might have been in

36:57.477 --> 36:58.759
this last reader's project, but... Not everybody 
goes out to it. Like the Platoon movie? They went to

37:06.662 --> 37:10.467
go see a movie with Jane Fonda. Yeah. And they went 
outside in the lobby and they were just all crying.

37:15.914 --> 37:18.817
Yeah, I went to see Platoon. I didn't go out to the 
lobby. I don't know. I think I got a little drunk on

37:21.340 --> 37:25.085
two or three scenes. It didn't bother me. The only 
thing that I had to adjust to was sleeping

37:28.372 --> 37:45.474
when I

37:28.372 --> 37:45.474
got back. It was hard to know that you could, and it 
only lasted for like a week or two. I was afraid to go

37:47.076 --> 37:48.398
to sleep. I was afraid I wouldn't wake up, you know, 
but I couldn't convince myself I was safe in the

37:48.418 --> 37:52.764
climate of my room. Because over there, that's one 
thing you did go to sleep on. So yeah, I didn't sleep

37:54.005 --> 37:54.586
then. I don't know. It's

37:55.642 --> 38:06.823
not a twig, it wasn't a rifle. Thunder came over the 
other hand. And that and a sudden, but anymore, a

38:08.746 --> 38:16.200
sudden rifle or pistol shot just about hit me on the 
ground. But it took about over a year to get it back.

38:17.763 --> 38:18.384
I got back in November. Pistols coming on, 
firetruckers. You

38:19.773 --> 38:35.056
know,

38:19.773 --> 38:35.056
sometimes I thought I was going to have a heart 
attack just driving down the street. And still to

38:35.076 --> 38:39.503
this day, a gunshot that goes off without me 
knowing what it's fixing to do, I really get up. It

38:39.938 --> 39:06.823
had a pretty good impact, I guess on my life. Ever

39:08.373 --> 39:26.196
since I was a little kid, I wanted a plate army a lot. 
Say it's fulfilling a kid's dream to go to war, but

39:26.216 --> 39:31.703
it was an experience that I wouldn't take for... I 
wouldn't really want to go to war, but I wouldn't

39:31.723 --> 39:34.647
trade it for anything. How did you feel about the 
anti-war protesters? Those people, I don't

39:35.668 --> 39:37.671
really have a whole lot of interest in them. uh

39:38.377 --> 40:07.033
uh the

39:38.377 --> 40:07.033
people

39:38.377 --> 40:07.033
that

40:09.224 --> 40:31.417
were

40:09.224 --> 40:31.417
in school that, uh, you're smart enough to stay in 
school, they, uh, I, I remember correctly, you

40:09.224 --> 40:31.417
know, they just didn't pull you out of school. If 
you chose to go to school, you could walk out of

40:31.437 --> 40:32.619
school. Uh, married and so many kids, I think, and I 
don't exactly know how much. Uh, but the ones that,

40:34.802 --> 40:36.565
uh, deliberately, gods left the craft where they 
deliberately I

40:38.013 --> 40:47.571
tried to stay out of the distance before they took 
me out the other day. I didn't have much use for

40:47.591 --> 40:48.234
them. I mean, back to the station. What

40:49.792 --> 41:12.831
about vets that have come back from Vietnam and now 
they're against it? We had some people come and

41:12.851 --> 41:13.632
talk to us. They were from veterans for peace and 
veterans against the war. And they think the world

41:14.933 --> 41:15.854
is totally wrong now. And they speak out against 
it. And if they've been over there and they came

41:16.494 --> 41:18.356
back, do you think they're not bitter toward it? 
No. I couldn't be. I'd say if there's any

41:18.756 --> 41:19.697
bitterness, it's at war. I'm

41:20.217 --> 41:41.114
not even sure if

41:20.217 --> 41:41.114
Lyndon Johnson had control over it, but somebody 
did, but more than one person did. Whoever those

41:41.135 --> 41:44.200
people were, I have no bitterness for the harm of 
the military. Even

41:45.698 --> 42:07.301
though we didn't accomplish what the G.I. wanted 
us to accomplish, we had to do some good at the time.

42:08.542 --> 42:10.484
The Vietnamese that are in America today, if we 
hadn't have done it, they wouldn't be here today. A

42:10.504 --> 42:11.065
lot of lives were changed.

42:14.470 --> 42:38.465
I

42:14.470 --> 42:38.465
mean, I'm kind of, I don't know how I feel about, you 
know, the business coming over here now. They're

42:38.485 --> 42:40.327
taking jobs, you know, but their lives are so much 
better now than they were before. They're,

42:40.347 --> 42:42.250
they're just like, they're, you know, they're 
just looking for a better way of living.

42:45.773 --> 43:10.725
Nobody

42:45.773 --> 43:10.725
that lives here in the United States really has any 
idea of what communism really is, except for what

42:45.773 --> 43:10.725
you read. You go into a country that is, it would be 
the last thing you would want in your country. So

43:12.547 --> 43:13.148
even though that, you know, They

43:13.330 --> 43:38.080
took it all over. I don't know just what I'm trying 
to say. I just wish there'd been less. I would like

43:39.562 --> 43:40.683
to see Vietnam today, a democratic society. It's a 
beautiful country, and the people are great. I

43:41.745 --> 43:42.966
hope someday I can go back to Vietnam and do this and 
this. Yeah.

44:06.740 --> 44:06.920
Oh, yeah. I don't know. It's just kind of like the 
air going out of the boom, I guess. It's not like,

44:08.482 --> 44:09.443
you know, it was all for nothing. No, it was for 
something. I don't really know what, but it was.

44:10.745 --> 44:11.565
But it was kind of sad to see it go down. You didn't 
have to do that.

44:23.868 --> 44:38.322
Let

44:23.868 --> 44:38.322
it go,

44:23.868 --> 44:38.322
I guess. The movies,

44:38.342 --> 44:49.272
there's been a lot of push for movies in Vietnam and 
all this stuff lately. Do you think most of that's

44:49.292 --> 44:50.853
an adequate portrayal of what happened over 
there? Somewhere they all have some authenticity

44:50.873 --> 44:51.834
to it. I've seen 14 in a full metal jacket. There's

44:53.517 --> 45:11.768
just, most of it's made from the entertainment. 
But you can, I don't know, some of it's got some

45:11.788 --> 45:13.872
brain to it, but the majority of it's not made from 
it.

45:18.627 --> 45:33.842
When

45:18.627 --> 45:33.842
we were measuring

45:18.627 --> 45:33.842
progress, do you think progress could be measured 
over there when you were fighting? Because they

45:33.862 --> 45:36.825
use body counts and various things like that. Do 
you think there was really an adequate way to

45:38.787 --> 45:41.630
measure progress over there? As far as the body 
count, how you were... I mean, we've had a lot of

45:42.491 --> 45:44.753
multiple fights and... Yeah, I think there was a 
lot of stretching and shooting there. The

45:46.977 --> 46:06.881
company commander can call in a body count. He may 
not have one, but he just may have an estimation of

46:06.901 --> 46:08.183
what. A lot of times you can see how many he did. Or 
they may just say, well, there's a freighter over

46:09.084 --> 46:11.947
here that had to be two or three, and that might have 
had them before he got stressed out. I don't know.

46:12.248 --> 46:12.428
It's a... There

46:12.880 --> 46:35.627
was a lot of, we have found, we have made enough of 
it, and it killed a lot of people. We've got

46:35.647 --> 46:37.409
members, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of 
thousands of people over there. As far as the

46:37.429 --> 46:38.991
actual number, there is a number that we've 
claimed they killed. Thank you. We have probably

46:39.231 --> 46:40.052
more than we have to do. I

46:41.703 --> 46:48.552
don't think so. Not where we

46:48.572 --> 46:57.585
were

46:48.572 --> 46:57.585
anyway. Maybe there was up

46:57.605 --> 47:03.914
north. I have no idea.
