WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:06.215
You had to use something that would get over the 
trees. That was one of the things that we did every

00:06.836 --> 00:09.860
once in a while. We didn't do it very long because 
somebody would figure it out and call the campus

00:10.781 --> 00:17.229
police. That first year, did you go to any 
out-of-town football games? We went to Baylor. I

00:22.355 --> 00:23.457
think Baylor was an out-of-town. How'd you get up 
there? I went with one of my ball players, took us up

00:24.738 --> 00:27.862
there. I had some friends at Baylor, so we looked 
them up. from El Paso. Did junior buddies ever

00:32.383 --> 00:35.129
hitchhike? Never did. My brother did. That's 
about the time when it phases down. Yeah, my

00:40.120 --> 00:42.305
brother hitchhiked a few times. He never had a car 
in college, and I finally got one when I was a

00:42.365 --> 00:45.512
junior. Right. So that first year you got around by 
foot. By foot. Or by friend. Or by friend. Did your

00:52.457 --> 00:53.558
roommate have a car? No. So we both, me and both 
parents figured out we didn't need cars as

00:55.059 --> 01:00.104
freshmen. Right. How often did you communicate 
with your parents and how? Every week. Every

01:04.428 --> 01:05.249
Sunday night. Call on my, you know, regular about 8 
o'clock. Make sure that, you know, my dad just

01:07.931 --> 01:11.074
said, all I want to hear is your voice. I want to make 
sure you're still breathing and, you know. And as

01:13.977 --> 01:18.722
you think back, how accurate were your 
descriptions of how things were going? Oh, I made

01:18.923 --> 01:20.184
it pitiful. I, you know, there, you know, I, of 
course, I poo-pooed it, made them, and the same

01:20.705 --> 01:27.152
with my letters and everything else. I mean, I'm, 
to this day, my wife to this day doesn't believe I

01:27.232 --> 01:32.939
graduated from Texas A&M. She says, you can't 
write. I know you can't read. So how did you get out

01:36.503 --> 01:38.185
of the school? I said, well, I worked, you know, I 
did the work that was required. Now you already had

01:42.125 --> 01:46.376
this special young lady back home. Yes. How did you 
communicate with her? I wrote her letters and then

01:49.082 --> 01:52.391
I called her every week. We could only talk for like 
three minutes. Did she write you letters? Oh,

01:56.300 --> 01:56.481
yeah. I got one or two a week. Remember your box 
number? Oh, no, I had a different one every single

02:01.210 --> 02:04.475
year. And your box was at MSC or at Northgate? 
Northgate. At Northgate. Yeah, every year it was

02:10.865 --> 02:12.647
Northgate. And did you get much other mail except 
from her? No. I mean, that's what I'd go for, is just

02:17.395 --> 02:20.940
to get letters from her. My parents would ride. My 
mom would ride. Now, was she in school back home?

02:25.580 --> 02:26.382
She was at UTEP. At UTEP, okay. She was a year behind 
me, but she went to UTEP. Did you have any dates?

02:34.095 --> 02:37.762
Well, fortunately, my brother made a lot of 
friends in College Station. One of them was Joe

02:38.503 --> 02:39.705
Desa. I don't even remember, Joe Joe was a referee. 
D-A-I-S-A.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.924
And his wife was Wanda, and she was always in the 
plays. But they had a daughter and a son. And the

02:51.828 --> 02:55.095
daughter was a couple years behind me. Of course, 
Louie, my brother, was always trying tell her hey

02:58.467 --> 03:05.777
now my brother's coming, my brother's coming, you 
need to get hooked up with him, all this kind of

02:58.467 --> 03:05.777
stuff. And actually I wanted to play football at 
A&M and Gene Stallings looked at my tapes and I

03:05.997 --> 03:14.329
broke my neck when I was a senior. So that went out 
the window but I was basically brought into

03:14.669 --> 03:26.365
College Station knowing the Daces and Bill 
Broach, I don't know, Bill Broach who owned the

03:14.669 --> 03:26.365
Shells? There was a real good friend of mine. And so 
my junior, my sophomore year, I never ate one meal

03:28.791 --> 03:38.142
at Sebesa Hall at night. I'd walk over to the 
Deysa's. They had a place for me every night. Where

03:42.607 --> 03:44.469
did they live? You remember where Tom lived? Right 
behind the

03:46.271 --> 03:53.680
Presbyterian Church, that little subdivision 
over there. At Northgate? Northgate. Right

03:55.462 --> 03:56.183
around in there. They had a high house and I could 
walk over there and eat dinner and talk with Joe

03:56.753 --> 04:00.537
about it. Because he was a basketball referee for 
the Southwest Conference. And he stayed with my

04:05.082 --> 04:07.465
parents when he'd referee out there. So he wanted 
me to be there every day to talk about sports.

04:13.111 --> 04:16.655
Because his son was not interested in sports and 
his daughter wasn't interested in sports. So we'd

04:16.675 --> 04:17.997
go over there. And of course I got his daughter a 
date with Dave Elmendorf. And they dated for two

04:22.722 --> 04:24.364
years. So it was kind of a fun deal. Having them 
there in town was like having family and they took

04:28.961 --> 04:34.989
care of me real well.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.453
When did you go home for the first time that first 
fall? I got to go home at Thanksgiving and at

04:39.614 --> 04:43.099
Christmas. How did you get back and forth? 
Airplane.

04:47.750 --> 04:53.738
And what were, when you got home Thanksgiving, 
what did you tell your parents it was like? How were

04:53.798 --> 04:54.659
things going? Well, it was kind of unique. My 
first, at Thanksgiving, I met up with a girl from

04:56.602 --> 05:03.451
Baylor who was one of my, you know, good, good 
friends in high school. And she was cute as can be.

05:04.593 --> 05:13.605
And I have a, I get off the airplane and my 
girlfriend's at the bottom of the, you know, you

05:04.593 --> 05:13.605
didn't have a, walkway, you got off stairs. You 
walk down this stairs and she's sitting down there

05:15.457 --> 05:29.772
at the bottom and I've got my arm around this girl 
with a cowboy hat on and my coat bag hanging over my

05:15.457 --> 05:29.772
shoulder and I'm walking off and she sees me and 
she's, you know, That's how I got off the airplane

05:30.089 --> 05:31.871
the first time. And I'm here explaining to her, 
this is so-and-so. She's from Baylor. I was just

05:35.096 --> 05:36.638
helping her out down the stairs. So she proceeds to 
tell my mom that when I got off the airplane, I had my

05:38.240 --> 05:45.009
arm around this blonde, and I had a cowboy. She'd 
never seen me in a cowboy hat. I bought a cowboy hat

05:46.652 --> 05:48.975
down there. So my dad thought it was the fun. He 
thought that was the greatest thing in the world

05:51.979 --> 05:57.987
for me to get off the plane with a cowboy hat and an 
arm around this blonde. We had a good time, and of

05:58.928 --> 06:05.138
course my dad saw me, and he says, holy cow, what 
have you been eating? I gained about 20 pounds, and

06:05.239 --> 06:08.985
I think most of that was attributed to the beer. And 
he says, is that what I'm paying for? I told him, I

06:14.394 --> 06:16.938
said, you don't realize how much this costs. This 
education has cost him. That's the way the whole

06:20.825 --> 06:24.531
trip went. the gaining weight and arms around 
girls and obviously you know you're doing okay you

06:25.490 --> 06:50.046
don't seem like you're you're you're struggling 
much you're certain uh all right and uh what what

06:25.490 --> 06:50.046
did you when they ask you what's it like how are 
things going what did you tell them i loved it i told

06:25.490 --> 06:50.046
them you know i said i'm never going to come back to 
el paso he says i'm going to live and in East Texas,

06:50.448 --> 06:52.850
and I told my girlfriend that. I said, you know, 
we're going to live in East Texas. I do not ever want

06:55.954 --> 06:57.835
to come back to El Paso. I love the humidity. I love 
the rain. I love everything about, you know, and

07:00.859 --> 07:04.282
most people hate it. I mean, you tell them, and I 
loved it. I acclimated to the humidity in a minute.

07:09.747 --> 07:10.648
You know, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the green trees 
and all the stuff down there. So being from the

07:15.453 --> 07:17.215
desert southwest, They just couldn't understand 
it. My parents, my dad especially, he, you know,

07:20.548 --> 07:27.439
because he came from Pennsylvania, he swore he'd 
never go through another wet winter, so. What did

07:27.840 --> 07:31.065
you tell him about being an Aggie? Of course, my dad 
says, well, how are you doing? There's no women

07:33.529 --> 07:35.432
down there. And my grandfather was very upset that 
I wasn't in the Corps. Very, very upset. He forced

07:41.801 --> 07:44.145
my brother to be in the Corps for three years. Of 
course, my brother hated it. And he literally

07:46.726 --> 07:52.672
would not talk to me about it, not because I wasn't 
in the Corps. He says, you're missing everything.

07:54.494 --> 07:57.217
And I said, my life is full. I can't do anymore. I 
said, I'm really pretty full. But they wanted to

08:01.681 --> 08:06.746
know how architecture was going. Because of 
course, my dad was, I want you to draw these set of

08:06.766 --> 08:12.412
plans for a new building we're going to build. And 
they're all looking for. They want that degree and

08:15.582 --> 08:19.808
that knowledge, and they want to start using it. 
And so we did a project for him when I was third year

08:19.828 --> 08:29.583
with Larry, and we drew up a building for him and 
everything. Then when you go home, Chris, let's

08:29.603 --> 08:33.148
say, no, the semester's not over in those days. 
Finals. How did that first semester go

08:35.592 --> 08:37.675
academically? Well, see, we were on a three-point 
system when I first started. So it was a struggle. I

08:44.620 --> 08:47.824
got through the first semester was really I got 
through everything. I passed everything pretty

08:47.844 --> 08:50.268
well, C's and B's. I think I got a C in history and I 
think I got a C in English. No, I failed English my

08:54.814 --> 08:58.399
freshman year, first semester. Took it again in 
the spring and passed it. But that first semester,

09:01.524 --> 09:04.869
I could not do the English. I mean, it was a lot of 
reading and I'm not a reader. All right, in

09:07.760 --> 09:12.745
hindsight, had Austin not done a good job in 
preparing you? Not at all. Is that right? Not at

09:14.347 --> 09:14.647
all. They did real well in the math, but because I 
think I didn't have parents that, as long as I was

09:14.687 --> 09:33.186
making B's and C's in high school, for me they 
thought, hey, for Sam, my brothers were all honor

09:14.687 --> 09:33.186
students, both above me and behind me. I was the one 
in the middle that, you know, If he can just get out

09:35.857 --> 09:38.680
and get by, we're going to let him slide. So that's 
really how I got by with just about all of my

09:39.941 --> 09:45.768
education is just enough to get by. All right. So at 
the end of the first semester there was no break

09:46.769 --> 09:50.913
then. Right. You stay there. And was Buddy Denton 
yet, was he still advising or had he already gone?

09:58.221 --> 09:58.301
Yes. No, I did meet him. His name is really 
familiar. I have coffee with him twice a month. A

10:06.270 --> 10:07.691
group of old guys. Barney Welch, one of the former 
football coaches, and oh,

10:07.711 --> 10:16.241
the head of the P.E. department then. Austin, no, 
Austin Curley, he's another one that joins us. Oh,

10:23.369 --> 10:28.695
boy, my brain forgetting, too.

10:30.970 --> 10:35.157
When you and your buddies went to class, how did you 
all dress? Just Levi's and a shirt. That was our

10:38.162 --> 10:39.043
daily. And what did you take? What kind of stuff did 
you take to class? I always had a briefcase because

10:44.813 --> 10:50.442
I always had triangles and drawing stuff and 
compasses and everything. So, you know, I thought

10:50.502 --> 10:52.405
I was a real nerd here. Everybody else is just 
grabbing their books and walking to class, and

10:52.886 --> 10:56.792
I've got a briefcase, and I've got Of course, I got 
three classes worth of stuff in there, so it was.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.002
And so you're taking 18, 19 hours? Yeah, I was 
taking 18 hours pretty much every semester. One of

11:07.306 --> 11:12.373
the things that will probably dumbfound you, 
today the average student thinks 12 is full-time.

11:12.413 --> 11:14.696
Well, our son was just graduated there. Oh, okay. 
All right. And he was in the Corps. He, you know, to

11:16.979 --> 11:24.869
digress, he fortunately got the full benefit of 
A&M. He would consider me to be a two percenter. And

11:28.278 --> 11:34.686
I'll have to say I was because, you know, all I did 
was go to architecture and go to work. That was my

11:34.926 --> 11:37.429
life after baseball. There was no other, you know. 
That spring, as varsity, as baseball goes, was

11:41.795 --> 11:46.521
there a freshman team then? There was a freshman 
team. I played on the freshman team. And what

11:48.463 --> 11:49.505
position did you play? I was a pitcher. Right. And 
who were some of the other key freshmen that year?

11:54.150 --> 11:57.795
Well, John Woods, Denny Beal, Charlie Jenkins. 
R.J.

11:58.130 --> 12:03.238
Englert was a freshman with me. R.J. went to the, he 
played on the A team or the varsity. He played

12:10.870 --> 12:11.812
there. About how many of those freshman baseball 
players thought they were going to play pro ball?

12:20.305 --> 12:20.966
Not too many. R.J. did. Charlie did. I think that 
was about it. Everybody else was just there to

12:25.333 --> 12:28.237
play, you know, get through school. And of the 
freshman baseball players that year, about how

12:28.257 --> 12:33.483
many of them were on scholarship? I think it was 
four. Four out of 15? Maybe we had 15 on the team.

12:39.310 --> 12:42.634
Now, did you describe, identify yourself as a 
walk-on? Did you all use that term? Oh, yeah. You

12:44.196 --> 12:45.157
used that term? That's what we did. To me it was 
different because I was known as Lou's little

12:48.333 --> 12:51.957
brother. Sure. So, you know, and everybody says, 
well, you're not as good as your brother. I said,

12:55.620 --> 12:57.462
well, there aren't too many that are. So you've got 
to understand, you know, I said he was all

12:58.263 --> 13:02.407
Southwest Conference when he was a freshman. He 
was a sophomore of the year as a sophomore.

13:05.651 --> 13:06.952
All-American as a junior. Very few ballplayers as 
good as my brother. So I was always known as Lou's

13:09.675 --> 13:11.997
little brother. You know, I really was not that 
good. I shouldn't have, you know, I pitched a few

13:14.720 --> 13:17.783
innings and that's about it. I was entertainment 
for Tom Chandler. He'd put me at third base,

13:22.129 --> 13:27.294
because my brother used to play third base and he'd 
talk Spanish the whole practice. And Tom would, it

13:28.355 --> 13:37.663
was hilarious because Louie would do a whole game 
in Spanish, a commentary in Spanish of what

13:28.355 --> 13:37.663
Chandler was doing and everything else. I mean him 
and Tom were very, very good friends. So here he

13:41.147 --> 13:44.850
puts me at third base and wants me to take infield. 
And I can't catch nothing. I'm telling you, I won't

13:48.411 --> 13:50.153
catch anything. I wasn't going to get hit in the 
face with the baseball. And he says, I don't care if

13:52.196 --> 13:54.820
you catch anything, just talk Spanish. Tell us 
what's going on in Spanish. I'd commentate the

13:56.422 --> 13:58.585
game in Spanish. And every time I'd walk on the 
baseball field, all the guys that had played

13:59.566 --> 14:06.055
baseball would move out to this. I'd walk on the 
field and he'd say, holy cow, when's the balloon

14:06.175 --> 14:10.821
going up? Because I was gaining weight. And by my 
sophomore year, he says, if you're going to pitch,

14:13.070 --> 14:21.107
you need to get about 20 pounds off. I said, I'll get 
it off, coach. I'll get it off. And I worked

14:22.931 --> 14:23.973
diligently. I got the weight off. And I showed up in 
spring. And he says, I thought you were going to get

14:25.917 --> 14:28.603
20 pounds off. He says, we need to work on this. 
Every night, he'd be running me. to get the weight

14:32.570 --> 14:35.393
off. With spring baseball, describe the 
workouts. I've watched college baseball now. If

14:45.125 --> 14:51.553
the starters had 10 swings at the bat, that was a 
lot. If they took 15 balls at infield, that was a

14:51.733 --> 14:54.577
lot. Of course, our field was not Taj Mahal back 
there. Tom had one assistant and it was it was a

15:02.725 --> 15:25.864
basically a very simple we didn't get much we 
didn't get much workout and with Tom not being able

15:02.725 --> 15:25.864
you know having a lot of help we didn't get much 
coaching I mean the key guys got the coaching I mean

15:02.725 --> 15:25.864
he'd concentrate on three or four guys five guys 
and work with them but I pitched a lot of batting

15:02.725 --> 15:25.864
practice And I did a lot of running. Now the varsity 
had about 15, 18? 18 people on it. Okay. And then you

15:33.621 --> 15:35.122
freshmen. Workouts began about what time? We'd 
get there about 2, we'd want to start about 3. And it

15:41.009 --> 15:42.010
would go on how long? Until 6 o'clock. Did you all do 
any physical workouts? We, yeah, we very limited

15:46.915 --> 15:50.079
weight lifting. Back then weight lifting was not 
you know, encouraged by baseball players. For

15:53.816 --> 15:58.081
baseball players, they thought it'd make us, you 
know, hurt our muscles and we needed to be loose. So

15:58.922 --> 16:04.249
we went to the workout room, but I mean, we never 
were allowed to weigh or lift more than so many

15:58.922 --> 16:04.249
pounds and that kind of stuff. And where was that 
room? It was right behind

16:05.731 --> 16:10.957
G. Raleigh. Not G. Raleigh. It was in the swimming 
complex. Oh, oh, oh. Down. It was a dungeon. Down's

16:15.683 --> 16:18.126
not a, the Down's an auditorium? Or the old 
basketball arena. Well, it was where the indoor

16:25.045 --> 16:26.767
swimming pool was. Okay, all right. It was right 
behind there. And it was not, I don't know how

16:29.590 --> 16:33.414
anybody worked down there, but that's what we did. 
Now, what equipment did the institution provide?

16:39.141 --> 16:40.722
Did you have your own gloves? We brought our own 
gloves and cleats. They gave us a hat. We got to keep

16:44.266 --> 16:45.408
our hats. Everything else was uniform that we 
turned back. So you got a uniform, they wash it for

16:47.857 --> 16:52.242
you, and they give it back at the end of the year. Did 
you get assigned a number as a freshman? Yeah, I got

16:55.265 --> 16:58.429
signed, I think it was 27. It had no significance. 
No significance. Well, I got what was on it and what

17:02.514 --> 17:04.376
was there. Did the freshman team play games? Yeah. 
We played about, I guess about 11, 12 games. We

17:12.305 --> 17:13.886
actually traveled once. With whom? We played SMU, 
TCU, people in Southwest Conference. We played

17:18.051 --> 17:20.695
Glenn and a couple other junior colleges. And 
out-of-town games, where did you travel to? We

17:25.541 --> 17:27.263
went to Austin one time. Did you? Well, that was our 
out-of-town game that year. And did you all win it?

17:31.869 --> 17:32.310
No, we didn't. Oh, boy. We didn't win too many 
against Texas when we played. All right. You

17:38.779 --> 17:42.864
worked out five days a week or six as a freshman? 
Five. Five. Actually four. Chandler figured

17:45.965 --> 17:48.509
Friday was like everybody else. Everybody was 
going to go home. So Friday we weren't really

17:49.450 --> 17:52.374
required to be there. And you went to, you freshmen 
went to the varsity games but did not suit up.

17:57.882 --> 17:58.483
Correct. Did you all have any duties? Oh yeah. We 
raked the field. We lined the field. Whatever it

18:03.991 --> 18:06.394
took to get the field ready, that's what we did. Did 
you all ever do any pranks, good bull? I didn't.

18:14.307 --> 18:15.048
class did. I mean I got out of there before I was in 
varsity where all the pranksters were so I really

18:15.068 --> 18:21.277
didn't get to do much. And you freshmen didn't do 
anything with the, you didn't play any, attempt

18:21.377 --> 18:27.607
any tricks on the varsity? No, we were too scared of 
the varsity. Those guys were all, you know. Then

18:33.856 --> 18:35.338
spring break did you go home? Of course that was 
just an Easter break then. Yeah, but we didn't go

18:37.802 --> 18:40.245
home because we were playing baseball. So we had to 
stay there. About how many people attended the

18:42.286 --> 18:45.852
baseball games then? Eh, if we had 50, it was a lot. 
We thought we had a good crowd. And the stadium, the

18:49.538 --> 18:54.206
baseball stadium was due south of the, of Kyle 
Field? It was, yeah, southwest. It was on that

18:56.770 --> 18:57.591
corner. The center field was on the corner of G 
Rowley. Yeah, that's what I thought. I mean of

19:00.596 --> 19:02.039
Kyle. Kyle, yeah, yeah. Let's see. You get your 
grades in the spring semester and how was that

19:08.247 --> 19:13.813
semester? About the same. I have to take English 
again. I have to take the second semester English

19:15.695 --> 19:20.981
in summer school, which I took at UTEP. Okay. And 
you go back home and work for your dad. All summer

19:24.364 --> 19:26.006
and then get ready to go. I can't wait to get back to 
school. And you're driving the truck and all that.

19:29.470 --> 19:29.570
Yeah. Did you ever think about transferring? No. 
Did you think about changing your major? No. I had,

19:37.600 --> 19:44.250
for some reason, I had the confidence, stupid as it 
was for not studying as much as I did, that I was just

19:37.600 --> 19:44.250
going to make it. I mean, I was going to do whatever 
it took and going to summer school and working and

19:44.310 --> 19:52.161
just communicating. I did a lot of talking to the 
profs. I mean, I spent a lot of time in their

19:54.204 --> 19:56.347
offices. Who were some of those? I wish I could 
remember. I had a woman English prof. and I can't

20:03.134 --> 20:10.851
remember her name, but she, you know, I'd miss a lot 
of classes with baseball, and I went in there and

20:03.134 --> 20:10.851
said, I'm a baseball player. You tell me what I can 
do to get a C in this class, and I'll do whatever you

20:11.873 --> 20:17.084
tell me to do. I said, and I'm also an architecture 
student, so all my mornings are filled with labs

20:21.781 --> 20:50.910
and I said so if it means coming in at night if it 
means doing whatever and she says no no but you know

20:21.781 --> 20:50.910
you're a horrible writer you can't write a 
sentence to save your life I said well I you know I'm

20:21.781 --> 20:50.910
very simple I'm a simple person I just simple 
sentences yes you are so she helped and she you know

20:21.781 --> 20:50.910
she gave me gave me a lot of credit on stuff that I did 
that you know that I could do so that's how I really

20:21.781 --> 20:50.910
got through my one of my English classes And with 
Larry Priesmeier. I mean, spending a lot of time in

20:54.188 --> 21:04.119
his, you know, other classes of his to just try and 
learn, you know, what I needed to do to get through

20:54.188 --> 21:04.119
the architecture. I never struggled with 
architecture. I struggled with everything else.

21:07.102 --> 21:09.165
Allen Stasel, Rodney Hill. Rodney Hill. See, 
Rodney Hill was, you know, he was landscape. And he

21:12.048 --> 21:16.412
was one of the guys that said he thought I would do 
better in landscape. I said, are you kidding? I

21:17.754 --> 21:18.254
don't want to. And believe it or not, I was. I had a 
landscape company for two years, putting in all

21:20.000 --> 21:25.488
those stupid plants that he was telling me the 
name. So, you know, it comes back to bite you. You

21:28.353 --> 21:33.581
know, the stories go, learn all you can because you 
may need it someday. John Greer? John Greer was

21:34.642 --> 21:35.604
there. I still can't remember the guy that was from 
Santa Fe, Pecos, New Mexico.

21:46.932 --> 21:52.721
Were there any, do you remember any famous people 
that came to lecture, to visit? I don't. We had,

21:56.406 --> 21:58.789
I.M. Pei came to, he did a judging of some stuff that 
the upperclassmen did once, and then Phillip

21:58.809 --> 22:06.541
Johnson came. Franklin Wright was still alive, I 
believe, but we saw a lot of his stuff. How much did

22:14.557 --> 22:21.851
you and during those four years, how much did you 
and your buddies see of Romanek? How visible was

22:21.871 --> 22:22.712
he? A lot. He was in every class. I think he came by 
the class at least once or twice a week. Make

22:27.922 --> 22:32.451
believe I didn't know him and as a close friend, 
describe Romanek. Make believe I'd never seen him

22:32.491 --> 22:34.454
or heard him. I'd describe him as a foreigner. 
Because he was foreign to everything at that

22:37.338 --> 22:42.306
school except the architecture department. I 
mean, he really was. He drove a big black Buick

22:43.388 --> 22:45.791
Riviera. And he'd park it right where nobody could 
get in and nobody could get out. And he'd walk in.

22:51.521 --> 22:52.582
And he'd walk in your class. And he'd tell you, what 
are you doing? I mean, to everybody. I don't

22:57.190 --> 22:58.051
understand. I don't understand. What is this? And 
he'd make you go through your diatribe on all this

23:04.557 --> 23:29.940
know you try and make up some big thing about you 
doing he says it just looks like a pile of crap to me

23:04.557 --> 23:29.940
you know and and he'd walk out he wouldn't give you 
an explanation he wouldn't give you his theory and

23:04.557 --> 23:29.940
but he was very very knowledgeable and he was i 
think his his knowledge of the profession and

23:04.557 --> 23:29.940
where it was going and what it needed to what needed 
to happen in it was uh very far reaching. What was

23:32.679 --> 23:39.007
his purpose, you think, in those, in that routine, 
those questions? I think he wanted to get us to

23:39.027 --> 23:43.632
think about actually what we were doing instead of 
just doing it. I think he had been around long

23:43.672 --> 23:58.729
enough that he could take, you know, he could tell 
the BS and the people who were really thinking

23:43.672 --> 23:58.729
about their work and he could see, you know, he, I 
mean, we had some really brilliant kids, I mean,

23:43.672 --> 23:58.729
guys that I worked with in the architecture 
department, I mean, several of them got fellows

23:59.131 --> 24:26.185
and they they went on i mean they were really pretty 
sharp guys and i i was just in awe of the things they

23:59.131 --> 24:26.185
could design and you know i didn't when you hear him 
come in and talk to these guys you think why can't i

23:59.131 --> 24:26.185
think like that you know why can't i do that you know 
you start you you just start seeing these are the

23:59.131 --> 24:26.185
architects that are going to be you know working 
for gerald heinz and working for the the people out

23:59.131 --> 24:26.185
there that are doing the things so it was you know it 
was uh I always thought, what the heck is he doing in

24:27.194 --> 24:28.976
here? I'm trying to do my work, and he's in here. And 
of course, Larry Priesmeier encouraged it. He'd

24:33.741 --> 24:34.602
want him in there. So all of them did. He would walk 
around, and I think he inspired a lot of people. He

24:42.329 --> 24:47.495
certainly didn't inspire me, but he did inspire a 
lot of the people who were really true good

24:42.329 --> 24:47.495
architects. All right, now he was the dean. He was 
the dean. Do you remember any of the other campus

24:49.657 --> 24:52.400
administrators? Did you have any impression of 
Earl Rudder? I thought, I thought Earl Runner did

24:55.696 --> 25:00.662
the greatest thing in the world. He allowed women 
on campus. I mean, that for us, that was, you know,

25:01.843 --> 25:05.668
you know, forget the Corps and all that stuff. That 
was great. You know, we weren't old army. We

25:08.351 --> 25:11.135
thought, hey, man, let's do more things like this. 
Let's. If there had been a poll when you were an

25:12.837 --> 25:22.108
undergraduate by the A&M student body regarding 
the admission of women, what do you think it would

25:12.837 --> 25:22.108
have been? Oh, 90% against and 10% for. That's what 
I think. I think because it was that the campus is

25:28.958 --> 25:37.011
still run by the Corps, and the Corps was not 
interested in having – I mean, talk about the

25:28.958 --> 25:37.011
students. If you just took it out of the non-regs, 
then it would have been the other way around. It

25:40.917 --> 25:42.039
would have been 90%. But, you know, there was 
13,000 guys there, and that's 6,000 of them were in

25:42.179 --> 25:46.746
the Corps, so – Describe the student body in 
general. Where were they from? What kinds of

25:51.634 --> 25:52.695
families? What kind of background? Income, 
geography, and so forth. I say they're all middle

25:58.743 --> 26:00.485
class. Very, very, very middle class. All country 
folk, as far as I was concerned. I mean, I went to

26:07.273 --> 26:08.895
Dallas with a few people. But they're all real. My

26:11.819 --> 26:18.687
brother came back and my dad says, oh, he's turned 
into a redneck. I said, no, he's not turned into a

26:18.767 --> 26:20.970
redneck. He's turned into a Texan. We're from El 
Paso. You've got to understand, El Paso mentality

26:23.373 --> 26:28.839
and Texan mentality are two different 
mentalities. And my brother came back and he was

26:28.859 --> 26:33.245
just really, y'all. It's just one of those things. 
My roommate was from Nacogdoches. bring two

26:41.975 --> 26:47.402
homemade cherry pies and his mom would show up and 
it was just like my mom. She, you know, John would,

26:47.422 --> 26:51.407
you know, you got to clean your room, John. You got 
to do this, John. You know, my mom would, you know,

26:52.588 --> 26:55.391
when they came, that's the same thing. And we had to 
clean up before they got there.

26:59.857 --> 27:01.699
But the student body, was it diverse? Were there 
some Hispanics? Yeah. I mean, one of the guys that

27:04.002 --> 27:06.565
plays in the band was from Mexico. And a couple 
other guys on the baseball team were Hispanics. So

27:10.507 --> 27:11.829
yeah, we had some Hispanics. Of course, the Hill 
brothers were there. On the football team, we had

27:14.833 --> 27:17.277
blacks. And the Hill brothers were hilarious. I 
mean, they'd come to baseball practice and go on

27:18.679 --> 27:22.225
the track. And they'd try and hit the baseball. 
They were rare characters. Those two Hill

27:27.934 --> 27:29.737
brothers were pretty good guys. As far as you know, 
how were Hispanics and blacks treated as A&M

27:30.037 --> 27:34.704
students? I was Hispanic. I mean, I let it be known, 
you know. I mean, I spoke Spanish. I did all that.

27:43.555 --> 27:48.101
I don't have the skin color, but still, I never saw 
anything. Everybody was treated the same. Your

27:50.985 --> 27:53.027
struggle was getting through the school. It 
wasn't against each other. That's right.

28:01.699 --> 28:03.641
You remember going to Silver Taps? Yes, Silver 
Taps, Silver Taps. I couldn't believe it. Why are

28:09.881 --> 28:10.862
they doing this? Did you and your buddies take it 
seriously? Yeah, we did. Everybody did, I think.

28:15.969 --> 28:17.051
No jokes, no pranks? No, it wasn't looked down on at 
all. I was one of these guys, why are they doing

28:19.354 --> 28:22.578
this? You kind of go, they're skeptical, and you go 
through it one time, and you think, oh, now I

28:22.839 --> 28:29.708
understand. During your four years, four and a 
half years, was there ever a silver taps involving

28:29.890 --> 28:36.466
someone you knew well? No. Really, you know, 
because I was two years on campus and two and a half

28:38.009 --> 28:43.883
off, I really can't remember anybody. Now it's 
held every month and there may be three or four

28:48.614 --> 28:55.524
because student body being so much larger. 
Religious activities, did you participate in any

28:56.646 --> 29:01.533
local religious group? I used to go to the All Faith 
Chapel. I went to church every Sunday. I made it a

29:06.661 --> 29:08.924
prayer to walk and get to church and stuff. I went to 
Catholic church. But yeah, I tried. You went over

29:13.346 --> 29:14.648
to St. Mary's? Yeah, I tried. And Sunday morning 
and Sunday night? Just Sunday morning. Sunday

29:19.457 --> 29:19.998
morning. Were there a good many students that 
went? Yeah, absolutely there were. I mean,

29:23.885 --> 29:27.471
everybody would be walking, so everybody would 
show up. And see, St. Mary's, it is doing well now.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.659
They've got a big building over there. It's really 
growing. Religious emphasis week wasn't

29:36.984 --> 29:41.049
anymore, was it? No. See, in my early years there in 
the early 60's, there was a week in the spring and

29:41.750 --> 29:50.822
the YMCA was not an important place. No, I never 
went to the Y. Never did. What about MSC? Oh yeah, I

29:54.788 --> 29:56.009
went to MSC a lot. What did you and your buddies do at 
the MSC? Oh, just, you know, bold, hung around. I

30:02.705 --> 30:04.668
spent most of my time at the Aggie Den. At the where? 
Aggie Den in Northgate. It was a pool hall. Oh,

30:10.056 --> 30:10.917
describe that. It's equivalent, I guess, to the 
Dixie Chicken now. They didn't serve alcohol. It

30:17.426 --> 30:21.392
was just a pool hall and a bunch of girly magazines 
that you'd go in there. And

30:21.452 --> 30:27.681
they probably was about half the size of the 
chicken. Once a weekend you'd go over there and

30:28.454 --> 30:34.341
shoot some pool and talk to everybody and have a 
good time and just leave. It didn't serve liquor. I

30:35.762 --> 30:44.232
mean we, I can't remember if we were the, when they 
changed the drinking age to 18 or not. It might have

30:44.973 --> 30:50.399
been because I remember we could start drinking 
and once we started drinking we generally. Before

30:51.460 --> 30:56.706
that change, where did you and your buddies get 
drinks? Did you all ever drive to Whiskey Bridge?

31:03.410 --> 31:03.650
No. I don't remember going down there. Really? Of 
course, for me it was kind of difficult. I'd just go

31:09.198 --> 31:12.963
to the Daces and have a beer or two if I wanted to. And 
I was never, you know, I never got drunk in college.

31:16.748 --> 31:22.255
In Fowler Hall, did anybody keep any beer or 
stronger alcohol?
