WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:07.443
OK, Paul Pye, F-Y-E, of Woods Hole Oceanographic. 
George Woolard, W-O-O-L-L-A-R-D,

00:08.324 --> 00:17.493
of Hawaii. And Maurice Ewing, E-W-I-N-G, head of 
the Lamont. Well, it's called Lamont Geological

00:25.561 --> 00:30.126
Observatory, but it is an oceanographic 
institution. Of course, he's dead. He left them a

00:31.874 --> 00:40.567
couple of years ago to come down to Galveston 
University in Texas and had their geophysical lab

00:31.874 --> 00:40.567
down there. But I'm thinking to myself, there were 
four that at one time were directing four out of the

00:40.587 --> 00:49.461
ten major labs. came out of that small group. They 
were all at Woods Hole. They were all at Woods Hole

00:53.091 --> 00:54.573
at the same time. We were all at Woods Hole at the 
same time. And then, of course, Columbus Island,

00:55.975 --> 01:00.821
but he was directed at that time, so it doesn't 
count. But Five, Willard, Ewing, and the Saw. Now,

01:05.787 --> 01:07.249
did you all work for the Navy? Yeah. Together. We 
worked for Woods Hole, Oceanographic, but they

01:08.530 --> 01:13.857
were paid by the Navy. Navy contract. Now, then, 
did they, too, go in private enterprise after the

01:15.439 --> 01:18.823
war? No, those three all stayed in the academic 
field. Well, that was one of the second questions

01:24.844 --> 01:31.052
we wanted to ask you, was what persuaded you to 
leave private enterprise and end up in the

01:24.844 --> 01:31.052
academic world? Oh, the last ten years? Mm-hmm. 
Well, frankly, at that time, I wasn't unhappy with

01:33.676 --> 01:42.988
TI, and they weren't unhappy with me, but I got kind 
of fed up. industrial world in the sense that,

01:44.842 --> 01:54.854
again, there's no, I'm not throwing rocks at them, 
but again, it's a person's own philosophy and

01:44.842 --> 01:54.854
interest. And I suddenly realized I was running a 
$12 million division and it brought up

01:54.874 --> 02:02.583
practically nothing. And so what future did I 
have? I built it up maybe to $20 million. And that

02:08.630 --> 02:09.972
sort of lost its interest. to me, anyway. And I 
thought, instead of having paper as my principal

02:11.136 --> 02:17.062
product, it would be fun to have people as my 
principal product. It would be much more

02:17.883 --> 02:19.965
fulfilling and worthwhile. So it wasn't a 
question of economics or anything at that time.

02:25.550 --> 02:30.815
This opportunity opened up here at A&M. Well, it 
had the oceanography department. I was asked to

02:32.957 --> 02:34.699
take it. So I had always planned somewhere down the 
road for too long to go into it. teaching on a

02:39.196 --> 02:41.298
university level. So I just moved up my schedule 
since the offer was a department head in

02:41.919 --> 02:57.796
oceanography, and not too many of those 
available, and accelerated my, you might say,

02:41.919 --> 02:57.796
retirement schedule from industry and go in the 
academic world. Yeah. You suggest, though, that

02:58.116 --> 03:04.683
private exploration should soon match 
government expenses in terms of oceanography.

03:04.704 --> 03:07.026
Does this come from your experience at TI? What was 
that quote again? Well, that in an article you

03:10.660 --> 03:23.755
wrote, you suggested that perhaps private 
enterprise and private exploration should begin

03:10.660 --> 03:23.755
to bear more of the cost of oceanography and the 
developments in oceanography. Does this come

03:24.176 --> 03:25.978
from your experience at TI? You predict that 
government investment will drop in oceanography

03:26.979 --> 03:32.445
and that private investments will increase. 
Yeah, right, because as we look to the sea more and

03:32.665 --> 03:38.532
more for raw materials and everything else that 
the industry has to get involved more. And so

03:42.055 --> 03:46.119
naturally, they should contribute something to 
oceanography. Now, of course, a lot of the

03:46.179 --> 03:57.210
individual companies have been supporting not 
only our department with unrestricted grants and

03:46.179 --> 03:57.210
so on, but other oceanographic institutions as 
well. So they are beginning to play more and more of

03:57.671 --> 04:08.822
their part and their role and carry their share in 
these activities, particularly the oil

03:57.671 --> 04:08.822
companies. Oceanography Department, we're 
getting unrestricted grants and have been for

04:09.359 --> 04:16.468
some time now, ever since I've been here, from 
Humble. And we've had some help from Amoco and the

04:17.309 --> 04:23.617
DuPont people. Just to name a few. So they are 
moving more in that direction. Do you think one of

04:29.845 --> 04:39.096
the attractions for the university, for you, that 
is one of the reasons you appealed to the

04:29.845 --> 04:39.096
university as head of the department, was your 
knowledge of private enterprise? your ability to

04:39.397 --> 04:40.758
secure grants? I wouldn't be at all surprised, 
plus my experience with the government, too,

04:41.099 --> 04:51.609
having been involved indirectly in the 
government through withhold over the Navy

04:41.099 --> 04:51.609
contract and whatnot. Yeah, that is a fact. In 
fact, I came here at an era, you might say, when the

04:53.150 --> 05:08.205
university was looking for people the department 
has with industrial experience, because at that

04:53.150 --> 05:08.205
time, they also got Dr. Spencer in geophysics who 
comes from industry. The dean of the College of

05:08.590 --> 05:15.560
Sciences, Dr. Zener, came from Westinghouse, the 
previous one. And, oh, there were three or four

05:15.580 --> 05:22.870
other people in the middle 60s that came here to 
ministry. The department head of the math

05:23.050 --> 05:27.196
department came to ministry. Whom did you look for 
to bring to your department with you? What sort of

05:31.481 --> 05:33.144
people did you try to hire? Who were they? And what 
did you aim the early department towards being, if

05:33.965 --> 05:37.770
I may? Well, actually, I didn't bring anybody from 
industry per se into the department directly,

05:39.708 --> 05:53.229
although I have hired people since I've been here 
who came from industry, like Dr. Rezak, for

05:39.708 --> 05:53.229
example, who came from Shell.

05:56.674 --> 06:05.027
But one of the first things I wanted to do when I came 
here at that time, there were nine on the faculty,

05:56.674 --> 06:05.027
nine or ten, I forget which, was to broaden it. The 
emphasis had been pretty much on physical

06:06.151 --> 06:17.567
oceanography, with the other branches of 
oceanography thinly represented and being more

06:06.151 --> 06:17.567
or less the handmaidens, I think, for the 
department as a whole. So since I've come here,

06:18.468 --> 06:27.501
rightly or wrongly, depending on who you talk to, I 
have broadened and improved, you might say, the

06:18.468 --> 06:27.501
balance between the different major branches of 
oceanography. Of course, right now, it's not a

06:31.730 --> 06:33.973
numerical balance. We don't divide the 27 faculty 
members by four. We couldn't anyway. We could not

06:38.798 --> 06:39.259
even. But we do have strong chemical oceanography 
group and geological and biological to match an

06:39.859 --> 06:51.413
excellent and strong and well-recognized 
physical oceanography group.

06:56.422 --> 07:04.095
Well, in terms of the government, would you 
explain your work with the President's

06:56.422 --> 07:04.095
Commission?

07:04.115 --> 07:17.738
Well, the President's Commission on Marine 
Resources, etc., etc., was a culmination of an

07:04.115 --> 07:17.738
era, again, where there was a lot of visibility and 
a lot of gung-ho-ness for oceanography. In an

07:18.325 --> 07:24.838
effort to get the thing into a position 
financially and otherwise, it might do more

07:18.325 --> 07:24.838
toward exploiting the oceans. I use the term 
exploit not in the negative sense. And the

07:30.949 --> 07:36.520
legislative history behind the Marine 
Commission goes back about ten years. And it took

07:37.175 --> 07:52.291
about that long to get enough momentum and 
interest and visibility in the Congress and

07:37.175 --> 07:52.291
backing the Congress to come up finally with a bill 
which set up the Marine Council in one hand and the

07:37.175 --> 07:52.291
Marine Commission on the other. And the purpose of 
the Marine Commission was to draw up a plan for the

07:52.311 --> 08:05.224
orderly and accelerated development of the 
oceans, with emphasis on the role, of course, of

07:52.311 --> 08:05.224
the United States And the commission consisted 
of, I guess, 10 or 11 people who were appointed by

08:06.217 --> 08:13.984
the president, which Dr. Stratton was the 
chairman. At that time, he was president emeritus

08:14.545 --> 08:17.407
of MIT. Well, he still is. And I was appointed the 
vice chairman. And actually, there was only one

08:22.172 --> 08:28.938
other oceanographer on the commission, and 
that's Johnny Knauss from Rhode Island. All the

08:29.579 --> 08:34.063
others were from various branches of industry or 
the government. and two legislators,

08:36.035 --> 08:45.925
Congressman Mosier, and who was the senator we had 
on there? So it was a pretty good mix of

08:45.945 --> 09:00.861
legal, political, sociological, and last but no 
means least, two people from the oceanographic

08:45.945 --> 09:00.861
community. try and come to grips with a myriad of 
problems in these different areas that would

09:01.820 --> 09:13.899
naturally arise in trying to develop a plan for the 
orderly acceleration and development and

09:01.820 --> 09:13.899
exploitation of the ocean. What it triggered, 
too, was we were supposed to come up with a plan to

09:14.721 --> 09:23.575
streamline oceanography in the government, 
because at that time there were about 40 or 45

09:24.432 --> 09:34.585
different agencies, sub-agencies, and what have 
you that had their finger in the pie in one way or

09:24.432 --> 09:34.585
another in oceanography or ocean-related 
activities. The theory was to find out about this

09:34.605 --> 09:50.164
fragmentation and then try to put together 
something that would have critical mass but also

09:34.605 --> 09:50.164
have enough clout so it continued to grow and 
develop and be of some good in the form of a single

09:34.605 --> 09:50.164
agency. And the outgrowth of that was what's now 
NOAA. one of the recommendations we made, which is

09:54.402 --> 10:02.473
in the Commerce Department now. But it turned out 
that one of the difficulties was that not only was

10:02.493 --> 10:20.697
there proliferation within the government 
agencies in oceanography, but there was

10:02.493 --> 10:20.697
proliferation within the legislative branch and 
committees and so on, where there were about 40 or

10:02.493 --> 10:20.697
45 agencies involved in oceanography in various 
degrees. More than that, committees. And if we'd

10:22.532 --> 10:35.488
had the guts to make another important 
recommendation, which we didn't,

10:22.532 --> 10:35.488
unfortunately, we would have said that not only 
streamline the agencies that are involved in

10:22.532 --> 10:35.488
oceanography, but streamline the congressional 
committees. Because this way, each of the

10:35.508 --> 10:39.172
agencies now involve oceanography. And NOAA 
isn't the only one, by any means. But it has been

10:40.914 --> 10:43.798
culled down to maybe half a dozen or a dozen. have to 
appear before a whole myriad of different

10:44.757 --> 10:52.986
committees to defend their budget and do what they 
want and hearings and so on. So it's still a can of

10:53.146 --> 10:59.613
worms legislatively, even though otherwise it's 
sort of streamlined down. Although since then,

10:59.633 --> 11:11.305
with all the hue and cry about ecology and 
environment, it's started to proliferate even

10:59.633 --> 11:11.305
more because we have outfits like BLM, Bureau of 
Land Management, that are in the sea that have

10:59.633 --> 11:11.305
never been in the sea before. The USGS has suddenly 
got a pot full of money, and they've gone to see. And

11:16.195 --> 11:23.266
now

11:16.195 --> 11:23.266
the EPA and the IRDA is in the act. So it's about 
time, I guess, to have another commission to call

11:23.286 --> 11:30.757
the attention of the world at large, and the 
taxpayer in particular. We're, again,

11:30.777 --> 11:34.423
proliferating the point with nonsense. Did you 
serve with Treadwell on this commission? No, at

11:37.289 --> 11:51.588
that time, Captain Treadwell was still with the 
Navy as the commander of the Naval Ocean Graphics

11:37.289 --> 11:51.588
Office, although we did lean very heavily on him 
and the staff for data and input that the

11:37.289 --> 11:51.588
commission needed from time to time. He later on 
actually went with the council, the Marine

11:52.850 --> 11:58.738
Council, and he was there when he came with us. The 
council was the governmental counterpart of the

12:00.560 --> 12:06.368
commission. The council consisted of 
representative on a cabinet-level basis from

12:06.618 --> 12:15.085
each of the different departments of the US 
government. They were involved in oceanography,

12:15.105 --> 12:22.691
and they were trying to keep the house in order of 
government agencies involved in oceanography.

12:22.731 --> 12:24.033
Right, heard on that. All right, then. If I 
understand it, the purpose of the commission and

12:24.593 --> 12:32.320
the council, then, was to streamline the 
bureaucratic agencies who had some influence in

12:24.593 --> 12:32.320
the sea. Right, and try and come up with a unified 
agency. With one, which is NOAA. Which is now NOAA,

12:39.302 --> 12:42.247
although it's by no means unified. And the other 
thing was to come up with a plan how to do it and how

12:42.267 --> 13:05.700
much it would cost to, which of the plan which would 
be used to accelerate the orderly development, if

12:42.267 --> 13:05.700
you can do such a thing, accelerate the orderly 
development of the expansion of the ocean, the

12:42.267 --> 13:05.700
potential of the oceans, the wealth of the oceans. 
for use of mankind in general and the U.S. in

13:06.170 --> 13:10.477
particular. Was part of this to establish 
priorities then as to where the national interest

13:11.018 --> 13:19.431
would lie in the oceans, as to which would be the 
more important things to put the money into first?

13:19.811 --> 13:24.438
That would be part of it, to establish priorities.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.363
How did this relate to private industry? What were 
some of the findings, some of the final outcomes of

13:27.403 --> 13:31.890
this as far as how much stimulus should be given to 
the private industry, such as oil research

13:32.174 --> 13:38.843
offshore and other endeavors such as this? Well, 
we had a special subcommittee, you might say, of

13:39.063 --> 13:44.731
the commission. Not just one, we had five of them. 
And one directed toward environment,

13:47.255 --> 13:52.201
environmental questions and problems. And 
another one toward legislative problems. One

13:57.268 --> 13:58.570
toward manpower. And then one toward private 
industry. That was the one I was chairman of, the

14:01.864 --> 14:07.431
subcommittee for private industry. And there was 
a lot of talk about just how you could get private

14:07.451 --> 14:25.435
industry into the act and help it along without 
subsidizing it, like we've subsidized the

14:07.451 --> 14:25.435
railroads and the airlines and the barge canals 
and everything else. One idea there was a group

14:25.988 --> 14:36.902
within the commission tried to push, but didn't 
get too far, was to have something similar to

14:25.988 --> 14:36.902
ComSat. It's a quasi-governmental private 
organization that puts commercial satellites in

14:38.123 --> 14:46.333
the orbit for telephone communication and 
whatnot. And I was one of them. I was a ringleader of

14:47.355 --> 14:51.540
a ComSat for oceanography. But if there was 
another group, for whatever reason, I'll never

14:51.723 --> 15:05.566
know, I guess, unless maybe we just claim that

14:51.723 --> 15:05.566
self-serving and self-seeking manages to squash 
it. And the reason I say that was because there were

15:05.586 --> 15:18.186
a couple of people from government agencies on the 
commission, and they would foresee not wanting to

15:05.586 --> 15:18.186
have too great a role for private industry, 
because that might cut back their role. And so the

15:18.368 --> 15:25.341
ComSat type of development for the oceans never 
materialized. I think it would have been a big step

15:25.361 --> 15:31.913
forward, just as it has been for communications 
and satellites. On the other hand, in all

15:31.933 --> 15:38.605
fairness, AT&T, since the development of ComSat, 
has spent more of their own money laying good

15:39.074 --> 15:47.751
old-fashioned 125-year-old telegraph cables 
across the oceans rather than rely on the

15:39.074 --> 15:47.751
satellites. I don't know. It may not have been the 
fantasy I thought it might have been. Did you make

15:53.603 --> 16:00.677
any specific recommendations coming out of the 
commission that you could quickly and succinctly

16:01.130 --> 16:02.411
Well, let's see. The commission started nine 
years ago, and it lasted for almost two years. One

16:07.095 --> 16:14.722
of the first things we did was extend our life a year 
because we realized we could never solve the

16:07.095 --> 16:14.722
problems properly, come up with a plan in one year. 
But that was one good thing about that bill. It had a

16:17.485 --> 16:23.450
self-destruction, as a friend said on TV, that the 
commission originally had to go out of business in

16:17.485 --> 16:23.450
one year. We did get a one-year extension, but that 
was it. And the same with the Marine Council. one of

16:29.750 --> 16:35.820
the few governmental bills ever written that is 
self-destructing for a commission of an agency.

16:35.840 --> 16:50.745
But what I was leading up to was that it's been, 
well, five or six years or more since I've opened

16:35.840 --> 16:50.745
up, you know, a commission report and the 
particular report of the committee on the private

16:51.383 --> 16:57.350
enterprise, so all I can think of is the 
generalities. Do you have a copy of the commission

16:57.490 --> 16:59.653
report? No. Then I'll give you one. I was just 
reminiscing about the concept of a way to

17:03.938 --> 17:17.695
implement the development and the involvement of 
the private sector into it, because that was one of

17:03.938 --> 17:17.695
the things that got so heavily involved. This

17:18.974 --> 17:34.070
is the summary. In addition to this, there are five 
other volumes, each one representing the summary

17:34.490 --> 17:44.741
of the five different committees I just 
mentioned, or subcommittees. So I think you'll

17:44.781 --> 17:48.745
find in there what you need.

18:04.418 --> 18:05.299
Oh, yeah. The management of the coastal zone was 
another subcommittee, marine resources, global

18:05.339 --> 18:13.111
environment. And there should be some way to... We 
don't actually have one for the committee on

18:13.131 --> 18:24.868
private enterprise. It's...

18:25.950 --> 18:32.940
Well, it's... It's mixed around 100 marine 
resources and around technical operating

18:33.477 --> 18:38.303
services. I do have copies downstairs on the third 
floor of each of these others. If you want to look at

18:44.931 --> 18:46.693
them, I think this is enough. All right. It's 
called Our Nation in the Sea. Yeah.

18:51.979 --> 18:54.382
Let's see if they get some more coffee. I don't 
know.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.723
And also that tribal language. You were making 
some comments about my dialect before, but that

19:01.864 --> 19:06.773
tribal language is most interesting. These are 
people in Washington? Yeah. Six words will do it,

19:11.321 --> 19:13.545
they'll never use one. Yeah. They all have things 
like... Were there any particular congressmen

19:17.131 --> 19:24.004
who offered you, collectively or individually, 
proper support for the commission? Yeah, well,

19:24.305 --> 19:32.360
Congressman Mosher, I think, was really the 
outstanding one, from a standpoint of a

19:24.305 --> 19:32.360
congressman. And then in the senatorial side, 
there was Magnuson, I think he was, Magnuson from

19:32.380 --> 19:46.667
the state of Washington, and Kell from Rhode 
Island, two of the mainstays.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.733
They were all very helpful. So the Commission 
lasted for two years, you met once a month for

19:50.753 --> 19:57.001
several days at a time in Washington, and then 
brought in subcommittee reports. Right. Oh, then

19:57.962 --> 20:12.501
also we had hearings, but of course the hearings 
were not for the Commission as such, but we had

19:57.962 --> 20:12.501
subcommittee hearings all over the country, 
usually on Seaport and the County of Great Lakes

19:57.962 --> 20:12.501
and Seaport City. Would you want to judge this 
effectiveness of the President's Commission?

20:19.570 --> 20:20.231
Yeah.

20:22.814 --> 20:24.917
It's all the blood, sweat, and tears I've put in 
this thing. Its completion couldn't have come at a

20:25.577 --> 20:44.201
worse time because it was, after all, the Lyndon B. 
Johnson Commission in the eyes of the

20:25.577 --> 20:44.201
Republicans, although there were, at that time, 
two Republicans on it, Baird and myself, although

20:25.577 --> 20:44.201
I've since no longer claimed to be a Republican. 
I'm an independent. But be that as it may, if you can

20:45.710 --> 21:02.436
answer your timing aspect of it, it couldn't have 
come at a worse time because no matter how good it

20:45.710 --> 21:02.436
might have been the Bible itself, it was generated 
by opposing party, in effect. And had Humphrey

21:05.467 --> 21:14.666
been elected, I'm sure there was another person, 
if Humphrey had been elected, he would have used it

21:05.467 --> 21:14.666
as a blueprint in the Bible and implemented it to 
the best of his ability. He probably is the most

21:14.686 --> 21:19.877
outstanding, most helpful person in this whole 
business. I don't know why I didn't think of him

21:19.897 --> 21:21.821
before in that connection. By then, when Nixon got 
through president, He wouldn't have anything to

21:24.674 --> 21:39.220
do with it because, for the reason I just 
mentioned, what he did was set up a series of task

21:24.674 --> 21:39.220
forces to take our commission report and 
practically rework it and start all over again.

21:39.240 --> 21:43.307
And this got a lot of people mad, including my wife, 
who wrote him a letter and said that We spent $2

21:43.658 --> 21:50.746
million of taxpayers' money and untold months of 
my time away from her, and she thought this was

21:43.658 --> 21:50.746
stupid to reinvent the wheel. And I laughed at her 
when she wrote the letter. I said, no, it won't do

21:55.011 --> 21:56.272
any good. I said, you won't get an answer. I said, 
you do get an answer if you're formal and say thank

21:57.614 --> 22:01.017
you for writing us a letter. But she never even got a 
postcard acknowledging it. So these guys did go

22:04.501 --> 22:09.266
and reinvent the wheel, and fortunately not to the 
extent of $2 million. But we did spend a lot of time.

22:12.920 --> 22:20.290
They did invite some of the commission members in 
as consultants and make comments on what they came

22:12.920 --> 22:20.290
up with and whatnot. And so, in all due respect, not 
to Nixon, but to these cohorts that he had on these

22:20.310 --> 22:36.193
task forces, they did recommend to him to 
implement the commission along the lines, of

22:20.310 --> 22:36.193
course, that they had thought up and dreamt up in 
what now is NOAA. The other thing that we had

22:38.468 --> 22:45.214
recommended, in addition to the NOAA type of 
operation, was also a NATOA, the Advisory

22:38.468 --> 22:45.214
Committee. But we said that the Advisory 
Committee to NOAA should report directly to the

22:46.015 --> 22:53.582
president, so they wouldn't have any strings 
attached to it. Instead of that, they modified

22:54.022 --> 23:00.508
that to having the COA report directly to the Dr. 
White, the head of NOAA. And he pays the travel and

23:01.028 --> 23:04.391
expenses and the consulting. So naturally, he 
gets the kind of We party won. No, no, but I'm into

23:09.461 --> 23:10.503
that. I mean, he's in business and that's his job. 
Although when I told him about it after it

23:15.310 --> 23:19.816
happened, he said, no, nothing like that. Well, 
that's the postmortem, you might say, on what

23:22.299 --> 23:31.392
happened to the commission in detail after we 
changed administrations. Now, it was a sad day for

23:32.333 --> 23:37.699
oceanography when Humphrey wasn't elected 
president, because he really would have pushed

23:32.333 --> 23:37.699
it. I think Nixon's advisors figured how many 
boats do the fish have? Forget about it. Are you

23:47.229 --> 23:55.118
satisfied presently with the sort of support the 
government is giving the development of

23:47.229 --> 23:55.118
oceanography?

23:56.043 --> 24:03.275
I don't know what I could really answer that 
because I'm not an unbiased, objective person

23:56.043 --> 24:03.275
when it comes to that. Human nature being what it 
is, my answer is no. You can say I have an ax to grind,

24:10.165 --> 24:14.953
but you just look at the numbers. We're worse off 
now if we use 1966 dollars or 68 dollars in hard

24:15.013 --> 24:23.687
dollars than we were then. Sure, the actual number 
of dollars that the government is putting in

24:23.853 --> 24:30.682
oceanography you can show is more than it was in 
1966-68. There hasn't been enough added, but the

24:31.643 --> 24:36.169
buying power is even equivalent to 1966-68. As 
recently as 1970, our ONR contract was $1 million.

24:45.221 --> 24:48.806
Since then, it's dropped off to $400,000 or 
$500,000. And not only that, but we're fortunate

24:49.006 --> 24:51.970
to get that much because Other institutions have 
been dropped entirely. ONR put it the other way

24:55.475 --> 24:56.996
around. ONR has quit funding a number of other 
institutions. Same way with NSF. They're right on

25:04.584 --> 25:06.666
down the line. But what has happened since this big 
ecology and environmental bust has descended on

25:06.686 --> 25:18.558
us, the money is now going into not blue water or 
deep water oceanography. It's going into outfits

25:18.578 --> 25:22.362
like EPA, BLM, What does BLM stand for? Bureau of 
Land Management. And so from that standpoint,

25:27.005 --> 25:34.373
there has been a big increase in funding in 
oceanography. Of course, again, it depends on how

25:34.393 --> 25:37.696
you want to define oceanography. I mean, here we go 
in the bays and estuaries and it's still

25:37.716 --> 25:43.261
oceanography. But it's not oceanography in the 
sense that we hope to develop the resources from

25:43.281 --> 25:52.230
the oceans that we had in mind when we drew up the 
plan for the commission. And, of course, this has

25:53.122 --> 25:55.245
helped us as a department. We probably, again, 
because we have access to our own submersible and

25:55.445 --> 26:14.353
have a unique capability, we've gotten, by now, 
I'd say well over a million and a half dollars worth

25:55.445 --> 26:14.353
of research out of these new outfits like DLM and 
the Marine Branch of the USGS and whatnot. One of

26:16.797 --> 26:21.604
the reasons it's difficult to answer your 
question, yes or no, is because it goes into your

26:16.797 --> 26:21.604
definition. What's oceanography?

26:25.889 --> 26:29.194
Where it all comes from and just what the total 
oceanography dollar is. If you want to include

26:29.594 --> 26:43.193
things on these new agencies in the oceanography, 
maybe we've gone up a little bit, but nothing in

26:29.594 --> 26:43.193
line of what was necessary to implement the plan 
that we're talking about in the commission

26:29.594 --> 26:43.193
report. If I recall correctly, President Nixon, 
shortly before his rapid decline and demise, came

26:44.253 --> 26:58.785
up with a pledge for working on the energy crisis by 
pouring money into science to work on the energy

26:44.253 --> 26:58.785
problem that was supposed to be on the scale of the 
Manhattan Project. And I'm wondering if anything

26:59.447 --> 27:01.772
ever came of that. And I won't answer that question 
myself, but I wonder if anything came of that and

27:03.001 --> 27:11.712
what offshoots came off in oceanography for 
energy. Well, what came of that, I think, is

27:11.732 --> 27:25.851
indirectly fed back in oceanography was a big pot 
of money given the U.S. Geological Survey to do

27:11.732 --> 27:25.851
work on a continental shelf in connection with 
finding oil and getting data to help regulate the

27:11.732 --> 27:25.851
oil economy and so on. They've had more money now. 
They don't know what to do with it. Like Dr.

27:28.634 --> 27:32.940
Baumann, who used to be on the faculty, went 
with... US Geos in Menlo Park as part of that

27:33.612 --> 27:45.646
recruiting program that they put on across the 
nation for people to work on the money they've

27:33.612 --> 27:45.646
gotten and the projects that they have since then. 
ERDA is another one. They've gotten quite a bit of

27:47.909 --> 27:55.418
money for, again, you might say if you want to call 
it oceanography because it is in the saltwater

27:47.909 --> 27:55.418
area. which they didn't have before for this type 
of purpose. I don't know whether you're aware of

27:59.097 --> 28:03.522
that workshop we have next year for two days. We got 
a contract not too long ago from IRDA, which is a

28:04.142 --> 28:17.476
management contract for oceanographic research 
necessary to help IRDA solve their problems in the

28:04.142 --> 28:17.476
Gulf of Mexico. And we're having a two-day 
workshop and bringing in about 40 or 45 people from

28:17.496 --> 28:25.725
the whole Gulf of Mexico area in oceanographic 
institutions and marine orient institutions to,

28:26.667 --> 28:47.396
through this workshop, come up with ideas of what 
ERDA needs to do in a way of not so much a data

28:26.667 --> 28:47.396
gathering, per se, the way BLM and EPA and the 
others are doing, but solve processes involved in

28:26.667 --> 28:47.396
energy-related activities in the Gulf of Mexico, 
in our particular case. Not only oil, but nuclear

28:47.937 --> 28:53.164
power plants, wave power and wave, and so on. 
Professor Spilhaus seemed to think that

28:54.173 --> 29:02.023
environmental legislation interfered with 
proper exploitation of fuel resources. Would you

29:02.083 --> 29:02.884
agree with that?

29:05.988 --> 29:19.725
Well, it had and it should to a certain extent, but 
it shouldn't interfere to the extent of being

29:05.988 --> 29:19.725
unrealistic to the point where we throw the baby 
out with the bathwater, that we have a wonderful

29:05.988 --> 29:19.725
environment with no energy coming from it. I mean, 
there's business about strip mining, for

29:21.443 --> 29:27.332
example, on land, and leaving it to the conditions 
that it has in the past. I don't approve of that. But

29:29.515 --> 29:33.822
on the other hand, the pendulum always overshoots 
and overreacts. And what they're talking about

29:33.862 --> 29:44.839
now, to get the thing back into shape after the land 
has been used for strip mining, is just

29:33.862 --> 29:44.839
unrealistic and burgeoning territory. But I feel 
strongly that they should put the thing back into

29:44.859 --> 29:50.387
some semblance of use for other purposes. But some 
of the constraints that are laid out, like an

29:51.262 --> 30:00.250
environmental impact statement and so on, it's 
just entirely unrealistic if you want to have any

29:51.262 --> 30:00.250
energy at an economic price. This last series of 
questions lead for me to ask for comments on four

30:02.072 --> 30:07.397
things from you. What would you suppose the future 
is going to be in oil and the environment in terms of

30:07.797 --> 30:12.982
oceanography? Do you expect more or less 
restrictions or more things asked of you in terms

30:13.002 --> 30:20.188
of offshore drillings? Well, I don't think I can 
ask for even more things they're doing now on the

30:21.400 --> 30:34.496
environmental impact statement as manifested by 
agencies like the USGS, the Bureau of Land

30:21.400 --> 30:34.496
Management, and so on. They have to do more than 
what we're asked to do now. I don't mean actually in

30:38.561 --> 30:43.948
dollars or amounts, but I mean in additional 
things.
