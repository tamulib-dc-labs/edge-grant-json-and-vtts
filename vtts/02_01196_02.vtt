WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:13.072
I

00:02.579 --> 00:13.072
guess it was 16 years ago.

00:14.533 --> 00:18.258
He wanted me to meet George Mitchell. So I met 
George Mitchell, and at that time, he had become

00:18.278 --> 00:28.009
very much involved in the issue of sustainable 
societies and limits to growth. And so I got

00:28.971 --> 00:31.033
involved with the Club of Rome. and decided he 
would commit himself to these five biannual

00:32.313 --> 00:38.280
conferences, international conferences 
dealing with the issue. At that time, he called it

00:38.320 --> 00:40.343
Limits to Growth. And I knew absolutely nothing 
about that and cared less. I thought it was

00:45.208 --> 00:53.438
futurism and I wasn't going to get involved in 
that, but President Hoffman persuaded me

00:45.208 --> 00:53.438
otherwise. And I'm delighted he did. Anyway, as a 
result of that first interaction, over the last,

01:01.186 --> 01:12.081
ever since then, there's just been a series of 
activities and projects that I've gotten, I've

01:01.186 --> 01:12.081
been involved with George Mitchell. To finally 
about, I don't know, maybe six years ago, in the

01:12.662 --> 01:29.826
early stages of HARC,

01:12.662 --> 01:29.826
he asked me to serve as interim director of HARC, 
interim president. And during the next few

01:30.346 --> 01:37.697
months, the search began for a president, and Skip 
Porter was recruited. And when I was done with

01:38.779 --> 01:45.228
that, he asked me to do something else related to 
his dream of having a campus out here. He had this

01:45.248 --> 01:50.897
gift on the table at the University of Houston for 
all these years, and then he had to come with it. And

01:52.519 --> 01:55.864
that was followed by something related to the 
research for us and finally he and I talked and I

01:57.397 --> 02:07.832
said that I think I was ready for the switch. I just 
wanted to do something different. I thought this

02:11.477 --> 02:15.964
was a wonderful opportunity to enter the private 
sector and really earn some big money. My timing

02:17.045 --> 02:18.908
was perfect. I hadn't been here two weeks when the 
energy market collapsed Real estate went down the

02:22.220 --> 02:24.263
tubes. And he was kind enough not to hold me 
responsible. University life looked pretty

02:27.587 --> 02:29.109
good. University life looked better than ever. 
When was that? Was that about 83? Yeah, 83, 84. And

02:35.637 --> 02:36.598
it was interesting. His major concern was giving 
up tenure. He had this thing about tenure was

02:43.727 --> 02:48.413
probably a, what? He's got tremendous, 
tremendous respect. I think sometimes it borders

02:52.165 --> 02:55.489
on naivety about university life. I mean, I think 
he really does. The idea of somebody leaving the

02:59.294 --> 03:09.727
university, particularly with that tenure, and 
going into this risky, chancy, free market world.

03:10.969 --> 03:13.693
He was genuinely concerned about that. You know, I 
told him that was not something that he had to be

03:14.193 --> 03:18.619
concerned with, that that was a decision. that I 
could make. What he had to be concerned with was

03:20.192 --> 03:25.218
coming up with something that I would find 
attractive enough. And he did, and that was not a

03:25.238 --> 03:27.200
problem. So I've been here ever since as vice 
president for institutional development. It's a

03:35.110 --> 03:37.193
wonderful job. I mean, it's a reflection of 
Mitchell. Who else would hire a PhD in sociology?

03:42.980 --> 03:43.380
Who knows? Nothing about real estate knows 
nothing about energy. It's kind of interesting,

03:46.824 --> 03:48.927
because I have a lot of colleagues. and say, you 
know, I've been thinking seriously about getting

03:49.480 --> 03:53.525
into the private sector. How do you do that? And I 
said, listen, find another Mitchell. That's all I

03:57.731 --> 03:59.353
can tell you. So I continued to work with him on a 
variety of activities. How precisely, you

04:04.861 --> 04:11.229
mentioned that Holmes, was it President Holmes? 
Hoffman. Hoffman. Introduced you to George

04:14.193 --> 04:15.455
Mitchell. What was that initial, what did you do 
initially? Initially was to help him design,

04:19.400 --> 04:28.072
structure his first biannual conference on, it's 
called Limits to Growth. Oh. And that's when the

04:29.113 --> 04:42.291
Club of Rome was involved, and that first one, 
Dennis Meadows, who at Dartmouth had written

04:29.113 --> 04:42.291
several books on limits to growth and sustainable 
societies. There was a lot of interest in that

04:42.331 --> 04:47.618
topic. And George came up with some very, very nice 
prizes, five prizes of $10,000 each, and really

04:48.509 --> 05:04.055
put up a lot of money to do this for his conference. 
And then after the first conference on Limits to

05:05.677 --> 05:13.110
Growth, George realized that after all, he was 
calling for more and more energy exploration. He

05:13.671 --> 05:15.073
was a land developer. And he really didn't believe 
that we had reached the limits to growth. But he was

05:19.497 --> 05:24.042
much more comfortable with the notion of 
sustainable society. And he's got a tremendous

05:24.282 --> 05:29.468
commitment to protecting the environment, the 
ecology. You don't just have to look around here.

05:31.711 --> 05:33.312
The guy is very, very reluctant. I mean, there's 
many, many opportunities for him to sell land at a

05:33.332 --> 05:39.319
very great profit. He won't simply because of the 
needs or putting buildings, commercial

05:43.117 --> 05:49.664
buildings, and giving up frontage and so on. So I 
was involved with that. Then he had this great

05:50.905 --> 05:59.233
vision and the need for economic diversification 
for Houston and Texas. And he became very much

06:00.114 --> 06:10.204
aware that there were a lot of exciting and viable 
inventions and discoveries coming out of Texas,

06:00.114 --> 06:10.204
particularly out of the universities. But much of 
it was going elsewhere because there was no

06:10.859 --> 06:14.663
venture capital here. The only thing the banks 
were interested in was investing in oil. He once

06:20.069 --> 06:26.435
told a story of some guy walks into a bank and says, I 
have a cure for cancer. And they say, we can't do

06:26.495 --> 06:28.297
anything for you. And the other guy walks in and 
says, I have a black box. He says, what's in there?

06:31.200 --> 06:32.422
He says, a new way of getting oil. He says, here's a 
million dollars.

06:37.268 --> 06:43.656
He then formed the Woodlands Venture Capital 
Company and put up five million dollars. Hired a

06:43.676 --> 06:46.279
guy to really start. Fifteen's over there. Oh, 
fifteen's over there. It's five and then five and

06:48.903 --> 06:50.865
then five. It's a total of fifteen. Hired Marty 
Sutter, who came in to run Woodlands Venture

06:52.207 --> 06:56.812
Capital. And just about the same time, We started 
to think of this consortium of Texas universities

06:59.223 --> 07:19.504
that could come together at the Woodlands and 
really work on big-ticket items, complement one

06:59.223 --> 07:19.504
another, and create a major basic research center 
that would have spin-offs for

06:59.223 --> 07:19.504
commercialization. And you got involved in that 
early on? Right, right, yeah. I was asked, I

07:23.548 --> 07:27.492
chaired the feasibility committee. At that time, 
UT was not involved. A&M

07:30.667 --> 07:36.376
was involved, U of H, and Rice. And they had very 
good people on the committee, all of whom decided

07:38.340 --> 07:48.457
that they were so busy that they couldn't devote 
the time to this that was really necessary. So we

07:48.977 --> 07:50.560
went out and we got A.D. to do the feasibility 
study, and that was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

07:55.157 --> 08:00.363
They got $50,000 to find out it was a viable idea, 
and they said, yeah, this is a really viable idea.

08:00.383 --> 08:04.649
And they came up with a master plan, and most of the 
plan was disregarded anyway. But it was like, this

08:05.270 --> 08:09.736
now has been blessed. At the same time, George 
decided, geez, while I'm doing this over here, I

08:09.756 --> 08:17.526
really ought to do something, and I'll just do this 
on the medical side. So he went to A.D. Little again

08:18.400 --> 08:21.825
and said, take a look at the medical. And his dream 
there was that something like Hark, but a

08:21.865 --> 08:28.293
collection of the medical research. Do you see 
both of these things as having really emanated

08:29.996 --> 08:33.621
from George Mitchell per se? Yeah. Where was the 
input? No, it was him. It's him. The whole

08:38.367 --> 08:43.714
superconductor, supercollider, again, never 
would have happened without Mitchell. I mean, the

08:43.734 --> 08:47.800
guys at A&M, like Russ Houston and Peter McIntyre, 
no question about it. played a very significant

08:48.202 --> 08:49.703
role. But if George hadn't been there at the 
beginning and said, here's a facility, I'll put up

08:49.723 --> 09:06.499
money, here's housing for the scientists, I'll do 
this matching part, because I remember Russ Youth

08:49.723 --> 09:06.499
and I went to Chicago and signed that first 
contract with DOE, or the first magnet. Oh, did

09:06.519 --> 09:07.100
you? Okay. And George had to make some serious 
commitments before. There was nothing here.

09:13.306 --> 09:15.508
Yeah, so... Yeah, that's, those things I know. I 
know that Hark and the medical, the research

09:19.809 --> 09:27.320
center, medically, never would have happened. 
That's an interesting, it's almost a side issue

09:27.340 --> 09:37.073
that we have to, at some point, poke into, I guess, 
is that whole, because we got from Skip, what was

09:27.340 --> 09:37.073
it, chronology? Yeah. Of the development of the 
super... Which is a story that hasn't been written

09:41.500 --> 09:45.966
yet. Yeah. Well, one

09:46.657 --> 09:59.090
of the first things that happened was, of course, 
the whole business of a site. And the first money

10:00.211 --> 10:03.214
for that came from the governor's office. And that 
was to look at various sites. That was before the US

10:05.857 --> 10:15.567
Congress and the Department of Energy ever made 
the decision that we are going to go ahead and do a

10:05.857 --> 10:15.567
national search. what the guys here were pushing 
for was, we've got, we're working on the magnets,

10:16.694 --> 10:24.163
let's go find a site in Texas. And they got 
everybody, some of the people excited in the

10:24.664 --> 10:33.274
legislature, so they think at that time they came 
up with $400,000 to do a site study, six or seven

10:24.664 --> 10:33.274
sites. I don't know, Skip, give you the... I don't 
think we have to write it down, no, it's a search and

10:35.857 --> 10:38.481
sell. But you're right, that is an interesting 
story. And how... and how the universities work

10:45.787 --> 10:52.074
together on it is also, it's another volume. Yeah, 
I'm sure. You know how tough it is getting

10:54.216 --> 11:00.943
departments to work together in a single 
university.

11:00.963 --> 11:05.949
And what relevance did these in the park, for 
example, and the medical center have to the

11:00.963 --> 11:05.949
woodlands, do you think? And you may have put 
yourself in Mitchell's mind, but what part of the

11:06.129 --> 11:12.756
package is this? as an economic development type 
thing? Yeah, yeah. Is it for Woodlands growth or

11:16.057 --> 11:30.252
just... Yeah, I mean, George does a lot of things 
that are really quite altruistic, but there's

11:16.057 --> 11:30.252
always an intrinsic base. I mean... As an economic 
historian... He's very shrewd in the good things

11:33.375 --> 11:35.457
he does. Yeah. The idea is, for the Woodlands, is 
the name of the game here is job creation. you

11:44.444 --> 11:50.291
create jobs here, then you're going to have all the 
other institutions, and you're going to sell

11:44.444 --> 11:50.291
homes. And as that grows, it'll act as a magnet, 
attract other companies, etc.

11:58.460 --> 11:59.941
And he recognized that. And he also felt there was a 
real need. He was very much taken by the North

12:05.067 --> 12:10.333
Carolina research tribe there. That was a great 
thing to do. His view was, We've got great

12:14.077 --> 12:19.244
universities in Texas, is there any way to pull 
those together and have something analogous?

12:22.709 --> 12:34.666
But yeah, with HARC, I think there George felt that 
having the HARC presence may act as some sort of

12:22.709 --> 12:34.666
magnet to bring in companies. Because it was very 
clear that HARC was going to do contract research

12:35.447 --> 12:43.358
for the most part, and basic research, and 
hopefully there would be some spin-offs. But HARC

12:44.789 --> 12:57.125
has pretty much remained...

12:44.789 --> 12:57.125
We're very, very sensitive about using HARC as a 
real estate initiative. Right, yeah. Skip made

12:57.826 --> 12:59.488
that very clear, too. Are you still on the board? 
No. No. No. No, that's... When

13:06.478 --> 13:12.025
I came to work for George, I went off that. And it's 
better that way. Yeah. And I understand where

13:14.776 --> 13:26.679
Skip's coming from because in many respects he's 
trying to raise funds and people tend to see

13:14.776 --> 13:26.679
everything in the woodlands as George's playpen. 
I think that's kind of overly overdone. But

13:33.011 --> 13:36.598
however, so we really is at arm's length. We don't 
really get involved with that. In the marketing

13:42.163 --> 13:49.774
materials we put together when we talk about the 
research for us, we'll have a picture of HARC and

13:42.163 --> 13:49.774
we'll talk about what they do. But we're much more 
likely to utilize the medical, the biotech and

13:50.796 --> 14:05.718
biomed research labs and companies out here as a 
magnet for drawing than we are HARC. And they're

14:07.409 --> 14:10.474
they're far less sensitive to this. In fact, 
Dominic Lamb is probably one of the best real

14:10.494 --> 14:14.840
estate people we got out here. In fact, he overdoes 
it. We interviewed him. Dominic? Yeah, well, make

14:21.030 --> 14:26.398
sure you got him on the front page, otherwise... 
That's right, I said that. Our problem with

14:26.418 --> 14:32.407
Dominic very often is that he's got to make the 
point that there are other people out here other

14:26.418 --> 14:32.407
than Dominic. He's so colorful, he's so hilarious 
that... Now what is your major role in

14:36.451 --> 14:40.436
institutional development? Just what do you do? 
Well, that's a good question. No. I have primary

14:47.045 --> 14:53.614
responsibility for our relationships with the 
institutions and the medical center. I play a

14:53.634 --> 14:57.960
major role in negotiating their moving their 
basic research. Is there an advisory council now?

15:00.498 --> 15:01.920
for that relationship at all? We once had, at the 
beginning, kind of a woodlands research forest

15:02.701 --> 15:07.046
advisory group. But that was at the very 
beginning. But the thing has grown. There are now

15:11.371 --> 15:13.394
25 companies. And I just recently put this 
together, in fact. You might find that there's

15:17.238 --> 15:18.300
some.

15:21.183 --> 15:29.273
We just put that together for a board, a Mitchell 
board.

15:29.877 --> 15:38.850
The thing has grown to the point where at

15:29.877 --> 15:38.850
the beginning it was like a company town. So we took 
responsibility for organizing and that, but it's

15:40.512 --> 15:53.571
grown to the point now that the CEOs of all of the 
companies in the Woodlands Research Force have

15:40.512 --> 15:53.571
their own organization and they meet about once a 
month. And that's a very good reason because while

15:53.591 --> 15:58.298
some of them are mature companies, a number of them 
are in the early stages of development. So rather

16:03.562 --> 16:17.763
than each of them, you know, with six or seven or ten 
employees putting together their own health

16:03.562 --> 16:17.763
plans, insurance plans, that consortium they 
form allows them to do things on a group basis. And

16:17.783 --> 16:19.866
they also get together just to share ideas. The 
second thing that's emerged from that is a group

16:22.110 --> 16:25.635
called assets. which is an association of the 
scientists and engineers and technicians out

16:25.902 --> 16:29.966
here. And they meet four or five times a year on a 
fairly informal basis. They'll have somebody

16:36.932 --> 16:42.418
come in as a lecturer, and they'll have beer 
together or lunch together. And that is an

16:42.618 --> 16:47.863
organization that recently got started, and 
we're delighted about that. And you had no role,

16:48.483 --> 16:52.467
basically, in starting those kind of 
arrangements?

16:54.286 --> 17:07.448
We had the role of planting the seed, and I was very 
much involved in founding of the Forum Club of

16:54.286 --> 17:07.448
Houston, if you know about that. Oh, it's 
something analogous to the Commonwealth Club in

17:07.508 --> 17:12.276
San Francisco. It's now got about 3,700 members, 
and they're corporate people. And they gather

17:16.713 --> 17:21.579
together 15 or 20 times a year, and major speakers 
are brought in. Like today, the one I'm going to

17:21.599 --> 17:29.389
downtown today is O'Reilly, who is the head of EPA, 
and James Schlesinger is coming in January. And

17:29.409 --> 17:30.991
they usually get anywhere from 800 to 1,200. We 
really wanted to try to do something analogous to

17:31.392 --> 17:38.921
that out here with a focus on science and 
technology. And now that group is reaching out to

17:39.903 --> 17:44.188
compact employees, So we're trying to go beyond 
just here. What was the seed that you planted for

17:47.720 --> 17:50.963
this asset group? I mean, what exactly did you do? 
Well, we had this advisory group, and then I went to

17:52.284 --> 18:10.159
a couple of the guys who were scientists, 
principal investigators, either in one of the

17:52.284 --> 18:10.159
university research labs or one of the companies, 
and said, you know, we now have over 200 PhD

17:52.284 --> 18:10.159
engineers and scientists out here, and many more 
technicians. It would be a good idea to start

18:10.740 --> 18:14.783
getting these guys together in regular meetings. 
We would find it helpful, for example,

18:15.387 --> 18:29.046
one of my jobs is to help facilitate

18:15.387 --> 18:29.046
the efforts of these people to reach their goals. 
And I've done that in two ways. I'm very active in

18:32.251 --> 18:39.040
connecting some of these startup companies with 
Japanese investors. So we now have seven or eight

18:40.022 --> 18:44.668
different Japanese companies that have invested 
either in some of the basic research going out

18:45.003 --> 18:49.549
here, or some of these startup companies. Either 
R&D, equity, or handling marketing license. Are

18:53.654 --> 18:57.218
you working with Sutter closely in that, or is it 
pretty independent? No, it's pretty independent

18:57.238 --> 19:01.964
because... That's a different world. Yeah, that 
was just a fluke. Just three years ago I was invited

19:05.688 --> 19:11.095
to the Japanese government to spend a month in 
Japan. touring and learning about MIDI and their

19:11.547 --> 19:14.270
companies and everything. And that really got me 
started. And so now I've been there five more times

19:17.314 --> 19:22.059
since then. And we're doing a lot of joint venture. 
We're initiating a lot of joint venture work with

19:24.922 --> 19:29.067
the Japanese and the Pacific Rim. But if we can get 
capital into some of these startup companies and

19:29.087 --> 19:41.301
enhance their chances of survival, that's all for 
the best for us. They stay alive and hire more

19:41.483 --> 19:46.410
people who buy more houses, who attract more 
attention. And also, it draws attention to the

19:46.951 --> 19:49.815
Japanese. So at this point, we have a Japanese 
pharmaceutical company that is probably going to

19:49.895 --> 19:56.805
be opening an office here. It will be the first 
Japanese pharmaceutical company in the entire

19:56.845 --> 20:00.930
Southwest. Our real estate people have just about 
signed. They've already signed. It's going to be

20:07.359 --> 20:09.162
finalized on the 19th. a major real estate venture 
with a Japanese company on five buildings out

20:09.766 --> 20:18.334
here. So that's one of the ways that we try, or 
through my role, try to enhance and facilitate

20:18.354 --> 20:29.303
their work. The other is, a number of them will say, 
we need a library out here. We need a library to be

20:34.128 --> 20:39.132
responsive to our proposal writing or whatever 
else we're doing.

20:42.537 --> 20:58.972
We're not going to invest in a major university 
technical library here, but what we have said to

20:42.537 --> 20:58.972
them, get your group together, try to identify a 
set of generic journals or some electronic ways of

20:42.537 --> 20:58.972
retrieving library materials and we'll work with 
you. Not that we're going to pay for it, we may fund

20:59.953 --> 21:08.440
part of it, we may help build a facility for it, but 
those are some of the ways that we need to group.

21:09.381 --> 21:10.502
Another reason that But that group is very, very 
helpful to us in helping us to identify other

21:11.579 --> 21:19.110
companies or other areas that we need to get 
involved in. And the other nice thing about that

21:20.031 --> 21:30.006
group is they're terribly helpful when we're 
bringing in somebody who's considering

21:20.031 --> 21:30.006
potential payment. And these are guys, by the way, 
that you can't give them a script. You can't buy

21:36.155 --> 21:39.139
them. Most of them are very, very helpful.

21:45.254 --> 21:51.284
So the more of that sense of community that we 
build, the better it is. They have an opportunity

21:51.304 --> 21:57.954
to interact with one another, and as a result of 
that, they discover new opportunities. And I

21:58.114 --> 21:59.837
don't know if Skip told you about Bay Med. No, I 
don't think he did. Well, Russ Euston was over

22:02.682 --> 22:06.848
there working at his magnets. Across the way here, 
Baylor College of Medicine has a magnetic

22:07.334 --> 22:12.440
resonance imaging center. And they were doing 
theoretical work on imaging. And so they had a

22:16.024 --> 22:27.717
need, and Russ had the technology and the concept, 
and they built this iron shield magnet together,

22:16.024 --> 22:27.717
formed a company called BayMed, and now are 
looking for investors. And based on the stuff I've

22:27.797 --> 22:33.664
heard, they've got a pretty good chance of making 
it. Surgimedics, which is a manufacturer...

22:36.832 --> 22:45.962
Optic Fibers for Laser Research has connected 
with Mike Berry's Laser Application Research

22:36.832 --> 22:45.962
Center over there at Hark. We've got a 
telecommunications company out here called

22:48.465 --> 23:02.501
Williams Telecommunications have now found a way 
of connecting with one of the biotech companies

22:48.465 --> 23:02.501
out here, Biomed companies that is involved in 
optics, fiber optics, a company called Optex. So

23:03.742 --> 23:06.045
there's a lot of You know how in a university you've 
got guys in physics working on one thing, guys in

23:08.472 --> 23:18.103
chemistry working on another, and if they knew 
what they each were working on, it would maximize

23:08.472 --> 23:18.103
their chances of success, even in getting funds. 
Yeah, so here you're building vehicles on those

23:18.123 --> 23:21.206
bridges. But again, they've made it very clear 
that they don't want that to be a Woodlands

23:22.147 --> 23:30.096
Corporation activity. And we've made it equally 
clear, right, we don't want that either. Well, you

23:34.392 --> 23:44.782
know, what I see here is something totally 
different to that new community thing that you

23:34.392 --> 23:44.782
read about in the Morgan King book, which I assume 
you've read and have sort of a take-off point in its

23:34.392 --> 23:44.782
oral history. But this is a whole new world, a whole 
new ballgame that's developing out here in terms

23:44.802 --> 23:50.787
of this kind of relationship of business. I think 
so. I think that's why we... Porter, for example, I

23:52.168 --> 23:57.793
know, you know, he said, we're far beyond the 
wooden. We're really thinking not just

23:57.874 --> 24:01.697
nationally, but internationally of what we try to 
do. And they're doing a lot internationally, I

24:01.717 --> 24:03.859
think. That's partly Skip, too, I know. But by the 
same token, there is something there. And with

24:09.667 --> 24:11.571
your Japanese... In my view on that, I don't like 
it. Okay. But...

24:15.620 --> 24:22.135
Whatever thinking is going on over there, It 
wouldn't be going on if it wasn't for George

24:22.739 --> 24:26.605
Mitchell. I may admit it. That's one thing that has 
come out of almost every candidate. In fact, we

24:32.194 --> 24:35.178
have been in a lot of meetings like this with you. 
And the photo ring with George Mitchell. That's

24:37.922 --> 24:45.374
purely coincidental, but that gives you a sense of 
his involvement, acting involvement. He's

24:45.394 --> 24:48.038
involved in the carpeting of the San Luis Hotel. 
Yeah. One of the things you gotta learn out here is

24:49.423 --> 24:53.909
when George calls you, what other six people has he 
called? Yeah. And given the same assignment. Oh,

24:57.313 --> 25:00.377
really? Yeah. So your role then, in a way, seems a 
little amorphous. Yeah. It's the way you've

25:06.625 --> 25:07.807
described it. I'm kind of like a cultural 
anthropologist. One of my roles is I act as the

25:14.309 --> 25:22.581
interpreter and translator between the real 
estate people and the scientists. I'm trying to

25:22.601 --> 25:27.227
benefit the people and the scientists.

25:28.389 --> 25:41.347
My role also is once a company is here or a 
university,

25:28.389 --> 25:41.347
a company that has spun out of one of the 
universities, I work with them on a regular basis.

25:42.749 --> 25:43.911
I visit with them. How are things going? What do you 
need? What can we help you with? What's the problem

25:47.195 --> 25:48.357
set? And I get all kinds of phone calls. Let me just 
give you an example. Genesis, a company out here,

25:53.784 --> 25:57.870
wanted to recruit an Indian scientist from 
Princeton. Really outstanding. The other guy

25:59.613 --> 26:01.856
came out here, and how does he find housing? So I 
linked him with our mortgage company. His wife

26:03.558 --> 26:04.720
needs a job. She's been teaching at some small 
college. Can we help get her a job? I connect her

26:08.605 --> 26:11.229
with a community college, and she gets a job. All 
the way from... Somebody from Houston Bio who's on

26:14.857 --> 26:21.603
the Governor's Science and Technology Committee 
calls and says the Governor's Committee wants to

26:14.857 --> 26:21.603
meet out here. They have a limited budget. Can we 
use the Woodlands Indian Country Club and get a box

26:23.525 --> 26:26.927
lunch? That's facilitation as well. Yeah, I mean, 
a lot of that. We're now negotiating with MD

26:31.892 --> 26:37.337
Anderson for them to move a cancer research center 
out here. There was some real serious

26:37.397 --> 26:43.682
misunderstandings between our real estate 
people. who behave when they're selling real

26:44.472 --> 26:54.488
estate, it doesn't matter whether they're 
talking to a university or an electric company.

26:54.548 --> 27:02.360
And there isn't that real understanding about 
academic research and the long terms and the need

26:54.548 --> 27:02.360
for publications and so forth. And I got involved 
in that and acted as a facilitator on Boonsman and

27:02.380 --> 27:09.612
that's kind of what. In addition to that, George 
has me represent him on a number of educational

27:12.097 --> 27:19.605
projects that he gets involved in. When he served 
on the Governor's Select Committee.

27:27.294 --> 27:35.603
He gets an invitation from Corrigan, who's got 
this new educational enterprise at A&M, and they

27:27.294 --> 27:35.603
invite George to serve on it. And he says, sure, and 
I go, you know he's now on your regents. Yeah,

27:40.509 --> 27:41.330
Mitchell? Yeah. No, when did that happen? I 
thought, somebody told me today. This just

27:46.621 --> 27:47.803
happened then. Yeah. Because he wasn't. Yeah, 
somebody told me. I hope it's a reliable source. Is

27:52.851 --> 27:54.914
that a new appointment by the new governor? I don't 
know if it's by the new governor. I mean, I don't

27:57.699 --> 27:58.720
know. Somebody told me today. You better, you 
check it out. But anyway, he...

28:08.830 --> 28:20.322
He's on the executive committee of the Greater 
Houston Partnership, which is this consortium

28:08.830 --> 28:20.322
of, you know, and the chamber there decided that a 
top priority was educational reform. So they

28:21.744 --> 28:25.888
needed somebody to chair that study that they did. 
So George volunteered, and they asked him, and he

28:26.148 --> 28:31.294
said, okay, he can do it. One of the things 
that's... surfaced repeatedly has been his

28:34.210 --> 28:41.179
effort to get a campus in the woodlands. Do you know 
about that? Oh, boy. I mean, I would think that you

28:43.742 --> 28:45.424
would. Yeah. That's about a 20-year history. And 
about 20 years ago, he and Cynthia Mitchell

28:52.893 --> 29:03.947
offered the University to use the 300 acres in the 
woodlands for the development of a four-year

28:52.893 --> 29:03.947
campus. That's when Phil Hoffman was the 
president.

29:15.149 --> 29:18.494
It was a three-year kind of gift. You must have the 
state approval by three years, and if not, we'll

29:18.514 --> 29:25.004
renegotiate. The closest that we came was when 
Mark White was governor. And, oh, well. Houston

29:35.968 --> 29:38.973
was supported, the university. The university 
was supported. Yeah, I mean, they kept taking the

29:39.995 --> 29:42.339
300 acres. How enthusiastic they were is 
difficult to determine. Initially,

29:49.210 --> 29:59.247
what had happened is when the coordinating board 
approved the Clear Lake campus for the University

29:49.210 --> 29:59.247
of Houston, They also said for the future that U of H 
would have a campus in the south, Clear Lake, and

30:00.037 --> 30:06.006
one in the north. And people understood that to 
mean the woodlands.

30:14.539 --> 30:18.465
And things were going along where that was still on 
the drawing board. Then Phil Hoffman grabbed the

30:19.647 --> 30:26.017
University of Houston downtown as a campus. And 
Ken Ashworth was really upset about that. And

30:30.327 --> 30:34.052
Ashworth kind of took the position, well, there 
goes your campus in the north.

30:37.116 --> 30:49.132
In any event, a proposal was made to the 
coordinating board to get preliminary funding,

30:37.116 --> 30:49.132
authorized preliminary funding, to do the design 
of a campus up here. This was, I've got the whole

30:49.152 --> 30:51.656
chronology.

30:54.559 --> 30:55.761
In fact, I'll loan you this.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.631
I've already been curious about that. This I 
prepared when I was at the University of Houston.

31:06.836 --> 31:07.617
This was in 1982. And here,

31:07.637 --> 31:19.653
well, it's... Or can we borrow it and photocopy it 
and send it back to you? Sure, yeah. The idea here

31:21.015 --> 31:24.480
was, the history's in here, et cetera. But a 
presentation was made to the coordinating board

31:30.740 --> 31:36.129
The day before the presentation was to be made, it 
was clear we had the votes. When the presentation

31:38.393 --> 31:47.869
was being made, a couple of legislators came in 
representing the Huntsville area, where

31:38.393 --> 31:47.869
Huntsville is. And Texas A&U? Not Texas A&U. I mean 
Sam Houston? I mean Sam Houston at Huntsville.

31:55.090 --> 32:03.464
were vehemently opposed to it by saying it would 
stifle the enrollments at Sam Houston, it would be

31:55.090 --> 32:03.464
competitive, it was a mistake, et cetera, et 
cetera. So the Courting Board voted to defer

32:03.484 --> 32:08.853
that. And Ashworth set certain conditions. When 
the enrollment at Sam Houston reaches a certain

32:13.581 --> 32:20.693
level, when the population within 15 miles of here 
reaches a certain size, and only if it's to be an

32:21.247 --> 32:25.812
upper-level college so it won't compete with 
freshman and sophomore. Then we'll reconsider."

32:28.635 --> 32:44.651
So four years later, they went back to the 
coordinating board and showed them that Sam

32:28.635 --> 32:44.651
Houston's enrollment had been lowered by the 
coordinating board itself, and even without any

32:28.635 --> 32:44.651
other competition out here, had never reached the 
goals. The population, in fact, here had exceeded

32:45.252 --> 32:50.157
that 15-mile concentric zone. And the idea was to 
have only a junior or senior anyway. The Courting

32:54.479 --> 32:56.822
Board decided not to take any action. A proposal 
was made in the Appropriations Committee of the

32:57.763 --> 33:08.656
Legislature to provide $250,000 to the 
University of Houston to begin planning a campus

32:57.763 --> 33:08.656
out here. And everything was going along fine. 
Then somebody, and it's the woman who headed up the

33:11.540 --> 33:17.747
Higher Education Committee, What's her name, the 
black woman? Yes.

33:25.963 --> 33:28.092
She said that would jeopardize Prairie View, And 
Mark White vetoed it. Mark White vetoed it. It was

33:31.874 --> 33:36.341
the only piece of the educational legislation 
that he vetoed. So that's that aside. Then after

33:37.763 --> 33:44.072
that... Well, I had heard once that A&M had been 
somewhat opposed to this, and that Bill Moore in

33:37.763 --> 33:44.072
particular. No, what A&M had said on many 
occasions, and a lot of us tended to agree, was that

33:44.132 --> 33:56.110
if he would have given the land to A&M 20 years ago, 
there would be a campus here. And many people

33:56.891 --> 33:58.213
agreed with that. that if they had given it to A&M 
and given A&M's clout and their ability, there

33:58.582 --> 34:06.711
might have been something here. In any event,

34:08.613 --> 34:15.201
the gift... Has that idea ever resurfaced? Yeah. 
Of A&M? One of the things I'd like you to talk about a

34:16.522 --> 34:24.551
little bit is how central that idea is to Mr. 
Mitchell's vision for the Woodlands. It's

34:24.571 --> 34:26.293
absolutely... I would say if you were to ask him,

34:27.134 --> 34:39.347
if you had your one or two choices of what you would 
want here, what would it be, he would say a

34:27.134 --> 34:39.347
world-class university. But a university, an 
advanced study center university, but at least

34:40.448 --> 34:48.377
starting with an upper-level university. I would 
say that that would be a top priority to him. And

34:52.649 --> 34:55.653
he's kicked around the idea of a private 
institution. Some people suggested that. Well, I

34:57.036 --> 34:58.698
was wondering about that, too. Yeah, but we looked 
into that, and it was about $100 million. And then

35:01.142 --> 35:06.189
we heard that some universities were thinking of 
relocating. Trinity had come from somewhere

35:07.090 --> 35:08.853
else. Well, that was a natural thing. And so we 
heard about a few of those, and we went looking into

35:10.636 --> 35:14.722
that. And it was best that those universities just 
close.

35:21.337 --> 35:36.195
I did have discussions with people in A&M as 
recently as three years ago about trying to

35:21.337 --> 35:36.195
identify something at A&M that would be 
appropriate to have here. In any event, then came

35:36.215 --> 35:45.547
the economic decline, and the legislature was 
talking about closing campus. So finally, to

35:45.567 --> 35:50.533
bring it on up to where it is now,

35:51.762 --> 35:53.886
They still have 300 acres. If they don't do 
something, well, it's already too late to do

35:55.308 --> 36:08.673
something, it's getting something of 
legislative approval by 1990, which isn't going

35:55.308 --> 36:08.673
to happen, we're not even going to make a proposal. 
About a year and a half ago, Somebody from the

36:11.759 --> 36:24.459
University of Houston system said to me, if George 
Mitchell will do what the Cinco Ranch people did on

36:11.759 --> 36:24.459
the west side of Houston, I don't know if you know 
about that, they have a west Houston institute,

36:11.759 --> 36:24.459
the University of Houston. Cinco Ranch gave them 
10 acres of land free and put up a 40,000 square foot

36:24.479 --> 36:30.309
building. Gave it to them. If George Mitchell 
gives us 10 acres of land, puts up a two and a half

36:33.093 --> 36:39.403
million dollar building, and locates it not in the 
woodland but someplace that's accessible we'd go

36:39.670 --> 37:04.412
for that and my reaction was you guys have more gall 
yeah because he already invested over five

36:39.670 --> 37:04.412
million dollars in the university and sure as hell 
he said okay and he offered him this 10 acres of land

36:39.670 --> 37:04.412
on i-45 and 242. which made it accessible from 
north, south, east, west, and it's prime land. It

37:09.145 --> 37:10.106
means right on 45. And

37:10.807 --> 37:18.816
one, he's never even gotten a letter of 
acknowledgement. And two, they're still

37:20.558 --> 37:25.484
debating whether it's the system that's supposed 
to act on it or the campus. But I have now met the new

37:25.964 --> 37:31.871
president, Dr. Burnett, Marguerite Burnett. 
She's going to do something. I'm not sure what. But

37:34.835 --> 37:39.982
I have the sense that she was going to do something 
with it. I said to George a couple of years ago, do

37:40.003 --> 37:47.213
you have a problem if I start talking to people at 
A&M about it? And his feeling was about wanting

37:47.233 --> 37:56.026
Houston out here had much more to do with the fact 
that someday he saw this as being annexed by

37:47.233 --> 37:56.026
Houston. Yes, he's always said that. And also that 
there would be a lot of U of H alumni in the area. It

38:03.674 --> 38:13.168
wasn't, so he, that's what he wanted, but he wasn't 
adverse to somebody else coming in and making a

38:03.674 --> 38:13.168
plan. And I did talk to people at A&M, this was about 
three years ago. I don't know, I didn't get the

38:16.773 --> 38:19.196
sense that. Of course there's all new players at 
the now. I mean, I think, you know, Mowgli might, in

38:22.692 --> 38:26.016
fact, react quite differently. It seems to me a 
very logical move, frankly. I've always thought

38:28.378 --> 38:30.921
that they could do a basic division down here. It 
wouldn't disturb anybody. Just take the students

38:32.202 --> 38:34.204
who are going to be there anyway. I had Kockenauer 
up here or down here with people from his

38:34.344 --> 38:41.352
international business program. And I thought 
this could become an excellent center for studies

38:41.372 --> 38:52.564
and conferences and seminars in the whole 
international area, especially with a lot of

38:41.372 --> 38:52.564
biotech, biomed, technology opportunities. So 
that's where that's at. It's still up in the air.

38:59.751 --> 39:00.051
Yeah.

39:03.695 --> 39:06.117
But we're still working on it. We now have 
submitted a proposal to the North Harris

39:06.277 --> 39:15.927
Community College, because they're probably 
going to have an election trying to incorporate

39:06.277 --> 39:15.927
Montgomery County as community college. And we 
have a proposal to them offering, not as a gift, we

39:22.092 --> 39:27.517
proposed 100 acres of land and some support as a 
possible site for their campus. And it would be in

39:27.737 --> 39:30.580
that same place, I-45. What's the thinking? 
That's a different environment, community

39:32.221 --> 39:36.805
college, from what you're talking about earlier. 
We're talking about two different animals.

39:38.026 --> 39:39.328
That's right. That's right. What's the thinking 
behind that? Well, because the community college

39:41.890 --> 39:45.713
they're talking about would be rather unique. It 
would be somewhat of a nontraditional one with a

39:45.734 --> 39:50.698
very strong emphasis on science and technology. 
advanced courses for seniors in high school. And,

39:53.947 --> 40:04.013
in addition to that, I believe, and a lot of people 
tend to agree, that if we had a community college

39:53.947 --> 40:04.013
here doing freshman and sophomore, and the 
enrollments were constantly growing, That's why

40:04.499 --> 40:08.445
I thought it was something like a basic division. 
You can't even just teach basic divisions all over

40:08.505 --> 40:11.209
the country. You wouldn't have to change 
enrollment. Just tell students you have an option

40:13.893 --> 40:17.338
to take a few classes here, and they'd be here. I 
don't remember what I said. I said, you guys now

40:18.120 --> 40:22.927
have a campus in Japan, and you've got a gold mine 
sitting here. Yeah. It would be a logical thing. It

40:25.891 --> 40:27.674
might interfere with anybody's enrollment. 
Well, that's one of Mobley's buttons, is that

40:27.694 --> 40:30.979
international. Now, are you still running a 
women's conference annually or anything? Yeah,

40:35.741 --> 40:39.410
well, that's something that HARC has taken over. 
And they have a Center for Growth Studies, and it's

40:39.991 --> 40:47.609
in there that I think they're working on. I know 
you're running out of time, but could you give us

40:47.629 --> 40:50.436
sort of a... an overview, I guess, of the 
dimensions of the woodlands, a reflection, you

40:51.800 --> 40:59.131
might say, on how it has developed in your mind of 
where it's going. You mentioned, for example, the

40:59.432 --> 41:03.037
perception a lot of people had as a company town. 
That's interesting. The new community thing, you

41:04.459 --> 41:05.842
know. Well, both of those, in my mind, seem 
obviously obsolete. So where has the woodlands

41:09.427 --> 41:15.917
gone from there to here, and where are they going, 
do you think, in terms of what you see?

41:20.555 --> 41:25.963
Is it something totally different than even 
George Mitchell in surmise could happen?

41:30.009 --> 41:38.261
I

41:30.009 --> 41:38.261
don't see a hell of a lot of vision out here without 
George Mitchell, to be very keen. That's a

41:38.882 --> 41:42.207
question we've asked a lot of people. It's my 
expectation, because he is George Mitchell, he

41:44.911 --> 41:49.718
will live to be 190. I've heard that before, too, I 
think. And I don't see any flagging of his energy.

41:59.403 --> 42:01.065
Have you all ever watched him play tennis? No, no, I 
haven't. Take a shot

42:05.710 --> 42:09.635
at that. And that is not, I don't mean to be, that's 
not as a reflection of the quality of the people

42:09.675 --> 42:17.224
here. But they basically are people who've been 
trained and socialized in real estate and energy

42:17.626 --> 42:24.416
and accounting. And while some of them are very, 
very bright and outstanding in their field, there

42:25.618 --> 42:33.009
isn't that creativeness. And the other thing is 
that George can afford to be crazy. Because he can

42:37.917 --> 42:40.500
draw money from here and there and call a dividend. 
And these guys, it's a different level of

42:40.540 --> 42:46.890
accountability.

42:47.123 --> 42:55.374
And fortunately, George is the kind of guy that 
tolerates a handful of nuts to be around kind of

42:47.123 --> 42:55.374
reminding people. Dick Brown, senior vice 
president for planning. Dick is one of those

42:58.838 --> 43:00.561
people. The guys in accounting think he's asking 
you off the screen. Yeah, I sense that. We had a good

43:06.608 --> 43:09.152
interview with him. When things are really tough, 
Brown is talking about this pavilion. creating a

43:14.022 --> 43:17.467
pavilion with this marble slab around it. And 
Roger Goliatis has to sit there as president of the

43:17.828 --> 43:22.134
women's corporation and say, why the hell are 
money coming from this? Meanwhile, the energy

43:23.376 --> 43:30.688
guys, for the most part, have always looked at real 
estate as... Oh yeah, they said so without any

43:23.376 --> 43:30.688
reservations. Yeah, one of those guys said to me, I 
thought you were okay, Gatlin, before you got into

43:30.708 --> 43:36.136
real estate. I mean, no good deed goes unpunished. 
You're one of them. Truly. And, you know, and so

43:42.760 --> 43:45.924
they'll sit there and say, what is it? And a lot of 
them feel that way about Hark. Yeah, yeah, I'm

43:49.228 --> 43:51.090
sure. George keeps pouring money in it. What the 
hell does that do for us? And on top of that, George

43:53.733 --> 43:59.240
is very reluctant sometimes to sell land. And he's 
a land developer. What happens with him

44:02.704 --> 44:11.434
sometimes, we had somebody who was very much 
interested in buying 49% of the woodlands in a

44:02.704 --> 44:11.434
conference center in the country club. at a 
remarkable price. I mean, a naive price.

44:19.198 --> 44:24.303
And when George heard, his reaction was, if 
they're willing to pay that, we could get more. And

44:25.825 --> 44:37.178
then I think part of this whole Greek ethnicity and 
its value system is their real reluctance to give

44:25.825 --> 44:37.178
up the land. It's almost as if I'm I'm here to 
develop this land. Boy, I'm going to make it very

44:42.554 --> 44:47.999
tough for you to take any of it away from me. But he 
does have the energy and the vision and the

44:48.019 --> 44:51.582
stamina. And I think that as long as he's here, this 
place will always be an excellent case study for

44:52.984 --> 45:06.537
the Harvard Business School as to how not to run a 
business. Because the man is. But at the same time,

45:09.380 --> 45:22.356
that spirit that he has, and that energy that he 
has, and that power that he has, forces people to

45:09.380 --> 45:22.356
work on it. Well, there's a lot of dynamics here 
that obviously emanate from George Mitchell. But

45:27.842 --> 45:35.432
I wonder what that impact has become established 
in the community itself. I ask that in some way or

45:35.452 --> 45:38.155
another. Yeah, I think it has. I think it has. We 
took him on a tour last week with a number of the new

45:43.624 --> 45:51.875
research companies out here. He visited eight or 
nine. And, you know, he was just thrilled. I mean,

45:56.021 --> 46:03.591
he's driven by and seen this building and that 
building, Venture Tech 2, 3, and 4. But he really

46:04.352 --> 46:08.057
got in there and saw the labs and met some of the 
scientists and, you know, One of them said, we were

46:09.758 --> 46:12.421
visited by the king and his court. The pope and his 
following, they're here. But that's...

46:20.931 --> 46:23.594
I don't know if that answers the question. We asked 
Michael Richmond and Roger Galatis a question

46:23.614 --> 46:33.826
which, in a way, you've answered, although their 
answers were also constant. We keep hearing the

46:33.846 --> 46:37.690
same thing about certain things, particularly 
about the church. What will happen in European

46:39.087 --> 46:48.117
when Mr. Mitchell passes on to the Woodlands 
Corporation and to the literature itself? He is

46:48.137 --> 46:52.902
the man who said that the creativity of the video 
would. Well, it's very clear to me, at least this is

46:52.922 --> 47:04.335
my perception, that he's not grooming any of his 
kids.

47:07.572 --> 47:10.096
And I don't see him grooming anybody else. My guess 
would be that they'll sell off the energy company,

47:12.721 --> 47:26.104
strange as it sounds, and that Cynthia Mitchell, 
she survives, and then she will.
