00:10.443 --> 00:18.233
Okay, this is Ron Shorn at the Berkeley American 
Astronomical Society meeting, June 10th, 1993,

00:10.443 --> 00:18.233
and I'm talking with Brad Smith. Brad, for the 
record, would you give your full name? Bradford A.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.659
Smith. Okay, when did you get into planetary 
astronomy? 1955.

00:31.972 --> 00:35.016
Okay, and where and doing what? I was in the Army and 
assigned to work with Clyde Tombaugh at Lowell

00:35.587 --> 00:48.662
Observatory in what was then the New Mexico 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.

00:50.044 --> 01:05.442
Tombaugh was conducting a search for 
earth-orbiting

00:50.044 --> 01:05.442
satellites, small earth-orbiting satellites, 
and the Army Map Service, specifically John

00:50.044 --> 01:05.442
O'Keefe, sent me to to the southwest to work with 
Tombaugh.

01:11.246 --> 01:27.567
When you first broke into the racket, were you 
aware of any bias against the planetary solar

01:11.246 --> 01:27.567
system work on the part of real astronomers, say, 
for example, people that work on galaxies or stars

01:11.246 --> 01:27.567
and mammals and various other places? Hey, I 
started off with Tombaugh. I was thrown into the

01:29.289 --> 01:32.593
bias issue right at the very beginning. and had 
other contacts with Kuiper. So I was very familiar

01:36.779 --> 01:43.708
with the bias against so-called planetary 
astronomy. Do you think any of that had to do with

01:43.728 --> 01:56.204
the fact that there was kind of an instrumental 
barrier, namely infrared detectors were junk and

01:43.728 --> 01:56.204
that's where the spectral information was, 
photometry was pretty poor to get any information

01:43.728 --> 01:56.204
out of that? Or was it personal, or was it Percival 
Lowell, or was it a combination? I think people

02:00.704 --> 02:11.470
like Lowell probably had some effect on this 
attitude, but the attitude seemed to be a fairly

02:00.704 --> 02:11.470
general one. That is, people who study the planets 
just aren't doing serious astronomy. tendencies

02:19.148 --> 02:32.542
continue today, many astronomers feel that if 
you're not doing cosmological extragalactic

02:19.148 --> 02:32.542
astronomy and just playing around our own galaxy, 
you're not doing serious astronomy. So these

02:32.582 --> 02:38.428
things just come about depending upon what's in 
vogue at the time. Do you think planetary

02:39.269 --> 02:42.132
astronomy is astronomy? Of course it's 
astronomy. Do you think the general public thinks

02:43.634 --> 02:46.817
planetary astronomy is astronomy? Very 
definitely. When did you first cross paths with

02:48.933 --> 02:52.639
NSA? With NASA? When they were created. In what 
way? Tombo and I both had proposals and we were

03:00.630 --> 03:15.733
funded very early on among, I guess, among the very 
first NASA grants that were provided by the

03:00.630 --> 03:15.733
fledgling NASA. Do you remember what that was for? 
Yeah, I can remember what some of them were for. We

03:24.877 --> 03:44.999
had, both Tombaugh and I, had come to the 
conclusion, I'm sure others as well, that the

03:24.877 --> 03:44.999
planetary work that was being done at Lowell and 
Lick and various other places, they tended to

03:24.877 --> 03:44.999
concentrate on taking observations, 
photographs, when everything was just right. You

03:45.139 --> 03:49.163
know, a close Mars opposition, when Jupiter was in 
opposition. And I wanted to get involved in

03:49.143 --> 04:01.659
synoptic observations, to look at the planets 
every night, whether it was good seeing or bad

03:49.143 --> 04:01.659
seeing, whether it was close to opposition or far. 
And so we put in a proposal to do this using a

04:03.041 --> 04:11.432
telescope that was left over from Tombaugh's 
satellite search program. That was the basis of

04:12.213 --> 04:16.078
the original support from NASA. Where do you think 
planetary astronomy would be today without the

04:17.189 --> 04:23.695
money that NASA has spent on it in the last 30 years? 
Well, that's a little hard to judge. I mean, after

04:27.038 --> 04:45.576
all, if NASA were to stop their support right now, 
there would be a real hiatus in ground-based

04:27.038 --> 04:45.576
planetary astronomy because the NSF doesn't have 
a recent history of supporting planetary

04:27.038 --> 04:45.576
astronomy. I really don't know. Planets became 
more important as the technology developed to

04:48.281 --> 04:56.069
study them. And if there had been no NASA, I would 
guess that at some level, the NSF would have

04:56.229 --> 05:04.919
provided support for studies of planets. But 
without question, it was boosted by NASA's need to

05:04.959 --> 05:15.090
have ground-based support for their flight 
programs. In general, how's your relationship

05:15.458 --> 05:18.201
been with NSA? In other words, do you have any 
complements, any gripes? No, I've had a very good

05:23.306 --> 05:25.588
relationship with NASA. Money is always short, 
and there's always a fight for funds. And that gets

05:31.073 --> 05:39.001
the problems becoming exacerbated when the 
funding really drops down as it is right now. But I

05:39.822 --> 05:44.166
certainly don't have any long-term complaints 
now. Do you think planetary astronomers have done

05:44.973 --> 05:50.321
a good job of selling themselves to the public and 
to Congress? I think they've done an especially

05:51.162 --> 05:53.225
good job. I know many people in the astrophysics 
area who sort of look at solar system astronomers

05:54.267 --> 06:08.228
as a model for what they should be doing in trying to 
promote programs and get support. It's been 30

06:10.371 --> 06:13.596
years now of modern planetary astronomy. or more, 
and both from the ground and from space probes and

06:13.930 --> 06:27.827
from landings and everything, we haven't found a 
single trace of present or past life anywhere in

06:13.930 --> 06:27.827
the solar system except Earth, and in particular 
no little green man on Mars. Do you think that's had

06:29.009 --> 06:34.656
a negative effect on public support and financial 
support for planetary travel? I think the public

06:36.509 --> 06:41.139
fairly quickly forgets the negative results. 
Certainly in the post-Viking era, I'm sure there

06:42.201 --> 06:53.264
was a lot of public disappointment over Viking's 
failure to find

06:42.201 --> 06:53.264
life on Mars. On the other hand, I believe, as do 
many, that the experiments designed for carrying

06:55.544 --> 07:02.354
out a search for life on Mars were not optimized. 
And at some point, we're going to go out and do it

07:02.775 --> 07:08.002
again and hopefully do it right next time. And I 
think when this program becomes common

07:09.625 --> 07:20.961
knowledge, that once again, you'll see the public 
lining up with great interest to see what comes out

07:09.625 --> 07:20.961
of it. Thirty years ago, if this would be an 
American Astronomical Society, meaning

07:21.717 --> 07:26.305
everybody would be here. Since then, the 
planetary astronomers, among others, have had

07:26.465 --> 07:33.979
their own sub-society, the Division for 
Planetary Sciences. American planetary

07:34.820 --> 07:38.066
astronomers have their own journal now, Icarus. 
Have these developments been good or bad for

07:39.288 --> 07:46.020
planetary astronomy and astronomy in general? I 
think it's been good for both. One sees the

07:49.348 --> 08:00.940
occasional planetary astronomer or planetary 
scientist at the full-up AAS meetings and an

07:49.348 --> 08:00.940
occasional paper sometimes because it's just the 
right time to present it. But getting planetary

08:01.881 --> 08:15.977
astronomers together and getting their own 
publication, I think, has been beneficial both to

08:01.881 --> 08:15.977
the group as a whole and to astronomy in general. 
Where are you now? Where am I now besides sitting

08:17.962 --> 08:21.567
here talking to you? You mean my institutional 
affiliation? Yes, I'm with the Institute for

08:23.730 --> 08:28.756
Astronomy, University of Hawaii. How long have 
you been there? I've been there almost three years

08:30.498 --> 08:33.763
now. Where were you before that? Before that, I was 
at the University of Arizona. I was there for 15

08:38.448 --> 08:40.490
years. From when to when? From 1973, 74, I can't 
remember exactly, until 1990. Okay, and what part

08:48.257 --> 08:51.220
of the University of Arizona? Oh, in the planetary 
sciences department. I also had a joint

08:54.043 --> 08:58.827
appointment within the astronomy department. 
One place that you're associated with, in my mind,

08:59.328 --> 09:03.612
is New Mexico State University. And when did you 
get associated with that? Well, my association

09:07.709 --> 09:15.421
began, actually, when I went to work with Tombaugh 
in 1955. When I got out of the Army in 1957, I elected

09:15.901 --> 09:26.217
to stay on in Massachusetts and spent some time 
working with Tombaugh. At that time, we were

09:26.437 --> 09:29.883
supported by Air Force funds, and they were fairly 
meager. So I spent a little time working with the

09:30.624 --> 09:36.653
rocket facility at the Physical Sciences 
Laboratory. But then shortly after that, NASA

09:37.392 --> 09:47.521
came into existence, funding became available, 
and I went back to doing astronomy again with

09:37.392 --> 09:47.521
Tombaugh. Now, you folks built that up quite a bit. 
How long were you at New Mexico State, and when did

09:49.944 --> 09:52.526
you leave there? I was there for about 17, 18 years 
from, well, as soon as I got out of the Army, 57,

09:53.707 --> 10:04.497
until... So you can do the lift and kick workout, 
right? Yeah, until 1973 or thereabouts. And you

10:12.367 --> 10:15.372
actually built that up to a fairly good-sized 
department, didn't you? We did, yeah. What's

10:17.415 --> 10:18.476
happened to it since? It's still going. There's 
still a fairly strong planetary commitment

10:19.899 --> 10:24.125
there. Rita Beebe pretty much took over for me when 
I left, and as the planetary patrol that we

10:25.247 --> 10:32.998
initiated, back in the mid to late 50s is still 
going and still being supported.

10:42.044 --> 10:45.248
I should have asked you at the beginning, when were 
you born and where? I was born in 1931 in Cambridge,

10:45.268 --> 10:55.699
Massachusetts.

10:55.719 --> 11:00.825
What do you think is the most important piece of 
work in planetary astronomy that you've done? I

11:02.662 --> 11:08.227
mean, either research or going to the department 
or preventing a fight or whatever. Well, you know,

11:08.568 --> 11:10.329
it's been a lot of things. I've been in this for a 
long time, really getting old now. I mean, for

11:14.393 --> 11:25.784
example, the planetary patrol that we initiated 
almost immediately began to produce results just

11:14.393 --> 11:25.784
because of the synoptic studies. We essentially 
co-discovered the... the four-day rotation of

11:30.590 --> 11:36.218
the high atmosphere winds on Venus. We discovered 
the vortical nature, the rotation of the Great Red

11:37.680 --> 11:49.937
Spot long before it was observed by Pioneer 10.

11:53.142 --> 11:59.230
We

11:53.142 --> 11:59.230
did work on the clouds of Mars and the formation of 
high clouds over the volcanoes. All that was done

12:05.943 --> 12:18.965
from the ground, but since that time I've been 
involved with Mariner 6 and 7, Mariner 9, and

12:05.943 --> 12:18.965
Viking, and finally Voyager. As far as scientific 
accomplishment is concerned, Probably Voyager

12:22.075 --> 12:24.439
just really has to be it. The enormous amount of 
knowledge that came out of that program, the

12:24.459 --> 12:32.753
success of that program, has certainly been a 
highlight in my career. Do you think NASA gives

12:33.694 --> 12:42.008
enough money for long-term data analysis after a 
mission is over and the pretty pictures have

12:33.694 --> 12:42.008
appeared in time? No, that's always been a 
problem. It continues as a problem today. I think

12:45.874 --> 12:53.426
that there are people at NASA who understand this 
problem and are trying desperately to keep the

12:45.874 --> 12:53.426
funding going. And there is an announcement right 
now, for example, for Neptune's Voyager Neptune

12:54.327 --> 13:00.537
science It's

13:01.225 --> 13:07.674
just one of the first things to go when budget cuts 
come in. You've already gotten the data, and if you

13:07.754 --> 13:13.381
don't analyze it this year, well, theoretically, 
you can do it next year or the year after. One would

13:15.124 --> 13:20.271
hope that that situation, which is already 
improving, will continue to improve. What's the

13:21.092 --> 13:23.054
state of planetary astronomy today?

13:27.620 --> 13:30.304
Planetary astronomy as such is... not in very good 
shape. And it's really a result of the success of

13:32.790 --> 13:37.235
the space program. Missions like Mariner, 
Viking, Voyager have learned so much about the

13:38.757 --> 13:55.397
planets that it's difficult to improve on that or 
to add incrementally to ground-based

13:38.757 --> 13:55.397
observations. Surely there's a lot of work that 
can be done with small bodies, comets, asteroids.

14:02.245 --> 14:09.673
These new objects that are being observed out in 
the so-called Kuiper belt are extremely

14:02.245 --> 14:09.673
interesting. And there are still good things that 
can be done from the ground. The monitoring of the

14:13.959 --> 14:18.324
volcanic activity on HEO is an example of that. But 
it's not in the same place that it was back during

14:23.221 --> 14:39.082
the 60s when almost everything you could do with 
new instrumentation was new and discoveries were

14:23.221 --> 14:39.082
being made one right after the other.

14:40.745 --> 14:42.968
Could you give me a little summary of your 
schooling? Yeah, I have a bachelor's degree in

14:44.169 --> 14:49.937
chemical engineering. I got Northeastern 
University in 1954.

14:57.029 --> 15:07.407
I then went into the Army from there to New Mexico 
State and probably set a record for the length of

14:57.029 --> 15:07.407
time anyone has ever spent obtaining a PhD. I 
started taking courses in physics very early on in

15:07.467 --> 15:15.300
the late 50s. And then got much more serious about 
it when the astronomy department was created in

15:16.057 --> 15:22.132
Mexico State. Finally wrote my dissertation and 
got my PhD in 1972. Do you think you talk to... Other

15:31.632 --> 15:36.900
types of astronomers more than you did say 20 years 
ago or about the same or less? A lot more. A lot more.

15:39.684 --> 15:44.051
In fact, I'm really not doing very much in the way of 
planetary work right now. I've gotten involved in

15:44.071 --> 15:45.593
some other things. But yeah, I think my interest 
has broadened considerably since I started. You

15:51.702 --> 15:57.030
mentioned that there's still some looking down on 
planetary work. Is there... Less of that than

15:58.295 --> 16:01.999
there was 20 or 30 years ago or about the same? Very, 
very much less.

16:06.023 --> 16:12.729
I served for quite a number of years on the 
Telescope Allocation Committee at the

16:06.023 --> 16:12.729
University of Arizona. And everybody who has been 
to Arizona is familiar with the arguments and the

16:12.970 --> 16:22.459
fights that went on between Kuiper and Bach. I 
mean, it's legendary. And the way the two sides of

16:23.900 --> 16:26.563
the street looked at one another. But during the 
time I spent on the TAC, I found that the so-called

16:27.269 --> 16:36.840
astrophysical people, stellar galactic type but 
very often speak up and support a proposal to do

16:37.107 --> 16:44.536
planetary work just as much as the planetary 
representatives. I think a lot of that has gone

16:44.596 --> 16:46.198
away. These things still exist. You know, I 
mentioned the cosmologists and the people who

16:48.300 --> 17:00.735
really look out to Hi-Z, kind of looking down on 
people who still poke around with globular

16:48.300 --> 17:00.735
clusters in their own galaxy and so on. I think 
these things will always exist. There's some

17:02.877 --> 17:06.962
pecking order that gets established somewhere.

17:09.355 --> 17:14.264
What has the American taxpayer got out of 
planetary astronomy for the money they put in it?

17:14.544 --> 17:14.985
Knowledge. Do you think it's really had an effect? 
An effect on what? On the way people think about the

17:21.616 --> 17:25.243
universe or themselves or anything? Absolutely 
had an effect on the way people think about the

17:25.363 --> 17:32.275
universe, without question.

17:32.980 --> 17:36.145
I see that in talking to people on airplanes. I 
mean, people really are a lot more savvy than a lot

17:36.165 --> 17:42.434
of the scientists give them credit for, just 
because. And I think NASA deserves an enormous

17:43.136 --> 17:58.359
amount of credit for this, getting information 
out and making it available to the public and

17:43.136 --> 17:58.359
stimulating the production of various 
television series that have gotten the same

17:43.136 --> 17:58.359
information out to the public. It could be a lot 
better, by the way. NASA could... could still

18:01.465 --> 18:07.791
improve its relationship with the education 
system in this country. But I think what they've

18:07.811 --> 18:12.956
accomplished so far has been very effective. On a 
personal note, when you meet somebody on an

18:12.976 --> 18:19.483
airplane sitting next to them or something, you 
tell them you're an astronomer, what's the

18:12.976 --> 18:19.483
reaction you tend to get? Oh, sort of awe. Awe that 
they are actually sitting right next to an

18:23.767 --> 18:27.591
astronomer. Do I spend all my time up on Mauna Kea? A 
few people realize that astronomers spend less

18:31.542 --> 18:42.176
than 10% of their time collecting data and the 
other 90% trying to understand what it was that

18:31.542 --> 18:42.176
they got. But, yeah, it's, wow, you're an 
astronomer. Wow, what's new in the universe? So

18:49.405 --> 18:50.987
it's favorable. Oh, yeah, very, definitely.
