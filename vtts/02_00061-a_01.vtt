00:02.140 --> 00:17.928
31st sitting in Suzanne Dethridge office about to interview her about her student experiences particularly in her work as a student reporter Suzanne check your mic out.

00:19.130 --> 00:24.840
This is Suzanne L. Dethridge D. E. A. T. H. E. R. A. G. E.

00:32.245 --> 00:45.816
Suzanne, for someone who might not know you, reading the transcript of this tape in years to come, summarize your growing up and your background before you arrived at A&M.

00:46.724 --> 00:48.768
Well, I grew up in Houston, Texas.

00:50.532 --> 00:59.250
My parents are native Texans and did not have a history though of any Aggies in the family.

00:59.290 --> 01:02.978
One uncle who attended briefly

01:03.397 --> 01:10.413
but no prior graduates and I graduated from Sharpstown High School in 1974.

01:10.734 --> 01:19.093
I was one of 735 in my graduating class and

01:19.073 --> 01:30.269
looked at the Texas universities, but didn't really have a prior inclination or strong feeling about going to A&M.

01:30.289 --> 01:46.171
I chose it because of its strong program, its academics and being close to home and, as I told my parents, safer to go to school and live off campus at A&M than to live on campus at UT.

01:46.191 --> 01:47.713
I was accepted at both.

01:47.693 --> 01:51.818
There were dorm rooms available at UT, but not at Texas A&M.

01:52.339 --> 01:59.849
So I did go through the lottery process, but ended up living in an apartment complex.

01:59.869 --> 02:08.580
I'm the oldest of six children, and a couple of the others did come in and get a bit of the Aggie experience, but I'm the only graduate.

02:09.762 --> 02:12.385
Did you come to visit the campus before you enrolled?

02:12.500 --> 02:12.901
I did.

02:12.921 --> 02:23.521
I came with some of my fellow high school students who had older siblings attending Texas A&M and visited and toured the campus.

02:24.243 --> 02:25.565
What was it that attracted you?

02:25.605 --> 02:28.551
What were the factors that seemed positive to you?

02:30.556 --> 02:46.701
much of what I heard about A&M, you know, given that I had, I'm the oldest of my family, so of the six, and so I didn't have that reference with siblings, but my friends did, and so they spoke highly of the university.

02:47.662 --> 02:57.998
And I was active in high school in my yearbook and high school journalism class, and had had the opportunity to

02:57.978 --> 03:05.530
and interview at the Houston Post and the Houston Chronicle, and they both spoke highly of Texas A&M.

03:05.570 --> 03:09.837
Even though we had a small journalism program here, that was my interest.

03:10.238 --> 03:16.188
And so I had been favorably impressed, you know, by the professional opinions that were held of the Texas A&M program.

03:17.330 --> 03:20.695
Did you go through fish camp?

03:20.995 --> 03:22.077
No, I did not.

03:22.658 --> 03:24.722
And I really didn't have a strong awareness.

03:25.264 --> 03:42.919
So the exposure that I had was coming to apply, going with a friend who interviewed with the dean of women at the time to find out about housing.

03:42.899 --> 03:50.372
I could tell she received more attention being related to Aggie students and Aggie graduates.

03:50.392 --> 03:59.187
You could tell that there was that network amongst the A&M family.

03:59.167 --> 04:14.789
And so I was a newcomer in that sense, but I tagged along, and so I overheard much of what was explained, but I probably was missed as far as the opportunity of Fish Camp.

04:15.250 --> 04:20.938
Describe that first fall, what it must have been like to a newcomer living off campus.

04:21.678 --> 04:30.574
Well, you know, there's that culture shock and switching from a protected home environment and being out there on your own.

04:30.942 --> 04:52.866
I think that the real estate community knew how to exploit that because I did go through an apartment locator service and they took me first to see a very rundown old dilapidated apartment and then took me to the newest

04:52.846 --> 05:05.540
you know, most expensive complex and that's where I ended up staying and having an apartment two-bedroom with two other roommates, the three of us sharing.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.982
What was the cost of that?

05:07.162 --> 05:07.642
Do you remember?

05:08.283 --> 05:09.484
No, I don't remember.

05:09.505 --> 05:11.126
I don't remember.

05:11.206 --> 05:11.947
You say it was new?

05:12.588 --> 05:13.229
It was new.

05:13.289 --> 05:13.449
Where?

05:13.469 --> 05:16.272
It was the Briarwood Apartments on Highway 30.

05:16.589 --> 05:25.097
And at that time, I believe it was the Tanglewood Apartments that were the last, that was the outer

05:25.398 --> 05:34.827
edge of city and development on Highway 30 and then you went what seemed to me a long distance before you hit Briarwood again.

05:34.927 --> 05:41.314
So it seemed rather remote to me, that particular apartment complex.

05:41.334 --> 05:54.747
But it was nice and they did have the shuttle bus service and I did use the shuttle bus service to get to and from and eventually did end up with my own car.

05:55.148 --> 05:57.572
But it was a time of shortages.

05:57.612 --> 06:07.469
You know, there was a shortage of on-campus housing, there was a shortage of parking, and the shuttle bus service was crowded and overstressed, and it's grown, of course.

06:07.629 --> 06:12.938
And so really it was, you know, being a little fish in a big pond.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.463
What did you bring physically?

06:15.563 --> 06:19.890
What was the stuff that you brought up here?

06:20.225 --> 06:26.252
Well, I rented a furnished apartment, so I brought myself and my wardrobe, and that was about it.

06:26.272 --> 06:27.954
No electronic gear.

06:28.915 --> 06:32.599
No, I didn't have any of, you know, I just... No computer.

06:32.619 --> 06:36.504
Didn't have any of my personal... No microwave, no refrigerator.

06:37.585 --> 06:40.949
So it could be brought in one vehicle?

06:41.550 --> 06:43.852
Yes, and I was eager to come.

06:44.253 --> 06:46.215
I...

06:47.832 --> 06:55.022
came up one evening after my last day of work at my job in Houston.

06:55.263 --> 07:00.010
I'd had an after-school weekend job there, and I had continued to work there through the summer.

07:01.572 --> 07:07.781
And when it was time to report to school in the fall at Texas A&M, I didn't want to wait until the next day.

07:07.821 --> 07:11.867
And I came that night, so it was after dark, and I was nervous.

07:11.907 --> 07:13.890
I had my car loaded with my things.

07:13.870 --> 07:22.796
and had not come by that route very often, so it was a little bit unfamiliar, and so I had that nervousness, but I couldn't wait.

07:22.896 --> 07:25.323
I had to leave that night.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.229
So you came up on your own.

07:27.289 --> 07:28.352
Your parents didn't...

07:28.400 --> 07:30.362
My parents never accompanied me.

07:30.543 --> 07:31.564
They didn't bring it, okay.

07:31.584 --> 07:38.131
No, they didn't accompany me for looking at the campus or for finding an apartment.

07:38.892 --> 07:43.378
I did all that on my own and then I drove myself and moved in at the time.

07:43.418 --> 07:50.606
And I was used to being pretty independent given their obligations with the rest of my big family.

07:51.107 --> 07:57.394
And then subsequently I helped my younger brothers and sisters when they would come to look at campus and consider college.

07:57.627 --> 08:07.502
Describe your first impressions of going to class and what courses you were taking and your impression of the faculty and so forth.

08:08.985 --> 08:10.287
Well, I was bewildered.

08:10.848 --> 08:23.888
You know, I had to find my way around and so it was just a lot of effort at asking questions and getting directions and having some

08:23.868 --> 08:31.297
just basic interviews with the guidance counselors on registering for class.

08:32.038 --> 08:43.352
And beyond the registration process, I was not want to bring much attention to myself, you know, I just managed to find my way and go to class.

08:43.372 --> 08:44.734
They were big classes.

08:44.794 --> 08:47.597
They're all, of course, the freshman introductory

08:47.577 --> 09:04.100
level classes I had placed out of a couple of hours, but there were usually 100 plus students at the time, which is probably small by today's comparisons, but straight out of high school those seemed like big classes to me.

09:04.921 --> 09:08.826
And buying books and going to the MSC, just very typical.

09:09.076 --> 09:11.520
Did you think that the student body was pleasant?

09:12.641 --> 09:13.803
Oh, very much so.

09:13.823 --> 09:14.164
Helpful?

09:14.544 --> 09:14.865
Yes.

09:15.285 --> 09:21.975
Now, did we register still in 74 in the field house, stand in line, or did you do it on a machine?

09:22.276 --> 09:22.837
I've forgotten.

09:23.137 --> 09:24.439
No, it was stand in line.

09:24.499 --> 09:24.820
Okay.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.140
Yes.

09:25.641 --> 09:28.686
And the DeWare field house, over by G. Raleigh White.

09:28.706 --> 09:29.307
That's right.

09:30.268 --> 09:34.915
And do you remember what your, in terms of hour load, what was it that first semester?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.074
I'd have to look that up.

09:37.134 --> 09:44.906
I may still have my report cards, but I took a, I don't think I ever took less than 15 hours, you know, starting out.

09:45.507 --> 09:50.214
See, today's norm is 12, or many students think that 12 is a full-time load.

09:50.295 --> 09:53.319
No, I took, I believe it was at least 15.

09:54.942 --> 09:59.729
And how long did you assume it was going to take you to finish your undergraduate degree?

10:00.731 --> 10:01.392
How many years?

10:01.979 --> 10:06.465
Well, I started out thinking four, but it did take me four and a half.

10:06.485 --> 10:19.942
I graduated in December of 1978, and there was one semester when I withdrew at the time because of the work pressures that I had as a reporter at KVTX-TV.

10:20.643 --> 10:24.308
Now, did you, you already thought you knew what your major would be?

10:24.406 --> 10:26.789
I selected journalism and stayed with it.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.230
I never changed majors.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.311
I was never undeclared.

10:29.331 --> 10:32.375
So journalism was your first semester.

10:32.795 --> 10:33.195
Right.

10:33.296 --> 10:33.876
That was your goal.

10:34.076 --> 10:34.337
Yes.

10:34.537 --> 10:35.017
That was your goal.

10:35.378 --> 10:42.065
All right, as you look back, were there some key faculty members and advisors that you met early in your career at A&M?

10:44.127 --> 10:54.278
Well, the ones that, you know, that I remain fond of in my recollection, there were two, Mr. Bill Harrison in the journalism department.

10:54.697 --> 10:59.825
And I was involved in his classes my sophomore year.

11:00.806 --> 11:06.675
And likewise, Mr. Bob Rogers, who was head of the department at the time.

11:08.498 --> 11:12.644
And so my freshman year, I didn't have as much interaction with the department.

11:12.925 --> 11:17.852
I was taking those basic prerequisite courses.

11:17.832 --> 11:22.838
So it was really not until my second year that I started interacting more with the faculty.

11:22.998 --> 11:35.013
I did join the yearbook, the Aggieland yearbook staff, and served for one year, and that just happened to be the year of the centennial edition.

11:35.033 --> 11:42.842
1976 edition was the centennial year for Texas A&M, actually.

11:42.862 --> 11:46.607
It was not the centennial edition as far as the 100th book.

11:46.587 --> 11:54.256
But it was the 100th year of A&M, and so that was a special edition to work on, and I enjoyed that very much.

11:54.316 --> 11:56.759
And that was all in the Reed McDonald building.

11:57.019 --> 12:09.213
And I had, when you mentioned that I was a student reporter, in that capacity I worked as a part of my semester requirement on the battalion.

12:09.794 --> 12:15.801
But in fact, I was never an official, you know, paid student reporter at the battalion.

12:15.781 --> 12:20.714
Most of my student work was with Aggieland.

12:21.477 --> 12:30.060
All right, now for the sake of anyone who may read this, I want to note that the yearbook originally here was named the Oleo.

12:31.357 --> 12:35.822
And then was the Longhorn for many until 1948.

12:36.243 --> 12:38.045
And then it became the Aggieland.

12:39.086 --> 12:54.604
And I've often wondered, and I've never checked, does the name of the Texas A&M yearbook Longhorn predate the mascot name of athletic teams at the fine university 100 miles west of us?

12:54.664 --> 12:56.707
I wonder which was first.

12:56.907 --> 13:00.351
But I found many current Aggies that cannot believe

13:00.331 --> 13:02.776
that the Longhorn was the name of the yearbook here.

13:03.217 --> 13:08.607
And I'd love to know where they got the name Oleo, how and why.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.932
Well, I'll have to pull out my edition for you.

13:10.952 --> 13:14.559
I wonder if they might have been more comprehensive in the 76th book.

13:14.579 --> 13:15.241
They might have.

13:15.381 --> 13:16.002
Of the history.

13:16.022 --> 13:20.972
Although I do know that when the 100th issue of the yearbook came out, they had a

13:20.952 --> 13:24.179
a separate celebration at the journalism department.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.526
And so you might find some of that information interesting.

13:27.927 --> 13:33.920
Of what value to a journalist was that year or that time on the yearbook staff?

13:34.561 --> 13:36.345
What good was it for a journalist?

13:36.443 --> 14:01.202
Well, actually, you know, there was a lot of experience in layout and design, but I did not do extensive writing, journalistically speaking, because I ended up being the advertising manager, which I was a little disappointed in because I had done that in high school, but then I had moved on to other positions in high school and been more experienced.

14:01.182 --> 14:17.199
But it so happened that for that year in the yearbook, they expected a lot heavier sales in advertising, and I was the only one who had prior advertising experience, so I got tapped for that.

14:17.799 --> 14:28.911
I didn't realize how lucrative that was, and if I had been a more aggressive salesperson, you know, to sell to former students and their companies for the centennial year,

14:28.891 --> 14:32.715
I would have probably made a lot more money as it was.

14:32.775 --> 14:39.623
I got a 15 percent commission, which is probably one of the highest paying rates, you know, for a student job of any kind.

14:39.803 --> 14:48.273
But it was a busy job because the university did not recognize the sororities and fraternities at the time.

14:49.174 --> 14:52.478
So they could not be included in the student organization section.

14:53.179 --> 14:56.923
The only way they could be represented in the yearbook was to buy an ad.

14:56.903 --> 15:10.625
So I was very busy with the photographer taking group photos of all the sororities and the fraternities and doing the layout of their ads in the yearbook.

15:10.725 --> 15:15.933
And that's how they managed to be represented in the yearbook at all.

15:16.975 --> 15:19.279
So it was an interesting behind the scenes.

15:19.299 --> 15:24.447
What was their attitude about that, the fraternity and sorority members, about not being recognized?

15:24.815 --> 15:29.965
Well, you know, they didn't care for that.

15:30.215 --> 15:35.341
were lobbying at the time about their service orientation.

15:35.401 --> 15:49.416
There was the sense that being an Aggie is a fraternity in and of itself, and that it would be divisive to have these other sororities and fraternities, the Greeks.

15:50.197 --> 16:00.188
So they had a lot of that to overcome, but they were very persistent and eventually did, and I think emphasized their strong service orientation.

16:00.674 --> 16:23.130
For the sake of future historians who might read this material, I would like to mention that today we have a higher per capita membership of fraternities among males at A&M than does the University of Texas at Austin, 6% to 5%, and among women, much higher, 14% to 6%.

16:24.252 --> 16:28.318
So we have more fraternity and sorority members per capita than does UT.

16:28.670 --> 16:33.897
And we have more fraternity and sorority members total than we do members of the Corps of Cadets.

16:34.598 --> 16:38.424
Many old-time Aggies are stunned when I mention that to them.

16:38.704 --> 16:46.355
Back to that first year in courses and so forth, how were young women treated on the campus then?

16:46.595 --> 16:50.661
How were co-eds treated by rank-and-file faculty and students?

16:51.535 --> 16:58.869
Well, certainly no differently than I had ever experienced in a large city, in a large high school.

16:59.771 --> 17:03.298
I didn't perceive any difference in treatment.

17:03.919 --> 17:10.793
I wasn't looking for it, but when I would tell people that I was going to Texas A&M,

17:10.773 --> 17:15.018
I had a couple say, oh, you're going for your MRS. I didn't know what that meant.

17:15.038 --> 17:16.961
It just went right over my head.

17:17.001 --> 17:21.987
And then I did figure it out, you know, after I got to Texas A&M.

17:22.007 --> 17:37.287
But my incoming freshman class was reputed to be, and I'd have to double check, was reputed to be, if I recall correctly, the first in which there was a 50-50 ratio of young men to women.

17:37.857 --> 17:52.942
Now, it became more obvious to me in the upper graduate classes, upperclassmen, that there was a disproportionate number of men to women.

17:53.102 --> 18:00.034
But it was not a strong perception that I had being ensconced in my freshman classes.

18:00.622 --> 18:11.716
So that you didn't have to put up with any snide comments about being a female student here from male Aggies walking along the street or anything?

18:11.976 --> 18:15.140
No, I don't have any recollection of that at all.

18:15.380 --> 18:24.672
What was the term, as far as you know, in print to refer to a female student at this institution in those days?

18:25.225 --> 18:28.028
Well, now in print, I don't know that I saw it, but you know.

18:28.068 --> 18:30.491
But for a little while they had been Maggie's.

18:30.571 --> 18:36.338
Well, I was going to say, unofficially, you know, and conversationally, there was no reference of Maggie.

18:37.119 --> 18:41.484
How did you and your fellow coeds feel about that, that term?

18:43.126 --> 18:49.113
It was not offensive, but we didn't want to be different.

18:49.453 --> 18:52.937
You know, we didn't see the need for a distinction.

18:53.693 --> 18:57.528
Did you go to midnight yell practices and football games?

18:57.629 --> 18:59.034
Yes, I sure did.

18:59.536 --> 19:00.199
Describe those.

19:00.219 --> 19:03.552
Well, that was...

19:04.544 --> 19:07.110
You know, a thrilling experience.

19:07.190 --> 19:16.130
It was very rousing and to go to Midnight Yale and march through with the crowds and to attend the games and the march in.

19:16.170 --> 19:24.088
And my early dates at that time were with a member of the Corps, so it was a fuller flavor, you know, of the experience.

19:24.068 --> 19:29.338
The one thing I did not do my first year was attend muster my freshman year.

19:30.000 --> 19:43.326
I did not attend my first muster until my sophomore year, and at that time I was also assigned to cover it as a reporter at Channel 3.

19:43.981 --> 19:46.023
It would have helped if I'd been to one.

19:46.383 --> 19:53.249
I would have known the routine because I was more intrusive than I needed to be as a reporter.

19:53.329 --> 19:56.832
I went out on the floor of G. Riley White to get some film footage.

19:56.872 --> 20:01.677
We didn't have a zoom lens on the camera, the old camera they gave me.

20:02.137 --> 20:08.182
So I had to be actually within a short distance to get the action shot.

20:08.303 --> 20:13.347
And I didn't know that they played taps from these different directions.

20:13.327 --> 20:18.455
And when they started playing, I thought, well, do I stand still and wait, or do I leave the floor?

20:19.557 --> 20:24.244
And I thought, well, if I leave the floor, I'll have to just run right back out, and taps is so short.

20:24.925 --> 20:34.560
So I stayed and tried to be very reverently still, but then it continued to play from these different directions, and I realized that I should have exited.

20:34.700 --> 20:38.225
So I ended up being on the front page of the battalion the next day.

20:38.245 --> 20:41.410
I think they felt like I made myself part of the...

20:41.390 --> 20:49.800
of the story by sharing floor space with the Ross volunteers during that muster.

20:50.301 --> 20:54.266
What was your impression of muster as a total experience, that first one?

20:54.346 --> 20:55.728
What did you think about that event?

20:55.928 --> 21:08.984
Well, the first one, because I was doing it as a job, I was really preoccupied with the logistics of getting the angles of the shots, and I didn't really experience it personally.

21:09.004 --> 21:11.127
And, of course, since then I've been.

21:11.107 --> 21:19.750
And also on the occasion when I've lost friends who have been honored and of course it's a very touching ceremony.

21:20.692 --> 21:26.959
I've done 24 muster speeches, and it is a moving experience.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.746
And I know of no institution that has anything approximating it.

21:33.467 --> 21:49.146
And I think of that in today's world as a very key Aggie unification event, young and old, male and female, family and so forth.

21:49.126 --> 21:53.699
This I'm also putting on this tape for the sake of anyone who reads it in the future.

21:55.103 --> 21:59.997
I have the impression from all the interviews I've done that muster until World War II

22:00.567 --> 22:11.886
and the Corregidor muster was very much smaller in number of people and feeling and so forth than today.

22:11.946 --> 22:21.141
That World War II transformed it just as bonfire was much smaller before World War II than it would be after that.

22:21.121 --> 22:28.461
Other experiences that first year that helped to make you into more of an Aggie?

22:29.885 --> 22:35.822
Football games, midnight yell practice, muster, what else?

22:36.646 --> 22:39.769
Well, bonfire, of course, you mentioned, yes.

22:40.029 --> 22:48.877
And then just the on-campus atmosphere and environment.

22:49.057 --> 23:01.209
I mean, being, you know, walking from place to place and having squadrons of the Corps, you know, marching around campus or, you know, doing their runs or whatever.

23:01.649 --> 23:06.113
And so that was just a very different environment for me.

23:06.093 --> 23:11.665
But it took a while for me to develop just a real strong attachment.

23:11.885 --> 23:23.950
You know, since I didn't have that as part of my, you know, family culture or prior background, a lot I just stumbled upon, I think Fish Camp can be very instrumental and I'd recommend that.

23:23.930 --> 23:38.214
And I have a sister who participated in fish camp, but that's very instrumental in getting someone kicked off and understanding about the Aggie culture traditions.

23:38.494 --> 23:42.040
Somebody told me that Bonfire was a maroon baptism.

23:42.020 --> 23:47.846
I mean, excuse me, Fish Camp was a maroon baptism, and I think that's not a bad name.

23:49.728 --> 24:06.205
Among your co-ed friends as an undergraduate, were you unusual that you didn't have any brothers that had gone to A&M, or were there lots of other co-eds who didn't have a family A&M link?

24:07.315 --> 24:12.101
It seemed to me that a majority did have some kind of link.

24:12.121 --> 24:27.401
And either a sibling or a parent or an older boyfriend that had preceded them in coming to A&M and occasions that they would visit A&M before they ever started going to school here.

24:27.461 --> 24:31.787
So that did seem to be predominant.

24:32.493 --> 24:37.062
And then I started working my sophomore year.

24:38.345 --> 24:43.275
And so I was divided in that I, you know, I was working very soon full time.

24:43.756 --> 24:44.718
For Channel 3?

24:44.778 --> 24:46.962
For Channel 3 at KBTX TV.

24:47.123 --> 24:48.325
How did you land that?

24:48.642 --> 24:59.768
Well, I took it to heart in my journalism classes when they told me that it was very important to have experience to accompany my degree, some kind of internship or job.

25:00.309 --> 25:03.236
And I did investigate at the Eagle.

25:03.256 --> 25:05.301
I was a print major.

25:05.281 --> 25:25.095
at the time but there was not an opening and there happened to be someone else from Channel 3 who worked at Channel 3 in one of my classes and I did go over there and end up getting hired for a job but I was motivated because of the encouragement from my professors.

25:25.463 --> 25:32.453
In all these interviews, I'm trying to kind of use as a kind of a doorstep measurement.

25:32.493 --> 25:33.635
What was your first pay?

25:34.296 --> 25:35.337
We're not going to ask about what.

25:35.658 --> 25:39.183
Well, my first pay was whatever was minimum wage at the time.

25:39.203 --> 25:39.683
Is that right?

25:39.884 --> 25:41.166
And I think that was in the $2.

25:41.967 --> 25:43.128
For Channel 3?

25:43.289 --> 25:43.729
Yes.

25:44.731 --> 25:45.912
And you said full time.

25:45.932 --> 25:47.114
Do you mean 40 hours?

25:47.935 --> 25:49.457
It became very soon.

25:49.558 --> 25:54.745
I started out being hired under a half time.

25:56.918 --> 25:58.380
And what were your duties?

25:58.400 --> 25:58.921
Agreement.

25:59.381 --> 26:04.067
But that grew very quickly to be full-time plus.

26:05.389 --> 26:09.114
And I started out being hired as a reporter.

26:10.776 --> 26:24.293
They had had a news director, a sportscaster, and a weatherman, and talk show host up to that point, but they had not ever expanded to have a reporting staff.

26:24.273 --> 26:38.737
So I supplemented the news directors, the first staff reporter, and then within a couple of months, Jack Hodges was hired to join me.

26:39.479 --> 26:48.694
And so we were the first regular weekday reporters, as we understood, as we were told at the time, and I was the first female.

26:48.674 --> 26:55.264
There had been a woman talk show host, but there had not ever been any women on the news.

26:55.324 --> 26:56.566
Was that Billie Jean Baron?

26:56.666 --> 26:58.949
Was she still the talk show host, hostess?

26:58.969 --> 26:59.430
I don't know.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.311
Fern Hammond.

27:00.652 --> 27:01.553
Oh, Fern, sure.

27:02.735 --> 27:06.380
Was the host at the time that I started there.

27:06.781 --> 27:11.828
And then shortly after Fern, Phyllis Dozier.

27:11.848 --> 27:15.193
Back in the 60s, there had been an afternoon before the networks.

27:15.293 --> 27:17.837
It was called Talk of the Town.

27:17.885 --> 27:19.687
Well, yes, and the name.

27:20.148 --> 27:20.729
Stayed.

27:22.211 --> 27:28.419
What were your, do you remember some early reporting stories, some experiences?

27:28.759 --> 27:44.820
Well, yes, just right off the bat, you know, we were out on the scene at different events and activities, and my first experience was in running camera and observing and learning on the job.

27:46.420 --> 27:48.081
Let's see, I started in March.

27:49.643 --> 27:59.151
The first time that I held a microphone in my hand, the first person I did an interview with was Nancy Reagan.

28:00.653 --> 28:04.456
She came through to campaign for Ronald Reagan in 1976.

28:05.077 --> 28:10.642
I interviewed her at Easterwood Airport, and we were on the way.

28:10.682 --> 28:16.427
I was to run camera when my news director suddenly said, well, why don't you ask the questions?

28:16.407 --> 28:24.866
And I have a picture of that, a print from a frame of the film that I keep in my office.

28:26.009 --> 28:33.286
There was a crowd, and so that was my first performance under fire to ask Nancy Reagan questions in front of a big audience.

28:33.406 --> 28:35.631
Do you remember any key question you asked her?

28:35.611 --> 28:40.903
Yes, and I still have the film, the sound on film of that interview.

28:40.943 --> 28:43.869
And it was a very staccato exchange.

28:44.831 --> 28:51.145
She was running late, and I had had time to think about my questions and to memorize them.

28:52.368 --> 28:53.350
And...

28:54.494 --> 28:58.120
In hindsight, I think she was a little bit nervous also.

28:58.160 --> 29:12.905
She was a little bit terse and short with her answers, and I wasn't seasoned enough to follow up on her answers, so I just went through my list of questions very quickly, and there was just this question, answer, question, answer.

29:12.965 --> 29:16.671
I asked her about John Connelly and

29:16.651 --> 29:30.031
her opinions on a couple of the issues at the time and I'd have to refresh myself looking at that film though but it didn't take us too long to run through the questions.

29:30.091 --> 29:32.134
What was your impression of her as a person?

29:33.777 --> 29:36.000
She's very petite.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.165
She was presented with a football

29:40.073 --> 29:41.376
And she held onto it.

29:41.717 --> 29:44.363
She held onto it close to her chest the whole time.

29:45.406 --> 29:56.833
And the way she held onto it and the terseness of her answers and those big eyes, you know, I really thought she was about as afraid of me as I was of her.

29:56.813 --> 29:59.357
But I was not a big town investigative reporter.

29:59.377 --> 30:01.962
I'm sure I wasn't what she was used to or expecting.

30:02.242 --> 30:07.111
And so she warmed up, though.

30:07.131 --> 30:20.374
You could tell when she gave her presentation to the students that she enjoyed interacting and the spontaneity of the interactive audience question and answer.

30:20.354 --> 30:26.400
Now, her husband was contesting Ford for the Republican nomination in 76.

30:26.580 --> 30:26.860
Right.

30:27.741 --> 30:30.964
Okay, and Jimmy Carter would be the Democratic nominee and would win.

30:31.504 --> 30:33.506
Okay, so he doesn't get the nomination.

30:33.546 --> 30:48.420
Who were some other famous or otherwise memorable personalities you... A&M was a good draw, so it was a wonderful experience to start here with the first job in journalism.

30:49.075 --> 30:59.051
I interviewed every governor that we had, well, and from then on through my experience with the Extension Service.

31:01.394 --> 31:08.085
But let's see, I think Dolph Briscoe was a governor, one of the governors at the time, or might have been the whole time that I worked there.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.552
Mark White was...
