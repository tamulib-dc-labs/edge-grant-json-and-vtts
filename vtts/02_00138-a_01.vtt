00:02.748 --> 00:04.570
Everybody's built that bonfire that year. I'll 
show you these pictures of the bonfire of 48.

00:13.601 --> 00:18.967
It was an upper-class privilege to work on the 
bonfire. Freshmen could guard it, but they could

00:18.987 --> 00:25.995
not work on the bonfire because that was an 
upper-class privilege. But could freshmen help

00:26.015 --> 00:29.459
cut out in the cut area? No. We were not, or at least I 
don't know of anyone who went out there. We would

00:38.563 --> 00:51.180
build our little campfires around the bonfire, 
and we would guard it to keep anybody from sneaking

00:38.563 --> 00:51.180
in there and setting it off. About how long did the 
work on the bonfire last? About how many weeks? Oh,

01:01.237 --> 01:08.685
I would say at

01:01.237 --> 01:08.685
least for possibly six weeks. And the, so the 
upperclassmen, I'm using sophomores now as an

01:08.705 --> 01:15.593
upperclassman, they're the ones that did the 
cutting and the hauling. Yes. And it was, Bonfire

01:17.575 --> 01:21.939
was erected on the drill field. On the drill field. 
Up in the corner opposite the YMCA. Mm-hmm.

01:30.749 --> 01:30.889
Mm-hmm. And it was one log height that was not a 
double stack. It was a teepee style as you see in

01:39.877 --> 01:42.701
these pictures. We had a center pole which was 
actually two telephone poles lashed together and

01:42.721 --> 01:53.176
set in the ground six or eight feet. Were there any 
pranks or anything by anybody to try to Did anybody

01:59.793 --> 02:02.556
try to set it off on fire or anything like that? Very 
definitely. In the fall of 48,

02:04.418 --> 02:13.949
we were 0 and 9 going into the Texas game. One 
afternoon during English class, we were up on the

02:15.090 --> 02:22.198
third floor of the academic building. The windows 
were open, and we heard this airplane noise. And we

02:26.963 --> 02:28.905
looked out. and had a perfect view of the drill 
field. And here came this light airplane in a

02:32.996 --> 02:35.878
slight dive. And the door opened on the airplane 
and out tumbled this silvery looking thing, which

02:37.260 --> 02:50.692
turned out to be a five gallon can of gas with a rag 
wick stuffed in it. And these guys had lit that

02:52.354 --> 02:57.559
thing in the airplane and kicked it out. And they 
missed by a good margin. And by the time the can of

03:03.892 --> 03:18.811
gasoline, five gallon can, hit the ground, it put 
the wick out and gasoline went all over the ground

03:03.892 --> 03:18.811
and nothing caught. Well, they came back around 
and tried it again. And this time, we were able to

03:21.153 --> 03:25.639
get the NC number the registration number off the 
underside of the wing. And somebody, I don't

03:30.465 --> 03:40.859
remember who it was, went to one of the professor's 
offices and called Easterwood Tower and gave them

03:30.465 --> 03:40.859
the number on the wing. And they put that on the CAA 
wire and it went to all airports in the area. And

03:48.809 --> 03:55.137
this particular airplane, to no one's surprise, 
came out of Austin. By the time they landed back at

03:56.011 --> 04:03.701
Robert Miller Airport, they had a delegation out 
there to meet them. I don't know whatever happened

04:03.721 --> 04:07.065
to them, but I'm sure they got in a lot of trouble. 
And they weren't Aggies. They were not Aggies. I

04:10.549 --> 04:12.752
mean, the people meeting them, they were in 
federal trouble. Oh, they were in federal

04:13.132 --> 04:18.579
trouble, all kinds of trouble. Let's go back now, 
football season. Describe what it was like for a

04:21.022 --> 04:25.528
fish to go to Aggie football games. It was a 
highlight, the social highlight. Everything

04:31.343 --> 04:34.246
revolved around athletics. Your social life 
revolved around athletics, with the exception of

04:34.266 --> 04:46.358
an occasional ballman row dance or Bob Hope coming 
to town with Les Brown and his band right now. The

04:46.378 --> 04:49.822
social activity revolved around football games. 
And those of us who had dates, I was still unmarried

04:54.719 --> 04:57.783
during the football season. Our dates would come 
up, and we'd make arrangements for them to live at

04:59.385 --> 05:12.460
professors' houses, or those of us who could 
afford it would put them up at the Aggieland Inn.

05:12.761 --> 05:14.363
Did you do that even as a freshman? Yeah. Oh, sure. 
Is a freshman privileged to have a date? And the

05:20.270 --> 05:21.992
better looking, the better. Do you have any idea, 
what did an overnight fee cost at the Aggieland Inn

05:22.360 --> 05:30.676
or the faculty member's home? Well, the faculty 
member's home was nothing. And at the Aggieland

05:36.207 --> 05:39.694
Inn, I don't know, I think it was

05:43.758 --> 05:46.381
Eight or nine bucks, something like that. Big 
money for that. You saved up all season for that.

05:53.009 --> 05:58.596
Now you were, you had this very important young 
lady from high school that you had known? Yes, I

05:58.616 --> 05:59.677
did. She was my high school sweetheart. She came to 
games even when your freshman year? Yes, my folks

06:04.863 --> 06:07.727
would bring her to games. And they would either 
drive back after the game or my folks and she would

06:13.475 --> 06:22.167
stay at the Andersons' home as their guests. All 
right, for you as a fish, was there a march-in in

06:22.187 --> 06:28.316
those days of the Corps? Oh yeah, couldn't get out 
of that. We had march-ins just like you do today.

06:35.907 --> 06:39.111
And then how did you meet her in the stands?

06:43.934 --> 06:46.336
Did y'all have previously agreed upon place? Yes, 
we did. Because the student section, there was no

06:49.499 --> 06:51.881
reserved seating. And I'd say, why don't you sit 
around the 20 or 30 yard line? You know, fish in

06:59.107 --> 07:08.595
those days, you had to sit down low and you had to sit 
down near the goal line. And I would say, get as far

07:08.615 --> 07:12.979
up to the 20 yard line as you can. And when we're 
dismissed, I'll meet you there. And do you

07:18.489 --> 07:24.818
remember any important football game events or 
experiences? There was nearly always a dance

07:25.599 --> 07:30.326
before the game on Friday night. In Sabisa? Well, 
the big dances would be on Saturday night, of

07:34.292 --> 07:38.278
course, after the game. At Sabisa? At Sabisa. 
Sabisa was... That was a place where if you were

07:44.532 --> 07:54.264
going to have an orchestra, and usually we would 
have Aggieland orchestra, which was very good, by

07:44.532 --> 07:54.264
the

07:44.532 --> 07:54.264
way. When there was a dance after the game, or any 
other big dance, what did a young man and a young

07:55.505 --> 08:04.416
woman wear to Aggie dances then? We wore our 
uniforms. And what did they wear? The young ladies

08:07.820 --> 08:10.423
wore suitable dresses. They were not formal 
dances. The only time we had formal dances was when

08:13.118 --> 08:18.906
we would have big bands, like Vaughn Monroe, Les 
Brown. Then it would be formal. Or the ring dance,

08:21.590 --> 08:25.636
or the... Boot dance. The boot dance, and... 
Cotton ball. Cotton ball, sweetheart ball, the

08:30.783 --> 08:33.807
big balls. How did Aggies and their dates behave at 
those dances? Just as... the Sunday school crowd

08:42.059 --> 08:46.103
would have been proud of us. Now, did anybody, 
that's the answer I expected. I was at the dance.

08:50.628 --> 08:51.189
Yeah. But did anybody tell you as a fish or at any 
other time how you were supposed to behave? Or did

08:57.936 --> 09:00.198
you, did everybody just understand that? Yeah, we 
just understood. And you palled around at a dance.

09:08.267 --> 09:10.990
You palled around with upperclassmen. Mm-hmm. 
And Of course, the athletes were a pretty

09:11.675 --> 09:16.762
close-knit group to begin with. And we would, our 
sport would get a table. We'd have all track

09:25.773 --> 09:26.955
people. Football guys would have two or three 
football tables. And we'd intermingle like that.

09:32.422 --> 09:34.545
And we'd dance with each other's dates. And we'd 
just have a big time. Now, did you and your track

09:37.679 --> 09:44.527
buddies, did you all feel that you were truly part 
of the student body and accepted by them? Oh,

09:45.168 --> 09:45.969
absolutely. That's the answer I expected. 
Absolutely. In fact, we were put up on a slight

09:50.274 --> 09:56.421
pedestal. Not too high, you understand, because 
you don't want to fish to get a big head. But we were

10:02.128 --> 10:06.353
pretty well thought of, I'll put it that way. And 
did you go on a core trip your freshman year? Yes, I

10:10.582 --> 10:14.725
went on a core trip to Austin. What was that like? 
Well, it was pretty inspiring for me and some of my

10:17.188 --> 10:35.344
fish buddies because we were 09 when we went down to 
Austin and we just had to figure out some way to make

10:36.286 --> 10:38.549
the TSIPs pay if we couldn't beat them. So some of 
the agronomy students told some of the fish

10:39.751 --> 10:52.830
students, look, we've got this new hybrid 
ryegrass seed, guaranteed to sprout. All it needs

10:52.870 --> 10:54.252
is a little water. So we got, I don't know, 200 or 300 
pounds of that and sneaked into Memorial Stadium

10:56.375 --> 11:05.128
in the dark of night. about the second week of 
September. Now, who is we? I mean, November. Who is

11:13.452 --> 11:14.273
we? Who is we? Probably the same bunch of us that 
stole the outhouse. Billy Bless, Don Graves,

11:21.424 --> 11:25.550
Marshall Sorrell, me, Jody Zurn. One car load? Two 
car loads. Two car loads. Actually, a car load and

11:29.216 --> 11:34.744
pickup truck load because we had to carry the grass 
seed down there. Anyhow, we snuck into Memorial

11:35.399 --> 11:37.341
Stadium. How'd you get into the stadium? We just 
climbed over the gate. Okay. There were no guards.

11:44.831 --> 11:45.131
Yeah, yeah. No guards. And if we couldn't have got 
in through the gate, we'd have scaled the wall. It

11:50.738 --> 11:51.760
was nothing for us. We were athletes. And we, from 
goal line to goal line, we put a big A, M. Fifty yards

12:05.555 --> 12:07.157
to the letter. And the greenskeepers were very 
accommodating there at Austin, and they kept the

12:09.100 --> 12:17.633
field watered. As luck would have it, about a week 
before Thanksgiving, we had a good hard freeze,

12:19.095 --> 12:27.528
which killed the Bermuda. Oh, oh, oh. This was 
hybrid ryegrass. Didn't harm the ryegrass. That,

12:33.951 --> 12:38.035
all that water that they had been putting on there 
stimulated it. And with the Bermuda turning

12:38.896 --> 12:43.921
brown, the ryegrass just stood out green. And 
there it was. Did anybody here officially know who

12:46.924 --> 12:51.508
had done that? Oh, no. No. Absolutely not. Did, 
did. Their lips were sealed. And how long was it

12:58.756 --> 13:01.178
before that secret got out? As to who? Oh, nobody 
ever knew. Is that right? Is that right? Nobody, at

13:07.290 --> 13:09.052
least nobody ever admitted it. And I presume it was 
in the paper. It was in the paper. It was in the, the

13:12.655 --> 13:20.343
bat had a big story on it in the Austin paper. Y'all 
left here about what time of night to go there and do

13:21.584 --> 13:24.347
it? Oh, we left here around, I don't know, 9 
o'clock. Got down there about 11 or 11.30. And we

13:31.674 --> 13:33.055
were back in our bunks by two.

13:37.997 --> 13:47.433
And Colonel Boatner never asked for the guilty 
party to step forward, which surprised us. And I

13:48.976 --> 13:55.326
don't know what we would have done if he had made 
that demand. I think we would have taken the tack

13:56.288 --> 13:58.772
that He's just doing this to go through the 
motions. He doesn't really expect anybody to step

14:02.662 --> 14:05.527
forward. Now, as far as you remember, whose idea 
was it? Who thought it up?

14:13.121 --> 14:14.043
I have no idea. Somebody just proposed it in a 
late-night bull session. And how did y'all pay for

14:20.073 --> 14:21.736
the seed? We didn't. The senior agronomy students 
made it available. That's what I was going to say.

14:27.747 --> 14:28.868
It just happened to come out. It was made 
available. Okay, okay. But that senior did not go

14:32.892 --> 14:38.077
with y'all to, was it all fish that did the 
scattering? It was all fish. The same dirty half

14:40.819 --> 14:43.682
dozen. And so what did you and your buddies do when 
you went to the game and looked at it? We just

14:55.368 --> 15:01.818
We just slapped each other on the back, and 
everybody said, that's good bull. Now, you went

15:04.282 --> 15:11.092
over there for the Corps trip, and you marched down 
Congress. Marched up Congress Avenue. How did you

15:13.697 --> 15:20.447
and your buddies feel being part of the Corps 
marching like that?

15:24.325 --> 15:25.908
We were damn proud. Damn proud. Now, did the crowd 
standing on the curbs, did they respond

15:28.712 --> 15:35.843
positively? Very positively. All right. Now, 
there's another one. In all these interviews,

15:38.908 --> 15:48.223
when I've asked that question, nobody yet has 
offered any bad, you know, somebody said

15:38.908 --> 15:48.223
something or threw something or was an Everybody 
says, no, no, no. They were always very

15:49.873 --> 15:51.395
respectful. Now, I presume, and the game, 
unfortunately, did not come out favorably for the

15:51.915 --> 15:56.119
Aggies. Well, it did if you look on a tie as a 
favorable outcome, especially since we were

15:56.639 --> 16:07.830
about four touchdowns underdog. We tied them 
14-14, and we scored from scrimmage. toward South

16:18.106 --> 16:19.809
Gold. That's right, that's right. So you go home 
Christmas. How did you feel about being an Aggie

16:26.018 --> 16:31.746
and academically, how did you feel that you were 
doing here?

16:34.811 --> 16:46.408
We had gotten our midterm grade reports, I don't 
know, I guess first part of November, and those of

16:34.811 --> 16:46.408
us who did well felt quite proud. turned in all A's 
that first semester. I didn't find it as

16:50.688 --> 16:55.755
challenging as high school, to tell you the truth. 
And were you already, you were already working out

16:56.315 --> 16:59.039
for track? Colonel Andy says everybody will hit 
the cross-country course. Shot putters, discus

17:07.890 --> 17:16.581
throwers, high jumpers, sprinters, hurdlers, 
distance men, everybody went out on the

17:07.890 --> 17:16.581
cross-country course. which started on the west 
side of the track opposite the old depot where the

17:17.236 --> 17:26.425
old creamery was. And we went clockwise

17:27.846 --> 17:36.114
around the course. And all it was was an old gravel 
road. It was hazardous because it had rocks on it

17:39.517 --> 17:45.943
the size of double fists. But Colonel Andy 
insisted that everybody go out there and do it. And

17:49.678 --> 17:58.469
that road happened to go through the pig farm where 
George Bush Library now stands. I don't know if he

17:58.489 --> 17:59.991
knows that or not. But those of us who were not 
cross-country inclined found shortcuts that

18:00.832 --> 18:15.812
after we'd get down there a quarter of a mile or so, 
and we would cut across. And we would sit out in the

18:16.366 --> 18:27.938
middle of the pasture out there, allow a suitable 
amount of time to go by, and then we would go finish

18:16.366 --> 18:27.938
the rest of the course. Of course, I'm sure it 
wasn't any secret to Colonel Andy what we were

18:29.480 --> 18:32.563
doing. But it was really hazardous, because a lot 
of guys would turn their ankles on those rocks. And

18:41.072 --> 18:46.137
I think he kind of weaned himself off of that in 
later years. Now, A&M wasn't doing indoor track

18:46.555 --> 18:50.480
then. There wasn't, was it? No, there was no indoor 
track. That's what I thought. So you go home

18:54.404 --> 19:04.436
Christmas looking forward to the spring, and that 
special young lady was there. And did you feel that

19:05.117 --> 19:09.062
you'd made a good choice about where to go to 
college and all? Were you feeling good about being

19:09.102 --> 19:11.165
an Aggie? I felt good about being an Aggie. Excuse 
me, but I was having a little problem on the home

19:15.850 --> 19:24.743
front there because she was enrolled at Lamar.

19:27.787 --> 19:29.730
It was a junior college at that time. And her folks 
were making noises about sending her to Austin,

19:30.931 --> 19:39.383
Texas University. And we talked this over and I 
said, hey, that's not gonna work. You know, I can't

19:45.719 --> 19:55.771
be running down there to Austin, and I can 
hitchhike, but you don't have a car, and you won't

19:45.719 --> 19:55.771
be able to come up to College Station unless you 
find somebody who does. And you're going to be down

19:55.812 --> 20:02.520
there with all those frat rats, and I don't know how 
this is going to work out. And she said, well, don't

20:02.540 --> 20:05.844
worry about it. Well, I was worried about it, 
because she was a very popular girl. She was a class

20:11.691 --> 20:13.093
favorite. class beauty and all this kind of stuff. 
And I had made inquiries to some of the assistant

20:17.350 --> 20:40.233
coaches at Texas since I hadn't run into track meet 
with the maroon and white yet, if their offer of a

20:17.350 --> 20:40.233
scholarship was still open. And they said, yes, it 
was.

20:45.018 --> 20:58.432
Just to show you what integrity there was among 
coaches in those days, Clyde Littlefield called

20:45.018 --> 20:58.432
me and he said, yes, your scholarship is still 
open, but have you thought this over and have you

20:45.018 --> 20:58.432
talked to Colonel Andy? I said, no, I have not 
talked to him yet because I didn't feel there was

20:59.293 --> 21:09.423
any point in talking to him until I found out 
whether you had a place for me. There were no limits

21:10.404 --> 21:13.067
on scholarships in those days. And he said, yes, 
it's still open, but I'd advise you to talk to

21:14.633 --> 21:20.903
Colonel Andy. I said, yes, I'll do that. Well, the 
next thing I knew, the next day, bright and early,

21:24.650 --> 21:32.823
Colonel Andy was at my dorm room before I went to 
breakfast. Clyde Littlefield had called him the

21:33.665 --> 21:38.633
night before and said, I need to tell you this. And 
they were great friends. And so he came up to see me

21:43.612 --> 21:47.798
and asked me what was wrong. And I said, my girl is 
going to go to Texas. And I can see me just losing out

21:50.743 --> 21:54.889
big time. And he said, well, we've got to try to work 
something out. I said, I'm working on it

22:00.958 --> 22:02.720
currently, Andy. I'm working on it. So at midterm, 
my fish year. I just said, hey, I'm getting more

22:10.270 --> 22:20.945
worried by the minute, and I'm not able to 
concentrate and work out properly and study

22:10.270 --> 22:20.945
properly. Let's get married. So we did. We 
borrowed her folks' car and went to Cone Springs in

22:26.152 --> 22:39.130
San Jacinto County and got a Methodist minister 
out of bed and got him to marry us. And then we went

22:41.017 --> 22:44.642
back home and told our folks.

22:47.586 --> 22:48.507
Did they both approve? Didn't have much choice. It 
was a fait accompli. All right, and that's at

22:54.776 --> 22:56.398
midterm? Midterm. Okay. And so then did you, did 
she come up here? Not right away. Okay. Because

23:06.792 --> 23:09.315
there was just no place. Right. There were a lot of 
veterans who had taken up all the available

23:10.548 --> 23:15.113
housing. There were no apartments. The kind of 
thing that you see today just didn't exist. Before

23:23.482 --> 23:31.491
you got married that fall, how did you and she 
communicate? Phone calls, letters, what?

23:33.614 --> 23:33.974
Letters. Phone calls were too expensive. Three 
cents. About how often? Oh, two or three times a

23:40.147 --> 23:43.250
week. And did your folks call you? No, there was no 
place they could call. Hart Hall didn't have a

23:49.997 --> 23:51.618
telephone. Did you write back and forth to your 
parents? Wrote back and forth. Did your mom send

23:55.883 --> 23:57.324
some kush? She sent kush. She sent fish packages, 
we called them. And of course, I would go home about

24:02.630 --> 24:10.137
maybe two weekends a month. You recall my roommate 
had a car, and he was in Beaumont. And we'd go home at

24:18.187 --> 24:26.857
least once a month, and perhaps I would hitchhike 
the other weekend. So I was home a couple times a

24:26.877 --> 24:29.020
month. Alright, so that second semester your 
freshman year, you're married, but your wife's

24:29.581 --> 24:34.386
still in Beaumont. And what effect does those 
realities have on your academic and athletic

24:34.855 --> 24:43.066
efforts that spring?

24:49.034 --> 24:50.216
I made all A's again. And the work wasn't that 
tough, to tell you the truth. And I was undefeated.

25:00.978 --> 25:01.999
my freshman year. And you ran both hurdles? Ran 
both hurdles. Did you run a relay also? I ran mile

25:06.983 --> 25:10.186
relay and sprint relay. What was it, for you as a 
hurdler, what was it like, the difference between

25:10.947 --> 25:20.455
the height of the high school and the college high 
hurdles? Was that a tough adjustment? Not for me.

25:26.961 --> 25:30.664
Some of the guys coming out of high school had 
trouble adjusting to the highs. Billy Bless, for

25:36.069 --> 25:39.953
example, had trouble adjusting to the highs. He 
was a little gun-shy because he would hit his left

25:39.973 --> 25:54.712
knee on the hurdle, and he bloodied and bruised his 
left knee up pretty high, which as a consequence

25:39.973 --> 25:54.712
would force him to go to the hurdles even higher. Of 
course, if you do that, the more time you spend in

25:54.732 --> 26:01.360
the air means less time spent on the ground 
running. I was fortunate enough that I could get

26:01.576 --> 26:06.281
over. There was just a three-inch difference, and 
after a couple of weeks, it didn't make that much

26:06.321 --> 26:14.950
difference to me. Describe your practice routine 
once the weather gets warm enough where you can

26:14.970 --> 26:22.838
really work out consistently outside. I would 
usually start out with a

26:24.079 --> 26:31.026
lap or two to warm up This is all inside Kyle Field? 
Inside Kyle Field. It's the only track we had.

26:40.586 --> 26:44.070
We would run the straightaways and jog the curves. 
We'd do that for a couple of three laps and then we

26:44.871 --> 27:01.772
would go practice a few starts and we'd put up the 
hurdles and run through say half a flight of

26:44.871 --> 27:01.772
hurdles and about twice a week we'd run 
competition with a full flight of hurdles, both

27:02.714 --> 27:08.983
high and low. And you worked out about how long? 
We'd work out about two hours, two and a half hours.

27:15.072 --> 27:16.755
When in the afternoon was that? Generally from, we 
would arrange our schedule and the profs in the

27:17.336 --> 27:25.988
registrar were very accommodating. They'd let us 
terminate our classes around 2 to 3 o'clock,

27:31.098 --> 27:35.725
unless you had a lab-type class in the afternoon. 
Then you might not get out till 4. And we'd get out

27:38.609 --> 27:41.694
there about 3, work out till about 5.30. Describe 
Coach Andy as a coach at practice. What did he do and

27:47.223 --> 27:48.805
not do? What was his routine? Colonel Andy was kind 
of a low-key type coach. He was not a lot of

27:56.096 --> 28:00.042
hands-on. Colonel Andy and Ray Putnam,

28:00.308 --> 28:05.314
they were the coaches. Ray Putnam handled quarter 
milers and above in terms of distance. Colonel

28:11.041 --> 28:15.627
Andy handled sprinters, hurdlers, and field 
event men. And he'd spend quite a bit of time with

28:16.788 --> 28:19.852
the field event people. And he would work with us on 
our starts, particularly. and he left me pretty

28:29.958 --> 28:44.875
much alone on the hurdles because I guess he 
figured I had learned all the technique I was going

28:29.958 --> 28:44.875
to learn at that stage of the game and he wasn't 
going to mess with it. He from time to time would say

28:45.736 --> 28:55.468
have you tried this or could you get your lead arm 
down a little bit lower or something like that and

28:45.736 --> 28:55.468
that was about it. Now did you have a model hurdler 
that was your your uh idol your no no i didn't um i

28:58.612 --> 29:25.665
knew about guys like freddie walcott who set the 
world record at 13-7 but you i'd never met him i'd

28:58.612 --> 29:25.665
never seen him run you had no movies of people in 
those days you had still photos and You really had

29:27.063 --> 29:30.027
nothing to learn from. And did you have a goal that 
first year of time or anything? No, I had no goal

29:36.354 --> 29:42.862
other than just to run as hard and as fast as I could, 
as often as I could. Now, in the Southwest

29:43.142 --> 29:48.589
Conference in those days, the Aggies and the 
Longhorns were the two best teams. Weren't they in

29:48.629 --> 29:49.490
track? So was Rice. Rice was right up there. Oh, 
that's right. That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who

29:54.456 --> 29:55.517
was coaching Rice then?

29:58.484 --> 30:01.067
One of the football coaches, if I'm not mistaken. 
Yeah. Rice had Augie Erfer. Yeah, yeah. Tobin

30:03.450 --> 30:04.171
wrote.

30:09.897 --> 30:19.568
They had Red Brown, Otha Bird,

30:09.897 --> 30:19.568
Bill Houghton.

30:19.729 --> 30:21.290
Tommy Cox. Don't forget Tommy Cox. And there were 
freshman meets then. When, what was your, do you

30:25.594 --> 30:31.361
remember your first meet as a college student? I 
remember it very clearly. Where? The first meet we

30:34.145 --> 30:51.407
had was a

30:34.145 --> 30:51.407
triangular meet with North Texas and

30:54.998 --> 30:55.819
John Tarleton. John Tarleton ran against the 
Fish. They were in junior college. And even at the

31:01.545 --> 31:06.510
big meets, junior college Fish would always run 
together. And I remember that John Tarleton had a

31:07.451 --> 31:20.145
hurdler and North Texas had a hurdler.
