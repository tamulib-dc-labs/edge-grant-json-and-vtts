00:01.027 --> 00:24.609
I was born in Natchez, Mississippi,

00:01.027 --> 00:24.609
where

00:01.027 --> 00:24.609
the old South still is, November the 3rd, 1893, in 
Arlington Heights. Can you tell us about your

00:27.112 --> 00:29.734
parents and your early years? My mother died at the 
age of three, my age of three, and I was raised by my

00:31.975 --> 00:42.009
grandparents and my aunt in Natchez, 
Mississippi.

00:45.434 --> 00:57.190
I attended the public schools and the cathedral 
Catholic school run by the Brothers of Sacred

00:45.434 --> 00:57.190
Heart, and they were tough. While coming up in 
Natchez, you know that is the antebellum south. A

01:03.353 --> 01:04.715
lot of things happened there. For instance, Aaron 
Bull was concealed in 1807 in Windy Hill, Maine,

01:05.556 --> 01:12.866
after he killed Alexander Hamilton. So we were 
raised in a history of traditions. Every home, old

01:18.534 --> 01:25.624
home in Natchez, had some meaning in the 
historical part of our country.

01:28.523 --> 01:37.491
In Natchez, outside of, not too far from there, was 
the Jefferson Military College, which was

01:28.523 --> 01:37.491
attended at one time by Jefferson Davis. I saw that 
school grow, and I saw LSU play there many, many

01:39.433 --> 01:43.777
years ago as a child. In the city of Natchez, there 
were a lot of Confederate veterans, and as a child,

01:46.119 --> 01:57.670
I'd listen to their tales, and from them, I learned 
the word, patria, that your country comes first,

01:46.119 --> 01:57.670
and you come next. There were two National Guard 
companies in Natchez. And every time then I'd get a

02:01.880 --> 02:06.687
chance, I'd go down there and watch them drill. I 
always wanted to be in the military.

02:12.476 --> 02:26.357
After finishing the cathedral school, I had a 
brother over here in Houston who had some friends

02:12.476 --> 02:26.357
connected with the Publishers Department of 
Texas A&M College and Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

02:27.400 --> 02:32.426
And they prevailed on him to have me, his little 
brother, come over here to Texas A&M. But in the

02:32.887 --> 02:51.990
meantime, old my uncle's store was a lawyer by the 
name of Lem Connor, who always represented the

02:32.887 --> 02:51.990
Honorable John Sharp Williams, the learned 
senator from Mississippi, who graduated from

02:32.887 --> 02:51.990
Heidelberg and the University of Virginia, who 
had farms down in Yazoo City. I heard him tell Mr.

02:53.827 --> 03:14.065
Conner that he had sent his kid, his boy, John Sharp 
Williams, Jr., to every school in the country, and

02:53.827 --> 03:14.065
he couldn't get along, so he finally sent him to 
Texas A&M College, where the Honorable Jefferson

02:53.827 --> 03:14.065
Davis was offered the presidency of. So I thought 
in my mind that was a good deal when my brother

03:14.085 --> 03:18.990
talked about Texas A&M College. I had some 
knowledge of where I was going.

03:23.847 --> 03:33.406
I entered Antietam College at the age of 16, having 
to take the entrance examination and ended with

03:23.847 --> 03:33.406
the class of 14.

03:37.073 --> 03:40.219
I was assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion. What 
was your dad's? Could you tell me about your dad?

03:46.366 --> 03:46.846
Your father? Yes, I did. I didn't put that. My 
father— You told me about your mother, but you

03:50.430 --> 03:53.873
didn't say anything about your father. Yeah, 
well, my father was a fisherman and made his living

03:55.554 --> 04:00.919
down around Boris, Louisiana. And, of course, 
when my mother died, he married again and he raised

04:02.380 --> 04:06.184
another family. And then they were in the oyster 
business down there. I saw my father only twice

04:11.671 --> 04:17.600
from

04:11.671 --> 04:17.600
infancy. Once, when I was going to World War I, my 
brother insisted I ought to see my dad, so I went on

04:18.882 --> 04:30.979
down the Mississippi River to a place called 
Burris, went across to Ostraka, where he was, and

04:18.882 --> 04:30.979
saw him. And the train on the other side was fixing 
to leave, because it wasn't going to stay a bit long

04:31.860 --> 04:40.513
when I go back across the river, so I saw him only 
only for a short while. My brother insisted I might

04:42.663 --> 04:48.348
get killed and I ought to see my dad as I grew up when I 
was grown. But I did see my father after that. My

04:52.693 --> 04:54.715
father died at the age of 90-something. He fell. He 
cut his head on an axe during a storm at Ostraca,

04:55.356 --> 05:01.622
which is across from Burris. And they took him down 
to New Orleans on a launch. But by the time he'd

05:05.066 --> 05:09.150
arrived in New Orleans, he'd lost so much blood, 
poor fella died.

05:11.881 --> 05:15.984
Could you tell me more about your education before 
you got to Texas A&M? I told you I finished it. I went

05:17.966 --> 05:26.133
to public schools and the cathedral school run by 
the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. Okay, and what

05:26.153 --> 05:28.135
were your favorite subjects? History. History, 
good. I had witnessed and also the Honorable

05:32.919 --> 05:40.765
William Howard Taft came down the Mississippi 
River. Really? as President of the United States.

05:44.572 --> 05:47.096
And in Natchez, there are three bluffs. And one 
bluff is close to Rosalie, which is an old

05:47.116 --> 05:53.745
antebellum home, which was the headquarters of 
General Grant. And that morning, the Honorable

05:55.187 --> 06:07.703
Charles F. Engle, one of the landed young lawyers 
of Natchez, in his morning coat, introduced the

05:55.187 --> 06:07.703
President of the United States. And I said to 
myself, someday, if I could be a lawyer, Like him, I

06:11.872 --> 06:15.597
would be very happy. All right.

06:18.941 --> 06:20.563
So that's why you wanted to become a lawyer? Well, I 
didn't become a lawyer until later. I know it. All

06:24.688 --> 06:25.168
right. Well, anyhow, so we were steeped in 
tradition. And every kid knew what every home

06:30.295 --> 06:34.940
meant and how long it had been there and all of that. 
And the people over there are raising their

06:35.962 --> 06:38.885
children the same way right now. The, uh,

06:44.491 --> 06:50.620
At Texas A&M, I was on probation the biggest part of 
the time. Why was that? Well, because I came from a

06:51.861 --> 06:58.591
school out of the state, and that is the first year I 
was on probation. And I got along all right and was

06:58.611 --> 07:10.768
doing well until I went out on a strike in whatever 
year, 1913, and I made a great mistake because they

06:58.611 --> 07:10.768
changed... from three times to two times. And I was 
out of school some 35, 40 days with the rest of the

07:13.062 --> 07:18.689
people. And in that, I learned in life not to strike 
anything but matches. Now, why did you strike? The

07:25.678 --> 07:33.487
strike was caused on by an investigation of hazing 
over in D Company by one of the Forsyth brothers.

07:34.889 --> 07:39.895
And there was 22 people canned, one of them which 
was a 32nd degree mason. And the other was we had the

07:40.820 --> 07:46.426
meningitis scare. And we were assembled in the 
chapel and told not to worry, not to congregate,

07:46.446 --> 08:01.643
not to stay apart, and that we would escape any 
danger of the disease. But while we were there in

08:01.683 --> 08:06.709
the hall, two days prior to that time, A young man by 
the name of A.W. Coons died. Well, they thought he

08:09.691 --> 08:17.459
died with meningitis, but in testing the serum in 
his spine, they found out they were mistaken. But

08:17.479 --> 08:20.942
this funny incident happened while they were 
telling us to be calm and quiet. There was a fellow

08:22.023 --> 08:24.946
by the name of Pat Crown from Waco. He froze up right 
quick like he had meningitis, and everybody ran

08:25.987 --> 08:33.895
out of every window, every door, and everything 
else out of there. And that evening caught me in a

08:34.364 --> 08:41.174
strike due to the fact we had one doctor and two 
nurses in about 15 beds at that hospital. So that

08:41.794 --> 08:47.663
brought on a strike, which was wrong, of course, 
known as the 466 Club. In my estimate, that's 466

08:48.023 --> 08:51.608
fools, which I was one of them. Because I had to pay 
for that, because when it changed from three times

08:52.469 --> 09:01.342
to two times, there was no way I could make up my 
work, and I finally graduated in 1915. Cut it off.

09:03.345 --> 09:03.645
Cut it off. They

09:05.245 --> 09:17.485
had to raise some money for the track team or 
whatever it was, so they put on a minstrel down at

09:05.245 --> 09:17.485
the athletic field. And I doubled in that. I did a 
blackface as Dr. Ball. And I was such a hit that they

09:27.842 --> 09:31.708
thought I'd make a pretty good candidate for Yale 
leader that year so later on I was made a Yale leader

09:31.823 --> 09:46.561
that next following year and I was assistant but my 
chief Yale leader wanted to play football and I had

09:31.823 --> 09:46.561
to act as chief all during that time and of course as 
a senior I was the head Yale leader. I remember well

09:48.243 --> 09:59.097
that I was taking public speaking in my senior year 
and Dr. Bressler never did call on me the whole time

09:48.243 --> 09:59.097
that I was in his class. I asked him why and he said 
he'd been out to Yale practice and he didn't want to

09:59.667 --> 10:04.233
waste time in class. He was convinced I could make 
the public speech. As a Yale leader I had many woes

10:09.180 --> 10:12.064
at Texas A&M College. Dr. Bazell was down there and 
he was a freshman president from came down there

10:13.086 --> 10:21.117
from CIA and he had different ideas about many 
things. With old Yale practice we were at the old

10:22.138 --> 10:25.523
bandstand and Somebody must have got word back to 
him, because everything that I said or did related

10:26.043 --> 10:38.261
back to him, and the next morning I would see the 
order to come to class to have me go before the

10:26.043 --> 10:38.261
president. In one instant, Doc Wiesel says to me, 
he says, do you see all these telegrams and

10:39.082 --> 10:45.933
letters? I read a few of them, and the letters all 
said I sent my son to Texas A&M College to get an

10:45.953 --> 10:55.527
education not to travel over the state. And I 
understand that they're going to Dallas, San

10:56.080 --> 11:01.388
Antonio, Fort Worth, Houston, Waco. Dr. Bezell 
said, did you say that? I said, we might go. We might

11:06.736 --> 11:08.098
go to these places. I didn't say we were going. He 
said, you be careful what you say out there at that

11:10.221 --> 11:15.128
yell practice because it all goes back to the 
parents. At another time, he called me. We had a

11:18.914 --> 11:25.564
yell called hidey-tidey, tiey-a-didey, 
flim-flam. A lot of times the kids would yell it and

11:25.915 --> 11:33.509
they'd use some

11:25.915 --> 11:33.509
curse words. Gee damn varsity. So Dr. Bazell got me 
up on that and told me to eliminate that yell. I

11:41.083 --> 11:43.507
tried to explain to him that I didn't tell them to do 
that. They'd do that themselves.

11:47.498 --> 11:54.506
He would have me up every now and then to tone me down 
and find out what was going on at Yale practice.

11:54.526 --> 11:57.350
Somebody told him this, some parent wrote this, 
that, and the other. However, I struggled through

11:57.370 --> 12:04.078
the year and was never put on a report or kicked out 
of school for my activity as a Yale leader. What

12:04.578 --> 12:06.360
kind of man did you think he was? I thought Dr. 
Brazell was a fine man,

12:07.722 --> 12:17.033
but I hated to see the Board of Regents of A&M 
College go to a girls' school and bring a president

12:17.519 --> 12:20.903
down there from the CIA. He was a high religious 
man, which I had no objection to, but he made

12:21.363 --> 12:36.239
hypocrites out of a lot of those professors, 
because I remember well Gilbert Allen Giesch, who

12:21.363 --> 12:36.239
was a drunkard off the Philadelphia Ledger who 
taught freehand drawing, you had him carrying the

12:21.363 --> 12:36.239
Bible. Really? And a lot of kids would join his 
Bible class just in order to get favors.

12:45.802 --> 12:53.230
At that time, you know, A&M College, of course, was 
an undersecretary, and everybody had to attend

12:45.802 --> 12:53.230
chapel on Sunday mornings. The Jews were excused, 
and Catholics who would agree to go to Mass in the

12:53.250 --> 13:06.223
brine could go to Mass and not go to chapel. But 
there was a trick in that, too. There was a senior

13:08.445 --> 13:13.851
there at this Mass who always would check in and 
out, so you... You couldn't evade going out of the

13:14.236 --> 13:19.623
church or the chapel.

13:21.686 --> 13:29.796
While I was a senior there, or a junior, I forget, we 
organized the Newman Club, which is a Catholic

13:21.686 --> 13:29.796
club in Lorneville. Last week or ten days, Father 
Matt called me from Bryan, saying that he had

13:31.218 --> 13:41.712
looked into Longhorn and found out that

13:45.775 --> 14:01.740
I was one of the organizers of the Newman Club at 
Texas A&M College, and that he was a chaplain up

13:45.775 --> 14:01.740
there, and that they have 9,000 or more practicing 
Catholics due to the fact they thought of the

13:45.775 --> 14:01.740
Newman Club, which is a going concern at A&M 
College. Cut. I love my professors. I had Dr.

14:05.426 --> 14:09.673
Francis in veterinary and agronomy. And I had a Dr. 
Kiblin, economics. Well, can you tell me a little

14:13.311 --> 14:16.857
bit about Mark Francis, Dr. Mark Francis? What did 
you think of him? Dr. Francis and I were very good

14:19.381 --> 14:22.586
friends. And when I promoted, when I moved out of 
Tentrow and moved over to, finally to Goodman

14:23.928 --> 14:38.091
Hall, I would see Dr. Francis on the campus, and his 
son was a classmate of mine, Beb. And we'd stop and

14:38.847 --> 14:40.549
talk a little bit. So one day Dr. Francis told me, he 
says, what do you know, Vic? Somebody hit me on the

14:45.794 --> 14:48.497
back and said, Jesus Christ, is that you? And Dr. 
Francis told me then, he says, you know, I'm deaf.

14:56.264 --> 14:57.946
And it's a great blessing to be deaf. He says, I 
don't have to hear a whole lot of H.S. from a lot of

15:01.129 --> 15:01.890
people. Dr. Francis was lecturing one day and 
There was a young man named Cogshill who had a

15:09.526 --> 15:21.041
hearing aid on, and Dr. Francis stopped his class 
in a minute, and he ran up the ramp and says, Say, can

15:09.526 --> 15:21.041
you hear out of that damn thing? And the fellow 
shook his head.

15:27.289 --> 15:31.515
So Dr. Francis says, Well, why don't you talk if you 
heard what I said? So he went on down the ramp and

15:34.078 --> 15:37.963
continued his... his lecture. Another time, he 
saw, he stopped his class abruptly and went into

15:41.377 --> 15:58.669
the room, ante room, where we had cadavers and 
things, and took a bucket and he ran up the ramp with

15:41.377 --> 15:58.669
his bucket and he put it in front of this student and 
told him, says, look, spit in this bucket, quit

15:59.678 --> 16:01.961
spitting out of that window. Boy was chewing 
tobacco. And he went back right on down

16:04.424 --> 16:10.673
nonchalantly and nobody cracked a smile and he 
went on with his lecture. Dr. Marsteller was also a

16:10.693 --> 16:16.300
fine lecturer and we all had a lot of respect. And 
once each year, Dr. Francis would devote one

16:16.881 --> 16:21.147
lecture. I don't know whether it's been recorded, 
but it is great. He always told the students, he'd

16:26.594 --> 16:31.763
give one lecture on life insurance, how to start an 
estate. Why would he do that? Why would he do that?

16:35.871 --> 16:38.396
He did that because he loved young people. He loved 
young people. As you well know, Dr. Mark Francis

16:41.100 --> 16:49.075
came to Ohio State University, and you know his 
history about the Texas fever tick and all of that.

16:49.645 --> 16:50.907
Well, what, tell me about his son. What happened to 
his son? His son, they graduated, he had two sons.

16:55.235 --> 16:58.341
One of them died in class of 12, if you look in the 
book. And Mark, and Bev was our classmate. And his

17:02.269 --> 17:08.380
son graduated in veterinary medicine. Well, they 
didn't give a degree in veterinary science in

17:10.216 --> 17:16.663
those days, and that class didn't start until the 
next year. But he had some related degree to

17:16.703 --> 17:23.270
veterinary medicine. The same way with his 
brother. He was in the Army in World War I and II, and

17:26.353 --> 17:32.740
had a furniture store in Bryan. His pictures, one 
of them there. And he had a son, Mark Francis, Jr.,

17:40.557 --> 17:41.778
But Bev is dead. Practically all the members of my 
class in 1915 are dead, and about 18 still living,

17:42.439 --> 17:49.267
and none of them can move about. I've been to these 
class reunions. This year I couldn't go because of

17:52.531 --> 17:59.219
the conflict with the Marine Corps reunion in New 
Orleans. It came the same day, so I couldn't go. But

18:01.602 --> 18:03.103
I've been the only member there. What were your 
favorite classes when you were at A&M? I love

18:07.844 --> 18:11.208
veterinary medicine. I like economics. And of 
course, you don't have any history in your senior

18:13.630 --> 18:19.517
year, but we had history as freshmen. And the

18:19.537 --> 18:29.667
chemistry came hard just like it did to everybody 
else, and I was no exception. I had to take about

18:29.727 --> 18:32.130
four courses in chemistry. And I failed the first 
course in chemistry, and I didn't realize it. Oh,

18:35.752 --> 18:38.277
everybody was saying there's no disgrace to 
failing. But I didn't realize before I could go

18:38.297 --> 18:46.795
another step further, I had to pass that first 
course in chemistry, which I wound up taking four

18:38.297 --> 18:46.795
courses in chemistry before I graduated. I was 
wondering, when you came to A&M, when you decided

18:48.226 --> 19:00.558
to come to A&M, was that because you had talked to a 
lot of these old Confederate soldiers so much, and

18:48.226 --> 19:00.558
because you knew A&M as a military school? Yeah, 
no, patria, the word patria. I knew A&M was a

19:02.240 --> 19:12.951
military school, and what my brother, what John, 
the Honorable John Charles William had said about

19:02.240 --> 19:12.951
the school, and when he connected that with 
Jefferson Davis, I knew that's where I wanted to go

19:02.240 --> 19:12.951
to school. Another favorite professor I had was 
Dr. Kibler, who taught economics. And I well

19:22.202 --> 19:28.138
remember it was his senior year. in the last class. 
They'd been talking about social sciences, and

19:30.030 --> 19:40.805
there's a boy got up from Mason, Texas, by the name 
of Mason, and he said to Dr. Kibler, I've been

19:30.030 --> 19:40.805
listening to you talking about these social 
sciences. Don't you have to have, don't you have to

19:40.885 --> 19:46.713
promote poverty for social sciences to be a 
success? At that time, Dr. Kibler said, sit down,

19:47.434 --> 19:52.441
we'll meet some other time, or we never did meet any 
time. However, those words from Mason is brought

19:55.473 --> 20:10.009
up through the years and that we have all this 
social science, all this relief, all this food

19:55.473 --> 20:10.009
stamps, all this stuff that that young man was 
really thinking ahead.

20:10.029 --> 20:13.092
Mason's brother was a Marine and he died of cancer. 
He was in the 13th Marines in Brest, but anyhow, he

20:13.112 --> 20:18.718
died of cancer and I went out to see him there in the 
yard. What about, I have another question, and

20:20.400 --> 20:23.623
that is, When you were at A&M, did you think that you 
might want to be in the military as a career? I

20:31.263 --> 20:36.130
didn't become a sergeant until in my junior year. 
Not that I wasn't on the military, but I guess maybe

20:38.373 --> 20:43.199
I didn't fit in. I never was a corporal, but I was 
made a sergeant in my junior year. And then finally

20:49.788 --> 20:51.771
I was made a second lieutenant in G Company, but I 
had to transfer. I swapped with a boy named Gamble

20:55.107 --> 20:59.037
and got back in B Company, because that's where I 
was raised. So I was a low-ranking second

20:59.057 --> 21:01.222
lieutenant in B Company. And I always liked the 
military. I never missed a drill. I never missed a

21:07.217 --> 21:08.380
guard mount. I never missed anything. But 
however, there were other people more proficient

21:10.381 --> 21:14.751
in the military art than I was. Of course, we had to 
take military science and tactics. We had to study

21:17.357 --> 21:23.731
the campaigns of Marengo, Napoleonic campaigns, 
and all of that, which I don't know whether they do

21:17.357 --> 21:23.731
that today. I want to say I was a shining star. Now, 
were you in a position of leadership in the Corps?

21:29.667 --> 21:30.268
Second lieutenant. No. Oh, okay. Low rank and 
second lieutenant in B Company. The lowest

21:33.270 --> 21:34.071
ranking. I had one higher ranking second 
lieutenant myself. That was it. But your

21:37.414 --> 21:40.617
leadership was with the Yale, Yale leadership. 
That's correct. See, anyhow, I guess maybe they

21:42.198 --> 21:44.700
made me a... But Dr. Zell did tell me when I 
graduated, he said, congratulations, I'm glad

21:45.221 --> 21:51.186
you're gone. That's what he said? I'm glad you're 
gone? That's right. Were you always considered a

21:56.500 --> 22:00.345
Hellraiser then? Considered, yes, in a way, but I 
was always within the lines. Of course, as a

22:05.651 --> 22:21.850
freshman, I was on a student labor role, and I 
worked down at the steam plant for 17 and a half

22:05.651 --> 22:21.850
cents an hour, and we'd unload the gondola one 
hour, And then fire the boiler the next hour. I well

22:25.881 --> 22:29.446
remember when I went down there to apply for the job 
at the steam plant. Of course, you had to clear with

22:30.167 --> 22:31.810
the main office. And this old man, Groupy, showed 
me how to fire a boiler. He asked me if I'd ever fired

22:37.538 --> 22:39.801
a Nolson. Well, there was a hole there about maybe 
24 inches long and maybe 12 inches wide. You're

22:46.291 --> 22:48.394
supposed to open this hole. and take your scoop and 
turn your shovel and spread the cinders across the

22:48.543 --> 22:54.312
coils. So he showed me how to do it one time and then 
next he had me do it again and I missed and he made me

22:56.055 --> 23:08.434
pick up all the coal and I did it and missed again the 
second time and finally I got the swing of turning

22:56.055 --> 23:08.434
my wrist to spread the coal. I also had a job putting 
the mail on the train. I got $10 a month for that. I

23:15.863 --> 23:28.119
put the mail on a northbound train that came from 
Houston going to Dallas along about midnight, and

23:15.863 --> 23:28.119
then the one going south going to Houston from 
Dallas at 3 o'clock in the morning. So along about

23:28.820 --> 23:34.067
quarter to 12, I'd leave my barracks and go down and 
get into the mail room. I had to pull the mail truck

23:34.087 --> 23:44.301
out to where the mail

23:34.087 --> 23:44.301
car stopped, and that was it, and then pull the mail 
back into the mail room So at the mail, the

23:44.686 --> 23:46.449
postmaster would get it. I got ten dollars a month 
for that and every time I missed the mail I was fined

23:47.230 --> 23:55.183
ten dollars and several times I didn't make any 
money just because I overslept.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.570
So it wasn't a very profitable job. It wasn't a very 
profitable job. Well in those days ten dollars

24:02.014 --> 24:05.479
went a long ways. Another thing I had also, I was an 
agent from the M.C. Lilly Company selling cap

24:11.150 --> 24:15.276
covers, and I'd blow everybody that had to have a 
cap cover. Made a little profit on that. What are

24:16.979 --> 24:18.021
cap covers? The cap cover, your military cap. Oh, 
okay, okay, the little, yeah, okay. Yeah. The

24:23.530 --> 24:25.293
little cover on top of your military hat. Yeah, and 
those funny little hats you had on. Sure, yeah,

24:26.775 --> 24:27.356
okay. So, the real... The real, I've been used to 
handling money and the first thing you know I was

24:32.915 --> 24:42.187
made chairman of the Thanksgiving Hop as a junior. 
And I organized these people, I got collections

24:43.669 --> 24:47.674
from profs and everything else. And financially 
it was a huge success. And I published a report Of

24:55.865 --> 24:58.210
course, we hit the professors and everybody else. 
And I had a report from each company how much and

24:58.671 --> 25:03.602
gave them a report on the expenditures and all like 
that. And they thought that was a great thing, but I

25:04.203 --> 25:11.478
didn't know anything about it because I'd had a 
little bookkeeping back in that cathedral school

25:04.203 --> 25:11.478
in Natchez. I just thought that was the proper 
thing to do to render a report and put it on the

25:15.845 --> 25:17.747
bulletin board. Well, I did the wrong thing, 
because every time somebody about finances came

25:17.767 --> 25:22.732
up, they wanted to appoint me chairman of that 
committee. Oh. So you got a lot of experience

25:24.294 --> 25:25.855
there. That's right. Anyhow, so that brings me to 
graduation. Well, I was happy to graduate. The

25:35.085 --> 25:39.629
Honorable James Ferguson, the governor of Texas, 
handed me my diploma. And I proceeded to Houston

25:41.011 --> 25:44.434
after that.

25:46.658 --> 25:52.244
That would be in 1915, and they had nobody to ever 
offer me any jobs. I have a question, though, about

25:52.544 --> 25:59.351
when you came to A&M, did you have any money to pay 
for it, or did you just find these jobs? No, my

25:59.452 --> 26:01.594
brother advanced me the money. Oh, good. My 
brother advanced me the money, and I didn't want to

26:02.695 --> 26:13.206
impose on him too much because he was married, so I 
got my other money by working. And when you

26:14.165 --> 26:19.432
graduated then in 1915, did you have some firm 
goals? Did you want to go in the military? Well, the

26:20.734 --> 26:43.243
thing about that, I went over there to the post 
office, and I thought I had a degree in

26:20.734 --> 26:43.243
agriculture, but in my mind what I did want to do, I 
had made a labor income report on the Harlem State

26:20.734 --> 26:43.243
Farm, and Mr. Blakely was a friend of mine, and I had 
in my mind if I could work at the Harlem Farms, work

26:43.493 --> 26:53.548
for the government a couple of years, then go to the 
Harlem Farms and bring in mechanical farming on a

26:43.493 --> 26:53.548
large scale. I learned a lot about farming. Then I 
wanted to get out on my own as a large scale

26:55.030 --> 27:02.802
mechanical farmer. Because just about that time, 
the hard part, people brought a tractor down to

27:03.220 --> 27:07.604
A&M. There was nothing but one of these machines 
that you level ass for with, and it had spikes in it.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.814
And they put a... Professor Gee was a professor. 
And they put a rail behind it, and they had a

27:20.356 --> 27:28.424
spike-toothed harrow and a disc harrow and a 
buster and so forth and so on. But anyhow, so... I go

27:31.992 --> 27:35.936
over there and take a look at the post office. On the 
other side, they wanted a second lieutenant from

27:35.956 --> 27:42.182
the Marine Corps, and I looked at that just 
slightly. My first experience with the Marine

27:42.262 --> 27:52.571
Corps was in Natchez, Mississippi, when the 
Mississippi came up the Mississippi River, and I

27:42.262 --> 27:52.571
saw the Marine Guard on there, and I thought their 
uniforms were beautiful, but I didn't know what it

27:42.262 --> 27:52.571
was. When was that? Do you remember when that was? 
What? When this first experience? Is this before

27:57.736 --> 27:59.518
you went to A&M or after? Okay, okay. I was just 
digging back a little bit. Okay, good. And I saw

28:03.872 --> 28:05.455
this Marine Guard on there. Okay, good. On the U.S. 
Mississippi. Came up the Mississippi River. But

28:09.681 --> 28:13.987
anyhow, the...

28:16.371 --> 28:22.139
But when you were at A&M, you weren't thinking 
about making a career out of the military then,

28:16.371 --> 28:22.139
were you? No, I wasn't. No, I was not. But anyhow, 
the...

28:32.472 --> 28:40.944
So I looked at the Department of Agriculture and I 
looked at the other, the second lieutenant of the

28:32.472 --> 28:40.944
Marine Corps, so I decided that maybe I'd try 
agriculture. So I put in an application for that

28:40.964 --> 28:56.387
and I was given a job with the

28:40.964 --> 28:56.387
U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of 
Plant Industry, which was cooperating with the

28:40.964 --> 28:56.387
state of Texas. in the cancer control, or citrus 
cancer control, and also a few of the plant

28:56.941 --> 29:05.750
diseases we were trying to control, pink boll one.

29:08.953 --> 29:18.542
So I took that job and I said, they asked me a 
question, how many languages I could speak, and I

29:08.953 --> 29:18.542
said I could understand Italian and speak a little 
of it. That's all I said, I didn't say I could read it

29:20.364 --> 29:26.610
or write it, which of course I was ashamed of, I 
should have learned to read it and write it. but

29:27.485 --> 29:30.832
they didn't speak Italian in my home after my 
grandmother died in 1904. But anyhow,

29:30.892 --> 29:43.418
so I finally got the job due to the fact that they had 
an Italian colony down at Dickinson in League

29:30.892 --> 29:43.418
City. and Alta Loma and Hitchcock, and the 
inspectors were having trouble getting over the

29:44.073 --> 29:55.171
program to them, so I went on down there as 
assistant to one of the inspectors. Well, I did a

29:55.191 --> 29:58.476
good job as assistant, so they made me the 
inspector. I worked at that job down there for over

29:59.278 --> 30:03.104
a year, and I was about ready to be transferred. My 
salary was $150 a month, and by that time I had

30:03.124 --> 30:08.713
bought a Ford, and I was paying my brother back with 
a great advance on my education and then war was

30:09.672 --> 30:26.897
declared and in my brother's office in Houston the 
Marine recruiting office was on that same floor.

30:28.659 --> 30:34.988
So one day the recruiting officer said to me he knew 
he had met me over at the press club and I was with

30:35.491 --> 30:40.838
Bruce Mansfield, who was the son of Congressman 
Mansfield, and Mansfield was teaching

30:35.491 --> 30:40.838
descriptive geometry at A&M. He was down there for 
the summer. So, McCauley, well, anyhow, the war

30:44.143 --> 30:50.692
was declared, and I decided my own self. I was told I 
had an exemption because we needed cotton to make

30:51.173 --> 31:02.629
gunpowder with and so forth and so on, but I had well 
remembered that what I wanted to do, so...

31:03.436 --> 31:12.705
McCauley got us up to his office and said that we 
could be 2nd Lieutenant of the Marine Corps

31:03.436 --> 31:12.705
provided we'd go over to New Orleans and take the 
examination. That our certification as to our

31:13.645 --> 31:22.153
education qualification would be substantiated 
by our degrees from Texas A&M College. So I

31:22.934 --> 31:25.456
proceeded to New Orleans, Louisiana. Bruce 
Mansfield and I went before a board and

31:34.165 --> 31:45.657
passed the board and passed the physical and 
everything and was made a second lieutenant and

31:34.165 --> 31:45.657
before we were told to return home and in three days 
time we had proceed orders. I had been in a little

31:47.319 --> 31:57.028
bit of disfavor at A&M about a matter that was 
questionable and I was told to stay off the campus.

31:57.509 --> 31:58.450
What matter was that? The distribution of it. a 
paper called the court-martial put out by the

32:02.617 --> 32:07.123
class of 16. I had distributed them and of course, 
being a yellow leader, everybody knew me and of

32:07.284 --> 32:14.875
course I was on report and that night at the dance. 
What did this paper say? Well, it was like the rip

32:17.338 --> 32:22.225
saw that they put out at the University of 
Virginia. It said that Dr. Brazell's wife was

32:22.245 --> 32:28.354
going to examine the lingerie of all the girls 
before they go to the dance. And the fictitious

32:29.009 --> 32:41.408
names of the editors were YMCA people and 
goody-goody boys like Penrose Metcalf and Whitey

32:29.009 --> 32:41.408
Moffat and all of that. And then they called, they 
said something about, they called Dean Kyle,

32:41.468 --> 32:48.859
Edward Jackass Kyle, all in fun. And

32:49.680 --> 32:57.632
so that night I was dancing, I was the sheriff of... 
We said, Brad, this guy tapped me on the shoulder

32:58.321 --> 33:03.547
and says, I got a warrant for your arrest for 
criminal libel. So I turned around and I said, what

33:04.789 --> 33:06.831
do I do next? And by that time, a fellow by the name of 
Meredith James, whose father had a drug store in

33:06.851 --> 33:12.478
Bryan, he went to my barn. Another fellow from out 
west Texas by the name of L.P. Jones, he went to my

33:12.538 --> 33:16.622
barn. So I went back on my territory, intended to my 
business. So I knew... When war was declared, I

33:25.574 --> 33:33.925
knew whether to come to A&M College because I was 
told to stay off the campus. So I knew whether to

33:33.945 --> 33:51.869
come back up there and ask for a application to be 
commissioned in the Army, but I'd always had a

33:33.945 --> 33:51.869
tender heart for the Marine Corps because I loved 
those blues and I'd read about the Marines at

33:33.945 --> 33:51.869
Santiago and I'd already read about the Marine 
history and all like that, so it didn't mean

33:33.945 --> 33:51.869
anything. So... So that's why you went in the 
Marines, though, instead of the Army? I went to

33:56.455 --> 33:58.779
Marine Corps first, I had a love for the Marines. As 
a child, I saw all those people coming up from

33:58.839 --> 34:03.446
Mississippi River, the Marine Guard, you know. I 
got pictures of Mississippi right down in there

34:04.227 --> 34:06.691
right now. Anyhow. There's another thing that I 
wanted to ask you about the Corps. And I was

34:11.177 --> 34:15.544
wondering what ways do you think the Corps helped 
you? The Corps helped me. If I hadn't been a second

34:17.200 --> 34:20.665
lieutenant in the Marine Corps, I never could 
have. I mean, in A&M, I never could have made it in

34:20.806 --> 34:24.591
the Marine Corps. Oh, why do you say that? Because 
the things I learned at Texas A&M College,

34:25.733 --> 34:42.477
continual close order drill, continual 
discipline, continual guard mount, the honor

34:25.733 --> 34:42.477
system, and the comradeship, Organization, 
leadership, that you learned at A&M College.

34:48.031 --> 34:51.274
Although I wasn't such a big crowd, but I realized 
it all had to be. That's what makes a good leader.

34:55.599 --> 34:58.142
And practically all, I wasn't the only Aggie. 
There were 22 of us went in the Marine Corps during

34:58.883 --> 35:02.907
that time, 22 Aggies. And all of us had been in the 
Corps. Not like today, you don't have to be in the

35:05.963 --> 35:09.429
Corps, but everybody had been in the Corps. Had to 
be in the Corps because under the Smith-Lever Act,

35:10.150 --> 35:18.003
that's what they were supposed to seek, military 
science and tactics and agriculture and

35:10.150 --> 35:18.003
engineering art. Well, I see right now they're 
bacheloring the act because they're not doing

35:18.023 --> 35:21.148
that. Everybody ought to have two years of 
military service.

35:26.898 --> 35:31.305
Was there any way, do you think, that the Corps 
might not have helped you, might have hindered

35:26.898 --> 35:31.305
you? Never. Never will I think that. I was so proud 
to be a cadet at A&M College and when they gave me

35:34.815 --> 35:46.869
that sword and gave me that parchment the second 
lieutenant was hanging around, I was just so

35:34.815 --> 35:46.869
grateful I felt proud of even being a second 
lieutenant. I was proud of being a sergeant. Was

35:49.832 --> 35:52.195
there anything about the Corps that you did not 
like? Not a thing. Never. I loved the leadership. I

35:57.321 --> 35:59.123
admired all those people. And after civil life, 
after all that, I can see back now what it did. And

36:05.323 --> 36:13.294
when I see the people of A&M College have 
accomplished something, they've always had

36:05.323 --> 36:13.294
training and leadership which started at Texas 
A&M College. So, in other words, you think the

36:13.314 --> 36:15.838
Corps helped you become a general? You bet, I do. I 
certainly do. Because it taught you to be a leader?

36:21.747 --> 36:22.368
I think it did. I know it did. Okay, okay, fine. See, 
I know it did. Mm-hmm. And, uh... The things I

36:27.925 --> 36:33.554
learned at A&M College about defense, I lived in a 
tent two years. Well, it wasn't, that wasn't, it

36:34.215 --> 36:36.519
was tough. I said to somebody, I lived in a tent two 
years, and he said, well, you're setting him once

36:36.599 --> 36:41.366
more on education, my bad. Well, either he was that 
or else. It was very unhandy. My headquarters was

36:45.032 --> 36:48.498
up at Austin Hall, and I lived in tent 12. It was 12 
places from the flagpole. And when you had guard

36:52.725 --> 36:54.928
mount, you had to go all the way up. Dawson Hall, the 
details started there, instead of starting out in

36:55.651 --> 37:00.115
front of the main building, it started there. But 
with all the hardships, all that discipline, I

37:00.576 --> 37:07.643
think in the Act of Life, the things you have to do, 
there's no easy way. You take things step by step.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.287
Same way with responsibility. You start with a 
little responsibility, and you come with another

37:12.307 --> 37:17.753
and another. Now... Now there's something else 
I'd like to ask you. You must have dealt with a lot of

37:22.437 --> 37:25.000
officers during your career that were either from 
Annapolis or from ROTC? I'll get to that. Okay,

37:32.881 --> 37:33.542
fine. All right, now wait a minute. Okay. We were 
talking about... We were talking about the Corps.

37:38.070 --> 37:39.793
We were talking about getting in the Marine Corps. 
Yeah. All right, well, when I had been home three

37:40.394 --> 37:46.465
days and I received receipt orders... Mm-hmm. And 
I decided to go up to Texas A&M to tell my favorite

37:46.748 --> 38:06.854
professors goodbye, and the sergeants in the 
commandant's office, Sergeant Kenny, Sergeant

37:46.748 --> 38:06.854
Smart, and Sergeant Kenny Smart, and Holland, 
called him Satch, who incidentally had a son who

37:46.748 --> 38:06.854
graduated at West Point. So when I arrived there, a 
young officer, I can't call his name right now, who

38:09.177 --> 38:15.726
was assistant commandant, heard me back there 
talking to Sergeant Kenny and said to me, he says,

38:16.162 --> 38:20.828
your name Baraka? Yes. I said, well, did you get 
that letter? I said, yes, I got that letter. I was

38:26.475 --> 38:28.237
staying off this campus. Yes, I did. He says, but I 
says to him, Lieutenant, you don't know who you're

38:29.619 --> 38:35.206
talking to. By that time, I told him, I says, you are 
talking to Second Lieutenant Victor A. Baraka,

38:36.308 --> 38:44.498
United States Marine Corps. on the proceed 
orders. I said, this is a land grant scholar and an

38:47.804 --> 38:56.737
instrumentality of the government and the Marine 
Corps and an instrumentality of the government

38:47.804 --> 38:56.737
and so you can't put me off this campus. So he said, 
let me see your orders. So I showed him my orders and

38:59.762 --> 39:04.789
when he saw that proceed, he knew that I was on duty 
to go and pay then. He reached out his hand and

39:05.350 --> 39:08.755
congratulated me and said, I hope you get back 
alive. That's true. All right. Now we're going to

39:15.258 --> 39:17.541
get... So that was 1917, as soon as America went 
into the war. That's correct. Okay. All right.

39:24.048 --> 39:38.905
Now...

39:24.048 --> 39:38.905
What did I do with that?

39:38.925 --> 39:44.151
Now, I'll give you briefly... Of course, I've got 
some pictures here. I'm going to give you a copy of

39:46.628 --> 39:48.150
this. Okay, good. I said I commissioned second 
lieutenant in the Marine Corps, April 1970, and he

39:49.812 --> 39:57.903
completed the basic course, Marine Corps School, 
Quantico, Virginia.

40:00.907 --> 40:01.267
Evidence. Oh, really? Nice picture. These are the 
great-greats of the Marine Corps.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.663
So this is officer training school here? That's 
right. Quantico, Virginia, 1917. Ain't no bull

40:16.688 --> 40:19.031
here. August. Yeah, I am right there. See me? Yeah. 
There's Brailford, one of the first Marines to get

40:23.718 --> 40:26.081
killed. There's Gilfillan from up at Tyler. 
Former commandants of the Marine Corps are all in

40:28.605 --> 40:31.609
this group. Cates and them and all that.

40:42.063 --> 40:42.564
It is.

40:45.749 --> 40:46.290
That's a nice picture. There's the Honorable, 
there's Drexel Biddle. We don't mean much to you,

40:48.414 --> 40:52.861
but there's a family of Bailey Banks and Biddle in 
Philadelphia. He stayed on active in the Marine

40:52.881 --> 40:54.825
Corps for free. Biddle. I know Biddle. He taught 
us, he taught us. I know the Biddle family. You do.

41:00.795 --> 41:05.623
He taught us the bayonet, the quake, the boxing. In 
the Marine Corps, we had to run boxing. I'll tell

41:09.033 --> 41:10.214
you about that. Tell me about that. Tell me about 
your basic training back in 1917. All right, we'll

41:14.581 --> 41:21.070
go through it right quick.

41:21.090 --> 41:34.290
The basic training in 19, as I showed you, in this 
officer battalion here,

41:21.090 --> 41:34.290
was broken down into companies A, B, C, and D, and I 
happened to be in B company again. It was commanded

41:34.310 --> 41:36.673
by... a son of a great-grand-nephew of General 
Robert E. Lee. He was a very kind man. We were issued

41:46.825 --> 42:00.106
782 equipment, and we were barracks all together, 
organizing companies, and we trained very hard.

42:00.787 --> 42:03.831
We all had classroom in the mornings. We had Then we 
had drill all day and half the night. In that school

42:08.864 --> 42:19.497
we learned to do topography and I often thought 
when I had to take civil engineering one and two as a

42:08.864 --> 42:19.497
bug under the A&M, God, what the hell I ever needed 
that for. But I knew I needed it later on at A&M when I

42:19.517 --> 42:26.546
took water conservation and making terraces. I 
always did come in handy for me making contour maps

42:27.106 --> 42:32.513
because all they gave us was a plane table and a 
compass. We had all kinds of

42:34.467 --> 42:42.496
real forced marches. We had plenty of experience 
in the field. We had banded fighting. We had

42:49.884 --> 42:50.825
boxing. And I well remember that old man Biddle, 
with his marches out, and with right face around

43:00.944 --> 43:04.728
that, that was your opponent, all that on gloves. 
And he said you had to learn to box before you could

43:05.529 --> 43:09.634
use a bayonet. So he said, you got a bayonet, you hit 
a guy in the chest with a bayonet, you slash him over

43:09.654 --> 43:27.795
the head with your, I mean, with the butt of your 
rifle, butt him up in the breast, you slash him over

43:09.654 --> 43:27.795
the head with your rifle, and if your rifle breaks, 
you kick him in the nuts, or the cards, he said. He

43:28.703 --> 43:35.273
also showed us how to use a knife and quake, and in 
those days, judo had just started. That was all

43:36.434 --> 43:38.317
part of our training. As I say, we learned signal 
work, semaphore, the Morse code, and we had all

43:39.219 --> 43:58.407
kinds of close order drills every day and tactics 
and problems and so forth and so on, besides

43:39.219 --> 43:58.407
building a trench city where the, Butler Stadium 
is there in Quantico, Virginia today. The

44:03.081 --> 44:07.968
termination of that school, I— Did you think it was 
a good school? I mean, did you think you learned a

44:07.988 --> 44:09.890
lot? Did you learn a lot? Sure learned a lot. Did 
they prepare you? I had learned to fire the range at

44:13.115 --> 44:16.980
A&M College, too. And when they took me to the rifle 
range, of course I wasn't so hot, but the second day

44:17.000 --> 44:22.588
I was on the line, Sergeant grabbed me and he says, 
the way you're going, you're not going to make

44:22.838 --> 44:26.103
exploits. We want our officers to be exploits. So I 
snapped in for three or four days there, and he put

44:28.166 --> 44:32.833
me on the line, and I made exploits. This is all at 
Quantico, Virginia, the officer school. How many

44:38.141 --> 44:40.305
Aggies were there in your class? About 22. About 22 
Aggies. Out of how many, about 100? Were there

44:47.876 --> 44:49.218
about 100 there? No, there wasn't any 100 there. 
How many were there? I

44:52.117 --> 44:59.387
would say there were about 12 of us in that class. 
These other people, with their training, they

45:00.048 --> 45:04.615
didn't go to officer school. Kids who had 
graduated in 1917, as you recall, were in ROTC. So

45:10.944 --> 45:21.178
they took officers from the class of 15, 16, and the 
people in 17 had the preference because they were

45:10.944 --> 45:21.178
already in ROTC. And whatever service they went 
in, they assigned them to active duty

45:21.158 --> 45:25.085
immediately. I see. I see. See? But in my school, 
there'd been people in ROTC, too. I showed you that

45:29.754 --> 45:31.538
picture of those people. But anyhow, I

45:32.239 --> 45:40.635
was assigned a duty at... Charleston Navy Yard, I 
didn't get it in there, but for transportation to

45:42.472 --> 45:48.279
the West Indies. I served as a big part of the war in 
the West Indies. Virgin Islands, March 1918.

45:55.248 --> 45:57.711
There you go. You can take this. Either one of you 
can take this. All right.

46:07.531 --> 46:08.452
Now what did you do there? You were the 
post-treasurer? I was disappointed, of course,

46:10.414 --> 46:19.845
that I didn't get overseas, but the Marine Corps 
had so many stations and the Army didn't want too

46:10.414 --> 46:19.845
many Marines overseas. We didn't have but two 
regiments, 15th and 6th, and the 13th back at Brest

46:19.985 --> 46:24.951
on the General's button. They didn't want any in 
the lines, but Marines did have three or four

46:24.971 --> 46:32.880
generals commanding Army divisions, which was 
General Lejeune and others. So you were upset that

46:34.244 --> 46:38.530
you couldn't go and fight against Germany? No. But 
I went to West Indies. And in the West Indies, you

46:41.894 --> 46:52.868
know, we were fighting bandits from Haiti and San 
Domingo and all those places, and this command

46:41.894 --> 46:52.868
here was part of it. I don't understand, though. 
Tell me, what do you mean you were fighting

46:54.370 --> 46:56.793
bandits? You were keeping the peace? Yeah, in 
Haiti and San Domingo. Okay. You see, this was all

47:01.019 --> 47:03.542
under the...
