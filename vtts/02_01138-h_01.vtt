WEBVTT

00:06.342 --> 00:14.434
Anyway, I think we ought to continue talking about 
your early childhood a little bit more. I really

00:14.454 --> 00:15.916
do. Again, the things that... Well, you have that 
and about the Jew peddler coming through. I have

00:24.087 --> 00:26.010
those things, yes. We've gotten a lot of the 
isolated things, and I want to run things together

00:26.070 --> 00:31.658
now. Yeah. Because now's really the time. I'm 
going to transcribe verbatim from every take and

00:34.036 --> 00:38.925
then cut and paste and put it together. Yeah, 
you've got that. I've got that story. And you've

00:41.870 --> 00:47.120
got the one about carrying the mail across the 
river horseback. Got one about the old horse, us

00:47.140 --> 00:51.247
feeding her and killing her. Right. Now, which one 
was that? Oh, Cousy. Feeding her and killing her? I

00:56.774 --> 00:57.555
don't think we have that. Yeah. Yes, you do, too. 
I've got that one. We fed her oats in a tub full of

00:59.837 --> 01:04.802
oats. And me and the little Mexican boy, Jesus, 
carried the oats in gallon buckets and filled a tub

01:04.822 --> 01:14.231
full up and was going to fatten her overnight. And 
we did. She swelled up as big as two horses. I bet she

01:17.574 --> 01:18.515
did. Yes, she did. And I know you have that one. OK. 
And I just don't really know. Well, I'm just

01:27.668 --> 01:32.779
thinking, you know, like today you were talking 
about the values that you feel are missing. And I

01:33.360 --> 01:36.126
guess you feel they're existent in the Texas Hill 
Country. Well, they are more so than in a lot of

01:36.728 --> 01:41.638
other places in this country. They are, as far as 
old talks is concerned. I think that's important

01:44.817 --> 01:46.559
to say. I mean, you know, you came from a grassroots 
family. When you got here, there wasn't much grass

01:51.728 --> 01:54.652
yet. No, I didn't. I mean, you really...

01:55.614 --> 02:01.423
You scrapped a living on a frontier. As you taught 
those kids to read today, you told them what a

02:02.244 --> 02:05.810
frontier was. And... You've never known really 
any other life as far as your childhood goes.

02:14.929 --> 02:15.971
That's so right. I've got the stories of Uncle 
Jesse and things like that. And you've got the

02:20.558 --> 02:24.265
story of Uncle Jesse and Donald's got a wooden leg. 
Yeah. Donald's got a meat skin. Laid away degrees

02:27.410 --> 02:31.116
that mother laid twice a day. And he'd stomp that 
wooden leg at me, and man, I'd just cut a beeline out

02:31.501 --> 02:36.448
to my mama. It'd just scare me to death. You know, it 
was taken off along about here, and it fastened on.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.509
No, I guess it didn't, because he could bend his 
knees. It was all the way under his knee, and it had

02:50.569 --> 02:54.956
to come down here. It had to a fork like that, and 
they come together. And it was just a wooden, he

02:59.568 --> 03:03.714
didn't have wooden foot, it was just a wooden 
stick. And he'd stomp that thing at me, and man, I

03:05.036 --> 03:09.242
would run. Oh, I bet. And I know you've got my poem, 
the first one he ever taught me. I think I do. I've

03:16.953 --> 03:22.221
got a secret, just be free, Robin and I in the sweet 
chubby tweed. But Wobby knows it best. I believe

03:25.180 --> 03:26.682
you've got that one. I do have that one. All right. 
And then the next one that he taught me, and it's a

03:29.606 --> 03:35.054
long one. The buttercups are coming in the scarlet 
columbine, and in the sunny meadows the

03:35.074 --> 03:42.144
dandelions shine. Just as many days as your salt 
cans can hold, the Lord God made them all. The

03:49.210 --> 04:01.524
little bird flew over and oh how sweet they sang to 
tell the happy children that once again this

03:49.210 --> 04:01.524
spring the graving grass comes creeping so soft 
beneath the feet. The frogs began to ripple, a

04:01.544 --> 04:08.071
music tearing sweet. Now I learned that before I 
started school from Uncle Jesse. What are

04:12.836 --> 04:14.678
children missing today? poetry they're missing 
the love of poetry and uncle jesse taught me all of

04:15.029 --> 04:31.300
that and where did uncle jesse learn this i mean he 
was a veteran of the civil war uncle jesse uh

04:31.735 --> 04:38.366
Johnson had a good education, and he got it from 
McGuffey's Readers. McGuffey's Readers. That's

04:40.088 --> 04:40.870
right. And he'd get those things out. Every story 
in McGuffey's Reader had a moral to it. It had a

04:48.161 --> 04:51.707
principle, and it taught you something. And he'd 
sit me down, and he'd say, now you listen. All

04:55.580 --> 05:06.675
right, you saw today with these children that I had 
in this room, and the last one that came, they do not

04:55.580 --> 05:06.675
understand what the word listen means. And I had to 
repeat to that little girl three times. I said,

05:11.762 --> 05:14.726
well, honey, how many boxes do you see on that 
shelf? One. Well, what did I tell you? Get the

05:18.351 --> 05:19.954
cookie out of the box. I said, well, where is the 
box? Mm-hmm. Well, it's here. I said, now do you

05:23.658 --> 05:25.440
know what to do? Yeah. She said, get the cookie. I 
said, yes. They never listen. They do not

05:32.746 --> 05:43.195
understand that there is one thing to do but have 
their eyes glued on that idiot boxer called TV.

05:43.215 --> 05:43.495
That's right. And there's no morals being taught 
on television these days. But there's anything

05:45.937 --> 05:48.500
but morals on television. Exactly right. I think 
that's right. They were missing the boat. Well,

05:51.908 --> 05:55.355
when you grew up, you had literature in your home, 
as you said. You also had a mother that wrote songs.

05:58.280 --> 05:58.921
Yes, she did. She had beautiful songs. And I hope 
that we can take some of those and put them into

06:00.364 --> 06:04.993
print. I hope someday that somebody will pick them 
up. Well, I know somebody that will pick them up and

06:08.840 --> 06:12.888
do an album with them if you're interested. If they 
were interested. Worth it. They're worth it. I

06:17.266 --> 06:21.771
would love to see them maybe before we go, if we can 
find them or something like that. And the thing

06:21.872 --> 06:30.122
that most children are missing today is that 
companionship of older people. Now, I didn't miss

06:31.344 --> 06:44.781
out on a thing in the world for companionship of 
elderly people because I was the oldest

06:31.344 --> 06:44.781
granddaughter in the Johnson family. in the 
Bunton family, in the Chapman family, and in the

06:45.098 --> 06:49.703
Cox. See, my grandmother, Chapman, was a Cox 
before, but no relation to the Cox I married. And

06:56.952 --> 07:00.295
the oldest in the Cox family. Well, I had all the 
attention that

07:00.315 --> 07:06.382
could be given a little girl. But for the same 
token, I had an inferiority complex that wouldn't

07:08.445 --> 07:14.852
quit. very bad why was that um first that's 
cross-eyed second you know they just didn't

07:15.355 --> 07:39.388
wasn't anything or they didn't think could ever be 
done about it i was about as broad as i was long and i

07:15.355 --> 07:39.388
my hair wasn't Well, it had a wave in it, but my 
mother plaited it so tight that I couldn't bat my

07:39.807 --> 07:45.436
eyes. And those cross eyes sitting towards 
Joneses. And me as fat as a little pig. And long

07:54.170 --> 07:56.093
dresses. I can see those things, and they just make 
me so mad because they come to my sheet tops.

08:01.181 --> 08:01.541
Really? But I had to wear them. Yeah. And I had big 
bows in my hair, and I always had a sash, and I hated

08:04.394 --> 08:10.062
those sashes. We're talking about, because you 
were born in 1905,

08:10.803 --> 08:16.811
right? And so here in Texas in 1905, you were 
wearing your long dresses, you were wearing your

08:17.632 --> 08:27.786
pigtails, and you were living without the... The 
fancy city life that everybody else in the country

08:28.846 --> 08:33.131
was trying to aspire to have. That's right. I can 
remember just as well as it is yesterday when I had

08:34.233 --> 08:40.060
my first pair of patent leather slippers. Yeah. I 
was seven years old, and I just thought I was

08:41.102 --> 08:44.927
uptown. Right. And I was. Sure. And they were 
called Mary Janes. Really? Put out by Buster

08:50.454 --> 08:51.976
Brown. Oh, yes. Good old Buster Brown. Buster 
Brown shoes. And then the next pair of pretty shoes

08:56.260 --> 09:05.809
that I had, I bought from a Jew store here in Johnson 
City, and his name was Max Mellinger. Max

09:06.149 --> 09:07.911
Mellinger. Uh-huh. And they were really pretty. 
Uh-huh. They were black patent leather, and they

09:12.595 --> 09:21.263
had red kid's skin tops laced up. Oh, my, were they 
ever pretty. And I had, well, we called it a

09:24.962 --> 09:30.953
bearskin coat, but it wasn't. It was an imitation 
fur, and it was red. Uh-huh. And by then, I'd had my

09:37.264 --> 09:43.616
eyes straightened. Uh-huh. And I'd kind of 
trimmed up. And that was seven, about seven? I

09:49.732 --> 09:55.257
guess I must have been, oh, I had my eyes 
straightened when I was 10. So I was about 10 years

09:55.337 --> 09:57.399
old. And I had slammed down to where I was at least I 
could get through the door. And at school, they'd

10:03.405 --> 10:08.069
call me Donna because that's fat and all that kind 
of stuff. But anyway, I was so proud of that little

10:08.169 --> 10:12.613
red-skinned, Bare skin coat. Oh, I was so proud. 
Well, we'd had one once before, but it was a

10:16.371 --> 10:23.220
chinchilla effect that we'd bought from a peddler 
and it came through. But this one was bought from

10:23.700 --> 10:26.804
Max Mellinger here. And it's right where, his 
store is right where the old theater is now. Oh.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.092
That's right. And it was really a nice store. And he 
had nice goods. And he was well thought of in the

10:38.098 --> 10:42.263
community and... Was your grandfather, was he 
here after your grandfather or before? After my

10:47.219 --> 10:49.282
grandfather came here. Oh, okay. They were good 
friends. They were. I thought they might be. Yeah,

10:52.187 --> 10:53.109
they were. That is natural. Yes, I know. I'll tell 
you, you can't, you might separate them, but you

10:57.516 --> 11:04.147
can't, you might separate them in distance. But 
not, they'll find each other. They do. I know. Not

11:08.264 --> 11:14.011
only in that way, but financially in every other 
way, if it's needed. Right, that's true. If it's

11:16.194 --> 11:21.480
needed, that's part of their living, that's part 
of their life, that's part of their bringing up.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.221
Tradition, right. You bet it is. You said you 
didn't find out that your grandfather was Jewish

11:24.524 --> 11:30.031
until you were a grown woman. A grown woman, right, 
okay. And you didn't really know what that was

11:33.442 --> 11:36.346
about at all, did you? No, I didn't even know. But I 
knew why, that he would tell me about this

11:37.428 --> 11:45.060
compulsory military training. In Europe, right, 
in Germany? In Germany, and why he didn't want it.

11:51.329 --> 11:58.200
And he also told me when I was a girl, well, it was 
before World War I, He said, the one we had better be

11:58.687 --> 12:03.932
watching out for is Japan. He'd never say Japan. 
He'd always say Japan. He says, they're going to

12:08.837 --> 12:10.919
sneak around. They're sneakers. They're going to 
get you. And they're going to find us asleep. And

12:15.624 --> 12:16.905
they're going to hurt us. And he saw a war pending? 
Yes, he did. And he kept telling us that. While I was

12:22.530 --> 12:26.314
in high school, And I thought, well, Grandpa just 
has the awfulest feeling. I wonder why. And he came

12:33.881 --> 12:37.285
back and he said, I'll tell you something else. He 
said, well, my daddy was called up for World War I.

12:46.616 --> 12:49.920
But peace was signed before he had to go. But 
anyway, he was called up into the service. And so

12:53.465 --> 12:56.368
was Kitty Clyde's father, all of them. And my 
grandfather told them, he says, you may whip the

12:56.905 --> 13:04.291
Germans down, but they'll come back. You may think 
you've got them whipped, but they'll come back.

13:09.996 --> 13:14.860
And when they do, they will be against you. You're 
going to feed them, you're going to clothe them,

13:14.880 --> 13:22.507
and you're going to help them everywhere in the 
world to establish their government. And they're

13:22.847 --> 13:26.170
going to turn on you, and when they do, It's going to 
hurt you. Really? So it's sort of a folk wisdom of

13:30.251 --> 13:35.517
world politics that you grew up with. That I 
actually grew up with and had no newspapers, no

13:35.537 --> 13:40.642
nothing. My grandfather was a well-read man and a 
man of few words in public. My grandmother talked

13:53.335 --> 13:56.038
for the family. But my grandfather had very little 
to say. And where did his grandmother, I know

13:58.881 --> 14:03.247
that's his second wife, because his first wife 
died? No, his mother died. It was his mother that

14:05.871 --> 14:07.173
died. Mother that died, yeah. And he took this, he 
was a twin. And he and his twin sister, and her name

14:11.799 --> 14:14.763
was Clyde. That's where my mother got the name of 
Kitty Clyde. And he took this, well, yeah. They

14:25.651 --> 14:32.298
landed at Indiola and came on over to Houston. And 
my grandfather came from Houston to Brenham. And

14:36.943 --> 14:45.471
there was a German settlement that stopped in 
there, a bunch of the German immigrants that

14:36.943 --> 14:45.471
stopped in there. And my grandfather got a job 
working on the first railroad dump that was built

14:46.252 --> 14:54.440
from Brenham to Houston. Really? Now that, to me, 
is something. I look back and I say, yes. You know, I

15:01.446 --> 15:12.235
told you the night before last, I said, you can't 
find half a dozen Jews in the world that were

15:01.446 --> 15:12.235
pioneers, that would brave the wilderness first. 
They waited until it was settled, and then they

15:12.535 --> 15:15.498
came. My grandfather braved the wilderness. He 
did. Yeah, he did. He definitely did. Yeah. And

15:24.345 --> 15:25.206
then came... Well, anyway,

15:26.013 --> 15:48.104
grandmother died, and Aunt Beth and Uncle Alex was 
younger than Clyde and Jim. Jim was grandfather.

15:49.826 --> 15:52.650
James Henry was his name. Mm-hmm. they were 
younger than James and Henry and Clyde. But they

16:01.140 --> 16:03.663
made a home for these children. And grandfather 
married again. Your great-grandfather. My

16:08.468 --> 16:10.270
great-grandfather married again. But he changed 
his name from Chapman, S-H, or? S-H-A-P-M-A-W-N,

16:14.054 --> 16:18.799
C-H-A-P-M-A-N. Chapman. Chapman. He changed 
Chapman to Chapman. So he changed it. And he was

16:24.434 --> 16:32.685
afraid that he'd be tracked down, sent back, and 
put to work. Because he was so tall and so big for his

16:33.747 --> 16:36.690
age. And he was a grown man at 13. And naturally, he 
was scared to death. He was running scared. But

16:47.185 --> 16:52.011
then they moved to Round Rock. The entire family. 
Yeah. Moved over to Round Rock. And then

16:57.570 --> 17:05.097
grandfather met

16:57.570 --> 17:05.097
grandmother. This was in the 1800s. Yes. About 
1854. Well, grandfather came here before then.

17:16.428 --> 17:16.788
Let's see. Grandmother and grandfather. Let's 
see. 1854. Grandfather came here about 18 and got

17:21.472 --> 17:27.581
here in time for the Civil War. He was in the Civil 
War. I could look it up and I believe it must have

17:29.844 --> 17:40.600
been about 1850 because he got here in time to go to 
the Civil War and he fought in the Civil War.

17:40.620 --> 17:43.424
Grandfather Chapman fought in the Civil War. Yes, 
he sure did. Then he married Grandmother The same

17:51.155 --> 17:59.268
year that

17:51.155 --> 17:59.268
Grandpa Johnson married Grandma Bunton. Oh, 
really? That's like 1878. And then, I believe

18:04.917 --> 18:08.263
that's Kitty Clyde coming now. Oh, all right. 
Looks like somebody. Damn, I have no time. Excuse

18:12.289 --> 18:13.391
me. Uh-huh. But that's who it is. Okay. 1878? 
Mm-hmm. They married. Chapman. Chapman. And

18:20.417 --> 18:22.280
Uncle Buddy was born in 1880. That's right. 
Mm-hmm. Okay. And Aunt Mabel was born in 1882, and

18:24.523 --> 18:28.248
my mother was born in 1885. Okay. Right down that 
line. Sure. I'll have to see what she says. For

18:32.274 --> 18:32.795
sure. Well, I'll cut this off for a second. When

18:34.557 --> 18:54.213
he was president of the Republic of Texas, and he 
was offered the gift of the teletype

18:34.557 --> 18:54.213
to Texas. And for two years, Houston didn't 
answer. Houston didn't recognize it. So he sits

19:00.999 --> 19:10.090
down and he writes him a letter, and he says, I take 
that you don't care for my offer, and so I am

19:00.999 --> 19:10.090
withdrawing it. Well, had he taken that offer 
today, we would not be burdened with taxes, but we

19:10.650 --> 19:24.627
would be living off of the revenue that that... Of 
the telegraph. Of the telegraph that would be...

19:27.730 --> 19:29.413
brought in to Texas. They wanted to try it here? Is 
that what it was? They wanted to set up a system? To

19:34.463 --> 19:38.871
give it to Texas alone, the man alone, willed it to 
Texas. As a republic? Yes. Isn't that something?

19:42.879 --> 19:44.642
That is very true. That's amazing. That's another 
thing about you I've got to say. Because of when you

19:50.667 --> 20:02.158
were born and because of who your relatives were, 
whereas we talk about seeing so-and-so here or

19:50.667 --> 20:02.158
meeting this dignitary there, Your life, the way 
of your life, was what history was at that time and

20:02.138 --> 20:08.545
who these people were. And there just were not that 
many people in Texas as you realized when your

20:08.565 --> 20:17.015
grandparents were here that everybody was 
involved. That's right. In the building of this

20:18.036 --> 20:19.718
day. That's very true. And it's firsthand. It's 
firsthand. And right there, oh. Grandpa Baines

20:25.595 --> 20:30.960
borrowed money from Sam Houston. Uh-huh. And the 
letter is down there in the library. Uh-huh.

20:35.865 --> 20:41.951
Stating, thank you for loaning me the $150 that I am 
returning. Uh-huh. When you say there was a close

20:43.012 --> 20:47.116
bill of relation, there was. Yes. Well, all right. 
When I was a little girl... down here on the ranch,

20:51.599 --> 20:53.701
and we were driving. We sold our steers to Tom 
Stribling. And we had to take them to Marble Falls.

21:02.049 --> 21:03.571
That was the closest railroad. Well, you don't 
cross steers over a Colorado River. Now, that's

21:08.716 --> 21:09.797
for sure. Not then. All right. And we took them on 
over to Fairland to put them in on the train to take

21:12.720 --> 21:18.566
them across. We came back. And we stayed all night 
at Grandma Stribling's house over here at Round

21:21.704 --> 21:25.953
Mountain. Now that's horseback riding. That's 
not trailer horse business like these trail rides

21:28.418 --> 21:34.470
they have today. But that was sitting in the saddle 
all day long and come back that far. And we went

21:39.240 --> 21:43.088
to... And that's driving how many head of cattle? 
Well, altogether, we had 200 and I believe it was

21:43.321 --> 21:47.857
275. Well, we're supposed to have had 290, but we 
lost that many in the... cedar brakes from here

21:53.547 --> 22:14.728
there now that's no joke oh sure and so that's then 
when we got them on then we had to come back well we

21:53.547 --> 22:14.728
went through these pastures and that's the reason 
every one of us had to know every earmark and cattle

21:53.547 --> 22:14.728
brand in this country and it was just as automatic 
as Yes, it was a way of life. And we knew what that was

22:16.791 --> 22:18.693
branded. We knew what the earmark was. And we knew 
whether it belonged in our herd or not. Like

22:23.220 --> 22:25.443
license plates from different states. 
Absolutely. It's exactly like license plates

22:25.703 --> 22:28.667
from different states. But you knew it. Yeah. And 
you would know whether it belonged in your herd or

22:30.049 --> 22:33.133
not. Right. So we brought these. Well, we didn't 
get them all. I'll never forget that. Tom liked

22:37.880 --> 22:39.001
that a fit. But we didn't get them all. We didn't get 
but 15. Where the other four got to, I... I don't

22:44.088 --> 22:50.397
know, but we brought back 15 and they went in the 
next shipment. But grandma, scribbling that

22:50.417 --> 23:02.814
night, told us that we could sleep on the porch and 
on our saddle blanket and use our saddle for a

22:50.417 --> 23:02.814
pillow. I never will forget that. I'd never done 
anything like that, but I did it. I learned. That

23:07.780 --> 23:08.942
you could. Didn't smell very good, that saddle 
blanket. But it was all right. I bet it didn't. But

23:19.519 --> 23:24.486
before we went to bed, we asked her what she did when 
she was a little girl. Because she was from East

23:25.448 --> 23:27.111
Texas. She told us about going to Sunday school in a 
surrey. And we knew what a Surrey was, because

23:35.641 --> 23:40.487
Grandpa Johnson had one. And he'd take us to church 
in it. She said, Sam Houston and I would ride to

23:43.090 --> 23:50.398
Sunday School, Baptist Sunday School, in the same 
Surrey every Sunday. So I knew who Sam Houston was

23:51.399 --> 23:58.568
as a little girl. A little girl. I wasn't over 10 
years old, but I knew the history of Sam Houston

24:00.650 --> 24:04.635
from... Way back. From hearsay firsthand? Yeah, 
hearsay firsthand. And she told us what kind of a

24:09.601 --> 24:11.783
fellow he was. And she told us he didn't have much 
money. And as I read on in history and I found out, by

24:17.631 --> 24:25.200
the way, he didn't have enough to pay his 
announcing fee. Yeah. That's right. So it was paid

24:28.464 --> 24:31.789
for him. Well, that's no disgrace, but... There's 
been lots of poor people who made it good in history

24:35.564 --> 24:47.842
that came out wealthy, but

24:35.564 --> 24:47.842
there's no disgrace in being poor. But there's a 
disgrace in being ornery with it. That's

24:53.070 --> 25:02.264
what makes you a disgraceful person, being ornery 
by being poor and unclean. How poor you can be, you

25:02.344 --> 25:04.828
can still be clean. You can still think good. You 
can still have good principles. You can still be a

25:10.754 --> 25:16.201
man or a woman and look the whole world in the face. 
It's not where you live, it's how you live. It's how

25:20.227 --> 25:22.289
you meet your fellow man. It's lots of times, it's 
the kind word that you didn't say that day. Or it may

25:31.121 --> 25:32.503
be... The handshake that you wish you had grabbed 
and said, old boy, you did a good job. Or the pat on

25:38.095 --> 25:42.199
the back for the little one that fell aside on the 
race. You've run a good race, fella. You did your

25:44.983 --> 25:46.044
best. You didn't do it. It's the smile that the 
cripple might have needed who was sitting on the

25:49.588 --> 25:57.276
side of the road. waiting just a hand. But you 
didn't have time to stop and say, I'll help you.

26:05.149 --> 26:09.773
Maybe it was an old woman at the crossing of the 
street. Her feet were feeble. She's slow. Her

26:16.480 --> 26:18.922
eyesight was bad. But you were in a hurry. You 
didn't have time. Life meant nothing. But hurry,

26:27.040 --> 26:29.443
hurry, hurry. But to her, it may have been her last 
step had it been wrong. But you didn't have time.

26:38.294 --> 26:43.000
All of those things add up at the setting of the sun. 
It gives you a bit of heartache that you can never

26:43.560 --> 26:48.126
overcome.

26:51.731 --> 26:55.275
You just can't do it because that day is gone. It's 
gone. You can't recall it. It may never come your

27:02.203 --> 27:11.765
way again to have a chance to be kind.

27:11.885 --> 27:13.028
I'd rather be... Do you think these values are the 
values behind the people here in Johnson City? I

27:19.817 --> 27:20.218
do. I believe it's stronger than anything. As I 
have said a hundred times, and I'll say it again,

27:23.201 --> 27:31.490
this is a hard land to make a living in. You have to 
dig deeper. In other words, the worm is there, Mr.

27:41.020 --> 27:44.123
Rooster, but you've got to scratch deeper. So with 
people here, we know that we have to work harder to

27:45.164 --> 27:58.839
produce whatever we have. And I have often said 
that the oak tree in this country is typical of the

28:00.341 --> 28:09.070
people who live here. Because you can look at it, 
and it's bent from the snarls of the hard, cold

28:11.075 --> 28:35.916
winters, the dry summers, the hard hails, the 
winds, and the hardships that has hit it and bent it

28:11.075 --> 28:35.916
in different forms and fashions. Yet, you look at 
it, its roots are deep They're big, and they are

28:41.062 --> 28:55.921
grown out and out, and the limbs spread out and out, 
and they touch each way in the north, east, and

28:41.062 --> 28:55.921
south. That's exactly the way the people are in 
Blanco County, in Gillespie County. Their hands

29:01.868 --> 29:09.938
are outstretched to one another, and they help you 
when you need it. But you prove yourself first that

29:10.357 --> 29:15.467
you're worthy of that help. You find no soup lines 
here. You find no beggars on the street. They

29:23.081 --> 29:27.590
believe in an honest day's work for an honest 
dollar. And that's been our way of life. And our

29:32.193 --> 29:34.416
children are missing that value. Our children 
are, oh, I hope you don't have to work as hard as I

29:35.196 --> 29:39.041
did. I don't believe in that stuff. I think they 
should know that it doesn't hurt to pull a cotton

29:42.004 --> 29:55.780
sack and have a bullnettle whip you on your little 
bare legs and how they hurt and how hot it is. That's

29:56.821 --> 29:57.542
true. and boll weevil stung cotton and you'll pick 
them you'll go home and your blood will be dripping

29:58.315 --> 30:25.875
off of the end of your fingers from where the burrs 
have stuck it all day it wouldn't hurt these girls

29:58.315 --> 30:25.875
or boys to have a taste of that it wouldn't hurt them 
to have a taste of sitting in the saddle all day long

29:58.315 --> 30:25.875
and having a well we called it dried beef they call 
it jerky now but We'd take a hunk of dried beef and a

30:26.243 --> 30:35.512
cold biscuit, ride all day long, and eat that cold 
biscuit and jerky. Yes, you were tired when you got

30:37.875 --> 30:39.596
home. Your little seat was wore out. But you still 
had your night chores to do. You had a

30:45.702 --> 30:49.907
responsibility to do. I've driven cattle for help 
for my daddy. He'd say, well, I have three hands

30:53.210 --> 30:56.253
today. All right. A dollar a day for my horse and 
saddle. And thought I had good money. I was proud of

31:03.221 --> 31:04.242
it. I could buy school clothes with it.

31:10.529 --> 31:13.772
Life hasn't been easy, but I'm proud of it. I'm 
proud. It has made me a stronger person. I can look

31:16.816 --> 31:18.137
the whole...
