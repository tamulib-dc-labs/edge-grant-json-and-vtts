WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:18.459
This is May 16, and we are in the Hagler Center, and I 
have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Eddie

00:03.524 --> 00:18.459
Joe Davis, who is the exact title now? President of 
the Texas A&M Development Foundation. Texas A&M

00:23.784 --> 00:25.085
Foundation. Texas A&M Foundation. Okay, now 
we're going to cut this off and see if it works.

00:33.511 --> 00:48.685
Because someone in the future may listen to this or 
read it and not know your background, let's begin

00:33.511 --> 00:48.685
with your talking about where you grew up, family, 
what was the family income, where was it, and so

00:33.511 --> 00:48.685
forth. That was probably typical of most students 
coming to Texas A&M in the early 60s. And I grew up on

00:56.766 --> 01:11.863
a little farming ranch, 160 acres,

00:56.766 --> 01:11.863
inherited from my grandfather, who homesteaded 
with the objective of obtaining a quarter section

00:56.766 --> 01:11.863
for each child. And so my dad was the only one of 
about six or seven children who decided to stay and

01:13.045 --> 01:20.393
farm it. And he farmed all the rest of the quarter 
sections of the children who went to California

01:20.980 --> 01:26.167
and other places. This is where? Clay County. Went 
to high school or to all school in Henrietta,

01:32.176 --> 01:49.401
although it was a little place called the 
Stanfield Ranch, which was put together by

01:32.176 --> 01:49.401
Stanfield brothers and then broken up into 
parcels and sold in the late 1800s.

01:51.085 --> 02:09.567
they would have gone to school at Stanfield except 
they closed the one through eight grade school the

01:51.085 --> 02:09.567
year before I started school and then wrote a 
yellow dog school bus well what was between

01:51.085 --> 02:09.567
probably 23 and 25 miles a day to Henrietta to 
school Raised cotton, wheat, maize or milo were

02:09.935 --> 02:18.377
few cattle. Most of everything we had we produced 
our own food, milk, meat. still was in an

02:26.472 --> 02:39.366
environment sort of at the last of the end of an era, 
I guess, in that we would move around the little

02:26.472 --> 02:39.366
community and have hog killing in the fall, go from 
one house to the next. And we also, I guess we first

02:39.826 --> 02:50.758
got running water when I was about, oh, about first 
grade, something like that.

02:52.274 --> 02:56.740
The one-holer was near the chicken house, so it 
wouldn't smell, you understand. That is, the

02:58.582 --> 03:00.845
chicken took, you know, dominated. It was a pretty 
Spartan, sparse upbringing. They had two older

03:07.172 --> 03:14.181
brothers, both much older, 11 and 17 years older, 
so they were more like uncles and brothers. My

03:14.161 --> 03:23.070
theory was that my dad always wanted to have a hoe 
hand at home, so he spread them out, and that was the

03:14.161 --> 03:23.070
place that we began. You've told me in other 
conversations, I believe, about your father kind

03:24.432 --> 03:35.163
of assigning you a few acres that if you wanted to go 
to college, you work that and that income.

03:36.004 --> 03:38.346
Describe that arrangement. He and I basically 
farmed 160 plus, probably another 500

03:38.933 --> 03:50.022
cultivated, and we ran cows on about another 300 
acres. So we sharecropped and leased, and it kept

03:50.082 --> 03:55.035
us pretty busy. But the summer, I guess it was 
really the spring before my first year in college,

03:56.062 --> 04:06.471
and frankly, I didn't yet know where I was going to 
go at that point. It was a little different in those

04:06.651 --> 04:07.872
days. He pointed out to me a terrace and a fence row 
that if you took the circumference around that, it

04:09.093 --> 04:19.542
was about 13 acres. And he said, you, like you 
always do, help farm the whole thing. But whatever

04:25.492 --> 04:31.718
we make on that 13 acres of cotton is what you'll 
have to go to school on. Well, we made $100 an acre.

04:34.621 --> 04:41.008
So I had $1,300 to get me through my first year at 
A&M. And it was right on target. It was just about

04:43.891 --> 04:44.992
what it took. Plus, the other part of the story is we 
were sitting on the front porch shelling

04:45.072 --> 04:53.541
black-eyed peas probably around the 4th of July 
and my dad had gone to the mailbox it rained the

04:54.365 --> 05:22.583
night before so we couldn't work normal work so we 
were shelling peas he walks to the mailbox heads

04:54.365 --> 05:22.583
back up and I noticed a little extra spring in his 
step when he gets back to the front porch hands me an

04:54.365 --> 05:22.583
envelope in which I am told that I've received an 
opportunity award scholarship and that was the

04:54.365 --> 05:22.583
decision point frankly for i mean i had wanted to go 
to a m but didn't know that i could afford it where

05:23.238 --> 05:45.330
had you heard about a m and what primarily a couple 
of sources one my ag teacher was a a m graduate he was

05:23.238 --> 05:45.330
a non-traditional aggie in that he came to A&M 
after World War II as a veteran and had finished

05:45.648 --> 05:52.534
school. And so he wasn't, you know, he wasn't a part 
of the Corps. In fact, he really didn't know a lot

05:55.197 --> 05:57.939
about the Corps. Also a fellow named Penrose B. 
Metcalf, who you might have heard of. Penrose

06:04.765 --> 06:10.350
Metcalf was a great friend of people in the Future 
Farmers of America. I was a district, you know,

06:11.251 --> 06:15.655
local district regional and then state FFA 
officer in the FFA and Mr. Metcalf would haul us

06:15.635 --> 06:24.700
boys around try to teach us a little bit about what 
it was like to be in the grown-up world. And he

06:28.441 --> 06:33.806
talked fondly about us going to college, which we 
hadn't all thought about very much. And A&M was

06:34.787 --> 06:37.049
always on his mind. And then I had a fellow that was a 
class ahead of me in Henrietta that came here.

06:43.014 --> 06:50.281
Again, sort of similar background that I knew, not 
real well, named Eddie Shear. And Eddie was a

06:51.161 --> 06:53.864
contact for me down here. So those are the things. 
Now my dad always admired A&M because of the

06:55.105 --> 06:59.972
extension service. You know, they helped him with 
his bull worm problems and all of the other things

07:00.472 --> 07:09.325
that you endure and of course all of the ag 
community were familiar with A&M. So it was a

07:09.345 --> 07:10.346
natural link. Had you been to visit the campus? I 
came my senior year in high school and spent the

07:13.010 --> 07:20.345
night with some kids in the Corps. It wasn't an 
organized event in those days. Frankly, that was

07:24.815 --> 07:28.302
probably not a great motivator. I mean, it was 
okay, but the night I was here, it was dreary and

07:28.282 --> 07:44.678
rainy and dark and dank, and I wasn't sure that this 
was the kind of place for me, but I was, again,

07:28.282 --> 07:44.678
remained convinced that it was a good school and 
everybody thought highly of it. As far as you know,

07:44.939 --> 07:46.900
when did you apply? When did you start filling out 
some papers? It was probably late spring, my

07:48.862 --> 07:54.508
senior year in high school. i remember a friend of 
mine and i staying up and studying for quote the sat

07:54.488 --> 08:22.757
or act or whatever it was in those days you didn't 
have to have it to get in excuse me there wasn't a

07:54.488 --> 08:22.757
required score you had to take the test so i guess 
they were trying to see you know kind of where you

07:54.488 --> 08:22.757
were and then the the final decision was that that 
endowed or not endowed but the opportunity award

07:54.488 --> 08:22.757
how much was it 125

08:23.446 --> 08:26.912
I think it was $250 a year, you got $125 a semester. 
And then I had a valedictory scholarship, which

08:27.673 --> 08:35.786
allowed the tuition to be waived and my lab fees to 
be paid. So with all that combined, it was pretty

08:36.567 --> 08:42.036
substantial relative to the cost. So you were 
first in a class of how many? 33. 33. 11 boys and 22

08:45.501 --> 08:49.588
girls, I might add. Pretty good ratio. All right, 
as a sidelight, why that 2 to 1 male-female? I have

08:56.739 --> 08:58.361
no idea. Was there just a bigger dropout rate of the 
boys? Probably. You know, when you think about it,

09:03.208 --> 09:11.661
I mean, I had a first cousin who was very close to me 
who dropped out after his sophomore year, and it

09:03.208 --> 09:11.661
was pretty common in those days. uh... college was 
uh... sort of on the horizon not very many people

09:11.962 --> 09:33.801
thought about it did you have any idea before you 
got here what your major might be no uh... in fact

09:11.962 --> 09:33.801
uh... my mother and dad brought me down to after 
this arrival of the scholarship There was some

09:33.781 --> 09:42.077
information in there about you ought to come down 
before classes begin to meet with, you know, the

09:33.781 --> 09:42.077
college. And I did, I was thinking probably 
agriculture, but I didn't know what. And so we

09:47.348 --> 09:52.498
arranged to pass through College Station on the 
way to Galvin. a couple of days at Galveston,

09:52.478 --> 10:02.689
meeting some relatives, and stop off here and met 
with Dr. R.C. Potts, Dick Potts. And he was over in

10:05.371 --> 10:17.524
the old heap building, the one on, now I guess, I 
don't know what it's called, but it was the dairy

10:05.371 --> 10:17.524
science, and always smelled like lab chemicals. 
Anyway, Dr. Potts' office was up on the third floor

10:17.504 --> 10:27.531
and we were sitting there and he looked at my high 
school transcript and said, well, Eddie Joe, you

10:17.504 --> 10:27.531
need to be an ag journalism major. And I said, well, 
Dr. Potts, what's that? And he said, well, you've

10:32.245 --> 10:35.649
got, obviously you like English and you can write. 
You've got good grades in high school English. You

10:38.691 --> 10:40.693
know, you've got this background in agriculture. 
It's a great program. A lot of future in this.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.858
People can, you know, you can do a lot of different 
things. He was a real promoter of agricultural

10:46.518 --> 10:49.761
journalism. So I said, hey, sounds good to me. And 
that's how I started and that's how I finished.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.429
Now, there was one other major influence And that 
is that Anderson Clayton gave a $1,000

10:58.409 --> 11:08.318
scholarship in the junior and senior year to 
someone in ag journalism. Well, I had my eyes on

11:09.007 --> 11:13.613
that, and I needed the money. So I thought, well, if 
I can do well enough in the freshman and sophomore

11:14.474 --> 11:19.760
year, I might be able to latch on to that 
scholarship. And that was the motivator. And so

11:23.825 --> 11:27.089
you came briefly early in the summer? Sometime, 
probably, I would say July. uh was there other than

11:29.560 --> 11:53.745
meeting dr potts did you carry any impression of 
the campus away there was a there was a general

11:29.560 --> 11:53.745
meeting in the uh i think it was on the second floor 
of the chemistry building in a you know lord not the

11:29.560 --> 11:53.745
old large general lecture hall but in large 
probably a hundred student lecture hall And it was

11:54.316 --> 11:55.978
sort of an orientation. At the end of it, by the way, 
you picked your core outfit, quote. Actually, it

12:03.025 --> 12:07.870
was picked for you because what they did in those 
days is they assigned you by major. And as an ag

12:09.131 --> 12:15.198
major, I had the choice of if I wanted to be in the Air 
Force, I could be in Squadron 6. If I wanted to be in

12:15.298 --> 12:18.501
the Army, I could be in C1 or D1. Well, I didn't know 
what one or the other meant. So I get in line. They

12:25.119 --> 12:26.101
split you off. And they ask you, you want to be Army 
or Air Force? You tell them, and they put you in the

12:27.946 --> 12:30.853
outfit. those were interesting places because of 
the mix of the people, mostly old country boys. And

12:41.967 --> 12:44.811
it was a different experience. I mean, the people 
weren't different, but putting them together in

12:44.892 --> 12:49.519
that kind of an arrangement was different. But 
that's the only other memory I have about the

12:49.539 --> 12:52.985
place. There was no advanced placement test. 
There was no hooping and hollering and all the good

12:55.910 --> 13:03.262
stuff that they do these days, it was pretty get 
them in, get them out, we got better things to do.

13:03.883 --> 13:06.528
Alright, so then you go home and then come back. Oh, 
and I did sign up for fish camp. Oh, okay. Yeah, and

13:09.653 --> 13:11.656
that was one of the other things you did while you 
were here. Again, not quite knowing what that was.

13:14.050 --> 13:35.518
but being encouraged by gordon gay i think was the 
person that as i recall was the person that really

13:14.050 --> 13:35.518
motivated everybody to sign up for fish camp who 
was you know the old uh director of the y director of

13:14.050 --> 13:35.518
the ymca and the campus minister uh describe fish 
camp as as you uh understood it Well, it was really

13:36.005 --> 13:38.648
not a bad experience. I met a lot of people at fish 
camp, just like happens today, that sort of remain

13:38.829 --> 13:49.222
your relationships throughout your college 
experience. A friend of mine named Barney Fudge

13:49.242 --> 13:56.953
from Burke Burnett, Texas, and I were in the same 
cabin at fish camp. And neither one of us knew we

13:57.013 --> 13:58.755
were although we had played sports against each 
other in high school, we didn't know we were both

13:59.427 --> 14:03.331
coming here. So Barney and I formed a fast. And 
there's an interesting end to that story, which we

14:06.254 --> 14:12.521
can save until later, with regard to the senior 
year. And Fish Camp was then held? Palestine. At

14:16.906 --> 14:17.807
the Methodist? Right, Methodist Assembly. And 
did you, was it a worthy event? At worthwhile

14:22.512 --> 14:24.554
investment of time? When you're 18 years old, it's 
pretty hard to judge. No, but as you look. What was

14:31.261 --> 14:31.842
or wasn't. Oh, yeah, I thought it was, again, it 
wasn't nearly as organized nor as

14:32.082 --> 14:40.691
tradition-bound. What it really was in those days 
was a way to help you think about transitioning

14:41.612 --> 14:49.060
away from home uh there was a lot of spiritual based 
uh discussion again gordon gay was was a principal

14:49.968 --> 15:14.018
in it and it was probably more being thoughtful 
about uh not losing all of your values and and

14:49.968 --> 15:14.018
leaving home and forgetting home and and then of 
course a lot of things about a m but not in the sense

14:49.968 --> 15:14.018
that you're taught today that i at least from my 
observation about the rah-rah tradition

15:14.673 --> 15:17.779
oriented. It was much more of a quiet, a little 
simpler activity. All right, so you go back home

15:24.171 --> 15:26.536
and then come back. No, didn't go back home. Came 
here, went to fish camp, and then came back from

15:29.541 --> 15:34.130
fish camp. How did you get here for that fish camp 
trip? Well, I was a rare person. My dad had bought

15:40.320 --> 15:45.437
the first new automobile we ever owned in 1957. We 
had a pretty nice wheat crop. He bought a 57 Ford.

15:50.701 --> 16:19.392
the cheapest model ever made okay i mean it was it 
had no chrome it had no in fact we had it suited out

15:50.701 --> 16:19.392
with those clear plastic seats as soon as we got it 
out of the dealership it cost 1900 never never

15:50.701 --> 16:19.392
forget it in the fall in the fall of 1963 my dad 
bought a pickup truck because he was tired of

15:50.701 --> 16:19.392
hauling things around in that 57 ford and Told me I 
could bring it to A&M. So I was one of the rare

16:21.515 --> 16:23.318
characters. In my outfit of freshman, there were 
three cars, about probably 30, 35 kids. So I drove

16:32.733 --> 16:34.476
down here. As far as you can recall, what did you 
bring? What possessions did you bring? I had a

16:38.742 --> 16:39.844
footlocker. and I think everything I owned was in 
that footlocker. Did you bring many civilian

16:45.251 --> 16:47.194
clothes at all? I didn't have any civilian, I mean I 
had I had five pair of Levi's and I had five because

16:47.214 --> 16:59.352
that way my mother only had to wash once a week and 
mostly For graduation, I got white shirts,

16:59.332 --> 17:06.381
short-sleeved, from John's Dry Goods in 
Henrietta, Texas. So I had a few white

17:07.102 --> 17:12.008
short-sleeved shirts, two pair of cowboy boots. 
It went a long time in my life not knowing that you

17:13.370 --> 17:19.597
could cut boots off and make shoes out of them. And 
those Levi's, and that was about it. Did you bring a

17:23.362 --> 17:25.125
radio or a record player? I had a little sort of 
table record player, which my dad had bought at

17:25.165 --> 17:35.582
Second Monday in Bowie some years before. Didn't 
have many records, but brought what I had. My

17:40.169 --> 17:50.445
sophomore roommate, by the way, had a brother who 
had a great jazz collection, and so I became a jazz

17:40.169 --> 17:50.445
fan during my sophomore year. But that was sort of 
what you did. You accumulated around what

17:52.107 --> 17:56.734
everybody brought, but not many possessions. I 
think... I believe I had an oscillating fan too,

17:59.238 --> 18:06.882
which became fairly important in those old norms 
that didn't have any air conditioning. When did

18:06.902 --> 18:09.370
you get assigned to a room? Was it before fish camp 
or after?

18:13.767 --> 18:21.135
I think I came and put my stuff in the room when I 
arrived, and then left maybe that same day.

18:22.217 --> 18:29.685
Describe for an observer how one got broken into 
the Corps in those days. Well, I had a little bit of

18:31.427 --> 18:42.880
an awakening because I wasn't, although I knew, 
one of the things I remember, and I think I still

18:31.427 --> 18:42.880
have it somewhere, was I got a fish handbook. that 
was produced by the YMCA. and that came to me

18:46.960 --> 19:16.680
sometime between the agreement to come and 
showing up and it had stuff in there like what do you

18:46.960 --> 19:16.680
call the food and how do you you know what what's 
whip out mean all that stuff so you're sort of

18:46.960 --> 19:16.680
figuring this out a little bit but not very much 
because as you make your way into the dorm you know

18:46.960 --> 19:16.680
you're looking for help you got a foot locker that 
weighs 60 pounds or something you're trying to get

18:46.960 --> 19:16.680
to the fourth floor And all of a sudden, people 
start yelling at you for no good reason. You know,

19:20.165 --> 19:21.306
you just showed up. And they begin to give you 
instructions in a rather forceful manner.

19:30.679 --> 19:38.470
My freshman company commander was a guy named 
Charlie Fisher from Cuero. And Charlie was a guy

19:38.490 --> 19:45.520
who was, he was probably the, of the models you 
could have, he was more the gentle type. And that

19:46.563 --> 19:55.375
whole senior class was a good senior class, smart 
people I remember, many of them. That'd be class of

19:55.395 --> 19:56.336
64? That'd be the class of 64. The classes sort of 
got worse as you went down in time. And I'm counting

20:03.486 --> 20:05.929
my own in that group. The juniors were probably not 
as good a quality. The sophomores were worse. And

20:11.256 --> 20:15.422
we were just a bunch of ragtags.

20:16.128 --> 20:23.137
And the first sergeant was a guy named Robert 
Parker, and he was really quite the opposite of

20:16.128 --> 20:23.137
Charlie Fisher. So, you know, what I remember 
about it is, and also I remember meeting my fish old

20:23.698 --> 20:34.672
lady, a fellow named Fred Youngman from Rio Medina 
over near San Antonio. First time I'd really ever

20:35.573 --> 20:38.457
been around a good Catholic boy. In fact, one of my 
first memories in the room was the first night we

20:39.820 --> 20:45.689
spent together in the room. It had been a rather 
hectic day. I was in the top bunk, had just gone to

20:49.255 --> 20:52.941
bed. Fred had stayed up to study, had his desk lamp 
on. and i was in that little period when you're half

20:57.067 --> 21:18.906
asleep but not quite i woke startled and noticed he 
was on his knees next to the bed and i thought he was

20:57.067 --> 21:18.906
sick and i started saying fred fred are you okay 
fred are you okay and he looked up and he said i'm

20:57.067 --> 21:18.906
praying

21:18.886 --> 21:28.662
I think for survival, but it just had never 
occurred to me to get on your knees as he had done and

21:18.886 --> 21:28.662
pray. So that was an early introduction to 
diversity, let's put it that way. And this was

21:35.153 --> 21:36.816
Company C? C-1. C-1. What was the nickname? Saber 
C. Saber C. Or C-Troop Jocks. It was an old cavalry

21:42.545 --> 21:44.809
outfit, in fact, where— other than the Ross 
Volunteers, we're the only outfit to wear yellow.

21:49.789 --> 21:54.258
We wore yellow, whatever you call those things, 
mascots. And what else was distinctive about it as

21:54.278 --> 22:00.290
C Troop thought about itself? Oh, again, it was... 
The person who came, one of the things I noticed

22:03.352 --> 22:09.106
about A&M early on was everybody was from Houston. 
You know, you show up from a little town of

22:09.667 --> 22:18.188
Henrietta, everybody you meet on the campus, it 
seemed like, was from Houston, which was like a

22:09.667 --> 22:18.188
foreign land to me. But in our little outfit, most 
of those boys were from places like Merkle and

22:18.438 --> 22:30.662
Aspermont and Fate and, you know, Schulenburg and 
Weimar. And to have someone from Houston was a

22:30.783 --> 22:39.079
rarity because, again, we were an ag outfit, and 
what they did is they stashed all of the old ag boys

22:30.783 --> 22:39.079
in there. As a result, collectively, there was not 
a lot of brain power in the outfit. It was just a

22:44.218 --> 22:46.602
collection of good old boys. And as a result, our 
activities and our fun tended to revolve around

22:47.423 --> 22:56.977
things that country boys would do.

22:57.858 --> 23:01.003
My junior roommate was a fellow from Dallas. And he 
was, by today's standards, or those days

23:01.023 --> 23:04.969
standards, a sophisticate. And then we had a 
couple of guys come in as frogs from houston who i

23:09.856 --> 23:27.257
guess they didn't have any other place to put them 
they put them in our outfit and they were both sort

23:09.856 --> 23:27.257
of city boys with money which we didn't and it 
turned out to be if they survived that transition

23:09.856 --> 23:27.257
they were really good guys and these were and this 
is mid-september Yeah, we started actually I

23:27.828 --> 23:33.778
guess about September the 15th or so. In those 
days, you started later. And one of the memories,

23:37.405 --> 23:45.880
by the way, of the first week was there must have 
been a tropical depression or hurricane in the

23:37.405 --> 23:45.880
Gulf. And I came from where it hadn't rained since, 
you know, usually there was one rain midsummer. it

23:52.972 --> 24:10.018
started raining the day we got here and it rained 
for about ten straight days I thought I had never

23:52.972 --> 24:10.018
seen so much water in all my life and we before you 
know the other memory of the first week or so as soon

23:52.972 --> 24:10.018
as you got here they hauled you over by marching you 
to the old property warehouse, military property

24:11.315 --> 24:24.434
warehouse, which was in the shadow of the water 
tower. And you would get in line, and you'd walk

24:26.156 --> 24:38.233
down the line, and there were these old guys 
probably from the Brazos bottom that had been

24:26.156 --> 24:38.233
doing this for 1,000 years, and they'd look at you 
and go, and they'd throw you some khakis. I mean,

24:39.580 --> 24:44.806
and all they were trying to do was sort of get it 
within maybe six or eight inches of correct. You

24:45.927 --> 24:50.232
get back to the dorm, put these things on, and they 
were hanging all over you. So there were places all

24:51.554 --> 25:02.787
around the campus, park cleaners are still over 
here, that you had to then find your way to those

24:51.554 --> 25:02.787
places to get those uniforms fitted Because you 
couldn't, I mean, there wasn't any, you didn't go

25:03.644 --> 25:09.712
down and think about it and try it on and all that 
stuff. They just threw it to you. You stuffed it in a

25:11.394 --> 25:16.320
duffel bag and hoped that you could get it close. 
Well, that was traumatic because you were in

25:16.420 --> 25:24.971
little dressing rooms with these curtains that 
pulled back and forth. It was September in Bryan

25:25.632 --> 25:28.155
College Station. No place was air conditioned. 
Mm-hmm. By the time you got the khakis on, they were

25:31.285 --> 25:34.449
wilted. So it was really, that part I do not 
remember fondly, believe me. Describe how the

25:42.420 --> 25:52.935
sophomores and the other members of the Corps got 
you guys straightened out and acclimated to

25:42.420 --> 25:52.935
the... There was probably... Oh, and I know you 
know the routine, typically up at 6 with on the

25:55.940 --> 26:09.504
wall, which we called on the wall by 620. And at that 
point in time, you went through inspections. If

26:14.032 --> 26:17.458
you weren't the whistle jockey, if you were the 
whistle jockey, you started a lot earlier.

26:17.438 --> 26:22.204
because you were responsible for running three 
cycles of waking everybody up. People must have

26:22.584 --> 26:30.874
been very hard to wake up because that was loud and 
rather disruptive to your own schedule. But

26:30.894 --> 26:45.572
during the time you were on the wall, you were 
intensely scrutinized with regard to your

26:30.894 --> 26:45.572
appearance, your uniform, your brass, you know 
another thing was they gave you brass that had the

26:45.552 --> 27:06.463
you know what we call maidenhead it had sprayed on 
lacquer and the first thing you had to do was get

26:45.552 --> 27:06.463
that damn lacquer off of it you know you couldn't be 
seen with so this was traumatic because none of us

26:45.552 --> 27:06.463
knew how to do that and so part of the training was to 
show you how to turn the water on in the sink, run it

27:06.815 --> 27:21.783
till it got so hot that it would melt the sink, and 
then put this brass tin in there and run it until you

27:06.815 --> 27:21.783
finally had melted that maidenhead off. And then 
you had to shine it. And then you'd have little bits

27:23.466 --> 27:28.215
in the cracks, and they would jump all over you for 
that. Then you typically made it downstairs to

27:28.195 --> 27:34.352
formation and off to morning chow. And you never 
stopped being inspected or harassed. That was the

27:42.354 --> 27:44.179
official part. And then there was, you know, I 
think we might have been here a few days before

27:44.902 --> 27:54.832
class started because we spent a lot of time 
marching and learning how to march and all the

27:44.902 --> 27:54.832
proper military courtesy and all that. Had you had 
any, you had not been in any kind of military in high

27:55.113 --> 28:01.539
school or anything like that? Not in Henrietta. 
Yeah, this is all brand new. All brand new. The only

28:06.124 --> 28:11.770
thing was my brother was in the Navy and he brought 
me home a Blue Jackets manual. from and I had worn

28:11.750 --> 28:28.948
that thing out going through it learning about you 
know how to fold clothes and all that stuff didn't

28:11.750 --> 28:28.948
have any any real relationship to this but no there 
was no military training in high school the

28:11.750 --> 28:28.948
unfortunately in those days Except for call to 
quarters, which was right after chow till 10.30.

28:36.585 --> 28:45.482
You know, you were fair game for a sophomore or 
anybody else anytime you were in the dorm and

28:36.585 --> 28:45.482
anytime after call to quarters. I mean, they did 
tend to protect that three-hour period in there

28:45.703 --> 28:51.274
for study. But any other time, you found little 
nooks and crannies around the campus to hide. Such

29:00.101 --> 29:01.142
as? What were those nooks and crannies? Oh, the 
library was a favorite. And it sort of bothered

29:06.611 --> 29:12.520
them a little bit because there they could see you 
and knew you were there and knew they couldn't get

29:06.611 --> 29:12.520
their hands on you. The MSC was also sort of 
protected turf. Spent a lot of time under the wings

29:18.627 --> 29:26.617
of the Medal of Honor winners along that north 
portico of the MSC. And, you know, occasionally

29:27.718 --> 29:38.271
you would find a classroom or a building where 
there was a little place you could hide out, but

29:27.718 --> 29:38.271
those were the two main things, two main places. 
How did you, those courses, your first fall, how

29:38.251 --> 29:46.176
did you select the courses you were taking? I 
didn't. I had no, there was no selection. I was

29:50.128 --> 29:51.653
assigned I took 17 hours my freshman's fall 
semester, which was considered a light load. And I

29:59.138 --> 30:09.434
was the only freshman in our outfit that was my 
distinguished student the fall semester. Why

30:09.895 --> 30:12.038
that's important was It was sort of hard for 
everybody to figure out because they didn't see me

30:13.520 --> 30:17.727
studying any more than anybody else did. And I 
probably didn't. But what happened was a little

30:19.810 --> 30:28.163
high school where I went, I had an old made English 
teacher who was quite good. Didn't know it then. I

30:29.405 --> 30:30.166
understand it now. Had a chemistry teacher who was 
a person right out of college. He went to North

30:36.836 --> 30:41.063
Texas, ran track, and was the track coach, but 
taught chemistry. but was an extraordinary

30:41.752 --> 30:43.874
teacher. A math teacher named Mr. Beeler, 
B-E-E-L-E-R, who had a speech impediment, so all

30:44.755 --> 30:55.444
of his words were hard to understand, but the guy 
was a good math teacher. So I came to A&M basically

30:55.984 --> 31:03.371
with an ability to pass that first semester no 
problem. Second semester, I hit second semester

31:03.391 --> 31:07.935
chemistry, sort of went the other direction. 
Another interesting part of that is I had... I was

31:11.992 --> 31:12.895
color blind. And so one of the things you had to do in 
the chemistry lab was to titrate. And I couldn't

31:17.470 --> 31:20.801
tell whenever it turned colors. I just poured 
until the chemicals ran out. And then someone else

31:22.868 --> 31:24.955
would have to show me.
