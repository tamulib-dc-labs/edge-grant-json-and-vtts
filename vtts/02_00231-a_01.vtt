WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:15.587
So the first year it was on rented land, the nurseries of all the genetic material from the upper five spring wheat states of the U.S.

00:16.809 --> 00:19.452
and the Canada Department of Agriculture.

00:19.472 --> 00:32.670
Then the second year it was on our research station in Ciudad de Obregón, which was the research station of the Mexican government in the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:33.275 --> 00:34.277
send the seed down.

00:34.878 --> 00:38.104
Sometimes Fletcher would come and help us plant it.

00:38.144 --> 00:49.005
Then all of their scientists from each of the states would come down when the grain was ripening and harvest and take it back to their own stations.

00:49.812 --> 00:59.872
Or they would select the plants and trash them out, and Fletcher would arrange to have it shipped back to Minneapolis, and then from there they would send it to all of the participating states.

01:00.514 --> 01:11.095
And you see, this was the cut in half, like we had done for the last ten years, the time required for them to produce varieties.

01:11.665 --> 01:15.731
And it was when they were down there that they began to see what was going on.

01:15.751 --> 01:24.242
As a matter of fact, those first dwarfs, Fletcher took some of those, he says, can I cut some heads off those first F2s?

01:24.302 --> 01:27.046
This was when, this must have been, let's see.

01:31.352 --> 01:39.343
In the spring of 57, yeah, of 57,

01:40.505 --> 01:41.766
in Sonora.

01:42.147 --> 01:44.849
They were beautiful in all kinds of heights and whatnot.

01:44.869 --> 01:45.490
I said, sure.

01:45.530 --> 01:58.403
He said, I want to take them back and shell them out and give a few seeds to each of the research directors back in the five northwest states and also in Canada.

01:59.184 --> 02:04.669
I said, take what you want except leave some of the heads on each plant.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.371
But there was not much interest.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.453
The idea at that time was that

02:09.563 --> 02:15.271
These are all right for irrigation, but you can't use them under dry land, because this will make them too short.

02:16.633 --> 02:27.389
Well, that was the false concept, because under dry land conditions, these things are slightly shorter, but they don't, they aren't shortened in the same way as the tall one is, with drought.

02:27.409 --> 02:31.194
The degree of shortening, yeah, something like this.

02:31.595 --> 02:33.177
But that wasn't known at that time.

02:33.618 --> 02:36.502
So they thought this was a bunch of nonsense.

02:37.543 --> 02:39.486
So it was quite a few years before.

02:40.208 --> 02:43.213
Some of them started doing something about this.

02:43.233 --> 02:47.981
Of course, at that early time, there was very little fertilizer used on spring wheats in the USA also.

02:49.042 --> 02:58.858
The Western California, starting to be, and on the winter wheats in the state of Washington and Oregon were vocal that had been incorporating.

02:59.579 --> 03:07.532
I would imagine that, well, it was several years before they started crossing.

03:08.474 --> 03:13.881
And so, in other words, it wasn't through scholarly publications that word of your experiments got out.

03:13.901 --> 03:20.630
It was basically through your colleagues and through governments.

03:20.730 --> 03:23.073
One government to the next government.

03:23.093 --> 03:23.754
That's right.

03:23.774 --> 03:37.992
And in the same way, through this original vehicle, when this international rust nursery, when we saw some of these...

03:39.828 --> 03:41.350
that were fairly uniform.

03:42.171 --> 03:49.340
Immediately we put those, we always used to put in about 50 different wheats, that's all they would accept from us because the nursery got too big.

03:50.602 --> 03:56.449
And as soon as we had, I think there were five that looked fairly uniform, we put them into this.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.055
They went to Bellsville.

04:01.075 --> 04:05.160
They multiplied the seed at that time, I think, in Puerto Rico because of corn tea.

04:05.981 --> 04:09.025
Anyway, they went around the world.

04:10.051 --> 04:18.422
This was, as a result of these, this was where Swami Naftan over in India saw these five little ones in 1960, 62.

04:21.687 --> 04:27.014
But prior to that... And that's how India found out about your work then, in a sense.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.916
Well, we're going to get to that.

04:29.637 --> 04:39.130
I think I should say that by 60, by 1959, we had enough trained people, Mexicans,

04:39.599 --> 04:46.469
good ones, so that the program was turned over to them when it was still part of the Mexican government and Rockefeller Foundation.

04:46.669 --> 04:51.536
This was the first program, corn and all of the other programs.

04:52.297 --> 05:01.049
We started out with corn, wheat, and beans, but later forage crops were added and quite a few other crops, potatoes and a whole series of them.

05:01.069 --> 05:07.378
But we turned the responsibilities for the directorship of the program over to

05:07.679 --> 05:20.714
Narvaez, Ignacio Narvaez, Dr. Ignacio Narvaez, N-A-R-V-A-E-Z, when he came back from Purdue in 1959.

05:20.814 --> 05:24.158
And at that time, I continued to work with him.

05:24.799 --> 05:30.525
Most of the Rockefeller staff, though, a year later, had been transferred.

05:30.545 --> 05:37.213
But in 59, this gave me a chance to look at the wheat problems in many other countries.

05:38.172 --> 05:52.306
first in 59, especially spend more time in each of the South American programs, Guatemala, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil.

05:54.488 --> 06:06.981
And then following spring in 60, which was when the work of the Office of Special Studies, the Rockefeller Mexican government had terminated,

06:07.720 --> 06:16.592
And the responsibilities had been transferred to the National Institute of Agricultural Research of Mexico, INIA.

06:17.794 --> 06:22.139
But there were several of us who were still around in the transfer, working with them.

06:23.041 --> 06:35.297
And it was then that the New York office of the foundation wanted me to have a look at the wheat problems from Morocco to India.

06:35.699 --> 06:41.526
I should have said that my job was essentially finished.

06:41.546 --> 06:42.727
Yeah, by the late 1950s.

06:42.747 --> 06:46.792
By what we thought was the original purpose of the Mexican program.

06:46.932 --> 06:47.894
Right.

06:48.695 --> 06:52.479
Which was, of course, to make Mexico self-sufficient a week.

06:52.499 --> 06:52.619
Right.

06:52.639 --> 06:54.281
And turn the program over to them.

06:54.301 --> 06:54.582
Yeah.

06:54.602 --> 07:00.909
And so I talked to Mosman.

07:00.929 --> 07:04.153
They didn't know what they were going to do at that time.

07:04.673 --> 07:07.757
I said, why don't you let me work on soybeans?

07:07.797 --> 07:11.923
No soybeans for the tropics at that time, or semi-tropics.

07:11.943 --> 07:19.433
They argued about this for a while, and Carrar and Mosman, I don't know who else was all involved.

07:19.453 --> 07:24.339
Eventually Mosman reached the decision, he says, hell, that's a waste of talent.

07:24.500 --> 07:28.765
If you've got this much experience, you should stay in wheat.

07:28.806 --> 07:34.393
We've got to find some way to make you effective on a broader scale.

07:34.863 --> 07:43.096
Then with SAO, in the spring of 60, they sent me on this trip from Morocco to India.

07:43.516 --> 07:45.900
And I visited whatever it was.

07:46.140 --> 07:52.470
And we're going to get to that trip, and I don't want to talk about that, but I still have some questions about earlier.

07:55.294 --> 08:01.123
One of the questions is training Mexican economists and scientists.

08:01.593 --> 08:03.195
How did that come about?

08:03.555 --> 08:05.317
Was that part of the original process?

08:05.437 --> 08:07.379
And where did you send them to train them?

08:07.700 --> 08:31.245
Well, the original purpose, one of the four objectives when the program was started was to train a core of Mexican scientists in all of the disciplines that affect food production, meaning agronomy and soils, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, cereal technology, the whole gamut of things.

08:31.934 --> 08:36.118
And eventually it was economics and policy.

08:36.138 --> 08:37.379
In the early years it was not.

08:39.140 --> 08:49.089
And the training program from its conception was a hands-on type.

08:50.150 --> 09:01.300
When I arrived, there's only one scientist that I thought had had any experience with experimental plots that

09:04.992 --> 09:10.440
And that he had had sufficient background, so he knew research methodology.

09:11.662 --> 09:17.109
The late Edmundo Tabuada, who died just about a year ago.

09:19.052 --> 09:20.955
But he was essentially the only one.

09:21.936 --> 09:26.002
And that meant that we had to train the whole corps of scientists.

09:26.603 --> 09:33.092
The way it was done, young people who had gotten their first degree, they call it Ingeniero Agrónomo,

09:33.545 --> 09:36.349
In Mexico, it follows the French system of education.

09:38.792 --> 09:45.500
Most of them, since most of them didn't come from the land, it was a completely theoretical training.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.925
And they were brought into the experimental stations where we worked.

09:48.945 --> 09:59.839
They worked right with us, elbow to elbow, in all of the mechanics of the operation, generally for two years, sometimes three.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.522
And from this group, we picked the best.

10:03.160 --> 10:10.072
to send outside of the country for advanced graduate training, master's degree.

10:10.092 --> 10:13.598
In the early years, none stayed straight through for a doctor.

10:13.618 --> 10:15.561
They went for a master's and came back.

10:16.523 --> 10:22.253
And the good ones we brought back into the training program with us to help train other young ones.

10:22.934 --> 10:25.378
It was a pretty strong screening process.

10:27.782 --> 10:28.864
You have to remember

10:29.097 --> 10:36.125
And at that time there was no graduate school in any agricultural sciences anywhere in Latin America.

10:37.246 --> 10:45.695
And it was painful because of the fact that English was, very few of these had any English background.

10:46.436 --> 10:49.380
And that was an obstacle.

10:49.400 --> 10:49.700
Still is.

10:49.720 --> 10:53.104
And who paid for their education and where did you usually send them?

10:53.544 --> 10:56.067
In those early years, the Rockefeller Foundation gave

10:56.637 --> 11:04.365
At the master's level we called them scholarships, and at the doctor's level they were fellowships, but they were essentially the same.

11:04.605 --> 11:20.041
I think they had never worked with all of their previous work in grants for education had been at doctorate level in chemistry or some other field of science in other countries.

11:20.061 --> 11:21.903
So they made this distinction.

11:22.023 --> 11:26.087
I think it was purely arbitrary.

11:27.957 --> 11:29.519
Then the best ones would come back.

11:29.659 --> 11:34.846
And, of course, there were many opportunities for employment, but we tried to keep some of the best with us.

11:35.467 --> 11:40.853
Oh, yeah, much as seed companies or the federal government or someone would want to get a hold of them.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.658
The first one nobody wanted, the first two.

11:44.678 --> 11:46.481
They didn't know what the hell it was.

11:46.501 --> 11:47.462
There were no jobs.

11:47.782 --> 11:48.483
It was miserable.

11:49.404 --> 11:55.272
And we put them back in the program, two of them.

11:55.292 --> 11:57.795
The third one... When was that, mid-50s or...?

11:58.231 --> 11:59.552
No, in the early 50s.

11:59.692 --> 12:00.313
Early 50s.

12:01.634 --> 12:02.055
Let's see.

12:04.337 --> 12:10.582
Maybe even as early as, no, it was 47, 48, 49.

12:10.943 --> 12:26.297
One of them that couldn't get a job became the organizer of the agricultural sciences at Monterey Tech.

12:27.425 --> 12:29.068
And he remained there his whole career.

12:29.088 --> 12:31.572
He just retired a year ago.

12:32.634 --> 12:41.209
That became a top flight school and trained not only a lot of good Mexicans, but Central Americans, South Americans.

12:43.373 --> 12:44.956
It's a private school.

12:45.056 --> 12:50.766
I mean, you pay tuition and consequently it was never...

12:51.387 --> 12:58.914
never had the troubles of strikes like so many of the government schools have had, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general.

12:58.934 --> 13:09.723
So, they worked for many different institutions, depending on where we thought they'd get the best training in the discipline.

13:09.803 --> 13:19.572
For example, in plant pathology, some of the early ones went to Minnesota, to Wisconsin, and to Purdue.

13:19.872 --> 13:28.002
In soils, very often they went to Cornell and to Iowa State.

13:28.623 --> 13:33.328
And Iowa State also got quite a few in genetics, plant breeding.

13:33.669 --> 13:35.971
But they went to many different institutions.

13:36.492 --> 13:37.713
Some of them went on beans.

13:37.774 --> 13:44.041
They went to Colorado and I guess even to Idaho.

13:44.061 --> 13:44.902
So it varied.

13:44.922 --> 13:47.365
And if it was potatoes, they went to either

13:48.323 --> 13:52.747
Cornell or to Wisconsin.

13:52.767 --> 13:58.652
You sent them to the best place and you never had any problem getting them into those institutions.

13:59.113 --> 14:04.298
We had it arranged before they went.

14:04.318 --> 14:05.999
It was a problem because of language.

14:08.601 --> 14:11.284
But they did amazingly well.

14:11.304 --> 14:15.748
Virtually with only a couple of exceptions.

14:16.673 --> 14:21.400
that didn't get degrees, all of them got degrees, meaning that they were pretty well selected.

14:21.860 --> 14:26.968
In a couple of cases when they didn't, I think they didn't have the stability.

14:27.148 --> 14:40.487
They got nervous and health problems came in, but there were very few.

14:40.788 --> 14:44.231
Okay, we've got some more questions on this.

14:44.251 --> 14:49.456
Well, I was just wondering about that, but do you have something else that you want to continue on?

14:49.476 --> 14:50.457
I have a lot of questions.

14:50.477 --> 14:51.678
Okay, go ahead.

14:51.698 --> 15:09.195
Okay, there's another issue that I wanted to talk about, and that was, we've already talked about this somewhat, and that's cultural problems, dealing with American scientists abroad, and how at first they didn't want to accept anything that you had to say, and then afterwards you became somewhat of a hero.

15:09.255 --> 15:10.356
Would that be too strong?

15:12.580 --> 15:20.549
With the farmers, I think the skepticism was because of the setting especially.

15:20.589 --> 15:22.151
Well, I think it's generally everywhere.

15:23.172 --> 15:32.303
Because until contributions are made by a scientist, there's a big doubt.

15:33.044 --> 15:37.609
I saw it in our own society when I was in high school.

15:37.629 --> 15:39.111
I've seen it everywhere I've ever been.

15:39.766 --> 16:07.258
I think it was probably at its worst in Sonora, Mexico, because of the fact that this visionary leader, Don Rodolfo, Elias Caiz, when he was governor in 1934, had set up this beautiful station, well-equipped with machinery and blooded animals and the whole thing that came into being, I suppose, probably began to operate in 1937.

16:08.167 --> 16:12.392
By the time I arrived in 44, it was a shambles.

16:12.412 --> 16:21.263
No animals, machinery, none of it operable, windows busted out, complete disaster.

16:22.064 --> 16:31.256
One variety of wheat that had been put out from that station, which served very well for the first couple of years, was mentana.

16:31.977 --> 16:35.201
Then it got cleaned up with stem rust three years in a row.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.043
When we walked in,

16:37.529 --> 16:40.355
kind of environment we found.

16:41.377 --> 16:50.096
And the community leader, the ex-governor, ex-son of the president, was completely disillusioned.

16:50.757 --> 16:53.884
The only way back was through results.

16:54.556 --> 17:07.612
So, then after 1956, when production levels were soaring and Mexico became self-sufficient in wheat, then they must have changed their attitude tremendously.

17:08.653 --> 17:18.285
Yes, and it began to happen with the varieties as early as 1950.

17:18.620 --> 17:22.144
Agony was prolonged with the fertilizer for another two or three years.

17:22.164 --> 17:23.465
Oh yeah, we talked about the fertilizer problem.

17:23.485 --> 17:24.767
Went through the same agony.

17:25.768 --> 17:41.325
And then by about 1954, Rodolfo Cais, the same person that had the vision of making that beautiful station, came out and he said, all right, we're convinced.

17:42.125 --> 17:48.272
Now we want to know how to put this station back into a functioning organization.

17:49.602 --> 18:00.936
so that the people who are working in agriculture will have the things they need to work with and that you won't have to live here like in the miserable conditions you're working in now.

18:02.418 --> 18:04.220
And I told him that it was the wrong place.

18:04.741 --> 18:07.745
At that time we still had no roads, just dust.

18:08.986 --> 18:13.271
One season a year with dust that deep and then when it rained, mud.

18:14.893 --> 18:19.339
And it was this old station was about...

18:21.057 --> 18:27.567
20 miles from town, no rural school for the families of the staff.

18:30.031 --> 18:33.356
Even the water from the deep well was salty.

18:33.817 --> 18:35.279
A whole series of problems.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.602
And we didn't have any transport.

18:37.622 --> 18:42.129
We had one old broken-down pickup that's for the whole staff.

18:42.850 --> 18:46.636
No assurance there was going to be much more budget.

18:46.656 --> 18:48.499
So, I suggested to them that we should

18:49.458 --> 18:53.102
He should try to find a piece of land close to the city.

18:54.724 --> 19:11.281
There was then a gravel road running out south where we wouldn't have to have hanging around our neck the problems of the children and family of the engineers, of the technical people.

19:11.301 --> 19:19.009
And he went, the leader that he was, got his hat and went to all the agribusiness, including the commercial business,

19:19.495 --> 19:22.059
whether they were selling clothing or what.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.063
He knew how to shake the tree.

19:25.083 --> 19:41.949
He got enough money, and he bought 100 hectares of land that was still in brush, about six miles south of Ogrigón, which is where the Ciano, the main Northwest Research Center, is today.

19:42.630 --> 19:45.274
And today that center is called Ciano.

19:45.294 --> 19:48.118
This is the Spanish acronym for

19:48.875 --> 19:57.286
Centro de Investigación Agricola del Noroeste, which is the northwest branch of the National Institute of Agricultural Research, INEA.

19:58.307 --> 20:09.742
And that station today has probably had a bigger impact on training scientists, wheat scientists, around the world than any other single station over the last 25 years.

20:10.422 --> 20:18.713
And not only young people, but also visiting scientists and administrators.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.994
That was established in 1955.

20:25.079 --> 20:33.790
But even more important, about a couple of years later, Rodolfo Caiz went farther.

20:35.112 --> 20:37.655
We had the damnedest bureaucracies.

20:39.638 --> 20:46.827
Well, they still exist in most places in the world, but I kept telling him that when we ordered things,

20:47.380 --> 21:17.202
sometimes be a year before he gets such simple things through the ministry as notebooks and paper and pencils and so he took upon himself to organize what we call the patronato para investigación agricola which is the literally translated be the patron in support of agricultural research the farmers contributions directly out of sales

21:17.485 --> 21:20.588
not by law, just by voluntary contributions.

21:21.069 --> 21:36.484
When they sell, it was so much a ton on all of the wheat layered into cotton, beans, rice in those early days, the whole thing.

21:36.504 --> 21:43.250
That has grown into a statewide organization to which all farmers contribute voluntarily.

21:43.971 --> 21:46.834
Big, small, the collective heat of farmers,

21:47.337 --> 21:51.442
It was started like I used to get.

21:51.502 --> 21:52.303
To support research.

21:53.024 --> 21:55.728
So we'd get some freedom of movement.

21:55.908 --> 21:56.348
Yeah.

21:56.369 --> 22:00.874
Because these funds, originally he made a mistake.

22:01.815 --> 22:08.824
They went into the, he would collect them, send them to the Ministry of Agriculture to disperse them.

22:08.844 --> 22:09.846
Yeah, you were telling me about this.

22:09.966 --> 22:12.329
And hell, none of it came back and it didn't change a bit.

22:13.350 --> 22:13.470
Right.

22:13.490 --> 22:17.175
And finally he stormed down there in New Mexico City.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.908
At that time, he wanted me to go with him to the Director General's office.

22:24.051 --> 22:24.692
I went with him.

22:24.913 --> 22:28.718
I didn't do any talking.

22:28.738 --> 22:38.592
He said, my God, we took this money out of our own pocket to support research on the crops that we are interested in in Sonora.

22:39.213 --> 22:46.723
He says, I'm not saying that the money was not used for research, but we have no interest

22:47.176 --> 22:55.804
we Sonora farmers in working on Hennequin down in Yucatan or sugarcane in Veracruz.

22:56.985 --> 23:15.883
We wanted for the job that's needed in Sonora and he got a concession from the minister that the monies would be left there and that they would set up a committee elected by all the farmers' organizations.

23:16.910 --> 23:43.187
of the president of the so-called Patronato, a vice president and a secretary treasurer, and then the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture was an ex officio, a member of that committee, and they would sit down with the director of research in Siano, the regional center, and decide how those funds were to be used to make them most

23:43.403 --> 23:48.813
Did you have any input there on how those funds would be used?

23:48.833 --> 23:51.979
Oh, in the beginning, in a general way, yeah.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.524
So they would just ask you if you weren't on the board?

23:55.005 --> 23:55.526
That's right.

23:56.328 --> 23:59.995
And this has been very useful.

24:00.075 --> 24:04.483
As a matter of fact, the publication now is being put out by R. Simmons.

24:05.915 --> 24:10.722
I should say that there are six states that have this organization in Mexico now.

24:11.303 --> 24:15.469
And it protects you from the political winds also.

24:15.489 --> 24:15.690
Right.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.332
It gives great flexibility.

24:18.254 --> 24:25.865
They have a fund that the Director of Research, it's a pretty good sized one for his operational fund.

24:25.905 --> 24:31.954
He'd go down and sign a voucher and get anything the day he orders it locally.

24:31.974 --> 24:35.179
And then once a month the committee meets and clears the book.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.642
Worked wonderfully well.

24:39.324 --> 24:42.147
But how much does a farmer give to this?

24:42.667 --> 24:43.728
It's varied with time.

24:44.429 --> 24:48.693
Originally it used to be, as I recall, 50 centavos.

24:48.713 --> 24:50.655
This was when the peso was worth some money.

24:51.976 --> 24:57.061
But it's... I mean, is there a percentage of his income he's supposed to give?

24:57.121 --> 25:00.345
Like he gives a tenth to the church or something like that?

25:00.385 --> 25:03.748
No, but they change the quota periodically.

25:04.133 --> 25:15.871
I can't even tell you what it is now because of the inflation that's going on and how the adjustments have been made, but it generates a large sum of money.

25:18.474 --> 25:32.976
And these are used mostly for financing today, purchase of equipment, but even for sending scientists to meetings outside the country, all sorts of things.

25:33.209 --> 25:37.876
It gives the director great flexibility in handling things.

25:38.477 --> 25:39.498
Very, very useful.

25:41.100 --> 25:48.611
Then this also, after the disaster, while I'm mentioning it, I think it might fit in here.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.254
You may want to race it again later.

25:53.318 --> 26:01.630
They had contributed this way from, what did I say, 55?

26:02.875 --> 26:32.663
then until about 65 when it had proven itself to be very useful in 65 when that wheat seed was shipped to India and Pakistan that didn't germinate and when Rodolfo Caius heard about this he came storming down to the minister's office and he said this is disgraceful but it's not only happening to

26:33.892 --> 26:46.568
That seed came out of the government seed organization, which was Monopoly, ProNazi, ProDuctora Agricola, Semillas Nacionales.

26:47.349 --> 26:51.395
And he says that's the kind of seed we've been getting very often.

26:52.076 --> 27:00.186
To make a long story short, when we saw it wasn't germinating, we had to double the seeding rate over there, the seed arrived late,

27:00.672 --> 27:04.859
Six weeks late, the war was on between the two countries and it was a mess.

27:05.840 --> 27:11.269
We started planning and we saw in a week that the damn stuff was germinating poorly and were scratching around.

27:11.990 --> 27:19.401
So we had to send telegrams to all the government offices to double the seating rates wherever it was being planted.

27:19.982 --> 27:22.446
I think if it hadn't been for the war, they were too busy at that.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.830
They'd thrown us out of the country.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.933
Yeah.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.605
I wired back the well house to find out what in the hell went wrong.

27:31.606 --> 27:37.575
And, of course, the government seed organization, pro-Nasi, was accusing the shipping line of having fumigated.

27:38.556 --> 27:43.083
But the Minister of Agriculture sent an inspector up to their warehouse.

27:43.123 --> 27:48.731
They came out of Mexicali and took samples out.

27:49.151 --> 27:56.582
It germinated anywhere from 10 to 30 percent over-fumigation in the Mexican government seed warehouses.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.129
Kayese heard about this.

27:58.169 --> 28:03.756
He came storming down to the ministry and he says, you see, that's the kind of seed we get too.

28:03.776 --> 28:05.378
It's not just what goes outside.

28:05.498 --> 28:06.299
It's disgraceful.

28:06.700 --> 28:14.289
He says, we're paying, at that time, it was essentially half of the research money for the wheat program and the corn program in Sonora.

28:15.491 --> 28:17.674
And we want half of the basic seed.

28:17.954 --> 28:20.277
We'll multiply it ourselves.

28:20.898 --> 28:25.584
We'll name technical people to handle it.

28:25.604 --> 28:26.265
And he got it.

28:27.646 --> 28:35.778
That was about the last thing he ever did because he died in Houston with open heart surgery right the next spring.

28:36.439 --> 28:44.030
But I had written to him and told him that despite that disaster with the seed, there was no question this was going to fly.

28:44.090 --> 28:48.096
He got that letter when he was in the hospital about three days before he died.

28:49.177 --> 28:50.539
He was happiest to be.

28:51.441 --> 28:55.847
But if he'd lived one more year, he'd seen the whole thing flying.

28:56.333 --> 29:01.823
But he was very proud of that new research center.

29:01.843 --> 29:08.275
And I expect doubly so because of the disaster of the first one that he'd organized.

29:08.856 --> 29:15.989
There is something I wanted to talk about dealing with culture again in Mexico.

29:16.730 --> 29:20.637
I read that you helped devise a Mexican little 18.

29:21.022 --> 29:22.203
Yes, sir.

29:22.223 --> 29:23.224
Dr. Niederhauser.

29:23.525 --> 29:27.068
How did you get involved in that and why did you get involved in that?

29:27.088 --> 29:28.069
Well, I had a son.

29:28.770 --> 29:31.613
I have only one son, Billy.

29:31.633 --> 29:36.038
And John Niederhauser, our potato scientist, had two sons.

29:37.700 --> 29:43.245
And in 1955, we hit on the idea of start Little League.

29:43.586 --> 29:50.573
So he and I organized the first Little League, the Aztec League in Mexico City in 55.

29:51.346 --> 30:03.887
continued to work with that as long as my, that and as Billy moved to Colt age, established Colt Leagues and, well, Pony first.

30:04.428 --> 30:06.011
Pony and then Colt.

30:06.031 --> 30:06.932
He went through all three.

30:07.673 --> 30:16.408
And I worked with teams, I managed teams for I guess 11, 12 years.

30:16.827 --> 30:19.451
And these were American kids and Mexican kids?

30:19.471 --> 30:20.693
They were all mixed up together.

30:23.537 --> 30:39.961
One of those teams, the last one when Billy was in Little League, I guess it would have been, I don't know, it must have been 60.

30:39.981 --> 30:44.708
It was one of the good teams that I've ever seen.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.626
They won 28 straight games.

30:48.347 --> 30:52.196
They were tough.

30:52.216 --> 30:53.298
Yeah, they must have been.

30:54.701 --> 30:58.729
I wanted to ask about... And the idea was to give the kids something to do.

30:58.950 --> 30:59.471
Oh, sure.

31:00.273 --> 31:05.143
And it became highly popular, you know, spread all over Mexico.

31:06.862 --> 31:17.614
I wanted to ask you, in 1956 Mexico fed itself, it was self-sufficient wheat, but were there any negative aspects about that?

31:17.634 --> 31:19.336
Oh, it depends on where you sit.

31:19.517 --> 31:20.117
Yes.

31:20.137 --> 31:21.118
Would you explain that?

31:21.159 --> 31:28.107
Of course, as was to, we didn't hear much about that in Mexico.

31:30.169 --> 31:32.852
We didn't get all the sophistication that we got.

31:35.110 --> 31:46.684
ten years later in India and Pakistan, when you get all of these clichés that the Green Revolution makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, which is a bunch of nonsense in the first case.

31:47.725 --> 32:00.240
Because they would say that the little farmer couldn't participate, and yet, of course, in Mexico

32:01.216 --> 32:02.639
These wheat spread all over.

32:02.679 --> 32:05.445
Everybody was growing wheat in a few years' time.

32:05.605 --> 32:10.014
The use of fertilizer was harder to implement because of credit.

32:11.397 --> 32:17.790
And you learn from those experiences that we had in Mexico.

32:19.778 --> 32:24.443
used our experience when we got to Pakistan and India to avoid some of the same problems.

32:24.463 --> 32:29.069
But in Mexico, it went without difficulty.

32:29.569 --> 32:38.800
We had the usual noise in the beginning that the Mexican wheats were inferior to the imported ones.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.642
They used to import half of their wheat.

32:43.065 --> 32:49.212
And in the early years, intentionally with the limited budgets, we didn't put in a wheat quality laboratory.

32:49.867 --> 32:59.960
We would take a few samples and send them out for milling and baking to the USDA laboratory in Beltsville and to General Mills in Minneapolis and rely on this.

33:01.221 --> 33:06.488
There was probably 1 20th of the number of samples we should have milled and baked.

33:06.508 --> 33:12.375
But in 56, when we saw we were self-sufficient, then we got the laboratory.

33:12.575 --> 33:17.241
Then we started training people in this also.

33:18.487 --> 33:22.792
actually bring the millers in and show them how to use the weeds right.

33:23.833 --> 33:24.534
We trained people.

33:24.955 --> 33:34.746
Subsequently, many of those technicians, not the scientists, went to the established laboratories in the milling companies and in the bakery.

33:34.766 --> 33:42.435
One of the technicians that's

33:43.040 --> 33:50.411
The head technician today in the biggest bakeries in Mexico came out of this program also.

33:50.431 --> 33:52.554
So they moved all across the line.

33:52.834 --> 34:04.151
Now, Mexico wasn't so sophisticated at that time as in Indian Pakistan when we started moving things like, for example, pricing.

34:07.355 --> 34:12.523
Since Mexico was importing half of the wheat, and I saw that there were abuses very early

34:15.119 --> 34:27.835
by the milling industry, the old mixed types, the farmer in the Bahia, the central area, he was completely unorganized.

34:28.275 --> 34:35.224
Kayes had organized farmers co-ops up in the north, and he could talk to the millers and get a fairer shake.

34:35.664 --> 34:41.852
But the little guys in the central part, they were loners.

34:42.288 --> 34:46.172
milling companies would come and say, oh, we don't want your weight, it's mixed.

34:47.473 --> 34:51.718
Because they'd get an import permit, import U.S.

34:51.758 --> 34:53.039
weight.

34:53.059 --> 35:03.911
And then a couple, three months later, they'd go and offer that guy half or 60% value of what they paid for the import.

35:03.931 --> 35:04.672
Just abuse it.

35:05.893 --> 35:10.658
I could see that by the time we, by 1948, I could see that

35:11.279 --> 35:15.364
Yeah, when we put out a new variety there, we're going to get into the same trouble.

35:16.485 --> 35:23.194
So I went with Farrar to see the Secretary of Agriculture, and I said, look, this abuse is going on.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.698
He said, well, what are we going to do about it?

35:26.718 --> 35:32.325
I said, well, it seems to me that all you have to do is to don't give them any permits.

35:33.419 --> 35:42.952
I need the milling companies unless they buy all of that grain and they pay essentially the price for the international market because it's a small amount anyway that would be blended and mixed.

35:43.252 --> 35:48.700
He used to smoke a pipe and he'd sit there and he said, that sounds pretty reasonable.

35:50.182 --> 35:50.683
And he did.

35:52.445 --> 36:01.317
But by the time we got to India and Pakistan with all of those fancy economists sitting up there and having opinions about everything that was right

36:01.550 --> 36:06.618
holy and economically sound, it was a different ball game.

36:06.638 --> 36:13.648
But in Mexico, we had a minimum of this kind of nonsense.

36:13.668 --> 36:20.118
It was in the next goal where we started running into this.

36:20.138 --> 36:22.041
Well, let's get back to some of the negative things.

36:22.061 --> 36:24.285
Now, you said that that depends on who you talk to.

36:24.425 --> 36:27.810
So, in other words, some of the Millers

36:28.212 --> 36:31.195
Originally, they used to say that our weeds were bad.

36:32.877 --> 36:36.961
Then they become our best supporters.

36:37.962 --> 36:39.303
And what about the poor farmer?

36:39.403 --> 36:47.091
I mean, in order to give this type of production, costs must have gone way up.

36:47.531 --> 36:49.053
Machinery, fertilizer?

36:49.073 --> 36:51.635
No, the same machinery.

36:51.955 --> 36:52.676
Fertilizer.

36:52.696 --> 36:55.519
We had to convince the government that they had to provide

36:55.786 --> 37:07.784
credit for that little guy through the small vehicle bank to give him fertilizer on the credit, which they did.

37:07.804 --> 37:16.396
Of course, the corruptness that was always in that bank probably increased because more money going in, more sticking in the pockets.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.541
But still, it came out in the end.

37:20.643 --> 37:25.590
Also, one other thing that happened

37:26.414 --> 37:48.110
When that little farmer saw the benefits from the fertilizer and the seed, very often he would work out some kind of arrangement on his own for one of the farmers who had some machinery to plant his land for and to even harvest his crop.

37:48.130 --> 37:53.198
Combine harvesting came in fairly early.

37:53.735 --> 38:01.686
So that old stuff about the Green Revolution made the rich richer and the poorer poorer, what would be your response to that?

38:01.726 --> 38:23.016
My response to that would be that if they thought that a technology that increased yield dramatically alone was going to correct all of the social and political evils from the time of Adam and Eve up to the present time, that's pure

38:23.317 --> 38:23.918
nonsense.

38:25.539 --> 38:45.380
The benefits of transfer of benefits from a new technology has to be provided in another way, either through taxes or through credits or a combination of those, taxes and credits and availability of inputs.

38:46.141 --> 38:49.264
If you... To spread those benefits out to the society then?

38:49.284 --> 38:50.045
Sure.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.366
And of course the person that

38:51.970 --> 39:19.767
benefits most in the long run are the consumers in any case, because higher yields, so long as they're achieved with reasonable pricing on inputs and grain, results in more food at less price, and it passes on down to the consumer.

39:21.788 --> 39:28.034
But it was amazing how fast it went to Mexico once it got going.

39:28.375 --> 39:33.280
When we talk about these social benefits, we'll get at it in India and Pakistan.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.681
That's the place to talk about it.

39:35.021 --> 39:36.563
Okay.

39:36.623 --> 39:51.238
According to that Facing Starvation book by Bickel, he says that the same acre that was producing six to ten bushels of grain in 1946 was producing 46 to 60 in 1956.

39:51.758 --> 39:56.284
Is that an accurate statement?

39:56.304 --> 40:00.110
Yeah, in 56, and now in a good year it'll produce.

40:00.630 --> 40:02.132
How big a field is he talking about?

40:02.373 --> 40:05.237
He's saying the same acres producing six or ten.

40:05.337 --> 40:11.085
And now in a good year, in the hands of the best farmers, it'll produce 105, 110.

40:11.345 --> 40:17.614
Is that in the same Mexican areas?

40:18.556 --> 40:21.719
My goodness.

40:22.560 --> 40:36.313
It's even had a greater impact indirectly because these early maturing varieties permit double cropping after wheat.

40:37.374 --> 40:48.225
A summer crop is planted in Sonora under irrigation, the soybeans or sorghum or corn after wheat on the same land.

40:48.610 --> 40:53.356
If it's in Dubai Hill, it'll probably be sordom after wheat.

40:59.404 --> 41:03.389
And this happened in India and Pakistan also, because there's earlier maturing.

41:03.549 --> 41:05.752
See, with the old varieties, you couldn't believe.

41:05.772 --> 41:10.458
Okay, earlier maturing, so now they have enough time to plant another crop.

41:11.740 --> 41:16.626
And with proper fertilization, no problem on depleting the soil.

41:17.281 --> 41:27.652
Same thing's happening now in Argentina with the new early wheat varieties that yield very well at establishing records there also.

41:30.094 --> 41:37.803
In the last three or four years, 6 million tons of soybeans have produced, 80% of them in double crop wheat land.

41:39.204 --> 41:46.832
And the variables here from going to 6 to 10 bushels per acre to 105 to 110 are

41:47.453 --> 41:51.857
A variety will set the ceiling, how high you can go.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.079
Yeah, the variety is the, okay.

41:54.099 --> 41:57.341
Then the fertility, soil fertility.

41:57.501 --> 41:57.722
Right.

41:57.982 --> 42:01.385
Proper use of the right kind of fertilizer.

42:01.405 --> 42:05.008
Proper, if it's irrigation, proper timing of water.

42:05.969 --> 42:08.090
Control of weeds.

42:08.110 --> 42:13.075
And then built in, mostly in the case of wheat, is the disease resistance.

42:13.275 --> 42:13.455
Right.

42:13.855 --> 42:15.937
We don't have many insect problems on wheat.

42:15.957 --> 42:17.038
Once in a while you have to.

42:17.457 --> 42:20.060
control a nasal problem, but very rare.

42:21.482 --> 42:37.523
And then, of course, the economics, price of the input, price of the fertilizer, credit for the little guy to buy it, and then the price at harvest that reflects the international price for that commodity.

42:37.543 --> 42:43.431
And did you attempt, now that you're bringing about this spectacular increase in production, did you attempt

42:44.086 --> 42:54.015
or did someone in the Rockefeller Foundation attempt to get the Mexican government to bring about these credits for the little guy?

42:55.597 --> 43:07.608
So, the Rockefeller Foundation itself was, in a sense then, attempting to get the Mexican government to set out what we have in America here, you know, like the farm banks.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.469
Yeah, indirectly.

43:09.489 --> 43:12.372
It was done informally.

43:13.027 --> 43:21.655
In those early days when we talked, every couple months with the minister, about these problems, just informally.

43:21.715 --> 43:39.912
And then through these farmers' co-ops, through CAIS, every once in a while, when they were dealing on, before planting, on the price for the grain for the next harvest, he would tell the government purchasing agent, I want Morlog here sitting in on this.

43:43.199 --> 43:47.505
I might not say very much, but if he wanted some information, he'd turn to me.

43:47.986 --> 43:58.981
But later it was like I was kind of an uncle to both of them, both the government grain buying agency as well as Farmers' Co-op, but no official title.

44:00.203 --> 44:02.486
This is what happens, you see, with credibility.

44:02.506 --> 44:04.729
It's very important in me.

44:04.749 --> 44:12.480
Once you've established your confidence, personal credibility, and they know that you're for the

44:12.663 --> 44:19.173
good of the general public, and that you're a friend.

44:20.495 --> 44:26.043
You can do many things that probably their best national can't do.

44:27.225 --> 44:29.909
It's incredible how this works.

44:29.929 --> 44:30.570
Kind of frightening.

44:34.876 --> 44:39.463
And that's why these short-term assignments are not very effective.

44:39.865 --> 44:43.171
USAID was moving their people every two or three years.

44:43.211 --> 44:51.786
You could never establish this credibility at the grassroots level and at the government level.

44:51.946 --> 44:56.254
And if you were in charge of it, how would you change that?

44:58.225 --> 45:00.467
10 or 20 years to complete?

45:00.487 --> 45:09.796
Yes, but since USAID programs are under State Department regulations, they shift their people, and so this is the way it goes in USAID.

45:10.457 --> 45:12.900
But it puts great limitations on the effectiveness.

45:15.022 --> 45:25.532
But they may, I was talking to some of the directors about this just last week, or two weeks ago.

45:26.035 --> 45:28.719
relating to forestry programs of theirs.

45:29.460 --> 45:41.317
And I said, well, at least can't you keep them in the same region, even if you shift them to countries, so that they're in the same cultural setup and sometimes linguistic?

45:41.337 --> 45:43.801
And they said, well, maybe we can find the flexibility there.

45:48.888 --> 45:54.696
You're bringing about a tremendous change in productivity in northern Mexico.

45:54.716 --> 45:55.958
How did the press deal with you?

45:57.727 --> 45:58.708
The Mexican press.

45:58.909 --> 45:59.429
Originally?

46:01.873 --> 46:11.987
Well, in the early times, of course, there would be certain individuals there that are ideologically anti-American.

46:12.207 --> 46:12.908
Oh, yeah.

46:12.928 --> 46:15.332
And because of the histories of the countries.

46:15.372 --> 46:22.502
And once in a while there was one person in particular who used to pour out

46:23.140 --> 46:27.748
He's still around in government service, but he doesn't make much noise anymore.

46:30.313 --> 46:34.200
And there's a different change, even in those who do this.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.062
But he was a newspaper man?

46:35.262 --> 46:36.424
He was a newspaper man?

46:36.484 --> 46:39.991
No, he was a government employee, but he used to be a freelance writer at the same time.

46:41.894 --> 46:42.475
Oh, I see.

46:42.495 --> 46:47.224
Generally, the newspaper men, I never had very much trouble with.

46:48.014 --> 46:51.038
After I got to a point where I speak Spanish fairly well.

46:54.301 --> 47:00.549
The one thing you have to be careful with in Latin America, I think it's in general in the developing nations.

47:00.569 --> 47:03.552
The press is very young and inexperienced.

47:03.833 --> 47:05.655
And so you have to have great patience.

47:05.695 --> 47:12.623
And when you're talking about a point, you've got to approach it from about five different directions so that you're sure they understand it.

47:13.484 --> 47:16.688
With a veteran reporter, you can go pretty fast.

47:17.056 --> 47:21.830
They'll pick the grain out from the chaff.

47:22.432 --> 47:26.003
But with young people, you've got to have really a lot of...
