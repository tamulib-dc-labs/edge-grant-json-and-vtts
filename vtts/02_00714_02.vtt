is not a degree that is very narrow in scope that he 
can only work in one industry. I think there is

00:06.327 --> 00:14.856
always going to be a need for drilling wells and 
producing fluid from wells. And so the education

00:14.876 --> 00:24.587
that the students that we're calling petroleum 
engineer today get is going to be something that

00:14.876 --> 00:24.587
they'll be able to use for their entire lifetime. 
And there is some question I've had a lot of

00:25.765 --> 00:29.270
students ask. Am I getting into a field that five 
years from now is going to be outdated like a

00:29.290 --> 00:34.158
railroad engineer? Well, the answer to that is no.

00:41.168 --> 00:43.031
Is there any other comments you need to make? Oh, I 
think that's about it. I appreciate you taking the

00:45.034 --> 00:47.217
time to talk with me.
