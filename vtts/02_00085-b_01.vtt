WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:05.451
Now the second.

00:07.497 --> 00:11.389
You remember going to your first football game as a 
student? Oh, I do indeed. What was a football game

00:12.373 --> 00:15.643
weekend like?

00:18.796 --> 00:21.860
It's what you live for in 1976, Haskell. Our 
football fortunes had changed dramatically from

00:21.880 --> 00:30.493
those days when I accompanied my father up here in 
the late 60s and early 70s. So much so that in 1976,

00:31.434 --> 00:43.251
we were ranked in the top 25 and regarded as a real 
power, defensively particularly, and favored in

00:31.434 --> 00:43.251
most of the games that we played. We were playing 
Kansas State in the fall of 1976, And it was well

00:49.019 --> 00:52.484
over 100 degrees at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. 
Most of our games kicked off at 1 o'clock.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.171
Incredibly humid, bright, sunshiny day. And I had 
a date. And in those days, you just didn't go to a

01:00.355 --> 01:08.167
football game with a date without buying her a mum, 
an Aggie mum. Quite a tradition. And it was almost a

01:10.889 --> 01:24.182
package for a weekend that if you had a date to the 
game, you almost had to figure out what you were

01:10.889 --> 01:24.182
going to do on Friday night, Saturday morning, the 
game, and then Saturday night. It wasn't just, do

01:24.303 --> 01:28.493
you want to go to the game? It was quite a dilemma to 
figure out, you know, what are we going to do Friday

01:28.473 --> 01:36.281
night and Saturday and, you know. But it was also 
great anticipation. What did you all do on those

01:40.185 --> 01:42.387
nights? We tried to find someplace you could go eat 
dinner and go to a movie. There weren't many

01:47.793 --> 01:52.978
choices for either.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.920
You do it like you do now. In a lot of ways, you'd find 
a group of people and go somewhere and eat and then

01:55.000 --> 02:06.293
do a movie, and it was all building up to obviously 
the Midnight Yale practice. And the big question

02:07.074 --> 02:10.457
was, you know, when the lights go out, this is your 
first date. Are you gonna kiss this girl for the

02:10.497 --> 02:12.960
first time in Kyle Field? You know, and you did on 
occasion. And then on Saturday you'd buy the mum

02:16.364 --> 02:32.809
and meet her parents or she'd meet yours or 
something and go to the game together and stand

02:16.364 --> 02:32.809
three and a half hours and then have to decide if you 
needed to shower before you went out or whether or

02:16.364 --> 02:32.809
not you were just going to go out right after the 
game. Where did the out of town young ladies spend

02:33.029 --> 02:36.955
the nights? I don't know, really, because I don't 
remember ever dating a girl other than a girl that

02:36.935 --> 02:47.713
came up from Laredo who stayed with another girl in 
a dormitory. But most of the time I didn't have

02:47.753 --> 02:51.038
that. And you had a car. I did. So that getting 
around wasn't a problem. Correct. I didn't access

02:57.031 --> 03:00.356
that car Monday through Friday most weeks. And if 
you were on midnight yell practice, it was

03:00.977 --> 03:13.316
actually held at midnight, and what did students 
do after midnight yell practice? Where'd you go?

03:14.918 --> 03:22.770
The International House of Pancakes and Taco Bell 
were the two most prominent hangouts after

03:24.168 --> 03:40.799
midnight Yale practice and I think some of it had to 
do with the amount of beer that you'd had that

03:24.168 --> 03:40.799
evening or what have you because it seemed to 
promote a level of an appetite that you just had to

03:24.168 --> 03:40.799
go cater to at 12 45 or one o'clock. I can remember at 
Taco Bell standing in line for over an hour But it

03:48.248 --> 03:57.504
was almost a secondary party because the parking 
lot at Taco Bell would be just a gathering of four,

03:48.248 --> 03:57.504
five, 600 Aggies. And was it normal to ask a girl for 
a date for the whole weekend? Yes, indeed it was. I

04:04.997 --> 04:06.780
think that was just an expectation. Now I did have a 
roommate that thought that was the case for him,

04:07.233 --> 04:21.408
and on a tough weekend and I had to console him, he 
found out that no, she had just agreed to go to the

04:07.233 --> 04:21.408
game with him and that was it. No Yale practice, no 
Friday night, no Saturday night, no lunch before

04:21.668 --> 04:26.393
the game, no nothing. Do you remember any examples

04:27.474 --> 04:36.143
of somebody that you knew? that went to yell 
practice with a young lady who did not know about

04:36.123 --> 04:42.037
the kiss.

04:45.405 --> 04:46.287
Yeah, I do. In fact, she had been told about it and 
didn't believe it. And I guess thought it was just

04:53.082 --> 04:58.407
some more of this Aggie lore that she had heard 
about. She was from Austin. And her date was rather

05:00.369 --> 05:07.355
shy and quiet about telling her about this 
tradition, but the rest of us were not. And on

05:08.115 --> 05:22.228
Friday night we kept telling her, that was one 
thing that Aggies love to do and they'll always

05:08.115 --> 05:22.228
love to do, is talk about the traditions at A&M and 
what's going to happen and how great it is to march

05:08.115 --> 05:22.228
in behind the band and lose your shoes and when the 
lights go out you better be ready. I guess she

05:23.828 --> 05:28.233
didn't think that it was going to happen, but we 
marched in behind the band. I don't remember her

05:28.633 --> 05:48.956
losing a shoe, but the lights went out and this shy, 
rather reserved young 19-year-old boy grabbed

05:28.633 --> 05:48.956
her and

05:28.633 --> 05:48.956
she bought into it for a few seconds and then 
collected herself and said, wait a minute, I

05:28.633 --> 05:48.956
didn't agree to that. But it was rather fun. Then on 
Saturday morning what was the routine? The

05:59.959 --> 06:13.022
routine was always sleep late, hang around the 
dorm, talk about the game, figure out if you didn't

05:59.959 --> 06:13.022
have a date what you were really going to do, but if 
you did have a date you had to plan your day because,

06:13.458 --> 06:31.685
believe it or not, mums sometimes were sold out by 
11 a.m. And I can remember going somewhere and

06:13.458 --> 06:31.685
finding somebody that was selling mums on some 
street, coming back to the dorm and putting them in

06:13.458 --> 06:31.685
the refrigerator, and then taking them with me to 
go pick up my date. It was kind of an interesting

06:32.527 --> 06:34.690
situation when you had a date who lived on campus 
and you know on a real hot day you wouldn't go get

06:35.868 --> 06:57.555
your car to drive over to Mosier Hall so I can 
remember hauling that mum across campus and by the

06:35.868 --> 06:57.555
time I arrived at Mosier Hall you know just being 
hot and sweaty and my mum being almost wilted And

06:58.312 --> 07:00.635
here I am just ready to go on a date. But that was just 
part of it. By the 70s, was the number of coeds

07:03.498 --> 07:16.955
beginning to be large enough that the typical 
Aggie who was looking for a date was quite often

07:03.498 --> 07:16.955
able to get one? I wouldn't say quite often, but 
certainly able. And I also would say that a lot of

07:21.741 --> 07:24.825
guys still had high school sweethearts that came 
to A&M, you know, on weekends. But yeah, I'd say you

07:29.774 --> 07:32.418
could find a date pretty easily. Later in the year, 
were we still bringing Tessies up on the train or

07:33.460 --> 07:37.528
the bus? No. That had ended. That had ended. And 
let's see, what did we, was it Aggie Sweetheart? So

07:45.663 --> 07:48.046
that had terminated.

07:51.329 --> 08:01.300
Going home to Laredo, was there any routine or any 
ritual about giving rides to guys and signing up

07:51.329 --> 08:01.300
and so forth? Yeah, there was. Because Laredo was 
such a long way and there were so many cities en

08:02.521 --> 08:14.995
route, it was quite often the case that a guy from 
San Marcos, New Braunfels, San Antonio,

08:16.038 --> 08:25.031
Pearsall, Divine, Cthulhu, and Laredo of course 
wanted a ride. And that was not a problem at all.

08:27.274 --> 08:36.527
Most of the time it was a Laredo person because 
that's a long trip and not the gas expensive Was it

08:36.507 --> 08:38.270
normal for them to share? Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, it was. 
But I didn't go home a lot, to be honest with you. I

08:43.720 --> 08:45.322
enjoyed deer hunting. I enjoyed Thanksgiving. 
But other than a lot of buddies saying, why don't we

08:47.967 --> 08:54.178
go to Laredo this weekend, I didn't necessarily 
feel the need to go home. Do you remember any, in

08:54.158 --> 09:01.008
your first year here, do you remember any 
significant out-of-town trips for anything

08:54.158 --> 09:01.008
other than home? Oh yes, oh yes, yeah. A lot of away 
games. We'd go to Baylor and U of H and Rice, a lot of

09:04.113 --> 09:08.720
the old Southwest Conference venues. That was 
always popular. We'd always load up and have a road

09:10.582 --> 09:13.166
trip. I distinctively remember in the fall of 
1978, when a lot of us had just gotten our rings, we

09:17.092 --> 09:20.957
made a road trip to Houston. We were playing rice 
and one of our Houston dorm buddies was having a

09:20.977 --> 09:28.107
party at his house. And in a caravan leaving town 
near Navasota, we started launching aluminum

09:30.170 --> 09:39.964
cans at each other, empty aluminum cans. It was 
quite popular to just roll down your window about

09:40.465 --> 09:45.732
four inches and put the open end of the empty 
aluminum can in the window. And when you'd flick

09:49.712 --> 09:56.301
the switch or roll it down another quarter of an 
inch, the suction would catch it and just jettison

09:49.712 --> 09:56.301
it. And when that got to be too laborious, it was 
just quicker, easier, and sometimes more

09:58.524 --> 10:10.661
accurate to throw a can at a friend's car. I 
remember Mark Martin, Class 79, Volkswagen

10:15.715 --> 10:25.110
Beetle in the car ahead of us, throw in that can, and 
the look on his face, he was just in the other lane,

10:15.715 --> 10:25.110
just went stark white. Because here came the can, 
and I didn't see it, but right behind it apparently

10:25.931 --> 10:30.719
was his Aggie ring. And about when we pulled over, 
they pulled over, and we all, two cars backed up,

10:33.123 --> 10:42.297
but within an hour Haskell, there were probably 15 
cars pulled over because we had to find his Aggie

10:44.032 --> 10:53.404
ring. And I'm going to guess there were 45, maybe 50 
people on that median looking for an Aggie ring,

10:53.424 --> 11:00.914
which we found. All right. Your mention of Aggie 
rings, describe your feelings and so forth when

11:03.177 --> 11:09.806
you got your ring. Great anticipation. Excuse me. 
I had thought about staying at A&M for summer

11:13.681 --> 11:21.071
school when I ordered my ring, and I did not. My 
college roommate from Lake Jackson who was a scene

11:21.912 --> 11:34.869
cadet talked to me about a course that we had both 
had trouble with at A&M that was offered at Laredo

11:21.912 --> 11:34.869
Junior College and would transfer. So he 
suggested that we both go to Laredo Junior College

11:34.929 --> 11:41.157
that summer. We did, and we had a big time. We lived 
in a little garage apartment at our house and went

11:43.982 --> 11:51.630
to Laredo Junior College. But that summer is when I 
got my ring. And it was rather unceremonious in

11:55.875 --> 12:03.683
nature because I ordered it in the spring and it 
came in a box at home in the summer. And it was just

12:04.464 --> 12:05.125
me. It was delivered and there it was. Do you 
remember anybody you proudly showed it to first?

12:11.696 --> 12:12.598
Oh, just everybody. My mother was the first one I 
showed it to. My dad knew that I'd gotten it in a

12:16.367 --> 12:22.362
phone call and then he came home and, of course, I 
think that was a very proud moment for him. What did

12:22.382 --> 12:23.344
it cost? $112.50. It cost $110 and then $2.50 to 
ship it to Laredo. Have you since then had any Aggie

12:33.074 --> 12:38.020
ring stories where you lost a door? Yes. I worked 
for Hughes Tool Company when I graduated from A&M

12:38.720 --> 12:43.866
selling rock bits in the oil field. And in Brenham, 
Texas on a very cold, cold January day in 1980, I

12:50.594 --> 12:57.863
looked down while I was jetting up a rock bit on a 
Clayton Williams' own rig, I might add. My ring was

12:59.284 --> 13:00.165
not there. And in the great expanse of a location, 
as they're known for an oil drilling site, I had no

13:02.128 --> 13:12.019
idea where that ring was. But I couldn't have been 
more fortunate. The company man for Clayton

13:19.973 --> 13:24.800
Williams was indeed an Aggie, class of 64, I think. 
And he didn't exactly shut the rig down, but any

13:26.142 --> 13:36.278
able-bodied person that was not on duty was 
assigned to find that ring. And we never found it

13:39.150 --> 13:53.992
that day, but the next day I drove up on location and 
one of the rig workers said, you need to go to Mr.

13:39.150 --> 13:53.992
Johnson's trailer, he's got something for you. 
And I knew exactly what it was. And there it was,

13:55.815 --> 13:57.177
he'd found my ring. All right, do you have any ring 
stories about it being recognized somewhere far

13:57.677 --> 14:03.105
away? Yes, yes I do. And I don't remember the 
fellow's name, but it was when I was field

14:04.287 --> 14:08.512
director, and this is a great story. It was a young 
Aggie who was with one of the big oil companies, and

14:10.054 --> 14:24.311
he was assigned to the Middle East as a last-minute 
assignment. And typically, I understand, you go

14:25.352 --> 14:33.822
through some kind of orientation to the Middle 
East culture when you're permanently assigned

14:25.352 --> 14:33.822
there. He was somewhat of a fill-in. And it wasn't a 
bar, but it was some type of coffee tea house.

14:44.652 --> 15:11.807
restaurant i'm not sure and

14:44.652 --> 15:11.807
the only reason this female was in there is that she 
was the daughter of the proprietor and normally

14:44.652 --> 15:11.807
apparently not a lot of females would frequent 
this place without some reason such as their

14:44.652 --> 15:11.807
spouse or whatever they didn't go in there on their 
own but this was a rather apparently attractive

14:44.652 --> 15:11.807
younger female And my friend made her 
acquaintance and tried to engage her in

15:12.867 --> 15:18.715
conversation. She did not speak English, but he 
thought she was attractive and that maybe she

15:18.795 --> 15:23.562
would go out with him. And the father caught wind of 
this and watched it, and within a matter of

15:24.904 --> 15:35.078
minutes, police were hauling him out of the 
establishment. And he didn't know what was going

15:36.543 --> 15:38.306
on. All he tried to do was talk to this young lady. 
He'd been there all of about 24 hours. Well, he put

15:44.275 --> 15:51.987
up resistance, and as he got to the door and they 
were hauling him out, he threw his arms against the

15:44.275 --> 15:51.987
jams of the door. And they pulled his left arm, and 
his raggy ring was on his right hand, and he held on

15:52.989 --> 16:00.340
and he swept the door jamb as they hauled him out. 
Fortunately his ring made noise and he made noise

16:01.096 --> 16:21.231
and one of the patrons in the establishment saw 
that hand and saw that ring and within an hour or so

16:01.096 --> 16:21.231
was at the police station or whatever it was and was 
taking care of him and it was a high-ranking

16:21.211 --> 16:26.578
official with Aramco, who was a fight in Texas 
Aggie. And he said, son, I'm here to get you out, but

16:27.399 --> 16:33.667
let me explain a few things to you about the Middle 
East. And so I thought that was an interesting

16:33.687 --> 16:36.291
Aggie ring story. As far as you're aware, what 
other institutions have as much tradition about

16:36.311 --> 16:46.324
rings as A&M? None to our level, Haskell. None to 
our level. And I have great familiarity with that.

16:54.294 --> 17:03.418
But I would have to admit that there are those such 
as the service academies or even the Citadel that

16:54.294 --> 17:03.418
take great pride to the extent that maybe 100% of 
those eligible do order and wear class rings. That

17:10.787 --> 17:13.870
was never the case in the Southwest Conference. 
It's not the case with most major institutions.

17:17.974 --> 17:21.657
It's just not a coveted keepsake. As far as I'm 
aware, the academies, VMI Citadel, maybe

17:22.738 --> 17:31.026
Clemson, A few Ivy League-type schools, both in 
the East, maybe Stanford, a little bit Rice, I

17:32.018 --> 17:41.336
think, and so forth. But I think most other schools 
have let it slip badly. Let's see. Did celebrities

17:51.376 --> 17:57.487
who came to visit the campus while you were here, 
any famous people? Yes. Ronald Reagan came here on

17:58.148 --> 18:04.139
a campaign swing in the fall of 1979. I shook his 
hand in the MSC. I told him I was going to vote for

18:07.726 --> 18:11.212
him, that I hoped he became president of the United 
States. Steve Martin, the comedian, came here,

18:13.315 --> 18:19.185
and I happened to just be standing somewhere when 
he just walked right by me. And it was on the east

18:19.746 --> 18:23.672
side of G. Raleigh White. I didn't know who he was. 
He was dressed in a T-shirt and blue jeans. What did

18:27.358 --> 18:29.702
he describe him physically? He was about my height 
and had gray hair and I wouldn't have known it was

18:36.127 --> 18:38.020
him if he hadn't said hello. Guess what? His 
hometown, Waco. Is that right? Doesn't fit, does

18:43.503 --> 18:44.464
it? No, I didn't know. He doesn't seem like my 
impression of Waco. Linda Ronstadt came here when

18:48.429 --> 18:51.553
I was a freshman, and I thought that was big time. 
But I'd have to say that my biggest celebrity, or

18:51.573 --> 18:57.640
the guy that I remember the most, was Bob Hope. Came 
here on a Friday night before a home football game,

18:58.281 --> 19:01.625
and I had a date to it. And I remember Tom Wilson 
presenting Bob Hope with an Aggie jersey that had

19:06.772 --> 19:11.745
12 on it, and that was a big deal. Was this in G. 
Raleigh? Yes, it was. Describe a basketball, an

19:17.019 --> 19:20.688
Aggie basketball game. Oh, yes. Can I call you 
back? Okay, thank you. Those were frenzied

19:26.870 --> 19:37.487
atmospheres in the days of, oh I don't know, 
whatever G. Raleigh accommodated, seven, eight

19:26.870 --> 19:37.487
thousand, nine thousand maybe for basketball. It 
helped that we had a very successful program and

19:37.507 --> 19:45.300
that we'd won the Southwest Conference I think in 
75 and in 76 before I got here. But a ticket to a home

19:45.938 --> 19:50.745
basketball game was really a premium around here. 
And sometimes, even with a sports pass, you lined

19:51.786 --> 19:59.216
up two hours before a game, you read the battalion, 
and you did not throw it away. Because in my junior

20:00.057 --> 20:12.975
year, a group of us started just by default, once 
again, a tradition that I hope still carries on of

20:00.057 --> 20:12.975
reading the battalion while the opposing team is 
being introduced.

20:18.003 --> 20:23.933
We didn't have necessarily a basketball band, we 
had the full band in G. Wally White. So the

20:24.694 --> 20:33.388
atmosphere was not only frenzied, it was loud, it 
was interactive with the team, everybody knew who

20:24.694 --> 20:33.388
everybody was, it was just a great atmosphere. 
What did you guys think about our coach then? Oh, we

20:36.243 --> 20:36.864
loved him. Everybody loved him. He was one of us. 
You know, he wasn't Dr. Shelby Metcalf. He was an

20:44.457 --> 20:50.207
Aggie and related well and just always had time for 
people. Great guy. And you all didn't make any

20:51.650 --> 20:55.354
noise during the game. Oh, gosh, no. No, we were 
quiet as church mice, but no. Indeed, we did. Do you

21:00.200 --> 21:04.345
remember going to Silver Taps? Yes, I do. Bond 
recollections. What was your impression the

21:07.028 --> 21:08.890
first time? Well, it was one of, this is why I came 
here. This galvanizes my feelings about A&M. I

21:19.335 --> 21:21.499
didn't know any of the deceased. I think there were 
three kids or four kids, car accident victims. I

21:28.089 --> 21:36.743
didn't know any of them, but it didn't matter 
because at 10-15 everybody in Moore Hall was

21:28.089 --> 21:36.743
turning out lights and going to silver taps. 
Everybody. Nobody was going to stay behind

21:38.324 --> 21:42.929
because they had to study, or they were on the phone 
with their parents or their girlfriend. Lights

21:44.310 --> 21:51.957
were out, and if you tried to stay back, you had some 
challenges, no matter what your reasoning was.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.799
Did you go to Muster as a student? I did, oh yes, very 
much so. Describe Muster in those days. Moving,

21:59.844 --> 22:02.706
but not... Where was it held? In G. Raleigh-White.

22:06.828 --> 22:13.754
I don't remember it just being an all-inclusive, 
got to go to Muster. Silver Taps was more the

22:14.355 --> 22:20.600
emotional

22:14.355 --> 22:20.600
commanding activity. Muster was more, if I don't 
have anything else to do, I'll go. It just didn't

22:26.365 --> 22:35.333
have the, for me at least, or for the dorm 
atmosphere, it didn't have the anticipation, the

22:26.365 --> 22:35.333
buildup that, you know, at 5.30 we got to be in G. 
Raleigh for Muster. And Bonfire, describe it and

22:36.443 --> 22:42.208
any activities you and your buddies. Well, I 
worked on Bonfire. Bonfire was much like it is

22:43.469 --> 22:50.476
today, an anticipated semester-long activity. 
There were some times when if you didn't

22:52.698 --> 23:06.450
necessarily have the familiarity with the 
culture of Bonfire, you could have been

22:52.698 --> 23:06.450
ostracized a little bit because you didn't 
respect the perimeter or the red pots or the the

23:06.430 --> 23:15.688
protocol that they assigned to the bonfire that 
given day or that week, whether it was push or what

23:06.430 --> 23:15.688
have you. There was a lot of animosity in my days 
regarding bonfire between the band and the Red

23:15.708 --> 23:23.764
Pots and the yell leaders. As to who ceremoniously 
was in charge of yell practice the night Bonfire

23:23.744 --> 23:41.481
burned, because the Red Pots had built it, and the 
band was marching around Bonfire, but yet the yell

23:23.744 --> 23:41.481
leaders took center stage. So it was kind of a 
triumvirate. Now where was it held? On Duncan

23:46.346 --> 23:47.107
Field. And what did you, did you work on it your 
first year? I did. I had no choice. In Moore Hall at

23:53.393 --> 24:01.626
about my first experience with bonfire was an axe 
handle on my door saying, get up or else and let's

23:53.393 --> 24:01.626
go. And where was the cutting area, do you 
remember? Just south of Navasota, just on the

24:04.551 --> 24:08.237
other side of Navasota towards Houston. And you as 
a newcomer,

24:08.497 --> 24:16.650
were you treated like a fish in bonfire? No, I was 
treated like a frog, which is worse. Okay. Which is

24:19.359 --> 24:20.102
worse. And so your part was to help cut? Yes, sir, 
and I had to wear a white piece adhesive tape on my

24:25.861 --> 24:32.331
blue jeans, and I pinched my left finger and almost 
broke my right finger. Did indeed break it. But

24:35.837 --> 24:39.743
great camaraderie, you know, a great cause, it 
seemed like. We were there for, you know, once you

24:40.264 --> 24:44.270
got into it, you took great pride in it. The fall of 
76 is what I regarded as my bonfire, technically.

24:48.857 --> 24:52.543
About when in the fall did you all start working on 
it? About the first week school started,

24:53.519 --> 25:03.341
actually, we had a bonfire crew chief in our dorm, 
and we had a meeting about the second week of school

24:53.519 --> 25:03.341
and told us all about bonfire and what it meant. And 
so during a typical week, how much time did you

25:03.581 --> 25:08.232
spend? Not hardly at all. More on Sunday mornings. 
Sunday morning. Sunday morning was a significant

25:12.340 --> 25:20.051
cut day and then evening Sunday afternoon was a day 
you worked on Bonfire. It wasn't an everyday deal.

25:23.255 --> 25:32.368
How many weeks before Bonfire did you and your 
buddies get to quit working in the cut area?

25:33.209 --> 25:41.455
Probably about a month out, about the middle of 
October, something like that. And the stack, I

25:41.475 --> 25:43.843
never worked on the stack. Was there, in the 
cutting area, were there both civilian and corps

25:44.397 --> 25:48.085
students? Oh, indeed there was, yes. And people 
may argue with this, but there was a female who

25:49.548 --> 25:56.381
actually was in the cutting area when I was there. 
And so what did you and your friends think about

25:58.185 --> 26:02.434
that? What were your feelings as the bonfire was 
ignited? Well, mine were generated by a lot of

26:06.098 --> 26:14.748
pride in the fall of 76 because I had my girlfriend 
from Laredo up here. I had friends who had gone to

26:15.449 --> 26:25.060
other schools visiting and a friend from the 
University of Texas was over here. Bonfire was two

26:26.521 --> 26:31.667
days before the game that year because we were 
playing in Austin. my first bonfire. And so these

26:34.490 --> 26:38.615
people came up and then we went home to Laredo. But I 
felt like more of a host and in showing off this

26:38.695 --> 26:47.705
magnificent bonfire to friends and family. So it 
was tremendous pride. What are the events and or

26:50.748 --> 26:58.937
activities that contribute significantly to 
Aggie spirit?

27:01.600 --> 27:13.841
Haskell, I'd have to point back again to, 
unfortunately,

27:01.600 --> 27:13.841
maybe tragic situations that bring Aggies 
together. Silver taps, I'd say, had more of an

27:13.881 --> 27:19.271
impact on me. When people ask the question, You 
know, what does it mean to be an Aggie? I suspect

27:24.838 --> 27:29.164
there's 245,000 variations of that. But I'd also 
have to recall hundreds, maybe thousands, of

27:30.866 --> 27:43.343
speeches I've heard when people go to a podium and 
say something and then refer to it. That's what

27:43.423 --> 27:46.187
being an Aggie is all about. To me, being an Aggie is 
about one thing and one thing only, pride. Now,

27:52.776 --> 28:00.887
your interpretation of what makes up that pride is 
certainly open for individual interpretation.

28:01.468 --> 28:08.417
But to conclusively say that's what being an Aggie 
is all about, I'd have to say pride is the only word

28:01.468 --> 28:08.417
that comes to my mind. And I was proud of my fellow 
Aggies when I went to Silver Taps, that everywhere

28:08.918 --> 28:15.567
you look, there's Aggies. Are there some other 
activities and or events that contribute to that

28:16.002 --> 28:20.450
pride? Oh, I think there are indeed. I think Aggies 
helping Aggies is a tradition that's never

28:22.514 --> 28:26.101
promoted. It's not one that shows up in a handbook. 
It's not one that anybody refers to as a distinct

28:32.112 --> 28:37.302
tradition, but it underlies every tradition we 
have. I think the old adage about Aggies hiring

28:39.416 --> 28:47.344
Aggies is probably somewhat accurate. But I 
really believe that the camaraderie that came

28:47.944 --> 28:58.494
from our military background manifested itself 
into a tradition of Aggies just help Aggies.

28:58.634 --> 28:59.434
That's just what you do. They're family. And if 
you've got a ring and somebody else got a ring,

29:00.555 --> 29:03.458
that's an instant bond. And all those things that 
go with what being an Aggie means to them. But

29:07.842 --> 29:11.687
ultimately, I want to say that summarily it's 
pride. As

29:13.790 --> 29:30.511
you look back,

29:13.790 --> 29:30.511
what did A&M do for you as a student that proved to be 
significant for you later? You'll find this

29:31.372 --> 29:32.694
interesting, I hope. When I came to A&M in the fall 
of 1976, I was a relatively shy introvert.

29:42.258 --> 30:00.580
Although I'd been involved on a very limited basis 
in high school and particularly with my Future

29:42.258 --> 30:00.580
Farmers of America involvement, I was not one to 
get into everything and join clubs and run for

29:42.258 --> 30:00.580
office and so on and so forth. I think what A&M did 
for me was establish a level of self-esteem,

30:01.387 --> 30:09.863
self-confidence, a level of involvement. It's 
what I talked about when we first started this

30:09.883 --> 30:12.067
interview. It was an atmosphere of welcome. 
You're expected to be involved, and no matter what

30:16.455 --> 30:23.749
you have to contribute, get involved. It served me 
well because when I graduated from A&M I was not

30:23.729 --> 30:35.033
necessarily shy, but I'd overcome a lot of that 
introvert nature. I think one of the big concerns

30:35.053 --> 30:41.907
today ought to be the worry about how today it may be 
easy for a kid to go off by him or herself and not get

30:42.781 --> 30:51.177
involved in anything. No doubt about it. When you 
consider 30,000 plus students who live off

30:52.259 --> 30:59.251
campus, that's a legitimate concern. Yeah, yeah. 
In those days, as you said, you There was no way you

31:03.132 --> 31:07.741
could have avoided certain things. Let's see, 
some Aggie indulgences during that day. What did

31:15.056 --> 31:19.705
the typical student drink or smoke? I didn't run 
around with anybody.
