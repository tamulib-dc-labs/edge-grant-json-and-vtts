WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:08.695
My

00:02.950 --> 00:08.695
name is Phillip S. Smith. I go by Phil. I have 
initially joined Mitchell Energy and

00:11.117 --> 00:21.806
Development Corp., which is the parent company of 
the Woodlands Corporation, in January of 1980.

00:23.688 --> 00:32.856
Prior to that time, I was a partner with Arthur 
Anderson & Co. here in Houston, Texas. I initially

00:32.988 --> 00:50.149
joined Mitchell as the Senior Vice President, 
Chief Financial Officer, and reported to Joe

00:32.988 --> 00:50.149
Williams, who was President of the 
Administration and Finance Division at the time.

00:51.531 --> 01:00.362
Subsequent to Joe Williams leaving, I assumed the 
position of the President of the Administration

00:51.531 --> 01:00.362
and Financial Division. of Mitchell Energy and 
Development Corp., which basically encompasses

01:01.237 --> 01:22.671
all of the non-operating aspects of the Mitchell 
companies, such as finance, accounting,

01:01.237 --> 01:22.671
administration, data processing, public 
relations, anything not directly related to

01:01.237 --> 01:22.671
operations. Do you have the legal office as well? 
Pardon? The legal office, you had that as well?

01:28.061 --> 01:31.485
Legal, yes, legal would fall in that category.

01:38.954 --> 01:54.312
Since that time, that was, I forget exactly when 
Joe Williams left, but probably 81 or so, I would

01:38.954 --> 01:54.312
imagine, 1981, I guess, perhaps late 1980. As a 
result of those functions, all of those functions

01:54.950 --> 02:15.507
to the extent they're provided across the board to 
the entire Mitchell Energy and Development

01:54.950 --> 02:15.507
Corporation, which includes the energy 
operations as well as the real estate operations.

02:16.330 --> 02:37.427
My involvement in the real estate aspects has been 
primarily from, say, the administration

02:16.330 --> 02:37.427
accounting finance standpoint, and I've been 
closely involved in financing the Woodlands

02:16.330 --> 02:37.427
operations since joining

02:16.330 --> 02:37.427
Mitchell. Tell me a little bit more about your 
background. Do you have degrees from Yes, I

02:40.900 --> 02:49.067
graduated with a BS degree from Mississippi State 
University in 1957. I have a CPA.

02:56.313 --> 03:00.737
Joined Arthur Anderson and Co. on graduation from 
Mississippi State. Worked one year, went in the

03:00.777 --> 03:07.222
U.S. Army Artillery for two years as a second 
lieutenant. Rejoined Arthur Anderson. in May of

03:11.444 --> 03:21.116
1960 and was with them here in the Houston office 
until I joined Mitchell in January of 1980. At the

03:21.296 --> 03:26.623
time I left Mitchell, I was a partner in the firm. 
You mean Anderson? I left Arthur Anderson & Co. I

03:29.346 --> 03:36.615
was a partner in the firm and had responsibility 
for the firm's oil and gas industry competence

03:29.346 --> 03:36.615
program. How did Mitchell find out about you? 
Where did you two link up? Previous to joining

03:41.532 --> 03:50.002
Mitchell, I had been the engagement partner on the 
Mitchell audit for a number of years and had

03:41.532 --> 03:50.002
rotated off of the audit. And in connection with 
the staff reorganization that they were

03:51.204 --> 04:04.840
undertaking in late 79 and early 80, I joined the 
company in, say, January of 1980. and in effect

04:05.461 --> 04:16.319
took over most of the responsibilities that Bill 
Tonary had previously held as Chief Financial

04:05.461 --> 04:16.319
Officer at that time. How, on a work-a-day basis, 
would you interact with the Woodlands

04:16.339 --> 04:24.973
Corporation?

04:25.514 --> 04:30.642
Generally speaking, well, as I said, in all of the 
areas that I have responsibility for,

04:31.432 --> 04:39.063
accounting, finance, probably the major ones, 
personnel, all of those different areas. A number

04:39.483 --> 04:46.613
of people that work for me in those areas are more, 
you know, are directly involved on a day-to-day

04:39.483 --> 04:46.613
basis. My primary involvement or greatest 
personal involvement would probably tend to be in

04:47.754 --> 04:59.751
the finance and accounting areas. What kind of 
expertise are you bringing to that that is

05:01.334 --> 05:06.231
required? Well, of course, any just the normal, 
you know, we have responsibility.

05:16.589 --> 05:32.204
My area, you know, has responsibility for all the 
reporting requirements, financial reporting

05:16.589 --> 05:32.204
requirements for Mitchell Energy and 
Development Corp., which is a public company, and

05:16.589 --> 05:32.204
so we keep all of the accounting records and 
prepare the financial statements and

05:16.589 --> 05:32.204
everything. And the data processing? All of the 
Mitchell entities, and that's,

05:33.526 --> 05:45.938
would all come under my supervision and 
responsibility, and the same thing with the

05:33.526 --> 05:45.938
financing. you know, the various different loans 
and financial structures that are required to

05:46.863 --> 06:02.318
finance the entire company's operations, 
including real estate, would come under my area of

05:46.863 --> 06:02.318
responsibility. During the, you know, the 80s, 
Houston went through a rather severe economic

06:02.338 --> 06:10.126
downturn. How did that affect your job and the 
Woodlands particularly? Because it did affect

06:17.845 --> 06:25.372
Yes, well of course initially when I joined 
Mitchell in January 1980, Houston was still

06:17.845 --> 06:25.372
booming.

06:27.254 --> 06:33.941
We had one or two very good years after that in terms 
of profitability and earnings. And then starting

06:35.182 --> 06:43.330
I think in either 81 or 82, you know, earnings began 
to decline because of the decline in oil prices or

06:44.069 --> 06:55.806
the erosion of the oil economy, which caused the 
banks to have problems, which caused the real

06:44.069 --> 06:55.806
estate industry in Houston to have problems. And 
probably the, in 1986 when the price of oil really

06:57.047 --> 07:10.887
went down I think as low as $10 a barrel, was when it 
really began to strongly impact not only the

07:11.913 --> 07:19.562
energy operations of Mitchell Energy and 
Development Corp, but also obviously the real

07:11.913 --> 07:19.562
estate operations. And the company went through a 
period of very low earnings, about $8 million a

07:20.703 --> 07:31.515
year for a couple of years there, fiscal 87 or 88, I 
believe. And since then, you know, we've started

07:32.596 --> 07:38.663
to come back in terms of earnings perspective. But 
during that time, particularly starting in, say,

07:39.503 --> 08:05.832
in 86, fiscal 86 or fiscal 87, you know, a company 
had to make a number of adjustments from an

07:39.503 --> 08:05.832
operating and financial standpoint in terms of

07:39.503 --> 08:05.832
cutting back on cost, overhead, employee head 
counts, and everything. in order to adapt to a

08:06.335 --> 08:14.489
different operating environment that existed 
during that period of time. I've been told that the

08:14.510 --> 08:17.134
woodlands is self-sufficient. Has that always 
been true? Self-sufficient? Financially, that

08:21.522 --> 08:25.689
it earns a profit.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.997
Generally speaking, they've been profitable. 
Because of the nature, though, of the company, the

08:31.360 --> 09:00.304
Woodlands Corporation's assets, which a 
substantial portion of which is undeveloped

08:31.360 --> 09:00.304
land,

08:31.360 --> 09:00.304
and the fact that they have a relatively high level 
of debt on the real estate side, a lot of the

08:31.360 --> 09:00.304
financial debt is guaranteed by the parent 
corporation, which is what enables the real

09:01.550 --> 09:12.847
estate operation to carry its financial, you 
know, or support its MND that it has. So, because

09:14.830 --> 09:25.886
the picture we've been getting is that

09:14.830 --> 09:25.886
the Woodlands is part of George Mitchell's 
vision. It doesn't seem

09:30.946 --> 09:37.275
necessarily be something he's doing because of 
the immediate return he's going to get. It's

09:38.397 --> 09:43.244
rather, well, some people have poppy farms. 
George Mitchell's building the woodlands.

09:50.255 --> 09:52.458
Has that been your impression as well? Well, of 
course, hopefully it'll ultimately turn out to be

09:52.478 --> 09:59.248
an economic

09:59.971 --> 10:00.652
success.

10:05.017 --> 10:28.763
Generally speaking, I would say George and most 
people perceive that the energy, speaking in

10:05.017 --> 10:28.763
terms of today's time, 1990, late 1990, you know, I 
think the energy portion of the company is looking

10:05.017 --> 10:28.763
for the near and mid-term is more likely to have a 
major impact on the company's overall

10:05.017 --> 10:28.763
operations, whereas you probably won't see any 
significant benefits from the real estate

10:29.857 --> 10:40.026
operations in terms of level of earnings and cash 
flows and things of that nature. It would be more a

10:40.166 --> 10:55.019
mid to long term time frame, which would

10:40.166 --> 10:55.019
say being anywhere from five to 15 years from 
today's time.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.003
The nature of a long master plan community like the 
Woodlands. You have a lot of front end costs and a

11:03.407 --> 11:18.601
lot of major investments to make and a lot of 
carrying costs in terms of interest charges,

11:03.407 --> 11:18.601
property taxes, things of that nature. And so as a 
result, generally speaking, real estate has been

11:18.841 --> 11:27.910
a net borrower of funds in the 1980s. Is that just 
the Woodlands, or are you including the thing at

11:28.598 --> 11:34.066
Snowmass and Pirate World? I tend to speak, when I 
speak the Woodlands Corporation, that would be,

11:34.086 --> 11:43.921
it's all in effect in one corporation, although 
they have a number of different subsidiaries. I'm

11:44.062 --> 11:55.178
basically referring to real estate in total, 
although the Woodlands itself probably

11:44.062 --> 11:55.178
comprises two-thirds or three-fourths of the 
real estate operations. So it's by far the... It's

11:58.079 --> 12:02.644
the most significant part of the overall real 
estate operation. But we haven't precisely

12:02.664 --> 12:12.616
separated out the operations of the woodlands 
itself in the head of real estate operations. I

12:12.636 --> 12:25.971
suppose it could be done, but we don't necessarily

12:12.636 --> 12:25.971
report our financial statements

12:12.636 --> 12:25.971
on that basis. As we've interviewed these other 
gentlemen, Every

12:27.745 --> 12:45.110
corporation has

12:27.745 --> 12:45.110
a culture to

12:27.745 --> 12:45.110
it, an environment that is unique to that 
corporation. It seems that an essential element,

12:45.130 --> 12:54.563
which wasn't surprising, but the strength of it is 
a little surprising. of Mitchell Edgerton

12:55.117 --> 13:07.793
Development Corporation, Woodlands 
Corporation, the personality of George

12:55.117 --> 13:07.793
Mitchell, his vision, his sense of what he wants to 
do.

13:09.796 --> 13:18.407
How have you perceived George Mitchell's 
influence in the development of the Woodlands? I

13:19.298 --> 13:37.187
mean, obviously he was the one who set the vision in 
motion, but he's also done many, many other things

13:19.298 --> 13:37.187
ancillary to the original vision, which

13:19.298 --> 13:37.187
to some many were a little bit surprising.

13:37.207 --> 13:45.340
Well, I think clearly, you know, George Mitchell 
has his very definite views on what the woodland

13:46.552 --> 13:52.061
should be, how it should be developed, and what the 
components of it would be. And while he does

13:52.221 --> 14:12.373
delegate a lot of the day-to-day operations, I 
mean, clearly he's got pretty much a hands-on

13:52.221 --> 14:12.373
approach in terms of the direction, overall 
management,

13:52.221 --> 14:12.373
major decisions that go into the

14:15.273 --> 14:30.252
The overall development of the woodlands,

14:15.273 --> 14:30.252
as to the type of development, the character of it,

14:15.273 --> 14:30.252
things of that nature. That's clearly the case. 
You know, things such as Hart, who's been in the

14:33.376 --> 14:44.470
Advanced Research Center, Cynthia Woods 
Mitchell-Povig, things of that nature. And so

14:45.496 --> 14:54.406
it's happening, yeah. And I was intrigued by the 
Venture Capital Group, which, so folklore goes,

14:54.426 --> 15:05.059
was started in a lobby, you know. You grabbed 
somebody and gave them $15 million and said, do it.

15:08.042 --> 15:12.027
And it spun off into something. Well, I don't know 
if it was quite that simple. Well, I've been told

15:15.889 --> 15:20.036
that story by a couple of people who maybe were 
repeating the same source. I don't know. Yeah.

15:21.278 --> 15:25.485
Well, I think it actually probably evolved a 
little bit more over time.

15:27.688 --> 15:33.738
You know, part of the concept was to try to bring 
startup companies to the world. And nurture tech.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.122
Yeah. High tech type of medical type areas. You 
know, the ultimate investment that would have

15:40.863 --> 15:48.857
been made in venture capital was really done over a 
long period of time. It certainly wasn't funded

15:48.997 --> 15:51.962
all up front initially. By a long shot,

15:51.982 --> 16:03.342
you know, they got a couple of people who were 
migrants who started out working in it initially.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.567
You know, we started out making, you know, and 
investment at a time in different various

16:06.935 --> 16:12.301
companies. Part of the criteria would be to focus 
on companies that we tend to locate in Whitlam. And

16:21.172 --> 16:29.061
ultimately, the Marty Center became the 
organization for Bruce Wither's Transmission

16:21.172 --> 16:29.061
Processing Division. So, you know, it certainly 
wasn't a matter of putting $15 million in up front

16:29.530 --> 16:35.137
by a long shot. Oh, no, I know that. It was a gradual 
development over the period of several years. But

16:44.068 --> 16:55.842
in comparison with Kingwood, for example, which, 
you know, people could raise an analogy, here's a

16:44.068 --> 16:55.842
corporate developed community, you know, and yet 
it's on the surface and substantially, it's

16:56.227 --> 17:03.875
totally different.

17:09.160 --> 17:22.774
Would there be a

17:09.160 --> 17:22.774
corporation, would the woodlands remain 
substantially the same if George Mitchell were,

17:09.160 --> 17:22.774
well, God forbid, if he should pass away. Well, 
eventually he will. He'll leave. He has to. We all

17:27.260 --> 17:27.741
do. But what will happen when that occurs? Oh, you 
know, it's obviously, on any development, it's a

17:32.348 --> 17:43.765
product of, you know, the person that's in charge 
of it and the direction they want it to go. You know,

17:43.985 --> 17:50.194
I would say at this point, you know, it would be hard 
to see. I think the fundamental you know,

17:53.551 --> 17:57.337
structure and organization is in place for the 
woodlands.

18:00.662 --> 18:07.752
Obviously a different individual might do, would 
do different things, you know, some things

18:00.662 --> 18:07.752
differently than what George would do. I think the 
basic concept of what's been developed to date

18:09.555 --> 18:20.031
would be hard to necessarily make any massive 
restructuring just simply because So many of the

18:20.602 --> 18:28.372
streets and roads and buildings and other 
infrastructure is already in place, like

18:20.602 --> 18:28.372
Woodlands. You know, the character of the 
buildings and companies that are already here

18:28.392 --> 18:42.369
can't change, you know, what the fundamental 
structure is.

18:45.773 --> 18:49.157
And so, you know, it would just really depend on the 
mentality. You know, Georgia's put a lot of

18:49.677 --> 19:06.638
infrastructure in, a lot of things, you know, some 
things have been done that other people might or

18:49.677 --> 19:06.638
might not conclude would be an essential part of 
the development, you know, so that would get to be a

18:49.677 --> 19:06.638
judgment call. Would you essentially feel that 
things would march on pretty much as they have in

19:08.940 --> 19:18.452
the past because of the already built-in history 
or Well, the infrastructure, Mr. President, is

19:18.820 --> 19:23.325
that a fair statement? Yeah, I would think that's 
generally true. Again, you can always dedicate,

19:25.427 --> 19:43.947
we've got about 4,000 net acres dedicated for 
commercial industrial space,

19:25.427 --> 19:43.947
you know, a lot of which has not been developed at 
this point. You know, only the future will tell,

19:43.967 --> 19:48.051
for instance, if there will be a market for that 
much space, you know, and so some of the character

19:48.453 --> 19:54.559
of that could change. Some of the character of the 
undeveloped land could change, but I think the

19:54.619 --> 20:08.754
general approach to the development, you know, 
should pretty much be locked in, I would think.

20:08.774 --> 20:08.874
Okay. What are the challenges the woodlands faces 
presently, from your perspective, from a

20:08.894 --> 20:17.683
financial and operating

20:08.894 --> 20:17.683
perspective? Well, obviously we've gone through 
in Houston since the early to mid 60s up to now. It's

20:30.664 --> 20:39.076
been pretty tough times economically because of 
the downturn in the oil business, which affected

20:30.664 --> 20:39.076
the real estate business also. So that's probably 
slowed the pace of development. fair amount what

20:45.102 --> 20:55.981
otherwise would have been at today, simply 
because Houston had that negative growth during

20:45.102 --> 20:55.981
some of those years there. You know, now we're 
being in the process, Houston is in the process of

20:58.325 --> 21:08.663
coming back from a business standpoint and a real 
estate standpoint, I think. particularly in the

21:09.655 --> 21:17.945
residential area, there's still a big surplus of 
office space, commercial space in Houston. And

21:18.846 --> 21:25.694
that's going to probably take a few more years to 
work through that system. And so the residential

21:28.016 --> 21:35.545
here is going very strongly now in terms

21:28.016 --> 21:35.545
of numbers of people and families moving to the 
place. And of course the overall concept really

21:36.267 --> 21:46.938
contemplates an integrated economic community 
of about 150,000 people ultimately. We're around

21:46.958 --> 21:48.700
30,000 now. And that wouldn't be in the downtown. 
We're somewhere, you know, at what we call the

21:51.482 --> 21:56.407
Metro Center. You know, so in fact you sort of have 
really a city of 150,000 people with all the

21:56.427 --> 22:05.076
facilities and everything. adjacent to it, with 
the concept that, you know, theoretically

22:05.495 --> 22:27.486
there'd be a job for every family that lives in the 
woodland, not that they'd all be matched up, but so

22:05.495 --> 22:27.486
that you'd have, so I think the big challenge would 
be to get, build up the commercial and other

22:05.495 --> 22:27.486
aspects of the operation that you'd float. 
somewhat lagging behind the rest of the

22:28.023 --> 22:39.859
woodlands, primarily because of economic, or in 
large part, probably because of the economic

22:28.023 --> 22:39.859
conditions. And there continues to be a national 
real estate flood, particularly in commercial

22:39.879 --> 22:49.693
space, so it's going to probably take some time to 
work through all that.

22:54.061 --> 23:02.731
Again, the carrying cost on an investment like 
this is very large, and pace is an important part of

22:54.061 --> 23:02.731
the development. The longer you carry it, the more 
the carrying costs are. So it's going to be

23:05.454 --> 23:11.580
important to pick up pace there on the commercial 
side at some point. Are you, or those who work with

23:11.601 --> 23:22.853
you or for you, what sort of staff reporting and 
analyses are going to be needed to identify, for

23:23.609 --> 23:32.721
example, the rate or the pace of growth. I know that 
goes on. Well, obviously, that's an integral part

23:34.903 --> 23:44.536
of the planning process that the overall company 
goes through, not just for real estate. But are

23:44.556 --> 23:50.443
there plans right now for dealing with the decade 
of the 90s, or with the next five years, What are you

23:50.677 --> 23:58.590
forecasting, I

23:50.677 --> 23:58.590
guess is what I'm asking, in terms of ? Oh, in terms 
of forecasting, I think generally speaking,

23:58.610 --> 24:17.140
they're probably looking at hopefully selling 
about 1,000

23:58.610 --> 24:17.140
houses a year on average

23:58.610 --> 24:17.140
in the foreseeable future.

24:23.532 --> 24:36.170
Hopefully the regional mall, as soon as the 
process

24:23.532 --> 24:36.170
has been worked on, hopefully that will get 
started here in the next year or two. So it would

24:36.190 --> 24:52.173
just be a continuation that we need to fill up the 
existing office space in the woodlands and

24:36.190 --> 24:52.173
hopefully look for

24:36.190 --> 24:52.173
other commercial development opportunities. 
The mall should be a good catalyst for development

24:52.193 --> 24:53.455
in the area.

24:56.506 --> 24:59.150
things in that picture. How does Mr. Mitchell 
utilize public relations to his advantage?

25:03.658 --> 25:10.228
What's his operating philosophy in terms of the 
utilization

25:03.658 --> 25:10.228
of public relations? Well, I was, you know, that's 
probably something he has spent a lot of time and,

25:10.248 --> 25:22.328
you know, is willing to devote some personal time 
to to the public relations area, and I think

25:23.388 --> 25:41.947
probably uses it to his advantage and the 
company's

25:23.388 --> 25:41.947
advantage, you

25:23.388 --> 25:41.947
know, very well. He's probably one of your more 
outspoken type of chief executive officers for a

25:41.967 --> 25:48.774
major company. We probably have a more 
sophisticated operation in that respect than

25:48.794 --> 25:51.236
maybe other companies our size would tend to have. 
And that's because of Mr. Mitchell? Yeah, I would

25:52.497 --> 26:06.956
say primarily that's reflective of his wishes and 
desires, and I guess feeling that there's

25:52.497 --> 26:06.956
benefits to be gained

25:52.497 --> 26:06.956
from that time. And I tend to agree

26:06.976 --> 26:11.822
that that's probably true. So he does a good job

26:11.842 --> 26:20.534
of utilizing the media, I think. He's generally 
known as an accessible type of person for the

26:20.554 --> 26:22.116
media. So as a result, the public tends to get 
called on to comment

26:22.940 --> 26:36.098
and be a part of things that the otherwise 
wouldn't. Generally speaking, most of the

26:36.118 --> 26:48.395
publicity that's generated tends to be in favor

26:36.118 --> 26:48.395
of the nation. So any time you've got a particular 
real estate product or something to sell, In all

26:52.471 --> 27:10.610
corporations, there's line responsibilities, 
and then there's the individuals fulfilling

26:52.471 --> 27:10.610
those line responsibilities frequently can be 
interchanged, or others can do that. But then

27:11.631 --> 27:17.517
individuals also have unique, or not unique, but 
maybe special, skills or abilities or capacities

27:17.952 --> 27:23.399
that they bring to a task. I'm going to ask you to be 
modest. What is it you bring? What is George

27:29.267 --> 27:33.693
Mitchell, why does he want you around? What's your 
real contribution to the corporation? Well,

27:37.759 --> 27:46.170
obviously it's in the areas that I have, you know, 
primary responsibilities for.

27:47.281 --> 27:50.806
Obviously I have an accounting degree, CPA. I'd 
say my primary strengths are in the financial

27:52.609 --> 28:01.401
accounting financing area.

28:01.421 --> 28:08.952
Aside from the overall administrative 
responsibilities, that's probably the major

28:10.838 --> 28:16.103
major contribution that I make to the overall 
organization. To be sure the company is well

28:16.123 --> 28:26.592
financed and the financial reporting is properly 
handled. Since George is not inclined to sell a lot

28:26.612 --> 28:39.343
of equity in the company per se, most of our 
financing for the company's operations has to be

28:40.083 --> 28:53.458
either internal cash flow, profits, or third 
party debt, or in some cases

28:40.083 --> 28:53.458
joint venture arrangements. So that's obviously 
a company, a $2 billion company,

28:53.478 --> 29:03.408
and there are a lot of requirements in that area. I 
don't want to take all your afternoon. Are there

29:05.511 --> 29:07.693
questions I should have asked you that I didn't?

29:10.677 --> 29:17.046
Oh, gosh, I'm sure there's a lot of things you could 
get into. The,

29:17.067 --> 29:31.748
you know, I think, well, you know, Mitchell 
Energy, I guess, and Development Corp is, in a

29:17.067 --> 29:31.748
sense, two different businesses, you know, 
energy and real estate. Obviously, when you have a

29:33.171 --> 29:36.195
62% shareholder, the chief executive president, 
chief executive officer, whatever else he wants

29:37.289 --> 29:52.825
to be in the company, you know, that's still to a 
large extent run as one company in the sense of

29:37.289 --> 29:52.825
overall direction. So

29:52.845 --> 30:04.157
while the operations are distinct in and of 
themselves, you know, I still don't, you know,

30:05.099 --> 30:12.146
financial standpoint and everything and sort of 
view it as an overall operation. As I say, part of

30:12.166 --> 30:31.984
the thing that makes the real estate work, 
particularly during this development phase, is

30:12.166 --> 30:31.984
the strength of the energy operation in terms of 
the cash flows and the values and things of that

30:12.166 --> 30:31.984
nature. debt on the real estate side tends to 
increase, you know, as projects and other things

30:32.403 --> 30:42.133
are developed.

30:42.153 --> 30:48.199
You don't necessarily have the liquidity in a real 
estate operation that you have in an oil, gas, or

30:42.153 --> 30:48.199
energy operation. And so it's important to, an 
important part of George being able to do what he's

30:48.699 --> 31:00.891
done on the real estate side and probably the 
presence of the energy operations there. and

31:01.782 --> 31:21.988
apparent guarantees on the real estate debt, that 
while the values are there on the real estate side

31:01.782 --> 31:21.988
to support the debt, the liquidity, particularly 
when you have these downturns in the real estate

31:01.782 --> 31:21.988
economies, the real estate is not a liquid asset, 
even in good times. In difficult times, it's

31:22.008 --> 31:28.937
impossible to move almost, unless it's up in a fire 
sale price. The liquidity that the energy

31:29.828 --> 31:41.358
provides, or the fact that it's there to provide 
liquidity if it's needed, is an important part of

31:29.828 --> 31:41.358
how the real estate can be managed. Yeah, that's 
come through. Do you view the two corporations as

31:44.841 --> 31:52.068
essentially the same, as you were mentioning? 
Well, it's the same in the sense that, as I say,

31:52.088 --> 31:56.872
they... I mean, they do more than hold hands. 
They... I mean, the operating, I guess, my areas

31:59.782 --> 32:07.572
tend to be more of a common link between the two. I 
mean, the people that operate the individual

32:07.752 --> 32:12.278
businesses are different. Sure. In real estate, 
transmission processing, production, things of

32:13.419 --> 32:19.487
that nature. But in terms of the fact that, you 
know, the overall resources of the company are

32:28.705 --> 32:53.211
utilized to achieve the overall operating 
results, you know, of the company, you know, to

32:28.705 --> 32:53.211
that extent that I was saying common, there's 
common ground there

32:28.705 --> 32:53.211
that makes part of it, you know, for instance, part 
of our major financing for the company has been too

32:54.035 --> 32:57.661
public. Mitchell Energy and Development Corp, 
the parent, has had two public debt issues at the

32:57.681 --> 33:07.096
parent company level, which basically has no 
operations. It's just a holding company that owns

33:07.116 --> 33:13.265
the stock from the energy cell and the real estate 
cell. So, a lot of your probably better than half of

33:17.761 --> 33:32.617
our debt financing in the public debt markets and 
downstream to the two operations

33:17.761 --> 33:32.617
as needed to fund their operations.

33:33.698 --> 33:37.442
Are you the architect of some of these debt 
management? Well, it's my area,

33:37.462 --> 33:43.268
obviously, the financing is my responsibility. 
So, to that extent, you know, it's all We're

33:48.271 --> 33:53.819
financing as any Mitchell Energy and Development 
Corp, but not as an individual subsidiary. Now, we

33:53.839 --> 34:03.914
do some

33:53.839 --> 34:03.914
of the financing, but

33:53.839 --> 34:03.914
it's a subsidiary level. But a good part of it has 
been, you know, better than half of it probably

34:03.934 --> 34:10.504
has been at the Grand Country level, too. Is there a 
flow both directions of

34:18.680 --> 34:23.067
Well, that's maybe not what I wanted to ask. The 
decision-making process, there's various cells

34:23.087 --> 34:34.965
or staff groups that do planning and development 
and what have you. How are those decisions made?

34:37.849 --> 34:43.438
The decisions of

34:37.849 --> 34:43.438
what you were just talking about, about how You 
mentioned half is done at the parent company level

34:43.823 --> 34:49.150
and half is done elsewhere. Who decides? Well, it 
depends on what you're talking of in terms of

34:51.674 --> 34:58.083
financing aspects. Most of that's part of my 
decision area. In terms of the overall budget,

35:02.349 --> 35:10.320
each operating group prepares their capital 
budgets and their operating plans. And we pull

35:10.705 --> 35:16.031
them all together on a company-wide basis. And 
then to the extent you set priorities or there are

35:16.051 --> 35:26.482
limitations on resources, which there usually 
are, then George has to make the final decision. So

35:26.502 --> 35:28.544
he sets the priorities in terms of? Oh, yeah. Yeah, 
clearly. Yeah, clearly. OK. That's what I

35:30.787 --> 35:33.990
figured. What else? Oh, nothing just jumps out at 
me. They say you could, on individual components,

35:40.456 --> 35:50.570
I'm sure we could talk on a lot of things, not 
knowing what level of detail you want to get into.

35:50.590 --> 35:52.513
Well, part of the problem is I don't know that 
either. Yeah. Which is a bit of a challenge.
