00:13.092 --> 00:16.896
So what is the status since five years ago with your 
father?

00:21.381 --> 00:33.294
Five years, my dad was in concentration camp, 
which was out in the open country and all that, and

00:21.381 --> 00:33.294
lived in a shed. And he had his best friend with him. 
So that was one of the good things. At least they had

00:39.241 --> 00:40.647
some friends. And he would tell us that they would 
make him go farm, plant stuff, plant food, chop

00:47.129 --> 00:58.412
down trees, you know, very hard thing, carry wood. 
Basically, it was just for his own good because he

00:58.712 --> 01:03.923
had to do everything for himself. They did not 
provide anything. So in other words, he had to

01:08.510 --> 01:15.159
plant food for him to eat, and also for them to take 
some, too. So, in other words, you had to do it for

01:15.279 --> 01:18.904
them and for you. Plant your own shed, and if it gets 
rotten down by the rain, because they lived five

01:20.146 --> 01:36.087
years, it's so long, they had to renew it every 
time, because they stay there for a long period of

01:20.146 --> 01:36.087
time, so they had to rebuild it and all that. And my 
grandparents, one time my dad actually knew where

01:36.235 --> 01:46.347
he was at. So my grandparents would go down and 
would meet him. And the thing was that when they

01:52.074 --> 02:03.728
came down, the land had barbed wires around the 
place that they were being held. And there would be

02:04.231 --> 02:13.705
a guard escorting you to go in, but not inside past 
the barbed wire. You would stay out there, and

02:14.005 --> 02:19.033
anybody who wanted to talk to you would come out. 
And it's just kind of like a prison where you have a

02:19.734 --> 02:24.501
little wall between you, and you have to talk 
between them. And it was just like that. And my

02:25.956 --> 02:32.885
grandparents, they were really glad that they see 
him and all that. And they did not want you to have a

02:32.905 --> 02:39.714
really long meeting, long talk. So they wanted to 
make it brief. And then if you would have it long,

02:41.336 --> 02:44.961
they would make you leave and all that. And so my 
grandparents did that at least two times the most

02:45.282 --> 02:52.311
because they were getting old. they could not take 
the long travels and all that. So they

02:55.772 --> 03:01.742
met him twice. And later on, at the beginning, 
after that, we thought that the communists, they

03:01.902 --> 03:12.819
were getting a little bit easy. They're getting 
easy so that they let their families see each

03:12.879 --> 03:16.565
other. But then later on, We found out that the 
reason why they wanted us to see him was that he was

03:18.329 --> 03:26.202
going to be moved to somewhere else. And then we 
would not know where he is at again. So in other

03:30.329 --> 03:34.756
words, we would be back to square one not knowing 
where he is. And so a couple months later on, After

03:38.883 --> 03:51.684
my grandparents met him for the last time, and then 
he stopped sending letters for the last two months

03:38.883 --> 03:51.684
and all that. So my mom wrote a letter back to my 
grandparents and asked them, what's taking so

03:51.704 --> 03:57.694
long? What happened and all that? And so she said, 
there's something wrong. There's something

04:00.859 --> 04:01.440
wrong. They must be doing something to him. She has 
not received letters from him at all and all that.

04:06.668 --> 04:08.130
So we were getting really worried. We said, uh-oh, 
looks like they're getting into the tough stuff

04:08.531 --> 04:12.617
and all that. Well, during that time, we didn't 
know anything. But then later on, we received his

04:17.584 --> 04:20.428
letter. And he said he don't know where he is. And he 
told us that his best friend died because he

04:23.372 --> 04:29.862
couldn't handle it anymore. He was getting real 
skinny. Basically, my dad thought, think that he

04:33.507 --> 04:48.380
died, his best friend died because of 
malnutrition because all they ate was, all they,

04:33.507 --> 04:48.380
all the communists gave them was just rice and they 
were not white rice. They were, back in the, back in

04:48.840 --> 04:53.424
Vietnam you would have two kinds of rice. There 
would be white rice for the people to eat and the

04:53.865 --> 05:02.552
other rice is red for the for the pigs to eat, which 
is kind of like barley or oats or something like

05:02.836 --> 05:08.623
that. And so they would feed you red rice. That's 
what we called it. They would feed you red rice, and

05:15.231 --> 05:17.193
that was it. You had your own food and all that. So 
basically, they ate rice plain or rice with salt

05:19.616 --> 05:26.464
every day. If you would not eat, you would starve. 
My dad said that's probably one reason why his best

05:31.275 --> 05:35.123
friend died. Another thing was too much pressure. 
He was going crazy because he was missing his

05:37.549 --> 05:44.284
families and all that. So we were real sad and all 
that. And then my mom asked if he was all right

05:46.636 --> 05:57.690
because my dad had a problem with his health. 
Whenever he would go to the bathroom, whenever he

05:58.391 --> 06:10.247
would go to the bathroom, he would be bleeding. He 
would be bleeding. That was my mom's real concern.

06:17.943 --> 06:22.877
My mom's real concern was that because they did not 
provide toilet paper for him so that he would have

06:23.853 --> 06:29.378
to use leaves to wipe, you know, to clean. So if he 
did that, he would have disease and, you know, it

06:29.718 --> 06:39.387
would be infected and they would not provide 
doctors for them for him to be nursed and all that.

06:39.827 --> 06:53.860
So, you know, that, because right after when my mom 
said that his best friend died, my mom started to

06:39.827 --> 06:53.860
get worried because, you know, she said, and then 
she was also thinking that maybe they're going to

06:39.827 --> 06:53.860
keep them as long as, until they die. But then, 
after that, we found out that one of my dad's uncle,

06:53.840 --> 07:13.519
who was in the army, and he was not an officer, but he 
was kind of like a well-known soldier before,

06:53.840 --> 07:13.519
because... at the beginning of the war, he went to 
fight. And he had a very good record of killing a lot

07:18.722 --> 07:23.348
of communists. So when he was being taken, they 
tortured him. They pulled out all of his teeth,

07:28.915 --> 07:37.807
trying to ask him questions like, how did you kill 
the communists? How many did you kill? And all

07:39.169 --> 07:39.810
that. And so he would not answer. And they would 
torture him. They would beat him up, break his

07:44.866 --> 07:48.690
legs, break his arm. And he would be all bruised. 
His face would be all bruised and all that, broken

07:50.512 --> 07:55.116
ribs and all that. But then we found out that he was 
being released. So he went home. And the thing

08:00.321 --> 08:08.068
about the communists was that when they release 
somebody, they don't let you know. They do not.

08:09.997 --> 08:13.683
inform the family so that the family could come and 
pick him up. They did not let you know. So my uncle

08:15.345 --> 08:17.408
went home. He told us, he said that one day they just 
say, OK, you're free to go. And they just opened the

08:26.021 --> 08:28.044
gate. And he was left all out by himself. And so he 
had nowhere to go because it was right out in the

08:31.650 --> 08:38.620
open country. He started to go walking down the 
street, and then he stopped by a place where a

08:38.954 --> 08:50.032
stranger, where this farm family lived. And he did 
not know them, but he asked them if they could help

08:50.492 --> 08:57.924
him to contact his family and all that. And then 
later on, he went home, and his wife was just

08:58.265 --> 09:06.818
shocked that he was standing right in front of her 
because he... She did not get any contact that he

09:07.051 --> 09:28.047
was being released, but she was real happy that he 
was there and in and she was happy and she was sad

09:07.051 --> 09:28.047
because He looked like he was gonna die because he 
was in such a bad shape But later on they nursed him

09:07.051 --> 09:28.047
and all that and he was all right and so Basically, 
everybody from my mom's side and my dad's side

09:28.398 --> 09:35.465
were, was being released, except for my dad. He was 
the only one left in there, and, uh, Was he tortured

09:38.894 --> 09:40.136
in any way? He said that he did not get tortured. He 
said that they... Well, I don't know if he did or not

09:43.400 --> 09:51.631
because if he would have said it, they would have 
erased it. But we would assume that he wasn't

09:52.492 --> 09:57.579
because, by the way, of his handwriting. My mom... 
and my grandmother, they would take an assumption

09:59.482 --> 10:05.890
that his handwriting looks normal as usual. So his 
health must be real fine, because he said he's

10:06.211 --> 10:10.937
doing all right and all that. And so after two 
months, they received his letter. And then he told

10:16.464 --> 10:23.673
them, he said that he's been moved to another place 
out in the country. And he would not know where he's

10:24.314 --> 10:26.637
at again. And that was the last letter. And then two 
more years passed. And then my mom started getting

10:34.593 --> 10:40.419
to worry because my mom started to say, oh, no, this 
is it. There's no way they're going to let him out at

10:41.100 --> 10:44.344
all now. And for the whole next year, for the whole 
year, for one whole year at one time, we would not

10:44.364 --> 10:57.518
receive any letters, anything from him. The next 
day, you know, and then one day, he would, we would

10:58.510 --> 11:06.867
receive his letter, and he would say that, He was 
moved to another place again. And so my

11:11.206 --> 11:19.554
grandparents wanted to come and visit him, but my 
mom told them not to because for one reason was

11:11.206 --> 11:19.554
their health. They had to be healthy in order for 
them to keep the contact going. That's one reason.

11:26.001 --> 11:33.808
And the other reason was it was useless for you to go 
because you would not know where he's at because

11:26.001 --> 11:33.808
they kept on moving him. So why should you go see him 
for him? And so, and then after seven years, seven

11:37.019 --> 11:48.415
and a half years, my dad wrote another letter 
saying that they're going to let him go. And so at

11:49.216 --> 11:52.621
that time, my mom was real happy, was really happy. 
We were all happy. The neighborhood was happy

11:54.183 --> 12:01.693
because they actually, you know, they kind of like 
knew the news because Everybody was being

12:01.673 --> 12:05.981
released around the neighborhood except for him. 
So, you know, the people would come and ask, you

12:06.041 --> 12:10.749
know, has he been released yet and all that? How 
long is he going to be released? And so one day he was

12:12.712 --> 12:15.096
released. And I guess he was so important that they 
did not let him go by himself. They actually drove

12:21.908 --> 12:24.593
him home. They drove him home. He had the same 
luggages that my mom had packed for him. And he

12:32.158 --> 12:34.120
stayed in the house. And later on, the first couple 
of days, we thought that he was already free and all

12:34.360 --> 12:42.849
that. But then later on, a couple of days later, my 
grandmother, when she'd go shopping, go grocery

12:42.869 --> 12:50.817
and all that, she would find out that there would be 
at least two or three guys hanging around the

12:51.202 --> 13:02.052
house, the front yard of the house, the backyard of 
the house, the front door, the back door, and all

12:51.202 --> 13:02.052
that. They were practically around the house so 
that they would keep an eye on him, where he would go

13:02.313 --> 13:09.179
and all that. And so after that, my grandmother 
would go back inside and told him not to go

13:09.600 --> 13:17.988
anywhere, told him to stay inside because they're 
out there. They're out there just looking after

13:18.328 --> 13:20.550
him. And he stayed home for one month. And they took 
him again. And it was just the same old procedure.

13:31.181 --> 13:32.243
One day, they would come. They would make up an 
excuse. They would say, OK, we need to ask you some

13:36.690 --> 13:40.596
questions. So we need to take you to a certain 
place. And at that time, you know, My grandmother

13:47.041 --> 13:56.596
knew that we should not trust them at all now 
because the last time they did it to all the other

13:47.041 --> 13:56.596
people, all the other people were shocked. They 
said that it was a meeting, but it wasn't. It was

14:00.122 --> 14:03.567
actually taking everybody to the concentration 
camp. So now my grandmother knew that they're

14:04.068 --> 14:07.834
taking him again. So he was just right back in the 
concentration camp again. Right, but this time

14:11.087 --> 14:15.153
they did not tell him where he's at and all that. And 
so he was taken out again and no letters for a couple

14:15.713 --> 14:21.782
of months again. And then another day, receive a 
letter saying that he's fine and he's at another

14:22.263 --> 14:30.715
place and all that. And then he would stay for 
another... for another two years. So that would

14:37.725 --> 14:39.807
make it nine and a half years. He would stay for 
another two years. And then they released him

14:42.349 --> 14:44.332
again. In what year was this? This was, he was taken 
in 76. So in around, in the 85,

14:51.679 --> 15:02.290
September of 85 or something like that. He was 
being released, and my grandmother and him talked

15:03.299 --> 15:08.166
and all that. Then later on, he told them, my 
grandmother wrote a letter to my mom and all that.

15:14.094 --> 15:22.406
And then we found out that that last two years, he 
was right inside Saigon. They kept him right in the

15:23.928 --> 15:26.311
cities. So in other words, he did, that whole two 
years, we did not receive a single letter because

15:32.965 --> 15:39.418
they were so close in, so they did not want him to 
write letters. So

15:40.079 --> 15:46.051
he was not out in the countryside anymore. So that 
two years, he was in a penitentiary that was in

15:46.392 --> 15:52.003
Saigon. And then my mom thought, oh, no, they're 
going to take him out away again for a couple more

15:52.591 --> 15:57.857
months. But then later on, we found out the first 
couple of weeks when he was home, they looked over

15:58.438 --> 16:04.224
him. But then later on, they started to back off. 
And then my grandmother said, think that it was OK.

16:12.794 --> 16:20.843
So he started to go out, taking contact, start the 
escape as fast as possible. But

16:21.802 --> 16:38.427
the problem was that we were running out of time 
because when my dad was still in concentration

16:21.802 --> 16:38.427
camp, my mom wrote a letter. During that two years, 
my mom wrote a letter to my grandmother saying

16:38.761 --> 16:46.108
that, OK, it's getting hopeless now. So if you two 
want to go over here with us, why don't you go ahead

16:46.509 --> 16:54.076
and make paper? Because at that time, the 
government of the communists, the communist

16:54.377 --> 17:07.570
government, agreed to release all of the 
handicapped people, all the old people, and all of

17:07.988 --> 17:17.138
the Asian-American

17:07.988 --> 17:17.138
kids to go free as they choose. And so at that time, 
my grandfather quickly made paper for them to

17:17.158 --> 17:23.325
leave. For your grandparents to leave. Right, for 
my grandparents to leave. So in other words, my

17:25.948 --> 17:32.255
dad, if he would get released, he would be by 
himself. So your grandparents are over here now?

17:34.853 --> 17:35.193
Right. My grandparents just got over here last 
December, which was 85, December of 85. And so the

17:40.761 --> 17:46.828
paper was being done and there were two ways for 
them to come over. One was go straight to United

17:47.049 --> 17:51.114
States or the other go to Canada. Canada is partly 
French. And so my grandfather was really

17:55.694 --> 17:59.549
connected with the French. So he wanted to go real 
fast, really fast. He didn't want any delay. And

18:07.135 --> 18:13.463
another thing was Canada was more lenient than the 
United States at that time because it was so late.

18:13.743 --> 18:20.172
They were getting very hard for you to come in. And 
so we told them to go to Canada and then from Canada

18:20.592 --> 18:28.703
make the paper to go to the United States. And so 
that's what they did. And it did not take them that

18:31.066 --> 18:33.309
long at all. So your father was by yourself? Yes. 
When my father was released, they were still with

18:37.387 --> 18:45.559
him, but they told him what they did, and he said it 
was fine, you know. And then later on, we found out

18:46.140 --> 18:52.610
that it was fine because he was being released for 
real now, you know. And so he was out making

18:53.131 --> 19:03.867
contact, out meeting all the relatives and the 
neighbors and all that, and making contact. And

19:03.887 --> 19:05.509
then later on, My mom wrote another letter saying 
that and you know they wrote letter back and forth

19:05.742 --> 19:17.153
and back and forth and then later on they came to an 
agreement to let's drop the plan for him to escape

19:18.247 --> 19:23.178
by boat because it was getting too late. It was 
1985. And by that time, it would be too dangerous.

19:28.369 --> 19:30.874
And if he would get caught, they would probably 
kill him right there. And so they dropped the plan.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.268
And they said, now the government has this new plan 
for you to go by paper where you would get on an

19:37.248 --> 19:41.217
airplane and you would fly. And so we agreed that 
that would be the plan. But then the only setback

19:45.025 --> 19:52.201
that we had was if you go by boat, it would be faster 
for you to come over. If you go by the paper, it would

19:52.562 --> 19:56.691
take so many process from the government of the 
United States and the government of the North

19:56.671 --> 20:08.042
Vietnamese that it would take so long that we would 
not know how long he would be in order for him to come

19:56.671 --> 20:08.042
over. And so, but we were all willing to sacrifice 
the long period of time instead. For safety. Yes,

20:16.050 --> 20:16.871
for safety. So on December, my grandparents had 
their name on the list and they left. And at that

20:25.450 --> 20:29.775
time, my dad was in good health, in good condition 
already. So he was basically, he was, could be on

20:30.116 --> 20:34.761
his, he could be on his own already. So my mom was 
really happy, you know, and all that because we

20:35.161 --> 20:43.851
were really happy when they, when he, when he came 
back, that was the only thing. And so, Have y'all

20:45.642 --> 20:48.806
filed the paperwork for your father? Yes. Right 
after my mom found out the news that we could do it by

20:49.668 --> 20:57.499
the paperwork, she did it right away. In fact, she 
did it for my grandparents also. She did it for my

21:02.305 --> 21:06.431
grandparents, and then she mailed it to my aunt 
from Canada. She thought that... It would take my

21:09.267 --> 21:18.057
dad that just that short of a time to go because it 
took my grandparents only four months. No,

21:19.018 --> 21:20.580
actually it took them. Yeah, it took them four 
months and they were, they were already out. But,

21:26.547 --> 21:33.135
uh, right after my dad came back, she started on it 
right away and now it's still going on. And, uh, uh,

21:33.275 --> 21:37.840
you know, once a month we would contact the 
attorney. that did the paperwork for us, saying

21:38.393 --> 21:41.618
how long more and all that. And they would make some 
excuses. They would say that there's probably

21:44.202 --> 21:52.916
something wrong with it, or they're holding back 
the processes or something like that. Or they

21:53.377 --> 21:58.665
would blame it on the North Vietnamese that 
they're holding back on the processes. They're

21:58.925 --> 22:00.969
trying to slow it down and all that. So the paper is 
still in order right now. I don't know how long it's

22:04.955 --> 22:12.918
gonna be until my dad comes over, but at least the 
papers are in. My mom said that But we, our paper is

22:16.987 --> 22:32.594
much faster than other people because we had, when 
we came over here, we had a couple of friends that

22:16.987 --> 22:32.594
also had, you know, my friend, my mom, yeah, my 
mom's friend, you know, her husband was also in

22:16.987 --> 22:32.594
concentration camp. And so she did that paper and 
all that, and she said that it took, that she is

22:36.882 --> 22:41.667
still on the waiting, you know, she is not even on 
the waiting list. And we were on the waiting list,

22:41.787 --> 22:45.672
but the waiting list is really long. It's a very 
long list. And especially my dad is a special, a

22:47.494 --> 23:06.535
special case so that they would have to take a 
really deep, you know, good deal of look and

22:47.494 --> 23:06.535
decision on whether if he is, if they're gonna let 
him go or not. Yeah.
