WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:02.571
battalion there. Actually one time we had a 
battalion at the Ordnance Depot at Texarkana,

00:02.632 --> 00:18.834
Arkansas and one at Fort Polk, Louisiana and our 
brigade headquarters was at Fort Chaffee. So I

00:18.915 --> 00:28.468
would use our helicopters or air transportation 
to visit both places, spend a day or two each week

00:29.427 --> 00:31.469
with the other battalions. We would visit and then 
the other battalions would be report to active

00:33.891 --> 00:41.818
duty some other time at some other place. Might 
have been at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, Camp Perry,

00:43.139 --> 00:50.365
Ohio, various places. We went wherever the Army 
sent us.

00:55.950 --> 00:58.472
And nearly every year We would have somebody in the 
Washington area. So you went where the Army needed

01:05.102 --> 01:07.145
the skills? Sure.

01:11.411 --> 01:22.148
We might have something to do with choosing our 
post camper station because we would try to

01:11.411 --> 01:22.148
determine once Fifth Army headquarters would 
notify us of what the possibilities were. We would

01:26.857 --> 01:47.141
check to see what the suitability of the 
facilities and the projects available were so

01:26.857 --> 01:47.141
that we could confer then with the commanding 
general of the Army Readiness Region or Fifth Army

01:26.857 --> 01:47.141
about the suitability of this. If there were more 
than one possibility, well, we would have a chance

01:47.262 --> 01:51.747
to exercise some

01:54.460 --> 01:59.891
selectivity based upon the training that would be 
available. And also based upon what we considered

02:00.392 --> 02:04.960
to be the interest of the troops in going there. 
Because of course we were always interested in

02:05.722 --> 02:11.473
having them reenlist in the reserves. trying to 
use this as a recruiting advantage when

02:13.225 --> 02:18.072
recruiting got tough. What kind of things would 
you look forward or look for in the interest of the

02:18.572 --> 02:26.363
troops? Well we would look for what sort of support 
facilities would be available on the post. Post

02:33.673 --> 02:37.739
exchange facilities, service clubs. 
Cafeterias. Theaters. things for off-duty

02:41.018 --> 02:43.742
entertainment of the troops. And even more 
important than that, we looked for what was

02:46.366 --> 02:55.941
available to support the training projects. That 
is, did the post engineer have all the materials we

02:56.381 --> 03:04.113
needed for the various kind of construction 
projects? Were we able to do dirt work? vertical

03:10.448 --> 03:17.197
construction, exercise, all of the skills, 
carpenters, electricians, plumbers,

03:10.448 --> 03:17.197
everything. So these men could use the skills that 
they had. Absolutely. Oh yeah. And so they'd do

03:21.182 --> 03:23.445
things that weren't just make work. Absolutely. 
And you know I commanded an artillery battalion

03:25.027 --> 03:34.380
and of course when we got through and left was there 
wasn't anything left behind. Right. We were, we

03:35.341 --> 03:39.747
had a destruction mission so I liked the engineer 
Yeah. Activities, because when we left, you could

03:40.650 --> 03:51.101
see what was done there could be attributed 
forever to the unit that did the construction. So

03:51.201 --> 03:53.183
they took quite a lot of pride in that. Yeah. I would 
think so. Let's talk about the growth. During the

03:57.888 --> 04:06.116
1970s, of course, this is another period in which 
there is a draft, a very active draft. And of

04:06.136 --> 04:09.700
course, the war in Vietnam. Did your command, did 
the numbers of your command grow, or did the

04:09.967 --> 04:16.057
waiting lines increase? Well, the all-volunteer 
Army time, let's see, I don't remember a draft

04:18.080 --> 04:26.713
period in the 70s. We've registered for the draft 
right now, but I don't remember. Drafted until

04:29.598 --> 04:31.080
about 62. Yeah, but you said 70s. Yeah, I mean 72. 
Drafted until about 72, I mean. And then we get the

04:37.087 --> 04:38.610
all-volunteer. About 73 we get the 
all-volunteer. Well, during the draft period,

04:41.395 --> 04:48.748
we were in much better position.

04:51.648 --> 05:00.617
And we weren't near as good then as we were in the 50s 
because the likelihood of actually being

04:51.648 --> 05:00.617
conscripted was much lower during that period 
than it was during the 50s. So people were much more

05:01.898 --> 05:10.927
willing to take a chance, one in a thousand or 
something that they might be drafted. And of

05:11.327 --> 05:18.955
course with the old volunteer army and denial of 
our being able to use the ROTC cadet. We were

05:22.247 --> 05:23.789
restricted on that. Oh, when did that come about? I 
don't remember exactly.

05:30.958 --> 05:38.508
But it was based on a principle that a cadet 
couldn't draw off two checks from the federal

05:30.958 --> 05:38.508
government or something like that. Anyhow, we got 
to the point where we couldn't use the ROTC cadets

05:38.528 --> 05:43.155
anymore. Must have been about the mid-1970s. I 
don't know when it was. I think it was earlier than

05:46.940 --> 05:48.722
that. That dried up a major source of outstanding 
young people. And during the old Volunteer Army,

05:53.237 --> 06:06.912
we've had to devote an untold amount of time to 
recruiting, and it was just sort of a declining

05:53.237 --> 06:06.912
proposition all the time. And of course, until 
today, apparently all of the units are

06:08.894 --> 06:18.945
substantially understrength, including the 
active Army units. Actually, shortly after I

06:19.313 --> 06:30.551
left, the very last duty I performed is go to advise 
the chief staff of the United States Army about

06:19.313 --> 06:30.551
recruiting in Army reserves. They had an 
intention to take away the recruiting

06:32.574 --> 06:44.173
responsibility from the reserves themselves 
with the support people we had of civilian type,

06:32.574 --> 06:44.173
civil service people. and turn over the 
recruiting responsibility to the recruiting

06:44.980 --> 06:49.266
command. And I tried as hard as I could to persuade 
them not to do that, but they did it anyway. Okay,

06:57.536 --> 07:00.800
why did you want, what was at issue here? Why did you 
want them not to do that? Well, we were the best in

07:02.863 --> 07:08.771
the 5th Army at recruiting in our particular 
brigade. We had dedicated people, civil service

07:09.291 --> 07:12.996
type. And I just didn't figure that anybody else 
would have as strong an interest in our success as

07:14.242 --> 07:20.510
we did ourselves. And of course it was a point of 
pride to us that we were the most successful

07:20.550 --> 07:29.422
recruiting unit, major unit in the whole Fifth 
Army. Which went all the way up to Michigan. The

07:33.487 --> 07:37.612
Fifth Army was just one of three Continental 
armies, so there were a lot of units in it. We, of any

07:39.815 --> 07:44.181
major command, we had the best recruiting 
success. We worked at it real hard.

07:52.981 --> 08:01.013
And so you didn't want the

07:52.981 --> 08:01.013
federal, or you didn't want the Washington people 
to take over? Well, they weren't based in

08:02.195 --> 08:11.248
Washington, but the recruiting command was based 
in Illinois.

08:11.718 --> 08:15.583
We were given fairly substantial resources to do 
this job. A

08:17.425 --> 08:32.345
group of dual service people that were full time 
employees on a civil service basis, but they also

08:17.425 --> 08:32.345
functioned in the Army Reserves in most cases, you 
see. And we had recruited some fine people into

08:34.007 --> 08:36.330
that. These people were well led, fairly well 
supported with resources. so I just didn't want to

08:40.743 --> 08:50.215
lose all the resources, the people, the momentum 
would build up, sure. Now let's talk about the

08:50.235 --> 08:51.617
numbers. New York Command, 1971, how many in the 
420th, how many men and officers did you have and

08:52.338 --> 09:02.090
then when you retired, how many did you have? Well 
the authorized strength was some 4,400. That

09:06.135 --> 09:09.940
fluctuated a little bit, but it was around. 4,000 
people. They were located in four states,

09:12.614 --> 09:16.918
headquarters here at Bryan. There was some little 
change over time. A petroleum unit was moved out.

09:30.510 --> 09:39.398
We gained some, lost some, but there wasn't any 
substantial change during any time I was assigned

09:30.510 --> 09:39.398
to the brigade. And authorized strength Didn't 
vary much. But did actual strength vary? I mean, in

09:44.342 --> 09:47.287
1971 you had approximately 4,400. How many did you 
have? Well, that was what was authorized, and we

09:48.889 --> 09:56.921
were full strength then, and yes, our units 
fluctuated quite a bit. We did pit one against

09:57.081 --> 10:07.737
another, but they ranged in strength from, let's 
say, 70% to some over 100% strength. So we see

10:08.122 --> 10:12.267
approximately a 30% decline then? No, no, no, no. 
I'm talking about individual units. Oh, okay.

10:18.755 --> 10:27.185
When I retired, I think that the entire brigade was 
about 90%, a little over 90% strength. So it

10:28.667 --> 10:30.088
declined from 100%. Sure. And actually after the 
90th Division was deactivated, it was up well over

10:32.511 --> 10:38.078
100%. You see with the overstrength that they 
picked up from the 90th division and it had

10:38.260 --> 10:49.776
declined to somewhere in the lower 90s in 
strength. Okay, then the end of the draft and the

10:50.477 --> 10:59.931
all-volunteer service then didn't seem to have 
that much of a manpower impact on your command, did

10:50.477 --> 10:59.931
it? Well, it had a strong impact because it took so 
much of our attention, so much of our resources to

11:00.974 --> 11:11.087
maintain recruiting and retention effort. Oh, I 
see. To keep your numbers up. Yes, to keep the

11:14.131 --> 11:15.433
numbers up. And we had our retention rate on 
reenlistment

11:31.062 --> 11:40.091
Now I'm wondering about the relations that your 
reserve unit, engineering unit had with the

11:31.062 --> 11:40.091
regular Corps of Engineers. Can you tell me about 
that? Well sure, we of course were commanded by the

11:43.114 --> 11:57.188
Army Readiness Region and the Fifth Army, For 
technical purposes, we were affiliated directly

11:57.488 --> 12:14.223
with the chief engineers, so we were

11:57.488 --> 12:14.223
authorized to maintain liaison with the chief 
engineers. The chief engineers would have a

12:14.363 --> 12:26.854
meeting every year of all of the major commanders 
of the Army Reserve units.

12:27.273 --> 12:32.039
We're affiliated with the Corps Engineer at Fort 
Hood.

12:34.983 --> 12:42.813
We were fairly free to establish liaison with 
engineer units as needed or required. Did you ever

12:44.455 --> 12:55.609
do any work in this area on any of the Corps of 
Engineer projects like Somerville or anything

12:44.455 --> 12:55.609
like that?

12:56.770 --> 13:08.201
We used the Lake Somerville reservoir area 
sometimes for weekend exercises, but as far as

12:56.770 --> 13:08.201
construction projects there, we did not. There 
are 19 core reservoirs in this state. We did have

13:13.587 --> 13:26.119
liaison with the Dallas region, let's see, Dallas 
region, Fort Worth region, Dallas District

13:27.483 --> 13:29.746
Engineers. This is a construction supervision 
group. We established liaison with them and we did

13:35.052 --> 13:41.621
some projects for them but not at Fort Somerville. 
We drilled some wells. We have well running

13:42.662 --> 13:54.176
detachment and we have drilled some wells for them 
where they would furnish the materials and we

13:42.662 --> 13:54.176
would use our equipment. And we've done some other 
minor construction projects on Corps of

13:55.732 --> 13:59.718
Engineers reservoirs. For instance, Canyon 
Lake. We did quite a bit of construction around

14:02.722 --> 14:12.116
Canyon Lake when we had units at Camp Willis. And 
actually we had some that did their entire two

14:13.578 --> 14:19.427
weeks of training right at Canyon

14:23.508 --> 14:25.931
We had a very wide variety of things. I know one year 
we were at Fort Chaffee. We drilled a water well for

14:28.193 --> 14:36.503
one of the little towns near Fort Chaffee.

14:36.523 --> 14:46.234
Now during the years that you were in command, 
there was a great change going on in American

14:36.523 --> 14:46.234
society, especially toward women and blacks. 
Were there more women and more blacks came into the

14:46.254 --> 14:52.722
reserves under your command during those years? 
Well early on during my command we were very

14:55.019 --> 15:01.145
successful in recruiting women.

15:03.808 --> 15:09.234
There were certain military occupational 
specialties that we were authorized to assign

15:03.808 --> 15:09.234
them to. After a year of fairly good success at that 
we had an about face on policy and we had to to

15:24.072 --> 15:27.177
relieve the women assigned to our combat units. 
For instance, our combat battalion in Arkansas

15:27.237 --> 15:36.030
had maybe as many as 75 women altogether. We were 
required to reassign them to headquarters units

15:37.773 --> 15:43.782
and non-combat type units. So as reservists, you 
had assigned women to combat units? Yes. And what?

15:50.423 --> 15:51.305
What year's release? Non-combat military 
occupational specialties in combat units. Oh, I

15:55.170 --> 15:55.710
see. I see. OK, so what kind of specialty would they 
do? What non-combat specialty would they do in

15:59.275 --> 16:02.379
these combat units? Clerk, supply specialists. 
Get the supplies to the mount. Take care of

16:10.750 --> 16:12.372
personnel. Personnel matters, headquarters 
things. Now why were they reassigned? Well it was

16:20.153 --> 16:25.300
policy, a changed policy of the Department of 
Defense and Department of Army.

16:28.244 --> 16:29.525
And they could not do any of it? We thought it was 
related some to the resistance to assignment of,

16:29.545 --> 16:38.917
to admission of women to West Point at that time. It 
was great, great resistance to that at the time and

16:40.299 --> 16:45.666
that's the reason they were keeping them out then 
That's what they were using for the primary

16:46.304 --> 16:54.754
justification is that women were not suitable for 
combat. We thought that was the main thing that

16:56.296 --> 17:02.704
caused them to change their policy about allowing 
these women to be in combat units. As far as blacks

17:04.647 --> 17:10.534
are concerned, that varied quite a lot depending 
upon where the units were located. Some of our

17:12.116 --> 17:15.400
Louisiana units had a fairly high percentage of 
blacks. And to some extent on where the reserve

17:18.244 --> 17:25.134
center was, where our unit was established. If it 
was in a neighborhood that was primarily a

17:25.214 --> 17:36.491
minority neighborhood blacks, well we'd have a 
pretty high percentage of blacks in the units. We

17:36.511 --> 17:44.222
never had any problem with meeting our goals on 
percentage of minorities in units. of course in

17:45.012 --> 17:59.248
our units that were in an area where there was a 
fairly high percentage of Latin Americans, well

17:45.012 --> 17:59.248
we'd have a lot of Latin Americans in the reserve 
unit. Now did those numbers increase over the

18:01.310 --> 18:03.753
years? The number of blacks and the number of 
women? The number of blacks increased The women

18:11.506 --> 18:20.399
increased early, but then after we were denied the 
opportunity to assign combat units, it

18:11.506 --> 18:20.399
decreased. That is the number we had decreased.

18:25.607 --> 18:28.511
Any problems with the blacks or women in the 
reserves? No problems at all with the women.

18:31.936 --> 18:40.669
Actually, the enlistment requirements were 
somehow for female and for male.

18:41.493 --> 18:47.398
I believe they had just a little more 
responsibility and dedication than the Army

18:41.493 --> 18:47.398
Preserve soldier. I was very pleased with the 
performance of the females in the Army Preserve.

18:56.346 --> 19:00.409
The blacks were very variable. In our Louisiana 
unit, a good many of them were category four on

19:00.429 --> 19:11.078
their mental tests.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.415
could barely read and write at all. Some used the 
reserves as a means of getting into the army. The

19:24.404 --> 19:41.503
reserves could take people with lower mental 
qualifications than the active army could, but if

19:24.404 --> 19:41.503
they got in the reserves and then failed to meet 
some of their commitments, like attendance at

19:24.404 --> 19:41.503
active duty for training, after they missed so 
many times the punishment was to put them in the

19:42.665 --> 19:45.309
Army. Really? For a 45 day period or whatever, and 
of course that's what they were looking for

19:46.391 --> 19:50.938
anyway. So we resented the fact that too many of 
them used the reserves as a means of getting around

19:51.098 --> 20:07.204
the stricter requirements for a prisoner in the 
active army.

20:09.260 --> 20:14.327
We did have some problems with the clannishness of 
the blacks and whites. Never any race riots or

20:14.707 --> 20:17.551
anything like that. But I would say that the 
cooperation between blacks and whites varied by

20:19.954 --> 20:32.131
geographical location units.

20:35.796 --> 20:38.980
Cooperation was better or worse in what 
geography? It was worse in Louisiana than it was in

20:39.601 --> 20:44.087
Texas.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.792
Worse in some units in Arkansas.

20:52.477 --> 21:02.609
The higher the percentage of blacks we had, the 
less likely it would that there'd be close

20:52.477 --> 21:02.609
cooperation.

21:02.630 --> 21:05.473
And I'd have to say based upon their background,

21:11.343 --> 21:17.250
leaders in the units would more likely be 80 or 90% 
whites. So I'm sure there was some resentment

21:18.132 --> 21:20.975
about that. Though I'd say that we carefully tried 
to avoid any discrimination on the basis of race,

21:22.837 --> 21:38.397
but we did try to pick the best qualified people to 
be in the leadership roles or for promotion.

21:38.967 --> 21:57.748
due to quite a lot of difference in the background 
and training that the whites were more likely to be

21:38.967 --> 21:57.748
qualified on the basis of education and 
performance in jobs where education was a factor.

22:00.771 --> 22:07.118
What's your opinion of drafting women?

22:10.388 --> 22:15.895
I've had real good experience with women in the 
Army Reserve organizations. I have not had any

22:16.075 --> 22:21.622
experience with them under a combat situation. 
They have been tested that way.

22:27.069 --> 22:36.261
They have, of course, not surprisingly been found 
to be somewhat deficient in stamina and strength.

22:38.384 --> 22:48.981
But as far as dedication and courage and 
performance, I think they're fully up to the men. I

22:49.281 --> 23:04.746
think they tended to play a role, but the ones that I 
was associated with, of course, were volunteers

22:49.281 --> 23:04.746
and they were inclined

23:11.071 --> 23:15.517
I hate to generalize on it 100% because I just 
haven't had that much experience. I'm pretty

23:16.759 --> 23:28.475
certain that in today's environment in the United 
States

23:16.759 --> 23:28.475
that there will be some sort of draft for women as 
well as for men. All of the emphasis on equal

23:29.216 --> 23:36.226
rights, that has to be a reflection of that. Would 
you agree with that? I suppose it would. What about

23:42.937 --> 23:45.440
drafting women into combat roles?

23:49.905 --> 23:50.726
I'm not sure. I have mixed emotions about that. Of 
course we saw them perform combat roles in the

23:52.909 --> 24:00.277
Russian Army and in some cases in the German Army, 
so we know darn well they can do it.

24:03.601 --> 24:09.428
But I'd rather see us under tremendous stress 
before we did that to any great degree. Not only

24:10.707 --> 24:15.232
women, but people my age, too. We saw those served 
in the German Army. We know that in the event of full

24:17.755 --> 24:24.322
mobilization that you're not nearly as selective 
on aid use. We need to take advantage of the

24:25.203 --> 24:30.709
tremendous experience of people that have been in 
the armed forces in that case.

24:35.094 --> 24:36.816
You made it to the rank of general. Perhaps you can 
give me some ideas on this. How does one get ahead in

24:40.409 --> 24:42.091
the military? Is it the same or similar as getting 
ahead in civilian life, or are there differences?

24:50.864 --> 25:00.778
Oh, I think it's the same characteristics

24:50.864 --> 25:00.778
that you would look for in a civilian.

25:04.163 --> 25:07.107
In your career, did you think that Getting ahead 
depended on your performance or help from others?

25:16.317 --> 25:16.597
Both. Your own performance and certainly nobody 
gets

25:17.899 --> 25:31.053
extremely high rank in either military or 
civilian without a lot of help from others.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.739
There has to be, I presume, In any case, some 
element of luck, but it takes a lot of preparation.

25:42.837 --> 25:43.778
Which is more important? Preparation. I forgot 
who it was that said, I found that the harder I work,

25:48.785 --> 25:53.872
the luckier I am. That's a good one. I like that.

26:00.842 --> 26:01.543
That's a good one. Would you have considered 
yourself ambitious? Sure. Still ain't.

26:14.309 --> 26:14.970
In what way? Well, I like to satisfy

26:16.632 --> 26:24.401
myself with whatever I might undertake to do. Can 
be performed

26:25.482 --> 26:34.553
a little above the expectations of those to whom I 
report.

26:36.878 --> 26:39.221
That's a matter of self-satisfaction, I guess. 
Sure. Speaking of your command, again, and your

26:42.125 --> 26:55.844
entire military career, and every man's life 
who's spent a number of years, three decades,

26:42.125 --> 26:55.844
doing something, there's always 
accomplishments. There's also always

26:56.665 --> 26:58.367
shortcomings. Not probably failures, but things 
that you wanted to do that for some reason you just

26:59.028 --> 27:03.915
couldn't do. Would you discuss your 
accomplishments and your shortcomings?

27:13.404 --> 27:34.071
Well, in accomplishments, I have always gotten a 
tremendous amount of satisfaction out of the

27:13.404 --> 27:34.071
progress and recognition of those for whom I am 
responsible, whether on the civilian side or the

27:13.404 --> 27:34.071
military side. So I got a real ego boost when those 
that I might have had something to do with training

27:34.692 --> 27:52.674
have responsibility for to excel and are 
recognized for it.

27:56.599 --> 28:03.568
I'm proud of the performance of the military units 
to which I was assigned. I think without exception

28:04.477 --> 28:16.776
they were above average to exceptional units.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.519
And that gave me a lot of satisfaction. And of 
course the capabilities of units are measured in

28:20.001 --> 28:31.159
fairly in what you would say objective ways by the 
Army. We tested regularly and we were able to meet

28:37.594 --> 28:42.960
the test, so I like that.

28:51.188 --> 28:58.395
I suppose for shortcomings, one of the things I 
hoped to do was to earn for the 420th Engineer

29:00.772 --> 29:19.149
Brigade, such high recognition that the 
Department of Army would designate it as an

29:00.772 --> 29:19.149
engineer command, which would qualify for the 
rank of Major General, Brigadier General. And I

29:21.711 --> 29:23.472
failed in that. Johanna were before me and I tried 
to perform in such a way that of the four major

29:28.919 --> 29:39.096
engineer units in the United States, two were 
brigades and two were commands. We were never able

29:40.438 --> 29:48.973
to arrest one of those commands away from the 
headquarters in Mississippi or headquarters in

29:40.438 --> 29:48.973
Chicago, Illinois. Of course, we consoled 
ourselves that that was politics rather than

29:50.976 --> 29:54.943
merit. I don't know, anyhow we weren't able to get 
the job done and that was a disappointment to me.

30:06.538 --> 30:12.787
Most of the other disappointments I had as it 
turned out in the military proved to be just good

30:06.538 --> 30:12.787
luck. I was disappointed not to be promoted to 
lieutenant colonel before 1953. If I had been, I

30:20.117 --> 30:24.643
would have Probably gone to Colonel earlier and 
served my time in grade and then relieved from

30:25.147 --> 30:36.824
active duty before I had a chance to get a star.

30:40.450 --> 30:54.090
There were two or three instances like that where 
what at the time looked like a disadvantage proved

30:40.450 --> 30:54.090
later to be an advantage.

30:54.796 --> 31:21.394
I'd say other than that, one of my great 
disappointments was getting wounded in a way that

30:54.796 --> 31:21.394
there was really not any excuse for, so I failed to 
wind up the entire combat mission in Europe.
