00:02.292 --> 00:09.380
about the Rice SEU having an interest in expanding their athletic programs in the middle 1920s.

00:10.121 --> 00:14.806
Rice brought in Johnny Heisman, the Heisman Trophy man, as an athletic director.

00:14.826 --> 00:16.969
He was an older man at that time.

00:16.989 --> 00:28.502
And Claude Rothkiew had left A&M to go to Rice prior to that, and that had worked with him for a year or so here.

00:28.482 --> 00:35.949
And Dad was offered a track coach's job at Rice during the 1920s.

00:36.109 --> 00:44.577
And he apparently asked Mother, would you rather live in College Station or Houston?

00:44.657 --> 00:48.381
And I don't know what the answer was, but he did stay here.

00:48.461 --> 00:55.367
But A&M, as in the case of the ex-bible, offered

00:55.347 --> 01:01.637
raise his income to the point that the Rice child would have given, and Dad decided to stay here.

01:03.901 --> 01:21.490
I think Dad felt in the long run that the state universities had so much going for them that the smaller private schools could have their moment in athletics, but in the long run it would be with the state universities.

01:21.470 --> 01:26.400
Under the new head coach, did your dad's responsibilities change after Coach Bible left?

01:26.420 --> 01:26.641
No.

01:27.482 --> 01:36.321
Matty Bell came here as the head coach in football, and Dad liked Matty Bell a lot.

01:36.501 --> 01:37.343
Where was he from?

01:37.443 --> 01:37.944
Do you remember?

01:38.024 --> 01:40.930
He had coached at TCU and done very well.

01:40.910 --> 01:43.557
I didn't know TCU then here, then SMU.

01:43.577 --> 01:45.242
Yeah.

01:45.703 --> 01:51.740
His teams beat A&M with some regularity, and so he came here.

01:51.941 --> 01:55.932
Of course, he really didn't have a chance.

01:55.912 --> 02:19.573
to succeed as a football coach because this this problem that Dix had seen coming came when Matty was here and I sound like my dad talking because it was all first name but but he had

02:21.022 --> 02:31.317
just not the athlete, just not the quality of athlete that you needed to do well, and his teams showed that.

02:32.979 --> 02:50.083
Matty Veldad said was an excellent coach of defensive football, and of course a little offensively too, but he was particularly good in defense, but they certainly needed it because they didn't, they were on the defense most of the time.

02:50.063 --> 02:58.916
In fact, one of the years, one of his... Matty Bell was here, I think, through the 32 season, football season.

03:00.178 --> 03:06.908
And in 1930, Dad's championship

03:08.542 --> 03:13.229
record-setting pole vaulter and Harry Steitler.

03:13.770 --> 03:23.987
Anyway, his senior year, after not being on the football team, went out for the football team and made starting quarterback as a 130-something pounder.

03:24.007 --> 03:29.916
But that just shows what the A&M football was down to at that point.

03:31.679 --> 03:36.186
And your dad, when did he become the track coach?

03:36.166 --> 03:48.412
Dad became head track when he was assistant coach in the spring of 1921, his second semester of his first year.

03:50.116 --> 03:54.225
Then in 1922 he became track coach.

03:54.205 --> 03:58.555
freshman football, freshman basketball, and track.

03:58.676 --> 03:58.916
Yes.

03:59.839 --> 04:03.908
And then he actually just, as time went on, moved entirely to the track.

04:03.928 --> 04:07.256
Now, had he been a track athlete back in college?

04:09.502 --> 04:09.582
Yes.

04:09.562 --> 04:10.343
TO A DEGREE.

04:11.263 --> 04:15.727
HE WAS MAINLY A FOOTBALL PLAYER AND BASEBALL PLAYER.

04:17.329 --> 04:24.935
TRACK WAS NOT AS DEVELOPED AS SPORT, BUT HE WAS THE TENNESSEE INTRESCHOLASTIC FULL-BALL CHAMPION, HIS SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

04:25.696 --> 04:31.201
AND HE WAS A GOOD SPRINTER AND A GOOD BROAD JUMPER, A LONG JUMPER AS IT'S CALLED NOW.

04:31.221 --> 04:38.067
AND I MEAN, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TIMES THAT ARE REMARKABLE, LIKE 10 SECONDS AND 100-YARD DASH.

04:38.047 --> 04:46.538
and 21 feet in the broad jump, but he was basically an untutored athlete.

04:47.615 --> 04:49.457
But he had had track exposure.

04:51.079 --> 04:55.945
But really, his two major sports were football and baseball.

04:57.026 --> 05:01.091
And being the junior man in the athletic department, he got the track teams.

05:01.892 --> 05:05.056
But he stuck with it and developed it and really had a bond career.

05:05.096 --> 05:13.386
His cross-country and track teams won as many championships as the rest of the athletic department put together in the years he coached.

05:13.366 --> 05:18.316
And in the 30s, the track was around Kyle Field.

05:18.396 --> 05:19.899
That's correct.

05:19.919 --> 05:23.146
So the track meets were held there in the stadium.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.877
In terms of personal joy and satisfaction,

05:28.857 --> 05:32.983
Did it become his special joy?

05:33.063 --> 05:33.964
Yes, it was.

05:34.165 --> 05:35.026
Yes, it was.

05:35.046 --> 05:38.511
He always retained an interest in football.

05:39.292 --> 05:48.265
I remember sitting by him at games, and you could tell he was really one step ahead of most athletes on the field.

05:48.285 --> 05:52.772
And I remember when I was a high school boy playing football,

05:52.752 --> 05:57.318
my junior and senior year I was starting, and I thought I was a fairly good football player.

05:57.338 --> 06:03.927
And after each game, we would sit around the dining room table, and he would critique my performance.

06:03.947 --> 06:10.657
And I found out that I was not doing quite as well as I thought I was.

06:10.697 --> 06:18.287
As the head track coach, how did he attract outstanding track prospects here?

06:19.550 --> 06:21.973
Well, in the... In the 30s.

06:22.093 --> 06:24.756
Well, actually, let me go back to the football.

06:25.076 --> 06:25.256
Oh, okay.

06:25.276 --> 06:34.887
As freshman football coach, apparently, nearly the total freshman class would show up on the team.

06:36.008 --> 06:46.520
And maybe at one of the initial student indoctrination events, you know, the kids were asked to come out.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.983
He would have 250 boys.

06:48.963 --> 06:51.467
or 200 or something of that sort.

06:51.507 --> 06:57.797
And of course, you spent the first month of practice weaning, separating the athletes from the non-athletes.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.046
But as track coach, he did the same thing.

07:03.106 --> 07:05.149
He went to the student body.

07:05.129 --> 07:11.160
and asked them to come out if they had some ability anyway.

07:11.180 --> 07:24.404
And as a consequence, he developed a great number of athletes who were Southwest Conference caliber, who had had very little, if any, high school experience.

07:24.424 --> 07:28.572
And after the development of Ryan Field, where the freshmen were

07:28.552 --> 07:39.516
after World War II, where they were housed separate from the upperclassmen, he would go out there and speak to the freshman class.

07:39.536 --> 07:47.353
And I can remember a boy who won the mile in 1950 being one of those boys who came out.

07:47.333 --> 07:54.068
All right, were they, so they were in the 30s, they were not giving, A&M was not giving track scholarships.

07:54.088 --> 07:56.754
Yes, or football or basketball or anything.

07:56.774 --> 08:00.863
But they, they, let's make believe that he identifies.

08:01.164 --> 08:03.469
I think that they, the student, the waiter,

08:03.449 --> 08:09.881
Boys made $30 a month, a dollar a day or something like that.

08:09.941 --> 08:11.744
But they actually waited on the tables.

08:12.245 --> 08:12.726
It didn't work.

08:12.846 --> 08:21.542
And I know in one case, Dad kept one of his boys on the track to a hurdler, a very good hurdler.

08:21.522 --> 08:32.473
past the time he would show up for work, and the sergeant who handled the waiters took him off his job.

08:32.753 --> 08:41.782
And so Dad had to pay for his monthly expenses until he could get him back established on the job.

08:41.803 --> 08:43.584
But the point was, they worked.

08:44.165 --> 08:51.192
This was not a cruise or anything of that sort.

08:51.172 --> 08:54.876
Where was, in the 30s, where was his office, his work place?

08:59.320 --> 09:17.998
The offices of the coaches were either in the little athletic department building that was freestanding in front of the stadium, or in some offices in the DeWare Fieldhouse on the front entry side.

09:18.118 --> 09:20.200
There was a row of offices there.

09:20.180 --> 09:25.629
During that period, normally the head football coach was the athletic director.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.212
That was the routine, yes.

09:27.993 --> 09:33.162
Following Coach Bell was that when Homer Norton came?

09:33.182 --> 09:35.466
Homer Norton came then, yes.

09:35.967 --> 09:41.817
Describe Coach Norton in terms of personality and so forth.

09:45.863 --> 09:47.266
Let me tell you a story.

09:48.368 --> 09:48.808
That's good.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.894
About my ophthalmology practice.

09:51.914 --> 09:53.297
Both Homer Norton and D.X.

09:53.357 --> 09:55.341
Bible were my patients.

09:56.042 --> 09:57.505
Because of Dad, I'm sure.

09:58.366 --> 09:59.649
D.X.

09:59.669 --> 10:06.842
was living in Austin at the time, but when he would come over to visit Mother and Dad, he and his wife, then he would have his eye examination in the Homer Norton course.

10:06.822 --> 10:10.468
was living here for some years before he moved to Galveston.

10:10.488 --> 10:18.381
But both of them were at the point of life where, you know, you customarily wear bifocals.

10:19.322 --> 10:21.005
Both were too vain to do it.

10:23.729 --> 10:24.831
That's good.

10:24.811 --> 10:30.478
The ex-bible had separate distance and reading glasses, and he liked to play golf.

10:30.498 --> 10:41.451
And so we fitted him with a little bifocal that had something that was a little round reading part that was about five or six or seven millimeters round.

10:41.491 --> 10:47.739
I mean, much too small for reading a newspaper, but you could at least look at your golf scorecard.

10:48.099 --> 10:52.945
That was his one concession to a bifocal.

10:52.925 --> 11:08.741
Homer Norton was, at that time, this was the early 1960s, or the middle 1960s, was writing common, athletic commentary about football, you know, A&M football games or anybody in the conference.

11:08.761 --> 11:11.828
He was, I think, the Houston Post employed him.

11:11.808 --> 11:14.270
to do this, or the Chronicle.

11:15.311 --> 11:26.261
And so he did get one set of bifocals so he could write his copy down and look down at the field, but he would not wear them otherwise.

11:26.281 --> 11:34.809
But the point is both these two men had an image of themselves that did not involve physical frailty.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.170
Let's live that way.

11:36.190 --> 11:41.815
Now, both of them, I mean, Homer Norton was a rather quiet person,

11:41.795 --> 11:49.767
The ex-bible was not noisy either at all, but probably a little more of a speaker than Homer and Orton.

11:50.368 --> 12:04.690
But both of them were comfortable people to be around, and both were, I think, alert, intelligent men.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.916
In fact, Homer and Orton was really very much

12:08.896 --> 12:12.020
athletic theoretician in many ways.

12:13.381 --> 12:21.671
In fact, I think he had a complexity of plays and this sort of thing that many people didn't have.

12:22.231 --> 12:32.423
When they were both head coaches, Coach Bible at Austin and Coach Norton here and were rivals, were they friendly with each other?

12:32.403 --> 12:34.387
I don't know how friendly they were.

12:35.810 --> 12:40.059
I think they were courteous, but they were rivals.

12:40.239 --> 12:49.298
And in 1939, at the

12:50.257 --> 12:58.930
NM beat Texas here in College Station to win the Southwest Conference and National Championship.

12:58.950 --> 13:03.978
But we were ahead enough where it was semi-comfortable.

13:05.260 --> 13:08.164
And when we were, I think, 13 points ahead or something of that sort,

13:08.144 --> 13:25.748
Homer Norton instructed his team to pull a hideout play, and this meant that one of our boys left the field seemingly, but actually stood just inside the sideline

13:25.728 --> 13:44.817
on the playing field, and a pass was called, and Bama Smith ran down the field, and of course nobody thought he was even legally playing, and he was not guarded or watched, and he caught the pass and ran for a touchdown, which ran the score up a little bit.

13:44.837 --> 13:51.347
After that, the University of Texas never lost to A&M.

13:52.103 --> 13:56.972
College Station or Austin as long as the ex-bible coached.

13:57.873 --> 14:05.206
And so I think there may have been a little bit of a feeling after that.

14:05.727 --> 14:07.430
That somebody had rubbed it in.

14:08.452 --> 14:16.727
If I could chat with your dad about which one he respected the most, what do you think his

14:17.264 --> 14:21.310
Well, as a coach, I think he would have put them on the same level.

14:21.370 --> 14:24.274
He and the ex-bible were extremely good friends.

14:24.555 --> 14:29.061
Homer Norton and Dad were professional colleagues.

14:29.342 --> 14:39.196
And in fact, Dad actually, after his military experience in World War II at active duty, came back and rejoined the physical education department.

14:39.216 --> 14:42.681
And Homer Norton asked Daddy to come back as track coach.

14:42.661 --> 14:45.325
And so, I mean, I think their relations were good.

14:45.345 --> 14:46.587
He came to me as a patient.

14:47.048 --> 14:51.816
But I think it was a professional relation more.

14:51.996 --> 15:02.353
And I can recall when I was sick once, Mrs. Norton brought some very nice vegetable soup over one time, too.

15:02.373 --> 15:06.419
But I mean, these were courteous relations.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.843
And they were neighbors, weren't they?

15:08.863 --> 15:09.985
Yes.

15:09.965 --> 15:12.168
And there was one house between us.

15:12.849 --> 15:17.755
But Dad and Nick's Bible were just best of friends.

15:17.936 --> 15:28.390
And they continued to, you know, each year, Mother and Dad would visit Austin once or twice, and each year they would come over here.

15:28.430 --> 15:33.036
And this was something that, a friendship that continued throughout their lives.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.841
All right, back to the 30s.

15:37.524 --> 15:40.830
You finished high school what year?

15:40.850 --> 15:41.171
1946.

15:41.191 --> 15:41.491
46.

15:42.814 --> 15:44.457
Okay.

15:46.681 --> 15:51.630
Mr. Gilchrist came as dean in the mid-30s.

15:51.730 --> 15:54.535
He came as dean of engineering in 1937.

15:54.515 --> 15:54.996
All right.

15:56.217 --> 15:59.802
Henry is compared to your age.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.726
Henry would be four classes ahead of me.

16:03.207 --> 16:06.070
So when I entered high school, he had just departed.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.333
And I might add that you asked about friends.

16:08.834 --> 16:18.447
The Gilchrist were as close friends as mother and dad had and throughout

16:18.427 --> 16:20.870
their time here and after retirement.

16:20.910 --> 16:25.437
And Mr. Gilchrist, they were both my patients too later.

16:25.517 --> 16:34.810
And in fact, I had him write me a letter of recommendation when I applied to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic.

16:35.231 --> 16:36.092
Oh, my goodness.

16:36.593 --> 16:39.797
Describe the Gilchrist.

16:42.020 --> 16:44.524
Describe them, the husband and wife.

16:44.544 --> 16:46.166
They were an interesting combination.

16:46.246 --> 16:48.349
He was a large man tall.

16:48.329 --> 16:56.180
not overweight, and she was probably about five feet, two inches tall.

16:56.200 --> 17:09.199
He was publicly a quieter person, and she was a very active person, rather very managerial of him, I might add.

17:09.900 --> 17:13.705
He managed the university and she managed him.

17:13.945 --> 17:14.927
That's a good summary.

17:15.047 --> 17:15.147
Yeah.

17:15.802 --> 17:29.181
And Bill Wilchrist was a person who had a lot of... He was a thinker and a planner, and he had plans for N.M.

17:29.201 --> 17:37.573
that were in cases actuated and plans that were maybe actuated after he left.

17:37.553 --> 17:48.943
More than most people realize, an architect of much of what A&M has been in the last 40 years of the century.

17:49.824 --> 17:55.649
His public relations were, I think, best described as abysmal.

17:56.190 --> 17:58.011
At least in cases.

17:58.532 --> 17:59.893
He came to be dean.

18:00.654 --> 18:02.596
Let me qualify.

18:02.636 --> 18:04.417
I won't say they were abysmal.

18:04.437 --> 18:07.560
They were abysmal with some former students.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.623
and some students.

18:10.684 --> 18:22.240
If you went in to talk to them, as some students did, you know, if they hadn't passed a course, I mean, they were not going to expect the grade to get changed by Mr. Gilchrist.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.704
I mean, the grade stood, you know.

18:26.886 --> 18:27.907
And this is the way he was.

18:28.688 --> 18:34.476
I can remember him talking to the head of the highway commission.

18:34.456 --> 18:44.614
long after he retired, he said that if any bid that comes before the commission, the low bid should be accepted if it's of equal quality.

18:44.634 --> 18:48.702
It doesn't matter if the high bid is from New York and the low bid is from Texas.

18:49.844 --> 18:53.010
The best economic one.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.753
And that's the way he was.

18:54.853 --> 18:56.616
And one of the

18:57.862 --> 19:00.786
the sort of paradoxes.

19:02.269 --> 19:03.611
He used to play ping pong with me.

19:03.631 --> 19:09.379
I think he liked me fairly well, and we had a ping pong table on our porch.

19:09.880 --> 19:17.431
And I called him Gibb until my first week as a student at A&M, and it was Mr. Gilchrist after that.

19:17.451 --> 19:19.414
But during the

19:19.394 --> 19:26.230
That fall of 1946, there was a lot of unrest related to the cadet corps.

19:27.252 --> 19:37.656
And I was a cadet in the cadet dorm area, not one of the half of the cadets who were freshmen who were at the

19:37.636 --> 19:50.700
It was a year where a striking comparison occurred because almost 50% of the freshmen who were in the traditional units on campus did not come back the second semester.

19:50.720 --> 19:57.973
And something like six or eight or nine percent at Bryan Field, where the upperclassmen presence was not so much.

19:57.953 --> 20:00.415
failed to come back.

20:01.156 --> 20:09.603
But because of the hazing and all that, there was a legislature investigation that spring in 47.

20:09.783 --> 20:17.730
And during all this unrest, the Cadet Corps marched on Mr. Gilchrist's house.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.532
And I was, you know, I was marched right along in my unit.

20:20.592 --> 20:22.854
I didn't even know where, the freshmen didn't know where we were going.

20:22.894 --> 20:25.116
And I remember he came out.

20:25.136 --> 20:27.758
He hit his, his,

20:28.919 --> 20:35.748
The collar was open, and I don't know if he had a tie on that was loose, but I don't think he did.

20:35.768 --> 20:47.564
And the cadet colonel or someone presented the resignations of all the cadets, not all, but most of the cadet officers.

20:50.128 --> 20:52.531
But he was a resolute person.

20:52.591 --> 20:57.778
He did not back down on what he thought was right.

20:57.758 --> 21:13.379
And I don't think what he did for A&M in the planning and the actuation of the plans behind the scenes was ever really fully recognized.

21:14.961 --> 21:16.503
I have that impression too.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.246
He came here to be dean of engineering.

21:19.286 --> 21:19.767
Yes.

21:19.747 --> 21:23.451
Did engineering kind of need a pickup at that point, or do you know?

21:23.471 --> 21:26.474
Well, I don't know if it did or didn't.

21:26.874 --> 21:28.636
That's why I was so young at that point.

21:29.897 --> 21:47.715
Henry has said, I haven't recorded him yet, just in conversation, he said that they, that he, and he thought his mother agreed with him, that they left a real nice house in Austin, and they moved over here to this little country place, that his dad kind of bribed him by giving him a new bicycle.

21:47.735 --> 21:49.737
Yeah, I heard that, yeah.

21:49.987 --> 21:59.682
They lived on the west side houses where the tennis courts were later, I guess.

21:59.702 --> 22:01.946
And that sort of, anyway, the far west part of the campus.

22:01.966 --> 22:05.091
And they had just a, you know, a wooden frame house, yeah.

22:05.111 --> 22:07.995
Now did, was the, that house that?

22:07.975 --> 22:11.999
that the White House that now stands near the president's house?

22:12.259 --> 22:14.581
Yes, that Mr. Coldest lived in.

22:14.761 --> 22:17.584
That was built specifically for the Gilchrist.

22:18.525 --> 22:19.425
In those early years?

22:19.445 --> 22:24.430
I think Mrs. Gilchrist basically laid out the floor plan and everything.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.392
Now, that was rather unusual, wasn't it?

22:27.213 --> 22:29.374
Nobody else got a... Well, he came here.

22:29.415 --> 22:35.580
He was a state highway engineer and had influential friends.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.662
Were they well accepted?

22:38.148 --> 22:41.974
Were they well accepted by the other families living on campus?

22:41.994 --> 22:43.276
You know, I don't know.

22:43.356 --> 22:53.232
See, they came in 37, and the house that they, a nice house that was built for them was not probably built in 38 or 39.

22:54.194 --> 23:01.405
And then everybody moved off the campus in 1940.

23:01.385 --> 23:04.409
I don't know how well they integrated.

23:04.830 --> 23:08.074
They were good friends with one of Dad from the beginning.

23:08.094 --> 23:21.252
And Dad and Mr. Gilchrist had some attributes that were similar in the sense that both of them stood up for what they thought was right, and I think that they sort of respected each other.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.777
Did you all move, you said, moved off campus in 40?

23:25.162 --> 23:26.624
Did you all move off the campus?

23:26.824 --> 23:27.024
Yes.

23:27.564 --> 23:28.465
Where?

23:28.485 --> 23:30.528
We moved to 501 Fairview.

23:31.549 --> 23:34.972
And Dad bought a campus house and had it moved off.

23:35.032 --> 23:40.118
It was not the one we were living in, but it was the home that the McGinnises lived in.

23:40.178 --> 23:42.500
And McGinnises were very good friends.

23:43.561 --> 23:47.525
And we'd been in the house before, in other words, knew it.

23:48.166 --> 23:55.033
When we got here in the fall of 59, there were still two or three of those old faculty houses

23:55.013 --> 23:58.705
left on the campus, no one was living in them.

23:58.725 --> 24:05.648
Did everybody move out then in 40 and those houses were left vacant during the war?

24:06.320 --> 24:10.890
Most of the houses were moved off.

24:11.271 --> 24:16.983
The university had no use for them, and so they offered to sell them to anybody who wanted to buy them.

24:17.003 --> 24:21.433
And so many of them were moved into various locations in College Station.

24:21.553 --> 24:25.341
What was the reason for that decision to move everyone off?

24:25.321 --> 24:31.497
Haskell, I don't know, but A&M was growing prior to the war.

24:31.537 --> 24:35.227
It hit 6,000 just in about 1941, I think.

24:35.247 --> 24:42.385
And with the student body essentially doubling in eight or nine years,

24:42.365 --> 24:51.824
AND THE FACULTY BECOMING LARGER AND ONLY A FRACTION OF FACULTY COULD LIVE ON THE CAMPUS.

24:52.646 --> 24:54.470
I THINK ALL THESE THINGS FIGURED INTO IT.

24:55.231 --> 24:58.017
PLUS THE FACT I GUESS THE LAND WAS NEEDED FOR OTHER THINGS.

24:58.738 --> 24:58.999
ALL RIGHT.

24:59.540 --> 25:03.428
YOU THEN ARE GETTING READY FOR HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THE WAR

25:05.348 --> 25:13.377
What was your reaction as a bright, highly literate young man about this war?

25:13.457 --> 25:16.040
What did this war seem to be?

25:16.821 --> 25:19.084
Well, maybe I wasn't so bright and illiterate.

25:19.364 --> 25:21.326
Maybe I was more illiterate than literate.

25:21.527 --> 25:23.529
But what did the war mean?

25:23.809 --> 25:28.875
Did this seem to relate to you and your friends?

25:29.918 --> 25:34.083
Well, of course, I entered high school in 1942.

25:35.806 --> 25:48.061
I can remember that President Roosevelt's speech before Congress was broadcast through the PA system, and it was, you know, sort of sobering.

25:48.702 --> 25:49.183
At school?

25:49.423 --> 25:50.765
Yes.

25:50.785 --> 25:54.930
I guess I would have been really in junior high school at that point.

25:54.910 --> 25:57.094
with apparently all the grades.

25:58.075 --> 26:00.259
And that was sobering.

26:00.319 --> 26:09.414
And of course, things like the gas rationing meant that people could only have, you know, four gallons a month or something.

26:09.594 --> 26:16.245
And there was some food limitation too, you know, rationing.

26:16.305 --> 26:20.412
And so these things did make us aware that things were happening.

26:20.392 --> 26:32.687
And my dad received a note, a telegram from the War Department saying that it was interesting, he was a colonel, and that he was given the chance.

26:35.591 --> 26:37.613
He was given a choice of entering the military.

26:37.633 --> 26:38.014
He wasn't.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.016
He had to.

26:40.356 --> 26:44.982
And frankly, the military didn't need a lot of older colonels.

26:44.962 --> 26:50.748
But Dad, and I remember that getting the, Dad getting that and talking, the family talking about it.

26:50.848 --> 26:52.349
He did go on active duty.

26:52.369 --> 27:00.598
But, but, and we were with him in the Carolinas and Tennessee.

27:01.679 --> 27:06.844
And then we came back here and finished high school, consolidated.

27:06.884 --> 27:09.447
But those things, those were aspects of the war.

27:09.487 --> 27:12.690
And I can remember the Victory Garden and

27:12.670 --> 27:21.466
But as far as our just day-to-day life, I think it was just like it would have been otherwise.

27:22.228 --> 27:29.101
You know, we went to school and we had our little parties and we had our friends and we had our athletic events.

27:29.361 --> 27:33.008
Did any of your close acquaintances get called up?

27:32.988 --> 27:33.749
Pretty soon?

27:34.230 --> 27:39.337
Well, I was not old enough to be in that category.

27:39.497 --> 27:41.099
Wasn't anybody next door then.

27:41.179 --> 27:47.548
The boys who graduated from last year in 1945 were called up, I remember.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.011
And I know one who was two years ahead of him.

27:50.031 --> 27:51.814
He was killed later.

27:52.875 --> 28:02.809
He went on duty in World War II, but then went back on duty in Korea and was killed there.

28:02.789 --> 28:14.043
From the viewpoint of a youngster, we had a lot of fun during the war.

28:15.425 --> 28:17.367
We didn't feel a lot of deprivation.

28:18.188 --> 28:20.251
Your dad, you mentioned Colonel.

28:20.872 --> 28:24.156
Had he been in the reserve all?

28:24.136 --> 28:27.701
Dad's military experience was sort of unique.

28:27.761 --> 28:32.026
It was almost the old South vintage.

28:32.547 --> 28:41.298
His college, Mississippi College, had provided a company to the Confederate service in the Civil War.

28:42.459 --> 28:46.144
And I might add, I think about 90 of 110 were killed.

28:49.381 --> 28:58.930
Well, anyway, World War II came along, and of course, as Dad said, you know, we really didn't know what, pardon me, World War I came along.

28:59.731 --> 29:02.534
And, you know, by that time, everything was romanticized.

29:04.055 --> 29:17.849
And so the college then decides, with the support of the president, that it would form another unit, and it formed an artillery battery in the Mississippi National Guard.

29:18.269 --> 29:19.270
It was activated.

29:20.785 --> 29:25.992
And the student body elected its officers.

29:30.579 --> 29:33.703
And Dad was, I think, a private for two weeks, and he was a captain.

29:35.586 --> 29:39.812
I'm smiling because that was what happened at the beginning of the Civil War.

29:39.832 --> 29:41.815
Each unit elected their own officers.

29:43.668 --> 29:52.519
And they had said that being in artillery, you know, there's a technical element there.

29:52.539 --> 30:05.877
And he said that three or four more senior officers were sent from his division brigade, artillery brigade, to Fort Sill, the artillery school.

30:05.897 --> 30:08.460
And all of them failed.

30:12.102 --> 30:19.396
And apparently, that situation in that war, they didn't find them a job running the PX or something.

30:19.476 --> 30:21.119
They left the military.

30:22.482 --> 30:26.470
They were dismissed, or whatever you call it.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.994
And so then they finally got down to Captain Anderson.

30:30.357 --> 30:33.503
And Dad said that each week,

30:34.985 --> 30:36.668
that the grades were posted.

30:37.108 --> 30:43.959
And when you didn't make it, he said that was the most difficult test of his life.

30:44.179 --> 30:44.900
I bet so.

30:45.061 --> 30:48.246
And he passed.

30:48.266 --> 31:01.887
And his commanding officer decided that then that any other artilleryman who went to the school would go through a little preliminary course that Dad taught.

31:02.812 --> 31:10.403
And apparently there was a ceremonial unit in New Orleans that had some three-inch cannons.

31:10.644 --> 31:20.939
This is not 75-millimeter, three-inch, that apparently the Mississippi artillery brigade was allowed to have.

31:21.059 --> 31:25.926
And so Dad set up a little artillery preliminary school.

31:25.946 --> 31:31.975
And the officers who then went, at least I guess most of them did OK.

31:31.955 --> 31:41.408
Anyway, because of this, he was promoted to major and he went to France as the youngest United States Army major.
