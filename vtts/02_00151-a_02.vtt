WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:04.073
Division.

00:05.434 --> 00:08.637
And I met with several people.

00:08.738 --> 00:17.106
I think there was a person named Cliff Ransdale, something like that, that was in the Basic Division.

00:17.206 --> 00:18.908
I can remember speaking to him.

00:19.028 --> 00:21.190
I remember talking to somebody else over there.

00:21.691 --> 00:30.460
But I think reasonably early on I got acquainted with people in agronomy.

00:31.148 --> 00:41.222
By the time I was a sophomore, I was actually working in George Coonsies Laboratory, incidentally, who you remember very well as the former dean of the graduate college.

00:42.664 --> 00:52.358
I started working in his lab, so I probably looked to him more for advice than almost anybody else, but I knew several of the agronomy faculty.

00:52.398 --> 01:00.750
I took introductory soils from a man named Henry or Hank Foth, who was only at Texas A&M three years,

01:00.832 --> 01:04.537
He subsequently went to Michigan State University where he completed his career.

01:04.617 --> 01:12.427
I don't know whether that had anything to do with my emphasizing soils.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.027
Maybe he did.

01:13.047 --> 01:21.498
I thought he taught a very good, well-organized class, and he was a very polished individual.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.666
At that time, dressed far better than the normal

01:28.523 --> 01:34.549
Aggie Wood Dress, Aggie Prof. Made a good impression on me.

01:35.029 --> 01:39.634
So as that first year ended, you go back home for the summer?

01:39.834 --> 01:40.094
Right.

01:41.095 --> 01:41.395
Worked?

01:41.656 --> 01:43.277
Work on the farm all summer.

01:43.798 --> 01:47.501
How did you feel about that first year after it was finished?

01:50.264 --> 01:51.565
Well, I felt good about it.

01:51.826 --> 01:54.268
I was glad it was over.

01:55.930 --> 01:58.412
It felt good to be a sophomore.

01:59.354 --> 02:04.863
But really, you look back on it, and we had a lot of fun.

02:04.923 --> 02:06.125
We made a lot of friends.

02:07.908 --> 02:12.416
It was, on the whole, a pretty congenial bunch of guys.

02:16.864 --> 02:22.493
It was an eye-opener for me in that I'd never...

02:23.823 --> 02:28.029
I'd never really been around someone that was a Roman Catholic.

02:28.169 --> 02:41.287
I probably hadn't seen many people of German ancestry, a few, but just the exposure of people who came from Houston, from Old Country Boy.

02:43.790 --> 02:49.037
So I just found it, I guess, a tremendous expanding experience in terms of

02:49.810 --> 02:54.495
people out there and the kinds of standards and all that people have.

02:54.515 --> 03:01.702
But I never was shaken in my own beliefs what I took there with me.

03:02.022 --> 03:09.550
I got involved with the Presbyterian student group here in the freshman year.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.210
Describe that.

03:11.732 --> 03:17.117
Well, there was a fellow named Charlie Workman who was the leader at that time.

03:17.603 --> 03:22.312
And by Aggie standards, he was a very liberal-minded person.

03:23.975 --> 03:40.725
He got us in contact with a, and somebody told me this man's name the other day, and I'm embarrassed to say I can't remember it, but there was a chaplain at Prairie View who,

03:41.009 --> 03:48.663
Charlie Workman invited up a number of times to have presentations in the YMCA building or in the old A&M Presbyterian Church.

03:50.145 --> 03:56.336
This was by far, far and away, the most educated black man I'd ever encountered in my life.

03:57.759 --> 04:05.312
Certainly made me reassess, I think, some attitudes about things, and my parents

04:05.967 --> 04:22.795
you know, we did have black family on the farm part of the time, and we interacted with that family just like, well, neighbors to be sure, and so I don't think I was reared with a,

04:23.517 --> 04:27.862
to think less of black people than anybody else.

04:27.943 --> 04:34.871
At the same time, what you witnessed was the kids going to a different school and not having contact with them in school and that kind of thing.

04:34.911 --> 04:43.382
And so I think it just built, tended to give you an idea that there just wasn't really such thing as an educated black person.

04:43.970 --> 04:48.975
That man opened my eyes through the years of my undergraduate days here.

04:49.015 --> 04:52.059
But we looked to that as a retreat.

04:52.079 --> 05:03.992
My goodness, we could skip, no, I don't guess we could skip formation, but we could get out of an hour or two of CQ on Wednesday night to go to a church function like that.

05:04.633 --> 05:12.441
And Charlie would have some of the high school girls, generally Presbyterian girls,

05:13.248 --> 05:14.310
that would be there.

05:15.352 --> 05:17.115
You probably remember J.R.

05:17.155 --> 05:25.289
Couch had a daughter who was in College Station High School, and then Brian, there was Harry Statler had a daughter.

05:29.516 --> 05:31.560
Rogers,

05:32.738 --> 05:34.963
Rogers, yeah.

05:36.446 --> 05:39.674
And Adams, families I know you know.

05:40.416 --> 05:48.113
Anyway, those, so it was a chance to mingle with, mingle a little with the opposite sex in addition to going.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.962
And that was a place where upperclassmen dropped handles.

05:52.465 --> 05:58.894
You could speak to, freshman could talk to a senior like just any other person or junior, sophomore.

05:59.474 --> 06:02.939
So it was a, I thought it was a pretty important outlet for us.

06:02.959 --> 06:09.107
Now was there a Sunday night Westminster Fellowship like that?

06:11.671 --> 06:13.073
I don't remember that there was.

06:13.313 --> 06:15.716
Did you attend worship on Sunday morning?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.478
Oh yeah, nearly always.

06:17.559 --> 06:17.899
Where?

06:18.419 --> 06:35.625
Well, I guess I generally went to A&M Presbyterian, but it wasn't uncommon through those years for guys in the outfit to get together and just go as a group some other place, so I attended Baptist Church.

06:36.666 --> 06:42.234
There, I can remember going specifically to it, but I went to A&M Presbyterian almost all the time.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.080
I don't ever remember, well,

06:46.533 --> 06:52.820
Vague memory maybe of being in the first Presbyterian Brine when it was in the old location.

06:53.902 --> 06:55.543
Was there a religious emphasis week?

06:55.904 --> 06:56.465
Yes, sir.

06:57.005 --> 06:57.586
Describe it.

06:57.646 --> 06:58.187
Big time.

07:00.389 --> 07:09.139
Always had, of course it was held in Guyon Hall and they dismissed their release classes to have it usually and it went full week.

07:10.060 --> 07:15.747
Always had somebody that was really good at leading

07:16.452 --> 07:20.057
singing, music, and always had an outstanding speaker.

07:21.339 --> 07:32.694
And to say I can remember any, I remember we had a Methodist minister from Houston one year, can't remember the man's name, who was really, really good.

07:32.834 --> 07:43.108
But Guyton Hall would be full, a couple of thousand people, I'd say, something like that, had 10 that.

07:43.829 --> 07:46.172
Yeah, that was an every year

07:46.895 --> 07:51.583
Now, was the YMCA still a place?

07:51.883 --> 07:55.008
It was still YMCA, at best I remember.

07:55.108 --> 08:00.938
Now, I guess there was a bowling alley in the basement of the Y at one time, but I don't remember that.

08:01.138 --> 08:07.088
I just remember that main floor being set up with a kind of living room type.

08:07.108 --> 08:09.612
Mr. Cashin already retired?

08:11.583 --> 08:12.324
I think so.

08:12.364 --> 08:15.589
I'm trying to remember who the director of the YMCA was.

08:16.250 --> 08:16.850
Short name.

08:17.011 --> 08:17.371
Gay?

08:17.551 --> 08:18.152
Gordon Gay?

08:18.453 --> 08:18.973
Gordon Gay.

08:19.114 --> 08:19.554
That's it.

08:19.975 --> 08:20.476
Gordon Gay.

08:20.736 --> 08:20.916
Right.

08:21.898 --> 08:22.619
He was the director.

08:24.541 --> 08:32.072
I don't remember having any, quote, real activity of YMCA, except I probably went to a few special presentations or something there.

08:32.238 --> 08:37.045
What about that new building on the south side of the drill field?

08:39.628 --> 08:40.289
Was it open?

08:40.750 --> 08:41.251
Yeah.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.093
When I came, I think it opened in 50.

08:43.874 --> 08:46.057
What was your impression of the MSC and all of that?

08:46.077 --> 08:49.703
Well, as I told you, it was the only place on the campus air-conditioned.

08:49.723 --> 08:52.026
The only place that had a TV set, I suppose.

08:52.126 --> 08:55.811
Don't suppose there was another TV on the campus other than there.

08:56.712 --> 09:00.658
I remember they had a lounge where you could go watch TV.

09:01.313 --> 09:14.209
Don't remember doing it very much, maybe for some kind of a special deal, an election results or some such, but oh, it was a fantastic building, fantastic building.

09:15.671 --> 09:22.940
Had one really bad experience there when I was, after I was a graduate student.

09:23.360 --> 09:27.405
They had a major dining room in that area, well, where

09:28.060 --> 09:35.187
As best I can recall, it was about where room 201 is now, very near the main desk.

09:36.929 --> 09:40.192
And my aunt came over one weekend.

09:40.292 --> 09:41.453
I don't remember anyway.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.637
We went to lunch in the MSC dining room.

09:46.798 --> 09:50.582
And we had a table that was rickety, unstable.

09:52.164 --> 09:56.548
And I put my billfold under one leg of that table to stabilize it.

09:56.782 --> 09:58.224
My aunt paid for lunch.

09:58.985 --> 10:01.528
I guess that's my punishment, letting my aunt pay for lunch.

10:01.628 --> 10:03.250
I walked out of there and forgot my billfold.

10:04.111 --> 10:07.334
About three o'clock in the afternoon, I remembered I didn't have my billfold.

10:07.414 --> 10:09.056
I knew exactly where I left it.

10:09.857 --> 10:12.540
I go back, of course, they've cleaned up the dining room and everything.

10:14.763 --> 10:15.964
Never saw the billfold.

10:18.367 --> 10:18.948
It was gone.

10:20.470 --> 10:21.591
Absolutely gone.

10:22.482 --> 10:24.626
It's the only time I've ever lost a billfold in my life.

10:24.646 --> 10:28.833
Never had to put another one under the table leg to balance it either.

10:28.853 --> 10:32.960
And did you get acquainted with the director of the MSC during your student years?

10:35.123 --> 10:35.844
Wayne Stark?

10:39.310 --> 10:40.913
You know, I didn't know him

10:41.163 --> 10:46.792
Real well, to be honest, I didn't think a whole lot of the MSC programs.

10:46.873 --> 11:00.235
I didn't have a lot of time for it, but I guess my main problem was because I really was kind of fond of that Sandra Couch, Dr. Couch's daughter, and Bud Whitney, who was one of the first,

11:02.442 --> 11:04.986
I think he was president of the MSC something.

11:05.026 --> 11:07.710
He was one of the early student leaders in the MSC.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.335
He was in a competition there and he won the competition.

11:10.395 --> 11:15.183
So that probably tainted my view of things a little bit.

11:18.889 --> 11:26.581
You move over sophomore year to the dorm area near the... Duncan Hall.

11:26.601 --> 11:27.122
Duncan Hall.

11:27.142 --> 11:29.125
What was that like then to be a sophomore?

11:32.092 --> 11:36.979
Well, as I say, we were kind of, in a way, we were still freshmen.

11:37.019 --> 11:38.562
We had the lowest thing on the totem pole.

11:38.602 --> 11:43.769
We didn't have to say yes sir and no sir and hit braces and that kind of thing, but we were still pretty low.

11:44.350 --> 11:53.103
But I was, in the previous year, they had two quartermaster outfits, what they called A and B quartermaster.

11:53.123 --> 11:55.587
They combined them when I became a sophomore.

11:56.628 --> 12:00.394
Now, A quartermaster was the athletic and

12:01.977 --> 12:08.125
an academic outfit, and B quartermaster was, quote, the red ass outfit, military.

12:09.427 --> 12:19.940
From my perspective, fortunately for us, the fellow that had been CO for the, I mean, first sergeant for A quartermaster became our CO.

12:21.562 --> 12:27.690
And the first sergeant for the outfit came from B quartermaster.

12:27.710 --> 12:29.993
But obviously he had to function under the,

12:31.255 --> 12:59.355
senior CO and and I would say a high proportion of the seniors in the outfit did come from a quartermaster and they were laid-back bunch and the juniors by and large were pretty laid-back so it was a it was a I would say compared a lot of sophomores I hate it easy because our upperclassmen really were I think they were okay but they weren't

12:59.909 --> 13:02.012
They weren't overbearing in any way I don't remember.

13:02.113 --> 13:06.880
I don't remember anybody facing the board, that kind of thing, in that sophomore year.

13:07.702 --> 13:12.169
I guess it may have happened, but I don't have any knowledge of it.

13:13.190 --> 13:27.233
They used to bowl Coke bottles at the end of the hall, set up Coke bottles at one end of those, you know, you're familiar with those halls and those dorms, those long halls, and they'd set up something like Coke bottles at one end,

13:28.478 --> 13:32.203
Bowl halfway the length of the... What did you use for the bowling ball?

13:32.524 --> 13:34.006
Another bottle.

13:34.026 --> 13:35.327
Oh, oh, oh.

13:35.908 --> 13:39.473
Just slide that thing down the hall.

13:39.513 --> 13:39.934
We didn't do it.

13:40.034 --> 13:41.496
Juniors would mostly do that.

13:41.776 --> 13:42.898
The sophomores got caught doing that.

13:43.338 --> 13:44.720
Who cleaned up the broken bottles?

13:47.324 --> 13:48.165
I expected.

13:48.225 --> 13:50.688
I participated in cleaning up some, sometime.

13:51.009 --> 13:53.752
I imagine sophomores got to clean them up.

13:53.953 --> 13:54.874
What was that called?

13:57.335 --> 13:58.537
Good Bull, I guess.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.940
I don't remember if it had a special name.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.061
That didn't happen real often.

14:02.081 --> 14:03.163
And there was Hall Hockey.

14:03.904 --> 14:05.626
Yeah, it could have been called Hall Hockey.

14:05.806 --> 14:09.051
Yeah, I guess they could have used that term, Hall Hockey.

14:09.351 --> 14:11.634
Yeah, I suppose that's a possibility.

14:12.656 --> 14:13.497
All right.

14:14.198 --> 14:19.745
Describe a football, home football weekend.

14:21.608 --> 14:21.688
Hmm.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.846
But you had to yell practice on Friday night before it.

14:28.428 --> 14:28.969
At what time?

14:30.251 --> 14:30.491
Huh?

14:31.212 --> 14:32.874
Was it midnight in those days?

14:32.934 --> 14:33.915
Yeah, midnight yell practice.

14:34.196 --> 14:37.981
And your first year, you said it was at the Y?

14:38.021 --> 14:40.684
It was always at the Y?

14:40.884 --> 14:44.208
No, at the Grove.

14:45.070 --> 14:45.450
At the Grove?

14:45.490 --> 14:46.872
Had to yell practice at the Grove.

14:47.192 --> 14:47.553
Okay.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.017
Pinky Downs always came out.

14:51.858 --> 14:59.966
and Pinky always had on a loud tie and yell, giga maggies, and throw that tie across the crowd.

15:00.066 --> 15:04.630
I can remember the first one that Bear Bryant had.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.252
Describe that.

15:08.313 --> 15:17.902
Well, if you read the book, which I just did not long ago, it's not a totally inaccurate description.

15:18.002 --> 15:18.743
Of course,

15:19.027 --> 15:21.829
what Bear was thinking during all that time.

15:21.869 --> 15:29.756
But I remember Bear getting out on the stage and shedding his tide and telling us how things were gonna be a lot different.

15:29.776 --> 15:32.339
And the crowd was wild, I mean, absolutely wild.

15:33.500 --> 15:38.284
But we pretty much filled the Grove for yell practice.

15:39.085 --> 15:43.408
And I think that's where we had midnight yell practice all the time I was here.

15:44.129 --> 15:48.713
Were there many young ladies in town for midnight yell practice?

15:49.773 --> 15:51.775
Or was it basically?

15:51.795 --> 15:56.721
I mean, we always, a few guys, and with each passing year, there were more.

15:58.764 --> 15:59.865
But it was basically.

15:59.885 --> 16:08.455
I cannot remember, as a freshman, I cannot remember a fish buddy having a date at a football game.

16:08.555 --> 16:11.899
Now that doesn't mean it didn't happen, but it was a rarity.

16:13.178 --> 16:16.942
Because you had to import girls from T.W.U.

16:17.402 --> 16:20.705
So you went to class the next morning, Saturday morning.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.167
Yep.

16:22.187 --> 16:22.707
Forgot that.

16:22.868 --> 16:23.468
Yeah.

16:23.488 --> 16:25.710
And then as soon as class is over.

16:27.892 --> 16:28.433
You fell out.

16:28.673 --> 16:37.942
I'm wondering if, I don't remember any classes being suspended for football, but we definitely had Saturday morning classes.

16:39.404 --> 16:42.747
I took nutrition from Harry Kunkel.

16:44.110 --> 16:46.592
and we met Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday at 11.

16:46.612 --> 16:54.480
Me and Harry told us from the very first day that we could drop two, we had a quiz every Saturday at 11.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.883
He said you can drop two of them during the semester.

16:57.903 --> 17:05.611
That, in effect, meant when you were taking his class, if you didn't want to miss quiz, you could only miss two Saturdays.

17:07.413 --> 17:08.654
I guess, I guess that's right.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.915
We went to lunch and

17:10.216 --> 17:12.380
went directly to the football game.

17:13.062 --> 17:18.713
I don't think we marched in nearly as much ahead of game time as they do now.

17:19.675 --> 17:24.785
All right, then for court trips, what happened to Saturday classes?

17:28.353 --> 17:28.733
Don't know.

17:29.675 --> 17:30.537
Must have canceled them.

17:31.512 --> 17:32.974
Had to, I guess.

17:33.875 --> 17:34.656
I don't remember.

17:35.317 --> 17:36.339
Did you go on court trips?

17:36.359 --> 17:37.420
Oh yeah, we had to.

17:38.682 --> 17:39.303
Describe that.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.165
There wasn't any choice about going.

17:42.307 --> 17:51.300
Well, we had two every year, depending on who you were playing away from here, but you went to Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston.

17:51.320 --> 17:51.860
Or Austin.

17:52.301 --> 17:53.623
And Austin, yeah.

17:53.643 --> 17:55.165
Those were the court trips.

17:55.185 --> 17:58.810
So how would you get to Dallas or Fort Worth?

18:00.572 --> 18:01.013
Oh...

18:04.250 --> 18:09.739
I guess that freshman year I don't remember.

18:12.123 --> 18:19.655
Most of the time there would be somebody that would have a car and it'd be four or five or six people get in one car and go.

18:20.576 --> 18:26.866
Sometimes I can even, I don't ever remember riding in a pickup, but I've certainly seen others in it, hitchhike.

18:26.886 --> 18:29.751
Sometimes they hitchhike.

18:30.490 --> 18:32.792
I can't remember hitchhiking to Houston.

18:32.852 --> 18:37.557
I remember hitchhiking back from Houston one time on a court trip.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.783
But I guess quite a few hitchhikes.

18:42.803 --> 18:49.450
And to Austin, I really, you know, I just don't have any memory of how we got there.

18:50.211 --> 18:50.791
We got there.

18:51.892 --> 18:57.358
During your four years, that would be eight court trips, how many court trips do you think you probably made?

18:58.891 --> 19:00.614
Well, I'm sure I made two every year.

19:01.194 --> 19:02.737
So you think you made all eight of them?

19:02.757 --> 19:03.398
I believe I did.

19:04.419 --> 19:05.942
I can't imagine having missed one.

19:06.162 --> 19:07.664
Any bad experiences?

19:08.806 --> 19:09.827
No, not really.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.354
Now, where would you all sleep on the Friday nights?

19:17.078 --> 19:20.123
When it was in Houston, I think we'd, I don't think we slept.

19:20.223 --> 19:21.525
I think we'd went down there.

19:22.006 --> 19:26.873
We'd get up early and go down most of the time and come back.

19:27.578 --> 19:32.865
probably sleep four to six in a hotel room someplace.

19:34.527 --> 19:43.579
I know my parents, they probably, they probably had a motel in Dallas one, at least one of the years, maybe both, went there.

19:46.503 --> 19:50.188
Austin, no recollection, don't know.

19:50.248 --> 19:53.873
Probably went over to Austin the morning of the thing and came back.

19:55.017 --> 19:56.699
Most of us didn't have a lot of money.

19:56.999 --> 20:00.563
Do you remember any good bull on court trips?

20:00.583 --> 20:02.304
Any tricks, pranks, jokes?

20:04.587 --> 20:05.067
Not really.

20:08.331 --> 20:10.813
No, those court trips were pretty much a blur.

20:12.695 --> 20:13.396
Silver taps.

20:14.497 --> 20:17.460
What was your first reaction to silver taps?

20:18.000 --> 20:18.541
Do you remember?

20:20.703 --> 20:22.085
We went every time we had it.

20:22.285 --> 20:24.467
We didn't have them near as often as we do now.

20:26.557 --> 20:31.764
Pretty impressive.

20:32.505 --> 20:40.536
Don't remember losing anybody real close to me personally as a student.

20:44.921 --> 20:49.908
Did a typical student take Silver Tap seriously?

20:50.289 --> 20:51.110
Yeah.

20:51.130 --> 20:51.711
Oh, I think so.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.593
Campus was absolutely dark.

20:54.518 --> 20:56.300
I mean, there'd be hell to pay.

20:56.901 --> 20:59.664
I mean, you didn't, there wasn't a light to be seen anywhere.

21:01.086 --> 21:05.951
It was absolutely dark and silent.

21:05.971 --> 21:09.756
I mean, you went there in silence and you went back to the dorm in silence.

21:09.776 --> 21:10.957
Do you remember going to Muster?

21:11.919 --> 21:12.960
Oh, yeah.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.741
Where was it held?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.403
In front of MSC.

21:15.823 --> 21:16.484
Describe it.

21:16.884 --> 21:17.805
Outdoors.

21:20.709 --> 21:21.690
Well, I wouldn't say,

21:22.261 --> 21:25.906
Possibly not a lot different than it is today.

21:25.946 --> 21:28.229
Usually had speakers.

21:28.369 --> 21:34.117
I don't remember the candlelight ceremony per se, but maybe they had it.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.460
They did call the roll.

21:36.680 --> 21:36.940
Yep.

21:37.942 --> 21:39.303
I'm pretty sure of that.

21:43.068 --> 21:51.880
So I suppose in those days to have that thing in front of the MSC and I imagine

21:52.383 --> 22:02.178
that there was always some reference to what the MSC was and the lives of Aggies had given their lives in World War II.

22:03.621 --> 22:07.447
And so I suppose we were very conscious of that.

22:07.787 --> 22:12.795
We were close enough to it that that made an impact.

22:12.815 --> 22:15.319
Because the veteran students were gone.

22:15.940 --> 22:16.781
Yeah, pretty much.

22:16.942 --> 22:17.944
By the time you got here.

22:17.964 --> 22:19.667
Yeah, pretty much gone.

22:19.687 --> 22:22.491
And the Korean War was still underway.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.535
The Korean War was very much with us.

22:25.897 --> 22:36.716
Who were the student leaders, I'm talking about what office or role did they, the student leaders that you and your buddies most respected?

22:38.900 --> 22:40.463
Oh gosh.

22:42.704 --> 22:48.654
Well, the cadet colonel, of course, was a much more prominent individual then than now.

22:51.318 --> 22:55.185
I think we had presidents of student body, but I don't remember any of them.

22:55.946 --> 22:59.332
Court chaplain was usually someone who was pretty much respected.

23:00.013 --> 23:03.278
And I think during those years,

23:03.832 --> 23:11.701
The fellow that was head of the MSC council, directorate, would be a respected student leader.

23:12.181 --> 23:21.452
But for most of us, probably the ones we respected most were the ones that were the leaders in the clubs that we belonged to, technical clubs, whatever.

23:22.753 --> 23:24.975
Well, more technical clubs than anything.

23:26.677 --> 23:27.999
Did you all have a hometown club?

23:28.219 --> 23:30.081
Oh yeah, we had hometown clubs.

23:30.101 --> 23:30.902
Which one?

23:31.051 --> 23:33.354
Well, it would be in Lamar County.

23:33.374 --> 23:35.217
See, what's it called, Lamar County?

23:38.361 --> 23:41.246
It seemed like it was Red River Valley Hometown Club or something like that.

23:41.266 --> 23:43.228
And what did it do other than a range ride?

23:43.248 --> 23:45.712
Not much of anything, but range rides.

23:45.972 --> 23:47.975
Range rides to and from home.

23:47.995 --> 23:52.722
Beam Stallings was in that club when I was in it.

23:53.478 --> 23:54.139
And it did.

23:54.299 --> 23:55.921
We did arrange rides home.

23:56.342 --> 24:05.935
I mean, that was after that, and maybe even in the freshman year, but after that freshman year getting to and from home, I never took the bus again.

24:05.976 --> 24:08.920
Not one more time.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.704
That first experience was enough.

24:11.724 --> 24:13.526
So we'd get rides with people.

24:13.606 --> 24:15.889
I'd catch rides with guys from Paris.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.792
You mentioned Gene Stallings.

24:18.213 --> 24:20.616
Now, he's two years behind you?

24:21.001 --> 24:23.223
Well, let's see.

24:23.263 --> 24:23.964
Is that right?

24:24.104 --> 24:27.648
No, he was in the class of 55.

24:27.688 --> 24:29.550
He was in the class of 56, I think.

24:31.712 --> 24:34.855
And my brother was 57, so he was between us.

24:35.076 --> 24:36.797
I believe Biebs was 56, wasn't he?

24:36.817 --> 24:45.326
He was a senior in, yeah, he was in a senior the first year that Bryant was here.

24:46.407 --> 24:50.772
And describe him, as far as you know, as a student.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.423
Oh, I can't say I knew him real well.

24:53.483 --> 25:03.959
He was a very friendly kind of guy, somebody that was easy to like and talk to and kind of look up to as a person.

25:05.561 --> 25:07.504
Did you know Bobby Drake Keith as a student?

25:09.587 --> 25:10.990
Knew the name, didn't really know him.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.131
He was the other end.

25:12.452 --> 25:14.515
Yeah, yeah.

25:14.535 --> 25:16.037
No, I didn't know him.

25:16.418 --> 25:19.122
There was a fellow named Dutch.

25:20.300 --> 25:25.227
that was also in Quartermaster.

25:25.247 --> 25:26.629
So I knew Dutch pretty well.

25:26.909 --> 25:32.878
In terms of student leaders, Ross volunteers, had Yale leaders, I mean, Yale leaders?

25:33.939 --> 25:36.563
Well, Yale leaders, I guess, were looked up to.

25:39.287 --> 25:48.940
The Ross volunteers, yes, you realize when I was a... Gosh.

25:49.814 --> 25:55.101
I can't remember now, when they exposed the True Texans organization.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.264
Was that while you were a student?

25:57.284 --> 25:58.645
Was that while you were a student?

25:58.665 --> 25:58.766
Yeah.

25:59.366 --> 26:13.184
I'm trying to think whether it was actually when I was, it was while I was a student, but it might have, could have been when I was back here as a graduate student, but I think it was while I was still an undergraduate.

26:13.985 --> 26:15.467
That really,

26:15.532 --> 26:20.860
That really shook up the campus in terms of some people that you really respected.

26:20.880 --> 26:37.084
You found out they were in the so-called True Texans and had used, suspected of using those contacts to get them to rank or position that they had on the campus.

26:37.104 --> 26:42.332
So that was a kind of shattering experience.

26:42.818 --> 26:43.542
publicity.

26:44.004 --> 26:46.938
Were you aware that there were any secret fraternities here?

26:46.998 --> 26:47.280
No.

26:49.209 --> 26:51.259
I never remember hearing anything about it.

26:52.268 --> 26:57.473
And I don't think most of the people I'm associated with anything about it.

26:57.694 --> 27:12.389
In all of these interviews, and I feel sure that I've interviewed a few people who probably were members of one of the various groups, nobody knows anything other than they had heard that supposedly they existed.

27:13.130 --> 27:17.314
Because if I'm not mistaken, the stickers

27:18.172 --> 27:23.065
The swastikas goes back into the teens and 20s.

27:23.326 --> 27:25.292
Their symbol was the swastika.

27:25.653 --> 27:31.388
And this is before the National Socialist Party of Germany adopted the swastika.

27:31.408 --> 27:32.772
But it goes way back.

27:33.477 --> 27:36.721
And the TTs, I don't know how far back they go.

27:39.565 --> 27:43.390
See, I had my roommate when I was a senior was in the Ross Volunteers.

27:44.511 --> 27:47.995
And several people in our outfit were in the Ross Volunteers.

27:50.659 --> 27:54.303
I just wish I could remember when that thing was exposed.

27:54.383 --> 28:01.172
I want to say it might have been when I was a graduate student rather than my undergraduate years.

28:02.536 --> 28:06.261
It would have been toward the end of my undergraduate years when it was exposed.

28:07.163 --> 28:13.091
There were people, quote, that presumably were in it that I knew.

28:14.413 --> 28:15.735
But no, I never did.

28:16.316 --> 28:20.582
I don't know if it would ever was clearly established who was a member and who wasn't.

28:20.602 --> 28:31.598
See, when I was a senior year, the cadet colonel of the Corps was Frank Ford, who was an agronomy major, and who I had and have deepest regard for.

28:32.523 --> 28:49.401
And the head yell leader was Presbyterian, who's Presbyterian minister today, by the way, is, oh my goodness, he's, I think he may still be at, Howard Childress was head yell leader.

28:50.900 --> 28:55.065
An Aggie head Yale leader as a minister.

28:55.085 --> 28:56.307
That's a good combination.

28:57.108 --> 28:57.208
Yeah.

28:57.228 --> 29:00.272
And he was in Yakima, Washington, several years.

29:01.113 --> 29:04.677
Last I knew of him, he was in Amarillo.

29:04.697 --> 29:12.868
Were the project houses still in existence and operating as project houses, or were they married student apartments?

29:12.888 --> 29:15.651
No, it was more married student housing at that time, as I recall.

29:16.752 --> 29:17.754
And I remember those.

29:17.774 --> 29:19.175
I remember they were there.

29:19.236 --> 29:20.417
I remember the more

29:20.920 --> 29:29.394
during my graduate student years back because we had married graduate students in the department who lived in them.

29:29.414 --> 29:32.478
So I was in some of those apartments.

29:33.881 --> 29:47.282
Now, what was there at Northgate or Southgate or Eastgate that you and other students would go and enjoy in terms of places to spend money or to have a good time?

29:50.080 --> 29:57.511
I do not remember anything at any of those places that appealed to me.

29:58.954 --> 30:11.032
Now, the Texan and the Triangle were the beer joints, and they were down on South College Avenue where Chicken Oil is now, and what's that?

30:12.775 --> 30:14.417
The Texan was then a drive-in.

30:14.684 --> 30:18.129
Yeah, oh yeah, they were both drive-ins, basically drive-ins.

30:18.349 --> 30:23.877
Well, one of them, the Texan is where, what's the high-priced restaurant?

30:23.897 --> 30:24.918
Oh, that's what it's called now.

30:25.759 --> 30:27.361
The Texan, still called the Texan.

30:28.022 --> 30:30.085
Yeah, I've been in it one time since I came back.

30:30.185 --> 30:33.310
I still remember it as a beer hall.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.072
Was Uncle Ed's?

30:37.162 --> 30:42.513
Hard liquors on Welburn Road in existence in your student days?

30:42.773 --> 30:43.134
Don't know.

30:43.395 --> 30:46.561
There was a liquor store out across the Brazos River Bridge.

30:46.581 --> 30:49.467
Yeah.

30:49.835 --> 30:53.539
The restaurants in later years, we'd like to go to Wormans.

30:53.699 --> 30:56.022
It was out on West 25th Street.

30:56.042 --> 31:04.051
That was a chicken fried steak place, and there was a Zorapi's Mexican restaurant here east on University, off of University.

31:06.334 --> 31:17.547
Clayton's restaurant downtown, well, not downtown, but just past the intersection of Texas and Villa Marie on the left, which is what, Federal Bank or something now.

31:17.527 --> 31:26.958
There was a cafeteria, Hotards Cafeteria was down in the Ridgecrest Townshire Shopping Center.

31:27.078 --> 31:31.142
I think Townshire was built in those years, if I'm not mistaken.

31:31.363 --> 31:33.025
That's the late 50s.

31:33.085 --> 31:34.847
Yeah.

31:35.928 --> 31:41.234
Now, did you and your buddies ever go out to the clay pits?

31:41.875 --> 31:42.716
Yeah.

31:42.736 --> 31:43.456
Describe that.

31:44.057 --> 31:44.918
What...

31:45.286 --> 31:47.711
I couldn't find them now to save my soul.

31:48.352 --> 31:54.264
I can remember going out once or twice when I was a senior, having dates here, go out to Clay Pits Park.

31:54.344 --> 31:55.045
I don't remember.

31:55.787 --> 31:57.410
But they had a reputation.

31:58.192 --> 32:00.516
Clay Pits had quite a reputation.

32:00.536 --> 32:02.620
A place where people went out and drank beer.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.466
Drank beer and parked.

32:05.486 --> 32:07.530
Somewhere south and west of...

32:07.780 --> 32:10.606
Out close to Welburn, someplace in there.

32:10.626 --> 32:12.109
I couldn't find them anyway.

32:13.292 --> 32:24.075
Now, I have never, in asking questions, nobody has ever mentioned any kind of house of ill repute in Brazos County.

32:24.095 --> 32:25.057
Did you ever hear of any?

32:25.358 --> 32:25.418
No.

32:25.398 --> 32:34.111
The chicken ranch did exist in those days?

32:34.432 --> 32:34.912
Yeah.

32:34.932 --> 32:38.117
As far as you were aware, did some Aggies go to the chicken ranch?

32:38.598 --> 32:40.901
Oh, I'm sure, yeah.

32:40.921 --> 32:41.262
You heard?

32:41.302 --> 32:41.582
Yeah.

32:42.203 --> 32:43.305
Oh, yeah.

32:44.180 --> 32:59.525
The, near the end of school, do you remember going through the first time through final review and commencement as a freshman?

33:02.250 --> 33:04.654
I don't know that I went to commencement when I was a freshman.

33:04.674 --> 33:06.717
What about final review?

33:06.737 --> 33:06.937
Oh, yeah.

33:07.038 --> 33:07.779
What was that like?

33:07.879 --> 33:08.500
How did you feel?

33:11.095 --> 33:13.960
Well, it's hard to describe.

33:13.980 --> 33:21.395
I mean, it's just a feeling of real accomplishment, I suppose.

33:23.699 --> 33:30.171
When you're a senior and go through final review, it's probably more sadness than joy.

33:31.554 --> 33:32.175
Why?

33:33.370 --> 33:41.441
Because you know a lot of these guys that you've gone through a lot of stuff with for four years, you walk off that drill field and you're never going to see some of them again.

33:43.524 --> 33:44.625
And that's the literal truth.

33:45.887 --> 33:49.932
I mean, there were about 20 of us in our outfit.

33:51.614 --> 34:00.506
I suppose there are at least six to eight of that group that I have not seen since we separated that day.

34:01.067 --> 34:02.449
Most of us graduated.

34:02.767 --> 34:06.192
on time, and we did graduate in four years.

34:07.153 --> 34:12.201
Now some of us, you know, some of us were in the Army together later.

34:13.142 --> 34:26.361
Some of us have maintained contact over the years, but probably, I'd say, I think there were 21 or 22 seniors in the outfit, and I believe it's fair to say there were probably six that

34:27.083 --> 34:31.387
I've had no contact with at all in intervening years.

34:32.167 --> 34:47.340
Now, I'll admit, probably, you'd say those six might not have been my favorite people or people I had close friendships with, but there were two or three in that bunch that I can think of that I thought a lot of.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.842
We were never, quote, close friends.

34:49.862 --> 34:56.888
We had very different majors, went very different ways, but I respected the person a lot and just,

34:57.678 --> 34:58.619
We've totally lost them.

34:59.900 --> 35:03.184
And I think that realization is there, that you're going.

35:05.006 --> 35:21.945
And, of course, as we were seniors, we were out of the Korean War, and so we really didn't face the imminent danger of death in war, that kind of thing, although that was a specter that wasn't too far from it.

35:21.985 --> 35:22.946
It was kind of Cold War.

35:23.707 --> 35:26.790
It was a specter that was certainly in the back of your mind.

35:28.306 --> 35:42.290
But so it was, yeah, it was a feeling of just supreme elation and at the same time reluctance to give up that which you've had and move to the next level.

35:43.492 --> 35:47.078
Who were the leaders of A&M during your undergraduate years?

35:47.779 --> 35:49.782
The key deans, president, et cetera?

35:51.666 --> 35:54.330
Dean Shepardson was dean of the College of Agriculture.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.143
Did you have any impression of him?

35:57.163 --> 35:58.565
A good man, I thought.

35:58.585 --> 36:01.369
I didn't have a lot of interaction with him at all.

36:02.590 --> 36:08.278
In my last few years, Dr. Morgan was president, David Morgan.

36:09.419 --> 36:11.061
I think he was an outstanding man.

36:11.181 --> 36:12.663
He was probably before his time.

36:14.946 --> 36:21.735
I mean, going back on some, you know, realize he made the Corps optional in 1952.

36:22.070 --> 36:26.214
in the mid-50s sometime in there, and it only lasted, what, two or three years.

36:27.255 --> 36:33.181
But going back on that probably set us back quite a long ways.

36:34.182 --> 36:43.111
I thought he was a very good man, but he didn't have the old Aggie credentials that Earl Rudder did to make the stains stick.

36:44.052 --> 36:47.335
He was an outsider coming in here, and they got him.

36:47.703 --> 36:55.135
But I thought he was, and I honestly can't remember who was, Harrington would be, who was president when I got here.

36:55.175 --> 36:59.281
Morgan came while I was here, and I think he was still president when I graduated.

36:59.401 --> 37:00.543
Gilchrist might have been.

37:03.007 --> 37:05.170
Where was Harrington in this mix of things?

37:05.551 --> 37:09.357
I think Harrington was chancellor, I think,

37:10.096 --> 37:12.819
Had he been president before Morgan came as president?

37:12.839 --> 37:13.559
I believe so.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.903
I believe Harrington was president when I came.

37:16.983 --> 37:18.724
I'm not sure, but I believe he was.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.588
But anyway, I always thought a lot of Morgan.

37:23.109 --> 37:25.371
Did you as a student see Morgan much?

37:25.431 --> 37:26.973
Was he fairly visible?

37:29.936 --> 37:36.542
Well, I think he was relatively visible on campus, but I'd never had any personal interactions with him.

37:39.357 --> 37:47.531
What was it like to try to get a date for an Aggie in an all-male campus?

37:49.293 --> 37:50.796
Well, just virtually impossible.

37:51.677 --> 37:56.285
You weren't lucky enough to get in with one of the local high school girls.

37:57.227 --> 37:59.290
I had a, well, I don't know,

37:59.894 --> 38:03.217
Actually, I was a, I guess you'd say a late bloomer.

38:03.317 --> 38:08.702
I never had a, never really had a date in my life till I was probably a junior down here.

38:09.503 --> 38:13.787
And that was with local high school girls.

38:13.807 --> 38:28.821
When I was a senior, one of the fellows in the outfit was from San Antonio and had a car, got a car, and he would take four of us usually

38:29.510 --> 38:41.191
to San Antonio on a weekend and his girlfriend in San Antonio, they subsequently married and we're still in, she would arrange, quote, blind dates for us.

38:41.211 --> 38:45.058
But usually girls at Trinity because she went to Trinity.

38:45.078 --> 38:47.562
And that was a good time.

38:48.043 --> 38:49.025
We had a good time.

38:49.365 --> 38:51.349
And then his

38:52.021 --> 39:01.537
His girlfriend, I believe, had a car, had access to the family car, so for big events and all, she'd bring girls up from San Antonio.

39:02.559 --> 39:11.193
One experience I had in those years is we went down to San Antonio and they had blind dates for all of us.

39:12.656 --> 39:18.045
And the girl that I had a blind date with,

39:18.802 --> 39:26.433
And the fellow who was really CO of our outfit, but senior, anyway, he had a date with another girl.

39:26.453 --> 39:29.497
Well, they kind of shined each other on a Friday night.

39:29.557 --> 39:31.280
I guess we went down on Friday night.

39:31.941 --> 39:37.629
And so they asked if we could change dates for Saturday night, which we did.

39:37.649 --> 39:39.131
I didn't have much choice.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.936
But they subsequently married.

39:43.102 --> 39:47.706
So they met on one of those blind date weekends.

39:47.726 --> 39:51.189
And I dated the same girl four or five times, I don't remember.

39:51.430 --> 39:56.895
When you and your buddies would go on those blind dates, did you wear your core uniforms?

40:00.017 --> 40:02.179
No, I don't think usually so off campus.

40:02.259 --> 40:04.862
We didn't have to if we were away from the campus.

40:05.703 --> 40:06.744
And I don't believe we did.

40:08.645 --> 40:10.527
Certainly seniors, we probably wouldn't have.

40:12.447 --> 40:16.491
Seniors in those days didn't wear boots like they do today, a lot of places.

40:17.171 --> 40:21.716
And one of the reasons we didn't wear boots, because they didn't fit.

40:22.536 --> 40:26.900
We didn't go down and pay for a pair of custom boots.

40:27.901 --> 40:32.145
When I was a senior, I bought boots from a guy named J.C.

40:32.185 --> 40:32.606
Bryant.

40:33.166 --> 40:41.374
I bought boots, boot pants, shirt, the whole nine yards from J.C.

40:41.793 --> 40:42.615
for $110.

40:42.655 --> 40:47.626
And I had that my senior year.

40:47.726 --> 40:50.452
My brother was two years behind me.

40:50.472 --> 40:56.706
He wore those same boots and pants and shirt and everything and sold them for $120.

40:56.726 --> 41:01.236
So...

41:01.705 --> 41:05.872
We don't have any, neither he nor I have any senior boots we can show you.

41:05.892 --> 41:08.796
These guys have them hanging up in a case and stuff.

41:08.816 --> 41:09.718
But they didn't fit.

41:09.738 --> 41:22.819
I mean they, I've had some of the, I had some of the worst blisters I ever had that senior year and going to these court trips and things where you, or even here, where you had to wear the boots.

41:23.288 --> 41:25.490
Oh, it'd just nearly kill you.

41:25.690 --> 41:33.817
So it's, you know, for me to see seniors that willingly and voluntarily wear these boots to class and things is beyond me.

41:34.438 --> 41:43.386
And, of course, our Kyle Walker just recently was trying to put together $800 for a senior that didn't have money to buy boots.

41:44.647 --> 41:48.490
I thought, boy, they need to, maybe they need to look at the way we got boots.

41:49.831 --> 41:52.013
So, yeah, that was, we made money on the,

41:52.938 --> 41:55.562
But we don't have any souvenirs either.

41:56.503 --> 42:02.091
What were the most popular, during your undergraduate years, the most popular student indulgences?

42:02.912 --> 42:04.174
They smoked tobacco.

42:04.354 --> 42:05.977
What were the popular brands?

42:07.319 --> 42:10.263
Oh gosh.

42:10.283 --> 42:15.370
I think most popular indulgences then is probably the same as it is now, and that's beer drinking.

42:15.450 --> 42:16.772
There were a lot of beer drinkers.

42:16.812 --> 42:20.177
What varieties of beer were Aggies drinking?

42:21.322 --> 42:22.864
Well, Lone Star was one.

42:23.224 --> 42:26.789
I was never a beer drinker, so I don't, I really don't know.

42:26.989 --> 42:34.098
But I remember Lone Star was a popular brand.

42:34.118 --> 42:40.106
And how rare would it have been for there to have been beer or whiskey in a dormitory?

42:46.374 --> 42:51.160
Eskel, I don't, I can never remember seeing it in a dormitory.

42:51.730 --> 43:08.467
I know it had to be there, and maybe I did, but I don't, I mean, I've seen many drunk students, but as far as it being in the dormitory, I don't remember it.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.809
And did the typical students smoke?

43:11.690 --> 43:13.712
No, not in my outfit.

43:15.394 --> 43:21.720
We probably had quite a few smokers, but no, I was just trying to think.

43:24.383 --> 43:26.026
None of my roommates ever smoked.

43:27.849 --> 43:32.416
Well, maybe, maybe the guy from New Mexico smoked some.

43:32.917 --> 43:34.540
He probably smoked when he was drinking.

43:37.024 --> 43:44.817
Had you ever even heard the words of marijuana and cocaine and heroin?

43:46.520 --> 43:46.780
No.

43:48.970 --> 43:55.898
And did you know any Aggies that chewed tobacco or dipped snuff?

43:57.239 --> 43:57.980
Pipe tobacco?

44:01.344 --> 44:01.985
Don't remember it.

44:09.053 --> 44:09.593
Let's see.

44:12.577 --> 44:13.097
Commencement.

44:13.718 --> 44:14.539
Your commencement.

44:15.228 --> 44:19.514
Describe who came and that whole grand event.

44:22.497 --> 44:24.220
Well, I think it was in Guyon Hall.

44:26.462 --> 44:28.085
I'm not even positive about that.

44:30.788 --> 44:35.975
Maybe the commissioning was there and the commencement was someplace else.

44:35.995 --> 44:40.881
My parents were here, my brother.

44:42.464 --> 44:45.510
I don't remember anybody else's family being here.

44:50.781 --> 45:00.861
Well, a real sense of accomplishment for that and, you know, just being able to feel the pride of parents in that and the

45:03.541 --> 45:13.395
I suppose there were more relatives and friends of us as students that were probably here at commencement time than there'd been any time during the four years.

45:16.359 --> 45:29.818
Cora always had this Mother's Day thing that, and I know my brother was the executive officer when, two years later, and I know my mother came down and penned flowers on the kids on Mother's Day.

45:31.402 --> 45:37.308
But I don't believe she came down on that occasion.

45:37.368 --> 45:44.536
So I think there were, she may have, but I think there were more people.

45:44.616 --> 45:49.902
You just felt more of the whole family of accomplishment in that commencement.

45:50.022 --> 45:52.024
I don't remember the commencement address.

45:52.084 --> 45:55.688
Couldn't tell you a thing in the world about who spoke, anything about it.

45:56.123 --> 46:00.689
Was it the kind of commencement you and I know today, every name called, every hand shaking?

46:00.709 --> 46:01.510
Yeah, I think so.

46:01.791 --> 46:02.752
Everybody present?

46:03.293 --> 46:05.095
But I honestly don't remember any of that.

46:06.898 --> 46:07.699
I think I was there.

46:10.443 --> 46:20.997
As you were getting ready to graduate, how well did you think A&M had prepared you to accomplish whatever goals you might set?

46:22.439 --> 46:22.519
Hmm.

46:26.245 --> 46:31.270
Well, I don't know if I stopped to think about it that much.

46:31.530 --> 46:34.474
I think I felt I was prepared.

46:35.975 --> 46:43.022
I didn't have to think very much about what I'd do because I faced the Army immediately, almost immediately.

46:43.603 --> 46:53.333
Graduated some day in May and on the 8th of July, I believe it is, I was in the Army and I was

46:55.253 --> 47:00.383
probably kind of illegal, but I was a commissioned officer in the Army before I was 21 years old.

47:03.169 --> 47:12.527
And I thought what I'd been through at A&M certainly prepared me well for the basic officer's course we had to go through.

47:12.567 --> 47:14.511
That was no real
