WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:05.900
So we talk about what can they do?

00:05.980 --> 00:08.064
What kind of practices could they go into?

00:09.046 --> 00:09.346
Money.

00:09.807 --> 00:11.210
What kind of money should they ask?

00:11.290 --> 00:18.424
Because there is blatant discrimination on offers to women graduates versus men.

00:18.764 --> 00:21.229
I'd face that when I first came out of school.

00:21.209 --> 00:23.092
I could talk to them about that.

00:24.153 --> 00:29.641
What about raising children and being able to practice and so on?

00:29.661 --> 00:36.650
And by then I was meeting a few of the other women that were in the state, and I could talk about this person did this.

00:36.891 --> 00:43.099
And of course I knew them around the country by then, and we could start to talk about different kinds of options that they would have.

00:43.079 --> 00:44.220
Would you ever get married?

00:44.340 --> 00:46.483
Well, about that time I was getting married, too.

00:46.563 --> 00:50.027
So yeah, you know, and it doesn't have to be to a veterinarian.

00:50.047 --> 00:51.649
You can meet other people out there.

00:53.531 --> 00:54.652
Yes, you can have a career.

00:54.772 --> 00:56.554
Yes, you can practice.

00:57.615 --> 00:58.736
Yes, you can have children.

00:59.798 --> 01:11.871
But in following that up over the years, in fact, I chaired a task force for our state veterinary association that, look, women still are the caregivers for children.

01:12.695 --> 01:13.516
It doesn't matter.

01:14.157 --> 01:19.463
But when you look at this generation, they don't want to work 80-hour weeks anyway, male or female.

01:19.944 --> 01:22.967
So the whole generation is changing.

01:23.748 --> 01:33.780
Based on your relationship with those young women, how did they feel they were being treated by their male student colleagues?

01:34.381 --> 01:36.724
Some of them had some real problems.

01:37.765 --> 01:42.010
And some of them didn't or didn't

01:42.597 --> 01:47.782
recognized it and maybe didn't because the men were changing at that time too.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.185
They were now getting used to women being there.

01:51.586 --> 01:54.088
They were also getting used to women on campus, let's face it.

01:54.969 --> 01:56.331
That was a time when there weren't.

01:56.811 --> 02:02.296
So there were some that would come and they would talk about snide comments.

02:02.517 --> 02:09.023
It's still a question that occasionally will still come up within the last year.

02:09.444 --> 02:11.946
I've still talked about it with women students.

02:13.478 --> 02:18.169
Now it's probably more a man's problem than a woman's problem, but it still does happen.

02:18.369 --> 02:22.318
Because there is a female majority in the... It's about 70%.

02:22.679 --> 02:23.861
I can't tell you exactly.

02:23.881 --> 02:26.307
I gave up on keeping track of it.

02:26.327 --> 02:31.318
I think that nationally it's getting close to three to one, female to male.

02:31.298 --> 02:44.055
And as I understand it, one of the problems that some of the public thinks they see is that I can't get a veterinarian to come out to my ranch anymore.

02:44.876 --> 02:52.827
And that when I was at A&M, I remember that it was fairly easy for the guy down the hall to get admitted to vet medicine.

02:53.368 --> 02:57.373
And my son, Billy Bob, now he's got a good B average.

02:57.353 --> 03:04.463
And he didn't get admitted, but some little old bitty girl from Houston that's never seen a bull, she got admitted.

03:04.483 --> 03:06.886
I remember hearing that a number of times.

03:07.266 --> 03:10.190
And I think I understand the reality.

03:10.311 --> 03:13.495
But there's a problem with that that's not totally the reality.

03:14.496 --> 03:16.439
Women would do those practices.

03:17.300 --> 03:26.112
The problem is it's often a spousal thing because there isn't something for their spouse to do out in...

03:26.243 --> 03:27.846
very, very rural Texas.

03:29.528 --> 03:40.145
In addition, it's an economic thing because many of the ranchers are not willing to pay what it costs to sustain a practice these days.

03:41.006 --> 03:52.825
I suspect that many of them have a false memory of what they used to pay, or they forget that the $5 they gave the veterinarian 40 years ago

03:53.007 --> 03:57.196
translated in today's fee would be a little more than they think it would be.

03:57.216 --> 04:01.405
Right, and a lot of farms and ranches are farther apart.

04:01.486 --> 04:08.080
Not that they're bigger, but they've been consolidated into, and maybe they're farming it instead of raising livestock.

04:08.566 --> 04:10.229
Let's see.

04:11.491 --> 04:14.737
We talked about publications and so forth.

04:16.961 --> 04:24.013
The animal behavior is now well accepted, you think, here.

04:24.494 --> 04:25.376
Yes.

04:27.440 --> 04:32.228
Do you remember any kind of outside interference

04:32.208 --> 04:39.618
in what you were trying to do, attempted by any board member, politician?

04:40.860 --> 04:42.122
Relative to animal behavior?

04:42.843 --> 04:42.983
Mm-hmm.

04:43.003 --> 04:44.625
Or to veterinary medicine?

04:44.685 --> 04:44.986
Either one.

04:45.467 --> 04:45.967
Oh, yes.

04:45.987 --> 04:47.710
There's lots of outside interference.

04:48.311 --> 04:48.951
But you know what?

04:48.971 --> 04:50.193
I'm a stubborn Swede.

04:50.894 --> 05:00.848
And I'd put my head down, and instead of going straight into the brick wall again, I'd do an end runaround, and sure enough, if I look at

05:02.347 --> 05:04.189
the profession of veterinary medicine.

05:04.670 --> 05:09.476
I was the first woman to be on a committee of the American Veterinary Medical Association.

05:11.638 --> 05:16.764
That came because I started being active in the Women's Veterinary Medical Association.

05:16.844 --> 05:21.810
There's a small group of women that had formed an organization.

05:23.613 --> 05:27.457
Shortly after I graduated, I became president of it, because they needed somebody.

05:27.477 --> 05:29.500
Ah, heck, I can organize stuff.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.200
Sure, I'll do it.

05:30.281 --> 05:32.303
So off we go.

05:32.705 --> 05:36.350
And I just charge ahead and do something.

05:36.490 --> 05:37.331
I don't ask.

05:37.551 --> 05:41.797
I can apologize much easier than I can ask permission, so I go on and do it.

05:42.278 --> 05:47.885
If I figure it's not going to hurt anything, so we decided that I was going to run.

05:47.945 --> 05:50.248
I wanted to run for one of the committees, so I did.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.953
And the first time I didn't get elected,

05:54.423 --> 05:56.627
But I came back, and I ran again.

05:56.687 --> 06:02.396
And pretty soon, I'm showing up on FDA is under pressure to get some women.

06:02.417 --> 06:04.340
Well, where do you find women veterinarians?

06:04.420 --> 06:07.205
Well, let's go to the Women's Veterinary Medical Association.

06:07.505 --> 06:09.108
Gee, she happens to be president.

06:09.148 --> 06:11.211
So you get on one of their advisory committees.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.559
And all of a sudden, your CV kind of gets a little fatter and a little fatter.

06:15.639 --> 06:20.447
And in the meantime, you're adding publications to it and so on.

06:20.427 --> 06:22.830
So I decide I'm active in the state.

06:22.910 --> 06:27.975
I've always, if I, I figure I can do more good from within than I can from without.

06:28.135 --> 06:37.766
So I join, I'm active in, and eventually you become good friends with the people there.

06:37.806 --> 06:42.451
Well, you know, I think I need to, I want to run for this office.

06:44.033 --> 06:44.614
So I do.

06:46.055 --> 06:48.578
And I get elected as a district director.

06:49.604 --> 06:51.766
Maybe it's because nobody else wants to run.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.650
Maybe it's because they know my name better than somebody else's.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.190
I don't know.

06:55.351 --> 06:55.911
I don't care.

06:56.372 --> 06:56.852
I get on.

06:58.174 --> 07:03.720
And then apparently I do a good enough job that those at the next level will vote me in at the next level.

07:04.081 --> 07:18.497
So I've, over the years, climbed through the, essentially, been president of almost, or chair of every committee, council, group, organization I belong to, except the American Veterinary Medical Association, and that's coming.

07:19.253 --> 07:21.295
I'm on the executive board right now.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.799
Probably in about three years or so I may run for president.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.522
All right, now one of your colleagues has been the president.

07:27.542 --> 07:27.742
Yes.

07:28.463 --> 07:29.244
Is there any other?

07:32.627 --> 07:37.552
The national, we've had another in Texas but not at A&M.

07:38.013 --> 07:44.940
We have, it's interesting in town because Texas A&M Veterinary College has had more

07:45.528 --> 07:58.904
and for your information, First Presbyterian has had more state VMA presidents than any other town or church in the state.

08:00.326 --> 08:05.933
And we're headed for more national presidents too.

08:06.014 --> 08:08.700
This one, the typist doesn't need to include either.

08:09.281 --> 08:16.678
Up at Missouri, when I was chancellor, we had a real numbskull, bad guy.

08:17.780 --> 08:19.544
They're called curators up there instead of regents.

08:20.386 --> 08:25.137
He's the CEO of Adams Mart Hotels nationally.

08:25.117 --> 08:33.256
And he first insulted all of the women in what you and I used to call home economics.

08:34.839 --> 08:37.525
Up there it's human environmental sciences, a marvelous dean.

08:38.187 --> 08:42.136
And he, one day at a meeting, he was saying, why in the world do we even continue that?

08:42.216 --> 08:44.020
All they do is teach cooking and sewing.

08:44.810 --> 08:50.078
Well, within a few weeks, he heard enough that he backed away.

08:50.258 --> 08:55.325
And then he said, and veterinary medicine is a waste of money.

08:55.605 --> 08:57.488
All they are are poodle groomers.

08:59.771 --> 09:08.584
Well, that was the finest thing that had ever happened to veterinary medicine in Missouri because every veterinarian came alive, and they got together.

09:09.025 --> 09:12.049
Well, I went to him, and I said, isn't it unusual, sir,

09:12.772 --> 09:30.223
that the president this year of the AVMA is a graduate of this vet school, the chairman of the executive committee is a graduate of this vet school, and Miss America is a senior fourth-year student to be in this vet school.

09:31.886 --> 09:35.152
And he'll like, oh, oh, oh.

09:35.172 --> 09:37.075
Like I've always thought that

09:37.510 --> 09:46.063
Too many people fail to realize in the olden days what a real professional assignment.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.987
There are many that still do not realize that it's a profession.

09:49.107 --> 09:51.791
They think you go and get a certificate after a couple weeks.

09:51.871 --> 09:55.216
I mean, that mindset still does occur.

09:55.517 --> 10:02.587
In all of these many off-campus activities, have you ever been called upon to testify before the legislative committee?

10:02.687 --> 10:02.927
Yes.

10:05.131 --> 10:06.032
Describe that.

10:06.974 --> 10:13.928
The rabies vaccine and the rabies issue in the state is always a concern in veterinary medicine.

10:13.968 --> 10:17.575
I'm trying to think.

10:17.615 --> 10:26.232
It's probably been about, let's see, I was president that year, so it would have been 94 or spring of 95 when the legislature met.

10:26.212 --> 10:34.885
There was a senator who was proposing that rabies vaccine be allowed over the counter so that anybody could use it.

10:35.346 --> 10:40.474
And that was in part a response to the coyote rabies scare that was really spreading throughout the state.

10:41.796 --> 10:54.615
And his argument was that when he was a county agent, he had been allowed at that time to vaccinate against rabies and he felt he did a very good job.

10:55.321 --> 11:06.630
Well, there are a number of reasons that the veterinary profession has a concern about OTC, rabies vaccines, mainly that they don't give it or they don't give it properly and therefore it doesn't work.

11:06.691 --> 11:11.102
And now you've got animals that are not protected that people think are.

11:11.082 --> 11:16.850
So we were fighting very hard to keep rabies vaccine in the hands of veterinarians only.

11:17.832 --> 11:19.895
So we went to testify in front of this committee.

11:19.915 --> 11:22.519
And I was president, so that's my job.

11:22.939 --> 11:28.027
And we brought in a couple of public health people, very, very well-respected individuals.

11:28.948 --> 11:36.479
And finally, after hearing about oil well leases and on and on and on, it came our turn.

11:36.499 --> 11:40.465
So we get in in front of the Senate committee.

11:40.613 --> 11:42.476
We'll get in there and we start testifying.

11:43.397 --> 11:53.252
And during the time when the veterinarians were speaking, every member on that committee would turn sideways, was talking to their neighbor.

11:53.372 --> 11:59.020
They paid absolutely no attention whatsoever, hardly even acknowledged their presence.

11:59.601 --> 12:06.612
Then the senator had brought in one of his constituents who had gone through the rabies series.

12:06.652 --> 12:09.456
He'd lost a couple cows to rabies and he had

12:09.436 --> 12:28.170
been exposed and had gone through that and how terrible it was the whole time that man talked everybody just stood and stared at him it was just oh feed me feed me more of this stuff well it was very obvious we weren't going to get it stopped at that level so we had to work through the state association to get it stopped uh as it hit the house

12:29.213 --> 12:32.402
But it was a, it was an interesting experience.

12:33.926 --> 12:39.542
Very good political experience, which obviously as a faculty member here I can't take advantage of.

12:40.244 --> 12:44.235
But it's something, at least I understand how state government works.

12:45.211 --> 12:50.696
Now I want to pick on you as an advisor.

12:51.838 --> 13:06.552
What advice, looking at the present, what advice would you give to the departmental, you're in small animal medicine, what advice would you give to leadership of small animal medicine looking to the future of the department?

13:10.216 --> 13:15.201
With each new faculty member that comes in,

13:15.569 --> 13:20.638
Look for balance within the total program, not necessarily within the individual.

13:24.985 --> 13:31.196
Allow the people that you have to succeed at what they do.

13:31.597 --> 13:37.527
You become the roadblock between the higher-ups and the faculty.

13:38.772 --> 13:43.558
Because good people are here, good people will come.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.483
Allow them to succeed at what they can do.

13:48.004 --> 13:51.508
Don't ask them to do the things that they don't do well.

13:53.671 --> 13:55.453
And what advice, then the dean?

13:57.176 --> 13:58.798
To the dean, the same thing.

13:59.178 --> 14:06.788
Nurture the department chairs and allow them to do, allow them to

14:08.675 --> 14:13.180
Have their departments flourish without picking favorite departments.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.922
You can pick favorite programs.

14:14.963 --> 14:17.125
That's something that you should do.

14:18.687 --> 14:26.076
But pick those who understand balance within the individuals, but within programs overall.

14:27.518 --> 14:32.944
And pick those that are going to, because of the system that we have at A&M,

14:33.818 --> 14:48.456
I would rather see deans pick department chairs that are administrators rather than researchers or teachers or academicians in whatever sense, because their role changes.

14:50.419 --> 15:03.775
As far as you are aware, are there any programs in veterinary medicine that A&M ought to reach out and bring here, or any new areas of study that A&M ought to attack?

15:04.919 --> 15:10.287
The whole profession changes over time.

15:10.307 --> 15:13.090
Academics is very slow to change.

15:13.992 --> 15:15.854
It is our shackle.

15:19.079 --> 15:32.057
It is important for deans and department chairs to look at ways to change the programs, including the curriculum.

15:34.231 --> 15:49.958
to meet the needs for the present and the future and get rid of some of the deadwood as far as programs, curriculum, courses that are not necessarily current.

15:51.701 --> 15:56.509
We need to bring in the dynamic individuals that can teach those areas.

15:57.471 --> 15:59.715
You bring them in because they're teachers.

16:00.505 --> 16:05.703
Are there any areas that you think need more attention in the curriculum and some that need less?

16:07.831 --> 16:12.507
If we look at the big items for the future of our profession,

16:12.622 --> 16:18.713
Public health, I never ever thought I would say this, but public health is extremely important.

16:19.094 --> 16:27.108
The food issues that the US exports to Europe and around the world are big issues.

16:27.529 --> 16:31.997
Food safety is a big one, but we've got to have the dynamic people

16:31.977 --> 16:39.349
who can make that area exciting, not the dry, boring lectures of the past.

16:40.091 --> 16:44.819
We need to look at the new technologies and so on that are coming in.

16:45.660 --> 16:48.225
How can we incorporate those in?

16:48.765 --> 16:54.335
We don't need the history of why every little bug is called what it is.

16:54.455 --> 16:57.360
We need to know how to approach

16:57.408 --> 17:06.517
microbiology, physiology, in the broad depth of understanding, not in the minutiae of the understanding.

17:06.537 --> 17:08.038
Let's get rid of minutiae.

17:08.619 --> 17:17.767
Some of it's important, but I hate to say it to a historian, a lot of the history is important if you specialize in the area, but not if you're trying to get out to make a living.

17:18.988 --> 17:26.976
Would you have any advice for the university administration relative to veterinary medicine?

17:29.588 --> 17:32.992
Pick the best people for your administrators and get off their backs.

17:35.135 --> 17:39.781
Is the enrollment number here, is that a comparatively appropriate number?

17:40.602 --> 17:46.230
Yeah, the facilities are designed for the number of approximately 120, 830 per class.

17:47.611 --> 17:52.097
You can go a little bit higher, but that's going to really crimp the basic science area.

17:52.798 --> 17:54.280
That's the area that is

17:54.952 --> 17:56.875
probably affected the most by increases.

17:57.737 --> 17:59.821
The clinics can probably use more.

18:00.121 --> 18:04.830
Part of the clinics are unfortunately driven by student power.

18:07.855 --> 18:11.121
I personally would like to see a 13 block

18:11.422 --> 18:18.153
year, 13 four-week blocks, which means we don't have Christmas, we don't have spring break, we go year around.

18:18.874 --> 18:24.203
So you take your vacation when you're off, when those things come up.

18:24.223 --> 18:26.587
That would keep the clinic up and going.

18:27.028 --> 18:30.754
This up and down fluctuation on the clinic is terrible.

18:31.315 --> 18:37.345
It's not good for clients, it's not good for the animals we serve, and it probably,

18:37.325 --> 18:44.036
It isn't really good for students because if you're coming, if you're on a block just before Christmas, you're not going to get much out of it.

18:44.056 --> 18:48.103
You've got state boards, you're gearing down to get numbers of animals out of here.

18:48.484 --> 18:53.792
We don't offer the consistent service we could if we were up 13 months, 13 blocks out of a year.

18:55.055 --> 19:00.143
What has it meant to the College of Retinier Medicine to have a new medical school across the street?

19:03.110 --> 19:09.639
The college has benefited because of the ability to do collaborative, primarily research.

19:09.659 --> 19:10.641
Good.

19:10.661 --> 19:12.183
Can you think of it?

19:12.203 --> 19:15.668
There are a number of people that have joint projects with researchers over there.

19:15.868 --> 19:22.417
And our GI lab, our GI people are one that come to mind.

19:23.298 --> 19:32.391
It probably has helped, I'll say, the basic science area more than the clinical area, although certainly some of the clinical people have been involved.

19:32.590 --> 19:40.442
It has brought money into the medical sciences library that has made that an even better facility than it was in the past.

19:44.188 --> 19:45.891
Those are the biggest areas that I can think of.

19:46.332 --> 19:53.223
From the actual clinical standpoint, there isn't a lot of exchange there.

19:53.683 --> 19:55.546
But they've been good neighbors as far as your country?

19:55.566 --> 19:56.408
Oh, absolutely.

19:57.509 --> 19:59.172
Have you ever considered leaving?

20:00.653 --> 20:02.038
Have I ever considered leaving?

20:02.058 --> 20:04.927
Any serious offers that you considered?

20:06.392 --> 20:10.205
I have had a lot of offers, more for deanships than anything else.

20:10.265 --> 20:11.750
And part of that's affirmative action.

20:11.810 --> 20:12.452
I know that.

20:13.327 --> 20:29.385
And I have looked at it, and there was a time when I was very, very stressed here and not getting support by the departmental administration until my position was moved.

20:30.226 --> 20:31.607
Then I was a happy person again.

20:32.789 --> 20:37.514
I have a tendency to stress myself sometimes too much, so then, ooh, should I leave?

20:37.734 --> 20:38.575
Well, no.

20:40.107 --> 20:47.815
In to truly, seriously consider moving, probably no.

20:47.835 --> 20:50.939
I've toyed with the idea at times.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.380
It looks really good at times.

20:53.662 --> 20:57.206
But I'm really a Texan at heart by now.

20:57.546 --> 20:59.348
So you're a convert?

20:59.368 --> 21:02.191
Oh, I was probably Texan before I came.

21:02.431 --> 21:02.752
Oh, really?

21:02.892 --> 21:03.212
Yeah.

21:04.441 --> 21:06.644
Meaning you decided you were going to like it?

21:07.104 --> 21:07.305
No.

21:08.326 --> 21:11.410
Number one, I could like living most anywhere.

21:12.752 --> 21:15.716
There are beautiful places, there are wonderful things about everything.

21:16.997 --> 21:18.840
I hate snow, however, now.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.221
I've always hated cold.

21:21.643 --> 21:33.739
But my mentality of people are valuable, politeness is appropriate, students are wonderful,

21:35.812 --> 21:36.874
Don't be in a hurry.

21:37.655 --> 21:39.177
That's a Texas way of life.

21:40.259 --> 21:43.124
And those are values that I have always had.

21:43.244 --> 21:46.349
So I probably have always been Texan at heart.

21:48.793 --> 21:54.282
What advice would you give to a new female faculty member today in veterinary medicine?

21:54.302 --> 21:57.347
Get research dollars if you're going to survive in the system.

21:59.032 --> 22:08.581
And unfortunately, I hate to say it, as much as you love teaching, the first years until you get tenure, that's not got, that cannot be your highest priority.

22:10.383 --> 22:14.146
Would you give her any, that's the advice you'd give to any new faculty member?

22:14.166 --> 22:14.747
Absolutely.

22:14.807 --> 22:20.492
Or any advice you'd give to her as a woman in this college?

22:27.139 --> 22:28.380
Yeah.

22:28.748 --> 22:46.015
In addition, I would probably add that you're going to, if you are thinking about raising a family at this point in time, you might have to think very hard about how that could impact your professional advancement.

22:46.467 --> 22:57.750
Unfortunately, hopefully, if I were going to speak to administrators, we've got to look at options for the newer generation that we did not have.

22:58.392 --> 23:00.195
And that is very hard to do.

23:00.235 --> 23:07.851
There are a number of large corporations that are looking at keeping people on this part-time,

23:08.692 --> 23:14.780
Giving them the full benefits but having them part-time rather than having to bring in new and constantly retraining.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.702
That's a model we better look at.

23:17.763 --> 23:33.383
We better look at prolonging the promotion tenure process because faculty women with families have to, in this day and age, they have to be available to their children.

23:34.628 --> 23:39.815
Society demands it, and the next generation is demanding it.

23:40.335 --> 23:48.025
If we want the best as our faculty, we've got to be able to offer those things to them without punishment for doing it.

23:52.351 --> 23:58.138
In general, you seem positive about the quality of the program here today.

23:58.743 --> 24:05.094
The Vision 2020 is the dream for A&M to be in the top 10 publics.

24:07.418 --> 24:11.504
We're certainly in the top 10 in veterinary medicine.

24:13.287 --> 24:19.237
What should the goal be for veterinary medicine 20 years from now?

24:19.257 --> 24:23.164
The goal for veterinary medicine 20 years from now needs to be

24:23.785 --> 24:26.730
State of the art, not antiquated.

24:27.772 --> 24:39.992
It needs to be insightful for what is still coming.

24:41.295 --> 24:45.642
It needs to have addressed the concerns of a new generation.

24:47.950 --> 24:58.737
And it needs to remain active and maintain its one absolute best strength in the whole world, and that's teaching.

25:00.202 --> 25:19.650
As you think about it today in the merit, hopefully promotions and tenure and salary are done on a merit basis, is there an appropriate mixture in the judgment for teaching, research, and service?

25:23.295 --> 25:26.580
I can't speak lately because I truly do not know.

25:27.826 --> 25:36.840
My gut feeling is, and I can really only speak for this department, I have not been to look at the salary book in I don't know how many years now.

25:39.385 --> 25:52.900
My feeling is, and in knowing how past department heads have worked and in listening to what our current department head says, there is a true effort to look at merit of all types.

25:54.021 --> 25:55.443
And that's real hard to quantify.

25:55.463 --> 26:02.691
I know from an administrator standpoint, it is real hard to give a point for the, is this worth one point and this worth two points?

26:03.411 --> 26:04.533
It's very, very difficult.

26:05.013 --> 26:07.536
But in the people that I've seen,

26:07.516 --> 26:13.003
I've seen an honest, dedicated effort to do their best to try and do that.

26:13.303 --> 26:15.526
Oh, good, good, good.

26:17.048 --> 26:18.310
I'm getting near the end now.

26:19.211 --> 26:23.116
How did you become a part of Aggie spirit?

26:23.136 --> 26:27.101
What were your first encounters with some Aggie traditions and so forth?

26:27.241 --> 26:29.104
My first encounter was bonfire.

26:30.926 --> 26:32.848
It's interesting to watch the progress.

26:32.888 --> 26:37.354
The first year that I was down, my mother came down for Thanksgiving.

26:38.077 --> 26:43.405
And I'd heard a bonfire, yeah, it's a little pile of sticks out in a parking lot somewhere.

26:43.425 --> 26:46.170
And then I thought, oh my goodness sakes.

26:46.190 --> 26:51.398
Well, by the time my mother got home, she sat next to an Aggie on her flight out of here.

26:51.999 --> 26:56.946
She was absolutely convinced that her daughter was in the absolute best place in the whole wide world.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.890
Aggie spirit reigns supreme.

26:59.070 --> 27:01.293
Yes, mother, okay.

27:01.313 --> 27:05.620
Over time, looking at those traditions, I married an Aggie.

27:06.005 --> 27:11.925
who was, he called himself a two percenter, but he was an Aggie.

27:12.045 --> 27:14.935
He truly was an Aggie.

27:16.383 --> 27:25.495
You go to the traditions, you go to, I went to, the first time I went to Silver Taps, it was like, wow, we didn't do this at Minnesota.

27:26.257 --> 27:28.339
And then I heard about muster.

27:28.640 --> 27:33.947
I didn't go to muster for, well, until my husband passed away, I didn't go to muster.

27:33.987 --> 27:39.795
And then I said, you know, I have to go to muster because he needed that.

27:43.921 --> 27:45.563
And I got to thinking,

27:46.454 --> 27:52.923
There's not another school in the world that cares about the people that graduated there.

27:54.345 --> 27:56.308
This year, I did muster in Albuquerque.

27:56.328 --> 27:57.590
I've done 25 musters.

27:58.612 --> 28:03.519
And at the end where you light the candles, they varied it just a little.

28:03.619 --> 28:05.642
They didn't light any of the candles.

28:05.722 --> 28:06.944
They called all the muster.

28:08.306 --> 28:11.731
And then they turned on a little bit of a spotlight.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.653
Lights were out everywhere else.

28:13.673 --> 28:15.516
And here are 12 candles.

28:16.610 --> 28:18.997
And they called the names of those 12 youngsters.

28:19.980 --> 28:21.524
And ooh, was that touching.

28:21.925 --> 28:31.513
Because one of the boys from Albuquerque was a red pot.

28:33.721 --> 28:42.013
And across the hallway from him in the dormitory was one of the boys who died and he was in his outfit.

28:42.734 --> 28:47.461
So he could speak truly from the heart of what it all meant.

28:49.044 --> 28:53.350
I was up in Chicago at our executive board meeting.

28:53.701 --> 28:58.512
when I heard about this thing, and boy, all of a sudden, I had my face glued.

28:59.073 --> 29:01.960
And we started talking about the ones that were lost and so on.

29:02.983 --> 29:05.188
And it was real hard.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.052
There was one other Aggie who's there.

29:08.804 --> 29:13.212
And it was real hard for the others to understand the impact that it had.

29:13.252 --> 29:19.864
I think it took an Aggie to truly understand the depth of that reaction.

29:20.726 --> 29:26.917
And so I'd keep sending out stuff, all the tributes and stuff, and I'd just send it out, here, this is what we're about.

29:27.498 --> 29:28.720
This is what we're about.

29:29.206 --> 29:46.990
Because coming as a new PhD from Rice in 1959, I'd seen Aggies misbehave at Rice football games, and I knew they were some kind of backward group, and if I didn't get stuck there more in two or three years, and I tell muster audiences, some of us are converts.

29:49.994 --> 29:54.100
Let's see, what creates all this spirit?

29:59.986 --> 30:03.992
Well, you can always say it's a shared relationship, shared experiences.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.355
And in part, that's true.

30:05.395 --> 30:07.298
And it's experiences that are handed down.

30:07.358 --> 30:09.501
It's not just on the campus.

30:10.282 --> 30:13.287
And the traditions have a big role to play in that.

30:14.569 --> 30:25.707
But I think more than anything, and I've heard this from students that I've had, when they leave,

30:26.480 --> 30:30.346
They know they were loved by the faculty here.

30:31.387 --> 30:33.590
They had good experiences, and students should.

30:33.630 --> 30:35.373
They should be sheltered from everything else.

30:36.434 --> 30:41.522
But they realized that the faculty really loved them.

30:42.663 --> 30:55.201
Now, in the students in the professional program here who got their undergraduate degree somewhere else, do you see them being inundated with Aggie spirit?

30:55.301 --> 30:55.862
Oh, yes.

30:56.298 --> 31:01.837
And I will tell you, when we go to our national meeting, there are always alumni receptions.

31:01.877 --> 31:03.844
Every school has their alumni reception.

31:05.008 --> 31:06.814
Nobody else has Yale practice.

31:10.405 --> 31:16.700
Now, one of the immediate past student president just graduated from our veterinary program.

31:17.602 --> 31:19.808
And she brought one of her colleagues with.

31:20.670 --> 31:26.524
And I tapped the girl on the shoulder and I said, bet you don't have that at your school.
