WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:03.292
Dr. Richardson? You came well, sir. Who are you? 
Okay. My name is Herbert H. Richardson.

00:16.749 --> 00:23.878
Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1930, September 
24, 1930.

00:29.044 --> 00:31.287
Shortly after I was born, family moved to Maine to a 
small town called Bridgeton. Bridgeton.

00:40.336 --> 00:40.816
Bridgeton. About, at that time, 3,000 people. 
Where is Bridgeton? Population. Bridgeton is

00:48.503 --> 00:54.289
approximately 40 miles north of Portland. Okay. 
It's near the Sebago Lake region. We spent a week or

00:57.632 --> 00:59.113
two there. I really enjoyed it. The people were 
nice. It's very pretty up there in Paul.

01:11.847 --> 01:27.970
My father started out as a blacksmith and a 
mechanic, and then

01:11.847 --> 01:27.970
later on when automobiles began to come in and and 
so on, he got into the machine trades. Actually

01:38.604 --> 01:43.891
lived in the small town of Bridgeton early in his 
career. Moved to Massachusetts, where he worked

01:45.753 --> 01:58.750
in the Navy Yard on submarines and other precision 
devices used during the war. and continued in that

02:00.046 --> 02:05.772
kind of work until after I was born, and that was 
during the Depression. There was not a very good

02:07.934 --> 02:23.511
situation down there, so that led him to move with 
the family back to Maine, where he started a small

02:07.934 --> 02:23.511
business doing welding and blacksmith work and 
machine work. Eventually developed that into a

02:25.333 --> 02:29.597
very thriving business designing and building 
snow plows. It was a good market for snow plows.

02:36.232 --> 02:42.079
Motorized on a tractor type device or just the plow 
itself? Mounted on a truck. Developed one of the

02:44.402 --> 02:56.538
first hydraulic systems for positioning the plow 
and the wings that it used to set back snow banks at

02:44.402 --> 02:56.538
the side of the road. Did he patent those? He had 
some patents on hydraulic systems.

03:04.427 --> 03:14.462
So anyways, I grew up, he wanted me to be an engineer 
and wanted me to take over the business. So by the

03:15.925 --> 03:25.099
time I was eight years old, I was working in the 
business operating machine tools. I had to have a

03:26.682 --> 03:29.927
bench to stand on so I could reach the controls. I 
learned welding, machining, all those kinds of

03:31.690 --> 03:37.078
things. I did work in the business part-time all 
the way through high school. During the time that

03:47.434 --> 03:53.263
my father lived in Massachusetts, he worked in a in 
a machine shop called Olmsted and Flint Company,

03:54.391 --> 04:03.981
which is located in Cambridge, adjacent to the MIT 
campus. And he got acquainted with a large number

04:05.803 --> 04:11.809
of MIT students. They used to come over and watch 
him work and shop. And so he developed an

04:18.416 --> 04:22.660
aspiration for me to go to MIT. and become an 
engineer. Well, the high school that I went to had a

04:27.354 --> 04:33.802
total of about 200 students. And no one from that 
school had ever gone out of state to college. And

04:41.051 --> 04:42.974
most did not go to college in state. At any rate, I 
ended up deciding I did not want to be an engineer.

04:52.357 --> 04:54.019
but wanted to go into physics. And so I applied and 
was accepted to Colby College, a very high quality

04:55.240 --> 05:04.349
liberal arts school. Went there against the 
advice of the high school principal, who told me

05:04.409 --> 05:13.858
that I probably wouldn't make it there and should 
go to the University of Maine. So I went to Colby and

05:16.100 --> 05:20.524
had kind of a kind of a hard time because my 
preparation in high school wasn't very good. But I

05:28.336 --> 05:41.130
ended the first semester with a perfect record and 
found out that physics wasn't quite what I wanted

05:28.336 --> 05:41.130
to do and that maybe the old man was right. And so I 
went down to Cambridge and applied to MIT. At the

05:51.436 --> 05:59.969
end of the year, I had a perfect day record at Colby, 
so there was no question about being admitted. And

06:02.133 --> 06:06.519
that's how I started my MIT career.

06:09.364 --> 06:14.231
When year

06:09.364 --> 06:14.231
is that, roughly? It was 1948 was when I started at 
Colby and at 49. And I

06:20.647 --> 06:30.660
really liked it there at the Institute. I did major 
in mechanical engineering. Mechanical

06:33.584 --> 06:36.308
engineering was the next question. What did you 
think you would be doing as a mechanical engineer?

06:40.454 --> 06:42.657
Railroad work at that time? No, designing 
machinery, essentially. But as I went through the

06:47.326 --> 06:51.472
program, my interests changed. And I became, in my 
junior and senior year, very interested in the

06:51.592 --> 07:00.724
emerging area of automatic control. And so I was in 
what they called the Honors Program, which was a

07:02.667 --> 07:17.046
five-year program where you could do one thesis 
and get two degrees. I was offered an opportunity

07:18.663 --> 07:28.617
to work in one of the wartime laboratories, the 
Dynamic Analysis and Control Laboratory. That

07:30.140 --> 07:30.961
was at MIT. At MIT. It was, at the time, doing work on 
guided missiles. And I joined a group that was

07:37.911 --> 07:48.366
developing the electro-hydraulic controls for 
the Meteor missile, which was the first.

07:49.578 --> 07:56.047
autonomous

07:49.578 --> 07:56.047
guided missile. There's another one thing that I 
just finished doing. I was writing a history of

08:00.494 --> 08:02.236
Johnson Space Center. Oh, really? Yeah, that was 
really fascinating. I know what you're talking

08:04.820 --> 08:05.922
about a little bit. Well, this facility had an 
analog computer that was used for trajectory

08:05.942 --> 08:13.312
analysis. It filled a whole floor in one of the 
buildings That kind of computer will sit on our

08:20.543 --> 08:25.248
desks today. Yeah, I remember incidentally 
seeing the computer at Cape Canaveral before NASA

08:25.268 --> 08:33.937
was established, I guess. I had a friend who worked 
down there, and there were four buildings, I

08:33.957 --> 08:39.403
believe, of computers, and they were shooting 
that redstone off. And they had these paper tapes.

08:42.947 --> 08:46.551
And my friend's job was to sit there and read the 
tape and find out when a The vacuum tube, I guess

08:46.987 --> 08:48.989
they were, burned out. He was an engineer reading 
the paper, but that was an incredible array of

08:49.089 --> 08:55.415
stuff. Well, anyway, so I worked in that lab, and I 
was also in ROTC, so I had a military commitment. I

09:05.965 --> 09:13.652
completed my master's degree, and I was planning 
to go on active duty In the meantime, I had gotten

09:13.987 --> 09:17.091
married, and I found out we were going to have a 
child. So I decided maybe that wasn't a good idea.

09:20.336 --> 09:31.631
So in order to avoid going on active duty at that 
point in time, I talked to my supervisor, and he

09:20.336 --> 09:31.631
said, why don't you take the doctoral exams? And so 
I did, and it came out real well. So they offered me a

09:37.059 --> 09:42.947
graduate assistantship,

09:46.505 --> 09:54.056
I stayed on and completed a doctoral degree, 
finishing in 1958.

09:56.679 --> 10:00.004
Did you continue working on that dynamics 
analysis plan? Yeah. And then for a while, for

10:02.648 --> 10:14.284
about a year, actually it was prior to receiving my 
doctorate, I was offered a teaching position and

10:02.648 --> 10:14.284
taught in the control and design area for a year 
while I was still a graduate student. I was a

10:20.300 --> 10:22.002
graduate instructor.

10:24.605 --> 10:28.591
Following that, I went on. You liked to teach. 
Yeah, yeah. I went on active duty, and I was

10:32.937 --> 10:44.473
stationed eventually at Aberdeen Proving 
Grounds, where I worked on the effects of nuclear

10:32.937 --> 10:44.473
weapons

10:47.677 --> 10:51.381
developed some instrumentation and equipment. 
Came back after that, was offered a faculty

10:51.401 --> 10:59.631
position at MIT in mechanical engineering. So 
what year is that, roughly, do you remember? That

11:02.554 --> 11:04.256
was in 59.

11:07.120 --> 11:17.532
And then I just kind of went through the standard up 
through the ranks type of process.

11:21.410 --> 11:35.912
That was a time when universities were trying to 
get out of the military R&D business, and the

11:21.410 --> 11:35.912
laboratory that I had been associated with was 
essentially dismantled. And I changed my

11:37.695 --> 11:50.674
emphasis area from missiles and that sort of thing 
to transportation and industrial fluid power

11:37.695 --> 11:50.674
control. was a participant in the studies that 
were done by the then Commerce Department, which

11:52.088 --> 12:04.805
led to the formation of the US Department of 
Transportation.

12:07.348 --> 12:14.959
Continued working for them in research areas like 
high speed ground transportation,

12:07.348 --> 12:14.959
magnetically. So you stayed primarily in 
research. You hadn't gotten into administration

12:17.222 --> 12:19.485
too much. No, I wasn't in administration. Then

12:22.210 --> 12:40.809
there was an opportunity to go to the Department of 
Transportation to work for the then Secretary

12:22.210 --> 12:40.809
John Volpe as the first chief scientist in the 
department. So I moved to Washington and did that

12:40.829 --> 12:45.774
for two years. Learned a lot about politics and how 
to get things done. in the political environment,

12:52.079 --> 13:01.554
worked all across the agencies of the department.

13:02.174 --> 13:03.476
And your title was what? Chief scientist.

13:12.430 --> 13:20.803
And I got a couple of university programs going 
that continued for more than a decade afterwards,

13:12.430 --> 13:20.803
funding generic type research at universities. 
Did you have any encounters along the way with

13:25.503 --> 13:28.466
Texas A&M at that time? Yes. In fact, that comes 
back to the question you asked me, how did I know

13:30.788 --> 13:37.955
about Texas A&M. When I was doing the work to put 
together this university program, I went all

13:39.116 --> 13:50.807
around the country to the leading institutes in 
The Texas Transportation Institute, which was

13:51.125 --> 14:08.147
headed by Jack Keese at that time, was clearly one 
of the stronger university-based

13:51.125 --> 14:08.147
institutes of its kind, but with a very special 
character. It was very much oriented toward

14:08.167 --> 14:16.357
highway infrastructure, construction, highway 
design, safety. So it was narrow in the sense that

14:17.819 --> 14:20.743
it was just a a small piece of one mode of 
transportation. And it was very, very applied.

14:27.170 --> 14:31.655
There was essentially no basic research going on. 
But yet it was very notable. And that was the first

14:37.301 --> 14:42.567
time I had ever come to the A&M campus. So that was in 
1971,

14:42.587 --> 14:48.233
roughly. I knew Jack Keyes and Cubby Manning about 
the time. They were in Little League with me. We

14:56.900 --> 14:58.522
were coaching Little League or something. You 
knew who those people were. So anyway, coming back

15:00.645 --> 15:08.795
to the MIT situation, after DOT, I was there two 
years. And then I came back to MIT with a lot of ideas

15:08.895 --> 15:17.646
on what MIT should be doing in transportation. 
worked on the establishment of the Center for

15:18.183 --> 15:22.569
Transportation Studies at MIT. And then a year 
later was asked to become head of the ME

15:24.091 --> 15:29.699
department. So I took that over. It was kind of a low 
spot in the history of the department, because the

15:33.024 --> 15:39.493
enrollment was way down. They were talking about 
maybe changing their name to something else. And

15:45.082 --> 15:52.391
there had been a significant reduction in the size 
of the faculty. So things were kind of at a low. And I

15:57.878 --> 16:06.308
guess I was lucky or something, but I was able to 
build the department back up and generate a lot of

15:57.878 --> 16:06.308
new programs. I have some outstanding faculty. I 
was in that job for eight years. And by the time I had

16:13.077 --> 16:26.793
left, I had hired almost half of the faculty 
members on my watch. It was partly due to some early

16:26.813 --> 16:36.064
retirements, making open positions, and partly 
due to the fact the department grew. Very, very.

16:37.659 --> 16:41.343
Was MIT holding their enrollment pretty stable 
during that time? The overall enrollment, yeah.

16:43.605 --> 16:46.808
But there were a lot of shifts.

16:49.530 --> 16:53.154
So anyway, I did that for eight years.

16:57.217 --> 17:05.545
Then I was asked to come into the dean's office as 
associate dean, which I did.

17:08.680 --> 17:18.009
After I'd been in that position for a year, year and 
a half, was when I was first approached by Texas

17:08.680 --> 17:18.009
A&M.

17:18.029 --> 17:29.260
I guess I didn't take it very seriously, but one 
thing, there were almost no nationally visible

17:18.029 --> 17:29.260
faculty members. When I went over the list of 
faculty that was I think only a couple of faculty

17:36.119 --> 17:40.145
members I'd ever heard of. And so it was not a very 
visible college. But finally, the people here

17:49.739 --> 17:53.445
were very persistent. And finally, I did. Who are 
you dealing with, primarily? Well, it was Arthur

17:58.853 --> 18:04.742
Hanson, who was the chancellor at that time, Frank 
Vandiver. Gordon Eaton was the provost. And Jack

18:10.675 --> 18:17.803
Flipsey, who was president of the Research 
Foundation, was very instrumental in convincing

18:10.675 --> 18:17.803
me. Is that right? He is one of the people that I did 
know.

18:24.611 --> 18:35.404
So I finally did come down, and I found it was a 
pretty intriguing situation.

18:35.941 --> 18:37.322
back and forth quite a bit. But in the end, as I 
thought about it, I thought, well, I can stay at

18:37.362 --> 18:43.849
MIT. I've got a real great position here. I'm doing 
well. And I can make an incremental difference.

18:50.175 --> 18:58.644
But if I came to a place like A&M with a resolve to say 
I had to really be something, I could make a major

18:50.175 --> 18:58.644
difference. And that was why I came and had a little 
problem with my spouse. because she didn't even

19:05.472 --> 19:08.557
want to come down and look. Oh, is that right? Yeah, 
she said, Texas, that's tumbleweed and snakes.

19:12.984 --> 19:14.586
Oh, that's a universal thing. Anything to do with 
that. Finally, she said, okay, well, I'll go down,

19:17.811 --> 19:24.541
but if I see one snake, just forget it. I hope you 
call ahead and clear those things out, because

19:24.561 --> 19:30.350
they are here. But she came down, and she... She 
really took a shine to the place. They didn't see

19:34.880 --> 19:35.982
his name. Found out there were, in fact, trees and 
grass. They were always amazed. And then there was

19:42.470 --> 19:47.056
a good opportunity for her in veterinary 
medicine. So she,

19:47.096 --> 19:55.007
at the time, had a couple of master's degrees and 
was going to go on. If we'd stayed there, she would

19:56.328 --> 19:59.813
have gone on at Harvard to get a doctorate. So we 
came down. Oh, I had not realized you were

20:03.252 --> 20:09.341
. So the first thing I did was I recruited Jack 
Flipsey to come over and help me, which turned out

20:09.361 --> 20:21.198
to be a very good move. And then kept Skip Fletcher 
on as associate dean. He knew where all the bodies

20:27.988 --> 20:30.812
were buried, and who'd done what to whom. So as

20:35.455 --> 20:44.905
you know, we integrated the agencies in with the 
College of Engineering. And I was dean and I was

20:44.945 --> 20:52.473
vice chancellor with the agencies reporting to 
me. There was a very destructive relationship at

20:53.474 --> 21:01.423
that time between the engineering experiment 
station and the College of Engineering. And to fix

21:03.293 --> 21:07.137
that, I had myself appointed. I appointed myself 
as director of the experiment station. And we went

21:13.885 --> 21:17.148
about integrating the faculty. We did away. There 
was a lot of duplication of centers. There'd be a

21:24.717 --> 21:30.463
center in TEAS, and there'd be another activity in 
the college. And they were fighting each other

21:30.523 --> 21:32.946
over the budget. We closed a number of those 
centers. And others, like the computer center

21:36.076 --> 21:44.809
that was in Tees, we gave to computer science.

21:44.829 --> 21:47.353
It was kind of a stressful time. Yeah, I can 
imagine. What did you see as your, was it more of an

21:48.735 --> 21:56.167
administrative, structural problem or mission 
that you felt you had here? Or what was your total

21:56.307 --> 21:59.372
sense of the problem? motive or mission when you 
arrived? What was the mission was to develop the

22:01.991 --> 22:29.342
engineering program, the college and three 
agencies, into a first-rate, high-quality,

22:01.991 --> 22:29.342
nationally visible program that would attract 
top-quality students, produce top-quality

22:01.991 --> 22:29.342
graduates, to strengthen the graduate programs 
in particular, to increase the level of sponsored

22:29.930 --> 22:42.662
research, and to generally develop the program. 
So the first step was basically this structural

22:42.682 --> 22:50.168
integration of the various components that would 
form the College of Engineering. Well, form the

22:50.829 --> 22:52.871
engineering program. And what it did, 
essentially, it created a situation where the

22:53.612 --> 22:58.536
faculty Instead of having two bosses who were 
fighting with each other, we had one boss, and that

22:59.191 --> 23:08.604
was their department head. The department head 
was the department head in the college, but the

23:08.624 --> 23:17.336
same person was the division head for research and 
teas. And then we set up some incentives so that the

23:17.356 --> 23:27.730
indirect cost from research programs was used to 
feed back and further strengthen the departments

23:28.486 --> 23:35.615
and the programs. And that worked tremendously 
well. And most of those costs been retained in the

23:42.624 --> 23:46.969
what? In the college or in the extension? In the 
previous situation, the director of the

23:52.316 --> 23:58.003
experiment station had all those monies And used 
them to lodge yes and to reward friends rather than

23:58.658 --> 24:08.211
performers.

24:09.232 --> 24:15.040
So this is just a direct plow back, in effect, to the 
department, depending on the volume of activity

24:09.232 --> 24:15.040
generated by that department. That's right. It's 
what in control we call a positive feedback loop.

24:25.073 --> 24:27.737
The other thing that we did was we established 
clear set of criteria for promotion, tenure, and

24:28.291 --> 24:38.143
appointment, and made sure that all the faculty 
knew about it. We strengthened the review

24:40.006 --> 24:51.941
process, the tenure process.

24:51.961 --> 24:57.167
And the other thing that I did when I first came here 
was establish a a development activity,

24:57.434 --> 25:00.440
fundraising activity.

25:04.850 --> 25:06.393
Who headed that? Well, Kyle Jedeke is the person. 
He's still there. He's a chemical engineer, has an

25:12.466 --> 25:15.392
MBA. And I made a deal with the Development 
Foundation where we pay half the salary and they

25:17.633 --> 25:23.762
pay half the salary. But I got to hire the 
individual. And he physically located an

25:25.685 --> 25:29.190
engineering.

25:31.994 --> 25:33.977
And that worked very well. Raised a lot of money. A 
lot of chairs and a lot of professorships.

25:42.971 --> 25:47.117
Were you, I suppose there were a lot of new 
recruiting going on. Oh, yes. Soon. There was. Did

25:51.132 --> 25:55.016
you sort of personally participate in a lot of 
that? Oh, yes. I know at one level you had. What

25:58.259 --> 26:03.124
about your relation as the deans, let's say, with 
the other structures and deans in the university?

26:04.186 --> 26:05.307
I think it was pretty good. We established

26:05.327 --> 26:16.058
these divisions in any other college that wanted 
it so they could participate. I think the one that

26:16.915 --> 26:21.941
gets the prize for utilizing that best is liberal 
arts. Dan Fallon was just... When he came here,

26:25.805 --> 26:29.389
there was hardly 25 cents in research money. And he 
very astutely used the T's money to leverage the

26:30.210 --> 26:37.958
research activity of liberal arts. In fact, even 
the concept of his paid, funded research was not

26:39.820 --> 26:45.707
very well known in the college of liberal arts.

26:48.927 --> 26:52.572
So that's kind of the situation, I guess. How about 
support from the administration, president, and

26:52.893 --> 26:59.502
so forth? Well, we had, the place had, at least had a 
little money left, and they did make a commitment

26:59.522 --> 27:13.261
of around $13 million in development money over a 
period of about five years. And, yeah, I've always

27:15.564 --> 27:18.428
had good relationships

27:18.779 --> 27:23.425
with the administration. Every now and then 
there's a problem that usually has to do with

27:23.505 --> 27:38.044
money, but overall I think the college had good 
relations with the other colleges and with the

27:23.505 --> 27:38.044
administration.

27:41.048 --> 27:44.432
Were there any new directions you were trying to 
Well, one thing I could tell you by way of

27:45.408 --> 28:07.461
impressions when I first came on the job, I got all 
the department heads together and tried to tell

27:45.408 --> 28:07.461
them a little bit about my style and I expected 
initiative from them.

28:10.305 --> 28:12.208
It was a real quiet meeting. Nobody wanted to say 
anything.

28:18.034 --> 28:23.098
And so finally I said, well, what do you folks want 
to do? What are your ideas? And one of them finally

28:25.861 --> 28:31.967
piped up and said, well, Dr. Richardson, just tell 
us what you want us to do. We'll do it. That was the

28:32.667 --> 28:33.708
Aggie way. That's right. I was just 
flabbergasted. Because where I come from, it's

28:39.293 --> 28:43.377
all prima donnas.

28:45.483 --> 28:51.050
There were some very strong walls between 
departments. There were departments that would

28:51.090 --> 29:02.905
say to a faculty member, I don't want you working on 
this project with, like if you're in mechanical, I

28:51.090 --> 29:02.905
don't want you working on a project in civil 
engineering. Your job is to be working here in this

29:02.945 --> 29:05.489
department.

29:08.012 --> 29:14.460
I remember Dr. Calhoun used to talk about the walls 
of this university. That took quite a while. It

29:17.936 --> 29:29.908
essentially took a new set of department heads, 
many of them brought in from outside, to change

29:17.936 --> 29:29.908
that. I think today there's a pretty permeable. 
You would have done a lot, because my perception is

29:34.873 --> 29:42.220
that the College of Engineering is the strongest 
College of the University. And it was the oldest,

29:44.702 --> 29:49.187
you might say, most deeply established and 
entrenched. And there hadn't, in fact, been a lot

29:49.207 --> 29:53.552
of inbred development here. And so I'm sure it was a 
pretty static world that you would imagine. What

30:01.041 --> 30:05.506
about the, I guess let's move on to the 
chancellorship and so forth. What's happening in

30:05.866 --> 30:10.992
terms of the University? period of temporary 
insanity there where

30:12.170 --> 30:23.461
I decided that I'd be receptive to taking on this 
job.

30:26.124 --> 30:37.696
The A&M system until fairly recent years

30:26.124 --> 30:37.696
has not been what I would call a system. In the first 
place, for many years, as you know, It was really

30:42.781 --> 30:45.785
dominated by Texas A&M University. And so you had 
this situation where sometimes the chancellor

30:46.486 --> 30:53.095
would be the president, or the president would be 
the chancellor. And a lot of conflict as to who was

30:53.115 --> 30:58.842
running things. And strong personalities who 
felt strongly that they should be running it

30:59.603 --> 31:07.033
instead of having a kind of a... I remember I was so 
impressed when Tom Harrington said, you know what

31:07.739 --> 31:25.464
we really should have done long ago is move the 
systems headquarters to Dallas. That's strange

31:25.485 --> 31:27.888
coming from an Aggie. But he had a point, I think, 
and the point was that this conflict might have

31:28.128 --> 31:33.316
been better alleviated. Excuse me. In 1989, when 
we were given these four new institutions.

31:48.102 --> 31:48.662
Which were? Okay, which were Laredo State 
University in Laredo, Texas A&I University in

31:49.744 --> 32:07.648
Kingsville, Corpus Christi State University, 
Corpus Christi, and West Texas State University

31:49.744 --> 32:07.648
in Canyon. and Amarillo. Laredo and Corpus 
Christi were and still are upper division. They

32:17.830 --> 32:21.734
did not have freshman sophomores. Laredo still 
does not have its own campus. Its base is leased

32:27.439 --> 32:32.203
from Laredo Junior College. And West Texas, of 
course, was in difficulty. Their enrollment was

32:36.627 --> 32:38.108
down. Excuse me, was this acquisition, would you 
say, at least in part at the initiative of the A&M

32:39.151 --> 32:50.344
Regents, or what was the attitude there? But I know 
there were conflicts. I would say it was more a

32:53.127 --> 32:58.813
passive act. Let me answer it this way. It was not a 
situation where the A&M system had an overall

33:01.817 --> 33:08.044
long-range strategy. and saw these institutions 
as important components that, if they could be

33:08.665 --> 33:18.255
acquired, would help to promote that long-term 
strategy. There was no long-term strategy for the

33:18.295 --> 33:23.080
system. In fact, what the system mostly did was,

33:23.100 --> 33:37.255
what we call, ensure fiduciary integrity. manage 
the books, carry out audit functions, invest

33:38.095 --> 33:52.435
money for the common good, manage our share of the 
permanent university fund and the AUF. And

33:54.619 --> 34:01.849
together with the regents, hire and fire 
presidents and agency directors.

34:05.113 --> 34:06.195
Beginning... really with Perry Atkinson's 
administration, that there began to be some

34:07.036 --> 34:28.447
long-range thinking about what the A&M system 
should be and what its mission should be in the

34:07.036 --> 34:28.447
state and what areas should it try to emphasize and 
de-emphasize.

34:31.051 --> 34:33.955
And I think Perry Atkinson had some very good 
long-range visions as to what the system might

34:35.352 --> 34:44.203
become in the future. I think felt very strongly 
that the emphasis should really be in engineering

34:44.263 --> 34:59.622
and agriculture because that's the place where 
the system has a good deal of strength. Of course,

35:00.864 --> 35:03.587
those universities that came into the system

35:06.318 --> 35:14.228
at that time did not add a lot to those strengths, 
even though there was some agriculture programs.

35:14.268 --> 35:18.254
A&I has a respectable engineering program. You 
wouldn't say that it had much effect on the overall

35:18.354 --> 35:24.422
activity. So there was a lot of soul-searching, I 
think, out of the board during the time Perry was

35:25.944 --> 35:36.257
chancellor. A study was done, I guess about four 
years ago, was the year before Perry announced he

35:38.515 --> 36:07.898
was going to step down, by McKenzie and Company, 
where they looked at

35:38.515 --> 36:07.898
some indicators for higher education throughout 
Texas and compared compared those indicators

36:08.418 --> 36:24.395
with what was going on nationally and looked at 
various attributes of particularly the

36:08.418 --> 36:24.395
universities that were in the system at that time, 
eight of them, and tried to characterize them.

36:25.456 --> 36:33.345
Were they high engineering, high agriculture, 
low engineering, low agriculture, no

36:25.456 --> 36:33.345
engineering, no agriculture? and what the 
quality was as indicated by the admissions SAT

36:34.068 --> 36:50.724
scores of entering students, kind of came to the 
conclusion that a number of these universities

36:34.068 --> 36:50.724
didn't really fit our system. And I think there was 
some sentiment at that time that the study was done

36:50.744 --> 37:03.737
in part to defend the system against other 
institutions being given to us. So the idea was try

37:04.223 --> 37:24.040
to come up with some rationale so that if

37:04.223 --> 37:24.040
some institution, Sol Ross or whatever, decides 
they want to join, you can say, yeah, that makes

37:04.223 --> 37:24.040
sense, ignore it. No, it doesn't. Well, that study 
was finished. And then Perry announced he was

37:30.045 --> 37:32.948
going and stepped down. So everything was kind of 
put on hold pending the arrival of the new

37:34.089 --> 37:42.798
chancellor. As part of that process, though, 
there had been established a committee, a regent

37:44.520 --> 37:59.695
committee on strategic planning and long-range 
goals and strategic planning headed by Raul

37:44.520 --> 37:59.695
Fernandez. So the mechanism was in place. And when 
Bill Mobley was here with Perry, he had initiated a

38:03.987 --> 38:20.256
comprehensive strategic planning process for 
the whole system. And there had been one

38:20.497 --> 38:21.879
iteration. So that was in place.

38:29.122 --> 38:36.113
When I came over here, one of the first questions 
that I tried to deal with is just that. What is the

38:36.193 --> 38:38.096
A&M system anyway? What do we want it to be? What's 
its mission in the state as compared with other

38:40.139 --> 38:44.926
systems? Particularly, how is it different from 
the UT system in terms of the missions and goals?

38:52.918 --> 38:57.846
And we had a whole series of meetings with the 
Regents Planning Committee, and with our CEOs,

38:58.214 --> 39:05.260
agency directors, and presidents on that issue. 
The outcome of that was a short statement of what

39:05.301 --> 39:18.112
the A&M system is, besides being a collection of 15 
institutions. Do you have that somewhere? Yes, I

39:19.494 --> 39:22.256
do. We also have a vision statement that It 
expresses what some of our values are, things like

39:29.011 --> 39:50.036
being a premier source of

39:29.011 --> 39:50.036
education, research, and new technology

39:29.011 --> 39:50.036
in the state. One question that I guess needs to be 
asked somewhere along here is, are you

39:51.638 --> 39:57.685
cooperating at this point With University of 
Texas, is there any collusion in the sense of joint

39:58.947 --> 40:07.759
planning and development? I wouldn't say there 
was joint planning, particularly. We try to

40:11.424 --> 40:16.992
collaborate pretty closely in the legislative 
session. Which is really relevant to new

40:17.813 --> 40:19.795
development, too. It is. But Cunningham and I at 
Shilkin Lawless have been kind of a coalition of

40:26.268 --> 40:29.431
the big dogs, if you will. And we've met frequently 
and coordinated different kinds of activities.

40:38.319 --> 40:46.787
And that collaboration developed in part because 
of, whatever they were, the financial tensions on

40:38.319 --> 40:46.787
the systems and higher education generally in 
Texas. Because I know every school wanted to

40:46.807 --> 40:56.055
re-enact itself to something to get a portion of 
the available funds, et cetera, et cetera. And we

40:57.554 --> 41:09.004
have some collaborative research programs 
between UT and A&M. In engineering, for instance,

41:10.605 --> 41:27.240
the Offshore Technology Center, NTS,

41:10.605 --> 41:27.240
the Southwestern University Transportation 
Research Center, NTTI. It's a collaboration

41:27.811 --> 41:33.878
between A&M and UT Austin. And there are others. 
There's a space grant consortium.

41:44.091 --> 41:49.117
There's always a certain amount of ego that gets 
into those things, that gets in the way. Let me ask

41:49.157 --> 41:50.739
this. How have the regents reacted to this 
collaboration? Very positive. I guess

41:59.013 --> 42:12.187
I don't want to keep you too much longer, Dr. 
Richardson. What have been your greatest, you

42:12.267 --> 42:18.514
might say, difficulties, problems, or issues as 
chancellor of the system? And where do you see the

42:19.034 --> 42:23.299
system

42:19.034 --> 42:23.299
heading?

42:27.937 --> 42:38.194
Of course, a uniform difficult challenge in these 
times is the financial one. So dealing with the

42:38.214 --> 42:52.999
legislature in particular, the state 
legislature, and trying to be sure that we get our

42:38.214 --> 42:52.999
share of the funding, that is one of the most 
difficult challenges.

43:00.438 --> 43:01.479
What about you? I think in terms of new directions, 
I see my job, a lot of my job is to encourage

43:01.700 --> 43:22.786
collaboration and synergy among these 15 
institutions that we have. So that each president

43:22.846 --> 43:30.175
or CEO has a sense of dual citizenship. One, of 
course, is as the leader in their particular unit,

43:31.859 --> 43:45.497
whether it's Texas A&M University or it's the Ag 
Extension Service, but also to feel a sense of

43:31.859 --> 43:45.497
citizenship in the system as a whole. So that while 
they need to look inward and look to the support of

43:48.160 --> 43:59.875
their units and the growth and development of 
their units, they also have to look upward and

43:48.160 --> 43:59.875
outward with a responsibility to help the system 
as a whole be more and do more than the collection of

44:00.732 --> 44:12.788
the individual parts can. We're in a very enviable 
position in a lot of ways because of the presence of

44:12.808 --> 44:26.527
these statewide research and service agencies in 
engineering and agriculture. They provide, in a

44:26.547 --> 44:30.452
lot of ways, the web or the network that encourages 
institutions to work together.

44:41.364 --> 44:44.448
Yeah, that's in the Extension Experiment Station 
tradition, I guess. Yes. So it's really .

44:48.653 --> 45:00.827
I think that

44:48.653 --> 45:00.827
one issue for the future is the relationship of the 
system to industry.

45:02.697 --> 45:05.880
particularly Texas industry, but not limited to 
that.

45:08.963 --> 45:18.551
In engineering, the way things have developed, 
there are many, many very strong collaborative

45:08.963 --> 45:18.551
relationships now. Programs where there will be a 
large number of small companies that come

45:19.352 --> 45:32.063
together with people from

45:19.352 --> 45:32.063
faculty and students, or major industries, like 
the major oil company. Every major oil company

45:36.098 --> 45:39.761
supports the Offshore Technology Center.

45:43.144 --> 45:50.831
I know I was always struck by the interaction 
between the academia side of things and the NASA

45:43.144 --> 45:50.831
side of things. It was just an open door going back 
and forth. Yeah.

45:57.817 --> 46:01.881
These kinds of relationships don't exist so much, 
though, other areas like some aspects at least of

46:02.063 --> 46:14.594
the marine area and agriculture in particular. 
And so one of my goals and one of the goals that I've

46:14.674 --> 46:30.568
asked Ed Hila to adopt in his new position as the 
leader of agriculture in the system is to begin to

46:14.674 --> 46:30.568
foster and develop similar kind of relationships 
with industries that have an interest in

46:31.763 --> 46:37.689
agriculture and the life sciences. And the first 
example of that is the

46:39.330 --> 47:01.332
Center for Vegetable and Crop Improvement headed 
by Leonard Pike,

46:39.330 --> 47:01.332
which now has an industry consortium that's 
working with which is sort of a vertically

46:39.330 --> 47:01.332
integrated The Saudi each has shippers and 
suppliers and growers and food processors and

47:02.628 --> 47:12.064
what not.
