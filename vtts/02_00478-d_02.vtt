WEBVTT

00:05.718 --> 00:16.248
He

00:05.718 --> 00:16.248
says, just because you're the lowest ranking 
table doesn't mean that you don't have an opinion.

00:16.268 --> 00:16.968
I said, don't you? I have. He says, well, tell us. I 
said, Mr. Secretary, when y'all get through with

00:21.512 --> 00:29.460
that top man, don't send him back to us in Texas. 
Well, that broke up the meeting because McNamara

00:37.156 --> 01:03.568
strong but he wasn't as strong as people thought he 
was if he didn't have both the hand of kennedy and

00:37.156 --> 01:03.568
johnson behind him no secretary of defense is as 
strong as mcnamara appeared to be on the surface

00:37.156 --> 01:03.568
unless full faith and confidence of the boss 
McNamara's a smart individual. Very smart. Very

01:09.078 --> 01:12.080
intelligent. Not a practical guy. Some of the 
people that he picked up to

01:14.923 --> 01:28.415
support him were not particularly, I don't think, 
as bright as they gave him credit for. For example?

01:29.056 --> 01:36.002
Well,

01:29.056 --> 01:36.002
one of the

01:37.383 --> 01:51.076
people that helped dictate what was going on in 
Vietnam,

01:37.383 --> 01:51.076
had a

01:37.383 --> 01:51.076
status room. And there in Washington, D.C., in the 
Pentagon, some of these people would actually go

01:51.096 --> 02:04.048
through exercises of sin. Well, now, what if we 
moved a squad of eight men from here over to here?

02:12.149 --> 02:25.193
Now,

02:12.149 --> 02:25.193
you know, that's like me giving permission for a 
couple of GS-14s to sit and play tic-tac-toos all

02:12.149 --> 02:25.193
day. because nobody in Washington is going to move 
eight men in Vietnam from here to there. But, you

02:31.809 --> 02:34.393
know, this is not an exception. I mean, this is a 
rule that they play such silly games, you know. So,

02:39.880 --> 02:42.143
in other words, they try to control the situation. 
Oh,

02:42.584 --> 02:46.409
yeah. What was the general attitude towards 
Secretary McNamara and the Pentagon? mixed

02:54.400 --> 03:00.566
emotions, naturally there would be. You're 
definitely going to get them in the military

03:00.586 --> 03:20.285
because I personally think, and there's no way of 
knowing, I personally think the military is a

03:00.586 --> 03:20.285
little more inclined

03:00.586 --> 03:20.285
to be a conservative GOP. The officers. I don't 
know about you. And whenever you get a bunch of them

03:25.990 --> 03:41.615
and they're having to work for a democratic 
administration, well, a democratic

03:25.990 --> 03:41.615
administration, you get uneasy feelings and so 
on. Sure, they'll carry out to the best of their

03:41.715 --> 03:46.683
ability and whatever the boss says, that goes. But 
for instance, both McCone and Turner, knew full

03:54.391 --> 03:58.798
well that I was a conservative Republican. They 
were Democrats. And I stayed in that office eight

04:00.120 --> 04:02.464
years. No, five years. One year under the first one 
and four years under the second one. So you never

04:09.314 --> 04:14.342
had any problem as far as political philosophies? 
The idea is to get the job done. That's right.

04:20.712 --> 04:22.575
That would have nothing to do with anybody. under a 
democratic administration.

04:32.486 --> 04:35.951
There was never any pressure on you while you were 
in the military to vote a certain way? No, not at

04:35.971 --> 04:41.099
all.

04:41.119 --> 04:41.560
Okay. So much for McNamara. Now, you said, didn't 
you say yesterday when we were talking that at this

04:44.792 --> 04:54.929
time you met Harold Brown, who became Secretary of 
Defense under Jimmy Carter? Did you say that? No,

04:57.173 --> 05:06.028
see, Harold Brown was the next Secretary of the Air 
Force following Gene Zucker. And that's where I

05:07.088 --> 05:13.476
met and knew Harold Brown pretty much on an 
intimate situation at that time. Because it was

05:15.038 --> 05:29.476
while I was in the Secretary's office that the Air 
Force felt that it needed another base in Vietnam.

05:31.559 --> 05:36.285
And you have to go back and Well, who's in control 
and why and where?

05:45.127 --> 05:55.260
McVie, the top guy in Vietnam, of course, was an 
army troop. The theater that this war was being

05:55.280 --> 06:04.112
fought in belonged to the Navy. whose top 
headquarters was in Hawaii.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.406
The Air Force doesn't need another base. Well, 
first the Air Force had to prove that it needed

06:17.369 --> 06:26.827
another base to put more fighters in the Vietnam.

06:26.847 --> 06:28.851
After that was proved, then

06:33.556 --> 06:43.690
The Air Force had to either get the pressure put on 
to the Navy, who was responsible for all

06:33.556 --> 06:43.690
construction in Vietnam. The Army wasn't 
responsible for construction, but the Navy was.

06:47.155 --> 06:47.615
Okay.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.405
Make the resources available to build the base. 
Here's the money. We don't have the resources.

06:58.090 --> 06:59.732
Still, the... don't need the base because now the 
resources are such that we don't have the

07:01.197 --> 07:09.230
resources.

07:09.250 --> 07:20.789
Of course, the Navy didn't want the base because 
its forte was to put the carriers offshore and fly

07:09.250 --> 07:20.789
the missions from the carriers. If the Air Force 
couldn't get a place to put their fighters, there

07:21.610 --> 07:26.057
was no way they could fly them. Clark was too far, 
too long a leg to fly a mission in on the fighter and

07:26.425 --> 07:32.833
bring it back down. Okay, so the Air Force went back 
now and said, prove to them that they needed a base

07:32.853 --> 07:44.989
in Vietnam. In other words, took it out of the JCCS 
and the services and went to the, at the secretary

07:45.009 --> 07:54.441
level, we've proven that we need the fighters we 
got to have this base but we want permission from

07:54.843 --> 08:23.027
you for the air force to contract for and to execute 
and build the base and the air force will supervise

07:54.843 --> 08:23.027
the construction not touch any of the resources 
that are already in country we'll go in there and

07:54.843 --> 08:23.027
design the base bring the contractor in won't 
bother anybody else logistically and build a base

08:23.446 --> 08:27.472
and then pull it back out. The project was named 
Turnkey. And that was exactly what it was,

08:31.399 --> 08:34.464
Turnkey. No logistics support required from 
anything that was already in country. Well,

08:42.637 --> 08:51.090
McNamara

08:42.637 --> 08:51.090
thought he'd work it back and forth, tore it apart, 
put it back together. finally one day made the

08:51.458 --> 08:56.005
decision to do it. Go ahead. Well, this tore the 
Navy apart because it invaded their area in which

08:57.347 --> 09:09.726
they were responsible for construction. And it 
tore the Army apart because the Army had for years

09:13.852 --> 09:21.804
been trying to limit how much capability the Air 
Force actually developed to do design and

09:13.852 --> 09:21.804
construction.

09:24.409 --> 09:29.436
See, under the Key West Agreement, way back when 
Truman was president, they divided the world. And

09:30.739 --> 09:34.925
we got England, the United Kingdom, the Air Force. 
The rest of the world was divided between the Army

09:34.945 --> 09:38.070
and the Navy. Well, the first exception was we got 
to do our own Air Force Academy.

09:47.723 --> 09:52.309
Then the next exception was we got to do our own 
housing worldwide. And all this time, others were

09:54.111 --> 10:08.409
beginning to see us growing a capability that 
would compete with them and push down their

09:54.111 --> 10:08.409
organization because their organization was 
large enough to do not only their own but ours too,

09:54.111 --> 10:08.409
namely the Corps of Engineers. Right. Right. 
Okay. Anyway, we got permission from McNamara to

10:10.687 --> 10:16.673
do turnkey.

10:16.953 --> 10:19.555
Where is the base supposed to be built? Beg your 
pardon? Where was the base supposed to be located?

10:22.298 --> 10:22.898
Okay. We took representatives from four 
contracting firms to that net.

10:33.007 --> 10:38.652
Colonel by the name of McGarvey from the air staff, 
myself, were the escort officers to take them over

10:39.391 --> 10:40.492
Here are the sites. We showed them two sites. One 
was in Wei. We were there the day that the North

10:46.217 --> 10:53.884
Vietnamese overran the border and started 
pushing people out of Wei. But anyway, that was one

10:53.964 --> 10:57.447
of the sites that had been approved. What year was 
this? And the other was Tui Wah. Well, that would

11:01.651 --> 11:03.392
be... This wasn't during Tet Offensive, was it? 
Yes. It was the start of the Tet. So it was January

11:08.281 --> 11:10.623
31st, 1968. Okay. Good on the date. That's your 
job,

11:14.367 --> 11:19.333
isn't it? 68? Yeah. That was 10. But it seems to me 
that it should be sooner than that. It was earlier

11:25.599 --> 11:27.321
than that. Because the buildup was 65. I know, but 
see, I left. I left. So it couldn't have been Tet. It

11:36.683 --> 11:44.011
would have had to be when the initial build-up, 
which was 1965 in Vietnam.

11:45.833 --> 11:49.517
That would be more logical.

11:49.637 --> 11:53.441
Well, it was in the Johnson administration, sure. 
So it would be in...

11:59.648 --> 12:25.268
667 uh 66. still the secretary of defense he 
resigned in 67 so late 66. okay okay anyway we took

11:59.648 --> 12:25.268
these contractors over and showed them the two 
sites the other site was tuyawa t-u-y-h-o-a and

11:59.648 --> 12:25.268
tuyawa was the one that was ultimately chosen and 
mcgarvey was the air staff project officer, and I

12:25.720 --> 12:34.754
was the secretary project

12:25.720 --> 12:34.754
officer. McGarvey was a full colonel, and I was 
lieutenant colonel.

12:40.603 --> 12:46.111
Following the completion, he made BG, and I made 
full colonel. And

12:46.131 --> 12:53.803
it was a practice that We had a weekly report on 
Secretary Brown's desk Friday night before

12:54.155 --> 13:21.062
leaving the Pentagon that gave him a complete 
rundown of everything that had taken place at that

12:54.155 --> 13:21.062
week, gave him the status of all the construction, 
the yards poured, what percent of completion of

12:54.155 --> 13:21.062
the runway was, a whole nine yards. This was quite 
an exercise because Everything was across the

13:24.378 --> 13:25.860
beach. There was no dock.

13:30.306 --> 13:34.032
It was offloading the ships on the lighters and 
bring the lighters across the beach. And this was

13:34.953 --> 13:35.834
everything. All of the construction material, 
all the fuel, all the food, the whole work,

13:36.695 --> 13:44.406
everything came across the beach. Because again, 
nothing was levied on or taxed anything that was

13:44.426 --> 13:50.595
already there. And to make matters worse,

13:57.436 --> 14:06.488
We were told that we would stay within the dollar 
appropriation that had been granted to build the

13:57.436 --> 14:06.488
base. There was no additional money, and we would 
not go back to Congress and ask for additional

14:06.508 --> 14:13.517
money. So this gave both McGarvey and me no end of 
problems, because whenever there was a cost

14:13.537 --> 14:26.194
overrun on one element, across all these miles, we 
had to work out with those people over there, OK,

14:26.393 --> 14:32.318
What are we going to give up, or what are we going to 
change the quality of to cover that essential? And

14:32.338 --> 14:37.243
back and forth, back and forth, both. One of the 
American firms then took the job? Yes.

14:43.628 --> 14:55.759
Abasco of New York, which is an electric bond and 
share company, was the prime holding company that

14:43.628 --> 14:55.759
took the job. Their forte is really power plants. I 
mean, big, huge power plants. They are one of the

15:01.479 --> 15:06.387
largest outfits in the United States. Why do they 
want an airfield? I don't know. What kind of job do

15:10.093 --> 15:11.655
they do? They're an outstanding job. But they're a 
big subcontractor for paving and the runways and

15:12.857 --> 15:22.472
the roads. underground and utilities and so on, 
with a firm out of Florida that had worked on the

15:22.942 --> 15:32.135
Kennedy Raceways and things like that down there. 
And

15:32.276 --> 15:39.927
it was a real good organization that they put 
together. Did they hire Vietnamese to do the

15:40.367 --> 15:43.552
manual labor? Oh,

15:43.572 --> 15:47.157
yes. Sure, sure. And Stan McGarvey was promoted to 
Colonel. It would be on the site. supervisor, the

15:52.979 --> 16:00.149
Air Force colonel, he too was promoted to general. 
So people were properly rewarded. Again, we held

16:02.312 --> 16:20.556
it within the funds that were available and 
reported back to Congress, reported to the

16:02.312 --> 16:20.556
Department of Defense, and when the contractor 
was through, when everybody retreated right back

16:02.312 --> 16:20.556
over the beaches and came on home, and the birds 
flew in, took over the base, and so on. How long did

16:23.489 --> 16:25.571
it take to build? About 14 months, 16 months. Was it 
effective as far as the area? Oh yes, very

16:34.481 --> 16:36.844
definitely. Because they were flying missions 
off of it before it was completed. It was in a very,

16:41.229 --> 16:52.922
very peculiar location security-wise because 
just 60 miles south of there, there never was

16:41.229 --> 16:52.922
complete clean out of the communists. I mean, they 
were that close all the

16:56.350 --> 17:02.576
time. Whereabouts was it? Well,

17:06.140 --> 17:16.671
it would be north of Cumberland Bay. OK. I know 
where that is. Off Highway 1, huh? Yeah. So it's in

17:23.378 --> 17:26.904
between Hawaii and Cam Ranh Bay.

17:32.252 --> 17:32.353
Yeah. I had an interesting trip to Cam Ranh Bay too. 
Tell me about that. We went into Cam Ranh Bay when

17:36.319 --> 17:49.200
before anything had ever taken place other than 
the fact that

17:36.319 --> 17:49.200
some engineer troops were in there cutting roads 
for the Army Depot portion of Comron. And I was

17:55.734 --> 18:16.285
accompanying my boss, Mr. Turner at the time, and 
the top civilian engineer from the Department of

17:55.734 --> 18:16.285
Defense was a man by the name of Ed Sheridan, and he 
was along in the group and took us in a big fly and had

17:55.734 --> 18:16.285
a makeshift map on the wall. Here are the roads 
we're cutting, and here are the ones we've already

18:18.534 --> 18:23.819
cut. And we had flown out of the Tron

18:23.879 --> 18:38.995
in, what

18:23.879 --> 18:38.995
was the transport called? I don't know. The Army 
transport or something. And they had met at, huh? I

18:44.161 --> 18:44.601
don't know. What a little thing. Oh. From the 
trough down the combine. Because they had no

18:49.802 --> 18:51.524
landing. We just landed on dirt. And they had met us 
out there with jeeps and machine guns mounted all

18:55.029 --> 18:59.496
over the thing. And, you know, they took us in. They 
started briefing. And here's what we're doing.

19:02.701 --> 19:04.443
And we're definitely here. And finally he says, 
are there any questions? Mr. Sheridan from the

19:07.768 --> 19:10.572
Department of Defense says, what's that line? He 
says, well, this is Army and that's Air Force, and

19:11.108 --> 19:20.460
we're told that they're going to build a base over 
here, but we don't know anything about it, and we

19:11.108 --> 19:20.460
kind of doubt that they'll ever materialize. 
Well, actually, as we had flown over, we saw our

19:20.620 --> 19:24.365
contractors. They were already clearing the 
field and clearing the way for the first runway to

19:24.385 --> 19:38.703
go in to Comron Bay, and here this colonel was 
briefing about what was going on on this side of the

19:24.385 --> 19:38.703
line, and there was construction going over on the 
other side of the line. He says... But we don't

19:39.357 --> 19:40.899
think it'll ever come about. Well, the contractor 
from the Navy, I mean, all that was contracted

19:41.099 --> 19:48.670
through the Navy, was in there clearing it. So we 
took off, and we certainly didn't give it a big wave

19:48.690 --> 19:53.837
when I was back. But this was the clearing to put the 
AM2 mat down, which was the runway, I'm going to

19:53.857 --> 20:01.226
say. All in all, I had seven trips to Vietnam and six 
to Thailand during that time. Why in Thailand?

20:13.155 --> 20:15.517
Well, we had a number of bases in Thailand. Yeah.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.322
And you were building on them? Well, we were 
building on them. And then

20:21.383 --> 20:33.295
we were building

20:21.383 --> 20:33.295
a project that had a number of names and nicknames. 
The windmill was one. But it was right up on the

20:37.199 --> 20:40.262
Laos. Thai border, and it was the big intelligence 
consolidation area that they were picking up

20:40.867 --> 20:57.442
things out of Vietnam and so on at that location, 
and then relaying them on back. But it was one of the

20:57.562 --> 21:07.712
largest projects over there, run by the security 
service.

21:07.992 --> 21:10.114
I guess it was under construction for a while.

21:14.920 --> 21:19.044
A year and a half,

21:14.920 --> 21:19.044
I guess. But a lot of the stuff that they dropped 
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail were,

21:19.064 --> 21:41.367
not being one, so I don't know, but some type of 
pickup communication devices and things like

21:19.064 --> 21:41.367
that that they could sense, oh, but sense how much 
tonnage was coming down the trail just by air. But

21:42.157 --> 21:44.399
that was tucked away up in the jungle. But we

21:44.459 --> 21:58.655
had three active bases that fighters

21:44.459 --> 21:58.655
were all over. Thailand also is a wonderful place 
to visit compared to Vietnam. You felt a little bit

22:03.660 --> 22:08.866
more comfortable in Bangkok than you did in 
Vietnam. What were the conditions like in

22:08.886 --> 22:10.948
Vietnam?

22:14.843 --> 22:22.473
Uh, in Vietnam I'd say they were, uh, they varied so 
much, you know. You could,

22:22.493 --> 22:43.180
uh, get one place and have fairly decent quarters 
and vests, and another place,

22:22.493 --> 22:43.180
uh, often wondered whether you were ever going to 
find the luxury of these hanoms, uh, the, uh,

22:48.155 --> 23:04.733
here in the city,

22:48.155 --> 23:04.733
always wondering about security.

23:04.753 --> 23:13.161
I personally stayed out of the more popular 
places, because that's where all the trouble was.

23:13.181 --> 23:16.525
There were other places most of the time for us to 
go, Traveling at the level we were at,

23:18.530 --> 23:30.220
we needed to stay in certain quarters that weren't 
used and were pretty well guarded. We so desired to

23:32.402 --> 23:38.547
have a meal right there at the quarters.

23:38.567 --> 23:47.054
The hours were such that work late and get up early 
and start again. We're not there to to spend a

23:49.512 --> 23:53.977
lifetime with her and get that done and get out of 
there. So you don't fall into the custom way of a

23:53.997 --> 24:08.234
person who is assigned over there lives or plays 
or, quote, enjoys life. What about inter-service

24:08.254 --> 24:10.177
rivalry? We've alluded to some of that. It's been 
eight years in Washington, DC. Did you see a lot of

24:15.243 --> 24:18.827
inter-service rivalry?

24:23.043 --> 24:25.386
I've got to address that in two parts.

24:27.809 --> 24:41.685
The time that I was in the Secretary of the Air Force 
office and back and forth and working with the Navy

24:27.809 --> 24:41.685
and some agencies of the Army for the things that 
had to go on in Vietnam. Yeah.

24:47.492 --> 24:49.995
And yet, at that time, we had a a director of civil 
engineering down in the military, named Bob

24:51.241 --> 25:01.115
Curtin, who was a pretty smart individual. And he 
tried to

25:03.058 --> 25:14.395
eliminate some of this rivalry by establishing 
what he called exchange officers with the other

25:03.058 --> 25:14.395
services. Let's get some of our people working for 
you and some of yours working for us, and we can get

25:14.555 --> 25:20.944
rid of this bickering and so on. That's all well and 
good. But the bickering doesn't really go on on the

25:23.616 --> 25:25.780
work level. Captains and majors and lieutenant 
colonels can work like heck with each other. This

25:31.148 --> 25:31.909
is the job. Get it done. Goddamn colonels and 
generals would like to do the bickering. Hey,

25:37.638 --> 25:39.281
that's our job. Y'all back out of that. What can you 
get put? Oh, four or five weeks. Well, hell, we've

25:43.187 --> 25:45.811
got to have it done tomorrow. It can't happen. It's 
our job. We'll get it done. Their priorities don't

25:49.797 --> 25:52.180
fit their priorities. There's always a reason 
why. But then I jumped all the way over when I went to

25:53.942 --> 26:08.898
the Department of Defense as a general officer and 
was a director in the Department of Defense,

25:53.942 --> 26:08.898
dealing with all four services. And believe it or 
not, I had more problems with my own service than I

26:09.439 --> 26:16.607
did with the Army and the Navy and the Marines. What 
do you mean? coming out of the Department of

26:18.434 --> 26:34.174
Defense and saying, okay, here's a project we want 
to work out, or here's a policy we want to get

26:18.434 --> 26:34.174
established, and I'd have no problem with the Army 
or the Navy or the Marines, but I'd find guys in the

26:18.434 --> 26:34.174
Air Force fighting the hell out of me. You know? How 
can you count for that? You know, the Air Force

26:38.980 --> 26:43.446
likes to step back and look and think and... Some of 
the others go, okay, if the higher echelon wants it

26:44.033 --> 26:49.618
done this way, this is the way we'll do it. A little 
bit different look at discipline, I guess you

26:50.579 --> 26:55.663
could call it. So you think that the Air Force is not 
as disciplined now or more thoughtful? More

27:00.528 --> 27:01.849
thoughtful. I gave a hell of a lot of thought in 
operation and maintenance of facilities. Now,

27:06.433 --> 27:14.040
see, that was the forte that I was in, not combat or 
not— personnel policy, but in the operation and

27:14.375 --> 27:22.966
maintenance of facilities.

27:22.986 --> 27:30.074
At that time, I was director of facility 
maintenance, and this is what we would be talking

27:22.986 --> 27:30.074
about. Facilities being housing, the whole work. 
But the Air Force had set itself up and had

27:33.038 --> 27:43.791
established the credentials of, boy, we are the 
experts in operation and maintenance. Even

27:44.682 --> 27:51.789
though the Army's been doing it and the Navy's been 
doing it years longer than we have, we're the

27:44.682 --> 27:51.789
experts. And had spent a lot of money to get their 
people pretty well trained. Because having

27:58.656 --> 28:13.170
responsibility for design and construction in so 
small part of the world, their major effort was put

27:58.656 --> 28:13.170
in to operation and maintenance of the soldiers. 
And therefore, they quickly claimed to be the

28:17.691 --> 28:39.183
experts, whereas the other engineering services 
for Army, Navy, and Marines, the Army and the Navy,

28:17.691 --> 28:39.183
they had to spread themselves over design, 
construction, operation, and maintenance, and

28:17.691 --> 28:39.183
try to be experts in all of it. The Air Force did have

28:43.238 --> 28:46.302
I think probably a little bit higher degree of 
expertise. But again, just the cooperation is

28:46.322 --> 28:52.170
what I was thinking at this level. I had more, I had 
bigger problems with my own service than I did with

28:52.731 --> 28:58.299
the others. And this was later on, but you had asked 
about the service rivalry, and that was back in the

28:58.319 --> 29:05.989
early days.

29:15.200 --> 29:35.063
There are a couple of things that were, let's see, 
on the good news side, I call that bad news side,

29:15.200 --> 29:35.063
that I was involved in while in the Air Force 
Secretary's office.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.688
The Air Force Museum is located at 
Wright-Patterson Airport Station, Ohio. You can

29:46.870 --> 29:51.775
go to many air bases and you'll see gathering of old 
airplanes. The real museum is at

29:52.375 --> 29:57.720
Wright-Patterson.

29:58.321 --> 30:03.806
It is not a public finance facility or 
installation. It was privately endowed. It was

30:07.010 --> 30:10.553
built by subscriptions, by donations, by every 
way imaginable. Tax money was not used to build it.

30:19.562 --> 30:32.424
But at the same time, since it was built on an Air 
Force installation, the Secretary chose to have a

30:19.562 --> 30:32.424
real tight control over what type of facility was 
built and so on. Well, the minute the Secretary did

30:32.444 --> 30:34.347
that, then Mr. Turner, it's your job. You carry it 
out. Mr. Turner, come in here. Let's talk about the

30:40.910 --> 30:42.172
museum. So I ended up being initially the recorder 
on the Air Force Museum board. And we went through a

30:53.327 --> 31:02.359
couple of years of fighting out what type of 
facility would be built.

31:05.123 --> 31:15.134
of the Air Force Logistics Command,

31:05.123 --> 31:15.134
a man by the name of Merrill. And Merrill

31:15.154 --> 31:24.665
listened to everything that went back and forth. 
And he and Luke Turner were real good friends. Both

31:26.988 --> 31:30.171
of them had come up in the controller business. And 
they were real good friends. And it had been

31:32.094 --> 31:35.097
proposed initially by the board to go along with 
the design of an architect engineer firm in

31:36.022 --> 31:44.753
Hartford, Connecticut. And this design, we felt, 
that is the board, as well as the recorder, was

31:44.773 --> 32:05.758
going to end up being a

31:44.773 --> 32:05.758
monument to the capability of the architect 
engineer rather than a museum for the Air Force. It

32:11.442 --> 32:17.713
was going to be something that people would just 
look at and forget what was on the inside. And

32:17.733 --> 32:24.625
something that we could never reach in dollar 
payments. The amount of money that we had

32:24.925 --> 32:33.997
subscribed and collected was up in the $4 million, 
$5 million, and $6 million. But this thing was up in

32:34.017 --> 32:38.022
the $18 million, $20 million, and $25 million. We 
were talking about some dollars back there. So

32:39.985 --> 32:50.158
General Merrill,

32:39.985 --> 32:50.158
who's a four-star, asked Turner to have me meet him 
in Hartford. We spent the whole day up there

32:50.178 --> 32:53.262
listening to the architects and engineers. Then 
we went out to the airport, left them alone and went

32:54.912 --> 32:58.135
out to the airport. And he had his plane away from 
taking back to Ohio, and I had a commercial to go

32:58.155 --> 33:02.319
back to Washington. And we sat down for an hour. And 
he says, what do you recommend? I said, General, I

33:08.965 --> 33:12.928
hate to tell you this, because this is probably not 
what you want to hear. But I said, I think we ought to

33:14.770 --> 33:17.472
scrub it and start over. He said, those are my 
sentiments also. He said, as long as you and I never

33:21.696 --> 33:24.058
change, He took off, popped, and we started all 
over again. We scrubbed that architect. We

33:31.879 --> 33:32.680
started again. We've got something back that was 
within reach. We've got a beautiful museum up

33:37.305 --> 33:39.066
there now. Thousands of people daily come into 
that thing. I think we've got one I've ever heard

33:43.371 --> 33:50.799
the airport has ever flown that's on static 
display and all types of everything. It's a

33:50.959 --> 33:53.742
beautiful museum. Why in Ohio instead of out at the 
Academy? Well, because Wright-Patterson is the

33:58.216 --> 34:16.493
headquarters of the Air Force Logistics Command 
and two of the divisions of the Aeronautics of Air

33:58.216 --> 34:16.493
Force Systems Command. Systems Command does the 
research and development. Log Command does the

34:21.835 --> 34:25.679
supply and the modifications once they're into 
the inventory. So that is really the center of

34:25.699 --> 34:36.891
where all of the research development is done and 
where all of the maintenance and modifications

34:25.699 --> 34:36.891
are directed from. The two divisions of the Air 
Force Systems Command are the technology, which

34:36.911 --> 34:47.101
is foreign technology, and one of the research 
divisions. So it is a better place, really, than

34:47.121 --> 34:50.965
the Air Force Museum. Really, I guess, pulls more 
people than something way out in Colorado. You can

34:57.584 --> 35:03.789
keep getting repeats out there, but in Ohio, you 
get different people all the time. I don't know why

35:03.809 --> 35:05.551
they come through there in the wintertime. I hate 
it in the wintertime. But anyway, that board then

35:06.472 --> 35:19.264
grew to the Air Force Academy Expansion Board. The 
job was over for the museum. From then on, it was

35:22.670 --> 35:24.092
execution. That was up to the people at Wright and 
Pack. Oh, we kept an eye on it. Then we went from

35:28.959 --> 35:34.025
there to the Air Force Academy expansion. That's 
when Congress

35:34.206 --> 35:45.180
permitted the Air Force Academy to go from 2,500 
students to 4,417. When it was first formed, it was

35:46.062 --> 35:49.386
smaller than And then they enlarged it, the 
authorization. And with that, we had to build more

35:55.374 --> 36:02.402
dorm space, more classroom space, add on to the 
dining hall. We had all of this to do. And this all

36:05.166 --> 36:13.595
came right on the tail of building one of the 
largest field houses that you and I will ever have

36:05.166 --> 36:13.595
seen. It is a fabulous field house.

36:19.252 --> 36:21.115
We had the field house under control. Again, 
Turner put it under control. You do not have a

36:25.841 --> 36:29.967
nickel over the appropriation. I will not go back 
to Congress and ask for one nickel more than has

36:30.948 --> 36:35.755
been appropriated. He told this to General 
Curtin, and he said, my dog catcher is hugged. He's

36:42.124 --> 36:43.386
going to watch every dollar. got to establish a 
direct communication between HUB and the man in

36:44.885 --> 36:52.334
Colorado, and it's not going to get one nickel 
more. He didn't get one nickel more. Again, it

36:54.697 --> 36:56.619
would swap out and everything else. But 
beautiful. Then we went on in to overseeing the

36:57.760 --> 37:03.027
expansion of the academy. But like I said earlier, 
the Air Force did have special permission to do its

37:03.047 --> 37:14.841
own design and construction work for its academy 
without having to go to the Corps of Engineers or so

37:03.047 --> 37:14.841
on. The, this board had, I've used the name 
Sheridan, the man from the Department of Defense

37:16.120 --> 37:24.993
was on it. The superintendent of the Air Force 
Academy, of course, was on the board. Those are the

37:30.982 --> 37:41.638
two that really

37:30.982 --> 37:41.638
played a role in what I was doing and then later on. 
What was the end result? The end result was on time

37:44.858 --> 37:53.269
as the wing built up and grunted people in. Oh, 
certainly we had problems. Glass in that part of

37:57.354 --> 38:00.998
the country is a hard thing to control. Different 
coefficient of expansions of glass and metal trim

38:02.500 --> 38:12.553
caused all types of popping of glass, sand 
blowing. And that part of the country etched glass

38:13.124 --> 38:18.810
that we didn't foresee.

38:21.032 --> 38:28.660
So we had to go back and raise the standards and the 
hardness of glass and so on. But it's

38:28.961 --> 38:33.065
a beautiful facility. A&M will even envy some of 
the things that they've done. They have, for

38:37.690 --> 38:39.672
instance, A&M doesn't really need it because it 
gets cold at College Station. I know that. But it

38:44.158 --> 38:46.140
doesn't get cold like it does out there. But when 
the cadets march into the dining hall at the Air

38:46.180 --> 38:57.770
Force Academy, they go through a screen that they 
never see. And it's a double screen of warm air

38:59.772 --> 39:09.861
blowing both from the floor and the ceiling to keep 
the cold air from coming in with the cadets. so that

39:11.309 --> 39:17.897
the inside of the dining hall never feels the draft 
when those doors open and cadets marching in. And

39:19.479 --> 39:25.586
they just march through these two screens, and the 
temperature inside never changes. Can you

39:28.269 --> 39:31.153
imagine that on the dining hall of the college 
station? Oh, man. Fabulous. Fantastic. So those

39:35.170 --> 39:46.085
are the two good things that you feel that happened 
from 1963 to 1968 when you were working in the

39:35.170 --> 39:46.085
Secretary's office. On the outside, again, I was 
doing Boy Scout work. I don't know how much you know

39:50.591 --> 39:55.978
about the Boy Scouts, but I was given a silver 
beaver at that time by the Boy Scouts. So I did have

39:55.998 --> 39:58.641
time to do some other things. Good. tremendous i 
was uh wondering then how exactly how your

39:59.673 --> 40:24.972
functions and duties changed when you went from 
master planning to the secretary of the army's

39:59.673 --> 40:24.972
office secretary airport yeah i'm sorry of course 
well of course i took the master planning response

39:59.673 --> 40:24.972
i mean the access road responsibility with me so uh 
in master planning that was that was worrying

40:25.222 --> 40:28.466
about, oh, a fourth of my time. And as I got to the 
secretary's office, I guess it dropped to about,

40:28.707 --> 40:35.236
oh, maybe a fifth or sixth of my time. And then these 
other things picked up. The museum, the academy,

40:38.139 --> 40:47.592
the base in Vietnam, and different problems. I 
initially went to the secretary's office to be

40:47.712 --> 40:54.081
just a straight exec to the civilians. And that's 
what I was the first year under Alan McComb. But

40:58.511 --> 41:03.637
when Turner came in, he said, man, you ain't about 
to be an executive. He said, I'm giving you a job, a

41:03.657 --> 41:10.185
specific thing that you're responsible for. And 
what did you think of that? I thought that was

41:12.627 --> 41:14.269
great. I said, what are we going to do about the 
executive? He said, I've already got another

41:17.633 --> 41:20.036
military authorization. And you tell me which one 
of those colonels down there you want. And we just

41:24.048 --> 41:27.452
brought in another lieutenant colonel, and he 
became the exec. He kept tabs on everything that

41:27.812 --> 41:30.155
was going on. Well, why did they switch you to 
specific jobs instead of keep you as the exec?

41:34.860 --> 41:42.249
Because he wanted me doing functional work, doing 
things that he was responsible for. Whereas the

41:42.369 --> 41:49.397
exec, it's an important role, but then he keeps his 
finger on everything that's going on in the

41:42.369 --> 41:49.397
office. He's really kind of responsible for 
nothing except what the boss specifically says.

41:54.742 --> 41:56.344
You do this and come back to me. Oh, I'd rather have 
the functional role. Because in the other four

42:00.208 --> 42:05.234
years, I did engineering and construction. And I 
did operation and maintenance. And got into the

42:07.136 --> 42:12.021
problem and had things at that level. Now, I wanted 
to ask you about Vietnam since. You had been there a

42:18.605 --> 42:24.094
number of times, although you weren't in the 
combat in Vietnam itself. I'm sure that you must

42:24.655 --> 42:26.598
have some ideas on this. Why did we lose the war in 
Vietnam?

42:34.010 --> 42:36.153
I wouldn't even tell you. Okay. Tell me about 
Harold Brown. You started talking about him, but

42:39.779 --> 42:44.326
you said you got to know him very well, but you never 
described him. What type of person is he?

42:48.912 --> 43:18.548
Well, Heron Brown, when he was Secretary of the Air 
Force, was

42:48.912 --> 43:18.548
probably

42:48.912 --> 43:18.548
the most

42:48.912 --> 43:18.548
contemporary

42:48.912 --> 43:18.548
thinker

42:48.912 --> 43:18.548
with real strong technological ability that that 
level is probably never seen. You've got to

43:25.805 --> 43:31.013
remember that that's one level below the 
Secretary of Defense. And there's nothing else

43:31.694 --> 43:34.137
like it in our government. Because as the 
Secretary of the Air Force, even though he was

43:34.297 --> 43:45.413
under a cabinet man, he probably had more power 
than some of the people that were on the cabinet.

43:46.777 --> 43:55.065
well-educated individual that was

43:46.777 --> 43:55.065
always ahead in thinking. You could talk to a man or 
brief him, and you knew damn good and well that he

43:56.146 --> 44:14.264
was five or ten minutes ahead of you, but at the same 
time, the guy that had the patience to hear you

43:56.146 --> 44:14.264
through. I never saw the man get impatient Man

44:16.510 --> 44:24.341
with a good sense of humor.

44:24.361 --> 44:29.329
Now, I'm saying this when he was Secretary of the 
Air Force. I'd still not know him as anytime in his

44:29.629 --> 44:33.675
role in the Department of Defense. But you thought 
he was a good leader at the Air Force? Oh, yes. Very

44:36.619 --> 44:38.322
good. Gene Zuckert is what the Air Force needed. 
Gene was a lawyer.

44:45.232 --> 44:45.893
Harold Brown a technical man. But Gene was what we 
needed when the Air Force was down and building up

44:49.084 --> 44:54.070
fast. Brown was what we needed when, OK, let's 
start thinking about the future and research and

44:54.611 --> 45:03.383
development. Let's start putting some chips in 
the long range and see if there are not systems that

45:03.403 --> 45:14.698
are lying out there waiting to be discovered and so 
on. And this is what we were talking about the other

45:16.636 --> 45:20.062
day. We need both the practitioner and we need that 
thinker in that reserve. Okay, let's move to the

45:27.675 --> 45:30.219
United Kingdom. Your next job with the Third Air 
Force as the Deputy Chief of Staff from 1968 to

45:30.720 --> 45:35.568
1970. Okay, let me tell you a little bit about how I 
got there. Go ahead.

45:44.969 --> 46:00.776
During

45:44.969 --> 46:00.776
the last year that I worked in Secretary's office, 
I had made up my mind to retire. And I had put in my

46:03.280 --> 46:08.749
retirement papers and

46:12.374 --> 46:20.003
was even taking a physical, a retirement 
physical, at the airport hospital at Andrews.

46:20.023 --> 46:21.105
Why'd you decide to retire? Well, I was a reserve 
officer at that time. And

46:26.131 --> 46:39.707
it's a strange thing in personnel work, but I was on 
active duty as a lieutenant colonel, but I was a

46:26.131 --> 46:39.707
permanent colonel in the reserve. And I couldn't 
see getting anywhere getting promoted and I had 27

46:42.327 --> 47:06.495
years in which gave me close to the maximum for 
retirement and I would have retired as a

46:42.327 --> 47:06.495
pro-Colonel Payne rather than a Lieutenant 
Colonel even though My active duty grade was only

47:06.880 --> 47:09.009
lieutenant colonel. As a reserve officer, I was a 
full colonel, and that's what I was retired of.
