four, one, two, three, four, one, two. One, two,

00:09.782 --> 00:11.745
three, four, one, two, three.

00:15.411 --> 00:16.553
This is August 25. We're in the Blocker Building, 
and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with

00:18.035 --> 00:28.772
Carl Schaefer, professor of agricultural 
economics and a friend for almost 40 years. For the

00:30.085 --> 00:47.321
sake of someone, Carl, who might not know you when 
they listen to this tape or read the transcript a

00:30.085 --> 00:47.321
half century from now, describe your family 
background, growing up, where you went to school,

00:30.085 --> 00:47.321
college, graduate school, and so forth. No 
worries. Describe Carl Schaefer before getting

00:47.801 --> 00:51.705
to College Station. From birth? Yes. I was born in 
Oklahoma City. 1933. the depth of the Depression.

01:01.430 --> 01:02.751
Moved to Alva, Oklahoma in 1934. My father's 
health was such that he couldn't continue to work

01:03.352 --> 01:14.162
in the hotel, so he came to Alva, Oklahoma, the home 
of my grandparents, my grandfather having come

01:03.352 --> 01:14.162
here from Germany in, we think, 1877. Alva's a 
wheat farming community in northwest Oklahoma.

01:20.729 --> 01:28.797
My father moved into the back of my grandfather's 
harness shop with a radio shop, which I always

01:20.729 --> 01:28.797
thought was an interesting juxtaposition. 
Buggies and cornice in the front and radios in the

01:29.300 --> 01:32.565
back. I grew up in Alva, Oklahoma. Should I mention 
the gold bugs and the green bugs? Where are our

01:39.054 --> 01:39.956
mascots? Went to Alva High School and I went to 
Oklahoma A&M College. It was then in Stillwater,

01:47.146 --> 01:53.215
Oklahoma, which became in 1957 Oklahoma State 
University as we know it. I got a BS degree, and

01:53.684 --> 02:09.084
actually I played basketball there, but I had to 
take something, so I took agricultural economics

01:53.684 --> 02:09.084
for BS, and I got a master's of agricultural 
economics while I was waiting around for my wife to

01:53.684 --> 02:09.084
graduate, and although I was interested in the 
field. We left there in 57, went into the Army. The

02:13.310 --> 02:20.299
Army had a surplus of officers, so I only did six 
months active duty for training at Fort Monmouth,

02:13.310 --> 02:20.299
New Jersey. And then from there we went to graduate 
school at Pennsylvania State University. From

02:24.758 --> 02:38.830
fall of 1957 when Sputnik went up and a lot of money 
was then thrown at higher education

02:24.758 --> 02:38.830
institutions, agriculture being among the 
recipients. And as the Penn State left there in

02:39.150 --> 02:50.640
1961, I actually came to my first job and only job 
academically was at Texas A&M University from

02:39.150 --> 02:50.640
January of 62. through September of 1998. We 
arrived here on one of the coldest days of the year,

02:54.517 --> 02:59.364
January 62. The place was frozen. That's a very 
quick summary of where we've been. How did you and

03:05.133 --> 03:07.998
A&M link up? What were they looking for, and how did 
they find you, and how did you find them? Well, I had

03:13.992 --> 03:18.879
met, people didn't visit, in those days you didn't 
go somewhere, at least I didn't go somewhere for an

03:13.992 --> 03:18.879
interview. You sort of did things over the phone, 
by word of mouth, by somebody else that was known. I

03:24.408 --> 03:32.841
had actually interviewed with Texas A&M at the 
summer meetings, which are the big meetings of the

03:24.408 --> 03:32.841
American Agricultural Economic Association in 
1960. Ty Timm and John McNeely were there, Bob

03:34.343 --> 03:42.936
Branson, and I interviewed with them, but I didn't 
have the job, I think, probably until we got to be

03:34.343 --> 03:42.936
1961. Then a friend of mine who'd been at Penn 
State, C. Harold Brown, and his wife Sally were

03:43.827 --> 03:59.268
here in sociology because the department was the 
Department of Agricultural Economics and

03:43.827 --> 03:59.268
Sociology, not rural sociology, but sociology. 
And so Hal seemed to like it here, so we thought it

03:59.289 --> 04:06.118
sounded good, and we were also provincial because 
it was close to home. Being from Oklahoma, we

04:06.218 --> 04:09.603
wanted to get somewhere back in the territory. We 
had two children, and of course we had two sets of

04:09.643 --> 04:13.328
grandparents in Oklahoma, But I had never heard of 
Texas A&M until I was a senior in high school and

04:14.017 --> 04:19.264
went to a football game at Oklahoma University. 
They were playing Texas A&M, and there was all

04:20.145 --> 04:27.335
these people standing over in the Texas A&M 
section, which I thought was really strange. They

04:27.355 --> 04:33.824
were all in uniform, and that's really the first 
time that I'd ever heard of Texas A&M, as I said,

04:27.355 --> 04:33.824
being provincial. But we got here through the fact 
that it was located where it was and through Hal and

04:33.844 --> 04:42.336
Sally Brown, and I think at that time A&M was 
breaking out of its somewhat narrow orientation

04:42.957 --> 04:46.202
in terms of whom they were hiring. When I got here, 
there were, gosh, almost everybody in our

04:46.783 --> 04:51.389
department had their degrees from Texas A&M. And I 
think I was the third, maybe the third or fourth guy

04:52.250 --> 05:00.002
in the department who didn't have their degree, 
their terminal degree, as we say, from Texas A&M.

05:00.022 --> 05:02.005
Did you interview over the phone? Was there a kind 
of an interview, or back in the summer? Yeah, there

05:06.231 --> 05:10.517
was a, well, at Colorado State, which is where the 
meetings were in the 60s, I had talked to Branson

05:10.902 --> 05:15.489
and Tim and Neely, but I did not come down here. No, 
I'd never been here. But did they interview you?

05:18.153 --> 05:19.715
Yes, yes, we talked, we visited. I mean, it wasn't 
really a very formal interview, but we did visit.

05:22.259 --> 05:27.366
As you recall, what were their key concerns about 
whomever they might be hiring? Oh, gosh, that's

05:27.386 --> 05:30.110
been a while, Haskell. Branson was really looking 
for somebody to work with him in what would become

05:31.092 --> 05:37.281
the Market Research Center. And I was in 
marketing. I had been in milk marketing. I'd done

05:40.880 --> 05:44.966
my work in the Amish country up there on bulk milk 
handling. But it was close enough to marketing

05:45.747 --> 05:50.154
that they were interested in someone in 
marketing. And that's about as far as we got, I

05:50.174 --> 05:52.838
think. Who else they talked about? The people at 
Oklahoma State they may have interviewed. I don't

05:56.244 --> 05:57.425
know. And of course, the head at Penn State. But I 
can't remember other than just wanting to get

06:00.310 --> 06:05.698
somebody in marketing and somebody with a degree 
other than. Do you remember what kind of paperwork

06:06.539 --> 06:11.886
you submitted to them as a part of the review 
process? Well, it wasn't very extensive. I'm sure

06:14.449 --> 06:15.811
there was probably a letter. I remember what I 
filled out when I got here, some of that, but the job

06:15.831 --> 06:23.460
application wasn't very complicated. As far as 
you know, did they make some phone calls to some of

06:24.061 --> 06:29.428
your former teachers? You know, I had to provide 
references, and I assume they did, but I really

06:30.870 --> 06:35.095
don't know. part of my career weakness was that I 
didn't ever seek much advice from people or

06:35.412 --> 06:43.763
discuss with them as much as I should with them, I 
think, but I imagine they did. I know when we got

06:44.343 --> 06:46.366
here, we had to sign a loyalty oath. I remember 
that. It was a page that must have been hundreds of

06:47.828 --> 06:50.812
organizations. I remember that piece of paper 
worked. But other than that, it seemed pretty

06:51.973 --> 06:54.777
standard stuff. When you came, how long did you 
assume you might be here? Well, you know, in that

07:00.163 --> 07:03.748
day, in the 60s, the early 60s, the mark of a good 
academic was that you moved a lot. I mean, people

07:08.049 --> 07:09.131
were coming. You remember Russ Thompson was here. 
And of course, Hal left six months after we got

07:11.615 --> 07:15.521
here, Hal Brown did. And so you moved a lot if you 
were that active. I've always been sort of a static

07:18.747 --> 07:22.212
equilibrium person. I'm not that interested in 
moving, but more in doing the career where I was. So

07:27.060 --> 07:28.302
I don't know, I guess you thought If I ever thought 
about it, maybe, you know, five or ten years, first

07:29.210 --> 07:36.501
job, not necessarily stay here, but Texas A&M 
began to change so much. Did you have any school

07:37.542 --> 07:42.570
that hidden back in your mind was your ultimate, 
ultimate goal? No, I interviewed at Ohio State,

07:44.072 --> 07:47.176
but that was an extension position. I wasn't 
interested in that. But as far as going back to

07:48.768 --> 07:55.557
Oklahoma State, no, that wasn't particularly an 
objective. I think I was happy, as happy at A&M as I

07:55.577 --> 07:59.982
probably would have been most places. Maybe 
somebody thinks about, no, I don't think I want to

08:00.162 --> 08:04.067
go to Harvard. Did any of your Penn State faculty or 
student colleagues tell you anything about A&M?

08:12.718 --> 08:14.320
What was their impression of A&M? Okay, we had a 
faculty member at Penn State, Larry Foraker,

08:14.519 --> 08:20.591
Professor Foraker in economics. His father had 
been on the faculty in engineering at Texas A&M,

08:20.611 --> 08:28.085
and I think his family was still here when I got 
here. Foraker went on to be dean of the business

08:28.826 --> 08:36.561
school at Harvard, which was interesting because 
he graduated a Ph.D. from Colorado. But he was a

08:37.250 --> 08:39.652
very good, I guess a very good administrator. He 
was a good academician. And I talked to Dr. Foraker

08:42.655 --> 08:46.359
about coming to A&M. And as I recall, he said, well, 
it's a good place to start. That was about the only

08:49.922 --> 08:51.344
advice he had. And I always saw him a few times 
afterward. But other than that, I don't think most

08:56.088 --> 09:02.635
of the guys at Penn State knew much about Texas A&M. 
Did anybody tell you anything about College

09:02.655 --> 09:06.078
Station O'Brien before you got here? Not a bit. Not 
a bit. Didn't know what we were getting into. As I

09:10.008 --> 09:10.970
said, we drove in. It was freezing, freezing. 
Describe what you and your wife and children

09:14.494 --> 09:20.122
brought with you. How voluminous were your 
belongings? We had a two-wheel U-Haul trailer,

09:23.547 --> 09:35.843
orange and white, I remember, which we packed in 
Pennsylvania, and one of the pieces was a dry sink,

09:23.547 --> 09:35.843
an antique dry sink from... Pennsylvania, which 
if we'd known better, we'd have thrown all our

09:36.515 --> 09:42.922
furniture away, loaded with antiques and brought 
them down here because they were more valuable in

09:36.515 --> 09:42.922
Texas. But we got all of our stuff in a two-wheel 
U-Haul trailer, which we reloaded in Oklahoma

09:43.403 --> 09:54.696
City because we could save money by switching 
trailers in Oklahoma City to come to Texas. But

09:55.137 --> 09:55.737
that was it. We slid all the way from Penn State, 
from State College down through Well, all the way

10:00.933 --> 10:02.976
down here, it was icy and snowy. I remember that. 
But it was a risky trip. But we didn't take much to

10:05.039 --> 10:06.902
have our possessions. And describe what it was 
like to find a place to live. Well, now we had, I keep

10:11.128 --> 10:16.797
forgetting people, but we knew, we also knew some 
guys who were at Penn State. They had a big

10:17.498 --> 10:19.841
meteorology Air Force program. And one of them 
was, I can't think of Andy's last name, but Andy had

10:21.063 --> 10:25.810
been come to Texas A&M. He's from Tennessee. He was 
on the faculty here in mechanical engineering. I

10:30.642 --> 10:31.082
forgot. I just remembered this just now. And Andy 
and Wanda had found us a house over on Nagel, $90 a

10:33.064 --> 10:38.849
month. And it was a two-bedroom, a very nice house, 
not far from the campus. So we had already picked

10:42.773 --> 10:45.535
out for us a house. We were lucky. We were lucky 
these kids had got it for us. And, of course, Hal and

10:48.057 --> 10:50.520
Sally were here, too. But you hadn't seen it yet. 
No, no, I hadn't seen it. No, no. No, we hadn't seen

10:53.242 --> 10:54.183
the house. We just pulled in sight unseen. 
Describe what it was like to become a part of the

10:57.076 --> 11:04.789
neighborhood and a part of the community for you 
and Peggy and the children. Well, our idea in

11:05.951 --> 11:13.624
becoming a part of the neighborhood was mostly to 
join a church, to find a church. And we visited

11:14.406 --> 11:15.267
around. We had been Southern Baptists all our 
lives. Then we got to Pennsylvania and we became

11:18.633 --> 11:21.598
American Baptists. And then we came back down 
here, we visited around, and finally found the,

11:22.928 --> 11:28.675
located at First Baptist Church College Station. 
That really became our locus of our community. The

11:33.660 --> 11:45.034
neighborhood, Zerl Carpenter, who became 
director of extension, lived about four blocks

11:33.660 --> 11:45.034
down from me when he first moved in from Wisconsin 
as an assistant professor in animal science. I'm

11:46.295 --> 11:48.478
trying to remember who else lived on Nagel Street. 
A few other prominent people lived there. My next

11:51.127 --> 11:56.432
door neighbor was a milkman, Albert Gruss, and 
electrical engineering was next door. But we only

11:57.073 --> 12:01.857
lived there, we were there about four years, I 
guess, before we moved over to Gilchrist. So we did

12:02.858 --> 12:08.443
meet some of the neighbors, but mostly our social 
stuff, you know, was the department and the

12:02.858 --> 12:08.443
church. That's where we were from. All right, 
describe... I've got a frog in my throat. Okay,

12:15.590 --> 12:20.695
describe your first days, weeks, months in the 
department. getting received, an office, and

12:20.810 --> 12:27.804
getting acquainted, and undertaking your first 
work? Okay, we're in the agriculture building,

12:29.086 --> 12:37.783
renamed the history building, right in front of 
what used to be, well, no, no, it wasn't in front of

12:29.086 --> 12:37.783
then. It was between the systems building and the 
library, which was only a single building,

12:37.803 --> 12:42.733
Cushing. So we're running between the Texas 
engineering station and the system building. But

12:47.661 --> 12:56.230
the ag building consisted of agriculture 
economics, poultry science, and weed science,

12:47.661 --> 12:56.230
whatever that is, was in the basement. My office 
was with two other faculty in room 300 of the

12:57.812 --> 13:05.000
agriculture building, top floor. There were 
three of us in there shortly, and I got another

13:05.661 --> 13:09.004
office. But I remember moving up there in January, 
and it was cold. I didn't teach the first semester

13:14.303 --> 13:19.528
because that was springtime, just showed up. I 
missed the first, I missed the Agricultural

13:20.188 --> 13:26.173
Primer Station Conference by a few days. I know Ty 
wasn't happy about that. He thought I should be

13:27.795 --> 13:29.836
there for that, which I didn't know was happening. 
But I haven't met him, and I forget the other person

13:30.897 --> 13:35.441
that was up there in that room. So I started 
teaching, I think, the next fall. In agriculture,

13:38.164 --> 13:40.245
we didn't teach like you do in history. We don't 
teach as many courses. We're about half research,

13:41.446 --> 13:43.348
half teaching. And then the summer came. But I got 
oriented. I went around, met the dean. I didn't

13:48.670 --> 13:53.177
meet President Rutter until he had come over to Dr. 
Tim's office later. I met him, but I didn't meet. I

13:55.700 --> 13:57.042
showed you around the dean. I met the director of 
Experiment Station. Try and think who that... Oh,

13:59.025 --> 14:00.568
gosh. He was a guy from Penn State. Lewis? Yeah, 
R.D. Lewis, yeah. Great old gentleman. What was

14:06.997 --> 14:10.262
your initial impression of the dean and of Dr. 
Lewis? Well, the dean was... from Louisiana. Gus

14:13.867 --> 14:14.528
Watkins? No, no. Patterson? Patterson, yeah. 
R.E. Patterson. And he had played basketball.

14:20.496 --> 14:21.737
Since I had played basketball. We hit it off very 
well. But, you know, what did I know? I was like a

14:24.621 --> 14:26.243
fish in... He doesn't know he's wet. I didn't know 
what administrators were supposed to be like. I

14:30.669 --> 14:33.313
had only known professors by and large. Everybody 
seemed very pleasant. It was a very cordial place.

14:36.056 --> 14:36.918
We felt welcome. I know Ty and Valerie and... Who 
was the guy in the English department? Johnny... A

14:42.813 --> 14:48.181
friend of Ty's, first month we were here, they took 
us to Houston and took us shopping. John Paul

14:48.201 --> 14:49.563
Abbott? No, it wasn't John. This guy was Johnny. He 
was from East Texas. His wife was a Cajun. I can't

14:55.291 --> 14:56.292
think of his last name. He was in the English 
department, not John Paul Abbott. Anyhow, these

14:58.556 --> 15:02.882
people all seemed, you know, like good folks to me. 
I think one thing that impressed me was everybody

15:03.082 --> 15:04.965
had a title. I wasn't used to leaders of this and 
directors of that. Everybody I knew was just

15:07.729 --> 15:10.052
professor or doctor. So I had to get used to the 
nomenclature. But I thought we were well

15:12.397 --> 15:14.600
received. What about Rudder when you first met? 
What was your impression of him? Very impressive.

15:21.870 --> 15:24.374
It wasn't standoffish so much as austere. I held 
him in great awe. This was a man, and one didn't mess

15:26.597 --> 15:29.941
with him. I didn't see a lot of his humor, but you 
paid attention when he spoke. So he came to Dr.

15:36.290 --> 15:38.333
Tim's office. In fact, as I recall, we were there He 
said he didn't want to, and I think this

15:40.627 --> 15:48.460
conversation took place when we were in Dr. Tim's 
office about not integrating the school with

15:49.553 --> 15:57.002
females and the Corps, making the Corps 
voluntary, but then he was saying that he was going

15:49.553 --> 15:57.002
to have to do this. He was going to have to do this or 
the place was going to survive. My memory says that

16:00.145 --> 16:02.528
I heard that in Dr. Tim's office. I may be wrong, but 
I know he met in his office with President Rutter.

16:07.073 --> 16:16.624
Was any mention made in that conversation about 
his academic background and or his link to

16:07.073 --> 16:16.624
agriculture, his interest in agriculture? Well, 
it seemed, as I recall, he was interested in

16:17.414 --> 16:22.140
agriculture, but there was no mention of his 
academic background. In fact, I didn't even know

16:22.301 --> 16:28.409
that he didn't have an extensive academic 
background for some time. Now, did anybody in the

16:28.449 --> 16:39.504
department or outside of the department give you, 
as a new faculty member, advice on how to behave,

16:28.449 --> 16:39.504
what to wear, what to do or not do? Oh, yeah, very 
clear on what to wear. You always wore a tie, and if

16:40.946 --> 16:47.134
you were going to teach, of course, you wore a coat 
and tie. And even in the summertime, we would wear

16:47.485 --> 16:54.056
ties, short-sleeved shirts, no question about 
that, no shorts. I mean, nobody caught, you know,

16:54.076 --> 17:00.306
you're always dressed with a tie and appropriate 
attire, long pants. And in the summer, the first

17:01.008 --> 17:08.480
year I got here was the last year that the 
agricultural building was not air-conditioned.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.505
Now, some of the guys had their own window units. 
They belonged to them. They were their own. And at

17:13.929 --> 17:14.370
that I think 63 then, they air conditioned the 
building. But that summer of 62, and they showed me

17:17.770 --> 17:22.380
why. People brought towels to the office, and they 
would lay the towel on their desk. And you would

17:26.737 --> 17:31.246
write so that it would absorb the perspiration as 
you sat there in that office. Now, you had a window,

17:31.647 --> 17:37.178
but still it was very hot if you didn't have an air 
conditioner. And President Rutter, I think the

17:37.198 --> 17:42.127
rumor was, thought when they air conditioned the 
building, he was going to get these units. He

17:42.428 --> 17:44.632
didn't realize that they belonged to the faculty. 
So they all disappeared. and went back home or

17:46.548 --> 17:48.551
someplace. In terms of appearance, what about 
haircuts, beards, and mustaches? No, no beards.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.843
Maybe there had been some mustaches, but no 
beards. Everybody had short hair, at least that I

17:57.624 --> 18:01.991
knew. Of course, agriculture was a little 
different, but even the rest of the colleges. No,

18:07.339 --> 18:08.420
it was a very straight laced. Did Dr. Tim or anybody 
else give you any advice about being a new faculty

18:08.461 --> 18:14.850
member and what to do to succeed? You know, that's a 
good question. I think you sort of knew what you...

18:17.374 --> 18:24.381
McNeely probably did more of that, John McNeely, 
than Dr. Tim. And at that time, publication was

18:25.041 --> 18:31.787
desired, but it wasn't the ultimate good in life. 
It was sort of a mixture of things, research and

18:32.989 --> 18:39.094
teaching in our case, some extension work, some 
service, they call it service work. But they

18:39.114 --> 18:45.360
weren't heavy-handed with advice because you 
were given a little more... I don't know if you call

18:45.661 --> 18:50.849
it freedom, but there wasn't as much, the pressure 
wasn't as great. It was more academic in the old

18:50.869 --> 18:57.338
sense where you were more your own boss and did your 
own thing as long as you kept busy. I probably

18:58.380 --> 18:59.802
didn't seek enough advice. Was anything ever said 
about alcohol, tobacco, or anything like that? I

19:08.094 --> 19:10.318
don't remember the alcohol thing, but tobacco. 
Houston Smith, who was sort of an assistant, he was

19:10.698 --> 19:13.963
really a cowboy. who Dr. Tim had brought in to do 
survey work and research for research data,

19:14.467 --> 19:25.537
Houston Smith would stand at the door of room 300 
when it became a meeting room with a box of cigars.

19:26.298 --> 19:30.502
And everybody almost would take a cigar when we 
went in for a faculty meeting. And I mean, when the

19:30.562 --> 19:34.325
faculty meeting got started, it was blue. You 
could hardly see anybody else in the room because

19:34.666 --> 19:38.750
everybody was smoking something. But I remember 
that box of King Edward cigars he'd stand there

19:39.050 --> 19:42.533
with at the door. And everybody, it was, you know, 
it would be a nightmare in today's world. Who paid

19:47.140 --> 19:48.321
for them? Who bought the cigars? I have no idea. 
Maybe Ty. I'm sure Houston didn't. Now, there's a

19:53.848 --> 19:57.372
good kind of thing to show how times have changed. 
Oh, yeah. About how often did the department meet?

19:59.594 --> 20:02.377
Oh, gosh, I think we had a weekly staff conference. 
We had too many. I believe we met once a week. And how

20:05.461 --> 20:06.562
many people would be there? Everybody. How many 
was that? Oh. The room full must have been 30, 45

20:10.778 --> 20:13.761
people. What kind of issues did you all discuss? 
Well, a lot of things that probably didn't need

20:16.743 --> 20:25.711
discussing, but everything from, I suppose, the 
plumbing, I'm not sure what all. Not many big

20:25.832 --> 20:30.816
decisions were discussed because Ty pretty much 
took care of those. I think he'd bring things up

20:30.836 --> 20:39.604
that he was going to discuss, but I don't remember 
that it seemed like to us younger faculty members

20:30.836 --> 20:39.604
that we spent too much time in meetings. So that's a 
good question. What did we discuss? They weren't

20:43.690 --> 20:44.411
seminars. They were faculty meetings, mostly 
where you got information you were given. And he

20:49.256 --> 20:51.800
was the department head, not the chairman. For 
sure. He was a benevolent department head, yes.

20:56.345 --> 21:03.634
Can you give some examples of early, in the early 
years you were here, of the kinds of decisions that

20:56.345 --> 21:03.634
he made? Well, I think all, as far as I can remember 
now, unlike the way it is now, then promotions and

21:04.795 --> 21:18.535
things like that were decided by probably Ty and 
John McNeely and Pat Wooten. Pat Wooten, the

21:18.596 --> 21:29.672
department was set up so that Ty was the head, John 
McNeely ran the research side, Pat Wooten did the

21:18.596 --> 21:29.672
teaching side, which included graduate and 
undergraduate at that time. Later, they brought

21:32.361 --> 21:37.126
in J.C. Grady as the undergraduate guy, and Pat was 
the graduate advisor. And I'm thinking, I may be

21:37.827 --> 21:49.560
wrong on this, it seems like Reagan Brown sort of 
handled the extension part, but I could be wrong on

21:37.827 --> 21:49.560
that. But Ty had it pretty well organized, where he 
was the leader, and these other divisions were

21:57.007 --> 22:00.633
headed up by other people. And as far as you knew, 
he's the one that had made the decision to hire you.

22:06.823 --> 22:09.507
Well, I'm sure he consulted with McNeely. I think 
he was really close to McNeely and Pat Wooten. And

22:14.135 --> 22:17.781
I'm sure the three of them would have to, 
particularly he and McNeely would agree on it. As

22:18.402 --> 22:21.647
far as you could compare At about the time you came 
here, compare agricultural economics at Penn

22:22.100 --> 22:31.756
State and at Texas A&M. Well, at that time, Penn 
State would have been considerably, if you look at

22:31.776 --> 22:47.702
publications and quote, learned journals, 
unquote, and the reputation of their staff, Penn

22:31.776 --> 22:47.702
State would have been certainly above Texas A&M. 
But that's what Texas A&M is working on, bringing

22:48.188 --> 22:52.795
in people like Russell Thompson. And I can 
remember the guy who became quickly head of, or

22:53.616 --> 23:00.526
worked at a station down here, Jim. My memory's 
failing me. But I mean, they had good economists

23:03.951 --> 23:06.655
here, like C.A. Bonin and people of that caliber. 
But these guys, they didn't have PhDs. But they did

23:12.269 --> 23:14.412
good, solid work. Bonnen's son later became a 
fellow in the association, Jim Bonnen, up at

23:15.173 --> 23:19.779
Michigan State. I'm sure I'm overlooking some 
people, but Penn State would have definitely been

23:21.881 --> 23:28.049
a higher rank than Texas A&M. Tim was known, but if 
you looked at the journal articles at that time,

23:28.550 --> 23:33.156
you might find one by Ty. They brought in Ken 
Tiefertiller, too, from Oklahoma. A&M had come

23:36.119 --> 23:36.960
down here. He was one of the other additions. But it 
was definitely... And southern departments were

23:41.429 --> 23:44.031
kind of looked down on in those days. But Penn State 
would definitely have been above it in rank, and

23:45.132 --> 23:49.176
A&M would have been at that, I think. All right. Did 
you get the impression early that A&M was planning

23:49.537 --> 23:57.084
on moving up in quality and reputation? Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, that was pretty clear by the people that, the

23:58.145 --> 24:08.615
three people that were, three or four that were 
here before I got here in terms of spreading out the

23:58.145 --> 24:08.615
geographical distribution of degrees and that 
sort of thing. Yeah, I don't think there was any

24:08.635 --> 24:09.756
question. Even in early 62, they were working 
toward that. Now, your beginning salary was how

24:13.225 --> 24:15.188
much? Seventy-five hundred dollars. Twelve 
months? Twelve months. Twelve months. And what

24:19.674 --> 24:25.802
was your original assignment, teaching, 
research, and so forth, what were you to do? I'm

24:26.263 --> 24:35.455
guessing, and I may be wrong, but it was no more than 
twenty to twenty-five percent teaching and the

24:26.263 --> 24:35.455
rest of it was research. And you have to remember 
that in those days Agriculture got lots of money

24:38.180 --> 24:44.838
from the federal government through the Hatch 
Act, the marketing side. I forget all the history

24:45.820 --> 24:49.911
on that, but we had no problem no problem getting 
research money. It was by formula, and it was

24:52.511 --> 25:02.186
allocated out to the states, and I could tell you 
some stories that I've heard from history

24:52.511 --> 25:02.186
professors on what they had versus what we had, but 
I won't go into that. But so we had lots of research

25:02.827 --> 25:12.481
money, relatively speaking, and we didn't teach, 
nobody taught much in the way, maybe one course a

25:02.827 --> 25:12.481
year, maybe two courses a year max. That's the way 
it was. All right, and you were assigned to do what

25:14.685 --> 25:18.210
kind of research? Marketing. I did marketing 
research. When I first got here, I know we did some

25:20.885 --> 25:23.969
carrot marketing. And the Valley was having 
trouble with their carrot marketing order and

25:24.710 --> 25:32.179
getting low prices and lots of volatility and risk 
going on down there. Got into grapefruit

25:33.141 --> 25:35.303
marketing, same sort of thing. Got into some egg 
marketing in East Texas and so on. Marketing

25:41.491 --> 25:44.195
projects, how do we improve the prices? How do we 
improve the marketing system? Much of it was

25:46.490 --> 25:48.212
descriptive research. It was not journal based 
necessarily. Who did you work with from the campus

25:50.796 --> 25:58.526
to get started in those assignments and what kind 
of contacts did you make out in the field? Well we

25:59.588 --> 26:09.561
worked with, I worked mostly with Bob Branson at 
that time and making these contacts and other

25:59.588 --> 26:09.561
people in marketing Some with Swede Sorenson. 
I've forgotten Swede's first name because he was

26:13.657 --> 26:15.919
always Swede Sorenson. He was into vegetables. 
But in the Valley, we made contacts. Most

26:20.265 --> 26:27.974
commodities have an association with Texas 
Grapefruit Producers, Texas Vegetable Growers

26:20.265 --> 26:27.974
Associations, and so on. So we made contacts with 
them. I remember when I first got here, first year

26:29.937 --> 26:37.245
or two, got a fantastic grant from the Texas 
Vegetable Growers. I think it was like $2,000.

26:39.730 --> 26:42.814
This was big bucks in those days. So once we got out 
of association, we would work with them. But most

26:46.217 --> 26:48.841
of our work, we didn't get grants. They didn't 
support that because you had money from the

26:48.861 --> 26:53.226
federal government to do these studies. And what 
about the county, the local county agents or

26:53.246 --> 26:58.772
regional extension officers? Did you work with 
them much in those early years? The research side,

27:02.196 --> 27:06.161
we would make contact with them, let them know we 
were there. But generally, you operated at least I

27:08.755 --> 27:15.603
did, in the marketing side, since it wasn't 
production economics, I was doing marketing, you

27:08.755 --> 27:15.603
operated somewhat independently of that. They 
wanted to know if you were around, if you were in

27:15.623 --> 27:18.006
their territory. Can you give some anecdotes that 
you remember about what it was like for an

27:18.386 --> 27:26.535
Oklahoman to get acquainted with some Texans out 
in the field? How did a farmer respond to somebody

27:27.997 --> 27:32.562
that was there to help him? Yeah, right. The 
farmers were okay. It was the next step up, the

27:36.909 --> 27:47.662
packers, the shippers, the guys who sometimes 
when you were studying them, and Oklahoma is not

27:36.909 --> 27:47.662
that much different from Texas. I mean, Texas may 
not believe that, but it's not an altogether

27:47.682 --> 27:51.666
foreign country. It was the proprietors, and I 
almost got in some trouble down in the valley

27:52.888 --> 28:03.180
because we were investigating the carrot thing, 
and it was our hypothesis and I think a fact that the

27:52.888 --> 28:03.180
shippers took advantage of the growers. And 
looking into that, I was almost carried out of

28:03.329 --> 28:09.876
office one time bodily because that was none of our 
damn business. And leave him alone, don't ever

28:10.536 --> 28:11.978
come back. So the producers were sympathetic to 
what we were trying to do because mainly it was

28:12.739 --> 28:18.705
producer-based marketing. But many times the 
middlemen, the next step up, the buyer, the

28:18.725 --> 28:27.514
packer, the shipper, were not sympathetic to what 
you were doing unless they had initiated the

28:18.725 --> 28:27.514
project. I never had trouble with the Texas 
farmers, identifying with them, because I had

28:28.186 --> 28:33.692
come from a farming community. I wasn't a farm boy, 
but I worked on a farm, wheat harvest and so on, when

28:34.092 --> 28:38.016
I was a kid. So I felt comfortable with them. Was 
this your first encounter with Hispanic farmers,

28:40.679 --> 28:46.124
workers? Well, we didn't, I hadn't, I can't think 
of a thing where I, any occasions where I

28:46.484 --> 28:54.092
encountered Hispanics. The people I worked with 
in the valley, lower Grand Valley, were all

28:55.387 --> 29:00.495
Anglos. And the workers or any farmers were 
Anglos. The shippers were Anglos. The workers, of

29:06.223 --> 29:11.090
course, out there were a lot of Hispanics, but I had 
no direct contact with them. So there was not that,

29:12.532 --> 29:20.184
I didn't feel that influence, although I was right 
here in the middle of it. All right. In those early

29:20.484 --> 29:23.809
years, about how much time were you on the road? How 
often were you out? Well, we'd go out fairly often

29:25.614 --> 29:30.500
to gather data, whether it was with the Valley, of 
course. That was always an overnight trip. And you

29:32.703 --> 29:36.568
usually drove down there, and you'd stay, you 
know, two or three nights maybe. And then if you

29:37.329 --> 29:43.536
went to Dallas to get data, you'd probably stay 
overnight with some... Well, you always stayed in

29:37.329 --> 29:43.536
a hotel or motel. But I was on the road. It's not like 
being in the extension service in Texas. Now,

29:47.822 --> 29:49.304
there you spend your life on the road. Even today, 
it's... They spent a lot of time out, but I wasn't

29:51.211 --> 30:01.886
gone that much getting data, and we got primary 
data a lot of the time for research purposes, but I

29:51.211 --> 30:01.886
wasn't gone that much on the road. And in what 
vehicle or vehicles did you go? Well, you always

30:04.329 --> 30:09.156
used a departmental or a motor pool vehicle. You 
could check them out. You didn't take your own car,

30:10.418 --> 30:15.625
rarely did you, and you just checked it out of the 
motor pool. Did you ever have any unusual problems

30:16.466 --> 30:21.133
with one of those vehicles? Not that I remember. I 
know we didn't take them anywhere that we weren't

30:26.033 --> 30:28.376
supposed to. No, but I mean, one never broke down 
halfway between nowhere? No, I never had any

30:32.582 --> 30:34.584
trouble with them. We did have a departmental 
vehicle. It was a Chevrolet, whatever that thing

30:36.227 --> 30:41.313
was that had the motor in the back. And we used to 
have trouble with that. But no, I don't remember

30:44.177 --> 30:47.862
being stranded with those vehicles. They were in 
fairly good shape. And then later on, you begin to

30:49.844 --> 30:51.947
take your own vehicle. And you just got paid 
mileage. But most of us in those days only had one

30:54.556 --> 30:56.798
car. And so if you took your car, your wife had no 
car. So you didn't do that. Do you remember what the

31:02.146 --> 31:05.049
per diem was in those days? No, I remember motels, 
though, were like, you know, less than $20. And I

31:10.697 --> 31:15.523
really don't remember what the per diem was. It 
wasn't much. It didn't have to be much. Did anybody

31:18.427 --> 31:21.411
give you any private advice of what?
