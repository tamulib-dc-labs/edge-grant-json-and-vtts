WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:08.289
on the faculty would be more, might make more of an impression possibly.

00:09.070 --> 00:11.273
And he just waffled.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.575
I don't really know if he ever did or not.

00:14.256 --> 00:18.121
There was no change in the young man's attire, so.

00:19.422 --> 00:24.548
Share some anecdotes that you remember about teaching Aggie students.

00:24.568 --> 00:25.189
Teaching Aggie?

00:25.690 --> 00:28.313
Some funny, some serious.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.097
Well,

00:32.903 --> 00:37.991
I can kind of continue this pattern of being female in the school.

00:38.952 --> 00:48.567
I had a student, a Hispanic student, who was a terrible, terrible student.

00:49.188 --> 00:52.213
He was lazy, he didn't work, he didn't do anything, he made Fs.

00:53.414 --> 00:58.422
And one day he came, but he was always very, very polite,

00:59.195 --> 01:01.519
and just did everything right, never complained.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.405
One day he came to me and said, I want to say goodbye to you.

01:05.786 --> 01:06.728
And I said, what do you mean?

01:06.808 --> 01:09.252
In the middle of the semester, I got kicked out of school.

01:10.514 --> 01:10.814
Why?

01:12.638 --> 01:15.001
He wouldn't salute a female officer.

01:17.265 --> 01:22.955
And he and I had a long talk, and I said, why didn't you want to salute the female officer?

01:23.375 --> 01:24.898
He said, women have no business

01:25.570 --> 01:32.437
in leadership roles, and she's dumb, and I don't know why not.

01:32.818 --> 01:37.643
And I said, look, you've always been very polite to me.

01:38.764 --> 01:45.611
You seem to have accepted the fact that even though I'm a woman, I'm also a person in authority.

01:46.592 --> 01:49.435
Why can't you do that with this other lady?

01:49.735 --> 01:56.354
And he said, I admire you because you have degrees, you have backgrounds, and you know what you're doing.

01:56.494 --> 02:00.686
She doesn't.

02:00.706 --> 02:04.858
So I tried to tell him that's stupid to get kicked out of school for that.

02:05.632 --> 02:12.499
And I told him, he said he wanted to go in the service eventually, you're going to have to salute a great many women.

02:13.199 --> 02:17.003
That was already maybe the early 80s.

02:18.885 --> 02:20.726
But he did get kicked out of school.

02:20.786 --> 02:25.791
He came back a year or two later and visited with me.

02:26.812 --> 02:30.175
And apparently he made his peace with everybody.

02:30.996 --> 02:35.200
But I thought that was so typically Aggie, so macho.

02:35.180 --> 02:38.744
I won't salute an officer because she's a woman.

02:40.066 --> 02:46.734
As a classroom teacher, what were your rules for their conduct in the classroom?

02:47.335 --> 02:50.699
Did you have any standard guidelines?

02:51.681 --> 02:56.447
I never really published them, you might say.

02:57.648 --> 03:04.697
I expected my students to come to class reasonably well dressed, not their bare feet.

03:05.420 --> 03:11.227
and listening, being quiet and behaving.

03:11.647 --> 03:15.271
Otherwise I really had never had any problem or any big groups.

03:15.351 --> 03:19.396
Occasionally somebody in the back, you know how they do, start talking.

03:20.157 --> 03:26.083
I'd simply stop what I was saying or doing and look at them and everything would be dead quiet.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.246
I never had any problem.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.308
What about if they went to sleep during class?

03:30.889 --> 03:32.170
I let them sleep.

03:34.833 --> 03:40.300
Did they ever attempt any jokes or pranks during class?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.481
No.

03:41.501 --> 03:41.841
Really?

03:41.901 --> 03:43.804
No.

03:43.824 --> 03:54.196
On the whole, I think they were better behaved with me than they might have been with some of the men, because I was such a novelty.

03:56.058 --> 03:59.563
They didn't quite know which way the wind was blowing.

03:59.643 --> 04:01.565
Were they polite?

04:02.526 --> 04:03.287
Tremendously.

04:04.043 --> 04:07.808
I have never had a rude student.

04:07.828 --> 04:09.210
Oh, now that's a good one.

04:09.230 --> 04:10.192
I'm glad you mentioned that.

04:10.212 --> 04:12.335
It was really interesting.

04:12.695 --> 04:14.858
Can you give some examples of their politeness?

04:16.020 --> 04:30.861
Well it was always, you know, yes ma'am, no ma'am, if I was going in or out, open doors and what have you, and if we were talking, they never really, you know,

04:32.225 --> 04:37.293
got to the point where they said something like, you don't know what you're talking about.

04:37.313 --> 04:39.476
It was always very, very polite.

04:40.137 --> 04:45.966
Now, in class, as you began, we had female students.

04:46.747 --> 04:50.333
How did the male and female students relate to each other?

04:50.353 --> 04:53.898
At the very beginning, when I started teaching, I didn't have any females.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.342
My very first classroom,

04:57.149 --> 05:04.079
had, I don't know, I think 27 corps members and three non-corps members.

05:05.581 --> 05:08.165
And those three really stood out.

05:09.947 --> 05:21.303
But again I must say that the corps members all throughout, not just at that time, were definitely the most polite of any of them.

05:22.184 --> 05:26.110
The civilian students were very polite too, but in a more relaxed

05:26.393 --> 05:33.420
way, you know, they didn't really come to attention and say, yes, ma'am.

05:33.861 --> 05:41.369
And then when I got the women, there were several all at once.

05:42.450 --> 05:43.311
I think that helped.

05:44.892 --> 05:47.615
I never said a word about anything.

05:47.655 --> 05:54.342
I just went about my business, talking what I was supposed to do, calling on them.

05:55.334 --> 06:00.621
in elementary language courses, you'd call a lot on your students.

06:00.641 --> 06:02.663
I'd just call on them indiscriminately.

06:02.703 --> 06:05.727
It was no problem whatsoever.

06:06.208 --> 06:13.177
In terms of their capability for the entry courses, how well prepared were they?

06:16.541 --> 06:20.386
Well, with the first-year course, it didn't matter because it started from scratch.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.670
The problem we had for several years

06:24.950 --> 06:35.000
were transfer students who had taken one year with foreign language at Prairie View or at Blinn and made A's.

06:36.902 --> 06:40.166
And here they were making F's.

06:40.186 --> 06:47.193
And I understand that Blinn has really changed its ways completely.

06:47.233 --> 06:48.915
I don't know about Prairie View.

06:49.115 --> 06:54.223
But that, for a while, was an escape for some of the students.

06:54.303 --> 06:57.548
They knew it would be difficult for them to take it somewhere else.

06:58.509 --> 07:02.175
But I even called Austin once.

07:04.799 --> 07:09.486
Whoever our president was at the time told me to try.

07:10.850 --> 07:22.546
and asked if it was true that we had to accept a student, a transfer student, even from our junior college, with his so-called credit.

07:22.988 --> 07:24.994
And they said, yes you do.

07:25.379 --> 07:32.307
And that made for a little bit of unhappiness because I can see the student's part of B very well.

07:32.888 --> 07:44.382
He didn't do anything, made an A. Here's in my class all of a sudden, or somebody else's, my colleagues came to me to complain, and they're failing the course in the second year.

07:45.103 --> 07:47.987
And this problem existed in all of the languages.

07:48.027 --> 07:50.830
Yes.

07:53.257 --> 08:01.908
I think it was pretty much restricted to Spanish because Glen and Prairie View only offered Spanish as a foreign language.

08:03.611 --> 08:08.337
So they may be doing more now but at the time they didn't.

08:08.797 --> 08:14.585
And your grading philosophy, did you grade on the curve?

08:14.705 --> 08:14.905
No.

08:18.029 --> 08:19.251
I don't know how I'd feel today.

08:19.752 --> 08:21.434
I never did grade on the curve.

08:21.454 --> 08:22.335
I never did either.

08:22.417 --> 08:32.687
I had a strict test laid out, so many points for each, and if you missed it, that many points were taken off, and that was it.

08:32.707 --> 08:42.516
And interestingly enough, even though I had some very poor students, it didn't seem to matter.

08:42.596 --> 08:48.542
I mean, I didn't find too many students failing.

08:49.113 --> 08:52.617
on account of too many little F's or something.

08:53.018 --> 08:54.259
It just seemed to work out.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.122
There were good many A's.

08:57.063 --> 08:59.987
It was just a pretty regular bell curve in the end.

09:00.487 --> 09:12.522
Do you remember any rather incredible excuses that students tried to give you for their ... There were some, but I'm not sure I can remember them.

09:15.746 --> 09:17.128
Mainly the funny ones

09:18.560 --> 09:21.746
were for explaining their absence.

09:23.349 --> 09:24.371
This is really true.

09:24.411 --> 09:29.440
One student must have thought I was a little dense.

09:30.382 --> 09:35.151
In one semester he had three grandmothers die on him.

09:36.127 --> 09:41.294
Well he came up and said, I missed your class because I had to go to Henderson, Texas.

09:41.835 --> 09:42.696
My grandmother died.

09:42.997 --> 09:44.999
Fine, I'm sorry to hear it.

09:45.019 --> 09:45.220
Okay.

09:45.580 --> 09:46.742
But he came back twice.

09:47.343 --> 09:50.167
And after that I said, how many grandmothers do you have?

09:50.187 --> 09:51.849
What was his response to that question?

09:53.351 --> 09:54.573
Didn't he blush?

09:54.593 --> 09:56.476
I remember seeing that red face.

09:57.938 --> 10:01.943
I said, well forget it, but don't come with your grandmother again.

10:01.983 --> 10:03.265
Don't bring her up again.

10:03.650 --> 10:11.158
I had a student one year, when he turned in his final exam, he asked if he turned in the ticket to me.

10:12.180 --> 10:13.601
And I said, what kind of a ticket?

10:13.922 --> 10:16.204
And he said, the ticket to take the final exam.

10:16.865 --> 10:17.666
I said, what do you mean?

10:18.286 --> 10:25.995
He said, well, last night in our core dorm, there was a sophomore selling final exam tickets for $5, and I bought mine.

10:28.912 --> 10:33.577
And when I told him what I thought had happened to him, he was ready to get back to the dorm.

10:33.977 --> 10:37.621
That's something, isn't it?

10:37.861 --> 10:43.006
Did you ever have any, no phone calls in the middle of the night?

10:44.207 --> 10:45.088
I had one or two.

10:45.108 --> 10:46.870
Do you remember what?

10:49.052 --> 10:54.497
Well I had one where a student actually threatened me.

10:55.473 --> 10:59.979
Or he said you either give me a passing grade or else.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.584
He didn't say else what, just or else.

11:04.124 --> 11:10.733
And I told David Maxwell about it, David Maxwell told the police chief about it, nothing ever came of it.

11:10.753 --> 11:18.443
One funny thing that happened once, you know we had the language lab, and at the time we still had the reels with

11:19.553 --> 11:26.623
You had to rewind, and we had student workers, quite a lot of student workers in it.

11:27.365 --> 11:34.575
And one night, about one in the morning, I got a phone call from the university police.

11:35.657 --> 11:40.825
Your lab seems to have been broken into, and it looks terrible.

11:41.445 --> 11:42.607
There must be a lot of damage.

11:42.647 --> 11:43.789
Can you come right over?

11:43.829 --> 11:45.712
I said, sure.

11:47.014 --> 11:49.257
They called Dave Maxwell, too.

11:50.080 --> 11:55.026
And sure enough, when I got there, the place looked like, you remember the Addams Family?

11:55.647 --> 12:03.396
They were unwound tape all over, reel after reel.

12:03.436 --> 12:08.202
The whole thing was like, I don't know, a nest of some kind.

12:08.222 --> 12:12.206
And we couldn't imagine what happened.

12:13.528 --> 12:18.754
And the next day, when our lab supervisor showed up,

12:19.223 --> 12:22.608
We talked about it, and I said, is anything missing?

12:23.248 --> 12:25.351
He said, no, I've looked everywhere.

12:25.391 --> 12:28.295
It's just a mess, but there's nothing missing.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.980
He said, also, that tape was to be destroyed.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.043
It was old and used up.

12:35.545 --> 12:47.982
A few hours later, I found out that one of the lab workers had gone in and thought it would be a cute joke to do that.

12:48.265 --> 12:53.390
put that stuff everywhere and then said well whoever comes in here is going to have a good surprise.

12:53.651 --> 12:54.752
And you said she.

12:55.352 --> 12:55.933
It was a she.

12:59.797 --> 13:03.681
So I had a talk with her and she apologized.

13:03.701 --> 13:08.827
She said it just seemed like a harmless, it was a harmless prank.

13:09.588 --> 13:16.635
But I said well you know you just got a whole bunch of people out in the middle of the night, including me.

13:17.527 --> 13:33.645
All right, in relation to the students, do you remember some heartwarming positive events where students came by to thank, came by to... I have had a lot of those, a whole lot of them.

13:34.250 --> 13:46.966
And I've had one or two who came to tell me that maybe they didn't learn much French from me, but I was such a good influence on them, and I helped them with some of their decision-making or something like that.

13:47.266 --> 13:51.211
Because I was always pretty close to students, not those who wanted to be.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.876
If they wanted to come to me and talk, fine, I'll talk.

13:55.216 --> 13:58.360
I think I was more of a counselor to them than the counselors were.

13:59.401 --> 14:01.003
But sometimes that doesn't work.

14:01.023 --> 14:02.485
I had a very upsetting experience.

14:03.038 --> 14:04.620
experience with one woman.

14:06.844 --> 14:23.710
She was an awfully nice person, but she was, I don't know what to call it, super, super, super religious, evangelical, and she never thought she was good enough.

14:24.992 --> 14:31.122
Everything was always beyond her, and

14:32.468 --> 14:34.210
I tried to talk her out of it.

14:34.270 --> 14:47.546
She came to me several times, and apparently, I found out later, she also went to the Episcopal student pastor or whatever, student minister.

14:48.467 --> 14:53.313
She talked to several people, but she did some work for me.

14:54.194 --> 15:01.142
She did an independent study course, and in the course of which we had a

15:01.831 --> 15:11.382
She wanted to sign all her letters, yours truly in Christ, in French, you know.

15:11.422 --> 15:15.967
I'm sorry, you can't do that in the French, there's no way to do it.

15:16.668 --> 15:20.012
And no, to this day, no Frenchman would do that.

15:20.573 --> 15:29.323
That is a way that we have of saying something we want to express in English, but there's no real cultural

15:29.978 --> 15:31.961
equivalent of it.

15:31.981 --> 15:36.027
So she was quite upset about that, but let it go.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.991
But anyway, she killed us after she committed suicide.

15:40.434 --> 15:43.158
While she was a student?

15:43.178 --> 15:43.658
Uh-huh.

15:43.879 --> 15:49.307
That was rough, because I, you know, we always feel I should have done more.

15:49.888 --> 15:51.210
Why didn't I do this or that?

15:51.931 --> 15:55.776
And I was relieved to find out that I wasn't the only one that she had talked to.

15:56.918 --> 15:58.180
But apparently she just

15:59.628 --> 16:06.918
I don't know, had no self-image of herself as a successful person.

16:07.539 --> 16:08.200
She was nice.

16:08.620 --> 16:12.826
She was not terribly gifted or anything, but a good average student.

16:13.427 --> 16:20.737
Now, before you became department head, did you and the other female faculty members ever get together on anything?

16:21.638 --> 16:22.099
Rarely.

16:23.561 --> 16:26.264
Who were the other key?

16:26.345 --> 16:28.167
T'Ulani was one of them.

16:28.535 --> 16:32.660
L-A-A-N-E, her husband's in the chemistry department, Jan Lani.

16:33.761 --> 16:42.873
And Ajit Larebo, whose husband I understand was a pain in the neck in nuclear or something or other.

16:42.893 --> 16:46.077
By the way they're in Brussels, Belgium.

16:46.097 --> 16:47.719
I've visited them a couple of times.

16:48.660 --> 16:52.585
And he finally got a job, and she's got a job.

16:53.306 --> 16:56.770
But they were there.

16:57.205 --> 17:00.130
Any other, in women in any other departments?

17:00.751 --> 17:01.993
No, not very much.

17:02.594 --> 17:08.304
So there wasn't a faculty women's committee or group or anything?

17:08.384 --> 17:10.307
If there was, I never heard of it.

17:11.289 --> 17:15.196
All right, then, and you got promoted on up the line.

17:15.737 --> 17:18.001
When did you work on the doctoral degree?

17:20.004 --> 17:22.268
When did I, I got in 71.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.014
And you became department head?

17:25.034 --> 17:25.595
Two years later.

17:25.715 --> 17:26.356
Two years later.

17:26.976 --> 17:28.698
And what was your thesis?

17:30.559 --> 17:38.807
My thesis was on teachers, well, what did I call it?

17:38.827 --> 17:43.971
Anyway, on teachers' perceptions of various things.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.092
And who was your chairman?

17:47.174 --> 17:47.915
Dr. Varvel.

17:48.355 --> 17:48.715
Walter?

17:48.795 --> 17:49.176
Walter.

17:49.456 --> 17:50.157
Walter Varvel?

17:50.637 --> 17:51.698
Walter, yes.

17:52.522 --> 17:56.730
I had his daughter Mary in class the first summer.

17:56.750 --> 17:57.512
I had his son in class.

17:58.093 --> 18:04.144
She was in my class the first summer I taught in 60, along with a young lady named Ann Rudder.

18:04.805 --> 18:07.771
I had them both in the same class.

18:08.472 --> 18:12.420
Dr. Varber was most unhappy when Ann made a beat.

18:13.835 --> 18:17.540
because he told me she had never made a B at A&M Consolidated.

18:17.961 --> 18:19.983
I said, sir, this is A&M College.

18:20.024 --> 18:21.105
This is not high school.

18:21.566 --> 18:24.430
Then he said, what did the rudder girl make?

18:25.291 --> 18:29.076
And I said, she made a B. He said, oh, okay.

18:29.096 --> 18:33.782
Okay.

18:34.584 --> 18:37.868
What was the process for your becoming department head?

18:38.455 --> 18:39.536
How did that come about?

18:39.556 --> 18:52.970
The process was a little bit unpleasant because there was sort of an organization, you might say, of discontents who wanted Jack out.

18:55.012 --> 18:58.937
And I wasn't terribly involved in it for some reason.

18:58.997 --> 19:01.779
I didn't pay much attention to it.

19:02.720 --> 19:07.045
And for some reason, I think that went to

19:09.067 --> 19:11.971
to the dean's office.

19:11.991 --> 19:16.919
And David really said he told me that later.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.321
He said, I can't work with Jack.

19:18.441 --> 19:20.164
It's just not possible.

19:22.107 --> 19:27.575
And I think we ought to edit that out.

19:28.777 --> 19:37.470
But then he started inquiring and having interviews with some of the faculty.

19:39.847 --> 19:53.544
He invited some possible replacements for Jack from Tulane and a number of other places, and we interviewed them.

19:54.305 --> 20:08.723
Nobody was impressed, and eventually the faculty in the department suggested to David that I would make a good department head, and David went along with the idea.

20:09.580 --> 20:19.718
He said he wasn't sure it was going to fly because of my being a woman, and there hadn't been any other before.

20:20.940 --> 20:24.266
But he said he'd be glad to try, sure enough.

20:25.949 --> 20:29.735
It took a good while to go through, but it worked out that way.

20:31.819 --> 20:34.744
This is what year?

20:35.399 --> 20:43.975
Do you remember hearing anything from Dr. Calhoun's office?

20:46.440 --> 20:51.570
Because I, as dean of faculties, don't remember any negatives at all regarding it.

20:51.590 --> 20:55.517
I didn't hear any, and if Dave did, he didn't tell me.

20:56.476 --> 20:59.279
Were you a full professor at that time?

20:59.439 --> 21:00.540
No, assistant professor.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.222
I remained as an assistant professor.

21:03.242 --> 21:04.924
Then I became an associate professor.

21:05.464 --> 21:11.630
And eventually, full professor only, oh, I think maybe three years, four years before I retired.

21:13.451 --> 21:16.554
And so you were appointed in 74?

21:16.574 --> 21:16.814
73.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.936
73.

21:20.498 --> 21:25.302
Did anyone give you, was there an interview with the dean?

21:27.070 --> 21:30.215
Well, I'd had an interview with the dean.

21:30.596 --> 21:32.379
I mean a long one.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.883
A couple of interviews, really.

21:34.923 --> 21:38.889
Do you remember what he seemed to be most concerned about?

21:38.970 --> 21:39.330
Yes.

21:39.871 --> 21:45.340
He was very much concerned with the quality of the faculty in the department.

21:46.863 --> 21:48.726
I can give you an example.

21:48.886 --> 21:51.390
Jack, God bless him, is dead.

21:52.552 --> 21:57.879
We were looking to fill a position in Spanish, a new position.

21:58.720 --> 22:09.095
And Jack found somebody who had been teaching bilingual education in elementary school for three years.

22:10.617 --> 22:16.585
And they were looking for a job, and Jack thought he'd make a fine addition.

22:17.543 --> 22:22.809
And David just threw that out.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.113
He said, I want some PhDs in there.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.436
I want some people who will do research and publish.

22:30.618 --> 22:33.080
It's got to become a respectable department.

22:34.422 --> 22:44.513
And to the extent to which he could, he was going to support that with the funding.

22:45.337 --> 22:52.211
And during that period then in the early 70s, did you all begin to feel you were treated like other departments?

22:52.892 --> 22:54.656
Oh, we always felt like the stepchild.

22:54.736 --> 22:55.317
Is that right?

22:56.660 --> 22:58.083
But actually we really were.

22:58.544 --> 23:04.476
We taught so many service courses, and the

23:05.384 --> 23:12.531
As I said, our teaching loads were so heavy still, nobody had time to do research or publish anything.

23:13.432 --> 23:16.074
And that needed to be addressed.

23:16.394 --> 23:16.955
And it was.

23:17.976 --> 23:18.416
It was?

23:18.516 --> 23:18.877
It was.

23:19.157 --> 23:19.798
Beginning when?

23:20.518 --> 23:31.729
Beginning I'd say within a year after my becoming department head, because Dave really supported that.

23:32.435 --> 23:34.958
He even increased my budget a couple of times.

23:35.800 --> 23:47.155
I made out the budget, which always took me a good while to do, and sent it up to him, and he came back and said, why don't you ask for a little more here, a little more there?

23:47.535 --> 23:51.040
He said, I think I can get it for you.

23:51.060 --> 23:55.506
Usually I got cut down, so that was a nice breath of fresh air.

23:56.363 --> 23:59.147
then you would give him high marks.

23:59.988 --> 24:08.700
Did you have any interaction with the vice president for academic affairs or hear anything from him or the president?

24:10.002 --> 24:14.989
Occasionally there'd be sort of more sort of informal things.

24:16.811 --> 24:17.292
Nothing

24:19.651 --> 24:21.854
I don't remember anything, really.

24:22.095 --> 24:29.707
Did you have the impression that Dr. Calhoun and Dr. Williams were supportive of the liberal arts?

24:32.211 --> 24:35.736
Well, Dr. Williams would have had to have been, I believe.

24:35.756 --> 24:42.507
By the way, the way he introduced me, we still had the old, what was it called, faculty council.

24:43.608 --> 24:44.730
At my first meeting,

24:45.385 --> 24:46.326
Academic counsel.

24:47.747 --> 24:48.628
Academic counsel.

24:49.509 --> 25:00.740
The first meeting I attended, because I was the only female there, he said he wanted to introduce me and nobody should have ever been in any doubt who I was.

25:03.523 --> 25:14.734
So I think that all the A&M presidents since I started out here

25:15.963 --> 25:23.473
have had a problem with the pressures brought from the various colleges.

25:23.914 --> 25:33.506
And liberal arts always seemed to, I don't know, maybe they didn't lobby hard enough, as hard as engineering or agriculture.

25:34.568 --> 25:42.258
But I think Dave Maxwell probably tried his best to get as much from the college as he could.

25:43.239 --> 25:44.721
But again, a lot of

25:45.123 --> 25:49.488
When that happened, a lot of that went to economics.

25:49.508 --> 25:55.175
Economics is hardly a liberal art, but I'm concerned.

25:56.096 --> 26:03.265
But eventually within I'd say a five year period, by the end of the 70s things were going pretty well.

26:04.527 --> 26:08.211
And we could at least see a better future.

26:08.444 --> 26:12.469
What were your goals as you became a department head, your goals for the department?

26:12.489 --> 26:17.956
My goals for the department were primarily to really have an excellent faculty.

26:18.276 --> 26:25.305
But I was interested in an excellent faculty as teachers, every bit as much as publishing.

26:26.146 --> 26:37.000
Because I felt that basically, I've always been a teacher at heart, and I felt that our first responsibility

26:37.418 --> 26:38.861
must be to the students.

26:39.562 --> 26:50.924
We can't say, well, we won't have any class on Friday, I've got to finish my article on something or other, or come to class unprepared because you're too busy doing your research.

26:51.365 --> 26:55.393
It had to be balanced, and there's a fine line there.

26:55.778 --> 27:08.276
I was mostly interested in really giving the students something that would stay with them for the rest of their lives, and not just a little smattering of this or that and forget it.

27:11.941 --> 27:17.048
Within the department, did you all have a merit salary system in effect at that time?

27:17.389 --> 27:20.613
At that time, yes.

27:21.475 --> 27:23.237
And how did you all judge merit?

27:24.517 --> 27:35.009
Unfortunately, up in the dean's office and higher on up, it was done mainly on the publications record.

27:36.591 --> 27:43.418
As far as I was concerned, we have these teaching questionnaires, whatever.

27:44.239 --> 27:50.526
I took those into consideration personally for about half of the whole thing.

27:51.467 --> 27:53.950
It's all very well to say I have a book coming out

27:54.419 --> 28:02.871
And then have all these students telling me here in writing, this is the worst professor I've ever had.

28:05.175 --> 28:08.900
She or he is never prepared.

28:09.621 --> 28:10.903
There were lots of those.

28:12.205 --> 28:16.832
And there were a lot of conflicts with faculty, between faculty and students.

28:17.953 --> 28:22.620
And so the married deal became a little difficult.

28:23.123 --> 28:24.745
Right now, I'm not going to ask the negative.

28:25.286 --> 28:32.136
During your years as department head, what stars in the department began to shine brightest?

28:33.438 --> 28:34.159
Wolf Kupke.

28:36.342 --> 28:42.011
And some of the Spanish people.

28:43.753 --> 28:46.537
Luis Costa, definitely.

28:48.921 --> 28:52.506
And we had another gentleman named O'Connor, Tom O'Connor.

28:52.587 --> 28:59.458
who did an awful lot for the department, but unfortunately left for a better job.

29:01.802 --> 29:12.138
And there were some people natural leaders as well as teachers and researchers.

29:13.099 --> 29:20.451
And the French section always had the most friction.

29:21.275 --> 29:22.056
Really?

29:22.076 --> 29:24.179
Among each other, among themselves.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.403
It was just personalities?

29:26.924 --> 29:30.369
A French woman and a Frenchman.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.013
Ah.

29:33.033 --> 29:33.514
I hear you.

29:33.874 --> 29:34.295
I hear you.

29:35.096 --> 29:40.064
And then a bunch of others who were uncomfortable, didn't know which way to go.

29:41.326 --> 29:43.809
Which was the most cohesive section?

29:44.410 --> 29:44.831
German.

29:45.231 --> 29:45.612
German.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.365
there will be order?

29:47.565 --> 29:49.212
In part, yes.

29:49.875 --> 29:55.298
And in part because of Wolf Kupke being such a father figure to a lot of them.

29:56.273 --> 29:59.096
to the younger PhDs.

30:00.397 --> 30:07.104
Wolfgang has a very distinguished record of publications and all sorts of other good things he has done.

30:07.865 --> 30:13.851
And he deserves their respect, and he got it.

30:14.992 --> 30:20.457
And when he suggested we do something, they all closed ranks and said fine.

30:21.719 --> 30:25.943
During your years as department head, which section made the most progress?

30:29.112 --> 30:30.714
Probably Spanish.

30:32.936 --> 30:36.639
Because there were more students, more demand.

30:39.062 --> 30:50.853
It's all very well to plan a wonderful program on paper, but if you don't have the students there, the courses will not make, and after a couple of years you lose the courses, you're right back where you started.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.875
With Spanish we didn't have that problem.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.518
And there began to be some majors in the languages?

30:55.598 --> 30:56.378
Yeah.

30:56.619 --> 30:59.001
And what did those students, what career

30:59.335 --> 31:00.397
future did they?

31:01.018 --> 31:02.722
It was an odd mixture.

31:03.223 --> 31:06.970
Very few of them went into anything where the language was essential.

31:08.173 --> 31:11.860
But I remember a few, but not too many.
