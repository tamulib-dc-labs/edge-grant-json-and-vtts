WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:15.409
on all the administrators at whatever level, I'm not going to ask the negative, to which ones would you express the greatest appreciation for their support for the program?

00:16.090 --> 00:24.042
Well, certainly in the, I mean, I had a great admiration for Jack Williams, although I don't think he was directly involved in the day-to-day activities.

00:24.683 --> 00:29.970
I was very impressed with my 30 minutes with him when I initially came down to interview.

00:30.457 --> 00:40.179
Perhaps it was because I was fairly young and impressionable at that time, but nevertheless, I really felt that if he was running the place, it was a safe place to come.

00:40.941 --> 00:48.297
And I figured I was taking quite a gamble because it was the Department of Sociology and Anthropology and might not ever be anything else.

00:48.698 --> 01:01.592
I also liked Dave Maxwell because I found him to be not only an able administrator, but somebody who was very trustworthy.

01:01.672 --> 01:04.295
In other words, what he said, he did what he said.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.577
If he didn't like something, he'd tell you.

01:07.899 --> 01:11.803
But if he told you something, you can count on it and you can take it to the bank, so to speak.

01:12.475 --> 01:19.103
Certainly Chuck McCandless and Danny Parker, who worked in the college, were very helpful in the early days.

01:21.065 --> 01:26.672
In fact, in the early days it was a lot of fun working with Danny because back in those days you did things over the telephone.

01:27.132 --> 01:29.194
And you'd call up Danny and say, Danny, I need this.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.197
And Danny would say, let's go get it, you know.

01:31.217 --> 01:35.682
You didn't have to go through all the paperwork and all this other stuff.

01:36.995 --> 01:39.060
Those were the main people.

01:40.264 --> 01:43.472
Keith Bryan and I really didn't get along too well for a couple of reasons.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.663
I don't know whether this is really important or not,

01:48.250 --> 01:55.959
The only time I ever decided that I wanted to be a dean was after Maxwell left.

01:56.760 --> 02:08.595
And Randy Kirkpatrick and Keith Bryant and I were the three finalists for the position of dean after Maxwell left.

02:09.676 --> 02:13.060
And of the three, they selected Keith Bryant.

02:13.900 --> 02:20.370
Randy Kirkpatrick left and went down to San Antonio where he became president of San Antonio.

02:22.172 --> 02:23.394
Sam Kirkpatrick.

02:23.414 --> 02:23.975
I'm sorry, what?

02:24.235 --> 02:25.257
You said Randy Sam.

02:26.138 --> 02:26.739
Sam Kirkpatrick.

02:26.759 --> 02:27.741
Oh, Sam Kirkpatrick.

02:27.761 --> 02:28.161
You're right.

02:28.301 --> 02:29.323
It was Sam Kirkpatrick.

02:29.383 --> 02:29.924
I got it wrong.

02:29.944 --> 02:30.264
You're right.

02:30.344 --> 02:31.126
Sam Kirkpatrick.

02:31.546 --> 02:33.609
Went down to San Antonio where he eventually became president.

02:34.511 --> 02:37.495
Anyway, Keith Bryant became the next dean.

02:39.331 --> 02:44.357
About the same time I was gaining quite a bit of fame from being on the Today Show.

02:44.377 --> 02:53.449
And to tell the truth were two TV programs I was on where I was talking about my research into kissing.

02:54.631 --> 03:02.841
And of course I was also doing all of this stuff that was reaching the news about the caveman diet and so forth.

03:03.226 --> 03:09.743
Keith Bryant didn't think that this was really exemplatory of faculty members.

03:10.646 --> 03:12.130
Sensationalism is what he called it.

03:12.972 --> 03:17.083
In fact, he one time wrote me a letter in which he basically said, quit doing it.

03:18.312 --> 03:36.735
The other thing that I thought was interesting was, and probably what really endeared me forever with Keith Bryant, was there was a meeting of the Board of Regents in which some of the department heads were invited to, just a small number.

03:36.755 --> 03:38.017
There were two or three from liberal arts.

03:38.077 --> 03:39.679
I happened to be one of them.

03:41.093 --> 03:56.402
I remember I was talking to one of the department heads, I was talking to one of the Board of Regents, and this was right after Keith Bryant had just been appointed dean, so we were

03:56.382 --> 04:26.001
talking and he was asking me what I was doing and I was telling him about my kissing research and he'd heard about it and it was real interesting and Keith was standing very close by and he said well he said I don't know where the dean is but he said I'm sure glad I got to meet the important Dr. Bryant at Texas A&M University and I saw Keith give me a bad look and then the other thing which was really kind of embarrassing was my wife was talking to some of the other women who were the wives of other deans

04:25.981 --> 04:32.632
And they mistakenly took her for Keith's wife and said, oh, well, you have to come over to dinner at our house.

04:32.812 --> 04:33.473
I have to come over here.

04:33.814 --> 04:37.180
And then later, they had to come back and eat crow and say, oh, we're very sorry.

04:37.220 --> 04:38.522
We got the wrong Mrs. Bryant.

04:38.582 --> 04:43.450
Anyway, but Keith, I don't really think

04:43.430 --> 04:50.659
And the other thing was, occasionally he'd get phone calls from the press who would call up.

04:50.699 --> 04:57.868
They'd look in the directory, they'd see a Bryant, and they'd call this guy, and they'd ask him about kissing, and he just got infuriated.

04:58.729 --> 05:06.959
And there were a few other administrators, although I never forget Tom Cherry.

05:06.999 --> 05:07.921
He always thought it was funny.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.445
Tom Cherry was briefly president for a while.

05:12.016 --> 05:12.376
Wasn't he?

05:12.637 --> 05:15.040
No, you're talking about Bob or Tom?

05:15.060 --> 05:19.025
Tom was the business officer and Bob was the secretary to the board.

05:19.766 --> 05:21.769
Who was the president temporarily?

05:24.873 --> 05:25.694
I thought it was Tom.

05:28.478 --> 05:29.839
I remember it was the interim president.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.301
Yeah.

05:31.321 --> 05:33.564
Between, before, before.

05:35.747 --> 05:37.550
Who died not long ago.

05:37.570 --> 05:37.730
Yeah.

05:39.853 --> 05:40.133
Nah.

05:40.754 --> 05:47.504
Anyway, okay, anyway, but it was that cherry, and I remember talking to him one time while he was president.

05:47.744 --> 05:49.106
Well, that would be Bob Cherry.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.251
Bob Cherry, okay, yeah, and he thought it was real funny.

05:52.271 --> 05:53.613
He liked it, you know, he thought.

05:53.933 --> 06:06.792
Now, there was another thing, too, and that is that Mac Prescott, although I always liked... Prescott, go ahead.

06:06.812 --> 06:07.794
Boy, that sounds terrible.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.276
I hope the secretary didn't...

06:10.066 --> 06:11.167
Mac Prescott.

06:11.187 --> 06:11.407
Yes.

06:12.148 --> 06:20.257
I said, although I always liked Mac Prescott, I'll never forget there was one thing that you enjoyed the story.

06:21.018 --> 06:38.757
When I was in biology for 15 years, it was on the dedication, this is when he was dean of science, it was on the dedication of the new biology lecture room, the first really big room on campus that would hold more than 200 students.

06:39.226 --> 06:41.230
This was back in the early 80s somewhere.

06:42.493 --> 06:43.295
Or late 70s.

06:43.335 --> 06:44.136
Probably late 70s.

06:44.698 --> 06:52.474
Anyway, this was a reception that was being held in the room where this new lecture hall was being dedicated.

06:53.617 --> 06:56.282
And he gave this little talk and everything.

06:56.323 --> 06:57.505
Well, anyway...

06:57.788 --> 07:07.466
I was then talking to Eleanor Cox, who was also a graduate of the Department of Botany at the University of Texas at Austin, and the two of us were sitting there talking.

07:08.147 --> 07:16.523
And in that particular classroom, they have white boards instead of black boards, and you write on them with a black felt tip.

07:17.937 --> 07:25.187
And so I was just making a joke, and I said to Eleanor, I said, well, isn't it just like a bunch of Aggies?

07:25.527 --> 07:32.437
I said, everybody else in the world has black boards and use white chalk, and the Aggies have a white board and use black chalk.

07:32.457 --> 07:35.321
And Prescott was standing right next to him, and I didn't know it.

07:35.561 --> 07:36.402
He was right behind me.

07:36.843 --> 07:44.113
He turned around, and he said, in a very stern voice, he said, we don't need comments like that from T-Sips.

07:45.072 --> 07:47.715
And I felt like saying, oh boy, have I cooked my goose now.

07:47.855 --> 07:51.940
Anyway, he never let me live it down.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.382
He continued to remind you?

07:54.683 --> 08:04.694
Yes, continued to remind me throughout my career that I, but, you know, he's a really nice guy and I have nothing against him, but I mean, I just, he bleeds maroon for sure.

08:04.734 --> 08:14.725
Which faculty, for the quality of the current program today, other than you, which faculty deserve most credit for building

08:15.262 --> 08:16.987
the reputation of the department.

08:19.683 --> 08:23.990
Wow, that's a, you know, that's a hard... I'm not going to ask the negative, just which... No, I know, I know.

08:24.010 --> 08:39.095
That's a hard question because Harry Schaefer, who was the first archaeologist we hired, has certainly done a lot at the local level and within the state of Texas to expound on our archaeological proudness.

08:39.315 --> 08:46.146
He's worked with amateurs as well as professionals throughout the state and certainly excavated a lot of sites and so forth.

08:46.126 --> 08:58.602
Probably, well, not counting the nautical people, Mike Waters, who is a geoarchaeologist, is one of the top people in the field of geoarchaeology.

08:58.702 --> 09:07.493
I worry every day that somebody's going to get him away from us because he is not only an excellent researcher and good teacher,

09:07.473 --> 09:19.828
but is a real good asset to our program and really pioneered and has also been the sort of cornerstone of our geoarchaeology program.

09:20.922 --> 09:28.312
He's the one also who excavated and is reporting and writing a book on the prisoner war camp up at Compton, you know.

09:28.332 --> 09:35.983
Anyway, so those two people really, I think more than anything else in our department have really helped their reputation.

09:36.564 --> 09:42.492
Of course, in nautical archaeology, you'd have to point to George Bass, worldwide reputation there.

09:42.961 --> 09:46.787
And I'd say those are the three really key people.

09:47.548 --> 09:50.713
It's not that other people haven't contributed, but.

09:50.734 --> 10:08.462
If the department had the funding for another position today in a new field, and you were the sole authority on selecting that, what other field would you add a person to?

10:10.653 --> 10:12.797
Oh, man, that's a good question.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.985
There's so many different areas that you could go into.

10:17.005 --> 10:26.203
I really think this new technology, the conservation thing, I really think that in the years to come, that's going to really take off.

10:26.744 --> 10:29.189
It's not that I don't, there's nobody else doing it.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.193
I mean, we've already got people in there.

10:32.354 --> 10:43.725
I guess it would have to be, I don't know, I'm really still a marvel at all of the new technology and telecommunications and all of this kind of stuff.

10:44.246 --> 10:47.916
And I know there are anthropologists that are dealing in this kind of stuff.

10:47.896 --> 10:52.282
There are two areas that are really sort of on the forefront.

10:53.424 --> 11:08.686
One is the use of GIS in terms of using GIS in archaeology for determining not only sites but terrain, contours, topography, all this kind of stuff.

11:09.567 --> 11:12.391
That's an area that I think could be exploited.

11:14.894 --> 11:17.498
The other one is in imaging.

11:20.718 --> 11:25.004
We have the technology, it's available, but nobody's really captured it yet.

11:26.907 --> 11:44.532
I foresee someday where you could get on the web and you could go to Texas A&M University and you could punch a button on Musterian Middle Paleolithic lithics, okay?

11:44.512 --> 11:52.223
and then you could see like a hologram, a three-dimensional picture of all of the artifacts that were collected.

11:53.124 --> 12:02.958
So that you could measure them, you could actually do a detailed study of the flaking technology and so forth.

12:03.959 --> 12:14.434
That would not only be true for lithics, but you could do it for pottery, you could do it for buttons, you could do it for coins, you could do it for any kind of artifact whatsoever.

12:14.414 --> 12:39.713
So that someday in the future, a person sitting at his PC, at his desk, would not necessarily have to get up and go to a library and look it up in a book or would have to go get it through interlibrary loan or in some cases would have to go to a museum in England or France to look at the original material because they would have this all available visually.

12:40.570 --> 12:43.954
The technology is there, we just haven't really done it yet.

12:44.294 --> 12:57.590
And of course it would be a tremendous expense and everything, but I know of some anthropologists that are working on the cutting edge of this new technology and trying to develop it for anthropological means.

12:57.630 --> 13:03.777
So either one of those two areas I think would be something.

13:04.195 --> 13:14.851
I'm a great believer in teaching and I mean I've always placed a great emphasis in teaching and I've always tried to hire faculty who were not only good researchers but also were good teachers.

13:15.952 --> 13:23.824
But unfortunately I just don't think that institutions in general and even Texas A&M

13:24.614 --> 13:26.416
pays enough attention to good teaching.

13:26.476 --> 13:26.976
I really don't.

13:27.217 --> 13:27.637
I'm with you.

13:28.518 --> 13:47.397
And, I mean, I hate to say it, but I've seen some excellent teachers sort of fall by the wayside, and I've seen some excellent researchers who were poor teachers and who could care less get all kinds of merit raises and all kinds of kudos.

13:48.058 --> 13:49.159
So, anyway.

13:49.179 --> 13:49.379
All right.

13:49.399 --> 13:52.883
That leads me to almost the next to the last question.

13:53.555 --> 14:07.176
If you had the capability, let's say somebody walks up to you and gives you a million dollar check, there's one requirement, you must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you can decide what use would be made of that money.

14:07.958 --> 14:12.124
What would you... You mean in any area whatsoever?

14:12.164 --> 14:20.457
Anywhere on the... anywhere, anything.

14:23.845 --> 14:25.908
Well, there's so many different places one could put it.

14:25.948 --> 14:37.061
I mean, humanitarianly, you know, you could say, well, you could set up a cancer institute to try to find a cure for cancer or a cure for some fatal disease, or you could put it in the library.

14:38.303 --> 14:42.228
I'd say put it in the library and put it in history.

14:43.009 --> 14:45.752
But what would, do you have any idea what the reason I'm doing?

14:46.897 --> 14:51.912
In other words, what would be your pet desire?

14:55.503 --> 14:56.586
Well, I mean,

14:58.658 --> 15:02.484
My pet, I mean, you have to ask them two different ways.

15:03.265 --> 15:13.501
One is where is the most practical place to put it and where is, you know, the most, well.

15:13.521 --> 15:21.173
But now you're, under this question, you're the emperor and you can decide where it would go and what it would be used for.

15:22.294 --> 15:24.037
Well, if I'm not considering anybody else.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.282
Well, I really,

15:31.160 --> 15:36.625
One of the things that, a million dollars, that's a lot of money.

15:36.645 --> 15:48.016
I don't know if I'd need a whole million dollars, but of course I'm very, and I work with pollen.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.799
We have one of the best collections in the world.

15:52.281 --> 15:58.787
We are on the edge of being able to do what I just described with a pollen collection.

15:59.088 --> 16:17.214
I am in the process of writing an NSF grant to see if I can convince NSF to give us money to do that so that we can put our entire collection in a web type of environment so that people all over the world could benefit from this collection, because most people do not have access to these kinds of facilities.

16:17.294 --> 16:19.577
What kind of money would that cost?

16:19.945 --> 16:21.127
Well, it wouldn't cost a million dollars.

16:21.187 --> 16:21.387
No.

16:22.108 --> 16:24.452
But what are you going to ask for?

16:24.552 --> 16:26.314
A couple hundred thousand or something.

16:26.835 --> 16:33.405
Is it possible that you could do for a half million?

16:33.645 --> 16:35.568
No, you couldn't do all pollen everywhere?

16:37.151 --> 16:38.072
There are...

16:39.217 --> 16:43.502
at least a half a million plants, all of which produce different pollen types.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.464
So it could keep us busy forever.

16:46.586 --> 16:48.067
I mean, you could never get it all.

16:48.388 --> 17:03.385
But the other thing is, and as I said, it's very self-serving, but I would love to see A&M sort of be the focus for the study of pollen of all kinds of things, malicious pollenology, animal pollenology,

17:03.702 --> 17:07.747
Archaeological palynology, geologic palynology, the whole thing.

17:07.927 --> 17:13.154
And it would kind of fit with a school with an agricultural plant.

17:13.394 --> 17:13.654
Sure.

17:13.854 --> 17:15.957
I mean, and geology, too.

17:15.977 --> 17:19.662
I mean, it would have a lot of advantages.

17:20.282 --> 17:30.655
There is no place, there is no university anywhere that has been able or willing to put the resources into building something like that.

17:30.635 --> 17:33.417
one place where it can all be done.

17:33.437 --> 17:35.699
There are some places in Europe and France.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.302
France has put a tremendous amount of money into it.

17:38.322 --> 17:41.184
There are some places that are almost like that in France.

17:41.565 --> 17:58.920
Is there another anthropology program in the United States that is just a little ahead of us in its rate of progress that we could say, here's a school that went from nothing to something that we might use as our model?

18:01.651 --> 18:10.506
I really can't think of another school that has gone from nothing to where we are as fast as we have.

18:11.488 --> 18:15.515
There were so many different factors that all played into our hands at the same time.

18:16.757 --> 18:19.862
I arrived at Texas A&M when there were 13,500 students.

18:21.926 --> 18:25.752
While anthropology was growing, A&M was growing by leaps and bounds.

18:26.272 --> 18:33.081
there were millions of dollars poured into A&M's growth, and some of that was available for anthropology.

18:34.303 --> 18:41.873
If we would have tried to establish this program in a university that was pretty static, we never could have done what we did.

18:42.774 --> 18:46.619
Or if we had tried to do it at A&M before 1960.

18:46.679 --> 18:47.681
Or even now.

18:47.741 --> 18:48.682
Yeah, or even now.

18:48.842 --> 18:50.364
We couldn't do it, you know.

18:50.384 --> 18:55.992
So I don't know of another program anywhere that sort of rose from the ashes so fast.

18:56.984 --> 19:09.070
And Calgary, many years ago, back in the late 60s, the University of Calgary was the first North American university to have a separate Department of Archaeology.

19:09.691 --> 19:12.397
They have a Department of Anthropology and a Department of Archaeology.

19:12.537 --> 19:16.866
And that grew very rapidly over the course of about five to ten years.

19:17.521 --> 19:25.832
But that's a very narrow program and it doesn't have nearly the size of the scope that we have.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.185
As far as another university that's just a little ahead of us,

19:30.667 --> 19:36.396
There are a lot of them that are a little ahead of us, but all of them have been in business for a lot longer than we have.

19:37.197 --> 19:42.064
There are a few that started up more or less when we did, but they're not nearly as far along as we are.

19:42.465 --> 19:44.848
I mean, you know, most of them are still at the BA level.

19:44.868 --> 19:46.110
They don't even have graduate programs.

19:46.992 --> 19:57.147
So, you know, as I said, we came along at the right time, at the right place, with the right kind of circumstances, and also with the right administration.

19:57.211 --> 20:01.438
One of the assets I found at A&M was you can get things done.

20:02.700 --> 20:11.233
I remember from Washington State University and also the University of Texas that administrative hassles were a lot worse than they were at Texas A&M.

20:11.253 --> 20:14.558
So, I mean, we were able to get things done pretty efficiently.

20:15.519 --> 20:16.681
Alright, last question then.

20:17.062 --> 20:21.008
What feelings do you have in your heart about Texas A&M?

20:21.899 --> 20:24.656
Well, you know, my wife and I were discussing that the other day.

20:24.736 --> 20:27.191
She said, well, why don't you retire and let's just go somewhere?

20:27.232 --> 20:28.922
And I said, go where?

20:29.172 --> 20:30.975
I said, why would I want to go anywhere?

20:32.276 --> 20:34.299
I said, we have a beautiful new house that we built.

20:35.741 --> 20:38.686
Our grandchildren live in Houston and in Bryan.

20:40.869 --> 20:42.010
Where is it that you want to go?

20:42.030 --> 20:52.445
I mean, why leave this nice environment and go to Florida or go to California or go to Colorado?

20:52.465 --> 20:56.631
I mean, all of those places have some good aspects, but they also have drawbacks.

20:57.202 --> 21:02.749
And I think I finally convinced her that we will probably spend most of the rest of our days here, you know.

21:03.610 --> 21:11.840
Of course, when I first came over here, I was singing the song of Dumb Aggies, you know, as being a t-sip myself.

21:12.801 --> 21:21.251
And I still don't, I mean, if you walk into my office, you will see a picture of the tower.

21:21.892 --> 21:25.757
It was given to me as a gift on my 50th birthday, and I have it.

21:25.737 --> 21:28.120
So I still respect the University of Texas.

21:28.180 --> 21:29.662
I still enjoy going back over there.

21:29.702 --> 21:31.364
I've been on dissertation committees.

21:31.404 --> 21:36.950
I've been on four dissertation committees at the University of Texas, and I still consider that home when I go over there.

21:37.831 --> 21:43.658
But nevertheless, I was offered a job there once while I was at A&M, and I turned it down, and I would not go back to Austin.

21:44.499 --> 21:47.202
I would not go back there now to work.

21:47.783 --> 21:49.165
I wouldn't want to live in Austin anymore.

21:49.445 --> 21:52.909
Austin is not the same city that it used to be.

21:52.889 --> 21:58.258
A&M has been very good to me and I have absolutely no reason to leave.

21:58.318 --> 22:11.100
So as far as I'm concerned, I will stay here until I retire and then become an emeritus professor and probably do like you do and continue to come up to my office as long as I'm able.

22:11.468 --> 22:13.152
We'll continue to see A&M grow.

22:13.974 --> 22:20.971
My wife graduated from A&M, my daughter graduated from A&M, so we've started a matrilineal line from A&M.

22:21.592 --> 22:25.602
My sons went off to other universities, but anyway.

22:25.622 --> 22:26.203
Let's quit there.
