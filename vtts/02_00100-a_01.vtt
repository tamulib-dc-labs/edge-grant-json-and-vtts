00:02.393 --> 00:10.904
The machine sitting in the beautiful, looks like a 
two-story living room with Dr. Wayne Hall on June

00:02.393 --> 00:10.904
10. And let's see, say something on your mic and 
let's see if it works. Yeah, it's June 10th and

00:17.213 --> 00:21.238
lovely June day outside. The

00:21.298 --> 00:28.468
purpose of these interviews is to try to record for 
posterity and anybody else that wants to learn

00:29.495 --> 00:37.578
more about how A&M truly came to be what it is today. 
And I remember in the early 60s, your key, key role

00:44.345 --> 00:46.367
Let's go back before A&M. Would you please, so that 
any scholar might want to know about your

00:46.508 --> 00:55.839
background, describe your background before you 
came to A&M. Okay, Haskell. I saw light of day in

00:58.422 --> 01:10.656
Montana on the boondocks of northwestern Montana 
on a cattle wheat ranch where my dad had

00:58.422 --> 01:10.656
homesteaded in the early days. But my mother got 
tired of the wilds and wanted the kids to have

01:10.636 --> 01:19.816
better education that was available in our 
surroundings in Montana. So she insisted we go

01:19.836 --> 01:25.007
back to Iowa, which was the native state of both 
originally. And we did. I grew up on a western Iowa

01:26.270 --> 01:30.940
farm. a poor country kid in a family of thirteen 
children. And all of us went through high school

01:36.130 --> 01:41.200
and many through college. I guess we learned our 
lessons in the dirt of the Iowa hills. From there I

01:47.913 --> 01:52.160
went to the University of Iowa. When I finished, my 
wife and I became married for a short while

01:53.942 --> 02:08.705
together because World War II was beckoning and I 
enlisted in the Navy

01:53.942 --> 02:08.705
six months after I received my degree. I served in 
the Navy in all the theaters of action. And

02:14.474 --> 02:32.128
although unknown at the time, the landings at the 
Omaha beachhead where old Rudder led it with his

02:14.474 --> 02:32.128
rangers, my destroyer squadron escorted them to 
the beachhead and gave them the fire support from

02:14.474 --> 02:32.128
the seaward side during the landings. Oh. What was 
your destroyer's name? It was the USS Frankfurt,

02:34.952 --> 02:37.155
the 497. At that time, we were part of the Destroyer 
Squadron 18, which gave a lot of the fire support

02:37.976 --> 02:50.235
for the landings, not only at Omaha, but at Utah 
Beach and the others there. After the war, I went

02:50.215 --> 03:11.200
back to Iowa City, where my wife was living at the 
time, and where we had gone to school at the

02:50.215 --> 03:11.200
university, and mulling over what to do, whether 
to go back into education or find a job or what. I was

03:12.402 --> 03:18.349
talking with the former head of my department, and 
he said, Well, why don't you come back and go to

03:12.402 --> 03:18.349
graduate school? He said, the GI Bill will pay your 
way, and I was partly disabled, doing a disabled

03:19.274 --> 03:27.521
veteran thing and got special things. 
Essentially got my way paid through graduate

03:27.541 --> 03:30.144
school. Received my Ph.D. in two years there. 
Majored in? I majored in biochemistry and

03:35.048 --> 03:39.112
physiology. My thesis was written in plant 
physiology because my major professor was a plant

03:39.152 --> 03:49.281
physiologist.

03:49.261 --> 03:59.030
I

03:49.261 --> 03:59.030
took the best job I thought was available at the 
time, which was University of Kentucky as

03:49.261 --> 03:59.030
assistant professor of botany.

04:03.895 --> 04:09.940
While there, after two months, the department 
chairman came in, whose name was Dr. Herbert

04:03.895 --> 04:09.940
Riley. He said, Hall, I'm going to Oak Ridge. I've 
got a scholarship. I want to make you the acting

04:14.485 --> 04:16.567
department chair. I said, what? I was the only 
assistant professor in the thing, the new kid on

04:18.370 --> 04:25.509
the block, and here were the others who were full 
professors and so forth. But then I found out

04:25.910 --> 04:33.409
shortly the reason, because none of them would 
talk to each other, and I was the only one he could

04:25.910 --> 04:33.409
get to take the job. Well, anyway, we ended up and I 
got with all the workload of being chairman and

04:33.845 --> 04:43.461
starting a new career as a teacher, researcher. I 
had to give up research when I took over the

04:43.501 --> 04:45.985
chairmanship. I got a call from Texas A&M, one of my 
former graduate school colleagues had taken a job

04:47.528 --> 04:54.680
at A&M. Now what year was that call? That was in 
1948. His name was Dr. Wayne McElrath.

05:07.201 --> 05:09.707
He wanted to know if I was interested in coming to 
Texas A&M. They had an assistant professorship

05:09.727 --> 05:14.078
available in their department, which had been 
following the reorganization of 1948. I don't

05:17.285 --> 05:22.509
know if you recall, the whole A&M system was 
reorganized at that time. In fact, it was brought

05:23.550 --> 05:27.154
in, the first chancellor was appointed, Gib 
Gilchrist. And I got to talking with Wayne, both

05:28.915 --> 05:34.260
names, of course, were Wayne. I called him Mac and 
said, Mac, sounds interesting. I said, have the

05:39.125 --> 05:42.968
department chairman call me and we'll talk. So he 
did, whose name was Dr. Albert Dunlap at that time.

05:48.196 --> 05:52.183
He called, and he finally, after about three 
months, convinced me to come to A&M. Kept raising

05:52.864 --> 05:57.471
the salary, which was great in those days, because 
salaries were very low. What was your beginning

05:58.853 --> 06:01.117
salary? The beginning salary here was $5,200, 
whereas the Kentucky was $4,400. And this was for

06:08.769 --> 06:10.812
12 months. No, originally it was for nine months, 
but the promise I'd be made in a 12-month

06:11.112 --> 06:18.444
appointment through the Texas Agriculture 
Experiment Station. I was in the College of

06:18.484 --> 06:20.788
Agriculture. And Dr. Lewis, or D. Lewis, did 
promise me a 25% appointment in the Experiment

06:21.689 --> 06:31.064
Station, which came the following year. And, 
well, that's how I came to A&M. All right. So you

06:36.292 --> 06:38.113
arrived in the fall of 40? 49. It was the summer, 
actually. Summer of 49. Describe the campus as you

06:42.757 --> 06:47.421
first saw it. Well, I won't paint it quite as bleak 
as I did in this little treatise I did on A&M. But it

06:53.627 --> 07:01.233
was after being used to the lush green grass of 
Kentucky, the blue grass area. Literally, it is a

07:01.333 --> 07:03.055
beautiful area. Oh, it's beautiful. When we came 
in, it was in August, the middle of August. In those

07:08.783 --> 07:16.294
days, they didn't water the campus, and they'd 
been in a prolonged drought for some three years,

07:08.783 --> 07:16.294
and the dust was blowing. It was sort of a 
disheartening experience. In fact, I can

07:20.981 --> 07:30.715
remember Dorothy saying, kids got out, we arrived 
on the campus, didn't know where to go, so we parked

07:20.981 --> 07:30.715
what looked like sort of a garage area. And the dust 
was blowing. And Dorothy said, my gosh, I hope we

07:33.978 --> 07:37.845
wished we had not left Kentucky. And the kids were 
hungry and wanted to find something to eat. And I

07:41.532 --> 07:44.277
was trying to find the place where I was to go. And I 
hailed what turned out to be an Aggie student in his

07:44.298 --> 07:53.715
uniform, even though it was summertime, but he was 
still in uniform. And I said, can you tell me where

07:54.269 --> 07:58.800
the Department of Plant Physiology and Pathology 
is located? He said, sure. He said, it's right next

07:59.402 --> 08:01.206
to the building where I work. So he escorted me 
across, and I met Dr. Dunlap, and that's where I

08:01.928 --> 08:07.101
started. And where did you all live when you first 
Dr. Dunlap agreed when he hired me that he would

08:11.178 --> 08:19.854
find a home for us, a house to rent. We had agreed the 
price we were willing to pay, which was small in

08:20.555 --> 08:27.988
those days, and it was over in Bryan. The former, 
the mayor of Bryan at that time owned the house. And

08:32.774 --> 08:34.917
Dr. Dunlap knew him. He was a former Aggie. And, 
well, one of the lakes up near Hearn is named after

08:37.780 --> 08:43.167
him now, Dansby. Oh. Roland Dansby. Roland, 
uh-huh, sure. And he was in a number of businesses.

08:49.174 --> 08:51.317
He had an insurance business. He had a ranch farm. 
Oh, I don't know, he had half a dozen things in the

08:55.542 --> 08:58.785
fire at the time. He was very active, and he was a 
real southern gentleman. And we lived there, and

09:03.130 --> 09:14.442
of course commuting back and forth and having only 
one old beat-up Ford, it became a real problem for

09:03.130 --> 09:14.442
Dorothy to get out to get anything. So finally I 
said, why don't we look and see if we can get closer

09:14.542 --> 09:18.286
to the campus? Maybe we can get close enough I can 
walk to work, and you can have the car then and do

09:18.406 --> 09:25.313
whatever you want to do. We found a little new 
apartment being built on Second Street across

09:25.833 --> 09:34.645
from the Presbyterian Church there. At 
Northgate. At Northgate, yeah. It was brand new.

09:38.931 --> 09:44.959
It was very small, but it was new, and it was without 
air conditioning. Nothing was air conditioned in

09:44.999 --> 09:54.372
those days, so we got a water cooler, which only 
partly worked, and eventually got a window air

09:44.999 --> 09:54.372
conditioner. So I could walk. I actually walked 
from Northgate to the campus each morning, or most

09:56.157 --> 10:01.504
mornings anyway. You were in the Department of 
Plant? Plant Physiology and Pathology, which had

10:04.408 --> 10:08.374
been formed in 1948. How many were in that 
department then, do you remember? Oh, I think

10:13.555 --> 10:20.665
there was ten professors, ranging all the way from 
assistant professor to full professor. And the

10:21.606 --> 10:23.169
dean in those days? The dean in those days was Dr. 
Shepardson, who was a dairy scientist in

10:23.850 --> 10:30.760
agriculture. And in 1950, I believe it was, no, no, 
no, 1954, He was offered a position on the Federal

10:39.492 --> 10:50.991
Reserve Bank in Washington, which he took, which 
was a real plum in those days, to be invited from

10:39.492 --> 10:50.991
little podunk college to Washington. And he left, 
and

10:51.752 --> 11:04.133
Jimmy Adams, who was the formerly head of agronomy 
and soil science, became dean. And it progressed

11:04.113 --> 11:14.465
from there to Adams left, and they invited the 
chairman of our department to become dean of

11:04.113 --> 11:14.465
agriculture, Gus Watkins. You probably remember 
Gus. Oh yes, yes. The chief academic officer at

11:18.590 --> 11:26.058
that time was called the dean of the college? Yeah, 
in those days all of the regular deans of the

11:26.138 --> 11:33.867
schools, and there were just a few colleges 
originally. Reported to the dean of the college,

11:34.522 --> 11:38.887
who was the chief academic officer under the 
president. And that was whom? Well, it eventually

11:40.829 --> 11:47.157
became John Paul Abbott in about 1950, but 
originally it was not. In between John Paul was Dr.

11:48.698 --> 11:55.686
Morgan, who became president.

11:56.748 --> 11:58.870
Let's talk about Dr. Abbott for a moment. Okay. 
Characterize him. Oh, I would call him a true

12:01.808 --> 12:06.784
southern gentleman in the best sense of the word. 
He was very considerate of people, kindly in his

12:07.787 --> 12:12.322
approach to people. A real Jew, in my opinion. He 
may not have been the best or the greatest of the

12:15.494 --> 12:21.542
scholars, but he was a true professor. And the 
president when you arrived? The president was Dr.

12:25.547 --> 12:30.673
Bolton, and Gib Gilchrist was the chancellor. 
They had just formed the system at that time.

12:33.957 --> 12:41.347
Gilchrist had been president, but he moved to the 
chancellorship, and Bolton became the

12:33.957 --> 12:41.347
president. Was he a vigorous leader, Bolton? No, 
in fact there's hardly anything that registers on

12:44.823 --> 12:51.714
my mind that I would call it really happened 
outstanding. I can't remember hearing anyone

12:51.754 --> 12:54.900
else mention it. He was more or less, I shouldn't 
say this but I will, he was more or less fulfilling a

12:55.000 --> 13:01.390
position as far as I was concerned. But in those 
days I was so busy with being a professor teaching

13:01.991 --> 13:09.363
and doing research that I cared less about the 
higher echelon. What about Gilchrist? Gilchrist

13:11.215 --> 13:13.360
was an able administrator. He was tough as nails 
and hard to get along with. And you better hew to his

13:16.807 --> 13:20.655
line or you were on the same wavelength. Did you 
faculty members see the president or the

13:20.675 --> 13:24.223
chancellor much? Very seldom.

13:28.782 --> 13:35.554
I didn't meet Dr. Gilchrist or Dr. Bolton to one of 
the social affairs. I never met him when I was

13:35.574 --> 13:38.179
interviewed or anything. Do you remember what 
your first workloads were, teaching and

13:38.900 --> 13:44.410
research? Well, it sounds rather fantastic in 
terms of modern schedules.

13:52.019 --> 14:03.277
I had four sections, laboratory sections of 
beginning plant physiology, which I handled

13:52.019 --> 14:03.277
myself with one graduate student who only helped 
me in one of them. And I taught two

14:03.297 --> 14:11.670
and three courses besides managing the 
laboratories. It was about twenty-two,

14:12.972 --> 14:16.558
twenty-four hours, contact hours. And it was made 
clear you were expected to do research in

14:17.365 --> 14:21.831
addition. Oh, yeah. I can never forget when I, I did 
meet Dean Shepardson when I first came and

14:22.392 --> 14:28.680
subsequently. In fact, I will never forget when he 
called me in to review, they did a faculty

14:29.942 --> 14:43.120
assessment student rating of professors, which 
was the first time they'd done it at A&M. He called

14:43.741 --> 14:47.405
me in to review the results, although I'd got a copy 
of them myself. I thought they were quite good. I

14:50.108 --> 14:53.332
kind of was cocky in those days, maybe still. I 
walked over to get his accolades. I didn't get

14:56.235 --> 14:57.516
accolades at all. He said, Hall, you have one bad 
point here. If you don't improve it, you won't be

15:01.180 --> 15:03.403
around next year. One bad, he didn't say anything 
about the good points. No. Later, after he went to

15:08.288 --> 15:12.533
Washington, the Federal Reserve Board, He wrote 
me a letter back saying, Dr. Hall, I always knew you

15:12.952 --> 15:21.683
were a good teacher, regardless of what I told you 
in my office. Now, in those early years, were there

15:23.585 --> 15:28.912
merit salary increases? No, not regular salary 
increases. In fact, the maximum that anybody got,

15:35.280 --> 15:39.685
which usually, unless they were threatening to 
leave or had a counter offer to meet. It was about

15:44.449 --> 15:46.532
$200 a year. I got regular, every time there was a 
salary increase, I got a salary increase. And the

15:51.539 --> 15:54.904
major increase is when I made associate 
professorship. I got $400 increase. Hey, 400 a

15:56.947 --> 15:58.349
year. Yeah. And I think when I made full professor, 
I got something like $1,000 increase. All right,

16:04.017 --> 16:06.341
now you arrived as an assistant professor. As an 
assistant professor. And you became a full

16:07.122 --> 16:10.026
professor how many years later? In 1954. So in five 
years you went. Yeah. It was the year before I, well

16:15.448 --> 16:19.375
I don't have the watch on, but you got one of them. 
The first of those were given in 1955, and I made

16:19.395 --> 16:24.764
full professor the year before. And you got one of 
them that year or the next year? No, I got one of the

16:27.850 --> 16:30.815
first of the first five ever given. That's what I 
thought. Yeah, mine was combination for teaching

16:33.428 --> 16:55.572
and research which they abolished the second year 
and became made it split it out into either

16:33.428 --> 16:55.572
research or teaching then they were four given 
wait excuse me three given in teaching one in

16:33.428 --> 16:55.572
teaching and research and one in student 
relations now when you received yours was it done

16:33.428 --> 16:55.572
as it was with mine a total surprise Oh yeah, I 
didn't even know I'd been nominated. Same here.

16:59.561 --> 17:05.307
Gus Watkins later told me that he was instrumental 
in making the nomination. He got a number of other

17:05.687 --> 17:08.010
people to support it. No, I didn't know it. In fact, 
we were over to, oh, it's abolished now where they

17:10.232 --> 17:16.539
used to hold the faculty meetings. In Guyon Hall. 
Guyon Hall, right. And I went over there and I was

17:20.183 --> 17:25.288
just sort of relaxed and listening to the chatter, 
you know. trying to get the thing over with so I

17:25.690 --> 17:30.061
could go home after it was late in the afternoon. 
And all of a sudden they called my name and I

17:30.542 --> 17:33.750
staggered up there. I actually thought I was never 
going to make it up there. My knees were so weak I

17:36.416 --> 17:40.847
could hardly walk up to the podium. I think for all 
of us, that was an unforgettable day.

17:48.528 --> 17:58.465
How would you characterize the College of 
Agriculture at that point in terms of its

17:48.528 --> 17:58.465
emphasis, its momentum? Well, I have to give Dean 
Shepardson and others, his predecessors, a lot of

17:59.086 --> 18:07.516
credit for building up a real fine school of 
agriculture. In fact, in those days when I came

18:07.536 --> 18:11.241
here, the reputation of A&M was in agriculture. It 
wasn't in engineering, despite what some of the

18:11.521 --> 18:15.846
engineers might want you to think. Engineering 
did develop strongly when I was there, but

18:16.327 --> 18:26.018
agriculture and engineering was what A&M stood 
for, and it still was in those early days that I was

18:16.327 --> 18:26.018
here. And by and large, the faculty had done their 
doctoral degrees all across the nation, hadn't

18:29.326 --> 18:32.290
they? Oh, yeah. They were excellent teachers. I 
would hire any number of those early people. Many

18:40.421 --> 18:45.928
of them had offers to go to more prestigious 
places, and they stayed because they liked it

18:40.421 --> 18:45.928
here. Where was the department housed? Our 
department was housed in several buildings. We

18:54.993 --> 19:07.351
didn't have a central location, but the main 
office, the headship or the chairman's, was in the

18:54.993 --> 19:07.351
old Ag Experiment Station, the red building, 
which subsequently was destroyed. I was housed.

19:09.294 --> 19:12.699
My office was in Old Science Hall, which also has 
been long gone. And a number of others were strung

19:13.780 --> 19:15.643
around. That's where they could find an office for 
them. And your classes also were scattered. Oh,

19:20.189 --> 19:20.690
yeah. We didn't have a classroom where we could 
call our own, except one small one. We had the

19:25.457 --> 19:29.342
laboratories, but you couldn't hold the lecture 
section. In fact, there were large lecture

19:29.362 --> 19:31.285
sections. I taught 200 to 300 students in some of 
the lectures. Where were those classes held? They

19:38.636 --> 19:40.238
were held either in the large lecture halls like 
chemistry or ag engineering had a big tiered—I

19:40.640 --> 19:47.113
don't know if you remember. I can remember—well,

19:49.759 --> 19:56.272
I won't say what I was going to say. And your 
research, how did—what was your beginning

19:57.695 --> 20:02.344
research topic? Well, when I was at the University 
of Iowa before I left and at Kentucky, I started to

20:03.100 --> 20:14.666
work on the role of ethylene in plants and in 
organisms in general. And I got interrupted

20:15.949 --> 20:21.020
because I was made acting head here in Kentucky. I 
came here and The first year I was doing research

20:24.397 --> 20:30.022
just on my own, no sponsorship. I continued some of 
the ethylene research that I had started in

20:30.082 --> 20:33.566
Kentucky. But the second year, Dr. Lewis gave me a 
25 percent appointment in the Ag Experiment

20:34.286 --> 20:40.192
Station. Of course, that had to have some 
practical foundation. So I decided, being that

20:46.177 --> 20:54.285
ethylene was involved in an incision, to do a 
project on cotton defoliation. and actually

20:54.738 --> 21:01.957
developed, made it possible for mechanical 
harvesting of cotton, not only in Texas, but

20:54.738 --> 21:01.957
elsewhere. And I say in my book without any false 
modesty, I think we established the real And you

21:10.178 --> 21:12.484
had not done cotton research before? I hadn't seen 
a cotton plant before I came to Texas, no. And about

21:17.235 --> 21:25.555
how long did it take from beginning of that 
research to have results that made you proud? Oh, I

21:26.463 --> 21:38.204
was publishing or starting to write up papers from 
what I'd done in my graduate work at Kentucky all

21:26.463 --> 21:38.204
along when I was teaching, even at night. And as 
soon as I started active research, I was turning

21:41.971 --> 21:44.954
out two and three papers a year at least. And the 
cotton project, how? Oh, immediately. You had to

21:49.138 --> 21:57.385
write your results up in what they called progress 
reports, which were published and distributed to

21:49.138 --> 21:57.385
the farmers, ranchers. And then how soon did, how 
long did it take from the beginning of your

21:57.766 --> 22:08.856
research to the cotton farmer to start 
defoliating? Oh, I would say eight to ten years,

22:10.186 --> 22:15.099
something like that. Was there any private 
concern, private entrepreneur who became

22:16.181 --> 22:26.187
involved in the, in supporting the research? Oh, 
yeah. That was left mostly from research grants

22:27.889 --> 22:33.477
and contracts. That's mostly what my graduate 
students and I did the research with. I had the

22:39.726 --> 22:46.757
equivalent of about now would be several million 
dollars of sponsored research after about two or

22:39.726 --> 22:46.757
three years after I started there. I got it from the 
National Science Foundation, from National

22:47.738 --> 22:54.047
Institutes of Health, from the Cotton industry, 
National Cotton Council, headquartered in

22:54.027 --> 23:00.936
Memphis, gave me a large grant. They were all 
interested in pushing it, yeah. And it's really,

23:04.680 --> 23:10.968
that's what made the graduate students, their 
support came from all these grants. All right, and

23:10.988 --> 23:16.535
then how, when did you become, begin to become a, 
here, an administrator?

23:19.739 --> 23:23.123
Well, that was in 19...

23:25.010 --> 23:35.210
I became,

23:25.010 --> 23:35.210
though, a department chairman before that. When 
did you chair the department? It was in 1956, I

23:39.357 --> 23:43.566
believe. It's the year that Gus became dean of 
agriculture. He insisted on twisting my arm to

23:47.453 --> 23:56.092
become chairman, which I regretted for a while 
because I wanted to do teaching and research

23:47.453 --> 23:56.092
entirely. But in 1957, it was announced late there 
that even though Dr. Tom Harrington had been both

24:02.506 --> 24:11.955
chancellor and president, that there was a need to 
bring in somebody to be president. That was after

24:11.975 --> 24:15.898
Dave Morgan had left in sort of a huff with the 
board. In fact, to put it bluntly, they fired him,

24:17.039 --> 24:22.244
although it wasn't announced that way. Let's chat 
about him a minute. Now I've heard 99th Hand that he

24:24.086 --> 24:31.753
had some ideas that were kind of similar to to those 
that would become realities in the 60s. That is

24:36.439 --> 24:37.861
entirely correct. My book was a man with a lot of 
vision and a capable administrator. But he got out

24:44.592 --> 24:50.721
of sync with the people that managed A&M He wanted 
to push things too fast. A&M was not responsive in

24:53.343 --> 24:56.606
those days for change. Right. Now, was Dr. 
Harrington already? Dr. Harrington, when I first

25:02.432 --> 25:20.708
came here, Dr. Harrington was assistant dean of 
arts and sciences, and he was managing the O'Brien

25:02.432 --> 25:20.708
Air Force Base activity where a lot of the former 
military people were coming in to go to school. And

25:20.688 --> 25:23.772
then he became dean of arts and sciences. From 
there he became dean of the college. He became

25:30.241 --> 25:33.886
president and then chancellor. Was he chancellor 
over Morgan? No, he became chancellor after

25:38.912 --> 25:42.918
Gilchrist. So it was Gilchrist and Morgan that 
didn't jive as well as they might have. Yeah. No, to

25:50.540 --> 26:00.719
my knowledge, Tom Harrington and Morgan got along 
all right, but it was members of the board of

25:50.540 --> 26:00.719
directors we called in those days. They didn't 
call them regents or any of it. Was there any

26:03.224 --> 26:11.299
director that you know of who was more potent than 
the others in dealing with Morgan? Yeah, I knew

26:13.152 --> 26:15.675
most of them at the time. Pete Peterson from Fort 
Worth was on the board at that time. The engineer,

26:20.280 --> 26:27.467
trying to think of his name, there's a building 
named after him on the campus. He was from

26:28.468 --> 26:29.509
Beaumont. He had a brother that also served on the 
board at one time, a German name. Not Hal Booty? No,

26:37.578 --> 26:38.699
Hal Booty. Because he's Lebanese, he's later. No, 
it was

26:41.502 --> 26:48.433
Evans was on the board during those years. Well, it 
became not initially when I was here, but later.

26:53.681 --> 26:58.388
And the man from San Antonio, I'm trying to think. 
We'll think of those later. All right. So Morgan is

27:02.113 --> 27:05.138
gone. And then Mr. Rudder. is brought over a little 
later, in 58 or 9? He was brought over in 58,

27:15.663 --> 27:21.315
although the negotiations apparently happened 
in late 57. Do you have any idea of who the people

27:24.213 --> 27:28.540
were and what the process was that identified him. 
Yeah. Tony Heldenfels was the man I was trying to

27:31.165 --> 27:35.232
think of from Beaumont, was one of them. Sterling 
Evans, Pete Peterson,

27:43.366 --> 27:47.895
Oh, the Boydell, Dr. Boydell. And there were 
several other men from Amarillo. Oh, don't get

27:54.948 --> 27:58.074
old. My memory's getting bad. I can't remember 
him. Begins with a W, I think. Yeah, if I had my book

28:05.894 --> 28:08.478
here. No, that's all right. It's in that book. 
We'll get that later in the second draft. They were

28:12.424 --> 28:14.387
the main ones, I think. Do you have any idea how they 
came to identify Rudder? Well, the same way that I

28:19.835 --> 28:23.180
think most of the people in Texas knew him. He was a 
famous war hero, and the governor enticed him to

28:23.240 --> 28:32.273
leave his ranch to clean up the land scandal, 
rocked land office, which he did magnificently.

28:42.992 --> 28:45.955
And people said, there's a natural leader. And of 
course, military-minded people were very much

28:46.836 --> 28:51.862
part of A&M at that time. And they were looking for a 
leader. They weren't looking for an academician.

28:59.149 --> 29:02.513
And do you recall your first impression of Mr. 
Rutter? Yeah, I was always impressed with Mr.

29:04.062 --> 29:06.725
Rutter. He was a dynamic individual. If you didn't 
sit in his presence, you weren't impressed with

29:08.427 --> 29:14.955
him, or at least I was impressed with him. He 
admitted to me right from the start that he didn't

29:17.397 --> 29:22.523
know much about academics. He says, that's why I'm 
hiring you, Hall. He hired me first as graduate

29:25.186 --> 29:27.589
dean. But I really was dean of the college is what I 
was doing. All right. Now, when did that occur?

29:33.795 --> 29:37.143
That was in 1958. 1958. So soon after he got here. 
Oh, yeah. He interviewed me. The first thing he did

29:43.076 --> 29:45.662
was hire Dorsey McCrory. as his administrative 
assistant. And he sent Dorothy out all around the

29:50.208 --> 30:05.107
campus to find candidates for appoint, because 
Boyd Page had left and announced just after Rutter

29:50.208 --> 30:05.107
was appointed that he was going to Iowa State as 
vice president, which he did. And he told us in the

30:06.588 --> 30:11.835
inner circle he was leaving several months before 
it was made public. But immediately, Rutter

30:11.815 --> 30:14.639
started to look for a replacement. And he sent 
Dorsey all around the campus and different places

30:15.300 --> 30:21.109
to get information and so forth. And he called me 
in. I had met him previously, and I was still

30:23.533 --> 30:27.459
chairman of the department at the time. And we were 
building a new building, the Plant Sciences

30:28.320 --> 30:33.307
Building, and I was having a ball doing it all. And 
he called me in, and I thought he wanted to ask me how

30:33.928 --> 30:38.295
the Plant Science Building was coming. All of a 
sudden he lowered the boom on me and said, Hall, I

30:38.782 --> 30:45.092
like your research and teaching record. Would you 
like to be graduate dean? And he bowed, floored me.

30:49.939 --> 30:51.382
That was the last thing I had in mind. Was that Mr. 
Rutter or was that McCrory? That was Mr. Rutter.

30:54.607 --> 30:55.128
Mr. Rutter. Mr. Rutter didn't delegate things 
except the nasty things to people that he didn't

30:55.228 --> 30:59.735
want to do. Now where did he office then? In the Koch 
building? He was in the Richard Koch building. And

31:08.701 --> 31:11.265
It became the president. He didn't have the 
president's suite to start with, but he had it a few

31:11.826 --> 31:16.372
days. All right, so you became graduate dean when? 
As I recall, it was 1958, late in 58. No, my

31:25.065 --> 31:29.372
appointment was announced July 58. And the dean of 
the college then was whom? And we didn't have a dean

31:35.633 --> 31:37.258
of the college. Boyd Page had been both graduate 
dean and dean of the college, and he had left before

31:37.318 --> 31:44.580
I even assumed his office.
