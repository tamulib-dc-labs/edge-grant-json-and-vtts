WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:04.715
Let me say one more thing about Pete Rodriguez.

00:04.735 --> 00:07.279
Yeah, we were talking about Pete Rodriguez, what a key man he is.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.562
He is the straightest guy you can imagine.

00:11.484 --> 00:21.978
All kinds of salespeople would come through that department, and of course, Pete was the purchasing agent, and they'd all come in there and want to give him Christmas presents.

00:22.098 --> 00:25.342
He never accepted a Christmas present.

00:25.363 --> 00:26.985
They wanted to take him out to lunch.

00:27.185 --> 00:31.050
He never went out to lunch with any salesman.

00:32.043 --> 00:38.895
And he had that task for all the years that you were a faculty member?

00:38.915 --> 00:41.680
Long before and a good while after.

00:42.701 --> 00:44.104
What was his official title?

00:44.144 --> 00:44.525
Do you know?

00:44.945 --> 00:51.096
Well, I guess he was a chemistry department purchasing agent, I think was his title.

00:51.417 --> 00:56.886
He purchased all of the chemicals, glassware, supplies.

00:57.507 --> 01:03.015
things of that sort, and I guess even furniture and things of that kind.

01:03.756 --> 01:08.583
But Pete was, he's one of my favorite people.

01:09.224 --> 01:19.279
And he, you know, little Pete, his son, had a sudden heart attack while he was playing handball a number of years ago, almost tore them apart, he and his wife.

01:21.522 --> 01:24.426
And he said a year or so ago to me,

01:25.165 --> 01:29.155
I'd like to see Bernie one more time.

01:33.686 --> 01:37.134
You were mentioning that... We're going this spring.

01:37.154 --> 01:38.297
I'm taking him back out there.

01:44.116 --> 01:53.406
You were saying that Dr. Calloway, his illness, then you for a year were the interim, then who... That was not the first.

01:53.767 --> 01:58.552
Bryn Oswalinski was the first acting head.

01:59.072 --> 02:01.655
Who then became the permanent head after that?

02:03.077 --> 02:04.358
The president.

02:04.618 --> 02:13.448
I made a list of all the people who I needed to remember.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.238
and Art Martell did.

02:16.438 --> 02:17.500
Oh is that when Art comes?

02:17.760 --> 02:17.941
Yeah.

02:17.961 --> 02:19.243
About when was that?

02:20.305 --> 02:23.570
He came the year after I was acting head.

02:23.650 --> 02:39.057
I was acting head in the 1963-64 or 64-65 I believe.

02:39.297 --> 02:39.958
How did

02:40.529 --> 02:43.473
How did Art Martell get identified?

02:44.234 --> 02:45.816
I identified him.

02:46.577 --> 02:46.918
How?

02:46.938 --> 02:47.238
Why?

02:48.780 --> 02:49.982
That's a good story, too.

02:51.444 --> 03:04.461
Let me go back and tell you what happened when Paul Calloway became ill and Bruno Volensky agreed to be acting head for a year.

03:04.441 --> 03:12.291
Hubert was dean of arts and sciences at the time and

03:12.997 --> 03:20.846
Bruno, Diodo Bruno, well, you know, he's not very tactful at times.

03:22.187 --> 03:40.067
Nice guy, one of my favorite people, but Bruno gets himself into trouble because he says things at the wrong time in the wrong way at times, and the year he was acting head, Charlie Squire was

03:40.047 --> 03:45.615
acting dean of science, or dean of arts and science.

03:45.715 --> 03:49.860
I guess, I can't remember when it was changed over, but about that time.

03:51.022 --> 04:04.541
And Bruno and Squire got it cross-purposes, and that wasn't hard to do because Squire, I found, was a very difficult person to deal with too at times.

04:05.582 --> 04:07.725
And so,

04:07.705 --> 04:21.940
At the end of that year, Bruno came to me and said, Tex, the administration doesn't seem to be very fast in trying to find a permanent head, but I can't do it again.

04:22.621 --> 04:28.567
He said, I've gotten into too much trouble with Charlie Squire.

04:28.587 --> 04:34.033
He and I, if I want something, he simply vetoes it.

04:34.756 --> 04:37.641
doesn't even think about it, you just automatically reclose it.

04:38.843 --> 04:54.089
And he said, I've talked to some of the other people, and I think that included Hubert, and I wish you would agree to be acting head for next year.

04:54.410 --> 04:59.278
I said, Bruno, not what I want to do at all really isn't

05:00.170 --> 05:14.052
And I tried to argue him out of it, and so then Hubert came over and said, we need an acting head of the chemistry department in the worst way.

05:14.473 --> 05:15.735
We'd like for you to do it.

05:16.376 --> 05:22.325
You will only have it for one year, I promise you, and we'll find a permanent head.

05:22.525 --> 05:27.493
And I said, okay, I will agree to do it for one year, but no more.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.447
It's not what I enjoy doing.

05:32.129 --> 05:37.615
And the year I was acting head, I found out some other reasons why I didn't enjoy a day.

05:38.836 --> 05:40.138
I like to deal with people.

05:40.258 --> 05:42.160
I don't have any problem with that generally.

05:44.082 --> 05:48.748
But I would get an agenda for the academic council meeting.

05:50.229 --> 05:52.472
You know what I'm going to say, I'm sure.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.177
It would start at two o'clock and I'd think, well, gee, there's nothing on this

05:57.443 --> 05:59.446
list that's going to take any time.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.923
I'll go over there and spend about

06:01.274 --> 06:02.836
thirty minutes and be back.

06:03.196 --> 06:22.460
God darn, I'd go over there and spendâ€”it'd be five o'clock at least before I could get back to my office, and every time I'd be just fuming, because people like Squire would get up and harangue some subject, which was not important, really.

06:22.480 --> 06:30.370
It wasn't going to solve anything particularly important in the university, and I'd waste three hours over there.

06:31.936 --> 06:32.557
Anyway.

06:32.577 --> 06:38.845
All right, then.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.209
How, why, Martell?

06:43.290 --> 06:43.751
I'll tell you.

06:46.374 --> 06:54.044
I, at the, in January, a new dean of science came in.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.828
His name was Zener, physicist.

06:58.409 --> 06:59.751
Very fine gentleman.

06:59.771 --> 07:01.673
I liked Zener very much.

07:02.497 --> 07:09.991
And so fairly quickly, I went over to see him, and I said, I'm acting head of the chemistry department this year.

07:10.331 --> 07:13.718
For one year, please start finding somebody else.

07:13.738 --> 07:20.370
And he said, you know, that's not number one of my agenda right now.

07:20.705 --> 07:25.952
We badly need to find some people in physics and in mathematics.

07:26.032 --> 07:30.859
And he said, you're doing a great job over there in the chemistry department.

07:30.879 --> 07:31.761
I said, no, I'm not.

07:31.821 --> 07:36.667
I'm just trying to hold a fork down until a permanent head comes along.

07:36.728 --> 07:39.912
I just don't enjoy this kind of job.

07:40.297 --> 07:50.329
Well, you think about it, I think you'd, and he, every time I'd go over there, he'd try to talk me into becoming permanent head.

07:50.389 --> 08:02.163
And I said, finally, time went on and it was, it was, I believe in April, March anyway.

08:03.405 --> 08:09.612
And I went over there and I said, look, time, this academic year is about gone.

08:10.283 --> 08:13.648
And I don't see any evidence of anybody looking for department ed.

08:13.668 --> 08:17.614
And I'm not going to be the department ed next year.

08:17.815 --> 08:20.078
I want to tell you this in all honesty.

08:20.940 --> 08:24.245
I've done what I agreed to do and I'm not going to do it.

08:27.430 --> 08:32.738
And he sat there for a little bit and he said, do you have any idea who we might get?

08:32.778 --> 08:34.080
And I said,

08:34.702 --> 08:40.173
All you have to do is to tell me, I have the authority to look around.

08:40.193 --> 08:41.556
I'm not going to hire anybody.

08:42.478 --> 08:49.251
The administration hires them, but I look, and I have contacts.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.533
and I'll try to find somebody.

08:51.653 --> 08:59.189
So one of the people I called was a fellow by the name of George Hammond, who was a, you know who George Hammond is?

08:59.269 --> 09:00.111
That name rings bell.

09:00.512 --> 09:10.513
Well, he was a very distinguished chemist in those days at California Institute of Technology, Caltech.

09:10.493 --> 09:14.559
and he and I had become good friends.

09:14.599 --> 09:33.769
We'd run in together, one another, frequently at national chemical meetings, and I said, George, you have any idea who might, we're looking for a permanent head of the chemistry department, you have any idea who we might contact?

09:34.290 --> 09:37.395
And he said, well, let me think a little bit and I'll call you back.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.919
George was one of these guys that knew all kinds of people in the chemistry profession.

09:43.040 --> 09:48.765
And he knew what was going on in their lives and things like that in many cases.

09:48.846 --> 09:59.275
And he finally called me back and he said, call Art Martell at IIT, Illinois Institute of Technology.

09:59.595 --> 10:05.661
He's just getting a divorce from his wife, and I think he wants to get out of Chicago.

10:06.181 --> 10:09.128
and he's been a good department head up there.

10:09.148 --> 10:14.742
He knows how to be a good department head, and he might be available.

10:16.066 --> 10:23.143
And so I gave Zener his name, and they contacted him, and that's how Art Mertel was hired.

10:24.997 --> 10:39.585
And he showed up about the day before I took a leave of absence to spend a year at Stanford University working on an NSF project out there.

10:40.286 --> 10:42.350
And so it worked out fine.

10:42.390 --> 10:47.460
I finally got rid of it and Art came in.

10:47.440 --> 11:01.603
For those of us who were observers in that era, it seemed that somehow chemistry had been designated for high priority growth and development.

11:01.623 --> 11:05.449
I don't think there's much doubt of that, although I don't

11:05.935 --> 11:08.698
have any details on this at all.

11:09.119 --> 11:09.619
That's right.

11:12.182 --> 11:13.143
But I think it's true.

11:13.163 --> 11:25.758
I don't think there's much question that they gave Art Martell a pretty free hand to go out and build a really first-class chemistry department.

11:25.778 --> 11:31.605
Where did the money come from, do you know?

11:33.138 --> 11:39.106
I don't know that it came from any unusual sources.

11:39.226 --> 11:55.547
The Welch Foundation, of course, they provide the research funds for a Welch professor, but they do not pay his salary.

11:55.567 --> 12:00.934
And there was not a federal grant to say OK Chemistry.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.436
No, there was not.

12:02.416 --> 12:06.284
But let me tell you one other thing that goes back a little earlier.

12:06.865 --> 12:11.534
I got myself in real trouble, not many years after I got here.

12:13.238 --> 12:17.286
I got one of the first Welch grants.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.162
I got to thank him one day.

12:20.202 --> 12:34.681
You know, you had to be contacted by the Welch Foundation and requested to, or told that they would be willing to accept your application for a grant.

12:35.102 --> 12:44.374
You could not, it's the only foundation I know of, you could not go to and ask for a grant.

12:44.394 --> 12:47.138
And so I,

12:48.502 --> 12:49.248
the uh,

12:51.742 --> 12:55.748
Director of research of the Welch Foundation at that time was W.O.

12:57.791 --> 12:58.372
Milligan.

12:58.392 --> 12:59.794
I don't know whether you know W.O.

12:59.814 --> 13:01.797
Milligan or not.

13:01.817 --> 13:18.080
He had been made the kind of the administrator of the Welch Foundation by Doc Daugherty, who was the chairman of A&M Board of Directors, and who had been the assistant of old man Welch.

13:19.162 --> 13:21.445
Welch had left Daugherty a million dollars

13:21.982 --> 13:25.587
to administer this money he left.

13:25.867 --> 13:35.640
And Doherty was a petroleum engineer who hadn't done any petroleum engineering in many years and didn't know anything about chemistry.

13:35.720 --> 13:39.685
So he approached his brother-in-law, W.O.

13:40.046 --> 13:41.307
Milligan at Rice.

13:42.128 --> 13:44.091
I didn't know that relationship.

13:44.331 --> 13:46.874
I knew him when I was a graduate student at Rice in history.

13:47.095 --> 13:50.419
I knew who he was, Dr. Milligan.

13:51.040 --> 14:04.786
That's the way Milligan got his job, and Milligan could be a very strange man.

14:05.708 --> 14:10.036
When Martell got here, what was your first impression of him?

14:10.637 --> 14:13.723
How did he go about getting his task started?

14:13.703 --> 14:16.488
I liked Art very well in the beginning.

14:18.771 --> 14:19.653
We got along well.

14:21.195 --> 14:27.786
He appointed a committee of three or four people in the department to advise him and things of that sort.

14:27.847 --> 14:40.167
We'd sit around frequently and talk about whether we should hire somebody in this area of chemistry or if he had a number of names, what we knew about him, things like that.

14:41.260 --> 14:44.164
But after a while, Art began to go off on his own.

14:44.204 --> 14:48.589
And when that started happening, Art and I parted company.

14:50.171 --> 14:55.218
Art promised me things that he did not deliver and things like that.

14:56.099 --> 15:06.892
And I believe a man, when he says he will do something, and I lose all faith in him when I found out that he doesn't live up to his promises.

15:06.972 --> 15:10.677
And Art has the bad habit of doing this.

15:10.657 --> 15:19.447
And so Art and I still speak to one another, but let me say this.

15:19.628 --> 15:24.033
Art has done a good job of being an administrator in the chemistry department.

15:24.293 --> 15:27.777
He has built up the department very, very well.

15:28.939 --> 15:30.140
I have no problem with that.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.783
When, by comparative

15:33.337 --> 15:39.523
How did the A&M Chemistry Department rank when he arrived, and how does it now?

15:42.126 --> 15:58.602
Right now, all the rankings that I have, honest rankings that I have seen, would put the A&M Chemistry Department high in the top 20.

16:01.518 --> 16:14.537
Not number one, but rapidly overtaking a fair number of really good chemistry departments.

16:15.618 --> 16:16.520
You know, Art did this.

16:17.121 --> 16:25.112
He hired good people, and they came in and produced.

16:29.345 --> 16:39.281
The Welsh professor, I can't think of his name right at the moment, he will win a Nobel Prize in the next two years.

16:39.561 --> 16:44.269
George... It isn't George, it's Alcotton.

16:44.409 --> 16:45.290
Alcotton.

16:46.132 --> 16:50.138
He will win a Nobel Prize.

16:52.075 --> 16:55.027
I was at that time dean of faculties with Calhoun.

16:55.589 --> 16:59.365
How did A&M and Cotton link up?

16:59.485 --> 17:00.128
Do you know?

17:03.415 --> 17:07.579
Martell simply contacted Cotton at MIT.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.681
To start recruiting him?

17:10.482 --> 17:13.424
To work on persuading him to come.

17:13.725 --> 17:23.574
Yes, and apparently it happened at a fortuitous time because something was going on at MIT that was upsetting Cotton pretty badly.

17:24.254 --> 17:30.300
And so he became available at about that time, and he liked the idea that

17:30.280 --> 17:40.966
that he would have a $50,000 a year Welch grant and pretty free reign on what he did.

17:41.026 --> 17:43.492
He teaches very few courses.

17:44.515 --> 17:45.437
He's a researcher.

17:45.991 --> 17:49.656
He's published over 800 scientific publications.

17:49.796 --> 17:53.842
To me, an absolutely incredible accomplishment.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.646
And produced a lot of graduate students.

17:56.806 --> 17:57.367
Oh, man.

17:57.907 --> 18:03.135
He is able to do this because he has the funds to hire lots of postdocs.

18:03.715 --> 18:15.171
Who are the other, from the national observer point of view, who would be the other high recognized chemistry faculty members here?

18:17.480 --> 18:21.445
Oh, there's about 60 people in that department.

18:22.026 --> 18:31.638
I need to go down a list to look at some of these, because I'd hate to overlook some of their names.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.863
But there's a young physical chemist.

18:38.606 --> 18:39.287
What's his name?

18:40.188 --> 18:43.352
I hired him from Rice.

18:44.041 --> 18:47.048
We'll get him in the first draft.

18:47.068 --> 18:49.112
We'll leave a blank and fill that in.

18:49.233 --> 18:56.008
Yeah, he would certainly, he's well recognized.

18:58.047 --> 19:01.672
Let me look at the list.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.013
We'll leave space for that.

19:09.041 --> 19:12.326
Unplug that lapel Mac.

19:12.646 --> 19:13.067
Okay.

19:13.988 --> 19:14.569
I would guess.

19:16.011 --> 19:16.671
Around 1958.

19:16.691 --> 19:17.252
Yup.

19:17.793 --> 19:22.519
I've been here about five years.

19:24.187 --> 19:43.343
I had received a Welch grant and I had made the bad decision to write a couple of letters to the Welch Foundation, to Milligan, being a little bit critical of some of the way they operated.

19:45.247 --> 20:13.853
I suggested that one of the very best things that this organization could do would be to take virtually every assistant professor kid right out of graduate school that comes in here and wants to be a professor, give him

20:15.875 --> 20:19.841
$2,000 to get him started.

20:19.861 --> 20:27.053
$10,000 would be even more than necessary.

20:27.073 --> 20:28.595
$5,000 to $10,000.

20:29.216 --> 20:30.598
Just sort of automatic.

20:32.401 --> 20:39.132
So that the person would have a chance to show what he could really do, they'd come in

20:39.871 --> 20:45.703
At those days, you came in here, there was nothing, you had nothing to work with.

20:46.845 --> 20:51.775
It took you two or three years to get any kind of a research program started.

20:55.482 --> 20:59.230
And then they had an, he didn't think much of that.

21:00.982 --> 21:02.484
They still don't do that.

21:04.566 --> 21:15.400
I think you're still approached by them and told that they will welcome a proposal from you, which I think is the wrong way to do it.

21:17.362 --> 21:30.398
The other thing, they had a restriction that no matter what discoveries you may have come up with, they could not be patented.

21:31.070 --> 21:35.216
that they become the property of everybody.

21:36.518 --> 21:41.486
And so I wrote him another letter and said, I've worked in industry.

21:41.526 --> 21:45.492
This isn't the way things work.

21:45.512 --> 21:59.153
If you have a valuable contribution to society that's patentable, but it needs a little bit of developmental work or something like that, and you don't patent it,

22:00.230 --> 22:01.352
No one's going to touch it.

22:03.736 --> 22:08.463
It's like producing a new drug that'll cure arthritis.

22:10.326 --> 22:20.803
Without a patent on it, everybody and his dog jumps in and makes the drug, or nobody does anything.

22:22.032 --> 22:31.332
Oftentimes, particularly if it needs some developmental work, why spend my work, money developing this thing when everybody else is going to benefit from it?

22:32.755 --> 22:36.323
Well, I didn't think that was a good idea either.

22:37.827 --> 22:41.695
I shouldn't have said either one.

22:43.058 --> 23:08.053
Some years later, I was in the American Chemical Society meeting in Chicago, and we walked out of a session of papers, and there were about 10 of us together, and Milligan was in the group, and my old biochemistry professor at the University of Texas, Roger J. Williams,

23:10.430 --> 23:21.767
a member of the National Academy of Science, a president of the American Chemical Society, certainly one of the most distinguished biochemists of his day.

23:21.787 --> 23:26.654
I took two or three courses from him, a real gentleman.

23:27.996 --> 23:29.478
He had lost his Welsh grant.

23:32.423 --> 23:34.065
I lost my Welsh grant.

23:34.085 --> 23:34.766
I'll tell you why.

23:34.806 --> 23:38.732
Somebody said to Milligan,

23:39.067 --> 23:42.952
understand Dr. Williams, the University of Texas lost his Walsh grant.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.457
Milligan says, yes.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.662
They said, what happened?

23:51.745 --> 23:57.253
His answer was, you don't criticize Santa Claus.

24:01.759 --> 24:06.125
So this is the pompous type that Milligan was.

24:07.086 --> 24:07.487
Well,

24:08.851 --> 24:19.584
I still had my Welch grant, and we were looking for another department head.

24:19.604 --> 24:25.071
I guess this was the time Callaway stepped down.

24:26.633 --> 24:33.441
We had been told by the administration, we had written a letter through the ranks,

24:33.843 --> 24:58.370
and requested that we be allowed to nominate people because we, as a group, had a lot of contacts in the area, and we received a letter back saying, yes, we'll accept your nominations and consider them, but we are the ones that do the hiring.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.133
But fine, no problem with that.

25:01.383 --> 25:04.427
Then some of the strangest people began showing up.

25:05.748 --> 25:20.006
A very distinguished physical chemist from the University of Minnesota, who I knew from my days at General Mills, came down and I knew before he ever arrived that he would not be interested in the job.

25:21.428 --> 25:23.570
He had a great job up there.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.112
Why step down?

25:25.548 --> 25:42.624
Some others, and then one day Callaway called me and said, there's a professor here by the name of Sidney Fox, and he would like to, you know Sidney Fox's name?

25:47.389 --> 25:53.935
He would like to look around the chemistry department, particularly look around at our facilities.

25:56.446 --> 26:01.012
And so, he said, will you take him around?

26:01.072 --> 26:01.693
I said, sure.

26:01.813 --> 26:12.889
And so, I picked up Sidney Fox from Menstellar Polytechnic Institute.

26:14.451 --> 26:15.813
I had never heard of the man.

26:18.416 --> 26:24.765
And as we walked around, it was very, I wasn't sure what he was there for.

26:26.197 --> 26:34.509
But it was very obvious that he was exceedingly interested in laboratory facilities.

26:34.590 --> 26:50.213
And finally, in our discussions, he volunteered information that I was amazed to hear, that he had been offered the job of department head

26:52.252 --> 27:04.165
that it came with a $50,000 a year grant from the Welch Foundation and that half of his salary would be paid by the Welch Foundation.

27:04.926 --> 27:08.109
And that last statement rung a bell.

27:08.770 --> 27:12.534
I didn't like that at all.

27:12.554 --> 27:20.162
And so when he left, I circled around all the faculty members and asked him, do you know Sidney Fox?

27:20.242 --> 27:21.043
No one did.

27:22.019 --> 27:30.187
I don't remember what area he was in, but no one knew who Sidney Foxx was or how he had been picked.

27:30.588 --> 27:32.910
He had not been on our list.

27:32.930 --> 27:34.451
We know whose list he's on.

27:37.474 --> 27:41.639
Well, it turned out he was on Welch's list, I think.

27:42.079 --> 27:43.440
I can't prove that.

27:45.502 --> 27:48.145
I have some pretty good reason to believe it's cracked.

27:49.390 --> 28:15.702
Anyway, this really, really upset me, and so I wrote a letter and addressed it, copies all up the line to the, declared to Doc Daugherty, who was Chairman of the Board of Directors.

28:18.483 --> 28:25.809
I guess we simply asked, how had this man been chosen?

28:25.869 --> 28:31.955
Because no one in the chemistry department even knew him.

28:37.119 --> 28:48.169
And we said we were disturbed about some knowledge that we had picked up about this man and who had chosen him.

28:52.452 --> 29:01.165
And I had reason to believe that that letter, I wanted to get to Doc Daugherty.

29:04.831 --> 29:08.676
I had reason to believe it would never get to Doc Daugherty through channels.

29:09.658 --> 29:16.468
I sent copies to everyone and I told Fred Jensen what I was doing.

29:18.440 --> 29:23.004
And we simply asked the question, who's picked this man?

29:24.586 --> 29:34.856
We got word back from Dean Dalaplan a couple of days later that said, you people over there in the chemistry department don't worry about anything like this.

29:35.637 --> 29:41.462
The administration picks department heads and your wishes are being considered.

29:42.924 --> 29:46.287
In other words, shut down.

29:47.600 --> 29:55.254
And all but one other professor in the chemistry department signed this letter I wrote.

29:56.176 --> 29:57.799
I signed it first.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.843
Pretty obvious who wrote it, I think.

30:00.925 --> 30:08.079
Now, was that vice president for research... Andy Suttle?

30:08.379 --> 30:10.724
Did Andy Suttle have any part of that record?

30:10.864 --> 30:10.924
No.

30:11.292 --> 30:14.257
This was, Andy came along just a little after that.

30:14.437 --> 30:18.723
Andy came along about the time I was acting head.

30:19.805 --> 30:22.629
Tell you a story about Andy too.

30:22.730 --> 30:23.150
Go ahead.

30:23.270 --> 30:35.529
Anyway, I took this letter from Della playing around and I said I don't, they didn't answer a question.

30:36.170 --> 30:39.375
I thought we asked a perfectly reasonable question.

30:40.587 --> 30:51.019
And so I simply sat down and wrote another letter and simply said as kindly as I knew how to say it, we would appreciate an answer to our first question.

30:51.860 --> 30:53.061
You didn't answer it.

30:54.663 --> 30:56.385
We think we deserve an answer.

31:00.270 --> 31:06.797
And I again went by Fred Jensen's office about

31:08.903 --> 31:38.286
4 30 and showed him that letter and he begged me not to send it you're getting in big trouble and i said fred things i don't like what's happening and i respect your your feelings but i intend to send it so i walked right out of his office over to the academic building and dropped it in the post office over there and somebody from the president's office

31:38.266 --> 31:42.606
Pick that thing up within five minutes because...
