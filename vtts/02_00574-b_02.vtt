WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:05.152
find 90% of it noise. I don't mean literal noise, 
but I mean stuff you can't use. I lecture the same

00:10.197 --> 00:11.318
way. I never stick to the point. Well, is it 
rolling? It wouldn't be Pilgrimage. Not that I

00:20.246 --> 00:22.288
don't like the story. I do. But I'm ashamed of 
having written it. And the reason is that

00:26.712 --> 00:31.557
Pilgrimage is about my wife's hometown. 
Jefferson. And the image that comes out there and

00:34.106 --> 00:47.922
the satire, irony, whatever you want to call it, 
represents a view that I don't hold any longer. And

00:48.423 --> 00:56.453
I caused some unhappiness to people in Jefferson 
who read that story. I guess this is an age-old

00:56.493 --> 00:58.776
problem for a writer. But there were people that I 
liked. and people that I would not willingly have

01:01.000 --> 01:05.404
insulted for the world. And those people have 
always been very kind to me, so I do have this

01:06.505 --> 01:13.051
ambivalent feeling about it. I like this story, 
but in a way, I wish I'd never written it. And I

01:16.494 --> 01:22.560
didn't mean it quite as harshly as I think it came 
out in print. You know, I was having fun, and there

01:22.580 --> 01:27.184
are some funny things about Jefferson. But you get 
older, and you have children of your own, you get to

01:31.223 --> 01:44.157
the point where you catch yourself thinking, 
well, you know, if I had to pick a place where I'd

01:31.223 --> 01:44.157
like my kids to grow up, I could do a lot worse than 
Jefferson, and I'd feel rather more comfortable

01:31.223 --> 01:44.157
with them growing up there than here in Austin. So 
there's that. That doesn't answer your question.

01:49.363 --> 02:00.876
You like different stories for different 
reasons, and I suppose to some extent it depends on

01:49.363 --> 02:00.876
what day you catch a writer and which one you like. 
But I guess ones that more or less stick in my mind

02:02.071 --> 02:20.252
that I'm fond of, for one reason or another, would 
probably be Artifact, which is a long and short

02:02.071 --> 02:20.252
story, but it is technically a short story. And 
probably didn't he ramble. It's the jazz story, as

02:26.179 --> 02:30.103
far as short stories go. I don't know. You ask me 
tomorrow, I'm going to choose two of them. That's

02:35.148 --> 02:37.870
always a problem. I think a stick for Harry 
Eddington is a good story, too. But I don't know.

02:44.437 --> 02:48.161
It's very difficult to judge your own stuff. I've 
enjoyed most all of your things that have been said

02:48.181 --> 02:54.887
in Africa, or revolving in that area in 
particular. Thanks. And far from this earth,

02:55.688 --> 02:58.831
particularly like myself. Thank you. This is one 
of the top. I'm happy to hear it, not so much because

03:00.813 --> 03:08.843
it's set in Africa, but simply because it's one of 
my later things. You know, you like to think you're

03:08.863 --> 03:10.365
getting better. And I don't have anything like as 
much time to write as I wish I did, and I haven't been

03:11.647 --> 03:21.479
very prolific since I've been fouled up with being 
chairman. And hopefully all that's going to end

03:22.420 --> 03:25.464
soon and I can get back to it. But I think I've 
learned a few things. I hope I have. I know Dick

03:29.855 --> 03:33.600
Matheson always used to be terrible, you know. The 
first story he ever wrote was Born a Man and Woman,

03:33.940 --> 03:52.245
and apparently it's the only one anybody ever 
remembered, because whenever anybody would meet

03:33.940 --> 03:52.245
Dick, you know, they would say, oh, how I enjoyed 
Born a Man and Woman, and he's gotten to the point he

03:33.940 --> 03:52.245
just hates to hear about it, because, you know, the 
implication is that you haven't written a damn

03:33.940 --> 03:52.245
thing since that anybody wants to read. Yeah, 
that's true. I hate that. but I'd like to ask the

03:56.770 --> 04:02.975
same question about your noveling. Novel or 
novelette? Novel. Noveling really is... You're

04:05.698 --> 04:10.422
going to say artifying boarded right into the 
novelette category. It does shade into it. Well,

04:13.004 --> 04:15.086
it wouldn't be my favorite novelette. I was 
counting it as a short story. I don't know what my

04:17.408 --> 04:19.130
favorite novel is. I've written, I guess, more 
novelettes than short stories. Favorite

04:24.234 --> 04:25.275
novel... There's not a whole lot of room for choice 
here. Like liquid bibliography?

04:35.032 --> 04:40.439
Well, I suppose you can kind of tackle it in 
reverse.

04:43.583 --> 04:49.391
I like Unearthly Neighbors least of my own novels. 
That's not my title, by the way. I hate the title.

04:52.174 --> 04:54.958
Maybe that is one thing that puts me off. I called 
that Shoulder of the Sky. It's from Hausman. And it

04:59.876 --> 05:07.165
got changed because some guy had written a book 
about the Air Force that came out right about the

04:59.876 --> 05:07.165
same time called Shoulder of the Sky. So Valentine 
just stuck Unearthly Neighbors on it, which I

05:07.205 --> 05:13.433
think is just a ghastly title. If you'll notice, if 
my memory's not playing tricks on me, Unearthly

05:13.453 --> 05:22.465
Neighbors is the only one of my novels, science 
fiction novels, that's not very solidly rooted in

05:23.052 --> 05:25.636
the present. I'm not sure how much I've done this as 
a conscious policy, or whether it's just worked

05:26.898 --> 05:33.608
out that way. But all others have been. They're 
either set in the present, or they begin in the

05:36.893 --> 05:43.442
present, or they touch the present pretty closely 
one way or another. And this is not true of

05:44.564 --> 05:47.048
unearthly neighbors. And I suspect that's one 
reason I'm less fond of it. It's harder for me to get

05:51.200 --> 05:57.045
a degree of reality into a story. If I don't have a 
touchstone, I don't know quite how, I don't even

05:57.726 --> 06:15.562
know what I'm trying to say exactly, except that I 
like science fiction that's not too far out and

05:57.726 --> 06:15.562
that has something that's recognizable, not just 
to other people, but to me. So the thing is meaning,

06:16.002 --> 06:19.485
but anyway, I like that one the least. I think that 
you can eliminate Miss Sedan simply because it's a

06:20.545 --> 06:25.770
juvenile. I had some fun with that, by the way. They 
had a directive when I wrote that. Forgive me, am I

06:30.435 --> 06:33.478
going on too long about something you don't give a 
damn about? I remember there was kind of a formula

06:34.499 --> 06:41.966
you were supposed to write that book to for that 
whole series. Every chapter was supposed to end on

06:41.986 --> 06:48.392
a shattering climax, you know, that would make Joe 
Blow age 14, rip on through the know, and I

06:49.081 --> 06:53.611
compromised. And if you'll notice in Miss Adonna, 
not consistent, but frequently, I alternate

06:54.232 --> 07:03.793
chapters in which there's one chapter that's all 
plot and cliffhangers, and then there's one for

06:54.232 --> 07:03.793
me. And so more or less... Every other chapter in 
there is one that I wrote because I wanted to write

07:06.479 --> 07:12.186
it, and the next one is there for the story. But we 
could eliminate that one. You know, pretty soon

07:15.591 --> 07:19.456
we'll be down where there aren't any. I think The 
Winds of Time is a mixed bag in that there's some

07:19.476 --> 07:31.571
things I like very much in The Winds of Time, and 
there are other things that I don't care for too

07:19.476 --> 07:31.571
much. So we can eliminate that one. And that leaves 
us with, what, three?

07:41.255 --> 07:43.678
I don't know.

07:46.041 --> 07:57.357
I guess I like Shadows in the Sun, but saying that, 
what it really means is that it's somewhat closer

07:46.041 --> 07:57.357
to me than the others. I have not gone back and 
re-read it. I'm sure that if I went back and re-read

07:59.079 --> 08:03.165
it, there are lots of things I wouldn't care for 
about it. But I like the wolf as my brother, and I

08:03.922 --> 08:07.808
like the shores of another city. So I don't know. If 
I were forced to pick, I guess it would be between

08:10.853 --> 08:19.507
shadows in the sun and the wolf as my brother. But I 
don't know. One was your first venture in the

08:19.888 --> 08:23.073
general market, and the other one the prize 
market. That's right. Not that winning prizes

08:25.056 --> 08:26.819
says anything. Worked a long time on that book. I 
know which of the two is Dr. McAllister's

08:31.158 --> 08:35.982
favorite.

08:38.664 --> 08:42.568
I started writing Wolf is My Brother before I left 
for Africa. And I wrote a fair amount of it in Africa

08:44.249 --> 08:53.317
in the evenings, and sometimes when it was raining 
so hard I couldn't get out. You may remember it from

08:53.537 --> 08:55.319
the shores of another ship. I sometimes think my 
Comanches sound more like convo than anything

08:56.300 --> 09:00.203
else. I did, I spent a good five years on it. And I 
spent a good three years on Shores of Another Sea. I

09:09.949 --> 09:19.341
don't mean constantly, but I mean that's what I was 
working on and what you're, what finally came out

09:09.949 --> 09:19.341
is radically different from what I started with. 
Started out as a straight and all. Dr.

09:23.526 --> 09:30.915
McAllister told me the story that His copy of The 
Wolf is My Brother just suddenly appeared on his

09:32.498 --> 09:37.044
doorstep, so to speak. He was unaware that it was in 
progress. He'd been chastising you for years to

09:42.311 --> 09:47.738
get away from that silly science fiction and write 
something serious. Well, I don't recall that

09:48.319 --> 09:52.224
specifically. I remember talking about the 
science fiction. Everybody does. What do you

09:56.109 --> 09:57.832
waste your time writing that stuff? I get that all 
the time. It doesn't deter me in the least. But

10:02.350 --> 10:07.916
I never talk about things when I write them.

10:11.060 --> 10:16.105
I realize this sounds terribly superior and smug 
and all that. Forgive me, I don't mean to sound that

10:16.125 --> 10:18.208
way. In my experience, there are two kinds of 
writers, maybe three kinds. But broadly

10:22.693 --> 10:26.777
speaking, you've got the talking writers and the 
writing writers. And in my experience, the guys

10:27.979 --> 10:31.142
that spend all their time talking about what 
they're going to do and what they're doing, very

10:31.527 --> 10:35.453
seldom write anything. And I find it very hard. It 
goes dead on me if I talk about it when I'm doing it.

10:43.525 --> 10:55.303
Because whatever it is that you're trying to get 
down on a piece of paper and it makes you want to

10:43.525 --> 10:55.303
write the thing in the first place, it can get 
dissipated in telling somebody about it. I mean,

10:55.504 --> 10:57.827
after all, that's what you're doing when you're 
writing the story. But I never talk about it. And I

10:59.860 --> 11:07.688
very seldom talk about anything I've written 
either, unless somebody comes in and asks me

10:59.860 --> 11:07.688
point-blank. It's not that I'm secretive. On the 
other hand, I have known writers. Chuck Beaumont

11:11.252 --> 11:16.017
was one, who was always full of what he was writing 
right then. And I had to talk about it, and couldn't

11:16.658 --> 11:23.866
wait to rip a page out of the typewriter and read it 
to you, you know, whether the thing was finished or

11:16.658 --> 11:23.866
not. I've just never been... Yes. The 
collaborations with him carry this tone with

11:29.208 --> 11:33.494
them, I think. We had more fun doing those stories 
than anything I've ever written. I've never been

11:38.821 --> 11:41.425
able to collaborate really with anybody else. 
There was a story that came out with my byline and

11:43.047 --> 11:47.113
Garvin Berry's on it. You may have noticed a very 
early story in Super Science called The Blood

11:47.133 --> 11:53.442
Star, not my title either, and not Garvin's. But he 
didn't write it. What had happened there was we'd

11:56.321 --> 12:02.210
kicked it around together for a long time, and part 
of the plot was his. And I thought it was only fair to

12:02.230 --> 12:08.979
stick his name on it, but actually Chuck's the only 
one I've collaborated with. And just on that one

12:08.999 --> 12:15.008
kind of story, and we just had a ball. Everything he 
wrote just knocked me out. And we did it in

12:18.192 --> 12:20.516
sections, you know. He would sit down and write 
thousand words, you know, and give it to me, and

12:23.138 --> 12:28.666
then I'd read that and I'd type the next thousand. 
And he really broke me up. I can remember both of

12:30.008 --> 12:30.829
them. We just, it was one of those happy things 
where we each amused the other. And I remember

12:35.175 --> 12:44.388
taking his section of manuscript and reading it 
and actually falling out of the chair laughing,

12:35.175 --> 12:44.388
you know, and then going down and trying to do 
likewise. It was great fun. There's one other of

12:46.271 --> 12:52.499
those stories that we wrote that was never 
published, and I don't know what happened to it. I

12:52.700 --> 12:52.960
don't know. It got lost somewhere when Chuck died. 
It was called The Rest of Science Fiction. And we

12:59.517 --> 13:06.247
took all the plots that we hadn't been able to 
dispose of in the last word and I clubbed and took

12:59.517 --> 13:06.247
care of the rest of them. I remember nothing about 
it except a lot of it was horror fiction. And I

13:10.894 --> 13:16.382
remember the protagonist was the, let's see, how 
did that go? It was the beautiful scientist and his

13:17.223 --> 13:24.575
mad daughter, which we thought was a fairly good 
switch. But that's all I remember. It was great

13:29.242 --> 13:30.504
fun. I miss Chuck terribly. He was a wonderful guy. 
Met a terrible death. I thought, one of these awful

13:38.457 --> 13:44.867
things where you talk about a man getting trapped 
in his own plot, rather like a Lovecraftian sort of

13:46.467 --> 13:49.611
notion. I can never remember the name of the 
disease, but Chuck was the same age I am. It's this

13:56.121 --> 14:00.206
premature aging and senility syndrome, whatever 
it is. I forget the last time I saw Chuck before he

14:00.347 --> 14:04.132
died. His hair had turned snow white. His face was 
all lime. His hands were palsied. He could feel it

14:10.121 --> 14:11.422
coming on. Toward the end, he was just a vegetable. 
He couldn't even say yes or no. Perfectly harmless

14:15.998 --> 14:23.788
and kind of being a wonderful talented guy. I could 
tell you lots of stories about Beaumont, but I

14:23.808 --> 14:27.813
guess that's not what you want. Wasn't his real 
name anyway. Seems to be fairly common. But Chad

14:34.021 --> 14:35.542
Oliver's mother. Yeah. His real name was Nutt, 
Charles Nutt, N-U-T-T.

14:45.074 --> 14:52.004
It's very indicative of the kind of guy he was that 
he would pick a name like Beaumont. He was, even

14:52.024 --> 15:02.540
when he was desperately poor, he was very 
flamboyant, you know, only had one decent suit of

14:52.024 --> 15:02.540
clothes to his name, but it had a flashy red vest. 
And when he really got hungry, he used to go down,

15:03.541 --> 15:10.812
you know, not to some hamburger joint or anything, 
he'd pick out the finest restaurant in Los

15:03.541 --> 15:10.812
Angeles. demand to see the manager and say, sir, I 
am Charles Beaumont, struggling young writer. If

15:16.861 --> 15:19.684
you stake me to a meal one day, you will be famous. 
And he was never turned down. I wonder if he could

15:24.208 --> 15:26.169
get away with it now. I don't want to be curious. But 
he sure got away with it. It was a long time

15:33.376 --> 15:37.260
ago. Give me another question. I'm running now. 
Were there any other writers, I assume that

15:40.289 --> 15:48.322
Beaumont and Nolan both you met, first met while 
you were out on the coast? That's right. Are there

15:49.484 --> 15:53.731
any other writers or science fiction 
personalities with whom you got acquainted out

15:49.484 --> 15:53.731
there? Yeah, I knew Richard Matheson quite well.

16:01.964 --> 16:06.972
Dick and I had never met and we were both writing for 
fantasy and science fiction, carrying him side by

16:07.407 --> 16:11.192
side. And at that time, as I said, I didn't know 
Dick, and had no idea that he never read science

16:12.333 --> 16:19.722
fiction, didn't care anything about it. So I read a 
story of his that really impressed me, and I

16:19.782 --> 16:25.289
thought, well, gosh, here's this guy right here in 
Los Angeles. I'll just call him up. And I did. Got

16:29.954 --> 16:32.598
him on the phone, and I said, hi, Dick, this is Chad 
Oliver. It was this long silence, and then the

16:32.958 --> 16:36.182
single word He had never heard of me. He had no idea 
who I was. So I went over and explained who I was and

16:45.314 --> 16:49.958
we got to be very close friends. Apart from those, 
from Dick and Chuck and Bill, the only other ones

16:50.819 --> 16:59.568
were Bradbury, whom I knew fairly well. We 
certainly were never as close as Chuck and I and

16:59.588 --> 17:08.177
Bill, who were all more or less struggling 
M-Riders at a time that Bradbury had already

16:59.588 --> 17:08.177
arrived. tended to be rather paternal in his 
attitude toward young upstarts, which is not a

17:08.647 --> 17:15.094
fair statement. He's a very generous kind of a guy. 
And I knew Van Boot and some of the old timers out

17:18.517 --> 17:25.584
there like Ross Rocklin, Stu Byrne. They were all 
over the place, but I didn't know them well. And

17:29.768 --> 17:36.375
aside from those, actually the only writers that I 
know at all well are Walt Miller and and Randall

17:36.845 --> 17:41.933
Garrett, who spent a year

17:36.845 --> 17:41.933
here. There are others that I know casually, but 
not that I've ever spent a lot of time with. You're

17:46.279 --> 17:48.402
still a member of SFWA. Whether or not you're very 
active, I don't know. But I see you mentioned in

17:51.427 --> 17:58.597
connection with any membership work that they're 
doing. We can't keep people like Chad Oliver out.

18:01.422 --> 18:02.363
That's right. Where did you see that, or did you? I 
picked this up, I can't cite the source right off

18:04.912 --> 18:10.819
the top of my head, perhaps the last bulletin. 
Gosh, I must have missed that one. This is just a

18:13.182 --> 18:22.253
guess, but they were talking about someone had to 
publish within the last, in X number of years,

18:13.182 --> 18:22.253
which you're going to qualify now. Yeah, I'm 
qualified. Thank you. I hadn't published

18:24.555 --> 18:26.478
anything in several years. Yeah, I've been a 
member, and have not at all been active. It really

18:31.442 --> 18:33.404
boils down to paying my dues. They asked me to run 
for president several years ago when I declined.

18:38.290 --> 18:41.754
There's just no way in the world that I could be 
president. I mean, not that I'd get elected, but

18:41.874 --> 18:48.082
even if I did, at the same time that I'm chairman, 
it's just been awesome. I can understand that.

18:51.306 --> 18:52.547
But, yeah, I'm a member. Seems like a good 
organization. Yeah, if it doesn't... come apart

18:58.469 --> 19:07.042
at the seams with factionalism and a lot of 
quarreling about things that aren't really

18:58.469 --> 19:07.042
important. There is a danger in that. There isn't 
any organization of that type, but on balance,

19:09.525 --> 19:15.735
yeah, I think it's good. There's a new one which you 
may not have come across yet. The Science Fiction

19:18.398 --> 19:22.404
Research Association has been formed. Yes, I 
have. heard something about it, and somebody sent

19:25.537 --> 19:28.900
me some material on it. Because I recall that's the 
one that cost some astronomical sum to join here.

19:32.744 --> 19:33.324
Three bucks? Twenty bucks. Twenty bucks. Which, 
the last information I had, at least, indicates an

19:36.167 --> 19:52.963
interest in science fiction on what you might term 
the scholarly level, which again seems to be a...

19:52.983 --> 19:54.244
I'm also a member of a... Western Writers of 
America for what that's worth. Rather more of an

19:57.623 --> 20:02.771
organization I fear.

20:02.891 --> 20:04.874
I'm not an organization man. I don't join things. I 
don't like meetings and I hate conventions. I'm

20:09.281 --> 20:16.012
one of these odd people where if I ever do get some 
spare time I'm down on the stream trout fishing.

20:16.232 --> 20:19.978
These organizations indicate an academic 
interest in science fiction. Do you think this is

20:23.700 --> 20:26.003
good for the field? I'd be real curious.

20:30.087 --> 20:32.730
I'm not sure what you mean by good for the field. 
What I really think is that it's inevitable

20:33.110 --> 20:39.837
in lots of ways. If

20:40.057 --> 20:45.443
only on one elementary level. I've always felt in 
my prejudiced manner that for a fairly

20:51.650 --> 21:04.208
specialized, even coterie type of writing, a lot 
better writing in science fiction than in almost

20:51.650 --> 21:04.208
any other comparable field that I know anything 
about. And that's been true for many, many years.

21:07.212 --> 21:18.248
And the utter contempt with which it was received 
by outside critics, I don't know how much effect it

21:07.212 --> 21:18.248
had on the field, but it certainly hurts if you're a 
writer. to always have what you write simply

21:18.616 --> 21:23.483
ignored or, well, usually ignored. It wasn't that 
it was condemned, really, or torn apart by some

21:23.523 --> 21:28.390
savage critic. It's just as though it didn't 
exist. And there was a lot of writing in that period

21:31.133 --> 21:37.422
when we were being consistently ignored by 
everybody. It was a damn sight better than the kind

21:38.203 --> 21:42.029
of thing that everybody was flipping over. And I 
think it's still true. There's a definite

21:44.552 --> 21:46.615
tendency in this culture Films, books, 
everything. There's a sort of masterpiece of the

21:48.690 --> 22:01.790
week club in which I've gotten to the point I never 
go see a film anymore where somebody has found some

21:48.690 --> 22:01.790
review that says, this will revolutionize motion 
pictures. It's the greatest film in the last five

22:01.810 --> 22:03.733
years. It's always crap. And the same way with the 
novels and the novelists who are the darlings of

22:05.756 --> 22:13.328
the critics for six months or something and you 
never hear of them again. There were lots of things

22:14.017 --> 22:18.904
that were being done that should have received 
more attention than they did. But how much effect

22:20.887 --> 22:25.875
it actually has on the writing of science fiction 
is something else. I think you could even argue it

22:25.975 --> 22:27.878
the other way. That maybe there was an advantage in 
writers writing science fiction because they

22:28.780 --> 22:40.277
loved it and simply tried to do the best job they 
could without worrying about what some critic was

22:28.780 --> 22:40.277
going to say. There's always a danger in writing 
for the critic, any critic. It's the worst mistake

22:44.373 --> 22:47.356
you can make. You've no doubt read the SFWA 
round-robin criticism. Who needs it? I've

22:52.903 --> 22:54.524
thumbed through it. I think this was the genesis of 
the question. People don't understand science

22:59.170 --> 23:02.133
fiction. They still don't understand science 
fiction. Most criticism of science fiction, I

23:05.197 --> 23:10.062
think, has the wrong target anyhow. So much of it, 
you know, come back to what you're talking about in

23:10.717 --> 23:15.323
the article you're writing. The idea is that the 
one form of science fiction that's respectable is

23:16.184 --> 23:27.898
some variant of the utopian novel, the social 
satire, or something of that kind. And in large

23:28.919 --> 23:37.990
part, this is purely a personal crotchet of mine, 
but it's the aspect of science fiction that

23:28.919 --> 23:37.990
interests me the least. other types of science 
fiction that are aimed at a different target don't

23:38.392 --> 23:50.151
get the same reception, whether you're talking 
about Childhood's End or More Than Human or

23:38.392 --> 23:50.151
Mechanical for Leibowitz or whoever. Science 
fiction, you know, it's essentially a literary

23:50.171 --> 23:55.039
technique. What it is, it's a way of telling a 
story. And you can write any kind of story as

23:58.064 --> 24:03.353
science fiction, I think.

24:08.800 --> 24:22.675
Joanna Russ, I believe, I hate to cite her 
specifically, but I've seen a lot of big-name

24:08.800 --> 24:22.675
science fiction people mention about the 
academic interest in science fiction. By and

24:22.775 --> 24:28.521
large, what it is, do those academics keep their 
hands the hell out of our literature? This is the

24:29.081 --> 24:31.824
genesis of the question and what was behind it. 
Well, I wouldn't agree with that. As I say, I think

24:34.167 --> 24:36.749
it's inevitable. I mean, here it is. If it exists, 
it ought to be studied, and what harm can it do? As

24:43.592 --> 24:45.454
long as we don't take it too seriously. That's the 
danger.

24:49.299 --> 24:53.924
I believe you have written an article on the nature 
of science fiction that appeared in one of the

24:49.299 --> 24:53.924
fanzines.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.031
Inside an SF advertiser sometime in 1955. Oh gosh, 
I'd forgotten about that. What is science

25:02.033 --> 25:03.495
fiction? Yeah, I did. It was a long time. I'm sorry I 
don't remember a thing about it. I'll try to get my

25:08.320 --> 25:09.922
hands on it. I dimly recall writing it, and I hadn't 
thought about it in years. Yeah, I did. You're

25:14.327 --> 25:15.668
right. What about, did you write much for the 
fanzines? No. On that nature? No. There were a few

25:20.454 --> 25:23.857
things, and that was some I've forgotten.

25:26.460 --> 25:30.765
I wrote a thing, I remember, on Ray Bradbury for 
that book. What was it called? It was a one-shot,

25:33.443 --> 25:45.682
finely done thing called the Ray Bradbury Review 
or something that Bill Mullen put out years ago and

25:33.443 --> 25:45.682
asked me to write an article for, which I did. And 
then I did that thing that you mentioned, and there

25:45.942 --> 25:52.172
are probably a few others, but I don't remember 
what they were. I've never been much involved with

25:53.154 --> 25:56.719
the fan magazines, really. except for publishing 
my own one time. A one-shot. Garvin Berry and I put

26:02.764 --> 26:05.168
out one called The Moon Puddle. One issue. The Moon 
Puddle.

26:13.239 --> 26:17.145
Variant of The Moon Puddle by A. Murray. We had a lot 
of fun with it, but we never really intended it to be

26:17.626 --> 26:21.651
a series or anything. We just ran all 50 copies, 
which are priceless collector's items. Dr.

26:26.618 --> 26:27.739
Manick has got. I don't know where my copy is. We 
wrote the whole thing. Well, I take it back. We

26:33.405 --> 26:45.118
wrote all of it except one article that David H. 
Keller submitted at that period where he was

26:33.405 --> 26:45.118
submitting everything to all of them. I had an 
article in there about Edgar Rice Burroughs and

26:45.779 --> 26:56.490
Garvin had a perfectly marvelous thing on Henry 
Kuttner in which he set out to try to track down

26:45.779 --> 26:56.490
every pen name that Henry Kuttner ever used, which 
was an Olympian undertaking. I knew Kuttner also,

27:02.978 --> 27:04.780
I forgot. Fascinating kid. You never did write any 
pseudonym, did you? Did you always use your own

27:09.746 --> 27:13.630
name? Does that tell me the question? No, I was just 
trying to remember if I ever had. I don't think so.

27:23.882 --> 27:25.043
If I did, I don't recall. never had any reason. I 
mean, after all, I'm not that prolific. That's

27:32.105 --> 27:35.751
primary reason for the pseudonyms at that point. 
It was in the old days, where it just looked awkward

27:35.871 --> 27:46.547
to have a contents page that had been entirely 
written by one individual, although sometimes

27:35.871 --> 27:46.547
they did that, you know, more or less as a gimmick. I 
remember, I think Don Wilcox wrote a whole issue of

27:46.567 --> 27:54.919
Amazing Stories one time, but it was done actually 
for two reasons. One, to avoid the argument, well

27:57.237 --> 27:59.980
he can't be any good if he writes that. And the other 
people who had radically different styles, and

28:01.101 --> 28:08.249
they wanted to keep them separate, and that 
definitely was a factor with Kuttner. He wrote

28:08.310 --> 28:12.174
totally differently as Henry Kuttner and as Lewis 
Padgett, for example. And for a long time, nobody

28:14.216 --> 28:18.841
knew who Lewis Padgett wrote. And then he and his 
wife, C.L. Moore, collaborated on a number of

28:20.503 --> 28:23.667
things and used some other name. What was that? 
Lawrence O'Donnell. I don't know what the name

28:27.832 --> 28:29.274
was. Whatever it was. But he had a whole raft of 
them. Keith Hammond was another one. A number of

28:34.622 --> 28:40.550
these people have unbelievable variety of 
suitors. The guy that amazes me is Paul Anderson.

28:45.577 --> 28:46.699
He is so prolific. And the quality is so high. And 
he's been doing it for so long. That is amazing.

28:54.009 --> 28:54.109
Yeah. There are lots of writers that have creative 
spurts and turn out a number of really fine things

28:54.730 --> 29:07.626
within a fairly short period of time and then more 
or less tail off and just dribble out a story.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.993
Ted Sturgeon, to a degree, is like that. He's 
written very little really lately, at least that

29:13.053 --> 29:16.077
I'm aware of. And these fantastic creative 
explosions like Heinlein had at one time, again

29:17.078 --> 29:24.147
under a variety of different managers. But 
somebody that can sustain it over the years, like

29:24.785 --> 29:30.453
Pohl does, is really amazing. I knew him, too. I 
forgot. Not

29:32.396 --> 29:35.801
well. Pohl lived in Berkeley. And several times 
when I went up to talk to Boucher, I'd get together

29:37.664 --> 29:46.176
with Pohl or Meyer very much, which is probably 
obvious. I enjoy reading much of his material.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.986
I've got a new to me paperback that he's written. 
Yeah, it's the kind of thing where there are not too

29:53.303 --> 30:00.412
many Paul Anderson stories that you can look back 
on and say, boy, that's the greatest thing I ever

29:53.303 --> 30:00.412
read. But on the other hand, there are very few 
you'll ever read that you put down and say, boy,

30:01.813 --> 30:08.762
that's a total waste of time, a real stinker. He's a 
real pro, is what they've done. That's true, too. I

30:14.509 --> 30:15.390
have a curiosity. Have you read Heinlein's new 
contribution? No. I saw it. in the serial version

30:21.670 --> 30:24.193
in what, Galaxy? I read something about it 
somewhere, just one comment that I have not read.

30:29.979 --> 30:33.363
In fact, I haven't read a fair amount of it over the 
later Heinlein. I'm ashamed to say I've read

30:33.383 --> 30:39.470
Stranger in a Strange Land and I've read The Moon is 
a Harsh Mistress. And I think that's about all

30:40.651 --> 30:44.436
fairly recent. I guess it's not really recent to 
you, Heinlein. So isn't this the one about the sex

30:49.092 --> 30:55.061
switch? It's a brain transplant, basically what 
it is. Coupled with a sex switch, I guess you could

30:59.608 --> 31:03.013
say. Getting good. I wouldn't read it again if I had 
my choice. It has received uniformly poor

31:08.942 --> 31:11.306
reviews. Well, maybe there's something to it. 
It's an interesting thing. I think he was going

31:19.045 --> 31:23.130
around experimenting a bit himself. Well, 
there's a guy who I think contributed a tremendous

31:23.150 --> 31:35.643
amount to science fiction, particularly in terms 
of technique. During that one period where

31:35.663 --> 31:46.555
Heinlein was really turning them out, both as 
Heinlein and as Anson MacDonald, I think it would

31:35.663 --> 31:46.555
be very hard to point to any comparable what was it, 
three-year period by any one writer in which so

31:47.159 --> 31:51.837
many knew.
