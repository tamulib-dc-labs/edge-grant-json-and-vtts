WEBVTT

00:04.115 --> 00:05.597
I mentioned Gwen Flint. Gwen was from the previous 
year, and Gwen went on to law school, has done well,

00:05.617 --> 00:15.571
raised a family, good attorney. Jeff Dunn then 
followed Steve. Jeff was Jewish, and Jeff went to

00:18.135 --> 00:28.169
law school, has done well, is an attorney up in the 
Dallas area. Let's digress a second. Did you

00:30.232 --> 00:32.215
encounter any incidents, particularly in those 
years, but in general, that had to do with somebody

00:33.089 --> 00:41.960
being Jewish or Catholic or nothing or whatever? 
No, and the reason I slid into Jeff is I wanted to

00:43.141 --> 00:51.191
capture one more and then relate to the previous 
four. And Fred McClure was after Jeff Dunham. So we

00:54.555 --> 00:59.721
went from a Jewish youngster to a black youngster.

01:01.844 --> 01:13.868
And to tie that, Jeff and Steve were roommates in 
Houston when Steve had the heart attack. And at the

01:13.888 --> 01:24.308
funeral in New Braunfels, after Steve died, Jeff 
helped the family set up services So we had a Jewish

01:24.507 --> 01:36.198
kid, and Steve was in a church of Christ, and Fred 
sang Amazing Grace at the funeral in the choir

01:24.507 --> 01:36.198
loft.

01:37.139 --> 01:41.983
And so I think it was typical of what A&M was all 
about. A mixture of people, conservative values,

01:42.564 --> 01:48.650
and good human beings. Do you agree with me? I've 
always generalized that The major criteria in

01:53.093 --> 01:59.082
here is, are you an Aggie or not? If you are, then 
whether you're left-handed, tall, short,

01:59.102 --> 02:08.535
Jewish, Irish, doesn't, that's coincidental. 
One thing about Jeff, at my dinners I used to always

02:08.555 --> 02:17.768
say a Catholic blessing, and so Jeff got all over 
me, the Jewish dude. I said things that sort of

02:18.001 --> 02:24.649
offended the Jewish people. And I said, Jeff, 
that's fine. I said, when you pay for the dinner,

02:26.431 --> 02:30.457
then you can start saying the Jewish blessing. But 
I did amend the blessing to not offend. It was

02:35.303 --> 02:36.864
something of which I was unaware. But they were all 
good kids. In regard to the core,

02:40.209 --> 02:47.738
we had some good kids that... We had Scott Everhart 
that first year as Corps Commander

02:48.612 --> 02:58.161
along with Randy. We had one young man who served as 
Vice President for Student Government and Vice

02:58.181 --> 03:05.388
President of the MSC. He's the only one that's ever 
done that. He's an attorney now and I'm trying to

03:10.112 --> 03:16.138
grab his name, David. His dad was an architect from 
Fort Worth, a very prominent former student. He

03:23.726 --> 03:26.110
died of a heart attack in Cali. I can't think of his 
last name. Was Barbara Sears the first female

03:28.953 --> 03:33.599
student body officer? Yeah. Barbara and Steve 
went together for a long time and then even after

03:41.313 --> 03:48.944
they left here, and then Barb went to Duke, and she 
stayed in touch with us, and her Steve went to

03:41.313 --> 03:48.944
Hollywood. Barb got a doctoral degree, and I'm 
thinking it's in,

03:49.465 --> 03:59.400
I think biochemistry. She's on the faculty now at 
Michigan to study, and her specialty was

04:15.113 --> 04:21.165
I was going to say genealogy, but it's not 
genealogy. What do they call it? Do you remember

04:23.189 --> 04:37.476
any pluses or minuses of a female running for 
student body office and winning?

04:37.827 --> 04:40.550
I think the students slid into them very easily. At 
A&M it really was. For example, you were talking

04:43.753 --> 04:50.019
about being left-handed or right-handed or black 
or white or Jewish or whatever. If you were

04:50.039 --> 04:53.463
capable, you were selected or elected. And if you 
weren't, you were not. With one exception, and we

04:55.805 --> 05:05.995
talked about that, it's related to Ross, Sol Ross 
in the Corps. They weren't. interested in

05:06.903 --> 05:14.314
selecting women initially for that group.

05:14.795 --> 05:22.005
I think had it been allowed to run its course, it 
would have happened. And they would have selected

05:22.025 --> 05:29.817
or elected women into that organization just like 
they did in student government and other things.

05:29.837 --> 05:36.066
The one I've told on Barbara Sears is her standing 
on the steps of the Cushing Library where the

05:36.316 --> 05:51.544
voting booths were on the inside, having worked 
carefully on her eye makeup that day and her hair in

05:36.316 --> 05:51.544
a pretty dress, giving out cards with her name on 
it, and then saying softly as they accepted the

05:36.316 --> 05:51.544
card, would you vote for me? And she admitted to me, 
yes, that's what she did do.

06:00.430 --> 06:11.145
Do you remember any particular student 
leadership campaigns for certain major items,

06:00.430 --> 06:11.145
issues, during those early years? No, I think the 
things that they argued about are those that they

06:13.388 --> 06:21.139
still argue about. they will say to some degree 
before they get involved in those offices that the

06:21.794 --> 06:32.451
administration doesn't listen to the students 
and so on. And once they get involved, they find out

06:32.471 --> 06:40.984
that they do and they are heard, they are listened

06:32.471 --> 06:40.984
to. I was reading battalions the other day, it was 
the same thing as related to some elections. No, I

06:47.914 --> 06:50.198
don't think, no. Not anything major. It's always 
been, well,

06:52.926 --> 07:07.482
I do remember one early on that was funny, 
humorous, but it had to do with the fences around

06:52.926 --> 07:07.482
the campus. I don't know if you remember that. The 
students were upset that they were going to put

07:10.966 --> 07:19.695
fences around and kind of create a prison-like 
environment with the fences. So there were things

07:23.642 --> 07:26.607
like that that came up. So they were interesting 
and more fun than they were really serious and a

07:26.627 --> 07:33.658
major problem. Since I'm going to talk to Fred 
McClure tomorrow, do you recall any specific

07:34.379 --> 07:46.257
events, plus or minus, during his year as student 
body president? Fred had a good year. The thing I

07:49.737 --> 08:00.114
remember the most was about Fred was in spring 
convocation when he was late getting back. He was

08:00.134 --> 08:04.701
out on the west coast someplace and had to hustle to 
get back. And he talked like a Baptist minister,

08:05.390 --> 08:10.898
even as a young student body president. And his 
presence at that spring convocation as a young

08:11.599 --> 08:27.522
student, I thought was very well with all the 
higher ups administratively and academically.

08:27.542 --> 08:30.346
And he could hold his own already. Because if I'm 
not mistaken, that was centennial year. and we had

08:35.309 --> 08:59.730
all been thinking about that as the kind of 
culmination of dr williams's and then the heart

08:35.309 --> 08:59.730
attack took him away from that um the i was the 
master of ceremonies

08:35.309 --> 08:59.730
i was looking at some stuff the other day that had 
kind of slipped away then back at the inauguration

09:00.554 --> 09:06.362
Kent Caperton spoke for the students, I spoke for 
the faculty at the Williams inauguration. So

09:06.422 --> 09:10.949
that, I remember that beginning. Other, do you 
remember any other centennial year events and

09:11.810 --> 09:16.357
highlights?

09:18.980 --> 09:22.505
I remember Ed Cooper was the one responsible for 
all of that. He did a good job of pulling everything

09:22.525 --> 09:29.295
together.

09:29.528 --> 09:34.916
other than the fact that everything went smooth 
and it was a nice time, enjoyable. I know a lot of

09:34.936 --> 09:39.403
work went in by the committee and all those who were 
involved with it. I really wasn't, you know,

09:39.423 --> 09:54.726
although I was master of ceremonies at that 
function,

09:39.423 --> 09:54.726
it just seemed like everything went smoothly and 
everything went well. Alright, let's kind of,

09:55.364 --> 10:08.375
let's see, in terms of Fred, I've told this one, you 
saw it get, after Fred left, and of course all my

09:55.364 --> 10:08.375
kids got to know Fred really well. They had him, we 
had him back for a commencement speech, and he flew

10:09.496 --> 10:24.409
in on a Friday, and I

10:09.496 --> 10:24.409
woke up on Saturday morning, getting ready to go to 
the commencement, and my son He was up and he came

10:24.608 --> 10:29.615
down to the kitchen and we were talking and he said, 
guess who was at the chicken with us last night? And

10:29.635 --> 10:31.397
I said, who? He said, Fred. I said, son of a gun. He 
said, well, Fred had come in and they had gotten a

10:35.082 --> 10:41.270
bunch of beer and everybody and they drank beer. 
And the next morning, we're waiting, Fred had

10:41.290 --> 10:46.617
come. The faculty has to get ready to move out. 
Fred's out there. Fred's out there. Just before we

10:51.507 --> 10:53.930
got ready to move out, do you remember? Fred? Oh, 
you weren't here, probably. No. Fred shows up. And

10:57.954 --> 11:03.900
so we, I'm laughing and teasing with him, didn't 
say anything about Jay at all. We went up on the

11:04.661 --> 11:06.943
stage all week. Fred made a speech. And boy, he did a 
good job. But he was just sweating. I mean, he was

11:13.430 --> 11:15.332
just pouring. And he came back, and he sat down. And 
I leaned over and I said, hey, everybody's

11:17.967 --> 11:23.894
thinking it's all that heat with those lights 
blaring on you. I know it's all that damn beer you

11:24.255 --> 11:28.840
drank last night. But Fred was good as gold.

11:37.871 --> 11:38.733
Fred had a good year. Those kids early on had good 
years. Steve had a good year. Jeff had a good year.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.422
Fred had a good year. Go ahead. I was going to say, 
let's kind of draw this to a conclusion. Do you

11:53.271 --> 12:02.444
remember any good funnies, any good laughs during 
those early years? Well, I mentioned about Dr.

12:02.465 --> 12:11.818
Williams hitting a golf ball, kicking me in the 
shin.

12:13.874 --> 12:14.775
Let's see, now wait. The golf ball. He told me one 
time, I asked him why did he play golf soon after the

12:18.098 --> 12:25.306
board would leave town. And he told me that because 
he could imagine that there were certain board

12:25.326 --> 12:32.193
members rumped on the golf ball.

12:35.276 --> 12:38.039
In fact, he would normally call that afternoon. 
That's right. And my secretary would know that

12:41.752 --> 12:49.602
when he called that we rescheduled everything, no 
matter who it was or whatever. Because I wanted him

12:50.023 --> 12:52.146
to, you know. When you all were playing golf, did he 
ever kind of unwind? He did, but not in regard to

12:57.613 --> 13:00.396
conversation. But that's what I mean. He didn't 
talk about things that were bothering him. I don't

13:04.261 --> 13:08.627
know that he did that with anyone unless it was Mrs. 
Williams. Yeah. I, of course, since he didn't do it

13:09.663 --> 13:17.755
with me, I assumed that he did it with John, but I 
never did ask John. If so, I'm not aware of it. Me,

13:19.718 --> 13:20.680
half. He just, he was not that tight. No. But, you 
know, just getting out in the fresh air and

13:24.245 --> 13:30.435
relaxing was the thing that got him away. He didn't 
have to, he didn't have to let go a whole lot.

13:35.443 --> 13:38.387
Alright, do you remember any goofy student 
pranks? Stunts. Goofs.

13:55.792 --> 13:56.794
To him or to me? No, anything. I was trying to think 
of some funnies, help you think of some funnies to

14:00.098 --> 14:06.265
conclude this section of the... Well,

14:08.540 --> 14:23.320
on election night the kids would come over to my 
house and wait for me at 5 30 in the morning as I came

14:08.540 --> 14:23.320
walking out. After counting the ballots, 
remember we used to have to count the ballots on the

14:24.001 --> 14:38.260
computer, and they knew that we'd go to breakfast 
together and so we used to do that. A cute thing,

14:38.746 --> 14:54.764
after one of the football games,

14:38.746 --> 14:54.764
we used to have everyone come by the house, all the 
friends and former students and so on at the house

14:38.746 --> 14:54.764
on campus. So after a football game, there would be 
loads and loads of people. And after this one

15:00.770 --> 15:03.693
football game, it was about midnight, and the 
doorbell rang. We had lots of people sitting

15:03.714 --> 15:05.616
around. I went to the door. young lady and young man 
standing at the door, and so I invited them in, two

15:10.353 --> 15:16.479
other students. They came over and, trying to get 
them to sit down, they couldn't sit down, they were

15:16.499 --> 15:22.646
very antsy, so I sat down. They got in front of me, 
and the young lady's father, she was from Fort

15:23.126 --> 15:35.179
Worth, had died a couple years before, and I had 
helped him through that when he had. And so the

15:36.138 --> 15:40.483
young man had asked her to marry him that evening. 
They wanted to share that with me, and she wanted to

15:40.503 --> 15:48.032
ask me if I would give her away at her wedding. So 
that was an interesting thing that happened. You

15:53.519 --> 15:58.605
know, Haskell, I'm sure there were loads and loads 
of funny things that happened. They just kind of

15:58.625 --> 16:02.990
slip away.

16:05.153 --> 16:06.094
I've got... a bunch of files and probably the next 
time before we sit down and talk, I'll just kind of

16:06.935 --> 16:14.685
go through and try to brief myself. Let's see, then 
I'll close with this one. I've been interviewing

16:20.834 --> 16:28.464
the past presidents of the Former Students 
Association. Somebody gave me, planted a

16:28.484 --> 16:33.471
question with me that I've asked them. I've asked 
them, Well, did they know anything about any

16:35.318 --> 16:42.545
secret fraternities while they were students? 
Almost all of them have said no. Are you at liberty

16:45.088 --> 16:49.912
to say anything about secret fraternities at A&M? 
I know they've existed. I know for a fact they've

16:52.195 --> 16:54.917
existed. Have they existed in your days at A&M? No. 
OK. And I would assume that they still exist.

17:05.137 --> 17:07.621
That's what I have surmised. And as far as I can 
determine from what I've learned from these few

17:09.043 --> 17:23.905
people who will admit they know something, that 
their primary purpose was to help get their own

17:09.043 --> 17:23.905
members in leadership positions.

17:28.572 --> 17:32.578
Well, that may be part of it. primarily related to 
the core. OK, yeah, yeah, yeah. And to get their

17:37.936 --> 17:47.367
people in the key core positions and or the key 
student body position.

17:48.088 --> 17:54.496
And I've heard references to two, the TTs and what 
was the other one? I can't remember. I can't

17:56.318 --> 17:59.201
remember what the other one was. Oh.

18:03.608 --> 18:29.459
And I want to run this one by Mr. Evans, because I 
heard that there was one that had a swastika as its

18:03.608 --> 18:29.459
logo way back in his day as a student, long before 
the Nazi party came into being, because that was

18:03.608 --> 18:29.459
the Navajo good luck sign.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.383
So let's see. All right, what day did y'all get to, 
when you moved here, what day was it when you

18:33.950 --> 18:39.965
arrived? 15th of August, 1970. And what was the 
climate like that day?

18:49.525 --> 18:51.467
It was a pretty day. The sun wasn't bothered by the 
heat, but we were coming from Commerce. It had been

18:57.473 --> 19:03.599
hot all summer there, so I'm assuming that 
temperature wise it was about the same. We moved

19:03.619 --> 19:14.130
into an apartment over on Harvey Road, a three 
bedroom apartment. The kids were real thrilled

19:14.150 --> 19:17.473
about us coming in. We gave the two oldest girls the 
master bedroom. And Mary Dallin and I took the

19:22.394 --> 19:26.678
smaller bedroom. And that was to pacify those two 
older girls. Because they were very unhappy with

19:30.802 --> 19:34.285
their daddy about taking this child. They were 13 
and 11. And they were already missing their

19:36.347 --> 19:40.431
friends. And of course, those two died in the real 
Aggies. Everything was changed. I was able to use

19:48.318 --> 20:01.275
that years later, my daddy making the decision 
sometimes when it doesn't seem like it's very good

19:48.318 --> 20:01.275
and sometimes it's in their own best interest. But 
yeah, and I'm, what's his name, home, Adam's, the

20:01.295 --> 20:05.741
one that moved us. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

20:05.761 --> 20:14.713
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

20:05.761 --> 20:14.713
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

20:05.761 --> 20:14.713
no, no, no, no, Who was that? Connolly. Yeah. 
Connolly brothers. Connolly moving and storage.

20:23.650 --> 20:24.511
Yeah, moving and storage. They moved us. Homer 
moved us on campus when we moved from the

20:26.313 --> 20:30.058
apartment. Well, I think he moved us from the 
apartment to the house on Guadalupe and then from

20:30.078 --> 20:38.269
Guadalupe out to the campus. You remember Homer, 
right? Oh, yes, yes. So you think that... That two

20:45.220 --> 20:55.295
minutes or so you spent with Dr. Williams early on, 
on that first interview visit, may have had a

20:45.220 --> 20:55.295
fairly important effect on your life.

21:02.946 --> 21:04.889
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, it did. I wasn't sure 
at the time what effect it had. Yes, it did.

21:27.435 --> 21:40.793
It was just an interesting period in regard to 
thinking that you're not being considered and

21:27.435 --> 21:40.793
you're just wasting his time when it really was not 
the way it was. Right, and now this will be the last

21:41.330 --> 21:43.914
question. What message would you like me to pass on 
to Margaret Williams? Oh, give her my love. Tell

21:52.026 --> 21:55.812
her I think of her often and very positively. It was 
good to see that the girls, and especially Mary,

22:00.331 --> 22:01.252
dedication. I got to know Mary real well. I didn't 
know her other daughter. And I was sorry that she

22:08.799 --> 22:14.185
wasn't, that Martin wasn't, to see her. They were 
very good to me, to us. And we missed them. We were

22:20.411 --> 22:22.673
sorry things went the way they went. And then our 
relationship

22:24.815 --> 22:30.000
didn't last for that long.
