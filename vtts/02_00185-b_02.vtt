WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:03.750
Going back. All right, but no one was in that fire. 
No one was injured. No, and we felt very fortunate

00:11.041 --> 00:13.545
there. If it hadn't happened in the daytime. But 
like my girls that were in their moo-moos, they put

00:16.689 --> 00:24.261
on the worst clothes that anybody could ever... I 
had to go shopping before they could go to church

00:24.281 --> 00:26.845
the next day. And you... then where did y'all live 
temporarily in the old board quarters that were

00:31.435 --> 00:52.735
just across the valley from sabisa old board house 
just yeah and mr peniston at the time he said you

00:31.435 --> 00:52.735
know i always thought that would be the first one to 
burn i said oh don't say that but we stayed there

00:31.435 --> 00:52.735
about three weeks and at that time in the board 
found out about the house that had belonged to Dean

00:53.795 --> 01:22.755
Brooks who had been dean of arts and sciences and 
he'd been long deceased and his widow was in

00:53.795 --> 01:22.755
terrible health and the doctors had her in the 
hospital and told her said they weren't going to

00:53.795 --> 01:22.755
release her until she agreed to either have 
somebody live with her or go live with somebody and

00:53.795 --> 01:22.755
see they had no children so she had a sister in 
Henderson that was in the same circumstance And so

01:23.647 --> 01:31.335
she went to live with her, and it was just most 
fortunate for us because we just walked in and

01:23.647 --> 01:31.335
everything was there. And where was this located? 
Oh, 115 Lee. Ah. Do you know where, oh, Ann Lou

01:35.259 --> 01:39.724
Jessup lives now? Right there at Southside. Yeah, 
just a half block off the George Bush Drive. Now,

01:44.829 --> 01:47.712
you lost almost all of your furniture. Oh, yes. And 
what I didn't lose went into storage. And Earl and I

01:53.110 --> 02:03.185
went around and put our name tag on things that were 
ours, because so many of the things that were

01:53.110 --> 02:03.185
brought up there for storage belonged to the 
university. So we put our name on things that

02:03.265 --> 02:05.107
belonged to us. And I had a nice piano, but it got 
kind of scorched a little bit because of having the

02:05.748 --> 02:12.638
grand piano downstairs that belonged to the 
university. Mine was up on the stair landing.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.355
I was in George Stewart's music company one day. He 
said, by the way, I've almost got that piano

02:22.096 --> 02:25.520
refinished that I bought from the university. I 
said, which one did you buy, George? He said,

02:27.221 --> 02:28.903
bought the one that was in the fire. I said, how'd 
you do that? That was mine. He said, well, they

02:32.207 --> 02:35.550
advertised it on the surface property sale. He 
said, I got it for $76. I said, oh, my word. It had

02:41.076 --> 02:42.998
been $1,050 at the time I bought it. But anyway, 
Earl would not get disturbed about small matters.

02:48.832 --> 02:55.940
And I told him, I said, Earl, they sold my piano for 
$76, and he almost had it refinished. Anyway, Earl

02:57.822 --> 03:01.366
said, well, tell them to give us the $76. I think 
they paid him $75, and we just wrote that up to a

03:02.528 --> 03:07.153
loss. All right, then the new house. Loved it. Who 
selected the location? I hate to say it, but Doris

03:15.443 --> 03:32.860
Hannigan and I, we walked the campus one day, and we 
decided it didn't need to be right down there in the

03:15.443 --> 03:32.860
middle of where all day and all night you heard 
footsteps, that if we put it out there, the

03:15.443 --> 03:32.860
direction facing it, it looked like it was out in 
the open. But really, Doris and I, but we didn't say

03:33.701 --> 03:36.864
anything. The board met, and it staked it out 
between where Malin Sutherland is and that

03:38.206 --> 03:45.433
corner. and they would have had to cut down a bunch 
of the big oak trees and it and it would look out into

03:45.599 --> 04:15.488
the look at the front door you'd look at the 
dormitories and at the back you look at something

03:45.599 --> 04:15.488
so I just kind of moaned and groaned about it they 
had a stake there but you know they left them there

03:45.599 --> 04:15.488
till the next meeting then they moved them I don't 
know I never did know what happened but they put it

03:45.599 --> 04:15.488
exactly where we thought it ought to go now I've 
heard that Mr. Rutter is the one that identified

04:16.042 --> 04:22.370
the exact way it would face. Somebody told me that 
he said, I want to be the first Aggie to see the

04:23.051 --> 04:26.696
sunrise. I don't know. But you know where he wanted 
to put that? Where? Back in Hensel Park, where it

04:30.480 --> 04:32.303
was hidden. I said, Earl, you know those Aggies. I 
said, they're going to want to come back to that

04:34.846 --> 04:38.531
campus and say, there's the president's house. 
No, he really did. He was serious about it. uh and uh

04:42.957 --> 05:06.973
let's see local architect did the yes dd matthews 
good aggie and then gene donahoe was a decorate and

04:42.957 --> 05:06.973
bob bernath oh people would not believe and and 
there's some difference opinion on this but i

04:42.957 --> 05:06.973
remember earl saying it was the best bargain the 
state of texas had but it cost the state because it

04:42.957 --> 05:06.973
cost the state sixty thousand So, and because, see 
the brick, I'm glad you asked. The brick that house

05:16.303 --> 05:26.932
is made from was old brick that was handmade in 
Hearn in the early, early 1890s, and they built the

05:16.303 --> 05:26.932
science hall from it. At the time the old house 
burned, they'd already decided to tear the

05:27.333 --> 05:33.438
science hall down and put another building there. 
So they just reserved enough of that brick to build

05:34.960 --> 05:38.783
the house. So that didn't cost anything. And Bob 
Bernath gave all the concrete. And Dr. Boyle, Dow

05:45.207 --> 05:50.674
Chemical, gave all the insulation. Of course, Dee 
Dee and Gene Donahoe both donated their services.

05:58.765 --> 05:58.965
R.B. Butler built it at his cost of first rate 
materials. I've always thought it is pleasant

06:05.965 --> 06:10.752
looking but not ostentatious. But you know there 
was some one architecture professor in

06:10.772 --> 06:34.386
particular that took exception to it he said after 
all this is the 1960s not the 1860s he thought it

06:10.772 --> 06:34.386
should be a contemporary and the first plan 
Haskell was the most contemporary thing you've

06:10.772 --> 06:34.386
ever seen and we were over there I was at home 
without Earl and over there on Lee Street And this

06:35.986 --> 06:39.270
man came and spread them out on the dining room 
table. I had to stop myself to keep from gasping. It

06:43.536 --> 06:48.983
was one story, and it looked like Memorial Funeral 
Home, only larger. And the window went all the way

06:50.124 --> 06:53.829
up into the eave, you know. And he walked in, and 
there was a little square in the center of the

06:54.890 --> 06:59.076
foyer. And I said, what's that? He said, that's 
where the heating and air conditioning is, in the

06:59.957 --> 07:04.002
foyer. And on the left hand side was living room, 
dining room, breakfast room, kitchen, utility,

07:05.095 --> 07:13.087
garage. And then on the right, there's a long 
hallway with bedrooms all the way up and down it. So

07:18.495 --> 07:21.159
I said, well, I'll show it to Earl just the minute he 
comes in. Earl had the same opinion of it as I did.

07:26.848 --> 07:28.470
And then we were at a party at Henry Clay's a couple 
of weeks later, and D.D. Matthews was there, and he

07:31.726 --> 07:36.571
said, is anything doing on the plans of the 
president's house? I said, well, they brought a

07:36.611 --> 07:40.535
set of plans by, but we don't care for them. He said, 
what are you having in mind? I said, well, I think

07:42.538 --> 07:45.060
Georgian Colonial is always pretty. And he said, 
let me fool around with it and see what I can come up

07:45.941 --> 07:48.764
with. So he drew the plan. And he didn't charge, as I 
understand it, and Gene didn't either for their

07:51.107 --> 07:55.371
services. I've always thought it was very 
pleasant. Did the children like it? Oh, yeah. We

08:01.751 --> 08:02.612
all enjoyed it. How did the children, what were 
their experiences at A&M Solid Aids schools? Did

08:10.943 --> 08:14.727
they ever have anybody pick on them because they 
were the sons or daughters? You know, I don't

08:14.807 --> 08:20.394
think, they were not really conscious of the fact 
their daddy did what he did. None of my kids. They

08:23.538 --> 08:25.741
were all, you know, just ordinary. Good, good. uh 
let's see uh do you remember any good bull aggie

08:27.901 --> 08:50.854
jokes or anything that happened in or around the 
president's house or office yeah i remember when

08:27.901 --> 08:50.854
he got burned in effigy in the middle of the night 
one night scared me half to death uh because of the

08:27.901 --> 08:50.854
admitting the girls oh where was that right there 
In the old house that was on 100 Jones Street, as I

08:51.627 --> 09:03.323
remember the address, and it had this huge oak tree 
out in front, and they put a dummy up there and set it

08:51.627 --> 09:03.323
on fire, whatever. But you say good bull. You know, 
there's, I think, a couple of books that has that

09:07.849 --> 09:19.305
title, and I was asked to put my stamp of approval on 
one, but I read the first bit of it, and I thought,

09:07.849 --> 09:19.305
mm-mm, not going to do that. I would tell you why if 
you didn't have that machine going. Do you

09:25.051 --> 09:32.398
remember any things being left on the front porch? 
Did anybody ever leave any? Yeah, there's one

09:36.181 --> 09:37.503
horrible. In the new house, I still call it the new 
house, some animal they left dead there. But we

09:46.671 --> 09:48.533
just called somebody, and they came and got it. Oh, 
and let's see, the dog. Ranger. Ranger. Yeah. Now,

09:53.822 --> 09:56.786
where, how old was Ranger? Did y'all bring Ranger 
to College Station? No. We had had one in Brady.

10:04.197 --> 10:04.498
Okay. Earl, when Earl was on that Victory Loan 
train roundabout, when he got to Shreveport, I

10:04.518 --> 10:15.955
believe, Louisiana. Everywhere the train would 
stop, Earl would see if he could find an English

10:17.150 --> 10:21.215
Bulldog. And you know, I was so dumb, it didn't 
occur to me why he always wanted an English

10:21.636 --> 10:26.803
Bulldog. Well, he played on Eden's first football 
team, and they were the Bulldogs, and they were

10:27.624 --> 10:33.191
these ugly English Bulldogs. And then when he 
coached at Brady, same thing. They were the

10:36.215 --> 10:38.138
English Bulldogs as a mascot. That's why. And 
that's the only kind of dog he'd even consider. But

10:43.120 --> 10:49.956
he got that one when he was on this Victor Loom train 
tour. And we met the train, the kids and I, Bud and

10:51.018 --> 10:59.678
Ann and I, in San Antonio, and I went ahead We had a 
reservation at the St. Anthony's, got them to bed,

11:00.063 --> 11:13.378
and Earl came, rapped on the door, and I opened the 
door, and there he was with a soldier behind him

11:00.063 --> 11:13.378
carrying a big box, and I couldn't imagine. He had 
not told me what to expect, and it was a little

11:14.900 --> 11:22.729
English bulldog puppy, five or six weeks old. And 
it was on a three-hour schedule to eat. And every

11:27.139 --> 11:29.603
three hours, that little dog would yelp. And so I 
knew that as soon as I got him back to Brady, I was

11:30.585 --> 11:36.734
going to break that habit, which I did. But he was 
just a little over two years old, and a dog poisoner

11:37.576 --> 11:41.802
at Brady got him. He was the first ranger. And they 
threw the poison in the yard he was in the yard.

11:49.658 --> 11:55.044
Anyway, then the next one we had, Bud found it in 
Austin. He knew that Earl liked that kind of dog.

11:58.027 --> 12:00.610
But we had a little terrier. It's somebody who 
couldn't take it to where they were moving in an

12:01.672 --> 12:06.517
apartment. And they gave it to us. It was a cute 
little old dog. It wasn't a fine dog or anything,

12:09.641 --> 12:13.365
but we all liked it. And Earl had been out of town and 
had Bud driving him And they came in late at night,

12:19.848 --> 12:24.274
and that little old dog always just slept beside 
the driveway. And as they came in with the lights,

12:25.075 --> 12:29.582
it jumped up, ran in front of the car, and they 
killed it. Bud was driving, and he was just upset it

12:30.203 --> 12:31.985
could be. So he went to Austin, and he found this 
bulldog that everybody liked. The kids, you know,

12:39.415 --> 12:41.058
it was such a character. And I guess it was probably 
about seven years old, maybe. And... would eat in

12:51.067 --> 12:52.669
the mess hall. Kids would feed him. And he, I think 
he died from being overfed. He had a kidney

12:58.855 --> 12:59.936
disease. He died during SCONA one year. And all the 
kids, oh, they were all upset and had the biggest

13:04.381 --> 13:10.687
dog funeral I bet there ever was. The whole Corps 
was there, which meant everybody, you know. And

13:15.412 --> 13:19.837
all we had to do was to pick the spot where we wanted 
him buried. They took over from there. So then that

13:23.011 --> 13:26.954
was just before Christmas. At that time, they had 
Skona before Christmas. And so the next spring

13:30.317 --> 13:50.755
then, at senior banquet, I've forgotten who came 
to me, but whoever asked me could I. Oh, they had

13:30.317 --> 13:50.755
gone to Earl's office and found out that we were 
slated to go to Tarleton for the retirement of E.J.

13:50.775 --> 13:52.056
Howe, who was president. And they came and asked me 
if I could make some excuse and not go with Earl to

13:54.095 --> 14:07.242
Tarleton and bring Bob over there to the banquet 
because they were going to get this new puppy. And

14:08.785 --> 14:10.889
so that's what I did. And Bob was at the age where he 
Didn't want to get out of his blue jeans or just

14:13.805 --> 14:18.991
bored him to death to dress up. But I finally got him 
to go with me. And they gave him the dog. And when

14:25.359 --> 14:28.563
that dog was two years old, Earl was home. I mean, 
Earl and was home visiting. And Earl said, come on,

14:33.028 --> 14:37.894
let's go out. Let me show you a lot at the lake, 
Carter Lake. And Had Davis at that time had the two

14:42.323 --> 14:48.531
lots next to ours where Frank Vandiver lives now. 
And so he had a little rowboat. And he asked Bob if he

14:54.878 --> 14:57.441
wanted to take it out, and of course Bob did. And 
when Bob got in the boat, the dog jumped in with him.

15:01.346 --> 15:07.133
He rowed out kind of in the center of the lake, and 
without any warning, the dog just dived in.

15:08.024 --> 15:09.888
Drowned. Oh, my. And, oh, it just upset Bob 
something awful. But anyway, there, that one

15:13.576 --> 15:14.839
went. And so we got that dog buried before they 
could have a big funeral. In the days, the present

15:20.731 --> 15:27.345
days here, what did y'all do for relaxation? Not 
much. Movies were out of the ordinary. I remember

15:32.618 --> 15:35.361
one night he said, I want us to go to the movie. And 
they were showing Darby's Rangers. It was a movie.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.229
And I don't remember us going to any other movie 
together. Did he go fishing, hunting? He was not a

15:46.893 --> 15:47.693
hunter. Now, if somebody wanted to go to the ranch 
and hunt, maybe he'd go with them, but he was not

15:48.234 --> 15:53.520
much of a hunter. And he didn't fish much, did he? 
No. He just didn't have many... And you all didn't

16:00.370 --> 16:03.773
take many long vacation trips. In 1967, it was 
simply because he was to go to these places that A&M

16:04.854 --> 16:14.343
had something going. But we did kind of, he took me 
along and made, you know, he paid for me. And we did

16:21.650 --> 16:26.996
go around the world at that time because you get a 
certain distance away, you might as well go around

16:21.650 --> 16:26.996
the rest of the way. So we did that. We were gone 
close to a month. That's the longest.

16:35.136 --> 16:42.168
Do you remember any accomplishments that you 
think gave him great pride here? Any changes? Oh,

16:44.472 --> 16:45.013
at A&M? I think the fact that he got the changes made 
that he felt like it had to be made for A&M to grow. I

16:53.542 --> 16:57.287
think that was something he was proud of. Okay. But 
he didn't live to see what really happened. Right.

17:02.213 --> 17:07.700
Do you remember any things that you think were 
frustrations to him that he wished he could have

17:02.213 --> 17:07.700
done? Nope. I can't think of anything offhand. I 
don't have any in mind. No, I can't think of any. One

17:15.651 --> 17:17.593
day... I was in his office and he asked me about 
Private Slovik. Does that name ring a bell? That

17:25.355 --> 17:26.376
little red book right there. And he told me that 
that was just about one of the toughest things he'd

17:26.396 --> 17:32.163
ever had to be a part of. That was a stupid movie, 
too. Yeah, the movie was particular. Then in my

17:41.674 --> 17:44.998
last conversation with him, you may have heard me 
say, to others, I said to him, nobody but you could

17:45.485 --> 17:48.750
have done all that. And he said, oh, why? And I said, 
because nobody could have said you weren't a

17:50.393 --> 18:05.156
Texan, you weren't an Aggie, you hadn't served 
your country, that you're one of those

17:50.393 --> 18:05.156
fuddy-duddy PhDs that's just here for a little 
while passing through, and that you don't know

17:50.393 --> 18:05.156
Governor Conley and President Johnson. And he 
leaned back and smiled and he said, oh, I never

18:05.656 --> 18:09.282
thought about any of that. And I said, yeah, I'm 
sure you didn't. He was funny. He just, you know,

18:13.688 --> 18:20.257
Earl just, he didn't have a big ego. No. Now, let's 
see. And he didn't play cards with a group of the

18:22.561 --> 18:25.084
buddies, did he? He didn't shoot pool. No, he just 
didn't. He didn't relax a whole lot. See that

18:33.616 --> 18:38.422
little red book right there on top?

18:38.722 --> 18:43.808
It should be a mark in there of his message to his 
troops after the execution. See, he didn't have

18:44.349 --> 18:46.672
anything to do with the decision. Oh, I know. It had 
already been made and approved all the way up to

18:47.533 --> 18:51.438
Eisenhower. Right. No, let's see. There it is. 
There it is. No? Did you find his message to his

18:54.622 --> 18:56.404
troops? Yes, ma'am. Read that. It's pretty 
straightforward. Oh, yes. uh the uh now he did

19:01.574 --> 19:26.788
enjoy going to the ranch didn't he yeah just to go 
yeah drive around yeah uh not very long after he was

19:01.574 --> 19:26.788
home i remember my dad thought he'd probably lost 
his mind he bought a d8 tractor and he hired a

19:01.574 --> 19:26.788
operator to

19:29.536 --> 19:35.106
Well, they would go and bulldoze all the way around 
all the pastures, you know. And, oh, it did all

19:35.927 --> 19:38.011
kinds of things. And Earl loved nothing better 
than get there on the thing and ride it. He loved it.

19:44.964 --> 19:46.346
But he wasn't...

19:49.372 --> 19:50.734
He didn't really... do too much ranching he always 
just had somebody hired to do that all right let's

19:52.030 --> 20:19.354
uh we'll go on the on the the finish up now when did 
his health begin to decline I didn't really I was

19:52.030 --> 20:19.354
not aware of it you know being around him every day 
but uh in let's see in 1969 he was invited by British

20:20.077 --> 20:23.961
TV to be in a film called 10 Men Went to War. And what 
it would do, they'd take these 10 men. One of them

20:28.787 --> 20:32.030
was a fellow you talked about hanging on the 
steeple in St. Mary's Glace. And Earl's, of

20:33.192 --> 20:35.654
course, was a Point to Hope thing. And they would 
take them to where something significant had

20:37.276 --> 20:42.182
happened to them during the war. And then they'd 
film them in their present location. And Earl was

20:47.752 --> 20:52.157
real pleased to have them come here before the crew 
came here. And he had them observe a final review

20:53.278 --> 20:59.385
and I don't know what all. Oh, I do too know that they 
wanted to film his ranch activities, but it was too

21:00.867 --> 21:05.913
far to go to the ranch. It's about a four and a half 
hour drive to go out there. And I've got to go out

21:08.856 --> 21:13.742
there if the doctor will let me. 10th of July, we're 
going to have the family reunion. It's my turn. So

21:19.260 --> 21:21.744
we're going to do it, but we're not going to do it at 
the house. We're going to do it in Menard at the

21:21.784 --> 21:27.273
little country club because there's a pool there 
and the little ones like to swim. But I

21:28.214 --> 21:33.924
got wound up and distracted. What was I talking 
about? Oh, you were talking about his health and

21:34.845 --> 21:37.550
the crew. Oh, his health. But this film, I didn't 
realize, but when I saw the film, and we got a copy of

21:40.672 --> 21:47.902
it after he was gone, he never saw it. They filmed 
it, British TV did, for the 25th anniversary of

21:48.843 --> 21:55.993
D-Day, thinking they could get it shown over here 
too, but it didn't happen. And I could tell by

21:57.595 --> 22:04.204
listening to his voice there that something was 
wrong. So I don't really know when I noticed it sort

22:05.106 --> 22:08.991
of going, but...

22:12.245 --> 22:22.636
When he came in the day that he got sick in the night, 
we had the doctor, which is OC, come.

22:24.318 --> 22:30.145
And I thought maybe he got sick because I had the 
help doing something else and I fixed Mexican

22:24.318 --> 22:30.145
food. I thought maybe that made him sick. I don't 
know. But we put him in the hospital the next

22:33.749 --> 22:36.792
morning. And so...

22:43.598 --> 22:49.526
I guess it was the next night that he had sort of a 
stroke, she thought. And O.C. said, I think we

22:51.288 --> 22:53.291
ought to take him to Houston. And I had driven Earl. 
See, he had me driving him, too, at the last thing.

22:59.119 --> 23:05.467
And I had driven him down for a meeting of the 
Tentacle Executive Board. That was a once-proud

23:06.749 --> 23:09.072
company that's gone down the drain. Oh, it makes me 
ill. And I held on to it, wouldn't you know? But

23:14.497 --> 23:21.664
Lupo's wife, Evelyn, was in the hospital at the 
medical center. So after Earl got through this

23:21.724 --> 23:26.049
business stuff, we went out to see her. And when we 
got there, Earl said, this is one of the finest

23:27.650 --> 23:31.314
medical complexes in the world. So I thought, 
that's where we need to go then. So the ambulance,

23:34.477 --> 23:43.626
of course, took him in OC, said he would ride the 
ambulance with him and for me not to try to think I

23:34.477 --> 23:43.626
could get there by the time they did. Now that's 
March or January? Oh, January. He was there two

23:50.888 --> 23:53.894
months before he died. As you look back yourself on 
these A&M years, which friends do you cherish the

23:54.896 --> 24:05.479
most? Well, you know, it's kind of like my 
sister-in-law and Brady who died a year or so ago.

24:12.468 --> 24:14.251
She said all of her friends were in the cemetery. So 
the ones that I was with the most have passed on. Oh,

24:18.139 --> 24:18.900
but what? You know, the dean's wives. We were sort 
of a close-knit group. Others, were there, did you

24:24.932 --> 24:28.058
have any special friends off campus?

24:31.109 --> 24:32.912
I don't know when Ann White and I got started. She's 
my running buddy now. Yeah, I think of Ann as a

24:35.116 --> 24:37.340
special friend. Oh, she's a very special friend. 
Now, let's see, y'all Methodist? Yeah. And like

24:42.308 --> 24:54.990
I've heard down through the years, some stories 
that it helped if you were a Methodist or a

24:42.308 --> 24:54.990
Presbyterian to be in the administration at... at 
A&M. We used to call it the Methodist Mafia. Yeah,

24:58.499 --> 25:05.789
that's... Because, see, Gib Geltrude started 
with him, and then, I don't know, anybody between

24:58.499 --> 25:05.789
him and Earl. And, of course, Jack Williams was 
Methodist. Weren't the Harringtons Methodists?

25:09.495 --> 25:10.296
No, they were Baptists. Oh, that's right. They 
were Baptists, yes. Very Baptists. Yes, yes, yes,

25:12.499 --> 25:13.821
yes, yes. Yeah. And the Williams certainly 
were... Methodists. All right. Were you aware of

25:17.887 --> 25:24.977
communication between Mr. Rutter and Jack 
Williams in 1969? Well, when Jack came down here, I

25:26.105 --> 25:32.031
don't know what the exact title was, the head of 
kind of education. Commissioner of Higher

25:32.051 --> 25:33.152
Education. Yeah.

25:36.276 --> 25:44.244
They came over here, and Earl said something to me 
about making Jack executive vice president. This

25:44.884 --> 25:46.106
was long before Earl died. Not real long, but last 
year or so. And I think Earl, he never told me. But I

25:54.607 --> 26:00.695
really think that he had planned to retire about 
the time he and him had their centennial, 76. And he

26:02.838 --> 26:06.383
called me one day and just like he's kind of like my 
dad. My dad would have a land deal figured out

26:06.523 --> 26:09.687
before he let my mother in on it. He's going to buy 
this ranch.

26:14.254 --> 26:15.035
But Earl sent. Well. Bill Carl, was that his name? 
The real estate man? He said, I'm going to send Bill

26:23.203 --> 26:24.725
to pick you up. I want him to show you something. 
That's all he told me. And you know where the A&M

26:28.129 --> 26:38.823
setup is out near the Brazos River, where they're 
having so much trouble, the people across the road

26:28.129 --> 26:38.823
don't want the pigs? Earl could have bought that 
whole thing for 500 an acre. Oh, how beautiful. And

26:45.752 --> 26:48.475
he wanted me to see the house that was there. I guess 
he's still there I don't know but anyway he had Bill

26:48.708 --> 27:16.369
Carlton pick me up and take me out there and show me 
that house and I guess he would have gone ahead and

26:48.708 --> 27:16.369
bought it if I had been a little more in favor of it 
but I said I don't know what you want to do with any

26:48.708 --> 27:16.369
more land I said you don't have time to look after 
what we have and see what we did my parents gave us

26:48.708 --> 27:16.369
half of the ranch and then my dad uh, called one day 
and said for us to come out and not bring the

27:17.902 --> 27:22.068
children. I thought, what's the matter with him? 
He never told us not to bring the children. And it

27:26.796 --> 27:28.639
was because he wanted to talk business. He said, 
it's not very often you can buy a piece of land that

27:28.719 --> 27:31.944
joins you. Well, the same amount that we had been 
given, see, he gave the two brothers more than he

27:31.964 --> 27:43.842
gave my sister and me, but that was okay.

27:45.593 --> 27:51.580
Anyway, he had deeded this to my younger brother 
that had the home place on it, their house and all.

27:53.122 --> 27:57.466
And it did join what we had had. And so we agreed to 
buy it before we came home that night. And Earl made

28:02.192 --> 28:07.198
the last payment on that in December and got sick in 
January. Just had paid it off. And paid on it 20

28:10.261 --> 28:12.163
years. So at least that was paid off. He would have 
gone in debt and left me with a debt of a million

28:16.643 --> 28:25.471
dollars, and I think it would have driven me crazy, 
because I don't like debt now. My dad liked debt,

28:25.491 --> 28:29.374
but I didn't like debt.

28:30.815 --> 28:34.819
But what he told me that day has turned out to be 
what's happened. It had three miles of

28:35.920 --> 28:43.186
riverfront, and I said, I don't know what you want, 
more land? He said, well, I figured that I could

28:43.206 --> 28:45.368
develop the half of it closest to College Station 
and make enough off of that to clear the other half.

28:50.504 --> 28:52.406
I said you probably could but when you're going to 
have time. So he never did go through it but he was

28:53.627 --> 28:56.809
right about to. And you know there's nice homes on 
that part that's close to College Station. I've

29:04.095 --> 29:13.423
always thought to live on the east side of the river 
on the high bank looking across the river would be a

29:04.095 --> 29:13.423
very special place. Well I do know this that You 
know John Knox and his wife Lou, they bought some

29:16.195 --> 29:24.870
and it was 1,500 acres by the time they bought it so 
it was going up. Earl could have bought it at 500

29:25.070 --> 29:28.656
acres. Let's see, can you think of any topics that 
we haven't touched on? I think I just shoot the

29:35.112 --> 29:38.716
breeze and don't say much of anything. No, no, no. 
This is just special. I want to close by thanking

29:41.480 --> 29:54.356
you and assure you that when we get this typed, 
we'll get it back to you for you to edit in whatever

29:41.480 --> 29:54.356
fashion you want. Let's see. Let's make believe 
that somebody gave you a million dollars now with

29:55.017 --> 30:03.988
the stipulation that you were to give it to Texas 
A&M for whatever reason. cause you want what would

30:05.183 --> 30:33.351
you want them to do with the money well I don't 
really know but you know when I was on student

30:05.183 --> 30:33.351
government at that other school in Austin we 
passed a resolution requesting that the board

30:05.183 --> 30:33.351
establish a school of fine arts and they did and 
it's it's going great guns and I think A&M should

30:05.183 --> 30:33.351
have one well I understand that's part of vision 
2020 dream yeah Vision 2020 Dream. Let me close

30:36.999 --> 30:41.839
then by thanking you and my deep appreciation, and 
I'll turn this machine off.
