WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:13.754
At any rate, I left in 69, went out to Great 
Southwest Corporation to, I was asked to come out

00:01.600 --> 00:13.754
there and set up a department that didn't exist, 
Department of Planning and Design, which I did.

00:15.096 --> 00:18.060
Just take a minute to describe the Great 
Southwest. Well, Great Southwest Corporation

00:18.220 --> 00:28.111
was a company that held over 6,000 acres of land, 
dead center between Dallas and Fort Worth. Why is

00:29.533 --> 00:30.274
it important? Why is it important to Texas? Why 
it's Great Southwest Corp? Well, first of all, it

00:35.063 --> 00:48.664
was probably, to my knowledge, it was the first 
really massive development project that was

00:35.063 --> 00:48.664
primarily oriented toward industrial 
development at that scale. It also was

00:48.964 --> 00:59.400
significant because in the original people that 
were involved in it, you not only had the Wim

00:48.964 --> 00:59.400
family, but you had the Rockefellers, you had 
Vincent Ponty, You had Sam Zisman. O'Neal Ford was

01:03.082 --> 01:06.728
out there designing the NS6 flags. And Candela, 
the famous structural engineer from Mexico, was

01:06.788 --> 01:16.303
up designing hyperbolic paraboloids, 
freestanding. And there was a pulling together, a

01:16.863 --> 01:28.341
coalescing of the talent that I think had not been 
seen before on that type of project in this area.

01:29.097 --> 01:34.006
That would be my answer to the question.

01:34.106 --> 01:47.190
At the time that I went out there, the Great 
Southwest Corporation had been purchased by Penn

01:34.106 --> 01:47.190
Central, along with Arbita Corporation in 
Florida Oh, what was the one I keep trying to forget

01:47.525 --> 01:50.247
in California? Macco. And at any rate, I went out 
there and I did do that. And that was my first entry

01:57.173 --> 02:00.857
into real estate development. And then Penn 
Central derailed itself in 1970.

02:07.242 --> 02:10.345
And everybody practically left the company. And 
when that happened, within the next two months

02:11.386 --> 02:17.211
later, I was employed. by Raymond Asher to work on 
the Flower Mound New Town project, and I was

02:17.798 --> 02:30.452
employed to be in charge of planning. I was in 
charge of what was called Director of Community

02:30.692 --> 02:39.161
Planning for Flower Mound New Town, which was one 
of the Title VII New Towns. Oh, yeah. And that was

02:40.242 --> 02:43.025
6,200 acres of land. If you, near, well, it would be 
west of, yeah, west of Louisville between

02:47.701 --> 02:57.132
Interstate 35, between the two Interstate 35s 
that merge and go up to Denton from Dallas and Fort

02:47.701 --> 02:57.132
Worth. The other person, major person involved in 
that was Edward Marcus of the Neiman Marcus

02:59.074 --> 03:06.863
family. And I did that for about two years. And that 
was quite a significant undertaking in in Texas.

03:16.923 --> 03:21.107
It and I think the Woodlands was the only other 
Title VII new town. The Woodlands ended up being

03:23.490 --> 03:41.569
much more successful than Flower Mound did 
because Flower Mound unfortunately had a problem

03:23.490 --> 03:41.569
of the plan, the way the planning had been done to 
get to the approval of HUD. the way in which the

03:42.241 --> 03:46.668
decisions were made, or more accurately, not made 
after that time. And it ended up being just an

03:47.750 --> 03:56.503
opportunity that should have been fulfilled and 
wasn't. This was another instance where I worked

03:56.523 --> 04:01.411
with Springer. Because Springer represented the 
town of Flower Mound as their planter, and I

04:01.932 --> 04:09.844
essentially was the counterpart for Flower Mound 
Newtown. So we worked. trying to bring the Flower

04:11.148 --> 04:26.809
Mound New Town

04:11.148 --> 04:26.809
plan and the comprehensive plan for the 22,000 
acres, as I recall, that constituted Flower Mound

04:11.148 --> 04:26.809
itself into sync with one another at the same time. 
And I should add that the reason why I went into the

04:27.650 --> 04:37.864
real estate development arena was quite simply 
because for the same reason that I went from

04:38.198 --> 04:40.541
architecture to planning initially. And that was 
that I felt that the, well, in the case of

04:40.561 --> 05:01.926
architecture, that there was a problem as a 
consultant in being somewhere in the process, but

04:40.561 --> 05:01.926
having significant things happening on each side 
of you that could either distort what you were

04:40.561 --> 05:01.926
doing or preempt the result of what you did. And 
that was certainly true in architecture. I found

05:05.471 --> 05:07.513
the problem to be also true in planning with some 
additional problems, one of which was that,

05:08.118 --> 05:21.452
number one, people really didn't take planning 
very seriously in this part of the country. And

05:21.992 --> 05:26.096
number two, the politicians, many of them were 
actually afraid of it. And so therefore, it ended

05:26.737 --> 05:36.387
up being an exercise of planners talking to one 
another and recommending things that We're not

05:36.839 --> 05:43.668
really germane to what the political 
policymakers thought they were doing. Real

05:44.669 --> 05:48.354
estate development, the reason I went there was 
recognizing those problems. I wanted to put

05:48.434 --> 06:05.597
myself in a position where I felt I would be at the 
center of decision-making with respect to what

05:48.434 --> 06:05.597
went on the ground and the belief that there was 
probably more, at that period of time, more

05:48.434 --> 06:05.597
potential influence for the good in creating 
urban or urban-related environments to be in the

06:05.864 --> 06:23.244
private sector, then in a high decision-making 
position, then to try to convince people from the

06:05.864 --> 06:23.244
public side that they ought to be doing something 
that they didn't understand. I think Vernon and

06:24.465 --> 06:27.669
Mary Lou share that view. Yeah. I think I would... 
I'm very satisfied that I made that transition. I

06:32.815 --> 06:34.437
think it's... proven to be true, although I look 
around Dallas and some other places and realize

06:34.973 --> 06:43.461
that it certainly is not a panacea for urban 
problems.

06:46.424 --> 06:46.765
What is? Nothing. But it certainly is more 
personally satisfying. Well, there's a lot to be

06:53.251 --> 06:55.213
said for that.

07:00.658 --> 07:03.681
You know, you asked me the question earlier about 
what I thought had been accomplished in Texas with

07:04.420 --> 07:07.483
respect to planning. And I think I answered that, 
well, I'm one of those that says you look at the

07:07.564 --> 07:15.773
results and then you just determine whether the 
methods were successful or not. And I would say

07:15.793 --> 07:27.426
that from that point of view, I think urban 
planning in Texas has been almost, across the

07:15.793 --> 07:27.426
board, unsuccessful. In my view, all you have to do 
is, certainly from a comprehensive planning

07:28.026 --> 07:33.853
point of view, if not small sector or project point 
of view. We have some examples of project areas and

07:36.331 --> 07:41.415
sectors and things which are certainly 
exceptions. But overall, I think one would have to

07:41.435 --> 07:52.706
stretch very far to say that much has been 
accomplished, particularly when you look at our

07:41.435 --> 07:52.706
major cities. You look at Houston, which I 
consider to be basically unlivable,

07:52.846 --> 07:57.730
uninhabitable. Dallas, fast approaching that. 
Fort Worth is still livable. That's only because

08:02.534 --> 08:04.296
the impact of poverty population hasn't hit it as 
hard as it has some of the others. Austin is

08:08.210 --> 08:12.635
destroying itself methodically. San Antonio is 
doing the same thing. So I think you have to say

08:16.300 --> 08:29.337
that, and I think that one of the reasons for that is 
that we have never had any strong mandating type of

08:16.300 --> 08:29.337
leadership at a state level for planning. 
Planning in Texas at a state level is a vacuum.

08:32.601 --> 08:33.762
Always has been a vacuum. It runs through counter 
to the spouse philosophy of state and the business

08:34.668 --> 08:46.767
interest and the politicians and the lawyers and 
you name it. It's counter to all of that. There is no

08:50.152 --> 08:56.201
imperative in Texas at a state level, and 
therefore there's no imperative at a local level.

08:56.682 --> 09:01.890
We do not have planning yet, but to my knowledge, 
that's effective. except maybe in a few places at

09:02.410 --> 09:09.499
the county level, although it's now, I think the 
legislation now exists for counties to plan. For a

09:09.539 --> 09:13.925
long time, they were prohibited from planning or 
zoning or anything else. And a few are beginning to

09:14.726 --> 09:16.449
take advantage. I understand Collin County, for 
example, is about to start looking hard at a county

09:16.489 --> 09:27.583
plan and zoning and all that, and a few others have. 
Even Rouse's County considered a county planner a

09:27.904 --> 09:31.168
couple years ago. But typically what the counties 
have done is they've limited all of their activity

09:31.908 --> 09:43.683
if they had any to roadway planning, and that's it, 
and intermeshing with the State Highway

09:31.908 --> 09:43.683
Department to try to assure themselves they're 
going to get all the funds they want. But I do think

09:43.703 --> 10:00.885
that if I scratch the inside of my head and try to 
find one good example, the only one that really

09:43.703 --> 10:00.885
pops to mind is that I think is worth looking at and 
worth studying and worth learning from is the, and

10:01.540 --> 10:19.580
there may be others, but this is the one I'm aware 
of, is the planning that has occurred in Dallas for

10:01.540 --> 10:19.580
water supply, which was triggered by, as I 
understand it, and Marvin, you should talk to

10:01.540 --> 10:19.580
Marvin about this, was triggered by the drought. 
And while he was still planning director, and he

10:19.840 --> 10:29.691
may have had some hand in this in 1956 or 57, 
something like that, when Dallas was having to

10:30.194 --> 10:31.696
haul in water. It was in very serious straits. 
Henry Grazer, who was for many years the head of the

10:35.360 --> 10:53.402
water department, and the city of Dallas mounted a 
very, very aggressive planning program to bring a

10:35.360 --> 10:53.402
long-range water supply to the city, which I think 
has been very successful and is recognized as

10:35.360 --> 10:53.402
being successful. The city went out and analyzed 
what its needs were going to be. They analyzed

10:58.650 --> 11:03.196
where the sources of water could come from, where 
they were going to have to make up the shortfall.

11:03.797 --> 11:18.616
And the result of it was that the city went out and 
bought large areas of land or got long-term leases

11:03.797 --> 11:18.616
or whatever they did in remote areas from Dallas so 
that reservoirs could be built to supplement the

11:03.797 --> 11:18.616
water supply as needed. And these reservoirs have 
continued to be built. Dallas is one of a city in the

11:23.266 --> 11:35.338
United States which has relatively modest 
rainfall, which is in good shape with respect to

11:23.266 --> 11:35.338
water supply. You were talking a bit ago about 
Flower Mound and the problems it had experienced,

11:36.899 --> 11:46.609
some of which were connected with HUD. Yes. Also, 
the same thing applied to The Woodlands, they had

11:52.190 --> 12:01.904
problems with HUD getting payments and so forth, 
and reviews conducted in a timely way, and so

11:52.190 --> 12:01.904
forth. So there's a basic problem. There was a 
basic problem with the Title VII program, in my

12:03.426 --> 12:06.531
opinion. It was the Achilles heel. It was there 
from the beginning. And it was not recognized. You

12:10.517 --> 12:21.893
can take for a long, long time, and you can take all 
of the problems that existed with respect to

12:10.517 --> 12:21.893
selection criteria and methods of selection for 
projects. and say that that was part of the

12:22.531 --> 12:24.874
problem. It certainly was. But the biggest part of 
the problem was that you had a program that was

12:25.455 --> 12:35.269
based upon some beautifully crafted 
legislation. The incentive to a developer to be in

12:35.769 --> 12:52.032
that program, however, was built around the

12:35.769 --> 12:52.032
part of the program which was going to provide 
funds to encourage innovation, new ways of doing

12:35.769 --> 12:52.032
things, whether for cost-effective or social 
reasons or physical environmental reasons. But

12:59.052 --> 13:02.136
this was at the center of the legislation. 
Unfortunately, as with so many other programs,

13:02.817 --> 13:09.985
the funding never materialized. So what you had 
was a number of projects, many of which were badly

13:10.606 --> 13:17.074
conceived, And I worked on another one you don't 
know about, but I was a consultant for a while when I

13:17.527 --> 13:26.817
was with Great Southwest Corporation to Floyd 
McKissick at Soul City. Is that what it was called?

13:29.420 --> 13:29.620
Yeah. Which was a Title 70 town, which had never 
been approved in the first place. It was approved

13:34.926 --> 13:36.528
for all the wrong reasons.

13:40.232 --> 13:42.494
Basically, integration. Yeah, and it was just... 
Ridiculous. That's a whole other take. But

13:48.272 --> 13:53.979
anyway, I was a consultant then and made a number of 
trips there and wrote reports and did all that. But

13:54.740 --> 13:56.243
there, you could see it there. You could see it at 
Sea Riverside. You could see it at the woodlands.

13:59.807 --> 14:00.889
You could see it at Flower Mound. You could see any 
number of these projects, Jonathan, wherever.

14:08.840 --> 14:09.801
The funding wasn't there. What happened was that 
the landowners and developers Yeah, two

14:14.345 --> 14:16.368
situations happened. You had the well-intended 
ones that got sucked into the program, like in

14:16.388 --> 14:28.623
Eddie Marcus in Flower Mound, not understanding 
that the funding would not be there to do the

14:16.388 --> 14:28.623
innovation to support all of the things, you know, 
that were going to make this town special. And yet

14:29.204 --> 14:35.352
he had to put up with all of the insane bureaucratic 
requirements and so forth. And so that was a losing

14:36.133 --> 14:39.477
proposition. The other situation that occurred 
quite frequently was you had of people who had

14:43.454 --> 14:49.882
political connections who were trying to unload 
essentially bad projects. And they succeeded.

14:53.366 --> 14:56.430
Most of them made a lot of money. But I would put some 
of those in the same category as the ISRI 20 condo

14:56.450 --> 15:03.318
scandal in Dallas. And so Flyer Mound, in my 
opinion, was doomed from the beginning to ever be

15:05.001 --> 15:11.048
what Ray Nash and Eddie Marcus wanted it to be. We 
have two other so-called new towns in Texas who we

15:16.274 --> 15:20.861
haven't talked about. One is the San Antonio new 
town. Oh, yes. And the other is Las Colinas. San

15:25.407 --> 15:28.511
Antonio Ranch, is that what you're talking about? 
Ranch, yeah. Well, one of the people who was at the

15:30.234 --> 15:37.744
center of Flower Mounds, also at the center of San 
Antonio Ranch, Mr. Bob Hanson, And some of the

15:38.500 --> 15:52.156
problems that were created at San Antonio Ranch 
and some of the problems at Flower Mound

15:38.500 --> 15:52.156
come from some of the same reasons. As far as Las 
Colinas is concerned, Las Colinas may very well

15:52.616 --> 16:07.073
turn out to be the most successful in the long haul 
of all of them, mainly because it's

16:08.352 --> 16:18.266
Columbia, Newtown, it's got the force of will of a 
strong individual behind it and the financial

16:08.352 --> 16:18.266
wherewithal to pull it off. Who is behind Los 
Angeles? Ben Carpenter. That's land that was,

16:23.874 --> 16:28.800
really the core of his land that was owned by the 
Carpenter family for years and years and years.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.248
Since it's been expanded, I think it's up around 
what, 8,000 acres now? Something, I really don't

16:34.689 --> 16:36.131
know. They've purchased more land. It seems to be 
very well regarded. It is, yeah. And there's some

16:42.083 --> 16:58.066
very good things, like the Urban Center is very, 
you know, there's some things I would change or not

16:42.083 --> 16:58.066
do if I were doing it, but if you think about the 
possible alternative that might have happened

16:42.083 --> 16:58.066
out there, I think one should not spend a lot of time 
worrying about what isn't there. And I think Las

16:58.246 --> 17:06.658
Colinas has a lot of potential left in it, and... 
But, and I haven't been to the woodlands in a long

17:08.748 --> 17:17.058
time, so I really don't know what's happening out 
there. We conduct field trips over there

17:17.258 --> 17:21.744
frequently, because it's fairly close. And it 
seems to be going along well. The

17:25.849 --> 17:36.301
villages are filling up, and the commercial 
center is operating well. As far as I know, they

17:36.982 --> 17:38.704
don't have financial problems. Well, then the 
Woodlands and Las Colinas will probably be our two

17:39.173 --> 17:45.279
best examples. But one of the interesting 
questions I ask myself occasionally when I think

17:45.379 --> 17:59.613
about planning development in Texas, 
particularly now that the state is in a definite

17:45.379 --> 17:59.613
period of economic crisis, which I do not think is 
going to recover from any time soon. But I see this

18:00.093 --> 18:02.716
as the new beginning for Texas, the second coming. 
The first one was in 1878 when the Reconstruction

18:02.736 --> 18:09.062
ended. but we're going to have to go through a new 
one here you know the question is

18:09.397 --> 18:37.918
who if you look at the the criteria and objectives 
of major corporations who either expand in Texas

18:09.397 --> 18:37.918
or want to move from out of Texas into Texas which is 
the minority most of our Growth comes from

18:38.185 --> 18:40.988
internal expansion. Who wants to go to Houston? 
Who's going to want to live in Houston? Who is going

18:47.236 --> 18:50.760
to want to live in Dallas after a certain point? 
Neither one of them have much in the way of

18:50.780 --> 18:52.703
character. Austin, unfortunately, as I said 
earlier, is fast destroying its own character. It

19:02.214 --> 19:03.736
was stopped 10 years ago. 10 years ago would have 
been a great time, or at least gotten it under

19:04.177 --> 19:07.821
control then. And

19:07.936 --> 19:35.631
again, I guess I'm sounding redundant, but I do not 
see anything happening of a positive nature

19:07.936 --> 19:35.631
that's going to really redirect

19:07.936 --> 19:35.631
money and heritage in Texas towards improving and 
creating better urban environments that are

19:07.936 --> 19:35.631
going to be really on par with the other ones 
nationally that we could talk about. until the

19:36.033 --> 19:45.006
state makes a commitment, and the state gets into 
it, and the state starts calling some hard shots.

19:46.128 --> 19:47.970
Well, that's where the authority is. That's where 
the authority is. Governmentally, and that's

19:49.533 --> 19:51.656
where the power is. It's got to happen there. Of 
course, Haley's book is wonderful on that point,

19:53.999 --> 19:59.067
Land Use and the States. It's one of my favorite 
books. Well, I agree that, and I think the chances

20:04.079 --> 20:17.954
of it happening are very, very remote unless we go 
through a crisis that shakes, literally, the

20:04.079 --> 20:17.954
foundations of state government. Well, I think 
we've seen now that state government has had to

20:17.974 --> 20:29.967
come to grips with the idea that we're inferior, 
that we have an inferior situation with respect to

20:17.974 --> 20:29.967
public education. And that is magnified, or 
should be magnified, if it isn't in their minds by

20:29.987 --> 20:33.951
the fact that the what's been called the rebirth of 
the Northeast Corridor, the resurgence of the

20:34.572 --> 20:51.271
Northeast and some of the northern Midwestern 
cities is there because of the underlying

20:34.572 --> 20:51.271
strength that they have, not only in their 
industrial base, but in their educational base.

20:51.371 --> 20:51.972
Absolutely. Now, Texas, I think, has been priding 
itself over a number of years about its natural

20:52.312 --> 21:03.465
advantages.

21:03.766 --> 21:09.916
Mainly most people, when they said that, were 
talking about oil and not thinking about

21:03.766 --> 21:09.916
education or people. It's a rude awakening.

21:15.544 --> 21:16.386
It's going to have to be faced. But I really think 
until the state faces up to the fact that it's going

21:16.406 --> 21:31.950
to have to create a climate for investment, which 
is going to have to pay attention to not only

21:16.406 --> 21:31.950
education, But all the other things that are 
important to companies that are expanding and

21:32.386 --> 21:46.002
people want to live in a place, including what our 
cities are like, we're going to find ourselves in

21:32.386 --> 21:46.002
an increasingly disadvantageous position in the 
entire nation. And we have so much going for us. We

21:51.548 --> 21:52.309
have a coast. We have mineral resources. We have a 
lot of things. surface resources, people

22:00.095 --> 22:05.583
resources, but we're going to lose more of our 
people resources. We're going to see, I wouldn't

22:05.643 --> 22:24.771
be surprised to see, over the next 10 years, see a 
lot of out-migration of people from Texas to other

22:05.643 --> 22:24.771
places who should stay here to the benefit of the 
state, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that

22:05.643 --> 22:24.771
include a number of educators. Oh, I will. I don't 
know how A&M can recruit New faculty, when they

22:29.018 --> 22:37.168
can't provide CICLEAP, for example, CICLEAP is no 
longer available to faculty unless you're on a

22:29.018 --> 22:37.168
12-month appointment. And normally those go only 
to administrators. Well, as the people in my

22:40.672 --> 22:51.486
current industry would say, the real estate 
industry would say, well, that's just not

22:40.672 --> 22:51.486
competitive in the market.

22:55.170 --> 22:58.114
Two years ago, I remember... What time are you 
supposed to be? Oh, about 6 o'clock. Well, it's now

22:59.714 --> 23:00.695
6.20. Oh, it came on very good. We can delay that 
part of the thing. Just taking a look now at this

23:08.184 --> 23:17.215
bill,

23:08.184 --> 23:17.215
you are currently in development. You have always 
been in the private sector of planning and

23:18.096 --> 23:23.843
education. Right. and worked with the chapter 
here, and so forth, and with the educational

23:24.841 --> 23:30.828
foundation. I was also on the AIP board of 
examiners at one time. I forgot about that. Yeah,

23:35.152 --> 23:39.177
you were in charge of the professional 
development committee with the chapter. I

23:39.197 --> 23:43.602
forgot, and it's been a long time.

23:43.702 --> 23:54.814
I'm currently doing what I thought I wanted to do 10 
years ago, and I manage and am in charge of a real

23:43.702 --> 23:54.814
estate development company. that's based in 
Dallas and owned by a Canadian family. We have

24:01.707 --> 24:08.096
significant resources and I can call a lot of 
shots. I can make decisions on what we do, where we

24:08.977 --> 24:14.184
do it, when we do it, and how we do it. And that's 
something that I would never be able to do if I were

24:15.186 --> 24:24.058
at this stage in my life in Texas in a planning 
situation. as a governmental planner? Well, as a

24:27.045 --> 24:30.651
governmental planner or as a consultant.

24:31.873 --> 24:41.769
My experience is that cities don't ordinarily 
listen any more to consultants than they do to

24:31.873 --> 24:41.769
their own staff. So I hate to sound so disparaging 
about it, but I wish we had some more Marvin

24:41.789 --> 24:51.565
Springers around to fight the battles.

24:53.114 --> 25:05.433
Marvin used to take on the opponents at planning 
the way he probably, with the same attitude he had

24:53.114 --> 25:05.433
when he was a tank commander under Patton at the 
Battle of the Bulge. And Marvin is, you know, we

25:05.453 --> 25:20.877
don't have any

25:05.453 --> 25:20.877
Marvin Springers that I'm aware of in planning in 
public positions in the state of Texas right now. I

25:21.515 --> 25:28.706
don't know whether none have been made in the 
intervening period or what's going on, or we're

25:21.515 --> 25:28.706
not attracting them. I do know, I will say that when 
the

25:31.410 --> 25:50.779
city of Dallas was looking, after Alden Dale left, 
when the city of Dallas back during that period of

25:31.410 --> 25:50.779
time was looking for a planning director, and I 
went to AIP conferences and tried to help them drum

25:31.410 --> 25:50.779
up interest, they couldn't get any interest from 
them. from what I would consider to be highly

25:51.653 --> 25:54.878
credible people. Part of that, in all fairness, 
was tied into the Kennedy assassination

25:55.759 --> 26:11.842
and people saying, who wants to go to a city that 
kind of has that atmosphere, which I think was kind

25:55.759 --> 26:11.842
of unfair. But it would be interesting to do a 
survey of planning directors and see how many of

26:11.902 --> 26:20.614
them if they were given the opportunity, I mean the 
top ones, would come to Texas.

26:29.387 --> 26:42.607
Because most of them probably undoubtedly are 
smart enough to realize that without the state

26:29.387 --> 26:42.607
umbrella of support and mandate, that they're in a 
very weak position to accomplish much. They're on

26:42.827 --> 26:44.049
their own. And they're on their own with people who 
are elected to city councils, for example, and

26:49.096 --> 27:01.018
other elected positions who share the philosophy 
or the attitude that created that situation at the

26:49.096 --> 27:01.018
state level. So as you can tell, I'm not overly 
optimistic. No. Bill, I want to thank you very much

27:07.791 --> 27:10.716
for the interview. And we'll get this 
transcribed, and then I'll give it a pre-edit and

27:11.084 --> 27:19.263
get it back to you for your review and comment. 
Fine. Thanks again. Thank you.
