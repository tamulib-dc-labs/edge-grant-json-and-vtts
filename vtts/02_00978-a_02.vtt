WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:05.526
within their rights to protest rules and 
regulations they felt were unfair? Yes, I think it

00:06.047 --> 00:09.730
has to be done in an orderly fashion. There's 
procedure and machinery that should be in place in

00:09.951 --> 00:24.166
all the colleges and universities for students, a 
mechanism for them to protest. Yes, they're the

00:24.766 --> 00:30.072
consumers, and if there's something that they 
think ought to be changed, ought to be a way

00:30.811 --> 00:41.086
provided for them to force those complaints. And, 
of course, this is what the student deans are

00:41.847 --> 00:49.678
supposed to do. That's a part of the function is to 
look after the interests of the students. And a

00:54.765 --> 00:59.772
student ought to be able to go to the dean's office a 
staff member of the dean's staff with a complaint,

01:00.190 --> 01:10.540
and there ought to be a mechanism for addressing 
it. In some instances, it can get turned away and

01:11.380 --> 01:15.364
said, don't worry about that. But if the staff 
members are doing the job, they're listening. But

01:20.228 --> 01:27.295
of course, the activist movement, the 
demonstrations They were taking a rather radical

01:27.933 --> 01:42.370
way procedure for getting themselves hurt, but it 
was probably the only mechanism they had.

01:42.390 --> 01:55.105
So I think it caused universities to stop and take 
notice and see what changes they need to make to

01:42.390 --> 01:55.105
provide the freedoms that can be accorded to 
students within the university structure. And

02:04.708 --> 02:09.855
there are many rules and regulations that get on 
the books and just stay there and stay there and

02:04.708 --> 02:09.855
stay there. If somebody doesn't come along and 
question them, protest

02:10.476 --> 02:21.650
them. And of course the labor unions used strike. 
When they're not getting their way, they'd walk

02:27.079 --> 02:32.207
off the job and strike. Of course, we know some of 
the ills that have befallen the business and labor

02:33.168 --> 02:45.427
as a result of that, but that's another topic. But 
yes, the students have a right, a right to protest.

02:52.122 --> 03:01.936
Some of the protests resulted in violence, but not 
very much of it on the university campus. There was

03:02.096 --> 03:05.240
very little violence. There was some,

03:05.260 --> 03:14.814
and the students' organization could invite 
whomever they wanted to to come and speak. We had

03:15.795 --> 03:19.260
Abby Hoffman on the campus, and that was a big 
gathering. and lots of people there, and this was,

03:19.966 --> 03:47.256
I'm supposing that this may well have been 
sponsored by the Students for the Democratic

03:19.966 --> 03:47.256
Society, I'm not sure, but then Stokely 
Carmichael came to the campus, and these were

03:19.966 --> 03:47.256
pretty tense times when we'd have the large 
gathering, and of course one of my concerns, and I

03:19.966 --> 03:47.256
expressed it, so someone finally gave me an answer 
that satisfied me, I was saying that the trouble

03:48.873 --> 03:56.061
with these big gatherings on the campus, you don't 
know whether you're looking at students or

03:48.873 --> 03:56.061
non-students. Some of the people that get there 
are maybe from across the country or east coast to

03:56.802 --> 04:05.911
the west coast and all around. And you don't know 
what they may be bringing to the campus and

04:06.772 --> 04:13.960
encouraging the students to do. And I said that, 
blessed that, several times. And I remember I

04:17.404 --> 04:18.525
started to do it. looked at him and said, the 
students know whether they're students or not.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.553
They know who's on the campus. And that was a little 
bit comforting. Mickey

04:29.357 --> 04:38.710
Leland, an activist from Houston, was on the 
campus several times. And he addressed campus

04:39.791 --> 04:47.922
groups on the campus and he was active in the 
Students for a Democratic Society causes on our

04:48.340 --> 04:56.971
campus.

04:59.455 --> 05:02.399
But I think the students have a right to protest. 
They have a right to hear whether they want to hear.

05:13.687 --> 05:36.010
Al Kauff was on the campus one time, you know, he's 
the creator of Little Abner, and he made a speech to

05:13.687 --> 05:36.010
the students at the student center, and he said 
having the students run the university was like

05:13.687 --> 05:36.010
having the inmates run the asylum. He wasn't very 
strong student government, student running the

05:36.030 --> 05:43.238
university.

05:44.146 --> 06:05.813
I think that, from my perspective, that many of the 
people from the Regents down through the

05:44.146 --> 06:05.813
administration down to our staff level, I think 
many of them saw the need for some changes that were

05:44.146 --> 06:05.813
being pointed out by the protest movement. And the 
changes have been made. And I think it is a better

06:09.197 --> 06:13.242
climate. and protects all the students' rights 
better. And of course what happens is many times

06:21.167 --> 06:41.490
the activists, the protesters, have a pretty 
narrow focus and it doesn't include the needs of

06:21.167 --> 06:41.490
all the students, but most of them broad enough to 
be good causes. Okay. Okay, could discuss in loco

06:51.281 --> 07:02.172
parentis on the campus and— Well, that's a—it'd 
take a long time to discuss it much. I guess

07:02.372 --> 07:10.600
traditionally and historically, our parents 
sent their students to the colleges and

07:02.372 --> 07:10.600
universities with the expectation that they 
would be looked after, they would be counseled,

07:11.018 --> 07:22.932
they would be required to do certain things. And so 
the tradition grew up that school officials,

07:22.952 --> 07:34.565
college and university officials, were going to 
take the place of the para when they left home. They

07:35.426 --> 07:39.270
were going to monitor their conduct, they were 
going to discipline them when they were out of

07:39.790 --> 07:41.993
line. They were going to send reports back home and 
let them know how Johnny and Mary were doing. But in

07:53.009 --> 08:08.110
the climate that existed in the 60s and 70s,

07:53.009 --> 08:08.110
the students didn't want the university to be the 
papa and the mama. They didn't want them to serve a

08:09.963 --> 08:14.508
surrogate role of the parent. And so the 
university, for several reasons, got out of the

08:14.528 --> 08:26.900
supervision of off-campus housing. The 
fraternities and sororities were moved off of the

08:29.343 --> 08:32.746
campus. And

08:34.768 --> 08:39.413
just in general, The life of the student when they 
walked on the campus was the regulations applied

08:40.068 --> 08:48.578
when they were on the campus. If they left the 
campus to go to Galveston or to Corpus Christi or

08:49.619 --> 09:03.414
somewhere,

08:49.619 --> 09:03.414
that was between them and the legal authorities. 
There was the term double jeopardy that students

09:03.434 --> 09:08.640
used to say that They went downtown and got drunk 
and got put in jail. They paid a fine and got out of

09:13.202 --> 09:17.589
jail. That ought to be it. But old regulations 
provided that when you answered to the civil

09:20.353 --> 09:28.986
authorities, you had to answer to the university 
as well. A violation in town was a violation of

09:29.007 --> 09:33.834
university regulations. And when I first went 
there, We dealt with students, their conduct off

09:36.953 --> 09:42.640
campus as well as on campus. We were required to by 
the regulations, but then it was determined and

09:42.660 --> 09:55.115
decided that surely that was not our area. We 
wanted them to be good citizens. We wanted them not

09:58.979 --> 10:04.446
to violate the law, but we didn't want to dictate to 
them that much about their private lives. So

10:08.825 --> 10:15.592
that was a relief to get out of that. Yet, as I said 
earlier, you give up something, you get

10:15.652 --> 10:22.398
something, and you give up something. You get that 
freedom and you give up a certain amount of

10:22.939 --> 10:34.770
protection and buffering and so on that 
well-meaning, compassionate staff member at the

10:35.172 --> 10:43.900
University College of the University can 
provide. Some of the, I think some of the greatest

10:44.381 --> 11:04.200
members I have about my association with students 
at the University is where someone's student has

10:44.381 --> 11:04.200
touched my life or I've touched somebody's life 
and it became a, it's become a a lifetime feeling

11:04.788 --> 11:10.535
and a relationship that exists. You don't tell 
students what to do and what they can do and what not

11:11.417 --> 11:23.232
to do, but you share with them some thoughts of what 
might happen if you do this and what might happen if

11:11.417 --> 11:23.232
you do that. And many students appreciate it. 
There was one student that came in the store when we

11:27.998 --> 11:34.727
were down at Buda in the antique store And I heard 
his voice, and I thought, George, I believe I've

11:35.467 --> 11:42.956
heard that voice before. And after a while, I said, 
I think I know you. He said, yes, Dean Franks. He

11:49.004 --> 11:53.349
says, you suspended me from the university. I 
said, I did. And I said, OK. Now I know what it was

11:56.253 --> 11:59.917
about. He had forged a letter to the Dean of Arts and 
Sciences his friend who had gone, he belonged to

12:05.268 --> 12:12.836
the Hare Krishna organization. There was funny 
looking haircuts and maybe a long flowing kind of a

12:12.916 --> 12:20.725
robe. They've shown pictures of him at the 
airports and other places like that. But anyhow,

12:26.972 --> 12:34.380
she'd gone to a national meeting and he forced a 
letter to the dean that she was Her grandmother

12:34.917 --> 12:41.227
died, and she'd gone on to be with her grandmother. 
Well, it was found out that she hadn't done that,

12:41.247 --> 13:00.958
and he was brought before me, and he admitted to 
forging the letter, and I had sold it, and I said,

12:41.247 --> 13:00.958
well, I can take you to a committee and let you plead 
your case before a committee, or I'll offer you

12:41.247 --> 13:00.958
suspension from the university for a year. He 
said, well, I'll take the suspension from the

13:02.288 --> 13:05.231
university. So he signed a piece of paper. And I 
said, well, are you still associated with the

13:08.454 --> 13:12.258
organization? He said, no. I was on the West Coast. 
I had a district out there in Oregon or Washington

13:18.044 --> 13:23.089
somewhere. He represented the organization in 
that area. Had a national meeting in New York. And

13:29.955 --> 13:31.637
he went to New York. He'd met his mother and dad 
there, and they had dinner together, and he was

13:32.309 --> 13:47.429
having a night meeting that night, and so he said 
his dad looked at the watch and said, Son, you'd

13:32.309 --> 13:47.429
better go now if you're going to make your meeting. 
He said, I'm not going. And then he went ahead and

13:51.435 --> 13:59.025
told me that his folks had pleaded with him to get 
out of the organization, but had given up on him.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.681
and getting out of the organization. They were 
just going to go ahead and love him anyhow, but he

14:00.741 --> 14:08.989
saw that he shouldn't be doing that. He should get 
out of the organization. Well, that was that kind

14:12.312 --> 14:26.025
of a personal relationship that you can establish 
with a student, even when you're disciplined. The

14:27.507 --> 14:39.224
discipline itself should have some, I'll use such 
a word as curative value, it should have some

14:27.507 --> 14:39.224
value. And of course it can be misused, and I'm sure 
I made some mistakes in some of the decisions I made

14:40.066 --> 14:46.815
relative to students. But I

14:47.737 --> 14:56.029
would be a strong advocate for the schools, 
college and university, having rules and

14:56.397 --> 15:22.168
regulations that are fair, apply to all students 
equally, but the expectations are such that when

14:56.397 --> 15:22.168
you come to be a part of us, you're going to give up 
some of your freedom that you have if you're just

14:56.397 --> 15:22.168
out in the community doing your own thing. You have 
to have requirements about grade point average.

15:28.644 --> 15:35.933
And of course, the professors usually do the 
determination about attendance in class. Some

15:37.876 --> 15:40.739
professors say, three absences and you're out. 
Some fellows say, six absences and you're out. And

15:45.085 --> 15:48.449
some people say, don't miss my class unless you're 
sick. So in the classroom, there's a a lot of

15:53.570 --> 15:59.237
freedom for the professor to make decisions such 
as that. But academic freedom doesn't grant the

15:59.257 --> 16:09.989
freedom to be wrong, whether it's the dean or the 
professor, or whatever it is. Well, I guess that

16:12.272 --> 16:21.703
in local parentage business, parents bring their 
young college students to the university with the

16:22.122 --> 16:31.092
expectation that there's going to be somebody 
there that'll kind of help look after them. And

16:31.112 --> 16:36.237
maybe that that's just an old throwback that's 
still lingering with me. I saw 31 freshman classes

16:36.818 --> 16:41.322
in the universities. I participated in many of the 
orientation programs. And to this day, I forget

16:46.308 --> 16:51.353
how excited and scared parents and the students 
are when they start at the university. Whether you

16:56.192 --> 17:21.137
remember some of your own experiences, the 
university is a big old world, you know, and you

16:56.192 --> 17:21.137
need somebody that

16:56.192 --> 17:21.137
will show an interest, offer some guidance and 
counseling and information that will make them

16:56.192 --> 17:21.137
feel at home. feel comfortable. Well, we still 
need colleges and universities that have

17:24.352 --> 17:42.789
organizations and staff members that are there to 
try to help the student wade through the academic

17:24.352 --> 17:42.789
waters, social and academic.

17:46.832 --> 17:52.137
Much freedom we can't afford them, but with some 
guidelines Okay, now

17:53.078 --> 18:05.291
if you would, discuss any of the Pacific protest 
movements that you remember. Yes, I just thought

18:06.412 --> 18:08.594
about another one. There was an incident that took 
place up on the campus resulting from some trees

18:08.634 --> 18:21.448
being prepared to take down on the campus. make 
room for an addition to the Memorial Football

18:21.783 --> 18:29.532
Stadium. The university administration and the 
regents had done some studies about whether to

18:29.552 --> 18:51.537
move the stadium off of the campus or to enlarge it 
in its present location, and it was decided that it

18:29.552 --> 18:51.537
would be best to enlarge the capacity of it right 
there on the campus. And in order to do that, the

18:52.141 --> 18:58.149
trees along Walla Creek, many trees, had to come 
down. And as soon as word was out that the trees had

18:59.230 --> 19:20.798
to come down in order to make room for the stadium, 
several individuals and groups, and I suppose

18:59.230 --> 19:20.798
that the Students for Democratic Society could be 
given the credit for organizing a protest there.

19:26.156 --> 19:34.348
It didn't have to be them, it could have been any of 
the students who were interested in saving the

19:26.156 --> 19:34.348
trees. Anyhow, the protest was planned. The day 
came when the trees were to come down.

19:43.601 --> 19:49.890
My staff and I were there to observe what was going 
on. heard the bulldozers as they cranked up. We saw

19:54.197 --> 19:59.205
the students as they placed their bodies between 
the bulldozers and the trees. We saw other

19:59.966 --> 20:04.773
students who climbed the trees.

20:08.578 --> 20:19.354
Most of them were talked down, helped down from the 
trees by the university police, but one little

20:08.578 --> 20:19.354
girl got up how up and out on a pretty good size limb, 
and was just balancing herself up there. And the

20:27.005 --> 20:33.011
police tried to talk her into coming down, but she 
wouldn't come down. So one of the university

20:33.792 --> 20:49.206
policemen climbed the tree with a rope and tied it 
around the young woman's waist and brought her

20:33.792 --> 20:49.206
down safely and sound. And Mr. Irwin had been, I 
guess, on the scene pretty early. He was there by

20:57.093 --> 21:00.837
the time I got there, and I was there pretty early 
that morning. He was directing what was going on.

21:05.683 --> 21:09.528
He was telling the bulldozers which trees to get 
next. And so there was a great deal of scampering

21:10.329 --> 21:16.797
around. came to me and said, is that Mr. Irvin over 
there? And I said, yes. He says, it's all right if I

21:21.824 --> 21:24.848
go and talk to him. I said, I'm not taking 
appointments for Mr. Irvin. So he went and visited

21:30.535 --> 21:37.284
with Mr. Irvin a little bit, and then he came back 
just as angry as he could be. He said, you know what

21:38.085 --> 21:40.167
he said to me? And I said, no, what did he say? I told 
him I didn't think those trees ought to come down,

21:46.898 --> 21:59.473
and he told me in no uncertain terms and with a 
little profanity, he didn't give a damn what I

21:46.898 --> 21:59.473
thought. So the trees came down, some of them 
pushed over, and most of the people, many of the

22:00.514 --> 22:15.572
people had walked away at this time, but enough 
People stayed around to get, oh, I don't know,

22:15.856 --> 22:29.216
three or four pretty good-sized trees and dragged 
them by hand up on the campus and propped them up on

22:15.856 --> 22:29.216
the steps of the main building. And there was a 
meeting going on inside of the president and some

22:29.256 --> 22:37.969
of his staff and maybe some of the regents. I don't 
know exactly who was in that. My staff member and

22:41.073 --> 22:45.660
good friend Ed Price was on the inside of the 
meeting, observing what was going on up there, and

22:46.045 --> 23:04.781
I was working the outside, and he heard somebody 
say that, uh, I want those, uh, I want those people

22:46.045 --> 23:04.781
that brought those trees up there arrested and put 
in jail. And the, Dr. Hackerman was our president

23:04.801 --> 23:15.310
at that time, and Dr. Hackerman stood up and had an 
envelope in his hand, and he laid it down on the, uh,

23:15.863 --> 23:21.608
desk and said, gentlemen, I don't want those 
students arrested. And they said, if they are

23:22.349 --> 23:27.293
arrested, go help bring in the trees up to the 
steps. This is my resignation in this envelope

23:28.894 --> 23:34.239
right here. Well, they didn't get arrested. And so 
the president didn't have to tender his

23:36.621 --> 23:41.225
resignation. But I thought it was a great show of 
courage on the part of the president to say, don't

23:45.091 --> 23:50.198
want him arrested. Matter of fact, that I saw the 
administration lean over backwards several

23:50.939 --> 24:07.802
times to keep from just grabbing somebody up, 
hauling off the campus under arrest.

24:11.367 --> 24:11.908
And there was a Maybe I mentioned the sit-in in the 
truck wagon where the tires were sliced. I think I

24:17.008 --> 24:19.230
mentioned that. But I believe those incidents 
involving a considerable number of students and

24:19.250 --> 24:31.683
non-students and whomever wanted to 
participate. And I have to say that there were a

24:32.664 --> 24:41.153
number of faculty members that were in sympathy 
with the movements that the SDS organization was

24:41.943 --> 24:57.721
advocating that moved to make some changes in 
university policy and regulation. And some of

24:58.662 --> 25:10.296
them were faithful in their attendance at 
demonstrations, whether it was at the Pink Lounge

24:58.662 --> 25:10.296
or whether it was downtown for a street 
demonstration. They were taking part in it. I

25:22.678 --> 25:39.102
guess if you were to study and analyze a little bit 
the organization of a university, you've got

25:22.678 --> 25:39.102
people all the way from one end of the continuum to 
the other, from left to right. liberals and

25:39.537 --> 25:43.061
conservatives, and some radicals. And I guess as a 
professor at Indiana said, and then the

25:44.763 --> 25:55.535
university said one time in class, they said, 
well, we've got some kooks here. Every university

25:55.976 --> 25:59.219
campus has some. But it takes a few kooks to keep the 
rest of us straight. Well, kooks is not a good word.

26:05.266 --> 26:06.928
It's a negative word. But it takes people. People 
don't have to hold the same ideas to get along. As a

26:14.409 --> 26:21.498
matter of fact, the university is a place to be 
exposed to a lot of different philosophies and

26:14.409 --> 26:21.498
ideas. And so

26:22.539 --> 26:34.315
I'm thinking about it after what, 20-some years, I 
reckon. And my thinking may not be as clear as it was

26:37.469 --> 26:41.454
when I left the campus. But I left with a good 
feeling that I'd had the experience of being

26:41.475 --> 27:05.788
associated with a university of that size, of its 
magnitude in academic programs and activities,

26:41.475 --> 27:05.788
and there was a great spirit that

26:41.475 --> 27:05.788
permeates the campus. Many of the people that were 
protesting in the 60s and 70s are now the

27:06.629 --> 27:16.480
executives in business and professional 
organizations.

27:20.665 --> 27:24.730
I believe that's all about them, that I have to say. 
And I can't think of any other

27:25.771 --> 27:33.480
large incident

27:44.615 --> 27:45.277
You're trying to.
