WEBVTT

00:04.402 --> 00:09.410
Today we'll have a discussion with Dr. John Eddy of 
Denton, Texas. The date is April 7th, 1984. Today

00:13.477 --> 00:23.693
we'll be discussing the Civil Rights Movement 
during the 50s and 60s and Dr. Eddy's involvement

00:13.477 --> 00:23.693
in the activities that went on.

00:34.456 --> 00:50.444
Could you give a general background of your 
upbringing and how you ended up getting involved

00:34.456 --> 00:50.444
in the civil rights

00:34.456 --> 00:50.444
movement? The sources of my involvement in the 
So-called civil rights movement in the United

00:58.705 --> 01:27.818
States in the 1960s

00:58.705 --> 01:27.818
and 70s comes logically out of the United States 
Constitution, which I studied in the public

00:58.705 --> 01:27.818
school systems of the United States, namely in one 
small high school in Great School, Howard Lake,

00:58.705 --> 01:27.818
Minnesota.

01:30.532 --> 02:00.336
As I pursued my work in college and graduate 
school, in particular studying both science and

01:30.532 --> 02:00.336
theology, I began to realize the roots of our 
culture and Judeo-Christian heritage were

01:30.532 --> 02:00.336
support documents for the U.S. Constitution. the 
understanding that all men are held equal in the

02:02.172 --> 02:28.821
eyes of God and supposedly in the eyes of each other 
were the basis for my action and attitudes which

02:02.172 --> 02:28.821
really helped me participate in the movement with 
full understanding that neither the

02:31.180 --> 02:56.007
Judeo-Christian heritage nor the U.S. 
Constitution was being practiced in our society,

02:31.180 --> 02:56.007
that there was a great gap between the rhetoric of 
the Bible and the Constitution and the actual

02:56.611 --> 03:20.322
practice of our people in accepting one another as 
equals in the area of education, economic

02:56.611 --> 03:20.322
opportunity,

02:56.611 --> 03:20.322
race, and religious practice. Growing up in Power 
Lake, Minnesota, when was your first contact with

03:25.619 --> 03:27.181
peoples of another race?

03:30.344 --> 03:54.107
Well, while our community was predominantly what 
you might call Anglo-Saxon, white, and

03:30.344 --> 03:54.107
Protestant, although there were a significant 
number of Catholics,

03:30.344 --> 03:54.107
there were things that were happening in my life 
because of the fact that I lived in America, and

03:54.290 --> 04:01.717
America was involved in the world. While I was born 
in 1932 in the throes of the Depression, we had all

04:01.757 --> 04:22.255
the mass media occurring around, and I was aware of 
what was happening in the world by listening to

04:01.757 --> 04:22.255
radio and television, which occurred during the 
time I was going to school, which made us aware of a

04:23.585 --> 04:36.346
lot of things, World War II, and then following 
that, the Korean War, development of human rights

04:23.585 --> 04:36.346
and statements in the United Nations. All of that 
was occurring while I was in grade school and high

04:37.287 --> 04:42.335
school. So these were big events in the life of 
anyone who lived during that time. We had lots of

04:51.091 --> 05:16.373
idealists in the state of Minnesota who were 
primary people who helped create the United

04:51.091 --> 05:16.373
Nations, such as Harold Stassen, who was the 
youngest governor, I believe, in the history of

04:51.091 --> 05:16.373
America, who was our youngest governor of 
Minnesota, and he was a primary mover in the whole

05:16.960 --> 05:20.083
Human Rights Movement worldwide. Hubert 
Humphrey was

05:20.323 --> 05:31.074
Mayor of Minneapolis and then Senator in the 
United States Congress and the United States

05:20.323 --> 05:31.074
Senate. And he was an advocate, early advocate of 
human rights and civil rights for all people and

05:46.694 --> 05:55.104
was with the dominant political party at that time 
in America, the Democratic Party. And I would say,

05:55.124 --> 06:15.790
and of course Harold Stassen was a Republican, so 
we had both prominent political leaders in Harold

05:55.124 --> 06:15.790
Stassen and Hubert Humphrey, supporters of civil 
rights, human rights, in both America and in the

05:55.124 --> 06:15.790
United Nations throughout the world. Of course, 
in addition to that, we had other leaders, such as

06:17.795 --> 06:30.096
George McGovern, who was in South Dakota. And of 
course, we had

06:30.116 --> 06:40.714
another senator,

06:46.567 --> 07:15.021
In addition to that we had many other persons in our 
political and religious life in Minnesota who

06:46.567 --> 07:15.021
supported human rights and civil rights

06:46.567 --> 07:15.021
and many of them of course were people who were my 
pastors as well as my Christian friends in the

07:15.710 --> 07:24.240
colleges that I attended, Hamlin University, St. 
Cloud State University, University of

07:24.260 --> 07:27.523
Minnesota. And of course, living only 40 miles 
from Minneapolis and 60 miles from St. Paul, the

07:29.706 --> 07:43.962
capital of Minnesota, I was aware of many of these 
things. In addition to that, my father was an

07:47.243 --> 08:05.425
active person in the politics of Minnesota, and he 
knew, as a Republican, an independent

07:47.243 --> 08:05.425
Republican, he knew Harold Stausen and Hubert 
Humphrey. He was a leader in the Democratic Party.

08:11.893 --> 08:15.197
And so through my father's contacts. I was able to 
meet many of these political leaders who held

08:16.841 --> 08:42.450
strong views on the rights of people and I think 
this fact that I had this kind of background coming

08:16.841 --> 08:42.450
from the state of Minnesota and having a family 
that was interested in human and civil rights,

08:43.612 --> 09:13.045
having a church, United Methodist Church, that 
was a leader then and always has been a leader, the

08:43.612 --> 09:13.045
tradition of John Wesley, who helped, as many 
historians will say, probably helped prevent

08:43.612 --> 09:13.045
England from having the bloody revolution that 
France went through because of the many reforms

08:43.612 --> 09:13.045
that the followers of John Wesley had in terms of 
human and civil rights for the English people. is

09:14.054 --> 09:18.059
part of this background. I go even farther back. 
Some of my relatives were involved in the Magna

09:19.622 --> 09:24.909
Carta against the king. Formation of the Magna 
Carta. This is a family background and out of the

09:28.193 --> 09:39.589
English background that I have in my life.

09:42.505 --> 10:09.694
How did your influence in the Philippines

09:42.505 --> 10:09.694
affect you in this area

09:42.505 --> 10:09.694
when you

09:42.505 --> 10:09.694
returned to the United States? Well, of course, 
when I graduated from the University of Minnesota

10:11.243 --> 10:39.040
in 1954 in landscape architecture, I was prepared 
to go as a short-term voluntary missionary to set

10:11.243 --> 10:39.040
up an agricultural, medical, educational, and 
religious center in Mindanao. at the site which

10:40.522 --> 10:47.712
was called Kitapauan. Interestingly enough, 
that site, again, had some Minnesota

10:47.732 --> 10:52.599
connections. One of the pastors of Wesley, the 
church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, had helped

10:52.799 --> 11:05.196
select the site and gotten the money for the site. 
my campus minister at that time and pastor on the

11:05.851 --> 11:10.798
campus. Wilbur Gross had invited C.L. Spotswood, 
who was the director of this project, to our church

11:14.543 --> 11:29.043
and he was recruiting people when I heard him speak 
and that was why I went out

11:14.543 --> 11:29.043
there. The, again, leadership of the United 
Methodist Church that believes in equality of all

11:30.025 --> 11:35.132
people and incidentally This church has more 
ethnic group members than any other church in

11:35.838 --> 11:45.573
America. We have the widest range of ethnics in our 
United Methodist Church. We're also the first

11:50.560 --> 11:55.688
church to have women bishops, which equality of 
sex for women. They can even hold the highest

11:56.209 --> 11:58.953
leadership in the church. All of this background 
of the disintegration of

12:04.323 --> 12:31.242
segregation in terms of race or color or sex

12:04.323 --> 12:31.242
was my background when I went into the experience 
there in the Philippines and of course there we

12:04.323 --> 12:31.242
worked as a group of young graduates from colleges 
in the United States There were six of us from

12:32.268 --> 12:43.161
America and about 12 people from all over the 
Philippines that worked. And again, it was like

12:43.922 --> 13:00.402
experiencing a multiracial and multicultural

12:43.922 --> 13:00.402
group of Christians who were working together on 
these common problems The people were suffering

13:01.394 --> 13:17.729
from hunger, disease, illiteracy, and also 
religious problems because religion isn't

13:01.394 --> 13:17.729
always a positive experience. Some religions 
induce and convey fears and the leaders keep power

13:17.869 --> 13:29.359
over the people in a way that would keep the people 
under their reign and even keep them ill sometimes

13:29.660 --> 13:40.670
in order to keep that power. So our ministry there 
was truly a manifestation of this whole idea of

13:41.731 --> 13:59.447
treating people equally regardless of their 
background and trying to help them in developing

13:41.731 --> 13:59.447
themselves in positive ways so that they could 
help themselves and not be dependent upon any

14:00.237 --> 14:18.542
group for particular ways that would harm them in 
the future. The experience in the Philippines

14:19.804 --> 14:26.854
helped me see that discrimination is not just in 
America. It's also there in the Philippines. It's

14:28.676 --> 14:30.058
a worldwide phenomenon. It helped me also realize 
what the United Nations Charter idealistically

14:31.456 --> 14:58.847
was trying to do and is still trying to do in trying 
to see all people as people of possibility and

14:31.456 --> 14:58.847
working towards that end in every country to help 
people develop their maximum potential. help

14:59.570 --> 15:10.101
them understand themselves and work in 
relationship to other people who are different in

14:59.570 --> 15:10.101
race, color, creed, background. It also helped me 
work with vastly different religious groups,

15:12.324 --> 15:27.720
whereas I was in a Judeo-Christian culture in the 
United States up until that time, for some 22 years

15:12.324 --> 15:27.720
now, I was working in a predominantly Islamic 
culture. I was secondly working in a culture where

15:33.889 --> 15:37.895
I was in a minority. As a white person, the majority 
were of the brown race, Filipinos. And also that we

15:44.783 --> 15:50.030
had a number of Chinese, Japanese. In other words, 
we had an Asian majority. Third, I was working in a

15:55.612 --> 16:02.739
culture that was primarily non-technological. 
So again, I was a minority here. I'd been in a highly

16:05.582 --> 16:13.770
technological society, and here was primarily 
agrarian society. Fourth, the climate was

16:15.392 --> 16:23.100
different, whereas I was in a climate that was 
predominantly northern. This was a southern

16:25.717 --> 16:30.762
equator, tropical climate. All these, without 
going into further detail, it was a vast change,

16:32.064 --> 16:42.034
and yet I saw the common threads of humanity. No 
matter where we are, there are more things we have

16:43.676 --> 16:54.407
in common amongst people than we have, because we 
all had the same blood type, human blood is a common

16:55.197 --> 17:20.046
factor, and we were all striving to survive in a 
society that had a lot of, and still does, have a lot

16:55.197 --> 17:20.046
of tragic things in its environment.

17:20.066 --> 17:24.411
Coming back from that experience, you felt the 
call to go on into the ministry? Was that, did that

17:28.683 --> 17:44.539
experience,

17:28.683 --> 17:44.539
was that the causal factor in your decision to go 
into the ministry, or you had, had you already

17:28.683 --> 17:44.539
decided that before you left, to go into the 
ministry? Well, I had a call to go into the

17:44.559 --> 17:51.546
ministry, if that's the term you want to use, at 
least I had a commitment to serve people from about

17:53.450 --> 17:59.579
the age of 12 on. I read a book by David Livingston, 
his work in Africa, and this greatly affected my

17:59.739 --> 18:20.149
understanding of what a person's life ought to be, 
and of course there was Livingston was a 19th

18:21.698 --> 18:25.803
century product. But then Elbridge Whiteser

18:25.823 --> 18:34.833
is a continuation of that same philosophy in the 
20th century. And these kinds of people,

18:36.135 --> 18:46.407
extremely talented people, who were not only 
people who were medical doctors but they were

18:47.433 --> 19:17.322
musicians and they were writers and they were 
activists and wanting to improve the world and at

18:47.433 --> 19:17.322
the same time give their talents for others even 
though they probably could have all been

18:47.433 --> 19:17.322
millionaires they would have just stopped and 
concentrated on the things that they had that

18:47.433 --> 19:17.322
would have provided money showed me the kind of 
witness that I think we all need to have if we're

19:17.605 --> 19:43.292
going to have a better world and not just take from 
the world but to give because we've been given so

19:17.605 --> 19:43.292
much in the first place so that I went out with the 
realization that I wanted to serve and continue

19:17.605 --> 19:43.292
and I had the choice either go to seminary or go into 
for the graduate work in agriculture. I had a

19:46.768 --> 19:54.396
fellowship at Iowa State, or I had a fellowship at 
Garrett Theological Seminary. And so I thought

19:55.758 --> 20:08.271
that going to the seminary, I was continuing with 
the same idea of serving. The other thing is, I

20:09.212 --> 20:12.115
realized that while I'd been on the missions field 
and a lot of work there had been very meaningful and

20:13.293 --> 20:29.491
this is a good thing to do, that perhaps the biggest 
mission field in the world was still yet in

20:13.293 --> 20:29.491
America. Because I saw many of the so-called ideas 
in the U.S. Constitution and in the Old Testament,

20:29.511 --> 20:40.043
New Testament, not being practiced, and yet we 
were sending missionaries all over the world, and

20:40.630 --> 20:52.644
yet we were not giving many of our minorities and 
ethnic groups in this country equal opportunity.

20:52.664 --> 21:09.102
In other words, I saw a great gap here in hypocrisy 
between what we said, you know, love thy neighbor

20:52.664 --> 21:09.102
as thyself, and not really doing it in our own 
country And so I saw a greater missing field in

21:09.824 --> 21:16.732
America than I saw in the Philippines or anywhere 
else in the world. And of course I came back and had

21:18.495 --> 21:35.275
some cultural shock because I felt in re-entry 
from the Philippines that I'd met some people in

21:18.495 --> 21:35.275
the Philippines who were deeper Christians and 
many of the people that had sent me out to the

21:35.997 --> 21:40.022
Philippines and who I came back to. I began to 
realize that Christianity, a deep religious

21:40.883 --> 22:00.267
faith, is not the sole possession of any one 
denomination or any one nation or any one person,

21:40.883 --> 22:00.267
but it's universal and that perhaps in some 
countries of the world because people are willing

22:00.888 --> 22:14.988
to sacrifice more for their faith than maybe even 
their own country, that we have much to learn from

22:00.888 --> 22:14.988
people all over the world and not just in America. 
Returning to seminary, what was the attitude in

22:17.431 --> 22:23.740
seminary tours like? What year did you return from 
the Philippines? 1954? Well, I was just there six

22:29.812 --> 22:31.574
months. I left, graduated in May from the 
University of Minnesota, and at that time the

22:31.674 --> 22:54.621
University of Minnesota was the third largest 
university in the United States, and then left

22:31.674 --> 22:54.621
10,000 miles to the Philippines, and I was just 
there from July, or June, to... January.

22:58.778 --> 23:22.330
So I was just there six months, and January of 1955, 
I got back to, and I then took a position as a youth

22:58.778 --> 23:22.330
minister in Wilmer, Minnesota, and served that 
until May, and then took a small church in Wright

22:58.778 --> 23:22.330
County called Greenwood near Buffalo, for that 
summer and then started the seminary in the fall of

23:23.407 --> 23:32.818
1955 as a full-time student.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.541
So what was the... So you were still in the United 
States when the Brown versus the Board of

23:36.722 --> 23:52.941
Education decision came out about doing that 
concerning the separate and equal clause, the

23:36.722 --> 23:52.941
U.S. Supreme Court.

23:54.828 --> 24:02.918
That's what I talked to Mr. Rogers about yesterday 
when he was living at that time in Virginia. What

24:02.938 --> 24:22.303
was the attitude towards the Supreme Court 
decision in the seminary as far as the church

24:02.938 --> 24:22.303
believed in equality, but did any sort of activism 
or support of the need to integrate, to create an

24:23.667 --> 24:26.751
equality that was not separate. Was there 
rumblings of that during your seminary years?

24:30.775 --> 24:35.260
Well, there was this all during that period of time 
in the seminary. There were numbers of us who would

24:35.280 --> 24:50.097
go out to various areas in the Chicago area, where 
we had as much segregation as it was anywhere in the

24:35.280 --> 24:50.097
South, to help integrate different kinds of 
situations. In particular, we saw the school

24:53.821 --> 25:12.685
integration go more smoothly than they, of 
course, were working it in the South, but we saw the

24:53.821 --> 25:12.685
housing integration in the Chicago area to be the 
area where there was the biggest problem. And so we

25:12.785 --> 25:20.134
went out, some of us, and tried to work with some of 
our seminary professors and other church leaders

25:21.683 --> 25:46.206
and others to try to integrate public housing 
along with, and of course it wasn't just housing,

25:21.683 --> 25:46.206
it was integrating, trying to integrate the parks 
and recreational areas and of course all of that

25:21.683 --> 25:46.206
just didn't occur overnight. And that's why when 
Martin Luther came on the scene in the 60s, which

25:46.557 --> 26:00.256
was almost another ten years later, we still 
didn't have all of that accomplished. And that's

26:00.276 --> 26:02.599
why we needed further legislation. That's what 
led the march to Washington. Even with all of the

26:06.745 --> 26:16.058
Supreme Court decision, integration of schools, 
it still didn't affect other areas of society,

26:16.460 --> 26:24.952
such as housing, public accommodations, public 
transportation. People were forced to sit in the

26:25.392 --> 26:43.817
back of the bus, as the slogan or cliche goes, and 
not even drink from public water fountains in

26:25.392 --> 26:43.817
parts

26:25.392 --> 26:43.817
of the South, and so forth. So, in Evanston, where 
you lived, was there any and things like that,

26:47.054 --> 26:51.560
having to sit at the back of the bus. Well, Evanston 
was a bastion of leadership. Of course, the Royal

26:58.390 --> 27:06.221
Consulate Churches had its meeting there about 
the same time. And the leadership of the clergy and

27:06.241 --> 27:14.412
the seminary and the seminary students was 
strong, I would think that at that time that

27:15.455 --> 27:41.010
Garrett Theological Seminary had amongst its, 
and also the pastor of the local church there, or

27:15.455 --> 27:41.010
churches in the plural, that of all communities in 
America, Evanston probably was one of the

27:15.455 --> 27:41.010
strongest communities. Again, I was fortunate to 
In Minnesota,

27:43.450 --> 27:52.922
we had the leadership of Harold Stassen, our 
governor, and Hubert Humphrey, our senator.

27:53.623 --> 28:11.145
Here, the leadership of the seminary professors, 
and we had lots of older seminary students who had

27:53.623 --> 28:11.145
been in World War II and in the Korean War, where 
they had been in integrated

28:11.935 --> 28:34.728
military outfits and where they had also been in 
business industry and medicine and other

28:11.935 --> 28:34.728
professions and they had worked as people who saw 
great leadership. The other thing is a number of my

28:35.590 --> 28:39.175
seminary professors had been in prison camps in 
world war ii i think of don holter who was in the

28:39.307 --> 29:05.247
philippines and i think of my another one 
philosophy professor who was in in the singapore

28:39.307 --> 29:05.247
region and taking courses with them and hearing 
them uh expound on the faith and this this vision of

29:06.678 --> 29:22.834
human rights, even though they had been greatly 
persecuted and even almost died under the

29:06.678 --> 29:22.834
suffering they occurred under the Japanese 
during World War II. It was quite an inspiration.

29:26.698 --> 29:31.162
And of course then we had people studying from all 
over the world. Garrett was the largest Methodist

29:31.502 --> 29:35.166
seminary at that time in the world, and again, the 
Methodist Church being a leader in human rights,

29:36.192 --> 29:57.974
civil rights, and having one of the largest 
missionary programs, not just to send people to

29:36.192 --> 29:57.974
preach the gospel, but to live the gospel, and to 
train people how to live the gospel and preach the

29:36.192 --> 29:57.974
gospel. In a comprehensive program such as I 
mentioned earlier in the Philippines, It was a

30:02.804 --> 30:05.768
real inspiration to me. It supported my feeling 
that this was something I wanted to invest my life

30:05.928 --> 30:16.964
in and to help others. So Evanston was an ideal 
community, just as Minnesota had before been an

30:17.545 --> 30:30.904
ideal state to live in as far as this kind of vision 
that we're talking about, human rights, civil

30:17.545 --> 30:30.904
rights. and practicing them and carrying them 
out. So when did you begin your campus ministry at

30:36.303 --> 30:43.133
Mankato State in Minnesota? Well, I started in 
1960. I was there five years. At the end of the five

30:47.760 --> 30:54.730
years, I had been there longer than any other 
campus ministry in the state of Minnesota. During

30:55.651 --> 30:59.136
that time, we saw the building of a building and 
almost had it paid off by the time I left. I went on to

31:04.619 --> 31:11.425
graduate school at Southern Illinois 
University, following that work. During those

31:11.445 --> 31:13.947
five years, we did many things. Again, I saw some of 
the whole theme. Again, we worked with civil

31:18.311 --> 31:28.600
rights movements in the South, myself, our 
students, going to Mississippi, a number of us

31:29.677 --> 31:36.968
doing different kinds of things, working in 
colleges, working in civil rights, voter

31:29.677 --> 31:36.968
registration. It's quite a paradox and irony. 
Here we have a U.S. Constitution. A lot of people

31:42.537 --> 31:43.498
couldn't vote. They had to pay a poll tax to vote. To 
me, unbelievable and incredible that we would

31:46.843 --> 31:54.435
claim ourselves to be a democracy and not and a 
chance for our people to vote and assert their

31:55.057 --> 31:59.502
democratic rights. And I saw this very definitely 
as a hardcore democracy, and I know that some of our

32:00.683 --> 32:11.374
people that have believed in this have been called 
communists. To me, this is the worst thing in the

32:11.814 --> 32:20.423
world that you could call a true patriot of this 
country, a true democratic. And I'm not talking

32:21.179 --> 32:25.424
about Democratic Party because it's political. 
Political is not a part of it, but it's political in

32:25.444 --> 32:40.181
a sense of the constitutional rights and the bill 
of rights that I'm talking about here, true

32:25.444 --> 32:40.181
patriotism and that kind of democracy. And so that 
kind of thing we did in the campus ministry, plus we

32:40.201 --> 32:50.933
worked in mental hospitals again. early work in 
mental hospitals to make the mental hospitals

32:51.503 --> 33:01.793
more humane along the miniature idea of caring and 
sharing. And so we went into mental hospitals. Our

33:04.616 --> 33:14.606
students, again, I worked with them to make these 
mental patients feel that they were lovable and

33:04.616 --> 33:14.606
usable and to get them out of that institutional 
setting. And I think that was a real breakthrough

33:15.547 --> 33:18.250
that I was involved in. And again, I worked in the 
inner cities. inner city movement to help

33:21.052 --> 33:30.287
revitalize our cities, to make them livable, very 
important thing. And again, Indian reservations

33:31.689 --> 33:44.629
in the rural area, again to work in ways to 
revitalize the rural areas, many of the Indians

33:31.689 --> 33:44.629
suffering from alcoholism, depression. with a 
similar factor in inner city amongst a lot of

33:45.318 --> 33:51.407
people, alcoholism, drug addiction, 
depression. And so I felt during that time that I

33:52.448 --> 34:01.502
was able to do a lot of things that are still needed 
and will always be needed because of the very

33:52.448 --> 34:01.502
nature of our society. And those things helped 
formulate my present concerns and interests that

34:02.503 --> 34:09.493
I continue in some way today.

34:12.578 --> 34:13.519
Well, So some of your students did go on the voter 
registration drives, and was there a sizable

34:14.444 --> 34:32.104
percentage of black students at Mankato State? We 
didn't have too many black students at Mankato

34:32.124 --> 34:43.978
State, but we did have some black students,

34:45.275 --> 34:55.788
Mexican-American students, some 
Asian-American students, and we had a large

34:45.275 --> 34:55.788
number of international students. In other 
words, one doesn't need to have a particular large

34:56.829 --> 35:08.323
American minority if there are other groups. To 
give you this feeling that we need to work on this,

35:08.343 --> 35:13.729
not just in America, but worldwide, this idea 
civil rights, civil freedom, civil rights. The

35:18.885 --> 35:43.480
fact that we took into our home international 
students who felt discriminated in Mankato

35:18.885 --> 35:43.480
because of the color of their skin and because they 
were, quote, foreign, is an indication that,

35:18.885 --> 35:43.480
again, this whole idea that our society It has a lot 
of churches and synagogues and parishes. The

35:48.485 --> 36:00.302
people haven't really gotten the message of 
Jesus, who found discrimination there amongst

35:48.485 --> 36:00.302
the people, amongst the Jewish people. The 
Pharisees, the Zealots, the Sadducees were all

36:00.342 --> 36:08.674
discriminating each other, and yet they were part 
of the same religious group, which is tragic. And

36:09.295 --> 36:30.859
then, of course, there was a great discrimination 
in Jesus' time between the Samaritans and the

36:09.295 --> 36:30.859
people, Jewish people, and, of course, others, 
which indicates the total problem of prejudice

36:09.295 --> 36:30.859
and discrimination is a broad thing. It can happen 
within religious groups as well as within color

36:31.379 --> 36:38.307
groups that are all the same color as well as 
amongst people who had the same so-called

36:39.063 --> 36:44.889
political ideology. When did—you went down to 
Mississippi in the spring of 1963?

36:54.680 --> 37:08.935
Yes, I had an opportunity to be—we arranged an 
exchange between the chaplain of Rust College,

36:54.680 --> 37:08.935
which is the oldest Methodist black college in the 
United States, formed shortly after the Civil

37:09.252 --> 37:15.497
War, 1866.

37:17.119 --> 37:28.729
And incidentally, at the site of which there were 
over 59 different battles fought between the

37:17.119 --> 37:28.729
Confederate or Southern and the Northern or Union 
forces. And the chaplain there came to Mankato. He

37:33.172 --> 37:34.694
lived in our house. We lived in his house. I taught 
the classes he taught. He taught classes that I

37:42.120 --> 37:44.082
taught. He did the work of ministry that I did. I did 
the work of ministry he did. It was that kind of

37:50.371 --> 37:57.041
exchange, and we gained a lot, both of us, in 
understanding. Here was, I was in a predominantly

37:57.862 --> 38:02.148
black group. He was, as a white person, and he as a 
predominantly black was in a

38:07.454 --> 38:17.526
community of predominantly whites. What kind of 
response did you get from black students and

38:19.209 --> 38:24.856
teachers? Well, I received a very warm response 
from the black students and faculty and local

38:24.876 --> 38:36.550
church

38:38.707 --> 38:48.578
From the white people in that community, they saw 
us as

38:38.707 --> 38:48.578
being a problem. We were the nigger lovers. We were 
the carpetbaggers. We were the northern

38:54.305 --> 38:58.090
renegades. We were the people who were there to 
disrupt their environment.

39:07.327 --> 39:25.935
because it meant then if the ideas that we lived and 
believed came into being, that their public

39:07.327 --> 39:25.935
facilities, public transportation, their 
voting systems would be equal to all Americans.

39:25.955 --> 39:35.089
And this was an extreme threat to their 
understanding of what American democracy was all

39:25.955 --> 39:35.089
about. preaching in his church differently, and 
working with their students differently, than

39:35.677 --> 39:45.891
working with the students in Minnesota? Well, 
because Russ College did not have the highest

39:45.911 --> 40:04.215
academic standards that Mankato State 
University had, again because of black students

39:45.911 --> 40:04.215
that had inferior educational opportunities, 
The schools were

40:04.499 --> 40:24.004
not as well integrated, you see, because this was 
ten years after the Brown versus whatever Board of

40:04.499 --> 40:24.004
Education decision. We still didn't see the 
fruits of equal opportunity in education there.

40:34.115 --> 40:42.367
And so I saw that the students just were not as well 
prepared for one thing, orally or written. And on

40:42.767 --> 41:02.215
the other hand, they had a Christian tradition 
that made them kind and more caring than many of the

40:42.767 --> 41:02.215
students in the so-called, in the predominantly 
white university in Mankato. So there are

41:02.768 --> 41:26.937
different kinds of things here because of the 
limitations of education and also the emphasis of

41:02.768 --> 41:26.937
the Southern Church on religion and as a more 
encompassing part of one's life and one's family.

41:28.058 --> 41:29.620
There was a secularization faith, at least in the 
North, and I think it's even more common all over,

41:30.342 --> 41:41.299
was evident. Had the groups at West College 
attempted any sit-ins or other...? The College

41:48.490 --> 41:58.105
was conservative, but individuals in the student 
body were doing things to help create more

41:58.608 --> 42:04.817
democratic options.

42:07.842 --> 42:09.925
It's classed in Memphis, right? Right. Russ 
College was not a center of civil rights activism.

42:20.340 --> 42:24.767
It was probably a very average

42:26.806 --> 42:29.189
conservative black college at that time. Now 
though just a few miles away at the University of

42:30.230 --> 42:55.902
Mississippi we had James Meredith captive in a 
residence hall there and we went over there to

42:30.230 --> 42:55.902
visit and of course army tanks were going around 
the residence hall and troops were marching for

42:30.230 --> 42:55.902
one man to go to school, to protect one man to go to 
school. they had the National Guard out, with

42:56.557 --> 43:25.517
machine guns and tanks, and it was an unbelievable 
display of military power, and again, this just

42:56.557 --> 43:25.517
blew my mind that this could happen in America, and 
I thought about all the history books I'd read in

42:56.557 --> 43:25.517
Minnesota, and all the other things, and how I 
really didn't understand what was happening in my

42:56.557 --> 43:25.517
own country, with the reaction that people had to 
one man who was trying to get an education at a

43:26.223 --> 43:36.134
public university in Mississippi. Now, of 
course, as we look back on that, it seems just very

43:36.154 --> 43:52.872
strange because the outstanding people at the 
University of Mississippi are black athletes who

43:36.154 --> 43:52.872
play on a football team, and they're proud of them 
now. It's such a strange reversal. It's

43:56.071 --> 43:57.453
unbelievable. And this is 1985. That was 1963. And 
of course, in 22 years, that's a big jump from

44:01.718 --> 44:17.880
blacks being denied an education to blacks being 
recruited, going out to try to get the black

44:01.718 --> 44:17.880
athletes so that they can have the best football 
team in the country. And really, things have

44:26.940 --> 44:37.193
changed very much, though, if you think about it, 
because in those situations, the blacks are being

44:26.940 --> 44:37.193
put upon, or used in a way. Well, I agree. I think, 
again, the black athlete is being exploited, so

44:39.536 --> 44:47.226
why? the television can project these games and 
some coaches can win and get big salaries and some

44:47.662 --> 45:02.702
professional teams can use the colleges as 
feeders for their teams. Sure, I see the whole,

45:03.503 --> 45:11.374
when you go back to the gladiator times of the 
Romans and you wonder, you know, what have we done

45:11.978 --> 45:14.481
in 2,000 years. Same kind of crass commercialism, 
bloodthirsty crowds, and callous

45:15.642 --> 45:34.926
kinds of crass commercialism again occurring 
here. And the black athlete has exchanged his

45:35.687 --> 45:40.973
status of a slave picking cotton to a robot running 
down the field.

45:54.795 --> 46:10.909
But at least his status, if he remains healthy, 
doesn't get sucked into drugs and other problems,

45:54.795 --> 46:10.909
is that he might eventually become a person who can 
use his power and influence to make it make this a

46:11.243 --> 46:18.792
better country, maybe more idealistic than 
whatever. But I like to think that some of them

46:18.812 --> 46:31.167
will give back some things and help change this. 
Considering Russ Colleges and Methodist

46:31.187 --> 46:38.997
institution-wide, what was the funding for Russ 
College? Did it come from Methodists?

46:40.522 --> 46:44.136
congregations all over the country, or is it just 
parted?
