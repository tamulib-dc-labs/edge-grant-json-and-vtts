00:01.803 --> 00:13.230
This is an interview with Ms. Rocio Powell by 
Carrie Weber on April 12, 1976, for an oral history

00:01.803 --> 00:13.230
project in Geography 311.

01:08.611 --> 01:13.859
We came to Texas in 19 and 29 from Tennessee. My 
husband worked for the railroad. We came knowing

01:16.382 --> 01:20.408
the opportunities would be better here. We lived 
in Kaufman, TX about 18 months. We came to Groves

01:25.115 --> 01:27.619
back. And live there two years. We came to her and in 
34 her and was slow for progress a while. We had two

01:37.737 --> 01:42.962
schools, elementary and high World War Two came 
on. I had two boys to go in the Navy. They were in the

01:46.186 --> 01:50.350
invasion on Guana Canal and Imajima. We were gone. 
They were gone three years. Come home safe. We have

01:56.937 --> 02:00.200
a new post office now. Used to have one on the old 
building on the corner of 4th. We have. very few

02:07.454 --> 02:10.877
side, we had very few sidewalks. What we had were 
brick. We had a cotton mill, an oil mill, which are

02:13.720 --> 02:18.644
gone now. Very few people had cars. They were Model 
Ts, and now most everybody has a nice car. Our

02:27.092 --> 02:29.815
school system has improved so much. The children 
would go, would come to school at 8 o'clock, get out

02:30.415 --> 02:35.520
at 4, They that lived any distance would bring 
their lunch. We had no hospitals, had one doctor

02:40.213 --> 02:45.319
named Alexander. He died years ago. After the war, 
Dr. Searcy and Dr. Fleming built a little

02:46.781 --> 02:53.229
hospital. Dr. Searcy died, Dr. Boyd and Dr. Gwines 
built the big hospital which we have now, and we are

02:53.790 --> 03:02.380
very proud. We lived On Market Street, we had a 
bench in the corner of our yard. A&M boys would come

03:08.923 --> 03:14.731
and sit on that bench waiting for a ride. That was in 
1940, 42, and 43. I have seen A&M go into a

03:18.696 --> 03:24.545
university. Someday, A&M will be the biggest 
college anywhere. I sent my grandson, John

03:28.876 --> 03:36.844
Pastor, to A&M, which graduated in 75 and is now in 
law school. I am an A&M fan.

03:44.913 --> 03:48.016
I can go back to when you were in Tennessee. You 
taught school there, right? Well, I taught school

03:50.058 --> 03:52.241
in Tennessee. I went to college in Murfreesboro, 
Tennessee. in 1910, 1911, and 1912. And it was

04:00.260 --> 04:04.965
strictly a teacher's college. And I majored in 
English and Home Ec. And today, it's like A&M. Any

04:13.293 --> 04:22.322
field you want to get into to go to teacher's 
college, why, you can get into it, for it covers all

04:23.247 --> 04:30.254
I have one of my friends sent me a picture of it last 
year and it's a big college now. But when I went

04:31.135 --> 04:35.619
there and then I taught school about six months.

04:38.442 --> 04:48.192
And then I quit and then we we came to Texas and but I 
never did teach school here, but I always belong to

04:38.442 --> 04:48.192
the PTA. And I have had children in school ever 
since 19 and 20. And this year, Karen will graduate

04:55.583 --> 04:59.630
from high school here. And I won't have nobody else 
in school. Of course, I guess she'll go to college

05:03.375 --> 05:08.283
somewhere, which John wants her to go to A&M. I 
don't know where she'll go. Did you come from a

05:11.368 --> 05:12.850
large family? Me? No. I had one brother. and one 
sister and my brother's dead i am the only one

05:17.568 --> 05:45.820
that's living in my family and i'm 84 years old your 
husband was with the railroad right and my husband

05:17.568 --> 05:45.820
died in 1970 and all his family is gone in fact my 
children is about all i've got in the relation in

05:17.568 --> 05:45.820
the relative part and uh No, they're all gone. All 
my children, I have five girls and three boys, and

05:49.932 --> 05:54.196
they're all living. Well, what was the main 
industry in Hearn? What was the main industry in

05:59.282 --> 06:02.245
Hearn when you all got here? Cotton, railroading, 
cotton mill and oil mill. Was it wells? I mean, for

06:10.654 --> 06:11.515
the oil. Was it wells or what? No, the oil. See, they 
had the cotton mill. They'd take the cotton seed

06:16.951 --> 06:21.437
and stuff and make oil. And it's all closed up now. 
And then we had the Humboldt and the Texaco people,

06:24.861 --> 06:31.470
you know these tanks you see out here? Well, they 
used to have gasoline and oil in them, and now

06:32.331 --> 06:38.560
there's nothing. When did they come in? Oh, honey, 
I just don't know when they did, because they're

06:40.943 --> 06:45.709
here when I come here. But they've been closed for. 
Oh, I guess 25 years. That's one reason that Hearn

06:52.190 --> 06:55.475
is not. We don't have the best school system in the 
world, and that's why we don't have any money. You

07:02.784 --> 07:12.237
know, it's got a town has got to be prosperous for 
money to pay teachers and we have to have what you

07:02.784 --> 07:12.237
call the. Where they can't get a job nowhere else 
because they don't have the money to pay them. But

07:17.614 --> 07:19.016
we've got no income. But nothing to bring their 
money in. Nothing where taxes would be. Now

07:24.924 --> 07:26.586
railroading. I've seen the day when they would be a 
whole block when they'd get their checks going to

07:27.147 --> 07:34.337
the bank. Now there's 15 or 20 going. And of course 
that brought a resource in for schools. and uh as

07:43.351 --> 08:10.894
well as a hern has never let nothing come in here and 
they didn't couldn't realize what they're

07:43.351 --> 08:10.894
cutting their nose off to spite the face by not 
doing it and you know that the factory over in brian

07:43.351 --> 08:10.894
that i believe is baker shoe factories well they 
wanted here and the city manager wouldn't let them

07:43.351 --> 08:10.894
come here and they went over there and they built 
When they went there, they just had one little

08:11.313 --> 08:15.119
place there on the corner. Well, now they have a 
whole, you know how much, how big it is. That's why

08:19.245 --> 08:23.431
Brian, I have seen Brian grow. They used to, 
between Brian and College Station, that was all

08:24.713 --> 08:30.141
woods.

08:32.865 --> 08:36.130
And you see where he is now, don't you? Because 
that's why Brian is worth so much. And it's

08:39.848 --> 08:43.312
prospered because they have let stuff come in. 
They have built and hung just a town that won't

08:43.412 --> 08:51.340
build or won't let business come in. They're not 
going to get nowhere. That's true. And that's the

08:54.624 --> 08:56.506
way it is here. They just never would let nothing go 
here. Used to, I can remember A&M how it used to be.

09:08.435 --> 09:36.940
that we used to have trains to run through we'd ride 
on you know the agriculture part was over on this

09:08.435 --> 09:36.940
side and the mechanical part was over on that side 
is the old building still over there the

09:08.435 --> 09:36.940
agriculture part i'm not sure which one are you 
referring to i imagine it is i haven't been on that

09:08.435 --> 09:36.940
side and i don't know when but every that's the way 
it used to be that and now who has grown and still are

09:37.747 --> 10:04.885
growing even now john of course finished in three 
years at a m because he went all the time and in that

09:37.747 --> 10:04.885
three years how it has how a m has built and still a 
building in growing and i remember when uh they let

09:37.747 --> 10:04.885
girls start oh they had a woog they didn't and the 
boys didn't want the girls to come and a lot of the

10:06.248 --> 10:32.965
people didn't say it was boys college and let's 
keep it that way but i never could understand why

10:06.248 --> 10:32.965
they didn't want it because the girls had the same 
right to go that the boys did and now why you know

10:06.248 --> 10:32.965
where it is with them they have a well i think that uh 
I think our school system is better all the way

10:33.839 --> 10:46.153
around than it used to be, but it used to be we didn't 
have nothing to do nothing with. That was one

10:47.555 --> 10:48.496
thing. And then another thing, used to nobody, the 
majority of children that went to school, their

10:49.817 --> 10:58.327
parents had money. And now, if you want an 
education, money's not the object. Because

11:03.978 --> 11:06.242
there'll be some way for you to go. If you want an 
education now, it's up to you. Because you can get

11:13.393 --> 11:16.217
the means to go on. Do you think Hearn needs more 
education, I mean a better education system, more

11:18.721 --> 11:25.632
schools? think what you think is her not to improve 
their schools well they would if they could but

11:26.371 --> 11:53.273
they can't they've got nothing to do nothing with 
it takes money takes money to do things our

11:26.371 --> 11:53.273
teachers here well i don't know hardly how they 
live but of course this is not a such a this is just a

11:26.371 --> 11:53.273
country town life because they don't make much But 
then they're glad we've got a very few teachers

11:55.379 --> 12:02.026
that has two degrees. Well, you know now most any 
school, any town, well, they're going to require

12:03.468 --> 12:13.319
that teacher to have two degrees anyhow. Well, we 
have teachers here that don't even have a degree

12:13.339 --> 12:21.428
that substitute teachers. Well, a lot of the 
parents kick about it. But what you going to do?

12:25.034 --> 12:30.182
They haven't got money to hire teachers with to 
hire extra teachers. They're sub teachers. We

12:33.367 --> 12:35.070
have a girl. She's got five children. And she's 
going to A&M now. And she substitutes here

12:41.700 --> 12:44.084
sometimes. She hasn't been to A&M a year. And some 
of the parents are just kicking the wall out about

12:46.567 --> 12:49.572
it. You know, don't want her to teach said she 
wasn't qualified well she just teaches the low

12:52.450 --> 13:19.588
grades she uh one out of high school could teach a 
low grade child in the first grade or kindergarten

12:52.450 --> 13:19.588
or something well i've just been ripped down the 
back because i said we can't get nobody else and i

12:52.450 --> 13:19.588
said let her teach and let her keep on going to a m and 
no we our school system is not the best and that's

13:20.868 --> 13:48.411
why it's money we don't have income to pay teachers 
you know you got to have uh you take brian every way

13:20.868 --> 13:48.411
you turn around now there's something that makes 
that is taxed to make money for the schools for a

13:20.868 --> 13:48.411
certain part of all of it goes to the school It's 
just like with paying anything else. We only have

13:53.320 --> 13:56.083
one highway patrolman here. Of course, he is paid 
by the county, but the city has to pay him so much,

13:56.544 --> 14:02.410
too. But they don't have no money. Poor, poor pay. 
We can get a good policeman here, come in here, and

14:08.035 --> 14:18.146
next thing you know, he's either gone to Byron or to 
Houston or Temple or somewhere. More money?

14:19.795 --> 14:27.183
Because they just don't have their money to do 
with. It takes money to do most anything that's

14:27.343 --> 14:36.012
where you're going to accomplish something. 
You're going to have to have money. It's going to

14:39.295 --> 14:40.857
have to come from somewhere. But let it be honest, 
we're losing a bank here now.

14:49.006 --> 14:52.390
We've had lots of trouble with it. I don't know. 
Well, do you think that Hearn did better when they

14:55.595 --> 15:01.142
had the cotton mills around? Oh, sure. Anytime

15:04.467 --> 15:10.935
with anything, you take like the railroad. My 
husband was yard foreman. And up until about He

15:19.128 --> 15:23.373
retired in 65.

15:25.716 --> 15:32.365
And up until about 60, he worked from 18 to 20 men. 
And when he quit, he had to retire on account of his

15:33.266 --> 15:38.172
health. And then he was working 8 of 10, and now they 
work 4.

15:47.144 --> 15:48.966
And you see all of that. They moved off to different 
places. Some of them, when they'd get cut off, they

15:52.312 --> 15:56.076
were younger men. They'd go somewhere else where 
they could get on. Well, the next day he'd work

15:59.139 --> 16:07.407
three, and maybe this man would have eight or nine 
children. Well, a lot of times I would fix up a big

16:07.427 --> 16:18.497
pan of meal, great big pieces of meat and dried 
beans and send out To that family.

16:22.759 --> 16:24.380
To what you had to. You didn't want him to cry for 
something to eat. And as to us, we had plenty to eat,

16:28.044 --> 16:34.109
a good house to live in, a car to drive and 
everything like that. But the man that was a

16:34.570 --> 16:36.932
working. Why it made it hard on him because he 
helped somebody else. Especially if like we wash

16:43.518 --> 16:47.742
daddy worked there with me and. And you become 
attached to the crew that you're working. And we

16:53.853 --> 17:00.140
just, of course, some of them, they had some men 
that were single. Well, there's all right what

17:00.540 --> 17:02.943
they drew. But you take a man, and especially way 
back then, it seemed like that the black

17:03.483 --> 17:16.817
especially, we had one man that had 11 children. 
And I couldn't see those children cry for hunger.

17:24.287 --> 17:27.430
And, of course, that made it hard then on me. And, of 
course, now people won't call it a depression. But

17:33.216 --> 17:36.760
I don't know what else harder that we are in. 
People, of course, I do think, though, that

17:38.762 --> 17:44.068
people, that times is getting a little bit better. 
It seems like there's more work for people than

17:44.088 --> 17:47.732
there was. For I know about two years ago. There 
wasn't work for nobody and everything high.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.416
Well, I think. That if we can ever get the 
government straightened out.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.331
Why I think times will get better. And I think it's 
up to the people. You know this sitting back and

18:15.318 --> 18:17.702
saying now. I don't know why in the world that we 
don't get a so-and-so, a good governor, a good

18:18.188 --> 18:27.999
president, a good so-and-so in Congress, or do 
this or do that. We'll have to get up and do

18:28.620 --> 18:32.104
something about it. I don't know. They don't do it, 
though. That's true. Do you remember what the

18:36.789 --> 18:38.671
wages were like? What kind of wages the railroad 
was paying back then? Oh, my gracious.

18:47.787 --> 18:55.660
In 1930, in

18:47.787 --> 18:55.660
Grovesburg, people worked for 50 cents a day. Not 
on the railroad. I think the railroad men made

18:58.665 --> 19:03.353
about, of course, daddy was on salary. But then, I 
believe then his salary was $150 a month. But you

19:13.707 --> 19:19.854
could take $10 and go to the grocery store and buy 
enough groceries to last a month. And when he quit,

19:21.616 --> 19:29.305
he was making close to $1,000 a month. Now, that's 
the way it had to come up. But you could get a job

19:33.950 --> 19:41.318
today of making $20 a day. And you could work five 
days at $20. You go to buy something, they know what

19:46.720 --> 19:49.324
you're making. As salary and wages go up, stuff's 
going to go up. So they're going to get your money.

19:56.454 --> 19:59.658
That's just the way the ball bounces. It's always 
been that way, more or less. Especially in recent

20:03.103 --> 20:06.527
years, it's been more so. We had... I had my 
children far apart, but last I had four girls, and

20:12.112 --> 20:27.728
the grown ones called them the little girls, and my 
baby will be 45 years old in September. I used to go

20:29.049 --> 20:34.074
to town, and I'd buy them pair of shoes for $1.98. 
They were shoes, too, like you buy now and give $18,

20:35.515 --> 20:40.060
$20 for it. Well, then the dollar was worth more in 
those days, though, wasn't it? Karen bought her

20:45.834 --> 20:51.662
pair of shoes in Lubbock. They got a sole on them and 
a strap and gave $20 for them.

21:00.112 --> 21:02.936
Well, did you ever have a job other than teaching? 
What? Did you ever have a job other than teaching?

21:06.280 --> 21:08.482
No. I was in college when I married. And I kept 
house.

21:17.618 --> 21:20.662
My baby boy graduated from Sam Houston. And one day 
they were talking in class. And this professor

21:26.509 --> 21:32.936
asked the children what their parents did. And 
they come to Jack and said, Jack, does your mother

21:33.757 --> 21:37.582
work? He said, my mother's got the most important 
job there is in the world. jacks he he was deciding

21:42.967 --> 22:11.218
he said that some of them turned around and looked 
he said what does your mother do he said she is a wife

21:42.967 --> 22:11.218
and my mother

21:42.967 --> 22:11.218
well if you think about it to be a mother it's not 
everybody that has a baby is a mother i know plenty

21:42.967 --> 22:11.218
of people that They've got three or four children, 
but they're getting short. With being like this

22:16.609 --> 22:18.251
should be. And if you are a mother of Christian 
mother and raise children and educator. Why

22:26.782 --> 22:30.647
you've helped the world, you've helped. The 
progress of time for that boy girl. Maybe. All

22:35.813 --> 22:37.255
right, you take it this way. My baby boy. Has three 
degrees. He has BS degree in master. From Sam

22:44.596 --> 22:49.942
Houston and then he has PH degree which he got. He 
went to about five different colleges. And he. Is

22:53.646 --> 23:02.096
over special in education for delinquent boys and 
girls and retardation. He places retarded

23:02.116 --> 23:05.259
children in. Two homes where their parents can't 
take care of him properly. He has a good job.

23:15.030 --> 23:26.201
Well, since he has so much, I mean, has some 
experience in teaching, do you think that the

23:15.030 --> 23:26.201
educational process, I mean, how they teach 
children has changed much? Oh, mercy, yes, and

23:26.221 --> 23:28.283
much better. But let's take the retaliation. Used 
to, if anybody had a retarded child, that child was

23:32.267 --> 23:39.795
kept at home. and a lot of people didn't ever even 
see that child because so many parents i guess they

23:40.889 --> 24:06.745
felt embarrassed that's my notion but now 
retarded children has a chance now just like with

23:40.889 --> 24:06.745
jack he goes into homes these children are in our 
schools here we have a teacher that teaches

23:40.889 --> 24:06.745
retarded children And used to, I know one, 
especially I have a friend that has a girl

24:08.800 --> 24:14.106
retarded. Well, she started that child to school. 
She's as old as Karen. And, of course, you can tell

24:19.572 --> 24:24.478
she's retarded all right enough. But a long time 
ago, when that child started to school, she

24:24.898 --> 24:31.726
couldn't have talk. She didn't know anything. Her 
mother had never taught her nothing. And now she

24:37.792 --> 24:43.161
can read and write, and she's a nice-looking girl. 
Now, and she goes to church regularly. You don't

24:47.087 --> 24:49.431
ever see her talking to anybody. I don't walk up to 
her and I say, Mel Ballou, how are you doing? Fine.

24:56.362 --> 24:59.527
Oh, yes, education has improved. Wonderful. 
Wonderful.

25:11.963 --> 25:15.987
Y'all ever had any racial problems you heard? Oh, 
yes. When they first started to integrate here,

25:19.330 --> 25:32.443
some of the whites, and after it done been law and 
everything, they wasn't going to let them go. And

25:32.463 --> 25:36.907
of course, I always belonged to the PTA. And when 
this day school started, used to mothers would go.

25:42.406 --> 25:45.730
Well, John was in the sixth grade. And that morning 
when we got to school, they'd hired a colored

25:47.331 --> 25:51.656
teacher. Oh, here comes some of them because I was 
the oldest mother or grandmother. We're not going

25:58.884 --> 26:00.245
to have her. Our children, we're going to do this 
and we're going to do that. I said, let me tell you

26:04.590 --> 26:06.692
something right now. You're up against a brick 
wall. I said, we sat in the saddle. We didn't think

26:11.376 --> 26:12.698
it would come. I didn't. They didn't. And I said, 
it's come, and you better go home and keep your

26:14.881 --> 26:18.827
mouth shut. Well, I'm going to teach my child that 
first thing she says, pick up a rock and hit her. I

26:24.334 --> 26:25.977
said, you are headed for trouble. When I got home, I 
said, John, you sit down. We're going to have a

26:29.762 --> 26:33.327
little roundtable discussion. He sat down. I 
said... Ms. Robinson was her name, and she's crazy

26:35.950 --> 26:39.775
about John now. I said, you say yes ma'am and no 
ma'am to her, and if ever any trouble, you come and

26:40.717 --> 26:50.390
tell me, I'll settle it. Wasn't no time till John 
was crazy about her, and she's crazy about John.

26:55.377 --> 26:58.942
But oh, she had it rough for a while.

27:01.846 --> 27:05.130
They fought, the black and the white fought, 
They'd done everything you could think of doing,

27:05.988 --> 27:10.053
but John never was in it. He had better not ever been 
in it either. We had it. We didn't have to have it.

27:16.341 --> 27:18.724
But people said, oh, that won't ever come. The 
black and white won't ever mix. Well, after it was

27:21.747 --> 27:23.830
passed, what are you going to do? There was nothing 
you could do. And she was a good teacher. Is she

27:31.219 --> 27:32.680
still teaching? No, she retired. She has a nice 
brick home over here. Oh my goodness, I can see her.

27:40.216 --> 27:41.361
She'll see Karen. She wants to know how John is.
