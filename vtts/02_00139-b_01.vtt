WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:10.795
I would take the material from the horse that was 
recently born and then, you know, work on

00:02.123 --> 00:10.795
developing cell lines. And I developed a few cell 
lines from that, primary cell cultures. Then I

00:15.061 --> 00:20.989
worked on developing some leukocytes, some cell 
cultures from leukocytes. And that's what my

00:21.069 --> 00:27.198
thesis had to do with, part of my thesis had to do 
with developing a leukocyte cell culture system.

00:27.358 --> 00:27.558
All right. Now, how many years of coursework did 
you take? Oh, let's see. I took two years. Two

00:33.058 --> 00:33.498
years. Yeah. And was there a time, was there an 
official process where you submitted a thesis

00:35.200 --> 00:44.752
proposal and it was approved by? Yeah, but I pretty 
well did that my first year. So no hang-ups there?

00:50.098 --> 00:58.388
Really, I didn't have any hang-ups whatsoever 
with my studies, contrary to what happens a lot of

00:50.098 --> 00:58.388
time these days. I pretty well knew what I wanted to 
do. I was pretty well guided into... I was given a

01:03.439 --> 01:08.348
lot of freedom to do whatever I wanted to do, but it 
was pretty well structured. Now, who were the

01:08.568 --> 01:13.978
people that were most positive in their 
encouragement of what you were working on? Gee,

01:14.379 --> 01:19.228
just about everybody I came in contact with out 
there at Haskell. I mean, as I say, that's the

01:19.782 --> 01:24.650
fortunate thing about this. Well, Wayne Moore, of 
course, was primary. Now, you may want to delete

01:29.018 --> 01:36.190
this, but Wayne had a lot of emotional problems 
later on. In fact, I think he's in an institution

01:36.651 --> 01:39.476
now. Well, I tried to. He's a real bright, he was a 
real bright person, but he was, he had a few hangups

01:41.095 --> 01:49.585
about- Who did you say was- Oh, I'm sorry. Wayne, 
Leland Grumbles was my chairman. All right, yeah.

01:55.331 --> 02:02.159
Now, did you go by at any regular pace to keep him 
posted on what the progress you were making? As a

02:04.041 --> 02:05.483
matter of fact, I didn't have to. quite often I 
would go by and say, you know, I wonder what this,

02:06.104 --> 02:11.429
how this would work. Or I would say, you know, he 
didn't, you know, he ran a, he ran the department,

02:11.449 --> 02:22.921
he had an open-door policy, at least for me. I never 
had any problem in visiting with him at all. And so I

02:25.684 --> 02:28.327
would go by and say, I wonder how this would work. Or 
I'd say, you know, I got this idea. And, you know, it

02:30.809 --> 02:33.512
was a, I guess you'd say a Socrates-like situation 
where... What were some of the... Well, I didn't

02:35.737 --> 02:50.195
have any problems meeting, I mean, I just didn't 
feel that there were any deadlines. Were there any

02:50.635 --> 02:54.600
steps that you remember, oh, I was glad when I did 
this and this? Yeah. Well, actually, as I look back

02:56.823 --> 03:00.968
over, I mean, at the time, you mean I was glad that I 
did this and I wish that I'd done something other

03:02.517 --> 03:30.010
than this yeah oh there have been times the from the 
broad picture there have been times when I when I

03:02.517 --> 03:30.010
regretted not having gone on to medical school no I 
mean on your in your research oh in my oh okay yeah oh

03:02.517 --> 03:30.010
yeah yeah lord there was I mean uh see I was 
collecting tissues for example I was collecting

03:02.517 --> 03:30.010
tissues from from a pretty dirty source, trying to 
make cell cultures out of them. And I'd get a

03:36.214 --> 03:41.681
beautiful culture of fungus and bacteria and not a 
culture of cell culture, you know. And a lot of

03:43.123 --> 03:55.778
times, I mean, I had the, I thought that these 
leukocyte cells, I thought that, man, I thought

03:43.123 --> 03:55.778
that's the, this organism or this, you know, this 
virus, I felt fairly certain was one that infected

03:57.074 --> 04:03.506
leukozytes, and later on it's found to be that. And 
so I had hoped that I'd be able to develop this

04:04.388 --> 04:19.757
leukozyte cell culture line and then take it over 
there to the electron microscope and look at it and

04:04.388 --> 04:19.757
see it, and time after time after time I'd take it 
over there and I wouldn't see a damn thing. And so

04:21.037 --> 04:31.668
many times I'd get these cells going and they 
wouldn't grow and, you know, that

04:21.037 --> 04:31.668
sort of thing. There's several of those kind of 
instances. I tried to incubate, put the things in a

04:34.190 --> 04:46.943
common method for isolating viruses is to use 
inbreeding eggs, chicken eggs. And you'll

04:47.024 --> 04:49.347
inoculate the chicken eggs in there. Well, I don't 
know, I didn't know at the time. First of all, I

04:54.134 --> 04:57.038
didn't know for sure I was dealing with the virus 
because I couldn't see it. I didn't have a good

04:58.060 --> 05:02.165
system for culturing it, and so I was really sort of 
playing blind. And I was beginning to wonder

05:02.206 --> 05:09.155
really if I had made an error in selecting this as a 
problem because it looked like I wasn't gonna get

05:02.206 --> 05:09.155
to an endpoint. Cuz if I couldn't show the virus, I 
couldn't, I was really frustrated over that. But

05:16.792 --> 05:27.650
there was an element in it that- When did you know 
that you were going to be able to reach a successful

05:16.792 --> 05:27.650
conclusion with that project? When I started 
seeing the virus under the electron microscope.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.405
Okay, and that took about how many months or years? 
No, it took about eight months, eight or nine

05:37.447 --> 05:40.993
months. And then- Well, there was another element 
to the project. See, this disease, it cycles. So I

05:53.430 --> 06:09.090
had kind of the wild idea that this cycling, this 
fever and so forth, was associated with

05:53.430 --> 06:09.090
something, some destruction of cells or 
production of something that is unusual to the

06:09.847 --> 06:37.997
host and so I started looking for a protean or a 
component and that's when I was I was trying to

06:09.847 --> 06:37.997
visit with with Mac Prescott about this and I and so 
I had the theory that an abnormal protean was

06:09.847 --> 06:37.997
involved in this and so I started trying to isolate 
it and I used column chromatography and

06:09.847 --> 06:37.997
electrophoresis and sure enough did isolate a 
component that was it now is recognized there's a

06:38.534 --> 07:06.060
immune globulin is referred to as gamma globulin 
you know it's it now you can recognize it as an

06:38.534 --> 07:06.060
abnormal immune globulin

06:38.534 --> 07:06.060
while there may have been literature on that at the 
time I'm not aware I wasn't aware of it and I'm still

06:38.534 --> 07:06.060
not aware of it being available being around at 
that time at any rate when I saw the virus and when I

07:07.238 --> 07:33.027
this this hypothesis kind of kind of fell into 
place that I'm dealing with that the disease is

07:07.238 --> 07:33.027
associated with with the virus number one and that 
it's associated with an abnormal protean number

07:07.238 --> 07:33.027
two that's when boy that was ecstasy because I was 
really you know I really felt like I was in and as a

07:07.238 --> 07:33.027
matter of fact Wayne was working was working with a 
procedure for screening for EIA based upon a

07:34.559 --> 08:03.756
serologic technique that that we found out later 
was based upon that abnormal protein and

07:34.559 --> 08:03.756
subsequently we didn't publish that see we were 
just playing in the lab and subsequently someone

08:04.934 --> 08:06.757
His name was Charles Coggins. He may have been from 
Missouri. I'm not sure where he was from, but

08:08.179 --> 08:14.830
anyway, he developed what's called the Coggins 
test, and that's the standard test. Even today,

08:14.910 --> 08:18.677
that's the standard test for screening for this 
disease. All right. Do you remember going into

08:21.802 --> 08:26.850
somebody and saying, I found it, I found it? Oh, 
yeah. Yeah, and of course Wayne was, yeah, we were,

08:28.407 --> 08:47.530
I said, we,

08:28.407 --> 08:47.530
Wayne was not a person to use hells and dams and that 
sort of thing, but when I showed him those ems of the

08:28.407 --> 08:47.530
agent, and he said,

08:51.543 --> 08:53.225
I said, we're there. We've got it, man. All right, 
now, so you finished your dissertation. Finished

08:57.871 --> 08:58.852
the dissertation. What year? How many years? 
Well, let's see, I went there in 64, 60, the summer,

09:01.215 --> 09:08.525
the fall of 66. So the third year? Third year, yeah. 
Third year. And I came on the staff in 67. Now...

09:23.909 --> 09:26.152
Of course, you know. What was your first academic 
title? I was a research associate first. First,

09:32.081 --> 09:33.142
and then? And then I became assistant professor 
the following fall. I was a research associate in

09:35.826 --> 09:40.833
June of 67, and then in the fall. All right, now this 
will be the last dollar question. Do you remember

09:44.298 --> 09:47.583
what your salary was when you became assistant 
professor? Yeah. Let's see. It seemed like it was

09:50.948 --> 09:53.832
$15,000. And by then, had you decided yes or no 
about medical school? Well, I was really

10:00.102 --> 10:01.725
comfortable. I really felt comfortable, but I 
was, you know, I still had a, I got to know several of

10:02.427 --> 10:14.571
the physicians around town, and I, you know, I got 
to thinking, gosh, I'd like to be doing what those

10:02.427 --> 10:14.571
guys are doing, but But then, and also I had some 
people from Plum Island, the lab in Plum Island,

10:15.412 --> 10:39.163
which has to do with animal diseases, had 
contacted me, invited me up to, and this is just out

10:15.412 --> 10:39.163
of the blue, invited me up to talk about my EIA work 
and that sort of thing. But, yeah, I was still

10:39.704 --> 10:44.490
thinking about medical school, but I still... I 
was aware of the fact that I had two children and

10:45.247 --> 10:56.299
another one on the way, and we still weren't, I 
didn't explore the possibilities. There

10:56.319 --> 11:06.531
probably were a number of

10:56.319 --> 11:06.531
financial assistantships, but that went further 
and further back in my mind. When you joined the

11:06.851 --> 11:15.000
department as an assistant professor, were you 
the only one without a DVM? Well,

11:15.385 --> 11:24.508
shortly afterwards, Jim Grimes followed me, and 
he was the other one. Okay. But we sort of set, you

11:24.829 --> 11:28.658
know, there weren't any at that time. Did anybody 
ever... Yep, yep, yep, yep. Quite often,

11:32.969 --> 11:34.512
sometimes. Not a lot of times. Was it always 
teasing or sometimes serious? No, sometimes

11:38.999 --> 11:40.201
pretty serious. You know, you can't really be 
doing that sort of thing because you're not a

11:40.241 --> 11:45.450
practitioner. Or you can't be making those kind of 
statements because you're not a practitioner.

11:50.317 --> 11:57.427
You can't culture those birds like that because 
only, I think you just said, you don't know what

11:50.317 --> 11:57.427
you're talking about. All right, but there, yeah, 
there was a lot of, not a lot, but there was some of

11:57.947 --> 12:03.695
that sort of thing. Yeah, this is 67. About how many 
faculty were in veterinary microbiology then?

12:12.046 --> 12:12.667
Let's see. Archie Flowers, there was about...

12:19.848 --> 12:20.751
Seven. Seven. And Leland Grumbles was the 
chairman. And were there any, was the College of

12:25.204 --> 12:34.009
Veterinary Medicine going through any kinds of 
trauma or? Yeah, as a matter of fact, in, let's see,

12:35.069 --> 12:56.008
in 69, the first time that the vet school came up for 
accreditation while I was there, and I believe

12:35.069 --> 12:56.008
that was in 69, it looked like that Al Price was 
going to have to step down. Because they were, the

12:58.510 --> 13:05.076
vet school was kind of under the gun. Let's

13:05.140 --> 13:25.703
see,

13:05.140 --> 13:25.703
Texas Tech was also wanting to be a vet school, and 
Governor-

13:05.140 --> 13:25.703
Preston Smith, from Lubbock. From Lubbock, was 
really pressing to make it. So these things kind of

13:29.547 --> 13:34.152
really put a lot of pressure on the 
administration. I mean, you know, I was just sort

13:36.633 --> 13:51.229
of a bystander, but, you know, the possibility of 
another vet school, the problems I'm not sure

13:51.884 --> 14:04.819
where there's a, I don't know the details on the 
accreditation issue because I wasn't in the

13:51.884 --> 14:04.819
thing, but there was some concern about 
accreditation at that time. And there was some

14:04.879 --> 14:13.068
concern about Al as a, whether he'd been there long 
enough or that maybe it was time for him to move on. I

14:13.629 --> 14:20.457
don't know what, and I'm not, that was all hearsay 
at that time, so of the situation, but there was a

14:21.128 --> 14:23.491
lot of turmoil. By then, were there some women in 
that school? In 69, I believe it was 69, the first

14:28.016 --> 14:31.640
woman came in. Do you remember? Yes. Do I remember 
anything? Yes, yes. What was it like when the first

14:35.605 --> 14:38.188
women came? Well, actually, well,

14:38.308 --> 14:49.060
the young lady's name was Sonya.

14:50.407 --> 14:51.990
Gosh, I can't remember her last name. When you 
think of it, let me know. I will, yeah. Because I'd

14:55.558 --> 14:56.901
love to interview her. She would be excellent to, 
yeah. What was it really like? Yeah, that would be a

15:00.910 --> 15:03.956
good one to, she would be a good one to interview. 
What did the faculty in general think about

15:04.257 --> 15:08.466
female? Whoa, whoa. Some of those people that you 
have listed on that list right there were really

15:09.982 --> 15:15.090
opposed. In your estimation, if there had been a 
secret ballot, what would the vet faculty have

15:15.391 --> 15:23.343
voted? They would not have. They would have voted 
no? Yeah. What about black students? We didn't

15:31.556 --> 15:33.239
have any black students at all. What would they, if 
they had voted no? what would they have felt about

15:36.037 --> 15:38.720
admitting blacks to vet school? Oh, definitely 
not. There's a kind of a sick story about that

15:40.682 --> 15:47.028
issue. Let's see, this was 67. You know, we had 
departmental faculty meetings on a weekly basis.

15:59.080 --> 16:05.166
And one of the faculty members who held a joint 
appointment in another, in the animal science

15:59.080 --> 16:05.166
department, made a, to me, a very distasteful

16:06.833 --> 16:17.465
comment. And I'm saying this because this kind of 
gives you the flavor of the times, and it probably

16:19.166 --> 16:28.477
was throughout much of the saddle.

16:29.858 --> 16:34.343
When Martin Luther King was doing his thing about, 
you know, He said, I heard one of those guys said

16:35.842 --> 16:45.772
that that negro is gonna get all us niggers killed. 
And boy, a

16:48.154 --> 16:54.060
lot of people laughed over that. And there were 
some of us that were really disgusted with that

16:56.002 --> 16:59.385
situation. And I don't really know why we had You 
know, in Roton, Texas, the people, now that's not

17:03.837 --> 17:18.572
true now, I'm sure, but people in Roton, Texas were 
very biased. And I don't know why I'm not. or why I

17:23.058 --> 17:24.940
was not, but I wasn't. This just really bothered 
me. So that kind of gives you the black students,

17:28.703 --> 17:37.392
black applicants would not have made it at that 
time, in my opinion. How long was it before you had a

17:39.074 --> 17:43.238
female in one of your sections? Well, you see, I

17:44.799 --> 17:50.905
was, I was not teaching. I was not actually 
involved in teaching for the first few years that I

17:53.250 --> 17:58.844
was there. Describe your duties. I was, well, one 
of the first things I did was to write a grant for, I

18:01.111 --> 18:12.483
was involved in grant writing, and that's, that 
was kind of the thing I did. Was it, did someone make

18:13.164 --> 18:20.351
it clear to you that part of your future would 
depend on your ability to get grants? No, I never

18:20.832 --> 18:22.834
felt that. It probably did, but I never felt that 
way, and in fact, I never, Strangely enough,

18:31.132 --> 18:38.745
Haskell, that environment has always been 
nurturing to me.

18:39.637 --> 18:49.633
It's positive and I really, with a few exceptions 
of, you're not a DVM, you're not a veterinarian,

18:39.637 --> 18:49.633
you can't do that sort of thing. But most of the time 
there wasn't that sort of thing. But let's see,

18:56.204 --> 18:59.129
I've lost my train of thought now. We were talking 
about, My research, yeah. I mean, where I was

19:04.897 --> 19:06.859
supposed to get. No, that wasn't something that I 
had to do. It's just something I kind of enjoyed

19:12.345 --> 19:14.547
doing. And so my first effort didn't have anything 
to do with EIA. It had to do with microbiology. And I

19:23.476 --> 19:30.383
wrote a grant that Wayne was into swine in a big way. 
And I put together, actually Ghost wrote it,

19:31.865 --> 19:39.756
because he was better known than I. He was the 
principal investigator, but I wrote the grant for

19:40.697 --> 19:43.621
him. We explored the possibility of the impact of 
various dietary components on the intestinal

19:44.643 --> 19:56.860
microflora of swine.

19:57.886 --> 20:20.704
role of those microbes in in bile acid metabolism 
bile and and the significance of that has to do with

19:57.886 --> 20:20.704
atherosclerosis in cardiovascular diseases so 
we wrote a we wrote one of the bigger grants at that

19:57.886 --> 20:20.704
time to explore the role of of diet high high high 
lipid high uh high glucose and that sort of thing

20:22.220 --> 20:52.227
the impact on the intestinal microflora with the 
implication that that those changes in the

20:22.220 --> 20:52.227
microflora now this was for how much do you 
remember the grant I believe it was two hundred and

20:22.220 --> 20:52.227
fifty thousand dollars from NIH NIH yeah well we 
had some we had some ultimately we had some pretty

20:22.220 --> 20:52.227
pretty powerful horses on it we well again you know 
I was I've been real lucky. One of the individuals

20:53.929 --> 21:01.479
at Baylor Medical School at the Department of 
Microbiology had been with me in the Army. And so I

21:03.021 --> 21:07.467
called him and told him this is what we were doing. 
He said, that's a great idea. I said, yeah, we'd

21:08.849 --> 21:11.132
like to cooperate with you. And then I told Wayne. 
And so he contacted him, and then the Department of

21:11.913 --> 21:18.181
Pathology there got interested in it. And so we had 
a pretty strong relationship. you know,

21:22.328 --> 21:28.455
collaborative effort between Baylor Med School 
and us on that project. And that project lasted how

21:28.575 --> 21:30.437
long? Three years. Three years? Yeah. One of the 
things that kind of gave rise to, see, I was doing

21:34.122 --> 21:50.040
that, let's see, I started doing that, I guess we 
were working on that in 68, the year after I got

21:34.122 --> 21:50.040
there, and we we had to house the the pigs in a 
particular you know we had to kind of keep them

21:50.729 --> 22:19.183
clean so me and this other guy not Gordon but 
another guy in the in the department uh we're going

21:50.729 --> 22:19.183
to be working on that project and we failed to 
incorporate enough money I mean there's plenty of

21:50.729 --> 22:19.183
money there salaries and that sort of thing 
supplies but we failed to incorporate enough

21:50.729 --> 22:19.183
money in there to to for the holding pins for the 
pigs so we had to build the damn things and we made

22:20.108 --> 22:46.082
them out of concrete and we we designed them and 
they they were they were you know they were uh you

22:20.108 --> 22:46.082
know a pig pen again i'm not i'm not i don't know very 
didn't know but then and still don't know very much

22:20.108 --> 22:46.082
about pigs about right rearing pigs but we built a 
some concrete uh made them out of concrete, and

22:47.480 --> 22:56.734
made it so that the droppings went into the pen 
itself. It had its self-watering in this pen,

22:57.475 --> 23:06.408
essentially their own, to make a long story short, 
their own sewerage system, which we really

22:57.475 --> 23:06.408
thought, and it was a pretty good idea. We built 
those things, and we spent all of one summer and

23:08.912 --> 23:16.103
part of a fall building those things. But we built 
them, and we said that, you know, maybe other

23:16.943 --> 23:24.203
things will get torn down but these pig pens are 
going to be here for the and they are they are still

23:25.094 --> 23:51.490
there where are they located they're located in on 
what is now a veterinary research park and they're

23:25.094 --> 23:51.490
north part they're right next to the where the USDA 
building is fairly close to where the USDA you said

23:25.094 --> 23:51.490
you all built them you mean you all actually we 
actually got out the physical labor yes sir yes sir

23:25.094 --> 23:51.490
we because we didn't have the we we hadn't hadn't 
didn't have the funds to do it and At that time, they

23:52.786 --> 24:07.646
were doing a lot of, as I say, Polorum testing, and 
there was one lady from Caldwell that really

23:52.786 --> 24:07.646
didn't, you know, she would drive in from Caldwell 
and then go back and didn't really have much

23:52.786 --> 24:07.646
contact with the university community. So she 
came up to me one day and said, Don,

24:07.666 --> 24:15.597
I just got my PhD. I said, Don, what does PhD stand 
for? And just out of the blue, I said, well, I won't,

24:21.068 --> 24:25.618
well, I will. Ms. Fick was her name, but that's 
neither here nor there. I said, well, Ms. Fick,

24:29.547 --> 24:35.481
actually, Ph.D., you know what Mr. Thomas and I are 
doing. We're building these pig pens, and so Ph.D.

24:35.501 --> 24:40.512
actually stands for pig house designer. and I 
guess from that day forward she knew that she felt

24:41.892 --> 25:09.402
like the PhD meant pig house designer but that's 
you know so we built those pens and did that work and

24:41.892 --> 25:09.402
we spent three years and and I guess about 200 you 
know whatever it was

24:41.892 --> 25:09.402
we didn't see a correlation between Microflora 
and diet and that sort of thing. And about that

25:14.697 --> 25:25.048
time,

25:14.697 --> 25:25.048
kind of where we got the idea, and

25:14.697 --> 25:25.048
we were also involved with NASA, you know. We 
helped to design the lunar receiving lab, you

25:26.049 --> 25:35.018
know, when they were bringing back the moon rocks 
and that sort of thing.

25:35.858 --> 25:39.125
myself and one other person over in plant 
sciences. Well, at that time I had started doing

25:39.425 --> 25:56.820
some work with with aquatic animals and I'd been 
doing some work with the microflora of swine and

25:39.425 --> 25:56.820
they were going to be bringing back they didn't 
know what the microflora, the makeup of the

25:58.572 --> 26:06.523
bacteria might be, whether or not there might. And 
so they wanted some real

26:07.104 --> 26:13.372
high containment facilities. And there weren't 
class three, those things weren't anywhere in the

26:13.412 --> 26:19.020
picture at that time. So we were consultants to 
NASA to help design the holding facilities for

26:20.262 --> 26:27.752
quail, I was getting interested in fish at that 
time too. And that's the connection because one of

26:31.615 --> 26:36.940
the persons in Galveston had mentioned my name. 
And

26:37.020 --> 26:48.172
we designed the part of the holding facilities at 
the lunar receiving and did some of the testing,

26:37.020 --> 26:48.172
which of course was ludicrous. The rocks were 
sterile and kind of figured they'd be sterile.

26:54.118 --> 26:55.560
What was it like to work with NASA? How were they? 
Well, like a real high efficiency machine. I mean,

27:02.316 --> 27:07.343
they really had everything laid out. It was a stark 
contrast to what we had here. We had meetings once a

27:16.575 --> 27:18.978
week. We had updates on whatever.

27:28.297 --> 27:41.036
It operated much like what I would think a 
commercial

27:28.297 --> 27:41.036
industrial drug company, kind of high pressure 
type stuff. And when you work for NASA, they

27:41.116 --> 27:52.093
have to screen you medically. You can't get your 
physicals here, you had to be screened medically

27:53.339 --> 27:58.968
down there. And they were having a meeting, the 
first meeting we were supposed to be going to. We

28:07.502 --> 28:12.931
were supposed to make a presentation and that sort 
of thing, talk about what we were interested in

28:07.502 --> 28:12.931
doing and how we thought things could. And I 
thought I would couple my physical while I was down

28:13.833 --> 28:19.903
there. and so I had been playing tennis the 
afternoon before I went down there and then I got a

28:21.503 --> 28:44.119
call from from them to tell me to have me come down 
there right away to do some sort of a well it was a

28:21.503 --> 28:44.119
glucose test but it was you know some blood testing 
I went down there in my tennis shoes thinking that

28:21.503 --> 28:44.119
I'd and forgot that I hadn't brought any other 
shoes along with me. So here in this sort of formal

28:47.889 --> 29:03.187
structured meeting, I was wearing my tennis shoes 
and sort of an informal type

28:47.889 --> 29:03.187
coat, informal type dress there. And that was kind 
of an embarrassing situation, but I survived it.

29:09.091 --> 29:12.935
All right, did that lead to any other NASA-related 
research? Well, I had an opportunity, yeah, it was

29:13.276 --> 29:18.682
really not of a major portion. I got a small grant to 
about $10,000 to look at, again, to further

29:19.523 --> 29:37.444
explore the microflora of animals that are 
maintained in a in a closed sterile environment.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.995
We didn't have any great breakthroughs on that 
study either. The

29:51.797 --> 30:00.172
one on pigs, you said you all found no relationship 
with the problem. All right, was the fact that that

30:00.573 --> 30:02.436
did not answer the situation was that a plus or a 
minus for you as a researcher in terms of your

30:03.766 --> 30:11.254
future? Oh I

30:11.274 --> 30:31.495
didn't I don't know it's sort of neutral I don't 
know that it impacted impacted me one way or the

30:11.274 --> 30:31.495
other because it was just kind of a wild you know 
it's kind of an idea As far as me personally is

30:33.145 --> 30:40.677
concerned, I think the fact that we studied it to 
begin with gave me some recognition with NIH. But I

30:40.797 --> 30:49.931
didn't pursue that endeavor beyond the small 
studies that I did with- Then keep going forward,

30:40.797 --> 30:49.931
what's next? Okay, well,

30:50.111 --> 31:00.267
and here I get to, I'll introduce John Calhoun.

31:04.955 --> 31:16.592
There was an announcement that came around saying

31:04.955 --> 31:16.592
that Texas A&M was interested in becoming a sea 
grant institution, much the same way that it was a

31:04.955 --> 31:16.592
land grant institution. And Leland brought up 
that issue in one of the.
