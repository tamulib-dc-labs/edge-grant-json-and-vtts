WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:04.818
So really, that's caused no problem. And I think 
you'll see a higher percentage of women coming

00:04.958 --> 00:14.356
into reserve program and the Air Force in general 
in the future than you have in the past. Are there

00:15.017 --> 00:25.718
some parallels between women coming into the 
military and the reserves and women being allowed

00:15.017 --> 00:25.718
here at A&M back in the 1960s? I don't really see 
any. Well, it's parallels as far as attitudes,

00:27.118 --> 00:31.623
initial resistance, which has changed. Oh, OK. I 
would presume so. I would presume so. But here,

00:36.689 --> 00:42.976
once again, after you get used to the idea and you 
see that it's going to work, then you accept it. So

00:44.618 --> 00:48.443
there could be some parallels there, but I never 
thought of it in that context. OK. Let's talk. I'd

00:49.724 --> 00:50.365
like to talk. I went over a number of your 
appointments. and duties here. And I'd like to

00:57.162 --> 01:04.396
talk about the development of the Air Force 
Reserve in the Bryan College Station area. It

01:04.416 --> 01:10.408
looks like there was the 9807 ARS and then the 9412 
ARS. Could you explain that development? I think

01:13.893 --> 01:22.585
at that particular time, that was more or less a 
change in designation of an activity more than an

01:13.893 --> 01:22.585
actual change in the mission or scope of the 
activity. They were shuffling numbers like mad

01:22.605 --> 01:25.229
back in those times. But as I recall, I don't recall 
there being any particular change. I will say that

01:32.579 --> 01:42.432
in all of those time periods, the reserve program 
was nothing more than not much more than a paper

01:43.171 --> 01:45.254
exercise and paperwork. We had no equipment. We 
had very little realistic training. Our training

01:52.907 --> 02:03.785
consisted of taking correspondence courses in 
particular areas and trying to keep up what we call

01:52.907 --> 02:03.785
our general military training. There are certain 
things that we have to go through annually, such as

02:09.867 --> 02:20.283
The Uniform Code of Military Justice, we have to be 
familiar with that, not only so that we can watch

02:09.867 --> 02:20.283
other people, but so that we ourselves will know 
how to conduct ourselves under certain

02:09.867 --> 02:20.283
circumstances.

02:21.484 --> 02:33.042
Things like communication security that we have 
to review every year to refresh on our minds that

02:21.484 --> 02:33.042
there are certain things you don't talk about on 
the telephone. Those types of things, we were able

02:35.145 --> 02:37.528
to get those out of the way. But as far as real gut 
training, to qualify us to go into an active duty

02:39.837 --> 02:42.801
situation. It was almost nonexistent in those 
days. Now, let's clarify. When were those days?

02:49.569 --> 02:54.455
When was the first Air Force Reserve unit in this 
area? I don't know, because it was here before I

02:55.196 --> 02:58.019
came in. I went into the Air Force Reserves in this 
area in about 1960 or 61, as I recall. After I got off

03:04.046 --> 03:07.971
of active duty in 1956, I was living in the Waco 
area. and was assigned to a couple of units up in

03:08.153 --> 03:10.996
that area. They were larger units, but they were 
primarily, once again, where we would meet and do

03:11.016 --> 03:21.486
the best we could with correspondence courses and 
lectures and talks. But we had no field training.

03:25.910 --> 03:27.011
We had no airplanes. We had no equipment. When I 
came from Waco here in probably 1959, 1960, in that

03:29.473 --> 03:36.540
time frame, I immediately aligned with a reserve 
unit here locally, and I've even forgotten the

03:37.128 --> 03:42.235
number, but it would be the first unit that we had. 
9807. 9807, yes, okay. I found the same conditions

03:45.739 --> 03:52.668
to be true here that existed in Waco, and that is no 
equipment. We, of course, all of us wore uniforms,

03:52.808 --> 04:06.966
and we spent a great deal of time on military 
courtesy and chain of command, span of control,

03:52.808 --> 04:06.966
all those kinds of things that are basic to any 
organization, military or otherwise. We had the

04:07.773 --> 04:08.794
nucleus. We had the people that wanted to do it.

04:13.802 --> 04:28.002
And then after that, I really guess when the thing 
turned around for me, and when the reserves turned

04:13.802 --> 04:28.002
around, and you can find the date on it, was my first 
duty assignment at Ellington Air Force Base. And I

04:28.022 --> 04:29.444
believe that was in the 9-25th? That was 9-25th. 
Tag at Ellington. Any of these initials you need me

04:37.793 --> 04:40.898
to clarify for you, I can do that. That's Tactical 
Airlift Group. They had 119s. That was the first

04:44.464 --> 04:45.947
unit I was ever in. 1967 to 1969. They had real 
airplanes, and they would fly. And I'd never been

04:51.857 --> 04:54.521
in a unit that had airplanes before. From that 
point, it got better and better and better until

04:55.403 --> 04:58.508
today. Our airplanes will match active-duty 
airplanes any day of the week. as far as quality of

05:05.148 --> 05:10.075
maintenance and flyability and the people that 
know how to fly them and how to fight. In other

05:11.057 --> 05:16.685
words, from 1967 on down, you've been getting new 
airplanes? No. No. Are you getting the airplanes

05:18.348 --> 05:27.161
that come from the active duty and they decided 
they get the new ones and you get their sort of

05:18.348 --> 05:27.161
hand-me-downs? We have an Air Force base in 
Arizona near Phoenix called Davis-Monthan Air

05:27.461 --> 05:31.668
Force Base. It's otherwise known as the Boneyard 
of the Air Force. When the Air Force can no longer

05:34.713 --> 05:39.580
fly an airplane, they send it to the boneyard. You 
use it for spare parts or for whatever. Well,

05:42.364 --> 05:50.316
instead of sending it to Davis-Monthan, when they 
couldn't get another mile out of it, then they gave

05:42.364 --> 05:50.316
it to the reserves, and then we'd squeeze some more 
miles out of it. That was the beginning. That's the

05:52.079 --> 05:54.963
way the 119s worked. When about did that start? 
That's a significant change. That happened

05:58.629 --> 06:01.513
probably in about 19... 1958, 1959, when we 
started getting those kinds of airplanes. Now

06:06.753 --> 06:08.835
here, once again, I'm relying strictly on my 
memory. That's fine. Now, I could be off 10 years

06:09.556 --> 06:14.022
one way or the other. But this is when I first had 
knowledge of it, to put it that way. But then, we've

06:19.009 --> 06:23.354
always gotten our equipment from the active duty. 
As they would get better equipment, we'd get their

06:23.575 --> 06:26.318
older equipment. But the quality of the equipment 
we get has constantly improved So that now, for

06:32.206 --> 06:42.101
example, in Vietnam and since then, the F-4 has 
been one of our primary fighter aircraft, fighter

06:32.206 --> 06:42.101
bombers, primarily a fighter. All of our units 
have F-4s now. Now, the F-105 was the plane we had

06:46.327 --> 06:52.977
prior to that, which was an excellent airplane, 
still an excellent airplane. But the F-4 is coming

06:52.997 --> 06:56.021
in to take its place. Plus, we've got a unit at Hill 
Air Force Base now.

07:03.222 --> 07:06.405
getting F-16s right off the assembly line, 
getting ready to. So now the reserve groups are

07:07.346 --> 07:11.291
getting brand new equipment. It's never been 
flown before. And is that since the Reagan

07:13.153 --> 07:15.355
administration? Yes. Is that part of the changes, 
do you think, of the Reagan administration? Part

07:21.041 --> 07:23.904
of the increasing defense expenditure? I would 
say that it's a result of the overall realization

07:23.924 --> 07:31.272
that we cannot afford from a fiscal standpoint to 
maintain the kind of active duty air force that we

07:32.602 --> 07:39.089
need to defend the country. But we recognize that 
we have to have certain squares filled in order to

07:40.911 --> 07:45.956
be able to support our various war plans. And so if 
you don't have the money to support those war plans

07:47.097 --> 08:02.153
with active duty forces, then you spend the money 
on the reserves because you can maintain a group or

07:47.097 --> 08:02.153
a wing of reserve aircraft at a fraction of the cost 
that it would cost to maintain an active duty

08:02.437 --> 08:05.581
outfit because of the fact that they work all day 
every day. Sure. Of course, your primary cost,

08:06.021 --> 08:11.648
once you get the equipment cost behind you, you've 
got to have the equipment, whether it's active

08:06.021 --> 08:11.648
duty or reserve. But then once you put that to one 
side, then your payroll cost is your biggest

08:12.229 --> 08:17.436
single cost. And of course, the reservist 
paycheck is a fraction of what an active duty

08:18.497 --> 08:23.903
paycheck would be. But yet, he can meet the same 
standards, the same flying criteria, can fill the

08:24.364 --> 08:31.633
same square in a war plane that an active duty guy 
can fill. So that's why the shift. It's a matter of

08:33.769 --> 08:37.794
we can't afford the kind of active duty force we 
really need. Therefore, this is the alternative

08:37.814 --> 08:40.937
we're accepting. I think it would have come no 
matter who the president had been. We got a bigger

08:46.883 --> 08:52.128
pie, but the pie is not big enough, so the reserves 
are getting a bigger piece of the bigger pie. Oh,

08:52.548 --> 08:53.689
OK. OK. So the Air Force itself has come to this 
realization. Oh, yes. Yes. It's referred to

09:01.803 --> 09:04.367
primarily as a total force policy. And that is a 
major concept. The active duty have always, it's

09:07.512 --> 09:13.682
almost like the acceptance of minorities or 
women. They've always kind of looked down their

09:13.702 --> 09:18.530
nose at reservists as being second-class 
citizens.

09:20.533 --> 09:27.625
Because back in the old days, when we were called 
the ragtag militia, uniforms were tattered the

09:29.039 --> 09:55.131
haircuts were bad shoes were you know well those 
are personal things it was all taken work real hard

09:29.039 --> 09:55.131
at improving the image of the reservist and it's 
paid off i think the active duty force looks at us as

09:29.039 --> 09:55.131
an equal partner in the defense establishment as 
opposed to a second class group of citizens and so

09:29.039 --> 09:55.131
that's why those of us in positions to to manage 
other people when we find, especially at the full

09:55.499 --> 10:13.505
colonel position and above, we look at our people 
much more severely properly than anyone else does

09:55.499 --> 10:13.505
to make sure that when we put a guy in a full 
colonel's position or in a BG position that he's

09:55.499 --> 10:13.505
going to be a credit to the rest of us. Now tell me 
about this total forest policy. When did it become

10:18.172 --> 10:21.377
a volunteer? I would say Once again, I'm going to 
have to pull a figure out of the air. Sure. But I

10:26.747 --> 10:39.338
would say the total force policy has been 
established as an official policy of the Air

10:26.747 --> 10:39.338
Force, Department of the Air Force, for 
approximately 10 years, 8 to 10 years. It's a

10:39.458 --> 10:41.059
relatively new concept.

10:43.582 --> 10:53.670
All the total force policy does is to recognize the 
reserve forces as an integral part of the defense

10:43.582 --> 10:53.670
establishment and as an integral part in 
supporting our war plans. Always before, the war

10:56.377 --> 11:00.021
plans were supported exclusively by the active 
duty forces. Now the reserves are plowed right in

11:00.762 --> 11:07.109
and cranked right in to the requirements to 
support war plans. So that if we execute plan

11:07.129 --> 11:15.599
so-and-so and it calls for so many F4 units, bang, 
they're activated and there they go, just like an

11:07.129 --> 11:15.599
active duty outfit. That's fantastic.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.617
Interesting. Yeah, it sure is interesting. I want 
to talk about the change and the status of the local

11:25.621 --> 11:35.671
Air Force Reserve units. We started this 
conversation a little bit ago about the history of

11:35.752 --> 11:39.976
it. How has it changed? And what's the chain of 
command? If a young man wants to get into the Air

11:43.580 --> 11:48.966
Force Reserve here, what's the chain of command 
today? And what's the status? Actually, at the

11:51.498 --> 11:57.444
time I went to Ellington Air Force Base was when the 
local Air Force Reserve unit was phased out. We

11:57.724 --> 12:02.128
have no local Air Force Reserve units here in the 
College Station Bryan area. And since then, the

12:02.148 --> 12:07.713
Ellington Air Force Base unit has been 
transferred to Bergstrom Air Force Base at

12:02.148 --> 12:07.713
Austin, Texas. There is no Air Force Reserve unit 
in Houston, the largest metropolitan area in the

12:08.294 --> 12:14.920
United States, without an Air Force Reserve unit. 
Now, let me back up and say one thing that needs to be

12:15.901 --> 12:19.564
said. When I'm talking about Air Force Reserve, 
well, there are two terms that let me clarify.

12:27.736 --> 12:29.578
There's what we call Air Reserve Forces. When you 
hear the term Air Reserve Forces, you're talking

12:30.719 --> 12:36.846
about Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard. 
That's the Air Reserve Forces is all of the Reserve

12:37.767 --> 12:41.952
Forces. Now, I've not talked about Guard because I 
know very little about the Air Force National

12:41.972 --> 12:48.319
Guard, the Air National Guard. As you know, during 
peacetime, they're under the jurisdiction of the

12:48.907 --> 12:52.831
governor of the various states. During wartime, 
they're nationalized, then they become a

12:52.851 --> 12:56.295
national resource. The guard units are plowed 
into the warplanes just the way Air Force Reserve

12:57.136 --> 13:03.042
units are. They do have an Air National Guard unit 
in Houston, but not an Air Force Reserve unit. So if

13:09.029 --> 13:14.574
a young man wanted to get in the Air Force Reserve 
here, chances are his best bet would be at Austin.

13:15.375 --> 13:16.416
Now, we... The... United States is divided up into 
what we call three numbered air forces. They're

13:22.949 --> 13:24.331
not geographical areas. They're divided up by 
weapon systems. There's a fourth air force, which

13:27.415 --> 13:36.769
is a numbered air force commanded by a two-star 
reserve general located at Sacramento,

13:27.415 --> 13:36.769
California, at McClellan Air Force Base. There's 
10th Air Force, which is commanded also, all these

13:36.789 --> 13:40.675
are commanded by two-star generals. As I 
mentioned, it was the highest rank that an air

13:41.275 --> 13:47.905
force reservist can hold under present law at 
Bergstrom Air Force Base. And then there's 14th

13:48.374 --> 14:01.833
Air Force, which is,

13:48.374 --> 14:01.833
what is, my mind's gone blank on where the 14th Air 
Force is located. Oh, we can fill it in later. Okay,

14:04.036 --> 14:04.977
it'll come to me. But in any event, those air forces 
primarily are divided up by weapons systems. Now

14:12.387 --> 14:16.373
the 4th and the 14th on the west coast and the east 
coast primarily have tactical airlift aircraft.

14:18.430 --> 14:19.792
In other words, they have the C-130s. Basically, 
the C-130 is their airplane right now for hauling

14:21.574 --> 14:24.898
things. The 14th has things east of the 
Mississippi. The 4th has things west of the

14:28.041 --> 14:31.906
Mississippi, all the units in those areas. 
Whereas 10th Air Force, the headquarters at

14:31.926 --> 14:41.437
Bergstrom Air Force Base, the one I was assigned to 
for so many years, well, previously it was at

14:31.926 --> 14:41.437
Ellington called Central Air Force Reserve 
Region. It was transferred to Bergstrom and

14:41.878 --> 14:46.123
re-designated 10th Air Force. has all the 
fighters and aircraft that are primarily gained

14:46.407 --> 14:55.000
by tactical air command. Also, we have all the 
aircraft that are gained by strategic air

14:55.882 --> 15:01.450
command, which includes your KC-135 tankers. 
We're getting into the KC-10 tanker now at

15:01.871 --> 15:05.416
Barksdale Air Force Base. All those assets are 
gained by strategic air command. 10th Air Force

15:11.606 --> 15:13.849
had responsibility for those units. Do you have 
any B-1 bombers? No, no B-1s online yet. Do you have

15:19.796 --> 15:20.757
any B-52s? No, not in the reserve program. KC-135 
is the tanker, which is a refueler for the B-52s.

15:30.186 --> 15:31.988
It's the heaviest thing we've gotten into yet. Do 
you think eventually you'll all get some bombers?

15:37.574 --> 15:38.335
It's hard to say. Strategic Air Command... has 
such a quick response time in the matter of minutes

15:41.099 --> 15:47.788
that I'm not sure reservists will ever man the 
bombers at B-52. That's absolutely true. Because

15:49.550 --> 15:53.476
we have to respond in 24 hours. SAC can't live with 
that kind of response. No, absolutely. It's 25

15:56.580 --> 15:58.723
minutes from Moscow to . That's right. That's 
true. But I really don't think you'll ever see any

16:01.486 --> 16:08.676
reserve

16:01.486 --> 16:08.676
bomber crews. There was a lot of hesitancy on 
whether we could ever handle a reserve tanker

16:09.685 --> 16:27.627
operation, but that seemed to be working 
relatively well because you've got more lead time

16:09.685 --> 16:27.627
on tankers than you have on bombers and what have 
you. But if someone in this area wanted to get in the

16:27.647 --> 16:32.273
reserve program, he would go to Berkshire Air 
Force Base. Now, 10th Air Force is the

16:32.453 --> 16:35.277
headquarters command. It's a giant paper mill. It 
has no airplanes itself. It manages a lot of units

16:38.558 --> 16:42.023
all over the United States that have airplanes. 
One of the units, the 924th, used to be the 924th

16:42.464 --> 16:47.632
Tactical Airlift Group. I don't know what the new 
designation was. They've renumbered it since I

16:49.215 --> 16:51.739
was there. It is located at Bergstrom Air Force 
Base. So that would be the place for a young man to

16:55.244 --> 16:58.049
go. Now, every base has what they call a reserve, an 
air reserve management officer, an ARMO.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.283
Basically, he's usually a master sergeant. our 
senior master sergeant, and he kind of keeps an eye

17:07.600 --> 17:14.188
on all the reserve slots on that base. So it's a 
single point of contact that a young man can go say,

17:14.208 --> 17:18.714
hey, I live over at Collin Station. I'm interested 
in getting a reserve program. Is there anything

17:20.497 --> 17:21.618
here for me? He knows where all the vacancies are, 
what all the skill requirements are, and he can

17:22.339 --> 17:30.549
help place individuals that have an interest in 
it. I'm wondering about the relationship that you

17:30.569 --> 17:35.576
have with the Air National Guard. Very little. 
That's right. At our level. Now, at the air staff

17:39.152 --> 17:53.332
level, the two-star general in charge of the 
National Guard, General Conaway, General John

17:39.152 --> 17:53.332
Conaway, and our boss, General Sandy Gill, Air 
Force Reserve General, probably live together.

17:53.893 --> 17:54.995
They're together all the time. But below that 
level, we don't really have much to do with each

17:55.575 --> 17:58.920
other. Our paths just don't cross that much. Is 
there friction between the two groups? No, not

18:04.027 --> 18:04.728
really. Not really. Well, I've heard that, or I 
have heard from some reservists, that while they

18:06.275 --> 18:19.513
are National Guard, they're just a bunch of 
political appointee types, and they're not

18:06.275 --> 18:19.513
really the military, and they're just good old 
boys. Would you respond to them? I will say that the

18:21.896 --> 18:32.130
National Guard has a tremendous political impact 
on this nation, more so than the Reserves.

18:34.253 --> 18:38.999
primarily because of the fact that they can exert 
pressure through the various governors of the

18:34.253 --> 18:38.999
state. I think it's a matter that

18:40.381 --> 18:56.562
they've just been at it longer than we have, and 
they've honed to perfection

18:40.381 --> 18:56.562
their abilities to muster political force when 
it's needed.

18:59.967 --> 19:03.872
Obviously, the military is prohibited from 
participating in any political activity. But

19:04.240 --> 19:15.671
when we're wearing our civilian clothes, like 
today, we're civilians, and we can call our

19:04.240 --> 19:15.671
congressman, ride the president, do whatever we 
want to as civilians. And we can express an

19:16.232 --> 19:22.738
interest in things pertaining to the military, 
whereas an active duty guy cannot do that. So I

19:23.779 --> 19:32.408
think the active duty force recognizes the 
reserve as the only shot they have at playing

19:23.779 --> 19:32.408
politics. They don't use that in a direct way. But 
through our knowing and our proximity to the

19:39.026 --> 19:58.010
military and knowing what some of our crying needs 
are, there's nothing that prevents us as

19:39.026 --> 19:58.010
individuals of picking up a phone and calling our 
congressman or when Phil Graham comes to town to

19:39.026 --> 19:58.010
see him and say, boy, we sure need some support and 
some aircraft spares because we're hurting bad.

19:58.331 --> 20:02.496
Well, that brings up an interesting point, the 
active duty people. perhaps using or mobilizing

20:02.999 --> 20:09.029
the reservists to put pressure on Washington. Is 
there, without naming names, of course, has there

20:09.129 --> 20:27.460
been in your career any attempt for active duty 
officers to say, OK, you reservists, maybe at your

20:09.129 --> 20:27.460
two-week camp or something like that, OK, you 
reservists, go home and write your congressman

20:09.129 --> 20:27.460
about this or that? Has there ever been any 
examples like that? I've never heard of it

20:29.847 --> 20:31.089
happening. And in fact, the active duty goes out of 
its way to make sure that that never happens

20:31.389 --> 20:39.739
because it's not proper.

20:42.683 --> 20:49.591
Now, that's not to say that a lot of reservists 
don't do exactly the things that the active duty

20:42.683 --> 20:49.591
would like to see us do. But it's not done at the 
request or at the direction of the active duty.

20:52.475 --> 20:58.082
It's a self-initiated thing that reservists see a 
need because of their proximity to the situation.

20:58.450 --> 21:02.395
and try to do something about it in their civilian 
capacity. Yeah, I wouldn't think that would be.

21:04.397 --> 21:12.486
Now, let's talk a little bit about the 
relationship between the Air Force Reserve in the

21:04.397 --> 21:12.486
state and the Army Reserve in the state. Is there 
much of a relationship there? No. As long as I've

21:18.173 --> 21:23.479
been in the Reserve Program, I know absolutely 
nothing about the Army Reserve Program. I know a

21:23.965 --> 21:26.788
bunch of individuals that are in the local Army 
Reserve. Lynn Stewart, for example, is a good

21:26.868 --> 21:28.629
friend of mine. Sure. Kent Potts and Ronnie Hale 
and a few people like that that are close personal

21:29.910 --> 21:35.796
friends of mine. But we've never talked about the 
Reserve program together other than the fact that

21:35.856 --> 21:43.603
we recognize and respect the fact that we're 
making a contribution in our own way. But I've

21:44.604 --> 21:50.429
never had an interface at all with any Army Reserve 
outfits at all. No Army Reservations? no Army

21:52.450 --> 21:59.879
Reserve units than I've ever gone out with Air 
Force Reserve units on any type of maneuvers. Not

22:00.039 --> 22:00.760
to my knowledge. The only interface we've ever had 
is that we do furnish airlift support for some

22:01.421 --> 22:13.154
paratroop drops periodically, but we're 
basically flying the platform that they jump off

22:01.421 --> 22:13.154
of is what it amounts to. But I've never been 
involved personally with any of that. I know that

22:15.377 --> 22:20.483
it happens all the time, but as far as any joint 
maneuvers or anything like that. I've never been

22:22.757 --> 22:23.838
involved with it.

22:27.281 --> 22:30.564
Let's talk a little bit about the Volunteer Army. 
That must have had an impact on the reserves. It

22:34.849 --> 22:35.229
did.

22:38.312 --> 22:51.145
I would say that,

22:38.312 --> 22:51.145
well, once the draft was eliminated, our number of 
applicants dropped pretty drastically because

22:51.631 --> 23:01.363
as we mentioned yesterday, that a number of people 
are inclined to prefer to serve their country in

22:51.631 --> 23:01.363
the reserve rather than to run the risk of being 
drafted. Even though the risk is relatively

23:01.383 --> 23:03.686
small, the risk was there. And some of them didn't 
choose to take the risk. The minute the draft was

23:06.489 --> 23:14.919
dropped and it became all volunteer, then there 
was not the threat of the draft. So therefore, they

23:14.959 --> 23:17.422
didn't need to seek an alternative. So it had a 
definite impact on our recruiting. I would say

23:20.808 --> 23:25.196
that the impact was relatively short lived.

23:26.358 --> 23:40.402
I sense, and I think I've talked to a number of other 
people that sense, that there's a kind of a rebirth

23:26.358 --> 23:40.402
of nationalism in this country, that there seems 
to be almost a wave of patriotism sweeping the

23:26.358 --> 23:40.402
country that's been absent for a long time. I think 
it's kind of a digging out the quagmire of Vietnam.

23:47.082 --> 24:02.683
At the time, the Vietnamese situation was going 
and up to and immediately after the cessation of

23:47.082 --> 24:02.683
hostilities, I would say that the military was at 
an all-time low in this country in the eyes of the

23:47.082 --> 24:02.683
citizen on the street. It was almost an insult to be 
in a uniform. I've been in airports and in public

24:06.288 --> 24:14.018
places in my uniform where people would people 
would drive by in the car and yell obscenities to

24:14.673 --> 24:18.257
you. No kidding. Instead of being- Was that at the 
end of the war? Early 70s? Yeah, in that time

24:22.643 --> 24:24.024
period. As a result, we're encouraged never to 
wear a uniform, especially a general officer

24:25.066 --> 24:34.097
never wears a uniform when he's going public 
transportation or what have you. No kidding. We

24:34.637 --> 24:40.244
always go in civilian clothes because, first of 
all- That's a response? That's a response of the

24:40.364 --> 24:43.669
post-Vietnam era? That- plus the increasing 
instance of terrorism. Now, not so much in this

24:48.619 --> 24:51.864
country, but overseas. You've made the General 
Dozier instance and things of that type. They

24:57.292 --> 25:05.244
don't like you to play up the fact that you're a 
general officer. In fact, I've worn this pin ever

25:06.225 --> 25:11.393
since my little tie pin with my star ever since I was 
promoted. Most of the general officers have a

25:11.913 --> 25:18.779
bumper sticker on the car with the number of stars 
that you're entitled to. First of all, because

25:18.839 --> 25:27.026
they give you preferred parking places at certain 
places, like from the officer's club, you know,

25:18.839 --> 25:27.026
you've got a reserved general officer, little 
bennies that go with it. But they're even talking

25:27.706 --> 25:38.435
now about eliminating those because they don't 
want you to be known as a general officer because of

25:27.706 --> 25:38.435
the potential for terrorist kidnapping or what 
have you. What does that do to morale? Well, you

25:40.177 --> 25:41.818
know, it's kind of... I mean, you've worked this 
long, and now you can't even wear your uniform.

25:48.693 --> 25:51.896
That really hasn't come into being yet. There's 
just some talk about it. I do know that they've

25:54.398 --> 25:59.543
issued bumper stickers now with the capital 
letter G on it instead of the star. Of course, it

25:59.623 --> 26:02.646
doesn't take very many brains to figure out what 
the G stands for.

26:05.428 --> 26:11.434
But it's not critical in this country, but in an 
overseas assignment, you have to assume that

26:11.920 --> 26:17.346
someone's trying to kill you or kidnap you all the 
time if you're a general officer. And it's not a bad

26:17.366 --> 26:20.609
assumption because it's true in a lot of places. 
Yeah. But here, when you're on public

26:22.912 --> 26:29.659
transportation, here, do you wear your uniform 
when you don't? No. And that's Air Force

26:30.440 --> 26:31.781
directive? Well, it's Air Force policy. I don't 
think there's anything in writing. It's just that

26:35.666 --> 26:40.611
when we have meetings, and we have meetings twice a 
year of all Air Force Reserve general officers,

26:40.979 --> 26:45.125
And they're mirrors almost of some of the active 
duty general officer meetings that they have.

26:46.467 --> 26:52.355
We're told that it's Air Force policy that you not 
travel in your military uniform on public

26:46.467 --> 26:52.355
conveyance. And when you travel in military 
aircraft, of course, then you have to have on

26:52.996 --> 26:56.341
uniform. But if you're riding public 
transportation, airplanes, trains, buses, you

26:56.581 --> 27:02.450
never travel in uniform. They even discourage 
full colonels from doing it. But general

27:05.133 --> 27:06.936
officers, you just don't do it. And it's because of 
the fact that you're going to get heckled by

27:07.658 --> 27:17.669
certain elements, not so much now as immediately 
right after the Vietnamese. But you know, it's

27:18.150 --> 27:28.001
almost unbelievable that someone in the uniform 
of their country, trying to serve their country,

27:18.150 --> 27:28.001
would be heckled for having that uniform on. I 
know. But it happens. I know.

27:33.764 --> 27:36.329
It's incredible, just a little aside here. But as I 
mentioned, that's when we hit rock bottom. And I

27:42.880 --> 27:45.024
think it's continued to improve since then. And I 
think that this country is on the verge of giving a

27:45.345 --> 27:58.388
lot of respect and having a lot of patriotic fervor 
that we've not had for years. I think that Reagan

27:59.684 --> 28:05.213
has really got his hands full on what he's going to 
do in Central and South America. I think that

28:05.233 --> 28:18.233
without any question in my mind, the threat in 
Central and South America is at least as

28:05.233 --> 28:18.233
substantial as Nazi Germany's threat during the 
Second World War and maybe worse because of its

28:05.233 --> 28:18.233
proximity to our country. To me, that threat far 
overshadows anything that Korea or Vietnam could

28:19.675 --> 28:24.062
have ever done to us. To me, this is the single most 
serious threat to our survival as a country that I

28:28.928 --> 28:36.298
can imagine. And yet we've got people in Congress 
right now that are saying, let those people work

28:36.318 --> 28:42.987
out their own problems. And it just doesn't work 
that way. Well, let's talk a little bit more about

28:46.092 --> 28:50.778
the draft and the volunteer army. And you have to 
forgive me for chasing these rabbits when they

28:51.519 --> 28:54.123
come. Oh, that's fine. I want your ideas and your 
opinions. I want your ideas on the draft. Do you

29:02.501 --> 29:04.363
think that we should reinstate the draft? Without 
any question, I'd do it before noon today if I had

29:04.663 --> 29:07.586
the authority. I see no reason why a certain 
segment of our society should defend this country

29:08.427 --> 29:16.296
and another segment, because of their affluence, 
never have to do it. I think that people from all

29:17.357 --> 29:28.028
walks of life should serve this country equally, 
either voluntarily or if they have to be made to do

29:17.357 --> 29:28.028
it, then let's make them do it. But we all know that

29:28.953 --> 29:38.284
the people in the lower economic stratus make up 
the bulk of the military. By the same token, you

29:39.005 --> 29:50.258
don't have that vast cross-section and the 
thinking and the expertise of a good

29:39.005 --> 29:50.258
cross-section of the country that we had during 
the draft. You've got a distorted view of what the

29:50.999 --> 29:56.646
world's all about because you're drawing from 
only one segment of the society. And I'm speaking

29:56.666 --> 29:58.588
primarily of the enlisted corps now. The officer 
corps, I think, you've got a pretty good cross

29:59.058 --> 30:02.403
section. The officer corps is pretty well 
educated, more so than the regular society,

30:03.364 --> 30:10.475
because you've got to have a college degree. And I 
would say that with rare exceptions, you'll never

30:10.575 --> 30:20.110
see anybody reach the rank of full colonel or above 
without a master's degree. For general officers,

30:20.550 --> 30:25.077
it's becoming more common that you have a PhD to 
become a general officer. And I don't have one, but

30:25.097 --> 30:27.681
I think in the future, That's almost going to be 
part of one of the squares to fill. But I don't think

30:31.517 --> 30:36.943
you'll ever see a full colonel, very many full 
colonels in the future without a master's degree.

30:38.385 --> 30:44.952
To me, this relates fairly well with what happens 
in the civilian segment of our society, not so in

30:38.385 --> 30:44.952
the enlisted grades. So back to your original 
question, I can't tell you how strongly I feel that

30:46.474 --> 30:52.541
we should reinstate the draft, even in peacetime. 
Now, it sounds to me that you see the draft more as

30:58.576 --> 31:07.468
Oh,

30:58.576 --> 31:07.468
something to increase the amount of citizenship. 
Absolutely. I think it's a civic responsibility

31:08.570 --> 31:11.914
to defend this country. And you also see it in 
class, as far as class terms. That is, the middle

31:17.802 --> 31:20.747
and the upper middle class. And upper class is a 
college, a suburban class. They don't have to

31:23.731 --> 31:25.693
serve, but others do. And you think that's unfair. 
I think it's unfair in that, first of all, I think

31:27.263 --> 31:35.173
every citizen has an obligation to do their share. 
But second of all, I think once people get into the

31:36.055 --> 31:41.422
military, that they themselves get something 
from it. I think those people are being deprived of

31:41.502 --> 31:47.209
the privilege of serving their country. And so I 
know a lot of people that say, boy, I would have

31:47.329 --> 31:53.878
never volunteered for that, but I'm sure glad I had 
the experience. And so you put someone in the

31:54.972 --> 32:00.919
position where they have to perform, and then 
later on, they're proud they had the experience.

32:01.259 --> 32:03.682
And they would not have done it had they not been 
made to do it. But I think that there's just no

32:04.803 --> 32:13.554
question whatsoever in my mind of, first of all, us 
having a better military if we did it that way.

32:14.214 --> 32:20.482
Because even if a guy doesn't want to do something, 
if he's placed in a position, most people can do the

32:14.214 --> 32:20.482
best they can with what they've got. And so I think 
that not only would we have a better military, But I

32:24.875 --> 32:32.426
think you'd have more patriotism in this country 
because more people would be touched with it in a

32:24.875 --> 32:32.426
direct basis. Wealthy families may go for 
generations without ever having a member of their

32:32.446 --> 32:37.894
family ever serve a day in the military. That's 
criminal. What a privilege that they've missed.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.083
What about women? Do you think women in America 
should also serve in the military? In today's

32:47.608 --> 32:48.869
environment, I do. I think they should be drafted 
right along with men. And here, once again, you've

32:53.292 --> 32:57.899
got the question of who you draft. But we've always 
had that question, and it worked relatively well.

33:02.005 --> 33:03.047
You register everyone. And the lottery wasn't a 
bad way to do it. At least you get a good cross

33:07.093 --> 33:08.876
section. I feel that whether anybody wants to 
admit it or not, there are differences between men

33:10.458 --> 33:18.290
and women. I think in combat situations where you 
are living off the land without any latrine

33:20.900 --> 33:28.410
facilities or anything like that, it would be a 
mistake to put women into a combat situation. But

33:28.430 --> 33:32.595
there are lots of ways they can serve without being 
in the trenches on the front lines. In other words,

33:33.316 --> 33:45.993
do you agree with old Harry Truman's idea of the 
universal military training, that everyone,

33:33.316 --> 33:45.993
when they turn a certain age, 18 or 19, should have a 
year or two of some sort of service to the country?

33:46.954 --> 33:49.658
Or do you think that's too broad and too expensive? 
I would like to see it, but I think from a practical

33:50.313 --> 33:55.438
standpoint that that would be too expensive. I 
feel that everyone should register, that there

33:56.459 --> 34:11.234
possibly should be a certain amount of 
indoctrination required in conjunction with

33:56.459 --> 34:11.234
that registration, maybe a half a day of some very 
basics about what our country is all about. And

34:12.315 --> 34:19.763
then if they're fortunate enough or unfortunate 
enough, depending on how they view it, to be

34:12.315 --> 34:19.763
selected for the draft, then I think that should be 
done. so that you've got a good cross-section of

34:20.249 --> 34:26.637
this country defending the country. And not only 
that individual, but also the impact that

34:26.657 --> 34:33.986
individual has on his immediate family and his 
neighbors and friends and what have you. There are

34:34.006 --> 34:44.519
parts of Houston that you could go into and 
probably go for 40 houses, and they don't have

34:34.006 --> 34:44.519
anybody in the military and never have had anybody 
in the military since the draft. It's not right.

34:49.605 --> 34:49.885
So... You probably didn't want to know that. I want 
all that. As a matter of fact, I have very similar

34:54.957 --> 34:59.247
feelings. Being a veteran, I have very similar 
feelings on that. And I want to know this. There's

35:05.727 --> 35:07.810
another thing that I'd like to know. Sometimes, 
especially during the Vietnamese War, a lot of

35:07.850 --> 35:15.402
journalists said that there was such a thing as a 
military mentality. That was usually the term

35:15.783 --> 35:20.230
they used, that there was a way that the military 
thinks about it. Well, you're both in an

35:20.250 --> 35:28.103
institution and you're in another institution, 
the military, and I was wondering what you

35:20.250 --> 35:28.103
thought. Is there such a thing as a military 
mentality, and if so, what is it? I would think that

35:33.605 --> 35:49.464
if there is such a thing, that it would be a normal 
outgrowth of having been in a profession for a

35:33.605 --> 35:49.464
number of years in which you tend to accept the 
policies that are established by the military

35:33.605 --> 35:49.464
establishment as your own policies. I don't mean 
that people follow the party line right down to the

35:50.806 --> 35:59.697
nth degree, but chances are,

36:01.347 --> 36:11.740
Just like here, if Dr. Vannevar wants to do 
something, I don't have any strong objections not

36:01.347 --> 36:11.740
to do it, well then I adopt that as my policy because 
I'm supporting Dr. Vannevar and his ideas. The

36:12.341 --> 36:13.682
same thing is true in the military. I would say that

36:14.744 --> 36:22.073
you wouldn't find any difference in the military 
way of responding to suggestions and policies

36:22.492 --> 36:28.099
adopted by their superiors than you would find in 
the civilian sector. OK. And I wanted to ask you

36:28.119 --> 36:32.704
another question on that, as far as advancement. 
You've advanced substantially in both the

36:32.885 --> 36:39.192
military and in university. And before that, you 
were for Sears and Roebuck. Now I'm wondering, and

36:42.676 --> 36:46.981
for a while you even had your own company. I'm 
wondering if it's the same type

36:51.972 --> 36:59.179
characteristics that make someone a success in 
the military as in private or in public

36:51.972 --> 36:59.179
institutions? Absolutely. I don't think there's 
any difference. I think it's a situation of

37:01.722 --> 37:08.369
learning a skill, filling the squares, doing the 
job. But to me, I think that success in private

37:08.389 --> 37:21.102
business, success within a corporate structure, 
or success in the military, assuming that you're

37:08.389 --> 37:21.102
doing the technical side of your job, is primarily 
a matter of attitude and personality, human

37:21.655 --> 37:27.100
relations. Those things are 80% of it. Only 20% of 
it is skill and knowledge, in my opinion. And

37:34.226 --> 37:36.188
that's true in the military or wherever you go.

37:39.791 --> 37:49.840
When you think back on your career, which of course 
isn't completed yet, but when you think back on it,

37:39.791 --> 37:49.840
do you see yourself now as ambitious?

37:54.173 --> 37:54.974
That's a hard one. Sure is. I don't see myself as 
ambitious for ambition's sake to attain a

37:57.137 --> 38:14.702
certain, in other words, I've never had the 
ambition to be a two-star general for the sake of

37:57.137 --> 38:14.702
just saying, look at me, I'm a two-star general. 
I'm ambitious from the point that I like

38:15.643 --> 38:19.309
responsibility. I like accomplishing work. I 
like delegating and working through people. And

38:23.975 --> 38:34.991
I'd be less than honest if I didn't say that I like a 
certain amount of authority to be able to direct

38:23.975 --> 38:34.991
things and make things happen that I think should 
happen. But as a result of doing these things, if

38:36.072 --> 38:42.782
promotions and recognition come as a result, then 
that's great. But that's not the primary goal. The

38:46.087 --> 38:52.716
goal is to do something, hopefully that would be a 
benefit to whatever organization I'm talking

38:46.087 --> 38:52.716
about, whether it be the military, whether it be 
Texas A&M, whether it be my church, whether it be my

38:53.050 --> 38:57.195
family. Do the best you can with the jobs at hand, 
and then if recognition and promotions come, well

38:58.757 --> 39:04.583
and good. Well, did you leave on the way up the 
ladder then to success, did you leave that

39:04.904 --> 39:19.340
advancement to fate or luck, or do you think that 
that advancement was because you accomplished

39:04.904 --> 39:19.340
those individual tasks? I think I think the 
accomplishment of individual tasks was only part

39:21.265 --> 39:26.893
of it. I think the secret to my advancement and the 
secret to almost anyone's advancement

39:28.275 --> 39:47.982
has a whole lot to do with proximity to power 
sources, knowing people that are in a position to

39:28.275 --> 39:47.982
promote you, knowing people that are in a position 
to recommend you for certain jobs, doing a job that

39:49.784 --> 39:57.152
they become aware of, whether it's from their own 
initiative or whether you make sure that they are

39:49.784 --> 39:57.152
aware of what you're doing. I have no big hang up 
with blowing your own horn, as long as it's done for

39:58.354 --> 40:08.526
the proper motives and as long as it's honest and 
true. As long as you're not inflating yourself.

40:13.051 --> 40:13.311
That's right. That's right. Of course, we're on 
another thin sheet of ice here. That's true. On

40:17.054 --> 40:27.030
what is the question between realistically 
saying, here's what I have achieved, and then

40:17.054 --> 40:27.030
inflating what you've done and boasting. That's 
right. It's a matter of personal

40:28.112 --> 40:36.646
integrity as to whether you do that or not. Chances 
are you could. But almost always, when you inflate

40:40.055 --> 40:43.079
something, it's going to catch up with you. And our 
superiors should see it. That's true. But I would

40:47.804 --> 40:58.036
think that not being afraid to speak up, to 
introduce yourself six, eight, 10 times if

40:47.804 --> 40:58.036
necessary, until somebody learns your name. I got 
real tickled at the last board meeting. I was to

41:04.163 --> 41:09.910
give a report to the board on the parking 
conditions over and around the vet college. And

41:11.341 --> 41:14.625
I've only been a vice president since last 
October, so I don't know all the board. Well, I know

41:14.705 --> 41:16.767
all the board members, but they all don't know me. 
So I've had a great deal of difficulty in the few

41:17.348 --> 41:21.893
times that they are on campus for them to learn my 
name. And most of them know my face and know that I'm

41:22.554 --> 41:27.440
connected with the physical plant in some way or 
the police, but they don't know my name. So

41:28.401 --> 41:41.196
finally, I'd introduce myself to Mr.

41:28.401 --> 41:41.196
Joe Richardson, who's the chairman of our 
building committee a number of times, and just a

41:28.401 --> 41:41.196
super guy. And so it came to my part on the program. 
He says, OK. He says, I've asked Dr. Vandiver to put

41:45.036 --> 41:53.285
together a report on parking conditions and a 
petition that some of the vet students had put

41:45.036 --> 41:53.285
together for us. And he says, and he's asked Chuck 
to give the report. And I thought, thank goodness.

41:56.849 --> 41:58.931
Boy, he finally learned my name. He says, and now to 
give the report is Chuck McCandless. So I thought,

42:02.775 --> 42:04.858
well, I'm halfway home. So Dr. Vandiver corrected 
him. And then he later on told me he's sure sorry

42:05.899 --> 42:09.443
that he tried to remember my name as Cargill. But 
anyway. There's all the board members sitting

42:11.433 --> 42:18.342
around, so I'll probably be Chuck McCandless to 
them for the rest of their life because, of course,

42:11.433 --> 42:18.342
Chuck has appeared before the board a number of 
times. But name recognition is so important.

42:23.769 --> 42:27.854
Letting people know that you want to do what you can 
to help them with their programs. If you can help

42:29.196 --> 42:35.103
enough other people get what they want, then 
you'll get what you want. It's a service-oriented

42:35.223 --> 42:41.271
type philosophy, but you've also got to be a little 
bit pushy in letting people know that, Hey, if

42:41.892 --> 42:44.515
there's something else I can do to help you with 
that, let me know. Be willing to accept the

42:45.256 --> 42:50.182
responsibility and help the guy with his 
problems, and he'll love you for it. And he'll

42:51.764 --> 42:52.766
promote you for it. And it's something that you're 
accomplishing your objectives to, and that's to

42:54.948 --> 42:59.775
be of more service to whatever organization it may 
be. I want to talk about that and accomplishments.

43:04.775 --> 43:16.833
When you look back on your career in the military, 
and of course this is a question that's premature

43:04.775 --> 43:16.833
because you might be at the point of your career 
where you're going to have the most impact on the

43:04.775 --> 43:16.833
Air Force. But when you look back at your career, 
what do you see as accomplishments

43:17.574 --> 43:27.188
in the reserves? And I also want you to think, was 
there anything that you thought were

43:28.449 --> 43:32.976
shortcomings? I would think that probably the 
period of time, not a specific instance, but a

43:34.053 --> 43:52.514
period of time in which a number of things happened 
that I point to with pride more than just about any

43:34.053 --> 43:52.514
other, was the time that I served as a full colonel 
at 10th Air Force Headquarters as Director of

43:34.053 --> 43:52.514
Logistics Plan for the 10th Air Force. During that 
period of time, we performed what we call staff

43:53.415 --> 43:59.062
assistance visits to our units, which were all 
over the United States. We had put together a team

43:59.803 --> 44:01.765
from the headquarters. And as a full colonel, I was 
frequently the team chief, which is another way of

44:02.167 --> 44:08.294
saying the highest-ranking guy in charge of the 
team. Anywhere from 20 to 40 people would come on an

44:09.135 --> 44:13.140
airplane, and we'd go visit our units. They called 
them inspections, and that's really what they

44:14.001 --> 44:16.184
were. But we didn't like the word inspection. We 
called them staff assistance visits. And they say

44:21.029 --> 44:29.980
the two biggest lies ever told in the Air Force is 
when the team gets off, the team chief said, we're

44:21.029 --> 44:29.980
here to help you, and the guy that you're visiting 
said, we're glad to see you. And those are the two

44:30.871 --> 44:32.634
biggest lies I've ever told. But anyway. But 
during that period of time, when I was team chief,

44:34.838 --> 44:44.575
visiting these units all over the United States, I 
consider that to be my most productive time as far

44:34.838 --> 44:44.575
as making a contribution. Because, of course, 
those of us that were specialists in certain areas

44:44.595 --> 44:55.815
could go in and look at their records, look at their 
programs, look at their in-commission rates and

44:44.595 --> 44:55.815
so forth. check some of their supplies to see how 
long it's been since certain wear date items like

44:56.420 --> 45:04.291
rubber can't stay in a kit too long because it gets 
hard and you've got to replace it. And those kinds

45:05.192 --> 45:11.340
of things, I feel we've really made a contribution 
toward the readiness of the reserve program. But I

45:11.360 --> 45:15.265
look at that as my most productive time as far as 
making a contribution. When you become a general

45:16.147 --> 45:20.372
officer, you've got to define the word general. It 
means a general officer as opposed to a specialist

45:20.993 --> 45:24.638
officer. Up to that point, you're a specialist in 
some field. You become a general officer. You

45:29.025 --> 45:29.967
could be in personnel. You could be in supply. You 
could be anywhere. Because supposedly, you have a

45:32.692 --> 45:39.825
broad enough concept of the entire picture, the 
big picture, that you could fit in anywhere. And

45:39.974 --> 45:42.760
the active Air Force uses its people that way, too. 
My boss right now at Tinker Air Force Base was at SAC

45:43.021 --> 45:48.173
headquarters. Never has spent one day in supply, 
but yet he's a commander of one of the largest

45:48.213 --> 45:55.890
supply and maintenance operations in the entire 
world.
