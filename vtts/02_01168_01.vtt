00:04.823 --> 00:11.052
Okay, this is Ron Shorin at the American Astronaut 
Society meeting in Berkeley, California on June

00:04.823 --> 00:11.052
9, 1993. I'm going to interview Don Wells. So, Don, 
for the record, would you give us your full name? My

00:16.880 --> 00:19.584
name is Donald C. Wells. That's how I usually use my 
name professionally. I'm 51 years old. I was born

00:27.471 --> 00:28.713
in 1941. Where? In Texas. I'm a native Texan from 
Beaumont, Texas. I entered graduate school in

00:35.643 --> 00:38.047
astronomy. Let's just go back. I wanted to ask you, 
where you got first interested in astronomy? Oh,

00:42.774 --> 00:45.137
now there's an interesting question. Actually, I 
don't know. I grew up in the 50s reading Heinlein

00:46.319 --> 00:53.089
and other science fiction writers. was really 
fascinated by space and that sort of thing. But

00:59.057 --> 01:01.240
actually, I think the interest goes deeper. And I 
was always after kind of ultimate things and the

01:01.300 --> 01:10.192
limits. And in fact, the result of that is in 
astronomy, I went toward cosmology. So for me, I

01:15.620 --> 01:21.167
viewed planets as one little step along the way, 
and I was really after cosmology. That was how I

01:21.207 --> 01:23.430
originally thought. And so I gravitated in that 
direction. But actually, as a young person, I

01:27.001 --> 01:35.030
didn't know anything about how people became 
astronomers.

01:36.032 --> 01:42.078
And so as I was in high school and I studied physics, 
then I knew about physics. I also grew up in a heavy

01:42.098 --> 01:44.561
industry area. And so engineers were the highly 
honored people in that environment.

01:49.327 --> 01:52.270
Intellectuals were unknown. And so the highest 
goal was to be an engineer. And the net effect of

01:55.617 --> 02:02.108
that was when I went off to university education, I 
thought the object of the game was to be an

01:55.617 --> 02:02.108
engineer. Where did you do your undergraduate 
work? I went to Rice. And I started in EE. And this

02:09.480 --> 02:11.083
would have been 1960. I graduated from high school 
in 1960. And so I originally started in double E.

02:14.947 --> 02:25.678
And in a freshman physics course, I became 
terrifically fascinated with Newtonian physics

02:14.947 --> 02:25.678
and all the basic physics stuff. And that just 
resonated real deeply. And so I switched to

02:28.061 --> 02:29.502
physics. And however, I have all through my life 
thought and acted a lot like an engineer in many

02:30.643 --> 02:37.070
ways. So I'm a kind of hybrid person in between 
engineering and physics. But my real love is

02:42.368 --> 02:45.292
physics in the end. When you graduated, where did 
you go to grad school? I graduated in 1964. I

02:50.838 --> 02:54.102
applied to two places for grad school. I should 
have applied for more. I must say that as a physics

02:56.445 --> 03:10.823
major, as I approached my senior year, I actually

02:56.445 --> 03:10.823
came to the realization that I didn't really want 
to do what most physicists did. And I was groping

03:11.393 --> 03:19.827
around, and I had an astrophysics course in about 
my senior year, junior year, senior year. And I

03:20.848 --> 03:25.315
didn't actually know anything about how to be an 
astronomer. And that's an interesting

03:25.936 --> 03:38.717
commentary, that I was a physics student in the 
60s, early 60s, and there was essentially at that

03:25.936 --> 03:38.717
time almost no information available to me about 
how to become an astronomer. One of my professors,

03:38.967 --> 03:51.041
he was a department chairman at the time, I asked 
him, and he had a fellow grad student when he was in

03:38.967 --> 03:51.041
school who had become an astronomer. And so he had 
some knowledge of what you did to be an astronomer.

03:54.546 --> 03:55.707
And he gave me a few hints. And with that, I was off 
and running. I right away discovered where the

03:57.409 --> 04:00.353
grad schools were and applied. Texas offered me 
money. The other place I applied didn't offer me

04:02.695 --> 04:08.282
money, although it was Wisconsin, as it happens. 
In retrospect, had I gone to Wisconsin, I almost

04:08.583 --> 04:14.889
certainly would have been in the OAO program. They 
would have paid me in the end, and I would have wound

04:14.949 --> 04:22.296
up doing probably ultraviolet astronomy, and who 
knows? I'd have gone into the space side of

04:22.376 --> 04:25.559
astronomy more directly. Instead, I went to Texas 
and went into the ground-based side of astronomy.

04:30.123 --> 04:36.109
So it's one of those little things, you know, flip 
of the coin, you'd go one way or the other. When I

04:36.359 --> 04:44.250
went to Texas, one of my very first courses was from 
Gerard de Vaucouleur. And it was on extragalactic

04:46.272 --> 04:48.195
astronomy. And I just gravitated right to that. 
And Gerard had a planetary side as well. And he was,

04:56.486 --> 05:03.936
even then, at that time, doing, for example, a map 
of Mars, as I recall. He had an artist busy drawing

05:04.507 --> 05:09.873
maps of visual observations of Mars at that time. 
Anyway, you were starting to ask a question. What

05:14.779 --> 05:16.842
did you do your thesis on? Oh, you mean in grad 
school? Yeah. Actually, I did two theses, or tried

05:18.544 --> 05:21.988
two different things. I started on a thesis on blue 
galaxies as Mercurian-type galaxies with Dan

05:23.450 --> 05:34.463
Weidman, who was a young professor then at I guess 
he was an assistant professor in the Department of

05:34.797 --> 05:37.822
Texas. And he decided right in the midst of that to 
take a position at Penn State. So he got a tenure

05:47.158 --> 05:49.582
track offer at Penn State. And off he goes to Penn 
State. And I decided not to follow him. I decided to

05:52.807 --> 05:54.510
stay at Texas. At that point, I gave up on the 
original thesis. It wasn't working out too well

05:57.826 --> 05:59.369
anyway. The universe wasn't cooperating. And so 
Gerard offered me a suggestion, and I went with

06:02.333 --> 06:13.449
Gerard, and I did spectrophotometry of galaxies 
to get K corrections, and that was cosmology. I was

06:13.670 --> 06:18.937
directly a part of observational cosmology, so I 
was really an observational cosmology person.

06:19.919 --> 06:22.202
And I wound up doing a postdoc in that, But my other 
big love was computing. So all through the midst of

06:25.322 --> 06:32.451
all this, I had a really heavy interest in 
computing. Totally self-taught, but at a very

06:32.491 --> 06:35.435
high level. And so ultimately, my whole career has 
been divided between science and computing. And

06:42.925 --> 06:45.608
computing is mostly one over the years. I remember 
you were in the bowels of the 107-inch when that

06:46.162 --> 06:51.436
thing was getting going. What did you do on that 
project? I was a co-designer, builder,

06:55.387 --> 07:00.019
programmer, of the control software for the 
107-inch, pointing the machine and moving it

07:00.252 --> 07:10.455
around, get it on targets, doing pointing 
calculations, that sort of thing. I had a partner

07:10.515 --> 07:14.263
who was a long-time friend of mine named Mike 
McCants. He and I did that project. an early

07:18.072 --> 07:22.358
computer-controlled telescope in optical 
astronomy. In Harlan's tapes and transcripts,

07:22.378 --> 07:36.739
Harlan Smith, he states that Westinghouse 
completely fouled up the control system and

07:22.378 --> 07:36.739
people had to basically start from scratch. He may 
be speaking of things like the servos and that sort

07:37.411 --> 07:40.717
of thing. And I seem to recall that he had an 
engineer who did build a digital servo system for

07:41.399 --> 07:50.977
the telescope, and that that was a somewhat 
innovative thing in that time. Now, that's the

07:51.458 --> 07:54.323
actual servo controls. We were at a higher level, 
so if you wanted to observe Venus, we built a

07:54.725 --> 08:22.335
control system where you could say, point Venus, 
and it would work out an ephemeris, calculate the

07:54.725 --> 08:22.335
current apparent position, apply all the 
corrections for the telescope's pointing

07:54.725 --> 08:22.335
errors, and command the servo system to move the 
machine to that position and set the tracking

07:54.725 --> 08:22.335
rates so that it would track the moving target. So 
we could work out all those kind of higher-level

08:22.315 --> 08:26.682
calculations. That's what I mean by the control 
system. But an engineer who was responsible for

08:29.386 --> 08:35.655
the servos, for motor control, would think that it 
was the digital servo loops. That may be what

08:36.356 --> 08:39.381
Harlan was referring to. I don't think our part of 
the project was something that Westinghouse

08:39.501 --> 08:44.609
would have ever been responsible for. It was 
always going to be our job. So once the mechanical

08:46.011 --> 08:49.637
end of the telescope was done, then you people took 
over. Yeah. Yes. It was a pure software effort.

08:54.542 --> 09:02.554
Although we were concerned about the pointing 
errors, the mechanical errors of the machine,

08:54.542 --> 09:02.554
which are inevitable, and calibrating those and 
accounting for them. The reason I'm interested in

09:03.055 --> 09:07.662
this is, of course, that that was funded with NASA 
money. Yes. Through planetary astronomy. Right.

09:10.867 --> 09:19.339
One of the most innovative things we did in that 
software, which is almost unmatched, I think,

09:10.867 --> 09:19.339
elsewhere, was that we had an ability to point at 
targets on the moon. There's practically no other

09:24.804 --> 09:27.849
telescope control system that ever did. I've 
never actually heard of one that did that. But

09:30.633 --> 09:41.352
because of the Lunar Laser Ranging Program, it was 
necessary to hit targets at points on the moon,

09:30.633 --> 09:41.352
accounting for current lunar ephemeris. Where is 
the moon, and what is its orientation, and where

09:41.532 --> 09:45.158
are we? where are the features, or where is the 
reflection? Yeah, right. So we had xi, eta

09:48.202 --> 09:51.685
coordinates in the coordinate system of the moon. 
So you could pick out a crater on the moon, and you'd

09:51.725 --> 09:59.472
look up at xi, eta coordinates, and you could say, 
point moon xi, eta, you know, xi this, eta that. So

09:59.492 --> 10:04.397
you'd say where on the moon you wanted to go, and we 
had named features, and we had a table. I think we

10:04.497 --> 10:13.845
had named features for some of the objects on the 
moon, and you had a table of their coordinates, so

10:04.497 --> 10:13.845
you could say, point at them by name on the moon, you 
know, a crater by name. And that was really pretty

10:14.062 --> 10:23.244
exotic to do a calculation of where the objects 
would be in apparent coordinates and also their

10:14.062 --> 10:23.244
tracking rates. And then the next part of the story 
is that many of the targets you wanted to fire at

10:23.966 --> 10:31.564
were on the dark side of the moon, so you couldn't 
even see them. And you had unknown pointing errors

10:32.236 --> 10:39.127
because in spite of all our efforts to calibrate 
the machine, there's uncalibratable errors. So

10:39.187 --> 10:44.115
what you do is you offset from a visible source to 
the invisible source. And so, in fact, what we

10:44.956 --> 10:52.708
would do is point at a bright object, an object on 
the bright side, the illuminated side, zero the

10:44.956 --> 10:52.708
crosshairs on it. tell the computer, now note the 
zero error, now go to this other guy that's over

10:53.195 --> 11:01.664
here in the dark, in the shadow, and that's where 
they were going to fire the laser. And we could do

11:02.044 --> 11:07.971
all this in the summer of 1969 at Apollo 11. As I 
recall at that time, there were a number of other

11:07.991 --> 11:18.662
observatories that were trying to do the same 
thing, and they did not have this kind of control

11:07.991 --> 11:18.662
system, and eventually some of them got returns. 
um laser returns but as i recall they kind of once

11:18.946 --> 11:44.970
they got their picture in the paper they kind of 
gave up because it was just too hard to do without

11:18.946 --> 11:44.970
this control system that you had maybe it was maybe 
it was i i'm on i i didn't know much about that

11:18.946 --> 11:44.970
because we were just support personnel for the 
activity we thought my partner and i mike mckenzie

11:18.946 --> 11:44.970
and i thought it was a wonderful fascinating 
control and computing problem And we were in

11:45.254 --> 11:49.061
uncharted territory, and we loved it because we 
knew we could do it. We believed it was all going to

11:49.603 --> 11:53.851
work, and it did, and it was all a fascinating 
problem for us. But we ourselves weren't all that

11:55.314 --> 12:00.023
interested in planetary work. We viewed the whole 
thing as an interesting logical problem,

12:00.374 --> 12:08.488
mathematical and physical problem to stretch our 
minds on. On the other hand, it would have been very

12:08.749 --> 12:16.482
difficult to do routine lunar ranging work or 
routine Venus stuff without this control system.

12:16.983 --> 12:23.795
Did anybody, the people who used the stuff you 
made, did they ever give you any credit in print? I

12:23.815 --> 12:24.576
do not know. I do not know. Because it's my theory 
that people like you and Bob Toll and John Geary and

12:27.036 --> 12:37.869
CFA and everybody like that do all this stuff 
without which, quote, observers can't observe.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.093
And you're invisible people as far as that works 
out. There's a lot of truth to this. Like, that

12:43.475 --> 12:50.043
lunar laser ranging data is mostly going to appear 
in a table in some A.J. or some other journal,

12:50.123 --> 12:55.069
probably under the author of Daryl Mulholland, 
somebody like that. And it's going to appear as a

12:57.491 --> 13:03.019
set of precision results and model fits and that 
sort of thing. And that's the ultimate result of

13:03.059 --> 13:05.281
it. And along the way, you know, he just announces 
this came from the 107 inch and probably doesn't

13:05.942 --> 13:12.851
say much more than that. And I mean, how can I fault 
him? This has been standard practice forever. Do

13:20.201 --> 13:25.107
you get to publish some of this stuff in like the 
Journal for Computer Control of Telescopes or

13:20.201 --> 13:25.107
whatever? Not in that era. Nowadays,

13:27.409 --> 13:35.440
well, in the last decade or so, there is more of a 
mechanism. First, for example, in the AAS,

13:36.782 --> 13:50.622
there's a thing called the Working Group for 
Astronomical Software, which was first proposed

13:36.782 --> 13:50.622
by Ivan King when he was president of the society in 
1980. And I was the first chairman of that working

13:51.243 --> 13:54.428
group. For about five years, I was chairman of it. 
And one of the goals of that group was to provide a

13:57.834 --> 14:06.468
forum where astronomical software people could 
get together and talk and get some kind of

13:57.834 --> 14:06.468
recognition. And over the years, the WGAS has 
promoted, particularly under Bob Hennish, who's

14:07.490 --> 14:14.922
the current chairman, promoted some of this kind 
of activity of journal recognition, paper

14:15.138 --> 14:20.826
publication. So in this AAS meeting on Monday, 
there were poster paper sessions that were WGAS

14:20.886 --> 14:33.866
related, and there was a paper session, oral paper 
session on Monday morning that was WGAS related.

14:33.966 --> 14:38.192
And in it, software people in astronomy got to talk 
about what they were doing. But this is a

14:38.645 --> 14:40.768
continuing problem. We haven't really solved it. 
Also, it's true that under this era of the last

14:43.232 --> 15:06.407
decade with Bob Hanisch, and not just WGS, but 
equivalent groups in Europe, for example, have

14:43.232 --> 15:06.407
also recognized the problem, and they've 
pestered the journals, the publication

14:43.232 --> 15:06.407
committees, and there's been a broadening of the 
guidelines of what's publishable, what is

14:43.232 --> 15:06.407
considered appropriate for our journals. And so 
in principle, the policies in print now say that

15:06.387 --> 15:16.293
instrumentation papers of this kind, including 
software things, not just optical instruments.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.722
Somebody could always publish a paper on a new 
spectrometer. but software sort of arose in the

15:20.393 --> 15:26.182
more recent period and they weren't quite sure how 
we fit into the picture. Well, now the policies say

15:26.302 --> 15:29.908
that these things are publishable. And so it's not 
finished. The solution's not completely in hand,

15:33.113 --> 15:36.398
but there's a lot of improvement. This situation 
really never arose in radio astronomy because if

15:36.819 --> 15:46.314
you had some new deal, you would publish it in the 
proceedings of the IRE. The software people...

15:48.541 --> 15:50.488
No, I'm not so sure I agree. The hardware people, 
yes. They had a long tradition on the hardware

15:52.555 --> 15:54.983
side. So if they built a new receiver, they could 
certainly publish it in an engineering journal.

16:01.315 --> 16:07.004
There's comparatively little papers on the 
software side of systems. And that's somewhat

16:07.565 --> 16:16.539
true even today, that there's still not a full 
recognition for software as a form of

16:07.565 --> 16:16.539
instrumentation. That's really the issue that 
you're coming to. And in fact, that's the way I view

16:18.562 --> 16:21.728
it. I view software as a form of instrumentation 
And in the last two decades, it's become sine qua

16:24.552 --> 16:31.149
non, just like all the other instrumentation. And 
in fact, this is generally agreed to and

16:31.210 --> 16:35.220
understood. But however, the tradition of 
publishing papers around it is not as fully

16:35.538 --> 16:42.467
developed as it ought to be. The software is kind of 
amorphous. It's mind stuff, ultimate mind stuff.

16:47.413 --> 16:48.915
It's not tangible objects. Tangible objects are 
easy to write about. Amorphous mind stuff is

16:51.879 --> 16:54.042
slippery. You can't pin it down exactly. Even with 
hardware, as you know, Bob Tull was so busy

16:56.164 --> 17:04.515
building equipment for people like me to use. 
among others, that he was refused tenure because

17:04.917 --> 17:10.505
he didn't write enough papers about the sky. And 
that's with hard work, OK, which was a better

17:11.045 --> 17:15.451
position than software. And I'll say one thing for 
Harlan that he realized that without Bob Tall, the

17:15.511 --> 17:22.761
conservatory would be in some trouble. I was a 
member of the first generation that had this

17:23.061 --> 17:27.507
problem on the software side. I made a decision. 
While I was in grad school, actually, I decided

17:31.698 --> 17:43.302
that the main thing that I could do for science was 
to specialize in information handling. In that

17:45.587 --> 17:47.631
era, that was a pretty... foolhardy

17:48.387 --> 17:56.996
decision to make, although it was a straight 
calculation on my part of what the future was going

17:48.387 --> 17:56.996
to bring. The calculation was dead accurate. I was 
right on the mark. I knew what was going to happen.

18:01.641 --> 18:03.783
All my predictions were basically correct. 
However, I also knew that meant that I wasn't

18:05.205 --> 18:08.909
tenure-tracked. And I understood that 
consequence of the calculation, too. And

18:13.430 --> 18:27.751
although I made a half-hearted attempt to go for 
tenure, kind of, to play the academic game, I

18:13.430 --> 18:27.751
wasn't really capable of being simultaneously a 
bona fide research scientist and also a software

18:13.430 --> 18:27.751
instrumentation person. It was just too much. I 
wasn't good enough. Do you think this is a hangover

18:29.714 --> 18:36.023
from the days of, like, Galileo and Herschel, when 
an astronomer did everything? He built his

18:36.084 --> 18:40.450
telescope, he observed, he did this, did that. 
Back when it was easier to do that, of course. I

18:43.765 --> 18:46.349
agree with you that you can't do it these days. OK. 
It's too hard. So I ultimately gave up on, I gave up

18:48.211 --> 18:55.362
mentally on the idea of going for tenure. I 
acknowledged that I was never going to get it. I

18:57.505 --> 19:01.290
actually had no idea how I was going to survive 
because When I entered graduate school, there was

19:01.422 --> 19:13.399
no mechanism of employment in astronomy that 
could find a way for you to have a position, a

19:01.422 --> 19:13.399
permanent position, that wasn't tenure track. 
You alluded to Bob. He had exactly the same

19:14.540 --> 19:16.623
problem. And yet, he became a research associate 
and was put on the observatory payroll and, as a

19:17.184 --> 19:27.919
practical matter, had tenure, although 
officially he didn't. Personally, one result of

19:28.321 --> 19:40.913
all this is that I'm kind of scornful of the notion 
of academic tenure and think that oftentimes it's

19:28.321 --> 19:40.913
given to people who then sit around for another 20 
years. Whereas folk like Bob and me sort of have to

19:41.332 --> 19:46.920
continually re-justify our existence. When one 
project ends, there's probably another one

19:47.661 --> 19:52.808
coming, and we'll have to once again prove 
ourselves. And it's a little bit of a strain. One

19:54.851 --> 19:56.534
gets tired of it after a while. But on the other 
hand, there's also a sense of fairness about it.

20:01.020 --> 20:05.366
The notion of academic tenure, I'm not all that 
fond of the notion. I think the arguments for it are

20:05.567 --> 20:08.571
a little self-serving. But anyway, people like 
Bob Toll on the instrumentation side and me on the

20:08.787 --> 20:22.947
software instrumentation side did have a problem 
with how... The fundamental way of saying the

20:22.967 --> 20:27.253
problem was there weren't job titles for us. If you 
just looked in the roster of job titles that the

20:27.273 --> 20:33.141
personnel office had, there wasn't any box to put 
us into. And this was recognized by the

20:33.121 --> 20:37.128
observatories. It was understood that in this era 
of high-tech systems, large-scale systems that

20:37.149 --> 20:48.109
were complex, involved a lot of technologies, and 
there was rapid evolution of the technologies, it

20:48.376 --> 21:00.131
was understood that you were going to have to have a 
cadre of technical people who were in the

20:48.376 --> 21:00.131
structure more or less permanently, and that you 
just simply weren't going to operate without

20:48.376 --> 21:00.131
them. And so the administrators came to the 
conclusion they had to create some new job titles,

21:00.792 --> 21:06.680
and they did. Bob, I think, was always a research 
associate, but for software people like me, there

21:07.361 --> 21:14.350
weren't any job titles. Actually, big 
institutions really did have the problem even for

21:14.633 --> 21:18.440
the hardware guys. There were people like me who 
were bona fide astronomers, who did read the table

21:19.101 --> 21:35.190
of contents of the AppJ as it came on the shelf every 
month, who understood the physics and the

21:19.101 --> 21:35.190
astronomy and actually did care about it a lot. but 
who were, in fact, systems people. And

21:38.396 --> 21:41.920
observatories had to make decisions about that. 
And in the US, I was one of the first people to get a

21:42.100 --> 21:46.666
new job title. It was Support Scientist was the 
name given for it. And what institution? This was

21:53.214 --> 21:55.317
at Kitt Peak National Observatory. When did you 
leave Texas? I graduated from Texas in September

21:57.159 --> 22:00.203
of 72. That was when I had my oral exam. And I was at 
Texas eight years. I was in grad school eight

22:06.534 --> 22:08.217
years. That was a long, long time. One reason was an 
aborted dissertation that only started and

22:10.621 --> 22:17.411
didn't go too far. The second reason was that 
throughout the eight years, I worked half time. In

22:21.979 --> 22:27.267
fact, I built a telescope control system, which is 
not the sort of thing you'd expect a grad student to

22:21.979 --> 22:27.267
do. I built half a dozen or more instrument control 
systems. It may have been eight or ten of them. I did

22:33.645 --> 22:35.308
a whole series of projects. I had substantial 
published papers. I'd done almost every kind of

22:37.351 --> 22:42.478
computing, data reduction, instrument control, 
telescope control. I'd even done astrophysics

22:42.578 --> 22:48.647
calculations, stark broadening functions with a 
kind of theoretical approach. paper where I was

22:48.880 --> 22:51.804
the computing person. So I'd done all kinds of 
computing, and I'd been employed as a computing

22:51.824 --> 23:02.517
person for eight years throughout the time I was in 
grad school, which is a large part of the reason why

22:51.824 --> 23:02.517
I was in grad school a very long time. So I graduated 
in 72, September of 72, and I went to Kitt Peak as a

23:03.638 --> 23:14.432
postdoc, and

23:16.252 --> 23:26.985
I was doing cosmology observations, but they were 
at that time bringing the Mayall 4 meter online,

23:16.252 --> 23:26.985
and they actually didn't have very many people 
with skills like mine. One of the reasons they'd

23:27.005 --> 23:33.072
hired me was they wanted to get my kind of skills 
because they knew they needed them. And so I just

23:34.494 --> 23:37.037
gravitated into the Mayall 4 meter. I was the 
software designer on the control system for the

23:37.197 --> 23:42.383
Mayall 4 meter, the first original control 
system. So you got your new title, what, after a

23:42.644 --> 23:44.706
year? Yeah, they acknowledged that they had to 
invent a new title. So I became a support

23:48.664 --> 23:53.150
scientist, and I spent nine years at Kitt Peak. I 
was a software designer, built image processing

23:54.391 --> 24:00.859
systems, instrument control systems, data 
reduction software. I did a little bit of just

24:01.599 --> 24:03.301
about everything. And there were two other 
people. There was an infrared instrumentation

24:05.384 --> 24:10.049
person who got the title at the same time. Who was 
that?

24:13.533 --> 24:14.895
Joyce, Dick Joyce. He's still an infrared 
instrument person, but he was also a person who was

24:15.533 --> 24:30.015
plenty competent and knowledgeable in 
astronomy, but apparently was never going to make

24:15.533 --> 24:30.015
it in tenure track, and yet you just couldn't run. 
You couldn't run an observatory without him. You

24:32.238 --> 24:34.762
needed his people, so they acknowledged this. The 
third person, I think, was Ingemar Furinlid,

24:34.822 --> 24:39.870
who's now, I believe, in Georgia. I believe he was 
the third one at the time. I remember there were

24:42.914 --> 24:53.325
three of us, and he was an optical spectroscopy 
person, high-resolution spectroscopy person,

24:42.914 --> 24:53.325
so he was doing photography and spectrographs and 
that sort of thing. Once again, a specialist in

24:53.985 --> 24:57.208
instrument management. Now, big observatories 
like NOAO, Kitpeak NOAO, or NREO, are full of

24:57.328 --> 25:03.975
people with this title. And at NREO, the... In 
fact, NREO has now largely obliterated the

25:08.572 --> 25:13.099
distinctions in the job titles. They still have a 
notion of tenure, but my title is now associate

25:14.121 --> 25:25.359
scientist and it's logically equivalent to 
associate professor, but I'm not a tenured, not

25:14.121 --> 25:25.359
strictly speaking, tenured. When did you leave 
Kitt Peak and why? I left in 1981.

25:33.496 --> 25:37.062
Well, there was a lot of administrative 
turbulence at Kitt Peak in those years. And I was in

25:38.664 --> 25:51.505
a, well, people like me who are in a support role 
wind up getting assigned to technical divisions

25:38.664 --> 25:51.505
who do not necessarily have sympathy for the fact 
that we are also scientists. And as a scientist,

25:51.873 --> 25:57.864
I'm trained as an independent researcher, and I'm 
trained to be an independent thinker. And I'm just

25:58.165 --> 26:02.894
naturally a rather ornery and intellectually 
independent person. That's the nature of it. Only

26:04.096 --> 26:07.783
people like us ever get to the top and get a PhD. So 
there's a terrific selection effect there.

26:10.992 --> 26:31.414
necessarily a good person to be told what to do and 
then to

26:10.992 --> 26:31.414
be put into a technical division and put under 
technical management if that technical

26:10.992 --> 26:31.414
management isn't astute enough to realize what's 
going on you can get problems created so Anyway,

26:32.272 --> 26:40.523
there was turbulence in the computing division at 
that time, a lot of change of personnel, a lot of

26:32.272 --> 26:40.523
policy problems. There was generally a lot of 
turbulence at Kitt Peak in that era. Jeff Burbage

26:44.648 --> 26:45.890
was director. There was a lot of controversy 
around. And anyway, they appointed somebody over

26:47.492 --> 26:58.026
me who insulted me on the day he was appointed. so I 
decided I would leave. I'd about had enough. I'd

27:01.070 --> 27:17.138
been there nine years anyway, and I was getting a 
little tired of what I'd been doing, and prospects

27:01.070 --> 27:17.138
didn't look too good with a lot of controversy 
going on, so I called up one of my friends and 60 days

27:01.070 --> 27:17.138
later moved to NREO. So I've I've continued doing 
more or less the same thing, software systems. And

27:22.620 --> 27:31.176
I generally define myself as being interested in 
information handling in astronomy,

27:22.620 --> 27:31.176
observational astronomy research. So I'm 
interested in the support of observational

27:31.216 --> 27:35.805
astronomy research. And information for me is 
everything from photons in the sky to ink on a

27:36.446 --> 27:41.496
journal page. I originally was mostly interested 
in things like cosmology, but as the years have

27:41.476 --> 27:55.603
gone by, my view of the universe has broadened a 
lot, and I'm now totally panchromatic in my view.

27:55.955 --> 28:00.079
and my old disdain for things like planets is all 
gone now. And so I view all of astronomy as one big

28:00.299 --> 28:04.003
thing that's all valuable. All kinds of planetary 
astronomers spun. Planetary, stellar,

28:06.806 --> 28:10.790
extra-galactic astronomers, they all sponge off 
of you, right? Well, I guess. I'm just saying that I

28:12.291 --> 28:17.577
myself no longer have the prejudices I had as a 
young fellow. That's what I was going to ask you.

28:18.718 --> 28:22.722
Back when you were in grad school, did you 
notice... a sneering disdain on the part of real

28:22.702 --> 28:30.290
astronomers for Planetary One?

28:32.393 --> 28:34.295
Yeah. There's no question it existed. And I've 
effectively confessed to it, to being a part of it,

28:36.497 --> 28:46.068
although I certainly earned money off of 
planetary astronomy in those days. It's a fact

28:47.009 --> 28:47.730
that that the NASA money had to fund planetary 
astronomy and had to deliberately subsidize it on

28:48.352 --> 28:57.987
ground-based astronomy in particular as an 
adjunct to the space program. I'm sure that was

28:58.047 --> 28:59.469
necessary. And even today, I suppose a lot of the 
funding of planetary work is strictly NASA money,

28:59.509 --> 29:06.059
even now. 95%. Yeah. And what I've also said to you, 
though, is that I personally, I can't speak for

29:09.204 --> 29:16.215
anybody else, but I personally no longer have this 
prejudice. But that's something that came to me

29:19.271 --> 29:23.180
over the years. I was also strictly an optical 
person, and I thought only cosmology mattered.

29:29.105 --> 29:31.989
and I have a much broader view of science now. It's 
interesting that you would have that early view

29:32.009 --> 29:47.288
being at McDonald, being at the University of 
Texas at McDonald, which was one of the few places,

29:32.009 --> 29:47.288
actually the only place with a really large 
telescope or telescopes that were the major

29:32.009 --> 29:47.288
portion of the time to planetary observance. 
Sure. It is a little unusual. I could easily have

29:50.372 --> 29:52.214
gone into planetary work. When I was nearing my 
completion of my degree, I seriously considered

29:59.176 --> 30:01.658
going to JPL. In effect, I got an invitation to go to 
JPL. In fact, they really wanted me to go, not

30:06.783 --> 30:10.566
bother to finish my degree. They want you to work on 
radars or what? Well, the person who was making the

30:14.710 --> 30:26.601
effort was Reinhold Beer, who had brought his big 
Fourier transform spectrometer to the 107-inch,

30:27.239 --> 30:35.511
And I had been around, and we had talked a lot, and he 
had seen me, and so he essentially attempted to

30:27.239 --> 30:35.511
recruit a computing person for JPL. And I was well 
aware of what he was doing, and I was well aware that

30:36.172 --> 30:42.822
I'd be entering the space program, planetary 
work, and all that. And I did seriously consider

30:42.942 --> 30:44.685
it. I even traveled to JPL, thought about it a lot, 
but decided to finish my degree under de

30:44.765 --> 30:50.613
Vaucouleur. And I did. And so that was, once again, 
the fork in the road. One could have decided, and

30:55.825 --> 31:01.253
there was a case where the planetary money almost 
captured me. NASA money almost captured me. Do you

31:07.082 --> 31:15.635
find radio astronomers different to work with 
than optical astronomers?

31:15.655 --> 31:17.918
That's a good question, Ron. One can give several 
kinds of answers. Single-dish radio astronomers

31:24.021 --> 31:36.733
are psychologically pretty similar to optical 
astronomers, and they're somewhat ornery and

31:24.021 --> 31:36.733
competitive, and they have some problems in 
cooperating. whereas large-scale

31:37.405 --> 31:49.685
interferometric radio astronomy tends to be more 
of a community activity, and there is a tendency to

31:37.405 --> 31:49.685
be somewhat more cooperative, and that's 
especially true in VOBI. The VOBI guys are

31:49.785 --> 32:00.122
basically very easy to get along with, because if 
they're not, they got selected out of the field,

31:49.785 --> 32:00.122
since VOBI could only operate on a cooperative 
basis. I'm very aware of this. I just spent five

32:02.115 --> 32:04.758
years working with BLBI people. That's a very long 
baseline interferometry. Exactly. Which NASA is

32:09.584 --> 32:16.172
now putting a lot of money into with the Radio 
Astron VSOP program, which is coming out of JPL.

32:17.814 --> 32:22.780
And I'm very impressed with how they get along with 
each other. Whereas in optical astronomy,

32:22.820 --> 32:29.248
there's always been fierce rivalries between 
observatories And you can see it even in the big NSF

32:29.853 --> 32:34.578
projects. You can see it in the panel, the tenure 
panel cycles. You can see these kind of fierce

32:38.703 --> 32:40.846
rivalries. You can see it right now in the Jiminy 
project. The radio guys mostly have had a tendency

32:44.190 --> 32:57.565
to do their debates in private, get their act 
together, and present a united front, which is how

32:44.190 --> 32:57.565
they could build a VLA and a VLBA and other large 
projects like that. Another reason I'm

32:57.612 --> 33:03.980
mentioning that is I was originally going to be a 
radio astronomer, and eventually did do some

32:57.612 --> 33:03.980
radio astronomy. But because of my training in 
graduate school, I didn't have a prejudice

33:04.000 --> 33:12.911
against planetary astronomy. There never was a 
prejudice against planetary work in radio. and i

33:18.082 --> 33:44.022
wonder if it was because both fields were looked on 
as pariahs by possessors of large telescopes it

33:18.082 --> 33:44.022
may be something in what you say i i think it's also 
true well let me say i think it's also true that the

33:18.082 --> 33:44.022
radio guys are sort of mentally very flexible they 
were always dealing with strange stuff and so they

33:18.082 --> 33:44.022
were willing to entertain new thoughts new ideas 
and and somewhat exotic ideas, because they were

33:44.002 --> 33:55.479
always dealing with somewhat exotic things by 
traditional astronomy standards, whereas to do

33:44.002 --> 33:55.479
cosmology was a part of a kind of grand 
intellectual tradition. And Hubble and on and on

33:56.541 --> 34:02.089
like this. You were dealing with the grandest 
things. You had the feeling that Einstein was here

34:04.333 --> 34:08.499
and so on. This was the grandest scale of activity. 
Also, the prestige of the big California

34:12.807 --> 34:23.823
institutions had a lot to do with this, because 
they had stressed this kind of program,

34:12.807 --> 34:23.823
especially Hubble. The whole heritage of Hubble 
and his successors was a powerful intellectual

34:24.123 --> 34:34.258
standard that tended towards setting up the style 
for what was the best. I think in a way, while I agree

34:38.645 --> 34:48.265
with it all, it's also kind of distorted our view of 
the universe. And I have confessed to you that over

34:48.565 --> 34:52.489
the years I've changed and broadened my view. I no 
longer take cosmology quite as seriously as I used

34:52.529 --> 35:01.418
to, although it's still my ultimate basic 
interest in the universe. Did you ever get the

35:01.438 --> 35:14.151
feeling that you were considered second-rate 
because you got a degree from UT University of

35:01.438 --> 35:14.151
Texas instead of, say, Harvard or Michigan or 
Caltech?

35:16.392 --> 35:21.440
The year I entered Texas, the number of students 
doubled. The next year it doubled again. I entered

35:23.503 --> 35:25.265
in 64. Harlan had come to Texas in 63. This was an 
extraordinary growth rate in the department. It

35:34.439 --> 35:35.941
was change, change, change. It was instability. 
It was a department that had no reputation. It came

35:39.066 --> 35:42.531
out of nothing, very much in the Texas style. And 
so... I certainly was well aware that I was coming

35:46.582 --> 35:51.630
from an institution that didn't have name 
recognition. However, by the time I graduated

35:52.171 --> 35:59.281
eight years later, already the department had a 
recognition. For example, one of the graduates

35:59.402 --> 36:07.474
during that period in the class that I was in that 
entered in September of 64 was Beatrice Tinsley.

36:08.856 --> 36:13.483
And Beatrice Tinsley's reputation is as high as it 
comes. past tense of course she died so some years

36:14.290 --> 36:43.437
ago so she was she was in the same classes that i was 
in in the fall of 64 and immediately it was apparent

36:14.290 --> 36:43.437
her intellectual superiority but another person 
who was in the class was bob harrington who went to

36:14.290 --> 36:43.437
the naval observatory he also just died in january 
yes very very recently he was in the same class i was

36:14.290 --> 36:43.437
in also intellectually very high but that you know 
there were there were others who were in the

36:43.990 --> 36:46.173
program. So the program did manage to get good 
people. Most of them ultimately got employed. I

36:53.924 --> 37:01.956
must say the Texas program produced a lot of people 
who stayed in astronomy, who concentrated on

36:53.924 --> 37:01.956
getting the job done, and they are all over the 
world now. Everywhere I go today, I meet people who

37:02.036 --> 37:05.161
were in Texas. The field is full of astronomy 
grads. So in many ways, the degree has more value as

37:10.518 --> 37:14.843
every year passes because of that. Of course, 
another program that was like that was Arizona. In

37:17.886 --> 37:20.950
the same period of time, Arizona had tremendous 
growth. So both of those institutions came up out

37:21.030 --> 37:26.636
of nowhere and created new traditions that now are 
reputable. How much do you think that NASA money

37:27.617 --> 37:35.226
had to do with that in the case of the University of 
Texas? It built the 107-inch. It funded a number of

37:39.377 --> 37:44.103
other key people who came to Texas in that era. But 
even more than that, I think viewed in a large

37:44.984 --> 38:03.306
historic perspective, the whole business of the 
Sputnik scare, which led to a concentration on

37:44.984 --> 38:03.306
science education and science research

38:04.062 --> 38:13.336
there was a vast amount of money spent by the U.S. in 
the whole infrastructure of scientific

38:04.062 --> 38:13.336
research, and it wasn't just NASA money. It was NSF 
money and other money sources. So there was a whole

38:18.323 --> 38:24.933
concerted effort to build research and new 
research groups, new instrumentation of all

38:18.323 --> 38:24.933
kinds. NASA money was a huge part of that. 
Incidentally, I spent a summer working on the

38:28.118 --> 38:31.082
Apollo program. I'm very proud that I spent a 
summer in Houston. I did a tiny little part of it.

38:37.633 --> 38:39.516
I'm sure my stuff was irrelevant. I did a Monte 
Carlo study of the probability that a proton flare

38:39.596 --> 38:46.786
would roast the astronauts while they were in 
flight. So it was strictly a statistical

38:47.728 --> 38:50.372
calculation. That's what I did for a couple of 
months. But I was very proud to have had a small part

38:53.075 --> 38:56.460
of Apollo. Now, that's an example where NASA money 
It was employing a lot of people. I wasn't the only

39:03.031 --> 39:04.013
one. So there were a lot of us who were involved, and 
it was the whole stimulus of a vast NASA budget

39:04.775 --> 39:16.218
pouring into engineering and into scientific 
research. But it wasn't just NASA money, and that

39:16.238 --> 39:18.703
spirit degraded somewhat in the 70s. By the time I 
graduated, that money flux was out, and there were

39:21.837 --> 39:29.971
a number of my fellow students who had trouble 
finding positions in the 70s. I did not because I

39:30.431 --> 39:35.720
was a technology person, and technology was hot 
stuff in the 70s. So I didn't have a job problem, but

39:36.221 --> 39:40.949
some of my fellow grad students for a few years did. 
Let's see. Here's an off-the-wall question. When

39:46.390 --> 39:54.922
you meet people on airplanes or something who are 
not astronomers or scientists, and you tell them

39:46.390 --> 39:54.922
what you do, what's their reaction? Well, 
standard question number one is, have you heard

39:54.942 --> 40:00.269
from them lately, or some question like that. 
Well, I mean, do they think that astronomers are

40:01.290 --> 40:11.184
parasites, or do they think that we ought to be, 
that it's a good deal that we have some astronomers

40:01.290 --> 40:11.184
in this country, or what? Some people... some 
people simply don't see the point. And I actually

40:17.813 --> 40:30.511
have problems with one of my uncles who apparently 
has never really understood the justification

40:17.813 --> 40:30.511
for science in general, but certainly astronomy. 
Are we parasites? Yes, the answer is yes, of course

40:32.694 --> 40:34.436
we are. My standard statement is that for at least 
4,000 years there have been astronomers on

40:35.478 --> 40:41.786
government payrolls. And I feel That's 
personally how I feel about it, that I'm a part of a

40:43.885 --> 40:47.837
very long-term tradition. The intellectual and 
political leadership of the world, of almost

40:48.399 --> 40:54.216
every society in the world, historically, over at 
least 4,000 years, have all thought that some

40:54.753 --> 41:02.566
fraction of their money should go into supporting 
people like us. Isn't that, I mean, do you agree

41:03.567 --> 41:05.150
with me? Yes, yes. I mean, it's a fact. Good enough 
for Galileo, it's good enough for me. It's a

41:08.976 --> 41:10.519
historic fact, you know. So some Babylonian 
astronomer, he may have been doing what we call

41:10.579 --> 41:18.252
astrology today, but that was what passed for 
professional astronomy in that era. And

41:18.432 --> 41:21.537
intellectually, he was a person not unlike us. as 
much like us as he could be in the culture of 4,000

41:22.057 --> 41:26.603
years ago. I'll give you another example. I was 
speaking to Paul Hodge yesterday, who's an AJ

41:29.567 --> 41:45.448
editor in the department at University of 
Washington in Seattle, and he was remarking that

41:29.567 --> 41:45.448
he had found in his library copies of volume one of 
the of the A.J. in 1840-something,

41:46.843 --> 41:49.608
1850-something. And I was speaking about, but 
your department couldn't have started until

41:50.490 --> 41:59.525
somewhat later, 20 years later or something, or 
couldn't possibly have had this collection. So he

41:59.565 --> 42:01.949
started saying, well, yeah, it's true. Shortly 
after the state was formed, a committee of people

42:02.029 --> 42:12.246
had to get together to decide what they were going 
to do with their new society, their culture being

42:02.029 --> 42:12.246
created in the wilderness. And so they would 
create a university. What should this university

42:15.454 --> 42:17.056
teach? Well, let's see, it should teach 
literature and it should teach astronomy.

42:20.701 --> 42:21.422
Astronomy? Once again, here you see this historic 
fact that human beings recognize that up there

42:22.484 --> 42:37.845
above the sky, above the air, the atmosphere, is 
something that is of fundamental importance. and

42:38.348 --> 42:50.160
that human culture, society, has to take 
cognizance of it and that it's appropriate to pay

42:38.348 --> 42:50.160
some of us to spend our lives trying to sort it out 
and interpret it. So I think that was just one

42:51.642 --> 42:58.690
little story, but I think it fits into this grand 
tradition that we are a part of. Do you think

42:59.270 --> 43:01.593
planetary astronomy is a part of astronomy? I 
regard it as such.

43:08.032 --> 43:11.175
It's also a part of geophysics, geology. That's 
certainly true, and I'm sure the meteorological

43:12.136 --> 43:18.941
people would see affinities to their disciplines 
as well. So planetary sits in a crack between the

43:19.542 --> 43:24.546
earth sciences and the space sciences. Certainly 
the kind of plasma physics that goes on in the solar

43:25.607 --> 43:34.415
system has strong analogies and relationships to 
plasma physics elsewhere in the universe.

43:36.136 --> 43:37.077
Likewise, We still don't fully understand 
angular momentum questions in the formations of

43:37.512 --> 43:53.232
solar systems, the overall heavy metal flows, 
where the heavy metals go and where they come from.

43:53.292 --> 43:56.917
Planetary has relationships to all of those. I 
think if you take a large-scale view of what our

43:58.119 --> 44:06.169
science is all about, planetary science plays an 
integral role in it. However, there is a big

44:09.601 --> 44:15.748
distinction being a remote sensing science, 
which we are. I feel great affinity to remote

44:16.710 --> 44:24.499
sensing people like we're doing EOS and Earth 
observation systems because we're also a remote

44:16.710 --> 44:24.499
sensing science. The big distinction, though, is 
they actually get some of the time to get ground

44:24.980 --> 44:29.305
truth. to calibrate their remote sensing effort. 
Planetary sciences, because of the planetary

44:32.460 --> 44:37.186
missions, get ground truth also. But the kind of 
astronomy I've spent most of my life working on

44:38.268 --> 44:45.296
never gets ground truth. And that's a distinction 
that's pretty clear cut.

44:50.483 --> 44:55.950
Let me ask a question that has to do with planetary 
astronomy, but all kinds of astronomy. In the last

44:56.318 --> 45:02.486
couple of decades, we've seen a number of 
subdivisions of the American astronomical site.

45:02.526 --> 45:05.690
It used to just be one American astronomical site. 
Now you have historical and high energy and

45:05.750 --> 45:09.714
planetary and solar. And their own journals. Is 
that good or bad? Or

45:13.940 --> 45:17.985
just inevitable? I don't think it's necessarily 
surprising whether it's a bad thing or not. I have

45:25.360 --> 45:26.381
trouble deciding. You actually didn't mention 
another one that I'm aware of because of my

45:26.842 --> 45:34.090
employment in radio astronomy. Radio 
astronomers are more interested in going to an

45:34.530 --> 45:39.375
ERSE meeting. Although you'll see plenty of them 
giving papers here at the AAS meeting. They are

45:46.684 --> 45:54.372
here, but most astronomers, most non-radio 
astronomers, don't realize that the radio guys

45:46.684 --> 45:54.372
have their own their own environment that's 
independent of the AAS. And that's the URSI there,

45:58.522 --> 46:01.465
radio science. Radio scientific international. 
Yeah, right, right, right. Recently, a lot of

46:07.914 --> 46:22.572
people, both optical and radio astronomers, have 
been getting a lot of publicity and, I guess, money

46:07.914 --> 46:22.572
from topics such as the search for 
extraterrestrial intelligence, killer

46:07.914 --> 46:22.572
asteroids and comets, looking for other solar 
systems. Right. All in the ozone layer. Right. Are

46:24.845 --> 46:26.207
they overdoing that? You mean, are we as a society 
overdoing it by putting money into those efforts?

46:32.694 --> 46:36.298
No, are astronomers putting too much emphasis on 
that stuff? Or is it worth it? Well, that's the

46:38.641 --> 46:39.442
question. As a society, should we be putting money 
into those kinds of research? Is that your

46:43.686 --> 46:44.547
question? Yeah, and should astronomers be doing 
that? We're as good as anybody else with our remote

46:47.711 --> 46:51.515
sensing attitudes and our technology. We have the 
right technology. And we have the right

46:53.313 --> 46:54.674
attitudes. We're as good scientists to be doing it 
as anybody else. And it's not, in that sense,

46:57.397 --> 47:00.840
inappropriate.

47:04.103 --> 47:15.013
Now,

47:04.103 --> 47:15.013
personally, SETI is this fascinating subject 
where one isn't quite sure what probabilities to

47:04.103 --> 47:15.013
assign to it. Is it a waste of time is a really tough 
question because most Most of us who are trying to

47:20.903 --> 47:28.112
pick a research program to work on, we do a 
calculation of the odds we're going to succeed in

47:20.903 --> 47:28.112
finding something interesting.
