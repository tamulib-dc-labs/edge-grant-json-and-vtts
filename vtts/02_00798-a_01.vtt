00:01.128 --> 00:01.669
Testing. This is an interview with Dr. John H. 
Milleth.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.985
Today's date is February 25th, 1980.

00:18.767 --> 00:26.836
This is an interview with the veterinarian 
project and this is Terry Anderson. This is a test.

00:39.856 --> 00:44.543
This is an interview with Dr. John Milleth on 
February 25, 1980. This is Terry Anderson. Could

00:46.986 --> 00:48.508
you tell us where and when you were born? I was born 
in Batesville, Arkansas in 1903.

00:55.398 --> 00:58.182
Can you tell us about your parents, their 
occupation? Well,

00:58.242 --> 01:09.238
my father was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

01:09.809 --> 01:11.971
His father was from Ireland. Came over here at the 
time of the potato famine in Ireland. In the 1840s.

01:19.179 --> 01:19.799
1840s. And settled in Kentucky, married there, 
and had the, well, he was married twice. He had a

01:27.547 --> 01:37.858
larger family with the first marriage, and then 
with the second marriage, my father had only the

01:27.547 --> 01:37.858
one child. After my father was born, I don't 
believe that his father lived very much longer

01:38.699 --> 01:45.548
after that. But dad had to begin work at an early 
age. So he missed out on his schooling. He began as a

01:52.338 --> 01:56.704
water boy and just sort of worked his way up. He was 
with the US engineers on river work on Green River

01:56.744 --> 02:06.597
in Kentucky. Then in later years, he was down in 
Arkansas, where I was born, putting in a lock and

02:07.319 --> 02:15.132
dam on White River. Oh, really? Yeah. Is this part 
of the Bull Shoals? I don't know. I've never been

02:22.204 --> 02:23.426
back. So it wasn't too far from Batesville, 
because we lived in Batesville, and he went back

02:24.348 --> 02:31.360
and forth. In the Ozarks, yeah. Yeah. and from 
there he was transferred back to Kentucky to do

02:33.442 --> 02:50.183
some work on Green River and then from there to 
Texas to work on the Brazos River cleaning out

02:33.442 --> 02:50.183
overhanging timbers and blasting out log jams and 
what have you. This was down around San Philippi

02:50.203 --> 02:53.447
and Seeley. We lived in Seeley at the time, Seeley, 
Texas. And when that was completed we were

03:02.045 --> 03:05.368
transferred to Navasota, Texas. And he put in the 
Lock and Dam in the Brazos out from Navasota. He was

03:10.793 --> 03:13.876
the superintendent of construction by that time. 
But even though he had never been to school a day in

03:13.916 --> 03:23.726
his life, he learned from the engineers who were on 
the job. He studied their books and so on.

03:29.399 --> 03:32.243
His job actually was to handle men. And he knew how 
to handle men. So from Navasota, where I began

03:36.510 --> 03:48.228
school in 1910, we were transferred to Ferris, 
Texas. He had some repair work to do on the locking

03:48.288 --> 03:54.958
dam out from Ferris in the Trinity River. And from 
there down to Crockett. to put in a locking dam in

03:59.234 --> 04:03.498
the Trinity River at Hurricane Shoal. He was 
transferred after that to Port Arthur, Texas, to

04:04.859 --> 04:15.309
put in a locking dam there to keep the salt water off 
the rice farms. And this was about 1917. And my

04:20.714 --> 04:22.516
mother died that year. And he gave up this work with 
the US engineers. and began a farming life.

04:31.505 --> 04:31.806
Really? Yeah. He said he'd had enough moving 
around, and we had moved with him everywhere he

04:33.248 --> 04:38.314
went. Mother was tired of moving, too, and that's 
the reason we settled in Crockett. She said she

04:43.300 --> 04:45.263
wasn't going to move anymore. And he went to Port 
Arthur by himself and would come home at Christmas

04:46.204 --> 04:55.836
and so on, any other vacation time he had. She died 
that year, 1917. But tell me about her. She was an

05:00.956 --> 05:02.798
old Kentucky girl. Her name was Bobbitt, 
B-O-B-B-I-T-T,

05:05.060 --> 05:11.165
Rosella Bobbitt. I don't know much of her family. 
Of course, I was supposed to have seen them when we

05:16.971 --> 05:25.418
went from Arkansas back to Kentucky, but I was too 
young to remember anything about it. I've never

05:25.735 --> 05:31.422
kept up with her side of the family. I don't know, 
she had some sisters, she had some brothers and so

05:31.442 --> 05:37.929
on, but whatever became of them, I don't know. What 
did she die of? She had peritonitis. It was

05:41.934 --> 05:43.736
actually a miscarriage. Oh, that's stupid. And 
developed peritonitis from that. So,

05:49.343 --> 05:53.768
we went down on the farm with dad. They were four 
boys and one girl. And with my grandmother, that

06:02.198 --> 06:07.764
was my father's mother, she was with us. And so this 
was an extensive farming project down there. They

06:13.730 --> 06:16.212
had about 5,000 acres. He had bought a farm when we 
first moved to Crockett, which was... The farm was

06:21.288 --> 06:27.896
adjacent to the one that he bought half interest in 
in 1917. So he ran both the farms.

06:34.243 --> 06:42.432
I stayed with him until 1921, from 1917 to 1921. 
That year was a bad farming year. I had 100 acres in

06:50.077 --> 06:55.144
cotton on my own, and I think I picked about three 
bales. It rained every day. I raised beautiful

06:57.187 --> 07:01.733
crabgrass and all that. Anyhow, I said, Dad, I'm 
leaving. I wasn't going to school. The years that I

07:07.260 --> 07:15.552
was on the farm, we were too far away from a school to 
go, and I had dropped out there in Crockett. Well, I

07:16.873 --> 07:19.577
was supposed to have gone into the eighth grade, 
And I dropped out. So the people who owned the

07:22.869 --> 07:35.903
remainder of the ranch, Dave Nunn and his sister, 
Mrs. Curry, needed someone to help them. They had a

07:35.963 --> 07:49.277
big home in Crockett, an old southern home, and had 
15 cows that needed milking, a big yard, car, and

07:35.963 --> 07:49.277
house to clean, and so on. I went there and they paid 
me $10 a week and gave me my room and board and I

07:50.438 --> 08:05.715
helped to milk the 15 cows morning and night and did 
the yard work and everything else that needed to be

07:50.438 --> 08:05.715
done around the place. How old were you at that 
time? Well, this was in 1921. I was going on 18,

08:10.200 --> 08:16.868
yeah, when I went there.

08:18.670 --> 08:20.973
Can we talk for a minute about this rice farm? This 
is very interesting to me. In 1917, your father's

08:22.395 --> 08:24.858
rice farm? No. He was transferred to Port Arthur to 
put in a lock down there to keep the water off of the

08:26.260 --> 08:33.769
rice farm. Oh, okay. Then what kind of farm did he 
have? Well, we had sort of a combination farm. We

08:39.016 --> 08:45.825
had all cotton and corn, and we had cattle and hogs 
and goats and such as that. And did you say 5,000

08:47.020 --> 08:49.343
acres? Yeah, 5,000 acres in the Trinity River 
bottom in Houston County. Oh, it extended from Old

08:55.252 --> 09:10.494
Alabama Ferry, which is across from Centerville, 
and on down, oh, I don't know, several miles on down

08:55.252 --> 09:10.494
the river toward Old Claps Ferry. Now, did you 
have... you had with your with your brothers did

09:12.417 --> 09:38.104
you have could you take care of the work yourself on 
the farm or did you have to hire out labor we had i

09:12.417 --> 09:38.104
don't have any families we had on the place dad 
built houses to for them and they lived and shared

09:12.417 --> 09:38.104
crops and so on and whenever he needed them where 
they did they labor for him oh i see so when i They're

09:39.012 --> 09:40.914
both black and white. Both black and white. Yeah. I 
guess we had around 20 families on the place,

09:43.697 --> 09:51.105
something like that. But I went on school. Right. 
OK. Now, let's start that. Your education. Let's

09:56.711 --> 10:02.437
talk about your education in high school in 
Crockett, Texas. What subjects did you like?

10:06.241 --> 10:08.023
Well, I liked mathematics. I

10:08.763 --> 10:26.009
liked mathematics, and I thought when I graduated 
in 1924, when I graduated from high school, I

10:08.763 --> 10:26.009
thought, well, electrical engineering was what I 
wanted. Oh, I see. So I came to A&M and signed up for

10:27.411 --> 10:31.497
double E. Oh, you did? Oh, yeah. Okay, that was 
another. So that was when Dr. Bolton was head of the

10:36.944 --> 10:39.428
department.

10:42.052 --> 10:43.334
I stayed with it a year. My background in high 
school was rather poor. I thought I had had no

10:48.421 --> 10:51.225
chemistry. I had good math courses, but no 
chemistry. And that was one of my big weaknesses at

10:55.131 --> 10:58.076
A&M. I had an awful time in chemistry. Because in 
those days, in the chemistry department, you were

11:01.441 --> 11:05.787
begun with students like my roommate, who had been 
to prep school. And he had had chemistry. And to

11:13.576 --> 11:17.081
him, it was just sort of a laughing matter. To me, 
the first examination at the end of the first week,

11:17.882 --> 11:24.071
we had the lab quiz. Give the chemical formula for 
the reagents on your desk. I didn't know what H2O

11:30.120 --> 11:31.842
was. This NH4OH and HCl and H2SO4 didn't mean 
anything to me. And so that's the way it was from

11:38.264 --> 11:40.988
then on. And valence was something else. Dr. 
Brayton tried to straighten me out on valence. You

11:49.082 --> 11:57.255
can imagine a couple dancing, and now they have two 
arms, and now they have three, and now they have

11:49.082 --> 11:57.255
four. taking me a little fast. Yeah, right. I 
stayed with it until almost the end of the

12:01.511 --> 12:07.801
semester, just to get as much out of it as I could. 
And two of the upperclassmen had already told me

12:08.743 --> 12:15.193
that no one expects to pass chemistry the first 
time they take it. And so, of course, I didn't

12:15.894 --> 12:19.259
believe them. But anyway, the second semester, I I 
didn't have chemistry. I took a course in plane

12:25.581 --> 12:29.845
surveying in place of it. And at the end of that 
first year, I changed over to biology.

12:37.013 --> 12:39.175
I left. Why did you think you changed? Mathematics 
was something that I didn't like at A&M. But you

12:44.621 --> 12:45.842
liked it in high school. I loved it because I had a 
lovely teacher. She was an older person. She was in

12:50.427 --> 12:53.871
her 60s and an old maid. And she knew how to teach 
mathematics. And I had plenty of time to study

12:57.777 --> 13:03.965
after I got through milking.

13:05.387 --> 13:17.182
But I did all right in mathematics until I got into 
analytical geometry. And they lost me on a

13:17.202 --> 13:19.986
parabola somewhere. I don't know. But there was an 
old boy teaching that course who was a graduate of

13:21.610 --> 13:28.578
University of Texas.

13:31.442 --> 13:46.920
I don't know whether he had any love for the Aggies 
or not, but anyway, he was one of these dry, sour

13:31.442 --> 13:46.920
pussies, and whatever answer you gave just didn't 
satisfy him at all. So I left it with him. There were

13:51.260 --> 13:53.223
some things I liked. I liked descriptive geometry 
and some other things, too. But my biology, I

13:58.832 --> 14:04.842
thought, that's where I should be. The English 
courses, I had no trouble with. I guess at A&M, I

14:09.128 --> 14:18.904
made good grades in English all the way through and 
was selected as a member of the Junto The

14:19.508 --> 14:36.433
J-U-N-T-O's, this was a select group of English 
students selected by Dr. or Mr. Thomas, Old Spot

14:19.508 --> 14:36.433
Thomas, we called him, and Tommy Mayo, who was 
librarian in the English department, an Oxford

14:19.508 --> 14:36.433
graduate. Oh, really? And they invited this 
select group of English students into their

14:36.974 --> 14:43.844
different homes in the English department. So I 
enjoyed it very much. But English to me has never

14:46.660 --> 15:00.039
been a bugaboo that it is to most A&M students and 
most students in general because of their poor

14:46.660 --> 15:00.039
background. I often, I don't know how many times 
I've talked to Tommy Mayo. Tommy, why do we have all

15:04.366 --> 15:15.722
of this literature, all this reading and so on in 
English at A&M and in other colleges as well? You

15:16.293 --> 15:19.538
start off with composition and rhetoric and so on. 
Why don't we begin with just plain old English

15:20.480 --> 15:24.026
grammar? The only English grammar I had was in the 
seventh grade. And at that age, it didn't mean

15:30.376 --> 15:34.262
anything to me. What's a compound sentence or 
complex or compound complex or simple sentence?

15:40.593 --> 15:42.115
And usually at A&M, The only time a student knows 
that he has a sentence, he finds a period. And

15:48.643 --> 15:49.525
that's about it. I was, just as an aside, I visited 
most of the courses in modern language. Oh, you

16:02.087 --> 16:02.728
did? When was this? Oh, this was during my years as a 
teacher. I had French and German and Russian, four

16:08.892 --> 16:12.857
years and so on. Well, I was in German, in one German 
class, and the professor, Mr. Stadelman, he was

16:13.417 --> 16:22.228
from Hitler, Germany. He left there to get away 
from Hitler. So he was here teaching German. He

16:27.995 --> 16:31.299
asked one of the students, what is a gerund? And 
this English student didn't know.

16:37.917 --> 16:42.185
Since I was a visitor, I wasn't supposed to enter 
into the conversation anyway. I just sat and

16:42.205 --> 16:45.310
listened. The only person in the class who knew 
what a gerund was was a Chinaman, a Chinese

16:45.330 --> 16:53.565
student. Really? Told him what a gerund is. 
Probably because he learned English overseas. He

17:00.297 --> 17:00.978
learned his English. He learned grammar. Well, 
that's been the case in A&M. And I think you can say

17:05.318 --> 17:09.604
it's that way in all universities. They need a good 
course in grammar, English grammar. But if they

17:15.853 --> 17:23.224
ever got it in high school or grammar school, 
probably they've forgotten it. And

17:24.125 --> 17:31.195
consequently, most college students are poor 
writers, poor spellers. Yeah, I know that from

17:31.411 --> 17:36.555
correcting my essay exams. Very poor. Okay, so can 
you tell me, can you describe the Corps back when

17:39.118 --> 17:49.486
you were in the Corps in the mid-1920s at A&M? Yeah, 
I can describe it very tersely. That's all right.

17:58.314 --> 18:00.996
The first thing they told me is fish. You're here at 
A&M now.

18:07.412 --> 18:07.993
Yes, sir.

18:13.040 --> 18:18.628
You give your ass to the upperclassmen and your 
heart to God. That's what they told you? And that's

18:21.752 --> 18:23.294
about the way it was. Really?

18:27.420 --> 18:30.904
Well, I don't care. You have to. They'll hear you on 
tape. That'll have to be deleted. But anyway...

18:38.871 --> 18:41.115
No, but that was the idea. That was the idea. I was 
about five years older than the average run of

18:43.879 --> 18:47.545
students. I was going on 21 when I graduated from 
high school. Yeah. So... That sort of thing didn't

18:54.149 --> 19:00.300
set too well with me, all this hazing business, and 
they did haze. And could you tell me about the

19:00.380 --> 19:02.163
hazing? What types? Anything. Everything went. 
For example? Well, anything they wanted to beat

19:08.654 --> 19:13.883
your rear end with, they beat it with. The Polo, 
Mallet, and what? And they didn't pull any

19:16.167 --> 19:17.710
punches. Sam Brown belts and wire hangers pulled 
out, coat hangers pulled out, split baseball

19:19.040 --> 19:28.232
bats, anything that they had. And Dr. Bazell was 
president then, and he had just come here from the

19:29.694 --> 19:45.334
old CIA, and all the upperclassmen claiming he was 
trying to put lace on their drawers because he was

19:29.694 --> 19:45.334
trying to do away with hazing.

19:46.580 --> 19:50.565
You were at the beck and call of the upperclassmen 
24 hours a day. I don't care if it was in the middle of

19:51.466 --> 19:56.293
the night and they wanted service, they got it. 2 
o'clock in the morning, go over to the ice plane,

19:58.275 --> 20:02.862
get a chunk of ice, I want some ice water. Or I'll be 
in at 4 o'clock on the morning train, you meet me

20:03.943 --> 20:09.050
there and pick up my suitcase. Really? Oh, 
everything went. And... Your rear end was black,

20:14.103 --> 20:18.049
and blue, and green, and yellow, and everything. 
And finally, it got to be as hard as that wall, and

20:18.610 --> 20:28.026
rigid, and just ridges on it from whatever they 
beat you with. Or an architect's triangular

20:28.046 --> 20:32.934
scale, you know what they are? Yeah, yeah. Right 
here. Oh, yeah, they hurt. And you put your leg

20:37.140 --> 20:40.566
across his, and he just starts, and you count. And 
somewhere up there toward 100, while he loses, you

20:42.250 --> 20:47.196
lose count, so he said. And he has to start all over 
again. What was the rationale behind this

20:50.761 --> 20:53.184
punishment? I often wondered. Yeah. I couldn't 
see anything. Now, if I had misbehaved, if I were

20:59.933 --> 21:09.065
undisciplined and so on, I could see where 
somebody needed to give me some licks. But just for

21:09.906 --> 21:10.907
it general purpose, no way. But by the time they got 
through that architect's gale, there'd be a place

21:16.581 --> 21:26.356
about the size of your hand, and it would be raised 
up about as thick as your hand and be black. And when

21:27.237 --> 21:30.062
you walked, it felt as if it would fall out. That 
would take you several weeks to get over that. Or

21:33.767 --> 21:38.194
they'd take a straight pen. and find a place that 
was not sensitive. Really? And just start

21:43.287 --> 21:47.493
pounding on that straight pin and driving on in. No 
kidding. Yeah. I've had that done to my leg.

21:55.204 --> 21:59.169
Oh, all manner of things that they did in those 
days. Heaven help us. But I guess that was the way of

22:00.912 --> 22:07.641
getting the Aggie spirit in you. But... Dr. 
Bazell, of course, clamped down on the hazing.

22:13.464 --> 22:21.331
Well, it got to where you weren't supposed to hit a 
student with any kind of a board. But nothing was

22:21.351 --> 22:24.754
said about exercise. Nothing was said about 
exercise. So you could do leaning rest. And you

22:32.060 --> 22:34.642
could sit on infinity. You know what sitting on 
infinity is? Sitting on a board? No. Sitting on

22:40.560 --> 22:41.422
that? The bayonet. The bayonet, and you squat 
until you're seated on the point of that bayonet.

22:49.272 --> 22:54.439
And then they take it out from under you, and you 
have to maintain that stance. I mean, maintain it

22:54.459 --> 22:57.282
until you fall. And by that time, sweat is running 
out of every pore on your body. Or you stand, and you

23:03.571 --> 23:06.855
do this way. Well, that goes all right for five or 10 
minutes. But you just keep on until you can't. And

23:18.192 --> 23:20.714
you can't even hold your arms out. And you're just 
perspiring. You're wringing wet. Try that.

23:30.864 --> 23:34.648
And fish calls, duty calls, and we had My roommate 
and I, old Stacy Siler, that old big fat boy, and I

23:35.219 --> 23:39.765
had two rooms to clean up. The major's room next 
door and then an upperclassman's room around on

23:41.247 --> 23:45.813
the other side. This was in old Milner Hall, second 
floor. So

23:51.581 --> 23:56.547
all kinds of duties. But I didn't mind that, 
cleaning up somebody's room along with your own.

24:03.687 --> 24:07.513
because, golly, I had been cleaning house for four 
years through high school. That was one of my jobs

24:08.074 --> 24:11.459
at the place where I was working. Clean house and 
cook and wash dishes and anything else. Make the

24:16.807 --> 24:19.130
fires in the morning, big old house. They had four 
fireplaces and, golly, I don't have any cords of

24:19.170 --> 24:27.323
wood that would burn in the wintertime anyway. 
Cleaning rooms didn't bother me and the people The

24:32.206 --> 24:34.750
fellas in those rooms were very nice. I did. One of 
the fellas by the name of Gatlin is retired and at

24:36.993 --> 24:42.322
College Station now. But Plebe Miller, the other 
one who was rooming with Gatlin,

24:42.983 --> 24:54.280
was expelled or, well, I guess he was suspended. 
That freshman year, talking about hazing, In

24:59.527 --> 25:15.185
order to get the freshmen in troop B cavalry on the 
line and get them ready to go over to Austin, Texas

24:59.527 --> 25:15.185
for Thanksgiving and play the University of Texas 
in the new stadium, this was to be the first game. We

25:15.906 --> 25:21.673
were going to initiate that field over there, 
dedicate the stadium. So they had to get us on the

25:21.693 --> 25:23.535
line. They took us on what they call a pecan hunt. 
Way out in here somewhere, this was all backwoods

25:27.674 --> 25:35.425
then, and they beat on us all Sunday afternoon. I 
mean, anything they had. Well, old Plebe was

25:38.229 --> 25:51.228
there, this Plebe Miller, was there, had a little 
piece of window sash rope, a little cotton rope,

25:38.229 --> 25:51.228
and he just tapped you a little bit, you know, you 
didn't feel it. But anyway, 25 of our

25:51.969 --> 25:56.095
upperclassmen were suspended. They were caught. 
One of the fellas, the freshman, claimed he had an

25:58.431 --> 26:04.657
injury to his tailbone. And so he went home. And his 
father was in the state legislature. And they had

26:10.083 --> 26:11.925
an investigation. Big deal. So 25 of the 
upperclassmen in B Troop were suspended or

26:13.547 --> 26:18.553
expelled. I don't know which. Anyway, Plebe was in 
the group. But Plebe had been to Annapolis. And in

26:26.399 --> 26:30.785
his sophomore year, he was expelled from 
Annapolis for hazing. That's the reason they

26:30.805 --> 26:32.427
called him Plebe.

26:35.652 --> 26:36.553
So he went home. His family disowned him. His gal, 
his girlfriend, quit him and all. And he came back

26:41.540 --> 26:45.946
to A&M about the next week. I awakened one morning, 
and Plebe was in my bunk with me, which was very

26:46.707 --> 26:55.039
unusual for an upperclassman to be bunking up with 
a a freshman, a fish, and in those little narrow

26:55.458 --> 26:59.362
bunks. Well, he stayed around about a week and went 
to Dallas and got him a room in a hotel and blew his

26:59.382 --> 27:07.051
brains out. No kidding. Yeah. Killed himself on 
that. Well, of course, we weren't very well

27:13.078 --> 27:19.125
pleased with the way it was handled. The freshman, 
in spite of all of the hazing and indecencies and

27:23.167 --> 27:29.094
what have you that upperclassmen did. You would 
give your right arm for an upperclassman. That was

27:35.562 --> 27:42.049
the bond between you, because even though they did 
haze you, they would do anything for you. But you

27:43.651 --> 27:46.254
got discipline. And I mean plenty of it.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.954
Did you haze when you became an upperclassman? No. 
You didn't haze? No. I was against it. But I didn't

28:02.843 --> 28:06.788
quit.

28:06.808 --> 28:07.349
I took it. Right along with the others. No, I have a 
picture I want to show you. It's just a negative,

28:13.417 --> 28:16.021
but this is my roommate. I want to show you about 
Hayden. You just sit there. I'll bring it to you. I

28:21.858 --> 28:41.670
had a print of this one, but I think you can tell from 
this negative, this was a black and white, you can

28:21.858 --> 28:41.670
tell the condition of his rear end. Oh, my 
goodness. He's had some boards go across that, it

28:43.894 --> 28:48.321
looks like. Many of them. Many of them.

28:52.823 --> 28:56.428
This was old Stacy, who later became an MD and a 
surgeon. That was his rear end. Mine looked just

28:59.012 --> 29:04.761
like it at that

28:59.012 --> 29:04.761
time. Really something. You're going to have to 
put in a positive.

29:12.833 --> 29:16.198
I didn't realize it was that .

29:32.345 --> 29:34.525
I wouldn't get somebody to be upset.

30:06.449 --> 30:23.494
These

30:06.449 --> 30:23.494
old boys here, both of these fellas, this was a 
fella by the name of Durst. He was from Crockett.

30:26.358 --> 30:30.223
Preacher, he was one of the Yale leaders in those 
days. He was suspended along with that group. And

30:33.809 --> 30:36.152
Buzz Gales was his roommate. They were both 
suspended. This old boy Durst became one of the

30:38.283 --> 30:42.094
vice presidents of Brown and Root. No kidding. He 
left two president scholars for A&M when he died.

30:48.451 --> 30:52.436
That's the love that they had for A&M, even though 
they were treated that way. Well, how can you

30:54.258 --> 30:55.500
account for that? That's really interesting. How 
can you account for the fact that these people were

30:56.841 --> 31:11.199
suspended and for the fact that you were hazed in 
sometimes a brutal fashion, and yet the respect

30:56.841 --> 31:11.199
and love for the institution is so profound? 
That's right. I would think that some people might

31:12.160 --> 31:15.206
be turned off by this. Well, they were. Some were 
turned off and they left. I see. Or either if they

31:23.562 --> 31:25.386
were misfits. I remember one boy who was a misfit. 
We packed him up and...
