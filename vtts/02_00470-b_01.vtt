00:01.145 --> 00:04.970
Today is July 30, 1980. This is Terry Anderson. 
We're talking to General Joe Hanover about his

00:07.813 --> 00:10.657
military career. This is our second interview. 
15th of February, 1941, you went active duty.

00:18.367 --> 00:19.048
That's right. Could you tell us about that? You 
were assigned to the 54th Coastal Artillery.

00:24.054 --> 00:25.376
Could you tell us about that duty? Yeah. I'll 
precede that just a little bit. A month or six weeks

00:30.257 --> 00:37.586
before February 15, I got this alert letter. And it 
said that I was being considered for recall for

00:39.087 --> 00:43.933
called active duty. And that's the question that I 
have any civilian pursuits that would prevent my

00:45.175 --> 00:55.427
being recalled or, or was available for a year's 
duty. I had no civilian pursuits that were

00:58.013 --> 01:06.063
considered as

00:58.013 --> 01:06.063
exempt from military duty. So I answered in the 
affirmative and very shortly thereafter I got a

01:06.924 --> 01:23.846
copy of a letter ordering me to active duty at Camp 
Wallace, Hitchcock, Texas with the 54th Coastal

01:06.924 --> 01:23.846
Artillery and had Perences colored. That sounds 
very strange today because it was an all-Negro

01:27.781 --> 01:32.586
organization with white officers. It was just 
being formed. It was picked up the name of an old

01:35.489 --> 01:43.837
World War I artillery unit, so it was a revived 
number. There were a great many cadremen who had

01:45.379 --> 01:56.050
had several years of Army duty who were made the 
non-commissioned officers in the Corps of the of

01:56.840 --> 02:09.680
the organization, enlisted men or raw recruits 
who had just maybe had their basic or very limited

01:56.840 --> 02:09.680
amount of training. Were they all Texans? No. No, 
they were from everywhere, all over. We initially

02:16.151 --> 02:18.915
set up The organization had headquarters in the 
basement of the Galvez Hotel in Galveston, Texas.

02:26.428 --> 02:29.272
Camp Wallace was not completed at that time. It was 
out some, oh, 15, 18 miles from Galveston. But as

02:34.460 --> 02:46.978
many people remember, prior to World War II, the 
Department of the Army went into quite a building

02:34.460 --> 02:46.978
program of camps and cantonments for this 
organization. buildup of military forces. So

02:49.855 --> 02:51.978
Camp Wallace was under construction.

02:54.421 --> 02:56.684
The headquarters was in the Galvez. And once we got 
in and got settled, we started a

02:56.764 --> 03:16.948
orientation and somewhat of a program of

02:56.764 --> 03:16.948
instruction for officers out at Port Crockett, 
which was on the south end of Galveston Island.

03:17.823 --> 03:24.692
That was an old established Coastal Artillery 
emplacement. We had a few regular Army officers,

03:24.772 --> 03:38.349
one or two West Pointers, and of course our 
commanding officer and several of the officers

03:24.772 --> 03:38.349
who had former, I mean who were on active duty at the 
time. So we spent the first month or six weeks in

03:38.369 --> 03:44.657
study and schooling learning how to be officers on 
active duty and this sort of thing. Why do you think

03:50.977 --> 03:58.125
that they picked you to be an officer in a black 
unit? Well, I think as it turned out, whatever

03:58.145 --> 04:10.881
motivated them to do it or whatever guidelines 
they used apparently were sound. Most of the

04:11.840 --> 04:15.183
officers were from this part of the country. From 
Texas or from the South? Well, most of them were

04:18.266 --> 04:20.729
from Texas. Most of them were from, I'd say the vast 
majority were from the South, but most of the vast

04:21.630 --> 04:29.618
majority were from Texas. And a great many of them, 
in fact about 60%, were recently graduated Aggies

04:29.638 --> 04:39.788
or Aggies who had graduated some years before. I 
think it was because they knew we understood those

04:40.730 --> 04:46.056
people a little better. We associated with them, 
and I think it turned out to be a fact. We had good

04:51.882 --> 04:54.985
rapport with them. We understood them and knew 
what their limitations and capabilities were,

04:55.025 --> 05:02.292
and we used them in those areas. And as the record of 
all black units went, I think we had a pretty good

05:03.333 --> 05:08.779
one. Was there any times, do you remember any 
incidents when there were any, what we'd call

05:09.265 --> 05:17.617
today race relation problems? We had really no 
problem much until we got up to North Carolina. We

05:23.666 --> 05:35.543
stayed in Fort, in Camp Wallace from, oh, sometime 
in March to June, and then we were transferred to

05:23.666 --> 05:35.543
Camp Davis, North Carolina. Now, even though that 
was a southern state, as far as integration, or

05:36.687 --> 05:52.985
there was no integration at that time, but as far as 
the geographical division of the country goes,

05:36.687 --> 05:52.985
North Carolina was a southern state. And there 
were 10,000 colored troops in Camp Davis. And the

05:59.792 --> 06:01.875
nearest town was Wilmington. And Wilmington only 
had about 10,000 people. and really the only place

06:06.758 --> 06:11.505
for recreation was Wilmington, and that posed a 
problem. The police of Wilmington had

06:12.987 --> 06:29.370
considerable problems with, well they'd have had 
problems with that many soldiers of any kind, but

06:12.987 --> 06:29.370
there were just no facilities for that number of 
black people in a town of 10,000 people. So there

06:29.390 --> 06:31.253
were a good many problems. Can you describe some of 
these problems? Well they were, you know, Lots of

06:36.526 --> 06:48.557
drunken disorderly and lots of objection on the 
part of the local citizens from the standpoint of

06:36.526 --> 06:48.557
coming into the businesses. At that time, they 
didn't want them in the restaurants. They didn't

06:51.659 --> 06:53.081
want them in the motel. Didn't have them. And they 
resented it, being soldiers of the United States,

06:56.143 --> 07:02.509
and rightfully so, probably. So that type of 
thing. gave the police a great deal of problems. We

07:09.773 --> 07:32.997
had a standing procedure where the officers on 
duty would have to go into Wilmington and ride and

07:09.773 --> 07:32.997
assist the police in reconnaissance and just 
general overseeing of the situation and helping

07:09.773 --> 07:32.997
with crowd control and this sort of thing. So there 
were problems but not really to the extent that

07:34.222 --> 08:02.423
we've had some some so-called riots in the last few 
years right right right how how many what were your

07:34.222 --> 08:02.423
responsibilities and how many men did you have 
under your command well i was in a company yeah when

07:34.222 --> 08:02.423
i went there as a as a company officer there were as i 
remember some 150 soldiers in the company My

08:02.926 --> 08:05.730
responsibility at that time was communications. 
If we went out on the bivouac, we set up the

08:06.971 --> 08:24.775
communications, the telephones, the 
communications to the gun emplacements,

08:06.971 --> 08:24.775
communications to battalion headquarters, that 
sort of thing, and also communication training. I

08:25.656 --> 08:30.182
was also the company supply officer, which 
handled all the supplies that came in. Each

08:30.402 --> 08:32.325
officer had several duties. But very shortly 
thereafter, I was assigned as assistant

08:32.997 --> 08:51.794
regimental motor officer, which meant that I was 
responsible for the maintenance and upkeep,

08:32.997 --> 08:51.794
third and fourth echelon maintenance of all 
vehicles in the whole regiment. So it was a

08:51.814 --> 08:54.600
regimental assignment from then on. Why did they 
give that to you? Did they think, well, you were an

08:56.824 --> 09:01.150
engineer, and therefore you might know something 
about motors? Oh, probably. Probably. And they

09:03.613 --> 09:11.983
asked me, you know, if my background would lend 
itself. Or, you know, a lot of times before they

09:12.003 --> 09:23.558
signed somebody back then, they'd ask you, you 
know, how you thought you could fit in there, or

09:12.003 --> 09:23.558
whether you didn't want to sign anybody that was 
absolutely opposed, even though You didn't have

09:24.061 --> 09:27.064
the fatal say. A fellow fits a whole lot better if 
he's agreeable. Absolutely. So I was somewhat

09:31.590 --> 09:35.414
maintenance inclined. So I was happy to get the 
job. Do you remember what your thoughts were when

09:38.638 --> 09:48.769
you were assigned to Camp Wallace and you realized 
that you were going to be an officer with a black

09:38.638 --> 09:48.769
unit? Do you remember what you thought? Thank you, 
ma'am. I had lived and worked and been around them

09:52.512 --> 09:56.878
all my life. And I really had no second thoughts 
about signing with a black outfit. I always felt

10:09.277 --> 10:12.381
like that I had good rapport with them. I had over 
the years. Now there were a lot of A lot of officers

10:15.968 --> 10:20.794
assigned to them were absolutely opposed to it. 
They fought it to, you know, and many of them got

10:20.854 --> 10:25.481
transferred. Oh, really? Yes. And it's probably 
better because if they were, if they were, they had

10:27.203 --> 10:44.085
their mind made up that they didn't want to serve 
like that, they would have never made good

10:27.203 --> 10:44.085
officers in that outfit because we had to do a great 
deal of the work of noncommissioned officers.

10:44.555 --> 10:51.283
because the educational level, the level of 
comprehension of those people was way low. And we

10:52.585 --> 11:03.619
just had to do a lot of work that a non-commissioned 
officer of more education and more know-how would

10:52.585 --> 11:03.619
be able to do. That's right. Now, when you were down 
in Camp Wallace, you said in North Carolina there

11:06.162 --> 11:12.450
were some problems. Were there any problems in 
Texas? Well, really, we were just receiving these

11:14.457 --> 11:17.700
troops. Oh, I see. We never did get our full 
complement until we got to North Carolina.

11:26.750 --> 11:34.377
By the time we got ready to move to North Carolina, 
we probably had, I would guess, 2,000 in the

11:26.750 --> 11:34.377
organization. But there were some of the same 
problems in and around Galveston and Hitchcock

11:35.298 --> 11:41.865
and Texas City. There was Houston that was a short 
ways away that they could share on weekends. And

11:48.422 --> 11:54.028
Houston could accommodate a great many more 
people than other smaller places. And then the

11:54.048 --> 12:02.237
concentration of soldiers around that area was 
not 10,000 on 10,000 population. So it was a

12:02.257 --> 12:09.105
completely different situation.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.447
What about white officers? and other white 
outfits. Were there any problems between a black

12:16.110 --> 12:24.122
outfit and white outfits, or did they ever work 
together at any time? I mean, did they ever have

12:24.142 --> 12:27.488
exercises? Well, I'm sure they did. We did not. We 
had missions on the seacoast, and we did not work

12:31.214 --> 12:40.388
really side by side with any other white 
organizations. Now we were always in the same,

12:40.874 --> 13:01.557
many times we were in the same camps with them, or 
forts or whatever, and there was some animosity a

12:40.874 --> 13:01.557
lot of times in that respect, but we were not really 
associated with too many other organizations,

12:40.874 --> 13:01.557
black or white. You went out to California, and was 
this with the same outfit then? That's right. And

13:07.324 --> 13:09.126
how were the Californians? toward the black 
soldiers? Oh, there was an entirely different

13:12.315 --> 13:17.960
situation than there was in Texas. They were not 
really segregated out there. They could go in

13:24.246 --> 13:31.873
establishments that could not go in back here, and 
it really made some difference. In what way? Well,

13:33.535 --> 13:37.999
I guess the soldiers themselves felt a little bit 
more wanted and a little bit more at home where they

13:38.958 --> 13:44.706
were more recognized. It's just a difference. Now 
for 20 years we've had the rise of a black power

13:49.893 --> 14:03.852
movement in the society and I was wondering if you 
sensed any unrest among the blacks that you worked

13:49.893 --> 14:03.852
with during the year? Not really. It was too early 
probably. That's right. And they had a very

14:10.312 --> 14:21.606
commendable sense of duty to country, at least the 
vast majority of them did. They were fulfilling a

14:21.626 --> 14:25.270
job for the defense of their country. And I doubt 
that we had any more that were what you'd call

14:25.391 --> 14:37.786
unfaithful

14:25.391 --> 14:37.786
than they had in white outfits. Really? That's 
right. Listen, I found years ago that when a black

14:40.366 --> 14:58.664
man learns a skill or he learns something that he 
can be used and be proud of, he is proud, with

14:40.366 --> 14:58.664
exception, of course. One good example, one of my 
responsibilities later on was

14:58.684 --> 15:09.715
teaching survey crews. as I indicated, surveying 
in baselines and whatnot. For the highway? No, for

15:15.558 --> 15:18.101
the Coast Artillery guns. I see. For the 
measurements and whatnot. We had to have survey

15:21.705 --> 15:33.358
crews, and I'd teach these boys enough surveying 
to where they could run an instrument or figure a

15:21.705 --> 15:33.358
few angles and figure little calculations. We 
even did a very intricate thing of what is termed in

15:33.418 --> 15:40.005
surveying is shooting Polaris. In other words, to 
orient a position, you set up and orient true north

15:41.979 --> 15:50.727
by looking at the North Star. And of course, it 
revolves in an elliptical circle. But you set up at

15:56.432 --> 16:07.362
night, and you set your instrument on the North 
Star, and you calculate these deviations, and

15:56.432 --> 16:07.362
then you establish a true north-south line. And we 
taught them, and we did this. And that was the

16:10.782 --> 16:18.922
proudest survey crew you ever did see, to know that 
they had, as they called it, shootin' Polaris. The

16:19.804 --> 16:27.002
point is, when they learned a skill or learned a 
trade, they were proud of it. But they were good

16:28.585 --> 16:31.090
soldiers. We had exceptionally good ones. You 
mentioned their duty, their feeling of duty. I've

16:39.748 --> 16:49.868
read a number of times the autobiography of 
Malcolm X and other radical blacks who, during the

16:39.748 --> 16:49.868
Second World War, they thought that other blacks 
who went into the war were fools because they were

16:49.848 --> 16:57.698
fighting against tyranny overseas when there was 
tyranny or segregation at home. But you never saw

16:57.718 --> 17:00.021
any of that. You never got any of that while you were 
in charge, while you were in the Army. Of course, we

17:04.327 --> 17:08.953
didn't take the black boys overseas. I was only 
with them in the States. There were a number of them

17:11.937 --> 17:15.302
that went overseas, of course. But I did not go 
overseas with them. But I would say I did not see

17:19.463 --> 17:26.835
that at all in this organization.

17:27.736 --> 17:31.762
They were very commendable soldiers. Now, I have 
one last question about this topic, and that is I

17:31.782 --> 17:46.626
know that you grew up with sharecroppers, but did 
commanding or being in command of a crew of black

17:31.782 --> 17:46.626
soldiers during the war, did that change your 
thoughts about black Americans in any way? No. You

17:49.045 --> 18:04.839
know, a strange thing about it, we had them, we had 
them four years, and about the end of that time,

17:49.045 --> 18:04.839
they began to assign a few black officers, black 
second-tenants. They were beginning to graduate

18:04.859 --> 18:07.461
from OCSs. And this may sound strange, but I had 
many of them tell me that they did not want to be

18:08.882 --> 18:18.310
commanded by black officers. They'd much rather 
had white officers. Why was that? I don't know,

18:22.434 --> 18:32.365
unless it was a feeling of lack of ability and lack 
of confidence in their leadership. I really don't

18:32.565 --> 18:33.326
know. But I know I've had many of them ask me, as 
these black officers began to be assigned to this

18:33.646 --> 18:44.618
unit, would they someday have all black officers? 
Of course, I didn't know. tell them I thought it'd

18:48.158 --> 18:54.807
be a long while and each time the comment was well we 
hope not. Do you think that was a general feeling or

18:56.870 --> 19:07.205
was that you think that that was a feeling for you 
maybe they respected you as an individual? No I

19:07.225 --> 19:17.980
think I think the other officers had the same 
feeling now the of course it may have been the ones

19:07.225 --> 19:17.980
who were

19:19.732 --> 19:34.767
in the area of knowing their responsibility and 
feeling that they wanted to do a good job, and they

19:19.732 --> 19:34.767
were afraid that the leadership of the blacks 
would not give them a good job they wanted. And I'm

19:34.807 --> 19:35.608
not sure. But each and every time that question was 
asked of me, their response was, well, they had

19:36.449 --> 19:44.997
rather have the white officers. Now, that might 
not be the case today. Yeah, what do you think we're

19:47.555 --> 19:49.217
doing? This was a good many years ago. That's very 
interesting. Now, right after the war, of course,

19:52.099 --> 19:59.706
in about 1948, President Truman signed the 
executive order which integrated the armed

19:52.099 --> 19:59.706
forces. What was your feeling about that? What can 
I say? Too bad you can't join us. Let me put it this

20:04.210 --> 20:05.231
way. I grew up in the South. I grew up serving, 
working, and playing, and dealing with blacks all

20:07.173 --> 20:15.000
my life. My feeling was, and I said this many times 
back there, that the best utilization of the

20:17.140 --> 20:28.915
blacks would have been in an integrated 
condition. Because of this lack of their feeling

20:29.016 --> 20:43.755
of sense of responsibility to others and the fact 
that their leadership abilities are not about it

20:44.360 --> 21:06.385
or were not as high as as the same number of white 
people and it's uh it may be partly because they

20:44.360 --> 21:06.385
didn't want to assume leadership it may have been 
partly because they weren't capable

20:44.360 --> 21:06.385
the better way to use I think you

21:06.820 --> 21:26.062
use their efficiency a whole lot better if you can 
mix them together and that way you so-called raise

21:06.820 --> 21:26.062
the capability level. What do you think was the 
impact of Truman's order on the reserves? You were

21:32.790 --> 21:34.532
in the reserves at that time. Well, I don't 
remember specifically, except that, you know,

21:36.031 --> 21:42.598
that never bothered me at all. Well, I mean, did the 
reserves now start accepting blacks in

21:42.779 --> 21:46.823
integrated units? Oh, yeah. Did the number of 
blacks in your unit, for example, start to grow?

21:51.708 --> 22:02.561
Not really, because they were really not 
interested in getting in the reserve nearly as

21:51.708 --> 22:02.561
much as the whites for, I guess, a variety of 
reasons. I'm not real sure.

22:06.457 --> 22:35.974
one thing may have been that they were out trying to 
get started in life and didn't could not get time

22:06.457 --> 22:35.974
off for reserves or it may have been that they they 
may have felt that they would still be

22:06.457 --> 22:35.974
discriminated against I'm not real sure of what 
but the number of blacks was very very low in the

22:06.457 --> 22:35.974
reserve even on you retired in 1971 that's right oh 
no no I'm talking about Back then, but yes, I know,

22:36.443 --> 22:40.769
but did it start to grow? Oh yes, oh yeah. By the time 
I retired, there were many blacks in the reserve.

22:47.539 --> 22:59.717
In fact, when I retired, we had a major at that time, 
a black major on my staff. Very fine offshore. But

23:02.354 --> 23:04.116
we had lots of blacks. We had lots of good blacks.

23:08.702 --> 23:17.012
It may sound fun to say good blacks, but you know, in 
the terminology we're using, that's not a strange

23:08.702 --> 23:17.012
comment. But I've always had a warm place in my 
heart for a man that's capable. I don't really care

23:26.183 --> 23:27.985
what color he is. Right, yeah. When I worked for the 
highway department, we've got some blacks that,

23:30.207 --> 23:39.937
gosh, you know, as fine a people as we had anywhere. 
And we had some of them in this black unit I had. I had

23:46.905 --> 23:53.992
some mechanics when I ran this motor maintenance 
shop that I'd put with anybody's mechanics

23:46.905 --> 23:53.992
anywhere in the world. I actually believe they'd 
have jumped off the cliff for me. I used to get in a

24:00.413 --> 24:07.960
bind and get a lot of vehicles that were down or 
disabled or whatever. If I asked them to work all

24:08.701 --> 24:13.925
night, you know, they would never say a word about 
it. Just what I asked them to do, they'd do. Of

24:17.609 --> 24:27.077
course, I was usually out there, you know, usually 
there with them, but I've always had great

24:17.609 --> 24:27.077
admiration for capable people. I don't care what 
color they are. Why were you transferred from

24:31.126 --> 24:37.776
Coastal Artillery to the Corps of Engineers in 
1944? Well, Coastal Artillery, Seacoast

24:38.978 --> 24:56.704
Artillery, was losing its identity, so to speak, 
because there was not much danger at that time of

24:38.978 --> 24:56.704
any invasion in the United States. And our mission 
up to that time had been seacoast protection in

24:59.830 --> 25:26.968
california and they were phasing out artillery 
outfits and seacoast in particular all of the old

24:59.830 --> 25:26.968
permanent emplacements along the coast of fort 
scott uh fort macarthur down at san diego and the

24:59.830 --> 25:26.968
same in the los angeles area those were were being 
phased out because I presume intelligence said

25:27.505 --> 25:31.389
there would be no invasion of the United States. So 
the unit that we were in was transferred back to the

25:32.310 --> 25:47.724
east and were converted into combat engineer 
battalions and whatnot. And then they did not send

25:47.744 --> 25:53.930
any of we officers to be assigned with those units. 
All those boys would were going back for training

25:56.125 --> 26:00.670
as combat engineers. So the officers...

26:01.691 --> 26:08.878
Josiah. These officers were being relieved from 
the units, and then we were assigned to various

26:10.280 --> 26:21.792
organizations within our own branches. So when 
that happened, I thought it was time for me to get

26:25.572 --> 26:31.081
back in the Corps of Engineers where I really 
belonged. So I made an application to be

26:32.182 --> 26:35.608
transferred back to the Corps of Engineers. I 
stayed back to the Corps of Engineers and was

26:36.289 --> 26:45.222
fortunate in getting that assignment and I went 
then into engineer units. Okay, what was your duty

26:45.783 --> 26:53.976
then in 1944 and 1945?

26:54.547 --> 27:05.765
After being relieved of this artillery unit, I was 
assigned to a, to a white engineer group. Very

27:08.048 --> 27:22.090
shortly thereafter, the group commander wanted 
to send me to Fort Belvoir for retread engineer

27:08.048 --> 27:22.090
training, even though I was an engineer officer, I 
mean an engineer by profession. He wanted me to go

27:22.897 --> 27:33.071
back to Fort Belvoir and take a refresher course in 
army engineering tactics and procedures and

27:22.897 --> 27:33.071
whatnot. So without really having any duties in 
the white outfit, I went back to Fort Belvoir for

27:34.152 --> 27:46.068
six weeks and then came back to the same unit. And at 
that time then, I was assigned to take a company

27:49.323 --> 27:52.427
overseas. Yes, sir. And let me tell you a funny 
thing about that assignment. Excuse me just a

27:57.314 --> 27:58.075
minute. I want you to cut that off. I want you to meet 
my daughter before she leaves. This peculiar

28:03.203 --> 28:08.971
thing about my assignment to this engineer 
company.

28:10.733 --> 28:17.743
When I was in A&M, one of the what we called TAC 
officers, one of the officers who was the regular

28:18.820 --> 28:26.510
army who monitored the ROTC program out there, was 
named Johnson, D.T. Johnson. And his trademark

28:28.432 --> 28:31.936
was this hook pipe that he smoked. Everybody knew 
Colonel Johnson. And he wore little boots. Of

28:37.503 --> 28:44.171
course, engineers have always worn boots near 
that, you know, that's a trademark. But he was most

28:44.191 --> 28:47.916
un-military looking, had a posture that's sort of 
like a duck when you walk in this crooked pipe when

28:48.470 --> 28:56.018
you were a captain. Everybody knew Colonel 
Johnson. So I was summonsed over to this group

29:00.042 --> 29:07.690
headquarters to be interviewed to take on this new 
assignment. They told me that Colonel Johnson

29:08.831 --> 29:13.836
wanted to talk with me. Didn't dawn on me who 
Colonel Johnson was. I walked in this office And

29:19.317 --> 29:20.818
it's Colonel D.T. Johnson, who I had known as a 
captain at A&M, hadn't seen him since. And he was

29:26.164 --> 29:36.513
the regimental command, the group commander, 
calling me in to interview me about taking this

29:26.164 --> 29:36.513
company that he was fixing to send to Europe. He 
picked me because I was an Aggie. Really? That's

29:39.236 --> 29:41.238
what he told me. Did he remember you at all? No. He 
just had too many men under his wing. That's right.

29:47.026 --> 29:50.890
But he told me that he looked through the files of 
the available officers. See, I'd just been

29:50.910 --> 29:56.977
assigned to the thing, and I was not in the 
established command structure. And he said he

29:56.997 --> 30:09.089
felt like he could assign me better than he could 
pull an officer out who had been assigned and been

29:56.997 --> 30:09.089
running a company because I was available and had 
not been assigned. But he said, also, I noticed you

30:10.251 --> 30:16.257
were from A&M, and I have great respect for A&M 
officers. That's what he told me. Now, he may have

30:18.167 --> 30:24.556
been just trying to justify sending me to Europe, 
you know. But he told me that he had a company that

30:24.577 --> 30:30.525
had a 60-day sailing date. It was a good company, 
but it had had a weak company commander. And that he

30:35.191 --> 30:38.035
wanted to sign me that company to go to Europe. And 
he was right. It was a good company, and I could tell

30:40.679 --> 30:46.227
that it had had weak leadership. But the point of my 
story was, here I run into a fellow that I'd known

30:46.595 --> 30:52.603
down at A&M. Never thought about him being a full 
colonel. So I took the company. So you were given

30:59.032 --> 31:01.917
the commandment of the company? That's right. I 
was captain at that time. And how many men did you

31:05.001 --> 31:07.064
have under your command? 185. It was a separate 
company. It wasn't attached to any regiment. It

31:13.112 --> 31:14.374
wasn't attached to... any higher headquarters we 
we went over as a casual company which meant that i

31:15.097 --> 31:45.036
was you know really i was totally in command 
without any higher headquarters to look to and you

31:15.097 --> 31:45.036
were in charge then of the of the uh one two seven 
four labor uh so that was later this was not it this

31:15.097 --> 31:45.036
was the 519th engineering maintenance oh i see 
yeah okay that's the unit that i took to europe okay

31:46.771 --> 31:50.855
So we processed and got on the boat and went to 
Europe. And it was a good outfit. What did you think

31:54.659 --> 31:58.042
of finally getting to the war? Here you've been in 
America now. You've been in the service for four

32:00.725 --> 32:05.450
years, and you hadn't seen any combat for years. 
Well, really and truly, I was, you know, I felt

32:06.751 --> 32:11.496
like, you know...
