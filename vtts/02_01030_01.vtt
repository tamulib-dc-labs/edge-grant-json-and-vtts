Testing, one, two, three.

00:12.946 --> 00:25.802
This is an interview with Dr. Mark Troy by Marshall 
McInnes on May the 11th, 1993 at Texas A&M

00:12.946 --> 00:25.802
University concerning his days in college, the 
Peace Corps, and his feelings about the Vietnam

00:12.946 --> 00:25.802
War. In the interest of accumulating knowledge, I 
am asking you to donate this tape to me or the Texas

00:26.407 --> 00:34.275
A&M oral history collection in the university 
archives. Is that all right with you? That's fine.

00:37.278 --> 00:39.320
What is your full name? Mark Edward Troy. And when 
and where were you born? St. Louis, Missouri,

00:43.324 --> 00:45.867
February 22, 1947. And what is your education? I 
have a doctorate in psychology from the

00:51.533 --> 00:55.637
University of Hawaii.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.351
Now we'll get into some of the interview 
questions. What year did you enter college, and

01:03.033 --> 01:06.138
where did you go to school? I entered college in 
1965. I entered a seminary in 1965. I was in there

01:16.796 --> 01:20.001
for a year and a half. In January 1967, I entered 
Quincy College in Quincy, Illinois. All right,

01:26.988 --> 01:37.102
describe the college in terms of its size, the 
attitudes of the students and faculty, and just

01:26.988 --> 01:37.102
the general air about the campus at the time you 
entered the college at Quincy. Quincy College?

01:38.404 --> 01:44.473
All right, Quincy was a small Catholic liberal 
arts college at that time. It had about 2,000

01:44.493 --> 01:46.235
students. Some of the faculty were Franciscan 
priests. Some of them were laypersons.

01:57.987 --> 02:06.141
students were kind of a mix of students in terms of 
social attitudes. Some of them were

02:06.241 --> 02:15.457
fairly conservative, others were fairly 
liberal. They kind of spanned the whole spectrum.

02:23.688 --> 02:35.945
Since it was a Catholic co-ed college, you tended 
to have students who were

02:23.688 --> 02:35.945
fairly religious in some ways. If you weren't 
somehow religiously oriented, it wasn't too

02:35.965 --> 02:43.054
likely that you'd go there. We didn't have 
fraternities or sororities, but we did have

02:44.957 --> 02:52.547
service organizations, which were fairly fairly 
popular.

02:56.274 --> 02:59.377
Were there any demonstrations on campus during 
the time you were there? If there were, what kinds

03:00.318 --> 03:02.481
and over what?

03:09.769 --> 03:17.037
There were several demonstrations, but they 
weren't sit-in type demonstrations or anything

03:09.769 --> 03:17.037
like that. There was one vigil I remember for for 
peace. There was some concern, some unrest, I

03:24.337 --> 03:34.512
guess, shortly after the Democratic National 
Convention in 1968. A lot of students were angry

03:34.993 --> 03:37.837
about that. Some of the other protests mainly,

03:38.958 --> 03:49.433
I guess, Just large groups of people meeting in 
front of the residence halls concerned more the

03:51.218 --> 04:01.848
hours and some of the restrictions on the 
residence halls than anything else. And what did

04:04.130 --> 04:06.092
you do after you left Quincy? Excuse me a second.

04:10.596 --> 04:19.605
After Quincy, I went to Washington University in 
St. Louis to get a master's degree. And after that,

04:20.075 --> 04:26.500
after getting my master's degree, I joined the 
Peace Corps. Were you ever considering

04:26.540 --> 04:31.384
volunteering for service in the United States 
Armed Services? And how did you feel about the

04:31.785 --> 04:36.689
lottery once it was established? OK, and those are 
a couple questions, actually.

04:41.813 --> 04:43.915
Service in the Armed Services. Yeah, in fact, I did 
volunteer. I did pretty much what? What Bill

04:51.023 --> 04:55.888
Clinton did, when I went to graduate school, I 
signed up for ROTC. And the

04:56.629 --> 05:05.900
problem was that it was easier to get into ROTC than 
it was to get into graduate school. And it's the one

05:05.940 --> 05:13.268
that came down to actually making the commitment, 
going to summer camp officers candidate school

05:13.906 --> 05:30.081
training between graduation and Washington U. I 
still hadn't been accepted at Washington U. I

05:13.906 --> 05:30.081
hadn't been accepted anywhere, and so I couldn't 
accept the officers candidate school thing. I had

05:30.722 --> 05:31.803
to decline that. So

05:33.084 --> 05:41.112
that was the one consideration I had with 
volunteering. Then when I did finally get

05:44.747 --> 05:53.279
accepted into Washington U, it was too late and I 
could not get back into OCS. The summer was over,

05:54.060 --> 06:04.093
the summer training was over, and Washington U's 
ROTC was already filled.

06:04.654 --> 06:10.862
The lottery, well, that was the one thing that got 
me out of the draft, I was fairly happy for that.

06:17.786 --> 06:31.745
Because I had one whole semester in graduate 
school where

06:17.786 --> 06:31.745
the concern about the draft was a problem. I was 
already engaged, I wanted to stay in graduate

06:31.765 --> 06:37.913
school, but I was also eligible for the draft. I was 
classified 1A and I made it into the lottery just at

06:40.736 --> 06:50.190
the time that all my appeals had run out.

06:53.555 --> 06:57.480
What were the attitudes of the students and 
professors at Washington when you entered? Well,

06:58.822 --> 07:06.533
Washington U was fairly liberal in terms of its 
politics. It was among the universities in the St.

07:07.839 --> 07:17.033
Louis area and probably in the Midwest, it's 
probably the most liberal in its outlook.

07:17.053 --> 07:32.016
Although you still have fairly conservative 
professors there, but for the most part you also

07:17.053 --> 07:32.016
had a large number of very liberal professors and 
the students that went there tended to be fairly

07:17.053 --> 07:32.016
liberal. Even though they did have in ROTC on 
campus, and students did participate in that.

07:45.668 --> 07:48.572
Well, it filled up all the slots. For the most part, 
I would say the students were very liberal. Did you

07:53.578 --> 07:58.324
participate in any campus activities, protests, 
demonstrations at Washington? Yeah,

07:59.605 --> 08:04.431
after Kent State I participated in a number of 
demonstrations there. There were some

08:08.842 --> 08:14.330
demonstrations at Washington U prior to Kent 
State. One was around the ROTC building. I didn't

08:17.715 --> 08:19.417
participate in that. I didn't really think that 
that was right. I didn't see anything wrong with

08:23.263 --> 08:31.735
students being in ROTC.

08:32.761 --> 08:41.258
the Kent State protests and particularly after 
the incursion into Cambodia and everything. I was

08:41.759 --> 08:52.100
opposed to the war and I didn't like the actions of 
the National Guard after Kent or the incursion

08:41.759 --> 08:52.100
into Cambodia. So, Washington, you actually was 
one of the universities that went on strike and

08:56.167 --> 09:05.457
shut down, the students shut it down over the Kent 
State protests, and I took part in those. Describe

09:05.497 --> 09:11.063
your initial feelings about the Vietnam War, 
specifically on America's involvement in the

09:05.497 --> 09:11.063
war.

09:13.926 --> 09:19.592
Well, my initial feelings were that

09:21.867 --> 09:22.909
I supported the war. When I started hearing about 
the war in high school, I was primarily a supporter

09:22.929 --> 09:29.722
of the war. I supported the domino theory and that 
sort of thing. Actually, in high school I was a

09:37.838 --> 09:42.627
member of group that supported Goldwater for 
Presidents in the 1964 campaign. It was primarily

09:50.770 --> 09:58.241
because of his position on Vietnam.

09:58.261 --> 10:00.024
Q How did your family feel about the war?

10:03.650 --> 10:10.420
A

10:03.650 --> 10:10.420
My family, for the most part, was opposed to the 
war. It's hard to say when

10:12.691 --> 10:20.683
they began to be opposed to it.

10:21.885 --> 10:25.891
My father was probably one of the first people I 
knew who was opposed to the war in Vietnam. And I'm

10:26.932 --> 10:35.024
not sure exactly when he took that position. I'm 
not sure exactly what his position the Goldwater

10:39.509 --> 10:50.683
Johnson campaign was either, but at least among 
all the adults I knew he was the first person to be

10:39.509 --> 10:50.683
opposed to it. Was there any specific incident 
which made you for or against the war in Vietnam?

11:04.642 --> 11:05.803
I don't know that there was any specific incident. 
There were certain incidents I recall, and

11:09.618 --> 11:16.986
my opinions on it changed over time. The first time 
that I really began to think deeply about the war

11:17.046 --> 11:31.302
was

11:17.046 --> 11:31.302
the battle, the Yad Drang battle. And my first 
response to that, I remember this, was that It was

11:37.188 --> 11:41.172
the first time North Vietnamese regulars were 
involved in the war. And my response was, my God,

11:41.733 --> 11:45.657
that's unfair. What are those guys doing in there? 
Of course,

11:48.780 --> 11:54.746
their regular army were fighting our regular 
army, is the thing. It seems silly now to call that

11:54.766 --> 11:57.008
unfair. But at the time, it was. And I was still 
leaning more towards supporting the war in

11:59.891 --> 12:06.418
Vietnam. That was also the first time that I knew of 
anybody that was killed in Vietnam. There was a

12:11.044 --> 12:21.199
brother, a friend of mine, who was killed in that 
particular battle, and so I had kind of mixed

12:11.044 --> 12:21.199
feelings.

12:22.161 --> 12:27.589
But that also caused a lot of discussion among 
myself and my friends and all that about the war. It

12:28.570 --> 12:33.958
became probably the main topic.

12:35.643 --> 12:40.350
The next incident that I recall was another friend 
of mine who was killed. This guy was a guy that was

12:40.390 --> 12:51.086
about two years ahead of me. He was a seminarian. We 
didn't have fish camp or anything like that. But we

12:57.555 --> 13:02.983
did have guys from the older classes who would make 
it their responsibility to take care of the

13:03.233 --> 13:05.576
freshmen and so on when they came in. And he was one 
of those guys. And so he was a real good friend and

13:08.000 --> 13:13.027
everything. He decided at some point that he 
didn't want to be a priest and left the seminary.

13:18.776 --> 13:25.085
And generally, that meant that he got drafted 
before he could do anything else. And so he was

13:25.205 --> 13:31.975
killed about five days after getting to Vietnam. 
And it was one of those incidents we, a

13:32.647 --> 13:40.997
couple friends of mine and I went out. We were 
watching a movie. We were watching a documentary

13:42.559 --> 13:44.642
on Vietnam. We came back. I think we came back to my 
house. And the phone just started ringing off the

13:48.687 --> 13:53.893
hook because the news had come out that this guy had 
gotten killed. So all of us were just calling each

13:53.933 --> 13:57.818
other and everything. It was one of those times 
when you really start to feel angry. And that

14:02.870 --> 14:20.826
probably changed me a lot, although by that time I 
think I had

14:02.870 --> 14:20.826
become opposed to it and talked to a lot of people 
and everything and was opposed to the

14:02.870 --> 14:20.826
involvement. But that was an incident that made me 
real angry about it. When did you leave Washington

14:28.432 --> 14:31.695
and what did you do after you left? I left 
Washington U at the

14:33.785 --> 14:43.176
beginning of 1972 to join the Peace Corps. 
Alright, and where did you go in the Peace Corps? I

14:49.764 --> 14:50.625
was in Thailand. And where were you located in 
Thailand? The first spot was a location

15:05.088 --> 15:11.677
sort of in the north central area called Pits on the 
Loak. And did you go by yourself or did someone else

15:11.697 --> 15:14.922
go with you? Well, my wife went with me. We were 
married at the time. Were there any signs of the

15:19.528 --> 15:24.755
Vietnam War where you were located in Thailand? 
Yeah, we had a

15:25.596 --> 15:31.825
lot of indications all over Thailand. Thailand 
was... both major R&R area for soldiers from

15:34.450 --> 15:47.730
Vietnam, and there were also a lot of bases there, 
active bases, most of them air bases that were

15:34.450 --> 15:47.730
involved in bombing. Where we were actually 
located was not considered a military town, but

15:48.752 --> 16:00.390
the

16:01.552 --> 16:03.434
The Thai Army had a headquarters there. I can't 
remember which army. I think it was the Thai 4th

16:05.096 --> 16:07.898
Army, but I'm not certain about that. And so 
associated with that was a group of advisors. I

16:14.585 --> 16:16.667
think there were probably about a dozen in the 
unit. It was called JUSMAC, Joint U.S. Military

16:16.868 --> 16:21.132
Advisory Command. It was either JUSMAC for 
command or JUSMAG for group, and I think they used

16:21.833 --> 16:26.858
both terms. They were primarily officers. I don't 
think that there were... any enlisted men, mainly

16:31.724 --> 16:49.464
officers, and their headquarters was not too far 
from us, just a few blocks actually, and so we'd see

16:31.724 --> 16:49.464
them all the time. They were friendly guys. We'd go 
sit around and talk with them a lot, just to kind of

16:50.805 --> 17:01.157
get an idea of what was going on and everything. 
There was also a radar station there that was an

17:01.660 --> 17:15.353
installation used by the planes leaving some of 
the other military bases heading towards

17:01.660 --> 17:15.353
Vietnam.

17:19.157 --> 17:22.540
How did you feel about the war once you reached 
Thailand? Did your feelings change?

17:32.272 --> 17:42.184
Funny thing, in

17:32.272 --> 17:42.184
a lot of ways my feelings were in response to the 
Thais' feelings about the war. The Thais were very

17:42.204 --> 17:47.010
supportive of the war in Vietnam, at least the Thai 
government was. And one of the problems was that

17:47.891 --> 18:01.688
the

17:47.891 --> 18:01.688
government was, for the most part when we were 
there, was a fairly oppressive military

17:47.891 --> 18:01.688
government. Well, I shouldn't say it was fairly 
oppressive. It was a military government. Maybe

18:07.063 --> 18:14.914
in terms of dictatorships, it was less oppressive 
than some of the others that we're familiar with.

18:16.396 --> 18:24.407
But still, they ran the country in what I 
considered an oppressive type of manner. There

18:24.447 --> 18:31.978
was not a lot of free thought, speech, movement, 
that sort of thing. And a lot of the people, Thais

18:33.292 --> 18:41.360
themselves, tend to like

18:33.292 --> 18:41.360
that. It's not that they were really chafing under 
this type of government. They

18:46.926 --> 18:52.572
like strong leaders. They have a monarchy and have 
always had a monarchy. And they like the fact that

18:56.596 --> 19:02.843
their military leaders are are strong.

19:08.918 --> 19:15.364
What I would hear from Thais when I talked to them 
was that they liked Nixon because Nixon seemed

19:08.918 --> 19:15.364
like a powerful figure to them. And so I'd get into 
conversations and I would try to tell them on my

19:16.485 --> 19:30.940
side that I thought that the law was wrong and that I 
didn't like the things he was doing to their

19:16.485 --> 19:30.940
country.

19:33.113 --> 19:38.179
small cities of prostitutes building up around 
the air bases. You had rampant inflation. You had

19:41.463 --> 19:59.644
all

19:41.463 --> 19:59.644
sorts of problems that seemed like they were the 
result of the

19:41.463 --> 19:59.644
military presence being in Thailand.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.299
funny thing happened. After Saigon fell, the 
Thais did very much of an about-face, and this

20:01.359 --> 20:16.378
strain of anti-Americanism developed.

20:18.341 --> 20:20.263
So I found myself on the other side now. They were 
saying many of the things that I'd been saying

20:20.283 --> 20:29.074
before, but now I found myself defending much of 
the American position in the world and the

20:29.510 --> 20:36.138
response to communism. So in many ways it was, I did 
do a complete about-face, but I

20:36.158 --> 20:52.739
adjusted my positions a little bit. I took a more 
moderate position, I guess. in response to more

20:56.037 --> 21:01.825
radical Thai positions at that point. What did the 
soldiers that you talked to in Thailand, how did

21:01.865 --> 21:12.180
they feel about the war, the advisor group?

21:13.382 --> 21:15.846
Well, they were professional soldiers. They were 
there because the military was their career and

21:17.789 --> 21:23.597
they were strongly supportive of the U.S. 
involvement.

21:34.579 --> 21:47.374
So our discussions there tended to be more,

21:34.579 --> 21:47.374
well, Basically, we pretty much knew each other's 
position and so we didn't get into heated debates

21:47.692 --> 21:54.505
about it. About the only time that we did get into 
debates was, and this wasn't even a real debate,

21:55.286 --> 22:10.375
but it was just a little discussion, was in the 
Nixon-McGovern election in 72.

22:13.443 --> 22:22.433
to file an absentee ballot, we had to take it over to 
the commander of the base to get it authorized. You

22:22.654 --> 22:27.559
know, he had to sign it in, and so we got into a little 
discussion then. He said that his vote would

22:28.761 --> 22:40.294
cancel one of our votes, and so then we started 
talking about, you know, the various positions in

22:28.761 --> 22:40.294
the election.

22:47.260 --> 22:59.257
Would you like to describe your involvement 
within the student movement while you were at

22:47.260 --> 22:59.257
college and elaborate on some of the things that 
you did that you felt that were important in the

22:47.260 --> 22:59.257
movement? Well,

22:59.277 --> 23:15.681
most of my involvement was when I was at Washington 
U.

22:59.277 --> 23:15.681
Quincy College wasn't terribly involved in in 
large-scale protests, partly because it was a

23:16.825 --> 23:27.715
small college and

23:16.825 --> 23:27.715
the town itself was a fairly conservative 
community. On the other hand, the faculty, in many

23:28.276 --> 23:35.603
ways, were willing to go along with the protests. 
They were present at one protest vigil we had and

23:35.623 --> 23:39.927
everything like that. At Washington U, it was a lot 
different. is located right in St. Louis. It draws

23:48.147 --> 23:51.672
students from all over the world. Like I said, 
they're fairly liberal. There's a whole

23:54.657 --> 24:01.467
community around Washington U, even though St. 
Louis itself is a fairly conservative city. The

24:02.068 --> 24:11.942
community that surrounds Washington U is itself 
very liberal, and so there were quite a number of

24:12.867 --> 24:27.627
organizers on campus, student organizers, and 
many of them were involved in the strike after the

24:12.867 --> 24:27.627
Kent State incident. And so there were rallies all 
the time. In fact, it was very exciting. The

24:33.074 --> 24:42.587
Washington U is designed as one of these real old 
universities with all the buildings surrounding

24:33.074 --> 24:42.587
the quadrangle.

24:44.305 --> 24:47.608
which is the central focus of the university. And 
so you'd go to Washington U, and you'd walk through

24:47.628 --> 24:59.720
the Quadrangle, and there would just be all these 
people there holding rallies and speakers set up.

25:01.742 --> 25:06.787
A lot of activists came to the university, 
nationally known activists. Some were on the

25:07.828 --> 25:10.110
faculty. Barry Comner, who was an environmental 
activist, was on the faculty. And of course, the

25:16.047 --> 25:23.895
environmental activists also got involved in the 
peace movement and so on. Many of the faculty were

25:24.076 --> 25:26.979
involved in that. David Harris, Joan Baez's 
husband, ex-husband, came to the campus I think at

25:28.160 --> 25:39.692
least once and spoke. So I was involved in a lot of 
marches, a lot of protests, a lot of

25:40.398 --> 25:48.966
demonstrations.

25:50.948 --> 25:59.276
One of the things that happened during the strike 
was that they attempted to coordinate it with all

25:50.948 --> 25:59.276
the other universities to coordinate the 
activities. They wanted to shut down

25:59.777 --> 26:03.881
universities all across the country. They wanted 
to have all sorts of demonstrations planned in all

26:03.921 --> 26:10.287
the cities. So I was involved with one of the 
committees at Washington U that was coordinating

26:11.195 --> 26:18.105
that, actually. There were a lot of committees. 
And my only real act of civil disobedience in that

26:19.928 --> 26:39.497
whole thing was I needed to contact one other 
university and didn't have any money to do it. I

26:40.135 --> 26:54.250
called up a radio station that was billed as an 
outlaw radio station and asked them if they had a

26:40.135 --> 26:54.250
phone number that I could use, a credit card number 
that I could charge. I guess probably not a credit

26:55.271 --> 27:00.116
card, but a number that I could charge a call to. And 
they gave me a number. And when I asked who it was,

27:01.497 --> 27:05.822
they said it was the White House's number. and that 
I should just use Nixon's name. So I did. I placed a

27:09.263 --> 27:14.551
call and said I wanted to charge it to this number. 
And they asked, well, who do I charge it to? And I

27:18.818 --> 27:26.409
said to charge it to RM Nixon, N-I-X-O-N. And they 
accepted the call without question. I have no idea

27:26.470 --> 27:29.534
if that was actually his number. But at least I got 
the call through. I think it went to Brown

27:31.718 --> 27:34.662
University or someplace like that. But that was my 
only thing with civil disobedience. The other

27:40.823 --> 27:54.081
people I was involved with during the protest 
movement were people like the American Friends

27:40.823 --> 27:54.081
Service Committee, the Quakers, basically, who 
were pacifists. I wasn't a pacifist, but I did go to

27:54.101 --> 27:59.649
them for draft counseling. The interesting thing 
about that was that They gave me a list of

28:03.565 --> 28:13.237
procedures to follow in constructing and making 
an appeal

28:03.565 --> 28:13.237
to appeal my draft status. And the idea was that 
you, according to the law, you had to have your

28:13.798 --> 28:21.969
appeal within this X number of days and so on. And 
the boards met on specific days. And you could buy

28:24.532 --> 28:33.083
time by counting the days and then hand-carrying 
your appeal in. You waited until you had 30 days,

28:33.468 --> 28:39.913
and I think the board met once a month. So once I got 
the notice and I counted the days and found out when

28:41.775 --> 28:57.508
the next board meeting was going to be held, and I'd 
go in and deliver my appeal after that board

28:41.775 --> 28:57.508
meeting because then they couldn't consider that 
appeal until the next board meeting and so on and so

28:41.775 --> 28:57.508
on. Instead of 30 days, I'd get 60 days on it and so 
on. The American Defense Service Committee

29:03.353 --> 29:07.418
worked all that out for me. But the interesting 
thing about that was that

29:07.438 --> 29:15.948
my draft board were kind of cool guys. I don't know 
how other people's draft boards were, but I went to

29:15.968 --> 29:24.398
my first meeting with the draft board, my appeal 
hearing. You had to request a personal appearance

29:24.418 --> 29:27.041
before the draft board. That was one of the first 
steps. So I went to them. and requested an appeal on

29:30.843 --> 29:37.891
the basis of being a graduate student. They denied 
it, but they also said, but now these are the next

29:37.911 --> 29:43.578
steps you can take. And they were exactly the same 
steps that the American Friends Service

29:43.618 --> 29:47.743
Committee had told me to take. It was just count the 
days, and this is when we're going to meet, and so

29:48.443 --> 29:58.555
you bring in the letter afterwards and all that, 
which kind of floored me that They were giving me

29:59.092 --> 30:02.175
all that appeal information. Then my next contact 
with the draft board was when we went to Thailand.

30:09.641 --> 30:13.965
Even though I had a high number in the lottery, I was 
still eligible for the draft. I was still

30:14.025 --> 30:19.970
classified as 1A status. In actual fact, I was out 
of the draft. Technically, I wasn't. So I had to get

30:26.055 --> 30:27.917
permission from my draft board. So I went to the 
draft board to get the paperwork done, get all the

30:28.960 --> 30:34.265
permission. A woman asked me where I was going. I 
said, well, I'm going to Thailand. And she said,

30:40.990 --> 30:50.358
we've been trying all these years to keep you guys 
out of there, and now you want to go? And I said,

30:51.600 --> 30:55.263
well, yeah, that's right. Which I thought was kind 
of a... cool thing for them to do, too.

31:47.497 --> 31:49.643
I love.

32:17.028 --> 32:33.883
Every

32:17.028 --> 32:33.883
night and every day. Yes, I love you for all the 
wrong reasons. Cause you love me in all the right

32:35.446 --> 32:36.488
ways.

33:19.499 --> 33:46.587
I was a-walkin' down Broadway New York, New York 
Turnin' llama boots and a stepson hat Proud to be a

33:19.499 --> 33:46.587
country boy Just then a messenger called me Asked a 
man on the road He said, you gotta get the rhythm of

33:19.499 --> 33:46.587

into reggae cowboy. Shuffle them boots on the

33:56.226 --> 33:58.430

refrains on a steel guitar beautiful rhythms on

tell me get into reggae cowboy

36:10.831 --> 36:37.530

36:10.831 --> 36:37.530
girl likes to cruise in daddy's pickup

36:10.831 --> 36:37.530
truck Any redneck girl plays her heart when she's 
down on her luck

36:10.831 --> 36:37.530
Livin' for a Friday afternoon

36:48.631 --> 36:53.019
I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl.

36:56.525 --> 37:03.557
A redneck girl likes to stay out all night long.

37:03.577 --> 37:08.766
She makes sweet rock and roll while she listens to 
the country songs.

37:20.963 --> 37:31.598
I will

37:20.963 --> 37:31.598
find me a redneck girl

38:08.197 --> 38:25.682
a redneck girl

38:08.197 --> 38:25.682

38:08.197 --> 38:25.682
redneck girl got her name on the back of her belt

38:38.133 --> 38:56.108
is howling

38:38.133 --> 38:56.108
out on the prairie first comes love and then comes 
marriage and i pray that someday i will find me a

38:38.133 --> 38:56.108
redneck girl

39:58.863 --> 40:09.338
Oh baby,

39:58.863 --> 40:09.338
stoned on your love. Baby, I've got to say, baby, 
you're driving me mad.

40:18.671 --> 40:23.318
Baby, I've got to say, baby, I've got to say you're 
good.

40:30.132 --> 40:51.820
baby I'm gone on your sweetness oh baby

40:30.132 --> 40:51.820
stoned on your love I got a strong weakness I got a 
strong weakness I got a strong weakness baby I got a

40:53.167 --> 41:01.455
strong

41:38.273 --> 41:47.834
Forget about her eyes that dance around like 
diamonds in the night. Forget about her hair that

41:50.160 --> 41:57.075
cascades like a fountain in the moonlight.

42:01.358 --> 42:10.956
And don't think of her sweet lips that leave me just 
as drunk as any wine.

42:10.976 --> 42:19.873
Though her body is immortal,

42:10.976 --> 42:19.873
I love her mine.

42:24.950 --> 42:31.583
She always thinks of new ways to take me from the 
heat into the fire. Oh, it's heaven when your lover

42:33.868 --> 42:43.667
knows all your desires.

42:48.035 --> 43:03.192
And when I'm lying there beside her In the 
afterglow of love I feel so fine

42:48.035 --> 43:03.192
And if I have to name my favorite place

43:11.963 --> 43:40.570
Just when I think I've figured her out She comes up 
with a new game Something she made up in that pretty

43:11.963 --> 43:40.570
head And when I can no longer hold out And I'm 
melting there in her flame She takes my hand and

43:11.963 --> 43:40.570
leads to that feather bed Oh, that bed

43:11.963 --> 43:40.570
Poets always dwell on All the things that can be 
seen

43:42.102 --> 44:08.059
From her nose to her toes

43:42.102 --> 44:08.059
And everything between

43:42.102 --> 44:08.059
Though I'll admit that I'm a slave To her beauty, 
let me say it two more times

44:12.477 --> 44:27.651
The way she uses it to love

44:12.477 --> 44:27.651
me I love her mine

44:12.477 --> 44:27.651
Because she uses it to love me

45:01.938 --> 45:30.274
Or the sunshine in the sky And there's a reason Why 
I'm feeling so high Must be the season When that

45:01.938 --> 45:30.274
love light shines All

45:01.938 --> 45:30.274
around us So let that feeling Grab you deep inside 
And send you reeling Where your love can't hide And

45:01.938 --> 45:30.274
then go stealing Through the moonlit

45:35.283 --> 45:39.589
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream.

46:13.437 --> 46:16.763
For the warm, sweet nights, there's a reason. For 
the candle lights must be the season. Windows

46:25.297 --> 46:30.405
love right to shine all around us. So let that 
wonder take you into space and lay you under. It's

46:36.756 --> 46:39.360
loving embrace just feel the thunder.

46:46.681 --> 46:57.433
Just

46:46.681 --> 46:57.433
let your love flow Like a mountain stream And let 
your love grow With the smallest of dreams And let

46:46.681 --> 46:57.433
your love show

47:22.372 --> 47:36.077
Just

47:22.372 --> 47:36.077
let

47:22.372 --> 47:36.077
your love flow like a mountain stream and let your 
love grow with the smallest of dreams and let your

47:22.372 --> 47:36.077
love show and you'll know what I mean.

48:18.532 --> 48:27.204
If I said you have a beautiful body, would you hold 
it against me?

48:27.224 --> 48:35.296
If I swore you were an angel, would you treat me like 
the devil tonight?

48:35.396 --> 48:43.828
If I was dying of thirst, would you flow in love, 
don't quench me. If I said you have a beautiful

48:43.848 --> 48:46.632
body,

48:53.176 --> 48:57.548
We could talk all night about the weather. Could

48:57.568 --> 49:05.852
tell you about my friends out on the coast.

49:26.352 --> 49:46.352
If I was dying of thirst,

49:26.352 --> 49:46.352
would you throw

49:26.352 --> 49:46.352
your love on me?

50:00.220 --> 50:27.831
The rain can fall so soft against the window

50:00.220 --> 50:27.831
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky

50:00.220 --> 50:27.831
But daddy always told me don't make small talk He 
said come on out and say

50:34.409 --> 50:48.366
If the body,

50:34.409 --> 50:48.366
would

50:34.409 --> 50:48.366
you hold it against me? If I swore you were an angel, 
would you treat me like the devil tonight? If I was

50:55.614 --> 50:57.577
dying of thirst, would you blow a love gun against 
me? If I said you have a beautiful body, would you

50:57.597 --> 51:01.902
hold it against me?

51:06.657 --> 51:11.211
If you have a beautiful body, would you hold it 
against me? If I swore you were an angel, would you

51:11.432 --> 51:18.895
treat me like the devil tonight?
