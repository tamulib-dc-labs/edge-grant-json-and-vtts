WEBVTT

00:05.887 --> 00:20.286
But in any case, the four areas I was saying, those 
four, we feel the mechanical engineering

00:05.887 --> 00:20.286
profession, obviously this department, 
addresses three of those in a major way, and that's

00:05.887 --> 00:20.286
materials, productivity, and energy. Water 
resources is an area that we don't get involved in

00:20.567 --> 00:24.833
directly. We don't feel that's a major research 
area for ourselves. The other three we address in a

00:28.658 --> 00:30.901
major way. In the materials area, we feel that's a 
very critical area for the future. It's as

00:35.890 --> 00:37.012
critical as energy. We have a large material group 
that's doing research in very basic

00:37.813 --> 00:59.624
characterization of metals, looking at 
techniques for more energy efficient mechanisms

00:37.813 --> 00:59.624
for producing metals, looking at ways to improve 
metals from both the alloying and surface

00:37.813 --> 00:59.624
treatment. We are looking at ways to improve, for 
instance, a utility of cast iron for very low

01:05.911 --> 01:15.419
temperatures and very high temperature 
application, looking at metals as it applies to

01:05.911 --> 01:15.419
structures, for instance, gas turbines. And on 
the other hand, we're making a large move toward

01:17.561 --> 01:23.907
non-metal materials, plastics, composite 
materials. It appears quite obvious that the

01:24.627 --> 01:34.416
materials of the future are going to be quite 
different than the materials of the past in the

01:24.627 --> 01:34.416
sense of being... composite type materials. We 
have a plastics engineering laboratory that's

01:36.859 --> 01:51.001
concentrating on the manufacturing and 
mechanical properties of high volume plastics,

01:36.859 --> 01:51.001
short fiber composites, problems associated 
with tooling and manufacturing. We just started a

01:51.962 --> 01:55.287
packaging program, just hired a new faculty 
member in that area. We feel obviously that

01:57.471 --> 02:03.019
packaging in whatever form from cereal boxes to 
spacecraft, packaging is a very important part of

02:04.366 --> 02:09.831
our society. It consumes a lot of materials. It 
consumes a lot of energies. We're a very

02:14.856 --> 02:21.223
packaging-oriented society as opposed to a more 
primitive society. Whether it's McDonald's,

02:23.165 --> 02:31.453
hamburgers, or how do you get coal out of Montana, 
packaging is an essential part of modern society.

02:31.771 --> 02:40.466
So manufacturing and materials area is a rapidly 
growing area and a very significant area, we

02:31.771 --> 02:40.466
think, for the state and obviously the nation. 
That touches on some of the research we're doing.

02:44.593 --> 02:47.719
How do you fund this research? About our total 
research budget that I mentioned, last year When

02:54.637 --> 02:58.343
you talk about research dollars, you need to 
specify a little bit. If I talk about research in

02:58.924 --> 03:05.755
place, contracts in place during the last fiscal 
year, it was about $2.25 million. If you talk about

03:06.496 --> 03:17.474
cash flow, the dollars spent from the first fiscal 
year to the last fiscal year, it's about $1.75

03:06.496 --> 03:17.474
million, which means some of the contracts 
overlap the beginning and the end of the year. Out

03:18.336 --> 03:18.636
of that 1 and 3 quarter million, about 10% of state 
funds or university funds from the engineering

03:18.937 --> 03:26.947
experiment station. The rest is sponsored 
research from other agencies. All of that, about a

03:31.713 --> 03:43.046
rough guess, 60% to 65% would be from federal 
agencies, the remainder from Texas industry.

03:43.487 --> 03:46.811
What are some of the federal agencies that have 
research ? Oh, NASA. Air Force, Department of

03:48.198 --> 03:56.251
Energy, National Science Foundation,

03:48.198 --> 03:56.251
Veterans Administration.

04:05.425 --> 04:07.649
I don't think we have anything for the Navy right 
now. Did I mention the Air Force Army?

04:12.717 --> 04:13.598
Currently, we don't. I said Department of Energy. 
Of course, Department of Energy takes care of a lot

04:15.404 --> 04:17.646
of different areas. We did have some contracts, 
which I'm not sure have terminated or are still in

04:17.686 --> 04:28.638
effect from the nuclear side, Los Alamos 
Laboratories.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.962
That's the primary agencies. Another one doesn't 
come to mind right now. This National Science

04:35.244 --> 04:39.889
Foundation has been criticized by some members of 
Congress financial research that's of an alleged

04:40.392 --> 04:44.977
wasteful nature. Do you have any comment on this? 
Well, not in engineering. I have some criticism

04:48.181 --> 04:51.245
for National Science Foundation. But I 
personally have seen no research National

04:52.586 --> 05:04.060
Science Foundation has sponsored in engineering 
that I have been associated with that I would

04:52.586 --> 05:04.060
consider wasteful. Only in the extent, first let 
me say what I believe an engineer is. And let me say

05:09.215 --> 05:15.645
what I believe the difference between an engineer 
and a scientist, what the differences are.

05:18.549 --> 05:27.923
I think it has nothing to do with intellectual 
capacity, but it has a difference to do with the

05:18.549 --> 05:27.923
objective that the various professions have. I'd 
like to characterize it. A scientist, whether

05:30.447 --> 05:36.336
he's a physicist or a chemist, typically takes the 
role and is educated to such an extent that he is

05:36.940 --> 05:54.668
educated as an investigator, which we often use 
the word investigator, and his search usually is

05:36.940 --> 05:54.668
for a truth that's known but not known to him. It's a 
fact in nature that is hidden and so he's He's

06:00.886 --> 06:07.136
essentially searching for truth and knowledge 
that's existing, but not necessarily uncovered.

06:08.058 --> 06:17.513
An engineer, on the other hand, I think, as I often 
say, has, if you may have noticed outside, it says

06:08.058 --> 06:17.513
mechanical engineering is a creative 
profession. I feel an engineer has to have the

06:18.635 --> 06:24.545
ability to use the tools of a scientist. He has to 
have the same skills of a... use the same

06:28.797 --> 06:30.900
mathematical tools as a physicist. He has to have 
the same ability to use a computer as a

06:31.480 --> 06:34.464
mathematician. He has to be conversant with the 
same chemistry as a chemical engineer does with a

06:34.885 --> 06:42.834
chemist. But he has to have one more ingredient, 
certainly in mechanical engineering. He has to

06:47.200 --> 06:49.002
have the creative ability of an artist. He has to 
have a mixture of both. Because he's not called

06:52.887 --> 06:55.530
upon just to search for truth. but to typically 
leave a product, to innovate something that came

06:56.759 --> 07:05.507
out of his vision of his mind to solve a problem. And 
so if you think about an engineer, and I don't mean

07:06.629 --> 07:17.799
necessarily just a degree, many good physicists 
or educated in physics are very good engineers.

07:17.819 --> 07:26.648
But if you can talk about the difference in 
attitude, an engineer

07:17.819 --> 07:26.648
must have a strong visual capability. to be able to 
see products that don't exist in nature but that he

07:27.691 --> 07:35.301
is creating. And so the attitude between a 
scientist and an engineer has to be somewhat

07:36.423 --> 07:43.453
different. The same individual could obviously 
be either. The National Science Foundation has

07:48.079 --> 07:55.529
been

07:48.079 --> 07:55.529
completely dominated by scientists. There are 
essentially no engineers in the National Science

07:56.817 --> 08:00.340
Foundation. Now, very recently there are a few, 
primarily because of a large movement in

08:00.360 --> 08:07.346
engineering to create a National Engineering 
Foundation. And so there has been a movement by the

08:08.768 --> 08:14.012
National Science Foundation to say, yes, we have 
engineers too. In fact, the brand new director is

08:14.493 --> 08:17.415
an engineer. But because the influence from 
scientists was such that scientific research,

08:26.399 --> 08:38.897
understanding the difference, was funded as 
basic research and not basic engineering

08:26.399 --> 08:38.897
research. There are certain areas that this 
country is in serious problem, have a serious

08:39.758 --> 08:44.685
problem. And I think if anyone has read the papers 
about our productivity compared to the Japanese

08:45.026 --> 08:55.140
and Europeans, there is some cause for concern. 
And if one looks at where we have serious problems

08:55.373 --> 09:02.961
in this country, we find that we really haven't 
done any research improving productivity. We

09:03.602 --> 09:06.625
really haven't developed better machines. We're 
not competitive in machine tools, and light

09:07.425 --> 09:14.973
equipment, and light appliances, and 
automobiles even. We are competitive in

09:16.475 --> 09:22.461
electronics today.

09:23.183 --> 09:26.186
are competitive internationally in science in a 
few areas. So I blame the National Science

09:27.747 --> 09:40.958
Foundation for some of this, that the science, the 
funding that has gone to engineering schools from

09:27.747 --> 09:40.958
the government has been primarily from the 
National Science Foundation. They've said,

09:40.978 --> 09:45.843
well, you must do fundamental research in fluid 
mechanics or material behavior. But no one has

09:47.564 --> 09:52.228
been funding engineering development. A 
criticism of the National Science Foundation is

09:53.153 --> 10:03.467
not waste, but of directing all of its funds toward 
science research and not engineering research.

10:03.487 --> 10:07.212
And it's sort of come home to haunt us. I think 
that's changing. Hope. Was there any other topic

10:12.299 --> 10:17.946
we need to touch on about runoff questions? No. 
You've got the history. I do recommend you go talk

10:20.409 --> 10:22.452
to Charlie Crawford. He was the department head 
before Dr. Simone. He's still living and still

10:26.831 --> 10:28.934
alert? He's in his 90s. Right. He wrote a history on 
this college. The first 100 years of the College of

10:35.303 --> 10:37.045
Engineering. And so I don't know what you're 
trying to accomplish in this project, whether

10:38.087 --> 10:44.235
it's a history of technology or technology in this 
school.

10:47.179 --> 10:52.827
But he can probably give you a better perspective 
of the changes over the last 50 years than Any

10:53.870 --> 10:58.265
other, well, obviously any other living person, 
both from the college and the department.

11:01.838 --> 11:04.487
OK, I appreciate you taking the time to talk with 
me.
