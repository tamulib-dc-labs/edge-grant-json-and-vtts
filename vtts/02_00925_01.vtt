WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:13.849
We're in the office of the Austin Department of 
Planning and Growth Management, and I'm

00:01.887 --> 00:13.849
interviewing Luther Polnau, P-O-L-N-A-U. And 
Luther is the principal planner with the

00:15.212 --> 00:20.281
department. And Luther, how long have you been 
with this department? this department since it

00:24.584 --> 00:35.373
began in 84 with the city since I was a student at the 
university in 1966. Here in Austin University?

00:39.036 --> 00:39.397
That's right. I see. And what were your studies at 
UT? Architecture and graduate school.

00:51.827 --> 00:54.169
What I'd like to concentrate on First, this 
afternoon, Luther, is the period of transition

00:54.402 --> 01:10.364
between the Austin Tomorrow Plan project and the 
current Austin Plan project and the

00:54.402 --> 01:10.364
reorganization of the planning function in 
Austin. And the last contact we had was with Dick

01:10.384 --> 01:22.401
Lilly prior to any discussions of reorganization 
of the planning functions. And the Austin

01:23.562 --> 01:31.951
Tomorrow Plan had been readied for publication, 
but had not actually been published yet. At the

01:32.612 --> 01:34.354
time that you interviewed Dick? Exactly.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.981
So the plan was published in 1980. Then it must have 
been 79. That's a long period to cover. You can do

01:50.171 --> 01:53.434
it.

01:54.443 --> 01:55.705
Well, let's see. In what way are you interested in 
what the city was doing with planning or what the

01:57.407 --> 02:03.274
department was doing? What the... How the 
reorganization occurred. What led to the

02:11.884 --> 02:14.787
reorganization of the planning department? Who 
initiated that? I think there was probably...

02:21.798 --> 02:42.023
some difficulty in enforcing the Awesome 
Tomorrow Competence Plan and interpreting it and

02:21.798 --> 02:42.023
seeing that it

02:21.798 --> 02:42.023
was very broad and it could be interpreted in very 
many ways. And there were a lot of folks in town who

02:52.493 --> 03:16.476
probably felt that it should not be implemented or 
should not be followed very strictly, that there

02:52.493 --> 03:16.476
should be some other planning procedures that, if 
it were strictly interpreted, I suppose there was

02:52.493 --> 03:16.476
a feeling that it was too restrictive, the growth 
corridor concept in particular. As a matter of

03:16.895 --> 03:43.606
fact, it was not long after the plan was adopted 
that the council approved Motorola's plant out in

03:16.895 --> 03:43.606
the Oak Hill area, a location that was really 
contrary to the desires of the plan. Did the

03:43.666 --> 03:45.248
council adopt the plan? Yes, it was adopted. It was 
adopted, but the plan, as most plans in Texas, are

03:47.322 --> 03:55.759
advisory. This plan was advisory. There's no 
requirement that it be followed. The change, I

04:03.715 --> 04:06.240
suppose, in... the way the department was 
organized came

04:06.659 --> 04:34.793
through both a, I guess, a perception that the

04:06.659 --> 04:34.793
plan wasn't being followed in the private sector, 
probably that it shouldn't be strictly adhered

04:06.659 --> 04:34.793
to, that it was too restrictive, and by the same 
token,

04:35.617 --> 04:57.463
feeling that there

04:35.617 --> 04:57.463
needed to be a change, more authority or more power 
or more attention paid to master planning in terms

04:35.617 --> 04:57.463
of the way the city was organized, the structure of 
the department in particular. And there was a

04:57.483 --> 05:05.353
group that put together a proposal for a new 
planning department. What group was that? It was

05:10.469 --> 05:12.171
called Metro Austin. I think the group is still in 
existence. Is it a citizens group? Yes. Did that

05:17.839 --> 05:27.072
come out of the groups of neighborhood councils 
that had been working as a as a citizens' group with

05:27.507 --> 05:31.032
the Austin Tomorrow Plan project? No, the Metro 
Austin group was only primarily

05:31.052 --> 05:35.098
business-oriented. I see. One of the reasons 
that... The only criticism I had heard of the

05:41.948 --> 05:54.527
Austin Tomorrow report, printed report, was that 
it was a bit vague in the sense that it... didn't

05:55.283 --> 06:07.839
have any map, any diagram of what the adoption of 
policies would lead to in terms of location of

05:55.283 --> 06:07.839
activities. It didn't have a land use plan. It did 
have a map that identified priority development

06:10.783 --> 06:17.832
areas. And

06:17.852 --> 06:22.118
the The high growth area, the growth corridor, as 
it was known, was delineated on a map. And that in

06:31.229 --> 06:41.800
itself was a bit of a problem for

06:31.229 --> 06:41.800
people to follow and to enforce. One of the, as I 
understand it, one of the city councilmen

06:42.060 --> 06:52.932
requested directly through the city manager at 
that time that a planned diagram be formulated

06:53.333 --> 06:58.420
that the council could receive and act on. Are you 
aware of anything like that? What do you mean, a

07:00.302 --> 07:01.864
plan diagram? A plan, a land use element for the 
plan

07:01.944 --> 07:10.695
drawn. I don't recall. I don't recall that. Okay. 
I'd heard that, and I didn't know what the status of

07:11.737 --> 07:16.242
that was. It

07:16.262 --> 07:21.749
was secondhand information for me. Not that I'm 
aware of. If

07:23.236 --> 07:43.607
you look at it from this reorganization, the 
restructuring of the planning

07:23.236 --> 07:43.607
department from an internal perspective, it 
seemed that The folks that were involved with

07:44.954 --> 07:56.532
comprehensive planning were more involved in 
supporting the zoning and subdivision planners.

07:56.652 --> 07:58.137
Once the plan was adopted, Austin was on sort of a 
growth spurt that began probably in the late 70s,

07:59.095 --> 08:27.297
really picked up the rate of growth at three and 
three and a half percent in the late 70s and began to

07:59.095 --> 08:27.297
pick up to the point where by some people's account 
in 84 and 85 was double digit annual growth rate.

08:28.137 --> 08:42.174
That sort of spurt in development with a staff that 
was smaller instead of larger resulted in

08:28.137 --> 08:42.174
comprehensive planning section. The folks that 
were supposed to be watching out for the master

08:42.615 --> 08:52.807
plan really to be served more as support for 
special studies for zoning and subdivision

08:42.615 --> 08:52.807
activity. And one of the goals of the 
reorganization was to sort of get comprehensive

08:55.846 --> 09:07.977
planning back on track and give it some 
importance. Restructuring the departments was

09:08.037 --> 09:25.853
to have the planning and growth management 
department perform that function as a separate

09:08.037 --> 09:25.853
department

09:08.037 --> 09:25.853
so that it would not be sucked into the day-to-day 
planning activities. It's all too easy to do.

09:27.945 --> 09:28.148
Yeah. And organizationally, the department was 
to report directly to the manager. And

09:34.259 --> 09:57.966
theoretically, at least at the time that it was 
being structured, the thought was that that sort

09:34.259 --> 09:57.966
of reporting structure would give the department 
a bit of an edge over other departments in terms of

09:34.259 --> 09:57.966
its role in coordinating the activities so that 
there would be some coordination and mutual

09:34.259 --> 09:57.966
supporting. Where do the other departments 
report? The way it's actually working there are

10:01.757 --> 10:12.028
assistant city managers that each of the 
departments report to. So they certainly would

10:12.048 --> 10:16.132
put planning then in a more or less coordinated 
role. Theoretically. Potentially. Yeah. But as

10:21.438 --> 10:25.742
it actually happened, I think planning is just 
another, or planning and growth management is

10:26.431 --> 10:38.613
another one of the departments that reports 
directly to an assistant city

10:26.431 --> 10:38.613
manager. So the reorganization, at least 
ostensibly, was

10:38.633 --> 10:48.230
to do that. Okay. What is the size of your staff now 
in this particular department? Must be around 45.

10:59.874 --> 11:06.563
Of

10:59.874 --> 11:06.563
those, how many would you say were planners? The 
other division is primarily the computer folks,

11:06.583 --> 11:16.296
the land-based information system that's being 
developed. Probably about...

11:19.925 --> 11:40.811
12

11:19.925 --> 11:40.811
folks over there, 13 folks, and we probably have 
20, 20 times. That's about right. You have to look

11:41.291 --> 11:42.673
at an organization chart to see exactly what it is. 
Yeah.

11:49.878 --> 12:08.075
Can you describe the general approach taken and 
the organization that is available now for the

11:49.878 --> 12:08.075
Austin Plan project and how this might differ from 
the Austin Tomorrow work that was done under Dick

11:49.878 --> 12:08.075
Lilly's administration?

12:09.776 --> 12:17.083
The major difference is that the Austin Plan is...

12:20.219 --> 12:50.091
enforceable not too long after the department was 
reorganized got some new folks in from Florida

12:20.219 --> 12:50.091
Florida is one of the states that has mandatory 
planning required compliance as part of the state

12:20.219 --> 12:50.091
law and Texas of course doesn't have that but as 
home rule cities go home rule charters are fairly

12:50.071 --> 13:19.251
And

12:50.071 --> 13:19.251
shortly after the reorganization and bringing on 
board these folks, there was a charter election

12:50.071 --> 13:19.251
amendment to the charter that required the 
adoption of a comprehensive plan, specified the

12:50.071 --> 13:19.251
elements that are in that comprehensive plan, and 
required compliance of all the city's action to

12:50.071 --> 13:19.251
the comprehensive plan. What that really means is 
that... We'll make sure to see what happens, but

13:20.075 --> 13:41.225
what it means is that the council, or anyone else 
for that matter, will have to... All the actions

13:20.075 --> 13:41.225
that the city takes will have to be in conformance 
with the comprehensive plan. What if the council

13:42.086 --> 13:46.352
does what they did before with Motorola?

13:48.678 --> 14:01.750
I suppose as any charter amendment or charter 
violation,

13:48.678 --> 14:01.750
I suppose a citizen can take the city to court or 
whatever. I suppose that's the way charter

14:01.770 --> 14:05.093
violations are dealt with. I would suspect that 
that would be the case. But I think

14:09.777 --> 14:16.103
the situation here is that There has to be a certain 
amount of flexibility, and I think what we look at

14:17.467 --> 14:22.785
in terms of what's going to happen here is the 
comprehensive plan will allow some sort of

14:23.609 --> 14:48.966
predictability and consistency in action, but 
the plan can be amended, and it's intended that

14:23.609 --> 14:48.966
there would be amendments so that we get, before 
there is an action taken that is contrary to the

14:23.609 --> 14:48.966
comprehensive plan, discussion about amendment 
and its overall effect will occur. And it has a

14:49.126 --> 14:53.312
couple advantages in that sense, in that... Yes. 
If the city is faced with a decision about a

14:56.515 --> 15:14.701
particular issue, the decision regarding that 
issue, if it involves a plan amendment, will

14:56.515 --> 15:14.701
require a more comprehensive view of the impact of 
that particular issue or decision. And it will be

15:15.222 --> 15:25.476
less subject, I think, ideally, to the sort of 
incremental, narrow decisions that, at least

15:15.222 --> 15:25.476
ideally, occurred in the past. Well, that would 
mean then that the city, if, for example,

15:27.138 --> 15:50.993
something like a Motorola situation presented 
itself to the city in the future, then the city, if

15:27.138 --> 15:50.993
it were in conflict with the adopted plan, then the 
city would have to go through the hearing process

15:27.138 --> 15:50.993
for revising the plan, which would bring it before 
the public for discussion and so forth. And then

15:51.013 --> 15:54.298
after readopting the plan in a new form, they'd 
have to revise the zoning ordinance to

15:54.667 --> 16:18.852
accommodate uh the changes in the comprehensive 
plan right the other the other thing key to that is

15:54.667 --> 16:18.852
not only

15:54.667 --> 16:18.852
well i started to say not only are we going to have to 
amend the master plan and go through that public

15:54.667 --> 16:18.852
hearing process and see things in context but uh 
interpretation of whether or not an issue or

16:19.760 --> 16:33.919
decision is in conformance with the plan is going 
to be a little bit more easy than it would have been

16:19.760 --> 16:33.919
with the old Austin Tomorrow Plan. That plan was, 
as you mentioned before, very general. There were

16:39.366 --> 16:44.333
some internal conflicts in it so that you could 
almost come up with any position on an issue and

16:44.937 --> 16:50.455
find some statement in the plan that would support 
that position. This plan, we're hoping, will have

16:52.140 --> 16:57.377
a little less less broad dictates in it. It will 
have a certain direction. Yeah, there will be a

17:04.445 --> 17:09.553
land use element and a land use map, for instance. 
And transportation? It'll have all the classic

17:11.877 --> 17:13.821
components. Public facilities. Right. That's 
very interesting to me as a kind of a

17:17.447 --> 17:24.158
traditionalist in planning. We needn't go into 
that. I'm not here to interview myself. But that's

17:28.628 --> 17:52.609
quite a departure, because when I talked with Dick 
Lilly about this at conferences and when he was a

17:28.628 --> 17:52.609
guest at A&M in our department, I asked him why it 
was that the Austin Tomorrow Project seemed to be

17:28.628 --> 17:52.609
heading toward a policies document. rather than a 
comprehensive plan. And he said, well, he wasn't

17:56.159 --> 18:03.468
sure that the staff could put together a 
comprehensive plan. And I thought he was kidding,

18:03.488 --> 18:06.772
frankly. But I'm not so sure. It was to know. And 
we'll have to see now what comes out of this new

18:10.276 --> 18:17.124
project, because I would wonder about that 
statement. I think that the staff here is quite

18:17.144 --> 18:22.090
capable of putting together a comprehensive 
plan. Yeah, I would think so too, probably.

18:28.677 --> 18:32.846
But at that time, of course, policy plans were very 
fashionable then. Everybody had to have a policy

18:32.866 --> 18:34.609
plan. If you didn't have a policy plan, you weren't 
on the cutting edge of planning. Yeah, that's

18:38.757 --> 18:41.783
where the limelight... Yes, and it was almost sort 
of a plan for planners in a sense, because that's

18:42.488 --> 18:53.292
what you come out with. If there is any glory in 
planning, that's what planners are looking for,

18:53.710 --> 19:03.706
the glory or sort of innovative approaches. I 
think there is a cost to that sort of thing that you

19:03.726 --> 19:20.173
take for granted the very basics, the foundation 
of planning, and try to get to something better,

19:03.726 --> 19:20.173
something...

19:20.896 --> 19:49.958
something

19:20.896 --> 19:49.958
perhaps

19:20.896 --> 19:49.958
more exciting or something broader or whatever, 
you lose the very basic requirements of

19:20.896 --> 19:49.958
coordinating facilities, of making sure the 
various arms of the city are working in concert,

19:20.896 --> 19:49.958
and that it does do the things that it's supposed to 
for the private sector and for the public sector.

19:51.271 --> 19:58.200
that we may be on sort of a pendulum and be going back 
to that too far. I don't know, but I think it was

19:58.340 --> 20:03.867
missing in the past, in the recent past. It was 
interesting because the same thing happened in

20:05.068 --> 20:08.593
Oakland, California. They were putting together 
a document that had a long list of goals,

20:09.514 --> 20:18.325
objectives, and policies, but no planned 
diagrams. for either circulation or land use or

20:19.216 --> 20:23.662
public utilities. And they were directed by the 
city council to complete their work and to

20:23.682 --> 20:37.020
indicate what the consequences would be 
geographically of adopting that set of goals,

20:23.682 --> 20:37.020
objectives, and policies. So they had to go back to 
the drafting board again to do that. And here, that

20:42.226 --> 20:44.489
didn't happen. What did happen, it seems to me, and 
correct me if I'm wrong, It meant that the whole

20:48.224 --> 21:12.628
department was reorganized and that, as you 
pointed out, it was reorganized essentially to

20:48.224 --> 21:12.628
clarify the essential differences between 
current planning on a day-to-day basis and

20:48.224 --> 21:12.628
long-range comprehensive planning so that 
long-range comprehensive planning wouldn't be

20:48.224 --> 21:12.628
drained a way to do the day-to-day tasks that 
should be handled elsewhere. That's the

21:18.037 --> 21:20.421
reorganization. The reorganization also was 
sort of a vehicle, a tool, for doing a new

21:20.481 --> 21:28.553
comprehensive plan, which was needed also. 
Because we had a comprehensive plan and We did not

21:36.352 --> 21:39.195
implement it. We had several failed bond 
elections that resulted in our not being able to

21:39.255 --> 21:49.906
extend utilities in the areas that were called for 
in the comprehensive plan. Private developers,

21:51.067 --> 22:06.223
there was a period of several years in the early 80s 
where the utilities that were extended were

21:51.067 --> 22:06.223
extended through our municipal utility 
districts.

22:06.608 --> 22:14.861
The districts were created wherever the land 
could be had regardless of where the

22:06.608 --> 22:14.861
comprehensive plan called for development to 
occur. By the time 8384 came about, we found

22:16.463 --> 22:33.409
ourselves having more development commitments 
without any regard to the comprehensive plan

22:16.463 --> 22:33.409
development commitments on the part of the 
private sector. on the part of the city and having

22:33.389 --> 22:38.919
to respond to where the need was. And we were in a 
situation where we had a comprehensive plan that

22:41.203 --> 22:56.089
was totally contrary to what was going on, what had 
occurred. the need for the city to respond and take

22:56.525 --> 23:01.930
stock of itself. I know that Lily was very upset 
about the proliferation of muds and what that was

23:02.510 --> 23:11.659
doing to frustrate the plan. And then shortly 
after he commented on this at some APA meetings,

23:14.081 --> 23:26.532
Kent Butler published his paper in the Implanting 
Magazine.

23:26.782 --> 23:35.033
which was quite a good paper, I thought. Yeah, it 
was a strange time because we found the city was

23:35.053 --> 23:50.314
growing by leaps and bounds, population 
development, but the city itself was not able to

23:35.053 --> 23:50.314
respond because of the failed bond elections. The 
private sector found a way to do it, and in finding a

23:50.334 --> 23:56.282
way to do it, not only made things in a way simpler 
for them, they didn't have to comply with the

23:57.342 --> 24:21.122
comprehensive plan, practically speaking, but 
they also, through MUDS, there's sort of a market

23:57.342 --> 24:21.122
advantage because of the financial, the 
financing advantages to the developer and MUDS.

24:22.030 --> 24:30.943
It was a necessity at first to put together MUDS, 
and it became a desirable way to develop later on.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.890
They could take an end run around the city that way. 
Essentially.

24:39.496 --> 24:45.304
But, I

24:39.496 --> 24:45.304
don't know, the city... The city began to use the 
contractual agreements with the MUDs to get some

24:46.212 --> 25:04.711
concessions out of the private sector in terms of 
specific land use requirements, public

24:46.212 --> 25:04.711
facilities that were donated, that sort of thing. 
So gradually, there began to be a trade-off also.

25:10.377 --> 25:14.481
And I think development standards for streets I 
think we got some pretty good deals out of that.

25:25.004 --> 25:40.502
Okay, now that that phase is over and you're into a 
new phase of planning for Austin, and this, by the

25:25.004 --> 25:40.502
way, is one of many comprehensive plans that have 
been prepared for Austin, starting with, I think,

25:41.292 --> 25:46.720
the first one done by Hal Wise right after the 
Second World War. Well, 1928 was actually the

25:48.342 --> 25:51.727
first one. Kockenfeller. Kockenfeller in 1928. I 
wonder if there are any copies of that document

25:56.053 --> 26:01.801
that one could photocopy or refer to. There 
probably are in the Austin Travis County

26:02.842 --> 26:08.971
Collection in the History Center. They won't let 
me into the stacks. to do research. I have to go

26:13.581 --> 26:16.059
through the current catalog. Let me just... I was 
starting to say that there seemed to be a very

26:19.430 --> 26:48.610
strong position on the part of the business and 
development community, because Austin was

26:19.430 --> 26:48.610
growing such leaps and bounds, that the Austin 
Tomorrow comprehensive plan was stifling, was no

26:19.430 --> 26:48.610
growth sort of plan,

26:19.430 --> 26:48.610
and there was a strong move to

26:50.986 --> 26:54.810
have another plan or to growth corridors. Some of 
the terms that were used in the Austin Tomorrow

26:54.870 --> 27:00.675
Plan were dirty words. And there was a strong 
feeling that we needed to have another plan or not

27:02.957 --> 27:14.948
use that plan. There was a push to have a land use map 
or land use element developed as part of an

27:19.336 --> 27:26.965
amendment to the Austin Tomorrow Plan. Some way to 
get out of what at least a fairly large segment of

27:29.188 --> 27:42.964
the community, the business community anyway, 
felt was too confining a growth border concept.

27:43.417 --> 27:51.484
unrealistic, no growth concept at the time that 
Austin was growing so fast. And this was largely by

27:51.504 --> 27:54.868
the business community? Yes.

27:58.211 --> 28:03.335
Business, developers, builders, that 
growth-related community. So as a consequence

28:03.355 --> 28:11.483
now, the new approach to the Austin Plan, I gather, 
has acknowledged those feelings on the part of the

28:11.767 --> 28:37.774
community, business community and others, and 
has moved ahead with what I would term a classical

28:11.767 --> 28:37.774
approach toward a comprehensive plan, namely a 
plan that's composed of three essential elements

28:11.767 --> 28:37.774
of land use, transportation, and public 
facilities. more elements in that. There are 10 or

28:40.450 --> 28:45.660
12 elements, but it is of that ilk, yes.

28:48.926 --> 28:52.894
And I think the notion here is One that is not so 
rigid in terms of defining a growth border, an area

28:54.241 --> 29:14.697
where we should grow in terms of a guiding concept

28:54.241 --> 29:14.697
of a plan, but of a land use element that 
coordinates the basic utility services and roads

28:54.241 --> 29:14.697
and that sort of thing. The environmental 
constraints that were paramount in the Austin

29:15.082 --> 29:41.798
Tomorrow Plan are certainly recognized in this 
plan, but I think

29:15.082 --> 29:41.798
there's probably a broader recognition of 
engineering or design mitigation to deal with the

29:15.082 --> 29:41.798
environmental concerns, and not so much of what 
was perceived at the time no development outside

29:42.098 --> 29:45.242
the growth corridor. And although that was not the 
intent or the way the plan was to work, that's the

29:45.342 --> 29:52.712
popular interpretation of it. You had definite no 
development zones. That was the perception that

29:55.175 --> 29:58.359
the public had. That's the perception. That's not 
what the plan called for, but got a dirty name

30:00.782 --> 30:08.572
because of that. OK.

30:13.688 --> 30:15.592
I'll ask Norman about timing. But I wanted to ask 
you what other elements are considered for the

30:16.615 --> 30:29.284
awesome plan project now, in addition to the three 
basics?

30:31.120 --> 30:34.925
OK, you mentioned the transportation, land use, 
public facilities. There's public services

30:35.165 --> 30:41.573
also, and public buildings as well. Environment, 
economics, economic development, housing,

30:41.593 --> 30:52.167
health and social services.

30:54.593 --> 30:58.056
cultural affairs, urban design. I'm sure I left 
out one or two, but well, OK. Question on your

31:04.283 --> 31:07.626
transportation element. Austin has been going 
through the agonies of debate over its airport for

31:08.447 --> 31:17.796
about 20 years to my knowledge. And before that, I 
don't know. Is the Austin plan going to solve that

31:21.340 --> 31:24.583
problem?

31:29.660 --> 31:30.301
I doubt it. There's an airport commission that's 
seated right now, and I think you may have to ask

31:32.724 --> 31:59.599
Norm how this goes, but my perception of what would 
happen with this is that there are probably some

31:32.724 --> 31:59.599
key

31:32.724 --> 31:59.599
players, key...

32:02.212 --> 32:17.487
factors involved that would be dealt with by the 
airport commission city council participants in

32:02.212 --> 32:17.487
the transportation as well as the land use 
component of this plan that all be involved

32:02.212 --> 32:17.487
together But

32:18.074 --> 32:39.927
I think the airport issue is a political issue. 
It's not necessarily a planning issue. I think

32:40.728 --> 32:44.674
there have been plenty of reports that say the area 
that it's in right now is such that it can't

32:40.728 --> 32:44.674
reasonably be expanded without paying a hell of a 
price on existing housing and development. If you

32:44.694 --> 32:46.236
look at it from that position, I think it needs to be 
moved somewhere. But that's an opinion. On

32:47.386 --> 33:02.506
circulation, the officials at Texas A&M from the 
top on down are very concerned about the lack of

32:47.386 --> 33:02.506
good highway facilities between College Station 
and Austin. And they are working very closely with

33:04.108 --> 33:16.684
the State Division of Highways and 
Transportation to upgrade circulation between

33:04.108 --> 33:16.684
the two, largely because of the two universities. 
are you going to be proposing in the Austin plan for

33:17.542 --> 33:30.617
any new major links between College Station and 
Austin? For example, particularly, let me point

33:30.637 --> 33:44.292
out that the only two ways in and out of Austin now 
from the east are going either north to the north

33:30.637 --> 33:44.292
end of the city or the south end of the city. There's 
nothing that goes right into the middle of the city

33:44.677 --> 33:48.223
that I'm aware of. Not as a major road. Those are the 
only two state highways that exist throughout

33:52.990 --> 33:58.979
Dallas. Any of the others are just county roads. 
I'm not aware of anything. We have, I suppose,

34:04.027 --> 34:12.721
Austin Transportation Study.

34:12.741 --> 34:12.861
And... The major

34:13.415 --> 34:31.064
interest right now, I think, is north-south, and 
most recently an alternative to I-35 to San

34:13.415 --> 34:31.064
Antonio.

34:31.084 --> 34:34.569
You're at capacity now on 35, aren't you? Yes, 
there's talk about double-decking beyond what we

34:34.589 --> 34:39.237
already have. Double-decking the 
double-decker? No, extending the double-deck.

34:44.148 --> 34:44.728
Extending it. Yes, on the way out to Bend White in 
the south.

34:51.716 --> 34:55.000
They're in the process now of widening the 
northern portion.

35:01.828 --> 35:06.473
Okay, is there anything else you'd like to comment 
on? with regard to the project.

35:13.585 --> 35:15.387
No? OK. I can't think of anything. Thank you very 
much. OK.

35:18.110 --> 35:23.215
Good afternoon. This is the 21st of November, 
1986. We're in the office of Norman Standoffer,

35:26.939 --> 35:32.005
the planning director. for the Department of 
Planning and Growth Management of the city of

35:33.487 --> 35:37.914
Austin. And Norman, I'd like to start out by asking 
you, what were the influences on your life as a

35:38.875 --> 35:52.495
planner that brought you from Florida, where you 
were, to Austin, Texas?

35:59.506 --> 36:01.789
I'm dying of smoking.

36:03.862 --> 36:14.968
I guess at the time I considered coming to Austin,

36:03.862 --> 36:14.968
I was extremely skeptical of coming back to this 
part of the world. because I didn't really believe

36:15.168 --> 36:19.294
there was much to be done for planting in the 
Southwest. You say coming back, you were here...

36:19.495 --> 36:28.309
Well, I wasn't in Texas, but I was in Oklahoma for a 
good deal of my career before I went to Florida. I

36:28.329 --> 36:31.393
equate the great Southwest as the desert for 
planting. I always did during my career because it

36:32.255 --> 36:36.341
just wasn't part of the mandatory planting 
movement. It

36:36.361 --> 36:43.352
wasn't much innovative, in my opinion, 
professionally happening. at least not what I was

36:43.703 --> 36:46.145
looking for. I felt my career and my view of 
planning

36:46.826 --> 37:00.560
really matured after spending nearly 10, 12 years 
in Oklahoma. Where were you in Oklahoma? I was in

37:01.741 --> 37:05.085
Oklahoma City, basically, in central Oklahoma. I 
went to the university, got my master's degree,

37:05.105 --> 37:12.192
came out of school in the mid-60s. Weren't a lot of 
planners around in those days in Oklahoma. Became

37:16.835 --> 37:25.208
a planning director as my first job in a little 
suburban community of Central Oklahoma, Midwest

37:16.835 --> 37:25.208
City. And as many people did in those days, you ran a 
one-man, you know, planning and zoning shop. And

37:32.199 --> 37:40.052
basically stayed around Central Oklahoma, moved 
to Oklahoma City as assistant director and

37:32.199 --> 37:40.052
eventually as director.

37:42.091 --> 37:48.302
I finally got to the midlife crisis of the early 40s 
and tried to figure out what I was going to do with my

37:42.091 --> 37:48.302
life. I had accomplished significant things I 
thought were mine in Oklahoma City and was at the

37:48.763 --> 37:58.460
crossroads of what I wanted to do with my life. And I 
started my own consulting firm.

38:06.661 --> 38:16.250
Got into rehabilitation of old Victorian homes 
and that kind of thing, thinking I was going to find

38:06.661 --> 38:16.250
a solution to renovation of the inner city by 
myself. In Oklahoma City. Yeah. Went through the

38:18.853 --> 38:26.180
epic problems of the first time interest rates 
went from 10% to 14%, and that ended that venture.

38:29.283 --> 38:35.149
Went to South Florida and really learned what 
planning was all about. I spent nearly five years

38:36.901 --> 38:48.117
in Broward County, Florida, which is well 
documented as one of the fastest growth urban

38:36.901 --> 38:48.117
areas in the United States. It grew from 85,000 
people in 1950 to over a million in 1980. And it was

38:57.190 --> 39:00.195
just a phenomenal urban laboratory.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.963
It was a very innovative place to do planning. in 
terms of it was the first governmental unit in the

39:06.314 --> 39:17.670
state of Florida to adopt in its charter, 
interestingly enough, a mandatory planning

39:06.314 --> 39:17.670
charter. It came out of a grassroots charter 
movement of the people of the area and followed two

39:17.710 --> 39:31.410
years later by the Florida Mandatory Planning 
Act.

39:32.217 --> 39:34.680
It was a unique kind of intergovernmental system. 
It wasn't like Metro Dade or Nashville Davidson in

39:34.720 --> 39:48.299
its charter, but it was metropolitan in its 
planning and regulation, but not in other service

39:34.720 --> 39:48.299
provisions of government. It was a good start. 
Yeah, and it was a very interesting challenge. I

39:52.385 --> 39:55.550
got to Broward at the time the plan had been 
completed. Was that an in-house job? No, they had

39:58.964 --> 40:02.608
used consultants, but largely in-house. And they 
had been wrestling for a couple of years over the

40:03.929 --> 40:15.982
implementation and regulatory streamlining 
part of making it function. And I got the job of

40:16.002 --> 40:24.611
writing the Broward County Land Development 
Code, which was the tool and the vehicle that

40:16.002 --> 40:24.611
implemented the plan. And that thing That 
process, that entity, and the resulting

40:27.449 --> 40:41.507
litigations that came about with some of our 
innovations and impact fees and things like that

40:27.449 --> 40:41.507
were just, to me, were the top of my professional 
career. And I was at the point, having put that to

40:41.908 --> 40:56.106
bed and had it working real well, Jim Duncan 
sitting there as one of my principal deputies

40:41.908 --> 40:56.106
running the thing, it just worked like a dream and 
There wasn't any more challenge. And all of a

41:00.344 --> 41:02.266
sudden, we were up at the conference. I can't 
remember where the conference was. Northeast

41:06.029 --> 41:12.115
somewhere, when we saw and heard the rumblings 
about the... Austin? Austin, and everybody

41:12.135 --> 41:17.540
started figuring out what was going on in Austin. 
Jim Duncan had told me about Austin all his life

41:17.580 --> 41:23.665
because Jim had been from here originally. Went to 
UT, worked here as a planning intern, that kind of

41:23.685 --> 41:26.768
thing. They said all his life, if he ever got the 
opportunity, there's only one place he'd want to

41:27.203 --> 41:35.712
settle, and that's Austin, Texas. And he got real 
interested, because at the same time they

41:35.732 --> 41:42.159
advertised his job that he took, they advertised 
this job. They broke Dick's department into two

41:42.179 --> 41:44.722
departments. And it was just so phenomenal that 
the two job ads were tailor-made. He's regulatory

41:52.381 --> 41:56.107
day to day zoning nuts and bolts. That's his forte, 
planning and automation, which were the the

41:56.989 --> 42:06.905
issues that they were building around this 
department and what we've done here were my forte.

42:06.945 --> 42:18.625
It was just, you know, it's like, we're the people 
so we applied I was a little less skeptical of it

42:06.945 --> 42:18.625
because I was my ingrained attitudes about 
Leaving a mandatory planning state, a state where

42:19.837 --> 42:29.188
the legislation, the litigation, and the 
momentum for planning were so perfect. I just

42:29.508 --> 42:31.991
consider that the greatest planning environment 
in the world. But I was 45-plus years old. I felt I

42:37.918 --> 42:39.760
had capped my career. And I said, the only other 
thing I want to do in the public sector is make it

42:39.900 --> 42:46.047
work in a non-mandatory planning state. Well, 
when we came through the interview process down

42:47.933 --> 43:01.959
here with the city manager, they were really 
talking about the possibilities of stretching

42:47.933 --> 43:01.959
the limits with Austin. And we learned about the 
problems of Austin and the polarities and the

43:02.039 --> 43:10.414
pro-growth, no-growth and the dramatic problems 
they were having here. But the interest in the then

43:11.356 --> 43:18.084
city council and the manager in perhaps trying to 
do something through our Home Rule Charter. Who

43:18.204 --> 43:19.706
was the city manager then? It was Jorge Carrasco, 
the current city manager. He was, I see. He had just

43:23.991 --> 43:28.676
been appointed six or eight months before that. 
And who was the manager before him? That was when

43:31.980 --> 43:34.883
Dick Ernie was here.

43:38.339 --> 43:40.261
Gosh, it slips my mind. Wasn't Dan Davidson 
another fellow right after that? Well, there was

43:43.024 --> 43:45.687
somebody between Davidson and Carrasco. Yes. I 
can't recall his name.

43:51.654 --> 44:01.825
But knowing the strong home rule power of Texas 
City, well, there's always that possibility that

43:51.654 --> 44:01.825
you can set a mandatory context in our home rule 
charter. I've talked with my friends and peers

44:03.286 --> 44:08.312
back here for years. APA chapter wants to go get the 
state legislature to do something about the

44:09.237 --> 44:14.542
Planning Act. And I said, yeah, forget it. Do it in 
your own charter. Do it at home. If you can't do it at

44:19.127 --> 44:21.770
home, don't expect the legislature to do it for 
you. You've got all the power of home rule

44:21.790 --> 44:29.037
authority to do it just like it happened in 
Florida. And don't worry about it. Don't wait for

44:29.978 --> 44:37.506
the state legislature, rural dominated, real 
estate dominated, bank dominated, to give you

44:29.978 --> 44:37.506
planning mandates. Our manager and our counsel 
said, we'll think about doing that. Well, that

44:42.232 --> 44:51.905
convinced me if I'm going to do one more stint in the 
public sector, what better way than to pull it off

44:42.232 --> 44:51.905
in the middle of Texas. And that was kind of the 
challenge. Okay, that's very interesting that

44:55.310 --> 44:59.035
that challenge, and then of course it worked out. 
The question is open until we finish. When you were

45:04.563 --> 45:07.847
in Florida... Did you know Dan O'Connell? Oh, yes. 
Well, Dan and I are pretty good friends. Oh. And we

45:16.483 --> 45:26.113
knew each other when he, first of all, had wondered 
if he would pursue a PhD at Texas A&M or University

45:16.483 --> 45:26.113
of Washington. Right. Well, you know what 
happened with the situation at University of

45:27.254 --> 45:35.623
Washington, and I, of course, had known him up 
there, too, and I could tell he was getting

45:27.254 --> 45:35.623
disenchanted. And then we kept in correspondence 
after he returned to Florida. And I guess he's

45:41.212 --> 45:43.315
still in the governor's office. Yeah, should be 
figuring out what he's doing himself since the

45:43.335 --> 45:47.902
governor's going to the Senate. I've been meaning 
to try to call him and find out what's going on. We

45:50.786 --> 45:53.330
keep in contact every three or four months. He's a 
very good man. If you talk to him before I do, say

45:55.714 --> 46:00.080
hello. He sure is. He's very inventive and got lots 
of energy. As a matter of fact, we got Dan in here.

46:05.658 --> 46:06.759
That's right. He mentioned he was coming. I got 
here in September. Duncan got here in August. We

46:10.324 --> 46:15.451
were faced with this big Northwest plan fiasco 
here. And in the process of doing that plan, we were

46:15.471 --> 46:26.465
also working behind the scenes with the council, 
who said, all right, take a shot at giving us a

46:15.471 --> 46:26.465
mandatory charter. And we got Dan O'Connell in 
here as a consultant. to do a big report, give them

46:30.515 --> 46:37.206
the legislative legal bases for doing these kinds 
of things, and to draft our charter. And we did that
