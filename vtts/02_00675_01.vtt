00:01.702 --> 00:11.572
the College of Education, who has been at Texas A&M 
since 1970,

00:01.702 --> 00:11.572
shortly after the college was formed. And Dean 
Cole is going to share with me, I hope, some ideas,

00:12.353 --> 00:26.367
some insights, some perceptions of all of the 
things that have happened and all of the changes,

00:12.353 --> 00:26.367
or at least some of them, but basically changes. 
And that's one of the things I'm focusing on and on

00:26.607 --> 00:30.291
the different administrations. I have a lot of 
questions now after 653 organizational behavior

00:30.592 --> 00:38.844
course about the structure of the organization. I 
realize that I'm just somebody peeking in the

00:38.904 --> 00:50.882
windows, and I don't have the whole picture 
because I'm not intimately involved except in the

00:38.904 --> 00:50.882
different roles that I've been involved. So there 
are some questions, and I'll deal with those maybe

00:50.902 --> 00:59.755
later and ask you about

00:50.902 --> 00:59.755
leadership styles or conflict management even 
just the management in general. But I know you're

01:02.192 --> 01:03.954
very intimately aware. But anyway, basically, 
you've seen the questions and you know what I'm

01:03.974 --> 01:16.972
doing and why I'm doing it and the fact that I'm 
really looking for something other than a true

01:03.974 --> 01:16.972
history. I'm really wanting to find how people are 
feeling and what kinds of things. And you have been

01:22.339 --> 01:27.666
in a unique situation because you worked so 
closely with Dean Hubert and you have worked

01:28.355 --> 01:35.882
equally as hard as Dean Corrigan, and you're 
there, and you're heavy into the

01:28.355 --> 01:35.882
decision-making. So shall we talk about changes 
first, Major? Write a book, do you realize that?

01:42.768 --> 01:43.369
Why don't you? In your spare time? I've just spent 
the last three weeks trying to put one little bitty

01:46.152 --> 01:52.578
paper together that I'm presenting next week. 
It's been an incredible amount of time. What's it

01:54.740 --> 01:55.240
on? its own improved decision-making, as a matter 
of fact. Good. Will you share anything? Sure. It

02:04.639 --> 02:09.587
really is an outgrowth out of the... Actually, 
what it is is 639, all in one paper. Wonderful. It's

02:10.929 --> 02:11.870
a great course. It's still one of the best. It's 
what I have finally gotten to do, exactly what I

02:13.012 --> 02:19.041
asked you guys to do. That's great. I sure hope 
you'll get through.

02:26.101 --> 02:27.143
Well, all right. We started when the college 
opened in 1969. It had evolved, you know, from the

02:29.746 --> 02:34.273
Department of Education. But women was, 
everybody's talking about the big change, the

02:34.393 --> 02:38.940
impact of women in the college, okay? The focus and 
the mission of the college has been and will be and

02:41.303 --> 02:47.232
always had the teaching, the research, and the and 
the service, maybe let's start with that. With how

02:50.108 --> 03:04.042
has that, or has that changed in focus, or has the 
focus of those, of that mission changed in any way

02:50.108 --> 03:04.042
between the Pubert era and the Corrigan era, for 
example?

03:04.082 --> 03:13.371
The big difference between the early years, early 
70s, and where we are today, is that we had a very

03:14.363 --> 03:18.728
young faculty.

03:18.949 --> 03:24.215
Just beginning, we had a few folks who were fairly 
well established. But we had really come in

03:24.235 --> 03:34.348
primarily as teachers, graduate level as well as 
graduate level. And we were very immature. And I

03:36.330 --> 03:37.812
don't mean that in a negative sense. I mean in terms 
of development. We were very immature during that

03:39.955 --> 03:43.459
time. And as we went through the early 70s, about 
73, 74, when the big growth spokes began to hit,

03:44.992 --> 04:09.246
through the late 70s, about a five-year span of 73 
to 78, we were increasing in the college anywhere

03:44.992 --> 04:09.246
from 11% to 14% a year for five years steadily. We 
were the fastest growing college of education in

04:09.526 --> 04:13.952
the country as far as we know. during that period of 
time. We were going against national trends. As a

04:22.559 --> 04:24.902
general rule, enrollment teacher education was 
going down. Graduate enrollment was a slow growth

04:25.623 --> 04:28.127
pattern. Undergraduate was phenomenal. There 
was one year in the era that finances were good,

04:30.390 --> 04:41.466
growth and everything else, that we added 10 new 
positions in the college in one year. And that's 10

04:41.486 --> 04:43.669
tenure track positions. Now, that hasn't 
happened before or since. But there were a number

04:48.560 --> 04:52.345
of years now where we had four to six new positions. 
So during that mid-'70s period, it grew very

04:52.365 --> 04:57.612
rapidly. And I think it's really a tribute to Dr. 
Hubert and to Dr. Corbin, both. That first Dr.

05:04.782 --> 05:13.875
Hubert, from the standpoint of moving that 
quickly, plus with the institution itself, is

05:04.782 --> 05:13.875
changing very dramatically at that time. that we 
were able to maintain and, in fact,

05:14.513 --> 05:28.006
have a cohesive goal toward which we were all 
trying to move. We've gone from that immaturity of

05:28.026 --> 05:43.440
people really focusing on what I would perceive as 
a more common goal to whereas now, where we have a

05:28.026 --> 05:43.440
common goal, we also have a large number of faculty 
that that in a major college like we have here, you

05:43.724 --> 05:50.751
have to have both kinds of folks. But at the same 
time, each has to recognize the worth and the value

05:50.771 --> 05:57.618
of both kinds. An undergraduate program with 
2,500 students and that your bread and butter is

05:57.638 --> 06:07.909
teacher education and put all your apples in the 
research basket. Similarly, you can't have a

06:08.990 --> 06:13.495
graduate program with a thousand kids and put all 
your apples You've got to have a balanced program

06:14.082 --> 06:24.847
and that's sometimes very difficult to maintain. 
There are a lot of forces working both from that

06:25.007 --> 06:32.344
university and from within the university more 
toward the graduate area of exclusion. Well, not

06:38.155 --> 06:43.300
exclusion, but the graduate program first 
priority or maybe even second priority. And I

06:43.380 --> 06:58.636
don't know that we need to say one is first and one is 
second, but rather recognize that they're both

06:43.380 --> 06:58.636
very important missions of the college and 
recognize that both these resources are actually

06:43.380 --> 06:58.636
complementary to each other rather than 
exclusionary to each other. And I think that's a

06:58.656 --> 07:00.998
tension that we have today much greater than we had 
10, 15 years ago. Does it vary from department to

07:05.463 --> 07:07.406
department? Yeah, it would have to, because we 
have one, two, three departments that are almost

07:09.048 --> 07:16.739
exclusively graduate. Of course, their emphasis 
is going to be graduate. So we're really talking in

07:19.103 --> 07:25.892
terms of those departments which have both 
undergraduate and graduate programs. OK, which

07:25.912 --> 07:27.154
only is about three. Well, it's actually for when 
you consider Ed Psych. They don't have

07:30.177 --> 07:42.105
undergraduate majors, but they do have a 
tremendous undergraduate service

07:30.177 --> 07:42.105
responsibility in terms of the introductory Ed 
Psych course plus the special ed program. service

07:42.305 --> 07:55.459
come in because I am hearing that a lot of 
departments are saying we are the research

07:42.305 --> 07:55.459
department and such and so and so is the service and 
they don't do the research that we do and that kind

07:42.305 --> 07:55.459
of thing. Where does service fit in? Service sort 
of tags along and gets plugged in realistically

07:58.202 --> 08:08.914
and is not a part of the somewhat advisedly. It is 
and it isn't. You have a responsibility there But

08:12.528 --> 08:18.476
you can't make it in service on its own. We like to 
look at all three of them together and recognize

08:19.357 --> 08:29.331
that everybody's going to have different roles 
proportionately in each of the three areas. And I

08:29.351 --> 08:41.067
think as 15 years ago, everyone pretty well 
focused on the teaching role and some service role

08:29.351 --> 08:41.067
and some research role, that emphasis has now 
shifted to the research emphasis at third.

08:49.643 --> 09:06.328
Ideally, those three would come together so that 
your service would in fact be an extension of your

08:49.643 --> 09:06.328
research and your admissions teacher education 
by doing research and development work with the

08:49.643 --> 09:06.328
schools. We would then also, at the same time, be 
purposes or responding needs that they might

09:06.916 --> 09:11.943
have. And then from that grows new information and 
things that could be integrated into teaching. So

09:17.530 --> 09:22.637
ideally, all three of them complement each other.

09:24.580 --> 09:29.286
I guess that's a major way that we changed.

09:29.326 --> 09:32.350
That's not inconsistent with the way higher 
education in general typically changes. You

09:34.644 --> 09:50.136
know, you started a teaching institution and the 
profession of higher education is

09:34.644 --> 09:50.136
hierarchically structured such that the epitome 
of being a full professor is a researcher,

09:34.644 --> 09:50.136
publisher, expert in the field, and so forth. This 
is more toward graduate work than undergraduate

09:54.523 --> 09:56.966
work. And then promotion and tenure and all of that 
is always still, there's still that pressure, and

09:56.986 --> 10:04.758
it's still based on your research. Well, and your 
teaching, too. But that's what's more important.

10:09.565 --> 10:14.313
Well, that's what the perception of the faculty 
is. Where the dean has played, the coordinator has

10:14.333 --> 10:17.878
played a very strong role in this. is trying to make 
some kind of a balance in there, recognizing that

10:18.365 --> 10:30.998
when you have a faculty of 175, 500 majors, that 
there are many different roles within the college

10:18.365 --> 10:30.998
that have to be played. And that not everyone needs 
to, nor should, fit that research program. A

10:38.306 --> 10:40.788
faculty of 175 total? That's headcount. That 
includes health and PE lecturers. And EDCI has

10:46.445 --> 10:48.387
100? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No. Well, we were just 
talking about, he must have been talking about

10:50.430 --> 10:53.854
support staff. He said he had a staff, like, and 
there was 100 people in his staff. Well, I applied

10:57.017 --> 10:59.981
for my graduate students to graduate assistants 
as well. Oh, okay. EDCI faculty were numbered

11:01.002 --> 11:03.425
right about 40. Oh, okay. Regular tenure track 
faculty, about 40. I see. I imagine that that's, I

11:08.315 --> 11:14.102
can get that, those figures and all that, you know, 
what the breakdown is by the department. Okay,

11:14.182 --> 11:15.223
good. All right. Now, you have always taught, 
right? You've always had some teaching

11:17.526 --> 11:20.749
assignment limited or? Since 75. Okay. Has the 
growth that we have experienced in the college

11:24.233 --> 11:31.842
affected your ability to work with the students? 
the time or the, you know, whatever. I should know

11:35.848 --> 11:36.189
it. Well, it's interesting you should ask that. 
This particular semester, because this semester

11:38.112 --> 11:50.210
I'm teaching the foundations of secondary 
education, and typically I would go to my classes

11:38.112 --> 11:50.210
without two sections of 50 each. And just out of 
sheer necessity, I had to open both those up to the

11:51.171 --> 11:55.578
room. I had 66 kids, which I have seen where it's 
definitely taken a toll on me in terms of my ability

11:59.716 --> 12:03.820
to service that need. You still teach the graduate 
course every semester? Yes, in the spring. Once a

12:07.904 --> 12:08.424
semester? I mean, once a year. Yeah. OK. In terms of 
the student affairs office,

12:10.506 --> 12:28.963
the thing that has enabled us to really be 
responsive to the kids, the single thing, I have a

12:10.506 --> 12:28.963
database and knowledge of people who deal with 
those things. There's no way that we could have

12:29.433 --> 12:37.040
effectively given them the kids that we do deal 
with. Good staff, obviously,

12:37.060 --> 12:50.673
but in terms of just sheer numbers, we haven't 
added a secretarial position in the student

12:37.060 --> 12:50.673
affairs area in 12 years. How many years have you 
been in this position? Since 1983. And I also was

12:58.694 --> 13:07.887
acting in it the year that Dean Limbaugh was acting 
dean, in between the Huber and the Corrigan,

12:58.694 --> 13:07.887
during that year I was acting. And I went back for 
one year as assistant dean. What about

13:12.533 --> 13:13.815
collaboration? And being from the eighth floor, 
looking down, and you can probably tell me more

13:13.855 --> 13:22.407
about interaction between departments, more so 
than among the departments, because I get that

13:22.876 --> 13:28.806
probably from department heads as far as 
collaborative work within their departments.

13:28.826 --> 13:31.771
But how do you see that collaborative effort? And I 
know the inquiry deals that Dean Corgan

13:31.791 --> 13:36.920
instigated have been very helpful in that. What 
else? Or how do you perceive it? Is it more or less? I

13:40.546 --> 13:42.229
think overall it's more.

13:45.014 --> 13:48.259
I'm not sure if you're able to look at it in 1969 
dollars and 1987 dollars and build that inflation

13:48.830 --> 13:53.918
factor. And I'm not sure if it would be more or not. 
But because we have more faculty and so forth, it

13:57.042 --> 14:01.429
certainly seems like we have more. And I know there 
are more specific instances where faculty are

14:01.449 --> 14:10.182
working across departments with each other. And 
after that, it was limited.

14:18.833 --> 14:26.023
The programs 15, 17 years ago were not that complex 
either. It was fairly straightforward teacher

14:26.043 --> 14:28.787
education.

14:31.390 --> 14:34.454
We didn't have adult education or vocational 
education. We did not have special education. We

14:38.740 --> 14:43.727
just basically had straight elementary and 
secondary certification. And then as our

14:44.129 --> 14:49.674
knowledge base has increased, too, with respect 
to teacher education, what it takes to support

14:44.129 --> 14:49.674
that. Then the college has grown and adapted to it 
and more people are involved in

14:51.216 --> 14:57.042
cross-disciplines. It leads to where we have so 
many non-traditional kinds of programs as well,

14:57.062 --> 15:13.478
such as the Human Performance Lab and how to do 
physical therapy and pre-nursing and

14:57.062 --> 15:13.478
pre-occupational exercise technology. Okay.

15:18.108 --> 15:20.932
What about perceptions of others of the college? 
And certainly you've been here and have had a feel

15:21.012 --> 15:31.266
for how this college is perceived by the others in 
the university and then even in the more external

15:21.012 --> 15:31.266
environment. Yeah, I've seen a lot of change in 
that. I think the college has started out in a very

15:34.370 --> 15:43.903
strong position within the university and has 
maintained that strong position, and when I say

15:44.204 --> 15:49.190
strong, in relationship to the other disciplines 
of the university. Okay. Especially for a major,

15:50.372 --> 16:02.568
especially since A&M has moved into the, quote, 
major university research status, has

15:50.372 --> 16:02.568
maintained a strong position because of our 
roots. And that is, early on, Dr. Hubert was both

16:03.729 --> 16:10.818
Dean of Liberal Arts, actually Dean of Arts and 
Sciences. Right. and then Dean of Liberal Arts and

16:12.470 --> 16:17.517
Dean of Education. He, in fact, had hired many of 
the faculty in Arts and Sciences.

16:29.534 --> 16:36.063
So established before it was even required what's 
called the University Council on Teacher

16:29.534 --> 16:36.063
Education. And that was an interdisciplinary 
group housed in the College of Education, but

16:42.727 --> 16:54.959
involved other faculty and other disciplines who 
had responsibility for the teaching fields and

16:42.727 --> 16:54.959
the content of the degree outside. Is that still in 
effect? That's still very much in effect. Yeah,

16:57.341 --> 17:04.488
it's a requirement now by NCAID and TEA that you 
have this kind of a council. But it works here, I

17:04.508 --> 17:09.493
think, much more effectively than in most 
institutions because of the historical base. and

17:10.047 --> 17:21.298
that we have so much tradition and so much history 
of a very close relationship between the

17:10.047 --> 17:21.298
disciplines and the College of Ed. I think because 
also the number of our faculty, as that has

17:21.398 --> 17:38.755
evolved, the kinds of faculty that we've been able 
to recruit, and going back to your question on the

17:21.398 --> 17:38.755
goal about interaction, interdisciplinary 
kinds of things, the way that our people work with

17:21.398 --> 17:38.755
others on campus has been able to maintain that 
strong position, both realistically and in

17:39.072 --> 17:48.307
perception.

17:50.551 --> 18:00.948
I can say that we have always, from the higher 
administration, been treated fairly. By that you

18:00.968 --> 18:01.789
mean? In the allowance of resources and all of 
that? Yeah. I think if you were to displace this

18:07.552 --> 18:21.932
college of education in a similar institution 
like a UT or what have you, that you'd see a major

18:07.552 --> 18:21.932
difference in the kinds of resources that we have 
been given and increasingly the kinds of

18:07.552 --> 18:21.932
resources that we've got. Is that attributed more 
to the leadership? Is the dean responsible for,

18:24.716 --> 18:29.042
just like the department heads, you know, try to 
get as many resources for their department. Is

18:32.302 --> 18:34.165
that the same way with the deans trying to? I think 
so, but he wouldn't be able to do that without

18:34.185 --> 18:45.042
having the strong faculty and the strong programs 
of the faculty of Shellock to do that. But you have

18:45.162 --> 18:48.548
to have both there, and I think it's due to both. 
Plus, we've had a central administration who has

18:55.972 --> 18:59.536
seen the value in having a strong college 
education. Has that changed from administration

18:59.556 --> 19:02.038
to administration? Oh, yeah. Yeah. A lot?

19:07.484 --> 19:07.824
Just, I mean. Where do we stand on these things? 
I'll throw them out if you want me to. Well, you're

19:12.028 --> 19:15.492
just going to have this stuff, right? OK. We're 
probably in the most difficult period we've ever

19:15.552 --> 19:18.935
been in right now. OK. Simply perception. Two 
problems. A lack of knowledge of the role and scope

19:26.853 --> 19:35.107
of the College of Education. Because of the number 
of, because of the complexity of the institution

19:35.688 --> 19:42.960
now. Right. A lack of interest, but a lack of...

19:44.884 --> 19:50.413
Embodyment? Not being able to devote the amount of 
time necessary to get up to speed and to learn what

19:52.435 --> 20:00.946
needs to be learned. Because there's so many other 
areas which the administration is familiar with,

20:00.966 --> 20:11.019
they're already comfortable in those settings, 
so it's much easier to go ahead in those settings.

20:11.039 --> 20:12.981
To re-educate or re-educate? Yeah, and we're 
talking ground zero. So, it's... Yeah, that's a

20:16.506 --> 20:21.632
problem. That's a problem. But up until this time, 
we've had really good support. I don't think we

20:26.700 --> 20:29.303
have it now. But it takes a lot more effort on our 
part to communicate.

20:38.294 --> 20:39.515
Let me address outside. OK.

20:44.221 --> 20:50.809
Inside the institution, we have gone from no

20:51.413 --> 21:00.043
that there being very little of any perception 
that we even have a college of education.

21:00.063 --> 21:08.313
Literally what many superintendents and 
principals and personnel directors say is that

21:00.063 --> 21:08.313
now the best college of education is here. And in 
fact, I get calls all the time telling me or asking

21:08.333 --> 21:15.701
me, what can I do to recruit your kids? I want her 
just like her. or two more just like him. He's

21:22.743 --> 21:28.150
coming from a wide variety all over the state. Our 
kids are in really good demand. Of course, a lot of

21:30.393 --> 21:34.177
it has to do with the caliber of kid that comes in at 
the beginning of the program. We like to think it's

21:34.197 --> 21:36.981
all program A, but it's not. It's a combination of 
the two. Our graduate students have gotten

21:40.886 --> 21:46.793
placements. Our undergraduate students get very 
good placements. And I think the perception has

21:51.337 --> 22:13.152
been for the last few years and is that if you want 
this program at any stage, you go to Texas Freshman

21:51.337 --> 22:13.152
and transfer increase this year over last year was 
54%. As a whole, we had a 9% increase, but if you take

22:13.172 --> 22:18.981
the number of new freshman transfers,

22:19.720 --> 22:27.110
One September 86 to one September 87 had a 54% 
increase. One piece, if you're not familiar with

22:27.410 --> 22:38.305
this, that I think is important for you to build in 
at some point, Sylvia, and it's not related to

22:27.410 --> 22:38.305
exactly what you're asking me, but I can give you a 
chart which shows this. For the past eight years or

22:40.808 --> 22:49.660
so, and I haven't gone back further than that, we 
get our students particularly at the

22:49.960 --> 22:55.605
undergraduate level in the College of Education, 
was really interesting. Because for about the

22:55.625 --> 23:19.208
last four years, we would start with a freshman 
class in about 250 to 275, which represented

22:55.625 --> 23:19.208
fairly consistently about 3%

22:55.625 --> 23:19.208
of the total university freshman class. When that 
class became a sophomore, it had grown to over 400.

23:28.482 --> 23:33.169
It represented roughly 6% of that class at the 
university. When that class became a junior, it

23:33.189 --> 23:44.164
represented over 8% of that class at the 
university, a number somewhere 600 to 700

23:33.189 --> 23:44.164
students. When that class became a senior, It 
represented anywhere from 10 to over 11 percent of

23:47.504 --> 23:57.777
the university senior class and numbered in the 
neighborhood of 9 to 9.50. And one of the things

23:59.039 --> 24:07.490
that concerns me is that this year we had such a 
significant increase in our freshman class. The

24:07.510 --> 24:10.414
university had such a significant increase in its 
freshman class. So if I'm looking at a higher

24:11.295 --> 24:16.482
percentage right now as freshmen, what are we 
looking at? And the trends will tell us that we'll

24:16.917 --> 24:29.307
be looking at 10% to 11% of that senior class four 
years down the road, which we'll have in the

24:16.917 --> 24:29.307
neighborhood, could have in the neighborhood of 
11 to 1,200 seniors. Well, how do you feel that all

24:29.327 --> 24:34.099
this upheaval and this change, this drastic that 
we're looking at in the whole teacher education

24:34.400 --> 24:41.570
program is going to affect, because these will be 
under the old program anyway, right? These that

24:41.870 --> 24:45.275
entered this year will be in the same one. But 
what's going to happen now? I mean, I know nobody

24:46.797 --> 24:51.183
knows for sure, but how do you feel about what might 
happen?

24:53.887 --> 25:03.580
I'm torn between, one, wanting to control the 
numbers, to be compatible with resources so we

24:53.887 --> 25:03.580
have a quality program, with the other side that i 
want to produce as many good teachers as we can

25:03.880 --> 25:32.622
because our kids are getting a good experience are 
being received well and are doing good jobs and i

25:03.880 --> 25:32.622
don't want to cut back for equality's sake 
supposedly and for some other reasons that might

25:03.880 --> 25:32.622
help us here we're returning kids away to other 
programs which they may or may not get as good

25:03.880 --> 25:32.622
preparation plus I have some concern with the land 
grant mission. On the other side, you can't

25:37.405 --> 25:42.911
prepare everybody. Just like I was saying, I've 
got 163 kids right now, and I have noticed, I've

25:42.931 --> 25:55.305
commented several times on how I don't feel like I 
have done as good a job in the classroom this time as

25:42.931 --> 25:55.305
in the past. And that has a lot to do with my style in 
terms of, because I like a lot of interaction. I've

26:02.217 --> 26:03.538
been trying to know all my kids. I wind up knowing 
none of my kids. That kind of thing. OK. Some of the

26:09.303 --> 26:10.605
highlights, perhaps. And you were here as a 
student. You got your master's and your doctorate

26:12.226 --> 26:14.808
at Texas A&M. And then you also started working 
here right after you graduated. Well, you were

26:18.752 --> 26:21.735
working while you were getting the degrees. So 
tell me how that changes. Because I haven't even

26:23.797 --> 26:26.079
started doing anything with students yet. But 
looking back now to your years as a student, And

26:30.314 --> 26:38.986
then as it penetrated all the way to the top, how has 
that evolved in your own perceptions? How do you

26:39.006 --> 26:50.062
see it now versus how you saw it when you were a 
student,

26:39.006 --> 26:50.062
maybe? Yeah. As a student, I tended to see things 
more simplistically, which in all bad. Well,

26:57.922 --> 27:00.365
there probably were a lot simpler then, too, I 
mean. Yeah. A lot of the issues were a lot simpler.

27:06.291 --> 27:10.235
I think that we had some really good faculty back 
then. I felt very good about my experience both at

27:10.255 --> 27:14.560
the master's and the doctoral level. Some of those 
same folks who were their strengths then are

27:17.003 --> 27:23.550
still, you know, strengths today. Shoots, Steny 
Johnson. Someone told me that 90%, and I was asked

27:25.816 --> 27:45.119
to verify this, and I don't know why I have to go 
through the document, that 90% of the people that

27:25.816 --> 27:45.119
Dean Hubert, attributing the fact that he was so 
astute in picking the right kinds of people for the

27:25.816 --> 27:45.119
life, that 90% of the people that he had hired were 
still here and were still productive. Does that

27:45.179 --> 27:46.281
sound high? It wouldn't be too high. I mean, that's 
going to be pretty close. And I can vouch for that.

27:54.410 --> 27:55.772
Both he and Dean Corrigan Now they see, he saw and 
Dean Corbin sees that the most important function

27:56.123 --> 28:12.643
that Dean plays is in the recruitment and hiring 
the very best faculty.

28:13.464 --> 28:16.668
Without that, everything else just falls apart. 
And so they both place heavy, heavy emphasis on

28:17.529 --> 28:21.313
that. I know Dr. Hewlett many times. And Corgan, 
too, just gnashed teeth over those decisions

28:24.710 --> 28:41.106
because they don't look at it just as hiring an 
individual, but rather as an investment in the

28:24.710 --> 28:41.106
state, in the lives of our young people. Because if 
you take a person today making a $30,000 or $40,000

28:41.166 --> 28:53.518
decision

28:41.166 --> 28:53.518
just to bring that person in, you're making in 
excess of a million or two million dollar decision

28:54.022 --> 29:02.494
over the life of that professor.

29:06.139 --> 29:17.496
So when you couch it in those kinds of terms, and 
particularly at the tenure point, that's really

29:06.139 --> 29:17.496
when you're really assessing the value of that 
individual to the program. Is the hiring still

29:18.337 --> 29:19.759
done? you know, on recommendations from the 
departments and the process. I had one teacher

29:24.058 --> 29:32.969
say, you know, that if they were hired by Dean 
Huber, just outright said, if you will not accept

29:24.058 --> 29:32.969
that position, you just went to interview, you can 
have a job here. And she says it was great, but in

29:33.069 --> 29:41.019
thinking back, she says that's not the way it 
should have been done because, you know, it should

29:33.069 --> 29:41.019
be done by the department and what are the needs, 
you know, that kind of thing. Was that just

29:41.039 --> 29:44.363
something that happened once in a while or was it 
just a... unusual yeah typically it he bobbed out

29:45.119 --> 30:11.548
of the park recommendation

29:45.119 --> 30:11.548
but his recommendation very strong and if that's 
usually in other words now what is the process when

29:45.119 --> 30:11.548
you're going to when you need a new position how 
does that evolve a new tenure track position okay

29:45.119 --> 30:11.548
the department heads will consult with their 
faculty in terms of what that position is. Or if we

30:16.427 --> 30:21.575
have a position where someone leaves, they may 
want to take that position and redefine it. So it

30:21.595 --> 30:26.122
starts with the definition of the position in the 
department. And then that definition is shared

30:26.863 --> 30:37.739
with the dean and massaged and looked at in light of 
its compatibility with him a little bit or what

30:26.863 --> 30:37.739
have you. That's agreed upon. And then the 
departments advertise that position nationally

30:38.967 --> 30:45.917
through the search process. And it's a faculty 
search process. And typically, then, we'll bring

30:48.561 --> 30:51.505
in three to four people. And then out of that two or 
three day interview process, the one who stops on

30:51.525 --> 31:00.439
that will be the dean. And then at the end of that 
process, the department head or however the

31:06.524 --> 31:13.573
department is structured, will get input from all 
the different interview stops. Because

31:14.894 --> 31:29.933
typically they involve faculty large group, 
faculty small group, program area, one-on-one,

31:14.894 --> 31:29.933
graduate students,

31:14.894 --> 31:29.933
dean, phillips, as in faculties typically. And 
they will synthesize all that input and then make

31:30.588 --> 31:34.701
the determination. And also, they generally have 
a seminar that they will give for faculty and

31:35.043 --> 31:40.139
graduate students. Then the department head will 
bring the faculty's record.
