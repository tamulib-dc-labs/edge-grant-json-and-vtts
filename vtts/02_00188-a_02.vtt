WEBVTT

00:03.760 --> 00:05.102
Did anybody meet you? How did you find a place to 
spend the night that night and a place to live? We

00:12.070 --> 00:13.792
had to go to Brian. Okay. We stayed in a building 
that was...

00:23.745 --> 00:25.206
It's a pawn shop now. It's on north... north of 
the...

00:33.815 --> 00:41.564
See, the courthouse was built like this, and it was 
all open on that. And then the main street was down

00:41.584 --> 00:46.329
here. And the reason for the change, moving the 
stuff down the main street, was that the rent got

00:47.871 --> 00:57.222
too high around the courthouse. And so there 
wasn't anything there, just some big old houses.

01:02.435 --> 01:13.929
And one of them up there, up there,

01:02.435 --> 01:13.929
what was it, the 24th, it'd be about 23rd Street or 
something. It was on that side. There was a house

01:14.830 --> 01:20.838
that we stayed in until our furniture came. The 
furniture was shipped by railroad.

01:28.026 --> 01:30.129
Did you bring any toys or anything with you? No. No, 
there wasn't much room in that old car, except it

01:32.135 --> 01:39.806
was a big outfit. It had plenty of room in it. But I 
don't remember that one. But it was so big and so

01:51.723 --> 01:56.630
long that we didn't own it very long. About what 
speed could it drive? Okay. That's going to go up

02:00.400 --> 02:02.302
50, 60 miles. Oh, it would? Really? Oh, it was a 
powerful engine. Did your dad have to work on it

02:06.307 --> 02:08.149
much? No. It was sold here in a fellow that had a...

02:11.112 --> 02:25.328
We traded it for a 21 Dodge

02:11.112 --> 02:25.328
because Mama could drive that. With a pillow 
behind her. Otherwise, she couldn't drive. So

02:32.137 --> 02:35.781
that's the reason we got rid of her. How did y'all 
find a place to live? Oh, the place to live. You mean

02:39.965 --> 02:40.846
on the campus? Yes, sir. They were all set out. They 
were set out by the administration. Okay.

02:49.595 --> 02:51.737
Describe the house y'all ended up with. one we 
ended up with was on the end of what's called

02:53.000 --> 02:56.845
Quality Road. You know where that is? It's a street 
that's straight south. I'll have to get a map to

03:06.137 --> 03:07.819
show it. It's the one that goes... By the 
President's house now? Yeah. Okay.

03:17.432 --> 03:21.657
And so that that building there was supposed to be 
for the entomology department when Dr. Bilsing

03:22.345 --> 03:33.718
was head of the entomology department. What's his 
name? Bilsing. B-I-L-S-I-N-G.

03:35.601 --> 03:45.132
And the house we lived in is on Texas, on Bush Drive 
right now.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.039
We'll have to look and see what the street number 
is. It's the one that burned On Texas Avenue a while

03:52.822 --> 03:54.524
back. You mean on George Bush? Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, on the corner. Yeah, well, we lived in that

03:59.650 --> 04:01.732
house for... When it was on the campus. On the 
campus, right down there. It's the last house on

04:04.835 --> 04:07.458
this side. Your last house on this side was ours. 
The next house was one that Walton's had, T.O.

04:15.087 --> 04:17.970
Walton and his family had. And then the next house 
was supposed to be for the head of the Agricultural

04:21.222 --> 04:31.432
Experiment Station. A fellow named Connor, I 
remember, was one of them that lived in that house.

04:36.938 --> 04:42.343
And then the next house, up there on the corner, was 
Dean Bowman's house. And across the street from

04:44.105 --> 04:50.031
there, next to the guy in the hall, was

04:50.635 --> 04:57.222
Frapp's house. Dr. Frapp's. F-R-A-P-P? No, not P, 
not double P. I think he was just playing. F-R-A-P?

05:07.573 --> 05:09.094
S. Huh? S-A. No, Frapp's. Frapp's. F-R-A-P-S. 
What did he teach? He was a...

05:24.824 --> 05:27.348
Chemists for the state of Texas.

05:30.193 --> 05:42.472
And they had a building

05:30.193 --> 05:42.472
which is now pretty close to the biology building. 
About how long did it take your furniture, your

05:42.492 --> 05:48.422
family's furniture, to get here after y'all got 
here? Oh, probably a million.

05:57.207 --> 05:58.309
Two or three weeks. You could see it was all crated. 
The only way you could ship it, we didn't have it.

06:07.441 --> 06:20.740
And they had to get some wagons and horses, and they 
hauled it from the railroad tracks up there, right

06:07.441 --> 06:20.740
up there. How big was the college station? The 
railroad station for the college. How big was it?

06:27.544 --> 06:29.286
It exists over here. It's that size?

06:34.414 --> 06:37.619
It exists on 30. You go over that way. That's the old 
building. Okay. Somebody built a model of it up

06:42.226 --> 06:44.649
here. Yes, sir. Well, it looks like that. It was 
about that size. No, that one's small. Okay. It was

06:51.820 --> 06:52.341
bigger. Look at the one on 30. You can find out how 
big it was. It was a huge thing. There were two of

07:01.795 --> 07:04.058
them. There was the SP and the INGN. Right side by 
side. And the two tracks came down there like that.

07:14.052 --> 07:16.596
Then they went down their little ways and crossed 
like this. Was there any feeling that one of those

07:17.657 --> 07:21.202
railroads was better than the other? No, you had to 
use it. You had to use both of them. That's what I

07:25.071 --> 07:25.792
thought.

07:30.238 --> 07:34.384
You had to get to certain lines.

07:36.988 --> 07:47.845
Now the INGN

07:36.988 --> 07:47.845
came through Hearn and you could take that and you 
could wind up in Kansas City the next day. Now the

07:53.425 --> 08:00.894
Southern Pacific, they had a good train service, 
excellent, excellent. In the morning, you got two

08:00.914 --> 08:08.002
trains going, one north and one south like this, 
stopped everywhere. And then in the afternoon,

08:09.624 --> 08:12.988
they did the same thing. Same

08:13.028 --> 08:17.814
thing. And then later, they put that streamliner 
on. Now that was in 28. That was much later.

08:32.571 --> 08:34.293
It stopped here. But it was a through train. It 
didn't stop at all the little towns. No, you see it

08:40.521 --> 08:47.469
stopped here because of the federal law that 
established the college. The moral act specified

08:48.751 --> 08:52.255
that the That the train have to stop at any... I did 
not know that. You should go read the moral act.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.067
Very good, very good. 1860-some. Yeah, 1863. 
Yeah. Well, you can read that, and it'll tell you

09:12.312 --> 09:22.461
that the clause in there that you have to, the train 
has to stop and discharge passengers. This is an

09:23.943 --> 09:27.008
editorial note to the typist. Mention of the 
Morrill Act, M-O-R-R-I-L-L, causes me to offer

09:27.969 --> 09:32.996
this addition. Once, after giving a freshman 
history lecture here on this campus about 30 years

09:34.318 --> 09:52.465
ago, a young man came up to me and introduced 
himself and told me that he was the

09:34.318 --> 09:52.465
great-great-grandson of Senator Morrill and 
that he was the first member of the family to go to a

09:53.086 --> 09:55.069
land-grant college. I presume he was telling me 
the truth. I did check and find out that he was a

09:59.115 --> 10:15.321
descendant, but I thought how nice it is that the 
first descendant of the man who sponsored the

09:59.115 --> 10:15.321
Land-Grant Act, the first one that ever attended a 
land-grant college, came to Texas A&M. End of

10:15.821 --> 10:17.524
note. So you all moved in. Describe the house and 
the neighborhood. Well, they took, they had to go

10:24.259 --> 10:28.764
take those big old wagons and things. They went 
down there and unloaded that boxcar. And they

10:32.569 --> 10:35.692
brought it up there and it was all crated. Did the 
college do that? Yeah. Okay. See, Dr. Bilson was

10:40.397 --> 10:43.181
single. So he lost his He didn't, he lost the fact 
that he had to. And another one that was, that that

10:53.098 --> 10:58.944
house had been lived in was Charles Friley. And his 
wife died in that house. His first wife. And

11:05.091 --> 11:07.073
Charles Friley was the registrar. He later went to 
Iowa State College. About how many faculty houses

11:12.439 --> 11:15.822
were there on campus? Oh, there's a whole, you 
know, everything. 50? 100? Yeah, 50. At least 50 or

11:20.177 --> 11:22.060
so, or more than that. Describe the house y'all 
were in. How big was it? How many bedrooms? You just

11:25.965 --> 11:28.488
had to go over there and look at it. No, but... Oh, it 
had...

11:28.508 --> 11:40.844
Oh, it had a big old kitchen in the back end.

11:40.864 --> 11:43.888
Bathroom, good bathroom. And my mother... 
brought in that great big old range, that cast iron

11:45.980 --> 11:51.726
range, and put it up in there. See, we had heatwood 
wood. We had cookwood wood. The only other thing we

11:56.971 --> 12:07.301
had was some of the families had a kerosene stove. 
Three or four burners had a kerosene stove until

12:07.401 --> 12:11.786
1928. And that's when we brought in the natural 
gas. But you did have electricity, but nobody had

12:16.760 --> 12:21.526
electric heating then, of course. No. And y'all 
didn't use any coal to heat with or to cook with?

12:27.253 --> 12:27.774
Some coal? The college

12:28.735 --> 12:36.124
used coal. And that was an argument with the 
natural gas people. They tried to tie the The

12:46.679 --> 12:54.913
colleagues drew a contract so that the people 
around here could get it. In other words, then they

12:54.934 --> 13:07.956
opened it up, and we're going to

12:54.934 --> 13:07.956
give gas to everybody, see? But the guy made a 
mistake.

13:14.827 --> 13:26.881
The Lone Star Gas Company went in there and they 
gave their construction crews all the data on the

13:14.827 --> 13:26.881
part they built around there. They didn't tell 
them not to do it.

13:34.049 --> 13:40.817
And so what happened was, I was out there one day and 
See, our house was on that side. This was after

13:43.906 --> 13:48.451
College Park was built in 28. And our house was 
built in 24.

13:56.420 --> 14:00.384
I saw them over there, and they were laying that 
pipe for a while. And then I walked out there one

14:00.504 --> 14:05.009
day, and here they were with torches cutting it up. 
And I knew what they were trying to do. So I called my

14:07.351 --> 14:10.635
father and said, they're cutting that. pipe up 
trying to fill those ditches back then. He came

14:14.974 --> 14:22.681
down there and he told that construction foreman, 
you're on private property, get off. So then they

14:25.264 --> 14:28.587
had to go to negotiation. But we did get it all 
right. Now, when you all got here, you came in the

14:32.091 --> 14:36.114
summer when you moved? About in August. August. 
And then school started for you as a first grader?

14:42.827 --> 14:44.590
No. What grade were you in? I wasn't in any. Oh, you 
were too young? No, my birthday is October the 7th.

14:56.367 --> 14:56.768
Okay. Therefore, I didn't qualify to start 
school. So what did you do that year? I went to some

15:05.661 --> 15:08.365
sort of... preschool. I don't remember what it 
was. Who were your family's first close friends?

15:16.109 --> 15:18.192
With whom did you all make... The Waltons. 
Describe the Waltons, please. They were a

15:22.258 --> 15:23.420
wonderful family. Wonderful. The oldest one was 
what's her name?

15:35.537 --> 15:35.938
They had The oldest girl, he married,

15:38.112 --> 15:47.784
he was an instructor. I mean, he did some, you have 
to excuse me sometimes. Oh, I understand. Don't

15:55.074 --> 15:56.015
worry about that. My memory, your memory is good. 
Mine fails.

16:03.284 --> 16:03.985
Just a minute.

16:06.749 --> 16:13.716
Well, the oldest girl, she was much older than I 
was. She died here just a short time ago.

16:20.604 --> 16:25.609
And then they had a, oh, yeah, they had Turner. 
Turner, oh, now I remember. Turner Walton was the

16:29.553 --> 16:32.296
oldest son. He was going to school to be a doctor, 
which we did. We did. Turtle water. And then this

16:41.210 --> 16:50.799
oldest girl, and then there was another girl, and 
then there was Teal. Was he about your age? Yeah. We

16:53.502 --> 16:55.064
all played together. All right. Describe... They 
were good. Now... I told you we were on this side of

17:04.175 --> 17:06.397
the street. But wait just a minute. Describe Mr. 
Walton. I don't know. What size man was he and what

17:09.921 --> 17:13.986
was his purpose?

17:15.307 --> 17:16.809
He was a large man. But his real quality was he was 
head of the extension service. That's where the

17:26.760 --> 17:29.743
original job was. But he was a man, when you asked 
him to talk, he didn't talk. He'd get in front of a

17:34.837 --> 17:38.543
crowd and talk to them. Was he pleasant to be with? I 
never heard, never saw him. When

17:46.335 --> 17:58.213
we were there, we

17:46.335 --> 17:58.213
got smallpox. No, we didn't get smallpox. We got 
chicken pox. And we never got nipped there either.

18:05.516 --> 18:06.477
Two that we missed. But there were others. And they 
quarantined it. The doctor had quarantined it.

18:15.166 --> 18:17.148
The doctor quarantined us. So dad went to town and 
got him a place to stay. We had a trolley. You

18:25.377 --> 18:26.438
remember the trolley? It ran down Old College? 
Yeah, it was there. It was there. About how often

18:31.283 --> 18:32.804
did it run?

18:36.147 --> 18:37.569
I don't know. It ran at the end of the day or back in 
the morning. I don't really know. Remember what it

18:43.314 --> 18:45.216
cost to ride it? I just know the man that propelled 
it. That's all I knew. He worked in it. I think they

18:53.463 --> 18:58.508
just run in the morning and in the evening. They 
just carry a bunch of people back and forth. Did it

19:00.882 --> 19:04.666
get its electricity from above or on the ground? 
Overhead. Overhead. And the E.E. department

19:09.791 --> 19:12.213
would back them up? And where did it go downtown, 
Brian? Where in downtown was its turnaround? Was

19:20.481 --> 19:22.603
it on Main Street or at the courthouse? No. Well, 
GTE or, you know, where it is. And the building that

19:28.895 --> 19:37.122
the old

19:28.895 --> 19:37.122
Eagle was in? Mm-hmm. Directly across from the 
library in Bryant. Okay. That building is there,

19:42.647 --> 19:46.491
and I think that somebody else is taking it over. 
But it ended up right there. Right there. In that

19:49.173 --> 19:50.174
side street. Okay. Between there and the E 
building. Okay. Or the end, whatever it is.

19:57.080 --> 19:57.340
Mm-hmm. The... It went there, and it went clean out 
to,

19:58.325 --> 20:06.236
went out to Ursul, all the way out. Okay. You could 
ride it through out there, and they had a convent

20:07.238 --> 20:09.982
out there. Out at Villa Maria. Yeah. It had a 
convent that was, had

20:13.527 --> 20:24.642
your, not nurses, your... Sisters. Sisters, 
mm-hmm. I took a... Music out there. All right, so

20:30.614 --> 20:43.166
the first year you're not going to school, what 
were your dad, as far as you recall, what were your

20:30.614 --> 20:43.166
dad's first assignments as a faculty member here? 
Get that department running. Was he the first one?

20:49.511 --> 20:50.973
Did he start ag engineering? No. You see, again, I 
told you about the one in Mississippi. Mm-hmm.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.688
training, they did it right here. It's right 
there. Right on the side of this, where the ag

21:04.031 --> 21:09.578
building is now. There was a huge building like 
this. The ag engineering building opened into

21:14.164 --> 21:18.229
that, which is sitting right here. There you go. 
You're right here. You can go down through there.

21:23.015 --> 21:28.542
And when they built the agriculture building in 
24, they tore that building down. How many faculty

21:29.028 --> 21:35.055
members were there in Ag Engineering when your dad 
came? He had one man. I

21:38.118 --> 21:52.534
don't think his name

21:38.118 --> 21:52.534
was Ernest. His name was Kearney.

21:57.099 --> 21:58.461
His last name was He was a Negro. They had two other 
men. That's all that was in the department. He was

22:09.300 --> 22:11.983
supposed to teach ag engineering. And so he was 
busy hustling

22:13.705 --> 22:21.314
men to work. They had the appropriations for like 
the whole thing. Now who was the Dean of

22:26.900 --> 22:29.443
Agriculture then? Kyle, describe him. We don't 
know much about him in terms of his personality.

22:37.197 --> 22:37.837
Great man. Describe him physically. About 5'8", 
5'9"? What color hair?

22:51.816 --> 22:52.658
Was he gray then? He was a young man. His wife was...

23:00.929 --> 23:01.810
She was gorgeous. And

23:03.772 --> 23:09.817
she just took care of everything. And

23:09.837 --> 23:24.650
when we got married, she sent word to my mother that 
she wanted to take me and Margaret to the Gilders.

23:24.670 --> 23:25.791
And she bought the rings. My, my. My, how great. 
Now, where did the Kyles live? Did they live on

23:34.846 --> 23:35.867
campus? Yeah. You know, that thing circled around 
here to the, what's the, towards the railroad

23:38.150 --> 23:48.204
where Auburn had his tower. It's on the north part 
of that circle. Okay. The first house was probably

23:51.949 --> 23:57.777
Dean Kyle's house. The second house was Dr. 
Mostella's house. And then on the corner would be

24:00.667 --> 24:06.475
Dr. Ellinger's house. Ellinger? Yeah. What did he 
teach? He was a college physician. Oh, yes, yes,

24:11.562 --> 24:12.644
yes. And the building they just tore down, that was 
the hospital. Yes, yes. Was it standing then? It

24:19.814 --> 24:22.097
was standing then. Okay. And the trolley came in on 
the east side of that and stopped right there in

24:22.237 --> 24:29.087
that little old house. or almost out in front of the 
lawn there. And that's where that trolley

24:34.658 --> 24:39.584
stopped.

24:39.604 --> 24:48.096
What about the, please share as much information 
as you can remember about the Bazells, because he

24:39.604 --> 24:48.096
was the president when you all got here. Well, the 
only thing I was telling you, the

24:49.498 --> 24:59.412
only thing I knew about him was the time he got 
around the house. Got what? Drowned out. Oh,

25:01.704 --> 25:02.565
describe that. Well, Dr. Rizal, the only thing 
wrong with him was that he was a

25:04.027 --> 25:24.031
man who would take it on himself not to let his 
subordinates react, but he'd react. You know. And

25:25.693 --> 25:29.297
so, I don't know the... See, he lived in that house 
right there. The president's house. The

25:35.931 --> 25:38.354
president's home, and it's faced this way. Right 
next to... And there was a building right here,

25:38.554 --> 25:44.602
which was a dormitory. It had... It was masonry all 
the way on each side of it, on each side of that

25:49.849 --> 25:55.496
thing. But the... All the... steps were in the 
middle of it were cast iron. The old cast iron, it

26:07.977 --> 26:13.044
was built all the way from the foundation to clear 
up, but it was cast iron. And you didn't even have

26:15.748 --> 26:19.734
treads on it. You had a tread on it, but you didn't. 
So what the kids did, you had these GI cans. They

26:27.305 --> 26:29.929
were about this tall. They called them GI cans, and 
they were water, heavy as hell, and about that big

26:30.517 --> 26:50.423
around, about 34, 30 inches tall, I guess, 
something like that. So that was a favorite trick

26:52.506 --> 27:00.456
for them for grinding their buddies out, because 
they'd get up on the roof, carry that water up there

27:01.246 --> 27:09.874
on the roof, and you'd be walking up there, and then 
all of a sudden, the water comes.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.695
I never did get around that. One time, he just 
missed me. That's all. He threw it right straight

27:16.059 --> 27:18.461
at me, but I missed him. But at that time, they 
decided they'd make a ruckus, these kids in the

27:19.942 --> 27:30.932
dormitory, and get the doctor over there. But they 
took their GI cans and rolled them down that

27:32.296 --> 27:39.583
stairway out of cast iron. You can imagine the 
racket that that had. So he came over there. He

27:43.887 --> 27:48.532
started up that stairs and got up there to the top. 
And he was going to go inside and see if he could

27:49.993 --> 27:55.398
straighten things out. About that time, those 
little boys took that can and turned it upside down

27:56.159 --> 28:02.185
over the parapet wall. and drowned him out. And he 
backed down, and he sat there. He backed down, and I

28:12.984 --> 28:20.975
don't know whether he looked up or something like 
that, and then he tried it again. And they had

28:22.216 --> 28:27.243
another can, and they had drowned him out a second 
time. And he just sat there on the steps and cried.

28:33.046 --> 28:34.327
Did he do anything to him? Did he punish him? No. 
Now, I interviewed his daughter two years ago. Do

28:42.014 --> 28:42.914
you remember her? She was an astonishingly pretty 
girl and went for two years as a freshman and a

28:44.175 --> 28:54.084
sophomore here in the early 20s. Yeah, they did. 
She attended classes. You see, there's another

28:58.287 --> 29:00.709
one, too. Mrs. Marstella. Mm-hmm. The dean's wife 
of the vet school, Dr. Mostella, she got

29:02.797 --> 29:25.227
everything done and all the coursework done, but 
they wouldn't let her sign a certificate to ask for

29:02.797 --> 29:25.227
a diploma. Do you remember any mistreatment of 
those few coeds? How were they treated by the... I

29:33.293 --> 29:34.394
never saw them. I never saw very many of them. I just 
knew them later as grown women or grown girls. They

29:43.143 --> 29:44.665
were much older than I was. This Bazell daughter 
who died two weeks ago at age 97. She's He's nine

29:51.363 --> 29:54.627
years older than I am. She said it was marvelous to 
be a co-ed then, because she said it was a lot of fun

29:54.647 --> 30:00.413
to be with all those boys. Oh, yeah. I gave her a 
photo of a picnic out on the lawn in front of the

30:02.876 --> 30:12.046
president's house, and Bernard Sabisa is 
standing over at one side. Do you remember Mr.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.249
Sabisa? No. No, he was gone when I got...

30:20.692 --> 30:24.415
I don't know, Marjorie Duncan.

30:27.638 --> 30:29.580
Duncan was head of the thing there. And she was my 
age. And I was a dried up shrimp. When I went to

30:39.108 --> 30:43.272
Interdandium, I weighed 105 pounds. And I 
couldn't expand my chest or anything. Yeah, the

30:52.028 --> 31:00.059
old colonel had to pass an examination to even go in 
the first two years of it. He was there and

31:01.261 --> 31:20.888
I don't know, I think I must have had some fevers, 
some rheumatic fevers years ago and it just, I've

31:01.261 --> 31:20.888
always been short of breath and so He looked at me 
and put his tape around me and I couldn't do

31:22.336 --> 31:30.898
nothing. And so he just, I saw him do this. He just 
grabbed ahold of it like this.
