WEBVTT

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.514
Arbiter of manners and morals for the community.

00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:10.150
And what was her official capacity?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.379
Well, Fred Smith, he was well known among his former students.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.726
They were the kind of faculty that would have students over.

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:30.917
And they would, of course, then once those students went on to become millionaires and zillionaires, they'd always come back and see Fred and Odette.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:35.843
And this was the way that worked.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.552
The oil patch has gone through many, many ups and downs, bangs and busts, as we say.

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:54.083
It's interesting, the people who do remain friends.

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:58.489
Now, getting back to Odette Smith, I should continue here.

00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:06.482
The biggest put down I ever had when I came here was from Odette.

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:08.826
She was something else.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:22.570
She was introducing me, I think it was when I first met her, and I told her I was from St. Paul, Minnesota, and she said,

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.745
you're not a damn Yankee, you're just a Northerner."

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:34.682
She said it with that Mississippi accent and I just wanted to crawl into the woodwork someplace.

00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:37.708
But anyway, she really did.

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.680
If she didn't like somebody, boy, I mean, they'd better be careful.

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:45.699
All right, other friends that y'all made?

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:54.998
Well, of course, in the department there were, and Bob is still, and Tony Ganji in geophysics, they're still very close friends.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.434
And of course, I have made friends in recent years since I've been retired, I've made friends in the community.

00:02:04.236 --> 00:02:06.360
And I know your wife, Jo, is

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:14.375
I'm glad to have her as a member in the Women's Club because you meet a whole lot of people that you would never get to meet.

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.717
I really enjoyed being a member of the Women's Club.

00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:17.639
But that was after?

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.020
That was after I retired.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.147
I think I was still working part-time when I got to, when I was asked to belong to the Women's Club.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:34.879
But I have really enjoyed it because as I said, people that I wouldn't get to meet because I would meet all faculty and I wouldn't meet, and I wouldn't meet

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:41.021
you know people in the community and of course that's a whole other history in itself.

00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.444
Did y'all get involved in any community activities?

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:45.487
No, we really didn't.

00:02:45.507 --> 00:02:46.468
Boy Scouts Church?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.116
No, I belonged to, it was a long time before I joined a church.

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:58.385
I joined St. Thomas Episcopal Church and enjoy that very much.

00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:02.571
I was born and bred a Presbyterian

00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:09.638
And of course, the old saw goes, you're a Presbyterian born and bred, you're a Presbyterian until you're dead.

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:22.239
But this somehow, and I sometimes think some of this ritual in the Episcopal Church gets a little bit beyond me, and I think of it as I don't think so.

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:27.968
But anyway, I really enjoy that church, and it's very congenial.

00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:32.154
A lot of young people and it's a lot of, it's a very enjoyable experience.

00:03:32.214 --> 00:03:37.140
Alright, describe the shopping for a new Brian and I.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.782
Good heavens, good heavens.

00:03:38.842 --> 00:03:40.605
Where did you buy groceries and clothing?

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:49.116
There was something called Orr's and then it became Piggly Orr's and as far as I know until Safeway came in here, I don't think there was anything.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.120
And we just had, we did what we could.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.702
I think that there was a,

00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:58.844
There was a meat, a store where they had, Reed Fields didn't exist back then.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.850
But there was a mom and pop grocery downtown.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.312
I didn't get that far.

00:04:05.452 --> 00:04:08.616
I did all my shopping at Orr's because it wasn't far away.

00:04:09.177 --> 00:04:11.380
Where did you shop for clothing and other things?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.562
Oh, I guess we always went to Houston then.

00:04:14.023 --> 00:04:14.404
Okay.

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:15.185
Yeah, right.

00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:21.833
And where did y'all, if you were going to go out to eat, a special meal where?

00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:29.383
What was the place that you got catfish on University Drive?

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.265
I'm trying to remember what the name of that was.

00:04:32.347 --> 00:04:34.610
I can't remember it.

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:38.115
But it was in a, everybody went there.

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.499
If you were going to have catfish, they went there.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:47.449
But I don't remember any other, really, there wasn't any place for a very long time.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:56.160
Then we had a McDonald's and my children celebrated with it when that McDonald's came in.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.105
So we had quite a few McDonald's for a while for a quick meal.

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:07.053
What were your early opinions about the community in terms of law and order and safety and so forth?

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:11.499
Well, we've had some bad experiences but this wasn't just when we first came here.

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.121
We've had two break-ins.

00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:14.823
Really?

00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:16.525
Yeah.

00:05:18.378 --> 00:05:22.265
One was when Bob was out of town and I was working.

00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:27.814
And I came home after 10 at night, one of my working night.

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:33.103
And I thought the door was a little bit ajar.

00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:36.990
And I came in the house, and it was shambles.

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:42.900
Well, I didn't know whether I should be in the house or not, but I called the police.

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:48.392
And then I thought, well, I'd better close the door, because I left the door open.

00:05:48.492 --> 00:05:50.658
Well, what had happened, they took the door off the hinges.

00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:56.091
So when I went to close the door, it came out, and there was this crash.

00:05:56.532 --> 00:05:59.539
And I almost fainted.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:10.836
Bob had a very valuable greener shotgun that some patient had given my grandfather.

00:06:10.856 --> 00:06:12.137
My grandfather was a doctor.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:18.867
He had a very valuable gun, but they also took the greener and one of the old shotguns.

00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:22.152
Whatever it was, it wasn't valuable.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.356
And then they got a little bit of jewelry.

00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:31.026
Now the other break-in I had was sometime, it probably was somebody who was working in the house or doing something.

00:06:31.928 --> 00:06:41.543
They took all my flat silver that was in a case that was in a fake drawer underneath the chest that I had it in.

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.566
I came to have a dinner party.

00:06:44.035 --> 00:06:46.758
I took out the chest and it was empty.

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:50.602
And I don't know when that was taken.

00:06:50.622 --> 00:06:51.383
I have no idea.

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.306
But those are the times that we had.

00:06:54.386 --> 00:06:57.689
And of course, in the early days, nobody locked their doors.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.231
We didn't lock our doors here.

00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:03.215
And of course, we wouldn't think of not doing it anymore.

00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:12.405
But I think my friends tell me that as you get toward downtown Bryan,

00:07:12.824 --> 00:07:18.790
It's very, they're having a very serious problem with people who live in that older neighborhood down there.

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:27.018
All right, in those early months and years, was it difficult for a newcomer to be accepted?

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:34.786
Well, I suppose everybody, you know, people still talk about O'Brien and that O'Brien still exists.

00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:39.591
The heirs of those people are still here and they are, some of them,

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:43.000
Not all, but being in the Women's Club, I know who they are.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.463
Some of them are very nice and very gracious.

00:07:45.643 --> 00:07:49.389
Others of them are still impressed with being O'Brien.

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:51.772
So, you know, just like any organization.

00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:54.216
But for you and your husband?

00:07:54.236 --> 00:07:56.659
Yeah, well, we were certainly accepted here, you know.

00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.183
All right, back on the campus.

00:07:59.872 --> 00:08:06.581
The search that led to Irene Hoadley came, when was that, in the 70s?

00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:07.663
It was in the 70s.

00:08:08.023 --> 00:08:18.818
It must have been early 70s because Jack Smith was here in 1969 when our son died.

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:24.546
And I have thought afterwards that I could never have survived

00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:30.548
here if Jack Smith hadn't been here and been so considerate and all of that.

00:08:30.628 --> 00:08:49.133
Because he was just one of those wonderful, thoughtful, now maybe he couldn't have coped with the university growth and all that, but at least he would have made an effort and would have been loved and respected always by our library staff.

00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:52.457
And we were all very sad when he left.

00:08:53.787 --> 00:08:59.917
Now, in terms of Irene Hoadley, I think she missed her calling.

00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:03.062
She should have been a plant manager someplace.

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:06.208
Describe, as you recall, the search process.

00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:08.792
The search process,

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:12.483
There were several, their final candidates.

00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:19.333
One was a black candidate from, was it Tennessee or someplace, and Irene Hoadley.

00:09:19.353 --> 00:09:21.697
And then I don't know who the other candidate was.

00:09:21.777 --> 00:09:22.779
I think there were three.

00:09:22.819 --> 00:09:25.643
There usually are three in this kind of thing.

00:09:28.728 --> 00:09:29.970
Very early on.

00:09:31.098 --> 00:09:38.052
we got the feeling that she had everybody pegged, you know, what they were capable of, what they were doing.

00:09:38.734 --> 00:09:39.956
She...

00:09:40.878 --> 00:09:41.900
But back on the search.

00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:42.962
Back on the search.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:49.275
Do you remember who the, was there a favorite among the library staff of those finalists?

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:51.075
I don't know that.

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:52.778
I can't say.

00:09:52.818 --> 00:10:05.203
My friend, my good black friend, Helen Britton, whom I talked to the other day, she may have thought that Irene, she had known Irene before.

00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:08.710
She may have been, she was on the search committee, as I remember.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.415
But I don't remember who else was on the search committee.

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:13.618
So she knew a whole lot.

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:19.406
All right, let me add to the student typist, add this as an editorial note.

00:10:20.388 --> 00:10:23.552
I was the chairman of that search committee as dean of faculties.

00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:29.100
And when made the final report to Vice President Calhoun,

00:10:30.076 --> 00:10:40.849
I and others on the committee thought that the black finalist was probably the best person in terms of experience and capability and so forth.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:53.485
He had been the number two man at the University of Houston, and wherever he was at that point, he was doing very, very well, and we found nothing but very positive things.

00:10:53.465 --> 00:11:05.341
Dr. Calhoun thought that it would be appropriate for us to hire a woman in what was then the first significant leadership position here on the campus.

00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:06.822
And so he said, let's hire her.

00:11:07.624 --> 00:11:14.352
The black finalist was hired a year later, I believe, at either Dartmouth or Brown as the director of libraries.

00:11:14.392 --> 00:11:17.937
So he certainly demonstrated that he had the capability.

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:19.903
End of note.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:30.913
Do you remember her first, when she first arrived, her first impressions and so forth?

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:37.073
Well, I guess the closest thing, it's a slang expression, cool cat would come to mind.

00:11:37.354 --> 00:11:38.315
Cool cat.

00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:39.056
Cool cat.

00:11:39.196 --> 00:11:42.459
Cool cat.

00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:49.908
This is the time that you remember that computers were coming in big time.

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:56.395
She wanted to have all of that, but

00:11:57.573 --> 00:12:03.983
She did not provide for the maintenance, the money for the maintenance.

00:12:04.003 --> 00:12:09.512
She did not add, she did not factor that in to her management structure at all.

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:12.277
She just wanted to have state of the arts, in quotes.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:13.679
That's fine.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:24.036
But you, within those days, and it's even true now, if you don't have, you don't have the maintenance for this, if you don't have the software

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:26.986
updates for this, you're not going to get very far.

00:12:27.627 --> 00:12:32.978
I can remember years that we had the dumb terminals sitting out over in the computer center.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.042
No money to repair them.

00:12:35.944 --> 00:12:40.573
Now the faculty and the students were all screaming bloody murder.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.843
But it had not been factored in.

00:12:43.104 --> 00:12:46.329
Now that would not happen in this day and age, of course.

00:12:47.071 --> 00:13:00.494
But any library director will have to always factor in a huge amount for your updates, all your software and your hardware, because the hardware will wear out.

00:13:01.075 --> 00:13:05.683
When she first arrived, who were the key members of her staff after she?

00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:11.600
Well, I think that Evelyn King, Dr. King was her head of public services.

00:13:12.982 --> 00:13:17.509
And let's see, who was, I don't think she was yet.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:20.834
I think that maybe Henry Osmeyer was head of public services.

00:13:20.995 --> 00:13:21.716
I'm trying to remember.

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:23.739
That's a little hazy back then.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.423
But one of them.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:32.320
Anyway, and I don't know who was head of technical services back at that point in time.

00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:36.647
Did you professionals have regular meetings with her?

00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:41.155
Only once a year for our annual evaluation.

00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:44.361
There wasn't a staff meeting of the key?

00:13:44.763 --> 00:13:47.669
The staff, well, yes, she would.

00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:59.093
But she was a great one for keeping the pot always boiling, having whatever these management techniques are, whether that's deeds assessment or

00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:08.802
management by objectives or participative management, whatever those things are, somewhere the buck has to stop.

00:14:09.803 --> 00:14:15.811
And she always took care of it that the buck would stop with somebody else.

00:14:16.551 --> 00:14:21.958
Well, that eventually did catch up with her in later years, but she got by with it for a long time.

00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:29.783
All right, now, in terms of the higher administration, when you first got here, Earl Rudder was the president.

00:14:30.024 --> 00:14:30.304
Yes.

00:14:30.864 --> 00:14:31.185
Did you?

00:14:31.445 --> 00:14:34.908
But I did not know President Rudder.

00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:38.111
And I remember, this is a little off.

00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:40.394
I'll sort of digress.

00:14:41.134 --> 00:14:51.945
I knew what it was really like is when it was Earl Rudder's funeral, and they had that memorial.

00:14:52.313 --> 00:15:07.943
over at G. Raleigh, and lo and behold, there was Lyndon Johnson and John Connolly, and they were in their academic robes, but they were coming from two sides, and when they got together,

00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:12.441
they put their arms around her and I said, now I know what this is all about.

00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:15.466
Finally, I figured it out.

00:15:16.287 --> 00:15:19.892
But it was, it was, I'll never forget that as long as I live.

00:15:19.912 --> 00:15:26.202
Did you and your colleagues have any perception of whether or not he was concerned about the library?

00:15:26.502 --> 00:15:27.223
Did you all see him?

00:15:27.243 --> 00:15:27.344
No.

00:15:27.364 --> 00:15:27.985
Oh, heavens no.

00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:34.234
You know, that was far beyond our, our, what we were thinking of at that point in time.

00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:44.688
Did you, in those early years, did you and your colleagues ever have any special requests from some board member or politician or notable former student?

00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:46.811
Not that I can remember.

00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:48.172
Nobody came over and demanded something?

00:15:48.192 --> 00:15:50.274
Nobody came over and demanded something immediately.

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:53.077
Well, if they had, it wouldn't be on our level.

00:15:53.138 --> 00:15:58.163
We'd have to ask someone else to take care of this.

00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:05.116
And there were no notable library physical problems of a fire, tornado?

00:16:05.136 --> 00:16:10.428
Well we all, well we had, there was always some leakage in this building.

00:16:10.488 --> 00:16:14.717
I'm sure that they have since remedied all of that.

00:16:14.697 --> 00:16:16.861
But there were some serious leakage.

00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:20.306
If we'd have heavy storms, the stacks could get.

00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:21.789
It was just a big leak.

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:22.831
I can't remember.

00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:29.902
It was over by, close by, where documents came in to where we came into this building from Cushing.

00:16:29.962 --> 00:16:34.149
And during those early years, your place of duty.

00:16:34.891 --> 00:16:40.620
My place of duty, I was first, I was

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.534
as I said, when I first came, I was in the old Cushing.

00:16:44.554 --> 00:16:55.184
When we moved over here, Dr. Jackson was head of, Kathy Jackson, who is still here, was head of sciences and technology.

00:16:55.585 --> 00:16:57.827
This is divisional reference.

00:16:57.847 --> 00:17:07.917
I was, I think Henry Alsmeyer was head for a little while of social sciences, and then I became the head, and that's when I think he became assistant director.

00:17:08.657 --> 00:17:10.219
There came a time

00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:20.690
I can't even remember what his exact role, but because he and Evelyn overlapped in some way, and I can't tell you what that overlap was.

00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:24.614
But we were fortunate to have Evelyn King as a buffer.

00:17:24.634 --> 00:17:30.501
When you first went to work, your place of duty was in the big second floor reference room?

00:17:30.621 --> 00:17:34.286
Yeah, we were in centralized reference over there.

00:17:34.746 --> 00:17:37.489
And then we moved to the science intake.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.632
Well, I think that...

00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:48.062
They had wanted the first floor of this building to be an undergraduate collection.

00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:52.968
Then on second floor, it was documents, government documents.

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:54.970
And it isn't as it is now.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.093
And it's spread between social sciences and sciences.

00:17:58.154 --> 00:17:59.956
Now that's what the documents people are.

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:04.000
But at that time, it was all one division.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:13.322
Third floor, we were on third floor with social sciences and humanities, and on fourth floor there was science and technology.

00:18:14.304 --> 00:18:19.071
When you first became an administrator, describe your responsibilities.

00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:23.257
Well, mostly to keep the show running.

00:18:23.717 --> 00:18:32.350
That was in the early days when you had to do the staffing, and the staffing was pretty meager.

00:18:32.937 --> 00:18:37.162
classified staff was doing just every bit as much as the other staff.

00:18:37.202 --> 00:18:37.923
As the professionals?

00:18:37.943 --> 00:18:39.586
Yes, as the professionals.

00:18:40.026 --> 00:18:42.830
And where did you recruit the professionals?

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.991
Where did they prepare?

00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:44.772
Where did they train?

00:18:45.012 --> 00:18:57.268
Well, they trained, actually training is just sort of like throwing them in the lion pit is what, because we didn't have time to do in-depth training like they do now.

00:18:57.849 --> 00:18:59.451
Did they have library degrees though?

00:18:59.768 --> 00:19:07.956
Yeah, not with the classified staff, of course, but the professionals that came in, who came in.

00:19:08.915 --> 00:19:16.066
One of the early ones was the young man, Charles, who was head of the friends group here.

00:19:16.086 --> 00:19:16.346
Schultz?

00:19:16.787 --> 00:19:17.568
Natch, no.

00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:23.057
He's head of the Evans friends has been Charles.

00:19:23.077 --> 00:19:25.160
I can't remember his name.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:33.032
Well, anyway, somebody who came in later was Charles Gilreath, and he started working for me in social sciences, and he was the one

00:19:33.265 --> 00:19:37.250
who started the first online service that we had.

00:19:37.731 --> 00:19:38.612
He developed that.

00:19:38.772 --> 00:19:39.633
That was his baby.

00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:41.856
And there was very primitive days.

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:46.122
There were very primitive demos for onlines.

00:19:46.162 --> 00:19:55.514
We used to, even when, for many years, we were just jerry-rigging all of our equipment, plugs, cords, moving it around.

00:19:55.574 --> 00:20:02.243
Now, of course, they have these lovely rooms where every student can have a computer.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.575
Everybody learns everything that they can do online.

00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:10.381
This is more like a different world.

00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:16.990
Do you remember any anecdotes from the early computer days, either amusing or serious?

00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:19.653
Not really.

00:20:20.174 --> 00:20:30.728
But you would have frequent power outages because there was just too much electronics loaded in our part of the

00:20:31.687 --> 00:20:36.416
Well, our part, our library is what I'm trying to say.

00:20:36.977 --> 00:20:38.200
Not just any one unit.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.384
There was just too much loaded.

00:20:40.825 --> 00:20:42.768
And of course, that has all been taken care of.

00:20:42.869 --> 00:20:45.834
And I don't doubt if you have any power outages.

00:20:45.874 --> 00:20:50.944
But when I hear about the people in California having power outages, you know that.

00:20:50.924 --> 00:21:00.680
And then you'd have to be very careful about power surges as it came back on because that would wipe out all your material.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.384
So, you know, it's a different world out here.

00:21:03.524 --> 00:21:05.467
When you became an administrator.

00:21:05.668 --> 00:21:06.589
Well, way back when.

00:21:07.731 --> 00:21:11.898
What advice and counsel did you try to give to new staff members?

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:15.784
What did I try to do?

00:21:17.772 --> 00:21:26.427
I don't remember that I gave any words of advice because, very honestly, I was a much better Indian than I was a chief.

00:21:27.208 --> 00:21:36.684
I probably was too kind-hearted to be a serious administrator.

00:21:36.845 --> 00:21:39.069
And I could do it.

00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:41.653
And the last couple of years, I was working.

00:21:41.954 --> 00:21:48.883
maybe within the last four to six years, I was acting head of documents.

00:21:49.604 --> 00:21:51.146
And the documents I knew very little.

00:21:51.206 --> 00:21:52.087
I learned a lot.

00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:59.777
And I'm sorry, that's one of the regrets that I have, is that I didn't learn the documents earlier.

00:21:59.837 --> 00:22:03.762
Instead of just trying to react to them, I should have proacted.

00:22:04.042 --> 00:22:06.966
That terminology isn't very good.

00:22:06.946 --> 00:22:12.574
But that's about what I should have been in there, because I found it fascinating and I really enjoyed it.

00:22:13.175 --> 00:22:17.381
But then, of course, there were always staff problems.

00:22:17.401 --> 00:22:19.464
Wherever you went, there were going to be staff problems.

00:22:20.826 --> 00:22:22.388
That's the name of the game.

00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:28.156
In the 60s and 70s, were we paying competitive salaries?

00:22:28.576 --> 00:22:28.997
Not then.

00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:29.818
You did later.

00:22:30.199 --> 00:22:33.223
You did later, but you didn't during that time.

00:22:33.608 --> 00:22:39.043
Mr. Runner died, and you mentioned the memorial service.

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:43.755
Then a few months later, Jack Williams is hired.

00:22:44.638 --> 00:22:47.044
Do you remember any impressions of him?

00:22:48.003 --> 00:22:48.685
early on?

00:22:48.725 --> 00:22:49.827
Did you all see him ever?

00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:51.731
I don't know.

00:22:51.972 --> 00:22:52.513
We didn't see him.

00:22:52.533 --> 00:22:55.480
I don't remember ever seeing President Rutter in the library.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:03.137
We could have seen, I don't know, I'm not sure that we ever did see Jack Williams unless he was coming over to give a speech or something.

00:23:03.398 --> 00:23:04.079
I don't know that.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.843
What about, and then Calhoun?

00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:08.590
And Dr. Calhoun had enough people.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.114
I don't know.

00:23:11.154 --> 00:23:12.956
He probably was over here, too.

00:23:14.538 --> 00:23:15.860
Trying to think of who.

00:23:16.521 --> 00:23:26.435
I mean, really, and truly, in our bailiwick, I would see English and history faculty more than I would see any administrators.

00:23:26.955 --> 00:23:31.001
Because administrators could have their gophers come over here and get what they needed.

00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:34.125
And that would save them hours of time.

00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:36.067
This also, I'm digressing.

00:23:36.627 --> 00:23:43.333
Nobody hated to have the card catalog go as much as Milton Nance.

00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:45.035
Now, everybody has Milton Nance stories.

00:23:45.135 --> 00:23:45.615
I know that.

00:23:45.715 --> 00:23:46.696
Please share some, though.

00:23:46.716 --> 00:23:56.185
But he, I mean, every time he would come in and that online catalog was on, he refused to learn how to use it.

00:23:56.925 --> 00:23:58.767
Absolutely refused.

00:23:58.787 --> 00:24:04.112
And he would fuss, and he would, oh, he was just, he was a most unhappy gentleman.

00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:18.152
And I look back, you know, and every time he'd start, well, the staff would say, well, Dr. Nance is here, so I would have to go out and sort of try to pacify this because, you know, it isn't fair to take this out on.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.526
on your staff, particularly since it was ongoing.

00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:25.611
It was just a constant badgering.

00:24:26.012 --> 00:24:28.916
Who were some of the favorite library user?

00:24:29.317 --> 00:24:37.349
Well, of course, you're high on that list, and Garland Bayless is one, and Victor Treat.

00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:39.272
You're all of our favorites.

00:24:39.913 --> 00:24:43.178
Another favorite, and of course, someone that I like

00:24:43.613 --> 00:24:50.824
in the faculty, and Betty, Betty was wonderful to all of us.

00:24:51.605 --> 00:24:56.893
She was, and we really wanted to help her and to do anything that she wanted to do.

00:24:56.953 --> 00:24:58.335
She was really, really great.

00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:01.740
And somebody I helped a lot was Sarah Alpern.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.346
with some of her research.

00:25:05.987 --> 00:25:09.754
And you were just really wanting to help.

00:25:09.854 --> 00:25:13.080
It's so easy to help people when they're kind and considerate.

00:25:13.981 --> 00:25:15.104
It's when they're difficult.

00:25:15.384 --> 00:25:22.497
And I don't say that all the difficult people are in science and technology.

00:25:22.915 --> 00:25:34.753
The people I dealt with in the liberal arts and in the social sciences were not all, but for the most part were much more gracious to deal with than some of the people on the other side.

00:25:35.053 --> 00:25:37.457
So, you know, that's just my personal opinion.

00:25:37.877 --> 00:25:44.527
Do you remember any goofy things that a faculty member wanted you all to get for them or find for them?

00:25:44.547 --> 00:25:50.897
I don't think so that I did, but I bet someone like, I remember,

00:25:51.637 --> 00:26:07.789
I remember actually, we're going to get around to some of these people, but I don't remember anything in our particular area that anybody wanted that we couldn't actually find.

00:26:08.022 --> 00:26:11.667
I don't remember any goofy things that happened like that.

00:26:12.268 --> 00:26:13.369
But I'm sure there might have been.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:19.037
And people working at nights, sometimes you get interesting things happen in the library.

00:26:19.097 --> 00:26:23.262
You might not have even been here.

00:26:23.302 --> 00:26:24.204
You might have been away then.

00:26:24.264 --> 00:26:27.768
But we had a spell of streaking in the library.

00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:33.877
That mean these nude people would come roaring through, and everybody would get all upset.

00:26:34.277 --> 00:26:36.460
We had one Vietnam veteran.

00:26:36.912 --> 00:26:38.115
You probably heard this story.

00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:40.041
This is one of the most famous stories of all.

00:26:40.703 --> 00:26:46.078
He resented anybody in the library or anybody anywhere that who was wearing

00:26:46.295 --> 00:27:07.341
sandals so this gentleman had a pair of pliers and was running around pinching toes so we called him the toe biter and you know he obviously had had some emotional problems and he was you know not long not long for the university but it was you know everybody made a big big to do about this was this both male and female toes

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.944
I think them, but just male toes as far as I remember.

00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:12.426
It was just male toes.

00:27:12.506 --> 00:27:15.210
The Streakers, were they co-educational?

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.772
I would guess that they probably were.

00:27:17.733 --> 00:27:19.035
Mostly male-o.

00:27:19.796 --> 00:27:27.726
But you know, if people were over here sleeping in the library, no telling what was going on over here.

00:27:29.005 --> 00:27:34.351
Did you all, on occasion, you did find some sleepers in the morning when you came in?

00:27:34.371 --> 00:27:35.172
Oh, yes.

00:27:35.232 --> 00:27:39.357
The security staff would find them and try to get them out.

00:27:39.918 --> 00:27:41.380
I don't think they always got them out.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.743
I mean, there are plenty of places where people could easily find them.

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:45.885
I don't know if that's true now.

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:52.052
It looks to me like you have pretty well, it's open, it's a lot more open and there aren't any nooks and crannies here and there.

00:27:52.092 --> 00:27:58.860
Do you remember any obvious physical damage that anybody did?

00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:07.981
I did hear that there was some, you know, and there were still the people who would take a book and, you know, razors.

00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:10.585
Those people will always be around and about.

00:28:11.186 --> 00:28:15.834
And you just, you would just have, you would just get a microfilm.

00:28:15.934 --> 00:28:17.136
But no piles of books on the floor?

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:19.600
No, I don't remember anything like that.

00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:23.987
They would have been picked up pretty fast anyway by the shelvers.

00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:29.707
If they had found them, they would just think that some student was doing something.

00:28:29.887 --> 00:28:32.090
Were there student employees in your earliest days?

00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:34.853
Yeah, I think we've always had student employees.

00:28:36.895 --> 00:28:37.937
How important are they?

00:28:38.037 --> 00:28:39.178
Well, they're very important.

00:28:39.278 --> 00:28:41.060
They're like the classified staff.

00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:54.396
The whole thing just depends on a whole lot of interacting individuals of all ages doing their job.

00:28:54.815 --> 00:29:06.671
Is that, looking back on it, is that employment for those students, is that good for them perhaps professionally in the future?

00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:15.744
I think that some of our students went on to, someone, I think several people have established student scholarships here.

00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:21.812
And I think one was, I'm trying to remember, oh he's the nicest man, he was our doorman.

00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:24.636
And his wife worked for Cash and Kane.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:35.024
And he gave considerable, he gave his annuity, he bequeathed his annuity for student scholarships.

00:29:35.465 --> 00:29:37.728
And that was a wonderful thing for him to do.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:47.242
And I think several of them, I think Pixie, the girl who's now in charge of all the computers, I think she was our student assistant.

00:29:47.262 --> 00:29:53.931
I'm trying to think of some of the other, I don't know of anybody that's still here who would have been a student assistant, but she comes to mind.

00:29:54.721 --> 00:29:58.246
And she was working for an engineering firm.

00:29:58.306 --> 00:30:02.272
She at least had a, she may have a PhD in engineering for all I know.

00:30:02.332 --> 00:30:06.198
But then she was working for a firm and then decided that she wanted to come back.

00:30:06.238 --> 00:30:13.489
And then she took her library degree and came back here and has worked her way up into what she's doing.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:19.568
When you first got here, most of the students would have been male.

00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.530
That's right.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.132
And then gradually it became .

00:30:22.152 --> 00:30:22.172
.

00:30:22.192 --> 00:30:22.212
.

00:30:22.232 --> 00:30:22.853
Yes, gradually.

00:30:23.635 --> 00:30:31.427
What was the difference in having an almost entirely male student body using the library and a group of male and female?

00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:41.539
Well, I think you're more conscious of just the fact that you've got all, you know, both male and female in here.

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:49.470
I don't think when we were, when we first started with almost completely male group that we, they were in here to do, you know, they were in here to study.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.272
They were in here to get, do their research.

00:30:51.556 --> 00:31:05.092
When the women came in, I think, you know, as all parents know, what's going on here with all of the... That's just natural for somebody to think about it.

00:31:05.192 --> 00:31:09.417
But anyway, I don't think actually a lot of...

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:17.547
It may be, too, that when the women came in, this might have been a place for them to kind of relax.
