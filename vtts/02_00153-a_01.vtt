WEBVTT

00:06.106 --> 00:14.294
Well, testing one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four testing.

00:16.536 --> 00:20.280
This is Monday the 18th, Monday the 18th.

00:21.421 --> 00:22.702
This is Monday the 18th.

00:24.724 --> 00:35.455
June 18, year 2000, have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Dr. Jarvis Miller about his student experiences here at Texas A&M.

00:36.278 --> 00:50.055
To begin with, please introduce yourself to this tape and anyone that might listen to it or read a transcription, describe family background, where'd you grow up, mom and dad, what they do, where'd you go to high school and so forth.

00:51.937 --> 00:52.898
I'm Jarvis Miller.

00:54.020 --> 00:59.967
I'm from Orange Grove, a small town in South Texas, 35 miles west of Corpus Christi.

01:01.109 --> 01:03.872
My high school graduating class had 16 in it.

01:04.679 --> 01:12.407
We didn't have chemistry or physics or calculus, so I came to A&M with some disadvantage.

01:13.868 --> 01:24.879
My parents or my family, early settlers in the area, the first came there in 1852, Corpus Christi.

01:27.582 --> 01:33.167
These were the parents of my great grandparents on my grandmother's side, grandmother Miller's side.

01:34.767 --> 01:44.160
My grandfather Miller came there in 1856 from North Carolina, settled on the New Asus River.

01:46.823 --> 01:56.376
My, one of his sons, my great uncle, Dimry B. Miller, attended A&M in the 1890s.

01:59.380 --> 02:03.205
And while he didn't graduate, he considered himself an Aggie.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.597
My dad was one of four brothers.

02:10.021 --> 02:23.305
His other three brothers attended the University of Texas, and he was the only Aggie in the group, so he took a lot of kidding over the years.

02:25.028 --> 02:29.496
My mother had been a high school English and Spanish teacher.

02:31.282 --> 02:35.549
And I was, or I, yes, I was their first child.

02:37.091 --> 02:49.592
Grew up on the ranch in South Texas, pretty idyllic in many ways, horses, cattle, the wide open spaces, freedom.

02:53.498 --> 02:56.563
And then World War II came.

02:58.417 --> 03:16.424
My father had missed World War I and I should add he graduated from A&M in the class of 1926, majored in animal husbandry, came back to the ranch and took over its operation upon graduation.

03:18.887 --> 03:20.830
As I say in World War II he

03:21.940 --> 03:33.057
while he had every reason not to go, volunteered in 1942, went into the Navy and we got to travel.

03:33.558 --> 03:39.747
It was a real blessing for me because I was in junior high school

03:40.840 --> 03:51.157
We got to live a while in Miami, in San Francisco, Princeton, New Jersey, and Pacific Grove, California.

03:52.539 --> 03:57.407
So those were enriching experiences at a good time in my life.

03:58.589 --> 04:00.773
Interestingly enough, coming from

04:01.698 --> 04:10.810
rural school in South Texas, I never felt at a disadvantage in any of those school systems and did well.

04:12.493 --> 04:25.090
One of the things I regretted was that at Aptos Junior High School in San Francisco, my best friend was Robert

04:26.690 --> 04:30.663
Oh, grandfather had founded the Bank of America, Giannini.

04:32.348 --> 04:37.324
And I wish I'd kept up the relationship there over the years.

04:37.726 --> 04:42.035
But that was a very enriching experience.

04:42.055 --> 04:57.928
And also, with Dad gone, I, at a young age, had some responsibilities on the farm and ranch that stood me in good stead in terms of management and so forth.

04:57.908 --> 05:03.718
So I had an interesting and a rich life before coming to A&M.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.280
You finished high school in what year?

05:05.761 --> 05:05.881
1946.

05:05.901 --> 05:06.663
1946.

05:09.568 --> 05:12.212
Had you visited A&M before coming up?

05:12.713 --> 05:13.314
Only once.

05:14.095 --> 05:16.079
What was your impression?

05:16.099 --> 05:23.511
Well, in 1939, Dad brought us to a football game.

05:24.875 --> 05:28.720
It was quite an experience for a kid from South Texas.

05:31.864 --> 05:40.676
He hadn't made any hotel reservations, so we ended up spending the night at a fleabag hotel in Navasota.

05:40.916 --> 05:44.841
I remember how upset my mother was about that.

05:45.462 --> 05:54.594
But the Corps of Cadets and all of it was very impressive for, as I say, a young kid from the country in South Texas.

05:54.614 --> 06:02.345
As far as you were aware, before you came to enroll, what was A&M's quality, its strengths?

06:02.766 --> 06:05.509
What kind of school was it as far as you knew then?

06:07.692 --> 06:14.862
Well, of course, my blood had always been maroon, and interestingly enough, my dad

06:16.023 --> 06:19.289
wanted me to try for Harvard or Yale or Princeton.

06:21.874 --> 06:25.241
But I, as I say, my blood was too maroon.

06:25.261 --> 06:31.753
And in my view, A&M was the preeminent institution in the state.

06:31.733 --> 06:38.067
Aside from the liberal arts, of course, the University of Texas was looked at as being premier there.

06:39.309 --> 06:42.997
But I intended to study agriculture and I wanted to go back to the ranch at the time.

06:43.578 --> 06:47.146
Describe, when you came up to enroll, describe that trip.

06:47.246 --> 06:47.787
Who came?

06:47.847 --> 06:49.050
What did you bring?

06:51.545 --> 07:06.149
Well, I came with two friends from a neighboring community that we went to church with, and one of their parents brought us, three of us came, and they just brought us and dumped us.

07:07.892 --> 07:11.258
And I remember running into sophomores,

07:13.263 --> 07:18.368
very first day, and that put the fear of God into us.

07:18.728 --> 07:20.549
Now this was September of?

07:20.569 --> 07:21.550
1946.

07:22.451 --> 07:27.756
And what did you, physically, what did you bring with you?

07:28.937 --> 07:34.322
Well, the contents of a footlocker, and that was about it.

07:34.962 --> 07:41.548
I had an electric fan that my dad had used when he had spent a summer here.

07:43.233 --> 07:53.285
and not much clothing other than underwear because we knew we were going to be buying clothes here or being issued clothes here.

07:55.107 --> 08:04.819
But the first two sophomores we ran into were Pat Hall, you may remember, class of 49, and Jim Stegall.

08:05.542 --> 08:07.847
And they were fearsome sophomores.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.733
They put the fear of God into us.

08:11.615 --> 08:19.652
How did you find out where you were assigned in terms of an outfit and your dormitory and so forth?

08:20.780 --> 08:22.041
I don't really remember.

08:22.442 --> 08:24.685
I guess, well, we knew when we came.

08:25.526 --> 08:29.791
They'd told us ahead of time, so we knew where to come and where to go.

08:31.052 --> 08:38.301
But the porters who brought us turned around and left as soon as we were unloaded, so we were completely on our own.

08:38.961 --> 08:42.385
Where did you end up in what dorm?

08:42.405 --> 08:47.952
Dorm 12, third floor, D Company Infantry.

08:48.472 --> 08:53.237
Do you have any idea how it was, why it was infantry for you instead of something else?

08:54.499 --> 08:55.400
Was it luck of the draw?

08:56.421 --> 08:57.963
No, I guess I didn't specify.

08:59.184 --> 09:00.205
That was probably it.

09:01.406 --> 09:10.917
Although the Air Force ROTC unit was started in the, at midterm and I transferred there in January.

09:11.197 --> 09:18.225
What kind of advice did you get from parents or friends or other family before you came?

09:21.040 --> 09:23.442
I don't remember really getting any.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.726
I just always assumed I was coming to A&M.

09:27.747 --> 09:29.489
But they didn't say work hard or?

09:30.390 --> 09:38.858
No, I think they assumed they'd done a good enough job raising me that they didn't have to worry about that.

09:38.878 --> 09:45.225
What were the impressive physical features of the campus when you first got here?

09:46.184 --> 10:11.450
Well, being a foot the size and having to go retrieve a footlocker from the Railway Express down at the train station and carry it back to the dorm in the steaming weather of September, then having to go get footlockers for upperclassmen.

10:12.771 --> 10:15.634
Describe those first days as a fish.

10:16.137 --> 10:33.603
Well, the first week we had only the sophomores with us and so they started off immediately putting a fear of God into us, threatening us with everything under the sun, scaring us out of our skins.

10:35.666 --> 10:43.377
And what were some of the, were there any things they did in the privacy of darkness or?

10:45.128 --> 10:49.834
Did they lecture you, stand you in the hall, or what?

10:49.854 --> 11:04.493
All kinds of lecture and, excuse me, having to stand at attention and learning how to whip out and meet upperclassmen and learning the rules and learning campusology, all of that kind of thing.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.475
And your outfit have a nickname?

11:07.377 --> 11:08.017
D. Spiders.

11:09.299 --> 11:10.080
Why do you know?

11:10.781 --> 11:13.144
I don't know.

11:13.242 --> 11:17.852
What did the upperclassmen say was special about D spiders?

11:19.807 --> 11:21.709
There must have been some pride.

11:21.729 --> 11:29.038
I think pride of being tough, being hard on the freshmen.

11:29.058 --> 11:30.440
That's about all I remember.

11:32.623 --> 11:37.108
And then you go to the dining hall, describe the room.

11:37.128 --> 11:37.328
Excuse me.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.151
Jimmy Woodall was a freshman with me.

11:39.211 --> 11:40.853
We were in D Company together.

11:41.293 --> 11:42.234
Where was his hometown?

11:42.455 --> 11:42.975
Fort Worth.

11:43.095 --> 11:43.536
Fort Worth.

11:44.663 --> 11:49.709
Describe going into the dining hall and the routines there for a freshman.

11:50.730 --> 11:53.553
Well, that was part of what we had to learn that first week.

11:54.895 --> 12:09.591
Sit on the edge of our chairs, sit at attention, eat square meals, learn the names for the food, how to pass food to upperclassmen.

12:10.567 --> 12:16.136
We'd have waited until all the upperclassmen were served, stuff like that.

12:16.156 --> 12:20.363
Now were there some upperclassmen, well wait, this is just sophomores.

12:23.348 --> 12:32.423
Were there any sophomores that you soon realized were special, either by their self-appointment or in fact were special in your outfit?

12:36.908 --> 12:42.516
Well, some, yeah, it's just the variation of human nature.

12:44.720 --> 13:00.283
One of the ones, I guess I wasn't considered a very good freshman, so I got to be the maid for a couple of sophomores, but one of whom was a Jew, Eric Gottlieb.

13:01.597 --> 13:04.584
His family died in the Holocaust.

13:04.604 --> 13:06.788
A lot of his family died in the Holocaust.

13:07.630 --> 13:08.552
He was from Houston.

13:10.076 --> 13:17.091
And he was a funny little guy.

13:18.151 --> 13:23.283
He acted tough on the surface, but he wasn't at all tough like some of them were.

13:23.884 --> 13:27.453
Now you said made, you mean that you were to go in and make up his?

13:27.934 --> 13:29.217
Oh yes, clean up their rooms.

13:29.618 --> 13:31.823
Yes, we freshmen had to.

13:32.714 --> 13:37.499
clean up the rooms of our upperclassmen, make their beds, straighten the rooms, everything.

13:37.539 --> 13:39.200
And how long did that duty last?

13:39.921 --> 13:40.342
Oh, a year.

13:40.642 --> 13:41.002
Oh, a year.

13:41.563 --> 13:46.528
And so yours was to take care of that sophomore's room or were there other rooms too?

13:47.008 --> 13:47.669
No, just one.

13:47.889 --> 13:48.310
Just one.

13:48.330 --> 13:50.692
Just one.

13:50.712 --> 13:56.157
And later did he indicate appreciation for your efforts?

13:56.237 --> 13:56.438
No.

13:56.718 --> 13:59.100
No, none of them did.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.882
It was expected.

14:01.655 --> 14:06.501
I should add that the two hometown buddies that came with me dropped out after six weeks.

14:06.781 --> 14:06.981
Really?

14:07.862 --> 14:10.586
And so that was, that was a real shock.

14:11.467 --> 14:14.490
What, looking back on it, why did they drop out?

14:15.351 --> 14:16.412
They just didn't want to take it.

14:17.153 --> 14:17.313
Okay.

14:17.814 --> 14:18.555
As freshmen.

14:18.575 --> 14:19.917
Did they transfer somewhere else?

14:22.480 --> 14:22.860
Yes.

14:23.741 --> 14:27.966
I think one went to Southwest Texas and one went to A&I.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.802
Did you ever think about dropping out?

14:30.822 --> 14:30.982
No.

14:31.382 --> 14:32.043
I knew I couldn't.

14:32.704 --> 14:35.647
Dad, I couldn't face my dad.

14:37.168 --> 14:45.897
As soon after you arrived, how long was it before you wrote a letter or called home to tell them what was going on?

14:46.177 --> 14:55.086
Well, I couldn't call home because we didn't have a telephone until after, until about 1950, so there wasn't any way to call home.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.050
And I'm not sure that I,

15:00.650 --> 15:03.535
that I told my parents what was going on.

15:03.555 --> 15:09.166
I don't think I told much now that when the hometown buddies went home, they told me.

15:09.186 --> 15:15.177
Of course, they had to justify why they dropped out, so they made things sound terrible.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.043
Did you begin to write letters regularly to your parents?

15:18.223 --> 15:19.185
Oh, yes, yes.

15:20.828 --> 15:22.050
About how often?

15:23.195 --> 15:25.759
Oh, at least once a week.

15:25.779 --> 15:27.962
And I probably still have them here somewhere.

15:28.282 --> 15:30.425
My mother kept them, I think.

15:30.445 --> 15:36.914
If someone were to read those letters now, would they get a very accurate account of fish life at A&M?

15:36.954 --> 15:37.575
Probably not.

15:38.837 --> 15:39.738
No.

15:39.758 --> 15:41.320
What, you left out some things?

15:41.500 --> 15:43.363
Although there's a very interesting,

15:44.525 --> 15:45.987
Well, I'll say two things.

15:46.307 --> 15:53.717
One, first time I went home was Thanksgiving, because there weren't any cars in those days, and we couldn't travel on the weekend.

15:53.757 --> 15:54.798
We had to stay on campus.

15:57.362 --> 16:07.194
Dad's mother had died the year before I was born, so I never knew her, but he had an aunt who was kind of a grandmother to me.

16:08.977 --> 16:10.018
I got home Thanksgiving.

16:10.058 --> 16:12.321
She took one look at me, and she said, Richard.

16:17.802 --> 16:26.974
I had lost about 30 pounds and I was pretty haggard at Thanksgiving.

16:27.434 --> 16:30.779
Now that loss of weight, that loss of weight came.

16:30.819 --> 16:33.362
Who are you talking about?

16:33.742 --> 16:34.283
Your picture.

16:34.904 --> 16:36.506
Oh.

16:36.726 --> 16:39.209
That loss of weight came from what?

16:41.112 --> 16:44.316
Oh, just the stress.

16:46.405 --> 16:57.242
You know, not being able to eat properly, and the stress at the table, the time in which you had to eat, and so forth, and the hazing.

16:58.664 --> 17:12.726
The other thing I was going to say was that probably in about 1979, I was at a funeral in College Station Cemetery, and D.W.

17:12.746 --> 17:13.948
Williams came over to me.

17:15.413 --> 17:17.235
And he said, I've never told you this.

17:17.955 --> 17:23.420
But he said, when you were a freshman, your father came to see me to talk about hazing.

17:25.402 --> 17:27.584
And Dad had never said a word to me about it.

17:29.806 --> 17:31.247
And D.W.

17:31.287 --> 17:33.088
Williams had been a professor of Dad's.

17:34.089 --> 17:35.911
And Dad had kept in touch with him over the years.

17:35.991 --> 17:42.076
So he felt free to come and talk to him about the hazing situation that I know.

17:42.096 --> 17:45.319
Now that's the kind of special item that I'm delighted to have in here.

17:45.839 --> 17:47.801
And your dad never mentioned it to you?

17:47.821 --> 17:49.503
Dad never said a word to me about it.

17:49.723 --> 17:50.744
I never knew that he came.

17:51.825 --> 17:56.990
And he never encouraged you to think about dropping out or anything like that?

17:57.371 --> 18:00.814
Oh no, no, no.

18:00.834 --> 18:13.247
And Dad had never really talked to me much about it, but I guess what he read in the paper and what these boys said went on.

18:13.818 --> 18:14.699
Anyway, that's.

18:14.719 --> 18:18.024
Your, who was your first fish old lady?

18:20.107 --> 18:20.187
W.A.

18:20.247 --> 18:20.608
Barber.

18:21.109 --> 18:21.449
From?

18:22.651 --> 18:22.991
Linden.

18:23.712 --> 18:24.534
Describe him.

18:24.554 --> 18:25.295
East Texas.

18:25.315 --> 18:26.356
In your relationship.

18:26.697 --> 18:28.540
Oh, he was, actually there were two.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.624
Who was the other one?

18:33.393 --> 18:35.538
Oh, Schuller, Bert Schuller.

18:36.580 --> 18:42.212
Bert Schuller's from Houston, and the two were exactly opposite.

18:44.517 --> 18:44.878
W.A.

18:44.938 --> 18:52.093
was a country boy from Linden, talked with a slow drawl.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.780
Very laid back.

18:54.861 --> 19:01.789
Bert Schuller was an engineering major from Houston and very gregarious, open.

19:02.550 --> 19:09.317
Both of them dropped out, by the way, before midterm of the fall semester.

19:10.478 --> 19:14.182
Describe, when you all got moved in, describe your room.

19:15.123 --> 19:16.945
What was, what was in it?

19:17.646 --> 19:18.587
Where did people sleep?

19:20.018 --> 19:26.768
Well, they had the bunk beds and there were two in the bunk, I mean two had bunk beds and then there was a single bed and there were three of us in the room.

19:29.172 --> 19:30.354
And that didn't leave much room.

19:31.215 --> 19:35.682
I've forgotten how many desks there were, but it was pretty crowded.

19:37.164 --> 19:38.987
And who decided who got what bed?

19:39.367 --> 19:40.068
How long was that done?

19:40.088 --> 19:43.073
I don't remember how we decided that.

19:44.369 --> 19:45.831
And it wasn't air conditioned.

19:46.192 --> 19:47.554
It wasn't air conditioned, you're right.

19:49.417 --> 19:54.024
All right, then the juniors and seniors come the second week.

19:54.044 --> 19:56.167
How did things change when they arrived?

19:59.432 --> 20:01.114
It just became more hectic, I guess.

20:01.214 --> 20:09.126
We had more people, more people yelling at us.

20:09.146 --> 20:12.351
Were there many veterans in the Corps then?

20:13.293 --> 20:17.801
Not very many, and there was a separate non-reg.

20:18.562 --> 20:22.069
I mean there was a separate veterans unit.

20:22.089 --> 20:26.457
There may have been two, but they had their own units.

20:27.518 --> 20:31.385
And there were some who were veterans, but not very many.

20:31.746 --> 20:35.393
And the enrollment was quite large, wasn't it, for that era?

20:35.413 --> 20:37.917
I don't know what it was that fall.

20:38.318 --> 20:44.606
I do know that my senior year got up to 10,000, which was a peak.

20:44.626 --> 20:50.493
And our graduating class, June of 50, was the largest on record to that time, 1,000.

20:51.294 --> 20:55.540
When you were a fish, what did you and your buddies think about these World War II veterans?

21:00.826 --> 21:01.247
I don't know.

21:01.287 --> 21:04.731
It was just two different worlds.

21:05.369 --> 21:20.506
Looking back in some of the classes, they were older and more mature, and I think that showed they tended to discuss things more than the younger students did.

21:22.228 --> 21:30.678
Did you and any of your buddies start any kind of mischief early to retaliate against the— Oh, sure.

21:30.698 --> 21:31.599
Give some examples.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.942
Drownouts were a good one.

21:35.660 --> 22:02.089
where we, as sophomores, one of the objectives was if somebody was, did something particularly bad to you, you wanted to get back on, and so you'd drown them out and take a garbage can and fill it with water and open the door and throw it in on them and then hope you didn't get caught.

22:02.255 --> 22:04.137
Did you ever participate in drowning?

22:04.157 --> 22:04.617
Oh, yes.

22:05.138 --> 22:06.459
Did you ever get caught?

22:06.479 --> 22:08.221
No, no.

22:08.241 --> 22:11.885
For some that did get caught, what kind of punishment did they get?

22:11.905 --> 22:15.489
Well, all of us got it when they couldn't catch the person that did it.

22:16.149 --> 22:17.110
We all got it.

22:17.130 --> 22:17.370
What?

22:17.751 --> 22:18.271
What did they?

22:18.472 --> 22:20.834
Oh, calisthenics, push-ups.

22:24.538 --> 22:29.663
Mainly push-ups, having to do sit-ups in the hall and squat in the hall.

22:31.702 --> 22:34.285
being yelled at and so forth.

22:34.505 --> 22:36.608
How soon was a paddle used?

22:38.189 --> 22:39.050
Oh, immediately.

22:39.831 --> 22:40.692
And what was it?

22:40.712 --> 22:41.433
I took swimming.

22:42.034 --> 22:43.115
What kind of paddle was it?

22:45.197 --> 22:46.939
Well, they were specially made.

22:47.460 --> 22:50.683
No, but was it made out of a baseball bat?

22:50.724 --> 22:51.825
No, no, no, no.

22:51.845 --> 22:56.450
They were made out of one by, probably one by six.

22:56.910 --> 23:00.915
They were, they weren't oars, but they were a lot like an oar.

23:02.228 --> 23:10.756
just a straight piece of wood with a handle put on it.

23:11.116 --> 23:20.124
And by the way, if you go over there in any of those cord arms today and you could get down between the walls, you'd find an awful lot of them in there.

23:22.146 --> 23:31.594
Because after the bulls cracked down so much and if anybody got word that they were coming, you would,

23:31.996 --> 23:37.618
jerk that medicine cabinet off the wall and drop your board down the

23:38.324 --> 23:39.125
Down in the wall.

23:39.385 --> 23:39.866
So.

23:39.886 --> 23:43.050
No telling how many you could find over there.

23:43.410 --> 23:46.874
It could not be retrieved.

23:46.894 --> 23:46.954
No.

23:46.974 --> 23:50.318
They were desperate to get rid of.

23:51.260 --> 24:00.170
Describe early in your freshman fall, describe a typical class day from beginning to end.

24:00.571 --> 24:03.194
What time did you get up and what did you all do when?

24:05.116 --> 24:08.280
Well, we had to get up early and I don't remember the hours, but.

24:09.053 --> 24:28.392
We had to get up early and get our rooms cleaned up before breakfast before we fell out and we'd fall out for formation and march to breakfast and then come back and we'd have to clean up our upperclassmen's rooms before we went to class and classes started at eight.

24:29.673 --> 24:38.942
We used to have the old whistle up at the power plant and it

24:39.597 --> 24:47.397
One thing that is vivid in my memory is how much it rained that fall.

24:47.579 --> 24:49.702
I thought this was the wettest place on the earth.

24:51.183 --> 24:55.929
And we had to, we had those old rubberized raincoats.

24:57.251 --> 25:01.295
And so we would get hot rushing between class, hot and sweaty.

25:02.297 --> 25:03.798
And then we'd chill in the class.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.882
And I kept it cold till Thanksgiving.

25:08.905 --> 25:10.847
But we had to run between classes.

25:11.368 --> 25:15.072
And what I was going to say earlier about the paddle,

25:16.300 --> 25:20.685
We, or I, finagled to take swimming.

25:22.327 --> 25:23.349
You had the alternative.

25:23.369 --> 25:26.653
You had to run the, what, the mile and seven tenths.

25:28.295 --> 25:29.416
And everybody had to do that.

25:29.536 --> 25:31.959
Or if you couldn't swim, you could take swimming.

25:31.979 --> 25:34.182
Well, I finagled to swim.

25:35.724 --> 25:41.751
And Art Adamson was the instructor.

25:42.136 --> 25:56.670
You could tell when the upperclassmen had been on a tear because you could see the butts of the freshmen.

25:56.690 --> 26:00.499
We swam into nude in those days, and old men.

26:00.985 --> 26:04.369
It's very obvious what was going on.

26:04.429 --> 26:07.252
If they really wanted to crack down, they'd gone to swimming.

26:07.292 --> 26:10.415
The swimming pool that you all used was where?

26:10.836 --> 26:11.797
Downs and Auditorium.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.119
And it was covered?

26:14.940 --> 26:15.321
Indoor.

26:16.202 --> 26:16.943
Did it have heat?

26:19.846 --> 26:20.567
I guess it did.

26:20.627 --> 26:25.372
I'm sure it did because we swam year round.

26:25.392 --> 26:26.173
Must have.

26:26.193 --> 26:29.136
How big a class would there be?

26:30.398 --> 26:31.199
Oh, golly.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.421
I'd say probably 30.

26:35.163 --> 26:36.064
Good-sized class.

26:37.545 --> 26:41.529
And you're glad that you were able to do swimming instead of the regular PE.

26:42.030 --> 26:45.473
Do you remember much about your first semester of classes?

26:45.553 --> 26:50.959
What were some of the classes, or all of them if you can remember them?

26:50.979 --> 26:51.439
Oh, golly.

26:52.961 --> 26:57.165
Let me say that I had five professors that my dad had.

26:57.567 --> 27:02.317
Mr. Bryson for chemistry, I had him for freshman chemistry.

27:04.983 --> 27:05.243
A.L.

27:05.263 --> 27:10.935
Darnell for dairy science.

27:13.919 --> 27:17.663
Humphrey, no, golly, Hubert.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.086
Humbert, Humbert, Humbert.

27:21.106 --> 27:25.751
Mr. Humbert was a geneticist.

27:25.771 --> 27:29.614
And he was one of these people who was very, very strict.

27:29.955 --> 27:33.078
But anyway, Dad had him and I had him.

27:34.159 --> 27:38.563
I believe Dr. Mayo.

27:39.364 --> 27:39.824
In English?

27:39.944 --> 27:40.465
In English.

27:40.725 --> 27:43.588
Oh, describe him if you can, as a teacher.

27:44.125 --> 27:46.089
Oh, excellent teacher.

27:46.169 --> 27:50.679
I had a sophomore English from O.F.

27:50.820 --> 27:51.080
Allen.

27:52.584 --> 27:55.811
No, no, freshman English, second semester.

27:57.514 --> 28:01.864
And he took a liking to me and recommended that I

28:03.667 --> 28:14.062
that I skipped the regular sequence and went into literature under Dr. Morgan, S.H.

28:14.082 --> 28:14.443
Morgan.

28:16.586 --> 28:19.069
I'm trying to think who else it was that Dad had.

28:20.331 --> 28:21.653
Anyway, there were five props.

28:21.854 --> 28:25.098
Well, I had chemistry right after lunch, if you can believe it.

28:25.399 --> 28:26.040
Who was that?

28:26.801 --> 28:27.482
Mr. Bryson.

28:28.063 --> 28:28.984
I mean, Brayton.

28:29.104 --> 28:29.344
Brayton.

28:29.364 --> 28:32.509
Brayton Fire School is the name for him.

28:33.957 --> 28:37.057
And this shows you the kind of mischief that we were up to.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.339
Had in the old chemistry lecture room.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.912
And right after lunch, so you can imagine how hot it was.

28:45.694 --> 28:49.200
And here we were, these freshmen that hadn't gotten much sleep the night before.

28:50.402 --> 28:54.289
And so nearly everybody was dozing.

28:55.912 --> 29:05.348
And we would take matches and give someone who was dozing a hot foot.

29:05.328 --> 29:12.708
I'll tell you the things we did, climbing the water tower and the tunnels, all of that kind of stuff.

29:12.728 --> 29:15.135
How long before you learned about the tunnels?

29:15.908 --> 29:16.989
Oh, immediately.

29:17.971 --> 29:21.195
I learned just immediately, yes.

29:21.776 --> 29:23.318
Probably the first week.

29:23.338 --> 29:33.851
Anyway, had English, well had swimming probably at 10 o'clock, and then had to get to English in the academic building at 11, so that was always a problem.

29:34.693 --> 29:38.878
Forgotten what I had first period, but I remember chemistry.

29:38.858 --> 29:42.643
English before lunch and chemistry right after lunch.

29:42.924 --> 29:43.164
All right.

29:43.244 --> 29:50.595
Then in the afternoon, when did drills and so forth, when did activities after class begin?

29:50.635 --> 29:51.957
After 5.

29:52.217 --> 29:53.860
In other words, classes went until 5.

29:54.821 --> 30:01.170
But what if you didn't have anything you had to do in the afternoons if you didn't have a class?

30:02.669 --> 30:03.891
No, but we had classes.

30:04.031 --> 30:07.456
I mean, we took 18 hours, you see.

30:08.658 --> 30:11.642
And I had chemistry lab, had biology lab.

30:11.662 --> 30:13.084
Okay.

30:15.849 --> 30:18.412
Military science, I think we had a lab with that.

30:18.793 --> 30:19.554
We did marching.

30:21.437 --> 30:24.842
So I don't remember any free time in the afternoons.

30:24.862 --> 30:25.443
Okay.

30:25.623 --> 30:29.048
Then back in evening meal was at 6?

30:30.648 --> 30:32.049
Somewhere in there, yes.

30:32.290 --> 30:34.892
Fall in and march to chow.

30:35.813 --> 30:39.016
Then after supper, describe the routine on a weeknight.

30:39.537 --> 30:43.140
Well, we had to be in our hole and had to be studying.

30:44.602 --> 30:52.450
And that was strictly off-limits for the upperclassmen until 10, I think it was 10 o'clock.

30:52.470 --> 30:57.735
We were to study and apply ourselves.

30:58.222 --> 31:00.806
And how often did you all study till 10?

31:02.389 --> 31:04.011
Oh, that was, that was enforced.

31:04.392 --> 31:07.557
I mean, that was, that was strict.

31:08.699 --> 31:14.788
The, that first semester you had mentioned some high school courses you had not had.

31:15.690 --> 31:17.813
Did that affect your first year or so?

31:20.117 --> 31:23.402
Well, of course chemistry was particularly hard.
