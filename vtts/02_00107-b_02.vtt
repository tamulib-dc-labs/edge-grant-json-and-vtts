WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:06.933
From the dean, he said, Hennigan, what's that bed doing up in your lab?

00:07.714 --> 00:09.976
I said, a bed in my lab?

00:09.996 --> 00:12.379
He said, yeah, the guard just wants to know what's going on.

00:12.399 --> 00:13.360
I said, well, I don't know yet.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.323
I'll come up and find out what's happening.

00:16.343 --> 00:17.685
And it was real funny.

00:17.745 --> 00:27.536
Find out what had happened is this guy who's a funny guy had gotten drunk, and these two girls got all his bedroom and the table and the lamp and got a pickup truck.

00:27.616 --> 00:29.518
And I don't know how the heck they got it in the lab.

00:30.299 --> 00:32.181
But when I came, dean called me and said,

00:32.600 --> 00:33.681
What's going on up there?

00:33.701 --> 00:34.562
I said, man, I don't know.

00:35.143 --> 00:36.565
So we finally got it.

00:36.585 --> 00:37.286
But that was cute.

00:37.306 --> 00:41.671
So the girls are just, you know, just superb.

00:43.773 --> 00:58.371
Share with this machine and future people who will listen to this material and will read it, share some events that you remember where you're proud to have helped a student.

00:58.992 --> 01:02.519
reach a goal that that student was trying to achieve?

01:03.621 --> 01:06.708
Where did you advise or counsel or help?

01:07.148 --> 01:09.112
You know high school it's really hard to say.

01:10.114 --> 01:13.642
I did that for every student I tracked for 25 years.

01:14.483 --> 01:15.626
I've been in on divorces.

01:16.087 --> 01:20.275
I've been in on just encouraging them.

01:22.111 --> 01:28.099
Well, one guy, he was here for one semester as an ME and he made a .1.

01:29.260 --> 01:32.645
So he spent five years in the service and came back and they wouldn't take him back.

01:33.726 --> 01:42.237
Now, it just so happens he spent five years, had five stripes, and was qualified medic and physician assistant and nobody asked him.

01:42.257 --> 01:46.903
So he came over to me and I said, you bet, we'll give you a try.

01:47.339 --> 01:51.525
I didn't have to, I was back in the old days when they let me make some decisions here.

01:51.965 --> 01:55.951
And this guy made B's and A's and something, Tom, I don't remember his name.

01:56.732 --> 01:57.633
But this was recently.

01:58.634 --> 02:09.229
Had that and had some guys that had been, I used to go in the hall and visit with them and see what's going on, why they weren't an IE and told them they better be.

02:09.209 --> 02:29.156
I helped, I would say, a lot of the little girls didn't, young ladies, I call them little girls to be sure, I call them little girls, be sure I keep them in the little girl kind of category, even though they were beautiful little girls, you know, but gotta keep them in little girls.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.500
Well, I forgot what I was saying.

02:33.037 --> 02:35.280
Well, where you did some help.

02:35.300 --> 02:35.641
Oh, yeah.

02:35.981 --> 02:36.642
Yeah, well we helped.

02:36.703 --> 02:46.237
They would be real frightened they wouldn't get a job and I told her you're going to get seven offers and they got seven offers but about the first of their senior year they're just absolutely frightened.

02:46.938 --> 02:58.656
But I worked, I can tell you just about, I mean we got all kind of things and this is what I, the reason I wanted to do that is if they felt comfortable and I could solve their problems then they'd make better grades I thought.

02:58.636 --> 03:05.763
So I've had divorce cases, girlfriend, a lot of girlfriend, boyfriend problems.

03:06.243 --> 03:13.390
One, it got expected and came in and talked to me and kept the baby and we loaned her our crib, things like that.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.532
There's a mentor.

03:15.712 --> 03:17.694
I had a Russian guy that came in.

03:18.535 --> 03:23.340
He saw my sign, mentor, and he came in and he was crying.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.341
I said, what's the problem?

03:24.401 --> 03:25.842
He said, well, it talks about it.

03:26.446 --> 03:27.510
He can't do the homework.

03:28.072 --> 03:29.397
He just couldn't do the homework.

03:30.421 --> 03:34.436
So I said, well, now, everybody else does the homework, but I can't do that.

03:34.456 --> 03:35.038
Well, why not?

03:35.761 --> 03:48.914
So I called the prof and found out that this guy was the sharpest person out of Russia, where Kiev is, that's Eukerane.

03:48.934 --> 04:01.667
He was the sharpest engineer out of the Eukerane, made the highest grade on anything, and every time they'd give him a homework problem, he'd go back to Newton and Maxwell and develop it all the way through, and he'd get 12 books, and he couldn't work the homework problem.

04:01.647 --> 04:14.238
But anyway when we had it, so I think I helped him stay and then we had his master's examination and the EE prof said we can't teach you anymore here.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.240
You know more than any of us.

04:16.260 --> 04:21.004
So they had 14 graduate students at MIT and he was number 15.

04:21.225 --> 04:23.627
They only had room for 14 but they took him.

04:24.708 --> 04:30.473
And so I feel he doesn't remember me and that's part of the game there but that feels good you know.

04:30.773 --> 04:38.388
Now you, during these years, were you the, did you have a specific title?

04:38.648 --> 04:39.309
Were you the?

04:39.830 --> 04:42.976
I was kind of the academic advisor, yeah.

04:42.997 --> 04:44.820
Was that an official part of your task?

04:45.541 --> 04:50.471
Yeah, it was official in addition to about 12 hours in the classroom, yeah.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.793
I got no credit for it.

04:51.994 --> 04:53.136
And you did that for how many years?

04:53.302 --> 04:54.605
About 17 really.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.389
Yeah, about 17 out of 29.

04:56.890 --> 05:00.357
Really it's more, it's almost a full time, but yeah.

05:00.397 --> 05:08.695
Do you remember any last minute emergencies where somebody needs fat pulled out of the fire just before commencement?

05:08.715 --> 05:10.740
Absolutely, and I know how to do that.

05:11.181 --> 05:12.323
Describe something.

05:13.957 --> 05:21.228
Well, we had one guy that was in the Corps, dating, working 50 hours a week, and had a very low grade.

05:21.248 --> 05:34.126
And so when he came up, we found out, of course, we learned it later, I mean, we learned it, anyway, utilized, that if he has any low grades, Fs, in courses that are not in his major, you can waive them for graduation purposes only.

05:35.128 --> 05:38.833
So really, this guy had about a 198, but we waived those, and he had a 20.

05:39.050 --> 05:39.833
in graduating.

05:40.194 --> 05:41.319
We did that on a couple guys.

05:41.419 --> 05:50.494
One guy and this guy went on to McDonnell Douglas and was voted the most promising young engineer and oh

05:51.841 --> 06:01.278
And at Muster, I told you, didn't tell you, that the guy came up to me, his name was Mike.

06:01.298 --> 06:04.964
But anyway, Mike said, you don't remember me probably, but I was in IA years.

06:05.085 --> 06:07.088
I made medium grades.

06:07.128 --> 06:08.170
I wasn't a very good student.

06:08.611 --> 06:16.465
But he said, just want you to know that I'm working on my third million right now, that just because a guy didn't make good grades doesn't mean he can't win.

06:16.445 --> 06:21.871
So he was real proud of that, Mike was, and he's in Los Alamos.

06:23.172 --> 06:25.815
I guess there's one guy that just busted.

06:26.696 --> 06:27.637
He was just so defeated.

06:27.697 --> 06:28.557
His wife left him.

06:28.578 --> 06:34.203
He was down here, and I talked to him, and boy, he had called me every week when he went to work.

06:35.865 --> 06:43.633
So I think that's something that we don't have now because the secretaries, we promoted a secretary to do that.

06:44.120 --> 06:55.336
Not that she isn't great, but she doesn't know the courses, doesn't know the jobs, doesn't know what you got to go through and doing all the advising because no one wants to and the reason they don't is you don't get paid for it.

06:55.437 --> 06:57.680
You can't get any credit for advising.

06:57.700 --> 07:03.468
I did a study and looked at all the pay and all of the engineering advisors were the lowest paid in their department.

07:04.710 --> 07:09.317
And yet, if you look at the students, we had 520 students when I

07:09.905 --> 07:11.407
I quit.

07:11.467 --> 07:14.973
We're down now to about 300 because you got to hustle kids.

07:15.654 --> 07:16.575
You got to treat them right.

07:16.595 --> 07:20.902
You got to find a little extra something for them to do.

07:22.124 --> 07:30.917
Now, your last years, in number of majors, industrial engineering was among the largest majors, wasn't it?

07:31.403 --> 07:32.224
In the recent years?

07:32.884 --> 07:39.831
No, we're running about I guess double E and ME and civil and nuclear.

07:40.492 --> 07:42.254
So no, we aren't the biggest.

07:42.514 --> 07:47.359
We had a big graduate school for a while because Werther was interested in that.

07:48.840 --> 08:00.972
How did you and your colleagues try, how did you work to ensure that you all were staying in step with the changes in industry?

08:01.289 --> 08:03.694
Well, you're trying to say, did we have an industrial council?

08:03.754 --> 08:04.877
We finally got one of those.

08:05.538 --> 08:11.852
But I think from meetings and so forth, just, and I don't know if we stayed in step.

08:11.932 --> 08:14.819
That's why I'm kind of happy to be gone because I got a call.

08:14.839 --> 08:16.783
They want 40 engineers in time study.

08:17.270 --> 08:20.976
And a guy called me Matt, one of my graduate students, and he's doing something like that.

08:21.517 --> 08:24.621
Bill is the guy, I had three of them come by yesterday, I can't believe it.

08:25.122 --> 08:28.888
Bill is working for a healthcare computer system.

08:29.909 --> 08:44.712
So the question is, I think we've gone too far away to science and math and physics and math and statistics, which I think will, I think, but again,

08:46.953 --> 08:48.855
That's just my opinion, you know.

08:48.875 --> 08:52.098
All right, let me be sure that I understand what I believe you're saying.

08:52.838 --> 08:57.723
Are you saying that you fear it's becoming too theoretical?

08:57.923 --> 08:58.443
Yes.

08:58.463 --> 08:59.904
And not enough practical.

08:59.944 --> 09:00.845
Absolutely.

09:01.206 --> 09:07.992
And you remember I said I had a choice of rice and A&M and I studied them both and felt that that was important then.

09:08.712 --> 09:15.238
And I still feel it's important now because of my little comment about Bill Black, who is now a cutting torch engineer.

09:15.218 --> 09:20.164
meaning there's a heck of a lot more than what we're giving them.

09:20.184 --> 09:37.023
I think our leadership got their PhD in what's called operations research or math and they're kind of now phasing up into the leadership phase and what's going to have to happen is they're going to be phasing down and Purdue's already started that and then the hands-on is coming back.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.930
The last few years that you were a full-time faculty member,

09:43.433 --> 09:51.304
describe what your normal routine was in courses you taught and so forth.

09:51.324 --> 09:56.152
Well, the day started, I got there usually 7.30, had my own parking.

09:56.833 --> 10:01.499
I'd leave there usually after 4.30, but sometimes around 6.30.

10:03.002 --> 10:08.850
We used to stay there all day, that was kind of our back in Worthing, early, early years.

10:10.248 --> 10:12.775
So that's, question again, what did you just say?

10:12.835 --> 10:14.059
Well, you were teaching about him.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.847
Okay, yeah, I was teaching about 14 hours.

10:17.589 --> 10:25.371
I had five labs and I had, but see, I was a teacher, so I was 100% teaching and they really gave me 100%.

10:25.351 --> 10:33.705
And most, a lot of the guys tried to kind of do more research or let their TAs teach it, but I wanted to be there.

10:33.725 --> 10:34.506
Which courses were you teaching?

10:34.526 --> 10:40.937
I was teaching the time study of work measurement has to do with efficiency improvement.

10:40.957 --> 10:43.461
Those were primarily to what level students?

10:43.660 --> 10:45.063
They were two sophomores.

10:45.083 --> 10:45.825
Sophomores.

10:45.845 --> 10:53.845
And then I had the senior level design course where we did the factory design and I took them out many times to a factory.

10:54.386 --> 10:59.037
Usually had four projects working somewhere within 100 miles or so.

10:59.017 --> 11:06.267
But that was a senior design and then I had the senior design course in ergonomics, which we really helped develop here.

11:06.327 --> 11:11.996
I built the first human factors lab in 66 and finished it in 67.

11:12.016 --> 11:13.598
Then we moved over to Zachary in 70.

11:14.179 --> 11:16.762
I built a big human factors lab in the basement.

11:16.863 --> 11:20.368
Old Dean Benson gave me $90,000 to build that.

11:21.369 --> 11:24.113
So I would,

11:25.392 --> 11:26.714
I'm lost here.

11:26.734 --> 11:38.870
Which corporations did you find it most easy to work with in trying to play students, to get intern experience?

11:38.890 --> 11:40.332
UPS appreciated ours.

11:40.372 --> 11:43.216
We got about 14 with them.

11:43.636 --> 11:44.177
Okay.

11:45.001 --> 11:45.862
appreciated those.

11:45.882 --> 11:47.184
We must have 30 with them.

11:48.105 --> 11:52.871
General Electric's phased down, Westinghouse, we have a lot with TI.

11:52.891 --> 11:59.680
We got about 400 with TI and then we have a hundred or so with LTV.

12:00.681 --> 12:06.989
So they were here looking for people and the little group, well the people got many offers.

12:07.931 --> 12:12.797
All the time I've been here except for one year they'd get five or six offers and so

12:14.735 --> 12:16.197
because they were real good management.

12:16.217 --> 12:25.952
We had a lot, I started healthcare called hospital management engineering and we have about 15 in that now working in that.

12:25.972 --> 12:31.160
Right now, I've run all, I've only got a few more questions left but you've made a lot of notes.

12:31.180 --> 12:32.082
What have we not covered?

12:32.102 --> 12:38.852
Well, I was just thinking of one, we talked about hitchhiking, I was going to mention that.

12:39.558 --> 12:43.907
The one that I remember too, another funny story, a guy wrote a letter to the bat.

12:43.927 --> 12:49.538
He'd write every day how great Oklahoma was and how terrible A&M was, that A&M needs to change.

12:50.239 --> 12:55.930
And one day I came home from class and I heard Boomer Sumer being played by about 20 guys in the band.

12:56.611 --> 12:59.457
And we looked out there and they had packed his car

12:59.605 --> 13:02.892
put it out on the street, and they played Boomer Sooners.

13:02.932 --> 13:08.044
They walked over there, kind of carried him to his car, and then they played the War Hymn coming back.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.487
I just thought that was hilarious.

13:09.948 --> 13:11.892
That must have been in about 53.

13:12.694 --> 13:14.758
He was a corps member?

13:14.879 --> 13:17.885
No, he was just a, he might have been a corps member.

13:17.966 --> 13:18.627
I don't remember.

13:18.607 --> 13:19.690
But he was an undergraduate.

13:19.710 --> 13:21.415
Yeah, an undergraduate, yeah.

13:21.435 --> 13:21.615
Oh, okay.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.618
I thought that was funny.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.345
And I told you about the bonfire guy.

13:26.448 --> 13:29.838
See, he built the lab.

13:29.958 --> 13:33.628
Oh, there's another one that was.

13:33.608 --> 13:36.090
I used to chew cigars.

13:36.210 --> 13:42.076
I'd light them once and then just chew them the rest of the day and I learned that in the Air Force and so I'd do that.

13:42.096 --> 13:48.062
So I'd come into class with my books and I'd have my cigar and I'd set it on there and lay my books down and reach over and I told you that.

13:48.082 --> 13:56.630
I turned around after I got the board clean, turned around and everybody had a cigar, the girls and the guys and I still think that was real cute.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.211
What was your reaction to that?

13:58.231 --> 13:58.892
I just laughed.

13:58.992 --> 14:01.354
I just thought that was hilarious.

14:01.334 --> 14:09.196
Because kids, when you get to be part of it, it really— Now that's an acceptance signal.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.479
Yes, that's an acceptance signal.

14:11.341 --> 14:11.983
Let's see.

14:13.267 --> 14:13.768
Handle.

14:14.450 --> 14:14.871
Oh.

14:15.357 --> 14:17.619
I've talked to several guys on this.

14:17.679 --> 14:23.765
Coming back to A&M on Sunday, it was terrifying to see that tower and know you're going to be back.

14:24.305 --> 14:28.529
Boy, I talked to another guy, several guys said that was really terrifying.

14:32.133 --> 14:35.616
But you know, looking at this, I've done what I've wanted to and that's the difference.

14:35.796 --> 14:37.918
I wanted to be a prof and I wanted to work with the kids.

14:39.039 --> 14:42.242
I've had them over here many times.

14:42.222 --> 14:45.946
I had many, many problems to solve and gave my ideas.

14:47.207 --> 14:48.708
And I feel real good.

14:48.729 --> 14:50.510
I didn't make promotion.

14:50.550 --> 14:54.354
I'd never make professor because you have to be a researcher to be a professor.

14:55.215 --> 14:59.920
And of course, I researched with General Electric, jet engines, and that's real stuff.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.942
And I don't know.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.223
I just never did it.

15:03.844 --> 15:12.212
So I became an associate prof, but I got to work with the kids for 30 years here in junior high.

15:12.378 --> 15:19.526
And I guess I won two out of the three former student awards for teaching and, you know, student relations.

15:19.546 --> 15:23.171
So I really feel like it's been a good season, a good year.

15:24.072 --> 15:35.245
And we've never, like to say my problem or call it a problem or not, once I decided I was working with GE and decided to go into teaching, I really enjoyed that.

15:35.866 --> 15:37.147
And I think I've contributed.

15:37.868 --> 15:41.372
And like I say, we get calls quite often and it's funny.

15:42.837 --> 15:45.742
Okay, that's over.

15:45.782 --> 15:47.305
These kind of wind-up questions.

15:47.325 --> 15:48.948
Okay, wind-up questions.

15:48.968 --> 15:57.383
What did it mean, looking back, what did it mean to you that you were an undergraduate at Texas A&M?

15:57.403 --> 15:58.585
What has it meant to your life?

15:58.784 --> 16:01.788
Boy, that's meant everything, more or less.

16:01.848 --> 16:08.796
You hate to say that because it doesn't really because you change every day or every month, but you look back, gave you an opportunity.

16:09.197 --> 16:11.440
I was in the same floor with H.B.

16:11.460 --> 16:11.840
Zachary.

16:13.262 --> 16:14.043
He's a great guy.

16:14.063 --> 16:20.150
I don't mean that in any way, but can you imagine a guy working family that didn't have any money at all?

16:21.071 --> 16:23.234
I think I'd gave you an opportunity, gave you a chance.

16:23.314 --> 16:24.015
A&M did.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.320
And then coming through life, it gave you confidence that you could.

16:28.060 --> 16:31.163
I was always, in high school, kind of lack of confidence.

16:31.904 --> 16:35.487
No money, wasn't a big football player, you know.

16:36.388 --> 16:40.112
And I'd say some of the things that happened here gave me the confidence for life.

16:40.752 --> 16:46.257
And then also when I flew jets, a small guy was just as good as a big guy.

16:46.317 --> 16:51.302
And I remember that, and kids were that way, they remember.

16:51.788 --> 17:07.774
If somebody gave you today a check for a million dollars with only one stipulation, you had to give it to Texas A&M, but you could specify what was to be done with it, what would you tell A&M to do with your million dollar gift?

17:10.438 --> 17:13.122
Don't spend a penny of it for administration of any kind.

17:14.266 --> 17:23.089
Don't put it through the foundation because the leader of that is making $300,000 a year and that's just a little bit excessive.

17:23.109 --> 17:28.022
But I'd say give it to something that, and I don't know about the best kids.

17:28.643 --> 17:35.029
We had one guy gave us three scholarships for the worst kids, the guy that was having the most trouble and that was interesting.

17:36.150 --> 17:46.160
I would guess I'd try to get it not in student activities, but I'd try to get it, since I was in that, related somehow to a ship.

17:46.721 --> 17:58.532
I'm not sure if it's a scholarship I would like or maybe development of something for the undergraduates would be better, maybe development of something, maybe a lab or,

17:58.512 --> 18:06.880
But somehow I would like to realize, to make people realize that the kids come here and they think you must make an A or you'll never get a job.

18:07.901 --> 18:12.586
And somehow they got to realize that there's good old guys and average guys that are, you know, okay.

18:12.606 --> 18:20.594
So I think I would, I'm a little bit ticked at the amount of money that comes in and goes for other things.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.917
But A&M needs other things, but I won't knock it.

18:24.718 --> 18:25.819
Okay, next step.

18:26.002 --> 18:27.364
Last question.

18:27.384 --> 18:30.508
What feelings do you hold in your heart today for Texas A&M?

18:32.310 --> 18:34.934
Well, I kind of feel I've dedicated my life to it in a way.

18:35.775 --> 18:42.964
And Jeanette has fitted, I was fortunate that she fitted in, fit in real good with the whole system here.

18:44.306 --> 18:50.635
We, I sometimes think that we paid our money and we got our deal.

18:51.536 --> 18:54.760
Sometimes think that A&M is just bricks, you know.

18:55.010 --> 18:55.791
That's what we remember.

18:55.811 --> 18:56.892
Everybody else changes.

18:56.953 --> 18:57.934
The bricks stay there.

18:58.575 --> 18:59.656
How are your brick collection?

18:59.676 --> 19:00.697
Didn't you have a brick collection?

19:01.238 --> 19:03.541
Yeah.

19:03.561 --> 19:08.087
But that's kind of what A&M is kind of an interesting cross feeling.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.489
A&M has been great to me.

19:09.509 --> 19:13.234
Not really, but the system has been great.

19:13.835 --> 19:16.478
I paid my dues, you know, all that.

19:18.803 --> 19:23.421
So I sometimes have a little feeling there, but yeah, I don't know what I'd do without having been here.

19:23.461 --> 19:27.196
And I have no idea where I'd be or anything.

19:28.341 --> 19:29.927
And I've had some great times.

19:30.734 --> 19:40.445
Life has been good enough for me, engineer salary and so forth, and profs, teaching profs salary, I've just really enjoyed a lot.

19:40.885 --> 19:44.009
And now that I'm retired, I got more money than I had when I was working.

19:44.629 --> 19:50.496
Of course, I don't do much of anything, but just continue your life and so on.

19:50.516 --> 20:00.387
So I think the university and the system and the concept is what did it, and A&M being conservative and, and, you know,

20:01.902 --> 20:04.107
I'm thinking political, not political.

20:05.310 --> 20:07.295
Where you like your country, you know, you develop that.

20:07.997 --> 20:12.327
And I've been proud of that all these many years, you bet.

20:12.889 --> 20:14.052
So that's about it.

20:14.473 --> 20:15.034
Thank you.

20:15.054 --> 20:16.738
Let's see, I covered everything, yeah.
