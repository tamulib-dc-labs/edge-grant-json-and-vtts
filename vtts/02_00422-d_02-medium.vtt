WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:29.127
And

00:00.031 --> 00:29.127
the modern Iran, at least the one that I'm 
acquainted with, dated back really to the former

00:00.031 --> 00:29.127
Shah's father, Reza Shah, who even though they say 
the Peacock Throne has existed for 2,000 years,

00:00.031 --> 00:29.127
something like that, his father was an illiterate 
sergeant and a cavalry. They called it the

00:30.473 --> 00:31.795
Cossack. It was based on the Russian Cossack. And 
actually, I think he was up and from in the

00:34.759 --> 00:38.824
Azerbaijan area there. And so he led the 
revolution that overthrew a very unpopular Shah.

00:48.137 --> 00:51.962
He had no intention, supposedly, of becoming a 
Shah. He was going to become a common leader. Sort

00:56.123 --> 01:00.750
of like Jimmy Carter walking, you know, to the 
inauguration and that sort of thing. But by public

01:01.591 --> 01:05.216
demand, they wanted him to become the shot. So here 
you got a guy who's the illiterate sergeant,

01:05.537 --> 01:12.908
former sergeant, who becomes the leader of the 
nation. He did have the ability with his

01:13.829 --> 01:25.506
down-to-earth leadership to appeal or to form a 
coalition, really, with all of the tribal

01:13.829 --> 01:25.506
leaders. And in the tribe, if you've been in Iran, 
they have their own really governmental

01:25.705 --> 01:30.031
structure. And he was able to pull all of them 
together to support the central government,

01:30.251 --> 01:38.103
which they hate. They hate now. They hate it in 
Korea. They hate it in Vietnam. Anywhere you go,

01:42.329 --> 01:45.633
out in the boondocks, they don't care about 
communism. They won't be left alone,

01:45.793 --> 01:50.460
particularly in Iran. So his only problem was that 
He was a great admirer of Germany, and he had German

01:53.060 --> 01:59.108
advisors. He was a great admirer of Hitler. And so 
coming to World War II, the British had him move to

02:01.591 --> 02:07.458
South Africa, where he died. But Shaw still was 
young. But he was popular. And Shaw then inherited

02:14.067 --> 02:18.893
the throne later on. Of course, he was a 
tempest-made on his life. It wounded him, but he

02:21.817 --> 02:22.898
wasn't. It wasn't seriously wounded. So he became 
a shot. He was popular. He was popular when we were

02:28.525 --> 02:29.947
there. He was a good man. He was highly trained. He 
was an expert on military subjects worldwide, all

02:35.572 --> 02:43.259
about the British, our Army, Navy, Air Force, 
German, French. He was a scholar of military

02:43.560 --> 02:48.785
operations.

02:48.805 --> 02:50.346
He was schooled, of course, in Switzerland. Also, 
he graduated with their own military academy. And

02:55.042 --> 02:56.023
he was a good man. He intended to modernize Iran, 
land reform, which he implemented, which made the

02:56.124 --> 03:06.298
rich people unhappy, and the Mullahs very 
unhappy. But he accomplished it. So they had this

03:09.663 --> 03:18.596
sort of a mutual, might have been kind of shaky, but 
a mutual coalition. Of course, a coalition,

03:18.896 --> 03:20.499
that's redundant. It would be mutual. of all of the 
tribes around Iran. And as we talked about, he had

03:24.566 --> 03:35.022
positioned a division or a brigade in the large 
population center, mainly recruited from the

03:24.566 --> 03:35.022
tribes. And for a while, they had no problem, 
because all you have to do is tell the tribal leader

03:36.044 --> 03:43.835
that your quota is 200 young men, for example. And 
they would produce them. It's only when it starts

03:46.479 --> 03:51.627
getting, you lose the support of these tribes, 
then you have a time. of getting your number of

03:52.045 --> 03:55.149
people. So the Shah was very responsive, and he 
knew what our mission was. We were paid, by the way,

03:59.774 --> 04:04.500
the mission by the Iranian government in addition 
to our own paycheck. I paid a great big old check

04:04.560 --> 04:07.624
amount like this. The military assistance group 
didn't get that. So the Iranians then felt that we

04:10.447 --> 04:16.294
worked for them in a way. So we were more than just 
visitors in the country. We were actually...

04:21.374 --> 04:30.183
which we couldn't be legally, but this was legal, 
it was approved, and the employment to a certain

04:21.374 --> 04:30.183
degree of the right. And I enjoyed it very much. We 
had several meetings with the Shah. Could you

04:34.186 --> 04:36.108
describe him? He was a very quiet individual, a 
very thoughtful individual. As you noticed in

04:43.075 --> 04:51.263
interviews before he died, he usually would 
think, it wasn't that he didn't have a command of

04:43.075 --> 04:51.263
the English language, because of course he spoke 
British English and not American English. But

04:56.235 --> 05:05.266
what impressed me, as I already said, was his 
knowledge, military knowledge, of all weapons. I

05:05.807 --> 05:17.581
don't mean he just had a speaking acquaintance 
with them, but he knew the character wisdom of the

05:05.807 --> 05:17.581
weapon, you know, the weight and all that sort of 
thing. And so it It wasn't just briefing him. You'd

05:20.885 --> 05:29.575
sit down, and he would actually discuss, because 
each time we would go, and I would go with the

05:20.885 --> 05:29.575
general, because I was a G3, talking about what's 
proposed for the next year. Even then, he'd ask for

05:30.436 --> 05:38.905
more, and then they could actually assimilate.

05:38.925 --> 05:47.575
But that was the nature of that assignment, trying 
to get along politically with the Iranians,

05:38.925 --> 05:47.575
trying to train them. Was

05:49.023 --> 05:53.950
communism a big fear? Well,

05:55.071 --> 06:09.672
as you know, too, you could draw a circle around 
Tehran, about, say, 50, 100 kilometers around

05:55.071 --> 06:09.672
Tehran. And that's really the seat. That's where 
the power is. Communism out in the provinces, The

06:19.077 --> 06:21.641
Tudor party, for example, didn't exist. It 
existed, though, in Tehran, because that's where

06:22.001 --> 06:26.388
it's important. And it wasn't popular with 
Iranians until Mosaddegh, for example, who

06:26.408 --> 06:34.320
definitely was not a communist at all.

06:36.724 --> 06:38.827
He was forced towards the Tudor party. But 
Mosaddegh,

06:38.847 --> 06:48.021
first they blamed the British, and they kicked out 
the British. After they nationalized the oil. In

06:50.982 --> 06:54.025
1951, they nationalized the British oil. And they 
didn't think the Iranians could operate the

06:55.006 --> 07:02.014
refinery down at Abaddon and also the others. But 
they did because the British, as they've done

07:03.336 --> 07:14.248
everywhere you know, as opposed to many other 
colonial powers, the British always trained the

07:03.336 --> 07:14.248
next echelon down. If this guy was the head of 
department or the assistant was a local native, So

07:18.983 --> 07:21.166
the British could move out and operate. Now, they 
couldn't. They couldn't over a long period of time

07:23.729 --> 07:27.013
as far as maintenance is concerned. And that's 
where the Americans came in. But they kicked out

07:28.355 --> 07:29.656
the British. Mosaddegh had blamed all of the 
problems of the country on the British. And you

07:36.004 --> 07:47.218
read newspaper articles now, and you are left 
impression in those particular times that the

07:36.004 --> 07:47.218
modulus was elected by popular vote, see? And the 
Shah dissolved the Majlis and kicked out

07:48.818 --> 07:58.634
Mosaddegh because he was a tyrant, and he was 
unpopular. They wanted to get rid of him. And he,

08:00.417 --> 08:07.950
beginning right then, that's the reason we all 
hate the Shah, because that is when the Americans

08:00.417 --> 08:07.950
should not have supported the Shah. They should 
have let him remain in Italy, and then we would have

08:08.210 --> 08:15.282
had democracy in Iran way back in 1951. or 52 when 
actually most of that got kicked out. That's not

08:21.146 --> 08:21.947
true. He was very popular. How do I know he's 
popular? Not only by going around visiting, which

08:25.551 --> 08:34.383
I went all over Iran, but we used the Shah's train to 
go up to Bandershah up on the Caspian. We wanted to

08:35.164 --> 08:40.371
go there because it was a picturesque trip. The 
Scandinavian countries, I don't remember which

08:40.391 --> 08:45.538
one it was, might have been your ancestors. 
engineers that carved out those tunnels, and they

08:46.447 --> 08:50.773
go up this mountain. You can travel for about 30 
minutes, and on the map, you haven't made any

08:50.793 --> 08:56.501
progress, just altitude. You can look back down 
and see where you were 30 minutes before. And then

08:59.385 --> 09:03.430
you go through the mountain, and you go on the other 
side, and you do the same thing to get across the

08:59.385 --> 09:03.430
mountain. The people up and down had no idea that 
the Shah's train was coming along there. Or was it

09:13.524 --> 09:14.305
the Shah? Of course, I imagine the railroad. 
clearing it, but I got the word out. But because it

09:19.070 --> 09:26.520
was a Shah's train at the station where we stopped, 
people would come up with flowers to put on the

09:19.070 --> 09:26.520
train. And how they got the word while we were 
sitting there, I don't know. But of course, the

09:30.786 --> 09:31.848
Shah went there. General McClure was there, and 
then McClure and Meany, and yours truly. And so to

09:37.115 --> 09:44.905
me, that's not evidence of an unpopular 
individual at all. Well, what about that charge

09:46.032 --> 09:55.222
about Mosaddegh and that it would have had 
so-called democracy back in 1951 or 1952? What

09:55.242 --> 09:58.105
about that? Mosaddegh didn't have any following 
nationwide. He had some following in Tehran, but

10:03.070 --> 10:12.560
he was a good friend of our nation. Ambassador 
Henderson support him. In fact, we're the ones who

10:16.013 --> 10:19.457
helped him escape. Yeah. You know him? He's a real 
fine guy. Yeah, he was ambassador at the time. We

10:28.888 --> 10:36.777
helped him escape from his house when he was 
attacked and helped him get into hiding. And so

10:38.338 --> 10:44.085
regardless of how the outcome would have been, the 
United States would still have been friendly to

10:44.690 --> 10:45.711
that government. It's not like Khomeini and all of 
that sort of thing. Of course, I guess that's what

10:47.894 --> 10:56.286
good diplomacy is, when you have a favorable 
situation where regardless of which way the

10:47.894 --> 10:56.286
outcome. But

10:57.328 --> 11:07.562
if the Shah hadn't returned, I think we would 
probably end up with a friction just like we have

10:57.328 --> 11:07.562
now. But see, there wasn't a period of purging like 
Khomeini did. See, anyone who's Western

11:14.525 --> 11:20.372
educated, and that's all you doctors and lawyers 
and you educate and so forth, they purge them.

11:21.674 --> 11:24.898
They're either out of the country or in jail or 
dead. So I really couldn't predict what would have

11:26.119 --> 11:30.265
happened then if Shaw hadn't returned. But he 
didn't permanently leave. He left, and it's true

11:33.769 --> 11:38.755
of the reports, I wasn't with CIA at that time. I was 
later on, which we'll talk about. But he left

11:41.959 --> 11:44.262
temporarily. on our suggestion so that this 
overthrow could occur, which was really

11:46.199 --> 11:56.193
bloodless. A few people got killed. They shot up 
Mosaddegh's house with a tank. Who engineered

12:00.019 --> 12:03.964
this overthrow? General Bakhtiari, the same 
division commander that I was telling you about. I

12:08.711 --> 12:09.713
should say he supported. He provided the troops. 
He was really occupying Tehran and getting

12:13.418 --> 12:19.226
Mossadegh out. Nobody hurt Mossadegh. It was very 
embarrassing to us. I knew nothing about the CIA

12:24.153 --> 12:26.115
working. You had to have funds and somebody that 
was working. But the Iranian CIA, like a lot of

12:28.879 --> 12:34.547
people think, American goes in and he leads the 
charge. Well, you don't. It's all by contacts.

12:40.267 --> 12:51.618
We were embarrassed, at least I was, because the 
best regimental commander we had in Tehran,

12:40.267 --> 12:51.618
he had the responsibility to put the security on 
Mosaddegh area. So he discharged his

12:53.220 --> 12:57.024
responsibility. And so it was his tanks that was 
defending Mosaddegh's house. So he ended up by

13:03.871 --> 13:09.136
being arrested and put in prison, see, because he 
was doing what he was supposed to. He didn't stay

13:09.156 --> 13:10.257
there very long. But he was doing exactly what he 
was supposed to do, and he was doing a good job. But

13:13.270 --> 13:13.911
that was earlier. The only bloodshed was the 
exchange between this colonel's forces and

13:13.971 --> 13:22.959
General Bakhtiari's forces. So the Shah was in 
Rome. He came back. I guess a lot of people out in the

13:25.982 --> 13:31.046
province didn't even know anything like this 
happened. Of course, a number of people in the

13:31.066 --> 13:38.573
United States recently charged that the CIA 
really engineered the overthrow. and brought the

13:39.346 --> 13:41.128
shawl back. Well, that's true. That's true. It 
would never have occurred if CIA hadn't been

13:46.533 --> 13:50.697
involved in it. Well, what specifically was their 
involvement? Well, they provided the money and

13:54.961 --> 14:08.374
the contacts and the assurance that the United 
States would support Bakhtiar if he overthrew,

13:54.961 --> 14:08.374
well, much overthrowing, just getting rid of 
Mozadegh. Because the modules wasn't properly

14:09.772 --> 14:28.659
elected, half of them were appointed by the shahs, 
and the other half, like the lower and the higher

14:09.772 --> 14:28.659
house that we have, they were

14:09.772 --> 14:28.659
so-called elected, but even they were more 
appointed. They've had an election here

14:29.701 --> 14:31.403
recently. I mean, those people actually voted. 
But this other way that... What was your opinion

14:36.198 --> 14:41.865
toward this interference in another country's 
internal affairs? Well, I think it was the best

14:43.888 --> 14:53.940
interest of the United States for the Shah to 
continue to be, because I'm sure that that country

14:43.888 --> 14:53.940
would have gone communistic because the Tudor 
party was gaining control. That's the reason why

14:54.040 --> 14:57.284
they had to overthrow the government. Vostok had 
to turn to the Tudors. That was the only one he had

14:59.006 --> 15:02.050
left. And the USSR thought, this is it now. We're 
going to get Iran. Because who is going to stand

15:07.518 --> 15:12.143
between us then? Do you remember what Ambassador 
Henderson had to do, what the ONZ had to do with

15:12.163 --> 15:16.748
this? Oh, he'd have to have complete knowledge. 
You couldn't go in and operate without him. We had

15:23.335 --> 15:24.457
members of the CIA. In fact, a friend of mine I 
didn't know at the time was on this. Ambassador

15:29.242 --> 15:32.846
Henderson's staff, he's a military type. He was 
there as a civilian. He was a contact, in other

15:36.779 --> 15:41.843
words, between Henderson and the CIA. And also, 
the faction also used in that was a, Tehran has

15:41.943 --> 15:50.251
athletic clubs that are very popular. You know, 
the old ancient,

15:50.271 --> 15:57.197
really some art more than anything else. And the 
Shah is a member of that. Of course, he heads all of

15:59.839 --> 16:01.761
them. So they were all pro-Shah. The country was 
pro-Shah. There's no question in my mind. People

16:08.228 --> 16:14.376
are trying to rewrite history and judge the Shah 
later, like, with what occurred then. It's just no

16:14.476 --> 16:15.838
comparison at all. Why do you think the Shah seemed 
to lose popularity

16:16.278 --> 16:25.410
over the next generation? You mean... Yeah, why do 
you think that if you think he was popular in the

16:28.619 --> 16:36.591
early 50s, why was he so unpopular by the late 
1970s? I think we contributed, the United States

16:36.811 --> 16:39.455
contributed to that. When we were there, it was 
only internal security, see, those were the

16:40.737 --> 16:47.347
forces. Later on, and of course he's modernized, 
things were getting better there. But I think what

16:53.937 --> 16:55.639
really contributed most to his downfall is when 
the United States says, now we're going to look to

16:55.940 --> 17:06.469
you to be the strong man in the Middle East. No 
longer we expect you to maintain internal

17:08.711 --> 17:11.934
security. Obviously, you can do that. But we need 
someone who can sort of be the peace enforcer in the

17:14.035 --> 17:25.305
area, suggesting that perhaps you get modern 
aircraft and modern Navy, which they did. did

17:26.095 --> 17:35.265
have, then you would be in a position to utilize 
this force if needed in other parts of the Middle

17:26.095 --> 17:35.265
East. But mainly, you would be a deterrent, being 
strong, that no one would perhaps attack, say, in

17:35.865 --> 17:50.420
Saudi Arabia or

17:35.865 --> 17:50.420
Iraq. Of course, Iraq was always the last people 
when we were there. They were leaning towards the

17:53.203 --> 17:55.005
USSR.

17:57.331 --> 18:11.565
But it's no doubt in my mind that Mossadegh was 
forced to turn to the Tudor party, and he would

17:57.331 --> 18:11.565
never have been able to turn loose of that tiger 
that he had to the tail. Now, one might say, well,

18:13.286 --> 18:19.652
maybe that would have been better, but it 
wouldn't, because the USSR would be on down the

18:13.286 --> 18:19.652
Persian Gulf. They'd have a puppet government 
there, just like they try to have in Afghanistan.

18:25.259 --> 18:28.683
See, all they have to do, they have a treaty with 
them now. All they have to do is to say, help. I think

18:31.326 --> 18:33.689
that goes back to 1921, isn't it? You're the expert 
on history. And some are fearsome now that this may

18:37.433 --> 18:40.317
occur. The USSR said, well, we're invited to come 
down. They needed our security. Turmoil,

18:46.724 --> 18:48.126
anarchy. The government existed to ask for help. 
What about the internal security, the whole idea

18:52.208 --> 19:00.457
of internal security over the last 25 years? Many 
people have charged at the Shaw, built up the

19:00.477 --> 19:09.387
secret forces, secret service forces, and then 
started to torture people, and you've heard it

19:00.477 --> 19:09.387
all. And I was wondering about our role back in the 
early 1950s as far as helping him set up internal

19:09.808 --> 19:21.861
security and if we knew any of this torture was 
going on. No. Not when I was there, because they

19:24.147 --> 19:26.649
hadn't advanced to that point. See, we didn't even 
have advisors in the field, I think. We were all in

19:30.833 --> 19:32.094
Tehran. And when you say we, how many were there? 
Oh, I guess our mission there, we had about 30, and I

19:36.198 --> 19:45.647
guess there were about 10 others in the MAG, the 
Military Assistance Group. That includes

19:45.667 --> 19:49.350
officers and non-commissioned officers. And so 
the training all was occurring in the Tehran area.

19:56.226 --> 20:00.070
Those would come from the province and would come 
in to school that we established. And we were just

20:00.110 --> 20:01.992
getting them established. We were also sending 
officers to the United States. And you had two

20:05.856 --> 20:07.698
factions in the armed forces. Previously, they 
had been going to France to school. French was the

20:10.902 --> 20:13.004
second language. They went into English also. But 
a lot of them didn't speak English. So then, before

20:17.649 --> 20:20.012
they go to the United States, of course, speak 
English. And there were a lot of, a lot of them were

20:22.622 --> 20:29.069
resentful of Americans because they didn't like 
the British. Of course, they, English speaking,

20:29.649 --> 20:32.713
and here we come in. And they sort of identified us 
with the British rather than France. But, now the

20:37.538 --> 20:48.951
other thing besides this building up to Shaw, this 
tremendous American population had moved in

20:37.538 --> 20:48.951
there. Yeah. Now, they even resented us when we 
were there in small numbers. See? Do you have any

20:55.666 --> 20:58.929
examples of resentment? Well, you know, we 
provided transportation. Our government did. We

21:04.094 --> 21:10.619
had Chevrolet sedans and had license, Iranian 
license plates on them. And so one day, my driver

21:12.421 --> 21:19.767
was sitting waiting, and this Iranian officer 
came up and says, I'm taking over this car. I want to

21:22.983 --> 21:23.724
go somewhere. He said, but you can't. This is 
Colonel Andrews' car. He said, I don't care. So he

21:30.152 --> 21:33.897
forced the driver to drive it off, of course, in the 
report. He thought that was an Iranian car. He

21:35.980 --> 21:40.366
thought their government had bought this car for 
us, which it wasn't. It was our own car. And they

21:42.209 --> 21:46.935
just resented us having a sedan, and they rode 
around in Jeeps.

21:50.307 --> 21:52.229
That's one example. Now, what about this thing 
about internal security? We really didn't help as

21:55.692 --> 22:04.500
far as building up this police force. You're 
talking about Savick, huh? Yeah. One other, by the

22:08.403 --> 22:19.053
way, after Mosaddegh was overthrown, there were 
plans that were found for the assassination of

22:08.403 --> 22:19.053
America. Of Americans? Yeah. Us, we lived up at 
Tajri Circle, for example, and the plan was how

22:20.497 --> 22:28.267
they were going to take care of us. And, of course, 
we had vehicles we kept there. We had an evacuation

22:30.090 --> 22:36.859
plan for if we had to get to Tehran Air Base to be 
evacuated. So not only do I say that if it didn't

22:36.879 --> 22:49.896
turn out successful, even though Loy Henderson 
was being very friendly with Mossadegh,

22:36.879 --> 22:49.896
something might have happened to the American 
population that that were there. And I'm sure the

22:52.304 --> 22:56.429
USSR, just like we had CIA, they also operating in 
there. And they probably would desire to have some

22:56.489 --> 23:04.259
Americans killed, because that would indicate 
that Ronnie was unhappy with them, and they were

22:56.489 --> 23:04.259
unwelcome. They shouldn't have ever been there. 
But they had, of course, a security force,

23:06.462 --> 23:14.953
clandestine, no doubt, that we were there. But I 
wasn't aware. because I wasn't around the country

23:18.496 --> 23:22.300
of any other people put in jail. Now, the Iranians, 
they mistreated the troops. They'd slap them and

23:26.263 --> 23:27.905
kick them. And even at that time, they could 
denounce somebody, and they wouldn't have a

23:27.925 --> 23:31.168
trial. They'd go put them in, and they'd stay in 
there for weeks and months, just like they're

23:31.188 --> 23:37.734
doing now, except now they're killing them. In 
other words, the same Iranians, what they're

23:37.754 --> 23:41.878
doing now, were Iranians, what they were doing 
then. The other was the Shah's force. Now, at least

23:44.100 --> 23:47.423
the Shah never did say, go out and kill these 
people. He claims he wasn't even aware if it was,

23:48.922 --> 23:52.547
and I don't think he was. But he's responsible 
because his people did it. But they're brutal as

23:57.494 --> 24:02.081
long as they have the upper hand. And they like to 
have turmoil. Even when we were there, they'd say,

24:07.088 --> 24:12.255
let's go down to the bazaar and have a shalook. A 
shalook there, you know, it was marching and

24:12.275 --> 24:17.342
yelling, waving their hands, yelling slogans. 
And they push each other. They call that a chaluk,

24:19.565 --> 24:23.930
you know, organ and all that sort of thing. In fact, 
we even had an Iranian officer told me one time he

24:23.950 --> 24:31.519
didn't want to fly with the Iranian pilots because 
the landing and takeoff is a chaluk. They even

24:31.840 --> 24:35.484
disagree on what they're doing on getting the gear 
up and landing. He said, I'm going to go fly with

24:35.504 --> 24:37.426
them. No, they like chalukes. That's the reason 
you see them all. And then you give them a TV camera.

24:41.932 --> 24:44.255
They really like to demonstrate. They all want to 
be martyrs. You know, they beat themselves. Yet

24:47.681 --> 24:54.750
they take animal blood and put it all over them, you 
know, and beat as if, boy, they beat themselves and

24:47.681 --> 24:54.750
they're just bleeding all over. When they have a 
technique where they hit here instead of the

24:55.451 --> 25:01.058
chain, you know, hit there. Very emotional 
people, I think. Difficult to really understand.

25:10.370 --> 25:11.852
Tell me about Lloyd Henderson. What type of man was 
he? A real... I think a model diplomat,

25:14.596 --> 25:25.528
soft-spoken ability.

25:25.828 --> 25:38.702
He told us one day, he says

25:25.828 --> 25:38.702
he was laughing because the USSR just experienced 
a setback. I think the Iranians kicked out one of

25:38.722 --> 25:43.067
their diplomats there. And he laughed and he said, 
the secret weapon the Iranians have that the USSR

25:43.925 --> 25:53.815
just can't figure them out. Well, everything I've 
been discussing, nobody else can really figure

25:53.835 --> 25:57.919
them out because they're unpredictable. The Shah 
wasn't unpredictable. That's the reason I think

26:02.584 --> 26:06.268
he was a real stabilizing force. He was popular. 
But when he got all of this equipment, brought in

26:08.290 --> 26:13.695
all of these Americans, and they set up their own 
community, and ignored the Iranians, except the

26:14.350 --> 26:19.677
rich, wealthy Iranians. They had resentment.

26:25.705 --> 26:27.268
That should never happen, but he had to do that. You 
bring all this sophisticated equipment,

26:27.308 --> 26:31.013
Iranians can't operate. Now, you said before that 
you were later with the CIA. Was that in Iran? No.

26:38.903 --> 26:40.105
I'd like to leave in Iran. And I didn't even know my 
friend was a CIA until I joined the CIA. Where it

26:44.350 --> 26:48.336
says support group on that thing, that's a cover 
for CIA. Oh, okay.

26:53.063 --> 26:56.969
Were you happy to leave Iran in 1954? Well, after 
two years, yeah. My wife Mimi had a couple of

26:59.372 --> 27:04.900
operations. Of course, she had to leave Iran and go 
to Germany to do that. About two years. I had a lot of

27:11.337 --> 27:15.262
Iranian friends, and we enjoyed it very much. Very 
frustrating. Why? Trying to get things

27:20.669 --> 27:24.635
accomplished.

27:24.655 --> 27:31.824
You know, Americans, I also want to read Americans 
were unpopular with some of the Iranians because

27:24.655 --> 27:31.824
we were impatient. You know, Americans want to do 
things and get it done. They want to be able to mark

27:35.769 --> 27:40.956
your progress and have a chart up there. And I think 
we made some progress, but not near what you would

27:41.932 --> 27:47.958
expect in two years. We established schools. We 
couldn't get the Iranians to agree to set up an

27:51.621 --> 27:55.585
officer candidate school. Yet their military 
academy, just like ours, could not produce

27:55.645 --> 28:00.930
sufficient officers. So many of the units were 
understaffed with officers. And they didn't want

28:06.416 --> 28:07.897
warrant officers. And their argument was, if you 
have warrant officers, Officer candidates, they

28:11.159 --> 28:16.184
had third lieutenants there. Said if you make them 
third lieutenants, they'll want to get promoted

28:16.204 --> 28:22.971
like everybody else. And they wanted them to 
remain a second-class citizen. They would deal

28:29.598 --> 28:36.185
with them or view them as just a sergeant with 
officer rank. Yet, when you send them to school,

28:39.458 --> 28:43.204
They're more knowledgeable than the so-called 
military academy drivers. So they're even

28:43.264 --> 28:44.726
jealous of each other. It sounds to me like this is a 
tremendous problem of two different cultures not

28:44.746 --> 28:54.541
being able to understand each other. Is that 
right?

29:00.410 --> 29:03.696
Yeah, you could probably say that. Now we've got 
them educated in the United States, and they come

29:03.716 --> 29:07.221
back. They'd be an entirely different person. 
They then were your close friends. They felt

29:12.644 --> 29:14.727
closer to you than they were on you.

29:17.752 --> 29:18.914
Let me give you another example. We sent a lot to 
Fort Sam Houston here, to the Brook Medical

29:19.015 --> 29:33.940
Center, to take medical specialists, a little bit 
more than medical aid men, but at least they were

29:19.015 --> 29:33.940
laboratory people. They'd come back. They'd hang 
up a shingle, go into practice, call themselves

29:36.918 --> 29:41.843
doctor and operator. Now, I'll tell you another 
example. Many of them didn't want to come back and

29:46.087 --> 29:48.169
didn't come back. They'd come back. They'd remain 
over here. One day, we were looking for an

29:52.793 --> 30:03.263
individual who had been over here to medical 
school, to specialist training, not in the

29:52.793 --> 30:03.263
medical school. And it's traced him down. Of 
course, we use the FBI here in this country to

30:05.563 --> 30:08.649
locate these people. And their embassy wanted to 
find him, the Iranian embassy. And they found this

30:13.519 --> 30:18.268
individual of all places. He was a resident in 
Mayo's clinic. Mayo's clinic? Yeah. He convinced

30:28.893 --> 30:35.163
him, he was an exchange student, you know, that he 
had finished medical school, and now he was time

30:28.893 --> 30:35.163
for his residency. And they didn't take the time, 
you know, they looked at all his papers, and of

30:35.784 --> 30:42.153
course they do have him, have him right. And he was 
there, and they said he was doing a pretty good job,

30:42.173 --> 30:49.625
but man, he was practicing medicine in the 
hospital, in a big hospital. So then it stopped all

30:50.346 --> 30:52.048
of that, of course. It went out to all of the 
hospitals where they really had to be sure they

30:52.149 --> 30:56.335
documented it. So I'm not surprised that our 
Iranian students here, they act just like

30:58.593 --> 31:03.320
Iranians. Here at the university now, they have 
demonstrations now, pro-Komanian,

31:03.340 --> 31:08.688
anti-Komanian. And yell insults, shalooking at 
each other. And get mad at the Americans, because

31:11.832 --> 31:16.759
we won't take sides. The students there say, to 
hell with you. Why don't all of you go back? Now,

31:20.885 --> 31:23.930
they aren't pro-Shah. I don't mean to say that. 
They're against Komanian. I guess there'd be some

31:27.162 --> 31:31.547
of them in Alpha Bandar songs. Well, you want to 
move on to another country? This is really

31:34.390 --> 31:36.792
fantastic. It appears to me that this seems that 
this is a very frustrating assignment for you.

31:44.701 --> 31:45.622
Yeah, I want to tell you. Well, I enjoyed it because 
it was a challenge, but yeah, it's frustrating. It

31:49.006 --> 31:52.470
kind of gives you ulcers, you know. But 
fortunately, we all do, and my commanding general

31:52.490 --> 31:55.633
there is a bit We're all in it together and doing the 
best we can. Well, Zimmerman first and then

31:59.045 --> 32:03.150
McClure, General McClure. I want to tell you one 
other thing so you better understand that, at

32:03.170 --> 32:07.295
least on the ground. Everything is done in Iran 
involves Bakshis. Now, just like in the Far East,

32:15.163 --> 32:19.929
it would be Kamsha, you know, but Bakshi. Now, 
Americans might call it TIPS. And the lawyer might

32:25.668 --> 32:27.610
call it a bribe. And this is where we've tied the 
hands of industry here in our nation because we can

32:28.251 --> 32:36.442
no longer pay these fees, which is really bocce. 
But that's the way they do business. Now, when we

32:39.485 --> 32:46.514
first arrived there, there's a policeman up at 
Tawdry Circle. And you say, well, then our house

32:46.534 --> 32:48.897
was right there. It would be safe. Now, it's only 
safe if you do this. You go to this policeman and you

32:54.068 --> 33:02.159
say, now, I live here and it's very important that I 
don't get robbed. Now, I know that you are really an

33:03.241 --> 33:12.834
outstanding enforcer of the law and nothing like 
this would happen with you here on your post. But

33:12.854 --> 33:23.248
for me to show my appreciation of your high 
standard of law enforcement, I'm going to give you

33:12.854 --> 33:23.248
each month This Bakshi's here. Of course, he's got 
his hand out at all times when he gets it. Now, he

33:33.309 --> 33:39.695
keeps the crooks away from our house because 
they're all organized. Now, if I didn't do that,

33:40.596 --> 33:45.040
the crooks come to him and he gives him Bakshi. And 
he'll tell him the hours we keep, everything about

33:46.301 --> 33:50.946
it. Do they have a dog? and then you get robbed, see? 
Also, of course, in their religion, just like in

33:57.843 --> 34:09.674
Saudi Arabia where they cut off hands and legs and 
so forth, there it's not only against the law, but

33:57.843 --> 34:09.674
it's against their religion. But they 
rationalize that. They view them as being like

34:12.677 --> 34:17.882
Robin Hood, sort of an honor among thieves. We will 
only steal from the wealthy, those who have rather

34:17.902 --> 34:23.087
than wealthy. And we will leave all you poor folks 
alone. So they say, well, we don't have much. Al has

34:30.162 --> 34:31.304
not been kind to us. Why shouldn't he? Of course, 
all Americans were hunk of sugar as they have ever

34:32.065 --> 34:35.190
were. We were all wealthy, see. But we never got 
robbed, because I had sense enough to learn when I

34:36.852 --> 34:40.658
got there. He got degrees of Palmer. Now, that's a 
bribe. But maybe it's a tip, because he makes so

34:44.424 --> 34:47.328
little money. And do you remember how much it was a 
month? No, I think it's equivalent of about $5 or

34:54.016 --> 34:58.000
something like that, which was a lot of money there 
at that time. And they have a thieves market then. I

35:02.165 --> 35:03.867
don't know what they have now. And I mean a real 
thieves market. Here, you know, it's a joke. You go

35:06.349 --> 35:10.013
buy secondhand goods and so forth, and they call it 
a thieves market. They steal your hubcaps, even

35:10.914 --> 35:16.160
maybe your tires if you don't have them guarded and 
locked up. You don't dare park your car out in the

35:16.580 --> 35:18.802
street overnight. If the car is still there, it'll 
be stripped. But if you'll hurry and go down to the

35:22.417 --> 35:31.710
thieves market, you can buy back all this 
equipment at really a good price. They'll make you

35:31.730 --> 35:33.472
a good deal on this thing. And you go to the police 
and you say, but they stole it and I found it down

35:34.674 --> 35:37.979
there. Well, first, he doesn't understand the 
language. He doesn't know what you're talking

35:40.943 --> 35:42.305
about. And you say, well, I've got my mark on this 
tire here. He says, yeah, over here. You finally

35:49.274 --> 35:50.596
get an interpreter. What did he say? He says, a lot 
of tires have marks like that. How do I know that's

35:57.011 --> 35:58.473
his mark? So they're all involved with that, too. 
But you'd rather buy it and get it back at a good

36:02.797 --> 36:07.181
bargain price. And they all know that. That's the 
way they operate. You can call it dual standard or

36:09.183 --> 36:12.947
back. But if you don't understand all of that, 
another thing, you can go to an individual, and you

36:13.948 --> 36:21.735
say, I need this.

36:22.846 --> 36:25.669
Oil and stove, for example. But you're wasting 
your time if you try to go down and shop. But you tell

36:28.213 --> 36:32.178
him how much you want to pay. Mr. Maynard was our 
great contact man. He could get you reals at a rate

36:34.560 --> 36:38.666
that you couldn't get at the bank or anywhere else. 
He could get you a stove cheaper than you can get

36:38.686 --> 36:41.769
anywhere else. And he could expedite it. But 
that's the way to do business. Everything's

36:44.873 --> 36:47.316
bordered. And they do steal from the wealthier 
runners, just like they do from Americans. I'll

36:52.006 --> 36:56.872
tell you one more on this, and then we'll move on to 
another thing. We were telling about, one of our

36:56.892 --> 37:08.546
Americans got robbed, and I was telling the 
minister of defense, we were at a party, about

36:56.892 --> 37:08.546
this. He said, we got robbed? I said, really? I 
wouldn't think you people would go. Oh, yes. He

37:14.494 --> 37:15.735
said, just the other night. And they lived just 
like we had. It's a compound with a big high fence.

37:20.172 --> 37:26.500
And, of course, you ring the bell outside, and 
surely a servant comes and answers that during the

37:20.172 --> 37:26.500
day. And the servants and the rich people live in 
the back. And, of course, you lock the doors in the

37:30.264 --> 37:34.530
big houses. We didn't have an overnight servant. 
We had a woman who worked for us during the daytime

37:37.293 --> 37:44.221
and had a yard man to take care of the yard and the 
garden. But he said just the other night, I was, we

37:46.748 --> 37:55.080
were in bed, and I heard a pounding on my door. See, 
they'd already gotten over the fence. They didn't

37:58.204 --> 38:00.908
ring the bell out at the door, at the gate. And he 
said, I went to the door and opened it, and I said,

38:02.270 --> 38:08.118
what are you doing beating on my door this time of 
the night? He said, I beg your pardon, I apologize.

38:11.963 --> 38:12.584
Well, who are you? He said, I'm a thief. I have come 
to rob you. Well, why are you beating on the door if

38:16.229 --> 38:19.194
you're going to rob me? He said, because I need your 
help, because my partner has fallen in your well,

38:19.214 --> 38:24.984
and I can't get him out. So he said, okay. So he went 
and helped this guy get his partner out of the well.

38:31.334 --> 38:34.319
I guess they reinforced a rope or something, and 
they got him out. And he just bowed and thanked him

38:35.080 --> 38:38.045
very much. He said, thank you very much for helping 
us out. We won't rob you. So he says, goodbye,

38:41.913 --> 38:43.775
thief. So he went his way.

38:50.080 --> 38:54.043
Well, we left Iran and we went to the Armed Forces 
Staff College. Yeah, okay, 1955. And I was hopeful

38:55.945 --> 39:00.048
I'd go to the Army War College. Unless you did 
later. Went later, but of course at that time I

39:01.269 --> 39:11.818
didn't know it because oftentimes if you went to 
the Armed Forces Staff College, then you didn't go

39:01.269 --> 39:11.818
to the other, the National War College or Army War 
College. But that was a real good course, because

39:12.592 --> 39:16.838
there you went Army, Navy, and Air Force, and 
Marines.

39:20.023 --> 39:22.626
And it's not much exciting that took place there. 
It was just a routine school. How long did it last? I

39:28.315 --> 39:31.078
recall that was a five-month course. And it's 
basically aimed at training you to become a staff

39:31.519 --> 39:35.505
officer. That's right. And to operate in a joint 
staff. Sure. It was really to standardize a staff

39:40.199 --> 39:47.690
operation for all of the services. And in part to 
get to know the personnel in the service.

39:55.121 --> 40:04.174
Very enjoyable, of course, in certain acts of 
being in Iran and being with all those people. And

40:04.194 --> 40:06.898
then you went to the Pentagon in intelligence. And 
was this, what, a three-year tour? Yeah. Now let's

40:10.203 --> 40:11.604
talk about that. What does it mean? When the people 
from career management came down and they called

40:12.706 --> 40:31.765
out our assignment, and of course that was a 
support group in Washington, D.C., and I had one of

40:12.706 --> 40:31.765
my classmates came up to me and he said, do you have 
any idea what that is? I said, no, never heard of it.

40:34.027 --> 40:39.012
He said, that's a cover assignment for the Central 
Intelligence Agency. And he said, I tell you, you

40:39.802 --> 40:43.685
turn it down, because you don't have to take it. 
They don't want anybody in the CIA that doesn't

40:43.705 --> 40:46.568
want to be there. He said, because that's a 
graveyard for professional officers of any of the

40:47.489 --> 40:54.515
services. Why was it considered a graveyard? 
Well, I asked him, why do you think? He said,

40:59.079 --> 41:07.826
because I had been there, and there are civilians, 
and many of them are Ivy League civilians, and they

40:59.079 --> 41:07.826
don't like military. And you go get a law 
enforcement report. Of course, I had no idea what

41:10.193 --> 41:13.636
my assignment was going to be. I said, well, I'll 
take my chances. All through my career, I never

41:16.879 --> 41:19.061
asked for an assignment. I never turned down an 
assignment. I'd been fortunate. At the end, I was

41:23.845 --> 41:26.848
still fortunate. So I went to CIA, reported in, and 
my assignment was to the War Plans Division.

41:39.099 --> 41:40.200
And what we did We made plans for the use of CIA 
assets in the event of war. What do you mean,

41:50.068 --> 41:51.289
assets? Agents and organizations, paramilitary 
or guerrilla warfare that they might have in the

41:53.472 --> 42:05.327
area, in the country.

42:06.168 --> 42:32.833
these plans international or did it just deal with 
one or two or three nations or was it basically

42:06.168 --> 42:32.833
plans for the whole our whole cia agents 
throughout the world that's national just our own

42:06.168 --> 42:32.833
no it didn't include uh our ally assets anything 
like that you know we're nato and

42:06.168 --> 42:32.833
on entry to cia of course you have an extensive 
background, although it looked like this Hugno or

42:33.404 --> 42:39.611
whatever his name is, they didn't go very far on 
him, did they? But he was a political appointee.

42:41.833 --> 42:44.055
They probably didn't. Although, look at the job he 
had that was given to God. He was the head of the

42:48.520 --> 42:51.844
clandestine services. So after that extensive 
one, and they really went through my background,

42:53.245 --> 42:59.392
and back to my friend Mr. Nelms, he was still alive. 
They always listed him as one of my references on

42:59.432 --> 43:02.635
anything. They were going through all of that. 
When I went back to Caldwell, they went, what have

43:05.467 --> 43:08.831
you been involved in? Because this wasn't just a 
routine, as they always do in any, including

43:08.891 --> 43:18.220
almost any background investigation. 
Obviously, they don't just go to the ones you list,

43:18.240 --> 43:23.065
because they know that would be fatal. They try to 
find your enemies. People that hardly know you at

43:26.808 --> 43:30.512
all, have you ever heard of them? And I had a 
polygraph test, too, to go into CIA. And that's

43:35.396 --> 43:44.771
very important, because it's not only, of course, 
for communists and the other things, but to

43:35.396 --> 43:44.771
identify anyone who's homosexual, for example. I 
guess now I'm getting the part to be a homosexual,

43:44.791 --> 43:48.357
and I might be an ass then. So as a group, then people 
in CIA, both military and civilian, are a

43:50.540 --> 43:55.367
close-knit group. They know they've all been 
cleared.

44:01.255 --> 44:07.245
They're heterosexual, at least appear to be, as 
well as a polygraph test. And they feel very close

44:07.265 --> 44:10.591
as a family. In fact, they call it a company. That's 
their nickname. Everybody belongs to the

44:12.834 --> 44:15.479
company. Yet even Mimi didn't know what I did, or 
where I was going, really. Even though we weren't

44:23.935 --> 44:36.875
involved really going out in different nations or 
countries, we did have, of course, knowledge of

44:23.935 --> 44:36.875
what was taking place in different countries. 
Only the point is need to know. But any

44:40.380 --> 44:45.288
intelligence, any nation, we've demolished our 
own intelligence.

44:47.812 --> 44:52.339
Every operation is compartmentalized,

44:52.859 --> 45:08.153
vertical and horizontally, to where that if

44:52.859 --> 45:08.153
an operation is blown, it can't be connected 
either, I'll say, horizontal or vertical. So it's

45:10.034 --> 45:11.676
compartmentalized. So you can't let, even in the 
CIA, you don't let people know what's taking place

45:11.696 --> 45:19.563
or planned unless they really have a need to know. 
Now, when you start coming to Congress, and have a

45:23.622 --> 45:25.825
clandestine operations plan. And you tell the 
Congressman, it isn't the Congressman. He's got a

45:29.690 --> 45:30.811
big staff. And you've got people in Congress who 
are just delighted in shooting down anything

45:31.632 --> 45:38.341
because they're against it. Especially if he's an 
ultra-liberal, and this might be in a country that

45:39.042 --> 45:46.491
he identifies his political leanings towards. 
But I wasn't involved. I mean, I wasn't in any

45:49.486 --> 45:50.728
country. I wasn't an agent. What exactly did you do 
in the war plans division? Make plans for war in

45:55.735 --> 46:00.923
each country. So in case, for example, a war broke 
out in Poland, then the CIA would have... No, no,

46:00.943 --> 46:09.096
no. That's carrying it a little bit too far. These 
are really friendly areas of the country. For

46:15.706 --> 46:16.427
example, in Vietnam, or in Korea, things of that 
nature. And each of the major headquarters have a

46:21.467 --> 46:26.853
planning group also. This was a national planning 
group, then CINCPAC had one, NATO had one. Were

46:34.002 --> 46:40.150
these basically military plans, or evacuation 
plans, or strategic plans, or what? Military

46:40.170 --> 46:41.672
plans. Well, they had an evacuation plan, but that 
wasn't part of ours. That's another staff

46:45.622 --> 46:47.445
complaint. NATO or American. So with this job, you 
must have worked very closely with the military

46:50.289 --> 46:55.538
people in the Pentagon. Joint staff, yes.

47:01.587 --> 47:03.390
But it wasn't Cold War.
