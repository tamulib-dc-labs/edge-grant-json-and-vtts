WEBVTT

00:05.684 --> 00:13.651
Can you tell me any specific tactics that were used 
to improve the mortality rate of the wounded?

00:13.891 --> 00:20.137
Because we had so few casualties, and certainly 
that's due to the quick helicopter rescue. I don't

00:20.157 --> 00:21.538
know if I understand the question. Tactics were 
used to improve the mortality rate? You mean that

00:25.902 --> 00:33.689
somebody got hurt and they didn't die, they were 
successfully operated on? Right. Oh, okay. Yeah,

00:35.418 --> 00:45.747
based on your World War II or Korean War, your 
hospitals were pretty far to the rear and they were

00:35.418 --> 00:45.747
brought back by vehicle or any way they could. 
During the war in Vietnam,

00:46.728 --> 00:52.793
helicopters were brought in. Mostly you had a 
landing area when you brought your people in to

00:53.694 --> 01:03.703
fight, or that landing area was cleared with trees 
and structures. to bring people out. And you did

01:06.095 --> 01:23.337
have people who got out much quicker than World War 
II, got back to the hospital, and were saved more

01:06.095 --> 01:23.337
than what you had in World War II because of the 
helicopter. And you had a lot of sharp people

01:23.357 --> 01:28.243
working in Vietnam, riding on the helicopters. 
Your aid men were doing things keep people alive on

01:34.177 --> 02:02.968
the way flying back, but not only of the 
helicopters transporting to hospitals, but you

01:34.177 --> 02:02.968
had fixed hospitals, I mean built up hospitals in 
Saigon, you had the ARAVAC from Saigon to Guam or to

01:34.177 --> 02:02.968
Hawaii, Tripoli Army Hospital in Hawaii, to the 
hospital in San Francisco, Brooks Army Hospital

01:34.177 --> 02:02.968
here in Texas, so you had Jet aircraft bringing 
them wounded back, so a big improvement than what

02:03.623 --> 02:10.313
you had during World War II. In 1969, 540,000 men 
were in Vietnam, but only 80,000 were actually

02:12.756 --> 02:23.271
involved in combat. Why is that? Well, I'll take 
your statistic, because I don't know the ratio of

02:25.635 --> 02:32.685
which ones were which. I can only surmise that

02:33.138 --> 02:43.088
you had a lot of support people and you had a lot of 
different jobs going on. Like I said before, we had

02:43.749 --> 03:02.908
people who did work back on staff areas to supply 
aircraft, to build airfields, to be advisors to

02:43.749 --> 03:02.908
different types of staff people. I mean, not only 
did we have advisors to fighting combat units, we

03:03.378 --> 03:16.918
had advisors to Army staffs, Navy staffs, and what 
have you in the Vietnamese high command. And I did

03:18.220 --> 03:28.635
know that we had more people not fighting than were 
in fact fighting. I don't know what the ratio was,

03:28.755 --> 03:32.220
but A lot of it was just trying to maintain what we 
had. We had a lot of security people involved.

03:40.009 --> 03:59.749
Whenever you put up, again, going back to the 
tactics we had, whenever you put an installation

03:40.009 --> 03:59.749
up, and we can use Tonsenick Air Force Base or any 
Air Force Base or any kind of supply storage area,

03:40.009 --> 03:59.749
you had to have somebody guard that or that place 
would be gone. You brought in scout dogs or you

03:59.949 --> 04:03.152
brought in guard dogs and you and if it's something 
sensitive you put American security people on it.

04:10.549 --> 04:23.790
You might have Vietnamese with you but if it's 
something that you really want to protect again

04:10.549 --> 04:23.790
not knowing who the players are in some cases you 
put American people on for security so there's a

04:10.549 --> 04:23.790
lot of American people on doing security work. Do 
you ever feel that there was different than other

04:29.018 --> 04:44.921
wars an increased number of supply for comforts, 
like one hot meal a day perhaps, or some things that

04:29.018 --> 04:44.921
were made to make the Americans feel more 
comfortable in daily living. Do you think that was

04:44.961 --> 04:47.084
ever excessive?

04:50.929 --> 04:57.118
I can't say what it was in World War II since I wasn't 
in it, but I read some books on it. think it was the

04:57.217 --> 05:08.588
type of war we were fighting in the jungle warfare 
that we, in fact, tried to make our soldiers as

04:57.217 --> 05:08.588
comfortable as possible when they came back in 
from fighting. Because I was in the supply

05:10.390 --> 05:22.262
business with 101st, we ran out to them like a mini 
PX, PX meaning a little department store where you

05:10.390 --> 05:22.262
get razor blades and candy and cigarettes and 
whatever. We'd put it in the back of a truck or on a

05:26.382 --> 05:29.806
Connex container and fly it. A Connex container is 
a big steel box. We'd fly it out to what we call a fire

05:31.808 --> 05:36.614
base where they'd come back in and rest and 
provide. We also provided different types of

05:36.674 --> 05:42.841
special service shows. Not like the Bob Hope show, 
which they came a little bit smaller shows for them

05:43.321 --> 05:48.267
when they got back in. We provided... picture 
shows for them on these fire bases, and of course

05:52.280 --> 06:18.878
all this you didn't have during World War II, or I 
don't know about it, but you did probably provide

05:52.280 --> 06:18.878
them quite a few things that you probably didn't do 
in World War II, but again it was a type of war I felt,

05:52.280 --> 06:18.878
and also you had a lot of people looking at you all 
the time, public opinion, and Johnny writing home

05:52.280 --> 06:18.878
to his parents who complained to the congressman 
or whatever, I think had a lot of bearing on a lot of

06:19.887 --> 06:39.513
treatment that they've got to bring down the idea 
that all we did was just push him out there, have him

06:19.887 --> 06:39.513
fight for a year, and if they made it fine, they came 
home. There was a lot of people who couldn't take

06:40.834 --> 06:48.865
this type of life, and you read about it all the 
time, about people saying they still... Some of

06:49.587 --> 06:53.731
them play on the idea, but still having 
psychiatric problems and what have you. But when

06:54.191 --> 07:05.182
the soldiers came in for relax and

06:54.191 --> 07:05.182
R&R, they did do a lot for them. We had donut girls, 
such as the Red Cross, would go out there and put on

07:05.742 --> 07:14.971
different types of shows for them if they could or 
provide them. And some of this goes on here in the

07:15.892 --> 07:19.155
United States also. And you and I have the same 
thing. Off of our job, we're watching television

07:22.266 --> 07:27.853
or going out and doing something to relax our mind. 
And we try to do the same thing out there when they

07:28.775 --> 07:40.030
were not actually in combat to provide them with 
some kind of service that they could forget about

07:28.775 --> 07:40.030
fighting. Do you feel this might have been from 
American political pressure, that Americans

07:41.140 --> 07:58.156
were interested in making this a short, 
convenient war?

07:58.176 --> 08:02.200
Well, I think everybody wanted it to be a short war, 
but it never got that way.

08:05.863 --> 08:07.705
I don't know if I really understand your question. 
providing them these services? They felt that

08:10.600 --> 08:12.201
there would be a short war? No. This probably is a 
bad question. But I just felt that Vietnam was

08:15.044 --> 08:22.530
different from my readings than the other wars. 
And I guess it would be since it was so hot and in

08:22.590 --> 08:25.353
jungle. But it seemed like we were spending a lot of 
time on supply when there were men there that

08:25.393 --> 08:31.438
didn't really have to be there. And I just was 
wondering if that was political pressure from

08:31.458 --> 08:36.323
mothers that, you know, we weren't attacked in 
this war. We we went over there to help him out. I

08:39.557 --> 08:43.142
wonder if because of that, it wasn't a national 
crisis. It was something that... Well, I think

08:43.162 --> 08:58.426
most of the people back in 62, 63, even when Kennedy 
was in office, what have you, felt that we did have a

08:43.162 --> 08:58.426
national crisis in this. The domino effect that if 
we lost Vietnam, so would we lose Cambodia and

09:06.359 --> 09:08.481
Thailand, and on and on. I think we're still having 
some problems. We've lost Vietnam. We've lost

09:12.346 --> 09:14.688
Cambodia, that's for sure. Thailand's got all 
kinds of problems.

09:20.034 --> 09:31.907
I think that you will see as time goes by, and we're 
having the same problem with other countries in

09:20.034 --> 09:31.907
South America, that if we don't do something, the 
economy's going to take over. And we can't end up an

09:32.868 --> 09:36.332
island to ourselves. And I think we really thought 
this would probably be a short war. I feel that we

09:42.627 --> 09:47.453
felt that we could just send over advisors. And 
after a couple of years of advising, the South

09:47.773 --> 09:56.023
Vietnamese would take over the fighting. And we 
would pull our advisors out. And they would win the

09:57.825 --> 09:59.668
war. That didn't happen that way. Is there 
anything specifically that you can name as a point

10:07.531 --> 10:15.961
in time where the American people turned from 
approval of the war to disapproval?

10:15.981 --> 10:22.108
Oh, I don't know if I could really say at any time 
that they turned from approval to disapproval. I

10:22.128 --> 10:29.757
think the American people didn't want to get 
involved in it to start with. And

10:30.958 --> 10:36.745
when we start having a lot of casualties, And when 
they saw it on television every night, then the

10:37.838 --> 10:46.745
people said, hey, let's get out of here. Why should 
we fight for Vietnam? We had the same type of

10:49.648 --> 10:59.076
casualties during World War II, but it wasn't on 
television as much.

11:01.878 --> 11:07.643
I think the biggest problem, from my point of view, 
was that the American people never knew where

11:08.517 --> 11:09.578
where the line was. In World War II, when we took 
this country, or that country, or this city, or

11:09.919 --> 11:19.090
that city, you could stick your pins in your map and 
say, hi, we're progressing. In this war, the only

11:20.191 --> 11:33.027
way you could figure out if you're progressing or 
not, and it was unknown if that was even correct,

11:20.191 --> 11:33.027
was how many things you killed, or how many people 
got hurt, or how much equipment. And American

11:33.047 --> 11:36.651
people just didn't realize that, One night you 
might have a piece of the ground, and the next night

11:37.643 --> 11:40.607
you don't have it. So it's hard to stick a pin in the 
map and look at progress. You can look at a

11:44.472 --> 11:47.016
statistical map and see how things go up and down. 
But American people wanted to look, you're

11:47.556 --> 11:50.720
winning this ground. I think they compared the 
Vietnam War with World War II, and there was no

11:51.401 --> 11:56.328
comparison to do.

12:00.874 --> 12:07.583
Did you see a change in the civilian behavior of the 
Vietnamese from the time elapsed between your

12:00.874 --> 12:07.583
tours? Okay, you're talking about Vietnamese or 
you're talking about Americans?

12:16.567 --> 12:16.787
Vietnamese. No, I think, see I had left before the 
fall of Vietnam and the two years I spent there, I

12:16.807 --> 12:37.992
got the impression that the South Vietnamese, the 
ones I had worked with during the year I was there,

12:16.807 --> 12:37.992
were really trying to get out and do something and 
save their country. I'm sure most of the officers

12:40.201 --> 12:54.863
that I worked with are dead now because sitting 
with them and I went home with them, ate in their

12:40.201 --> 12:54.863
home and played with their kids and all that, that 
they were really against the communist way of

12:40.201 --> 12:54.863
life. And I would say that they didn't stop and they 
probably fought to the end. Sure, you read about

13:04.617 --> 13:07.641
stories where certain divisions the south 
viennese fled from way and came back and people

13:07.891 --> 13:25.917
started running to the rear and what have you i'm 
sure that went on but the unit i was with i doubt very

13:07.891 --> 13:25.917
seriously if some of the officers that that i knew 
did anything but die One interesting question is,

13:27.213 --> 13:38.006
did you see evidence of inter-service rivalry 
between the Army and the Air Force, especially in

13:27.213 --> 13:38.006
the responsibility of the helicopters?

13:41.750 --> 13:42.111
No.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.537
Again, I've got to go back to when I was advisor. We 
took help from anybody. When you're an advisor on

13:50.721 --> 13:57.169
the ground and you have no helicopters of your own, 
and that's where we were. We were a security unit.

13:59.436 --> 14:02.240
We had no helicopters asked for from the 
Vietnamese side of the house. A few helicopters,

14:03.181 --> 14:07.305
yes, to pick up the wounded. We had no artillery 
support from the Vietnamese side. We did have

14:11.570 --> 14:17.397
support from helicopters from the 1st Division. 
And we had artillery support from the 1st Division

14:18.258 --> 14:27.949
because I worked out a deal where the 1st Division 
was hunting for a place to put an artillery

14:18.258 --> 14:27.949
battery. And so we gave them some land right in the 
middle of our area. So with the understanding,

14:32.486 --> 14:47.688
which is very obvious, and when I talked to the 
commander, the VD's commander, he thought it was a

14:32.486 --> 14:47.688
great idea, that if you've got an American 
artillery battalion sitting right in the middle

14:32.486 --> 14:47.688
of your area, if they get attacked, they're going 
to start shooting back. If we get attacked,

14:47.708 --> 14:52.535
they're going to start shooting back also because 
we're going to be protecting them. We provide

14:52.555 --> 14:54.177
security for them also. So that worked both ways. 
Uh, we provided infantry security for them and

14:57.848 --> 15:03.994
whenever we needed help, they fired a few rounds 
for us. And, uh, it's hard to really say, uh, why

15:05.375 --> 15:15.124
certain things go on over there. Uh, when you look 
at, in my, in my area, you look, I had one little

15:16.085 --> 15:21.430
small area. I was not on the, um, army command or 
anything else in Saigon. where I could see a big

15:27.548 --> 15:28.610
picture. I was only looking at a small area, I'd 
say.

15:35.861 --> 15:40.327
What was the most frustrating aspect of your 
service in Vietnam? Which time? The first time or

15:42.430 --> 15:43.372
the second time? I guess the first time, we'll 
break it down in two parts. The first time was

15:46.897 --> 15:53.387
trying to get people to do things.

15:55.645 --> 16:13.222
Some of the South Vietnamese soldiers and some of 
the officers

15:55.645 --> 16:13.222
really felt that unless they came up with this 
idea, then it wasn't a good idea. And it was very

16:13.242 --> 16:19.407
difficult for a lot of Americans to try to get their 
ideas over. And I would suppose that some ideas got

16:20.929 --> 16:24.252
over, You had to be very careful with telling them 
to do something without offending them. They were

16:32.364 --> 16:38.292
very cognizant of the fact that it was their 
country. And you never said anything to a senior

16:38.492 --> 16:48.065
officer, a battalion commander, which I advise as 
a senior officer, in front of his soldiers. You had

16:48.566 --> 16:50.188
to always talk to him. away from his people, 
because if you would say anything, why don't you do

16:50.945 --> 17:19.585
this, or go do that, in front of his staff, or in 
front of his office, it'll never get done, because

16:50.945 --> 17:19.585
for him, it's losing face, and they were very 
worried about losing face, but if he thought it was

16:50.945 --> 17:19.585
his idea, you sat in a corner or something and 
talked with him, or you had lunch with him, if you

17:20.375 --> 17:21.837
could stand some of the food they ate. And I

17:22.959 --> 17:37.360
felt that if you could sit down with the officer and 
talk to him and let him think it's his idea or

17:22.959 --> 17:37.360
suggest things and kind of hope he runs with it, 
then you'd probably be all right. But the worst

17:39.082 --> 17:47.715
thing that any of the officers could ever do was 
tell a Vietnamese commander in front of his people

17:39.082 --> 17:47.715
or in front of his staff You should do this. You can 
forget it. It won't get done. The second time over

17:52.372 --> 18:08.215
there, I think, with the 101st Airborne, the 
hardest thing I feel was a frustrating thing was

17:52.372 --> 18:08.215
that during the day, you would be fighting in an 
area or resupplying an area. And it would be a nice

18:09.096 --> 18:11.159
and friendly area. And at night, it could be the 
worst area over there. You really didn't know who

18:16.206 --> 18:18.850
the players were all the time. And I feel, 
personally, I feel that was a big problem with all

18:19.623 --> 18:28.517
the units over there. All the Viennese look alike, 
and they could change any time they want. They

18:34.346 --> 18:36.730
could be on your side during the day, and they'd get 
you at night. You never knew who these people were.

18:39.835 --> 18:41.537
Everybody wore black pajamas. That was a great 
thing. Everybody wore black pajamas. And you see

18:45.203 --> 18:47.807
this guy walking down the road, You didn't know 
whether you wanted to shoot him or not, or at least

18:49.272 --> 18:55.119
pull out your arms. But if you had a red communist AK 
type of a rifle, you were almost sure that that guy

18:55.259 --> 19:03.468
was against you. Most of the South Vietnamese 
soldiers and the, like, reserve units they had

19:05.991 --> 19:18.705
would not carry any VC weapons, because Americans 
were known to shoot first and ask questions

19:05.991 --> 19:18.705
afterwards sometimes. or their own people, 
American helicopters might see them and say, hey,

19:19.563 --> 19:26.533
that's a NVA outfit down there. And somebody might 
call a jury for them or whatever. So they very

19:29.757 --> 19:36.367
seldom ever carried any weapon other than the 
Americans. But I think that's the two of the

19:37.769 --> 19:49.165
frustrating things, is trying to be a diplomat 
with your counterpart and trying to tell who the

19:37.769 --> 19:49.165
players are when you're running around. Now I'd 
like to focus perhaps on some of the civilians of

19:49.651 --> 19:56.018
war. Can you tell me in what ways did the peasants of 
the jungle vary from the people living in Saigon

19:58.240 --> 20:06.790
and more protected communities? Yeah, okay. 
Going back to 1068 again, the year I was over there

20:07.210 --> 20:12.616
as advisor, we were out in the field quite a bit. And 
most of the farmers that or out in the farmland, who

20:19.604 --> 20:30.540
are not in the city or built up areas, all they 
wanted to do, they didn't give a damn, to be

20:19.604 --> 20:30.540
truthful, of who was in power. All they wanted to do 
was form their land and be left alone by both sides.

20:37.952 --> 20:46.945
And that's some of the reasons why during the day, 
again, they were friendly to the Americans or the

20:37.952 --> 20:46.945
South Vietnamese. And when the South Vietnamese 
and Americans left, The VC came in at night, which

20:49.439 --> 20:53.523
was a kind of a normal operation. They were 
friendly to them. They didn't care who was running

20:55.886 --> 20:57.348
the show. Just leave me alone. Let me do my rice 
paddy or grow my whatever they were growing, for

20:58.449 --> 21:08.119
the most part it was rice. And they didn't care who 
was in power. And when you get back in the built up

21:11.823 --> 21:18.130
areas, back in these towns and Saigon, for 
example, yeah, they did. have a feeling for who was

21:18.937 --> 21:26.724
going to be in power, and they were more into the 
politics end of things. But the former out in the

21:27.846 --> 21:33.091
field, as long as his rice paddy grew, he didn't 
care who would run the show. How were the women, the

21:35.673 --> 21:39.236
Vietnamese women, treated? What was their status 
in the Vietnamese culture? Well, nothing like

21:42.860 --> 21:47.104
there are in the United States, that's for sure.

21:49.683 --> 22:01.418
Vietnamese women, for the most part, treated by 
other Vietnamese, I guess you mean,

21:49.683 --> 22:01.418
they were something to be tolerated, you might 
say. There was very few women who were in any

22:02.519 --> 22:07.205
political positions. The women were to bear 
children, and to keep the house clean, work in the

22:08.326 --> 22:19.200
rice paddies,

22:19.754 --> 22:26.180
The role was much less to do what they're told. And 
they even were supposedly to walk behind the man. I

22:30.764 --> 22:38.231
think it's, I forgot what it is now, but it was two or 
three steps behind and two or three steps to the

22:30.764 --> 22:38.231
left or right. I can't remember what it was now. But 
they had really no rules at all. If a male child, if a

22:45.317 --> 22:49.221
parent had children, family had children, and the 
first one was a girl and the second was a boy, the boy

22:50.416 --> 23:00.850
child would have more authority in the family than 
the first born girl child. So the women didn't have

23:01.551 --> 23:04.495
much of a role in anything.

23:07.880 --> 23:12.586
How did you deal with the cultural differences in 
Eastern and Western moms?

23:15.350 --> 23:16.531
Well, I don't think I really did. I worked with my 
counterpart, and I was fortunate that, again, he

23:20.605 --> 23:26.334
spoke English. He had been trained in the United 
States. He had gone to a basic officer's course at

23:28.818 --> 23:32.404
Fort Benning. He was a Catholic, and I'm Catholic. 
So I accompanied him to his church services, which

23:36.410 --> 23:40.056
is the same as mine. Some things they did different 
than what I would see done here in the United

23:42.259 --> 23:46.045
States. But anyway, he was Catholic. I was 
Catholic. And so we got along all right in the

23:48.837 --> 23:52.782
religion aspects. And he took me to his home. And we 
advisors didn't have very much of a home. We had

24:01.432 --> 24:02.914
something provided by the government. But it was 
pretty nice. But we were either with some other

24:04.556 --> 24:14.548
group of American officers, or we were with the 
battalion. And with the battalion, you were

24:14.568 --> 24:16.330
probably in tents. But when you're with other 
advisors in an advisor compound, then we were an

24:16.833 --> 24:28.303
old French hotel of some sort when I was advising. 
But again, they

24:28.504 --> 24:35.730
did their thing. And you tried to learn. I tried to 
learn what they were doing because it was

24:38.673 --> 24:41.495
interesting. I didn't have any cultural 
problems. per se, because I tried to go along with

24:45.942 --> 24:52.891
the things that they showed me. I remember one 
occasion, and this is kind of funny, somewhat.

24:58.678 --> 25:03.204
Again, remember that I didn't understand all the 
Vietnamese I should have understood. We went to a

25:04.966 --> 25:14.498
party, which was a number of senior officers of the 
battalion, and I went to it, sitting next to the

25:04.966 --> 25:14.498
battalion commander, He toasted everybody, and 
he had a glass of something, and I had it in front of

25:15.085 --> 25:25.180
me, and everybody toasted it, and we drank it, and 
it was horrible. Yeah, it was horrible. It looked

25:26.722 --> 25:27.584
like tomato juice. And I said to him, I said, what 
did we just drink? And he says, whiskey, very good

25:34.033 --> 25:36.317
whiskey. And I said, I know, but what's the red 
stuff? I said, that don't taste like tomato juice

25:39.482 --> 25:41.144
to me. He says, oh, no, that's goat's blood. It was 
whiskey and goat's blood. Very good. He says, very

25:47.116 --> 25:48.017
good. I guess you know what we had for supper that 
night? The goat. And he didn't like hamburgers, I

25:53.765 --> 25:57.870
found out, as we went down the road. And so I never 
had to have any more goat's blood, because every

25:58.631 --> 26:09.585
time that he would say anything about goat's 
blood, I would say, well, you didn't eat my

25:58.631 --> 26:09.585
hamburger, so we had a standoff. So I never had any 
more goat's blood.

26:13.760 --> 26:25.592
Do you think America's effort with the war was 
obstructed by any barriers between their way of

26:13.760 --> 26:25.592
thinking and ours, besides what you mentioned? 
Oh, I'm sure there was in some cases.

26:32.319 --> 26:37.804
Again, here, you're talking about the overall war 
that I wasn't involved in. I was involved in a very

26:37.824 --> 26:43.750
small segment, but from what I read, I would say 
that the The American way of life and the Oriental

26:44.928 --> 26:50.377
or Viennese way of life is not the same. They have 
different values and hold different things that

26:51.098 --> 26:55.605
they believe in. And I'm sure that there was 
problems between the Oriental and the American

26:56.026 --> 27:04.439
way of thinking. You can just look at the truth 
conferences that Kissinger ran back and forth on

27:04.900 --> 27:12.792
and everybody else. thinking that they had an 
agreement. No, they didn't have an agreement.

27:15.595 --> 27:16.556
Yes, they did have an agreement.

27:19.279 --> 27:26.065
The oriental outlook, I feel, is they'll wait till 
hell freezes over to get their own way. They will

27:27.066 --> 27:36.355
talk to you and agree with you and agree with you and 
talk to you and smile and everything else. But

27:36.375 --> 27:37.356
they're not going to do it. They don't want to do it. 
It's not going to be done. And I think that's the

27:40.239 --> 27:43.082
same thing that Nixon and Kissinger and all of them 
had. A lot of people agreed with what they wanted to

27:45.656 --> 27:56.954
do, but they only stalled food around until they 
got what they wanted, getting us out of the country

27:45.656 --> 27:56.954
and then taking over.

28:00.920 --> 28:05.928
The media played a big role in the Vietnam War. What 
do you think of the media coverage of Vietnam?

28:08.532 --> 28:11.517
Well, I got involved with one The man who came over 
to Vietnam was Charles Collingwood. I have some

28:15.839 --> 28:16.779
pictures of him. And that was the only time, and 
that was right after Tet, that I'd ever gotten any

28:18.381 --> 28:28.390
type of involvement with firsthand knowledge. 
And I felt Charles Collingwood did a real fine job.

28:31.072 --> 28:35.516
He came over there, and he was with the training 
center. He wasn't with the unit I was with, but

28:35.556 --> 28:41.942
since the training center had another officer 
that was involved, American officer that came

28:42.597 --> 28:45.861
down. So I was working out with him and trying to 
help him set up all this stuff. But anyway,

28:50.386 --> 28:58.836
Collingwood came over and he talked about the 
training and talked about the problems they had.

28:58.956 --> 29:11.271
We knew that we had VCs that we were training 
because the way they would draft people, as I told

28:58.956 --> 29:11.271
you before, go down the street and grab them, we 
knew that people that we were training was on the

29:11.707 --> 29:13.349
other side. For that matter, we were very 
cautious, the sergeant and myself, that we tried

29:14.110 --> 29:23.423
to work together and stay together a lot so that we 
wouldn't get shot from behind. We knew that there

29:25.446 --> 29:29.311
were VCs in the unit. For that matter, at night, the 
trainees would not be given a weapon at night. They

29:35.399 --> 29:40.125
would have a weapon during the day, and we'd give 
them ammunition during the day when they went to

29:35.399 --> 29:40.125
training ranges. But at night, the weapons were 
all taken away from them. And of course we do the,

29:44.408 --> 29:52.039
you know, that's not, that seems kind of unusual 
during wartime, but we do basically the same thing

29:44.408 --> 29:52.039
in the American Army right now. We train during the 
day, men have weapons during the day, and at night

29:52.419 --> 30:06.739
we lock them up in racks down the center of the floor 
of the barracks, or we put them in an arms room, only

29:52.419 --> 30:06.739
because we don't want them to accidentally shoot 
themselves. But over there, the reason behind it

30:06.799 --> 30:11.565
was that you might end up with a couple of, VCs 
running around trying to shoot people. I'm not

30:15.714 --> 30:18.938
sure if you're aware of what happened. At one 
point, the media covered a story where right in

30:18.978 --> 30:33.437
front of American eyes, a Buddhist doused himself 
with gasoline and put himself to suicide. How do

30:34.198 --> 30:39.645
you think the Buddhist religion affected the 
decisions of the country? Well, I thought there

30:40.756 --> 30:43.138
was a very influential group. I also saw a film of 
when the general, the Viennese general shot and

30:43.839 --> 31:01.314
killed a VC in the street, and there was films of 
people doused themselves with gas. I think even a

31:01.334 --> 31:05.999
few Americans in the United States here did 
something like that too. But the Buddhists were a

31:11.182 --> 31:12.543
very influential group. They were just like 
another political party like the Democrats and

31:12.563 --> 31:16.907
Republicans we got. They felt that they could do it 
better and it was a basketball back and forth

31:19.109 --> 31:28.677
between both of them. A lot of your soldiers were 
Buddhist and believed in that way. The priest,

31:36.664 --> 31:40.547
when they came in to conduct services in our units 
when I was an advisor, were carded all kinds of

31:40.865 --> 31:49.414
rights and what have you. Freedom of speech, you 
might say, or religion. And I don't know what they

31:54.299 --> 32:02.869
were saying, but I know that they came in and 
conducted church service or whatever. And they

32:03.429 --> 32:06.172
were a very potent group. The Orientals believe in 
a lot of that, and have different types of services

32:11.476 --> 32:17.382
and holidays and what have you. So they were a very 
potent group.

32:23.109 --> 32:33.239
Do you feel the average civilian of Vietnam was 
aware of the ideals of democracy and their

32:23.109 --> 32:33.239
countries being a testing ground for democracy? 
Do you think they were aware of that? Well, it

32:34.601 --> 32:39.306
depends on what kind of democracy you're talking 
about. I don't think that any of them were aware of

32:40.163 --> 32:45.169
what we call democracy. I think what they were 
looking at, and again, we've got to get back to the

32:47.272 --> 32:57.464
people in the built-up areas, because again here, 
the farmers didn't care about anything but their

32:47.272 --> 32:57.464
farmland.

33:00.107 --> 33:09.799
I felt those who were trying to build a government, 
yeah, they had democracy, but their type of

33:00.107 --> 33:09.799
democracy you could do what you wanted to do as long 
as you didn't do it against the government. Some of

33:18.252 --> 33:31.992
the people in high places over there, I remember 
seeing General Two and a few of the other, General

33:18.252 --> 33:31.992
Key and his wife over there. A lot of people felt 
that they were trying to set themselves up as king

33:32.032 --> 33:37.660
and queen what have you and there was groups 
against them i think

33:38.281 --> 34:03.816
when you start talking about democracy the 
viennese had a different feeling of democracy

33:38.281 --> 34:03.816
than what you and i know it their democracy was stop 
the fighting and get on with life over there and

33:38.281 --> 34:03.816
that the government would have I won't say 
dictatorial powers, but they had a big say in what

34:04.454 --> 34:13.805
the people were going to do, but it would be a 
democratic dictatorial shift, you might say. One

34:16.529 --> 34:29.685
thing that I've learned in studying Vietnam is 
that a lot of times there were just things that were

34:16.529 --> 34:29.685
lost, you know, equipment, but also that there 
were people actively working you know, both

34:30.273 --> 34:36.622
Vietnamese and Americans, that there was a black 
market set up for corruption. Can you tell me

34:37.123 --> 34:39.206
examples? It depends on what you're trying to say 
now. Are you talking about a black market of luxury

34:41.129 --> 34:46.817
items or a black market of supplies for the war? 
Well, both. Yeah, there was quite a bit of luxury

34:48.399 --> 34:51.524
black market items. The Americans were bringing 
in for their soldiers a lot of, post-exchange

34:57.509 --> 35:25.474
items, and I don't know if you've heard of the 
post-exchange, it looks like a Walmart, okay,

34:57.509 --> 35:25.474
doing away with the furniture stuff and whatever, 
you know, stereos like this one here, and

34:57.509 --> 35:25.474
different types of pocket radios, and a lot of 
comfort items, and somehow, some of this stuff

34:57.509 --> 35:25.474
would get ripped off before it ever got to the 
post-exchange, or the beer got stolen, or the

34:57.509 --> 35:25.474
whiskey that they had for the different clubs 
where it gets stolen. Lo and behold, it come up on

35:29.087 --> 35:32.131
the streets. There's a street called Tuto Street 
in Vietnam where all this stuff would appear just

35:32.151 --> 35:36.979
right on the streets. And nobody seemed to do 
anything about it. I mean, you could walk, if you

35:40.724 --> 35:44.330
couldn't find the PX, you walked down there and you 
might find it. You might pay more for it. But yeah,

35:47.695 --> 35:54.465
it was an open black market going on in Vietnam. of 
that type of goods. Of military goods,

35:59.061 --> 36:08.029
I didn't know of any military goods that were sold 
or bought by anybody. I'm sure there might have

36:08.769 --> 36:14.094
been, but there were some accounting problems 
over there I know of. I've heard of one story,

36:14.154 --> 36:24.823
whether it's true or not or not, that the Air Force 
was trying to order all kinds of parts for

36:14.154 --> 36:24.823
aircraft, millions of dollars of parts. And they 
didn't even know it, but they had them already in

36:25.478 --> 36:30.344
their warehouse. And they had a problem in just 
trying to figure out what's in these boxes. And we

36:35.570 --> 36:37.893
had an accountability problem. And they went 
back, and from where I hear it, they had a team that

36:38.634 --> 36:52.431
came over to Vietnam and had to sort through all 
these warehouses they had for aircraft parts to

36:38.634 --> 36:52.431
get everything in line, get them computerized, 
and whatever, so they could figure out what they

36:38.634 --> 36:52.431
had. But the pleasure items, yeah, I saw a black 
marker on that. But the military equipment, I

36:59.044 --> 37:05.232
didn't see anybody doing anything with that 
stuff.

37:07.855 --> 37:15.044
In your opinion, why did the U.S. lose the war

37:07.855 --> 37:15.044
in Vietnam? The bombing escalation? Yeah, I think 
that, and like you just said, I think we lost the war

37:16.246 --> 37:23.515
in Vietnam. I think we just didn't have the will to 
fight anymore. The Army had the will to fight. I

37:33.076 --> 37:39.322
think the American Army, or armed forces, not just 
the Army, had the will to fight. But our

37:40.504 --> 37:51.375
politicians back here in the United States and our 
civilian people back in the United States just

37:40.504 --> 37:51.375
didn't have the will to fight anymore.

37:52.773 --> 37:56.116
We, again, we were not carrying the war to the 
north. We were just staying on our side. We had, our

38:00.320 --> 38:12.691
politicians had made a lot of promises about 
getting the troops out by such and such a day, or

38:00.320 --> 38:12.691
this was gonna, we were gonna get out, win with 
honor, I think one of the cliches were. And I think

38:14.973 --> 38:22.780
the North Vietnamese just said, well, if we keep 
stalling and keep stalling and keep stalling,

38:22.979 --> 38:33.489
between the media and the politicians and the 
civilian side of the house, we can get them out of

38:22.979 --> 38:33.489
Vietnam, we can take over, and that's exactly what 
happened. As soon as the Americans got out, and I

38:34.590 --> 38:50.404
forget now how many months, if it was months, 
everything after the Americans got their last

38:34.590 --> 38:50.404
units out, everything just fell apart. We also had 
a problem on funding, too. At that time, Congress

38:53.927 --> 39:03.097
and whatever was cutting back on funding for arms 
for South Vietnam. And I really feel that the will

39:03.117 --> 39:16.611
to carry the war on to the north on the political end 
of it and the American civilian end of it was, hey,

39:17.519 --> 39:18.320
It's their war. Let the South Vietnamese fight 
their war. Bring our boys home. And if they can't

39:22.905 --> 39:25.808
hack it in South Vietnam, to hell with them. And it 
went about that way. We got our people out, and the

39:28.271 --> 39:31.194
whole thing fell apart. In a general way, what did 
you perceive as your purpose in Vietnam? What

39:39.443 --> 39:40.885
motivated you to be there? Well, I really didn't 
have that much choice. When I raised my right hand

39:46.021 --> 40:00.200
at Texas A&M and said I support the Constitution 
and do what I was told to do by the President, the

39:46.021 --> 40:00.200
Commander-in-Chief,

39:46.021 --> 40:00.200
I had a choice of one, quit in the Army or continue on 
what I wanted to do. I chose to stay in the Army, and I

40:01.181 --> 40:05.447
stayed in there a little over 20 years. So I went 
where I was told. I went to Korea twice. I went to

40:10.413 --> 40:11.555
Vietnam twice. I went to Europe twice. I had some 
good tours in France and what have you. But I went

40:16.463 --> 40:21.888
over there based on I was told to go. And I felt that 
my job over there was to try to, first time I went

40:23.109 --> 40:46.150
over, was try to assist the unit I was assigned to 
have them succeed in their role, the mission to

40:23.109 --> 40:46.150
secure the Air Force base and to secure the 
training center and I felt my role was to assist

40:46.737 --> 40:52.406
that commander in doing that. And I went to an extra 
30 days of school to learn how to try to do that. The

40:58.174 --> 41:05.786
second time I went over was again to support the 
American unit I was assigned to. And it's just like

41:06.887 --> 41:09.912
you going to school. If you don't want to go to 
school, you can quit. say, I don't want to do it

41:15.610 --> 41:16.931
anymore. An Army officer, United States Army, 
after he finishes his required time, whether it's

41:18.413 --> 41:31.206
six months, two years, or six years, or whatever 
else, how he got his commission, if he doesn't want

41:18.413 --> 41:31.206
to do that anymore, then he quits. But I wanted to do 
it. I wanted to continue my career, and I decided to

41:33.789 --> 41:37.753
do it. And I did as best as I could based on what I was 
told to do. Did you voluntarily return to Vietnam,

41:45.563 --> 41:49.689
or was that where you were sent? No, I knew that I was 
ended up at least two or three times. Some officers

41:53.634 --> 41:55.537
were more than that. I voluntarily returned when I 
received a set of orders telling me to go back.

42:02.928 --> 42:03.048
Right. Do you see Vietnam in historical overview 
as a victory in any way for Americans? What do you

42:11.740 --> 42:12.461
think we learned? No, I don't think so. I think that 
most Americans, and if you're talking to

42:13.964 --> 42:29.103
officers, and I would, I can't speak for general 
officers, but for the most part the officers I

42:13.964 --> 42:29.103
know, we really felt that we lost the war. I think 
that we'll probably learn, but some of the things

42:30.685 --> 42:42.300
we're doing right now today probably doesn't show 
we learned too much of it, is that if you're going to

42:42.618 --> 42:48.985
go out and win something or you're going to try to 
win something, you can't do a halfway job. You've

42:49.365 --> 42:52.068
got to get out there and do it all the way. You've got 
to use all your forces to do it. If you're going to

42:55.411 --> 43:09.225
get involved in a warfare where you're going to 
have American soldiers on the ground using all

42:55.411 --> 43:09.225
their combat force, you've got to commit your 
combat force not only on the ground but your air

42:55.411 --> 43:09.225
also. And I feel that If anything, we learn out of 
this thing is that if we ever get involved in a

43:11.339 --> 43:21.211
jungle-type warfare again, we cannot sit back and 
fight in one little area. You've got to go to the

43:21.632 --> 43:26.598
source of where all the problems are coming and 
give them a taste of the war. Colonel Wilcox, I'm

43:28.320 --> 43:33.667
through with my questions, but would you like to 
add anything that you feel important? The only

43:33.687 --> 43:38.933
thing I'd like to add is that all I've told you is my 
personal opinion, and I'm not telling you

43:39.233 --> 43:44.121
anything that's anything classified, as far as I 
know. Most of this stuff you've probably heard on

43:45.343 --> 43:54.538
television already from one source or the other, 
but you can feel free to do anything you want with

43:45.343 --> 43:54.538
it. I just hope I helped you in your classes and that 
my rambling on here that you've got something out

43:55.038 --> 44:04.093
of it. And again, it's just my personal opinion and 
not an official position in the United States

44:05.120 --> 44:12.222
Army. Thank you.
