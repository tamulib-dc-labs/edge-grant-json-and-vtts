00:03.254 --> 00:24.533
Of preparing for a performance,

00:03.254 --> 00:24.533
of a typical performance, what

00:03.254 --> 00:24.533
was the hardest part of the Aggie band halftime to 
prepare for? I think putting the music with the

00:26.314 --> 00:29.717
drill. In other words, you learn the drill, And 
you've got everything. You count the number of

00:34.436 --> 00:37.140
steps in the drill. Then you count the number of 
measures in the music. And you get everything all

00:39.984 --> 00:42.407
set for the grand finale. And then this means that 
you have to cut some of the music off. And getting

00:47.253 --> 00:51.798
everybody to cut it off at exactly the same time so 
it will fit the music. I think that was probably the

00:51.839 --> 00:54.542
hardest part. And like I say, Wednesday was a bad 
day because it took so many times to go over it until

00:54.742 --> 01:02.472
they... they got it and probably half as many times 
as it would have taken any other group but even as

01:03.042 --> 01:27.177
smart and determined and dedicated as these guys 
were we still had some trouble with that but after

01:03.042 --> 01:27.177
usually after about Thursday or Friday then you 
see it all fit in together and by Friday and then

01:03.042 --> 01:27.177
Saturday morning it was usually they would just 
something about that audience and getting the 50

01:27.477 --> 01:55.172
60 000 people whatever we have and getting them all 
together they just really outdid themselves all

01:27.477 --> 01:55.172
right let's make believe that on this 
hypothetical situation it's a comparatively

01:27.477 --> 01:55.172
clear day saturday we've got a home game describe 
what that day was for you and the band when did

01:27.477 --> 01:55.172
things begin and so forth The typical Saturday day 
at home would begin for me about 5, 5 30. I'd have to

02:01.450 --> 02:05.217
be up there at 6 30, 6 45 in the morning. At 6 45 when 
you get there, all of them will be there except

02:05.638 --> 02:13.212
maybe a few seniors who haven't gotten up yet. 
They're in section and the drums are over there

02:13.799 --> 02:23.335
playing the cadence and they're walking up and 
down practicing their counter marches. The drum

02:23.835 --> 02:29.805
majors are usually down on the goal line or 
somewhere, there's some part of the drill that

02:23.835 --> 02:29.805
they're just not quite sure about. They're over 
there working on that. At 7 o'clock we take a break

02:32.509 --> 02:36.917
and we go through the drill sometime. If they do it 
real good, we go through it twice. at 7. If it's not

02:40.606 --> 02:43.310
real good, we stay sometime until 7.45. But if it's 
some of the cross through sometime would give us

02:43.770 --> 02:47.515
trouble. But then usually after we get through 
with that, well then we depart and we go. They'll

02:55.425 --> 03:01.933
have on their fatigues and they'll go get on their 
uniforms and we get ready to go. But now you know

03:01.953 --> 03:03.936
they have the march in over there. That would begin 
about two hours before the game started. I had to be

03:07.991 --> 03:10.097
there so I could meet them. Then we'd have them, 
we'd have the march in and then we'd have the

03:10.678 --> 03:17.316
pregame and then we'd have the game. So you're 
talking say the game started two o'clock you're

03:19.358 --> 03:43.172
talking getting up at 5 5 30 in the morning and 
getting home at 7 6 37 and it's a it's a full day it's a

03:19.358 --> 03:43.172
full day for them and uh I don't I thought many times 
what in the world makes them do this and I think it's

03:19.358 --> 03:43.172
uh dedication and pride and and uh The love for the 
band and their devotion to each other is the only

03:43.557 --> 03:54.208
things that I have come up with as to why they do 
this. There were no scholarships. There were no

03:55.291 --> 03:56.093
pay. No pay involved. And they do it year after year 
after year. And whatever the demand is on their

04:01.506 --> 04:07.193
time, well, then they do it. And I think those 
things have to enter into it. I haven't been able to

04:10.056 --> 04:14.902
figure out, what in the world are they doing this 
for? And that's the reason. There's just an

04:17.525 --> 04:25.714
undying interest in what they're doing and 
devotion there that I have never seen in another

04:17.525 --> 04:25.714
group Anywhere, not just the bandsmen, but the 
Aggie band has had a lot of still does, had a lot of

04:26.268 --> 04:41.307
fine qualities, and few people really understand 
this unless they have been in it. As you think back

04:42.232 --> 04:54.545
over the years that you were the director, what 
were some of the proudest moments in terms of

04:42.232 --> 04:54.545
performances? Were there any that you 
particularly... There is one that particularly

04:57.788 --> 05:01.151
stands out in my mind. We went to the Cotton Bowl in 
1986, I believe, or 1987, and we played Ohio State

05:01.191 --> 05:11.682
University. Ohio State, without a doubt, has one 
of the finest bands in this world, marching bands.

05:19.876 --> 05:32.038
And they're all brass, and most of them are music 
majors, and they really know what, they are just

05:19.876 --> 05:32.038
superb. So I was really looking forward to this, 
and perhaps a little apprehensive because we have

05:37.008 --> 05:49.624
no music majors, we have no, what you would call, 
usually the only playing that most of these guys

05:37.008 --> 05:49.624
get was in the band. So we go up there on the morning 
before the Cotton Bowl performance and we get so

05:50.185 --> 06:02.661
many minutes on the field and the Ohio band goes 
first. and uh we go up in the stands to watch and I

06:03.637 --> 06:29.948
told all the guys in the band to go up and watch them 
and so they they come they come on the field and they

06:03.637 --> 06:29.948
just do an absolutely marvelous job and they they 
end their drill with coming over to the side and

06:03.637 --> 06:29.948
playing climb every mountain and it just it just 
was so pretty it scared me to death so anyway we went

06:03.637 --> 06:29.948
down to the end and Gathered around, as we always 
do, and I told him, I said, now, guys, I want to tell

06:31.497 --> 06:35.503
you something. I told you that I would take you 
anywhere in the United States on any regulation

06:35.523 --> 06:52.046
football field, and I would put you up against any 
band in the world for marching and playing, and

06:35.523 --> 06:52.046
you'll do good. I said, now, this is the time to do a 
little bit better than you know how to do. And so we

06:58.210 --> 07:05.149
come out there and they just really did 
beautifully at the rehearsal. And we had a tune or a

07:05.753 --> 07:19.385
march, a kind of a symphonic march that I had 
arranged for them at the end called Cowbaccade,

07:05.753 --> 07:19.385
which is a very dramatic ending. And we also came to 
the side like we did

07:19.445 --> 07:25.730
quite often. And they played this thing about as 
pretty as anything I ever heard. And so when we got

07:30.534 --> 07:35.338
through and we did it again, I went up in the top and 
and their band directors were sitting up there as

07:35.318 --> 08:03.182
to this day they had done nothing more than say um 
hello how are you I'm so-and-so I'm so-and-so and

07:35.318 --> 08:03.182
this one old kind of short stocky kind of 
bald-headed guy came over there and he said my name

07:35.318 --> 08:03.182
is Mr. is Dr. so-and-so and I didn't know who he was 
he said I am the retired director of the Ohio State

07:35.318 --> 08:03.182
band and said for years now I've been hearing how 
fine this band was and said they are better than I

08:03.162 --> 08:31.313
thought they were that I heard they were and so you 
know that that just made my day so for some reason or

08:03.162 --> 08:31.313
other the the Aggie band and the Ohio State band 
seemed to have a lot in common and they were trading

08:03.162 --> 08:31.313
spats for epaulettes and they were mixing and 
talking and And so that day at that cotton bowl,

08:31.293 --> 08:36.958
that's two of the finest bands I have ever seen. And 
they were just flawless. We did a beautiful deal

08:38.599 --> 08:44.664
where we spread out for a hundred yards and just a 
beautiful drill. And they were, they were, they

08:44.684 --> 08:47.427
were, they were fantastic. And so then when, even 
when we were leaving on the buses after this was

08:47.447 --> 08:56.394
over, when they were still talking and saying 
goodbye and they were writing each other when we

08:47.447 --> 08:56.394
got back in. So that musically speaking, I think 
that was probably the, One of the highlights of my

09:01.364 --> 09:06.240
performance, I don't know of anything I ever 
enjoyed better. All right, let's go to the other

09:06.721 --> 09:08.146
extreme. Somewhere, something went wrong. Yeah. 
We had one of those. Well, we had several where they

09:13.261 --> 09:19.415
went wrong, but this one deal, we went to Rice, I 
believe, in maybe 80 or 81. And Rice is just like

09:19.776 --> 09:26.531
going to another planet, really. They have no 
earthly desire to see you excel. They just want to

09:31.823 --> 09:34.126
mess you up if they can. They'd thrown smoke bombs 
into the band one year and burned a couple of them,

09:34.207 --> 09:40.536
burned their boots. They had that clown running 
around out there on the field running through them

09:41.317 --> 09:45.223
and everything. But this year it was whistles. 
They had probably 150, 200 whistles. And we had a

09:51.853 --> 09:56.059
very difficult, really had a nice drill all worked 
out. everything was going real good until we got it

09:56.377 --> 10:16.005
all they started blowing these whistles right in 
the middle of the field and one half of the bugle

09:56.377 --> 10:16.005
rank turned five yards too soon and uh they of 
course by the time then the other half took six

09:56.377 --> 10:16.005
steps they were already ten steps apart And it was 
one of those deals where we would spread out all

10:16.880 --> 10:25.294
over the field and we did what we called a rocket and 
we had a step one drill where we picked up and then we

10:16.880 --> 10:25.294
made the tee. Well, there was no way in this world 
they could get back together. And we had been

10:29.441 --> 10:37.555
trying for years things on a football field that I 
had never seen anybody else try or do. And I just had

10:38.378 --> 10:45.694
wondered, said, these guys are not

10:38.378 --> 10:45.694
wind-up people. They're wind-up machines. 
They're people. They're going to make mistakes.

10:48.620 --> 10:52.669
And I was just wondering when this, hope it didn't, 
but if it's ever going to happen. Well, it

10:52.689 --> 10:53.350
happened. And when they came, everything looked 
pretty good until they came back to Farmington and

10:54.140 --> 10:58.445
they couldn't do it. Because one group was 10 or 15 
yards down there and they couldn't stop. So they

11:04.353 --> 11:05.314
just left. Well, a lot of Aggies thought that, 
well, this is just terrible. This is the end of the

11:11.862 --> 11:12.984
world. Of course, you can imagine how I felt and how 
all the guys in the band felt. and they made the

11:17.967 --> 11:46.877
Houston papers and the coaches were saying oh my 
goodness the band director was crying well they

11:17.967 --> 11:46.877
didn't even see me they don't know what they're 
talking about but it was a it was bad and they made

11:17.967 --> 11:46.877
but they just simply made a mistake a bad one and 
there's nothing they can do about it so you know

11:17.967 --> 11:46.877
humans make mistakes so anyway we went on in the 
next week I don't remember who we played But that

11:47.633 --> 11:51.687
was probably one of the best drills I've ever seen. 
It was step-by-step. It was absolutely as perfect

11:54.819 --> 11:59.415
as you could ever get it. But a lot of the people just 
remember that, and they don't remember the good

11:59.918 --> 12:07.227
things. And I don't know of anybody in this world at 
one time or other that hadn't made a real bad

12:07.568 --> 12:15.098
mistake. So anyway, we did that. That's about the 
only time I can ever remember. But it's something

12:20.625 --> 12:26.112
that I'm sure a lot of people, and of course I was 
reminded of it for, weeks after that everywhere I

12:26.480 --> 12:30.268
went about the blunder. What about weather? You 
must have encountered some astonishing weather

12:31.590 --> 12:35.037
conditions somewhere. We have marched on Kyle 
Field when it snowed, when there was snow on the

12:35.057 --> 12:39.246
field. We have marched at the halftime whether 
it's rain, mud, sleet. or snow and we marched a

12:45.498 --> 12:52.167
number of times at the Baylor game at Kyle Field 
when the Baylor band wouldn't even march. And they

12:52.989 --> 12:55.592
were in the buses and we were out there marching. We 
went to Arkansas one time and it was so cold that we

12:56.213 --> 13:04.545
couldn't even move the valves on the horns. Those 
guys are pretty tough and it didn't really bother

13:04.665 --> 13:09.171
them much. They just did what they had to do. That 
was the story of their life. They did what they had

13:12.276 --> 13:15.420
to do and wherever it was very little griping and 
fussing and complaining to anybody about

13:15.839 --> 13:42.488
anything so it you know it was a it's like a second 
dedication pride uh and that that that has a lot to

13:15.839 --> 13:42.488
do with it did uh the different head football 
coaches uh express appreciation for the band's

13:15.839 --> 13:42.488
efforts we had we had i think marvelous rapport 
with the football coaches and the athletic

13:43.548 --> 13:55.104
directors and I moved here about the same day or the 
same week that Emory Ballard and R.C. Slocum moved

13:55.124 --> 14:11.766
here in 1972 and we were really dear friends the 
coaches kind of adopted me and they took me fishing

13:55.124 --> 14:11.766
with them and they took me on all these golf 
excursions and fundraising things which I dearly

13:55.124 --> 14:11.766
loved and then Jackie Sherrill was he was really 
really good to us and he came over would eat with us

14:11.746 --> 14:31.138
and he came to band hall on several different 
occasions and wanted to see everything and and

14:11.746 --> 14:31.138
then uh of course rc we hunted together honey quail 
together golf together and uh we were we were very

14:11.746 --> 14:31.138
close friends so I don't know how the relationship 
could have been any better. And, of course, with

14:34.641 --> 14:39.726
Wally Groff, he was not the athletic director 
then, but he was in charge of the money. And, you

14:40.987 --> 14:43.489
know, that can get pretty tight sometimes. And 
Wally and I don't ever recall having a problem that

14:43.509 --> 14:48.854
we couldn't work out. And so I just was so pleased 
with our, well, you know, you can brawl it or fry it,

14:49.714 --> 14:59.623
but if it were not for those football games, and the 
athletic contest. I doubt very seriously we'd

15:02.212 --> 15:04.375
have an Aggie band. Oh I agree. And you know you can 
play all the concerts in the world on all the

15:05.416 --> 15:16.730
concert stages and there's nowhere in the world 
60-70,000 people gonna see you every Saturday

15:05.416 --> 15:16.730
unless you get out there in March. And I've always 
felt that way about high school and certainly in

15:16.750 --> 15:22.257
college. The Aggie band makes their reputation on 
the football field. So those lines better be

15:26.401 --> 15:32.858
straight and that drill better be good because if 
it's not, that's where you're going to lose it to.

15:33.740 --> 15:38.091
And so it's been a great thing. Of the other bands in 
this region of the country, Which ones do you

15:42.213 --> 15:45.137
respect the most? Well, in the Southwest 
Conference, I feel that I think my second choice is

15:45.898 --> 15:52.207
Texas Tech. I think they have a wonderful band. And 
I think they're... They not only march well, they

16:00.218 --> 16:06.107
play beautifully, and they're usually very 
cordial to us. Texas University has a good band,

16:07.089 --> 16:11.876
and I appreciate them. I've always felt like the 
SMU band was a very true art form band. No one else

16:17.184 --> 16:27.660
did what they did, and no one else did what we did, so 
you could possibly say that we were the only two

16:17.184 --> 16:27.660
originals around. I feel man for man I think they 
probably got more sound I don't think it's so much

16:27.640 --> 16:49.716
that way anymore but man for man they were just 
absolutely blow the end out of those things but

16:27.640 --> 16:49.716
Texas Tech I've always enjoyed them and I think 
next to the Aggie band they would probably be my

16:27.640 --> 16:49.716
favorite and of course otherwise Ohio State is 
probably right up on the list Michigan has a great

16:50.708 --> 17:14.320
band and there's so many real real fine ones but you 
know I really didn't have a whole lot of time to

16:50.708 --> 17:14.320
think about how good anybody else was I never ever 
recall when we're getting set to play somebody

16:50.708 --> 17:14.320
that we ever mentioned who we were playing And I do 
have heard that down at the Texas band, when Mr.

17:14.823 --> 17:27.703
Donino, Dr. Vincent Donino was there, he was a very 
dear friend of mine, said, well, all year long now,

17:14.823 --> 17:27.703
we've just been playing. Now, this week, we've got 
a march. The Aggies are coming. You got to get those

17:30.227 --> 17:32.430
lines straight, and you got to do something. Now, 
he told me this. So, you know, it's just

17:34.032 --> 17:41.143
a matter of taste, I think. Some people 
probably... Now, all members of the band were in

17:42.245 --> 17:46.793
the Corps. Right. Compared to the other Corps 
members, were there more contracts, more DNC in

17:49.057 --> 18:02.520
the band than in the rest of the Corps, or was it just 
about the same? Well, I think it's about the same.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.447
We had a lot of folks that were in the corps just to be 
in the band and they were not interested in in

18:06.747 --> 18:35.758
contracts and were became dnc's but there were a 
lot of them in the other part of the corps the corps

18:06.747 --> 18:35.758
would have a difficult time existing without 
their dnc's but i think the the the band always had

18:06.747 --> 18:35.758
their share of the of the uh of the the uh uh 
contracts and also we had a very extensive program

18:35.738 --> 18:44.509
for improving our grade system, and our grades 
were really very high in the band. I was going to

18:44.529 --> 18:48.154
say, compared to the rest of the Corps, weren't 
band grades higher? They were higher, especially

18:48.274 --> 18:49.876
A Company. They would get the academic, it seemed 
like almost every year, they would get the

18:49.896 --> 19:02.252
academic

18:49.896 --> 19:02.252
flag

18:49.896 --> 19:02.252
when they had the award ceremonies. They would win 
that almost every year. How likely was a freshman

19:05.540 --> 19:13.391
in the band to be able to march at halftime the first 
year? We had a rotation system, and we tried our

19:14.313 --> 19:27.192
best, unless they just did not have problems of 
some kind, that no freshman would miss more than

19:14.313 --> 19:27.192
one game. And we kept up with it every week, and we'd 
have them over on the side, And then we tried to fix

19:34.801 --> 19:36.686
that. Now sometime it was, some of them would have 
to miss more than one, but every week you have

19:36.786 --> 19:48.434
people that are hurt, you have people that are 
sick, and it's necessary to use those alternates

19:36.786 --> 19:48.434
in there. So it was really good to have a large group 
And I didn't care how many we had, I didn't want to

19:53.228 --> 20:03.083
march for 303, because you could not do, with more 
than that, it's very difficult to do anything.

20:03.524 --> 20:04.966
It's just really pretty. 303. That's 300 plus the 
three drum majors, yeah. And that's 25 plus 12, I

20:10.274 --> 20:13.579
believe, if I remember right. That's been a long 
time. But anyway. And in terms of their...

20:19.638 --> 20:33.377
military relation you had both Air Force Army and 
Navy Marines Navy and Marines just like the rest

20:19.638 --> 20:33.377
that's right we had all four about were they 
similar to the Corps in terms of the percentage

20:33.745 --> 20:40.638
that lived on campus compared to the 
percentage... Well, they had to have special

20:33.745 --> 20:40.638
permission to live off campus. It had to be 
extenuating circumstances. Even if they were

20:43.504 --> 20:45.047
juniors and seniors? Even if they were juniors and 
seniors, they had to live. They had to live,

20:47.572 --> 20:50.337
whether they were married They had a hardship 
case, had to live with their grandmother and Brian

20:50.317 --> 20:54.182
or something like that. But they had to live in dorm 
9, dorm 11. That's where we had ours. And so we,

20:59.890 --> 21:06.338
what's so wonderful about that, you can usually 
find them. If you don't, they're not in their room,

21:06.579 --> 21:11.024
just leave a note and tell them to come in and see 
you. And that's, it's one of the most, it's the

21:11.045 --> 21:16.712
finest setup for a van I believe I ever saw. Can you 
describe, please, the process for selecting drum

21:17.063 --> 21:21.568
majors? We have a committee, and you have one from 
each class, plus the present drum majors, plus the

21:22.369 --> 21:44.033
COs, and I was the head of the committee, and we 
would have two days of grueling

21:45.599 --> 22:10.948
things for them to do in other words they would have 
to go inside and direct the national anthem they

21:45.599 --> 22:10.948
would have to direct the spirit each one of them 
then we would have to go outside and they would have

21:45.599 --> 22:10.948
to take them through a drill and have to hear their 
verbal commands and we'll have to see their baton

21:45.599 --> 22:10.948
work and then we would go inside and we would go 
right down the list of just about everything

22:11.367 --> 22:36.970
whether they change their shorts every day or 
their socks or what they knew it and we would

22:11.367 --> 22:36.970
discuss each one about leadership qualities and 
personal qualities and leadership how

22:11.367 --> 22:36.970
meaningful that is to them and whether they're a 
team player or a hot dog or And it's quite grueling,

22:36.950 --> 22:42.635
and I can only think of one time that I had to break 
the tie. And to be honest with you, the band

22:42.655 --> 22:49.802
directors would always pick theirs just like 
anybody else. And sometimes I wouldn't get any of

22:50.442 --> 22:55.567
the top three that they'd pick, and we'd just vote 
on it, see? And we'd talk about it and put them on the

22:55.587 --> 23:01.893
board, and they usually worked out pretty good. 
All three had to be seniors? have to be seniors then

23:04.540 --> 23:28.084
they picked they picked three in an alternate and 
uh one year we had to use an alternate and we had twin

23:04.540 --> 23:28.084
drum majors the twin uh one of the twins made it the 
other one was the alternate and when this guy left

23:04.540 --> 23:28.084
and so we we had we had two you couldn't tell them 
apart and uh And let's see, now I think I've heard

23:28.587 --> 23:34.876
the term band commander. Yes, he's appointed by 
the, we recommend him, I recommend him. But he's

23:41.326 --> 23:42.808
not the drill major. No, no. He's the ROTC. He is the 
band commander and he's the ROTC. He's appointed

23:46.995 --> 23:48.837
by the commandant. And they do let me recommend 
him, and then he's appointed by the commandant. In

23:53.685 --> 23:56.569
terms of prestige... there was keener 
competition for which? To be band commander?

24:00.869 --> 24:23.296
Well, the band commander is supposedly the 
highest, he's the highest officer in there, but

24:00.869 --> 24:23.296
prestige-wise, in my opinion, the drum major's 
got, they got all the glory, and he got all the work,

24:00.869 --> 24:23.296
because they were out there in front, and the head 
drum major, of course, was the one that does the

24:00.869 --> 24:23.296
recall step-off on hullabaloo, and they liked to 
make a big deal out of that. One guy cracked a

24:23.316 --> 24:26.961
vertebra in his neck one day shaking his head for 
the We call him Mooney's, and he cracked a burger

24:27.211 --> 24:31.015
right back there. Had to wear a little old brace, 
one of the head gun major. I said, well, see there,

24:34.418 --> 24:37.842
if you just go ahead and say it quicker than that, it 
wouldn't happen to you. When you arrived, let's

24:38.583 --> 24:41.546
talk about the personnel. When you arrived, were 
there any minority members of the band, Hispanic?

24:48.272 --> 24:51.936
Yes, we had several of those.

24:54.008 --> 25:04.848
We had several Hispanics and several, we had some 
people from New York and we didn't have any black

24:54.008 --> 25:04.848
folks. Didn't have any black folks? No, no. Any 
international band members? We had some from

25:09.217 --> 25:11.842
Panama. Really? And we would get several of those 
every year from some country. I had one from

25:17.423 --> 25:21.909
Iroquois maybe? Do you remember, you said there 
was no black member of the band when you came? No.

25:29.159 --> 25:32.503
But after that we had- When do you remember? Can you 
describe how that worked? Well, we had probably,

25:36.089 --> 25:48.209
you know, every year we took some if they signed up, 
but I don't remember when we had the first one. Do

25:48.229 --> 25:53.097
you remember any difficulties, any incidents at 
all? No. Oh, no. No, we never had any. One of them,

25:56.142 --> 26:02.475
the last year I was there we had a black drum major. 
And he was killed about two weeks ago, or about two

26:04.038 --> 26:11.333
months ago, a month ago, in a plane crash. He had 
applied for a commission and I wrote several

26:11.313 --> 26:29.946
letters from him and he got the commission but then 
they wouldn't let him fly because of some kind of

26:11.313 --> 26:29.946
eye problem or something and then he was flying for 
the Civil Air Patrol and his plane crashed. See, I

26:30.415 --> 26:37.263
believe that this school's record on black-white 
relations has always been splendid. Oh, I think

26:37.283 --> 26:38.184
it's wonderful. We never had a menish problem. I 
tell people, as an observer, that I have the

26:40.446 --> 26:50.698
impression the key thing was not who your parents 
were, but are you an Aggie or you're not an Aggie?

26:50.718 --> 26:50.938
Absolutely. It doesn't make any difference about 
that other. Not to me, it doesn't. All right, now

26:54.021 --> 26:59.207
let's go to the admission of women in the band. When 
did anybody first contact you about? Well do you

27:04.375 --> 27:06.798
remember the Zentgraft deal? Yes I do. Do you 
remember the Zentgraft? Originally she was

27:09.382 --> 27:21.239
challenging the Color Guard and she was 
challenging the Ross Volunteers as the

27:09.382 --> 27:21.239
organization. She was not in the band. So she just 
threw in the ban as an afterthought. And then she

27:26.688 --> 27:30.735
entered that into her deal because we didn't have 
any. So did she ever come to talk to you about doing

27:31.456 --> 27:35.282
the ban? No, she never even been in the ban hall. I 
wonder if she even was a... She was upset because

27:39.249 --> 27:45.279
they wouldn't take her in the color guard, I 
believe. And so anyway, then when they went to the

27:45.299 --> 27:49.326
judge, And we were interviewed by, I could see the 
writing on the wall, just to be perfectly honest

27:49.627 --> 27:55.364
with you. And I told them the first day, I said, hey, 
we're not gonna win this. Why don't we just go ahead

27:59.737 --> 28:01.442
and do it? And let us have the $200,000 you're going 
to spend on this thing, and we'll buy something we

28:01.844 --> 28:08.711
really need with it. Oh, no, no, no, we've got to 
fight. Well, anyway, this went on for five years.

28:13.496 --> 28:28.172
And people would, and I said, hey, look, do you 
think for a minute now in Washington, D.C., they

28:13.496 --> 28:28.172
can say, they have such a good band, let's just 
leave it all male because they'll be the only one

28:13.496 --> 28:28.172
then that doesn't have it. It's not going to work 
that way. And then I didn't say anymore. But

28:32.538 --> 28:36.884
anyway, it was quite hush-hush, and I was not 
allowed to talk about it. And I said, if you'll just

28:37.945 --> 28:43.433
let us do it, we'll do it in no time. But we had a press 
conference over there. There was a

28:46.117 --> 28:54.769
representative from every major radio station 
and TV station in the country, and we took five of

28:46.117 --> 28:54.769
them in. And... And what year was that? I'm not real 
sure. I think it was Haskell, I'm not real sure. It

29:06.103 --> 29:07.744
may be in that book over there. It was in the 80s. I 
think it was in the 85 or 80s, somewhere along in

29:09.406 --> 29:13.670
there. And the first one that came in there was a 
girl about 6'2", and she was an all-state trombone

29:14.430 --> 29:30.165
player, and she was an athlete, very nice looking. 
And she still writes me. And she was the first one,

29:33.728 --> 29:38.172
she was the only one there, she was the first one to 
graduate. Now, within the typical band member,

29:39.573 --> 29:45.039
how did they react? They were all going to quit. And 
this presented a problem. And they came in and

29:51.164 --> 29:53.567
said, we're not going to stay, we're going to quit. 
I said, now, wait a minute. So I talked to John,

29:54.848 --> 29:57.470
Johnny and I talked about it a lot. John Colas. John 
Colas. And I said, Johnny, I want to find out one

29:59.312 --> 30:03.516
thing from you right quick before we go on here now. 
If they all quit like they say they are, which I

30:04.171 --> 30:10.001
think we can handle that, are we still going to have 
a ban? He said, we will have a ban if they quit. So I go

30:12.725 --> 30:17.813
back to him and I say, now, gentlemen, I want to tell 
you something. If you all quit, and boy, I mean they

30:17.833 --> 30:21.299
were 100%. If you quit like you say they are, then 
the Aggie ban is through. It's done. It's

30:29.732 --> 30:31.433
finished. Now, if you want to continue to have the 
Aggie Band with a few exceptions, you'll stay. But

30:41.324 --> 30:51.795
I have talked to the Vice President of Student 
Services, and he very confidently told me that

30:41.324 --> 30:51.795
they will have a band here whether you quit or not. 
Now, I'm asking you not to quit. Don't let four or

30:58.800 --> 31:03.726
five women ruin this organization. Said girls 
have been, said, I don't want girls in this band,

31:04.567 --> 31:11.256
but I love girls. I've been married to one for 42 
years. And they are not going to hurt us like you

31:14.300 --> 31:19.707
think they will. Well, they didn't say anything. 
Just looked and stared, glassy. So they came back,

31:24.606 --> 31:25.908
C.O. came back and said, sir, we're going to try it. 
I said, that's fine, because they're going to have

31:29.192 --> 31:37.965
a band, and I'm going to stay here, and I can go 
somewhere else or whatever, but I'm going to stay.

31:37.945 --> 31:40.553
And I think we ought to stay and do it. And they will 
wear the same things that you wear. They will have

31:45.087 --> 31:46.391
their hair. That was the main thing they were 
concerned about. They wanted them to look.
