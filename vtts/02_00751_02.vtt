WEBVTT

00:01.313 --> 00:04.278
a hard time getting jobs for the students. Was the 
faculty then fairly well fixed? The faculty

00:07.644 --> 00:09.267
didn't move around much. I think this is what I 
don't think we see. I think I'd have to look in the

00:13.554 --> 00:27.017
book to check our registration and student 
numbers against dates, but I don't think the if

00:27.588 --> 00:31.112
they couldn't work out and couldn't get jobs, 
they'd go to school. I don't think the depression,

00:31.753 --> 00:43.886
and this is just my opinion now without looking at 
numbers, that I don't think the depression

00:31.753 --> 00:43.886
affected the registration at school. Do you know 
anything about that? I know that they hired a

00:45.828 --> 00:53.216
number of students to work for small wages and have 
a number of remembrances of them. Did you hire any

00:53.236 --> 00:55.198
in your department to work for? worked for y'all. I 
know agriculture hired him. Well, we used to have

01:00.124 --> 01:02.928
student labor and that type of thing. To help out 
students who needed the money to go to school.

01:06.373 --> 01:07.514
Yeah, we had that. But I don't remember details 
about the actual 25 cents. I mean, how much they

01:15.285 --> 01:16.987
paid. I don't remember that. Let's jump up a little 
ahead to the war years here in Indiana. Were you

01:24.617 --> 01:26.620
here during the entire war years? I can remember

01:28.439 --> 01:55.662
I had a one o'clock class

01:28.439 --> 01:55.662
and I can remember and that particular class it was 
a seminar class where the boys would get up and give

01:28.439 --> 01:55.662
a technical talk two things make them get more used 
to looking stuff up in the literature, magazines,

01:56.013 --> 02:02.624
journals, and also getting up and presenting a 
technical talk.

02:05.248 --> 02:14.022
And I can remember, and this was a one o'clock 
class, when I walked in that class that day,

02:15.537 --> 02:23.245
So usually there was a lot of talk going on and 
kidding back and forth, getting ready for before

02:15.537 --> 02:23.245
class. And everything was so solemn and the like. 
And because these boys knew that they were going to

02:28.871 --> 02:35.858
be taken out before they had finished and the like. 
And it was a solemn class.

02:43.425 --> 02:44.987
They were taken out quite a bit early. Mm-hmm. 
Things must have slowed down a great deal during

02:46.858 --> 02:49.742
the war. Yeah, that's right. I think that's right. 
Then, of course, well, in certain areas it

02:53.567 --> 03:06.304
blossomed because they brought in a lot of Army and 
Navy for special training classes and the like.

03:06.324 --> 03:07.466
Did you handle any of those? No, I didn't. One of the 
things that I was quite active in was...

03:17.671 --> 03:30.051
because so many of the men in industry, technical 
men in industry, were drafted out, or the

03:17.671 --> 03:30.051
industrial companies were handicapped. And they 
started what they called engineering, science,

03:31.393 --> 03:37.843
management, or training. In other words, the 
first job was to recruit teachers.

03:45.785 --> 03:49.569
And mine was in chemical engineering. And then 
recruit the industries

03:51.171 --> 04:12.214
to put on classes so that they could have classes to 
upgrade some of their lower class men so that they

03:51.171 --> 04:12.214
could replace the men who had been drafted out at 
higher levels. And we taught a lot of those kind of

04:13.004 --> 04:17.290
things and engineers. Were these short courses or 
full term courses? No, they were usually about two

04:20.414 --> 04:25.140
months instead of three or four. So these were 
really special students? Oh yes, oh these were all

04:27.083 --> 04:29.065
special. A course on heat transfer, a course on 
what they were. So you really lost most of your four

04:35.114 --> 04:38.738
year students at that time. Right, this is right. 
Stayed on for two years. I see. Did you lose any...

04:45.564 --> 04:51.433
This is why I'd be interested in checking dates 
with registration in the school. Did you lose any

04:52.394 --> 04:57.742
of your staff because of the lighter load of 
students? As I remember it, we did not. I don't

04:59.905 --> 05:00.806
think we did. Some of them, I think, went and... 
Then most of your work during the 40s was during the

05:09.586 --> 05:15.471
war years was fairly well geared to the war itself 
and to the various facets of government programs.

05:15.632 --> 05:18.574
Any others that stick out in your mind? Anything 
that might be of interest to you? Possibly a little

05:20.977 --> 05:22.038
known? Any work you might have done here? Programs 
directed? No,

05:27.663 --> 05:37.652
I don't

05:27.663 --> 05:37.652
recall too much.

05:42.847 --> 05:48.215
See, this was quite a few years ago, some of these 
questions. Yes, I understand. There's another.

05:55.966 --> 06:08.044
You spoke, when we spoke together, about somebody 
I might suggest

05:55.966 --> 06:08.044
is...

06:09.863 --> 06:11.905
There's a man here by the name of M.K. Thornton. His 
nickname is Duke, Duke Thornton,

06:12.386 --> 06:28.944
T-H-O-R-N-T-O-N.

06:12.386 --> 06:28.944
And he was one of the older time teachers, kind of a 
descriptive type when they were teaching

06:12.386 --> 06:28.944
chemical engineering from the descriptive 
courses. And

06:30.866 --> 06:35.592
Don Harris, W.D. Harris came here. He just retired 
now. And he's an Iowa State PhD man. And he came here

06:43.707 --> 06:46.311
about 1935. I came in 38. And he probably, he knows a 
lot about the early, if you're trying to get early

06:48.253 --> 06:57.925
history and the like. And Thornton, Duke 
Thornton, would know the real, if you really, he

06:58.947 --> 07:08.559
knows some of these very early presidents. And he 
was telling me, There's a men's garden club, and it

07:10.681 --> 07:15.808
meets once a month. And I'm not a gardener, but a lot 
of my good friends go to it, so I go to this men's

07:17.009 --> 07:29.145
garden club mainly for the association rather 
than for any way. And I used to take Duke to this

07:29.185 --> 07:34.933
men's garden club. He's quite a talker, and he'd 
get talking some of these old presidents' way and

07:35.690 --> 07:42.279
the like. He can, I think, give you a lot of early 
history. Let me digress just a little bit here.

07:52.033 --> 07:54.196
Drop back to when you first came here in 1938. Could 
you give me some first impressions, what you

07:54.657 --> 07:58.062
thought about the school?

08:00.605 --> 08:04.110
Was it just a sleepy little cow college? 
Basically, it was a country boys' school. One of

08:07.621 --> 08:23.715
the things that stands out in my

08:07.621 --> 08:23.715
mind was that so many of the boys were first 
generation of college students. In other words,

08:23.915 --> 08:33.304
that's what kind of a boy I was when I was going to 
school. And yet up north, a lot of these boy parents

08:33.487 --> 08:39.514
had been to college. And when I came down here, why, 
these boys, their parents were farm workers or

08:40.816 --> 08:57.536
workers and had not been to

08:40.816 --> 08:57.536
college, educated, higher education. Many of 
them had probably never been to high school.

08:59.158 --> 08:59.499
Right. And so that was one thing that I enjoyed 
working. with these students who were first

09:03.440 --> 09:12.470
generation of college students, so anxious to 
learn, anxious to learn, and do a good job in

09:03.440 --> 09:12.470
school. So you were very favorably impressed with 
the students? Oh, I certainly was. I certainly

09:15.653 --> 09:16.854
was. And I think it's, I've enjoyed, I have enjoyed 
my work here very much.

09:31.722 --> 09:39.932
Could you recall some of the people that you were 
most closely associated with or that you recall

09:31.722 --> 09:39.932
most favorably, people that made an impression on 
you? Well, we were in this combined chemistry and

09:40.293 --> 09:48.803
chemical engineering under Dr. Hedges. It was

09:50.886 --> 09:57.093
an old-timer F.F. Bishop. He'd been here. I think 
came about 1924 or something of that nature,

10:01.287 --> 10:07.716
whereas I didn't come until 38. Dr. Harris didn't 
come until 35. And

10:11.942 --> 10:18.851
Old Bish was just a fine chap. He died maybe 10 years 
ago, 15 years ago. I don't know. I should have these

10:23.157 --> 10:25.079
dates in mind. But he was just, he came from upper 
New York State, had gone to a small town in upper New

10:29.620 --> 10:33.425
York State. He was a northern boy, but he'd come 
down here in 24 and had been here for a good many

10:33.485 --> 10:40.996
years before I ever landed here. And he had some 
stories that it would really be nice to... They

10:49.527 --> 10:56.316
used to have a trolley line between Bryan and 
College Station, and an actual trolley ran back.

10:56.396 --> 10:57.518
And you'd see most of the... Originally, most of 
the people would live on the campus. They had

11:01.963 --> 11:04.546
campus houses where the professors lived. And 
there's one right in back of where I live. They

11:06.668 --> 11:08.709
moved many of those around College Station. 
Right. There's one man that bought ours, bought

11:09.310 --> 11:13.193
that one. He used to be head of the publicity around 
here years ago. And he bought it, and then he moved

11:18.458 --> 11:27.066
away and sold it to a Baptist minister, I believe. 
And so there are a good many of those old campus

11:27.772 --> 11:30.656
houses.

11:33.439 --> 11:38.185
There were many of them where Spence Park is now, 
over beside the corn dorms there. There was a whole

11:38.205 --> 11:39.507
row there. Well, then, so old Bishop, I remember, 
he used to like that. He was not married. He was a

11:48.319 --> 11:50.561
bachelor for many, many years. And then 
eventually he did break down and get married. He

11:55.497 --> 11:58.300
used to like to eat well and drink beer. Not just 
drink beer. He very seldom would drink any

12:00.822 --> 12:05.346
whiskey, but Old Fish was fine. He had a stroke here 
several years ago. And what was his position? He

12:11.271 --> 12:14.354
taught chemical engineering. And so the three of 
us made up that new department of chemical

12:15.655 --> 12:24.323
engineering. Professor Harris, me, and F.F. 
Bishop. Do you have any interesting

12:30.681 --> 12:39.633
recollection,

12:30.681 --> 12:39.633
any interesting remembrance of Gib Gilchrist?

12:42.396 --> 12:50.768
Well,

12:42.396 --> 12:50.768
he was a strict disciplinarian, and I believe in 
that. I think he was a very strict disciplinarian.

13:03.859 --> 13:07.263
Well, I think I liked Mr. Gilchrist. Of course, 
he's the one that hired me, really. Got me started

13:09.827 --> 13:25.427
in this, so he

13:09.827 --> 13:25.427
helped get the college station started as a 
community.

13:27.128 --> 13:34.835
That's where it got its name, Station on the 
Railroad, where I lived off to.

13:34.855 --> 13:44.504
In your long tenure here, have you any thoughts on 
the involvement of the Corps of Cadets since you

13:34.855 --> 13:44.504
came here? Seen any changes in it? Well, it used to 
be mandatory, and everybody that came here had to

13:48.788 --> 13:56.595
take it. But I thought it was a fine... The students 
we got that way were very fine students. It taught

14:06.897 --> 14:15.990
them discipline, taught them to do a job whether 
they wanted to or not, if they were asked to do it,

14:06.897 --> 14:15.990
whether they did it. And

14:16.010 --> 14:21.438
their attitude, yes, sir. I thought that was very 
good. Very fine training. Did you see any changes

14:28.568 --> 14:35.354
over the years in the Corps that you thought were 
good or bad? Well,

14:35.374 --> 14:48.247
the first step was to let the boys go to school 
without necessarily taking Corps activities.

14:50.089 --> 14:56.535
And the students

14:50.089 --> 14:56.535
did not like that, as far as I was concerned. It 
worked out. It was done gradually enough so that I

14:57.679 --> 15:05.447
saw no real

14:57.679 --> 15:05.447
detriment. That didn't really happen, though, 
until after World War II, right? I guess so. So many

15:10.211 --> 15:11.473
civilian students.

15:14.496 --> 15:18.440
They taught quite all kinds of classes during the 
war. Code classes and electrical classes. kind of

15:24.713 --> 15:27.356
trade school type of thing.

15:33.504 --> 15:36.508
What were some of the more outstanding problems or 
situations? Mr. Gilchrist? I don't think he can

15:37.809 --> 15:38.971
put this. You want me to turn this in? No, it's 
nothing. But I mean,

15:42.395 --> 15:50.905
he was very embarrassed when it happened. They 
were having some kind of a formal formal dinner and

15:54.278 --> 15:59.886
they served fried chicken or something like that. 
And I know the lady that was sitting next to him, she

15:59.906 --> 16:06.334
was one of our good friends.

16:09.939 --> 16:22.276
And one of them almost killed Chris, big chicken 
leg flew off the plate and went right in the middle

16:09.939 --> 16:22.276
of her lap and was he embarrassed.

16:22.296 --> 16:23.998
Do you think he had a sense of humor? Oh, I think he 
had a good sense of humor. I might think of some of

16:29.514 --> 16:35.140
those

16:29.514 --> 16:35.140
things. Were there any outstanding problems or 
situations that confronted you during your

16:35.160 --> 16:43.028
association with the college? You've mentioned, 
one, the formation of the chemical engineering

16:43.048 --> 16:48.394
department. Do you think of any major problems 
that had to be overcome? situations which you

16:53.054 --> 16:56.658
encountered in your history here. Well, it was 
this drinking problem with the... Yes, you

17:00.922 --> 17:02.003
mentioned that. Drinking problem. Taking empty 
bottles home in their suitcases. Let's solve

17:08.869 --> 17:09.810
that.

17:19.860 --> 17:22.723
You mentioned you had problems with space Well, 
when

17:24.222 --> 17:47.631
we were

17:24.222 --> 17:47.631
transferred out of the chemistry department,

17:50.260 --> 17:55.828
Well, chemical engineering was just, teaching of 
chemical engineering was just changing as I came

17:50.260 --> 17:55.828
here. And the laboratory work was just changing. 
And they had just bought a bunch of equipment to

18:00.374 --> 18:11.129
teach the new type of chemical engineering 
teaching. And we had just gotten it all installed

18:12.811 --> 18:16.977
over here in the old chemistry building.

18:20.163 --> 18:28.856
Then about just after we got it installed, while we 
got moved over to the, of course, we were happy

18:20.163 --> 18:28.856
about getting moved out. But then we had to 
reinstall it all over again. So it was, but we used

18:34.765 --> 18:38.390
student labor for that. We used a lot of student 
labor, and that was good for them. Then we got into,

18:42.516 --> 18:49.967
we could cut a hole in the floor if we wanted the 
column to go up three stories. We could cut a hole in

18:50.386 --> 18:53.850
the floor and we got in no trouble at all. Just cut a 
hole in the floor. Whereas in this brand new

18:55.992 --> 19:00.337
building we got, I don't think they'd like us 
cutting. No, I don't think they'd appreciate that

19:00.357 --> 19:02.219
at all.

19:05.363 --> 19:11.290
Do you feel that you had any important 
accomplishments while you were here at A&M? Do you

19:11.310 --> 19:15.094
think you'd like to look back on any pride or 
viewing accomplishments? Well, I think the

19:16.660 --> 19:22.769
feeling was good working with the students, a very 
good association with the students. This is what I

19:22.789 --> 19:26.534
appreciate and I like. Accomplishments I think 
was, I was not a big researcher, but I hired some

19:26.554 --> 19:36.509
people who were. And I think one of the

19:36.549 --> 19:46.363
men that took my place when I retired. He's done 
very, very well here. And the way he came here, I

19:54.535 --> 20:16.266
was teaching at North Carolina State before I came 
here, and I had a senior in there who stayed on

19:54.535 --> 20:16.266
teaching at North Carolina State. And we got along 
well.

20:24.085 --> 20:42.388
And so he had a boy come through that had been in the 
Navy and came back to talk to his teacher, which was

20:24.085 --> 20:42.388
one of my students, about graduate work. It would 
be good to take graduate work. Why don't you get out

20:45.636 --> 20:47.399
to Texas A&M? Lindsey used to teach here, and he'll 
give you a good deal. So Charlie Holland, Charles

20:51.686 --> 20:57.274
Holland, came down here with that 
recommendation. And he's done real well.

21:05.065 --> 21:12.797
He's developed a mathematical research and the 
like and done fine.

21:14.448 --> 21:31.605
When

21:14.448 --> 21:31.605
it came my time to retire,

21:14.448 --> 21:31.605
I went in to see Dean Benson and told him he'd have to 
start looking around because I had to retire. And

21:33.307 --> 21:35.349
he said, well, who would you recommend? And so I 
told him, and I thought, Dr. Holland, if he

21:37.571 --> 21:43.577
searched the country over, you would not find any 
better man to take my place. So he hired him, and I

21:48.413 --> 21:51.616
think he's done real well.

21:55.140 --> 22:02.267
And Professor Harris has done quite well in 
research on cottonseed oil and the like. He has

22:04.330 --> 22:09.295
gotten a new idea recently,

22:11.063 --> 22:15.667
using hydrogen as a fuel for automobiles instead 
of gasoline. That's received some publicity. And

22:18.570 --> 22:22.854
I think there's just been a recent article come out 
of MIT on the same basis. Sort of a fuel cell type

22:23.354 --> 22:28.920
thing?

22:28.940 --> 22:33.204
I think, no, just a combustion of hydrogen. Rather 
than production of electricity. Yeah, yeah, no.

22:42.772 --> 22:44.273
Then we had a man here. We hired a man. Mr. Gilchrist 
wanted to get started. And he hired a man by the name

22:54.604 --> 22:57.186
of Kirkbride, C.G. Kirkbride, as a research 
professor, distinguished research professor.

23:03.513 --> 23:11.901
And Kirkbride was working for an American oil 
company down in Texas City.

23:14.378 --> 23:18.483
And he came in here, but he was a promoter.

23:21.086 --> 23:26.753
And he used this job as a stepping stone to go to work 
for Sun Oil Company. And he really did well. He got

23:30.317 --> 23:33.261
himself on their board of directors and all of 
that. He was with Sun Oil, so he really did a lot.

23:37.646 --> 23:38.867
We've kept in touch with him. He promoted himself. 
He stayed here only about two years, almost. And

23:44.922 --> 23:54.533
yeah, he did, but we still keep in touch with him. 
Then they hired another man to take his place by the

23:54.553 --> 24:03.484
name of Murdock, M-U-R-D-O-C-H, who was really a 
theoretical boy. He could lay on the mathematics

24:03.964 --> 24:10.812
and the like real high.

24:12.243 --> 24:17.850
He eventually went to work for Dow Chemical 
Company and got moved down here in Texas City.

24:21.554 --> 24:23.636
Freeport, Freeport instead of Texas City. And 
then he got moved up to the Midland, big research

24:24.918 --> 24:32.086
there, Midland, Michigan. There was a large 
research group and has done well.

24:37.913 --> 24:41.237
So a lot of our people, some of those people have 
used us as stepping stones.

24:51.577 --> 25:00.074
But Don Harris, Professor Harris, he's an Iowa 
State man, he stayed here, came here before I did.

25:02.518 --> 25:04.322
Then we had a man that came here and got interested 
in cottonseed vegetable oils by the name of Bill

25:06.850 --> 25:17.941
Harris, W.B. Harris. And he's on the staff now. He 
came up through the cottonseed research, oilseed

25:22.586 --> 25:30.714
research group. And he's started some very 
interesting things in the department. on stack

25:37.192 --> 25:44.982
sampling and that pollution and the like. And he's 
had a group of people in from industry and have had

25:45.002 --> 25:52.811
short courses of people. I think I attended to a 
couple of them. Just some of my old students came in

25:56.376 --> 26:00.601
and the like. Yeah, one of my students for lots of 
time, well, just

26:08.427 --> 26:09.248
about a week ago.

26:12.333 --> 26:18.722
One former student and his wife and daughter is 
coming. His daughter is going to register here.

26:20.865 --> 26:22.427
And they just stopped over to see us. And he was 
making arrangements for her to get in the

26:22.507 --> 26:27.554
dormitory and that type of thing. And so they just 
stopped over to see me. What makes me feel a little

26:30.499 --> 26:37.168
bit, a little before that, one of the former 
students was in. started telling me about his

26:37.840 --> 26:41.623
granddaughter had just been born. So when my 
students start telling me about their

26:41.643 --> 26:46.687
grandchildren, it makes me wonder. This was what 
you would consider then as your greatest success

26:48.109 --> 26:54.174
and accomplishment are your statements. Right, 
that's right, that's right. Well, I should have

26:56.296 --> 27:07.425
brought something over, but one of our students 
had been on the board of directors of Mobile Well

26:56.296 --> 27:07.425
Company, done fine. This picture was in their 
annual report and the like. Those are the things

27:13.899 --> 27:16.883
that make you feel good. That will give you a real 
sense of accomplishment, I'm sure. Well, we've

27:19.707 --> 27:20.668
got them all. We've got a lot of vice presidents. 
Selenese Corporation is a very good company. One

27:28.677 --> 27:30.660
of our boys is vice president of that. These kind of 
things is what, of course, We've got all kinds of

27:35.688 --> 27:49.893
boys, and one of the things that makes me feel good 
is some of the boys that had a heck of a hard time to

27:35.688 --> 27:49.893
get through have done very well after they get out. 
And I think it was because they were used to

27:49.913 --> 27:55.283
working.

27:56.512 --> 28:02.358
They had to work hard to get through, and they kept 
that working hard themselves after they got out.

28:02.518 --> 28:08.585
Whereas some of these boys that had it easy to get 
through, they could coast, and so they coasted

28:02.518 --> 28:08.585
after they got out. And these boys that had to work 
hard would go ahead of them.

28:16.754 --> 28:26.164
And then what made me feel good,

28:16.754 --> 28:26.164
before we started graduate work here, why I would 
encourage our boys to go to graduate school. And we

28:33.669 --> 28:35.431
had a... I got one up in Princeton, and he really did 
well. And I'd see, I'd meet these people from this

28:40.998 --> 28:48.507
ASAS, Society of Engineering Education. I got to 
know people all over the country through that

28:48.527 --> 28:53.172
organization. And I got to know this... head of the 
department at Princeton real well. And he said, if

29:00.163 --> 29:10.197
you have any more boys like him, all you have to do is 
just tell him, I can recommend them. And he'd get

29:10.217 --> 29:11.058
them in. And we did that for three or four boys. And 
he told me they'd put some, we'd had so many A&M boys

29:15.844 --> 29:26.138
up there, they'd put Texas A&M Research 
Laboratory.

29:26.945 --> 29:33.755
And we had a fine relationship with Wisconsin, 
Michigan, Princeton. So having that kind of a role

29:34.517 --> 29:43.090
was satisfying that one of our boys went from up to 
Wisconsin. Now he's head of the research for the

29:44.131 --> 29:47.016
Standard Oil in New Jersey. Or maybe not the head, 
but one of the higher ups in their research

29:47.537 --> 29:52.003
organization. Mathis, M-A-T-H-I-S.

29:56.982 --> 30:10.474
Oh, you know, Vice President of Shell, I don't 
think of his name, but he was down in one of their

29:56.982 --> 30:10.474
islands where they have a very large research, 
large operating refinery and the like. You might,

30:11.075 --> 30:20.824
if you have some time, jot down a list of your 
distinguished students and those that have

30:11.075 --> 30:20.824
changed some continents. We have an interest in 
people who have done this. Manager of... There's a

30:28.471 --> 30:37.945
big caustic soda plant, chlorine caustic soda, by 
mining salt, passing electricity through it. You

30:38.586 --> 30:43.814
generate chlorine and make sodium hydroxide 
caustic soda. And one of our boys had manned a big

30:44.275 --> 30:52.928
plant and those kind of things and all that. Let's 
shift gears just a moment here and ask you what you

30:52.948 --> 30:57.955
might regard as some of the greater weaknesses or 
failures or possibly lost opportunities or

30:58.812 --> 31:05.418
misdirections of the university during your 
association? Just a little bit critical if you

31:06.299 --> 31:07.940
can. Think of anything that might have been better 
had it not occurred or some changes. Well, I think

31:13.786 --> 31:17.970
some of these changes have been made. Getting a 
little more cultural material in our courses.

31:27.432 --> 31:45.509
I think certainly you need to know a lot of

31:27.432 --> 31:45.509
mathematics and science and the like, but I think 
they put in a little bit more education in English

31:27.432 --> 31:45.509
and that type of thing, which I think is good. I 
think that's very important. Yeah, I think so too.

31:48.452 --> 31:57.000
I used to encourage students to...

31:58.364 --> 31:59.285
take more of that. In other words, one complained 
to me how the English department used to make them

31:59.485 --> 32:06.414
write. He didn't like that. And so the way I 
counteracted that was, the only way your boss up on

32:09.398 --> 32:24.577
top above your immediate superior, but two or 
three, four notches up, is reports which you write

32:09.398 --> 32:24.577
and get sent upstairs. And if you don't know how to 
write a good report, Why, the better you can make a

32:28.368 --> 32:36.637
report that's going upstairs, the better off 
you'll be considered by those that have something

32:28.368 --> 32:36.637
to say. So I was encouraging people to not look down 
on English

32:38.078 --> 32:48.950
as a tool, really. In other words, the more liberal 
arts that an engineer could take, the more

32:49.650 --> 32:54.295
well-rounded an engineer could become. That's 
right. That's exactly right. I think there's a

32:56.937 --> 33:00.882
trend by many people today to try to take the 
liberal arts out. I've heard some engineering

33:02.003 --> 33:09.752
people who would like to get more pure engineering 
in and reduce the number of liberal arts courses.

33:11.294 --> 33:14.939
Well, I think that's very interesting. What do you 
regard as some of the more outstanding changes

33:14.959 --> 33:20.265
that have occurred at A&M during your 
association?

33:23.369 --> 33:26.252
Well, I think all of this. Getting in, well, it's 
far enough past now, I think, is letting students

33:26.907 --> 33:40.523
in, civilian students. I think this is a good idea. 
And letting the girls in, I think, is a good idea. It

33:47.952 --> 33:52.017
seems like our tremendous growth has occurred 
after we began to let girls in. Well, again, I think

33:53.779 --> 33:55.581
there's a limit on growth, too. Yes. I think 
there's a limit on growth, too, but the same. Well,

34:03.036 --> 34:11.929
I think broadening the school from a strictly 
military school, I think, was a good idea. I think

34:12.530 --> 34:15.214
then we are becoming a university. Right. That's 
right. I have one personal question. Well, not

34:20.542 --> 34:21.603
really personal. On some research I was doing, did 
you ever know a man by the name of G.S. Fraps? Fraps?

34:27.384 --> 34:29.408
Oh, you mean the old-timer? Yeah. Did you know? He 
used to live right down the street from me. He was a

34:32.532 --> 34:36.859
state chemist, and then he went on to TVA, I 
believe. Not Asbury. I'm talking about Fraps.

34:39.443 --> 34:40.886
Asbury's later. Fraps. Fraps was an old-timer. He 
was a character. I knew him personally. You did?

34:51.723 --> 34:52.364
Oh, yeah. But some of the stories that they used to 
tell about him He wrote prolifically. I have

34:58.454 --> 35:00.816
stacks and stacks of things. He did a lot of work for 
the experiment station. He did most of their

35:04.019 --> 35:06.461
fertilizer analysis. Many of their feed 
analysis. And I was simply wondering about him. We

35:11.485 --> 35:24.917
were doing a bibliography on the experiment 
station, and I kept running across this man,

35:11.485 --> 35:24.917
Fraps, who'd been here for, seemed like he put 
first articles in the 1890s and by the late 1830s, I

35:11.485 --> 35:24.917
mean 1930, he's still writing. And I just wondered 
what kind of man he was. Well, he was a very

35:28.623 --> 35:34.292
penny pincher. He was frugal. Very frugal. He used 
to give out. He ran that office just like Hedges

35:43.266 --> 35:47.894
used to run his operation.

35:50.378 --> 35:52.221
They had to come and ask him for a pencil. And then 
they'll say to whittle their pencil down to that

35:52.977 --> 35:56.442
long white. You wouldn't give them a knowing. This 
is a story I've heard. I didn't work there, but they

36:01.309 --> 36:11.703
say he was a very, there are some old stories about 
old Frapps, which would be very good to... I think

36:14.347 --> 36:16.870
he was something of a campus character then. Yeah, 
he was. Then evidently one of his replacements...

36:20.737 --> 36:24.322
Sam Asbury also became something of a campus 
character, too. Well, I was just curious about

36:26.606 --> 36:28.549
that. That was something I hadn't run across, and I 
hadn't run across any files on it. You might want to

36:34.117 --> 36:37.061
talk to this fellow, Duke Thornton. He's an 
old-timer around here. Okay, I'll do that. Then

36:40.747 --> 36:49.039
there's another man you may wish to talk to, 
although I don't know how... His name is Snuggs.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.511
S-N-U-G-G-S, I guess. I think he lives up on 
Harrington. But he has, his memory failed him, and

36:57.097 --> 37:17.440
you may, I think it'd be good to talk to him and see 
what you can get out of him, but I've heard that his

36:57.097 --> 37:17.440
memory has failed some, but it doesn't every, I'm,

36:57.097 --> 37:17.440
I know that I have a harder time to bring things up 
out of the past. One man says, well, it goes in one

37:21.570 --> 37:24.573
ear and out the other. Well, maybe really that 
happens because there's nothing in between to

37:25.634 --> 37:29.337
stop it. Let me turn this off. OK, you were. OK, I'm 
going to tell you how I got into politics.

37:40.586 --> 37:47.612
There used to be part of the state constitution 
that said, that you could not draw state pay and

37:48.436 --> 37:57.649
still hold a position of honor and trust outside of 
your job.

38:00.352 --> 38:10.146
And

38:00.352 --> 38:10.146
the city of College Station was incorporated. 
Some was, I don't know, about 38 or 40, something in

38:10.206 --> 38:16.975
that region, about 40, say. And we had no trouble of 
having our city council elected from the staff.

38:26.979 --> 38:28.301
There was no trouble at all. And then the city did 
not put a street, or they did put a street, where

38:30.063 --> 38:38.455
some individual did not want that street or wanted 
the street and didn't get it. And he got mad at the

38:41.099 --> 38:47.248
city council, and he found this statement in the 
Constitution. And he brought suit against the

38:48.140 --> 39:02.400
college for paying the state pay because these 
people held a position of honor and trust as a city

38:48.140 --> 39:02.400
council member. Who brought suit? Do you remember 
his name? Well, I'll probably think of it and

39:06.265 --> 39:08.609
just... I hope before I leave. And

39:10.611 --> 39:17.421
so as soon as... this suit was legally brought, the 
college stopped paying these people who were on

39:18.059 --> 39:27.032
the city council. And one of my good friends was in 
that position, and he came to me and asked me if I

39:28.254 --> 39:39.490
would run in his place so he could get his money from 
the college. And so I agreed to do that, and I

39:41.473 --> 39:44.277
happened to win. Who was this that came to you?

39:51.472 --> 39:54.317
I'll get all of this.

39:59.025 --> 40:11.887
But the interesting thing about it, to continue 
that a little further, was that instead of paying

39:59.025 --> 40:11.887
these people, the college put it in the bank. And 
once their successor was legally sworn in, And

40:18.826 --> 40:22.910
these people got all of their back pay in one big 
lump sum. Well, at least they didn't lose it. Yeah.

40:27.254 --> 40:29.116
Well, I'll get you these names. So you went ahead 
and you were elected when? 1971, was it? I guess so.

40:35.662 --> 40:39.066
Are you still serving on the city? No. Go a little 
bit farther. Is there anything interesting that

40:41.028 --> 40:44.631
happened while you were on the city council that 
might be interesting? worthy of note if anybody

40:45.421 --> 40:51.531
ever wants to write anything about the history of 
College Station. Can you think of any big

40:51.551 --> 40:57.760
decisions that were made or weighty proposals 
that came before the council? No, I'll write off

40:59.283 --> 41:00.745
hand. On the spur of the moment, it takes time to 
have those things come up.

41:07.897 --> 41:09.219
Fred Bryson is still... Yes, I've got to talk to 
him. We have a short tape that was made by Henry

41:10.941 --> 41:13.285
Devloff. about 30 minutes. I've got to listen to 
that before I go talk to him again, make sure I don't

41:14.346 --> 41:19.495
duplicate any material. He likes to talk. I'm sure 
he'd be a good one to do. Fred Bryson likes to talk?

41:25.285 --> 41:26.227
Oh, yes, yes. Well, he's a... I have a very high 
opinion of Fred Bryson, too. Yeah, he came out. I'm

41:35.423 --> 41:36.485
a Little League coach. He...
