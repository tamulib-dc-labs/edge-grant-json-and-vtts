00:01.685 --> 00:16.282
My

00:01.685 --> 00:16.282
name is Gabriel Katt and today is December 27th, 
1983. I'll be interviewing Joseph J. Sanchez,

00:16.623 --> 00:22.350
former managing director of General Motors of 
Brazil. He is now general manager of Oldsmobile.

00:28.634 --> 00:41.810
When

00:28.634 --> 00:41.810
did General Motors first expand overseas? 
General Motors first started going overseas in

00:42.731 --> 00:46.556
the late teens and the very early 20s. As an 
example, we've been in Brazil since 1926,

00:47.737 --> 00:55.907
Argentina since 1925, and Uruguay since 1926 
also. Was this pretty similar to what was

00:57.406 --> 01:03.015
happening in other large corporations? I believe 
it was. It was right after World War I and people

01:04.437 --> 01:08.764
were looking to the expanding markets outside of 
the United States. We'd lost the isolationist

01:09.405 --> 01:17.978
influence as a result of World War I and people were 
ready to expand their markets. What was produced?

01:19.850 --> 01:29.841
In those markets at first, the initial 
installations were mostly assembly plants,

01:19.850 --> 01:29.841
installations that put together the parts as 
exported from the United States. Passenger cars

01:30.662 --> 01:41.234
mainly, but the greater degree of emphasis given 
by the foreign governments, of course, were for

01:30.662 --> 01:41.234
trucks and commercials, which they felt would be 
more useful in developing their war-torn

01:30.662 --> 01:41.234
economies. How do these overseas operations fit 
into the General Motors corporate structure?

01:48.908 --> 01:53.274
Well, at that point in time, a separate 
organization was set up to handle them, which is

01:48.908 --> 01:53.274
still in existence. It was called General Motors 
Overseas Operations, headquartered in New York

01:53.354 --> 02:05.090
City, not in Detroit, and handled as a separate 
division within the corporation. Okay. Since

02:06.392 --> 02:11.840
1950, the automotive industry has been growing 
faster in underdeveloped countries than in

02:06.392 --> 02:11.840
developed countries. What's caused this 
increased interest in the underdeveloped

02:11.920 --> 02:14.864
nations? Well... Again, since 1950, that's the 
tail end of World War II, and every one of those

02:16.617 --> 02:34.882
nations is interested in the development of its 
economy, which can best be done by industries such

02:16.617 --> 02:34.882
as the automotive industry, which are heavily 
weighted towards labor and technological

02:16.617 --> 02:34.882
development. Okay. What kind of restrictions do 
these governments place on companies interested

02:36.865 --> 02:42.793
in establishing plants in South America? Well, 
the great majority of the South American

02:43.178 --> 02:51.907
countries said, if you want to participate in our 
markets, you've got to make an investment and

02:43.178 --> 02:51.907
establish an industry in our country. Otherwise, 
we are not going to let you continue shipping your

02:51.987 --> 03:02.679
vehicles from your home plant into our country, 
draining off our foreign exchange without

02:51.987 --> 03:02.679
contributing anything to our development. So 
what kind of incentives did these multinational

03:03.960 --> 03:08.245
corporations offer? Well, the most important 
incentive, of course, was access to the market.

03:11.579 --> 03:20.811
The second incentive was a set of legislation that 
permitted you to compete in those markets, make a

03:11.579 --> 03:20.811
profit, and remit those profits to your home 
office. What kind of factors did Jim look at in

03:22.213 --> 03:28.461
deciding where to go, where to build and invest? 
Pretty much the same factors that we look at in

03:28.481 --> 03:32.346
establishing any business. The size of the 
market, the potential of the market,

03:38.832 --> 03:47.742
economic studies that give us an indication as to 
where those markets are headed and whether the

03:38.832 --> 03:47.742
size of the market justifies the risk and the 
investment that we're placing in the country.

03:48.623 --> 03:57.333
Quite a bit of emphasis is given to a forecast of 
political stability, although that lately has

03:48.623 --> 03:57.333
been very, very uncertain. Okay. What kind of 
benefits does a country receive from a

03:57.773 --> 04:03.539
multinational corporation's investment in that 
country, such as labor? First and foremost, the

04:05.261 --> 04:07.624
capital investment that comes in. which gives the 
country an aura of economic respectability and

04:08.313 --> 04:15.883
thereby enhances its ability to go out and borrow 
money from other sources. In other words, the

04:15.923 --> 04:30.383
banking system looks more favorably upon a 
country that has a massive investment from a

04:15.923 --> 04:30.383
General Motors or a Ford or a General Electric than 
it would if it were strictly an underdeveloped

04:15.923 --> 04:30.383
nation without any of the private sector taking 
any of the risks. The other investments, of

04:31.024 --> 04:38.033
course, are the jobs that are made available 
because of the establishment of the industry.

04:38.907 --> 04:50.483
technical improvement in the preparation of 
their people, because they've got to be trained to

04:38.907 --> 04:50.483
do their job in an automotive plant, and the 
general positive impact on the balance of

04:38.907 --> 04:50.483
payments of their country. Is there any cultural 
exchange that is offered by General Motors, for

04:51.804 --> 04:56.651
example? Well, General Motors offers a cultural 
exchange that I guess could better be defined as an

04:57.372 --> 05:03.260
educational exchange. As you know, we've got one 
of the finest universities in the United States,

05:03.360 --> 05:08.627
the General Motors Institute. And in Brazil, for 
example, almost 200 of my executives in Brazil had

05:08.962 --> 05:18.716
attended General Motors Institute for at least 
one year, and most of them had been on a two-year

05:08.962 --> 05:18.716
program. So in that sense, you've got a massive 
transfer of cultures through the educational

05:19.397 --> 05:26.006
system in the United States. So these are already 
employed executives? In most cases from

05:31.954 --> 05:38.023
overseas, they are employed executives or sons of 
existing General Motors dealers. Okay, so is

05:38.678 --> 05:45.468
there any opportunity for maybe just extremely 
bright students to have that opportunity? In two

05:46.269 --> 06:02.271
of the countries, Argentina and Brazil, and I 
believe in Venezuela also, we had a scholarship

05:46.269 --> 06:02.271
program for promising students, which enabled 
them to come up and complete their education here

05:46.269 --> 06:02.271
in the United States on a general scholarship. 
Okay. Does the federal government encourage or

06:03.113 --> 06:07.639
discourage investment and expansion overseas? 
The federal government of the United States

06:08.041 --> 06:14.071
doesn't really encourage or discourage. It 
encourages because it would like to continue

06:14.131 --> 06:27.151
improving the exports from the United States and 
thereby help in our balance of payments problem,

06:14.131 --> 06:27.151
but it doesn't do anything specific as far as 
offering incentives like many other countries

06:14.131 --> 06:27.151
do. In other words, they don't offer special tax 
incentives like the Japanese do.

06:34.503 --> 06:35.905
In general, it's just... a moral encouragement to 
industry to get out and compete in those markets.

06:41.002 --> 06:48.134
This hasn't changed any with the problems we're 
having now, say, with Japan and the competition

06:41.002 --> 06:48.134
there? No, it's changed very little outside of the 
Overseas Investment Bank, which has some very,

06:48.555 --> 06:57.150
very stringent rules and really is not 
competitive in overseas markets. The United

06:57.603 --> 07:15.925
States government does not assist in exporting 
from the United States other than through

06:57.603 --> 07:15.925
information services, but does not offer 
specific incentives, again, like tax

06:57.603 --> 07:15.925
incentives, like rebate incentives, like so many 
of the others that the other countries use around

06:57.603 --> 07:15.925
the world, Brazil and Japan particularly. Do U.S. 
companies overseas get taxed twice, once by the

07:18.168 --> 07:24.175
host country and once by the U.S.? No, not really. 
I'm not an expert on tax matters, but They don't get

07:28.096 --> 07:29.318
taxed twice. They can deduct their foreign taxes 
from the United States taxes, so they only pay

07:29.358 --> 07:34.645
taxes once. And I see what you're getting at. In 
that sense, that is a benefit. However, what I was

07:39.312 --> 07:47.925
thinking of was a corporate tax rate in the United 
States of 48% and a corporate tax rate in Japan on

07:39.312 --> 07:47.925
exports of 24%. Yeah, I was thinking of it of a much 
more positive advantage as opposed to just

07:47.945 --> 07:54.915
avoiding a negative of double taxation. Okay. So 
what about the guarantee program? Guarantee in

08:01.632 --> 08:02.854
what sense?

08:05.618 --> 08:15.474
I guess it would affect oil companies mostly when a 
country is taken over or something and they start

08:05.618 --> 08:15.474
nationalizing all industry. You can get 
political risk insurance for your foreign

08:15.534 --> 08:21.443
investment, and that's true. That is a very 
definite benefit. As a matter of fact, we had

08:23.412 --> 08:35.029
political risk insurance in Chile when our 
assembly plant was taken over by the Allende

08:23.412 --> 08:35.029
government in, I believe, right at the very early 
70s, right around 1970. And the insurance does

08:36.491 --> 08:43.681
cover you against the takeover of your facilities 
as a result of political upheaval. I believe that

08:45.504 --> 08:53.115
that insurance is backed by the U.S. government, 
but I also believe a lot of private insurance

08:45.504 --> 08:53.115
companies are involved in it. Okay. How does the 
fact that a tremendous number of American

08:55.029 --> 09:03.163
corporations are building plants and expanding 
overseas affect the U.S. economic and labor

08:55.029 --> 09:03.163
situation? Well, so far it's been proven that the 
more plants that are established overseas by

09:04.164 --> 09:18.529
United States companies, the more jobs are 
created in the United States.

09:19.353 --> 09:21.878
a requirement for the establishment of those 
plants. You need the technicians, you need the

09:21.898 --> 09:24.983
technology, you need the supervision. Once the 
plant is established and producing a consumer

09:26.065 --> 09:40.591
product, which can be back shipped into the United 
States, that of course could have a negative

09:26.065 --> 09:40.591
impact on that particular industry for those 
particular products. I think the biggest concern

09:40.612 --> 09:43.116
in not allowing U.S. companies to establish 
overseas and export their products to the United

09:43.771 --> 09:54.122
States would be the very negative reaction from 
foreign governments which would then shut off

09:43.771 --> 09:54.122
other industries or other products. For example, 
not allowing Japanese cars to come into the United

09:55.483 --> 10:10.318
States could create the problem of the Japanese 
not importing computers or agricultural

10:10.973 --> 10:14.096
products or something in another line. The labor 
unions generally are the most vocal about

10:16.078 --> 10:22.224
overseas investment. Is there a lot of pressure by 
the labor unions directed at domestic companies

10:22.244 --> 10:30.212
to halt or slow down investment or change their 
policies overseas? There is a lot of pressure, but

10:30.232 --> 10:37.078
naturally the majority of the pressure comes on 
the part of the unions on government in

10:30.232 --> 10:37.078
Washington. You're right at the present time, as 
you probably know. the unions are promoting what

10:40.353 --> 10:58.421
they call a local content law in the automotive 
industry, which would require an imported car

10:40.353 --> 10:58.421
into the United States to have a certain 
percentage of United States parts in the car

10:40.353 --> 10:58.421
before it could be imported, thereby, in the 
union's view, generating jobs for those

10:40.353 --> 10:58.421
industries that manufacture those parts. This is 
very common around the world. This is not an

11:01.125 --> 11:02.547
original idea. In Brazil, for example, every 
vehicle produced in Brazil had to have 85%

11:08.011 --> 11:21.191
Brazilian parts before it could be built and sold 
in the country, thereby guaranteeing local

11:08.011 --> 11:21.191
industry, local labor, and a tactic of an 
underdeveloped nation to continue protecting

11:08.011 --> 11:21.191
its jobs. So that kind of pressure does exist. The 
law has passed Congress at the present time. It

11:28.201 --> 11:30.204
probably will not pass the Senate. It will 
probably be rejected in the Senate. And if it is not

11:31.947 --> 11:33.529
rejected in the Senate, President Reagan has 
promised to veto it anyway, so it doesn't seem like

11:33.998 --> 11:38.104
it's going to prosper. Is this due to auto industry 
pressure or counter-lobbying? Well, do you mean

11:44.554 --> 11:46.476
the veto of the law? Yeah. No, I think the 
automotive industry has, in general... Now, let

11:47.077 --> 11:52.646
me be more specific. Chrysler Corporation has 
come out in favor of such a law. As a matter of fact,

11:55.350 --> 11:59.736
Lee Iacocca believes that it should be in 
existence, thereby defending U.S. jobs. Both

12:00.509 --> 12:04.553
Ford and General Motors have adopted a very 
neutral attitude towards the law. I think in our

12:05.233 --> 12:20.467
particular case, General Motors recognizes that 
that kind of legal restriction would probably

12:05.233 --> 12:20.467
only generate major problems for us in our other 
facilities around the world and would be of no

12:05.233 --> 12:20.467
immediate benefit to us. Chrysler, on the other 
hand, like I say, does support it, so there is a

12:21.468 --> 12:26.332
split decision on the part of the industry. And as 
far as I know, the only lobbying that's going on for

12:26.353 --> 12:29.115
that law is in favor of the law on the part of 
Chrysler Corporation. OK. What kind of

12:35.127 --> 12:41.212
integration is there with local industries as far 
as supplies and sales go? In an overseas country?

12:43.854 --> 12:55.545
Integration in the sense of the car manufacturer, 
like General Motors, being a partner with the

12:43.854 --> 12:55.545
suppliers, or

12:43.854 --> 12:55.545
we normally are not partners with our suppliers. 
We do not invest capital in our suppliers What we do

12:59.504 --> 13:05.550
do in most cases in these underdeveloped nations 
is we go to a supplier that has potential. Let's

13:06.711 --> 13:12.857
take a metal bender somewhere in Uruguay that 
thinks he can perhaps manufacture a radiator. We

13:13.778 --> 13:29.072
will go in there with our specifications, our 
designs, and our engineers, literally set him up

13:13.778 --> 13:29.072
in business, recommend the equipment he has to 
buy, give him the specifications of the radiators

13:13.778 --> 13:29.072
we will buy, loan him the money for his initial 
investment in raw materials and inventory,

13:29.288 --> 13:49.731
promise him that we will buy the product once he 
manufactures it for us, prepay for the product

13:29.288 --> 13:49.731
before we even receive it, and in that way take 
somebody who's got no capital but has some budding

13:29.288 --> 13:49.731
talent and get him into the business and try to turn 
him into a reliable supplier over time. So that

13:50.772 --> 13:58.941
it's almost a red cross of automotive suppliers in 
order to get some of these emerging nations

13:50.772 --> 13:58.941
started into the automotive business. Okay. How 
much of what's produced in the jam plants is

14:02.694 --> 14:06.338
exported? In our overseas plants? Well, in Latin 
America, relatively little. In Brazil, in its

14:12.864 --> 14:23.235
biggest year, which was 1981, we produced about 
230,000 cars and trucks, of which a little over

14:12.864 --> 14:23.235
20,000 were exported. So about 10% of our 
production was exported, and they were exported

14:23.315 --> 14:30.582
exclusively to other Latin American countries. 
some African republics. Atom opal in Germany is

14:33.074 --> 14:35.277
our largest exporter. It produces about a million 
units a year of which it, and it absorbs perhaps

14:35.317 --> 14:44.967
around a half a million in the German market and the 
other half million is exported to the other

14:35.317 --> 14:44.967
European markets. We do very little exporting of 
cars and trucks to the United States for a number of

14:46.329 --> 14:52.676
reasons. One of which is that the most important of 
which is that U.S. legislation on the vehicle is

14:53.036 --> 14:59.623
both safety and and pollution-type legislation 
virtually precludes the foreign-built cars that

15:00.329 --> 15:09.102
we make from coming back into the United States. 
What about parts production? Parts? And being

15:14.790 --> 15:16.753
exported back to the States? That we do quite a bit 
of. In Mexico, for example, you've got a number of

15:18.616 --> 15:24.885
plants, border plants, that are set up according 
to regulations Mexican legislation, which

15:25.304 --> 15:28.671
produced parts and are exported to the United 
States. We have an extensive exchange. And I must

15:33.021 --> 15:40.437
apologize because my experience of overseas, 
when I say overseas, I mean outside of North

15:33.021 --> 15:40.437
America. I keep forgetting that Canada is an 
independent country. nation on our northern

15:43.495 --> 15:58.271
border, quite a number of cars are produced in 
Canada and back shipped into the United States in

15:43.495 --> 15:58.271
accordance with the automotive trade agreement 
between the two countries where parts go to

15:43.495 --> 15:58.271
Canada, Canada makes the cars and then exports 
them back into the United States. That whole

15:59.071 --> 16:06.519
exchange with Canada is very positive for the 
United States, both in balance of payments and in

15:59.071 --> 16:06.519
the efficiency of the use of facilities. But 
excluding Canada from any of my comments, we do

16:06.659 --> 16:12.085
ship parts in here from Mexico. uh including some 
engines we export engines from brazil into the

16:13.027 --> 16:38.022
united states we export some electrical 
components from singapore and hong kong and an

16:13.027 --> 16:38.022
extensive part shipment does go on from other 
countries back into the united states okay do any

16:13.027 --> 16:38.022
south american countries have labor unions or 
organizations like that oh they all do they all do

16:13.027 --> 16:38.022
are they as well organized as they are here as 
powerful Depends on the country. Argentina in

16:39.970 --> 16:44.817
1972, the labor unions became so powerful that 
they became unwieldy. They became so powerful

16:45.978 --> 16:53.208
that they literally brought the country to its 
knees with a power that was totally misused.

16:53.769 --> 17:02.001
Brazil, on the other hand, has had labor unions for 
many, many years, and they have been relatively

16:53.769 --> 17:02.001
ineffective because the government did not allow 
them to exercise power. the normal prerogatives

17:02.555 --> 17:05.740
as we know them here in the United States. A labor 
union in Brazil, for example, until 1981 could

17:06.381 --> 17:13.893
only negotiate non-economic issues. In other 
words, the government decided what the wage

17:13.973 --> 17:26.773
increases and what the benefits were going to be to 
the workers, and the union itself only could

17:13.973 --> 17:26.773
negotiate perhaps overtime legislation, 
perhaps vacation legislation. items that were

17:27.158 --> 17:33.790
minor in the minds of the workers and thereby took 
away from the strength of that particular union.

17:33.890 --> 17:41.604
So you've got unions at all levels and at all 
degrees of effectiveness.

17:45.510 --> 17:49.217
What positions in a GM plant are filled by American 
employees? Well, the obvious answer is those

17:49.923 --> 17:55.431
positions that can't be filled adequately by 
local employees. Let me give you an example. In

17:56.692 --> 18:05.284
Brazil, we had 23,000 people working in the 
company, and we had 18 Americans, U.S. employees,

17:56.692 --> 18:05.284
in the company. And of those U.S. employees, eight 
of the 18 were in staff positions. The other eight

18:12.734 --> 18:15.358
staff positions were filled by Brazilians. The 
remainder of the Americans, the other ten, The

18:18.813 --> 18:20.636
majority of them reported to Brazilians. But 
there were technicians, technicians in the

18:21.417 --> 18:24.923
financial sense mostly. We had five technicians 
from GMAC in the United States down there helping

18:24.943 --> 18:30.733
us run our finance company. And we had three 
finance department technicians in the finance

18:31.214 --> 18:40.790
department, treasury and controller, in the 
money-raising aspects of the business. But in

18:41.151 --> 18:43.555
general, our policy is that a Brazilian should 
fill any position that he's qualified to fill. We

18:47.802 --> 18:52.029
would rather have a Brazilian executive in the job 
than an American executive. What do you mean by

18:52.049 --> 18:54.554
staff position? Staff position? There were 16 
people on my staff, of which 10 were major

18:55.315 --> 18:59.442
department heads. They headed up departments 
such as engineering, manufacturing, finance,

19:00.603 --> 19:09.458
reliability, sales, Those are the major 
department heads. And then there were another six

19:11.500 --> 19:20.397
positions that were the subsidiary ones, like the 
head of the finance company or the controller or

19:11.500 --> 19:20.397
the director of public relations or the director 
of government relations. And those 16 people were

19:21.178 --> 19:27.490
my cadre, which met on a weekly basis to establish 
the policy for the company. And of those 16... half

19:28.979 --> 19:32.122
were Brazilian and half were Americans, not by 
design. That's not part of a policy 50-50. On the

19:35.826 --> 19:41.793
contrary, as I said before, the policy is, if we can 
at all do it, to have 100% Brazilians in the job. Is

19:42.934 --> 19:50.702
the local employee restricted to promotion 
within plants in that country, or could he

19:42.934 --> 19:50.702
theoretically be transferred to the U.S.? On the 
contrary, we encourage the same policy that we

19:50.743 --> 19:57.670
follow here in the United States, where we're 
encouraging Americans to take an overseas

19:50.743 --> 19:57.670
assignment as part of their career development 
path. And in overseas territories, we do the same

20:01.531 --> 20:05.777
thing with overseas employees. We encourage 
Brazilians to take assignments outside of

20:05.817 --> 20:16.230
Brazil, just as we encourage Germans to take 
assignments outside of Germany to better prepare

20:05.817 --> 20:16.230
them for their careers in their own countries. Is 
there any, let's see how to put this, how do

20:17.332 --> 20:28.146
American employees, I mean in America, react to 
having foreign bosses? In their overseas

20:28.784 --> 20:30.085
assignments? No, here. Here in the United States? 
Yeah, okay, the foreign manager in his overseas

20:32.427 --> 20:41.676
assignment to the States, for example. You mean a 
Brazilian back to the United States? How would the

20:44.258 --> 20:46.920
American react working for a Brazilian? Yeah, is 
there ever any problem with that? Never any real

20:49.343 --> 20:58.791
problem, and I hesitate to answer the question 
because there's always a little bit of

20:49.343 --> 20:58.791
differences in national ways of thinking A 
Brazilian will focus on a problem a little bit

20:58.889 --> 21:02.498
different than an American. And if the American or 
the Brazilian, it's vice versa, they reply. If the

21:09.133 --> 21:15.649
American or the Brazilian doesn't recognize that 
that is the foreign way of doing things and that the

21:09.133 --> 21:15.649
man is very, very capable... There is a little bit 
of a resentment and a feeling that perhaps the boss

21:16.220 --> 21:20.927
doesn't know as much as he should know. In most 
cases, they recognize the fact that the man has

21:22.509 --> 21:27.856
been put in that job because he has the capability 
to handle it. And once they get used to his

21:28.617 --> 21:34.145
techniques, his way of thinking, his way of 
approaching the job, we have no problems. In

21:34.265 --> 21:41.215
general, with some exceptions like anything else 
in this world, but in general, it's been a very,

21:34.265 --> 21:41.215
very effective way of training our people, both 
U.S. people overseas or overseas people in the

21:41.836 --> 21:47.042
United States. Do many women rise to management or 
supervisory positions, or does this depend on the

21:48.183 --> 21:56.312
country in South America where a plant is located? 
A lot of it depends on the country, but

21:57.073 --> 22:09.126
unfortunately, you know, women in the automotive 
business have not had the tremendous levels of

21:57.073 --> 22:09.126
success that they have in other industries, and 
It's a little bit difficult to explain why that is.

22:12.228 --> 22:17.413
I guess that so many of the success paths in our 
industry are up the sales side. And it is very

22:18.434 --> 22:29.565
difficult for a woman to break into the automotive 
sales end of the business, going out around the

22:18.434 --> 22:29.565
country, calling on dealers as the men do. It's 
been something that in Latin American countries

22:29.725 --> 22:34.129
has been very difficult for them to accept. We had 
one woman in our management, out of our top

22:34.990 --> 22:39.214
management in Brazil, of approximately 90 
executives. We had one woman that had achieved

22:41.873 --> 22:43.716
that level. And fortunately, in the last five or 
six years, there were another five that were

22:44.637 --> 22:55.229
progressing to the point where I believe by 1984 or 
5, they will also be joining the group. So the

22:55.249 --> 23:01.476
process is accelerating, but it is substantially 
behind where it is in the United States. Are there

23:02.678 --> 23:09.606
any minority employment problems in South 
American countries? Broad question. Very, very

23:11.074 --> 23:13.619
broad question. I guess we could start off by 
asking the question, are there minorities in some

23:14.080 --> 23:17.927
of these countries? And I guess there are, just 
like there are in the United States. But, for

23:20.913 --> 23:31.392
example, a black, by virtue of the fact that there 
are so few of them, is very definitely a minority in

23:20.913 --> 23:31.392
Argentina and Chile, for example. A black, on the 
other hand, is not a minority in Brazil by virtue of

23:31.928 --> 23:36.512
the fact that there are so many of them. And there's 
been such a mixing of the races over the last 100

23:36.712 --> 23:57.651
years in Brazil as opposed to the other countries 
so that Brazil does not feel that it has any kind of a

23:36.712 --> 23:57.651
racial problem, although blacks do have 
difficulty getting the same educational

23:36.712 --> 23:57.651
treatment and the same employment treatment, but 
Brazilians do not look upon them as minorities.

23:57.831 --> 24:01.935
So, yes, in some countries you've got a minority 
problem, black rising to the hierarchy of

24:02.320 --> 24:07.866
management in Argentina, for example, I believe 
is totally unknown. Not so in Brazil, where

24:09.008 --> 24:12.972
national heroes, sporting heroes are black. 
There have been political leaders that are blacks

24:14.494 --> 24:21.882
that are recognized as outstanding citizens by 
their own people. So it varies from country to

24:23.104 --> 24:24.766
country. The further north you get in South 
America, the less likely it is that the blacks are

24:32.830 --> 24:43.305
considered minorities, and I'm saying this 
incorrectly, the further north you progress, the

24:32.830 --> 24:43.305
more integrated the blacks are into the economy 
and into the national life of their country. The

24:44.326 --> 24:59.448
southern countries, by virtue of the fact of 
having received very few blacks originally, as a

24:44.326 --> 24:59.448
result of the slaves being brought over from 
Africa back in the 18th and 19th centuries, have

24:44.326 --> 24:59.448
very few blacks, and there they are minorities. 
Chile, Argentina, for example. And so are they

25:02.446 --> 25:08.973
discriminated against in that sense, whatever 
would constitute a minority? I think you see

25:09.373 --> 25:23.228
discrimination in the same fashion that we had it 
in the United States 30 years ago, where it was

25:09.373 --> 25:23.228
covert discrimination more than overt 
discrimination. And I guess I'm talking about

25:23.268 --> 25:27.492
that point in time when the signs stopped reading 
sit in the back of the bus or for whites only in the

25:27.961 --> 25:32.868
northern cities. That kind of discrimination I 
have not seen. But the covert kind, I guess, is the

25:37.735 --> 25:43.984
more pernicious. It's the one that when you look 
around an office, you don't see any black people in

25:44.124 --> 25:55.441
the office, or you don't see any women who are also 
minorities in a lot of these cases in the office.

25:55.461 --> 25:56.783
You see only white males. And You ask yourself what 
has happened to the fabric of the country that has

25:57.526 --> 26:08.661
created this situation where only white males can 
sit in this job and 100 desk jobs and they're all

25:57.526 --> 26:08.661
white males. There's not a single woman and not a 
single black. And you trace it back and you find out

26:11.564 --> 26:16.451
that they're still not getting the same 
educational opportunities. They're not getting

26:17.773 --> 26:19.875
the same advancement opportunities. Now, in all 
of these countries, I think without exception,

26:21.037 --> 26:27.145
massive steps have been taken to correct this. And 
I believe that the leader in doing all this has been

26:28.053 --> 26:31.238
the United States. I think the United States' 
example of what we have gone through over the past

26:31.298 --> 26:54.010
30 years in trying to correct the minority 
treatment situation has received such favorable

26:31.298 --> 26:54.010
press and such a spotlight of attention from the 
countries in Latin America that they themselves,

26:31.298 --> 26:54.010
whether they know it or not, are following our 
example.

26:54.209 --> 27:00.809
Did the energy crisis in the early 70s have as 
profound an effect in South America as it did in the

26:54.209 --> 27:00.809
United States? Oh, very much so, particularly in 
those countries that were very strong net

27:04.418 --> 27:10.525
importers of petroleum products like Brazil, 
like Uruguay. Uruguay imports 100% of its

27:10.685 --> 27:13.268
petroleum requirements. Brazil was importing 
85% of its requirements when the first crisis hit.

27:20.015 --> 27:28.444
Terrible impact on the economies, particularly 
from the inflationary point of view, as their

27:20.015 --> 27:28.444
petroleum costs doubled, tripled, and 
quadrupled over a very short period of time. So

27:29.245 --> 27:32.569
that the economies were caught totally 
unprepared, and I think Some of the things you're

27:33.123 --> 27:45.681
seeing now in the Brazilian economy particularly 
and in the economy of an Uruguay and an Ecuador and a

27:33.123 --> 27:45.681
Chile are still the strong aftershocks of that 
energy crisis. Their incredible inflation rate?

27:49.526 --> 27:49.806
Yes. They've never been able to bring it back down 
to manageable levels. Once it achieved a level of

27:53.051 --> 28:01.543
30 to 40 percent a year as a result of the energy 
shock, it just picked up momentum and swept on up

27:53.051 --> 28:01.543
from that level. What kind of changes were 
implemented in car production in South America as

28:02.013 --> 28:07.979
a result of the crisis? Well, the biggest change 
that took place as a result of the crisis was that

28:08.699 --> 28:17.528
the markets went into a stalemate position, into 
stagnation. Markets fell off and the volume fell

28:18.429 --> 28:20.631
off sharply. Brazil was the only one that adopted, 
after the second energy crisis in the late 70s, an

28:21.652 --> 28:30.180
alternate fuels program. trying to develop the 
usage of alcohol in passenger car engines and

28:30.633 --> 28:43.753
thereby maintaining their industrial 
production at a high level regardless of what was

28:30.633 --> 28:43.753
happening outside with OPEC. They were very 
successful with that program. Today, over 95% of

28:46.538 --> 28:52.567
all the cars produced in Brazil have 100% ethyl 
alcohol engines. And they themselves now have

28:53.568 --> 28:57.214
been able to produce over 40% of their petroleum 
requirements and have cut down their dependency

28:57.903 --> 29:06.937
on outside petroleum sources substantially from 
where they were five and six years ago. No other

29:07.898 --> 29:10.462
countries down there are following their lead? No 
other countries following their lead, to my

29:11.263 --> 29:13.367
knowledge. There have been interested nations. 
South Africa, who finds itself isolated from the

29:15.770 --> 29:18.955
rest of the world. Indonesia, who has the 
potential for... producing the necessary sugar

29:24.937 --> 29:32.305
cane to generate sufficient alcohol in 
quantities that would make this feasible. The

29:32.345 --> 29:34.547
Philippines finds themselves in the same 
situation. But none of those countries has gotten

29:35.368 --> 29:49.143
it off the ground as yet, other than for a minor 
gasohol-type program, where 10% or less of the

29:35.368 --> 29:49.143
fuel pumped into your tank is alcohol combined 
with gasoline. Brazil is the only one that had the

29:49.163 --> 29:51.045
land area. had the necessary government 
conditions in place to overnight put a program of

29:51.667 --> 30:02.304
this dimension into effect and did it very, very 
successfully. And General Motors and Ford,

30:02.645 --> 30:06.691
whoever else down there, were all involved in 
this? All directly involved. As a matter of fact,

30:07.713 --> 30:10.738
the first meetings that were held on this subject 
were with the Minister of Industry in 1977, and I

30:11.495 --> 30:21.969
participated in those meetings, and we were given 
two years to get the program into effect to develop

30:11.495 --> 30:21.969
engines that ran 100% on alcohol. We asked for 
three, we were given two, and the consequences

30:23.111 --> 30:28.178
were almost predictable. We produced the 
original vehicles, and we had very serious

30:28.618 --> 30:37.791
quality and service problems with them, not 
having had sufficient time to test them

30:28.618 --> 30:37.791
adequately. But by the end of the first year and a 
half of the program, The engines were as reliable

30:41.549 --> 30:51.503
as the current gasoline engines had been once we'd 
taken out all of the potential for corrosion,

30:41.549 --> 30:51.503
which was the biggest problem we were having with 
the alcohol. And we are now, Ford, General Motors,

30:51.523 --> 31:04.240
Volkswagen, Fiat, and Mercedes-Benz, who are the 
major five in Brazil, are now the world

30:51.523 --> 31:04.240
authorities on alcohol engines. And we, in fact, 
General Motors Brazil, is the... is the alcohol

31:08.093 --> 31:11.518
project center for General Motors Corporation in 
the world. In other words, if anybody wants to know

31:11.578 --> 31:18.387
anything about alcohol engines, they consult us 
in Brazil instead of consulting the home office.

31:19.749 --> 31:22.653
OK. General Motors spent 53 years in Argentina. 
What caused them to withdraw in 78? Oh, it was a

31:24.175 --> 31:28.161
combination of offense. I was there in 1972 and 
1973, two very difficult years when Juan Domingo

31:28.394 --> 31:38.268
Peron came back and was elected as president of the 
country. Economic crisis after economic crisis,

31:39.690 --> 31:47.321
the Argentine economy riding its usual roller 
coaster of highs and lows. And we at General

31:47.341 --> 31:57.135
Motors, in expectation of better times, had been 
waiting for those better times and had allowed our

31:47.341 --> 31:57.135
product lineup to not to develop adequately and 
maintain a competitive position. So that when

32:03.195 --> 32:17.053
1979 rolled around and the Argentine government 
decided that perhaps they wanted to rationalize

32:03.195 --> 32:17.053
their industry and reduce the number of 
manufacturers in the country, we found ourselves

32:03.195 --> 32:17.053
with the necessity to make a massive investment of 
well over $100 million. And the outlook was that

32:17.874 --> 32:21.559
that investment could never be recovered. The 
market would never rise to a point that would make

32:22.280 --> 32:25.705
this a wise decision. That, coupled with the 
government's desire to cut back on manufacturers

32:26.393 --> 32:44.662
and their refusal to assist any of the 
manufacturers with any of their problems,

32:26.393 --> 32:44.662
prompted us to say, well, this is as good a time as 
any, and we shut down the operation that we'd had in

32:26.393 --> 32:44.662
Argentina since 1926.

32:47.126 --> 32:50.612
That's not the last comment on the situation, 
however. A year ago, we went back in and started

32:51.250 --> 33:01.027
negotiating with a local company in Argentina, 
some kind of a joint venture whereby the local

32:51.250 --> 33:01.027
company could perhaps assemble our products for 
us in that country. And I would not be surprised to

33:02.009 --> 33:09.402
see General Motors vehicles once again sold in 
Argentina inside of 24 months. In the 60s in Chile,

33:09.422 --> 33:14.992
many locally owned auto companies went out of 
business or were taken over by foreign firms. Why

33:15.052 --> 33:15.773
was that? Well, in the 60s, you actually had two 
series of problems. In the very early 60s, and I

33:20.392 --> 33:25.958
arrived in Chile on August 1, 1960, so I'm familiar 
with it. The government wanted to develop its

33:26.819 --> 33:32.266
national industry, as I said at the beginning of 
this interview. And they, at the same time, wanted

33:32.766 --> 33:38.453
to defend their national boundaries against 
their sworn enemy, Peru. So they selected a city

33:39.310 --> 33:58.276
called Arica on the very northern tip of Chile and 
created a free zone and told everybody that they

33:39.310 --> 33:58.276
could establish automotive industries in the 
city of Arica on a no-duty basis, which would make

33:39.310 --> 33:58.276
it a very favorable competitor with the rest of the 
country, and put the legislation in place to make

33:39.310 --> 33:58.276
it happen. However, they also insisted that they 
had to be national companies. So at that point in

34:01.400 --> 34:13.855
time, Ford, which was about the only one that had 
maintained an investment in that country, closed

34:01.400 --> 34:13.855
up shop and the assembly plants in Arica were 
established by Chilean car dealers. At the end of

34:14.937 --> 34:29.955
the decade, when Salvador Allende came in as 
president, Salvador Allende, as you know, was a

34:14.937 --> 34:29.955
socialist president and a great part of his 
cabinet were communists, decided to take over the

34:14.937 --> 34:29.955
major industries in the country. And one of these 
was the General Motors plant. By that time, we were

34:33.073 --> 34:34.575
back in the country. In other words, the dealer had 
established the industry in 1964. We had

34:38.902 --> 34:40.484
purchased it from him in 1969. Allende took it away 
from us in 1971. When Allende committed suicide in

34:43.569 --> 34:50.800
1973, the new military government asked us to take 
it back. We have taken it back. We're now operating

34:52.061 --> 34:53.023
it. So it's been a little bit of a roller coaster 
revolving door yo-yo type program in Chile over

34:53.103 --> 34:59.773
the last 20 years with uh the chileans having 
difficulty making up their mind what they want the

35:00.496 --> 35:28.275
industry to do and general mode is trying to react 
to whatever new set of circumstances appeared on

35:00.496 --> 35:28.275
the horizon okay brazil has shown tremendous 
growth and development in the past years what role

35:00.496 --> 35:28.275
have multinational corporations and gm in 
specific played in this growth well the

35:00.496 --> 35:28.275
multinational corporations have played a key 
role in this growth the revolution took place in

35:00.496 --> 35:28.275
1963

35:29.015 --> 35:42.417
The legislation was put in place to encourage 
foreign investments by 1967-68, and General

35:29.015 --> 35:42.417
Motors was one of the first to make a large 
investment in the country to manufacture

35:29.015 --> 35:42.417
passenger cars. We had been assembling vehicles 
since the middle 20s, as I mentioned before. It

35:48.117 --> 35:48.958
wasn't just us. It was a number of other major 
multinational corporations, including

35:49.058 --> 35:55.367
multinational corporations that manufacture 
parts. And when we talk about multinational,

35:55.527 --> 36:01.916
let's not just think of U.S. corporations, but a 
lot of European corporations came in also. Bosch

36:01.996 --> 36:04.980
came in, manufactured electrical equipment. 
Fiat came in with its latest technology. So that

36:11.148 --> 36:17.517
the backing of these multinational companies 
with its investment gave Brazil the needed

36:11.148 --> 36:17.517
capital to put its vaunted economic miracle in 
place. As you will recall, the Brazilian economy,

36:21.573 --> 36:32.209
until the second oil shock, was growing at a rate of 
6% to 8% a year and was being called the economic

36:21.573 --> 36:32.209
miracle of the world because of its tremendous 
success. Since then, of course, events have

36:32.509 --> 36:38.578
caught up with it, and it's no longer an economic 
miracle because people realize that they've done

36:32.509 --> 36:38.578
it all. They've done a great part of it on borrowed 
funds that it appears cannot be repaid at an

36:40.201 --> 36:46.710
appropriate time. But General Motors was a key 
part in this development, and during my years

36:47.585 --> 37:10.943
there since 1976, not unusual for a new investor to 
come to General Motors and ask to talk to us

36:47.585 --> 37:10.943
specifically on our experiences in the country 
with the government, what we thought of the future

36:47.585 --> 37:10.943
of the country, what we thought of doing business 
in Brazil, how we felt we were being treated. make

37:11.564 --> 37:25.531
its decisions according to the recommendations 
it received from people like ourselves who had no

37:11.564 --> 37:25.531
political axe to grind and who apparently 
maintained a higher degree of credibility with

37:11.564 --> 37:25.531
new investors than a foreign government could. So 
they played an extremely key and important role in

37:25.551 --> 37:29.218
the development of the country. Does industry 
work in conjunction with the U.S. government in

37:30.818 --> 37:37.607
any aspect of U.S. foreign policy? By industry, I 
mean American industry. No, none. As far as

37:42.013 --> 37:43.696
foreign policy is concerned, none. We must 
follow, according to U.S. law, U.S. legislation.

37:50.645 --> 37:56.573
For example, despite the fact that General Motors 
Brazil is a Brazilian company, we could not sell

37:50.645 --> 37:56.573
products to any of those countries on the 
so-called United States blacklist, which is a

37:57.059 --> 38:13.498
very limited group of countries, but right now 
consists of North Korea, Cuba, I don't know,

37:57.059 --> 38:13.498
there's three others or thereabouts, but 
countries that the United States government felt

37:57.059 --> 38:13.498
were a threat to its security. Russia and China, by 
the way, are not on that list, just to give you an

38:14.170 --> 38:20.706
idea of the specific nature of the list. So we had to 
follow U.S. legislation. But as far as

38:22.610 --> 38:29.968
influencing or assisting U.S. foreign policy, 
none of that went on specifically. Okay. Did you

38:33.072 --> 38:36.576
ever deal personally with any South American 
political figures? Oh, yeah, on a constant basis.

38:40.960 --> 38:47.647
See, you have to remember, for example, General 
Motors in Brazil was the fifth largest privately

38:40.960 --> 38:47.647
owned corporation in the country. That would be 
like being the president or the chairman of Ford

38:49.329 --> 38:56.416
here in the United States. And I had the same access 
to the Brazilian government that the president of

39:00.914 --> 39:05.961
Ford would have to the United States government 
because of its importance to the national

39:00.914 --> 39:05.961
economy. So I dealt with Salvador Allende in Chile 
when he was a senator before he became president. I

39:12.610 --> 39:13.792
met him while he was president. I've met the 
presidents and the cabinet members even more

39:13.992 --> 39:21.283
importantly because the cabinet members are the 
ones that established the industrial policy. In

39:22.104 --> 39:30.195
Argentina, in Uruguay, in Brazil, in Venezuela, 
in every country that we're established, we are a

39:22.104 --> 39:30.195
very powerful force from a world image point of 
view, it's very important for a government to say

39:30.563 --> 39:37.831
that General Motors has an operation in their 
country. It gives them an international level of

39:38.752 --> 39:43.918
stability that they're very anxious to maintain. 
And as a result, the contacts are continuous. You

39:48.323 --> 39:49.664
talk about an image. Well, so then a country is able 
to get, let's say, all the loans that Brazil got.

39:56.312 --> 39:57.313
What's going to happen? What can potentially 
happen when a country like Brazil right now can't

39:57.968 --> 40:05.562
pay back all that money? I've read a lot of 
scenarios, and I was on the scene for quite a long

40:05.643 --> 40:13.277
time.

40:13.493 --> 40:39.197
disaster scenario of course is that they don't pay 
declare a moratorium in the united states banking

40:13.493 --> 40:39.197
system collapses right uh i don't think that's 
going to happen at all i think what's going to

40:13.493 --> 40:39.197
happen is is a little bit of more of the same i think 
that the united that the banking system itself is

40:13.493 --> 40:39.197
to blame for a lot of what's happened uh i know 
personally people that were in brazil soliciting

40:13.493 --> 40:39.197
the brazilian government to take additional 
loans at very attractive interest rates

40:39.768 --> 40:50.565
advantageous to the banking system at a point in 
time when Brazil, it was very, very clear that

40:39.768 --> 40:50.565
their balance of payments was not generating 
enough funds to pay off those debts. The banking

40:51.887 --> 41:02.164
system has gotten much more cautious, much more 
realistic in releasing new loans, and Brazil

40:51.887 --> 41:02.164
finds itself in a position of over $90 billion in 
debt. with just an interest amortization on that

41:02.853 --> 41:10.745
debt of $8 to $9 billion a year and a favorable 
balance of payments. This year, it's going to be

41:10.765 --> 41:15.832
their most favorable year ever, and they'll 
probably have a favorable balance of payments of

41:10.765 --> 41:15.832
$7 billion. So it's obvious that they can't even 
pay the interest on the loan, that they need new

41:16.774 --> 41:23.323
loans to continue paying the interest on the old 
loans. And I think that's what's going to happen. I

41:25.186 --> 41:31.375
think there's going to be a rescheduling of the 
debt, a stretching out of... of the payment

41:31.658 --> 41:52.215
periods, perhaps a delay in the payment of the 
principal with a continuation of the payment of

41:31.658 --> 41:52.215
the interest, and some kind of an arrangement 
between the international banking system and the

41:31.658 --> 41:52.215
government that will allow the country to 
continue functioning and developing and allow

41:31.658 --> 41:52.215
the banks to continue to carry that debt and feel 
comfortable about eventually collecting it.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.404
when nobody knows and nobody's too anxious to find 
out. Okay, do U.S. executives overseas usually

41:56.946 --> 42:01.051
bring their families with them? Yeah, always. The 
executive that did not bring his family was the

42:02.052 --> 42:06.898
very obvious exception. He was either separated 
or didn't have a family to bring. As a matter of

42:10.583 --> 42:16.551
fact, we at General Motors encouraged our 
executives and almost insisted that they bring

42:10.583 --> 42:16.551
their families. We felt that an executive with his 
family could do a much better job because of the

42:19.769 --> 42:30.781
degree of stability that continuing family life 
provided them as opposed to being concerned about

42:19.769 --> 42:30.781
what mama was doing with the house in Connecticut 
or something. Is there much social mixing with the

42:30.801 --> 42:40.832
local population or do the Americans tend to 
socialize with each other as happens in military

42:30.801 --> 42:40.832
bases quite often? A difficult question to answer 
with just one answer. Some Americans associate

42:44.305 --> 42:50.952
only with Americans and always will because they 
feel comfortable with something that they're

42:44.305 --> 42:50.952
very, very familiar with. But the vast majority of 
them, us, associated with the local population.

42:57.119 --> 43:01.683
Very, very close friends in the Brazilian, 
Argentine, Uruguayan, Chile community, in my

42:57.119 --> 43:01.683
case. We had no problems with the language, liked 
the people, and discovered that that was really

43:03.145 --> 43:12.675
the way that we got a lot more out of the time that we 
spent in the country. so that I would say the vast

43:13.246 --> 43:21.889
majority of Americans really make an effort to get 
out and mix with the local community. So there

43:23.050 --> 43:30.741
isn't any problem in learning the language, or do, 
like in Europe, do most people speak English?

43:31.341 --> 43:43.498
Well, that is a very serious problem, and there I 
blame the United States educational system for

43:31.341 --> 43:43.498
not insisting that everybody learn at least one 
foreign language while he's growing up, because

43:31.341 --> 43:43.498
my experience has been if you learn one, you can 
learn two. But when you've learned a second

43:44.360 --> 43:48.686
language, you can learn a third language very 
easily. If you've never learned any language

43:49.567 --> 43:51.910
except your own, By the age of 40, it's almost 
impossible to learn a foreign language, and it is a

43:52.244 --> 43:56.228
problem. And Americans have much more 
difficulty, in general, now there are very

43:56.389 --> 44:08.923
specific examples to the contrary, but in 
general, have much more difficulty learning a

43:56.389 --> 44:08.923
foreign language than most overseas people or 
foreigners. And it is a problem in doing their jobs

44:10.084 --> 44:15.450
and in making themselves feel at home in a foreign 
country. How many South American countries,

44:17.523 --> 44:22.910
well, many of them have unstable governments. How 
does this affect the lifestyle of Americans

44:22.991 --> 44:26.535
overseas? Well, the degree of instability, 
again, is relative. In Brazil, for example, the

44:30.220 --> 44:34.106
government was very, very stable. The lifestyle 
was totally free, no problems. In 1972, 1973 in

44:37.851 --> 44:42.738
Argentina, the government was totally unstable. 
It was a military government with a very strong

44:42.758 --> 44:47.344
degree of... of terrorism, kidnapping, 
assassinations. The president of Fiat was

44:50.961 --> 44:53.063
assassinated, for example. Three executives, 
one American and two Argentine executives of the

44:55.445 --> 45:01.210
Ford Motor Company were assassinated. It puts a 
lot of pressure on family life. You become a lot

45:03.453 --> 45:04.874
more careful. You live under constant security. 
And it's a very, very nervous and trying times. But

45:12.101 --> 45:16.605
I think most of the families that I knew came 
through stronger than ever before as a result of

45:16.973 --> 45:19.877
their experiences. Once you came through it, it 
was something that you could point to with pride

45:19.937 --> 45:25.163
for the rest of your life. I've met people from 
those times since, and they're very, very proud of

45:25.244 --> 45:31.512
what happened to them there. Okay.

45:34.756 --> 45:41.344
Is terrorism or protest generally directed at the 
plant or company as a whole or at individual

45:34.756 --> 45:41.344
Americans?
