WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:08.109
One of the strong supporters of the Colonel's 
Revolt. Not so much the Colonel's Revolt, but of

00:08.129 --> 00:12.434
what we were trying to do. The objective, which was 
to build an army instead of allowing it to be

00:12.474 --> 00:18.642
destroyed. Well, General Gavin, James M. Gavin, 
who was Chief of Research and Development and

00:19.343 --> 00:32.198
later Chief of Army Operations and Plans, And I was 
very close to General Gavin. I think he was a

00:38.607 --> 00:40.428
wonderful man. You know, he was a major general 
when he was about 30 years old, 31 years old.

00:45.573 --> 00:49.537
Commanded 82nd Division, I guess, 82nd Airborne. 
He was one of the early airborne types. I was

00:54.682 --> 01:01.408
involved in Fort Benning in the early days and 
glider training on the 4X5 type. I was in the second

01:03.886 --> 01:16.742
armored division and didn't go to that side of the 
thing because this armored thing was so

01:03.886 --> 01:16.742
fascinating to me, the mechanization. As you 
know, our armored divisions were patterned after

01:18.104 --> 01:22.870
the German Panzer divisions. The first that we had 
in our country, the first and the second.

01:30.498 --> 01:41.754
Mr. Wilson finally cut him off from the press, cut 
him off from visiting Congress, cut him off from

01:30.498 --> 01:41.754
answering letters to the Congress, and that sort 
of thing. And all the letters that came to him from

01:42.916 --> 01:54.092
the Congress where we were mustering support to 
get an army, to build an army of the future. He was

01:54.325 --> 02:06.240
not permitted to answer, and I would go by each 
morning and pick up his letters and answer them

01:54.325 --> 02:06.240
myself, show him the answers, and sign them off 
myself back to the Congress. So that was a way

02:06.260 --> 02:16.193
around him violating an edict from the White House 
through the Secretary of Defense.

02:20.659 --> 02:23.843
We had a— What specifics? What specific proposals 
did you put forth to the congressman?

02:31.065 --> 02:32.687
We know what Wilson's trying to do. He's trying to 
cut the size of conventional forces and build a

02:33.187 --> 02:39.074
nuclear force and the so-called more bang for the 
buck idea. One specific one was Jupiter C.

02:39.094 --> 02:46.803
Missile. I wanted, and General Gavin wanted to go 
ahead and fire in September the 26th

02:56.746 --> 03:06.656
1956,

02:56.746 --> 03:06.656
and to place in orbit a satellite.

03:11.260 --> 03:14.523
And we were ready to do it, had the capability to do 
it. We'd had some failures with the Navy Vanguard

03:15.324 --> 03:25.774
system, but Jupiter C, which later was Redstone 
Missile, We had a major general, Maderas, down

03:27.661 --> 03:33.026
there, a real sharp ordnance major general. And we 
know where we were going. We needed about $10

03:36.650 --> 03:40.193
million in order to launch.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.283
Eisenhower and Wilson turned us down. We got the 
money in the program. They wouldn't spend it.

04:02.626 --> 04:31.857
next year following the Sputnik was fired and made 
us look like a bunch of asses and uh so this is you

04:02.626 --> 04:31.857
must have got the money after Sputnik oh yes got it 
then sure but you see what you see what I'm talking

04:02.626 --> 04:31.857
about and I'd like history to know this and and uh 
another thing uh they uh Wilson and Eisenhower

04:02.626 --> 04:31.857
turned down us having tactical nuclear weapons 
along with Admiral Radford the chairman of the

04:32.495 --> 04:40.425
Joint Chiefs. So Senator Scoop Jackson who is a 
magnificent individual and a knowing man and who

04:42.428 --> 05:01.472
believes in the defense of the free world in the 
United States he was chairman of the Joint he was

04:42.428 --> 05:01.472
chairman of the subcommittee for military 
application on the Joint Committee on Atomic

05:01.705 --> 05:09.553
Energy. It was a joint committee in those days 
between the House and the Senate. Chet Holifield

05:15.279 --> 05:19.182
was the chairman, as I recall. And this is going 
back some 30 years, you know, almost. And...

05:29.127 --> 05:35.837
Senator Jackson was chairman of the military 
application subcommittee. General Gavin sent me

05:37.780 --> 05:51.520
over and said, we cannot get Radford or the 
president or Wilson to prove off on these

05:37.780 --> 05:51.520
artillery projectiles, 155 and 8-inch. They just 
won't do it. With tactical nuclear weapons. He

05:57.912 --> 05:59.274
said, what can you do? I said, well, let's get it 
done. So I go over and I talk to important members of

06:04.162 --> 06:22.168
the House Armed Services, Senate Armed Services, 
and in a matter of a few days,

06:04.162 --> 06:22.168
we get a request from Senator Jackson to brief him 
on our requirements, and we go. General Gavin and I

06:28.447 --> 06:36.740
and one other nuclear specialist in the operating 
business. And we get that approved over the heads

06:36.760 --> 06:44.292
of the President and the Secretary of Defense and 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. That was a part at

06:46.010 --> 06:54.782
that time of the whole thing of trying to save an 
army and make it viable and capable of defending

06:46.010 --> 06:54.782
this country. Give me another specific. Was the 
airborne part of it another specific? Another one

06:58.507 --> 07:00.710
was helicopters. Another one was tactical 
fighters. Another one was tactical airlift. All

07:08.681 --> 07:09.322
of those.

07:13.368 --> 07:15.190
Better munitions. Which ones did you succeed on, 
and which ones couldn't you get through Congress?

07:27.091 --> 07:28.813
I guess we eventually got them all. Eventually got 
them all. The Colonel's Revolt, then, was a heavy

07:32.517 --> 07:38.562
lobbying effort behind the administration. 
Both. Within the public, within the industry, and

07:40.004 --> 07:44.468
within the Congress. Okay, we talked a little bit 
about Congress. How about industry? What did you

07:51.352 --> 07:52.674
do as far as that? Industry? We had General Motors 
and other corporations that were deeply involved

07:54.216 --> 08:11.282
in lightening up equipment and making 
helicopters, looking at helicopter capability.

08:12.207 --> 08:32.367
We'd had some experience with helicopters in 
Korea

08:12.207 --> 08:32.367
and we were looking at larger units other than just 
a helicopter company and

08:12.207 --> 08:32.367
lighter weight weapons. The M-16 was one.

08:39.173 --> 09:08.792
lightweight machine gun was one of them

08:39.173 --> 09:08.792
a airborne artillery we already had but new 
projectiles like ICM improved conventional

08:39.173 --> 09:08.792
munitions little things everybody's 
complaining about over in Israel right here

08:39.173 --> 09:08.792
there's one right there you put 500 of those in a 
cluster bomblet that's a That's a bomblet right

09:08.975 --> 09:10.517
there. Now look at the other end of it and you'll see 
it's a shaped charge. So that's the improved

09:14.200 --> 09:17.323
conventional munition. We say dual purpose. 
That'll burn a hole through the top of a

09:19.766 --> 09:23.649
lightweight vehicle. It'll also hit the ground 
and explode and throw fragments for 30 meters. And

09:31.297 --> 09:37.463
when you get a canister of 500 of those dumped in a 
about six football fields that don't let many

09:38.033 --> 09:42.740
people get away, you see. So that's a cluster bomb 
like CBU, that was one of the ideas we had. We have

09:48.368 --> 09:52.314
that in the artillery projectile now. There's 
some more than a couple hundred in the eight inch

09:52.374 --> 10:03.209
and there's something less than a hundred in the 
155 round. That's the new munition, it's very

10:03.550 --> 10:07.095
effective for us. But you understand the 
shape-charge effect? No. You see this? You see

10:15.409 --> 10:16.170
this? The explosive is... This is all explosive, 
but it's a shape-charge. This fuse starts it

10:24.202 --> 10:31.192
burning from the back end of that place there, you 
see? And it fires a hot... This... cone shape here

10:37.282 --> 11:04.757
reverse cone here that hits that like that this 
little fuse in here starts this burning and it puts

10:37.282 --> 11:04.757
out a a 900

10:37.282 --> 11:04.757
degree centigrade or more

10:37.282 --> 11:04.757
uh stream of fire that burns a hole through this 
light armor here about the size of my finger. But on

11:11.820 --> 11:23.732
the other side, the spalling will be an area about 
this big of hot molten metal that destroys

11:11.820 --> 11:23.732
personnel inside the vehicle. But that's what we 
call a shaped charge, where the fire starting here

11:24.412 --> 11:33.821
and the intensity starts back here. This causes a 
sharp burning flame of about the size of my little

11:36.057 --> 11:47.956
finger here to concentrate on that particular 
point, burning a hole through and causing

11:36.057 --> 11:47.956
spalling on the inside. So basically the cluster 
bomb then can go, the first thing it does is

11:47.976 --> 11:53.644
penetrate into the vehicle. Into a light, 
thin-skinned vehicle, a light armored vehicle.

11:58.152 --> 12:01.076
Into a light, like a personnel carrier or 
something like that? And then once it gets inside

12:01.096 --> 12:03.600
it has, Well, what it does is molten metal from that 
is burned away. Now, it will also hit the ground and

12:11.431 --> 12:18.620
explode. It has an explosive effect also.

12:25.489 --> 12:26.410
Fragments. This fragment is from here. This 
breaks away as fragmentation. That cone there

12:37.810 --> 12:40.953
burns through things. I see. So that's dual 
purpose. Dual purpose. We call it DPICM, Improved

12:43.516 --> 12:50.323
Conventional Munition. We used it in Vietnam. 
Yeah, I know we used the clusters in Vietnam.

12:57.051 --> 12:59.153
Another one we were after was... Fuel

12:59.622 --> 13:25.765
bombs, let's see if I can give you, CBU-55 was a fuel 
bomb of three canisters of 60 pounds each with a

12:59.622 --> 13:25.765
small parachute on it. has a delayed fuse it hits 
the ground explodes allows out this say propane

13:27.685 --> 13:56.595
and uh with a delayed fuse this being gas being 
heavier and airy it goes down in the holes and in the

13:27.685 --> 13:56.595
tunnels and then explodes a tremendous weapon 
it'll clear each one of those 60 pound canisters

13:27.685 --> 13:56.595
will clear uh maybe uh fifty meter diameter of all 
the brush and everything else, plus kills

13:57.537 --> 14:06.736
everything down in the holes in that area in which 
it was. It's the only system we have that really

14:06.796 --> 14:13.831
will get down in a hole or a cave and get a fella out. 
Were they used in Vietnam? Yes. I think they would

14:18.631 --> 14:19.992
have been useful there. Well, they were very, very 
useful, and Mr. Carter cut them out and wouldn't

14:20.333 --> 14:27.499
let the Israelis have them. I thought the Israelis 
ought to go ahead and make them themselves.

14:30.782 --> 14:34.266
They're not that difficult to make. Now let's talk 
a little bit about how you manipulated industry,

14:34.286 --> 14:43.434
Congress, and other people. Did you have sort of a 
public relations campaign? One fellow was

14:47.639 --> 14:51.004
responsible with the press. Oh, really? One of the 
colonels? Yes. One of them carried the press and

14:55.231 --> 15:08.132
leaked to them information that was counter to the 
big bang for the buck. Yeah, counter to the

15:08.152 --> 15:10.195
administration's view. In other words, the 
administration is— is destroying the

15:14.251 --> 15:20.639
conventional capability of our armed forces.

15:22.641 --> 15:37.980
Apparently little consideration being given to 
the fact that conventional wars of limited types

15:22.641 --> 15:37.980
and for limited duration which impact on our 
national security cannot be dealt with this

15:38.804 --> 15:53.203
philosophy and this sort of strategy and 
therefore Congress and the American people ought

15:38.804 --> 15:53.203
to know the truth on what's happening and that sort 
of stuff and that continuous approach in that

15:38.804 --> 15:53.203
direction. And

15:53.243 --> 16:06.820
we had a top secret document somehow got leaked out 
by

15:53.243 --> 16:06.820
a colonel that was responsible for that aspect of 
it.

16:15.136 --> 16:16.598
What did that document deal with? What was the 
basic topic? I think it dealt primarily with the

16:20.662 --> 16:31.754
organization of the five colonels

16:20.662 --> 16:31.754
and then it hit the press. About the same time

16:38.558 --> 16:54.623
The authorization

16:38.558 --> 16:54.623
bill had,

16:38.558 --> 16:54.623
was being debated on the floor, which was 
tremendously different from that in which the

16:38.558 --> 16:54.623
administration had submitted. Mr. Eisenhower 
said root out the, those people that asked Wilson

16:56.666 --> 17:06.000
to investigate and find out who they are, and 
Wilson said there's a bunch of eager beavers

17:06.233 --> 17:15.021
gnawing on the wrong tree.

17:18.784 --> 17:29.293
And, uh, I had a little fire, I guess, in the 
Pentagon, and that took care of that. We were all

17:29.313 --> 17:30.694
investigated. That took care of the documents. 
Yeah, it took care of all the documents. We were

17:34.337 --> 17:35.498
investigated. by direction of Mr. Wilson.

17:43.863 --> 17:55.674
I had already been selected for the Army War 
College

17:43.863 --> 17:55.674
and that list was out.

17:55.694 --> 18:06.143
There was a reconsideration of the whole list and 
as I recall one colonel went to command and all the

17:55.694 --> 18:06.143
others went to war colleges, either the National 
War College or the Army War College.

18:11.086 --> 18:13.548
Investigations continued while we were there. I 
was accused of passing top secret documents to the

18:13.588 --> 18:33.750
Congress and the investigator that investigated 
me, I

18:13.588 --> 18:33.750
thought he was kind of a foolish chap. He was doing 
his job, He thought that it was really bad that I was

18:38.185 --> 18:45.956
passing top secret documents to the Congress. 
Well, did you admit that? Oh yes, I admitted it. I

18:49.020 --> 18:51.243
said, oh yes, I certainly did. He said, well, who'd 
you send them to? I said, members of the Senate

18:53.025 --> 19:05.863
Armed Services Committee, House Armed Services 
Committee, Senate Appropriations Committee,

18:53.025 --> 19:05.863
House Appropriations Committee, senate foreign 
relations committee house foreign affairs

19:06.738 --> 19:35.074
committee and i said all of those people are 
cleared for top secret and even security

19:06.738 --> 19:35.074
clearance is higher than yours colonel and i said 
let's be sure that we get this on the record here and

19:06.738 --> 19:35.074
i'm surprised that you didn't know or whoever put 
you up to this didn't know that members of congress

19:06.738 --> 19:35.074
many of them carry them higher security 
clearances and than some members of the Armed

19:35.611 --> 19:38.876
Forces. I got off a clean bill of health. My friend 
who was also at the Army War College with me, who's

19:44.705 --> 20:01.011
not living now, Don Ewell, Y-U-E-L-L, class of 39 
from West Point, was the only one as far as I know

20:03.421 --> 20:16.443
that received any punishment at all and his was 
administrative reprimand because he's the one

20:03.421 --> 20:16.443
that the top secret document accidentally got 
away from. To the press? To the press,

20:17.965 --> 20:22.513
yeah. So that ended a story in my life except while 
at the War College I continued to fight for and made

20:31.940 --> 20:44.457
speech after speech on the floor to all the 
students about the pentamic division, which was a

20:31.940 --> 20:44.457
destruction of our army capability. I continue to 
do that.

20:49.844 --> 20:59.938
And

20:49.844 --> 20:59.938
I've continued to work toward what we need, and I'm 
doing it right today. I guess I'll always. So you

21:03.111 --> 21:06.795
said that before that you were close here to a 
court-martial. Is that as close as you came?

21:08.657 --> 21:10.219
That's as close as I ever came. Ms. Hollingsworth 
thought that her objective in life, I think, was to

21:10.820 --> 21:25.157
do whatever she could to prevent me from being 
another Billy Mitchell. And that never entered my

21:25.177 --> 21:27.259
mind. It never entered my mind that I was going to be 
court-martialed for what I was doing, because I

21:29.669 --> 21:39.746
believed in what I was doing. I believed in the 
Army, I believed in our country, and I'm honest.

21:47.319 --> 21:55.153
And if you're honest,

21:47.319 --> 21:55.153
you don't have to, and you speak the truth, from 
what you know to be the truth, and you speak not

21:56.264 --> 22:04.757
otherwise, then you never have to worry about 
tomorrow. You don't have to worry about what you

22:05.518 --> 22:07.642
said today. You never have to do that. You don't 
have to have a long memory. Yes, but honesty is one

22:11.908 --> 22:16.135
thing, and politics is something entirely 
different at times. That's true. And you're

22:17.297 --> 22:20.702
dealing now, and not in the military sphere— but 
you're dealing in a political sphere and the

22:21.509 --> 22:30.718
politicians also think that they're honest, they 
just have a different view of the world in this

22:21.509 --> 22:30.718
particular case. So weren't you ever fearful that 
the politicians, the president, the secretary of

22:31.919 --> 22:49.255
defense, your civilian authorities, weren't you 
fearful that you were going to jeopardize your

22:31.919 --> 22:49.255
career because you were taking an opposite view 
and taking it so stridently?

22:53.774 --> 23:05.852
I

22:53.774 --> 23:05.852
guess I didn't give that very much consideration 
as I look back on it. I still had a great belief in man

23:07.935 --> 23:17.710
regardless of whether he was a politician or 
whether he was a commoner on a day laborer or a dock

23:07.935 --> 23:17.710
worker. I had a great belief in God and that he had 
made a determination somewhere along the line

23:22.462 --> 23:49.819
that I'd do certain things and I had witnessed his 
protection of me and safeguarding of me in some

23:22.462 --> 23:49.819
very serious conflict and battle

23:22.462 --> 23:49.819
and some very serious warnings that he had given me 
in which I accepted and which I would never have

23:22.462 --> 23:49.819
been here if I had not If he had not signaled me to 
certain dangers, I'm talking about the great

23:50.828 --> 24:00.141
master of all of us. So I'm a real strong believer, 
and when I believe in what I'm trying to do, I've

24:00.161 --> 24:16.583
never allowed anything to interfere with it 
because I always trust in him signaling me and

24:00.161 --> 24:16.583
pulling me out before I step over the side of the 
mountain. Obviously some of your superiors

24:16.900 --> 24:24.530
thought you were doing the right thing and 
supported you, otherwise you wouldn't have been

24:16.900 --> 24:24.530
promoted at that time to full colonel. That's 
right, sir. That's true. Very true. And how can you

24:28.515 --> 24:31.299
account for being promoted? I mean obviously you 
have an outstanding record, but you're in a

24:31.399 --> 24:39.610
situation here which might be damaging to your 
career. Who do you think it was that wanted you to

24:40.731 --> 24:45.237
become a, get a promotion? Well, I think General 
Ridgway, and I think General Taylor. In fact, when

24:51.048 --> 25:16.371
I left to go to War College, I went in to see General 
Taylor to tell him goodbye, and he said to me, he

24:51.048 --> 25:16.371
said, you've had some trying times, and said you

24:51.048 --> 25:16.371
have done an outstanding job, and I want you to take 
this photograph here, that I've autographed for

25:17.735 --> 25:30.593
you and he said, I just want you to know that

25:17.735 --> 25:30.593
I would never make you a general officer unless 
you've done what you've done.

25:33.678 --> 25:34.539
That's what he said.

25:37.683 --> 25:43.692
And I thought to myself, that's a hell of a 
compliment from a hell of a great man.

25:49.173 --> 26:04.205
So, I went off to War College and continued

25:49.173 --> 26:04.205
to be controversial there amongst the students, 
but a leader amongst the students.

26:07.031 --> 26:10.017
We had committees where you study to build a 
national strategy. That was very helpful to me in

26:15.338 --> 26:30.100
building a new strategy in Korea, a new strategy in 
Pakistan, and also for him, and also for working

26:15.338 --> 26:30.100
certain programs when I was Deputy Secretary of 
Defense. Two-track system in high school, I

26:31.101 --> 26:37.050
worked with HEW on that. The two-year trade 
schools in South Carolina have been a great

26:37.925 --> 26:45.917
supporter of that.

26:48.381 --> 26:54.271
You've got to understand that some people are 
suited for academics, but most of us are not. I

26:55.953 --> 27:06.109
think maybe, generally speaking, we've had too 
damn many people go to college and not enough learn

26:55.953 --> 27:06.109
the trade.

27:06.832 --> 27:11.219
We got a lot of people with PhDs but not of our 
experience. The

27:11.279 --> 27:32.012
Vietnam conflict fostered a hide from the war by 
going to get a baccalaureate degree and graduate

27:11.279 --> 27:32.012
in June and start in September on a master's degree 
and when you finish that one go the next year to a PhD

27:11.279 --> 27:32.012
and you In my view, that sort of thing has not 
contributed one goddamn thing to our society. And

27:39.923 --> 27:48.515
that's the reason why I find some PhDs today out 
working as day laborers and can't get a job. And my

27:49.717 --> 27:58.489
view of education is that you get a, if you're 
academically inclined to make a contribution to

27:49.717 --> 27:58.489
our society, you get a baccalaureate degree and 
then you go get some experience in that and find out

27:59.566 --> 28:23.548
where is it you can best make a contribution and 
then go back and get a higher degree in the area in

27:59.566 --> 28:23.548
which you like and you can make a contribution and 
then after you've gone out and had a look at that and

27:59.566 --> 28:23.548
made some mistakes and said well I made a mistake 
here or there but here's where I can do then you can

28:23.798 --> 28:31.347
go ahead after experience and become a Ph.D. and 
really make a contribution to our country. And if

28:31.547 --> 28:37.875
you can't, then God damn it, you haven't done 
anything but fool yourself and the American

28:31.547 --> 28:37.875
people. You see? I got funny ideas about this, but 
that's the way it is. I don't think it's the damn

28:45.423 --> 28:46.725
funny. So you were a leader there at the War 
College. Oh, yeah. I had... Many committees. I

28:53.384 --> 28:54.806
chaired many committees.

28:57.830 --> 29:17.653
One committee was, I chaired a committee to study 
the Iranian, Turkestan, Tashkent, Armenian,

28:57.830 --> 29:17.653
Black Sea area, Gaspain Sea area, that part of the 
world. As a matter of fact,

29:23.401 --> 29:33.011
For six weeks I was a red army commander, a field 
marshal of the total red army to take the

29:23.401 --> 29:33.011
Mediterranean.

29:35.254 --> 29:37.736
And opposing forces was another fellow.

29:40.660 --> 29:46.826
And you had to play it as it is today with the top 
secret intelligence of both sides.

29:51.191 --> 29:53.273
And I beat the hell out of Americans.

29:57.843 --> 30:12.036
And then,

29:57.843 --> 30:12.036
for six weeks, I became the American commander to 
come up with what is needed in order to avoid that.

30:14.158 --> 30:27.090
Then that becomes a part of a kind of a detailed, 
worked out,

30:14.158 --> 30:27.090
colonel level Air Force, Army, Navy students who 
are there. strategy for defense

30:28.893 --> 30:37.822
of the Persian Gulf against the Soviets.

30:42.407 --> 30:48.513
Because of your interest in that area, is that why 
they sent you to Pakistan right after your

30:42.407 --> 30:48.513
completion of the course? I think so, I think so. So 
from 1957 then until 1959 you were the chief of the

30:50.715 --> 30:56.301
U.S. Army. element of the MAG group in Pakistan. 
Now, of course at this time, India is having

31:02.279 --> 31:07.828
problems with Pakistan. Right. We were trying to 
play a balancing act here, weren't we, as far as our

31:09.772 --> 31:15.361
policy is concerned? Yes. That must have put you in 
a pretty tough spot. Put me in a hell of a tough spot.

31:19.889 --> 31:21.732
As a matter of fact, To answer General Iyub's 
question, who was a commander-in-chief and lived

31:22.960 --> 31:34.759
at Rawalpindi, and I lived in the same general 
area, maybe half a mile away. What was his name?

31:36.722 --> 31:40.227
Iyub Khan, A-Y-U-B-K-H-A-N. He was a general, 
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, later

31:40.848 --> 31:44.574
president. And I got deeply involved in that, his 
becoming president. while I was there. He became

31:52.977 --> 31:55.480
president, yes, I will tell you.

31:58.583 --> 32:11.097
But my mission was one of training about five or six 
divisions of the Pakistani Army and equipping

31:58.583 --> 32:11.097
those with American equipment.

32:14.641 --> 32:18.786
And some of the questions that you encountered 
from General Iyub later President Iyub was how can

32:19.272 --> 32:45.519
you

32:19.272 --> 32:45.519
deny me the use

32:19.272 --> 32:45.519
of your military aid equipment in the Azad Kashmir 
border area where we have a United Nations

32:19.272 --> 32:45.519
ceasefire team between the Indians. How can you 
deny me the use of your aid equipment up there

32:49.782 --> 33:11.875
machine guns rifles mortars tanks trucks and that 
sort of thing while at the same time you give the

32:49.782 --> 33:11.875
Indians 300 million grant aid and they go by 
106-millimeter recoilless rifles from you and

33:13.238 --> 33:23.754
Jaguar fighter planes from the British and bring 
them up here and use them against me.

33:28.862 --> 33:34.631
And said, you've been up there, and I'll point them 
out to you, your U.S. equipment.

33:38.757 --> 33:40.039
I said, General, are you...

33:42.753 --> 33:46.739
I'm a military man and a soldier, as you are.

33:51.806 --> 33:54.590
I said, I can't answer that question. I said, 
that's a question that should be asked by your

33:55.892 --> 34:04.364
prime minister of our president.

34:07.468 --> 34:11.494
He said, they're politicians and they won't ask 
each other questions like that.

34:17.600 --> 34:22.528
And he said, that's what's wrong with, and that's 
what's part of the problem here in this country.

34:26.935 --> 34:45.885
He said, your government gives my government 
wheat, and there's

34:26.935 --> 34:45.885
ship load after ship load of wheat stacked in the 
harbor, rotting in Karachi, and my government

34:26.935 --> 34:45.885
doesn't have sense enough or the capability to get 
the weed out to our tribal people and the villagers

34:46.709 --> 34:54.057
here who have sore bellies because they're not 
getting enough to eat. Yet the weed is rotting down

34:55.578 --> 35:00.523
there.

35:00.543 --> 35:02.666
And he said, why does your government do that? Why 
does your government gloat over what support

35:05.248 --> 35:15.619
you're giving us here beyond our capability to 
even manage? and you deny me in an area where I need

35:17.135 --> 35:24.625
things, military, you've limited me to very 
little. Said, are you, said, we have declared

35:26.427 --> 35:35.019
ourselves as friends of the United States, but are 
you really my friend? We're your friend, but are

35:36.080 --> 35:38.844
you really my friend? Because here's what you're 
doing to us. Those questions are very difficult,

35:43.069 --> 35:45.893
very hard to, to explain and you put your American 
foreign policies, put honest people out at the

35:47.003 --> 36:05.101
colonel and general level in a hell of a position.

36:09.566 --> 36:15.492
So

36:09.566 --> 36:15.492
you get on with

36:18.644 --> 36:23.092
or trying to support your government, or you quit 
and get out. So, I think most of the military feels

36:24.354 --> 36:32.387
that they've got something to contribute. Kind of 
swallow hard and go ahead and do the best they can

36:32.407 --> 36:42.745
under the circumstances.

36:48.817 --> 36:52.221
Did you bring the Pakistani divisions? Did you 
bring them up to par? I brought the Pakistani

36:54.284 --> 37:17.895
divisions up to par except in one area, which is a 
crucial area in that part of the world amongst all

36:54.284 --> 37:17.895
of the peoples in the Middle East, including all 
the Arab nations, including the Iranians,

36:54.284 --> 37:17.895
Pakistanis, most all of the people in that area. of 
the world. And that is that they do not understand

37:21.579 --> 37:46.463
this business of logistics support

37:21.579 --> 37:46.463
and the management of the things that's necessary 
in order to keep a fighting force in being and

37:21.579 --> 37:46.463
sustainable during combat. And that's 
ammunition and this was brought out very clearly

37:48.824 --> 38:18.477
against a war which occurred after I left there 
where in the Brits I mean where in the Indians and

37:48.824 --> 38:18.477
Pakistan went at it

37:48.824 --> 38:18.477
over Kashmir area and Pakistani tank battalions 
were just eating up the Indians driving them back

38:20.785 --> 38:29.836
until they ran out of fuel and ran out of 
ammunition, at which point in time they got out of

38:20.785 --> 38:29.836
their tanks, left them, and walked back. They

38:30.377 --> 38:46.036
cited recorded instances of

38:30.377 --> 38:46.036
that. Those soldiers came out of the villages 
ninety percent of them out of the villages.

38:56.173 --> 39:02.042
We're in, they've been there eighteen years with a 
wooden plow and bullocks.

39:06.088 --> 39:09.013
There's not much logistic support there for that. 
And you don't change people overnight. Okay? Now

39:14.441 --> 39:19.108
tell me about the episode of helping the general 
and your role in that. After I'd been there some

39:19.358 --> 39:27.113
time, well, I hadn't been there very long until I 
gained his confidence and he certainly gained

39:19.358 --> 39:27.113
mine. I thought he was one of the most magnificent 
men I had ever met in my life. Why do you say that?

39:35.229 --> 39:37.133
Well, he was the most balanced man. He was a British 
sand hearse trained officer. He commanded, he was

39:42.089 --> 39:52.925
the first commander of a British battalion during 
World War II in India. Normally British units,

39:53.846 --> 39:59.254
those commands are all Brit officers second in 
command is an Indian, or a Pakistani, or a Gurkha,

39:59.842 --> 40:19.751
or whoever it might be, Ethiopia, an Egyptian, 
something like that, but all those commands,

39:59.842 --> 40:19.751
that's the Brits, they had saved those positions, 
except Iyub, I think, was the first one that really

39:59.842 --> 40:19.751
was a commander of a battalion. And he's just one 
brilliant man, and was commander in chief, and had

40:30.183 --> 40:32.065
a great personality. He loved to shoot, loved to 
hunt, and the hunting was great in the Himalayas,

40:32.946 --> 40:39.292
bird shooting. He

40:41.214 --> 40:49.563
was a good horseman, although he didn't play polo, 
he was a good horseman. He wanted me to play golf

40:50.564 --> 40:53.466
with him, which I did. We'd go shooting together, 
Miss Hollingsworth and Begum Ayoub, who was still

41:01.267 --> 41:06.914
in Perda, but Mrs. Ayoub and Mrs. Hollingsworth. 
And the daughters were very close to Mrs.

41:07.475 --> 41:12.020
Hollingsworth. I went by to visit the daughter and 
the son-in-law. The son-in-law was a Wally of

41:16.266 --> 41:20.671
Swat, the governor of Swat State. And so, we were 
kind of a close family. And Ayoub's son knew He was

41:30.511 --> 41:35.196
in the military and we were very close as a matter of 
fact. He called one day, an aide called one day. We

41:40.322 --> 41:48.110
worked from 7 o'clock in the morning until 12 
o'clock and the temperatures were such that you

41:40.322 --> 41:48.110
stayed in the rest of the day.

41:51.374 --> 41:58.061
I went about other things where you were not 
subject to the stress and the heat. None of the

41:58.081 --> 42:00.163
facilities were air conditioned were they? No, 
none.

42:04.453 --> 42:21.014
I had a call about one o'clock, and it was General 
Ayoub's aide, and he said, General Ayoub would

42:04.453 --> 42:21.014
like to speak to you, and I said, yes sir. He said, 
Holly, he said, I didn't get a chance to see you this

42:22.876 --> 42:29.745
morning, he said. Could I come over now?" And I 
said, yes, sir, General, you please do. I'm here at

42:37.881 --> 42:38.642
home. On the veranda, Miss Hollingsworth and Mrs. 
O'Brien, Captain O'Brien's wife was one of my

42:40.865 --> 42:51.077
ordnance officers out of my team of about 12 
officers.

42:54.080 --> 43:00.508
We're sitting on the veranda and our chocodile who 
was a guard, opened the gate and in came the big

43:00.758 --> 43:23.425
black Cadillac limousine and General Ayoub got 
out and greeted the ladies and myself and I knew he

43:00.758 --> 43:23.425
wanted to see me so I said, well, General Ayoub, 
since I didn't get a chance to see you this morning,

43:24.434 --> 43:33.146
Maybe we could excuse ourselves and present the 
ladies here and go back to one of the drawing rooms,

43:24.434 --> 43:33.146
of which there was three in my quarters. He said, oh 
yes, I'd love to. I'd love to do that. So we go back. I

43:40.637 --> 43:42.099
said, sir, it's two o'clock. Would you like a 
whiskey? He said, yes, I believe I would. So we had a

43:47.026 --> 43:47.967
whiskey. It was scotch with water and no ice. 
British style. So the bear came in, and Ibram was a

43:55.467 --> 44:01.837
bear. He brought in a drink, and he said, well, 
said, Holly, I might as well get on with it. I said,

44:11.993 --> 44:12.594
yes, sir. He said, did you ever think about taking 
over a country?

44:21.688 --> 44:23.230
I said, uh, No, sir, not really, but I said I've 
studied all the principles involved and

44:23.733 --> 44:38.716
it's been applied by other governments and 
throughout a large share of history.

44:45.045 --> 44:49.993
And I know key principles that's involved in 
taking over the country and what you have to do.

44:54.530 --> 45:21.195
He said, well,

44:54.530 --> 45:21.195
my government

44:54.530 --> 45:21.195
is trying to run an advanced state of democracy

44:54.530 --> 45:21.195
in order to satisfy your foreign policy 
requirements so we can get aid for our people.
