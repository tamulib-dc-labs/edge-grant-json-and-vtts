This is a test. Today's interview, April 1, 1980, 
is with Dr. Patton Burns, retired professor of

00:04.679 --> 00:26.570
veterinary medicine and former head of the 
Department of Veterinary Physiology and

00:04.679 --> 00:26.570
Pharmacology, also the author of a little booklet 
entitled Veterinary and Medicine at Texas A&M,

00:04.679 --> 00:26.570
1958 to 1978. There we go. Okay, it's working. 
Today's interview, April 1st, 1980, is with Dr.

00:33.431 --> 00:51.733
Patton Burns, retired professor of veterinary 
medicine, former head of the Department of Vet

00:33.431 --> 00:51.733
Physiology and Pharmacology, and author of this 
fine little book, Veterinary Medicine at Texas

00:33.431 --> 00:51.733
A&M 1958 to 1975.

00:54.015 --> 00:55.657
Let's talk about your background first. You're a 
native Texan. Yes. You tell me when you were born. I

01:00.983 --> 01:06.051
was born in Cuero, Texas, October 16, 1901. Can you 
tell me about your early life, about your parents?

01:10.517 --> 01:20.011
Well, we lived several miles, about four miles 
north of Cuero on the Cuero-Yoakum Road in DeWitt

01:10.517 --> 01:20.011
County. And I grew up there. I went to school in 
Cuero for 11 years. Of course, we didn't have the

01:26.140 --> 01:28.003
12th grade then. And I graduated there in 1919. 
Came here as a freshman in September. And other

01:36.328 --> 01:43.657
than about 10 months in Beaumont, I've been here 
ever since, since September 1919. What did your

01:44.999 --> 01:46.360
father do? Did he have a ranch out there? He was a 
farmer, rancher. He was? Cattle? Well, mostly

01:50.946 --> 01:52.929
mules. He was a mule breeder. And he had a bunch of 
mares and a jack. but he bought quite a few mules.

02:02.221 --> 02:07.628
He'd go down the Rio Grande Valley and buy mules, 
and well, any place he could buy them in the state.

02:08.930 --> 02:19.185
But

02:08.930 --> 02:19.185
my brother, two brothers, older brothers, we had 
two of them. One was a physician, the other two were

02:20.507 --> 02:27.437
stockmen and ranchers. If he ever bought some 
horses or cattle in these deals, well, he'd turn

02:29.206 --> 02:34.712
them over to them. But he had some

02:36.353 --> 02:45.763
black cattle, mules. And my brother had some reds. 
And they were always competing with one another. I

02:52.390 --> 02:56.935
think they just kept them as hobbies.

03:00.087 --> 03:05.313
But mostly, I'd say 75% farming and 25% ranching. 
Well, I knew him. He had ranched before then.

03:14.625 --> 03:22.775
Oh, by the time I left in 1919, he was turning out 
quite a bit of the farm into grazing land. So he was

03:23.195 --> 03:24.837
going back to that. What was he growing? Cotton 
mostly. That was a cash crop. A little corn and

03:30.511 --> 03:32.312
maize.

03:34.814 --> 03:37.377
He planted gumes between the corn rows. He was the 
first one in the county to build any terraces. He

03:42.481 --> 03:43.402
came to A&M. These formerly short courses of 
Congress, as they called them then. He'd pick up an

03:49.487 --> 03:54.732
idea here and there, so he decided to terrace.

03:56.602 --> 04:04.814
Then he was the first one to plant legumes between 
the corn rows, and he more than doubled his yield.

04:08.440 --> 04:12.606
But he was a diversified farmer. He liked to do 
both. Why did he go down to Rio Grande for the mules?

04:17.753 --> 04:19.736
Is that the best area in that particular town to buy 
mules? Well, he could buy smaller mules down in

04:19.756 --> 04:24.263
that part of the country. around Final Furious and 
around that area. I believe Hepburnville, below

04:32.209 --> 04:38.597
George West, between that and the border. But they 
were smaller mules. Well, what was the advantage

04:43.904 --> 04:45.927
of having a smaller mule? Well, they sold better in 
that county. These big Missouri mules, you'd very

04:48.530 --> 04:52.576
seldom see those. They were used by contractors 
more. That was before the days of the tractor.

04:59.313 --> 05:04.620
You'd find these big mules on these road 
contractors' work. How many acres are in this

05:05.280 --> 05:08.144
ranch? Oh, around a thousand. Really?

05:14.352 --> 05:22.802
Well, about close to 900 in one, and about 250

05:23.626 --> 05:26.690
mother's old place down between Quora and 
Victoria.

05:31.617 --> 05:35.942
Did he have any help besides two boys, three boys, 
three sons? Well, they were the three sons older

05:36.243 --> 05:42.851
than I were half-brothers. They were two sets of 
children. His first wife died when she was about

05:45.535 --> 05:48.979
35. Then he married Anna Wright from Thomaston, 
that is between Queroa and Victoria. And she had

05:59.813 --> 06:11.607
inherited some property from her on the old side. 
Charles Lockhart was her grandfather. And she had

06:16.613 --> 06:20.177
inherited some from her mother. And the original, 
one of the Stephen F. Austin grants. I

06:27.455 --> 06:32.204
still own my share. Do you really? How much is that? 
Oh, a little over 100 acres. And it goes all the way

06:37.454 --> 06:40.660
back to the Austin grants? Oh, yes. On your 
father's side, too? No on her side, my father's are

06:45.571 --> 06:49.636
more recent. I think my mother's goes back to about 
1820s and the 20s. My father's into the 1830s I

06:54.502 --> 06:58.507
think. So her people were here before his. And your 
father's forefathers came in the 1830s and lived

07:03.253 --> 07:10.903
in that same area ever since? Well, I've got one 
nephew who bought the place, the place that my

07:12.807 --> 07:21.541
father and mother, where we lived, between Cuero 
and Yoakum. And he owns it now. And his father had

07:25.047 --> 07:31.256
some ranching north of there, close to Yoakum. He 
owns that, and also he inherited some from his

07:31.937 --> 07:35.263
mother. So on that Cuero-Yoakum road, he has about 
half of that. land on both sides between those

07:40.398 --> 07:44.361
places. Can you tell me about your upbringing as a 
young man? Well, no, just the usual eleven grades

07:52.008 --> 08:01.976
and

07:52.008 --> 08:01.976
working in the summers on the farm. My father 
employed to take students and I think merely so

08:10.469 --> 08:21.679
they could keep me some company, but he'd usually 
employ larger and stronger ones than I, and I think

08:10.469 --> 08:21.679
with a purpose. I know two football boys, two of 
them went to the University of Texas. One was an

08:25.863 --> 08:28.765
outstanding star at the University of Texas. And 
they

08:30.166 --> 08:39.835
would do it for exercise, for conditioning in the 
summer, work old summer. Some of the boys would

08:40.608 --> 08:50.261
pick six or eight or 10 boys would come out there 
right after holidays, and some of them worked too

08:40.608 --> 08:50.261
fast. Some of them would last till 12 o'clock the 
first day. Some through the first day. Some

08:56.769 --> 09:01.035
checked out one or two the next two or three days. 
Usually end up about three of us left

09:01.055 --> 09:06.642
for the summer. What did he pay them? I think they 
usually go in price a dollar a day. The blacks and

09:11.309 --> 09:16.116
the Mexicans around, they got the same thing. Did 
he hire blacks and Mexicans also? He hired who he

09:21.003 --> 09:22.145
could get? Mexicans mostly.

09:26.991 --> 09:32.880
But when it came to hog killing time, the Negroes 
were there too. How many, did he add hogs in too? Oh

09:35.384 --> 09:39.289
yes, oh yes, we'd kill eight or ten at a time.

09:42.353 --> 09:43.475
That's pretty interesting. Did you ever get any 
time off and when you did, what did you do on your

09:44.055 --> 09:47.200
time off? I didn't know what a vacation was then. I 
spent on the farm to my advantage because I recall

09:52.407 --> 10:04.142
once staying to football and they those 
interested in football practice. I think it was in

10:07.169 --> 10:12.734
eighth or ninth grade, and I stayed for football 
practice and got it home by dark. That was the last

10:14.856 --> 10:15.836
time. He said, who's gonna feed those hogs and milk 
those cows? We were milking seven cows. And he

10:23.543 --> 10:26.586
said, I'm not gonna do all your work for you. He 
said, you help me, but said, who's gonna take care

10:26.606 --> 10:32.111
of those hogs? You can't do some of that work 
Effectively after dark. He said, here you are at

10:36.400 --> 10:38.903
dark before you got home. See, I rode horseback. By 
the time I got home, the sun was down, gone.

10:48.513 --> 10:53.999
He says, it's more important doing this farm work 
than it is playing down on the football field. So

10:54.019 --> 10:55.641
that was the last time I went out. What were your 
favorite subjects in high school? I think math was

11:03.809 --> 11:09.555
my favorite. I had a little more difficulty with 
it, and

11:09.655 --> 11:20.345
I liked history, and it went right through me. And 
easy to come, easy to go. But

11:24.950 --> 11:31.096
I particularly liked Texas history and American 
history. In fact, I had those under Walter P. Webb

11:34.454 --> 11:39.660
by now, or at least that was after he left there. 
Then he went to San Antonio. He stayed in Coro only

11:42.723 --> 11:47.608
about one or two years. His, Buck Shewitz, I'm sure 
you've heard of him, the artist. Buck's father was

11:54.716 --> 11:57.419
chairman of the school board. And he was 
responsible for getting Mr. Webb at that time. And

12:05.082 --> 12:11.189
then he went on to the University of Texas and, of 
course, gained considerably fame. But I

12:12.391 --> 12:21.062
thoroughly enjoyed my experience with him. Oh,

12:21.302 --> 12:29.131
I liked English and manual training. I don't know 
of any subjects I didn't like. Would you consider

12:32.302 --> 12:35.445
yourself a good student in high school? Oh no, I'd 
say ordinary. Getting

12:39.870 --> 12:48.098
back to your father's farm or ranch, was it 
profitable? Well I used to remember him say that he

12:49.920 --> 13:01.532
would

12:49.920 --> 13:01.532
make an outstanding crop once every seven years in 
farming. That's the cycle, and he just enough to

13:05.543 --> 13:17.017
stay in, but I don't remember him having any 
difficulty in helping the renters. They were on

13:17.057 --> 13:23.065
halves, they rented on half and half, and he would 
for the dry goods and the groceries and the drug

13:25.070 --> 13:34.743
bills during the year, and then they would pay him 
back when they got the cotton in the summer. And I

13:35.544 --> 13:42.574
don't know if I remember when he was really in 
difficulty, but what I mean by an outstanding crop

13:35.544 --> 13:42.574
that seventh year. Yeah, yeah. But, yes, I think it 
was profitable. They were always buying up the

13:48.502 --> 13:54.790
land here and there and adjoining the place, 
adding to it. In other words, he had sharecroppers

13:56.018 --> 13:58.441
then? Well, yes. They had the house, but he stood 
for their bills during the year. I remember we all

14:06.591 --> 14:11.577
got a 10% discount. I could go in. He told me one day 
that he was, I met him on the road, and he said, this

14:12.438 --> 14:21.510
is the last day I want to see you wearing a cap. I 
think I was about the sixth grade. He said,

14:25.027 --> 14:33.798
tomorrow you go by, he designated

14:25.027 --> 14:33.798
the store, and get your hat. I think he'd already 
picked out the hat. It was a Stetson. Oh, really?

14:42.490 --> 14:44.733
So I've worn hats ever since. Did they have boots 
for you, too? No, my brother was the one that wore

14:47.116 --> 14:50.640
the boots. The boots were a little too expensive 
for me. But I never saw my brother on a pair of shoes

14:53.562 --> 14:58.669
until we went by. He was 25 years older than I. He was 
the oldest one in the family. My wife and I went by to

15:05.298 --> 15:10.124
see him down in Jim Wells County at Alfred. That's 
between Alice

15:11.566 --> 15:21.139
and George West.

15:23.127 --> 15:27.453
So I said, Tom, what in the world are you doing 
wearing shoes? I said, that's the first pair of

15:27.593 --> 15:30.497
shoes I've ever seen you wear. And he says, hey, 
don't have the shoemaker I used to have, Mr. H.

15:32.199 --> 15:41.512
Boney. And he and his son both got boots. And as long 
as he lived, they got boots there.

15:50.482 --> 15:55.010
But he says they can't fit me anymore, and he was 
very particular. But I remember as a child, about

15:56.894 --> 16:10.298
three years old, I went out in the old manger there, 
and a pair of his boots, a hard, had been sewn away.

16:10.358 --> 16:13.063
After they got in the mud, they were about worn out. 
They were hard from being wet and mud, but I had to

16:14.782 --> 16:20.509
put them on. And I put one of them on, and there were 
three stinging scorpions in the bottom of that.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.279
And I couldn't get the things off. And I stomped, 
and I couldn't kill them. So a Negro woman came and

16:31.783 --> 16:36.789
finally got my foot out. But that was my own. Were 
you sick? No. Really? It didn't really bother me

16:42.376 --> 16:43.577
much. No kidding. Not nearly as bad as a red ant. Oh, 
yeah. Sit down on one of those hills.

16:55.392 --> 16:57.634
Tell me about the renters. How many did you have, 
and could you tell me something about the system

16:57.915 --> 17:04.701
that your father had with these renters? Oh, I 
recall six or seven Mexican houses that they had on

17:07.224 --> 17:12.869
the place. I have to say

17:17.067 --> 17:23.576
He figured around 40 acres to a man, but frequently 
the wives and the children did a lot of work. Some of

17:23.616 --> 17:29.604
them would farm 80 acres and some 120 acres. 
Depends on the size of the families.

17:40.996 --> 17:45.623
Let's see, one, two, three, one, three of them in a 
row, three, four, five, six. I remember six. I said

17:48.267 --> 17:49.008
seven. I remember six. And then I had another one 
down at Palmerston on the Victoria. That would be

17:55.097 --> 17:58.903
seven. And the way he worked it was they grow the 
crops and then at the end of the year split things up

17:58.923 --> 18:05.012
50-50? Yes, in other words, he supplied the mules 
and the feed and everything. But he got his money

18:14.746 --> 18:23.880
first

18:14.746 --> 18:23.880
in the fall when they sold. Sometimes they'd be in 
the third or the fourth bale before this

18:24.120 --> 18:30.109
sharecropper would get a cent. Or he might let them 
have a little. But when they first got their first

18:35.485 --> 18:48.487
money that was theirs, they'd go by the meat market 
and get meat, lean meat, and make jerky out of it.

18:50.130 --> 18:59.386
And you could go down there and see it on the barbed 
wires and the clothes lines up and down these

18:50.130 --> 18:59.386
houses. They'd like to make that jerky.

19:05.776 --> 19:21.100
But

19:05.776 --> 19:21.100
I interpreted for, when he had to leave, I remember 
he went in federal court, called it a federal court

19:05.776 --> 19:21.100
in Houston. And he was gone a few days and asked me to 
sell the cotton. The merchants couldn't talk

19:26.809 --> 19:31.176
Mexican, and he had some runners who couldn't talk 
English. And so, oh, and the doctor, who happened

19:33.012 --> 19:38.457
to be my uncle, came out of the place. I always did 
the interpreting for him. He couldn't talk a word

19:40.179 --> 19:42.321
of Spanish. I'd talk Spanish before I could talk 
English. And being around these renters, in fact,

19:46.526 --> 19:56.656
my father employed a woman who had taught school in 
Mexico. And he told her, not a word of English

19:56.696 --> 20:03.002
around that child. I was about three or four, 
three, I guess. And she, her husband was employed,

20:08.474 --> 20:16.227
but he, just as a laborer. And she would come and 
help my mother with the dishes. And then she'd take

20:23.218 --> 20:25.221
me home and spend the day. And by the time I got back, 
it was about dark. So I got to hear very little

20:28.026 --> 20:30.610
English. And so first thing you know, I was talking 
Spanish, and I could handle it much better than I

20:32.227 --> 20:39.415
could English. I talked to them before I could 
English. It's easier than English, much easier.

20:44.660 --> 20:58.075
And when I started first grade school, I guess I was 
six, and when the teacher would ask me a question,

20:44.660 --> 20:58.075
I'd start answering in Spanish, and I just, it was 
natural for me. And all the kids got to laughing, I

21:03.125 --> 21:10.375
could answer it faster in Spanish, because the 
words would come easier. And then I started to have

21:10.395 --> 21:15.502
to, that's the way I started learning English, was 
in the first grade. It was Aunt Lady? Well, my

21:17.846 --> 21:28.621
mother and sister, and she taught school, and we 
were both going to school at the same time through

21:17.846 --> 21:28.621
the fourth grade. I went with her. But...

21:35.525 --> 21:52.630
My mother never did try to talk it, and she got a 
little bit impatient and disgusted

21:35.525 --> 21:52.630
with some of them, and come up there and said, no 
entiendo, that I don't understand, in other

21:35.525 --> 21:52.630
words. And she couldn't make them understand, and 
she called me.

22:00.702 --> 22:03.085
But I liked it. It gave me an entrance to these 
Mexicans and oh, I, when they'd have a wedding or

22:03.773 --> 22:12.687
anything like that, I got invited. I went and I 
remember my father would not allow drinking nor

22:12.707 --> 22:20.760
gambling on the place. When he ever got one, he 
found it drinking. He'd get rid of it.

22:28.917 --> 22:30.919
He didn't like these mechs and talk English. He 
says, when they get up, these renters, when they

22:30.939 --> 22:37.365
get up and talk English too much, they don't make 
good farmers. They don't know too much. He did it

22:40.829 --> 22:41.850
jokingly. But

22:42.831 --> 22:48.976
I ran into a poker game. I think they were using 
grains of corn instead of the actual money. But

22:54.602 --> 22:55.523
they were gambling. It was on a Sunday. And they're 
all old. stopped when I walked into the room. And I

23:02.353 --> 23:05.658
walked through the house just like the kids. So I 
never did tell on those Mexicans and of course they

23:07.260 --> 23:14.832
knew it and so I was really accepted after that. 
When did this renter system stop or when did it end?

23:21.770 --> 23:29.999
Oh, I think it was still going half and half where 
the landowner would supply the things. And they

23:30.800 --> 23:36.466
also had renters or sharecroppers who worked on 
third and fourth. I believe that was

23:37.928 --> 23:45.256
right offhand, I don't remember which of the 
third. One was on corn and the fourth was on cotton,

23:45.376 --> 23:48.840
just opposite. But the one down at Thomaston, 
close to Guadalupe River, between Cora and

23:49.715 --> 24:00.305
Victoria, my mother's place, that was on 3rd and 
4th. And they'd make a good drop, they'd haul it up

24:01.546 --> 24:17.460
there to home, or either he'd buy it from my father, 
but the shack proper owned his own teams.

24:22.925 --> 24:26.049
But that place always paid for itself. Is the 
system still functioning today? I don't know.

24:32.857 --> 24:37.723
There are very few farms, nearly all grassland 
now, grazing land. Okay, okay. When you were about

24:41.628 --> 24:49.017
16, the United States declared war on Germany, and 
there are a lot of German German, people of German

24:49.368 --> 24:52.974
descent in Texas. Do you remember any anti-German 
feelings during the war in your last year or two? Oh

24:57.621 --> 25:11.062
yes, in fact I was, Cuero was, Cuero, Yorktown, 
Nordheim,

24:57.621 --> 25:11.062
Hallettsville, Schillenberg, Brenham, all 
Germans, Germans. There were a few checks up

25:11.563 --> 25:17.552
around Holheim between Cuero and Gonzales. And 
there were a few Polish people at Sweet Home

25:18.140 --> 25:24.166
between Yoakum and Hollisville. But outside of 
that, nearly all Germans. The checks have

25:27.470 --> 25:31.794
increased greatly. I still take that quarrel 
record. It comes out twice a week. And as long as my

25:37.940 --> 25:47.590
sister was living until 78,

25:49.105 --> 25:53.571
I didn't take it, because she always would write to 
me and give me the news. But since then, I've been

25:54.432 --> 25:59.499
taking it, and oh, nearly all German names. 
Occasionally there's a Smith and a Brown and a

26:01.301 --> 26:05.146
Jones. And I have one nephew in Quirrell, and I have 
one in Yoakum. And I very, very seldom see anything

26:09.552 --> 26:14.259
about the name Burns anymore. And oh. See, my 
father had four brothers and five sisters. There

26:23.456 --> 26:25.138
were ten in the family. Burns is all over the 
county. It's just reversed here. I used to be the

26:31.424 --> 26:37.389
only Burns in the Bryan College Station telephone 
directory. Now, there's a terrific column of

26:38.150 --> 26:42.314
them. And the former students, in the former 
students, A directory. I had two cousins who

26:48.056 --> 26:50.540
finished here. And,

26:50.580 --> 26:55.345
oh, and a nephew. And I guess there must have been 
about six or eight Burnes' in there. And now

27:00.091 --> 27:04.817
there's about two whole columns of them. And lots 
of Burnes' students and a lot of people who live

27:04.837 --> 27:11.445
here by that name, too. Blacks and whites. Why do 
you think that is? I don't know. I don't know.

27:18.235 --> 27:22.561
Getting back to the war, could you tell me about 
some of this anti-German or pro-German cinema?

27:22.581 --> 27:30.594
Well, only I was in school with one boy who was a 
German sympathizer. His father was a saloon

27:31.355 --> 27:36.463
keeper, a good man. But these

27:37.445 --> 27:44.736
boys, there were two boys and I think one sister, 
And the one I was in, he had a temper. And somebody

27:48.594 --> 27:59.428
hurt him one day, and he was talking about when 
Germany was going to defeat America and all of that

27:48.594 --> 27:59.428
stuff. And I tell you, the kids really did resent 
it. And it was very anti-German. And

28:06.276 --> 28:12.063
I noticed a change. I kind of felt sorry for the 
youngster. But I never heard anymore. I think they

28:19.390 --> 28:21.535
moved to Houston. But the mother, one reason they 
resented them, because this boy's grandmother

28:21.555 --> 28:30.872
lived with them, lived there for years, and she 
couldn't talk a word of English. And I think all of

28:31.634 --> 28:33.698
them talked German when they got home. And other 
people didn't like that. Oh, I think... I think we

28:40.825 --> 28:42.867
accused them unjustly. That's why I said that in a 
state of anger.

28:50.134 --> 28:54.598
But

28:50.134 --> 28:54.598
I never did resent him. I spoke to him when I saw him, 
but that was about as close as I ever got to him. But I

29:02.265 --> 29:07.710
could notice in the classroom the attitude of the 
other kids. youngsters can be pretty mean. Oh,

29:10.983 --> 29:14.507
they can, yes, they certainly can. Why'd you come 
to Texas A&M in 1919, wasn't it? Yes, my father took

29:19.092 --> 29:25.418
me to the train and he says, what course are you 
going to take? I came here because he was such a firm

29:25.438 --> 29:30.443
believer in the school. And because he had taken 
some of these short courses during the summer?

29:34.127 --> 29:37.090
Yes, well, his nephew, My first cousin was head of 
the animal husbandry department at that time. Oh,

29:43.295 --> 29:44.916
really? John C. Burns.

29:51.643 --> 30:05.676
He was in class in 1905, I believe, and A.C. Burns 
finished in 1907, and then went to Ohio State and

29:51.643 --> 30:05.676
studied by doing medicine.

30:07.040 --> 30:18.453
And then Douglas Burns, who was later general 
manager of the Pitchfork Ranch,

30:07.040 --> 30:18.453
graduated in 16. So those three brothers came 
here, and they all did so well. And my father just,

30:24.479 --> 30:32.628
for one thing, he tried to send those. Now, I had one 
brother who went to Vanderbilt to study medicine.

30:37.162 --> 30:50.901
But the other two that were ranchers, especially 
Tom, he played hooky, and I doubt if he went beyond

30:37.162 --> 30:50.901
second or third grade, and probably the best 
businessman in the whole family. And just a

30:52.523 --> 30:54.867
self-made man, so to speak. But he sure didn't get 
it out of school.

31:00.555 --> 31:05.802
And he was a huckleberry thing.

31:07.486 --> 31:17.922
But I remember when my father and my mother were 
getting married, my aunt, she was an advisor for

31:07.486 --> 31:17.922
the family. Everybody would have problems, 
they'd go to Aunt Ella. And she told my mother, she

31:23.932 --> 31:27.417
says, Anna, you're going to have trouble with Tom. 
That's the oldest brother of mine. You're going to

31:30.282 --> 31:31.063
have trouble.
