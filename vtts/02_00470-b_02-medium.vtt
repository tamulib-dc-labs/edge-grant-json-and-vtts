WEBVTT

00:01.212 --> 00:28.975
feeling about finally getting into the war well it 
wasn't really that you know I was glad to get in the

00:01.212 --> 00:28.975
war I just felt like it was a continuation of what 
I'd been doing right I had been accepting all the

00:01.212 --> 00:28.975
assignments been given to me and it's been my lot to 
stay in the states four years my wife was with me all

00:01.212 --> 00:28.975
that time sure I'd had even though it was black 
outfit we'd had pretty good success. We'd had lots

00:30.303 --> 00:36.849
of accommodations, and so the assignment to 
Europe... You did have a lot of accommodations?

00:36.869 --> 00:37.389
Oh, we did. We did. Uh, both as individual, uh, 
individuals and units, and we accomplished a lot

00:39.972 --> 00:48.880
of things. But, uh, really, it was just another 
assignment. I didn't really feel like, well, here

00:51.582 --> 00:56.347
I come in Europe, or gosh, I've got to go to Europe. 
You know, just, that's it. You just wanted to do

00:59.448 --> 01:02.793
your duty regardless of it. That's correct. Okay, 
then when you got overseas, can you tell me about

01:05.556 --> 01:14.008
your assignment there?

01:14.028 --> 01:24.442
Yeah, we left the States sometime in February.

01:25.143 --> 01:26.164
Went to Europe, had a Really had a fine trip over as 
far as war trips go. We were on a South American

01:32.574 --> 01:39.223
liner of the Uruguay, which was a converted 
pleasure. Very nice ship. 5,000

01:41.026 --> 01:44.811
troops. And the officers were traveling in a 
different status than a lot of people did. We ate

01:55.445 --> 01:57.788
courtesy of the ship. So you probably had good 
food. Oh, gosh. We had a printed menu. Printed

02:04.728 --> 02:06.431
menu. And the table of four officers had an 
individual waiter. We did. Now that sounds

02:14.324 --> 02:21.696
strange to a lot of people for a troop ship at that 
stage of the war, but we did. We had a Hungarian boy

02:21.816 --> 02:25.682
that waited on the table. And we had a printed menu, 
and we ate three meals a day. The darndest thing

02:32.475 --> 02:35.259
that you've ever seen. It was absolutely... I 
brought one of the menus home, and my wife couldn't

02:36.621 --> 02:40.286
believe it. How about the enlisted men? What kind 
of treatment did they have? Well, they ate in child

02:43.591 --> 02:48.017
lines, and they had good food. It was... Because I 
went many times down through the child lines with

02:48.798 --> 02:54.927
them, but they... They, like all the other troop 
ship soldiers, I'm sure, lined up and went through

02:55.750 --> 03:06.786
a sort of a fix-your-tray-line type thing. And I 
never did understand that. It really was not good

03:08.849 --> 03:13.475
for morale, I'm sure. No. But that was the 
dictates. We paid for this. The U.S. government?

03:21.487 --> 03:22.348
Oh, I'm sure they did. In other words, they just 
hired a— Took over the ship in some manner. However

03:31.003 --> 03:33.787
they— And it was run by Uruguayans? I don't really 
know who ran the ship, but they called it— No, it was

03:34.948 --> 03:49.929
a South American liner, probably headquartered 
in New York or somewhere prior to the war, but I

03:34.948 --> 03:49.929
really don't know who owned the Uruguay. It was a— 
But it was a pleasure boat of some sort. But this

03:55.624 --> 04:02.851
Hungarian cabin boy, he was some cabin boy. One of 
the things that was always interesting to me, he

04:02.871 --> 04:10.960
felt offended if you wouldn't take a little bit of 
each entree on his menu. Oh, sir, he was so good, you

04:12.201 --> 04:14.603
know. He was just trying to promote his food. But he 
was right. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. So, how

04:23.551 --> 04:26.976
much did he gain, how many pounds did he gain on that 
trip? I was doing pretty smart. But it was a 12-day

04:28.538 --> 04:31.202
voyage. The first three of them were, we went up 
high in the Atlantic and it was a rough, rough seas.

04:37.571 --> 04:38.532
We went convoy. I remember the ships, I mean a lot of 
them. Destroyers? Yes. You could see them

04:44.942 --> 04:49.508
circling all the way around. first three days we 
had terribly rough seas we got in one storm that it

04:50.990 --> 05:20.170
was so rough that it broke some of the lifeboats off 
of the davits and that you could hear them falling

04:50.990 --> 05:20.170
down the side of the ship and i was on duty one 
morning with my troops and uh sitting a chair at the

04:50.990 --> 05:20.170
head of the stairs and it got so rough that i just had 
to hold around the rail you know you couldn't

04:50.990 --> 05:20.170
you're nothing would stay still. Garbage cans 
would come down the hallways and people try to walk

05:23.398 --> 05:32.173
and you'd have to hold on to rails you know it it was 
terribly rough. I never did get sick but I sure

05:34.638 --> 05:40.107
didn't feel good for a couple of days. But finally 
it's moved out and we got on over to landed in Le

05:44.939 --> 05:46.220
Havre. We missed England. At that time they were 
going directly into France. They had opened up Le

05:51.425 --> 06:00.753
Havre and we went in on a temporary pier that they 
had built. And that was in February 1945? 1945,

06:02.134 --> 06:05.477
that's correct. And we were moved out to one of the 
camps out from Le Havre where they set you up to

06:15.297 --> 06:22.267
de-process and get your equipment back with you 
and unwrap it. All tools had to be wrapped and

06:22.747 --> 06:27.834
waterproofed and all this to go overseas. We got 
all of our shop trucks back and got the tools

06:29.316 --> 06:36.126
unwrapped and got ready to be operational. And we 
were ordered up to Hasselt, Belgium.

06:44.407 --> 07:02.715
real interesting one of the movies recently where 
Eisenhower

06:44.407 --> 07:02.715
had to meet with Montgomery to straighten out some 
command problems they went to Hasselt and it

06:44.407 --> 07:02.715
showed the depot up there and here's Hasselt, 
Belgium that sort of brought back memories to me.

07:04.077 --> 07:06.881
Did you ever did you ever get to see either one of 
those? No not over there. So we went on we went to

07:09.646 --> 07:12.490
Hasselt and uh I was just entirely on my own. Nobody 
told me where to camp or where to put up or whatever.

07:23.265 --> 07:29.130
So I sent one of my officers out to find us a villa to 
live in. The British had the town majors who were

07:30.511 --> 07:41.120
sort of like mayors who had taken over for 
management and running various towns. We found an

07:41.861 --> 07:43.202
empty villa. And so we went to the town major, and he 
said, move in. So we moved in, moved the whole

07:48.288 --> 07:54.415
company in this big Belgian villa. Was that like a 
hotel then? No, just a big home. Just a big home. And

08:01.103 --> 08:05.689
it was about three stories, big grounds. Had my 
company office there. All the vehicles would be

08:09.954 --> 08:12.497
parked around on the grounds. And then the 
officers and the key non-commissioned officers

08:13.540 --> 08:23.534
were authorized to go out and live on the economy, 
that is, have quarters. We'd go find some Belgian

08:24.155 --> 08:30.464
that was willing to take us in his home, and we lived 
in their homes. And I know they were reimbursed in

08:31.625 --> 08:38.395
some manner, but this town major would take us. 
Like you're renting a room from them? Yeah, that's

08:39.877 --> 08:40.397
right. Really? Yeah. How'd you get along with 
those people? Real fine. They were really

08:44.205 --> 08:48.151
receptive to us, of course. They were happy to be on 
board. Another awesome... Room and board? No,

08:55.001 --> 08:55.642
just room. We ate with the company. I lived with an 
old Belgian lady and her teenage daughter. Her

09:06.538 --> 09:08.100
husband was a captive. The daughter had been 
captured and still was unheard from. One son had

09:13.934 --> 09:19.520
been, he had gone off to the RAF and he'd been shot 
down. So they were really tied up in the war. And

09:23.824 --> 09:26.567
they'd have one fireplace in the whole building. 
We'd sit around at night, you know, running their

09:26.607 --> 09:31.252
fire and they'd talk. They spoke English. Enough 
we could understand. Yeah. Her husband was a

09:38.337 --> 09:44.787
mining engineer, and the Germans had captured 
him, and I'm sure had used his mining talents. But

09:46.270 --> 09:50.156
we had a real interesting living there. We stayed 
there about 30 days, and finally were ordered to

09:50.256 --> 10:00.733
liaise Belgium to be assigned to a depot, a big 
engineer depot. It was straddle of the Albert

10:01.861 --> 10:08.648
Canal and several of those other canals there, and 
all the supplies came in by water. And this depot

10:09.709 --> 10:13.252
unloaded everything with cranes. That's a drag 
line crane. They had about 40 of those things in

10:17.437 --> 10:30.670
that depot, and my job was to maintain those cranes 
and take equipment that had come back off the front

10:17.437 --> 10:30.670
and either repair it or salvage it, whichever. If 
it was where we could feasibly repair it and put it

10:33.291 --> 10:40.701
back in the depot, we'd do so. Now that's water 
pumps, bulldozers, motor graders, any type of

10:41.082 --> 10:49.514
engineer equipment. It would come back. Were your 
men trained well enough? That's right. They were

10:52.719 --> 10:53.980
trained to do this work. That's correct. We had 
shops where we could make parts, you know, relays.

11:00.383 --> 11:10.754
Machine shops, all these mobile type machine 
shops where they had all these things in these

11:00.383 --> 11:10.754
closed-in

11:00.383 --> 11:10.754
cab type trucks. Very talented group of people. 
And it was our sole responsibility when a piece of

11:15.259 --> 11:24.809
equipment came back to say that it's either 
repaired or thrown away. My shop officer had that

11:25.050 --> 11:28.213
sole responsibility. It was his judgment to say we 
fix it or throw it away. If we fixed it, it went back

11:34.386 --> 11:37.069
into the depot. If it was not salvable in any 
manner, then the depot would issue a new one to the

11:37.990 --> 11:43.878
using unit. So we got some stuff back off the front 
that was in terrible shape. I would imagine. But it

11:50.146 --> 11:51.007
was interesting. It was really an interesting 
assignment.

11:56.510 --> 12:08.183
We stayed with that until,

11:56.510 --> 12:08.183
oh, must have been about somewhere like

11:56.510 --> 12:08.183
October or November of that year. The war was over. 
We had been in the States so long, we didn't have

12:12.128 --> 12:15.732
many points. You know what points were. We didn't 
have many, or I didn't have many points. So I was not

12:21.278 --> 12:23.901
eligible for rotation. Let me back up just a little 
bit. We were originally scheduled to go to the

12:27.886 --> 12:42.542
South Pacific, but the war was over, so we did not 
go, and we stayed in that area because they didn't

12:27.886 --> 12:42.542
have many points. What was there to do now that the 
damage from the battle was over? Well, after we got

12:50.982 --> 13:07.143
After we got sidetracked from going to Europe, I 
mean to South Pacific, then I was assigned to this

12:50.982 --> 13:07.143
labor supervision company because of my 
engineering ability, background, and that was a

12:50.982 --> 13:07.143
German staffed company. It was German PWs. 
Really? German PWs. That's fascinating. German

13:12.330 --> 13:14.593
soldiers and German officers. Okay, well let's 
talk about that in a minute here, but before we

13:15.215 --> 13:31.090
leave your last assignment, let's just, you were 
in the northern, let's talk about this, you were in

13:15.215 --> 13:31.090
the northern zone, which was basically the zone of 
the British Army under Montgomery. What were the

13:32.271 --> 13:37.716
relationships, what were the relations like 
between the American and British soldiers, do you

13:32.271 --> 13:37.716
remember? I had no contact to that problem. I've I 
operated under this depot commander, and I never

13:44.375 --> 13:50.162
got in combat at all. Right, but I just thought that 
maybe you might—you never repaired any British

13:50.542 --> 13:55.287
equipment? No. They had their own— That's right. 
The only thing—everybody knew of the problem, and

13:59.432 --> 14:11.766
everybody talked about the British, and all they 
could do was convoy up and down the road and stop for

13:59.432 --> 14:11.766
tea when it came time to do so. You know, we didn't 
have... But it was sort of common knowledge that

14:13.449 --> 14:16.213
there was a problem? Oh, yes, absolutely. But how 
profound do you think this problem was? Or was it

14:19.857 --> 14:25.625
just a matter of the Americans or, you know, the 
Yangs making fun of the British? No, I think it was a

14:25.645 --> 14:28.729
real problem. I think it really was. And I think the 
big part of it, and, of course, I've learned a lot of

14:31.313 --> 14:39.964
this subsequent, was in the upper structures of 
command. Yeah, sure. There's no question it was a

14:43.200 --> 14:45.383
problem. I expect as far as an American soldier or 
American company working with a British company,

14:46.564 --> 14:53.052
there probably wasn't any of that. It's a matter of 
getting along. But it's common knowledge, but I

14:57.277 --> 15:02.423
had no contact with that sort of thing at all. Okay, 
now let's move on. Then the war is over. Let's move

15:05.146 --> 15:07.148
on to the labor. Okay. the labor company. What was 
your job there for such to find them? Okay I was

15:13.593 --> 15:38.503
assigned to command this labor supervision 
company which was I believe about 250 German PWs

15:13.593 --> 15:38.503
and there was I believe I had three German officers 
at that time and we were winterizing and

15:13.593 --> 15:38.503
electrifying these redeployment camps where the 
soldiers were coming back to go through

15:39.108 --> 15:42.231
Marseilles and go home or wherever. And these 
camps were where they came in. Their equipment was

15:46.134 --> 15:50.137
all turned in. They were issued new clothes. 
Records were all processed so that they could go

15:53.480 --> 16:00.186
from there directly to Marseilles to get on a boat. 
That's the reason they called it a redeployment

16:00.206 --> 16:03.229
camp. We were taking these tents, these big 
paramdo tents, putting wood floors in them,

16:09.162 --> 16:23.238
putting wood parapets around the edges to protect 
them from the cold weather, putting electric

16:09.162 --> 16:23.238
lights into them, and building streets and roads 
around through them. But I was one of about 10 of

16:23.258 --> 16:29.746
those labor supervision companies in this one 
camp, one headquarters. Where was this in France?

16:33.110 --> 16:37.735
It was in Calais, north of Marseille. We had this 
prisoner of war camp with, I expect there were

16:38.626 --> 16:44.953
6,000 PWs. 6,000. I imagine there were. And real 
strange, PWs guarded the PWs. Really? Yeah. That

16:55.384 --> 16:56.245
is strange. Yeah. We had German PWs on the gate. Of 
course, we'd have an American sergeant there, but

17:00.290 --> 17:06.777
we didn't have near enough Americans to do all the 
guarding. But you didn't have to worry about those

17:07.432 --> 17:16.042
guys being in camp at night, because the French 
would catch them out, and then they wouldn't even

17:07.432 --> 17:16.042
come back. That's right. So at nighttime, those 
Germans wanted to be in that camp, in that

17:17.223 --> 17:23.270
compound. So they went out and worked as a company 
in this Calais area. I had one engineer officer in

17:28.636 --> 17:35.363
my company, and then three Germans, and they 
were... not graduate engineers, but engineers to

17:35.883 --> 17:45.298
the degree that they could supervise carpentry 
and electric and this sort of thing.

17:46.801 --> 17:54.834
They supervised these 250 people during the day, 
marshed them back at night, and put them in the

17:46.801 --> 17:54.834
compound. And I had to inspect the work and see that 
it The officers signed the morning report. What

18:04.466 --> 18:06.549
was the quality of the work? Excellent. Good 
workers? Excellent. Every one of them knew a

18:09.612 --> 18:10.834
trade. Really? Every German had some skill. 
That's something that we could pattern after. We

18:20.025 --> 18:27.454
had a little craft shop there where we'd let them 
work off times and build various things, you know.

18:28.155 --> 18:29.937
And one of them might be a wood inlayer. another 
might be a brick mason another one an expert at

18:30.372 --> 18:56.076
electricity and you know various things they 
could just absolutely fascinate you with the

18:30.372 --> 18:56.076
craftsmen that they were so it was a it was an 
interesting assignment I was with that from oh I

18:30.372 --> 18:56.076
guess this September October whenever until the 
next February General Butler had quite a few good

18:57.068 --> 19:03.677
things to say about the quality of German 
soldiers. Would you agree? Oh, absolutely. They

19:06.581 --> 19:11.467
were absolutely outstanding. Outstanding. How 
could you compare a German soldier with American

19:12.248 --> 19:14.952
soldiers? Well, I'd say across the board he was as 
good or better. When I say as good or better, they

19:20.479 --> 19:23.143
were strong. I guess they were more specialists 
than our people were. But I think it must have been a

19:29.201 --> 19:35.571
dictate from parents or somebody over there. They 
had to learn a trade of some kind. And they were

19:40.239 --> 19:43.765
highly skilled. Did you ever get to know the German 
officers? Did you ever converse with them? Or did

19:48.842 --> 19:51.025
they only speak German? Or did you ever have any 
personal relations with them? Well, the German

19:53.548 --> 20:03.340
officers that I had could not speak English, so I 
really didn't discuss much with them except

19:53.548 --> 20:03.340
direct them to go over this and that. But there were 
about 15 or 16 American officers in this camp, and

20:03.360 --> 20:13.633
we each had our own little headquarters or on 
little quarters and we had German orderlies to

20:13.883 --> 20:25.521
take care of the cleaning and this sort of thing and 
I conversed with those people to a great degree. We

20:27.123 --> 20:39.782
picked most of them because they could speak 
English and they'd come and clean our quarters and

20:27.123 --> 20:39.782
make our beds and wash our clothes and you know 
various things like that. And I had an interesting

20:42.993 --> 20:46.576
The one that I had was from the Russian sector of 
Germany. He was happy to be in France. He didn't

20:50.100 --> 20:52.682
want to go home. He didn't want to go home. And he 
told me, and this was real strange, and I didn't

20:55.244 --> 21:11.920
really take it at the time as being insubordinate, 
but he told me, he said, Captain, he said,

20:55.244 --> 21:11.920
Americans will learn that they fought the wrong 
people. And at the time, it didn't make much of an

21:12.946 --> 21:15.890
impact. But I have thought about that 10,000 
times. He was so right. He was absolutely so right.

21:24.722 --> 21:29.870
But here's a little private, a little 
insignificant private. And he was so apologetic.

21:35.177 --> 21:36.759
He said, pardon me, sir. I want to tell you 
something. I beg your pardon. You know, they were

21:39.903 --> 21:42.447
real humble when they went down. He said, 
Americans will learn that they fought their own

21:43.540 --> 21:49.206
people. The private show didn't know what he was 
talking about. It would really be interesting to

21:52.950 --> 22:01.819
know what happened to that little fella, because 
he told me he didn't know

21:52.950 --> 22:01.819
anything. But it was a great experience I had. 
Yeah, to be in command of this. That's right. I

22:08.325 --> 22:11.168
learned a whole lot from him. It was something 
different.

22:17.881 --> 22:24.408
How about food and health and living conditions 
for prisoners of war? Let's move this over here.

22:25.830 --> 22:30.415
How about things like that, food, health, living 
conditions for the prisoners of war? Well, the

22:32.598 --> 22:39.726
only ones I know of were the ones that I was directly 
in contact with. They had little tents. And we

22:41.894 --> 22:45.579
provided some beds. And the Red Cross had provided 
some blankets for them to put on. There wasn't much

22:51.948 --> 22:53.350
to their beds. Most of them were made probably out 
of boards or some plywood or something like that.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.723
But they had adequate food. It was prepared in one 
central kitchen in this compound. Of course, I

23:10.328 --> 23:17.943
really didn't have any responsibility for 
preparing the food, and I never ate over there, but

23:10.328 --> 23:17.943
I know that they told me they had plenty. It was hot, 
and it wasn't a bunch of goop all mixed up. It was

23:23.453 --> 23:25.918
food that was prepared properly. So I think my 
particular compound, I doubt that they had very

23:27.000 --> 23:33.012
much to complain about. Had plenty of food. In 
other words, the prisoners of war you thought were

23:34.353 --> 23:41.022
treated fairly well after a rather savage 
six-year ordeal. That's right. I imagine from the

23:43.145 --> 24:02.290
last probably two years of their service, 
wherever they were, with the destitute

23:43.145 --> 24:02.290
conditions that Jeremy had gotten in, I'm sure 
they were a whole lot better off in an American

23:43.145 --> 24:02.290
compound being looked after. than they were back 
in their homeland scratching for something to

24:02.928 --> 24:07.914
eat. Because Germany was starving in 1945, 1946. 
Absolutely. Did you have an opportunity to travel

24:13.561 --> 24:16.624
to Germany? Yes, just to go. On like a leave? No, 
just get in the vehicle and drive up just to look.

24:29.279 --> 24:32.243
But not to speak of. The only thing that I really saw 
of Germany was I got to know an Air Force pilot, and

24:32.425 --> 24:43.558
he took me one time on a reconnaissance flight. We 
went up over

24:43.618 --> 24:57.994
Aachen, Cologne, the Bavarian Alps, just made a 
big circle up the Ruhr and the Rhine to look at the

24:43.618 --> 24:57.994
damage and the bombs. That's the most extensive 
opportunity to see Germany that I got was in an

24:58.379 --> 25:08.935
A-26, when these attacked bombers. And other than 
that, I'd just get in the Jeep, and we'd just drive

25:10.016 --> 25:15.384
across the border and come back. But I saw a whole 
lot of Europe, because when I had this engineering

25:16.987 --> 25:26.040
maintenance company, they assigned one of my 
platoons to Antwerp. And to get there, I had to go

25:26.712 --> 25:35.840
through, go into, of course, from Belgium to 
Holland and then up into Antwerp. And they were in

25:36.581 --> 25:41.986
Antwerp while the buzz bombs were falling. In 
fact, my company got a bronze star or whatever it

25:42.006 --> 25:49.433
was because of the buzz bombs falling. My troops 
were up there helping maintain the port equipment

25:53.982 --> 25:55.284
at the port of Antler. Keep the port open. Right. 
And the Germans tried to knock the port out, of

25:58.969 --> 26:02.954
course. But that sojourn with the Germans was 
something that I'm glad is on the record.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.232
Were you happy to come home in 1946? Oh, 
absolutely. And I had not been there, of course,

26:18.876 --> 26:21.719
near like a lot of them. I was really just gone a 
year. I left in February and got back in February

26:23.902 --> 26:31.274
but I was of course glad to get home. A couple of 
strange things. I really don't know how I got

26:37.545 --> 26:48.964
assigned to this transportation company coming 
home but I was assigned to a transportation

26:37.545 --> 26:48.964
company and I forgot whether I listed it down there 
or not but

26:55.222 --> 26:56.644
No, these were the labor suit. Anyhow, the company 
that I came home with was a transportation

26:57.165 --> 27:01.691
company. And of course, all the shipping was under 
the transportation court. So belonging to a

27:08.361 --> 27:15.711
transportation company, we sort of got a little 
favored treatment on the way home. because we were

27:16.754 --> 27:20.157
transportation, and of course the ship was 
transportation. Right, right. So you had a

27:21.439 --> 27:25.343
pleasure craft on the way over and on the way back. 
But I did get some assignments. I was assigned as

27:27.785 --> 27:40.338
the police and prison officer for the ship coming 
home, which meant that I had to see that the place

27:27.785 --> 27:40.338
was cleaned up and kept orderly and all this all 
over the ship. That was my assignment coming home.

27:43.621 --> 27:46.744
But the fact that I was on the So the staff, the 
captain of the ship, whatever they called him at

27:47.197 --> 27:57.153
that time, had me eat with him a number of times in 
his cabin. I came back on a Liberty ship, a Victory

27:58.736 --> 28:02.582
ship, I guess it was. But I did have an interesting 
assignment coming home. I made many trips around

28:07.189 --> 28:12.698
that ship in those 12 days because I'd have to go in 
the morning first thing and then when the colonel

28:13.252 --> 28:42.465
inspected the ship i had to go back and travel over 
the whole ship with him when he made his inspection

28:13.252 --> 28:42.465
and he went every day too so the time must have gone 
pretty fast it did it was i enjoyed having some

28:13.252 --> 28:42.465
responsibility but uh eating with the captain was 
almost like eating with the uh with the uh south

28:13.252 --> 28:42.465
american liner i betcha

28:13.252 --> 28:42.465
and Another strange coincidence, we left out, I 
guess it's strange, we left out, we went through

28:42.901 --> 28:58.042
Weehawken, New Jersey, went to New York, Pier 31, I 
believe it was, boarded the ship. Coming back, we

28:59.243 --> 29:04.791
got off on Pier 31, got on a ferry boat, went right 
back to Weehawken, right back to Camp Cameron, New

29:05.581 --> 29:07.703
Jersey. I mean, exactly backtrack. Didn't even, 
same pier, got off the same pier. So that's, that is

29:14.290 --> 29:16.012
sort of strange. I was, I was wondering, you were 
discharged from active duty in 1946.

29:24.081 --> 29:31.048
Many people in America were rather worried about 
falling back into a depression after the war.

29:32.092 --> 29:45.607
about job opportunities or a number of popular 
opinion polls taken, which all demonstrated that

29:32.092 --> 29:45.607
the American people were slightly or rather 
insecure about their future. Were you at all

29:45.668 --> 29:49.252
worried about your future when you got out in 1946? 
No, because I had a leave of absence from the

29:49.352 --> 30:00.124
highway department, had a guaranteed return job, 
and the highway department had had not been able to

30:01.623 --> 30:11.757
expend monies on highways for four years because 
of material and equipment. And they were 20 years

30:11.777 --> 30:13.540
behind. They had tons of work. Had tons of work and 
lots of money to do it with. And it was a matter of

30:21.571 --> 30:24.155
them getting geared up to do it. And they were 
taking back everybody that left them and a lot of

30:30.530 --> 30:34.114
people that wanted to come back and work. So 
really, I had a very bright future. No problems at

30:38.019 --> 30:39.340
all. I went right back to work. And we just had work 
running out our ears. So I was not faced with that

30:46.529 --> 30:48.971
problem. Would you consider that you had 
indefinite aims and goals when you got out of the

30:49.032 --> 30:54.558
service in 46? Oh, yeah. I was going back to the 
highway department to be a highway engineer. That

30:59.403 --> 31:01.806
was my aim from the time I was 11 years old. Right. I 
was still in the same pipeline. Okay. Now, then

31:06.832 --> 31:11.698
let's turn back to your career again, your 
post-war career in the Reserves. Why'd you decide

31:11.758 --> 31:14.862
to stay in the Reserves? Well, I had heard some of 
the people back in the late 20s and early 30s talk

31:17.325 --> 31:28.279
about the interest they'd had in the Reserve and 
The fact that it had enhanced them during World War

31:28.782 --> 31:31.706
II. A lot of them had been promoted over those 
years. A lot of them had gotten a lot of longevity.

31:38.236 --> 31:44.525
And so I went to looking for a place that I could get 
in an active reserve outfit. Also, it was thought

31:45.967 --> 31:55.380
that there would be a retirement someday for a 
reserve program. I'm not I don't know exactly what

31:55.732 --> 32:10.332
the status of retirement was at that time but I 
think there was a program whereby at the end of 20

31:55.732 --> 32:10.332
years you you had some built-in uh yeah uh
