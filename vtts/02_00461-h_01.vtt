WEBVTT

00:01.465 --> 00:04.509
And she said that she did see me. She watched that 
match. And that match was a five-set match. Three

00:09.897 --> 00:12.121
out of five. And she said she did see me. But I didn't 
see her. I was probably busy. But I remember

00:19.051 --> 00:20.453
looking around for her. Because I wanted to 
impress her with my tennis. And she said she didn't

00:25.081 --> 00:27.766
see me. And we did get called up on our date. I went to 
the wrong place, or she went to the wrong place. So

00:34.677 --> 00:36.601
we had a date. I was there. Where were you? You

00:38.472 --> 00:52.588
know, that kind of thing. I have to step aside from 
coming back to my father. Not coming to the tennis

00:53.649 --> 00:54.570
courts, particularly. Due to lack of time, they'd 
be tired. So maybe

00:58.334 --> 01:02.899
they're on to my town. But I spent a great deal of 
time on those courts. Hanging around, even on a

01:03.921 --> 01:07.905
rainy day, waiting for them to dry.

01:12.256 --> 01:38.196
which

01:12.256 --> 01:38.196
bunk was

01:12.256 --> 01:38.196
she in the same bunk were you sitting standing 
lying uh oh we may have been lying side by side

01:39.357 --> 01:49.215
looking to keep warm it was an affectionate thing 
yeah it was you know obviously she must have had

01:39.357 --> 01:49.215
some like towards me to ask me for protection but 
and she was an attractive girl and like I said she

01:50.174 --> 02:12.267
was I think she had either a doctorate or some 
degree of psychology so she was a career woman I

01:50.174 --> 02:12.267
remember she had wore even one of those wool 
dresses so were popular in those days, a knobby

02:12.247 --> 02:23.689
kind of thing, textured school dress, expensive 
magnet type thing, nice clothes. Even in that

02:24.811 --> 02:33.748
little resort that was just trying to make it, I was 
trying to latch onto it and get my own school going.

02:34.657 --> 02:41.691
The other question would have to do with your early 
teaching skin in this country. You said you were

02:41.711 --> 02:46.420
teaching people who were with the Sierra Club and 
wanted to know how to get back to their cabins. Were

02:46.440 --> 02:50.569
these people who you taught one-on-one, or did you 
have masking classes of people? What was that

02:50.649 --> 02:51.771
like? A variety. Anything from one-on-one that's 
private lessons to 30, like every Easter, the

02:54.645 --> 03:05.254
board of directors would come up with their 
children. tiny tots up and bring their children

03:06.044 --> 03:15.515
over the Easter weekend and just dump them on me so 
that they could go skiing somewhere else. And I had

03:15.535 --> 03:20.801
these thirty kids for four or five years, 
probably. And I became, they were so thrilled with

03:20.821 --> 03:23.704
their progress. And I had a little race at the end of 
the week, of the Easter week, which we were putting

03:24.104 --> 03:33.435
the poles in a triangle and they had to go under it 
because that's what we were doing as kids. and see

03:33.415 --> 03:36.017
all the things that we were doing when I was 
teaching. And they loved it. And that's where this

03:37.559 --> 03:45.046
gal, Shafi, was in that class and later became an 
Olympic skier. Several of those kids made it to

03:45.246 --> 04:02.983
Dartmouth and to, yeah, onto the Olympic team 
because I met the lady of the president of the

03:45.246 --> 04:02.983
Sierra Club, lived in Berkeley, and I visited her. 
In fact, I was invited to her daughter's wedding,

04:03.217 --> 04:08.825
and I just feel terrible because I never gave her a 
present. I didn't have any money. I was invited to

04:09.706 --> 04:13.431
her daughter's present. She was also in that 
class.

04:17.677 --> 04:20.761
Yes, I think Dorothy Leonard. Jean, Dorothy, 
something like that. Leonard. Dick Leonard is the

04:23.585 --> 04:29.433
president of this year of this chapter, or maybe 
the national, I don't know. But he was an attorney.

04:31.786 --> 04:49.710
and lived in the Berkeley Hills, in a lovely home 
overlooking the bay, and they would gather up and

04:31.786 --> 04:49.710
they thought, the world of me, how marvelous, and 
the kids all love me, you know, and they became

04:31.786 --> 04:49.710
champions in their own right after that, giving 
him a good foundation, fun, Control,

04:49.943 --> 04:52.629
coordination, the fundamentals. What was your 
teaching style? Did you stick with the techniques

04:54.393 --> 04:59.485
a lot, or did you stop and tell jokes and stories in 
between? The whole thing. I believe in the whole

05:00.828 --> 05:03.514
thing. Maintain, get their attention and hold it, 
and you can only hold it by a variety of things

05:03.832 --> 05:12.880
instead of harping on one thing. You wanted to 
mention the same kind of relationship activities

05:12.900 --> 05:17.665
with Junior Davis. I did the same thing in APTIS. I 
had Junior Davis come volunteer. Volunteer.

05:23.590 --> 05:30.717
Volunteer to, came, a question came through from 
the, from the main, tennis association from San

05:30.697 --> 05:46.123
Francisco if I would start a Junior Davis

05:30.697 --> 05:46.123
Cup team in my area there, and I accepted the 
assignment. Mark was there, and I hired several,

05:46.677 --> 05:57.955
two or three local guys, Mark, to help me, and we 
had, oh God, how many, 40, 50 kids, boys and girls.

05:58.376 --> 06:03.103
And you took a program to, a similar program to 
Watsonville? Yes, I had a similar program,

06:03.124 --> 06:14.001
because a lady, the principal of a school from 
Watsonville, turned out to be a former national

06:03.124 --> 06:14.001
champion. Barbara Hedlund, a ranked player. And 
she found out about this club that we started. This

06:22.084 --> 06:30.557
was kind of a community that was not really into 
sports very much until Gina and I got in there. They

06:30.577 --> 06:34.063
had a little, but we really got it going. And 
Barbara Hedlund, they came kind of out of the

06:34.083 --> 06:38.871
woodwork, all these people that had been 
semi-retired. It was a retirement community,

06:38.891 --> 06:42.216
actually. She and I played doubles together, and 
we beat everybody. I mean, we could have gone on and

06:45.895 --> 06:54.898
gotten our own national ranking, but she had 
personal problems with her husband. And she and I

06:54.918 --> 06:57.825
would just scream at her. But that would have put 
you in a bad position because you would have gotten

06:58.312 --> 07:00.976
too much visibility. It would have been national 
publicity again. It was probably a good thing that

07:02.498 --> 07:05.803
whatever problems she had kept you from doing it. 
She was in national women's levels. Yeah, she was

07:07.746 --> 07:09.509
national. Yeah, she was already ranked. But her 
school, she asked if I would run a tennis program in

07:12.193 --> 07:23.830
Watsonville for her school after ours, which I 
did. You were single all that time. How did you

07:25.999 --> 07:27.942
spend your time when you weren't? No, no. Oh, okay. 
Before that then, backing up to the point that you

07:29.945 --> 07:40.299
were still single with the skiing and all, how did 
you spend your time when you weren't teaching?

07:40.319 --> 07:49.412
Well, usually looking for girls and food, good 
restaurants to eat because I didn't know how to

07:40.319 --> 07:49.412
cook. read, and usually girl watching, and maybe 
going to a dance here and there. So you go to public

07:56.661 --> 08:01.447
places a lot. Public places, and then would get 
involved with my own projects. I'd make up

08:04.972 --> 08:16.108
projects and involve myself unknowingly, like 
making movies, getting an 8mm camera and I

08:17.422 --> 08:23.711
discovered a flaw in my backhand in those days and 
straightened that out. I got myself a new backhand

08:23.752 --> 08:28.919
by taking movies, taking movies of all the top 
players. I have movies of

08:29.039 --> 08:36.531
guys that are now on television. Tony Trabert, his 
partner Talbert who runs the who was the

08:42.565 --> 08:45.688
tournament director for the U.S. Open in New York 
City. All these guys, they have movies. I studied

08:47.991 --> 08:51.154
all their technique. So I got in these, and I made 
ski movies. I found a girl that she always kids me

08:58.863 --> 09:05.410
about because she looks older than she is. She kept 
showing up in these movies, good-looking, and she

09:05.770 --> 09:10.075
was a little Jewish girl about... no more than 15 
years old, very good-looking and radiant. Can I

09:16.221 --> 09:19.524
tell a quick anecdote about that movie and that 
girl? As I indicated, he had never told me very much

09:20.145 --> 09:27.772
of anything, and would shy a hedge on any questions 
about relationships. So right after we got the job

09:28.132 --> 09:43.285
as the pro at Beaver's Racquet, the first pro 
tennis pro job in Santa Cruz County, and we started

09:28.132 --> 09:43.285
generating some social activities around this 
little membership project. One of the things we

09:43.265 --> 09:53.398
did would be to have a mixed doubles night and then 
everybody would bring a jug of wine and we'd have

09:43.265 --> 09:53.398
some food and sit around and socialize. And he 
decided he wanted to show some of these little

09:53.418 --> 09:57.884
skate movies, which I had not seen. So I'm helping 
him. We're getting the projector out and all of a

09:59.025 --> 10:06.555
sudden up here on the screen, it's repeating this 
picture of him with this girl somewhere in the

10:06.974 --> 10:16.246
group or together with her and the whole crowd and I 
really crack up because I said, who is that woman?

10:16.266 --> 10:18.069
And I've introduced other females. You see, I 
broke the rule. You see? And it can only cause

10:21.594 --> 10:23.216
trouble. It never turns out right. And her name was 
Wolf. I can't think of her name, but her name was

10:27.842 --> 10:32.008
Wolf, spelled W-O-L-F-F. Very young girl who full 
of enthusiasm for my project. She was actually

10:38.852 --> 10:41.316
volunteered to be an assistant. What are we going 
to do today, Dennis, type of thing. Show up at your

10:44.720 --> 10:46.443
door. What are we going to shoot today? What story? 
So she was a perfect foil partner for me to get

10:50.868 --> 11:05.668
involved in other projects and have a marvelous 
time making movies, which I showed on Saturday

10:50.868 --> 11:05.668
nights to hundreds of people. instructional 
movies, cartoons. They would come up, okay, let's

11:10.349 --> 11:12.652
make a cartoon. She'd make a clown costume for me so 
that I could play the clown. I would make skis out of

11:20.324 --> 11:34.626
barrel pieces, staves, nail old shoes to it so I 
could ski backwards and things like that and fall

11:20.324 --> 11:34.626
down and all the audience would just roar, you 
know? And I had bought a recorder, and I remember

11:35.112 --> 11:46.752
the songs I recorded as background music to the ski 
movies. Pergin Suite makes a marvelous downhill

11:46.872 --> 11:50.859
race. I filmed the Silver Belt, famous race of 
Trigger Boat, every year with some of the top

11:51.420 --> 11:58.652
racers in it. Did you watch a lot of movies, Lee 
Camp? Yeah, as many as we got, these Hollywood

12:02.416 --> 12:05.525
movies. Marvelous, free movies. Can't beat that. 
Did any of them stick with you? I can't think of one

12:12.440 --> 12:24.075
offhand, but you've got to know the movie stars 
that kept coming back, the faces, and the

12:12.440 --> 12:24.075
Hollywood productions were great. We didn't see 
any other, not one camp incident that you read

12:24.396 --> 12:28.941
about. They showed us the horror movies that I know 
of of these concentration camps. We never saw one

12:34.629 --> 12:36.691
of those. So we were nothing but good front movies 
playing there. We veered away from Ms. Wolf

12:41.971 --> 12:45.296
successfully. Is there anything about, you can 
say, look, I don't know anything about Wolf.

12:50.525 --> 12:51.186
Nothing whatsoever. I considered her much too 
young. Just because she looked mature and acted

12:55.192 --> 12:58.698
mature, she wasn't. She did take me to meet their 
parents in San Francisco. and they turned out to,

13:03.925 --> 13:08.290
they were engaged in some kind of political thing, 
I could tell. There was something going on, and I

13:08.490 --> 13:12.375
didn't really want to get involved. He was a 
professor of some sort at the time. It was during

13:14.297 --> 13:18.843
the era that all of the... What, McCarthyism? 
Might have been, might have been. I just, and

13:20.805 --> 13:23.248
that's only just guesswork. They were involved in 
some books and paper and all this intellectual

13:23.268 --> 13:31.097
stuff, and laying around, and here's this young, 
girl, you know, introducing me, and I believe we

13:31.432 --> 13:43.627
had dinner, and she must have told him that she had a 
lot of fun up at the Sierra Club with this guy, you

13:31.432 --> 13:43.627
know, making movies. I would assume that's the way 
to open it up. But I'm sure... If you had joined a

13:49.934 --> 13:52.818
political party, what party would you have 
joined? None. Do you feel yourself, if someone

13:54.840 --> 13:57.844
says... Yeah, the Republicans are doing this and 
that. Do you feel more akin? Yeah, I have. Someone

14:03.676 --> 14:05.641
says the Democrats are doing this and that. You 
say, gee, I would support that. Yeah, I do. I do feel

14:10.691 --> 14:13.437
about issues. something that was unknown, this 
terminology. In fact, I had a conversation with my

14:16.740 --> 14:27.351
niece as I was reading these, since I started 
reading some German newspaper that says, they

14:16.740 --> 14:27.351
still don't know how to write published 
newspapers. All they can talk about is, first of

14:27.992 --> 14:32.076
all, their words are too long. Nobody can 
understand them. And she agreed, yeah, that their

14:34.399 --> 14:37.382
sight is a, a terrible newspaper. No, it doesn't 
have to go on. No, okay. Because the words are too

14:42.074 --> 14:43.596
long. And they never have any issues. Where is the 
issue? They're looking for issues. And then get

14:48.943 --> 14:51.966
the different sides to the issue. What they have is 
a Gespräch, which is an interview. That is a one

14:56.452 --> 14:57.794
side. Well, where in the hell is the other side? Or 
what other? You know, where is the... A Gespräch is

15:02.259 --> 15:05.563
a pretty... Well, it's not a good tool to enlighten 
people. It's okay. I may be interested in what a

15:11.150 --> 15:16.798
certain person has to say, but where's the issue? 
It's the newspaper's job to dig out the issues.

15:20.143 --> 15:20.383
Yes. Which party would you find yourself with if 
you were involved in American politics? I guess

15:26.852 --> 15:30.096
I'm not going to do that. No, I don't. You're asking 
me a straight question. Just where do you... the

15:34.282 --> 15:36.224
cross-section, the ethnic thing. Very much, Gene 
and I, just without knowing, ever discussing

15:36.505 --> 15:45.496
politics prior to our marriage, we just think 
alike. One more lucky thing that happened.

15:54.287 --> 16:01.116
Let me ask you, during the times that you were a ski 
instructor, when Would the apprehension start

16:02.058 --> 16:05.504
about what you're going to do during the summer? 
About January, February, March? Are you starting

16:08.268 --> 16:10.912
to get worried about March? March, yeah. You're 
saying, I'm getting concerned. First of May is the

16:13.376 --> 16:14.318
last. I see. So first of May is the end of the season. 
Yeah. So you have to start concerning yourself

16:19.727 --> 16:22.451
with what you're going to do this summer. My God, 
how am I going to stay alive? Well, and usually I had

16:25.616 --> 16:27.880
no prospects. So I tried to save as much money, 
which wasn't very much because these jobs are

16:29.598 --> 16:41.367
low-level kind of jobs as far as money is 
concerned. Right. How would you go about

16:42.510 --> 16:45.818
preparing yourself for May 1st? I was saving as 
much as I could. And then this goes usually

16:50.597 --> 17:10.382
straight for Stockton, which is in the middle of 
the San

16:50.597 --> 17:10.382
Joaquin Valley and the agricultural community. 
So if worse came to worse, if I didn't plan to come up

17:10.402 --> 17:16.530
with anything, then I'd just jump on the truck at 5 
o'clock in the morning and go out to wherever we

17:10.402 --> 17:16.530
were, find a supply truck, work, pay home, leave. 
Was it a scary prospect to leave the security of

17:17.000 --> 17:28.446
skiing traumatic? Was there a one time in 
particular that you remember that boy, I'm not

17:32.170 --> 17:33.973
looking forward to this summer at all. I just don't 
feel good, I don't have enough money, or I'm

17:34.033 --> 17:43.826
leaving this girl, or I'm... Yeah, you have to 
leave your friendship with these beautiful

17:34.033 --> 17:43.826
girls. There was one season, you know, the one that 
I met this gal from Sacramento,

17:43.846 --> 17:51.757
and... Who was that? Pardon? Who was that? The girl 
from Sacramento? The girl from Sacramento where

17:53.339 --> 17:56.924
Bill Klein told me not to get involved. Oh, yes, 
right. Any rich girls. Psychologist.

17:59.268 --> 17:59.528
Psychologist. No, that was in Pendley Hill. The 
psychology was in Pendley Hill. She was the one

18:02.718 --> 18:12.044
that was the advertising manager for the Thailand 
Country Shopping Center in Sacramento, a brand

18:02.718 --> 18:12.044
new shopping center. And she wrote a column. the 
shopping center column about people, that they

18:13.902 --> 18:22.970
still use today, that technique, which, of 
course, was totally new to me. This merchandising

18:23.531 --> 18:34.080
technique was my first introduction to business 
advertising, an American way of doing business. I

18:34.100 --> 18:36.443
found it fascinating. And she was crazy about this 
guy. She thought he was a genius. to do all these

18:41.307 --> 18:42.789
things. And of course, I'm sure he had two or three 
Cadillacs and was a big businessman in

18:42.889 --> 18:50.677
Sacramento. So that was a tough time. That was a 
tough season for him. You have to give up this

18:52.859 --> 19:05.813
entree by being able to get into this kind of 
business world that was so fascinating and

18:52.859 --> 19:05.813
rewarding, obviously, because they were all 
driving around in fancy cars, and I probably

19:06.232 --> 19:09.836
didn't even have a car. And you were dating already 
with her? Yeah, yeah, a few dates. But it's very

19:15.603 --> 19:21.830
hard to take them out when you don't have any money. 
There's certain things to be expected, dinner,

19:22.090 --> 19:26.956
movies. So you were pretty close, and you knew that 
when summer came, when May 1st came, you'd have to

19:26.976 --> 19:30.940
leave. and you would not see her again, unless she 
showed up for the next season. Yeah, pretty much

19:35.494 --> 19:37.115
so. And so it was pretty hard to, I mean, one assumed 
that once May 1st rolled around and you started

19:37.135 --> 19:46.524
your summer work, that she wouldn't wait around. 
Chances are you wouldn't see her again the next

19:47.605 --> 19:49.887
season. Which was correct, because she didn't get 
married to some wealthy guy from Milwaukee, dear

19:50.147 --> 19:56.012
family. How did you find that out? I did meet her. 
Either I called her or she called me, and... when I

20:01.750 --> 20:04.714
was on the peninsula. That surprised me. After 
she'd gotten married, she wanted to see me, wanted

20:05.595 --> 20:08.919
to know what I was doing. How long after that? Five 
years? That was amazing that she was interested

20:13.244 --> 20:18.670
enough to... I'm trying to think, honey. I 
remember we had lunch. We met for lunch up at...

20:29.915 --> 20:34.421
fish market up at North Shore, the beach in San 
Francisco, North Beach. I remember being late for

20:35.422 --> 20:38.467
lunch and I had to apologize. We had French bread 
and the famous lunch. You were married by that time

20:44.034 --> 20:45.356
or not? No. That must have been a scary thing to have 
someone call you out of the past because you have to

20:46.758 --> 20:52.646
stop and think, what did I tell her the first time? 
What have I done since then? Well, it was getting

20:53.727 --> 20:56.311
better. I was accumulating a better... I mean, I 
had more to tell now. I had a life that I could talk

21:03.196 --> 21:05.280
about. I had a job. I was doing interesting things 
myself. So it was actually, you know, every year it

21:09.827 --> 21:12.933
was getting better. It seemed like it wasn't, but 
it was. What were you doing at that time on the

21:17.603 --> 21:19.826
peninsula? I was estimating, so it had to be after 
Herb died, and I'd already moved to, because Herb

21:19.846 --> 21:46.463
was in East Bay, Oakland, and then I got a job with 
AMCO, which had a place in Oakland, but they also

21:19.846 --> 21:46.463
had a place on the peninsula, and they transferred 
me to the peninsula across the bay, and I moved into

21:19.846 --> 21:46.463
San Mateo, and...

21:47.675 --> 22:04.337
I left them for Clark Door,

21:47.675 --> 22:04.337
which was a cabinet and pre-hung door shop, 
similar to what Earl had, only more cabinets and

21:47.675 --> 22:04.337
things. And so I worked for these Clark boys. They 
had hired me away from somebody I had been a

22:09.460 --> 22:22.913
competitor of theirs and what I would do is I would 
go to my competitors and surprisingly they would

22:09.460 --> 22:22.913
offer me jobs because I was hurting them. Sure. So 
they would say, okay, why don't you bring over your

22:24.455 --> 22:27.598
clients to mine? We need the business. We'll give 
you $15 more. What are you making? And they would up

22:32.724 --> 22:40.172
my salary a little bit, and I would bring as many 
clients as I could over to the next guy. So when

22:40.533 --> 22:51.685
somebody was hassling me or they wanted to put the 
screws to me, then I would look for a competitor and

22:40.533 --> 22:51.685
take my clients with me. Is it hard for you to leave 
people?

22:56.928 --> 23:00.733
My friends, yes, but when they put the screws to me, 
no. And can you usually find a reason why they're

23:01.394 --> 23:06.280
putting the screws to you? What I'm curious about 
is, does the decision to leave come first, and then

23:08.342 --> 23:15.631
looking for a good reason, they're hassling me? 
Remember that time they said this and this and

23:16.432 --> 23:20.997
this, and then you create, you engineer a reason to 
leave you. Does the leaving come first, or does the

23:22.023 --> 23:25.109
hassling come first? The hassling comes first. 
Oh, okay. So you begin to feel that they really are

23:27.212 --> 23:32.001
down on you for some reason? You know how 
management is. You're talking about people that

23:36.710 --> 23:41.378
know very little more than you do, are in charge of 
you. Right. So I don't, you know, and I'm also in

23:42.380 --> 23:46.427
many... cases, as Gene finally pointed out to me, 
is that I'm usually a threat to them. I usually

23:52.420 --> 23:56.185
threaten my own managers. So in those days I was 
very outspoken, and I still am, which is not very

23:57.107 --> 24:03.555
smart. I'm not skilled in the corporate gameplay. 
I read books. I try to learn like Peter's Principle

24:10.967 --> 24:14.452
and things like that. I try to get away from my 
bluntness and use more diplomacy. And Jean helps

24:21.042 --> 24:24.567
me with that a lot. But it's hard for you to leave 
people, or it's not? It just depends on how they...

24:32.118 --> 24:34.722
I want to add a little something here. To... to me, 
he has very often said or expressed his attitude

24:36.239 --> 24:47.796
that if somebody does something like that to him, 
they don't exist anymore. And I've seen him do

24:47.816 --> 24:49.078
this. They simply do not exist. I have the same 
opinion. Yeah, I could, you know, they just died.

24:57.506 --> 24:58.127
Yeah. And so there have been a lot of times when 
maybe that influenced me, too. I didn't really

25:02.136 --> 25:10.032
think that that would happen to us, but that if I did 
hassle them too much, I would not exist. Right. and

25:10.192 --> 25:35.895
i thought then when finally we got down to that 
point where i was ready that was included what was

25:10.192 --> 25:35.895
going to happen i would walk out the door and i would 
no longer exist well that wouldn't exactly have

25:10.192 --> 25:35.895
happened but the impression is this all with 
everybody or is that just the selected no this is

25:10.192 --> 25:35.895
selected to get out of the situation uh you can't 
you can't go on disliking somebody and worrying

25:36.466 --> 25:58.862
about it and you've got to get on and change get out 
of the situation and the best way is to just to leave

25:36.466 --> 25:58.862
to leave and but you never had the feeling that gee i 
wish i'd left a note or gee i wish i had sent a

25:36.466 --> 25:58.862
postcard yeah with a lot of those like i said just in 
a very with the people that are especially very,

25:59.247 --> 26:09.138
very kind to me, super sweet people, talk to a bunch 
of people that I feel bad about. But even the ones I

26:09.158 --> 26:13.944
had hassles with, I didn't really want to hassle. I 
didn't realize I was threatening anybody for

26:13.964 --> 26:17.508
their jobs. Maybe I was. I wanted to get a better 
job, true. But I didn't realize that they thought I

26:20.211 --> 26:23.695
was getting after their job. I just wanted a better 
job. But they feel always threatened. So that was

26:29.065 --> 26:31.148
news to me. Once I learned that, that helped me a 
lot. Not much. Let me ask you a question about the

26:37.317 --> 26:40.842
time you spent in Berkeley. It sounds like a very 
important period. Yes. It sounds as though you

26:44.448 --> 26:46.030
were coming out. Yes. I'm going to go downstairs. 
Yeah. That was a marvelous experience. About when

26:55.204 --> 26:56.085
was that? I

26:58.647 --> 27:11.500
was working for her at the time. Because my first 
decent job, steady

27:11.520 --> 27:26.535
job,

27:11.520 --> 27:26.535
steady paycheck, none of us worrying about the 
summer and winter. So I had to be 53, 54 at the time

27:26.555 --> 27:28.317
slot. And so Herb played tennis, not as much as I 
did, because he worried about his business on

27:29.562 --> 27:41.036
Saturday.

27:41.056 --> 27:46.543
He'd go

27:41.056 --> 27:46.543
in and work a few hours. And I would go in once in a 
while, but not all the time. And on these courts, I

27:48.465 --> 27:58.177
met all these foreign students or ex-students 
that stayed over.

27:58.197 --> 27:58.978
Lowell Welsh. these guys that hang around the 
tennis courts. Right. Put me in that place. You are

28:07.911 --> 28:11.276
living in Berkeley, or are you living around 
Berkeley? Could I just go for the thing? Oh, sure,

28:14.940 --> 28:16.442
sure. Now it's on. Okay. Let me ask you about 
Berkeley. That sounds like an important period.

28:20.648 --> 28:21.489
Very. First of all, it had all the ingredients 
of... early Greek and its freedom of expression,

28:25.570 --> 28:32.591
symposiums.

28:35.039 --> 28:38.770
I had some, you know, I could talk about those 
things a little bit, because I had known about, I

28:40.353 --> 28:58.396
had heard about Greeks, I had the history, and I 
knew what symposium meant, and I knew what freedom

28:40.353 --> 28:58.396
of expression meant, and standing up, and having, 
voicing your opinion. How did you find yourself in

28:58.416 --> 29:01.320
Berkeley?

29:06.627 --> 29:09.330
I had tried San Francisco, and Of course, I checked 
out, I'm constantly checking out, looking for

29:09.682 --> 29:13.227
places. And I had liked Berkeley. As soon as I drove 
into town, or rather the bus came into town, Lake

29:17.332 --> 29:23.600
Merritt is right in the middle, lovely place. And 
the people, it's more residential, less business

29:23.620 --> 29:30.750
oriented, the downtown area. And I had a good 
feeling about the town. And, of course, I think it

29:36.192 --> 29:42.602
must have been with Herb, because Herb was in East 
Oakland on 33rd Street. That was my first job on

29:43.464 --> 29:48.312
that side of the bay. And I had been there, through 
there, because Berkeley is on that side. And these

29:51.918 --> 29:56.565
people lived there, the director of the Sierra 
Club. Oh, someone's coming.

30:05.892 --> 30:07.316
How much time do we have here? So you're in 
Berkeley. You came in by bus.

30:21.012 --> 30:29.366
Herb said, I got a car, company kind of car I could 
use to go make calls with. And like I say, the first

30:29.987 --> 30:36.479
two weeks I had this accident with it, practically 
demolished the whole front end of it. Well, that

30:36.599 --> 30:38.081
was the old Plymouth. Yeah, the old Plymouth. 
Yeah. And... So I had the whole territory, the

30:41.482 --> 30:58.494
whole Bay Area, which is five million people, that 
I, he says, I don't, after the first week of looking

30:41.482 --> 30:58.494
around in the shop for how we manufacture this 
product, he says, you can get out and find some

30:41.482 --> 30:58.494
work. I need the work. Right. I got all these doors 
here. We got to sell them. Right. didn't really

31:04.415 --> 31:12.765
give me a few hints as to where to go, who to see, you 
know, and the rest of it is up to you. I just started

31:12.785 --> 31:25.840
to prowl the area for jobs, and I developed an eye 
for any kind of raw lumber within my vision. When I

31:26.021 --> 31:31.367
see a two by four, I know there has to be some 
construction going on. And I enjoyed that very

31:31.921 --> 31:34.007
much. Just this independence, this freedom. 
Nobody hassling you while you're out looking. And

31:39.301 --> 31:41.307
the searching was part of my The prowling around 
for something was part of my makeup anyway. So it

31:47.082 --> 31:52.767
fell right into my moving, not standing still and 
waiting to be discovered. Yes. The flight almost

31:53.869 --> 31:57.592
like a salesman is a hunter itself. Yes, I see that 
too. To find jobs. Yeah, to find jobs. So that fell

32:02.717 --> 32:04.539
right into it. So I was successful from the 
beginning. He was always amazed at the new jobs

32:10.042 --> 32:14.567
that I would find. How did you run into Turk and 
these people? So then, on weekends, I lived in the

32:18.183 --> 32:41.162
middle of town, which is between, the job was in 
East Oakland, I lived in Lake Merritt in a boarding

32:18.183 --> 32:41.162
house, and always looking, finding things, 
where's tennis courts, checked out Davies

32:18.183 --> 32:41.162
Stadium, the one that's in Merritt, Lake Merritt, 
it's a city-run place, and I was very cliquish, I

32:18.183 --> 32:41.162
could not get in, very well. They played with each 
other, and the tennis players were very cliquish.

32:47.051 --> 32:54.221
I got to play a little bit, but not enough, so I was 
looking for other courts. Found some in Alameda,

32:54.481 --> 32:59.128
friendly people, the Irish people.

33:03.555 --> 33:05.277
He became national ranked, was on the Davis Cup 
team. He'd just been returned from the, he was

33:09.627 --> 33:17.438
junior champion, and I met his mother and father, 
they were running his courts. They took me in,

33:17.658 --> 33:22.365
played some tennis in Alameda, which is a 
peninsula there. But I remember distinctly in

33:23.967 --> 33:26.370
those days, that cars were driving all around 
these courts, that I had difficulty serving,

33:26.941 --> 33:40.182
because when you served, I had to take my eyes off 
the traffic, if you can imagine watching the

33:26.941 --> 33:40.182
traffic while playing tennis. And it always has 
bothered me to take my eye... Off the ball. Off the

33:47.073 --> 33:49.157
traffic, off my surroundings. Because at that 
time, I felt very... and I have difficulty. I

33:55.496 --> 34:02.212
wanted to be able, I wanted to play and see is there a 
car parked over there, is there somebody watching

33:55.496 --> 34:02.212
me, that kind of thing. When did you live at Black 
Mirror? What year was that? In the early part. What

34:07.985 --> 34:09.148
year? Did I ever

34:09.854 --> 34:31.643
tell you that in 1959 I lived on Bandana Boulevard 
about four or five blocks from where we're

34:09.854 --> 34:31.643
driving? It never stops, does it? So a

34:37.705 --> 34:44.537
lot of it is just moving around. One man down in 
Boulevard, Mr. Bob Lake Merritt, and he's talking

34:44.557 --> 34:53.192
about a groovy house that was right in that... 
Manzanito. Manzanita? Manzanita. What's that?

34:58.343 --> 34:58.864
Tree or? Manzanita. Manzanita. And I lived on Man 
Man. Yeah, had to be very close. I don't know. I

35:08.044 --> 35:08.765
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So you got in 
with a bunch of Berkeley students? Students,

35:14.022 --> 35:15.627
yeah. And these guys that hang around are 
regulars. One of them, good player, and very

35:18.435 --> 35:25.255
German-looking with a very German name, Lowell 
Welch. And he took a liking to me, and I took a liking

35:27.108 --> 35:31.554
to him. And then Ed Christian, who was obviously 
Swedish, was also a good player and liked to play

35:31.574 --> 35:37.942
with me. I gave him a good match. He was an executive 
for the telephone company. And also a skier. He

35:44.109 --> 35:46.112
knew me from skiing, so I had an in. Because the same 
people that play tennis in the Berkeley courts

35:46.913 --> 35:51.058
also were skiers. The more affluent people, very 
athletic. And that person knew me, had seen me at

35:56.909 --> 36:00.755
Sugar Bowl. So he was a bachelor. And we almost 
became friends to some degree. You know, I just

36:08.666 --> 36:14.495
kind of kept my distance because I either didn't 
have any money or whatever. But he did invite me to

36:14.515 --> 36:25.110
his place up at Tahoe a few times, opening and 
closing his chalet, driving his convertible to

36:14.515 --> 36:25.110
Tahoe. And these students now, then the old Welsh, 
who took me to meet his family, his wife. And he was a

36:35.893 --> 36:39.518
strange one. He had these paraplegic children. 
Oh, yes, right. But he was always looking for girls

36:45.006 --> 36:48.010
for some reason. But he was very shy and a very 
complex person, really. He was not really a threat

36:51.115 --> 36:54.540
to anybody, but he would always chase some... He 
was a looker. I don't know what you call it. He

36:57.308 --> 37:01.313
wouldn't really do anything about it because he 
had a little speech problem. He stammered. So he

37:04.016 --> 37:06.399
got right up to it, and then he couldn't speak. Oh, 
yeah, he would hang around the Rose dancing. He

37:10.304 --> 37:11.345
would go dancing. He was a marvelous dancer. And 
although he was married with three children, he

37:13.868 --> 37:17.313
would go dancing to the Rose. Did you ever go 
dancing to him? Yeah, he took me to the Rose. I've

37:21.658 --> 37:23.380
got to tell you this. Maybe I didn't. I know I did. I 
told you about the time when I was working in

37:26.828 --> 37:33.757
Berkeley, and I went to apply for a job. I needed 
extra money. I had a job, and I needed extra money.

37:37.803 --> 37:43.331
And one of the gals that worked with me was when I was 
on Mandan. I worked for this small company down in

37:43.351 --> 37:45.874
Portland, Alabama. We went to the Rose Room 
ballroom to apply to be a dance hostess. And the

37:51.403 --> 37:57.513
only reason I didn't get the job was because I 
couldn't afford the evening dance that you had to

37:51.403 --> 37:57.513
buy. So I never really got it. Because you saw a 
couple of shady characters standing nearby. Very

38:01.259 --> 38:03.563
fair. They sell their tickets. Ten cents a dance. 
So then this Turk would come around. His name was

38:14.687 --> 38:16.069
Sadat Sermon. Sadat Sermon. Sadat Sermon. We 
called him Sid. And a real charmer with the boys.

38:25.041 --> 38:26.523
He'd come, always new balls. He was the only one 
that had new balls every time. And tell these tales

38:30.849 --> 38:34.593
about his girlfriends. We would always beat him 
badly, six-love, six-one. And he says, oh, I'm too

38:38.504 --> 38:39.806
tired. I had this last night. Yeah, right. And he's 
fat and orgy or whatever he is. And Lowell and I

38:45.034 --> 38:48.879
would look at each other and say, this, we want to 
find out. Sure. How does he do that? He was telling

38:52.144 --> 38:56.611
us he just had a divorce, but he spent the night with 
his ex-girl. But he had this other girl over there

38:57.111 --> 39:00.216
and another one over there. And he met some nurses. 
And he, I mean, he was just, you know, our eyes were

39:01.658 --> 39:06.144
just like this. So. And he says, okay, let's go to 
Laval's and have some beer and pizza. And it

39:14.871 --> 39:19.238
started to rain, and okay, let's go down there, 
fine. And we'd order something, and we'd count our

39:21.621 --> 39:29.854
money a little bit, you know, we can't, never mind, 
never mind, just bring that over here, here, you

39:21.621 --> 39:29.854
know, pick up the check. Hey, I mean, he was just... 
We thought he had an oil well or something. He was a

39:34.959 --> 39:38.805
rich student from Iran. I guess it was back then. It 
doesn't exist anymore. Changed oil. Changed oil.

39:48.182 --> 39:54.192
And we knew his father was a minister of some kind. 
One day, Lowell told me, you know, I found out where

39:54.863 --> 40:01.872
Sadat lives. He would never tell us where he lives. 
I always moved around. I stayed there with my

40:04.636 --> 40:06.098
ex-wife. These are really your kind of people, 
then. Yeah. They're moving from one place to the

40:08.801 --> 40:10.243
other. They've got nicknames and mysterious 
rooms. Yeah, I fit right in. It's a very safe place

40:15.470 --> 40:17.072
to be. Yeah, yeah. So Lowell said, I found out where 
he lives. Let's go bust in on him. That's the reason

40:24.081 --> 40:24.702
why. I followed. We found a nice new apartment 
building. And we knocked on his door. He says, I've

40:32.466 --> 40:34.529
seen him go in there. I've seen him go in there with 
groceries. We all had followed him. And we knocked

40:39.016 --> 40:41.920
on the door. Finally, somebody answered. This 
girl, I guess, who are you? Just kind of stammered

40:47.108 --> 40:48.430
around. I guess I had to do the talking. And he was 
looking for Sid. I said, oh, Sid, he's not here

40:52.836 --> 40:56.101
right now. He may be back in an hour. Would you care 
to wait? Yeah. So she just walked in and sat down and

41:02.049 --> 41:04.813
we talked. You know, what is this? She just maybe 
brought out some potato chips.

41:11.262 --> 41:12.964
And we waited for Sid. When he came in, I think he 
almost had a heart attack. What are you guys doing

41:16.524 --> 41:19.528
here? As it turned out, he did not want his women are 
put away somewhere and they are not to have any

41:19.968 --> 41:30.782
contact with anybody. So anyway, we wanted to know 
his method of how he was so successful. And we

41:36.269 --> 41:42.057
studied, believe me, we begged him for 
information.

41:43.117 --> 41:51.642
he revealed everything that they were taught as 
boys in Iran, you know, wherever he was from. And

41:52.465 --> 41:54.387
all these rules that you have to have. Do not talk 
about other girls in front of your girlfriend. And

41:58.972 --> 42:02.577
I did that, and I got walled out. And you do not try to 
stash him away and get his little contact with the

42:03.478 --> 42:08.724
outside world. So you keep him quiet. Stash him 
away. Stash him away somewhere. I understand all

42:13.449 --> 42:15.532
that. You understand all that, see? And, you know, 
he came in with two bags of groceries. Always be

42:19.876 --> 42:22.698
generous, you know, with that. Of course, Lowell 
and I, neither one knew how to be generous. We

42:26.701 --> 42:32.926
didn't have any money, but it wasn't even part of 
our makeup, you know, to be that generous. Yeah,

42:32.946 --> 42:34.147
yeah, that generous. And so now that we found him, 
so he couldn't very well throw us out. So we started

42:39.612 --> 42:41.834
to have good fun. And Dorothy, what was her name? 
She now had some company. And she found it

42:46.718 --> 42:55.571
entertaining that somebody, while she was 
waiting for Sadat, who was maybe sleeping with

42:46.718 --> 42:55.571
some other girls, you know. Which she was not aware 
of. No, no. He would call her, no matter where he

42:58.776 --> 43:04.044
was, that he couldn't make it, you know, he was tied 
up or something. And so we learned all these things

43:04.945 --> 43:10.614
that we knew nothing about, as to how to brainwash 
these girls. Right. You know what I'm saying? Did

43:14.427 --> 43:18.211
he ever cut you in on some of these things? We asked 
to. Yeah, we could have, but he traveled in other

43:19.592 --> 43:22.195
company. He was tied up with his boss. He was 
supplying his boss with girls, you see, and set up

43:24.758 --> 43:42.797
these things, which in turn meant he had a fabulous 
job with a guy who evidently was in there by then

43:24.758 --> 43:42.797
because he was the founder of the MasterCard.

43:44.448 --> 43:46.510
That guy sounds like a pimp, if you want my honest 
opinion. Yeah, but also he knew money, how to make

43:46.830 --> 43:50.314
money, you know? Right, but a classy one, right. 
Yeah, classy. I think in that culture, he's... No,

43:52.977 --> 43:56.120
it's not considered... I don't mean to say... So I 
always... So you were really a drop-in that these

43:59.944 --> 44:04.929
guys all attended school, or no? No, he had 
probably overstayed his visa by then. Probably

44:08.413 --> 44:09.854
was an illegal alien. And Lowell was a student? 
Lowell? No, he dropped out a long time ago. He just

44:14.847 --> 44:15.811
hung around. But he was an excellent tennis 
player. So you'd hang around in the student union?

44:20.813 --> 44:22.255
or the university part? Nothing to do with the 
university. No, that would scare me. I'd walk

44:24.658 --> 44:27.082
through it just to see the buildings. So it was just 
living in Berkeley. See, when I see the word

44:28.203 --> 44:30.166
Berkeley, I think of the university. Yeah, I walk 
through, and I like to be near it. And I like to see

44:32.690 --> 44:38.077
the trees, and the kids, and walking with their 
books, and all that. And I was probably very

44:38.097 --> 44:42.484
jealous that I couldn't go to university. But I 
didn't see a way to get in. But how long did you spend

44:44.987 --> 44:46.990
in Berkeley? Probably three or four years. Three 
or four years? No, so this is a very... Yeah, it was a

44:50.805 --> 44:57.037
very stimulated period. And these same people 
were with you all that period? Yeah. Turk and

45:00.144 --> 45:04.793
Lowell and... Lowell and then George Dufort and 
Christian... The telephone executive. George

45:09.137 --> 45:10.299
Dufort? George Dufort, who later became the 
assistant district attorney up at Plastic

45:10.319 --> 45:17.168
County. Right, he's the one who was your... At our 
wedding. At the wedding. Dufort, F-O-R-D?

45:23.357 --> 45:27.062
D-U-F-O-R-T.

45:23.357 --> 45:27.062
T-U-F? No, D-U-F-O-R-T. D-U-F-O-R-T, got it. 
very handsome. He went on to become the district

45:34.791 --> 45:36.634
attorney? Assistant. He was assistant to the DA 
when we were there. Did that concern you? A little

45:42.124 --> 45:48.094
bit, because I assumed they'd see the pictures and 
they have, you know, i wouldn't get all the

45:49.103 --> 46:17.372
pictures but they are certainly in law 
enforcement or somewhere sure and so i was but

45:49.103 --> 46:17.372
somehow george was also a very he wasn't he wasn't 
that kind of a guy he was he wasn't by the book he's

45:49.103 --> 46:17.372
had his own problem he was too good looking you know 
and so and we had a by that time i felt there was a

45:49.103 --> 46:17.372
diversion there that he wouldn't associated me 
with any of this because of my tennis.
