WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:09.628
Understandably it was Indiana University which had had since post-World War II a counseling service.

00:09.648 --> 00:16.268
It started really because of the VA benefits that was the need for that and so that was a very established center so a lot of my

00:16.619 --> 00:22.187
thoughts and ideas came out of that one because that was a Big Ten school and it was a large center and it provided a model.

00:22.547 --> 00:28.015
Plus then what I had experienced then moving into an administrative position with a smaller staff at East Texas.

00:28.536 --> 00:31.981
Those two, but primarily Indiana University was the guidance.

00:32.522 --> 00:37.188
How did you become well acquainted with Texas A&M for better or for worse?

00:38.109 --> 00:45.580
I remember my remembrance of A&M had been principally watching the football game against University of Texas.

00:46.015 --> 01:01.655
And I had heard of the Corps of Cadets tangently, and I'd heard of the school spirit tangently, but not seriously, because I'll be honest, when I came to Texas, I was planning to just spend a few years here and get back to Florida.

01:02.977 --> 01:04.479
And that was 30 years ago.

01:06.061 --> 01:09.986
So really, it was mostly through the football game.

01:10.066 --> 01:15.533
And then I heard John talk about how if he could have another position in student affairs,

01:15.968 --> 01:21.490
A&M was where he wanted to be because of the quality of the kids that he had met from A&M.

01:22.293 --> 01:27.092
Alright, and then did you do any homework to learn about it?

01:27.646 --> 01:29.689
No, I really honestly didn't.

01:29.709 --> 01:30.670
I frankly didn't.

01:30.910 --> 01:36.317
All I was, again, tipped off by these outsiders that it's a conservative environment.

01:36.337 --> 01:37.318
You better check it out.

01:37.439 --> 01:40.142
Make sure you're comfortable there because it's a different kind of place.

01:40.362 --> 01:45.709
And that's why I did the thing of stopping people with mustaches and beards and seeing if they were being harassed.

01:45.729 --> 01:46.991
And you got here what time of the year?

01:47.812 --> 01:50.175
Got here, reported here on August 1st, 1974.

01:50.295 --> 01:52.918
And I'm sure it was nice and cool.

01:52.939 --> 01:54.300
Oh, yeah.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.662
What kind of housing did you find?

01:56.148 --> 02:04.120
I was single at that point and I found I lived in like I guess it's still Briar Oaks across from the shopping center.

02:04.861 --> 02:09.909
I quickly decided I was leaving there because the morning of the Texas Tech game at 6 a.m.

02:10.409 --> 02:14.796
some Aggie got out there and started blowing the bugle at 6 a.m.

02:14.816 --> 02:23.929
and I decided I need to be in a more mature adult place so I went out to the Oaks way out on a 2818 the West Bypass which was off the shuttle bus route.

02:24.030 --> 02:25.632
I was advised that that was a good way to

02:26.033 --> 02:29.178
to try to find more adult people to live with.

02:30.380 --> 02:34.086
Describe what it was like as a new resident of this area.

02:34.106 --> 02:39.115
How did you get into the community, make friends, and so forth?

02:39.315 --> 02:46.066
I remember it as being somewhat difficult the first six months.

02:47.448 --> 02:52.176
The thing that got me integrated here and made me begin feeling rooted

02:52.679 --> 03:00.447
was I was teaching in the Department of Educational Psychology and met a number of faculty over there, and we all happened to like softball.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.268
And we got up a team.

03:02.609 --> 03:11.417
And prior to that, I had been going back to Commerce about every third or fourth weekend because Commerce had just an interesting culture of its own.

03:12.378 --> 03:18.484
And I know John used to talk with me about, Wade, you really need to be cutting back on those ties up there.

03:18.835 --> 03:21.679
You know, and he was right in establishing relationships here.

03:22.120 --> 03:26.486
But honest to goodness, it was through softball, and that sounds crazy.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.109
Who were some of the first key friends you made?

03:29.910 --> 03:38.823
Michael Ash, who was, he at one time, I think, he was assistant dean of the College of Ed for a while, and I think head of the department at some point.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.944
He's been here a long time.

03:40.565 --> 03:46.834
Yeah, Mike Ash, Bill Nash, Dick McGill, who's subsequently gone to LSU as a professor.

03:47.303 --> 03:50.393
Tom Petras was in educational curriculum and instruction.

03:50.453 --> 03:57.415
Yeah, those were probably the early, plus people in student affairs.

03:57.817 --> 04:03.686
And what were some of the first important campus activities you remember attending that fall?

04:04.046 --> 04:06.410
Oh, right away to a football game.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.795
And I remember vividly, I didn't have anything maroon when I came here.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.099
And I remember going to the first ball, I bought season tickets right away.

04:13.600 --> 04:19.048
I remember going to the first ball game and it was a little cool, it was, for that time of year it was

04:19.484 --> 04:21.107
or maybe this was about the third game of the year.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.209
There was a little cool snap.

04:22.830 --> 04:27.299
And I only had a Florida State jacket, which was dark, almost a maroon.

04:27.900 --> 04:33.871
And I remember sort of folding the lapel over to cover up the Florida State, but it was the right color.

04:34.592 --> 04:40.243
And I remember John Koldis introducing me to Margaret Rudder, and I remember holding that flap...

04:40.223 --> 04:41.045
Dearly.

04:41.826 --> 04:44.091
So, you know, that I wouldn't seem disloyal.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.037
I just didn't have anything else maroon at that point, you know.

04:47.919 --> 04:51.607
That was one of the things I really did.

04:52.890 --> 04:54.112
I went to Silver Taps.

04:55.616 --> 04:56.798
What was your impression?

04:56.778 --> 04:58.600
Several times.

04:59.661 --> 05:02.144
Oh, I just took my breath away.

05:04.748 --> 05:10.875
That that kind of reverence was displayed for fellow students, fellow Aggies and that.

05:11.095 --> 05:13.298
I'd never seen anything like that.

05:13.518 --> 05:18.064
I'm asking what I don't mean to sound like a goofy question, but I bet it is.

05:18.744 --> 05:21.688
For you as a professional counselor,

05:22.799 --> 05:28.147
What value does that kind of an event have?

05:29.349 --> 05:44.371
Haskell, I'm thoroughly convinced that part of the reason that we have a low suicide rate here is the kind of caring that A&M people have for each other.

05:45.353 --> 05:51.422
The culture clearly supports that.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.697
tend to watch out for each other.

05:54.198 --> 06:03.491
I hate to pick out a school like Wayne State University in Detroit, but I can't imagine a large urban commuter institution having that support base.

06:04.953 --> 06:09.759
Those are the conditions under which people get lost and do kill themselves.

06:11.442 --> 06:17.730
Just here in the counseling service, the thousands of students that have been brought here by a fellow student because they're worried about them,

06:18.065 --> 06:27.885
I'm convinced that that camaraderie and that caring is... So not only is it a fine tradition, it is also a very healthy... Oh, yeah.

06:27.905 --> 06:36.141
And it's interesting, you know, just leaping forward to the bonfire tragedy, it's like a double-edged sword.

06:36.577 --> 06:40.164
You have the tremendous support which students displayed for each other.

06:40.604 --> 06:46.355
On the other hand, because everyone is so close, when you do have pain, I think it is even much deeper.

06:46.816 --> 06:52.847
But then again, you have the counterbalancing support that's much stronger to help you get you out of that pain.

06:53.435 --> 06:56.060
Right, so you went to TAPS.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.403
What else did you do?

06:57.543 --> 07:03.876
Oh, I went to midnight Yale practice and couldn't believe some of the grody stories.

07:03.896 --> 07:08.426
That was sort of the direct opposite of the Silver TAPS experience.

07:08.546 --> 07:10.650
Wow, these are some stories.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.273
I laughed at them, but there was some story.

07:12.313 --> 07:13.555
What about the football game?

07:13.836 --> 07:14.097
Yeah.

07:14.217 --> 07:16.080
You knew something about athletic traditions.

07:16.120 --> 07:16.461
Yes.

07:17.102 --> 07:21.530
What about here compared to... Well, I noticed how orchestrated everything was.

07:23.454 --> 07:25.518
That was the first thing that jumped out at me.

07:25.778 --> 07:33.533
And I quickly thought, of course, being an old history major, I guess you might think this way, but I thought...

07:34.070 --> 07:43.762
how wonderful it was that an 80-year-old guy could come back to a football game, and when the yell leaders gave a hand signal, they knew what the cheer was.

07:43.862 --> 07:47.387
Whereas at Florida State and Indiana, cheers come and go.

07:47.427 --> 07:52.453
And here, and gosh, I think that threat is so important.

07:52.733 --> 07:53.274
I really do.

07:53.334 --> 08:02.305
Now, I will also say, while I was very positive about all these things, I did feel the conservatism, and it felt...

08:03.365 --> 08:05.107
There was a downside of that, too.

08:05.748 --> 08:12.318
When I went to Florida State and Indiana, nobody ever got up in my face and said, well, you're a Hoosier now, you know, by God.

08:12.999 --> 08:15.062
Those were more live and let live campuses.

08:15.162 --> 08:19.408
Here it was either, you know, you're going to be or you're going to be outside.

08:19.768 --> 08:30.283
And so some of that, little of that was negative to me, but overwhelmingly it's very positive.

08:30.348 --> 08:50.447
All right, then as you go to the office, describe some of the experiences, some of the realities you began to encounter that helped you to understand what the task here was going to be like.

08:50.467 --> 08:50.767
Yeah.

08:51.427 --> 08:59.595
Well, you know, the first thing is kind of mild in the sense that college students are college students are college students.

08:59.980 --> 09:16.523
A lot of the things that students were presenting us with were not too different from the other campuses other than the anxiety and stress and sometimes depression from academic competition I thought were a little more severe here.

09:18.365 --> 09:19.627
The kids were competing.

09:19.687 --> 09:29.380
I mean, I heard stories of people stealing somebody else's notes to prevent them from setting the curve in the class and that level of competitiveness, you know.

09:30.018 --> 09:43.875
So a lot of the, even today, a lot of the problems, relationship problems with mom and dad, roommates, boyfriend, girlfriend, problems with professors, tend to seem to be universal and unending.

09:44.596 --> 09:54.709
But I sort of felt that some of the academic competition, the competitiveness, was somewhat...

09:55.837 --> 09:57.258
more exaggerated here.

09:57.719 --> 10:05.266
I noticed or I perceived a difference like in student drinking profiles at Indiana University.

10:06.447 --> 10:15.596
People would go to the college bars and you know, but I quickly became aware that Thursday night was a big thing here.

10:15.636 --> 10:22.823
It was like the drinking episode spiked and people really blew off steam and let it go.

10:23.478 --> 10:28.383
Whereas I hadn't been aware of that on the other campuses I had worked on, so that was a little different.

10:30.325 --> 10:39.194
Nationwide, and we saw it here too, students have been bringing increasing degrees of psychopathology with them.

10:39.895 --> 10:42.698
Most of us in the business attribute it to the unhealthy family.

10:43.419 --> 10:50.346
If you could cure one thing that would put us out of business, it would be a healthier mom and dad and family situation.

10:50.326 --> 10:59.700
So we began seeing the advent of more serious psychopathology, people who already had a history of psychiatric care.

11:01.122 --> 11:04.888
There were marital, I mean, there were some people sleeping around with each other.

11:04.928 --> 11:08.894
I remember one case, we had the diagram who was sleeping with who.

11:09.475 --> 11:11.177
It got very entangled and meshed.

11:11.197 --> 11:13.120
It was hard to ferret out.

11:13.962 --> 11:18.949
Now, I'm assuming that in the 70s, drugs were seldom, if ever,

11:19.216 --> 11:20.197
a reality then.

11:20.278 --> 11:23.823
Yeah, they were not as prominent at all.

11:24.183 --> 11:29.651
And I mean, overconsumption of beer here at A&M always has been an issue of concern.

11:29.712 --> 11:34.038
But yeah, but the other illicit drugs were not as big a deal.

11:34.338 --> 11:34.819
That's right.

11:35.200 --> 11:35.640
That's right.

11:36.442 --> 11:43.993
And surely there must have been some trademark goofy, Aggie-only realities you encountered early.

11:44.594 --> 11:46.236
Well, I was...

11:46.604 --> 11:52.073
I happened to have been in a fraternity, so I was a little taken back when it was such an anti-fraternity sentiment.

11:52.133 --> 12:00.988
I remember in the first football games I went to, the Sigma Phi Epsilon would hang a banner over and the campus police would quickly come and snatch that banner.

12:01.048 --> 12:09.102
And I remember my own national fraternity when they found out I came to A&M, which was considered a plumb of an institution to try to colonize.

12:09.655 --> 12:13.279
and them writing to me and saying, can't you do anything?

12:13.299 --> 12:14.080
Can't you get started?

12:14.521 --> 12:19.706
And the first couple of years I was here, I said, hey, the environment here is not conducive to this kind of thing.

12:19.867 --> 12:20.327
What's yours?

12:21.028 --> 12:21.108
Huh?

12:21.128 --> 12:21.569
What is yours?

12:21.589 --> 12:22.309
Pi Kappa Phi.

12:22.770 --> 12:26.674
Yeah, which is a southern fraternity, southern roots.

12:26.975 --> 12:30.138
And so I dissuaded them for a while.

12:30.238 --> 12:35.224
They finally got a Presbyterian minister who was Pi Kappa Phi here to

12:35.660 --> 12:39.547
to start going and then I worked along with him and was an advisor for 15 years.

12:40.810 --> 12:43.395
But I remember that was very different.

12:44.416 --> 12:52.512
What was the, as far as you could tell, what was the campus leadership opinion about Greek organizations when you first got here?

12:52.532 --> 12:53.213
Early on?

12:53.429 --> 12:58.757
Oh, I think it was at best neutral and clearly pretty negative.

12:59.498 --> 13:04.986
Yeah, and I really, you know, from the perspective of the culture of A&M, you know, it makes sense.

13:05.066 --> 13:05.968
I can understand that.

13:07.109 --> 13:14.660
Did you, in those early experiences, did you have many Corps members come over for advising?

13:15.682 --> 13:17.244
Yeah, we did.

13:17.605 --> 13:21.991
And, of course, the military and psychology have always had an uneasy relationship.

13:22.011 --> 13:22.592
And...

13:23.095 --> 13:33.468
But, yes, we did get cadets who were sometimes brought over by their fellow cadets, which was, you know, I was astoundingly positive.

13:34.109 --> 13:39.136
Others who would come here and look both ways before they would come into the Y building or later here.

13:41.098 --> 13:43.361
But, yeah, they definitely did.

13:43.381 --> 13:46.966
We had a satellite office once over in the cadet corps area, but that did not pan out.

13:46.986 --> 13:48.989
That was too close for them to be seen.

13:49.690 --> 13:52.393
And, you know, military, even I have good friends in the Air Force, and

13:52.660 --> 13:58.182
And the enlisted people make use of psychological services, but the officers do not because it's going to go down on their record.

13:58.242 --> 14:02.198
So that was much the same thing that I think the fear here was.

14:02.735 --> 14:09.926
But you haven't mentioned any of these that were almost like, I know you're not going to believe this, but here's early on.

14:11.008 --> 14:25.992
Oh, well, you know, honestly, the thing that I, when I got here, the Aggie women don't get pregnant, and here's a weird kid who can't study, you know, concentrate on something because he broke up with his girlfriend.

14:26.528 --> 14:33.901
Those blew me away because, you know, whenever you're in one business and the lay public says something to you, you know, I'm sure I do the same thing.

14:33.941 --> 14:37.567
But those things just captured my attention just initially.

14:37.627 --> 14:48.165
I mean, A&M just was not psychologically minded at that time and was barely ready to have people like us come on campus.

14:48.550 --> 14:55.497
And you had to always let them know that the thing we were trying to do was help these kids graduate.

14:55.517 --> 14:58.401
That's why we were here, not to just do counseling.

14:58.861 --> 15:01.904
We wanted to see them get the degree that they came here to get.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.047
And that was our whole reason for being.

15:04.387 --> 15:06.029
So you really had to lay on that heavily.

15:07.550 --> 15:11.875
No, I mean those kinds of initial comments and experiences and then

15:12.175 --> 15:23.353
And then looking at some of the traditions, both extremely positive and then some of the negative part of feeling like, boy, you better be part of this or you're an outsider.

15:23.513 --> 15:24.775
Highway 6 runs both ways.

15:24.895 --> 15:34.150
And I think A&M, my reflection is A&M still has an extremely strong value system.

15:34.703 --> 15:37.828
But I think it's more tolerant and accepting of outsiders.

15:38.990 --> 15:41.394
And, you know, I have to think that's very good.

15:42.055 --> 15:43.096
I really do.

15:44.879 --> 15:52.451
And did you ever, in those early months, have any feeling, uh-oh, I made a mistake, I'm in the wrong place?

15:52.471 --> 15:53.092
No.

15:53.112 --> 15:54.354
So you felt good about it?

15:54.374 --> 16:02.247
Yeah, I felt it quickly became evident to me that at this university, it's esprit de corps,

16:02.986 --> 16:08.695
And it's fiscal underpinning that anything was possible at A&M.

16:09.276 --> 16:12.401
And when you're at East Texas State, things are not possible.

16:13.423 --> 16:21.095
And during those early months, who were the people that gave you pats on the back, encouragement, and so forth?

16:21.136 --> 16:24.501
Who were the... Coldus, obviously.

16:24.541 --> 16:26.344
Coldus' style was...

16:26.712 --> 16:38.066
I noticed it with any new department he'd really focus on you that first year or so and get positions to you and get you off and running and then he'd sort of let you go and he'd move on to a new person.

16:38.126 --> 16:42.411
So John was absolutely the key individual.

16:43.612 --> 16:50.741
Got a good amount of support from residence life people, from Toby Reeves, the former dean of women.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.344
She was very psychologically minded and

16:53.898 --> 17:06.758
And I think it was more Residence Life and the Department of Student Affairs where you got most of your support from, because they were also making a lot of referrals to you too.

17:07.098 --> 17:14.209
They had been among the groups that had been hurting here on campus when there was no personal counseling service.

17:14.229 --> 17:22.842
And by the way, that reminds me, in 73 when John asked me to write that proposal, I do know, and I think I still have the documents,

17:23.311 --> 17:31.839
There was a student government committee that petitioned the university for the development of counseling services.

17:32.620 --> 17:40.367
And at the same time, there was a quasi-faculty staff committee that also requested that the institution develop these.

17:40.447 --> 17:51.698
So it was a convergence of faculty, staff, and student requests upon Coldest coming here that also motivated John, in addition to his own personal experience.

17:52.184 --> 18:06.678
As you proceeded then, you didn't run into any obstacles, big obstacles, to your being able to carry out the plan that you had written in the first place.

18:06.758 --> 18:07.939
Yes, no, no.

18:08.059 --> 18:19.170
A&M, the people, I mean, I don't, Lord knows, I'll never know what people said privately or, you know, out of my earshot or what, but I never...

18:19.403 --> 18:30.057
I never was involved in a conversation where somebody implied or told me directly, hey, you need to put a cap on that service, you need to stop this.

18:30.838 --> 18:34.622
I never, never had that happen to me in Texas A&M.

18:34.643 --> 18:36.885
So you're saying no regent, no politician?

18:37.186 --> 18:38.948
Nope.

18:38.928 --> 18:49.021
John Coldis used to advise us in the Division of Student Affairs to be very careful of Board of Regents members, people with power, that they could co-opt you very quickly.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.646
And they were people of power, and you better be very careful.

18:53.287 --> 18:55.730
His thing was, let me handle those politics.

18:56.110 --> 18:57.272
You keep your nose clean.

18:57.352 --> 19:00.596
And I didn't have any problem following that guidance.

19:01.017 --> 19:06.724
So I was never... There were a couple of occasions where a board member would call,

19:07.261 --> 19:13.152
And I remember several of the presidents telling us that whenever that happened they wanted a report of it.

19:13.172 --> 19:18.783
I remember reporting once to Bill Mobley that a board member had contacted us with some request.

19:19.645 --> 19:23.312
And I understood the president's concern because board members had a habit of

19:24.035 --> 19:26.519
reaching down into the system instead of going through it.

19:26.580 --> 19:30.026
Was the board member trying to determine policy in that case?

19:30.386 --> 19:34.173
No, more concern about the care of a particular student.

19:34.453 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, it was really a very, a rather benign request.

19:38.100 --> 19:38.621
Information.

19:38.661 --> 19:39.883
Yes, right.

19:40.235 --> 19:47.984
And as you perceived your task when you arrived, there were no fires to be extinguished.

19:48.004 --> 19:50.767
There were no problems to be overcome.

19:50.827 --> 19:52.689
It was to begin.

19:52.930 --> 19:53.430
That's right.

19:53.750 --> 19:54.251
Exactly.

19:54.271 --> 19:56.994
Yeah, it was a very positive way.

19:57.014 --> 20:06.105
I mean, I've often thought that you would have had to have screwed up badly to mess this opportunity up.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.267
Yeah, all of the... It was just...

20:09.563 --> 20:13.488
It seemed to me like it was just the right time for everything to start.

20:14.189 --> 20:24.262
The institution was, there was, because of the student group that I mentioned and that faculty staff committee, there was a growing awareness that A&M was behind in this area, needed this.

20:25.363 --> 20:34.575
And then with the spirit here and the traditions and the institution being so solid, it was just like all the forces were converging at the right time.

20:34.856 --> 20:37.579
I know even at the College of Education, when I went to my first faculty meeting,

20:38.116 --> 20:49.257
I was just so taken by, and this, I guess, is part of Earl Rutter's legacy, the new faculty coming in from, you know, I was from Indiana University, there's one from UCLA, Michigan State, Penn State.

20:49.697 --> 20:53.785
I mean, all of a sudden, it was like A&M's doors were being thrown open.

20:54.025 --> 20:58.133
And one of the things that I always tell people who don't know A&M is,

20:58.687 --> 21:10.494
I think it is amazing how this university has retained its essential value system while also opening its doors and letting in disparate groups that they didn't used to serve.

21:10.714 --> 21:15.645
And to me, it's an incredible process over the 27 years I've been here.

21:15.906 --> 21:16.527
Remarkable.

21:16.928 --> 21:21.555
And during those early years, the enrollment, of course, is almost exploding.

21:21.675 --> 21:22.637
Right, right.

21:24.259 --> 21:30.288
How did you kind of measure progress in those early years?

21:31.410 --> 21:35.095
What made you think that you were moving forward and getting things done?

21:35.596 --> 21:38.741
One of the things is just the fact of who's showing up at your door.

21:39.542 --> 21:45.130
And it didn't take too long before we were on, quote, waiting lists.

21:45.464 --> 21:48.589
And that was always very distressing as a young director.

21:48.649 --> 21:50.972
I used to even go home and think about that.

21:52.294 --> 22:05.333
How do we, I mean, we knew we were wedded to the idea that A&M is not a state mental health facility, that our role was to provide short-term developmental counseling and to intervene in crises to protect life.

22:06.315 --> 22:09.379
And yet we began, because of the staff,

22:09.680 --> 22:20.332
we began getting so many students coming that pretty soon we were hitting the waiting list and we'd have to say to, unless it was an emergency, we'll see you a week from now, but we can't see you today or tomorrow.

22:20.812 --> 22:31.764
And so you, and I had, when I was director at East Texas State, I had three faculty from the counseling department were half-time in there and they were not particularly very good, I didn't think.

22:31.864 --> 22:34.867
And you can see it in your, just your numbers.

22:35.248 --> 22:37.290
The kids, they vote.

22:38.030 --> 22:39.191
by coming or not coming.

22:39.512 --> 22:42.556
And here with the staff we had, they immediately started coming.

22:43.397 --> 22:55.411
And describe typical student numbers, the typical interview, the counseling sessions.

22:55.632 --> 22:56.172
Yeah, sure.

22:57.153 --> 23:00.898
Counseling services on large university campuses like this

23:01.267 --> 23:10.282
Typically, and this is going to sound paltry, but typically you'll see about 10% of the student body, which people say, gee, only 4,000 students a year.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.886
Well, yeah.

23:13.046 --> 23:15.851
But that's pretty typical for any large university.

23:15.871 --> 23:21.039
And this center is one of what we call the big 20 centers in the country now.

23:22.322 --> 23:24.425
It was not anything prior to this.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.869
I'm digressing just for a moment.

23:27.119 --> 23:53.076
I had gone to our national organizations, the Association of University and College Counseling Center Directors, and I had been there for three years representing East Texas State, and then I came from A&M, and people knew me, of course, but were surprised to see me with a different institutional affiliation, and a few of them were aware of Texas A&M, but nobody from A&M had ever gone to those meetings and that, so that's another example of A&M

23:53.343 --> 23:57.027
you know, through a number of us began really striking out nationally.

23:57.788 --> 24:04.796
I think your question was about how we knew that we were doing was on target.

24:05.296 --> 24:06.518
Yeah.

24:07.198 --> 24:11.603
The other thing we began getting was more referrals from faculty and staff.

24:12.284 --> 24:17.029
And typically if you're not serving people very well, they're not going to send them back.

24:17.049 --> 24:20.413
In those days we had a little thank you for the referral form.

24:20.883 --> 24:25.130
which psychology laws, confidentiality laws, put a kibosh on later.

24:25.190 --> 24:29.979
But we used to send faculty and staff a thank you note and that John Jones made it to us.

24:30.399 --> 24:31.441
Thank you for the referral.

24:31.942 --> 24:33.745
And that kind of communication helped a lot.

24:33.765 --> 24:39.415
So the numbers of students coming in, the number of referrals from all over the institution,

24:39.496 --> 24:41.719
was another really good sign.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.842
And then you get the thank you notes.

24:44.403 --> 24:52.796
And you know when you get a kid who comes in and they're talking suicide and you start working with them and they never do it.

24:54.238 --> 24:56.922
Or if they've made an attempt, they never do it again.

24:56.982 --> 24:58.684
And so you have that data.

24:58.704 --> 24:59.766
You have that case data.

25:00.640 --> 25:06.686
Make me believe that I had no idea of what a typical counseling session is like.

25:07.086 --> 25:07.307
Sure.

25:07.927 --> 25:09.629
Typical individual counseling.

25:09.969 --> 25:14.954
Typically, most students will see a counselor or psychologist once a week.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.777
It's about a 50-minute hour, or it should be.

25:18.377 --> 25:22.441
That's to give staff time to write some case notes, which are required by law, too.

25:23.422 --> 25:29.128
Some of us, though, are so humanistic that we run right up to the hour, and then we see the next student, and then we get behind it.

25:29.513 --> 25:30.254
But we'll do that.

25:30.294 --> 25:40.388
The initial session is typically one of, I usually will pass some time a day with a person just momentarily to give them a feel of me.

25:40.948 --> 25:46.556
But then fairly quickly ask them if they can begin talking about what it is that brought them in.

25:46.616 --> 25:53.565
And usually, I think most of us are very careful to be very intent listeners in the beginning.

25:55.528 --> 25:59.453
You're trying to put the person at ease because they're beginning to self-disclose.

25:59.990 --> 26:00.751
And that's scary.

26:01.432 --> 26:13.810
In fact, I have learned in my life that some people become very adept at self-disclosing too much too quickly, and you never see them again after the first session because they become psychologically naked and they're embarrassed to come back.

26:14.231 --> 26:16.514
A few students, you've got to almost hold them and slow them down.

26:16.854 --> 26:18.517
But most of them you've got to encourage.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.541
And, I mean, it's even like our style of dress.

26:21.561 --> 26:24.225
Now, I typically wear a shirt and tie because I'm administrative.

26:24.560 --> 26:33.753
but our male psychologists will dress in slacks and a polo shirt and that, and that's to try to cut down the formality and the superior-subordinate relationship.

26:34.795 --> 26:36.878
And it's a matter of listening intently.

26:36.958 --> 26:46.011
It's a matter of also reflecting, feeling back as you begin to pick up feelings of whatever the emotion is, a flat affect, anger.

26:46.396 --> 27:02.845
anxiety, depression, trying to put those things in words and also restating the content of what they've said, kind of parroting back to them in slightly different words what they're kind of saying to you to check on whether you're receiving those messages correctly.

27:02.865 --> 27:11.020
And that's very powerful because it makes the person feel understood and it allows them to go deeper and deeper into what their thoughts and feelings are.

27:11.489 --> 27:13.491
And that's the first session.

27:13.511 --> 27:19.537
You're really trying to build a lot of rapport, a good working alliance, a working relationship with people.

27:19.978 --> 27:30.729
And then usually at the end of that session, we typically are assessing whether, and this is going back to Jack Williams, whether or not we are the appropriate place for them.

27:30.989 --> 27:35.674
Because we will get people in here who need a good year or two of psychotherapy.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.922
People are trained to do it, but that's not A&M's function.

27:39.443 --> 27:47.994
And so if they're going to be a long-term client, then we're immediately assessing in that first interview, sometimes in two interviews, with the idea of referring out.

27:48.395 --> 27:54.964
If not, if they are appropriate for the service, then you're starting to create a game plan.

27:55.925 --> 27:58.188
And we like to keep clients working.

27:59.109 --> 28:04.176
Sometimes there's homework, reading things, talking to other people...

28:05.050 --> 28:09.378
And so we actually begin to talk about what we're going to do in the next session.

28:10.139 --> 28:12.563
Always try in a session to summarize it at the end.

28:13.505 --> 28:26.248
Say, now, what we've talked about today is da-da-da-da-da-da, and you're feeling that, and you're kind of thinking about these options of solving this problem, and okay, so we sort of tie it up in a bow at the end of a session.

28:27.730 --> 28:36.395
And normally, particularly then, in the early years, the work day began at about what?

28:37.598 --> 28:39.504
It began at 8 o'clock.

28:39.684 --> 28:41.790
It was the university schedule we followed.

28:42.074 --> 28:45.684
Clients, typically we saw student clients beginning about 8.30.

28:46.345 --> 28:46.446
Okay.

28:46.466 --> 28:47.609
Yeah.

28:47.629 --> 28:50.135
And they were scheduled about one an hour?

28:50.196 --> 28:51.359
Yeah, one an hour.

28:51.419 --> 28:58.598
The maximum that we asked staff to do was five hours a day of direct service.

28:59.084 --> 29:00.366
direct counseling service.

29:00.386 --> 29:02.048
That would either be individual counseling.

29:02.549 --> 29:03.830
I didn't mention group counseling.

29:03.851 --> 29:04.592
That's a little different.

29:04.732 --> 29:10.660
And then all of us serve a portion of our time each week on emergency duty.

29:11.181 --> 29:18.350
We have a couple of people who are unscheduled and we just wait for students to walk in and they typically are used every single day.

29:18.811 --> 29:22.796
Now emergency, we don't define what an emergency is.

29:22.836 --> 29:24.459
We allow the student to define it.

29:24.519 --> 29:25.480
I had a young man

29:25.882 --> 29:35.512
who came in late on a Friday afternoon, high anxiety, and I thought, well, I've got depression or suicidal ideation here.

29:35.932 --> 29:37.554
He had a big date that weekend.

29:37.614 --> 29:39.175
He had asked his parents for 20 bucks.

29:39.215 --> 29:44.441
They had refused, and he was in deep trouble, and he was grief-stricken over that.

29:44.641 --> 29:51.788
That's not my definition of an emergency, but to him it was, and so when a student tells us that,

29:52.156 --> 29:53.458
We take it deadly seriously.

29:53.498 --> 29:55.760
We let the students define what the emergency is.

29:55.861 --> 29:58.964
Are you at liberty to say what the advice was to that young man?

29:59.465 --> 30:02.669
Honestly, it's so long ago, Askel, I can't remember.

30:03.110 --> 30:08.657
I just remember when the secretary came in and said, this young man is shaking, he's anxiety ridden.

30:08.697 --> 30:10.819
I thought, uh-oh, uh-oh.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.843
In fact, I was getting ready to call Claude Goswick and say,

30:14.228 --> 30:16.131
Claude, I may need to bring somebody over here.

30:16.151 --> 30:17.714
We may need to put them in over the weekend.

30:17.734 --> 30:35.747
I had all these thoughts of getting all of these practical things in motion, and then he hits me with the... And I'm assuming that even in that kind of situation, it is inappropriate professionally to solve the problem by laughing.

30:36.655 --> 30:38.658
Yes, that is correct.

30:38.918 --> 30:53.460
I chuckled internally, having some years on my odometer, but also this must have been quite a woman because he was trying to impress her and he was in bad shape.

30:53.480 --> 31:06.139
In those early years, did the students that you all assisted, were they comparatively a cross-section of the student body, male, female?

31:07.047 --> 31:25.866
uh traditionally in in the beginning they the males probably outnumbered the females because we had so few women but but i was meaning in terms of the per capita percentages yeah uh still i think in the early years because see when i came here a m was 21 500 but there were only 900 women yeah

31:25.846 --> 31:29.193
So they vastly, you know, the males vastly outnumbered.

31:29.213 --> 31:32.860
It didn't take very long, which is true in general in society.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.566
Women use counseling services much more than men.

31:35.586 --> 31:36.067
Oh, really?

31:36.087 --> 31:37.049
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.011
Gender-wise, they do.

31:38.472 --> 31:43.602
And it didn't take very long in my history at A&M to begin to see those numbers and percentages reflected.
