00:01.938 --> 00:06.504
...continuing highlights the program. Also at 
ONR, Phenon Jennings pitted our ideas and

00:08.828 --> 00:19.383
questions against Gil Maton's organizing 
ability over at the J.I. Thompson Company and gave

00:19.423 --> 00:21.786
us Tenoch. In 1972, the Marine Technology Society 
was kind enough to give me its Compass Award. In

00:31.267 --> 00:43.185
accepting that, I could not accept it for myself, 
but I did accept it in the name of the participants

00:31.267 --> 00:43.185
in my bureauships program over 20 odd years. The 
names of the persons who had some input or were

00:44.688 --> 00:59.130
connected in some way with that program may be of 
interest, and I would like to read them into the

00:44.688 --> 00:59.130
record as I did in that speech, somewhat 
geographically. Up in Canada, John Longard of the

00:59.870 --> 01:05.498

Fisher, who later went to Annapolis and joined 
Mike Stanley there. At Hudson Laboratories, yes,

02:09.630 --> 02:16.380
we had part of the startup of that. We put half a 
million dollars in it. Bob Frosh and Al Berman. At

Jim Brown, Art Malloy, and Cyril Hopkins.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.740
As Scripps at MPL, I mentioned the directors. Vic 
Anderson may have gotten some help from us from

04:42.601 --> 04:50.836
time to time, for the physical laboratory was a 
blue ship's lab for many years. Again, those

04:52.259 --> 05:01.776
directors, Carl Eckert, Sir Charles Wright, Al 
Folk, and Fred Spies, also Leonard Lieberman,

Snodgrass, Ted Folsom, and in the early days in San 
Diego, Paul Hoare. The Deep Submergence group,

05:22.333 --> 05:25.738

McGregor, Swede Momsen, Admiral Coates, and in 
industry, Björn Mitton, Horace Tannock-Waite.

07:59.922 --> 08:13.475
one has but to look at the own interest of each of 
these people to find out something of what Bishop

07:59.922 --> 08:13.475
was interested in and what its programs supported 
to some extent, directly or indirectly. It's not

08:15.217 --> 08:17.579
such a large list when you come to think of it. All 
intimate related, all known personally to each

08:18.660 --> 08:23.665
other because of conferences and meetings. In 
fact, at one time, There was even a small inner

08:26.905 --> 08:36.999
group of R&D based on the script classes of Dr. 
Spildrup who had round robin letters each year.

08:37.019 --> 08:44.189
And it may be of interest to read the address list of 
that letter as sent out by Dale Leeper. On 3 August

08:45.931 --> 08:56.406
1967,

08:45.931 --> 08:56.406
that year Dale had received and reprinted and 
edited forms, letters from Charles Bates, Wayne

08:56.926 --> 09:15.236
Bate, Louis Kapoor, King Cooper, Ray Gordon, Hoji 
Hidaka, Paul Hall, Willie Jacobs, Bill Keelhorn,

Dick Vetter, Bill Cameron, Esther Hamel, Hector

09:24.922 --> 09:37.095
Itcherberry, Roy Cheney, Warren Worcester, and 
Dale Leeper. In addition, some 14 others had been

09:38.296 --> 09:41.620
written but not heard from. Ernie Anderson, Bob 
Arthur, Dave Carridge, John Cochran, Giff Ewing,

09:41.660 --> 09:51.030
Pierre Groen, Douglas Inman, Johnny Canales, 
Walter Monk, Morris Nieberger, June Petullo,

09:52.057 --> 10:03.668
Donald Pritchett, Warren Thompson, and Ted 
Folsom. The passing note. Any description of Dr.

10:09.117 --> 10:23.415
H. Hughes Frederick's early classes in 
oceanography should include the four Argentines

10:09.117 --> 10:23.415
who, under Juan Peron, were sent up to study 
oceanography. They were Rodolfo Panzarini,

10:24.156 --> 10:36.272
later Admiral Panzarini, who retired as head of 
the Antarctic Institute in Argentina. Iglesias,

10:38.345 --> 10:47.889
I believe his name was Hector, I-G-L-E-S-I-S, 
Iglesias, who became a naval officer. Luis

10:49.794 --> 10:53.704
Capullo, who became Dr. Capullo, at Texas A&M and 
was active in SCORE and IOC and other committees in

10:54.190 --> 11:04.104
oceanography in Europe for so long. And Hector 
Echebehere, E-T-C-H-E-B-E-H-E-R-E,

11:05.106 --> 11:18.966
who became a naval officer and an industrialist in 
Argentina. Panzerini established the first

11:20.448 --> 11:40.988
oceanographic, or hydrographic, correctly, 
hydrographic office in the Argentine Navy, and

11:20.448 --> 11:40.988
Luis Capura was the chief of that office for a while 
before he came back to Texas A&M to get his

11:20.448 --> 11:40.988
doctorate. Also in passing, notes should be made 
of the names of women who have been important in

11:41.879 --> 12:01.980
oceanography, beginning with Mary Sears, Dr. 
Mary Sears, now Woods Hole, retired, who was the

11:41.879 --> 12:01.980
sole active assistant to Roger Revelle at the 
Hydrographic Office during the war. Then June

12:02.737 --> 12:12.393
Petullo, the late June Petullo was long a 
professor at the University of Oregon at

12:02.737 --> 12:12.393
Corvallis. Also Margaret Robinson at Scripps for 
her continued long-term waking up of the

12:13.735 --> 12:21.808
basithemograph data. and perhaps more in 
sentiment because she was a student at Scripps

12:22.700 --> 12:32.771
when I was there, Jeannie Clark, the famous girl of 
fishes and shark research. Oceanographers of

12:34.653 --> 12:51.171
today bow down with a mountain of paperwork and a 
royal protocol and necessity for taking care of

12:34.653 --> 12:51.171
prestige of different activities. Look back with 
yearning and longing to the old underwater sound

12:51.252 --> 12:59.722
propagation committee chaired by Beckett 
Hershey. With no regular meeting places, but

13:01.124 --> 13:13.378
always bringing the top people into the field and 
together for an informal discussion and review of

13:01.124 --> 13:13.378
their programs in the morning. and in the 
afternoon, usually a determination of the

13:14.033 --> 13:22.561
priorities and decisions of the program to be 
carried out for the rest of the year. The funding

13:22.621 --> 13:35.632
was taken care of by the different aid activities 
and was not a major portion of the committee's

13:22.621 --> 13:35.632
business. In other words, if Fred Spieth said that 
he had a vehicle which could pursue a certain type

13:36.453 --> 13:42.859
of research better than Lamont, Fred Spieth, MPL, 
would go ahead and do it, and Lamont would do

13:43.666 --> 13:50.355
something else with its money. But the ease with 
which discussions were made and priorities

13:51.517 --> 14:03.774
established under this completely informal 
committee work and the able chairman of Brackett

13:51.517 --> 14:03.774
Hersey was a delight to all who remember those 
meetings. The nearest thing to it while the

14:06.700 --> 14:12.067
three-day meetings at Our Head Lake in the 
fisheries area under O.E. Seti called the Epoch

14:12.127 --> 14:14.470
Committee. With the passing of those days, life 
has become much less joyous to the

14:15.472 --> 14:21.660
oceanographers. Captain T.K. Treadmill at Texas 
A&M and others should be questioned for the

14:23.482 --> 14:34.497
history of the development of the oceanographic 
class of ships which the Navy built. Early after

14:36.755 --> 14:57.939
the war, a relatively large number of small 
military ships were converted for use by the

14:36.755 --> 14:57.939
laboratories, beginning with the San Pablo and 
the Rehoboth, the converted seaplane tenders of

14:36.755 --> 14:57.939
the Hydrographic Office.

15:00.683 --> 15:06.289
The funding of the conversions, the choice of the 
ships, the priorities given to work, And the final

15:06.792 --> 15:31.356
design and building of oceanographic vessels by 
the Navy itself, the AGOR class, should be looked

15:06.792 --> 15:31.356
into very carefully because it was, while the 
money lasted, a very important vehicle means of

15:06.792 --> 15:31.356
getting the oceanographers to sea. And it 
permitted the multi-ship operation

15:36.475 --> 15:47.048
investigations which became so important later 
on in the International Geophysical Year and

15:36.475 --> 15:47.048
other efforts of that kind. A somewhat unique 
cruise stemming directly from the World War II

15:48.410 --> 15:58.602
type of research was the Madea Expedition. in 
which oceanographers and acousticians and their

15:58.953 --> 16:24.117
acoustic laboratories under the direction of Bob 
Frasch at the then existing Hudson Laboratories

15:58.953 --> 16:24.117
of the University of Columbia, New York,

15:58.953 --> 16:24.117
combined the talents of two great groups and the 
gathering of the information each needed. Any

16:25.430 --> 16:40.348
history should cover the expeditions of the 1950s 
and 60s with as much interest and accurate detail

16:25.430 --> 16:40.348
as has been given to the Challenger, the Meteor, 
and the other classical expeditions in the past.

16:41.750 --> 16:46.476
It is with great pride that I read into this record 
in passing Names of the members of this ilk who were

16:46.996 --> 17:04.734
present at the retirement luncheon for King 
Cooper on 12 January 1972, given by Assistant

16:46.996 --> 17:04.734
Secretary of the Navy, R&D Bob Price, in the 
Pentagon. I read them, their names and their

17:05.895 --> 17:09.319

Navy, Deputy Director for Navy Laboratories, and

18:43.973 --> 19:03.985
Mr. Henry O'Neill, Ocean Science and Technology 
Division, Office of Naval Research. It takes a

19:05.347 --> 19:09.053
very small stretch of the imagination. to see what 
my pride at having such attendance and what it

19:09.725 --> 19:16.376
meant to me. Another tidbit before I forget it. I 
can state on personal knowledge that the true

19:21.445 --> 19:27.295
developer and the true inventor Now the 
expendable bathy thermograph, which is now used

19:28.102 --> 19:39.918
in such great quantities, was due to the work of Jim 
Snodgrass at Scripps. This and many other things

19:41.601 --> 19:48.490
he has contributed as a story all of its own, but in 
this particular case, there was on record a letter

19:50.073 --> 20:09.225
which I once wrote him asking why we couldn't 
develop a sinking device which would be picked up

19:50.073 --> 20:09.225
by a surface-towed acoustic receiver which would 
give the temperature at the different depths as

19:50.073 --> 20:09.225
the device sank. And Snodgrass came back with the 
information that the signal noise due to water

20:16.938 --> 20:35.580
transmission was so great that what we should use 
would be a wire which would give a connection to the

20:16.938 --> 20:35.580
power unit that was sinking or the signaling unit 
that was sinking. Sometime later, Mr. Graham, I

20:39.449 --> 20:41.294
believe his name is. And I had a calendar reference 
memo of it, visited the bureauships, and forced

20:41.354 --> 20:50.698
that they can. And I said, go see Jim Snodgrass. 
They went out to see Jim Snodgrass. O&R, through

20:57.752 --> 21:03.379
some mishap, had lost Snodgrass's patent 
application. And as the thing worked out, the

21:04.360 --> 21:12.450
Supercarrying Company won the suit for patent 
rights on the expandable bathymograph. But all of

21:13.652 --> 21:23.023
that happened after Jim Snodgrass had 
interviewed them and told them of his idea This is

21:23.881 --> 21:26.868
the way I see it and the way I believe it truly 
happened. Stop. Likewise, another milestone

21:29.413 --> 21:42.683
instrument development was due and accredited to 
BUSHIP's funding on the original report from

21:29.413 --> 21:42.683
Morris Ewing's Lamont. Dorothy Geological 
Observatory. Under Ewing's direction, Bernard

21:47.116 --> 22:03.445
Ruskin

21:47.116 --> 22:03.445
developed the Precision Depth Recorder, 
incorporating Ewing's original ideas of a tuning

21:47.116 --> 22:03.445
fork control of frequency. The ship's generators 
varied so much that the The distance measurement

22:08.988 --> 22:30.591
deduced from the time measurement was an error, 
but by using a tuning fork and developing the

22:08.988 --> 22:30.591
recorder which Leskin and Ewing developed, they 
were able to get the precision to something like

22:08.988 --> 22:30.591
six feet out of 18,000.

22:30.942 --> 22:41.416
and was the beginning of the accurate bottom 
mapping which has come out so beautifully in the

22:30.942 --> 22:41.416
interpretations of Bruce Hazen who was at Lamont. 
Stop. One more word. The precision graphic

22:44.500 --> 22:53.693
recorder developed at Woods Hole using a 
different type of recording paper and being

22:44.500 --> 22:53.693
programmed in order to get recordings from 
different regions and layers of the water column,

22:53.943 --> 23:07.318
also received bureauship's funding, but has 
always been claimed as an ONR development.

23:08.139 --> 23:16.989
However, the precision depth recorder of Luskin 
and Ewing preceded the one developed by Hersey and

23:08.139 --> 23:16.989
Brednott at Woods Hole. Stop.
