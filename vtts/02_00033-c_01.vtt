WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:08.731
So, the shipwreck, pollen then doesn't melt when it gets wet.

00:10.573 --> 00:10.633
No.

00:10.653 --> 00:14.478
Pollen is a really good material.

00:14.639 --> 00:20.206
Pollen is one of the more durable materials made in nature.

00:21.367 --> 00:28.637
We have been able to find pollen, actually, or, well, pollen or spores made of the same material.

00:28.887 --> 00:31.530
nearly two billion years old.

00:32.031 --> 00:43.043
They go all the way back to the Kakabikia pepper shale of South Africa, which actually dates from the Precambrian.

00:44.425 --> 00:46.668
But anyway, pollen is very durable.

00:46.688 --> 00:51.373
It will oxidize and will get destroyed, but in many deposits it remains very well preserved.

00:51.914 --> 00:57.240
So what happens is when you have a cargo, let's say of wheat,

00:57.592 --> 01:04.478
or you have a cargo of grapes or wine, pollen gets trapped in those commodities.

01:05.159 --> 01:17.310
And even though the seeds have been eaten up by sea life or been oxidized or destroyed or disintegrated, the pollen doesn't, and it stays behind.

01:17.971 --> 01:25.438
So by analyzing the pollen in shipwreck sites, in some cases we were able to tell what cargoes they were carrying,

01:25.418 --> 01:37.350
what kind of foods that were being eaten as evidenced by materials in the bilge, which was of course a common dumping ground in historic times in ships.

01:37.550 --> 01:48.441
Occasionally we can even find evidence of perhaps where the ship came from in terms of pollen that might have gotten into the ship at ports of call or from its origin.

01:49.182 --> 01:52.405
We also looked at commodities.

01:53.228 --> 02:00.478
a type of commodity called terebin, T-E-R-E-B-I-N-T-H, which is like frankincense and myrrh.

02:01.259 --> 02:14.237
It is a type of incense that during, oh, way back in the ancient kingdoms of Egypt and so forth were a very highly prized commodity.

02:14.277 --> 02:16.080
It was also used in embalming.

02:17.422 --> 02:21.227
It comes, it's a sap from the pistachio tree.

02:22.152 --> 02:26.610
Anyway, they found a shipwreck site off the coast of Turkey that had a

02:27.130 --> 02:29.553
large amount of this terebinth.

02:29.833 --> 02:38.824
And we analyzed some of the terebinth because it is sap, because it is sticky, kind of like sugar maple syrup.

02:39.065 --> 02:44.832
Pollen that would be blowing around in the air would get trapped on this sticky surface and become incorporated in the terebinth.

02:44.872 --> 02:46.874
So we analyzed the terebinth.

02:47.715 --> 02:57.087
And based on our analysis, we concluded that it probably came from an area in Upper Jordan or Lower Syria.

02:57.387 --> 03:06.926
So, based on the types of pollen we found in the terabinth and what was in those regions at that time, that's where we conclude it probably came from.

03:07.287 --> 03:11.034
Well, these are the kind of things that we can gather from shipwreck sites.

03:11.054 --> 03:18.349
The other thing, one of my students who worked on the Betsy, the HMS Betsy,

03:18.329 --> 03:24.140
which was a ship that was a supply ship for Cornwallis at Yorktown.

03:24.160 --> 03:40.793
And this ship was sunk, purposely sunk, just before the siege ended in an attempt to try to block the Potomac River for the French fleet that was shelling them, and they didn't want to get any closer.

03:41.836 --> 03:56.908
An analysis of the Betsy, looking at all of the pollen and everything, turns out it shows that this ship was a supply ship, and it was probably used for quartering horses.

03:56.888 --> 04:00.454
There was a lot of old pollen on there and other commodities.

04:00.514 --> 04:01.797
It looked like it was a storage.

04:01.837 --> 04:05.203
It was basically a storage vessel used to store a lot of commodities.

04:05.283 --> 04:11.815
But they believed that a lot of it had to do with probably quartering cavalry horses and so forth like that.

04:11.855 --> 04:18.306
But anyway, so this is something that we've been pioneering as well.

04:18.286 --> 04:25.117
And then, of course, along the way, we've worked very closely with people in geology.

04:25.197 --> 04:35.113
In fact, I've been the co-chair of five PhDs in geology in which people have used palynology.

04:35.532 --> 04:51.044
of primarily tertiary deposits in an effort to understand paleo environments during the tertiary, or lignite deposits, particularly associated with some of the deposits around here at lower eurcene and so forth.

04:51.485 --> 04:54.672
In fact, I worked with Bob Berg on, remember when they drilled that great big

04:54.652 --> 04:56.856
on campus.

04:56.976 --> 05:00.642
They dropped a 23,000 foot rig core.

05:01.263 --> 05:05.791
Well, you know, I got to look at some of the samples that went through the tertiary deposits in that core.

05:07.955 --> 05:12.222
So, yeah, we've kept pretty active.

05:12.792 --> 05:27.351
We have a fairly extensive pollen collection here, mainly because I've been fortunate as these oil companies have consolidated and have, well, gone out of business, if you want to call it that.

05:28.793 --> 05:40.048
Mobile Oil spent 20 years developing and processing pollen to develop a reference collection of modern pollen types

05:40.568 --> 05:46.258
of about eight or nine thousand taxa from all over the world.

05:48.432 --> 05:59.684
A person sometimes doesn't appreciate what this really means because if you want to make a pollen slide, if you want to do a slide of pollen, this is what it involves.

05:59.704 --> 06:03.268
The first thing you have to do is you have to go find a plant that is in flower.

06:03.969 --> 06:06.711
So that means you have to go there at the right time of the year and find the flower.

06:07.512 --> 06:14.760
The next thing is you have to make absolutely positive that the plant is identified correctly to genus and species.

06:14.740 --> 06:43.465
Now that you know that for certain what planted is and you have the flower, you then have to take it into a laboratory and spend about six or seven hours processing it using chemicals such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and so forth in order to remove all of the exceperaneous material, the debris, the cellulose, cytoplasm, waxes, lipids, all of that kind of stuff, to leave only the pollen

06:43.445 --> 06:45.969
itself, the outer wall of the pollen grain.

06:46.589 --> 06:48.092
Then you have to mount it on the slide.

06:48.372 --> 06:56.984
Okay, now, if you have to do that for 8,000 different taxa, imagine how much it costs, you know, in terms of time and effort and money.

06:57.785 --> 07:12.726
Well, Mobile Oil, when they merged with Exxon, they had this big collection, and I was fortunate enough to know some people in Mobile, and they donated it to Texas A&M University.

07:12.706 --> 07:18.476
It had a conservative estimated tax write-off of $750,000.

07:18.756 --> 07:24.546
That was valuing each slide at $10.

07:24.566 --> 07:25.628
Oh, my.

07:25.728 --> 07:26.008
Yes.

07:26.329 --> 07:28.993
And I don't think you could make a slide for $10.

07:29.414 --> 07:38.289
But anyway, then when BP and Exxon merged, was it Amoco?

07:38.309 --> 07:38.950
No.

07:39.436 --> 07:40.257
BP Amoco.

07:40.818 --> 07:41.899
BP Amoco merged.

07:41.979 --> 07:43.000
Yeah, it was ExxonMobil.

07:43.501 --> 07:53.934
When BP Amoco merged, the Amoco office in Houston had a collection of almost equal size because, of course, these oil companies weren't going to share with each other.

07:54.014 --> 07:59.261
So they had a massive collection, which fortunately I knew some people in Amoco.

07:59.802 --> 08:01.223
So we got that collection as well.

08:01.384 --> 08:04.988
So we've got the mobile collection and the Amoco collection.

08:05.491 --> 08:33.085
And then, in addition to that, there was a botanist by the name of Meredith Lear, L-I-E-U-X, who taught at LSU for about 10 or 15 years, and was a real pioneer in the area of malicious polynology, or honey pollen, and developed a collection of about 1,250 taxa just from Louisiana.

08:33.672 --> 08:52.812
and uh one thing led to another she didn't uh well she didn't get tenure that's the bottom line uh she said she was run out because of the old boy network and so forth and i don't know the story but she's an environmental lawyer now but nevertheless

08:53.146 --> 08:57.191
She donated her collection to Texas A&M as well.

08:57.211 --> 09:04.899
So we have those three collections, in addition to all of the materials that we personally have been making over the last 30 years.

09:04.999 --> 09:13.609
So we have one of the best collections, I seriously guess, probably one of the ten best collections in the world of Pollen Taxa.

09:14.029 --> 09:16.352
And why is this important?

09:16.568 --> 09:19.672
For one thing, if you're going to do forensics, you've got to have this.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.875
And I've had some very interesting cases in forensics.

09:22.935 --> 09:23.776
I'll just give you a couple.

09:25.358 --> 09:27.360
I got a sample from New Zealand one day.

09:28.542 --> 09:40.976
A friend of mine in New Zealand sent me a sample because somebody in New Zealand had bought 250,000 pounds of honey, which was supposed to be from Canada.

09:40.996 --> 09:46.002
They bought it from a Canadian distributor, and it was supposed to be Canadian clover honey.

09:46.471 --> 09:58.101
Well, the guy that bought all of the stuff for, of course, packaging and resale in New Zealand tasted it and said that he didn't think it tasted like Canadian clover honey.

09:58.503 --> 09:59.945
But he couldn't tell for sure.

10:02.109 --> 10:12.585
So he sent a sample to some police office in New Zealand, which then sent it to some palynologist in New Zealand who said, I don't know anything about Canadian flora.

10:13.467 --> 10:17.313
They sent it to me, and we've done quite a bit of research in Canada.

10:17.773 --> 10:21.018
So I looked at the sample, and it was not Canadian.

10:21.179 --> 10:22.000
It was Chinese.

10:22.841 --> 10:24.183
There's no question about it.

10:24.284 --> 10:25.185
They had a lot of...

10:25.165 --> 10:54.143
pollen types in there which can be found in China and very few that would be found in Canada so I wrote them back and said what you've got is 250,000 pounds of Chinese hunting I don't care whether it came from Canada or not that's what you've got so that's but the point I'm making is if I did not have a good collection of flora from all over the world and had some of these Chinese types that I could key out from looking at these samples I couldn't have done that

10:54.612 --> 10:57.436
Now, you all are quartered today in what area?

10:59.319 --> 11:00.601
You mean, where do we live?

11:00.641 --> 11:00.881
Yeah.

11:01.763 --> 11:05.829
Well, we were gypsies for quite a while.

11:06.069 --> 11:11.117
We were in the Agricultural Building, I mean, I'm sorry, the Agronomy Building for a while, YMCA Building for a while.

11:12.318 --> 11:16.264
Then we moved to Bolton, and then from Bolton we went to Dooley Bell for a while.

11:16.284 --> 11:20.611
And from Dooley Bell we finally were moved into our own building.

11:20.671 --> 11:24.096
We now live in the Anthropology Building, which was originally

11:24.481 --> 11:27.044
the engineering building back in the days.

11:27.145 --> 11:36.557
In fact, the departmental office is in the office in the area that one time Calhoun occupied when he was dean of geosciences.

11:37.799 --> 11:42.785
In the very early days of geosciences, that was the engineering building.

11:42.906 --> 11:44.788
In fact, aerospace engineering, I think.

11:44.808 --> 11:46.270
Now, when did you all move to that building?

11:46.891 --> 11:51.617
That was in the early 90s, like 1993, 1994, around and near somewhere.

11:51.637 --> 11:55.542
And prior to that, we had a real problem.

11:55.562 --> 12:14.046
And one of the problems that separated Nautical from anthropology, in addition to the unequal pay, in addition to the 12-month appointments, and in addition to the fact that all of the Nautical faculty have some type of endowed professorship or endowed chair,

12:14.583 --> 12:16.946
whereas none of the anthropologists do.

12:16.966 --> 12:34.228
But anyway, the other thing that separated us physically, and that's not talking money, but I mean physical, was the fact that Nautical, for a number of years, was housed out at the Riverside campus, which we affectionately called the Annex, in old barracks buildings.

12:34.377 --> 12:37.560
And the reason was we did not have enough space for them on campus.

12:37.640 --> 12:42.606
So for more than 10 years, they lived out at the Riverside campus.

12:43.106 --> 12:47.291
We lived on campus, which tended to further alienate the two groups.

12:48.572 --> 12:59.203
When we got this new building in the mid-90s, about 1995, for the first time, all of anthropology was together in one building.

12:59.740 --> 13:04.485
And it has done a lot for trying to put things back together.

13:04.525 --> 13:20.122
The only other thing that I think I could really add of importance here is that we got our PhD in 1989, but the important thing was that at that time they were only willing to give it to us in the field of archaeology.

13:21.423 --> 13:26.068
And the reason, of course George was happy, because nautical archaeology would come under that.

13:26.504 --> 13:32.153
We were a little disappointed because we had programs in cultural and physical and folklore.

13:33.616 --> 13:36.400
But we were willing to take whatever they'd give us.

13:37.221 --> 13:39.966
And so we accepted that in 1989.

13:40.286 --> 13:50.503
And it wasn't until about 1990, oh boy, late 90s, like 95 or 96, around the time we moved into our new building, that...

13:50.855 --> 14:00.840
we finally got the coordinating board to agree to expand that to include cultural anthropology and physical anthropology, but not folklore.

14:00.860 --> 14:04.108
We still did not have the authority to give a PhD in folklore.

14:04.148 --> 14:06.113
So now we can

14:06.093 --> 14:16.407
give a PhD in anthropology with a specialization in archaeology and all of its evrons and we can do it in physical and in cultural but not in folklore.

14:17.929 --> 14:26.160
The only other thing that has really changed, remember I said to George Bass way back in about 1980 or

14:26.140 --> 14:38.437
or 1979, got his hackles up over the things we were doing in anthropology and got his nautical archaeology program with a separate budget.

14:39.278 --> 14:51.996
Well, throughout my entire administration, I had to live with that in the sense that I was always responsible for what George did and nautical, but I never had the power to really do a whole lot.

14:52.499 --> 15:09.488
And in addition to that phone call I got from Keith Bryant, I got some phone calls from other people at various times because George had this tendency to sometimes fire off letters when he was in a bad mood, which he later would regret sending.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.495
Anyway, but nevertheless.

15:13.863 --> 15:25.204
The current dean, Dr. Woodrow Jones, decided several years ago that he wanted to reunify anthropology and put it all back together the way it should have been in the very beginning.

15:26.487 --> 15:28.991
The reason he felt he could get away with this was two things.

15:29.232 --> 15:35.263
First of all, George Bass is nearing retirement, and in fact the rumor is that he will retire

15:35.716 --> 15:42.976
at the end of this year, meaning at the end of December, January 1st of 2001.

15:43.277 --> 15:48.932
And Dean Jones also felt that it would be appropriate

15:49.199 --> 15:55.388
that I had been department head for a long time, but that they should have a new department head.

15:55.428 --> 16:06.703
So after serving from 1983 until 1999, I left the department as department head.

16:06.763 --> 16:17.198
And David Carlson, who I had hired in 1980 to come in and do the Cultural Resource Management Lab, which he did so effectively, became the new department head effective

16:17.178 --> 16:40.452
September 1 of 1999 last fall and at that time the budgets for nautical and anthropology were all collapsed into one budget so now finally the thing that I had pleaded for for 20 years happened and it's all back together again with a new department a new department head and

16:40.786 --> 16:43.231
and everything is rolling along as usual.

16:43.372 --> 17:00.769
So as far as where anthropology is going to go in the future, well, of course we have the 2020 plan and we would like to believe that we will be in the top 10 like the university would like to be by the year 2020.

17:01.137 --> 17:05.863
We're doing what we can with the resources that we have available to proceed in that direction.

17:06.403 --> 17:16.496
Right now, as far as I'm concerned, and as an individual, I'm, you know, just a regular professor again, which, in fact, I am enjoying because I now have more time to spend with my students.

17:16.596 --> 17:18.298
I currently have eight doctoral students.

17:18.758 --> 17:23.064
And, in fact, in my tenure at Texas A&M, I added them up the other day.

17:23.084 --> 17:27.609
I've graduated 31 PhDs since I've been here.

17:27.930 --> 17:29.912
That's more than one a year.

17:30.179 --> 17:34.003
So, anyway, where are some of those scattered nowadays?

17:34.023 --> 17:41.452
Well, one of them is teaching at the University of Arkansas, one is teaching at the University of Nebraska, one is teaching at the University of Maine at Orono.

17:41.472 --> 17:48.880
A number of them are privately employed doing what we call contract work.

17:48.900 --> 17:55.427
In other words, they have set themselves up as individuals that do research primarily

17:55.407 --> 18:05.143
pollen or in paleoethnobotany, they look at materials for archaeologists and then charge them a fee as the service they perform.

18:06.746 --> 18:10.412
Others are, of course, not all of these were in anthropology.

18:10.432 --> 18:18.926
Some of them were botanists, some of them were botany, one was in geography, two in geography, some were in geology.

18:18.966 --> 18:22.191
I should have said chair or co-chaired.

18:22.171 --> 18:33.801
The several of them in geology or one of them is high up in a big corporation down in Houston and I can't remember which one is an oil corporation.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.568
I think it's Exxon really.

18:38.793 --> 18:39.974
Let's see.

18:40.235 --> 18:42.117
One of them, of course, works for the USDA.

18:43.379 --> 18:45.421
And they're scattered out.

18:45.662 --> 18:50.487
Not all of them are gainfully employed in anthropology or even in botany.

18:51.068 --> 19:02.442
But one of them works for a dental hygiene corporation as the head of training.

19:02.703 --> 19:04.665
It trains dental hygienists.

19:06.164 --> 19:11.953
Another one is, how about this, another one is running a massage parlor in Austin.

19:11.973 --> 19:16.080
So it varies, but anyway.

19:17.162 --> 19:25.395
What advice would you give to the department for today and the future if you were hired as their consultant?

19:25.415 --> 19:30.062
In other words, if I came in and was asked to evaluate things and say,

19:32.675 --> 19:48.996
Well, one of the things that we have always had trouble with, and that is that although we have been on the forefront of multiculturalism, we have not yet succeeded in hiring either

19:49.313 --> 19:51.935
a Hispanic or an Afro-American.

19:52.056 --> 20:05.027
We've tried on a number of occasions but for one reason or another we've either not had the resources to do such or we have not been able to attract them to the physical environment of living in College Station.

20:06.068 --> 20:12.654
I think that would help our image for one thing and would help our cultural anthropology program.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.738
I think that we're doing a good job in

20:17.107 --> 20:18.169
nautical archaeology.

20:18.269 --> 20:24.961
We're the only university in the world that offers a doctoral program in which you can specialize in nautical archaeology.

20:25.782 --> 20:34.558
And we certainly do have a collection of students, more than about 59 or 60 graduate students, last time I counted,

20:34.927 --> 20:39.772
in nautical archaeology, and many of these come from foreign countries as well as from the United States.

20:40.713 --> 20:47.761
There's not a great market for nautical archaeologists, but nevertheless we have a lot of people that are doing this.

20:50.344 --> 20:58.993
Certainly we have set the pace in environmental archaeology, and I think we're still doing a very good job in this area.

20:59.952 --> 21:04.496
We could, in fact, we are trying to expand into the areas of physical and cultural.

21:06.819 --> 21:21.953
I guess the only thing is to just try to stay abreast of what's going on in the world and try to meet the challenges that will place our graduate students in a good position for employment.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.977
Certainly the high-tech revolution is here,

21:26.429 --> 21:35.720
I know some of the faculty have been, had to be dragged into the high-tech world while others are out in the front of doing this.

21:36.981 --> 21:44.150
We have recently embarked on a program with the Conservation Research Laboratory.

21:45.231 --> 21:56.284
We have the first two patents in the College of Liberal Arts, which have been awarded to faculty members in our college, Wayne Smith and Donny Hamilton.

21:56.551 --> 22:06.546
And this all has to do with a new technique of preservation using silicon as opposed to other commodities.

22:06.706 --> 22:20.146
In the past, they've generally used various kinds of, oh, they call it PEG, polyethylene glycol, the various kinds of preservatives in the past.

22:20.206 --> 22:26.035
But more recently, they've discovered that silicon is a very good preservative.

22:26.572 --> 22:35.610
We've got two patents on this process, which we think will be adopted by laboratories and commercial enterprises all over the world.

22:35.671 --> 22:40.781
So it's still in its infancy, but I think that this has a very bright future.

22:40.961 --> 22:44.749
So anthropology at A&M is...

22:45.725 --> 22:46.186
It's good.

22:46.646 --> 22:47.428
It's not the best.

22:47.748 --> 22:48.088
It's good.

22:48.149 --> 22:58.664
Of course, the big problem, as you well know, and most of us know, and that is that reputations take a long time to develop, and they also take a long time to dissipate.

23:00.006 --> 23:04.813
There are some universities in the United States which have far exceeded their prime.

23:05.182 --> 23:14.585
and yet are still looked upon as highly respected universities, even though their faculty and their facilities have decayed quite rapidly.

23:14.605 --> 23:18.955
And there are other institutions, which have been rising very quickly

23:19.070 --> 23:28.660
But when they go out to survey, they don't get mentioned because the people they survey are generally people that have graduated from the old-time institution.

23:28.721 --> 23:34.407
So, in essence, what I'm saying is I think we're better than what people think we are.

23:35.108 --> 23:41.394
Would we, are, have there been any, are there any national rankings of anthropology programs?

23:41.855 --> 23:42.135
Yes.

23:43.276 --> 23:48.402
There are several national rankings, and we're not ranked on any one of them.

23:48.382 --> 23:51.185
This could be for several reasons.

23:51.305 --> 23:56.549
First of all, most of these rankings are based strictly on doctoral performance.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.273
The fact that we entered the doctoral program in 1989.

24:00.453 --> 24:02.615
Okay, so we're so new.

24:02.635 --> 24:07.439
And the fact that we didn't even get our PhD in cultural or physical until the mid-90s.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.383
And most of these things are based on the last 10 years.

24:11.923 --> 24:12.023
Sure.

24:12.043 --> 24:16.127
So quite honestly, I don't even think that we would be qualified.

24:16.833 --> 24:22.347
for even being considered to be ranked until maybe the next 10 years or so.

24:23.710 --> 24:27.821
In the Southwest, who else does doctoral programs?

24:27.841 --> 24:33.154
Well, you can get a doctorate in anthropology at the university, well, LSU University.

24:33.758 --> 24:37.706
They have a combined Department of Geography and Anthropology.

24:38.948 --> 24:43.016
University of Arkansas offers a PhD in Anthropology.

24:43.698 --> 24:50.451
University of New Mexico and also New Mexico State offers PhDs in Anthropology.

24:50.431 --> 25:04.332
Those would be, I mean you go over to Arizona, you've got Flagstaff offers it, that's Arizona's, that's Northern Arizona, Arizona State and Tempe does and so does the University of Arizona.

25:04.352 --> 25:05.855
That's a big area too.

25:05.875 --> 25:09.300
So then of course Colorado and so forth.

25:09.854 --> 25:19.311
You know, we can, except for Arizona, University of Arizona Tucson, I think we're very competitive with all the rest of those that I've named.

25:20.273 --> 25:25.823
University of Arizona Tucson has long been considered in the top five.

25:26.624 --> 25:33.617
And then in Texas, the University of Texas, and are we competitive with all the others in Texas?

25:34.525 --> 25:37.368
Well, again, it depends on what you want to rank.

25:37.588 --> 25:43.375
If you're going to rank us by cultural anthropology, University of Texas has us hands down.

25:43.395 --> 25:43.595
Sure.

25:44.216 --> 25:44.957
Or linguistics.

25:46.018 --> 25:53.927
If you're ranking us by archaeology, I think we could very easily be ranked number one in archaeology because we have more archaeologists.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.409
We do more archaeology.

25:56.009 --> 25:59.593
We have more diverse faculty that teach archaeology.

26:00.535 --> 26:03.638
Certainly in Nautical, there is no competition whatsoever.

26:04.276 --> 26:10.745
And then compared to the others in the state, then we would be ahead of the SMU, Houston, Rice?

26:11.626 --> 26:13.929
I would say so, yeah, particularly in archaeology.

26:13.990 --> 26:22.381
I think, I really believe, and I'm not saying that just because I'm here at A&M, but I really think in terms of archaeology, we should be ranked number one.

26:23.162 --> 26:28.630
Have, are there some women on the faculty in the anthropology program?

26:29.605 --> 26:29.946
Yes.

26:30.306 --> 26:32.530
The fourth faculty member we hired was a woman.

26:32.850 --> 26:33.932
It was Cynthia Gillette.

26:34.633 --> 26:35.996
She came from Cornell University.

26:36.617 --> 26:43.709
She stayed here for about five years, married a political scientist, and then they both left.

26:43.749 --> 26:44.610
Oh.

26:45.097 --> 26:56.376
Anyway, then later on, we were fortunate to get Sylvia Greider, who had been in the Department of English, and we got her moved over.

26:56.416 --> 27:00.523
She was a folklorist in English, and we got her moved from English over to anthropology.

27:00.689 --> 27:05.914
Then we hired Kathy Detweiler, who is a nutritionist, physical anthropologist.

27:06.595 --> 27:11.159
And more recently, we've hired Lori Wright, who is a physical anthropologist.

27:11.179 --> 27:15.283
So we currently have three women on the faculty, which has helped.

27:15.864 --> 27:21.710
And in fact, we just hired, I'm sorry, we just hired a new faculty member who will start in September.

27:21.730 --> 27:23.351
I got her name.

27:24.593 --> 27:26.955
But anyway, we just hired her this summer.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.038
Now what have we left out that you had on your

27:30.828 --> 27:40.585
I really, the only thing that, the only other thing that I think I would mention is that

27:42.691 --> 27:56.565
Remember, I said that way back when I was a graduate student and working on my Ph.D., Ralph Selecki, who was then chair of the department at Columbia University, and invited me to go to Lebanon and work with him in Lebanon, and I had turned it down.

27:56.705 --> 28:06.975
But Ralph Selecki and I became good friends, and every time I'd go to New York to visit my wife's relatives, I would stop by Columbia University, and we would have lunch and chat and everything.

28:07.056 --> 28:11.500
So over the next 10, 15 years, we became good friends.

28:12.290 --> 28:24.682
When he retired from Columbia University in 1988, right around 1988, he was looking for a place to go.

28:24.702 --> 28:30.468
He asked if maybe Texas A&M might be interested in having him come down.

28:31.909 --> 28:33.071
Now, who is Ralph Selecki?

28:33.251 --> 28:36.234
Well, Ralph Selecki wrote the book on Neanderthals.

28:36.974 --> 28:39.597
He excavated a site in Iraq.

28:39.577 --> 28:50.434
called Shenandar in 1940, late 1940s, where they found more Neanderthal skulls than they had ever found anywhere else in the world.

28:50.454 --> 28:55.722
And even today, it still stands as probably the most important Neanderthal site ever.

28:55.742 --> 28:56.964
And of course, it's in Iraq now.

28:57.024 --> 28:58.767
It's not, you can't get back to it.

28:58.747 --> 29:05.601
But anyway, so he wrote the book on Neanderthals and is really world famous.

29:06.423 --> 29:11.032
So I invited him to come to Texas A&M as an adjunct faculty member, he and his wife.

29:11.112 --> 29:16.924
His wife is also a Ph.D., Rose Slecki, S-O-L-E-C-K-I.

29:16.904 --> 29:25.102
She is a specialist in the, well, the Neolithic period, really, farming, early farming period.

29:25.142 --> 29:30.514
He's a specialist in the Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic Neanderthals.

29:31.476 --> 29:36.988
So they came down here in 1978 or 2009 and brought with them

29:37.441 --> 29:45.451
eight tons of lithic material from Shenandoah.

29:46.152 --> 29:53.701
We still have the biggest collection of Neanderthal tools anywhere in the world.

29:53.821 --> 29:55.203
Well, I shouldn't say anywhere in the world.

29:55.263 --> 29:57.466
Baghdad has the other half of the collection.

29:58.647 --> 30:01.491
But anyway, outside of Iraq anyway.

30:02.602 --> 30:07.935
And Selecky stayed here up until last fall in September of last year.

30:07.975 --> 30:15.092
After being here for 10 years, he and his wife decided that they were getting up in years.

30:15.545 --> 30:27.407
and wanted to go back to Pennsylvania where their children live and where their grandchildren live and wanted to spend the rest of their years up there playing grandfather and grandmother.

30:27.427 --> 30:36.424
And so they really enjoyed their 10 years here at Texas A&M, contributed a lot to our program, certainly gave us good name recognition.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.267
They were on a number of graduate committees.

30:38.367 --> 30:39.409
They taught courses.

30:39.389 --> 30:47.419
And they gave us their intertall collection, so that's really the only other big thing that I might have left out.

30:47.819 --> 31:02.798
Let's see, did any outsider, meaning campus administrator, board member, state official, somebody else ever try to intervene in the department?

31:04.516 --> 31:06.079
Tell them what to do, where to go.

31:06.139 --> 31:20.584
The only incident that I honestly can think of was that one case where I told you about Ordon Ordon and the monkey, where somebody had written to the president.
