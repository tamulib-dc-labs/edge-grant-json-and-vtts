WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:31.489
We got up near the Teutoburger Wall and there's a 
road running

00:02.495 --> 00:31.489
perpendicular to our advance and that happened to 
be the outer perimeter road of a Panzer training

00:02.495 --> 00:31.489
center, German tank training center, at which 
time we would come under heavy tank fire. I

00:33.190 --> 01:01.594
deployed all the tanks units the infantry got 
itself married up with the tanks and the artillery

00:33.190 --> 01:01.594
began to take them under fire and we had quite a tank 
battle there my own personal tank knocked out one

00:33.190 --> 01:01.594
German tank at 1500 yards and another one that 
turned its gun out of some small fir trees at 75

01:02.603 --> 01:06.890
yards. 75 yards? 75 yards. That's probably the 
closest one you ever shot at. That's the closest I

01:12.459 --> 01:14.222
was ever in. Closest one I ever shot at. Did you 
shoot at him? We shot at him. I didn't even give a

01:19.009 --> 01:22.595
chance to give the gunner orders. He just happened 
to be looking through the scope when he saw this

01:22.655 --> 01:28.965
barrel turn around and I pressed the mic button to 
tell him and at that time the gun went off and killed

01:29.367 --> 01:33.772
that thing. That was Sergeant Cooley. The story 
about Sergeant Cooley, he had a brother that was in

01:36.334 --> 01:56.775
the maintenance part of the regiment and he was a 
cook and he became the head mess sergeant in my

01:36.334 --> 01:56.775
headquarters company and war was going pretty 
pretty well we were in the pursuit and

01:57.700 --> 02:10.880
exploitation phase as we were at this particular 
time and he just had to get out of that kitchen he

01:57.700 --> 02:10.880
said. These were mobile kitchens and he had been a 
good tank gunner as a corporal but we also you know

02:10.940 --> 02:23.639
you need a mess sergeant so he had been promoted up 
to mess sergeant. He wanted to go along as my tank

02:26.152 --> 02:39.787
gunner on one episode one exploitation move and I 
told him that if he could get permission from my

02:26.152 --> 02:39.787
crew that I'd be happy to have him. So he got 
permission from the crew and this was his he he got

02:41.469 --> 02:49.999
in this tank and started when we crossed the Rhine 
River. So he had had five days and nights without

02:54.328 --> 03:01.878
any sleep, and now he had come on, and we were going 
all night again. So he knocked out this tank of

03:01.998 --> 03:05.943
1,500 meters. It was kind of up on a hill. He shot it 
into the track, and she started smoking, and the

03:07.204 --> 03:12.291
crew got out. And then he got this one at 75 meters. 
The next day at noon, we had bypassed the Tudor

03:16.625 --> 03:28.997
Burger Wall, got through it, and we're moving out, 
and he called me and he said, sir, I would like now to

03:16.625 --> 03:28.997
go back to be mess sergeant. I said, not until this 
battle's over, you're doing too well.

03:41.348 --> 03:42.049
What do you say to that? Well, he stayed with me, of 
course. But he was a very proud guy. How many

03:47.624 --> 03:52.429
casualties did you take in this tank battle? I 
never lost a tank. Never lost a tank, never lost a

03:55.252 --> 03:57.575
man. The only two guys that got really in serious 
trouble was a division commander. We were

04:04.282 --> 04:13.412
engaging in this tank battle and stuff was coming 
back and forth, back and forth on this parallel

04:04.282 --> 04:13.412
road and a truck came down this road. And I told the 
recon units, I said, now wait until this truck gets

04:14.202 --> 04:21.913
right down in front of us and then blow it away with 
.50 caliber. And about that time, this guy punched

04:21.933 --> 04:26.861
me on the shoulder and he said, what's going on 
here? And at that time, they shot this truck up 50

04:28.063 --> 04:34.252
yards away out here on this road. You can see it. And 
it turned and swerved and the ground was wet and it

04:35.954 --> 04:41.222
was loaded with German wax. And it's carried... 
scattered dead and wounded women all over the

04:42.316 --> 04:45.101
road. And this guy said, what's going on here? I 
said, look, you old son of a bitch. I said, don't you

04:50.913 --> 04:56.023
know that there's a battle going on here, and you 
get the hell out of here. Who'd you say that to now?

04:58.447 --> 05:01.694
The division commander, the two-star general. 
Oh, okay. And he told General Patton later after

05:02.077 --> 05:15.647
the war, he said, this is the greatest battalion 
commander in the war, he said, and he's also the

05:02.077 --> 05:15.647
only guy that ever called me a son of a bitch and got 
by with it. As a division commander. Would you

05:17.062 --> 05:28.394
believe that— Did your division commander call 
you up or was he— No, he'd come up on a jeep, come up

05:17.062 --> 05:28.394
through the area, traveling all night back there, 
coming up behind me. To get up to you and find out

05:28.414 --> 05:32.158
what the heck was going on. And he got up there and we 
were in this battle. So

05:36.823 --> 05:46.393
he said, and General Patton said, well, what'd you 
do, I.D.? ? He said, I did just like he told me. I got

05:49.597 --> 05:50.679
the hell out of there. So...

05:52.901 --> 06:01.433
We went on down a little ways, and here they... 
Here, I looked around, and I'm in my tank now. We're

06:10.024 --> 06:11.466
fighting and moving. And here is a guy behind me 
with... in a Jeep. And I looked around there. About

06:22.365 --> 06:24.608
that time, Cooley killed his tank. I saw this tank 
gun come out of this fir tree right over there. And

06:28.974 --> 06:33.500
Cooley saw him at the same time, and without any 
order, they just blew him all to hell. Hit around,

06:33.880 --> 06:38.086
hit under the edge of the turret, blew it out. And I

06:40.549 --> 06:45.456
looked around. And this brigadier was in the road 
ditch out of his jeep. The driver was laying on the

06:51.454 --> 06:55.300
road and he was in the ditch. So I jumped out of my 
tank. I said, oh my God, somebody has killed our

06:58.404 --> 07:05.634
assistant division commander. So I get out there. 
I run where he is. I said, what? I said, General

07:12.985 --> 07:14.667
Hines? His name was Sid Hines, H-I-N-D-S. And I 
said, General Hines, you all right? He said, yes,

07:20.520 --> 07:24.810
but this is too close for an old man. And he got in 
that Jeep, and whew, he took off. Well, that was a

07:29.941 --> 07:30.883
good day. Was his driver killed? No, no one. They 
were falling right behind my tank, protecting my

07:38.599 --> 07:42.023
tank. And when my tank gun went off, you know, and 
the blast out of that muzzle brake comes off, boy,

07:42.123 --> 07:51.174
that is hair-raising. They got in the ditch. They 
didn't know what was happening. And he took off.

07:59.964 --> 08:01.326
But we... We proceeded on. And you didn't lose one 
tank. Not one single tank. Not one single soldier.

08:09.682 --> 08:13.406
You didn't lose a soldier, and how many German 
tanks did you knock out?

08:17.431 --> 08:18.252
Not very many. Most of them were retreating and 
getting away from us. I would say in a 56-mile day, a

08:25.139 --> 08:31.026
big day, we made 56 miles in the pursuit. And

08:31.310 --> 08:42.303
we may have knocked out 10 or 11 vehicles of 
different types, that's all. Most thin-skinned

08:42.323 --> 08:48.350
vehicles were rear guard trying to get away, 
leaving infantry behind. And the infantry was

08:48.491 --> 08:52.816
firing bazookas at us from houses and all that sort 
of stuff. Oh, were they? Yeah, yeah. So that must

08:56.580 --> 08:58.102
have been kind of dangerous. Oh, it was very hairy. 
This Sergeant Happy— was in an armored car and a guy

09:01.853 --> 09:20.065
from a tree at about 75 meters only less than 75 
meters fired a Panzerfaust a rocket anything

09:01.853 --> 09:20.065
rocket called Panzerfaust now shaped charge and 
it hit the ring of his M8 armored car, which it has a

09:20.703 --> 09:32.219
.50 caliber on, on the M8 armored car, four-wheel 
armored car, very likely, and he hit the ring,

09:20.703 --> 09:32.219
burned a hole, so he could kill Sergeant Happy. 
Now, Sergeant Happy was in his eighth campaign. He

09:36.164 --> 09:38.126
had landed in Africa with us. That's a hell of a 
loss, you know. A hell of a loss for anybody to lose

09:41.591 --> 09:47.900
any soldier, but a guy that's gone through that 
much, you know. So we lost him. We got involved with

09:49.829 --> 09:51.250
it. So most of the resistance then by this time was 
light and scattered. Light and scattered and

09:55.714 --> 10:09.287
mostly infantry with some light vehicles and 
equipment and most of it anti-tank gun, handheld

09:55.714 --> 10:09.287
rockets, anti-tank rockets. Why weren't they 
surrendering? They knew they were beat. Well,

10:12.330 --> 10:19.296
they were trying to surrender but I have to give you 
an example of what happened. I ran into, I stayed

10:19.681 --> 10:29.050
right with the reconnaissance element.

10:29.070 --> 10:31.573
And we started drawing small arms fire. And one guy 
stepped behind a tree and I pulled out a carbine

10:32.153 --> 10:37.358
rifle to shoot him. It snapped and I threw it down in 
the road ditch. I never did pick it up and I killed

10:39.881 --> 10:42.483
him with a pistol. I could wear a pistol here and one 
down here. If you're inside a tank, you can't get at

10:45.086 --> 10:48.169
this one. So you've got to have something you can 
get at so you want a shoulder holster. If you're

10:52.410 --> 10:54.554
down on the ground— Why didn't he shoot you? Huh? 
Why didn't he shoot you? Well, he did raise to shoot

10:56.016 --> 10:59.521
me, but I just happened to beat him to the draw. No 
kidding? Yeah. How far away was he? He was about 30

11:04.588 --> 11:08.594
yards, 30, 40 yards. He stepped out from behind a 
tree and raised his rifle, and this old carbine

11:08.634 --> 11:15.203
snapped, and I just grabbed this pistol and fired 
it. And at this time you were in what, a jeep? I was in

11:18.162 --> 11:19.123
a jeep. And the other guy dropped his rifle and gave 
up. Hayes, my radio operator in a jeep, Sergeant

11:24.968 --> 11:32.175
Hayes was a fluent speaker of German. He had a lot of 
help. John Rossell from Cleveland, he was a driver

11:34.357 --> 11:41.243
and a courageous guy. So, Hayes got the word They 
had a whole regiment out there and they wanted to

11:45.659 --> 11:48.082
give up. But they couldn't give up because the SS in 
the next village was forcing them to fight. See the

11:59.396 --> 12:06.224
SS threatening them and so, but they'd give up. The 
whole regiment would give up. They didn't want to

12:10.269 --> 12:11.430
fight. So I told Hayes, I said, okay, Hayes, get the 
best location you can on this damn place where they

12:12.878 --> 12:19.368
are in this village from this guy. He wasn't quite 
certain, but he knew that they were in about the

12:19.428 --> 12:35.893
center of town in a building that had a wooden fence 
around it, farm implements inside, animals

12:19.428 --> 12:35.893
inside, and they were staying inside the house, 
and they were up in the loft operating the radio. I

12:38.036 --> 12:40.219
said, Hayes, give me a... Let's stick one other man 
with us here. You guys take more." But I said, I

12:48.938 --> 12:56.645
think that

12:48.938 --> 12:56.645
they said ten or twelve of them in there. I said, 
we'll slip around down there. We'll get behind

12:59.308 --> 13:03.191
this village and we'll take these guys on. 
Meantime, I told columns spread out. get off the

13:10.000 --> 13:28.985
road, get themselves deployed, that I was going to 
see if I couldn't get this regiment to surrender,

13:10.000 --> 13:28.985
draw up the artillery, and here's where I'm going, 
and cover me, and I'd call for artillery if I

13:10.000 --> 13:28.985
needed, or whatever tank, whatever I needed. So,

13:29.105 --> 13:37.797
this village was about a mile away. So we went off 
down to Hearts Mountain, which is on my right

13:40.021 --> 13:46.632
flank. I go off down there and I found a, we go across 
the field, we go down in the low land, we come along

13:46.652 --> 14:02.097
and we get on up, myself, one recon sergeant, 
Hayes, and Rochelle, we go on up. We go back about a

14:03.238 --> 14:07.345
mile behind this place and we come in behind it. And 
just outside town we find a guy with a horse and a

14:09.434 --> 14:21.187
small wagon filled with loaves of bread. A German? 
German. So we snatch him

14:26.533 --> 14:33.701
and we make him tell us where this place is. As a 
matter of fact, We go up within one block of where

14:37.210 --> 14:43.799
this is and make him point this out. Then Rochelle, 
Hayes, and Sergeant Sullivan, I believe it was, a

14:43.819 --> 14:53.512
recon sergeant. I'm armed with a Tommy gun, and I 
still wear my two pistols. Others are armed. Hayes

15:01.503 --> 15:06.289
has a Tommy gun, and Sergeant has an M1 and a pistol. 
and we all got grenades.

15:11.549 --> 15:14.893
So we go up there and this German pointed out— You go 
into the city then? Oh yeah, it's a small village.

15:17.476 --> 15:20.379
One road goes through it and houses off to the right 
and left. Farming area. All the farmers live in

15:21.480 --> 15:25.785
here, you see, and they farm the lands out there. 
And there's a whole regiment of Germans in there?

15:29.249 --> 15:32.032
Only twelve SS guys. Twelve SS are here in the 
village. And my troops are out there and the German

15:37.960 --> 15:42.407
regiment's out here. So I work my way all the way 
around here and I come back in the back way. So we go

15:47.935 --> 15:48.776
in there. Satisfied that that's the place. How 
many of you snuck in there? Four of us. Why did you go

15:56.728 --> 15:58.450
if you're the commander? I just got the 
information. And I want to go. You don't waste time

16:06.125 --> 16:09.829
waiting to put a team together and so on and so 
forth. You deploy everybody, tell the force what

16:09.850 --> 16:15.857
you're going to do, and then you go do it. Well, who 
was in charge? Who'd you leave in charge of? I left

16:17.999 --> 16:21.884
my deputy in charge, my executive in charge. He's 
in the half track in the command center with my S-3

16:24.027 --> 16:33.398
and my S-2 and my S-1.

16:36.550 --> 16:42.337
So we go in there, we knock this wooden door down, 
and we start spraying this thing. So we kill them

16:42.377 --> 16:44.019
all but four. And these were all SS? SS, all SS. We 
put the— Dark uniforms and all that? Yeah, we put

16:50.267 --> 17:02.322
the four SS, they're not dead, with their hands 
behind their head, walking them in front of the

16:50.267 --> 17:02.322
jeep, out in the regiment, the whole regiment 
gives up white flags.

17:07.870 --> 17:11.294
And these guys had given up. Funny thing happened. 
So the whole regiment? The whole regiment. There

17:16.139 --> 17:26.330
was only about 1,600, 1,700 of them, and all of them 
older people called Volkstrom's regiment,

17:16.139 --> 17:26.330
People's regiment. So they were pretty much 
militia. Oh, yeah, sure. They were lucky to have

17:29.793 --> 17:31.816
that, I guess, at that point in time. They were in 
their 40s and above. Yeah, that's right. And they

17:33.557 --> 17:34.979
were not eager to fight anyway. Not eager to fight. 
I didn't want to kill people like that so we did this

17:36.355 --> 17:57.891
very swiftly very quickly and believe it or not a 
funny story that I heard the next day was that we

17:36.355 --> 17:57.891
made them stack up their rifles you know and 
armored elements have no way of carrying

17:36.355 --> 17:57.891
prisoners and oftentimes we get accused of The 
paratroopers and the armored people get accused

17:58.799 --> 18:06.449
of killing prisoners because they got no way to 
take care of them. They're often accused of that,

18:08.071 --> 18:11.255
but that's not true. What we do in armored elements 
is we tell them to stack their weapons up, put their

18:11.315 --> 18:18.364
hands behind their head, and start walking to the 
rear. A soldier is a soldier, and there's honor

18:20.627 --> 18:28.317
among soldiers.

18:29.107 --> 18:54.237
always exceptions of course but amongst these 
people they didn't want to fight in the first place

18:29.107 --> 18:54.237
so they're not gonna bother anybody we stack up 
their weapon lo and behold the adjunct of the

18:29.107 --> 18:54.237
regiment was coming forward

18:29.107 --> 18:54.237
in his Jeep with his driver to bring mail or 
something And he's a nice, timid little man,

18:56.731 --> 18:59.594
officer. That's the reason he's the adjutant, you 
know, of the regiment. And lo and behold, he looks

19:05.220 --> 19:11.366
here, and here are all these Germans coming down 
the damn road. So he gets his .45 out and recaptures

19:11.867 --> 19:14.990
them. And it's getting dark, and he does not know 
what to do, and his radio and his jeep isn't

19:17.272 --> 19:24.460
working, and he's scared to death. So the story 
goes is that he got in the middle and made the

19:25.267 --> 19:33.118
Germans march around him all night long.

19:38.446 --> 19:41.350
Somebody come along at first light and helped him 
out. He had captured a whole regiment

19:42.432 --> 19:44.936
single-handed. I

19:44.956 --> 19:53.468
thought that was funny when I heard that. What did 
the general say? What did White say? Oh, God, they

19:57.551 --> 20:00.355
laughed about that for weeks. Still laughing 
about it, I guess.

20:06.984 --> 20:10.248
Were you and your other three men recommended for a 
decoration?

20:13.092 --> 20:15.936
I think the division commander gave us silver 
stars. It was pretty bloody in there for a while.

20:20.162 --> 20:20.843
They were shooting them. We were shooting them. 
Did you lose any of your men? No, not a scratch.

20:26.789 --> 20:27.130
Really? Not a scratch. You just, all four of you? 
Blasted, blasted. Throwing the grenades in the

20:32.257 --> 20:36.463
house, throwing the grenades here and blasting. 
You pick these guys up, the ones on the radio up

20:36.483 --> 20:42.070
here, we just cut them out and they rolled out of 
that hayloft down on the ground. One come out of the

20:43.552 --> 20:49.881
basement there that had been wounded and Hayes 
told him to get his hands up. He tried to spit on

20:50.198 --> 20:57.688
Hayes, and that's when I pulled his pistol and cut 
him from right here, right all the way down through

20:50.198 --> 20:57.688
here. Because nobody spits on my sergeant. Not 
even America. So I cut him across the head here with

21:04.457 --> 21:10.384
my .45, and then he got his hands up. But those SS are 
awful surly, disciplined, tough cookies. Tough

21:17.374 --> 21:19.176
cookies, and black suitors. tough cookie. But 
that regiment got up and moved out. What did you

21:26.993 --> 21:30.038
feel like when you were going into this barn? Well, 
I felt like you're gonna win or you don't go. You

21:37.171 --> 21:43.041
felt like you're gonna be successful or you just 
don't tackle anything like that. And you had so

21:43.962 --> 21:44.944
much experienced by this time in your seventh or 
eighth campaign in three years that you get a

21:45.987 --> 21:58.584
little bit careless, but if you get too careless, 
you're going to end up dead. But also, you've got to

22:00.246 --> 22:12.642
remember that you've been through a lot, you've 
learned a lot, and if you apply it properly, you're

22:00.246 --> 22:12.642
a pretty tough cookie yourself, you know. And 
you're not afraid to take anybody on. really and it

22:15.991 --> 22:42.032
does so much for your soldier you know if the 
officer never asked a soldier to do anything that

22:15.991 --> 22:42.032
he hasn't done or won't do himself that's you gain 
their respect and confidence and I'm telling you

22:42.670 --> 23:11.428
when you gain the respect and the confidence of an 
American soldier and he's trained you're going to

22:42.670 --> 23:11.428
see it he's trained you gain his respect and 
confidence uh there's no end to what you can't do I

22:42.670 --> 23:11.428
mean you can take on the greatest odds you've ever 
seen there isn't any question about that in my mind

22:42.670 --> 23:11.428
because This guy called American, he makes the 
finest fighting man there is.

23:23.594 --> 23:30.462
He may not be—he's

23:23.594 --> 23:30.462
a poor fighter if he isn't led well. He's a poor 
fighter if he isn't led well. But if he's led well,

23:35.747 --> 23:40.032
there's no end to what he can't do. And won't do. And 
once you jumped into this place and started

23:41.783 --> 23:50.736
shooting, these guys, which were obviously 
outmanned, they didn't have any machine guns,

23:41.783 --> 23:50.736
they started shooting back? They had very 
sub-machine guns. Most all of them had

23:55.123 --> 24:00.350
sub-machine guns.

24:01.131 --> 24:02.133
Pistols they wore. But there was no time for 
pistols when you were faced with Tommy guns, .45

24:04.256 --> 24:10.525
caliber Tommy guns. with 20 and 30 round clips. We 
got rid of the old drum, 50 caliber drum, because we

24:15.090 --> 24:38.959
had so many stoppages and so hard to carry and but 
with the 20 and 30 round clips or magazines you

24:15.090 --> 24:38.959
could stick them in your pockets, you could tie 
them, you could put tape on them hand to hand with 20

24:15.090 --> 24:38.959
rounds here and turn the thing over another you got 
40 rounds right there hanging on the gun. And it's a

24:40.238 --> 24:46.466
good round for close range, a .45 caliber is a good 
round for close range. I can't believe that this

24:46.486 --> 24:50.812
one guy actually spit after it was all over. Well, 
he wouldn't have come out of the building there,

24:50.872 --> 24:54.337
you know. What the hell was going on? Did you 
actually go into the building or did you stay out

24:56.940 --> 24:59.824
and shoot in? We just threw grenades inside the 
house, opened the door and dropped grenades,

25:01.487 --> 25:09.958
rolled them down the basement down there. And

25:11.170 --> 25:15.937
didn't have to go in. They started coming out of 
there. Found out that they were all out.

25:24.491 --> 25:28.817
And so this guy actually— Oh yeah, he spit at Hayes 
and that's when he got cut. Got his head busted open

25:29.038 --> 25:32.503
with a lot of pistols.

25:35.302 --> 25:46.496
I had Captain Einbeck, his family came from 
Einbeck, Germany, and when we took that place,

25:35.302 --> 25:46.496
when I took that place, he wanted to go back and look 
for his aunt or uncle. Now that was against the

25:46.516 --> 25:53.125
rules for us to allow our soldiers to go look for 
their ancestry over there. You had some pretty

25:54.146 --> 25:56.108
close ancestry. And damn good ancestry. I finally 
told Einbeck he could go. I said, yeah, go back to

26:04.300 --> 26:07.504
the town of Einbeck. His aunt and uncle lived 
there, and his mother's sister.

26:20.584 --> 26:21.325
He went back. He finally found them.

26:26.365 --> 26:32.211
but he was sorry about going back and looking for 
them because they give him the same sort of

26:26.365 --> 26:32.211
treatment. He had to just turn and walk away. They 
were not all that way, but some were. But we— Wait,

26:41.681 --> 26:46.746
how'd you get along with just the German refugees 
themselves? You must have just streamed past

26:47.727 --> 26:50.510
them. Oh, we got along with them. I tell you what, 
they were a troublesome lot, particularly a

26:51.931 --> 26:55.815
displaced person. Yeah. Displaced persons were a 
worrisome lot. First off, they were all hungry and

27:00.909 --> 27:16.234
when you give them rations most of them become very 
ill with diarrhea because they hadn't had

27:00.909 --> 27:16.234
anything to eat and then when And you had to keep 
guards on them because if you didn't, they'd go out

27:16.501 --> 27:26.116
and ransack every German village, kill every cow, 
kill every horse. They were just mad people. Just

27:28.459 --> 27:29.621
mad people. So you had to keep them under control 
and then the reaction you got, well here you come

27:29.661 --> 27:39.696
you great liberators and now you're treating us 
just like the Germans did. You see? So it's a sort of

27:41.098 --> 27:45.445
problem that I guess there are many approaches to 
how you handle dispersed people that's been in

27:47.247 --> 28:10.276
prison for a long time and mistreated and no food 
and they're kind of wild because they're very

27:47.247 --> 28:10.276
destructive if they're left alone as a group and 
you can't help that happen.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.583
So it's a difficult thing to figure out just how to 
handle it. And they were interested in revenge

28:18.561 --> 28:20.663
against the Germans? Absolutely, totally, 
totally. And were there incidences that you had to

28:23.306 --> 28:25.408
stop? Oh yeah, they got stealing cows, ramsacking 
the places. They were, I believe the displaced

28:31.113 --> 28:38.080
people were as bad as the Soviets. Soviets,

28:38.100 --> 28:45.587
they ramsacked every house and every cellar took 
every jar of food that the Germans had been able to

28:46.445 --> 28:51.630
muster together. And the Germans are much like 
Americans, and Americans are much like the

28:53.872 --> 28:59.176
Germans. And we're one and the same in many 
respects. They're great preservers of food

29:02.820 --> 29:14.410
during the food seasons, if they can get their 
hands on it, fresh vegetables and that sort of

29:02.820 --> 29:14.410
stuff, by canning it and storing it and putting it 
away. jellies and jams and that sort of type of

29:15.014 --> 29:32.070
staple, but Soviet soldiers were just ramsacking 
their house stealing everything that they could

29:15.014 --> 29:32.070
get, eating out of these jars and cans. They were, 
it seemed to me that they were almost as starved to

29:32.250 --> 29:39.817
death as the DPs were. Well, we're going to get to 
the Soviets in a minute, but now that we're talking

29:40.658 --> 29:44.481
about refugees and we always have that problem of 
looting. Did you have any examples with your men or

29:51.151 --> 29:59.003
did you hear of any examples in which Americans 
were looting?

30:08.457 --> 30:10.480
I don't think so. Maybe they did. It's a

30:14.566 --> 30:41.012
hard thing to say in war

30:14.566 --> 30:41.012
what

30:14.566 --> 30:41.012
is left

30:14.566 --> 30:41.012
at the end of a day's battle and what it's cost one 
side or the other.

30:44.317 --> 30:57.257
And what

30:44.317 --> 30:57.257
one side feels like it deserves as a result of 
victory or what one feels like it deserves as a

30:44.317 --> 30:57.257
result of the loss of battle. And I guess I'm trying 
to avoid your question because I never saw a

30:59.721 --> 31:07.133
soldier loot anything. Now, maybe they did, but I 
didn't see that. I wasn't looking for that. I was

31:15.355 --> 31:41.323
looking to see that we won the battle and that

31:15.355 --> 31:41.323
I saved as many soldiers' lives as I could and I

31:15.355 --> 31:41.323
was doing the kind of job that I was capable of 
doing. I've heard that soldiers looted.

31:51.167 --> 31:51.848
Maybe they did. Maybe they picked up something and 
found out later that what am I doing with this thing

31:54.331 --> 32:02.539
and throw it away. How much loot can you put on a 
soldier that has 96 pounds of pack and weapon and

32:10.683 --> 32:15.070
ammunition on him. How much loot can he carry? I'm 
just asking. There's another thing that we should

32:20.438 --> 32:26.006
talk about since you were right there on the front 
lines. The Russians even admitted that the amount

32:26.587 --> 32:35.661
of looting that the Red Army did was horrible, and 
also of course the hatred between the Russians and

32:35.962 --> 32:44.673
the Germans was much more intense than between the 
Germans and the Americans, but there was quite a

32:35.962 --> 32:44.673
bit of raping that was going on. What about that? 
Did you have any situations? No, we had a policy of

32:48.338 --> 32:56.709
non-fraternization, and I think everybody stuck 
to that as far as I could tell. I never had a rape

32:56.809 --> 33:03.538
problem.

33:04.717 --> 33:10.524
Anything like that going on out in the battle area, 
I don't know where the women were. There's

33:10.564 --> 33:26.944
some old women out there, and some old men left, and 
I don't know where in the hell the younger people

33:10.564 --> 33:26.944
were, but I don't think any soldier is interested 
in raping some 70-year-old farm woman. I just

33:27.064 --> 33:28.686
didn't have any of it. I told them, well, the rules 
were you just don't do that sort of stuff. and they

33:33.910 --> 33:35.952
didn't do it.

33:38.335 --> 33:43.461
If they had, I'd have dealt with them very harshly 
because they knew there was no in-between with me.

33:44.082 --> 33:48.307
After this surrender, then what? Let's continue 
until the end, until V.E. Day. After the

33:52.031 --> 33:57.918
surrender, we moved from— Was this in February or 
March? No, April. We're talking about April 45.

34:02.598 --> 34:05.983
because I was wounded on the Elbe River on the 11th 
of April. A part of the regiment of Germans came

34:06.144 --> 34:14.176
down from the north and wanted to surrender to me. 
The lieutenant colonel brought his force in, and

34:14.196 --> 34:20.987
he came down under the white flag and wanted to join 
me to go to Berlin. And I said, I've just been more or

34:22.750 --> 34:27.998
less reprimanded for even attempting to cross the 
Elbe River. I didn't know any better, and I fought

34:30.357 --> 34:36.444
all night to try to take this bridge, and I've been 
busted up. I was busted up, but nobody ever told me

34:38.546 --> 34:49.558
that this was going to be the international 
boundary, so I was trying to save the bridge.

34:49.598 --> 34:58.187
Anyway, this German regiment of about 900 people 
came down and wanted to join me to go to Berlin, and I

34:49.598 --> 34:58.187
wish to hell that I had authority to go because I 
took Burrell in about eleven hours and there

34:59.028 --> 35:26.875
wouldn't have been any killing or anything going 
on up there and it would have been a different world

34:59.028 --> 35:26.875
totally different world than the one today but in 
my personal view Mr. Eisenhower and a very sick

34:59.028 --> 35:26.875
president Mr. Roosevelt were bamboozled

35:29.015 --> 35:42.773
by Stalin and the old American position of, let's 
get this war over with and bring our boys home. And

35:44.495 --> 35:51.865
Mr. Bradley, General Bradley saying, oh, it'll 
cost us 100,000 casualties to take Berlin. Well,

35:51.905 --> 35:53.487
that was a bunch of crap. I think I could have took 
Berlin in 11 hours from the 11th of April with those

35:55.306 --> 36:03.597
900 Germans or without them. In about 11 hours, I 
would have been to Berlin, and I don't think there

36:05.779 --> 36:17.795
had been any problem of the whole Berlin giving up 
at that time without any casualties whatsoever.

36:18.636 --> 36:25.144
That was the attitude of the German people, and 
that was the attitude of the German army at the time

36:18.636 --> 36:25.144
because, as I say there, They wanted to go with me to 
Berlin, and they thought that there's nothing but

36:25.445 --> 36:35.220
sense to this business that the United States go to 
Berlin, and they were right. But no, the decision

36:37.384 --> 36:46.698
had been made long before that that we're going to 
give that to the Soviets.

36:46.718 --> 36:51.165
What a hell of a disaster for the American people. 
and you can blame Eisenhower and Roosevelt for

36:52.563 --> 36:59.631
it. What did this German lieutenant colonel say to 
you? He said, I want to join you and go to Berlin with

37:03.595 --> 37:08.140
you.

37:11.164 --> 37:12.745
He wanted to fight with you? He wanted to join us and 
go with us. They knew what the hell was going to

37:16.850 --> 37:18.652
happen. And liberate it? Yeah. Take it before the 
Soviets get there. That's what he told you? Oh,

37:25.808 --> 37:26.289
yeah. They all knew this. Most of these guys, a high 
percentage of them had been on the Eastern Front.

37:38.081 --> 37:40.043
They know the Soviets. They know communism.

37:46.830 --> 37:49.553
I just told him, I said,

37:51.878 --> 37:58.106
I'm not permitted to cross the Elk River and we just 
had casualties trying to get across the Elk River.

38:01.310 --> 38:09.040
A regimental commander, Colonel Paul Disney, 
took a piece of shell fragment in the leg. But

38:11.604 --> 38:17.211
nobody told us that that was an international 
boundary, we're not supposed to cross it.

38:20.887 --> 38:24.351
I said to the German, I said, you put your stuff out 
here. And he said, well, what'll I do with my

38:24.371 --> 38:26.493
troops? I said, line them up out there someplace. 
He said, how about their weapons? I said, you save

38:31.279 --> 38:42.191
enough weapons to safeguard those men and stack 
the rest of them up out in front of your unit there. I

38:42.211 --> 38:44.093
said, how much have you had to eat today? He said, 
our ration today is two small potatoes. I said,

38:50.738 --> 38:59.595
well, what you want to do is get your men lined up out 
here and I'm going to send for a truckload of food

38:50.738 --> 38:59.595
some rations for you. And I did. I called a little 
guy named Sam Smith who was my supply officer and I

39:00.196 --> 39:13.101
said, get a truckload of rations up here for these 
German prisoners. Well, yes, sir, where are they?

39:17.315 --> 39:19.557
I said, well, it doesn't make a damn where they are. 
I said, get the hell on up here, and I'll point out to

39:19.657 --> 39:24.522
you where they are. So they got them up there. We 
give them the whole two-and-a-half-ton

39:25.663 --> 39:29.827
truckload of rations. Of course, they starved to 
death. God mighty. Next day, they were all sick

39:36.092 --> 39:44.100
because the food was too rich for them, the 
C-rations. You know, those sea rations got a

39:45.278 --> 39:57.851
variety of different kinds of food there, but they 
did have some coffee and some cigarettes and some

39:45.278 --> 39:57.851
things like that, and they hadn't had coffee and 
cigarettes in God knows when.

40:00.895 --> 40:02.376
So they were all sick to their stomach? Diarrhea? 
Oh yeah, all over the place.

40:07.422 --> 40:08.543
Just too much for them. They were all too thin? They 
were all real thin? Yeah, they were. Well, you

40:13.708 --> 40:15.150
know, they're strong they're not I don't know how 
to describe a man that gets around to the point that

40:15.890 --> 40:45.508
he doesn't eat very much in his system and justice 
to it but they weren't weaklings you know that's

40:15.890 --> 40:45.508
what I guess I'm trying to say they're still damn 
physical capable of fighting like hell but uh That

40:46.687 --> 40:51.594
gives you some idea about what I felt about our 
prisoners. I tried to take care of them. And that's

40:55.139 --> 40:57.041
where you were when V.E. Day came about. Yeah, 
that's right. You were sitting on the Elbe. That's

41:01.207 --> 41:02.629
right, that's right. Waiting for orders. Waiting 
for orders. Orders were withdraw to Brunswick, so

41:07.015 --> 41:10.720
we withdrew to Brunswick.

41:13.552 --> 41:18.079
And war was over, and the Poles were running all 
over the damn place. Oh, they busted down their

41:18.099 --> 41:25.089
damn cages and, you know, the POW, their Displaced 
Person Cages. God, oh my, they were a mess. And we

41:29.375 --> 41:34.563
immediately started moving into occupation, 
military government. Rounded them up and got

41:34.583 --> 41:41.854
Polish, appointed Polish captains. of labor 
forces give one Pole responsible for looking

41:43.032 --> 41:50.681
after and maintaining order among the Poles. Let 
the Poles argue this thing out themselves, you

41:51.622 --> 41:56.008
know. And they seemed to get a hold of themselves.

42:01.514 --> 42:03.016
How did they respond to Americans? Were they happy 
to see you? Oh, yes. All of the prisoner camps that

42:08.342 --> 42:12.988
were uncovered, which I didn't uncover P.O.W., 
our own P.O.W. camp. We did uncover the D.P. camps.

42:23.814 --> 42:25.878
They were very, very happy. And of course,

42:27.100 --> 42:32.410
we gave them food. Sure, and they got sick. Yeah, 
just couldn't handle it.

42:42.500 --> 42:49.068
funny thing about that stuff.

42:49.088 --> 42:54.335
But, I had a terrible fight on the Elk River when I 
got there. I guess Cornelius Ryan tells it better

42:54.355 --> 42:59.902
than I, because he got his information from 
everybody.

43:05.570 --> 43:06.651
But, I was over living overlooking Schoenbeck 
about five o'clock in the evening on the Elbe River

43:07.171 --> 43:12.858
and there was a bridge there.

43:15.702 --> 43:28.858
And the Germans were moving in a column from south 
to north and going in the town and it's obvious to me

43:15.702 --> 43:28.858
they were trying to get across the Elbe River to get 
out of the way. Tanks, artillery pieces, horse

43:30.700 --> 43:34.545
drawn artillery, truck-drawn artillery, 
personnel carriers filled with people, armored

43:35.555 --> 43:47.493
personnel carriers, headquarters vehicles and 
all that, bumper-to-bumper movement. So I called

43:48.575 --> 44:04.279
Jim Starr, one of my company commanders, and I 
said, I'm going to put a company of infantry on your

43:48.575 --> 44:04.279
back, and I want you to go just at dark and chop that 
column off. I'm going to take the other two

44:06.655 --> 44:08.377
companies. How was he going to get across the Elm? 
They were on this side. Oh, they were on this side.

44:12.681 --> 44:14.763
Yeah, going parallel to the Elm. Oh, I see. Yeah, 
from north to south, from south to north. And they

44:19.848 --> 44:26.815
were going into Schoenbeck, and I knew damn well 
they were crossing that bridge. That bridge was

44:26.835 --> 44:27.936
still open. So I said, Jim, I want you to go We were on 
high ground in defilade position watching all

44:33.706 --> 44:40.853
that. And I said, I want you to go charging down 
there about a mile and a half down there with the

44:40.873 --> 44:48.020
high ground up here overlooking all that. I said, I 
want you to go down there and chop that column in two

44:48.040 --> 44:57.609
and stop it and tear her up or capture her, however 
you can do it. I'm going to go charging in town just

45:02.562 --> 45:26.595
at dark and get in their column

45:02.562 --> 45:26.595
and when they go across that bridge it's going to be 
dark and I'm going to be in their column and I'm

45:02.562 --> 45:26.595
trailing them across and we're going to have that 
and as soon as I get across with the lead company

45:02.562 --> 45:26.595
we're going to hold there with one company on one 
side of the bridge and one company
