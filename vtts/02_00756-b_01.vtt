00:05.448 --> 00:24.300
First, Dr. Quisenberry, tell us something about 
your early life, including the names of your

00:05.448 --> 00:24.300
parents, the places and dates of their birth and 
death, the place and date of your birth, and the

00:05.448 --> 00:24.300
schools you attended before enrolling at Texas 
A&M. Well, I can't give you the dates on my father

00:25.259 --> 00:39.913
and mother's birth and death, but I could give you 
the place of birth. My father was born in McKinney,

00:40.034 --> 00:44.218
Texas. His father migrated to Texas rather early 
in the history of Texas, and he was born there My

00:53.778 --> 01:08.830
mother was born in Tennessee, and they settled in 
Gainesville, Texas, after their marriage, and I

00:53.778 --> 01:08.830
was born in Gainesville. I was the...

01:14.078 --> 01:19.608
I had three brothers and two sisters. I'm next to 
the youngest in the family. I have a sister who is

01:23.975 --> 01:30.487
living in Grand Prairie at the present time who is 
younger than I am. And then when I was two years old,

01:34.852 --> 01:37.979
I was born in June 25, 1907. And when I was two years 
old, that would mean in 1909, my parents moved to

01:38.660 --> 01:48.923
what I call West Texas. It was really Hardeman 
County. at the lower end of the Panhandle, you

01:51.203 --> 01:55.951
know, Texas Panhandle. And they lived on a rented 
farm for a few years, and then my father bought 320

01:56.572 --> 02:11.878
acres of land. The family moved on to this, and we 
attended a rural school at that time. It was called

02:18.555 --> 02:20.679
Friendship School. That was the name of the 
precinct or school. And it was a two-room school.

02:29.375 --> 02:35.024
And then later on, they enlarged it and made a 
three-room school out of it. And I went to this

02:35.765 --> 02:44.099
school until I was in my tenth. Actually, in those 
days, we had eleven grades in Texas. I believe

02:48.325 --> 02:51.771
today we have twelve, but in those days, eleven. 
and I attended through my 10th grade, and they did

02:51.751 --> 03:11.835
not teach the 11th grade, and so I transferred into 
the county seat, Quanna, Texas, for my senior

02:51.751 --> 03:11.835
year, and graduated from Quanna High School in 
1927. Could you give us the names of your parents?

03:17.148 --> 03:31.192
Yes, my mother was, her maiden name was Nancy Lane, 
and my father was Walter Henry Quisenberry, W.H.

03:31.252 --> 03:31.934
Quisenberry. And they...

03:39.220 --> 03:55.184
My father, I'm very bad about memory and dates, but 
my mother died first and she's been dead probably

03:39.220 --> 03:55.184
about ten years and my father's been dead about six 
years, I imagine. What type of farming did your

03:56.346 --> 03:58.950
father do? It was general, diversified farming. 
Most of the crops, the cash crop was majorly

04:02.476 --> 04:18.002
cotton, but he grew also a little bit of corn, not 
much corn, mostly grain sorghum, and then he grew

04:02.476 --> 04:18.002
almost always, if the the

04:17.982 --> 04:22.326
rainfall was adequate. He nearly always had 
wheat, and once in a while he would have a little bit

04:22.927 --> 04:28.312
of oats. But mostly, well I should have said cash 
crop also, the wheat was majorly a cash crop, wheat

04:28.332 --> 04:39.842
and cotton, but the grain sorghum was used for 
feeding. We had dairy cattle where we had a little

04:40.623 --> 04:46.268
more than the milk and butter for the family, and so 
a little bit was sold as cream, usually. And then we

04:53.178 --> 04:57.143
had horses, the early part. In fact, practically 
all through my farming days, we did not have

04:58.145 --> 05:07.978
tractor mechanical power. It was mostly horse and 
mule power.

05:15.560 --> 05:19.765
I guess that is the major essence of it. He had some 
pasture land where the dairy

05:19.785 --> 05:29.757
cattle were turned out for grazing in the grass. 
And then, of course, they were fed usually

05:30.378 --> 05:44.655
cottonseed meal and hulls for protein sources, 
and then probably milo or grain sorghum for their

05:30.378 --> 05:44.655
concentrate.

05:46.525 --> 05:48.568
Did he do any irrigating at all? Not at that time. 
There was no irrigation. We did have a well and a

05:54.174 --> 06:06.930
windmill that supplied the... We didn't have 
electric power extension, REA power at that time.

06:06.910 --> 06:13.800
And so we had a windmill that pumped the water for 
the cattle, for the livestock, let's say. It was,

06:14.562 --> 06:19.209
in that area, the water is what we call gyp water. 
It's a hard, extremely hard water and not very good

06:19.309 --> 06:23.675
for drinking. And so most of our drinking water was 
caught by a gutter on the house and run into a

06:28.122 --> 06:34.988
underground cistern to keep it cool. And that's 
the type of water we drank. And also it was that type

06:38.031 --> 06:47.219
of water was used mostly for washing the dishes and 
the clothes and so on. What factors were involved

06:47.239 --> 06:49.921
in your choice of Texas A&M? Well, I had a county 
agent in my county under whom I had an agriculture

06:57.586 --> 07:03.690
project as a high school youngster. And he was a 
Texas A&M graduate. I also had a vocational

07:08.183 --> 07:11.506
agriculture teacher. I took vocational 
agriculture my senior year in high school as one of

07:11.967 --> 07:21.397
my subjects, and I didn't have a VOAG project as 
such. But he was also from Texas A&M, and I dare say,

07:22.358 --> 07:37.313
if I were real honest, I would say that these two 
people, as in almost every case, the older we get,

07:22.358 --> 07:37.313
the more we realize how important people are in 
this world and how unimportant a lot of other

07:37.664 --> 07:48.153
things that we think earlier is quite important 
becomes, if you part a little philosophy at this

07:37.664 --> 07:48.153
stage. But nevertheless, I think these two men—my 
father had favored—Texas Tech had just been

07:48.654 --> 08:07.671
established a little bit before that, and I think 
living out near in the western part of the state, I

07:48.654 --> 08:07.671
think my father would have probably been a little 
happier if I had gone to Texas Tech. But I think I

08:07.651 --> 08:19.107
definitely preferred to come to A&M myself as far 
as opportunities for coursework and so on were

08:07.651 --> 08:19.107
concerned. And as I said, these two men also 
reinforced any tendency I might have had. I'm a

08:27.378 --> 08:34.535
little bit interested in your comment that you did 
not have an agricultural project in your

08:27.378 --> 08:34.535
Vocational Agriculture course. You remember 
when I took Vocational Agriculture in high

08:35.016 --> 08:38.805
school, it was a requirement. Either you had a 
project or you didn't pass the course. Well, as I

08:44.470 --> 08:47.993
recall it, I may be confused here. I may have been 
mixing up my 4-H county agent project with my VAWAG

08:48.033 --> 08:55.902
project. I know I had Green Sargum as my project in 
high school. This I know. And it may be that I did

09:03.550 --> 09:05.772
some inadvertent switching of the credit for 
that. So I may have also had a requirement at that

09:09.858 --> 09:16.890
time. What were your first reactions to A&M and 
College Station when you arrived? as an incoming

09:22.694 --> 09:24.157
freshman? Well, you're talking to a person that is 
a little bit different from probably the typical

09:24.518 --> 09:33.858
one you'd talk to. It happens that when I was a 
freshman in high school, I came down with

09:33.878 --> 09:42.036
diabetes. And so I was a bit, I had to watch, and I had 
to take insulin. If Banning and Best had not

09:49.919 --> 10:04.378
discovered insulin when they did, if they'd have 
been six months later in discovering and actually

09:49.919 --> 10:04.378
making available on the market, they didn't make 
available at the company, they did. making

10:04.882 --> 10:10.547
available insulin, I would definitely not be 
here. I would have another three months and I would

10:10.727 --> 10:17.614
have been dead because I had already gone before 
the discovery. I'd already gone just about as far

10:18.034 --> 10:21.157
as I could possibly have gone. And so as a result of 
it, I lost almost a year in high school. And then I

10:27.362 --> 10:32.647
started taking insulin. And as long as I was at 
home, I, through my tenth grade, my mother looked

10:35.257 --> 10:44.210
after my diet, a very rich diet. And then in my 
senior year, a very fine couple, a county judge and

10:44.751 --> 10:59.632
his wife, who happened to be, he had married during 
World War I, an English girl. And they invited me to

11:00.613 --> 11:03.998
live in their home in Kwana. And so I cooked my own 
meals and went to school. And so when I came to A&M,

11:08.164 --> 11:26.172
it happened that the county agent, the man I'd had 
as a county agent, had actually been employed as an

11:08.164 --> 11:26.172
instructor in the animal science, or at that time 
it was animal husbandry department, at Texas A&M.

11:26.472 --> 11:37.288
And the instructional unit of the animal 
husbandry department, they had a swine herd. It

11:37.308 --> 11:41.654
was right out in the middle of where the golf course 
is at the present time. And the herdsman for the

11:42.295 --> 11:49.425
swine herd was a veteran. of World War I, and he had 
been severely injured. He'd never married. He was

11:54.803 --> 11:55.664
a bachelor. And he'd been severely injured with 
gas, toxic gas, during World War I. And he lived

12:01.391 --> 12:12.865
there, and this county agent contacted him and 
asked him about the possibility of my having a

12:01.391 --> 12:12.865
room, and so I could prepare my meals. and go to 
school. And he said he'd be delighted to have

12:15.007 --> 12:20.614
company and made it possible. So I came with my 
brothers. Two of my brothers brought me to A&M and

12:23.618 --> 12:31.608
installed me in the residence. And this is the way I 
started the school. And so that was my first

12:35.734 --> 12:38.377
impression. There was no intention of every... 
Well, I knew that advanced education was

12:43.085 --> 12:48.329
essential. I'd probably never be a very 
successful farmer, physically. And so for that

12:53.174 --> 12:58.518
reason, I had made up my mind, this is what had to be. 
Your older brothers, then, I take it, had not gone

12:58.798 --> 13:01.301
to college. No, no. In fact, of my brothers and 
sisters, I'm the only one that graduated from a

13:03.202 --> 13:12.450
university, a college or university. But your two 
older brothers accompanied you to College

13:12.633 --> 13:18.545
Station and installed you in the... They brought 
me here with the necessary utensils for preparing

13:18.666 --> 13:24.237
my meals and so on. So that's what started it. I'm 
assuming you came by train? No, by car, by

13:27.820 --> 13:30.265
automobile. How long a trip was it?

13:35.035 --> 13:37.220
We took two days to come to College Station. We 
stopped on the way in Fort Worth. I spent the night

13:40.888 --> 13:44.455
in Fort Worth and then to College Station the next 
day. Did you stay all four years with this

13:44.616 --> 13:47.702
herdsman? No, I stayed two years with the 
herdsman, and then he became ill and had to quit his

13:47.952 --> 13:57.918
job. He lived over in the hill country, Schertz. or 
Cibolo, Texas, and he had some sisters there. He

14:07.139 --> 14:07.820
went back. And Mr. D.W. Williams, you possibly 
know, he served in almost every capacity in this

14:08.501 --> 14:18.837
institution, including acting chancellor and so 
on. But Mr. D.W. Williams was head of the animal

14:19.458 --> 14:25.367
husbandry department at that time. And when this 
man left the farm, I had to leave the farm

14:25.634 --> 14:33.803
residence. And so Mr. Williams made possible, 
moved some books around and what have you in one of

14:34.483 --> 14:50.700
the rooms here in the old Animal Husbandly Judging 
Pavilion. And he gave me that, called me the

14:50.720 --> 14:55.405
custodian. And incidentally, this is a story that 
is not easy to forget. I lived in this corner of the,

15:02.970 --> 15:11.982
that would be the northeast corner, of the old 
judging pavilion during my junior year. And Tiger

15:12.883 --> 15:22.236
Teague, whom everybody in this county knows, I 
think, lived in the south corner That would be the

15:22.216 --> 15:26.662
southwest corner of the Judging Pavilion. So we 
were in opposite corners of the Judging Pavilion

15:26.682 --> 15:30.246
one year. So we have a lot in common in that regard. 
And where did you live your senior year? The man

15:35.413 --> 15:37.235
came back. He recovered and came back to the swine 
farm. And so he asked me if I wouldn't move back out.

15:46.106 --> 15:51.733
And so I did and lived back at the swine farm during 
my senior year. Were there very many students who

15:52.523 --> 15:56.889
lived outside of the dormitories? Oh, no. Almost 
all of the students lived in the dormitory, and

15:58.251 --> 16:06.282
almost 100% of the students were cadets. I was a 
cadet, but I was a day student. In those days, they

16:11.890 --> 16:17.738
called them day students, those who lived outside 
the dormitories. This is exaggerating a little

16:18.207 --> 16:25.803
bit because I have no justification in terms of the 
treatment I received. But as you know, the old

16:26.605 --> 16:33.600
common statement is that a day student was the 
lowest form of life in those days. But that was not

16:33.580 --> 16:36.223
so in my case. I was in F Company infantry for my two 
years. I couldn't take advanced because, you

16:44.773 --> 16:52.502
know, it required a contract, and being diabetic, 
they would not give me a contract. So I took the

16:52.583 --> 17:02.254
first two years of military science, and I was in F 
Company infantry, and the boys knew why I was a day

16:52.583 --> 17:02.254
student. And they were a very wonderful bunch of 
boys in my organization to me. So for that reason, I

17:08.878 --> 17:17.972
never had any enmity or resentment against the 
Cadet Corps of Military Science. Now, did you

17:17.992 --> 17:19.895
participate in the drill? Yes. Oh, you bet. Yes, 
indeed. I always made drill. I wore the uniform all

17:25.363 --> 17:30.030
the time. and then I participated in the first two 
years. The last two years you wore civilian

17:33.984 --> 17:35.926
clothes? Well, my junior year I wore civilian 
clothes. Then in the senior year,

17:39.370 --> 17:55.748
the college changed its policy and required that 
civilian students wear a uniform. They had what

17:56.318 --> 17:58.585
they called an Aggie uniform. We wore everything, 
the same uniform, except we didn't have the

17:58.645 --> 18:05.005
insignia, the military insignia. So I did... 
rejoin, and since I had to wear a uniform, I

18:09.160 --> 18:31.152
rejoined my military organization and did wear 
the insignia for the—I was not under contract or

18:09.160 --> 18:31.152
anything of that sort, but I did—was back in the 
cadet corps my senior year, but I still was a day

18:09.160 --> 18:31.152
student.

18:34.979 --> 18:38.603
And for all of the four years you cooked all of your 
own meals? Yes, yes indeed. And even though you

18:40.024 --> 18:43.388
were on a strict diet, you also continued to take 
insulin? Yes, oh yes. I still take insulin. I've

18:47.172 --> 18:57.883
taken, probably one of the very few that can say 
that they have taken insulin for more than 50

18:47.172 --> 18:57.883
years, because not very many diabetics live that 
long.

19:01.607 --> 19:02.067
Living... outside the dormitory as you did, say 
particularly in your freshman year and being in

19:02.671 --> 19:15.786
the corps, were, I'm assuming since you were not in 
the dormitory, you were in a sense, excused from or

19:16.390 --> 19:27.945
avoided a lot of the hassling that some of the 
freshmen went through, like making beds and

19:16.390 --> 19:27.945
cleaning rifles and that sort of thing? Yes, they 
did not force me to do this at first until they

19:27.965 --> 19:37.437
learned, until the whole organization learned. 
why I was a day student. I got some of the other

19:41.298 --> 19:52.112
things that, you used a kind word of hassling

19:41.298 --> 19:52.112
on it, but it didn't take very long. The captain of 
the company knew, soon learned, why I was a day

19:52.192 --> 19:57.539
student. And then he informed and probably issued 
a few orders to to particularly the sophomores in

20:03.607 --> 20:07.602
the company.

20:10.412 --> 20:14.427
What did the students of your day do for 
entertainment and recreation? Well, I'll tell

20:16.212 --> 20:24.104
you, in those days, I believe we studied longer 
hours than we do today. I believe the

20:26.547 --> 20:34.018
professors—this would be prejudiced answer—but 
I believe the professors were harder on us than

20:26.547 --> 20:34.018
they are today. Well, I know that the fellows in the 
dormitories had an enforced study period, but of

20:35.661 --> 20:43.873
course you were not in a dormitory. And you had 
somewhat irregular hours from them, I guess. You

20:47.950 --> 20:53.957
did not have an enforced study period, but then you 
also did not have anybody to bother you, I presume.

20:54.057 --> 20:56.661
No, but I did study. And being, I think, probably 
the ability to study without any interference

20:57.622 --> 21:13.101
also made it possible for me to make exceptionally 
good grades.

21:14.397 --> 21:22.689
Did the school provide any kind of entertainment, 
such as movies, theatrical performances, and so

21:14.397 --> 21:22.689
forth? Yes, yes, there was. There were two sources 
of movies. There was the old assembly hall, which

21:29.619 --> 21:35.427
is located now. I believe probably Lowy and 
Puryear dormitories right at the back part of them

21:36.149 --> 21:52.504
was where the old assembly hall was located right 
in there, right opposite where the new hospital

21:36.149 --> 21:52.504
building is. And you had movies there. Yeah, they 
had movies there. I think, I'm not sure whether it

21:57.510 --> 22:01.714
was only weekly or whether it was nightly. This I 
don't know because I didn't go to very many movies

22:01.754 --> 22:05.778
for two reasons. I was in school from 1927 to 1931. 
And you may not be old enough to know, but 1931 was

22:11.584 --> 22:18.171
the... age of the maximum depression that you 
could have. So dollars were very, very scarce

22:24.847 --> 22:31.356
indeed, and so they had to be saved. And you said 
there were two sources. One was the assembly hall.

22:35.261 --> 22:41.009
And I believe that the Guyon Hall at that time was 
also used for some recreational material.

22:45.916 --> 22:47.618
Did you have any favorite instructors?

22:50.922 --> 22:51.403
Yes. I don't know whether if you ask me to name them, 
I'm not sure I could name them all, and I'm not sure

22:51.783 --> 23:04.760
I'd want to name them all, but the answer would be a 
positive yes.

23:11.249 --> 23:15.815
You're probably going to ask me what the 
characteristics of those professors were. Well,

23:16.135 --> 23:18.398
I was going to say if you could name any of them. Did

23:20.116 --> 23:32.083
any of the faculty members have some influence on 
your leaning towards work with poultry? Well, I

23:33.397 --> 23:54.327
think Mr. D.W. Williams, I took a course under him, 
and he was a very excellent professor and helped in

23:33.397 --> 23:54.327
this direction to lean toward animal science, the 
broad field of animal science. Povey came in later

23:54.407 --> 24:00.315
in the graduate level, not as an undergraduate, 
but at the graduate level. And then I can name a

24:00.633 --> 24:07.842
couple more, and I'd like to do it, as a matter of 
fact. My English professor, most ag students, as

24:08.523 --> 24:17.615
you know, are a little reluctant to welcome their 
English courses. But to me, my English courses

24:18.376 --> 24:23.583
were some of my most enjoyable courses. I'd had a 
very excellent English teacher in high school.

24:31.092 --> 24:38.062
So she had been successful in indoctrinating me. 
It wasn't an indoctrination. It was really a

24:40.165 --> 24:45.412
challenge to me to do English well. And so Mr. P.G. 
Gutter was one of my, he's long since dead now, but I

24:48.437 --> 25:00.053
enjoyed Mr. Gutter as a Sunday school teacher 
after I came back here for a number of years on the

24:48.437 --> 25:00.053
faculty. but he was after his retirement, before 
and after his retirement. But he was a very

25:06.580 --> 25:12.908
excellent English teacher, and I enjoyed very 
much courses under him. And then another English

25:13.448 --> 25:18.394
teacher was the former librarian. You probably 
have heard his name, and I don't think you have

25:18.434 --> 25:25.382
probably ever met him, but Tommy Mayo, who was the 
librarian. I had a course, and it was an unusual

25:25.767 --> 25:30.455
course for English. It could well have been taught 
in other departments, but it happened to be taught

25:30.936 --> 25:41.014
in English and taught by a very fine teacher, and it 
was called Modern Civilization. And what we did,

25:41.736 --> 25:49.750
we went through a number of new books describing 
what was to come. And as you can imagine, a

25:50.945 --> 25:57.212
youngster at that age, they liked to use their 
imagination. And so that type of course was quite a

25:57.272 --> 26:01.417
challenge. I remember very distinctly those 
courses as being excellent, very much enjoyed.

26:07.203 --> 26:10.547
And was the Modern Civilization an elective or a 
required course? Oh, no, it's selective. Oh, yes,

26:12.209 --> 26:13.450
selective, yes. But you did have one hour. one year 
of English as a requirement. I believe in those

26:18.315 --> 26:21.658
days we had two years of required English, yes. But 
I took some additional elective courses.

26:33.408 --> 26:40.834
I know that for a long period the entire Corps was 
assembled on Sunday morning and marched to

26:33.408 --> 26:40.834
chapel. Was that still a practice when you were a 
student? Yes, I believe it was. I believe it was.

26:46.441 --> 26:49.243
And they had chapel in Guyon Hall, too. And so you 
had to get up and join your company? No, no, I

26:52.126 --> 26:52.867
didn't. I was excused from this. I went to Sunday 
school in church, but I did it on my own. Being a day

26:59.072 --> 27:02.355
student, I was not required to make that. I did have 
to make the military, too. In those days, the drill

27:05.678 --> 27:11.703
was on Tuesdays, and I did have to make all of those. 
Tuesday afternoons? Yes. That was your only day of

27:14.695 --> 27:15.876
drill? Yes, I believe that's right, yes. You said 
you went to Sunday school and church. Did you go in

27:20.801 --> 27:24.004
Guyon Hall or did you go to one of the churches off 
campus? No, I went to a local church. At

27:25.425 --> 27:43.723
the time that you were a student, what was the 
general attitude of the students towards the

27:25.425 --> 27:43.723
university administration or college 
administration?

27:45.965 --> 27:54.577
Having been on both sides, I hope you'll forgive me 
for adding a few extra words onto this. But I think

27:54.597 --> 28:15.887
in general, the students thought that if there was 
one thing that could be dispensed with in their

27:54.597 --> 28:15.887
college training, those days it was Texas A&M, so 
college or university training, it would have

27:54.597 --> 28:15.887
been the administration. But I don't think that's 
changed too much. I believe it's a little more

28:20.028 --> 28:27.176
acceptable today than it was then, but there's 
still a tendency for it to be that way.

28:34.004 --> 28:41.993
We know that a lot of students during the years have 
had part-time jobs, and you have were custodian,

28:42.412 --> 28:49.023
or indicated you were custodian of the Animal 
Husbandry Pavilion for your junior year, I

28:42.412 --> 28:49.023
believe. Yes. Did you have other jobs during the 
other years that you were a student? Yes, indeed.

28:53.691 --> 29:04.909
In fact, that year, the custodian was really an 
earning of the... of the room, the space where I

29:05.378 --> 29:08.111
lived. In addition to this, that same year I had to 
work because I I had practically no source of

29:14.356 --> 29:16.959
income. My parents, it was in the days when they 
just did not have money, and I was from a fairly

29:17.039 --> 29:24.067
large family. And so I worked for twenty-five 
cents an hour. They gave me work at the swine farm,

29:29.412 --> 29:39.283
and I worked there the first two years, and then I 
worked there during my junior year when I lived in

29:29.412 --> 29:39.283
the pavilion. And then I worked also in my senior 
year. I worked all four years at 25 cents an hour.

29:45.834 --> 29:48.819
Now, in addition to that, there was some earning. I 
collected specimens for the botany professor,

29:49.661 --> 29:53.948
Dr. Ball. He's long. He was head of the department. 
But I collected specimens. And then a part of a

30:02.255 --> 30:12.797
year, I worked part time in cleaning up the 
agricultural engineering shops after the

30:02.255 --> 30:12.797
classes.
