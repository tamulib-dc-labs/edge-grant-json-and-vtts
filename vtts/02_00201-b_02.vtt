00:04.537 --> 00:07.241
Your thoughts about A&M now? Yeah, I still think 
about the good old days. Yeah.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.400
All right. Let's see, didn't we have some pictures 
that we were going to, as a physical plant on the

00:19.420 --> 00:25.329
campus? Did anyone else come that you know of with 
him from A&M? Mr. Craitman, Dr. Craitman. Mr.

00:34.203 --> 00:36.025
Cradley was here. Mr. Cradley was his secretary 
through the years, long years. Finishing the new

00:42.573 --> 00:56.650
present home there, so we moved right into a brand 
new house, and it's very much, very much on a much

00:42.573 --> 00:56.650
smaller scale like the wonderful house at Marlin.

01:03.211 --> 01:18.264
house 50 some years and

01:03.211 --> 01:18.264
that

01:03.211 --> 01:18.264
house has been completely redone then. But it had 
been redone just the year 1925 when we moved up

01:19.585 --> 01:25.090
here. So it was really a nice house and it was built 
by the first person we moved. way back, of course.

01:39.767 --> 01:50.884
And now they've made it a big place, so they built a 
big room on the back of it that seats 60 people, so

01:39.767 --> 01:50.884
you have university affairs. But part of it is very 
much just those three. three houses, and I just had

01:58.848 --> 02:01.651
the two. So now you have that one. Yes, I see right 
where it is. Not very many people can say they've

02:07.859 --> 02:13.806
had three growing up childhood houses, and 
they've all been with Presley. You're right. And

02:16.770 --> 02:19.554
since I've been married, I've lived in three 
houses. They're my own houses now. So that's...

02:27.535 --> 02:32.544
Now, when you got to the University of Texas, what 
did your major, what was your academic major?

02:32.564 --> 02:33.646
History. Good. Good.

02:39.055 --> 02:42.000
Well, you took anthropology, didn't you? I 
understood that your father wanted

02:42.098 --> 02:49.710
anthropology. What caused him to be interested in 
that subject? I had no idea. I had no idea until I got

02:57.141 --> 03:03.090
to the university, and that's what I was enrolled 
in. My father was one that he just took over what I

03:03.110 --> 03:10.401
thought I should have, and that's what I took. And 
did he look at your grades carefully each

03:13.182 --> 03:17.569
semester? I don't know that he saw my grades, but 
they were, they got me through school, so I guess I

03:18.490 --> 03:28.385
don't know. And you said you don't remember how 
much a semester cost, the tuition or anything? No,

03:35.776 --> 03:38.380
I had nothing to do with paying for it, so I didn't.

03:41.633 --> 03:44.437
Yes, when Reveille came to visit you. Well, I had a 
little business to do with a broker, a young man,

03:45.579 --> 04:02.805
and he wanted me to come to his office, and I went to 
his office. And I was sitting across the desk from

04:02.825 --> 04:07.953
him, and he was talking to me. That's when he told 
me, Mike, do you understand me? And I looked down at

04:11.418 --> 04:16.746
a table right next to my chair. It was an ashtray. 
And I took a double look. It was at Texas A&M. And so I

04:25.580 --> 04:31.549
immediately said, I said, you have a Texas A&M 
ashtray. Did you go to Texas A&M? Well, we from then

04:34.216 --> 04:37.682
on, we were just good friends, you know. And we just 
talked more about it. And so that summer, the

04:40.929 --> 04:49.505
freshman that was taking care of Reveille was here 
in Oklahoma City. And I think they were having some

04:49.525 --> 04:53.492
kind of a layman meeting or something here. And so 
they had him here with Reveille. And so Ted asked

04:58.432 --> 05:02.136
him if he would come over. He brought him over here 
and took his picture with the beautiful collie.

05:11.546 --> 05:15.750
And then I got a framed copy of it. And that's what 
she's going to see. That was a real thrill for me.

05:23.658 --> 05:24.439
Very good. As

05:24.706 --> 05:50.823
I've

05:24.706 --> 05:50.823
heard it, somebody from A&M stole the owl. The owl, 
yeah. And a group of Rice students came up to get it.

05:55.935 --> 05:56.977
Do you remember any more? No. I'd forgotten all 
about the incident, but I do remember now. I had a

06:06.717 --> 06:07.258
picture of the owl. I saw the picture.
