00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.042
My name is Jorge Barrera.

00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:01.589
I'm a senior electrical engineering major from Eagle Pass, Texas.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.254
I was born in Piedras Negras, Coahuila.

00:01:05.777 --> 00:01:08.161
Probably remember the Texas Aggie class of 2001.

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:16.798
I was born in Piedras and I spent some time there because my dad's family is in Piedras.

00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:28.138
My mom's family is in Eagle Pass and when I was born we stayed a few months with my grandmother and then we came back to Eagle Pass.

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:34.669
My dad worked at that time at a furniture store and my mom at a downtown store.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.678
And I have another brother.

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:40.740
His name is Luis Armando Barrera.

00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.542
He's 15 or 16 right now.

00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:46.045
Wait, say his first name slower.

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:46.605
Luis.

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:47.326
Luis.

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:47.987
Armando.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:49.028
Armando.

00:01:49.048 --> 00:01:49.208
Yes.

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:53.632
And he was born in Piedras.

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:56.895
When I was born, my uncle was a doctor there.

00:01:57.336 --> 00:02:00.219
So he was kind of overlooking when I was born.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.762
And my aunt was a doctor there, so she overlooked my brother.

00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:10.096
And most of my childhood I would spend with my grandparents in Piedras.

00:02:10.717 --> 00:02:13.721
I spent so much time with my grandmother and my uncles.

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:20.111
Every single weekend that I had, every spring break, every summer, I would spend there with her.

00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:24.197
She was kind of like my mother.

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:29.780
So you grew up bilingual, truly bilingual?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.146
At first, for about the first six, seven years, I just spoke Spanish.

00:02:35.847 --> 00:02:43.917
And I kind of taught myself how to speak English, you know, watching a lot of TV and, you know, commercials and billboards and everything else.

00:02:43.937 --> 00:02:46.160
I just started learning English.

00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:49.965
And you're going to, when you start school, where do you, first grade?

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.029
Eagle Pass, on the American side.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.874
Right, you're living on the, in Eagle Pass all that time, okay.

00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:05.166
And by then, by that time I had kind of already learned a little bit, most of it, and then the rest I just learned throughout school.

00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:09.711
And I went to the school, this elementary, San Luis Elementary.

00:03:12.154 --> 00:03:12.635
It was pretty fun.

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:16.780
How big was Eagle Pass in those days when you were in elementary school?

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:19.157
15, 20,000 people.

00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:20.658
And Piedras was?

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:21.219
A lot bigger.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:22.560
Two or three times that?

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.341
I would say so.

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:24.702
It's a lot bigger city.

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:30.328
And did you travel much as a youngster beyond that area?

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:42.160
Actually, if we didn't go to, let's say, fishing or just some ranches that my uncles had, we'd go to see my uncles in Monterrey.

00:03:42.865 --> 00:04:09.835
Mexico and it'll it always be my dad and my grandma because we had just spent so much time together all three of us and so much with my grandmother and that's pretty much the only place that we'd ever go and we'd go to all the other parks and with my uncles and zoos and everything in multiple ways it was pretty fun i had a pretty good childhood as you look back uh who were the positive uh

00:04:10.456 --> 00:04:36.615
family that had a good positive effect on you and your learning and most of it was my parents of course because they gave me all the values and anything that i needed to learn but most of all my grandma like she helped me a lot and just because i spent so much time there in her house and my uncles as well by the time you're at high school how many in your senior class that you'll pass

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:41.521
Well, I graduated with 660-something, which was the biggest high school class.

00:04:42.362 --> 00:04:44.204
That was the record.

00:04:44.404 --> 00:04:45.665
Yeah.

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:50.551
Break it down, Hispanic, Anglo.

00:04:51.973 --> 00:05:00.382
Just to guess, I would say about 90% Hispanic, and the rest is Anglo.

00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:02.745
There's some people from Asia.

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.168
Well, there were.

00:05:06.228 --> 00:05:06.809
India.

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:12.096
I can't remember a single African-American family.

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:17.924
I think there's about two or three now, but when I was there, I just can't remember a single one.

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:20.768
When did you get the idea of going to college?

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.699
I've been wanting to go to college since probably fifth, sixth grade, and there's an interesting story of how I wanted to come here to A&M.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.261
When I was a fifth grader,

00:05:31.777 --> 00:05:36.484
I was a big Longhorn fan because it was the first team I had ever seen or the first school.

00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:40.710
So I would always do that hook'em thing and all that stuff.

00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:46.859
And then one year, I was in sixth grade by that time, I was at my grandmother's and it was Thanksgiving night.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.722
Yeah, it was Thursday night.

00:05:50.845 --> 00:05:54.754
And I was watching this game, because I knew the Longhorns were going to play that game.

00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:59.827
And out of the tunnel, I see this team coming out in this maroon helmet.

00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:01.430
And it's got these three letters.

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:07.926
It's got a T, an A, and an M. And it kind of surprised me to see that team.

00:06:07.906 --> 00:06:09.789
And I started looking more into that team.

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:15.460
So by seventh grade, I had become a big Aggie fan.

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:17.323
That was because I saw a helmet.

00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:22.612
And I don't know why, it just appealed to me that helmet did.

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:32.530
So that year, when I was in seventh grade, because over there it's first through sixth is elementary, seventh through ninth is junior high, and then 10th through 12th is high school.

00:06:33.775 --> 00:07:01.150
I was talking to this one friend of mine and I said hey let's go to A&M because he had sisters that had come here and I said playing I said jokingly I said hey let's become roommates now this is your eighth grade seventh grade seventh grade funny thing our senior year I talked to him again and I said are we going up there and he's like yeah and I said are we going to be roommates he said yes and we ended up being roommates for four years he graduated this past year oh god

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.456
and you went to Houston, and it was a pretty good, it was like a brotherhood more than anything.

00:07:06.278 --> 00:07:12.126
Did, nobody in my family had ever finished high school until I did, let alone go to college.

00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:15.111
Were there any college graduates ahead of you in your family?

00:07:15.271 --> 00:07:20.458
There was no college, well, on the side of my dad, they're all doctors, but they all went to Mexico.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.902
On this side, most of my

00:07:22.882 --> 00:07:47.860
mom's brothers and sisters on the American side and they finished high school but none of them went to college one went to a community college McLennan I think in Waco but he was there for a little while he played semi-professional baseball and then he became a minister so were there some teachers in high school that you now realize were also very important in your dreams and

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:52.194
I've been thinking about it for a while now, and I really can't think of any.

00:07:53.136 --> 00:07:59.288
Like I've been trying to see if anybody really pushed me or anything, but just...

00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:03.577
When you applied for admission to A&M, had you come to visit?

00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:04.819
Had you been here?

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:25.491
by them I've been here once before when I was a freshman but it was it was this thing that I was in the honor society and we had these two teachers I think one of them had been a student here that had this trip planned for us we came over and

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:30.353
We went to some class and I really don't remember much about it.

00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.842
I remember coming but I don't remember much about the school.

00:08:34.824 --> 00:08:38.092
Did it make a positive impression or much of any impression on you?

00:08:38.493 --> 00:08:39.375
No, not at all.

00:08:39.996 --> 00:08:41.801
I mean by that time I knew I wanted to come here.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:43.665
Okay.

00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:52.160
I guess I was thinking about some other stuff that I really didn't get to enjoy like I thought I would, like that visit, but I knew I still wanted to come here.

00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:58.391
Right, so you apply for admission and you're admitted and you enrolled in the fall of 1997.

00:09:01.797 --> 00:09:05.063
Were there any restrictions on your enrollment or anything?

00:09:05.853 --> 00:09:12.122
Not on my enrollment, but ever since I wanted to come here I knew I wanted to become an electrical engineering major.

00:09:12.963 --> 00:09:20.114
That semester I came in and I had to take this test and I was put in pre-engineering, general studies pre-engineering.

00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:24.580
So I had to kind of work my way up to the engineering department.

00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:30.088
I remember the first semester I

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:34.354
I took this classes and I remember getting a D in one of my classes.

00:09:35.357 --> 00:09:38.484
And I started worrying about what if I didn't get accepted into it.

00:09:38.965 --> 00:09:41.451
But after that all my grades started going up, up, up.

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:47.545
I guess they saw that I was improving, so they allowed me to become an electrical engineer.

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:51.013
When you came to enroll, did you go to fish camp?

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:51.374
No.

00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:54.379
And there's another interesting story.

00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:58.687
When I first came up was for orientation.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.937
And it was funny because I came up with that guy, my friend, that we were going to become roommates.

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:09.087
His sister dropped us off in one of the gas stations because we were going to stay with a friend, this guy that I knew.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:13.334
So we were there at the gas station for about 30 minutes not knowing where we were or anything.

00:10:13.354 --> 00:10:15.338
He knew a little bit because two of his sisters had been here.

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:21.008
So he picked us up and then he would drop us off in school and just leave because he had other stuff to do.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.395
And this campus was so big when I first came in that I had no idea where I was.

00:10:26.557 --> 00:10:28.961
And some friends were here too on orientation.

00:10:29.683 --> 00:10:34.551
And one of the things that happened was we all got separated to go into our college meetings.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.931
And somehow I was walking around not knowing where I was.

00:10:36.951 --> 00:10:39.055
I don't know how I ended up in G. Raleigh White.

00:10:39.776 --> 00:10:43.342
I remember getting out of that building, looking around, and I saw all my friends walking together.

00:10:43.742 --> 00:10:44.524
I was like, oh, there they are.

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:46.667
So we got back together.

00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:48.911
But I have to say, this was a really big campus.

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:55.662
And my planning when I was going to come, I said, I'm going to look at the map and go around streets so I can know where I'm going.

00:10:56.343 --> 00:11:00.049
But once I got here, I was like, I'm just going to walk across and see where I end up.

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:00.570
All right.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.636
When you came to Enroll in the fall of 97, how did you get here?

00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:07.258
Who brought you?

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:11.904
And what all of the, what kind of, what was the stuff that you brought with you?

00:11:11.924 --> 00:11:12.144
All right.

00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:15.228
That's a good story.

00:11:15.248 --> 00:11:17.071
I came with my roommate because he had his truck.

00:11:18.372 --> 00:11:20.535
And that was funny because that was a truck that

00:11:21.275 --> 00:11:22.196
We need so much gas.

00:11:22.937 --> 00:11:23.277
Pickup?

00:11:23.477 --> 00:11:24.278
Yeah, pickup truck.

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:26.159
I think it was a Chevy.

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:36.569
And since I was living in Walton at the time, not in air condition, I remember most of the stuff we had were fans, clothes, and just a lot of stuff.

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:40.112
Because as a freshman, you bring in a lot of stuff, not knowing what you really need or anything like that.

00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:44.476
And the first thing I remember, we parked, and we were taking down the fans.

00:11:45.597 --> 00:11:49.801
And somebody from Schumacher yells, what do you guys need fans for?

00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:50.742
And we said.

00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:53.697
because we were living in Walton, they started laughing at us.

00:11:54.438 --> 00:11:55.900
So I was like, hmm, that's pretty interesting.

00:11:56.461 --> 00:12:01.548
I put my stuff up, and then, and this is one of the most vivid things I remember.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:13.686
I'm walking down and going outside, and I meet this guy who's taking couches outside, introduces himself, he says, hey, they call me Rocky, and he's got a black eye.

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:15.890
And I was like, why do they call you Rocky?

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.332
He says, I get in a lot of fights.

00:12:18.634 --> 00:12:20.897
And I started laughing, and he's like, and this is,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.639
And this started a lot of the stuff, because you really know you're at the right place, he says.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.363
Come and meet the guys outside.

00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:29.506
So we go.

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:30.147
We turn around.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.350
We turn the corner.

00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:35.420
And outside are all these guys, a lot of them freshmen, just getting to know each other.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.944
And he says, introduce yourself.

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:37.826
Go meet people around here.

00:12:38.648 --> 00:12:40.793
So I sit down, and I start talking to a bunch of people.

00:12:41.903 --> 00:12:46.791
I start the Aggie Network right there and then, and I think it's really fun.

00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:57.890
Now one of the things that I particularly want to capture in this are your feelings regarding how you were treated as a Hispanic.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:03.760
Did that first day, did anybody give you any plus or minus?

00:13:04.162 --> 00:13:05.383
because of your background?

00:13:06.004 --> 00:13:06.525
Not really.

00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:20.279
I could have, I could kind of see it because at one point they're all, a big thing with Walton is they start giving out nicknames to the freshmen and I remember one of them they couldn't say his name was Adolfo and they couldn't say Adolfo they just say Adolf.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:29.629
So his nickname became Hitler and but I sat down and I mean you're just a freshman you really don't know what's going on and

00:13:29.997 --> 00:13:54.874
there's upperclassmen they think they know a lot more than you do and I mean they do know a lot more but I didn't really I saw that hey this is a freshman but I didn't see hey this is an Hispanic guy did you get a nickname no they had enough they had a hard time enough saying Jorge for a while so they just said I will just leave it with that oh now you and your roommate were there other Hispanics in the dorm at that point at that point yes

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:22.060
and I remember one of them who was a sophomore and he had become kind of a big person there because in Walton back then you were a bonfire, you were accepted and his name was Cito and I remember he was a pretty good guy and the other freshmen were like I said Adolfo and there's some other ones that hanged out with them and that's one of the most important things once you're hanging out with them you're accepted I mean it doesn't matter what happens or anything like that

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:45.786
so you move in describe uh that fall describe your room what did you all have there yeah I went in and there was nothing there was just two beds bunk beds my roommate that summer had been in Kingsville in a room and he's he looked at he's like I hate this place already and I was like wow

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:49.428
And I looked around and I was like, this is where I'm going to be for the next, what, four years or so?

00:14:49.468 --> 00:14:53.633
And I said, wow, it's kind of just plain, really plain.

00:14:53.673 --> 00:14:55.634
And it was really hot.

00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:58.778
But after a while, I mean, you get so used to it.

00:14:59.538 --> 00:15:12.851
And one of the, I remember that night was very funny because we were just, we were just taking a, or not a nap, just resting because we had to move all our stuff up.

00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:14.473
And back then, those days,

00:15:15.888 --> 00:15:17.030
So much storm rivalry.

00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:18.892
And next door was a Schumacher.

00:15:20.174 --> 00:15:20.895
Can I say bad words here?

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.723
I remember we were looking outside.

00:15:25.803 --> 00:15:28.126
We were next to the window because we only had one window.

00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:32.833
And I hear the guys from next door say, hey, Walton, fuck you.

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:37.463
And I got up and I was like, wow, there must be something going on.

00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:43.051
So I went across the room to where the other guys, one was a sophomore and the other one was a freshman too.

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:46.455
But there was another sophomore in there and I said, hey, those guys are yelling at us.

00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:47.537
Does that mean something?

00:15:47.577 --> 00:15:50.921
And I was really excited and they just looked at me and they were like, oh, okay.

00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:52.103
Because they knew what was going on.

00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:54.226
I mean, they knew they'd do that every single night.

00:15:56.529 --> 00:15:57.650
So I was like, okay.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.196
So I went back to my room and unpacked some more.

00:16:02.935 --> 00:16:07.883
All right, now in that room, when you all got it all set up, did you, you didn't have a computer?

00:16:08.244 --> 00:16:08.404
No.

00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:09.586
I didn't have a computer.

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:10.868
Did you have a television?

00:16:11.068 --> 00:16:13.813
I decided that semester not to bring a television because I wanted to study.

00:16:14.514 --> 00:16:21.605
And I, because I know myself, and I know that once I started watching television, it would distract me, and I said, no television.

00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:23.088
You brought a radio.

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.910
And that was about it.

00:16:27.595 --> 00:16:28.977
How much clothing did you bring?

00:16:29.513 --> 00:16:30.517
More than enough.

00:16:30.537 --> 00:16:31.320
More than enough?

00:16:32.163 --> 00:16:32.384
Yeah.

00:16:32.605 --> 00:16:34.151
You brought, did you bring suits?

00:16:34.753 --> 00:16:40.114
No, just the usual like shirts and some nice stuff to, if I did go out.

00:16:40.938 --> 00:16:44.984
Because one of my biggest hobbies or one thing that I really like to do is go out and meet people.

00:16:45.525 --> 00:16:46.126
It's like a must.

00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:47.948
Like every day I must meet at least one person.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:54.878
Because I don't believe if you're in a college like this, this big, first of all, this friendly, not to meet people.

00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:55.659
Good idea.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.901
You meet people every single day.

00:16:57.963 --> 00:17:01.107
Now how did you get enrolled in your classes that fall?

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:03.170
Was that done by mail?

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:03.711
Orientation.

00:17:03.931 --> 00:17:04.873
Orientation, okay.

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:09.139
They were just there and they started picking out classes, like for freshmen, like English.

00:17:10.165 --> 00:17:11.588
And engineering was your goal?

00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:11.888
Yes.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:19.563
And I was already being in engineering because I had a pre-calculus and I had engineering 189 and engineering, I don't remember what else.

00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:23.871
And in your high school class, you were in what quart, what?

00:17:24.032 --> 00:17:26.957
I was number five out of 600 and 70 or something.

00:17:27.058 --> 00:17:29.021
So you had good, you had good grade, good scores.

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:29.743
Yeah, I had above 100.

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:31.586
I had a 101 point something.

00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:32.528
Great, great.

00:17:32.508 --> 00:17:35.215
And how many hours?

00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:36.779
Do you remember how many hours that first fall?

00:17:37.059 --> 00:17:37.320
Twelve.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:37.841
Twelve.

00:17:38.964 --> 00:17:43.295
And in order to get out of pre-engineering, what did you need to do?

00:17:43.515 --> 00:17:44.678
I needed to get a

00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:51.976
I think a 2.7 overall, and started taking those engineering courses.

00:17:52.597 --> 00:18:07.822
I remember I got to a 2.5 something, but I went from a 2.1 my first semester, and the second semester I got a 2.8 and then a 3.0 and a 3.3, and they finally admitted me into engineering.

00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:11.408
During that first semester,

00:18:11.962 --> 00:18:15.187
Describe a typical class day.

00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:16.549
What time did you get up?

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.493
What did you do at what time?

00:18:18.953 --> 00:18:21.818
I think I had an 8 o'clock, so I woke up at 7 most of the time.

00:18:22.739 --> 00:18:24.723
And I'd go to class, and some of those classes were really big.

00:18:25.023 --> 00:18:26.445
Did you eat breakfast before you went?

00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:33.336
That actually is, that semester I decided to get 21 meals, which was three meals a day.

00:18:34.338 --> 00:18:36.782
So I'd get up, I'd go to breakfast.

00:18:36.802 --> 00:18:37.683
And in Sevesa?

00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:38.104
In Sevesa.

00:18:39.653 --> 00:18:51.331
go to breakfast in Sabeasa, go to classes, go to lunch in Sabeasa, go to classes or whatever I had to do, come back and go to dinner with Walton in Sabeasa.

00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:53.355
And so you all ate as a group at supper?

00:18:53.895 --> 00:18:54.056
Yeah.

00:18:54.076 --> 00:18:55.378
Pretty good.

00:18:55.418 --> 00:18:55.959
That was a lot of fun.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.486
And where did you study during the day?

00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:05.053
What did you do when you didn't have anything scheduled, if you had say a couple hours?

00:19:06.248 --> 00:19:07.409
Did you do it in your room?

00:19:07.449 --> 00:19:11.594
I tried to do a lot in my room and I think I did some here at Evans.

00:19:14.978 --> 00:19:17.101
I remember the first two years I studied a lot here.

00:19:18.362 --> 00:19:23.228
And did you have anybody you turned to for advice?

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:27.193
There were these two guys that were sophomores.

00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:31.669
So anytime we needed something, we kind of turned to them or I turned to my roommate.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.895
He wasn't, he was still a freshman like I was, but those two guys had been here at least a year.

00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:44.384
Once I started to know more people around the hall, around Walton, I would turn to them and say, hey, this and that, and they were pretty good at it.

00:19:47.007 --> 00:19:50.852
If you wanted to take a nap,

00:19:51.507 --> 00:19:52.568
Did you do that in your room?

00:19:52.828 --> 00:19:53.790
Yeah, in my room, definitely.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.674
Could you sleep in the afternoons without somebody bothering you?

00:19:57.934 --> 00:19:58.835
Yeah.

00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:00.177
It was kind of hot.

00:20:00.437 --> 00:20:01.178
That was the only thing.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.664
Actually, if it was in the room, we did it in the lounge, because that was the only place that had air conditioner.

00:20:07.385 --> 00:20:11.590
So we'd just go in there, lie down for a few minutes, watch TV, because we didn't have a TV that first semester.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.813
So not only did we have air conditioning, we had TV there.

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:16.936
So we spent some time there, too.

00:20:17.196 --> 00:20:20.940
And then normally at night, you'd study till what time?

00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:48.396
that first year I would say eleven twelve because it was we were trying to adapt alright and looking back now how well prepared did Eagle Pass High School not at all I wasn't prepared when I came in what what looking back on it what did you need more of more math definitely more math more physics and just more study skills when I got here

00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:51.341
It was more like a, well, I was so high up there.

00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:52.343
I know I can do it here.

00:20:52.904 --> 00:20:54.567
When you get here, it's a reality.

00:20:54.927 --> 00:20:55.969
You're not as smart as you thought.

00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:58.273
It's not Eagle Pass where everybody's just below you.

00:20:58.914 --> 00:20:59.756
Now you're at the average.

00:20:59.896 --> 00:21:00.597
You have to work.

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:04.083
And when I got here, I learned that the hard way.

00:21:04.624 --> 00:21:05.806
Did you go to class regularly?

00:21:05.906 --> 00:21:06.407
Yeah.

00:21:06.427 --> 00:21:07.389
I never skipped or anything.

00:21:08.571 --> 00:21:12.898
And as far as you can recall, about how much did that first year cost?

00:21:15.393 --> 00:21:16.575
I would say about three grand.

00:21:16.895 --> 00:21:17.617
Did your family?

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:23.626
I had grants and loans and whatever my family could help me out with.

00:21:24.568 --> 00:21:26.090
So you didn't have to work?

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.193
No, I didn't have to work.

00:21:29.796 --> 00:21:36.366
Then as football season began, describe a freshman going to his first Aggie football games.

00:21:36.507 --> 00:21:39.291
Well, the first thing I actually did was I'll unite.

00:21:39.997 --> 00:21:45.626
when all the halls get together as a hall and they lock arms and people are trying to take your flag.

00:21:46.267 --> 00:21:48.610
That to me was amazing because it was something that I'd never seen.

00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:51.535
People were trying to get our flags and we really got rowdy.

00:21:52.296 --> 00:21:55.201
At those times, things were really rowdy.

00:21:56.182 --> 00:22:03.253
I mean, there were so many fights and stuff would just go on and you'd get there and the grogels that they had and it was just, everything was just new to me.

00:22:03.233 --> 00:22:08.900
So we all went together as a group, and we did so much stuff, and that's when we started bonding, what we'd call our fish buddies.

00:22:11.303 --> 00:22:16.329
So I started to get to know a lot of the guys there, and it was fun.

00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:18.432
I mean, I was sweating, and it was just so much fun.

00:22:19.133 --> 00:22:23.919
And once football started coming around, of course, it was Midnight Yale practice first, and that was a lot of fun.

00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:25.140
That was something really new.

00:22:26.639 --> 00:22:33.068
that was real pride and that was real school spirit, not the, you know, cheerleading and all that stuff.

00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:35.511
To me, that's very useless.

00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:39.957
And then when you went to the game, did you and a bunch of your dormitory buddies go together?

00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:47.648
Yeah, we had, we went together as a whole because we pulled together and it was just a great experience.

00:22:48.349 --> 00:22:49.991
It's just the game itself, everybody standing up.

00:22:50.712 --> 00:22:55.819
I remember, because I wore boots all the time, I remember taking boots

00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:57.501
And by the end of the day, my feet were hurting.

00:22:58.062 --> 00:23:00.124
And I remember saying, never again will I bring boots.

00:23:00.184 --> 00:23:01.406
I mean, I still wore them.

00:23:01.426 --> 00:23:05.670
But after that day out, I said, until a football game that you have to stand up all the time.

00:23:05.711 --> 00:23:06.972
I'm going to bring something more comfortable.

00:23:07.573 --> 00:23:07.873
All right.

00:23:07.893 --> 00:23:11.637
And that first fall, what did you and your buddies do on a Saturday night after the game?

00:23:15.962 --> 00:23:18.425
We'd either go to either dorm parties or.

00:23:18.986 --> 00:23:19.667
Where would that be?

00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:21.469
Different houses.

00:23:21.569 --> 00:23:24.092
And just across the street, there was this one place.

00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:25.013
I can't remember the name of it.

00:23:25.921 --> 00:23:28.423
But I remember we would follow them there, and we'd go to that.

00:23:28.443 --> 00:23:29.044
Off campus?

00:23:29.144 --> 00:23:29.304
Yeah.

00:23:31.006 --> 00:23:34.590
And we would just be there hanging out with friends that were here.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.634
We had some girlfriends that had come over here, and we'd just hang out together.

00:23:39.675 --> 00:23:43.659
Kind of got to know everybody, and it was just, I can't really don't, that's a good question.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.242
All right, then on Sunday, what time did you wake up?

00:23:47.282 --> 00:23:52.307
For our football weekend, what time would a freshman wake up on Sunday?

00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:55.270
I've always woke up kind of early.

00:23:55.992 --> 00:24:03.622
So I would wake up to watch either cartoons or just to wake up or study or it's been so long.

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:05.525
Now did you go to church?

00:24:06.005 --> 00:24:06.326
Not here.

00:24:06.666 --> 00:24:07.047
Not here.

00:24:07.567 --> 00:24:07.808
All right.

00:24:07.908 --> 00:24:11.633
Then Sunday afternoon, study or goof off?

00:24:11.933 --> 00:24:14.116
Study and a lot of goofing off too.

00:24:14.156 --> 00:24:17.721
It was one of those days that you just want to be in your room and just.

00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:20.164
And you didn't go to any of the out of town football games?

00:24:20.264 --> 00:24:20.424
No.

00:24:20.785 --> 00:24:21.025
All right.

00:24:21.205 --> 00:24:25.611
Then did you go home that fall before Thanksgiving?

00:24:28.628 --> 00:24:30.110
I would say I went at least home twice.

00:24:31.973 --> 00:24:33.975
I don't really remember, but I think I did go home twice.

00:24:33.995 --> 00:24:37.560
And you all, how long a drive is it to Eagle Pass?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.141
Five and a half.

00:24:39.042 --> 00:24:40.765
And you'd go in that pickup truck?

00:24:40.785 --> 00:24:40.965
Yeah.

00:24:41.365 --> 00:24:43.648
Did you take anybody else with you or just the two?

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:45.731
It'd be most of us, just the two of us.

00:24:46.212 --> 00:24:47.113
Mostly just the two of us.

00:24:48.074 --> 00:24:49.637
Once in a while we would take an extra person.

00:24:49.717 --> 00:24:51.039
Leave Friday what time?

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.100
Noon?

00:24:53.021 --> 00:24:53.662
Noon one.

00:24:54.663 --> 00:24:55.885
And get back Sunday?

00:24:56.386 --> 00:24:58.028
Like at five, six.

00:24:59.628 --> 00:25:02.614
I try to leave as soon as possible in traffic and all that stuff.

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:09.969
The, and you learned about the campus from dormitory friends.

00:25:10.189 --> 00:25:11.331
A lot of it I learned from that.

00:25:11.592 --> 00:25:17.704
That's why, in my experience, I don't really think fish camp is that big of a deal.

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:27.491
It's, the way I see it now, I think Fish Camp has lost a lot of its true meaning or what it really is made for.

00:25:28.192 --> 00:25:43.236
I see a lot of these counselors going around campus, as we speak right now, doing all these goofy things, dressing up, that to me it seems more they're doing it for themselves and for a social purpose than what it was intended to be, was to bring in those freshmen and show them what it is A&M is all about.

00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:48.007
How did you and your buddies learn about A&M traditions and all that?

00:25:48.308 --> 00:25:49.351
Walton Hall.

00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:49.572
Oh, okay.

00:25:49.592 --> 00:25:50.615
It was all Walton.

00:25:50.635 --> 00:25:50.896
Okay.

00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:54.267
Did, let's see, did Walton have a nickname?

00:25:54.348 --> 00:25:55.311
Were you all the Walton?

00:25:55.572 --> 00:25:55.993
Loads.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:57.941
Loads?

00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:02.611
L-O-A-D-S, because during bonfire, Walton was the one that would load the trees into them.

00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:03.332
Oh, okay.

00:26:03.352 --> 00:26:08.282
So that became a big, they're the warriors, but they're no more as loads.

00:26:09.184 --> 00:26:13.111
The, and you didn't call your roommate your fish old lady.

00:26:13.232 --> 00:26:13.953
No.

00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:18.943
Did y'all use, in the dining hall, did y'all use Aggie slang for the food?

00:26:19.868 --> 00:26:22.572
Not so much for the food, but a lot of the stuff that we did in there.

00:26:23.152 --> 00:26:24.414
Such as?

00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:34.528
For example, not so much words, but when Walton went in there during dinner, all the tables were, per se, horizontal.

00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:36.611
Ours was the only one that was vertical.

00:26:37.692 --> 00:26:39.234
And everybody knew that was Walton's table.

00:26:39.995 --> 00:26:41.477
So we sat there, we did all these things.

00:26:42.018 --> 00:26:44.802
We had some piece of balls, which are a bunch of napkins.

00:26:44.822 --> 00:26:47.125
You put them together like a little ball and you start throwing them around.

00:26:47.442 --> 00:26:49.309
And we'd yell at people.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.554
We'd get on the tables.

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:54.870
During Friday, when there were home games, we would get up there and do Viking Yell.

00:26:55.272 --> 00:26:57.555
which is when everybody starts eating without utensils or anything.

00:26:57.575 --> 00:26:58.677
It's just very messy.

00:26:59.197 --> 00:26:59.878
Then we have a yell.

00:27:00.499 --> 00:27:02.702
All the halls would get on top of the tables and start yelling.

00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:06.347
And of course, we did so much groating back then.

00:27:07.508 --> 00:27:12.495
For people that don't know what groating is, it was just wrestling in the mud or wrestling in the dirt, just wrestling anywhere.

00:27:13.116 --> 00:27:16.600
And you would see so many people running around campus groating each other.

00:27:17.081 --> 00:27:24.030
You had what you call groat clothes, your groats, which was the same clothes you would wear throughout bonfire and everything like that.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.953
You would get them dirty and that's how you left them.

00:27:26.233 --> 00:27:27.095
You wore them like that.

00:27:27.716 --> 00:27:30.980
They'd stink all the time and they were dirty all the time, muddy.

00:27:32.362 --> 00:27:33.644
But that's what people were used to.

00:27:33.744 --> 00:27:42.197
I would wake up on Saturday mornings, look outside the window and I would see people running all over campus, groaning already, like it had already started.

00:27:42.758 --> 00:27:45.903
So I would go downstairs and I'd see the girls grow the guys and so on and so forth.

00:27:46.563 --> 00:27:47.605
It was just so much fun.

00:27:48.057 --> 00:27:54.364
Was there, as you think about the meaning of the word hazing, was there any hazing of freshman, your freshman year?

00:27:55.305 --> 00:27:56.066
There probably was.

00:27:56.186 --> 00:27:58.109
It was just very different.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.432
Nobody ever paddled anybody, did they?

00:28:01.452 --> 00:28:02.113
I never saw that.

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:04.656
And nobody forced you all to drink anything?

00:28:04.736 --> 00:28:04.916
No.

00:28:05.697 --> 00:28:10.603
There was one thing that was called Freshman, I can't remember the name.

00:28:11.824 --> 00:28:15.128
In Sabeasa they had this plate and they put in all this food together.

00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:18.120
And it's just the tradition that the freshmen have to eat a little bit of it.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.740
And it was just fun.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.421
It was just funny.

00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:21.063
I never saw that as hazing.

00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:26.047
And by and large, were the sophomore juniors and seniors helpful to you all?

00:28:26.228 --> 00:28:27.149
Yeah, they were very nice.

00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:31.913
A lot of, well, just like everything else, there were some that were extremely nice, some that just didn't care.

00:28:32.734 --> 00:28:38.580
But I think about it now, and throughout the years, there's always been those people that have been really helpful.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:44.085
And the other day, I was walking around, and I thought to myself that I should make a list of all those people that I've met.

00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:48.019
Because the older you get, the more people start leaving, coming and leaving.

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:49.300
Sure, sure.

00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:59.112
And as you went to class, as you look back on it, did you have good teachers that first semester?

00:28:59.172 --> 00:29:00.074
Did you have some people?

00:29:00.094 --> 00:29:01.515
There was one that I really didn't like.

00:29:01.836 --> 00:29:02.196
Did not?

00:29:02.216 --> 00:29:03.358
He was my English teacher.

00:29:03.598 --> 00:29:04.159
What was wrong?

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.721
He just gave me D's.

00:29:06.562 --> 00:29:08.084
Well, but did you deserve a D?

00:29:08.804 --> 00:29:10.146
Looking at it now, probably yes.

00:29:11.047 --> 00:29:12.469
But I really didn't like him at all.

00:29:13.782 --> 00:29:16.064
Did he not encourage you?

00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:19.808
What didn't you like about him?

00:29:19.828 --> 00:29:23.491
I guess it was just the fact that he gave me that D. Like, I just didn't like him, period.

00:29:24.352 --> 00:29:27.836
Like, I never thought about anything, but I just didn't like the guy for some reason.

00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:30.158
What about on the positive side?

00:29:30.318 --> 00:29:32.580
Were they, did you like, were the others good teachers?

00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:35.904
Yeah, I realized that some of them really wanted to help you.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:42.490
They weren't, because every year, or every time you hear people say, in college it's just a number, or

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.555
How big were your freshman sections?

00:29:46.575 --> 00:29:47.176
It would depend.

00:29:47.236 --> 00:29:50.762
If it was like a 105 class, we had at least 50 people.

00:29:51.283 --> 00:29:53.226
That English class had like 20 or 30.

00:29:54.348 --> 00:29:56.191
So it would all depend.

00:29:56.212 --> 00:29:59.277
Some of them, like the chemistry and physics, they were just so huge.

00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:02.402
Sort of like the weed out classes.

00:30:03.293 --> 00:30:28.997
as far as you know except for that english uh did you normally get the grade you deserved yeah i would say so some of them was just surprising because like i said i had in high school i was all a's and i get here and i get some b's c's and i was just surprised how much i was going to have to study now you all didn't have a quick old quiz file did you in walton

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.001
I don't remember it.

00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:33.723
I think they did, but I don't remember it.

00:30:35.325 --> 00:30:36.066
Because they do now.

00:30:36.326 --> 00:30:40.090
And I remember we've had a bunch of tests and quizzes and stuff like that there.

00:30:41.251 --> 00:30:44.074
Do you remember going to your first Silver Taps?

00:30:45.196 --> 00:30:45.416
Yes.

00:30:46.417 --> 00:30:47.258
What was your impression?

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:53.184
I remember, because in Walton we talk about traditions all the time.

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:56.248
And we really encourage people to come out and join it.

00:30:56.388 --> 00:30:58.410
And they would come around.

00:30:58.627 --> 00:31:00.469
with kind of what you would call a wake-up.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.313
They'd come and knock on your door and say, hey, come out to Silvertaps with us.

00:31:05.755 --> 00:31:07.237
And I remember I was like, Silvertaps, what's that?

00:31:07.257 --> 00:31:09.199
And they just explained what it was, and I was like, oh, wow.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.264
And I remember going out there and seeing all those Aggies out there, and I was like, this is really nice.

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:19.190
I didn't think there was another school that could match us or be like us.

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:20.652
And that first Silvertaps.
