00:16.113 --> 00:20.317
You know, it's kind of interesting. I've learned 
probably a little bit more about that since he just

00:20.777 --> 00:23.759
recently died. But like everybody else, I mean, 
you know, what could you say? They got a name that's

00:30.125 --> 00:32.827
called Tricky Dick. And, you know,

00:32.847 --> 00:40.273
his calling card was I am not a crook. I mean, that 
basically sums up my opinion of him. You know, not

00:44.677 --> 00:46.018
to say he's not a crook,

01:16.188 --> 01:36.458
I would say not, only because my impression of A&M 
is that, you know, it's one thing to have

01:16.188 --> 01:36.458
traditions, and it's one thing to honor

01:16.188 --> 01:36.458
those traditions, but it's another thing to

02:00.029 --> 02:05.075
that we really, you know, we don't. To me, it's 
overshadowed. That's the superficial end of it. I

02:10.781 --> 02:12.944
think some people really do help you because 
you're Aggies. But I still think that there is no

02:13.865 --> 02:17.990
fundamental change underneath that. I still 
think that there's even in A&M, there's racism.

02:22.195 --> 02:24.297
And I would still say racism is pretty strong. You 
know, when I came here, I didn't do myself.

02:42.368 --> 02:44.915
You know, I don't even know what that means. But I 
guess what it really means, and I felt like I was

02:44.935 --> 02:50.130
black first, you know, and Aggie second. But 
primarily because the white power structure is

02:50.190 --> 02:53.840
not going to let you forget that you're black 
first. You know, you can be Aggie all you want to,

02:54.642 --> 02:56.648
but you do

03:10.297 --> 03:15.325
I spent about 12 months going to graduate school 
here. I picked up a master's in architecture and

03:15.345 --> 03:20.312
graduated in August of 74. I went to work for an 
architecture firm briefly in Houston and then I

03:21.434 --> 03:31.009
went to work for a telephone company as a project 
architect for 10. I basically did that. For about

03:35.457 --> 03:43.644
19 years, one of these fortunate people stayed 
with the same company for a long period of time. And

03:43.664 --> 03:52.633
during that time, first job was in St. Louis, then 
moved on to San Antonio, Dallas, and then Houston.

03:52.713 --> 03:55.815
I was in Houston about eight years before. Small 
company now, parted ways. So that sort of softened

03:58.938 --> 04:03.102
up real quick, but that's kind of what

04:07.233 --> 04:09.697
Basically, looking for a job. Basically, you 
know, through some of the, I think, people around

04:10.959 --> 04:22.877
here that are trying to be visionary about some 
things in terms of increasing diversity. I mean,

04:23.799 --> 04:25.922
you know, let's be honest with you. Right now, for 
the past three years, I've been a member of the

04:27.044 --> 04:32.533
president's advisory. I should say the 
president's former student. had gotten to know a

04:37.473 --> 04:39.516
lot of the university people. And so when I had to 
leave the phone company, I basically called the

04:39.556 --> 04:45.705
chancellor, who used to be the president. And 
because of the work I'd done for the university,

04:46.446 --> 04:53.756
not doubt about it, get on one position and wind up 
taking it. So on that Sunday, it actually does

04:55.038 --> 04:57.722
work. But unfortunately, the fact that it does 
work in that situation, he's doing something

04:57.742 --> 05:03.430
really different from what other people

05:08.911 --> 05:14.162
A lot of people, they sort of talk the talk, but you 
don't see it over by themselves.

05:42.998 --> 05:47.848
black people here. But a lot of it is now in 
preconceived notions, preconceived ideas. A lot

05:54.140 --> 05:59.050
of it is in the networking.

06:09.307 --> 06:10.333
don't feel comfortable with. And if these people 
are Aggies or what have you, and you still don't

06:11.077 --> 06:17.190
feel comfortable with them because of color or 
what have you,

06:37.066 --> 06:44.758
way to go because it has not included enough people 
at the table to get the proper type of view. It's

06:44.778 --> 06:53.893
doing a lot of things, but unfortunately, there's 
some things, fundamental things that have to

06:44.778 --> 06:53.893
change at the top before the student side changes.

07:05.180 --> 07:20.402
It's a move nowadays to go to historically black 
universities and a lot of students because they

07:05.180 --> 07:20.402
are dealing with white teachers and they're in 
mixed settings and having to deal with all these

07:05.180 --> 07:20.402
racial type things even now in the 90s. A lot of more 
black students are saying, hey, I don't even want

07:20.662 --> 07:25.088
to deal with that. I want to go somewhere where 
that's not an issue. And so that's why...

07:35.369 --> 07:36.991
I'm sick of it. You know, I don't want to deal with 
it. And so they go somewhere else and they figure

07:39.854 --> 07:46.562
what when they get out and get a job they'll be 
sending out. It's a little different for me, you

07:47.382 --> 07:49.104
see. I may have felt the same way if I had been in a 
great situation to start with. You know, the

07:54.150 --> 07:57.494
future for Black Power. Well, you know, getting 
back to Black Power, you know, Black Power is a

07:59.356 --> 08:04.802
certain amount of... solidarity. Black Power is 
spending a lot of your own money back in the black

08:08.741 --> 08:15.130
community. I'm somewhat pessimistic about that 
because I think people still, unfortunately,

08:15.671 --> 08:23.082
have to have their conscience raised. 
Unfortunately, we're still in a situation where

08:23.843 --> 08:33.237
materialism, in a certain way, you know, we want to 
look good, smell good, and all these other kind of

08:23.843 --> 08:33.237
things, you know.

08:37.823 --> 08:44.905
I'm optimistic in the sense that more and more 
people are doing more and more things and sort of

08:37.823 --> 08:44.905
getting it together. But until in this particular 
country, Whites realize that by leaving black

08:50.598 --> 09:01.280
people on the bottom is actually endangering 
their position in society. They're not going to

09:01.300 --> 09:09.656
want to change it until they realize by not 
sharing, you know, by not sharing what's theirs.

09:09.676 --> 09:09.957
Exactly.

09:19.994 --> 09:24.874
I'd like not to have to deal with it going into the 
year 2000, but I'm afraid we are.

09:46.657 --> 10:02.463
And basically,

09:46.657 --> 10:02.463
we have a lot of projects for the various campuses, 
construction, construction projects for the

09:46.657 --> 10:02.463
various campuses and entities. And I'm in what's 
called the planning aspect of it.

10:40.589 --> 10:59.728
tankers for the equine reproduction center, 
trying to wait until we get some things worked out

10:40.589 --> 10:59.728
on a project called the Coastal Oil Spill 
Simulation System, in which we're in conjunction

10:40.589 --> 10:59.728
with Anacorpis Christi, putting

11:31.028 --> 11:41.211
No, just that, you know, it really needs to wake up 
and broaden its perspective. It needs to do some

11:41.411 --> 11:47.485
outside-the-box thinking, so to speak.

11:59.176 --> 12:04.123
traditions of helping people, of being together, 
and all those kind of things are good. But

12:05.065 --> 12:12.576
traditions where it's business as usual and all 
that is really not helping. And I don't think it's

12:12.596 --> 12:16.822
helping situations where universities just do 
business as usual. I think that I'm looking

12:17.323 --> 12:22.050
forward to Bowen coming in. I think Dr. Bowen will 
be

12:29.821 --> 12:37.975
I think we have people in the personification of 
Dr. Moses that are, I think, visionary in trying

13:01.681 --> 13:03.324
don't understand. You know, they don't, they're, 
you know, it's kind of like, I've told people

13:03.344 --> 13:12.079
before, it's kind of like being a Christian. You 
know, as a Christian, you're not only just called

13:12.099 --> 13:22.197
to associate only with Christians and go to church 
and have a good time and, you know, church suppers

13:12.099 --> 13:22.197
and Bible studies and all that. Just enjoy that. 
You know, you're called to go beyond that.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.497
Otherwise, we're going to fall behind. It's not 
even a question anymore of just raceism, wrong or

14:02.517 --> 14:06.546
right. You know, the moral imperative is that the 
state is changing. You know, there's something in

14:09.733 --> 14:11.637
the battalion today. You know, I haven't even read 
it, but my guess is that it probably says that

14:11.697 --> 14:19.815
somewhere in the year 2000, you know, Hispanics in 
the state of Texas were

14:26.377 --> 14:31.946
You know, the majority of people will be Hispanic. 
The majority definitely will be Minoan over on

14:31.966 --> 14:36.052
total. This university needs to recognize that. 
Because these are people who live in the state.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.624
These are people you need to educate. And if you 
don't educate your constituency, you know, it's

14:43.644 --> 14:50.815
one of the candidates that the university itself 
becomes an irrelevant place.
