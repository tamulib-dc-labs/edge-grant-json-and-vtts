WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:08.217
I guess, in other words, the jobs will be here for 
the people who moved in, whereas in the past, those

00:02.208 --> 00:08.217
jobs have not been here. We have 8,000 jobs, plus 
probably 1,000 construction jobs. So it's 9,000

00:12.903 --> 00:18.031
jobs and probably 10,000 or 12,000 houses. So we 
almost have a job for every dwelling unit. And a

00:21.716 --> 00:23.599
third of the people who live here work here. OK, I 
was wondering what the numbers were. And the other

00:26.603 --> 00:30.949
2 thirds, a third will go downtown, and the other 
third scatters. uh and i don't think we'll

00:31.537 --> 00:56.515
probably ever get much more than half but i think 
then that when people commute out of here downtown

00:31.537 --> 00:56.515
somebody will be commuting in from yeah 
philadelphia that's okay yeah what about your

00:31.537 --> 00:56.515
transportation though is the future of 
transportation in this i mean to the outside world

00:31.537 --> 00:56.515
airports the uh we have a cold road yeah we have uh 
you know the woodlands express which is an

00:57.490 --> 01:03.598
excellent bus system from our park and ride lot, 
which has just been expanded, I think, to 800 or

00:57.490 --> 01:03.598
1,000 cars. And there's vans and buses leave from 
there every morning for people who leave their car

01:04.479 --> 01:10.827
here and do want to park in. Are you all talking rail 
service at all through here at all? Yeah. Rail

01:16.514 --> 01:22.821
takes the kind of density that we don't have out 
here and probably won't have. Is that right? I

01:24.862 --> 01:32.612
mean, if they did a high-speed rail from Dallas to 
Houston and had a stop right here at I-45, I'm sure

01:24.862 --> 01:32.612
some people would get on and go downtown. But it 
would not be supported. No, rail is pretty

01:34.815 --> 01:42.604
restricted, unless you've got a density like New 
York or downtown Atlanta or something.

01:43.405 --> 01:44.006
I don't know. Missouri caught the train. The 
airport caught the train to town. Europe said,

01:48.292 --> 01:50.074
we're not going to spend our money. It's an 
incredible world. It is, and it could be here. It

01:53.361 --> 01:53.881
could be here. It may not be where we want. This city 
spends $1 billion a year in the Houston area fixing

01:55.083 --> 02:06.517
up highways so people can get out one car at a time 
and drive back and forth. If they took some of that

02:07.338 --> 02:18.612
billion dollars a year of new highway 
construction or refurbished highways or widened

02:07.338 --> 02:18.612
highways or fixed the bridges and devoted it to 
rail and spent the money on rail, But again, the

02:18.946 --> 02:22.792
accountant mentality says if you're going to have 
a rail, it's got to pay for itself. Yeah, right.

02:23.913 --> 02:26.297
Well, the highway construction isn't paying for 
itself. That's right. Yeah, the automobile

02:26.897 --> 02:31.043
industry is one of the most subsidized industries 
in the country in that sense. You give them a free

02:31.304 --> 02:34.128
place to drive. If you gave the railroad company 
free tracks, then people probably could afford to

02:34.248 --> 02:42.119
ride on the train. But you want them to buy the land, 
build the tracks, run the things, And you won't

02:46.891 --> 02:49.435
give them a subsidy, you want them to make a profit. 
Well, that's a pretty poor business, it turns out.

02:53.881 --> 02:54.743
Now there's an alternative. Before there were 
cars, of course, railroads were wonderfully

02:54.803 --> 03:01.914
profitable for everybody, because you either got 
on the train or you rode your horse. So you got on the

03:02.655 --> 03:03.656
train. The railroaders made a lot of money. I've 
got a couple of questions that are really

03:06.741 --> 03:09.084
different. How does your job as planner and 
George, or we've been told, or at least have been

03:16.810 --> 03:29.087
given the impression that George Mitchell is 
something of a visionary in terms of the

03:16.810 --> 03:29.087
development of the Woodlands. How do you work 
together, or how does that come together, his

03:29.107 --> 03:38.620
vision, if that's, you know, if you would do that? 
George has gone to Europe and seen new towns.

03:41.383 --> 03:44.708
George came to Columbia, Maryland, saw what we did 
there. George envisioned doing a community here

03:45.802 --> 03:50.728
that was done right. Right yet to be defined. He 
liked what we all said when we started planning it

03:54.913 --> 03:59.599
and what right would be. And he supported it with 
hard cash and staff against lots of critics who

03:59.639 --> 04:11.093
said this wasn't the way to invest his money. In 
fact, we lost one company president the energy

04:13.848 --> 04:18.516
division and said, let's just stick in energy and I 
don't want to have anything to do with real estate.

04:19.317 --> 04:24.105
Well, I do, because I think we should put back into 
America some of what we're taking out. And I've

04:25.187 --> 04:35.805
always said this on George's behalf, that I think 
that he wants the Woodlands to be a role model for

04:25.187 --> 04:35.805
how the next America could be built in the next 
centuries. that instead of sprawling

04:36.393 --> 04:48.087
subdivisions around the urban centers of 
America, you could have new communities that take

04:36.393 --> 04:48.087
a lesson from the environment that's created 
here. We have the opportunity, and it's still to be

04:48.107 --> 05:04.527
undertaken, but we have people growing up in this 
lifestyle, and it ought to be measured against

04:48.107 --> 05:04.527
maybe 1960, where you got suburban sprawl, 
traffic congestion, ugly signs. I mean, what

05:08.417 --> 05:14.463
about the health and well-being of the people in 
that spot versus here? Is there really a

05:14.483 --> 05:16.765
difference? Are people more sick in one place or 
the other? Or is there stress on the human

05:19.668 --> 05:22.330
condition? One of the things I say, our 
environment reduces the stress on the human

05:22.450 --> 05:26.254
condition. It leaves you with a reservoir that 
makes you able better to cope with the other

05:26.594 --> 05:34.682
things, marital stress, job stress. children's 
stress. But on top of all of those stresses, your

05:36.013 --> 05:56.116
stress getting to and from work gets visually 
bombarded with blight and ugliness and traffic

05:36.013 --> 05:56.116
congestion and the insecurity of, like you say, 
people live five blocks in of 1960 and it goes for 20

05:36.013 --> 05:56.116
blocks. And they sit in their house and the cars 
come and go. They don't know who the hell's in the

05:58.558 --> 06:00.000
car. They see a car parked in the street and say, 
whose car is that? I don't recognize that car. You

06:04.683 --> 06:10.729
take somebody to the woodlands and they sit on 
their cul-de-sac and everybody knows whose car

06:04.683 --> 06:10.729
belongs there. There's nobody running by that 
they have to worry about. You've taken some

06:13.571 --> 06:16.974
anxiety off their security issue. Those things 
may all add up and be meaningful. I don't know.

06:21.999 --> 06:24.501
Somebody's got to measure that. Maybe you need to 
take 10,000 or 20,000 people to the woodlands in

06:24.521 --> 06:32.689
that geographic area and compare it with 20,000 
people in the 1960 area. Those are both come off off

06:34.636 --> 06:44.348
the I-45 corridor, same distance in from 
downtown, and measure what's happening between

06:34.636 --> 06:44.348
those two groups of people. Anything 
significant? I don't know. That would be a

06:47.192 --> 06:53.941
delightful cross project to do. How does the, what 
I'm trying to get at though, is how does the synergy

06:53.961 --> 06:59.007
of the woodlands develop?

07:02.142 --> 07:09.050
In other words, does Mr. Mitchell have concept, 
idea, image? Do you then take concept, idea,

07:10.992 --> 07:16.118
image, and as you say, hardline it? Or in fact, did 
you create concept, idea, and image from

07:16.138 --> 07:21.343
something much more hazy? In other words, how does 
it develop? I think George Mitchell He was one of

07:27.910 --> 07:30.813
the most remarkable guys I've ever met in my life. I 
had my own company for 25 years. I said I would be

07:33.675 --> 07:40.202
crazy to ever sell my company and go to work for 
somebody else. But George Smith was probably one

07:40.682 --> 07:44.586
of the few people in the country I would do that for. 
He had the concept of the Houston Advanced

07:44.606 --> 07:54.255
Research Center pulling together the 
universities to get grant research going, to get

07:44.606 --> 07:54.255
technology going. in Texas instead of having it go 
to Massachusetts and California and everything.

08:00.135 --> 08:01.397
Do creative ideas here. He envisioned and made it 
happen. He envisioned building a model community

08:04.782 --> 08:11.752
here and he went and visited a whole bunch of them, 
including Columbia and Irvine. And he got the

08:11.772 --> 08:18.843
people who were responsible for both and brought 
them, brought us here and said, let's, let's do it

08:11.772 --> 08:18.843
right. Let's, you know, Here are the tools it 
takes. And he's been supportive of doing it. When I

08:27.800 --> 08:30.622
told him we needed a pavilion, we agreed. And back 
in 83, we spent $350,000 doing early planning

08:30.662 --> 08:36.628
studies. We put his money where the idea was. He 
said, yes, we do need it. And then he and Cynthia got

08:42.333 --> 08:49.960
together and said, let's, when the recession was 
over here, he said, let's get Dick to get the

08:42.333 --> 08:49.960
pavilion going again. And we started out very 
modestly, like, how about $1 million? How about $4

08:54.614 --> 08:55.815
million? Well, we're up to $10 million. And we're 
still going. We've got another half a million in

08:59.158 --> 09:00.860
next year. I think it's going to get better every 
year. He has great faith and vision in that he's

09:04.864 --> 09:13.972
building for things that will be far beyond his 
lifetime. And he cares about that. I don't know if

09:17.115 --> 09:18.917
you know what he's doing in Galveston. I've been 
reading about it. He's almost single-handedly

09:20.550 --> 09:25.139
saving that island from the doldrums. He's 
brought back the Strand to the grandeur of the

09:25.460 --> 09:29.568
1890s. Are you involved in any of that? My vice 
president for planning. I've given him the

09:35.100 --> 09:37.024
Galveston project because I'm than what I have to 
do here in the Colorado project. Are you doing a ski

09:39.834 --> 09:41.836
area? That's great. It's exciting. It's obvious 
that the Woodlands Corporation, which Mr.

09:43.878 --> 09:54.228
Richmond enjoined us to call it rather than just 
the Woodlands, is also branching out into other

09:43.878 --> 09:54.228
areas beyond the Woodlands. Well, we have 60,000 
acres of real estate, and 25 of it is the Woodlands.

09:58.953 --> 10:02.777
So we've got more real estate outside the 
Woodlands. Some of it is what I call Woodlands 2,

10:02.897 --> 10:07.281
and some of Woodlands is west of here. You know, 
somebody will do it in the next century, but the

10:08.020 --> 10:17.915
market's not there yet until we're built out, and 
then they can go do another one, or a smaller one.

10:17.935 --> 10:24.445
But we happen to have 1,800 acres near Aspen, which 
we developed into what's called Owl Creek. And

10:25.667 --> 10:36.103
while I was up doing that, as project director for 
that, I found this property of 3,200 acres near

10:25.667 --> 10:36.103
Steamboat Springs and convinced George we should 
buy into that and create a joint venture with the

10:36.708 --> 10:49.806
Steamboat Ski Area to do a total resort, 
year-round resort there with a major ski mountain

10:36.708 --> 10:49.806
and there's a 500-acre lake on it. Great golf 
potential and so forth for the resort community.

10:54.513 --> 10:59.740
And the Mitchell companies and now the Woodlands 
Corporation does a lot of resort properties. We

11:00.421 --> 11:02.684
have Cape Royale up at Lake Livingston. We have 
Point Venture at Lake Travis. We've got several

11:05.750 --> 11:11.217
projects down in Galveston, the Galveston 
Country Club, Pirates Beach, Sunbird.

11:13.980 --> 11:16.203
But we do a lot of resort type communities. So the 
Lake Catamount project, although that's really

11:16.223 --> 11:23.792
the biggest one, is also a resort. So that's not a 
new word for us. We use the building in running golf

11:25.735 --> 11:30.941
courses and resort hotels and second home 
communities. So that's kind of second nature to

11:31.863 --> 11:35.487
us, whether we can carry Lake Catamount forward. 
Yet or not, I don't know. I've gotten zoning there

11:39.920 --> 11:43.505
for nearly 4,000 dwelling units. We've got a ski 
mountain for 12,000 skiers a day. And we're in the

11:48.071 --> 11:52.256
final throes of a four-year environmental impact 
statement. Of course, the $1.5 million worth of

11:52.276 --> 11:57.563
studies, we'll know by Christmas whether we've 
got it. Are you adjoining national forest lands or

11:57.583 --> 12:00.067
anything? Yeah, the ski area is on the national 
forest lands. And it's taken four years to get

12:05.555 --> 12:07.757
through there.

12:10.841 --> 12:21.652
But anyway,

12:10.841 --> 12:21.652
I'm sure you can tell I really believe that we have a 
statement here that's worthy of national

12:10.841 --> 12:21.652
attention. I think what we're doing in creating 
environments for lives is an advancement of our

12:21.672 --> 12:28.540
civilization. If we could only spread these goals 
and how to achieve them, so that more developers

12:33.702 --> 12:43.713
would band together and do bigger, more 
diverse-type projects where you could put

12:33.702 --> 12:43.713
together the bits and pieces to have a society. You 
know, we've got churches here. George has put in a

12:45.835 --> 12:51.201
private school that's at another dimension. We 
have daycare centers. We've got 41 lakes we've

12:53.703 --> 12:56.366
built so far here. We're all very natural in 
respecting the environment and enhancing the

12:57.267 --> 13:02.072
environment. Our wildflower program, which 
George insists on funding, again, why do you want

13:03.132 --> 13:13.207
to spend $35,000 every year on wildflower seeds? 
But we want this place in the spring to be awash with

13:13.227 --> 13:16.412
flowers. It's just another way of man and nature 
enjoying one another. The color here in the spring

13:22.962 --> 13:25.145
is just gorgeous. Well, it should be interesting 
to see if this, in fact, becomes a prototype for it.

13:30.193 --> 13:30.473
Yeah. Well, I think it will. It'll always be 
honored for being a better place in Houston to

13:34.570 --> 13:39.115
live. Yeah, right, nothing else. And I worry a 
little bit because I grew up next to Radburn, New

13:40.076 --> 13:50.967
Jersey, which was done by Clarence Stein, an 
architect out of New York in the early 30s, and it

13:40.076 --> 13:50.967
fell during the Depression. And it still has a 
waiting list of people to get in. It never got

13:54.090 --> 14:00.156
finished because it went bankrupt, but they had 
open space and pathways and parks. similar to what

14:00.743 --> 14:03.907
we have in our villages, as a matter of fact. And I 
can read here, if you think the woodlands is good,

14:04.567 --> 14:13.558
you can go to Tapiola in Finland outside of 
Helsinki and see a new town that was built in the

14:04.567 --> 14:13.558
50s. It's every bit as good as what we've done. And 
that's a poor country, Finland. And so people do.

14:21.327 --> 14:26.413
There is a common denominator between the 
different cultures of people. given the

14:27.085 --> 14:29.568
opportunity, we'll produce the same kind of 
thing. Socio-economic mix of housing in the

14:29.808 --> 14:43.864
forest, close to nature, providing stimulation, 
providing recreation, providing education,

14:29.808 --> 14:43.864
giving people a chance to optimize their 
environment and the quality of their lives. And

14:44.986 --> 14:54.797
it's sad to see that 99% of the housing that gets 
built in the United States is just shelters being

14:44.986 --> 14:54.797
thrown on 20 acres here and 40 acres there. and we 
spread people in a thin veneer across the

14:55.064 --> 15:01.991
countryside without any pattern or organization 
of their life support systems. It's really cruel,

15:02.852 --> 15:08.317
and that's why the New Communities Act was such a 
fine idea. Why can't we organize the economic and

15:09.599 --> 15:21.831
demographic forces of this country such that we 
promote community development instead of

15:09.599 --> 15:21.831
suburban sprawl bedroom communities? That's not 
right. We can do better than that. The

15:24.697 --> 15:33.205
environments that we're studying so hard now to 
put on a space platform are what we should be doing

15:24.697 --> 15:33.205
for our everyday living. Why don't we put the same 
effort into that as we are for spacewalking or

15:33.586 --> 15:40.993
space orbit, orbital living? Probably we're 
going to learn things up there that will bring back

15:41.013 --> 15:43.796
that. Well, they are learning the psychology of 
living, I guess, and part of what's going on.

15:48.160 --> 15:48.981
That's exactly right. That's a very good 
overview. Don, do you have any other thoughts we

15:54.818 --> 15:57.641
ought to... Put yourself in our shoes for a minute, 
or whoever's shoes you may be wearing. One of the

16:04.970 --> 16:15.563
things that Mr. Mitchell wanted us to do was to 
concentrate on the last six to eight years and the

16:04.970 --> 16:15.563
future. What events, what ideas, what 
developments, initiatives are going to matter

16:24.164 --> 16:31.033
the most that have happened in the last half dozen, 
eight, ten years? Okay, the creation of HARC,

16:31.053 --> 16:44.669
which is spawning high technology jobs, not only 
for the Woodland, but for the Houston region, and

16:31.053 --> 16:44.669
bringing in bright minds and families to work and 
live here. People who are committed and

16:46.432 --> 16:50.557
appreciate the quality of life and will help 
support it. Creation of a private school, provide

16:54.033 --> 17:16.143
for those same kind of people who are really 
oriented toward making sure their kids get a jump

16:54.033 --> 17:16.143
start toward the technology of the future, which 
is going to require a lot tougher academic

16:54.033 --> 17:16.143
achievement than most people allow their kids to 
get away without.

17:19.207 --> 17:22.572
I think the cultural maturing of the cultural And 
the festive side of the woodlands is maturing. The

17:26.953 --> 17:31.840
pavilion has been a big recent addition to that. 
Yeah, it sure has. We've

17:33.743 --> 17:38.470
got a good program. Yeah. If I could just 
summarize. I have to backtrack a little bit. Sure.

17:40.653 --> 17:52.390
I think in the last recent years, the most 
important thing is that PARCC was brought on and

17:40.653 --> 17:52.390
has been successful in generating the interest in 
the university support that it has, and now in

17:40.653 --> 17:52.390
research. and high-quality, high-tech jobs in 
industry and the development of industries for

17:52.859 --> 17:58.246
the future. But the venture capital group that was 
formed, again, with Georgia's seed money that now

17:58.887 --> 18:19.575
takes some of that research and finds the 
commercially viable projects and spawns new

17:58.887 --> 18:19.575
companies, creates new jobs, which some of them 
might take off and be really important to the

17:58.887 --> 18:19.575
Houston and Texas economy. I think the private 
school adds a dimension to help attract the finer

18:20.399 --> 18:25.468
minds. You know, at Park they're doing particle 
research and laser research and things that are at

18:27.491 --> 18:42.858
the front edge of where our society is going, 
technically, and the computer setup that they

18:27.491 --> 18:42.858
have there. Those things are all fantastic. And 
then simple things like interfaith and the

18:46.370 --> 18:58.242
religious community that's evolved in the 
Woodlands and all the churches and the fact that

18:46.370 --> 18:58.242
the school system has supported us in adding 
schools as they're needed. And I used to say also

18:59.303 --> 19:11.555
another important thing, too, is we can plan and 
strive to build an environment or an envelope for

18:59.303 --> 19:11.555
people to come and put their lives in. When we're 
done, the success of the Woodlands is going to

19:12.116 --> 19:16.140
depend a lot on just who moves here. Because in the 
long run, it's the quality of the people that are

19:18.955 --> 19:28.388
here and how they work together to build a 
community and have an allegiance to themselves to

19:18.955 --> 19:28.388
make a better place. And I think we can give them a 
head start by giving them something that's

19:30.050 --> 19:36.118
functionally better. The

19:37.039 --> 19:44.128
people that come here are really important. I 
think the future is is the expansion of the town

19:46.968 --> 20:15.557
center, both through the mall, the Lake Robins 
business complex that's right next to the mall,

19:46.968 --> 20:15.557
the canal down to the pavilion, and the kind of 
generation of cultural, recreational, and

19:46.968 --> 20:15.557
commercial activities that can have, which can 
rival San Antonio in the future, which brings them

19:46.968 --> 20:15.557
12 million visitors a year, where Tivoli Garden in 
Copenhagen brings 12, 15 million people from

20:16.043 --> 20:20.788
Europe during the three or four month summer 
season. Our canal from the pavilion to Lake Robins

20:20.808 --> 20:28.877
can be a destination place for the whole country to 
come. And I think these are things to do for the

20:28.897 --> 20:42.672
future that can build in this whole business 
complex that we really become the northern

20:28.897 --> 20:42.672
satellite hub of Houston right here in the 
wilderness. That sounds exciting. We appreciate

20:44.039 --> 20:47.637
your time and interview very much.
