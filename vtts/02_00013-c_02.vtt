WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:10.809
There's a feeling of territoriality, if that's the right word, I'm trying to be very polite, between the people in INA and the people in the program.

00:11.511 --> 00:17.343
However, as Hamilton, the head of the program, said to me the other day, neither can exist without the other, and they have to get along.

00:17.804 --> 00:22.073
And there's little turf battles, but that's in any department.

00:23.909 --> 00:31.240
I wish the I&A had a hundred million dollar endowment, or even a ten million dollar endowment, and that's one of the things I want to work on in my retirement.

00:31.480 --> 00:40.534
Okay, then to whom, over all these years, to whom do you feel the most gratitude?

00:42.252 --> 00:52.479
Oh, without any doubt whatsoever, Ann, who was a better pianist than I am an archaeologist probably years, good and gave up her entire career to traipsy around the world.

00:52.559 --> 00:57.291
And I said to her once, you know, don't you resent that.

00:57.271 --> 01:00.515
And she said no because she was a child of the 50s like I were.

01:00.555 --> 01:06.922
And a young South Carolina girl, that was her, you know, what she grew up is to get married and be a wife.

01:07.142 --> 01:08.664
And today that doesn't hold.

01:11.046 --> 01:17.374
But, I mean, she could have directed an excavation like Debbie Carlson now could direct an excavation because she's not a child of the 50s.

01:17.454 --> 01:21.338
She's married, but she has her own life.

01:21.318 --> 01:33.784
I can never repay her for being the person that would be my free secretary, my free bookkeeper, my free, you know, volunteer, everything, everything.

01:34.265 --> 01:36.930
Who else over these 30 years?

01:41.213 --> 01:48.225
Rodney Young, my professor, who set an example for me and everyone.

01:48.245 --> 01:54.697
I dedicated the first volume in the Texas A&M University Press Series for Nautical Archaeology to him.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.028
He cared far more about his students than about his own career.

02:01.008 --> 02:15.005
He was a very modest man, he was a bachelor, a big guy who had been badly wounded in the Second World War and used to ride a motorcycle, very tough guy.

02:16.186 --> 02:21.953
But people didn't know that, I didn't know that he was an heir to the Budweiser.

02:22.658 --> 02:25.382
family, and he left no will.

02:25.783 --> 02:33.275
He talked to me about how we would, our institute would invest a certain amount of money, and I just treated it very lightly.

02:33.295 --> 02:35.579
And he said, what would you do with a certain amount of money?

02:35.619 --> 02:38.423
I won't say the amount, but it would have helped us a great deal.

02:38.403 --> 02:44.333
And then he was still in this car crash, and his nephew was his cousin, said, you know, he kept saying, I've got to write my will, but he hadn't.

02:45.034 --> 03:01.622
But the reason I say that he's had an example is that I found out that when he would say that the museum had made a special grant to me to be able to pay me for a trip through New Year's to visit museums to help publish a site or something like that, I found out later that that just came out of his pocket.

03:01.823 --> 03:03.145
But he didn't want me to thank him.

03:04.154 --> 03:06.561
You know, he was an incredible man.

03:07.323 --> 03:08.466
And all of the students think that.

03:08.726 --> 03:12.477
For example, when I went to Penn, there were only four of us working for PhDs.

03:13.179 --> 03:15.565
Crawford Greenwald, Jr., Charles Williams,

03:16.675 --> 03:18.058
Arthur Steinberg and myself.

03:19.059 --> 03:24.710
Crawford Greenant Wall now is the director of the Sardis excavations in Turkey, probably the major American land excavation in Turkey.

03:25.692 --> 03:31.923
Charles Williams became director of the Corinth excavations, the major American excavation in Greece, probably.

03:32.404 --> 03:34.848
I became director of the Underwater Stuff, which has made a mark.

03:35.209 --> 03:36.912
And the brightest of us all,

03:36.892 --> 03:41.662
Arthur Steinberg, went in the field once to Gordon, didn't like sand in his face and flies.

03:42.163 --> 03:44.187
And so he never, he gave up.

03:44.207 --> 03:45.750
But he could have also been the same.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.954
But he teaches the humanities at MIT.

03:48.455 --> 03:50.259
But he just didn't want to be a field archaeologist.

03:50.279 --> 03:52.183
So that was because Rodney,

03:54.374 --> 03:56.218
almost forced us to go out and become great.

03:56.338 --> 03:58.302
I mean, he made us publish.

03:58.362 --> 03:58.963
Now publish.

03:59.484 --> 04:01.268
Give a talk at this AIA meeting, you know.

04:01.628 --> 04:11.427
Whereas when I'd been under another professor once at one point in my career, and I asked if I could publish some material from an excavation that I'd worked on, he said, oh, no, no, no.

04:11.748 --> 04:16.838
You should never try to publish anything until you're at least 40 years old and have the weight of experience behind you.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.948
And look at the difference.

04:19.028 --> 04:24.159
When I was 28, I was drinking my own excavation, and that was good.

04:24.360 --> 04:24.620
All right.

04:24.801 --> 04:25.963
Any other names you want to mention?

04:25.983 --> 04:28.208
You mentioned your wife and your teacher.

04:28.288 --> 04:30.152
Anybody else you want to include in your?

04:31.094 --> 04:37.902
Well, from Texas A&M, I would have to say Vaughn Bryant is very high on the list because he was so supportive as head of the department.

04:38.022 --> 04:41.587
And he was the only head I've ever known because I've been gone since David Carlson.

04:41.607 --> 04:43.509
I became department head, and now I'm retiring.

04:43.549 --> 04:47.294
So, Vaughn, Claude Dutwy.

04:47.935 --> 04:48.956
I said I'd name him again.

04:49.016 --> 04:50.137
Spell his last name.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.360
D-U-T-H-U-I-T.

04:53.639 --> 04:55.441
He lent me his tent for my honeymoon.

04:56.422 --> 04:58.645
He's the one that said, get back into archaeology.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.610
I used to pay him $120 a month to be our chief diver.

05:04.192 --> 05:06.815
And then our lives just stood apart.

05:07.216 --> 05:13.083
And only because I broke down in a car once driving down through the Robin Piercy did I say, I have a French friend in Paris.

05:13.103 --> 05:14.064
Let's just call me.

05:14.084 --> 05:15.026
We can drop by and see him.

05:15.546 --> 05:16.748
He asked me about INA.

05:17.048 --> 05:18.410
He wanted to know all about it.

05:18.810 --> 05:21.013
He said to spend the night

05:20.993 --> 05:24.642
Now, you may have heard of people going from College Station to Paris for their honeymoons.

05:25.023 --> 05:28.411
Can you imagine somebody coming from Paris to College Station on his honeymoon?

05:29.393 --> 05:32.019
Claude and his wife came here.

05:32.059 --> 05:34.064
We're the best of friends.

05:35.047 --> 05:36.049
But not only that,

05:37.717 --> 05:40.121
He is the grandson of Henri Matisse, the painter.

05:40.943 --> 05:44.649
So in the last several years, he has come into an incredible fortune.

05:44.749 --> 05:46.011
I don't even want to know what it is.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.395
But he was my major sponsor this year.

05:48.455 --> 05:55.808
So a guy that I used to hire can now turn around and give over $100,000 to me for what I'm trying to do.

05:56.349 --> 06:02.880
And so he comes with his wife and stays with us every year in College Station for a week or two.

06:02.860 --> 06:04.462
When I can, I'll stay with him in Paris.

06:04.522 --> 06:17.120
But I think that the thing we enjoy more than anything in life is just be together now at this time in our lives in Turkey, going out and diving and playing with submarines and being at sea.

06:17.541 --> 06:22.007
And it's funny because at night we sit down and we check our pills in the morning because he's had a major heart attack.

06:22.027 --> 06:23.149
He's got prostate cancer.

06:23.169 --> 06:23.810
I've had a stroke.

06:23.830 --> 06:24.771
I've had skin cancer.

06:25.172 --> 06:29.037
And we complain about our ailments while we're diving.

06:29.135 --> 06:36.149
You ought to write an O. Henry-like true short story about this.

06:36.289 --> 06:39.976
Because, you know, somebody would say, now wait, wait, wait, that's fiction.

06:39.997 --> 06:41.019
That couldn't have happened.

06:41.399 --> 06:45.267
And that here you would hire this man for this figure and now he's this.

06:45.888 --> 06:51.379
That you would get help from him and then he would come here.

06:51.359 --> 06:56.487
Then, two things left then.

06:57.028 --> 07:07.585
Let's make believe that someone handed you a check for a million dollars, which you were then to pass on to A&M, but you got to decide the use to be made of it.

07:08.366 --> 07:13.975
If you could make a generous, generous gift to A&M, what would you want done with that gift?

07:17.515 --> 07:30.316
I would want it to be spent as seed money to never pay for more than one half of a survey or an excavation or some field project.

07:31.658 --> 07:34.663
Because I think if you're handed all the money, because I've seen this happen,

07:36.533 --> 07:44.640
You don't have the same incentive to publish quickly, to prove yourself, to get on television, and all the things that spreads the work around.

07:45.421 --> 07:50.405
And, you know, one of the more expensive items every year for those of us working in Turkey is travel.

07:51.146 --> 07:57.851
So, you know, a certain amount could maybe be set aside as travel funds for graduate students.

07:57.871 --> 07:58.632
So that would be it.

07:58.972 --> 08:01.034
A field fund.

08:01.915 --> 08:05.578
I mean, they're always going to be able to support the books in the library because of people like Sterling Evans.

08:06.149 --> 08:15.047
Presumably they're never going to lose student assistantships, although some of those right now are due to this endowments I raised through the I&A directors.

08:15.067 --> 08:19.937
There's a Siegfried Fellowship, there's a Cook Fellowship and so forth, so.

08:21.040 --> 08:21.641
Last question.

08:22.563 --> 08:24.647
What are your feelings about Texas A&M today?

08:32.137 --> 08:35.101
I would embarrass you.

08:36.603 --> 08:41.410
I would embarrass you because you'd think I was making it up.

08:42.071 --> 08:42.972
I mean, it's just wonderful.

08:43.653 --> 08:57.672
I'm saying that in my commencement address, that I went to a small private intellectual place, Johns Hopkins, and then I joined the faculty of an Ivy League university.

08:58.073 --> 09:05.968
And I wondered what it would be like to come to a land-grant university, a state university, a large university, and it was just the best choice I ever made in my life.

09:06.449 --> 09:14.525
I mean, I get – there are certain things that maybe, you know, for example, I'm a Democrat.

09:14.545 --> 09:18.833
Probably 80 percent of the students on campus are Republican.

09:20.365 --> 09:29.137
I love to go to football games, but the level of college sports sometimes bothers me because I think, you know, this is really the minor leagues of professional sports these days.

09:29.217 --> 09:40.492
And at Johns Hopkins they didn't even charge admissions to the football games, and yet I was a cheerleader, the same as the year old leader here, and I got the same kick out of watching us play Lafayette and Swarthmore and places.

09:40.532 --> 09:48.263
I mean you can still have good school spirit without having it big business.

09:48.243 --> 09:53.731
I, I just, I, I, well, I don't know, I'll probably stay here, La Dai in College Station.

09:54.131 --> 09:56.455
Um, it, it's, it's a, it's a great institution.

09:56.875 --> 10:01.642
And, and one of the things that happened is, is since I've been here, when I first got here, there was no ancient historian.

10:02.403 --> 10:07.390
There were no, I think Spanish and, a little German and Czech were, or maybe French were the only languages.

10:07.891 --> 10:11.556
Now you can take Japanese, you can take, um, Greek, you can take Latin.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.482
Um, maybe you can take Arabic, I don't know.

10:16.643 --> 10:21.109
We used to ask students to go over to the University of Texas Austin to get courses like that.

10:21.129 --> 10:22.070
We don't have to do that anymore.

10:22.611 --> 10:24.874
Now, whether that's good or bad for Texas A&M, I don't know.

10:24.934 --> 10:27.598
I mean, it's not what Texas A&M was founded for.

10:27.778 --> 10:37.912
And as you know, being a historian better than I do, the entire faculty was fired for teaching the classics in their third or fourth year out of existence.

10:37.932 --> 10:39.734
And administration too, I think.

10:40.255 --> 10:42.919
So, you know, I don't know whether that's good or bad.

10:43.019 --> 10:43.900
I think that

10:45.078 --> 10:50.288
As the university grows and with more liberal arts, I think that it will lose some of this unique spirit.

10:50.368 --> 10:52.492
I think that is almost bound to happen.

10:52.532 --> 10:56.158
For example, everybody no longer says howdy when you pass them on the sidewalks.

10:56.419 --> 10:57.080
It's just too many.

10:57.421 --> 10:59.164
You'd be saying howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy.

10:59.645 --> 11:01.088
It used to happen when I first got here.

11:01.548 --> 11:07.339
I suspect when I got here it was more like 20 or 25,000 students than the 40 or 45,000 today.

11:07.319 --> 11:14.667
So I think that it can lose some of that unique spirit while developing the arts.

11:15.268 --> 11:15.668
I don't know.

11:16.629 --> 11:26.721
Ann said once that she had never met a group of people more comfortable in their skin than the Texas A&M alumni who had gone through the Second World War.

11:28.903 --> 11:30.545
She just said that they just were very special.

11:31.827 --> 11:32.407
No question.

11:32.868 --> 11:34.069
No question.

11:35.517 --> 11:40.888
Are you ready to let that be the last, do you have a last line or a last thought?

11:42.712 --> 11:42.852
No.

11:42.872 --> 11:44.615
I mean I'm getting quite choked up about that.

11:44.655 --> 11:46.479
That's true, you know.

11:46.499 --> 11:49.425
All right, let's quit then.
