00:08.654 --> 00:13.939
Okay, is it

00:08.654 --> 00:13.939
15? Okay, now, would you list the important events 
you think of in terms of organization that occur

00:13.959 --> 00:22.568
that change the nature of oceanography? Well, 
scientifically, from the scientific point of

00:22.588 --> 00:33.798
view, the first that I can, in my time, was the 
writing of the book The Oceans by Spherdrup,

00:22.588 --> 00:33.798
Johnson, and Fleming.

00:36.581 --> 00:38.543
The second was due to his And Sproul's 
forethought, getting 15 and more picked young

00:39.400 --> 01:03.079
scientists trained who became head or leaders in 
practically every oceanographic institution in

00:39.400 --> 01:03.079
the country and was the nucleus on which the 
scientific development could be built. The third

01:04.898 --> 01:14.773
was the Office of Naval Research Organization for 
the purpose of supporting research in the

01:04.898 --> 01:14.773
government.

01:17.577 --> 01:32.340
Organization-wise, oh, and then you must put into 
consideration the work of Revelle and Bennett and

01:17.577 --> 01:32.340
Wakelin and all of that group and the expansion of 
oceanography in such things as the International

01:32.793 --> 01:47.834
Geophysical Year, and following on down through 
those projects to the International Decade of

01:32.793 --> 01:47.834
Ocean Exploration, which is now going on. Those 
plans were absolutely essential. Also

01:54.241 --> 02:13.891
important, both scientifically and 
organization-wise, was the Informal

01:54.241 --> 02:13.891
Coordinating Committee within the Navy, which 
became the Interagency Oceanographic

01:54.241 --> 02:13.891
Committee, which became Wenck's commission 
under Humphrey toward the last. The TANOC plans

02:16.014 --> 02:23.505
put out by ONR, the establishment under Harrison 
Brown the great work of defining what

02:24.228 --> 02:45.821
oceanography should do, the National Committee 
on Oceanography, NASCO,

02:24.228 --> 02:45.821
the follow-through of

02:24.228 --> 02:45.821
the Stratton Report, which unfortunately met a 
political situation which was not fruitful.

02:48.045 --> 02:52.952
These were some of the milestones, as I saw them, 
Now, finally, if you should like to be remembered

02:55.598 --> 03:02.098
for your major contribution to oceanography, 
what would you choose? Myself? For yourself. That

03:07.154 --> 03:08.157
was a good program, man.
