WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:24.975
and grabs it like this, and he falls on the floor, and Gus Hamblett, who, you know, you know Gus, anyhow, Gus just, you know, fell on his knees, he had a beer in his hand that spilled on the kid, which made it run that much more, which looked like it was, you know, really going good, and Gus was crying, you know, and the students had unplugged what they thought were all the phones,

00:24.955 --> 00:31.702
Well, Marvin knew the house real well and knew there was a phone somewhere and went and called the police.

00:32.863 --> 00:40.310
So, anyhow, everyone was standing around the student and the student, you know, after a couple of minutes decided, oh, this is enough, enough.

00:40.330 --> 00:52.802
So they, and in the meantime, Jerry and two of the other faculty members had registered the gunman, had wrestled him to the ground and had his hands behind his back when the guy popped up and,

00:53.086 --> 00:56.151
I said, joke's over, you know.

00:56.171 --> 00:58.013
Of course, Gus was about to kill him at that point.

00:58.494 --> 00:59.395
And then the police came.

00:59.836 --> 01:03.602
Of course, there hadn't been any murders in College Station and they were just delighted, ooh.

01:04.844 --> 01:12.315
And so Staisal quickly ran out and was stationed himself with his pipe against the front pillar, pretending like nothing was going on.

01:13.136 --> 01:14.879
And the police came in and they said, where's the body?

01:15.560 --> 01:16.521
He said, what body?

01:17.282 --> 01:20.046
And they said, well, there's reported a murder.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.068
And he said, no.

01:21.453 --> 01:24.599
I think somebody must have been playing a practical joke on you.

01:25.060 --> 01:25.962
There's no murder here.

01:26.022 --> 01:27.745
So they went running through the house.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.969
In the meantime, of course, windows were opening.

01:30.330 --> 01:32.755
People were throwing out stuff and flushing commodes.

01:33.135 --> 01:39.327
And Romnick ran out the back door, not wanting to be caught with his crew.

01:39.762 --> 01:54.537
Then, let's see, I guess one of the wildest things that happened on campus was either my second or third year here, they always, second year, always had this cute little pumpkin carving thing for the community.

01:55.678 --> 01:58.801
And they would invite first and second graders in to see the carved pumpkins.

01:59.722 --> 02:04.326
So my class was going, oh, you know, why do we have to do something that rinky-dink?

02:04.386 --> 02:06.208
And I said, well, why don't we have a haunted house?

02:06.931 --> 02:07.992
And they said, oh, OK.

02:08.012 --> 02:09.975
Hey, that sounds like a great idea.

02:10.495 --> 02:13.218
So I approached Romnick, and Romnick said, OK, OK.

02:13.819 --> 02:16.723
So essentially, they closed down Building C for a day.

02:16.763 --> 02:24.251
And then we built this haunted house with all sorts of bizarre things in it.

02:24.952 --> 02:27.275
There was only one thing censored.

02:27.295 --> 02:28.597
And Stace will censor that.

02:28.857 --> 02:34.103
One of the kids had a vet student as a roommate who had sewn together

02:34.083 --> 02:41.058
this creature that was on ice that he was going to open up for people to view and Stacey said, no, let's not, you know.

02:41.559 --> 02:45.949
So, but they had things like a coffin that was rigged with speaker systems.

02:47.552 --> 02:49.797
People would get in it and then they had recorded

02:49.777 --> 03:04.610
literally dirt being piled on until you could no longer hear the people singing, and then it went into this electronic music, and they had a guy that, the hangman, you know, that would, and he looked, they put glaze on him where he looked like he was waxed.

03:04.630 --> 03:15.740
People would walk by and he'd grab them, and they had gallows out in the courtyard that were, you know, with a fake rope, and anyhow, it was pretty elaborate.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.602
And about two hours into it,

03:18.970 --> 03:26.204
You know, there were kids out on the front lawn crying, you know, mothers chasing students around with their purses, you know, because they were frightening the kids too much.

03:26.785 --> 03:29.150
And so anyhow, it was open for another night.

03:29.951 --> 03:34.600
So Romnick had us phone the radio station saying nobody under

03:34.580 --> 03:39.065
you know, 10 admitted because of the scary nature.

03:39.545 --> 03:42.108
Well, it was crowded the first night.

03:42.568 --> 03:46.012
The second night, you couldn't even get through the building, so one of the buildings didn't collapse.

03:46.332 --> 03:47.253
Maybe it was thick.

03:48.194 --> 03:51.517
And Romnick never let us have another haunted house.

03:52.458 --> 04:00.807
He got so many irate phone calls, you know, from mothers and people like that.

04:02.457 --> 04:08.649
As you first became acquainted with Aggie students, you were nicely impressed with their capability?

04:08.669 --> 04:09.831
Oh, yeah, work ethic.

04:09.851 --> 04:10.452
Their work ethic?

04:10.472 --> 04:10.993
Capabilities.

04:11.013 --> 04:12.015
Uh-huh.

04:12.035 --> 04:19.710
Generally, can you characterize, can you describe them in general in those early years?

04:20.031 --> 04:22.896
Because later we want to see if they've changed, but...

04:23.180 --> 04:25.203
Where were they from and what were their backgrounds?

04:25.223 --> 04:34.939
They were mainly rural Texas, you know, and well, of course, Houston, Dallas, and Santa Monica, but we had a lot of Army brats and Air Force brats here.

04:35.660 --> 04:42.651
But they were actually more open-minded than anybody because they'd lived, experienced other cultures and things like that.

04:43.712 --> 04:49.221
Then we had the few people from New York, which were funny to have around.

04:49.201 --> 04:53.405
Did they tend to be first-generation college students?

04:53.806 --> 04:56.728
I would say a lot of them are first-generation college students.

04:56.748 --> 04:58.951
If we had to classify them liberal, conservative?

04:59.651 --> 05:00.993
Oh, always conservative.

05:01.853 --> 05:04.156
What did they think they were going to become?

05:04.196 --> 05:07.459
What were their professional career goals?

05:07.519 --> 05:17.689
Most of them thought they were going to be architects, with a few exceptions, like Robert Riggs, who just used it to get a degree, and then he got into, you know, journalism.

05:17.669 --> 05:21.657
And then Max Greiner never wanted to be an architect.

05:21.677 --> 05:23.802
His dad was captain of the 50s football team.

05:25.265 --> 05:29.293
And his dad sent him here because the closest thing to art was architecture.

05:29.935 --> 05:35.847
And so Stasel and myself and a couple of the other faculty did special classes for him.

05:35.827 --> 05:40.053
He might sign up for my fourth year design, but he was off doing art projects.

05:40.894 --> 05:46.361
And then he went to work, you know, well he now has his own gallery and his sculptor and painter and everything else.

05:46.942 --> 05:54.812
And then like Chris Novak that did sets for Saturday Night Live and he's done sets for several movies.

05:55.232 --> 05:59.658
He did learn Bernstein's Requiem set and traveled through Europe with that.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.403
But like, he wanted to be a stage designer.

06:03.383 --> 06:13.117
So Stasel worked out a deal with the Alley Gallery and had him go down his entire senior year and co-op down there.

06:13.537 --> 06:14.959
And then we put him in dummy classes.

06:15.800 --> 06:21.949
And so he graduated and then got accepted into Yale for their master's program in stage design and then just skyrocketed.

06:21.929 --> 06:28.516
And, you know, that was sort of the tenure and the mood of the environmental design.

06:28.556 --> 06:32.681
It was like, what can we help the students achieve?

06:33.361 --> 06:38.707
It's not like you will go through this sieve and you will come out and architect.

06:39.948 --> 06:48.898
Stacey was happy if they were a good, happy taxi cab driver or, you know, or whatever, whatever they wanted to be, but he was essentially trying to facilitate

06:48.878 --> 06:52.303
their future by opening as many doors as possible.

06:53.545 --> 06:58.032
During those first years, how aware were you of the campus administration?

06:58.894 --> 07:00.556
President, vice president of academic reform?

07:00.576 --> 07:02.960
Well, Rudder, I'd always heard really good things about.

07:04.703 --> 07:12.034
That he was a benevolent dictator, but he was very fair, and that most of his decisions

07:12.318 --> 07:13.659
you know, seemed to be very good.

07:15.181 --> 07:16.382
Did you all see him very much?

07:16.982 --> 07:17.563
Not that much, no.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.505
Did he come down to the architecture?

07:19.525 --> 07:21.166
No, I would hear things from Romnick about him.

07:21.186 --> 07:22.528
I guess they were in the poker club together.

07:23.769 --> 07:25.590
There was a group of about seven of them.

07:26.431 --> 07:26.952
The what club?

07:27.152 --> 07:28.053
It was a poker club.

07:28.073 --> 07:28.753
Oh, yes, yes.

07:28.773 --> 07:34.579
Was it Winernie and Romnick and a bunch of them, Rudder, and they would all go play poker.

07:35.259 --> 07:38.843
And that's where a lot of the campus business got attended to.

07:39.403 --> 07:41.245
Let's see, Winernie was the only one that had

07:42.878 --> 07:44.940
A little bit of a run-in with him.

07:44.960 --> 07:45.100
Really?

07:45.381 --> 07:55.051
Well, I mean, he came in one day and he decided that for the new health center that he was going to have me carve a wooden deal for him.

07:55.071 --> 07:58.134
And I said, well... Now, this is in the 70s, in the 80s.

07:58.514 --> 07:58.795
No, 70s.

07:58.815 --> 08:00.216
70s, yeah.

08:00.236 --> 08:03.520
And I said, well, okay, you know, I'll be glad to work with you on it.

08:03.540 --> 08:08.565
And then the next time he met me, he said, well, I've worked out a deal where you can retain ownership.

08:08.545 --> 08:11.850
and we'll just display it for you," which, you know, I smelled.

08:11.870 --> 08:16.517
And I said, well, I tell you what, it's okay with me if you all own it.

08:18.240 --> 08:23.068
And this was before I was tenured, so, you know, you sort of let go, hoping.

08:26.112 --> 08:28.055
John Calhoun, did you see much of him?

08:28.076 --> 08:32.402
Yeah, I would see Calhoun more than most, and I still see him around the time.

08:32.422 --> 08:35.447
Did y'all have an impression of the central administration?

08:35.427 --> 08:40.716
Was there ever anything that seemed to be leaning a little bit more to the technical?

08:42.118 --> 08:48.448
Seemed like Jack Williams was maybe the first one that seemed to be a little bit more liberal arts, more like a college president.

08:49.270 --> 08:59.106
And then after him, all the ag sort of fill-ins, you know, everyone was just like, you know.

09:01.128 --> 09:05.579
By the time we get to the early 70s, now you came in 60 what?

09:06.381 --> 09:06.601
Nine.

09:06.621 --> 09:07.163
69.

09:07.263 --> 09:07.464
All right.

09:08.145 --> 09:09.709
We go into the early 70s.

09:09.910 --> 09:10.832
Mr. Rudder dies.

09:11.233 --> 09:15.002
Jack Williams becomes president in the fall of 70.

09:16.214 --> 09:18.377
and we're looking forward to the centennial.

09:19.258 --> 09:23.563
How did you come to do that panel over in the MSC?

09:23.623 --> 09:25.586
Describe that, how... Well, I'm not real sure.

09:25.786 --> 09:34.157
I think it was between you and Romnick saying that they were talking about little ceramic plates and other little, you know, paperweights and stuff.

09:34.217 --> 09:38.542
And they said, well, there should be something that is substantial that actually commemorates it.

09:39.543 --> 09:43.268
And I think the nice thing about it was

09:43.248 --> 09:51.158
When I met with the committee, they said, here's six areas that we want to find, which was great.

09:51.198 --> 09:51.939
You had freedom.

09:52.400 --> 09:57.807
And then you went over to the archives and you found out there was no history of A&M because Detloff was still working on his book.

09:58.648 --> 10:02.093
There was no photo essay of A&M.

10:02.894 --> 10:11.685
And so I went through, I guess, all the annuals at least five different times, trying to go through it page by page.

10:11.665 --> 10:19.976
I went through shoeboxes full of old mementos and things that Aggies that had died, their family had packed up the stuff and sent it back.

10:20.817 --> 10:29.890
And then, oh, Profs Emeritus were a really good source, the ones that were still here in town.

10:30.511 --> 10:33.775
And then the Profs in the different colleges were really good.

10:33.755 --> 10:39.162
As to what was currently going on, the people that had the least knowledge of what was happening in their college were the deans.

10:40.463 --> 10:41.044
Seriously.

10:41.544 --> 10:42.766
They were clueless.

10:43.567 --> 10:48.993
And you could go down to the next level where the profs were doing all the research, and they could tell you everything that was happening.

10:49.754 --> 10:51.096
So that was interesting.

10:51.236 --> 10:59.166
About how, from the time that you were first approached about doing that until you finished it, about how long was that?

10:59.446 --> 11:00.387
Two years.

11:00.367 --> 11:09.786
so 74 to 76 yeah and we finished it two weeks before were you given any dimensional

11:11.015 --> 11:12.537
Not really.

11:13.298 --> 11:20.449
And how long did it take you to decide how many panels, of what size?

11:20.590 --> 11:23.835
Well, I knew there'd be six panels because there were six Suffolk areas.

11:23.855 --> 11:27.200
And then, you know, researching it, you know, there could have been more than that.

11:27.841 --> 11:29.764
But I just put it all together.

11:29.944 --> 11:35.993
It was three months from the time I started researching until the time I ended up with cartoons that I could show the board.

11:35.973 --> 11:37.215
Right.

11:37.676 --> 11:42.105
And you did some, what, paper, I mean, pencil drawings?

11:43.227 --> 11:43.367
Mm-hmm.

11:43.387 --> 11:44.089
Pencil drawings.

11:44.229 --> 11:45.611
At quarter scale.

11:46.273 --> 11:46.413
Mm-hmm.

11:46.433 --> 11:47.495
So they were just like this.

11:48.818 --> 11:58.977
And then I had everyone look them over, and with the exception of the four X-rated words from the Corps, they were pretty much approved.

11:58.957 --> 12:02.975
So that no one attempted to say, thou shalt not do this or this or that.

12:03.116 --> 12:04.582
No.

12:04.603 --> 12:04.824
Okay.

12:04.864 --> 12:08.038
And what, they seem to be pleasantly, you know, surprised.

12:08.525 --> 12:15.512
Were there any people that you particularly now look back and say you're grateful for their help or encouragement or anything like that?

12:15.552 --> 12:16.773
Well, yourself and Romney.

12:17.834 --> 12:18.314
Okay.

12:18.835 --> 12:21.277
And you picked walnut?

12:21.718 --> 12:22.238
Yeah.

12:22.258 --> 12:22.819
Why walnut?

12:23.519 --> 12:27.023
Because if you can do really small detail, it needed to be either pecan or walnut.

12:27.743 --> 12:34.650
And walnut I like to work with because it holds the detail a little bit better.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.714
Did you get it from any special place?

12:37.974 --> 12:39.617
Fred Lanehart here in town.

12:39.917 --> 12:40.558
Lanehart.

12:40.578 --> 12:42.701
Yeah, he's a cabinetmaker that's been here forever.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.526
He's probably, I would guess he's in his 80s.

12:48.268 --> 12:53.575
But he went out looking, and I think he got it all from Kansas.

12:54.096 --> 12:55.218
And he glued it up for you?

12:55.238 --> 12:56.239
Right, it was out of one tree.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.822
So the color would be the same.

12:59.724 --> 13:03.709
And he glued the whole thing up and delivered it.

13:03.807 --> 13:07.716
Was that, had you done anything of that dimension before?

13:08.618 --> 13:16.315
Yeah, the Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas was the same roughly size commission.

13:17.729 --> 13:19.411
Was there anything before that?

13:20.132 --> 13:24.317
Well, there were small welded, did welded sculptures.

13:24.357 --> 13:28.722
I worked my way through Berkeley, selling at the Cannery in Chiardelli Square, you know, galleries there.

13:29.623 --> 13:36.371
And May & Company, Macy's in New York, came to San Francisco and saw my stuff in a gallery there.

13:37.112 --> 13:40.716
And they ordered 40 pieces in my last semester, which was great.

13:40.696 --> 13:52.090
When you finished it, describe whatever kind of opening, unveiling ceremony and so forth that you remember.

13:52.542 --> 14:00.256
Let's see, well, they had the whole thing veiled, of course, and they did a series of speeches, which was kind of a daze at the time.

14:01.658 --> 14:08.771
And then when they dropped it, it was fun to hear, you know, just a complete silence and then, you know, the sighs and stuff.

14:08.791 --> 14:11.135
That was really neat, hearing that.

14:11.636 --> 14:13.740
And my parents were here at the time for that.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.546
And you said you finished two weeks?

14:17.007 --> 14:17.287
Ahead.

14:18.189 --> 14:18.309
Ahead.

14:18.329 --> 14:23.740
And that gave Jerry Cooper time to photograph them all from the next Texas Aggie magazine.

14:23.761 --> 14:28.911
Were there any near cataclysms or... Well, the only...

14:28.891 --> 14:35.479
I guess the only thing that could beat that would be Reveille had the nerve to die after we had already carved the panel she was on.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.143
And so we had to fit in the next Reveille.

14:40.285 --> 14:44.190
And so it isn't masked as if it belonged there.

14:44.370 --> 14:45.491
It's a little tight.

14:46.793 --> 14:57.666
As you look back now with a quarter century of vision, is there anything that you wish you had included or wish you hadn't included?

14:58.321 --> 14:58.862
Not really.

14:59.222 --> 15:10.616
I was pleased with the way I could have Aggies from the 80s to freshmen that would come and think it was done for their age.

15:11.837 --> 15:13.960
They all found themselves in it.

15:14.841 --> 15:16.843
And so I was real pleased with that.

15:17.484 --> 15:25.273
And there wasn't anything, I guess the only thing that I guess puzzled me was there's only one element that keeps getting broken off.

15:25.253 --> 15:30.004
And that was the baseball bat paddles on the core thing, which was the hazing.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.852
And that's been broken off maybe four different times.

15:34.614 --> 15:36.518
And they finally just decided not to replace it.

15:36.719 --> 15:43.414
Do you think that perhaps the, that it was not totally accidental that the, those battle pads were broken off?

15:43.394 --> 15:44.936
Oh, I'm sure it was on purpose.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.323
Now, where did you do the carving?

15:49.544 --> 15:50.165
In our garage.

15:50.265 --> 15:50.806
In the garage.

15:52.989 --> 15:54.932
Vertical or horizontal?

15:55.272 --> 15:55.693
Horizontal.

15:56.154 --> 15:59.179
And we had some stands built especially for them.

15:59.199 --> 16:07.832
And then we had the garage door taken down and a glass door put there so we could get some good light in and air conditioner put in.

16:08.723 --> 16:13.249
And during that, your work routine was what?

16:13.269 --> 16:13.650
The same.

16:13.670 --> 16:14.571
It was full-time teaching.

16:14.731 --> 16:16.413
No, I know that, but did you?

16:17.194 --> 16:18.316
Oh, okay.

16:18.336 --> 16:25.185
Well, Sue, at that point in time, our kids were, you know, like two and four years old.

16:26.006 --> 16:32.475
And so we hired a babysitter that would be there during the day that would occupy them while Sue was out carving.

16:33.376 --> 16:36.300
And then I would come in at five and start carving.

16:36.331 --> 16:37.556
And she'd start fixing dinner.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.363
And then I would carve till midnight.

16:39.865 --> 16:43.860
And then on weekends, both of us would carve and take turns watching the kids.

16:44.954 --> 16:49.178
So, in fact, did she do almost half of it?

16:49.198 --> 16:50.399
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:50.419 --> 16:55.704
She's, her undergraduate degree was actually in anthropology.

16:55.784 --> 17:04.493
She was taking a dual degree in art and science, and she was at Duke for a couple years, and then she transferred back to Newman because she's from New Orleans.

17:05.113 --> 17:13.982
And she was thinking of just going straight sculpture, and then she realized that she could use all of her credits and get an anthropology degree.

17:13.962 --> 17:20.752
So she took some courses in anthropology and a lot of really good courses in sculpture and finished her degree there.

17:20.992 --> 17:30.606
And then her father, who's a doctor, said, you'll not be able to manage with a sculpture background and make a living, so you have to do something else.

17:30.626 --> 17:35.073
So she fell back on her science and went to physical therapy school at Stanford.

17:36.034 --> 17:42.163
And so anyhow, instead of doing physical therapy,

17:42.143 --> 17:49.257
She ended up doing the panels, and then as soon as those were over, she went into physical therapy.

17:49.277 --> 17:54.688
And had you had any courses, any coursework in?

17:55.109 --> 17:56.091
Yeah.

17:56.111 --> 17:57.213
Well, both my parents were artists.

17:57.594 --> 17:57.975
Yeah.

17:57.955 --> 17:59.777
And dad was advertising artist.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.841
My mother was more of a painter, fine arts.

18:03.822 --> 18:13.835
And so I was raised just like that was normal everyday stuff that you painted, you did pastels, you did, I mean that was normal stuff from this high up.

18:14.656 --> 18:17.900
And in college I had some sculpture courses that were fun.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.102
You know, I had some interesting time with them.

18:20.663 --> 18:24.688
And then I went to work with Hal Box who ended up being the dean at UT.

18:24.668 --> 18:38.158
And he had an old house in Highland Park that he was remodeling and the guy that owned it was a big entrepreneur and he had five private dorms he wanted to do around the country.

18:38.619 --> 18:42.728
And it was a small firm and he was seeing dollar signs of these private dorms.

18:42.708 --> 18:46.914
So he went all out on redoing her house, remodeling and additions.

18:47.495 --> 18:49.899
So there was a big old Highland Park house.

18:50.239 --> 18:52.563
They added this back, you know, den area.

18:53.203 --> 18:57.530
And you went up these huge stairs and a giant landing and then up another huge stairs.

18:57.550 --> 18:59.853
Then you would have to circle back to get to the den.

19:00.434 --> 19:02.137
And I said, well, why not?

19:02.217 --> 19:05.762
On that landing, you put in some carved stair treads.

19:06.232 --> 19:10.301
that were spiral that would take you right to the den and then you don't have to go all this way around.

19:10.802 --> 19:15.232
And she had literally Louis XV furniture, rosewood and bronze.

19:15.673 --> 19:17.577
She had needlepoint window shades.

19:17.597 --> 19:19.401
I mean, the place was ornate.

19:19.421 --> 19:22.688
So I designed an Art Nouveau pattern on the stair transit.

19:22.668 --> 19:32.101
Well Hal Box went in for the bidding and as he was sitting down the contractors were snickering saying there are no woodcarvers in Texas.

19:33.082 --> 19:39.771
And so they gave her this bid without the woodcarver and they said there aren't any woodcarvers, we wouldn't know where to go.

19:40.452 --> 19:46.541
And she was furious, she said I fall in love with that, I'm not going to go on with the remodeling unless my stairs are carved.

19:46.581 --> 19:51.207
And he said not to worry, we have a woodcarver in the office.

19:51.187 --> 19:53.349
That's how he came up with the idea.

19:53.369 --> 19:59.777
And so he came back the next day and sat down with his elbows on the table and looked at me and said, guess what?

20:01.038 --> 20:02.459
You're going to carve some stares at night.

20:04.101 --> 20:15.574
As you look back on those panels at the MSC, have there been any particular individuals and or special comments that you treasure in your

20:15.554 --> 20:16.215
in your heart?

20:17.417 --> 20:20.482
Any special person who said they've done anything?

20:20.502 --> 20:28.795
Well, most of them, I guess I would like just the comments that they said they felt it belonged to them.

20:29.636 --> 20:35.726
I mean, like, to me, that would be the ultimate artist compliment if you're communicating.

20:36.367 --> 20:40.093
And it seems to communicate with all the different people.

20:40.073 --> 20:47.672
Occasionally I'd meet people over in, or in another town even, and be chatting, and there would be an Aggie there and said, did you ever go to A&M and see that?

20:47.692 --> 20:50.419
And they would go, oh my god, yeah, and then they would go on and on.

20:50.800 --> 20:57.357
And then several foreign visitors, evidently, that have come to campus have made comments about them before.

20:57.337 --> 21:02.044
Has anybody ever teased you about a Texas Tech graduate doing it?

21:02.425 --> 21:03.807
Yeah, yeah.

21:03.827 --> 21:04.107
Is that right?

21:04.287 --> 21:14.903
Well, Ron Skaggs occasionally will tease me about that, and I said, you know, after being here 31 years, I said, when A&M plays Tech, I root for A&M.

21:15.444 --> 21:25.639
In fact, my dad would get furious, because even in the 70s, when A&M would play Tech, I would phone him up if A&M beat and razz him about it.

21:26.159 --> 21:37.265
because you and I share, being non-ANM undergraduates, when did and how did your roots get into Aggie soil?

21:37.306 --> 21:42.137
When did you begin to feel a devotion to this institution?

21:42.157 --> 21:44.623
Oh, probably, well, doing the research.

21:44.603 --> 21:45.244
Okay.

21:45.264 --> 21:45.825
On the panels.

21:46.767 --> 21:46.867
Okay.

21:46.887 --> 21:50.173
You know, I felt it was an incredibly special place to be.

21:51.014 --> 21:56.103
You know, I could hardly think of any other place, you know, that would have that kind of history, you know, in Texas.

21:56.344 --> 22:05.380
And the administrators I met, other faculty members, with a few exceptions, you know,

22:05.360 --> 22:28.836
were always welcoming, they were warm, they weren't cold, and other universities that I've been at, you know, there was a lot of back batting, people being lofty and snatty and things like that, and it just seemed to be a really special place to be, and a place that you could do things, experiment with things, come up with new things on your own without people saying you had to fit within a little confine.

22:28.816 --> 22:30.839
Was the dean part of those?

22:31.259 --> 22:32.541
Oh, yeah, Romnick was great.

22:32.821 --> 22:35.585
Describe him as the leader of the college at that time.

22:35.745 --> 22:39.650
Well, he would let you do anything, and he would support you.

22:40.331 --> 22:42.173
And it didn't matter whether he agreed or not.

22:43.635 --> 22:50.864
Like, to get my class to work together as a team, a lot of times the first week of class, I would have them build their classroom.

22:51.666 --> 22:53.608
So they had to create an environment.

22:54.466 --> 23:04.739
And one of them, they brought in chicken wire and made plaster, decoupage-type stuff, and created a free-form organic shape.

23:04.879 --> 23:08.223
And he would come in going, oh, my god.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.625
But he would back off.

23:09.645 --> 23:10.406
He wouldn't say anything.

23:11.147 --> 23:14.972
But it's completely against Romnick, because Romnick is less is more.

23:14.952 --> 23:20.181
You know, everything is structured and pure, and I was the total opposite end.

23:20.682 --> 23:26.793
He would have a coronary if he walked in my living room, because he would just go, oh God, because it was eclectic as all get out.

23:28.616 --> 23:35.408
But he would never call me down and say, no, you have to do it like the Institute of Technology in Illinois.

23:35.388 --> 23:54.510
And even, which is, probably don't want this on tape, but Mad Max Granner, who was in third year, he built spaces up there, and they sort of did it with stretch burlap and stuff like that.

23:54.490 --> 24:01.076
So anyhow, they were having their grand opening on a Sunday night, and they invited Stace on that.

24:01.096 --> 24:10.705
And so we walked in, and in this brown furlap, there was this fake black fur, and then pink, foamed, it was a vulva, and with a little horn at the top.

24:11.405 --> 24:18.872
And he had stretched some plastic across it, and they put a condom they'd made out of cleaning bags and pushed Stacell through it.

24:20.153 --> 24:21.114
And that was their space.

24:21.715 --> 24:24.497
But, you know, Romnick,

24:24.477 --> 24:47.464
that was the only thing that Romnick had them modify because he was out driving on campus and got to about where the engineering building was and looked up and could see an eight foot vagina in the architecture building and thought that's gone beyond so he did have them take that down but that's the only thing that he's ever without your without him telling you or without your asking

24:48.507 --> 24:52.673
What did you sense, though, were in fact his basic guidelines?

24:54.235 --> 24:55.717
His basic guidelines were excellence.

24:56.458 --> 25:04.148
You know, as long as whatever they did in the class, the students excelled and learned about themselves and about the field.

25:04.869 --> 25:06.671
That was all he really cared about.

25:07.312 --> 25:10.937
And whatever means you used to get there was okay by him.

25:10.917 --> 25:16.064
To whom did you turn for other opinions, advice, information, or whatever?

25:17.085 --> 25:26.498
Probably John Ferry, Jerry Maffey, Cecil Stewart when he was here, some of the landscape faculty.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.382
You know, Mike Murphy's been here quite a while.

25:29.682 --> 25:35.432
Now did the, were there faculty meetings on a regular basis?

25:35.993 --> 25:38.657
Yeah, but not too many, you know, maybe once or twice a semester.

25:38.757 --> 25:39.018
Okay.

25:40.360 --> 25:44.407
And the program, when you first got here, had about how many students, I reckon?

25:44.427 --> 25:44.587
350.

25:44.607 --> 25:45.228
350.

25:45.368 --> 25:46.030
Uh-huh.

25:47.172 --> 25:48.814
And now it's about 1850.

25:49.856 --> 25:52.821
And it's gotten up to be, I think, 2100 at one point.

25:52.801 --> 26:02.524
Help trace from the late 60s, go up into the, what were some of the important steps in the growth and progress?

26:03.061 --> 26:17.541
Okay, Romnick was probably the most positive direction because he took the College of Architecture before it was a college, when it was still a department under engineering, and then in 62 made it into a College of Architecture.

26:18.322 --> 26:19.283
Not really, it wasn't either.

26:19.904 --> 26:20.905
School of Architecture.

26:21.226 --> 26:25.812
And then in 69 he changed it to a College of Architecture, creating all the different departments.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.996
And by then it was the 4 plus 2.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.398
Right, it was the 4 plus 2.

26:30.099 --> 26:33.605
And then he started the Doctor of Environmental Design, which changed to the PhD.

26:34.507 --> 26:38.353
And construction science changed from building construction to construction science.

26:39.215 --> 26:48.390
And then he was asked to leave, I guess, by the Board of Regents because of the McGraw thing in Carpus.

26:50.176 --> 27:16.453
Joe McGraw evidently had done something that offended one of the Board of Regents and he was conducting a class in Carpus off campus or something and it wasn't allowed so they told Romnick to fire him and Romnick refused to fire him and so he said you'll have to either fire him or you'll have to step down as dean so he stepped down as dean and then that's how we ended up getting stuck with Raymond Reed for a few years

27:16.433 --> 27:17.515
Okay.

27:18.416 --> 27:21.260
Yours truly was dean of faculties at that time.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.545
I mean, I might not be getting the right story.

27:24.605 --> 27:25.686
No, no, on the read.

27:27.769 --> 27:30.593
Because as far as I know, you're correct on the other part.

27:31.354 --> 27:34.819
And I get there just about that time.

27:35.821 --> 27:39.947
As far as you recall, how was the search conducted?

27:40.908 --> 27:41.769
For Raymond Reed?

27:42.290 --> 27:42.390
Yeah.

27:42.370 --> 27:58.557
When they brought everyone in, Raymond Riegel was like number four or five on the list, and as we understood it, the administration didn't want to pay for any one of the other four, and Raymond didn't ask for a price tag, so they hired him the cheapest.

27:59.347 --> 27:59.868
Right.

27:59.908 --> 28:01.832
This is a note to the typist.

28:02.112 --> 28:03.395
This would be an editorial note.

28:05.359 --> 28:12.132
There was included in the group a man who was then at the University of Arizona that was way up near the top, if not the top.

28:13.555 --> 28:19.887
And yours truly and Richard E. Winerdi, W-A-I-N-E-R-D-I, we were very impressed with him.

28:20.052 --> 28:23.763
as was John C. Calhoun, the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

28:23.783 --> 28:27.012
And one afternoon we asked Dr. Calhoun, do you want him?

28:27.093 --> 28:28.256
Yes, he's the best, isn't he?

28:28.276 --> 28:30.282
Yes, we think he is.

28:30.397 --> 28:33.200
Then get on the phone, see if you can get him.

28:34.001 --> 28:34.862
What about the salary?

28:35.022 --> 28:37.205
Pay whatever it takes, because we want high quality.

28:38.206 --> 28:43.592
We got on the phone, and we did, and we reported back to him the next day what had happened.

28:43.692 --> 28:44.734
Good, what was the salary?

28:44.774 --> 28:45.174
We told him.

28:45.194 --> 28:47.517
He said, oh, that's much too high.

28:47.537 --> 28:49.419
But you told us pay whatever.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.882
Well, no, that's too much.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.963
So we called him back and he then withdrew.

28:55.024 --> 29:01.993
And by then, as far as I recall, Reed was about the only one left, period, quote.

29:02.013 --> 29:02.754
Okay, end of note.

29:04.816 --> 29:09.102
On this machine, what do you think was the general reaction of the faculty?

29:09.122 --> 29:10.323
You don't have to... With Raymond Reed?

29:10.343 --> 29:11.885
Yeah.

29:11.905 --> 29:13.347
They were pretty depressed.

29:13.327 --> 29:22.307
They felt like they were sort of the weak sister, that they were just having somebody pushed off on them because they really didn't count for much.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.204
Now, how is Bill's leadership style different from Romanek's?

29:27.689 --> 29:32.578
Raymond was... I won't get sued for all this long.

29:32.598 --> 29:33.820
A sweeping judgment.

29:34.361 --> 29:42.236
He went up to Stasel, John Ferry, Bob Schiffre, Karen Hager, anybody that had an art background would say, you don't belong in our faculty.

29:42.777 --> 29:46.303
You have no business teaching any of our students anything.

29:46.283 --> 29:50.909
And he said, I'll work my hardest to get rid of all of you.

29:50.929 --> 29:53.032
And, you know, they were the key to the beginning of design.

29:53.532 --> 29:57.658
And so he put, so Stasel was department head at the time.

29:58.259 --> 30:07.110
So to placate Raymond Reed, because Raymond couldn't get rid of them because they were all tenured, he put me in teaching freshman design because I was an architect.

30:07.664 --> 30:10.049
knowing full well that nothing would really change.

30:10.089 --> 30:23.780
And so Raymond, who never really saw what anyone was doing, because he never checked, you know, and he couldn't get rid of them, you know, said, okay, if Rodney's teaching freshman design, that's okay then.

30:24.401 --> 30:27.107
But... He was dean about how long?

30:27.357 --> 30:29.501
maybe five years or six.

30:29.721 --> 30:30.382
Who follows?

30:30.462 --> 30:30.983
Charles Hicks.

30:31.945 --> 30:34.269
Describe him and his style.

30:34.349 --> 30:36.452
Charles Hicks was an engineer.

30:37.274 --> 30:38.656
Came from where?

30:38.716 --> 30:39.718
He was teaching over in Civil.

30:40.279 --> 30:42.562
And I guess he went with the Construction Science faculty.

30:43.604 --> 30:47.330
And he was in two years, I think.

30:48.512 --> 30:51.998
And he was like

30:53.125 --> 30:54.127
No leadership at all.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.649
I mean, as if he didn't exist.

30:56.190 --> 31:03.622
I mean, it was like if it wasn't for the faculty who was moving forward, you know, I mean, he just really didn't exist.

31:04.102 --> 31:06.807
But between he and Raymond created enough scandals.

31:07.788 --> 31:16.101
During those years, who were the faculty members providing the leadership within the College of Architecture that deserve a pat on the back?

31:16.242 --> 31:20.989
Stacell, Dan McGilvery, I guess himself.

31:22.893 --> 31:27.359
John Ferry, James Marsh, Bob White.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.786
And the land development program, is that what it's called?

31:32.806 --> 31:33.707
Yeah, Wolfgang Russell.

31:34.008 --> 31:36.091
Yeah, began during that period.

31:36.431 --> 31:37.533
And Wolfgang was really good.

31:37.653 --> 31:38.554
Wolfgang was strong.

31:39.075 --> 31:41.678
He didn't care who was dean or who he had to step on.
