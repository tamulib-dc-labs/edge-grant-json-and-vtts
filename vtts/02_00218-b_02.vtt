So I told the freshman, I said, hey, fighter, won't 
you give him that bell back? And he said, sir, don't

00:05.596 --> 00:09.181
you think it'd be good and bold if we took this back 
to campus with us? I said, yeah, it would, but I

00:09.201 --> 00:12.966
think they really want that bell, so you give it 
back to them. And I could tell he was real

00:12.986 --> 00:15.169
disappointed in my manhood. But I thought that was 
the best thing to do under the circumstances, so we

00:16.530 --> 00:20.295
gave him the bell back. But that was one of those 
memories you have. I thought, oh, we're fixing to

00:23.940 --> 00:27.905
get pounded good here. They took the bell and went 
on their way, so thank goodness for that. It's now

00:32.414 --> 00:33.238
noon. Let's quit. We're about two-thirds, 
three-fourths of the way through. And let me come

00:38.205 --> 00:40.095
back.
