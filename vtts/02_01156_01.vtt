WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:16.705
If you will, if you'll tell me your full name, for 
starters, and a little about... My name is Alec,

00:01.904 --> 00:16.705
A-L-E-C, Christopher Sears.

00:21.031 --> 00:23.194
And where you were born and raised? Born in 
September 7, 1918, in Abilene, Texas, and grew up

00:23.214 --> 00:31.185
in a town west of there called Merkle, 17 miles.

00:40.105 --> 00:43.529
I went to high school and graduated there. I spent 
two years in McMurray and Abilene. Then I went to

00:53.540 --> 01:00.447
Texas Tech, Lubbock, for a degree in agriculture. 
animal husbandry, minor in economics.

01:09.800 --> 01:30.552
The

01:09.800 --> 01:30.552
succeeding year, I had a graduate fellowship to 
the University of North Dakota at Fargo to work, to

01:09.800 --> 01:30.552
teach, and I'm

01:30.987 --> 01:36.936
going up to Bismarck in June. I'm giving a talk on 
the grasslands. I enjoyed my years up there.

01:44.047 --> 01:56.826
Anyway, I taught half time, went to school half 
time, and earned a master's in animal husbandry

01:44.047 --> 01:56.826
and a minor in economics.

01:59.759 --> 02:04.466
kind of taking off on the education part here. I'll 
go back and pick up my early life.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.816
While we're on it, I might as well finish. While in 
North Dakota, my research project dealt with

02:12.538 --> 02:28.382
vermifuges and parasites in sheep, and I worked 
closely with the veterinary division there in the

02:30.235 --> 02:36.080
school.

02:40.044 --> 02:43.987
I became very interested in veterinary medicine.

02:49.693 --> 02:57.880
This was partially due to my younger brother, two 
years younger, dropped out of Tech and went back

02:58.113 --> 03:07.584
and ran our ranch

02:58.113 --> 03:07.584
at south of Abilene. Constable was married before 
I was, and I felt that the ranch was not large enough

03:09.206 --> 03:21.561
for two people to be managers. So that's the reason 
I went up and got my master's. no thought of it

03:27.914 --> 03:29.896
before that. Had

03:31.357 --> 03:40.846
you started by using your husband's degree for 
county agent work or anything like that? Well, I

03:41.086 --> 03:47.952
had written some letters and I didn't seem very 
excited about what was offered. And this happened

03:48.333 --> 03:50.434
in my senior year. I didn't have a very big gap. They 
had two previous doing the same project with

03:57.007 --> 04:02.734
sheep, something with their sheep. And of course 
Dr. Stangle there at Texas Tech recommended me for

04:04.096 --> 04:20.097
it because I happened to be president of Block 
Bridal Club and I had raised and been on the cattle

04:04.096 --> 04:20.097
rights and sheep rights. When did you finish Tech?

04:27.078 --> 04:27.398
Boy. That's all right. I graduated up from North 
Dakota at 42, and two years there, so that would be

04:29.761 --> 04:39.173
39 to 40. Yeah, just so I can. Yeah.

04:49.946 --> 04:55.313
If you want me to drop back, or I can drop back on my 
childhood earlier, I mean later. Let's go on with

04:58.454 --> 04:59.475
this. The sequence will be better for you, I 
believe. While I was there, of course, the World

05:04.420 --> 05:17.151
War II broke out in December and I graduated in June 
or so of the following year. And I had enlisted in

05:17.171 --> 05:24.017
the Marine Corps during my senior during my second 
year and

05:24.487 --> 05:40.734
had written a thesis, written a paper and a thesis 
and the Marine Corps called me in before

05:24.487 --> 05:40.734
graduation time. The faculty was very 
sympathetic

05:47.200 --> 05:51.705
gave me my exam and accepted this work that I'd 
already done as my thesis. But I'm lucky. You are.

05:57.091 --> 06:16.532
Anyway, I went into the service about March, April 
of 42 and was a, went into the Marine Officer School

05:57.091 --> 06:16.532
and came out a second lieutenant, a Marine, I don't 
think that has a lot to do with veterinary

06:17.474 --> 06:24.004
medicine. I went to Honolulu

06:24.104 --> 06:40.528
and then joined a defense battalion that was in 
Palmyra, one of the islands that was the next one to

06:24.104 --> 06:40.528
be invaded.

06:42.179 --> 06:43.200
I remember not so good. You had a small stroke on . 
Yeah, no, before that. Anyway, before, when we

06:49.647 --> 06:51.610
turned them around. Yeah. was the next . And I was 
there a short while, and then came back and changed

06:55.694 --> 07:05.085
into a field cartel. I had lots of, quite a bit of 
math, and the Marine Corps tried to use your word.

07:12.571 --> 07:15.895
best fitted, and that certainly saved me a lot of 
walking. Vietnam, I'd have been in Vietnam, not

07:16.496 --> 07:20.901
Vietnam, but Guadalcanal. My outfit would have 
gone to Guadalcanal if I'd been in anything but

07:22.203 --> 07:31.274
artillery or coastal artillery. But anyway, I 
came back and then went out to Majuro on a different

07:31.314 --> 07:42.308
outfit. there for a few months, and came, I was 
overseas 23 months, and came back to the United

07:43.047 --> 07:52.720
States. Pacific all the time? Yes, Pacific all the 
time. And went back to Quantico to an advanced

07:56.886 --> 08:05.618
course, and then went back to San Francisco to be 
deployed again. Funny thing that probably the

08:12.089 --> 08:23.241
European war ended while I was going to Quantico, 
and the Japanese war ended while I was on the road to

08:12.089 --> 08:23.241
San Francisco, so I never went back. I was lucky not 
to end up in the occupation.

08:33.152 --> 08:34.673
Okay, from there I... When did you leave service? 
about December 4th, 6th, and I applied for

08:41.468 --> 08:55.282
application to three veterinary schools, 
Cornell and... So you had kind of decided during

08:55.302 --> 08:58.905
the war what you wanted to come back and do. Yes, 
that made up my mind. My brother was running the

09:01.548 --> 09:08.635
ranch until he went into the service, and then of 
course he came back about the same time I did. Went

09:08.655 --> 09:11.037
back to the ranch. So I figured that would be the 
best way to go. Cornell and Colorado and A&M. A&M

09:24.042 --> 09:30.612
accepted more of my previous college work than the 
other two. And therefore, I really would have

09:31.493 --> 09:36.300
liked to have gone to Cornell. But I thought it was a 
better school. It rated better. Yeah, it did. It

09:40.406 --> 09:41.007
was an honor. But that's not for the book. But 
anyway, I went to A&M, the veterinary school, in

09:43.269 --> 10:00.265
January, I believe, mid-semester of 46, and 
graduated in 49. I hit some of the, most of the, I

10:00.465 --> 10:10.335
don't know, three-year schedule at that time.

10:11.362 --> 10:12.924
at least a high sophomore. All my English and most 
of my chemistry and all that was done in history.

10:20.636 --> 10:24.983
But I graduated in 49 from A&M. You were with GI 
Bill. Yes, uh-huh. And I taught in the animal

10:27.167 --> 10:32.695
husbandry.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.757
I was married at that time. I didn't know I asked the 
other. Yeah, I was married and had two children

10:34.939 --> 10:37.723
during that time. So I had to have a little bit more 
than you have to be able to get through. So I taught

10:42.140 --> 11:01.117
in the animal husbandry, mostly

10:42.140 --> 11:01.117
dealing with the judging team, stock doings, and 
telemetry, animal

10:42.140 --> 11:01.117
husbandry. Do you remember anything special 
about any of your professors down there when you

11:01.137 --> 11:06.242
were there, or any special professors? Well, we 
had a few characters, but Dr. Turk was a fellow of

11:07.268 --> 11:14.715
parasitology. My name is Turk. Did you know Tom, my 
name, while you were there? No. What year did he

11:21.922 --> 11:23.544
graduate? About the same time. I was going to look 
at his degree. He was 47. So he's down to 47. I

11:31.952 --> 11:36.516
crisscrossed with some of the 48s, but not 47. 
Anyway, Dr. Turk and, oh, who was the... I think

11:42.599 --> 11:43.920
Marcel is still around. Yes, he was our dean. And 
Dr. Smith. Yeah, he was the head of the physiology

11:50.366 --> 11:54.610
department. I'll think of him in a minute. I have a 
small stroke. a few years back, and I have trouble

12:05.386 --> 12:07.808
on recall. I can think of it. It's fine. But if I try 
to think of it, it just won't come. And the anatomy

12:14.495 --> 12:28.087
teacher, a tall fellow, blond, very 
instrumental. I enjoyed him. Of course, a few of

12:31.230 --> 12:34.093
you didn't enjoy him.

12:37.246 --> 12:40.491
Now was the emphasis you felt like when you were 
there a large animal? Oh yeah, definitely. You

12:42.374 --> 12:47.401
didn't have much... No, you couldn't get in if you 
wanted to be a small animal. I intended to be a large

12:47.421 --> 12:52.109
animal too with my agricultural background. It 
was easy to do that. So you finished in 49 and then

12:56.315 --> 13:00.021
what did you do? I looked around for various places 
to practice and I ended up in Longview, Texas.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.512
setting up a mixed practice. By yourself? Yes, new 
practice. And how'd that work? It worked fine. I

13:17.319 --> 13:29.670
had all I could do and was at the point of having to 
hire another veterinarian when I decided that

13:17.319 --> 13:29.670
maybe I'd sell and come to West Texas. We were, my 
wife's in North Dakota and I was West Texas, and

13:36.528 --> 13:40.154
East Texas is different. I was very successful 
there and sold my practice. Had it on the market

13:45.642 --> 13:47.185
three days. Is that right? Yeah. Now you had an 
edge, it strikes me, maybe on some of these other

13:50.690 --> 13:56.679
people, because you had a lot of economics 
background. You bet I did. I made all of that. And

13:59.344 --> 14:03.430
you know, this is a question I ask all these people. 
What was your business? Because I see the practice

14:06.530 --> 14:09.374
of veterinary medicine as a business. Oh, it is. 
And apparently that's one of the real

14:10.596 --> 14:13.980
deficiencies that a lot of these people have had. 
Well, I ended up with four. I'm going to tear this

14:16.724 --> 14:18.026
thing up here. I had four hospitals here, and that 
helped me on that. I branched out, and I had a

14:24.355 --> 14:29.402
partnership and so forth. But when I sold those, 
that's my retirement. And it's... And so that's

14:34.814 --> 14:37.417
the economics part of it. That's important. And I 
raised that question with Calvin Price and

14:38.599 --> 14:44.727
several people, you know, and apparently the 
curriculum... I had Texas Tech, too. I had a

14:45.628 --> 14:50.154
good... That was one reason I asked for it up there. 
And the curriculum just doesn't have room,

14:50.575 --> 14:54.960
apparently, for anything like that. I think 
that's a real one. Oh, it's where a big lot of

14:56.022 --> 14:58.425
them... their education, I think. So how long were 
you in Longview? About two years, probably two

15:02.851 --> 15:04.933
years. So you set up a practice that you could 
actually sell in two years. That's pretty good.

15:09.698 --> 15:10.919
Yeah, yeah. That's pretty good. I didn't ask 
enough because it sold too quick, but it sold to a

15:11.600 --> 15:23.672
fella in Kilgore that had a practice over there and 
knew, he grew up in Longview, in Marshall, so he

15:11.600 --> 15:23.672
knew the area. We were good friends.

15:28.510 --> 15:32.214
I looked around and tried to go into Dallas. And you 
saw without knowing where you were going? No,

15:36.638 --> 15:38.019
that's right. You were very brave. Well, 
hard-headed maybe. But anyway, Dallas was nearly

15:42.464 --> 15:49.831
a closed city as far as building veterinary 
hospitals. You had to find some

15:49.851 --> 15:57.218
county land inside Dallas to get the zoning right 
to build a hospital. And so I looked at court work,

16:01.371 --> 16:09.941
which really I loved more than I did Dallas, but 
thought there was more opportunity over there.

16:11.383 --> 16:27.002
And found out that they'd had a new zoning rule that 
allowed you to go into areas that you couldn't go

16:11.383 --> 16:27.002
into otherwise.

16:30.222 --> 16:35.968
Now, has this been a continual problem for the 
practice, that is, your zoning problem? See, we

16:36.008 --> 16:42.434
are criticized for noise, barking, and for odors. 
It's been a real problem down through the years.

16:48.620 --> 16:58.710
And St. Louis

16:48.620 --> 16:58.710
formed a, not a resolution, a law, a zoning law, 
formed a new zoning law that allowed the

16:59.500 --> 17:09.711
veterinarians to go in with pretty much a closed 
building. And that made all the difference in the

17:09.731 --> 17:12.594
world. Because you were accepted, if you followed 
that one, two or three zones that you couldn't have

17:12.614 --> 17:20.922
gone in otherwise. And you could go in residential 
areas that are close to residential areas, which

17:21.583 --> 17:28.090
you needed to be. Has that been pretty well adopted 
now? Yeah, so it's universal. But it came out of St.

17:32.207 --> 17:33.428
Louis? Yes, and it came out about 51, 52,

17:33.448 --> 17:45.901
about 52, 53, something like that. Most everybody 
knows that. There was one guy named Bill. Two

17:50.886 --> 17:58.093
hospitals in Fort Worth just before I came and 
couldn't move in them, built them. And I thought he

17:58.242 --> 18:12.258
would qualify, and then the city adopted that

17:58.242 --> 18:12.258
building along, and I was able to do what I wanted 
to. So you come on over to Fort Worth? Yes, and I

18:14.080 --> 18:16.123
worked in Dallas. And then you go to the hospital 
right away? I worked in Dallas for about three

18:17.665 --> 18:26.595
months, but then I built my hospital and my home. on 
the west side of Ridgely area. And you're probably

18:30.626 --> 18:34.632
unique again, and you've got capital to start out 
with. Well, I used my ranch to... You got some

18:34.852 --> 18:39.338
credit. ...as equity. My father died when I was 12. 
I need to go back and cover that somewhere, but a

18:44.225 --> 18:56.903
man, when we became of age, my mother deeded his 
part to us of the ranch, which was in Memphis. case,

18:57.288 --> 19:12.730
a section, and I used it for financing over and over 
again with Southwestern Life as a loan on it, and

18:57.288 --> 19:12.730
take that money and invest it in the hospital. And 
it's been very, very good for me. But I think, and I

19:15.233 --> 19:20.140
had an uncle who loaned me $10,000. So by the time I 
was building a house and everything, I didn't have

19:20.160 --> 19:25.067
enough. Never, never. You need an uncle or a 
grandfather or a father that finances you. And

19:37.785 --> 19:40.308
you're unique in that. And you're unique that, I 
want you to make this point, that we have something

19:41.329 --> 19:48.237
to sell when we retire. We're not like dentists and 
particularly MDs. They have a lot of trouble.

19:56.789 --> 20:03.235
selling their establishment, MDs, selling their 
practice. And we have the practice plus physical

20:03.255 --> 20:18.870
building and income coming in, which is tougher at 
the beginning, but it's better at the retirement.

20:19.550 --> 20:23.674
Most of them, a lot of them haven't even thought 
about that.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.714
Yeah, I picked up on that from a number of people. 
You have to provide your own retirement in our

20:27.754 --> 20:35.662
family. Your social security is just a drop in the 
bucket. Let me go back and pick up a child. Yeah, go

20:45.152 --> 20:51.419
ahead, because your father died when you were 
young, and your mother is running the ranch. Yeah.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.522
My father died when I was 12. And I was the oldest 
child of five children. And she ran the ranch,

20:59.440 --> 21:07.348
living in Merkle, with the ranch 35 miles south of 
there. We had a very good foreman who continued for

21:09.691 --> 21:13.535
several years. And then we had another very good 
man who was a foreman. And we had advice from my

21:17.679 --> 21:24.627
uncle, who was a rancher, to help him. I would work 
at the ranch every summer. We moved out there. You

21:32.125 --> 21:34.188
were staying in Miracle, so you'd go to school? Go 
to school, that's right. So I would have a decent

21:35.329 --> 21:37.772
education. My mother was a graduate of 
Hardin-Simmons, so she appreciated an education

21:39.314 --> 21:50.147
and desired that we all have one. As a brother, we 
all did get degrees. That was good for me in lots of

21:55.859 --> 22:06.412
respects and made a very serious upbringing for a 
boy. I don't think I had to act as kind of her right

22:06.492 --> 22:12.940
hand. And also, I miss all the summer activities 
that kids have in town, like bicycling, swimming,

22:13.281 --> 22:22.913
things like that. But I think it was good 
education.

22:33.796 --> 22:43.046
So when you,

22:33.796 --> 22:43.046
this goes, when you go off to school, your brother 
had decided he wants to be a rancher. That seems to

22:43.727 --> 22:44.548
be the way. We both went to Tech. I was there a year 
before he came. He was two years younger.

22:53.116 --> 22:54.979
It just wasn't for him. He was never, didn't make 
excellent grades. He was as sharp as a tack, but he

22:58.284 --> 23:03.912
just didn't go to school. And he married early, and 
it was a natural thing to go to the ranch. Did he stay

23:11.443 --> 23:12.525
with the ranch? Yes. He died when he was 51. We all 
have heart problems, seriously, I mean. His wife

23:20.285 --> 23:23.248
is running the ranch right now. Is that right? 
Yeah. So we leased our property to her, and she runs

23:25.270 --> 23:29.715
it that way.

23:37.102 --> 23:47.052
I was the second president of the Tarrant County 
Veterinary Medical Association here, and a

23:37.102 --> 23:47.052
classmate of mine was the first president. Who was 
that? Oh, gosh, you remember? That's all right.

23:56.727 --> 23:57.849
I'm sure I've got that. I think I've probably got 
that. Out of Houston. I think I've got that in

24:00.993 --> 24:02.615
Tarrant. The Tarrant County history are a little 
off. Anyway, what was the attitude of people? When

24:10.304 --> 24:15.891
you started in practice here, I would imagine Fort 
Worth would be really strongly supportive of

24:10.304 --> 24:15.891
veterinary medicine. period and don't 
understand it pretty much. Not particularly.

24:19.779 --> 24:28.129
They had had an association for a very short time, 
maybe two or three years way back. And then my

24:28.609 --> 24:33.015
classmates, I think five of us, came here. And we 
just decided that we needed one. And my wife

24:38.040 --> 24:44.528
decided to try and organize the women. And she got 
the damnedest bawling out and reading down you

24:44.947 --> 24:51.997
ever saw from one of the older veterinarians' 
wives. Not much older, but it ended up this gal was

24:52.017 --> 24:59.849
the third wife's veterinary president. She 
switched her tune and came in. But

25:03.014 --> 25:07.420
that's another story. But

25:07.941 --> 25:13.249
I think you had one of the better state I was 
president of it twice. We ran down and we decided

25:19.763 --> 25:28.114
for about three or four years we'd re-run some 
presidents and get it going again. Do you happen to

25:29.075 --> 25:37.586
remember when you were first served as president 
and when you were last president what the number of

25:29.075 --> 25:37.586
members were? Or how many practitioners there 
were?

25:43.807 --> 25:45.429
15 years difference there. I know the first 
meeting I met in the hospital, the organizational

25:47.472 --> 26:01.450
meeting, and I would say it was 15, 20 members.

26:04.815 --> 26:11.704
And

26:04.815 --> 26:11.704
I was supposed to give some of this to Dr. Farrell's 
wife, she was doing the write-ups of Tarrant

26:13.287 --> 26:19.977
County information. I have a different file on it, 
but I didn't bring it today. I'll get that from you

26:22.901 --> 26:25.785
later, Farrell. Yeah.

26:30.092 --> 26:34.598
I missed something back there I wanted to tell you. 
With the ranch? Yeah, I've got that time. My wife

26:38.664 --> 26:42.670
and I were both presidents of the TVMA. at the same 
time. And that was in 62.

26:56.100 --> 26:59.543
And that was the first time that happened.

27:03.146 --> 27:07.971
Let me give you a little bit of TVMA stuff. Yeah, I 
sure do. These are extra coffees. You're welcome

27:10.933 --> 27:11.914
to them. And all of them deal with my time except 
that top one. And it tells, one article in there

27:16.850 --> 27:22.678
tells about Dan being elected the national 
president. National office. Good. Yeah, I

27:23.158 --> 27:24.020
appreciate that. You want these back? No, I have 
copies. All right. Thank you. I have one or two.

27:30.087 --> 27:31.750
Yeah, that's really handy. One or two that I don't 
want to give up. No, no, don't do that. Let me start

27:35.855 --> 27:37.117
back this again. That's great.

27:45.526 --> 27:50.937
I had one real controversial thing happen when I 
was president. We'll talk about it at last. And you

27:53.964 --> 27:59.856
might just mention the names or what names. It 
doesn't matter. It's over and the man's dead on

28:01.860 --> 28:06.049
that.

28:17.707 --> 28:25.114
My regime, we started the first seminars being 
held out in the state. OK. It's a continuing

28:27.216 --> 28:28.838
education program. The first one was held in 
Arlington.

28:34.804 --> 28:35.585
Why did you do that? What was the situation? Well, 
we felt the need for it that other than

28:36.526 --> 28:45.975
the state convention and the seminar It was held in 
June at College Station, where the only

28:46.732 --> 28:57.742
educational, continuing education, 
particularly that of the veterinarian, could

28:46.732 --> 28:57.742
attend. And we figured that if you brought 
subjects that weren't approached at these

28:58.643 --> 29:16.519
meetings and made them so that veterinarians did 
not have to travel over 50, 60 miles, we would keep

28:58.643 --> 29:16.519
her. up to date and that's been a very big bug with 
me. I am one of the early people in Texas in the

29:23.770 --> 29:40.482
American Animal Hospital Association and that's 
our theme is continuing education and keeping up

29:23.770 --> 29:40.482
to date.

29:41.170 --> 29:49.464
Now, were the state conventions seen or used at all 
as a mechanism for being informed, do you think,

29:41.170 --> 29:49.464
before this time? Oh, yeah. They had programs, 
yeah. This is a

29:52.629 --> 29:58.959
program. Of course, it had a lot of my friends in it. 
These are the conventions. I can loan you this. No,

30:07.468 --> 30:09.710
I've got those in Austin. Don't give me anything 
that you don't have. Oh, here's the problem. It's

30:13.474 --> 30:15.316
quite educational. But it was relied on as a 
mechanism for trying to maintain some degree of

30:16.437 --> 30:23.204
the room. And it moved from Fort Worth, Dallas, 
Houston, and San Antonio primarily. It was real

30:30.131 --> 30:32.473
unusual to go anywhere else. And when was the 
state, I interviewed Charlie Huff, when was the

30:35.245 --> 30:40.371
state offices moved to Austin? Right here. Okay. 
That's what I was thinking. No, wait a minute. We

30:47.059 --> 30:48.821
may have moved just in Austin. Yeah, because 
that's okay. I was just trying to associate it with

30:52.746 --> 30:56.951
your involvement, if there was any association. 
Now, who was the executive secretary, I guess, of

30:57.211 --> 31:02.798
the association when you were When I was, it was 
King from Dallas. He was a, Paul King, he was a CPR

31:08.533 --> 31:16.461
man. Was hired three years earlier, two years 
earlier, at an Abilene convention.

31:33.592 --> 31:39.718
Glenn Savage succeeded him during my regime.

31:44.643 --> 32:01.860
Glenn Savage, we advertised in the

31:44.643 --> 32:01.860
four main newspapers, San Antonio, Houston, 
well, Austin, too. for an executive secretary and

32:02.583 --> 32:06.006
told them what we wanted. And the board of 
directors interviewed 53 persons in Austin. And

32:17.436 --> 32:22.761
you don't need to put this in if you want to. It's an 
interesting thing. We had had a brother of a

32:25.744 --> 32:29.707
governor apply. A fellow had run for the Attorney 
General Lopi, a PR man that had been a San Antonio

32:33.734 --> 33:02.323
for years, PR man from Denver,

32:33.734 --> 33:02.323
and Glenn Savage, who was executive secretary for 
ICCRD,

32:33.734 --> 33:02.323
representing

32:33.734 --> 33:02.323
from Wichita Falls. At that time? He was the 
executive secretary, Akard, Akard, I-K-A-R-D.

33:04.097 --> 33:24.700
Well, funny thing, he called me up at about 10, 11 
o'clock on the last Sunday that we were

33:04.097 --> 33:24.700
interviewing and said he'd only heard about it. We 
didn't have any paper on him, you know,

33:25.761 --> 33:30.166
background, history, anything. But he sounded so 
good that I... told him, come on down, and we'd

33:34.147 --> 33:36.449
interview him. And I took it on myself. And at 3.30 
or so in the afternoon, he was bailing hay at the

33:39.272 --> 33:45.317
time. And he left out, came on down. And he was so 
much what we wanted that he sold himself on us. And

33:57.749 --> 34:03.074
he had a tremendous opposition in the people we had 
interviewed. Very good people. Well, let me ask,

34:05.062 --> 34:09.308
what were you looking for, and was there a special 
need you had? We wanted somebody that, it sounds

34:09.328 --> 34:17.401
silly, but could write letters, get us good 
publicity. We felt that his background there was

34:19.243 --> 34:22.108
very good. Hackard was head of the oil committees 
and very successful in the national

34:24.571 --> 34:33.685
representative in the House. uh and he uh didn't 
know boots about veterinary medicine but he was

34:34.373 --> 35:01.832
very interested in it he had a partial farm 
background uh i would say it was his uh his

34:34.373 --> 35:01.832
education and his uh employment that caused us to 
hire him and enthusiasm he was uh and he was uh an

34:34.373 --> 35:01.832
executive secretary for About five years, 
approximately. He went out when the

35:07.544 --> 35:13.352
Valley came in.

35:18.018 --> 35:21.222
He was not in Norton's regime. But he really did a 
lot for our association. What did he do? And again,

35:28.731 --> 35:31.475
what did you want him to do? Well, for one thing, we 
were under the state sales tax. And he and Bob

35:39.744 --> 35:53.783
Dillons up in the managed, excuse me, Bob

35:39.744 --> 35:53.783
were the main. He was very active in .

36:06.157 --> 36:13.947
Jones, Bob Jones, in getting veterinarians out 
from under the sales tax. We had it for about two

36:13.967 --> 36:16.010
years. And most veterinarians had to pay it, but 
didn't charge for it. So we were absorbing it

36:22.419 --> 36:24.321
ourselves. And I give Bob Jones, who was our 
legislative chairman, that credit. Second

36:36.059 --> 36:44.370
thing, we increased the

36:36.059 --> 36:44.370
membership greatly. I don't have that figure. 
How'd you do that? Well, it was hard going. Did you

36:51.278 --> 36:52.940
sell it at school? At school we didn't get 
anywhere. We tried to, but most of the members, our

36:54.963 --> 36:59.669
teachers wouldn't even be members. I've heard 
that's no problem. The anatomy teacher there is

37:02.132 --> 37:03.754
one. that talked me down to the very, he said, well, 
he wasn't even, didn't even take the state board.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.711
He wasn't licensed in Texas. A bunch of them, by the 
way. They were hard heads. And Jones, you can give

37:14.996 --> 37:22.828
him credit for breaking that barrier. I talked to 
Al Price, who was my classmate, became dean at a San

37:23.088 --> 37:32.222
Antonio meeting. And I said, Al, it doesn't look 
very good when less than 50% of the faculty, and it

37:33.299 --> 37:46.933
was quite a bit less, about 30,000, can't be 
members of your state association. And during my

37:48.034 --> 38:03.070
regime or the next one, I believe it was the next 
one, there came up a deal where they were raising

37:48.034 --> 38:03.070
salaries all over Texas

38:03.809 --> 38:05.871
university people. And A&M would not have gotten 
raises had not our profession been all out. And I

38:14.561 --> 38:16.544
told Al that. And he went back and made changes. He 
didn't issue an edict, but it was damn close to an

38:20.188 --> 38:25.133
edict. And I don't know if there's nothing else you 
might That's something those people still need to

38:29.577 --> 38:32.039
be reminded of. You know that? It's amazing how 
faculty just can't get in their minds. My first

38:36.884 --> 38:41.609
article there is that, is trying to tell 
veterinarians what we did for them. And faculty

38:42.530 --> 38:45.813
just can't get in their minds that they have 
obligations. The military, the same way. They, a

38:48.035 --> 38:51.398
lot, we had very few military members. But they 
need to be a member of the local association and the

38:51.418 --> 38:58.285
state because, besides the national one, But

38:59.362 --> 39:06.312
we instigated seminars. That was another thing. 
Let me see. Sales tax.

39:16.005 --> 39:28.643
Oh, we broke the Dallas-Fort Worth-Houston 
routine and sent the convention to

39:29.534 --> 39:31.296
I think in Monterey. The Valley. Just a minute. I 
had our first one there in quite a while. The Valley

39:41.346 --> 39:50.215
had a very good veterinary group and had been 
asking and asking and asking to have an

39:41.346 --> 39:50.215
association. This thing happened at Amarillo and 
El Paso in later years. and the Corpus Christi one,

39:57.260 --> 40:07.190
but those are about the only times it's missed the 
big city, but for the state convention. I missed

40:07.210 --> 40:07.530
it. Brownville. Brownville, yes. Every 
association goes through it, and Texas goes

40:09.692 --> 40:11.994
through it. You bet. Probably. AHA and AVMA go 
through the same thing. Yeah. I'm sure you've got

40:19.121 --> 40:22.144
to see that over and over. We had a liaison with the 
Texas Pharmacy

40:27.398 --> 40:38.392
group,

40:27.398 --> 40:38.392
just as we were. The TVMA, they were there. They 
were pharmaceutical and worked out a lot of drug

40:40.054 --> 40:54.933
problems

40:40.054 --> 40:54.933
or drug reviews sold in pharmacies. They really 
had veneer labels. And that was one thing we

40:57.672 --> 41:03.058
started, and it ensued through the years. But it 
was the first thing that resonated there.

41:11.587 --> 41:15.171
Where did Savage go when he left to get your man? He 
became a manager and partial owner for a

41:15.191 --> 41:24.321
veterinary sales group that Bob Jones headed. And 
it was up in the South Plains for about three, four

41:25.229 --> 41:30.654
years. And then he bought out our farm, Lone Star, 
got their supply here in Fort Worth. So he's still

41:38.541 --> 41:39.442
in there? In that, yes. But I

41:41.284 --> 41:50.653
thought that our hiring might make a good little 
side story. Yeah, that is. Here's Dan. You have

41:55.081 --> 41:56.222
this book. Yeah.

42:05.130 --> 42:08.373
And it also brings that new office. And that's in 
the book there, too. Good. So in your practice,

42:14.419 --> 42:23.687
let's go back to your practice now.

42:24.241 --> 42:30.807
You start out with a hospital, you go to your 
hospital, and you're still doing a mixed

42:24.241 --> 42:30.807
practice, basically. Yes, for a few years. I would 
say five to seven years, something like that, I was

42:32.909 --> 42:42.018
in mixed practice. And then what happened? Well, 
primarily the dairies and horse, people that had

42:43.219 --> 42:51.227
horses and stuff were zoned out to a radius of over 
10 miles, and it was inconvenient to leave an

42:52.135 --> 43:03.688
office full of people and go out and make a large 
animal call.

43:06.651 --> 43:12.878
The economics were not good, and the sentiment in 
the hospital was not good. Even if you had two

43:14.560 --> 43:20.607
people in the hospital, which I did pretty early,

43:22.578 --> 43:25.501
It still wasn't a paying thing.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.985
Most of them may fall this way. It's the economics 
of it. Sure. You can't leave a steady income where

43:33.628 --> 43:40.234
you got your investment to go out on a $10, $15 horse 
call. Now, were the small animal clients

43:40.474 --> 43:46.799
intruding on you anyway? In other words, they're 
coming? No. I set up to... I learned in Longview

43:52.396 --> 43:58.305
that they were there and they were ready to come to 
anybody. I

43:58.386 --> 44:15.012
learned a lot there and I learned in working for 
this veteran in Dallas what a good hospital it was.

44:15.616 --> 44:21.005
When you were in school, did you have any kind of 
specifications for what went into an animal

44:15.616 --> 44:21.005
hospital? No. After I got out, AVMA, AAHA, 
American Animal Hospital Association,

44:22.247 --> 44:35.249
published a small book on it, and that's the first 
thing. Then they got the sponsoring hospital of

44:35.269 --> 44:39.075
the month, which in their publication showed his 
hospital plan, how he financed it, and his

44:39.376 --> 44:47.185
building. And it became several firms in the 
United States, three or four, that had more

44:47.866 --> 44:56.676
knowledge than all the others. And they came to the 
forefront and improved hospital design.

45:02.883 --> 45:08.269
American Animal Hospital bears the burden of 
teaching that the schools did not. And while in

45:11.073 --> 45:17.602
school, I visited as many hospitals as I could and 
drew their floor plans. And I have built one, two,

45:18.643 --> 45:34.425
three, four hospitals

45:18.643 --> 45:34.425
and bought one other one. Were you operating them 
all at one time? No, I operated those in partial

45:37.983 --> 45:44.929
business with four of them. Partnerships. But

45:47.832 --> 45:53.918
I think that I've been through greatly. Each plan 
was better than the previous one. And also, I built

45:58.503 --> 46:03.147
mine to be able to build onto tried to build the 
others that way that the additions would not ruin

46:04.105 --> 46:11.672
the looks of it and ruin the efficiency of it. And 
that's a hard thing to accomplish. Yeah, yeah. Now

46:16.936 --> 46:24.223
when you move into your, more and more into small 
animal, did you finally make a decision that

46:16.936 --> 46:24.223
that's the way you're going to go? Yes, 
definitely. Yeah, I sold all my instruments or

46:27.606 --> 46:31.189
gave them away. I made One call about three or four 
years later, a good friend of mine, when we'd go out

46:33.856 --> 46:48.135
and check a horse for a Christmas wedding, a good 
old gentle horse, and it was in December, of

46:33.856 --> 46:48.135
course, and pretty frosty.
