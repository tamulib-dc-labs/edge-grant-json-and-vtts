WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:10.897
When he survives and comes back, the board 
recreated the system administration. Do you have

00:12.339 --> 00:17.827
any idea how that idea came back? Was that a board 
idea or do you have any idea? Well, I think

00:23.095 --> 00:28.603
basically was that at that point in time,

00:33.848 --> 00:38.934
They wanted to separate the presidency of Texas 
A&M University from the chancellorship.

00:41.937 --> 00:52.869
And

00:41.937 --> 00:52.869
that particular concept, there was a going about 
of, well, we need an agricultural man. And who do we

00:55.292 --> 00:58.455
want to get this agricultural man with? Who, all 
right, who was pushing that idea? Was that a board?

01:02.864 --> 01:04.307
That was sort of out there. Probably the board 
picked it up. There was certain people that

01:07.954 --> 01:13.485
thought maybe we needed an agricultural person to 
take the thing at the university. Yeah. Because it

01:14.006 --> 01:15.930
was an agricultural institution. We'd had 
liberal arts people and namely a history man like

01:18.635 --> 01:23.604
Jack Williams. And so

01:25.306 --> 01:31.577
that's essentially was the decision in which it 
went. All right, as the board is getting ready for

01:32.419 --> 01:40.272
the meeting where they're going to decide who the 
new president is going to be, Were you aware of any

01:41.686 --> 01:53.284
kind of plan for who might be that new president in 
1977?

01:53.564 --> 01:54.887
77, yes indeed. How were you aware of it? Well, 
people told you. I was on the opposite side. Okay.

02:02.997 --> 02:07.542
As a matter of fact, they were going down and 
picking a person that was reporting to me. And I

02:08.604 --> 02:15.231
knew that and I knew the political situations and I 
could see the actions going across the hall. As far

02:16.232 --> 02:20.818
as you're aware, did he pick them or did they pick 
him? Ty Timm was at the heart of all of us. I did not

02:27.788 --> 02:28.730
know that. This is the chairman of, I mean the 
department head of agricultural economics.

02:31.955 --> 02:32.837
Agricultural economics. They said, well, we want 
to have somebody in agriculture, and of course the

02:33.378 --> 02:38.908
best person that we can get in agriculture is an 
agricultural economist. This was Ty Timm. And Ty

02:42.013 --> 02:47.463
Timm thought, well, who do we have that we can push 
forward in this situation? Well, Carver's name

02:47.523 --> 02:51.670
came up.

02:52.173 --> 03:20.577
at that point in time there was designated 
contacts that were made at that at a group meeting

02:52.173 --> 03:20.577
and I am at that it was Shipley's Donut Shop

02:52.173 --> 03:20.577
and Bob Cherry had one Pat Wooten had some contacts 
to be made and and so it went well Reagan Brown was

02:52.173 --> 03:20.577
there and he went to see the governor

02:52.173 --> 03:20.577
and governor calls The chairman of the board would 
say, I think you ought to consider strongly. Now,

03:28.211 --> 03:29.392
who was the governor then? Was this Mark White? No, 
this was Dolph Briscoe. Was it Briscoe still? No.

03:38.841 --> 03:44.867
And how far ahead of time did you hear about this, 
this plan? Well, I knew that, I don't know whether

03:45.247 --> 03:50.192
it was planned, but I think it was worked out at the 
board meeting. I think that the pressure was

03:51.269 --> 04:04.226
building and enough and I knew at it because 
frankly Jarvis walked in and asked me to support

03:51.269 --> 04:04.226
him and I hemmed and hawed and that was my end of 
friendship with Jarvis for a long time. Because

04:06.269 --> 04:09.894
this is a note to the typist, you can include this. I 
heard about this plan and the way I heard about it

04:10.795 --> 04:19.487
was that various members of Jarvis Miller's staff 
were assigned to make phone calls and make

04:20.497 --> 04:32.331
contacts and then to check back and see had 
so-and-so spoken to this one or that one, which

04:20.497 --> 04:32.331
board members were in agreement and which ones 
were not yet. And I then called a friend that I asked

04:33.373 --> 04:44.226
him to never reveal my name and I would never reveal 
his, but he was a close friend of John Lindsay. one

04:45.083 --> 04:51.190
of our outstanding former students in Houston, 
and I knew that John Lindsay was very close to Dr.

04:45.083 --> 04:51.190
Williams. And I didn't think Dr. Williams knew 
about this plan. And so two or three days after I

04:57.397 --> 05:07.929
called this anonymous friend, he called me back 
and told me that he had passed this information on

04:57.397 --> 05:07.929
to Lindsay. Lindsay had passed it on to President 
Williams, and Williams had told him that whomever

05:08.550 --> 05:14.517
this person was They didn't know what they were 
talking about because he was the one to make the

05:14.783 --> 05:27.494
recommendation as to who the new president would 
be to the Board of Regents, and that Jarvis

05:14.783 --> 05:27.494
Miller's name had not even been mentioned. A week 
later, just before the board meeting, I got a

05:27.514 --> 05:38.123
second call from this anonymous friend in which 
Williams had called John Lindsay back and said,

05:27.514 --> 05:38.123
I'm being overwhelmed. Phone calls, letters, 
telegrams, and everything else. My arm is being

05:42.327 --> 05:44.689
broken at the socket. What was the general 
reaction as far as you were aware in agriculture on

05:45.412 --> 05:53.262
campus and off campus? I think general reaction, 
at least to start with, was good acceptance.

06:01.854 --> 06:09.023
And when Jarvis came in, did he attempt to change 
anything in agriculture? Well, yes. I mean, he

06:10.496 --> 06:28.474
attempted to change the structure because at the 
time the Jarvis came in, I was the Experiment

06:10.496 --> 06:28.474
Station Director reported to me, the Extension 
Director reported to me, and he was going to take

06:10.496 --> 06:28.474
those out and put those into vice presidents, 
namely Perry Atkinson, and then he picked an

06:10.496 --> 06:28.474
associate vice president, namely O.D. Butler, 
who he thought would be able to handle the

06:28.494 --> 06:36.242
extension pieces of this kind of thing. And they 
would report directly to him? And they would

06:39.507 --> 06:42.070
report directly to him. Around you as the dean? 
Around me as the dean, and I would report to the

06:44.752 --> 06:55.081
regular dean, the academic approach, because he 
had, Mac Prescott was named academic vice

06:44.752 --> 06:55.081
president shortly thereafter. Let's back up. 
While Cal, under Dr. Williams, John C. Calhoun had

06:57.344 --> 07:03.549
been vice president for academic affairs. 
Describe what it was like to be a dean reporting to

07:05.855 --> 07:07.397
Dr. Calhoun? It was an interesting kind of a thing. 
Dr. Calhoun was generally

07:11.222 --> 07:22.658
straightforward and accepted, and we could 
discuss things, but occasionally he would blow

07:11.222 --> 07:22.658
his top. Just a second, let me be sure that I didn't 
turn this thing. He would lose his temper, I should

07:27.064 --> 07:28.926
say. Calhoun did? Yeah. Oh, let's see. I never saw 
that. Go ahead. And he would come down on you, but

07:34.913 --> 07:44.065
almost immediately thereafter, it was a matter 
forgotten, and the issues began. Work was the

07:45.407 --> 07:47.189
thing, so you could work with the fellow. During 
those, Calhoun... I had a lot of confidence in John

07:51.515 --> 07:53.698
Calhoun. During those Calhoun-Williams years, 
who were your favorite, I'm not going to ask you the

07:55.045 --> 08:06.956
negative, who were your favorite dean 
colleagues, the ones that were best to work with?

08:12.981 --> 08:14.282
I'm not sure I had a favorite. Meaning you liked 
them all? I generally liked them all. I mean, we got

08:19.006 --> 08:20.067
along all right. Although sometimes the votes in 
those days used to be 10 to 1. Do you remember any

08:25.538 --> 08:30.913
important idea you had that Calhoun didn't 
accept?

08:34.583 --> 08:35.526
Calhoun and Williams? Not really. They had some 
ideas that I wouldn't accept. And it passed on.

08:44.608 --> 08:45.088
Such as? Well, that we didn't need all these 
animals, as far as this is concerned. We could use

08:50.797 --> 08:59.971
artificial types of things and animals, using the 
petroleum engineering as a model in his own mind.

09:00.752 --> 09:04.658
Were we making real progress in those years, the 
Rudder-Williams years? Oh, yes.

09:09.700 --> 09:19.436
In hindsight, how well prepared for the job was 
Williams for A&M at the time he was here?

09:22.801 --> 09:28.310
Dr. Williams

09:22.801 --> 09:28.310
was the man for the time. I sure feel that way. He was 
the man. John Calhoun was the man for the time. And I

09:38.843 --> 09:54.321
didn't feel pushback or anything of a sort 
relative to the, relative

09:38.843 --> 09:54.321
to working with either one of the two. And I had more 
difficulty with Jarvis Miller because obviously

09:56.630 --> 10:08.309
I was, I didn't generally consider him as 
presidential material. Maybe you ought not put

10:09.872 --> 10:11.975
that in. As far as you know, what was the process 
Jarvis used to select the new vice president of

10:12.275 --> 10:21.130
academic affairs? He listened to me. Did he? Okay. 
All right. Did he call and ask advice? No, I

10:26.801 --> 10:29.905
volunteered it. Oh, okay. All right. And the 
reason why I volunteered it is that I wanted a

10:30.886 --> 10:34.251
friend in that office. Oh, okay. All right. All 
right. Who else did you think might have been

10:36.234 --> 10:38.697
selected? I don't know. I really didn't question 
it at all. Okay. Because, you see, Mack was

10:44.686 --> 10:47.450
president, was dean of science. He would be well 
accepted. He was well accepted on the campus and

10:50.074 --> 10:52.557
things. Did Jarvis give you and or Mac give you 
deans any directions of what to do or not to do?

11:03.798 --> 11:11.048
Occasionally we'd get small pieces of advice and 
most of it would be policy discussions and this

11:03.798 --> 11:11.048
kind of a thing. But did things continue to 
function pretty well? I thought they functioned a

11:14.853 --> 11:21.042
lot better than I thought they would because at 
that point in time I My profile became much lower

11:22.473 --> 11:24.916
than it had been.

11:28.639 --> 11:31.703
Alright, and the reorganizational change did 
occur. It occurred. It occurred. And am I correct

11:35.767 --> 11:47.299
that those, the two directors, Experiment 
Station and Extension Service, in fact though,

11:35.767 --> 11:47.299
instead of reporting to Jarvis, ended up 
reporting to the system, didn't they? That was

11:51.449 --> 12:00.859
after a time, and I'm not quite sure I understand 
what process went through along this particular

11:51.449 --> 12:00.859
line. But they,

12:01.720 --> 12:14.873
whether it was because Clyde Freeman was in the 
system office and there was a growing tagging,

12:15.173 --> 12:23.627
there was growing friction between Jarvis Miller 
and Frank Hubert. After, after Dr. Williams.

12:27.594 --> 12:38.211
Yeah, and that, that Frank Hubert went up and 
suggested the rearrangement, and so Atkinson and

12:38.917 --> 12:45.570
Butler, instead of being vice presidents, became 
vice chancellors and reported directly to the

12:38.917 --> 12:45.570
chancellor. And essentially that is the 
structure that is, which we've inherited so far.

12:53.085 --> 12:58.596
The major change happened in 1988.

13:00.517 --> 13:11.633
when Charles Arntzen came in as Deputy 
Chancellor, or whatever they called him, of

13:00.517 --> 13:11.633
Agriculture, and he became Dean at that point. 
When I retired as Dean, and he picked up the Dean's

13:12.074 --> 13:27.216
title, he had the Directorship title, and only a 
couple of years ago, or years ago, Hyler has picked

13:12.074 --> 13:27.216
up the Extension Director title.

13:30.149 --> 13:49.525
When those two administrative units were 
separated out of your authority under Dr. Miller,

13:30.149 --> 13:49.525
was it more difficult then to get the

13:30.149 --> 13:49.525
regular task of agriculture accomplished? Yes, I 
think so, because you had to deal with other people

13:50.703 --> 13:54.549
and had to convince other people. In the early 
days, there were certain things that O.D. Butler

14:02.461 --> 14:09.271
had on his agenda, and he was able to work with Perry 
Atchison to get those into the play. And I didn't

14:10.153 --> 14:15.040
particularly agree with that approach at all. And 
so the only thing is that I just took it to a point and

14:15.475 --> 14:21.861
dropped the matter.

14:24.724 --> 14:32.352
And usually sometime later, it fell my duty to 
clean up the mess. Were you and other deans aware of

14:33.493 --> 14:40.059
Dr. Miller's approaching problems with the 
board? Yes, I was. Because I had, I was called aside

14:43.285 --> 14:50.736
by Frank Hubert. In advance? In advance. Are you at 
liberty to say how far? Days? Hours? It was a month

14:57.346 --> 14:58.107
or so. Oh, okay. Okay. See, the fundamental issue 
as far as I was able to determine was that

15:10.403 --> 15:19.374
In the utilization of funding, historically, 
there has always been amount of the available fund

15:10.403 --> 15:19.374
made available into the budget of the university. 
And presidents like Rudder and Williams always

15:21.376 --> 15:27.944
turned a lot of that back. But Jarvis and Mac 
Prescott decided, well, it had been

15:29.546 --> 15:37.155
appropriated. They were going to spend it. And 
this, of course, horrified Clyde Freeman, as it

15:39.817 --> 15:51.672
never had been before, because it was always been a 
working gentleman's agreement that that money

15:39.817 --> 15:51.672
would come back and do this kind of thing. So they 
began to press Jarvis to stop spending this money.

15:56.918 --> 15:58.901
And Jarvis simply said no. He had the authority, 
and he proceeded to go ahead and do it.

16:07.559 --> 16:11.830
And so I think that was at the heart. There may have 
been other aspects that were at the heart of the

16:11.850 --> 16:14.517
situation. But

16:15.620 --> 16:22.497
I was called in by the chancellor. Well, actually, 
I wasn't called in. The legislature was going on at

16:25.098 --> 16:31.866
that particular point, and there was a hearing on 
the real estate center. And the chancellor was

16:33.568 --> 16:37.693
there, and he said, what am I going to do? I said, I 
don't know. I said, you need somebody that Jarvis

16:40.056 --> 16:49.547
appreciates and to move the, to get him to work with 
you. because when I was, when he reported to me, I

16:49.747 --> 17:00.962
didn't, I normally just took things over and said, 
okay, you do it, and he did it.

17:00.982 --> 17:07.510
And I think there may have been some feeling as far 
as this is concerned. All right, then the official

17:09.893 --> 17:19.045
action to terminate Dr. Miller as president 
occurred in the in June of 1980. It was 1980. I was I

17:28.980 --> 17:30.803
was in Mexico at the time. How'd you hear about it? 
The secretary called. He got me on the phone and

17:36.615 --> 17:43.007
told me about it. Were, so, and the appointment of 
Chuck Sampson, were you and other deans surprised

17:44.742 --> 17:53.076
at Chuck's appointment? I was, yes.

17:58.806 --> 17:59.848
Chuck, I heard that. The, did, did Dr. Sampson, 
when you got back from Mexico, was there any change

18:01.270 --> 18:10.125
in the, None whatsoever, except that Sampson 
asked me to come up and explain the program that I

18:10.932 --> 18:19.445
was in, where my goals were, and things of this 
sort. All right, and then after about a year,

18:21.608 --> 18:27.918
Vandiver is selected. How did he introduce 
himself to you and the other key administrators on

18:28.799 --> 18:38.053
the campus?

18:39.367 --> 18:40.688
Let's see, what was it? There was a problem that 
existed shortly after

18:40.708 --> 18:50.378
he became president. And there was, I don't 
recall, and the whole faculty met. And that was

18:58.006 --> 19:00.909
essentially the first time I'd heard of Vandiver. 
How did he do with the whole faculty? Well, he

19:03.612 --> 19:06.775
offered to resign. And the faculty, almost 
unanimously, came up and started, you know, some

19:07.413 --> 19:14.921
of us said, well, what's going on here? And so one or 
two people start standing up and said, we're for

19:15.542 --> 19:18.725
you. And then so they sort of had the crowd. So that 
was the end of that situation. But I don't recall

19:23.010 --> 19:26.954
the details of the problem. Did you take him, did he 
travel around to see all the centers? He traveled

19:32.060 --> 19:33.561
around to see the centers. He and I had, I enjoyed 
working with him. particularly in certain

19:38.176 --> 19:46.146
international situations that we got and we 
resolved some international programs together.

19:46.166 --> 19:58.142
We had a problem that occurred in Saudi Arabia

19:46.166 --> 19:58.142
and I I finally just decided I was going to, they 
came in and talked to me, and I just finally just

19:59.101 --> 20:12.742
went in to President Vandiver and said, look, just 
make me chair in charge of this particular program

19:59.101 --> 20:12.742
until I can get it settled. And he did, and then he 
immediately went to Saudi Arabia and shook hands

20:13.363 --> 20:20.794
with those people, and everything was settled.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.184
Dr. Prescott was the Vice President of Academic 
Affairs. and during those Miller and early

20:27.485 --> 20:35.494
Vandiver years and so I'm assuming that he 
understood agriculture well. He understood it a

20:36.595 --> 20:39.879
lot better and he was he was clearly a friend. And 
then who follows him? Who's after after Mack who is

20:46.966 --> 20:49.629
the next? I don't recall. And you're dean until 88? 
I'm dean until February 29, 1988.

21:02.233 --> 21:12.584
During those years,

21:02.233 --> 21:12.584
do you feel that we would have made more progress if 
the old administrative structure had still been

21:02.233 --> 21:12.584
in place? Of the same academic person being 
responsible for the college, the... station and

21:23.746 --> 21:26.611
the service?

21:30.598 --> 21:31.560
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know.

21:35.506 --> 21:37.610
I did the best I could under the circumstances. I 
had a great deal to do with hiring faculty and

21:38.452 --> 21:44.041
appointment of heads of departments and things of 
this sort. So as far as the college itself is

21:44.763 --> 21:47.307
concerned, in the college during those years 
particularly, who are some of the, as you look

21:48.215 --> 21:56.583
back, who are some of the greatest appointments 
you are proud to claim? Well, I was glad to appoint

21:58.225 --> 22:01.548
Perry Atkinson as head of department. I know the 
answers to this, but why? Why would you be proud of

22:07.194 --> 22:08.736
Perry Atkinson? Well, he was a man who knew both the 
practical and the science.

22:16.345 --> 22:18.227
Was he congenial to work with? Yes, he was. We 
worked together. Fact is, almost a day after I was

22:25.836 --> 22:35.388
appointed, in fact, the day before I became 
appointed, it was announced, and that wasn't even

22:25.836 --> 22:35.388
the place. I went down to South Texas, and we fought 
a battle down there together. We fought many

22:39.052 --> 22:44.479
battles together, because seemingly 
entomologists always invented a new problem.

22:46.805 --> 23:13.656
uh because Perry a truly outstanding researcher 
am I correct in that yes but also up to the time he was

22:46.805 --> 23:13.656
uh doing his research when he went into 
administration he lost his yeah and he came back it

22:46.805 --> 23:13.656
was uh but at the same time he seemed to me to be 
realistic is that right you have to say that you

22:46.805 --> 23:13.656
have to say that I think the only thing I regret as 
far as his chancellorship was concerned is that he

23:14.885 --> 23:24.723
up and left it.

23:25.244 --> 23:30.033
And as a matter of fact, he left Dean Charlie Arnson 
up high and dry. What about other key appointments

23:32.258 --> 23:37.888
that you're proud of to look back on? Well, I think 
Gene Sanders was one of them. What was his

23:40.405 --> 23:41.646
department? His biochemistry, biophysics at 
that particular point, was one because he made a

23:41.846 --> 23:49.496
change that I wanted to make, and that's kind of a 
thing. Zerl Carpenter was a good man, but he didn't

23:51.438 --> 23:57.425
last long because they took him and made him 
director of the Extension Service. And Zerl was in

23:59.968 --> 24:02.151
what department? He was in animal science. Animal 
science. Did he follow OD? He followed OD. Let's go

24:08.108 --> 24:09.971
back and describe O.D. Butler as a department 
head. His manner and style, strengths,

24:12.495 --> 24:17.322
weaknesses, if he had any. O.D. Butler had a wealth 
of ideas. And what he needed most was somebody to

24:22.250 --> 24:27.357
filter them.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.579
Was there ever such a person? There was. Who? Me. 
Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, as dean. As dean, yeah, yeah.

24:35.969 --> 24:39.534
And he would carry on and we worked together. We put 
this, essentially made the movement together to

24:39.574 --> 24:44.060
put this building in place. And

24:45.863 --> 24:52.532
he had, it was, I admired him as far as this was 
concerned. And he was a strong-willed leader of

24:58.008 --> 25:00.471
the department wasn't he? He was a strong-willed 
leader

25:00.491 --> 25:22.841
he did some things that I don't think were very good 
things to do but

25:00.491 --> 25:22.841
he his problem was fundamentally he was a 
strong-willed leader he was a charismatic leader

25:00.491 --> 25:22.841
in a way but O.D. Butler principal problem was that 
he experienced In other words, his academic

25:27.961 --> 25:34.092
experience was largely A&M and a year or two at 
Michigan State. And as a result, his vision

25:35.014 --> 25:45.733
of what could be in terms of a larger major 
university was somewhat smaller than So, all

25:47.367 --> 25:56.160
right, then describe what would be the ideal 
experience for a key leader at a school like Texas

25:47.367 --> 25:56.160
A&M. Where should they have been? I

25:58.063 --> 26:12.184
think they need to be at one of the major land-grant 
universities.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.067
Bowen came from Oklahoma State, fine.

26:16.915 --> 26:36.016
And I would name those universities as being 
Cornell, Rutgers, Penn State,

26:16.915 --> 26:36.016
Virginia Tech, Florida,

26:16.915 --> 26:36.016
maybe Wisconsin. Wisconsin's problem is their 
undergraduate program.

26:41.902 --> 26:45.606
Their graduate program is superb.

26:50.733 --> 26:51.394
Cal Davis.

27:00.332 --> 27:00.813
Minnesota.

27:04.902 --> 27:05.583
Michigan State? I meant to mention Michigan 
State, yeah. I did not mean to leave them out. I

27:11.337 --> 27:15.824
think Iowa State has moved a great deal forward. 
For a long while they were falling back pretty

27:17.687 --> 27:19.990
heavily. I don't know about Illinois.

27:28.583 --> 27:29.484
I don't know about Purdue.

27:32.328 --> 27:34.712
Do you think in terms of say agriculture, I'm 
thinking in terms yeah basically but nonetheless

27:35.047 --> 27:43.459
I'm thinking in terms of the land-grant concept. 
Do you think Texas A&M has a chance in year 2020 to be

27:43.760 --> 27:51.791
one of the top 10 public institutions? Oh I expect 
so public yes top 10 is a pretty large number

27:59.583 --> 28:08.933
Because I think that Florida, NC State, Arizona, 
and Washington among the publics are now making

27:59.583 --> 28:08.933
real progress. University of Washington, not 
Washington State. No, no, not Washington State.

28:12.817 --> 28:18.263
That they are really moving upward as publics, as 
we are moving upward. But then to be in the top ten,

28:19.043 --> 28:22.307
then you've got to crowd some of those others out. 
Yeah, that's going to be difficult to do. We're

28:25.469 --> 28:33.979
talking about other key appointments that you're 
proud to remember and key associates during your

28:25.469 --> 28:33.979
deaning years. I guess I don't... I have trouble 
remembering names. What about some faculty hires

28:39.146 --> 28:51.281
that you...

28:39.146 --> 28:51.281
Did we go get any true all-stars? Yeah, we got some 
all-stars.

28:55.945 --> 28:57.527
Let's see, where's the catalog here? I'll try 
that.

29:06.959 --> 29:16.912
I think we have...

29:16.952 --> 29:18.274
I was trying to think of the name.

29:31.028 --> 29:35.500
Did anyone ever try to get you to add any programs 
that we didn't do at all? Most of those were some of

29:36.763 --> 29:39.350
my own invention. Such as? Undergraduate degrees 
in genetics, degrees in nutrition.

29:53.033 --> 29:53.895
What is the name? I'm having trouble remembering 
it. Max Summers is the one I was thinking of. What's

29:59.967 --> 30:01.009
his specialty? Etymology. We hired him cheaply 
from the University of Texas. Perry hired him. He

30:10.868 --> 30:14.535
came in and, of course, he's a member of the 
National Academy now.

30:18.312 --> 30:26.186
See, I have a theory that the way to really attract 
national attention quickly is to hire a few stars.

30:27.689 --> 30:30.233
But he wasn't a star when he came here. But he was 
about to be, wasn't he? Wasn't he about to be?

30:33.139 --> 30:34.301
Wasn't he clearly on the way? I think he was on the 
way up, but as I said, we hired him rather

30:34.321 --> 30:38.648
inexpensively. And of course, he's come along 
since that particular point in time. Now, during

30:44.755 --> 30:49.902
those years, you were dean for how many years? 
Twenty years. I was acting dean from September 1,

30:52.385 --> 31:01.518
67 to

30:52.385 --> 31:01.518
February 28. So were you the longest serving dean 
in modern times at A&M? In agriculture. Or any

31:10.831 --> 31:11.412
other? Who else served longer than 20? Well, Kyle. 
Oh, okay. Some of the early ones. Yeah, but in the

31:16.600 --> 31:21.465
last 40, 50 years, has anybody been a dean for 20 
years? 21, 20 and a half years. During the time when

31:24.188 --> 31:28.372
you were dean, what was your normal workday 
routine? What time did you get up and get to the

31:29.573 --> 31:31.415
office? I got to the office generally about 8.30.

31:37.501 --> 31:40.585
I was never here at 8, never in the office at 8. And 
what was...
