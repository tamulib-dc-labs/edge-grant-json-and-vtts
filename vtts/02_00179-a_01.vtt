00:16.240 --> 00:19.385
This is the 27th of March. We're at 2909 Coronado. 
And I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with

00:22.689 --> 00:27.055
James Ray. And you are now Jim or James? I go by Jim 
now. Jim. All right, class of? 63. 63. To introduce

00:35.923 --> 00:50.422
yourself to this tape and to anyone that would 
listen to it or read the transcription, describe

00:35.923 --> 00:50.422
family background, where you grew up, what did mom 
and dad do, where did you go to high school? Okay,

00:52.485 --> 00:58.253
I'll start with my mom because she also had a 
brother who was an Aggie. And then my dad, who was an

00:58.402 --> 01:14.783
Aggie, my mom was born in Royce City, Texas, and 
when she was very young, she moved to Rockwall,

00:58.402 --> 01:14.783
where her father was the county sheriff, and he had 
been the city marshal in Royce City. He became the

01:15.705 --> 01:23.875
sheriff of Rockwall County, which is the smallest 
county in the state, northeast of Houston, out

01:15.705 --> 01:23.875
beyond Garland. I'm sorry, northeast of Dallas, 
out beyond Garland. And

01:29.013 --> 01:51.932
that's where she grew up and when she was a teenager 
her mother died and then a few years later her

01:29.013 --> 01:51.932
father got ill and became incapacitated and so she 
moved to Longview to live with her mom's sister and

01:29.013 --> 01:51.932
it was there that she met my dad. My mom's maiden 
name was Norma Macklin M-A-C-L-I-N and my father

01:52.351 --> 02:02.887
was Leonard Franklin Ray. He was born in Longview 
as I was and he met mom at a church social at the First

02:03.929 --> 02:17.650
Baptist Church in Longview and They married, and 
then I was born in 1941, went through elementary

02:18.845 --> 02:41.919
school at Judson Grove Independent School 
District, which is now a part of the Longview

02:18.845 --> 02:41.919
School District, and I went there through the 
seventh grade, and in the summer of 1954, we moved

02:18.845 --> 02:41.919
to Conroe. At Judson, my dad had been the 
vocational ag teacher In Conroe, he taught high

02:48.562 --> 03:00.079
school biology and

02:48.562 --> 03:00.079
my mom still lives in Conroe. My dad passed away in 
1992 and I came to Texas A&M from Conroe High School

03:00.159 --> 03:12.757
in September of 1959. My dad was the class of 1938, 
my mom's brother started to A&M in the early 40s,

03:19.291 --> 03:35.859
then he went off to war, went off to Europe, and then 
he came back and finished, I believe, I believe

03:19.291 --> 03:35.859
he's listed, his class year's listed as 47 or 48. 
He's Robert Edwin Macklin, Jr., named after their

03:36.019 --> 03:41.127
dad. Why did you attend A&M? Well, with Uncle Bob 
and my dad both being Aggies, I didn't know there

03:44.992 --> 03:54.104
was any other place. No, I had heard a lot about it. 
And I guess when I was a kid growing up, I remember on

03:57.869 --> 04:06.981
Saturday afternoons when we'd be out. This is back 
in the late 40s and early 50s. you know, we'd be out

04:11.806 --> 04:38.809
doing chores, sometimes, you know, washing the 
car or detailing, cleaning it up, and the car radio

04:11.806 --> 04:38.809
would be on, and I remember Kern Tips doing the 
Southwest Conference play-by-play for, back

04:11.806 --> 04:38.809
then, I guess it was Humble Oil and Refining 
Company, and hearing a lot about the the games and

04:39.920 --> 05:05.067
the different players and I was very active in 
athletics as a youngster, played football,

04:39.920 --> 05:05.067
basketball and baseball and I didn't have any idea 
whether or not I'd ever be a competitive

04:39.920 --> 05:05.067
collegiate athlete or not but A&M was always one of 
my favorites. Did you come to visit A&M before you

05:05.705 --> 05:09.469
came up to? I did. My dad brought me over here and we 
visited with a cousin, Joe Dark, who was in one of

05:13.333 --> 05:35.577
the cadet corps dorms and we went up to see him and I 
don't remember, I remember that visit

05:13.333 --> 05:35.577
but I was kind of almost somewhere between neutral 
and maybe slightly negatively impressed with the

05:36.333 --> 05:59.296
dorms because they were so stark and austere just 
concrete and of course that was way back in the days

05:36.333 --> 05:59.296
before that they'd done all the renovations that 
was probably sometime in the in the early to mid

05:36.333 --> 05:59.296
50s. Did you and your buddies at high school talk 
about colleges and schools? Oh yeah, as a matter of

06:04.768 --> 06:09.433
fact, several of the guys had nicknamed me Aggie.

06:12.337 --> 06:17.282
So did you ever seriously think about going 
anywhere else? Not really. When a buddy and I went

06:18.183 --> 06:32.580
to take the, it wasn't the SATs, back then it was 
called the college board exams, we took them on the

06:18.183 --> 06:32.580
Rice campus. And because there were three places 
that they would send the test scores at no

06:33.370 --> 06:44.965
additional cost, I had mine sent to Texas A&M, 
Baylor, and Rice. And never

06:46.127 --> 06:53.937
heard from Baylor or Rice. Of course, I just sent 
the test scores, never sent an application when I

06:53.977 --> 07:00.626
sent the application to Texas A&M. And then... 
went over to check and see if it was satisfactory

07:03.931 --> 07:11.299
and make sure the application had been accepted. 
They had already indicated that if I wanted to come

07:11.319 --> 07:17.686
I was acceptable academically. You got here in the 
fall of 59. That's correct. Did you go to fish camp?

07:27.977 --> 07:31.942
I don't believe I went to fish camp that year. I went 
to fish camp as a counselor I believe in my junior

07:34.070 --> 07:53.222
and senior years but I don't believe I was one and 
I'm not really sure how folks were selected back

07:34.070 --> 07:53.222
then or whether you had to volunteer for it and I 
really wasn't that familiar with it. So when you

07:53.242 --> 07:58.370
came to enroll it was to begin classes. Describe 
that trip over mom and dad brought you in the car,

08:01.255 --> 08:04.400
and what did you bring with you, and so forth. Gee, 
that made such a, I don't remember the trip over. I

08:14.054 --> 08:16.237
don't remember what I brought with me. Did you have 
a footlocker yet?

08:22.466 --> 08:25.390
Probably so, either a footlocker or some kind of a 
suitcase. It might have just been a few packing

08:26.592 --> 08:29.997
boxes. to move in a few things but I probably 
traveled pretty lightly anyway knowing that

08:30.314 --> 09:00.034
there would be uniforms to wear and so I probably 
just had maybe some Sunday clothes to wear to

08:30.314 --> 09:00.034
church if that was permitted and I didn't even know 
and not very many civilian clothes and so just some

08:30.314 --> 09:00.034
basics and Did mom and dad give you any advice or 
direction as you were getting ready for them to go

09:00.605 --> 09:07.456
home?

09:11.983 --> 09:12.844
Not that I recall. I

09:14.547 --> 09:28.468
don't have much of a remembrance until the

09:29.815 --> 09:50.373
the initial meeting, the first, I guess I got there 
on a day, the sophomores must have been in a meeting

09:29.815 --> 09:50.373
somewhere when I arrived because it seemed like it 
was either a junior or a senior,

09:29.815 --> 09:50.373
kind of welcomed me and got me in a room and told me 
when the first fish meeting was gonna be. How did

09:51.715 --> 09:55.998
you get, you and your outfit, how did that pair up? 
How did you get assigned an outfit? I really don't

09:57.895 --> 09:58.777
know. When I got there and checked in, they told me I 
was going to be in Squadron 9 because I had

09:59.297 --> 10:10.597
requested an Air Force as opposed to an Army unit. 
Even then, I knew I wanted to apply for pilot

10:12.099 --> 10:17.108
training. Where was Squadron 9? It was located in 
dorm 12. I believe that's called Ute Hall, if I'm

10:22.528 --> 10:26.773
not mistaken. It was right adjacent to Duncan 
Dining Hall, so it was the most southerly of the

10:27.273 --> 10:39.025
dorms. And of course, we were... Did that outfit 
have a nickname? It was called Hellcat 9. and our

10:46.782 --> 10:49.686
group still refers to it. In fact, although we were 
always Hellcat 9, it was an outfit that had just

10:49.706 --> 11:08.976
been reconstituted or created from seems like 
Squadron 5 and

11:09.597 --> 11:11.999
I can't remember where the leadership cadre came. 
I know some of them came from squadron five and it

11:12.019 --> 11:24.430
was one I guess that had been had been enacted for a 
while because of the fluctuation in the student

11:12.019 --> 11:24.430
population. Anyway they reactivated it that year 
and we had had new leadership. So there's a senior

11:30.635 --> 11:34.399
or junior who takes you to your room? As I recall 
That's the way it was and it was pretty pleasant the

11:38.572 --> 11:56.874
first, I'd say the first half of the first day 
because I remember getting in my room and having a

11:38.572 --> 11:56.874
chance to get pretty well established in the room 
before the first fish meeting and the first

11:38.572 --> 11:56.874
sophomores came in. Describe that room. It was a 
little,

12:00.198 --> 12:07.026
let me see. When you open the door and there's a 
very, a fairly narrow hallway into

12:08.828 --> 12:21.039
a single room. When you close the door, then you 
made room for the two closet doors to open from on

12:21.740 --> 12:27.064
either side of you. And then on one side of the room 
was a metal iron bunk bed, double bunk. And that was

12:38.782 --> 12:41.385
on the right hand side. On the left hand side was a 
lavatory and a mirror. Trying to remember if there

12:48.774 --> 12:50.917
were two of those or just one. I guess you and your 
fish buddy, your fish old lady had to share those as

12:52.419 --> 12:58.807
I recall. I'm just trying to visualize it. And then 
just beyond the the bunk in the corner there was a

13:05.714 --> 13:33.025
single window in the middle of the room and on 
either side of the window with the backs to the

13:05.714 --> 13:33.025
walls were the two study desks and so if you were 
both studying at the same time you sat back to back

13:05.714 --> 13:33.025
and then above the study desk was one or two shelves 
where you put your study books. It was pretty

13:33.626 --> 13:35.468
austere, it was concrete There was waxed 
concrete, if you can imagine that. Fourth floor?

13:43.130 --> 13:44.972
No, I was on the first floor. How did you get that? 
Well, there were two squadrons there, and

13:48.595 --> 13:56.823
Squadron 10 was up above us. They had the third and 
fourth floors, and Squadron 9 was on the first and

13:57.243 --> 14:05.151
second floors, and they had us interspersed. with 
all the other upperclassmen. I know right

14:10.193 --> 14:13.538
opposite us were two sophomores. To our right were 
two sophomores. To our left were two juniors. When

14:19.706 --> 14:25.694
you arrived, did you know much Aggie lingo and 
traditions and all that? Not really. Of course, I

14:28.117 --> 14:35.627
knew the spirit of Aggieland and the Aggie war hymn 
just from having attended a few football games

14:28.117 --> 14:35.627
with my dad and and some friends but didn't know all 
of the lingo that you learned. Did you know what to

14:41.913 --> 14:45.137
expect those first few days and nights?

14:48.300 --> 14:49.702
Not really. I think my dad had kind of dropped some 
hints that it would be military but that didn't

14:50.443 --> 15:04.298
bother me and really I was not as put off by a lot of 
the early regimentation as some folks were. In

15:09.518 --> 15:15.548
fact, we had a couple of guys in our outfit that 
didn't last more than a day or two. And in fact, one

15:16.009 --> 15:25.223
of my buddies from Conroe, I won't mention his 
name, but he came and was in an army unit and he was

15:16.009 --> 15:25.223
there maybe three or four weeks. And I remember my 
dad calling me one time saying that he and Mr.

15:25.895 --> 15:37.751
So-and-so were coming over to visit him and try to 
see what the problem was. And the problem was he

15:37.891 --> 15:49.927
just didn't like the regimentation and the

15:37.891 --> 15:49.927
toughening process. And so I think he quit and went 
to Baylor. You said it was for a few hours it was

15:55.139 --> 16:00.766
pleasant and then here came the sophomores. 
Describe all of that routine. Well,

16:03.950 --> 16:24.015
they had a fish meeting and when we all fell out to go 
to the meeting, they lined us up on the second floor

16:03.950 --> 16:24.015
along the wall and We learned how to stand at 
attention and hit a brace, chin tucked in, lots of

16:25.075 --> 16:31.485
wrinkles and all of that. Although that part was 
conducted by the juniors and then the squadron

16:31.706 --> 16:51.117
commander who was

16:31.706 --> 16:51.117
John Lister came out and gave us a pep talk, and that 
was the first warning we had that the sophomores

16:52.717 --> 17:01.386
were going to be taking up our training. And there 
were a couple of sophomores present then, but it

17:02.387 --> 17:19.804
was mostly, it was the squadron, the commander and 
his executive officer, and then the first

17:02.387 --> 17:19.804
sergeant, Vernon Yotta, And they are the ones who 
gave us the first orientation. And the one or two

17:26.861 --> 17:34.093
sophomores that they had allowed at that first 
meeting were the ones that had been lining us up. I

17:35.695 --> 17:46.652
guess that was the last of what you might call 
instructive

17:47.138 --> 17:47.739
attitude. From that time on it was a demanding 
attitude. You know, you will do this, you will

17:51.583 --> 18:05.198
learn this, you will say, and it's when you learn to 
say yes sir, no sir, and sir not being informed to

17:51.583 --> 18:05.198
the highest degree of accuracy, I state to 
articulate in fear I may deviate from the true

17:51.583 --> 18:05.198
course of rectitude, in short term a very dumb 
fish, and do not know sir. I said that often enough

18:05.219 --> 18:09.543
that I still remember it. That's without any 
premeditated practice at all. It's just right off

18:13.148 --> 18:16.251
the top.

18:17.817 --> 18:20.160
When did you get your uniforms? That is not real 
clear. I remember you know going and having them

18:24.105 --> 18:27.970
issued. I would guess it was either that same day 
that afternoon. Where?

18:36.741 --> 18:45.512
There used to be a wooden building down behind dorm 
one which was the core headquarters, down at the

18:45.661 --> 18:56.720
end of the core quadrangle as you know where the new 
arches and all that entryway is now. Of course at

18:57.200 --> 19:08.800
that end is where dorm one on the east side and dorms 
two on the west side and then dorm one runs north and

18:57.200 --> 19:08.800
south and dorm two runs east and west and kind of 
offset from that on the street was a wooden

19:09.539 --> 19:36.424
building that housed a tailor shop and it was like a 
quartermaster actually it was an outlet for a

19:09.539 --> 19:36.424
cleaning and laundry service but on that occasion 
that was used as kind of the distribution point for

19:37.062 --> 19:38.424
a lot of the uniforms. Now that's where we went, all 
the Air Force people. I don't know if the other

19:41.809 --> 19:46.736
cadets from other places went other places or not, 
but that's where we went. That building also at

19:47.036 --> 19:50.181
that time housed the singing cadets. Well, I say it 
did. My memory's not clear whether that was my fish

19:53.987 --> 20:04.622
year or if that evolved during one of the 
subsequent years, but I know the singing cadets

19:53.987 --> 20:04.622
also occupied that building for a while. Your 
uniforms, were these new or were they used? They

20:08.786 --> 20:10.468
had been used before. I don't remember 
specifically. Occasionally guys would get some

20:15.335 --> 20:21.744
new ones, but a lot of them had been used before and 
were handed down. Did they fit well? Not at first.

20:25.710 --> 20:32.179
They tried to get fairly close, but I remember 
having to go over to Northgate to get them tailored

20:32.716 --> 20:43.735
especially after you put on the uniforms for the 
first time and that was probably either that

20:32.716 --> 20:43.735
evening or the next morning. You put the uniform on 
and then we fell out in formation and in addition to

20:44.496 --> 20:58.420
the drill and ceremonies there was a lot of 
critique about how you wear the uniform and how

20:59.058 --> 21:26.061
neat and how tight or loose and just a lot of 
critique to make the uniforms look right and the

20:59.058 --> 21:26.061
thing about that to me was I just assumed that 
everything that was happening even though it was a

20:59.058 --> 21:26.061
little harsh and a little strenuous at times I just 
figured that was normal for the military so I just

20:59.058 --> 21:26.061
adapted to it didn't complain about it and I 
figured it was you know when they He told me how to

21:26.918 --> 21:52.639
straighten your gig line and how to tuck your shirt 
tail in and even things like, especially when

21:26.918 --> 21:52.639
you're getting ready for a graded review or march 
by, how at a certain point all the guys kind of

21:26.918 --> 21:52.639
turned inward, unzipped their fly, reached in, 
pulled the shirt tails down to tighten them With

21:53.024 --> 22:12.410
your belt buckles tightened so the shirts would 
stay down and there wouldn't be any creases or

21:53.024 --> 22:12.410
wrinkles around your middle, you'd reach in and 
pull your shirt tails down and then zip your fly up

21:53.024 --> 22:12.410
and everybody turned back in formation as a little 
technique for getting a little bit better grade

21:53.024 --> 22:12.410
when you did your graded march-bys. That's the 
first time I'd ever had that happen. And it made an

22:16.155 --> 22:22.103
impression, but at the same time, I understood why 
and I went along with it. When did your official

22:22.859 --> 22:24.881
lady arrive?

22:27.725 --> 22:29.186
Probably that same afternoon. Earl Henderson was 
my official lady from Houston. He was Houston

22:34.092 --> 22:35.514
Spring Branch. Did you all become fast friends? We 
did. We got along very well that year. Although the

22:44.784 --> 22:52.393
second year,

22:54.128 --> 23:00.975
Because his major and my major were different, we 
got other roommates. We were just together the

23:00.995 --> 23:02.817
first year. And the first semester, we lived in 
dorm 12. And then there was some kind of a

23:07.763 --> 23:13.209
renovation project. And I don't remember what 
they did,

23:20.572 --> 23:50.275
it really didn't materially affect the rooms that 
much but there's some kind of renovation to the to

23:20.572 --> 23:50.275
the building itself and so our second freshman 
semester we moved over to the to dorm seven on the

23:20.572 --> 23:50.275
opposite side of the middle of the quadrangle on 
the opposite side and uh but same roommate same

23:20.572 --> 23:50.275
outfit yes and same routine same routine right 
Now,

23:50.626 --> 23:56.955
I presume there were two or three days before 
classes started. What all was done to whip you all

23:58.757 --> 24:07.108
into shape and to get you ready to be real members of 
the Corps? How did they do that? Well, I just

24:10.653 --> 24:17.342
remember spending a lot of time on the sidewalks 
and the quadrangle over there on the west side of

24:17.626 --> 24:46.536
Duncan between Duncan and dorm 12 and then and then 
marching out on the the wide concrete in front of

24:17.626 --> 24:46.536
Duncan dining hall and uh occasionally and and 
there were a lot of other outfits were out there and

24:17.626 --> 24:46.536
I remember the uh just learning how to march and 
step to a cadence and uh and Jody calls and uh and uh

24:48.490 --> 25:00.508
Every

24:48.490 --> 25:00.508
once in a while, if you messed up, a sophomore would 
take you out and give you some one-on-one drill and

24:48.490 --> 25:00.508
say, no, the other left. And teaching you how to 
keep your elbows straight and cup your hands and

25:03.132 --> 25:12.065
everything to look military when you marched. And 
to me, it was just something to learn. I didn't

25:17.768 --> 25:19.350
object to it. A lot of guys even the ones that stayed 
and made it all the way through complained a lot

25:19.791 --> 25:32.070
about how tough everything was and I just kind of 
shrugged it off and went along with it. Of course I

25:32.150 --> 25:42.966
got my share of chewing out so if I did a misstep or 
did a right face when everybody else did a left

25:32.150 --> 25:42.966
face. I just took it as a learning experience and 
went on of course I had been a competitive athlete

25:43.469 --> 26:13.273
so I was used to coaches you know sometimes I won't 
say yelling at you because that sometimes

25:43.469 --> 26:13.273
especially in modern day carries the wrong 
context but yeah there was a lot of yelling at you

25:43.469 --> 26:13.273
but I took it as being instructive and 
motivational and stressing the importance of you

25:43.469 --> 26:13.273
know if you screw up you make the outfit look bad and 
so I really never had any problem adapting to it. I

26:17.618 --> 26:41.995
never had any sense or thought of quitting or going 
home or complaining although there were a few

26:17.618 --> 26:41.995
times when some sophomores were leaning on us or 
some of our fish buddies so heavily that we

26:17.618 --> 26:41.995
retaliated and that was not only to me that was more 
good bull than it was extreme frustration but I was

26:42.565 --> 27:11.458
always adventurous enough that if somebody was 
being harassed and needed some help I'd usually

26:42.565 --> 27:11.458
try to try to help them out and like the times where 
we water ballooned the guys right across the hall

26:42.565 --> 27:11.458
from us and another time when we babble bombed 
another guy from another outfit who had been

26:42.565 --> 27:11.458
harassing the fish unmercifully in fact 
unreasonably describe the Babel bombing as y'all

27:12.333 --> 27:14.556
did? Well let me do the water balloon first because 
that one happened first and I think getting away

27:15.478 --> 27:39.032
with that one kind of gave us the courage to try the 
other one later but Tommy Dabney and Jack Mahan

27:15.478 --> 27:39.032
live right across the hall from us and

27:40.480 --> 27:47.287
I want to say Alton McGee and Grubby Heron were 
sophomores that lived to our right. Now our room,

27:48.468 --> 27:53.353
our window faced Duncan. So we were on the east side 
of the dorm and Tommy Dabney and Jack Mahan were on

27:53.674 --> 27:58.399
the west side right opposite us. And they had been 
leaning pretty heavily on some of the fish and some

27:59.179 --> 28:07.568
of the guys were really, really frustrated. So we 
decided, and they had gotten on our case harder

28:09.168 --> 28:17.821
than we thought was reasonable on several 
occasions. And so we decided, as a matter of fact,

28:17.881 --> 28:25.352
we went up to one of the juniors. His name is Billy 
Sewell from Waco. And we asked for kind of a timeout

28:28.677 --> 28:33.103
or an academic situation to complain. There were 
rules for, you know, venting grievances or

28:33.123 --> 28:38.972
requesting academic help or things like that. 
where you could relax a little more and talk more

28:39.880 --> 28:47.916
frankly than you could normally on a day to day 
basis. Billy Sewell had always seemed pretty

28:49.158 --> 28:56.893
reasonable and always had kind of a twinkle in his 
eye and yet he was sharp, he was gung ho. but we

28:57.262 --> 29:22.273
figured that he was one of the juniors we could 
trust so I went with someone else I don't remember

28:57.262 --> 29:22.273
who it was it was probably Earl and we asked him we 
told him the kind of behavior and irrational

28:57.262 --> 29:22.273
exuberance as Alan Greenspan would put it that 
they were experiencing and that

29:23.823 --> 29:40.988
we thought that was unreasonable and we asked if 
there was anything that the upperclassmen could

29:23.823 --> 29:40.988
do to rein that in and

29:23.823 --> 29:40.988
he kind of hemmed and hawed and well he was very

29:42.554 --> 30:03.060
candid with us but it was kind of evasive as to what 
upperclassmen could do to solve that and he said

29:42.554 --> 30:03.060
that's part of the system you kind of have to go 
along with it to the extent that it's reasonable

29:42.554 --> 30:03.060
even if they're a little out of line and so we 
reiterated that we thought some things were

30:04.019 --> 30:25.977
unreasonable and as we told him some of these 
things he kind of nodded didn't comment and we said

30:04.019 --> 30:25.977
uh well look if the uh if the upperclassmen can't do 
anything about it if we uh if we retaliated by babo

30:04.019 --> 30:25.977
bombing or water ballooning or or uh say putting 
chickens in their room on the weekend when they're

30:27.239 --> 30:55.373
going to be gone for a couple of days which we'd 
heard these stories around about how other fish

30:27.239 --> 30:55.373
getting frustrated had retaliated and we asked 
him you know if uh... if we would be in trouble or

30:27.239 --> 30:55.373
really bad trouble uh... you know to the point 
where we might get kicked out of the outfit or

30:27.239 --> 30:55.373
kicked out of school if we retaliated and got them 
to be and just sent them a signal that they were out

30:55.623 --> 30:59.027
of line. He thought about it for a minute, and all he 
said was, not if you don't get caught.

31:06.696 --> 31:13.484
And I guess he probably remembered his fish year 
and how frustrating sometimes things can get. So

31:13.524 --> 31:18.630
we took that as our signal to go, but don't get 
caught. So we picked the night. I don't remember if

31:22.595 --> 31:24.617
it was the same night or...
