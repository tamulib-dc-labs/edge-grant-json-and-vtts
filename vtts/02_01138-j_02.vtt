What? What are y'all doing? Then the little coat 
thought that the dog Spot might be his friend, but

00:05.291 --> 00:15.307
Spot saw another dog and ran to join him. Now you 
haven't been to school but a few years,

00:16.689 --> 00:27.186
kindergarten, head start, first grade and so on 
and so forth. I know that you've had all kinds and

00:28.432 --> 00:33.878
all different teachers. Have you ever had an old 
teacher? Yes, but not as one as old as you. Let's

00:40.987 --> 00:48.495
see, I had one in the first grade and the second 
grade that were pretty old. But none of them as old

00:48.515 --> 00:50.878
as you. Well, what's different with me than the 
teachers you have now? If you do something wrong,

00:57.887 --> 01:03.248
they'll fuss at you and keep on it. and then they'll 
show you what's right. But you, when you do

01:07.469 --> 01:11.874
something wrong, you just tell them the word and 
you keep on going. You don't fuss at them. Well, do

01:13.597 --> 01:15.459
you think fussing helps any? No. I don't either. 
But if you show a little boy two different words,

01:17.702 --> 01:27.995
and they're little words, little words make big 
words when they're put together, don't they? Yes.

01:28.916 --> 01:32.401
All right, didn't we pick out the little words so 
you could see them? Yes. Did that help you? Yes. And

01:37.545 --> 01:40.877
what do we call that? What did I say we did? We 
attacked it. It attacked it. And we hit it from

01:48.675 --> 01:50.917
every side, didn't we? Yes. We started at the 
front, and we picked out a little word. We came over

01:53.840 --> 02:00.006
here at the back and got a little word, and we got in 
the middle to see if we could find a little word. And

02:00.127 --> 02:01.448
then what did we do? We read the whole thing. We 
added them together, didn't we? And we got

02:07.895 --> 02:11.018
arithmetic lesson in that, didn't we? Sure did. We 
don't teach arithmetic by itself, do we? No. We

02:14.483 --> 02:16.586
teach it with our reading. Mm-hmm. We teach our 
science with our reading. Yeah. We teach

02:20.692 --> 02:22.575
everything together, don't we? That's right. And 
how long have you worked with this that we didn't

02:24.537 --> 02:30.626
even get up and stop? Two days. Two days is right, 
but we worked how many hours, you reckon? We

02:38.297 --> 02:39.739
haven't even stopped. One or two hours. We worked 
two flat hours that we didn't even stop one time.

02:46.181 --> 02:47.263
Thank you. You're welcome. What do you think about 
this sign up here? Old teachers never die. They

02:57.720 --> 02:59.422
just grade away. What do you think about that? I 
think that's neat. Thank you.
