00:03.473 --> 00:29.915
I asked him about this and

00:03.473 --> 00:29.915
he

00:03.473 --> 00:29.915
was in the ABMA and was editor of the American 
Veterinary Medical Association Journal. So he

00:29.935 --> 00:31.017
had been

00:36.464 --> 00:38.566
papers and so on. And I described to him what I 
wanted. And he said, well, I think you've

00:43.132 --> 00:50.060
described Red Mouth. I said, well, who is Red 
Mouth? And he told me. He was in the armed forces in

00:56.007 --> 00:58.670
Ireland. And he'd just about finished his tenure 
in the army. told him who he was and what he did, and I

01:06.046 --> 01:12.956
got to checking up on it, and yeah, I think that's 
the guy I want. And so then I got a hold of him and got

01:12.976 --> 01:24.412
him down here, and he stayed with it 10 years, and 
then he died, and he lived in Bryan.

01:25.434 --> 01:30.020
That gave us some stuff on research. How do you 
spell his name? M-A-U-R-E-R. well that's another

01:35.830 --> 02:05.820
related

01:35.830 --> 02:05.820
are there other people you would suggest we we go 
talk brett meyer would be a good one to talk to now

01:35.830 --> 02:05.820
he's 80 years old and he's uh kind of like kind of 
like i am i lose some names names are like your

01:35.830 --> 02:05.820
fingers you know you know them as well as your 
fingers but can't call them well one of the things i

01:35.830 --> 02:05.820
kind of wanted to do I don't know enough about it, 
but, you know, the military side, you know,

02:06.273 --> 02:13.850
there's been a lot of military posts here in Texas. 
There's been a lot of military activities here in

02:13.870 --> 02:16.737
Texas. And we used to run mule trains, the Army did, 
even the late 30s out to Toyville all the time. It

02:25.392 --> 02:28.015
may be just with a paragraph, I don't know. Do you 
remember a few years ago when Venezuela equine

02:28.556 --> 02:35.304
encephalitis came to Texas? Absolutely. Fred 
Maurer was monitoring that day by day by day. Well,

02:40.290 --> 02:44.034
first month by month, and then week by week, and 
finally day by day. And he kept telling the

02:44.434 --> 02:53.425
authorities of the feet, hey, this is going to come 
across that river. what are we going to do when it

02:54.046 --> 02:55.868
comes across that river? And they said, well, we 
can't do anything until it gets across the river.

03:00.675 --> 03:06.943
Unfortunately, the State Department couldn't do 
anything in Mexico. They didn't have an agreement

03:06.983 --> 03:08.785
in Mexico. So they couldn't do anything to stop it 
in Mexico. And Fred Meyer was trying to get them,

03:12.530 --> 03:17.717
well, look, let's go into Mexico and stop it down 
there. Don't let it get over here. I said, no, we

03:19.848 --> 03:21.230
can't do that. Because they did that with Hooker 
Mound, and they did that with, you know, they had

03:21.250 --> 03:31.743
Americans used to wander across the border all the 
time, rounding up stairs and inoculating

03:21.250 --> 03:31.743
animals. For rabies, we've done some of that. Fred 
Maurer, now, was the guy who was on top of that, and

03:35.027 --> 03:45.720
he was busy, busy, busy in the office downstairs 
during that time. he was not the one who made the

03:46.865 --> 03:53.892
vaccine, but he was instrumental in getting the 
vaccine made. And the Army had about 10,000 doses

03:54.673 --> 04:01.720
of vaccine or something like that. I don't 
remember the number, but a whole bunch of vaccine.

04:05.704 --> 04:13.772
And then when it came across the river and they 
began to have it in South Texas, well, they went in

04:05.704 --> 04:13.772
there with a mass vaccination. And that was a 
picture perfect containment of a disease. That's

04:19.715 --> 04:20.876
a good case, yeah. That's a good one. 
Picture-perfect containment. It did not let him

04:25.420 --> 04:29.224
get out of cases. That's good. And Fred Meyer is a 
guy that Ramrod, he didn't do all the work, but he's

04:31.066 --> 04:42.336
the guy that pushed it. Well, some of those kinds of 
stories that we're looking for that One of the

04:46.315 --> 04:52.761
things I think we'd kind of like to do, you know, the 
TVMA has its own political agenda, obviously. And

04:52.781 --> 05:03.751
one of the things they want to do, as I gather, is 
they want to share with high school students and

04:52.781 --> 05:03.751
everyone else an image of veterinary medicine 
which is positive, upbeat. And I think we all want

05:04.552 --> 05:07.034
to do that. But we need to have some kind of good, 
positive building. It needs to be an accurate

05:11.479 --> 05:16.103
presentation. Well, of course,

05:16.302 --> 05:31.066
what you've been charged with, I'm sure, is that it 
is a history of veterinary medicine in Texas. It's

05:31.767 --> 05:33.850
not a history of the Texas Veterinary Medicine. 
No, that's right. It's not a history of the College

05:34.551 --> 05:37.336
of Veterinary Medicine. No, that's right. It's a 
history of veterinary medicine in Texas. And

05:41.182 --> 05:42.985
that's the way it should be. accomplish the whole 
thing. Now there'll be a part of this and part of

05:44.864 --> 05:53.438
that in it, but he'll cover the whole bit as best he 
can. But it's something like this, you know, the

05:53.458 --> 06:04.336
story of Dr. Brown, you know, would be a 
significant... Yeah, that's what, maybe you, if

05:53.458 --> 06:04.336
you can follow up on him, that would be good. Is he 
still in good health? Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. As I

06:07.702 --> 06:08.263
said, he's Yeah, like all of us. I don't

06:10.714 --> 06:19.738
know how I got to be a historian, because I sure 
can't remember names and dates and places.
