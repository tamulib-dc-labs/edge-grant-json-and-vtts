00:05.043 --> 00:08.228
There

00:05.043 --> 00:08.228
we go. Okay, again, I would point to page 24 to an 
article entitled Galveston's Conflicting Power

00:08.248 --> 00:16.781
Groups by Ed Protz. Ed is the former grant 
coordinator for one of those powerful families.

00:21.267 --> 00:25.934
That's the Moody family, and he's written an 
article basically on the power groups.

00:30.742 --> 00:33.025
I would also... Draw your attention to page 28 in 
the same magazine to an article by Harris Kempner.

00:43.545 --> 00:47.711
Mr. Kempner is another member of one of those 
wealthy influential families. And his article is

00:48.733 --> 00:52.218
entitled The Win-Lose Character of an Island 
Economy. And he indicates that two major local

00:54.020 --> 01:03.214
issues illustrate how Galveston's economy is 
inextricably tied to its geography and

01:03.734 --> 01:06.076
foreshadow a third issue yet to come. So to find out 
what that third issue is, read the article.

01:12.143 --> 01:16.707
Obviously, there has been, I don't know about 
religious impact. Obviously, religion plays a

01:17.348 --> 01:21.892
large part. But as far as city planning goes, I 
wouldn't say it's not played a greater part, as has

01:22.433 --> 01:32.323
political or geographical influences. 
Obviously, geographical has been strong because

01:33.485 --> 01:38.730
Galveston's a barrier island. It's a harbor. 
That's been the primary trade since day one. Also

01:45.917 --> 02:02.614
because of that, this has been the landing place 
for many ethnic groups, Italians, Germans,

01:45.917 --> 02:02.614
Spanish-speaking cultures, just to name a 
couple.

02:05.733 --> 02:06.654
Sociological. Not sure I know what that means.

02:13.002 --> 02:13.522
Economic.

02:16.706 --> 02:21.212
Yeah, I think we touched on economics a little bit.

02:23.274 --> 02:34.508
The ports have always been a strong economic 
strength of the city.

02:34.640 --> 03:03.988
the other two which are normally mentioned as far 
as the strengths the second one which is growing

02:34.640 --> 03:03.988
very rapidly is the tourist industry and some have 
predicted that'll be the predominant economic

02:34.640 --> 03:03.988
strength in in the near future like within five 
years the third mainstay of of the local economy is

02:34.640 --> 03:03.988
the university of texas medical branch which 
employs a great deal of people and has been around

02:34.640 --> 03:03.988
for A long time, probably since the turn of the 
century.

03:12.578 --> 03:22.330
Military, there

03:12.578 --> 03:22.330
was an air base here during World War II, but I don't 
think that was a major influence. Although one of

03:23.612 --> 03:29.740
the issues today does involve the federal 
government. Because they do own a large chunk of

03:31.694 --> 03:43.626
land, over 700 acres to be exact, on the far eastern 
part of the island, north of the seawall, which is

03:31.694 --> 03:43.626
called the Fort Crockett spoils area. And that's 
where all the spoils go as far as the dredging,

03:44.687 --> 03:54.377
maintenance dredging, of the Houston Ship 
Channel, the Galveston Ship Channel, and

03:44.687 --> 03:54.377
Galveston Bay. The issue here is that the city, for 
years, probably 20 years ago, made efforts

04:00.449 --> 04:06.317
through Senator Jack Brooks, the Corps of 
Engineers, to have that land released to the city.

04:07.078 --> 04:10.843
Land is a very scarce commodity on a barrier 
island. And so we will be starting again very soon

04:11.244 --> 04:23.261
another effort to see if we can get those 700 acres 
released, probably for residential

04:11.244 --> 04:23.261
development, largely.

04:26.986 --> 04:28.448
What does this last thing mean?

04:34.857 --> 04:36.602
Is that just a note to you or what is that? I think 
that's more of a note to me. Okay. No, I think you've

04:38.568 --> 04:40.434
touched on everything. Okay. Okay. Well, I sure do 
thank you for your... Your information and your

04:45.843 --> 04:47.626
time. Good luck, and I hope Bob gets it done this 
year. Because we're not going to help him out

04:53.254 --> 04:59.003
financially

04:53.254 --> 04:59.003
anymore. And I was one of those who, I may not be his 
favorite person, but I said, after a while, you've

04:59.023 --> 05:05.333
got to produce something in order to get more 
money. But I like Bob, and we have our differences,

05:05.373 --> 05:14.247
but I wish him great success in this project.
