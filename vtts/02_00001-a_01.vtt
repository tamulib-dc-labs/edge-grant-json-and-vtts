WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:05.079
this machine and see if it's working.

00:05.099 --> 00:06.203
One, two, three, four.

00:06.785 --> 00:07.970
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:11.321 --> 00:14.091
This is Tuesday, December 5th, I believe.

00:14.830 --> 00:22.400
in the Engineering Physics Building interviewing Tom Adair, Chairman of Physics and longtime friend.

00:22.420 --> 00:32.654
To begin with, Tom, would you describe for this machine and anybody who may listen or read later your background and experience before you came to A&M?

00:32.674 --> 00:33.455
Where did you grow up?

00:33.575 --> 00:34.356
Where did you go to school?

00:34.376 --> 00:35.537
What did mom and dad do?

00:35.858 --> 00:37.480
Where did you get your PhD and so forth?

00:38.287 --> 00:42.217
I grew up in Houston, went to Stephen F. Austin High School.

00:43.260 --> 00:54.388
I lived out near Hobby Airport because my father was a pilot for an oil company.

00:56.090 --> 01:01.987
I finished high school and everybody was coming to A&M and that was my decision.

01:02.007 --> 01:04.193
So I came up here in 1953.

01:07.061 --> 01:11.112
My father always wanted me to study dentistry.

01:11.092 --> 01:13.175
That's what I was going to be, a dentist.

01:13.675 --> 01:17.601
And then sometime in high school, I decided I wanted to be a medical doctor.

01:19.263 --> 01:23.328
And before I graduated from high school, I decided I wanted to be an engineer.

01:24.229 --> 01:30.678
So I arrived at Texas A&M in 1953 as a young engineering student.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.340
I always tell my

01:32.320 --> 01:41.010
this story halfway through the semester, and that is that I had to take engineering drawing.

01:42.392 --> 01:53.485
Well, I lived on the campus theater side of campus, north side, and if you know where the flower garden is, across the street from the television station,

01:53.465 --> 01:57.550
That's where a building was that we had engineering drawing.

01:57.570 --> 02:04.537
So Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I had to get up and be across campus and in that class by 8 o'clock.

02:05.358 --> 02:09.743
I did not like engineering drawing for other reasons, too.

02:09.903 --> 02:13.848
So I found that if I'd switched to physics, I didn't have to take the second semester.

02:14.408 --> 02:17.912
So by the second semester, I was majoring in physics.

02:17.932 --> 02:19.133
I graduated in 57.

02:19.314 --> 02:23.218
I went to Rice and was there two years.

02:24.076 --> 02:27.423
Finished my master's summers while I was at Rice.

02:27.463 --> 02:32.935
I worked for Humboldt Oil and Refining Company at Production Research there in Houston.

02:34.037 --> 02:39.308
And then when I finished my master's, I went to work for them permanently.

02:39.328 --> 02:42.675
And got my master's degree, I might add, with Charles Squire.

02:44.005 --> 02:52.396
at Rice, and then after three years, when did I finish?

02:52.416 --> 03:12.882
In 59, yeah, three years in industry then, I also finished my military commitment while I was at Hummel, and then in 62, I decided to go back to school, and so I came, A&M offered me a fellowship, so I came to A&M for my PhD,

03:12.862 --> 03:20.810
And Charles Squire arrived at A&M in 1962, and so I arrived here in 62, and he was here.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.532
I got my PhD with him in 65.

03:22.812 --> 03:26.316
Were the, now, the arrival of you two, was that coincidental?

03:26.336 --> 03:28.238
Coincidental, yeah.

03:28.758 --> 03:34.664
But once I knew he was here, then I knew that I'd work with him for a PhD.

03:34.885 --> 03:35.946
And your specialty?

03:36.827 --> 03:37.908
In low temperature physics.

03:39.069 --> 03:40.270
And you finished when?

03:40.385 --> 03:48.379
I finished in 65, and then I took a postdoc year in the Netherlands.

03:48.399 --> 03:57.815
I worked for a year at Cameron Lone, his laboratory in Leiden, the Netherlands, and then came back to Texas A&M to look for a job.

03:59.338 --> 04:05.008
By then, Squire was head of the department, and he asked me to come back and spend a year.

04:05.798 --> 04:16.997
And while I was here, then I could, it's hard to look for a job over there, and I'd come back here and work a year with him as a young faculty member and then go off somewhere.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.284
That year was a very stormy year.

04:22.867 --> 04:23.388
What year was that?

04:23.849 --> 04:31.722
That would have been 1966, 67.

04:33.541 --> 04:42.615
Now what I'm having trouble remembering is if he were also the head 67, 68, I believe he was.

04:42.635 --> 04:51.208
So during that time, the physics faculty went to General Rudder and said, you got to get rid of this guy.

04:51.228 --> 04:59.481
And so surprisingly, I think, Rudder decided to get rid of him.

04:59.461 --> 05:07.889
So he was removed from his position as associate dean and as department head and made a distinguished professor.

05:09.150 --> 05:17.157
So his plan, at least as far as I could tell, his plan was to be a distinguished professor and do research and forget about administration.

05:18.078 --> 05:25.204
He did that for one year, and during that year he hired two other young faculty members.

05:25.224 --> 05:29.468
So there were three young fac—oh, I'm sorry, he hired—

05:29.448 --> 05:32.797
Yeah, he did.

05:32.857 --> 05:35.966
Jim Plough came in as a young assistant professor.

05:36.066 --> 05:37.450
I was a young assistant professor.

05:38.633 --> 05:44.489
And then the next year he made an offer to Don Noggle.

05:45.511 --> 05:45.752
Who?

05:45.850 --> 05:47.173
Don Noggle.

05:47.193 --> 05:48.956
Noggle was a- In a UGLE.

05:49.196 --> 05:49.437
Yes.

05:50.098 --> 05:56.571
And he was an undergraduate at Rice working some with Squire while I was a graduate student there.

05:56.751 --> 06:08.854
And then he went off to the Marine Corps for four years and then in 62 he was back to continue his education, decided to go to Texas A&M, not real sure why.

06:08.834 --> 06:19.536
And he, so he and I showed up here together in 62 and both worked for Squire and then both finished in 65 and both went to Europe for postdoc year.

06:20.377 --> 06:27.231
And then Naugle came back to the States at Maryland as a postdoc and then Squire brought him down here

06:27.211 --> 06:30.136
to begin it in 69.

06:31.098 --> 06:43.380
Well, before Noggle arrived, then Squire resigned and decided that he wanted out, so he resigned, and that left the two of us

06:43.360 --> 06:48.525
with nine graduate students, I think.

06:48.545 --> 06:52.709
And so we were very busy for, and I had most of them.

06:52.770 --> 06:54.912
Don had a couple of them, and I had the rest of them.

06:55.753 --> 06:59.657
And between the two of us, we finished up those graduate students over the next few years.

06:59.677 --> 07:02.519
And by then, I was stuck.

07:03.801 --> 07:08.065
So your first year as a faculty member was 60?

07:08.085 --> 07:08.986
66.

07:09.046 --> 07:10.988
66, 67.

07:11.103 --> 07:15.375
Do you remember what the beginning salary was?

07:15.395 --> 07:16.418
You asked me that the other day.

07:16.478 --> 07:21.332
I should have looked it up, but no, but I do happen to know that

07:21.937 --> 07:26.884
One of my friends was hired in 1969 at $1170 a month.

07:27.605 --> 07:31.770
So I want to say, I want to say $740 a month.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.494
I think $740 a month was my starting point.

07:34.614 --> 07:36.837
And it was a nine month or 12 month?

07:37.378 --> 07:38.219
Nine month appointment.

07:38.359 --> 07:39.581
Nine month appointment.

07:39.601 --> 07:46.631
Describe in those first two or three years, describe what your teaching responsibilities were.

07:47.392 --> 07:49.935
What courses, how many students and so forth.

07:49.915 --> 07:54.602
The teaching loads for physics have always been low.

07:55.543 --> 08:05.118
In fact, I have used your story about the old head of history who went off to President Sherman Hall?

08:07.061 --> 08:07.401
Ralph?

08:08.363 --> 08:08.984
Ralph Steen.

08:09.004 --> 08:09.404
Steen.

08:09.464 --> 08:10.466
Stephen F. Austin.

08:10.626 --> 08:12.008
I think his story was

08:13.456 --> 08:18.409
Someone went before the board, and I think this is your story, and they wanted to know, well, how many hours does he work?

08:18.489 --> 08:23.602
Well, he works, he works, I want you to know that he works 12 hours.

08:23.782 --> 08:25.727
Well, that's a good day's work in anybody's book.

08:25.748 --> 08:29.457
Was that your story?

08:29.437 --> 08:39.032
But the teaching load when I arrived on the faculty was one lecture and the recitations that go with it.

08:39.973 --> 08:49.167
And so I was in the classroom three hours a week for lecture and three to four hours a week for recitation.

08:49.147 --> 08:51.671
And what were the, what courses?

08:51.691 --> 08:56.378
I taught Physics 219, which is a second semester physics course for engineers.

08:57.319 --> 09:05.050
So these were, these were engineering students taking electromagnetism.

09:05.070 --> 09:12.201
Describe what it was like for you to prepare for those lectures first, the first semesters.

09:12.321 --> 09:15.566
Oh, you, you're asking me to really .

09:15.586 --> 09:18.630
I've, I don't remember a whole lot about it, but

09:18.948 --> 09:46.879
certainly it took a good bit of time to prepare the notes for the first time you're teaching and I did have an unusual situation and then when I finished my postdoc in the Netherlands I thought that I was coming back for postdoc year continuing postdoc year with Squire but when I arrived I was a he had brought me back as an assistant professor and so I was supposed to teach well he had been teaching my course because I didn't get back until

09:47.703 --> 09:48.864
first of October.

09:48.884 --> 09:50.106
So he was teaching my course.

09:50.146 --> 09:51.167
So I had to go in.

09:51.187 --> 09:55.412
The first lecture, I went in, and he lectured, and I sat in the back of the room.

09:55.432 --> 09:59.076
And then the next two lectures, I lectured, and he sat in the back of the room.

09:59.136 --> 10:01.538
And it was much nicer when he left.

10:01.558 --> 10:03.641
And I had the class myself.

10:04.482 --> 10:07.485
Normally in those years, how many students per section?

10:07.785 --> 10:13.071
Oh, I probably had 35, 35 or 40.

10:13.712 --> 10:16.495
And all engineers, all pre-engineers,

10:17.656 --> 10:22.562
All in the sophomore year of engineering, yes.

10:22.582 --> 10:26.206
I probably had more than 35 or 40, because they were broken into smaller groups.

10:26.647 --> 10:28.990
So I probably had 70 or 80.

10:30.451 --> 10:34.296
And this was in the physics building?

10:35.498 --> 10:36.379
Physics building.

10:36.699 --> 10:42.546
There were two rooms downstairs, you may remember, in the basement.

10:42.887 --> 10:44.929
Two very nice lecture rooms.

10:44.909 --> 10:48.555
All right, and then the, you said the recitation, what was that?

10:49.096 --> 10:58.933
That was the same students in smaller groups for problem-solving sessions, send them to the board and help them over hard spots in the problems, that sort of thing.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.876
What about lab?

11:00.856 --> 11:10.211
The labs were the responsibility of teaching assistants, though it's certainly under my supervision.

11:12.174 --> 11:15.900
I had taught the laboratories as a teaching assistant as a graduate student.

11:17.423 --> 11:26.357
When you began here, what were your, did you have some long-term dreams, aspirations, goals, self-appointed goals?

11:27.147 --> 11:33.797
When I arrived on the faculty in 1966, I certainly intended to go back into industry.

11:35.319 --> 11:42.329
I had not really given much thought to being a university professor.

11:42.349 --> 11:55.669
I had come out of industry and enjoyed my research in industry with the Humboldt Oil and Refining Company and had intended to go back and

11:58.231 --> 12:00.115
I don't, I think, I went down and visited.

12:00.155 --> 12:03.381
I don't remember if I went down and interviewed or not, but I went down and visited.

12:04.222 --> 12:13.821
But when I got tied up into the academic end here, working with Squire and young assistant professor in teaching, I liked it.

12:13.841 --> 12:21.235
And then when Squire left, I had too much responsibility for getting these students finished.

12:22.092 --> 12:30.380
to leave and then after they were all finished up, that's three or four years down the road and I was settled in and comfortable and enjoying life.

12:31.221 --> 12:34.004
Now, in those days we didn't have a tenure system.

12:34.024 --> 12:34.685
No.

12:34.705 --> 12:37.708
So that there wasn't any talk about being on the tenure track.

12:38.068 --> 12:39.529
No.

12:39.650 --> 12:52.082
Do you remember at the end of your first year or second year any kind of quality evaluation or did anybody, were you aware that somebody gave you some kind of measurement?

12:53.328 --> 12:54.590
No, no.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.533
I don't remember any evaluation.

12:57.374 --> 13:02.643
Salary increases, were they merit, as far as you knew, merit-based?

13:02.663 --> 13:04.105
As far as I knew.

13:04.125 --> 13:07.090
I never paid much attention.

13:07.270 --> 13:11.837
Describe the department in those first years.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.520
Who were the key people?

13:13.540 --> 13:21.192
Well, in 19, well, one of the reasons that Squire was brought back was to,

13:23.315 --> 13:26.079
write a proposal for the cyclotron.

13:26.099 --> 13:41.141
The Welch Foundation was interested in the cyclotron at Texas A&M, and A&M had a proposal that, done a white paper or something, but Squire wrote the proposal for the cyclotron that we now have.

13:41.361 --> 13:44.105
Well, the last generation cyclotron.

13:45.126 --> 13:46.909
And so,

13:46.889 --> 13:50.315
He was heavily involved in that.

13:50.335 --> 14:03.919
My participation in that I remember clearly, and that was that I was one of the two graduate students who carried the model of the cyclotron into the board meeting that Scar gave the presentation, but that was before I came back as faculty member.

14:03.899 --> 14:05.241
The in-board meeting?

14:05.481 --> 14:05.962
Yes.

14:05.982 --> 14:07.865
What was their reaction to the proposal?

14:08.025 --> 14:10.269
The only thing I know, I was not allowed to stay.

14:10.369 --> 14:11.951
I just carried the model in and left.

14:12.031 --> 14:20.244
But the thing Squire came out saying was, can you believe one of those people asked me why we needed a cyclotron when we already had a reactor?

14:23.569 --> 14:25.892
Now, this is in the early 60s.

14:26.012 --> 14:27.174
Yes.

14:27.194 --> 14:28.777
And Mr. Rutter is here.

14:29.378 --> 14:31.020
As far as you were aware,

14:31.523 --> 14:37.654
all the key people on the campus were very much for the Cyclotron.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.718
Yes, as far as I know.

14:40.018 --> 14:41.641
Of course, I was a young faculty member.

14:41.681 --> 14:46.009
I didn't, I wasn't involved in any of the, in very much.

14:46.430 --> 14:48.874
And I wasn't involved in many of the rumors.

14:49.495 --> 14:55.683
The proposal, by the time I came back on the faculty, the proposal had been funded.

14:55.703 --> 15:05.817
The Welch Foundation had put in a million dollars for the building, and we were moving towards building up a group, and we brought in some people.

15:05.857 --> 15:07.519
Some didn't stay very long.

15:07.799 --> 15:10.002
We brought in a fellow named Igo.

15:09.982 --> 15:13.206
A matter of months and then left.

15:13.427 --> 15:16.511
It must have been something political going on that I don't know anything about.

15:19.315 --> 15:26.664
Then we had my early years on the faculty were years that we were building up the faculty in nuclear physics.

15:27.385 --> 15:36.698
That's when we brought in a number of young faculty members working in atomic or in

15:36.678 --> 15:40.303
nuclear physics at the cyclotron.

15:41.165 --> 15:46.733
The cyclotron must have gone online in the late 60s, forgotten really, sometime in there.

15:48.856 --> 15:56.428
The director of the cyclotron in those days was the old vice president, Andy Sutton.

15:56.448 --> 15:59.833
And there was a lot of feuding going on

16:00.590 --> 16:05.777
in those days between the engineers and the scientists.

16:06.518 --> 16:18.394
Finally, they fired or they removed the director, the associate director of the cyclotron and put in the engineer, MacFarlane.

16:19.536 --> 16:21.559
There's a great story about MacFarlane.

16:21.579 --> 16:22.480
Did you know MacFarlane?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.313
Yes.

16:24.774 --> 16:29.585
Big, tall, good-looking guy, smoked a big cigar.

16:30.707 --> 16:37.262
Well, he and the chief engineer over there went up to accept the magnet for the cyclotron.

16:38.643 --> 16:41.667
some small company up east, I think.

16:41.687 --> 16:48.497
And they spent two days inspecting the magnets and there were some, a number of flaws.

16:49.378 --> 16:56.568
And so MacFarlane told the president of the company that he had to have a meeting because there were some problems.

16:56.588 --> 16:59.993
So he, the president of the company got all of the

17:01.340 --> 17:13.555
vice presidents and chief engineers, and they're all sitting around a big conference table, and McFarlane and our engineer, name I've forgotten, McFarlane stands up.

17:13.575 --> 17:14.597
He's smoking his cigar.

17:15.037 --> 17:15.898
He puts the cigar down.

17:15.918 --> 17:19.362
He said, gentlemen, I want you to know that this magnet is flawed.

17:19.382 --> 17:20.484
You're going to have to fix this.

17:20.644 --> 17:21.385
You're going to fix this.

17:21.405 --> 17:26.051
You're going to fix this before Texas A&M is going to consider accepting this magnet.

17:26.071 --> 17:31.077
He reached down, picked up the cigar, and put the wrong end in his mouth.

17:33.841 --> 17:38.805
So all of his cool was lost in one instant.

17:39.566 --> 17:44.350
Other key, who were the key veteran faculty members in physics?

17:44.471 --> 17:51.397
In physics, there were very few because there weren't many faculty members until the early 60s.

17:52.478 --> 17:55.180
But about how many were there?

17:55.200 --> 17:59.004
Oh, I don't know.

17:59.024 --> 18:00.825
I would guess 15, 20.

18:01.606 --> 18:03.848
I could be wrong.

18:03.828 --> 18:23.952
But the old-timers, the major ones, Jim Potter, who was department head all through my student days, and then he was removed at the time that the college was formed.

18:24.833 --> 18:28.738
Squire was brought in as associate dean under

18:28.718 --> 18:33.385
Frank Hubert, because he was Dean of Arts and Sciences.

18:33.405 --> 18:38.773
And about that time they split the college into several pieces.

18:39.153 --> 18:45.883
The College of Science was formed, brought in Zaner as dean, and Squire was associate dean to Zaner.

18:46.685 --> 18:51.672
And the year I was gone then, Zaner then removed

18:51.652 --> 18:56.679
put Potter as department head and put Squire in as department head.

18:56.699 --> 19:00.023
And that's the way it was when I came back.

19:00.043 --> 19:17.406
And by that time, some of the key faculty members, Melvin Eisner and Jack McIntyre, Jack came in 1963,

19:17.386 --> 19:22.693
And then Nelson Dollar came in 1962.

19:22.793 --> 19:34.727
Who were the teachers of the plain vanilla introductory courses?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.631
The, well, all of us really.

19:38.152 --> 19:38.432
Is that right?

19:38.452 --> 19:38.893
Yes.

19:38.913 --> 19:40.334
The masses of students took?

19:40.575 --> 19:41.576
Yes, yes, yes.

19:41.596 --> 19:46.482
But we had a number of the old timers still here, Ben Bariski.

19:46.462 --> 19:48.965
U-R-I-S-K-I-E?

19:49.205 --> 19:50.447
Yes, I think so, yes.

19:50.707 --> 20:11.052
But local fellow, he's grown up, he was a teenager on this campus, because in those days the faculty lived on campus, or faculty and staff, I don't know if his father was faculty, but they lived right there by the system building on campus, and actually they formed, his family formed

20:11.032 --> 20:15.417
the area where I live now, east of campus, the Rose Circle area, it was a farm.

20:15.798 --> 20:25.069
And his property that his family formed went to the fence just beyond my house now.

20:25.089 --> 20:28.874
And Ben died probably two years ago.

20:29.114 --> 20:33.900
But the faculty teaching

20:33.880 --> 20:46.429
the mass of students, Jack Hebert and Bob Kenefick, Nelson Duller, Don Noggle, Jack McIntyre, all of us.

20:46.449 --> 20:51.501
Were there in your student days any legendary physics teachers?

20:51.481 --> 20:54.185
Jim Potter was the main one, Jim Potter.

20:54.205 --> 20:56.148
Did he have a nickname?

20:57.410 --> 21:11.751
I don't think so, but there were a number of stories about him that wouldn't go right there with Screaming Al Nelson and some of the others.

21:13.790 --> 21:15.953
Two quick stories.

21:15.973 --> 21:20.738
One was he was riding his bicycle to work, and one of the sergeants in military science banged him a little bit.

21:20.758 --> 21:26.325
This car knocked him over, and so the sergeant got out of the truck and ran over.

21:26.345 --> 21:27.046
Are you all right, sir?

21:27.066 --> 21:27.746
Yes, yes, yes.

21:27.907 --> 21:29.268
Did you tell me which way I was going?

21:29.328 --> 21:30.470
He said, yes, you were going that way.

21:30.510 --> 21:30.870
Well, good.

21:30.890 --> 21:31.711
I've already had lunch.

21:33.033 --> 21:36.016
Now, probably not a true story, but this was the same.

21:36.477 --> 21:40.101
This was something easily believable about Jim Potter.

21:40.081 --> 21:46.130
The other was that he went to a physics meeting in Philadelphia one year and drove up there with the family and then flew home.

21:48.994 --> 21:57.786
I don't believe that one either, but he was the type of person that you could tell these stories about and people would believe.

21:58.103 --> 22:11.708
Was there allegedly in those early years a tough, tough, tough physics course that people had to take and was there a supposedly easy course?

22:11.992 --> 22:19.483
There, over the years, all of the physics courses have been, had reputations for being very difficult.

22:20.004 --> 22:24.250
But we did have a course, Physics for Poets type course.

22:25.172 --> 22:28.917
There was a Physics 350 that we taught for many, many years.

22:28.937 --> 22:33.544
It was a very popular course and taught by Nelson Duller for most of the time.

22:33.524 --> 22:52.883
And that course died out 15, 20 years ago and it started struggling when David Maxwell was dean of liberal arts and that he proclaimed, along with his faculty I guess, that their students couldn't take any course that was designed just for their students.

22:52.863 --> 22:54.925
Oh.

22:54.945 --> 23:02.572
And his argument was that they ought to be taking the courses that are designed for the engineers or the courses designed for the agricultural science people.

23:02.592 --> 23:07.256
Well, of course, none of his students were going to take those courses.

23:07.276 --> 23:10.579
They didn't have the mathematical sophistication to take those courses.

23:11.079 --> 23:16.244
So when he proclaimed that, then they couldn't take Physics 350.

23:17.185 --> 23:19.687
And so we didn't have enough students taking 350.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.870
And so over the years, the course died.

23:22.850 --> 23:32.779
Interestingly enough, I've now had inquiries from the College of Liberal Arts about whether we would revive that course and also from College of Education.

23:32.799 --> 23:33.640
It was an excellent course.

23:33.660 --> 23:37.824
I went to David and I said, well, if you don't think they're learning enough, why don't you come take the final exam?

23:39.846 --> 23:40.487
And he declined.

23:43.670 --> 23:51.557
Back in your early days, using the perspective now of 30, 35 years, describe the typical

23:52.128 --> 23:58.176
student taking your introductory physics courses then?

23:58.196 --> 23:59.678
How well prepared?

23:59.718 --> 24:02.081
Oh, they were very well prepared.

24:02.101 --> 24:13.456
They came in with good backgrounds and most of them did well.

24:13.776 --> 24:16.600
Where were they from geographically?

24:18.082 --> 24:24.650
full spectrum in small towns and all the way up to Houston, Dallas, and mostly from Texas, of course.

24:25.772 --> 24:31.098
And these were engineering majors, and this was their second year, they were sophomores?

24:31.379 --> 24:37.607
The course that I was teaching in those days was they were sophomores taking their second physics course.

24:38.107 --> 24:41.672
And were they still using slide rules?

24:41.692 --> 24:44.275
Yes, yes, certainly.

24:46.769 --> 24:51.614
I don't know quite when we quit using slide rules.

24:51.654 --> 24:52.375
Mine's right there.

24:55.117 --> 25:00.823
I have threatened to take it to class on occasion when the battery runs dead on some calculator is handing it to them and telling them they can use that.

25:04.146 --> 25:11.213
And share some anecdotes that you remember about some students in those days.

25:11.233 --> 25:13.856
Did they ever try any pranks on you in those early days?

25:13.916 --> 25:15.898
And if so, what were they?

25:15.878 --> 25:30.765
Oh, the things I remember, their excuses for not doing their homework or not... Well, the most interesting one I ever had was in the Vietnam era.

25:32.534 --> 25:35.661
You might recall we lost a B-52 over there.

25:36.663 --> 25:40.993
We didn't use B-52s early in that war, and then we started using B-52s.

25:41.815 --> 25:46.105
And the AB-52 was shot down, and there was a general officer on board.

25:47.570 --> 25:53.998
And I had a student who I'd already had some problems with early in the semester, and this was late in the semester.

25:54.839 --> 25:58.784
And this student missed my third exam.

25:58.804 --> 26:07.755
And so when he came back to talk to me about it, he said that he was sorry, but his father was on a B-52 that was shut down in Vietnam.

26:07.735 --> 26:22.858
and that his grandmother and mother had flown in from California and one of the military science instructors had flown them to Dallas and they waited up there to hear about his father.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.861
and so that he couldn't take my exam.

26:27.283 --> 26:31.048
And I just said, fine, fine, sure, that's fine, that's the only thing you could do.

26:31.248 --> 26:43.345
But as soon as he left, I walked over to Military Science where I had a number of friends, Tom Parsons being one of them, and there certainly was no truth to the story.

26:43.325 --> 26:45.729
Did you confront him with that?

26:45.749 --> 26:46.590
He never came back.

26:47.612 --> 26:55.685
He never came back, so he just disappeared after that and I didn't pay much attention because he was failing the course and failed it anyhow.

26:56.587 --> 27:06.042
The only thing that would have gotten him was a chance to take the exam over again or something, but I found it humorous.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.492
Did they ever try anything during class?

27:10.054 --> 27:15.159
No, I run a pretty tight ship during class and still do.

27:17.422 --> 27:19.664
Were they aware that you had been an undergraduate here?

27:20.245 --> 27:23.148
They usually become aware of that sometime during the semester.

27:23.428 --> 27:31.236
I used to wear my ring, but my knuckle has gotten such my ring won't fit.

27:32.397 --> 27:33.941
Now my ring is lost.

27:34.001 --> 27:37.009
It's somewhere around the house, I'm certain, but I can't find it.

27:37.029 --> 27:41.982
So yes, they become aware, and that's had different effects on different people.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.820
Let's see, no goofy phone calls from students?

27:49.677 --> 27:51.680
No, no.

27:51.900 --> 27:56.006
No homework identical to somebody else's or anything like that?

27:56.206 --> 27:56.586
Oh, yeah.

27:56.626 --> 28:00.632
I've had a few of those a long, long time, but I don't pay much attention to homework.

28:02.014 --> 28:12.788
My philosophy on homework is you take it up and you grade it because that puts pressure on them to work it, but I'm going to find out whether they've worked it or copied it off somebody on the exams.

28:13.289 --> 28:19.397
As you were a junior faculty member, to whom did you turn for advice and counsel?

28:20.761 --> 28:22.864
The senior, senior faculty.

28:22.884 --> 28:23.384
Which ones?

28:24.105 --> 28:25.267
Who were your favorite?

28:26.428 --> 28:29.372
Oh, we had, of course, Ben Bariski, of course, was one.

28:29.532 --> 28:39.845
And we had a fellow here in those days named Palmer, but I'm not going to be able to tell his last name.

28:41.767 --> 28:43.029
Barker, Palmer Barker.

28:43.710 --> 28:45.552
And they were a couple of the old, old timers.

28:45.572 --> 28:49.637
They'd been here when I was a student, and they were here while I was a young faculty member.

28:50.191 --> 28:51.372
Joe Hamm was another.

28:51.412 --> 29:02.503
He was a, he came while I was a student and then was here and just retired a few years ago.

29:03.283 --> 29:07.247
Do you remember any advice they gave you?

29:07.267 --> 29:10.911
No, not really.

29:10.931 --> 29:18.898
Now, I remember some advice that I got when I was an undergraduate from one of the counselors on campus.

29:20.296 --> 29:31.538
who became a counselor, and it's going to take me a minute to think of his name, he became a counselor out in the high school, and that's Buddy... Denton.

29:31.558 --> 29:33.202
Denton, yeah, Buddy.

29:33.222 --> 29:35.987
Buddy was a freshman advisor when I was a freshman here in 1953.

29:36.007 --> 29:41.899
Now, my parents came up to a football game one time,

29:43.803 --> 29:47.467
and found me in the hospital.

29:47.488 --> 29:52.293
And I had some, I don't know what I had, but I had something that put me in the hospital.

29:52.333 --> 29:56.459
So they took me home and I missed 10 days of school.

29:56.479 --> 29:57.860
And midterm grades came out.

29:57.880 --> 30:02.426
I made three F's and D and B or something like that.

30:02.466 --> 30:08.133
And so Buddy advised me to drop out of school and come back in January.

30:08.153 --> 30:09.895
But I said I didn't think so.

30:10.938 --> 30:15.967
And so I stayed, and of course by the end of the semester I had turned the grades around.

30:15.987 --> 30:21.176
I certainly didn't make straight A's, but I got my grades up.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.019
Were you married when you joined the faculty?

30:23.600 --> 30:23.800
Yes.

30:24.041 --> 30:27.006
I got married in 62 when I came back as a graduate student.

30:27.172 --> 30:33.061
Describe what it was like for a young couple to move to College Station.

30:34.282 --> 30:35.023
That was interesting.

30:35.104 --> 30:42.254
It came in 62, just newly married, and in those days Texas A&M did not have a personnel to do it.

30:43.195 --> 30:49.845
And if somebody wanted a job, they had to go from department to department to department.

30:50.466 --> 30:56.014
And so Carolyn was out going from department to department, ran into Clark Monroe,

30:55.994 --> 30:59.558
And he had just been hired as director of personnel in 1962.

31:00.819 --> 31:03.222
And so he... That's M-U-N-R-O-E.

31:05.925 --> 31:06.145
Okay.

31:07.587 --> 31:10.290
And so Clark hired Carolyn.

31:10.931 --> 31:15.996
They were the first two people who work in the personnel office here.

31:16.056 --> 31:21.162
Shortly after that, he discovered the mistake he had made and that she was not a secretary.

31:21.182 --> 31:22.263
So they hired a secretary.

31:22.323 --> 31:24.085
And then there were three of them.

31:24.105 --> 31:25.647
And so my...
