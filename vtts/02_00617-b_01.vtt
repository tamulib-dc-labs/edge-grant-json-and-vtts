WEBVTT

00:15.404 --> 00:17.045
He probably never even heard of radar. He had never 
heard of radar. And this was just like a voice from

00:19.928 --> 00:23.351
above.

00:26.114 --> 00:27.515
May have made a religious man out of him.

00:33.821 --> 00:40.607
But I think this is what we're beginning to see now a 
little bit in oceanography.

00:40.667 --> 00:44.230
So many of the things that would have been not 
possible 20 or 30 years ago, are now becoming

00:44.530 --> 00:56.387
commonplace.

00:56.407 --> 01:10.386
If you had some advice you would like to offer a 
young person, what in oceanography or what

00:56.407 --> 01:10.386
particular aspect of oceanography would you 
suggest to that person that he or she do? Well, I

01:12.982 --> 01:18.166
haven't advised students for a few years now. 
Formerly, when a student came down to talk to me

01:20.408 --> 01:41.807
about entering oceanography, I would try to see 
what his goals in life were, and

01:20.408 --> 01:41.807
how long he expected to go, and so on. And I told him 
that in oceanography, just from the

01:43.053 --> 02:00.135
prerequisites we had, that he would get a very 
broad basic training in the sciences, and that

01:43.053 --> 02:00.135
this was essential. Then he could later go on his 
way. If he wanted to make money and get through

02:06.123 --> 02:09.567
quickly, why I told him that you'd never make much 
money in oceanography, that something like that,

02:10.120 --> 02:31.707
why you would be better to shift to some other 
discipline and stay in a particular discipline,

02:10.120 --> 02:31.707
and you would be on the production line at an 
earlier date.

02:34.711 --> 02:36.533
But if you wanted to to continue in a very 
interesting field that had many ramifications

02:37.120 --> 03:00.687
outside of your own particular area of interest, 
you would always find that you had so much more to do

02:37.120 --> 03:00.687
than you could possibly do that it would be very 
satisfying.

03:03.090 --> 03:06.874
And as a result, we've had people go through and 
quite a few of them have shifted over to medicine of

03:07.647 --> 03:28.591
all things after they've taken some oceanography 
because we require this chemistry and the other

03:07.647 --> 03:28.591
sciences which gave them a good

03:07.647 --> 03:28.591
background.

03:31.634 --> 03:34.718
And so I've always maintained that the first step 
was to get a good, broad, basic education

03:35.288 --> 03:58.935
so you could be acquainted with the different 
facets, able to do a lot of things, and then to

03:35.288 --> 03:58.935
specialize in something that was of particular 
interest to you. We lost some students that way.

04:03.082 --> 04:09.491
But I think the ones we retained were probably 
never felt that they were shortchanged.

04:13.757 --> 04:25.714
And it's surprising to watch what some of the 
people did go into after they had had their

04:13.757 --> 04:25.714
training in oceanography. Well, Washington has 
what amounts to, or Washington had what amounted

04:27.668 --> 04:36.359
to, the only undergraduate school of 
oceanography in the country, and certainly had

04:27.668 --> 04:36.359
the first. That's right. Were there any sort of 
deliberate plans or ideas you had in terms of the

04:38.642 --> 04:43.729
creation of the school? Did you have some sort of a 
broad concept of what you thought an

04:43.789 --> 04:48.135
oceanographer should be?

04:51.700 --> 04:57.287
Well, we've often felt that an oceanographer 
should have. a broad training in the physical and

04:57.503 --> 05:04.914
the biological sciences and the math base. And of 
course, these

05:06.917 --> 05:25.485
were hard to become harder to fulfill as we become 
more sophisticated in all of the contributing

05:06.917 --> 05:25.485
disciplines.

05:26.360 --> 05:43.160
One example, at Friday Harbor, there was a course 
given that Dr. Thompson called Omnology,

05:26.360 --> 05:43.160
which bracketed the field. And so in this 
particular course, there would be people from the

05:43.300 --> 05:55.354
biological sciences, Bob Miller, for example, 
that was director of the California Academy of

05:55.807 --> 06:25.172
Sciences for many years, Steinhardt Aquarium, 
that was here, and Utterback in physics, Thompson

05:55.807 --> 06:25.172
in chemistry, and

05:55.807 --> 06:25.172
other zoologists, botanists and zoologists, 
contributed to this course to sort of give people a

05:55.807 --> 06:25.172
broad understanding of the general area. and not 
to force people in any particular direction, but

06:25.878 --> 06:36.431
to open their eyes on the spectrum in which they can 
look and make up their own minds. In that way, if

06:36.471 --> 06:48.065
they choose unwisely,

06:36.471 --> 06:48.065
it's more or less their own doing. But if they 
choose unwisely without having some sort of a

06:48.145 --> 06:54.433
concept of what other alternatives there are, 
then I think that's part of the blame of the

06:54.717 --> 07:02.007
instructional staff.

07:09.196 --> 07:20.191
Now, I have now sort of a couple of questions I'd 
like to ask concerning what amounts to the period

07:09.196 --> 07:20.191
between about 1939 and about 1945, 1946. In the 
Hydrographic Office, and on the Bikini Test and in

07:24.046 --> 07:28.733
sort of the early work in the Arctic. Did you notice 
much conflict between military and civilian

07:29.414 --> 07:50.104
personnel in terms of approaches to oceanography 
or personality clashes either at the Test or in the

07:29.414 --> 07:50.104
Hydrographic Office or what have you?

07:50.124 --> 07:53.108
Well, I've had a little bit of experience on both 
sides. And personally, I've always gotten along

07:54.472 --> 08:04.687
very well with both the civilian and military. But 
whenever you get these different groups

08:04.707 --> 08:15.602
together, they've, as a rule, been brought up 
through different things. pathways of training

08:16.342 --> 08:18.966
and so on. They each have their own job. So you 
expect, at times, a little bit of friction. One of

08:25.838 --> 08:29.624
them is based on action and directing other people 
a great deal. And the other is based on the science

08:29.685 --> 08:42.366
of the situation, what

08:29.685 --> 08:42.366
we know for sure, what's imagination. And

08:42.903 --> 08:47.008
that sort of thing. There have been, and I've 
worked on a lot of different ships with a lot of

08:47.589 --> 09:07.915
different people, and it comes down, I think, not 
so much as to the difference between a civilian

08:47.589 --> 09:07.915
scientist and a particular naval officer.

09:10.730 --> 09:25.388
as far as their different routines are concerned, 
but goes back to the individuals, the people that

09:10.730 --> 09:25.388
can see both sides of a question and leave a 
flexibility. There are certain situations where

09:25.428 --> 09:29.313
the first thing you must do is save the ship. It 
takes precedence over all else. There are other

09:33.458 --> 09:36.282
times when... you must accomplish your 
scientific protection or the mission is a

09:36.447 --> 09:44.836
failure. And it goes back to the personalities. So 
some cruises are highly successful. Other

09:53.205 --> 10:02.455
cruises may work out not too satisfactorily.

10:04.763 --> 10:12.054
in terms of the beginning, you know, the bringing 
in of the ships and the vessels, and research time,

10:04.763 --> 10:12.054
really, is what I'm thinking of. There was a time 
when you first began, in terms of oceanography,

10:12.395 --> 10:28.459
where there were just sort of blanket grants, and 
this is also sort of a follow-up on military and

10:12.395 --> 10:28.459
civilian conflicts, possibly, sort of blanket 
grants given to an institution, and the

10:12.395 --> 10:28.459
institution sort of dispersed the grants and and 
allowed one to work on his project. And then later

10:31.848 --> 10:48.320
on it seems to me that oceanography became more 
mission oriented and in one sense and in the other

10:31.848 --> 10:48.320
sense in terms of giving grants you had to apply 
individually for grants and the grants were

10:31.848 --> 10:48.320
awarded based upon the individual project. Now 
Which way did you prefer it? Did you prefer it where

10:50.478 --> 10:55.883
the institution just sort of received the grant 
and then divide the money up in faculty? Or did you

10:56.624 --> 11:05.273
prefer it after NSF came along and you applied for 
individual grants? Well, both methods have their

11:05.293 --> 11:13.122
advantages and drawbacks. I think if you're 
starting up, Bob, something that

11:18.929 --> 11:45.325
I really believe that the early formulation of the 
Office of Naval Research, which I was pretty well

11:18.929 --> 11:45.325
acquainted with as it grew back in Washington, 
D.C., and the early years where they gave money to

11:18.929 --> 11:45.325
the institutions, I think that was a remarkable 
system. I think the Office of National Research

11:48.293 --> 11:54.321
has done a very good job over the years. And some of 
that same group, of course, went over to the

11:55.422 --> 12:01.871
National Science Foundation. I was at one time in

12:01.971 --> 12:15.109
my career involved a little bit in going back and 
looking over the programs as part of the

12:18.430 --> 12:36.413
group that were advising on oceanography,

12:18.430 --> 12:36.413
the executive office of the president, and

12:18.430 --> 12:36.413
trying to pass out

12:18.430 --> 12:36.413
things. But I think you have to have a little bit of 
both, really. Because, well, of course, there's

12:41.719 --> 12:46.345
an awful lot of time lost now in what I call 
overhead, which not only as far as the funds are

12:47.084 --> 12:56.055
concerned, but I'm thinking of scientist time. 
You mean in grant writing and proposal writing? In

12:59.159 --> 13:03.184
grant writing, proposal writing, and so on. And 
this will work in different ways. If you have a

13:07.329 --> 13:16.180
benign godfather that looks out after all your 
interests and takes care of this for you and gives

13:07.329 --> 13:16.180
you then full freedom and the funds to go ahead 
with, that's beautiful. But there's always a day

13:16.885 --> 13:20.008
of reckoning.

13:22.791 --> 13:27.116
And it goes back to the individual, and it goes back 
to cooperation all along the line. Between the

13:27.176 --> 13:46.437
individual scientists and the administration in 
his own particular department or so on, and then in

13:27.176 --> 13:46.437
the university, it must be framed within the 
university administration as well. So it takes a

13:47.227 --> 13:53.376
lot of give and take all along the line. And the 
better knowledge the different levels have and

13:53.416 --> 14:08.058
the understanding, they can do a very good job of 
administering sometimes if they don't know too

13:53.416 --> 14:08.058
much of the details. But when the chips are really 
down, to be sure that you're getting a high

14:13.872 --> 14:25.362
percentage of efficiency, why it takes the people 
in their different ranks to know an awful lot about

14:13.872 --> 14:25.362
what goes on at all levels. And I think this is 
probably one of the problems in government today,

14:26.363 --> 14:43.137
that it's become so complex that you just don't 
have this direct contact, this chain of knowledge

14:26.363 --> 14:43.137
that goes through from the beginning raw 
materials, you might say, to the finished

14:26.363 --> 14:43.137
product.

14:46.188 --> 14:52.317
In the organization of the early O&R office, I 
assume the idea must have come from Roger Revelle.

14:52.397 --> 14:52.998
Is that correct? Well, Roger Revelle was over in 
the Bureau of Ships and was in a very strategic

14:53.959 --> 15:04.914
position there. He was responsible here in a major 
sense for the scientific operations in the In 46

15:15.027 --> 15:17.650
that I mentioned. Yeah. And so, but there were 
others that also involved

15:20.954 --> 15:33.290
a great deal in that. Now, Roger was back on the 
scene. And from the strict oceanographic

15:35.973 --> 15:44.764
standpoint, he was sort of the champion along that 
particular. But

15:45.487 --> 15:52.375
we had a number of people that were very 
knowledgeable.

15:55.159 --> 15:59.924
And for a while, the Navy had the Research and 
Development Board, you see. And we had some good

16:01.326 --> 16:15.443
heads there that were quite

16:01.326 --> 16:15.443
cognizant of what was really necessary to get 
something going in oceanography. Before that, we

16:24.099 --> 16:36.816
had had, of course, the Rockefeller Fund in the 
30s, which built the building at Scripps, Woods

16:24.099 --> 16:36.816
Hole, and this building here. I didn't know anyone 
built this building, too. Yes. This is the

16:38.939 --> 16:43.405
Rockefeller Fund building.

16:45.443 --> 17:08.093
And I

16:45.443 --> 17:08.093
think from that sort of a stimulus, getting some of 
the early places going in Hawaii, and then the next

16:45.443 --> 17:08.093
big step, I would say, was the Office of Naval 
Research, which really got things going. in a more

17:08.545 --> 17:12.189
modern sense in oceanography. There had been an 
awful lot of the people involved in this that were

17:12.209 --> 17:22.480
very much connected with the operations during 
World War II. And so they had a good grasp. A lot of

17:29.488 --> 17:32.491
them were civilians at all times. But there were 
also some of the Navy people that were quite

17:38.347 --> 17:42.533
cognizant of what was going on. Were you unhappy 
when, that's the wrong choice of word, were you

17:42.553 --> 18:05.586
surprised rather and somewhat chagrined when the 
ONR swings away from really research and

17:42.553 --> 18:05.586
development and into mission-oriented work 
almost exclusively?

18:06.578 --> 18:16.067
I think

18:06.578 --> 18:16.067
that you have to have a mix in this. I would say that 
if you're exclusively mission-oriented,

18:16.367 --> 18:34.425
what hurt you is maybe not what you do, but what 
you're not aware of or don't do.

18:34.810 --> 18:51.229
that you have to have this broad freedom of free 
inquiry to set the base for the future.

18:51.369 --> 19:04.665
When the chips are down, you don't have much chance 
or time to find out the basic information you need

18:51.369 --> 19:04.665
to carry out your operations. then you've got to 
take what you've got at that time. And it becomes

19:08.956 --> 19:14.125
mostly inoperational. But in the easy times in the 
world, if there are such things, that's the time

19:14.145 --> 19:32.374
that people should take time to learn as much as 
they can about the environment and how things go.

19:32.911 --> 19:43.783
and to push some of, many will be dead ends, but to 
push some of this information to its

19:32.911 --> 19:43.783
ultimate end, whatever that may be.

19:46.766 --> 19:50.209
Now, excuse me. I've got something in my throat 
about the last five minutes. I must have a sign.

19:54.654 --> 19:54.995
Scripts?

19:59.600 --> 19:59.960
No. Uh... As I recall, I met Ravel when I was up in 
Alaska on one of the cruises. Oh, okay, because he

20:08.273 --> 20:09.474
took a cruise. He told me he had met you, and

20:09.494 --> 20:27.100
he had intimated with sometimes in the 30s, and 
then when I was listening to the tape, I couldn't

20:09.494 --> 20:27.100
figure out when it was because I couldn't put you 
two together anyplace, you see, because you just

20:09.494 --> 20:27.100
say your assignments, woods, holes. and, you 
know, and the University of Washington. So I never

20:30.299 --> 20:35.486
really got you somehow in the, when I was looking 
you up, I never really somehow got you into the

20:30.299 --> 20:35.486
Navy. You know, it didn't make any sense to me. I was 
actually in the Coast Guard. Called me in the Coast

20:40.093 --> 20:40.894
Guard. Yeah, but I worked with the Navy. And I was in 
a very unique and satisfying position. And so I

20:46.323 --> 20:55.416
couldn't forget when you first encountered 
Revell, because when they were putting those

20:46.323 --> 20:55.416
groups of people to sit together, you know, up to 
the bikini test,

20:58.552 --> 21:00.775
I can understand why certain were selected. And I 
can understand how you got there from Woods Hole,

21:01.997 --> 21:05.903
but I never put you in the service to get you there. 
That was the confusing part. I put Revell in the

21:07.145 --> 21:09.048
service, of course. Yeah. He was already there.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.101
Excuse me. It can't be Washington weather, 
believe me.

21:24.172 --> 21:24.492
The other... During this period, you're talking 
about here in the 1940s now, there were three

21:24.758 --> 21:36.474
people who sort of dominated the concept of grant 
giving and oceanography, and the direction

21:24.758 --> 21:36.474
oceanography was taking. And this is an 
oversimplification, of course, but it's Revell,

21:37.215 --> 21:42.483
Columbus Island, of course, and Maurice Ewing. 
Yes, and I worked with New Columbus very well. The

21:48.731 --> 21:54.259
first year I was at Atwoods Hall, why I think there 
were 13 of us in the Woods Hole Oceanographic

21:55.201 --> 22:06.554
Institution that were more or less permanent 
residents during the wintertime. Floyd So and

22:07.395 --> 22:18.268
myself and Columbus Island would run the risk back 
and forth across Martha's Vineyard.

22:20.731 --> 22:24.415
Dean Bumpus was there. Morris Ewing was there with 
Warzel and Albine, and the Whale Man from Harvard,

22:24.749 --> 22:41.616
Bilgeville, a part of the time. And Cywell was 
there at that time. And so it was a rather small,

22:52.778 --> 23:03.589
fairly close-knit group in some ways. And that was 
the time when I became acquainted with a number of

23:04.610 --> 23:10.455
people, early people. Norris Raikstra would come 
down on weekends. Big load. He was pretty well

23:16.301 --> 23:22.127
entranced at Harvard by that time, and hardly 
ever. ever got down, but we did. Mary Sears was

23:25.192 --> 23:39.488
there,

23:25.192 --> 23:39.488
certainly on weekends until she finally built her 
house down in Woods Hole and stayed down

23:25.192 --> 23:39.488
there. But I think, and I'm just trying to recall 
just exactly when it was that I met Revell. And it

23:47.257 --> 23:51.422
was, I don't know whether it was I just can't place 
it in 1933 or 1934

23:51.723 --> 24:11.665
that he was up in Alaska and had met him then.

24:14.428 --> 24:18.473
And Dick Fleming, I met I don't know what he calls it 
or not, when he was up here with Moberg, I think, one

24:20.039 --> 24:37.189
time when we had a either Pacific Science 
Convention here in Seattle or something like

24:20.039 --> 24:37.189
that. And Tommy Thompson, you see, worked with the 
people at Scripps. He worked with McKeown. in

24:44.204 --> 24:58.379
1929, in the Gulf of Alaska, on the currents, and 
Van Cleve was one of our, that was out on the cruise

24:44.204 --> 24:58.379
there. So it was this time, about that time that I 
met him.

25:11.893 --> 25:13.435
What sort of man was Columbus Islip? I had a great 
admiration for Columbus.

25:23.302 --> 25:42.882
He was rather shy, very

25:23.302 --> 25:42.882
open-minded, I think, very concerned with 
pushing forward Oceanography, as a scientist, of

25:43.874 --> 25:53.287
course, they were pretty well healed. And you 
brought the Atlantis I back to Europe and made some

25:53.307 --> 26:13.155
cruises up on the Grand Banks, up in Labrador, I 
think, fairly early on. And

26:14.671 --> 26:26.421
I always recall him saying that this is about the 
end of just the venture beginning to straighten

26:14.671 --> 26:26.421
out. And one of his big worries here, he says, no, 
the money is getting fairly tight. And I'm just

26:34.609 --> 26:39.053
worried about laying up the Atlantis one. And

26:46.379 --> 27:06.608
But

26:46.379 --> 27:06.608
he says, I think we got enough information in our 
data bank that we can weather out two or three years

26:46.379 --> 27:06.608
without going to see if we have

26:46.379 --> 27:06.608
to. Well, you know, the story was old since then.

27:15.083 --> 27:27.695
And the man that was really one of the, well, a spill 
house was occasionally down in Woods Hole, but he

27:15.083 --> 27:27.695
was just sort of a weekend visitor at that time. But 
Morris Ewing was always a go-getter as far as

27:30.098 --> 27:43.011
getting an awful lot done and being a good 
scientist.

27:43.031 --> 27:44.432
And he had a good little group. going early on at 
Woods Hole, working on different projects, his

27:44.699 --> 27:53.172
underwater acoustics and so on. His services were 
great.

27:58.019 --> 28:12.360
I'll never forget one time he called up, he got 
stranded up in Middlebury or something like that,

27:58.019 --> 28:12.360
up in mid-state, up in Massachusetts. the 
communications were terrible in those days he got

28:12.813 --> 28:35.395
got called up the oceanographic institution i 
happened to be the only one around that evening and

28:12.813 --> 28:35.395
so i finally he got through he says well i'm i'm up 
here with all my gear and i need to need

28:12.813 --> 28:35.395
transportation and when can you be up and pick me up 
and i'd never I don't think I'd... I don't know

28:37.472 --> 28:39.394
whether I'd met him then or not. Of course, I knew 
he... Yes, I had. I'd met him before because he'd

28:40.836 --> 28:49.187
been out of university here one time along the 
early 30s, just a trip through. And I said, well,

28:49.227 --> 28:57.437
I'll be up and pick you up just as soon as I can get up 
there. And to be standing out someplace where I can

28:58.538 --> 29:03.324
see you, I just got there. So I went up and... and he 
saw me drive up and he says, my gosh, he said, I

29:06.509 --> 29:23.026
thought I was talking to Al Vine.

29:23.046 --> 29:28.211
There are communications with that poor on those 
old Woods Hole phones. He never forgot that. He

29:32.035 --> 29:36.499
reminded me of it the last time I saw him here a few 
years back.

29:41.508 --> 29:46.093
But I had a great appreciation for him. And it's 
very unfortunate in my area of the world to bring

29:46.193 --> 29:57.406
one of the small ships back from Greenland. And we 
gave him a choice of going out the outside, which we

29:58.027 --> 30:04.795
always recommended. But he wanted to get back,

30:04.815 --> 30:11.042
take the shortcut, time a little bit through the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence, through the Strait of Belle

30:11.731 --> 30:21.853
Isle, and his ship was lost with all hands from 
icing conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. That

30:22.054 --> 30:26.183
was Lafarge, Mrs. Island's brother. So that was a 
blow to me and to Columbus, I know.
