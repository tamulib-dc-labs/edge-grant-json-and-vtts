WEBVTT

00:07.793 --> 00:12.377
Did you have any favorite instructors during your 
student days?

00:19.744 --> 00:21.626
Yes, D.B. Cofer was one in English, and my freshman 
English, I got credit for that, but I had to take a

00:21.666 --> 00:35.539
one-hour lecture course that was called 
contemporary civilization, I believe it was,

00:35.755 --> 00:50.377
that, not F.L., but Thomas, who was

00:35.755 --> 00:50.377
in the engineering, I mean the English 
department, taught. I enjoyed that. Probably one

00:53.442 --> 01:00.312
who really didn't have a course on him, but took a 
visit to course, was Fritz Hensel. and Nestor

01:00.595 --> 01:01.977
McGinnis. Now they were off in landscape 
architecture and floriculture, but I was

01:01.997 --> 01:07.002
interested in that too. And being a regular, 
because I had credit for this English, each year I

01:07.083 --> 01:17.615
was able to take one or two courses extra of 
something that I was particularly interested in.

01:17.655 --> 01:25.084
So I took Nestor McGinnis and Hensel's course in 
landscape ornamentals. And Dr. F. E. Giesecke, I

01:25.104 --> 01:28.948
was very fond of him. He had been here many years 
earlier as head of the engineering drawing

01:29.688 --> 01:39.879
department and then migrated to the University of 
Texas as the head of their architecture

01:29.688 --> 01:39.879
department. My junior year, I believe it was, he 
returned to A&M as head of the department of

01:41.261 --> 01:58.480
architecture, college architect, and director 
of the engineering experiment station. I worked

01:58.713 --> 02:07.242
very close with him my senior year particularly 
and then for quite a number of years afterwards and

01:58.713 --> 02:07.242
employed at the university or college at that 
time.

02:10.706 --> 02:13.048
Si Sanston was another one I enjoyed. I had to have a 
course over in the civil engineering department

02:13.068 --> 02:25.682
in engineering contracts and law.

02:26.827 --> 02:30.112
What did the students do for entertainment and 
recreation?

02:34.459 --> 02:39.206
I think I might preface this by a statement made by a 
brother of mine. My next younger brother came to

02:39.266 --> 02:44.014
A&M after he graduated.

02:47.259 --> 02:48.661
No, I've got my brothers mixed up. My youngest 
brother came to A&M one year and he got so strongly

02:54.316 --> 03:21.454
in love that he dropped out that year and married 
and wound up in the Corps of Engineers and then

02:54.316 --> 03:21.454
later was inducted into the Army and after the war 
he came back and decided to go back to school and he

02:54.316 --> 03:21.454
looked at the University of Texas and looked at A&M 
and then when he was visiting over here with me

02:54.316 --> 03:21.454
later we were walking across the campus and I made 
some comment about I think we had orange no parking

03:21.923 --> 03:26.549
signs painted on the curbs. And I mentioned to him 
that the students one time refused to go to class

03:26.589 --> 03:35.439
because they had to pass over these orange painted 
signs. And he says, well, that's the difference

03:35.539 --> 03:39.164
between the University of Texas and A&M. They have 
something to do over in Austin. And over at A&M,

03:41.687 --> 03:48.555
they've got to make their entertainment and 
pleasures out of whatever they can find around

03:41.687 --> 03:48.555
here. Well, there wasn't a lot to do at A&M, in the 
social end, really. Wednesday nights and

03:58.791 --> 04:11.171
Saturday nights, I had a picture show in Assembly 
Hall, which was on the site of the present chapel.

04:11.211 --> 04:17.682
This was built during the

04:11.211 --> 04:17.682
First World War. It was a wooden stucco building. 
So almost everybody could rake up 10 cents or 15

04:23.813 --> 04:27.919
cents. Usually went to the movie at night, 
Wednesday night and Saturday night. Freshmen had

04:36.792 --> 04:48.850
an interesting sideline for Saturday night 
because it was custom then, at least in the fall

04:36.792 --> 04:48.850
semester, for freshmen to air out. after the 
theater, after the showing there. By airing out,

04:54.056 --> 05:03.369
this meant they had to leave the dormitory and go 
out anywhere they could find a place and spend the

04:54.056 --> 05:03.369
night sleeping out in the woods. I remember the 
first Saturday night I had on the campus.

05:11.101 --> 05:19.613
For some reason or other, I took out toward the 
east, which was down at that time back in the horse

05:11.101 --> 05:19.613
barns where the system administration building 
is now, and found a farm back over there that was

05:20.167 --> 05:29.823
growing watermelons. So I had a watermelon to 
settle my stomach that night before I tried to bed

05:31.406 --> 05:41.803
down in the patch out there somewhere to sleep. 
eased back in the dormitory somewhere between 2

05:42.661 --> 05:48.346
and 3 o'clock in the morning when most everyone had 
gone to sleep. But this was a common thing for

05:48.406 --> 05:53.371
Saturday nights, the upperclassmen airing out 
the fish. And Sunday afternoons, the big event was

05:55.713 --> 06:04.761
to go down and see

05:55.713 --> 06:04.761
the Southern Pacific train come in.

06:08.204 --> 06:12.448
In the early part of the year, quite often on 
Sundays, particularly good weather, fish band or

06:14.032 --> 06:43.009
a fish group including some musical instruments 
and the rest armed with brooms had the job of going

06:14.032 --> 06:43.009
down and to the railroad station and sweeping out 
the train much to the dismay and surprise of the

06:14.032 --> 06:43.009
passengers on the train but while it was here they 
went in and swept out the train not to say the dismay

06:14.032 --> 06:43.009
of the railroad of course they usually wore some 
outlandish costume. They were not in full

06:45.407 --> 06:47.429
uniform. And other things, you might wander 
around and take a hike around in the woods. Some of

06:55.537 --> 07:00.603
the ponds, there used to be a lake down in what was 
called College Park.

07:03.946 --> 07:08.811
That's in the corner of Jersey and Weldon Road. 
Well, Jersey and Dexter, yes, in that corner.

07:15.415 --> 07:24.643
College Park, that was the only area that there 
were any private homes

07:15.415 --> 07:24.643
at that time, and there were a few there. But there 
was a lake in there that later was drained during

07:25.304 --> 07:35.113
the predominance of malaria in this area. Well, 
that was, I take it, a privately owned lake? It was

07:38.339 --> 07:48.798
owned by the Southside Development Company, who 
was a real estate organization of a number of

07:38.339 --> 07:48.798
faculty people. Dan Scotes was head of ag 
engineering, and I started to call him Wheezy

07:48.838 --> 07:55.109
Clark. That was his name, common name. Dr. F.B. 
Clark was a member of it.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.862
I can't think of his name. His wife is still alive, a 
little chemistry prof at the sector. A number of

08:13.448 --> 08:21.877
the college staff had gone together to try to set up 
some place where a person might build a home. And

08:23.038 --> 08:31.787
they had built a number of what were called company 
homes that they rented to faculty people.

08:31.807 --> 08:34.570
Was there a swimming pool in the basement of the Y? 
There was a swimming pool in the basement of the Y,

08:35.208 --> 08:38.152
that's right. This was after the P.L. Downs 
Auditorium was built. The YMCA floored it over and

08:45.584 --> 08:53.456
put a bowling alley there first and then had a few 
billiard tables. You might go to the Y on the

08:53.476 --> 09:02.329
weekend and play some billiards or go swimming in 
the small indoor pool.

09:05.954 --> 09:14.486
And of course, the big activity, of course, were 
all the various balls that were held on the campus.

09:14.646 --> 09:24.621
And many times, the entire main dining room and 
annex of the Speza Hall were just packed and jammed

09:14.646 --> 09:24.621
with participants. At that time, of course, 
people danced with each other, arm to arm or body to

09:26.063 --> 09:35.556
body, or what you might call it. The poor girl who 
danced more than ten steps or so with one chap

09:37.257 --> 09:46.846
thought she was a wallflower, maybe. Because 
there were, of course, a predominance of stags

09:47.847 --> 09:54.754
there, but many of them were programmed dances. 
And the big balls, of course, were the football

09:54.954 --> 10:06.606
weekends and the Ross volunteer dances in the 
spring area. Was the RV hop only open to members of

10:07.160 --> 10:10.803
the RVs? They usually had their activities seemed 
like three days. I was not an RV and at one or two of

10:18.130 --> 10:26.979
those dances I believe they permitted others to 
come. Then of course we had the big Bozar Ball which

10:27.059 --> 10:35.547
is the architectural club's annual dance and all 
of these dances There were usually very extensive

10:36.404 --> 10:43.795
decorations erected in the main ballroom of 
Sabeza Hall. And of course the dance after the

10:45.558 --> 10:55.634
Thanksgiving game was usually almost impossible 
because it was so thick you could hardly move in

10:45.558 --> 10:55.634
that time. I would imagine you had former students 
as well as students there. Texas and A&M and

10:59.067 --> 11:08.881
everybody, anybody wanted to go and want those and 
all you had to do was have the price of the ticket to

10:59.067 --> 11:08.881
get in those dances. And then of course the various 
military organizations had their dances and some

11:08.901 --> 11:14.690
of the other clubs.

11:17.494 --> 11:24.705
And then there was the staff and faculty dances 
about once a month I guess. And occasionally we had

11:28.075 --> 11:37.947
entertainment

11:28.075 --> 11:37.947
series, anything from an opera up and down in Guyon 
Hall. Of course, these were never, you know, more

11:39.709 --> 11:42.753
than four or five of them a year. Of course, on 
Sunday morning you had a march in the chapel,

11:44.836 --> 11:54.808
which was compulsory at that time. And that was in 
Guyon? That was in Guyon Hall. The old chapel was

11:57.298 --> 12:00.624
discontinued. It was a chapel after Guyon Hall was 
erected in what, 1920, somewhere in there? 18, I

12:08.896 --> 12:09.297
believe. 19, 18, 20. And the old chapel became the 
armory for many years. It was the armory when I was

12:14.165 --> 12:15.847
here. And I have a small rifle range in there, a 
little range.

12:25.248 --> 12:31.018
This was later moved to a metal shed down on the side 
of the present laundry. There was a laundry, it was

12:31.840 --> 12:49.652
west of the laundry because it was discontinued, 
because the

12:31.840 --> 12:49.652
bullet stops in there got worn in and a stray bullet 
or two went through the laundry, so they shut that

12:31.840 --> 12:49.652
down. That would be a factor, wouldn't it? I bought 
her plate in there for stopping the bullets, but

12:51.384 --> 12:58.231
after they shot so many times in the same place.

13:01.755 --> 13:07.962
Did you have any student theatrical groups or 
anything of that nature to put on plays or was that a

13:01.755 --> 13:07.962
later development?

13:11.326 --> 13:13.028
I don't remember any at all. We had not an actor's 
club, there was a scribbler's club that Tommy Mayo

13:19.822 --> 13:25.491
and Dr. Summey particularly in the English 
department sponsored. I wasn't much a writer, but

13:27.494 --> 13:29.998
I enjoyed going to the meetings. But I don't think 
there were any dramatic things. Now there was, at

13:36.127 --> 13:44.059
that time we had the Greek Club, the forerunner of 
the singing cadets. Our principal job under the

13:48.408 --> 13:53.876
direction of the band director then, Richard 
Dunn, later called Colonel Dunn. We sang for

13:56.259 --> 14:00.786
chapel services on Sunday morning. That's about 
all we tried. The Scribblers Club did what? Oh, it

14:05.312 --> 14:15.867
was a club that those people who were interested in 
trying to write a little and studying various

14:05.312 --> 14:15.867
writings, And as I say, Dr. and Ms. Summey were 
particular sponsors of that club. There were lots

14:22.653 --> 14:35.429
of clubs, of course, different as they are now, and 
different both organizations, hometown clubs,

14:22.653 --> 14:35.429
and

14:22.653 --> 14:35.429
some along the educational lines. I did a little 
checking in your senior Longhorn, and there was an

14:36.911 --> 14:42.478
indication that you were a member of the Dome Club. 
Well, the dome club, that was so called because the

14:43.690 --> 15:02.880
senior architectural students in the 
engineering phase of architecture

14:43.690 --> 15:02.880
had their drafting tables and classes up in the 
unfinished dome of the academic building, the old

14:43.690 --> 15:02.880
main building. So we were members of the Dome Club. 
It really wasn't a formal organization, except

15:06.592 --> 15:13.766
that meant you spent most of your senior year up in 
the Dome. So that would have been seniors in

15:13.826 --> 15:16.591
architecture. Right.

15:29.995 --> 15:35.780
We know that a goodly number of students at various 
times had jobs of one type or another on campus. Did

15:35.820 --> 15:38.823
you have any jobs while you were a student? I had two 
particular jobs. One of them for a while I worked

15:42.606 --> 15:52.355
for Missouri

15:42.606 --> 15:52.355
Pacific Railroad as a night clerk. My job was 
mainly to take off the mail and the baggage trunks

15:58.750 --> 16:03.318
and things that came in during the night and put 
them in the warehouse at the station. I remember

16:04.520 --> 16:10.610
one afternoon I was on duty though, and I had a 
rather unexpected job. A horse came in by express

16:11.130 --> 16:14.396
in a crate. And for a while I was at loss how I was 
going to get that horse out of the baggage car, but

16:16.259 --> 16:21.788
we managed. I guess the biggest thing, though, was 
unloading a bale of cotton by myself one night. I

16:28.081 --> 16:33.927
don't know why it came in, but there's many 
unexpected things were coming in because of

16:28.081 --> 16:33.927
research activities. You'd normally get it at a 
freight station instead of coming in by express.

16:41.534 --> 16:51.083
Then

16:41.534 --> 16:51.083
my senior year, I worked, well, I worked this 
preceding summer At A&M, before our junior and

16:51.974 --> 17:02.364
senior years, architecture students had to come 
back to A&M three weeks early to take summer

16:51.974 --> 17:02.364
practice in architecture. And I remember the 
first year I worked on the side, the Ag Experiment

17:03.685 --> 17:11.012
Station needed some people to pick cotton. Well, 
this wasn't ordinary picking. You were paid by the

17:14.575 --> 17:20.260
hour and not by the pound, and you picked the bowls 
off each stalk of it. put them in a separate sack

17:21.269 --> 17:24.774
because they were working on some genetics 
problem. Then my senior year I was taking a course

17:26.616 --> 17:38.912
in mechanical equipment of buildings under Dr. 
Gieske who was very prominent in the field of

17:26.616 --> 17:38.912
heating, ventilating, air conditioning. And he 
had some curves that he had published in some

17:40.775 --> 17:47.784
paper. He gave us three pence for computing the 
friction head in pipes when you're sizing your hot

17:51.593 --> 18:11.213
water heating systems, and this paper is rather 
old and deteriorated, so one day I made a tracing,

17:51.593 --> 18:11.213
redrew this on tracing cloth and made a bunch of 
blueprints and passed them on among my

17:51.593 --> 18:11.213
classmates. One day Dr. Kiewski saw some student, 
I believe it was George Glover,

18:12.474 --> 18:21.043
using one of these and he wanted to know where he got 
it. And he said, well, Howard Badgett made it. So

18:24.930 --> 18:29.696
his having seen that, he rather liked the work I 
did, I guess. He offered me a job of illustrating

18:29.876 --> 18:36.565
Experiment Station bulletins that he and Mr. E.W. 
Steele, who was head of the Municipal and Sanitary

18:36.585 --> 18:48.600
Engineering Department at the time, and books or 
papers Dr. Gieske had written, asked me to draw the

18:36.585 --> 18:48.600
illustrations from them. So this really led to my

18:49.340 --> 18:56.247
staying with A&M after graduation. Like during my 
senior year, one day Dr. Gieske asked me, would I

18:57.388 --> 19:03.074
like to take graduate work? I said, well, I'd 
always been interested in a lot of courses. Of

19:07.999 --> 19:11.182
course, that was my idea of graduate work then. 
You'd pick out a bunch of courses you liked and

19:11.222 --> 19:14.065
take. So I said, yes. He said he thought he'd give me 
a scholarship, and he did. He got a Portland cement

19:19.251 --> 19:29.906
fellowship that I did my graduate work on in 
research and mechanical equipment of buildings.

19:32.249 --> 19:40.221
And following the completion of that year, well, 
he offered me a job with the Engineering

19:32.249 --> 19:40.221
Experiment Station at A&M.

19:42.985 --> 19:44.327
And you stayed with them for? I stayed with the 
Engineering Experiment Station until I went on

19:44.808 --> 19:53.162
active duty during World War II in October 1940. 
What types of things did you do for the Experiment

19:54.344 --> 19:59.072
Station? We were studying to determine the loss of 
head, the friction head. in new types of fittings

20:08.146 --> 20:12.351
that had come out then. Mueller Rice Company and 
some of the other rice and copper companies had

20:12.511 --> 20:24.224
developed

20:12.511 --> 20:24.224
copper pipe and fittings called sweat fittings. 
Streamline was the trade name. And they had no

20:27.488 --> 20:32.473
known friction head losses for these. We did a lot 
of work in that field. We did work in studying the

20:38.116 --> 20:45.107
comfort zone in air conditioning in conjunction 
with the American Society of Heating and

20:38.116 --> 20:45.107
Ventilating Engineers. They had a comfort zone 
chart which they had prepared up in the north and

20:46.590 --> 20:53.301
the east. This is a combination of temperature, 
humidity, and air movement in which various areas

20:55.324 --> 21:05.220
of people are comfortable in. But they weren't 
sure that this would apply all over the country. So

21:10.267 --> 21:25.325
we set up a laboratory at A&M to make a comparative 
study to see if there was any difference in

21:10.267 --> 21:25.325
people's reaction to various conditions here 
than in the east.

21:29.410 --> 21:34.836
We did quite a bit of work on initial early work on 
what was called panel warming. which had been

21:35.727 --> 21:50.062
developed in England and Germany, where you had 
pipes through your floor at that time, concrete

21:35.727 --> 21:50.062
floors usually, and passed warm water through it 
to get radiant heating. And we did a lot of work in

21:52.144 --> 22:00.553
cast iron fittings. Friction losses were 
computed in those days and we did some actual

22:01.057 --> 22:13.814
experiments to measure the loss of various 
velocities of water flow. We did quite a bit of work

22:16.117 --> 22:30.777
that time also in various methods and phases of 
what is now called waste water treatment,

22:16.117 --> 22:30.777
sewage treatment.

22:34.351 --> 22:44.301
There was, Dr. Gieske, as I said, was a combination

22:34.351 --> 22:44.301
of, his combination included college architect. 
There was not a building or a project on the campus

22:44.321 --> 22:55.012
that he had charge of that didn't include some type 
of experiment in building construction. So

22:55.032 --> 23:01.438
generally we were setting up something of that 
sort, I remember, down in the chemistry building,

23:02.887 --> 23:09.934
the first wing, which was built by the university, 
by the college then, rather than contract work. We

23:09.974 --> 23:18.544
measured the settlement of the building as the 
soil compacted from the weight of the building.

23:20.666 --> 23:30.396
Under the tower, which has since been removed on 
the old Petroleum Geology Building, which

23:20.666 --> 23:30.396
included the Engineering Experiment Station in 
there too, We put soil pressure cells under the

23:31.827 --> 23:43.407
footings of the tower

23:31.827 --> 23:43.407
in order to study the pressure bulb, the 
distribution of pressure under a footing.

23:46.930 --> 23:49.592
In a sense, you made the whole campus a laboratory. 
This is very much the way Dr. Gieske worked. There

23:52.695 --> 24:00.362
wasn't anything he did that wasn't an experiment 
or to prove or disprove some assumption or fact.

24:00.682 --> 24:06.467
Well, in his position as head of the engineering 
experiment station, he was obligated to

24:00.682 --> 24:06.467
experiment. And as college architect, he was 
responsible for all the building construction.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.654
As college architect, did he also design the 
buildings? Oh, yes. He had an architectural

24:17.643 --> 24:37.900
staff, which Phil Norton, an A.M. graduate, was 
his

24:17.643 --> 24:37.900
chief, I won't say engineer, chief architect, but 
he was in charge basically of the day-to-day

24:17.643 --> 24:37.900
operation of the office. And then in the early 30s, 
32, 34, and 5, when we, got a bit of money for

24:48.203 --> 25:08.170
expansion, at which time the Ag Engineering 
Building, the System Administration, the

24:48.203 --> 25:08.170
Petroleum Geology, the Veterinary Science 
Building Group, the Animal Industries Building,

24:48.203 --> 25:08.170
and some others were erected. Rather than farm out 
the work to architects over the country, the board

25:09.191 --> 25:15.780
agreed that the college was set up of its own 
architectural engineering office and at that

25:16.216 --> 25:43.827
time we had we inherited Ross Hall which had been 
condemned my senior year in 1929 as a dormitory

25:16.216 --> 25:43.827
because they thought it was going to fall in and we 
tied it up with a few tie bars through the building

25:16.216 --> 25:43.827
and things and used it for many years thereafter 
but this building was largely architects,

25:43.992 --> 25:48.798
engineers, and other things there who designed 
these buildings. Prior to that, the office

25:49.859 --> 26:05.879
designed the initial stadium, a section of the 
concrete stadium which was erected in about 1930,

25:49.859 --> 26:05.879
I think it started. And Hart Hall, Walton Hall, The 
library, original Cushing Library, was designed

26:11.228 --> 26:17.515
by that office. That was the early office before 
the expansion for the 33 group.

26:25.825 --> 26:27.667
You said the college got a little bit of money. What 
was the source of this money? I think it was the

26:30.691 --> 26:36.638
beginning of the oil money, I believe. That would 
be from the University Available Fund?

26:39.261 --> 26:41.083
University Available Fund. I believe that was the 
source of it. I don't know where they got so much.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.564
You made mention of a 33 group. Well, these were 
designed and built in 1932, 34, and 5. So you had a

26:53.852 --> 26:57.698
half a dozen. You had the System Administration 
Building, the Ag Engineering Building, the

26:57.718 --> 27:09.214
Veterinary Science Group, which is now Civil 
Engineering, the Animal Industries Building,

27:10.493 --> 27:13.156
second wing of the chemistry building.

27:19.322 --> 27:20.103
What else? Well, the library was started in 1929. 
The

27:25.769 --> 27:40.264
library was built on the site of the old chemistry 
building where Dr. Harrington was one of my

27:41.088 --> 27:43.070
freshman chemistry profs. I had my chemistry lab 
there. This was demolished in the summer of 1930. I

27:48.995 --> 28:01.226
remember very well a classmate of mine who had 
difficulty in chemistry and told me he wanted to be

27:48.995 --> 28:01.226
sure and get his brick out of that building because 
he had flunked chemistry one time and he wanted a

27:48.995 --> 28:01.226
brick. So I got him a brick out of that building.

28:16.576 --> 28:18.678
Oh, I know what I was going to say. In capacity of 
designing the buildings that we've just been

28:18.918 --> 28:35.955
talking about, did the college architect's 
office also do, well, I'll call it the decorative

28:18.918 --> 28:35.955
designing for the exterior?

28:38.297 --> 28:39.578
I did the complete building. In the big expansion 
in the early 30s,

28:46.985 --> 29:00.258
architect named Sam Vosper who did the primary 
design and detailed so much of the work

28:46.985 --> 29:00.258
that was done on these buildings. He followed 
largely a lot of the old

29:02.000 --> 29:14.612
architectural styles, but he brought it up to date 
by making these using common things for instance

29:16.162 --> 29:44.093
in the

29:16.162 --> 29:44.093
veterinary science building some of the 
decorative moldings and things were horse heads

29:16.162 --> 29:44.093
or cow heads or pig heads or such as that he tried to 
make in the building in the decoration something

29:16.162 --> 29:44.093
that was indicative of the type of activity was to 
go on in the building. He did all the original work

29:48.251 --> 30:02.253
along with his helpers of course and one of them at 
that time was Elo Urmanoski who has been quite

29:48.251 --> 30:02.253
prominent up at Texas Tech in their landscape 
floor culture department for many years.

30:05.919 --> 30:07.161
They designed system administration building. 
In fact, at that time when we used artificial

30:10.672 --> 30:18.742
stone, the artificial stone was made on the campus 
here. We set up a stone plan around and then one of

30:18.762 --> 30:28.795
the, on the system building, the stone was made 
right about where the Texas flag is now, cast for

30:18.762 --> 30:28.795
that building.
