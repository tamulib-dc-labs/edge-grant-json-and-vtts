00:04.013 --> 00:14.125
This is an interview with Dana Hefner by Margaret 
Hefner on April 15, 1990, in Wharton, Texas,

00:04.013 --> 00:14.125
concerning the topic of the Vietnam War. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge, I'm asking

00:15.206 --> 00:24.057
you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral 
History Collection in the University Archives.

00:24.618 --> 00:25.699
Is this all right with you? Yes, it is. Okay, I'm 
just going to start by asking you a few questions.

00:29.855 --> 00:30.215
All right. What was your specific duty in the Air 
Force, and how did this relate to your perceptions

00:31.436 --> 00:37.882
of the war? Specific duties were munitions 
maintenance with the 431st Munition Maintenance

00:39.524 --> 00:53.878
Squadron,

00:39.524 --> 00:53.878
Tui Wa, Vietnam, Republic of Vietnam. Our 
specific duties were... the production of

00:56.630 --> 01:11.096
munitions from 22 caliber small arms to 250 to 750 
pound bombs, napalm and HE.

01:13.981 --> 01:19.110
We flew support missions for ground support 
troops.

01:24.457 --> 01:30.464
We flew very few missions, if any, into North 
Vietnam. All was done in South Vietnam for support

01:30.724 --> 01:33.748
of the troops.

01:36.851 --> 01:42.698
Okay, and when did you join the Air Force, or did you 
volunteer? After high school, I went to Del Mar

01:42.758 --> 01:52.029
Tech in Corpus Christi for a short period. The 
draft was real heavy. And I figured I would get into

01:54.460 --> 02:00.930
the Air Force rather than going to the Army, where 
possibly I could get a further education. This was

02:02.973 --> 02:06.839
in the latter part of 65 and early 66.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.368
When were you in Vietnam? What specific, okay, you 
just said. The specific dates in Vietnam was from

02:15.452 --> 02:23.083
around

02:15.452 --> 02:23.083
Easter. Of 68 to 79, give or take 30 days would 
accumulate a year. Okay, and when were you there?

02:37.591 --> 02:38.132
68 and 69. 68, okay. Okay, can you describe the 
countryside and the village and the base at which

02:40.916 --> 02:48.750
you were stationed in Vietnam? Tuliwala was a 
brand new Air Force base when I got there. In fact,

02:52.554 --> 02:54.216
it hadn't been completed. We were right on the 
beach of the South China Sea, about 165 miles south

02:56.500 --> 03:03.390
of Da Nang.

03:07.015 --> 03:15.007
We were bordered on the other side by a mountainous 
area and some jungle with villages on the outlying

03:07.015 --> 03:15.007
perimeter. Approximately...

03:19.882 --> 03:25.950
12 to 14 miles from the city of Tui Wah, which is a 
Providence capital.

03:29.275 --> 03:35.504
To what extent and in what ways did you interact 
with the Vietnamese people? I had very little

03:35.524 --> 03:42.513
dealings with the civilian population as a whole. 
We did employ civilians. to work in the munitions

03:46.628 --> 03:50.553
area and on base. We used them quite a bit in our 
crews for the building of bombs and rockets and the

03:50.914 --> 04:09.480
assembly of 20 millimeter and 7.62

03:50.914 --> 04:09.480
munitions fire.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.847
How were the Vietnamese people and their culture 
viewed by Americans in the Air Force? or people

04:15.400 --> 04:18.425
you're around? I'm not real sure about other 
people. I viewed their customs and their

04:20.989 --> 04:27.900
traditions as very odd. Never being in an Asian 
country, I'd never been around Asians. And they

04:36.473 --> 04:39.618
did some funny things. In fact, we used to laugh a 
lot when it came time for a child, they would wash

04:43.666 --> 04:52.276
their feet over preference of washing their 
hands, which I thought was really funny.

04:56.821 --> 04:57.482
Okay. How do you think, from your experience, the 
Vietnamese viewed American soldiers and the

04:58.583 --> 05:04.591
American people?

05:08.615 --> 05:13.521
I believe that the majority of the Vietnamese that 
I encountered were very supportive and very glad

05:13.990 --> 05:23.842
to have the Americans there.

05:24.262 --> 05:30.990
They seemed to want their freedom and expected the 
Americans to help them obtain it. But you know,

05:32.332 --> 05:39.240
there's that minority that we find all over the 
world. They were very skeptical.

05:46.188 --> 05:50.154
And what was an average daily routine for you in 
Vietnam? An average daily routine? We split up on

05:52.498 --> 06:13.191
shifts where a month at a time we would work nights, 
usually go to work around 6 o'clock, and get off

05:52.498 --> 06:13.191
anywhere from 6 to 7 in the morning, which we 
enjoyed the night shift because it was so much

05:52.498 --> 06:13.191
cooler. And our day shifts were from around 7 to 7,

06:14.352 --> 06:23.641
with elapsing for child time. A little time off 
every

06:25.643 --> 06:30.127
night. In what way did you see a war change after the 
Tet Offensive was launched on January 31, 1968? I

06:40.156 --> 06:43.279
saw a larger movement. of North Vietnamese moving 
into the country, and they were being supported

06:43.580 --> 07:00.839
very well

06:43.580 --> 07:00.839
by communist countries from the weapons that were 
captured.

07:02.080 --> 07:10.549
There was a demoralization of the American troops 
somewhat after the Tet Offensive. because of the

07:11.525 --> 07:18.758
step up and the build up of the numbers of people. 
Really, as far as politically wise, I didn't see

07:18.778 --> 07:26.693
any change in it. Okay. The base that you were 
stationed, was that the base of the TAC during Tet?

07:32.063 --> 07:34.327
Or you were there at that point? No, I was not. Okay. 
How was President Johnson and his policy of

07:36.803 --> 07:44.393
escalation viewed by Americans in Vietnam?

07:47.537 --> 07:50.782
I think as a whole the American G.I. viewed 
President Johnson's stand in Vietnam as a

07:52.925 --> 08:04.380
patriotic duty.

08:05.558 --> 08:14.950
Our feelings were that we were over there to 
overthrow communist rule to a sovereign

08:05.558 --> 08:14.950
government. And we believed that our president 
was trying to do that.

08:22.719 --> 08:27.525
What aspects of careerism in the military did you 
encounter? Did you ever see any of that?

08:32.091 --> 08:34.013
No, not really. What was the morale like among the 
Americans in Vietnam, like pre and post Tet?

08:46.221 --> 08:51.027
Morale fluctuated quite a bit the whole period I 
was there. It was always up and down. I couldn't see

08:54.991 --> 08:58.976
where the Tet had anything to do with it. It seemed 
to me like it was a day-to-day struggle. to

09:04.233 --> 09:14.983
accomplish a job that we were sent there for and in 
hopes to get it done within the period of a year

09:04.233 --> 09:14.983
while you're there and get home.

09:19.027 --> 09:27.756
What was the general attitude of Americans toward 
their commanding officers and duties, and how was

09:19.027 --> 09:27.756
this exemplified? I think that in my squadron, We 
were very supportive of our commanding officers.

09:38.895 --> 09:50.408
Accommodation medals were given out for just 
about everybody that was there in the 431st

09:38.895 --> 09:50.408
Munition Maintenance Squadron while I was over 
there.

09:53.851 --> 10:02.100
Our commanding officers were very sympathetic of 
the conditions we were living under and the

09:53.851 --> 10:02.100
stress.

10:03.312 --> 10:10.659
It was exemplified by our actions in our 
profession. Did you see many GI dissidents when

10:10.680 --> 10:13.923
you were there? No, I didn't.

10:18.648 --> 10:19.228
Okay. In what way or by what means do you think the 
war could have been won if you felt like the war

10:19.248 --> 10:30.099
could have been won? And how do you feel like that 
could be accomplished? I think that there was so

10:34.902 --> 10:45.377
many limitations placed upon the American 
soldiers and the Allied soldiers that were over

10:34.902 --> 10:45.377
there. The Vietnamese and the Viet Cong had no 
boundaries. They crossed at will into Cambodia.

11:03.424 --> 11:04.285
Whereas the GIs and the Allied forces had boundary 
lines. And the Vietnamese fought a guerrilla

11:08.941 --> 11:13.468
warfare.

11:17.413 --> 11:23.702
You take, for instance, somebody coming into your 
country, and you know your homeland. Go up in the

11:25.344 --> 11:26.646
Smoky Mountains. These people that live there can 
run and hide for months on end. They strike And

11:35.197 --> 11:37.440
there's no way to strike back. And I believe the 
limitations that was put on the American soldier

11:38.922 --> 11:50.359
and the allied forces that were there was a 
tremendous problem. This was probably the

11:52.362 --> 11:57.108
biggest morale falter that there was. It was way 
too many limitations. And I believe the war could

12:02.176 --> 12:03.938
have been won if some of these limitations would 
have been lifted.

12:10.516 --> 12:11.637
What type of limitations do you mean? Well, like I 
say, there are boundaries, for instance. We were

12:17.303 --> 12:19.966
not allowed to go into Cambodia. We were not 
allowed to go into any of the Laotian countries.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.617
Or we were not supposed to. And I think that this 
restricted our own power.

12:39.196 --> 12:43.780
I think that the American fighting man is probably 
the best trained. And

12:45.782 --> 13:01.397
probably the highest credit that can be given to 
him is fighting in this country with the

12:45.782 --> 13:01.397
limitations that was forced on him.

13:02.862 --> 13:12.491
How did you and others in Vietnam cope with death, 
frustration, fear, and boredom? A lot of it was

13:13.953 --> 13:21.400
making up jokes, finding things to do that we found 
humorous. For a while, we were stenciling bombs

13:23.141 --> 13:31.249
and such that we were sending to a flight line to be 
flown in sorties. with stenciled little slogans

13:31.837 --> 13:54.695
like this is a Charlie's cook stove on a napalm 
bomb, or Ho Chi Minh's a Quaker, or turtle mating

13:31.837 --> 13:54.695
season from April 19th to March 32nd, and things 
like this. We did have...

13:59.090 --> 14:05.660
We did have town leave that we could take, which I 
didn't find necessary. But we had several open air

14:06.922 --> 14:17.277
movies on base if you weren't too tired to go. And we 
drank a lot of hooch.

14:24.824 --> 14:31.273
What was something that you were commanded to do 
that you found extremely emotionally difficult

14:24.824 --> 14:31.273
to cope? Being in a war zone,

14:32.996 --> 14:49.840
I found it unbearable to think that the base 
cleanliness was such a priority.

14:50.001 --> 14:53.025
Like I say, being right on the South China Sea The 
whole compound was sand. And there was grass seed

14:57.368 --> 15:05.460
thrown in from the United States to be planted in 
the sand. Well, with the shifting winds and the

15:05.480 --> 15:15.816
tides and the torrential rains, the seed never had 
a chance to even sprout. So when this was

15:15.836 --> 15:20.042
squelched, They decided that instead of trying to 
grow grass, that we would rake the sand and keep it

15:20.613 --> 15:28.083
nice and level. Another thing was pulling KP. Many 
times we had to pull KP and still work a 12-hour

15:33.951 --> 15:41.762
shift. And like I say, we did employ Vietnamese 
civilians on base that could have worked KP.

15:51.038 --> 15:54.404
Instead it was sold. So it was very difficult to put 
up with such nonsense. Now, and what exactly, what

16:00.454 --> 16:05.161
exactly is KP? That is kitchen potholes. Oh. 
That's where you go in and peel potatoes or wash

16:07.104 --> 16:14.717
dishes and straighten up mess off.

16:17.448 --> 16:23.816
What type of response did you receive from the 
American public as a whole when you came back from

16:17.448 --> 16:23.816
Vietnam? As a whole, I felt the American public was 
very offish. I think the American public was

16:31.104 --> 16:38.033
told things that weren't true.

16:43.239 --> 16:46.763
Very, very, very few times did I ever have anyone 
congratulate me for the effort that I put while I

16:47.384 --> 16:51.889
was over there. Most of the time they would add, oh, 
you were in Vietnam and let it go at that. My family

16:59.018 --> 17:00.720
was very supportive.

17:04.084 --> 17:14.016
My nieces, nephews,

17:04.084 --> 17:14.016
my mother, my father, all my brothers and sisters, 
aunts and uncles. But as a whole, the general

17:15.127 --> 17:17.570
public was very bold.

17:21.896 --> 17:31.909
How has your perception of patriotism and service 
to your country changed after Vietnam, and why

17:21.896 --> 17:31.909
did it change? If it changed at all, I believe I 
became more patriotic. I think that being in a

17:37.195 --> 17:44.745
country such as Vietnam and seeing the tragedies 
and of people being so suppressed that my

17:45.890 --> 17:54.821
patriotism grew deeper. I would never, I would 
never ever want to see my children or any

17:56.503 --> 18:12.522
descendants of this country have to face what 
those people in Vietnam

17:56.503 --> 18:12.522
did. In your opinion, what were some major 
military mistakes that could have

18:14.408 --> 18:29.663
been avoided? I'm not a military leader, and I 
never claimed to be.

18:38.932 --> 18:41.935
There's mistakes made in every conflict or war. 
And if they could have been avoided, I believe they

18:43.940 --> 18:48.465
would have. Everybody is doing mistakes. And 
hopefully, if we ever have to go to another country

18:53.952 --> 19:11.432
to support what we believe in, in democracy, that 
those mistakes could be corrected, if there was

18:53.952 --> 19:11.432
any mistakes made.

19:14.264 --> 19:24.398
I feel that some of the rules could have been 
changed to help support the military personnel

19:14.264 --> 19:24.398
that was over there, not only the United States. We 
had South Koreans there, and we had Australians,

19:25.159 --> 19:38.196
and these people fought hard.

19:38.851 --> 19:56.247
In what way did your experience affect your 
attitude, beliefs, and actions when it was time to

19:38.851 --> 19:56.247
carry on an ordinary life in the States?

19:56.267 --> 20:08.318
Probably when I came back, what I mostly thought of 
was

19:56.267 --> 20:08.318
classes of people that are in our country. whether 
it be for economic reasons or educational

20:08.720 --> 20:16.509
reasons. I would love to see this corrected,

20:16.530 --> 20:29.686
if at all possible.

20:29.886 --> 20:37.495
Any time a person is suppressed, it not only 
affects themselves and their immediate family,

20:37.964 --> 20:45.396
but it affects all people.

20:46.899 --> 20:55.192
If you had to tell someone of the AIDS generation 
anything that you learned from your experience in

20:46.899 --> 20:55.192
Vietnam, what would it be?

21:02.324 --> 21:04.107
To always keep the attitude. That no matter how 
much freedom you do have, that you can lose it. And

21:13.189 --> 21:21.181
that you would always stay on your toes and stay 
abreast of everything that is going on.

21:24.145 --> 21:29.593
Never, never ever give up your freedom.

21:29.613 --> 21:31.075
Okay, well thank you very much, Dana. Certainly.
