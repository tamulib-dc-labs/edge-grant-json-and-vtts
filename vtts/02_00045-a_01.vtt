Testing, testing, testing. January 21, testing, 
testing.

00:12.883 --> 00:14.126
2-2-2. January 21, testing, 2-2-2.

00:21.277 --> 00:35.433
This is Friday, the 21st of January, I believe, 
sitting in the office with David Brooks Cofer,

00:21.277 --> 00:35.433
Jr., known by everybody here in town as just 
Brooks, I believe. And then test yours, sir. All

00:38.096 --> 00:38.656
right, sir. That's correct. Here we are. All 
right.

00:46.204 --> 00:51.250
Normally when we begin these, I ask people to give a 
brief biographical summary. But in this case,

00:51.871 --> 01:02.984
because you grew up on the campus, I hope that our 
interview will concentrate on your growing up in

00:51.871 --> 01:02.984
the campus community. Let's begin by your 
recording on this machine for us, your

01:03.885 --> 01:18.743
recollections of your parents' background 
before they came to College Station. Where did

01:18.783 --> 01:21.186
they grow up and where did they live? because we 
want to get as much information we can about them on

01:21.166 --> 01:24.872
this tape. All right, sir. My father was a native 
Kentuckian, born in 1886, graduated

01:26.855 --> 01:50.110
from Center College at Danville, and then took a 
teaching job at a small school in Missouri, and

01:26.855 --> 01:50.110
then also another year teaching in Arkansas. and 
got the opportunity to come to Texas A&M in 1909,

01:50.528 --> 02:00.801
and he reported for the 1910 session. And of 
course, when he came, the problem of girls on the

02:02.042 --> 02:12.456
campus at A&M, he recognized that. And his 
introduction to society, I guess, was to the Bryan

02:13.737 --> 02:19.945
400. of which my mother was a member. She was Sarah 
Nancy Allen, the daughter of Mr. John Hodges

02:24.059 --> 02:33.511
Allen, the founder of Allen Academy. So she was a 
native. At that time, I think Allen Academy had

02:35.914 --> 02:44.065
been in Bryan for something like 20

02:35.914 --> 02:44.065
years or something. I don't know. And so they met 
and became... known to each other, and finally

02:49.439 --> 02:52.061
married in 1917. Shortly thereafter, or the next 
year, I believe, my sister was born, and Papa and

02:52.142 --> 03:09.678
Mimi, that I called, were living on a campus at 125 
Wood Street. And then I came along in 1922, born in

03:10.279 --> 03:17.826
an old four-apartment house on the corner across 
from the Duncan home and catty corner from Walton

03:18.262 --> 03:30.765
Hall, which is approximately before you get to the 
North Gate area off of the campus. 125 Wood Street

03:31.747 --> 03:39.662
was just two doors down on the same street in front 
of what is now called the Dixie Chicken. Oh, that's

03:40.081 --> 03:43.425
a fast background. But the apartment building 
where you were born was on the north side of, was it

03:43.565 --> 03:51.775
on the campus? It was on the campus. Oh, opposite 
where the Dixie Chicken is today. Very close, you

03:57.022 --> 04:04.030
see, to the Northgate area and right across from 
the Duncan home that I knew. who was the manager of

04:04.482 --> 04:06.406
the mess hall. Back up in that, you mentioned the 
400 in Bryan. Well, that's what they've always

04:12.977 --> 04:16.384
been known as. Even in my days going through high 
school and going through A&M, the local girls were

04:16.504 --> 04:25.360
known as the Bryan 400s. Now, they varied from time 
to time due to the ages and the classes that they

04:25.610 --> 04:31.558
would go with at A&M. So if you were known as going 
with the Bryan 400, that was one of the local girls.

04:38.749 --> 04:38.949
All right. Was any local girl in the 400, or was that 
supposedly a status symbol? That was just a

04:44.477 --> 04:46.660
conglomerate. I mean, that was just what they 
called them. My sister was in that because she was

04:49.885 --> 04:54.351
College Station Bryan. And they were known on the 
campus as the Bryan 400. Can you recall and

05:01.092 --> 05:10.925
describe anything you remember having heard 
about how your dad linked up with A&M? How did he and

05:10.985 --> 05:15.170
A&M know there was a possibility of his coming 
here? As I understand it, his degree was in Latin.

05:26.528 --> 05:36.641
And

05:26.528 --> 05:36.641
he ended up an English teacher, but he came as a 
Latin teacher, but he taught English. Now, I can

05:37.342 --> 05:41.687
only, I can look in a file that I have. I do have the 
letter of his offer to come, and I'll be glad to show

05:42.568 --> 05:49.918
you that off the record, you know, if you'd like to 
see that. And he came, and as I recall it, it was...

05:55.570 --> 05:58.635
He was offered a position for nine months at 
$1,000. And so at that time, historically, I think

05:58.956 --> 06:13.360
there was a recession shortly after he got out of 
college, and that was a golden opportunity. Now,

06:13.407 --> 06:22.436
his graduate work after center college was... Was 
at Wisconsin and Chicago. He got his master's

06:22.516 --> 06:25.539
degree at the University of Wisconsin. Okay. He 
didn't have a doctoral degree, or did he? No, sir,

06:29.543 --> 06:32.146
he did not have a doctoral degree. And he came, I 
assume, on the railroad. Have you heard any

06:36.310 --> 06:40.714
descriptions of what he brought with him? Was it 
more than a suitcase? In those days, travelers had

06:43.477 --> 06:46.341
trunks. And I know he had a trunk because it stayed 
in the household for years and years after that.

06:54.190 --> 07:09.688
But he came in a trunk, and of course, when he 
arrived at College Station, I've never heard him

06:54.190 --> 07:09.688
say much about it, but they had what they called the 
Shirley Hotel, which was a bachelor club order

07:10.428 --> 07:15.935
where single instructors could stay. And I think 
that's where he first stayed. And that was

07:19.840 --> 07:28.170
located, I think, close to the Aggieland Inn, 
which doesn't exist, but in that same area. That'd

07:28.831 --> 07:34.157
be kind of west of where the old Northgate Post 
Office is now. It would be south towards, well, not

07:34.812 --> 07:40.538
far from the president's home. You're right. The 
one that burned. The one that burned in that area, I

07:42.399 --> 07:46.023
think is where it was. All right. And so he teaches 
here then beginning in 1910

07:47.784 --> 07:55.512
for the rest of his active career. That's true. And 
he retired in 1957. 1957. As an archivist, that was

08:01.627 --> 08:06.414
his final position at A&M. As far as you are aware, 
what course or courses did he most enjoy teaching?

08:13.905 --> 08:21.416
Well, in those days, the English department was 
more or less, I don't know what academically they

08:13.905 --> 08:21.416
call it. It was just a coincidental department for 
the study of agriculture and engineering. And at

08:29.993 --> 08:34.641
that time, they had freshman English and they had 
sophomore English. And then for the more advanced

08:35.222 --> 08:44.618
classes, they had report writing, public 
speaking, you see. Well, that's all changed now.

08:46.060 --> 08:54.094
But he was sophomore literature and sophomore 
English, I guess, were his main courses. Did you

08:54.918 --> 09:00.304
ever hear him express his feelings about A&M and 
A&M students? Well, he was quite known, I think, by

09:01.906 --> 09:11.116
the former students who would come back and make 
contact with him. And he got a great deal of

09:11.156 --> 09:20.487
pleasure out of hearing from them when he became 
the archivist, because they would know about the

09:11.156 --> 09:20.487
old times and they would contact him and express 
appreciation for what he was doing, trying to

09:21.040 --> 09:27.831
collect some history about the university. And 
they also assisted him because at that time the

09:28.092 --> 09:39.010
archivist was underwritten more by the 
association of former students than it was the

09:28.092 --> 09:39.010
university. So he had a great deal of contact with 
his former students like Mr. J. Harold Dunn, who

09:46.387 --> 09:56.279
was on the board, as I recall, was one of them that he 
had a lot of contact with, and others. Let me throw

09:57.640 --> 10:02.066
in an anecdote on J. Harold Dunn to get it recorded. 
I happened to be the master of ceremonies when the

10:03.107 --> 10:15.702
Kruger Dunn dormitory complex was dedicated, and 
I learned that Mr. Dunn's wife had grown up in a

10:03.107 --> 10:15.702
little town named Garland. where I lived until I 
was 10 and where my parents grew up. And her name, if

10:20.691 --> 10:24.477
I'm not mistaken, her maiden name was Louise 
McCollum. And I asked my dad if he had known a girl

10:25.278 --> 10:29.103
with that name. He was sure. She was almost related 
to us, you know, kind of second cousin once removed

10:29.885 --> 10:35.132
sort of. I said, whatever happened to her dad? He 
said, well, we kind of lost touch. She married some

10:39.439 --> 10:43.244
little bitty guy and he went off to somewhere up in 
the panhandle. I never heard of anything that he

10:43.264 --> 10:45.267
ever did. And I said, well, let me tell you what Mr. 
J. Harold Dunn accomplished with the founding of

10:45.770 --> 10:53.057
what is now Shamrock Oil. He did OK. Let's see. Your 
dad was not the first archivist, was he? Was either

11:02.165 --> 11:06.950
Papa Oz or Mr. Ernest Langford. Oh, no, he precedes 
Mr. So your dad was. I believe he was, yes. But Mr.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.472
Lankford did a very good job, too. Oh, you bet. As 
your memory begins, where did the English

11:18.157 --> 11:26.560
department office, where were... Third floor of 
the academic building. Not the, well, that was the

11:27.400 --> 11:31.605
building, the academic building is the building 
with the dome, you see. Yes, yes. The

11:32.165 --> 11:35.790
administration building is further east, so 
built in the 30s. But it was on the third floor of the

11:36.410 --> 11:39.534
academic building. All right, now let's start 
with your memories. You said you were born. Of

11:44.980 --> 11:47.162
course, they tell me that, you see. I guess my early 
memories begin when I was going to A&M

11:48.063 --> 11:56.513
Consolidated School. It was a stucco building on 
the campus that later became a music hall, and it

11:57.269 --> 12:14.145
was right at the end of the Joe Routt Boulevard to 
the east. There was a two-story stucco building

12:14.165 --> 12:16.647
there. And immediately behind us was the pastures 
for the Animal Industries Department, and I went

12:27.458 --> 12:29.921
to first grade through seventh grade there. And 
then from the seventh grade, we went to high

12:30.422 --> 12:34.627
school. We had no middle school, but we went up 
towards the academic building in an old dormitory

12:34.667 --> 12:42.977
called Pfeiffer Hall. Pfeiffer Hall was between 
the academic building and the physics building.

12:48.604 --> 12:52.409
So we were given that location for the high school. 
And I attended there. and finished in 1939, then

12:55.522 --> 12:58.745
went to A&M. But the early recollections would be 
in grammar school there at, well, the old A&M

12:58.805 --> 13:09.056
Consolidated High School, I mean school. As far as 
you recall, about how many first graders were

13:09.276 --> 13:14.441
there when you were a first grader? Was it one room 
or two rooms? A&M Consolidated at that time, had

13:22.167 --> 13:26.854
students coming from the rural communities, like 
Wellborn. And then down close to Wellborn was Men

13:28.416 --> 13:32.182
of Springs. They came from all over. That's why it 
was consolidated. But in our class, we'd have 25

13:37.309 --> 13:42.076
students. So was there one teacher full-time for 
the first grade? That's correct. And her name was

13:49.927 --> 13:53.612
Ms. Fred L. Sloop. S-L-O-O-P. S-L-O-O-P. Was she, 
by chance, a faculty wife? No. I think her husband,

14:01.462 --> 14:10.974
as best I recall, was a teacher in the Bryan school 
system. And she taught out at Consolidated and was

14:10.994 --> 14:18.904
known for the Sloop method of... learning to read. 
It was a phonetic system. And that's what she was

14:24.724 --> 14:27.128
famous for. Now, of your, of those years that you 
were in first through 11 grades, for someone your

14:28.570 --> 14:44.075
and my age, we weren't in 12th grade system yet, 
about what percentage were faculty kids, faculty

14:28.570 --> 14:44.075
and staff kids? Half.

14:48.162 --> 14:52.707
I would say that's a fair estimate. Of course, you 
know, they weren't maybe from the faculty homes,

14:53.148 --> 15:08.485
but there were a lot of auxiliary homes and 
families that were connected with the college,

14:53.148 --> 15:08.485
like the Building and Grounds Department. They 
provided any number of houses on the campus for

15:13.340 --> 15:34.464
those positions, like the head of the power plant, 
Mr. Mousner, had children going to, and the other

15:13.340 --> 15:34.464
employees of the buildings and ground department 
had children that also went, you see. So there were

15:34.984 --> 15:38.368
any number, but a great deal of them came from the 
rural outlying areas. Now, as your memory begins,

15:44.448 --> 15:49.094
kindergarten or first grade? No kindergarten. We 
went to the first grade, no kindergarten. Where

15:54.722 --> 15:57.025
did you all live as your first grader? We lived at 
125 Wood Street, which was right in front of Walton

15:58.506 --> 16:03.393
Hall. And I would walk to school. And I would come 
home at lunch for a noon meal and go back to school

16:07.947 --> 16:17.121
walking and then come home in the afternoon. What 
did you and your friends do for fun? For fun.

16:21.567 --> 16:24.472
Describe the play activities of youngsters. 
Well, we had to make up fun sometimes. Like I

16:29.379 --> 16:33.465
remember in the summer time, Our next door 
neighbor was Mr. J.W. Mitchell in the math

16:36.269 --> 16:38.432
department. And he was a great entertainer, but he 
also would set up a game of washers where we could

16:39.413 --> 17:03.148
participate and we would challenge each other and 
then we would pass the cup around as each victor was

16:39.413 --> 17:03.148
determined. And I remember joining with me in that 
activity was John Sancet, who lived just down

17:03.517 --> 17:14.392
below us in what we call the pecan orchard. His 
father was in the CE department. And in the

17:18.498 --> 17:21.222
summertime, while we would have these washer 
matches and challenge each other and then let Mr.

17:22.518 --> 17:29.989
Mitchell also participate in it with us. Now we had 
a great deal of time, fun doing that. I remember

17:34.935 --> 17:50.938
John was able to drive sooner than I was able to 
drive and his family had a car and on some Saturday

17:34.935 --> 17:50.938
afternoons while we would take 25 to 50 cents to go 
to town to see the movies. But there was always

17:51.965 --> 17:58.027
something that if it weren't organized that we 
would find time to do. Who were, in elementary

17:58.809 --> 18:02.683
school, who were your closest friends? I guess the 
closest friend that our family had was the C.B.

18:08.510 --> 18:09.612
Camel family. Dr. Camel was taught modern 
languages, and he was my age, and we went to the same

18:23.183 --> 18:29.373
Union Sunday School in the bottom of Gahn Hall, and 
naturally we went to a consolidated school. And

18:30.815 --> 18:45.078
his sister was the same age as my older sister, so we 
were families and were always very familiar with

18:30.815 --> 18:45.078
them. They lived on the south side of the campus off 
of the drill field between the

18:49.154 --> 19:01.467
road to the old post office and Kyle Field. There's 
a block there of campus housing. And they lived in

19:06.552 --> 19:16.303
that area and in the back of them were the tennis 
courts that they were built for the students. So I

19:16.323 --> 19:18.385
would say that

19:21.335 --> 19:21.856
C.B. Campbell, Jr., F.W. Hensel, Jr., who lived 
just up the street from him, was a little older than

19:24.418 --> 19:31.045
we were. But in my particular age group, there was 
Margaret Ann Williams, Dr. D.W. Williams'

19:32.286 --> 19:39.534
daughter. Then there was Lucille Thornton, who 
married Allen Maidley and lived around the corner

19:41.115 --> 19:48.743
from them. Virginia Jones lived on the same block 
there. And then the Winklers lived not far around

19:53.366 --> 19:57.871
the corner. We were all a group that went through 
grade school together and high school. What were

20:06.539 --> 20:17.110
the social activities of your parents and their 
friends, what were their social activities on the

20:06.539 --> 20:17.110
campus or in the neighborhood? I guess the main 
social activity was in the summertime when you

20:18.085 --> 20:28.420
would be sitting out on the lawn, somebody would 
walk by and come in and visit with you. We didn't

20:29.342 --> 20:37.474
have air conditioning in those days, but that was 
the way to kind of cool off before nightfall. And

20:38.395 --> 20:41.680
Mr. A. Mitchell around the corner or anybody, Mr. 
Marburger. Mr. Marburger was the greatest

20:44.557 --> 20:48.581
storyteller that ever hit A&M campus. And he was 
head of the buildings and grounds. And it was

20:52.265 --> 20:55.829
really fun to listen to the stories that he would 
tell. I can't remember, but he was a great

20:56.629 --> 20:59.252
storyteller. Did these stories have any common 
theme? They were just stories of his activity and

21:03.857 --> 21:08.061
experiences that he had. But he was a great 
storyteller. His daughter Billy May Marburger,

21:13.098 --> 21:17.906
oh, now, what can I think of? Still lives around. 
And she lived, they lived over not far from the

21:22.633 --> 21:37.637
entrance to Kyle Field, in that other block, 
immediately where the MSC is now, in that block.

21:38.528 --> 21:43.034
That was solid campus housing in those days. And 
they lived there.

21:48.883 --> 21:54.972
But I can remember it was always funny and 
enjoyable for me to sit and listen to those

21:48.883 --> 21:54.972
stories.

21:59.418 --> 22:02.162
They had a faculty club, as I recall. They had 
dinners every so often. And I think they may have

22:08.583 --> 22:18.457
had faculty dances in the mess hall, but I don't 
think my parents participated much. What about

22:18.477 --> 22:23.104
bridge clubs? They had a bridge club, the Little 
Bridge Club, they called it, that was made up of 12

22:23.224 --> 22:30.214
ladies. And as I recall, they didn't play for 
points. But, well, they did play for points, but

22:37.338 --> 22:53.742
they wouldn't play for any kind of nickel or dime on 
the side, but they would figure it up at the end of

22:37.338 --> 22:53.742
the season who was the winner and so forth, and 
they'd pass the book to that person or something,

22:37.338 --> 22:53.742
as I recall. But in that membership were Mrs. 
Camel, Mrs. Hensel, Mrs. Emmy Marstella, Mrs.

23:04.608 --> 23:17.015
Ruth Harrington was a member, and Mrs. Echols was a 
member, and Mrs. Abbott,

23:04.608 --> 23:17.015
my mother, and they had 12. And if they had a 
vacancy, there was a selection process, you know,

23:17.937 --> 23:24.912
that they had to meet the approval. Were there any 
unwritten rules about social life? For example,

23:31.029 --> 23:39.100
could you serve alcoholic beverages at a private 
party? You know, I don't recall our ever having

23:40.703 --> 23:50.697
that at home when we lived on the campus. But as I 
recall, it was more or less non-alcoholic.

23:58.274 --> 24:00.117
And also, did the men ever play poker? I don't 
recall. I'm sure they must have had. I know the

24:04.185 --> 24:06.409
students had poker games. But you don't remember? 
But I don't know whether the faculty, but I can

24:07.331 --> 24:11.098
imagine some of them, sometime had some 
gatherings. Fred Benson once told me a long time

24:16.205 --> 24:26.755
ago that one of the unwritten rules when he first 
arrived here he thought was never get involved in a

24:16.205 --> 24:26.755
divorce. If you have a divorce then resign and go 
somewhere else. I think that may have been the rule

24:31.219 --> 24:33.982
of thumb. And he also said that one of the unwritten 
rules that he understood was never serve wine or

24:40.357 --> 24:46.724
any other alcoholic beverage with the curtains 
open. Yes. I think that's right. The only time you

24:47.485 --> 25:05.925
saw any kind of alcohol was at a football game, 
because they would be out-of-town spectators

24:47.485 --> 25:05.925
that would come in, and they would come from 
Houston, Dallas, Austin, so forth, and they

24:47.485 --> 25:05.925
brought their own. And I remember when I would go 
through the

25:06.563 --> 25:17.455
stadium after a ball game, you could see the effect 
of there.

25:20.658 --> 25:21.079
Let's see. Back to your days as a youngster, did you 
and your buddies ever attempt any pranks on campus

25:22.300 --> 25:32.771
when you were in elementary or high school? Pranks 
were played on us. we'd have tricycles or wagons

25:37.394 --> 25:42.681
that would be in the front yard. And then on April 
Fool's Day, we would find them perched up in the

25:42.762 --> 25:49.731
live oak trees in the front yard. And they were put 
there by, we know, students

25:49.911 --> 25:58.363
looking for a prank to play. But that happened all 
the time. Of course, the students, everything

26:00.867 --> 26:06.034
revolved around campus life, I mean, and the 
students were the main,

26:06.115 --> 26:16.204
well, they were the main source of fun or 
entertainment that you could have. They had All

26:16.244 --> 26:25.412
Fools Day on April the 1st, where they would dress 
up and go to class in really outrageous costumes.

26:27.234 --> 26:34.941
But that was a custom that I think ended during 
Colonel Moore's tenure as commandant. And I think

26:36.440 --> 26:48.055
it terminated when he said, all right, we will have 
a review of a cadet corps at 11 AM. And at 1 o'clock,

26:48.216 --> 26:50.899
you'll be back in uniform. And that was the end of 
it. Now, when that happened, it must have been in

26:52.982 --> 26:56.787
the middle 30s sometime. For you as a youngster 
before you are an A&M student, there must have been

27:03.473 --> 27:17.791
some kind of no-nos that you and your buddies knew, 
like did you all would not walk down the hallway of

27:03.473 --> 27:17.791
an A&M academic building while classes were 
underway, I presume, and that sort of thing. No,

27:18.211 --> 27:27.383
that was the only limitation that I knew about was 
that I was never given permission to go in the

27:18.211 --> 27:27.383
dormitory. Oh, okay. I could never go into the 
dormitory. And... There was quite an occasion

27:33.038 --> 27:49.245
when school was out, when the term was out, that 
various people would go in and see what could be

27:33.038 --> 27:49.245
salvaged from what was thrown away by the students 
who had left. But the only thing that was really of

27:49.265 --> 27:59.181
any value made was the coat hangers that they had to 
take back over to the North Gate Cleaners to get

27:49.265 --> 27:59.181
some little compensation. So you don't remember 
any treasure that somebody found? I do not recall

28:03.653 --> 28:04.955
any. Let's see, you must have had a bicycle. When 
did you get a bicycle? I had a bicycle, and I can, you

28:10.163 --> 28:24.364
know, I remember, it's just like getting the 
scratch on, the first scratch you get on your new

28:10.163 --> 28:24.364
car, you're going to have some spokes that get 
broken in a bicycle. And at that time, Well, at a

28:28.372 --> 28:38.363
later time in high school, it was, I was able to be 
the special delivery messenger for the United

28:28.372 --> 28:38.363
States Post Office. The special delivery letters 
would come in, and you would then deliver them at

28:39.044 --> 28:44.771
nine cents a letter. And I used my bicycle to 
deliver those around the campus to students and to

28:46.312 --> 28:52.800
the offices. That was during the summer months. 
And at that time, the post office was a very small

28:56.924 --> 29:07.845
building close to where the Grove is now. At the end 
of a street coming down from the MSC, there was a

29:08.990 --> 29:18.539
post office building there. And of course, the 
later one was at the north gate. So that old post

29:22.503 --> 29:27.147
office was not very far from the college station. 
It was on the railroad. It appeared to be on the

29:29.409 --> 29:34.254
railroad right of way of the Missouri Pacific. The 
Missouri Pacific was closer to the campus than the

29:34.294 --> 29:37.917
Southern Pacific. was west, but they paralleled 
each other. With your special delivery duties,

29:42.779 --> 29:48.987
what would have been the normal number of special 
delivery letters? It depended upon the time. If

29:52.432 --> 30:04.208
somebody wanted to come to A&M and was late towards 
the end of the summer, they were getting in

29:52.432 --> 30:04.208
transcripts to the registrar's office. So I would 
have any number of deliveries there. Sometimes

30:08.568 --> 30:17.301
when there was a former short course, you know, 
they used to have those, there would be quite a

30:08.568 --> 30:17.301
number. But sometimes you might not have over, 
from overnight mail, you might not have more than a

30:17.621 --> 30:25.593
half a dozen letters to deliver the next morning. 
All right, with all of that huge amount of cash then

30:26.134 --> 30:34.026
you made at nine cents a letter, what did you 
normally spend that on? Well, that's hard to say.

30:37.204 --> 30:48.842
Actually, it didn't amount to much, but it 
amounted to something, and you just extended it

30:37.204 --> 30:48.842
over into the school year for school purposes. 
Let's see, a church in those days, where did the

30:51.145 --> 31:02.342
churches were at the North Gate, except the 
Presbyterian, A&M Presbyterian Church met in the

30:51.145 --> 31:02.342
Y Chapel.
