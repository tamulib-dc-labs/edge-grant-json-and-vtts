00:05.397 --> 00:13.105
Okay,

00:05.397 --> 00:13.105
this is an interview with Jim Ball of Vista 
Chemicals by Kelly Gamblin. Do you agree to let A&M

00:13.605 --> 00:16.528
Archives have the results of this interview? Yes, 
I do. Thank you. My first question is, what was your

00:19.391 --> 00:22.434
date of birth and where were you born? February 
27th, 1943, and I was born in Bramer, Missouri. And

00:30.322 --> 00:31.504
what is your present age? 47. How did you decide to 
go into the armed services? Well, it was a matter of

00:39.122 --> 01:02.185
the fact that I came from the Midwest, and it was 
always part of the ethic when I was growing up, is

00:39.122 --> 01:02.185
that young men would go into service, 
particularly if their country was at war.

01:02.570 --> 01:09.278
At the time that I was starting to deal with this, it 
was early in the Vietnam conflict in 1965, let's

01:02.570 --> 01:09.278
say. And by the time I graduated in 1966, both the 
sort of support from

01:10.120 --> 01:24.177
myself within and from my friends was that we 
should go in, most of us. And in addition to that, I

01:25.419 --> 01:28.763
was going to get drafted in any case. So you had 
those things happen at the same time. So I

01:32.269 --> 01:39.621
ultimately did go in the Army then, but 
volunteered just shortly before the draft. OK.

01:41.504 --> 01:43.488
Which branch of the armed services did you join? In 
the Army. OK. What was your rank? Well, I went in as

01:47.835 --> 01:53.363
an enlisted man, and then went through the officer 
candidate school program. And I was a first

01:53.444 --> 01:56.809
lieutenant when I got out of the service. Okay, now 
as a first lieutenant, what was your job

01:57.532 --> 02:03.581
specifically in the field? In Vietnam was, first 
of all, I was an infantry platoon leader with the

02:03.601 --> 02:10.852
First Air Cavalry Division. And then I did that for 
the first six months, roughly. And then for the

02:16.640 --> 02:24.913
last six months, I was an air operations officer 
for my battalion. Okay. So you entered Vietnam

02:26.962 --> 02:30.888
shortly after high school graduation? After 
college. Oh, after college. Okay, so how old were

02:33.071 --> 02:35.695
you exactly? I've been, let's see, would have been 
24,

02:36.015 --> 02:43.887
I guess, when I went to Vietnam. Okay, I see. So you 
thought it was your duty to go over there and help?

02:49.415 --> 02:54.823
Well, in the early days, before I joined the 
service, I thought it was my duty. And then- After I

02:57.691 --> 03:10.763
got involved in the Army and got caught up in the 
program and the training and so forth, I was very

02:57.691 --> 03:10.763
successful in the Army. And I was in the state side 
for nearly two years. And I ended up being in the

03:15.648 --> 03:18.751
infantry school. And I was a tactical officer in 
the infantry school. So I was very much involved in

03:21.854 --> 03:25.217
teaching other people and training and how to 
fight and so forth. And so by the time I went to

03:28.628 --> 03:48.124
Vietnam, I not only felt it was my duty, which I did, 
Vietnam was becoming more controversial by then,

03:28.628 --> 03:48.124
1968, but still we didn't have the amount of 
controversy in 1968 as we had starting after the

03:28.628 --> 03:48.124
Tet Offensive, really, in 68. We didn't have as 
much controversy, so I did go, I guess, a

03:48.184 --> 03:55.390
combination of feeling it was a duty And also, I was 
trained to go. It was something I was doing. Well,

03:59.856 --> 04:12.355
when you actually found out, I mean, you got your 
notice that you were going to be shipped off to

03:59.856 --> 04:12.355
Vietnam, I mean, were you, was it a combination of 
excitement or fear or exactly how did you feel

03:59.856 --> 04:12.355
emotionally about going? Well, first of all, I 
volunteered to go to Vietnam. I volunteered two

04:17.143 --> 04:23.352
different times, as a matter of fact, and could not 
get released from my current assignment to go.

04:24.412 --> 04:26.154
until I had completed that. And so then I went as a 
matter of due course because it was just expected

04:27.255 --> 04:37.528
after the one-year assignment in Fort Benning I 
was on in infantry school. So it was more a matter of

04:37.548 --> 04:42.834
just kind of filling out something that was a plan 
for a long period of time. But certainly, sure,

04:43.214 --> 04:49.422
excitement, some fear, obviously, and so on. OK. 
I've been told that Vietnam is a beautiful

04:49.792 --> 04:53.695
country. I was just wondering, when you finally 
arrived there, what was your initial impression

04:53.996 --> 05:04.164
of, say, the country, the people, their kind of 
culture? What did you feel about them? Well,

05:08.388 --> 05:12.051
Vietnam looks like a lot of Southeast Asia. And 
there are parts of it that are scenic. I think they

05:19.745 --> 05:25.171
would be primarily along the coastline and in the 
mountains. I saw almost none of the coastline. Of

05:30.037 --> 05:43.833
course, when I first arrived, if that's what 
you're asking, I landed on K,

05:30.037 --> 05:43.833
I guess it was. And from there, We went out to the 
field right away, and the particular area we were

05:46.002 --> 05:52.051
in was not very attractive. And then we worked in 
the coastal plains for a while, and that area was

05:52.071 --> 05:57.739
not particularly attractive either. But then 
after about a month or so, we went into the

05:57.759 --> 06:07.733
mountains in a jungle mountain setting while it 
was attractive, if you will.

06:08.575 --> 06:14.423
When you arrived in Vietnam, what did you feel was 
your specific purpose there? as a person, and what

06:15.517 --> 06:18.880
were you doing for your country? Well, I was there 
as an infantry officer, so my job was to organize

06:19.741 --> 06:32.092
and lead my men to close with and destroy the enemy. 
So by then, they were already operating on search

06:33.474 --> 06:39.239
and destroy missions by this time? Search and 
destroy is only a narrow definition of a broad kind

06:39.960 --> 06:44.764
of tactics. And certainly those tactics were well 
established long before that. The only reason

06:49.495 --> 07:05.374
that once you get past the phase, for instance, in 
something like Vietnam where the role of the

06:49.495 --> 07:05.374
military is to train others, then the mission in a 
war is to do exactly that in one way or another,

06:49.495 --> 07:05.374
search and destroy. Okay. Did you think you could 
win the war? Yes, yeah. Okay. When you first went

07:13.203 --> 07:14.785
over there, was it? the kind of idea that you could 
win it quickly without any problems? No, no, by no

07:20.688 --> 07:22.530
means. I landed in May of 68, and by that time we'd 
been in Vietnam already for three years. By virtue

07:29.679 --> 07:42.814
of being in the infantry school in Fort Benning and 
with lots of returning soldiers

07:29.679 --> 07:42.814
from Vietnam, lots of firsthand stories as to what 
the problems were in fighting the war. Our

07:47.307 --> 07:55.875
training was, we were constantly trying to update 
our training to be current with the situation and

07:47.307 --> 07:55.875
be realistic in the situation. So there was never, 
it should never have been any expectation on the

07:55.895 --> 08:06.185
part of people who were trained that there was 
going to be a fast or easy type of conversation. Did

08:07.246 --> 08:12.531
you ever get to the point where you almost thought, 
this is impossible, this is never going to work?

08:13.743 --> 08:14.684
Oh, yes, sure. You have ups and downs in those kinds 
of things. Right. I mean, part of those doubts

08:19.510 --> 08:28.239
could only come about as you experienced 
different kinds of events that happened during

08:19.510 --> 08:28.239
the period. For instance,

08:28.980 --> 08:39.793
in the first part of my tour, we operated in the I 
Corps. That's the northern part of South Vietnam.

08:43.055 --> 08:47.321
And we're working along in the mountains along 
close to the Asha Valley. And that area.

08:54.372 --> 08:57.417
Had been a very hot area in the early part of 1968. 
And by the early fall of 1968 was actually starting

08:59.159 --> 09:04.247
to calm down. We were running into much less 
resistance.

09:08.934 --> 09:09.335
And we. Picked up. And on very short order, in less 
than 24 hours, we moved the whole division south to

09:12.248 --> 09:20.698
work along the Cambodian border. And we were going 
into an area which basically no large-scale

09:21.279 --> 09:32.992
friendly allied or just friendly forces had 
operated since the beginning of the Vietnam

09:21.279 --> 09:32.992
conflict. It had been no man's land for all that 
period of time. And we were staging on

09:36.296 --> 09:42.103
a little remote airstrip to go into a combat 
assault by helicopter into an area that was just a

09:42.370 --> 09:51.658
few thousand meters from the Cambodian border. 
And what virtually happened is that we were there,

09:53.660 --> 10:01.306
and helicopters were coming in to pick us up. And 
one of my men had a transistor radio on, and Lyndon

10:01.326 --> 10:12.276
Johnson announced that we were going to cease the 
bombing in North Vietnam. So at times like that,

10:12.357 --> 10:23.028
some despair would set in and say, you know, this is 
never going to work if we're not going to be willing

10:12.357 --> 10:23.028
to take this and fight it to its fullest extent. One 
of the things that we've discussed in this class to

10:23.188 --> 10:34.880
a pretty big extent was how

10:23.188 --> 10:34.880
were you going to win the hearts and minds of the 
Vietnamese people? What exactly did that mean to

10:34.961 --> 10:36.382
you? Well, first of all, I have virtually no 
personal experience with it. because I was

10:42.901 --> 10:54.977
only exposed to the Vietnamese civilian 
population a very few times. But the slogan meant,

10:54.997 --> 11:12.520
I think in general, is that we will go in and try to 
show the Vietnamese people that they can protect

10:54.997 --> 11:12.520
themselves, first of all, and that we would be 
willing to help them, not only protect

11:13.478 --> 11:25.997
themselves, but to grow as a country, grow 
economically, and grow politically.

11:27.900 --> 11:41.882
And our missions there then were to bolster the 
Army, to provide medical care, to provide, in

11:27.900 --> 11:41.882
fact, some agricultural training was done in some 
areas. to win the support of the people and to win,

11:42.149 --> 11:47.175
you know, literally their hearts. That means the 
support part of it. And the minds is that they were,

11:49.818 --> 12:03.655
on an intellectual basis, we would identify with 
the Americans as friendly and with democracy as a

11:49.818 --> 12:03.655
way of government that they should be pursuing. We 
talked also about how Arvin was hard to work with,

12:03.955 --> 12:10.823
partly because they were not as at least according 
to a professor, they were not nearly as skilled as

12:11.630 --> 12:21.043
the American troops, even though they had 
American training. Did you have problems, or did

12:22.525 --> 12:25.168
you even work with them to start with? I never, so I 
can't really comment.

12:31.176 --> 12:37.425
I have some doubts about those reports, though, 
that they were not as skilled as American

12:31.176 --> 12:37.425
soldiers. I think the problem was was more likely 
to be is that large parts of the Vietnamese army was

12:40.165 --> 12:54.261
corrupt and the soldiers perceived this to be 
true, and so therefore they weren't motivated to

12:40.165 --> 12:54.261
fight. It wasn't a matter of skill per se. MS. Do you 
happen to know? I don't know no more about that than

12:58.766 --> 13:01.489
people who read about it. I mean, that's all I know. 
You don't know anything about their desertion

13:04.195 --> 13:06.779
rates? I don't, no. That's basically hearsay on 
your part? Yeah, more than the things that you read

13:09.703 --> 13:13.188
from others. We talked about also about how during 
the later part of the war years when it was getting

13:13.208 --> 13:24.804
to be very controversial that some of the troops 
even decided that they weren't going to fight.

13:25.144 --> 13:25.845
U.S. troops. That they just had enough. Did you 
ever encounter any problems in this? I think that

13:32.134 --> 13:33.696
phenomenon really... started to happen in the 
early 70s. That's when we started to hear about

13:37.619 --> 13:40.261
those reports in some major way. And we heard about 
the fraggings, for instance.

13:47.148 --> 13:56.778
In any war, in any combat situation, you're going 
to have a few people who, for one reason or another,

13:47.148 --> 13:56.778
will refuse to fight. I personally, within my 
platoon, only had one person, I would say, that

14:05.030 --> 14:10.959
that would really apply to for sure. I mean, some 
others who were very ineffective in fighting, but

14:10.979 --> 14:18.631
that was more from just an absolute fear than 
anything else. So it wasn't a problem. And also,

14:22.056 --> 14:29.788
one of the things that I believe is true is when you 
hear or read about Vietnam one has to distinguish

14:30.933 --> 14:38.303
carefully between what time period it was and also 
what sort of unit that one was talking about.

14:38.564 --> 14:56.469
Another aspect of the same thing, and I'll make the 
same observation as on drugs, is in the later part

14:38.564 --> 14:56.469
of the Vietnam conflict, we heard an awful lot 
about the use of drugs by soldiers, and that was

14:38.564 --> 14:56.469
obviously true from things that have happened 
since then, reports we've heard since then. But I

14:57.390 --> 14:59.573
think both in the case of of the use of drugs and in 
things like morale problems, it was a function

14:59.958 --> 15:10.451
often of the units that people were in as well. And 
the 1st Air Cav was a reasonably well-run unit, and

15:11.613 --> 15:24.388
it was still considered to be an elite type of 
operation. It was an air operations. It and the

15:26.451 --> 15:29.695
101st Airborne were the only two in Vietnam. A 
large number of the officers were volunteer,

15:31.531 --> 15:37.660
volunteered wanting to do that specific thing. 
And so we didn't have the problems, I don't think.

15:42.527 --> 15:43.929
Well, I should make one of the observations. That 
is, we were in the field all the time. If you're in

15:46.152 --> 15:51.139
the field and you didn't have access to the 
civilian population, you didn't have access to

15:46.152 --> 15:51.139
drugs. Now, my impression is that the combination 
of drugs being late in the war kind of led and and

15:59.527 --> 16:08.176
being part of a so-so unit that didn't have very 
good morale led to a lot of those combat desertions

15:59.527 --> 16:08.176
that you're talking about. What were your 
feelings about the students who were protesting

16:08.196 --> 16:15.724
back in the States, the anti-war movement? Well, 
I'm sure that

16:15.745 --> 16:29.179
a large number of those students were motivated 
because they really believed what we were doing

16:15.745 --> 16:29.179
was unjust. But the truth of the matter is most of 
them were really only motivated to go out and do

16:30.442 --> 16:41.258
very much about demonstrating because they were 
also fearful for their own personal safety of

16:30.442 --> 16:41.258
being involved in something that they weren't 
involved in. So, I mean, in many cases, I can

16:41.298 --> 16:51.632
remember having thoughts is that I believe that 
some of these people believe in what they're

16:41.298 --> 16:51.632
doing. But frequently, why I believe that they 
really didn't want to go themselves was the main

16:52.494 --> 16:57.841
issue they were working on. Right. I think you're 
right. Okay. Looking back now, do you think

17:02.943 --> 17:07.789
Vietnam could be won? Could it have been won? Well, 
it certainly, yes, it could have been won, but only

17:09.992 --> 17:27.634
by an effort that involved

17:09.992 --> 17:27.634
probably ultimately an invasion of North 
Vietnam, but at least a more extensive bombing. of

17:27.985 --> 17:54.718
north vietnam yeah okay do you think it was ever 
well let me put it this way do you think it would have

17:27.985 --> 17:54.718
been helpful for the u.s to go into north vietnam i 
mean literally with troops and all well if would

17:27.985 --> 17:54.718
have been helpful in the narrow sense of winning 
the war yes but in what was good for the united

17:27.985 --> 17:54.718
states no because the the the loss of life would 
have been enormous unless you basically

17:55.171 --> 18:08.871
decimated the North Vietnamese people by bombing 
ahead of time and that would have been a tragedy as

17:55.171 --> 18:08.871
well because I think the larger lesson in Vietnam 
is that it ultimately probably didn't mean as much

17:55.171 --> 18:08.871
as we thought it did in 1965. And so anything that we 
might have done to have made it a larger scale

18:10.393 --> 18:18.405
operation probably wouldn't have been worth it. I 
mean after all in Vietnam our Our enemies were,

18:24.972 --> 18:32.002
first of all, the North Vietnamese, and they were 
being supported by the Chinese and by the

18:24.972 --> 18:32.002
Russians. Well, the North Vietnamese don't 
really matter today as far as being someone who is

18:32.743 --> 18:42.397
not a friend and supporter of the United States. 
And the Chinese, the relationships are much

18:43.378 --> 18:48.526
better. Tiananmen Square of last year 
notwithstanding, those will again improve, I

18:48.566 --> 18:53.713
believe. and obviously things are improving with 
the Russians.

18:59.655 --> 19:09.691
So as time has shown, it's just that Vietnam wasn't 
worth it at the cost it did have, and so it certainly

18:59.655 --> 19:09.691
wouldn't have been worth it to do anymore. Well, if 
there had been an invasion of North Vietnam of

19:10.852 --> 19:21.068
ground troops, was there a real threat of the 
Chinese or Moscow intervening into the war, do you

19:10.852 --> 19:21.068
think? I don't think the Russians would have.

19:28.086 --> 19:33.193
And on the Chinese,

19:28.086 --> 19:33.193
it's difficult to say. The precedent had been set, 
of course, in Korea for them to have done so. And the

19:39.201 --> 19:52.759
Chinese in those days, I think, were much more 
prone to do so, but they were also tied up in their

19:39.201 --> 19:52.759
own cultural revolution at the time, too. I don't 
know. I mean, I don't think there is any clear

19:56.307 --> 19:59.130
coming, but it would have been a big risk. It would 
have been a risk for sure because most of the

19:59.190 --> 20:11.742
support, the direct support the North Vietnamese 
were getting in those days in terms of materiel and

19:59.190 --> 20:11.742
advisors, I think, were coming from China. Okay. 
So when did you leave Vietnam to come back to the

20:12.142 --> 20:15.706
States? In May of 69. Okay. And did you have any 
problems fitting back into civilian life? No. OK,

20:24.430 --> 20:27.274
so how did you get involved with Vista Chemicals? 
Well, let's see. I came back and decided I wasn't

20:29.416 --> 20:34.663
quite ready yet to go to work. And so I went to 
graduate school for a semester. But my plan all the

20:39.248 --> 20:49.541
time was that I would use that period of time while I 
was in graduate school to start interviewing,

20:39.248 --> 20:49.541
looking for jobs. And I did so, interviewed with a 
number of companies, And I had a good friend

20:53.742 --> 20:57.949
working for Conoco, which is the predecessor to 
Vista. And the combination of knowing some people

20:58.950 --> 21:06.422
there and having a very favorable interview and 
liking what they had to say is as simple a matter as

20:58.950 --> 21:06.422
that. So I joined Conoco then in September of 69. 
OK. And what was your starting position? Did you

21:13.694 --> 21:15.236
have a title? I like a title. Everyone has like a 
title.

21:21.788 --> 21:25.793
I was on the oil side of Conoco, and that was a 
marketing training. Okay. So how long have you

21:27.916 --> 21:30.900
been with Conoco and Vista? 20 years. Oh, a long 
time. 69 double. And so now you're senior vice

21:34.025 --> 21:36.328
president. And so how did you get to that position, 
besides lots of hard work? Well, I mean, that's

21:41.875 --> 21:44.639
probably it, isn't it? Sure. I mean, lots of hard 
work and lots of opportunity presented. to me and

21:50.122 --> 21:53.226
lots of support from a lot of other people. Well, do 
you think that it's important for, say, my

21:55.268 --> 22:03.638
generation and the ones that follow to know about 
Vietnam and what happened there and why? Sure,

22:03.738 --> 22:06.962
absolutely.

22:08.263 --> 22:10.546
Why do you think it's important for them to know? 
Well, I think it's only important

22:10.566 --> 22:18.255
in the same context as that all major events in our 
history are important for all people, including

22:19.535 --> 22:26.222
people of your generation, to know about.

22:31.508 --> 22:47.044
Certainly the events of the 60s and the early 70s 
set into place, set into motion, a lot of things in

22:31.508 --> 22:47.044
this country and our feeling about warfare is only 
one of those, but that's it. That's it. And we are

22:51.995 --> 22:59.526
dealing with societal problems today that are 
still emanating from people. So understanding

22:59.546 --> 23:08.860
what Vietnam was about would be as important in 
trying to understand those.

23:08.880 --> 23:16.592
We have, you know, a number of people who are 
veterans of Vietnam who are claiming all kinds of

23:16.842 --> 23:24.572
psychological and physiological problems 
related to the service in Vietnam. And if you're

23:25.633 --> 23:31.640
going to have those people out claiming that, 
well, then you ought to have some recognition of

23:25.633 --> 23:31.640
what was that all about. I think there's probably 
been a lot of increased awareness because of the

23:31.760 --> 23:40.251
movies that have been out lately, like Fourth of 
July. That appeals to a lot of the younger

23:42.033 --> 23:44.516
generation. Yeah, those people. Those people, I 
mean, the people that were, I mean, the very

23:46.137 --> 23:55.068
obvious cases were people who made enormous 
sacrifices. And

23:55.108 --> 24:07.824
for them to have made that sacrifice and to be part 
of our society, society needs to understand what

23:55.108 --> 24:07.824
their role was and what they did. And it must be 
difficult, extremely difficult for those

24:07.984 --> 24:11.368
people.

24:14.234 --> 24:21.441
to know in their heart is that what they did at the 
time, they may or may not have thought was the right

24:14.234 --> 24:21.441
thing. To know that after some period of time, 
society no longer supported it. And now, you know,

24:28.148 --> 24:37.217
I am suggesting is that history has proven it 
probably didn't matter a whole great deal, as it

24:28.148 --> 24:37.217
turns out. It only happened, it was only important 
because that's what it was important to support

24:42.500 --> 24:48.269
the activities of the country at that time, and we 
must have a citizenry which is willing to do that.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.976
Well, have you ever gone back to Vietnam? No, I 
haven't. Do you think you ever would? Oh, yes. I

24:55.801 --> 24:57.543
have a file right over here I can show you. As soon as 
I can go back with State Department sanction, I'll

24:57.703 --> 25:01.069
go. Wow. My prof, I asked him the same question, and 
he said he visits Vietnam. Does he? and some of the

25:08.555 --> 25:12.760
other Southeast Asian countries, like Cambodia 
and Laos. And I asked him how the people responded

25:13.481 --> 25:18.146
to him, and he said that they were just great. Well, 
I'd like to talk to him about how he does it. I mean,

25:21.190 --> 25:27.317
quite seriously, I'd like to get his name and his 
telephone number, if I might, and talk to him about

25:21.190 --> 25:27.317
that. Because the extent to which I've 
investigated it, the problem is on getting a visa.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.190
First of all, you cannot get a visa in this country. 
So what one has to do is to go to some place like

25:39.520 --> 25:44.226
Bangkok and then apply for a visa. And it's a very 
uncertain process. It takes a lot of time. And I

25:47.891 --> 25:54.160
don't really have the time to go to Bangkok and then 
wait around for a week or two until I get a visa. But I

25:54.380 --> 25:55.822
might like to talk to him and see. Maybe he's got an 
entree that I don't understand. I'm sure he can

25:59.367 --> 26:02.050
help. Okay, I will. I guess my final question is, 
have you ever been to Washington to see the...

26:09.743 --> 26:12.366
Veterans War Memorial. What was your impression 
when you saw that? I'll tell you because part of it

26:17.813 --> 26:22.819
is somewhat humorous. Most of it is not. But yes, I 
did. I went to see it. I can't recall what year it was

26:27.345 --> 26:29.067
now. It must have been dedicated in the early fall 
of about 1984 or 5. Does that sound right? Sometime

26:37.978 --> 26:38.839
around that. Maybe a little later. At any case, I 
was in Washington, D.C. for a meeting that takes

26:41.738 --> 26:53.516
place in October of every year, so I know when I was 
in Washington anyway, and went to see the

26:41.738 --> 26:53.516
memorial. And it had only been open at that time for 
a few weeks, and it was kind of a rainy, cold day. And

27:02.069 --> 27:08.780
I went down, and the ground around the memorial, 
they put sod down, but it wasn't very well put down.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.362
It was very muddied around there in the end. 
virtually had to walk on what looked like packing

27:10.763 --> 27:21.794
crates, or these skids you put underneath for 
forklifts to pick up. And he kind of walked across

27:22.254 --> 27:24.016
that to get to it. And I thought that was very 
appropriate for Vietnam. It kind of had this

27:26.398 --> 27:29.561
construction site look in the mud. So that was one 
thing. But once I got to the wall, then it became a

27:31.123 --> 27:34.125
very emotional experience. Not extremely 
emotional, but a bit emotional. And I have been

27:37.709 --> 27:40.011
back. probably since I do go to Washington quite a 
bit, I've been back to it probably three or four

27:41.324 --> 27:51.019
more times since then, once with my family. And 
it's always with some emotion. And I particularly

27:55.125 --> 28:01.595
like also the statue that's at the end of it. I think 
it's very lifelike. Have you seen it? No, but I've

28:03.958 --> 28:05.280
been told about it. Yeah, I think you really should 
see it. I would love to. It's very lifelike, and

28:07.664 --> 28:10.268
it's very... representative, in fact, of the type 
of gear that soldiers wore in Vietnam. I mean, you

28:17.757 --> 28:27.134
know, down to the way they tied their boots and the 
way their pants are bloused out over the boots and a

28:17.757 --> 28:27.134
towel around one guy's neck and so forth. And you 
walk around behind the equipment, it's very

28:27.154 --> 28:30.159
authentic looking. So I thought it was very well 
done. And the facial expressions and so forth are

28:32.142 --> 28:35.428
very good. That's very interesting. Well, are 
there any closing comments you'd like to make? No,

28:39.555 --> 28:41.940
not at all. Well, I thank you very much for this 
interview. I'm sure it would be very enlightening

28:43.964 --> 28:47.192
for someone else as it has been for me. Thank you.
