WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:11.441
What were, as the wife of the land commissioner, 
what were your social responsibilities in

00:02.427 --> 00:11.441
Austin? Well, all the state official ladies had to 
belong to state official ladies club, so I was a

00:11.461 --> 00:19.855
member of that. And even after I came here, Earl 
insisted I keep my membership. I did for a ton of

00:25.965 --> 00:29.430
years. So I went to that. Who were your favorite 
state official ladies during those years? Well,

00:38.141 --> 00:45.851
Rue Walker's wife, he was on the court, Supreme 
Court, Virginia. I don't know, Mary Alice

00:47.793 --> 00:49.175
Shivers. You know, she just died a couple years 
ago. And she and I had a good mutual friend. And as

01:00.764 --> 01:04.901
soon as I heard that she had died, I called Anna Mae 
Morrison. Now, her husband was not a state

01:05.343 --> 01:08.175
official, But Shivers went into business with 
Anna Mae's husband after he left the governor's

01:08.476 --> 01:13.564
office. Anyway, I called her, and she said that she 
had talked to her just a couple of days before she

01:13.584 --> 01:20.335
died. And she said, Anna Mae, I don't want anybody 
standing up looking at me in the casket. Said, if

01:26.044 --> 01:30.751
you have to, just sit on that lid to keep it from 
opening. OK, that's all. All right, so. Oh, Weldon

01:34.200 --> 01:40.886
Hart was Shiver's right-hand man, and his wife was 
a good friend. I don't know. All right, you all are

01:42.948 --> 01:45.471
there. The kids are in school. In four different 
schools part of the time. And you've got a

01:50.055 --> 01:52.378
comfortable house. Yeah. How was it, who was it 
that communicated with Mr. Rutter about possibly

01:54.240 --> 02:01.787
coming over to College Station? whoever was 
chairman of the board, but I don't think it was Pat

02:03.050 --> 02:09.779
Zachary, but Pat Zachary talked to me about it. 
Like I said, Earl was real undecided if he wanted to

02:12.023 --> 02:18.752
do it because he was afraid he'd be resented. 
Because he just had a lowly bachelor degree. He'd

02:22.918 --> 02:25.201
done little work on a master's, but not a whole lot. 
While we were at Tarleton, we'd drive up to Fort

02:26.323 --> 02:29.687
Worth and do it through TCU. But Pat Zachary did, he 
Talk to me, I'll never forget it. He was the kindest

02:34.830 --> 02:36.052
person. And he wanted me to kinda influence Earl on 
coming here. Were there others that you know of

02:42.122 --> 02:47.370
that worked hard to persuade him? Who, Earl? Yes, 
ma'am. I don't know. But I know this, when we first

02:51.997 --> 03:01.592
came over here on the campus, and I was seeing the 
house we were to live in, I thought, good heavens, I

03:01.724 --> 03:05.533
don't have enough furniture to furnish that big 
old house. And you know what happened to it. We'd

03:08.701 --> 03:09.883
been in it five years. We'll get to that in a minute. 
All right, so you all moved over here when? We moved

03:16.599 --> 03:19.446
over here the 20... I think it was around the 26th of 
January of 1958, the start of the second semester.

03:26.555 --> 03:27.537
That's what I had thought. And you moved into that 
big house. Was there some furniture already

03:32.807 --> 03:35.031
there? Oh, yeah. The university had furnished 
almost all of the downstairs. Now, we had to buy

03:39.960 --> 03:43.847
breakfast room furniture, but All the downstairs 
furniture was university, and a lot of it is in use

03:44.958 --> 03:50.466
still in the President's House on campus. Right. 
Did you keep all of your furniture from the Austin

03:50.727 --> 03:53.591
house? Or did you get rid of some? Oh, yeah, but it 
didn't amount to a whole lot. Okay. It was

03:58.738 --> 04:01.422
upstairs, so it got burned. And this house was west 
of Sabeasa. You know, I've never been in those

04:07.511 --> 04:11.778
directions, but it was first lived in by Lawrence 
Sullivan Ross. That was a point to remember.

04:13.540 --> 04:14.762
Right. 1892, I think, it was built. How did you feel 
that you were received by the local community?

04:24.482 --> 04:28.187
They were always nice, but I was, oh, heavens, I was 
afraid. Like I said, nobody told me what I was

04:29.489 --> 04:31.612
supposed to do. And you didn't know, you didn't 
have any... I didn't have any background for it.

04:37.201 --> 04:39.845
And you didn't have any friend here in advance, did 
you? You didn't know any of the wives or... Now, the

04:42.518 --> 04:48.864
Davises had had us over for a military weekend 
while Earl was still in the land office. I'll never

04:50.506 --> 04:51.346
forget that. I met Lupo. We got out there, and 
actually, we had left Brady, and they wanted me to

04:53.969 --> 05:00.455
bring Bud with me. What's your time doing? I'm 
doing fine. Bring Bud because the Davises had

05:03.858 --> 05:06.781
Steadman. Did you know he had died several years 
ago? No. And see, Bud is now 58, and Stedman was

05:10.480 --> 05:13.643
probably the same age. And he died. I don't know 
what reason or anything. Don't know what about Joe

05:17.968 --> 05:19.230
or... I kind of think Marie's not living, but 
anyway. We came down, and it was just this balmy

05:24.555 --> 05:28.399
weather. Flowers were blooming in Austin. We 
picked Earl up in Austin. And... You know, see,

05:35.945 --> 05:37.387
what happened to Earl? He didn't have time to look 
for a place, and he was staying in the Commodore

05:37.407 --> 05:42.312
Perry Hotel. I don't know whether it's even there 
now or not. But Jake Pickle heard that Earl was

05:44.595 --> 05:47.738
staying there. And see, Jake's first wife had 
died. And they had just the one little girl, Peggy.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.767
And so his wife's parents took Peggy. And so Jake 
could still work. And anyway...

06:05.408 --> 06:30.201
he when he heard that Earl was staying at the hotel 
and he was out there in the house by himself so he

06:05.408 --> 06:30.201
just go down and said Earl this is silly he said just 
pack your stuff and come on out and stay at my house

06:05.408 --> 06:30.201
with me so Earl did and he stayed there from January 
till we got moved in August anyway

06:05.408 --> 06:30.201
what was your first reaction to College Station 
Amazement, I guess. I don't know. I was still

06:34.778 --> 06:36.981
trying to find out what I was supposed to do.

06:40.746 --> 06:43.950
But, you know, it goes on years and years.

06:46.774 --> 06:47.535
Who was it left? Gordon Eaton, was that a name? He 
went to University of Iowa, maybe? Iowa State.

06:54.765 --> 06:56.648
Iowa State, yeah. And she came to me. She said, 
somebody told me that I should talk to you about...

07:01.248 --> 07:03.150
what I should do is being a university president. I 
said, the only thing I can tell you is just be

07:04.251 --> 07:06.312
yourself. That's all I could, I didn't have any 
magic words at all. As far as you know, when you all

07:11.357 --> 07:20.364
came here, was Mr. Rutter given any directions by 
the board or anybody as to what he was to do? He was to

07:21.245 --> 07:22.826
be in charge of this campus. Was he supposed to 
straighten anything out or clean anything up? You

07:29.032 --> 07:30.613
know, I don't really remember that. I don't know. I 
really don't know. But I know that Earl, from the

07:35.072 --> 07:45.609
time we got here, he would always call Mr. Heaton to 
find out what the enrollment was as soon as they

07:35.072 --> 07:45.609
registered. And he was keeping his eye on that 
enrollment because it wasn't going anywhere.

07:49.856 --> 07:50.397
That's right. It was just stagnant. And so He knew 
that some changes had to be made. I don't know how

07:58.608 --> 08:00.090
Earl knew these things. I tell you what, I finally 
decided years and years later that I felt like he

08:00.210 --> 08:07.719
went through so much in World War II. And if he could 
live through that, he could do about anything.

08:12.946 --> 08:13.867
Sure. But the changes that were made, the most 
controversial, of course, was letting the girls

08:13.887 --> 08:19.314
in. And, of course, he had help on that board and 
everything. As of late, it looked like somebody

08:23.935 --> 08:29.541
else made all those decisions, you know, but 
anyway, he was pretty involved. And when he got up

08:30.061 --> 08:41.453
and announced to the student body, all male, all 
military, that the girls would be coming, they

08:30.061 --> 08:41.453
booed him. And that was the most controversial. 
The next most controversial was allowing the

08:44.997 --> 08:50.803
Corps to be optional. But there were old Aggies 
that didn't speak to him again after that. Oh, you

08:55.174 --> 08:57.078
know one in Beaumont. Yes, that's Charlie 
Babcock.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.198
As you all got started here, How did the children 
react? Well, it's funny. I was most concerned

09:10.736 --> 09:13.279
about Ann. See, Bud was already in A&M, but Ann had 
the nicest bunch of friends in Austin that you'd

09:13.839 --> 09:24.869
ever want your daughter to have, and I was worried 
about how she'd feel. Well, at the end of that first

09:25.789 --> 09:34.457
year, I told Earl, much to his amazement, that when 
he went to summer camp, I was going to take the kids

09:25.789 --> 09:34.457
and go over, and we still hadn't sold our house in 
Austin. I was going to take the kids over there and

09:36.160 --> 10:04.885
we were going to stay there and we had a wonderful 
time didn't have any furniture we took sleeping

09:36.160 --> 10:04.885
bags and Jane had a slumber party for her birthday 
because it was always when Earl was gone they just

09:36.160 --> 10:04.885
had a great time and Earl said you can't stay in the 
house that had any furniture I said that's all

09:36.160 --> 10:04.885
right we'll just take sleeping bags and we drove 
into Austin and Ann's remark was I wouldn't move

09:36.160 --> 10:04.885
back here for a million dollars she had just fit 
right in from the time we came here because in my

10:05.523 --> 10:29.775
interview with her i got that impression did you 
interview her yes ma'am about two weeks ago yeah

10:05.523 --> 10:29.775
and let's see now one of the questions i asked her 
i'd like to compare your answer i said and based on

10:05.523 --> 10:29.775
your recollections what big worries 
frustrations problems do you remember your dad

10:30.413 --> 10:51.679
talking about he didn't talk at the house from the 
office and she said he never broke no he didn't and

10:30.413 --> 10:51.679
that's why i was just so dumb i didn't i didn't know 
what was going on somebody tell me something i'd

10:30.413 --> 10:51.679
tell earl he said i knew that long ago Now, I assumed 
that part of that came from his military

10:53.195 --> 10:57.810
experience. Could have been. That maybe you don't 
take the battle plans and discuss them. He just

11:02.244 --> 11:04.993
never brought any university business home. Now, 
when y'all first got here, where was his office

11:06.374 --> 11:10.059
located? In the Koch Building. All right, so even 
from the first, in the Koch Building. Yeah. All

11:14.166 --> 11:14.386
right. Now, his title at first was executive vice 
president? Just vice president, I think. Okay.

11:19.774 --> 11:21.176
And then he became president. But he was in charge 
of this campus. Yes, ma'am. And then the next year,

11:23.960 --> 11:28.327
in 59, he was named president. And, of course, in 
65... He was named head of the system. Both. I

11:34.970 --> 11:35.551
remember that. President of the university and of 
the system. In those earliest years, on whom do you

11:38.554 --> 11:45.301
think he most relied? Who were his? I'm finding 
out. Wayne Hall and Dorsey McCrory. See, Dorsey

11:50.007 --> 11:51.949
was his first assistant. Right. Now, where did he 
first know Dorsey? I don't know. He never told me

11:58.296 --> 12:00.478
that. I don't know whether they knew each other. I 
kind of think there was Army Reserve connections.

12:04.537 --> 12:07.861
Well, he had a military career, of course, Dorsey 
did. But I don't know that they knew each other. I

12:12.346 --> 12:13.668
just don't know. And, of course, Dorothy, Dorothy 
McCrory's dad was Dorsey's general. Oh, I didn't

12:20.475 --> 12:21.957
know that. She was the general's daughter. What 
parts of the task do you think Mr. Rudder most

12:27.603 --> 12:29.065
enjoyed? and least enjoyed of being president? I 
hate to say what he would have enjoyed. I don't

12:37.763 --> 12:38.143
know. He just enjoyed always working with young 
people, young men particularly. And I don't know

12:45.109 --> 12:48.692
what he least enjoyed. I don't know. He never told 
me. He never said, I don't enjoy this. Like, I don't

12:55.758 --> 12:57.840
think he enjoyed making speeches. Oh, no, he 
didn't. You're right there. he didn't on the other

13:00.618 --> 13:25.866
hand I have the impression that he did enjoy going 
to Austin and Washington into the real world of

13:00.618 --> 13:25.866
politics because he knew so many people you know 
when Ed Cooper became his assistant and I guess

13:00.618 --> 13:25.866
that he followed Dorsey and I don't remember what 
Dorsey did after he was a development director

13:00.618 --> 13:25.866
that's right But I had seen a picture of Ed in the 
battalion, I guess, and said he was going to be

13:26.858 --> 13:36.849
Earl's new assistant. Earl didn't tell me that he 
was having him over at his luncheon before the ball

13:36.869 --> 13:40.793
game. Of course, those luncheons were so small, 
they were in the assembly room, and it would only

13:41.133 --> 13:47.180
hold a certain number. Anyway, I looked across, 
and there was Ed Cooper. I knew it was him because

13:50.343 --> 13:53.727
I'd seen his picture in the paper. happened to have 
caught my eye at the same time. Well, here he came

13:56.068 --> 13:58.771
and he said, is there anything I can do for you, Miss 
Rutter? I said, nobody ever asked me that before. I

14:03.037 --> 14:04.058
was looking after Earl. I said, I accused the 
battalion of photographers the same thing.

14:08.003 --> 14:10.787
They'd get Earl looking just real pretty and I'd 
look like the Dickinson. They'd snap the picture.

14:15.573 --> 14:18.637
Let's see, Hall and McCrory. On the board, who were 
the people that you remember that mr rudder worked

14:24.301 --> 14:51.355
with most closely i don't know what i think that 
most closely or not but we both knew and thought the

14:24.301 --> 14:51.355
world of pat zachary and you know earl could call on 
him if somebody that was supposed to have made a

14:24.301 --> 14:51.355
commencement address had to cancel out at the last 
minute well you could ask pat zachary he could say

14:24.301 --> 14:51.355
more in fewer words than anybody i ever knew and He 
was just the nicest person. Of course, Sterling

14:54.931 --> 14:57.193
Evans was a good friend. Earl could not have asked 
for a better board to work with. I've always, in my

15:02.360 --> 15:08.467
remarks about those times of change, I've said how 
blessed we were at that point. Oh, absolutely.

15:09.949 --> 15:18.439
These were people who had made big decisions, and 
they were not out to try to... make their egos

15:19.060 --> 15:20.542
bigger. No. They did it for the good of A&M. That's 
right. That's right. Boyle. Who? Mr. Boyle from

15:27.930 --> 15:29.792
Dow Chemical. Dr. Boyle, yeah. He was a fine 
person. Al Davies. Al's not good right now. Oh,

15:36.380 --> 15:36.880
really? No. Mildred called me. And Dick Goodson 
from Southwestern Bell. All of those people were

15:43.228 --> 15:46.091
good and positive. Oh, absolutely good. All 
right.

15:51.055 --> 16:02.773
non-compulsory core and co-education and name 
change and so forth, I was on the aspirations

15:51.055 --> 16:02.773
committee and it was my job to write the draft of 
that report. Was that the blueprint for progress

16:03.514 --> 16:05.357
or not? No, that one comes later. Okay. And I turned 
it in to Vice President Hall. He called me three or

16:14.991 --> 16:16.894
four days later and gave me a copy which Mr. Rutter 
had read, a rough draft, and he had many comments

16:18.477 --> 16:24.944
and so forth. Earl, did he? Yes, ma'am. Make his 
case. Yes, ma'am. Some of which were disagreement

16:28.368 --> 16:34.815
with our, and Dr. Hall had said, here, take it, 
redraft it. I go back to him and I said, sir, I can't

16:35.416 --> 16:46.328
in good faith make some of these changes because 
our committee, these are our recommendations. We

16:46.348 --> 16:47.269
may be in error. But we do believe that if we don't 
have co-education, if we don't make the Corps

16:47.553 --> 16:56.407
volunteer, that we're not going to grow. And the 
fourth change was admitting the minorities.

17:00.133 --> 17:00.373
Right. And that was done very smoothly. Right. And 
he said, I'll stake my job. Who, Earl said that? No,

17:07.344 --> 17:09.267
Hall. See, I hadn't talked to Mr. Rutter at all. He 
said, I'll stake my job on your... opportunity to

17:16.696 --> 17:20.520
say what the committee believes. Now, I can't 
guarantee you what's going to be the result, but

17:20.760 --> 17:25.425
do. And as I have heard through the grapevine that 
Fred Benson and Hall both spoke up and that Mr.

17:25.445 --> 17:38.538
Rutter listened to them. But let's try to name the 
others who deserve credit. we had at that point we

17:43.831 --> 18:13.365
had Bill Moore supportive we had Sterling Evans on 
the board we had Buck Wirus with the association

17:43.831 --> 18:13.365
John Lindsay was the chairman or the president of 
the association that year and they endorsed it so

17:43.831 --> 18:13.365
we had a number are there some other people that you 
can think of that deserve credit I don't think so

18:14.307 --> 18:35.404
Now, as I have heard, this is hearsay, on racial 
integration, the way Mr. Rutter really made it

18:14.307 --> 18:35.404
come about, that he called Washington and told the 
Defense Department when they sent this year's

18:14.307 --> 18:35.404
group of enlisted men at Army expense to come down 
here and finish their degree, that include in this

18:36.127 --> 18:39.331
year's group some minority students. I never 
heard that. Well, as I understood it, and that then

18:40.612 --> 18:51.024
I understood that he called Mr. Heaton in and said, 
okay, Lloyd, you review all of their transcripts.

18:51.044 --> 18:55.649
They've assured me that they won't send anybody 
whose grades are in doubt and who's in trouble or

18:51.044 --> 18:55.649
anything. You check them out, be sure they're all, 
and then you call every instructor every teacher

19:02.063 --> 19:19.422
who's going to have one of these in class and tell 
them that these students have been admitted,

19:02.063 --> 19:19.422
everything is in order, and I had heard myself Mr. 
Heaton say a year or two earlier, over my dead body

19:02.063 --> 19:19.422
will we ever have black students here. You know, 
all I can remember Earl saying, I think I remember

19:20.203 --> 19:24.848
him saying this, that instead of having them out in 
the line to register, which he had them come inside

19:24.997 --> 19:34.994
and registered them, they weren't ever out in the 
line, and then they just appeared in their

19:24.997 --> 19:34.994
classes. And I don't remember a single mumble. I 
don't either. A single anything. And there again.

19:43.428 --> 19:44.109
Pretty smooth. And it worked well, and it began in 
the summer. So that then when the fall semester

19:48.267 --> 19:52.132
began, nobody could say it wouldn't work. It had 
worked smoothly as could be. Do you remember any

19:55.817 --> 20:06.893
individuals coming up to either of you to complain 
or to cheer about any of these changes? I remember.

20:12.179 --> 20:14.062
You mentioned Charlie Babcock. We ran into him in 
an airport one time, and he just turned his head.

20:17.707 --> 20:18.027
Really? He didn't speak. But as far as minorities, 
I don't know of anything, really. I never heard

20:29.163 --> 20:30.265
any. The only thing was when Dick Bernard was 
Earl's assistant. That was down the line

20:34.291 --> 20:35.653
sometimes. I remember him. There was a group of 
them, black students, that came in Earl was in the

20:42.183 --> 21:07.971
hospital with his blood pressure and Dick wanted 
he came from the office over to me said he just

20:42.183 --> 21:07.971
needed to go down tell her what had happened I said 
oh Dick I said he's down there with high blood

20:42.183 --> 21:07.971
pressure let's don't let's don't bother him but he 
went anyway well Earl couldn't get out of there

20:42.183 --> 21:07.971
fast enough they were going to come back the next 
day and did But Earl just talked to them, said, is

21:09.892 --> 21:14.357
there anything that's keeping you from getting 
your education here? They couldn't think of a

21:15.839 --> 21:17.982
thing that was keeping them from it. So he said, 
well, just go back and hit your books. What were

21:20.946 --> 21:22.207
they complaining about? Don't know. But they were 
marching on the office. And they whipped out these

21:27.133 --> 21:31.058
ID cards so fast that Dick didn't know what was 
going on. I don't know what's become of him. I

21:34.202 --> 21:35.443
haven't heard of him in a long time. He got his PhD at 
University of Houston, I understand. Right. I

21:39.490 --> 21:47.382
interviewed Ed Cooper not long ago, up at his place 
at the lake, and he's enjoying life. Oh yeah. Now

21:49.325 --> 21:59.119
let's see, and he told me that, maybe I mentioned 
this to you a while ago, he told me that he thought

21:49.325 --> 21:59.119
LBJ was also a positive factor in encouraging 
co-education and non-compulsory core. I didn't

22:03.547 --> 22:05.270
know he had an opinion even. He could have had, but I 
don't know. He said he thought that on one of the

22:07.414 --> 22:20.196
occasions when Mr. Rutter went to Washington to 
try to find some more federal money, that he said,

22:07.414 --> 22:20.196
because I realized after he came back from that 
trip, he was more positive about, let's go ahead

22:20.767 --> 22:23.790
and do it. Yeah. And he said... Could have been. I 
don't know. And I think I can imagine Lyndon

22:26.614 --> 22:31.860
Johnson putting his arm around somebody's 
shoulder and giving them... He was pretty good at

22:31.880 --> 22:33.181
encouraging. That's what I've heard. That's what 
I've heard. Yeah. Let's see. Do you remember any

22:37.867 --> 22:46.937
anecdotes of Rutter and Teague or Rutter and Lupo, 
those classmates? Of course, Earl and... And

22:49.825 --> 22:52.248
Tiger were close buddies. That's what I 
understood. Oh, yeah, definitely. He got a little

22:56.854 --> 23:01.279
disturbed about Lupo. Oh, really? Oh, you know, he 
had a hand in when they stole the mascots and all

23:03.002 --> 23:08.068
that kind of thing. Oh, that's right. Oh, he liked 
him. But, you know, I have a picture taken at the

23:12.173 --> 23:17.740
time Earl was inaugurated of all the ones of his 
class that were here for the inauguration. And I

23:23.619 --> 23:26.823
honestly don't know how many are left now. This 
Arthur Sherlock is still living. At least I

23:30.107 --> 23:31.429
haven't heard he died. But most of them are gone. 
And I told Bubba Lupo, Lupo's son, that I had a

23:40.400 --> 23:42.962
picture if he wanted to get a copy of it. Now, let's 
see, Class of 32. Maggie McGee was Class 31. Maggie

23:49.268 --> 23:50.529
was a good friend. Oh, yes, yes. And you know, a lot 
of people didn't understand when they named the

23:52.951 --> 23:59.317
administration building for Connolly. Well, he 
did more for higher education when he was governor

24:00.878 --> 24:08.365
than almost anybody.

24:08.817 --> 24:17.065
Maggie provided the plane, and they had all 
different heads of different schools would fly

24:08.817 --> 24:17.065
all over the place for stuff. I don't know. I didn't 
understand it. Earl didn't explain it to me. That

24:20.328 --> 24:37.744
spring of 62, when John Connolly was running for 
the Democratic nomination, again, Republican

24:20.328 --> 24:37.744
nomination didn't matter then, I went out to 
Easterwood Airport, and he landed in a DC-3 that

24:20.328 --> 24:37.744
somebody had loaned him that had an orange rudder. 
and he began his remarks by apologizing for

24:38.517 --> 25:08.288
landing on that airport with anything painted 
orange but he said this was loaned to me for free and

24:38.517 --> 25:08.288
if you know any Aggie that will loan me a maroon 
plane for free I'll use it he was a good governor did

24:38.517 --> 25:08.288
y'all visit while they were governor did y'all 
visit with the Connolly's son I don't remember we

24:38.517 --> 25:08.288
were close to the shivers Okay. But I don't know 
that... So you were... But we knew the Connellys.

25:13.356 --> 25:13.596
Yes. And any time that he was down here, you know, I 
was...

25:14.697 --> 25:28.629
Now, of your president wife days, what did you 
enjoy most? What events? What activities? Oh, I

25:33.053 --> 25:33.733
don't know. I enjoyed it, you know.

25:40.162 --> 25:45.109
I'll tell you, after moving over in the current 
president's house, I enjoyed the flowers. You

25:45.790 --> 25:51.358
know, they had those raised beds, and I did flower 
arrangements to my heart content. I love to do

25:52.339 --> 25:53.401
that. Let's jump back to the fire. Okay. That is 
the... 26th of January, 63. That's what I thought.

26:00.571 --> 26:03.855
During the old exam period, and... It was between 
semesters. That's what I mean, yeah. And... It

26:10.013 --> 26:12.938
happens during, begins during the daytime, 
doesn't it? At noon. And I called. Earl was still

26:15.782 --> 26:20.750
over at the office, and he was to have lunch with the 
board of the former students. And I called over

26:22.072 --> 26:26.279
there, and I said, now, Earl, don't get excited, 
but the house is on fire. I didn't want him to have a

26:26.980 --> 26:30.486
heart attack or something, but... Actually, what 
happened, we had this black man named George

26:31.276 --> 26:35.920
Washington. Of course, the kids made up a story 
about him and said, you'd call over there, and this

26:36.601 --> 26:41.405
man's voice would answer. He'd say, President's 
House, George Washington speaking. Well, that

26:44.828 --> 26:45.769
was not so. George would run when the phone rang. 
His favorite thing to do was going outside and

26:48.652 --> 26:53.756
sweeping the walk so he could watch the students 
walk by. He did that endlessly. But that day, it was

26:57.200 --> 27:01.063
Saturday, it burned.

27:03.119 --> 27:05.802
It was a cold, cold and windy day. And they had 
painted the house in the fall. We were just so lucky

27:09.205 --> 27:14.710
that it didn't happen at night because most of the 
windows upstairs were stuck. And we always felt

27:16.272 --> 27:20.756
like we were very lucky in that department. But 
George wanted to go to the bank, which was open

27:23.078 --> 27:27.423
until noon on Saturday. And so he called up. to me 
and wanted to go. And I said, OK. Well, unbeknownst

27:32.991 --> 27:39.957
to me, he just loaded the fireplace with firewood. 
And they came over after the fire, the fire chief

27:40.999 --> 27:50.668
did and asked, said, well, hadn't they cleaned the 
chimney every year? I said, we've been in it five

27:50.748 --> 27:54.092
years and they had never cleaned the chimney. So 
the soot caught fire up there. And there was a

27:57.595 --> 28:01.459
former black man that had worked there for the 
Okay, I know their name sometime, and other times I

28:02.536 --> 28:06.161
can't think of it. Who was president just before 
Earl? David? Morgan. Morgan. I started to say

28:10.127 --> 28:10.928
Morgan. I knew that wasn't right. Morgan. He had 
worked for them, and he said that it caught fire up

28:12.811 --> 28:24.006
there once before, and he said he threw a handful of 
salt onto the burning wood, and it snuffed it out. I

28:24.687 --> 28:26.230
didn't know you could do such a thing. I didn't 
either. Haven't ever tried that. So you all

28:28.673 --> 28:30.756
discovered this at lunchtime? Well, what 
happened? I didn't discover it. There were two men

28:34.464 --> 28:41.273
in a pickup that were driving by, and they said 
there was just a little flame around where the

28:34.464 --> 28:41.273
chimney came out the roof. And they said, the house 
is on fire. Well, Linda and Jane had not even

28:44.457 --> 28:47.461
dressed. It was the days of wearing moo-moos, so 
they were in their moo-moos. And Linda ran and

28:51.666 --> 28:59.956
looked up in the attic, and she said if she'd have 
had a fire extinguisher, she could have put it out.

28:59.996 --> 29:01.298
It was such a small... blame then but anyway the 
first fire truck that came so the fire chief told us

29:02.020 --> 29:17.532
he was so excited about what was burning that he 
didn't turn the right thing in his fire truck and

29:02.020 --> 29:17.532
the water was not reaching where the flame was so 
this wind hit it and it's an old frame you know just

29:18.102 --> 29:45.392
all right now when did the when did it begin what 
time of day oh right at noon right at right at noon

29:18.102 --> 29:45.392
all right and by what time did you all decide you had 
uh well see Earl I don't think Earl ever came inside

29:18.102 --> 29:45.392
I made three racing trips Earl was getting you know 
as I said I kept his uniform for 33 years that we were

29:46.115 --> 29:51.982
married before he died, he just left it up to me to 
keep his uniforms ready to go. And he was to go to

29:52.382 --> 29:54.965
Washington for some military meeting. And I had 
been pressing that uniform, polishing the brass,

29:55.826 --> 29:59.731
which is over on the dresser. And anyway, so I 
grabbed the uniform and raced downstairs with it.

30:06.518 --> 30:10.583
And he had bought me a first stole, so I'd look 
pretty nice for his inauguration. I thought, I

30:11.304 --> 30:15.008
better get that on, won't get another one.

30:17.148 --> 30:43.965
those two things that i went downstairs and got his 
military overcoat and his hat whatever you call it

30:17.148 --> 30:43.965
put those in the car happened to be at the back in the 
driveway at the back and so i just threw him in the

30:17.148 --> 30:43.965
car then i went back and got oh on the rod about this 
much i got i could see the two newest suits that i had

30:17.148 --> 30:43.965
i thought i've got to have something to wear so Oh, 
and we'd change the beds that morning, and in the

30:44.350 --> 30:55.322
laundry bag I'd put, because shoes were always a 
problem for me, and I'd put three pairs of shoes and

30:44.350 --> 30:55.322
then dropped it over the stairwell. But I made 
three trips. I went and got things that Ann had

30:58.005 --> 31:00.728
brought home from school. She was home between 
semesters. Then a few things out of Bob's room. And

31:05.873 --> 31:14.222
when I started down the stairway, the third trip 
that I was making, I got choked on the smoke, and the

31:05.873 --> 31:14.222
fireman... told me in no uncertain terms to get 
outside and not come back in. So I did. And I

31:19.545 --> 31:25.854
remember a guy that was from here, but he worked for 
the Daily Texan. And he wrote a column, of course,

31:25.874 --> 31:29.700
and got the paper. And he said that I had noticed 
smoke coming through the walls most of the

31:30.802 --> 31:37.031
morning, but I hadn't thought anything about it. I 
thought, that makes me sound like an idiot. And I

31:40.207 --> 31:42.330
brought it up to him one time much later on. He said 
he didn't remember it. Anyway,

31:44.212 --> 31:50.601
Doris Hannigan somehow appeared on the scene and 
took me over to her house.

31:53.424 --> 31:57.730
What did you all lose that was sentimentally 
priceless? Up in the attic I had so many boxes of

31:58.111 --> 32:04.459
clippings from the war, like from the 
Philadelphia War.
