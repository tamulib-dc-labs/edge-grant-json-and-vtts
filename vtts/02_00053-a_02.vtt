WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:10.481
He understood what the mission of Student Affairs 
was all about and was able to put most of that in

00:03.355 --> 00:10.481
practice while he was here. Because when he was, he 
really started the Division of Student Affairs,

00:10.541 --> 00:18.449
or Student Services back then it was called, at 
Texas A&M University. And he still refers to a

00:19.570 --> 00:31.320
paper that he wrote at Christmas time in 1973 about 
what his goals were for the division. And over

00:31.688 --> 00:35.331
time, he put almost every one of them in place. Now, 
he came here only a few months before you did,

00:36.352 --> 00:38.995
didn't he? He was here about two or three months 
before I was. That's right. Okay. What he put into

00:42.038 --> 00:48.564
place, well, in the long run, recreational 
sportsmen made it to student affairs. That took a

00:48.644 --> 00:50.265
few years. But he started the personal counseling 
center, which is now called the student

00:50.986 --> 00:55.751
counseling center. That didn't exist at that 
time. He brought it in. the health center over to

01:00.376 --> 01:02.659
him. At one time the police were in student 
affairs. Student financial aid he brought into

01:07.704 --> 01:10.768
student affairs. There's a lot of things that he 
wrote about in that paper that happened over the

01:11.469 --> 01:19.818
next 10 years. By 83 most of those things are in 
place. And then describe McCandless

01:23.442 --> 01:25.865
personality. Charles McCandless was energetic, 
bright, always had a smile on his face. He's the

01:36.297 --> 01:37.858
best customer, one of the best. We have several 
long-term customers. But he started playing

01:41.563 --> 01:48.030
handball and racquetball with Buck Henderson. 
Buck was a student and Charles was the director of

01:49.372 --> 01:53.437
intramurals. And I'm not sure what year that was, 
but it was probably in the early 60s. Well, they

01:59.135 --> 02:01.439
still play three times a week. Charles, this was 
after Charles left here to be the vice president of

02:02.761 --> 02:17.808
Iowa State, retired, came back, became a member 
again, and now they're playing again, but great

02:02.761 --> 02:17.808
customer, great friend, and very bright. You 
know, he's always fun to be around because he's

02:19.170 --> 02:23.438
always got a good story.

02:25.173 --> 02:33.723
In those early years, did you run into any 
obstacles as intramurals was growing? No, it was

02:36.266 --> 02:40.231
interesting because we were growing so fast. We 
were growing by almost 100. About four years in a

02:42.073 --> 02:48.460
row, our major team sports were growing from 100 to 
200, 300 to 400 teams. It was expanding that

02:49.602 --> 02:51.484
rapidly. What happened to us is we would run out of 
money in April or May. And what I had to do is write a

03:01.407 --> 03:09.857
letter to Dr. Coles and say, this is what we 
budgeted for, this is what we've experienced. We

03:09.937 --> 03:11.679
were out of money, can you help us? And he was able to 
help us. No, there really were no major obstacles.

03:20.388 --> 03:30.524
The people we worked with, from Dr. Lamas to Dr. 
Coles, the presidents that were in place, were

03:20.388 --> 03:30.524
always very supportive. In that time, we built the 
original Penberthy Fields here, and then we built

03:30.584 --> 03:42.824
another set of fields that are now called 
Penberthy Intramural Sports Center. We built the

03:44.707 --> 03:48.032
Reed Building. And that was primarily Carl 
Landis' project and then we built this village. So

03:55.520 --> 03:59.487
we haven't had a lack of support. In those years 
when there was rapid growth, the expenses were for

03:59.507 --> 04:09.482
what, referees? Primarily for referees. Where 
did you get those officials? Same place we get them

04:13.729 --> 04:14.750
now. We advertise. All of our officials are 
students.

04:22.978 --> 04:42.337
What we try to accomplish, and probably are as good 
at this as anybody, is taking somebody who's never

04:22.978 --> 04:42.337
officiated a game, and that's 75% of our people in 
every sport, every year, never officiated

04:22.978 --> 04:42.337
before, and put them through a training program 
that gives them an opportunity to be successful at

04:22.978 --> 04:42.337
officiating. That's one of the toughest jobs 
there is. But that's our approach to it and that's

04:44.392 --> 04:47.799
the way we've done that. We employ right now 1,100 
different students a year. About 500 of those are

04:51.306 --> 04:53.149
officials. Now what was the compensation for them 
in the early years and what is it now? Now they're

05:01.305 --> 05:05.353
starting at about $5.25 an hour. Back then, the 
minimum wage, you may have to help me with this, the

05:07.308 --> 05:15.437
minimum wage was probably $2 or $2.50 an hour, 
somewhere there. So it's normally been minimum

05:15.477 --> 05:17.078
wage? Right now, they're just a little bit above 
minimum wage. But for most of the years I've been

05:21.243 --> 05:25.467
here, officials have been paid minimum wage. 
Describe the shift that must have occurred as

05:26.208 --> 05:35.678
intramurals went from being predominantly core 
to, I presume, predominantly non-core. It was a

05:37.210 --> 05:39.953
pretty smooth transition in reality. The student 
body at the time I got here was predominantly

05:39.993 --> 05:45.679
non-reported. There was probably 2,000 in the 
Corps and 16,000 in the Army. But back then, there

05:50.024 --> 05:56.371
was some fairly sharp divides, as you can imagine. 
And you had Corps non-reqs, is what they called

05:56.391 --> 06:01.356
them. And we did some scheduling that... that 
helped them really compete against each other in a

06:06.843 --> 06:12.451
more pleasant way. And I think in time it became 
Aggies, you know, the one competition with Aggies

06:13.453 --> 06:22.827
as opposed to Corps versus none or any kind of deal. 
But the transition really went pretty smooth.

06:27.875 --> 06:34.825
Were there ever any incidents that you remember in 
the Corps, non-Corps? There was some pretty

06:36.543 --> 06:40.789
healthy competition, but really no incidents. 
Our students here, when you put them in a

06:41.610 --> 06:50.121
competitive situation, follow the rules. They 
don't hassle the officials. It's one of the best

06:53.165 --> 06:55.869
competitive situations you'll ever see. They're 
good sports. Who did the training of the new

06:58.592 --> 07:02.297
officials? That was me to begin with, and then I had 
an assistant director my first year here, Jim

07:03.256 --> 07:16.286
Peter, and he took that job over, and then John 
Meyer, who's now in Colorado. But it's always

07:17.368 --> 07:20.455
been, as I always say, We've had anywhere from one 
to four people in our intramural program. And

07:25.310 --> 07:27.273
their primary job is training. They have to be good 
teachers. They have to know their sports. They

07:29.437 --> 07:31.580
have to know the rules. But the primary thing is 
they have to know how to teach, because they're

07:32.221 --> 07:37.970
teaching people a job skill. Which would be, were 
the easiest and the most difficult officials to

07:39.012 --> 07:45.121
locate?

07:47.685 --> 07:49.328
Volleyball is the easiest. And we, in Texas, have a 
good supply of women playing volleyball in high

07:49.730 --> 07:59.664
school. They understand the sport very well. And 
they're willing to officiate. And softball is

08:07.315 --> 08:09.838
fairly easy to officiate, too. The ones that are 
most difficult is basketball. I mean, it's the

08:16.087 --> 08:18.150
hardest sport to officiate. Even though there's a 
lot of people playing it, there's not many people

08:20.105 --> 08:25.000
that really want to call off any. And everybody's 
so close together in that game. Football is tough

08:29.588 --> 08:38.399
because everybody thinks they know football 
until they try to officiate it, and then they

08:29.588 --> 08:38.399
realize how little they know about the game. Rules 
in football are a little more difficult than they

08:38.419 --> 08:45.969
are in the other sports, and they're more 
difficult to enforce. Right. In those early

08:46.270 --> 08:56.743
years, as you looked at what we were doing and not 
doing, are there any that you thought that we

08:46.270 --> 08:56.743
should have been doing that we were not? Are you 
surprised we weren't? I was a little concerned

09:01.408 --> 09:17.297
when I first got here that the way we were 
supervising recreation, drop-in recreation,

09:01.408 --> 09:17.297
and the way we were securing facilities and 
managing facilities for the safety of the

09:01.408 --> 09:17.297
participants. That was one of the 
recommendations I made to Dr. Landis.

09:29.513 --> 09:41.346
And that's really what he was looking for, because 
from somebody who had been involved in physical

09:29.513 --> 09:41.346
education and not necessarily managing 
facilities, that's kind of what he was looking

09:29.513 --> 09:41.346
for, somebody to say, we really need to do this.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.453
Any sports that you added? we've had just about 
every sport that you can imagine here. That's the

09:53.965 --> 09:55.107
thing that's fun about it. It's creative. You go to 
conferences, you find new sports, you introduce

09:55.847 --> 10:00.093
them here, and they work. Some examples. Well, 
flickerball is an Aggie sport. You won't see that

10:05.900 --> 10:07.201
anyplace else. Flicker? Is that one word or two? 
Two words. Actually, it's one word, flickerball.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.613
And that's a football passing game. But after you 
catch the ball, you have to stop. You can't run with

10:19.202 --> 10:20.324
the ball. So it's a football passing game, and it's 
a combination of football skills and basketball

10:21.004 --> 10:27.071
skills. Pass the ball, catch the ball, and you end 
up throwing it through a target, a goal. A board

10:33.317 --> 10:39.043
that looks like a basketball backboard, but it's 
got a hole in the center of it. It goes through, you

10:39.063 --> 10:40.405
score three points. If you hit the ball, you score 
one point. So it has soccer kind of skills,

10:42.108 --> 10:47.535
basketball kind of skills, and football skills. 
Is it a round ball or a, oh it's a football, okay.

10:52.101 --> 10:53.463
You're throwing a football. And that's an Aggie 
game. That one's been most popular for many years.

10:58.009 --> 10:59.170
It's pretty well died out now. It's, the primary 
reason it's died out is it's a really difficult

10:59.311 --> 11:04.097
game to officiate. You can't find anybody to 
officiate if they want to. Inner tube water

11:08.872 --> 11:11.556
sports, that was pretty interesting. Inner tube 
water polo and inner tube water basketball. It

11:14.781 --> 11:20.410
took a game that's really tough to play, put people 
in inner tubes and they have a lot of fun with it. So

11:20.430 --> 11:22.734
that was a pretty good one. Pickleball is a game 
played with a wooden paddle and a wiffle ball over a

11:22.834 --> 11:35.754
badminton net that's on a badminton court, but the 
badminton net is lowered down to like a tennis net.

11:35.774 --> 11:37.056
It's called pickleball. some really strange.

11:42.058 --> 11:45.542
Look and see if there's any others that I can't 
think of right off the top of my head.

11:54.312 --> 11:56.734
One of the things we're doing now is fantasy 
football. So it's not it's not an active sport. But

12:00.218 --> 12:04.242
it's, it's very much sports related fantasy 
footballs. indoor soccer. That, gosh, last year

12:08.305 --> 12:12.289
we had 197 teams in indoor soccer. Played on a 
basketball arena? Yeah. When you look at it into

12:15.733 --> 12:24.001
our facility area, our indoor soccer court is 
about 208 feet long and about 85 feet wide. But it's

12:24.021 --> 12:27.185
got boards like an ice arena. But when you got here 
from the University of Texas, as you looked at the

12:27.565 --> 12:36.034
array of things we were doing, are there some that 
we were not, that you were a little surprised we

12:27.565 --> 12:36.034
weren't doing? No, it was a fairly broad program. 
You know, I think the main thing that we added was

12:39.101 --> 12:44.769
women's leagues and co-ed leagues. And then a few 
years later we added the skill levels. And that

12:49.236 --> 12:51.540
really made a big difference. The things that we 
didn't really have a handle on was facility

12:51.560 --> 13:03.237
supervision for free play, sports clubs, There 
really was no organizational structure for

13:03.672 --> 13:12.229
sports clubs and that's something I started about 
two years after I got here and got funding through

13:03.672 --> 13:12.229
Dr. Cole to support. Outdoor

13:13.331 --> 13:25.495
recreation was being managed by a committee at the 
Student Center and in time that came over to us. But

13:26.842 --> 13:31.849
that one, we had to play the politics right, so we 
didn't take it away from them. They ended up

13:31.869 --> 13:34.312
saying, here it is. But we went from an intramural 
program to a comprehensive recreational sports

13:35.934 --> 13:40.540
program. And part of that was, when I got here, I 
knew two things. Sports clubs and facility

13:45.186 --> 13:47.850
management, we had to do. And that's from my 
experience in Texas. And then over the years of

13:50.453 --> 13:51.955
going to participating in our national 
associations. You know, you pick up on things that

13:56.522 --> 13:59.685
you could be, should be doing. Now, the athletic 
director on paper when you arrived, I guess, was

13:59.705 --> 14:04.171
Emory Ballard. Correct. In fact, who in the 
athletic department did you work with most?

14:10.498 --> 14:11.139
Marvin Tate. Marvin, who was at that time 
associate, I believe. Right. And was that

14:15.744 --> 14:18.628
pleasant, easy? Yeah. Marvin was good to work 
with.

14:24.284 --> 14:26.366
Of course, he later became Mayor Bryan. He was a 
good politician. He took care of himself first,

14:29.530 --> 14:37.840
his programs first, but he was not unwilling to 
help us whenever we needed help. We started one of

14:38.501 --> 14:50.375
the first, we call it varsity level two programs in 
the country, where we elevated water polo into a

14:38.501 --> 14:50.375
varsity status without scholarship. It was kind 
of a division three. model program within a

14:52.837 --> 14:56.202
Division I program. It's kind of unusual. We did 
that with soccer and with, so we did some creative

14:57.444 --> 15:04.636
things with Marvin. He was willing to work with us. 
All right. Then he became athletic director, in

15:06.139 --> 15:13.170
fact, in about 77 or 8. So did you continue to work 
with him or was there a subordinate? We probably

15:18.807 --> 15:22.794
started working with Walter Groff more after 
Marvin became the director. All right. And then

15:24.477 --> 15:34.854
did, as the football, head football coach 
changed, did that cause any trouble, any change

15:24.477 --> 15:34.854
for you all? Not really because the two, you know, 
the people that have been here for most of the time

15:35.615 --> 15:41.946
I've been here, Billy Picker is the facility 
manager for the athletic department, and Wally

15:42.905 --> 15:49.834
Groff has been there the whole time. And we still 
communicate with those two people most of the

15:50.414 --> 15:53.679
time. Describe some of the realities of the 
expansion of the women's involvement in

15:54.560 --> 16:00.968
intramurals. There must have been some unique 
experiences occasionally.

16:12.942 --> 16:14.324
Well, that's a pretty good question. Okay. They 
explode in numbers, I presume, don't they? Yeah,

16:19.994 --> 16:22.238
the numbers grew pretty rapidly. I guess the one 
thing that was kind of exciting was at that time,

16:22.518 --> 16:30.472
Title IX was just coming out. 1973 or so, I think, 
was the year of Title IX. And we were dealing with it

16:36.362 --> 16:38.646
because we had in 74 or 75 because we started a 
sports club program and Kay Don, who was in

16:39.166 --> 16:53.307
physical education at the time, had kind of done a 
women's sports organization of some kind. She

16:53.327 --> 17:00.538
came in with us with a sports club organization 
that we put together. So Kay and I worked together

17:01.039 --> 17:03.823
for two or three years heading women towards some 
kind of a varsity setting. I'm not sure we knew we

17:10.077 --> 17:18.071
were doing that, but all of a sudden it happened and 
we had a women's varsity program and she was the

17:10.077 --> 17:18.071
athletic director for women at that time. And that 
was kind of fun to kind of start that and watch it

17:19.052 --> 17:27.787
develop and then really see it come to full 
fruition with a women's varsity program. So from

17:28.568 --> 17:31.633
the varsity side, that was pretty exciting stuff. 
It was just fun to...

17:39.131 --> 17:42.515
The other schools had the men's program and the 
women's program. It was just fun to see here how

17:42.575 --> 17:53.228
sport developed and it wasn't so much men, women. 
It was more Aggies. The co-work program really was

17:57.974 --> 18:00.777
much bigger than the women's program. We had a lot 
more women playing in the co-rec program, which is

18:01.280 --> 18:04.184
good. It's a good socialization time. But the 
women's program grew steadily and is very

18:06.347 --> 18:09.432
positive. One of the things that I think is pretty 
interesting kind of relates to your question,

18:09.472 --> 18:13.518
though. It was pretty interesting in the 70s 
especially to have, and this name John and I were

18:15.401 --> 18:25.195
just talking about this weekend, Debbie Pistone. 
probably the best official we've ever had. And

18:28.374 --> 18:33.559
she's out there officiating in Class A men's 
basketball in the mid-70s. Now that's pretty

18:34.980 --> 18:36.061
exciting. Guys walk on the court, and they're the 
top of their league in Class A men's basketball.

18:43.928 --> 18:46.510
And this young woman comes on the court with a 
whistle in her mouth. And she controls the game.

18:47.952 --> 18:48.692
She runs the game. Afterwards, they understand 
how good she is. Did any of them try to stare her

18:51.575 --> 18:55.198
down? Oh yeah, there's always, the problem that 
women face in officiating is intimidation

18:55.415 --> 19:01.082
factor. And some of them doesn't bother at all. 
Some good officials have trouble getting by that.

19:07.028 --> 19:08.470
Have any idea where she is now? I don't. I don't. 
We're going to look her up though. Interesting to

19:10.633 --> 19:13.376
know where she went to. Did, no particular 
incidents in women in the correct leagues? Now,

19:22.853 --> 19:28.440
flag football was one of the major sports. What 
would be the typical makeup of a team? Was there a

19:32.485 --> 19:36.810
certain percentage of men and women that had to be 
on the field? Yes. We played around with this a

19:38.593 --> 19:42.938
little bit, but I think we ended up with six women 
and six men on the team. And there could only be one,

19:43.306 --> 19:50.538
we had rules like there could be only one 
male-to-male pass in a four-down series. So it

19:51.339 --> 19:54.585
forced you to pass to women or have women passing to 
men. I used to play on the team. We always had a staff

19:57.990 --> 20:06.244
team. It was really interesting because Tara 
Shipley was her name. She's related to John Coldis

20:09.091 --> 20:14.757
through Todd Shipley, who's his son-in-law. 
Melissa and Todd Shipley. And he says, I have a

20:19.483 --> 20:22.226
student who needs to work. This is one of his 
Wednesday morning meetings. I have a student who

20:25.769 --> 20:26.891
needs a job. She's transferring from the 
University of Texas.

20:38.521 --> 20:42.931
She just happened to have a job. She came over to 
work. The reason she had transferred down here is

20:46.019 --> 20:50.590
her fiance played football for the Aggies. Her 
name was Ray Childress. She not only turned out to

20:54.164 --> 20:57.770
be probably the best student worker we ever had. 
She was sharp as a tack, energetic, creative, and

20:58.651 --> 21:06.123
just a hard worker. But she was also one of the best 
football players we had on our staff team. She'd

21:11.092 --> 21:13.896
never played flag football before she got out 
there. She had hands of glue. You threw it anywhere

21:15.258 --> 21:17.201
closer, she could get it. But the Ray Childress, He

21:21.755 --> 21:28.185
would come to every game and he would hold the downs 
marker on the side. And in one game we were playing

21:28.205 --> 21:41.906
in, she was playing on defense and the ball went in 
the air and one of our guys, she was a pretty good

21:28.205 --> 21:41.906
size guy, was running towards the ball and she was 
in the way. He didn't see it because he was looking

21:41.946 --> 21:43.589
at the ball. He just ran right over her and she hits 
the ground, boom. and Ray is on the sideline, he

21:46.882 --> 21:53.469
throws that thing down and comes chugging out, you 
okay, you okay? And she was, she was fine. I don't

21:54.871 --> 21:59.616
know how she came through it without big bruises, 
but it was funny to see. He really was taking care of

21:59.856 --> 22:01.137
her. Now, in flag football there is blocking. It's 
non-contact blocking. Oh. And we instituted that

22:13.882 --> 22:16.866
That was probably one of the tougher things we did 
in the first couple years we were here. I think it

22:17.127 --> 22:20.972
was the second year I was here I said we're gonna, we 
did it in Texas. And I had, part of the study I did

22:21.553 --> 22:30.846
when I first got into this field with Lynn Reading 
and Iowa State was to compare injury rates,

22:21.553 --> 22:30.846
contact blocking, non-contact blocking. And 
that was a study we reported on out at Los Angeles

22:30.866 --> 22:35.432
when I met the guys from Texas. And Texas used 
non-contact. When I came down here we used full

22:38.416 --> 22:40.199
contact. So the second year I instituted it. And 
it's more like what you see in basketball, only you

22:42.940 --> 22:52.872
can use a moving screen in football. You can't use a 
moving screen in basketball. You'd call for it.

22:58.659 --> 22:59.981
It's not like a moving screen. You try to position 
yourself between, and the person rushing the

23:00.001 --> 23:04.106
passer has to go around as opposed to through you. 
So it's a non-contact. And that was one of the

23:05.848 --> 23:11.935
things that allowed more people to enjoy 
football. Football was one of our, almost a minor

23:13.062 --> 23:18.676
sport until we instituted that. It grew with 
everything else because women could play without

23:19.317 --> 23:23.848
fear of getting in their face. smashed and guys 
good too first when I was at Iowa State the year

23:24.588 --> 23:49.836
before I went to Texas I played on a staff team there 
and after the first game two guys had to go get their

23:24.588 --> 23:49.836
teeth now the flag the flag that is grabbed by the 
opponent is placed where now the ones we use have as

23:24.588 --> 23:49.836
a flag there's a belt and it has Flag on each side and 
one in the back. Oh, so one at each hip and one at the

23:52.001 --> 23:54.384
back. And if you grab one of the... Flags and the 
whole belt comes off. Okay. Okay. In terms of the

24:01.073 --> 24:07.122
co-ed sports, which ones were the most popular 
co-eds? Flag football and softball. And

24:09.425 --> 24:09.806
softball. Slow-pitch softball. Slow-pitch, 
which means the ball is pitched up and then down.

24:16.075 --> 24:18.057
Big arc, big arc kind of. Any fast-pitch softball 
at all? We probably had the biggest fast pitch

24:20.663 --> 24:26.176
lease in the country. But I think the last time we 
really offered it was 7879 and 734567 and along in

24:28.481 --> 24:36.580
there we had Quite a bit of fast pitch. Men and women 
or? Primarily men. Primarily men. Fast pitch for

24:42.120 --> 24:47.669
women really didn't get started until after, 
really after my daughter had graduated. That's

24:48.169 --> 24:49.271
new to me too. Yeah, that's about 87. Have there 
been any examples of an intramural participant

24:51.995 --> 24:58.666
going on to varsity sports? There are and I wish I 
could remember the name right now. We had a A kid who

25:04.775 --> 25:11.784
played basketball in Emeralds and Shelby 
actually picked him up way back then.

25:16.811 --> 25:18.874
I think that's the only one that I can think of. I 
think we had one in Texas too when I was there. Which

25:22.920 --> 25:30.630
coaches, varsity coaches, were the most helpful 
to y'all in whatever sports? For the most part, we

25:32.804 --> 25:38.874
dealt with Billy Pickard on facilities, because 
he had some hand in managing all the facilities.

25:41.678 --> 25:44.242
You know, Edward Millard was a good guy to work 
with. He really was.

25:48.890 --> 25:49.711
And R.C. was really good to work with in football.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.305
Mark Johnson. We use this facility every year. 
Just a gentleman of the guy. I don't think we've all

26:05.722 --> 26:06.963
been there.

26:12.808 --> 26:15.231
We've enjoyed a good relationship with all the 
coaches. I can't think of any specific incidents

26:15.271 --> 26:20.175
that's been a problem. All right, let's go then 
from the 70s, move forward. Describe how things

26:25.480 --> 26:28.022
changed. were modified. Well, the basic change 
was going from strictly an intramural program,

26:31.431 --> 26:45.536
which was designed to provide competition,

26:31.431 --> 26:45.536
on-campus competition for Aggies. And we grew 
that just about as big as it could grow. We were

26:49.082 --> 26:53.470
filling every space we had with sports 
activities. And what that created was a lack of

26:53.922 --> 27:00.571
opportunity for people to drop in and shoot hoops 
or play racquetball or whatever. We had classes

27:01.412 --> 27:05.218
that went essentially from eight to five in all the 
facilities we had. And we had intramurals that

27:05.438 --> 27:08.783
went from five to midnight. And there was two or 
three or four years that we were going until 2 a.m.

27:08.803 --> 27:15.172
with our building being open. And we were playing 
intramurals until 2 a.m. on a regular basis. We

27:20.199 --> 27:21.921
were just so packed with stuff. So our focus became 
one of trying to figure a way to create facilities.

27:30.316 --> 27:37.945
And we had built a lot of physical activity 
facilities that were primarily designed for

27:30.316 --> 27:37.945
physical education. And we started talking to the 
student body about building a recreation center

27:38.906 --> 27:50.199
similar to one that was built at Texas Tech in 1980, 
one that was built at Purdue in 1957, was probably

27:38.906 --> 27:50.199
the first one. But that whole genre of buildings 
started evolving and really evolving and we think

27:52.934 --> 28:16.242
you know we've got the jam in the country right now 
this particular facility but we started talking

27:52.934 --> 28:16.242
to their students about that and in 1987 let's do it 
they said let's do it now and that's when we had the

27:52.934 --> 28:16.242
vote the original referendum that said we're 
going to charge ourselves 50 to build this

27:52.934 --> 28:16.242
building all right and during during these years 
of transition and change

28:18.297 --> 28:48.000
which sports which activities compared to 
capability to handle which were the most over

28:18.297 --> 28:48.000
popular and the least compare the extremes

28:18.297 --> 28:48.000
well most popular intramural sport was the sports 
ebb and flow in popularity was softball. Slow

28:57.002 --> 29:04.895
pitch softball went from being

28:57.002 --> 29:04.895
in the mid 70s, probably 200 teams. We were right at 
120 teams in 74. In 1979, we had 810 teams enter the

29:10.846 --> 29:14.689
tournament. We didn't have a single lighted field 
on campus. So we were trying to figure out how to do

29:17.272 --> 29:19.754
that. But we did have about 25 fields at that time. 
We put backstops up any place you could find bloody

29:21.896 --> 29:26.280
grass, we had a backstop up. So that was really 
popular. In tennis, we went to about 1,200

29:28.822 --> 29:33.626
different participants in a tennis tournament at 
one time. Now it's down to around 200. So the sports

29:35.788 --> 29:40.212
kind of ebb and flow. popularity but I think the 
main thing that happened though is we kept saying

29:40.478 --> 30:10.367
that there there was a need for facility where 
people could come and play at their leisure

29:40.478 --> 30:10.367
participate at their leisure on their schedule 
not on our schedule and the thing that happened has

29:40.478 --> 30:10.367
the one in 1994-95

29:40.478 --> 30:10.367
our head count of people using our program was 
250,000 in 1995-96 when we opened this building it

29:40.478 --> 30:10.367
was 1,250,000 just in this building. So we know 
that there was a need for people to have a place to go

30:13.049 --> 30:21.380
recreate, and this building filled that need. 
That was probably the massive change. The other

30:24.984 --> 30:36.439
thing that happened with this building that we had 
intramurals, which was our biggest program, and

30:24.984 --> 30:36.439
we were reaching 48% of the student body in 
intramurals. Intramurals is primarily focused

30:37.803 --> 30:39.845
in men. Probably 90% of the participants in 
intramurals are men. Now when? Men. Now? Now. Then

30:47.413 --> 30:48.373
and now. Oh. It's always been that way. Okay. What 
happened when we opened this building is we were

30:52.417 --> 31:01.587
able to accommodate activities that women enjoy 
participating in. And if you look now, instead of

31:02.127 --> 31:07.152
our participants being 90% men 10% women it's 52% 
men 48% women so it's almost exactly the same as the

31:07.368 --> 31:26.035
enrollment it is if you look at it it's going to be 
exactly the same because we're reaching 70 to 75

31:07.368 --> 31:26.035
percent of the student body every semester so 
we're not going to vary from
