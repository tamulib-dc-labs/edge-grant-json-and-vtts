00:04.823 --> 00:14.216
Is there any price put on research, for example, 
for tenure or for any of the other? What is put on, I

00:14.236 --> 00:20.245
think, is imposed by a professor's own 
colleagues. Any decisions about tenure or

00:21.106 --> 00:29.698
promotion are initiated in the department. I 
think that's where the greatest pressure is put

00:29.718 --> 00:32.502
on. I'm sure that if we sent regularly professors 
who did not publish that the College of Education,

00:33.578 --> 00:43.994
Dean Corrigan in particular, would be very, very 
unhappy about it. But he's also taken the position

00:44.915 --> 00:53.448
that research is not the only way that a professor 
can excel, teaching is service. And so a minimum

00:53.468 --> 00:59.698
amount of research, publication, coupled with a 
great amount of service are great attention to

00:53.468 --> 00:59.698
students. And for us, the biggest part of teaching 
is not standing in the classroom at 25 or 30, the

01:02.924 --> 01:06.849
greatest part is doctoral advisement. And that 
also can play a role. And I think it's been very

01:12.395 --> 01:17.361
successful in selling this to the university. And 
yet, as I said, I don't think there ever has been a

01:18.643 --> 01:23.228
lot of pressure to research. Research, in fact, 
has expanded since when I first came within the

01:23.408 --> 01:27.073
department. But I think part of the... research 
has never been, the pressure has not been great, is

01:32.135 --> 01:48.938
that perhaps engineering is sort of the

01:32.135 --> 01:48.938
prototype of what A&M is all about, decreasingly 
so. Engineering, professors have never done a lot

01:50.820 --> 01:55.727
of research. In spite of the image, it's only a 
minority of their professors really been engaged

02:02.223 --> 02:04.967
in research. And a lot of them have done a lot of 
service. They've done small research projects.

02:10.895 --> 02:14.380
Not really any, the great majority are not 
consequential things. And they don't publish

02:15.101 --> 02:16.984
much at all. So I think that has taken some of the 
pressure off. OK. That takes us in. And I would like

02:23.674 --> 02:26.678
to just see if you have any either a highlight of 
your 10 years of A&M, something that stands out in

02:26.945 --> 02:52.741
your mind as something very special, or something 
about what you feel maybe in these 10 years has been

02:26.945 --> 02:52.741
your greatest contribution, and just an insight 
or an anecdote or some observation that you've

02:26.945 --> 02:52.741
made that would be, again, something that comes 
from just your own inner feelings and wouldn't be

02:26.945 --> 02:52.741
documented anywhere, just your own personal. 
Well, yeah. No. I guess I'll be egocentric in my

02:55.700 --> 03:24.272
response, too, because the thing of which

02:55.700 --> 03:24.272
I'm most proud of and I feel best about is the

02:55.700 --> 03:24.272
obviously powerful feeling of family and 
collegiality that I think we've developed in the

02:55.700 --> 03:24.272
Department of Educational Administration.

03:26.176 --> 03:28.598
It's something I've worked at. I haven't been 
alone in it, but the response has been great. And I

03:33.082 --> 03:54.681
don't think we've ever had, well, I don't know of 
any other department anywhere that has the same

03:33.082 --> 03:54.681
amount of collegiality, not only among 
professors, but among the graduate students,

03:33.082 --> 03:54.681
between student professors, and even to include 
the secretary of the classified staff. And I feel

03:55.488 --> 04:02.377
very good about that and the way that that has 
evolved and is evolving. Yeah, I thought

04:02.397 --> 04:04.179
everybody was the same. Not having been exposed to 
the other ones and having felt that camaraderie in

04:04.199 --> 04:12.870
the group itself there, I thought that was part of 
it. But that's good. Is there something you've

04:14.832 --> 04:18.537
done that's special that has created that? You 
said you work hard at it. What did you do to turn it

04:20.819 --> 04:23.723
around if it wasn't there? Well, a couple of 
things. Formal things is I have really stressed

04:27.202 --> 04:42.277
and continue to stress the fact that professors 
ought not to be in their own offices following only

04:27.202 --> 04:42.277
their own agendas, developing only their own 
excellence. But they also ought to be working on

04:42.297 --> 04:45.940
joint projects. Several professors ought to be 
working on the same project. They need to share.

04:50.585 --> 04:53.187
They need to involve each other. I've also, in 
pursuit of that, I've encouraged particular

04:54.128 --> 05:03.058
professors, two or three, to work together on the 
same thing or to bring another professor in. I've

05:04.560 --> 05:24.102
also explicitly stated that I would like to see 
more

05:04.560 --> 05:24.102
involvement with the students in researching on 
the really interesting things, more

05:04.560 --> 05:24.102
collegiality, and more chance for dialogue.

05:24.689 --> 05:39.666
I certainly haven't done this myself, but 
certainly there have been other people, any other

05:24.689 --> 05:39.666
professors who have been interested in this, and 
my main contribution there has been to encourage

05:24.689 --> 05:39.666
them. Stan Carpenter has come to build up the 
collegiology he has among the students involved

05:39.907 --> 05:46.134
in higher education. He needs to take primary 
credit for that. The only credit I feel is that I can

05:52.162 --> 05:55.186
take part in the green light and encourage them to 
do it. I'll also stress another thing that this

05:56.427 --> 06:02.955
department had in that, well, it was a very similar 
thing. And I've never issued a statement on it, a

06:03.015 --> 06:07.640
formal statement, that this is what had to be done.

06:11.885 --> 06:12.926
Excuse me. Oh, OK. Thanks. Thank you, Alonzo. 
That's OK.

06:22.891 --> 06:36.892
I've encouraged them to use their graduate 
assistants in really on the important things of

06:22.891 --> 06:36.892
the department, their research, their writing, 
et cetera, which they've done. And I've

06:37.193 --> 06:40.417
discouraged them. I said, don't give the graduate 
assistant all the experience of just doing

06:40.437 --> 06:47.909
formalistic gopher kinds of stuff. And I would 
say, when I came, that was probably the norm.

06:52.591 --> 06:55.556
requirements for the graduate assistant. And I 
think that's turned around very nicely. And I

06:58.460 --> 07:03.668
think these graduate assistants aren't getting 
paid enough in dollars. They ought to be getting

07:04.389 --> 07:09.417
something a lot more out of it than just the money. 
Very good. And in closing, is there anything that

07:12.081 --> 07:16.208
you would like to share? Some little incident or 
anecdote, anything that that, again, stands out

07:19.844 --> 07:36.127
as something that you feel pretty good about that 
has happened while you've been there, in or out of

07:19.844 --> 07:36.127
the department or in a relationship with other 
students, a particular student or a particular

07:19.844 --> 07:36.127
event or something that... I would say 
personally, you know, I was just sitting out from

07:36.267 --> 07:45.661
the department to be expanded, I guess, both to my 
interactions with students. Also, I think it also

07:46.302 --> 07:48.585
could be expanded to college generally, 
certainly I think one of the most rewarding

07:49.055 --> 08:08.182
things, maybe the most rewarding thing since I've 
been here is the tremendous number of good

07:49.055 --> 08:08.182
doctoral students I've been privileged to work 
with and some really good research that they've

07:49.055 --> 08:08.182
done and gotten to know them and to understand them 
and to help them along the way. The second thing

08:09.824 --> 08:15.552
that was in that same vein is that I think It's just 
been a real joy, just a very refreshing experience

08:16.493 --> 08:27.963
to have Dean Corrigan here just to open up the 
possibilities and encourage in so many areas.

08:31.847 --> 08:40.274
I cannot imagine another individual whom we could 
have selected for the position that would have

08:31.847 --> 08:40.274
done a better job. And speaking, I guess, to my own 
deficits as a As in personnel selection, of the

08:47.105 --> 08:54.097
five we looked at, he wasn't my top choice of the 
five. But I'm sure, in retrospect, that we could

08:54.618 --> 08:57.783
have done it better. He would be now. There's no 
question about it. You feel that, perhaps, he was

09:00.367 --> 09:05.055
just the right person at the right time in the right 
place. Yes. And I think it's worked out

09:05.997 --> 09:07.780
beautifully. And because the college has grown so 
much, I guess he has a hard time himself, just like

09:08.367 --> 09:16.596
you said, between departments and keeping a close 
contact. But I guess he does it for you all as

09:17.057 --> 09:21.722
department heads to transmit this feeling. He 
does. And I guess in some ways, I would say, I think

09:22.523 --> 09:38.121
Oregon is looking as an administrator rather than 
as a leader. Probably some of them are sloppy

09:38.692 --> 09:40.555
administrators. He's not a very tidy 
administrator. Uh, leaves a lot of loose ends, but

09:44.541 --> 09:48.406
that, maybe that's good. Maybe that's good. 
That's his style. Yeah, that's his style, and I

09:50.309 --> 10:01.486
think that that's brought in, enabled some of the 
graffiti to get back in that we, that we've been

09:50.309 --> 10:01.486
lacking. A certain amount of that is needed in the 
institution of higher education. So the College

10:06.029 --> 10:18.408
of Education, you feel, is alive and well, and in 
spite of all of the things that we're facing, which

10:06.029 --> 10:18.408
a lot of the changes that are coming about through 
the legislature and all will not have an adverse

10:06.029 --> 10:18.408
effect, if anything? Well, they may have an 
adverse effect, but it's not going to slow it down.

10:23.035 --> 10:28.143
It's going to have to be some major internal change 
in ways in order for it to be set back down.

10:31.428 --> 10:34.433
External factors are not going to turn it around 
now. Dr. Owens, I really appreciate you sharing

10:36.235 --> 10:42.312
all of these perceptions of the past and the 
present and the future. And certainly you have

10:42.633 --> 10:51.156
contributed a great deal to the growth, 
especially of the administration department And

10:51.490 --> 11:02.473
I think the fact that the service is so prevalent in 
the department that you chair is a source of

10:51.490 --> 11:02.473
satisfaction because that's what education is, 
is going after and serving. So I appreciate it, and

11:02.493 --> 11:05.460
I will visit with you further. Okay, great.
