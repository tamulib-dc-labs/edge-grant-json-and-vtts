00:02.765 --> 00:12.517
And the beef because the Indians were so prevalent 
that they'd steal anything that they could get.

00:12.537 --> 00:19.004
The logs up there is where they would put their 
bedrollers over the day and take them down at

00:12.537 --> 00:19.004
night. That's where they would be put in here. 
Grandmother did her work of quilting out here, and

00:23.229 --> 00:31.219
it was cool. He would go in to Austin to get the 
commodities, and this is more or less of a trading

00:31.587 --> 00:39.176
post. He would have bring back wagon loads of 
things and supply what he had around

00:39.196 --> 00:51.852
here. Well, over here, you can see that where 
that's lined up out there, that ridge, In 1920, my

01:00.848 --> 01:11.801
husband and I bought 30 acres of the original Louis 
Johnson home place, and that is it. And it came to

01:11.821 --> 01:15.906
right where that smokehouse is, right down here. 
The rest of it, from here to town, and from here to

01:15.926 --> 01:20.532
the highway, was ours. And just this house, from 
here to the Bruckner's at that time. We sold that to

01:28.777 --> 01:37.011
President Johnson and moved our cows from there. 
But it is quite something else. My grandmother was

01:39.856 --> 01:47.810
brought here as a bride, and I was brought over 
there as a bride. So that's how my roots are built. a

01:52.098 --> 01:58.045
little bit deeper than the average

01:52.098 --> 01:58.045
person. And I love it. And I love the people. I guess 
that's why I'm here. Do they even go back? I don't

02:06.093 --> 02:06.794
know. How about that time that the Indians nearly 
got to your grandmother? Well, she had gone down to

02:11.639 --> 02:17.085
the... Well, we dug that hole out down there. You 
all saw that big pool of water. And when we dug it

02:19.869 --> 02:21.210
out, We found lots of cattle and horse bones and 
things. That was an open spring that bubbled up. So

02:29.231 --> 02:33.137
we dug it out and irrigated all of that land down 
there. But when grandmother lived here, she went

02:33.538 --> 02:44.094
down there together, some poke greens for dinner, 
and bring some fresh water back to the house. She

02:44.114 --> 02:48.160
looked out across the flat over there, or the 
senderos it's called, up there and she saw these

02:48.477 --> 02:59.490
Comanche Indians coming and she knew that if they 
got up here that they would kill her babies. She had

02:59.510 --> 03:01.853
two of them. One was a tiny baby in the cradle in 
there and the other was about 18 months old.

03:10.415 --> 03:15.402
running around and she had left them here at the 
house while she went down. They were asleep while

03:15.422 --> 03:18.647
she went down to get the water. So she left her water 
and she come running back up here and she pulled her

03:18.667 --> 03:29.343
rug back from in front of the hearse and 
Grandfather had a root cellar down under there.

03:29.403 --> 03:34.831
They kept a lot of their things hid from the 
enemies. So she grabbed a diaper and put around the

03:38.073 --> 03:48.263
tiny baby and took the other little one and they 
crawled down in under this, in this root cellar and

03:38.073 --> 03:48.263
pulled the lid over it. And the Indians came 
through and they stole everything that

03:49.064 --> 04:03.478
Grandfather had gone to Austin to get to go up the 
trail the next day, next two days rather. He was to

04:03.559 --> 04:08.063
leave the second day after the raid. She went to the 
barn and he saw that they had killed the bee and they

04:08.954 --> 04:16.427
had taken her saddle and they had taken her horse. 
And he came back to the house and he called Eliza and

04:17.028 --> 04:21.856
Eliza didn't answer. He called Eliza and she still 
didn't answer. And he went through the house and he

04:24.280 --> 04:29.188
thought we didn't have any commodities left, 
nothing left. They had cleaned him out. And he

04:31.060 --> 04:35.186
said, well, I guess they've just taken her and 
taken the babies. And he looked in the cradle, and

04:35.306 --> 04:38.370
there was nothing in the cradle. And he had his 
boots on, and he stomped his foot, and he said,

04:39.031 --> 04:47.263
Eliza Jane Button, if you're here, you answer me. 
She said, yes, Sammy Lee, I'm here. He said, well,

04:53.131 --> 04:55.634
why didn't you answer me before? She said, Sammy 
Lee? Don't you know that an Indian can mimic

04:58.820 --> 05:04.528
anything and everything that ever walked? And how 
did they? They didn't know that my name was Eliza

05:06.110 --> 05:10.637
Jane Button, and nobody but you did. And that's the 
reason I answered you. So that's when she came out.

05:20.150 --> 05:25.958
She said to me, she said, now, Sammy Lee, I have 
these two little girls. And I'm not going to raise

05:26.410 --> 05:28.598
them in the wilderness. You can just take me back to 
the prairie and you can take these cattle on that

05:28.618 --> 05:38.513
Chisholm Trail and say, let me live in peace. While 
you're gone, I'm not going to stay up here. So she

05:41.553 --> 05:43.756
went back to the prairie. She was a little woman, 
but I want you to know she covered the ground she

05:43.836 --> 05:50.202
stood on. And when she told you that that was enough 
when you were little, she didn't repeat it the

05:50.323 --> 05:58.091
second time. You knew better. Okay? Oh.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.916
I have found something I thought was right good.

06:22.540 --> 06:27.005
But she's hard but true. I

06:27.025 --> 06:44.123
didn't put down my camera, and I intended to do 
that.

06:52.017 --> 06:56.161
I forgot my county. Anyway, what

06:56.181 --> 07:15.280
county is it in Texas that's larger than the state 
of Rhode Island and doesn't have a single

06:56.181 --> 07:15.280
commercial business in it? I have forgotten and I 
had that put down. Brewster. Brewster County. All

07:21.687 --> 07:22.007
right. Only 900 people live there. They have their 
own church, their own school, their own post

07:26.770 --> 07:32.187
office, and their own commissary. It's larger 
than the King Ranch. And it's the only county in

07:37.478 --> 07:43.246
Texas that doesn't have a single gasoline 
station. Well, that's it. I was thinking of

07:45.769 --> 07:47.892
gasoline stations then. So unusual for this day 
and time. That's the reason why I put it down here.

07:52.659 --> 08:01.151
Now, one thing about living here, and I know Miss A 
was talking about this before, but this really was

07:52.659 --> 08:01.151
isolated. We'd gotten here pretty easily and the 
roads were good and everything, but it was a

08:01.171 --> 08:06.338
different story. in the 1910s and 1920s, Linden 
worked on the first road that they built into this

08:06.622 --> 08:12.952
area. I don't think that Linden was the only one who 
worked on it, brother. I did too. We had a wagon.

08:19.041 --> 08:23.528
That was before child labor law came into effect. 
My daddy had a wagon in Keene, and we had

08:24.489 --> 08:33.743
in this old wagon, the bottom of it, and they had 
them tapered so we could turn them like that and

08:34.381 --> 08:40.589
empty the sand out. And we hauled sand from the 
river down there to the first six miles on this road

08:40.609 --> 08:49.199
from Johnson City to Miller Creek right out there. 
And there was three of us, my sister and Lyndon and

08:49.660 --> 08:53.705
I. And I was the oldest.

08:58.190 --> 09:03.156
Listen, it's no fun to be the oldest of women. I'll 
tell you that. Because he was the largest, and he

09:05.767 --> 09:08.870
thought he was boss. And my dad used to say, now you 
do this, sister. You do this, and you keep him in

09:12.574 --> 09:14.577
line. Keep him in line, me, I. And I got more 
spankings for it than anything else. But anyway,

09:21.304 --> 09:25.269
we hauled gravel for that. And then Uncle Sam, 
actually, we got it. Actually, it was tops. They

09:29.974 --> 09:33.278
had a lot of loose rock and things along the side. 
And they gave London a rake and told him to rake

09:33.595 --> 09:43.374
those rocks off down in the bar ditch so they could 
come along with the Fresno and pick them all off.

09:44.597 --> 09:50.969
Well, he worked a couple days and decided that he 
could go back to school and do anything to do that.

09:50.989 --> 09:52.071
That's the truth. That's the real. Anything else 
you want to know besides what I haven't

09:55.398 --> 10:04.051
told you? Oh,

10:04.171 --> 10:16.390
you know if you want to call somebody a bad name and 
you want to really, really get to them, just call

10:04.171 --> 10:16.390
them a turkey. That's all you have to do, just call 
them a turkey. There's a picture down there in the

10:19.574 --> 10:24.662
exhibit center. where they bought turkeys. And 
they were bought, and we'd drive those plastic

10:28.139 --> 10:35.346
things, and that's a good name for them, from here 
to Marble Falls. And every time a grace offered to

10:36.267 --> 10:41.772
fly over the road, what do you think happened? Yes, 
they scattered from here to breakfast. And then

10:45.295 --> 10:52.202
you'd have to go and round them up again and get them 
started out. And you couldn't drive them in a day's

10:52.520 --> 10:55.204
time. You couldn't drive them in two days' time. 
And let me tell you something. A turkey won't roost

11:01.332 --> 11:04.597
in an ordinary tree. It's got to be the highest tree 
that they can find. And

11:07.281 --> 11:17.295
you've got to just work them around and around and 
around that tree to ever get them to roost. Oh, it

11:19.739 --> 11:22.743
And if you want to get even with anybody, don't call 
them chicken. That's a good name. Call them a

11:24.786 --> 11:26.288
turkey. How long did it take y'all to do that? Two 
days and nights. It

11:31.275 --> 11:43.452
will measure about 23 miles.

11:44.512 --> 11:46.754
No, sir, that's not moving. You can go four miles an 
hour with a turkey if you'll make him go. Four miles

11:52.940 --> 12:01.028
is a pretty good speed for a turkey, but you don't 
make

11:52.940 --> 12:01.028
him do it. Miss Cox, you were driving cattle to town 
when you had the turtle suits, weren't you? Yes, I

12:06.713 --> 12:07.754
was. She didn't want to tell about the turtle 
suits. My daddy made, now this is a long time ago,

12:13.402 --> 12:24.424
they farmed kids out just like they go down to the 
border and get some wetbacks to come in and work.

12:24.444 --> 12:28.893
Well, in this country, they'd farm the kids out 
like mine. And so they'd farm those, well... They

12:33.483 --> 12:37.429
said, get those Johnson kids. Go ahead and tell 
them. Get that bunch of Johnson kids. They're

12:40.513 --> 12:42.536
tougher than a boot. We'll get by with them. So 
that's the name we had. So no use to deny those

12:47.423 --> 12:50.146
things. You'd like to be good, but there wasn't any 
good things. And we didn't rob a bank, though, boys

12:54.132 --> 12:59.299
and girls. And we didn't get put in jail. We got led 
up to it. We just didn't get any. You got as close as

13:07.585 --> 13:09.468
you could get. Just as close as we could get. That's 
for seeding chickens and drying them on the river.

13:13.673 --> 13:16.637
I didn't hear that. It's the first time I've heard 
it. You're telling me more than I want to know.

13:23.186 --> 13:26.650
Well, a senior class, it was six of us anyway. And 
the six of us, there's three Chomsons. So... And

13:30.335 --> 13:38.766
one of them, one, wasn't it, Johnson, was Ross, and 
she was the first cousin of Margaret and I, so we was

13:30.335 --> 13:38.766
all kinfolks. I had made four of us, and the other 
two had to follow suit every time. Poor things,

13:42.812 --> 13:45.536
they didn't have a chance. They didn't have a 
chance. They didn't have a chance. They just had to

13:47.438 --> 13:49.581
follow along with us, so they did. And we went out 
here, and we had plenty of chickens at home, but,

13:50.322 --> 13:59.835
you know, it's just fun to see if we can get it out of 
somebody else's. And to keep them from hollering,

14:00.220 --> 14:05.726
we had to wring their necks. So we'd kill them as 
soon as we caught them. And we had four. And there

14:11.433 --> 14:13.315
was only six of us in the class. Now, we had four 
chickens to eat. But we went down there, and every

14:15.398 --> 14:18.942
one of us was designated. Now, you go get the flour. 
You slip the flour out. You get the salt and pepper.

14:24.028 --> 14:24.989
You get the grease. You get the pan. And anybody 
that failed to bring it, boy, They got sent back

14:29.262 --> 14:32.546
actually, and they were glad to get him. But 
anyway, that's how that worked. And I want you to

14:34.388 --> 14:40.736
know we finally took him up a storm, and we heard 
this car coming. And you know, cars in those days

14:40.756 --> 14:45.341
would scare us to death. But we heard it coming, and 
we didn't want the world. We knew there was

14:49.907 --> 14:51.789
something. Well, this was the district attorney. 
Yeah, and he came up. And he came down there and he

14:57.528 --> 15:00.632
asked us where we got those chickens. Lemon was the 
spokesman. He said, well, uh... He looked at me and

15:11.427 --> 15:14.591
started saying, we got him today. And Kitty said, 
no, we didn't have him in the cook. We didn't have

15:17.675 --> 15:20.199
him. So Kitty and I said, that was my cousin. She... 
yeah we got him over at mr ross's and he said good

15:25.102 --> 15:47.194
night uncle and he came out of that course and my 
chickens were all in the pen well all right he's

15:25.102 --> 15:47.194
already sunk so we told him where we got him and he 
gave us a lecture and he told us that well he'd have

15:25.102 --> 15:47.194
us before the grand jury the next day We'd have to, 
man, what a disgrace we'd draw on our families, but

15:47.393 --> 15:55.904
the zillion chickens and these just ruined the 
reputation of the school. All of us seniors, and

15:56.605 --> 16:03.034
we'd just ruin the reputation of the Johnson City 
High School seniors by doing anything like that.

16:04.656 --> 16:08.501
Well, we spared the living car out of it. And sure 
enough, that's before the grand jury. And we told

16:11.485 --> 16:14.149
them we didn't. And we were assessed penalty. 
paying for them. And we did. Of course, it wasn't

16:23.901 --> 16:25.303
too much. But, you know, in those days, a dollar a 
hen was a whole lot of money. And it was a whole lot of

16:31.873 --> 16:33.956
money for us to get. And what we did, well, shoot. We 
did. I washed dishes all day in the cafe for a

16:40.526 --> 16:43.911
quarter. trying to save that old man. Did you even 
get to finish eating the chicken? No, we didn't get

16:50.027 --> 16:51.750
any of it. They took it all and just left us. And I 
mean, we just spewed and sputtered in our own fat.

16:58.839 --> 17:00.101
Scared to death. Now, there was one time I said we 
was right at the jailhouse doors. I'd rather have

17:04.046 --> 17:07.971
been put in jail and listened to that call. And it 
happened. Tell them about the turtle soup. Well,

17:11.471 --> 17:23.523
my daddy had sold these steers to Tom

17:11.471 --> 17:23.523
Stripling, who was a big cattle buyer in this 
country back in 1915 to 1925. He bought lots of

17:24.124 --> 17:28.168
turtle soup here. And so we lived down the river 
there, 10 miles, and he sold it round mountain this

17:28.929 --> 17:35.616
way about Well, it's exactly 15 miles to his pens, 
and so that's 25 miles. So you drive an old cow just

17:43.111 --> 18:00.146
about five, six miles, not over that, an hour, if 
they drive good, and if you've got the lane and you

17:43.111 --> 18:00.146
don't have seat brakes, and you don't have 
something to scare them with, you get along pretty

17:43.111 --> 18:00.146
good, and if you don't, you do. So we got over there 
just about... She told us she had a great long

18:03.659 --> 18:06.823
fortune. She told us, you can take your horse down 
to the barn. You can put it in there. And put your

18:15.152 --> 18:22.820
saddle and your blanket over here so you can use 
that to sleep on it. Look at Marty. Look at him. I

18:25.664 --> 18:29.868
thought he was sleeping on an old stinky, wet 
saddle blanket. Didn't say anything. So we put our

18:33.562 --> 18:49.939
blanket and our saddle down and went on down and put 
the horse in the barn and Teddy came on back up to the

18:33.562 --> 18:49.939
house and still just worrying me to death about 
having to sleep on that stinking saddle blanket.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.823
Had an old stinky. sweaty saddle blanket and got to 
sleep on it. You know what I'm talking about. You

18:57.095 --> 19:00.299
missed part of your life. It really is a loader. So 
she called us in and said, I got just something to

19:02.281 --> 19:09.531
eat. She said, don't wash your hands. I didn't see 
any place to wash hands. But I said, where, Mrs.

19:15.277 --> 19:17.700
Scribby? And she said, oh, there's a tin tub right 
out there in the back closet. She said, just go out

19:21.946 --> 19:24.770
there and wash it. OK, we went out there and washed 
our hands in the tin tub. Come back, went in the

19:27.794 --> 19:34.022
house and sat down and gave us a big bowl. And in 
front of it was just as clear as crystal. It looked

19:39.890 --> 19:40.330
like that. But then I said, what is this news? She 
says, that's soup. He says, soup? And he looked

19:49.560 --> 19:53.725
down again and he said, well, just what kind of soup 
is this? She said, well, Tuttle soup of course.

19:57.048 --> 19:59.111
It's good for you. Margaret pushed it back. I 
pushed mine back. She said, well, what in the world

20:03.175 --> 20:06.099
is wrong with you gal? Are you too high-toned to eat 
Tuttle? Margaret said, I sure am. I just can't do

20:10.864 --> 20:13.927
this. And so... Tom came along and

20:14.980 --> 20:20.926
he gave us each one a nickel. And it was a mile and a 
half over to the country store. And we

20:28.893 --> 20:44.228
walked over there and got a A can of five cents of 
sardines. Oh, God. And a package. Lyndon brought

20:52.316 --> 20:54.699
the crackers. And Marguerite and I bought two cans 
of sardines, and that was our supper. Oh, God. Oh,

21:00.887 --> 21:01.508
God. That's just what I thought. And hungry. I was 
hungry to my heels. That's what we had. That's a

21:08.217 --> 21:09.278
total soup. That total soup didn't go down. Sure it 
didn't. Y'all have any questions you want to ask

21:14.752 --> 21:17.495
me? All right, this is something that is off the 
records, but we talked about this in 1936 from the

21:17.515 --> 21:28.446
headless Centennial Parade in San Antonio. My 
father was president of the old trail drivers and I

21:28.466 --> 21:35.092
rode in that parade. This year, when the wagon 
train came through, I got on down here at San

21:35.112 --> 21:44.742
Antonio, rode up the air and from here to Kerber. So 
I don't know that I'll make the next 50 years that I

21:45.110 --> 21:52.097
made this. I'd bet money on it. I wouldn't be there 
trying. But anyway, that's something that you

21:56.221 --> 21:58.664
won't find. Not too many people can make that 
claim. No, that's what I say. Not too many can do

22:03.248 --> 22:04.589
that. I just wonder how many that were part of that 
Centennial train did make it to the . I don't know. I

22:10.776 --> 22:12.197
had no idea. I was working down at the ranch, down at 
Cypress Mill, and I mean working, I mean all of it.

22:20.695 --> 22:24.364
She still keeps the ranch going now. I have 
double-registered burners, and I'm proud of

22:24.384 --> 22:28.875
them. They're pretty. And I went down, I was 
working, I was working down there yesterday

22:29.828 --> 22:36.658
afternoon, but anyway, come back in that before 
it's going to pity. The telephone rang and said,

22:36.678 --> 22:43.587
Ms. Cox, what do you have lined up for this next 
week? I said, well, nothing, only just ordinary

22:43.607 --> 22:50.897
chores that a person with a place has to take care 
of. Why? Well, would you, do you think you'd be

22:51.698 --> 22:57.827
able, are you physically fit to ride a wagon? I 
said, what? So I asked over, do you think you're

23:01.568 --> 23:06.783
physically fit to ride a wagon? I said, well, I'm 
going to tell you something. I've ridden in wagons

23:09.531 --> 23:13.943
a lot of times. And they're a lot easier riding than 
some of these Ford's that I've been in. So she said,

23:18.903 --> 23:26.754
well, what I called for, I want to know if you'd ride 
in a 16-year-old wagon train. I said, well, I don't

23:27.395 --> 23:29.998
mind that. You just want me to ride, and I don't have 
to do anything? Not a thing. Well, that was a bunch

23:36.267 --> 23:39.291
of baloney I got to do plenty of. But anyway, I 
enjoyed every bit of it, and it was worth it. Of

23:45.074 --> 23:50.900
course, they didn't think I could cook, but I can 
fool you. I can make good, good sourdough biscuits

23:50.940 --> 23:56.746
in an old skillet. That was something. No turtle 
soup. Is there anything else? Oh, I don't know

24:06.216 --> 24:13.123
whether you, I know that you don't know this. The 
jail down here that we have,

24:14.369 --> 24:26.618
in the 17 surrounding counties, it's the only one 
that passed inspection by the state. And it was

24:27.299 --> 24:31.990
built by a man by the name of

24:35.210 --> 24:36.932
Kergy La Pookas Buildout. Isn't that a name for 
you? But anyway, he built that and it was all out of

24:40.615 --> 24:48.663
native rock like we have here and native rock that 
came from right over there. And it was done by, and

24:49.204 --> 24:58.653
it was specified in the order that was sent out that 
it all be done by native labor. And it was done by

24:58.673 --> 25:00.475
native labor. And he also built the vault in the 
courthouse that's down there now, and locked it,

25:00.978 --> 25:10.771
and built the lock for it. And he locked it. And they 
gave us a value for it this last, well, I started

25:14.496 --> 25:23.008
working on it in last May. Finally got it through 
last month. Yeah, you know, in addition to, since

25:26.873 --> 25:30.698
she doesn't have anything else to do, she's 
involved. with the Blanco County Historical

25:30.982 --> 25:34.007
Society. Just a little thing. How many clubs did 
you tell me who were coming back last spring? Five?

25:39.978 --> 25:43.003
Yeah, just about five. Garden Club, Woman's Club. 
You and I, your daughters, I'm proud of that. I

25:49.996 --> 25:52.541
think that's worth a whole lot of time now. Not 
everything that was left. You don't have any

25:55.568 --> 25:58.232
questions you want to ask them? This is your 
chance. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, exactly. You

26:03.220 --> 26:13.376
know, you mentioned that you're, Dave mentioned 
that you're teaching a course, Lyndon went into

26:03.220 --> 26:13.376
education also. I'm just wondering, what was the 
main influence for you going into that? Well, I'll

26:18.003 --> 26:20.547
tell you, it's a sad story. When you're born into a 
family of nothing but teachers, there's not much

26:21.067 --> 26:26.915
salvation for you. You just have to go ahead and do 
it. That's it. Now, my grandmother Johnson's

26:31.762 --> 26:47.503
family, they were music teachers, art teachers, 
and, of course, they call it home economics, but

26:31.762 --> 26:47.503
she was a seamstress. She taught sewing, 
principles. And then regular teachers there.

26:55.308 --> 27:06.942
Then, on my mother's side, the same six and a half, 
there wasn't any way that we could get out of it.

27:06.962 --> 27:10.167
It's just that or else. And if you've ever been that 
else road once with them, you don't want to repeat.

27:16.415 --> 27:17.356
You just go ahead. I forgot how you said when you 
married your husband. How old were you? Well, I

27:24.841 --> 27:28.526
wasn't old enough. I knew you were young, but I 
can't remember how old you were. Well, my mother

27:31.390 --> 27:37.219
said I wasn't right behind the ears. Well, I don't 
think any. 17-year-old girl really knows what she

27:40.177 --> 27:44.685
wants to do to get out of work. That's the only thing 
I can tell you she wants to do. Are you married to get

27:46.849 --> 27:47.931
out of work? Yeah, but they don't know what they're 
getting into. They're probably getting more work

27:51.016 --> 27:52.900
than they do. They absolutely do. They absolutely 
do. But, well, you can't tell them anything if you

27:56.767 --> 28:02.016
swallow them both. Now this, this is rippling, but 
it's the truth before my girls got on it. We went to

28:11.338 --> 28:13.821
church that morning. Well, my husband had asked me 
once to watch the door, and I get to show you how

28:13.841 --> 28:20.532
little sense you go ahead. And I feel like now I have 
a little bit of common sense, but I won't say too

28:20.552 --> 28:25.159
much. But anyway... Went to church that morning. I 
go to church whether I do any good or not, I go. So

28:33.773 --> 28:40.282
when we went in, he said to me, he said, how about us 
getting married today? I said, what did you say? He

28:43.667 --> 28:48.073
said, how about us getting married today? I just 
turned around and I said, well, brother, what do

28:48.093 --> 28:50.557
you know? Get the license, let's go. no more give it 
a thought than nothing under the shining sun, so

28:54.832 --> 29:01.922
help me glory. And I didn't think anything about 
it. No, I really didn't. And he just turned around

29:05.848 --> 29:08.732
and left me standing there at the door. And when it 
was time to go in, I went on in and sat down. And they

29:13.700 --> 29:18.306
sang Onward Christian Soldiers. And Owen wasn't 
there. I thought, oh, heavens. He'd gone

29:22.253 --> 29:23.734
somewhere else. I don't know where, but he went 
there. And so then

29:26.017 --> 29:41.372
the next song they sang, they usually sang three, 
and then every class went to their room for

29:26.017 --> 29:41.372
service. And they sang, The Half Has Never Yet Been 
Told. And I thought to myself, that's a song.

29:51.734 --> 29:54.777
Wonder what our lessons are. Well, about that time 
old one walked up. He didn't stop by where I sit. He

30:03.507 --> 30:05.709
never even looked at me. His head would be lying up 
to where that creature's sitting down. And he said

30:09.433 --> 30:16.020
to him, he said, Brother Morgan, I have the license 
here, and I think that Ava and I'd like to get

30:16.726 --> 30:19.490
married this month. He said, well, you'll just do 
it right now. Oh, yeah. And that's exactly what

30:26.039 --> 30:28.743
happened down that aisle. He came, he picked me up, 
he said, are you ready? I said, with what? He said,

30:31.968 --> 30:34.051
we're going to get married. I said, well, I told 
you, I read his viewer. I didn't have one or two

30:38.437 --> 30:40.220
things. I didn't even have a purse. I didn't have 
one thing. Oh. And just as he said, I pronounce you

30:43.928 --> 30:52.445
Mary Michael, and then Margaret walked in that 
door of the church. And he said, oh, no, you can't do

30:53.187 --> 30:55.672
that, Ava. You can't.
