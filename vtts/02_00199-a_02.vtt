WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:06.251
You know, he loved to go to the Border Olympics.

00:07.412 --> 00:13.178
Did he ever get loud or was he always soft-spoken?

00:13.198 --> 00:14.540
He was always soft-spoken.

00:16.502 --> 00:23.008
Of course, I wasn't around him coaching much, but when I was, I mean, he never screamed at anybody or anything.

00:23.088 --> 00:27.393
I mean, and he would go, here's something else he would do.

00:27.473 --> 00:29.155
He was a great pole vault coach.

00:29.175 --> 00:29.515
All right.

00:30.997 --> 00:36.203
He would go, he would grab the pole, and some guy would stand there, run down a runway.

00:36.283 --> 00:37.905
Well, he'd run up there and grab the pole.

00:37.965 --> 00:38.967
He'd say, back up, back up.

00:39.227 --> 00:40.228
He said, here's how you do that.

00:40.368 --> 00:41.189
He'd lay down.

00:41.630 --> 00:48.017
He'd lay down on the runway and go through the motions, you know, how you hold your pole there, laying down there.

00:48.037 --> 00:51.942
I mean, the pole walker, I mean, just shocked, standing there looking at Colonel Innes.

00:52.124 --> 00:58.131
lay down and run down, and he'd say, I'm putting it in a box, and I'm vaulting it, went through the motion.

00:58.772 --> 01:01.756
And he did the same thing with the discus and the shot like that.

01:01.836 --> 01:05.120
So I learned a lot real fast from him.

01:05.140 --> 01:10.387
Did he have any no-no's that he told his track team members?

01:13.370 --> 01:16.234
Well, it was standard in those days.

01:16.254 --> 01:17.135
You didn't smoke.

01:17.295 --> 01:19.458
I mean, didn't smoke and didn't drink.

01:20.219 --> 01:21.220
What about what they ate?

01:22.280 --> 01:24.062
or their exercise routine?

01:24.243 --> 01:24.863
Did he have any?

01:24.883 --> 01:29.369
Well, I don't know for sure, but I had a routine.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.573
I put my routine on it.

01:32.593 --> 01:32.793
All right.

01:33.054 --> 01:33.394
Let's see.

01:33.434 --> 01:34.936
Now, let's back up on one thing.

01:35.617 --> 01:38.981
Move you and your wife and your daughter to College Station.

01:39.062 --> 01:41.665
What did you all bring down here, and where did you find a place to live?

01:42.085 --> 01:51.898
We moved over on Dunn Street, and that was over, well, between here and

01:52.385 --> 01:55.009
Between here and downtown Bryan.

01:56.070 --> 02:04.683
All right, after two or three years, well, Bobby Rogers and all of them lived over in another neighborhood.

02:05.384 --> 02:09.210
After three years, we bought a house and moved.

02:09.851 --> 02:14.297
All right, we moved on Coach, on what they call Coach's Alley.

02:15.539 --> 02:17.582
Tom Chandler lived on the corner.

02:18.288 --> 02:26.400
And I lived on the corner, and right up the street, the assistant football coach used to be the dean.

02:27.001 --> 02:37.355
After he got through coaching, he was in the registrar's office, assistant registrar.

02:38.076 --> 02:38.597
You know him.

02:39.238 --> 02:40.520
He's around all the time.

02:41.682 --> 02:43.384
Anyway, he was coaching.

02:45.607 --> 02:46.168
Zappalack.

02:46.452 --> 02:47.993
Oh, Willie's Appalach.

02:48.033 --> 02:49.074
No, no, Willie's Appalach.

02:49.094 --> 02:51.336
We were right around the bend.

02:52.537 --> 02:54.439
Worked in what dean's office?

02:54.459 --> 02:55.580
In the registrar's office.

02:56.621 --> 03:02.385
He was assistant registrar for a while.

03:03.907 --> 03:06.169
You didn't know him.

03:06.909 --> 03:11.053
He was a halfback coach, assistant coach under Stallings all over the years.

03:11.073 --> 03:16.037
When you all moved down here, did A&M pay for any of your expenses?

03:16.057 --> 03:16.257
No, uh-uh.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.146
So you moved it yourself?

03:18.387 --> 03:18.587
Yeah.

03:19.728 --> 03:23.651
I got my daddy's old beat-up pickup truck.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.872
He come up and helped us move.

03:26.134 --> 03:29.517
And do you remember what that first house cost on Dunn?

03:30.698 --> 03:31.979
That's the one I'm living in right now.

03:32.599 --> 03:35.442
Oh, on Dunn Street was a rent house.

03:35.462 --> 03:40.006
We rented that house.

03:40.026 --> 03:40.887
Do you remember what the rent was?

03:40.907 --> 03:46.412
I don't remember, but it's like $75 a month or something.

03:46.932 --> 03:48.554
So the year you got here is 50?

03:48.654 --> 03:50.756
That was 57.

03:50.796 --> 03:51.096
57.

03:51.817 --> 03:52.557
Uh-huh, 1957.

03:52.998 --> 03:55.100
And you moved to the new house in 50?

03:56.061 --> 03:56.361
About 1960.

03:56.401 --> 03:57.242
60.

03:57.642 --> 03:59.825
And you've been living there ever since?

03:59.925 --> 04:00.305
Ever since, uh-huh.

04:00.705 --> 04:03.168
And that house cost me $17,500.

04:03.868 --> 04:11.736
And it's not a rich house, but right now it's saved about $85,000 or $90,000.

04:13.218 --> 04:14.779
It's a nice little place.

04:14.894 --> 04:20.162
How easy was it to get acquainted when you got here?

04:20.322 --> 04:21.464
Oh, it was easy.

04:21.484 --> 04:23.387
It was great.

04:24.348 --> 04:29.315
Jim Myers took, we had parties, coaches, we called them coaches parties.

04:29.956 --> 04:42.555
Like after a basketball game, Coach Rogers and then later on Metcalfe and everybody, there for years they were,

04:43.075 --> 04:45.979
Everybody would come to the after basketball game.

04:45.999 --> 04:46.800
We'd go over to the house.

04:46.820 --> 04:50.745
You'd have Houston Chronicle, Dallas News, all those sports writers would be there.

04:51.706 --> 04:53.769
And we'd all go in there and talk, you know.

04:53.849 --> 04:56.913
And mainly the coaches and their wives and families.

04:57.013 --> 04:58.675
And we did that for a long time.

04:59.115 --> 05:02.820
And then Jim Meyer took everybody on the deep sea fishing thing.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.282
Aggie owned the thing.

05:04.302 --> 05:09.028
And we went to dinner at Galveston, pretty close to Galveston.

05:09.048 --> 05:12.272
Anyway, we spent the night on the boat.

05:12.961 --> 05:21.835
I mean, and then about 3 o'clock in the morning, the boat took off, went way out there about 65 miles, and we all got seasick and everything.

05:21.855 --> 05:25.080
But anyway, we were a close-knit group.

05:25.100 --> 05:29.867
Who became your close, in those early years, who were your closest friends, you and your wife?

05:30.989 --> 05:33.673
It was the other coaches.

05:33.693 --> 05:36.077
But there must have been some favorites of the coaches.

05:36.117 --> 05:37.799
Which ones were y'all?

05:37.819 --> 05:40.183
Well, it got to be Shelby.

05:40.957 --> 05:47.148
and Ted Nelson, of course I hired Ted Nelson and Tom Chandler.

05:47.168 --> 05:48.590
We were real close all the time.

05:50.474 --> 05:54.902
Describe that first year, what track team talent did you inherit?

05:56.024 --> 06:00.231
Well, I had a good

06:00.599 --> 06:07.654
quarter miler and the quarter miler was named Cash and he was from New York and his daddy was a big Aggie.

06:08.596 --> 06:18.777
And then I had a Latin American, a Spanish type guy about 6'3 and he was the best hurler we had.

06:19.735 --> 06:22.238
Uribe, named Uribe.

06:23.740 --> 06:27.985
But the best one we had was the shot putter and discus throwers.

06:28.005 --> 06:30.048
In fact, I carried them to the NCA.

06:30.108 --> 06:30.768
They were good enough.

06:30.788 --> 06:32.430
They won the Southwest Conference.

06:35.054 --> 06:39.259
Oh, Olin Hill.

06:40.340 --> 06:41.521
Olin Hill.

06:41.582 --> 06:43.003
Well, he was a discus champion.

06:43.304 --> 06:43.664
All right.

06:44.265 --> 06:49.371
About 10 years later, I get a phone call, Olin Hill.

06:50.802 --> 06:53.809
Charlie, we got a great sprinter up here.

06:53.869 --> 06:55.292
His name is Floyd Hurd.

06:55.953 --> 06:57.036
You remember Floyd Hurd?

06:57.897 --> 07:00.403
See, that's where the Aggies come in.

07:00.423 --> 07:06.516
10 years, or maybe 15 years after I coached him,

07:06.496 --> 07:09.139
He's a big businessman in Milwaukee.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.744
I mean, he's a big, he's a stockbroker and all that stuff.

07:14.866 --> 07:15.446
He calls me.

07:15.486 --> 07:16.528
I go up there to see him.

07:16.548 --> 07:19.871
We go over and see Floyd Heard, you know, take Floyd Heard out.

07:20.572 --> 07:23.055
He'd give Floyd Heard a job during the summer.

07:24.016 --> 07:26.759
And, you know, anyway, later on I signed Floyd Heard.

07:26.860 --> 07:30.083
He'd come down, and his name was on that world record list.

07:31.185 --> 07:34.208
But anyway, that's how the Aggies operate.

07:34.930 --> 07:38.766
Anyway, Owen Hill, he was a disc restorer.

07:39.107 --> 07:42.240
I had him at one year.

07:43.148 --> 07:48.133
All right, you didn't recruit any for that first fall, I mean that first year.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.915
It was too late, I presume.

07:50.496 --> 07:52.918
Describe beginning to recruit for A&M.

07:53.018 --> 07:53.879
How did you do it?

07:54.039 --> 07:58.864
Well, I started, I recruited the same way that kind of they recruited me.

08:00.006 --> 08:03.429
And I did pretty good.

08:03.449 --> 08:12.919
The first group that I recruited won the Southwest Conference in cross country the next year or two before Putman took over.

08:13.675 --> 08:21.526
I won two or three Southwest Conference champions, and E. L. Enter was one of them.

08:22.027 --> 08:27.054
You see him, he ended up being a scientist, a big scientist guy.

08:27.074 --> 08:31.601
The main thing about those early guys, they all did well after they graduated.

08:32.081 --> 08:34.986
I mean, they were more like real students, you know.

08:35.466 --> 08:43.598
Thad Crooks was one of them from up in East Texas, and he was a half-miler and everything.

08:44.793 --> 08:49.578
I signed them pretty good, because Danny Roberts came along real close.

08:49.598 --> 08:59.549
I forget whether it was the second or third year, but Danny Roberts was my first big shot-footer, and I got Darrell Hooper to help me recruit him.

09:00.670 --> 09:14.445
So I had Darrell Hooper, and then Danny Roberts, and then Randy Mattson, and then Randy Burns and Michael Stutes.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.093
3, 370 foot shot putters.

09:17.113 --> 09:20.056
I'm the only coach in the world that had 370 foot shot putters.

09:20.837 --> 09:33.851
When did, when you were recruiting, how and when did you decide whether you really wanted an athlete?

09:33.871 --> 09:37.395
Well, my way I, the way I recruited was

09:37.595 --> 09:39.459
get the best.

09:39.479 --> 09:48.236
I mean, you know, if you could fill up 16 scholarships with 16 great athletes, you could win the national every year.

09:48.537 --> 09:52.144
I mean, you know, nobody could do that, but that was my theory,

09:52.681 --> 10:08.849
Like if I was later on when 16, 15, 6 or 16 foot was good in the pole vault, I would get a fair of a pole vault for the full scholarship, like Randy Hall, and it was worth it because he ended up, I think, winning the NCAA.

10:09.470 --> 10:14.098
If they were good, just like the javelin coach here right now,

10:15.361 --> 10:33.580
Juan de la Gaza, I recruited him, gave him a full scholarship and he makes the Olympic team for Mexico in a javelin and he holds A&M school records like 280 foot in a javelin, but we had to give him a good one like that, you give him a full scholarship.

10:33.600 --> 10:41.588
And now, during the year, in those early years, when did you first go to visit with them?

10:41.872 --> 10:44.557
Did you wait until the spring or did you start it in the fall?

10:44.577 --> 10:46.701
No, we'd start as soon as school started.

10:46.781 --> 10:49.025
There wasn't any limit on visits.

10:49.726 --> 11:02.209
Just like one of the first Goodwin's that I signed was from Louisiana, and I started recruiting him when he was a junior, Ed Williams.

11:02.797 --> 11:07.823
Ed was a two-time state champion out of Louisiana, never lost a 100-yard dash in his life.

11:08.704 --> 11:12.368
And boy, we recruited him, LSU, and everybody recruited him.

11:12.468 --> 11:13.229
I flew him in.

11:14.831 --> 11:19.456
I had about 20 or 30 of the track team to go out to the airport to meet him.

11:20.017 --> 11:25.243
Ed Williams gets off the plane with a bottle of whiskey and wine in each hand.

11:27.383 --> 11:29.286
You know, what are you going to do?

11:29.306 --> 11:30.848
That's the world's best sprinter.

11:31.228 --> 11:37.217
I mean, he gets off the plane out at Easterwood Airport with whiskey in both hands.

11:37.677 --> 11:38.879
He comes to celebrate.

11:41.082 --> 11:42.444
Anyway, I end up finding the guy.

11:42.464 --> 11:43.365
But I go back and forth.

11:43.405 --> 11:44.086
I visit him.

11:44.827 --> 11:46.470
I'd go down there sometime.

11:46.930 --> 11:48.953
I'd leave here after practice.

11:50.047 --> 12:00.122
and run, you know, drive four or five hours, go in there and visit for an hour, 30 minutes, and get back in here by eight or nine o'clock the next morning, I mean.

12:01.183 --> 12:07.633
What did you try, when you were visiting with those athletes, what did you try to emphasize?

12:07.799 --> 12:09.983
get down and show them in a block.

12:10.003 --> 12:17.295
In fact, I've had several of them, like Broadhead, Doug Broadhead from Baton Rouge.

12:17.395 --> 12:20.440
I mean, I beat LSU and all the people on him.

12:20.500 --> 12:24.947
And later on, after I signed him, his daddy

12:24.927 --> 12:28.171
They'd go to all the track meets, their mother and daddy.

12:28.591 --> 12:34.478
And Broadhead, he was a quarter miler, but he won the Southwest Conference 221 years.

12:35.119 --> 12:40.826
And Mr. Broadhead said, Charlie, you know the main reason, we're just kind of talking.

12:41.306 --> 12:44.090
He said, you know the main reason how you got him?

12:44.791 --> 12:47.774
I said, no, I don't, because I've recruited him a long time.

12:47.794 --> 12:52.740
He said, when you got down there in the blocks in the house on your first visit,

12:52.720 --> 12:54.442
You even pulled off your shoes.

12:54.483 --> 12:55.644
I can't remember that.

12:55.684 --> 13:00.010
You even pulled off your shoes so you wouldn't mess up the wallpaper.

13:00.050 --> 13:04.116
You backed up and used the wall as your starting blocks.

13:04.156 --> 13:06.980
You showed him how to do this and how to do that.

13:08.122 --> 13:12.148
When he fired the gun, you walked out real slow using high arm action.

13:13.069 --> 13:14.291
He said that sold him.

13:15.833 --> 13:18.036
I'd do things like that.

13:18.556 --> 13:22.863
Do you remember anything that you did in those early years recruiting that didn't work?

13:24.826 --> 13:27.851
Yeah.

13:28.171 --> 13:32.358
An old saying was, I don't like the bent arm.

13:34.461 --> 13:35.363
I don't like the bent arm.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.546
I tried to get a guy to sign, I don't like the bent arm.

13:38.087 --> 13:39.349
At first, I didn't know what he taught.

13:39.369 --> 13:40.391
I said, what do you mean the bent arm?

13:40.651 --> 13:42.314
He said, I don't want to sloop.

13:42.334 --> 13:43.095
I don't want to sloop.

13:43.531 --> 13:50.763
See, in those days, everybody in the military, even a track guy had to wear a military uniform five days.

13:51.624 --> 13:52.786
You had to wear it all the time.

13:53.327 --> 14:05.927
Well, my first three or four years here, I went up to the headquarters and I got a permission deal that they didn't have to wear their uniform on Saturdays and Sundays.

14:06.970 --> 14:09.717
I got it fixed where I could get them out of practice.

14:10.178 --> 14:11.742
See, every Tuesday they had to drill.

14:11.802 --> 14:13.706
I mean, no track practice on Tuesday.

14:13.726 --> 14:16.754
They had to put on that uniform and go drill all day.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.064
Can you imagine not having track practice or ROTC had to drill?

14:21.826 --> 14:23.410
But anyway, I went up there and

14:23.947 --> 14:28.452
And I talked to the head man up there and I said, man, they're going to fire me if I don't win.

14:28.753 --> 14:29.854
They wasn't going to do that.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.218
He said, well, I'll tell you what you do.

14:34.159 --> 14:39.145
Every time you got a guy sick, he said, well, we send them out.

14:39.286 --> 14:41.789
And they had a square before they'd march around the square.

14:41.969 --> 14:43.531
I mean, two or three hours.

14:44.612 --> 14:47.636
Well, that was a punishment deal.

14:47.656 --> 14:48.777
I forget what they called it.

14:49.318 --> 14:52.722
But anyway, they let me sign a deal saying a guy was

14:53.039 --> 14:59.028
feeling bad, not sick, just feeling bad and he didn't have to put on the uniform and didn't have to go to the drill.

14:59.649 --> 15:10.305
So every Saturday I'd get my team off, but anyway this kid, Ed Williams, that I finally signed from Louisiana that I went back and forth a hundred times to get

15:11.770 --> 15:18.943
He was up in the dorm and he would throw balloons with him hard haul.

15:20.146 --> 15:22.811
Not hard, yeah, hard haul right there on the campus.

15:23.111 --> 15:28.902
He'd blow up his balloon with water and those military guys would walk across the street.

15:29.725 --> 15:40.118
the inner tube deal and put the water in it, they'd shoot way across there and shoot at those generals going back and forth from the military.

15:40.219 --> 15:42.241
I didn't know about all that, but I found out about it.

15:42.281 --> 15:49.691
But anyway, Ed Williamfield, Charlie, he said, every Saturday and Sunday, he said, you're going to have to come tie me up here.

15:50.231 --> 15:51.573
I said, what are you talking about?

15:51.874 --> 15:57.040
He said, I'm going home and I'm not ever coming back because I hate this uniform.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.243
I don't want to wear this damned old uniform.

15:59.594 --> 16:04.581
He said, if you don't come tie me up, tie me down, I'm going to go home and never come back.

16:04.621 --> 16:09.427
Well, boy, I mean, that first year or two, he'd go home sometime.

16:09.487 --> 16:11.670
I was afraid he wasn't going to come back.

16:11.690 --> 16:13.132
But he had problems.

16:13.152 --> 16:19.620
I mean, he was a good sprinter, but he got that mononucleosis.

16:19.640 --> 16:19.900
All right.

16:20.421 --> 16:24.927
We went to the conference meet one or two years, and I had seven.

16:25.160 --> 16:29.367
of my top track guys sick with mono.

16:30.489 --> 16:35.798
All right, I had, I count them up, I had about five, nine, five sprinters.

16:36.860 --> 16:39.143
I had some good, a bunch of good sprinters.

16:39.163 --> 16:40.225
We didn't even run the relay.

16:41.247 --> 16:47.337
They were all sick and they had mono and that was due from studying, staying up all night and studying and getting your body run down.

16:48.076 --> 16:48.537
All right.

16:49.057 --> 16:54.343
Had a kid died about that time, but he got bit on a cross-country course.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.425
He was state champion.

16:56.445 --> 16:58.187
This was later.

16:58.288 --> 17:00.570
I don't even know what year it was, but he died.

17:00.650 --> 17:06.417
He had, what do they call it, something bites you.

17:06.437 --> 17:06.597
Radies?

17:07.618 --> 17:15.467
No, a mosquito or something bit him, and he lost his mind.

17:16.730 --> 17:18.253
They call me at the college hospital.

17:18.273 --> 17:23.882
I go up to the college hospital, and he's standing behind the door in the college hospital.

17:24.564 --> 17:26.888
And he's just standing there in the corner.

17:27.228 --> 17:29.111
And he's been there all day and night.

17:29.713 --> 17:34.601
And they said, we can't get a hold of his parents because he don't know their phone number.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.506
So I called the parents, and right quick,

17:37.891 --> 17:44.442
They said, we want you to get the parents to give us permission to operate, send them to the hospital or something.

17:45.404 --> 17:49.330
And so anyway, I had to get a hold of the parents, and they gave me permission right off the bat.

17:49.350 --> 17:52.375
But anyway, in about three or four days, he died.

17:53.337 --> 17:57.223
And I take the whole, I charter a Greyhound bus, just like a track meet.

17:57.724 --> 18:01.350
We take the whole track team to the way up at...

18:02.731 --> 18:06.976
Oh, outside of Dallas, about a two-way school up there.

18:08.438 --> 18:11.182
But anyway, he didn't have that mono.

18:11.222 --> 18:13.284
He had something.

18:13.304 --> 18:14.746
They claimed a mosquito bit him.

18:15.587 --> 18:25.900
As you were recruiting, how important was it to persuade mother and father of the prospective recruit that this was- That was the number one thing.

18:26.180 --> 18:26.801
How did you do that?

18:27.442 --> 18:31.607
Well, I talked to the mothers and everything.

18:32.515 --> 18:54.540
give you an instance on that my first black that i tried to recruit this was two years before i signed curtis mills i mean i knew see when i was running uh in like 1955 i was voted the world's fastest 220 man well for about four or five years

18:55.415 --> 19:00.741
The only person that ever beat me would be a black at NCAA or some of those big meets, you know.

19:01.401 --> 19:13.334
But anyway, when I came to A&M, after several, four or five years, I don't know how long I was here, I decided I had to recruit, start recruiting blacks.

19:13.354 --> 19:21.822
But the first black, I think I told you this, was from Palestine, and he was, I mean, I went and watched him run in a track meeting.

19:21.882 --> 19:24.325
He'd run a nine, 400-yard dash and just,

19:25.030 --> 19:29.017
shut it off, you know, run 21 flat and a 220, just kind of dog crotch.

19:29.898 --> 19:32.162
And I said, man, I got to have him.

19:32.202 --> 19:33.364
So I started recruiting him.

19:34.445 --> 19:39.173
And I'd go to the house right before school was out.

19:39.854 --> 19:41.537
About 3.30, he'd come home, you know.

19:41.757 --> 19:43.721
I'd go, I found that boy's house.

19:43.741 --> 19:46.465
And the first time I went to the house, he lived in a little long.

19:46.917 --> 19:57.012
little, long, narrow house, had a front porch, real narrow, front porch had a fling on it, had a screen door, but the screen door was all tore out and everything.

19:58.314 --> 20:12.935
I drove up there right in front, didn't have a fence around the house, I drove right up in front of the house and someone was in the fling, I opened the door, and when I opened the door to get out, this woman stood up in the fling and said, stay there, don't get out, don't get out.

20:13.556 --> 20:16.080
She come down off the steps out to the car and said, what do you want?

20:16.685 --> 20:18.888
I said, well, I'm a track coach at Texas A&M.

20:18.928 --> 20:20.509
I said, so-and-so lives here, doesn't he?

20:20.549 --> 20:21.831
He said, yeah, yeah, he lives here.

20:21.891 --> 20:23.613
I said, that's my grandson.

20:24.954 --> 20:25.835
Yeah, he lives here.

20:25.855 --> 20:27.237
I said, well, I come to talk to him.

20:27.297 --> 20:29.019
I want him to try to get him to go to Texas A&M.

20:29.039 --> 20:29.980
She said, oh, okay.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.482
Then I started walking up.

20:31.502 --> 20:32.823
She said, no, you sat back down in the car.

20:33.224 --> 20:34.085
So I sat back down.

20:34.185 --> 20:35.026
She shut the door.

20:35.346 --> 20:38.109
She stood up there and talked to him until he came home.

20:40.412 --> 20:42.054
We stood there for about five minutes.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.176
Then she said, well, you better go, coach.

20:44.196 --> 20:44.717
You better go.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.856
So boy, I said, I'm coming back here.

20:47.896 --> 20:50.141
So I go back the next week.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.343
I drive up there in the same thing.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.265
She's sitting in front.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.409
And I open the door.

20:54.429 --> 20:56.974
She heard her, stay there, stay there.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.659
And I had to sit in the car until the boy had come.

20:59.679 --> 21:00.681
The third time.

21:01.522 --> 21:07.893
I drive up there, and she's in that frame, and he's going to be out of school, you know, coming home in about five or ten minutes.

21:07.973 --> 21:08.955
I timed it just right.

21:09.596 --> 21:18.472
Anyway, instead of me just getting out slow, I jump out, slam the door, and jump up on the front porch, and she stands up and kind of shakes her up.

21:18.632 --> 21:20.796
She said, you can sit down there.

21:21.029 --> 21:25.193
It had one chair, one chair on the front porch.

21:25.213 --> 21:37.186
So we sat down there, and then when we visited, you know, all right, the next time I come, I get out, she's sitting on the front porch, and I get out, and she didn't say anything.

21:37.206 --> 21:38.027
She said, come on in.

21:38.367 --> 21:40.189
I walk up the front porch to sit down there.

21:40.609 --> 21:47.056
Well, after a while, we're sitting there, and she's always, every now and then, she'd be drinking a cup of coffee in a little tin cup.

21:47.076 --> 21:49.078
Well, I didn't even ask her anything, you know.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.519
She was sitting there drinking that coffee.

21:50.539 --> 21:54.963
So I go into the kitchen, see the pot, and I pour me another coffee cup.

21:54.983 --> 21:55.404
I pour it.

21:55.844 --> 21:56.625
She said, where are you going?

21:56.645 --> 21:58.046
I said, I'm going to get me a cup of coffee.

21:58.066 --> 21:58.987
She didn't say anything.

21:59.027 --> 22:03.371
I come back, sit down, and that time I sat down with her.

22:03.511 --> 22:04.932
We drank that coffee and we talked.

22:06.474 --> 22:09.717
From that day on, I had a good chance of getting that track guy.

22:11.518 --> 22:13.540
I don't know if I told you this or not.

22:13.560 --> 22:17.884
All right, about a week or two weeks later, time for him to visit.

22:18.252 --> 22:20.174
He was running track.

22:20.214 --> 22:21.576
Anyway, state track meet was over.

22:21.776 --> 22:25.361
We couldn't sign him until one week after the state track meet.

22:26.342 --> 22:30.908
If they ran this Saturday at the state meet, that's what was legal in all those years.

22:30.948 --> 22:33.131
The next week you can sign him.

22:33.151 --> 22:37.977
So the next week after he won the state, I had him come to visit.

22:38.378 --> 22:42.623
He was supposed to have got in there about 10 o'clock Saturday morning.

22:43.362 --> 22:50.791
About 12 o'clock he never did show up, so I go in the office up there and I call the boy's house and the grandmother answers the phone.

22:51.472 --> 22:53.995
I said, where's, I can't remember the boy's name.

22:54.035 --> 22:56.838
I said, where's the truck guy?

22:57.499 --> 22:59.962
Oh, he said, I'm not going to let him visit.

23:00.062 --> 23:03.586
He said, is the white coach going to bring him down there?

23:03.626 --> 23:06.970
She said, I'm not going to let him drive down there at Texas A&M with the white coach.

23:06.990 --> 23:11.175
He said, that coach will leave him there and come back and he won't ever have a way to get back home.

23:12.050 --> 23:12.691
I said, oh, my.

23:13.612 --> 23:17.838
So then I get to think, what can I do?

23:17.878 --> 23:19.160
So I called a high school.

23:19.781 --> 23:22.425
I knew more coaches, and they gave me a black coach.

23:23.446 --> 23:27.352
I called that black coach, and he said, I'll bring him down there tonight.

23:27.472 --> 23:28.754
So he comes down there.

23:28.774 --> 23:33.981
He brings him down there that night, and he spends the night and visits, and he goes back home.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.184
The next week, I said, man, I'm going to go sign him.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.769
So I drive up there.

23:40.690 --> 23:42.773
No, he signed with Texas Southern.

23:43.814 --> 23:51.143
He signed with Texas Southern, and then about two years later, he was Olympic champion and set the world record in the 100-yard bag.

23:51.164 --> 23:59.655
But then the next year is when I got a couple of the blacks I was recruiting that year, and they didn't get them.

23:59.675 --> 24:06.323
Did you ever hear from him why he didn't come here, why he went to Texas Southern?

24:06.343 --> 24:06.964
No, uh-uh.

24:07.231 --> 24:09.053
I never did get that close to him.

24:09.754 --> 24:15.321
Well, yeah, the main reason he didn't, there wasn't any blacks at A&M.

24:15.921 --> 24:23.911
And that's what she told me, that he didn't want to, he couldn't come to A&M because he'd be the only black there.

24:23.931 --> 24:30.078
See, Lamar had integrated in University of Houston, and they were both getting a lot of those players.

24:30.939 --> 24:35.044
Now, did we, at the time you were recruiting, trying to recruit black athletes,

24:35.345 --> 24:38.438
Did we already officially have some black students on the campus?

24:39.422 --> 24:39.984
There wasn't any.

24:40.426 --> 24:45.186
There was, I was reading some of these books, I think there was a guy in the

24:45.520 --> 24:46.742
majoring to be a doctor.

24:47.563 --> 24:52.832
I mean, he didn't graduate from A&M, but there wasn't any students at A&M, there wasn't any.

24:53.453 --> 25:07.377
Because then when I was recruiting Curtis Mills and those guys, I already had made up my mind, I was going to recruit four blacks so I could take a room together because you had two in a room using the same bathroom, four of them using the same bathroom.

25:07.694 --> 25:19.107
I thought it'd be all right because when I made trips overseas when I was a senior in college, I roomed with black sprinters all the time and got along great with them.

25:19.949 --> 25:21.012
I grew up with blacks.

25:21.582 --> 25:23.164
you know, in East Texas.

25:23.504 --> 25:27.348
Did anybody at A&M ever speak against your recruiting blacks?

25:28.430 --> 25:29.431
No, no one.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.975
I never got one letter from an Aggie.

25:33.996 --> 25:36.539
And nobody in the athletic department?

25:36.599 --> 25:39.362
No, everybody was happy that we got them.

25:40.243 --> 25:41.945
Who was your first black coach?

25:42.025 --> 25:42.605
Curtis Mills.

25:42.886 --> 25:43.967
Curtis was the first?

25:45.449 --> 25:50.374
And then when I signed Curtis, he was the first one I signed, but I had

25:50.742 --> 25:55.990
I had four of them to visit at the same time, and I ended up signing all four of those.

25:56.250 --> 26:03.642
When I got Curtis to visit, I had these other three from, to visit from Houston that I recruited.

26:03.662 --> 26:04.863
Curtis went to High School O'Brien.

26:05.104 --> 26:05.905
And Lufkin.

26:06.085 --> 26:06.466
Lufkin.

26:06.486 --> 26:07.307
He was from Lufkin.

26:07.327 --> 26:09.190
Describe recruiting him.

26:09.210 --> 26:19.045
Well, all right, we had a, the way I found him, we had this black guy that was a shoeshine boy over at MSC.

26:20.324 --> 26:32.829
He was a high school star football player at the old Bryan Kemp High School.

26:32.969 --> 26:42.147
Anyway, he was a part-time student off and on at A&M and he was working his way through by being a shoeshine boy.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.051
He was a track athlete.

26:44.271 --> 26:46.416
Later on, he coached in Houston and around.

26:46.457 --> 26:48.882
But anyway, we'd talk all the time.

26:49.644 --> 26:55.397
And I told him, I asked him would he go to Prairie View to the state track meet.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.402
See, we had a track meet at the same time.

26:57.888 --> 27:01.656
It was a week before the white track meet.

27:01.676 --> 27:04.842
Then we, you know, call them white track meet, black track meet, state meet.

27:05.684 --> 27:09.551
And the black track meet was a week before state, white track meet.

27:09.571 --> 27:14.201
But anyway, nobody ever went to the black track meet because we didn't recruit them, you know.

27:14.221 --> 27:18.129
But anyway, I decided to, I sent Arthur Dunn his name, Arthur Dunn.

27:19.612 --> 27:19.812
All right.

27:20.011 --> 27:25.859
I sent Arthur Dunn to go to Prairie View to the track meet and I gave him a whole stack of cards.

27:25.959 --> 27:33.850
I had these cards made out with my name and you put your grade average and all this and that on there and what event you're in and your best distances.

27:34.831 --> 27:38.316
And that was my first thing that I would get when I would recruit somebody.

27:38.496 --> 27:43.723
By mail, if I'd write them a letter, I'd send them that card, you know, with a stamp on it where they didn't even have to buy a stamp, send it back.

27:44.378 --> 27:46.340
But anyway, I gave him a whole stack of cards.

27:46.380 --> 27:53.849
He went to, I said, I want every, the greatest guy, they got high jumpers, pole vaulters, whatever's good that you think can come to A&M, I'm gonna recruit.

27:53.869 --> 27:59.475
I told him I'm gonna recruit four blacks and I wanna get the best four there was out of state of Texas.

28:00.015 --> 28:06.763
So he came back with a bunch of cards and he said, the number one and number two guys from Lufkin High School, he said, this guy is number one.

28:06.783 --> 28:09.826
He said, this guy, Curtis Mills, says he's number two.

28:10.227 --> 28:13.170
He said, you get those two, he said, you won't have to get for two more.

28:13.150 --> 28:18.236
You know, he had a whole bunch of cars filled out, but he said go to Luskin.

28:18.256 --> 28:26.046
So the next day, I mean, I head to Luskin and I get the track coach and I show him those two cars that they filled out.

28:26.967 --> 28:30.151
And he said, well, he said, this is, he just looked at the car.

28:30.191 --> 28:32.073
He said, this is, this is the guy you want to get.

28:33.014 --> 28:34.976
He said, you can't have this guy.

28:34.996 --> 28:36.658
I said, what's the matter with this guy?

28:36.678 --> 28:38.320
He said, oh, he can't even read and write.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.423
He said, there ain't no way he can go to Texas.

28:40.403 --> 28:43.246
He said, now he's the number one track guy.

28:43.787 --> 28:48.092
But he said, this guy, Curtis Mills, he said, he's a good track man, he's fast, he's smart.

28:48.132 --> 28:51.496
He said, he's got brothers and sisters that's smart.

28:51.516 --> 28:57.343
He said, Curtis Mills had a sister that could outrun Curtis.

28:57.363 --> 29:02.169
I found out about this later on, but he had a sister that could outrun Curtis.

29:02.189 --> 29:04.471
But that was when they were about eight or 10 years old.

29:05.212 --> 29:08.436
So anyway, I ended up signing Curtis Mills.

29:09.563 --> 29:13.126
And then I'd go to Houston and get those other three guys.

29:14.027 --> 29:20.493
And that first year when they, were there any problems for them being accepted by the student body?

29:20.513 --> 29:23.475
No, I didn't have any problems.

29:23.495 --> 29:23.735
All right.

29:23.755 --> 29:32.543
In those early years, academically, how did y'all get the freshmen, get them involved?

29:32.563 --> 29:38.288
Well, see, that's hard to the, at the time I knew that,

29:38.639 --> 29:49.061
I felt like the blacks' grades might not be quite as good, but I found out fast that Worthing High School was a big, top-notch high school.

29:49.101 --> 29:51.045
I mean, the city of Houston, there wasn't three blacks

29:51.481 --> 30:13.641
school in the whole city of Houston so Worthing had a high class deal and when I went over and when I was recruiting I told that coach over there I said I want four a year just before I found Curtis I said I want at least four three or four a year best athletes and he had a bunch of good ones and I said of course I want them

30:13.621 --> 30:15.984
to good grades where they can go to Texas A&M.

30:16.044 --> 30:18.707
I said, I don't want them flunking out because they're going to be the first blacks.

30:18.787 --> 30:19.869
I want to be sure they can pass.

30:19.889 --> 30:22.792
So anyway, he brought those guys in there, four of them.

30:23.914 --> 30:25.856
And I ended up signing three of them.

30:26.377 --> 30:27.198
I didn't want four of them.

30:27.218 --> 30:28.479
I didn't have four scholarships.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.201
So I dropped one of them.

30:30.221 --> 30:43.257
I don't even know who I dropped, but I picked out the top three because I could get them because they knew each other better than you can get one from here and one from over there, especially when you didn't have a single white guy on campus.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.007
And they all knew that, you know.

30:46.649 --> 30:57.681
But the deal on Hugh McElroy, Hugh McElroy, he said, Hugh McElroy ran a 9.7 last year as a junior coach, but he said he's not even running track this year.

30:57.741 --> 30:58.382
I said, what?

30:58.763 --> 31:00.084
He said, no, he gave up track.

31:00.104 --> 31:01.466
He said, he's on the swimming team.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.030
But he said, he's the best athlete we got.

31:05.550 --> 31:06.932
He said, I tell you what, he said,

31:07.604 --> 31:11.429
You can't throw a football 100 yards that he can't catch.

31:11.529 --> 31:14.994
He said, you know where you throw a football out there, he can catch it.

31:15.775 --> 31:19.640
And he was about 5' 11", 5' 10", had a big long arm, big shoulder.

31:20.381 --> 31:23.185
And he said he's the best swimmer.

31:23.245 --> 31:26.710
He said he's a sprint swimmer, just like a sprinter on track.
