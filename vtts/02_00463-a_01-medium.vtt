00:03.575 --> 00:14.167
This is an interview with Mary Garrison by Rose 
George on April 14, 1990 at Mrs. Garrison's home

00:03.575 --> 00:14.167
concerning her nursing in Vietnam. And in the 
interest of accumulating knowledge, I'm asking

00:14.187 --> 00:24.299
you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral 
History Collection in the University Archives.

00:24.319 --> 00:25.600
Is that all right with you? That is

00:25.881 --> 00:30.526
fine. OK. So when and where were you born? I was born 
September 17, 1945, in Christian County,

00:33.342 --> 00:39.555
Illinois. And where did you get your education? I 
went to local schools, a parochial school in

00:43.378 --> 00:47.982
Morrisonville, Illinois. It's a small Catholic 
school. And then a high school at Morrisonville

00:49.483 --> 00:54.448
Community High School. And then college, I 
graduated from St. Louis University in St. Louis.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.756
And then where did you go to nursing school? That 
was St. Louis University School of Nursing and

01:03.776 --> 01:10.082
Health Sciences. Why did you decide to go into the 
Army? At the time, there was a student nurse

01:13.718 --> 01:17.943
program. You could join at the beginning of either 
your junior or senior year and have an obligation

01:18.083 --> 01:25.533
of two or three years. The Army picked up the tab, 
the total tab, for tuition, fees,

01:26.494 --> 01:37.629
room and board. We were paid first as... PFCs in the 
WAC, Women's Army Corps. And then six months

01:44.859 --> 01:55.893
before we graduated, we were commissioned second 
lieutenants, and our pay went up accordingly.

01:56.113 --> 02:04.825
During senior year, I was getting $348 a month, 
plus school was paid for, and I owed two years. I had

02:05.385 --> 02:07.508
done it during my senior year. And did you intend to 
go to Vietnam? Vietnam was the farthest thing from

02:13.403 --> 02:15.426
my mind. Even when I got to basic training at Fort 
San Houston, that was in November of 67.

02:27.965 --> 02:31.690
We were told then, and something should have told 
us, I mean, this should have told us that something

02:33.526 --> 02:37.150
was going on. It was a very, very large class, 
probably 300 in the class. But we were told that no

02:43.257 --> 02:52.186
one,

02:43.257 --> 02:52.186
no nurses were in Vietnam except those who had 
volunteered to go. They were actively recruiting

02:52.206 --> 02:57.512
the male nurses at that time. And there were 
between 40 and 50 of them in that class. And they

03:01.216 --> 03:03.178
were asking for volunteers. By May, most of the 
people that I knew from that basic class already

03:04.981 --> 03:11.728
had orders to go. So things changed very

03:11.748 --> 03:18.075
quickly. What did you consider to be your main 
reason for being in Vietnam? Well, to help care for

03:24.202 --> 03:29.708
the wounded. The motto

03:35.069 --> 03:41.096
The theme of the Medical Service Corps is to 
conserve the fighting strength. And I took that to

03:41.116 --> 03:49.605
mean saving lives, taking

03:41.116 --> 03:49.605
care of the wounded. And how much nursing 
experience did you have before you went to

03:49.625 --> 03:54.111
Vietnam? Not that much. I went on active duty in the 
Army in September of 67. And of course we didn't get

04:04.786 --> 04:14.062
to our first duty station until

04:04.786 --> 04:14.062
early November. And I was in Vietnam the next 
September, September of 68, so less than a year of

04:14.303 --> 04:24.060
active duty work. After I graduated in the summer, 
from June until September, we could not go on to

04:24.901 --> 04:35.336
active duty until we had passed our state boards. I 
had taken those in June, but we didn't get results

04:35.937 --> 04:43.127
until early September.

04:43.528 --> 04:46.432
How did they prepare you before you went? Well, we 
had a five-week basic course at Port Sam. We

04:52.781 --> 04:53.963
learned military protocol you know the marching 
saluting how to wear the uniforms and there are

04:54.483 --> 05:10.382
several uniforms

04:54.483 --> 05:10.382
they had several ways of making sure that we knew 
how to wear the uniform The blue, the army dress

05:12.337 --> 05:15.622
blues are a little different. The insignia is just 
a little bit different. And so that inspection was

05:18.867 --> 05:31.306
a cocktail party where we all had to appear and be 
presented to the general and so on. We had classes

05:31.326 --> 05:36.574
on the military paperwork. It's different in 
military hospitals. than it is from civilian

05:39.640 --> 05:42.343
hospitals. They have their own forms and nursing 
notes are much abbreviated in some cases, in many

05:42.383 --> 05:53.356
cases.

05:53.556 --> 06:03.447
And so we had to learn how to use the paperwork.

06:03.467 --> 06:08.753
We went out probably every day for a week to Camp 
Bullis. and wore our fatigues and ate from our mess

06:09.982 --> 06:22.844
kits and attended classes on weapons 
familiarization. We did not, the women nurses did

06:22.864 --> 06:28.513
not shoot guns. We sat and watched these 
demonstrations, but we did not actually fire

06:29.472 --> 06:35.478
weapons. The men did. The men bivouacked 
overnight, a couple of

06:37.119 --> 06:44.766
nights. We were always treated like, this is fun, 
hey. At the end of the day, when they bussed us back

06:50.632 --> 06:59.260
into town, and it was a good 25 or 30 miles back into 
town, they dropped us off first at the pit which was

06:59.729 --> 07:08.419
the medical field service school's officers 
club, and a real rocking place. I mean, it was fun.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.661
It was a lot of fun. And they wanted us back there. 
One day, they brought the Fort Sam Houston band out

07:16.067 --> 07:23.596
to Camp Bullis, and the band played for us during 
lunch. One day, we had... field rations, sea

07:27.438 --> 07:36.791
rations, for lunch.

07:36.811 --> 07:37.532
What were some other things we did? We went into 
laboratories and practiced starting IVs,

07:37.892 --> 07:53.454
practiced doing tracheotomies.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.757
It seems like there was another procedure we 
practiced. on goats. They had anesthetized the

07:58.378 --> 08:13.716
goats and there'd be three or four of us at each 
station with each goat practicing these

07:58.378 --> 08:13.716
things. We had lectures on,

08:13.736 --> 08:26.031
one lecture was on triage, how the casualties 
would be divided you know, what decided or how it

08:27.631 --> 08:36.488
was decided who went into surgery first.

08:36.508 --> 08:40.897
They had a mock-up Vietnamese village, which was, 
you know, just laughable. It was nothing like the

08:40.917 --> 08:45.606
villages really were.

08:54.428 --> 08:59.036
And what was your unit assignment and where were 
you assigned? I went to the 24th of Ag Hospital on

08:59.056 --> 09:04.506
Long Bend Post. That was about 16 miles, I think 
southeast, sort of southeast of Saigon. They were

09:15.126 --> 09:18.732
separated by a big interstate highway. It was just 
a real quick trip by car into Saigon, or a quick by

09:19.927 --> 09:27.956
chopper, too. There were two... Long Bend Post was 
a huge post, probably the size of Fort Sam Houston.

09:37.948 --> 09:40.811
Just really big, and it was just nothing but Army. 
It was an area that had been scraped clean. And then

09:44.175 --> 09:46.778
Army built... Army... buildings put up and a big 
perimeter around it. And it served as a, I think it

09:51.031 --> 09:59.140
really grew up, I heard once, really grew up after 
Tet. They got a lot of the headquarters or whatever

09:59.160 --> 10:08.810
out of Saigon and onto this place where they could 
really secure them. They had a big population of

10:08.830 --> 10:10.932
generals. They had acres and acres of, you know, 
buildings or house trailers where senior

10:17.555 --> 10:26.887
officers lived. There was a big jail there, I mean a 
huge jail. Anyone in country that had to be put up a

10:30.131 --> 10:39.462
while was brought down to the LBJ.

10:40.302 --> 10:42.285
There was another evac hospital. It was on the 
perimeter, and when I was given a choice, you know,

10:42.706 --> 10:47.252
where I wanted to go, and that surprised me. I had no 
idea I'd get to choose where I wanted to go. It was

10:51.919 --> 11:01.133
explained that the 93rd was on the perimeter, and 
occasionally took small arms fire, and the 24th

10:51.919 --> 11:01.133
was more of a center of the post. I said, I want that 
one. And I was tired also of... You know, it had been

11:07.319 --> 11:11.684
a 23 hour trip over there. And I was very, very tired 
and I was a little bit leery about traveling up

11:13.226 --> 11:19.113
country too. I didn't think it was safe to go in a 
jeep anywhere and I didn't think it was safe to go in

11:19.173 --> 11:24.460
a chopper anywhere. So I was real glad to just stay 
right there. And what were the living conditions

11:28.985 --> 11:32.830
like? Very good. You know, very simple, but much 
better than I expected.

11:42.937 --> 11:48.061
We had four long wooden buildings. There was a 
fifth one. That was the one in the middle. That one

11:51.324 --> 11:54.267
housed the Officers Club. But then there were two 
on either side that housed 10 to 12 rooms. And these

12:02.255 --> 12:04.697
were private rooms. The buildings were designed 
to, you know, not be air-conditioned. They were

12:10.611 --> 12:16.323
screened and the walls were wooden slats out like 
louvers. More than halfway up and then big

12:16.483 --> 12:20.492
screened-in windows and then we're known. no 
ceilings. Well, people had improved on those

12:21.760 --> 12:33.993
quite a bit over time, and right away, somebody 
insisted on building in my wall. I already had a

12:34.714 --> 12:47.087
ceiling, and we shared a bathroom on the latrine, 
about three sinks and three stalls. couple of

12:47.911 --> 12:52.676
showers, but they were all inside that, you know, 
that building. Concrete floors. You know, we

12:55.819 --> 13:01.826
brought things in and it really made them pretty 
comfortable. I had a bed with an innerspring

13:01.846 --> 13:10.856
mattress.

13:10.876 --> 13:11.396
Certainly not an army cot. Not a swayback army cot. 
And how did you react to the injuries that you saw

13:14.675 --> 13:19.280
when you first got there? The injuries?

13:23.906 --> 13:32.616
I think I was just sort of numbed by the whole trip 
over and just, you know, accepted what I saw. These

13:33.217 --> 13:40.806
things stuck in my mind and I never forgot them or 
eventually, you know, I started remembering them

13:33.217 --> 13:40.806
again. But I don't remember ever turning away, you 
know, being repulsed, not being able to look at

13:43.885 --> 13:55.906
them or not being able to do for them. I mentioned 
triage. One of the stages of triage

13:58.290 --> 14:07.446
is a stage called expectant. And that's the stage 
that you just don't try to do anything for. You can

14:11.780 --> 14:16.569
tell that these people are still alive but they are 
terribly wounded. Their wounds are going to

14:16.609 --> 14:24.164
require hours and hours and hours of surgery and 
then maybe you still won't get a good result. The

14:25.025 --> 14:28.692
hospital I was assigned to was the neurosurgery 
and maxillofacial surgery center for all of the

14:29.195 --> 14:39.068
South, the South part of South Vietnam, for three 
and four core. And we had a 50 bed neurosurgery

14:39.088 --> 14:46.237
ward. Well, it was 45 to 50 beds. And, well, I don't 
know how many beds for the maxillofacial.

14:54.187 --> 14:56.851
certainly it was no more than one ward. But the 
patients of ours that were labeled expectant were

14:57.712 --> 15:06.184
the head injured. They were out of it and they knew 
nothing. There's a certain way of stimulating

15:11.732 --> 15:17.661
them that gives you a certain reflex that tells you 
that the brain is gone. We did not have EEG

15:17.681 --> 15:20.785
machines. You know, it was the equivalent of, you 
know, these were flatline head injuries. And yet

15:28.210 --> 15:31.474
they lived for a while. They could live for days. 
And the thing I do remember is the very first day I

15:34.317 --> 15:48.072
worked, and that was probably five or six days 
after I had gone to that hospital, or a good week

15:34.317 --> 15:48.072
after I'd come in country. That first day, there 
were two American GIs that came in as expectants,

15:48.288 --> 15:59.642
and they were

15:48.288 --> 15:59.642
put at the back of the ward and just left there. And 
then, you know, the things I had heard at Fort Sam

16:01.084 --> 16:05.710
made sense. Back then, to me, it was something to 
learn for a test. I mean, it really had no... Well, I

16:10.355 --> 16:18.025
suppose at that time, I never thought I'd be in 
Vietnam, for one thing. And then it really did hit

16:18.393 --> 16:23.980
home that this is real. I was assigned to the pre-op 
and recovery ward. The back end of the ward was

16:29.808 --> 16:45.008
pre-op, where we held patients, kept them 
stabilized, watched them, gave them additional

16:29.808 --> 16:45.008
pain medicine if need be, hung extra blood and IV 
fluids, reinforced their bandages, talked to

16:29.808 --> 16:45.008
them. Just held them there until it was their turn 
to go into surgery, which was next door to us. And

16:50.411 --> 16:54.215
then the front half of the ward was set up as a 
recovery ward. And it had everything around each

16:54.235 --> 17:01.442
bed that you'd find here, or that you would have 
found 20 years ago. And they came out of surgery

17:01.462 --> 17:10.451
wrapped up, bandaged in clean bandages, white 
bandages. And they looked like what you would find

17:10.531 --> 17:14.235
back home after an accident. But the fellows as 
they went in were still on the litters that they had

17:14.452 --> 17:19.923
been picked up on. Their clothes had been cut away, 
but they were still lying in what remained of their

17:21.987 --> 17:26.796
clothes. Some of their bandages were the green 
field dressing bandages. They had dirt, crud, you

17:32.387 --> 17:37.236
know, they had the whole thing still attached to 
them. They never did get really cleaned off.

17:45.465 --> 17:55.517
Somebody who has done primarily OR or operating 
room nursing would just really be appalled at what

17:45.465 --> 17:55.517
we sent into the operating room. I mean, we sent 
them in very dirty. And

17:58.100 --> 18:07.071
there were some places that did attempt to clean 
them off better before they sent them into, even

18:07.979 --> 18:11.583
into the hospital. The third field hospital in 
Saigon had a set of showers set up, shower heads set

18:12.444 --> 18:24.817
up at the edge of their helipad. And before they 
even took them into the hospital, they hosed them

18:25.698 --> 18:28.662
down. You can imagine, you know, just being, you 
know, those guys were already shocky from their

18:29.202 --> 18:36.450
wounds. And then to get a blast of probably cold 
water.

18:46.405 --> 18:47.607
I don't know, I've forgotten the question. The 
injuries.

18:57.820 --> 19:03.187
The expectant head patients, I said, were kept put 
in a corner in the back. I don't remember ever

19:03.968 --> 19:05.610
seeing them up. another time when we had two 
Americans there together. It was not unusual to

19:10.308 --> 19:14.114
have two patients back there. You know, we 
received Vietnamese patients, civilians, the

19:14.134 --> 19:22.226
Arvins. We had VC Viet Cong and we had NVA, the North 
Vietnamese Army.

19:33.843 --> 19:35.125
We also had Cambodians at times. We had Koreans. We 
called them ROKs, Republic

19:41.829 --> 19:50.528
of Korean Soldiers. There was a Korean soldier who 
came in once.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.613
He was not really expected. He could have lived a 
while. He had a very high spinal cord injury.

20:11.041 --> 20:21.571
Spinal cord injuries, whatever part of the spinal 
cord, they qualified as surgery patients and they

20:11.041 --> 20:21.571
would come to our hospital too. He'd had a very high 
one and the cord was severed so high that he wasn't

20:21.591 --> 20:27.336
able to breathe on his own. And he was brought in, 
and somebody was bagging him, you know, mashing

20:28.430 --> 20:37.843
the ambu bag, breathing for him. He had a trach put 
in, and two or three surgeons got into a fuss over

20:38.043 --> 20:47.656
him. We had a unit attached to our hospital called 
the RARE unit, the Walter Reed Army Institute of

20:48.377 --> 20:56.428
Research. And I think all of the major medical 
centers had a research team of some sort. Well,

21:04.567 --> 21:06.756
Rare was over there. attached to our hospital and 
doing trauma studies. And so anyone who had really

21:10.242 --> 21:14.587
gross trauma, they did studies on. They did blood 
tests. I don't know what else they did. I was aware

21:17.290 --> 21:19.272
of the blood tests. What I was most aware of was that 
they did blood gas studies on them. Actually, they

21:23.037 --> 21:29.164
went into the artery and got samples of blood and 
had the equipment to analyze it. This is not...

21:29.985 --> 21:34.330
Well, I don't know how sophisticated the 
equipment... The test is, but it's very necessary

21:34.765 --> 21:40.332
equipment when you're dealing with chest wounds. 
You need it for people

21:40.352 --> 21:50.405
who've had, may need it for people who've had heart 
attacks. There are a lot of things that are not

21:51.246 --> 22:02.680
terribly abnormal or out of the ordinary that you 
could use this test for, but it was not standard

21:51.246 --> 22:02.680
equipment even for an evacuation hospital. And in 
the back hospital, it was a pretty well-equipped

22:03.571 --> 22:11.519
hospital.

22:11.539 --> 22:22.090
Well, anyway, the rare team was there, and the 
doctor in charge wanted that patient for his test.

22:22.230 --> 22:23.591
He was not well-liked. He was kind of an obnoxious 
type, and he didn't want to take care of him

22:24.172 --> 22:31.479
afterwards. Most often, the patients, they'd 
They

22:33.541 --> 22:47.043
did the studies on the expectants and on others, 
but they did not assume responsibility for the

22:33.541 --> 22:47.043
patients afterwards. This fellow was going to 
need a respirator. He was going to have to be on the

22:56.592 --> 22:58.094
striker frame. It's a skinny little bed with sort 
of a sandwich. You can turn the patient from front

23:00.716 --> 23:02.979
to back. And you don't misalign his spinal cord by 
turning him that way. And you can turn him easily.

23:18.415 --> 23:23.740
And one doctor was screaming he was going to be 
tying up a respirator. Another one was screaming

23:24.181 --> 23:26.143
that Even if he lived and got out of our hospital 
without a major infection, he would get one soon as

23:26.478 --> 23:36.752
he got medevaced back to Korea. And the Koreans 
didn't have the rehab. This is what this was, was a

23:42.280 --> 23:45.945
rehab patient. Didn't have the rehab facilities 
to take care of him. And so the three, in their

23:50.711 --> 23:53.295
fussing and their fighting, I don't know that a 
neurosurgeon was ever there. I can't remember who

23:55.682 --> 23:59.028
the third fellow was. It may have been a 
neurosurgeon, but I just can't remember. The

24:05.658 --> 24:10.886
second was a general surgeon that was very, very 
good. He was just an extremely good surgeon.

24:15.353 --> 24:16.515
And I thought a lot of him. ended up the three of us 
felt most fellows um two of them decided they would

24:17.322 --> 24:43.667
put him down rather than take care of him and rather 
than let the rare team have him and then notice him

24:17.322 --> 24:43.667
the responsibility for him afterwards and it was 
all over very very quickly it was this big scene

24:17.322 --> 24:43.667
that you know the three of them were around yelling 
and the nursing staff was You

24:44.153 --> 24:59.976
know, started standing

24:44.153 --> 24:59.976
around, what is going on here? What's going to 
happen? And before you knew it, they had given this

25:00.596 --> 25:05.904
man a bolus of, I don't know what it was, morphine, 
Demo, and stopped bagging him. And he just, you

25:05.924 --> 25:07.326
know, he just went out and was dead very soon. This 
man had been trying to talk. Of course, he couldn't

25:09.842 --> 25:16.529
talk with the trach in his throat unless it 
recovered, and then he couldn't be back. But he was

25:16.849 --> 25:18.170
trying to talk. There was another Korean there who 
was watching this, who was telling him what was

25:18.210 --> 25:28.801
going on or, you know, asking questions of him. I 
thought about him a lot, not so much then. But in

25:34.373 --> 25:44.342
these later years, it was very unusual for him to 
have received medical care as quickly as he did.

25:44.483 --> 25:52.350
Someone very quickly put a trach in his throat and 
established an airway.

25:54.312 --> 25:58.716
Either had a bag or actually blew into his chest. He 
was trying to communicate. He was awake. You

26:03.803 --> 26:23.757
know, the man would have lived a while. He had 
things to say. And yet he was just put down. An

26:24.819 --> 26:26.462
American soldier would have been operated on, 
would have been given the chance. He may or may not

26:26.482 --> 26:27.904
have gotten home, but he would have been operated 
on.

26:35.849 --> 26:42.516
Another time,

26:35.849 --> 26:42.516
we were having a push of some sort. We call the mass 
cow situations, masses of casualties.

26:51.064 --> 26:59.453
We had a lot going on, a lot of patients in there, a 
lot of doctors coming and going on the way into

26:51.064 --> 26:59.453
surgery and so on. And this doctor came in pushing a 
patient And the doctor was frantic. This fellow

27:06.174 --> 27:12.584
had a tracheostomy and it was bleeding. It was 
bleeding from around it and bleeding a lot. And he

27:15.149 --> 27:16.110
was in distress. He wasn't getting enough air. And 
the doctor grabbed me. And I hadn't been there very

27:23.282 --> 27:26.106
long. And he said, I've got to revise this, this 
trach. And, you know, I just, I stayed there with

27:30.170 --> 27:33.175
him. He was very rattled. He was very scared 
himself. And I didn't realize until later he had

27:37.402 --> 27:42.350
not been in country very long himself. The fact 
that he was a doctor didn't make him any less immune

27:42.370 --> 27:52.347
to being shaken up by what he was, you know, 
involved in. But the time, it shook me that he was so

27:52.833 --> 27:56.698
shaken. But I just stayed right by him. I stayed at 
the patient's head right across the gurney from

27:59.321 --> 28:04.127
the doctor. And every time he asked for something, 
I grabbed somebody going by or caught somebody's

28:04.247 --> 28:10.996
eye and said, get me this, get me that. I didn't know 
what he was doing. I certainly couldn't advise

28:13.039 --> 28:14.901
him. But I calmed him down. I talked him through it. 
And You know, he did revise the thing, got it in so

28:23.073 --> 28:31.826
the fellow was breathing, and then they went off 
into surgery. And I have no idea what happened

28:31.846 --> 28:39.857
after

28:31.846 --> 28:39.857
that. One time, one of the orthopedic surgeons 
started working on a fellow. He just had a wound in

28:47.528 --> 28:52.455
his foot, and it was one of these self-inflicted 
wounds. And the surgeon was real mad about that. He

28:56.292 --> 28:59.115
was just being very judgmental and screaming and 
hollering. And carrying on, he asked for a tracer.

29:02.319 --> 29:04.542
He said, I think I can debride this a little bit 
here. I won't have to go into the,

29:04.662 --> 29:11.852
you know, open up an operating room just for this 
toe. And it was just the middle toe. And he started

29:15.476 --> 29:19.402
working on it, working on it. And the kid was 
screaming, giving more. when Lyda came, pretty

29:22.675 --> 29:28.622
soon he had amputated that toe. He thought he was 
just going to clean it up and tear away the dead

29:28.642 --> 29:34.668
skin. And so he ended up amputating that toe right 
there with just local anesthetic.

29:46.101 --> 29:52.648
We had doctors who couldn't let go of their 
patients.

29:57.100 --> 30:00.044
They had a pretty good success rate. I don't 
remember the exact statistics anymore. But it was

30:05.410 --> 30:15.123
like 95% of the men who were picked up alive off the 
battlefield and brought to a hospital lived. Now,

30:16.104 --> 30:18.247
of course, there were degrees of living. But it was 
amazing how many people did live with really

30:19.428 --> 30:26.517
horrendous wounds. But they, you know, they 
didn't like, they didn't like losing. And I

30:33.400 --> 30:46.961
remember a patient who just went, he threw a

30:33.400 --> 30:46.961
fatty embolus, a fat clot. It's a little worse 
than, it's worse than a blood clot.

30:52.838 --> 31:00.145
People can recover, but it's a major problem when 
they do this. And this fellow did not recover. He

31:02.368 --> 31:04.410
had a respiratory arrest. We went through all 
that. I don't remember him ever being really awake

31:07.993 --> 31:11.176
after that. And he was on a respirator. And he kept 
going downhill

31:13.899 --> 31:19.825
to the point of... He couldn't suction him. He had a 
tracheostomy that was attached to the

31:24.316 --> 31:30.085
respirator.

31:30.505 --> 31:34.271
If you take him off the respirator long enough to 
suction him, he'd stop. I mean, he was getting no

31:34.391 --> 31:41.482
blood at all and no circulation. And yet the doctor 
would scream at you to suction him. I remember, you

31:48.712 --> 31:54.721
know, it was very obvious to me and everyone around 
us that this guy was gone. He was just gone and had

31:54.962 --> 32:03.655
been on the respirator, you know, long past the 
time he should have been on it. He just barely

32:03.675 --> 32:11.968
disconnected and his eyes were dilate

32:03.675 --> 32:11.968
and he was waxy looking. And I remember having to 
tell the doctor, just, you know, let it go. He's

32:18.438 --> 32:21.982
gone.

32:22.002 --> 32:22.543
You've got to take it home. I guess after so much 
time expended on a

32:22.563 --> 32:33.034
patient, you know, they can't save themselves. 
This is

32:33.054 --> 32:37.299
it for some care. There was a patient... He was on a 
striker frame because he had so many wounds, but he

32:39.623 --> 32:47.532
was difficult to turn and to manage. This recovery 
end of the ward, it also functioned as our ICU, our

32:47.552 --> 32:55.320
intensive care unit. There was no other place in 
the hospital where the lights were always on and

32:55.340 --> 33:06.272
where these difficult patients could be handled.

33:07.552 --> 33:11.098
Any times, usually a recovery patient stayed with 
us for one hour. That was about it. But the others,

33:13.041 --> 33:15.506
we might have them for days and days. And so often 
when we had them that long, that's the way they

33:15.826 --> 33:19.132
left. I mean, they never went in. They never, they 
died rather than going to another ward. And this

33:25.723 --> 33:28.648
fellow was one. He had so many wounds all over. He 
was just a multiple fragment wounded patient. And

33:36.924 --> 33:43.309
that's the way they were carried, multiple 
fragments.

33:43.329 --> 33:44.270
And he had gotten infected. The wounds there were 
not only the rips and tears, but these guys were

33:45.511 --> 33:53.498
dirty when they were shot. They were apt to have 
whatever was near them was apt to be blown into

33:58.362 --> 34:01.407
their wound too. Or they fell into more yuck and 
gucky stuff. Infection was just a real problem.

34:13.387 --> 34:17.974
And he was badly infected.

34:18.595 --> 34:21.679
He was pretty much out of it. He was running a fever. 
He was delirious. This fennel lasted for about a

34:24.303 --> 34:28.528
week. He lasted days. I don't know how long it was. 
He was skinny. He was sort of light,

34:34.076 --> 34:37.661
auburn-haired.

34:40.044 --> 34:43.749
The sicker he got, the less we did for him in the way 
of shaving. His beard was growing. He was

34:48.160 --> 34:49.141
thin-faced. He seemed to get thinner. He was faced 
longer and bags under his eyes, deeper and longer

34:50.804 --> 34:57.955
as the days went on. He didn't have much to say. When 
he was talking, he was kind of a country hick.

35:06.147 --> 35:13.999
He was on this skinny bed that was barely as wide as 
his shoulders.

35:14.772 --> 35:17.557
There's no place for your arms on those striker 
frames. They put out arm boards so that, you know,

35:18.198 --> 35:23.427
there's a place for the arms. And then he had IVs 
going in his arms. They had to be protected, and

35:29.056 --> 35:35.948
they were managed. I can remember passing him once 
and thinking, That's Jesus on the cross. That's

35:43.726 --> 35:45.929
just what it looked like. And, you know, coming 
from the Catholic tradition, I'm very familiar

35:45.949 --> 35:54.599
with crucifixes, and so many of them all look 
alike. It is a very thin, austere-looking man,

35:54.619 --> 36:10.439
often a reddish-brownish hair,

35:54.619 --> 36:10.439
and a just long, almost, is it Greco? The artist? 
Mm-hmm. who is so elongated. And he fit that

36:14.518 --> 36:16.602
picture. He could have been the model for, you 
know, the crucifix I grew up seeing in my church, my

36:16.662 --> 36:24.657
own church. And later on... you know, in the past 
recent years that I have worked through all this,

36:28.702 --> 36:37.630
you know, I came to realize, really, that was Jesus 
on the cross. That's all of it. I mean, that's the

36:39.571 --> 36:44.375
suffering Christ right here among us. He could 
have been Vietnamese. He could have been the

36:46.437 --> 36:48.259
enemy. He could have been the homeless people we 
encounter. Any of the suffering, you know, that is

36:51.521 --> 36:58.067
still happening It didn't hit me that way at the 
time, it's just it was one of those pictures that I

36:58.452 --> 37:15.404
always remembered, and I remembered what I 
associated it

36:58.452 --> 37:15.404
with at the time. Another patient I remember from 
that ward was one of the head injured. And usually

37:22.398 --> 37:33.050
those kids, even if they didn't have terrible head 
injuries, even if they had the type that they were

37:22.398 --> 37:33.050
going to recover from, they didn't wake up on the 
recovery ward. Their vital signs reached a point

37:34.051 --> 37:38.996
where they were safe to move to the ward, post-op 
ward. But they didn't wake up. We didn't have a

37:40.398 --> 37:47.946
whole lot of interaction with those patients 
because the ICU patients were too sick. And the

37:48.987 --> 37:52.371
patients coming into pre-op,

37:53.363 --> 37:55.445
They were pretty much shocked, too. We just didn't 
get to visit with them. This kid woke up very

37:58.909 --> 38:01.993
quickly. We raised the beds of those head injured 
patients as soon as it was safe to. And it was while I

38:11.143 --> 38:19.453
was raising him up to a more sitting position, he 
spoke. He said, hey, you're cute. And, you know, I

38:24.650 --> 38:27.594
laughed at him. He said,

38:27.614 --> 38:34.424
oh, my wife would kill me if she could hear me say 
that. And then he said what I heard I don't know how

38:36.126 --> 38:49.645
many times was,

38:36.126 --> 38:49.645
I haven't seen a round-eyed woman in eight

38:36.126 --> 38:49.645
months. He was wiped out on one side. It was as if he 
had had a stroke. His injury had wiped out function

38:54.411 --> 39:03.322
on

38:54.411 --> 39:03.322
one side. And he looked down at himself and he said, 
I was a steeplejack. I don't know exactly what he

39:10.071 --> 39:14.576
meant by a steeplejack, but he had been used to 
climbing around. And he knew, he knew that that was

39:14.717 --> 39:19.783
gone. I don't know. I never worked on the post-op 
neuro ward. I don't know how soon those guys talked

39:27.947 --> 39:33.355
or any of the other wards where there were really 
bad injuries. I don't know how soon they talked

39:33.375 --> 39:43.028
about, if they did talk, what had happened to them 
and what the ramifications were. This guy knew.

39:43.869 --> 39:46.733
And there he was in the recovery room recognizing 
it.

39:53.817 --> 40:12.803
What

39:53.817 --> 40:12.803
do you perceive as the differences between 
nursing in a war zone and nursing at home in 1968?

40:14.865 --> 40:23.537
Well, part of the difference was that motto I 
taught you, conserve the fighting strength. The

40:24.091 --> 40:34.882
idea in Vietnam was to get a guy, you know, patch him 
up as best you could and hopefully get him back on

40:24.091 --> 40:34.882
the battlefield. It was not necessarily to save 
his

40:34.902 --> 40:40.427
life. And that's, you know, that's what we did

40:40.447 --> 40:47.174
at home. That's nursing,

40:47.194 --> 40:53.760
medicine, that was the... That's what you always 
hoped to do.

40:59.225 --> 41:14.179
Maybe there were situations

40:59.225 --> 41:14.179
where you would stop short of that, but certainly 
not the number of times that you're ready to go and

40:59.225 --> 41:14.179
be at home.

41:19.812 --> 41:27.141
There was pretty sophisticated surgery done at an 
EVAC hospital. It was different from a surgical

41:27.382 --> 41:29.905
hospital. You know, you think of MASH. Well, that 
was a surgery hospital. It was a surgical, a mobile

41:32.689 --> 41:35.853
surgical hospital. And EVAC is where patients go 
after the surgical hospital. Now, it was

41:45.045 --> 41:49.330
different in Korea and Vietnam in that in Vietnam, 
the capacity of the choppers was so much greater

41:50.288 --> 41:55.656
than it had been. That whole medevac system had 
been refined. There were many, many choppers.

42:05.111 --> 42:06.032
People were trained. They carried medics on them. 
They didn't have just pilots. They actually had

42:12.082 --> 42:15.587
medics who could, you know, do procedures while 
they were in flight, while they were en route to the

42:16.040 --> 42:21.365
hospital. And if the chopper was closer to the back 
hospital, that's where they went. Or somebody who

42:28.552 --> 42:40.544
had a head wound, for instance, it was, you know, 
you could go fly just a little bit longer and make it

42:28.552 --> 42:40.544
to the 24th. All the head wounds, all the spinal 
cord injuries that happened in that

42:46.263 --> 43:11.410
area,

42:46.263 --> 43:11.410
in three and four core area, eventually came to our 
hospital. And, you know, distances were not

43:11.430 --> 43:12.611
terribly great, you know. It was not an initial for 
somebody to be taken directly to the 24th and back.

43:14.193 --> 43:14.633
I forgot the question. There's differences in 
nursing.

43:19.574 --> 43:36.604
there

43:19.574 --> 43:36.604
would still need to be some patients had to have

43:19.574 --> 43:36.604
different added let's say, added procedures done 
a little bit later. After having been in Nam, they

43:41.757 --> 43:52.476
might have them done in Guam or Tokyo, whereas in 
the stateside, you know, someone, an accident

43:41.757 --> 43:52.476
victim would have everything done. You know, the 
wound would be taken care of properly, completely

43:52.496 --> 44:00.330
finished, maybe, you know, with one surgery.

44:09.980 --> 44:13.625
Were you aware of any drug abuse when you were in 
Vietnam? I knew of some, but really only

44:15.668 --> 44:19.613
secondhand. I mean, I saw none. Well, no, I won't 
say I saw none. It was not the horrible problem that

44:24.300 --> 44:29.887
it became, say, a year or two years later. One of the 
corpsmen who had worked on the pre-op recovery

44:31.169 --> 44:39.160
ward I'd been getting into trouble with it. I 
really wasn't that aware of it on the ward, and I

44:44.475 --> 44:51.282
never hung around the enlisted area, living area. 
But evidently, he used up all his chances and was

44:52.102 --> 44:58.769
rotated out to the field as a medic. And there he 
continued his problem. And I remember him coming

45:02.292 --> 45:05.895
in once, coming back into the hospital. I think 
he'd come in for treatment. And he had patches on

45:09.953 --> 45:13.277
both arms inside the elbow. And I said, what 
happened? And he said he had taken frag wounds. And

45:19.684 --> 45:21.406
then he showed them to me. They weren't frag 
wounds. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

45:29.055 --> 45:35.063
I knew a nurse who was abusing Ritalin, I think. She 
was always up. She was just always

45:39.653 --> 45:51.829
up and smiling and

45:39.653 --> 45:51.829
very happy-go-lucky and working hard and this and 
that. And she came to me one night, I don't know

45:52.931 --> 46:05.548
whether she was working nights or whether she was 
just up trolling around, and asked for Ritalin.

46:05.568 --> 46:09.373
And, uh-huh, this is why you're always so up. There 
are a number of books out, a couple of them, three of

46:11.497 --> 46:22.373
them I know of, about women who've been in Vietnam. 
And one of them, they each have different stories.

46:29.584 --> 46:33.850
Each chapter is one woman's story, and they all 
include nurses. One of them is... that of a girl who

46:36.269 --> 46:41.557
was at the 24th, about 18 months after I was. And she 
talks about the drug problems being just very

46:41.577 --> 46:50.450
rampant.

46:50.470 --> 46:52.333
I think things did deteriorate. It got worse. 
Morale got

46:52.874 --> 46:58.562
worse. I knew things went on there. I had another 
corpsman who smoked pot very frequently.

47:09.158 --> 47:12.645
But it just wasn't very obvious. A lot of drinking. 
A lot of drinking. And I don't think even then I

47:16.453 --> 47:21.903
would have called that a drug problem. I do now. 
People partied hard when they got off work. And it

47:27.214 --> 47:28.737
always included drinking.
