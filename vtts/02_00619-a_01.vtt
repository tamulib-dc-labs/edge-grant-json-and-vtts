WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:04.845
I'm awfully tired. Last week, I went to a meeting, 
and we started at 9 in the morning, went right

00:05.246 --> 00:11.941
through the noon hour until 11 o'clock at night, 
five minutes. And I'm pretty pooped out, so if I'm

00:11.961 --> 00:14.546
shaky, you'll know it's me. Oh, that's all right. 
Maybe I'll catch you off guard or something. Yeah,

00:17.894 --> 00:18.595
okay. Explain to me how your interest developed in 
the oceans. During World War II, I was a

00:22.660 --> 00:34.813
meteorologist in the Navy, and purely by chance, I 
was sent to Scripps Institution of Oceanography

00:22.660 --> 00:34.813
to learn how to forecast sea and swell for the then 
coming Japanese invasion. and I was stationed in

00:36.059 --> 00:38.342
New Caledonia. Two of us were to be sent to the 
Philippines to set up a new weather center there,

00:38.382 --> 00:48.634
and one was to come back to Scripps, and we drew 
names out of a hat, and that's how I got into

00:38.382 --> 00:48.634
oceanography. And came back to Scripps. Right. 
Where's your hometown? Where were you from? My

00:51.678 --> 00:54.021
hometown, actually, I was born in South Dakota. I 
lived for short periods of time in Montana and

00:54.041 --> 01:01.010
Astoria and Carleton, but I grew up in Newburgh, 
Oregon, about 40 miles north of here. And what did

01:02.111 --> 01:03.252
your parents do? My father was a printer and a 
beekeeper. It was quite a combination. And so you

01:07.995 --> 01:11.521
didn't go to school here at Oregon, did you? I went 
to school at George Fox College, which was then

01:11.541 --> 01:17.171
called Pacific College, and it happened to be in 
the town that I grew up in. It was a Quaker college.

01:19.976 --> 01:24.544
And was there even a major in meteorology per se? 
No, I got the meteorology after the war started. I

01:28.181 --> 01:31.526
joined the Navy and was sent to the postgraduate 
school in Annapolis. That's where you became a

01:32.488 --> 01:34.550
meteorologist. Right. There seems to be a goodly 
number of meteorologists, if I may use this word,

01:35.412 --> 01:41.320
who end up in oceanography about this time. 
Spellhouse, for example, comes through the

01:41.380 --> 01:46.347
School of the Air Force and ends up in directing 
towards oceanography? Does there seem to be a

01:48.084 --> 01:51.878
particular kinship towards meteorology and 
oceanography? Well, I think the reason for this

01:52.179 --> 01:58.783
was that there were a lot of meteorologists 
trained, and when they got out after the war, there

01:52.179 --> 01:58.783
was nothing for them to do. I know that I hadn't 
planned on going to Scripps, and I wrote a letter to

01:58.932 --> 02:07.420
Dr. Carl Rosby at Chicago and asked him what I could 
do with my meteorology. He said, well, they're

02:07.440 --> 02:09.061
starting a class at Scripps. Why don't I go down 
there? And the class was in oceanography? It was

02:12.244 --> 02:17.549
the first class that was set up in oceanography, 
and almost everyone was a meteorologist that was

02:12.244 --> 02:17.549
in the class. Who was in that class with you? Oh, I 
never can remember them all. Bob Reed, John

02:22.694 --> 02:27.859
Cochran from Texas A&M, Dale Leaper, William 
Cameron, I'd have to look up the group. Sure, I

02:33.572 --> 02:34.533
know. The only point of that question is that right 
at Scripps, right at this time right after the war,

02:34.754 --> 02:49.195
there seems to be a tremendous surge of 
intellectual interest in oceanography, and a

02:34.754 --> 02:49.195
goodly number of really first-rate 
oceanographers appear. Do you have any

02:49.736 --> 02:51.559
particular explanation for that? Well, I think 
during World War II we found out that that we really

02:55.075 --> 03:00.883
didn't know much about sound transmission in the 
ocean or about sea and swell, any of these things

02:55.075 --> 03:00.883
that the Navy needed to know. And Dr. Sferdip then, 
right after the war, set up this class in which he

03:01.223 --> 03:08.594
invited 15, selected 15 people to come into this 
class. And it just was a step in function. OK. And

03:11.598 --> 03:18.026
while you were there at Scripps, I think this is 46, 
is it not? This was in September of 1946. Yeah, OK.

03:20.810 --> 03:24.255
Now, while you were there in 46, I assume that at 
least that you were following a graduate degree in

03:26.007 --> 03:35.359
oceanography to lead towards a Ph.D. Is this 
correct? This is right. We all enrolled for

03:36.260 --> 03:38.644
master's degrees. We all had bachelor's degrees 
plus some advanced training in meteorology. So we

03:42.669 --> 03:53.483
minored in meteorology at UCLA and used our 
credits that we'd gotten in the various service

03:42.669 --> 03:53.483
schools and all of our group majored in physical 
oceanography. So we were all somewhat

03:53.902 --> 03:56.385
homogeneous in our training. And what did you work 
on between, let's say, 46, 47, and 48? Were you

04:03.915 --> 04:06.599
directed already towards a particular research 
topic? We all had jobs at Scripps. We were all

04:09.222 --> 04:11.285
graduate research assistants. And I was in charge 
of the Navy processing section for

04:11.325 --> 04:17.673
bathothermographs for the Pacific Ocean. And I 
had about five or six people working for me. And I

04:19.816 --> 04:21.478
worked at that until I left. Okay. You should have 
known about the BT already pretty well. Didn't you

04:24.883 --> 04:26.165
use it in meteorology? No. I'd never heard of it 
until I got the experience. Never heard of it. It

04:30.031 --> 04:31.233
was invented during the war. I'd never heard of 
oceanography before I went down there. Okay. It's

04:36.981 --> 04:38.303
something entirely new to me. So this was indeed a 
deep ocean movie. Well, from a guy from the Dakotas

04:40.265 --> 04:46.474
and then Oregon, I suspect at least Southern 
California had been a little different. Right. It

04:47.376 --> 04:48.377
was quite different. Were you already married 
then? Yes, I was married before the war. Okay. So

04:53.429 --> 04:59.637
then the point is you're already a mature student 
then, anxious to... Yes, I was in my late 20s at that

04:59.657 --> 05:01.800
time. Most of us, there were one or two fellows that 
had gotten into meteorology right out of college,

05:02.441 --> 05:08.990
but most of us were in our late 20s. And what was your 
master's degree problem, if I may ask? At that

05:15.070 --> 05:19.334
time, we had so much coursework to do that they 
didn't require a problem. So each one of us got a

05:19.394 --> 05:22.036
master's degree just with coursework. OK. And 
then you go on to work towards a PhD? Right. And I did

05:26.400 --> 05:29.422
my PhD in light scattering and turbid waters.

05:32.185 --> 05:33.066
And with whom did you work? I started out under and 
he left right about the middle of my graduate

05:34.267 --> 05:39.231
career. And then I finished up with Carl Eckert.

05:44.652 --> 05:50.419
If it's fair to say, what oceanographers had an 
impact upon you that helped to direct your career?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.121
Anyone you'd like to name by name? Well, I think Dr. 
Spurduck had the greatest effect. Most people

05:55.846 --> 06:05.759
don't realize or haven't heard that Spurduck was 
well-known in his own country as a sociologist and

05:55.846 --> 06:05.759
writer on things that had to do with other than 
science. He was a very, very fine person. What was

06:09.444 --> 06:10.024
he like? Well, he was kind of down to earth. He came 
from a family of preachers and Arctic explorers,

06:14.318 --> 06:19.584
which is, again, quite a combination. And well, he 
just knew people, liked people, and was just

06:20.565 --> 06:29.435
inspirational, if I can use that term. And then is 
he whom you think helps to direct your early work

06:29.455 --> 06:35.141
towards light scattering? No, I'm not sure just 
how I got into light scattering.

06:42.162 --> 06:54.200
I had not started to work on my thesis until after 
he'd gone, and I was pretty well into life

06:42.162 --> 06:54.200
scattering before I went to Carl Eckert and asked 
him if he would be my thesis director. So I really

06:55.462 --> 06:57.605
did it all on my own. Okay. Well, it seems many 
people have commented how close-knit the early

06:59.167 --> 07:08.862
community was at Scripps at this time, and how 
they've become unhappier as graduate schools

06:59.167 --> 07:08.862
have become fragmented. But yet your experience 
would seem to indicate that you were pretty well

07:09.533 --> 07:13.419
left on your own at Scripps. Is that the wrong 
inference to draw? I think Scripps has a tendency

07:17.085 --> 07:22.413
to let people do, to work on their own if they'll do 
it. This was my impression at any rate. And you

07:28.702 --> 07:31.687
leave Scripps to go to Johns Hopkins, is that 
correct? Right, I left Scripps in 1948 with Don

07:31.707 --> 07:36.975
Pritchard to start the Chesapeake Bay Institute 
at Johns Hopkins. And what were to be the goals of

07:37.192 --> 07:41.018
the Chesapeake Bay Institute, which you ended up 
directing? No, I never was director. I was

07:43.041 --> 07:43.802
associate director. Associate, okay, I'm sorry. 
Or assistant director, I've forgotten which.

07:48.930 --> 07:54.379
Well, Chesapeake Bay is extremely important as a 
source of seafood. There were a lot of problems

07:55.200 --> 08:01.630
associated with pollution, freshwater inflow 
that affected the... fish and shellfish that were

08:02.993 --> 08:11.986
taken out of the bay, and the idea was that the 
states of Maryland and Virginia and the U.S. Navy

08:02.993 --> 08:11.986
would together set up this institute. The Navy's 
primary interest, I think, was to have a teaching

08:12.006 --> 08:23.803
organization close by so that people who were 
working in oceanography in Washington could get

08:12.006 --> 08:23.803
formal training at Johns Hopkins. How many of you 
were first there? How large was the faculty? I

08:28.863 --> 08:31.908
think we started off, I was the first one to come. 
Don Pritchard came second as director, and then we

08:31.988 --> 08:39.719
had about three others by the time I left in 1953.

08:41.742 --> 08:46.129
And what did you do and why did you leave? Well, I'd 
always wanted to get back to Oregon. And I'd been

08:51.254 --> 08:55.659
writing letters here trying to get something 
going and hadn't really had much success. So I made

08:56.540 --> 09:06.832
a trip out and talked to the dean of the School of 
Science at Oregon State and said, if I can bring my

08:56.540 --> 09:06.832
own contract and pay my salary, can I come and start 
an oceanography set up at Oregon State? He says,

09:06.852 --> 09:08.814
fine. And the Navy was good enough to give me a small 
contract to get started in 1954. But 53, 54, you

09:13.902 --> 09:16.706
were at the University of Washington, weren't 
you? This is right. I sort of had to get closer to

09:19.149 --> 09:23.896
Oregon State to get the thing started, and this is 
why I took a year's job there. Okay, and I take it you

09:24.216 --> 09:26.480
worked there with Fleming then? I worked with 
Fleming, and mainly with Dr. Barnes. Okay. He was

09:33.189 --> 09:35.432
the principal physical oceanographer then. And 
what sort of work did you do? that year at

09:40.801 --> 09:41.903
Washington? What's our research work? The Navy 
had asked me if I would try to

09:42.904 --> 09:57.885
get some of the data that they had been collecting 
there over a period of years in a shape so that it

09:42.904 --> 09:57.885
could be used, published in effect. So I spent most 
of the time editing data and getting out data

09:57.925 --> 10:03.553
reports of one kind or another. Now, this is, I'm 
really breaking away from the chronology, but I

10:03.573 --> 10:07.619
want to do it right here anyway. The I take it most of 
the work you do with the Navy is through ONR. Yes,

10:14.322 --> 10:18.509
we've never had any contracts that I know of that 
weren't through ONR. Okay. See, ONR started about

10:18.869 --> 10:21.974
30 years ago, just about the time I started out. 
Right, now that's exactly what I want to ask you

10:22.034 --> 10:24.338
about. What were your first contacts with ONR? It 
begins right at the end of the war. Well, I was in

10:30.027 --> 10:36.897
charge of the bath thermograph section, which 
actually was supported by some other section in

10:30.027 --> 10:36.897
the Navy, and then... I think I had my first contact 
with ONR when I went back to Johns Hopkins in 1948,

10:37.248 --> 10:46.729
and as I said before, they supported a third of 
Chesapeake Bay Institute when it started up.

10:46.849 --> 10:50.417
Okay, and with whom did you work in the ONR office? 
Gordon Lill was the first person, and he was there

10:50.698 --> 10:54.867
for a number of years. Okay. So you really then 
arrive at ONR after Revell has left, I suppose.

11:00.624 --> 11:01.606
This is right. Okay, now, when Lill tried to fund 
research, did it seem very mission-oriented

11:01.626 --> 11:09.777
then, or did it seem pretty open, deep-water 
research? Were research grants difficult to get?

11:13.362 --> 11:15.044
Were they giving block research grants? Did you 
have pretty well control of your own money? Well,

11:17.056 --> 11:24.327
at that time, we had pretty well had control of our 
own money, but we were given block grants, in

11:17.056 --> 11:24.327
effect. They were fairly small. My first grant 
here was for $10,000, which took care of my salary

11:25.408 --> 11:32.679
and all the assistance I had and everything. And it 
stayed that for about five or six years. So the

11:34.923 --> 11:39.610
grants weren't very big, but they were not 
necessarily mission-oriented. As long as it was

11:39.670 --> 11:41.853
good science, that was all I required. Okay. There 
seems to have been a change in that lately now, ever

11:42.514 --> 11:46.540
since... Oh, really, the Nixon administration, I 
suppose. Well, Mansfield had an amendment to some

11:50.243 --> 12:03.878
bill in which he directed that the research 
supported by the Defense Department be more

11:50.243 --> 12:03.878
mission-oriented, and then things changed about 
that. Okay. Do you think this was a mistake? I

12:08.683 --> 12:10.966
haven't really thought too much about it. It's 
been harder to work under the present rules than

12:10.986 --> 12:15.531
the past rules, but I think that... We really 
haven't had any great trouble with ONR. So when you

12:20.755 --> 12:28.686
come to Oregon State, then from Washington, you 
come in effect to almost the founder department,

12:20.755 --> 12:28.686
by the way, is what they keep telling me at 
Washington. What did you have in mind when you came

12:29.247 --> 12:31.270
here? I'm not a planner. Okay. I just thought that I 
could start a program and make it grow, and I spun my

12:36.898 --> 12:44.269
wheels for about five years until 19... 58 or 59 and 
then things started to happen and I had done some

12:44.823 --> 12:56.137
planning during this period and the department 
was set up in 1959 and then grew very rapidly. Okay.

12:57.759 --> 13:01.785
Between 55 and 59 what did you primarily work on? 
Well, I had a 14-foot skiff and a 15-horsepower

13:01.805 --> 13:09.594
outboard and I'd go up and down the coast and work in 
the estuaries. I published several papers on the,

13:10.035 --> 13:13.159
on Oregon estuaries And then the Coast Guard had a 
40-footer that operated out of Newport, and I

13:14.557 --> 13:24.869
persuaded them to go out on a 25-mile line once a 
month, and we'd go out and do a hydrographic

13:14.557 --> 13:24.869
section. This started about 1955, I think. So it 
was a pretty minimal operation. Did you have any

13:33.118 --> 13:34.379
students working with you? My first student 
was... Well, I had two students in those days. One

13:39.145 --> 13:42.268
was Bruce McAllister, and the other one was... 
named Calloway. I think Calloway got his degree

13:43.393 --> 13:47.099
first, a master's degree, and Bruce got his a 
little bit later. These were before we had the

13:48.742 --> 13:50.304
department. I was in the Department of General 
Science. Okay, well that answers the next

13:51.847 --> 13:53.610
question. I wonder what department you worked out 
of. Right. Now then, when you began to plan to

13:55.673 --> 13:59.399
create a department itself, how did you go about 
it? Whom did you talk to? Well, the department

14:01.843 --> 14:04.186
actually came in a hurry. Gordon Lill had put 
$250,000 in the Navy's 10-year plan called Tenoc.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.182
This would have been about 1958. This $250,000 was 
to build a boat or a ship for Oregon State, but

14:16.583 --> 14:24.638
nothing came of it for a year or so. I was down in San 
Diego chairmening a meeting of the western

14:26.000 --> 14:33.754
section of the American Society of Limnology and 
Oceanography, and I got a telephone call. and this

14:34.342 --> 14:39.559
was on a Thursday, I think, and Lil said, this was in 
June, I have $250,000. If you can have a proposal in

14:39.880 --> 14:43.612
here by Monday, I'll give it to you to build your 
boat. I didn't even go back to the meeting. I just

14:45.538 --> 14:47.946
went to the airport and took off. And as soon as I 
knew I was going to get the $250,000, I went and

14:49.310 --> 14:55.821
talked to the president and said, look, I think 
this is a real propitious time. If you could set up a

14:55.841 --> 15:07.200
department out of whole cloths, so to speak, I 
think that we could really make this go, because

14:55.841 --> 15:07.200
the Navy isn't going to give me $250,000 without 
giving me money to run the boat, and this will

14:55.841 --> 15:07.200
require other researchers to keep it busy. And the 
president said, fine. So I think it was the only

15:10.883 --> 15:15.468
time a department was set up with one person that 
I've ever heard of. OK. Now, you were chairman of

15:16.829 --> 15:19.552
the department from 59 to 67, right? Right. During 
this period of time also, you talk about Marine

15:22.115 --> 15:27.481
Science Center in Newport, Oregon. Right. Now, 
what is that? We needed a place to dock our vessels.

15:35.566 --> 15:37.409
These are vessels that were going to come in the 
future. We had the Akona at that time. This is the

15:39.252 --> 15:40.855
one we built with the 250,000. And

15:41.035 --> 15:51.192
I got to talking to several people in Newport about 
the possibility of setting up a lab there. And one

15:51.753 --> 15:53.856
or two fellows said, well, fine. The port has got 
some nice land on the other side of the river. We can

15:58.362 --> 15:59.504
get a lease for you. So we began talking. And pretty 
soon, they gave us a lease for 49 acres. And I put a

16:06.056 --> 16:08.781
proposal into NSF to build a building. And while 
this was still pending, they had several site

16:09.483 --> 16:12.608
visits on it. And I thought I had a fairly good 
chance of putting up a small building. The Area

16:16.395 --> 16:19.982
Redevelopment Administration came to my 
attention. Newport was a very depressed area, and

16:21.616 --> 16:27.686
they were trying to figure out some way to get some 
more jobs in the community. So I came up with the

16:28.367 --> 16:36.441
idea of building a Marine Science Center and said 
that, well, I can get 60 or 70 jobs, and this might be

16:28.367 --> 16:36.441
a good thing to do. And it took some politicking, 
but eventually most of the people in town got

16:38.745 --> 16:46.037
behind it, and we put in a proposal for $900,000. 
90,000, sort of a JCPenney amount, just below a

16:46.709 --> 16:51.955
million dollars, and it went right through. 
Excellent. With whom did you work in the area of

16:52.916 --> 17:00.365
redevelopment? I've forgotten the name of the 
fellow. He was in Portland. The main reason it went

17:02.728 --> 17:13.120
through was that I knew a lot of people in 
Washington that were interested in what I was

17:02.728 --> 17:13.120
doing, backing me to some extent. In particular, 
John Lyman was one of the best ones. So I got each one

17:16.325 --> 17:20.631
of these people to make a pitch to the area 
redevelopment in Washington. And I think somehow

17:21.112 --> 17:25.679
they were convinced, and they went along with it. 
It's interesting that practically everybody

17:25.699 --> 17:31.247
else in the country then tried to get some funds, 
and the door was closed, and nobody else got them.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.229
Nobody else got them built. Maybe they didn't have 
John Lyman to make the pitch. John Lyman did a good

17:35.193 --> 17:36.375
job. So then you're, in effect, wearing two hats in 
this period. One is that you're chairman of the

17:41.806 --> 17:43.288
department. The other is you're trying to found in 
this marine research center. Right. While

17:48.933 --> 17:51.976
chairman of the department, how did you try to 
direct the department? What kind of people did you

17:51.996 --> 17:53.958
try to bring into it? How did you see Oregon State's 
future in oceanography, if I may use those words?

17:59.364 --> 18:02.367
Well, at the start, it was rather difficult 
because we didn't have anything. We were 100%

18:02.867 --> 18:06.531
almost, yeah, we were 100% on grants. And it was 
difficult to get the first one or two people, and

18:06.967 --> 18:12.815
they had to be sort of adventuresome and people 
that would come. And Dr. Herbert Ferlander was the

18:13.816 --> 18:16.680
first one. I think the reason he came was he was 
passed over. Promotion was a little bit peeved at

18:19.905 --> 18:24.451
the University of Washington, and so he came. I 
think I was just plain lucky in getting good

18:25.753 --> 18:31.862
people. I didn't really have any criteria other 
than people that I thought would get along with

18:31.902 --> 18:36.568
each other and work as a team. And then you expected 
these people to bring in enough grant money to

18:37.662 --> 18:42.749
support themselves. This is the way we had to start 
out, yes. And soon after we had the department set

18:45.333 --> 18:50.981
up, then we got one or two positions from the 
university. And this grew until now. I think we

18:52.103 --> 18:56.569
have about 11 positions paid by the university out 
of 60 PhDs. So it's still only a small percentage.

18:59.273 --> 19:02.117
It seemed to me when I checked, you're about 10% 
state funded. I don't think we've ever been as high

19:02.266 --> 19:05.131
as ten percent. More like six or seven. So almost 
immediately then Oregon State has to support

19:08.616 --> 19:15.187
itself and bring people in from grants. What sort 
of proposals did you offer? Did it seem to be some

19:17.551 --> 19:21.097
sort of a unique advantage you had here at Oregon 
State? Work off the Oregon coast, for example? The

19:27.005 --> 19:28.968
research business is like any other business. 
It's like a factory. If you can get something

19:31.010 --> 19:34.915
coming out the other end and sell it, then you can 
grow. So that our whole pitch was to get results as

19:35.916 --> 19:42.325
quickly as we could and do good research and keep it 
going. And it's very highly competitive.

19:48.573 --> 19:50.455
If you produce, you get paid. If you don't produce, 
you fall apart. And so that was then the basis, that

19:53.971 --> 19:56.776
was the pressure you worked under? Yeah. What 
about in terms of undergraduate instruction? Did

20:01.063 --> 20:05.470
you try to expand into a general degree in 
oceanography? No, I've always felt that a person

20:06.833 --> 20:18.392
needed to be a good, to have a good training in one of 
the basic sciences before they could go on and

20:06.833 --> 20:18.392
apply this to the oceans.

20:19.047 --> 20:22.212
While we've taught a lot of undergraduate 
students, we've never had a degree. We presently

20:22.833 --> 20:28.221
teach something like 600 different students take 
undergraduate classes. Now then, you subscribe

20:29.262 --> 20:41.280
to the concept that someone should take a degree in 
the hard sciences and then go on to a degree in

20:29.262 --> 20:41.280
oceanography. They want an advanced degree in 
oceanography. What sort of hard science degrees

20:44.726 --> 20:47.670
do you prefer for them to take? Well, we have five 
different divisions, and in each one they have a

20:48.477 --> 20:53.241
different selection. In physical oceanography, 
it's either math or physics or a combination of

20:53.482 --> 20:56.845
these two. In geology, geological oceanography, 
it's geology. Biological oceanography,

21:00.788 --> 21:02.550
biology. Chemical oceanography, chemistry, and 
so on. There seems to be a goodly number of

21:05.733 --> 21:14.781
complaints I've heard recently, though, about 
the failure of mathematical training of the

21:05.733 --> 21:14.781
people who are coming into oceanography. They say 
it feels as if... the undergraduate students

21:16.203 --> 21:18.626
should take more mathematics. Would you agree 
with that? Well, I'm sure that there are problems

21:21.290 --> 21:24.534
with mathematical training. However, it seems as 
though we have a good enough selection of students

21:24.574 --> 21:30.882
that we really haven't had much trouble with. Most 
of them have their math. Very good. There also

21:32.885 --> 21:40.995
seems to be some complaint among your colleagues 
that the world of the general oceanographer seems

21:32.885 --> 21:40.995
to be collapsing. that if someone like yourself 
who came from urology into physical oceanography

21:41.330 --> 21:51.602
into other research, that these people are not 
developed anymore because the field is too

21:41.330 --> 21:51.602
specialized. I have a feeling of sadness because 
this is true. Last week I went to a meeting at

21:56.587 --> 22:07.740
Scripps in which there were about 50 
theoreticians and four or five people that did

21:56.587 --> 22:07.740
field work, and I felt a terrible imbalance there. 
Now, it... That's also another complaint, is

22:12.160 --> 22:20.430
oceanographers no longer get their feet wet, that 
the computers have eliminated people going out on

22:12.160 --> 22:20.430
ships as much as they should. Would you agree with 
that? Yes, I agree with that. I believe if you're an

22:22.913 --> 22:24.875
oceanographer, you ought to go to sea. In the 
field, you ought to go to sea. Or take the models

22:27.118 --> 22:30.662
you're building and test them out in the field 
itself? Well, if possible. I realize that a person

22:32.044 --> 22:38.832
can't be everything, but I think that some of the 
theoreticians are too far removed from the

22:32.044 --> 22:38.832
applied science. From the sea life, all right. For 
example, I try to go to sea at least a month every

22:43.312 --> 22:50.523
year and average that, and have for years. That's 
good. Then you leave the chairmanship of the

22:53.067 --> 22:59.356
department, what, in 67, is that correct? 66 or 67. 
All right, and then you become associate dean of

23:00.198 --> 23:02.982
oceanography. I became associate dean of 
research. Research, I'm sorry. Yeah, for the

23:07.529 --> 23:11.715
university, with oceanography as my specialty. 
If you can turn that off for a minute, I'll tell you

23:12.556 --> 23:14.338
why. OK.

23:23.150 --> 23:37.028
Looking back over this first part of your career, 
as you've sketched it in effect roughly, Scripps,

23:23.150 --> 23:37.028
then out to Chesapeake Bay, then as chairman of the 
department, and then as a dean for research, would

23:23.150 --> 23:37.028
you change anything? Oh, goodness. I'm sure that 
if a person thought about it, he might try to change

23:40.739 --> 23:49.568
something, but I don't look back very often.

23:49.588 --> 23:51.509
I think that I've been extremely fortunate. I've 
had a lot of good luck. In what way? Well, breaks.

24:01.699 --> 24:02.640
There are three ingredients. You try to select 
good people, you work your tail off, and you have

24:02.660 --> 24:05.983
good luck. I think you make your own luck part of 
that. Okay. Now, in this period, as you're sort of

24:10.690 --> 24:23.335
going upward, are there any of your colleagues you 
would like to mention as people who had sizable

24:10.690 --> 24:23.335
effects upon you as you shaped your career along 
the way?

24:28.505 --> 24:30.589
Well, I think the early staff that we had helped a 
good deal. We started out with Dr. Frolander and

24:32.880 --> 24:38.506
Dr. Byrne, Dr. Petullo. Each one of these people 
were very fine people, hardworking, liked

24:38.526 --> 24:43.793
people, were good with students. And I think that I 
was just extremely fortunate to have that team to

24:43.913 --> 24:48.899
start off with, because I didn't have to worry 
about any of them. They did their work. They

24:50.361 --> 24:50.781
helped. And the next layer were Bill Piercy, Larry 
Small, Vern Combe. They were all exactly the same

24:58.451 --> 25:00.373
way. I didn't have any troublemakers or anybody 
trying to pull a place apart, and I think that was

25:01.585 --> 25:10.953
pretty good. Now, I just have two or three more 
questions about administration, and then I want

25:11.534 --> 25:16.518
to go back to your academic career. It's almost as 
if ONR deliberately tried to establish

25:17.759 --> 25:30.951
departments of oceanography in the 50s and 60s, 
beginning about 57 with IGY. Are there too many

25:31.859 --> 25:34.341
departments of oceanography now? Well, there are 
about roughly 15 first-line departments, and I

25:36.143 --> 25:41.228
think that's enough. I don't mean to be selfish, 
but it takes a certain critical mass to run an

25:41.248 --> 25:47.073
oceanographic organization. You have to have a 
ship that costs you a million dollars a year to

25:47.093 --> 25:55.761
operate, and I believe that perhaps 15 for the 
country is enough. And the lid was sort of placed

25:56.181 --> 25:59.284
on... further growth by NSF some years ago by not 
supporting new outfits with facilities that they

25:59.872 --> 26:05.739
needed. Several states have had powerful enough 
support from within the state to break this form,

26:06.960 --> 26:21.618
or whatever you want to call it, and there have been 
several states that have started up programs

26:06.960 --> 26:21.618
since the lid was sort of placed on it, but not very 
many. Delaware, for example, and North Carolina

26:21.638 --> 26:25.963
were too.

26:29.065 --> 26:37.493
In accumulating this funding for your 
university, were you happy to see the division

26:29.065 --> 26:37.493
between ONR and NSF? Did that seem to you to be 
essentially a good thing? I think it's an

26:39.676 --> 26:42.038
extremely good thing. I think you need sort of 
checks and balances. If we only had one

26:46.242 --> 26:57.233
organization to go to, out of 25 or 50 
administrators that would have something to do

26:46.242 --> 26:57.233
with that organization, there'd be a few that 
weren't really very good. And you might run into a

26:58.057 --> 27:03.002
situation where you just couldn't move if you just 
had one person that you were dealing with. This way

27:03.022 --> 27:07.106
you can work with both, and I think this is very 
healthy. All right, so I take it then that you would

27:07.126 --> 27:17.576
be opposed, to answer your question earlier, you 
would be opposed towards the move, which seems to

27:07.126 --> 27:17.576
be developing, about a super organization. I'm 
dead set against it. I always have been. Okay, so

27:20.519 --> 27:23.862
you think that, in this case, diversity of 
organizations is better. Well, I think so as far as

27:24.803 --> 27:28.430
support of contract and grant research. For 
example, we've had NOAA for a number of years. And

27:31.957 --> 27:38.290
NOAA has been advised time and again by various 
advisory groups and people that they'd ought to

27:38.422 --> 27:40.886
have better rapport with the universities. 
They'd ought to do some granting within

27:40.926 --> 27:43.109
universities. And aside from Sea Grant, which was 
given to them as a whole package, they really

27:43.229 --> 27:48.857
haven't done anything. And I'm afraid if we had a 
super organization that the money would be

27:49.258 --> 27:57.630
channeled into the organization and the funds 
outside would tend to dry up. That would be, you're

27:57.650 --> 28:00.174
talking about primarily in-house research. 
Right, right. What's wrong with in-house

28:01.576 --> 28:02.978
research? Guys in NOAA say it's very efficient. 
There are all kinds of opinions on this. I happen to

28:09.926 --> 28:14.493
believe that it's much cheaper and more efficient 
to do it in universities. By contract. Some of your

28:15.575 --> 28:21.143
colleagues maintain that the problem with 
in-house research is you get in-house proposal

28:15.575 --> 28:21.143
reviews. This is correct, to some degree. And they 
dislike that idea. We have to be on our toes. Every

28:28.474 --> 28:36.306
single grant or every single proposal we put in 
gets a thorough working over, and we have to

28:28.474 --> 28:36.306
satisfy our peers. or we can't be funded. I don't 
think this is true to this extent in your house.

28:43.443 --> 28:51.872
Also, it has been suggested that one of the 
problems with the new grant-giving techniques is

28:43.443 --> 28:51.872
you almost have to come with a specialized grant. 
You expect them to look it over the grant, and then

28:52.893 --> 28:59.941
the grant's very limited, and that limits freedom 
of research. Now, that's a very poorly put

29:00.001 --> 29:05.567
question, but there was a time when you had a 
blanket amount of money to run a show. you could say

29:06.458 --> 29:30.711
i want to go out for two or three days and try this out 
and then if it worked then you could take that data

29:06.458 --> 29:30.711
and make a solid proposal if it didn't well you just 
took that two or three day loss well i think there's

29:06.458 --> 29:30.711
a tendency in the direction that you're pointing 
however i have found that if i'm perfectly honest

29:06.458 --> 29:30.711
with onr and want to try something a little bit 
different than i put in my proposal i they've never

29:06.458 --> 29:30.711
objected They've been extremely good and free to 
allow me to make minor changes and to do some

29:32.345 --> 29:39.642
exploratory work. And this is just really the last 
question about that, but I take it you've been

29:39.662 --> 29:46.077
quite happy in terms of contract work with the 
government. You feel like you've had what we call

29:46.318 --> 29:50.708
loosely academic freedom and all this kind of 
thing. I don't have anything to complain about at

29:51.177 --> 29:53.241
all. Individually, occasionally, I'll put a 
proposal in, and I'll get some bad reviews and

29:53.281 --> 30:03.803
won't get it, and this makes me a little bit angry, 
but I think the system is about as good as you can

29:53.281 --> 30:03.803
develop it.
