WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:27.186
convinced they made this one out of the battleship 
arizona all right

00:02.309 --> 00:27.186
now uh in addition to the italians not being too 
concerned about about the impact of of their

00:02.309 --> 00:27.186
civilization on the environment are there any 
other particular european countries which uh

00:02.309 --> 00:27.186
seem to have a like attitude well when you get up 
into the baltic

00:29.984 --> 00:36.674
you find a situation which, in my opinion, 
represents almost the end of the curve. That whole

00:37.835 --> 00:59.907
industrial area along the Baltic, which includes 
both Germany's Soviet Union, the Scandinavian

00:37.835 --> 00:59.907
countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, they've 
been dumping just about everything into the

00:37.835 --> 00:59.907
rivers farther up that comes down and dumps into 
either the Baltic or the North Sea. And if you look

01:00.275 --> 01:06.582
at some of the rivers there as they enter the seas, 
they defy the imagination. If we think we have

01:07.624 --> 01:10.427
polluted rivers, we ain't seen nothing. And the 
public is beginning to get concerned. There's a

01:15.333 --> 01:29.910
situation in Sweden, for example, where the 
fallout from sulfites

01:15.333 --> 01:29.910
in the atmosphere has reduced the pH acidity of the 
Swedish lake Many of the very productive fishing

01:31.257 --> 01:36.867
lakes are now completely destroyed. And, of 
course, they blame it on their neighbors to the

01:37.908 --> 01:41.915
south, which is where it's coming from. But it's so 
complicated with so many different countries

01:42.757 --> 01:54.497
living so closely together as to who to blame what, 
and there's not much point in one country trying to

01:42.757 --> 01:54.497
clean up the river at its... if the country 
upstream is going to continue to pollute it. So

02:00.615 --> 02:04.140
it's a far more complicated situation than we have 
here. A lot of laymen are concerned about it, but

02:04.761 --> 02:17.438
they don't have the machinery or the platform from 
which to work that we do in this country to get the

02:04.761 --> 02:17.438
government to do something. Okay, I only have one 
more question about the environment and your work

02:17.458 --> 02:22.225
in environmentalism. And that is, is there any 
hope for environmentalism in underdeveloped

02:25.139 --> 02:27.602
countries at all? Yes, and it's for that reason 
that we are involved right now in the planning of an

02:29.044 --> 02:47.670
international workshop in Brazil next year to try 
to bring to their attention, at their request

02:29.044 --> 02:47.670
pretty much, The problems involved with planning 
and pollution and biological productivity in

02:49.237 --> 02:57.189
coastal environments and estuarine 
environments. Many of the government officials

02:57.610 --> 03:13.995
in a state like Bahia, the governor of which 
incidentally is a graduate of the medical school

02:57.610 --> 03:13.995
of Cornell and extremely knowledgeable and 
extremely concerned about the collision course

02:57.610 --> 03:13.995
that Bahia is on, in reference to tourism, 
petrochemical industries, and fisheries. He

03:19.173 --> 03:29.085
sees that they cannot develop all three without 
considering the weaknesses and liabilities of

03:19.173 --> 03:29.085
each one of them. And we want to join with them and 
people from all over Latin America and hopefully

03:30.146 --> 03:39.156
Europe to talk about the things that we have done, 
the mistakes that we have made, we might do if we

03:39.710 --> 03:49.743
were going to do it again and hopefully catch them 
early enough on the slope of their curve that they

03:39.710 --> 03:49.743
can do some of the things within reason. Now you're 
not going to, I'm not going to expect them to do much

03:49.804 --> 04:03.642
to retard the development of the petrochemical 
complex down there which is a multi-billion

03:49.804 --> 04:03.642
dollar program in the interest of a few fish. But I 
think the fact that they are even concerned about

04:05.377 --> 04:09.082
it is rewarding. And most of the younger staff 
within the planning division, which is sort of

04:09.142 --> 04:16.954
like our EPA, are educated in this country or 
Europe. And they're knowledgeable. And they just

04:18.857 --> 04:25.106
need some guidance and some examples of things to 
help them develop their own program. Other

04:25.867 --> 04:26.788
countries, no. But a lot of Latin American 
countries are really concerned. that they're

04:31.718 --> 04:36.244
going to wreck what they've got before they ever 
really begin to enjoy it. Now I have a series of

04:38.046 --> 04:41.471
questions which may or may not be true. These are 
simply things I don't know. Did you ever study at

04:43.273 --> 04:46.597
Scripps Institution of Oceanography? No. Did you 
do work out there as a research associate? No. I

04:51.744 --> 04:55.849
visited there once as a member of the Ocean 
Sciences Board of the National Academy of

04:51.744 --> 04:55.849
Sciences. That's all. Why has so much of your 
larval development and growth research been done

04:59.613 --> 05:04.903
on the barnacle?

05:08.329 --> 05:10.694
Well, I wouldn't say it has been. I might have 
agreed with that 10 years ago. But since then,

05:15.202 --> 05:20.613
we've taken a lot of the techniques that we 
developed for barnacles and expanded it in other

05:15.202 --> 05:20.613
ways. And which ways have you expanded? Primarily 
into the decapod crustaceans, the crabs and the

05:25.162 --> 05:34.197
shrimps, but some into polychaetes and some other 
crustaceans. Okay, now, when I went back and read

05:34.217 --> 05:46.978
your articles, it seemed to me that the move to the 
crab, the significant move to the crab, came in 65

05:34.217 --> 05:46.978
and 66. Would you disagree with that? No, it was a 
little earlier. Okay. About 60, actually. Okay,

05:52.145 --> 05:58.774
well, the first time I begin to see a goodly number 
of publications appear is the middle 60s. Yeah,

05:59.054 --> 06:04.923
well, by that time, the numbers, and that tied in 
with O&R London, just as a side here. I was invited

06:04.943 --> 06:15.457
to go to O&R London, and the date that we could agree 
upon was 65, and I looked at the things I had to get

06:04.943 --> 06:15.457
finished before I could go, and I said, okay. And I 
worked up a big data sheet of titles of

06:16.058 --> 06:19.823
manuscripts, And I just settled down and wrote for 
months. That's why there was a sudden rush. All

06:26.154 --> 06:26.715
right, good. All of a sudden, I've got a sudden 
burst of things coming out on blue crabs and so

06:26.755 --> 06:32.145
forth, and I couldn't figure out where they came 
from. That's why. They seem to come from no place,

06:32.445 --> 06:35.571
haven't they? Okay. I wanted to get it all done 
before I went to Illinois. I didn't, but I got a lot

06:39.418 --> 06:40.680
of it done.

06:45.892 --> 06:50.318
What has been some of your significant findings in 
the field of Louisville development? If you just

06:50.338 --> 06:54.184
had to cite several significant things you 
discovered, what would you cite for yourself?

06:59.411 --> 07:09.185
Okay, first, the development of techniques which 
permit their culture in the laboratory under

06:59.411 --> 07:09.185
controlled conditions.

07:09.205 --> 07:12.490
Secondly, an understanding of the way in which the 
environment

07:22.308 --> 07:38.829
through one and two,

07:22.308 --> 07:38.829
making available large numbers, thousands of 
larval stages of known age and species for a

07:22.308 --> 07:38.829
variety of other experimental purposes. And then 
for the beginnings of an understanding of the

07:40.712 --> 07:51.606
hormonal mechanisms which regulate development 
in a fashion similar to the insects.

07:55.282 --> 08:07.477
How well do we know the feeding habits of various 
crustaceous lovers, by the way?

08:07.497 --> 08:24.478
Well enough to permit us to culture them, but when 
you get into the real nitty-gritty lurid details,

08:07.497 --> 08:24.478
there's still quite a great deal that could be 
learned if someone were sufficiently

08:07.497 --> 08:24.478
interested. Do you know enough for culture 
already? Oh, yeah. Have you thought of your

08:28.399 --> 08:39.154
studies of larval development, have you done it 
specifically to aid general knowledge, or have

08:28.399 --> 08:39.154
you thought of it in terms of your work in coastal 
management and aquaculture? Well, originally it

08:39.174 --> 08:48.406
was to provide a better understanding of 
development. I think all of us, when we are

08:48.426 --> 08:50.989
younger,

08:55.137 --> 09:00.262
And we're more concerned about the quest for 
knowledge. And then as you get a little bit older,

09:00.383 --> 09:09.092
you begin to realize that knowledge in itself, 
while it's desirable, is far more desirable if it

09:00.383 --> 09:09.092
has some use. And the sooner you can put it to good 
use, to me, the more rewarding it is. So that the

09:16.980 --> 09:23.727
fact that we are now able to use larvae as bioassay 
indicators for extremely

09:31.790 --> 09:38.580
I had 10 years ago, as an example.

09:40.723 --> 09:47.013
I now have a series of what amount to sort of 
standard questions on which I want opinions on.

09:47.033 --> 09:51.820
100%

09:47.033 --> 09:51.820
unguaranteed opinions, if you should like them. 
First of all, what do you consider your major

09:52.921 --> 09:57.368
accomplishment as a scientist? Well, I hope I 
haven't made it yet.

10:07.008 --> 10:27.174
I guess thus far, serving as director of this 
institution during its expansion phase, because

10:07.008 --> 10:27.174
in so doing I contributed to other people 
developing research programs, and that's the

10:07.008 --> 10:27.174
function of a director. All right, well that 
anticipates my next four questions, so let me just

10:27.434 --> 10:33.121
follow right with these. First of all, how do you 
explain your tremendous flurry of expansion in

10:35.543 --> 10:40.611
the 1960s for the lab here. Was it ONR and outside 
source funds or what? Well, it was primarily

10:44.777 --> 11:03.306
because Bookhouse saw a number of the things that 
are developing now well before they developed and

10:44.777 --> 11:03.306
began the necessary planning and, if you will, 
education of university officials. to be

11:03.961 --> 11:17.253
prepared for it, and also developing a sound 
academic, educational, intellectual base on

11:03.961 --> 11:17.253
which to do this expansion. For example, in 62 or 
63, Bookie became very concerned because

11:18.395 --> 11:31.707
biological oceanographers, especially those 
from smaller institutions, found it almost

11:18.395 --> 11:31.707
impossible to get ship time. I won't say why. And he 
convinced the National Science Foundation that

11:36.751 --> 11:55.619
they should fund the design and construction and 
management of a cooperative oceanographic

11:36.751 --> 11:55.619
vessel, which would give the biological 
oceanographers from the small institutions 10

11:36.751 --> 11:55.619
days of ship time completely free. Well, 10 years 
later, well, in the meantime, At the same time, to

12:00.661 --> 12:18.650
avoid bias and empire building, he insisted that 
it be coordinated by a seven-man committee, only

12:00.661 --> 12:18.650
one of whom could be from Duke, so that even though 
on paper we own the vessel, we can't run it in the

12:00.661 --> 12:18.650
selfish sense. Okay, ten years later, this 
concept evolved into UNOLS. University National

12:27.172 --> 12:37.269
Oceanographic Laboratory System for the running 
of all federally sponsored and funded

12:27.172 --> 12:37.269
oceanographic vessels in the United States. 
Well, Buckey was 10 years ahead of his time on that

12:37.289 --> 12:41.816
one and on a number of other things. He saw the fact 
that this laboratory would become more actively

12:41.876 --> 12:52.774
involved in a number of things and that we would 
have a need for expanded facilities, we would have

12:41.876 --> 12:52.774
a need for expanded staff, And it was about the time 
that this was agreed upon by the university, the

12:53.429 --> 13:10.169
National Science Foundation, in 67, that I came 
along as the director, so I have served as the

12:53.429 --> 13:10.169
director in the interim of this expansion. Now, 
secondly, why were you chosen as director? Let me

13:14.694 --> 13:17.918
warn you in advance, this question is loaded. 
Having myself come through large universities

13:18.573 --> 13:31.590
where I've gone back to teach, it's highly unusual 
for a man with his degree from a university to even

13:18.573 --> 13:31.590
return to the university, much less head the major 
establishment of marine biology at the

13:18.573 --> 13:31.590
university. How do you explain that? Well, I 
thought about it, and you know, I never will really

13:34.374 --> 13:39.260
know. The fight over inbreeding occurred 
earlier. In 59, actually while I was away on a leave

13:45.978 --> 14:04.886
of absence in Scotland, the Department of Zoology 
was approached about appointing me as an

13:45.978 --> 14:04.886
assistant professor, book out having made the 
recommendation. And I am told, of course I wasn't

14:05.947 --> 14:14.500
here, and maybe it's just as well, I'm told that 
there was a real knock down, drag out fight within

14:15.070 --> 14:17.754
the department over this question of inbreeding. 
For reasons that I will never know, the university

14:20.118 --> 14:24.104
decided to do it anyway. So that by the time the 67 
appointment came around, that issue had already

14:25.145 --> 14:30.794
been decided. And I assume that the university, in 
looking at potential candidates for the job, saw

14:32.496 --> 14:43.373
in me a person who was already settled in Beaufort 
and therefore apparently compatible with a small

14:44.483 --> 14:47.207
town. I had been the mayor of the town for two terms. 
I had been involved in all sorts of public

14:50.633 --> 14:57.303
endeavors like school bond referendum and that 
sort of thing. My academic record, other than

14:57.323 --> 15:07.960
teaching, for which I was not employed, was 
acceptable in terms of publication, involvement

14:57.323 --> 15:07.960
with national and international things. My 
administrative capacity had only been viewed

15:09.745 --> 15:19.477
through the management of research grants, of 
which I had at one time four or five. And I assumed

15:20.558 --> 15:29.669
that putting all those things together, they 
decided that rather than betting on a new horse,

15:20.558 --> 15:29.669
they would take a chance and bet on one that they 
knew. But

15:29.689 --> 15:35.736
that's all speculation, because nobody's ever 
told me.

15:40.002 --> 15:58.329
have you discovered as administrator or chief 
administrator of the lab here, have you

15:40.002 --> 15:58.329
discovered interpersonal relationships in the 
academic world have been particularly difficult

15:40.002 --> 15:58.329
or easy for you in direction of the lab?

15:58.349 --> 16:01.093
You better state the last phrase of that. Okay. As 
an administrator, have you found it difficult

16:03.536 --> 16:06.921
to... give direction to the laboratory and also 
continue to have interpersonal relationships

16:07.458 --> 16:13.747
with your faculty. Oh, not yet for the most part. 
But I think it's in part because I am an

16:18.313 --> 16:23.520
administrator secondly. I still think of myself 
as a scientist first and it's for that reason that I

16:25.063 --> 16:33.955
continue to spend as much time as I can doing 
research, publishing. And it's for this reason

16:34.745 --> 16:41.732
that I continue to accept financial support for 
research, because I feel I am obligated to do it if

16:34.745 --> 16:41.732
I've been given money to do it. I know people who are 
administrators first, and that's where you get in

16:43.954 --> 16:48.219
trouble. OK, now that's the fourth question. An 
interview I just had with Nirenberg, and I'm sure

16:51.722 --> 17:01.933
he wouldn't object to me using his name, he 
maintained that he had essentially given up

16:51.722 --> 17:01.933
research And he saw his role in the future, not as a 
researcher writing any more papers or doing this

17:02.656 --> 17:17.820
kind of thing, but as continuing to give direction 
to Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which he

17:02.656 --> 17:17.820
thought would be his major contribution to the 
scientific world. I take it from reading your

17:17.840 --> 17:21.285
publication list, you don't see your role that 
way. Is that a fair statement? It is a fair

17:23.048 --> 17:24.089
statement. And I think you've got to keep several 
things in mind. The facility that he administers

17:26.714 --> 17:29.658
is considerably larger. Yes. and I can see why it 
would be constantly threatening what little time

17:30.972 --> 17:39.880
he might have had left for research. This 
institution in my lifetime will never approach

17:39.900 --> 17:49.408
the size of his, in part by coincidence and in part 
because we don't want it to. We operate on the theme

17:50.429 --> 18:00.237
that a university facility like this functions 
best in some nebulous size range which we've not

17:50.429 --> 18:00.237
really defined. But the relationship between 
staff and students, students and students, is so

18:00.487 --> 18:11.944
important here that we don't want it to be the size 
of something that he's dealing with. So it's a

18:12.905 --> 18:14.728
different ballgame entirely.

18:17.992 --> 18:24.081
I am concerned about any person who gives 
direction to science on the basis of information

18:24.567 --> 18:30.175
which is either secondhand or obsolete. And I have 
seen in some number of the U.S. government

18:31.497 --> 18:42.854
agencies directors of scientific programs who 
had their last real excursion with science in

18:31.497 --> 18:42.854
1947. Their knowledge of today's frontiers are 
primarily 1947 ideas. And the direction that you

18:52.613 --> 18:57.059
get out of that sort of information is downhill. So 
that I will only continue to serve as director of

18:58.280 --> 19:06.931
this laboratory as long as provisions are made for 
me to have some time for research. And if that day

19:07.532 --> 19:15.702
does not, if the day comes when that is not 
possible, then somebody else can be director.

19:17.572 --> 19:20.154
I was going to ask you about the size of the 
institution. You've already answered that. Now I

19:21.656 --> 19:23.858
want to ask you about the students at the 
institution. Do you try to take primarily

19:25.179 --> 19:28.983
students from your own university? Or do you try to 
solicit applicants from elsewhere in the state

19:29.744 --> 19:33.367
and outside the state?

19:36.510 --> 19:42.456
Well, when Doc Kearse developed this place in 38, 
it was with Duke University in mind. And that soon

19:42.476 --> 19:47.140
became apparent that this was not realistic. 
because it began to attract students from other

19:48.318 --> 19:52.402
institutions. So that I inherited a tradition 
developed over almost 40 years of serving as a

19:52.442 --> 20:08.396
national laboratory insofar as marine training 
is concerned. And this has been expanded

20:08.416 --> 20:17.785
because some number of people at Duke over the 
years, have finished degrees with some

20:19.233 --> 20:31.030
involvement here, have gone out to institutions 
all over the United States, many of which did not

20:19.233 --> 20:31.030
have marine programs. If a student at their own 
institution comes to them for advice as to where to

20:32.492 --> 20:43.468
go for a program in marine biology, oceanography, 
they automatically send them here. they in turn go

20:43.988 --> 20:49.457
out to other institutions, so the whole thing 
builds up to a feedback mechanism. And that's

20:49.477 --> 20:50.678
where we are now. The gentleman teaching the 
marine invertebrate zoology course this summer

20:51.400 --> 21:01.616
at Beaufort is Robert Barnes, author of most 
likely the best-known text on invertebrate

20:51.400 --> 21:01.616
zoology in the world. He's a Duke Ph.D. He and I were 
roommates together as graduate students. I guess

21:07.405 --> 21:08.967
it's the old boy syndrome.

21:14.228 --> 21:18.373
sure that one of the reasons Bob came back is that he 
enjoys teaching here. Some number of students

21:18.953 --> 21:22.637
came to that course this summer because he's 
teaching here. And they will provide further

21:23.598 --> 21:28.343
feedback in 1983, 4, 5, and 6. We have expanded that 
traditional role to the international realm. And

21:33.950 --> 21:40.817
we're now in the third year of our so-called 
international training program, which I

21:33.950 --> 21:40.817
mentioned earlier. That will, in time, provide us 
with feedback from all over the world. And I think

21:46.929 --> 21:55.843
this is a very vital role that this laboratory can 
play as a facility of a privately endowed

21:46.929 --> 21:55.843
university. We are totally apart from any real 
political influence. And I think we have a

22:03.615 --> 22:06.340
responsibility that goes with that. Then you see 
your direction of this institution as more and

22:07.121 --> 22:11.167
more of a cosmopolitan. Very definitely.

22:15.468 --> 22:32.114
In giving leadership of sorts, if I may use that 
word, I'm not trying to imply that you gave total

22:15.468 --> 22:32.114
direction to the lab, but in giving leadership of 
sorts to the lab, were there any distinctive goals

22:15.468 --> 22:32.114
you had in mind when you took over your position?

22:35.759 --> 22:43.872
Yeah, to expand, well, remember that I inherited 
the situation where we knew that

22:48.087 --> 22:49.850
affiliated with the laboratory. This meant 
expanding the opportunities for students,

22:50.711 --> 23:06.754
expanding the facilities to accommodate those 
students who would be coming, and developing a far

22:50.711 --> 23:06.754
more interdisciplinary program than we had at 
that time. And that has led in turn to the greater

23:08.958 --> 23:17.470
involvement on the international realm, drawing 
on my own connections from the days of ONR and

23:08.958 --> 23:17.470
others. But we have had some number of objectives 
which are pretty well taken care of now. And now

23:26.198 --> 23:36.073
it's primarily a question of making certain that 
in becoming somewhat larger, we do not lose the

23:26.198 --> 23:36.073
quality which we like to think we have. Now that's 
the next question. What sort of directions do you

23:39.639 --> 23:44.807
foresee for your institution in the future?

23:51.875 --> 24:09.912
Well, as a facility of a university, some of that is 
already predetermined in the sense that we have as

23:51.875 --> 24:09.912
a major role the education of what we call senior 
and graduate level students. So that we must

24:09.932 --> 24:20.042
constantly be aware of what the trends are to 
provide the necessary coursework to prepare the

24:09.932 --> 24:20.042
students for those trends. maintaining a 
reasonable quality. And my own personal interest

24:23.808 --> 24:35.002
leans toward a further involvement insofar as the 
international community is concerned, but doing

24:23.808 --> 24:35.002
the same thing. So all we're doing is increasing 
the involvement, but not changing the program

24:36.084 --> 24:42.792
itself.

24:45.516 --> 24:49.000
Yeah.

24:50.785 --> 25:03.140
The assumption usually is, as the program grows 
larger and as the institution grows larger, that

24:50.785 --> 25:03.140
you tend to look for more specialized students. 
That is, people who are not oceanography

25:03.681 --> 25:11.951
undergraduates or what have you, but people who 
have a special science they can bring into the

25:03.681 --> 25:11.951
community, like marine zoology and so forth. Has 
this been your policy here? Well, the expansion

25:14.134 --> 25:16.557
that we have just finished,

25:27.134 --> 25:42.750
it became a separate inter-institutional 
facility, or rather inter-departmental

25:27.134 --> 25:42.750
facility of the university with resident staff 
from six of potentially seven different

25:27.134 --> 25:42.750
departments. So we have people here who are 
affiliated with departments in biochemistry,

25:43.531 --> 25:54.542
geology, botany, zoology, chemistry, and 
physiology med school. So that here is a very broad

25:56.125 --> 26:07.759
base from which to develop research programs, 
training programs, student involvement at

25:56.125 --> 26:07.759
either the state, national, or international 
level. And we've already begun to develop that.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.105
And I assume we will continue to. But we don't look 
for the development of people to know more and more

26:13.486 --> 26:23.719
about less and less in terms of one very narrow 
program. As some labs do, especially some of the

26:24.273 --> 26:35.808
European labs, if the professor has an interest in 
the third setos hair on the fourth abdominal

26:24.273 --> 26:35.808
appendage, then that's what they become known 
for. Well, that's not our interest at all. We want

26:39.973 --> 26:50.466
to have a broad base which will provide the proper 
research facilities, experience, and training

26:39.973 --> 26:50.466
for people who will go out and send their students 
back here. And I think that you see your role in

26:52.555 --> 27:00.864
oceanography, at least in the near future, as to 
continue to administer the lab.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.770
Well, insofar as Duke is concerned, yeah. I will 
continue to peck away at my own research interests

27:06.790 --> 27:16.521
relative to larval dispersal, larval 
development, oceanic dispersal. and continue to

27:17.480 --> 27:31.465
serve hopefully in a number of capacities insofar 
as the U.S. is concerned, the National

27:17.480 --> 27:31.465
Oceanographic Program, and continue to expand 
the international aspects. And all of these

27:31.485 --> 27:36.855
relate to oceanography, even though we're 
situated in the backwater of both.
