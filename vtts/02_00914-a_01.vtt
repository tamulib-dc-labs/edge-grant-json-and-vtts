00:03.811 --> 00:12.520
We are interviewing Mike Mahoney today at his home 
in Northeast Dallas. And Mike, I'd like to have you

00:14.442 --> 00:32.620
begin by recalling

00:14.442 --> 00:32.620
your first efforts at planning in Texas and then 
the events that you were connected with that you

00:14.442 --> 00:32.620
feel were really significant for Texas. and for 
planning education and so forth. OK. Maybe, Bob,

00:37.722 --> 00:55.508
it would be best to back up and explain, because 
it's hard for me to talk about my planning career in

00:37.722 --> 00:55.508
Texas without also talking about the segments in 
and out of the state which were taking place in

00:37.722 --> 00:55.508
Arizona. I started in the planning office in 
Tucson, which was then a city county planning

00:56.489 --> 01:02.758
office. in January of 1948.

01:09.107 --> 01:13.034
Worked there under a man by the name of Ed Wilson. 
Then in September of 1948, took a job in El Paso as

01:15.058 --> 01:27.160
assistant city planning engineer, that strange 
kind of title. under Walter E. Stockwell, who was

01:27.865 --> 01:34.931
then the planning engineer for the city and had 
been for many, many years.

01:37.713 --> 01:52.285
I was there until 1950, then in grad school at 
University of Oklahoma, then went back to Tucson

01:37.713 --> 01:52.285
in 1951 and worked again in the city county 
planning department. This time, though, under

01:53.827 --> 01:57.670
Andre M. Foer, Andre Melville for. He was related 
somehow or other to the famous Melville of Moby

02:00.733 --> 02:05.358
Dick. And Andy was a very forthright, down to 
earth, school of hard knocks planner who had a very

02:06.439 --> 02:21.976
deep sense of appreciation for design, a very deep 
sense of appreciation for human relations.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.719
Gained a great deal from Andy. And two years after 
that, In 1953, I had the good fortune to be

02:27.704 --> 02:37.539
designated as planning director for the city of 
Austin. So I was in Austin for the five-year period

02:37.559 --> 02:41.124
of 53 to 58. In 58,

02:41.224 --> 02:50.337
the lure of Arizona drew me back, plus some bad 
health experiences in Austin. And the doctor

02:50.357 --> 02:51.860
said, you better get out. And I went to Yuma, 
Arizona as head of the city county planning

02:53.041 --> 02:57.508
department. Small operation, but one that was 
very satisfying because I was able to work with a

02:58.012 --> 03:13.171
community that was really interested in trying to 
do something following some rather unhappy

02:58.012 --> 03:13.171
planning experiences that they had had. Some 
people in the city viewing it to be good, and some

03:14.012 --> 03:21.522
people in the city and the county viewing it not to 
be so good.

03:22.649 --> 03:31.437
For two years after that, after those four years, I 
was in Phoenix as assistant planning director

03:22.649 --> 03:31.437
when John Beatty was director. And then in 1964,

03:32.618 --> 03:39.644
became planning director in Fort Worth. Jerry 
Brownlee was then city manager. He was one of LP

03:43.027 --> 03:45.489
Cookingham's protégés. And it was partly because 
of that influence that I decided to make the switch

03:51.708 --> 04:00.716
and come back to Texas and was in the planning, as 
head of the planning office for the city of Fort

03:51.708 --> 04:00.716
Worth from 64 to 68. In 68,

04:00.736 --> 04:19.133
I left the city, went into private work, and 
remained in private practice essentially on a

04:00.736 --> 04:19.133
very active basis for about six years after that. 
However, during that time, then I decided that

04:20.547 --> 04:48.597
what I found myself doing was really trying to 
teach a lot of people in city government and in the

04:20.547 --> 04:48.597
community how to push the right buttons, which 
levers to pull, what doors to open and which doors

04:20.547 --> 04:48.597
to close in order for them to accomplish their 
civic objectives, community objectives.

04:48.948 --> 05:00.347
planning commissions, and boards of adjustment, 
and library boards, and park and recreation

04:48.948 --> 05:00.347
boards, citizen groups, neighborhood 
associations, and so on. And that was really kind

05:01.168 --> 05:16.052
of a culmination of things that turned me from 
being the, as much as I liked the design side of

05:01.168 --> 05:16.052
planning, I moved very strongly into the 
community relations side and went on to pursue a

05:16.960 --> 05:21.064
doctorate in adult continuing ed at North Texas. 
And then in, let's see, it's been 10 years ago, 11

05:21.144 --> 05:40.021
years ago now, in 1975, took a position at East 
Texas State University and really became the

05:21.144 --> 05:40.021
program director for the graduate program in 
adult continuing education at East Texas with

05:21.144 --> 05:40.021
both master's and doctoral programs. But all 
through those 10 years, I have continued to be

05:40.461 --> 05:46.967
involved as I was for roughly 10 years before that 
in some kind of adjunct types of planning

05:47.622 --> 06:13.512
activities, particularly with the Soil 
Conservation Service, very regularly, once or

05:47.622 --> 06:13.512
twice a year for them in their Fort Worth Regional 
Training Center, which is now their National

05:47.622 --> 06:13.512
Training Center.

06:14.032 --> 06:36.003
earlier for Southern Methodist University, 
teaching through the Department of Real Estate

06:14.032 --> 06:36.003
and Regional Science under Sid Reagan, teaching 
basic course in planning and then one graduate

06:14.032 --> 06:36.003
course in public policy and business 
administration combination. And before that, at

06:38.348 --> 06:57.953
TCU and the Urban Studies program and along the way 
at UT Arlington for the fifth year design classes

06:38.348 --> 06:57.953
in the School of Architecture and many many years 
before that as a critic for the University of Texas

06:38.348 --> 06:57.953
at Austin in the fifth year design classes in 
architecture and planning. So and earlier than

06:58.914 --> 07:04.761
that I guess yes when I was in Phoenix I was teaching 
for what was then called Phoenix Evening College.

07:09.161 --> 07:17.594
It's now the Maricopa County Community College 
District and was very much involved there.

07:18.315 --> 07:34.039
Educationally,

07:18.315 --> 07:34.039
my interest was really multifaceted because my 
first degree was in civil engineering from

07:18.315 --> 07:34.039
University of New Mexico, then graduate work at 
both UT Austin and Oklahoma in city and regional

07:34.205 --> 07:38.050
planning. Then, because of some of my interests on 
more mundane things of academia, I became one of

07:39.272 --> 08:03.165
the key players in designating the site for the 
Yuma County Community College District's

07:39.272 --> 08:03.165
eventual campus of 640 acres. east side of Yuma, 
became also instrumental in the locating of the

08:03.550 --> 08:14.923
south campus for the Tarrant County Junior 
College District. And I've kind of kept my oar in

08:16.084 --> 08:26.136
the pond all along on the education side of the 
ledgers over the years, as well as on the planning

08:16.084 --> 08:26.136
side. Now, where do you want me to back up? And what 
do you want me to fill in from all of this? Well, why

08:33.301 --> 08:39.428
don't you go back to your first experience in 
municipal planning. That would be in Austin. And

08:41.511 --> 08:45.996
any consultants that were active in Austin at that 
time? Well, the earlier ones were really within

08:46.016 --> 08:53.345
the state of Texas were really El Paso. And I think 
that one was somewhat unusual in that Walter

08:53.605 --> 08:59.292
Stockwell, who was then the planning engineer. 
And remember, this was in a period, the latter part

09:02.047 --> 09:06.712
of the 40s. Dan Ponder was then the mayor and very 
positive, aggressive individual.

09:16.181 --> 09:29.835
The city of El Paso in 1928 had

09:16.181 --> 09:29.835
designated or had hired as a consultant Mr. 
Kessler and I have a copy of that plan oh you do have

09:30.912 --> 09:58.759
okay and the Kessler plan came out of work that 
Walter Stockwell was very much involved in I think

09:30.912 --> 09:58.759
particularly with reference to that there were 
two things that somewhat stand out as

09:30.912 --> 09:58.759
accomplishments over the years since And some of 
these have only been accomplished within the last

09:59.465 --> 10:04.692
eight or ten years. One was the construction of a 
scenic route around Mount Franklin on the north

10:05.853 --> 10:17.789
side of downtown El Paso, more or less the north 
side of El Paso. And that has become, over the

10:17.809 --> 10:28.223
years, pretty much of a shortcut route from the 
northeast part of El Paso to the northwest part of

10:17.809 --> 10:28.223
El Paso. More significantly, though, quite a few 
miles further to the north, Walter Stockwell,

10:28.777 --> 10:53.102
encouraged, I think, by Mr. Kessler, had worked 
very strenuously in trying to carry out the one

10:28.777 --> 10:53.102
proposal that Kessler made, which I'm sure a lot of 
people thought was purely pie in the sky. And that

10:53.662 --> 10:57.366
was the building of a road through the Franklin 
Mountains, I say through, kind of meandering

10:57.886 --> 11:12.868
through the arroyos and the canyons, through an 
area called McKelligan Canyon. And that now

11:12.888 --> 11:27.049
connects the far north side of El Paso on the east 
with the far north side of El Paso on the west, a road

11:12.888 --> 11:27.049
that is really quite an accomplishment 
engineering-wise. It was a route that Kessler had

11:27.518 --> 11:34.427
the good sense to see was ultimately going to be 
needed. And this was in a day and time when El Paso,

11:34.467 --> 11:40.515
as I recall, maybe only had 60,000 people. And he 
was looking to the time when it would be 10 times

11:41.296 --> 11:48.546
that size and that the need would be very real. I 
think that's perhaps the major contribution.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.357
Walter Stockwell's major contribution was his 
tenacity. in digging away and pushing for things.

12:03.029 --> 12:14.744
Although he had had some physical health problems 
over the years, he hung in there very tenaciously

12:03.029 --> 12:14.744
like an animal just clawing onto its prey. And he 
would not let go. And he said, we will do these

12:17.047 --> 12:19.090
things. And he would find ways with changes in the 
mayors who were the actual administrators of the

12:27.391 --> 12:37.266
city, even though they changed political beliefs 
and so on, he would constantly find a way to

12:27.391 --> 12:37.266
convince them to move ahead on projects. And so I 
think of the planters in the state probably,

12:37.286 --> 12:54.833
although he came from a very different time and a 
very different orientation, Walter Stockwell

12:37.286 --> 12:54.833
probably had in his own unique way as much that is 
merited in the way of dedication and

12:55.302 --> 13:05.113
accomplishment as any planner in the state. What 
was the relationship between Stockwell and

13:05.133 --> 13:09.518
Cunningham?

13:10.740 --> 13:16.246
I had left, and John Cunningham came in much later. 
I don't know what the relationship was. I'm sorry,

13:19.590 --> 13:24.195
I can't really speak to that. When I was in Austin 
from 53 to 58, I went in under a set of circumstances

13:24.479 --> 13:39.700
that were very, I think, very beneficial to me and 
very unusual. The city of Austin had just then,

13:40.601 --> 13:51.516
within a matter of 60 days before, 45 days before, 
adopted a new city charter. And for the first time,

13:53.065 --> 14:01.355
the city of Boston had a section in its charter 
devoted to city planning. And that section of the

14:02.376 --> 14:09.585
charter has since been amended once, maybe twice. 
But that section of the charter gave a very strong

14:11.047 --> 14:21.840
recognition to the role of, as it was designated, 
the master plan. gave a very strong

14:22.546 --> 14:30.574
responsibility to the Planning Commission to 
move forward on a master plan for the city. During

14:31.855 --> 14:44.387
the time that I was there, Martin from the School of 
Architecture at UT was appointed to the Planning

14:31.855 --> 14:44.387
Commission. He was one of the new appointees 
coming in under the charter revision, charter

14:51.048 --> 14:53.972
reform program. And really, this charter was a 
wholesale revamping of the old city charter. And I

14:58.619 --> 15:07.551
mean like 95% of it was a complete redo in concept, 
in philosophy, in structure, everything. Walter

15:08.713 --> 15:12.078
Sehome was the city manager and the man I reported 
to. And you wouldn't. Yeah, I'm sorry. Oh, you want

15:16.344 --> 15:17.425
to go ahead? Yeah. All right. Immediately 
following the organization of the Planning

15:21.220 --> 15:43.261
Commission under the new charter,

15:21.220 --> 15:43.261
I was asked to establish some guidelines for the 
employment of a planning consultant to help us

15:21.220 --> 15:43.261
move quickly on a master plan. And in the process, 
we had sent out invitations to a number of

15:49.773 --> 15:51.376
individuals. Needless to say, we contacted the 
old faithfuls like Bartholomew and Segoe. And

16:00.552 --> 16:09.408
then we had some others who were not as well known, 
but in various ways had something to offer us. I

16:09.849 --> 16:14.397
felt city manager was not particularly 
knowledgeable By the way, Walter was an

16:14.748 --> 16:21.173
electrical engineer by background, came through 
the electric utility, which was municipally

16:14.748 --> 16:21.173
owned. And so lots of things turned on decisions 
that really affected the electric utility. That

16:27.459 --> 16:29.721
was the first decision point. Then after that, 
then the community came in as the decision point.

16:35.085 --> 16:43.793
So many times, the profit and loss statement in the 
electric utility controlled a lot of what

16:35.085 --> 16:43.793
happened in city government. Strange. But 
normally also the electric utility made lots of

16:44.684 --> 16:53.734
money for the city and that was fine, but a lot of the 
city budget was dependent on that electric

16:44.684 --> 16:53.734
utility. So everything sort of shifted to what is 
going to be good for the electric utility and if

16:53.754 --> 17:08.650
that's good for that element then obviously we're 
going to make money and therefore that will help

16:53.754 --> 17:08.650
underwrite the rest of the operating budget of the 
city. Planning being one of those that, of course,

17:09.423 --> 17:16.232
was dependent upon the various revenue sources. 
In the process,

17:16.252 --> 17:36.038
we had the experience of a last minute applicant 
who had not been contacted by us in the regular

17:16.252 --> 17:36.038
process. through a contact he had made, he just 
happened to be coming through town, I think, as

17:37.368 --> 18:06.852
best I know, he had either been,

17:37.368 --> 18:06.852
for some reason, made contact with Hugo Leipziger 
at UT Austin or Martin Kermesie, and at that point,

17:37.368 --> 18:06.852
and there was really within only a matter of four or 
five days of the closing of the the bid time or

18:07.507 --> 18:18.164
proposal time, we had an 11th hour and 59th minute 
submittal by Hal Wise. And looking back, I must

18:20.488 --> 18:30.464
say, at the time, I was a little annoyed because I 
hadn't had a chance to visit with Hal, tell him what

18:20.488 --> 18:30.464
the situation was on the ground. But at the same 
time, Looking back, I can also say I was very

18:33.460 --> 18:43.450
pleased with the energy that Hal Wise's operation 
provided us. That was the plus part of the whole

18:44.631 --> 18:47.434
business. Hal brought in Harry Halliton. I don't 
remember which city Harry was in before that.

18:59.870 --> 19:19.354
He also brought in Bruce Weber as a researcher, 
W-A-Y-B-U-R.

18:59.870 --> 19:19.354
Harry G. Halliton, Harry the Horse Halliton, as he 
was known, was the resident planner. And he was

19:20.795 --> 19:28.645
very effective in organizing a local staff for 
Halwise. technician and a couple of people that

19:29.840 --> 19:57.957
were employed on an occasional basis and a 
secretary and then Bruce Weber came in

19:29.840 --> 19:57.957
periodically in various parts of the research 
program Bruce is and I think this may say something

19:29.840 --> 19:57.957
about him Bruce's has long since passed away but 
kind of a side story. Bruce was in the service as a

20:01.533 --> 20:05.717
translator. He at that time had a PhD in German and 
history when he went into the service during World

20:05.817 --> 20:14.506
War II. He was assigned to Patton's unit when they 
were moving in up the Italian peninsula and he

20:15.187 --> 20:26.779
wound up wherever it was that Patton's 
headquarters were to be located just before

20:27.248 --> 20:33.218
Patton was killed. And Bruce was assigned to the 
intelligence unit specifically to gather

20:35.342 --> 20:50.106
information on the Krupp interests and the other 
industrial interests. One of his jobs was to find

20:50.126 --> 20:53.492
out where the various records were of all these 
German industrialists, because these were not at

20:54.434 --> 21:03.567
the company locations in Germany. The 
industrialists saw the handwriting on the wall,

21:05.009 --> 21:19.791
they knew that the Allies were soon going to 
overpower Germany and the Axis, and they spirited

21:05.009 --> 21:19.791
their records away to all kinds of places. Bruce 
and a couple of other and he was like a tech sergeant

21:22.868 --> 21:29.755
or staff sergeant at that time. He told this story 
of having located some of the Krupp records, and it

21:31.036 --> 21:51.576
was a whole trunk full of Krupp industrialist 
records on the third or fourth floor of a house in

21:31.036 --> 21:51.576
this small village where they were going through 
How he got onto this, I don't know, except by

21:52.568 --> 22:00.618
process of just asking people questions about 
things that had been brought in. And he and another

22:01.880 --> 22:20.803
soldier were carrying this trunk of materials 
down to their jeep to take it into the intelligence

22:01.880 --> 22:20.803
office so that the materials could be gone over 
piece by piece in preparation for the Nuremberg

22:01.880 --> 22:20.803
trials. And as Bruce said, described the 
situation as typical in so many European

22:22.032 --> 22:31.623
buildings, the stairwells are very narrow. And he 
said they were having trouble with this very, very

22:32.705 --> 22:36.549
heavy trunk. And he said it must have weighed 300 
pounds, because it was full of paper. And he said in

22:42.736 --> 22:50.245
the process, they made a turn, and they had trouble 
tipping the trunk so they could carry it down. And

22:50.265 --> 22:51.887
he said, I was the man on the bottom. of the stairs 
carrying the trunk down and he said all at once

22:52.559 --> 23:17.925
behind me there was this booming voice that cried 
out something like this soldier you're in my way

22:52.559 --> 23:17.925
and Bruce said he turned around and looked and here 
it was George Patton and he said sir I'm sorry, I'm

23:19.593 --> 23:26.220
in your way, but I don't have anywhere else to go. 
And so Patton quizzed him right then and there.

23:28.542 --> 23:30.003
What was he doing there? Why were they moving this 
trunk? He explained what his mission was. And

23:33.787 --> 23:45.038
Patton, at that point, usually with his gloves on 
and everything, pulled his gloves off and said,

23:33.787 --> 23:45.038
here, let me give you a hand.

23:47.981 --> 23:48.722
And he said at that stage, everything changed. He 
said Patton helped them down the next two flights

23:52.334 --> 24:00.103
and helped them load the truck on the jeep. Then 
proceeded to write out a note. He took down Waber's

24:03.868 --> 24:13.340
name and said, Sergeant Waber, if I can do anything 
for you, here's an official pass. You may come to my

24:13.360 --> 24:17.865
offices or my tent anytime you need to. and

24:19.246 --> 24:49.185
Bruce said he was so shocked by the whole thing 
because Patton's reputation of course was always

24:19.246 --> 24:49.185
one of being very gruff and pretty demanding of 
everyone but he said it was a very heartening

24:19.246 --> 24:49.185
experience and he said as a matter of fact he did go 
in a day or two later and he had a drink with Patton

24:19.246 --> 24:49.185
and he said Patton really expressed his 
appreciation for the work that the intelligence

24:49.587 --> 25:18.008
people were doing because he said without that 
work this is the way he told waver he said without

24:49.587 --> 25:18.008
that work we will not be able to win this war

24:49.587 --> 25:18.008
so much for the side story bruce was an extremely 
accomplished researcher and a very good writer

24:49.587 --> 25:18.008
you mentioned that he had been he came from marin 
county Yes, I think Bruce was, I believe, located

25:18.308 --> 25:27.217
at Marin County before he went to work for Hal Wise. 
What year are we talking about? Well, Hal came in in

25:29.900 --> 25:38.788
54,

25:29.900 --> 25:38.788
let's see, yes, I guess it was 1954. To Austin. To 
Austin, right. And Bruce came along just within a

25:42.973 --> 25:46.476
matter of, four weeks behind me. So this was 
probably the middle, late spring or middle of

25:51.801 --> 25:57.668
1954.

26:02.574 --> 26:16.632
When Hal Wise came to Austin, I think there was one 
immediate contribution, and that was that

26:02.574 --> 26:16.632
through a series of community meetings, And there 
were quite a few of them. I don't remember the

26:18.758 --> 26:32.312
number now, except that there was one like every 
three or four weeks for probably a period of four or

26:18.758 --> 26:32.312
five months, six months.

26:33.334 --> 26:38.719
I remember three questions of how always ask, and 
you've probably heard these before. After a

26:39.780 --> 26:47.108
presentation of some of the problems and some of 
the that the city was having and some of the

26:47.543 --> 26:59.057
information that came out of the basic census 
records and land use records and so on that we

26:47.543 --> 26:59.057
already had compiled to some extent. Hal would 
always ask people, what do you like most, what do

26:59.078 --> 27:05.866
you like least about your city, and what do you want 
to see changed? Of course, a very good format of a

27:05.886 --> 27:13.636
paradigm for ferreting out public opinion. But it 
built, I think, a lot of people who were very much

27:17.227 --> 27:45.833
concerned about the way the city was going and a 
confidence that our planning effort our

27:17.227 --> 27:45.833
comprehensive planning effort would be 
reasonably successful what came out of the plan

27:17.227 --> 27:45.833
it's beyond the plan itself which was as I see it a 
pretty good document over the long haul. In fact, a

27:48.214 --> 27:51.577
remarkably good document over the long haul. And 
I'm speaking between the mid-1950s and the

27:53.039 --> 27:59.545
mid-1980s.

28:01.807 --> 28:15.600
While the plan has been updated, many of the basic 
concepts that were contained in the planning

28:01.807 --> 28:15.600
recommendations, which did involve involve a 
very heavy consultant input, but also involve a

28:15.766 --> 28:27.519
substantial amount of citizen reflection on 
those inputs. A lot of those concepts and

28:29.581 --> 28:37.771
principles have been adhered to down through the 
years since. One of the initial, or I should say one

28:37.791 --> 28:44.338
of the initial, one of the initial issues the 
public expressed concern about was the Missouri

28:44.858 --> 29:14.815
Pacific Railroad which came down through the west 
side of Austin north-south alignment to the west

28:44.858 --> 29:14.815
side of Austin that route

28:44.858 --> 29:14.815
was always a point of contention because to get a 
full load fully loaded train out of Austin going

28:44.858 --> 29:14.815
upgrade it would usually take about four to six 
diesel units to pull the train. And that train

29:23.682 --> 29:28.068
could not go more than about 20 miles an hour going 
up that grade. In fact, that was, at that time, the

29:28.589 --> 29:35.720
steepest grade in the state of Texas for any 
distance at all. It was then about a 10-mile grade,

29:37.102 --> 29:45.274
and it was the steepest one in the state.

29:46.739 --> 29:59.411
That, of course, as a point of contention for a lot 
of citizens, resulted in the establishment of the

29:46.739 --> 29:59.411
Missouri Pacific Freeway alignment. So-called 
Mopac. The Mopac, right. Mopac Boulevard, as it's

30:03.375 --> 30:05.057
known. And that now, of course, has been extended 
way on to what would be called the northwest side of

30:05.898 --> 30:15.447
Austin.

30:17.063 --> 30:19.205
15 miles out from downtown. And also recently to 
the south. Yeah, and has been extended to the south

30:21.949 --> 30:27.315
now across the Reviton.

30:28.296 --> 30:37.306
The concepts of that particular thing, the whole 
concept of that corridor was one of the issues. A

30:38.407 --> 30:43.273
second one that Hal did capitalize on although I 
think in the years since it has not been preserved

30:44.097 --> 30:56.507
quite as well as it should have been, was the very 
strong commitment to the recreation facilities

30:44.097 --> 30:56.507
in Austin. Beverly Sheffield had been recreation 
director for the city for a number of years. He was

31:04.834 --> 31:13.902
an aquatics man, a person who believed very 
strongly in aquatics experiences for kids

31:04.834 --> 31:13.902
starting at age five or four or younger, and he was 
the instigator of the concept of free

31:14.590 --> 31:24.364
neighborhood pools.

31:24.484 --> 31:43.332
That largely came about because sometime during 
the 1930s, Austin had the drowning of a small

31:24.484 --> 31:43.332
youngster in one of the large municipal pools, 
which was the one down on Riverside. down next to

31:44.037 --> 31:45.256
the river.
