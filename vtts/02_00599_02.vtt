00:03.001 --> 00:12.876
how

00:03.001 --> 00:12.876
to make politics more, how to end corruption in 
politics. I'm an optimist. I wouldn't have been

00:14.498 --> 00:17.022
running that many times. I wouldn't have spent 
everything earned on political campaigns. I'd be

00:20.266 --> 00:25.434
working dead now in the law practice, the solo 
practice stage of 81. But I spent, I made good money

00:26.035 --> 00:32.164
practicing law, spent it and raised it because I 
couldn't raise much money, very little money. run

00:32.988 --> 00:35.952
because of my positions and what I've done. They 
knew the first time I ran for statewide office for

00:36.512 --> 00:40.657
Attorney General, 38. From those suits I tried to 
eat, what I knew, they bought me from the

00:41.198 --> 00:46.404
beginning. I'd already served notice. I'd fanned 
the best they could put up in the courtroom. And it

00:53.553 --> 00:58.499
wasn't that easy out on the stump, where money 
counts more. And it's a big state with many

00:58.579 --> 01:02.944
millions of people. widened and dispersed over 
the state, and it's expensive getting a message

01:03.346 --> 01:08.665
out to them. I took campaign after campaign before 
I could get well enough acquainted to win. The

01:14.787 --> 01:27.766
Texas Observer pointed out in 1972 that, quote, 
Yarborough proved in three terms in the U.S.

01:14.787 --> 01:27.766
Senate that a strong person can hold high office 
and remain uncorrupted, unquote. Do you think

01:27.787 --> 01:29.790
this is still possible today? And if so, how do you 
think, who do you think are examples of this, both

01:29.810 --> 01:36.800
in Washington and Austin? Well, I think that, 
surely I think it's possible today. And I don't

01:42.479 --> 01:50.668
think that I kicked myself letting them take that 
office away from the people when I was defeated.

01:50.768 --> 01:58.557
But I had my Cold War GI Bill amendments to make it 
stronger finally passed in March or in April with

01:50.768 --> 01:58.557
the primary in May. I think if I had come back down 
here three or four months before that campaign, I

01:59.058 --> 02:04.845
don't think I would have lost even without money. 
But the fact that I was there passing those bills, I

02:05.445 --> 02:09.310
was passing major bills. I passed the OSHA, the 
Occupational Health and Safety Bill. chairman of

02:12.483 --> 02:21.053
that full committee and I made them come in and 
threatened to open the doors and invite the press

02:12.483 --> 02:21.053
and read to the Lord who was breaking the form if 
they didn't. That's kind of unprotocol-ish but it

02:21.073 --> 02:40.195
was my last year I was defeated and I was determined 
to get it passed and did in December of 1970 and I

02:21.073 --> 02:40.195
passed the biggest, we needed the 
hospitalization badge at the end, I passed the

02:21.073 --> 02:40.195
biggest hospital bill in the history of the 
country because for the first time, instead of

02:40.563 --> 02:47.450
just building a new hospital, to put money in there 
to renovate an old one, to build an additional

02:40.563 --> 02:47.450
wing. There's a lot of wastage in it. You couldn't 
touch an old hospital, but just build a new one. We

02:52.515 --> 02:57.921
put those amendments on there that amounted to, 
the paper said, $5,700,000,000. It was about a

02:58.261 --> 02:59.462
year. That's about five years. Well, Nixon vetoed 
it. I'd been defeated. And when you're sponsoring

03:05.629 --> 03:09.793
a deal, you're the author and the sponsor and 
chairman of the health subcommittee. the

03:10.246 --> 03:18.094
majority leader of the Democrats when the 
majority doesn't handle a bill in the Senate by

03:10.246 --> 03:18.094
hand making you stand up and present it and try to 
pass it. You do it yourself, y'all. So passed it all

03:20.877 --> 03:22.018
right. Nixon vetoed it. He felt safe about it 
because no lame duck senator had passed a bill over

03:23.139 --> 03:30.968
a presidential veto in 57 years. I passed that 
hospital bill over Nixon's veto first The first

03:35.845 --> 03:40.331
one since the direct election of the United States 
Senators had started in 1913. The first time that a

03:40.391 --> 03:45.317
lamed up Senator had passed a bill for the 
President's veto. And that was one of my kudos that

03:46.098 --> 03:50.784
I had. But, so, yes, if I had to come back here and 
just, and people warned me. Russell Long told me,

03:57.693 --> 04:02.359
he said, he just quit and left about five months 
before his election. He said, I figured my

04:02.913 --> 04:09.982
election was more important than these bills that 
came up a few months here. And I had my bills, and I

04:10.002 --> 04:13.466
worked on them there, and didn't get back here. 
They made great hay of that, very effective hay.

04:17.051 --> 04:19.995
They said, look there, he's got the tonic fever, 
got the . Has he been back in your county this past

04:20.495 --> 04:24.821
year, two years, three years? Well, when I went 
there, the Congress was in session about eight or

04:24.841 --> 04:28.626
nine months a year. But those latter years, They 
were in session 12 months a year. Of course, now

04:32.565 --> 04:36.089
they take a recess in the summer and take another 
fall. They weren't taking other weekends.

04:37.171 --> 04:41.417
They're working 12 months through, and that was 
beating us Democrats because we weren't. That's

04:41.437 --> 04:51.791
what helped break the common cause, plus the fact 
that it wouldn't take any vacation time or help

04:41.437 --> 04:51.791
eliminate those Democratic majorities in 
Congress. Who do you think are examples of strong,

04:51.811 --> 04:58.620
uncorrupted leaders, both in Washington and 
Austin? Well, there are plenty. I'm not there on

05:01.809 --> 05:06.656
the ground enough to know and to see them and to 
know. I can only speak from what you read in the

05:07.598 --> 05:10.842
newspapers. When I was there with all the 
information you gathered from different

05:10.862 --> 05:17.491
sources, newspaper men, staff and all, you knew. 
But I don't know now. I know over in the Senate, the

05:20.576 --> 05:27.105
people that I consider incorruptible, Cranston, 
California, ran a very poor race for the

05:28.587 --> 05:32.974
presidency because he was bald and wasn't 
handsome. And then he got sick in the middle of it.

05:34.837 --> 05:39.123
He's the oldest one running, and it's terrible for 
the oldest one to get sick. And it liquidated him.

05:41.787 --> 05:48.478
And Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts there, 
absolutely financially improper, but you can't

05:41.787 --> 05:48.478
touch them. They're richer than anybody else. If 
somebody come in and try to insult one of them to

05:50.521 --> 05:56.450
bribe him, I don't think it's ever happened. He 
did. He'd be, of course, that's not true of all men.

06:00.129 --> 06:02.571
Some are so greedy they want more and more all the 
time. Not the Kennedys. They're dedicated

06:03.312 --> 06:04.833
people. I served on the committee with all three of 
the Kennedy brothers. They all got on that

06:07.816 --> 06:12.019
committee because that's where you could pass 
legislation to help people. And I figured up last

06:12.840 --> 06:20.927
year the total number of years I was serving with 
the Kennedy brother on that committee was over 15.

06:21.407 --> 06:26.792
Because sometimes two of them would be on there at 
one time, Ted Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. and I do

06:27.430 --> 06:29.992
serve them, but they are. There are plenty of 
others. I just don't know them as well as, I think,

06:32.514 --> 06:39.861
the one in that category was Joe Clark of 
Pennsylvania. I mentioned him earlier. There are

06:41.122 --> 06:43.083
a lot of them. How about here in Austin? Most of 
them, though, let me say this. Most of them who are

06:46.666 --> 06:51.891
incorruptible don't walk around saying, I'm not a 
crook, I'm an honest man. They think that virtue is

06:53.272 --> 06:57.015
its own role. They don't go around. The man goes 
around saying, I don't take money on the table. I'm

07:01.141 --> 07:01.922
an honest man. You'd better look out for it. You'd 
better start peeping on the table, see when it's

07:03.644 --> 07:06.627
reaching for it. How about in Austin? Well, not 
that close. In fact, no, we are not that close up

07:11.713 --> 07:16.539
there, out of that hundred. And A1 people, there 
are plenty of

07:16.559 --> 07:21.164
incorruptible people. Plenty. Some on the other 
side, too. What do you think the administration of

07:25.666 --> 07:37.098
President Reagan's, the effects of the 
administration have been on the United States,

07:25.666 --> 07:37.098
particularly in the areas of education and child 
welfare? It's been a disaster, an unlimited

07:37.678 --> 07:41.302
disaster. The great American historian, I think 
the greatest living historian, Mr. Steele

07:41.322 --> 07:52.433
Cumminger, you know, he says that this 
administration

07:53.341 --> 07:58.167
is the least compassionate administration in all 
the history of America. The whole history is down

07:58.187 --> 08:00.870
on that weight. They have cut hundreds of 
thousands out of colleges. They'll never have an

08:03.834 --> 08:05.516
opportunity to go. We built that up. I told you 
about $11 million I left there, and the bills we

08:06.977 --> 08:14.587
passed, they built it up at one time to $13 million. 
There are 139 colleges in Texas, 66 lost

08:14.767 --> 08:21.475
enrollment last fall and lower enrollments than 
there were before. I'll give a sample of One

08:21.927 --> 08:25.431
Direction. We had passed a bill there to provide 
that in the case the parents died before they were

08:25.451 --> 08:45.894
old enough to get, go there and work and grow their 
social security, and many do through terrible

08:25.451 --> 08:45.894
crashes on the old, on the highways and so bad, and 
through occupation and safety. Our occupation

08:45.974 --> 08:50.820
and safety laws are the weakest of any industrial 
measure in the world. and many are killed in the

08:51.053 --> 08:56.240
industry, leaves the young children without the 
breadwinner there. So we passed the law that they

08:56.941 --> 09:13.703
could go to college four years, not beyond their 
22nd year, not to lure them back in if they'd raised

08:56.941 --> 09:13.703
a family of 45 or something while they were young, a 
chance to have a maximum four years college

08:56.941 --> 09:13.703
education. By January of 1981, when Reagan took 
office, there were 700,000 of those in college And

09:20.888 --> 09:26.035
the spring, not of this year, but of last year, that 
was $250,000 less. He got an executive order. He

09:28.999 --> 09:31.662
entered an executive order, and he had the power to 
do that. Not to take anybody out of college, but to

09:32.183 --> 09:36.128
cut off, to modify. And this reform they were 
talking about of Social Security cut out that

09:36.148 --> 09:42.116
$700,000 in college. The last of them were there, 
and $55,000 would be there last year. It had been

09:46.582 --> 09:50.828
cut down then to have $250,000 less, and about 
$360,000 less in college and cutting it

09:51.095 --> 09:56.102
constantly. I don't know what it is this year. It's 
much less than that. And $455,000 would be that

09:59.468 --> 10:01.631
last year. Now, I've talked to the admissions 
officer out here to give you a sample of how this

10:02.352 --> 10:06.077
works. The admissions officer last year, I don't 
have the September figures, but up through the

10:06.738 --> 10:17.895
spring of 84, three years of Reaganomics. There 
were 19,500 students at the University of Texas

10:18.280 --> 10:31.312
out of the some 45,000 there who were going to the 
university under some form of federal grant loan

10:18.280 --> 10:31.312
or grant or a combination of them. That had fallen 
by last spring of 84 to 14,500, 5,000 less. That's

10:37.238 --> 10:47.427
over 25% in three years in all categories 
together, just over 25% less. dropped, fallen in

10:47.677 --> 10:52.662
enrollment, but they've got more fluent students 
in there. There's room for others, there's more

10:52.682 --> 10:56.386
money to come in. And then another category, they, 
we had the National Defense Education Loans. That

11:03.453 --> 11:14.224
was to lend money to students whose, whose wealth 
was such they couldn't come in on the poverty

11:03.453 --> 11:14.224
programs, but their parents could borrow money 
They could borrow money, but the federal

11:14.980 --> 11:17.724
government insured it. They insured the loans. 
Many men's college owned insured U.S. loans,

11:19.827 --> 11:27.698
borrowed from banks, savings and loans, credit 
unions, anywhere like that. Credit placed the

11:27.798 --> 11:30.682
federal government insuring the loan. Now, they 
changed the criteria. They required, under

11:33.626 --> 11:43.840
Reagan, that for that student to borrow, the 
family had to go on the note, the parents or the

11:33.626 --> 11:43.840
guardian, and they had to be able to pay it back if 
the student couldn't. That made the family the

11:44.005 --> 11:48.271
insurer rather than the U.S. government. The U.S. 
government insured it, but the family was

11:48.292 --> 11:51.356
standing in between. And that took out the 
students that had no family resources to borrow

11:51.416 --> 11:58.747
that money to pay it back if they couldn't. And that 
pushed that group into upper echelon bracket, the

11:58.767 --> 12:08.242
family with the wealth to pay it back if the student 
couldn't. Now, with those two categories, the

12:08.262 --> 12:11.667
admission officer out here told me, he said, The 
tragedy of this is seeing both categories lose.

12:16.182 --> 12:27.258
It's what you'd call the lower middle income group 
that we lose in students among whom we find some of

12:16.182 --> 12:27.258
the greatest dedication, some of the hardest 
work, some of the greatest desire to succeed. But

12:27.278 --> 12:33.026
from that group, asking who the lower middle class 
is, they're not going to tell you that. You find out

12:33.046 --> 12:34.087
yourself. But you go look at the income tax returns 
in the World Almanac, you can find those

12:34.188 --> 12:41.518
categories of what they earn and so forth. And in 
certain categories, there are many categories,

12:42.241 --> 12:47.469
but they give some big ones. School teachers, 
policemen, firemen, small farmers, small

12:47.489 --> 12:56.663
businessmen, people in the middle class, called 
middle class, but in lower income groups. Their

12:56.683 --> 12:57.785
children are out. And they said they had those 
parents were killed. No other way to go to college.

13:02.972 --> 13:06.518
No other way where they lost their credit. That's 
the economics of the Reagan era. It's a disaster.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.559
And if it keeps on, they're going to be fewer. And 
it's heightened here in Texas where they're

13:14.639 --> 13:25.312
fixing to triple or quadruple or quintuple the 
tuition per hour that students pay in

13:14.639 --> 13:25.312
state-supported institutions of higher 
learning. That's going to worsen it here in Texas

13:25.332 --> 13:35.085
when Reagan has gotten the Congress to go along 
with him to cut down on this at the national level,

13:25.332 --> 13:35.085
cutting deeply into student aid. And then the 
state raises the tuition. They've been paying it

13:37.768 --> 13:39.771
out at the same time. It's going to be a disaster. 
And what Texas is doing, the other states are

13:41.588 --> 13:44.814
probably going to do there. Raising tuition to 
make up for the federal money and all that. And if

13:50.644 --> 14:01.264
this keeps on another four years, unless the 
Congress takes hold and kicks Reagan in the shins

13:50.644 --> 14:01.264
and back in, then they ought to run the education on 
all sides. They ought to just beat them on all sides

14:01.324 --> 14:04.189
if they have any nerve. It's kind of a bunch of 
gutless wonders that all this happened, except

14:04.709 --> 14:10.036
they didn't say nothing. They said, so mildly, 
they wonder whether they mean this or not. They

14:13.621 --> 14:16.765
ought to be shouting from the housetops. People 
will look back at the 60s and 70s in the future, if

14:17.306 --> 14:24.856
this continues, as the golden age of American 
education. Most students had a chance. Most of

14:26.678 --> 14:31.625
all the young people had a chance to get an 
education. When you were a senator from Texas...

14:34.510 --> 14:37.173
The Texas press didn't cover you very often. There 
was sort of a press blackout. Yeah. What do you

14:41.999 --> 14:43.381
attribute that to? Oh, the fact that the big money 
in Texas was opposed to me. I was voting for people.

14:47.546 --> 14:48.507
They weren't students. You didn't. I was 
partially responsible. I didn't put a lot of press

14:50.910 --> 14:55.455
releases out about all these bills that are 
passing for education. Of course, they had the

14:55.856 --> 14:59.941
people of Texas brainwashed against that. So that 
federal money, the $8, I was out in the panhandle

15:02.371 --> 15:12.926
that they were dedicating a dam where I'd got 
money, and had a school that had grown up on the

15:02.371 --> 15:12.926
banks of that lake up there on the Canadian River, 
and I said, did you get that aid? The trooper in

15:13.147 --> 15:16.852
there says, no, we don't want any of that federal 
money in here. We're Texans. We're Texans. He

15:18.675 --> 15:19.977
wouldn't accept federal aid. He had his kids more 
poorly educated than those in some other

15:19.997 --> 15:24.683
districts. Because he didn't get that money for 
the scientific equipment. He didn't have it for

15:27.728 --> 15:30.572
the language, all these boos. where each kid in his 
foreign language class in high school had his own

15:30.873 --> 15:38.502
booth satisfied with the money he put in on the 
National Defense Education Program. What do you

15:40.905 --> 15:43.828
see as the future of the Democratic Party? Back to 
your other question. Another reason for that, I

15:46.632 --> 15:50.817
complained to the Associated Press when I had 
releases. I had some bills I prayed about,

15:50.917 --> 15:59.327
especially my park bills and all, about the unfair 
treatment I was getting compared to the... to the,

16:00.556 --> 16:07.347
uh, the tower, the Republican Center, and all. In 
fact, they had no notice of what I was doing, just,

16:07.567 --> 16:24.154
they were trying to make people believe I was a 
married man, and then completely no influence of

16:07.567 --> 16:24.154
what they were really

16:07.567 --> 16:24.154
trying to do, so they could beat me in the next 
election. Well, uh, he, uh, AP says, we've checked

16:29.125 --> 16:31.568
that. We send this out. There's a regional 
distribution point. Kansas City, I believe,

16:35.614 --> 16:38.618
said, we're giving you a fair break. All the 
stories going out of Washington, we're giving you

16:38.638 --> 16:41.482
a fair break. He says, the paper's infected. Don't 
worry. It's not cut out here in Washington. It's

16:45.687 --> 16:47.230
cut out down at the lower level. And they say, well, 
what they don't want. And they just wouldn't take

16:50.394 --> 16:52.036
anything. I got some good publicity out of it. 
Negatively, if they had something attacking me,

16:56.648 --> 17:00.933
Sometimes that didn't get in because I had orders 
to cut every story with my name in them. Sometimes

17:01.013 --> 17:02.716
they'll attack me. I'd say it wouldn't be in the 
Texas paper. The general orders, cut your

17:05.239 --> 17:06.841
articles. Some didn't take the trouble to read it 
and discriminate. Just don't give them any

17:09.324 --> 17:11.106
publicity. I talked to the Wall Street reporter 
man in Washington one time after I'd been there

17:11.747 --> 17:21.619
some years, about 10 years, I said, see, your paper 
amazes me. You're supposed to be in the paper with

17:21.879 --> 17:25.744
big money and wealth and everything in the 
country. I get a fair shake out of Wall Street

17:26.197 --> 17:31.643
Journal than I do any big daily newspaper in Texas. 
How do you explain that? He said, we're

17:35.186 --> 17:37.549
non-political. The people that we give the people 
the news, what happens. And we figure they're

17:42.714 --> 17:49.180
intelligent enough to make their judgment on 
that, who they want to support and not support. We

17:49.200 --> 17:50.282
tell them what he's doing. We try to write him a 
portion of what's actually happening. Ours is a

17:56.200 --> 17:58.183
financial paper. It's not trying to pump one 
party, one person against the other. It's lay it

18:01.527 --> 18:04.231
all out there and let the people judge. And the 
financials of the people that are able to buy, do

18:04.271 --> 18:12.483
buy the Wall Street Journal, we think have been 
close enough to face certain judgment. We believe

18:12.583 --> 18:14.125
in keeping them informed. And the result was I had 
some very friendly articles from Boyle Street

18:15.151 --> 18:21.304
Journal for my big ticket bill. No big newspaper in 
Texas would write an article in favor of that big

18:21.865 --> 18:26.654
ticket bill, not a one. Now when I had the Padre 
Island-Niceman seashore bill, I had three papers

18:27.276 --> 18:35.252
help me, the Texas Observer here, The Corpus 
Christi Caller Times and the Houston Press. It was

18:38.514 --> 18:43.762
a Scripps-Howard paper in Houston that later went 
under and was absorbed by one of the other two.

18:43.862 --> 18:45.785
There used to be three dailies there. As the three 
papers, one was this observer that comes out a

18:45.805 --> 18:53.075
couple times a month, and two dailies supported 
the Padre Island. The Guadalupe Mountain was

18:53.676 --> 18:55.899
better supported. That was far out in West Texas, 
and the West Texans wanted some of that. At the

18:59.887 --> 19:04.493
Corpus Christi, Colder Times, Fort Worth, 
Star-Telegram, and others were pumping for it. It

19:04.513 --> 19:09.839
wasn't as hard to get as the Pottery Isle bill. But 
the Big Thicket, Time Life, the most profitable

19:09.959 --> 19:20.652
operation of Time Life is not for the 
mini-magazines in St. Francis or the

19:09.959 --> 19:20.652
recreational places they have around the world. 
Their biggest income is from those fine

19:20.672 --> 19:27.801
plantations down in the Big Thicket, and they were 
cutting the weight. First, the Dallas News wrote

19:28.388 --> 19:33.816
an article at the beginning before that for the big 
ticket. Maybe one other paper. They soon quit. We

19:35.999 --> 19:37.340
can see what was happening. They would tell them, 
here, you are going to run the price of folk paper up

19:37.360 --> 19:45.572
here if you let us continue the operation of that 
Acor's operation. And already out of 3 and 1 half

19:45.592 --> 19:49.618
million, there wasn't but about 300,000 acres 
left. We got a measly 85,000, 84,550 acres in the

19:50.058 --> 19:55.746
park. That's all to say they're butchering it now. 
The

20:01.115 --> 20:10.563
Secretary of Interior and all just giving permits 
to any driller that wants to go in there and drill

20:01.115 --> 20:10.563
those. The oil was reserved. The oil was reserved 
to the landowners. But we proved at the hearings

20:16.849 --> 20:23.034
it's perfectly feasible if there's oil under that 
to drill it by slant hole drilling. And I was down

20:23.054 --> 20:26.037
there at a big thicket association meeting here 
this past winter, and had a meeting there honoring

20:26.455 --> 20:36.044
Arthur Fullenkamp, who's dead now, who was a great 
protagonist of the Big Thicket. His paper, the

20:36.064 --> 20:38.927
Coombs name, said it was red oil over Texas. He had 
to sign the big double barrel shotgun, the editor

20:39.487 --> 20:45.393
filed fourth barrel. And he did. He scorched them. 
He scorched them. We'd reproduce it and mail it

20:47.956 --> 20:50.078
over to Texas. And they fight for the Big Thicket. 
And so that

20:55.345 --> 21:07.260
fight there, there's nobody left to attack that. 
What they're doing, what the former Secretary of

21:07.340 --> 21:13.949
the Interior said, that a lot of these areas should 
be reseeded to the states. They're not worthy of

21:14.029 --> 21:16.612
being a national park area. So if they butcher that 
enough, what they plan to do is give it back, reseed

21:16.632 --> 21:22.500
Texas and its legislature up here, there'd be 
probably some broken legs trying to outrun each

21:22.835 --> 21:28.003
other to give it back to the lumber companies. It'd 
be a great danger hurting somebody if they rushed

21:28.023 --> 21:34.392
to vote for it to give it back. What do you see as the 
future of the Democratic Party, primarily here in

21:34.412 --> 21:41.422
Texas, but also throughout the United States? I 
see the Democratic Party to be very much stronger

21:42.824 --> 21:49.394
in 1986 than it was in 1984. Now, Reagan did not get 
all this vote that he got on personal popularity. I

21:54.570 --> 21:58.796
think the press has wholly misprinted that and 
maybe didn't know. I don't mean they deliberately

21:58.896 --> 22:01.560
lied about it. They just looked the surface thing 
at Humphrey. Democrats are unpopular. The

22:06.506 --> 22:10.471
Democratic Party and what it stood for was not that 
unpopular. And Humphrey wasn't. I mean, Mondale

22:12.774 --> 22:17.501
wasn't until he got up and made that acceptance 
speech and said, I'm going to raise your taxes. I

22:17.941 --> 22:19.183
went out campaigning for One day, it was the law's 
cause. Old friends have known the staunch

22:22.156 --> 22:25.581
Democrats all their life. He said he was going to 
raise our taxes. That was the thing that killed him

22:28.425 --> 22:31.629
off cold. Killed the Democratic horse. It didn't 
kill the horse, it killed the potential of

22:34.393 --> 22:37.437
winning. I think without that, that kind of 
blunders, by trying to fire Manette and put Burt

22:37.918 --> 22:48.192
Lance in, they may be an honest man, but the whole 
country regards Burt Lance as a crook. whether he

22:48.509 --> 23:13.639
is or not it was there and then later was oh and the 
big ones try to pull out to try to pull out of his uh

22:48.509 --> 23:13.639
boo-boo on the taxes later says i'm not going to 
raise any taxes for anybody that makes less than 25

22:48.509 --> 23:13.639
000 a year it'll only be those above that well 
average airline pilot in the united states

22:48.509 --> 23:13.639
average salaries are 75 000 a year steel workers 
40,000. CWA, communication workers, many of

23:15.532 --> 23:18.435
them. I expect the average is over 25. Oil, 
chemical, and atomic workers, I don't know what

23:21.079 --> 23:25.824
the average is, 35,000, 40,000. He lost 40% of 
labor. That ran off his more affluent labor

23:27.526 --> 23:32.492
workers who could have contributed to his 
campaign. He lost their support and all. So that's

23:34.595 --> 23:38.400
the reason that Reagan got that big vote. It's one 
reason. Those politicians in Washington are

23:39.741 --> 23:42.344
smart enough and worked it. They haven't so much 
trouble with In Congress now, though, he's got

23:43.994 --> 23:57.375
enough bull weevils from Republicans in the House 
to pass his legislation, and they know it's an

23:43.994 --> 23:57.375
abomination, what he's trying to do to the poor 
people, the child support for the... He's cutting

23:57.455 --> 24:12.178
all the... What he reminds me of more than anything 
was Hitler prior to World War II when he was cutting

23:57.455 --> 24:12.178
all domestic programs in Europe and building up 
the most powerful offensive war machine in the

23:57.455 --> 24:12.178
history of the human race up to that time. Reagan's 
following the same pattern, build up a powerful,

24:12.547 --> 24:25.846
it's got the most powerful war machine in the 
world, make it stronger, have the most powerful

24:12.547 --> 24:25.846
war machine in the world, cut all these domestic 
forces and push that back, which is pushing

24:12.547 --> 24:25.846
civilization back. There were... Wait just a 
minute.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.967
There were... 1978, there were 24 million people 
in the poverty bracket in America. Five years

24:47.594 --> 24:50.758
later, under Reaganomics, 35 million. And if you 
had an old one, back here when there were, the

24:51.659 --> 25:01.593
number below the poverty level was 39 million when 
Kennedy won. By the time the Republicans came in,

25:02.174 --> 25:06.079
they had it reduced to 25 million. And that 25 
million had the percent below the poverty level

25:11.525 --> 25:14.768
The anti-poverty bills did not fail. They 
succeeded wonderfully. We've had nothing but a

25:16.669 --> 25:24.956
barrage of propaganda since Nixon went in to the 
present that all this was a failure,

25:16.669 --> 25:24.956
well-intentioned failure. It succeeded 
wonderfully. Here, between 60 and 70, the

25:26.478 --> 25:34.124
percentage of people below the poverty level 
reduced from 22% to 12%. It went down to 12%. Now,

25:37.287 --> 25:41.110
1983, it's back up to 15% and climbing. and 
climbing rapidly. And the number of people in that

25:42.889 --> 25:50.720
poverty bracket now are higher than they've been 
since 1960 when the Democrats won the election. 35

25:50.740 --> 25:51.401
million. That's just one in this year. You can take 
other facts after facts. Poverty by family

25:57.249 --> 25:58.831
status. Very poor. All the statistics show the 
disaster. The disaster to the people. Economics.

26:07.243 --> 26:10.287
Here is the total... I want to take taxes. 
Individual. Come here. Yeah, just let it go in

26:16.012 --> 26:17.574
here. Okay. All right. Individual, look here in 
fiscal eight before Reagan went in. Get one of

26:23.083 --> 26:25.107
these books and look at it. You get all kinds. $244 
million was the taxes paid by individuals.

26:30.275 --> 26:33.240
Corporate income tax was $64 million. Now, three 
years later, The total taxes paid to individuals,

26:35.022 --> 26:43.391
$288 million, just about 20% over that 24, not 
quite 20% increase. But corporation taxes have

26:43.411 --> 26:56.926
been cut from $64 to $37 million with the greatest 
power grabbed by big corporations grabbing over

26:43.411 --> 26:56.926
smaller than snow in American history, the 
biggest profits in American history. Look at

26:56.966 --> 27:02.532
those gross profits of General Motors and their 
taxes are cut down that way. The big rich never had

27:02.798 --> 27:05.461
such largesse before. An economist out here at the 
university has told me that never in the history of

27:05.482 --> 27:19.740
mankind has there been such a tremendous shift of 
wealth from one group to another in a nation except

27:05.482 --> 27:19.740
in time of war or revolution. But in peaceful 
means, just peaceful laws, taking it away from the

27:20.341 --> 27:27.050
middle class and investing it in the very rich. And 
if you look at the number of the income tax returns

27:27.070 --> 27:31.135
here, Is this what Reagan calls the Second 
American Revolution? Well, it is one. Yes, it's

27:37.591 --> 27:39.613
the Second American Revolution. Taking property 
from the poor and giving it to the rich. It's never

27:43.397 --> 27:45.980
happened before in our history to this extent. The 
number of returns here of people, if you add all

27:47.141 --> 27:58.333
these up, with under $25,000 a year, that's 70% of 
all income tax returns in the United States. If you

27:58.814 --> 28:01.577
take the number under $50,000 a year, and add these 
that get over $50,000, that's 7%. 93% of all the

28:05.337 --> 28:10.303
income tax returns are under $50,000. 70% under 
$25,000. And that's where you look at the millions

28:12.666 --> 28:22.739
of the number of returns and the gross income, 
where the income's coming in, in those hundreds of

28:12.666 --> 28:22.739
billions. Now, when they cut the income taxes 25%, 
if you earn under 25%, you've lost money because

28:27.393 --> 28:30.740
they've raised the local taxes. Look everywhere. 
Your school taxes and all make up for this. If

28:34.108 --> 28:37.596
you're earning under $50,000, you've probably 
lost. Probably lost. You may not. Your family

28:39.079 --> 28:41.765
situation may be such that you didn't lose. But 
generally. You've lost if you're under $50,000.

28:44.576 --> 28:47.499
That's 93% of all the returns. It's just robbing 
you of the others. And people are swallowing that

28:49.480 --> 28:54.425
because the press is big money and it's helped put 
this fake thing over. It's on myths, false myths,

28:54.445 --> 28:57.308
falsehoods. And the Democrats are so pitifully 
weak up there, they're not educating the people.

29:01.872 --> 29:03.133
They'll say it and smile. My God, you tell somebody 
he's a criminal, what district attorney could get

29:03.634 --> 29:11.541
up and convict a criminal by smiling to the jury? 
You know, when you're convicted of robbers and

29:11.808 --> 29:20.042
thieves, and you ask about this, well, old Harry 
Truman was the one who told the truth about that.

29:20.062 --> 29:28.356
Harry Truman said that in his book, Frankly 
Speaking, if you look at that paperback, it's not

29:20.062 --> 29:28.356
this exact word, but that's what it meant. That the 
only people who make money out of politics are

29:28.376 --> 29:32.683
thieves and crooks. And you can steal it or take it 
and drive it. Thieves and crooks.
