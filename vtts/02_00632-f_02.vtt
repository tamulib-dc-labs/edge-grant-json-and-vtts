WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:03.753
I can think of some reasons to live under the ocean. 
I think a great place for nightclubs, for

00:04.654 --> 00:06.777
instance. I can think of great nightclubs. 
There's a beautiful one in the Gulf of Eilat that

00:08.518 --> 00:12.443
the Israelis have. And you should sit down there 
underneath, looking up through glass windows and

00:12.463 --> 00:20.251
everything going on in that beautiful part of the 
branch of the Red Sea. I can think of condominiums

00:22.514 --> 00:30.342
for people with emphysema

00:22.514 --> 00:30.342
living under one atmosphere, extra pressure. two 
atmospheres of pressure, they could live

00:31.115 --> 00:36.742
perfectly normal lives, couldn't they? That's 
all they need. Why should people go around gasping

00:38.303 --> 00:44.791
for breath in the last 10 years of their life when 
they could live under one extra atmosphere and

00:38.303 --> 00:44.791
breathe normally?

00:48.015 --> 00:59.468
And this might be a reasonable sort of a location 
for a condominium under a couple of atmospheres of

00:48.015 --> 00:59.468
pressure down some beautiful parts of Florida 
Straits.

01:00.983 --> 01:07.530
And it makes it much easier to build and less 
dangerous if it's under water, where the pressure

01:00.983 --> 01:07.530
is equalized on the inside and outside. But as far 
as people just inhabiting the bottom of the ocean

01:09.832 --> 01:19.502
for reasons of space, I'd rather consider taking 
Jupiter apart and making some more planets. I

01:19.602 --> 01:20.723
think that's more feasible.

01:23.846 --> 01:25.027
That's a big engineering job. You can make dozens 
and dozens of planets.

01:33.012 --> 02:01.112
i'd

01:33.012 --> 02:01.112
like to be around for that one by the way well maybe 
you don't want to do that maybe you want to do is just

01:33.012 --> 02:01.112
add a little bit to mars from jupiter you see to make 
it more habitable

01:33.012 --> 02:01.112
real chemical engineering job too changing that 
ammonia and something else getting water and so on

01:33.012 --> 02:01.112
getting a decent atmosphere were you surprised by 
the way with reports coming back from Mars in terms

02:01.312 --> 02:07.058
of the satellite pictures or the landing pictures 
we're receiving now? I've been in Baja

02:07.619 --> 02:09.000
California. I've been looking at Martian 
landscape for quite a while down there. But what

02:12.104 --> 02:13.065
are these like? They're boulder-strewn, aren't 
they? They're boulder-strewn and the

02:14.286 --> 02:17.790
possibility that many of them are cut by water. Oh, 
yeah, sure. Well, obviously Mars has its ice caps

02:19.592 --> 02:24.417
of some sort. It has water or some condensable 
fluid, has some condensable gas, and it certainly

02:25.443 --> 02:35.175
probably had more in the past. No, I don't think I 
was particularly surprised. Not that I was

02:40.842 --> 02:51.355
believing the canals of Mars, but

02:40.842 --> 02:51.355
I think it's perfectly real. What I was really 
surprised on at was the surface of Venus. I mean, it

02:57.796 --> 03:12.597
really didn't occur to me, or I guess anybody else, 
that with such a dense atmosphere as Venus, and

02:57.796 --> 03:12.597
even with such tremendously high wind 
velocities, that the boundary layers should be so

02:57.796 --> 03:12.597
thick that there was no wind at the surface, you 
see, essentially windless at the surface. I think

03:12.617 --> 03:13.658
that was strange.

03:20.608 --> 03:20.748
Oh. I... I wanted to ask you two or three questions 
about aquaculture. Do you see the future in

03:28.110 --> 03:39.405
aquaculture and such things as planned oyster 
beds, or do you see it in terms of mining what we

03:28.110 --> 03:39.405
always classified before as seaweeds, or both?

03:43.570 --> 03:47.695
Well, you know, we start out with I was thinking 
we've just thought of agriculture. Of course,

03:51.866 --> 03:57.291
every place in the world other than the United 
States has conducted it for a long time. Japanese,

03:57.652 --> 04:00.855
there's tremendous industries all through 
Indonesia. Almost everybody in the world knows

04:01.756 --> 04:05.440
more about agriculture than we do. We start out as 
though now we're going to solve all these

04:06.160 --> 04:10.085
problems. I was looking at East Pakistan, and East 
Pakistan produces in its ponds. Now, this is

04:15.850 --> 04:17.252
freshwater. Ponds and bills. And about as much, 
about fish, that little country produced about as

04:19.045 --> 04:31.119
much fish as a third of the U.S. catch, just from its 
ponds and fields. Oh, it's essentially cultured.

04:34.908 --> 04:38.351
Well, hell, everybody knows more about this than 
we do. And so I'm not quite sure what you mean when

04:38.371 --> 04:42.235
you ask me about a future of it. If you ask me, is the 
United States going to learn from anybody, I'm not

04:42.856 --> 04:46.480
so sure. They're going to go through all the 
difficulties of trying to solve the problems all

04:46.500 --> 04:50.223
by themselves. They're going to make it so 
expensive that the only thing that can possibly be

04:50.644 --> 05:00.954
used is high luxury food that has nothing to do 
about the impact of protein food on the world's

04:50.644 --> 05:00.954
supply, as far as I can see. Now, it does seem to me 
that we're trying to jump, if you look at You're an

05:05.198 --> 05:33.180
agricultural historian, and I may be quite wrong 
about this history, but it seems to me like there's

05:05.198 --> 05:33.180
a sequential series from the hunting economy to 
the gathering economy to what I would call a ranch

05:05.198 --> 05:33.180
where you use preferred herbivores to crop the 
land with their own energy to the farm in which you

05:05.198 --> 05:33.180
start to raise the supplies for your domestic 
animals. to the battery culture in which you bring

05:34.240 --> 05:41.871
food in to immobilized or essentially 
immobilized creatures from whatever worldwide

05:34.240 --> 05:41.871
sources are necessary. Now, we're immediately 
leaping to that last step, the battery culture.

05:49.201 --> 05:50.984
But ocean is a poor environment. It's a thin broth 
that has trace. The food is highly dispersed in a

05:55.029 --> 05:57.373
dense medium. It's a million times more dilute 
than, say, a grass field, a field of grass. A

06:03.164 --> 06:07.049
million times more to lose.

06:08.311 --> 06:14.279
Traditionally, and even today, in modern 
society, where you have a poor environment, you

06:08.311 --> 06:14.279
use ranging techniques. You send your preferred 
creature out onto this. You don't use diesel oil.

06:18.685 --> 06:23.911
You do a little bit of diesel oil to cultivate or 
gather food and bring it into them. You let them

06:23.931 --> 06:31.922
burn some part of the crop that's sparsely 
distributed out here, and then you have a roundup.

06:32.189 --> 06:37.678
You bring them back in some way and have made some 
net gain. Well, one interesting thing you have in

06:37.698 --> 06:45.792
the ocean is this number of species that will round 
themselves up, all the anadromous fishes, the

06:37.698 --> 06:45.792
ones that come in and spawn. And some of these are 
primitive feeders. Some of the shads, the hilsa,

06:48.878 --> 06:57.893
the Indian shad, is a particularly fine food fish. 
So it seems to me like a sensible step would really

06:58.345 --> 07:01.750
be ranging. That is, you culture a population 
which you now turn loose in a thin environment to

07:01.830 --> 07:09.702
graze it and then to return to you, you see. And you 
can do some predator control and maybe some

07:10.623 --> 07:19.897
seeding of sorts, just essentially the way you do 
it in rangeland management, essentially the same

07:10.623 --> 07:19.897
sort of level. But our effort here is to or leap all 
of these steps that we've taken 3,000 years to go

07:20.478 --> 07:27.188
through on land. And go right to battery culture. 
Well, I don't know. The problems, obviously, of

07:31.791 --> 07:41.085
animal husbandry, once you get to these more 
concentrated levels, has totally been a disease.

07:41.706 --> 07:43.929
And we have spent a tremendous lot of time. It's a 
disease of any concentration of organism. And

07:48.015 --> 07:53.884
we've spent a lot of time solving this in the case of 
our preferred species on land. Each one of these

07:54.657 --> 08:00.444
organisms in the ocean is going to have a series of 
disasters. We try battery culture. Exactly the

08:02.647 --> 08:05.851
same nature, I think. One new disease after 
another.

08:10.877 --> 08:13.561
And all the immunization, all the research that 
has to go behind it. But in the United States, I

08:14.262 --> 08:17.426
don't think we'll progress beyond luxury food. 
Because it's not necessary for us to increase the

08:19.528 --> 08:22.572
protein supply that much? Well, I think the 
increased protein supply around the world, and

08:24.813 --> 08:30.660
Ravel may have talked to you about this, is 
something of a delusion anyway. But actually, the

08:31.221 --> 08:40.872
world is equally short on fats and oils, probably 
more limiting nutrient. But no, because we'll

08:40.892 --> 08:47.800
make things too expensive.

08:48.286 --> 08:59.359
Every time we build a lobster industry, we'll have 
to build a sewage disposal plant just to get rid of

08:48.286 --> 08:59.359
the seawater that it went through, and so on, that 
went through that lobster culture, and so forth.

08:59.379 --> 09:05.166
Then just the manpower involved in things is going 
to make it impossible to culture anything except

08:59.379 --> 09:05.166
luxury species. I think we'll find out some 
interesting things. OK. But the ranging of using

09:12.029 --> 09:25.097
some sort of primitive feeder like shad to go forth 
into the ocean and concentrate this thin soup of

09:12.029 --> 09:25.097
the ocean and bring it back to us, now that seems to 
be a much more viable approach. But you don't think

09:25.177 --> 09:26.420
we'll choose? I don't think we'll choose, no.

09:41.999 --> 09:48.514
I want you to describe how fish population 
histories can be inferred from fish scales found

09:41.999 --> 09:48.514
in sediments. No. I wasn't sure I understood that. 
And what ecological and evolutionary

09:51.982 --> 09:56.312
implications does this technique have? Well, 
it's somewhat unlimited, I think, eventually.

10:01.052 --> 10:03.515
But let me describe the technique to start with. In 
a few places, the ocean bottom is continuously

10:03.555 --> 10:19.137
building up, as you know, and continuously moving 
and doing all these things that we've begun to

10:03.555 --> 10:19.137
understand from seafloor spreading and 
continental drift. But in a few places around the

10:19.157 --> 10:26.046
world, the bottom waters in Usually in near shore 
basins are anaerobic or anoxic. They have no

10:30.734 --> 10:31.515
oxygen. And nothing lives there. Even though over 
most of the ocean, the sediments are raining down

10:34.078 --> 10:40.105
every year. There are things living there that mix 
them up. And so the time resolution that you can get

10:43.028 --> 10:48.675
is of the order of 10,000 years at the best. The 
sediments are mixed continuously. But in these

10:52.732 --> 10:56.856
regions, they're laid down in layers that you can 
identify year by year. You can put your finger on it

10:57.677 --> 11:02.822
and say, within a few years, that year is the year 
zero right there. That's what the sediments were

11:02.902 --> 11:08.148
laid down in the year zero. As you go back in time, it 
becomes somewhat less certain. But you can just

11:10.150 --> 11:11.151
count back. And you can check your count with 
radioactive dating.

11:17.242 --> 11:27.793
Such sediments exist on land, the whole Monterey 
formation, and you can split it open and you can see

11:17.242 --> 11:27.793
peppered with fish scales and other kinds of 
debris, diatoms, foraminifera. So you know

11:28.734 --> 11:40.887
something in that year of what the Pacific was 
doing, or what the ocean was doing, and something

11:28.734 --> 11:40.887
about what fish were present, you see. Because you 
can identify these scales. You can date these

11:43.387 --> 11:44.489
scales. You can tell how old they were and how fast 
they were growing. You know what species it was.

11:49.256 --> 11:51.980
You know how old the fish was and how fast it had 
grown. So you know a great deal. And you know it for

11:53.442 --> 11:57.488
that year, exactly. Well, the kind of Rosetta 
Stone in this whole business is, of course, if you

11:57.508 --> 12:04.599
try this, how well does this agree to the known 
history? And when we went through that exercise,

12:06.181 --> 12:10.688
we found it agreed very well with the known 
history. where we really know what the

12:11.309 --> 12:33.300
populations of the pelagic fish are out here, our 
results from looking at these sediments and

12:11.309 --> 12:33.300
analyzing the number of scales per year coming 
down, totally independently, gives us the same

12:11.309 --> 12:33.300
curve of the variation between the number of hake, 
the number of anchovies, the number of saris, and

12:11.309 --> 12:33.300
the number of sardines. This gives us confidence 
we can make these same kind of counts back into the

12:34.175 --> 12:42.126
past, as far as we want, and see what has been the 
relationship between these fish. And what we find

12:43.548 --> 12:45.511
is something very surprising. We find that the 
sardine, which was the dominant pelagic fish here

12:46.672 --> 13:03.135
when man first started his fisheries, has never 
been here for long periods of time, but only for

12:46.672 --> 13:03.135
short bursts, maybe eight times in the last 1,600 
years has it been here in quantity. The anchovy,

13:04.027 --> 13:07.711
however, has been here continuously over the 
whole time. So it's really quite an interesting

13:09.494 --> 13:11.316
picture. And my earlier parts of my conversation, 
when I said society seemed to be unable to act on

13:13.198 --> 13:20.507
information, this is very powerful information. 
You would really never have expected to have such a

13:20.547 --> 13:32.802
real insight into the way these species 
interacted in the past and what their natural

13:20.547 --> 13:32.802
abundance was and how it fluctuated. And now to 
conceive that a fishery on the Anchovy, a species

13:33.592 --> 13:53.440
that has maintained a sizable population here for 
at least the last 1600 years, would be the same as a

13:33.592 --> 13:53.440
fishery on the sardine, a species that was never 
able to maintain a sizable population here for

13:33.592 --> 13:53.440
more than 40 or 50 or 80 years at a time. and then only 
a few periods, is asinine. I mean, you couldn't

13:58.364 --> 14:04.350
expect it to have the same result, fishery on a 
transient species and fishery on a permanent

13:58.364 --> 14:04.350
species.

14:07.734 --> 14:19.447
So in my earlier remarks, I said I thought we had 
gotten exquisite answers on some of these

14:07.734 --> 14:19.447
problems that society had enunciated as a 
worthwhile problem to work on. And yet the

14:19.467 --> 14:22.110
disappointment is, of course, Not that they don't 
act on this, but they don't consider it even in

14:22.360 --> 14:27.665
their actions, just to reiterate. Okay. All 
right. What about in terms of evolutionary

14:31.989 --> 14:34.551
implications? Do you foresee being able to see the 
evolution in general of fishes and fish species

14:34.611 --> 14:42.398
from this kind of...? Oh, well, of course, that's 
the traditional way of going, because their

14:42.419 --> 14:49.465
10,000-year resolution has no particular 
consequence. but to see the interrelationships

14:50.272 --> 14:55.882
between the microorganisms, for instance. So we 
know how the Pacific was behaving when the sardine

14:56.163 --> 15:03.497
was here, and how it behaved when they changed from 
one species to another. We'll eventually know

15:03.517 --> 15:13.275
what environmental conditions mediated these 
shifts between species, because we can see how

15:03.517 --> 15:13.275
much mid-Pacific influence there was, how strong 
the California current was, how much subtropical

15:13.829 --> 15:21.077
water was flowing up, how strong was the 
countercurrent. And do this on a year-by-year

15:21.637 --> 15:23.459
basis. That's a huge job. We have to identify all 
the diatoms and foraminifera in these little thin

15:25.982 --> 15:35.412
layers, seven-tenths of a millimeter thick. But 
you see, if we now go to a place like the

15:35.432 --> 15:43.380
Bay of Bengal, And the Indians are going to start a 
fishery, say, on their astrology. Wouldn't it be a

15:49.105 --> 15:53.791
wonderful thing to be able to tell them, is that a 
permanent species here? Is it occasionally

15:54.172 --> 15:56.355
replaced by others? Is it just a transient 
species? How steady is the population? How steady

15:59.639 --> 16:01.441
has it been for 10,000 years? These are big answers 
for people who want to guide their fisheries in

16:02.222 --> 16:05.827
some rational way.

16:10.033 --> 16:10.093
OK.

16:18.022 --> 16:24.348
Would you judge us to be proceeding cautiously 
enough or not cautiously enough in developing the

16:18.022 --> 16:24.348
sea? What do you mean by us? Well, us as Americans. 
Would you encourage us to exercise more caution or

16:29.653 --> 16:33.898
less caution? I think caution is the wrong word 
there. I would advise us to use more rationality.

16:40.604 --> 16:43.607
Caution is really totally the wrong word.

16:48.177 --> 16:55.626
For example, the whole matter of domestic waste 
disposal in the ocean. What do you want to call

16:56.207 --> 16:57.709
caution there? Caution is putting out a billion 
dollars in Los Angeles to build tertiary

16:59.651 --> 17:07.521
treatment plants, is it? $200, $300, $500 per 
capita when we have so many social needs? Is that

17:15.691 --> 17:16.632
caution? No, all the evidence is the ocean is 
perfectly confident to absorb these kind of

17:17.050 --> 17:21.195
wastes. That's its business, absorbing organic 
material. So I'm not quite sure what's causing it.

17:26.923 --> 17:28.505
Rationality is the word. Yes, we need a great deal 
more, a great deal more. We need people other than

17:33.912 --> 17:39.038
Cousteau advising the government on what to do. He 
has reasons to scare people to death.

17:45.486 --> 17:45.927
Which are? funds for his institution. It's going 
to be extremely costly to society as a whole. It

17:55.888 --> 17:58.452
doesn't take a balanced viewpoint. There's 
pictures of us climbing to the highest mountain

17:58.952 --> 18:09.147
tops and clutching our throats because we're 
dying in oxia because we've killed all the

17:58.952 --> 18:09.147
phytoplankton. No evidence. No evidence. Now, 
what do you see your role in the future of

18:12.952 --> 18:15.636
oceanography? How do you perceive yourself in in 
the coming future? Well, I'd like to know. I have no

18:20.990 --> 18:21.851
idea. I've always been enthusiastic

18:21.871 --> 18:34.486
and melioristic, I guess is the word. Somewhere 
between optimistic and pessimistic. I think

18:38.251 --> 18:43.577
melioristic is optimism, but only you have to do 
something about it and just have it happen. I've,

18:45.820 --> 18:47.622
to some real degree, right at the moment lost 
confidence that events can be influenced very

18:48.395 --> 18:55.385
promptly.

18:59.010 --> 19:06.861
But our political system is such that it really is 
not able to respond to the evidence.

19:09.445 --> 19:15.814
It's acclimation,

19:09.445 --> 19:15.814
government by acclimation of some sort. A 
politician moves the beat. causes the least stir

19:18.736 --> 19:24.144
in some way, gets the fewest people mad at him. And I 
really think maybe we just can't act this way. Now,

19:29.132 --> 19:31.055
maybe we can afford not to act this way. We can 
afford to put an extra billion dollars in sewer

19:31.816 --> 19:40.069
plants in every major city along the coast for no 
purpose.

19:41.095 --> 19:42.056
And maybe we need to. Maybe it's the WPA of sorts. 
Maybe it's the science that we've worked on as a WPA

19:43.698 --> 19:47.501
of sorts at a higher level. Maybe the WPA concept 
has evolved so that I'm nothing but a WPA worker

19:47.541 --> 19:58.952
making bridges in some unknown creek in some 
unknown mountain that will never be seen again. I

19:58.972 --> 20:10.123
dislike thinking this, but I'm beginning to 
wonder if the WPA concept hasn't spread quite a

19:58.972 --> 20:10.123
bit. It worries me to see this wake of scientists 
who have tried to serve this country and unable to

20:10.863 --> 20:22.075
serve it. A great number of people that worked on 
desalination just announced today that

20:23.336 --> 20:37.932
something you knew 20 years ago when the 
desalination program on the OSW was established,

20:23.336 --> 20:37.932
that it was impossible to do this for agricultural 
water. And you could make that calculation in an

20:38.373 --> 20:40.515
instant. At that time, you knew that if the ocean 
were freshwater, that is, if it were given to you at

20:42.368 --> 20:51.618
sea level, it would have very little effect on our 
utilization of water in these United States. It's

20:51.898 --> 20:52.919
too big a continent.

20:56.443 --> 21:01.068
But

20:56.443 --> 21:01.068
I'm not a bit sure. I came to the conclusion that 
Israel was full of smart people. They had reason to

21:07.475 --> 21:10.418
be conservative with their resources. They're 
screwed up as we are. They've brought our culture

21:12.116 --> 21:13.838
there anyway. They are a piece of the United 
States, more or less. They have the same screw-up

21:16.181 --> 21:19.024
as we have. So I'm not quite sure. Mexico? Mexico 
looks pretty good, I think. They don't

21:24.550 --> 21:26.452
necessarily follow the tradition. They can have 
their micro-ondas instead of stringing copper

21:27.513 --> 21:34.740
wires around forever because Anaconda insists on 
it or whatever. They can have their communication

21:34.801 --> 21:40.827
system by some totally modern approach. rather 
than by the conventional ones. Can they conduct a

21:43.987 --> 21:45.389
fishery that way? Yes. These are the countries 
that are going to maybe profit from this research.

21:50.797 --> 21:53.101
They're starting an anchovy fishery. And they're 
going to start it on the basis of the data we've got

21:53.121 --> 21:57.447
to try to help the people of California. Well,

21:58.068 --> 22:02.996
survival is the fittest. I think the same old laws 
still act. Are you still intimately involved, by

22:07.943 --> 22:10.307
the way, with Israel? I don't know what you mean, 
intimately. We're putting a breakwater over

22:12.809 --> 22:14.150
there. Yeah. I mean, is that process still going 
on? Oh, sure. Okay. Yeah. Sure. They're bright

22:19.816 --> 22:22.858
people, but they're screwed up also. They have 
their own political system that's copied much

22:23.299 --> 22:28.143
after ours. They also can't do the rational thing. 
What role do you see for Scripps' institution in

22:34.709 --> 22:39.754
the future of oceanography? Oh, well, I think 
Scripps will be a leader for a long time. He'll be a

22:44.743 --> 22:48.027
leader for the simple reason that there are a lot of 
bright people here. There's a foreseeable

22:49.829 --> 22:50.971
future. I think that it has to avoid getting into 
huge projects which totally dominate it in any

22:51.211 --> 22:58.900
way. Say, for instance, the Sary project. It 
certainly may have a role in that. I think it's

23:06.008 --> 23:16.924
unhealthy for very large projects to dominate an 
institution like this, unless they're very

23:06.008 --> 23:16.924
highly generalized ones. I think it should have a 
better role somehow in advising the government.

23:23.494 --> 23:31.206
I've been looking at a series of reports lately

23:23.494 --> 23:31.206
in which we really act Now, I collect together 
various groups of scientists as rather fixed

23:31.861 --> 23:43.573
panels to review various research projects, 
various proposals, and really criticize them.

23:43.593 --> 23:49.199
And I think that's having a salutary influence. I 
think that's working rather well. But it's a

23:50.941 --> 23:52.242
rather small scale. I think maybe that's the way 
one might act. Really get competent people

23:55.806 --> 23:57.868
together So when Lockheed or API or somebody like 
that has a big project, there is a competent review

23:58.540 --> 24:21.679
by competent scientists that are undertaken to 
really see if it makes sense so that you don't get in

23:58.540 --> 24:21.679
this funny situation of they're still dealing 
with small-scale hydrodynamics when it's really

23:58.540 --> 24:21.679
very large-scale hydrodynamics.

24:25.658 --> 24:34.810
that the role of oceanography, or research in 
oceanography, if I may use that word, or

24:25.658 --> 24:34.810
development of the oceans is explosive.

24:37.273 --> 24:52.493
I think that it still suffers, like most research 
in the United States, from the final and

24:37.273 --> 24:52.493
enveloping shock wave of Alamogordo, which is, if 
you throw enough money at it, you can solve it. That

24:54.835 --> 24:58.623
was foreseeable, wasn't it? You put a billion 
dollars in, you released this vast amount of

24:58.643 --> 25:01.549
energy. But somehow, the important thing is that I 
remember the days when I was peripherally

25:03.454 --> 25:14.818
associated with these great men who were 
responsible for nuclear energy. Karam, Gamow,

25:16.503 --> 25:19.527
Fermi, all these people. And I remember the 
excitement there was at that time. Here was really

25:22.031 --> 25:24.935
the new world, Columbus entering the new world. 
Many ideas. Nobody had the idea it was going to be

25:26.938 --> 25:34.649
just nuclear reactors in the conventional time. 
Today, there were all kinds of ideas of how you use

25:34.669 --> 25:41.599
this nuclear energy, including plowshare, just 
as an explosive. We've kind of lost that sense of

25:42.862 --> 25:44.504
adventure. Everybody's treading too lightly. 
Somebody else is going to have to do it. French,

25:48.128 --> 25:49.510
possibly. I don't know. They seem more 
adventurous right now. They have a different kind

25:52.774 --> 25:54.376
of a government, too. Forty people can argue about 
something on forty sides rather than twenty on two

25:55.578 --> 26:02.586
sides.

26:06.651 --> 26:12.278
All kinds of viewpoints can be raised in a 
Napoleonic society that can't be raised on in a

26:13.051 --> 26:23.362
common law, English common law society, just 
because of the influence, I think, of our

26:13.051 --> 26:23.362
judiciary system.

26:26.365 --> 26:27.847
The influence of our judiciary system? Of our 
judiciary system, our advocative system. Oh, OK.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.632
All right.

26:34.774 --> 26:35.695
Then you conceive? It's a curious output, as I 
understand it. And you probably know much more

26:38.157 --> 26:42.602
about this, and your wife probably knows more than 
you do about it. it seems to me that a result of the

26:43.105 --> 27:08.083
napoleonic system is you try to get at the truth not 
just this is the the gray area is considered the

26:43.105 --> 27:08.083
pros and cons it's a court of equity rather than a 
court of law if i use these terms correctly in the

26:43.105 --> 27:08.083
united states all these things are decided as 
though they were court of law either right or wrong

26:43.105 --> 27:08.083
one or the other science isn't that way
