WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:26.646
We were talking about the second method course 
that we have and I was telling you that in that one we

00:01.803 --> 00:26.646
cover about five, six different topics and one is 
the land use transportation methods and it's a

00:01.803 --> 00:26.646
little perhaps mathematical and theoretical but 
the intention is that to cover the concepts which

00:26.626 --> 00:31.314
would be helpful for planners to understand the 
urban and especially the regional area. By

00:31.454 --> 00:34.058
regional, I mean like Dallas-Fort Worth region. I 
don't mean big regions like Texas, etc. And I found

00:37.464 --> 00:45.938
out that that is very much helpful for planners to 
go through that exposition to understand all

00:37.464 --> 00:45.938
those theories. And then another topic of 
importance is evaluation we go through the

00:52.090 --> 01:09.306
basically cost benefit type of things and we have 
exercises to do and in fact the planning related

00:52.090 --> 01:09.306
exercise to go through I think that's very 
important for them to basically to be exposed to

01:09.286 --> 01:18.326
Then we have population and employment 
projection methods, which I think any planner

01:09.286 --> 01:18.326
should be able to do rough calculation of the 
projection of what's going to happen in the

01:09.286 --> 01:18.326
future. Do you use cohort? The cohort survival and 
also the trend analysis of linear trend, curve

01:21.373 --> 01:27.065
linear trends, etc. Their formulation, how to do 
it. In fact, there is an assignment for them to do

01:28.709 --> 01:32.857
that, to do these type of things. Do they do it by 
hand, or do they use a computer program? No, in this

01:37.305 --> 01:39.089
course, no computer. Computer is mostly in the 
statistics course, and they do basically... I

01:43.317 --> 01:49.268
have cut all the proofs, et cetera, in the 
statistics course, as basically to... I'm

01:49.288 --> 01:50.751
presenting them where... the conceptual things 
that in my mind they need to know but there are five

01:51.372 --> 02:15.304
major computer assignments that they put 
together data and basically starting from the

01:51.372 --> 02:15.304
simplest one they do one by one and get to the 
regression assignment which is the most complex

01:51.372 --> 02:15.304
one and then we repeat the regression assignment 
also in the second method course as just the review

02:15.284 --> 02:44.464
just again because of my own view that I think 
regression is the most applied and close to

02:15.284 --> 02:44.464
planning and can be applied and they put together 
some planning related one in the second course and

02:15.284 --> 02:44.464
basically do that here they learn both a major 
statistical package computer package both

02:15.284 --> 02:44.464
courses I mean and also they go and apply that so 
hopefully they're gonna become efficient with

02:15.284 --> 02:44.464
that but then rest of the course all the 
assignments are manual like that population

02:45.035 --> 03:14.991
projection one is a manual one and then the 
evaluation one which is a major development case

02:45.035 --> 03:14.991
in the downtown and they're going to evaluate to 
see if does it work to make to basically build it it

02:45.035 --> 03:14.991
is for cities like a parking structure or 
something a feasibility study basically to see is

02:45.035 --> 03:14.991
it beneficial for them to they have a piece of land 
and they're gonna see that if it is good for them to

02:45.035 --> 03:14.991
build a big parking structure public parking or 
would be better for them to sell to someone else to

03:14.971 --> 03:30.887
make an office building or whatever something 
like that but there's so many issues involved like

03:14.971 --> 03:30.887
transportation they have a rail system coming and 
the benefit of putting a parking here versus

03:14.971 --> 03:30.887
reducing the rail, transit riders, etc. Then we 
have overview of shift and share and input output,

03:34.112 --> 03:44.707
those type of regional economic analysis that I 
thought the concepts is necessary for them. We

03:45.428 --> 03:56.183
have review of linear programming in a sense that 
linear programming in some senses are exactly

03:45.428 --> 03:56.183
planning because you want to maximize the 
benefits to the society under given such

03:56.163 --> 04:00.931
constants, and that is basically the definition 
of planning. And then you have a methodology that

04:01.312 --> 04:04.016
basically does that. Again, we don't want to make 
them applied linear programmers or something. We

04:08.985 --> 04:15.977
just want them to know that there is such a concept 
very similar to planning and a basic mathematical

04:08.985 --> 04:15.977
concept that can be done. There are a bunch of these 
type of small methods. I have written a small

04:19.858 --> 04:23.742
paper, which unfortunately I haven't been able to 
publish that. We're basically going through my

04:23.762 --> 04:28.747
philosophy of the method courses for planning. If 
you are interested, I can provide you with a copy.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.332
Yeah, I'd like that very much. I used to teach the 
course in methods and techniques at A&M.

04:40.259 --> 04:43.062
So here is another architect teaching. It was a 
course that I came to enjoy, but I was backed into it

04:43.598 --> 04:52.792
because no one else wanted to teach it. And so I had 
to become familiar with demographic forecasting

04:54.214 --> 05:03.989
and different economic-based theories and 
whatnot. And then, of course, we got computers in

05:04.009 --> 05:08.656
our department. Everybody thought that we should 
get computerized in that course. which I was

05:13.147 --> 05:39.238
reluctant to do because I felt that the students 
should know how to do this by hand, and that

05:13.147 --> 05:39.238
particularly with the cohort survival 
technique, that they might lose one of the

05:13.147 --> 05:39.238
essential attributes of the technique in not 
cranking in changes in migration rates by cohort

05:39.674 --> 05:57.091
or survival rates or whatever, and that they would 
just simply punch a button and the computer would

05:39.674 --> 05:57.091
assume everything would stay the same and it would 
grind out numbers, which is exactly what happened

05:39.674 --> 05:57.091
after I was almost forced to go to computer on it by 
outside pressures in the department. So it

05:58.452 --> 06:09.563
happened, and I predicted it would, and I think 
that it was a mistake to do that. the computers to be

06:09.661 --> 06:28.868
used at all, I think it should be at the end of the 
semester where it's a hands-on sort of thing and

06:09.661 --> 06:28.868
the students are required to make changes in 
migration rights and birth and death rates and so

06:09.661 --> 06:28.868
forth. cohort and by time increment. You know, I 
don't use computer in that course exactly for,

06:33.780 --> 06:50.772
partly for that reason and partly because up to now 
there is no good packages available to do that, to

06:33.780 --> 06:50.772
do gravity model, to do land use model, etc. And 
even if become available, I guess that would be

06:51.308 --> 06:57.927
another course that, OK, we covered the theory. 
Now let us go and do applied in the computer.

07:02.952 --> 07:06.216
Personally, I don't want to spend time of learning 
those computer things. Every day, they are

07:06.396 --> 07:08.539
changing all these packages. But I guess if ever I 
was forced to do the same way, I'd have to do

07:09.140 --> 07:14.947
something about it. I think for us as the planners, 
it's more important to understand the concepts.

07:18.971 --> 07:23.737
And if we really need to use it, we can always go 
ahead and learn the packages. And especially that

07:23.857 --> 07:29.124
nowadays, they try to put the packages in a way that 
one can learn by himself. So they can go and learn it

07:29.144 --> 07:31.727
and apply it. Taking a look at the future of 
planning education in Texas, do you see any

07:33.310 --> 07:55.729
changes in the whole system of having three

07:33.310 --> 07:55.729
certified programs?

07:55.749 --> 08:03.115
You know, I know that we have three programs which 
may look a little small for such a big state. But on

08:03.635 --> 08:10.484
the other hand, I believe that none of the schools 
has been too big to justify any other program. As

08:10.524 --> 08:15.191
far as I know, all three programs have had only a 
handful of students. Am I right? I think so. Well,

08:16.893 --> 08:23.281
we usually have, at any one time, around 65 to 70 
enrolled. In master program or? Well, in all three

08:24.924 --> 08:26.966
degree programs. We have the Master of Science in 
Land Development, the MUP, and the PhD. But if you

08:33.942 --> 08:44.198
put the PhD separate, and perhaps in the land 
development a little bit separate, you are going

08:33.942 --> 08:44.198
to have about 40, am I right? 40 is not, I mean, 40 you 
and perhaps about 30, 40... If we stay with 40 that

08:51.340 --> 08:56.626
we are now, it would be 120. And I remember coming 
from Los Angeles area, in Los Angeles alone, there

08:58.588 --> 09:06.096
were three, four planning programs. Each one of 
them, at least UCLA and USC, I believe, had about

09:07.477 --> 09:14.465
50, 60 each. And then there was Cal Poly program 
that had 150 students or something. Pomona one.

09:22.112 --> 09:31.824
And then there was that private school I forgot 
which the name of the program wasn't directly

09:22.112 --> 09:31.824
planning, it was something like public 
administration. Pepperdine? Pepperdine. They

09:33.446 --> 09:34.948
had some students there too. So one metropolitan 
area almost having twice of all our students. So in

09:41.076 --> 09:45.782
some sense I don't think that we need more schools, 
at least for now. But on the other hand, I believe

09:45.998 --> 09:59.674
that this growth which happened in Texas happened 
so fast that so many of the communities couldn't

09:45.998 --> 09:59.674
realize that they needed planners to handle that. 
But now that the wave is gone and they have seen how

10:00.294 --> 10:07.683
much mistakes they have done, hopefully they 
realize that they have done mistakes. Some of them

10:07.883 --> 10:11.247
I'm sure they won't realize. Some of them are 
realizing now and they are starting to hire or to

10:11.918 --> 10:19.691
feel that gradually they need to have such staff 
there. So I feel that gradually, very slowly, the

10:19.711 --> 10:29.927
demand for planners is going to increase a little 
bit, at least in the public sector, especially in

10:19.711 --> 10:29.927
cities and counties, et cetera. if that trend is 
correct then perhaps we're going to have a little

10:30.211 --> 10:50.532
bit more demand but that doesn't to me that doesn't 
mean that we're going to have 100 students each or

10:30.211 --> 10:50.532
something means that we're going to move from 40 to 
50 because we are talking about stable type of

10:30.211 --> 10:50.532
situations but in regard to what area we'll need to 
cover for those things. Of course, one area is just

10:54.582 --> 11:13.374
dealing with the growth and managing the urban 
areas, because it is traditional in Texas that so

10:54.582 --> 11:13.374
many areas have just used to manage the urban areas 
without planning, or even without zoning, as the

10:54.582 --> 11:13.374
case of Houston, etc. And gradually, I think, 
these things would, the wave has started, of

11:16.634 --> 11:23.601
course, years ago to come from west and east to 
here. And if we consider that trend, we're going to

11:24.782 --> 11:33.751
see that more cities are going to have formal 
planning organizations or counties. So there is a

11:34.052 --> 11:36.354
need in that side to be fulfilled. I think we have a 
mission to teach actual practice of planning in

11:36.374 --> 11:45.223
terms of physical planning, that they go and do it. 
On the other hand, there are all the new areas of

11:45.710 --> 11:56.322
planning, which has been, I don't know, the output 
of, say, 60s and 70s. And perhaps in some regions,

11:56.862 --> 12:01.347
it's starting to come down and semi-die off. Some 
of those ways are going to come here, like social

12:01.367 --> 12:08.595
planning a little bit, or I don't know, other 
health planning. other discussions which may not

12:08.795 --> 12:37.789
be directly a core area of planning or physical 
planning or so and those I think being already

12:08.795 --> 12:37.789
discovered by different communities and 
organizations even private sector one as we were

12:08.795 --> 12:37.789
talking real estate etc I think there is also 
demand there that we got to try to fulfill those so

12:08.795 --> 12:37.789
overall the way I see planning here and I think that 
we should gear up to train people for both of those,

12:38.039 --> 12:52.661
both the public side, which is the actual physical 
planning side, but also the other social and art

12:38.039 --> 12:52.661
things.

12:52.681 --> 13:01.515
We have one student that graduated with a clear 
idea of going into institutional planning.

13:02.204 --> 13:04.567
I didn't quite know what he meant by that. I don't 
know what you're talking about. But what he wanted

13:08.511 --> 13:21.045
to do was actually restructure organizations

13:08.511 --> 13:21.045
and to look at them from an effectiveness point of 
view. And he started out in the New Orleans school

13:21.806 --> 13:26.311
district. So there are all sorts of little niches 
that people can move into. The question that has

13:32.596 --> 13:54.540
come up with Paul that perhaps the three 
accredited schools can't teach every specialty

13:32.596 --> 13:54.540
and that maybe we ought to get together and 
identify what the needs of Texas are. And then

13:55.141 --> 13:56.382
separate the area. And then who has what kinds of 
current capabilities and then draw some

14:01.823 --> 14:04.325
conclusions from that. And we already have a 
cooperative agreement with the University of

14:05.646 --> 14:13.373
Texas at Austin. And that, frankly, is on paper 
only. It doesn't seem to be functioning very well.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.261
Which is what? Pardon? Which is what? That a 
student can take a course at the University of

14:23.863 --> 14:29.468
Texas If it is similar to what offered at A&M, they 
can take it, for example, during the summertime if

14:29.785 --> 14:36.575
they are in an internship there. And we can include 
it in their degree program for credit at A&M, which

14:36.835 --> 14:44.907
seems only logical. But logic does not prevail in 
academia. Yeah, especially by the way of funding.

14:52.773 --> 14:57.058
I don't know how is your funding system, but I 
believe it would be very similar to ours.

14:57.078 --> 15:00.261
Eventually, we are one type of system, I think. If 
you are going to create ours, you've got to

15:00.281 --> 15:08.110
naturally try to keep all the created ours for 
yourself, and that would create the problem.

15:08.130 --> 15:09.872
Sure. So it's a problem. We ran into all sorts of red 
tape with this one particular student. Not all of

15:18.655 --> 15:33.235
it because of the institutional arrangements, 
some of it was because of the enthusiasm of the

15:18.655 --> 15:33.235
student in moving ahead of the ability of the 
organizational structure to handle it. But these

15:33.255 --> 15:38.983
sorts of things can be worked out, it seems to me. 
And not that I think that there's an advantage of

15:39.243 --> 15:45.912
having multiple schools and planning. And I also 
think that UT Arlington is geographically

15:46.516 --> 15:54.208
situated the best of any of them. Yeah, because the 
other one is in Austin, and there's nothing in

15:54.228 --> 15:58.534
Houston. You are the closest one to Houston. Well, 
Texas Southern. But they are not accurate. Do they

16:06.146 --> 16:08.049
have a planning program? Essentially no longer.

16:13.017 --> 16:15.240
That, it's... predominantly Negro college, and 
John Shanahan taught there for a while, but he's no

16:15.980 --> 16:27.056
longer with them.

16:27.196 --> 16:32.444
Are there any thoughts that you want to include 
that we haven't already touched on? Not really at

16:32.825 --> 16:35.689
this moment. Just come to my mind later. Okay, 
well, you'll be getting a transcript of this

16:38.052 --> 16:41.177
whenever It's completed. Sure. And then you can go 
over it again and make any notations you wish.

16:49.695 --> 16:50.476
Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.

16:55.002 --> 16:58.267
This is June 19, 1987. We are in the office of Dr. 
Joel Goldstein at the University of Texas in

16:58.848 --> 17:04.296
Arlington. Joel, let's begin with your 
background, your education, your first

17:05.137 --> 17:21.480
professional work, and then how it came that you 
landed at Arlington. Let's go back in history. I

17:23.222 --> 17:28.630
was an undergraduate to a bachelor's degree in 
architecture from the University of

17:23.222 --> 17:28.630
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. and was an 
assistant for a number of planning professors and

17:29.740 --> 17:39.730
courses, a work assistant as an undergraduate. 
Got interested in planning, took planning

17:39.750 --> 17:49.360
courses, had joint studios with Paul Davidoff and 
Ian McCarr and a bunch of others. Was Myerson there

17:49.480 --> 17:50.601
then? Yes. Everybody was there. Dykman, Wheaton. 
Yes. The golden era. Right. The golden era. I got

17:59.710 --> 18:05.438
interested in planning and knew that I wasn't 
going to... What was the date you got your

17:59.710 --> 18:05.438
architecture degree? June 1963. And it was... I 
knew that I wasn't going to just be an architect

18:10.886 --> 18:15.613
with my professional planning degree. I was going 
to get a professional planning degree someday or

18:15.633 --> 18:18.637
other. And I ended up working and practicing and 
getting licensed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

18:19.959 --> 18:28.671
first. I'm taking the licensing exam for New 
Jersey, no reciprocity across the river. I take

18:35.087 --> 18:36.449
the exam all over again. I'm licensed in New Jersey 
as an architect, and I look for graduate schools.

18:42.177 --> 18:44.701
It was after about six years of practice in 
Philadelphia.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.070
Okay. And ended up looking at schools and ended up 
getting a master's in urban design at Washington

18:54.740 --> 19:20.486
University in St. Louis, spending about a year 
there on campus, and then went for a couple of years

18:54.740 --> 19:20.486
to Tulsa, Oklahoma to run a community design 
center in a black neighborhood in a low-income

18:54.740 --> 19:20.486
Indian neighborhood in Tulsa for a couple of 
years. What year was that? That was 1969-70.

19:26.600 --> 19:39.114
And during that time, I lived in Tulsa, worked at 
the design center, and commuted to Stillwater

19:26.600 --> 19:39.114
three days a week for classes, other classes I was 
responsible for as a faculty member. And worked in

19:40.836 --> 19:52.590
Citizens Action there, and then more or less had a 
better offer in Detroit and went on the faculty of

19:40.836 --> 19:52.590
the University of Detroit. as an associate 
professor, jumping rank from assistant to

19:52.570 --> 19:57.055
associate. And at the same time, worked in the 
profession as second in charge of architectural

19:58.137 --> 20:13.815
design and chief planner for Giffles Associates 
in Detroit, the third largest AE firm in the world.

20:15.257 --> 20:21.244
Flew all around the country doing projects while I 
was on the faculty. at the University of Detroit,

20:22.051 --> 20:26.056
teaching planning, urban design, and 
architecture. Sounds like a good combination.

20:29.200 --> 20:35.227
Yeah, it was for a couple of years, and then I took my 
PhD while I was doing all of that. And ended up,

20:37.210 --> 20:50.286
about the five years I was in Detroit, the last 
three years, not teaching at University of

20:37.210 --> 20:50.286
Detroit, but just doing my PhD in Giffles 
Associates. and got my PhD at Michigan State

20:51.768 --> 21:11.339
University, East Lansing, in urban and regional 
planning with cognate areas in social psychology

20:51.768 --> 21:11.339
and political science, social change, studying 
psychology and psychometric, psychological

20:51.768 --> 21:11.339
statistics. Strange combination. So you moved 
away from physical design. Totally into this

21:16.706 --> 21:20.910
social planning. Then I

21:20.930 --> 21:30.160
was offered the job here to come in as the first 
director of the planning program in the School of

21:20.930 --> 21:30.160
Architecture. Probably in 1975,

21:31.061 --> 21:42.193
fall of 1975, as their first director of the 
planning program. the new planning program here

21:42.393 --> 21:45.738
at UT Arlington. That's when we met. Right.

21:50.185 --> 22:12.197
And one thing, as an inexperienced planning 
professor

21:50.185 --> 22:12.197
at this school, inexperienced with Texas, I began 
to learn and practice in my spare time when I wasn't

21:50.185 --> 22:12.197
involved with university duties.

22:13.730 --> 22:20.424
Dallas-Fort Worth and big projects around the 
country.

22:20.444 --> 22:28.640
Taking a look at the program here, what would you 
say are its strong points and its weak points?

22:29.823 --> 22:31.286
Strong ones first. Definite strong points is its 
balanced balanced emphasis towards development

22:35.937 --> 22:46.516
and

22:35.937 --> 22:46.516
cities. In other words, the social aspects, the 
residents, are not seen as black hats or white

22:54.500 --> 22:56.442
hats. The developers are not seen as black hats or 
white hats. Both sides seem to be taught by the

22:59.886 --> 23:04.672
faculty as being equally as important. The 
balance is there. Number two, I think that the

23:07.375 --> 23:22.752
strong point is that as a commuting school, the 
only one in the region that we know of, by region I

23:07.375 --> 23:22.752
mean broad, let's say six, seven, eight state 
regions, where are primarily a commuting school,

23:24.200 --> 23:29.287
a night program. And that's a strength because in 
the tight times of planning jobs in this almost 12

23:30.709 --> 23:48.452
years that I've been here, it has given students an 
opportunity to enroll in a planning program, get

23:30.709 --> 23:48.452
their first job while a student, and graduate with 
two or three years experience by the time they

23:49.512 --> 23:55.761
finish their coursework and they've graduated. 
So they're already working in their job when they

23:56.542 --> 23:59.126
graduate. Or they're moving to their second job 
with two or three years experience. So I think

24:04.193 --> 24:05.315
that's very strong. Yeah, it has benefits in the 
classroom, too. Yes, it does. There's lots of war

24:08.660 --> 24:10.963
stories that get told. And there's a lot of 
networking that the students do between each

24:12.547 --> 24:18.354
other in the classroom. The disadvantages are the 
same thing. Those commuting students are tired

24:20.637 --> 24:23.241
from having worked all day. They come in the 
classroom at night, 7 o'clock at night. Many of

24:26.705 --> 24:32.673
them can't keep their head up because they've been 
studying hard the nights before in preparation

24:26.705 --> 24:32.673
for classwork. And you can't go as late as you'd 
like. What about the faculty? Faculty are sleepy,

24:39.477 --> 24:40.639
too. Demands on the faculty. Faculty, if you teach 
two nights a week, which is our typical teaching

24:42.361 --> 24:58.079
load, until 10.30 at night, from 7 to 10.30, the 
pressures, the social pressures of the job are to

24:42.361 --> 24:58.079
be in your office all during the day. And if you're 
not in in the morning, the other faculty kind of

24:58.961 --> 25:01.604
wander. So there's a lot of pressure, so you end up 
with a lot of unproductive time because you're so

25:05.197 --> 25:08.001
physically tired. It is not the ideal academic 
situation. It's great for students. It's been

25:14.309 --> 25:15.470
great for students. The way the economy is, it's 
been bad for faculty. In

25:18.414 --> 25:33.634
terms of the substance of the curriculum here in 
your Master of City and Regional Planning degree,

25:34.677 --> 25:42.026
How do you feel that this compares with other 
master's degrees in planning around the

25:34.677 --> 25:42.026
countryside?

25:45.490 --> 26:00.448
I would say that a number of schools we've heard 
about, your side, not with checking, they have

25:45.490 --> 26:00.448
their actual, any kind of, running any actual 
testing of their graduates or anything. appears

26:01.154 --> 26:05.140
many of them are just social welfare planning 
oriented programs. Some of the others are

26:06.301 --> 26:15.475
strictly public agency training kinds of 
programs as a result of accreditation

26:06.301 --> 26:15.475
guidelines. I think where we kind of have 
succeeded over the years is that we're trying to

26:15.495 --> 26:24.107
train people to go into real estate and land 
development jobs as well as consulting jobs in

26:24.644 --> 26:34.435
addition to the public sector traditional 
planning jobs. And because of the job market the

26:35.496 --> 26:40.682
way it is in the metro area, the job opportunities 
have existed. And we have a number of students that

26:41.223 --> 26:47.230
have entered our program and worked for major 
developers, major national developers.

26:47.770 --> 26:50.854
Dallas-Fort Worth has the advantage of having 
some the most major development companies in the

26:51.323 --> 26:57.110
United States and Canada here. So it's been a 
confluence of real estate and land development

26:57.130 --> 27:02.317
dollars for the United States. They've spilled in 
here from Germany, from Canada, bounce in Dallas,

27:02.377 --> 27:10.667
Fort Worth, and then spill over into Houston, 
California, to Chicago. So there's been a

27:11.888 --> 27:13.430
bouncing effect. So there's been an opportunity 
for our students to get to work for the banking

27:13.510 --> 27:21.280
community, the financial institutions, as well 
as the real estate and land development

27:21.766 --> 27:24.348
community. So that the planning accreditation 
guidelines of having this public sector base

27:25.750 --> 27:39.083
begins to get broadened through the way that we've 
been teaching in our classes.

27:42.246 --> 27:50.794
There's no doubt about it, your location is very 
advantageous for an urban planner. certainly

27:51.095 --> 27:54.559
much better than Austin or College Station. Next 
year you are facing the visiting team from the

27:56.262 --> 28:03.731
Accreditation Committee of APA.

28:07.256 --> 28:14.726
Recently we underwent such an examination and it 
resulted in some changes in our core curriculum.

28:14.766 --> 28:20.393
Do you anticipate any such changes to your 
curriculum or structure?

28:23.039 --> 28:33.397
I would say the curriculum has been just worked on 
over the past two or three years in creating a new

28:23.039 --> 28:33.397
program that was just initiated about a year ago. I 
don't think that any fault will be found in the new

28:33.417 --> 28:40.428
program by the accreditation team. I think there 
may be some structural changes according to the

28:41.170 --> 28:49.063
way the planning program has been administered in 
to the Institute of Urban Studies that go

28:49.499 --> 29:02.497
negatively to the guidelines for accreditation. 
Well then it might help the program quite a bit by

29:02.517 --> 29:10.327
having the outside comments.

29:10.347 --> 29:11.008
I believe so. Politically I don't really wish to 
elaborate on that. Okay, we'll go on to another

29:17.116 --> 29:19.219
topic. Regarding the future of Texas and 
particularly planning for the future in Texas, do

29:20.245 --> 29:41.967
you see any changes in the offing in regard to 
planning education to meet any possible changes?

29:41.987 --> 29:48.514
I think the most critical thing today is learning 
to effectively infiltrate citizens groups to

29:50.013 --> 29:58.282
create behavioral change, that planning is being 
stopped by residents. Any kind of change is being

29:58.422 --> 30:01.745
affected. City budgets are being affected by 
residents. The not in my backyard syndrome is

30:05.689 --> 30:16.721
rampant with all the displacees that have come 
here to make their fortunes, to live in the

30:05.689 --> 30:16.721
Dallas-Fort Worth area and into Texas. People are 
settling in. And I think that it's almost going to

30:19.308 --> 30:41.060
have to be for the same kind of citizens' action 
kinds of activities by planners into the 90s, the

30:19.308 --> 30:41.060
1990s, that are going to be very similar to the 60s 
of the years of social planning, social welfare

30:19.308 --> 30:41.060
planning, for opposite reasons. A rebirth of 
advocacy planning? Not advocacy, but let's say

30:44.685 --> 30:48.471
reverse advocacy planning. in favor of 
pro-development in order for people to be able to

30:48.755 --> 30:55.164
get through the economic conditions of the times. 
In other words, I see fiscal stress due to a federal

30:55.845 --> 31:05.059
deficit, budget deficit, and people having less 
and less discretionary income. As a result of

31:05.620 --> 31:18.238
that, they can very well benefit by planning, by 
having sound fiscal planning that is through

31:05.620 --> 31:18.238
effective pro-development postures being to 
their ultimate advantage, that planning on the

31:19.383 --> 31:42.353
basis of what people want for them, they may not, 
they need to be led to what they should have through

31:19.383 --> 31:42.353
professionalism, more of an elitist attitude, 
but yet through a participatory mode. It's

31:43.582 --> 31:44.403
interesting. Paul Geisel, in answer to that 
question, felt that planning had resurrected its

31:44.884 --> 32:06.609
good name, which came to me as a surprise because I 
think that in our area of Texas and College Station

31:44.884 --> 32:06.609
and East Central Texas, planning is still a dirty 
word. But he felt that in the Metroplex area, that

32:10.818 --> 32:31.105
because of citizen participation and citizen 
planning of neighborhoods, that planning had

32:10.818 --> 32:31.105
again become quite a

32:10.818 --> 32:31.105
positive force and had achieved a new degree of 
respect.

32:33.734 --> 32:53.513
I think there's a respect there, but I think the 
respect is there on the part of the local elected

32:33.734 --> 32:53.513
officials who are running all the land use 
decision-making, because they can hide behind it

32:33.734 --> 32:53.513
effectively from a legal perspective and make 
their own self-interest decisions. So I think

32:55.315 --> 33:02.222
that's where planning may be considered 
resurrected in the minds of the elected

32:55.315 --> 33:02.222
officials. As far as actual planning goes, I think 
not. I think that they're clearly doing

33:07.502 --> 33:16.774
themselves in with exclusionary planning and 
exclusionary zoning without planning. Without

33:18.556 --> 33:28.549
planning, yes, which is conceptually an 
unacceptable procedure. Absolutely. they

33:30.738 --> 33:35.347
certainly wouldn't be able to get away with that in 
Oregon, where planning has mattered. Or

33:35.367 --> 33:44.625
Michigan, or Wisconsin, or Florida, 
Pennsylvania, which isn't as strong as other

33:35.367 --> 33:44.625
states, and on and on, Tennessee.

33:47.731 --> 33:50.316
Planning has been very undeveloped in Texas. And 
you can see it and you can feel it when you operate in

33:50.532 --> 33:54.517
the arena of planning. It's clear. It's been 
undeveloped. There's been no traditional

33:57.341 --> 34:03.288
planning that I can put my finger on except for Fort 
Worth, Texas. Fort Worth has had the tradition

34:03.869 --> 34:18.447
because it's been almost like a city of beautiful 
activity by the elite who have been dilettantes in

34:03.869 --> 34:18.447
the planning since the 54 Victor Gruen plant and 
going back even earlier than that. I haven't

34:19.608 --> 34:23.072
written about Fort Worth yet, but I have written 
about El Paso. And El Paso's planning program got

34:23.412 --> 34:26.616
started in 1919. And they've been doing it ever 
since. In fact, there's a question about whether

34:30.481 --> 34:41.133
or not their city council was the first in the 
country to adopt a comprehensive plan that was

34:30.481 --> 34:41.133
professionally formulated. One usually thinks 
that this happened in 1925 in, was it Cincinnati? I

34:49.392 --> 34:52.116
think it was Cincinnati. With Bettman? Yes, with 
Bettman and others. And the question I'm going to

34:56.302 --> 35:05.857
have to research is the exact date on which all city 
councils took action. Because it might be that El

35:05.877 --> 35:11.485
Paso, we might have to rewrite history. When I 
first began here in 1975, the dean was Dean Hal Box,

35:13.338 --> 35:27.112
who was an architect and was in practice in Dallas 
with the two others. Architectural.

35:28.553 --> 35:29.734
Architectural practice. And Hal Box was dean for 
approximately a year during my time to a year and a

35:39.393 --> 35:49.897
half, I forget exactly which, but sometime either 
fall of 76 or spring of 77 he left to become dean of UT

35:39.393 --> 35:49.897
Austin. At that time an acting dean, or interim 
dean, was George Wright, for about a year or two,

35:56.251 --> 36:03.486
and they had a search, and the university selected 
George Wright to be the new dean. George Wright

36:03.946 --> 36:05.009
stayed there. Another architect? Another 
architect from Albuquerque. They'd been in an

36:09.117 --> 36:12.724
unsuccessful practice in Albuquerque. And he had 
been an assistant to Hal Box, and that's how he

36:13.447 --> 36:20.414
basically got it. Older man, the oldest person on 
the faculty just about, so therefore you must know

36:20.695 --> 36:28.503
something because he's of age. And

36:29.864 --> 36:42.998
what then happened was that planning was 
considered a program with a shared budget with a

36:43.585 --> 36:52.454
landscape architecture program, architecture 
and interior design. The numbers were

36:54.096 --> 37:03.806
misbalanced and all of the undergraduates 
selecting a major were advised by architecture

36:54.096 --> 37:03.806
professors. Sounds like A&M. So the architecture 
professors steered, in my opinion, steered

37:11.497 --> 37:30.077
students into architecture, the bulk was in 
architecture, a very few in number or interior

37:11.497 --> 37:30.077
design, and planning got, did not get their share 
in the undergraduate emphasis. As far as the

37:30.938 --> 37:39.867
graduate program went, we were left alone, but we 
shared budgets with architecture and planning,

37:30.938 --> 37:39.867
graduate. Our first students were... Is that 
still the situation? No, let me give you the

37:44.118 --> 37:45.741
history. Upon applying for accreditation and 
working with it, the former dean, Dean Wright,

37:47.043 --> 38:01.144
gave separate budgeting power and autonomy of 
program to the planning program. And we obtained

38:02.346 --> 38:09.617
our accreditation, I believe, in 77 or 78, 
remarkably quick. because of their support. And

38:15.267 --> 38:38.743
we had four years within the School of 
Architecture, and during that time, the planning

38:15.267 --> 38:38.743
faculty, Gene Brooks and a fellow named Barry 
Rubin, who was a graduate of the University of

38:15.267 --> 38:38.743
Wisconsin, and some graduate students, of ours 
made a political move to get planning out of the

38:39.888 --> 39:00.467
School of Architecture and successfully moved it 
out of architecture, succeeded in doing so, and

38:39.888 --> 39:00.467
moved it into the graduate school. Jean Brooks 
stayed behind in the School of Architecture as a

39:01.168 --> 39:06.773
teacher of undergraduate urban design Barry 
Rubin got a distaste for the university and left to

39:07.580 --> 39:16.210
go to the University of Indiana to teach planning.

39:20.514 --> 39:36.152
So we were under the graduate dean as an 
interdisciplinary program for two years with a

39:20.514 --> 39:36.152
sociologist for a department chairman. who had 
been appointed by new disciplinary planning

39:37.448 --> 39:41.313
faculty. Who was that? That was Lee Taylor, 
L-E-E-T-A-Y-L-O-R.

39:42.314 --> 40:06.426
Lee Taylor's interest was Newtowns as a 
sociologist, and at the end of two years,

39:42.314 --> 40:06.426
we clearly did not have faculty representation on 
campus on any committees, faculty senate, and all

40:07.317 --> 40:07.958
that. And the dean of the graduate school had us as 
the only academic unit under his tutelage. So he

40:13.582 --> 40:14.383
didn't want us. So we were asked to recommend a 
place on campus. Vice President for Academic

40:20.768 --> 40:32.798
Affairs went to our faculty, and we agreed with his 
recommendation to come into the Institute of

40:20.768 --> 40:32.798
Urban Studies, which we are now. We came in as a 
full-fledged department. with accreditation.

40:39.391 --> 40:42.055
We had an accreditation team visit within two 
years. At that time, which was about six years

40:42.696 --> 40:54.513
thereafter of me coming here, I again became 
chairman of the Department of City and Regional

40:42.696 --> 40:54.513
Planning. At this time it was a department. It was a 
department for a full year, and the dean made a

40:57.357 --> 41:06.670
decision that there would be no departments, that 
we would be called a program.

41:09.215 --> 41:15.268
So my business cards went from chairman to 
director. And there were directors of criminal

41:16.410 --> 41:21.621
justice, director of urban affairs, director of 
city and regional planning. That was, we had... We

41:28.537 --> 41:33.685
had a space on the second floor of University Hall 
that was just city and regional planning. We were

41:33.725 --> 41:37.530
not integrated with the Institute of Urban 
Studies on the fifth floor. We were separate and

41:37.790 --> 41:44.961
distinct from the very high visibility portion of 
the building where everyone could see us up at the

41:37.790 --> 41:44.961
stairwell.

41:47.585 --> 41:53.894
And we succeeded to gain in enrollments and we were 
doing just fine. The dean made a decision to

41:58.169 --> 42:26.185
integrate us fully with the institute of urban 
studies

41:58.169 --> 42:26.185
well you the dean had just asked you to take the job 
as chairman and you declined and i declined i had

41:58.169 --> 42:26.185
some research interest and i felt that for my own 
professional academic career, it was time for me

42:26.603 --> 42:32.470
to work toward promotion to full professor level. 
And I had also some interesting outside

42:34.332 --> 42:40.800
consulting projects directly related to my 
university teaching. Comprehensive plans for

42:41.280 --> 42:53.995
communities to do, advisory to different cities 
on urban design matters, and some ordinance

42:41.280 --> 42:53.995
writing.

42:55.190 --> 43:01.438
So you continued on as a teaching professor 
without administrative responsibilities.

43:01.458 --> 43:02.739
Which is where I am now. And who took over as 
department chairman? Well, it appears from what

43:06.304 --> 43:12.251
has been said that the dean of the Institute of 
Urban Studies has. There was no department

43:12.992 --> 43:15.034
chairman. Has not been for two years.

43:21.282 --> 43:23.965
What will happen when the APA accreditation team 
visits, and they discover you have no department

43:24.687 --> 43:29.533
head.

43:32.476 --> 43:36.721
I would assume that that will be one of the items 
that they write up as being a deficiency. I would

43:37.282 --> 43:38.383
think so, too. And do you have control over your 
budget currently? No, the dean controls the

43:44.771 --> 43:48.556
budget. When did that change? That changed when I 
was no longer when he eliminated all the directors

43:55.130 --> 43:58.514
in the Institute of Urban Studies. And

43:59.055 --> 44:04.801
does he understand the consequences of that?

44:07.825 --> 44:09.066
It had been explained to him.

44:16.815 --> 44:24.124
As far as

44:16.815 --> 44:24.124
the day-to-day operations of the department go, 
You mentioned that Arj Anjamani is in charge of the

44:24.813 --> 44:33.265
graduate studies. He is graduate advisor. 
Advisor. And what does Bob Wagner do these days?

44:42.118 --> 44:53.554
Bob Wagner teaches in the planning program, 
teaches courses in the planning program,

44:42.118 --> 44:53.554
graduate, and he works on the Texas chapter APA 
newsletter. And he is working as an editor on the

44:54.091 --> 45:03.503
Texas Planning Magazine, which had been at A&M 
University. He's quite busy. And he also does

45:04.444 --> 45:10.792
training courses for lay planning 
practitioners. Lay planners, rather. There's

45:13.335 --> 45:20.925
some question in my mind about whether or not that 
is in competition with the short course offered by

45:13.335 --> 45:20.925
the Texas chapter.

45:23.673 --> 45:32.448
I think that it is not because it ends up being a 
special course for one community that he'll

45:23.673 --> 45:32.448
travel down to. If the vehicle,

45:33.409 --> 45:45.630
the annual short course is a large operation. 
where people come from all over the country, all

45:45.982 --> 45:49.685
over the state, rather. I really don't think that 
it is in competition. At first I thought that, but

45:53.989 --> 45:59.975
not since I've seen some of his attendance lists. I 
think a lot would depend upon the material

46:01.916 --> 46:04.199
covered. It varies. Sometimes he's talking to 
them about capital budgets. Sometimes it's

46:10.364 --> 46:15.769
strictly about what planning is and why you should 
plan. Other times it's about ordinances. Well, we

46:19.344 --> 46:28.189
certainly don't need to have any paucity of 
spreading the word about planning.

46:31.021 --> 46:40.232
The fiscal condition of the University of Texas at 
Arlington has been abysmal for the last five years

46:31.021 --> 46:40.232
as far as planning goes and the Institute of Urban 
Studies. Faculty raises have not been of any

46:40.913 --> 46:44.197
substance whatsoever. They've been less than 
Texas A&M and UT Austin. And the raises, the

46:48.882 --> 46:57.332
faculty raises, have been demoralizing

46:48.882 --> 46:57.332
and insulting.
