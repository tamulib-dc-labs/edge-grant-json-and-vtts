WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:14.182
So a couple of years after I had graduated and had 
left the laboratory, I decided to go back to Ohio

00:01.786 --> 00:14.182
State for more extensive graduate work. And I got a 
job back at the lab where I had worked before. And so

00:19.389 --> 00:31.084
that was where I worked and completed my graduate 
program then in the early 60s.

00:32.768 --> 00:49.556
Then after I got the PhD from Ohio State,

00:32.768 --> 00:49.556
determined that there wasn't really much of a 
future there for me, largely because there were

00:32.768 --> 00:49.556
young men on top of me, so to speak, 
organizationally. And so I started looking

00:50.818 --> 00:58.050
around, and

00:50.818 --> 00:58.050
the department head There at Ohio State was an old 
friend of Professor Al Kronk, who was at that time

00:58.351 --> 01:04.378
the department head here. They had both been 
together at Minnesota way back many years ago. And

01:08.322 --> 01:16.971
so through my department head's good offices 
there at Ohio State, I learned about the position

01:08.322 --> 01:16.971
here at Texas A&M. I had interviewed a number of 
other institutions, both public and private. But

01:23.178 --> 01:28.003
I came to Texas A&M and liked what I saw. I 
particularly liked the community because I

01:28.405 --> 01:36.716
thought it was a good atmosphere in which to raise 
my kids, and that was a very important matter to me.

01:37.718 --> 01:42.524
And so we came to Texas A&M in the fall of 1964. Okay. 
When did you complete your Ph.D. requirements?

01:47.230 --> 01:47.471
When? In 64. At Ohio State. At Ohio State, right. 
What was the topic of your dissertation? It had to

01:53.118 --> 01:58.125
do with similarity parameters in hypersonic 
flow. It has to do with chemically reacting flows

01:58.443 --> 02:05.213
and reentry processes. Before we move on, let me 
ask you a little more about your boyhood years.

02:09.700 --> 02:12.103
What reminiscence do you have of the Depression?

02:15.348 --> 02:20.676
Well,

02:15.348 --> 02:20.676
fairly vivid actually. Although we were we 
suffered very little in the Depression. My father

02:27.073 --> 02:39.447
owned a bakery in a small town in Ohio, central 
Ohio, a little town called Pleasantville, which

02:27.073 --> 02:39.447
is, oh, I guess about 40 miles or so almost due east 
of Columbus. And dad was a very successful baker,

02:40.729 --> 02:51.842
and

02:40.729 --> 02:51.842
he had a, you know, had a good business and a good 
operation there. That is, our business Although

02:53.253 --> 03:03.923
the bakery was located in Pleasantville,

02:53.253 --> 03:03.923
he delivered bakery products to a lot of the other 
small towns around there. And so during the

03:05.064 --> 03:08.327
Depression, really we did quite well. My most 
vivid recollection about it is of those people who

03:09.989 --> 03:14.813
did not do well. I can remember he had brothers, and 
of course my mother's family some of them did not do

03:22.447 --> 03:51.272
well and i can remember our loading up baskets of of 
groceries and of course bakery goods but meat and

03:22.447 --> 03:51.272
fruit and stuff and and taking them to other 
members of the family other you know other other

03:22.447 --> 03:51.272
family units and i can remember

03:22.447 --> 03:51.272
people coming to the bakery and asking for Well, if 
they didn't have much money, well, they would buy

03:52.096 --> 03:59.785
day-old bread and stale products, or partially 
stale products. And I can remember, of course, a

04:01.347 --> 04:07.955
lot of drifters, or tramps, as we called them then. 
And I'm sure a lot of them good people. They would

04:10.678 --> 04:21.090
come knock on the back door of my parents' house and 
offer to do work in exchange for a meal. And I

04:22.032 --> 04:23.513
remember lots of those.

04:26.636 --> 04:33.964
But as far as my own family was concerned, of 
course, I was an only child and typically a spoiled

04:26.636 --> 04:33.964
brat. And so as far as the Depression touching me 
personally, I was pretty high on the hog. But I can

04:44.494 --> 04:46.616
sure remember others who were not. What did you 
think of the New Deal program?

04:51.513 --> 05:03.588
Well,

04:51.513 --> 05:03.588
I guess at the time, it was probably the right thing 
to do. Of course, there are those who maintain that

05:04.008 --> 05:19.647
the country would have rebounded and prospered 
regardless of how it would have been done, or

05:04.008 --> 05:19.647
saying it another way, that it rebounded and 
prospered either because of or in spite of

05:20.453 --> 05:25.199
Franklin D. Roosevelt's program.

05:28.163 --> 05:31.246
But it worked without a question. And the country, 
of course, by the time the war began in 1939, that is

05:31.867 --> 05:47.727
the war in Europe, not the war involving the US and 
the Japanese.

05:49.141 --> 05:58.752
The country actually had begun to rebound pretty 
well, but it was really the war that finished the

05:49.141 --> 05:58.752
recovery from the Depression. And so it's 
difficult to really describe how much of that was

06:00.473 --> 06:10.785
really produced by New Deal policies and how much 
of it was not. But I know my grandfather, my

06:12.947 --> 06:19.114
mother's father, worked on the WPA, the Works 
Project Administration, which was an element of

06:19.904 --> 06:41.946
the New Deal, which involved taking out-of-job,

06:19.904 --> 06:41.946
out-of-work workers and placing them in task 
forces which would do public works kinds of

06:19.904 --> 06:41.946
things, build schools and hospitals and roads and 
things like that. And

06:43.208 --> 06:49.354
I know that helped my grandparents And my 
grandfather, of course, he's a very proud man, and

06:50.245 --> 07:10.563
he didn't like that too well because it had all the 
trappings of a government handout, which in

06:50.245 --> 07:10.563
effect it was, but it was really in exchange for 
work, so it certainly was not like a welfare

06:50.245 --> 07:10.563
program that does not involve work. But you have to 
understand that in that area of Ohio, it's a

07:10.603 --> 07:19.611
rock-ribbed conservative area, very 
conservative. And so, I guess the prevailing view

07:21.008 --> 07:33.581
was there that the country recovered really in 
spite of the New Deal program and not because of it.

07:33.701 --> 07:35.142
But I'm not sure. It's like so many of these things. 
Certainly there were some good things that came

07:37.385 --> 07:43.911
out of it and perhaps some things that were not so 
good. Okay. Now let me, again I'm somewhat

07:44.952 --> 07:47.114
confused. From 1951 through 64 you lived in the 
Columbus area. No, we lived

07:51.063 --> 08:02.695
most of that time in the Columbus area, but for a 
time I was working at Wright-Patterson Air Force

07:51.063 --> 08:02.695
Base, which is over at Dayton, which is like 50 
miles away. That's when I was working for Air Force

08:03.937 --> 08:14.488
Intelligence, and that was where I really got my 
first taste of some of the types of work that we do

08:03.937 --> 08:14.488
here at the center now. Well, in Air Force 
antennas, was that, were you enlisted in the Air

08:14.907 --> 08:19.532
Force when you were working there? No, I was 
working as a civilian, and this, and I was not doing

08:19.552 --> 08:39.252
any spying or anything like that, but at that time, 
of course, the, well, it was clear at that time that

08:19.552 --> 08:39.252
the Soviets were going to be major adversaries. 
Winston Churchill had made his famous Iron

08:40.012 --> 08:43.716
Curtain speech in, what, 47, I guess it was, 
something like that. The Soviets were totally

08:48.108 --> 08:57.177
intransigent about the situation in Eastern 
Europe and about the United Nations. And of

08:57.377 --> 09:07.687
course, Korea had begun the Korean War in July of 
50, or June of 50, I guess it was. No, July of 50. And

09:11.851 --> 09:13.433
so it was clear that we were we were in for some 
difficulty there. So

09:15.730 --> 09:23.561
the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center had 
been set up at Wright Field. It

09:23.621 --> 09:33.435
was an offshoot of elements of the old OSS that 
functioned during World War II. And then

09:34.436 --> 09:42.508
immediately following World War II, there had 
been an outfit called Project Paperclip, I think

09:34.436 --> 09:42.508
it was, which had been run by Colonel Hal Watson. 
And Watson's charge in 1945 and 46 and 47 was to go

09:48.118 --> 10:02.815
into Germany and to learn everything that we could 
learn about advanced aeronautical developments

09:48.118 --> 10:02.815
that they had going underway at the end of the war. 
Of course, they had several advanced aircraft

10:02.835 --> 10:13.288
like the Me 262 and the 163 and so forth that were 
flying that were superior to anything that we had.

10:13.741 --> 10:19.909
they had been deployed wrong and in insufficient 
numbers really to affect the outcome of the war. If

10:20.730 --> 10:29.002
they had come along earlier in the war and if Hitler 
had used them right, it would have been a stickier

10:20.730 --> 10:29.002
situation than it was. But in any event, Watson's 
group was to do what I would call the first task of

10:29.102 --> 10:35.791
technical intelligence. And of course we knew 
that because of the way the political forces at the

10:42.884 --> 10:51.056
time divvied up Germany, that the Soviets would 
have access to a lot of that stuff too. And indeed

10:52.018 --> 10:52.779
they do. They got, of course, they got a lot of the 
rocket, the advanced German, the advanced rocket

10:52.859 --> 11:00.651
work done by the Germans toward the tail end of the 
war. And so I'm not really sure when the Air Force

11:01.872 --> 11:07.901
Technical Intelligence Center was set up. I guess 
it must have been around 48, something like that.

11:12.601 --> 11:16.306
And so I arrived over there in 1951. And so my job, I 
went into the guided missile group. And so my job

11:23.497 --> 11:35.053
was to evaluate data from the Soviet Union about 
their missile developments, rocket engine

11:23.497 --> 11:35.053
development, things like that. And so I was there 
until 1953.

11:41.896 --> 11:46.981
And then went back to Ohio State for graduate work. 
I

11:47.001 --> 11:56.832
had

11:47.001 --> 11:56.832
been involved in a dual degree program when I 
entered Ohio State. And it was a combination of

11:57.973 --> 12:02.638
engineering and mathematics degrees. That was a 
program that led to two bachelor's degrees. And I

12:06.662 --> 12:11.667
did that, I guess, perhaps It may have been that the 
Depression had more of an effect on my thinking

12:12.001 --> 12:17.869
than what I anticipated. Because in 1947, and of 
course at that point I was like, what, two years

12:17.929 --> 12:29.104
into my engineering undergraduate program. 47, 
48 was not a good year for engineering graduates.

12:35.772 --> 12:37.755
They were having trouble getting jobs. And 
although I was totally consumed by aerospace

12:38.596 --> 12:46.507
engineering, I really wondered if I was going to be 
able to get a job. So at that point, I went into the

12:46.527 --> 12:59.064
dual degree program to get a degree in mathematics 
with the view being that perhaps I could go teach

12:46.527 --> 12:59.064
math at a junior or community college if I could not 
get a job as an engineer. So I had completed all but

12:59.845 --> 13:08.417
just, I think, two courses for that math degree. 
And so when I left Dayton, Wright-Patterson, the

13:08.718 --> 13:35.350
Air Technical Intelligence Service, and came 
back to Ohio State, let's see, I guess I was

13:08.718 --> 13:35.350
enrolled in graduate school for one semester and 
then I transferred back to undergraduate school

13:08.718 --> 13:35.350
for a summer semester and completed the 
requirements for that math degree and got that in

13:08.718 --> 13:35.350
August of I can't remember, 54, I guess, something 
like that. And then transferred back to graduate

13:40.574 --> 13:58.530
school, completed my master's degree in 56, and 
intended at that point to leave and go back to the

13:40.574 --> 13:58.530
Air Technical Intelligence Center. And my senior 
professor asked me about staying on for a PhD

13:59.991 --> 14:07.598
program Well, of course, I was married by that 
point. By that time, I had a family and could do

14:11.600 --> 14:20.454
nothing more than take one course at a time.

14:23.659 --> 14:26.283
But he offered me a teaching position, too. So I was 
working at the wind tunnel lab and teaching and

14:27.084 --> 14:36.319
going to school.

14:37.362 --> 14:41.869
I remember one exchange that I had with him that was 
rather interesting. I told him that I didn't think

14:41.909 --> 14:55.609
I really wanted to do a PhD because it would take me 
five years, even starting from the master's

14:41.909 --> 14:55.609
level, packing it one course at a time. And I was 30 
at that time. And I said, shoot.

15:03.637 --> 15:07.303
Von, his name was Von Eschen, and everybody called 
him Von. And I said, shoot, Von, in five years, I'll

15:08.505 --> 15:12.251
be 35 years old. And he said, how old will you be in 
five years if you don't do the PhD? Which was, I

15:18.821 --> 15:21.205
guess, a pretty good line, and he had a good point. 
So ultimately, I went ahead, and over an extended

15:21.285 --> 15:30.640
period of time, I finally completed the doggone 
thing. Actually, of course, it took me longer than

15:31.278 --> 15:44.337
five years, but I had a few health problems in the 
middle of the thing and had to lay out for a year and

15:31.278 --> 15:44.337
so forth. During the time that I was at Ohio State, 
of course, the space program, the space era burst

15:44.357 --> 15:56.796
upon us in 56 with the Soviets launching of the 
Sputnik.

15:57.873 --> 16:10.028
There was of course great concern about the 
so-called missile gap that President Kennedy

15:57.873 --> 16:10.028
made so much of in the 1960 election, and which in 
fact did not exist.

16:13.052 --> 16:22.463
But there was great interest in trying to get the 
U.S. into the space program, and a lot of a lot of the

16:22.966 --> 16:34.461
work that we did there at Ohio State in the 
laboratory dealt with very high-speed flight,

16:22.966 --> 16:34.461
so-called hypersonic flight. And so we were 
pretty much on the forefront of at least part of

16:35.141 --> 16:42.271
that effort up there. And so it was a fascinating 
and stimulating time. As far as the aerospace

16:51.620 --> 16:53.582
engineering profession.

16:56.786 --> 17:01.831
One of the sub-elements of aerospace engineering 
is aerodynamics, fluid flow. There are three

17:02.812 --> 17:06.356
other major elements, structures, and 
propulsion, and flight mechanics. Well, in very

17:07.357 --> 17:21.593
high speed flight,

17:07.357 --> 17:21.593
the temperatures that one encounters are so great 
that it causes chemical reactions in the air. In

17:22.332 --> 17:31.204
other words, air, which is normally, if you're 
flying at 200 or 300, 400 miles an hour, is just

17:22.332 --> 17:31.204
plain old N2 and O2, principally. When you get to 
talking about 8,000, 10,000 miles an hour, like

17:32.325 --> 17:48.467
would be the case in a reentry process, then the 
nitrogen and oxygen both dissociate, and the air

17:32.325 --> 17:48.467
becomes a very complex mixture at that time. And so 
most of our work, up there involved this sort of new

17:51.728 --> 18:09.685
regime of aerodynamics where you had to include 
chemically reacting flows or you had to include

17:51.728 --> 18:09.685
chemical reactions in the calculations in order 
to predict the aerodynamic characteristics of

17:51.728 --> 18:09.685
these vehicles. That was one of the reasons why 
some of our early Mercury flights and Gemini

18:09.705 --> 18:20.875
flights missed the target, missed the landing 
area to some extent because we we could not

18:21.597 --> 18:35.629
accurately predict the lift and drag 
characteristics of those reentry vehicles,

18:21.597 --> 18:35.629
largely because of our lack of understanding 
about the chemical reactions that were occurring

18:21.597 --> 18:35.629
around the vehicle. So as I say, it was a very 
exciting time to be there and to watch the

18:36.770 --> 18:50.862
frontiers of aerospace engineering sort of be 
pushed out to encompass the space age. Very

18:55.119 --> 18:55.940
exciting time. Well, that pretty much reviews the 
years then at Ohio State, and as I say, when 64

18:57.101 --> 19:18.604
rolled around, I left and came to Texas, and except 
for a couple of years when I went up to Washington,

18:57.101 --> 19:18.604
we've been here ever since. Okay, when you came to 
Texas A&M in 1964, in what position did you come? I

19:24.353 --> 19:27.636
came as an associate professor of aerospace 
engineering. And you held that until 79? No.

19:33.963 --> 19:46.836
I became full professor two years later in 66, and 
then went up to, in 1969, I left Texas A&M. and went

19:48.183 --> 19:56.374
to the University of Maryland to become head of the 
Aerospace Engineering Department at the

19:48.183 --> 19:56.374
University of Maryland right outside of 
Washington.

20:01.921 --> 20:04.184
I and my family were not happy in Washington. I 
guess this goes back to our Midwestern

20:04.264 --> 20:08.689
conservative heritage. We enjoyed the 
University of Maryland very much. Which city is

20:10.932 --> 20:12.975
that in, the University of Maryland? Well, it's in 
College Park, which is just 20 minutes from the

20:13.462 --> 20:17.949
Capitol building. It's just right outside the 
District of Columbia. And as I say, we enjoyed the

20:20.853 --> 20:26.722
university very much, but we did not enjoy 
Washington at all. Just the attitudes and the, of

20:27.544 --> 20:40.043
course, that was a very turbulent time, tail end of 
the 60s, with all of the campus unrest and so forth.

20:41.272 --> 20:44.878
So, we were up there about two years.

20:47.602 --> 20:54.132
My wife, bless her heart, is one of these 
uncomplaining women. She just never complains.

20:56.175 --> 20:57.478
Is she also from Ohio? Yeah. Well, she was born and 
raised in LA, but she moved to Ohio when she was

20:58.339 --> 21:07.954
young.

21:09.048 --> 21:16.178
Our kids were like, the two girls were like 15 and 
14, and the boy was like 10 or 12, something like

21:09.048 --> 21:16.178
that. And they're pretty much like her. You know, 
they just don't complain. But, you know, if your

21:20.624 --> 21:25.130
sensors are out, you can tell that things are just 
not right. And I had begun to pick up a few of these

21:26.992 --> 21:31.198
things. And I began to ask myself if, in fact, I had 
made a mistake in coming up there. And so one

21:39.338 --> 21:47.947
Christmas vacation, my two girls, they were then, 
I guess, 16 and 15. They had a friend who lived

21:48.047 --> 21:49.668
across the street. And that's what she was a year 
older and was thinking about starting the

21:49.688 --> 21:54.413
university. That's what triggered this whole 
sequence. And so this one Christmas vacation, my

21:57.096 --> 22:04.663
two daughters came to me and said, got a 
proposition for you, Dad. Fire. And they said, we

22:06.659 --> 22:20.676
know about the high cost of college education, 
especially if you have to pay out-of-state fees,

22:06.659 --> 22:20.676
but do you suppose when our time comes, you could 
see your way clear to send us to school back in

22:06.659 --> 22:20.676
Texas? And I wasn't really surprised at what they 
were telling me, but I was surprised that they were

22:22.879 --> 22:33.612
telling me, laying it out so openly, indicating 
some dissatisfaction with that area up there. And

22:34.672 --> 22:39.538
I said, do you mean you'd go to school far away and 
with a bunch of strangers? And Chris, Christine,

22:40.760 --> 22:45.325
the oldest then, and she was just 16 at that point. 
And I can see her like it was yesterday. She looked

22:48.930 --> 22:49.671
at me. She said, Dad, she said, you know as well as I 
do, these people up here don't think like we do,

22:49.711 --> 22:59.943
which I thought was pretty damn perceptive 
because she was exactly on target. They did not

23:00.524 --> 23:02.046
think like we did. The pretentiousness, the 
imagery, which is peculiar to Washington, was

23:02.212 --> 23:11.288
just foreign to us. That filter's added to the 
Maryland and Virginia suburbs, too. Yes, very

23:14.494 --> 23:15.696
much. We lived up in Silver Spring, Maryland, one 
of the Maryland suburbs up in Montgomery County,

23:16.337 --> 23:25.013
but it permeates the area.

23:25.651 --> 23:29.116
So that was really the thing then that tipped the 
scales. And so as a matter of fact, when classes

23:29.196 --> 23:49.363
resumed and I went back into the University of 
Maryland right after Christmas, I walked into the

23:29.196 --> 23:49.363
dean's office and told him that I had to conclude 
regrettably that I had made a mistake in bringing

23:29.196 --> 23:49.363
my family up there.

23:50.103 --> 23:51.785
I started looking then for another job. And of 
course, this was at a time when the space program

23:52.626 --> 23:59.615
was on the way down, and the military aerospace was 
on the way down. It was not a good time for aerospace

23:59.635 --> 24:02.498
engineers. But there was a job at Cincinnati, 
University of Cincinnati, and one at Iowa State

24:02.538 --> 24:13.652
University, jobs that were open. And one at 
Wichita, I guess. But I was tracking these other

24:15.995 --> 24:18.017
jobs. And of course, aerospace enrollments were 
down. And I knew there was nothing in the aerospace

24:22.911 --> 24:29.476
engineering department here at Texas A&M for me. 
But

24:29.516 --> 24:37.103
I told my wife one night, I said, you know, I'm going 
to write Fred Benson. He was the dean here for many,

24:38.003 --> 24:40.706
many years. And just see if there would be any sort 
of a position open for me there. And so I wrote him. I

24:50.583 --> 25:00.116
told him that I had just flat made a mistake in 
coming to Maryland, University of Maryland, and

24:50.583 --> 25:00.116
that I was looking around for another job. And so he 
called me right away, and he said, you forget about

25:00.237 --> 25:05.484
going anyplace else. You're going to come back to 
Texas A&M. And so that eventually was what

25:07.887 --> 25:11.392
happened. And of course, it was a great break for 
me, because it It gave me a chance to move my family

25:17.566 --> 25:23.114
back to an area where they had friends and where we 
knew the school system. And of course, it was great

25:23.154 --> 25:33.449
to come back to A&M because, as I say, I had been 
attracted here seven years earlier. And I felt

25:33.489 --> 25:39.718
that I sort of fit in with Texas A&M. My views are, I 
think, congruent, shall we say, with the general

25:40.599 --> 25:46.628
mood and atmosphere here at A&M. And so I came back 
as a special assistant to the dean. And

25:54.331 --> 26:09.150
incidentally, you ought to do an oral history with 
Fred Benson sometime, who was dean here from 1958

25:54.331 --> 26:09.150
through, what, 1980 or so. And he's a hell of a guy. 
And a lot of people don't understand him very well.

26:16.122 --> 26:25.575
But in any event, when I came here, he made me his 
special assistant for advanced research

26:16.122 --> 26:25.575
efforts. And his only charge was, I think the 
College of Engineering and TEES, the Engineering

26:25.595 --> 26:33.146
Experiment Station, needs to do some new things. 
And he reeled off an incredible set of ideas, some

26:34.868 --> 26:44.762
of which were very far out, of things that we might 
pursue. And so we did some of those and had some

26:45.586 --> 26:53.099
successes and had some failures. And then about 
three years later, his associate dean resigned.

27:03.578 --> 27:10.530
And so he asked me to be his associate dean, which I 
was then, up until up until he retired, and then I

27:12.130 --> 27:16.294
became, I was acting dean until Dr. Page came 
aboard in 79,

27:16.334 --> 27:34.594
which was the time at which the center was set up, 
and then I left the dean's office and became

27:16.334 --> 27:34.594
director of the center, and of course I still, 
throughout most of this period, I taught in

27:16.334 --> 27:34.594
aerospace engineering, and so I still. You came 
back from Maryland to here in what year, 71? 71,

27:37.417 --> 27:40.500
right, yeah. All right, this center was 
established in 1979 in this location on Highway 21

27:41.324 --> 27:46.452
West. No, it was originally in town. And when was it 
established? Where was it? Originally. Well,

27:55.546 --> 28:04.299
this sort of gets into why the center was 
established. I suppose we might as well address

28:04.319 --> 28:09.407
that. But let me give you a short answer to the 
question and then come back and fill in, if I may.

28:18.285 --> 28:27.236
The center was established to do technology 
policy work primarily at the national level. The

28:28.638 --> 28:40.272
idea here was that when we say strategic 
technology or strategic research, what we're

28:28.638 --> 28:40.272
talking about is sort of long range stuff. And the 
ideas for the Center, the idea for the Center,

28:40.876 --> 28:51.707
incidentally, well, they started out with a set of 
ideas that I had, which I'll tell you about

28:40.876 --> 28:51.707
shortly. But then when I gave them to my boss, Fred 
Benson, why, he, of course, inserted his own

28:52.407 --> 28:59.174
ideas. So it was sort of an amalgam of the two of us, 
by and large. And his view, in addition to wanting

29:04.459 --> 29:10.545
to do national and international research, was 
also to do state-level research. He felt the state

29:14.069 --> 29:20.357
of Texas was too much crisis-oriented. That is, 
the state would wait until some problem became

29:20.378 --> 29:30.251
enormous, you know, attained crisis 
proportions, and then they would address it. And

29:31.232 --> 29:33.135
so they'd move from crisis to crisis. And his view 
was that we needed to try to identify these

29:33.195 --> 29:41.106
problems when they were still on the horizon. And 
as they came closer to us, and of course some of them

29:41.896 --> 29:55.635
would drop off and some of them would continue to 
increase in enormity, that we would have

29:41.896 --> 29:55.635
solutions that were born of some perspective. not 
a solution that was just sort of patched up

29:56.645 --> 30:02.993
overnight in response to a crisis. That's pretty 
sound thinking, I think. Well, in any event, so

30:05.135 --> 30:15.628
because of his influence, why there was this state 
charter added to the national charter that the

30:05.135 --> 30:15.628
center had. Well, at that time, the Industrial 
Economics Research Division, which had been in

30:16.409 --> 30:25.960
existence for a long, long time, The director had 
resigned, and it had an acting director, and of

30:26.800 --> 30:37.796
course they had done an awful lot of state work 
doing industrial development kinds of things

30:26.800 --> 30:37.796
around over the state. So they had a lot of people 
who knew the state extensively. And so that seemed

30:43.064 --> 30:50.715
to be a kind of a natural horse to ride into the state 
policy arena. Well, they had been set up because of

30:51.083 --> 30:54.908
the space crunch on campus. They had been set up in 
offices at Bryan Place, which is at the corner of

30:54.968 --> 31:01.778
Inwood and Texas Avenue there. And so when the 
center was established, I, as the center, went

31:02.559 --> 31:19.622
over and became the director of the center, and the 
industrial economics division was then made the

31:02.559 --> 31:19.622
industrial economics group within the center, 
you see. And so it was sort of that group that we were

31:20.446 --> 31:23.970
sort of wrapped around. And they were to become our 
state policy group. And then after I got over

31:29.596 --> 31:37.184
there, why, then we added people to fill out a 
defense group, so to speak, and went on from there.

31:37.924 --> 31:44.571
So our first location was there at Bryan Place in 
rented space. And then in January of this year,

31:48.172 --> 32:01.505
this building, which out here at the Research and 
Extension Center, which has been a bit of a

31:48.172 --> 32:01.505
controversial building. I guess we don't 
necessarily need to get into that. But the

32:04.588 --> 32:11.555
building was built without a lot of thought being 
given to who would occupy it. And as a result, it was

32:12.216 --> 32:17.301
largely unoccupied. The TTI people had moved into 
part of it, but this whole wing over here was

32:18.192 --> 32:25.483
vacant. And so, we were ordered to move out here, 
and so we've been out here since January. We will

32:37.059 --> 32:45.111
have space built for us in the new building, the new 
engineering building on campus that's being

32:37.059 --> 32:45.111
built now. And we will move back in there in about 18 
months, or whenever that building is finished.

32:50.977 --> 32:57.946
The reason for that move is that there is a vault 
there for us, and we do classified work. And so we

32:57.966 --> 33:12.803
will

32:57.966 --> 33:12.803
have that facility there in the new building, 
which of course will enhance our research

32:57.966 --> 33:12.803
capabilities quite a lot. So that's pretty much 
the status of the center now. What will happen to

33:15.484 --> 33:19.007
this building when you move back on campus? I don't 
really know. I presume that other university

33:19.808 --> 33:23.311
elements will occupy it. And there's a general 
mood now, I think, to try to make more use of this

33:24.292 --> 33:33.481
research and extension center out here. And it's a 
beautiful place to work, depending on what your

33:34.943 --> 33:43.431
operations are. because I had set up two 
laboratories out here when I was in the Aero

33:43.850 --> 33:48.637
Department back in the 60s.

33:51.942 --> 33:57.711
Its primary limitations are, first of all, it's, 
of course, a long distance to the library. And we

33:58.733 --> 34:03.580
make an awful lot of use of our library here, and 
that is on the campus. And so it's difficult there.

34:07.005 --> 34:12.253
The other thing that is a bit of a problem, the 
center, Although it is based in engineering, it's

34:12.588 --> 34:19.478
part of the engineering experiment station, it 
really is university-wide operation. That is to

34:19.519 --> 34:24.146
say, we have people from business 
administration, from history department.

34:26.830 --> 34:37.486
Well, our view is that we have almost 2,000 
potential staff members, which means that any

34:26.830 --> 34:37.486
faculty member from agriculture to vet medicine 
is fair game for us. And so we will put together

34:37.566 --> 34:42.173
interdisciplinary teams. Too many faculty, 
especially those in business and liberal arts,

34:43.132 --> 34:53.243
being 12 miles from the campus is like being in 
Siberia. And so one encounters difficulty in

34:53.263 --> 35:00.631
getting faculty to come out here, and students, 
too, for that matter. And so those are the two

35:01.812 --> 35:06.737
principal limitations of the location out here. 
Of course, it has advantages. As you notice, we

35:08.660 --> 35:12.784
have no parking problem, and there's no traffic 
problem. That part of it is good, and it's nice and

35:13.304 --> 35:15.928
quiet. But

35:17.471 --> 35:29.751
we do need to be closer to the library, and we do need 
to be closer to our staff members who are the

35:17.471 --> 35:29.751
faculty and graduate students of the university. 
What was originally here before this building was

35:30.492 --> 35:34.839
built? Oh, this was just an open field here. You 
said this was a former air base? Oh, yes. Yeah, it's

35:40.766 --> 35:42.348
a very famous old air base. Yes, Bryan Air Force 
Base. Yes. I'm not sure that I can tell you the full

35:44.752 --> 35:50.020
history of it. Of course, it was active when I was in 
the Air Force, in the Army Air Force then up at Waco.

35:56.810 --> 35:59.994
And it was the Central Instructor School. I'm 
sorry, that's wrong, Central Instrument School.

36:04.047 --> 36:09.472
Back during War II, the U.S. was divided into three 
flying training commands. And this was, of

36:09.552 --> 36:13.395
course, this area of the U.S. was the central 
flying training command. And instrument flying,

36:14.636 --> 36:29.029
that is learning blind flying, as you might call 
it, learning to fly strictly by instruments alone

36:14.636 --> 36:29.029
when you can't, you know, when you're in a cloud and 
you can't see out of the airplane, you can't see the

36:14.636 --> 36:29.029
ground, you can't see anything. Instrument 
flying, of course, had been developed in a

36:34.034 --> 36:41.241
rudimentary fashion in the mid-'30s, or by the 
mid-'30s, I should say. And of course, it was

36:41.982 --> 36:50.430
essential that Air Force pilots know how to fly on 
instruments. And so in each one of the flying

36:50.450 --> 36:57.557
training commands, there was a central, that is, 
there was an instrument school. And all the pilots

36:58.799 --> 37:03.163
learned how to fly on instruments through that 
school. Bryan Air Force Base here was that school

37:03.481 --> 37:07.505
for the Central Flying Training Command. And so 
you'll find an awful lot of old-time Air Force

37:08.206 --> 37:15.773
pilots who remember when this was an active Air 
Force base back during World War II. And then I

37:16.834 --> 37:23.420
believe it was closed briefly right after World 
War II and then reopened. And when it was reopened,

37:24.401 --> 37:30.687
this one must have been in the late 40s or early 50s, 
perhaps at the time of the Korean thing. Then they

37:31.409 --> 37:41.018
came in and built two new runways, 7,700 foot 
runways, parallel runways out on the Air Force

37:31.409 --> 37:41.018
base here to handle jet aircraft. And they came in 
and built these new dormitories or relatively new

37:42.200 --> 37:49.747
dorms over here and reactivated the base. And

37:50.047 --> 37:56.734
of course at that time they built an auxiliary 
field up at Hearn. I don't know whether you've ever

37:57.014 --> 37:58.075
seen what we affectionately refer to as Hearn 
International Airport. But it is, again, I think

38:02.075 --> 38:13.366
about a 6,000 or 7,000 foot runway, a beautiful 
runway, far more than what the city of Hearn would

38:02.075 --> 38:13.366
have built to meet its airport needs. But that was 
an auxiliary field for this Air Force base here.

38:17.971 --> 38:24.057
And the students would go up there and practice 
landings and takeoffs and that sort of thing. And

38:24.097 --> 38:25.378
then in 1958,

38:28.852 --> 38:30.113
No, that's wrong. In 1962, I

38:30.173 --> 38:38.882
guess maybe the Air Force base was closed in 58. I'm 
not really sure. There are natives around here

38:40.364 --> 38:43.828
that can give you more detail on this than I can. But 
about 1962, there was an agreement between the

38:43.908 --> 38:55.119
federal government and Texas A&M that A&M would 
buy this place over the next 20 years. And it's a

38:55.720 --> 38:57.542
rather interesting arrangement, When Texas A&M 
gives them, each year they would make an

38:58.282 --> 39:11.161
installment payment, the General Services 
Administration, the federal government, would

38:58.282 --> 39:11.161
deed 1 20th of the land to Texas A&M. Well, in 1982, 
next year, we will make our final payment, and the

39:11.782 --> 39:23.800
old Air Force Base then will be totally Texas A&M's 
property.

39:24.860 --> 39:34.594
So when I came down here in 64,

39:24.860 --> 39:34.594
there were a few operations

39:24.860 --> 39:34.594
out here. Of course, TTI had had their, you know, 
had started their transportation research work

39:34.614 --> 39:43.867
with automobiles, and the ramp and the runways 
were ideal for that. But the runways had been

39:46.531 --> 39:53.601
fenced off, and the veterinary medicine people 
had horses out there.

39:54.577 --> 40:06.493
Well, you have to understand that when aviation 
has been as much of your life as it has been of mine,

39:54.577 --> 40:06.493
that there's nothing sadder than, there's only 
one thing sadder than to see an abandoned airport,

39:54.577 --> 40:06.493
and that's to see an abandoned airplane. And so we,

40:07.695 --> 40:21.394
when I, of course, I was brought down here to start a 
research program in the Department of Aerospace

40:07.695 --> 40:21.394
Engineering because they did not have one. And 
that was one of the things that I had been pretty

40:22.218 --> 40:31.431
good at at Ohio State, was going out and raising 
money from the outside for research programs. And

40:31.451 --> 40:45.791
so when I came down here and wanted to set up a 
high-speed aerodynamics program similar to what

40:31.451 --> 40:45.791
we'd had up at Ohio State, why, the question was, 
well, where are you going to house that? And so

40:47.113 --> 40:50.858
there was a building given to me out here to house 
that facility. And then we eventually also

40:53.634 --> 41:07.254
reopened one of the hangars over here and set up a 
flight mechanics laboratory to do actual flight

40:53.634 --> 41:07.254
test work to make use of the runways and the 
facilities out here. And so it was an old Air Force

41:08.536 --> 41:14.905
base, and of course you can still see a lot of the 
trappings of that. The hangars, many of the

41:15.644 --> 41:26.923
hangars, a couple of the hangars over there were 
built as temporary hangars back in, I don't know

41:15.644 --> 41:26.923
when, 1940, 42, I guess, at the start of World War 
II. And they're, well they've deteriorated a

41:27.945 --> 41:36.460
little bit, but not a great deal. They're still in 
pretty good shape.

41:40.450 --> 41:52.261
course having been around Air Force bases during 
that period of time I can see a lot of similarity

41:40.450 --> 41:52.261
between the way this place looks now and what the 
Air Force bases looked like back in those days.

41:55.504 --> 42:05.133
Okay could you tell me something about your 
specific duties today as director about how many

41:55.504 --> 42:05.133
people do you supervise how many employees in the 
strategic technology section? Well

42:09.728 --> 42:16.178
It's rather difficult to pin down because we're in 
the process of changing our organizational

42:09.728 --> 42:16.178
structure. Six to eight months ago, we had about 40 
people in the center, and now industrial

42:17.760 --> 42:28.356
economics has been split off again, and it's no 
longer part of the center. There is an education

42:30.359 --> 42:34.065
group. an outfit from the College of Education 
that has been a part of the center now for about a

42:35.092 --> 42:46.723
year, but its activities will terminate in the 
center in September, and so they will split off. So

42:46.823 --> 43:04.660
taking account of these things that have happened 
and will happen in the next few weeks, we'll end up

42:46.823 --> 43:04.660
with about, well, including faculty who are 
involved with us on a part-time basis, about 20 uh

43:05.517 --> 43:10.060
20 people all right could we pause here just a 
moment
