WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:06.046
And all the wild ones, all jungle. And we'd see 
kangaroos, lots of them. And somebody had a horse

00:13.075 --> 00:30.377
out there, and this horse had a, its back looked 
like it was broken or something. It had a, you know,

00:30.397 --> 00:33.261
a dip like this. And we knew it was the G.I. that had 
gone over there with a paint, a can of white paint,

00:36.503 --> 00:42.933
and for twenty grand. Remember there was a race car 
that was twenty grand? And we just said, boy,

00:46.298 --> 00:49.102
someone's been up there ahead of us. And so 
finally, We went to Brisbane, Brisbane,

00:52.917 --> 00:56.804
Australia. Well, we didn't stop there. We had to go 
farther up, and we noticed that the black G.I.s,

01:00.452 --> 01:15.280
they either were They had them fixing up pontoon 
bridges to get across some river or body of water.

01:24.196 --> 01:26.878
And the other truck drivers were water master. And 
boy, I tell you, there was a shortage of food, a

01:28.239 --> 01:35.686
shortage of everything in Australia. So the black 
drivers, you know, they started to meet some of the

01:36.487 --> 01:43.393
women there. And they used this when they found out 
that they needed this. We'd go over there and

01:48.691 --> 01:54.159
somebody had brooms that weren't available and 
canned food. And so it wasn't long before those

01:54.880 --> 02:04.775
black guys were fraternizing with the women. And 
we went to a movie. It was only at night. Couldn't go

02:10.407 --> 02:11.488
any daytime. And went to see a black GI with a white 
woman. And the woman would have had a baby. And they

02:22.341 --> 02:27.046
were sitting there, and they had the baby covered 
so nobody could see that it was black, you know. But

02:27.807 --> 02:31.571
mixed up with that, I mean, hey, that's the way it 
goes. And we didn't make too. So then we got to

02:33.834 --> 02:38.119
Townsville, Australia. And that was our base. And 
so we had a supply depot there, and it came over from

02:42.920 --> 02:49.376
Kelly. It was the fourth air depot.

02:54.063 --> 02:56.887
They had all kind of supplies, you know. By that I 
mean they had tools, carpenter's tools, anything

02:59.210 --> 03:12.570
that was needed to set up a camp, pipe, fittings, 
this kind of thing. And so it was pretty good. And

03:16.856 --> 03:18.659
you were in the Army Air Corps. That's right. 
Officially. United States Army Air Corps. And how

03:21.342 --> 03:23.125
long were you all in Australia? I think it was about 
a year. And then where? We moved up to Port Moresby

03:29.929 --> 03:34.055
in New Guinea. In New Guinea. And how long there? 
Well, we kept moving. We were there at Moresby

03:39.683 --> 03:43.909
maybe six or eight months. And then we moved on to 
Dubbedura and to the Markham Valley down toward

03:45.431 --> 03:54.985
L.A. L.A.E. L.A.E.

04:01.145 --> 04:02.667
But we didn't go to L.A. Instead we went north to 
Hollandia. New Guinea is divided Papua on the

04:07.655 --> 04:14.246
bottom half and Dutch New Guinea at the top.

04:17.030 --> 04:19.875
So it was It was just a supply organization because 
we were handling small arms and also we were taking

04:20.648 --> 04:30.839
ammunition. And we had to set up ammunition dumps. 
So you're down there in the South Pacific through

04:34.963 --> 04:38.587
the end of the war? Oh, yes. All right. Yes. So after 
there, MacArthur had ordered a new move, come out

04:50.281 --> 05:02.859
And we went to Biak, B-I-A-K. And there was a

04:50.281 --> 05:02.859
Japanese bastion, if you will. And there was a lot 
of caves. And they would use P-38s and P-40s to

05:07.165 --> 05:16.018
strafe those holes or these openings, see, 
because they'd bring out their cannon. and they

05:16.623 --> 05:20.510
fired and then they cut it back inside, you see. So 
we had to use those planes because we couldn't

05:20.530 --> 05:25.138
climb up there. It was too steep. So we were out 
there on Biak setting up a bomb dump. I remember

05:34.856 --> 05:38.142
this because that's when we started getting 
opposition. We

05:39.050 --> 05:44.758
had to set up revetments. We had bulldozers in our 
company, so we had to put up revetments to prevent

05:44.919 --> 05:54.994
the ammunition to blow up because of a fire. Okay? 
And we were working 24 hours a day. And at night we

06:01.477 --> 06:03.380
had some portable lamps. And we knew that the 
Japanese were watching us. And so at night the

06:08.550 --> 06:17.886
Japanese would come out, because MacArthur was 
bypassing some of those islands. And those

06:19.269 --> 06:23.316
Japanese stragglers were, they were starving. 
and they'd sneak into our camp area. And we had our

06:27.173 --> 06:31.698
laundry on the line, next morning it was gone. And 
we had a tent where we were storing canned goods,

06:33.680 --> 06:39.306
and we knew somebody had been here. So we'd lay for 
them at night, and we never could catch them. And

06:48.036 --> 06:49.017
even though The lights were, the moon, there was 
plenty of light. It was almost like early morning.

06:59.818 --> 07:04.508
You could see.

07:05.483 --> 07:13.534
Our orders were, it says, when you retire, you stay 
in your tent, you don't go out, or the sentries,

07:05.483 --> 07:13.534
they're going to fire on you. Well, nothing really 
happened that would, you know, when we got any

07:13.554 --> 07:19.021
injuries on our side. So after BIAC, there was a 
place called Wewak, and that was a strong base. of

07:33.513 --> 07:34.254
Japanese. So MacArthur figured, hey, we can take 
Wewak. We're going to lose some people. So what we

07:40.402 --> 07:44.847
do is just bypass them and isolate them.

07:48.192 --> 07:48.552
Okay. I want to back up on this one something.

07:55.221 --> 07:58.765
The Japanese, this was in March of 1943. The 
Japanese wanted to come into New Guinea and take it

08:03.601 --> 08:05.384
over. And the plan was the Japanese wanted to take 
over Port Moresby and then use that as a Japanese

08:06.666 --> 08:18.885
base to jump and take over Australia. And General 
Kenny says, no way. And MacArthur agreed with him.

08:24.895 --> 08:27.118
I'm talking about General George Kenny. He was a 
little guy, but he knew He knew his business. So he

08:33.236 --> 08:41.788
had reconnaissance planes flying through 
squalls, through storms, and to see them. And

08:41.808 --> 08:58.532
over, I don't know how far it was, but there was a big 
base named Rabaul, R-A-B-A-U-L. And they were

08:41.808 --> 08:58.532
building up Rabaul with troops and ships to come 
in. and going to Port Moresby. They had tried to

09:02.016 --> 09:06.701
land at Lay and go over the old Stanley Range. And it 
was too steep and it was just jungle. And they

09:13.909 --> 09:14.669
couldn't make it. And then there was a lot of 
poisonous snakes and so forth. So they gave up that

09:19.134 --> 09:23.118
idea that they're not going to go across the old 
Stanley Range. It's a string of mountains.

09:27.250 --> 09:32.295
and go by ship and take over more space and bypass 
everything else that's in between. Okay. Madame

09:35.418 --> 09:40.422
McArthur got the word, 22-ship convoy coming out 
of Rabaul. Later it was refuted by Admiral Emmets,

09:41.543 --> 09:49.911
but there were six battleships. I don't know 
exactly what they were, but they were cruisers and

09:51.493 --> 09:56.177
destroyers. that were, they were escorting the 
troop ships. And when Kenny got the word that

10:03.439 --> 10:11.471
they're on their way, he says, I want everything 
that can fly. And man, I tell you, we were day and

10:12.293 --> 10:16.099
night loading up those planes. And the Aussies, 
apparently the Aussies were the only ones that had

10:17.341 --> 10:24.612
these flying Catalinas. He said, I want every 
Catalina up there to pick up our fliers if they're

10:25.283 --> 10:31.373
down. OK? And so I said, all right. So our Air Force 
was already looking for them. And they found them.

10:43.654 --> 10:44.595
And they started bombing. And there was a, I can't 
think of the man's name.

10:51.963 --> 11:01.539
He was an officer in the Air Force with the Air 
Corps, and he was the one that, I say, I want to use

10:51.963 --> 11:01.539
the word, who invented skip bombing. See? Okay? 
You know when you take a flat piece of rock and you

11:03.582 --> 11:08.991
toss it and it goes, okay. And they got this, he had a 
squadron of B-25s. And they used the B-25s that

11:14.821 --> 11:18.527
would come down just at, just above the water. And 
they'd spawn a troop ship and they would drop this

11:21.170 --> 11:28.678
bomb. And let it bounce toward the troop ship. 
Right, exactly. And they had daisy cutters on the

11:33.383 --> 11:35.265
end. Now a daisy cutter is a fuse. The fuses that 
were used in the bombs were two types. One that fit

11:46.716 --> 11:48.278
in the nose want to fit in the tail. If the fuse in the 
nose failed, the one in the back would discharge

11:51.329 --> 11:57.358
them. Now, before some G.I. decided there was a 
need to use these bombs for anti-personnel, and

12:04.889 --> 12:15.345
they wanted the bomb to explode above the ground. 
And because when the bomb would hit the ground, it

12:16.169 --> 12:23.438
would go down maybe five or six feet, and then they 
would explode. But the effect was not what they

12:23.858 --> 12:26.982
wanted. So this guy decided, this G.I. said, hey, 
why don't we extend that fuse? And they called it a

12:33.990 --> 12:35.191
daisy cutter. And when the bomb hits the ground, 
it'll go off above the ground. And that's what they

12:41.482 --> 12:45.427
used on those bombs to hit the ship. When they hit 
the ship, it made a gaping hole and the water rushed

12:45.968 --> 12:50.914
in. And then there were another squadron of B-25s. 
They had a 75-millimeter cannon in the nose, okay?

12:59.084 --> 13:09.818
And just when you had the briefings, you know, they 
had 50 calibers. on the side, and there were gates

13:10.827 --> 13:19.335
that where the tracers would meet would be 200 
yards. So whenever the tracers would cross on the

13:20.776 --> 13:34.669
target, they let the .25-mm cannon take off, and 
the recoil just slowed down the B-25. Well,

13:35.850 --> 13:38.252
anyway, according to the reports we got, the 
battle lasted about 20 minutes, and every ship was

13:39.464 --> 13:46.832
sunk. Is this the Battle of the Coral Sea? No. The 
Battle of the Bismarck Sea. Oh, Bismarck Sea. 3

13:54.041 --> 13:55.182
March 1943. Okay. Now, the Navy was over there, 
close by, for support if they needed. And you know

14:04.853 --> 14:06.855
when you when the ship goes down. There's always a 
lot of debris in the water, records, papers and

14:08.944 --> 14:14.250
stuff like that. So, Battle of Nimitz boys, they 
picked up everything they could, see. And

14:19.957 --> 14:26.585
MacArthur had already had a report prior to the 
battle that there was a 22-ship convoy. Well,

14:27.547 --> 14:35.256
Nimitz's boys got a log that said, it's only 16. So 
he brought it over to McCarthy and says, hey,

14:35.658 --> 14:39.822
you've been saying this is a 22-ship convoy. You 
saw it. You only saw 16. And they got into a

14:42.865 --> 14:43.987
squabble. And somebody in Washington told them to 
back off and leave McCarthy alone. Do you know

14:50.053 --> 14:52.475
about that? Oh, I tell you. And so I left that one 
part about when the hostilities started, and

14:54.277 --> 15:03.707
General Kennedy came down. they had a general 
there named Strademeyer. And Strademeyer was, I

15:07.345 --> 15:18.875
can't think of a word to describe him, but he was 
kind of easy going, slow, and all he had was

15:07.345 --> 15:18.875
reconnaissance flights, that's all. And when 
General Kennedy came over, he wanted to go back and

15:19.536 --> 15:24.460
fight the Nips. And he ran into,

15:25.822 --> 15:32.648
Strademeyer was blocking it, I'll use that word. 
And so General Kinney, he went on to MacArthur and

15:33.202 --> 15:44.376
said, look, I came over here to fight a war, and I 
want to get those nymphs home. Are you going to let

15:44.396 --> 15:51.264
me run that air war, or are you going to let us spend 
them on her? And the word was really out. MacArthur

15:52.986 --> 15:55.429
never had anybody talk to him like that. And he 
said, okay, George, take it over. And he said,

15:59.606 --> 16:01.888
spend a mile back in the States or somewhere. And he 
was out. So General Kennedy took over everything.

16:06.873 --> 16:22.787
And he was the one that had those 6x6s and 4x4 trucks 
cut and put half the front end in a C-47, fired up

16:06.873 --> 16:22.787
there, and then the other part in another plane. 
And the people up in New Guinea, those vehicles

16:25.598 --> 16:26.820
over here? I don't see no boats coming in to unload 
them." Oh, they walked down the road. And back in

16:35.510 --> 16:45.683
Townsville, when the whacks came in, you know, the 
whacks, the women, and they were going to a big

16:35.510 --> 16:45.683
dance. You don't have to put this down, but the, 
the, the black G.I.s, they wanted to go out there

16:50.675 --> 16:54.821
and beat the whacks, see. And

16:56.083 --> 17:09.241
they went over there, and the other Anglo G.I.s, 
they didn't want the black G.I.s to dance with us.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.766
And it was a big fight, and they cut the dancers out.

17:16.071 --> 17:16.952
We had to at

17:17.894 --> 17:23.722
the airstrip. We had a place where they had the 
planes parked, you know. And some of those girls

17:27.347 --> 17:29.289
were over there. And somebody said, you know what, 
I think those women were prostitutes before they

17:29.309 --> 17:38.762
got in there, because there was something going on 
over there on those parked planes. Do you get my

17:39.563 --> 17:40.504
drift? Okay. And it was something, I tell you. And 
well, After this battle of the Bismarck Sea, that

17:47.915 --> 17:54.583
killed everything for the Japanese. They 
couldn't get to Fort Moresby. So finally they put

17:56.945 --> 18:05.395
us aboard LSTs and we went into Manila. And we were 
at what used to be Clark Field. And then there was

18:12.890 --> 18:15.774
Fort Stottsenburg. It was messed up. I mean, it was 
bombed and everything else. And then there was

18:21.082 --> 18:22.304
Nichols Field. Nichols Field was a smaller 
operation than Clark. And so we were there,

18:27.171 --> 18:35.843
stationed at Clark, again setting up our 
ammunition, setting up on top of small arms

18:36.397 --> 18:39.301
weapons. And

18:40.563 --> 18:47.754
we hired, well we didn't do it, the quarter marshal 
did. They hired work battalions of local people to

18:48.595 --> 18:57.349
police up the areas and do this and so forth. And 
there was a group that could speak Spanish. So I got

19:03.418 --> 19:05.661
around. I was friends with them. These were 
Filipinos? Yes, Filipinos.

19:16.119 --> 19:22.232
There were some girls that would come around with 
their brothers to pick up laundry. And, you know,

19:22.600 --> 19:31.509
there's always a GI that wants to get, you know, put 
their hands on them and say, no, no, Filipino

19:22.600 --> 19:31.509
customs, no touch. And there were trucks going 
back and forth for the unloading ships, the docks,

19:32.170 --> 19:42.880
back to camp. And some of these Filipinos wanted to 
get someplace, and they would stand on the highway

19:43.961 --> 19:52.590
trying to get a ride. But the GI wouldn't stop. So 
these fellas says, you know, let's put the girl

19:55.442 --> 20:01.310
over there, and we hide in the bush. And when he 
stopped, we jumped. And we tell them, we tell them,

20:04.935 --> 20:09.040
we want the girl to sit over here with us in the front 
seat. And that's the way they got, you know, go back

20:09.861 --> 20:15.148
and forth. And let's see, then we have, when we got 
to Manila, then we went to Okinawa. And let's see,

20:22.912 --> 20:39.455
Okinawa, we were, we had, when we wanted some fish, 
we'd go to the Quartermaster and get a duck. A duck

20:40.376 --> 20:43.721
was one of those vehicles that looked like a boat. 
You could go in the water. And we wanted to go fish,

20:45.760 --> 20:54.268
but we didn't know where to fish, and we didn't know 
which were the good fish, because that was

20:45.760 --> 20:54.268
poisonous fish. So we got one of the natives, and

20:54.969 --> 21:02.836
he had a sixth sense. He could tell where the fish 
were. So he says, that way, it's right here. And we

21:08.121 --> 21:09.423
get hand grenades, see it? And we throw them in the 
water. And pretty soon, and that was the fish. And

21:15.359 --> 21:16.680
we'd have a fish fry. And we got an allowance of 
beer, six cans of beer a month. And we didn't care

21:24.309 --> 21:30.956
who made the beer, just a little beer. And how did 
you cool it? Well, we had some ammunition boxes,

21:32.638 --> 21:37.143
all metal. And we'd take, you remember those 
aerosol bombs for mosquitoes? We put the cancer

21:43.068 --> 21:46.574
beer in there, and one of these pumped it up. And 
hey, we closed the lid, and we had some cold beers.

21:53.225 --> 21:54.347
Some were not satisfied. They'd get some peaches 
or apple or something, let it ferment, you know,

21:54.387 --> 22:03.463
and they called it jungle juice, and then get drunk 
on that. Well, anyway. Where were you when you

22:05.787 --> 22:08.772
heard about the atom bomb? Where were you when you 
heard about the atom bomb? The atomic bomb? Oh, the

22:14.863 --> 22:15.643
atom bomb. Okay. In Okinawa. We were in Okinawa. 
And we saw our first B-29. And we thought it was a

22:23.211 --> 22:26.054
monster, see? Because we were used to seeing P-38s 
and P-40s. And the fighter pilots had a preference

22:31.340 --> 22:39.568
for P-38s because we said, hey, if we If one of our 
engines goes out, we can come back on the other one.

22:44.741 --> 22:46.623
We had a pilot named Richard Bong. He flew P-38s. He 
was a daring old fool. And General Kenney grounded

22:54.432 --> 22:56.254
him. He had 40 kills to his credit. And he knew that 
he had hit others that probably didn't make it to

22:59.558 --> 23:06.686
their base, but they gave him credit for 40. And 
someone says, How is it that Bong can shoot so many

23:10.919 --> 23:20.314
airplanes while Neil Kirby and the other two were 
just way behind him? He says, well, what he does, he

23:21.416 --> 23:26.785
flies right up to the plane and lets go of those 
450s. And he's taking too many chances because

23:28.788 --> 23:34.737
that Japanese pilot may have a wingman or 
something that'll come in. Finally, they got Mr.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.243
Bong. But we went back to the States, and he was 
found in one of the first jet planes. And he

23:44.253 --> 23:44.934
crashed. Garrett, with a lot, you have a call on 
line one. Garrett, with a lot, you have a call on

23:48.397 --> 23:51.561
line one. Oh. And so when the atomic bomb was 
dropped and everything, they started releasing

23:53.944 --> 24:04.996
the guys that had the most time overseas. Where did 
you all hear? Where were you when you heard about

24:07.805 --> 24:10.788
that bomb being dropped? Naha, Okinawa. And what 
was your reaction? What did you all think? Was it a

24:14.212 --> 24:15.093
surprise? Well, yes, we were surprised and we were 
happy because now we're going home. And who's

24:20.460 --> 24:21.541
going home? The guys that have been here the most, 
the longest. With the point system? Yeah, point

24:27.027 --> 24:28.970
system. So when did you get back to San Antonio?

24:33.515 --> 24:36.158
That's a good question.

24:39.293 --> 24:42.077
The twenty-fifth day of October, 1945. That's 
right. And you started back to work when? Well, let

24:49.729 --> 24:50.530
me see. I didn't start back to work

24:50.590 --> 24:57.922
goodnight. It must have been In late January. Of 
46? Yeah. And what job did you get? The same job I had

25:09.395 --> 25:10.977
before. And

25:11.438 --> 25:24.136
so they were, it was still the same old place, but 
there was a shortage of parts. I remember that.

25:26.324 --> 25:44.906
And, but, yeah, now, Mr. Feeble was just glad to get 
me back, and he, you see, the veterans, if you

25:26.324 --> 25:44.906
recall, they would give them preference to give 
them their old jobs back, see, and I just fit it in,

25:26.324 --> 25:44.906
just. When did you meet this special young lady? 
Well, that's another story. When I was up there at

25:51.814 --> 25:54.137
Payne Field, there was this fellow, Richard 
Bazan. And of course, going up there to Everett,

25:58.196 --> 26:07.449
Washington, there was hardly any Hispanics over 
there. And in our company, we had, let's see, one,

26:08.510 --> 26:15.620
two, three, three. And one of them, two of them were 
from San Antonio, one from Beeville. And this

26:21.252 --> 26:31.479
fellow,

26:21.252 --> 26:31.479
I forget his name now, he was real dark, and he could 
pass for an Indian. So when we go to Town Hall Pass,

26:35.191 --> 26:38.634
somebody, oh, I'll stop at some bridge, you know, 
and get a couple of beers. And the bartender will

26:39.895 --> 26:49.644
look at this guy, and he refused to serve him beer, 
because he says, in Washington, it's against the

26:39.895 --> 26:49.644
law to sell beer to Indians. No, he's not. So one of 
us had to buy the beer, didn't give it to him. He

26:54.448 --> 26:56.049
says, don't let him see you drinking it. Okay. So, 
uh, the, uh, uh, Mr. Feller, Richard Poisson from

26:58.251 --> 27:04.877
Bealeville, on mail calling, he would get 
letters, you see, and here I am, and nobody was

27:05.600 --> 27:09.865
writing to me. And so I was the same. You recall, 
there was the newspapers building up to promote

27:13.289 --> 27:19.757
pen pals. You don't know them, but they write, tell 
you what's going on at home. So they gave me five

27:24.904 --> 27:28.548
names, and I wrote to the girls. Hey, I got some 
answers. It was fine. And this kept up. Finally,

27:35.823 --> 27:39.087
Four of them kind of slowed down, you know, and they 
quit. But Rachel, my wife, she kept on riding. All

27:43.291 --> 27:46.435
during the war, she kept on riding, answering my 
rail. And you had not seen her yet? No. We were

27:48.637 --> 27:49.378
strangers. And she had an aunt in San Antonio that 
she would visit on. And I said, would you give my

27:54.083 --> 28:01.351
mother a call or visit with her and tell her that 
we're riding and I'm OK? So that kind of gave her

28:01.431 --> 28:05.155
some sense of relief Yes. So she'd go over there and 
visit with my mother. So when I came home, you see, I

28:09.718 --> 28:21.392
said, I got to meet that lady and thank her for what 
she'd done and for writing to me and all this, you

28:09.718 --> 28:21.392
see. And that was all. I was going to say thank you, 
goodbye, but something happened there, you see. I

28:29.923 --> 28:30.784
can't describe it. When I started to get off the 
bus, I said, you know, I like what I see. And so I took

28:36.585 --> 28:40.169
her out. First I went to see her aunt and get her 
blessings, you know, that they would allow for me

28:40.810 --> 28:48.238
to take her out and suffer. I brought her back in a 
decent hour. And I would visit with her when she

28:52.563 --> 28:56.968
would come to. Or I would, I had to borrow a car. from 
the company, you know, as an old 41 Chevrolet. And

29:04.347 --> 29:09.973
I'd drive all the way to Beville, which was about 90 
miles from San Antonio. And I'd go there and visit

29:10.934 --> 29:12.355
with them. And so one thing led to the other, you 
know. And so I asked her to marry me, and she said

29:17.401 --> 29:22.206
yes. When did you all get married? Fifteenth day of 
December, 1945. Forty-five or six? Forty-five.

29:34.568 --> 29:36.070
This was a quick thing now. Oh, okay. See, because I 
got out in October. Okay. October the 25th. So you

29:40.837 --> 29:43.040
got married in less than two months. Yeah. And so I 
had heard gossip, Richard's getting married, it

29:44.021 --> 29:50.651
won't last. She hardly knows the boy, and vice 
versa. Well, it was something because the other

29:55.160 --> 30:12.599
girls, her sisters, she had five sisters, and they 
got married, and their marriages broke up except

29:55.160 --> 30:12.599
on one. They sold it together. But on our marriage, 
they didn't give it, we said, it's not going to

30:14.801 --> 30:20.528
last. So she moved to San Antonio. and you 
continued your job, and then what caused you to

30:23.780 --> 30:29.989
start thinking about going to college? Well, I 
knew General Motors parts like an open book. I had a

30:39.243 --> 30:51.542
good memory to remember, and you know, every year 
when the new models come in, They always,

30:52.180 --> 31:00.648
something goes wrong, the heat indicator doesn't 
work, the speedometer doesn't work, or

30:52.180 --> 31:00.648
whatever. There's a defective part, and under the 
warranty that's placed on the car, the dealer's

31:01.009 --> 31:12.060
supposed to replace it, see? And then the dealer 
would get it back to these defective parts and

31:12.080 --> 31:19.707
sends them back to the factory and gets...
