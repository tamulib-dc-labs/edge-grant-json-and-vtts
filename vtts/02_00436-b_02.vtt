WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:02.424
assigned a job. So he took care of us and showed us 
around the city.

00:07.850 --> 00:09.572
It's a typical Chinese city. It does have many more 
tall buildings in it, like a typical forested

00:10.853 --> 00:16.660
city. I think of it sort of like Hong Kong. It has a 
huge building right at the confluence of the

00:20.484 --> 00:24.168
Yangtze and some other river. I forget the name of 
it. It runs into the Yangtze River right there.

00:26.891 --> 00:27.992
Maybe Yellow River or something. Right at the 
confluence. deep canyons into these riverbeds,

00:30.085 --> 00:34.510
huge deep canyons. Oh, the rivers look like the 
Mississippi River, don't they? And there's caves

00:38.455 --> 00:41.058
in the hillside. It's very hilly on the mountains. 
And not rock, yeah, but sort of like a limestone.

00:48.887 --> 00:55.755
And there's just innumerable number of caves and 
holes and revetments and bomb shelters all

00:48.887 --> 00:55.755
throughout the city. And we're, you know, the 
people who've been going for years because we

00:56.326 --> 01:00.833
haven't even bombed it yet. They were used to it. 
And sirens, the wailing sirens, you know, for bomb

01:01.974 --> 01:05.419
alerts and all. The business was sort of as usual, 
you know, in China. People were used to it. Again,

01:11.949 --> 01:17.116
like ants for many of them, just millions of 
people. And, of course, we'd drive in. There were

01:19.359 --> 01:21.783
other American cars there. I don't remember 
seeing any other Americans there. in the place,

01:26.026 --> 01:36.435
except at the embassy I met General Burton, Army 
Air Corps, Air Force officer at that time, major.

01:37.216 --> 01:38.477
No, he was a general at that time. I had an interview 
with him trying to get a regular commission in the

01:38.617 --> 01:42.701
Air Force. I determined to get that regular 
commission in the Air Force. What did he say? You

01:48.446 --> 01:51.769
ever hear of General Bruce Holloway, who 
commanded SAC before he retired? Bruce Holloway

01:52.910 --> 01:54.852
is a very close friend of mine. He was

01:55.253 --> 02:05.944
a major then, and he was with the American military 
mission into China. That's the first time I met

02:05.964 --> 02:08.307
him. We knew that pretty soon the AVD was going to be 
dissolved, or the Air Force was going to take us

02:09.128 --> 02:16.275
over. Many of us were talking about, well, we'd be 
staying. China and go in the Air Force there, or did

02:21.224 --> 02:26.710
we have a belly full of stuff and want to go home, or 
what? And we were continuing talking about it, and

02:26.730 --> 02:29.673
everybody had a different opinion. The only 
thing, I want to do anything that would get me a

02:29.693 --> 02:33.037
regular commission. That's what I want to do. So 
you went in and talked to him? So I asked for a

02:36.240 --> 02:46.191
conference with General Burton through Bruce 
Holloway, and I went in, he gave me a conference, I

02:36.240 --> 02:46.191
went in and sat down and talked to him. I guess I 
explained the situation and talked to him about 30

02:46.211 --> 02:49.695
minutes. Very attentive, just as nice as he could 
be. When I got through, his only comment, he says,

02:52.585 --> 03:00.094
well, and I think he called me just Mr. Bond. Yeah, I 
wasn't. I was out of the military as Mr. Bond. I'm

03:04.540 --> 03:08.305
sorry, I understand what you're saying, but only 
Congress can do what you want to do. In other words,

03:08.866 --> 03:13.191
you take a congressional act to give me a regular 
commission. I said, well, if that's the way it is, I

03:13.211 --> 03:16.155
think I'll just go on home. I was very disappointed 
and a little bit mad. I could see my plan, I could see

03:22.768 --> 03:28.534
my plan going to the dogs. Here I was, already 
almost a double ace, combat experience, shot down

03:28.554 --> 03:36.041
once, and still had scars on my face.

03:38.704 --> 03:42.468
The Air Force building up now, and the experience 
and all. So, old Bruce Holloway later on told me, I

03:42.868 --> 03:46.952
met him years later, and he told me that when I left, 
he said, General Byrne came out and he said, there

03:47.236 --> 03:59.698
is a man that really wants a regular commission.

04:00.218 --> 04:09.835
And get back to the city, that's, we had ice cream 
there for the first time, had ice cream and

04:00.218 --> 04:09.835
hamburgers, and that was out of this world, and 
then Again, we stayed on alert there for a while,

04:11.114 --> 04:16.163
but did nothing and pretty soon it got boring. I saw 
the old man a lot up there because it was for

04:16.223 --> 04:27.122
international planning and strategy and war 
playing and all between the nations was going on.

04:28.464 --> 04:34.675
Now they were free from Japanese bombing, so the 
old man did most of his work there. It was soon after

04:35.026 --> 04:37.930
that that we had to get into it again. The old man 
laid a plan on it, of course, to go down to Kwai Lin

04:37.971 --> 04:42.357
with another trick. Okay, now where's that? Kwai 
Lin is here. Okay, that's... It's southeast of

04:50.129 --> 04:53.474
Chongqing. K-W-E-I-L-I-N. Okay, that is... Down 
toward Hong Kong. Toward Canton and Hong Kong. All

04:58.161 --> 04:59.824
right. Okay, now what was... When was that and what 
was the plan? So the idea of that was, as I told you,

05:03.916 --> 05:16.835
the Japanese had reoriented their strategy to 
take China from the coast and just hold what they

05:03.916 --> 05:16.835
had in Burma. So they started to drive. They were 
already in the northern part of China, and they

05:20.561 --> 05:27.291
started to drive from the

05:37.261 --> 05:38.743
That says Wuhan. It's a

05:38.763 --> 05:46.553
toilet drive from the Wuhan, W-H-A-N area. It was 
called another name then. Anyway.

05:53.523 --> 05:54.985
And their drive was toward Chongqing? They were 
going to drive straight down and take Wei Lin. Oh,

05:58.029 --> 05:59.271
they were moving south. And split this part from 
that part. Because the rail, the big rail head,

06:03.552 --> 06:08.236
goes all the way down to Southeast Agency. Okay, so 
they were going to take down. So that would split

06:11.139 --> 06:12.881
off China. Hancao. Hancao was the name of that, 
Wuhan. Okay, and so that would cut off... That

06:15.283 --> 06:18.846
split China. Yeah, north and south. Okay. Okay. 
And we were going to... The plan was to move most of

06:26.533 --> 06:30.437
its forces... and I do mean most of them, to 
Hualien. Now, this was a huge air base that the

06:32.980 --> 06:45.234
Chinese had been building for some time, just like 
the huge one-way, and I told you about it, Kunming,

06:32.980 --> 06:45.234
in expectation of eventually having bombers 
there. The old man planted that. It was an ideal,

06:47.036 --> 06:54.044
beautiful layout for operations of aircraft, 
except only the one-way approach to the field. The

06:54.104 --> 06:56.627
other end was these huge mountains there. It 
looked like ice cream cones turned upside down all

06:56.647 --> 07:01.032
over it. It's a beautiful, luxurious valley. It's 
where they usually take the VIP visitors to see

07:04.072 --> 07:10.262
part of China. They take them down that river. 
That's where Nixon was taken, by the way, when he

07:11.984 --> 07:15.490
visited China. Beautiful area, and a very big 
industrial city. And it's where a lot of the

07:18.955 --> 07:25.585
refugees from Hong Kong came up into the Japanese 
coast. Not Hong Kong, but Canton. They came back

07:27.108 --> 07:29.331
and went in. and a key railroad center north and 
south. That railroad center is the line of

07:32.446 --> 07:39.795
communications that the Japanese were going to 
come right straight on down through into Hanoi. I

07:39.815 --> 07:45.682
mean, French Indochina, then split China north 
and south and separate the east and west. And the

07:46.723 --> 07:58.677
old man was, well, he needed air power to help, and 
we were going to supposedly, you know, again, hold

07:46.723 --> 07:58.677
off the Japanese Air Force, at least to keep them 
from giving air support to their troops. and

07:59.517 --> 08:03.262
bombing and strafing the Chinese troops. And 
again, it was going to turn out to be an air battle

08:03.342 --> 08:07.689
for the supremacy of the air before you could even 
do that. So we laid the plan on to sneak our

08:08.970 --> 08:18.184
aircraft, and I think there we took about 20 
aircraft. No. I think it's 12 aircraft. 12

08:22.590 --> 08:24.473
aircraft, 12 P-40. Again, Bob Neal and I would take 
the South Coast down. Okay, when was it?

08:34.448 --> 08:46.447
went to Quail Inn on the 11th of June.

08:46.467 --> 08:51.334
And how many planes went down there? Did you tell 
me? I think I told you it was twelve, and I believe

08:53.097 --> 08:56.142
that's true.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.709
The whole idea was

09:04.300 --> 09:11.049
Well, on his first fight, on the 12th of June, we had 
12 aircraft up in the air. The whole idea was to slip

09:11.710 --> 09:32.316
in there late in the evening, and again, come in low 
altitude late in the evening, and where the

09:11.710 --> 09:32.316
Japanese and their spies wouldn't know about it, 
and here again, be up in the air the next morning to

09:11.710 --> 09:32.316
catch the Japanese bombers, the training crews 
who were running daily training missions, in that

09:32.836 --> 09:40.605
area, Hualien, Heng Yang, Ling Ling area, bombing 
up and down a railroad track, you know, on training

09:32.836 --> 09:40.605
missions out of Hanoi. They were training a 
Japanese crew. And then we'd be ready to catch

09:42.828 --> 09:50.878
them, you know, and they'd be completely 
helpless, unsuspecting, surprising. That was

09:50.898 --> 09:51.598
the plan. So we took 12 airplanes down that evening 
and went to bed early and was ready the next morning

09:52.059 --> 10:01.290
on alert.

10:05.641 --> 10:17.018
It so happened that the Japanese learned our 
stuff, and they knew that we were down there, and

10:05.641 --> 10:17.018
they had their own plan that we later on found out 
very rapidly. Anyway, we took off that morning

10:17.038 --> 10:24.489
when, sure enough, here comes the flight, bombing 
flight, bombers coming from Manoa. So we took off,

10:24.529 --> 10:29.556
and I was leading the attack flight.

10:38.412 --> 11:06.242
I was leading a flight, I had a flight of three,

10:38.412 --> 11:06.242
no four, my staff was four, P-40Es at 15,000 feet, 
the attack flight, and up behind me at 18,000 feet

10:38.412 --> 11:06.242
was another four, and then at 20,000 feet was Bob 
Neal in reserve with four aircraft, so we had 12

10:38.412 --> 11:06.242
airplanes, and in my flight I had this the brand new 
E's with 6.50 caliber guns firing out the wing

11:07.066 --> 11:15.120
roots. What I mean today is just going to blast it 
out of the air. It is fantastic. 6.50's hitting

11:21.250 --> 11:26.239
something. So you were at 18,000 feet, right? And 
where were the bombers? And sure enough, here come

11:30.738 --> 11:35.366
the bombers in at about my level, 15,000 feet. But 
then you see we had Bob and the others up at 18,000

11:35.386 --> 11:41.135
feet, so we had some airplanes above us. But old 
Charlie Bond was in the attack flight, and that

11:42.037 --> 11:45.423
would be the same altitude. Well, I didn't see him 
at first, but my wingman, Joe Rosberg, We had a

11:50.806 --> 11:55.711
regular Air Force communication set. We could 
talk to each other for a change. Clearly hear each

11:57.753 --> 11:59.635
other. So he called me and told me, he said, right in 
front of each other, right in front of you. And sure

12:03.559 --> 12:06.282
enough, coming at an angle, we'd come about like 
this. And an angle, matter of fact, we'd call him

12:06.302 --> 12:09.886
just about like this. I forget what position it was 
with respect to the field at that time, but at any

12:11.968 --> 12:17.073
rate, I was closer here. So you were coming up from 
the left? Right, from the left rear. And about the

12:20.084 --> 12:24.069
same altitude, and I said, oh, I see him, I see him. 
And here we were, four ships in attack formation,

12:24.089 --> 12:28.594
so of course we told Bob Neal and all that. And 
that's all the airplanes I could see. I think there

12:30.877 --> 12:34.281
were four of them in formation. Four bombers. 
Yeah, four bombers in a B formation.

12:40.548 --> 12:41.169
Oh, five. Matter of fact, Joe Roberts flew up on my 
wing and fired his gun to get my attention and

12:41.429 --> 12:48.758
directed a fight of five Japanese bombers to my 
lower right. I had almost committed my formation

12:50.088 --> 12:55.474
to a jet formation at my left front, and I saw 
another one. So we knew there were two formations

12:55.494 --> 13:01.501
of aircraft. I chose this one. Which one's this 
one? This one is to the lower right. So because I'm

13:06.267 --> 13:10.031
in a better position, I had a little bit of altitude 
on him. And I figured that I could just ease down in

13:10.051 --> 13:14.897
position and just start on this left guy. and go 
right through those four and just shoot all four of

13:15.502 --> 13:19.487
them down just like that. Fully confident with 
this, these terrible firepower of 650. Well, I

13:24.833 --> 13:30.340
closed, started closing in and started firing, 
and I probably fired too far away. I had to be, it

13:30.460 --> 13:36.847
must have been at least a thousand yards, 50 
calories, and I figured I'd start closing in. And I

13:36.867 --> 13:40.952
knew they had rear gunners.

13:42.215 --> 13:45.759
And I started closing in, and I got closer and 
closer and closer. And I was close enough to see the

13:45.799 --> 13:54.230
rear

13:45.799 --> 13:54.230
gunner's bay down. It was a bay that hung down at the 
bottom of the gun sticking out. And I knew they were

13:57.594 --> 14:01.899
firing at me because I could see the smoke trailing 
from the gun. And then all of a sudden, I caught it in

14:01.919 --> 14:06.125
my vision. My yellow crystalline light warning 
came on. And I looked down. And then I looked a

14:10.902 --> 14:18.130
little closer, and smoke began to curl out from 
behind my dashboard, from my instrument board.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.072
And I said, oh, no, I've had it again. So I told Joe I 
was going to pull it off. So I pulled down because I

14:23.836 --> 14:26.379
knew I had trouble. I had an amazing dawn on me. I had 
to have been hit with a return fire. My press cone

14:29.742 --> 14:31.204
system had gone out. And about that time, I looked 
up. And again, you know, see where I was, bummers

14:35.843 --> 14:40.308
and all, and I saw these fighters, Japanese 
fighters. It must have been about 10 or 12, little

14:40.348 --> 14:43.372
I-97s. I saw them swarming down, coming down on us, 
you know. So this was their plan. They had

14:48.577 --> 14:58.949
suspected this, and they had to escort, fighter 
escort, come in a little bit later, and much higher

14:48.577 --> 14:58.949
than usual. I don't think Bob Neal at 20,000 feet 
ever saw the fighters, because nobody got on them.

15:03.594 --> 15:04.956
They came down immediately on me. And obviously, 
you know, press tone light on. Obviously, I was

15:08.596 --> 15:13.021
putting on steam out of my press tone system at the 
rear of my airplane. So, you know, you always go

15:13.041 --> 15:15.564
after the wounded guy. As I pulled off, two of these 
fighters came down and began to close on me. Well, I

15:20.149 --> 15:26.076
knew that, you know, eventually my engine was 
going to freeze up. So I said, well, I nursed as long

15:26.897 --> 15:28.840
as I can. So I was torn between the desire of pushing 
full throttle and a steep dive to get away from them

15:35.463 --> 15:37.485
I knew I could out-dive them, the little ones. They 
had a thermal blaster on about 320 miles an hour.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.311
And I could easily hit 450. But at the same time, I 
knew that the more I sped up my engine, the less time

15:43.873 --> 15:47.858
I was going to have it. And I made the prop throws. 
It'd be like putting a big plywood of 4x8 right out

15:50.181 --> 15:57.910
in front of me and slowing me down as I was beat for 
them. So I was torn between, so I kept it, I got up to

15:58.531 --> 16:07.781
about 375, just a little under 400, and sure enough 
began to pull away from it, but not before they put

15:58.531 --> 16:07.781
the bullet holes in my wing. And I saw the metal curl 
up in the wings and the bullets went through them,

16:08.101 --> 16:14.768
but I didn't catch on fire. And I, of course, I was 
crouched behind that fire, the armor plate, and I,

16:14.788 --> 16:26.701
you know, only about two months ago, I guess, was I 
shot down. Sure. So... I admit I was a little bit

16:28.045 --> 16:32.850
scared, and I was wondering if old Torrey Bond 
hadn't had it.

16:36.813 --> 16:40.497
But I kept looking, you know, I looked back at the 
time, and finally they pulled away. And I thought,

16:41.017 --> 16:43.059
well, at least they pulled off my danger. Then I 
began to look, and I knew I was near our field. I

16:45.982 --> 16:48.684
looked down the field way off to the right, but I 
could see it. I was still probably about six or

16:49.585 --> 16:52.488
eight thousand feet. And I saw a Japanese fighter 
straight from the field. I said, oh, I can't go in

16:57.526 --> 17:00.389
there. And I said, well, what do I do? What choice 
did you have? I said, well, I'm going to crash land

17:04.792 --> 17:08.316
this thing. I'm going to bail out. And about that 
time, the prop just stopped. The whole engine just

17:12.499 --> 17:16.343
froze, and the propeller stopped. Just, you know, 
burn up. The metal just queued. And of course, it

17:19.646 --> 17:21.948
meant it stopped. Well, then that's just like 
putting air brakes on. I began to slow up, and then I

17:24.910 --> 17:26.672
had to lower my nose. I was a glider from then on. And 
I forgot about, you know, when engine not running,

17:30.075 --> 17:34.421
I didn't have any hydraulic pressure. That 
operated my flaps with my little finger on the

17:34.441 --> 17:38.926
stick. Put my flaps down where I could, you know, 
come in slow for landing, but I forgot about this. I

17:43.312 --> 17:47.157
wouldn't have that capability to let my flaps 
down. But my engine did, and I picked out a field I

17:47.177 --> 17:55.848
was going to land in, rice paddy area, and left my 
gear up, and I was all prepared to land. And As I was

17:56.437 --> 18:06.085
coming in, getting ready to slow up, I hit my little 
finger on the wheel to put the flap down, but no

17:56.437 --> 18:06.085
flaps, and I just continued right on. And I saw I was 
going to overshoot. How fast were you going? Oh, it

18:09.829 --> 18:15.333
must have been 100, 105, something like that, 110. 
And I just continued at that speed. I didn't slow

18:16.855 --> 18:18.156
down any whatsoever. And you overshot your field? 
Oh, I knew I was going to overshoot. I knew what

18:21.679 --> 18:22.440
happened. I didn't have any flaps, so I couldn't 
slow down. If I remember correctly, you had to be

18:26.980 --> 18:31.969
around 100 at absolute max speed before you 
stalled. Did you light your gas on? Uh-huh. Was

18:35.736 --> 18:37.940
there any way to get rid of all your extra gas? Oh, I 
didn't have time to do anything like that. As a

18:41.827 --> 18:43.109
matter of fact, I didn't even think. All I thought 
about was landing airplanes. For some reason or

18:45.894 --> 18:47.778
other, I didn't want to bail out. I still don't know 
why. I just I guess it was having done it before. But

18:54.416 --> 18:57.919
thinking about it, all of a sudden I was too low to 
bail out. And here I'd overshot that field. So at

19:00.461 --> 19:06.906
the final moment, and at that very low speed, I took 
a chance and made almost a vertical bank. I

19:07.267 --> 19:10.489
couldn't have been over 50 feet from the ground. 
And pulled in tightly to hit in a rice paddy area

19:10.509 --> 19:19.397
immediately to my left. It's one I didn't install, 
but it didn't. But just as I rolled out flat, I hit

19:21.825 --> 19:26.569
the rice paddy area. And it so happened I hit, went 
in a little bit steeper than I thought, and I

19:26.589 --> 19:32.274
bounced. And thank God I bounced because I bounced 
up to the next, I was going up terrace, rice paddy

19:32.294 --> 19:39.521
areas. And I bounced up over about a three or four 
foot hard dike mud little dam Just tangent with the

19:47.609 --> 19:53.776
next layer, and came in on that, and then I caught 
into the mud and slime, of course. I stopped in

19:53.796 --> 19:56.219
about 50 feet. But had I gone on and landed where I 
first hit, I'd have hit that mud dike, and oh, I'd

19:56.239 --> 20:03.128
have killed myself. Just like we had another guy do 
that one time before. Mangelberg would be landed

20:07.653 --> 20:13.620
against one of them, and boy, it's like brick, like 
stone. But as I hit the cockpit, I had the canopy

20:18.862 --> 20:20.163
open. The canopy flew forward and kept all the mud 
and stuff off of me, but my head flew forward in the

20:20.443 --> 20:45.846
deceleration and caught my forehead on the gun 
sight and tore a little of my scalp open there, just

20:20.443 --> 20:45.846
scalp open, and didn't even, well, it stunned me a 
little bit, didn't knock me out, and when I clicked

20:20.443 --> 20:45.846
my senses, I immediately rolled the canopy open 
and unstrapped and got the hell out of the

20:20.443 --> 20:45.846
airplane. Here it might catch fire. and got out on 
the wing because there was mud around them. And the

20:51.669 --> 20:59.341
front end of the airplane, the propeller, the 
gearbox, and part of the motor had torn off. It was

20:59.361 --> 21:02.245
laying about 10 or 15 feet further up from the 
airplane. And the metal was just blue. It was

21:04.088 --> 21:10.297
burned up so that you could smell burnt metal and 
all. At any rate, they got out. And they didn't look

21:11.419 --> 21:13.041
around. Did you get away from the plane? I didn't 
want to get away from the airplane first because,

21:15.882 --> 21:21.549
you know, I'd step in mud up to my knees. And the 
first thing I was- What about blowing up or

21:21.569 --> 21:25.014
Japanese coming down? Well, I looked for straight 
from Japanese, and then I remember they left me at

21:25.074 --> 21:34.105
probably three or four thousand feet, so I may be 
harmed. So I wasn't too worried about that. But I

21:36.188 --> 21:42.396
looked around and saw all these Chinese peasants 
in the field with pitchforks and all, you know.

21:43.051 --> 21:46.535
digging at the rice, and I got to thinking about my 
other experience. I thought, well, am I going to go

21:46.555 --> 21:48.337
through the same thing again? These guys got 
pitchforks in their hands. So I didn't know what to

21:50.961 --> 22:06.780
do for a moment, but I just stood on a wingtip, and I, 
like you say, I was a little concerned about maybe

21:50.961 --> 22:06.780
the airplane would blow up, but then nothing 
happened, and as the seconds went by, I I'd

22:07.503 --> 22:09.506
forgotten about being alarmed about that. I just 
put on a wingtip. Then I began to do my telephone

22:10.728 --> 22:17.259
pattern mind with a couple of nearer guys, Chinese 
peasants. And the general wanted to have walked

22:17.399 --> 22:22.588
over, and I explained. And I believe I had, oh. Oh, 
did you ask them? I showed them the Chinese emblem

22:24.952 --> 22:29.720
on the wing of the airplane. So they knew I was no 
enemy. I, you know, gave this deal, telephone,

22:32.815 --> 22:58.435
telephone, you know, and they point over across to 
the rice paddy area to a little building, same sort

22:32.815 --> 22:58.435
of layout before, you know, a group of buildings, 
and I, well, I've got to walk through this mud after

22:32.815 --> 22:58.435
all, and I had another pair of boots on, so I decided 
to at least save a parachute, so I took my parachute

22:32.815 --> 22:58.435
out of the seat and my Form 1, and still had my helmet 
on, so I started walking through the mud, walked

22:59.039 --> 23:15.059
over this place, and came across another Chinese 
guy on the phone,

22:59.039 --> 23:15.059
and then he motioned for me to get the phone, and I 
got on the phone, and lo and behold, I heard English

22:59.039 --> 23:15.059
at the other end. No kidding. And it was a Catholic 
father missionary. that I have to go through here

23:19.407 --> 23:23.293
in the diary to get his name. But he told me who he 
was, and then I explained to him what the situation

23:23.313 --> 23:28.180
was. He told me, he said, well, one of the men there, 
and I'll talk to him later on, he put him back, but

23:28.281 --> 23:45.146
one of the men there will bring you to my house in Yen 
Phu, Y-E-N-P-H-U, just south of Wayland, about 20

23:28.281 --> 23:45.146
or 30 miles. That's where I knew where I was. But it 
so turned out I had to walk about ten miles to get to

23:46.610 --> 23:53.998
that place over a mountain ridge and across the 
river carrying that parachute. But after I got off

23:54.018 --> 23:57.302
I gave it back to Chinaman. He told Chinaman how to 
do this and all that. And then most of them would

23:59.704 --> 24:00.946
come. He didn't offer to carry a parachute or 
anything. So we started walking and we walked over

24:03.749 --> 24:11.377
a mountain ridge and stopped a little bit every now 
and then and got to this river. And they had a boat

24:11.437 --> 24:15.081
there that went across the river. maybe 300 feet 
wide, and walked a little bit further and came to a

24:16.327 --> 24:25.998
town, a little town, and walked me up to this 
missionary's home. And he immediately looked at

24:26.839 --> 24:36.009
my head, just bleeding a little, put his hands 
around me, and then the next thing I know, he had the

24:26.839 --> 24:36.009
mayor there, and I was a hero. Oh,

24:36.029 --> 24:39.774
really? And this goes into another story. Now, 
mind you, this was after being in combat and being

24:44.457 --> 24:48.283
shot down a second time, and actually I was a little 
shaken up. And then here all of a sudden, thrust

24:49.364 --> 25:09.373
into this group of civilians that wanted to 
welcome me with a function of being a hero, and give

24:49.364 --> 25:09.373
me a wine and dine me, and I'm wanting to get back, 
you know, to a base at Guilin, and I'm frustrated

24:49.364 --> 25:09.373
and confused and all, and hurting a little. But 
after maybe 30, 40 minutes, they did decide to take

25:14.208 --> 25:19.774
me to the railroad station. I guess they were 
waiting for a train that was on schedule. Put me on a

25:22.237 --> 25:23.979
train, take me up to Quail Inn. All these were on the 
railroad. But on the way up the train, they gave me

25:26.662 --> 25:30.426
what's called a firecracker parade for a hero. And 
I'm telling you, it was worse than combat. And I

25:34.871 --> 25:37.954
tell you, you know, all the time I fly, the 
weather's covered all. And they got oil on the

25:37.974 --> 25:40.256
bottom all the time. Well, you know, the Chinese 
invented firecrackers. And they're a great

25:43.925 --> 25:45.467
mentality. And as I was going down the city, the 
word got around. It was a small place, not near as

25:49.091 --> 25:54.398
big as Austin. And I'd say about like Bonham, 
something like that. But I'll bet there must have

25:57.361 --> 26:00.225
been 100,000 people around. And the word got out, 
and they lined up and down the main street on the way

26:00.245 --> 26:05.471
to the railroad station. And two Chinese soldiers 
would walk along in front of me, and they had these

26:05.491 --> 26:13.881
groups of firecrackers in those trains, little 
ones, fortunately. Lady hookers. You know,

26:15.424 --> 26:17.326
clusters of them. They'd throw them in the middle 
of the street, and they'd start busting, you know,

26:17.346 --> 26:23.432
and they'd fly loose, and the others would bust, 
you know. And I was this missionary, and a mayor was

26:23.452 --> 26:34.744
walking down that way, and I said, Walt, some of 
them, you know, would bust right under my leg and

26:23.452 --> 26:34.744
fly up my leg, between a couple of legs. And I had 
burnt places all over my legs the time I got to

26:34.764 --> 26:38.488
train. You know, you get blessed. You were a 
tippy-toe. But... You know, it was one of those

26:42.751 --> 26:44.874
things where you couldn't do anything about it. 
And when I got the train, they put me on. Well, what

26:48.739 --> 26:50.482
did the people think in that little city? This is 
probably the first time they've ever seen an

26:50.502 --> 26:53.085
apartment. Well, the best I could understand, you 
know, there's no doubt they were welcoming a hero

26:53.125 --> 27:02.598
and a missionary explained, you know, that he'd 
been here 20 years. He said, these people never

27:03.559 --> 27:05.923
seen anything like this. He said, I assure you that 
what y'all are doing here, you know, he gave me up.

27:10.055 --> 27:18.930
And that they all know it, and they appreciate it, 
and these people worship you, and you're God, and

27:10.055 --> 27:18.930
all. And we had been given a supplement that we were 
given. We stayed there about, well, I stayed there

27:22.176 --> 27:26.142
until I came home in August. They gave us parties 
and all. So you stayed there. Yeah. Okay, so you got

27:31.132 --> 27:32.753
back on the train. Yeah, and then that train took me 
on up to Quail Inn and stopped at Quail Inn. When I

27:36.797 --> 27:39.059
got off there, Bob Neal met me and took me out to pee. 
Only old man was there. Uh-huh. Question also.

27:42.442 --> 27:42.762
Yeah. When I got off, I had the bandage on my head, 
and he looked at me and said, Charlie? He said,

27:48.607 --> 27:51.249
what's happened to your luck? Or something. 
What's happened to your luck? You haven't been

27:53.191 --> 27:55.173
very lucky lately. He said, it's the second time 
they got you. And I said, yeah. And he said, well, I

27:58.976 --> 28:01.138
ate pee all night. I told him I was sorry I lost the 
airplane. I told him what happened. He said, don't

28:04.954 --> 28:05.855
worry about it. I said, we're glad you're back. You 
know, words like that. Of course, he was in the

28:10.960 --> 28:14.764
middle of playing another campaign, and that's 
the reason he was there. So, after a few more

28:14.804 --> 28:22.953
minutes, he took me to the hospital, and then we 
just was critiquing the fight. Well, of course,

28:22.973 --> 28:27.258
they'd already critiqued it, but Bob Neal began to 
critique me on it. And what happened in the fight?

28:28.499 --> 28:31.362
The Japanese, like I say, earlier, had told you, 
you know, they... knew we were coming, that would

28:31.915 --> 28:34.258
be there, and they expected me. They had their 
surprise. Well, it so happened the flight I

28:35.901 --> 28:41.568
attacked was the bombers, and it was the bait. The 
bait for all of us. And I attacked it, and then the

28:44.653 --> 28:48.138
fighters came down on us. But the other flight was 
in the formation of the bomber flight. I think it

28:53.185 --> 28:54.847
was six of those. I didn't prepare it with that. Or 
five or six. But these weren't bombers. They were

28:58.212 --> 28:59.474
in a bomber formation. And when Bob Neal... No, a 
George Burgard flight attacked them, and Bob Neal

29:00.974 --> 29:07.000
eventually joined in with them. They pulled up 
into Immelman's twin-engine aircraft and turned

29:07.380 --> 29:17.370
back and, you know, were practically on the tail of 
the P-40 when you knew what was going on. It so

29:17.390 --> 29:23.537
happened this was the brand-new, I think it was 
called an I-97, twin-engine fighter that the

29:17.390 --> 29:23.537
Japanese built. It was the first time we ever saw 
it. These were fighters, and they had

29:25.419 --> 29:28.922
20-millimeter guns in them. Were they fast? Oh, 
yeah. Well, they were comparable to a P-40.

29:35.328 --> 29:38.853
Actually, not as maneuverable as a P-40 because 
they're bigger and twin-engine. And actually,

29:38.873 --> 29:40.755
they had a rear gunner on it. It wasn't a real 
fighter per se. Sort of a combo. Yeah. More of an

29:45.421 --> 29:46.822
attack airplane. At any rate, very maneuverable. 
But not as maneuverable as a Zero. And after George

29:52.589 --> 29:58.977
Burgoyne and his flight, the boys would gain the 
sense that they knew then that they were up against

29:52.589 --> 29:58.977
fighters. I think they shot one of them down, and 
later on we, well, as a matter of fact, the Chinese

29:59.328 --> 30:15.512
recovered the crew where the thing belly landed 
and captured the gunner, and we brought the gunner

29:59.328 --> 30:15.512
back to our air base where we actually had a chance 
to talk with him to an interpreter. He was scared to

30:15.592 --> 30:16.534
death. He was scared? He was scared to death. And he 
wanted to know where the bar power for the Tiger

30:18.997 --> 30:26.128
came from, so we showed him the gun. Oh, really? He 
showed the Japanese prisoner the guns? Yeah. What

30:30.899 --> 30:32.602
did he think of that? Oh, well, he was impressed. To 
the interpreter, that was the only question he

30:34.686 --> 30:36.789
asked. Where is all your firepower from the Flying 
Tiger airplane? We showed it to him. And then we

30:42.819 --> 30:46.265
wanted to take him up to the cave. We had our 
operations officer in a cave in one of these big

30:46.345 --> 30:52.656
mountains.

30:53.193 --> 31:00.960
The interpreter told the Chinese army guys to 
bring him up to a cave in North Ferry. He looked up at

31:00.981 --> 31:02.322
the cave. He thought he had it then. He didn't want 
to go. He was scared to death. They thought, sure,

31:06.226 --> 31:08.588
he was going to take him up there and kill him. But 
finally, he went. Of course, he had to go. And we

31:11.851 --> 31:15.334
took him up there, and the Italian people grilled 
him then. But this is one way we learned about their

31:15.635 --> 31:22.221
plan, from him telling

31:15.635 --> 31:22.221
us. And what did they do with this Japanese 
prisoner? I don't know. They took him off later on.

31:26.564 --> 31:27.765
I'm sure they gave him to war. I'm sure they did. The 
Chinese had no mercy with Japanese prisoners. And

31:36.178 --> 31:39.923
then I had that to recuperate. And then I was back 
flying, though, in another few days. That was just

31:44.650 --> 31:46.112
a hickey on my head. Sure. I think I was off about 
four or five days. And then, sure enough, we began

31:49.780 --> 31:56.226
to get in a lot of aerial dogfights from the Handcow 
area. And the United States Air Force, about that

31:56.827 --> 32:03.994
time, Army Air Corps, brought in a squadron of 
B-25s, bombers. First time we ever had any

32:04.014 --> 32:05.015
bombers. We went and escorted them. And then we 
started that phase of operations, trying to

32:08.238 --> 32:13.003
escort the B-25s. A brand new outfit that had no 
combat experience at all. And that was quite an

32:17.264 --> 32:19.827
experience. It was quite disheartening at first. 
They were green guys, and they couldn't even find

32:23.490 --> 32:26.533
their targets. But it basically turned out to be a 
very capable outfit. Now, these were part of the

32:30.217 --> 32:32.219
Army Air Corps. That's right, the Americans. 
Okay, so these were the Americans in there, and

32:33.821 --> 32:40.167
they were just working with the Flying Tigers. We 
were an escort. And who was the general in charge?

32:44.939 --> 32:46.701
Well, they were C under Chenault. At that time, 
Chenault had already been inducted back into the

32:46.721 --> 32:50.787
Air Force. And for all practical purposes, the 
14th Air Force was organized on paper anyhow. And

32:58.216 --> 33:00.639
this outfit was signed to him. He was a brigadier 
general in the Army Air Corps at that time. Okay,

33:03.884 --> 33:10.472
and so the Flying Tiger pilots, though, they were 
still civilian. Oh, yeah. And the bomber pilots

33:11.714 --> 33:13.957
were Army Air Corps. That's right. And we knew at 
that time, by that time, that some, probably July

33:15.331 --> 33:20.676
the 4th. Summer of 42 then. Summer of 42. And we knew 
by then that around July the 4th of thereabouts, we

33:23.139 --> 33:32.988
figured in a minute's time that we would be 
disbanded.

33:33.008 --> 33:43.178
And it was during that time at Quail Inn where all of 
us were interviewed by a team from the United

33:33.008 --> 33:43.178
States Army Air Corps with the idea of, trying to 
get us to stay and inducting us as lieutenants and

33:43.867 --> 33:47.593
so forth. Oh, okay. So then sometime after Chong 
King, then you were interviewed to be given...

33:49.496 --> 33:58.550
Well, at Guilin I was interviewed, yes. To be 
given. And tell me about that. Was the idea here to

34:00.653 --> 34:07.023
interview you, try to get you to stay there, and 
give you an act of commission? What General

34:07.965 --> 34:10.228
Arnold's... half-Arnold's objective was. Was he 
there? No, no. Oh, General Arnold had paid visits

34:14.906 --> 34:17.310
to China. I never did see him. Okay. But it was 
always good. On his subordinates. Oh, yeah. Oh,

34:21.476 --> 34:21.776
yeah. As a matter of fact, old Tex Randall, a 
brigadier general, I don't know where he is today,

34:21.796 --> 34:34.175
he was the general in charge of about four or five 
men. Interviewing each one of us, particularly

34:34.395 --> 34:40.384
the pilots, talked to the airmen in mass, but 
interviewing each one of the pilots individually

34:40.583 --> 35:07.401
for the idea of contrapposition the idea of trying 
to talk us into staying over and he took the wrong

34:40.583 --> 35:07.401
attitude rather you know forgetting he wasn't 
talking to military men he was talking to people

34:40.583 --> 35:07.401
that had he had no authority over at all and he 
irritated every one of us and pretty soon for

34:40.583 --> 35:07.401
example tell me tell me about your interview with 
uh well uh i had met him before see i knew him and he

34:40.583 --> 35:07.401
knew me and of course uh when I was called in, in the 
cave, by the way, in Operation, sitting in our very

35:07.870 --> 35:13.257
pleasant place. He said, well, Troy, I ain't no 
doubt about you. We know you. He said, ain't no

35:16.822 --> 35:17.463
doubt. You're going to go back to your old air-con 
steer, aren't you? And I said, well, I don't know. I

35:22.350 --> 35:24.012
said, you know, something like this. What do I get? 
I said, you know, Tex, all I want is a regular

35:25.213 --> 35:28.197
commission. He said, you give me a regular 
commission and I'll stay here right now. Well, I

35:32.603 --> 35:35.007
just can't do that, Troy. And I said, well, I... 
know, I've been over here a while. I'd go back home

35:39.528 --> 35:43.532
and fly with maybe TWA." He said, well, and this is 
what irritated me and sort of insulted me. You

35:47.996 --> 35:50.459
know, all the stuff I'd been through with combat. 
He said, well, you know, they put you on a ship and

35:51.099 --> 35:57.705
send you back, so there ain't no doubt probably one 
of those submarines sank you and you get lost at

35:51.099 --> 35:57.705
sea. And I thought, that's really irritating. 
Sure. He was trying to scare me, you know. Well, in

36:04.312 --> 36:05.653
fact, I said that I think I said, that almost does 
it. I said, I'm not worried about that. And he

36:11.720 --> 36:17.106
definitely... Irritated at all? Most of them, 
yeah. And a lot of the boys, had he talked me into

36:18.127 --> 36:30.642
staying, I had enough influence and prestige in 
the outfit by then that I'm sure a lot of the guys who

36:18.127 --> 36:30.642
stayed with me, I could have talked them into doing 
it. But once I got fed up with it, he practically

36:30.662 --> 36:35.067
lost the whole outfit. Oh, what would they have 
done? Four or five stayed open. What would they

36:37.815 --> 36:40.799
have done for you? Well, the ones that stayed, I 
think Tex Hill, he was corner commander, I think he

36:40.819 --> 36:46.967
was given a majority. And I think he would have 
given me a majority. A majority, what does that

36:49.790 --> 36:50.892
mean? Major. Oh, okay, so they would have made you a 
major with a reserve commission. Right, right.

36:57.100 --> 37:01.445
Probably has to go out first or second, just like it 
did actually when I did go back there. Then the

37:01.465 --> 37:04.429
captain, then I'm first, then captain, then 
major. I think four or five pilots stayed over. Tex

37:07.225 --> 37:09.448
Hill was one of them. But by far, the majority of us 
went home. By far, almost 98% of the airmen went

37:12.932 --> 37:19.179
home. We were all tired. And again, that just shows 
you the importance of an individual sent on a

37:21.262 --> 37:28.571
mission to do a job. He completely watched it. He 
didn't take the right approach to it. I don't think

37:33.367 --> 37:35.669
he understood who he was talking to. He just forgot 
who he was talking to. You know, all of us were

37:37.371 --> 37:47.802
ex-military people, and I think he figured, well, 
in other words, he just took the attitude, we've

37:37.371 --> 37:47.802
had it, and we're going to be in the military 
whether you like it or not. Well, we do. We were told

37:49.204 --> 37:51.526
by Chenault, all of you do what you want to do. 
You've been faithful to me. I'm not putting

37:52.628 --> 37:54.650
pressure on you to do anything. You want to stay? 
Fine. I need you. I can use you. You know that. But if

37:59.355 --> 38:01.517
you want to go home, I won't hold it against you. He 
looked me in the face and didn't tell me anything.

38:04.417 --> 38:05.738
So I didn't have any pressure from him. He was fair 
and square with me. And I remember telling him

38:08.040 --> 38:10.622
goodbye at Chongqing. He hated seeing me go. They 
had tears in their eyes. I went. I saw the men tell

38:15.987 --> 38:21.272
him goodbye and cry like babies.

38:22.232 --> 38:23.694
But that was subsequent. We still had, you know, 
all during the interviews, we still had fighting

38:23.894 --> 38:27.897
to do. And during it, that last few weeks, Johnny 
Allison, who later became a major general in the

38:31.737 --> 38:56.959
Air Force, brought in the 23rd Pursuit Group of the 
United States Army Air Corps, and I flew with him

38:31.737 --> 38:56.959
and a squadron of regular Air Force guys during the 
last week or two I was there. I really was proud of

38:57.440 --> 38:59.261
it. Gee, I was tickled to death to see him. and 
gung-ho boys know where to go they were green and

39:01.268 --> 39:30.010
they knew it but uh johnny allison his final 
fighter party as he was just as uh well he acted as

39:01.268 --> 39:30.010
though you know i was the authority and boss and 
probably that boy had a thousand more hours in

39:01.268 --> 39:30.010
fighter airplane landia but uh when we sat at night 
and talked for hours you know passing on tactics

39:01.268 --> 39:30.010
and all and they uh They took over smoothly and did 
all

39:30.462 --> 39:37.989
right. The rest of the time was, comparatively 
speaking, uneventful in the latter part of June,

39:38.009 --> 39:44.916
July. Oh, 4th of July, well, latter part of June, I 
got another hassle. I had to scramble some

39:52.223 --> 39:59.490
airplanes at Heng Yang just up the river and up the 
railroad north Quay-Lynn, a Han-Cow raid of

39:59.757 --> 40:04.164
Zeros. We met Zeros during those days. They had 
brought the Japanese Navy pilots with Zeros, far

40:06.488 --> 40:12.898
superior to the Japanese Army. They were 
determined to wipe us out and announced on the

40:12.918 --> 40:20.870
radio every evening that they were determined 
that they were going to eliminate the ABG. And they

40:20.890 --> 40:26.980
started hitting us from the south at Cancun, White 
Cloud Airport, and also from the north at Han-Cow.

40:27.533 --> 40:35.284
And it was dip and tuck for a while, but we managed to 
shoot the Zeros down just as well as the others. Did

40:35.304 --> 40:37.727
you have any victories against the Zeros? No, I 
never shot a Zero down. The last combat, the last

40:40.832 --> 40:50.826
Japanese I saw, this was about, I guess, a week or 
ten days before I left China to come home. I had to,

40:50.846 --> 40:57.135
we were up at Heng Yang, and I had a raid coming from 
Pan Cal, and I wasn't on alert. I wasn't a skater,

40:57.402 --> 40:59.344
but I was out there. And the guys took off, and there 
was that old recce airplane sitting out there,

40:59.985 --> 41:06.513
P-40, but it was in good shape. The only thing, it 
didn't have guns in it. It had a camper in it. So I

41:09.676 --> 41:11.539
thought, well, I'm not going to leave that 
airplane. It's great. So I went out on my own, got in

41:12.079 --> 41:15.023
that airplane, and took off. And, you know, time 
was about 20,000 feet. It had guns on it, so we could

41:19.448 --> 41:22.752
do a little bit better and hit it out. So I went 
20,000 feet. And I just flying around, you know,

41:24.419 --> 41:29.106
trying to stay out of the way, because I didn't have 
any guns. Looked across, saw an airplane coming

41:29.126 --> 41:34.173
toward me, and I didn't know what it was, first of 
all. And as we got abreast of each other, it was

41:34.854 --> 41:39.200
obviously zero. That's the first zero I'd seen 
come. And it was up there with you? Yeah, and here I

41:43.426 --> 41:49.735
was in an unarmed airplane, and obviously he was up 
there shooting. So we both started turning, you

41:50.120 --> 41:53.825
know, me doing recognize each other, you know, 
come around. And I knew in no time, oh, he'd be on my

41:53.885 --> 41:56.949
tail, so I just did a split ass. And started 
straight down with full throttle, but I knew I

41:57.850 --> 42:01.875
could dive away from him. And I, around 10, 12,000 
feet, I hit a clouded area, so I came to the clouds. I

42:06.101 --> 42:07.542
knew it was all right then. I knew he wasn't far. And 
I'd been up there quite a while, and all of a sudden,

42:09.725 --> 42:15.773
a red light turned on. fuel light turned on in the 
airplane, indicating, you know, fuel, no fuel. I

42:20.928 --> 42:32.044
had forgotten for the moment, because I wasn't 
even shaken up or caught without ammo, without

42:20.928 --> 42:32.044
guns or anything. And I figured, well, third time, 
let's charm. So I had forgotten about the red

42:35.970 --> 42:40.296
warning light on the fuel system. It still gives 
you about 20 minutes. I figured I was low on fuel,

42:42.119 --> 42:44.983
and I figured they didn't die any second. So I aimed 
at Ling Ling Field. I still had enough altitude to

42:47.170 --> 42:52.758
get to Ling Ling Field, just south of Hanyang, even 
by gliding in. But I played my approach and all, and

42:52.778 --> 42:58.206
by the time I touched down, I still had power. And 
then when I got to the field, I talked to a mechanic,

42:58.726 --> 43:06.617
and it dawned on me that I still had probably 12 
minutes of fuel in the airplane. At least got the

43:06.637 --> 43:07.879
airplane down. They didn't strike it. So that was, 
I guess, the last

43:17.178 --> 43:19.260
I guess it was the last combat mission I was really 
on. Oh, I was on some scramble missions later on

43:19.700 --> 43:24.145
during the day that I didn't engage. I didn't see 
any Japanese. And so when was that one? This was

43:28.749 --> 43:34.095
July the 3rd. July the 3rd. You know,

43:36.677 --> 43:42.443
and... Oh, wait, there's the old man singing too. 
175 hours and 40 minutes I flew in combat. Total

43:48.920 --> 43:51.302
time, 175. 14th of July. 14th of July, what? I left, 
actually,

43:54.145 --> 44:05.214
the 14th of July, I took off from China on the way 
home. Went back to Chongqing and India. And how'd

44:11.119 --> 44:13.241
you go home? Well, that's another story. Were you 
sorry about leaving China, or what were your

44:15.987 --> 44:19.250
feelings? No, I was tired, combat-weary.

44:24.615 --> 44:28.599
I was very, I was, I guess I was hurt by Tech Sanders' 
attitude. And I couldn't get out of my mind,

44:29.980 --> 44:36.286
General Burr had come, and only Congress can do 
that. And I thought, I had made up my mind that I was

44:37.527 --> 44:45.555
going to go home and see, personally, And I did. I 
was going to ask General Hap Arnold for a regular

44:48.863 --> 44:51.967
commission. I wasn't going to give up. And that 
was, I made up my mind to do that. And after Tech

44:56.712 --> 45:04.180
Sanders treated me the way he did, and the old man, I 
told the old man what I was going to do, and he said he

44:56.712 --> 45:04.180
didn't blame me. And well, the story to get home, 
OK. We were leaving, told the old man goodbye. It

45:12.289 --> 45:15.492
was a very emotional deal. His chief of staff, Skip 
Adair, asked to pull Bob Neal and I off the side. We

45:23.596 --> 45:27.480
were practically the guys that ran the Flying 
Tigers in under Chenault. Bob Neal was really the

45:27.841 --> 45:33.207
commander, if you will, and I was the operations 
officer. In other words, the old man's right-hand

45:33.227 --> 45:37.711
man. By that time, I was a squadron commander, 
getting a squadron commander for $750. And I was

45:44.648 --> 46:02.666
one of, I think, 16 pilots that volunteered to stay 
over an extra 10 days after July the 4th, because at

45:44.648 --> 46:02.666
the old man's request, his plea, that we were right 
in the middle of this Hancock campaign and he

45:44.648 --> 46:02.666
needed us. And the 23rd Pursuit Group with Johnny 
Allison hadn't come in on schedule. So I stayed

46:09.273 --> 46:13.677
another, that's the reason I didn't leave until 
the 14th. 14th of July. 14th of July, 1942. Skip

46:19.585 --> 46:28.813
Adair pulled Bob Nail and I offside and said, would 
you two guys mind, see if you can't take care of Red

46:19.585 --> 46:28.813
Petac? She was one of the two nurses we had. 
Terrific gal. She married, what was his first

46:32.576 --> 46:38.481
name? Petac, P-E-T-A-C-H. A real fine guy. He was 
one of the other squadrons. They fell in love with

46:43.070 --> 46:56.286
each other over there, and they married towards, 
I'd say, well,

46:43.070 --> 46:56.286
maybe the early summer.
