00:12.788 --> 00:14.630
This is August 7, 1987. I'm Bob Cornish, and I'm 
interviewing Wolfgang Roessler in his office at

00:15.371 --> 00:27.183
Texas A&M Department of Urban and Regional 
Planning. I'd like to begin, Wolf, by asking you

00:27.443 --> 00:39.336
about your studies in planning, where you did your 
work in academia. and your degrees, and then how

00:40.075 --> 00:43.600
you came to be in the United States. By airplane. 
Thanks.

00:52.714 --> 01:06.775
Well,

00:52.714 --> 01:06.775
I earned my doctorate at the University of Hesse, 
Marburg, in economics and sociology with an

00:52.714 --> 01:06.775
emphasis on urban planning. notably 
transportation planning. In fact, my

01:09.486 --> 01:30.017
dissertation was one of the first computer 
modeling attempts of that period and had to do with

01:09.486 --> 01:30.017
measuring the cost effectiveness of commuting 
versus resettlement. That was the era when there

01:30.498 --> 01:34.264
were large numbers of homeless people all over 
Europe, all over Western Europe, millions of

01:35.881 --> 01:41.289
them. There was a very current issue. What do you do 
with these people? They mostly lived

01:45.736 --> 02:03.643
helter-skelter, and wherever there was some 
quarters, there were camps thrown up overnight by

01:45.736 --> 02:03.643
the various government and military, government 
forces, and people lived in little towns, and they

02:04.332 --> 02:09.758
If I work in nearby communities, it was just a 
survival kind of thing. What year was that? That

02:11.439 --> 02:15.804
was the whole period from 1946 to 1948.

02:17.966 --> 02:33.883
And during that period, this quite 
coincidentally, I became interested in that

02:17.966 --> 02:33.883
issue of resettlement versus leaving people 
where they are and strengthening commuting

02:17.966 --> 02:33.883
facilities.

02:34.842 --> 02:38.928
a number of applied research projects I was 
involved in. So that's how all this fitted

02:38.948 --> 02:40.971
together. And then I did receive a scholarship 
from the University of Wisconsin through the U.S.

02:41.572 --> 03:00.919
military government in the state of Hessen and 
Professor Howard Becker, who is a noted

02:41.572 --> 03:00.919
sociologist, period. So I went to Madison, 
Wisconsin, on that, and that's where I met Walter

03:03.142 --> 03:09.128
Blucher on a trip to Chicago. And Walter Blucher 
said, why don't you stay here? You could make a

03:12.311 --> 03:19.618
contribution, particularly with the skills that 
you have in computer applications to

03:12.311 --> 03:19.618
transportation. Why should you do that? And one 
thing led to another. There were, at that time, two

03:22.741 --> 03:25.284
jobs open in the United States. One was in 
Louisville, Kentucky, and the other one in Kansas

03:25.404 --> 03:28.427
City. I like Kansas City, and so I went there. And my 
assignment, first assignment was to develop a

03:31.964 --> 03:49.890
comprehensive analysis of future travel demand 
patterns that was to become the basis of the urban

03:31.964 --> 03:49.890
freeway system for Kansas City. And then, of 
course, leading to all the other related

03:50.411 --> 03:58.022
considerations of economic and social policy and 
land use planning policy at the local level and

03:58.610 --> 04:03.956
whatnot. And

04:05.037 --> 04:19.973
before I knew it, I was an active member in the old 
American Institute of Planners. And that was a

04:21.274 --> 04:24.097
very pleasant experience. It was a very small 
congenial group of highly competent people. in

04:28.428 --> 04:33.655
contrast to what the mass organizations later 
deteriorated into. Anyway, it was a very pleasant

04:34.676 --> 04:47.432
experience, and it helped me shape my own career 
objectives. When did you become associated with

04:47.512 --> 04:50.817
Ladislas Segal? Oh, that was much later. Much 
later. After the first Kansas City tour, I became

04:52.899 --> 04:57.405
planning director in Palm Springs. And that was a 
very interesting experience. What year was that?

05:01.387 --> 05:02.549
That was 53. And then I went with Segal in 58. And

05:07.175 --> 05:19.994
in between I had done another study for Kansas City 
that there was a huge annexation north of the

05:07.175 --> 05:19.994
Missouri River and in Jackson County. And then 
eventually went with him. I met him along the way at

05:24.380 --> 05:27.645
meetings. through some committee work in the AIP.

05:33.069 --> 05:36.533
So one day he offered me a job and I joined his firm. 
And then you moved to Cincinnati. I moved to

05:39.175 --> 05:42.679
Cincinnati.

05:42.699 --> 05:44.501
From Palm Springs. And that was actually

05:44.521 --> 05:56.113
professionally the experience that led me into 
the consulting business for the rest of my career.

06:02.392 --> 06:04.836
And we worked all over the place. And of course, he 
was very much avant-garde in the plumbing

06:04.856 --> 06:10.082
profession. We had a lot of common interests. And 
it was easy for us to work together. And so I did

06:16.190 --> 06:24.261
dozens of master plans on a lot of interesting 
studies in San Francisco and Seattle. around

06:24.697 --> 06:31.024
Washington, D.C., in

06:24.697 --> 06:31.024
specialized areas. Like, for instance, this 
building envelope business that we were, again,

06:31.064 --> 06:42.056
applying in the San Antonio River works that came 
out of that period. Segal taught me how to do that in

06:42.617 --> 06:52.008
connection with the project in Seattle, and then 
another one in Cincinnati, sort of his thing. It

06:52.028 --> 06:54.130
had to be done very painstakingly. He was not, 
anyhow, a typical planner in the sense that the

06:54.700 --> 07:06.150
majority of the people in the profession defined 
themselves in practice. He was always

07:06.170 --> 07:14.197
determined to solve problems. And he said, 
somebody comes to you, and he says, I want to

07:15.158 --> 07:18.481
comprehend the plan. But mostly, that's really 
nonsense. They really don't know what they want.

07:21.504 --> 07:23.205
But somewhere, there is a problem. And then it's 
your opportunity, when you identify this, to

07:23.759 --> 07:30.047
teach them how to relate all of these different 
aspects to each other. And that then makes it truly

07:30.107 --> 07:40.641
comprehensive rather than going through a ritual 
of five or six steps that so typically show up in all

07:30.107 --> 07:40.641
these planning reports. Well, I could relate to 
that. And so I think we're a very successful team.

07:49.913 --> 07:51.555
However, for some reason,

07:54.286 --> 08:02.379
Nazi Sieger wasn't interested in getting into the 
major transportation studies of that period, and

07:54.286 --> 08:02.379
I was interested in that at the time. So when Ruben 
Bergendorff asked

08:03.181 --> 08:16.904
if I would join their company as a planning 
director... For the transcriber, how do you spell

08:03.181 --> 08:16.904
Bergendorff? B-E-R-G-E-N-D-O-F-F. It's a 
Swedish name. I took over that whole business, and

08:21.539 --> 08:30.934
I did consider a number of huge transportation 
studies. I had, at times, 150 people working for me

08:31.094 --> 08:40.649
all over the world, literally, in this country, in 
Australia, and you know, wherever you are. So,

08:40.669 --> 08:49.403
that was fine, but somewhere along the way, I had 
hoped to spent the last several years of my career

08:51.357 --> 08:58.384
productively in an academic environment. And I 
had several offers and didn't really do much about

08:58.404 --> 09:02.367
it. And eventually, Jack Williams, who was 
president of Texas A&M at the time, offered me this

09:02.407 --> 09:12.957
position here as head of this department. I wasn't 
too interested in this because I told him I didn't

09:13.278 --> 09:19.103
really care to have more administrative 
responsibilities, but as it turned out, I spent

09:20.332 --> 09:32.092
two-thirds of my time at A&M with administrative 
details, which hopefully will come to an end

09:20.332 --> 09:32.092
sooner or later. So I came here. Why did Jack 
Williams want you to come to A&M? Jack Williams was

09:36.599 --> 09:38.102
dismayed. He said he wasn't... he had lots of 
problems with the College of Architecture, and he

09:38.282 --> 09:45.394
didn't feel that the Department of Urban and 
Regional Planning, as it was called, really had

09:45.863 --> 09:56.600
the strengths that he thought it should have, and 
it didn't perform to his satisfaction. There had

09:57.522 --> 10:05.395
been apparently a lot of unpleasant experiences 
with faculty and administrators and whatever.

10:05.435 --> 10:11.685
It's not worth even remembering, but it was a 
situation that had given the department and the

10:12.121 --> 10:36.576
college had, in part two, a reputation of being 
odd, being not worth it, dealing with things that

10:12.121 --> 10:36.576
they shouldn't be concerned with, having more 
individual members, more concerned with

10:12.121 --> 10:36.576
headline hunting and politics and teaching, 
producing quality education, at least in the

10:12.121 --> 10:36.576
views of the

10:38.935 --> 11:07.896
Since he knew my general attitude and what I 
thought of what I might do with planning

10:38.935 --> 11:07.896
education, and it has to have a meaningful linkage 
to reality and so on, and has to produce people who

10:38.935 --> 11:07.896
can, in fact, perform effectively immediately 
upon completion of their academic work, He said, I

11:08.922 --> 11:09.964
should try that. We'll give that department one 
more chance. If you can do something with it, then

11:12.507 --> 11:16.773
everybody will be happy. If not, no harm done. I 
came in 1975,

11:19.598 --> 11:25.767
that summer. So Virgil had been interim 
department head for the spring and the summer.

11:29.753 --> 11:31.215
Virgil was the interim department head. And

11:31.255 --> 11:38.305
what I found was preposterous.

11:40.478 --> 11:46.488
financial administrative mess, that they were 
defunding totally inadequate. And the first

11:47.349 --> 11:59.649
thing I did is I had a meeting with the then vice 
president for academic affairs, John Calhoun,

11:47.349 --> 11:59.649
and told him that, and asked him one role, dean of 
faculties. And I said, I spent more money in my

11:59.669 --> 12:05.719
little plumbing firm in one week than I did here to 
spend the whole year. And it's ridiculous. They

12:08.069 --> 12:19.844
agreed, and they asked Dean Reed why it was, and he 
had no meaningful answer except that he didn't

12:08.069 --> 12:19.844
really care, I think. However, through 
intervention by the vice president, that was

12:20.104 --> 12:37.907
corrected for the academic year that was about to 
get underway, and so at least I had some funds for

12:20.104 --> 12:37.907
running of the office. and supporting 
financially some of the graduate students

12:38.208 --> 12:44.538
through assistance shows. And that helped the 
morale considerably. The students were

12:50.947 --> 12:52.990
marvelous. They were extremely supportive. I met 
with them. I told them what I had in mind and that

12:56.976 --> 13:01.623
some things had to be changed. There had to be a 
basis established, a discipline, operation. and

13:07.047 --> 13:35.147
we had to operate just like we operate in a public or 
private planning office and not impossible way

13:07.047 --> 13:35.147
that things were running in all directions and 
there was no objective no goal or any such thing and

13:07.047 --> 13:35.147
much to my surprise three members of the faculty 
were very opposed to any such change but with the

13:07.047 --> 13:35.147
help of the students we accomplished it anyway and 
uh I don't think I want to get into that. And it was

13:37.823 --> 13:41.207
pathetic, really pathetic. They all eventually 
joined

13:41.287 --> 13:51.219
the more productive part of the faculty.

13:52.160 --> 14:00.190
And gradually, we managed to establish something 
that resembled a professional unit. It was also

14:01.300 --> 14:09.410
clear to me in 1975 that the traditional planning 
program was passé and no longer served a useful

14:01.300 --> 14:09.410
purpose. There was hardly anybody who would 
employ people who knew nothing about how to make

14:09.430 --> 14:16.159
land use surveys and they had to learn something 
better than that. And so we instituted the

14:16.940 --> 14:22.347
emphasis areas in planning. which other schools 
had done successfully, and that helped us

14:22.613 --> 14:31.206
strengthen our position. We also did another 
thing. We decided that all laboratories would

14:33.650 --> 14:48.894
have to be sponsored by some outside agency so that 
faculty and students had the opportunity to

14:33.650 --> 14:48.894
practice their trade and remain up-to-date. 
However, I felt that we had to add some other

14:52.448 --> 14:59.336
programs to the department. There was some 
discussion about an undergraduate program, but

14:59.996 --> 15:12.810
the university administration was adverse to 
that, and I could get very little support for any

14:59.996 --> 15:12.810
kind of undergraduate program. But when I raised 
the question of a PhD, I was immediately given a

15:12.830 --> 15:18.777
great deal of support Vice President's office, 
and they said, yes, that's the kind of thing we want

15:19.702 --> 15:25.849
in academic orientation. And there was a doctoral 
program called the Doctor of Environmental

15:26.890 --> 15:36.802
Design, which is a low-grade professional 
program. And I thought that that should be

15:37.763 --> 15:42.749
discontinued. And the faculty agreed with that. 
And so we simply changed the requirements for that

15:45.072 --> 15:49.557
degree to the PhD requirements in the traditional 
sense, and eventually asked the administration

15:49.958 --> 16:06.303
and the state board, the Texas College and 
University Board, to change the title to PhD in

15:49.958 --> 16:06.303
Urban Regional Science. That has helped us 
tremendously, and we were able to build, over the

16:06.864 --> 16:18.261
years, a fairly effective doctoral program on a 
tutorial basis. The products of that program had

16:18.865 --> 16:28.916
by now reached substantial, significant 
positions in academia and industry and

16:18.865 --> 16:28.916
government, and so they proved a point. That was 
the first Ph.D. in the college. It was the first

16:31.959 --> 16:36.484
Ph.D. in the college, and it was logical. It had a 
broad enough basis.

16:46.017 --> 17:04.757
procedures that

16:46.017 --> 17:04.757
had originally been initiated by the University 
of Wisconsin by Ratcliffe in his program on land

16:46.017 --> 17:04.757
economics, and later expanded substantially 
into what is now called regional science. So we

17:06.378 --> 17:09.261
used that, but we added another dimension. Since 
the regional science and land economic programs

17:13.625 --> 17:16.428
highly quantitative, almost entirely 
quantitative. We felt we needed another

17:16.768 --> 17:18.490
dimension. We simply called it urban science, 
which is broad and doesn't commit us to anything.

17:25.738 --> 17:29.101
So the degree can go into either direction. And it 
has done this very well. We've had some

17:31.343 --> 17:32.425
discussions. Some dissertations have dealt with 
policy issues. Some have dealt with law. And some

17:37.270 --> 17:40.493
have dealt with, many have dealt typical 
traditional regional science issues, highly

17:41.080 --> 17:44.984
quantitative. So that went on for a while. And by 
the early 1980s, the department's enrollment had

17:49.430 --> 18:02.465
increased from the original around 30 to about 60 
students.

18:03.566 --> 18:09.012
And that was considered pretty substantial for a 
graduate department.

18:13.970 --> 18:29.427
The next phase of the early 80s, 82, 83, I had a lot of 
health problems and resigned from the department

18:13.970 --> 18:29.427
head position, and David Pugh took over at that 
time. Upon my recovery, about 60, no, I mean 84, did

18:30.669 --> 18:43.403
I say 60?

18:44.682 --> 18:57.404
We had, again, reached the point where

18:44.682 --> 18:57.404
something needed to be done to invigorate the 
master's level programs. And

18:58.206 --> 19:06.420
for various reasons and developments around the 
country, it seemed appropriate to take a look at

19:07.278 --> 19:37.048
one of our emphasis areas and that was the emphasis 
on land development and it had become so popular

19:07.278 --> 19:37.048
with the students that

19:07.278 --> 19:37.048
the then provost gordon eaton suggested that we 
give this planning emphasis its own identity and

19:07.278 --> 19:37.048
so we came up with the master science and land 
development i managed it through the university

19:38.902 --> 19:43.127
and state minefields and got it eventually 
approved. That didn't take very long, did it? No,

19:45.230 --> 19:46.412
it was a record time. In eight months, I think, we 
got the whole thing through. Eight months. And,

19:50.457 --> 19:57.666
yeah, I was... We had a real fine relationship 
during that period, the faculty, with the

19:50.457 --> 19:57.666
provost. He was interested in our work, and he 
pretty much let us do anything we wanted to that was

19:57.706 --> 20:03.093
reasonable. And so that was accomplished. And 
with that, then, the departmental enrollment

20:07.403 --> 20:21.164
increased substantially and is now generally 
between 90 and a little over 100 students. And at

20:21.945 --> 20:36.567
first, perhaps unexpected, the

20:21.945 --> 20:36.567
enrollment in the MS program was at the expense of 
the MUP program. David Pugh and I knew that this

20:37.036 --> 20:41.342
would find its level, and we weren't overly 
concerned about it. Others were, but we were

20:42.103 --> 20:44.847
right. It found its balance, and for the last two 
years, the two master's programs have had about

20:45.668 --> 20:53.819
the same enrollment. Another interesting 
experience from this was that, since there is

20:53.839 --> 21:03.853
commonality, first semester students can... 
change to the other program if they want to after

21:04.255 --> 21:31.326
they get to know things a little better and again 
there seems to be no trend of going from one to the

21:04.255 --> 21:31.326
other it seems some people just prefer the 
traditional city planning others prefer the

21:04.255 --> 21:31.326
entrepreneurial land development but as many 
stand now the doctor program has about 40 percent

21:04.255 --> 21:31.326
of the enrollment and the two master's programs, 
each about 30% of the enrollment. That, for our

21:36.704 --> 21:39.309
present faculty, is manageable. We couldn't 
manage these many students were it not for the

21:40.411 --> 21:51.833
interdisciplinary character of the MS program 
and the doctoral program. Faculty in the business

21:51.853 --> 21:54.478
college and in the engineering college Some in 
liberal arts are as much involved with us and with

21:56.078 --> 22:03.994
these students as our own faculty. So my outlook 
for the future is that this will probably continue

22:04.014 --> 22:14.695
to remain like this with greater and greater 
emphasis on the doctoral program. You can read it

22:18.877 --> 22:23.742
in the Wall Street Journal periodically and 
Forbes and other magazines. There's pressure in

22:24.383 --> 22:36.475
industry and pressure in government that 
higher-level management positions, not only

22:24.383 --> 22:36.475
research positions, somehow require that the 
candidates have a doctorate. And that's not just

22:36.996 --> 22:41.340
in our field, it's just everywhere. there's more 
demand for this and from the faculty's point of

22:41.725 --> 23:06.231
view presents all too good because there's more 
money in it by the same token the masters programs i

22:41.725 --> 23:06.231
think will also increase simply because of the 
goals of the nation and and opportunities that

22:41.725 --> 23:06.231
seem to be very plentiful we have had no period, to 
my knowledge, where our students did not find

23:07.814 --> 23:16.366
jobs. They all did. Yes, even in this era of 
downturned Texas economy, there doesn't seem to

23:18.629 --> 23:25.719
be much problem. There seems to be no problem for 
the planners in Texas. There seems to be a little

23:28.643 --> 23:32.488
problem for the land development graduates, But 
they have found ready acceptance in California,

23:32.789 --> 23:40.559
in Florida, in the Northeast, in Washington, D.C. 
There are plenty of jobs. In fact, people come all

23:42.262 --> 23:51.033
the way from Miami to interview here and have hired 
our people. State agencies such as the Texas Real

23:52.175 --> 23:58.543
Estate Commission have recognized the degree as 
satisfying all of the academic requirements for

23:58.979 --> 24:02.566
any of the licenses under their jurisdiction. The 
California Real Estate Commission has also

24:03.087 --> 24:14.187
accepted that, and so we're in good standing with 
the major regulatory agencies. The Urban Land

24:14.757 --> 24:18.761
Institute has recognized us in a recent article. 
We were listed together with MIT and the

24:18.781 --> 24:31.335
University of Wisconsin and the University of 
Southern California as one of five schools that

24:18.781 --> 24:31.335
actually teach land development. One other thing 
I should mention, if you know on and off, I observed

24:31.395 --> 24:42.688
this interim department head during the last 
three and a half years, because our department

24:31.395 --> 24:42.688
head, Sweeney, is the interim dean. Another thing 
that happened about four years ago, we thought

24:43.023 --> 24:56.119
that the university needed some assistance in 
helping it achieve its own goals. Well, one of its

24:56.860 --> 25:06.111
goals was clearly

24:56.860 --> 25:06.111
described by a panel in the Texas 2000 report, or 
whatever they called the thing, was that Texas A&M

25:06.732 --> 25:13.058
should assume a leading role in urban affairs. And 
nobody knew what to do with that. So at that time, I

25:15.621 --> 25:23.929
just thought it might be time to get all those 
faculty members together who may have an urban

25:15.621 --> 25:23.929
interest. So we organized an urban affairs 
faculty as a very loose association and had a bunch

25:24.089 --> 25:32.638
of meetings and came up with a program. One of the 
program objectives was to establish a center for

25:32.821 --> 25:48.546
urban affairs that would be capable of 
contracting with anyone who wanted to render a

25:32.821 --> 25:48.546
service, and the service would be provided by all 
these experts from the different disciplines.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.089
And it's worked out beautifully. We've had the 
regents allowed us to do that, and we've had any

25:50.149 --> 25:59.824
number of fascinating engagements with private 
interests, And with the major cities in the state,

26:00.142 --> 26:09.152
San Antonio has sort of become our undisputed 
headquarters for numerous activities. And I

26:09.993 --> 26:17.160
finished in Gordon-Eccles recently the 
Riverwalk project. We've been involved in all

26:17.521 --> 26:19.503
kinds of projects. And just about anybody on the 
faculty who wanted to had a chance to do that. We

26:24.709 --> 26:27.972
created professional advisory boards one for the 
Master of Urban Planning, and the five members are

26:28.340 --> 26:43.421
recognized planners of the region, and we created 
another one for the Master of Science in Land

26:28.340 --> 26:43.421
Development Program. It was composed of leaders 
in the industry. For example, Michael Crow joined

26:50.671 --> 26:56.980
us last week as a member, and so we have... I think 
being able to demonstrate to everyone that we can

26:57.955 --> 27:16.453
make a contribution, the university does not 
question that at all, and has supported us

26:57.955 --> 27:16.453
effectively, I think. The profession has 
recognized our contribution, which has been very

27:17.294 --> 27:22.220
substantial. In our recent accreditation visit, 
there were numerous statements made that without

27:23.622 --> 27:32.934
Texas A&M, there would be no Texas chapter. And the 
Texas chapter depends on Texas A&M for numerous

27:33.594 --> 27:46.170
things, not only for the contributions of 
everyone in the faculty, but also for other short

27:33.594 --> 27:46.170
course in this matter. I think one can't ask for 
more. I would think that the state of affairs of the

27:50.535 --> 27:56.782
department is excellent at this point.

27:58.704 --> 28:00.947
Were no longer threatened by the administration? 
Not threatened by anybody. On the contrary. With

28:03.449 --> 28:07.574
being dismissed from the ranks of the university? 
No. No, in fact, on the contrary. Since about 1980,

28:14.095 --> 28:22.346
I think, the university has made peace with that 
and said the program is very solid. And Dr.

28:22.506 --> 28:36.826
Eaton was particularly vocal about that and 
pointed that out on various occasions. Would you

28:36.946 --> 28:41.672
want to comment on the relationship of the 
planning degree programs to the dean's office.

28:46.407 --> 28:50.713
You mentioned Ray Reed, and he was relieved by 
Charlie Hicks. And we had another relationship

28:51.934 --> 28:54.718
there. And then Charlie was relieved by Don 
Sweeney. And our fortunes have varied

29:00.305 --> 29:06.794
substantially, it seems, depending upon who was 
occupying the dean's chair. Well, you would

29:06.814 --> 29:09.016
expect that. It's the nature of it. The academic 
organization is simply that the university

29:14.305 --> 29:34.439
administration depends on the deans to carry out 
their policies, and consequently the deans have

29:14.305 --> 29:34.439
substantial power with respect to budget 
control, and that's really where the key issue

29:14.305 --> 29:34.439
lies. Reed and Hicks were very weak deans who 
didn't even understand their own profession.

29:42.602 --> 29:44.085
They learned the function of a dean. They were 
ineffective. It is tragic that the presidents of

29:47.332 --> 29:56.189
the period were not interested in the College of 
Architecture, or they would have done something

29:47.332 --> 29:56.189
about that. They took more the position as long as 
they don't bother us over there i know they're a

29:58.636 --> 30:28.170
little bit crazy but they don't bother us we leave 
them alone and that was the attitude now that's no

29:58.636 --> 30:28.170
longer the case it has changed completely in fact 
again i would give gordon eaton credit for having

29:58.636 --> 30:28.170
changed that dramatically and you know saying i 
want to see the same uh recognition of that college

29:58.636 --> 30:28.170
and productivity as everywhere else the college 
was not as a whole productive in my judgment it was

29:58.636 --> 30:28.170
has I can find a lot of thought with it. And it is now, 
in the last three careers, I think, finally gotten

30:31.809 --> 30:46.508
to a point where, at the departmental level, 
efforts have been made to raise its prestige and

30:31.809 --> 30:46.508
standards. And I think Don Sweeney, as an interim 
dean, has done a good job in creating a

30:56.990 --> 31:10.646
business-like image of the college, and where 
they don't have the feeling anymore that this is

30:56.990 --> 31:10.646
just a group of rather strange individuals, and 
they wouldn't want to even do it. They pay

31:10.666 --> 31:13.990
attention to us, and they treat us with respect. 
And people who perform, who do what is expected of

31:14.010 --> 31:25.663
an academic person, are well-treated by the 
central administration. That has changed

31:26.504 --> 31:40.054
completely, and we hope that with the new dean who 
is coming in in January, that will continue and be

31:26.504 --> 31:40.054
further strengthened. Many of the faculty under 
Ray Reed and Charlie Hicks had the feeling that

31:42.569 --> 31:52.540
urban planning was simply not understood by the 
Deans. Not only did they not understand it, but

31:53.841 --> 31:57.025
they didn't really much care about it. Well, I'll 
tell you what happened there. That was true, they

31:58.426 --> 32:09.538
didn't understand Deans and understand their own 
world, but since I had established at Adam early on

31:58.426 --> 32:09.538
that I wasn't going to knuckle under to these 
deans, and I would go to the provost, if need be, and

32:09.907 --> 32:19.601
get what I think we had to have in order to do our job. 
They hated that. They were very resentful of that.

32:26.030 --> 32:35.323
And the moment they had an opportunity to undo

32:26.030 --> 32:35.323
what had been gained, they did. And it wasn't until 
fairly recently that I found out, for instance,

32:36.350 --> 32:59.870
that the construction science department 
received, under Hicks, allocations for graduate

32:36.350 --> 32:59.870
assistantships in the amount of about $2,400 per 
capita, whereas we got $500 per capita. It was

32:59.890 --> 33:01.571
outright fraudulent. And it is very, really very 
sad that a central administration allowed these

33:06.657 --> 33:12.288
things to be so badly mismanaged. I think if you 
wanted a classic case of mismanagement, this

33:13.110 --> 33:19.122
college has ample material. In the form of several 
individuals.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.581
That was rumored for some time. about this 
imbalance between the various departments under

33:29.219 --> 33:43.257
Hooke's regime, Hicks regime, but it was only a 
rumor circulating. And as such, of course, it

33:43.297 --> 33:49.285
caused a lot of concern and resentment. Well, it 
was even more tragic with respect to faculty

33:49.665 --> 33:55.733
compensation. You're talking to one who suffered 
from it. It was just unbelievable what was done to

34:00.126 --> 34:02.550
us. And, well, this is past history. The important 
thing, I suppose, is that the Department of Health

34:06.036 --> 34:16.776
and Regional Planning and its two

34:21.717 --> 34:27.684
Creation Center for Urban Affairs and the Center 
for Historic Resources are going to be heard from

34:21.717 --> 34:27.684
in the future. They are a major unit, a major entity 
of urban affairs and urban planning in the

34:28.224 --> 34:35.232
southwestern United States. And the interesting 
thing is, as much as we were

34:35.973 --> 34:50.509
mistreated by our own deans, the outside world had 
looked upon us with great They were awed by all the

34:51.400 --> 34:55.585
accomplishments of the individual faculty and of 
the students. Our students have a tremendous

34:56.125 --> 34:58.007
reputation. The department looks like a giant 
from the outside. And I think it will be more so in

35:02.692 --> 35:05.996
the future. I have great hopes for that. And of 
course, with some of our students having reached

35:07.518 --> 35:14.886
and attained positions of prominence, that 
hasn't hurt us. Henry Cisneros in San Antonio, and

35:15.366 --> 35:18.910
I'm sure Henry Cisneros would be the next governor 
of the state of Texas. And then he would appoint

35:23.115 --> 35:27.359
some of the regents, not appoint some others. 
Right.

35:32.564 --> 35:42.033
Some of your comments do recall for me the 
attitudes at the time during previous dean

35:32.564 --> 35:42.033
checks. And it seemed to me and to others on the 
planning faculty that the more we tried to do the

35:47.324 --> 36:12.066
more it seemed to be resented not only by the 
college at the college level but at the university

35:47.324 --> 36:12.066
level and i think you hit on one point earlier that 
when you arrived here there was a lot of sort of

35:47.324 --> 36:12.066
grandstanding and i think that the university was 
a bit gun-shy of any faculty doing anything that

36:12.552 --> 36:22.363
would involve publicity, and that they might have 
overreacted to faculty trying to do something.

36:23.685 --> 36:41.125
That's very true, and I think that's probably why 
the administrations that I served under and I had

36:23.685 --> 36:41.125
an easy time of working together because, you 
know, in the consulting business, you learn very

36:23.685 --> 36:41.125
quickly, and it becomes second nature to Stay in 
the background. Your client takes the credit.

36:44.797 --> 36:48.261
Your client is the great hero, and you do the work. 
And I adopted and continued the same policy, and it

36:48.782 --> 36:56.690
worked very well for us because nobody criticized 
us for grandstanding effect. Now I hear the other

36:57.090 --> 37:01.855
side, they say, you ought to move your own horn a 
little bit more. You ought to tell the world what

37:01.875 --> 37:03.397
you're doing. I'd rather have it this way than the 
other way around. Well, now that we have three

37:08.172 --> 37:35.192
solid degree programs in the department, and we 
have created two university-wide centers, and we

37:08.172 --> 37:35.192
have other accolades such as David Pugh being 
president-elect of the Texas chapter of APA, and

37:08.172 --> 37:35.192
I've been on the board of trustees of the Society 
for American City and Regional Planning History,

37:35.864 --> 37:40.471
and so forth. All of these things seem to be coming 
into being in a very solid way. How do you take a look

37:45.859 --> 37:57.816
at the future with a new dean coming on board and Don 
Sweeney returning to the department as our

37:45.859 --> 37:57.816
permanent department head in January? What do you 
foresee for the future?

38:05.851 --> 38:13.899
You pointed out a very important thing, that 
topology has played a leading role in the

38:05.851 --> 38:13.899
professions at the national level. Don Sweeney 
works at the Health Association. I'm sure you know

38:17.063 --> 38:20.646
also the director of the American Clown 
Association. I served as the director of the, what

38:21.627 --> 38:29.495
do you call it, Educators Association of 
Collegiate Schools of Clowning. So we've all done

38:29.515 --> 38:31.397
these things. Now we have kind of regrouped, 
decided that you can't do everything. Everybody

38:39.445 --> 38:40.787
can't do everything. So Chewy and David Pugh 
continue to concentrate on the American Planning

38:40.807 --> 38:51.163
Association, American Institute of Certified 
Planners. You do the newly created Society of

38:51.664 --> 38:59.095
Planning Historians. Sweeney does the public 
health thing. I deal with the Irwin Manor

39:02.893 --> 39:04.614
Institute. So we all do different things. I also 
deal with the Institute of Traffic Engineers, and

39:08.177 --> 39:15.044
then I'm a fellow in that institute. And so is 
Virgil Stover. We've covered that. So that I think

39:19.487 --> 39:28.035
our, as a faculty, our reputation is truly 
national. And we continue to broaden this. The

39:30.606 --> 39:34.009
only way you can redo this is through a lot of 
publication. And I think our faculty, hopefully,

39:34.109 --> 39:37.952
will learn that. That is extremely critical.

39:44.438 --> 39:56.149
We have added a research dimension to the faculty 
with Nabil Safat, who has outstanding

39:44.438 --> 39:56.149
credentials.

39:57.074 --> 40:26.355
is very much involved with the National Science 
Foundation on econometric and transportation

39:57.074 --> 40:26.355
theory issues and so we continue to do that next 
year when you retire we will undoubtedly attempt

39:57.074 --> 40:26.355
to find a planner with substantial theoretical 
credentials as well similar to Nabil and thereby

40:26.774 --> 40:34.342
round out the capacity of the department. I would 
also look for the two centers to develop some

40:36.104 --> 40:53.203
staffs over the next two years on a permanent basis 
so that, let's say, by the end of this decade, by the

40:36.104 --> 40:53.203
time that I expect to retire, we will have created 
not only a strong academic unit with an enrollment

40:53.993 --> 41:17.689
of somewhere between 120 and 150 persons but we 
also have created two adequately staffed

40:53.993 --> 41:17.689
research centers and outreach centers we will do 
more on an international basis we are very much in

40:53.993 --> 41:17.689
demand Fulbright grants are available to us.

41:25.436 --> 41:29.943
The AID has approached us again for assistance. 
And so we're involved with a number of foreign

41:29.963 --> 41:33.829
universities. And again, our former students are 
now in leading positions with some of these

41:34.449 --> 41:39.117
universities. So it is a network. And I would 
expect us to do more of this, to network

41:40.499 --> 41:44.605
internationally and both in the academic 
teaching area and in the research area. We were

41:50.678 --> 42:04.939
recently approached by an Australian group to, 
Michael McCarthy, to assist them in developing a

41:50.678 --> 42:04.939
land development program. So I think all of these 
outreach activities will improve our prestige

42:12.243 --> 42:22.257
and strengths, and with that, also give us an 
entirely different position in the college and in

42:12.243 --> 42:22.257
the university. I have every reason to believe 
that Michael McCarthy will be very supportive of

42:23.198 --> 42:36.377
that, affecting conversations I had with him and 
in exchange of correspondence.

42:36.897 --> 42:59.867
continues to express that and also express his 
admiration in a way that we were able to do all these

42:36.897 --> 42:59.867
things with such limited means and i think that he 
is accustomed to much more adequate and much more

42:36.897 --> 42:59.867
liberal budgets he would press for that and so i 
think that the future of the department will be

43:00.320 --> 43:01.422
very, very good. It sends to the national scene a 
return to common sense and urban affairs after the

43:02.464 --> 43:14.868
Reagan fiascos. I think the public is ready for 
solid contributions from the planning

43:14.948 --> 43:22.362
profession and to a large extent under the 
leadership of the major universities, where the

43:22.949 --> 43:35.281
intellectual capacity is to deal with the issues 
that are sometimes seemingly insurmountable. I

43:35.301 --> 43:42.068
think we had a backlash in the early Reagan years of 
anti-climbing, anti-everything, and that's

43:35.301 --> 43:42.068
long gone. You can see it in very conservative 
regions like Texas. Climbing is alive and very

43:45.931 --> 43:49.615
well, and the public says, plan and don't just 
waste our money with ridiculous schemes. There's

43:54.916 --> 44:02.760
this whole issue of the aging population, 
including you and me, that is an area that we

43:54.916 --> 44:02.760
haven't even effectively addressed at all. And 
it's a major planning consideration, policy

44:04.981 --> 44:09.826
planning and physical facilities and all the rest 
of it. So I think that the opportunities are

44:10.147 --> 44:12.910
tremendous. In transportation, we'll be getting 
into the high-speed train era, as the Europeans

44:12.930 --> 44:18.496
have. You can't build any more airports. There's 
no room. How many airplanes can you have in the sky

44:22.400 --> 44:24.702
at any one time? And they're all in trouble right 
now. They're all in trouble. And so I think that

44:27.485 --> 44:29.828
technology new modes in transportation, new 
public policy, new social policy issues that

44:30.230 --> 44:44.550
simply are not wishful thinking or response to 
fantasies, but response to enormous needs. When I

44:44.931 --> 44:58.870
read in the Wall Street Journal that it costs 
something like $25,000 to accommodate

44:44.931 --> 44:58.870
someone in an acceptable retirement home, I mean, 
where is all this going to lead to? That's where I

45:03.547 --> 45:05.149
think planners come in. And I think having laid the 
foundation in our period, you and I, with three

45:05.209 --> 45:20.008
very solid programs that all relate to that and 
interrelate,

45:05.209 --> 45:20.008
the future of this planning program will be 
tremendous. I think it will be a major function on

45:20.248 --> 45:28.198
campus and also a place where people will compete 
for appointments because it would be very

45:29.225 --> 45:36.415
desirable to be a part of this entity. Not that it 
hasn't always been. I think that that is probably

45:38.518 --> 45:42.283
our greatest strength. I think we've all felt 
great satisfaction working together, and we're

45:42.323 --> 45:50.034
very proud of each other. You mentioned one point 
regarding The Reagan administration and so

45:55.246 --> 45:56.968
forth. And it seems to me that both Nixon and Reagan 
have succeeded eventually. It's resulted in

46:04.796 --> 46:10.002
removing the planning responsibility from HUD. 
And all they're concentrating on now is housing.

46:15.488 --> 46:19.532
And affordable housing, I think, is the current 
buzzword. It seems to me that there has to be some

46:20.305 --> 46:29.277
federal agency that has some interest in planning 
as such around the country. And that's got to come

46:30.138 --> 46:33.001
back again in some format. And if it doesn't at the 
federal level, I think that the universities, as

46:34.003 --> 46:41.352
you've entered, have a responsibility. to play 
that they haven't had before. And there's a vacuum

46:44.724 --> 46:46.927
that somebody's going to fill. Yeah, the 
universities are the only place where you can

46:47.407 --> 46:54.035
really create the intellectual and research base 
for all these activities. It has to be somewhere in

46:54.636 --> 47:05.468
the executive branch, a central urban planning 
office, whatever it's called. HUD So my prejudice

47:09.209 --> 47:15.559
is they have never really done anything 
worthwhile since its inception. It was well

47:15.619 --> 47:18.825
intended, but it's been a disaster. And then the 
developments in the housing market, financial

47:20.147 --> 47:29.021
developments have undermined it to the point 
where it's almost really useless. It has to be...
