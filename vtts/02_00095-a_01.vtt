00:02.090 --> 00:17.829
August 30, 1999, sitting in the garden room on Shady Drive of John Griffiths, getting ready to chat with him about his A&M experiences.

00:18.409 --> 00:21.793
And John, use yours, say a phrase or a word.

00:22.835 --> 00:23.816
Well, good morning.

00:24.156 --> 00:26.899
It's nice to have you in our home, Haskell.

00:26.919 --> 00:31.725
And, well, I'm ready to be interviewed as you wish.

00:36.059 --> 00:44.689
John, would you begin by giving a brief biographical sketch of your experiences before you came to A&M?

00:44.749 --> 00:48.633
Where did you grow up and go to school and where did you serve before A&M?

00:49.854 --> 00:53.639
Well, I was born in 1926 in London.

00:55.040 --> 01:00.466
That's the English one, not that upstart in Canada or not even the one in Texas.

01:01.868 --> 01:04.851
And I lived in that region

01:05.287 --> 01:09.053
going to school and going to London University.

01:09.854 --> 01:15.062
It was, as anyone can calculate, the time during the war.

01:15.383 --> 01:26.580
I remained in England, remained in London all that time, so had some very interesting experiences that I think has helped to mould my life.

01:27.722 --> 01:32.830
And then eventually, at the end of the educational period,

01:33.147 --> 01:44.141
I joined what was then called the Colonial, being British, Scientific Civil Service.

01:44.161 --> 01:46.444
And in fact I was the first one they recruited.

01:46.744 --> 01:59.340
The idea of that was to have a specialist in many, many different fields who could be sent to the various colonies when problems in that discipline occurred.

01:59.843 --> 02:08.117
By the time they really got around to this, because it was first mooted in the mid-30s and then the war came along, we didn't have any colonies left.

02:09.139 --> 02:20.738
But I started out by working with the people trying to survey and control the desert locust, an insect that can cover

02:21.157 --> 02:34.120
about 11 million square miles ranging from West Africa to the Indian subcontinent and had some very interesting experiences there in Ethiopia, Eritrea, the Arabian Peninsula and so on.

02:34.673 --> 03:02.014
And then when the locust plague at that time died out, I transferred and took some courses in veterinary science in order to work with the East African Veterinary Research Organisation, located just outside Nairobi, Kenya, and investigate the climatic stress on animals and similar studies.

03:02.905 --> 03:19.902
Then I was asked to take charge of meteorological research in East Africa which then comprised Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika as it was and Zanzibar and there I stayed for a few years

03:19.882 --> 03:39.223
I had the opportunity to get awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship to come and travel in the United States in 1959 and 60, mainly 60, and visit centres of my own choosing.

03:39.710 --> 03:57.373
And one of the main ones was Texas A&M because a gentleman there in the meteorological department, or it was oceanography I met then, of course, Dr. Halstead, was doing some work in a field that interested me.

03:58.895 --> 04:02.359
Ironically, when I arrived here, he had already left.

04:03.115 --> 04:04.898
I never met him.

04:04.998 --> 04:06.961
He has since died, so I understand.

04:07.001 --> 04:24.927
And yet, basically, he changed my whole life because three of the universities that I visited in California, Ames, Iowa, and A&M, then subsequently, when I got back to Africa, they wrote and offered me a position.

04:25.788 --> 04:30.575
I had been taken by Texas A&M, and I thought it had great potential then.

04:30.655 --> 04:32.498
It only had 7,000 students.

04:32.647 --> 04:48.580
and Oceanography and Meteorology were bringing in quite a lot of research money for the whole of the Texas A&M College then, and I enjoyed the people whom I'd met there very much.

04:48.560 --> 04:54.066
and in the department and in other soil and crop sciences, forestry, and so on.

04:54.907 --> 04:57.850
And I decided to make the change.

04:58.851 --> 05:06.660
And I said to my wife, well, I expect we'll be here three or four years, and 38 years later, here we still are.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.224
But being a meteorologist, you'll forgive me for poor forecasts.

05:12.486 --> 05:17.031
I don't know whether in the terminology of your undergraduate days,

05:17.416 --> 05:18.602
there was a major.

05:18.663 --> 05:20.774
What was your undergraduate major called?

05:21.377 --> 05:24.152
My undergraduate major was called

05:24.470 --> 05:50.747
special mathematics in which I was later fortunate enough to get a first-class honours with distinction and at the same time I took courses that enabled me to have a special diploma I suppose one could call it in theology which has always been an interest of mine and then I followed it up by

05:51.233 --> 06:01.875
changing colleges within the university and took physics and statistics and of course meteorology.

06:03.137 --> 06:09.310
And part of what you worked on in Africa with the locusts, a biologist could have claimed, couldn't he?

06:09.779 --> 06:28.007
Yes and I was sort of responsible for taking measurements, observations, general comments and so on of the atmospheric part of the environment and how these affected the locus themselves and so we would

06:29.033 --> 06:55.429
take the body temperatures of the locusts because they change color from green to black and when they get black they get more gregarious and that starts off the swarms and of course you have to have the rain for the eggs to become viable they lay a part of about 200 eggs when there's not much moisture up come the hoppers as they're called look around there's no vegetation very much at all

06:55.628 --> 07:02.319
nothing to eat, they're mainly in desert regions, and so they wait for the next hoppers to come up and they eat those.

07:02.981 --> 07:04.643
So that keeps the population down.

07:05.104 --> 07:13.198
But when they get caught in what we call the intertropical convergence zone that moves with the solar movements,

07:13.178 --> 07:43.185
and that brings rain as well, helps trigger rain and so there's vegetation, everybody's happy, they're eating away and they're not eating each other and these swarms begin to start and then they get enough temperature, heat worked up being insects and they're cold-blooded and they start flying around and meet other groups and so we get swarms covering thousands of square miles

07:43.942 --> 07:47.228
You said you came first to A&M to visit in 1959?

07:48.350 --> 07:52.157
Actually, I arrived here in April of 1960.

07:52.177 --> 07:53.379
60.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.321
Yes.

07:54.902 --> 07:56.786
And where had you heard about A&M?

07:56.846 --> 07:59.591
Was it word of mouth or printed?

08:00.012 --> 08:07.806
It was reading various articles in the subject we call sort of micrometeorology, small scale.

08:07.786 --> 08:31.363
because I've always been interested I didn't want to get into forecasting I wasn't too keen on that I like the applied of being certain practical aspects that people in other disciplines could use and although we are not too good at forecasting I always felt that we knew enough

08:32.018 --> 08:41.012
about the small scale variations in the weather and the climate to be able to help people in agriculture, architecture, entomology, you name it.

08:42.033 --> 08:51.748
Who were the, as far as you were aware before you got here, who were the key A&M faculty members in meteorology?

08:52.859 --> 09:17.027
Dr Leeper was trained as a meteorologist and he came here in 1949 started the Department of Oceanography then of course I've always had the greatest respect for Bob Reed who came in 1951 who was very well versed in meteorology and in fact he

09:17.530 --> 09:24.240
supervised, chaired a number of the earlier PhDs in meteorology.

09:25.482 --> 09:37.159
Then also in that field, a little tangential, but were this Holstead and Bill Clayton.

09:38.841 --> 09:39.042
All right.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.744
Describe that first visit.

09:40.864 --> 09:41.906
How did you get here?

09:42.487 --> 09:43.568
What did you see?

09:43.588 --> 09:45.170
So forth.

09:45.191 --> 09:46.913
Well, when I first came,

09:47.551 --> 09:49.234
Of course I landed in New York.

09:49.375 --> 10:05.205
I flew in about a 14-hour flight in those days and spent a very icy first week because by then it was at the turn of the year, December and January, up in New York.

10:05.658 --> 10:15.090
because I had to check in with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Munitalp Foundation who had also helped fund me.

10:16.011 --> 10:24.462
Munitalp being a sort of anagram, a backward anagram of platinum for people who had made some money in that metal.

10:25.223 --> 10:29.168
And in New York I bought a car by the

10:30.025 --> 10:56.674
help of a friend of a friend that I knew in East Africa and so I drove around went down to Washington to pay my respects to the Weather Bureau as it was then and then drove further down visiting institutions especially in Florida and so on where they were doing work in atmospheric effects on plants and animals and so on then I drove across

10:56.654 --> 11:09.166
through Louisiana, came into the Piney Woods and landed up at Texas A&M where I was made very welcome.

11:10.167 --> 11:20.797
I remember I was assisted in finding a sort of efficiency place at a motel halfway between College Station and Bryan.

11:20.837 --> 11:24.361
At that time you could tell that there was a difference between two cities.

11:24.421 --> 11:25.902
There was a grassy area

11:26.540 --> 11:39.254
And I remember extremely well that the cost for that motel with its efficiency and all that one really needed was $17.50 per week.

11:40.735 --> 11:43.458
And it was in easy striking distance.

11:43.959 --> 11:48.063
I could drive the car into A&M, no problems in parking.

11:49.344 --> 11:55.551
And one of the most intriguing

11:56.138 --> 12:06.333
memories that I have of this, I think, was that after writing a number of postcards and so on, I asked Dr. Lieber, where can I go to to mail these?

12:06.494 --> 12:23.479
Of course I said post these, being British, and so he told me, and it was only about 150 yards away, to the Northgate Post Office, and that journey took me about 45 minutes, because

12:23.982 --> 12:42.248
Every few yards I was stopped by somebody saying, I'm Fish Smith, sir, from Paducah or wherever, Dallhart, which meant nothing to me at that time, and they were terribly friendly, but I almost forgot where I was going.

12:43.950 --> 12:48.977
But it really did make an impression on me, and that...

12:49.362 --> 13:04.922
camaraderie has really still persisted and I found of course that it was typical of the whole of Texas basically and I have to say that this was one of the main reasons why I returned here was the friendliness.

13:05.803 --> 13:08.687
Another reason of course was

13:08.667 --> 13:22.606
being offered a job and Africa at that time was becoming a location in which it was clear there was no future for the likes of ourselves.

13:22.747 --> 13:25.410
My wife was teaching at the university at the time.

13:25.470 --> 13:38.168
We met in East Africa actually and after I got back from the visit to the USA and my wife was in some sort of trepidation because

13:39.127 --> 13:49.341
her contact with Texas was to see the film Giant, and so the first question she said, are there any trees there?

13:49.361 --> 13:55.049
And, of course, we know the answer to that, and now we have settled in very much.

13:56.010 --> 13:59.836
We were located, of course, in Goodwin Hall at that time.

13:59.876 --> 14:02.940
Describe the department and its facilities.

14:04.186 --> 14:30.835
The department I think was in an enviable position at that time because I mentioned earlier that it had much of the research funding which allowed it a bit of flexibility and as I understand it reading and asking more questions about the situation

14:32.131 --> 15:00.636
the fiscal situation in the earlier years, let me say the 1950s, which would basically cover the whole period because we didn't start until 49, and I came in 60 and then permanently in 62, was that they juggled the funding to bring in people to teach whilst also really getting most of their salary, if not all, from the research.

15:01.173 --> 15:22.735
And this of course, the two go hand in hand and when a department is starting up with fundamentally outside sponsored research, I mean the agricultural engineering still had their Texas money coming in and some federal, this was about the only way that it could be done.

15:22.776 --> 15:28.041
And so it had really got on its feet.

15:29.455 --> 15:56.323
Meteorology came under one of the branches of oceanography, meteorological oceanography and there was biological and physical and chemical as well and with their sort of section heads and we met for seminars once a week and I was invited a couple of times to speak to these and as I say

15:56.877 --> 16:05.034
Everybody within the department was so welcoming and around campus, very hospitable.

16:05.755 --> 16:16.557
The facilities were basic one would say, but I think they were improvement over what they had had in the very earliest days.

16:16.958 --> 16:22.665
But there was sufficient space and all that one needed.

16:22.705 --> 16:32.997
And of course, at the time, the most, the major component of the student body was the Air Force.

16:34.338 --> 16:42.848
Because in the mid-50s, I think it was that they, I'm just checking a date here,

16:42.828 --> 16:57.343
We had the basics students, as they were called, and they came in from the Air Force, the first class was in 1953, for one year.

16:58.252 --> 17:14.821
They had degrees in some subject, not necessarily even in a science type of subject, and they in one year got what was called the basic training for meteorologists to go out and actually forecast.

17:15.983 --> 17:20.631
And this has been a very strong part

17:21.185 --> 17:25.452
of the Department of Meteorology all the way through.

17:25.512 --> 17:42.640
It has become limited now, we have many more civilian students than military but we still have a component of these and we have just started again recently, I think it was last year, to have a new basics class.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.323
Now I think they came in this summer

17:44.557 --> 17:49.269
and so there's about four or five of them at this stage.

17:50.111 --> 17:57.148
So this was interesting to be in an environment where most of the students were wearing uniforms on one day of the week,

17:57.618 --> 18:00.161
And that was something new to me.

18:00.201 --> 18:11.112
And I think also what interested me was the range of courses that were being taught within the department.

18:12.153 --> 18:24.165
And although, as I mentioned, I'd been offered jobs elsewhere, these universities did not, or those campuses, did not have a department of meteorology.

18:24.668 --> 18:48.938
and I felt that since my graduate training was in meteorology I would perhaps get to push to one side and I have seen with other examples that this is very often true and one of the reasons why I decided well I'd come to the oceanography and meteorology department as it was then

18:49.272 --> 19:00.868
meteorology getting a strengthening program through the mid-50s and in 1956 became the Department of Oceanography and Meteorology.

19:02.029 --> 19:15.668
And so we had a separate section and by the time I came back in 1962, Dr. Vance Moyer was then the section head.

19:16.137 --> 19:29.177
As you, after that first visit, as you now understand it, what process took place in the department before they made you a formal offer of a faculty appointment?

19:31.720 --> 19:42.837
As I have gleaned it, that's all, because I wasn't privy to this or wasn't here at the time even, it was a case of Dr. Leeper,

19:43.340 --> 19:48.777
who was a very kind fellow and he was

19:49.347 --> 20:16.823
he knew that he wanted to build up his department and he spoke with the meteorology section faculty as to whether they thought I should be made an offer and they didn't have anybody at that time who was responsible for teaching climatology or the statistical concepts of it and that was one that I had

20:16.803 --> 20:32.557
I had also taken a diploma in statistics, and evidently everybody agreed, and so they made an offer, and... Was this verbal or written?

20:32.577 --> 20:44.768
I did get a written letter, that was all, from Dr. Leeper, and saying that this would be the salary, I think it was the assistant professor, $9,000 a year.

20:45.862 --> 20:50.171
I'm assuming a 12-month appointment.

20:50.191 --> 21:05.845
Well, I had the good fortune whilst over here on the Rockefeller Fellowship to meet a lot of people who were very well known in the climatology and applied climatology, which we often call bio-climatology.

21:05.825 --> 21:35.528
field including a meeting at the Pentagon with a number of people who were dealing with the effects of the atmosphere on the military and materiel and all this sort of thing and after that meeting a couple of them kept in touch with me and asked if I was interested in submitting a research proposal to

21:35.508 --> 21:43.830
collate and analyze data for certain parts of the world with the military in mind and I said yes

21:44.300 --> 22:07.995
I was and they said well you know this could be arranged even though you're overseas it would not have been so easy of course but this was later in the fullness of time after about a year 18 months or so about 18 months was awarded so that I was able to come over here with a research program

22:07.975 --> 22:24.651
in operation as soon as I hit the floor sort of thing and so of course it was a nine month appointment and the research would support me for the other three months so that in a way I was cushioned for this.

22:24.631 --> 22:40.885
Because I have always found it a bit incongruous, I think, that people on a nine-month appointment or less than 12 months do not earn vacation time.

22:40.865 --> 22:58.434
so they earned sick leave which of course is justifiable but I also think that the other should be awarded but there you are it wasn't the case and it isn't the case and so I was fortunate right from the beginning to be on what's effectively a 12-month appointment.

22:59.055 --> 23:02.721
Now you began as a faculty member in

23:03.106 --> 23:27.274
62 I came here in August 62 all right describe and your wife came with you she came about three or four weeks later because I had to go with one of the faculty members then who became very good friend a dear friend who died a few years ago Professor Henry and he and I went down to Central America

23:27.828 --> 23:33.102
in order to try to track down data that will be relevant for the research.

23:34.004 --> 23:44.031
Describe, you and your wife, your location of housing for you when she arrived.

23:44.399 --> 23:57.732
Well, I had seen, when coming in 1960, driving around, what I thought were just standard apartments.

23:59.995 --> 24:09.544
So I said to her, well, we'll be able to get an apartment while we were, of course we called it a flat, being from England, and then we'll look for a house.

24:09.885 --> 24:12.267
Well, of course it transpired that I had made a mistake.

24:12.327 --> 24:14.389
I was looking at the student housing,

24:14.369 --> 24:44.359
the old student housing there almost now University Drive and I think I'm approximately correct which is the best any meteorologist can do there was just about one block of apartment down towards Bryan at that time and so I was really more or less forced into looking around for housing and with the advice of people around in the department I was shown

24:45.149 --> 25:09.655
number of houses because it was not long after the Bryan Air Force Base had closed so there'd been a bit of an exodus and there were homes on the market but they'd either remained vacant for a few years or had been rented short-time rentals to people so they were not in the best condition but eventually I found one to

25:10.580 --> 25:27.182
my liking and the liking of my purse at the time on Winding Road and decided that was it and then spent the next three weeks in great trepidation thinking, I hope Joan likes this.

25:27.222 --> 25:28.944
Oh dear, this is our first home.

25:28.964 --> 25:29.826
What have I done?

25:29.986 --> 25:32.549
I've committed myself.

25:32.569 --> 25:38.477
But she did settle into it very well and we enjoyed our time there.

25:38.913 --> 25:44.540
How did the two of you feel you were received by the local community?

25:45.721 --> 25:48.064
Oh, very well indeed.

25:48.525 --> 25:56.154
I think they sort of adopted us as a sort of Texas Limeys.

25:58.097 --> 26:05.646
Very friendly indeed and would say, well, I like your accent and...

26:05.626 --> 26:09.533
I think there were times when, of course, they didn't understand us.

26:09.834 --> 26:15.525
And, well, we knew that was the case because one of the things that we both like is buttermilk.

26:16.587 --> 26:22.117
And we were going to a restaurant and asked for buttermilk and they would say warm milk or anything.

26:22.137 --> 26:24.461
And I said, no, buttermilk.

26:24.481 --> 26:26.385
And then they would say, oh, buttermilk.

26:26.855 --> 26:28.358
Yes, yes, buttermilk.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.744
So we got to learn how to say buttermilk.

26:31.764 --> 26:36.312
And just little things like that which were very humorous, really.

26:36.693 --> 26:45.268
We used to, because of the way of shopping in Europe, make a pilgrimage on Friday after five o'clock.

26:45.721 --> 27:15.019
times were very strict then you worked from 8 until 5 and not 10 minutes to 5 and we would drive out to the big metropolis of Snook where there was Lawrence Grocery and we could buy fresh meats and nice cheeses off the wheel and so on and this was quite a little safari into the countryside we might even stop for some kolaches

27:16.349 --> 27:20.173
Describe your first duties.

27:21.194 --> 27:27.661
What classes did you teach and what research did you begin as you joined the faculty?

27:27.681 --> 27:42.036
I'll start with the research because I've already just mentioned it and that was this obtaining of an analysis of data mainly rainfall precipitation from Central America

27:42.573 --> 27:55.653
in order to find out the likelihood of heavy rains, distribution of the rainfalls, peculiar situations that they had with regards to weather systems and so on.

27:56.314 --> 27:58.437
So that took care of the research.

27:58.958 --> 28:02.083
Then I developed

28:02.063 --> 28:19.752
course in statistical meteorology I've always been a believer that whilst I know that statistics is wide-ranging in science that it helps people if examples of

28:20.322 --> 28:48.625
are brought out for their own discipline and so we tried to avoid that terrible word at the time duplication of courses and so that was one course then I had to develop and reorganize courses in what we would call physical and regional climatology

28:48.605 --> 29:15.827
everyone being expected no matter what their research was and so on I'm sure you found this the same you taught three or four courses per semester a three course semester was a light load at the time and so that that kept us busy because of course in between was we had to do some traveling to go down and get these data when we

29:15.807 --> 29:42.186
got clues as to where it may exist and although this wasn't in the first year but after about three or four years just to quote an example down in Bolivia I was getting almost nowhere in trying to get data they had no organized meteorological service as such it had come and gone with the revolutions

29:42.166 --> 29:54.979
and I was in the second biggest city there, Cochabamba, and I'd gone to an engineering firm because I'd heard that they had a network of stations.

29:56.401 --> 30:08.173
So I sent a card in and the secretary ushered me in to see the director of this company, and he looked up, smiled,

30:08.153 --> 30:12.580
took off a ring, put it in front of me and said, do you recognize that?

30:13.462 --> 30:16.106
And he goes without saying, it was an Aggie ring.

30:16.687 --> 30:19.111
And from then on, everything went smoothly.

30:19.131 --> 30:23.158
I think we got as many of the data as we possibly could have hoped.

30:23.493 --> 30:34.369
And it was right by the skin of one's teeth, as they say, because I was literally walking up the steps of the aeroplane.

30:35.691 --> 30:37.414
None of these tunnels to get onto them.

30:37.494 --> 30:40.759
In those days, you walked half a mile across a hot runway.

30:41.245 --> 30:48.171
when a young man came running out with a great pile of papers and handed them over to me, and those were the data.

30:48.992 --> 30:55.718
So we had some very pleasant experiences, but that tied in with the research aspect.

30:57.619 --> 31:05.987
Surely you have some good anecdotes about a person with a fine English accent teaching Texans.

31:07.648 --> 31:09.970
There must have been some good stories from class.

31:10.540 --> 31:26.018
Well, one of the main ones that kept occurring was my problem with trying to get around some of the names and their pronunciations.
