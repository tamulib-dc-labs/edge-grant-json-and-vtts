WEBVTT

00:08.030 --> 00:14.460
Okay, we were talking about incorporation, and I 
had a question about Bryan. Since Bryan was a major

00:14.981 --> 00:19.388
city, it was possible that you could be annexed. 
Did the residents around there not want? Cottage

00:23.274 --> 00:35.252
station residents did not want to be incorporated 
in the city of Bryan, and they opposed it, at least

00:23.274 --> 00:35.252
actively and verbally. It never came to the matter 
of law. Now, when I started the development of

00:40.098 --> 00:53.357
North Oakwood addition, which we spoke of a while 
ago on the north side of the campus, that area, of

00:40.098 --> 00:53.357
course, lay between Bryan and College Station. 
And I was sending the property mostly to College

00:54.739 --> 01:02.050
Station people.

01:03.599 --> 01:05.541
And they did not want to be. When I say they, I'm not 
trying to speak for all of them. They had a little

01:09.485 --> 01:12.088
division of groups. But College Station would 
just get out of the way. They had no tax system, no

01:15.592 --> 01:25.843
system of giving utilities and the usual city 
services that you get from towns, like

01:15.592 --> 01:25.843
maintenance of streets and things. Brian did. 
They offered to take care of the street

01:30.565 --> 01:42.647
development, install the streets better than I 
had, and the utilities, particularly sewer

01:30.565 --> 01:42.647
system. So

01:42.667 --> 01:48.979
I arranged to have a vote. We might have had, oh, I 
had 200, 300 lots in there. but probably, oh, maybe

01:54.157 --> 02:00.645
50 people, 50 families, perhaps, lived in there. I 
just called them together and took a vote where

02:00.946 --> 02:08.716
they wanted to make an application to come in the 
city, College Station city limits or Bryan. And

02:09.637 --> 02:12.961
they voted unanimously for Bryan because, yeah. 
See, Texas Avenue was a dirt road at that time, and

02:12.981 --> 02:21.953
they was building about an 8 or 10-inch water main 
from the city limits clearing on the outskirts.

02:22.456 --> 02:32.089
out along this barbecue place, Landy Sims 
Barbecue. So they voted for that and we went into

02:32.109 --> 02:34.832
that system then. And of course I promoted it as 
best I could because that way we had this

02:36.334 --> 02:46.748
out-of-town tax system again. And

02:51.751 --> 02:53.933
It was getting hard to handle. Had to take care of 
that. Now there's a young heroic man by the name of

02:56.296 --> 02:59.779
Jim Astin. Oh, yes. City manager? Huh? City 
manager of Bryan? Yeah. He was city manager of

03:04.965 --> 03:06.366
Bryan. Very aggressive young man and brilliant, 
smart man. He was president of the Republic Bank in

03:10.651 --> 03:16.517
Dallas, which is the only Republic Bank here. Oh, I 
didn't know that. Yeah. He was a great athlete out

03:19.898 --> 03:24.865
of A&M, a little after my time. I was 29, he was about 
33. But, see, I owned the utility lines. I owned the

03:31.955 --> 03:32.837
streets. I hadn't even dedicated them to the 
public. I owned, that is, Oakwood Rent-A-Cup,

03:36.702 --> 03:39.987
because my own Oakwood Rent-A-Cup. So he 
propositioned me to buy those utility lines.

03:43.552 --> 03:46.216
Well, I said, doggone anxious to get rid of them. 
And I'd have probably given them to him if he had

03:46.236 --> 03:48.319
asked me. But he paid me $30,000 or $40,000. Oh, 
really? Which would be $300,000 or $400,000 now.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.455
Oh. That's what inflation is then. And of course, 
that made it possible for me to do other things out

03:59.699 --> 04:05.125
there that I'd been wanting to do. So then, by that 
time, then I dedicated the streets to the public.

04:10.010 --> 04:14.695
So the public owned the streets, like county roads 
and streets and cities and such. And it's after

04:16.042 --> 04:22.590
that that the residents decided to ask to be 
annexed into Bryan? Yes. OK. Well, what about the

04:23.351 --> 04:28.457
residents around College Station, around the A&M 
campus? Why didn't they want to be annexed to

04:28.537 --> 04:30.679
Bryan? Was there any? Oh,

04:31.460 --> 04:40.851
I hardly know the word to use. Not necessarily 
stubbornness. They just wanted their own town.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.337
They wanted their own town. They just wanted their 
own town. And they'd always lived outside of

04:46.619 --> 04:49.203
Bryan. They didn't want to be any part of Bryan, and 
still don't. Yeah, that's right. If you want to get

04:52.949 --> 04:57.696
yourself in a terrible row, you can go out here and 
start making speeches. Let's join Bryan. Either

04:58.718 --> 05:01.582
chambers of commerce. Maybe you read lately. Now, 
see, we had two separate chambers of commerce for a

05:03.885 --> 05:06.509
long time. But after the war, I guess World War II, 
they joined the two chambers together. and have

05:11.206 --> 05:13.149
one, Bryan College Station. But now there's some 
agitation for Bryan College Station to have its

05:13.169 --> 05:18.075
own chamber of commerce. I don't like that. I don't 
see it either. Well, they have different offices,

05:20.759 --> 05:22.881
don't they? Oh, yeah. But they're one. So 
basically, they just wanted their own town, felt

05:25.465 --> 05:30.411
like they could best provide for their own needs. 
Well, you were living in College Station at that

05:30.431 --> 05:33.615
time? I've always lived in College Station. Were 
you in favor of incorporation then? Were you in

05:39.083 --> 05:40.905
Negroes? College Station? Yes, indeed. I 
certainly was, yeah. I promoted every way I could,

05:45.110 --> 05:49.436
except as being an officer. I never was a 
councilman or mayor or anything like that. But I

05:54.061 --> 06:00.809
certainly used what little influence I had to 
promote the city of College Station. The

06:02.131 --> 06:03.573
cemetery, for example. I promoted that cemetery. 
You were president of the cemetery. Yeah. Well, I

06:08.688 --> 06:09.749
owned the land. I owned the land at one time. Well, 
can you tell me about that? Well, yeah.

06:21.521 --> 06:27.868
I was real active in business enterprises, well, 
from the middle 30s on. The war developed, as I was

06:30.451 --> 06:37.238
telling you, on the south side when the Japs raided 
Barrel Harbor. I knew I was going to have to go in the

06:37.437 --> 06:43.305
war, because I had a commission as a reserve 
officer. I was first lieutenant in infantry. So

06:47.211 --> 06:54.401
right at the beginning of that dark Sunday day, I 
began to make plans to be called. And I was. And I

06:55.062 --> 06:59.108
went in April of 42, just two or three months later. 
Well, we didn't have anything out in Amabank. Just

07:04.696 --> 07:07.360
didn't have any facilities at all. And we needed a 
bank, needed a bank. And I was the principal,

07:10.183 --> 07:14.148
because I had this construction going on down 
there. And I'd average, make one trip a day, at

07:15.810 --> 07:21.516
least, to Bryan Bank. And of course, get my payroll 
over there on Fridays. And I had done a little work

07:27.543 --> 07:30.546
on the bank.

07:34.424 --> 07:47.197
I got a good deal of discouragement from that, but 
then I was caught up and forgot about it when I spent

07:34.424 --> 07:47.197
about two and a half years in Europe during the war 
while I was in the Air Corps in a heavy bombardment

07:34.424 --> 07:47.197
outfit. And I used to ride home to my wife and some 
other friends and tell them the things we had to do

07:47.217 --> 07:55.946
when the war was over. If you got back. And my first 
priority was that bank. That was the bank, which is

08:00.170 --> 08:02.693
the University of Nashville now. That was the 
first priority. And the second was a hotel or

08:05.608 --> 08:08.553
something. We didn't have, we had the Blue Bonnet 
Motel over at the East Gate, little wooden shacks,

08:08.573 --> 08:16.885
about eight or ten of them, called the Blue Bonnet. 
And that's the only facilities we had for

08:16.905 --> 08:20.670
overnight people. Had the LaSalle Hotel and 
Bride, you know, and then we didn't have a

08:21.351 --> 08:27.921
cemetery. And I, during my experience, had come up 
that we needed a cemetery out there. We had to go to

08:34.782 --> 08:40.828
Barron Brothers County, had to be in Bryan, you 
know. A lot of people came to Illinois and other

08:40.848 --> 08:46.153
states, they'd ship the bodies back there to 
Barron. Those were my, well, those were my first

08:46.854 --> 08:49.696
three priorities. Another one we had to have was a 
hardware store. I was in the building business and

08:52.900 --> 08:56.423
I had to go to get a pound of nails. Everything that I 
eat, I had to go to Brian. I was wearing a Rhodes hat.

09:02.456 --> 09:16.755
Well, when the war ended, I wrote to 50 people or 
something like that to have a meeting on the bank.

09:16.775 --> 09:17.596
We had the meeting. And not the charter for the 
bank. We measured from May the 1st, 1946. I got in

09:24.045 --> 09:26.308
October of 45.

09:31.418 --> 09:46.543
Then,

09:31.418 --> 09:46.543
now as for the hotel, the student center, I joined 
with a former student, and we created and raised

09:31.418 --> 09:46.543
the money for the student center. And it had, oh, 
say, 100 rooms in it for a guest, you know, for a

09:47.384 --> 09:52.212
hotel. And I never could conceive of never needing 
any more rooms than that. So that took care of that.

09:58.986 --> 10:04.617
So you were...

09:58.986 --> 10:04.617
Goodbye, honey. Bye-bye. See you tomorrow. Nice 
to meet you. You were involved in the student

10:08.926 --> 10:11.972
center meeting? And through the former student 
association, I was active with the former

10:12.357 --> 10:19.125
students, not individually. I mean, don't say 
that you couldn't say that I helped create it. I

10:23.269 --> 10:26.613
worked with the students to raise the money to get 
it done. And that solved that problem. Then my next

10:28.815 --> 10:30.217
one was the cemetery. You know where it is. Right.

10:35.463 --> 10:39.107
I got a little committee together. including Mr. 
F.W. Hensel, who was an architect, a landscape

10:41.059 --> 10:50.773
architect, and went down and bought the lands from 
50 acres by Mr. Gorisky.

10:53.998 --> 10:55.360
And that's where the cemetery is. G-O-R-I-S-K-Y, 
something like Gorisky.

11:03.191 --> 11:04.834
And that's where the cemetery is now. Now, I had the 
cooperation... from the university, at least

11:07.792 --> 11:12.839
through President Gilchrist. He was president of 
the university at that time, and he was very eager

11:12.859 --> 11:20.250
to have a cemetery out here. And I got some ideas 
from him. I was going to lay it off in sections, one

11:23.594 --> 11:31.205
for presidents, a little section where only 
presidents would be buried. And perhaps you

11:31.926 --> 11:36.212
didn't know that down across the railroad track 
You know what's called a hard liquor track? Right

11:40.513 --> 11:44.858
across from it, there's a cemetery over there with 
one prison buried in it. Who was that? I can't say

11:46.159 --> 11:48.742
his name. But you've got a little tombstone down 
there with this marker. It's still down there?

11:52.967 --> 11:53.127
Yeah. Because I read that they had tried to make 
arrangements to move all the bodies down there to

11:53.408 --> 12:01.297
the cemetery. Did they not ever, did that ever... 
They never did do that. They were going to when

12:04.200 --> 12:05.862
they... When they built the dormitories, number 
what, dormitory 20 or 30 or 40 or whatever the

12:06.145 --> 12:16.180
numbers are, you know where they are. Over there on 
the, by the drill

12:17.342 --> 12:22.570
field. There's two or three graves there, and they 
moved them. And they moved them down there to this

12:28.519 --> 12:31.403
place I'm talking about. I don't think there's any 
presence in them. There was a grave by the drill

12:34.917 --> 12:40.062
field that's on Canyon Campus? Yes. That's at 
Westgate? Is it at Westgate, the drill field? Is it

12:46.289 --> 12:47.210
at Westgate? Is it what, honey? At Westgate. Oh, 
no. No, it's a, let me see. Well, you know where the

12:58.301 --> 13:00.783
president's home is. Yes. That cross toward me. 
The Texas Avenue? The big open space? That's

13:08.509 --> 13:10.171
where... Where the mess hall? Right. The graves 
used to be there? Yeah. Okay. And they moved them to

13:13.856 --> 13:15.819
across the railroad tracks. Right. Uh-huh. 
Wasn't but two or three. But the present now, how

13:18.823 --> 13:22.088
his grave ever got over, I never found out. But I 
thought it was pitiful that him to be over there.

13:26.995 --> 13:28.357
And nobody knew anything about it. And I ran an ad in 
the Texas Aggie that anybody knew any of the

13:28.397 --> 13:33.865
relatives of this present that I described before 
he was, and he was over there alone by himself, and

13:34.537 --> 13:48.212
kind of pitiful and not like to move his body, and we 
had to go through some law to get him to move a body.

13:49.493 --> 13:56.520
And I finally found a distant relative in Abilene, 
and had some correspondence with him, but he

13:49.493 --> 13:56.520
faded. I don't know whatever happened. But 
anyway, that's when we got the cemetery, that Mr.

13:58.482 --> 14:02.989
Gilchrist was ready for it. But when we took it up to 
the city of Cotton Station, I said, I'm going to

14:03.009 --> 14:11.722
have a private cemetery, develop it myself, sell 
the cemetery lots, which is common. A lot of the

14:11.742 --> 14:14.887
better cemeteries are that way. But the city of 
Cotton Station bust up. They wouldn't go in on it.

14:20.856 --> 14:23.119
So I said, well, do you want the cemetery? Yes, we 
do. So I sold them the land. And that's where the

14:26.140 --> 14:27.902
cemetery is now. Oh, I see. That was my second 
priority. And weren't you on the cemetery

14:30.345 --> 14:34.930
committee that decided? Well, locating it, I 
didn't have anything to do with designing the lots

14:35.391 --> 14:47.105
and laying out the rules and regulations in that 
cemetery. Do you remember, I had heard something

14:47.585 --> 14:53.312
to the extent of on that land, it's a huge tract, And 
then part of it was already... There's a little

14:56.495 --> 14:58.117
place in there. Perhaps an acre. That land belongs 
to this family whose name I gave you. I don't know

15:06.849 --> 15:13.177
from how long, way back in 1875 or something like 
that. Their religion was Methodist. And they gave

15:17.803 --> 15:20.667
the... National Methodist Association, the 
whole thing, not just the local Methodist. An acre

15:27.484 --> 15:29.947
or two acres, whatever's in there, and it's still 
there. Those old markers are still in there. Is

15:33.490 --> 15:36.113
that what they refer to as Old Shiloh Cemetery? 
That's right. Is that just that acre? Or, okay, I

15:38.836 --> 15:40.518
was curious. It had steel fence around it. I 
haven't been down there lately to see if that steel

15:42.200 --> 15:45.263
fence is still there. But they still own that. Oh, 
it doesn't belong to the city? No. Oh, I thought it

15:49.787 --> 15:52.150
did, but it belongs to the Methodist Church. To the 
Methodist Church. That's interesting. Yeah.

15:55.796 --> 15:55.996
Okay. I was going to ask some more questions about 
incorporation. You were in favor of it, and do you

16:01.505 --> 16:09.096
remember who pushed the hardest for 
incorporation? Do you remember the meetings?

16:12.261 --> 16:14.665
Well, probably. I can't probably... Mr. Ernest 
Langford was one. Mr. Ernest Langford was a mayor

16:21.320 --> 16:25.244
for, oh, quite long. I don't know how long. But he 
was head of the architecture department. Mr.

16:29.149 --> 16:30.891
Hensel, F.W. Hensel, he was a landscape 
architect, a wonderful gentleman, a great friend

16:30.911 --> 16:36.699
of mine. We worked together on the city. Did he help 
your, I had read that he had helped College Park,

16:38.561 --> 16:44.909
had helped kind of landscape College Park. Did he 
do that for Oakwood, or? No, I didn't use it on

16:47.030 --> 16:49.813
Oakwood. North Oakwood, he designed it, laid it 
out in lots and lots, but we didn't have to actually

16:50.634 --> 16:58.003
do any architecture, decoration, and things like 
that. But he worked on the College Station

16:58.503 --> 17:01.106
Cemetery. Oh, that's right. Yeah, he worked on 
that. A man named Joe Orr, who was a civil engineer,

17:05.031 --> 17:15.723
he probably surveyed it out, put those postmarks, 
you know, around the corner. That's right. I read

17:16.023 --> 17:16.564
that he did that. the only one that comes to me right 
now. But we got the cemetery and the bank and the

17:22.096 --> 17:32.713
hotel

17:22.096 --> 17:32.713
and finally got a hardware store out there. What 
hardware? It was called Lloyd Smith Hardware at

17:34.175 --> 17:36.379
the time. It's over there at the North Gate. You 
know where the Baptist Church is? The building

17:42.368 --> 17:45.053
right across the street from the Baptist Church. 
It was a brick building. That's where we put Lloyd

17:47.837 --> 17:50.281
Smith in the hardware business. I got it financed 
for him through my connections. And that was so

17:54.528 --> 17:58.414
probably 19... He was there before the war, about 
1941 or two, something like that. No, I mean after

18:04.720 --> 18:08.285
the war, right after the war. And then I kind of put 
myself and my own business in, operating the

18:10.147 --> 18:15.855
thing. Got the bank going, as I told you, and it went 
broke. Oh, okay. I want to ask you about the bank,

18:22.124 --> 18:26.049
but let's see. Before I do... You were talking 
about your building at Southside. Was it called

18:31.563 --> 18:33.085
Burgess Building? It's referred to that. Yes, 
uh-huh. Did you lease part of it to the city as city

18:36.470 --> 18:39.514
offices? Yes, you're sure right. Mr. Colonel 
Anderson mentioned that this morning when I

18:41.457 --> 18:44.461
talked to him. See, they leased. The city of 
College Station had one office up there. I had

18:51.571 --> 18:54.675
operated three offices, and the city had one. Oh, I 
see. I had my own little private office in an

18:56.545 --> 18:59.548
architecture. Art Tech had an office. And then we 
had an insurance office up there, too. And how long

19:08.176 --> 19:11.198
did they rent the city out? Well, the city left 
there pretty soon after World War II. They built a

19:17.024 --> 19:21.628
property over on the north side, down by the 
railroad track. Uh-huh. The first city office?

19:22.409 --> 19:22.609
Yeah. They built their own property down there and 
moved out down there about War was over in 45,

19:27.275 --> 19:33.601
probably in 47 or something like that they moved 
out. Apparently they were at Northgate, in an

19:34.241 --> 19:40.787
office at Northgate, and then they moved into your 
building? Yes, they had a little, just one little

19:42.449 --> 19:46.573
room there at the Northgate.

19:49.515 --> 19:54.640
I don't remember how much it was, but I built that 
building there on the south side. They moved down

19:54.720 --> 19:57.062
there, and they were there five, six years. Okay, 
and then they moved into their offices. Yeah. And

20:00.773 --> 20:12.085
you were telling me earlier about College 
Station, then when they incorporated, they

20:00.773 --> 20:12.085
bought the lines, your utility, your sewer, your 
water, your... Right. They bought them from the

20:12.746 --> 20:15.109
developer themselves? Well, from the open-ready 
company that owned them. Yeah, I put those

20:20.875 --> 20:22.457
utilities in there. And was this the case for all of 
the divisions that were... Well,

20:27.603 --> 20:34.171
there really wasn't one at that time, not just me. 
At that time, when I bought those lots from College

20:35.633 --> 20:42.421
Park, then I got the whole business. And our 
tourist disposal plant ran out across Well, we had

20:48.848 --> 20:54.497
a disposal bed, not very far from where the present 
high school, College Station High School is. Way

20:54.557 --> 20:56.160
off down there, you know. Oh, the present one. 
Yeah. Okay. We had a disposal system down there.

21:03.391 --> 21:05.514
And the city bought all of that from you? Yeah. 
Uh-huh. Put it in their own system. Now they carry

21:07.377 --> 21:10.021
it way on down across Highway 6. Way off down there. 
That's what the... That's where the present

21:14.498 --> 21:17.762
disposal system is, way off down there. Highway 6 
says you're going out of town, or Highway 6 says

21:17.962 --> 21:23.308
you're going out of town? Yeah, it goes in that 
facility. Oh, I'll have to look for it. Can you see

21:26.111 --> 21:27.593
it on the side of the road? Oh, no, honey, it's way 
off down in the sticks. Okay. Well, after the city

21:30.937 --> 21:35.462
became incorporated, how adequate were the 
services? I mean, did you feel like there was an

21:35.482 --> 21:38.265
increase? Oh, yeah. As far as fire? Sure, yeah. 
Well, they just had people that would do the job. I

21:47.706 --> 21:52.073
didn't have anybody employed except a garbage man 
to pick up. If we had electrical trouble, I had to

21:53.695 --> 21:58.342
hire a private electrician to go down there and do 
whatever was necessary. And the electric

21:59.283 --> 22:03.830
company, of course, was getting that from A&M, 
too. They installed the poles and the wiring and

22:04.030 --> 22:09.598
made the inspections and such as that.

22:12.413 --> 22:15.175
That the city did that, you're saying? When the 
city was organizing, they took over all that. They

22:17.698 --> 22:19.239
took over that. How about the schools? Did you feel 
like, do you have children? Yes. Did you feel like

22:24.444 --> 22:27.767
the schools provided education? Yes, they had 
excellent schools, high schools. In fact, we

22:30.489 --> 22:40.178
always felt, it might have been a little jealousy 
or something, we felt our educational services

22:30.489 --> 22:40.178
for children exceeded Brian's because I had many 
teachers. Most of the teachers were husbands and

22:41.607 --> 22:45.911
wives of the college staff. They were highly 
trained, you know. And

22:48.674 --> 22:54.099
what about the upkeep of roads? Well, when the city 
organized it, of course they took over the upkeep

22:56.041 --> 22:59.564
of the roads. Before the city, we just had to do it as 
it needed, yeah. And so you felt like it improved?

23:06.451 --> 23:07.952
Oh yes, it greatly improved. Did you feel like the 
council was responsible, responsive to the needs

23:08.793 --> 23:14.499
of the citizens? Yes, the council, we've always 
had a very fine council in this city. They were

23:19.965 --> 23:21.667
politicians, you know. It's like any other 
politician, but they were educated people, and

23:21.687 --> 23:37.163
they were devoted to their job, and they wanted to 
do what they're supposed to do to maintain the

23:21.687 --> 23:37.163
comfort and ease and the peace of getting around. I 
think the College Station area has been

23:39.387 --> 23:50.923
particularly fortunate in having that kind of 
people to serve as the mayors and councilmen, as we

23:39.387 --> 23:50.923
do today. Very high class people. Do you feel like 
they've shown, in the past, they've shown a lot of

23:53.065 --> 23:57.992
foresight as far as planning? Absolutely. They 
sure have. Yeah. You mentioned Colonel Anderson

24:02.458 --> 24:07.605
before, and so I was going to ask you, some 
information you are friends with Mr. Anderson oh

24:07.838 --> 24:28.926
yeah he's one of my most beloved old gentlemen he's 
a track coach one of the athletic coaches here he's

24:07.838 --> 24:28.926
a fine athlete himself from Mississippi came here 
about with Mr. D.X. Bible about 1919 after World

24:28.986 --> 24:36.276
War I he was an officer in World War I And he got the 
title of colonel in World War I? Well,

24:41.611 --> 24:52.125
I think he was a captain or maybe a major when he came 
out of the service, but he stayed in the reserves

24:41.611 --> 24:52.125
and was promoted to colonel. And he was called back 
in duty in World War II, but he didn't stay very

24:53.147 --> 24:57.252
long. He was asked to be relieved, getting old. I 
think he's 90 and 91 now. Oh, he is. Oh, my heavens. I

25:07.821 --> 25:09.644
want to give you his number if you don't mind, 
Judge. Do you have his number anywhere? No,

25:10.745 --> 25:14.510
sir. Telephone number.

25:20.919 --> 25:29.670
And

25:20.919 --> 25:29.670
he's awful proud of being married one time. That's 
what I'd like to talk to him about. He didn't

25:33.327 --> 25:34.629
believe in taxes. Don't you dare say Mr. Burgess 
said you didn't believe in taxes. Don't say that.

25:43.681 --> 25:46.645
But when he was married, he didn't want any taxes. 
Not even property

25:47.206 --> 25:51.331
taxes? No. I've kidded him about this many times. 
He can take it. I'm kind of kidding you. But he lived

25:58.120 --> 26:00.744
down there on Fairview Street. Mm-hmm. bought a 
house from the college and moved it down there. And

26:04.065 --> 26:05.126
I sold him the property. And those were dirt 
streets, gravel top, you know. And a little hole

26:14.815 --> 26:18.179
developed out there, probably as big as an 
ordinary wash tub. Not that deep, of course, but

26:18.839 --> 26:22.843
water stood in it for days and days. And some 
smart-aleck people down there put a little sign up

26:22.923 --> 26:27.088
there. No fishing allowed by order of Colonel 
Anderson. And he saw that, and he had no real

26:30.196 --> 26:35.126
automobile, and you wouldn't know about that 
either. And a two-wheel trailer, he was going

26:35.667 --> 26:38.993
behind it. He went out somewhere and drove right 
up, and that thing fell to the ground and fell in his

26:39.414 --> 26:44.644
fishing hole. They took his sign down. I'll kid you 
about that. Oh, how funny. That is funny. We talked

26:52.103 --> 26:58.050
earlier about zoning, and apparently zoning has 
always been very important in college stations.

26:58.090 --> 27:00.092
Yes, right from the very beginning. Did you like 
that idea of zoning, and why? Well, because you

27:03.736 --> 27:08.122
could control the type of house and what was to be 
done to it. My addition, the Oakwood addition, was

27:08.883 --> 27:12.707
the first area between Dallas And I got that from 
the FHA, this man, I tell you that. You had to, as a

27:17.176 --> 27:21.972
residential area, that's what it was. We not only 
controlled by a contract, I'd give you a deed to the

27:22.863 --> 27:30.671
property, and that kind of contract, what you 
could do with that property. You had to build a

27:31.092 --> 27:42.304
house so many feet from the sideline, so many feet 
from the front line, and it had to be certain square

27:31.092 --> 27:42.304
feet of area, say a minimum of 1,200 square feet. 
That's just an ordinary, a very ordinary two or

27:42.464 --> 27:46.368
three bedroom house. See? It controlled the size 
of the house and architectural design. and where

27:52.563 --> 27:54.967
it'd be located on the lot. You couldn't go closer 
than 30 feet to the street line. Meet sidelines, I

27:57.871 --> 28:01.216
remember 12 feet, meet sidelines. So it makes the 
area look nicer. Well, yeah. Well, Bryan has never

28:05.182 --> 28:08.227
adopted zoning. They have no zoning. Do you know 
why they didn't adopt zoning? Well, they just

28:12.733 --> 28:17.120
never did when they organized the town way back 
there. Now, there's certain additions to the city

28:18.121 --> 28:20.545
of Bryan. For example, my North Oakwood addition 
is in the city of Bryan, but it's highly zoned. It's

28:26.920 --> 28:27.901
highly zoned. A lot more than the South Oakwood 
addition is. And of course, that helps sell that

28:33.007 --> 28:35.691
thing. It helps sell it. Because people know 
they're going to have homes. You couldn't have an

28:38.474 --> 28:43.160
automobile shop next door to you or something 
else. It had to be a single family residence. But

28:46.725 --> 28:49.468
just because Bryan was started earlier in the 
history that it was really never adopted? Yeah,

28:52.718 --> 28:55.901
Rydler started about 1800 and what, 40? 40. 
Somewhere in the 40s. Very old. And they never

28:58.964 --> 29:00.446
dreamed of zoning. They never had it in their mind. 
You call a peace property, you do what you want to

29:01.647 --> 29:06.031
with it. And of course, we had a little trouble with 
that, especially in North Oakwood, on rooming

29:06.051 --> 29:16.242
houses and one thing or another. One doctor was 
going to sue me. And I invite him to. Let's see if

29:21.065 --> 29:22.427
these things any good. Let's do it on a friendly 
basis. You just sue me, and we'll see how we come

29:24.069 --> 29:26.773
out. Well, of course, by that time, Zoni had become 
very popular, and it was popular out there. A lot of

29:34.544 --> 29:39.091
people bought it from me out there because it was 
on. Excuse me. I don't remember where we were on the

29:42.115 --> 29:44.278
bank. I substantially organized that by letters 
to friends who were overseas during the war. I was

29:49.884 --> 29:51.086
in Europe. And when I came home, I got home in 
October of 45. I might say I just hit the ground

29:57.354 --> 29:59.376
running. And we obtained a charter. We had some 
opposition

30:05.103 --> 30:14.055
in getting a charter from other banks in the area. 
Uh-huh. We didn't have an institution out here at

30:14.515 --> 30:18.461
all, any banking institution at all. Had to go to 
buying. And it was an awful nuisance, as much as we

30:21.365 --> 30:25.892
were doing. So we got a bank, called it the College 
Station State Bank, and capitalized it. But we

30:36.790 --> 30:45.121
couldn't get any building material because it had 
to have priorities from the veterans coming home

30:36.790 --> 30:45.121
from service. Everything you'd have to get a... I 
had a word for it, I can't say it. But you'd get a

30:51.630 --> 30:54.173
little form for building material. And some of it 
wasn't available at all, except to a veteran. And

31:00.482 --> 31:05.228
we were able to get a little... hut that was 16 feet, 
well, not very much bigger than this hall office

31:06.052 --> 31:12.482
right here. This looks like it may be 12 by 12 or 
something. We got two of them, put them together,

31:16.227 --> 31:19.632
and made 16 by 32. It was a plywood building. We 
could almost cut it up with a knife. That was our

31:26.322 --> 31:28.425
first bank site. We opened the bank and started 
business. Where was the umpane? It was over there

31:34.402 --> 31:37.386
on Jersey Street at the North Gate. Excuse me. I 
think the Presbyterian owned that building

31:40.671 --> 31:42.793
there. And I forget what it's called. It's a solid 
concrete building. You know where Wyatt's, what

31:48.581 --> 31:54.930
is that little concrete building next to Wyatt's? 
That bookstore there, sporting goods store,

31:56.132 --> 31:59.256
whatever it is. That was the building. That was the 
bank until we bid it where it is now. It's a

32:04.920 --> 32:06.282
university national now. We changed from a state 
bank to a national bank.

32:12.753 --> 32:23.250
I was one of the originators of the bank, served on 
its original board, and was the vice president and

32:12.753 --> 32:23.250
executive officer. The bank went broke. I had a man 
in there running it that had been on the examining

32:25.938 --> 32:30.044
course. And I thought it was awful lucky to be able 
to get him.

32:36.813 --> 32:44.364
But he just didn't have what it takes to make a 
banker, couldn't control his loans, and lost all

32:36.813 --> 32:44.364
of our capital. And we had to reorganize the bank. 
And I was one of the principal organizers.

32:54.068 --> 32:58.014
the commissioner wouldn't let the man we had 
running it come back in there at all. And I never had

32:59.977 --> 33:07.528
the bank experience, but they wouldn't let 
anybody else run except me. So I went in and

33:07.548 --> 33:19.806
operated the bank about, oh, eight months or a year 
myself and rebuilt it, reassessed our

33:07.548 --> 33:19.806
stockholders for some money to rebuild the 
capital. And this was University National?

33:22.890 --> 33:29.556
Shortly after that, we changed it from a state bank 
to a national bank, and we called it the University

33:22.890 --> 33:29.556
National. And we got the bank back on its feet, and 
it's been doing very well since then. That's

33:36.443 --> 33:37.183
wonderful. Do you remember the man's name? Lamar 
Fly. Oh, yeah, I've heard that. Yes, Lamar Fly was a

33:45.852 --> 33:48.274
wonderful fellow. He grew up in a bank in Houston. 
It was a whole state bank, I believe they called it.

33:58.005 --> 34:00.429
Anyway, his father ran the bank. He just grew up in 
it. Got a banking degree from Texas University and

34:03.032 --> 34:08.821
was an examiner, National Examining Force. And I 
thought we was awful lucky to get him. And it was. He

34:13.287 --> 34:19.155
knew what he was doing, but he just didn't have any 
intestinal fortitude to talk to people. Right, it

34:19.405 --> 34:21.107
takes that. They could just do him any way they 
wanted to, and they found that out pretty quick. He

34:25.573 --> 34:31.761
lost the capital of the bank, of course, and that 
just ruined us. What year was it that you had to

34:32.021 --> 34:34.164
reorganize? 1940. 1948. 1948. I

34:35.345 --> 34:46.720
read that you were the president of the Chamber of 
Commerce in its early years, is that right? Yes,

34:46.740 --> 34:49.243
they had a local Chamber of Commerce out here. and I 
was the president of it. Was Bryan and

34:51.123 --> 34:54.366
Constitution one chamber of commerce then? No. 
No, they were two. That's when they separated. I

34:58.670 --> 35:02.413
was also a vice-president of the Bryan Chamber. 
I'd been a chamber of commerce man all my business

35:03.594 --> 35:07.117
life.

35:11.942 --> 35:17.847
Do you like the fact that it is bringing in 
industry?

35:18.248 --> 35:21.153
Well, I'd have to say I do, being a businessman. I'm 
getting up to an age where I like peace and quiet.

35:27.943 --> 35:34.133
But I know that we've got to prepare for the future 
of this community, for the future people in it. And

35:35.496 --> 35:41.886
I believe that College Station and Brasses County 
as a whole is really on a boom. And I think it's going

35:41.906 --> 35:43.328
to hold. Do you like the way that the character of 
the town has changed? Do you see the character of

35:46.637 --> 35:49.041
the town changing? Well, I can't say that I really 
like it, but if you ask me why, I couldn't answer

35:49.061 --> 35:54.308
that. I wouldn't want to try to make any move. For 
example, Bryan, as you know, the town of Bryan, the

35:56.812 --> 36:00.477
main street, is dead. Oh, yeah. And that's kind of 
sad. But it's brought it on itself. We just got to

36:06.482 --> 36:08.784
give in to progress. These little malls that 
scattered around, they're so new to us, to me, that

36:08.804 --> 36:20.859
I can't conceive of them really continuing on an 
exciting success. You've got little stores

36:22.160 --> 36:27.266
scattered around here, and another mile or two, 
another batch of stores, you know? Right. Oh, I

36:27.967 --> 36:29.449
agree. I don't see how it could go, but it is. It 
seems every time somebody starts one, it fills up

36:32.853 --> 36:36.317
with business houses. As far as the people are 
concerned, was it more of a tight-knit group in the

36:37.939 --> 36:46.549
early days because of its size? No, I don't think 
it's any particular group. I think that the times

36:48.832 --> 36:56.261
just sort of developed itself. It just naturally 
developed. A person would go out here, and this

36:59.324 --> 37:02.488
land for development purposes, awfully high, 
high priced. Then you've got the expense of

37:07.289 --> 37:11.015
development, subdividing it into lots and 
blocks. Given ordinary residential section,

37:11.435 --> 37:18.806
say, of 100 acres, probably at least 20 acres will 
be in streets where you can't sell. You have to give

37:18.866 --> 37:20.228
it away. Well, of course, the other property, you 
could put lots in there. Those lots carry the cost

37:25.356 --> 37:29.202
of the property that you're giving away. And it's 
expensive. When a man goes to buy a lot to build on,

37:31.579 --> 37:34.062
it's high. High priced. But then the big money in 
the land is the commercial development of it. If

37:42.053 --> 37:53.988
it's located where it can have a store or two, a 
little shopping center, they can get several

37:42.053 --> 37:53.988
times the price per square foot on commercial 
property than they can get for residential

37:42.053 --> 37:53.988
property. So that encourages the developer to to 
develop a little commercial site wherever he is. I

38:01.930 --> 38:03.396
did that way back there. My first one was on the 
south side that we spoke of a while ago. when I had to

38:08.011 --> 38:11.134
get ahead of the city of College Station. I didn't 
really know what I was doing, but I knew that the

38:11.694 --> 38:19.422
best way for me to come out on that property was to 
sell the commercial property at a high price.

38:19.442 --> 38:21.404
Right, that's right. And it's still working that 
way. You see the town going in that direction more,

38:22.705 --> 38:28.671
more in a commercial area? Yeah. Because it's more 
profitable. That's right, yes. Well, I

38:33.135 --> 38:35.537
appreciate this very much.
