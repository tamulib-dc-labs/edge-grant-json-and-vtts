00:01.432 --> 00:10.100
...with Mike Sullivan by Tammy Lawrence on March 
14th concerning the Vietnam War where he more or

00:01.432 --> 00:10.100
less had a scenic tour in combat. In the 
interesting of accumulating knowledge about the

00:11.201 --> 00:19.969
war, I'm going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M 
Oral History Collection and University

00:11.201 --> 00:19.969
Archives. Is this all right with you, Mr. 
Sullivan? Yes. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit

00:24.773 --> 00:29.177
about, tell me where you were born and the day of 
your birth? I was born in Lubbock, Texas,

00:30.001 --> 00:33.426
September the 20th, 1943. When I was in 11th grade, 
I'd been to 11 different schools. My father was

00:40.057 --> 00:41.700
killed in World War II. My mother remarried, and my 
stepfather started putting in Hertz rental car

00:42.962 --> 00:49.692
stations all over Texas and Louisiana. And I 
graduated high school in Alamo Garden, New

00:50.634 --> 00:53.438
Mexico. After graduation in 1962, I went to Texas 
Tech, graduated there in 1966.

01:07.485 --> 01:14.134
Okay, Mr. Sullivan, can you tell me a little bit 
about the reasons why you joined the military and

01:07.485 --> 01:14.134
the years that you were in service?

01:17.939 --> 01:24.628
My last semester of school, my draft board had 
tried to get me tried to draft me three times my last

01:25.604 --> 01:29.167
semester before I finished. And so I was motivated 
at that point to go into a service that I had little

01:30.148 --> 01:37.114
choice about. And I chose the Army. He chose the 
Army. So after you graduated from school, you

01:41.018 --> 01:47.924
volunteered in the service just because they were 
pressuring you while you were in school to join?

01:49.926 --> 01:51.687
That was partly it. I was planning on going into the 
Army anyway. I didn't really know what i was going

01:55.777 --> 02:25.716
to do in my professional life and i thought it would 
give me a little time to think about that too were

01:55.777 --> 02:25.716
you kind of motivated since your dad fought in 
world war ii uh oh i guess i was somewhat i guess most

01:55.777 --> 02:25.716
men think that the military is just a natural part 
of their life and you just kind of do that at some

01:55.777 --> 02:25.716
time in your life i did anyway So what year was it 
that you started? I joined the Army in 1966. I

02:30.558 --> 02:35.825
enlisted in the Army as a private E-1. Went to Fort 
Knox, Kentucky for basic training, advanced

02:37.026 --> 02:43.634
armor training. And then I went to Officer 
Candidate School. Graduated from that in May of 67

02:48.900 --> 02:55.348
as an armor officer. And I went from there down to 
Fort Polk, Louisiana, to a training company

02:56.510 --> 03:04.620
there. From Fort Polk, I came down to order for 
Vietnam in 1968. I

03:10.066 --> 03:23.682
went to, before going to Vietnam, I went down to 
Panama to go to Jungle Warfare Training School.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.326
which was a three-week program. And then I left 
there and went on to Vietnam. And I got there in

03:34.175 --> 03:39.821
May of 68. At the train school in Panama, what kind 
of train were they training you in? You said

03:47.130 --> 03:47.891
jungle. Can you go in a little bit more detail? 
Well, the canal zone, I believe, is on the 9th.

03:53.868 --> 03:59.837
degree of latitude, which is the same latitude 
that runs through Vietnam. So it had the same type

04:01.960 --> 04:08.910
of temperament as far as weather and vegetation 
and climate goes. So they're trying to get you used

04:09.190 --> 04:12.795
to the climate and the weather? Right, acclimated 
to the vegetation and What you need to, it's also a

04:16.970 --> 04:28.542
survival type training in case you got out into, 
you know, a jungle in which you could live off of

04:16.970 --> 04:28.542
animals and certain plants and that kind of stuff. 
But it was, it ran about 20 hours a day for three

04:29.423 --> 04:36.110
weeks of training. You got about three to four 
hours to sleep a night, if any. And you had night

04:41.055 --> 04:42.376
operation. It was all infantry oriented tactics. 
Such as? Which is just, uh, infantry is the ground

04:49.037 --> 05:11.597
soldier type, you know, for, uh, like you'd have, 
say, a class on what you might call like an L-shaped

04:49.037 --> 05:11.597
ambush for instance, and this is the way you set it 
up and you just practice, uh, things like that, uh,

04:49.037 --> 05:11.597
you had escape and evasion, uh, training, uh, all 
different types of plant and vegetable, what you

05:13.079 --> 05:32.478
could eat and couldn't eat, what was poisonous, 
not poisonous, medicinal plants that were

05:13.079 --> 05:32.478
available, how to survive weather-wise, where to 
get water from, either from plants or from the

05:13.079 --> 05:32.478
ground, just survival type stuff. Did you feel 
like this training in Panama helped you more in

05:32.498 --> 05:41.247
Vietnam than if you hadn't had it? Yeah, it was real 
good. What was probably more realistic than the

05:45.832 --> 05:52.101
training was the number of hours that you spent 
awake a day. So they had you used to staying up long

05:52.802 --> 05:58.689
hours and going out without sleep for a while. 
Right. And what that does, it also kind of trains

05:59.290 --> 06:01.593
you. These were all officers that were down there. 
And it kind of trains you. It shows you what happens

06:07.441 --> 06:11.166
to you when you get tired. And you get a little 
mentally, you know, pressed a little bit because

06:11.568 --> 06:18.681
they really press you during the school. And so 
it's the same type of pressures that are there

06:19.723 --> 06:25.895
every day in Vietnam. So you might as well just get 
used to it. And if you can see how it affects you,

06:28.139 --> 06:32.968
then you're better able to control your people and 
understand their situation. Understand what

06:36.066 --> 06:41.813
they're going through and probably have a little 
concern over them whereas if you didn't

06:36.066 --> 06:41.813
understand. Right.

06:50.225 --> 06:50.325
Okay. When you got, when you were going besides 
this training in the field and stuff, they talked

06:50.345 --> 07:00.038
to you about the Vietnamese culture such as their 
religion and the ways they lived over there? Well,

07:00.498 --> 07:01.740
uh, in your incoming orientation in Vietnam at uh 
in Long Ben uh they had a a small class on the

07:02.446 --> 07:31.322
cultural aspects and the politics a little bit of 
the region it wasn't very much not very much at all

07:02.446 --> 07:31.322
no

07:02.446 --> 07:31.322
you're talking about a day a day that's all I told 
you yeah then you find it quite hard okay let's

07:31.572 --> 07:37.919
Before I get to that question, let's go to, you're 
on the plane, you went by plane over there, and

07:31.572 --> 07:37.919
where did you land? At Long Bend. Long Bend. Yeah. 
Can you go on from what you did the first time you got

07:41.364 --> 07:44.808
there? Well, how'd you feel about going over 
there? Were you anxious or were you... Well, I

07:49.413 --> 07:53.698
think everybody... You're probably a little 
apprehensive because it's new, it's unknowing,

07:54.404 --> 08:01.492
it's dangerous.

08:04.275 --> 08:11.824
You've heard all the bad things, and you don't know 
how you're going to react as an individual under a

08:04.275 --> 08:11.824
lot of stress.

08:15.708 --> 08:21.795
My consideration was I felt like I wanted to be an 
officer because If I was going to get killed, then

08:22.484 --> 08:25.749
I'd like to have a little bit to say so about it. You 
could determine what you were going to be. Right.

08:29.594 --> 08:31.076
At least I'd have some say so. I thought, you know, 
and if I made a mistake, then it was my mistake and

08:31.277 --> 08:39.449
not somebody else's mistake. And that was one of 
the things that motivated me to go to OCS. So what

08:44.276 --> 08:46.679
officer, what was your rank? When I was a first 
lieutenant in Vietnam, I was an armor officer.

08:55.193 --> 09:08.049
After I went through the initial incoming 
orientation there, I was assigned to the 4th

08:55.193 --> 09:08.049
Infantry Division up at Pleiku. And we went to 
Pleiku, and I was assigned to the 2nd Squadron of

09:09.070 --> 09:16.660
1st Cavalry Regiment. It's the oldest unit in the 
United States Army. The cavalry? Yeah. Second and

09:22.070 --> 09:24.072
first calf, what they call it. What did you do 
there? When I got for two months, I was the,

09:28.197 --> 09:40.110
what they call the S1, assistant S1, which was an 
administrative type function. Officers, when

09:40.911 --> 09:46.557
they go over there, spent six months in 
administrative capacities and six months in the

09:40.911 --> 09:46.557
field. So my, normally. That's kind of the way it 
broke down. I got up there, and there again, as a

09:54.516 --> 10:06.789
personal preference, I wanted to, there again, if 
I was going to get killed, I just didn't get killed

09:54.516 --> 10:06.789
the first six months as opposed to the last six 
months, you know, so when I put it off, I worry about

09:54.516 --> 10:06.789
it. Because most of the administrative positions 
were not that dangerous, you know. You might be in a

10:14.669 --> 10:21.480
in a base camp somewhere and they, you know, they 
shoot artillery and, uh, you know, have sapper

10:14.669 --> 10:21.480
attacks and stuff like that. But, uh, it's just 
kind of chance type stuff. It wasn't, wasn't

10:24.244 --> 10:27.850
really too dangerous at all. Uh, but part of my 
duties being in that capacity was I attended the

10:29.072 --> 10:41.031
evening briefing for General Stone, who was 
commanding general at 4th infantry division. And

10:41.720 --> 10:43.683
it was just kind of like you see in the movie. You got 
all the maps on the wall. There are the good guys,

10:45.905 --> 10:47.547
the bad guys. And you got to see how everything, the 
Army, the Navy, the Air Force, you had special

10:47.587 --> 11:00.624
forces, people who had mercenaries that were 
working in the area. You had the ROPS, which was the

11:00.784 --> 11:06.972
Republic of Korea, how those people functioned in 
the system. And you got to see how it all kind of fit

11:07.152 --> 11:11.558
together, which I thought was real interesting. 
One

11:12.415 --> 11:32.799
of the G5 of the 4th Division, which has to do with 
psychological warfare and civil affairs, their

11:12.415 --> 11:32.799
assistant G5 was leaving. He was leaving country 
and going to go back to the United States. So G5

11:36.583 --> 11:41.629
asked me if I wanted to come up and be assistant G5 on 
general staff. for the 4th Division. I said, let me

11:44.431 --> 11:47.434
go back and check with my unit. So I went back and 
talked to my boss, who was the S-1. I said, when am I

11:50.097 --> 11:51.679
going to get a platoon? And he said, well, I don't 
know. Well, the deal was my boss was from West

11:57.265 --> 12:00.989
Point. All of the officers in this particular unit 
were from West Point except four. There's my son.

12:07.777 --> 12:07.937
And S-1? In the whole unit, the second and first 
half, everybody in it was from West Point. And it

12:14.274 --> 12:15.396
was... They kind of resented y'all getting... 
Well, let's just say they looked after the West

12:15.416 --> 12:25.112
Pointers first, and if something else happened, 
yeah, they'd stick somebody else in there. Well,

12:25.753 --> 12:26.775
there was myself. I went to Texas Tech, and I was an 
OCS graduate, and that's how I got my commission. A

12:33.365 --> 12:34.988
guy lived next door to me. was from Texas A&M. He got 
his commission through ROTC. There was another

12:41.118 --> 12:45.743
kid from New York who was in OCS with me. He was a week 
ahead of me. And he got his commission in OCS. And

12:51.550 --> 13:00.420
then there was General Abram's son, John John, who 
was a couple weeks behind me in OCS. And he got his

13:00.600 --> 13:05.346
commission in ROTC, I mean in OCS. So we were the 
only four reserve officers in the unit. Everybody

13:08.801 --> 13:10.103
else was from West Point. So I asked my boss, when 
was I going to get a platoon? He said he didn't

13:14.588 --> 13:15.769
really know. And I said, well, you know, you've had 
two lieutenants from West Point come in. So they

13:18.272 --> 13:20.034
got their platoon as soon as they got there. So I've 
been there longer than them. And he said, well,

13:22.177 --> 13:23.898
that's just the way it is, Lieutenant. I said, 
well, fine. So I went back and talked to the G5 and

13:26.041 --> 13:29.445
see if the job was still open. He said, yes. And I 
said, well, I would take it then. And so I went back

13:32.697 --> 13:35.741
and told my boss that I was quitting there. He said, 
well, you can't quit. And I said, yeah. I said, I

13:37.845 --> 13:38.546
can. I said, I'm going to. And so, because General 
Staff calls the shots. And they are the ultimate

13:47.839 --> 13:50.383
authority there. And so I knew I could get on 
General Staff. So I went up and I was Assistant G-5.

13:55.811 --> 14:00.578
Well, my boss, the G-5, was... air defense 
artillery officer and he stayed there for another

14:02.549 --> 14:31.577
couple of months and then he was replaced and he 
went back to the states and my new boss was an

14:02.549 --> 14:31.577
armored colonel and i walked up to him reported sir 
lieutenant sullivan and he said who are you i said i

14:02.549 --> 14:31.577
possess the g5 he said not for long you're not he 
said lieutenants belong in the field not on

14:02.549 --> 14:31.577
general staffs So you got to go to the... And, you 
know, so he said, where'd you come from? I said,

14:37.396 --> 14:38.538
well, second to first cab. He said, you want to go 
back there? I said, no, I don't want to go back

14:39.580 --> 14:41.082
there. You know, I burned some bridges there, and I 
didn't want to have to go back and have to rebuild.

14:48.213 --> 14:49.716
And he said, well, where do you want to go? Well, the 
infantry units had what they called mechanized

14:50.036 --> 14:58.830
infantry, which is armored personnel carriers. 
and they had infantry people who rode around and

14:59.502 --> 15:04.811
armored personnel carriers. They had 1st and 22nd 
Infantry, but I didn't want to go there either,

15:05.833 --> 15:15.009
because I'd seen too many bad things happen to 
armored personnel carriers. Because, I mean, one

15:16.692 --> 15:22.422
little mine or something, they blow them apart and 
nobody survives, you know. And I just think too

15:23.093 --> 15:25.456
much of that, and I didn't want that. But then 
there's the 1st and 10th Cav, which is another

15:26.217 --> 15:32.787
armored unit, armored Cav unit, which is 
basically the same thing. I didn't like that. And

15:34.189 --> 15:38.795
then there's another unit, 1st and 69th Armor, 
which was straight armor or all tanks. Well, I like

15:39.897 --> 15:42.781
tanks, so I chose the 1st and 69th. And so I got out, 
and I was a platoon leader with the 1st and 69th

15:44.043 --> 15:52.695
Armor. And we, at this particular time, we were 
operating north of Cameron, north of Quignon, up

15:53.418 --> 16:10.441
in a place called like the Antelope Valley and 
around Bongsong and 506 Valley, LZ English. So you

16:11.062 --> 16:12.864
drove tanks? Right. I was a tank platoon leader. I 
had five tanks and 19 men under my command. And then

16:18.973 --> 16:20.415
we just went around. I was a I was attached to the 
173rd Airborne.

16:27.269 --> 16:42.012
So, they told me, he said, well, like my first day, 
he said, well, you're going to be assigned to

16:27.269 --> 16:42.012
Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry 
of the 173rd. He said, they're in such and such

16:42.593 --> 16:45.738
location, go find them. So I did, and... How'd you 
get, I mean, did they fly you, helicopter you into

16:49.274 --> 16:55.784
where they were, or were they just real close to 
you? Uh, no, from, from the tank unit? Yeah. No, we

16:59.530 --> 17:01.273
just drove our tanks, you know. Okay. What was the 
scenery around? Uh, the, the, the terrain, uh,

17:03.997 --> 17:16.176
was, uh, kind of mountainous, and, uh, then along 
the coastal areas was, was kind of, uh, You know,

17:16.696 --> 17:21.161
sandy, beachy type places like you'd see on any 
beach. Real pretty, lots of vegetation. But if you

17:25.526 --> 17:31.853
went inland a little bit, then you got into more of 
the mountainous type area.

17:35.237 --> 17:37.900
Can you tell me what a usual day was like for you? 
When I was with this armor unit, I was attached to

17:40.302 --> 17:46.129
the 173rd, as I mentioned before. We did various 
types of operations. They had what they called

17:50.432 --> 17:58.484
search and rescue, which you may find somebody 
might be trapped and you go in to help them get out.

17:58.504 --> 18:15.508
They had search and destroy, where you knew that 
they had either troops, supplies,

17:58.504 --> 18:15.508
people that were giving them intelligent 
information, and you would go out and you would

18:15.961 --> 18:45.580
destroy whatever the situation was uh we did a lot 
of uh i guess it's kind of like being uh in the police

18:15.961 --> 18:45.580
department tell you just visible you know you're 
out there and it interrupts you know there if they

18:15.961 --> 18:45.580
if all of a sudden they see you here and you're over 
there then they can't really make their plans so

18:15.961 --> 18:45.580
you're kind of constantly on the move uh during the 
daytime uh most of the uh the actual combat type

18:46.471 --> 18:59.044
stuff for us took place at night, usually from 
about 9 o'clock at night to 3 o'clock in the

18:46.471 --> 18:59.044
morning, which are real high critical hours. And 
we would, in our night location, we would pull our

19:00.086 --> 19:12.118
tanks in, kind of like covered wagon style, and 
with the front slopes of the tanks at the outside

19:00.086 --> 19:12.118
and the main guns that way. You would have infantry 
people between the tanks. and then you had your

19:15.884 --> 19:18.266
backs to the inside of the circle. How big was the 
circle? The circle, of course, sometimes depends

19:24.492 --> 19:27.936
on how many tanks you had too. It was hard to keep 
your tanks repaired. You were issued five most of

19:31.900 --> 19:45.773
the time, probably had an average of three because 
you were always having to get something fixed on

19:31.900 --> 19:45.773
one and you'd have to take back to a base camp and a 
part would have to be flown in. So you always had

19:46.293 --> 19:48.416
something that was broken.

19:53.682 --> 20:10.123
But let's say if I had five tanks, then probably 
you're looking at a perimeter or

19:53.682 --> 20:10.123
probably would encompass about

20:15.757 --> 20:22.448
60, 80 yards in a circle type, you know, pretty big 
area. And that'd probably be the diameter, you

20:23.550 --> 20:26.014
know. And the infantry between them were dug in? 
Right, they would dig in at night between each of

20:29.199 --> 20:34.969
the tanks, you know. A normal rifle company of the 
Say, like, 173rd calls for, I believe it's 156 men

20:39.432 --> 20:48.885
as a full complement of filling every position. 
They, too, usually operate on a whole lot less,

20:49.726 --> 20:59.299
probably an average of about 85 people, which is 
what they call a standard company, which was about

20:49.726 --> 20:59.299
half staffed. And most of the times you probably 
wouldn't have 85 in the origin? I mean, 85 is

21:04.566 --> 21:06.088
probably an average. You know, 75 to 85 would be 
what you're going to be playing with. So what was

21:10.702 --> 21:12.004
the action like? Well, at night, and it's kind of 
funny, on this first particular day that I've been

21:13.346 --> 21:28.631
assigned to the 173rd, infantry people, straight 
leg infantry types, are real nervous. You can kind

21:28.651 --> 21:33.679
of imagine a cat in a room full of rocking chairs 
with about a 10-foot tail on them. That's about

21:33.699 --> 21:35.562
what they act like, and They're real jumpy and all 
that kind of stuff. And tanks, these tanks weigh 52

21:38.786 --> 21:42.650
tons apiece. They make noise. There's no way you 
can hide one. You drive around. People hear you.

21:48.958 --> 21:51.481
And infantry people are kind of like cats. They're 
real quiet. They don't make a lot of noise. And when

21:54.465 --> 22:00.672
we were with them, they didn't really know what to 
quite think of us. because we made so much noise.

22:03.289 --> 22:21.889
Well, the first night that we were with them, tanks 
have, of course, in 1968,

22:03.289 --> 22:21.889
we were just kind of getting into solid state type 
electronics, but some of the radios still had a lot

22:03.289 --> 22:21.889
of tubes in them, and they took a lot of a drain on the 
batteries. Well, we had a lot of batteries, but we

22:22.349 --> 22:25.773
had to charge the batteries up. The only way we 
could do that was to start the tanks at night. Okay.

22:30.183 --> 22:51.187
I started these tanks up about, you know, 
midnight, and the company commander of the 173rd

22:30.183 --> 22:51.187
came over to me and just went crazy, you know, I've 
compromised our location, you know, he's getting

22:30.183 --> 22:51.187
rid of us tomorrow, he don't want anything to do 
with us, you know, without crazy or what, you know,

22:30.183 --> 22:51.187
giving away our location, that kind of routine. 
And he said, I don't want you guys, I'm getting rid

22:52.429 --> 22:55.452
of you tomorrow. I said, well, that's fine, 
there's always, you know, somebody else to play

22:55.472 --> 22:58.536
with, you know. uh well they just weren't used to us 
and uh i think that's probably uh common to a lot of

22:59.292 --> 23:24.186
situations you know what you don't understand you 
kind of a little leery of and and uh it just so

22:59.292 --> 23:24.186
happened though that the next morning uh uh not 
saying all the fighting takes place at night but

22:59.292 --> 23:24.186
most of it does because They don't like to just run 
up against American firepower because it's just

23:24.706 --> 23:30.253
devastating. They couldn't beat it. That's 
right, and they're not stupid. So you just

23:34.919 --> 23:39.685
wouldn't want to just go up there and just get your 
teeth kicked in just because you didn't have

23:34.919 --> 23:39.685
anything else to do. So they used things to their 
advantage, too, and mainly that was darkness. But

23:44.451 --> 23:54.544
we had a way out for that, too, because all the tanks 
had what they called xenon searchlights on them,

23:44.451 --> 23:54.544
and they had... 200 million candle power, which 
is, you turn one of those things up at midnight, and

23:55.216 --> 24:03.047
it's just like 12 noon in a day. It's just daytime. 
But it had the same infrared capability, so you

24:06.973 --> 24:21.814
could do it at night, and you could see at night with 
infrared without giving away your location,

24:06.973 --> 24:21.814
unless they had infrared detectors, which they 
had those too. But anyway, it just so happened that

24:23.077 --> 24:31.708
the next day we got in a little firefight the next 
day while we were still with the infantry people.

24:32.730 --> 24:40.380
And, you know, if we catch troops in vegetation, 
our standard round was what they call a fleshette

24:32.730 --> 24:40.380
round. And it is just so devastating. They're like 
little steel arrows, about an inch long. And it'll

24:48.010 --> 24:52.476
clear a path about... 80 meters deep and about 200 
meters wide. If you catch somebody out, they can't

24:56.523 --> 24:58.387
get away from it. They're just caught and blown 
away. They're just caught. They're blown away.

25:02.195 --> 25:02.836
You cannot. It's just devastating. You could just 
clear that path out. I mean, you just clear it out.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.089
You catch them out in the open, they're just dead 
ducks. You may find... They had another round

25:13.111 --> 25:16.695
called a canister round, which is the same thing. 
It's kind of like, if you can imagine, a bunch of

25:16.735 --> 25:25.025
steel rods that are just packed down about 18 
inches and then sliced up like little beanie

25:16.735 --> 25:25.025
weenie type of deals. You know, a big weenie sliced 
up like a big little weenie, about as thick as your

25:25.065 --> 25:29.150
little finger. And those things, you could be in 
real thick vegetation, you could pop one of those,

25:29.530 --> 25:35.077
and you used to have instant daylight. I mean, it's 
just, it's just so powerful. But anyway, we got in

25:40.803 --> 25:42.325
this firefight, And we leaped on top of those guys, 
you know, in just one way. And then the infantry

25:47.945 --> 25:53.753
company commander thought, well, that's maybe 
not so bad, you know. Let those suckers go out and

25:53.773 --> 25:55.736
get them, you know. We'll just have them back and 
look. And, of course, we weren't, you know, it was

25:56.817 --> 26:00.402
not really any big deal to us. So, anyway, they 
decided they, you know, would keep us. They'd hang

26:04.949 --> 26:06.551
around a little bit, you know. And after a while, I 
remember... One time, my troops, the armor

26:11.937 --> 26:19.347
people, have to be supported. They have to have 
fuel. They have to have diesel fuel. They have to

26:23.713 --> 26:26.497
have ammunition. They have to have parts. We might 
have to pull an engine out in the middle of the

26:29.301 --> 26:32.486
jungle somewhere. They had kind of like a big 
wrecker called a VTR, like a big wrecker on tracks

26:33.026 --> 26:40.577
with a great big boom on it, and we'd pull 
transmissions. We pulled engines, fixed them in

26:40.912 --> 26:47.700
the field, you know, which makes you vulnerable 
while you're doing that. But sometimes that

26:48.161 --> 26:52.846
happens, and you have to go and make do. But anyway, 
after I'd been there for about, oh, I guess a couple

26:52.866 --> 27:08.185
weeks, well, actually after about a week, I 
figured out that, you know, whoever you're

26:52.866 --> 27:08.185
attached to in the Army, the rule is, that if I'm 
attached to you, then you have to provide support

27:08.587 --> 27:12.971
for me. But I could see after just a few days that the 
173rd was just not equipped to support a tank

27:14.953 --> 27:24.383
platoon. And so I just started having to provide my 
own support. Well, in doing that, I thought, well,

27:27.827 --> 27:35.194
I'll just go ahead and take care of them, too, 
because we all used the same weapons. I could order

27:35.314 --> 27:38.037
the ammunition, everything special that they 
had. that I couldn't get for them was like 81

27:38.371 --> 27:43.336
millimeter mortar ammunition. But all the rest of 
it I could get for them. But I remember we were up in a

27:46.539 --> 27:55.467
valley called the 506 Valley, which just had to be a 
road number on a map. And we were sitting up on top of

27:55.567 --> 27:58.530
this hill. And I had gone ahead and ordered food, an 
evening meal. Normally, we got... in armor, we

28:08.358 --> 28:11.361
would get one hot meal a day. Infantry guys, I know 
guys that had been there that never had a hot meal

28:13.564 --> 28:17.688
the whole time they were there. They were lucky to 
even have food. They ate from these cans? Yeah,

28:21.132 --> 28:27.859
they'd have C-rations or what they call LERP 
rations, which were dehydrated type food, and

28:21.132 --> 28:27.859
you'd add a little water. How'd y'all get hot 
meals? Okay. This particular incident, I had

28:32.284 --> 28:36.508
called in and said, I want food for 200 people, I 
mean 100 people. They brought it out on a little

28:42.145 --> 28:50.616
deal called a 5-4-A, which is like a pickup on 
tracks, wheels and tracks. Anyway, this little

28:50.796 --> 28:57.304
deal is coming across the ground out there. Of 
course, my platoon, we're just like a bunch of old

29:01.210 --> 29:03.112
hogs, you know. The guy set up all the food. I'm 
talking about roast beef, mashed potatoes,

29:05.053 --> 29:15.643
gravy, jello with lettuce, you know, and cold milk 
and chocolate pudding. And these guys, these

29:15.663 --> 29:23.069
infantry guys sitting over there watching all 
this stuff, or my guys, leap down on top of it like

29:15.663 --> 29:23.069
they're used to. You know, one waits for the other, 
got real good manners, like one hog waits for

29:23.109 --> 29:27.073
another. And so... And I just grabbed my plate, and 
that's, you know, after my guys got theirs. And

29:34.288 --> 29:45.342
finally, I thought I had mentioned it to the 
company commander that I was going to order food

29:34.288 --> 29:45.342
for, but I guess I forgot to because he came over to 
me and asked the lieutenant, he said, looks like

29:34.288 --> 29:45.342
you have a little bit left there. You think some of 
my people could get a bite of that? I said, oh, yeah,

29:47.805 --> 29:49.427
I'm sorry, I forgot. I must not have told you. I 
said, I'll order food for you guys, too. I said,

29:52.732 --> 29:54.574
yeah, you can line the suckers up, you know. And so I 
did, which is the first hot meal most of those guys

29:55.455 --> 29:59.280
have ever had. since they had been in country. And 
how were y'all able to get those males in? Well, we

30:05.708 --> 30:25.437
had a forward fire base, what's called a fire base, 
that was set up in a place close to what's called LZ

30:05.708 --> 30:25.437
English, which is just north between Da Nang and 
Cameron Bay, kind of halfway in the middle there.

30:27.003 --> 30:37.276
And it was just a place where they resupplied those 
people and where you could work on your tanks if you

30:27.003 --> 30:37.276
needed to. There's a lot of administration that 
goes on in any type of military unit. So that was

30:43.864 --> 30:45.946
kind of the forward base camp. But anyway, those 
guys, after they got that hot meal, You know, they

30:53.429 --> 30:59.497
thought that they kind of liked us after that for a 
while, you know. And most of those guys, I wish I had

30:59.798 --> 31:07.008
my pictures because I could show you and talk at the 
same time. But most of those guys, I mean, there's

31:07.669 --> 31:11.414
no fat on them at all. They're sleek because all 
they do is walk and not eat very well, you know, and

31:11.474 --> 31:17.382
sweat a lot. But anyway, I kind of fattened them up 
there a little bit. But anyway, I started carrying

31:21.104 --> 31:22.706
it. Their normal rucksacks probably weigh 
anywhere from 55 to 80 pounds that they strap on

31:23.467 --> 31:31.476
their backs. And they probably hike an average of 
15 clicks a day, 15 kilometers a day, which is about

31:31.496 --> 31:38.385
11 miles. And all they do is walk around out there. 
So I started humping their rucks for them and

31:44.472 --> 31:51.060
carrying their mortars for them. getting their 
food, their ammunition, their mail, everything I

31:51.344 --> 31:55.850
was getting for them. And they, after a while, you 
know, they just really didn't like us. You know,

32:00.456 --> 32:06.465
because then I really kind of spoiled them because 
I just started carrying them. They'd just hop on

32:07.526 --> 32:09.649
the back of the tank. Yeah, the tanks looked like a 
bunch of Sooners from Oklahoma heading to

32:09.669 --> 32:16.238
California back during the Depression. And it was 
almost comical what we looked like, I'm sure, to

32:16.927 --> 32:21.633
other people, but beats walking. And they kind of 
thought it did, too. While y'all were moving, were

32:25.678 --> 32:29.162
y'all with those people in your tank? Was it 
snipers by each other? Oh, yeah, you'd have stuff

32:31.104 --> 32:32.606
like that. Usually, you kind of knew what to expect 
most of the time. You know because you'd have

32:43.083 --> 33:12.364
intelligence reports that you know the bad guys 
over here in this area you go find them go get them

32:43.083 --> 33:12.364
you know, and you just kind of just hunt them down 
like a covey of quail and You know just track them

32:43.083 --> 33:12.364
down and get rid of them and We did some joint 
operations with the Vietnamese National Police

32:43.083 --> 33:12.364
We did some joint operations with with other 
Vietnamese armored units and and areas all over

33:12.884 --> 33:17.590
the coastal area.

33:20.353 --> 33:41.338
After I, after I'd been with them for a couple 
months, MACV, which was the Military Assistance

33:20.353 --> 33:41.338
Command Vietnam, which was the political arm of 
the Army, started levying all the USRV units,

33:20.353 --> 33:41.338
which is the United States Army regular units, 
United States Army Vietnam, which was the

33:42.905 --> 33:52.600
American fighting units, they started sending 
out orders to those guys saying, we want you to send

33:42.905 --> 33:52.600
us captains, lieutenants, and E7s. And they 
formed 350 of what they called mobile advisory

33:53.402 --> 33:59.351
teams. And some genius had finally decided that if 
they were going to win this deal, there was going to

34:00.232 --> 34:08.946
have to be one at the grassroots level or at the 
little village level. The Vietnamese army had

34:09.601 --> 34:13.968
just a horrendous AWOL rate. And they decided to 
quit fighting. They left and they went home for a

34:16.732 --> 34:18.995
while, you know. They weren't disciplined. Well, 
it's not that they weren't disciplined. It's just

34:22.420 --> 34:25.124
they've already been doing this 20 years, you 
know. So if you're going to save your family,

34:25.505 --> 34:28.349
you've got to just take off every once in a while. 
So, I mean, you never knew what you were going to be

34:29.231 --> 34:35.179
left with with those people. And that was kind of a 
bad thing for Americans to do. adapt to because

34:39.301 --> 34:45.529
you're used to thinking, well, I've got so much, 
and this is what I'm going to deal with. You find out

34:45.549 --> 34:47.411
you don't have that. So I got, in order to be chosen 
for one of these mobile advisory teams, you had to

34:49.714 --> 35:06.996
have had at least four months in country, and you 
had to have at least four months left in country. so

35:07.364 --> 35:09.327
they could get a little mileage out of you. So they 
didn't want to just take the green troops and throw

35:09.888 --> 35:16.338
them into a deal that would probably be 
disastrous. And then they didn't, you know, if

35:16.979 --> 35:23.168
you're going to be leaving next week, it wouldn't 
be a good idea either, you know. So they formed 350

35:23.188 --> 35:33.264
of these mobile advisory teams, and they sent us to 
a school down in Zeon, which is just outside of

35:23.188 --> 35:33.264
Saigon. And we had... to get completely retrained 
on all new weapons, which was M1 rifles, M1 and M2

35:35.984 --> 35:49.682
carbines, 60mm mortars, and BARs, which was 
Browning Automatic Rifles. All these weapons

35:50.242 --> 35:53.587
were all leftovers from World War II. And that's 
what we had given the South Vietnamese to use,

35:54.908 --> 36:03.840
where a standard American would have an M16 as his 
rifle. So y'all were using this all the time?

36:05.988 --> 36:06.409
Right. Well, it's not that I still use the M16, but, 
and of course I supplied my own self, took care of

36:06.689 --> 36:15.781
all my own supplies. And, but, but the Vietnamese 
units had the old equipment, you know, 30 caliber

36:16.722 --> 36:25.693
machine gun. Of course, in our infinite wisdom of 
our government and so many things that they did

36:28.016 --> 36:34.965
over there, it's just one stupid blunder after 
another. they give a Vietnamese soldier an M1

36:35.671 --> 36:54.541
rifle that weighs 9 1⁄2 pounds, and if he's got it 
sitting on the ground, the butt of the rifle on the

36:35.671 --> 36:54.541
ground, it hits him somewhere between his chin and 
his ear. So it'd be kind of like somebody giving

36:55.523 --> 37:02.995
your eye a flagpole and say, you know, This is your 
weapon. Well, it's too long and it's too big, you

37:05.207 --> 37:10.632
know, and it just about pulls them over. Time to get 
it up. It weighs so much, you know, it's hard for

37:11.773 --> 37:14.756
them to use. But they liked the little M1, M2 
carbines, but they were in such poor condition,

37:15.237 --> 37:27.488
you could sit there and shake them and the bolt 
would fall out, which is a receiving bolt, you

37:15.237 --> 37:27.488
know, which seats the bullet when it goes in and 
out. It was just a terrible deal. But the idea

37:31.763 --> 37:46.696
behind the mobile advisory team was to go out and 
round up all the males in the villages where these

37:31.763 --> 37:46.696
people lived, and equip them, and train them, and 
then go out on operations with them. So they gave

37:46.716 --> 37:55.184
us, we had 35 hours, 35 classroom hours of 
Vietnamese language. And they said, now go train

37:57.065 --> 38:00.268
an army.

38:02.965 --> 38:11.234
Now, that's a real

38:02.965 --> 38:11.234
hopeful situation, you know. And in my particular 
situation, they sent us up to a little town called

38:12.536 --> 38:26.391
Bami Tut, which is about 10 miles this side of 
Cambodia.

38:27.653 --> 38:34.942
This particular town was the capital of all the 
Montagnard people, which are kind of like Indians

38:27.653 --> 38:34.942
in the United States. They don't speak 
Vietnamese. And you're trained in Vietnamese?

38:39.047 --> 38:39.287
Yeah. Well, you had half Vietnamese and half 
Montagnards. Well, you know, the French had been

38:43.993 --> 38:48.398
over there for 20 years, and some of them spoke a 
little French. And, you know, you can't help but

38:48.479 --> 38:53.745
live someplace with no few words, and so some of 
them spoke a little Vietnamese. And of course, the

38:54.451 --> 38:58.956
Americans had been there for a while, so some of 
them knew a little English. And so I actually

38:58.976 --> 39:05.362
bought a French book, a little paperback French 
book. And with that and a little English and a

39:06.283 --> 39:10.187
little Vietnamese. And the particular people I 
was around was a tribe that spoke what they called

39:10.988 --> 39:17.775
Rade Montagnard. It's kind of like Apache or 
Navajo or something like that. So I got this guy to

39:24.387 --> 39:32.637
teach me, write down a bunch of words that I felt 
like I needed and how to speak those words. And so I

39:33.558 --> 39:36.842
just memorized all those words in Rite A. So with a 
little bit of Rite A, a little bit of French, a

39:36.862 --> 39:45.914
little bit of English, and a little bit of 
Vietnamese, we could communicate that and draw

39:36.862 --> 39:45.914
lots of pictures in the dirt. So language there is a 
big factor. Big factor. Of course, here you got

39:52.720 --> 39:54.944
America. Again, they give me an interpreter, 
right? Now, how do we as Americans, you know, if we

39:58.349 --> 40:05.200
want to find out if you know anything, what do we do? 
We stick a pencil in their hand and we give them a

40:06.041 --> 40:10.188
test, right? You know what we do? Well, my little 
interpreter, you know, that's real good. He could

40:17.440 --> 40:19.403
translate on paper, dog. you know, in English to 
dog in Vietnamese, and get them, you know, back and

40:19.653 --> 40:25.804
forth, but he couldn't speak. He couldn't speak it 
at all? Very little. So, and he used to get me in a lot

40:29.029 --> 40:39.568
of trouble, because, of course, you know, I would 
say things, and he would kind of think he

40:29.029 --> 40:39.568
understood what I was saying, and he would say 
things, because I'm a village chief, You know, and

40:39.548 --> 40:44.593
boy, I could tell Vilshi all of a sudden, like he's 
insulted, you know. And I said, you know, come on. I

40:46.715 --> 40:47.956
said, what did you tell him? You know, I told him, I 
said, no, that's not right. That's not what I

40:50.919 --> 40:51.840
meant. You know, so he had some real communication 
problems. Yeah, it was bad. But this was, but what

40:59.387 --> 41:09.117
we would do is we would teach these people infantry 
tactics, which is ground, you know, type tactics.

41:09.603 --> 41:11.845
tactics, and then we'd go out on operations with 
them. I had five regional force companies and ten

41:12.986 --> 41:28.861
regional, what they call popular force platoons, 
which is just kind of rounded up everybody in a

41:12.986 --> 41:28.861
small village, and they call them a popular force 
platoon. So I had ten of those little platoons and

41:29.262 --> 41:31.404
five companies. The companies usually would 
guard a stationary object like a bridge or radio

41:32.004 --> 41:39.171
station, electric power generating station, you 
know, something like that. They would have a

41:45.399 --> 41:47.462
mission to do something. The little popular force 
type guys, they were just kind of supposed to

41:48.303 --> 42:08.247
defend themselves, be intelligence gathering 
people out there for us, but yet they would go in

41:48.303 --> 42:08.247
operations with us too. Sometimes we'd have a 
joint operation, we'd pull in a bunch of platoon, a

42:08.497 --> 42:14.526
couple companies, and you'd go out and do your 
thing that day. Tell me a little bit about the

42:15.949 --> 42:20.496
action that you were involved in with the 
infantry. Okay. Kind of like describe the scenery

42:21.237 --> 42:24.802
and how you... I was up in an area in what they call a 
two-corps. Vietnam was broken down into four

42:28.688 --> 42:31.313
different corps. There was I-Corps, which that 
was mainly... The Marines were up north. 2 Corps

42:35.889 --> 42:41.296
was kind of a mountainous type region. 3 Corps was 
kind of between the mountainous up to about

42:41.316 --> 42:47.242
Saigon. And 4 Corps was kind of all of the Delta area 
where it was all rivers and all that kind of stuff.

42:54.010 --> 42:55.592
Lots of water, lots of rice paddies. There's rice 
paddies all over the country, but I'm talking

42:55.612 --> 43:01.319
about just all rice paddies, you know. Just all 
water. I wasn't down south, I was kind of in the

43:02.885 --> 43:12.178
north to north central portion of Vietnam, mostly 
mountain type terrain, lots of vegetation.

43:14.502 --> 43:30.124
There was a lot of coffee, tea, rubber 
plantations, lots of bananas, pineapples, that

43:14.502 --> 43:30.124
kind of plants growing around the area, even on a 
commercial basis. One of the really frustrating

43:31.235 --> 43:53.957
things for, I guess, everyone that was over there, 
kind of standing order was that if you got shot at

43:31.235 --> 43:53.957
from a coffee-tear rubber plantation, you were 
not allowed to shoot back into these plantations

43:31.235 --> 43:53.957
because you were liable to damage a plant, you 
know. And it takes three years to grow a tea bush to

43:54.958 --> 43:59.402
maturity, you know, And so apparently our 
government felt like that the three-year-old T.

44:00.125 --> 44:12.797
Bush was a whole lot more valuable than some 19, 
20-year-old kid, which was kind of frustrating if

44:00.125 --> 44:12.797
it was you, you know. What did y'all do? You just 
couldn't fire back? You just had to sit there while

44:18.702 --> 44:21.124
they fired at you? Yeah, or leave, you know. That 
was usually like in daytime operations. There

44:28.111 --> 44:29.592
again... I thought one of the more civilized 
things that I found when I was in Vietnam was that

44:30.685 --> 44:43.003
basically from about one o'clock in the afternoon 
to about three or four, it would just kind of cease

44:30.685 --> 44:43.003
fire. I mean, it just kind of, you know, take a 
siesta, let's call this thing off for a while,

44:43.083 --> 44:51.074
everybody kings eggs, and nothing ever happened. 
Yeah, everybody just says, let's just rest up for

44:52.596 --> 44:59.967
tonight, you know, or, you know, you've done your 
thing for the morning, well, hit it again tonight,

44:52.596 --> 44:59.967
and, you know, have a little lunch, and, You know, 
just kind of rest for a while. So it was kind of

45:03.228 --> 45:07.313
weird, some of the things that went on over there. 
You

45:07.373 --> 45:19.386
had asked earlier about what it felt like about the 
first time that somebody had shot at you and that

45:07.373 --> 45:19.386
kind of atmosphere. I was kind of, I guess, 
probably like everybody else. You don't know how

45:22.369 --> 45:23.730
you're going to react. You know, can I shoot that 
guy? I don't even know him, you know.

45:29.309 --> 45:30.311
You kind of have those thoughts. You think about 
that before, but the first time somebody shot at

45:30.932 --> 45:42.351
me, there was no doubt in my mind that I could pull 
the trigger and did. It's just automatic. Oh,

45:42.792 --> 45:44.936
yeah, it's just automatic. You know, when you're 
sitting here in the United States, it's real fine

45:45.056 --> 45:55.013
to have some real high ideals and, of course, 
conscientious objectors, Back in the mid-60s, it

45:55.280 --> 45:58.886
was kind of a big deal. The press gave it a lot of 
notoriety and that kind of stuff. It was my

46:02.652 --> 46:20.320
experience, without exception, every 
conscientious objector that I ever met, most of

46:02.652 --> 46:20.320
whom were talked into by their recruiter, said, 
well, you don't want to carry a weapon. No, I

46:20.360 --> 46:22.063
wouldn't want to kill anybody in it. So their 
recruiters would say, well, then you're saying

46:22.432 --> 46:26.036
you would like to help people. Is that what you're 
trying to say? Oh, yeah. Then you'd like maybe some

46:28.019 --> 46:29.541
medical field. Would that be good? They'd say, 
well, yeah, that'd probably be fine. And so they

46:33.525 --> 46:35.508
would make them combat medics. Well, little did 
they know what the combat medic does. It isn't a

46:42.136 --> 46:43.137
hospital. It isn't a mass unit. You're out there 
with the infantry. And when you have these nice,

46:47.903 --> 46:52.388
fine ideas, in the United States, it's awful easy 
to stand on a soapbox and spout them off. But when

46:57.175 --> 47:10.157
that other side doesn't know about your fine 
ideas, and you don't have the protective aspects

46:57.175 --> 47:10.157
of the continental United States, and you're a 
congressman, and you're a senator at the right

46:57.175 --> 47:10.157
home if something doesn't please you, I mean, 
that'd kill you. And all of a sudden, you

47:11.620 --> 47:18.291
understand the real world as opposed to the more 
idyllic world of liberty.
