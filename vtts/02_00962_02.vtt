Continuing the interview with Mr. Bruce Barber, 
who's in Vietnam. We're discussing the effect of

00:05.271 --> 00:11.462
the anti-war feelings within the military. 
Continue, please. Well, as I said, I wasn't aware

00:14.107 --> 00:23.625
of any anti-war feelings either in the Air Force or 
I don't recall hearing any in the other services.

00:25.207 --> 00:28.011
That's just not the nature of the service. That's 
like asking Aggies to root for Texas or something.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.024
It wasn't there. Maybe I didn't see it. Maybe it was 
there at some levels, but I wasn't aware of it. What

00:42.996 --> 00:47.343
were your thoughts or feelings when Saigon did 
fall in 1975? Well, I thought it was sad. All those

00:50.875 --> 00:57.766
people died, all that money, all that effort, and 
it was for nothing, really. We tried to set up a

00:58.848 --> 01:02.634
democratic government in South Vietnam. We 
failed.

01:07.802 --> 01:14.352
The United States effort had to be pulled out 
primarily because of lack of support. from the

01:14.804 --> 01:20.772
American people and thence the government, 
senators, congress. We tried to Vietnamize the

01:22.074 --> 01:35.212
war by saying, okay, we're not going to send our 
people over here anymore to get killed, but we're

01:22.074 --> 01:35.212
going to give you all the stuff you need to fight 
this war. And then we're going to gradually go back

01:35.872 --> 01:40.639
home and you can fight them. Well, that didn't 
work. The Vietnamese didn't have the will to win.

01:44.487 --> 01:47.170
They didn't, you know, the South Vietnamese 
didn't. The North Vietnamese did. They cared a lot

01:48.471 --> 01:59.462
more and they were, you know, well-disciplined, 
motivated and in the end they just, you know, they

01:48.471 --> 01:59.462
took over the place. Did you see the war perhaps as 
more of a civil war between South? I mean, we pretty

02:06.109 --> 02:10.714
much created South Vietnam as an entity, but Did 
you think it was more an internal struggle or was it

02:11.200 --> 02:15.488
more communism taking over? I think it was 
communism taking over.

02:26.267 --> 02:27.690
The North Vietnamese communistic government, 
they wanted the South. They got it. They made a mess

02:33.622 --> 02:35.964
out of it and didn't do anything with it. I didn't 
see it as a civil war. Maybe part of it was that.

02:44.652 --> 02:57.323
That's kind of a broad question, but do you think 
the Vietnam experiences, I mean obviously it's

02:44.652 --> 02:57.323
changed American foreign policy, but how would 
you see it as being detrimental to the policy in

02:44.652 --> 02:57.323
general or I mean, do you think that now that 
Reagan's eight years as president has kind of

02:57.640 --> 03:07.272
brought us back to a pre-Vietnam sense of policy? 
Well, I don't think so. I don't think it's brought

03:09.615 --> 03:12.979
us back to that point at all. Maybe we've gone back 
some distance. But this country doesn't operate

03:16.304 --> 03:21.009
like it did 30 years ago. If it did with a trouble 
spot like Lebanon and so forth, And what happened

03:26.665 --> 03:33.214
over there, we'd have sent the troops in there and 
taken that place over and straightened that

03:26.665 --> 03:33.214
country out 30 years ago. When the Iranians took 
over our embassy, we'd have gone in there and

03:34.316 --> 03:40.665
straightened that place out. But we just don't do 
that anymore. It's more a diplomatic approach. We

03:47.054 --> 03:54.765
don't have the big military stick out there waving 
it around all the time. and we're a lot less

03:55.184 --> 04:02.271
involved in other countries' business than we 
were. There were some things that the CIA did in

04:02.352 --> 04:18.408
Vietnam and so forth in that time period that 
become public knowledge that has changed the way

04:02.352 --> 04:18.408
we do business a lot. Would you draw a comparison 
between what's going on in Central America with

04:23.281 --> 04:24.022
Vietnam. And then another thing is kind of 
Reagan's approach to Vietnam was the fact that,

04:24.783 --> 04:33.135
you know, you mentioned Congress didn't let us 
win. You were held back. Do you think that that's, I

04:35.097 --> 04:38.983
mean, as far as like specifically in Central 
America? Well, yeah, there's another example

04:40.064 --> 04:50.338
where, you know, that's a far more direct threat to 
the United States than South Vietnam ever was, or

04:40.064 --> 04:50.338
Korea. And here we've got... you know, a war and 
communist

04:53.099 --> 05:04.795
forces that I think pose a real threat to our 
security in the future. I think those rascals will

05:05.676 --> 05:21.638
keep right on coming, and Mexico certainly is in 
bad shape to try and fend off any kind of

05:05.676 --> 05:21.638
internal struggle that they might get involved 
with. I think that years ago, we'd have been right

05:22.343 --> 05:27.950
in the middle of that Nicaragua business. But 
we're not going that way today. The public won't

05:32.636 --> 05:34.219
support it. The Congress won't support it. We just 
got to try and work out a political answer. And that

05:40.727 --> 05:46.615
may work and it may not. Just one last question. I 
mean as far as, what did you do when you were in

05:49.428 --> 05:53.494
Korea? Were you a fighter pilot there? I was right 
out of flight school, or right out of flying

05:55.156 --> 06:01.144
training of course, and I was mostly an air crew. I 
was also, well we flew missions similar to those in

06:02.826 --> 06:19.249
Vietnam, but I was also an instructor, an 
instrument flying instructor, and I flew people

06:02.826 --> 06:19.249
in the training planes a lot, teaching them 
instruments. You always have to have a certain

06:23.474 --> 06:36.974
amount of instruments flying every year, 
wherever you are, and that kind of occupied a lot of

06:23.474 --> 06:36.974
my time, but I didn't do any

06:23.474 --> 06:36.974
staff work or anything at that time. I was too 
young, really. Could you, as far as the effort in

06:40.199 --> 06:47.650
Korea, I mean, comparable to Vietnam, What would 
you tend to say about people that said, well,

06:48.406 --> 06:57.380
Korea, we just went in there and we did it right, and 
that's the way we should have done it in Vietnam, to

06:48.406 --> 06:57.380
this extent? Well, Korea

06:59.644 --> 07:10.320
is different terrain, a different type of 
warfare, really. We weren't fighting primarily

07:11.041 --> 07:13.305
guerrillas. We were fighting regular forces. and 
I think the South Koreans were more motivated than

07:16.452 --> 07:22.721
the South Vietnamese. We did get back to the 38th 
parallel and established the kind of government

07:24.303 --> 07:35.018
we wanted, so it was a win in a sense. I

07:36.439 --> 07:44.130
think we're actually losing control over there 
and we'll be back on the opposite side of the fence

07:44.887 --> 07:52.457
pretty soon, but it was a different situation 
really. Okay, well I guess that's all the

07:52.477 --> 07:58.345
questions I have unless you have any questions or 
anything you'd like to say? I don't have anything

07:58.645 --> 08:00.047
else. Scott, I think we covered about everything, 
all the questions.

08:07.887 --> 08:17.277
I hope what I have said is some kind of meaningful 
and that you can make some kind of report after

08:07.887 --> 08:17.277
this. Okay, well, thanks a lot. Okay, you're 
welcome.

46:51.372 --> 46:53.141
Hello, what are you doing?

46:56.499 --> 46:58.328
Are you running out?
