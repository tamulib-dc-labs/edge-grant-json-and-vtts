00:01.921 --> 00:06.749
In the 50s and 60s, who were some of the leaders of College Station?

00:07.530 --> 00:12.959
Well, the mayor was Ernest Langford, head of architecture department.

00:14.462 --> 00:23.777
And there was, on the school board there was Bonnen and

00:27.352 --> 00:36.064
Lancaster's were community leaders, the Schlesemans, Dr. Linnert.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.513
There's another veterinarian that lives across the street from him.

00:52.367 --> 00:54.490
I just can't call their names now, Haskell.

00:55.280 --> 01:07.956
As far as I am aware, that almost every person in a community leadership role, school board, city, and so forth, almost every one of them were employed on the campus.

01:08.517 --> 01:09.238
Just about 100%.

01:11.000 --> 01:11.641
Just about 100%.

01:11.681 --> 01:19.832
Because all of the community, everybody, all your neighbors and everything were faculty members employed on the campus.

01:21.294 --> 01:22.435
Now, of course,

01:27.123 --> 01:27.523
Fred?

01:30.247 --> 01:30.667
Bryson?

01:31.188 --> 01:32.630
No.

01:33.110 --> 01:34.172
Landscape Architecture.

01:34.792 --> 01:36.514
He's the one who planted all the trees on the campus.

01:36.535 --> 01:37.676
Oh, yep, yep, yep.

01:37.696 --> 01:37.996
Henson.

01:38.517 --> 01:39.358
Henson.

01:39.378 --> 01:40.319
Fred Henson.

01:40.419 --> 01:41.340
Fred Henson.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.822
Because he predates Bob Rucker.

01:43.423 --> 01:44.384
Yeah.

01:44.765 --> 01:46.947
In campus landscape.

01:46.987 --> 01:50.852
The trees were quite small when we got on the campus, but the people who were

01:51.423 --> 02:00.185
on the campus, Wilcote, who was in foreign language, he was prominent, just everybody on campus.

02:00.726 --> 02:07.322
They kind of took your rank off of campus, you know, off of campus, into the community.

02:07.555 --> 02:10.218
because they had the higher the rank, the more money.

02:12.601 --> 02:15.544
All right, let's head toward concluding this.

02:18.668 --> 02:26.037
Do you remember any special highlight moments for you other than a child graduating or something like that?

02:26.958 --> 02:31.183
Any special events in your Aggie memory?

02:32.244 --> 02:36.769
The fondest one of all is one that you've been through.

02:38.572 --> 02:38.892
Ah.

02:40.154 --> 02:41.696
And what year did you win that watch?

02:41.716 --> 02:42.096
1970.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.380
That's the achievement award.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.641
Did you have any warning?

02:47.182 --> 02:47.422
None.

02:49.645 --> 02:54.991
And what was your reaction?

02:55.551 --> 02:59.035
You just kind of catch your breath and beat yourself to see if it's you.

03:00.057 --> 03:06.604
I tell people that that was such a pleasant, pleasant surprise in front of your friends and colleagues

03:07.225 --> 03:30.448
and now uh they send them a letter and have then a called meeting for and there's almost nobody attends yeah it's not nearly as much fun as it everybody was there and have your name called and you know you beat yourself to make sure you're not dreaming right right because uh one of my colleagues had told me at the msc

03:30.901 --> 03:34.065
Before then, he said, you know, one of these years, you go win one of those.

03:34.686 --> 03:37.849
And I said, yeah, I'll kiss your fanny when they give one of those to me.

03:38.570 --> 03:43.877
And up on the stage later, when I got the award, he said, well, are you ready to kiss my fanny now in public?

03:45.238 --> 03:51.246
I tell you, Haskell, from all I've heard about you, and I've heard quite a bit, it's all been very, very complimentary.

03:51.266 --> 03:51.927
Well, thank you.

03:51.967 --> 03:52.367
Thank you.

03:53.729 --> 03:54.149
Let's see.

03:56.933 --> 03:58.114
Got two more questions to go.

03:58.174 --> 04:00.537
Let's make believe somebody gave you

04:01.124 --> 04:04.609
a million dollars with this restriction.

04:05.770 --> 04:06.912
Here's a million dollars.

04:06.952 --> 04:12.880
You pass it on to A&M for whatever purpose you would like it to be used for.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.042
What would that purpose be?

04:15.704 --> 04:16.565
I believe scholarships.

04:17.807 --> 04:19.029
In what areas?

04:21.292 --> 04:22.353
I would kind of divide it up.

04:22.994 --> 04:25.798
Of course, I would make our department one of the recipients.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.847
And our college was one of the recipients.

04:28.428 --> 04:38.158
But I think in general to you, but I really believe in helping, you know, youngsters get through college.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.560
I really believe in that.

04:40.501 --> 04:41.902
All right, then the last question.

04:43.364 --> 04:49.891
What did it mean to you in your life that you got that telephone call from Mr. Dowell?

04:51.012 --> 04:51.773
From Mr. Penberthy?

04:52.494 --> 04:54.216
Penberthy to come down here.

04:54.938 --> 04:57.561
It's changed our life a thousand percent.

04:59.904 --> 05:00.945
Life's entirely different.

05:00.965 --> 05:03.668
If I'd stayed in Kansas City, we'd have had an entirely different life.

05:06.772 --> 05:12.098
Now, we Presbyterians believe in predestination, that it was somebody had it planned.

05:12.178 --> 05:13.720
Does it look that way to you?

05:15.622 --> 05:17.084
Well, you know, I think of this.

05:17.164 --> 05:23.832
I think how well the Lord has taken care of me and my family, our family, and the things that...

05:26.900 --> 05:33.005
It looks like you kind of, sometimes I feel maybe I have a guardian angel, you know.

05:33.025 --> 05:33.986
Somebody, do you believe in them?

05:34.006 --> 05:35.528
I have to say, no, I don't think so.

05:35.568 --> 05:38.911
But I kind of, down in my heart, I sort of believe in it.

05:39.071 --> 05:46.577
So yes, I kind of think, I don't think you're predestined to whether or not you're going to live a Christian life.

05:46.657 --> 05:47.638
I think that's a beauty.

05:47.658 --> 05:48.399
I agree with you there.

05:48.439 --> 05:48.839
Yeah.

05:48.859 --> 05:49.680
Yeah.

05:49.700 --> 05:53.704
But.

05:53.944 --> 05:54.684
Let's quit with that.

05:55.305 --> 05:55.405
Okay.
