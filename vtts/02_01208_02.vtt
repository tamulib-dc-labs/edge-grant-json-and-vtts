00:01.870 --> 00:14.649
For the TVMA, you know, but that was more, I 
interviewed you a little bit for the TVMA, so I

00:01.870 --> 00:14.649
thought I'd just like to get a little resume of your 
life, talking about you, you know, not

00:01.870 --> 00:14.649
necessarily TVMA. Why don't you give a little 
resume of your career? You were born right in this

00:20.978 --> 00:22.981
area, weren't you? Oh, actually I was born in 
Austin, Texas. What was your birthday? July the

00:29.140 --> 00:31.403
27th, 1915.

00:34.106 --> 00:37.190
Born in Austin, right almost in the shadow of the 
Capitol. When we went to school, we'd go across

00:38.792 --> 00:51.808
town and I spent an hour running through the 
rotundas of the Austin Capitol and visiting

00:38.792 --> 00:51.808
during the legislative session, all that kind of 
stuff. And see, my father was a printer. He came

00:57.254 --> 01:07.665
from just the other side of De Leon, out in that true 
mid-central Texas. Very few people know about De

01:07.685 --> 01:15.073
Leon and Eastland and Sisko and through that 
country. But my father was printing a newspaper by

01:15.954 --> 01:21.680
the time he was 12 years old. My grandfather 
traveled for a silver moon candy company. And

01:27.342 --> 01:35.270
every time he'd get into some smaller town, a 
little time to spare, he'd buy their scrap type at

01:27.342 --> 01:35.270
the printing office. Just did paper bags, you 
know. It took them a lot of time before they'd get

01:36.771 --> 01:46.981
around and they'd have to sort it, put it back in its 
proper places so the typesetter handled it almost

01:36.771 --> 01:46.981
like a typewriter. He had a big case type thing and 
he could feel A, B, C, Ds, E, F, Gs. He could just grab

01:55.449 --> 01:56.590
them and and fill his plate by hand-spelling with 
those linotype-prepared lead figures. Well, a

02:12.310 --> 02:17.936
very long story short, Father came to Austin with 
the Austin American States newspaper. And he was

02:19.137 --> 02:21.800
picked up by Mr. Sticks, Edgar Sticks. Steck was 
kind of an entrepreneur, and one of his desires was

02:24.565 --> 02:32.754
he'd like to help print a bit. And so he and my father 
together founded the Steck Print Company in

02:32.774 --> 02:37.939
Austin. And of course, Steck is known statewide 
for preparing most of the checks that go to the

02:37.959 --> 02:47.088
banks and insurance policies. And back during the 
centennial year of Texas, they published for the

02:47.429 --> 02:53.475
first time. manuscripts, copied manuscripts. 
Today they're known as Steck Vaughn. Vaughn was

03:01.154 --> 03:07.179
pretty big in the publishing business and he took 
over and it's still in existence. But my

03:07.199 --> 03:18.849
father-in-office, Steck Printing Company, was 
right downtown and we would visit him and maybe

03:07.199 --> 03:18.849
ride with him home and so forth while I was in Austin 
schools. And just before I went to A&M, My family

03:24.472 --> 03:30.781
moved over on the south side of Austin in what's 
called Travis Park. And there was a Mr. Norwood.

03:34.526 --> 03:37.831
Had quite an estate over beyond this. The 
expressway now runs almost through his property.

03:44.741 --> 03:49.127
That forms into the expressway through Austin and 
so on. Now, I worked for him during the summers.

03:53.294 --> 03:55.717
looking after his swimming pool. A lifeguard, 
pool manager, and so forth. He had a private pool.

04:01.285 --> 04:08.636
And he got in trouble with income tax people, and he 
lost everything except his homestead. And he had

04:08.656 --> 04:10.539
to open his pool to the public. So while I was 
babysitting this pool, there was a story in the

04:12.041 --> 04:22.035
newspaper about Mark Francis, dean of the 
veterinary school in Texas A&M. I took that paper

04:22.994 --> 04:27.179
home and told my parents, I'm going to be a 
veterinarian. That's the first ink that I ever

04:27.199 --> 04:30.684
had, and that's how I got started. And the 
following fall, I went to A&M, 1933,

04:32.266 --> 04:46.104
in September, and graduated in 1937, June. And 
almost had the same inspiration, I decided just

04:47.466 --> 04:52.512
out of the clear blue that I liked New Belfast, and 
so within a few hours' time of the state board, I was

04:53.099 --> 05:05.975
in New Belfast, Texas, in practice, still in June 
of 1937. You know, at the time you began practice,

05:06.235 --> 05:14.425
did they still inflate udders for milk fever and 
that sort of thing? Well, right off the verge, the

05:16.467 --> 05:22.735
quackery is what we called it back at that stage. of 
inflate the udder. But that did help. It seemed to

05:27.432 --> 05:30.357
have some effect. The difficulty was the methods 
they were using. They used everything from

05:34.384 --> 05:37.148
bicycle pumps all the way through. It was 
unsanitary. They would seal it by tying it with

05:38.250 --> 05:46.904
just most any kind of boundary twine or anything. 
But didn't didn't licensed veterinarians do that

05:46.964 --> 05:50.089
also? Well, yes. You know, there was a very, very 
narrow line at that time in the minds of young

05:52.960 --> 06:09.495
veterinary students, which is still close to 
today, that that old licensed practitioner was

05:52.960 --> 06:09.495
just a step above the quacks. And there wasn't a 
great deal of respect out for the older

06:10.356 --> 06:18.523
practitioner because these new faggots

06:21.558 --> 06:35.277
drugs and the drug development, that is, you know, 
the first advent of the detail man who would come

06:21.558 --> 06:35.277
around and explain the products and so forth. 
Veterinarians owe a lot of their education in that

06:35.538 --> 06:41.406
period of time to the detail people. who went back 
to the home office, you know, and came back with how

06:42.314 --> 06:48.881
they manufactured ship and how they manufactured 
backgrounds. You know, give you a more of a

06:49.562 --> 06:56.609
practical insight on what you were working with, 
see. In the classroom and all, you knew the basic

06:56.710 --> 07:11.005
principles and so forth, but you didn't know much 
about the research that went behind it or the

06:56.710 --> 07:11.005
difficulties it had with it or those type of 
things. There was quite a transition. I was

07:14.939 --> 07:16.201
fortunate. I came out in 37, like I say, it was 
tough, lean years, still even in New Brunswick.

07:23.695 --> 07:31.370
See, the Depression hit the Southwest and Texas 
much later than it did up the country. You know, you

07:31.390 --> 07:33.634
hear them talk about the 30s. Well, the Depression 
didn't come down this way until pretty late in the

07:34.643 --> 07:42.111
30s, and then it was very short-lived. But I was...

07:42.131 --> 08:03.756
Before I had that difficult transition, coming to 
a German community, I had to remember to get

07:42.131 --> 08:03.756
specific directions, and I had to be careful 
because they'd start off talking in German and

07:42.131 --> 08:03.756
calling me, and I'd have to... you know, attempt to 
interpret, but try to get them over to English and

08:04.563 --> 08:12.932
get those proper directions working from there. 
And then, of course, I was called, again, somewhat

08:12.952 --> 08:22.102
like referred back to the various methods. A lot of 
so-called ranchers and so forth at that time had

08:22.122 --> 08:33.675
had a little bit of A&M, and either it failed or and 
decided to come on home and practice. And so they

08:39.909 --> 08:45.256
had a little smattering of animal health. There 
was a period in there that we were a little debated a

08:45.296 --> 08:55.170
lot about how much you teach the layman versus how 
much you teach the student. And so when I came, a lot

08:56.211 --> 09:00.557
of those calls were by Oh, I'd call them just trial 
run. They just wanted to see if I knew anything. I

09:06.418 --> 09:11.545
had some pretty good rounds with the individuals 
who were just tested. One example, which is rather

09:14.149 --> 09:23.061
absurd, the one guy called me out, a couple of sick 
mules, or one sick mule. Yeah, a couple of mules.

09:24.743 --> 09:26.325
One sick mule, I said to him, Took me down to the pit 
and said, there they are. And I said, well, which

09:29.741 --> 09:31.103
one are you seeking? He said, I don't know. That's 
what I called you for. So I decided real quick, I

09:34.648 --> 09:38.293
said, okay, here's my symbology. Go take the 
temperature. Well, then we hit it off. We got along

09:41.577 --> 09:42.679
all right. But those little type things. But back 
to the subject matter principle, things were

09:47.966 --> 09:56.177
pretty tough, but I had an offer and a chance to go 
back to Vanderbilt University on a degree, or a

09:57.490 --> 10:04.596
short course, or a seminar, or whatever you would 
call them in old days. I'm a sanitary engineer. And

10:09.601 --> 10:13.324
the state health department had indicated that 
they would like to have me. And they sent me to

10:14.605 --> 10:17.308
Vanderbilt University. I came back and joined the 
State Department of Health in the division of

10:18.509 --> 10:23.353
group. Was this a short course, or was this a... 
Well, they were six months. a six-month period of

10:27.308 --> 10:31.212
which we studied concrete stress. In those days, 
everybody was held down, putting pit privies out

10:31.393 --> 10:39.802
for everybody, upgrading from the old open toilet 
to open pit. Just a big step. It was part of

10:43.366 --> 10:51.275
Roosevelt's program of rural upgrading and so 
forth. Very fascinating. It gave me quite an

10:54.158 --> 10:56.100
exposure to a cross-section of individuals and 
another slant at a different type university,

10:56.890 --> 11:06.419
different surroundings. One of my old 
classmates, for example, graduated with me. He

11:11.203 --> 11:16.488
was a practitioner in Nashville, Tennessee, and 
he took me out of his way. He was a much older person.

11:19.411 --> 11:23.995
I'd say he was in his late 30s before he finished 
A&M. And his father was, well, his name was White.

11:29.275 --> 11:35.402
His father had invented and developed numerous 
veterinary instruments. The White Instrument

11:35.422 --> 11:40.949
Company and then the White Serum Company. But, 
yeah, I went through that period, came back, had a

11:40.969 --> 11:51.221
boss that was a real stickler. Anytime I hear now 
about Stadium plays, not earning their salters,

11:54.265 --> 11:59.793
all that kind of stuff. I can look back and I was on 
the road many times up to six weeks without coming

12:00.174 --> 12:14.915
home because I would file an itinerary with the 
boss before I left Austin. And I would meet that

12:15.195 --> 12:22.045
itinerary almost like you would a agenda. You'd be 
at a certain place at a certain time, and you'd do a

12:23.088 --> 12:26.872
certain job. And in those days, to start out, food 
and drug was running down the old empirical

12:26.892 --> 12:39.848
products that were available in the drugstores.

12:39.868 --> 12:47.917
Even chasing my old alleged veterinarian who had, 
oh, what did he call himself? He had a medicine show

12:48.117 --> 12:50.580
out of Waco. had a monstrous replica of a, what's 
the word I want to use, a petrified log, and a little

12:51.792 --> 13:07.553
museum in it, and then he'd put on a big pitch at 
nighttime. And we recorded him, and used that

13:07.794 --> 13:20.010
recorded spiel as part of his advertising 
program, and finally got a conviction on him.

13:20.834 --> 13:26.222
Those type things were the beginning of Food and 
Drug Administration. That will graduate on up

13:26.242 --> 13:37.158
into the passage of the state milk inspection law. 
We went out and went from town to town and would sell

13:38.720 --> 13:48.394
the standard milk ordinance provided by the U.S. 
Public Health Service. to set some standards and

13:48.863 --> 13:53.869
milk supplies within the communities. Started 
out with the advent of the little dairy barn and the

13:53.929 --> 14:04.560
cleanliness program and the upgrading in general 
all the way up to TB testing. And a very fascinating

14:05.822 --> 14:09.065
period of time. Many experiences there where you 
just felt like you were beating your head against

14:09.526 --> 14:14.391
the wall. I had one down in Oh, I think they call it 
Baytown now. It used to be Goose Creek.

14:26.512 --> 14:28.293
Very fascinating period of time. Many 
experiences there where you just felt like you

14:28.453 --> 14:33.258
were beating your head against the wall. I had one 
down in, oh, I think they call it Baytown now. It

14:37.763 --> 14:40.425
used to be Goose Creek, Baytown, and Pillay. There 
were three little communities outside of

14:41.466 --> 14:43.889
Houston. And they operated a creamery. It was 
owned and operated by the Galveston Houston

14:46.998 --> 14:51.422
Brewing Company. And we had some complaints and 
squawks. And so I went into there, and it was

14:54.826 --> 14:59.350
terrible. The creamer was horrible, but the 
dairies were worse. And so I called Austin and got

15:04.835 --> 15:11.842
help, and we started inspecting dairies. And they 
finally wound up with a big session at the

15:11.862 --> 15:15.165
courthouse, And by that time, we had built a kind of 
a reliable spirit. And the city health officer

15:23.623 --> 15:29.651
took on, he took to it like a duck to water. And his 
pet project was a wash pan and a bar of soap in the

15:29.771 --> 15:41.907
barn where they could wash their heads between 
milk and so forth. That was his pet. Ours was all up

15:43.394 --> 15:50.805
to stainless steel containers and separate 
utensil rooms and things of that nature. But

15:50.825 --> 15:52.628
anyhow, that long story short there. Now, this was 
all you were working for the State Department of

15:52.648 --> 15:55.733
Health.

16:01.842 --> 16:10.836
Well, the left was kind of mixed emotions because 
you couldn't tell by the response of the public

16:01.842 --> 16:10.836
here and all like that what would happen. But when 
we came back at the prescribed time, it was just

16:11.845 --> 16:19.913
almost miraculous what they had done. They'd 
often meet us out front, for example, and start

16:22.215 --> 16:32.425
cheering on us, pushing all the money you cost me 
and all that damn stuff. Then they'd take you

16:32.445 --> 16:39.071
around back and have a whole brand new barn, 
followed your little plan, everything perfect.

16:39.872 --> 16:41.734
And it gave us the inspiration then to go on and get 
on to the creamer. And we filed injunctions and

16:44.311 --> 16:50.118
everything and got to the creamer and got it all 
cleaned too. But this was the early beginning of

16:50.138 --> 16:55.744
the milk inspection. And I had the opportunity to 
grow up during that period. Then came the meat

17:00.710 --> 17:03.173
inspection. And I had the equal opportunity to 
grow up in that. Meat inspection came much slower

17:08.399 --> 17:11.923
and much harder because they had already 
established some forms of federal meat

17:12.629 --> 17:25.582
inspection, such as Armour and Swift in 
Dallas-Fort Worth, Swift and Company in San

17:12.629 --> 17:25.582
Antonio. They had begun to build plants under 
federal regulation, but state had no regulations

17:26.183 --> 17:33.531
at that time. And we had the typical situation in 
that with the little old or maybe an eight by eight

17:39.882 --> 17:47.469
amortor, they called it, or butcher pit, or 
slaughterhouse, or whatever it was called. And we

17:47.489 --> 17:49.832
grew up with that. And that's when we began to use 
more muscle than we had with milk inspection. Milk

17:56.198 --> 17:59.301
inspection was primarily educational. When we 
got into meat inspection, it was a question of, we

17:59.321 --> 18:09.130
were coming in late, the federal had already set 
the basis, and so we started out by enforcement. uh

18:09.700 --> 18:38.205
contamination uh food exposed to uh what was the 
word there was a basic principle in there that

18:09.700 --> 18:38.205
covered everything like grab all apple pies 
exposure of food to film that's it and we filed

18:09.700 --> 18:38.205
charges and we met lots of jps we learned how to show 
him how to fill out the What do you call them? Yeah,

18:42.608 --> 18:44.691
they're the forms. You had to fill out the file 
charges. And we'd help him do all that. In many

18:49.255 --> 18:51.758
cases, he was pretty nervous. Because I was old 
Bill, or Jim, he knew personally. But it worked out

18:55.942 --> 18:59.826
into a beautiful setup. And of course, then after I 
left the State Health Department, In 1941 or

19:05.523 --> 19:14.654
thereabouts, I was given a Department of 
Assistant State Veteran. Very much the same

19:16.256 --> 19:20.601
duties except with Animal World. In South Texas, I 
had all of South Texas as my territory. Now today

19:25.707 --> 19:30.072
they're called Regional Veterinarians or 
something like that. But anyhow, we were subject

19:30.092 --> 19:35.158
to call any time on Hopefully, we didn't involve 
ourselves in general practice or the general

19:36.117 --> 19:46.251
practitioners, except in cases of so-called 
disease outbreaks. And we were allowed practice

19:47.172 --> 19:55.663
privileges at home, and that's one of the reasons I 
took it, because I wanted to get back home. I stayed

19:56.064 --> 19:58.347
here then all the time. Now, I lived here all the 
time, but I was gone. so much that in 1941 I came back

20:01.818 --> 20:04.702
here. I settled down and built a house up on a hill. 
Built a little clinic in the backyard and then

20:08.967 --> 20:13.833
spent a great deal of time on the road. Anthrax 
outbreaks down around Quero, sleeping sickness

20:15.495 --> 20:27.210
outbreaks around Eagle Pass, rabies outbreaks 
here and there in Corpus Christi. Just all types of

20:27.230 --> 20:30.694
those type things and I grew up into that. And I 
literally mean grow up, because you start out with

20:31.417 --> 20:37.511
very little experience. And then you build on it 
by, oh, I had some wonderful tutors going back to

20:37.531 --> 20:50.961
A&M with Dr. Hubert Schmidt, who was head of the 
experiment station. The old man taught me a lot of

20:52.325 --> 20:56.969
tricks of the philosophy of building history. 
There's a man we could have gotten a lot of course.

21:01.053 --> 21:04.456
He wrote the history, but we could have gotten a lot 
of oral interviews out of him. Oh, well. Because he

21:05.857 --> 21:07.499
died prematurely. Well, but he was stubborn. Much 
later in the game, I tried everywhere in the world

21:10.482 --> 21:13.925
to get his memoirs. But he had that streak in him 
that he had worked hard and developed it, and he was

21:14.746 --> 21:20.571
holding on to those papers. Now, what for, I don't 
know. Well, some of it was published. Oh, yeah, but

21:25.763 --> 21:29.707
not nearly the way it should have been published. 
But, yeah, long story short, that, again, is him.

21:33.892 --> 21:41.140
He helped me a lot because I had him on several of the 
problems I had. In other words, as a state

21:41.901 --> 21:47.948
representative of the state veterinarian's 
office, You could call upon and get assistance of a

21:49.008 --> 21:59.440
lot more people than you could probably just a 
general practitioner like Phil Smith at Big

21:49.008 --> 21:59.440
Spring. There's lots of experiences out of that 
man. I had a good one over at Navasota. Bob,

22:06.387 --> 22:10.972
I'll put his name in a few minutes. He worked for me 
later on. But anyhow, I rely a whole lot upon those

22:16.312 --> 22:41.728
old-timers and their approaches to the thing 
because actually when you get into those type

22:16.312 --> 22:41.728
outbreaks and so forth, they're not true medical 
problems oftentimes as much as they are just

22:16.312 --> 22:41.728
putting two and two together and trying to come up 
with an approach to What is very obvious, you can

22:42.502 --> 22:45.627
see pretty well. You worked into a political 
problem, too, sometimes. Sometimes, because a

22:48.251 --> 23:01.472
lot of the calls that you made were referred by a 
representative or a legislator or a governor or

22:48.251 --> 23:01.472
somebody to the state veterinarian's office. The 
Office of the State Veterinarian wasn't too easy

23:02.347 --> 23:10.557
to manage then because you didn't have any 
representatives on the board from the

23:02.347 --> 23:10.557
professions, right? Right, right, and very 
little info, or what would you call it,

23:10.817 --> 23:20.289
infrastructure relationship. It was, oh, I don't 
know, just something that kind of grew with no

23:20.509 --> 23:30.060
particular principal involved. I think, again, 
it sounded like bragging or whatnot but

23:32.283 --> 23:50.691
completing this assistant 41 period assistant 
state veterinarian there was a transition was

23:32.283 --> 23:50.691
obviously going to take place in the state 
veterinarian's office and Dr. T.O. Booth was the

23:51.232 --> 23:58.763
state veterinarian at the time and he was gearing 
up to go back into the military as a retreat 1942,

23:59.873 --> 24:01.034
43. And he even had a double hernia repair and 
everything, get ready to get back in, and they took

24:01.314 --> 24:09.082
him back in. But in the meantime, the groundwork 
was rolling, and a group of colleagues of mine got

24:09.723 --> 24:19.232
together in Austin. I wasn't even present. I 
didn't know what was going on, and they decided

24:20.173 --> 24:26.479
that ours should be the next state veterinary. And 
it reached the stage where they were also going to

24:29.455 --> 24:56.762
supplement my salary by entertaining to all the 
veterans of texas that they contributed of amount

24:29.455 --> 24:56.762
of x number of dollars or whatnot to the state led 
there because the salary at that time was 2760 a

24:29.455 --> 24:56.762
year plus expense but i agreed to go and give it a 
trial but i told them i did not want to die from

24:57.130 --> 25:02.075
because every time I put on a necktie, that would 
come from Dr. So-and-so and so-and-so. All I'd do

25:02.095 --> 25:03.496
is just go try. So I went to Fort Worth in 1943, a 
state-led name, and bless his heart, Dr. Leon

25:04.177 --> 25:19.972
Cloud was, by that time, serving as the interim

25:04.177 --> 25:19.972
awaiting somebody's appointment. And I was still 
basically involved as assistant to him. And I went

25:24.937 --> 25:25.618
up Knocked on his door, told him who I was, and he 
jumped up out of his chair and said, Al, I guess he

25:26.408 --> 25:33.217
came after this chair. I said, well, I guess that's 
what he did, but didn't they tell you? He said, they

25:37.002 --> 25:38.865
didn't tell me a damn thing. So there I was, a bad 
bunch of my senior, and here I was just kidding. So

25:46.395 --> 25:51.522
we had a long heart-to-heart session that he had 
worked for the state for a number of years. at the

25:52.413 --> 25:55.476
fabulous salary of $166.66 a month. And so I told 
him that with me coming in, I was going to try it, I

25:55.576 --> 26:08.910
was green as grass, and I would prefer to just start 
and stop. And so I would recommend that he look for

26:09.751 --> 26:14.096
something to do. Or I was going to fire him. Well, 
boy, he got all bristled up and hostile and stormed

26:16.758 --> 26:21.103
out of there. About a week later, he called me in, a 
guy named Steinlein. The veterinarian had a

26:26.065 --> 26:30.441
lutealosis testing laboratory, one of the first. 
Howdy. Good evening. How are you? Quite good.
