WEBVTT

00:00.976 --> 00:02.438
...rings, only they don't ring. They don't ring. 
And so the result is, I'm always looking at my

00:03.220 --> 00:09.489
watch, looking to tape frantically, so we only end 
up taping 15 minutes it doesn't appear.

00:12.294 --> 00:18.043
Concerning deep ocean mining, are you optimistic 
or not optimistic about the ability to do this?

00:20.046 --> 00:23.551
Well, I think it would be a tremendous engineering 
feat if they can do it. I think, again, it's an

00:25.074 --> 00:28.519
economic question. the manganese nodules that 
they're chasing. I guess the big problem with that

00:34.387 --> 00:40.334
is they're waiting for the price of manganese to go 
up high enough. And then it'll become

00:41.135 --> 00:43.537
economically feasible.

00:50.325 --> 00:55.871
I'm sure there's a whole bunch of different things 
they can go out and try and scavenge up. And of

00:55.991 --> 00:58.354
course, it's environmental, I mean an economic 
question. Near shore resource recovery, you

01:03.317 --> 01:09.886
know, of course down in Texas you know about the 
oil. On the east coast they've been dredging up

01:11.528 --> 01:15.193
gravel for a long time.

01:18.056 --> 01:29.151
I'm not really up on that so I don't know what other 
kinds of things they can run around and harvest.

01:30.093 --> 01:35.359
It wasn't deep ocean mining, but of course the 
Germans were going to pay off the First World War

01:30.093 --> 01:35.359
debt with gold. I mean, there's a tremendous 
reservoir of material out there. And whether you

01:40.484 --> 01:47.532
can extract it or not, it's straight down to the 
bottom line. Do you make money at it or don't you

01:47.572 --> 01:50.435
make money at it? So I guess when other stocks or 
materials get expensive enough to try and get them

01:58.021 --> 02:04.207
out of the ocean.

02:04.227 --> 02:13.676
Now, I have a series of questions concerning 
undergraduate training, which ought to be...

02:14.417 --> 02:26.409
In terms of training for oceanography, do you 
think it's better to go and take a degree in the hard

02:14.417 --> 02:26.409
sciences and then come to oceanography late, or to 
go through a general undergraduate training in

02:14.417 --> 02:26.409
oceanography, or what? Well, this is a rhetorical 
problem we have in this department time and time

02:28.042 --> 02:36.411
again, because we're the only ones that have an 
undergraduate degree in oceanography. If you

02:37.131 --> 02:47.342
look at the players in the game, at least my age or 
older, or even some of them younger, we all came

02:37.131 --> 02:47.342
from another area and ended up in oceanography.

02:50.505 --> 02:53.188
I'm not really sure what kind of a approach to take. 
Again, I don't see any particular desirability to

02:56.268 --> 03:01.754
go one way or the other. I wouldn't want to see us get 
stamped into the mold of going one way or the other.

03:10.562 --> 03:21.994
I still think you've got to be,

03:10.562 --> 03:21.994
you've got to have the depth in one area, and then 
hopefully broaden your sight somewhat. it gets

03:22.396 --> 03:34.587
extremely difficult talking to people with just 
the broad brush view on things, because you always

03:22.396 --> 03:34.587
end up talking about the nitty-gritty somewhere 
along the line, and then you lose them. So I think

03:35.728 --> 03:51.542
we'll see recruitment coming into the field the 
same way as it has in the past, and that is people

03:35.728 --> 03:51.542
coming out of a discipline in the regular, quote, 
sciences, and then playing in the ocean, using

03:51.843 --> 03:55.647
their expertise in the ocean. It's kind of 
interesting if you look at people, again, my age or

03:56.487 --> 04:04.835
older, which is, what, 39, I think. I think, by and 
large, most of them had something to do with the

04:05.035 --> 04:14.684
ocean before they became a scientist. They grew up 
on it, they sailed on it, they swam in it, or

04:14.705 --> 04:20.550
something like this, and some sort of a 
fascination that way got them into the field. I

04:24.032 --> 04:33.505
guess I can look back on my own, you know, how I got 
into the business was that I never thought they

04:24.032 --> 04:33.505
would pay people to do this kind of thing, you know. 
And it's, you know, a very fascinating and

04:33.526 --> 04:37.191
interesting area. And having come from a family 
that used to work for a living, I was rather

04:38.152 --> 04:47.205
surprised, you know, that you could in fact make a 
living doing this sort of thing. So I don't see any

04:51.344 --> 05:02.397
any real need to get very excited about whether we 
should do the recruitment the way most of us have

04:51.344 --> 05:02.397
come into it or whether you should do it through the 
undergraduate route. The only thing I'm afraid of

05:02.998 --> 05:10.546
is that our undergraduates don't have enough 
depth in any one discipline.

05:13.109 --> 05:17.014
And I hate like heck to see everybody come up that 
way. We've been a little bit lax here. We've been

05:19.098 --> 05:21.540
trying to find out what's happened to our 
graduates.

05:24.803 --> 05:37.594
I don't think it's, well, if you go through any 
scientific discipline, if you look at the guy's

05:24.803 --> 05:37.594
major as an undergraduate and find out where he 
ends up, very few of them really go on into graduate

05:24.803 --> 05:37.594
school and that thing. So the fact that we know that 
a lot of our undergraduates don't end up in

05:37.634 --> 05:47.642
oceanography shouldn't really be 
disappointing, because the other disciplines

05:37.634 --> 05:47.642
have the same track record but if you happen to well 
it goes back to when the person makes a decision on

05:48.314 --> 06:17.629
what he wants to be you know when he grows up if for 
some reason somebody can come into you know a 15 or

05:48.314 --> 06:17.629
16 year old kid says I'm going to be an 
oceanographer and if he really knows what being an

05:48.314 --> 06:17.629
oceanographer is and if that's really what he 
wants to do and maybe getting them here as an

06:18.672 --> 06:27.563
undergraduate and then prodding them to get his 
expertise in a certain area, that's probably OK.

06:28.043 --> 06:36.053
But for an ordinary run-of-the-mill kid, heck, 
most of them don't even know what they want to do

06:28.043 --> 06:36.053
when they get to graduate school. And so I'm not 
sure we're doing anybody a favor or a disservice by

06:36.353 --> 06:44.883
taking them on as undergraduates. But I still 
think. you need some depth in some area if you're

06:48.845 --> 06:52.891
going to be a practicing scientist. Probably, I'd 
hazard a guess, or I would like to think, that the

06:54.373 --> 07:17.687
people that come through here as undergraduates, 
if they go into whatever they go into, and if they

06:54.373 --> 07:17.687
ever get in a situation where they have to make 
decisions that affect us later on, at least they

06:54.373 --> 07:17.687
know more about what we're talking about. i.e., 
they go into government or something like this.

07:22.665 --> 07:37.929
And if they end up in some rather remotely 
connected field, then I think you'd look at their

07:22.665 --> 07:37.929
undergraduate training as a broadening 
experience, which I think is what... I think we'd

07:37.949 --> 07:40.573
like to see that come out of colleges. I don't think 
we're really running vocational schools. I hate

07:46.017 --> 07:54.908
like heck to think that we're just running 
training programs to train people for jobs. I'd

07:54.928 --> 08:05.981
like to take the more philosophical point of view 
that this is an age that kids are developing ideas.

08:07.363 --> 08:08.744
They're growing up.

08:12.149 --> 08:15.012
Well, like when I went away to college, I went away 
from home. was in an area where it was rather

08:15.903 --> 08:18.486
forgiving. We all make mistakes. And that's a time 
that I guess you've got to do them. Preferably, you

08:24.193 --> 08:27.057
can do them then and not have them count. And so the 
philosophy behind an undergraduate program is

08:27.697 --> 08:38.611
something that we haven't really talked about in 
this department. Like I said, we are the only ones

08:39.011 --> 08:45.319
in the United States, I think, with a 
degree-granting program in oceanography on the

08:39.011 --> 08:45.319
undergraduate level. but I don't think we've ever 
seriously tried to track down all our graduates

08:46.987 --> 08:54.274
and see what happens to them. I have the feeling 
that we end up graduating a very small percentage

08:55.696 --> 09:16.437
of the entering freshmen, but that's sort of a 
trick in how they count credits in this university

08:55.696 --> 09:16.437
here, because it turns out that many of the 
biologically oriented people that come through

08:55.696 --> 09:16.437
as undergraduates end up with either joint 
degrees in zoology and oceanography, or if they

09:17.024 --> 09:26.714
missed the requirement along the way, it turns out 
that they don't have to do anything and they get a

09:17.024 --> 09:26.714
degree in zoology. So then they fall out of our 
statistics the way we keep them now. And probably

09:33.541 --> 09:37.866
the same thing happened in chemistry and probably 
physics, too. But again, I think to be a practicing

09:39.368 --> 09:44.533
player, in the oceanography game, I think you've 
got to have a depth in one area. Because

09:49.417 --> 09:58.046
oceanography is kind of a problem to really define 
it as a discipline. It's kind of an amorphous

09:58.106 --> 10:00.188
field. And we've seen an awful lot of people sort of 
trooping in. And they leave a few footprints, and

10:02.711 --> 10:06.194
they end up somewhere else. And they might even 
come back. So it's not such a rigid thing.

10:12.492 --> 10:13.714
discipline. Well, maybe the other fields are. I 
haven't had any experience with the other fields,

10:15.116 --> 10:23.126
but I don't think it's all that rigid of an area. 
Now, in that sense, what direction is

10:23.147 --> 10:26.451
oceanography going to go? What are the so-called 
hot fields in oceanography? I may use this word.

10:30.617 --> 10:38.447
You know, at one time, for example, nuclear 
engineering in oceanography was identified with

10:30.617 --> 10:38.447
each other in terms of career opportunities. What 
now? Okay, as far as career opportunities go,

10:42.142 --> 10:53.517
we don't have the real brightness that we thought 
we had a few years ago. We're probably a little bit

10:54.238 --> 10:57.663
brighter than as far as career opportunities. 
Broadly speaking, I think, well, perhaps one of

10:59.185 --> 11:09.499
the, at least in the biological area, one of the 
major areas that's going to expand over the next

11:10.947 --> 11:17.197
decade or so is predictability. And this has been 
prodded by the environmental problem.

11:25.569 --> 11:32.821
Well, the money to move down this avenue, I think, 
has been prodded by the environmental problem. If

11:32.841 --> 11:39.030
you go back and look at some of the older 
literature, of course, this is what they've been

11:32.841 --> 11:39.030
trying to do all along, predictability, the 
ordering of the knowledge, you know, both action

11:39.297 --> 11:46.107
wise and how can you predict what's going to 
happen. And again, in biology, that's probably

11:48.070 --> 11:50.714
the big area. But that's such a broad area. I mean, 
we can use it, again, to play the food for the hungry

11:54.179 --> 12:02.571
millions game.

12:04.660 --> 12:10.749
We can look at it from, you know, if you stress the 
system, what happens to the populations

12:04.660 --> 12:10.749
involved, i.e., these species? You know, does 
species A fall out? You know, who becomes

12:13.073 --> 12:14.255
dominant? There's a couple really big major 
questions in biological oceanography that

12:15.677 --> 12:20.825
haven't been answered. And quite frankly, I don't 
know how the heck you can answer them. And that's

12:24.230 --> 12:32.322
one of the things that sort of prods us is that

12:24.230 --> 12:32.322
we know that species composition changes by 
environmental perturbations, but we don't know

12:33.044 --> 12:40.619
if that really has any effect on productivity.

12:43.805 --> 12:56.048
If you want to sort of sidestep the whole issue,

12:43.805 --> 12:56.048
again, going back to this thing I was telling you 
about Heathrow Airport, we know that that there's

12:56.264 --> 12:58.387
codfish off Greenland. And if the average sea 
surface temperature drops a half a degree

12:58.407 --> 13:03.413
centigrade or a degree centigrade, they're going 
to disappear. Now, if you're a cod connoisseur,

13:04.635 --> 13:07.299
it's a disaster. But maybe you end up with a lot of 
sea urchins out there. So maybe the actual

13:09.862 --> 13:21.057
productivity won't change, just that we don't 
recognize the end product as a resource, unless

13:09.862 --> 13:21.057
you're a sea urchin connoisseur. So I think 
there's a lot of... large questions with

13:26.538 --> 13:44.118
ramifications of them that are questions that you 
can narrow down enough to work on and do an

13:26.538 --> 13:44.118
experiment, collect some data, play the 
hypothesis testing game to keep us busy for an

13:26.538 --> 13:44.118
awful long time. But I think the so-called hot 
areas are probably the predictability and the

13:44.439 --> 13:50.065
modeling aspect. Those are probably true for all 
the areas in oceanography, not just biology. I

13:54.736 --> 14:06.110
sort of get annoyed with computer simulation as an 
answer to everything, but I did buy one of those

13:54.736 --> 14:06.110
things, which is a tremendous little toy. And 
that's getting pretty close to it.

14:11.337 --> 14:23.292
The

14:11.337 --> 14:23.292
whole thing about science, I guess, is the 
predictability, the hierarchical ordering of

14:11.337 --> 14:23.292
knowledge. We're playing the game just like all 
the other areas. The other high-energy physics,

14:27.628 --> 14:40.783
for instance, I mean, they've

14:27.628 --> 14:40.783
gotten down to looking at such little tiny things 
that I personally don't find that very

14:27.628 --> 14:40.783
satisfying. I like to be able to hold my hand when 
I'm working with it. One of the nicer things about

14:47.410 --> 14:53.717
oceanography is that it's still a relatively 
young field You can sort of keep up with the

14:54.355 --> 14:57.198
literature. It's kind of a hassle. It takes a fair 
amount of my time, but as opposed to some of the

14:59.161 --> 15:09.813
other disciplines, I mean, boy, I would be pity to 
the kids getting into molecular biology and all

14:59.161 --> 15:09.813
that sort of stuff. Just the backlog of 
information these kids have to sieve through is

15:09.833 --> 15:15.240
just frightening. I try to keep a fair number of 
journals. Mainly if they don't pass my desk, I

15:19.685 --> 15:22.388
don't send them. But I used to read Biochem Med by 
Phys Acta. And back when I was a beginning graduate

15:26.331 --> 15:33.621
student, each year you had about 18, well, 20, 
maybe 28 inches on the shelf. Well, nowadays, the

15:34.282 --> 15:41.751
same journal, if you get the various series, 
there's probably three or four shelves. And I

15:42.292 --> 15:44.295
don't know how you keep up with that sort of stuff. 
But that's, maybe I'm lazy. I don't want to spend

15:48.280 --> 15:50.603
all my time reading it. The other thing about 
oceanography is that I think there's still some

15:51.359 --> 15:57.750
important discoveries to be made. The

15:57.790 --> 16:05.784
people at Woods Hole were kind of stuck up about 
this, and they said, oh, what the heck are you

15:57.790 --> 16:05.784
reading literature for? Because you're writing 
it. You don't have to read it. You should be the guy

16:07.928 --> 16:11.614
right up there in the front and writing it all. But 
who can predict breakthroughs are solutions to

16:16.688 --> 16:20.412
big problems or something like this. But I still 
think there's some reasonably large size

16:20.572 --> 16:30.122
problems that are definable right now in 
biological oceanography that are unanswered.

16:30.902 --> 16:46.358
And in that way it's kind of, I hate to use the word 
challenging, but I guess that's what I mean as

16:30.902 --> 16:46.358
opposed to some of the other disciplines where 
they keep poking and poking and poking and

16:30.902 --> 16:46.358
breakthroughs are totally unprotected. I mean, 
you're really flailing around in the dark trying

16:46.844 --> 16:53.733
to find that big thing that's going to propel you to 
the Nobel Prize. I don't think anybody in

16:54.194 --> 17:09.956
oceanography is ever going to have to worry about 
that one, but

16:54.194 --> 17:09.956
there are still some nice, fairly definable 
problems in oceanography to be worked on. For

17:09.976 --> 17:10.576
example? Well, the whole thing, what does species 
composition do it? honest-to-goodness

17:15.835 --> 17:17.677
production in an area. The interaction between 
energy flow and population dynamics on the

17:19.019 --> 17:24.545
species level. This one, the only thing that's 
discouraging about that area is that people have

17:26.608 --> 17:38.422
been hassling this thing for an awful long time, so 
somebody's got the right answer for the wrong

17:26.608 --> 17:38.422
reason and he doesn't know it. So maybe that 
wouldn't be as rewarding as, you know, stumbling

17:44.050 --> 17:47.173
onto something completely new. But

17:47.393 --> 17:57.362
as opposed to some of the other disciplines, of 
course, I mean that's a minor problem. Again, the

17:57.963 --> 18:06.871
other disciplines are so damn specialized now 
that

17:57.963 --> 18:06.871
I just pity the poor kids getting into it. But I 
think that's one of the big ones. Okay, the one

18:09.794 --> 18:12.336
we're playing around with right now is how to 
Organisms on the bottom of the ocean make a living.

18:16.763 --> 18:21.189
If you dredge up a clam that's a half inch in 
diameter, he might be 50 years old.

18:24.514 --> 18:42.120
Some of the other things that I'm constantly 
surprised at, and I've seen it time and time again,

18:24.514 --> 18:42.120
is you dredge up some of these fish from a couple 
thousand meters down, which most people have only

18:24.514 --> 18:42.120
seen pictures of, and they never read the scale on 
the bottom, and they're only this big. But they

18:42.438 --> 18:44.220
might be 50 years old, too. And how do organisms 
make a living out there? I think it's a

18:47.845 --> 18:54.513
major unanswered question. Again, going back to 
the food for the million, there is a genus,

18:56.676 --> 19:03.645
cyclotone, I think is the correct pronunciation 
of it. There's probably more of those things than

19:04.266 --> 19:09.913
anything else in the world, that species than any 
other fish species in the world. There must be

19:10.282 --> 19:12.986
billions and billions and billions of metric tons 
out there. The only trouble is there's only one per

19:13.006 --> 19:16.150
cubic meter, so you can't catch them. But that's 
probably the fish production in the ocean.

19:21.097 --> 19:25.923
There's probably more biomass tied up in that 
mid-water genus than everybody else. You

19:27.886 --> 19:28.888
probably can't catch them. Again, economically, 
it's not feasible to catch them. But again, every

19:33.614 --> 19:37.960
time I'm on a boat where they drag up one of those 
things, it's... I'm always impressed. Mainly

19:41.300 --> 19:48.349
because, I don't think I have the book here, but 
Marshall, I think, was the one who wrote it. No,

19:50.492 --> 19:51.914
Norman, History of Fishers. And he's got these 
nice color plates in there. They show these guys

19:54.337 --> 19:58.443
with these big teeth and the big eyes and all the 
four to fours and stuff like this. But they're only

19:58.463 --> 20:02.808
two inches long.

20:03.910 --> 20:06.213
You always have some pleasant surprises. And like 
I said, I've seen that, I can't Hundreds of times,

20:09.732 --> 20:12.555
but I'm still impressed with it every time I see it. 
What about declining fields of oceanography?

20:17.401 --> 20:19.164
Physical oceanography, for example. It seems 
like people don't work in physical oceanography

20:19.184 --> 20:24.010
anymore at the same rate they used to. Well, I think 
we've seen a major shift, and this is kind of a

20:25.411 --> 20:37.326
touchy point in this department because we have a 
large number of people that call themselves

20:25.411 --> 20:37.326
physical oceanographers. But they're really 
applied mathematicians. And we see an awful lot of

20:40.977 --> 20:50.146
numerical modeling trying to explain phenomena 
that go on in the ocean. My major gripe is that an

20:51.868 --> 20:58.634
awful lot of the practitioners of that particular 
kind of science don't go to sea. I don't think they

20:59.675 --> 21:06.182
know what, I don't think they really grasp what's 
going on out there. And again, they're in an area in

21:06.837 --> 21:21.951
theoretical physical oceanography, fluid 
hydrodynamics primarily, again, where they're

21:06.837 --> 21:21.951
beginning to get down to how many angels can stand 
on a head of the pen. It seems that they work the

21:22.372 --> 21:33.402
field over very well so that on the broad aspects, 
the parts that are mostly utilizable by anybody

21:34.495 --> 21:37.439
else, i.e. a merchant marine, the weather people, 
and things like this. A lot of these things are

21:39.642 --> 21:58.008
reasonably well known, and so now they're getting 
down to the real fine-grained nitty-gritty,

21:39.642 --> 21:58.008
which I'm sure must be interesting to them, 
otherwise they wouldn't do it, but its

21:39.642 --> 21:58.008
relationship to other areas in science is greatly 
diminished. So that we see a lot of emphasis on

22:02.288 --> 22:04.731
physical oceanography in this department. 
Probably half the faculty is what I would call

22:04.771 --> 22:15.704
physical oceanographers here, but very few of 
them go to sea.

22:15.984 --> 22:29.541
Most of them, not most of them, a fair number of them 
are looking at extremely small scale phenomena,

22:15.984 --> 22:29.541
which

22:15.984 --> 22:29.541
as a biological oceanographer doesn't do much for 
me. I'm still stuck with large-scale motions in

22:32.123 --> 22:36.469
the ocean. You know, worried about movements 
through the thermocline, the picnic line, things

22:38.412 --> 22:42.979
like this. But these people are worrying about 
even smaller-scale stuff than that, so that

22:42.999 --> 23:00.966
they're... Again, they don't have a heck of a lot to 
tell me about anything that I have a problem with,

22:42.999 --> 23:00.966
although I fully appreciate that most of the 
biological problems in coastal waters is driven

22:42.999 --> 23:00.966
by the physical processes. But again, what 
they're telling me or what they're working on

23:01.992 --> 23:06.378
doesn't help me with that at all. There are people 
who work with that, but it seems to be a minor

23:06.398 --> 23:18.193
concern of the physical oceanographers now as 
compared to, say, 10 or 15 years ago. Now, I have

23:19.895 --> 23:22.298
another question along that line, too, Robert. 
Roger Revell has suggested what's wrong with the

23:23.740 --> 23:26.664
modern oceanographers. He no longer gets his feet 
wet. Would you agree with that? Yep. Okay. Okay. He

23:32.215 --> 23:44.626
has also suggested that one of the problems with 
marine biologists is that with the advent of the

23:32.215 --> 23:44.626
computers and the vast amount of data coming in, 
that people don't have familiarity anymore with

23:32.215 --> 23:44.626
their data. All they have familiarity with are 
data sheets. Yeah, you see a lot of that too. And so

23:52.473 --> 23:57.878
then you think that perhaps, I don't want to use 
the, I don't, the question is not well worded. I

23:57.938 --> 24:00.720
don't mean that oceanography has become too 
sophisticated. but that possibly more field work

24:01.342 --> 24:08.049
should occur in oceanography. Yeah, I agree with 
that. One of my criteria is to accept the graduate

24:11.172 --> 24:14.936
student. He's got three things he or she has to be 
able to do. They have to be able to do things with

24:18.861 --> 24:20.362
their hands. They have to be able to do things with 
their heads. By God, they've got to be able to go to

24:23.125 --> 24:24.707
sea. I mean, if they don't go to sea, then I won't 
touch them. Okay, I go to sea, oh,

24:32.122 --> 24:46.024
let's see, next year I'm scheduled 70 days out of 
the year, and I went through a tabulation for

24:32.122 --> 24:46.024
somebody else a little while ago. Okay, I've been 
in the field for 13 years, two and a half years I was a

24:47.106 --> 24:58.163
bureaucrat in Washington, and in aggregate I've 
got something like 24 months at sea, which, um,

24:59.425 --> 25:08.562
Well, if you're a mariner, of course, that doesn't 
mean much, but compared to most of the people I talk

24:59.425 --> 25:08.562
to around here, that's an awful lot of time in the 
city. And anybody that I'm going through the

25:09.403 --> 25:16.897
educational process with, they're going to be 
field-oriented people. I've got some kids here,

25:16.937 --> 25:23.188
some graduate students, I guess they're not kids, 
They grew up the same way that I did. They were

25:25.347 --> 25:26.248
underwater. One of them happens to be a blue water 
sailboat racing type.

25:33.796 --> 25:35.698
But he's got a good head. He remembered things. And 
he's seen things. He's felt things out in the

25:37.941 --> 25:39.422
ocean. And he's got a lot of insight into some 
problems that people, again, we've got some

25:39.462 --> 25:48.492
biological oceanographers who never really have 
been to sea. And it's taken them 15 years to get to

25:48.512 --> 25:53.057
the same state of development as this kid is. Of 
course, he's been doing it for over 15 years too,

25:53.813 --> 25:58.438
but he hasn't been a professional in the business 
for 15 years. Here's a guy starting out. He'll

26:01.140 --> 26:02.642
probably finish up next winter. And he's probably 
got as much innate feel for what's going on in the

26:03.863 --> 26:18.538
ocean that he's learned what the technical jargon 
is so he can describe it since he's been a student.

26:19.126 --> 26:23.873
to match up to some of these 50-year-old people 
around here that have been in the business all

26:19.126 --> 26:23.873
their lives. I think a lot of oceanographers

26:25.095 --> 26:31.284
have real problems because they don't go to sea. 
They forget what's going out there. And they're,

26:35.270 --> 26:39.376
well, I can sit here. This happens to be one of my pet 
peeves, as you probably figured out. And I've seen

26:42.540 --> 26:47.007
people whose idea of a of the ocean is a matrix in a 
computer bank. And they keep interrogating this

26:51.914 --> 26:57.359
matrix that they've generated there. Sometimes 
they've even gotten some real data in to generate

26:58.801 --> 27:06.268
the matrix, but a lot of times they don't because 
the computers can't handle the real problems.

27:06.789 --> 27:07.910
They're just too complex. They're not fast 
enough. It costs too much money to model it.

27:15.590 --> 27:25.983
I really get annoyed at people who tell me about 
this or that, or they'll tell me that this

27:15.590 --> 27:25.983
measurement that I've done isn't really up to 
snuff. There are better ways of doing it. Yes, I

27:27.345 --> 27:30.309
know there are better ways of doing it, but you 
can't do them out there. The instrument doesn't

27:31.230 --> 27:34.454
work, let's say.

27:36.697 --> 27:45.208
And again, with the way the funding situation is 
going, unless you're extremely queued about

27:46.049 --> 27:49.093
things, it's pretty tough to get students out to 
sea. The government won't pay for it anymore.

27:52.477 --> 27:53.479
Well, that was my next question. What about ship 
time? One of the problems with oceanographers who

27:54.380 --> 28:02.711
want to go to sea, it seems to me, is a limited amount 
of ship time available to institutions. Well, I

28:02.731 --> 28:06.957
think, yeah, okay. You can flip this coin both 
ways. If you go and look at the proposals that they

28:11.322 --> 28:14.166
send in, and how much money they need to run the 
ships. It turns out that if we're going to run all

28:17.994 --> 28:22.241
our ships all year long, there's not enough money.

28:25.145 --> 28:30.194
But it might also be true that there's not enough 
worthwhile seagoing science to keep all the ships

28:25.145 --> 28:30.194
busy.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.883
We play this game every year. Well, of course, now I 
take a partisan point of view being here in

28:38.207 --> 28:41.993
Washington. in the University of Washington, but 
back when I was at NSF, we had a, we played the flip

28:42.445 --> 28:59.080
game, and the problem, well, one of the problems, 
one of the bureaucratic problems is that nobody

28:42.445 --> 28:59.080
has ever tried to figure out how much ship time was 
really required. We just know that we seem to be

29:00.501 --> 29:06.547
spending an inordinately large amount of money 
for ship time for the science that goes on the

29:00.501 --> 29:06.547
ships. Of course, you can rectify that by One of two 
ways, you can cut down the ship time bucks so you can

29:10.728 --> 29:17.574
put in more dollars into the science that goes on 
the ships. But in two and a half years at the Science

29:18.635 --> 29:31.687
Foundation, at least in the biological 
oceanography program, I don't think I've ever

29:18.635 --> 29:31.687
seen a worthwhile seagoing program that wasn't 
funded and given the ship time to do it. And so you

29:31.707 --> 29:39.874
always end up, you know, one of the rhetorical 
questions was, if you had more money in biological

29:31.707 --> 29:39.874
oceanography, what would happen? And the pan 
answer was you'd fund more incompetent

29:40.630 --> 29:46.759
scientists.
