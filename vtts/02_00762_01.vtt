WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:04.109
Yes, could you tell us your full name? My name is 
Bonnie Sue Shelton Stadelman.

00:11.889 --> 00:14.356
And could you tell us when and where you were born? I 
was born in Boulder, Colorado, June the 18th,

00:14.376 --> 00:18.968
1934.

00:30.558 --> 00:44.113
as far back as you can remember with grade school, 
if you wish, and bring it on up to the time that you

00:30.558 --> 00:44.113
acquired your Ph.D. Well, I attended elementary 
schools in Toledo, Ohio and Waterville, Ohio. I

00:46.015 --> 00:56.346
went to high school in Waterville, Ohio my first 
two years, then transferred to Maumee Valley

00:46.015 --> 00:56.346
Country Day School where I had a scholarship. From 
there, I went to Earlham College, which is a Quaker

00:57.052 --> 01:02.681
college in Richmond, Indiana, for two years. I 
transferred to Ohio State where I got a BS in 1956.

01:11.935 --> 01:16.522
Then I taught school for two years in Durham, 
Connecticut. Even though I had a bachelor's

01:16.562 --> 01:23.312
degree in social science, I taught biology and 
math. Then I got my master's degree at Western

01:25.216 --> 01:32.465
Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio in 1960. I 
expected that with a master's degree I'd be able to

01:32.645 --> 01:40.635
teach history, but the coaches still had that 
field all sewed up. So I ended up in Chalmette,

01:40.735 --> 01:48.064
Louisiana teaching biology and general science. 
Then I started to Tulane in fall of 1964, and I got my

01:52.925 --> 02:00.634
PhD in American Colonial History in August 1969. 
Then what did you do after you received your PhD?

02:05.761 --> 02:07.923
Well, I was already employed here on the staff. I 
see. I see. When and why did you come to A&M to teach?

02:15.312 --> 02:19.497
I was married at the time, and my husband was on the 
philosophy faculty. I see. And I sort of haunted

02:20.752 --> 02:23.595
Dr. Nance's office. And the Latin American 
historian, I believe his name was Dr. Ewan, or

02:24.456 --> 02:37.349
McEwan, had a heart attack and collapsed in his 
office. And so they needed somebody in the middle

02:37.369 --> 02:39.471
of the year. So I fit right in in January of 1968. I 
see. And what were your primary teaching

02:47.363 --> 02:51.707
responsibilities at this time? I've been a 
perpetual freshman teaching History 105 and 106

02:51.727 --> 03:03.899
exclusively except for one semester when David 
Morgan was on leave and I taught Colonial American

02:51.727 --> 03:03.899
History. And what was your normal teaching load 
during the whole year by semester? When I started

03:11.146 --> 03:15.750
it was 12 hours and then when Dean Maxwell came as 
the head of liberal arts. He shifted it to a nine

03:18.792 --> 03:21.455
hour load. I see. And what did you teach in the 
summer time? Did you teach one semester or two

03:24.039 --> 03:28.525
semesters in the summer? The first couple of 
summers I taught two courses, one term or the other

03:28.645 --> 03:34.833
in summer school. Then there were a couple of 
summers I didn't teach at all, by choice. And then

03:44.435 --> 03:53.731
Let's see, it must have been the summer of 1972 they 
gave me one course one summer term and one course

03:44.435 --> 03:53.731
the second summer term. Because I was at the bottom 
of the totem pole and was lucky to get any summer

03:53.751 --> 04:01.685
teaching at all. Then the last two summers I've 
taught two courses the first summer term. Now, at

04:09.173 --> 04:15.001
any time while you were here, was your work 
criticized in any way? No. No, I never was praised,

04:16.162 --> 04:19.968
but that was par for the course. Nobody else got 
praised either. But there were strong hints, of

04:22.691 --> 04:30.482
course, that faculty were expected to publish 
articles. But I published an article in the

04:31.463 --> 04:38.893
William & Mary Quarterly, which I felt was pretty 
good feather. When

04:39.278 --> 04:48.391
did you first learn that you would not be granted 
tenure? What was your first inclination that you

04:48.411 --> 04:53.718
were going to have problems with the tenure? It 
never crossed my mind that there would be any

04:54.679 --> 05:01.168
problem until April of 1972. I was on the verge of 
getting a divorce, and I wanted to tell Dr. Nance so

05:01.688 --> 05:09.376
that he wouldn't find it out by the grapevine or 
read it in the newspaper. And I was very

05:10.498 --> 05:16.184
overwrought emotionally, and I could hardly talk 
to him. And I told him about my personal affairs,

05:16.424 --> 05:29.839
and he chose that moment to unload the fact that not 
he, but some members of the department felt that

05:16.424 --> 05:29.839
people who only taught History 105 and 106 should 
not be given tenure. And I was in such a state that

05:33.742 --> 05:42.534
the import of what he was saying only began to 
penetrate. Well, let's get something clear right

05:43.656 --> 05:46.059
now. Do you have a choice in what you teach? No. 
Never? No, not at all. So that's kind of unusual to

05:52.008 --> 05:53.750
tell you about that. Well, it made it sound as if it 
was a diabolical plot on my part. to refuse to teach

05:59.317 --> 06:05.484
advanced courses when actually everybody wants 
to teach advanced courses. But you were never,

06:05.504 --> 06:10.329
never given the opportunity to, except for the one 
time when Dave Morgan was on leave. But there was a

06:11.110 --> 06:22.162
prevailing atmosphere that everything would 
come to those who waited patiently, that their

06:11.110 --> 06:22.162
turn would come, that you served your 
apprenticeship. Yes, I understand that. I see.

06:24.104 --> 06:27.187
Well, then after this, do you remember when this 
conference was? April, 72. Then after that, then

06:29.590 --> 06:31.552
what? Could you give us sort of a chronological 
breakdown of what was happening? Well, it was just

06:36.558 --> 06:38.660
a matter of waiting. But then in the fall, I got a 
letter saying that I had been made a member of the

06:38.681 --> 06:45.849
graduate faculty. So I considered that a very 
positive sign. I didn't think they would put

06:48.232 --> 06:51.776
someone on the graduate faculty that they were 
about to fire. And then, simultaneously with the

06:54.238 --> 06:58.163
meeting of the tenure and promotion committee 
which consisted of all the full professors in the

06:59.257 --> 07:29.112
department there was a curriculum committee that 
met and there were two people who were members of

06:59.257 --> 07:29.112
both committees one was dr nance and one was dr hall 
the curriculum committee at this time assigned me

06:59.257 --> 07:29.112
a graduate course cultural history from the 
beginning to 1865 history 625 And I was to work out a

07:29.277 --> 07:35.464
course outline, a bibliography.

07:37.968 --> 07:45.697
And I thought that this was a very positive sign 
because it would meet this requirement that I

07:37.968 --> 07:45.697
teach something besides History 105 and 106. I 
thought, as a matter of fact, they had purposely

07:45.977 --> 07:51.444
gone out of their way to cover that. So you felt 
probably very relieved at that time. Well, I

07:55.467 --> 08:00.572
interpreted it positively, but there was still 
considerable anxiety. I see. Because I knew that

08:02.314 --> 08:06.698
the committee had met, the Promotion and Tenure 
Committee met. It must have been early in December

08:07.519 --> 08:10.982
of 1972. Can you tell us who was on this committee? 
All the full professors, which, you want them by

08:15.246 --> 08:18.269
name? You might go ahead. All right. It would have 
been Dr. Nance, Claude Hall, Herb Lang, Haskell

08:24.526 --> 08:35.905
Monroe, Betty Underberger, Tom Miller, Alan 
Ashcraft, and Lloyd Taylor.

08:35.925 --> 08:36.866
Six of those voted. Dr. Nance and Haskell Monroe 
excused themselves.

08:43.657 --> 08:49.086
But the decision had been made, and I knew it had 
been made, but they were not telling. Nobody was

08:49.126 --> 08:50.989
telling. So I approached Dean Maxwell just on the 
verge of a Christmas vacation because I was going

08:52.235 --> 09:06.316
to attend the American Historical Association 
convention in New Orleans and I wanted to know so

08:52.235 --> 09:06.316
that I knew how seriously I had to pursue John 
Prospects. And the dean claimed that he didn't

09:07.358 --> 09:10.382
know what the decision was yet. I see. And he 
wouldn't tell me. So I went to the convention not

09:15.389 --> 09:17.112
knowing. Dr. Unterberger rode with me to New 
Orleans, and she would not reveal the decision.

09:29.560 --> 09:37.150
I placed you handicapped at a place where, well, 
the slave market may be dead, but at least there are

09:29.560 --> 09:37.150
some jobs available. Well, at least I could have 
made some effort. Yes, that's what's

09:39.232 --> 09:41.115
interesting. Well, go on. What happened after 
that? Well, I returned... not having very

09:47.062 --> 09:52.627
seriously pursued the job thing, because I really 
felt fairly confident. I thought I had done a good

09:52.647 --> 09:54.989
job at Texas A&M. But I needed to know, definitely. 
So the second day of the semester, the second

09:59.533 --> 10:11.123
semester, in January of 1973, I went to Dean 
Maxwell's office. I had an appointment. And I

10:12.445 --> 10:16.208
said, I want to know. told me that the decision was 
negative. And for about the next three months, I

10:20.967 --> 10:26.173
walked around in a state of shock. I see. I did not 
miss a class. My students didn't know what had

10:32.561 --> 10:35.704
happened to me. And so I went right on functioning. 
About the first action that I had the presence of

10:43.441 --> 10:57.197
mind to take was in February, I made an appointment 
with Dr. Williams and told him that I didn't expect

10:43.441 --> 10:57.197
him to upset the whole system by going back and 
reversing the decision. but that I would like for

10:58.021 --> 11:12.621
him to find me some other position somewhere on the 
campus because this was my home and I love Texas A&M

10:58.021 --> 11:12.621
and I felt that there was still a service that I 
could make to the university. So he asked me to

11:13.262 --> 11:25.058
write a letter making this request and several 
weeks later he replied saying that he could not

11:13.262 --> 11:25.058
find anything in the whole system that would 
utilize my talents.

11:28.396 --> 11:36.169
Then at the end of February or early in March, I 
started a barrage of letters to all sorts of

11:28.396 --> 11:36.169
people. I guess I had to give credit to my father for 
being the spirit who stood behind me and said,

11:36.710 --> 11:45.564
stand and fight. He said, your best chance is here 
at Texas A&M. So I wrote to... H-E-W, I wrote to the

11:53.928 --> 12:22.956
EEOC, I wrote to the AHA, I wrote to the AAUP, I wrote 
to Francis Farenthold, I wrote to many people,

11:53.928 --> 12:22.956
trying to find out what support I could get, hoping 
that I could line up a rather formidable array of

11:53.928 --> 12:22.956
support, and then approach the administration 
and say, look, let's do something, or I'm going to

11:53.928 --> 12:22.956
train. artillery yes but the eeoc sort of blew the 
whole case open i always understood that when the

12:23.408 --> 12:48.471
government hew or any of these agencies 
corresponded with you that they never let your

12:23.408 --> 12:48.471
name be known to your employers for feeling some 
sort of retaliation so it came as quite a surprised

12:48.873 --> 12:57.762
to me when some of my friends in the history 
department acted very icy, virtual icicles in the

12:48.873 --> 12:57.762
air. And the whole thing back of it was that the 
Equal Employment Opportunities Commission had

12:59.284 --> 13:13.058
sent a form to President Williams giving my name 
and saying that a complaint had been filed in my

12:59.284 --> 13:13.058
name. on a charge of sex discrimination. And he had 
circulated this to the dean and to the history

13:16.437 --> 13:20.382
department. And they considered this not really 
playing very fair, going, squealing at the

13:21.784 --> 13:27.712
government.

13:30.596 --> 13:34.921
Actually,

13:30.596 --> 13:34.921
I hadn't filed the complaint. All I had done was to 
write a letter stating, this is what happened to

13:34.941 --> 13:39.508
me. Can you help me? But on the basis of my letter of 
inquiry, they had informed the whole

13:43.565 --> 13:51.636
administration, so there was really nothing to do 
but to go ahead and notarize that formal

13:43.565 --> 13:51.636
complaint. I think this was probably a good thing. 
Well, yeah, it forced my hand earlier than I had

13:55.021 --> 14:00.148
expected, but it worked out well. Certainly. And 
not very long after that, I employed an attorney.

14:05.696 --> 14:09.000
How did you go about selecting an attorney? Well, 
again, I have to give my father credit. They spend

14:11.527 --> 14:14.931
their winters in southern Texas. On their return 
to Ohio, my dad had been reading the local news

14:15.772 --> 14:23.160
sheet. This was about the time that Sarah 
Weddington had taken the case to the Supreme

14:23.261 --> 14:33.953
Court, the Texas abortion law case, and had gotten 
it declared unconstitutional. So her name was in

14:34.974 --> 14:37.517
the news. Dad's feeling was that we don't want just 
any lawyer. We're going to get a good lawyer.

14:44.352 --> 14:47.295
Somebody who might even have a political stake in 
it. Who might get some mileage out of the case if it

14:47.975 --> 14:51.459
ever went to court. So I wrote to both Frances 
Ferrentholdt and Sarah, I called Sarah

14:53.581 --> 15:00.829
Weddington on the phone and she took the case. What 
was her reaction, her first reaction to the case

15:02.571 --> 15:05.814
when you called her? Did she thank you? had a 
reasonable case? Well, nothing could be

15:10.579 --> 15:13.782
determined until I talked to her about it. So I made 
a trip over to Austin and talked to her for at least

15:14.023 --> 15:18.608
an hour. I see. I was very impressed with her. I was 
very pleased with her as an attorney. She was not

15:27.138 --> 15:31.423
one of these boat rockers that figures walk. Let's 
go out for publicity. Let's make as many waves as

15:32.845 --> 15:34.707
possible. All of her counsel was well, let's play 
it quietly and not get people's backs up, not put

15:37.555 --> 15:50.190
them on the defensive until there is no other 
recourse. There's plenty of time for wave making

15:50.951 --> 15:55.015
if they're totally obstinate. And she must have 
felt that I had a case because she took it.

16:03.365 --> 16:05.908
Well, then what was your next step? after you 
acquired or retained a lawyer. What was her advice

16:09.981 --> 16:12.927
to you at this point? Just to wait until the Equal 
Employment Opportunities Commission made their

16:12.947 --> 16:23.326
investigation and made a report. Plus, I needed to 
follow all avenues of appeal on campus because

16:25.717 --> 16:36.747
there was no possibility of going to court until 
all other possibilities had been exhausted. But

16:37.188 --> 16:39.250
there was plenty of time for that in the fall.

16:42.553 --> 16:51.441
The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission 
said that they were overloaded with cases and they

16:42.553 --> 16:51.441
didn't know when they would get to me, but they put 
mine on a fast track. And I expected them here in

16:54.725 --> 17:00.133
June, but it was July when Brenda Becker came from 
San Antonio. I talked to her and she talked to

17:02.357 --> 17:05.502
several people on campus. It was sort of 
interesting that when she informed the

17:05.922 --> 17:22.268
administration that she was coming, they set up an 
appointment with Ray Smith, who is the head of

17:05.922 --> 17:22.268
personnel, which sounds like a very logical place 
to send her, except Ray Smith is in charge of

17:23.598 --> 17:28.904
janitors and maids. He's in charge of staff, not 
faculty. Right. Dr. Calhoun is the faculty.

17:37.093 --> 17:50.348
So I informed her of what they had done, and I think 
that she felt somewhat enlightened by

17:37.093 --> 17:50.348
that revelation. That's interesting. Well, do 
you know what transpired between Smith and

17:52.048 --> 17:57.795
Becker? Well, he apparently was the one that she 
worked with to get the records. And she told the

18:04.264 --> 18:07.568
university what records she wanted. Personnel 
files. And these had to be subpoenaed. And the

18:14.938 --> 18:19.103
university talked her out of as many files as she 
requested. I think it finally got down to all

18:19.538 --> 18:34.791
people who were up for tenure in 1972, plus 
probably all women on campus, on the faculty. And

18:34.811 --> 18:36.833
then the university opened these files. All 
people whose files were subpoenaed had an

18:37.113 --> 18:41.897
opportunity to go and look at their files. So in 
August, I looked at my file and found that it was

18:42.998 --> 18:48.583
sketchy. there were things missing, that the 
evidence on which they made the decision in my case

18:49.525 --> 18:58.878
was only partially there. Did you inform Becker? 
Yes, and also Dr. Calhoun, and my record was, the

19:01.421 --> 19:08.611
gaps were filled in. Almost put back together 
again.

19:13.056 --> 19:16.461
Well, it was sort of interesting, every year we 
have to make out these Form 3s, which tells what

19:16.745 --> 19:19.889
you've been doing all year. But it was also part of 
the instructions. We didn't need to put in things

19:24.675 --> 19:27.960
that we had done every year. I see. And these are the 
things that they used to make the tenure,

19:29.161 --> 19:36.310
promotion, salary increases. But they hadn't all 
those on file. They had only looked at the most

19:41.357 --> 19:45.903
recent one, which left my whole honest story. I 
see.

19:51.693 --> 20:00.326
So, Ms. Becker buried herself in those files and 
she told me that she should have a preliminary

19:51.693 --> 20:00.326
report ready by the first of August. No, no, the 
first of September. But the first of October came

20:04.712 --> 20:08.638
and of course my phone bell mounted because very 
patiently, kept checking with her. And the first

20:12.468 --> 20:16.353
of November came. She was sick for quite a while in 
November, and the first of December came. But

20:21.741 --> 20:30.373
just before Christmas vacation, I called her. And 
off the record, not for telling anybody, she said

20:31.074 --> 20:37.883
that she was presenting a letter of determination 
in my favor. Her superior might change it. The

20:46.001 --> 20:49.547
chances weren't very strong that he would, but he 
might. But for my own peace of mind at least, I could

20:51.069 --> 21:02.790
go off to San Francisco to the American Historical 
Convention knowing that this letter was in the

20:51.069 --> 21:02.790
works.

21:05.183 --> 21:07.786
Well, they were having a typing crisis. 
Apparently they only had one typist in the office

21:07.806 --> 21:12.552
there in San Antonio to do all their work. And so 
even though the letter was in the mail, it would be

21:12.612 --> 21:19.960
the end of January before it would get typed. I 
volunteered to go over and type it myself.

21:23.484 --> 21:24.886
Certainly. So Sarah Weddington got on the phone 
for me. And she had some connections. So it got

21:31.453 --> 21:34.617
typed maybe a couple of weeks earlier than that. I 
received my letter of determination on a

21:35.373 --> 21:51.078
Saturday, and of course the administrative 
offices weren't open, so I knew before Dr.

21:35.373 --> 21:51.078
Williams knew, and I knew what was coming in his 
mail Monday morning. And at that point, things

21:52.480 --> 21:55.845
began to fall into place. Well, what happened 
after the administration received the letter of

21:56.888 --> 22:00.834
determination? Well, I guess I should back up a 
little bit. I forgot one kind of interesting

22:03.839 --> 22:06.664
episode. I went to see Dr. Calhoun at the end of 
Christmas Vacation. Sarah Weddington had

22:14.857 --> 22:19.604
advised me to ask him about summer teaching. My 
contract ended May 4th. 31st, 1974. But she

22:25.670 --> 22:31.195
suggested that I talk to him about teaching in the 
summer. Well, he brushed that off. He said, well, I

22:32.856 --> 22:34.418
don't know. He said, go back and ask Dr. Gooch to 
approach me on this. But he said, my understanding

22:38.681 --> 22:44.367
is that your employment ends, and so that's 
probably the end of that. And then I asked him, what

22:45.928 --> 22:51.533
if the government should find in my favor? knowing 
that my letter was probably on the way. And his

22:56.893 --> 22:58.996
reaction was, how could they? I don't see any way 
that they could uphold your charge of sex

22:59.517 --> 23:04.825
discrimination.

23:07.990 --> 23:12.977
So I smiled knowingly and didn't reveal that I knew 
that such a letter was coming. He spent most of the

23:14.339 --> 23:21.570
interview

23:14.339 --> 23:21.570
discussing what he would do if he were me. He was 
trying to advise me. To leave? Well, no. I really

23:28.223 --> 23:34.168
appreciated it very much, and I trusted his 
sincerity. He gave me a list of several things that

23:34.368 --> 23:38.092
he would do for me. This was an unprecedented case. 
He didn't like overturning administrative

23:41.214 --> 23:44.377
decisions. It was sort of almost a matter of faith 
that it was sin to change a decision However, I

23:52.195 --> 23:55.039
could ask. And this would be putting him on a 
terrible spot. And he wished that I wouldn't put

23:58.043 --> 24:00.546
him on a spot. But since I had exhausted all other 
appeals, he was opening a new court of appeals if he

24:02.829 --> 24:13.324
would reconsider my case. And on the basis of the 
fact that I had a new chairman and it was a whole new

24:14.545 --> 24:19.452
ballgame, David Morgan, who had been the colonial 
historian, was gone, and now they could no longer

24:19.718 --> 24:26.006
say that I was a duplication. On the basis of the 
fact that no rules on tenure had been published, no

24:26.046 --> 24:37.822
guidelines, no standards, what do we expect in 
people who are being granted tenure? In other

24:37.902 --> 24:40.486
words, you don't have one within the department. 
No. A tenure statement. Nor in the university.

24:45.813 --> 24:48.156
That's funny, because it's the first thing the 
library did. When we got faculty status over

24:48.423 --> 24:52.188
there, this you will do. This is what is required of 
you. No, there was nothing. Not in the university,

24:55.753 --> 25:02.682
not in the College of Liberal Arts, not in the 
department. And Calhoun himself published one,

25:02.722 --> 25:09.070
but it was December of 73 when he did it. Oh, I see. It 
was December of 73, yeah. So it was a whole year

25:12.735 --> 25:17.181
after he'd been fired that he came up with a 
guideline. So adding all those things, he said, go

25:18.072 --> 25:27.463
back and write me a letter stating all these 
reasons why I should open up your case again. Well,

25:29.645 --> 25:36.293
before I got the letter written, oh, he didn't want 
me to write the letter until he informed me that he

25:29.645 --> 25:36.293
was ready to receive the letter. And before that 
happened, they got the letter of determination

25:37.675 --> 25:41.419
from the EEOC.

25:43.622 --> 25:47.286
And nothing happened immediately. But in 
February, this is 74, there was a meeting of the

25:48.194 --> 25:58.866
board, one of the quarterly meetings of the board 
of directors. And Dr. Monroe had made a statement

25:58.886 --> 26:07.896
in the paper that the board of directors would no 
doubt be discussing my case, so I wanted to be there

25:58.886 --> 26:07.896
and hear what they had to say about me. Well, I 
didn't want to sit in on everything, so I wanted to

26:10.418 --> 26:18.167
find an agenda and see just where on the agenda my 
case fell. So I called Dr. Williams' office to find

26:20.729 --> 26:24.876
out what the agenda was. And they referred me to Mr. 
Cherry's office. So I called over there. Oh, I was

26:32.368 --> 26:35.313
referred to Dr. Calhoun's office. Well, pretty 
soon the word spread around that Dr. Statham was

26:36.135 --> 26:40.622
looking for an agenda.

26:43.547 --> 26:46.652
And Mr. Cherry called me and said, Everybody has a 
right to see this agenda. You come right in

26:48.750 --> 26:50.232
immediately. So I went to Dr. Cherry's office, 
looked through the agenda. I was not on the agenda.

26:56.400 --> 27:03.530
And one of the things, this is the annual meeting 
where they decide who was to be given tenure, and

26:56.400 --> 27:03.530
they had a list of all the people who were to be given 
tenure. Oh, I think I've left something out. Yeah,

27:07.936 --> 27:12.382
I think you're on the punchline. I had been 
verbally told that I would, had tenure, and I had a

27:16.248 --> 27:25.841
letter from Dr. Calhoun, but I was not on the list 
for tenure, and I wondered why. And this troubled

27:27.644 --> 27:29.627
me somewhat. Well, let's see, there is something 
backwards here.

27:40.202 --> 27:41.243
Now, I didn't know yet.

27:45.239 --> 27:52.730
Well, at any rate, Dr. Calhoun called me in, and 
immediately.

27:55.294 --> 27:58.198
The instructions were, at your earliest 
convenience, come in. He was in a meeting of the

28:00.501 --> 28:09.495
deans, and he came bringing Dean Maxwell, and he 
said, what Dean Maxwell has to tell you I think will

28:00.501 --> 28:09.495
make you very happy. If there are any questions, 
you can see me after this meeting. but I don't

28:15.125 --> 28:19.571
believe it'll be necessary for you to attend that 
board of directors meeting.

28:22.435 --> 28:28.343
So then Dean Maxwell sat down with me and told me 
that I had tenure and that all was well. And then you

28:30.486 --> 28:32.168
received a letter shortly after that? Yeah, I got a 
letter from Dr. Calhoun. Confirming this. But I

28:35.894 --> 28:44.946
still,

28:35.894 --> 28:44.946
now that the events are, there's still a cart and a 
horse mixed up here. Because I was still very

28:45.415 --> 28:49.519
concerned about why I was not on the official list. 
No action had been taken. Well, about this time,

28:52.242 --> 28:59.148
there was an initiation of a freshman honors 
society, and I was made a member. And Mrs. Smith,

29:00.489 --> 29:08.998
the only woman on the board of directors, was 
giving the address, and arrangements were made

29:00.489 --> 29:08.998
that I could be there so I could meet her. And I asked 
her if they had discussed me at the meeting. And she

29:14.947 --> 29:18.010
said, no, the issue never came up. I said, well, in 
any of the behind-the-scenes meetings was my case

29:18.030 --> 29:23.736
discussed? No, nothing was discussed. So I was 
very concerned about this because Dr. Nance and

29:25.898 --> 29:33.767
maybe some others were saying, the case isn't 
settled. She doesn't have tenure. The board of

29:34.788 --> 29:36.470
directors didn't do it. And my friends were 
beseeching me, why wasn't your name in the paper?

29:42.276 --> 29:43.637
Why weren't you on the list? And so I still felt very 
uneasy about it. And so Dr. Calhoun called me in

29:46.551 --> 29:54.641
again and said, isn't this enough? You've gotten a 
letter. It's in writing. You have tenure. And

30:01.631 --> 30:12.966
about a couple of days after that, after Dr. 
Calhoun and I had a very firm understanding and a

30:01.631 --> 30:12.966
very pleasant conversation, I got a phone call 
from Dr. Williams. Why had I approached Mrs.

30:13.300 --> 30:17.448
Smith? Why did I bring this up? He hadn't really 
wanted the Board of Directors to know about this.

30:22.938 --> 30:32.976
It's true, the Board of Directors are the only ones 
that could grant tenure, but Dr. Calhoun, I had it

30:22.938 --> 30:32.976
in writing it would hold up in any court, wasn't I? 
Satisfying. Well, what had happened was Mrs.

30:36.301 --> 30:44.752
Smith, after she gave her little talk, spent the 
night at Dr. Williams' house and had asked him

30:36.301 --> 30:44.752
about me. And so he was distressed that I had gone to 
the board of directors, or one of the board of

30:46.914 --> 30:55.525
directors, about the case, because he hadn't 
wanted to trouble them with the whole thing. That

30:57.287 --> 31:03.355
simply by being here and teaching next fall, I 
would have de facto tenure And next spring, next

31:03.824 --> 31:09.790
February, when they have their list, my name will 
be on that list. By that time, the board of

31:10.371 --> 31:13.915
directors will have forgotten about the case. 
Whereas if he had come into this last meeting and

31:14.436 --> 31:25.468
said, oh, I want you to add one more name, and had 
said, here's the name, they would have said,

31:14.436 --> 31:25.468
Bonnie Stadelman, isn't she the one that's suing 
the university? And then there would have been a

31:25.488 --> 31:27.570
big hoover-off. I doubt it. Well, that's what he 
is. thinking wise. They probably would never have

31:31.121 --> 31:35.146
noticed had they changed the list, saying, we have 
a list change here. We've left a name off. Well, he

31:36.808 --> 31:40.111
felt that it would create all sorts of 
disturbance. And so... At least they could have

31:42.094 --> 31:47.420
informed you of why they were going to do this. 
Yeah. Well, I wasn't. And so I walked into a sticky

31:49.823 --> 31:53.066
situation. Listen to me. It just seems to me it 
could have been done For one thing, I doubt that the

31:57.689 --> 32:01.614
board would ever have looked at the entire list of 
names. It's usually done by... Well, you see, the

32:02.435 --> 32:06.160
agenda is a very official looking thing. It's a 
great big document. And to come in and say, oh, add

32:08.504 --> 32:11.708
this one name. And Dr. Williams, I believe, had 
called each of the members of the board personally

32:11.748 --> 32:23.484
about my case after the letter of determination 
came in. And his feeling... from sort of an

32:27.524 --> 32:31.210
unofficial poll of the board of directors was, 
let's fight it. We don't want the government

32:32.471 --> 32:36.037
telling us what to do. And so he figured that it 
would create quite a stir. Who do you think decided

32:42.186 --> 32:44.510
to capitulate? I think this was Dr. Calhoun's 
decision. I have to give him credit with being,

32:48.636 --> 32:56.788
having enough vision to be able to change a 
decision.

32:58.844 --> 33:07.017
He had a meeting with Dr. Gooch about the time the 
letter of determination came in. And then he

33:07.597 --> 33:11.884
called a meeting of all the full professors in the 
history department. And I can only report this as

33:13.887 --> 33:17.392
hearsay. But it came from two different sources 
that he said, I am an engineer. I have to rely on you

33:28.207 --> 33:32.252
people for determining people's qualifications 
in history. I can't make these decisions. And you

33:34.836 --> 33:40.524
people have told me that she's not of the caliber 
that we want here at Texas A&M. But the government

33:41.485 --> 33:46.492
looks at her record and says that she is qualified. 
And Dr. Gooch comes in as head of the department.

33:49.816 --> 33:51.058
He's more or less an outsider. And he tells me that 
she is qualified. Now, what was your thinking on

33:54.663 --> 33:57.707
this? And in turn, each professor had to justify 
his vote. And at this point, there was

34:05.173 --> 34:12.884
considerable squirming, considerable alarm 
that they might have to testify in court. And many

34:15.368 --> 34:21.096
of them did not wish to be subjected to court 
interrogation. would have been much worse than

34:21.430 --> 34:30.823
simply a friendly questioning by Calhoun, 
because then there's an opportunity to

34:21.430 --> 34:30.823
cross-examine. Interesting, yes, very 
interesting. And Dr. Gooch let it be known that the

34:32.145 --> 34:38.995
administration's case would look very bad in 
court. At this time, especially, yes. And he and

34:43.742 --> 34:51.032
Dr. Nance had a very heated discussion in 
Calhoun's office over... whether to go to court,

34:52.784 --> 34:55.168
and Dr. Nance wanted to go to court with it.

34:59.234 --> 35:03.901
Again, hearsay.

35:03.921 --> 35:06.225
That's very interesting. And I was quite willing 
and ready to take it to court, if nothing else. Oh,

35:12.334 --> 35:14.177
yes, naturally, you had nothing to lose. And with 
the government behind me, with those rather

35:14.858 --> 35:20.867
interesting statistics about how few women there 
were at Texas A&M on the faculty. And so this is

35:27.112 --> 35:31.597
where it stands now, you don't have to wait until 
the board meets again? Well, that's a mere

35:31.637 --> 35:34.721
formality. I see, I see. Could you possibly tell us 
any other names of people who gave you support

35:38.746 --> 35:46.956
during this period off the university, outside? 
Well, the American Historical Association has a

35:49.147 --> 36:00.501
committee on women, which was in regular 
correspondence with me. And there wasn't much

36:00.521 --> 36:06.588
they could do, but they were willing to do whatever 
could be done. And this is one of the things that

36:07.570 --> 36:15.219
caused Dr. Williams some anguish, because he 
didn't realize that I had been writing to them. And

36:15.679 --> 36:18.563
so it came as kind of a surprise when I had the clear 
blue sky. He got a letter offering their good

36:18.863 --> 36:28.375
services and mediating and so forth. I saw the 
letter. I read it very hastily. Dr. Gooch has a copy

36:31.018 --> 36:33.321
of that letter. And it seemed like a very moderate 
letter. But Dr. Williams' reaction was, this is

36:38.507 --> 36:41.211
meddling. It was unprofessional. And he'd been a 
member of the AHA. since he got his PhD and he was

36:46.657 --> 36:56.428
quite distressed that I had appealed to them and 
they had jumped into this whole thing.

37:02.816 --> 37:13.508
I had a lot of support from other faculty members, 
people who kept checking with me continually, how

37:02.816 --> 37:13.508
is it coming, what's happening.

37:14.500 --> 37:18.866
But the most gratifying of all was the support from 
the students. My students were just wonderful. I

37:23.272 --> 37:32.105
received many letters and even more verbal 
reassurances that I was a worthy teacher. Well,

37:32.385 --> 37:37.032
when you look at it, really, what other point is 
there for you being here? Well, this is my

37:38.073 --> 37:39.936
thinking. This is a university, and without the 
students, the whole place is nothing. But

37:44.285 --> 37:55.035
apparently the higher you get in the 
administration,

37:44.285 --> 37:55.035
the less contact they have with students, the more 
they forget that.

37:59.200 --> 38:07.608
Well, as you look back now over the whole thing, do 
you have any

37:59.200 --> 38:07.608
words of wisdom? Oh, I feel much wiser now that it's 
happened.

38:15.537 --> 38:16.939
happened to me. I have never failed at anything. 
And to come up against a failure at this point in

38:20.704 --> 38:27.053
life was really soul-wrenching. But now that it's 
over, I have learned a lot. I am not as naive as I once

38:35.064 --> 38:39.310
was. I am much more aware of political happenings 
in a faculty.

38:49.426 --> 38:57.914
I have tested the limits of my strength somewhat 
and found that I was a lot stronger than I thought I

38:49.426 --> 38:57.914
was. I've learned a lot about myself in the 
process. And whereas I probably don't deserve as

39:04.441 --> 39:11.868
much credit as I get, because without the 
government, it wouldn't have amounted to too

39:04.441 --> 39:11.868
much. But nevertheless, I understand that a lot of 
women give up somewhere along the line. But I

39:18.888 --> 39:23.275
didn't back down. I wonder, do you hold any of this 
against the university per se? Do you still like

39:30.185 --> 39:31.908
A&M? Oh, I still like A&M, yes. And no, bitterness 
only is an acid that only corrodes the person who's

39:33.870 --> 39:42.463
holding it. The department under Dr. Gooch is a 
whole different universe. It's much warmer,

39:50.029 --> 39:54.155
friendlier. The

39:54.195 --> 40:02.648
members of the department who voted against me are 
very civil, friendly even. The issue is never

40:03.389 --> 40:09.177
discussed, and it's as if it never happened.

40:12.852 --> 40:28.476
And I guess most of all, rather than finding that I 
was destroyed by failure, I learned what support I

40:12.852 --> 40:28.476
had, what friends I had, and most important, how 
the students felt about it. And I think I like to, I

40:30.840 --> 40:37.290
don't know about you, but I like to feel that the 
students are aiming at the administration and the

40:30.840 --> 40:37.290
faculty particularly.

40:41.185 --> 40:43.659
Anything else you'd like to comment on? I'll 
probably think of something later.
