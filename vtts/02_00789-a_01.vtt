00:01.634 --> 00:03.356
This is a test. This is Terry Anderson. Today's 
date is April 8, 1980. This is the second interview

00:08.282 --> 00:17.932
with Dr. Patton Burns of the Vet School on the Vet 
Medicine Project. This is a test.

00:29.145 --> 00:30.747
This is the second interview But Dr. Burns, last 
time we ended our first interview talking about

00:31.756 --> 00:43.832
Dr. Mark Francis, and this time I'd like to 
continue talking about personalities that you

00:31.756 --> 00:43.832
were involved with over the years. Do you have 
anything else to say about Mark Francis, or should

00:45.715 --> 00:49.059
we move on to others? I don't recall. Well, you were 
saying about the greatest man that you knew. Yes.

01:01.658 --> 01:13.052
Of course he did

01:01.658 --> 01:13.052
his world of experience in extension work, 
experimentation work primarily, and teaching.

01:14.534 --> 01:18.259
And he was it, of course, up until sixteen.

01:24.166 --> 01:29.353
But there's no end of stories about him. He was 
quite an interesting person. What about Ross

01:33.390 --> 01:36.814
Perry Marsteller? Well, yes. Dr. Marsteller 
came, I said, not until 16. I made a mistake there.

01:43.483 --> 01:58.902
Dr. Marsteller graduated from Ohio State 
University and came to Texas in 1905, I believe,

01:43.483 --> 01:58.902
to help Dr. Francis.

02:00.434 --> 02:11.986
In fact, from the time I knew it, from my experience 
from 23 on, Dr. Marsteller took care of more of the

02:00.434 --> 02:11.986
academics. And Dr.

02:12.226 --> 02:24.339
Francis, of course, taught anatomy and had the 
title of dean. But Dr. Marsteller did more of the

02:25.280 --> 02:27.943
work More the administration? Yes, oh yes.

02:33.557 --> 02:34.158
Why was that? Was he a better administrator do you 
think? No, probably because of Dr. Francis'

02:37.663 --> 02:44.773
difficulty in hearing. Oh, I see. And Dr. Marston 
enjoyed meeting people and he knew I think

02:55.160 --> 02:59.044
practically every mother and father of every 
student he ever had. It was more of a family

02:59.064 --> 03:03.988
proposition. What kind of person was Marsteller? 
Well, he was a very good teacher and I think a good

03:07.171 --> 03:12.055
administrator. Some

03:12.616 --> 03:19.963
of the students didn't like him. I think the 
majority of us did. Why didn't they like him? I

03:27.543 --> 03:31.948
think because he was quite harsh with them for a 
purpose.

03:34.971 --> 03:44.942
I think if they would have acceded to his advice,

03:34.971 --> 03:44.942
they would have been better off. In what way was he 
harsh? Well, he'd get on some pretty hard about

03:47.485 --> 03:53.972
that dress. wearing

03:54.931 --> 04:04.225
overalls and coveralls and things like that that 
he thought they should dress properly. Did he have

04:06.208 --> 04:07.249
a dress code? We didn't have any uniform code. We 
didn't have any dress code. Oh, you didn't. But he

04:10.694 --> 04:14.800
wanted them to look neatly and it was for their own 
good.

04:18.826 --> 04:24.735
I think he was, he has a, pardon me, As a hobby, of 
course, he was quite interested in horses. And he

04:29.694 --> 04:38.662
was an early riser, and he spent many, many hours at 
the veterinary hospital. I know he took his lunch.

04:39.863 --> 04:54.756
And Dr. Walton, who was president from 25 on, said 
that, told him he must be a poor administrator if he

04:39.863 --> 04:54.756
couldn't get time to go home and get a meal. why he 
must not have his work organized properly. But

05:01.686 --> 05:04.930
that was it. How do you think Marsteller got along 
with Dr. Francis? Fine, fine. Oh, I don't think

05:10.737 --> 05:15.422
anyone ever failed to get along with Dr. Francis. 
He was just that type of individual. Yes, that is

05:17.465 --> 05:18.165
right. Dr. Marsteller was harder to get along 
with, but I worked under him. In what way? Well, his

05:24.092 --> 05:25.654
personality. I might call him moody at times, but I 
could see it sometimes. I could tell when he walked

05:32.323 --> 05:34.666
in the front door in the morning. And I guess 
probably I was the first one he saw, and he was the

05:36.088 --> 05:42.517
first one I saw because it was so early. And I lived 
in the hospital, but I could tell and watch him

05:44.139 --> 05:52.890
during the day, and I'd know when to and not to cross 
him with anything, and so.

06:01.436 --> 06:02.637
How'd you get along with him? Fine, I got along with 
him fine. But I never had any trouble with any

06:05.760 --> 06:08.323
administrators. We had, fortunately, enough to 
have some very good administrators. I know when

06:16.171 --> 06:23.738
Dr. Francis died, there was some rumbling among 
some of the former students that they wanted

06:24.072 --> 06:26.635
somebody else from outside for dean. And I told 
them, I said, you're spinning your wheels. I said,

06:30.760 --> 06:32.782
the dean has already been selected. Well, I had 
talked to Dr. Walton about it. And so

06:37.148 --> 06:47.981
I could tell that he was going to make his choice. 
And he was leaning to Dr. Marsteller.

06:56.658 --> 06:58.700
highly recommended Dr. Marsteller. Of course, he 
didn't ask me for my recommendation, but he just

06:58.720 --> 07:05.926
asked for my opinion, getting a student's 
viewpoint. And, oh well, I was on the staff then,

07:05.946 --> 07:09.570
too, when that happened. And talked to a number, 
and he was made acting dean in fall of 36, and in 37,

07:10.791 --> 07:20.619
he was made dean. He was on a trial basis, I guess. 
did the same thing he'd been doing for years.

07:31.690 --> 07:36.537
They were thinking, though, about going to the 
outside, maybe back to Ohio State or something?

07:36.577 --> 07:45.510
Some of the former students, several of whom 
didn't care too much about Dr. Marsteller, but it

07:36.577 --> 07:45.510
was a personality clash. They'd had trouble with 
him somewhere along the way. And it was, I guess

07:48.475 --> 07:53.462
they figured there was a time to howl.

07:54.421 --> 08:01.091
I told some of them, I said, you may as well quiet 
down. I said, I think he's already been selected. I

08:03.855 --> 08:10.725
said, I'm not saying that he has been, but I feel 
pretty sure that Dr. Marshall is going to be our

08:03.855 --> 08:10.725
dean. And I said, at the time that I thought he'd 
make a good one, and I thought he did. Of course,

08:21.260 --> 08:22.622
then he got in bad health. Well, speaking of the 
former students, these were individuals,

08:24.610 --> 08:29.115
though. This wasn't the former student 
association, was it? No, no, no, no association.

08:33.760 --> 08:42.931
Has the former students, now that we're on this, 
has the former students association ever had any

08:33.760 --> 08:42.931
input into the administration of the vet school 
that you can remember? Not that I recall, not at

08:43.412 --> 08:45.214
all. Okay, now let's talk about Ralph Dunn. Well, 
he was...

08:55.643 --> 09:04.434
Because of Dr. Marsteller's health, he resigned 
as dean, and he had gone to Mayo's in Rochester. Oh,

09:04.694 --> 09:05.035
he did. He went to the Mayo Clinic. Yes, Mayo Clinic 
for surgery. What health problem did he have?

09:11.923 --> 09:22.596
Well, thyroid, and he had, I think, let it go a 
little too long, and I think that's one thing that

09:11.923 --> 09:22.596
perhaps influenced his or affected his 
personality, but not to a severe degree as far as I

09:23.150 --> 09:30.678
was concerned. But when you got up there, you

09:30.698 --> 09:42.069
got time to think about it more, and he stayed some 
time. I don't recall how long, but he never was in

09:42.150 --> 09:50.338
too good health from then on.

09:53.204 --> 10:06.985
So he relinquished the duties and

09:53.204 --> 10:06.985
Dean Bowden came in in 48, Dr. Dunn was in Dean in 47, 
48 I think, yes. For about one year. Yeah, one year.

10:10.470 --> 10:22.148
And then they brought in Dr. Bowden who was in 
research at Sonora Experiment Station. Dr.

10:22.567 --> 10:32.056
Boughton graduated in Ohio State in 1916, and then 
spent one year coaching football. He had been

10:32.337 --> 10:50.835
captain of the football team up there, and he was 
coaching the line in 1916, 17,

10:32.337 --> 10:50.835
and then he decided to go on with graduate work, and 
he went to the University of Illinois. and in

10:51.102 --> 10:55.488
research work. And from there he went to Haiti and 
for I believe in 1925 and he

10:55.508 --> 11:11.111
was there and there until 31. In 31, 32 he took 
graduate work back at Ohio State. He was just

11:19.570 --> 11:22.834
biding his time until some offer came along. Then 
the opportunity of that experiment station job at

11:23.755 --> 11:31.145
Sonora opened up. He started there in 1932 and 
remained there until 1948.

11:42.588 --> 11:48.737
I feel pretty sure that Dr. Dunn was dean under one 
year, maybe a year and a half, something like that.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.283
What kind of man was Dr. Dunn? Rather reserved, 
quiet. He'd spent his time, he came here in 1911,

11:53.986 --> 12:00.275
I believe. He was a graduate of Ohio State.

12:06.545 --> 12:09.810
He was in, took care of the

12:12.220 --> 12:14.102
hard collar serum laboratory. At that time they 
made whole blood hard collar.

12:27.716 --> 12:34.123
The private institutions took that over and made a 
serum rather than whole blood.

12:39.609 --> 12:41.991
The college discontinued the use of the hog collar 
work. And then Dr. Dunn switched to poultry. And he

12:52.430 --> 12:58.277
was a very good man in poultry science. And they 
made old chicken pox vaccine. I know one summer

13:02.121 --> 13:11.691
when I, in summer of 25,

13:02.121 --> 13:11.691
he was gone for a month or two. And they turned the 
job of making that chicken pox vaccine over to me

13:13.207 --> 13:24.940
and filling orders and things like that. And so I 
got to know Dr. Dunn's work pretty well that way. He

13:33.830 --> 13:34.551
was a good man.

13:37.514 --> 13:38.595
What kind of teacher was he? Very good. Good 
lecturer. But

13:43.430 --> 13:52.558
I don't know, unless he wasn't entirely sold. The 
administration wanted to put in, wanted to,

13:52.618 --> 14:13.015
at that time, the administration

13:52.618 --> 14:13.015
wanted to combine extension work, agricultural 
extension work, agricultural experimentation,

13:52.618 --> 14:13.015
and the teaching all in one. And Dr. Boughton 
implemented that, and he did that work and did a

14:14.092 --> 14:19.758
good job of it. I don't know unless some of them 
doubted that Dr. Dunn was sold on the idea of

14:20.619 --> 14:27.486
combining them. Some people were against it, some 
few. And it all turned out for the good. But

14:34.254 --> 14:42.242
I don't know what happened, but they...

14:43.555 --> 14:44.797
brought Dr. Boughton in. Yeah, doesn't it seem 
rather odd that Dr. Dunn would be here almost three

14:45.117 --> 14:53.728
decades and then they'd appoint him dean. He'd 
only last one year and then I think he went to

14:54.349 --> 14:57.013
Florida.

15:00.818 --> 15:07.546
No, he— He left in 1948, didn't he, after one year of 
being the dean? He married the former secretary in

15:13.559 --> 15:34.431
the School of Under-Medicine, Minnie Dunn, and 
she had inherited a farm down here around

15:13.559 --> 15:34.431
Wellborn, American, and he just resigned and 
started working down there at home. He just became

15:36.114 --> 15:38.217
a private citizen around here. I don't ever recall 
him going to Florida. Oh, then I mixed up. But

15:42.429 --> 15:49.456
nevertheless, he still, after just having that 
job for one year, all of a sudden resigns. And he

15:50.697 --> 15:51.798
wasn't that old. He wasn't in his 60s. I understand 
he was rather bitter about it, but I don't know any

15:55.962 --> 16:00.006
particulars. I know only the good parts about him. 
Did he set up his own clinic? No. So he just had his

16:12.846 --> 16:15.550
own ranch. He just dropped all of his activities in 
veterinary medicine.

16:22.379 --> 16:23.320
How about Dr. Schmidt? Dr. Schmidt

16:24.541 --> 16:34.174
I think was influenced in taking veterinary 
medicine here. At the University of Berlin, Dr.

16:35.572 --> 16:43.821
Francis had him in class, as all agricultural 
students did. Dr. Schmidt finished here, I think,

16:44.862 --> 16:53.632
in 1908 or 7,

16:44.862 --> 16:53.632
8, I believe. Yes, because then Dr. Francis was 
responsible for him having gone to University of

16:54.914 --> 17:05.005
Berlin. because he was brought up around Comfort, 
in Comfort, west of San Antonio, and German

17:05.238 --> 17:18.037
descent. In fact, he had quite a brogue. I don't 
know whether he ever talked any English at home.

17:27.111 --> 17:30.115
But he went to Berlin, and took four years of 
veterinary medicine, finished in 12, and came

17:30.314 --> 17:39.864
back here and married a native of Berlin. And she's 
still living here in Bryan. Oh, really? What's her

17:44.950 --> 17:48.434
name?

17:48.454 --> 17:56.362
Gertrude Schmidt, S-C-H-M-I-D-T. She's a 
patient in Bryan Hospital. She had a stroke,

17:56.382 --> 17:59.646
severe stroke, about a year or two ago. and

18:00.031 --> 18:06.739
she's in a coma. Oh, she is? Semicomatose, yes. 
They say that she can recognize you with her eyes,

18:09.122 --> 18:26.081
but the paralysis says she looks

18:09.122 --> 18:26.081
much younger and no wrinkles. She has a beautiful 
complexion. And they say she still has it. And

18:32.068 --> 18:38.954
he brought her back from Berlin? I don't know 
whether they married over there or I think she came

18:40.716 --> 18:48.844
over here and then they married over in the States. 
But he was implied to help Dr. Francis with a tick

18:48.864 --> 18:57.392
problem. and with the inoculation of calves in the 
wintertime for Texas tick fever.

19:12.364 --> 19:27.042
He was, Dr. Francis officially was Director of the

19:12.364 --> 19:27.042
Vendor Division of the Aero-Cushion Experiment 
Station. entitled, but Dr. Schmidt did the work.

19:32.385 --> 19:47.902
And then following Dr. Francis' death in 36, Dr. 
Schmidt was continued as he became administrator

19:32.385 --> 19:47.902
of the veterinary division. Did you ever have him 
for classes? No, he didn't do any teaching. See,

19:53.327 --> 19:55.089
they were separate by that time. Did you ever work 
with him? Oh, his office was right, my office was

19:58.038 --> 20:03.583
right above Dr. Francis. I was on the second floor. 
Dr. Schmidt was on the third floor. His office was

20:06.786 --> 20:08.007
right above me. So we saw each other every day when 
he was in town. He did a lot of, well, it's extension

20:12.270 --> 20:20.998
work himself, mostly experimentation, but some 
of that work was in West Texas. He might be gone for a

20:21.839 --> 20:23.540
week or two. Say poisonous plants problem would be 
in the, Edwards Plateau region or in the Big Bend or

20:27.147 --> 20:32.694
around Pecos. So he'd be gone for sometimes a week 
or two more at a time.

20:42.346 --> 20:52.378
But he was in an automobile accident on this Curtin 
Road and some man turned into the road and he never

20:42.346 --> 20:52.378
recovered. That was, he lived to be 71 or 71 and a 
half. Dr. Mesthal, I think, was 71. Dr. Francis,

21:03.825 --> 21:05.847
73.

21:10.371 --> 21:14.314
What kind of man was Dr. Schmidt? He was a great big, 
he had been a football player here. Really?

21:22.642 --> 21:26.685
I don't think he'd ever seen a football or touched a 
football until he got to A&M. And he, I guess it was a

21:27.560 --> 21:39.350
guard or tackle, I don't recall, but he was a big man 
and strong, very strong. But he got a little

21:41.051 --> 21:49.999
arthritis in his last few years, but it slowed him 
down a little bit, but he was still a strong man. He

21:50.459 --> 21:57.145
owned a place out on Curtin Road, and oh, I think 
they're finding that oil area and she sold it after

21:57.395 --> 22:23.554
that and he he had gone into uh he cooperated a great 
deal with the king ranch and uh but down there quite

21:57.395 --> 22:23.554
a bit of the time and uh he went in the santa 
gertrudis business and uh had some excellent

21:57.395 --> 22:23.554
santa gertrudis cattle and when he died and uh So 
somebody realized the value of those cattle. Mrs.

22:27.527 --> 22:30.090
Smith was going to sell them market price. And 
somebody realized that they were worth more than

22:30.210 --> 22:33.153
that. So

22:33.213 --> 22:44.786
someone had Dr. Jimmy Northway to come up from the 
King Ranch, the veterinarian down there, to

22:33.213 --> 22:44.786
evaluate them. And it saved her a lot of money. But 
she sold them at a good price.

22:54.061 --> 22:57.746
but unfortunately sold the land a little bit too 
soon.

23:00.971 --> 23:03.475
Because of the oil. Well, the prices of land in 
general over the county, too. How about Dr. Van

23:07.541 --> 23:10.725
Valkenburgh? Dr. Van Valkenburgh was brought in 
here from, in 1936,

23:19.812 --> 23:26.522
I believe in 1937 the Department of Parasitology 
was organized. At the same time that the

23:26.542 --> 23:32.090
Veterinary Hygiene was organized. And I know 
Jackie came up from Beaumont. He had the job, took

23:37.678 --> 23:42.165
the job that I had at Beaumont when I came back up 
here. And Dr. Kerr asked me, I was with Dr. Kerr, and

23:43.246 --> 23:49.195
he asked me if anyone I could recommend. Heard that 
Dr. Jagger wasn't too happy with his job in New

23:50.052 --> 23:55.199
Orleans. He was with three men, and they were all 
track veterinarians. And on the track season down

24:00.386 --> 24:10.419
there, Dr. Jagger had all the work to do, and it was 
mostly small animals, a lot of it small animals.

24:10.439 --> 24:18.810
And Karsten Dyke, Chapman, I've forgotten the 
other man's name, But I

24:19.955 --> 24:30.288
said Dr. Jange might be interested, and so he 
contacted him and he came. He stayed there from—I

24:30.348 --> 24:39.761
came up here in 26, he stayed down there until 37. 
Then he came up and took over veterinary hygiene.

24:48.423 --> 25:01.216
And at the same time, Dr. Marsteller was dean, and 
he thought we needed a department of

24:48.423 --> 25:01.216
neuroparasitology. So Dr. Turk took that over. 
Now wait a minute, I may be wrong about this. Dr.

25:11.186 --> 25:14.770
Turk took it over after Dr. Van Valkenburgh died. 
So Dr. Van Valkenburgh took it over in 37. until his

25:18.443 --> 25:21.888
death, and I don't recall that date. I believe 
about 46, something like that. I'm not positive.

25:29.097 --> 25:47.522
By Dr. Van Valkenburgh,

25:29.097 --> 25:47.522
I had been down on research work in parasitology in 
the Indies, I believe, and I'd forgotten his work

25:29.097 --> 25:47.522
that he was doing when he came here. but he was an 
excellent fine gentleman and a good teacher and he

25:48.464 --> 25:58.642
helped a lot. Do you remember Dr. Wharton? Arthur 
E. Wharton? Indeed I do. We came here together.

26:06.957 --> 26:13.088
He's a product of Colorado and he took the job in 26 
in in pathology when I took the job in physiology

26:14.772 --> 26:19.438
and pharmacology. Pathology then included 
parasitology and I guess you might say hygiene and

26:21.541 --> 26:39.025
let's see, I guess that takes it all, but he had the 
whole thing to do.

26:46.075 --> 27:14.968
He was an associate professor in charge, and I 
recall

26:46.075 --> 27:14.968
in, let's see, in 36 when Dr. Francis died,

26:46.075 --> 27:14.968
I think it took a year, and then Dr. Marstall and Dr. 
Wharton couldn't get along too well. So Wharton

27:16.501 --> 27:22.907
went to San Antonio, some crooked laboratories, I 
think. But I'd have a letter from him or a wire once

27:24.068 --> 27:34.517
in a while, telephone conversation with him once 
in a while, inquiring about this or that. And I saw

27:36.899 --> 27:40.002
him a couple of times before his death. I don't 
recall

27:41.443 --> 27:45.867
what date. I think Dr. Miller told me he was a rather 
unusual man. Yes, he had married ten times. Ten

27:53.103 --> 27:55.766
times?

27:57.127 --> 27:59.049
That means only nine. I remember wife number two

27:59.229 --> 28:06.075
and ten were the same person.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.181
And she was the one who shot him. Oh, that's right, 
yeah. Yes, it was unusual. I

28:17.745 --> 28:43.630
remember the occasion when we went with the whole 
student body

28:17.745 --> 28:43.630
down, which constituted only about 10 or 15, down 
to Sulphur Springs,

28:17.745 --> 28:43.630
downhill on the Navasota River, the bottoms. And 
so

28:44.993 --> 29:00.035
we sat around the campfire, drank some strong 
coffee, and both of us were wide awake. And some of

29:00.055 --> 29:07.366
the, two or three of the boys went with us, and I 
guess the boys wanted to go. They wanted to go frog

29:07.406 --> 29:13.735
gigging and

29:07.406 --> 29:13.735
tramp through the woods. And we left, I guess, must 
have been about twelve o'clock, something like

29:15.807 --> 29:22.234
that. So it was about five o'clock before we got 
back. And we got within about a hundred yards, and

29:27.800 --> 29:33.266
it was very dark. And we'd call, and of course those 
boys in the camp wouldn't answer us. And we were

29:42.316 --> 29:44.498
lost. And so finally we heard the fire had gone 
down, and so we heard some of them laughing.

29:58.947 --> 30:03.491
But

29:58.947 --> 30:03.491
he was a woodsman. He had many guns, and he was a gun 
collector. But a very strong man, very agile. But

30:15.967 --> 30:24.197
he had some very good qualities.

30:24.217 --> 30:27.422
But we never crossed each other. I don't recall a 
single word of disagreement that we ever had.

30:35.852 --> 30:41.940
But he did some things that I wouldn't have proved 
out, but I... I don't ever recall having a

30:42.342 --> 30:48.491
conversation with Dr. Marstead or any of the 
higher authorities about him. I think, I don't

30:49.873 --> 31:03.292
know who reported it, whether it was students of 
some of his activities, but

30:49.873 --> 31:03.292
he left in 37. Let's

31:03.532 --> 31:09.160
turn to your career now. in 1935 you were appointed 
head of the Department of Veterinary Physiology

31:10.068 --> 31:21.144
and Pharmacology, a position that you held for 
over three decades. Why did they appoint you? I

31:22.946 --> 31:26.131
can't answer that.

31:32.039 --> 31:39.349
I recall once in about 1933 or something I had, at 
two different times I had two different jobs

31:39.532 --> 31:42.252
offered to me.
