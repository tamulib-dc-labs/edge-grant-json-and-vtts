WEBVTT

00:04.908 --> 00:25.092
But

00:04.908 --> 00:25.092
I think what we need in a port such as this is a mix 
between good, substantial, solid citizen local

00:04.908 --> 00:25.092
types, people who are from this area. We want them, 
but a good mix also of people from outside the area.

00:32.853 --> 00:43.686
Most of whom will come in and live two or three years 
and then want to transfer back where they came

00:32.853 --> 00:43.686
from. I don't know if that would do it. We try to, 
because drugs is so corrupt and because there's so

00:45.308 --> 01:01.847
much money involved, and because we know that an 
officer who is well known in the community might be

00:45.308 --> 01:01.847
approached We try to take every precaution.

01:08.702 --> 01:26.362
We try to set up an atmosphere here in the court that 
won't allow any officer to ever do anything

01:08.702 --> 01:26.362
illegal because there's always somebody who 
might see him do it. In other words, we're all

01:26.382 --> 01:28.945
watching each other. It's hard to work under those 
conditions.

01:35.763 --> 01:52.520
Whenever somebody goes wrong, it at least is in 
part because there's an atmosphere that he worked

01:35.763 --> 01:52.520
in that allowed it

01:35.763 --> 01:52.520
to happen. I'm convinced that, let me give you an 
example of this sort of thing. We had an officer.

02:02.341 --> 02:09.249
When I first came here, he was arrested for 
molesting a teenage girl out here. She was

02:09.269 --> 02:17.699
crossing the border and he allegedly molested her 
and she complained. She was 14 years old. She

02:18.921 --> 02:27.010
complained to her mother and ultimately they went 
to the police and they charged him. He was

02:28.332 --> 02:29.293
convicted. And we got this officer. He 
transferred in from US Immigration

02:34.824 --> 02:41.673
Service. We get a lot of, or have in the past, had a 
lot of bilateral transfers from my agency. It's

02:47.761 --> 02:52.006
supposed, it should be a good way of recruiting 
people. But anyway, this guy got arrested and

02:52.026 --> 02:58.855
ultimately went to court and was convicted. And I 
asked around, because I was new here, And I went

03:01.690 --> 03:10.078
over to immigration and in conversation would 
bring him up and ask, what do you think about

03:01.690 --> 03:10.078
so-and-so? And invariably they'd say, oh, we knew 
this guy was, I'm not surprised that this guy had a

03:11.839 --> 03:19.046
long history of this kind of stuff. I said, what are 
you talking about? And they'd say, well, he was in

03:22.529 --> 03:31.377
the border patrol and he almost got fired for 
getting involved with some young girl When he was

03:32.183 --> 03:37.590
here as a customs, when he was in immigration, they 
were getting ready to fire him. And then new people

03:39.292 --> 03:42.517
picked him up. And he wasn't here 18 months before 
he got arrested. And he'd been in five or six years.

03:52.410 --> 03:54.192
And he had this history all through it. And people 
knew? Yeah. And in other words, they allowed this

03:56.996 --> 04:01.161
sort of thing to happen. And he supposedly was 
dating, he's a 30-year-old man, he was supposedly

04:02.525 --> 04:17.322
dating one of our Explorer Scouts, a 16 or 
17-year-old high school girl out here, and

04:02.525 --> 04:17.322
everybody knew it. I didn't know it. I would have 
put a stop to it. But what I'm saying is that he had

04:22.508 --> 04:29.916
this reputation, and nobody seemed to give a damn 
that he was doing this. In fact, when the

04:31.212 --> 04:59.515
Immigration Service, they were going to fire him 
for this same sort of thing, and he applies for a

04:31.212 --> 04:59.515
job, probably to save himself, and it's almost 
like in the old days, World War II days, and just

04:31.212 --> 04:59.515
after when a juvenile offender was taken before 
the judge and he was given this choice to either go

04:31.212 --> 04:59.515
to jail or go in the Army. And it seems like what we 
were getting with, they were telling them either

04:59.815 --> 05:06.965
go to jail or go to customs. And I went to Internal 
Affairs when I heard this. I said, what the hell is

05:10.871 --> 05:12.413
going on? Everybody tells me that they knew this 
guy was doing these sorts of things. How did we get

05:17.942 --> 05:18.763
him? Didn't you interview people? Didn't you do a 
background check? And they said, yes, we did.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.198
Well, they actually did a full field. 
investigation on this guy's background. I said,

05:32.645 --> 05:37.611
didn't you go to the immigration service and ask 
questions? They said, yeah. I said, well, how did

05:39.413 --> 05:40.975
we get this guy? He said, well, we didn't ask the 
right questions.

05:47.163 --> 05:50.326
And I said, didn't they, and nobody volunteered 
that this guy was? He said, no, they didn't

05:50.386 --> 05:55.873
volunteer because they wanted to get rid of

05:50.386 --> 05:55.873
him. And this is a, you know, it's a It's kind of a 
bizarre example, but we permit this to happen.

06:06.047 --> 06:16.117
These two guys, one of whom got recently convicted 
on the two bribery counts, he was always flashing

06:06.047 --> 06:16.117
money out here. I found out after the fact. He was 
always bragging about his conquests with the

06:21.042 --> 06:24.565
girls. He was acting like a two-bit hustler out 
here. And everybody was just, they sort of were

06:29.497 --> 06:35.585
entertained by him. And by listening to him brag,

06:35.985 --> 06:50.644
watching him flash his big bankrolls of money, he 
had over $1,000 in cash when he was arrested. He had

06:50.724 --> 06:53.387
$16,000 in cash hidden away in his house. You know 
what I mean? Yeah.

07:00.104 --> 07:04.169
That's what we're trying to do as far as integrity. 
We're trying to not allow it to happen by making an

07:04.249 --> 07:15.122
atmosphere that makes it impossible for somebody 
to do this. And the only way we can do that is

07:15.142 --> 07:21.370
everybody has to watch everybody else. I'm in 
business school at A&M. And they're teaching us

07:23.658 --> 07:26.020
right now about internal control. And they're 
saying no one likes it until there's a problem. And

07:29.204 --> 07:35.730
everyone loves it because at least there is a 
witness that can say .. We have dozens of internal

07:29.204 --> 07:35.730
controls. Every aspect of customs operation.

07:43.078 --> 07:52.247
We have somebody who's responsible to take a look 
at this particular type of transaction.

07:54.117 --> 08:00.545
and to take a look at the control and make sure it's 
working. Unfortunately, when you have to do it on a

08:02.428 --> 08:20.631
quarterly or bimonthly or monthly or by every pay 
period basis, it becomes so routine that people

08:02.428 --> 08:20.631
begin to just sign your name, send the paper in, In 
other words, they go through the motions. So we're

08:22.920 --> 08:35.632
also trying to make sure that when an officer is 
responsible for a specific control, that he

08:22.920 --> 08:35.632
really does what he's supposed to do. He goes and he 
talks to people involved in that particular

08:37.154 --> 08:40.777
activity. He says, do you do this? Or how do you 
handle a certain, how do you get the cash from this

08:45.542 --> 08:51.327
location over there if you're safe. And the guy 
says, well, I fill out such and such a form. I put it

08:59.229 --> 09:00.170
in this bag. I lock it. I take it over and someone 
signs for it. I say, okay, you show me how you do it

09:04.294 --> 09:09.938
instead of just taking his word for it. So we're 
working on that. We're working on integrity. We

09:14.983 --> 09:21.128
have musters twice a week where the officers on the 
day shift meet for an hour or a half hour. And we talk

09:26.639 --> 09:30.744
about integrity all the time. I send electronic 
mail messages frequently about integrity. We

09:35.570 --> 09:49.208
constantly reinforce, reinforce the need not 
only

09:35.570 --> 09:49.208
to be of the highest standards themselves, but to 
insist that their fellow officers also do And the

09:50.470 --> 09:59.620
first suspicion, we had a response to let us know so 
we didn't do something wrong. Because when

10:01.843 --> 10:09.171
someone gets arrested, as has happened here, it 
hurts us all for a long time. We had officers who

10:09.191 --> 10:16.579
were called up by friends and acquaintances when 
those two guys were arrested, asking saying such

10:18.584 --> 10:36.355
things, because I hope you're not involved and

10:18.584 --> 10:36.355
not in the building at the time.

10:36.375 --> 10:40.201
I'm not really aware of what it hurts when people 
call me out. In another issue of Newsweek, it was

10:40.221 --> 10:44.068
reported that the United States gave Mexico $140 
million in drug enforcement aid. Was that money

10:45.010 --> 10:55.482
productive, or could it have been better spent 
elsewhere, here in the

10:45.010 --> 10:55.482
States, on education? Well, I think it probably is 
worth the effort. I don't know whether it was cost

10:58.144 --> 11:04.251
productive, cost effective or not.

11:08.196 --> 11:11.659
I look at the drug war as an international thing. 
It's not an American problem. It's not a Mexican

11:13.481 --> 11:14.983
problem. It has to be hit from every angle. And I 
think that it's proper for us to be spending money

11:19.156 --> 11:29.366
in Mexico.

11:30.287 --> 11:45.122
Unfortunately,

11:30.287 --> 11:45.122
we have tried in the past for years to get Mexican 
officials to cooperate with us on drug

11:30.287 --> 11:45.122
trafficking.

11:46.688 --> 11:51.113
And for years,

11:46.688 --> 11:51.113
it hasn't worked. We've had several operations 
down here on the border that when we tried to work

11:53.777 --> 12:11.818
with the Mexicans, we gave them money, radios, 
weapons,

11:53.777 --> 12:11.818
in exchange for intelligence. And we never, they 
took the, equipment and the money that never gave

12:15.916 --> 12:20.001
us anything back. And so that program sort of 
foundered for obvious reasons.

12:27.610 --> 12:43.628
But I've got to say that it

12:27.610 --> 12:43.628
appears that like the Mexican authorities are 
really trying to do, they're really doing their

12:27.610 --> 12:43.628
best, they're trying very hard to contain drugs, 
to make seizures, to stop the trafficking through

12:45.110 --> 12:53.079
their country.

12:55.401 --> 12:56.423
I don't know why this is. I think it's

12:57.043 --> 13:04.892
international pressure. No country wants to be 
known as the drug capital of the world. There are

13:11.299 --> 13:13.902
three South American countries in Vietnam. 
Mexico, as far as the United States is concerned,

13:14.962 --> 13:31.098
certainly has what it takes as being the number one 
traffic in the country as far as I'm concerned.

13:31.118 --> 13:35.743
Virtually everything, as we said before, most 
everything comes through Mexico, if not the

13:31.118 --> 13:35.743
United States. But it looks like they're really 
trying to do something about it. It could be

13:40.347 --> 13:42.049
because they perceive themselves as having a drug 
problem of their own. This gets their attention.

13:49.989 --> 13:58.217
This is kind of off the subject, but I'll give you an 
idea of where my philosophy comes from. I used to

13:58.237 --> 14:03.182
work overseas in customs. And back in 1973, I went 
to Thailand

14:10.295 --> 14:25.698
work with a group of American and Thai customs and 
drug officials trying to develop contacts and

14:10.295 --> 14:25.698
trying to get them to cooperate. And at that time, 
it was Southeast Asian countries, as Thailand,

14:25.718 --> 14:36.775
that were major trafficking and producing 
countries for heroin from the United States.

14:37.919 --> 14:41.643
Thailand at that time was what Mexico is now. 
Everything that came to the United States seemed

14:43.005 --> 14:49.112
to come through Thailand. And so we were over there 
working with them, trying to give them money,

14:49.132 --> 14:55.899
equipment, and everything else, trying to get 
them to stop the flow. And I had a

14:58.262 --> 15:06.171
fairly high-level official over there told me 
that, first of all, they resented us being there at

15:07.501 --> 15:15.474
that time and trying to tell them how to run their 
country. And they were convinced and didn't mind

15:17.417 --> 15:22.665
saying that this was not a Thai problem. Drugs was 
an American problem. Americans would, it was an

15:26.211 --> 15:29.396
American demand. It was even Americans, they 
claimed, who were trafficking through Thailand.

15:35.800 --> 15:43.608
At that time, they were accusing the American 
military, because we still had military people

15:35.800 --> 15:43.608
there, bringing it through and out. And they were 
very hostile toward our efforts, uncooperative,

15:45.429 --> 15:56.220
and even arrogant. They said, you're proud. Don't 
bother us with this. I went back, though.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.472
Two or three years had passed. In fact, I think I 
went back again in 1979,

16:06.572 --> 16:18.283
six years later. Some of the same people were in the 
same group. This was a group of drug and, let's say,

16:22.687 --> 16:30.314
customs people from all over the world, going to 
Thailand and the United States. And so it was like

16:30.334 --> 16:32.296
old home with it. I knew a lot of these people on a 
personal basis. And the very same person who six

16:35.825 --> 16:58.571
years previously

16:35.825 --> 16:58.571
had told me and others that this was an American 
problem and that you were off base coming to their

16:35.825 --> 16:58.571
country and telling them how to run their country, 
he addressed this whole group of drug people. And

16:58.591 --> 17:03.857
the first thing he said was, we have a drug problem 
here in Thailand and we need your help. He was

17:05.407 --> 17:12.093
turned around, and what he was saying was, now we 
need your help. It is a Thai problem, he was saying.

17:16.797 --> 17:24.003
And he was saying that they looked up one day, and 
they found they had 50,000 addicts in Bangkok.

17:25.725 --> 17:27.266
Thais, not Americans, Thais. And they probably 
have a heck of a lot more than that. The only thing,

17:34.870 --> 17:58.130
and I think the same thing was true of France, of a 
lot of the Western European countries that we

17:34.870 --> 17:58.130
tried to get assistance from in the drug 
trafficking, they never perceived it as an

17:34.870 --> 17:58.130
international problem until they saw themselves 
as having a problem with addicts and traffickers

17:34.870 --> 17:58.130
in their own country. I think the same thing might 
be happening in Mexico. I think they perceive this

18:01.632 --> 18:04.675
now as being a Mexican problem because the drugs 
aren't just coming through. They're actually,

18:10.487 --> 18:16.513
some of them are winding up in the Mexicans. I think 
the same thing is happening

18:16.533 --> 18:24.660
in Columbia.

18:27.222 --> 18:35.590
The Columbians now are cracking down on the 
cartels are trying to in all the newspapers. And I

18:36.937 --> 18:47.149
have a feeling that the reason why is they see 
themselves

18:36.937 --> 18:47.149
as having a drug problem in Columbia.

18:49.673 --> 19:03.990
If there were no addicts in Columbia,

18:49.673 --> 19:03.990
then they probably would continue to just wade 
through the mud, considering it an American

18:49.673 --> 19:03.990
problem. And now they see it as a

19:05.692 --> 19:14.001
Colombian problem. And it may

19:14.121 --> 19:18.145
be too late. I don't know.

19:22.890 --> 19:23.811
But I think Mexico, in that sense, is really . OK. 
This is going in a completely different

19:23.911 --> 19:25.633
direction. But how would you compare the Mexican 
border to the Canadian border? Is there any basis

19:31.639 --> 19:34.602
for comparison in a completely different way? 
About the only similarity is that they're both

19:37.028 --> 19:42.015
borders. Canada, of course, is as much like the 
United States as you can get. It's not like a

19:50.648 --> 19:54.713
foreign country.

19:54.733 --> 20:01.043
There's a lot of free trade between the United 
States and Canada.

20:01.964 --> 20:06.951
Reciprocal.

20:08.602 --> 20:21.134
There are no drugs coming

20:08.602 --> 20:21.134
in to the United States through Canada.

20:21.154 --> 20:25.819
We know

20:21.154 --> 20:25.819
of very little, if there is. There's a lot of drugs. 
Is there a problem with drugs coming through the

20:26.700 --> 20:30.403
United States through Canada? I would say yes.

20:34.848 --> 20:37.090
I've never read any of them. I'd have to guess yes 
because the drugs have to come from somewhere.

20:43.605 --> 20:47.850
They have a problem in Canada as well as the United 
States. They probably come up through Mexico,

20:47.871 --> 20:53.177
through the United States, into Canada. Now, 
putting the shoe on the other foot, I don't know if

20:54.659 --> 21:05.111
we're giving them the kind of assistance that they 
want or that we would expect Mexico to give us. I

21:05.131 --> 21:05.732
hope we are. I think we are.

21:10.600 --> 21:16.949
There's been some talk of using the military or the 
National Guard to help control the borders. What

21:17.510 --> 21:21.676
are your thoughts on that? I think as a temporary

21:21.696 --> 21:39.882
situation, I think

21:21.696 --> 21:39.882
we're using National Guard right now to help us in a 
lot of these big border stations. to help us

21:41.380 --> 21:46.606
inspect cargo.

21:47.468 --> 22:04.068
Under the direction of custom inspectors, they go 
out on the cargo dock and help us watch and unload

21:47.468 --> 22:04.068
trucks so that we can do a good job inspecting it 
again. As far as troops out in the field between the

22:04.088 --> 22:10.476
ports, if that's what you're referring to, I think 
yes. by all means, let's do it. I think politically

22:13.263 --> 22:17.629
it's a little dangerous. The Mexicans

22:18.930 --> 22:27.742
and the Canadians vote, of course, but we're 
talking strictly about the southern border now.

22:29.464 --> 22:39.518
They resent anything that would look like we were 
arming our borders, massing the troops, so to

22:29.464 --> 22:39.518
speak, at the borders. It's an act of hostility in 
their eyes toward a country that we haven't been in

22:39.802 --> 22:51.778
war with since, well, since the Mexican-American 
War. And it's been not an open border, but it's been

22:54.322 --> 23:04.115
an unarmed border for all those years.

23:08.101 --> 23:08.982
And on the one hand, I think there would be a lot of 
protest from the Mexicans in general. On the other

23:13.894 --> 23:21.004
hand, a lot of them understand that we're doing 
what we have to do. They use their own troops on the

23:21.024 --> 23:27.112
Mexican side for drug interdiction. And they're 
doing a pretty good job, from what I understand.

23:30.537 --> 23:39.289
And it seems logical to me that they would also 
approve us doing the same on this side of the

23:30.537 --> 23:39.289
border. But I think anything that

23:39.927 --> 23:58.207
could help bring this thing under control,

23:39.927 --> 23:58.207
if we didn't try it, it couldn't hurt. Now we're 
going to on to even a different subject. Officer

24:03.493 --> 24:03.953
safety. Is the perceived threat on officer safety 
a real threat on the border? Yeah, it is. Customs,

24:15.652 --> 24:27.022
as a law enforcement activity, is probably not as 
dangerous as a lot of other law enforcement

24:15.652 --> 24:27.022
activities. It's not like being a policeman in a 
big city, a prime minister in a big city. Most of

24:35.850 --> 24:37.912
what we do is routine. Every once in a while, 
though, um there is this element

24:41.909 --> 25:06.246
of danger we we we try to we treat pops or safety as 
every person needs to watch out for himself and

24:41.909 --> 25:06.246
every person also needs to watch out for those 
around

24:41.909 --> 25:06.246
them we're under We work under the Treasury 
Department rules on law enforcement. We are

25:13.174 --> 25:14.075
armed. The only justification for an officer 
pulling, drawing a weapon is if he intends to shoot

25:16.597 --> 25:27.408
somebody. It's the only justification. You don't 
pull a gun to hold somebody, to cover somebody.

25:37.175 --> 25:38.677
Well, we don't do it. It's strictly self-defense 
and in defense of other innocent

25:38.697 --> 25:49.250
people. We have taken certain measures. We have 
installed security cameras. Some of ours aren't

25:56.239 --> 26:05.410
operational yet, but all along the border, we're 
putting in TV cameras and monitors, bulletproof

25:56.239 --> 26:05.410
glass. in a lot of our buildings.

26:12.294 --> 26:26.836
We have bullet-resistant

26:12.294 --> 26:26.836
vests that the officers can wear if they want 
options, if they feel threatened, or if there's a

26:12.294 --> 26:26.836
lookout on an armed and dangerous situation.

26:29.740 --> 26:31.983
We believe in the buddy system. We don't send 
anybody out to inspect a truck or an airplane at the

26:36.946 --> 26:46.120
airport by itself, people in pairs, supposedly 
one watching the other. We just take every

26:47.121 --> 26:49.124
precaution to protect ourselves. And does the 
recent ban on assault rifles have any significant

26:50.987 --> 26:59.099
impact on this?

26:59.119 --> 27:01.603
I don't think it will, because I think there are 
already enough in the hands of criminals, that

27:02.950 --> 27:09.278
they can do a lot of damage to us.

27:14.905 --> 27:23.636
The other thing that a lot of the inspectors now are 
carrying semi-automatic pistols. They're high

27:23.656 --> 27:24.737
powered. Instead of the six shot revolver, A lot of 
us are carrying in 12 to 15 shot 9mm

27:29.731 --> 27:43.747
semi-automatic pistons that will fire very 
rapidly. A lot of bullets in a short period of time

27:43.767 --> 27:52.398
without having to reload it. I don't know what kind 
of defense we could put up against automatic

27:56.545 --> 27:59.048
weapons. I don't know. We don't have any automatic

28:01.730 --> 28:07.596
weapons. I don't think the band

28:07.616 --> 28:19.628
can make a difference now. Okay.

28:23.917 --> 28:41.256
On just another little different tangent, the 
1986 Immigration Act, where they gave amnesty to

28:23.917 --> 28:41.256
the illegal residents of over eight years, has 
that had any impact on protecting our borders? No,

28:42.097 --> 28:45.741
I don't think so. The immigration situation is 
different from the drug situation. It's not to say

28:54.190 --> 28:59.155
that some of these people maybe won't carry small 
amounts in, or even large amounts. We don't know.

29:01.078 --> 29:23.522
But I think what the amnesty program has probably

29:01.078 --> 29:23.522
brought more and more people from Mexico, 
interior, and even more than that from Central

29:01.078 --> 29:23.522
America, into this area, looking for ways to do 
that. I don't think it affects customs, per se,

29:29.664 --> 29:35.631
that much. Okay, and two final questions. First of 
all, are we winning the war? And if not, what would

29:40.677 --> 29:45.643
it take to

29:40.677 --> 29:45.643
win? We're clearly not winning the

29:45.663 --> 29:51.990
war. As I say, I've been involved in this war, 
so-called war, since the Nixon administration,

29:53.135 --> 30:03.549
and it's only gotten worse every year since 1973. 
Every year is worse than the year before. The only

30:07.595 --> 30:18.450
way to win the war, in my mind, is a 
multi-directional

30:07.595 --> 30:18.450
kind of an effort. But the most important thing is 
we've got to stop the demand for it. I don't know how

30:26.628 --> 30:30.113
to do that. I don't know whether it means we have to 
arrest people who use it.

30:38.666 --> 30:47.039
We certainly need education, prevention, 
treatment, decriminalization maybe. I don't

30:47.059 --> 30:47.560
know. I don't know what the answer is. All I know is 
that there's always going to be an element in this

30:50.445 --> 31:00.779
society that appears to want to do the illegal 
drugs. Maybe only because they're illegal.

31:04.243 --> 31:10.372
They're always going to want to turn their friends 
on to

31:04.243 --> 31:10.372
it. Everybody knows crack is dangerous. But 
you've got a million kids who want to do it. I don't

31:16.940 --> 31:17.361
know why. You've got to get rid of the demand. As 
long as there's a demand, there are going to be

31:20.325 --> 31:28.236
people who are going to figure out some way to get 
into this country. If they can't get into this

31:28.256 --> 31:38.831
country, then they're going to find a way to 
manufacture something locally.

31:38.851 --> 31:45.660
It's the demand that's the problem, because as 
long as there's a demand, there are going to be

31:38.851 --> 31:45.660
people who are going to make money from it.

31:48.931 --> 31:50.630
Thank you very much, Mr. King. I appreciate your 
time.
