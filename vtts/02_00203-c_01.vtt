00:03.018 --> 00:07.583
A senior was just, he was everything. A freshman 
was nothing. Why that comparative

00:11.787 --> 00:18.774
democracy?

00:24.399 --> 00:33.008
I guess because we all sort of looked alike, 
dressed alike, did the same things together. And

00:34.237 --> 00:42.847
there were so few immodulants of, well, you knew my 
classmate of mine whose father was a Buick dealer,

00:34.237 --> 00:42.847
and he had a Buick. He got it his senior year. He 
didn't have one before then, because he couldn't

00:45.470 --> 00:48.074
have one until he was a senior. But there were some 
from successful business fathers, but I can't

00:49.135 --> 01:01.770
tell you what any ratios were. I would just call 
it... middle America to, I hesitate to use the word

01:03.886 --> 01:13.078
lower middle class and upper middle class. I sort 
of like the difference between a medium steak and a

01:13.278 --> 01:17.484
medium rare. I don't know what a medium rare steak 
is. I know what a rare is and I know what a medium is. I

01:23.131 --> 01:28.138
would say it was medium, middle class America. 
I've always thought, too, that what mattered is

01:29.570 --> 01:33.315
were you an Aggie or were you not. That's right. It 
didn't make any difference where you were from,

01:33.976 --> 01:39.583
what you were studying, who you were. It made 
absolutely no difference at all. The only

01:43.628 --> 01:58.767
difference was that

01:43.628 --> 01:58.767
even as a freshman, the lowest form of humanity on 
the face of the earth, except for every graduate

01:43.628 --> 01:58.767
from the University of Texas, What were the 
highest status student? And there was no, if the

02:04.167 --> 02:17.499
corps commander, even though more come to my 
outfit or to your outfit and tried to exercise his

02:04.167 --> 02:17.499
authority as the corps commander, there was a 
battery commander there, a troop commander. He

02:17.860 --> 02:18.640
was the boss. What were the highest prestige 
students? It was federalism at its best. Oh, okay.

02:24.266 --> 02:25.066
That's very good. Okay. What were the highest 
prestige students? offices, attainments? Well,

02:33.044 --> 02:36.309
I think there were some that got in as who's who. Oh, 
no, no, no, no, no, no. In your own mind, which did

02:37.971 --> 02:43.139
you and your colleagues most respect? The corps 
commander, the head yell leader, the what? The

02:45.542 --> 02:46.924
corps commander was very popular. Joe Slicker, in 
my opinion, was the most popular man in my class. He

02:53.113 --> 02:58.200
was a battery commander, and he was commander, 
captain of the RVs, of course, here. I think he was

02:58.754 --> 03:06.264
the most popular man in my class, although the 
Corps commander was very well liked as well. Bill

03:07.806 --> 03:11.370
Becker was his name.

03:12.051 --> 03:23.966
Were there other tasks that had...

03:12.051 --> 03:23.966
We paid no attention in the outfits to the 
battalion staff or to the regimental. The

03:24.267 --> 03:26.770
regimental commander of the Coast Guard was in my 
back.

03:32.538 --> 03:33.580
or not to do anything. Tom Haygood was his name. And 
he lived, he was a classmate of mine. In my back was a

03:39.230 --> 03:41.373
regimental planner. Okay, we're now to the, we're 
right near the end and we're to the end. The seniors

03:45.480 --> 03:47.003
were the ones in authority. My senior year, there 
was a flu epidemic that hit the campus. And at the

03:53.695 --> 03:58.022
mess hall, at the evening mess one day, The tally of 
attention and announcements were made that there

03:58.508 --> 04:04.573
would be a meeting of the senior class in DeWare 
Fieldhouse immediately after mass. That's all.

04:07.356 --> 04:09.418
So after mass we went down there. Bill Becker was up 
there, and he was a corps commander, and a couple of

04:09.438 --> 04:15.603
others. And the hospital was full. We had kids sick 
in the hallways in the dorms, and they were being

04:19.867 --> 04:26.513
ministered to by fellow students. So real 
epidemic. And the announcement was made, we've

04:28.951 --> 04:32.737
got a problem with this flu. And it's near 
Christmas time, about a week before Christmas

04:33.298 --> 04:38.906
holiday started. And they said, we think we ought 
to shut her down and go home and get off this campus,

04:39.507 --> 04:48.681
those of us that can get off. And what do you think 
about that? Everybody was in favor of that. It was a

04:52.487 --> 04:53.629
smart thing to do. Somebody said, well, go get 
baritrax. So he didn't live very far. He just lived

04:59.916 --> 05:03.561
on the other side of what is now G. Raleigh White. 
And so he got the nickname because he was just the

05:05.044 --> 05:11.774
hulk of a guy. And he was the dean. Talk about making 
the dean's team, not an A&M. It worked the other

05:18.805 --> 05:19.806
way. He didn't want anything to do. But anyway, 
here comes Bartrax and puts him up on stage.

05:26.818 --> 05:30.504
Somebody says, let's hear it for Dean Bolton. And 
Dean, Dean, Dean, he gave a yell. And so I said to

05:35.051 --> 05:43.865
Dean, Dean, the way this flu is bad, we have decided 
we're going to, the school's coming to an end. And

05:43.886 --> 05:46.710
he said, well, let's talk this over. And Dean, we 
have decided we're going home tomorrow. We're

05:50.187 --> 05:53.611
going back to our outfits now and tell everybody to 
pack and go home. And that was that. Went back to my

05:57.396 --> 06:00.299
outside. Got the first sergeant in the house. 
Let's get all the juniors out. And we got, we met

06:06.707 --> 06:12.033
with them, said, pass the word, we're leaving. 
School's out. And we left.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.505
All right, to the important part. That was pretty 
important. When you talk about insurrection now,

06:21.527 --> 06:24.731
that was not insurrection. It just was an 
assumption of authority, and Bartrax Bolton and

06:24.751 --> 06:30.058
T.O. Walton were smart enough to know that if the 
senior class had decided that. The better. Well,

06:36.066 --> 06:38.909
that caused me to bounce back to academics. How 
common was it that somebody cheated? Well, I

06:42.834 --> 06:44.076
suppose it happened. But was it common? Not to my 
knowledge. Did you all have test files or anything

06:48.529 --> 06:53.694
like that of old tests? I never saw one. Never. Nor 
did I ever hear of one becoming available. Never.

07:02.302 --> 07:07.147
But you don't remember any stunts where somebody 
got a copy of a test or anything like that? Never

07:07.247 --> 07:08.508
came to my attention. I've not heard of it. I might 
have been delighted to have a copy of it, but no. I

07:15.473 --> 07:22.623
never really, I don't believe, I can't say that it 
didn't happen because I have no recollection of it

07:15.473 --> 07:22.623
ever having happened. As you look back, were there 
some courses you now believe were more important

07:22.643 --> 07:28.392
to your future than others? Oh, I think so. I think 
so. The fact of the matter is, a great deal that

07:31.696 --> 07:40.169
prepared me for my turning out to be a trial lawyer. 
I tried lawsuits for 47 years. was that I debated.

07:47.010 --> 07:49.913
A&M was a nothing in debating when I got there. And a 
senior in I went over to Austin, and when I was a

07:51.295 --> 07:58.963
freshman, we won the Southwest Congress debating 
championship. It was a first for A&M to even be

07:58.983 --> 08:03.507
there, much less to win it. Who was there, was there 
a particular important coach or teacher? A fellow

08:07.792 --> 08:12.196
in the English department was sort of the sponsor, 
but C.O. Spriggs was in there. We called him

08:14.030 --> 08:17.073
Cosine, Cosine Spriggs. S-P-R-I-G-G-S? Yes. And 
his C-O was initial, so C-O-S, and we called him

08:19.796 --> 08:23.159
Cosine. Cosine, right. Cosine Spriggs. And he had 
a fellow whose name I can't remember. So did you do

08:28.364 --> 08:30.066
that for all four years? No, we only debated for two 
years. Then intercollegiate debating became

08:33.809 --> 08:42.838
sort of passe, and it went to what they call 
roundtable, discussion type things. And we did

08:43.274 --> 08:46.497
have a round table club at A&M. And I started it in my 
junior year, but it didn't last. We debated Oxford

08:53.524 --> 08:59.991
on the campus over in the physics theater. And the 
place was jammed. And it was joke telling. That's

09:03.895 --> 09:05.336
the way the English debated. It was very light. 
They'd announce the subject and then very rarely

09:07.258 --> 09:12.403
touch on it. It was a, I spent a lot of time in the 
library researching on the subjects. Describe

09:20.389 --> 09:22.070
Cushing Library. Well of course it was a grand old 
place and the librarian was Tommy Mayo and he used

09:22.090 --> 09:31.958
to call me cousin. Did class rank matter in the 
library? I don't believe so. If you were studying?

09:44.176 --> 09:47.281
Okay, the important questions now. What did it 
mean to you that you went to Texas A&M as you look

09:48.202 --> 09:53.110
back on your life?

09:57.657 --> 10:01.202
A little history. I was 12, 13 years old.

10:07.191 --> 10:11.618
I was sitting on a curb in the 400 block of South 
Adams. And I was 12, 13 years old, under a street

10:12.712 --> 10:17.958
light. It was summertime. And I looked around. The 
fellas that I played ball with, we wound up being

10:23.764 --> 10:31.752
the high school baseball

10:23.764 --> 10:31.752
team. I can remember that the pitcher, his name was 
Patterson, his father sold peanut patties, not

10:31.772 --> 10:39.360
peanut brittle. They were as big as, and they were 
just peanut patties, sugar with peanuts in them.

10:47.256 --> 10:48.718
Some of the men were unemployed. There just wasn't 
much. And I thought to myself, and I give God the

10:53.145 --> 10:59.875
credit for this, Mel, you've got to get out of here. 
Now, you're an American. This just evolves over

11:02.378 --> 11:04.361
time. You're entitled to a chance. And that's all 
you got coming to you is a chance. And I got on that

11:11.433 --> 11:13.995
train and went to College Station. And I went to see 
E.E. McQuillan.

11:20.742 --> 11:25.227
And A&M gave me a chance to get a college education. 
And I am in their debt. I will never be able to repay

11:29.311 --> 11:30.992
it. I have tried in every way. I'm a founding member 
of the President's Endowed Scholarship Program.

11:38.673 --> 11:44.583
I have provided an athletic scholarship for I just 
don't know how long. I am a member of the associates

11:46.266 --> 11:49.832
program. I am a member of the heritage program. And 
just A&M, I teach a lot of Bible classes. And I tell

12:00.970 --> 12:02.773
them, I say, the most important things in my life 
are easily spelled out for you. First of all, God is

12:08.034 --> 12:11.738
the most important person to me. Then my next most 
important is my family. And then not my church, but

12:16.203 --> 12:19.906
A&M. Then the church in there close. And I just, A&M 
gave me a chance. I think that the

12:31.812 --> 12:36.596
Those were four preparatory years that provide 
you with... I never had any trouble studying in law

12:36.817 --> 12:41.341
school. I never had any trouble with the 
discipline in the Army. I liked it. I liked it. I

12:48.247 --> 12:56.394
remember from my junior ROTC days in junior high 
school reading a manual on military courtesy and

12:48.247 --> 12:56.394
discipline.

12:59.457 --> 13:01.819
Military discipline is the willful and cheerful 
obedience to orders. Now that sort of fits God as

13:06.761 --> 13:09.065
well. If you love me, he says, keep my 
commandments. It's the willful and cheerful

13:14.053 --> 13:16.918
obedience to orders. I've never forgotten it. So I 
was able to work under lawyers, learn things from

13:19.021 --> 13:24.170
them. I was a distinguished law student, a C-plus 
student at A&M. The high man on the bar exam, 194

13:30.638 --> 13:34.902
others took it, beat me three points. And when I 
came out and I lost school, I got a chance. I got a

13:44.471 --> 13:45.212
chance. And that was the second chance that I got. 
And A&M gave me the first one. And I tell people, I

13:53.620 --> 13:56.983
said I was born American and born white. I started 
out ahead of everybody else that was not American

13:57.689 --> 14:01.974
and was not white. And there's just no question 
about it. White man has had an advantage over the

14:06.059 --> 14:10.584
black man from the beginning. So I just feel ever so 
grateful. I really have a grateful heart. I might

14:18.674 --> 14:25.001
have been or not been a lot of things, but always 
been grateful. I have a grateful heart to God. and

14:28.013 --> 14:30.143
to my family and to A&M.
