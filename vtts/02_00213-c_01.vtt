WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:10.030
include all of the key core staff? Well, core 
block, they go out and then they have elections to

00:10.632 --> 00:18.293
see who and their friends vote. to see who gets an 
interview. The people in their class vote, and the

00:20.917 --> 00:25.986
top three vote getters go to an interview process. 
And inside the interview process, then they

00:26.687 --> 00:31.675
interview with people such as core staff, stuff 
like that. So in the interview process, there are

00:36.008 --> 00:43.836
the key people within the Corps Commander, Deputy 
Corps Commander, someone's from Parcel Mountain

00:36.008 --> 00:43.836
Cavalry, someone's from Ross Volunteers, stuff 
like that. So I'm in the band. Did it cost in that

00:45.037 --> 00:49.822
campaign for your senior yell leader, did that 
cost some money? It cost money both years. Where'd

00:51.924 --> 00:53.705
you raise the money? Credit cards and my parents. 
So you didn't raise money from other people? No, I

00:57.889 --> 00:58.650
did not. What would be the guesstimate of what? A 
lot. $1,000? More. My junior year, probably five.

01:06.373 --> 01:06.673
Really? Yeah, but that's taking into account 
everything. That's taking into account cell

01:09.157 --> 01:18.428
phone bills, gas, I mean food for the people who 
helped out, the gifts that I got them when it was all

01:09.157 --> 01:18.428
done for helping out, stuff like that. It was less 
my senior year just because I didn't have to work as

01:18.869 --> 01:21.753
hard my senior year. I already had name 
recognition. I already had all that kind of stuff.

01:25.938 --> 01:31.345
In the campaign, the two years, is there anything 
you did that if you were doing it now you wouldn't

01:25.938 --> 01:31.345
do? Anything that you realize was an error in 
judgment or ethics? No, there really is not. Maybe

01:40.855 --> 01:49.528
something I'd do different is when I'd go speak, I 
would say a lot more than what I did, especially my

01:40.855 --> 01:49.528
senior year. Sometimes I wanted to play PC too 
much. Does that make sense? I didn't want to offend

01:55.116 --> 02:00.083
anyone, so I'd keep some of the stuff that I wanted 
to say just to myself just because that's fine.

02:00.564 --> 02:05.331
Looking back on it, I kind of wish I would have said 
some stuff that would have maybe alleviated some

02:00.564 --> 02:05.331
problems that we've had. Did you keep the bright, 
the special green color? No, actually we didn't.

02:09.577 --> 02:15.456
We changed it and the campaign kind of took on a 
different, kind of different feel to it that year.

02:15.892 --> 02:17.574
Completely new people helped out. It was a new 
group of people. And that year was all about, it was

02:19.857 --> 02:25.203
so funny, it's almost like we started an 
organization. And we called it Random Steps.

02:28.667 --> 02:35.655
Because everyone that helped out was all about 
people opening up amongst themselves, not trying

02:28.667 --> 02:35.655
to become new people. Does that make sense? Like 
take steps personally. And so, I mean, everything

02:39.300 --> 02:45.527
from taking random trips to Austin on a Tuesday 
night when we shouldn't have. um to just anything

02:45.507 --> 03:08.022
and so what we ended up doing was uh that kind of 
became what it was and it became like best friends

02:45.507 --> 03:08.022
like they're probably two marriages are coming 
out of it out of the people and they didn't know each

02:45.507 --> 03:08.022
other before the before the campaign started and 
now two people will probably end up getting

02:45.507 --> 03:08.022
married um out of that best friendships roommates 
A bunch of stuff. So you had no opponent? Well, we

03:14.686 --> 03:16.849
had opponents, but not from the Corps. Not from the 
Corps cadets. And your margin of victory was?

03:24.980 --> 03:31.129
Bubba and I, the guy that I reigned with, we set 
records for the most votes that anyone has ever

03:24.980 --> 03:31.129
gotten at A&M. Was he a civilian or a Corps? No, he 
was Corps. He got 40 more votes than I did, and...

03:38.444 --> 03:42.169
We, he got 8,000 and I got right under 8,000. And 
that is, we beat, the next closest person got

03:42.310 --> 03:47.116
2,000. So the margin of victory was substantial. 
And of the five elected, were you the only

03:50.441 --> 03:56.390
civilian? Once again, I was the only civilian. And 
then you go before the? Go before the board and

04:02.078 --> 04:03.760
interview. And that board was there much 
difference in the background of the interview

04:04.617 --> 04:14.247
board in terms of core civilian or whatever? It was 
all over. I mean it was appointed by the student

04:15.948 --> 04:19.852
body president and so there were people from all 
over. A true variety. It was a true variety. It sure

04:22.195 --> 04:22.695
was. Did anybody either during the campaign or 
during the interview process come to you and try to

04:23.536 --> 04:30.883
get you to promise to do this, that or the other? Not 
really. Honestly, I mean, just because if you look

04:33.220 --> 04:37.465
at what yell leaders do, there's not a lot that we 
could promise. They could be like, promise to do

04:38.487 --> 04:41.190
more yells, and we'll be like, okay, we'll do more 
yells. You know, I mean, there's not, there's

04:41.230 --> 04:46.096
really nothing, not really. Nobody asks you to 
come to the fraternity and sorority houses more or

04:46.116 --> 04:53.866
do this and Duncan more or anything. No. And... 
then how did you learn you had been selected as the

04:56.052 --> 05:00.158
head yell leader? We go through the interview 
process, and the three senior yell leaders who got

05:00.678 --> 05:09.250
interviewed, we would go up to Dr. Sutherland's 
office, and Dr. Sutherland would tell us who got

05:00.678 --> 05:09.250
it. All three at the same time? All three at the same 
time, and Rusty Thompson, who was our advisor, all

05:10.372 --> 05:14.838
four of us would be up there, and then Dr. 
Sutherland would tell us. And it was weird, just

05:16.040 --> 05:22.609
because I never, I mean, no civilian has ever been a 
head yell leader before. When you went in to that

05:23.310 --> 05:25.333
meeting, You knew that the announcement was going 
to occur then? Yeah. What were your thoughts? My

05:31.263 --> 05:35.053
thoughts were, don't worry about it. It's not a big 
deal. You're going to have fun next year. Think

05:38.156 --> 05:39.818
about all the extra time you're going to have. Just 
because a junior yell leader is much more time

05:40.920 --> 05:45.305
consuming than just a regular senior yell leader. 
A head yell leader's time is much more, a lot more

05:45.766 --> 05:51.012
time consuming than just a junior yell leader. 
But, so I was just like, man, I was trying to be

05:51.733 --> 05:54.917
positive. I was just like, just because I knew, I 
was like there's no way that they're going to give a

05:55.157 --> 06:00.384
non-reg head yell leader. It's just not going to 
happen. Did he say anything unusual in making the

06:02.166 --> 06:05.310
announcement? When he first started, about five 
minutes into his talk, I was like, I think I started

06:05.881 --> 06:11.208
Yell Leader. Just because what he was talking on. 
He was talking on changes within the Yell Leader

06:13.992 --> 06:26.169
organization and how they dealt with that and how 
when changes happened that it turned out to be some

06:13.992 --> 06:26.169
of the strongest years of Yell Leaders when the 
changes happened. So when that happened, when he

06:27.571 --> 06:32.277
said that, I was just like, wow, something 
happened. All right, so the announcement is made,

06:33.067 --> 06:44.921
and then did anyone then pull you aside in any 
manner and give you advice, guidance, counsel?

06:45.842 --> 06:47.544
Not really, to be honest with you. I think they were 
very upset that I won, they being the core yell

06:48.165 --> 06:53.311
leaders. They were upset that I won. Were they 
outwardly pleasant? No, not at first, not the

06:59.290 --> 07:02.794
first week, not the first two weeks. They weren't 
at all. Last year's head yell leader didn't talk to

07:06.600 --> 07:10.865
me for about two weeks, wouldn't return my phone 
calls. Really? And then when we actually sat down

07:12.928 --> 07:20.438
and talked, he was very visibly upset and even 
angry at times.

07:21.835 --> 07:24.439
for weird reasons, and it worked out fine. I mean, 
everything, in the end, everything's fine. But I

07:28.204 --> 07:30.647
remember being upset about that. I mean, I was hurt 
by that. But. All right, then, as you go back, you go

07:34.072 --> 07:43.205
out of that first, that announcement, what were 
your guidelines that you personally adopted? Oh,

07:44.266 --> 07:44.907
man.

07:48.835 --> 08:16.767
never judge before i never judge never make a 
preconceived notion before you know everything

07:48.835 --> 08:16.767
were you determined to be non-prejudicial to the 
corps and the corps members um i was determined to

07:48.835 --> 08:16.767
be completely fair i was determined to be 
completely fair um in my opinion no one deserved

07:48.835 --> 08:16.767
more than someone else until they proved to me that 
they deserved more than anyone else Until someone

08:17.945 --> 08:21.249
shows me that they're capable of more, I'm not 
going to give them more. And were you determined

08:22.790 --> 08:31.820
that in doing anything with the Corps that you were 
not going to say, okay, buddies, I'll show you

08:22.790 --> 08:31.820
guys? Oh, of course not. No, I think that's one of 
the reasons why I might have gotten it. It's

08:35.344 --> 08:36.465
because that was never an issue. I did my job as my 
job was prescribed to me, not how I thought the job

08:36.966 --> 08:42.872
should be run. All right, so then last summer, 
what? Last summer was first jail. I mean, I ate and

08:50.159 --> 08:54.346
braved that thing simply because Bill Cosby was 
the entertainer. That's a whole lot of money Bill

08:54.887 --> 08:58.352
Cosby cost. And so that was amazing, just having to 
put that together. And throughout that time, my

09:04.422 --> 09:06.946
girlfriend and I had broken up. And so personally, 
that was a really rough time just because we were

09:06.966 --> 09:11.914
going through all that. Instead of breaking up 
with my girlfriend and really kind of

09:13.345 --> 09:28.385
re-evaluating who I was, re-evaluating my 
relationship with Christ, re-evaluating all

09:13.345 --> 09:28.385
that, I kind of went the other way and started 
having fun, per se, which I kind of regret now. But

09:28.866 --> 09:32.451
it was good to do it, I guess, just because I learned 
a lot. Was part of the problem of the breakup the

09:32.819 --> 09:37.649
stress of the activities, you reckon? Sort of, 
possibly. Because it was right before

09:39.372 --> 09:42.157
campaigning started. And I was just, the whole 
stress of everything, I just started to wonder if I

09:43.059 --> 09:48.550
wanted to even do it anymore.

09:52.360 --> 10:17.541
everything was like that like do I want to be a 
theater arts major like I started questioning

09:52.360 --> 10:17.541
everything so it was just kind of this I need to find 
myself I need to find who I am so you were you here all

09:52.360 --> 10:17.541
summer I was here all summer where'd you live I 
lived in a house over off 2818 and then when the fall

09:52.360 --> 10:17.541
semester began you moved to the campus yes back to 
Hart Hall Hart Hall I lived in Hart Hall in the fall.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.786
What was it like to live in Hart Hall? It was great, 
man. It was so neat just because I always got the

10:21.948 --> 10:27.376
weird look. I always got the strange look. I always 
got the what you live where. I'm really into the

10:30.420 --> 10:32.703
strange looks that I get from people. Like, I'm a 
theater arts major, so I'm liberal arts, so I need

10:32.804 --> 10:36.329
to take a language. I'm taking ancient Greek as my 
language. Exactly. I love that look. I love the

10:40.695 --> 10:42.518
look of people going... I don't know necessarily 
why I do, but I just... I don't know. It's not that I

10:48.913 --> 10:56.342
love being different, per se, because I don't try 
to be different, but I loved living in Hart, and I

10:48.913 --> 10:56.342
love the stuff that I got living in Hart. I love 
getting made fun of it. Because it's on

10:58.384 --> 10:59.325
air-conditioned. Because it's on 
air-conditioned, because my rooms weren't this

10:59.345 --> 11:03.791
big. Everybody opens their window, so the wind 
was... You do know that long years ago, that was the

11:04.091 --> 11:11.059
athletic dorm. Oh, yeah. I remember. I sure do. 
Then classes began and first yell. Classes began,

11:16.411 --> 11:17.693
first yell. Did you get to meet Bill Cosby? I did. 
Actually, I got to meet Bill Cosby. What was your

11:21.799 --> 11:22.479
impression? Describe Bill. Bill Cosby is the 
ultimate entertainer. He is the entertainer.

11:28.147 --> 11:28.908
It's amazing. Sitting in the room, like when I was 
in there and Rusty Thompson, our advisor, would be

11:29.268 --> 11:34.836
in there and he'd be signing stuff for us. He'd just 
kind of be there. I mean, he'd be talking a little

11:35.997 --> 11:39.762
bit, but he would be talking very much like you and I 
are talking right now. Not a big deal. But then

11:40.968 --> 11:46.055
someone would come in, like he's real big into 
helping mentally challenged people and stuff

11:40.968 --> 11:46.055
like that. Real, like he's really heavily 
involved in that. And so some of the, some, there

11:49.119 --> 11:55.769
was a girl who loves Bill Cosby who is mentally 
challenged here in the Bryant College Station

11:49.119 --> 11:55.769
area. And she came into the room. And right when she 
came into the room, I mean the switch went on. And he

12:00.275 --> 12:02.158
was Dr. Huxtable. I mean he was Bill Cosby that you 
hear on radio, that you see on TV. And she left, and

12:07.225 --> 12:10.248
he was just, I mean, just sat down. He was just very 
tired looking. I mean, the man's 70 years old. And

12:13.611 --> 12:21.838
he did not, in his presentation, did not do or even 
hint at a thing that was inappropriate. Never was.

12:22.519 --> 12:23.720
That was in bad taste or anything. That's what I 
thought. Never was. And that's another thing, is

12:25.301 --> 12:28.104
right beforehand, he was so tired. But then he hit 
the, I mean, it was just, oh, man, just on. I mean,

12:32.188 --> 12:34.109
right when he walked out that curtain, it was on. 
Then right when he got off stage... Was he

12:36.875 --> 12:38.341
courteous to everyone? Very courteous. Oh, he 
took every picture that anyone wanted to take. He

12:41.493 --> 12:43.501
signed everything that anyone wanted to sign. All 
that stuff. It was great. So, all right, as head

12:47.219 --> 12:52.785
yell leader, what were some of the high points and 
low points, if there were any for you? Some of the

12:54.127 --> 12:57.591
high points were just getting to be involved with 
what I got to be involved in. Something that I've

12:58.232 --> 13:03.758
learned throughout my time as head yell leader is 
that I love to be on the in. Does that make sense? To

13:04.939 --> 13:05.380
be what? And on the in, be the one that someone calls 
if they need something. On the in, I-N. Yeah, be on

13:10.085 --> 13:13.251
the in, I guess you could say. Being on a first name 
basis with Dr. Sutherland. You know, the fact that

13:16.978 --> 13:19.423
every time I see him, he makes fun of me. You know, 
that type of stuff. I enjoy that. I do. And so that

13:23.711 --> 13:25.715
was a really neat thing. High point for just as far 
as Yale leader goes, seeing First Yale happen. and

13:32.056 --> 13:37.583
that getting done, and realizing that it was a 
success, not only that it worked, but also

13:32.056 --> 13:37.583
financially, we made a lot of money. As far as you 
know, it's continuing. And it's continuing. And I

13:40.967 --> 13:49.738
think that that's, and it's really, it's a really 
neat thing to know that we were in on the beginning

13:40.967 --> 13:49.738
of that, those five of us, that sat in that room and 
said, okay, if we're going to do this, then we need

13:40.967 --> 13:49.738
to do it. And then seeing it happen. Any low 
moments? Disappointments?

13:59.883 --> 14:00.724
Times, yeah. I mean, just problems with 
friendships again. I mean, I was even busier this

14:04.730 --> 14:09.757
semester, this past fall, than I was this semester 
before. So a lot of friendships were fading. There

14:12.521 --> 14:14.884
was times in which I didn't like my living 
situation. The guy I was living with was a

14:15.445 --> 14:16.987
sophomore. I was having problems with other 
friends. I wasn't with my girlfriend, obviously.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.018
I got myself into some situations with girls that 
were bad. Not anything serious or anything, but

14:25.499 --> 14:27.882
just... If I had it all over again, I wouldn't do it 
simply because of just the emotion that had to be

14:28.807 --> 14:36.664
put forth to appease the situation. So that wasn't 
good. Now, through all of these stressful times,

14:39.490 --> 14:48.891
sometimes stressful times, to whom did you turn 
for advice, for counseling?

14:53.343 --> 14:55.667
Different people, honestly. The person that 
first came to my mind was my girlfriend, Kate. Even

15:00.455 --> 15:03.680
when we weren't together, if I was having a bad 
time, I'd call her. And she'd always listen.

15:05.283 --> 15:09.750
Another one is Dr. Welch, Ben Welch, who was the 
advisor to the Aggie Men's Club. We eat breakfast

15:11.193 --> 15:15.520
every Thursday morning at 7 o'clock in the 
morning. He and whoever else wants to come, but

15:16.242 --> 15:18.966
it's usually just me and him. And that is, that's 
just, he's just an amazing sounding board. What

15:25.195 --> 15:26.576
about academic advice? What to take or what not to 
take? Just my fellow students, my fellow theater

15:31.804 --> 15:34.367
art students, really. Now, you and your friends 
register on the machine. It's on the phone. On the

15:39.795 --> 15:41.577
phone, okay. And how long does that take? Oh my 
gosh, my freshman year it took until about 2.15 in

15:42.719 --> 15:45.523
the morning. Now it doesn't take that long just 
because I'm older. You know the routine. I know the

15:51.988 --> 15:53.170
routine a little better. How do you avoid taking 
the wrong course? Gas, man. Like really what it is

15:59.279 --> 16:03.906
is you sign up for stuff and then you realize what 
you're in and then you go talk to an advisor. I talk

16:04.567 --> 16:08.553
to my advisors a lot, see what courses I need, see 
what I don't.

16:11.357 --> 16:13.620
Do you have a long-range career goal yet? I've got a 
pretty good idea of some. What is it? I would

16:18.129 --> 16:18.770
like... I don't know, to be honest with you. I know 
that I like the arts. I enjoy acting. I love being on

16:26.342 --> 16:27.283
stage. I love that type of stuff. I love building 
sets, and I love that. But then I also love... I got

16:34.113 --> 16:39.040
to go to the inauguration this year for George W. I 
love that. I love politics. I love... I love having

16:43.182 --> 16:45.985
a cause and defending it. I'm not saying that 
politics is something that I'm going to be in, but

16:47.106 --> 16:52.011
it very well could be. Politics is something that 
I'm in. And your major today is? Theater arts.

16:55.595 --> 16:55.976
Theater arts. And I have a minor in business. And 
you're graduating when? Next May. And... What am I

17:02.603 --> 17:04.185
going to do? What are you going to do? Oh, gosh. I 
have no idea. My parents have a lot of contacts in

17:08.765 --> 17:13.171
Washington right now simply because of who's 
there. I could go get a job in Washington. They've

17:15.074 --> 17:20.341
already told me that, that I could go get work in 
Washington for a while, maybe even in the White

17:15.074 --> 17:20.341
House. I agree. Stuff I thought about. As you look 
at this campus today, how are the co-eds treated?

17:30.915 --> 17:32.657
Very well, I think. Are they, you think, given 
equality? I believe so. I believe so. If you go over

17:38.142 --> 17:45.959
to student government and if you go to the MSC and if 
you go to stuff like that, women are doing just as

17:38.142 --> 17:45.959
much as men are and sometimes even more. If you look 
at Fish Camp, the organization of Fish Camp, there

17:46.260 --> 17:52.373
are always, always a majority of people that help 
out women. and that's very, that's looked well

17:53.146 --> 17:55.829
upon. If you look at administrators, yes, top 
administrators are still males, simply because

17:55.849 --> 18:07.601
of, and this is nothing against y'all, simply 
because of the age in which the males are, simply

17:55.849 --> 18:07.601
because the administrators are now 50s, 60s. Most 
women who are in 50 and 60 didn't get the education

18:08.221 --> 18:12.726
to support that. But I say in the next 20 years, a 
majority of the, I wouldn't say majority, but I'd

18:13.046 --> 18:19.272
say a very equal part of the administrators on this 
campus will be women. I mean, just like Dr.

18:19.673 --> 18:21.955
Winterford, Cindy Lawson, people like that. 
There are people in key positions on campus that

18:24.518 --> 18:27.801
make big time decisions. And so I think that it's 
coming around. Probably slower here than other

18:31.225 --> 18:35.369
places, but I think it's coming around. What about 
minorities? Minorities, it's a funny thing.

18:41.255 --> 18:45.159
Minorities aren't, it's different here than 
other places. I think it's open to them, but the

18:45.259 --> 18:49.984
minority has to be very open as well. Does that make 
sense? The minority person can't come in here with

18:51.365 --> 18:56.793
a chip on the shoulder because a chip is just going 
to be given right back to them. But someone who is

18:57.875 --> 19:05.206
open, like Boo-Boo, like a Ronnie McDonald, like 
my friend Sko Maps, he's African-American.

19:07.690 --> 19:10.535
If they're open, then there's nothing that's 
going to be done. What about Asian? Asian, I have

19:13.560 --> 19:18.267
another friend who was just an exec on a... And a 
student organization, big MSC hospitality, very

19:18.668 --> 19:25.395
big student organization, he could probably do 
anything he wanted in student government. I think

19:25.875 --> 19:27.457
that it's relatively open. But I think a big part of 
it is, and this stinks, but it's on their part. And

19:32.702 --> 19:36.085
what they are, are they going to subscribe to the 
same things that we hold dear? Because if they try

19:36.566 --> 19:43.933
and come and change the system, then obviously we 
aren't, we wouldn't have that even if a, I mean if a

19:36.566 --> 19:43.933
Caucasian came in and did that. make believe that I 
didn't know anything about the student body in

19:44.437 --> 19:49.183
general here. Geographically, where do Aggie 
undergraduates come from? Texas. Big towns,

19:56.131 --> 19:57.933
small towns? I think it's half and half. Now, 
honestly, a lot of people come from the cities. A

20:04.261 --> 20:06.063
lot of people come from Houston, Austin, Dallas. A 
lot of people. Are there still small towners?

20:09.287 --> 20:12.250
They're very small towners. in terms of attitudes 
a liberal conservative conservative very

20:12.652 --> 20:37.225
conservative but it's getting more liberal it's 
funny um i would say more liberal conservatism if

20:12.652 --> 20:37.225
that's if that's said um just because a lot of 
people they aren't die hard right-wing

20:12.652 --> 20:37.225
conservatives yet at the same time they aren't i 
think that's i think that's the biggest thing is

20:12.652 --> 20:37.225
that they're actually In my opinion, we have a much 
more open-minded campus than people would like to

20:38.386 --> 20:41.953
think. Maybe I'm just optimistic. As you have now 
finished four years, who are the people in key

20:44.398 --> 20:53.075
positions here that you most respect? I'm not 
going to ask the negative. That I most respect? I

20:57.163 --> 20:58.285
respect Cindy Lawson. Now, how do you know her? 
Through the bonfire stuff, and then just in the

21:01.915 --> 21:06.588
position that I've held these past couple years. I 
respect Winn Rosser, who works in the vice

21:07.330 --> 21:12.604
president's office for student affairs. What's 
his task? His task is pretty much to go wherever Dr.

21:15.612 --> 21:19.080
Sutherland goes and follow him around. But the 
thing about Dr. Rosser is that he never misses

21:19.120 --> 21:23.429
anything. He's kind of a chief of staff. Yeah. He 
doesn't miss a thing. Does not miss a thing. And

21:29.302 --> 21:30.405
it's really neat to see that. I respect Rusty 
Thompson, who is our advisor. Rusty has probably

21:34.327 --> 21:38.873
been much more than just an advisor. I mean, Rusty 
and I are gonna be close. Maybe it's just simply

21:41.035 --> 21:43.678
because of the stuff that we had to go through. But 
Rusty and I will be close probably for the rest of

21:44.139 --> 21:48.524
his life, at least I'd like to think so. I mean, 
there's more, but those are the ones that stick

21:49.446 --> 21:53.030
out. Mm-hm, mm-hm. If you were giving advice to the 
Head Yale leaders of the future, what advice would

21:55.954 --> 22:02.882
you give them? of yourself because you were put in 
the position by your friends. There's nothing

22:10.644 --> 22:13.228
that you did necessarily that put you in the 
position. There's everything that everyone else

22:13.268 --> 22:15.191
did. Be humble just because you don't deserve it 
necessarily. You were put there for a purpose. Be

22:25.547 --> 22:27.350
open-minded at all times. Don't think that just 
because that's how it was done in the past means

22:28.332 --> 22:31.637
that that's the right way to do it. before you make a 
decision, remove yourself from the situation,

22:33.828 --> 22:41.499
then think about what would be best for the student 
body as a whole, not just for the organization. If

22:43.021 --> 23:00.747
you had complete authority to make any changes in 
what we do in terms of athletic events and so forth,

22:43.021 --> 23:00.747
is there anything you would change? Any yells you 
would discontinue? Any songs you would modify or

23:04.011 --> 23:08.597
terminate?

23:12.982 --> 23:14.504
I can't think of any. I'm very happy with how stuff 
goes right now. If I could change anything, it'd be

23:16.927 --> 23:19.290
that we have a better basketball team. I mean, I 
would change certain things about the athletic

23:20.812 --> 23:23.916
teams themselves, but nothing. Nothing about the 
way in which we, as Aggies, support our teams. See,

23:27.236 --> 23:39.770
if I had dictator authority, and my notes don't go 
in the final version, of course, if I were the

23:27.236 --> 23:39.770
dictator, we would sing the other verse of the war 
hymn. That's a really funny thing that comes up.

23:42.873 --> 23:48.820
That's a funny talk because, I don't know, we get 
asked that a lot, about why don't we sing the first

23:42.873 --> 23:48.820
verse. And it's actually not the first verse. It's 
actually the second verse. Yeah, yeah. Yes, I

23:54.845 --> 23:57.934
mean, I don't think that would be a horrible thing 
to do. See, like when I was chancellor at Missouri

23:58.555 --> 24:03.790
and NM came up there and played, and this would have 
been 89 or 90.

24:06.859 --> 24:09.867
And here, playing at Missouri, you don't beat the 
hell out of... and goodbye to Texas University and

24:09.847 --> 24:18.017
the Missouri Crown was saying, gee, you know, 
these people are superb, but why are they singing

24:09.847 --> 24:18.017
that here? Well, it's just, I mean, what I tell 
people is we aren't seeing that thinking of Texas

24:18.478 --> 24:22.843
necessarily. I know it, yeah. You don't think of 
Texas necessarily. Maybe the first verse, I think

24:26.127 --> 24:29.771
that's something that might come up later. I 
remember a couple years ago a big push was done for

24:29.811 --> 24:33.436
that and it just didn't catch. I remember stories 
of them even passing out the words at Yale practice

24:33.456 --> 24:39.263
and people crumpling it up and throwing it back on 
the field. One thing that I've learned is that if

24:40.002 --> 24:45.369
the student body doesn't want it, then you're not 
going to do it. You're not going to do it. That's

24:46.691 --> 24:47.091
true. That's true.

24:53.860 --> 24:54.320
Let's see. Since you were in the Corps, you'd seen 
your boots. I wasn't in the Corps. Yeah, and you

24:59.026 --> 25:01.530
don't yet have a senior ring. I get that. I order 
this after the semester. How do you think you're

25:05.535 --> 25:07.377
going to feel when you put it on? I'm gonna feel 
good. I'm gonna feel real good. It's gonna be like a

25:12.184 --> 25:13.485
job well done. And is it a special thing you think? 
Yeah. I'm never gonna take it off. What creates

25:19.511 --> 25:23.054
Aggie spirit? Why is there the pride in this 
institution?

25:34.725 --> 25:37.347
It's a hard question to put words on.

25:40.381 --> 25:43.024
Are there some events that contribute to it? Of 
course, there's always events. I mean, with any

25:44.325 --> 25:57.199
culture that you have, there's going to be the 
rituals that you have that add to the culture, such

25:44.325 --> 25:57.199
as football games, such as yell practice, muster, 
silver taps, stuff like that, fish camp, yell

25:44.325 --> 25:57.199
leaders, reveille, stuff like that. The Corps of 
Cadets, I think, is a big thing that adds to that.

26:00.102 --> 26:05.848
The fact that we have something like that to do.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.545
A willingness to be part of it is what really does. 
Because anybody can come in here and you can shove

26:13.965 --> 26:19.697
the traditions down someone's throat, but if they 
don't want to be a part of them, then they're not

26:13.965 --> 26:19.697
going to mean anything. But the great thing about 
A&M is you get all these people that are willing to

26:20.058 --> 26:23.304
do it. Is A&M inclusive of people? Mm-hmm. if that 
person is willing, if that person is willing, if

26:29.234 --> 26:36.542
that person is willing to come in and be like, I'm 
not going to feel stupid when I do this. I will do

26:37.143 --> 26:40.527
this because the people before me did it. See, I 
believe that many outsiders think A&M is not

26:41.828 --> 26:46.814
inclusive. Yeah. I believe it's very inclusive. I 
believe it's very inclusive. In the interviews

26:49.757 --> 26:55.945
I've done with people back in the 30s and 40s, it 
didn't matter where you came from, what your daddy

26:49.757 --> 26:55.945
did. If you were a part of the group, And if you would 
join and do your part, well done. Like y'all don't

27:04.158 --> 27:05.720
give people nicknames. Everybody then had a 
nickname. And the nickname to an outsider seemed

27:08.242 --> 27:12.707
like a put down. But it wasn't. It was an 
identifier. Faculty all had nicknames. Like

27:18.893 --> 27:24.098
you've never heard of Cube Root Jackson or Square 
Root Jackson or Cube Root Kent. they taught two

27:24.078 --> 27:29.687
very, very key math courses that all engineers had 
to take. And the myth was that the courses were so

27:30.308 --> 27:39.083
hard that only the square root of the number of 
students taking the course would pass it. I can

27:39.923 --> 27:41.305
imagine. Then there was another guy, Dr. Dan, the 
grade point man, Dan Russell, over in rural

27:41.365 --> 27:47.131
sociology. And if you needed some grade points, 
you took one. You'd go there. And you knew it, and he

27:52.037 --> 27:53.318
knew it. He knew why you were there. So you think it 
is inclusive.

28:02.129 --> 28:07.635
Let's see, you've not been through a commencement 
yet, so that question doesn't... doesn't fit. At

28:10.235 --> 28:17.663
this point, what are you most proud about being a 
part of A&M?

28:20.646 --> 28:24.750
The fact that people are willing to do so much for 
this institution with no thank yous. I think the

28:27.172 --> 28:34.860
fact that we've got students and faculty that do 
stuff for A&M and not even all of them are Aggies. I

28:35.000 --> 28:36.542
mean, some of them aren't even Aggies.

28:39.138 --> 28:42.403
We have a very giving, giving culture. Are there 
some faculty members that have touched you? Some.

28:49.253 --> 28:49.694
Importantly? Some. Who? Arnold Kramer is one of 
them. Okay. Ben Welch is another. Rusty Thompson

28:55.443 --> 28:56.545
is one. Patricia Weiner is another one. 
W-E-H-N-E-R? Like the building. And what does she

29:02.664 --> 29:03.326
do? She is administrative helper for the 
Yalmeters Memorial Student Center. And the

29:11.058 --> 29:17.228
grades that you've earned here, do you think that 
in general you got what you deserve? Mm-hmm.

29:18.930 --> 29:19.371
Sometimes. Other times, I didn't have to go to 
class and I could get the A, so. That's right.

29:24.376 --> 29:24.777
Sometimes. I mean, it's just, it's very dependent 
on the class. I mean, there, there are obviously

29:26.659 --> 29:30.104
those teachers that are just like being the grade 
point man. There's, there are, there are still

29:30.124 --> 29:32.928
those here. If you were a consultant to A&M's 
leaders today, we brought you in to advise. What

29:41.700 --> 29:48.109
advice would you give them about how to guide A&M 
toward even greater Don't be hostile to the

29:48.764 --> 29:50.387
critic.

29:53.533 --> 29:53.853
I guess. Don't be hostile to the critic. Any other? 
Say

29:55.717 --> 29:59.363
thank you. Okay. Individual thank yous. Don't 
forget to do that. See, Jack Williams was superb.

30:10.706 --> 30:13.189
You got a personal note, handwritten. It only had 
three lines to it, but it was to you. That's great.

30:18.395 --> 30:19.876
Oh, of course you did. Of course you did. What about 
A&M's size? I want it bigger. Bigger? Mm-hmm. Can

30:28.326 --> 30:29.867
it remain personal? Mm-hmm. How would you select 
the students to be admitted?

30:40.668 --> 30:41.208
That's tough. I don't like the 10% rule. I don't 
like it. All right, what would you have as your

30:44.692 --> 30:47.355
guidelines? A lot of the same stuff that we have 
now, except it wouldn't be automatic for someone

30:49.197 --> 30:54.403
who's in the top 10%. Would you give? All right, I'm 
reading in.

31:01.411 --> 31:04.898
class rank plus ACTSAT. Sure. Class rank with a 
combination of grades but a combination of other

31:07.083 --> 31:10.410
stuff too. I think the great things that make A&M is 
that we don't just get students. We don't just get

31:14.037 --> 31:15.199
academics. We get people that are involved in 
other stuff. That's what makes A&M strong because

31:17.805 --> 31:21.833
someone can come through with their 2.7 which is a 
very Even grade point average, I mean, that's the

31:22.876 --> 31:27.964
average, but do amazing things on this campus. 
There are people that come through with 4.0 that

31:28.325 --> 31:32.632
never do anything except take grades, which is 
good. You need both. And so that's why I think I

31:33.854 --> 31:36.999
would just do away with the 10 percent rule. In my 
opinion, that would mean a lot more work for the

31:38.361 --> 31:40.604
admissions people. Well, and see, that's a state 
law, so. Oh, I know. But maybe it's going to be

31:45.172 --> 31:48.597
modified this year. All right, I've got only two 
other questions. What have we not talked about

31:52.407 --> 31:55.176
that we should have included? What

31:55.216 --> 32:01.759
have you thought of that, if anything?
