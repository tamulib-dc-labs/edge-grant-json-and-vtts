WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:11.789
When you consider his closeness with the 
congressman, the state senator, that one was

00:02.174 --> 00:11.789
shaky from time to time. But nevertheless, when it 
comes down to the nitty-gritty, they were usually

00:11.929 --> 00:19.501
together, maybe after some arguments. But the 
president, the congressman, the governor, the

00:20.302 --> 00:28.975
state representatives, nearly always, I don't 
think we'll ever see a pattern like that again. I

00:33.352 --> 00:36.878
mean, it was like a maroon umbrella. And I 
understand that Mr. Rudder and Jake Pickle,

00:39.002 --> 00:44.472
Congressman Austin, their friendship went back 
many years. Yeah, way back to Austin. And I think

00:47.698 --> 00:49.742
Mrs. Rudder, actually had as much or more contact 
with Jake because of social connections. I think

00:57.461 --> 00:58.022
so. I think more than President Rutter did, but 
they loved each other too. It's

01:03.734 --> 01:09.146
nearly as if God had intervened. There was no 
school. you remember how excited we were about the

01:14.180 --> 01:42.921
first astronauts Teague was chairman of the house 
national aeronautics and space committee and we

01:14.180 --> 01:42.921
had who were those first ones John Glenn and 
Shepard maybe yeah anytime their name really went

01:14.180 --> 01:42.921
up in lights the next thing you know Teague had them 
here and we were having our students were exposed

01:43.272 --> 02:09.178
to that kind of greatness way before anybody else 
ever dreamed of it and because it was because of the

01:43.272 --> 02:09.178
team rudder really and we had werner von braun uh 
that that was the most exciting thing to me in the

01:43.272 --> 02:09.178
jobs i've had here both as an assistant to rudder 
and williams and then and with com with

01:43.272 --> 02:09.178
commencement ceremonies I could write a list of 
people that I it's been my good fortune just to be

02:10.188 --> 02:21.523
around a little bit just because of what those men 
amounted to their reputations. One of the things I

02:21.543 --> 02:36.702
wish we had done started way way way back there 
would have been to have had all of the commencement

02:21.543 --> 02:36.702
speakers sign a program and put that in a file of 
some sort it would make a good display because it

02:36.682 --> 03:00.732
really would have let's see Connolly on 
commencement speakers just there have been three

02:36.682 --> 03:00.732
that I know of that I can remember that were so good 
in their own style that they were invited twice

02:36.682 --> 03:00.732
John Connolly was one

03:02.264 --> 03:03.847
Abner McCall was one. President of Baylor. 
Baylor. And was it the writer from Houston that Dr.

03:06.591 --> 03:12.301
Williams loved so much? Yes. He was here twice. 
Yes. I can't think of his name, but he was so clever

03:15.266 --> 03:17.790
and so good. Yes. And he was a UT graduate, but He 
could tell an Aggie story and then it would turn

03:22.447 --> 03:28.601
around and it would be a tea sipper story. He was 
that good. Back to that period of change, I have

03:30.966 --> 03:40.067
heard an anecdote that Senator Moore and 
President Rutter on certain evenings ten o'clock

03:41.262 --> 03:59.727
or so would accidentally encounter each other in 
their cars in the parking lot of the campus theater

03:41.262 --> 03:59.727
and they would talk politics there without anyone 
else knowing about it have you ever heard that

03:41.262 --> 03:59.727
story no have not I don't know whether it was true or 
not but the supposedly that because if

03:59.909 --> 04:24.938
I'm not mistaken part of those big discussions 
came when Senator Moore was running for

03:59.909 --> 04:24.938
reelection and Marion Pugh was running against 
him opposing those changes and so president

04:24.918 --> 04:42.640
rudder could easily have been caught in the middle 
of that during that campaign i'm not saying that

04:24.918 --> 04:42.640
these things didn't happen i'm just saying that 
you didn't that i either had forgotten it and and

04:24.918 --> 04:42.640
time is a factor now There are so many things that 
just barely come back to me now because it has been a

04:43.193 --> 04:48.360
long time. Well yeah we're almost at 40 years. Yes. 
Let's go back to the start. Did Mr. Rudder give you

04:56.592 --> 05:11.293
any in any manner any guidelines as to what your 
responsibilities were and what the do's and

04:56.592 --> 05:11.293
don'ts of being his assistant? uh there was never a 
job description and it was the kind of job where you

05:13.130 --> 05:36.640
served on a day-to-day basis once in a while 
there'd be a project that would extend out over

05:13.130 --> 05:36.640
time uh

05:36.974 --> 05:57.768
An example would be he was greatly concerned when 
the Corps was made non-compulsory, he was greatly

05:36.974 --> 05:57.768
concerned about student life activities for 
non-Corps students that would

05:36.974 --> 05:57.768
stimulate the same spirit that participation in 
the Corps would do. That's a very difficult

05:57.928 --> 05:59.691
challenge. But that's the one thing that he asked 
me to work on that was really a serious project. And

06:06.167 --> 06:13.674
to make a long story short, when I left his office, I 
became director of civilian student affairs. And

06:13.794 --> 06:25.966
really his charge to me was find ways where we can 
generate spirit among those students so they feel

06:13.794 --> 06:25.966
strong about God and country and Texas A&M like the 
core students do. And I did develop the outline for

06:27.768 --> 06:31.732
the first residence hall program. And he 
flinched. He didn't like anything that cost

06:33.153 --> 06:35.035
money. He was tight. And he flinched when I gave him 
my first report, and it called for, it seemed like,

06:38.439 --> 06:54.294
oh, $65,000 to set up some residence halls on a 
trial basis with resident advisors on every

06:38.439 --> 06:54.294
floor. And that was way more than that. but he he 
went along and said we'll try it and now uh a lot of

06:57.097 --> 07:18.953
people don't know I was involved as much as I was in 
that program but that was that was my that was my

06:57.097 --> 07:18.953
answer to what he was shooting for uh your basic 
question is I would go into his office or he would

06:57.097 --> 07:18.953
come into mine every morning and there would be two 
or three things on his mind that he wanted me to

07:20.587 --> 07:47.792
check out for him find out how the wind is blowing on 
this or that it might be a construction project

07:20.587 --> 07:47.792
there was just no pattern to it he'd say well so and 
so is saying this I hear see what you can find out so

07:20.587 --> 07:47.792
it was kind of like being a fireman though there 
were ongoing projects that extended over time

07:48.363 --> 08:05.106
most of it was going in and finding out what was on 
his mind that day and I had what I call I had two

07:48.363 --> 08:05.106
manila folders one was a happy file and one was a mad 
file And I could read him like a book after a while.

08:10.062 --> 08:12.646
And I knew what to bring up and what not to bring up. 
And if he was in a good mood, you could get nearly

08:13.808 --> 08:18.013
anything through. If he was in a bad mood about 
something, you just better keep your mouth shut if

08:18.614 --> 08:25.864
there was any controversy involved with it. When 
you began, describe the office staff. Who else was

08:30.511 --> 08:34.496
there working in the president's office? 
Geraldine Hott. was the

08:37.672 --> 08:41.800
secretary. She was good. She'd been there for a 
while. Nella Rowell came in. I

08:47.571 --> 08:56.608
can't remember the sequence. But she came in. I was 
the only assistant at first. That grew a little bit

09:04.813 --> 09:07.257
later. As

09:08.819 --> 09:20.677
I recall, we had no graduate assistants. I don't 
think we had any student employees. Now, when I was

09:23.742 --> 09:26.646
William's assistant, I did have an idea that we 
should come up with a title of staff assistant not

09:27.959 --> 09:54.895
assistant to and get people like

09:27.959 --> 09:54.895
Roger Miller and Gary Morrow and Kent Caperton to 
come in and work and see how these things work

09:27.959 --> 09:54.895
because my strategy was that these boys are going 
places and they're going to be high places And if

09:55.718 --> 10:03.930
they have the insight that you can get only in this 
office, aren't we going to be better served in the

09:55.718 --> 10:03.930
years ahead? Well, one became a state senator, one 
became a land commissioner, one became the state

10:03.950 --> 10:10.160
controller. And, well, okay, that's on beyond 
rudder, though. He wouldn't have gone for that

10:15.479 --> 10:20.727
because that would have cost thousands of 
dollars. So it was a Spartan staff. He had his

10:25.374 --> 10:26.475
assistant.

10:28.979 --> 10:30.221
I had a secretary. Who was your secretary? I had 
Georgine Scafe, S-C-A-F-E, from Canada. who

10:43.897 --> 10:48.262
could interpret letters from his friends in 
France. That really pleased him. She was as good as

10:51.866 --> 10:54.750
I've ever had. And then I got... Well, I won't go 
into that one. I had one that was just absolutely

10:59.676 --> 11:03.420
terrible. But Georgene Scaife was the one most of 
the time, and she was just an absolute jewel.

11:11.549 --> 11:12.891
Describe... It was very small stuff. Describe Ms. 
Hott and Nelda Rowell. Describe them and their

11:20.038 --> 11:23.102
duties. Ms. Hott did the routine and things like 
making out his schedule and taking the first look

11:23.402 --> 11:41.865
at the mail that came in and deciding where it 
should go for his eyes only. And one of the things

11:42.554 --> 11:58.191
that I did, two things that I did for him that were 
pretty well developed as he tested me out, was that

11:42.554 --> 11:58.191
nearly every piece of mail that came in, I would 
draft his response. And I knew him well enough

11:59.612 --> 12:06.560
after a period of time that I could pretty well 
guess what he wanted to say and how he wanted to say

11:59.612 --> 12:06.560
it. And if I didn't quite hit it, He would go ahead 
and sign the letter. Come in. That's all right.

12:16.491 --> 12:17.052
Yeah, we're back. Talking about the things that I 
was doing. which relates back to an earlier

12:22.598 --> 12:49.770
question I would routinely do his correspondence 
which was considerable that would usually take at

12:22.598 --> 12:49.770
least half a day and a lot of it was stuff that you had 
to research you know finally well what is he saying

12:22.598 --> 12:49.770
this for and then try to just figure out and I could 
go to Geraldine Hott and say Jerry what do you think

12:22.598 --> 12:49.770
how would how do you think he'd feel on this and she 
could read him like a book she was very good and uh

12:50.392 --> 13:20.297
The other thing that I did was write his speeches, 
which was in

12:50.392 --> 13:20.297
my estimation,

12:50.392 --> 13:20.297
it probably gave him the ideas that he didn't have 
time to research the little angles that I had time

12:50.392 --> 13:20.297
to do. But I always dreaded to do a speech for him 
because

13:21.070 --> 13:37.514
if he read it and didn't have time to get it in his 
mind and do at least part of it extemporaneously,

13:21.070 --> 13:37.514
he was not good. And on the other hand, he was as good 
as he could be off the cuff. so what I would always

13:44.189 --> 14:10.787
hope for is that he would take time on the plane or 
the car to read through it get it in his mind and then

13:44.189 --> 14:10.787
do it his way and so I didn't like doing speeches for 
him because very often he would read them and he was

13:44.189 --> 14:10.787
very poor at that that's just as a young faculty 
member at that time I and my colleagues thought

13:44.189 --> 14:10.787
that he was not a good speech maker but that he was 
good in what we called conversational speaking.

14:16.195 --> 14:17.056
That's right. And we would sometimes shake our 
heads and and snicker. Then, on the other hand, I

14:24.046 --> 14:36.525
recall he is quite often indicating that he was 
aware that speech making was not his best talent.

14:36.545 --> 14:40.150
So you're you would hope that you would provide him 
enough information in a speech outline that he

14:41.142 --> 14:44.889
could put it into his own words. Did he have any pet 
peeves or kind of things you realize about never,

14:46.452 --> 14:54.288
never in a speech?

15:01.141 --> 15:02.965
No, not really.

15:06.438 --> 15:13.971
He pretty well trusted me that I was not going to put 
together some things that just were nonsensical.

15:14.111 --> 15:20.702
He was not big on, if he told jokes it would be 
extemporaneous and he could do that well. But I

15:21.263 --> 15:23.667
would never write jokes into a speech. He was 
pretty serious minded. about how a speech should

15:27.802 --> 15:30.587
be constructed. And that's kind of old school, 
which he was, really. Prim and proper and the right

15:35.996 --> 15:40.184
things, thanks to the right people. He was good at 
complimenting people for work that they

15:41.205 --> 15:49.540
contributed to a certain project. When Nelda came 
along, Nelda, now Green, but then Rowell, she was

15:50.448 --> 16:17.383
kind of a staff assistant that worked in 
particular,

15:50.448 --> 16:17.383
I would say,

15:50.448 --> 16:17.383
those types of activities.

16:20.772 --> 16:30.863
Let's say we were going to have a

16:20.772 --> 16:30.863
host a party or something of that sort for a group of 
people. Nelda would usually be the one that would

16:31.884 --> 16:47.961
arrange for flowers and niceties and

16:31.884 --> 16:47.961
food service and things like that and I remember 
that both

16:50.827 --> 16:53.249
Am I correct? I can't think of exactly what year she 
came, but

16:53.269 --> 17:05.921
she worked with the President's wives 
incessantly. She and Mrs. Williams later would

17:07.202 --> 17:18.353
spend months selecting the theme for a Christmas 
card, the official Christmas card.

17:20.307 --> 17:30.469
She dealt with the women's kinds of things, that 
aspect of how a social event should go.

17:33.706 --> 17:36.369
the arts and crafts of a president's office. 
That's what I'm trying to say. Nelda always seemed

17:37.570 --> 17:41.435
to me to be splendidly capable. Do you have any idea 
who identified her? How did the president's

17:44.898 --> 17:47.902
office find her? She was a fairly young faculty 
wife at that time. Didn't she start working for

17:55.210 --> 17:58.954
Bill Graff? And or Wayne Hall, right in that little 
shop. I don't know. Yeah. Okay, so that was. So she

18:06.448 --> 18:23.872
was in his view, like when we were in the Koch 
building, his office, you know, the real nice

18:06.448 --> 18:23.872
office over here, and Bill Graff and then Dr. Hall, 
they were all right in that same little mix. And Mr.

18:25.614 --> 18:27.557
Rudder noticed attractive people. and if you had a 
smart one that was an attractive person too you had

18:29.157 --> 18:54.287
a bird nest on the ground and she was that way always 
pleasant always smiled and I think he just lifted

18:29.157 --> 18:54.287
her from from that staff and I know she worked for 
Bill Graff and I think Wayne Hall too but she was

18:29.157 --> 18:54.287
right in there and she was right under he had to go 
right by her to get in and out of the building even

18:54.689 --> 18:56.391
Now, when you went to work for Mr. Rudder, the 
president's office was in the Koch building.

18:58.715 --> 18:59.095
System building. In the system building. Then we 
moved to the Koch building. Then moved to the Koch

19:01.879 --> 19:03.041
building. And, of course, that had to do with the 
comings and goings of chancellors because the

19:04.163 --> 19:13.937
same offices were used. The Koch building was 
designed by Mr. Volker from New Braunfels, Texas.

19:21.087 --> 19:23.751
And he spent his entire life as a former student 
praying to design a building on the A&M campus, and

19:24.440 --> 19:32.555
he did, and it was the worst designed building 
that's ever been built with an old flat roof. The

19:33.237 --> 19:35.621
rooms don't connect properly. Nothing is right 
about that building. And one thing that was wrong

19:38.807 --> 19:43.596
about it was on the west side where my little office 
was, next to the drill field, caught the western

19:44.369 --> 19:49.013
sun as it went down. And I said to Mr. Rutter one 
time, back to his being real crisp about money, I

19:49.994 --> 20:06.148
said, do you think it would be possible for me to get 
some old cheap drapes to put in here to shield that

19:49.994 --> 20:06.148
sun out of here? He said, Cooper, if we do that for 
you, everybody on campus will want drapes. And he

20:11.613 --> 20:12.874
said, we can't afford it. So I had a simple metal 
Venetian blind, and you'd come in there, you'd

20:13.478 --> 20:24.551
have to take your tie off, take your coat off, and it 
was intolerable, the heating system, the holes.

20:25.572 --> 20:34.322
Then he came in there one August afternoon, about 
four o'clock, and it was about 82 degrees in there,

20:25.572 --> 20:34.322
and he said, my God, Cooper, he said, how can you 
work in this place? I said, well, that's why I

20:34.402 --> 20:36.364
wanted those ACs. Be quiet and get the damn things. 
He said, I don't want to come in here and find you

20:39.702 --> 20:43.087
dead someday. What was a, for Mr. Rudder, describe 
a typical work day in the office. What time did he

20:53.162 --> 20:54.384
get there? He'd

20:54.424 --> 21:03.057
get there early if there was something real 
exciting underway. I remember I always feared

21:05.302 --> 21:10.770
coming in after eight and find him there and me come 
in after he did. That was a lifelong fear that I had.

21:14.615 --> 21:30.718
Williams was easy because he would spend two hours 
in his office at the house and he'd have all of his

21:14.615 --> 21:30.718
dictations done and he'd just give the tapes to 
whoever was out front when he came in and Rudder

21:14.615 --> 21:30.718
usually had two feet of documents to sign when he 
came in and very often he would come in way before

21:32.251 --> 21:42.546
eight and get all of the reading and signatures out 
of the way. Part of his hang-up was that

21:43.047 --> 21:55.305
he wanted to see in particular everything that 
dealt with money. And he would not sign a document

21:57.665 --> 22:08.275
that had to do with a fiscal transaction without 
Tom Cherry or Clark Daigle's initials right

21:57.665 --> 22:08.275
there. If it wasn't there, he would not sign it. And 
so, he didn't go lightly with that stuff. And when

22:16.063 --> 22:22.509
he signed his signature to something, you can bet 
your sweet life it's the way he wanted it or he

22:16.063 --> 22:22.509
wouldn't sign it. Nothing just to get it out of the 
way. He just wouldn't do that. and so he held people

22:28.023 --> 22:56.207
highly accountable for uh for anything to do with 
policy changes money money transactions and

22:28.023 --> 22:56.207
things like that so he'd get in there early because 
he knew that around nine o'clock his day would be

22:28.023 --> 22:56.207
out of control and uh he couldn't say no to an old 
buddy that happened by that worked with the land

22:28.023 --> 22:56.207
commissioner that was from brady or you know he 
just he couldn't do that So he would do the heavy

22:56.575 --> 23:11.579
work early and I would go in usually around 9 
o'clock nearly every morning and sit with him and

22:56.575 --> 23:11.579
find out really what he wanted me to do that day or he 
would have things that he wanted to bounce off of

22:56.575 --> 23:11.579
me. I'm not saying that I was that influential at 
all. He just When he wanted to get an average guy's

23:20.639 --> 23:25.025
reaction to something, he would ask me those 
questions. And it always made me feel good when

23:26.067 --> 23:29.211
that door would open. He'd knock at a little hall 
there at the system building, a little bitty

23:29.311 --> 23:36.161
office. He'd knock and come in and sit on the desk 
and say, you know, this has really been on my mind.

23:41.249 --> 23:50.562
And it made me feel real good when he would take me 
into his confidence because he was so busy that he

23:41.249 --> 23:50.562
didn't have time to do that whole lot. There were 
days that we would be right next to each other and

23:51.503 --> 23:55.228
hardly ever see each other. Lunches, were those 
usually working lunches or did he have a schedule

23:57.311 --> 24:06.844
that included a lot of social activity at lunch? He 
loved to host lunches and very, very few of his

24:08.386 --> 24:20.683
lunches were at home.

24:22.385 --> 24:48.156
he would have a lunch somewhere with someone and 
usually nearly always talk business did i tell you

24:22.385 --> 24:48.156
the story before about his daughter and the boy 
that she was in love with he

24:22.385 --> 24:48.156
was very strict with the girls they would they were 
the president's daughters they would not wear

24:22.385 --> 24:48.156
shorts even in the privacy of that house that was 
not done and he kept Mrs. Rutter bless her heart on a

24:49.385 --> 25:16.523
very strict budget and most of the time she didn't 
have nearly all the help she needed when there was a

24:49.385 --> 25:16.523
function at the house he just expected her to do it 
he didn't want to spend money for that he'd buy the

24:49.385 --> 25:16.523
booze and the refreshments is always good but she 
had to she had to do most of it but Jane fell in love

25:18.106 --> 25:24.997
with a nice-looking, big, old, tall boy that was 
headed into veterinary medicine.

25:27.662 --> 25:45.210
And

25:27.662 --> 25:45.210
Mr. Rutter would not allow young men to come to the 
house, but she told this boy that on Thursday that

25:27.662 --> 25:45.210
nobody was going to be home but her, and she wanted 
to fix his lunch. And they had worked this out. He

25:48.984 --> 25:57.694
worked for buildings and grounds, and he worked as 
a gardener, working his way through school. And

25:59.055 --> 26:02.860
that day, he was working in the president's rose 
garden. They hauled him in on a dump truck. You've

26:06.584 --> 26:07.124
seen them.

26:10.028 --> 26:17.256
The whistle blew, which Dr. Williams stopped 
immediately when he got here, and the boy threw his

26:17.405 --> 26:41.927
hoe down there in the president's yard and told the 
old guy with a khaki shirt buttoned at the collar he

26:17.405 --> 26:41.927
said y'all go on home for lunch he says I'm going to 
eat here walked in the front door of the

26:17.405 --> 26:41.927
president's home and the old man nearly had a heart 
attack his supervisor with physical plant he said

26:17.405 --> 26:41.927
I'm going to eat here and walked into the 
president's house and the guy could just see his

26:17.405 --> 26:41.927
job flying out the window. He had no idea about the 
boy. I think it was Jane. That was the funniest

26:48.813 --> 26:55.460
thing that I can recall about getting around the 
old man. He

26:55.500 --> 27:10.075
was in four years

26:55.500 --> 27:10.075
under intense pressures.

27:12.873 --> 27:19.864
I never saw him out of control of his temperament, 
never. I could tell when he was really mad. You

27:23.449 --> 27:35.488
could look at his eyes and he would turn ashy white 
and his eyes took on a laser beam, but he never

27:23.449 --> 27:35.488
raised his voice. Jack Williams did. I've seen him 
lose his temper once at me that really made me feel

27:37.574 --> 27:42.881
bad. What would be the causes of Mr. Rutter's 
anger, frustration? Somebody doing something

27:51.795 --> 28:01.128
that they knew was wrong and did it anyway, a policy 
matter. He was very, very sensitive. about the

28:06.383 --> 28:08.025
written word. And if a battalion story came out, 
that would send him higher. And you know of his, the

28:14.114 --> 28:18.981
DeFrank episode and all of that stuff. But he was 
really sensitive about what people said,

28:19.502 --> 28:25.771
especially in print. Not as much verbally, as when 
somebody would write a story or be quoted as saying

28:28.203 --> 28:57.906
something and the kids picked up on that the 
students knew that and a lot of the misery that he

28:28.203 --> 28:57.906
went through is because they were doing it for fun 
and they took and one thing they did of course was

28:28.203 --> 28:57.906
take it out on the Bulldog Ranger and they would 
they had those little collar I mean little

28:58.949 --> 29:22.813
blankets they'd strap on him and they'd put when 
when Mr. Rutter was promoted from brigadier to

28:58.949 --> 29:22.813
major general in the reserve you go from one star to 
two and that day Ranger came out with two gold stars

28:58.949 --> 29:22.813
on his on his blanket and then when he was having the 
big row with DeFrank Ranger came by the office one

29:23.958 --> 29:30.049
day and he had on a blanket that said, I'm talking 
about a dog blanket, maroon. And the big letter

29:31.631 --> 29:37.441
that says, I read bat editorials.

29:37.461 --> 29:39.084
Now the students made the blankets. They had one, 
evidently, that they just, whatever was on their

29:41.108 --> 29:46.557
mind that day, they would do it. And I don't know who 
was behind all that, but I imagine Tommy DeFrank

29:46.891 --> 29:50.916
was part of it. But if there was a big issue, Ranger 
would come out with some kind of an ornament or sign

29:51.456 --> 30:03.331
on that would poke fun at him. One day I got a call 
from Ann Rudder in tears on the phone. It was a

30:12.441 --> 30:13.843
Sunday afternoon. And she says, Edwin, I think 
Ranger's drowned. I said, come on. Dogs don't

30:20.220 --> 30:21.202
drown. All dogs can swim. She said, well, he jumped 
out of our boat. He went down, and he hadn't come

30:25.067 --> 30:26.669
out. So wherever I was, I went out to Carter Creek. 
And that dog had jumped out of that boat and went

30:33.238 --> 30:41.569
down like a sack of concrete to the bottom and 
drowned. and she says how are we going to find him I

30:42.899 --> 31:01.397
said well let me see I found a fishing pole I said 
where do you think it was and we were out in the boat

30:42.899 --> 31:01.397
and I prodded around and finally I felt it I said 
he's right here and I don't know whether I went down

30:42.899 --> 31:01.397
or I guess I did.
