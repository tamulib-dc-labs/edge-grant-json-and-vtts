WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:04.198
Okay, yeah. That's the best part. That's been most 
of the time with Lloyd. Okay, Rick, tell me your

00:11.128 --> 00:18.518
name, full name, please, and your place and date of 
birth and the whole thing. My name is John

00:18.538 --> 00:21.782
Frederick Stetter. Rick is derived from the 
Frederick. I was born in San Francisco,

00:25.628 --> 00:28.772
California, February 28, 1947. and spent quite 
early. I grew up in Northern California. Where? A

00:40.413 --> 00:46.060
lot of it in a little town called Nevada City, which 
is a gold rush. See, I worked in Georgetown,

00:46.080 --> 00:48.422
California once. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and that was 
not too far away, was it? No, it's just across the

00:51.566 --> 00:52.547
country. That was the greatest summer that I ran in 
my life. It was

00:54.830 --> 00:59.716
a wonderful place to grow up. And? You grew up 
there, went to high school in Nevada City? Yeah,

01:04.609 --> 01:08.013
Nevada Union High School. And college? I went off 
to... Your parents, what were they doing? Oh, my

01:12.738 --> 01:21.287
father worked in the steel industry, and then they 
moved to the San Francisco area after I got out of

01:12.738 --> 01:21.287
the house. And my father basically worked for the 
Department of Defense for most of his life. Oh,

01:25.992 --> 01:26.953
Danny? Yeah. Lois was a mauler. A mauler's a super 
mauler. That's an amazing thing for a guy like him

01:30.098 --> 01:33.943
to come out of that deal and go to Reed College. 
Yeah, Medford. Yeah, Medford and then to Reed

01:35.465 --> 01:39.010
College. My mom was a housewife.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.037
She did. Yeah. So, then to school, college. I went 
on to the University of California, Berkeley in

01:48.863 --> 01:54.511
1960, fall of 65. Why Berkeley? Oh, it was all kinds 
of reasons that got me out at the time living in

01:55.658 --> 02:02.667
Northern California. What I wanted to do was get 
out of

02:02.687 --> 02:14.223
Northern California and move to the city in San 
Francisco up to North Beach and follow in the

02:02.687 --> 02:14.223
footsteps of the poor. So you hit it right at prime 
time. Yeah, it turned out for sure. Too prime time

02:18.048 --> 02:21.092
for me by the time Middle of 1967, I was on enormous 
academic probation by the spring of 67. Although

02:29.888 --> 02:36.057
it was difficult to be thrown out of Berkeley in 
that time, I was thrown out of Berkeley. Don't

02:36.077 --> 02:36.718
worry. And shortly thereafter, my draft board- 
Did they? Yeah. Decided I was 1A, and that was it. So

02:45.592 --> 02:51.180
I was drafted in 68, went to Vietnam in 69, and came 
back. in January of 1907 and then went back to

02:52.105 --> 02:59.195
school in Sacramento County. You were getting 
over a year? Yeah. What, in infantry? It was a funny

03:03.621 --> 03:05.263
thing. I was trained. I had to normally do a draft 
before school. Yeah. strange sequence of events i

03:13.182 --> 03:39.679
let him go to uh air traffic patrols which was run by 
the air force over the western mississippi uh but i

03:13.182 --> 03:39.679
got over there and they shipped me into an infantry 
unit up on the cambodia border and i showed up and

03:13.182 --> 03:39.679
locked up and said i have a new atc guy and first 
sergeant laughed said he didn't need no atc guys

03:13.182 --> 03:39.679
and i would say He was going to be on a helicopter 
trip

03:40.317 --> 03:53.128
so for the first four months I was an observer on a 
little scout helicopter that flew around and got

03:40.317 --> 03:53.128
shot at. It was a real bad job to have. I don't think 
so. And finally, somebody rotated out of the

03:55.724 --> 04:04.193
building a tower. They had a patchy tower. So I got 
to put that into the tower. So I finished it. So you

04:06.176 --> 04:09.239
worked there for about a year or anything during 
that time? No, a little less. I was there for two

04:11.722 --> 04:18.289
years, and I got shipped over there a year and a 
month into it, so I was there about two years. my

04:20.935 --> 04:46.065
neighbor across the street decorated vietnam 
whatever really wounded and all that kind of stuff

04:20.935 --> 04:46.065
packed my neighbor over on westover street coming 
along we had two different tours he was a engineer

04:20.935 --> 04:46.065
officer built roads or built whatever they built 
over there yeah they built everything

04:48.728 --> 04:52.255
So you came back and finished. Yeah, I did finish at 
Berkeley with Cal State Sacramento. In what?

04:58.968 --> 05:02.535
English.

05:03.629 --> 05:14.062
I got a bachelor's degree and I was sort of sitting 
in the graduate department there, not because I

05:03.629 --> 05:14.062
had any good vocation, but because I didn't know 
what else to do. And my best friend in the world, who

05:14.082 --> 05:27.778
I'd been with at Vietnam, called me up from Five 
Stamps, Arizona and said, hey, I'm working for a

05:14.082 --> 05:27.778
publisher down here. Did I want a job? I said, hell 
yes. I moved down to Flagstaff and worked for the

05:29.547 --> 05:35.155
Northland Press. The Northland Press? Yeah, 
which still

05:37.318 --> 05:44.809
is a publisher of books on Native American 
architecture and stuff. Commercial work. So that

05:45.169 --> 05:49.615
was, what year was that?

05:52.560 --> 05:52.760
It was 72. And so you moved to Flagstaff? Yeah. I 
like that. best place i like sedona we all we are

05:56.549 --> 06:21.696
still trying to retire me too because you know i did 
a history of the forest service in the southwest i

05:56.549 --> 06:21.696
remember when you did that yeah in the 80s early 80s 
or something like that and we went through there

05:56.549 --> 06:21.696
and we both loved it oh it's the best and i probably 
had a nickel then to spend you know and the prices

05:56.549 --> 06:21.696
were probably Okay. Oh, you could, yeah, you could 
buy some stuff. And we actually looked in the

06:28.674 --> 06:30.056
house. We walked in the house within 30 minutes 
there, I guess, about

06:30.216 --> 06:41.449
two or three years ago. Okay, so you have a job in 
Flagstaff. How long were you with them? What are

06:46.034 --> 06:46.855
you doing? Well, that was interesting. I started 
out... just its back door in the production

06:49.452 --> 06:52.177
department. I was literally polishing the press 
and loading the paper and doing stuff like that

06:52.197 --> 06:58.049
just to be in publishing. And, uh, Worsland at that 
time, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Justin

06:58.069 --> 07:07.447
Industries, uh, out of Fort Worth, which is Justin 
Foods and Justin Cohen. Oh, it's a huge

07:07.467 --> 07:09.872
multinational. Uh, but, John Justin had loved 
Western art, and he buddied up with the guy who

07:10.495 --> 07:19.168
founded Northern Press, who was a crazy alcoholic 
called Weaver. He was a great bookman. In fact,

07:22.674 --> 07:26.720
Weaver really found me at the brain. And I went from 
being the load-runner on the production of the

07:26.980 --> 07:36.375
production department to the editor-in-chief 
over about two years. Mostly because so many

07:36.395 --> 07:38.578
people above me It was a terrible

07:38.997 --> 07:44.007
place to live. And so I was, after about two and a 
half years, the Museum of Northern Arizona, which

07:44.027 --> 07:57.612
is just up the road from Boston, decided to expand 
their publication program. So I went up there as

07:57.632 --> 07:59.837
the publisher for the museum. Did you really? That 
should have been mine. Oh, it was wonderful. And I

08:01.981 --> 08:13.575
got to spend, we did a quarterly color magazine 
called Plateau, which was on the Native American

08:01.981 --> 08:13.575
cultures and natural history of Colorado 
Plateau. So your job with them was editor,

08:13.595 --> 08:18.842
director of their press, or what did you call it? I 
was the, well, we called it the head of

08:18.862 --> 08:22.486
publications. Okay. some regional

08:24.357 --> 08:39.662
trade books, we did technical archaeology and 
geology, and we did the journal. It was a great job.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.027
I got to draft the Colorado and dig up dinosaurs, 
and Chen Li, because we had this big research thing

08:40.203 --> 08:43.027
going. That was really what was paying for the 
build. And that was

08:44.320 --> 08:55.072
wonderful. And I did that for three years now. So, 
let me kind of do that. So, 72, 3, 4, 5, 75, say to 70.

09:03.722 --> 09:05.684
70, 79, yeah. 279,

09:05.704 --> 09:09.368
yeah. 75, I think it's 79, yeah. In the museum, the 
economy that grows called Contract Archaeology.

09:17.423 --> 09:20.869
What happened was they brought in some real 
business types to our museum. They jacked up the

09:20.889 --> 09:24.756
overhead. And a lot of the guys that learned how to 
do salvage archaeology and paleo, the museum left

09:24.776 --> 09:30.325
and set up their own little companies. And so we 
were charged 60% overhead, they were charged two.

09:34.781 --> 09:41.010
So that all, the whole museum over a period of a 
couple years got flipped over, and the whole

09:34.781 --> 09:41.010
research side. There was wonderful people there 
for about 24 years. And they all went off to do other

09:44.615 --> 09:46.217
things. In fact, there's an alumni association 
now that I just couldn't get aware of. Is that

09:49.421 --> 09:50.162
right? Yeah. So my boss, who had been the dean of 
liberal arts at the University of Arizona, Herman

09:51.163 --> 09:58.573
Whitefield, He called me up one day, and I came to 
his office, and he said, look, you're going

09:59.228 --> 10:25.063
to have to lay off, I think I had four people on the 
staff, you're going to have to lay off two of them,

09:59.228 --> 10:25.063
and if I were you, I'd be out of here by the end of 
December, because I'm going back to Tucson, and

09:59.228 --> 10:25.063
it's going to get tough. So, I went to work for a big 
aerospace outfit out of Silicon Valley, Kaiser

10:25.083 --> 10:26.805
Aerospace. doing technical publications, which 
is where I met my wife, Christine. And I did that

10:32.318 --> 10:35.381
for... That's Kaiser Aerospace. Yeah. They sure 
took a look at me when the Cold War stopped. Is that

10:40.187 --> 10:40.707
right? Oh, Jesus, yeah. But it was big, because I 
was here in the early 60s. So you were a technical

10:45.353 --> 10:48.637
editor or something for them? Yeah. We didn't do 
the main spectrum, but we provided the system. Her

10:50.950 --> 10:54.835
first name is C-H? Uh, C-H. All right. That's 
P-I-N-N. Yeah. I think I remember her spelling it.

11:03.327 --> 11:04.108
They like to spell it. I don't know. I'll probably 
get canned. She would be the one. It's fair. She was

11:07.173 --> 11:10.337
not a good interviewer. She was one of the worst. 
She's... She's a traitor. And I thought I knew. I

11:16.766 --> 11:19.069
don't think anybody does that. That's crazy.

11:23.182 --> 11:28.266
Okay,

11:23.182 --> 11:28.266
so you met, you married. Actually, what we met, and 
then I, after about a year, I took a job as the editor

11:29.107 --> 11:47.603
of the Great Basin National History Series at the 
University of Nevada Press.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.005
Okay, hold on, let me get that. You got an editor at 
the Great Basin. And that was a funded series. We

11:51.386 --> 11:52.767
had a bunch of books, a series of books. It was 
great. And now that was where? University of

11:57.497 --> 12:06.653
Nevada Press, which is

11:57.497 --> 12:06.653
located there. And the director there was the 
first director, the only director, was Robert

12:06.673 --> 12:12.443
Waxholtz, who was Paul Waxholtz's brother. He was 
the center. Old Nevada basketball. And Bob was a

12:16.270 --> 12:22.619
crappy

12:16.270 --> 12:22.619
press writer. He was a great writer. That was 
really what

12:23.361 --> 12:29.029
he did. He was a

12:29.049 --> 12:37.241
great press writer. Lacksall. Is it L-A? 
L-A-X-C-L-T. Okay. Is it Robert or Bob? Robert.

12:39.465 --> 12:39.985
Very distinguished writer. And Bob retired 
suddenly right then and there before Bob.

12:48.333 --> 13:09.838
I was by way

12:48.333 --> 13:09.838
far a junior guy on the staff, but because the other 
people on the staff had managed to piss all kinds of

12:48.333 --> 13:09.838
other folks off over the years, I was the only 
acceptable candidate for acting director. I

13:10.519 --> 13:15.985
couldn't believe they called me up, the 
chancellor called me up and said, you want to be the

13:10.519 --> 13:15.985
acting director? I said, shit, are you kidding? 
So, and it took them about a year, no, yeah, about a

13:17.189 --> 13:20.613
year to hire me. They left me do that for a year and 
gave me a chance to show them the stuff so that I got,

13:20.633 --> 13:31.124
I was hired to work there and stay there. So that 
started about 1980? Three or four. Let's see, I

13:34.287 --> 13:37.631
got, I was named director in 1984. But you were 
acting a year before that? Yeah. Oh yeah, sure, I

13:41.255 --> 13:44.038
was, it was a little press, but it was. Yeah. I do 
like Reno. I love it. Reno itself, there's nothing

13:49.149 --> 13:54.175
to recommend the town, but if you go west, you're 
right into the Sierras. If you go east or north,

13:55.156 --> 13:59.862
you're into the Great Basin Desert, which is 
gorgeous. There's a lake, everybody thinks about

13:59.902 --> 14:04.748
Lake Tahoe. You go down north to Reno, it's a 
pyramid lake, named by John Freeman, which is

14:04.768 --> 14:10.675
bigger than Lake Tahoe, but it's a desert lake. 
It's a lot of fun. And my wife's family, my family, I

14:12.033 --> 14:16.679
work at San Francisco. And it's just a three-hour 
trip. Yeah, the last time we'd been there was,

14:17.600 --> 14:22.086
again, 20 years ago or so. It was kind of 
interesting. You know, we'd been to what we'd

14:23.127 --> 14:26.532
gambled. We only won $370 on a nickel machine. 
Damn! That was big stuff. That was going. Coming

14:33.982 --> 14:35.584
back, we left it. Oh, yeah, yeah. But it was 
interesting. But I never quite figured Reno out.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.404
It's probably changed. It was small, but the 
downtown is still the downtown. Because when we

14:48.588 --> 14:53.714
were there years ago, the only thing there was that 
big Hilton Hotel and the car museum. But this

14:54.254 --> 14:55.656
gambling was big. And man, there's a Silver 
Legacy, Circus Circus, and they're all making

14:55.676 --> 15:02.984
good. It's not Las Vegas now. We like Las Vegas. But 
it kind of grows over the years. The thing is, my

15:11.782 --> 15:31.549
best friend in the world still, who was on my

15:11.782 --> 15:31.549
editorial board, and who every now and then was an 
author, and he's not an editor anymore. He has been

15:33.572 --> 15:34.473
an editor for about a decade now. I love it. I just 
can't get enough of it. We're going on a trip. Oh,

15:39.074 --> 15:39.675
it's a trip. There's some good stuff down there, 
too. We're going to do a chant of Death Valley.

15:47.611 --> 15:49.656
We're going to use it right at the dam. We're going 
to go down to the San Luis Dam in the area now. And

15:52.081 --> 15:52.562
then up to Virginia. Not to Virginia. To... I don't 
know. Did you know

15:54.127 --> 16:03.182
Nick Davies? Did I ever ask you that? You know what, 
Davies, when I told him I was coming down to

16:08.170 --> 16:12.557
interview for his job, he said, You tell my good 
friend Henry Detlock that when I... Maybe you told

16:12.537 --> 16:16.162
me that. When I came walking into Shannari's to 
meet you guys, and I clicked those boxes over, I had

16:16.222 --> 16:21.570
two. I was armed with two pieces of information. 
One of them was that you were a friend of Dick Davis.

16:25.856 --> 16:25.957
Okay. And the other one had something to do with 
Dave Schmidt. And that was my entourage. Okay.

16:33.768 --> 16:37.593
Because I got a letter from Dick the other day. But I 
didn't call him while I was up there, and I should

16:37.634 --> 16:40.738
have. For a while, he was the highest paid 
professor because he went from being... Yeah, he

16:41.039 --> 16:51.173
was a chancellor or whatever of that division. He 
was like, oh yeah, he was a big guy. Yeah. And he

16:53.496 --> 16:57.621
stepped down under pressure. And the history 
department, who he basically, they understood

16:57.641 --> 17:07.474
that he, in their view, had betrayed. They were so 
pissed at him that they wouldn't let him get an

17:10.469 --> 17:16.194
office, or the rest of them had their office, so he 
was in a little basement over at the health

17:10.469 --> 17:16.194
services. The thing was, he was making about 
$140,000 a year sitting in that little basement,

17:16.354 --> 17:21.779
so he didn't care. He told me when he came by with 
Amy, he said, shit, I'm laughing all the way to the

17:21.799 --> 17:29.066
next room. Well, I can sympathize with that. Yeah. 
Well, but anyway, he had published this thing in

17:29.887 --> 17:35.272
Harcourt's series, Home of Sports. Yeah. And I got 
a publication out, this is Yeah, it was nice. I

17:40.264 --> 17:41.565
don't know how it worked. Oh, you haven't been 
sitting on your- No, I haven't been sitting on it.

17:52.236 --> 18:08.573
Right now, I'm trying to get a contract to do a 
history of the Savannah River Nuclear Reactor

17:52.236 --> 18:08.573
Program.

18:11.202 --> 18:15.166
And we just finished a history of the… I'll tell you 
about it. In December, this past December, one of

18:15.186 --> 18:23.515
the authors of the Galileo Incorporated, we did a 
history of planetary astronomy for NASA. Yeah,

18:23.535 --> 18:24.196
great. I wasn't the key author, but my contract, 
so… Do you remember that one you did for the Alabama

18:24.496 --> 18:40.973
Missile…

18:24.496 --> 18:40.973
NASA? Oh, you mean my application? Yeah, whatever 
it is. Nothing. Didn't get that. And I don't

18:48.220 --> 19:01.014
remember what all the, that was, um, I don't know, I 
don't remember. I don't remember.

19:04.397 --> 19:04.738
I don't remember. I don't remember. Sometimes. 
Anyway. And David, I guess, is doing all right. Oh,

19:15.210 --> 19:16.511
yeah. Okay, that's the acting director, and then 
your director, Nate Fortill.

19:24.059 --> 19:33.669
What came

19:24.059 --> 19:33.669
to your

19:24.059 --> 19:33.669
mind? I should know. I'm not very good. Oh, no. 
While you were at Reno, the tilt at the University

19:37.113 --> 19:51.911
of Reno, have you had a lot of natural

19:37.113 --> 19:51.911
history time? The press was, we weren't exactly 
one church county, but we were close. We had about

20:00.601 --> 20:03.345
four areas. We had which was a huge thing because, 
number one, we were the only people doing it. In

20:06.678 --> 20:18.192
fact, Bob Wagstaff used

20:06.678 --> 20:18.192
to have Lloyd Wyman come in every once in a year for a 
three-day review of the press. And they took none

20:18.212 --> 20:20.235
of the advice away. Lloyd told me, he said, I'm not 
coming back here anymore. We had vast studies. Bob

20:22.698 --> 20:24.841
Wagstaff was vast. But more importantly, William 
Douglass, who was at University of Chicago and

20:24.861 --> 20:31.369
asked anthropologists had developed a very 
respected, well-published editor series of the

20:32.125 --> 20:41.279
Baskets. I didn't know it at the time, because he 
and I used to... Bob Waxhaw would work the toilet

20:41.500 --> 20:48.611
paper with that check, and I would work Douglas 
first. And I wasn't that way with him. I was

20:50.234 --> 20:52.657
deferential to him, but not in any way. So Bill and I 
used to match heads. The Baskets, the Bask studies

20:54.480 --> 20:57.405
were very important. And now, those studies were, 
and what... Oh, we did everything from

20:59.750 --> 21:04.397
dictionaries to the postural studies. Okay, so 
that was really the source of funding rather than

21:06.199 --> 21:13.630
the description of it, rather than the definition 
of the program. It was a very good component of the

21:13.650 --> 21:19.418
program. It was probably where we made the most 
money. We also published regional history. So

21:23.510 --> 21:26.714
that was a funded series much like we're running 
here. No, as a matter of fact, it wasn't a funded

21:27.095 --> 21:31.161
series, but because we had the only one. I mean, we 
were literally the only press in the country at

21:31.882 --> 21:40.534
that time, and probably close to it now, who had 
really seriously published a vast scholarship.

21:40.554 --> 21:45.100
And so we sold everything we read. Where were they 
sold? Oh, libraries. We did some popular books. We

21:48.845 --> 21:49.746
did a Basque book. We did... stuff with the Basque 
population in Idaho, Nevada,

21:51.353 --> 22:02.809
and Utah, and Northern California. Oh, yeah, we do 
the classic monographs where you do 700 copies and

22:02.829 --> 22:09.919
sell them to our libraries and scholars. Bob 
Laxalt, we republished one of his novels,

22:09.939 --> 22:15.587
probably some 10,000 copies now. So a lot of Basque 
studies, regional natural history, regional

22:15.727 --> 22:19.673
history. That's right. I remember that, which is 
what attracted you to A&M. Yeah, it was good stuff.

22:31.662 --> 22:34.924
Like, I look back and I'm sure. Okay, so in fall of 
88, you come to Texas A&M. And what are your several

22:40.810 --> 22:48.216
things, your personal impressions when you walk 
in the situation? For example, I always say, you

22:48.236 --> 22:49.457
know, He was impressed and astounded by how

22:49.707 --> 22:58.317
normal people were. And then your impressions of 
the status of the A&M grads. How you viewed

23:02.521 --> 23:14.475
them?

23:14.655 --> 23:18.499
I was extraordinarily impressed with the campus, 
the size, It's

23:18.935 --> 23:38.400
sort of a sense

23:18.935 --> 23:38.400
of

23:18.935 --> 23:38.400
just presence. The press building was amazing. 
I'd never seen anything like that. When you walk in

23:39.762 --> 23:41.264
and the logo comes, the logo is Boston on the floor. 
I was just totally blown away. It was just... very

23:42.593 --> 24:12.027
well, it was very

23:42.593 --> 24:12.027
formal, and it was,

23:42.593 --> 24:12.027
and I had the sense, partly from Lloyd, because

23:42.593 --> 24:12.027
he gave me some good advice that I didn't 
necessarily follow to my own degree, that

23:42.593 --> 24:12.027
essentially the press was a creature of one name, 
and that if you worked there you were sort of in the

23:42.593 --> 24:12.027
service that there was

24:14.690 --> 24:33.393
no dominant

24:14.690 --> 24:33.393
personality there. Like some

24:33.413 --> 24:37.958
presidents, the director would be the big guy. At 
A&M, and Gayla was the one who, of course, I

24:37.978 --> 24:42.443
remember a gentleman, Betty Moore, I wanted to 
make Gayla the assistant director, and I've been

24:37.978 --> 24:42.443
there for a while, and she was clearly the one, and 
she had all things in mind. She was going to be sure

24:42.463 --> 24:43.785
that nobody else had any interest in her. So, but I 
was really impressed with everything. Now, when

24:52.646 --> 24:57.193
you say the impression was a creature of one man, 
were you talking about Wardlaw? Yeah. Yeah, okay.

24:58.876 --> 24:59.437
But that's good. That fits with what I'm trying to 
do and to dispel at the same time. Yeah. And I think

25:03.764 --> 25:05.166
that's what... which is why he was worried about 
this chapter. Oh Christ, I'd be scared of death.

25:15.232 --> 25:16.495
Well, obviously. Yeah, the sense

25:16.515 --> 25:24.572
of that was...

25:26.695 --> 25:34.788
Boyd and I went out and got really drunk a bunch of 
times before we left. Because he stayed there for a

25:34.808 --> 25:36.250
while. That was extraordinary too. I moved into 
the director's office and he was there for a while.

25:43.562 --> 25:45.345
Yeah. Well see now that's what happened to me and 
Boyd. Now he and, uh, Wardlaw. Wardlaw, yeah. I

25:50.373 --> 25:51.174
just, I never said anything like that. Yeah. And, 
uh, he said, basically, it is what it is. And, uh,

25:52.767 --> 26:08.169
You're not going to win any awards you get going 
with the staff, or a part of the staff. He was

26:08.189 --> 26:11.895
absolutely right. Fight out what the strengths 
are, how you can play into this. I found some areas

26:14.599 --> 26:16.281
that I did very well. Don't get brugged into 
things. that you're

26:17.472 --> 26:24.602
ultimately not going to have any control over your 
life. And I used to sit around there after I'd been

26:24.622 --> 26:37.280
there a couple of years, and I would think after a 
really bad day, I'm still glad I'm here. That was

26:37.400 --> 26:41.206
sort of the, I'm glad I moved. It was a hard thing. My 
wife moving her away from her family and all this

26:42.488 --> 26:46.213
stuff. So I was impressed. I was impressed with the 
editorial committee. I was impressed with the

26:55.217 --> 26:56.919
committee that hired me. Just all the stuff going 
on. And there were people in the press who I had

26:59.142 --> 27:08.175
heard of for years. I don't know if you know them. I 
don't know if you know them. It was interesting

27:11.911 --> 27:24.485
because Billingsley ignored all that crap, and he 
raised hell with everybody. He gave a hatin'

27:24.505 --> 27:36.298
advance, very hated advance, but Noel for sure 
hated advance because Noel had been left as kind of

27:24.505 --> 27:36.298
the alpha male designate, and Lloyd, if I got this 
right, had sort of brought him I

27:37.578 --> 27:54.575
know

27:37.578 --> 27:54.575
there's

27:37.578 --> 27:54.575
a lot of turbulence. Let me tell you one classic 
story. I've been there six months and I wanted to do

27:57.218 --> 28:01.663
bypass. Into them, that's right. Was it six months 
after you got here? Let's see, I got here in

28:05.862 --> 28:07.904
September. Shit, it wasn't September. The

28:11.127 --> 28:18.514
operation was in the first week of March of 1989. So 
I had to get confirmed. Wow. That's tough. Yeah, it

28:22.078 --> 28:22.978
was a surprise. And you've already met Patrick a 
couple of times. That takes time. This is the

28:25.381 --> 28:26.121
story. This is a Joe and Betty Moore story. This 
wraps around. I'm home, and recuperate. And the

28:36.077 --> 28:41.102
big book was Tom Lee. And they'd gotten, I think, 
$95,000 from the King Ranch folks to fund that

28:41.282 --> 28:49.051
book. And at some point, one of them, Lloyd, 
determined that it was going to cost more than that

28:49.071 --> 28:54.697
to do the big book. And so he went back to the King 
Ranch folks, and the King Ranch folks said, sorry

28:59.843 --> 29:28.753
grants as good as we're gonna do so

28:59.843 --> 29:28.753
he decided

28:59.843 --> 29:28.753
to put it so I get this phone call one day I'm home and 
I get a phone call And they had sent out these

29:29.290 --> 29:45.876
invitations to this selective party that he had 
near town, that included Tom Lee and his wife, and

29:29.290 --> 29:45.876
Joe and Betty Kluen from Hawaii, and all this 
stuff. They went in and said, please join us in

29:45.896 --> 29:50.022
celebrating the new publication of Joe and Betty 
Morris, blah, blah, blah. One of the people who got

29:50.042 --> 29:55.371
that was the administrator for the Penn Ranch 
Ranking Commission. He was a lawyer in San

29:55.431 --> 29:56.833
Antonio. And he called up and said, well, this is 
really interesting, but I can tell you that if you

29:58.703 --> 30:15.019
put John Betty Moore's name on this, that we will 
want all the money back, plus the interest that's

29:58.703 --> 30:15.019
included in the last four years. And the next call 
I'm going to make is going to be the Chancellor of

30:15.039 --> 30:20.605
the University, so please have Mr. Steader, in 
whatever state he might be in, give me a ring. So I

30:20.625 --> 30:21.626
called the guy up. I had dinner, I had lunch with him 
one day in San Antonio, so I was unspeakable. We had

30:27.509 --> 30:34.576
a very fuzzy little

30:27.509 --> 30:34.576
conversation. We said, hey, look, I'm not trying 
to be a jerk, but I can tell you that the King Ranch

30:34.776 --> 30:51.293
people are not going to think this is funny in the 
police after they gave you all this stuff. And

30:51.313 --> 30:52.795
there's no cure for this that doesn't involve 
taking their name. It's just simple as that. By

30:53.616 --> 30:54.357
this time, they don't give a fuck. But it happened 
in Brown. It happened in Brown. I

30:56.163 --> 31:15.881
called Gaylor on it and said, thanks, and we're 
going to have to reprint that first signature,

30:56.163 --> 31:15.881
which fortunately was the only place where the 
series designation was given. But I'd never

31:15.901 --> 31:17.985
mentioned it to anybody before, and I knew Gaylor 
pretty well, so they wanted to know why. So they

31:18.910 --> 31:29.013
were called in, and as classy folks as they were, 
they said, listen, whatever you need to do, you're

31:18.910 --> 31:29.013
the president. And they even still flew in. And 
it's planned. So we reprinted the first city. We

31:34.485 --> 31:35.367
actually went and reprinted it.
