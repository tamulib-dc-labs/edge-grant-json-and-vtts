WEBVTT

00:01.145 --> 00:07.192
was commenting about Mr. Rutter's tenure as 
president of the university. My point is not to

00:07.212 --> 00:13.899
make too strong a point of the fact that he wasn't 
the ideal president. There can be no ideal

00:13.919 --> 00:22.228
president for anybody, I suspect, although my 
feeling now is that President Williams is doing an

00:13.919 --> 00:22.228
unusually good job. But from the standpoint of the 
faculty, I assume that he's also been a good job

00:29.090 --> 00:31.214
from the standpoint of many of the students. He's 
not as visible in many ways as Mr. Rutter was. Mr.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.302
Rutter was completely accessible. You could go 
see him almost a moment's notice, and many of us did

00:37.504 --> 00:43.394
in those days.

00:46.699 --> 00:55.654
The main point I guess I'm making in regard to Mr. 
Rutter is that he was a strong leader. and he did

00:56.123 --> 00:58.225
things with conviction. It's just that not 
everybody agreed with his convictions. This is

01:01.728 --> 01:25.928
not surprising, and my point is not to disparage 
him gratuitously at all, or to disparage him in any

01:01.728 --> 01:25.928
sense, but to indicate that it's well known in the 
history of A&M that the faculty was at times,

01:01.728 --> 01:25.928
especially certain elements of the faculty, 
certain groups, I guess maybe the Young Turks, or

01:01.728 --> 01:25.928
whatever you want to, how you want to put it, were at 
odds with Mr. Rudder. We were not always in great

01:28.270 --> 01:31.334
harmony with him. And since this is a matter of 
history, it would be foolish for me to say

01:32.515 --> 01:55.122
otherwise and not to make a point of the fact that 
one of the activities that was going on, one of the

01:32.515 --> 01:55.122
important activities that was going on in the days 
from 1962 that I'm aware of up into even the late 60s

01:32.515 --> 01:55.122
or perhaps middle and late 60s, or whatever, I 
don't know when it began to tail off, were

01:55.810 --> 02:23.252
activities in which we were appealing to Mr. 
Rutter to make certain changes in matters

01:55.810 --> 02:23.252
involving faculty participation in university 
governance and having students participate more

01:55.810 --> 02:23.252
directly in matters involving various policy. 
and so forth. And the matter of tenure, for

02:27.089 --> 02:37.481
example, came up, and it was a great, almost as if it 
were a surprise to some people in the

02:27.089 --> 02:37.481
administration that tenure even existed. Now, 
people have different opinions about tenure, I

02:37.501 --> 02:50.515
realize that, but tenure was, in fact, an issue for 
a lot of people, and it became a rather critical

02:37.501 --> 02:50.515
issue for some people in the 1960s. And there were 
lots of not lost, but a few cases where these tenure

02:55.126 --> 03:03.296
situations became crucial. And as you know, 
possibly now, Union is still on what's called the

03:03.316 --> 03:12.147
AUP censured list. And I don't know how it will ever 
get off of it. I don't know what the situation is

03:18.955 --> 03:21.698
now. But that happened back in the 60s when there 
were some problems with a particular faculty

03:25.349 --> 03:31.896
member who appealed for help and got help. And the 
A&M administration was found deficient in its

03:32.837 --> 03:37.762
handling of his case. As a matter of fact, it was a 
very careful investigation, and that's the way it

03:38.663 --> 03:42.487
stands to this day. Now, there's a new 
administration, to be sure, and in fact, a new

03:43.328 --> 03:47.092
spirit. And I doubt that that sort of thing will 
ever happen again. But the fact is, even though

03:53.986 --> 03:59.354
that sort of did happen, and then it was changed in 
that regard remarkably. I think it would be rather

03:59.955 --> 04:05.364
remiss of me not to mention that this sort of thing 
did happen. And not again, I should hasten to say,

04:05.384 --> 04:12.615
to disparage Mr. Rudder or to tarnish any memory of 
him. He was a likable man. I enjoyed him

04:17.282 --> 04:18.464
personally. Not always, but frequently I did. He 
had a certain ingenuity, a certain frank spirit

04:23.467 --> 04:29.195
about him. He would talk to you man to man. And he 
was, no question about it, a leader of people. But I

04:37.866 --> 04:42.232
didn't always agree with the way he led the people. 
I thought that would be worth clarifying. We got

04:44.976 --> 04:46.858
into it in the last part of the tape. Now, you 
probably have some more direct questions you'd

04:47.260 --> 04:50.667
like to ask me, Scott. Right. When you came back 
from the University of Missouri, back down to A&M,

04:51.930 --> 05:02.333
and you've mentioned the changes in the 
university, what were the main changes in that?

05:02.768 --> 05:12.706
community in the Bryan College Station area, and 
also not only in the physical sense, but also in the

05:02.768 --> 05:12.706
population sense? And what were some of the 
factors that affected that you could see? Well,

05:17.274 --> 05:27.612
first of all, of course, one of the remarkable 
things that seemed to happen, even in the time that

05:17.274 --> 05:27.612
we were gone, for those years to the Midwest and 
came back in 62. There was a change in the, there was

05:33.102 --> 05:43.095
a very noticeable change in the total population 
of College Station in Bryan. New things were

05:44.257 --> 05:45.418
built. There was a skyscraper in Bryan, I think, 
eight, ten stories high, the Virisco building,

05:49.934 --> 05:59.684
which as I remember wasn't there, I'm not sure when 
it was built, but that's a big building, you know.

05:59.704 --> 06:03.267
Not really a big building by some standards, but a 
new big building was built. Well, the number of

06:03.748 --> 06:14.358
people was increasing remarkably and has 
increased remarkably since 1962, as everyone

06:03.748 --> 06:14.358
knows. The two communities merged completely 
They may have been merged in the old days, but they

06:18.959 --> 06:25.128
weren't really physically that way. They may have 
had city limits that were in common, but now

06:25.468 --> 06:31.176
they're literally contiguous cities. You can't 
tell unless you saw the city limits sign where one

06:31.216 --> 06:38.166
starts and the other ends. That's a remarkable 
change. Both cities have changed in that regard.

06:43.438 --> 06:48.244
Industry-wise, I don't know a lot about that, but 
there isn't an awful lot of industry in either

06:43.438 --> 06:48.244
town. There's a little bit more in Bryan, of 
course, for fairly obvious reasons, I guess. It

06:55.072 --> 07:01.059
has sought an industry slightly more vigorously. 
And obviously, College Station's industry is

07:01.700 --> 07:08.068
A&M. can be, apparently, indefinitely. As far as 
the spirit of things around here is concerned,

07:12.436 --> 07:17.783
there's been a very progressive spirit. Let me 
mention this. This is an indicator. There was a

07:20.387 --> 07:32.483
time, not too long ago, in fact, since 1962, when 
you would drive along the North Gate area on

07:20.387 --> 07:32.483
University, what's now called University Drive, 
and I guess always has been, but I had forgotten

07:20.387 --> 07:32.483
what it was called. It had some name, FM, former 
market road 60, maybe. But the Northgate area was

07:37.765 --> 07:43.012
actually sort of a depressed area in a way, 
frankly, to me. I didn't think it looked at all

07:43.333 --> 07:44.875
progressive. The storefronts weren't well kept 
up. Things kind of came and went.

07:53.386 --> 07:57.772
It looked very much like a small central Texas 
town. Not to disparage small central Texas towns,

07:59.595 --> 08:03.320
but they don't look... If you look at the typical 
one, Let's take, oh, I don't know, Caldwell.

08:12.337 --> 08:17.483
Caldwell's a nice little town, but do you remember 
anything distinct about downtown Caldwell? It's

08:18.123 --> 08:32.899
not really, there are a few, there's a hardware 
store, some filling stations, a drug store, too,

08:18.123 --> 08:32.899
where you can get coffee and toothpaste and 
Photoshop, maybe, or that sort of thing. Well,

08:33.082 --> 08:34.605
that's kind of what the North Gate was. It wasn't 
anything very special about it, except there

08:34.645 --> 08:44.021
were, well, there used to be some cafes over there. 
I don't think, maybe there still are, but I

08:44.041 --> 08:51.593
remember distinctively one or two that I thought 
were acceptable. Little places to get breakfast

08:53.657 --> 08:59.106
in the morning if you needed to, go over early. But 
it was generally a rundown. It didn't look

09:01.011 --> 09:02.653
progressive. It looked like, what's the word? 
Depressed area, something like that. Whereas

09:10.683 --> 09:16.650
now, I think the Northgate area is really spruced 
up, relatively speaking. You could say more, but

09:18.533 --> 09:20.996
it's doing, I think, very, very well. And the 
general spirit of things, I think, is reflected in

09:21.056 --> 09:23.799
that. You see new... and thriving things on Texas 
Avenue and all around A&M. And I suppose that's

09:33.456 --> 09:40.669
just what happens when there are more people and 
there are more customers. There's more

09:41.531 --> 09:44.617
prosperity for those who cater to the customers. 
I'm not sure that all follows, but that's just the

09:45.719 --> 09:49.967
way I see it, simple way. So I would say that the 
general air here has gotten to the general spirit

09:50.825 --> 10:12.031
of things has gotten more, a good deal more 
progressive, and there seems to be more obvious

09:50.825 --> 10:12.031
pride in the appearance of things.

10:14.174 --> 10:16.697
And that pleases me. I'd rather have it that way 
than have it appear to be a depressed area. Now, the

10:23.257 --> 10:29.364
South Gate section is developing much more 
slowly. For reasons I don't understand, there's

10:30.285 --> 10:34.669
not as much going on over there. People move in and 
out with fabric stores and a couple filling

10:34.930 --> 10:39.414
stations. It used to be that North Gate wasn't a 
very different spirit from the South Gate area.

10:43.178 --> 10:45.621
I'm talking about beyond the tennis courts. 
There's a nice tennis shop over there, and that's

10:46.242 --> 10:50.170
marvelous. It just overruns, and I think that's 
one of my favorite places in the world. But that's

10:55.340 --> 10:57.704
not enough to sustain the community over there. 
There's a need for other things, I would guess. Of

11:00.590 --> 11:07.002
course, the Redmond Terrace area services the 
community, and that's pretty fancy now with the

11:00.590 --> 11:07.002
Aikenland Inn and And across the street, Holiday 
Inn and all those things. That takes the place of

11:11.629 --> 11:20.707
anything that would have developed in the 
so-called South Gate, what might have been called

11:11.629 --> 11:20.707
the South Gate area. Maybe isn't. Maybe never will 
be now because it's superseded by the Redmond

11:21.870 --> 11:29.445
Terrace area, the Culpepper, the new Culpepper 
Center. That's fine. It's OK with me. I like to see

11:32.775 --> 11:34.297
progress in that sense. And I think it helps 
everybody to be more comfortable and to enjoy this

11:35.499 --> 11:44.233
community. I like the old-fashioned way, too. But 
if the old-fashioned way means looking

11:47.638 --> 11:53.627
depressed, then I don't particularly like that. 
The growth of Bryan College Station, a lot of it can

11:54.147 --> 12:05.727
be attributed directly to A&M with this growth and 
more students coming. But do you see that the

12:05.747 --> 12:15.784
growth is playing off of the increase in A&M's 
enrollment or do you just see something else

12:05.747 --> 12:15.784
that's bringing people to Bryan College Station? 
I'm not sure I'm qualified to answer that. Maybe

12:20.829 --> 12:24.713
this will be a partial answer, though. I do feel 
that A&M's decision to allow coeducation

12:24.773 --> 12:36.705
here was a very smart move and a very timely move. I 
don't know whether you're aware of it, and I'm just

12:37.967 --> 12:43.392
only remotely aware of it, but other universities 
Many other universities in the country, and

12:43.844 --> 13:01.991
perhaps most other universities in the country, 
have declining enrollment, whereas A&M is

12:43.844 --> 13:01.991
enjoying, if that's the word for it, is at least 
experiencing

12:43.844 --> 13:01.991
rather remarkable increasing enrollment. A&M is 
a very popular place to come, as well as a good place

13:02.031 --> 13:06.938
to come, fortunately. My son will go to A&M, and I 
wouldn't choose another school in the state for

13:06.958 --> 13:10.864
him to go to. I'm glad he wants to go here. It turns 
out this is where he wants to go to school. But I'm

13:15.067 --> 13:15.848
just tickled. I'm very pleased. I mean, if he had 
chosen some other school in Texas, I would have

13:17.170 --> 13:22.177
been disappointed, frankly. And I don't know 
whether we could have afforded it either, but

13:23.479 --> 13:27.144
that's beside the point, momentarily. He likes to 
go to A&M. He likes the idea of going to A&M for good

13:29.968 --> 13:32.471
reasons. It's academically very strong. It's a 
good community of students that attract him. He

13:40.439 --> 13:49.308
likes the type of students that are here, and 
everything he knows about the school is positive,

13:40.439 --> 13:49.308
and that's just fine. That's what I feel. I would 
have recommended A&M to him if we had lived in

13:50.248 --> 14:00.679
Missouri, for example, if we could have afforded 
to send him to A&M, because I think it's a good

13:50.248 --> 14:00.679
school. Now, I think A&M is a better school now 
because, frankly, we do have co-education here. I

14:08.736 --> 14:16.624
think having girls to participate in things here, 
fortunately the girls that come here have the

14:08.736 --> 14:16.624
Aggie spirit. It seems to me they do. I mean, I think 
we've got some real great girls here, and I'm very

14:18.726 --> 14:25.412
pleased with the co-eds. I think they're... I 
don't know them all, of course. I know a few. I get to

14:29.598 --> 14:35.909
know them in Physics 350, because we have a few 
co-eds in there. And I'm pleased that they're

14:37.452 --> 14:40.257
here. And I'm pleased that they can be in the core 
and participate in as important an organization

14:40.498 --> 14:46.849
as that is. They seem not to be in any way 
disorienting or fouling up the core, as far as I can

14:51.908 --> 14:53.850
tell. They're good spirited gals, and I don't know 
a lot about that, frankly, but I see no, I may be

14:53.910 --> 15:08.226
wrong, but it seems to me that they're not causing 
any serious problems. They're not, so to speak,

15:08.247 --> 15:20.160
changing the core from the greatness it has always 
had, as far as I can tell. And I think having girls

15:21.811 --> 15:33.206
come here on just a routine basis and 
accommodating them in dormitories was a very

15:21.811 --> 15:33.206
important move for A&M. And my guess is, in answer 
to your question now more directly, that having

15:33.226 --> 15:50.248
coeducation here has changed the community

15:33.226 --> 15:50.248
in various ways, sometimes indirectly, 
sometimes directly, as anything else. I think

15:50.633 --> 16:06.094
there are people who come to A&M now who wouldn't 
come otherwise, who would want to be at a good

15:50.633 --> 16:06.094
school like this, but who would rather see a more 
balanced social life, more balanced than would be

15:50.633 --> 16:06.094
normally here if it were just all male. And that, of 
course, brings more students, and it helps bring a

16:07.205 --> 16:24.283
diversity of businesses or stores that 
accommodate young ladies with special kinds of

16:07.205 --> 16:24.283
clothing, I suppose, and things that are 
feminine, whereas otherwise we wouldn't have

16:07.205 --> 16:24.283
that. That accommodates the wives of people who 
have to live here and enjoy living here. And so it

16:31.611 --> 16:32.572
goes. There must be many chains of cause and 
effect, which are related to the admission of

16:35.707 --> 16:43.439
girls to A&M. And I'm very pleased that it's 
happened. I think it was inevitable, but I'm glad

16:45.262 --> 16:52.293
it happened when it did, because we now are growing 
and doing well. What do you think about it? I think

16:55.057 --> 16:57.421
it's pretty good. Dr. Dunn, I know you have a 
meeting you have to go to, and I appreciate your

16:58.842 --> 17:01.670
time. I appreciate you letting me interview you 
for this project. Well, thank you very much,

17:06.904 --> 17:08.308
Scott. It's a pleasure to participate and hope 
it's some help to you. I'm sure it will be, sir.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.282
Thank you. You bet.
