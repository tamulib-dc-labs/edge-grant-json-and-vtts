WEBVTT

00:10.493 --> 00:18.065
I was raised in the house with him, Mr. Felix 
McMillan. And they taught me mighty good. They

00:21.370 --> 00:22.532
teach me good. They said, I remember, says, Joe, I 
said, yes, sir. When we are dead and in heaven, they

00:26.558 --> 00:32.147
said, we want to raise you as an intelligent 
nigger. We want you to have good friends like we've

00:32.617 --> 00:35.600
got. Say you'll never be scratched by good, rich, 
sensible white folks because they can tell who you

00:35.640 --> 00:43.427
are by your raising and your compliments. To show 
that you've been raised, he said, not by the color,

00:43.907 --> 00:49.152
but by the white. I washed in iron. Some days I'd 
wash a hundred pieces. Some, every morning, I'd

00:53.756 --> 01:01.763
have five beds to mix up, five fires to mix, and the 
children to dress, and churning to do. And after

01:02.570 --> 01:05.776
that, but then I'd have some parts of the day. But I 
had all that to do every day. Raised right up in the

01:09.523 --> 01:10.485
house. You know, I remember telling them one 
story. You know, I slept like in this room, and they

01:15.273 --> 01:20.944
slept joining the rooms to me, you know. They said, 
Joe, if it gets cold, come in our room. I said,

01:24.190 --> 01:26.434
great, great, great.

01:29.620 --> 01:35.626
Well, can't you tell a story about your open 
girlhood days and about who raised you? Go ahead.

01:38.669 --> 01:39.350
Come on, Jim. No, you. Yeah, you. Oh, I always was a 
good girl. I don't know any stories on me. Well, did

01:46.617 --> 01:48.699
you work in the field or work in the house? I worked 
in the field and the house, too. Both places. But

01:52.042 --> 01:54.725
I'd like to see you in the building. Uh-huh. Why did 
you like the field the best? Well, just because I

01:56.859 --> 02:03.807
catch more good breeze and more good fresh air out 
in the field than I do in the kitchen, in the house.

02:04.829 --> 02:05.489
Now, you know that. I didn't go to the field until I 
was 19 years old. I love the field. I went to the

02:10.195 --> 02:16.162
field when I was 19 years old, and I remember the old 
boy said, well, Joe, you know, I had three Jims

02:10.195 --> 02:16.162
there. And I had one Jim, two Jim Max, and one Jim 
Turner, Kenneth. And, uh, My brother Jim Mack, he

02:24.953 --> 02:29.147
was a colorful and a white Jim, you know. He went 
with my old boys to look for the Jim Kennards, you

02:29.728 --> 02:35.166
know, and to put me to flying, you know. The girl 
said, sir, I want you to go up there in a while to be

02:35.888 --> 02:40.134
able to sleep. The flyer said, when Miss Dora call, 
you go back to the house and see to the baby stuff.

02:44.140 --> 02:48.527
Baby went to sleep, and I slept two or three hours, 
and I fly to the old boy's side back. But I didn't

02:48.647 --> 02:51.050
like the field. Didn't go to the field. I didn't go 
to the field. What kind of work did you like best in

02:53.794 --> 02:55.877
the field? Picking cotton. Picking cotton. 
Picking cotton. How much could you pick in a day?

03:01.426 --> 03:03.769
Well, 150, 60 cents. He wasn't pickin' very hard. 
Now, in them days, Miss Dora had a horse named John.

03:11.975 --> 03:15.880
And said, Joey, you can fly, old John. I said, yes, I 
know I can. What have you got to do? Go down in the

03:18.543 --> 03:21.467
field and fly, old John, and nothing to do. I said, 
oh, I want to go to the field. He looked at me and

03:23.429 --> 03:24.430
laughed. You know what I tell the story. You know 
what I love to do? To hide to be in the field. He said,

03:29.697 --> 03:31.840
well, you go out there and check the old John. Go 
down there and fly with Miss Dora's cat. And you

03:34.394 --> 03:51.675
know, I went, called old John Hiddens to the tennis 
ground, went down there and started dancing, and

03:34.394 --> 03:51.675
come down there sitting down by a big old old, big 
old neck on the street. I was sitting down there at

03:51.695 --> 03:56.841
the beach, and he said, Joe, I said, sir, did you 
climb in this door at that time? I said, yes, yes,

03:56.861 --> 03:57.301
yes. He said, check out old John Gordy, I'll see you 
in a minute. I don't know, I don't know. I don't

04:01.426 --> 04:01.967
know, I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. I 
don't know.

04:12.312 --> 04:14.576
Yeah. Okay.

04:20.825 --> 04:23.670
Well, Mr. Johnson, we're going to start off.

04:32.563 --> 04:32.764
All right. All right. I want you to tell me how you 
got your name. I got my name from President Jeff

04:36.590 --> 04:40.075
Davis. The president of the Southern 
Confederacy. He owned my grandfather and my

04:45.303 --> 04:47.565
father. He brought them from Richmond, Virginia. 
My grandfather was a blacksmith. My father was a

04:54.672 --> 04:56.474
young kid, wasn't grown. And my father had learned 
how to write a little bit in Richmond, Virginia

04:58.416 --> 05:02.379
before he brought me down here. Grandfather used 
to keep chalk in his shop to mark the odd things. And

05:08.565 --> 05:10.247
my father would take a piece and put it in his pocket 
And passing from Master Jeff's house, he's right

05:11.442 --> 05:14.184
on the sidewalk. And so one morning, Master Jeff 
come by and saw I was right on the walk. He go up

05:19.970 --> 05:23.373
against the cook, who there, Mere Liza. He's right 
on the sidewalk. Who's right out there? He said, I

05:25.295 --> 05:27.436
don't know, Master Jeff. He said, come out there, 
I'll show you how to do it. So he read it. He said,

05:31.280 --> 05:35.464
Mere Liza, if you can find where I might walk out 
there, I can't lie to you, so he's pretty dressed.

05:35.844 --> 05:38.206
He said, yes, Master Jeff. So one morning, he's out 
for some fish water. And she came out of this pen and

05:41.632 --> 05:46.379
she looked around and saw my father down with me 
right on the sidewalk. She told him, I'll tell you.

05:49.363 --> 05:55.912
I'll tell you something for the boy to come to the 
shop, come to the house, and ask him who in my life.

05:56.873 --> 05:59.497
He said, I'll tell you if I never had a life in this 
machine, never had a life in my life. So he brought

06:00.078 --> 06:00.819
me down here. He did, yes. He gave me a punch. He 
said, I got it, my name. My father named my idea. He

06:06.827 --> 06:07.388
called it Mike. That's my name. He wrote Jeff 
Davis' name. He wrote two names. They were dirty.

06:13.063 --> 06:13.743
They were a rich boy. They were a rich boy. He said, 
uh-huh, Ike, that's pretty nice of you. They sent

06:17.388 --> 06:23.095
him back to the shop, and Martha Giles started to 
listen to me, and he got two teachers. He opened a

06:24.156 --> 06:25.077
nice school. He educated all these niggas. He made 
my father a souvenir. And he made a couple of nice

06:30.925 --> 06:32.667
little gummies as bookkeepers. And all in all, 
they made different things. Farms, cotton,

06:35.591 --> 06:39.195
sawmills, gins, and all that kind of stuff. That's 
the record of my father and Colonel Montgomery.

06:43.916 --> 06:45.318
Colonel was born in those events. He was born on 
Hurricane Plantation, just a giant piece of

06:45.338 --> 06:48.803
biofield. I was born on biofield. Moshe Jeff had

06:53.309 --> 07:01.962
fire plantations over there. Hurricane, 
biofield, hurricane, power mine, and lake place.

07:08.611 --> 07:09.773
It all belonged to Moshe Jeff. And he had all those 
niggas from different places, all the plans to

07:11.339 --> 07:14.884
come back to school. Night school. He gave them all 
a form of education. When they all got free, they

07:19.311 --> 07:21.475
could take it themselves. He had so much business, 
he couldn't hire people who got business. He had

07:25.260 --> 07:26.182
kids. He needed education so he could tend to his 
business. He wanted to learn to tend to Moshe's

07:28.545 --> 07:31.290
business. He was admired. Obedient. Kept while he 
was gone, he obeyed Moshe. Once Moshe was going to

07:36.437 --> 07:39.422
land in the boogie, in the hack, The gate was 
locked. The same old man I tell you about, old man

07:42.410 --> 07:49.520
Jack Rayner, he got to the gate, he said, Marcy, 
this gate's locked. He said, well, Jack, it's

07:50.862 --> 07:51.944
locked. It's my gate. Bring it down. It's my gate. 
So the boy picked it up, and Jack didn't break down

07:54.587 --> 07:57.391
the gate. He took the fence down and drove on 
through there, and the wagon went on behind him,

07:58.032 --> 08:05.303
you understand, with the bands, cams, and land. 
And when he come back, they put the fence up. That's

08:08.908 --> 08:10.590
the original Marcy up in his nickels. And when he 
met a Negro on the road, first thing he must have

08:11.482 --> 08:17.070
done was look at the ceiling and say, it's that 
time. And everyone would give him the same thing

08:17.871 --> 08:19.133
back. Give him honor. And when he'd come home from 
New Orleans up to the bend, Steve would land. He'd

08:27.284 --> 08:29.267
unload the freight and load the cotton. And he'd 
get the bait there and sleep. And the captain would

08:33.332 --> 08:35.175
say, is Mr. Davis up? No, he ain't up. I really want 
him up. Wait till he wake up. Mr. Davis wake up. And

08:41.418 --> 08:49.849
he'd come downstairs, he'd pick up a chair and all, 
pack it up out on the land, send it down to his hack,

08:41.418 --> 08:49.849
and he'd get up and buy it about the third time 
before he'd get in his hack. He never allowed him to

08:51.031 --> 08:53.134
do anything like that. He just obeyed him. They all 
obeyed Marshal Jeff. The white people would

08:55.577 --> 09:01.565
always go out to the bank fishing and hunting on the 
banks when Marshal Jeff would be in the base fleet.

09:02.846 --> 09:03.607
They never did anything like that. They always 
obeyed him all the time, white and black. He gave

09:05.750 --> 09:07.132
them all. His best man would escort him home, 
escort him back when he got ready. And, uh, he's on a

09:12.164 --> 09:15.329
pageant that one day on Lake Place. He told Mr. 
Corleone, he said, Mr. Corleone, I'm going home

09:16.210 --> 09:20.477
tomorrow. He said, don't get to feed my niggas. And 
he gets to lay them by the crops. Let them be with

09:25.885 --> 09:27.187
them, cut the cordwood. But don't disturb them. I 
want them undisturbed. He said, anything happen

09:31.213 --> 09:33.537
to any of my niggas, you wait and see Mr. Davis. And 
don't forget I'm Mr. Davis. He said, my nigga is my

09:36.441 --> 09:38.044
summer shade. He's my weather fire. He's my 
umbrella. Don't disturb him. So they laid by a crop

09:41.797 --> 09:45.262
over there with sweeps. Mr. Colt, I want you to lay a 
crop with color fields. That wouldn't do no good.

09:48.686 --> 09:49.507
It wouldn't cut those vines. The Negro who must 
have been educated, one who actually laid by a crop

09:50.368 --> 09:57.618
with double sweeps. And he come back and helped 
Colt. And the next day he fired away, man. He wanted

10:02.565 --> 10:04.227
to play and live like he wanted to. He laid by the 
crop like he wanted, you understand. He had his

10:06.318 --> 10:12.387
crop cleaned, Master Jeff, cut them with those big 
switches and go in the middle, clean them out, you

10:06.318 --> 10:12.387
understand, which he couldn't do. He kept those 
vines, jumped those vines. The trees killed all of

10:14.089 --> 10:14.891
them. He cleaned his place out, the lake place. He 
had a hundred trees over there. He had all those

10:19.998 --> 10:22.481
mules from different plants, you understand, 
from where he cleaned that place. He had plenty of

10:22.501 --> 10:23.443
stock, you know. These are real stock. All you 
stick now on Hurricane, there's a pass over there,

10:25.305 --> 10:31.574
old Long Hill Sugar, outside the roadside, you 
know. All that stock he bought from Master Jeff,

10:32.075 --> 10:34.078
all that stock. Mules, cows, horses, everything 
else. Horses, everything else. Sheep, goats, all

10:36.947 --> 10:38.709
brought to him. Now he had those sheep sheared, 
seven times a year, and they had wool and shipped it

10:39.350 --> 10:46.116
somewhere. Say you do cotton, gather the gin and 
pack it. He had three, four steam gins,

10:50.360 --> 10:51.762
understand, see? These steam gins on Hurricane, 
one on Briarfield, one on everything else. Three

10:57.087 --> 10:57.888
gins, I know. He had three gins, three gins. And 
whatever he wanted, he got slaughtered on

11:00.410 --> 11:03.593
Hurricane for a steam milk quarter. And when you 
want a thing done, you just put it on paper and it's

11:04.552 --> 11:09.498
gone. It's done.

11:14.745 --> 11:23.957
You tell me how the story as to how Isaac T. 
Montgomery's father saved the plantation during

11:14.745 --> 11:23.957
the Civil War for him? Yeah, well, when the young 
was coming south to look after those places down

11:24.217 --> 11:32.568
there, he robbed somebody. I'm being serious. And 
Ben went to Ole Miss, Miss Irene, his wife. She

11:37.963 --> 11:39.065
said, Ole Miss, I've got to go to Richmond. I've got 
to see Mars Jeff. She said, you want to see Mars Jeff

11:40.748 --> 11:42.170
with Ben? I said, I've got to see him. She said, no, 
Miss, you can't do no good. I can't. I don't want to

11:45.715 --> 11:46.256
see you. I want to see Mars Jeff. I want a passport. 
Send me to Richmond to see Mars Jeff. So they gave

11:50.903 --> 11:52.105
him Ben the passport. And I went to Richmond. He got 
some bread in the sack. I went to Richmond to see

11:54.889 --> 11:56.752
him. I went to Richmond to see him. I went to 
Richmond to see him. I went to Richmond to see him. I

11:58.975 --> 12:00.297
went to Richmond to see him. I went to Richmond to 
see him. I went to Richmond to see him. I went to

12:02.220 --> 12:03.722
Richmond to see him. I went to Richmond to see him. 
Walk in there, howdy, Marshal Jeff. Hey, Ben's

12:08.247 --> 12:08.968
been here. Can I come in and see you, Marshal Jeff? 
He said, Ben, I'm telling you all you know. Howdy,

12:12.472 --> 12:13.213
everybody at home. He said, everybody's welcome, 
Marshal Jeff, but somebody come and see you about.

12:16.656 --> 12:17.237
He said, where is Ben? He said, Marshal Jeff, those 
Yankees are coming south, near Bixbury. They're

12:23.563 --> 12:31.512
coming down south, getting all that folks land, 
and robbing the niggers, stealing all the mules,

12:23.563 --> 12:31.512
and they're in pursuit of David's land. That's 
what I want you to do. He said, where is Ben? I want

12:36.335 --> 12:37.617
you to leave the land to me. Five. He said, then I'm 
going to go, girl. I said, don't you belong to me.

12:46.389 --> 12:47.010
The land's mine. You're mine. I said, how you know? 
I said, my God, free me, man. I said, bring you

12:53.579 --> 12:54.620
right. So he took him big up to the San Diego coast. 
And leave the land to him and free him. And made

12:59.727 --> 13:02.511
notes, some notes unpaid, you understand. And 
three or four unpaid. And so I'm back home, and the

13:03.706 --> 13:07.151
angels got out into the bin out home there. The 
angels come, you understand, and they ask the days

13:08.594 --> 13:11.879
of the land, the days of the farm. The days ain't got 
no land. The old man is here. He's gone to Ben

13:14.984 --> 13:15.745
Montgomery. Why is Ben Montgomery here? He said, 
come here, Ben. This old man, he asked, where'd you

13:19.691 --> 13:21.894
get that? Brought it from my old master.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.141
He called Mrs. He asked her to bring his old papers, 
you understand. Show it to him. He made those notes

13:30.588 --> 13:31.890
and papers, you understand. Uh-huh. That is your 
land. I don't know what kind of nigger your land.

13:37.411 --> 13:37.671
But I don't. I don't cross the river. It's my land, 
though. And when the freedom time come back,

13:41.997 --> 13:51.610
Master Jeff come on home, you understand, and he 
give him a cotton basket of money. What he done?

13:53.733 --> 13:54.534
Cotton basket, cotton basket. Oh, not quite high 
as the table. Like that old basket now. That was on

14:00.082 --> 14:02.485
Bradfield Place, on Bradfield, right in Master 
Jeff's house. Well,

14:03.173 --> 14:17.073
this band, you say that Jefferson Davis organized 
for his slaves. Yes, sir. Can you tell me a little

14:17.614 --> 14:19.417
something about that band? Tell me a little 
something about that band. You

14:21.300 --> 14:31.054
started to tell me about this band that... 
Jefferson Davis organized for his slaves. Yes, he

14:35.061 --> 14:37.924
organized that band for his Negroes. And Davis had 
been on barkeep transition. And he hired a man

14:41.028 --> 14:46.473
named Charles Morgan to teach them boys music. And 
he taught those boys music. They got to where he

14:50.418 --> 14:51.339
could play. They escorted him from Lennon up home 
in a wagon. And his band would play for him going and

14:55.503 --> 15:00.248
coming. And after he got through, he played in a 
bomber's uniform. And in that band, there's been

15:05.481 --> 15:07.223
bands. That's quite everywhere he went. How many 
pieces were in the band? Fourteen. Fourteen men in

15:13.591 --> 15:14.473
the band. Fourteen men. What kind of music did they 
play? Do you remember any of the pieces they

15:17.977 --> 15:19.800
played? Oh, Lord, yes, indeed. No, I played 
myself. I played Grand National, Fourth Watch,

15:22.664 --> 15:31.095
East Richmond, Mount Rose, Dream On, Flea the 
Buried to the Mountain, Nut Gilded, Dance

15:31.328 --> 15:41.383
Theater, Armistice Surgeon, Fire on Quickstep, 
all that kind of stuff. We play it up here in the

15:41.924 --> 15:48.033
store. Oh, a name, Samoy, if you remember any of 
them. That's Pete Dreamall. That's Pete

15:53.401 --> 15:54.242
Dreamall.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.111
Did you ever play this piece, Dixie, that was so 
popular? Dixie, oh yeah, Pete Dixie. Yeah, I ain't

16:01.450 --> 16:03.332
paid enough. And, uh... Flora Fluck. Flora Fluck. 
And...

16:15.228 --> 16:16.550
I don't know the other people. I'm a soldier, I 
think

16:17.271 --> 16:23.479
it was. And, uh...

16:27.269 --> 16:31.555
Well, did you, uh, you all didn't play any 
plantation songs? No, sir. I played street music

16:32.156 --> 16:33.818
myself. I got music. I didn't risk having pebbles. 
And Lion Healer. And George Sullivan. That's

16:39.185 --> 16:40.907
where I got music. We got a band from Lion Healer in 
Chicago. Well, did the other slaves on the

16:44.332 --> 16:49.058
plantation sing any of the plantation songs? They 
sing in the fields and sing around the place? Did

16:52.583 --> 16:53.985
you ever sing in the yard? for him when he had 
visitors, anything like that? Well, the kids

16:57.115 --> 17:01.660
would sing some little funny things, you know, 
around there, and dance and all that got, you know.

17:02.321 --> 17:07.567
They had a little play, used to play down there, 
play, uh, scripture sound, you understand? Dance

17:07.908 --> 17:08.849
to the bottle. Sit down all day, you know, and 
they'd dance, you know, of course, scripture

17:09.329 --> 17:12.033
sound. Everybody danced scripture sound, they'd 
ring play, you know. And, uh, they'd go dance, each

17:15.397 --> 17:19.922
time, dance with that bottle, he'd dance with the 
bottle, and the whole bottle would break. set up,

17:20.189 --> 17:26.358
you understand, and just play that song around 
that place and sing Scoop to Sam and dance with that

17:20.189 --> 17:26.358
brother, or that Rick. Well, do you remember any of 
the words of Scoop to Sam? No, I don't remember

17:30.144 --> 17:32.107
those words now. Which I could relate to. It's a 
long... And I heard we had a little song you sang,

17:34.050 --> 17:41.901
too, going to the lady, yes, I am, and she was 
talking to the man. Do you know that? No, that's the

17:43.283 --> 17:45.166
first word I think about, thank you. Do you 
remember any of the other lines of it? No, sir.

17:51.728 --> 17:53.511
No, sir. Well, did you all have any dancers at that 
time, or had you joined the church? Yeah, we had

17:59.040 --> 18:00.482
dancers. We had dancers. We had dancers, you know, 
this, this, this, quite a quantity. We had

18:06.171 --> 18:10.418
dancers, 32 on the set, and 24 on the set. They had 
this thing called Tommy's Apartment, and dancing

18:11.039 --> 18:16.588
apartment I got in, Tommy's Swing. All that kind of 
stuff, you understand, see? And, uh, he probably

18:18.840 --> 18:21.524
went to the bar. He had a bar, you know, where they 
bought candy and so on, I guess, you know. And

18:23.846 --> 18:28.011
apples and oranges, you understand, he'd carry a 
pot and spin a dime or a quarter on it and buy him

18:23.846 --> 18:28.011
candy. I'll cook something, I guess, you know. You 
know, he had no silverware, you understand. He

18:31.575 --> 18:33.858
had, uh, lemonade made in the barrel. He had no, 
nothing like silverware then. No more

18:36.741 --> 18:37.282
silverware. Did you all sing any songs at those 
dances while you were doing the quadrille and the

18:38.043 --> 18:42.168
promenade? No, I didn't sing. I had to think about 
dancing and hooping hollies. Did you have anybody

18:46.235 --> 18:47.577
to call figures? Oh, yes, indeed. I had a fellow 
here. He played my band's call figures. A fellow

18:51.944 --> 18:52.805
named Hicks Singleton. He did now. He was 
naturally a smart fellow. He was about my age. He

18:57.533 --> 18:58.134
was a jolly fellow. He knew all that kind of stuff, 
that dancing stuff, you know. I never was a dancer.

19:03.182 --> 19:05.305
I played myself in music. I liked music. Did you 
play for these dancers? Oh, yes, yeah. Yes, sir.

19:11.836 --> 19:13.879
Well, what year did you leave the... and leave 
Davis' band? Davis' band left Davis' band in the

19:15.876 --> 19:18.479
year of 84. Now Davis' band came out here from 
Fiskeburg. And we come to Fiskeburg and stayed

19:21.742 --> 19:24.424
there till the 87. And come out here and get in touch 
with Mason McGinnis, his father-in-law, who was

19:24.525 --> 19:30.670
one of the supervisors of the old company. He was a 
white man at the time, see. And give him this part of

19:32.932 --> 19:37.036
this land where he could dig out up here and make it 
to the new city with his Negroes. And they got him

19:37.977 --> 19:40.519
caught up here and dug this land. And I came with me 
and another boy named Sheldon Allen. his father,

19:43.745 --> 19:48.311
his third father, my father, Peter Montgomery. He 
had 12 countries, you understand. And he lost his

19:50.554 --> 19:55.281
land, you understand, up to December. In January, 
he moved a few times here. His mother was the first

20:00.287 --> 20:02.911
one to cook bread here. Cooked bread here in 87, on a 
stump. Cooked bread on a stump. And now he had

20:08.278 --> 20:08.919
bread. Now he had bread. In July 12, he even came up 
big break up here, got a train at Marigold. Walked

20:16.753 --> 20:18.275
up here, you understand? And the men had made some 
stairs, course tires. They took the sliders,

20:22.161 --> 20:26.167
picked them up, and made a shack. And that easy man 
should cook that bread on the stump. That's the

20:27.709 --> 20:28.671
push of the shack. Right out of the stump, he made a 
big fire. We made a big fire for it and put both

20:30.574 --> 20:35.942
coals, put it on the stump, and put the skillet on 
there, you understand? Put the lid on the skillet

20:36.543 --> 20:40.088
and put the coal on top of the lid and make that 
bread. That way you got the first bread. That's the

20:42.311 --> 20:42.912
87th. How many years has it been? Fifty-four 
years. Fifty-four years. That's right. That's

20:50.224 --> 20:51.786
right. I pulled a chain from this country for five 
years. That line is out there. Run that line there.

20:57.154 --> 20:59.257
Run your 36-mile league. I pulled that chain in 88. 
And on that side, on the real road there, I pulled

21:03.083 --> 21:09.172
that line in 87. Went to San Paolo, Costa Rica. I'll 
tell you, it was about six miles away. Now, that

21:13.844 --> 21:21.174
line, Major Fontaine, the chief engineer, told 
Montgomery that this line was run by the guns of

21:13.844 --> 21:21.174
this, a hundred years ago. He said, you'll find 
different designs and different trees along this

21:22.977 --> 21:26.602
line. You can be cutting fine old lines, fine old 
stumps. We go in the tree, and I found a gun by the

21:30.267 --> 21:38.920
tree, granted with some axes, and found a bottle in 
the tree, and all people wanted to eat that bottle.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.867
And they couldn't get all that paper and put it on 
this book, you understand? Very well, it wouldn't

21:43.087 --> 21:45.009
be because I cut the tree, you understand, see? And 
they put another chip back in that tree. That tree

21:47.732 --> 21:49.013
just cut out here, you fool there. Yes, sir. Now, 
that line runs from a land to a city group. Doesn't

21:53.939 --> 21:54.319
stop. Every county has its state. It has its own 
supply. It has its own supply. That line down there

21:59.805 --> 22:04.190
runs all this land from here to Shelby to your white 
land. From here to Marygrove to your white land.

22:07.081 --> 22:08.943
Cutting the canes, surveying, I had no team on 
that. Just, just being a little bit by. Full team

22:11.325 --> 22:12.226
cutting out there. Major Thornton. Major 
Thornton was the chief in there. Well, how many

22:16.531 --> 22:19.474
families were here the next year? Next year? Oh, we 
got, we had about 15 families the next year. Just

22:25.199 --> 22:26.981
about 15 families. Next year, we had about 15 
families come here. About, that's been now the

22:28.963 --> 22:30.665
next year. Becoming advertised, you understand, 
getting people to come here. They come from the old

22:34.013 --> 22:36.336
country, the South, you understand, see? 
Kootenai, they had them come by letter and by

22:36.997 --> 22:40.001
advertising paper. Newspaper, you understand? 
They had the paper out there. After the trip that I

22:42.744 --> 22:45.388
got, you know, he's trying to tell me all around the 
country. They all come here on account of

22:45.868 --> 22:47.330
Kootenai. They know what he's trying to do. Tell 
all the folks in the land. Come to Daisy Bend, where

22:50.334 --> 22:51.976
we left Daisy Bend. They all come to the bend. They 
come across the road to Newtown, out of the Asian

22:53.758 --> 22:57.463
Hills, from Peaksburg. Come back to Kootenai 
because they know what he's trying to do. Give them

23:00.527 --> 23:01.168
all a home. And they bought that land, and it's gone 
now. The land here

23:05.356 --> 23:09.822
is supposed to be gone. Yes, sir. Well, when would 
you say that you had your greatest prosperity

23:10.122 --> 23:13.106
here? Greatest prosperity? In life we had here 
when Cousin I.S.U. lived, and Charles Banks, and

23:16.850 --> 23:19.654
John Francis. It was the life of Mount Byrd. And 
since they're gone, why is Mount Byrd gone?

23:27.603 --> 23:28.464
There's no backbone. There's no backbone in this 
curriculum here at all. You need somebody to get in

23:31.473 --> 23:32.875
front. Every gang has to have a leader. If a gang of 
chickens can't have a leader, well, they got no

23:36.101 --> 23:39.626
leader, you understand. So you need leadership. 
That's what they ain't got. Well, did you form a

23:43.633 --> 23:45.917
band when you came here to Mount Byard? Yes, sir. We 
were two bands here. Two brass bands. Yes, sir. And

23:51.045 --> 23:55.873
the first teacher of that band we had, a fellow from 
my home, told him to send his band down home there.

23:56.314 --> 23:56.875
He's a young fella. Named Wilster. He played in a 
band down there when I was quite big, I played in a

23:59.013 --> 24:01.616
band. About to go with the band, you understand. 
And he, when he come up there, you understand, he

24:03.839 --> 24:08.285
said, let's get up in the band. I said, all right. 
And we saved a little money, and we started the line

24:09.607 --> 24:16.797
here in Chicago, and bought a band on, part on 
Crave, $750. And give it a chance to pay for it, you

24:17.738 --> 24:19.180
understand, see. And we bought that band and 
started playing, started learning how to play

24:19.901 --> 24:22.665
good music. I kind of knew really, and he knew 
already, And matter of fact, yes, London had a good

24:25.456 --> 24:27.179
band. They had a band of 14 boys. And the other boys 
were working in stands and ties like that. I was

24:32.747 --> 24:36.593
pulling the chains through the swamps, 
surveying, recognizing, but never getting

24:32.747 --> 24:36.593
music. And after that band were out, the place was 
long, I come to run a saloon there. Well, see, that

24:41.560 --> 24:42.782
old man's been green. Next man I had in London, I had 
that band practicing there in a saloon. I was

24:47.610 --> 24:49.593
running a saloon for 50. I took a young band in 
there, you understand. That band came here a few

24:51.956 --> 24:53.218
years ago. That band's all gone now. Well, what 
sort of pieces were you playing about 1890? Do you

24:59.769 --> 25:00.410
remember? Oh, I played the same piece we played 
down yonder. I learned the very same music. Very

25:04.796 --> 25:05.697
same music. 10th and 12th grade music. I learned 
it. I had a piece that a white band gave me in

25:08.821 --> 25:12.126
Cleveland. They couldn't play it. And they gave it 
to me. And I come up here and took my band and played

25:15.791 --> 25:17.513
it. And came out and played it to them. Yes. Played 
it to them. I know it was a man's name. A man gave it to

25:22.400 --> 25:22.961
me. His name was Scott Johnson. He was snagged on 
Peter, but he was a man of the band. He said, George,

25:27.621 --> 25:30.124
we can't play, but give it to y'all. And he gave it to 
me. But if he had played that week, the next week he

25:32.727 --> 25:37.113
had to go clean with some other and play with them 
down there.

25:40.537 --> 25:43.501
Man, I want to hear a quick march. I want to hear it. I 
want to hear a quick march. I never care. It's a

25:48.087 --> 25:49.749
heartbeat minute. I want to hear a quick march. 
Yeah, an eavescake walk is the hardest thing I ever

25:52.649 --> 25:55.373
played in my life. What is that? An eavescake walk. 
Eavescake walk? Yes, the hardest thing I ever

25:57.175 --> 25:59.418
played in my life. Felt great stuff. Yes, sir. I 
can't do anything but tonguing and fingering.

26:03.843 --> 26:04.304
Yes, sir. It's all practice solo, every bit of 
solo. I never played a sight on my life. I played a

26:11.253 --> 26:12.695
tuba and a cornet. I can play them now. I don't count 
my teeth. One bit, two bits. Yes, sir. Do you have,

26:21.438 --> 26:25.323
uh, did you all have a dance hall here at Mount Bio? 
Used to, yes, sir. We had a dance hall. A nice dance

26:29.268 --> 26:30.009
hall. We had a dance hall in the low stairs. I'm 
trying to lie down, sit down there a piece. I found I

26:35.957 --> 26:39.682
got wet down by a train one day. Couldn't leave it. 
Wind was spots on, on the chin on top of the roof,

26:41.304 --> 26:44.288
dry. And such a fire, couldn't put out. Just 
managed to get some other tools out of that lodge,

26:47.793 --> 26:50.196
and that's all we done. Well,

26:50.530 --> 27:03.869
what do you think of a town like this? Do you think 
that because people can run a town like this? They

27:09.557 --> 27:11.760
can, but they ain't here now. They ain't here now. 
You can't get a cross-dye if you ain't got timber.

27:17.388 --> 27:19.170
You've got to have timber to get the cross-dye. You 
can't get a bull that's seen like this that's got

27:19.471 --> 27:23.155
timber to make it out of. If the timber's rotten, 
dirty, a worm-bitten wormhole there, hit him with

27:23.175 --> 27:28.400
a door. You take a bull with a full wormhole, he's 
going to go on the ice at least. Seriously, in this

27:32.384 --> 27:34.145
country. With a wormhole. At least. That's 
perfect talk. Sir, you've got to have hard timber.

27:43.194 --> 27:46.337
You can't think to go out the door with a shoe on your 
foot and a hole in the bottom. You've got to get your

27:46.357 --> 27:47.318
foot wet. Well, how

27:48.293 --> 28:18.047
long have you been a member of the church?
