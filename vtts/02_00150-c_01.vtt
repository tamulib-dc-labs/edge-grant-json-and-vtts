WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:17.974
that they could interact with their colleagues in 
related disciplines, particularly in the

00:02.377 --> 00:17.974
breeding world, genetic improvement. And I think 
that was a sound

00:17.994 --> 00:25.322
decision. But the net effect of starting that 
competitive grants program did two things. One,

00:34.609 --> 00:42.421
it got us way down the road as far as the quality of 
science is concerned in the experiment station.

00:43.222 --> 00:49.632
And two, it made our faculty much more competitive 
for external funds. And this year, and that impact

00:50.794 --> 00:58.506
is still being felt because this year the 
Experiment Station brought in sixty million

00:59.279 --> 01:04.908
dollars in external funds. And that number has 
been going up since 1983 or whenever we started.

01:15.223 --> 01:20.611
The second thing we did, I think, came along later. 
This was after Charlie Hartson got here. Charlie

01:25.318 --> 01:26.400
was but he had some good ideas, he just had a hard 
time getting them implemented. But we did start

01:36.828 --> 01:44.917
the crop biotechnology program and the facility 
out there on the west campus now. And that's turned

01:45.938 --> 01:51.004
out to be a real winner for us.

01:53.077 --> 02:13.875
first-rate, cutting-edge science, lab space, 
and those guys are getting money out of the

01:53.077 --> 02:13.875
National Genome Program and this sort of thing 
now, so they're much more competitive than they

01:53.077 --> 02:13.875
have been in the past.

02:13.895 --> 02:21.582
As the Associate Director, your view, your 
responsibility reached entirely all across And

02:22.338 --> 02:38.307
would it be correct to say you were the person most 
likely to be in the office day after day after day

02:22.338 --> 02:38.307
while Neville Clark as the director was more on the 
road? Well, yeah, that's the way it worked out. I

02:42.254 --> 02:46.101
traveled a good bit, but he was...

02:48.089 --> 02:57.623
He was in pretty high demand in the state, and of 
course when the legislature was in session, you

02:48.089 --> 02:57.623
know, how that goes. Was

02:59.625 --> 03:13.625
Brian Neville the spy on Hayes and she was the judge 
of the... Neville is probably the brightest, most

02:59.625 --> 03:13.625
organized guy I ever ran into in my life. He has a... 
a pretty short string. He doesn't tolerate poor

03:21.373 --> 03:37.237
performance or what he views as

03:21.373 --> 03:37.237
idle time or whatever you want to call it. He works 
like hell and if you try to keep up with him you'll

03:38.779 --> 03:43.746
kill yourself. But he is tremendously

03:44.688 --> 03:53.326
productive. I've never seen a guy more productive 
in my life. He'll come out of a meeting and going

04:01.546 --> 04:18.709
his, well, right now, he started out taking notes 
on his laptop, and people began to become offended

04:01.546 --> 04:18.709
by the clickety-clickety-click on that laptop. 
But in those days, before we had laptops, he would

04:19.430 --> 04:29.764
get in his office and transcribe his notes and have 
a, have those in the hands of all the participants

04:30.571 --> 04:37.962
within

04:30.571 --> 04:37.962
24 hours. He could just get things done well and get 
them done in a hurry. Let's see, I just realized one

04:43.170 --> 04:45.954
of the things we overlooked. Let's go back to the 
department building days. Who were the key staff

04:48.638 --> 04:56.730
persons in the department head's office in those 
years that you were department head? The

04:57.065 --> 05:02.492
departmental secretary and the bookkeeper. Oh, 
gosh, I had a bunch of them. The first one

05:06.358 --> 05:21.098
was departmental secretary was Susan Beale, who 
is Mike Beale's wife, who is on the city council of

05:06.358 --> 05:21.098
Bryant.

05:23.052 --> 05:28.678
And I can't remember, oh the bookkeeper was a lady 
by the name of Betty Carter. She stayed with the

05:28.738 --> 05:39.329
department a long time after I, well after I left. 
But then I went to several other departmental

05:39.489 --> 05:48.638
secretaries as you tend to do. Being a small 
department, the good ones tend to get picked off by

05:48.820 --> 05:57.068
the larger departments. I remember Salt and Crop 
Science rated us one time for our departmental

05:57.989 --> 06:04.495
secretary.

06:07.678 --> 06:12.943
You mentioned Horace Byers. Do you have any 
impression of him as the chief academic officer?

06:18.132 --> 06:19.254
Not really. My contact with him was fairly 
limited. Harry and I would go over there when we had

06:23.081 --> 06:36.764
some business to do with him, and he struck me as 
being pretty businesslike and not much small

06:23.081 --> 06:36.764
talk. Thank you, and that was it. What about a 
fellow named John Calvin?

06:46.938 --> 06:56.833
Yeah, I've had a number of engagements with John, 
and I really like him. And we've come to appreciate

06:57.254 --> 07:05.286
him more in the later years of our association than 
early on. But he could be tough.

07:14.579 --> 07:28.965
I can't remember a particular incident, but you 
just have feelings about people, how you want to

07:14.579 --> 07:28.965
approach them and how you want to deal with them. I 
always felt that you wanted to deal with John

07:29.045 --> 07:34.815
fairly carefully. But I gained the respect for him 
and appreciated him. Chuckling because working

07:42.913 --> 07:52.106
for him for about five years, and those were the 
brightest, most exhilarating years of my life.

07:53.788 --> 08:06.186
And how quickly he could work through a stack of 
mail and come to a pretty clear decision that

07:53.788 --> 08:06.186
almost never did I want to second guess. Did you 
have any impression of Dr. Williams? Oh, I didn't

08:12.718 --> 08:26.459
have that much association with him, although I 
was sitting right next to him at the board meeting

08:12.718 --> 08:26.459
when he announced his resignation. And I'll never 
forget that. Well, you know, the board sits around

08:29.875 --> 08:45.536
their table, and there was a table down at the south 
end of the room there,

08:29.875 --> 08:45.536
and it had two or three chairs around it. And for 
some reason, he and I were sitting there. I don't

08:49.121 --> 08:50.162
remember why. And the hangers on at board meetings 
tend to gather around the edges there and be ready

08:51.222 --> 09:06.465
to look intelligent when called upon and that sort 
of thing. But we were just cruising along there.

09:10.731 --> 09:14.858
They were going through the agenda and reached a 
particular point. I don't remember when, but he

09:14.878 --> 09:19.204
said, I guess a

09:19.927 --> 09:25.192
guy from Granbury. Howard Wilde. Yeah, Clyde 
Wilde.

09:33.559 --> 09:45.409
Asked him to let him say something, and

09:33.559 --> 09:45.409
Clyde Wilde said, yes, I will be. Announced that he 
intended to resign as chancellor. What do you call

09:47.931 --> 09:49.933
wisdom in the action? It was very quiet.

09:58.951 --> 10:00.052
Very quiet. That would have been, if I'm not 
mistaken, about 7 or 8. Right. It was late 77 or

10:07.599 --> 10:10.062
early 78. I can't remember exactly when. All 
right. Let's back up then. Dr. Miller, Jarvis

10:18.483 --> 10:27.976
Miller moved from being Director of the 
Experiment Station to being President in late 76.

10:28.157 --> 10:33.925
Calhoun resigned and Matt Prescott appointed as 
the new Vice President. That's right. How did that

10:36.068 --> 10:41.435
affect you over in the Experiment Station, those 
changes? Well, significantly because

10:49.482 --> 11:02.261
What happened then, certainly when Jack Williams 
resigned, Jarvis literally took over as

10:49.482 --> 11:02.261
chancellor. I mean, as far as the agencies were 
concerned. And so when we wanted to do business at

11:06.147 --> 11:16.221
that level, we did business with Jarvis. Prior to 
that time, you had been reporting the station has

11:19.638 --> 11:21.801
been reporting to Dr. Wiggins. That's right. Did 
it make any difference in the way the station

11:23.704 --> 11:31.456
actually operated at that point? Did it make any 
difference where it reported? Not really, except

11:35.101 --> 11:44.515
there was about a year there where the Folks out in 
the state who had an association with Jarvis when

11:45.592 --> 11:58.767
he was Experiment Station Director all began to 
huddle around. We couldn't go anywhere. And if

12:00.790 --> 12:07.217
Jarvis went with us, I remember one time we went 
down to visit H.B. Zachary. And my goodness, you

12:09.119 --> 12:15.126
never saw such a clamor in your life. Aggie Button 
was rung in his office and all that. Aggies were

12:20.333 --> 12:27.764
told to report to the classroom or to the 
conference room and, you know, and it was that kind

12:20.333 --> 12:27.764
of stuff going on. So there was somewhat of a 
distraction while Jarvis

12:39.052 --> 12:47.762
you know, carry the title as president of the 
university, he functioned in a broader context

12:39.052 --> 12:47.762
than that. Right. Now, then Frank Huber becomes 
the chancellor. Right. And soon there was a tussle

12:53.249 --> 13:01.259
between him and President Miller over where... 
The boundary was, yeah. And I presume we all

13:04.162 --> 13:07.506
sometimes kind of in the... caught in the middle of 
that flight? Yeah.

13:14.746 --> 13:21.295
Where do you think the station would have 
preferred to report? Well, I think of course, let

13:21.315 --> 13:26.182
me mention one other thing.

13:31.049 --> 13:36.196
Jarvis had not been in job long until he brought 
Perry and O.D. in as his vice president for

13:38.300 --> 13:46.492
agriculture and vice president for whatever. And 
so that began to, you know, those guys tried to find

13:47.914 --> 13:57.989
their place in the Sun because those were totally 
new positions. And, of course, he did, I guess, the

13:59.270 --> 14:04.278
same thing over in engineering. Fred Benson, I 
guess, was vice president. Uh-huh. And they were

14:09.856 --> 14:15.821
certainly OD and Perry were trying to figure out 
what to do. And of course, the tendency when you

14:17.183 --> 14:28.233
don't know what to do is to go start looking at the 
folks that are working for you and find out what

14:17.183 --> 14:28.233
they're doing. Well, they came down and, or Perry 
came down and put the arm on the level and said, you

14:28.253 --> 14:37.942
know, I think I'll be running the experiment 
station. But that's where it was. But, uh...

15:01.983 --> 15:10.993
But that lingered, that had lingering effects on 
the period of the Gaines-Chester.

15:12.615 --> 15:22.847
I

15:12.615 --> 15:22.847
went to the summer of 1908. In the spring of 1908, 
it's been about a year. meeting

15:24.612 --> 15:50.569
formally and informally with Vice President 
Prescott and with President Miller fairly often,

15:24.612 --> 15:50.569
began to realize there was a real 
behind-the-scenes discussion going on about

15:24.612 --> 15:50.569
where the stations and services reported. And Dr. 
Miller wanted to report to him, and then he to the

15:50.589 --> 15:51.991
Chancellor. Would you like to get more things for 
y'all being caught in the middle of that I think the

15:56.354 --> 16:08.969
problem there was sort of diffused a bit by the fact 
that Perry and O.D. were sitting there. Neville

16:11.352 --> 16:20.083
reported Perry.

16:21.160 --> 16:28.710
Dan Funstiel, I guess, who was the Director of 
Extension then, and Fred Benson and so on. And so

16:29.911 --> 16:47.995
that,

16:29.911 --> 16:47.995
I don't recall, you know, we used to, there was 
flack, no question about it, and we used to get

16:29.911 --> 16:47.995
caught up in some of it, but we moved along pretty 
good. But I don't think it slowed us down. I drove

16:53.391 --> 17:08.886
away to town Tuesday right after lunch, and Dr. 
Miller learned late the next afternoon that he was

16:53.391 --> 17:08.886
being terminated. Were you and your key 
associates aware that that termination was about

17:08.907 --> 17:15.433
to occur? Are you at liberty to say when or how y'all 
came away? Well, it came from the board. Were you

17:24.969 --> 17:27.753
aware of that in advance? Yes. And the word was 
coming out of the board that they were getting

17:30.536 --> 17:40.088
ready to terminate me. Chuckie.

17:56.474 --> 18:02.404
Right.

18:02.424 --> 18:03.325
Right. See, Perry and O.D. were made deputy 
chancellors somewhere during that time, during

18:07.265 --> 18:18.577
that, after Jarvis was terminated. Did 
Chancellor Huber change anything about the

18:18.597 --> 18:25.965
direction of agriculture? No. So that y'all were 
able to then operate as you thought best. What

18:32.633 --> 18:38.526
about with any of his successors, any of the other 
chancellors he followed? No, there was, you know,

18:39.788 --> 18:52.323
Haskell areas, about every four or five years, the 
issue of where the service was ought to report

18:39.788 --> 18:52.323
comes up. And it's still, you know, kind of on the 
table now, or recently. And so that used to pop up

18:59.232 --> 19:03.417
with Hanson. with Chancellor and all the 
questions came up. And Hanson had been president

19:08.221 --> 19:14.107
of Purdue, where he had everything. And he's 
covered there. And he didn't understand why this

19:16.309 --> 19:20.793
ought to be different. And one day, we were 
briefing him on something. I forgot what it was.

19:26.117 --> 19:31.142
And we were up there in the conference room in 
Williamsville. And all of a sudden, he slammed his

19:31.291 --> 19:35.697
hand down on the tabletop. Now I understand. Now I 
understand. So, you know,

19:42.185 --> 19:58.566
nobody really dabbled in our business during that 
period of time. And I think Frank Vandiver... I had

20:01.244 --> 20:03.046
no interest whatsoever. I don't, you know, 
Neville would go, you know, sit with him every now

20:04.447 --> 20:22.547
and then over areas of mutual concern or interest, 
and he was always polite and cordial and

20:04.447 --> 20:22.547
everything, but he wasn't that mean. I was back on 
campus in the 80s visiting, and he heard I was here,

20:23.368 --> 20:30.255
and he invited me over to his office. and

20:31.248 --> 20:49.493
he said he had been hassled by a local group 
thinking that A&M ought to give a lot more

20:31.248 --> 20:49.493
attention to creating a strong program in fine 
arts, art, music, drama, and so forth. And he said,

20:49.513 --> 20:50.134
what do you think? I tried to put on a blank face, and 
I said, well, let me ask you a question, too, before

20:51.683 --> 21:00.288
I respond. You were able to do one chip, yes, sir, 
you said. I said, describe your program in fine

21:01.859 --> 21:07.266
arts at Purdue. And he said, oh, no, that would go 
with Indiana University. I said, oh, oh, oh, well,

21:10.249 --> 21:16.217
describe the quality of the engineering program 
at Indiana. He said, no, we had that at Purdue. I

21:19.781 --> 21:25.668
said, oh, you mean in Indiana it was clearly 
delineated which programs were on which campus.

21:25.688 --> 21:26.449
He said, oh, that's right. I said, oh, okay. I said, 
I don't believe that UT Austin has a really good

21:28.534 --> 21:35.221
program in agriculture. And so I told him I had no 
further advice than that. It was because I was

21:38.404 --> 21:46.393
concerned about how much money it would take to 
create a high-quality program in the town. That's

21:46.413 --> 21:51.598
such a high spike and a step in the time that I 
thought it would take a while to get it. The...

21:54.830 --> 22:10.066
Describe any opinions you had about the various 
presidents after Jarvis, their relationship to

21:54.830 --> 22:10.066
the Experiment Station and their interest in it. 
Presidents, that would be Frank Vandiver, Bill

22:12.348 --> 22:21.057
Mobley, We

22:22.252 --> 22:35.071
had some interims. Who else was in there before 
Ray? I guess just interims.

22:46.349 --> 22:56.258
Our relationships were, of course, Bill was both 
president and subsequently chancellor, and our

22:46.349 --> 22:56.258
relationships were okay then. If you could have 
the total authority to decide the organizational

22:56.758 --> 23:10.691
structure, where would you have the stations and 
the services report? To the chancellor. What

23:14.463 --> 23:20.494
about then the dean of agriculture? To whom would 
he report? To the provost. Okay. What about his

23:27.166 --> 23:29.971
relation then to the station? Well, we've 
attempted to solve that problem by nesting all of

23:31.213 --> 23:39.087
those titles in one person. And that's one model 
you find around the countryside. A&M is a big

23:46.045 --> 23:59.185
organization, so you've got to take that into 
consideration when you think about what model

23:46.045 --> 23:59.185
might work.

24:00.076 --> 24:15.030
really are the one we have here where all of the 
titles are invested in one person or the agencies

24:00.076 --> 24:15.030
are split up and you have one vice whatever. and 
then one for academics, one for research, one for

24:15.297 --> 24:27.475
extension, and then the other smaller agencies. 
But I think Ed Heiler's shortfall is that he's

24:27.495 --> 24:40.174
about to kill himself. He

24:40.947 --> 24:56.048
doesn't delegate enough of the responsibilities 
to his staff, immediate staff,

24:40.947 --> 24:56.048
to get the job done. And so it slows things down and 
it's hard on him. But that's a matter of execution,

25:03.319 --> 25:09.267
not necessarily the wrong model to have. Were you 
still active when Perry Edgerson was the

25:09.550 --> 25:13.334
chancellor? Yes. All right. Now, he's a superb 
researcher, coming certainly out of the working

25:14.516 --> 25:21.044
level. How would you evaluate his understanding 
of all these matters when he was chancellor?

25:30.275 --> 25:34.920
Oh, I'd say excellent.

25:35.601 --> 25:38.224
He knew more about the... the experiment station, 
the extension service, they had a fairly small

25:39.200 --> 25:46.452
teaching program over there in entomology. So his 
experience was mostly with the agencies. And so

25:52.122 --> 26:01.377
when he ended up over as vice president with Jarvis 
and then ultimately as chancellor, his

26:02.420 --> 26:13.122
association with the agencies and services, I 
think an understanding of them was better than

26:02.420 --> 26:13.122
probably understanding the university by a 
bunch. And about that time, you know, all of these

26:13.843 --> 26:23.803
other universities began to flow in, at least the 
first wave of them. Now, did the expansion of the

26:24.880 --> 26:35.255
Texas A&M system, did that affect the role that you 
and your colleagues played in the experiment

26:24.880 --> 26:35.255
station? Well, yes, but it didn't happen until Ed 
Heiler became Vice Chancellor. And early on, he

26:47.413 --> 26:50.297
said, and it's the responsibility of the agencies 
to embrace these other campuses because we have

26:51.172 --> 27:12.413
almost a matchup with them with our centers

26:51.172 --> 27:12.413
at Corpus Christi and West Texas State and so on. 
And we can do that better than anybody else can. And

27:17.658 --> 27:19.980
so I'm committed. to

27:20.652 --> 27:28.022
establishing an association with the other 
campuses. So he spent a lot of time and effort at

27:28.042 --> 27:30.586
that. And based on the conference we just had and 
the attendance from these other universities,

27:30.967 --> 27:40.901
he's still working at it pretty hard. As far as you 
know, could a faculty member with the appropriate

27:41.602 --> 27:50.254
intellectual background at UT, I mean at A&M 
International at Laredo, or at A&M Commerce,

27:51.314 --> 28:13.643
could they submit a proposal to the experiment 
station and have a fair chance of getting a grant?

28:13.963 --> 28:20.832
If the experiment station awarded grants 
anymore, yeah. The old system that I described to

28:21.318 --> 28:35.915
you a while ago that Neville started when he 
scooped up a bunch of money over at the

28:21.318 --> 28:35.915
legislature, between Charlie Harnson and Ed 
Heiler, that money's about gone.

28:39.119 --> 28:42.123
But there's a little bit of it left. And the last 
attempt to award grant, yeah. these folks were

28:50.191 --> 29:05.612
asked and they were asked to do it in an 
interdisciplinary sense with other folks at the

28:50.191 --> 29:05.612
Dallas Center and the Peace and Commerce or at 
Overton. And Prairie View and Tarleton have been

29:06.533 --> 29:12.461
down through the years. Right. Now, as far as you 
know, the Extension Service theoretically would

29:13.222 --> 29:19.270
offer them the same possibility? I think under 
Hyler's directorship they would, but not before.

29:29.650 --> 29:38.608
In general, if you could give advice to the 
leadership Texas A&M today in the broad field of

29:39.230 --> 29:44.358
agriculture. If you could advise A&M and Forestry 
today, what would you advise them to do in addition

29:45.440 --> 29:54.054
to what's already been done? How does A&M move 
forward in Forestry from where it is today? I think

30:01.065 --> 30:04.731
they need a stronger resource base. And I'm 
thinking about a capital campaign type effort.

30:11.254 --> 30:17.842
And one is in the making through the university. 
And the department ought to really take advantage

30:17.862 --> 30:31.039
of that and work with some of the foundations in the 
state to develop a strong resource base. Parts of

30:31.492 --> 30:40.240
agriculture did okay the last capital campaign, 
but the department, and it was a function of the

30:31.492 --> 30:40.240
department head. It was just something he wasn't 
interested in doing. All right, and should they

30:42.842 --> 30:46.546
put that in the capital projects or endowment? 
Endowment, yeah. I'm on your side on that. Yeah,

30:50.830 --> 30:51.810
yeah. Because I think the state ought to look to the 
state to do the bricks and mortar. Oh, yeah.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.279
Because otherwise the money is gone. Do you think 
that some of the foundations and private industry

31:01.951 --> 31:08.780
might be receptive? Oh, I think so. I think so. But, 
golly, you've got to have an organized approach

31:12.485 --> 31:27.064
and

31:12.485 --> 31:27.064
use the resources of the foundation and this sort 
of thing to go do that. Would you also advise

31:27.230 --> 31:36.269
the department to make any changes in its research 
and teaching? Are there some new areas of emphasis

31:36.390 --> 31:43.986
that it ought to add? Not really.
