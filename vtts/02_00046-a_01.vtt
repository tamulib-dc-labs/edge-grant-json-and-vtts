testing This is Mike Coconose. I'm sitting here

00:32.403 --> 00:36.027
with Dr. Haskell Monroe.

00:40.691 --> 00:41.051
Okay. And it's Michael? Well, I was baptized, 
Michael, in a Greek Orthodox church. You're

00:46.837 --> 00:48.819
right, but I go by Mike. I have a son named Michael. 
Class of 43. Correct. To begin with, please

00:53.763 --> 00:59.429
describe your family and their background. When 
did they get to Beaumont? Who came and when? Tell me

01:03.745 --> 01:04.826
about your background. I'm one of five children in 
my father and mother's home. My father came to

01:12.939 --> 01:19.549
Beaumont, Texas around 1905 from Greece. And the 
reason he came here, he had two of his fellow

01:20.542 --> 01:37.572
countrymen came to the Beaumont area, but they 
were to LaBelle, Texas, which is about five miles

01:20.542 --> 01:37.572
outside of Beaumont, and worked for the White's 
Ranch. And actually they were cowboys, Greek

01:38.311 --> 01:42.401
cowboys, and they loved it. They enjoyed it so much 
they wrote my father and told him how good it was.

01:46.070 --> 01:52.405
And so, Papa came to, landed at Galveston. and came 
on into Beaumont and went to LaBelle and worked

01:53.330 --> 01:58.316
about 30 days. And he said it wasn't for him. So he 
came into Beaumont, and he and a couple other

02:01.501 --> 02:16.941
friends of his from Greece opened up a restaurant 
in the late teens. But before that, he did work as a

02:17.481 --> 02:22.628
water boy out at Spindletop. There was a lot of 
activity going on then after the 1901 Gusher,

02:23.587 --> 02:29.817
Lucas Gusher. And so he came into Beaumont, opened 
up the restaurant, went back to Greece, a place

02:40.360 --> 02:43.705
called Epiros. There's a northern part of Greece 
next to Albania. Spell that, Epiros. Epiros,

02:48.251 --> 02:51.997
E-P-R-I-O-S, Epiros. And his hometown is Parga, 
P-A-R-G-A. And he went and he promised my mother, I

02:56.443 --> 03:03.353
get chill bumps when I think about it, I'd come back 
and get you. And he did. who kept his word and my

03:05.420 --> 03:12.208
father was a very honest and dedicated father. 
Went back, married Mama, brought her to Beaumont

03:12.749 --> 03:17.055
and started having children then. And then he had 
to give up the restaurant during the Depression

03:17.095 --> 03:28.349
and he went to work for Purity Bakery Company. He 
was a bread salesman. He delivered and sold bread

03:30.209 --> 03:35.137
to restaurants downtown Beaumont. He knew them 
all and so they did it. And my father, in 1932, and I

03:38.963 --> 03:49.500
don't know who was with him and I don't have any idea 
how he did it, came to A&M. and saw in him and looked

03:50.189 --> 03:53.454
it over. Saw all the military uniforms and 
everything. And he came home, and I was about 12 or

03:57.300 --> 04:07.416
13 years old, and he told my mother in Greek, this is 
the college where I want our children to go. And I

04:08.998 --> 04:18.593
heard him tell Mama that in Greek, and that's one of 
the real reasons my older brothers came here. And

04:19.180 --> 04:23.605
Mike Halbooty had some influence on Janelle, my 
older brother. He was the class of 37. And Mike

04:27.409 --> 04:31.754
Halbooty lived about half a block down the street. 
His dad ran a very fine grocery store. This was in

04:35.538 --> 04:37.200
the 20s and 30s. Now, Mr. Halbooty's background, 
Lebanese? Lebanese. But Lebanese and Greek, that

04:41.624 --> 04:43.546
was okay. That was fine. His father came from 
Beirut, Lebanon, and his mother was half, the way I

04:44.948 --> 05:00.596
understand it, was half Greek and half Lebanese, 
and his father married her in Lebanon and brought

04:44.948 --> 05:00.596
her into Beaumont, Texas. That's a very unique 
family. I'm sure you probably know a lot more than I

05:02.300 --> 05:08.070
do about it, but the youngest The youngest student 
to attend Tulane Medical School was Mike's

05:08.287 --> 05:15.919
brother, Manet. He was about 16 or 17 years old. 
Anyway, they lived down the street and Papa

05:19.565 --> 05:30.221
always, never said much after that about A&M 
because my older brother went and so he figured

05:19.565 --> 05:30.221
that was it. You went to Beaumont High School? I was 
a graduate of Beaumont High in 1937. and I had an

05:36.400 --> 05:40.227
offer of two basketball scholarships. One at 
Baylor and one at A&M. The one at Baylor was very

05:42.952 --> 05:45.096
great. It was a full-blown scholarship for four 
years. My coach at Beaumont High was Raymond

05:48.823 --> 05:51.267
Alford. He was an all-American a football player 
and basketball player for Baylor. And he wanted me

05:55.911 --> 05:57.593
to go to Baylor. And I had an offer from A&M, and it 
was a part-time thing. They took one football

06:01.898 --> 06:04.962
scholarship and split it five ways. And so they 
offered me a scholarship. This is in 37. I couldn't

06:10.849 --> 06:12.871
go to college. I couldn't leave home because Papa 
was having a hard time two brothers were at A&M,

06:16.546 --> 06:21.393
brother and sister at home, and Papa just 
struggling. And so I stayed home and worked two

06:21.914 --> 06:29.044
years, never kept a paycheck, never had a bank 
account, anything. Every time I walked in with my

06:29.465 --> 06:33.611
paycheck, here, Papa, and give it to him. And then 
in 39, I enrolled at A&M and I went looking for my

06:41.437 --> 06:45.724
scholarship and showed up. It was waiting for me. 
They kept it. And that's why... Had you visited A&M

06:48.829 --> 06:54.117
before coming up here to enroll? Yeah, I'd come up 
and visit with my brothers, but it wasn't very

06:54.859 --> 07:02.170
often because transportation was a problem. 
According to When you got here, what did you think

07:03.982 --> 07:09.812
about A&M before you actually arrived? Describe 
your impression of it. Well, I never had any

07:12.622 --> 07:16.789
negative feelings about A&M. They were always 
positive because I was coming from a poor

07:16.809 --> 07:27.427
neighborhood background to an institution that 
served three meals a day and a shower. And I was

07:28.949 --> 07:30.652
thrilled to death. And when I got to A&M, of course, 
like the rest of us, we put on the uniform and No one

07:36.061 --> 07:43.189
knew where you were from or and didn't care really 
background when you came to enroll as a student.

07:43.450 --> 07:47.194
How did you get here on bus or train or hitchhiker? 
Rode the bus. Came to Beaumont from the bus. Papa

07:52.620 --> 07:53.842
didn't have a vehicle. He had a bread truck. Barely 
made it downtown and back to the bakery. No way we

07:59.148 --> 07:59.848
could. Ride it and came on the bus. And then from 
then on, hitchhiked back and forth to Beaumont. Do

08:08.710 --> 08:13.223
you remember when you came up to enroll, what did 
you bring? Clothing and what else? One small

08:16.550 --> 08:17.952
suitcase. It was underwear and socks. Oh, I went to 
a Tom McKinney shoe store, bought a pair of brown

08:22.056 --> 08:30.766
shoes as I had to have brown shoes, bought that and 
brought them with me. And that's about it. Did you

08:34.411 --> 08:38.555
come by yourself or were there some others from 
Beaumont that came on the bus together? I came by

08:38.575 --> 08:40.037
myself. Sure did. And when you got off the bus, 
describe getting from the bus to whatever

08:41.943 --> 08:48.863
dormitory you needed. Well, they dropped us off at 
Aggieland Inn, and we had to walk over to the core

08:49.028 --> 08:57.218
area. The new core area. The new core area. No 
grass, no trees, all sand, dust. And we walked in

09:06.189 --> 09:10.955
there, and they had to go register. I'm trying to 
remember now where we registered. I think it was

09:14.039 --> 09:15.441
in...

09:17.851 --> 09:19.453
Do you wear a gym? Anyway, one of those, we had to 
register an assignment at Dorm 10, A battery,

09:20.375 --> 09:26.684
field artillery. Now, how did that come about? Do 
you know? I have no idea. I didn't ask for A, but I beg

09:31.070 --> 09:33.513
pardon. I do know A battery because my brothers 
were in it. And I wanted to be in the same battery

09:36.898 --> 09:38.961
with them. But none of them were in school when you 
got here? Yeah, Jimmy was. Oh, Jimmy. He had one

09:43.868 --> 09:45.230
more year. He graduated in 1940. Did he come on the 
bus with you? No, he was already up here. Oh, okay.

09:52.973 --> 09:54.414
He was up here. Did any of your brothers give you any 
advice before you came up? No, I can't

10:02.303 --> 10:12.495
specifically say they advised me to do this, this, 
or that, but I knew from the training I had at home

10:02.303 --> 10:12.495
with Papa Mama said, I better do whatever the 
authorities told me to do, and that's what I did.

10:18.174 --> 10:20.898
And did your dad give you any advice or 
instructions? He just said, study hard, don't

10:21.499 --> 10:25.104
mess around, work. What did you think your major 
was going to be? I started off in engineering. Then

10:32.894 --> 10:36.559
I got into it, I didn't like it, and I switched over 
to pre-med. And I got a degree in pre-med, Bachelor

10:37.248 --> 10:42.617
of Science in Science.

10:45.222 --> 10:50.371
Describe how you walked into that dorm and became a 
part of that company. I walked into the dorm and

10:51.513 --> 11:00.488
first thing I know they're hollering at me, get up 
there on stoop four, it's where your room is. get it

11:00.957 --> 11:08.827
up, get it in order, make your bed up and 
everything, then come back down to stoop three, we

11:00.957 --> 11:08.827
got to find some more instructions. They were 
screaming, hollering at me when I walked in. And

11:12.732 --> 11:16.116
did that outfit have a nickname? A battery did not 
have a nickname. It did not. Describe your room,

11:20.722 --> 11:23.846
the one that you were assigned to. I was assigned a 
small a room in the dormitory and my roommate was

11:27.856 --> 11:38.320
Charlie Babcock, Jr. And we had decided when we 
left Beaumont we were going to room together. And

11:39.322 --> 11:44.835
then walked in and it was just bare room. two desks, 
two chairs, two beds, bunk beds, upper and lower,

11:45.170 --> 11:57.915
and that

11:45.170 --> 11:57.915
was about it. And were there a whole bunch of young 
men arriving at about the time you did? Oh, yeah,

12:05.523 --> 12:08.567
there was kind of a number of people coming in about 
that time. I didn't know any of them. Didn't know

12:11.070 --> 12:11.771
one. And describe what it was like the first days as 
you're getting whipped into shape and part of the

12:12.192 --> 12:21.203
Corps and going to class. Well, the first day I got 
here, we didn't have class. It was, I think I got

12:25.489 --> 12:29.775
here on a Saturday, and we had class Monday. My 
schedule was already made up. And... And there was

12:35.137 --> 12:50.097
a lot of hollering and get going, doing this, and 
the sophomores were training us how to behave as

12:35.137 --> 12:50.097
Aggies, and so it was pretty hectic over the 
weekend. But when school started Monday, we went

12:51.218 --> 12:55.764
right on into class. How did you register for 
classes that first semester?

13:05.275 --> 13:11.717
I'm trying to remember, it was, we went down, it 
wasn't a DWARE gym either. They had the

13:12.921 --> 13:16.332
registrar's office, it was located This is the 
other side of the YMCA. And we went in there and

13:20.048 --> 13:23.794
registered and selected the courses we needed. We 
didn't have any trouble getting what you wanted

13:23.814 --> 13:32.327
because there was how many, 7,000 of us were in 
there, around approximately that number. So I

13:33.048 --> 13:35.351
didn't have any trouble registering as an 
engineer. And then I changed courses in December

13:36.253 --> 13:43.163
and took the pre-med courses. That first 
semester, were there some key courses you now look

13:43.143 --> 13:53.362
back, realize that they were important, or any 
instructors that were significant? Oh, yeah, I

13:54.104 --> 13:57.911
can tell you about my English prof, Dr. Eckfeldt. 
Never forget, what a marvelous person,

13:58.873 --> 14:01.979
tremendous guy. Fred Eckfeldt. That's right. He 
was an English prof. I was so impressed with him. We

14:07.333 --> 14:13.591
walked into class and of course we're disciplined 
now and pay attention and sit straight up. He

14:14.674 --> 14:16.660
pulled out the roll And there was about 32 of us in 
the class, or 30. And he called the roll and he said,

14:20.150 --> 14:24.599
I want you to stand up when I call your name. Mike 
Coconos. I stood up, sat down. Went right on down

14:28.526 --> 14:29.849
the list. Then he took his list, put it aside, and he 
went right down the roll and called everybody's

14:30.310 --> 14:37.804
name. Wow. What an impression. Wow. And from then, 
that day on, I was impressed with Dr. Eckfeldt. And

14:44.997 --> 14:50.987
besides, he used to come holler at me when I was 
playing basketball for A&M. So we became really

14:51.027 --> 14:54.433
dear friends, dear friends. And I'm glad because 
he was kind of like a model to me. about being in

14:59.249 --> 15:02.633
scholastics and stuff like that. And

15:02.673 --> 15:14.028
during that first semester, where did you study 
and what kind of routine did you establish? Well,

15:15.470 --> 15:20.957
the routine, I had to get up early and get 
everything ready. Describe a typical day. A

15:22.283 --> 15:39.182
typical day, I got up early, say at 5.30, get my room 
in shape, and then I had to go down and get Mr. Neely

15:22.283 --> 15:39.182
and Mr. Faust, get them up and ready to go to school 
and get their room ready. And then I had to leave

15:39.282 --> 15:41.544
earlier. I had to leave about quarter to 7 to go to 
the mess hall because I was waiting tables at

15:41.564 --> 15:51.295
Duncan Hall. And then after the morning 
breakfast, then I'd go back and get my books and go

15:51.612 --> 16:10.780
on to class and walk to class through the campus 
wherever I was going to the chemistry building or

15:51.612 --> 16:10.780
biology building or things like that. And I did the 
same thing at noon. I'd come back, had to check in

16:15.828 --> 16:22.357
with Reed Faust and Slim Neely and see if they 
needed anything. And then normally we're in

16:23.018 --> 16:26.924
school, and so they were seniors. They didn't 
harass me or bother me. Then I'd go in the mess hall

16:29.848 --> 16:43.067
and work the noon meal, and then had a 1 o'clock 
class, and I'd go on to class, and then at 4.35

16:29.848 --> 16:43.067
o'clock, I was told that I had to play football. 
Since I had a basketball scholarship I had to play

16:48.767 --> 16:52.011
all the sports. I said I never played football in my 
life. I was a cheerleader in high school. They said

16:58.418 --> 16:59.520
well you got to play. So I said okay. So I went out and 
made the team, first freshman team. I weighed

17:05.827 --> 17:09.612
about 165.

17:09.929 --> 17:13.694
I played with Willie Zaplack and Dub Sibley and 
that bunch. And then about halfway through the

17:13.814 --> 17:26.409
season I was run over by Marshall Robnett and John 
Kimbrough and it was just devastating to me. I

17:26.449 --> 17:29.433
couldn't get up off the ground, off the gridiron. 
And I walked off the field. And coach Norton was

17:32.018 --> 17:35.884
hollering at me, come back here, come back here. I 
couldn't hear him. But anyway, I asked them to

17:37.868 --> 17:43.377
relieve me of football. And so they did. And I 
concentrated on basketball. And then when I'd

17:49.848 --> 17:51.951
come in from practice, go to the mess hall and work 
the evening meal, eat, and come back to the mess,

17:52.724 --> 18:01.058
come back to the dormitory. And we had

18:01.720 --> 18:09.613
rehabilitation sessions, as you call them. And 
then at 7 o'clock, though, everybody was in their

18:10.094 --> 18:13.500
room studying. And I studied very late, taking a 
science course like I did. During that first

18:21.457 --> 18:24.720
semester, which were the toughest courses you had 
to cope with? Chemistry. Chemistry. Who taught

18:27.023 --> 18:28.164
that, do you remember? Dr. Potts. He was from the 
Beaumont area. I didn't know him, but Dr. Potts was

18:33.770 --> 18:42.019
my freshman chemistry prof. Now you mentioned 
working at Duncan. How much money did you bring

18:42.556 --> 18:47.204
with you when you left Beaumont to come to school? 
Dr. Monroe, I don't remember bringing any money.

18:51.773 --> 18:54.017
To be honest with you, I didn't have any money. And 
actually, the money I made in the mess hall was

18:55.299 --> 19:03.854
about $28 a month. The meal and laundry cost us $32 a 
month. So I had to hustle up $3 or $4 more to pay for

19:09.891 --> 19:17.600
the things that I was using. A&M took care of the 
tuition, took care of the scholastic end of it, but

19:18.562 --> 19:24.509
I had to do the other. So you were paying your 
entire, you were hustling for the money? to pay

19:29.198 --> 19:30.401
your entire way? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Let's see. And 
during that fall, what kind of hazing was there in

19:34.409 --> 19:43.529
your outfit? Well, it wasn't physical hazing. 
that I want to put on record.

19:55.359 --> 20:12.503
But it was typical fish, sophomore fish sessions 
where they'd scream and holler at you and make you

19:55.359 --> 20:12.503
do exercises and push-ups and

19:55.359 --> 20:12.503
catwalk down the halls and come back. Did you all 
retaliate with drown outs and tricks on the

20:13.073 --> 20:20.141
sophomores or anything? Well, they did. I didn't 
do much of that. For some reason I never got into

20:24.026 --> 20:31.455
that or they never asked me to drown out anybody, 
sophomores. Now we did have mustard, baby, where

20:31.976 --> 20:40.566
you'd crawl on your, I didn't do it because I was 
waiting tables. crawl on your hands and knees and

20:40.951 --> 20:49.930
go to somebody's boots or put baby on their boots, 
which is known as mustard. But I didn't do much

20:50.672 --> 20:53.157
drowning out. My roommate did. Babcock did. Let's 
see, and you learned all the nicknames for the

20:59.547 --> 21:06.533
food. Right. And did you all have Cush questions 
then? Or does that come later? I think I came later.

21:17.522 --> 21:19.204
We didn't know about Cush. Well, see a Cush 
question is something that happened later I

21:19.424 --> 21:23.608
think. I'm a sophomore and I ask you a fish, a Cush 
question. And if you don't get the right answer,

21:28.792 --> 21:32.101
then you don't get any cushion. I get to eat yours, 
and I ask you a question for which there is no right

21:32.141 --> 21:36.393
answer. Whatever you say, I'll declare as wrong. 
Yeah. No, we didn't have that. Did you and your

21:41.608 --> 21:43.493
buddies get nicknamed? Did you have a nickname? 
Yeah, I had a nickname. What was it? Iron Man. Iron

21:49.508 --> 21:50.049
Man. Because I played 40 minute basketball 
without relief and up and down the courts.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.498
Describe that freshman year of basketball. Well, 
it was... Who was the coach, and who were your

22:02.693 --> 22:07.400
teammates? Coach McQuillan was the varsity 
coach, and he looked after the freshmen, too.

22:14.710 --> 22:16.973
That's E.E. McQuillan, is that right? No, no. Hub 
McQuillan. Hub McQuillan. E.E. was a former

22:22.040 --> 22:23.162
student. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hub McQuillan. Spell 
McQuillan. M-C-Q-U... Same way you spell E.E.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.013
McQuillan. Okay. M, capital M, small c, 
Q-u-i-l-l-o-n, Quillon. Okay. He was the varsity

22:41.119 --> 22:42.981
basketball coach. And in

22:44.043 --> 22:56.140
the afternoons I was taking comparative anatomy, 
biology under Dr. Potter. he was a biology prof and

22:57.402 --> 23:24.456
he was our pre-med advisor and about 4 15 4 30 i would 
fold up my cat that i was working on and put it in the

22:57.402 --> 23:24.456
formaldehyde vat and he'd say mr coconuts where 
are you going you're leaving early and i said i got

22:57.402 --> 23:24.456
to go to basketball practice he says well you 
better make a decision a choice you want to play

22:57.402 --> 23:24.456
basketball or you want to go to medical school I 
said, well, if I don't play basketball, I lose my

23:25.195 --> 23:30.666
scholarship, have to drop out of school, probably 
can't afford it. And he said, well, I'm sorry about

23:30.686 --> 23:32.650
that. And he was really upset with me. But I 
continued the course and graduated in it. But I'd

23:43.927 --> 23:56.000
go play basketball and then after

23:43.927 --> 23:56.000
basketball I had to wait on the training table. And 
you waited tables in Sabisa or in Duncan? Duncan.

24:02.767 --> 24:03.587
This is my fish here. Describe basketball 
practice for freshmen. Well, we had our normal

24:09.253 --> 24:13.798
drills and then we would scrimmage against the 
varsity. And sometimes the varsity coach, Hub

24:18.022 --> 24:22.948
McQuillan, didn't like what he saw out there. The 
freshman was beating them. I had guys like Raymond

24:25.232 --> 24:37.508
Clutch and Pete Watkins and Dawson and myself, and 
we were a pretty good little group.

24:38.635 --> 24:42.660
And we practiced against the varsity and did 
pretty well against them. And that lasted about 7

24:43.661 --> 24:48.568
o'clock, 7.30. So it was always late getting home, 
getting to the dorm. And then after I got to the

24:52.633 --> 25:00.863
Duncan Hall, waited tables for the training for 
the athletes, ate my dinner and went back to the

25:01.400 --> 25:05.909
dorm, sophomores all waiting for me. Boy, I mean, 
they wouldn't let me get by with nothing. And so we

25:10.317 --> 25:19.375
had our normal sessions and then I'd have to 7 
o'clock or 7.30 I'd be studying. And how long did

25:19.979 --> 25:24.284
you and your roommate study? Well, it was after 
midnight. I had to get special permission to go

25:28.189 --> 25:31.352
beyond 11 o'clock. And, of course, Reed Fowles and 
Slim Neely always gave me permission. And I

25:37.479 --> 25:42.725
studied pretty late. Charlie, in the meantime, 
had to drop out of school. And I had a new roommate

25:49.628 --> 25:52.111
named Bobby Woodham. He was an electrical 
engineer. Now this is the second semester? Second

25:56.236 --> 25:57.138
semester. And he was from the Beaumont area and he 
went to Lamar University a couple of years and then

25:57.758 --> 26:05.428
transferred to A&M. But he had to go through the 
fish year like everybody else. And he stayed until

26:09.433 --> 26:13.358
two, three o'clock in the morning. Now, were you 
all allowed to have a radio in your room and have it

26:13.507 --> 26:17.698
on? We had the radio, but it had to be turned off at 7. 
Oh, okay. Did not play the radio. Strict study.

26:29.133 --> 26:31.337
And you're on the fourth floor. Fourth floor. And 
we'll call them stoops then. Yeah, that's right.

26:38.708 --> 26:51.429
The, as you, as that first fall semester, did you go 
on any out of town trips with, for football or

26:38.708 --> 26:51.429
anything, or basketball or anything?

26:54.935 --> 26:56.457
Did you go on the fall court trip? Yeah, we went to 
TCU, Fort Worth. It was a court trip, and 12 of us

27:01.597 --> 27:11.246
were in one room at the hotel, and we hitchhiked up 
there and hitchhiked back. Describe Aggie

27:11.427 --> 27:14.209
hitchhiking. Oh, that's a unique thing. I'll 
describe going from A&M to Beaumont. How's that?

27:19.394 --> 27:19.855
That's good. I'd get out on the highway in front of 
the university here, and there's always a line.

27:25.867 --> 27:29.873
you had to lay your bag behind the last bag that was 
in line. You lay your bag down and you go get in line

27:29.893 --> 27:33.137
and sit down. And the number one, two men were up 
there thumbing the ride. When they got picked up,

27:37.443 --> 27:41.368
then you move up, move up, moved up. And that went 
through Houston, too. And I didn't have any

27:44.733 --> 27:52.043
problems with the student hitchhiking, going to 
from Houston to Beaumont because there weren't

27:52.748 --> 27:55.251
many of us. But coming back I would, we went to 
Washington Street and oh I can't remember the

27:55.692 --> 28:07.548
name, I think it was Shepherd, Washington and 
Shepherd. There was a Weingarten supermarket

28:07.828 --> 28:12.394
there and we'd lay our bags up there. But then we had 
others who upstreamed us. The word upstream is

28:15.890 --> 28:19.878
somebody gets ahead of the group and gets up there. 
Well, we didn't like that, and we would en masse go

28:19.918 --> 28:24.647
up there and tell them, look, you're an Aggie? You 
do like the rest of us Aggies. Get in line. Now,

28:27.572 --> 28:30.017
where in Beaumont was the best place to get a ride? 
Fourth and College. That was the outskirts of the

28:31.747 --> 28:34.331
city. And you know, that's a unique thing with my 
mama. Papa had this bread truck and he would always

28:38.697 --> 28:49.873
take me to the Fourth and College and drop me off and 
I'd wave, you know, after hugging them and kissing

28:38.697 --> 28:49.873
them goodbye, and I'd wave bye. They wouldn't 
leave. They wouldn't leave. They wouldn't leave

28:52.436 --> 28:56.642
that area until I was gone. Because mama did not 
want to leave me by myself out there. About how long

29:03.086 --> 29:09.576
normally did it take to get a ride from between 
College Station and Beaumont? How long did it take

29:09.957 --> 29:11.018
you to? Well, it was longer between Houston and 
Beaumont than it was from Beaumont from College

29:11.118 --> 29:16.947
Station to Houston. But the full trip, could you do 
it in six hours? Unless about five, five or six

29:20.973 --> 29:23.357
hours. Describe some of the memories you have of 
Aggie hitchhiking, some of the I had a very unique

29:29.527 --> 29:33.572
occasion. I was coming from Main M to Beaumont and 
this nice looking car stopped. Now this was in the

29:41.683 --> 29:49.473
42 and the gentleman was in there and he said, where 
are you going son? I said I'm going to Beaumont. He

29:50.875 --> 29:52.497
said well get in, I'm going to Houston. I said, 
fine, sir. So, of course, we were told to introduce

29:55.079 --> 29:58.483
ourselves. I introduced myself. He said, my name 
is Abercrombie. I said, nice to know you, Mr.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.231
Abercrombie. And so we talked and visited and 
talked and talked. And we get to Houston. He said,

30:12.120 --> 30:12.860
you know what? I got nothing to do. I'll take you to 
Beaumont. So he took me to Beaumont. Mr.

30:18.304 --> 30:23.717
Abercrombie owned Abercrombie Oil Company in 
Houston. A very fine person. And he told me, when he

30:25.601 --> 30:30.313
dropped me off in front of my home in Beaumont, he 
says, if you ever need a job, come see me." I said, I

30:34.623 --> 30:36.365
sure will, Mr. Abercrombie. And of course the war 
came and that disrupted a lot of things. But I think

30:40.572 --> 30:46.020
that was one of the finest experiences I ever had of 
hitchhiking. And I've had other Occasions with

30:48.923 --> 30:55.330
people, but he impressed me so much, he and his 
family. Did you ever have any bad experience

30:55.350 --> 30:58.754
hitchhiking? No, not really that I can think of. So 
far, no Aggie has passed on any bad ones. There have

31:09.406 --> 31:17.395
been two or three that said, yes, the guy was 
drinking a little too much, he was driving too

31:09.406 --> 31:17.395
fast, nothing more than that. I didn't even have 
any women occurrences at all. Nobody has

31:23.972 --> 31:26.739
mentioned anything like that? Really? That's 
really good.
