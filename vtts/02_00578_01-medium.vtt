00:12.383 --> 00:16.309
My name is Stephanie Middleton, and I am a student 
at Texas A&M University. And today, November 19,

00:16.790 --> 00:25.664
1983, I am interviewing Mr. David Pomeroy, Jr., a 
fourth-generation descendant of a Pasadena

00:16.790 --> 00:25.664
founder. He is legal consultant for Pomeroy 
Drilling and the former president of the Pasadena

00:26.806 --> 00:32.916
Historical Society. The Pomeroy family has had a 
tremendous impact on the growth and progress of

00:33.938 --> 00:39.707
Pasadena. Mr. Pomeroy, let me start off by asking 
you a little background history. When did the

00:45.863 --> 00:53.450
Pomeroy family first move to Pasadena and why did 
they decide to settle in Pasadena? Pomeroy's came

00:53.470 --> 00:58.675
to Pasadena shortly after the beginning of 1901. 
They had been living in Galveston in 1900 and were

01:10.282 --> 01:18.250
caught in the great Galveston storm in September 
1900 where over 7,000 people were killed in

01:10.282 --> 01:18.250
Galveston alone. When they woke up the next day 
after the storm, the hurricane had hit, they

01:18.270 --> 01:25.557
looked and they could see where they had gone from 
Mexico. The day before, there had been about 12

01:25.577 --> 01:31.983
blocks of houses between them and the bay. So they 
decided they were a little too close to the water

01:32.003 --> 01:37.088
and started to move back inland. Now, they had 
lived in Brenham. and had started the dairy there

01:38.902 --> 01:42.747
in the early 1890s. So they decided, well, let's go 
back to Brennan. That's a nice community we know

01:44.749 --> 01:47.292
and we're aware of. They had stopped in Hitchcock 
because in-laws had been killed during the war,

01:47.312 --> 01:54.621
during the hurricane. And they needed to tidy up 
the business there and to send the survivors up

01:54.641 --> 02:01.690
north to be with other relatives. And after they'd 
tidied up there, then my great-grandfather,

02:01.710 --> 02:08.318
Edward Payson, probably put my 
great-grandmother on the train along with the

02:08.787 --> 02:13.127
cattle that survived in the old dairy and sent them 
on to Brennan like Payson and his son, John Pomboy,

02:13.816 --> 02:19.882
got in a wagon and started heading towards 
Brennan. They stopped in the Pasadena area to help

02:19.902 --> 02:30.972
a farmer mend some fences and to hand-dig a 
waterway, which Payson had become so proficient

02:19.902 --> 02:30.972
at in the last 10 years and had some sort of 
reputation. They decided, this is far enough

02:31.573 --> 02:42.743
inland, the grass is green enough, I think we're 
going to settle here, so he set off a telegram and

02:31.573 --> 02:42.743
had Anna return with the cows and be settled in 
Pasadena. the place that we're now talking from,

02:43.280 --> 02:47.747
and we purchased in April of 1901. It was the first 
piece of property, and this is my office. We're

02:51.452 --> 02:54.076
still here. When your family first settled in 
Pasadena, what was the town like, and did your

02:54.096 --> 03:01.087
family have a major role in the community? Well, in 
1901, there was a debate as to how many people were

03:02.469 --> 03:08.258
in Pasadena. Part of the debate is, what was 
Pasadena? If you look at Pasadena today, it

03:11.528 --> 03:22.348
includes what previously was five different 
communities, all half a day's journey from each

03:11.528 --> 03:22.348
other almost by wagon. In the area that we are right 
now, the old section of downtown Pasadena, there

03:23.476 --> 03:32.030
was either six or 16 families. I suspect there was 
something like, my grandfather took something

03:32.951 --> 03:37.178
over here, the sixth family in Pasadena. I think he 
could probably see five other houses. So from

03:40.143 --> 03:42.767
here, there were five other houses within view. A 
little bit to the west of us, there were probably

03:43.669 --> 03:49.939
five or six houses over there. East of us, there's a 
couple more houses that way. All told, 16 was the

03:53.605 --> 04:02.954
largest number of people that claimed to have been 
in the general area in 1901. By 1901, the area was

04:02.974 --> 04:06.737
all perfect. All the trees you see today were 
planted by the people that came here. The streets

04:10.861 --> 04:18.508
were, I would say, the original plat, which 
encompasses now maybe 15, 20% of what the

04:19.197 --> 04:26.528
community is in size, you would have only a handful 
of streets. Main Street was laid out. It was a

04:28.571 --> 04:31.876
graded dirt street. The Port Road, which is now 
Texas Highway 225, was a dirt road. We had a

04:39.127 --> 04:43.694
railroad track through town and Shaver and Pitts. 
And that's about all the streets at one time at a

04:43.714 --> 04:46.078
time. We have one more, which is Shaw. then called 
Fit Street.

04:53.642 --> 04:56.745
The orientation of the community was around the 
railroad track. The area didn't open up until the

04:56.765 --> 05:04.835
railroads came in through the area.

05:04.855 --> 05:13.825
Let me say, as far as the Home Roy's role in the 
community, in the early days in particular, There

05:14.817 --> 05:20.723
were several of the earlier families that played a 
significant role and carried the community. In

05:21.064 --> 05:25.288
those days, you couldn't hire someone else to do 
it. There wasn't someone else to do the job. You had

05:27.911 --> 05:29.533
to do the job yourself. They got very strong about 
schools. So everyone initially took turns being

05:31.435 --> 05:38.943
either on the school board or carrying out the 
functions of the school board. And as far as

05:38.963 --> 05:42.046
churches, you just didn't passively attend 
churches. There were no churches. You either

05:43.471 --> 05:52.301
started a church, or you sped off from a church, or 
you were heathen and you didn't want to be a

05:43.471 --> 05:52.301
heathen. But there were some major families, and I 
like to consider them sort of family groupings.

05:58.108 --> 06:04.735
The Pomeroy's were related by marriage to the 
McMasters and the Williams. Now, the Williams

06:05.056 --> 06:07.338
came earlier. They came in 1893 or 94, just forms. 
Pomerose came in 1901, and McMaster's came in

06:12.445 --> 06:16.553
1912. But McMaster girls married Williams and 
farmers of Pomerose. So we participated in many

06:20.340 --> 06:23.547
things together. The same thing happened for the 
Parks family. The Parks family came in 1901, later

06:25.971 --> 06:31.302
in the year, or 1902, pardon me. And they married 
with the the Blakesways and the Atkinsons and the

06:33.404 --> 06:40.174
Fortwoods and the Jacksons, and they sort of as a 
group formed another nucleus. Now, I might point

06:40.254 --> 06:52.451
out, I'm sure I'll mention it more often, the 
community in the early days after the churches

06:40.254 --> 06:52.451
were initially founded was broken into, again, 
two groups. There was the Baptist and there was the

06:53.052 --> 06:55.916
Methodist. The Pomeranians were the Baptist and 
the Parks were the Methodist. It just sort of

06:59.641 --> 07:01.183
worked out that way. You had a couple of others. You 
had the Oscar Cruz group, which is Swedish

07:02.923 --> 07:12.094
immigrants that settled out off of Ritchie 
Street, and they had a settlement out there. They

07:12.234 --> 07:18.982
were very influential in the school districts, so 
they had a huge contribution there. And there was

07:19.002 --> 07:21.325
Mr. A.R. Cruz and his family. He was a businessman. 
He had the first bus company in town, the first

07:24.228 --> 07:30.175
insurance company in town, the first plumbing 
company in town, the first drive-in in town. And it

07:30.475 --> 07:31.517
was all the same goal. It's just different 
services, whatever you needed. That's the way

07:33.980 --> 07:34.762
they were. Everybody just, whatever you needed, 
someone came up with it.

07:41.692 --> 07:52.108
The Pomeroy's, like most of the earlier basic 
families in the community, or the two or three

07:41.692 --> 07:52.108
major families, got involved. When they came to 
town, there was no church. And there was a halo to

07:54.272 --> 07:55.774
call about it. a denominational group that was 
meeting in an adjoining city. An adjoining city is

08:00.587 --> 08:05.634
Deepwater, which is now part of Pasadena, but it's 
about three miles from here. So that was a Sunday

08:05.654 --> 08:09.719
morning, got up early to get on some gondola in 
Deepwater and came back. So they moved the church

08:11.361 --> 08:16.327
to Pasadena, or at least they moved it to Pasadena. 
And my great-grandfather, Payson Pomeroy, and

08:16.347 --> 08:22.875
his wife, Anna, were original charter members. 
First Baptist Church. There were 17 charter

08:24.890 --> 08:27.633
members. The Williams were also charter members. 
The McMaster's weren't here yet since this is

08:29.776 --> 08:31.879
1901.

08:36.104 --> 08:43.392
School board, my great-grandfather was an early 
school board member, served for several years

08:36.104 --> 08:43.392
until his death in 1906.

08:45.735 --> 08:46.416
After that, My grandfather was like 17 at the time, 
and when he got into his mid-20s, then he too got on

08:46.852 --> 08:55.442
the school board and served, I believe, some 17 
years. So they got involved in what needed to be

08:56.643 --> 08:58.945
done. The city needed water service. This is on in 
the 30s, 20s, partly. And the Palmers were water

09:06.234 --> 09:16.605
well drillers, so they went and drilled a city 
water well and ran pipes to all the houses that

09:06.234 --> 09:16.605
needed and had the franchise to serve water before 
the town became incorporated. They sold it to the

09:17.024 --> 09:19.126
city. That's the beginnings of the water 
department we have now. So we were involved in most

09:23.652 --> 09:26.034
everything that was going on.

09:29.538 --> 09:34.604
Your grandfather, John Edward Pomeroy, Sr., had a 
great impact on Pasadena's progress. What were

09:35.085 --> 09:39.570
some of his contributions?

09:39.590 --> 09:44.736
Well, John, when he came to Pasadena, was 12 years 
old.

09:46.876 --> 09:53.986
When his father died in 1906, he had to assume 
responsibility for the family. At the time, we had

09:54.006 --> 10:09.347
a dairy and some farming, as most everybody else 
here had a little strawberry patch out back, or

09:54.006 --> 10:09.347
figs, or cantaloupes, or satsuma oranges, a whole 
host of crops. And they were, everybody was

10:09.368 --> 10:14.014
farming 10 to, to 20 acres is the size of the farms. 
And John was involved with that.

10:23.868 --> 10:38.005
As he grew a little bit older and solved his basic 
problem of earning a living for his mother and

10:23.868 --> 10:38.005
himself, then he began to get involved in the 
community. He married a schoolteacher. And so he

10:40.448 --> 10:43.832
became very interested in the school system. 
Grandmother used to always have a room available

10:44.842 --> 10:48.908
for school teaching. They would hire a teacher and 
they would only hire him for a session at a time.

10:52.433 --> 11:00.364
They invariably would either room with the 
Pomeroy's or the Parks or maybe the Cruzes,

10:52.433 --> 11:00.364
whoever had an extra room, but we always had a room. 
In fact, I sort of laughed because as my

11:01.065 --> 11:11.621
grandfather had children, they ran out of rooms to 
rent, so my great-grandmother built a house next

11:01.065 --> 11:11.621
door so she could continue to rent rooms out. And 
that's where my uncle met his wife. and several

11:13.867 --> 11:17.051
other people in the community met their wives. So 
he got involved. He was on the school board. He was a

11:18.733 --> 11:23.099
member of the school board when they decided to 
establish a high school. He was on the school board

11:23.720 --> 11:27.085
when they decided to establish a junior high 
school. And there were some times in there he said

11:27.105 --> 11:35.496
that everybody was mad at him because he wanted to 
buy a lot of land so that the school would have room

11:27.105 --> 11:35.496
to expand on. And that policy has seemed to 
continue with the school district because if

11:35.516 --> 11:40.262
you'll notice anywhere the school has bought land 
for its site. It's not just a site big enough for a

11:42.475 --> 11:44.920
school. It's a site big enough for expansion or 
maybe a couple of schools. And probably the best

11:49.788 --> 11:54.938
real estate developer in town is the school 
district. My grandfather was also involved very

11:54.958 --> 12:04.815
much in community,

11:54.958 --> 12:04.815
well, in his business, homeowner drilling. At 
that time, it was McMaster and Palmer, a water

12:05.521 --> 12:08.508
watch company. He had gone in business with his 
brother-in-law, Clyde McMaster. It seems that my

12:13.860 --> 12:19.634
grandfather, because of his father, knew a little 
bit about digging water bottles. Basically, it

12:19.654 --> 12:22.821
was originally, it was he and Doug, and then he got 
to thinking, They were grinding the sugar cane,

12:23.071 --> 12:33.889
which he had a sugar cane field, and they'd take, 
the grinder would be in the middle, they'd have a

12:23.071 --> 12:33.889
pole go out, they'd have a horse, and the horse 
would walk around and around and around. He got to

12:33.909 --> 12:45.990
thinking, well, if I stick a

12:33.909 --> 12:45.990
shovel type device or something in the middle and 
let the pole go around and around and around, I can

12:33.909 --> 12:45.990
dig a hole. So he started doing that. I met my 
grandmother. They got married and got to talking

12:51.068 --> 12:53.352
to his brother-in-law. And his brother-in-law 
said, well, I got an engine. Why don't you use my

12:55.235 --> 12:58.119
engine and your little turning device there? And 
they started a water bottle business. And my

13:00.823 --> 13:15.184
grandfather was also, with respect to the farming 
business, Pasadena, in the mid-'20s, decided

13:00.823 --> 13:15.184
that when they harvested the crop, put it on the 
railroad cars and shipped them out of town. They

13:18.134 --> 13:22.838
had to go into Houston and deposit the bill of 
ladings with the banks there in order to get paid.

13:23.019 --> 13:27.223
And he and some of the other businessmen in the town 
said, well, gee, we ought to do that here in

13:23.019 --> 13:27.223
Pasadena. Why should we have to go to Houston? 
Well, the same idea occurred to some Houston

13:29.365 --> 13:31.147
people. They said, well, let's open up a branch in 
Pasadena. So on the same day in 1919, two banks

13:33.469 --> 13:36.993
opened. One owned by a group of Houston people, and 
one owned and parked by my grandfather. Two years

13:42.378 --> 13:44.260
later, the Pasadena bank took over the Houston 
Bank, and that's still the largest bank in town,

13:44.459 --> 13:49.985
first passing the state bank. My grandfather 
served on the board of directors of that bank for

13:50.786 --> 13:58.234
some, I have to check, but I think about 34 years. 
And now my father has taken its place. My uncle

14:00.556 --> 14:06.022
also, my master also served on the board of 
directors of that bank for many, many years.

14:11.949 --> 14:13.150
My grandfathers also involved in the civic 
affairs in the community. He was an early member of

14:17.726 --> 14:21.271
the Pasadena Rotary Club. It's a business service 
club in the community. It is still the prima donna

14:24.455 --> 14:27.760
club. It's where all the business can be once a 
week. He was an active member of that, held several

14:32.386 --> 14:37.834
offices in it. And one of the big things with him is 
he had a perfect attendance record. And he had a

14:41.860 --> 14:44.183
perfect attendance record. My father's now in it. 
He's been in it 16 years, and he's got perfect

14:45.676 --> 14:53.669
attendance, and I've been in it two years now, and 
I've got perfect attendance. Let's see, there was

14:53.689 --> 14:56.894
one other area that I was going to mention. Oh, the 
churches. My grandfather was involved in the

14:59.658 --> 15:03.825
churches.

15:07.822 --> 15:23.223
As I mentioned earlier, my great-grandfather 
helped found First Baptist Church and my

15:07.822 --> 15:23.223
grandfather was raised in that church and felt 
very strong about it and continued to serve in many

15:07.822 --> 15:23.223
leadership as well as teaching positions in the 
church.

15:26.167 --> 15:33.897
The other area of involvement with my grandfather 
would naturally be the business that he had in the

15:26.167 --> 15:33.897
community. and I feel that it had an impact upon the 
community and helping it in its growth. What

15:41.001 --> 15:43.926
impact did the Pomeroy business have on the 
community? Now you're going to nail me to the wall

15:45.068 --> 15:47.211
here, okay? Pomeroy started out first with the 
dairy business and then the farming business. And

15:56.607 --> 16:00.691
back in those days, everybody would trade off and 
help each other. In fact, I have my grandfather's

16:00.751 --> 16:03.854
book where he's listed today. I worked three hours 
for Parks, and then a little later, ODC Parks came

16:03.954 --> 16:09.399
and worked three hours for us. So he employed as 
well as helped other people. As he got into the

16:13.783 --> 16:23.813
water well business, first, they naturally were 
drilling wells in the area for the farmers so that

16:13.783 --> 16:23.813
they would not have to bring their wagons with the 
barrels on it down to up Main Street here to right

16:24.603 --> 16:36.022
across the street where the artesian well was 
until they got to take it back and try to put it on

16:24.603 --> 16:36.022
their berries and whatever. But he drilled water 
in their field. So he helped them not only improve

16:37.745 --> 16:48.963
their agricultural, but also to expand so that the 
community began to grow because water was

16:37.745 --> 16:48.963
available at different places. We had a major 
strawberry growing company from Houston that

16:52.261 --> 16:54.844
came to pass in. It had something like 58 acres of 
berries under cultivation, and Tom Moore drilled

16:54.945 --> 17:01.554
the well for them. As the ship channel industries 
came in here, they required water. And Tom Moore's

17:06.520 --> 17:13.329
had drilled water wells for, man, I guess I have to 
say, everyone. I can't think of one. Michelle

17:15.012 --> 17:16.814
came. They drilled three of them for the first year 
because they knew they needed that amount of

17:16.854 --> 17:21.981
water. The Pomeroy's provided that critical 
element of water. Because if you look

17:25.560 --> 17:30.365
historically at how towns are developed, it's 
always a long walk. Towns always need water. So the

17:32.106 --> 17:36.871
Pomeroy's, if the river wasn't there, then the 
Pomeroy's would provide the water for them. They

17:36.891 --> 17:40.955
eventually wound up providing water for most of 
Houston. And like they got with the railroads, the

17:41.656 --> 17:47.681
railroads would put the drilling rig on the flat 
car. They'd go down 50 miles, and they'd unload.

17:50.364 --> 17:51.445
The Pomeroy's drilled a well. back of the 
railroad, go down 50 miles, and drop it off.

17:54.669 --> 17:57.172
Because these were steam locomotives and they 
needed water. So they provided water every 50

17:57.673 --> 18:02.340
miles for the locomotives to stop and replace 
themselves. I know the last count that we had was

18:03.601 --> 18:07.887
something over 2,000 water wells. We drilled 
water wells specifically for the concrete

18:07.907 --> 18:14.396
companies that built the Astrodome. That was our 
last major contribution. But Rice Hotel, Warwick

18:17.020 --> 18:20.925
Hotel, Travis, Travis, hotel, all those old 
hotels. We drilled them apart. Dad's fond of

18:24.920 --> 18:40.143
saying that when John Glenn went up and came back 
and his capsule was on display, went up into space,

18:24.920 --> 18:40.143
and his capsule was on display in Houston, they 
were on one corner and Pomeroy was down on the other

18:24.920 --> 18:40.143
corner reworking a water well through a manhole. 
The water well was in the basement, so they parked

18:40.163 --> 18:44.028
on the street and took the manhole and they were 
reworking it. And he'd say, the line would start at

18:44.048 --> 18:48.896
the capsule, and he would come by the water well rig 
and say, what are you doing? What are you doing? We

18:51.922 --> 18:53.164
provided a lot of water. Also, well, I mentioned 
the early water well system. The Pasadena needed a

18:58.090 --> 18:59.632
water well system. The Conway was built a water 
well system. We were the first ones in the Pasadena

19:01.775 --> 19:07.642
to have a bath tank, and we still have that bath 
tank. I was talking to an early settler once, and he

19:07.662 --> 19:13.470
said, yes, if you wanted to tie onto the Conway 
water system, they didn't have a lot of valves. So

19:14.111 --> 19:18.216
what you did, you took your hacksaw, and you got 
your pipe, and you went out there and started

19:14.111 --> 19:18.216
sawing. The line was under pressure, so water 
started going everywhere, and you'd keep sawing,

19:18.517 --> 19:26.085
and you'd pull the pipe, and you'd do your joints, 
and you'd stick them back together. I hope you

19:26.525 --> 19:29.368
didn't drown in the process. But they also hired 
many, many people on those jobs. During the

19:34.894 --> 19:39.759
summer, they'd have as many as 30 or 40 people 
employed. And invariably, it would be

19:40.179 --> 19:48.388
schoolteachers, because the bombers were very 
close to the school, like the coaches and the

19:40.179 --> 19:48.388
woodshop teachers. And any male teacher, they 
didn't, they didn't hire females. Nothing

19:51.746 --> 19:57.794
prejudiced, it's just women didn't want to get 
that dirty or work that hard. And there's one of the

19:57.814 --> 20:01.939
stories of Carol Teague, who's down on the State 
Board of Education. He was a woodshop teacher, and

20:01.959 --> 20:07.886
his wife was expecting a child, and he was the only 
short on funds. My grandfather found out about it,

20:07.947 --> 20:12.512
and he says, well, Carol, you know, we've got these 
jobs, why don't you come and work for us? So Carol

20:13.393 --> 20:15.456
worked, I believe it was, 72 hours straight or 
something. I forget exactly how the story goes.

20:20.114 --> 20:26.219
But anyway, he made enough money, finished the 
job, went back home, his wife had the baby, and he

20:20.114 --> 20:26.219
could pay cash for it. So there's a lot of little 
stories like that with the Palmeiras. You talk to

20:28.642 --> 20:32.065
any old Tigers and they say, well, yeah, I used to 
work for the Palmeiras one summer. It was amazing.

20:32.625 --> 20:38.911
They probably hired a couple thousand people in 
the course of their history.

20:38.931 --> 20:42.234
What was your grandfather's influence on the 
people in Pasadena? Well, we covered some of that

20:43.815 --> 20:45.477
above. I would say probably the thing most people 
remember him about was he was a peacemaker. I had

20:55.825 --> 21:00.411
never really realized this until I went to his 
funeral. And the preacher was out there talking

21:00.431 --> 21:03.155
about Brother John. Everybody called him Brother 
John. And he said when Brother John saw things were

21:07.140 --> 21:14.430
getting a little out of hand, he'd always put his 
hand up and sort of wave it and say, just take it

21:07.140 --> 21:14.430
easy. And I remember that. I never really thought 
about it. And there were times when, like, the

21:17.384 --> 21:22.830
school wanted to, pardon me, the church wanted to 
expand. They wanted to buy the land behind it. And

21:25.493 --> 21:28.056
the people behind them just wouldn't sell. They'd 
always send for the job. And he just had a way of

21:30.238 --> 21:32.260
talking to people. People had confidence in him. 
And they'd work out some sort of compromise. When

21:37.566 --> 21:42.391
the bank wanted to expand space and buy a new site, 
they couldn't work out a deal. After about a year,

21:42.651 --> 21:44.874
they'd send for the job. And he'd go work it out. He 
was always long on advice. He was a slow,

21:50.078 --> 21:54.844
deliberate, kind person. He was extremely 
religious. He was a living example of what he

21:58.189 --> 22:01.773
talked about. So often you get upset about people 
in religion that make all these things about being

22:01.793 --> 22:09.744
religious, and they go out and catch them doing 
things that you say, well, you know, he's not

22:01.793 --> 22:09.744
living. My grandfather lived an example. He was 
involved with the church, as I had mentioned

22:14.742 --> 22:25.674
earlier, with his father that he served, first 
Baptist church, okay? Got to one point where there

22:25.694 --> 22:27.897
was a rift in the church. And he said, well, you 
know, I'm still going to church, and I don't like

22:28.838 --> 22:31.962
this church. So a group of them went across the 
street and started another church. It was

22:35.205 --> 22:38.769
Memorial Baptist Church, and it's still here. 
After several years, the old group started making

22:38.789 --> 22:43.855
up. So they came back in to First Baptist Church and 
they taught the preacher with them. This is about

22:49.214 --> 22:50.816
1940. A preacher, John Morgan. He was there, I 
think, until 1965. Okay, about 58 or so, they got,

22:55.482 --> 23:07.057
the church decided that the town had moved beyond 
them, so they wanted to move out. And they asked

23:07.077 --> 23:08.660
Brother John what he thought. He said, I think 
that's an excellent suggestion, but I'm used to

23:08.680 --> 23:12.745
walking one block just to the First Baptist 
Church. So if you all move on out there, we'll start

23:14.073 --> 23:17.036
a new Baptist Church. So South Main Baptist Church 
was started. So he had, again, three churches in

23:19.559 --> 23:22.282
the community. He served in leadership and all of 
those. He was a school teacher for the men's class

23:25.746 --> 23:30.031
probably 20 years. Same thing for my grandmother. 
She was very much involved. She taught many, many

23:34.316 --> 23:37.399
years in that church.

23:43.606 --> 23:50.536
The, another, besides being the peacemaker, also 
many people came to my grandfather for financial

23:43.606 --> 23:50.536
advice. He was a very hard worker. He had a 
reputation of trying to be fair on any deal.

24:02.213 --> 24:08.502
And when people had monetary questions, they 
would come and ask him, and he would give him, I know

24:02.213 --> 24:08.502
Grant Sexton, the photographer at the time. I 
think he tells me the story every time I see him.

24:10.745 --> 24:12.347
Your grandfather told you that? You just own this 
man right here, and we'll be security forever.

24:21.023 --> 24:24.026
So.

24:24.046 --> 24:28.390
How have the lifestyles of people in Pasadena 
changed since the day of your grandfather?

24:29.932 --> 24:31.913
Tremendous. My grandfather came here in 1901. He 
came in a wagon. I have in one of his diaries, in the

24:37.398 --> 24:41.322
intro, about 1902, where he's out on the farm 
there, and he sees a car come down, 225, in the port

24:42.415 --> 24:49.101
road. And he noted the second car he'd ever seen in 
his life. By the time of his death, 1981, we were

24:54.485 --> 24:59.910
walking in the noon. So technologically, he saw a 
tremendous amount of change. From a community

25:02.932 --> 25:08.697
standpoint, when he came, there was no religious 
community. There is a tremendous religious

25:08.717 --> 25:12.000
community in the town now. There was an 
unincorporated school with a one room, about 12

25:12.537 --> 25:22.290
students. And this is not only just Pasadena, it 
was the greater Pasadena area. They were pulling

25:26.575 --> 25:36.568
them in from Deepwater and from South Houston and 
on over towards where Arco is now. So they came from

25:36.589 --> 25:38.511
everywhere. He saw the religion and the education 
of the community change. It was a high priority, as

25:43.803 --> 25:46.306
the churches were. So he had his guiding hand in the 
development of the school district. And I think

25:54.336 --> 26:02.365
it's shown that the community is still very strong 
in education.

26:02.946 --> 26:06.810
The social lifestyle of the community at that time 
was very much tied around the churches. And it was

26:07.499 --> 26:12.165
you went to church Sunday morning, and then Sunday 
afternoon, you had a church event. And that's

26:12.185 --> 26:18.312
where everybody got together, the Baptists and 
the Methodists. And they would have sometimes

26:18.332 --> 26:22.758
competitions against each other. There would be 
sack races and horseshoe pitching and all of those

26:22.798 --> 26:26.943
types of things. But it was a very slow life. I 
recall from him. He got up. His diaries reflect

26:31.128 --> 26:36.915
that he would get up in the morning, and he would 
hoe, and then he would go work for someone else, and

26:37.452 --> 26:42.798
then the preacher would come over and forget where 
he'd ever been. It was very, almost a humble

26:42.818 --> 26:53.829
existence, because on his birthday, his entry, 
after a whole day worth of activities, he said, and

26:42.818 --> 26:53.829
it was my birthday. And that was the end of it. There 
was no big, great celebrations.

26:59.655 --> 27:01.918
There was no industry. The workers that worked in 
agriculture If you owned the property, you

27:05.279 --> 27:09.744
exchanged with each other your time. If you were a 
worker, a picker, for instance, or a cultivator

27:09.764 --> 27:15.791
that came in, you got paid at the end of the season. 
When the thing was harvested, it turned into

27:15.812 --> 27:18.975
money, then you got paid. Along the way, you would 
receive some tokens. Tokens were redeemable in

27:23.701 --> 27:27.405
local stores, so you could get your groceries. Or 
the local merchants would just carry you. And they

27:31.030 --> 27:33.092
knew you worked for John, The park's over here, so 
they just wrote your name down in the ledger book.

27:36.125 --> 27:39.069
And when you got through, you came in and you paid 
your bill. One of the saddest things to me is when I

27:39.830 --> 27:50.542
returned from college in the 60s and found the 
front door of my family's house locked. Because

27:51.203 --> 27:55.428
when I left in 59, nobody locked the door so fast. 
There was no problem. It was a very honorable

27:57.651 --> 28:00.014
community. Everybody knew everybody. There 
might be one or two rotten people in town, but they

28:02.300 --> 28:07.329
knew not to bother anybody. They'd go out, they'd 
get drunk, and they'd go raise a little hell. But

28:10.414 --> 28:11.396
that was it.

28:15.704 --> 28:20.292
Industry came in, starting in 1917, 1918. late 30s 
is when it really started growing. And the town

28:23.594 --> 28:30.143
started as six families, which grew very slowly up 
until the 30s. There was like 2,500 people in

28:30.163 --> 28:39.677
Pasadena in the mid-30s, and just over and out, and 
just mushroomed. You had people coming in that

28:39.697 --> 28:44.524
just needed rooms, and so they started building 
more. At that point, you stayed with someone until

28:44.774 --> 28:49.500
the house became available. Or maybe after about 
four or five years, you could afford to build your

28:50.000 --> 28:53.364
own. Invariably, it was a two-room type 
structure. Kitchen, living room combination

28:55.767 --> 29:00.473
with the bedroom. And if you had your own, they 
slept in the bedroom. And after a couple years, you

29:02.415 --> 29:05.659
saved up some money and you built another room. The 
Parks House is notorious for that. They started

29:08.542 --> 29:14.089
out as a two-room house, and they had a successful 
strawberry crop, and they built a kitchen off

29:08.542 --> 29:14.089
that. another one they built two bedrooms 
upstairs and another one they built the dining

29:14.272 --> 29:40.937
room and the house is a whole progression of 
additions there were very few there wasn't a

29:14.272 --> 29:40.937
wealthy class in the community everybody had 
about the same amount of money nobody flashed it

29:14.272 --> 29:40.937
around

29:14.272 --> 29:40.937
everybody pitched in and the community has just 
grown and changed and has become I went through a

29:41.390 --> 29:46.718
period there in the 50s and 60s of being your 
typical bedroom community.

29:49.582 --> 29:55.791
One of the, I think, prime community. In 1929, I 
passed into the corporation for the final time.

30:00.098 --> 30:03.603
And they hired two policemen, two motorcycle 
policemen. They passed me and got a reputation as

30:03.623 --> 30:05.966
being a speed track. Well, I'm sure in 1929, there 
wasn't even a handful of vehicles. But during

30:10.178 --> 30:14.687
World War II, we had one motorcycle cop, and that 
was his job, just buying tickets. It's like when

30:15.369 --> 30:19.758
you went through passing, you expected to get a 
ticket, because you were going to get a ticket. And

30:19.778 --> 30:31.562
I used to, I'm sure other people felt the same way, 
in the 50s, saying, well, the police department's

30:19.778 --> 30:31.562
really great on traffic, but if there is a crime or 
something, they wouldn't know what to do with it.

30:31.947 --> 30:35.190
Nowadays, we have a regional crime lab in 
Pasadena. We have a very sophisticated police

30:36.091 --> 30:38.773
force. We still have very strong traffic control. 
You still get a ticket in Pasadena.

30:47.602 --> 30:49.404
Yeah, let's see, lifestyles. What other areas of 
lifestyles?

30:53.227 --> 30:57.111
Religion, we've moved beyond Baptist and 
Methodist. Somehow, Catholics slept in the

30:57.131 --> 30:59.473
community. and then the Church of Christ, and the 
Lutheran, and the Episcopals. We even have a

31:04.156 --> 31:07.981
Korean missionary church in town. So other 
religions found their way in Pasadena.

31:16.853 --> 31:19.356
Let's see, cultural activities. Well, we 
progressed beyond the picnics, but we still have a

31:19.377 --> 31:27.287
ways to go. That's another whole story someday 
I'll tell you. How has your family influenced

31:30.318 --> 31:35.103
Pasadena's educational system? Ah, education. 
Well, besides being on the school board, both my

31:37.705 --> 31:54.522
great-grandfather and my grandfather, which 
were the early formative days, and they set the

31:37.705 --> 31:54.522
tenor of where we are today, I feel, the Pomeroy's 
mirrored into a bunch of school teachers. So we

31:55.323 --> 32:00.308
were, I think we got some influence in that 
direction. Clyde McMaster lost two of his wives to

32:00.828 --> 32:06.396
death. And when he married Clayton McMaster, the 
wife that survived him, she was a schoolteacher.

32:12.986 --> 32:18.094
And I forgot to mention, Clyde was also on the 
school board. Let's

32:18.114 --> 32:21.679
see. Clyde McMaster was on the school board. John 
Pomeroy was on the school board. 16 years. Payson

32:28.315 --> 32:33.383
Pomeroy was on the school board and Ben Williams 
was on the school board. Lois Williams became Lois

32:33.403 --> 32:37.329
Pomeroy. Fleeta Matthews became Fleeta 
McMasters. Irma McMasters became Irma Williams.

32:47.943 --> 32:51.087
And I'm sure we have another school teacher, too, 
in there. Lois Pomoy was in charge of teacher

32:51.508 --> 33:01.961
training in the elementary levels for about 10, 15 
years. And she was responsible for, I don't know if

33:02.702 --> 33:15.739
it was a school program or her own program, but each 
year she would have her grandfather come in to the

33:02.702 --> 33:15.739
assembled elementary school and give them a 
lecture on Pasadena's history.

33:22.081 --> 33:32.704
Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that one of the 
elementary schools in town is Pomeroy Elementary

33:22.081 --> 33:32.704
School, named for my great-grandfather's 
grandfather. It's always an amazement to me to

33:33.226 --> 33:38.237
have someone say, oh, yes, my child graduated from 
Pomeroy Elementary. Gee.

33:45.149 --> 33:48.173
Most of Pasadena's growth has been over the last 30 
years. What impact has your family had in

33:48.714 --> 33:53.440
contributing to Pasadena's progress during this 
period?

33:57.305 --> 34:12.625
You know, I have to confess that the Pomeroy impact 
was in the earlier days, in the formative stage,

33:57.305 --> 34:12.625
the setting up of the basic foundations for the 
community, the basic institutions, and they had a

33:57.305 --> 34:12.625
tremendous impact. Although there weren't near 
as many people, they were extremely visible in

34:13.060 --> 34:18.567
participating in what they did. In the last 30 
years or so, one of

34:19.268 --> 34:35.170
the things I have to relate to you is sort of an 
agreement my grandfather had. When he married my

34:35.190 --> 34:42.460
grandmother in 1811 and inherited a 
brother-in-law, Clyde McMaster, They decided

34:42.710 --> 34:48.441
they were going into business together, one of the 
businesses I mentioned earlier. John was a farm

34:50.104 --> 34:52.949
boy type thing. He was, as I said, sort of slow, 
easy, and he was mechanically minded, and it was

34:52.969 --> 34:59.962
hard, hard work. It had to be all of his luck. 
Applied, had had been around quite a bit. He had

35:06.758 --> 35:09.662
participated in some of the drilling for oil 
wells. And he had this engine, and he had worked

35:09.682 --> 35:19.134
with farmers on rice farms in a pretty good area 
around the state. And he was sort of a

35:19.154 --> 35:22.158
wheeler-dealer-mover type guy. And so my 
grandfather says, I'll tell you what, Clyde. He

35:24.781 --> 35:28.866
said, I'll keep working with the water well 
business, and I'll keep the money coming in. And

35:29.427 --> 35:32.871
why don't you take care of the community 
obligations for us? I've got my church. And at the

35:34.786 --> 35:36.528
time, he had the school board. He did a little 
school board in there. He said, you just take care

35:40.955 --> 35:42.917
of the other things. So Clyde McMaster sort of took 
over the homeroom responsibility for community

35:42.937 --> 35:49.046
involvement. Clyde was mayor of Pasadena

35:49.066 --> 35:56.997
1931 to 1939.

35:58.462 --> 36:00.925
There was only one other mayor that was in office 
for eight years. That was Delbert Atkinson. That

36:03.508 --> 36:06.071
followed, immediately followed him. Clyde was 
there when the community made a radical change in

36:07.092 --> 36:17.545
the 30s from the farming warring community into 
what is now an industrial community. So he was part

36:17.745 --> 36:24.773
of that driving force that pulled us sort of out of 
the dark ages, if you will. Clyde was also a charter

36:25.647 --> 36:29.373
member of the Rotary Club. He got my grandfather to 
participate because he thought it was important

36:29.393 --> 36:32.878
that we do that. But Clyde was the type of person 
that says, well, what we need to do is get the

36:33.539 --> 36:37.204
businessmen together. Grandfather...

36:45.777 --> 36:51.486
The business had grown beyond the community, 
probably within the last 30 years or so. It took him

36:51.787 --> 36:52.768
out of town. And he was not in town all that much. 
Continued to hire from the local community.

36:57.193 --> 36:58.254
Talked very good about that. Continued to 
influence the churches, as I mentioned earlier.

37:02.219 --> 37:05.523
But in the school board, up until 19... When was 
that? Well, I

37:09.427 --> 37:16.495
had... Up into the, oh, 1934. Then you get into the 
40s and on, and he's off doing his business as he's

37:17.875 --> 37:27.067
left it to Clyde and also my uncle, Everett 
Williams, one of the Williams family I mentioned

37:17.875 --> 37:27.067
earlier. He was involved in city council. He was 
the water commissioner in town. He was also chief

37:32.734 --> 37:41.606
of the volunteer fire department for a period of 
time and a lifelong member of the volunteer fire

37:32.734 --> 37:41.606
department. Not until the

37:41.626 --> 37:47.393
last... I'd say five years or so that we got 
re-involved in the community. And most of that

37:54.792 --> 37:57.155
involvement has been through myself. I had been 
away for a period of time. I'd lived in Ohio and I'd

38:00.320 --> 38:02.542
been off to college and all that. When I came back to 
the community, my grandfather had retired and my

38:02.562 --> 38:08.470
father had the business. My great-grandfather 
Clyde, I mean, my great-uncle Clyde McMaster had

38:09.192 --> 38:20.867
died also, so it wasn't that many of the 
Pomeranians left, and the rest of them had moved

38:09.192 --> 38:20.867
out of the community into retirement areas. So I 
felt some sort of responsibility.

38:26.434 --> 38:35.325
One thing was preserving the history of the 
community, so I got back involved in the history of

38:26.434 --> 38:35.325
the community and became president of the 
Historic Society for a couple of years and

38:26.434 --> 38:35.325
continued to write their newsletter. I got 
involved... in the Chamber of Commerce. I felt one

38:39.690 --> 38:51.325
of the things that the community needed was some 
statistical information for, or community

38:39.690 --> 38:51.325
information, really, beyond statistical. You 
need statistical for businesses that want to come

38:51.345 --> 38:55.430
into the community or communities that want to 
grow. And they said, well, what's the population

38:55.450 --> 38:57.653
of the community? Where is the population? What 
are the trends? What's your employment level?

39:02.479 --> 39:04.301
Economic scale and all of that. So I got very 
involved in pulling together that type of

39:06.533 --> 39:09.656
information to make it available. Also, 
promotional materials about the community. Not

39:12.298 --> 39:18.303
only, I call them promotional, but people coming 
into the community and saying, what is Pasadena?

39:18.383 --> 39:19.324
What's the quality of life? What's the religious 
atmosphere? What's the school atmosphere? Those

39:22.006 --> 39:23.027
types of things. So we've tried to pull that 
together so that these people will know what

39:23.367 --> 39:27.131
Pasadena is. And then the often overlooked area 
that you want to communicate with is the people

39:27.611 --> 39:34.337
within the community. They live there. They work 
there. And quite often, they say, well, I don't

39:35.947 --> 39:39.953
really know what Pasadena is. I didn't know that 
about Pasadena. And so we're trying to, we're

39:42.177 --> 39:47.665
pulling together, we're promoting Pasadena to 
Pasadenas.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.732
Some of us feel there's an image problem. Well, 
we're trying to work on that. We're trying to get

39:53.234 --> 39:56.459
the people of Pasadena first to feel good about 
Pasadena. When we feel good about our community,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.324
then it radiates. And other people know. And 
that's half of the publicity promotion jobs want.

40:05.528 --> 40:09.394
I got drafted into Rotary, as I mentioned earlier. 
And there's been involved in quite a few things in

40:09.414 --> 40:14.281
promoting the community. So Palm Roys are again 
shaping the direction of the community.

40:25.778 --> 40:31.526
In your opinion, what are the reasons behind 
Pasadena's tremendous growth and change over the

40:25.778 --> 40:31.526
last several decades? Well, let's put it And let me 
give you sort of an overview. The community was

40:38.161 --> 40:43.728
founded in 1895,

40:38.161 --> 40:43.728
97 era. It depends on where you want to draw the line 
in the beginning, okay? In the 1890s, railroads

40:48.474 --> 40:51.678
were put into the era. Up to that point, it was just 
ranching. And with the railroads, there came a

40:54.322 --> 41:00.570
group of promoters that said, hey, let's open this 
up, sell some land.

41:02.232 --> 41:03.514
The cities of La Porte, Deer Park, Deepwater, 
Seabrook, Kima, Genoa, South Houston, and

41:04.490 --> 41:16.746
Pasadena all came into existence within about 10 
years of each other. Today, Pasadena is 125,000

41:16.766 --> 41:20.130
people. And if you combine the populations of all 
those other communities, you might get 60,000.

41:28.762 --> 41:30.724
They all started out basically the same way. Some 
of them had a little more advantages. Pasadena was

41:34.055 --> 41:37.178
the only town that didn't have a hotel. First thing 
a developer did was to build a hotel. You'd run an ad

41:40.582 --> 41:45.707
in New York or Illinois or Indiana and have people 
come down to buy land. The promised land, the

41:45.807 --> 41:48.730
sunbelt. For that reason, they had it. And they'd 
come and they'd stay in the hotel. Well, Pasadena

41:54.356 --> 41:56.919
didn't have a hotel. By 1910, 1920, La Porte had a 
couple thousand people. Deer Park had a couple of

42:03.721 --> 42:11.292
hundred people, and Pasadena would have had less 
than a hundred. But Pasadena, for some reason,

42:11.312 --> 42:15.699
eventually attracted more people. It got rid of 
people from deep water and said, well, I think I'm

42:16.280 --> 42:19.845
going to go over to Pasadena. I've got a couple of 
real cute stories on that. And Pasadena just,

42:22.429 --> 42:29.560
perhaps with palm oil and water, was able to grow as 
an agricultural center. And we grew more than any

42:30.451 --> 42:33.754
of the other cities. We continued as an 
agricultural community on into the 30s. Now, our

42:39.179 --> 42:43.102
character changed in the 30s. The Houston Ship 
Channel, which was a dream of the people from

42:44.323 --> 42:54.512
Houston, and they had been working on it since 
pre-1900,

42:44.323 --> 42:54.512
started promoting it as a ship channel. They 
dredged it out. They got an oil company by the name

42:56.494 --> 42:59.597
of Sinclair to come and build a place in 1917. 
Forgotten. Crown came the year before, Crown

43:05.584 --> 43:08.829
Refinery. They had all this oil down in 
Spindletop, Goose Creek, and Baytown. And the

43:13.175 --> 43:16.559
people in Houston says, well, gee, we ought to have 
a shipping port. If we refine it here instead of

43:16.579 --> 43:25.792
sending it up to those Standard of Indiana and all 
that Sinclair people up there, we need it here. So

43:25.832 --> 43:28.736
they started promoting Houston Ship Channel. 
Well, that was going on in the background Pasadena

43:30.357 --> 43:31.759
more or less ignored it. That's on its northern 
boundary. And it was looking south where all the

43:33.961 --> 43:35.803
farming was. And we were shipping. And that just 
sort of existed back there. But in the 1930s, 1937,

43:39.007 --> 43:45.994
Champion Paper decided to open up a mill in 
Pasadena. Because one of the major industries in

43:46.014 --> 43:52.101
Houston was a lumber. Jesse Jones, who most 
everybody knows, was very big in the lumber

43:52.141 --> 43:58.368
business. Champion decided to open up a mill. When 
Champion opened, they hired several hundred

44:00.530 --> 44:02.613
people. And what happened there was that it 
provided a choice to the labor market. Labor

44:09.481 --> 44:14.608
market up to this point, when you worked, you 
worked until the end of the season, you got your

44:09.481 --> 44:14.608
pay. But with the industry, you got paid every 
week. And you had a job 52 weeks out of the year, 53,

44:18.152 --> 44:22.137
how many years there is. So the choice was, okay, 
well, let's go to work for the industry. The

44:26.963 --> 44:30.267
industry also needed more than the local market, 
so it started bringing people in. As they brought

44:30.618 --> 44:32.840
people in, they needed houses. Houses and people 
needed grocery stores and laundries and movie

44:33.321 --> 44:39.848
houses and city government. So 37 became a major 
turn in the shift in Pasadena. This was just the

44:47.856 --> 44:52.501
beginning of a just phenomenal growth in the 
community. It came from 2000 in the first half. of

44:56.437 --> 45:01.925
Pasadena's existence to now under 25,000 in the 
second half, basically equal periods of time. But

45:03.007 --> 45:08.315
37 was the beginning.

45:08.335 --> 45:22.697
Although we didn't, the United States didn't 
enter into World War II until the 40s, the effect of

45:08.335 --> 45:22.697
the war was felt locally in Pasadena as early as 
1938-39 because the U.S. people and industry

45:23.521 --> 45:26.727
supported the war effort in Europe. So we geared up 
the petroleum industry down here with the oil

45:27.188 --> 45:33.401
refining to provide petro for the allies. We also 
worked on chemicals with Sinclair Chemical

45:33.841 --> 45:39.673
Corporation, which is now

45:41.763 --> 45:46.169
Petrotex, well, Arco is the refining side of 
Petrotex. It's the chemical side of the deal.

45:47.972 --> 45:50.756
Goodyear Rubber, all of these started about that 
period of time. Houston Shipbuilding and Brown

45:51.237 --> 45:57.426
Brothers Shipbuilding started at that time, and 
they employed thousands of people. So all of a

45:57.446 --> 46:09.964
sudden this community that had supported some 
farms and one or two small refineries, then a paper

45:57.446 --> 46:09.964
mill with about 500 people, is now an employment 
center for thousands and thousands of people. So

46:10.332 --> 46:19.644
the communities just started growing in leaps and 
bounds.

46:19.664 --> 46:23.208
To give you an example, in 1940, the population of 
Pasadena was 3,400. It had grown seven times by

46:24.710 --> 46:29.056
1950 to 22,000.

46:30.097 --> 46:40.170
It grew two and a half times during the 50s to 58,000 
in the 60s and continued to grow at the rate of about

46:30.097 --> 46:40.170
3,000 a year on up through the 1980s. Now, one of the 
perennial questions I have is, why Pasadena? I

46:46.040 --> 46:51.105
mentioned Deepwater, Deer Park, the port, South 
Houston, all of those communities. What happened

46:51.145 --> 46:51.866
there? Well, Deer Park was all but abandoned when 
Shell came in in the late 30s. And so they had to

46:59.854 --> 47:04.659
start from scratch as far as a community. It was 
strictly a veteran community associated with

47:04.679 --> 47:08.082
Shell. The port's orientation was supposedly to 
shipping. Because it was the port of opportunity.

47:15.888 --> 47:18.933
That's what the port was supposed to be. But they 
had developed over the years Sylvan Beach. So it

47:21.296 --> 47:24.381
became the playground, the recreation 
community. And everything was related to that.

47:26.925 --> 47:32.754
They didn't take, they weren't in a position to 
take advantage of what's happening during World

47:26.925 --> 47:32.754
War II. South Houston is rail-oriented. It's not 
port-oriented. So they were not directly able to

47:38.335 --> 47:42.541
take care, to take advantage of the industry. 
However, the first aviation in the area was in

47:42.901 --> 47:47.187
South Houston. They had the first airplane 
manufacturing facility in Harris County that I'm

47:47.208 --> 47:51.674
aware of. And Allentown Airport space was built 
because of that during World War I. Okay? And then

47:57.282 --> 47:59.565
reactivated in World War II. We had the first, the 
largest bomber school in the nation or something

47:59.585 --> 48:06.314
during World War II out of Delaware. But those 
didn't provide a strong economic base, as did the

48:08.390 --> 48:11.635
industry. Again, the shipbuilding stuff, the 
chemical and petroleum directly related to

48:11.655 --> 48:15.442
Pasadena. And Pasadena was in place, now had 
government, it had the basic services, and we just

48:15.602 --> 48:27.381
took advantage of what was there. We attracted a 
couple of influential, that is, dynamic people

48:27.562 --> 48:34.954
into the community. And they took the lead as far as 
providing development.

48:42.618 --> 48:52.587
Delbert Atkinson was one of those people, as was 
Herbert Tarter,

48:42.618 --> 48:52.587
Anderson. They formed the real estate 
development firm of Tarter, Atkinson, and

48:53.228 --> 48:58.772
Anderson. And all of the stuff along Tarter 
Street, which was renamed in Herbert Tarter's

48:59.253 --> 49:05.498
honor, was all a development. They knew how to work 
the government programs. They got the funding for

49:08.188 --> 49:09.811
the houses. And so they were throwing up houses as 
fast as you could possibly do it. But the industry

49:14.878 --> 49:21.287
and the housing, we were able to capture the 
people. Our growth has continued to track that at

49:21.307 --> 49:26.154
the Houston Ship Channel. As it has diversified 
and there's more chemical companies and the

49:26.174 --> 49:32.643
shipping has increased, we've been able to take 
advantage of that. And we've continued the

49:32.663 --> 49:34.506
initial momentum. Strong with the churches, 
strong with the schools, so we're a strong family

49:34.992 --> 49:39.754
community. We had a tremendous number, in fact, 
probably the basis for our growth during this

49:40.375 --> 49:46.804
period, people that came out of East Texas. They 
were coming to Pasadena to make money in the

49:47.385 --> 49:52.813
industry, and then they were going back to East 
Texas. They never made it back to East Texas.

49:55.637 --> 49:56.298
They're still here. They still keep saying, I'm 
going to go back to East Texas. A lot of them have

50:00.124 --> 50:04.370
retired, back to East Texas, and said, well, my 
friends are back in Pasadena. So they moved back to

50:04.730 --> 50:06.813
Pasadena. So we've continued that. We were also 
able to take advantage of what happened down in

50:09.940 --> 50:18.429
Clear Lake with NASA and the stuff that was 
developing down there. When Exxon was developing

50:18.449 --> 50:24.755
Clear Lake, it was developed as an executive-type 
town. A lot of the non-managerial workers were

50:24.775 --> 50:32.263
located in Pasadena because the housing was 
cheaper. It had a good school system and the other

50:32.884 --> 50:36.868
things that we mentioned before. So we've been 
able to take advantage of that. In the last 10

50:40.417 --> 50:43.886
years, we've got a new type of growth going on in the 
community. It's not so much in numbers as it is in

50:44.568 --> 50:49.260
quality, quality of life in the community. Up 
until the late 50s, Pasadena sort of viewed itself

50:49.882 --> 50:56.299
as a bedroom community. If you wanted anything in 
the way of culture, entertainment, all those

50:56.903 --> 51:02.869
types of things, you went to Houston. If you wanted 
a good place to eat, you went to Houston. This was a

51:06.012 --> 51:08.114
local community with basic services. What with 
the oil crisis in the 70s, it got expensive to get to

51:08.734 --> 51:14.440
Houston for number one. The city was growing so 
fast that the road system was not that adequate, so

51:14.460 --> 51:20.105
it began to take longer to get into Houston. Some of 
the racial problems they had in Houston, People

51:23.768 --> 51:28.034
said, well, I think I just want to stay in my own 
community. So in the last 10 years, five years,

51:28.054 --> 51:38.190
three years, we've started saying, hey, we need to 
provide some of those things in our own community

51:28.054 --> 51:38.190
ourselves. And so we've got this new form of 
growth. And as we provide those things, it begins

51:40.513 --> 51:52.611
to attract more in the way of professional 
services, more attorneys, accountants,

51:40.513 --> 51:52.611
doctors, the medical profession in this 
community in the last 10 years is phenomenal. The

51:55.845 --> 51:57.467
quality change that we've gotten. The hospitals. 
I wouldn't have come to passing a hospital 10 years

51:59.070 --> 52:04.739
ago or five years ago. But now we've got some 
outstanding things. We've got some equipment

52:06.401 --> 52:12.491
that are second only to the Texas Medical Center. 
Better than any place else in the world. We're tied

52:14.654 --> 52:18.260
to the Texas Medical Center with the emergency 
helicopter service. So if they can't handle it

52:18.280 --> 52:20.944
here, they can get you into Houston.

52:26.898 --> 52:28.260
We talked about religion. Religion, as always, 
had an important role in Pasadena. Was your family

52:32.485 --> 52:35.610
involved in Pasadena's religious community? 
Well, I think we beat that horse to death. We've

52:40.296 --> 52:41.878
covered that before. I hate to repeat a lot of the 
things that I've said in the past, but in a

52:42.779 --> 52:52.332
nutshell, yes, I believe we have. religion is a 
very strong thing. It continues to be a very strong

52:55.269 --> 52:58.312
thing. It has shaped the communities in some ways 
positive, some ways negative. We don't have all

53:04.479 --> 53:07.943
the denominational beliefs in the community. I 
don't know if it's because the Protestants have

53:09.745 --> 53:16.072
just spread their elbows and said, no, this is our 
territory, or what it's been. I know the Catholics

53:17.313 --> 53:21.998
tease a little bit about having to fight their way 
into the community.

53:30.246 --> 53:36.561
Let me just wrap that up by saying that religion has 
played a significant role in the community. It

53:37.638 --> 53:38.719
does today. The religious community is very much 
involved. It's an outreach type religion. It's

53:43.523 --> 53:47.427
not a, you know, you just come to us on Sundays type 
thing. It caters to the needs of all the people.

53:50.029 --> 53:57.536
It's going out aggressively after specialty 
groups, battered wives and alcoholism. The

53:58.156 --> 54:05.603
Catholic group put together and all the other 
religious communities supported this Pasadena

53:58.156 --> 54:05.603
family time. which is the objective there is to 
bring the family a little closer together. Some of

54:10.848 --> 54:19.016
their specific programs is like on a certain 
night, you pledge that you will spend the evening

54:10.848 --> 54:19.016
with your family and family activities. The 
restaurants and towns have given discounts. If

54:21.538 --> 54:25.903
you bring your family in on like Thursday night, 
you get 10% off and those types of things. So, you

54:25.923 --> 54:33.650
know, religion is a very dominant force

54:25.923 --> 54:33.650
in the community. You know, one of those little... 
sort of funny type things you like to throw in from

54:35.198 --> 54:38.181
time to time. I hope it doesn't ruffle anybody's 
feathers. But one of the contributions that

54:40.783 --> 54:51.313
religion has made to the community, it's a strange 
partnership with Sherwood Pryor, who owns the

54:40.783 --> 54:51.313
Gillies. It seems that Pasadena at one point was 
sort of the late bloomer in the prohibition era.

54:59.401 --> 55:04.446
Although the United States had prohibition back 
in the 20s and came out of that, the Baptists

54:59.401 --> 55:04.446
decided back in the late 40s that, gee, we ought to 
have prohibition in Pasadena. And so they got

55:10.272 --> 55:15.198
together, organized a group, and voted Pasadena 
dry. So you couldn't buy alcohol or serve alcohol

55:16.119 --> 55:19.444
and say, well, it's Pasadena. Election came back 
up in the 50s, and I don't know if this necessarily

55:20.205 --> 55:33.842
is true, but I've heard that the bootleggers and 
the bear joints around the outside of the city

55:20.205 --> 55:33.842
provided money to the Baptists to underwrite the 
campaign to continue to keep Pasadena dry. so the

55:34.109 --> 55:35.691
competition would stay out of the area. Since 
then, Pasadena has incorporated a lot of areas,

55:37.895 --> 55:42.462
and everybody's afraid to bring the issue up. So 
the new areas, you can have outfall. They're wet.

55:46.488 --> 55:49.372
The old areas of Pasadena, you can't have outfall. 
And everybody's afraid to bring the issue up,

55:49.392 --> 55:57.404
afraid it'll go one way or the other, so we have a 
divided city.

55:57.424 --> 56:01.230
What was the fabulous 50s like for the Pomeroy's in 
Pasadena? Well, since I was a teenager in the

56:01.413 --> 56:06.180
fabulous 50s, it was fabulous. Fabulous 50s for 
Pasadena was a breaking out of the old downtown

56:06.260 --> 56:14.371
area. In the early 50s, well, the commercial 
district of Pasadena centered around 225 and

56:14.391 --> 56:26.728
parallel street would be Shaw, just north of that, 
and ran from Shaver, to Main Street, about two,

56:26.978 --> 56:29.762
three blocks. And that was, everything was within 
that area. City Hall, all the commercial

56:33.327 --> 56:35.931
establishments. With the 40s, we had had, you 
know, Woolworth came into town, and we had dress

56:36.311 --> 56:46.806
shops, and specialty clothes shops, and movie 
houses, and, you know, we were high cotton there.

56:46.826 --> 56:53.796
In the 50s, with the population, as I mentioned 
earlier, now up to 22,000, we ran out of room. We

56:53.945 --> 56:55.266
started growing south. All of the old strawberry 
farms became subdivisions. And you look at the

56:58.129 --> 57:01.994
subdivision names, and you can see who owned land 
there. There's McMaster and Pomeroy

57:02.014 --> 57:03.876
subdivision. There's a Park subdivision one, 
Park subdivision two, Park subdivision three.

57:07.860 --> 57:09.442
There's a Parker subdivision. All of the old 
names, also on the streets. But we had the first

57:13.406 --> 57:19.592
commercial step out, really. Sears, well, a guy by 
the name of John Campbell came to Pasadena. And he

57:23.442 --> 57:24.924
built the Campbell Centers. Now the Campbell 
Centers were down in Southmoor. Southmoor was

57:27.507 --> 57:35.017
just probably gravel when he started it, probably 
blacktop when he finished it. Everybody thought

57:35.037 --> 57:41.206
he was crazy because you couldn't even see 
Southmoor from Pasadena. But he started that out

57:41.226 --> 57:42.908
there. There were a few subdivision houses out 
there. Carter and Atkinson were accommodating.

57:47.168 --> 57:50.591
Campbell built a few homes of his own, so they 
started growing out there. He got Sears to come out

57:51.072 --> 57:56.277
to his shaver and south wall. And all of a sudden, 
you know, the downtown was moving away.

58:01.021 --> 58:03.884
Businessmen downtown made a mistake. Or the 
government. I'm not sure. I don't know exactly who

58:05.165 --> 58:06.206
did it. They decided we're going to raise some 
revenue. We're going to put in parking meters. So

58:10.090 --> 58:12.472
they put in parking meters downtown. And, of 
course, everybody just complained about putting

58:12.492 --> 58:15.775
pennies in a parking meter. There were pennies 
there. So when Campbell built his thing,

58:18.978 --> 58:26.810
advertising, free parking, the merchants 
downtown said, wait a minute, so there was, like on

58:18.978 --> 58:26.810
Thursdays you could park downtown free. But it was 
a losing battle because the handwriting was on the

58:28.192 --> 58:31.056
wall. I first passed it in the state bank, realized 
that, and moved out to Southmore and Carter in the

58:31.076 --> 58:39.889
early, I think 1960s when they opened up out there. 
City Hall opened up out there at the same time.

58:42.704 --> 58:44.386
hospitals. The two downtown hospitals closed and 
new ones opened up. First Baptist Church moved

58:50.955 --> 58:57.744
from its original location in the old downtown 
area into the new neighborhoods. So we had a

58:58.365 --> 59:03.491
tremendous shift going on there. Unfortunately, 
there was a guy by the name of Corrigan, Leo

59:03.972 --> 59:07.817
Corrigan from that came into Pasadena in the late 
40s and said, boy, I'm going to build me a super

59:08.320 --> 59:13.648
shopping center. And we built it in the old 
downtown area. And by the mid-50s, everybody was

59:16.092 --> 59:19.077
leaving downtown. But it was great for me because, 
boy, there was a movie theater right down the

59:19.097 --> 59:22.863
street. I'd ride my bicycle down here to the 
Saturday matinee, go in at 9 o'clock and come out at

59:22.883 --> 59:28.852
4 in the afternoon. I used to pick blackberries 
there a couple years earlier. And the drive-ins

59:32.738 --> 59:37.542
came to town, you know, the drive-in restaurants 
where you would go to Trainers. You may not even

59:38.663 --> 59:40.464
remember Trainers. Trainers is now where 
7-Eleven is over there by the port, 225. That was a

59:44.148 --> 59:46.249
drive-in. Down at the other end of town was the 
Corat. And, you know, in the 50s, we'd get in our

59:53.375 --> 59:58.740
cars and we'd drive down to the Trainers and we'd 
drive around to see if we knew anybody. And then

59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.543
we'd drive down to the other end to see if we knew 
anybody, try picking up somebody in between. That

01:00:04.092 --> 01:00:06.135
was the day of American Band Standing. That was 
probably, that was the decade I learned to dance.

01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:14.666
We had, although the band just don't give a dance, 
even the men just do, okay? But that's all right.

01:00:16.188 --> 01:00:19.653
It's not Sunday, you know, you do what you want. And 
learned to dance, teen canteen type thing.

01:00:25.862 --> 01:00:27.284
That was back in my courting days. The Hugh Pastino 
Rodeo, okay, it starts back in the 50s. Mm-hmm. And

01:00:34.552 --> 01:00:43.202
I forgot to mention that the biggest recreational 
activity in town was the Pasadena Miniature Golf

01:00:34.552 --> 01:00:43.202
Course, which my parents built. And I was the 
manager when I was nine years old, or something

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:47.807
like that, 11 years old. I was the manager. Yeah, 
I'd babysit the cash register, drink the Cokes,

01:00:48.528 --> 01:00:53.894
and eat the peanuts and snow cone. But there was 
nothing else in town, really. Everybody came over

01:00:56.617 --> 01:00:59.480
and played miniature golf course. It was a lot of 
fun, playing miniature golf at the golf course.

01:01:03.745 --> 01:01:03.985
There we go. that was the beginning of the era just a 
second there was one other i have to do have to

01:01:04.387 --> 01:01:32.487
digress there was another activity in town which 
was the skating skating rink skating pasting it

01:01:04.387 --> 01:01:32.487
was terrific thoroughly enjoyed it between the 
captain skating rink miniature golf course

01:01:04.387 --> 01:01:32.487
school parades and all those types of things i had a 
very full life thoroughly until i had a horse too

01:01:04.387 --> 01:01:32.487
who didn't uh 50s were also From a city government 
standpoint, Pasadena was getting some strain on

01:01:32.804 --> 01:01:38.270
the city government. The town was growing very 
fast. We had a part-time city government. We had a

01:01:43.936 --> 01:01:46.078
part-time mayor, we had a part-time councilman. I 
think the councilman got like $50 a week and the

01:01:46.758 --> 01:01:51.804
mayor got $150 a month, and the mayor got $150. The 
city was growing, we're talking pushing 50,000

01:01:51.824 --> 01:01:56.989
people, 9,000 people by the time we got to the end of 
the 50s. And it began to show in the government

01:02:00.709 --> 01:02:06.716
because some of these people were putting in quite 
a bit of time and not getting any more

01:02:00.709 --> 01:02:06.716
compensation. So there was some scandals going on 
in government. They were taking a little money on

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.162
the side. They were using city employees to fix up 
certain things of theirs. And it was only into the

01:02:15.186 --> 01:02:23.176
early 60s that we were having left with a couple of 
mayors that were at least reviewed for

01:02:15.186 --> 01:02:23.176
indictment. And finally, the community realized 
that, gee, we do need some full-time city

01:02:28.289 --> 01:02:30.452
officials. And so we changed the city charter and 
we went through some sort of change in that period

01:02:30.472 --> 01:02:41.991
of time where the mayor became a full-time job and 
they could afford to pay at that time $20,000,

01:02:30.472 --> 01:02:41.991
$25,000, which was good money. So we could attract 
some people. City councilmen still continue to

01:02:43.974 --> 01:02:46.438
get small funds. It's viewed as a part-time job, 
but they still spend a lot of time. But we had a

01:02:51.266 --> 01:02:55.933
psychological change in our government format.
