00:04.925 --> 00:12.118
This is an interview with Dr. William B. Harris, 
professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M

00:04.925 --> 00:12.118
University. Today's date is October 12, 1981. 
Let's begin, Dr. Harris, by you telling us

00:15.744 --> 00:23.077
something about your early years in Loveland, 
Colorado. You were born there in 1919. Well,

00:26.677 --> 00:36.448
Loveland, Colorado is probably the best part of 
the world to be born in and raised as a boy because

00:26.677 --> 00:36.448
it's the so-called gateway to Estes Park or the 
Rocky Mountain National Park. It's 50 miles north

00:36.468 --> 00:38.310
of Denver. And I went to school, grade school and 
high school in Loveland. In 1933, 37, I should say,

00:46.139 --> 00:53.007
I went to the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
What was your father's occupation? He was a

00:55.263 --> 01:10.563
retired farmer who had gone into the insurance 
business and actually had done pretty good as a

00:55.263 --> 01:10.563
farmer and the insurance was something to keep him 
out of the house, I believe. How did he happen to

01:12.986 --> 01:16.391
settle in Colorado? My folks were all pioneers, I 
guess. The type that crossed the prairies and

01:20.176 --> 01:24.882
settled the west. For example, a first irrigation 
ditch in Colorado was dug and created by my

01:25.553 --> 01:34.548
grandfather. Where did your grandfather 
immigrate? He came from Missouri, northern

01:36.891 --> 01:39.676
Arkansas. I'm not exactly sure, but it was part of 
the throes of the aftermath of the Civil War. I know

01:52.520 --> 02:04.230
that at one time they had a lot of land with a lot of 
slaves and this all got torn up so most of the family

01:52.520 --> 02:04.230
moved to Colorado. A rather interesting story 
there. My grandfather went to Colorado with a

02:05.772 --> 02:16.161
covered wagon and the woman he married was with 
another covered wagon train. The two of them met in

02:16.221 --> 02:18.283
what is now Denver. At that time it was Arvada. 
white spot on the river. What was that? Arvada,

02:25.391 --> 02:26.592
Colorado. It was just a little bit. A-B-A

02:28.215 --> 02:35.164
A-R-V-A-D-A It's now a suburb of Denver. Anyhow, 
my grandmother was out in the middle of the road

02:36.025 --> 02:41.893
with her bloomers tucked up out of the river, 
washing clothes. Granddad apparently rode out on

02:42.493 --> 02:49.763
his horse out there to look at her and announced to 
the world he was going to marry her, which they

02:42.493 --> 02:49.763
eventually did. I used to get a lot of interesting 
stories about the Wild West that I, the pioneers

02:51.295 --> 02:58.864
that I wish I could remember. Some of them are 
absolutely fascinating. People had a different

03:02.188 --> 03:05.712
attitude toward life then than they do now, that's 
for sure.

03:09.637 --> 03:18.147
I had a great uncle who put the first dam across the 
big Thompson River for irrigation, which is still

03:09.637 --> 03:18.147
there and still being used. with a home supply 
ditch corporation.

03:25.653 --> 03:30.761
In any event, we went to 37, graduated from high 
school, and went to the university. What year did

03:30.781 --> 03:32.203
you graduate? 1937. And went to the University of 
Colorado to take chemical engineering. Chemical

03:39.233 --> 03:42.598
engineering was not too well known at that time. 
But I'd had chemistry in high school, which was

03:43.912 --> 03:52.024
great fun because we were allowed to make 
firecrackers and various other things, which

03:43.912 --> 03:52.024
they no longer allow students to do. And since I 
liked mechanisms in general, chem engineering

03:53.366 --> 03:59.595
sounded like a good thing to go into. This, of 
course, was a four-year curriculum. And due

04:04.422 --> 04:09.970
course, we graduated and went to work at Buffalo, 
New York, with the National Aniline Division of

04:10.304 --> 04:14.590
Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation. What was 
that again? National Aniline Division of Allied

04:15.912 --> 04:20.319
Chemical and Aniline. A-N-I-L-I-N-E.

04:25.166 --> 04:28.552
This is a dye stuff corporation. And dye stuffs are 
rather complex organic chemistry. It's rather

04:35.422 --> 04:37.425
interesting in those days most of the organic 
chemical industry was based upon coal and then of

04:38.063 --> 04:52.945
course switched over into what we call 
petrochemicals made from petroleum and now we're

04:38.063 --> 04:52.945
in the process of switching back to sort of where I 
started out, benzene and things like this from

04:38.063 --> 04:52.945
coal again. This was a rather interesting job. I 
started out in production for about a year and

04:56.731 --> 05:05.404
apparently made such a pest of myself they moved me 
over into the research department which is in some

04:56.731 --> 05:05.404
ways rather disastrous since everybody else had a 
PhD in chemistry and it wasn't quite the place for a

05:06.127 --> 05:14.016
BS chemical engineer. Turned out it was very good, 
however, because they had a policy there that for

05:15.778 --> 05:35.661
every new process that was developed by the 
research department, it was taken out and

05:15.778 --> 05:35.661
demonstrated in the plant before the production 
people were given the progen.

05:36.772 --> 05:45.981
This is something that does take chem 
engineering, so I ended up doing much of the chem

05:36.772 --> 05:45.981
engineering for the entire research department, 
which was a great experience. The fact is, I guess I

05:46.001 --> 05:52.366
got involved in about every chemical reaction 
that's labeled except the Grenard reaction. But

05:54.048 --> 06:06.019
this would be involved, they'd call me in and say, 
Dr. So-and-so's got a process that uses 35 ether

05:54.048 --> 06:06.019
extractions, which is impractical and also can't 
use ether in the plant. Harris take it out of the

06:07.180 --> 06:14.610
plant and make it, which is chem engineering 
rather than basic research in chemistry. And so I

06:14.650 --> 06:17.474
enjoyed it quite a bit. I did not like Buffalo very 
well. How long were you there? I was there six

06:21.860 --> 06:22.881
years. What happened is the war broke out in 1941 
and of course the war disrupted everything.

06:32.003 --> 06:39.973
I got shifted off into this research program, and 
one of the things I was working on was what they call

06:32.003 --> 06:39.973
Atabrin, or Quinacrin, which is an anti-malarial 
drug. Can you spell those? A-T-A-B-R-I-N, and

06:42.256 --> 06:55.091
another name for it is Quinacrin, Q-U-I-N,

06:42.256 --> 06:55.091
Q-U-I-N-E, Quinacrin. I think that's right. It's 
been a while. Anyhow, the Japanese had taken over

06:58.818 --> 07:14.031
all the South Sea islands where the quinine was 
produced, and it was impossible for us to invade

06:58.818 --> 07:14.031
the South Sea islands and conduct any kind of a war 
program without quinine. So someone captured

07:14.952 --> 07:18.535
some German soldiers in North Africa. The 
Germans, being very methodical, had pre-planned

07:19.435 --> 07:28.403
all this, and they had developed an anti-malarial 
that worked somewhat similar to quinine. And so

07:29.513 --> 07:37.100
they brought some of the tablets back, and we were 
given the job of mass producing this for our armed

07:29.513 --> 07:37.100
forces. As a result, I never did serve in the armed 
forces. I spent my time working with this adamant,

07:41.704 --> 07:59.200
which incidentally is a very yellow material, and 
after you work with it a while, you begin to look

07:41.704 --> 07:59.200
like you were made of yellow rather than white.

07:59.517 --> 08:05.366
met my wife in Buffalo, New York, which was one of 
the pluses of the area. They also had us, of course,

08:07.089 --> 08:19.928
frozen into our jobs as well as frozen into our 
salaries, so that the first six years of my life, as

08:07.089 --> 08:19.928
far as increasing my salary is concerned, were 
pretty non-productive. It turned out that if you

08:19.988 --> 08:23.213
were a union man, a laborer, You could get periodic 
raises, but if you were on salary, you were frozen

08:23.834 --> 08:29.399
at whatever salary you had. So just about every 
supervisor in the plant was making less money than

08:29.479 --> 08:40.629
the most menial of workers, which is some kind of a 
commentary on politics in general.

08:41.410 --> 08:44.653
I never did like Buffalo simply because it's too 
dang cold. The winter lasts approximately nine

08:44.753 --> 08:51.259
months, and the summer a couple of days type of 
thing to me. So as soon as the war was over and I had

08:52.707 --> 09:06.888
the opportunity, I moved to Benson, Arizona, 
which is about as far from snow and cold as you can

08:52.707 --> 09:06.888
get, and went to work with the Apache Powder 
Company of Benson, Arizona. What year was this?

09:08.230 --> 09:09.372
This would be in 1946. But you worked in Buffalo all 
through the war? All through the war. You see, you

09:14.519 --> 09:16.282
couldn't change your job then. And as soon as I 
could get out of Buffalo, I got out. How did your

09:21.310 --> 09:22.251
wife feel about leaving? She didn't much care for 
it. For leaving it? For leaving it. Now she will

09:28.018 --> 09:35.387
kind of grin and say it was probably the best thing 
we've ever done, but at the time it was quite a

09:28.018 --> 09:35.387
strain on things, I'll have to admit that. 
Particularly going as far as Arizona, which got

09:36.969 --> 09:44.117
her away from her parents a long distance and 
homesick, and a total change. Around Buffalo it

09:44.237 --> 09:49.984
was very green and verdant, and the Arizona desert 
is just the opposite. Arizona is a pretty good

09:51.078 --> 09:53.300
place for a man to live. There's a lot of hunting and 
rough country to play in, but for women, there's

09:53.420 --> 10:05.272
not even, people in Benson, which is only 900 
people in the town, 960, didn't even grow grass in

09:53.420 --> 10:05.272
their yards. It was all sand and it was kind of a 
desolate area, so she never did like it very well. I

10:10.658 --> 10:12.660
enjoyed it because I had a very good job. I went 
there as a research engineer, chemist. In those

10:18.746 --> 10:19.887
days, chemists in the chem engineers weren't as 
well differentiated as now. And after being there

10:25.071 --> 10:31.962
about three and a half years, the company decided 
to about triple its size. And this whole task was on

10:33.644 --> 10:40.895
my shoulders, which was a very interesting thing. 
I'd never gotten involved in construction and

10:40.955 --> 10:49.047
design before like that.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.022
I designed the buildings. I hired the crew. I laid 
out narrow gauge railroads and did all kinds of

10:52.463 --> 10:58.672
things that I would never have thought as a chem 
engineer I would ever be doing. And in the midst of

11:00.194 --> 11:06.282
all this, I got promoted to the title of technical 
supervisor for the company. So I was in charge of

11:07.523 --> 11:18.578
their engineering and development, the product 
quality control program, customer relations,

11:07.523 --> 11:18.578
safety and health, which is a big thing in an 
explosives plant. In general, anything that had

11:19.874 --> 11:26.904
any technical aspects to it was under my charge. I 
enjoyed it. It was a good job. It was a small town,

11:31.991 --> 11:34.274
which I have always enjoyed. My wife didn't like 
it, and the job was very demanding. In those days,

11:42.908 --> 11:46.011
they didn't have what we call human engineering 
now. The general idea was if you worked hard eight

11:46.071 --> 11:54.440
hours a day and didn't worry, someday you could be 
the boss and work 16 hours a day and have all the

11:46.071 --> 11:54.440
worry. I was working usually from 70 to 80 hours a 
week, which means just about all your waking time.

12:02.469 --> 12:04.831
But when you enjoy it, this is not particularly 
bad. It's bad for your family. This was brought

12:08.676 --> 12:10.958
home to me very much because One Sunday, I was out at 
the plant with the plant manager. We were going

12:14.940 --> 12:23.051
over a bunch of blueprints by ourselves, a big 
empty office building, of course. And the PX board

12:23.892 --> 12:27.296
started buzzing, so I plugged it in. And it was 
Stanford University calling the plant manager to

12:27.336 --> 12:39.932
tell him that his son had just been found in the 
automobile

12:27.336 --> 12:39.932
with an exhaust hose stuck into the window and, of 
course, was dead by suicide. This was of course a

12:41.633 --> 12:51.104
big tragedy and the plant manager jumped in the 
company car that we had there and took off

12:41.633 --> 12:51.104
immediately and left me there to call my wife to 
come and get me. So I had about a half hour of

12:52.265 --> 12:56.871
thinking before my wife got there. And I could 
pretty well perceive why this poor kid had

12:56.891 --> 13:05.481
committed suicide because his dad had been too 
busy all the time to really be much of a father. And

13:06.794 --> 13:13.403
since he had the best job in town, his mother felt 
like she was sort of the queen bee of the society and

13:06.794 --> 13:13.403
didn't have much time either. So they had great 
expectations for the boy, but he was just a sort of

13:14.284 --> 13:20.472
an average kid and couldn't live up to these 
expectations. Then I got to thinking I had a son who

13:22.294 --> 13:33.949
was about three years old, about two and a half 
perhaps, that I hadn't seen awake for at least five

13:22.294 --> 13:33.949
to six weeks. You know, you just look in the door and 
see them laying there, and I got to thinking,

13:34.587 --> 13:38.132
that's pretty dumb. By the time my wife got out to 
the plant, I told her I was going to quit, figuring

13:39.714 --> 13:50.208
that she'd probably raise the roof one way or 
another, and all she did was say, great, let's move

13:39.714 --> 13:50.208
back where my folks live. I told her no. I was going 
to find a job that was dignified, that I didn't have

13:54.514 --> 13:59.641
to be ashamed of. It was in a relatively good 
climate. a cultural place that had things to do and

14:03.764 --> 14:07.948
good schools for children. But I'll be damned if I 
was going to spend the rest of my life trying to

14:09.149 --> 14:22.601
become a plant manager or president of the company 
because it's just there were too many things you

14:09.149 --> 14:22.601
had to sacrifice at that time at least in order to 
have that type of work. So in casting about, it

14:22.621 --> 14:30.568
looked like a university environment here at 
College Station was just about the best thing that

14:22.621 --> 14:30.568
would fit that mold. Certainly a nice climate. a 
job that you don't have to be ashamed of, a cultural

14:33.768 --> 14:48.567
place, good schools, and close enough to Buffalo 
that you can make it once or twice a year, which is

14:33.768 --> 14:48.567
enough to visit in-laws generally anyhow. So I 
came here to work initially as a research engineer

14:50.951 --> 15:03.387
with the Cotton Seed Products Research 
Laboratory, which was part of the TEAS at that

15:04.160 --> 15:07.123
time, and that was in 1953.

15:09.746 --> 15:16.214
So I stayed approximately six, six and a half years 
at Apache Powder and then moved here. Of course,

15:16.474 --> 15:20.018
I've been here ever since. The Cotton Seed 
Products Research Laboratory at that time

15:20.038 --> 15:28.588
concentrated entirely on, or almost entirely on, 
cotton seed problems. There were about 500 cotton

15:29.469 --> 15:31.872
seed oil mills in the state at that time. It was a big 
industry and appropriate that the college

15:33.505 --> 15:41.055
conduct research in this area. It was funded by a 
separate granting from the Cotton Research

15:41.075 --> 15:48.866
Committee, which was a division of the state 
legislature.

15:52.031 --> 15:59.361
In the process of this work, people, myself and 
others at the, and prior to me actually too,

16:01.012 --> 16:18.959
developed considerable improvements in the 
handling and processing of cottonseed which of

16:01.012 --> 16:18.959
course the idea is you get cottonseed oil which is a 
edible made into margarine or cooking oil and lint

16:01.012 --> 16:18.959
and holes and other products that are useful 
elsewhere.

16:26.670 --> 16:28.453
We started working and on solvent extraction of 
cottonseed oil, which was a better process than

16:28.636 --> 16:36.985
the hydraulic processes that had been employed. 
One of the characteristics of this, though, it

16:38.847 --> 16:56.247
becomes more and more like a chemical engineering 
plant, which lends itself to all-year production

16:38.847 --> 16:56.247
rather than seasonal operation, and huge 
operations rather than comparatively small

16:38.847 --> 16:56.247
localized plants. And I understand as a result of 
that now the number of oil mills in the state of

16:57.779 --> 17:11.819
Texas has dwindled to a small, a very small 
fraction of the roughly 400 or 500, about 500 that

16:57.779 --> 17:11.819
were here when I first came. As a result, the 
oilseeds laboratory or cottonseed laboratory

17:11.839 --> 17:22.875
has gone through a progression of names and I think 
it's now called the Food and Protein Research

17:11.839 --> 17:22.875
Center as they've shifted into different areas. 
as the need for research and the number of

17:23.598 --> 17:33.390
companies involved has become limited in the 
cottonseed industry of Texas by itself. About

17:35.052 --> 17:45.805
1958, we had a change in administration in Tees and 
the School of Engineering. We got a new dean, Dr.

17:45.825 --> 17:48.829
Calhoun. who came in with the concept that people 
who do research should teach, and particularly

17:50.092 --> 17:58.239
people that teach should do research. Dr. Calhoun 
is now vice president of engineering and

17:58.980 --> 18:04.725
renewable resources.

18:09.068 --> 18:18.917
So one day, rather unexpectedly, I got a phone call 
informing me that I was now also an associate

18:19.201 --> 18:24.065
professor in the Chem Engineering Department. 
Did you work in graduate programs? No. I hadn't

18:28.008 --> 18:36.175
even been inside a classroom since I got out in 
1941, and all of a sudden I was going to teach a

18:28.008 --> 18:36.175
course the following Monday.

18:39.058 --> 18:48.786
Kind of perturbed me, but the head of the 
department at that time, Dr. Lindsay, just sort of

18:39.058 --> 18:48.786
grinned and says, well, you'll find that you know a 
lot more than the students do, so you'll make out

18:39.058 --> 18:48.786
all right, which which turned out to be a very true 
statement. So I started teaching part-time for

18:52.116 --> 19:01.391
the chem engineering department and researching 
part-time then in the cotton seed products

18:52.116 --> 19:01.391
laboratory. That was in 58. This was in 58. I

19:02.873 --> 19:16.714
found, as many people do once I got started in 
teaching, that this was a very fascinating

19:02.873 --> 19:16.714
occupation and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.340
I had some problems. When I came here, one of the 
conditions was that I would be allowed to go ahead

19:21.101 --> 19:26.047
and get an advanced degree. And I had started on my 
master's program, but of course we have in the

19:27.309 --> 19:43.849
catalog rules against granting advanced degrees 
to people who are ranked as professors at the

19:27.309 --> 19:43.849
university, which is a perfectly understandable 
restriction. And because of the salary I made as a

19:45.213 --> 19:56.106
research engineer, I had been classified as an 
associate professor, which meant that

19:45.213 --> 19:56.106
theoretically I wasn't supposed to get an 
advanced degree. I was able to convince everybody

19:57.627 --> 20:14.427
that I'd already been started on this program and I 
should be allowed to finish, and so I got my

19:57.627 --> 20:14.427
master's of chemical engineering here at A&M in 
1960.

20:14.744 --> 20:19.369
I was blocked from going any further as far as 
getting an advanced degree here at A&M. I could

20:20.290 --> 20:28.660
take all the graduate courses I wanted, but they 
were meaningless as far as applying to any kind of a

20:20.290 --> 20:28.660
degree program. I proceeded to take graduate 
courses. I got a whole armload of them, but

20:33.085 --> 20:43.857
primarily just, I guess, for my own edification 
because it did not enable me move ahead as far as

20:44.039 --> 20:48.424
becoming a PhD was concerned. So all during the 
60s, I was working then under two hats for the

20:50.126 --> 21:00.498
cottonseed lab and for chem engineering 
department. And gradually, 1960

21:00.518 --> 21:07.166
or 61, I'd have to look it up now. It's amazing how 
insignificant it is now and how important it was at

21:07.266 --> 21:12.612
the time. But this didn't, I ran into some problems 
here because of course to get promotions within

21:14.212 --> 21:28.285
the organization here, particularly in the 
teaching area, you really ought to have something

21:14.212 --> 21:28.285
more than a master's degree. And I felt that I 
needed to do something, but at the same time I was

21:30.087 --> 21:44.100
making such a salary that I couldn't afford to just 
take off and go somewhere and get a PhD and then

21:30.087 --> 21:44.100
hopefully return. About 1969, the legislature 
passed a law permitting the colleges to fund

21:45.802 --> 21:55.135
sabbatical leaves. So I immediately applied for a 
sabbatical leave, which was granted, to go ahead

21:55.155 --> 22:04.648
and study to get a PhD. And my understanding, this 
was the only one that was granted for the, to go

22:06.411 --> 22:15.724
ahead and work on an advanced degree at the The 
people who put this program together decided one

22:17.257 --> 22:24.624
of the very first rules was that no one would be 
given a sabbatical to do this.

22:27.507 --> 22:39.179
Dean Benson, however, was then in charge of the 
Engineering and Experiment Station, and he was

22:27.507 --> 22:39.179
able to convince whoever was involved that this 
would be an appropriate thing. So I did get this

22:39.219 --> 22:42.022
sabbatical leave. So in 69, I went to the Colorado 
State University. Fort Collins, Colorado. Now,

22:50.302 --> 22:58.313
one of my reasons, of course, was I enjoyed 
Colorado when I was young, and I wanted to get back

22:50.302 --> 22:58.313
into that area as much as possible. But the main 
reason was I had gotten into a very, very

22:58.333 --> 23:07.406
interesting subject in the cottonseed research 
work, which was the cooling of cottonseed. These

23:07.426 --> 23:10.310
piles of cottonseed cost well over a million 
dollars. And of course, they're organic and

23:11.492 --> 23:14.877
subject to mold and spoilage. So the way they 
control this is pulling air through the pile of

23:17.888 --> 23:29.985
seed to a collecting duct system on the bottom of 
the pile and air cools the seed and dries it out so

23:17.888 --> 23:29.985
that it stays without degradation.

23:32.468 --> 23:38.757
The equations for this kind of thing though is a 
typical fluid flow through porous media type of

23:32.468 --> 23:38.757
thing. It's the same as you have there for 
underground oil reservoirs or hydrology science

23:46.880 --> 23:47.943
of aquifers. It turns out that Colorado State 
University is probably one of the best places in

23:49.186 --> 23:57.947
the world to study fluid flow through porous 
media. And I kind of struck a deal with the

23:59.109 --> 24:04.382
agricultural engineering department there. 
who, probably agricultural engineers, have been

24:05.780 --> 24:20.738
more interested in fluid flow through porous 
media for longer, I guess, than the petroleum

24:05.780 --> 24:20.738
people, because, of course, this is involved in 
the movement of moisture to the plants, and

24:05.780 --> 24:20.738
particularly involved in irrigation, which 
Colorado is a great irrigated area. So, since that

24:23.081 --> 24:33.593
was my interest, I went to the ag engineering 
department rather than through a normal chemical

24:23.081 --> 24:33.593
engineering department somewhere else.

24:36.357 --> 24:49.630
And I'm kind of proud of this because I spent one 
year at Colorado and did get my PhD, which is

24:36.357 --> 24:49.630
probably I guess a world record for getting a PhD. 
One reason I was able to do this though is that they

24:51.251 --> 25:00.160
allowed me to use the research that I had been doing 
for the cotton seed products laboratory as the

24:51.251 --> 25:00.160
basis of my thesis. So mainly the problem was 
getting the course credits out of the way.

25:06.515 --> 25:15.606
Unfortunately, only 12 hours of my courses here 
could be transferred and the rest of it I had to take

25:06.515 --> 25:15.606
at location in Colorado. While I was in Colorado, 
they had a reorganization of the cottonseed

25:17.729 --> 25:31.947
products research laboratory and had kind of come 
to the conclusion that this split work between two

25:32.956 --> 25:36.560
departments was not very, really the best way of 
handling things. And apparently in my absence

25:36.660 --> 25:49.594
there was a big discussion as to whether I would go 
back and work full time for the cottonseed lab or

25:36.660 --> 25:49.594
full time for the chem engineering department. 
And I don't know exactly just how, what all

25:49.614 --> 26:00.246
happened, but I was informed while I was gone that 
when I came back I would be a full time employee of

25:49.614 --> 26:00.246
the chem engineering department. So since then, I 
have not been active in the cottonseed research or

26:02.673 --> 26:10.023
food proteins research area.

26:14.589 --> 26:32.612
I

26:14.589 --> 26:32.612
think it was 1973 before I finally got my thesis 
approved and my dissertation approved and got my

26:14.589 --> 26:32.612
actual degree from Colorado State. Shortly 
thereafter, I was promoted to full professor in

26:33.807 --> 26:40.756
the Department of Chem Engineering, which I've 
been since, of course.

26:47.565 --> 27:03.105
I think our department has been a very good 
department because it has a good blend of people

26:47.565 --> 27:03.105
who are what I would call very theoretical, which 
you need in an academic area, and people who are

26:47.565 --> 27:03.105
very practical or engineering-oriented, which I 
consider myself to be. so that we all sort of

27:04.351 --> 27:07.034
complement each other.

27:09.898 --> 27:12.702
My research program has been for quite some time. 
We started back in 1963.

27:18.569 --> 27:26.719
I worked for about six months temporarily for and 
with Dr. Davison of the Chem Engineering

27:18.569 --> 27:26.719
Department on water desalination. And in the 
process of working on that, we got involved in

27:27.740 --> 27:31.405
solar energy. So when I became full time in the 
chemical engineering department, Dr. Davison

27:32.802 --> 27:43.834
and I continued working together on the solar 
energy research program. In the course of this, we

27:45.956 --> 27:54.426
came across what we think is a very, very, very 
worthwhile idea as far as solar energy is

27:45.956 --> 27:54.426
concerned. We kind of think at this moment that we 
were probably 10 or 15 years ahead of our time. But

28:01.557 --> 28:14.388
basically the problem with heating buildings 
with solar energy is that you want to heat

28:01.557 --> 28:14.388
buildings in the wintertime and you want to 
therefore collect the sun during the wintertime.

28:15.049 --> 28:18.852
But unfortunately the wintertime is winter 
because we don't have much sunshine. The real time

28:19.753 --> 28:28.060
to collect solar energy is the summer or all year 
round and then use this energy during the winter.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.282
So obviously one of the problems would be figure 
out how you could store solar energy for six months

28:30.869 --> 28:57.957
or longer periods without losing it and we came up 
with a very very useful concept

28:30.869 --> 28:57.957
which we call the solitaire system

28:30.869 --> 28:57.957
actually we came up with this concept quite some 
time before we actually got to any program going in

28:58.561 --> 29:04.208
chem engineering here, I mean in solar work here at 
the department. Basically what we proposed doing

29:05.910 --> 29:27.977
was pumping water from an underground aquifer, 
from a well in other words, particularly during

29:05.910 --> 29:27.977
the summer but all year long really, running it 
through solar heaters where the water would get

29:05.910 --> 29:27.977
hot and then take this hot water and pump it down 
another well back into the aquifer. And the

29:29.206 --> 29:42.162
concept is that the aquifer, this underground 
water-filled strata, is in essence a very, very

29:29.206 --> 29:42.162
cheap insulated mammoth storage tank. In other 
words, the ground is a very good insulator. So the

29:46.507 --> 29:58.622
idea is you store the hot water, and then when 
winter comes, you pump the hot water out from under

29:46.507 --> 29:58.622
the ground around the various buildings like we 
have here on the campus, which all the buildings

29:46.507 --> 29:58.622
are heated by hot water being pumped from the 
powerhouses.

30:01.454 --> 30:11.970
This has a lot of merit, and besides the fact that 
you collect the energy all year round, you no

30:01.454 --> 30:11.970
longer have your capital that you've put into the 
solar heaters just sitting idle most of the year

30:01.454 --> 30:11.970
and used only during the winter. And since the 
solar energy business is totally capital

30:12.872 --> 30:16.918
intensive, this is very important. But the solar 
heaters operated during the summertime are much

30:18.881 --> 30:26.533
more efficient than during the winter. because in 
the winter solar heaters are surrounded by ice

30:27.610 --> 30:38.762
cold air and they lose a good share of their energy 
to the surrounding air whereas in the summer they

30:27.610 --> 30:38.762
are surrounded by much warmer air and their 
efficiency is therefore better. So not only do you

30:39.824 --> 30:57.263
use your capital all year round you can collect 
about five times as much energy per square foot of

30:39.824 --> 30:57.263
heater or per dollar is worth a heater but the 
heaters are more efficient and since this kind of a

30:39.824 --> 30:57.263
system would use a very large solar heating array, 
you get away from the very expensive idea of

30:57.580 --> 31:07.272
putting very small heaters custom made and custom 
installed on each building. It becomes a utility

31:07.292 --> 31:09.755
type system.

31:12.739 --> 31:19.067
It also became rather apparent in this that if you 
can store hot water underground, you can store

31:12.739 --> 31:19.067
cold water. So the analog is to take the pump water 
out from under the aquifer during the winter,

31:20.529 --> 31:27.317
spray it into the air, a spray pond, get it close to 
freezing using the natural coolness of the winter

31:28.242 --> 31:34.212
and store cold water. And then of course in the 
summer you would air condition your buildings

31:35.094 --> 31:44.290
just as they're done here again on the campus by 
pumping chilled water from a central source to the

31:35.094 --> 31:44.290
various buildings. This, if you look at it, is 
economically a very, very, very attractive way of

31:46.033 --> 31:52.123
getting air conditioning. So we had this scheme 
called the Solitaire Scheme which appears to be

31:54.010 --> 32:08.146
economic and answer and solve the problems that 
keep solar energy from being widely used. It had

32:09.948 --> 32:10.768
one trouble. You can't do it on a small scale. You 
can't store a small quantity of water anywhere. It

32:17.316 --> 32:23.022
has to be a large quantity stored underground and 
therefore it becomes a rather expensive

32:23.744 --> 32:24.806
installation. It's fine for say air conditioning 
a campus but it wouldn't work at all for air

32:24.826 --> 32:30.594
conditioning a home. Nor can you actually study it 
in the laboratory. There's no way you can build a

32:36.303 --> 32:44.154
sand pile or something and put a little water in it 
and expect it to stay hot until next summer. So even

32:45.336 --> 32:50.123
though you can model and the work that I've done 
Colorado State on my PhD was in the area of aquifer

32:50.997 --> 33:19.958
flow through porous media you can model and you can 
show in a mathematical sense exactly what's going

32:50.997 --> 33:19.958
to happen but since it costs roughly a million 
dollars or so to put one of these systems in we

32:50.997 --> 33:19.958
haven't been able to find anyone with a million 
dollars yet everybody that has the money that

32:50.997 --> 33:19.958
looks at it and says it's a great idea show me one 
that's working And of course, there is none

33:21.288 --> 33:24.732
working. So that has been a problem. We did get a 
small grant from the Department of Energy to study

33:25.674 --> 33:34.365
the storage of cold water, which we did out on the 
river bottom farm. We knew that we wouldn't be able

33:35.606 --> 33:48.983
to store the water because that was a 65 foot deep 
aquifer, which is almost like a sandbar out in the

33:35.606 --> 33:48.983
river, and a considerable amount of water 
movement through that type of a formation. But at

33:49.537 --> 33:52.882
least we were able to demonstrate that the system 
was feasible. As a matter of fact, we put down out of

33:54.204 --> 34:18.160
a pond that was only 50 foot by 100 foot over 10 
million gallons of ice cold water underground,

33:54.204 --> 34:18.160
which means that on a good cold night in the winter 
here, this 50 by 100 foot pond was approximately a

33:54.204 --> 34:18.160
200 ton air conditioner, where the only power cost 
was for the cost of spraying the water into the

34:18.697 --> 34:22.422
spray. So you can see it has a great advantage over 
refrigeration because you're using the natural

34:22.562 --> 34:32.576
cold air to do the cooling. This particular 
cooling thing is being tried, this will be tried

34:32.596 --> 34:43.290
this winter in a shopping center in Tuscogee, 
Alabama. Where?

34:49.595 --> 34:51.757
K-O-G-E-E. I think it's the capital of Alabama. 
Anyhow, it's where the University of Alabama is

34:53.919 --> 34:56.402
located.

35:00.126 --> 35:03.569
We're a little bit concerned because we don't know 
what kind of an aquifer they have. Tuscaloosa.

35:06.392 --> 35:07.433
Yeah, Tuscaloosa. I'm sorry. Tuscogee, that's 
Florida, isn't it? I think you were getting

35:11.157 --> 35:13.500
Tuscaloosa and Tuskegee. Okay, all right. But 
anyhow... If they have a good aquifer, we've seen

35:17.860 --> 35:22.226
blueprints of the surface installation. It looks 
like they'll be able to use this system to good

35:22.287 --> 35:25.992
advantage. And we hope that once somebody has one 
that they can deep walk up to and kick, that other

35:26.072 --> 35:36.067
entrepreneurs then won't be so reluctant to put 
their money in. Because this particular concept,

35:36.127 --> 35:42.957
as Department of Energy have estimated, that 
after it started, within about 10 years, it should

35:43.780 --> 35:51.227
save about $12 billion worth of oil per year. We 
think their estimate for the number of

35:53.370 --> 36:01.538
installations is low, but the profit at each 
installation is possibly a little bit high. But my

36:01.578 --> 36:08.345
feeling would be, if the idea catches on, that it 
should save considerably more than $12 billion.

36:09.185 --> 36:13.770
We almost got the Kennedy International Airport 
air conditioned with this system, They put so many

36:14.273 --> 36:24.165
restrictions about spraying water into the air, 
which might cause fog, which might create

36:14.273 --> 36:24.165
hazardous conditions and so forth. They never 
were able to get it materialized.

36:28.810 --> 36:34.157
The other area we've been working in is in the 
alternative energy of automotive fuels. We had

36:36.059 --> 36:42.627
noticed in 1973 that the price of methanol, methyl 
alcohol, It dropped so low that it, on paper at

36:43.585 --> 36:50.474
least, would be cheaper to use alcohol as an 
automotive fuel than gasoline.

36:53.418 --> 36:57.464
This was true, but only for a momentary aberration 
of the market. But it was enough to get us

36:57.484 --> 37:00.868
interested in alcohol fuels.

37:03.512 --> 37:11.803
And at about the same time, the oil embargo hit, 
which indicated that the country may not be able to

37:12.188 --> 37:18.255
enjoy all the petroleum that it's been used to, and 
there'd be severe dislocations. And it became

37:19.657 --> 37:34.956
apparent to most thinking people, I think, that 
we're going to have to go to coal, of which we have

37:19.657 --> 37:34.956
approximately a fifth or fourth of all the world's 
resources, as our energy source, rather than

37:19.657 --> 37:34.956
petroleum.

37:34.976 --> 37:38.280
And we began to think that we perceived some tunnel 
vision on the people. that when something like

37:39.290 --> 37:46.717
this, that cars run on gasoline,

37:39.290 --> 37:46.717
gasoline can be made from coal. So when the price is 
right, this is what we will do. As chem engineers

37:52.082 --> 37:56.086
and looking at the various processes, we find two 
things. First, that the making methanol from coal

37:56.166 --> 38:05.214
will probably always be less expensive than 
making gasoline just by nature of the process.

38:06.795 --> 38:07.356
Secondly, The technique or the technology for 
making methanol from coal is firmly established,

38:08.197 --> 38:24.713
whereas the gasoline from coal processes are very 
iffy and technically need a great deal of work

38:08.197 --> 38:24.713
before they really are worked out to the point that 
they ought to be used. So our concept was that if

38:26.635 --> 38:35.503
cars can run on methanol, and if methanol is less 
expensive, we should start running our cars on

38:26.635 --> 38:35.503
methanol. However, when we began looking into it, 
we found quotations such as one from Chevron, for

38:36.614 --> 38:50.109
example, where they said they had spent hundreds 
and hundreds of thousands of dollars studying

38:36.614 --> 38:50.109
methanol as an automotive fuel. And that 
concluded it would never be a suitable fuel for

38:50.149 --> 38:53.793
automotive use.

38:57.657 --> 39:01.642
It turns out the reason for this is that the alcohol 
takes about eight times as much. Well, there was

39:01.662 --> 39:03.904
another form of tunnel vision, really. which went 
something like this gasoline is a liquid you feed

39:05.217 --> 39:30.938
gasoline through a carburetor alcohol is a liquid 
obviously you should feed it through a carburetor

39:05.217 --> 39:30.938
the problem is this doesn't work because alcohol 
takes eight times as much heat to vaporize as does

39:05.217 --> 39:30.938
gasoline

39:05.217 --> 39:30.938
and your car just cannot furnish this amount of 
heat so that when you try to run a carbureted

39:31.205 --> 39:36.430
alcohol car while the car really will run rather 
well. At the same time, you're spraying a mist or a

39:37.310 --> 39:43.876
fog into your cylinders rather than a vaporized 
fuel. And this has a number of problems. First, it

39:47.039 --> 39:49.241
makes it very difficult to start the car. An 
alcohol carbureted car is generally, without

39:49.301 --> 39:54.005
help, won't start below 50 Fahrenheit. But some of 
these droplets don't burn. They get on the walls of

39:57.569 --> 39:59.170
the cylinder. where they tend to wash the 
lubricant off of the cylinder. And as a result, you

40:05.554 --> 40:09.098
get enhanced wear. Other problems also, some of 
the droplets get down into the crank case where

40:11.720 --> 40:26.254
they precipitate the stream wear additives that 
are in the oil and otherwise react with the oil so

40:11.720 --> 40:26.254
that the film strength of the oil is cut about 50%. 
means it's no longer as good a lubricant as it was.

40:29.001 --> 40:31.004
So you have additional problems. And lastly, 
methyl alcohol in the crankcase will form formic

40:32.085 --> 40:42.939
acid, which is corrosive and detrimental to the 
engine. So looking at all of these things, we

40:42.959 --> 40:54.975
decided that the route to go would be to vaporize 
the alcohol and feed that into the engine rather

40:42.959 --> 40:54.975
than carburet liquid into the engine, which 
presumably putting in vapor will get rid of all

40:55.242 --> 40:58.725
these wear problems. And it does one other thing. 
It enables us to make a dual fuel vehicle, which

41:00.647 --> 41:07.034
will run either on gasoline or on alcohol vapor. In 
other words, the vapor system can be superimposed

41:07.874 --> 41:13.600
on any given alcohol engine. We started working on 
this, and have been working pretty steadily on it

41:13.620 --> 41:18.685
for the last several years. And what we think we 
have is a car that is perfectly drivable,

41:25.010 --> 41:34.225
acceptable that runs on either gasoline or 
alcohol with no change in drivability that's

41:25.010 --> 41:34.225
noticeable. And so we think we have at the moment 
probably the only viable economic and acceptable

41:36.649 --> 41:52.114
alternative to letting the price of gasoline 
continue to rise with the rise in OPEC prices

41:52.769 --> 41:58.895
simply because an alternative now does exist to 
make methyl alcohol and use it as a fuel. Well,

41:59.375 --> 42:07.923
methanol right now is selling for 77 cents, which 
is just about competitive with gasoline. But it's

42:08.303 --> 42:22.776
right now being made from natural gas, which is 
going up very rapidly in price and will go up much

42:08.303 --> 42:22.776
faster, I presume, as soon as they decontrol the 
price because natural gas has been held at an

42:08.303 --> 42:22.776
artificially low price for many years for 
political purposes. And we've been talking to

42:25.068 --> 42:29.935
various people, the continental oil people, 
Conoco. We've just converted two cars for them,

42:30.495 --> 42:33.780
their use. They are interested in methanol, 
unlike quite a few of the other oil companies,

42:34.381 --> 42:44.374
because they own Consolidated Coal Company, who 
owns the largest block of coal of any one company.

42:45.656 --> 42:53.286
They tell us that they can make, in 1980 dollars, 
methanol at the plant for 38 cents a gallon. Of

42:54.903 --> 42:58.026
course, you have to add your markups to that. Well, 
they haven't built those plants. They are

42:59.948 --> 43:03.811
planning to build, or were planning to build, five 
of them. Of course, they've just been merged with

43:03.831 --> 43:18.184
DuPont, which may change the entire spectrum 
there, because DuPont has been a producer of

43:03.831 --> 43:18.184
chemical methanol for years, and it's been a very 
profitable market for them. And if anyone were to

43:19.065 --> 43:24.370
make a fuel-sized plant, just one plant, talking 
in this small refinery, would be bigger than all of

43:24.890 --> 43:34.944
the alcohol plants that are now being produced, or 
the chemical market would just sort of evaporate

43:24.890 --> 43:34.944
or get submerged. We think, however, that it is the 
only alternative that exists at the moment, and we

43:36.286 --> 43:43.336
think it's a very good one. And what we anticipate 
is that the country may very well slide into what I

43:43.356 --> 43:52.028
would call the methanol economy, where at least 
our automotive industry vehicles and so forth

43:52.345 --> 43:55.928
will be running on methyl alcohol. When do you 
think that might occur? It will take quite a while

43:59.251 --> 44:10.882
because we have a tremendous sized gasoline 
inventory of cars and stations and refineries and

43:59.251 --> 44:10.882
so forth. But I think it may happen sooner than you 
might think. The Ford Motor Company people were

44:13.925 --> 44:21.812
here just about a month ago and they informed us, 
we've been dealing with them for quite a few years,

44:22.096 --> 44:32.232
and they've been kind of down on our alcohol bet for 
quite a while, but they informed us that it's now

44:22.096 --> 44:32.232
their corporate opinion that the fuel of the 
future may very well be methanol. Apparently this

44:33.354 --> 44:50.280
is because the oil companies seem to, by and large, 
all be changing their tune and taking a real

44:33.354 --> 44:50.280
serious look at methanol now, and have all been to 
the Ford company to see if they think cars will

44:33.354 --> 44:50.280
indeed be able to run on methanol. We think the 
system is a very useful system. It is, of course,

44:57.399 --> 45:05.233
the university has a patent posture in the system 
we devised. We kind of hope that eventually the

45:06.254 --> 45:17.213
university and the rest of us can all make some 
money out of this, but time will tell as far as that

45:06.254 --> 45:17.213
is concerned.

45:17.547 --> 45:34.293
What

45:17.547 --> 45:34.293
we have is a system that really is a kit that will 
mount on a car and allow it to be used for either

45:17.547 --> 45:34.293
alcohol or gasoline. Now, down the road, I would 
anticipate cars that run only on methanol, but we

45:35.114 --> 45:43.707
think it would be at least 20 years before we could 
switch over from one fuel to another. You can't

45:45.973 --> 45:50.039
just say on some set date everybody starts driving 
on methanol. It would take many, many years to

45:50.079 --> 45:53.745
build even the plants to produce that much fuel. 
And if you have to pay $10,000 for a car, I don't

45:55.047 --> 46:06.265
think very many people would like a car that ran 
only on alcohol and they had to stay within 100 or

45:55.047 --> 46:06.265
200 miles or something like that of their home 
base. So we think a dual fuel car at this moment in

46:07.186 --> 46:12.715
time is essential and it may may turn out to be the 
best route to go anyhow.

46:21.189 --> 46:39.411
We have licensed the, well I guess the best way of 
saying it is we have sold options to license this

46:21.189 --> 46:39.411
system in Canada and in the Netherlands, and we're 
having a lot of fun talking to all kinds of people

46:21.189 --> 46:39.411
from all over the world. I've met people I would 
never have met before in my life. For example,

46:43.981 --> 46:56.742
we've had three vice presidents of Exxon, three 
vice presidents of Shell, one vice president of

46:43.981 --> 46:56.742
General Motors, one vice president of Ford, 
president and vice...
