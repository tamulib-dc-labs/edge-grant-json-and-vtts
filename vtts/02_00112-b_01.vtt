00:02.967 --> 00:06.232
They hired McCarthy, fortunately.

00:06.252 --> 00:15.204
The other person they hired was the guy at Rice that sort of declined after he came here one day or something and turned around and declined it, which was good.

00:15.564 --> 00:17.888
McCarthy, what was your first name?

00:19.169 --> 00:20.611
Michael McCarthy.

00:20.631 --> 00:31.827
But I'm trying to think of the person that they made the original offer to at Rice because they had to start the search committee over and Sweeney was interim dean at that point in time.

00:31.807 --> 00:42.938
But the guy at Rice was an old style architect that had no clue about research or about anything else.

00:43.839 --> 00:52.368
And I think he got up here and kind of realized, well and his wife too, his wife was a socialite in Houston and she said she couldn't live in College Station.

00:53.069 --> 00:56.532
So they went on the next search and they hired Michael McCarthy.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.703
who was a really good move.

00:59.304 --> 01:11.064
A lot of the people don't like him but we had gone through Reed, Hicks and then an intern team for two years of where very little was happening in the college because nothing could happen.

01:12.306 --> 01:20.460
And Michael McCarthy, it wouldn't matter who they hired, the person would have been fired within four years if he changed anything.

01:20.947 --> 01:22.790
And he was a real visionary.

01:23.251 --> 01:28.100
He came in and established the visualization lab, you know, the animation program.

01:28.140 --> 01:36.456
He established all these different centers, you know, for urban development, for hazards research, all health stuff.

01:36.476 --> 01:40.002
The whole thing was established with him because that was the basis.

01:40.022 --> 01:44.170
You know, if you want a college running in the black, they have to bring in the research money.

01:44.150 --> 01:49.798
And did those programs, are they part of the reason for the growth in student enrollment?

01:49.878 --> 01:52.462
Yeah.

01:52.482 --> 01:59.392
If I'm not mistaken, we presently have more PhDs than any other university in the U.S.

01:59.412 --> 02:01.495
in colleges of architecture.

02:01.515 --> 02:04.740
I think we're the highest dollar value.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.146
It's usually between MIT, Georgia Tech, and Texas A&M.

02:08.647 --> 02:11.872
And I think we currently have the highest dollar volume going.

02:12.273 --> 02:15.498
But it's because of him that brought this in.

02:15.518 --> 02:18.864
Romnick of course encouraged it when he was there.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.328
He had a whole research division.

02:21.308 --> 02:29.197
And other schools of architecture around the country just looked like, oh, research, what's that got to do with architecture?

02:30.098 --> 02:33.122
And architecture is an art, not a science, et cetera.

02:33.742 --> 02:37.587
So McCarthy came in and made all these sweeping changes.

02:38.147 --> 02:51.062
He forced faculty that had been doing nothing but going to class and then going home or doing consulting, private consulting, to actually do papers, do research, or they didn't get raises.

02:51.042 --> 02:53.205
and they didn't get summer appointments.

02:53.225 --> 02:56.510
And they were furious, absolutely furious, outraged.

02:57.391 --> 03:09.068
And anyhow he brought in several high-paying, high-rolling faculty members and he had turned everything around and there's still a few better faculty

03:09.537 --> 03:11.479
You know, think he ruined the place.

03:12.640 --> 03:20.187
Or we even had students protesting the Visualization Animation Lab, which is like the golden child of architecture right now.

03:20.207 --> 03:29.335
But they were protesting it because computers were devil set, you know, and you should be doing hands-on stuff and things like that.

03:30.076 --> 03:37.182
So, and then he encouraged Wolfgang and hired Atith Shikawi for the land development.

03:37.162 --> 03:38.606
Who was that?

03:38.626 --> 03:39.509
Atif Shikawi.

03:40.131 --> 03:41.394
Can you spell that?

03:42.678 --> 03:43.661
He's on the faculty now.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.687
We have a directory up there.

03:46.443 --> 03:55.278
And then this Fred Forgey they've hired, but that's been a really good growing program and it's like one of four nationally.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.942
Then he's followed by Walter Windler.

03:58.683 --> 03:59.645
Where did Walter come from?

04:00.246 --> 04:04.473
Okay Walter went to Berkeley after he left Texas A&M.

04:05.254 --> 04:09.902
And then he went to teach at LSU.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.966
And then they hired him to come here.

04:13.006 --> 04:14.368
I think Greer probably hired him.

04:15.690 --> 04:19.535
And he got to be like assistant department head.

04:20.477 --> 04:24.102
And then McCarthy had him be associate dean.

04:25.303 --> 04:31.632
And then McCarthy was the one that put in that you really need PhDs if you're going to get research.

04:32.413 --> 04:37.560
And so Walter had been doing work toward his PhD.

04:38.317 --> 04:49.591
and had all but a year's worth of hours, and he made a deal with the education department at UT that he could come and be in residence for a year there, finish out the coursework, come back here and write his dissertation, which he did.

04:50.512 --> 04:56.200
And Walter's disciplined enough that he can do that, whereas most people would like trail off and never finish it up.

04:58.743 --> 04:59.804
But Walter was very good.

04:59.884 --> 05:02.788
Walter smoothed the ways after McCarthy.

05:04.034 --> 05:19.495
It's got, you know, everyone roughly off on any account, but kept going in the same direction, you know, with all the research and all the different papers and all the new directions and the animation and stuff like that.

05:21.803 --> 05:30.756
20 years plus of progress, what were some of the key steps in the growth and development of the program?

05:30.776 --> 05:31.837
Well, Romney was a key step.

05:31.877 --> 05:39.348
And then starting about 69, 70, 72, our enrollment was starting to grow at, you know, like 25 percent a year.

05:40.028 --> 05:46.157
And he made some very crucial hires of some very wonderful people, you know, during the 70s.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.565
Whereas other universities around the U.S.

05:49.585 --> 05:51.830
were cutting back, we were picking up.

05:53.273 --> 05:55.940
And Dan McGilvery was a crucial hire.

05:58.365 --> 06:01.272
Well several people through there were crucial hires.

06:02.034 --> 06:04.399
And Romnick had a really good feel for people.

06:04.379 --> 06:11.071
He could, you know, interview them and figure out where they were coming from, if they were really worth it, or if they were full of Mr. Romanek would put in shit.

06:12.994 --> 06:18.844
And then I think we went into a low point until McCarthy came.

06:20.225 --> 06:23.249
And then we were just holding on to our own.

06:23.970 --> 06:30.397
And we had all the brilliant faculty that Romnick had hired kept the place going.

06:30.417 --> 06:38.167
And then when McCarthy came we had another spurt of direction and research and new faculty hires.

06:38.747 --> 06:46.857
And then Wendlers made some great hires during that time too.

06:48.490 --> 06:52.315
You know, like landscapes, number two in the nation.

06:52.355 --> 07:00.205
The planning, you know, for urban and regional planning department would be number six in the nation and the only one that's located in a rural area.

07:02.668 --> 07:07.114
And the construction science is always either one, two, or three up there.

07:07.855 --> 07:13.502
Architecture is number one for computers and architecture.

07:13.482 --> 07:18.535
and then the research and all the different stuff that's happening.

07:18.775 --> 07:20.800
Well, the land development is one of four programs.

07:21.302 --> 07:25.873
They have a health care planning, which is one of five programs in the U.S.

07:27.096 --> 07:30.124
For our number one son, Steve,

07:30.104 --> 07:31.806
That was just the right program.

07:31.906 --> 07:33.268
Oh, yeah, it's perfect.

07:33.288 --> 07:41.237
He was not that good a designer for architecture, but his people qualities and all that has just worked well for him.

07:41.497 --> 07:48.185
All right, trace what Rodney Hill was doing then in the late 70s, 80s, and 90s.

07:48.545 --> 07:52.129
Well, when Romney left, I guess,

07:52.109 --> 07:56.280
I started teaching only freshman design and some sophomore.

07:58.526 --> 08:03.098
What was different about teaching first year instead of second year students?

08:05.052 --> 08:17.628
For me there wasn't that much difference other than the freshman you were getting from a range of backgrounds, you know, that were just like, that could have come from Vulture Gulch to a very sophisticated Lamar High School.

08:17.729 --> 08:19.811
Can you give some examples of those extremes?

08:19.931 --> 08:30.385
Well, I mean, you had kids from deep country that had an accent so strong, you know, from East Texas, and then some people that have traveled all over the world.

08:30.533 --> 08:36.527
What was interesting though, when they were doing their projects, about midway through the semester, it didn't matter where they were from,

08:37.081 --> 08:45.630
you know, the quality of their designability came through and it didn't seem to matter on their environment, you know, where they were from.

08:46.191 --> 08:56.001
Did you have any personal ways you developed where you tried to decide whether or not they had the creative ability to succeed in architecture?

08:56.242 --> 08:56.542
Yeah.

08:56.802 --> 09:04.050
Well, when I was developing it, you know, when I was doing the progressive relaxations and all of those, you know, I would just watch the students develop.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.733
And what I would try to do was,

09:07.878 --> 09:12.786
not look at where they were at that point in time but what they could be.

09:13.587 --> 09:29.532
Because a lot of times you would get to the last project and all of a sudden you'd see the light go on, you know, and they finally realized what was happening and that they were the source that, you know, education, you know, the old thing, education isn't something that's done to you but by you.

09:30.102 --> 09:31.043
They would just take off.

09:31.584 --> 09:41.896
And then what you tried to do was open as many doors as you can, giving them as many directions so they could take off and you wouldn't, you know, be impeding their forward progress.

09:42.376 --> 09:50.185
What about, do you have any stories, retrospective, where a student came to plead for mercy or ask for a second chance?

09:52.028 --> 09:53.229
Oh, yeah.

09:53.629 --> 09:54.430
Any good anecdotes?

09:54.450 --> 09:55.752
Every semester.

09:55.772 --> 09:58.455
There's someone always doing that.

09:58.435 --> 10:02.800
Do you remember any where you gave a second chance and now in hindsight it really?

10:03.381 --> 10:07.166
There were several I gave second chances to that in hindsight I won't do again.

10:07.666 --> 10:08.868
Oh, but you won't?

10:09.288 --> 10:09.489
Right.

10:09.529 --> 10:14.455
Well, some of them that said, please, please let me turn in an extra project.

10:14.535 --> 10:15.496
I'll do that.

10:15.556 --> 10:16.397
Let me graduate.

10:16.938 --> 10:20.382
Because if I don't graduate, you know, I've already got the invitations.

10:20.442 --> 10:21.784
My grandparents are flying in.

10:21.864 --> 10:25.388
So I'd let them graduate and they never came back with a project.

10:26.110 --> 10:30.116
And that's almost to a T. And I did that probably with about six students.

10:30.858 --> 10:37.008
What about on the other hand, some about whom you really had a lot of doubt, but now in hindsight they've turned out really well?

10:37.448 --> 10:39.191
Oh yeah, I mean, there's several.

10:39.411 --> 10:45.942
And there's Bill Peel, who I thought was just a really terribly average person.

10:47.693 --> 10:49.275
But he was a real good leader in the Corps.

10:49.876 --> 10:58.808
But I had suggested that maybe he needs to find another route.

10:59.349 --> 11:06.839
He was the first marketing director of 3DI and then CRS tried to get him away and he said no I just became marketing director.

11:07.280 --> 11:13.228
So the next year they came back and doubled his salary and he was responsible for bringing in like $20 million a month in work.

11:13.208 --> 11:28.298
Then he became CEO of Pierce, Goodwin and Alexander and now he's with Metro National which has holdings of about 50 million and he's one of three partners in that and all he's doing is entrepreneurial development work.

11:28.278 --> 11:32.644
But, you know, there's people like that that you think will never amount to anything.

11:33.445 --> 11:38.873
And there's several of those that showed little or no interest in architecture.

11:40.055 --> 11:42.358
And you just sort of closed your eyes and you let them graduate.

11:42.418 --> 11:50.590
And then six years later, all of a sudden, they're loving architecture and they're, you know, way high up in their firms and you're going,

11:50.570 --> 11:51.753
How did that happen?

11:52.775 --> 11:57.927
In all these design courses, how did you grade?

11:58.327 --> 12:01.595
How did you decide this was an A, B, C, or an F?

12:02.076 --> 12:02.838
That was the hardest part.

12:02.858 --> 12:03.699
It's all subjective.

12:03.960 --> 12:08.410
But usually what I'd do is I'd pile the projects all out on the floor,

12:08.390 --> 12:10.393
And then I'd put what I thought was an average one.

12:11.215 --> 12:16.022
And then I would go on either side of the average one and try to work the grades that way.

12:16.483 --> 12:26.179
And then a lot of times, if the person midway through woke up, you'd give a higher grade to encourage them.

12:26.159 --> 12:29.162
You didn't grade on the curve.

12:29.663 --> 12:31.105
No.

12:32.146 --> 12:35.890
Sometimes I had just superb classes and they might all get A's.

12:37.131 --> 12:42.197
And I taught mainly honors through the 80s and the 90s.

12:42.898 --> 12:52.048
So most of the classes I had were the top students anyhow, so I wasn't running across any really bad

12:52.957 --> 13:06.095
How did the quality of the students at their freshman year, how did it change from the late 60s to later years?

13:06.235 --> 13:08.819
Were they more capable?

13:09.940 --> 13:11.563
I'd say they're a little more capable than that.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.106
I mean, there's a whole different clientele.

13:14.206 --> 13:22.778
I would say most of the people that we got in the early 60s, late 70s, I mean early 70s, you know,

13:24.260 --> 13:31.559
Probably with admission standards right now, I would guess 80% of them wouldn't have made it into A&M at this point in time.

13:32.241 --> 13:40.041
So when you're asking them to do something now, research-wise, they wouldn't give you this blank stare.

13:40.021 --> 13:55.903
they'd be off and doing it because I could have a kid coming in from Plano that has already taught himself C++ computer language and is already prolific in several computer things and is turning in freshman projects that look like they're out of Pixar.

13:55.883 --> 13:59.232
and you're doing just unusual work.

14:02.160 --> 14:07.053
If the person had done that back in the early 70s, you would have phoned the National Press or Time Magazine.

14:08.958 --> 14:11.445
So I think you do see a big change.

14:11.425 --> 14:27.004
And I think that's probably some problems A&M's getting into now is parents who did go to school in the 70s and their kids are now wanting to get in and they're at the same level their parents were and there's no way they're going to ever get into A&M.

14:26.984 --> 14:34.194
Do you think in recent years you and your colleagues have been more rigorous because there's more talent?

14:35.136 --> 14:36.237
Are you more rigorous?

14:36.257 --> 14:37.158
Oh, I think so.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.100
Yeah.

14:38.520 --> 14:44.689
I think probably the grades may be about the same, but the quality's a whole lot better.

14:45.158 --> 15:06.947
A lot of times when I was grading, if a person that was just incredibly talented just didn't do anything but wrote on his laurels and was just doing what he did at a very good level but showed no improvement, I would give him a lower grade than somebody who came in not knowing from Shinola and then passed the kid up.

15:06.927 --> 15:15.756
So that was the only time I guess students would get huffy, that by comparison, you know, this person is not up to my level.

15:16.040 --> 15:25.650
In these years of change, describe the enrollment of women in growing numbers.

15:26.110 --> 15:28.032
What were the realities of that?

15:28.213 --> 15:28.493
Right.

15:28.513 --> 15:31.356
I mean, there'd be one or two, you know, in the class.

15:31.456 --> 15:34.359
And then, you know, it's just been a gradual increase.

15:35.120 --> 15:40.225
And I guess we're about 30 percent in the College of Architecture now.

15:41.006 --> 15:45.270
Did the male students tease them or pick on them at first?

15:45.250 --> 15:45.871
Not really.

15:46.031 --> 15:56.005
A&M students I've found to be more gentlemen, more Southern Tech, I think even.

15:58.589 --> 16:04.377
I've rarely found a crude male in the class.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.903
I've found a couple of crude females that would tease the males.

16:09.745 --> 16:15.072
You know, some naive male, that's happened before, but rarely have I seen males

16:15.052 --> 16:25.092
You know, I've heard about it in the Corps, but I've never, I think architecture is a little more liberal-minded about male, female, and gender roles and things like that.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.076
So I don't really see it.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.809
How has Corps enrollment, Corps student enrollment in architecture, how has it?

16:34.089 --> 16:36.975
Well, I mean if you had a design class.

16:36.955 --> 16:46.287
You might have one person or two persons in your freshman design class that would actually be in the Corps.

16:47.389 --> 16:50.753
And whereas before it was, you know, just almost half and half.

16:52.956 --> 16:59.925
The Corps, I think, does themselves in, or they're used to, like...

16:59.905 --> 17:14.783
Even in the honors group, say from about mid-80s to the present, there's only been two people in the Corps that started out in honors their freshman year that actually were in honors after one semester.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.226
The bonfire did them in.

17:18.548 --> 17:23.314
I had one kid that fell asleep.

17:23.783 --> 17:25.248
That's why I was looking for a while ago.

17:28.097 --> 17:30.063
He had mono.

17:31.408 --> 17:32.652
And I said, why don't you go to the health center?

17:32.672 --> 17:34.097
You don't have to go out and cut bonfire.

17:34.317 --> 17:35.481
And he said, I can't.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.464
let my core buddies down.

17:37.925 --> 17:38.946
And I said, that's nonsense.

17:38.966 --> 17:40.008
You know, you're going to kill yourself.

17:40.950 --> 17:49.444
And so what I did, I let him come in and just curl up on one of the laboratory ledges and sleep, because that was the only time he got any rest.

17:50.966 --> 17:54.432
And I let him turn his project in a month late.

17:55.711 --> 17:58.295
But he never got his grades back up.

17:58.796 --> 18:02.942
But that's been the case with most of the Corps, which I've told the Corps.

18:02.962 --> 18:07.008
I was a Corps advisor for, believe it or not, five years, one of the faculty advisors.

18:08.210 --> 18:16.622
And we went from, it was Squadron 5, went from last place to first place in that time.

18:17.817 --> 18:19.381
And I had a lot of fun with them.

18:19.521 --> 18:22.187
They had a four-star general coming in for review.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.978
And they invited me to come meet with them at Dunkin' because they wanted some faculty there.

18:27.680 --> 18:34.054
So I had welded five stars on this thing that hung in front of my American flag tie.

18:34.034 --> 18:47.913
And I had my coat covered up and so I was right there with all of them in the dignitary thing right next to the four-star general and then the corps was marching by like that and so I opened up my corps and the students were all going .

18:51.698 --> 18:56.464
How did you become a corps advisor, corps unit advisor?

18:58.823 --> 19:01.086
I kind of have a knack for getting along with students.

19:02.668 --> 19:06.474
I can sit down in a room with them and I guess it's fake control.

19:06.694 --> 19:08.296
I don't want to have any kind of fake control.

19:09.358 --> 19:11.060
I just will counsel them.

19:11.922 --> 19:12.963
Did they invite you?

19:13.003 --> 19:13.524
Yeah.

19:13.664 --> 19:14.585
No, they invited me.

19:15.827 --> 19:24.139
Like the first or the second year I was here, the Student Senate gave out a Student-Faculty Relationship Award.

19:25.503 --> 19:26.705
And I got it for that year.

19:27.647 --> 19:30.874
And that was Sharp and Riggs and Caperton and that bunch.

19:31.655 --> 19:42.617
And then students in the College of Architecture would gravitate into asking about stuff because I wouldn't tell them what the company would want them to hear.

19:42.867 --> 19:46.892
but how it really happened and what would be best for them.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.757
And so it just happens that way.

19:50.817 --> 19:53.460
How many years, how long did you do that?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.504
Five years with the Corps.

19:56.524 --> 20:04.855
But like right now if anything's happening in the College of Architecture, if a student was pulling a prank or doing something like that, I can find out about it.

20:05.616 --> 20:12.064
None of the other props can because they'll know I won't turn them in and I'll work with them.

20:12.567 --> 20:19.978
Can you give some examples of two or three goofy poems?

20:19.998 --> 20:20.658
Yeah, a good one.

20:22.822 --> 20:37.242
Back in the 70s when I was asking him to do a happening around campus, and one of them would climb up in the old Live Oak and then he would drop poems down in front of people.

20:37.610 --> 20:38.391
you know, by threads.

20:39.052 --> 20:41.516
You know, as people would walk along, all of a sudden there would be a poem there.

20:41.917 --> 20:45.402
They were supposed to be made aware of, you know, the tree and their environment, stuff like that.

20:45.502 --> 20:54.155
And then another one got in a rocking chair and she dressed up with a pose bonnet on over by the MSC and would rock along and then tell tales.

20:55.277 --> 20:59.263
And then the morning everything was supposed to be due, there were

20:59.530 --> 21:04.656
three core guys that hadn't done their thing.

21:05.437 --> 21:09.161
And so finally I called on them and said, could you describe it?

21:09.181 --> 21:11.724
And they said, can we talk to you after class about this?

21:12.825 --> 21:17.791
And they were the ones that had gone and spray painted the lights on Kyle Field, red, white, and blue.

21:19.053 --> 21:27.883
And they had evidently gotten blotted and climbed up with spray paint and painted the American flag on them and then

21:27.863 --> 21:29.686
They went back and passed out in their courtroom.

21:30.107 --> 21:31.870
And so the police came while they were there.

21:32.771 --> 21:35.335
But they were so high up and the police never thought to look high up.

21:35.736 --> 21:36.818
They just looked around the field.

21:37.779 --> 21:39.462
So they got down without breaking their necks.

21:40.985 --> 21:43.990
And so I guess it was Sunday or something.

21:45.673 --> 21:53.145
They woke up and they found out from everybody else in the Corps that the police were searching all the cars going in and off campus for spray cans of paint.

21:53.125 --> 22:05.159
And so they just sort of kept their car on campus for a week and then took it off and dumped all the cans but evidently they had to replace all the lights because they couldn't get them scrubbed off in time to the tune of about 5,000.

22:05.179 --> 22:08.803
And so I've kept that quiet for many years.

22:09.484 --> 22:17.513
Do you know of any planned, goofy, extreme pranks that you or anybody else was able to do?

22:17.813 --> 22:19.757
Yeah, there's another real quick.

22:19.857 --> 22:24.746
One student got arrested for cutting Nandinas under the President's house.

22:25.607 --> 22:29.735
Over there they needed some model trees and a Nandina makes a really good tree at a certain scale.

22:30.396 --> 22:34.383
And evidently he was out there clipping and the police arrested him.

22:34.403 --> 22:39.973
And then another one that was fun, one weekend was... I was wondering, are they finished with the office?

22:42.063 --> 22:43.325
but I'll lock them.

22:47.069 --> 23:10.720
Some of the New Yorkers that were here, this was the second wave of them came, and they couldn't afford to go back home, so they were taking some summer school classes, and so they started, I guess they were part of the skydiving club, so they're out in the Skies Ranch, and some cattle were walking up, and they were all hungry, didn't have anything to eat,

23:10.700 --> 23:12.363
One of them had a .22 in the back.

23:12.403 --> 23:15.108
Ned barred this guy's pickup from the apartment.

23:16.130 --> 23:19.215
And one of the guys from New Jersey, his dad was a butcher.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.699
He said, I know how to butcher one of those.

23:22.641 --> 23:29.974
And so anyhow, they got the .22 out and shot and put it in the back of the pickup and covered it with tarps.

23:30.376 --> 23:51.646
And anyhow, hauled it back to their apartment off of college, took it out, did all the butchering, buried the carcass and everything in the backyard, and then had returned the truck, and it all got in plateau, returned the truck to the apartment, and they didn't wash out the bed.

23:52.047 --> 23:54.190
Well, blood was dripping out of the back of the pickup.

23:54.170 --> 24:03.501
So, you know, a date was coming in and she saw the blood and told her boyfriend and they all, you know, determined it was blood.

24:03.902 --> 24:09.008
So they called the police and the police checked out everything and then went in with drawn guns on the roommate.

24:10.150 --> 24:17.038
And the roommate was going, and he said, now I lent my truck, you know, and I went to bed before they returned it.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.601
and he told them where.

24:19.102 --> 24:26.927
So then they went over to where the party was still going in progress, steaks were frying, and then they arrested all of them for cattle wrestling.

24:28.139 --> 24:30.503
and Manuel Davenport.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.546
Were these architecture students?

24:32.566 --> 24:51.514
All architecture students and Manuel Davenport was on the grand jury at the time fortunately and so anyhow you know all of these Yankees were there just you know because they'd heard of well they hang wrestlers in Texas so somehow Manuel worked out a deal with a rancher

24:51.494 --> 24:54.841
that he would pay whatever the going price was for the cow.

24:55.863 --> 25:01.215
And the rancher said, well I have one other thing that I request because all of them had long hair.

25:02.157 --> 25:08.490
And he said they have to do a core shave, you know, over here on College Main.

25:08.470 --> 25:11.032
And so that was the hardest thing for them to do, but they did.

25:11.052 --> 25:15.676
And then paid him, you know, for the... And that was funny.

25:15.837 --> 25:17.998
But let's see, what was another one that was like?

25:18.139 --> 25:23.343
Oh, they had, when the police were raiding, they saw a big thing of wine that was being bestilled.

25:24.204 --> 25:25.465
But they were all over 21.

25:28.288 --> 25:29.288
But the police didn't say anything.

25:29.308 --> 25:30.750
They thought they'd wait until it was fermented.

25:31.070 --> 25:33.692
Then they would come back and arrest them for running a still.

25:33.953 --> 25:34.373
And they did.

25:34.413 --> 25:36.655
Two weeks later, they came back and arrested them.

25:36.635 --> 25:42.701
But fortunately they couldn't get it passed because they were over 21 and the head of the household, etc.

25:43.081 --> 25:45.503
They didn't have passed the legal thing there.

25:46.024 --> 25:57.314
And then David Suppley, who's in Houston now, he also was about that time from New Jersey and he had really long stringy hair and he looked like David Manson.

25:57.334 --> 25:58.996
And it was the same time as the Manson murders.

25:59.557 --> 26:05.342
Well, he was moving into a spot over on Lake Street right off college.

26:06.689 --> 26:13.079
The next door neighbor saw him and said, you're moving in.

26:13.280 --> 26:13.941
And he said, yeah.

26:14.381 --> 26:15.443
He said, how much are you paying?

26:15.483 --> 26:17.606
He said, I'm paying $50 a month.

26:17.626 --> 26:19.690
He said, I'll give you $100 if you don't move in.

26:22.454 --> 26:23.516
And David thought, OK.

26:24.397 --> 26:28.063
And he took the money and ran and hired in another place.

26:29.405 --> 26:32.410
Some of the students get away with it.

26:32.643 --> 26:40.983
Do you remember any planned pranks that you or somebody heard about that you were able to help prevent?

26:41.806 --> 26:48.542
Well, there's one that just happened a month ago that we didn't actually prevent, we let it go through.

26:48.522 --> 26:53.812
There were three foam statues wired together.

26:53.832 --> 26:59.242
They were student projects and they were stuffed with carpet insulation and stuff.

26:59.903 --> 27:02.688
And they had Mr. Left, Mr. Right, Mr. Middle.

27:03.189 --> 27:10.783
And they were posing and it was an introduction to some presentation for one of the classes.

27:11.472 --> 27:13.594
But they left the three sculptures there.

27:14.135 --> 27:23.744
Well, the graduate class, one of the graduate sections decided, well, they would kidnap Mr. Middle and force the faculty to do penance to bring Mr. Middle back.

27:24.565 --> 27:37.598
So all of us got flyers in our boxes with a guy with a ski mask with a revolver aimed at Mr. Middle's head, saying, if you ever want to see Mr. Middle again, you'll agree to the following da-da-da-da.

27:38.759 --> 27:51.356
And so they had planned for five days on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you know, Monday, Wednesday, that there would be five performances by different faculty members.

27:52.157 --> 28:01.510
The first one was David Woodcock had to recite the Jabberwocky with Andrew Seidel acting in constant.

28:02.317 --> 28:13.920
Then the second one was they gave me freedom and said I could do anything creative I wanted to, but I had to entertain them for X number of minutes.

28:14.782 --> 28:19.110
Then the third one, Dr. Mordell Shepley, who's head of our PhD program,

28:19.090 --> 28:28.359
who is also a modern dancer, she had to dance the Monster Mash in, you know, creative.

28:29.580 --> 28:31.562
And then, let's see, who was next?

28:32.723 --> 28:38.388
Oh, Guillermo Vázquez, who's from Peru, had to recite Green Eggs and Ham in Spanish.

28:39.309 --> 28:47.697
And then the following one, the dean had to recite, he was supposed to yodel the Aggie War Hymn.

28:48.824 --> 28:51.287
And he was a very good support about it.

28:52.989 --> 28:55.853
He went into a history of yodeling, very professorial like.

28:56.594 --> 29:02.061
And then he did try to yodel, which was, I gave him credit for that.

29:02.081 --> 29:04.684
Now these performances were given where?

29:05.045 --> 29:07.888
In the atrium surrounded with students.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.371
And they video recorded all of them.

29:10.471 --> 29:11.693
Midday?

29:12.398 --> 29:13.479
And they recorded all of them.

29:13.499 --> 29:17.144
And the proceeds for the, went for what?

29:17.164 --> 29:18.025
Oh, there was no proceeds.

29:18.045 --> 29:18.846
Oh, I thought you said.

29:18.866 --> 29:19.867
It was to get Mr. Middle back.

29:20.167 --> 29:20.528
Oh, oh, oh.

29:20.548 --> 29:21.068
No sculpture.

29:21.088 --> 29:21.909
Oh, there wasn't any money.

29:22.210 --> 29:22.610
No.

29:23.251 --> 29:24.172
And did he come back?

29:24.312 --> 29:24.873
Oh, yeah.

29:24.893 --> 29:25.393
And in what?

29:25.834 --> 29:26.895
In good shape.

29:26.995 --> 29:27.576
In good shape.

29:27.796 --> 29:28.797
And then what happened to him?

29:29.458 --> 29:30.039
No, he's still there.

29:30.299 --> 29:31.060
Oh, oh, okay.

29:32.021 --> 29:34.985
But it was just, I think they want to do it yearly now.

29:35.005 --> 29:36.887
They'll kidnap something.

29:36.867 --> 29:44.556
Were there any playing stunts, pranks that you heard of that you or somebody were able to get stopped?

29:44.776 --> 29:45.978
Well some I didn't get stopped.

29:46.058 --> 30:04.900
Like one of the students I heard at the end of the semester were sacrificing their projects to the gods and they would go up on the fourth floor of the architecture building after their project was graded and then they would see how far it would sail, you know, to the grassy spot and sling it out like a frisbee.

30:04.880 --> 30:11.749
And so one of the students got up there and decided his wasn't going to sail at all, but he'd burn it instead.

30:12.370 --> 30:21.181
And so it was on a metal area, but somebody about oceanography happened to be in their office and looked down and saw a fire starting and phoned the police.

30:21.782 --> 30:26.528
Well, the police came running up to the fourth floor, you know, and handcuffed the guy and, you know, ran him off.

30:27.910 --> 30:28.491
So...

30:28.471 --> 30:30.894
See, I'm trying to think.

30:31.335 --> 30:33.397
I'll have to think about stopping some.

30:33.517 --> 30:37.082
Do you remember anything that any... Most of them I didn't stop.

30:38.283 --> 30:41.447
Any that were mean in nature?

30:43.990 --> 30:46.894
No, most of them weren't creative and good-hearted in nature.

30:46.914 --> 30:49.197
I don't think anybody did really anything mean.

30:49.919 --> 30:52.822
You said no problems with women.

30:53.182 --> 30:57.587
What about as the student body becomes ethnically diverse?

30:57.787 --> 30:58.848
None with students.

30:59.368 --> 31:12.341
What was interesting was we decided to have what we call PAC, Peer Advising Council, and what we would get with juniors and seniors that would counsel incoming minority students.

31:13.782 --> 31:16.365
And we had that going on about

31:16.345 --> 31:17.167
three years.

31:17.388 --> 31:20.595
And then finally, I mean, it was like pulling hen's teeth to get them to come.

31:21.157 --> 31:26.189
And we would bring in speakers, black or Hispanic speakers from around the state that would come in.

31:26.951 --> 31:28.414
And finally, when I
