WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:08.323
Robert Smith's area, so forth and so on. But 
anyway, the capital fund drive is in part a

00:08.343 --> 00:15.930
response to the treatment that we're being 
accorded. It's unfortunate that some years back,

00:17.011 --> 00:32.805
back when I suppose it was sort of the golden era of 
higher education growth in the state when

00:17.011 --> 00:32.805
Connolly was governor, but we created a lot of 
schools that are underutilized, but once

00:17.011 --> 00:32.805
created, They cannot be dismantled. Would you 
comment in that connection on the traditional

00:36.698 --> 00:47.833
Texas A&M versus University of Texas conflict 
over funding and competition generally? That's

00:48.133 --> 00:49.515
an interesting thing. Historically, 
apparently, there was this conflict, and each

00:50.055 --> 01:02.472
college, each university sought to have its own 
graduates in the legislature and all of that. But

01:03.076 --> 01:12.991
there was ushered in, in the last seven or eight 
years, much more of a cooperative effort. For

01:13.091 --> 01:32.560
example, it's not a case of collusion, but it is a 
fact that

01:13.091 --> 01:32.560
UT and A&M consulted with each other over 
admission standards. so as not to end up being

01:33.282 --> 01:38.108
played one against the other.

01:41.253 --> 01:55.291
They

01:41.253 --> 01:55.291
collaborated along with Houston, I guess, in the 
establishment of – I've forgotten exactly what

01:41.253 --> 01:55.291
they're called. They're like outreach centers. 
There's one in San Antonio. Yeah, I know which one.

01:59.977 --> 02:02.040
That's certainly a collaborative effort. In your 
college, you know that Fallon instituted the

02:02.493 --> 02:19.267
practice of the executive committees of the two 
colleges meeting either once a year or twice a

02:02.493 --> 02:19.267
year, one time there and one time here. An exchange 
of faculty has been utilized. What about

02:25.072 --> 02:27.314
collaboration at the legislative level? I can't 
really speak to that, but I think that there I sense

02:32.092 --> 02:33.173
that, yeah. I think there's been a big change in 
that relationship, but I don't really know, you

02:33.313 --> 02:38.298
know. Yeah, well, you remember the big effort to, 
what was it called, when things got really tight,

02:38.618 --> 02:53.533
we got this sort of state-level NSF to provide 
funding, and that was a collaborative effort.

02:53.553 --> 02:54.434
Yeah, that's right. The creation of that. I think 
that's been one of the most significant changes in

02:55.895 --> 02:59.719
the last, whatever. Well, when we got over our 
guilt complex, or our inferiority, not guilt, but

02:59.868 --> 03:16.391
inferiority complex, about being second to them 
or whatever, and everybody started talking about

02:59.868 --> 03:16.391
the two flagship institutions. That's right. 
That is a different perception. That's a good

03:18.254 --> 03:26.806
point, rather than the University of Texas.

03:26.826 --> 03:29.790
And you need to look at the... At the charts on our 
outside funding for research, we rank seventh. We

03:39.858 --> 03:41.240
rank ahead of UT. Of course, there's a little 
cheating going on. And all that money going to ag

03:43.943 --> 03:54.436
from the experiment station stuff and 
engineering experiment, especially ag, kind of

03:43.943 --> 03:54.436
inflates the figures a bit. But it's still 
significant. That's right. And it is much more. We

04:00.753 --> 04:16.232
continue, because image lags behind performance 
by something like a decade or two, we continue, I

04:00.753 --> 04:16.232
suppose, not to be as well recognized nationally 
as we're going to be. But

04:16.893 --> 04:28.667
I recall having a conversation with a New York 
Times reporter when Shelley Glashow was on

04:16.893 --> 04:28.667
campus. and I ended up being the spokesperson 
because everybody else was out of town except the

04:30.217 --> 04:39.446
Chancellor and me, and it was Anson at the time. 
Shelly was on campus and the guy in helicopters

04:40.687 --> 04:48.555
came in from Houston with the press, you know, and 
we were interviewed outside the Koch building.

04:50.938 --> 04:54.982
And the question was asked, you know, what's going 
on here? Almost incredulous, this guy from the New

04:56.243 --> 04:59.346
York Times I was saying, what's happening down 
there? And I said, well, you know, in the beginning

05:05.065 --> 05:26.633
there was the Ivy League, and they were the top 
institutions in the country, and then gradually

05:05.065 --> 05:26.633
great schools developed in the Midwest, like the 
University of Chicago, Michigan, Ohio State,

05:05.065 --> 05:26.633
Wisconsin, and then on over to the West Coast and a 
California assistant at Stanford. And now it's

05:31.845 --> 05:33.287
the South's turn. We can be as good as anybody. Our 
time has arrived.

05:41.701 --> 05:42.282
That's good. That's a good . And the guy said, hmm, 
well, you know, you got a point there. That's good.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.969
That was at a time, of course, when oil was still 
poor. Yes, that does make a difference, boy. But,

05:54.773 --> 06:04.601
you know, here we are now in the Sun Belt, and an area 
that used to be known as the industrial heart of

05:54.773 --> 06:04.601
America is called the Rust Belt. That's right. 
Times have changed. They sure have. Well, what do

06:08.645 --> 06:17.292
you, if you had to reflect on your days at Texas A&M, 
is there any sort of... centrality or theme

06:17.508 --> 06:25.856
or general evaluation you would give that time? I 
think we became a very different institution.

06:30.801 --> 06:46.637
This is not to say that the school of yesteryear was 
not an outstanding one in its way, but I think that

06:30.801 --> 06:46.637
General Rudder didn't think that dog was going to 
hunt. much longer. Here we were sitting on one of

06:48.051 --> 07:03.146
the biggest, certainly maybe the biggest state 
campus in the country, and maybe the biggest

06:48.051 --> 07:03.146
campus in the country, 5,200 acres and a handful of 
students.

07:05.748 --> 07:12.495
And he was astute enough to see that things had to 
change. It was interesting, you know his

07:12.515 --> 07:16.759
strategy, well I guess this has been written But he 
adopted a strategy which economists call the

07:17.347 --> 07:24.076
leading edge concept. He picked two departments 
to make superstars out of. One was economics and

07:29.124 --> 07:32.809
the other was chemistry. He brought in Greenhut 
and

07:32.829 --> 07:39.258
what's his name? Cotton? Not Cotton. The guy he 
brought in brought Cotton in.

07:48.498 --> 07:52.202
He was department head for a long time. He was 
department head for a long time. He was department

07:54.984 --> 07:59.208
head for a long time. He was department head for a 
long time. He was department head for a long time.

08:05.535 --> 08:07.436
He was department head for a long time. He was 
department head for a long time. He was department

08:12.902 --> 08:15.204
head for a long time. He was department head for a 
long time. thought that the institution should be

08:18.198 --> 08:21.001
as large as it became. And had I been the benevolent 
king of this place, it would have stopped at

08:21.462 --> 08:29.931
25,000. Yeah, that's a number I remember jingling 
around. You get all the advantages of scale, and

08:33.775 --> 08:40.543
beyond that you just get trouble.

08:43.949 --> 08:48.836
I think we really did have growing pains because we 
grew so fast. We were frequently short of

08:49.758 --> 08:54.866
classroom space. We pumped a lot of money into 
research. If you look at the numbers, a major part

08:59.052 --> 09:05.943
of the construction on this campus can be 
attributed to research. One of the things that

09:13.430 --> 09:26.942
did, I think, contribute to the

09:13.430 --> 09:26.942
continuance of this phenomenon of the Aggie 
spirit, which in itself I can't really

09:13.430 --> 09:26.942
understand. I can't really understand how it is 
still so strong, but it is. I agree. I wonder how

09:33.088 --> 09:34.389
long that's going to last. I wonder, too. It's 
obviously not what it was when the Corps was so

09:35.390 --> 09:40.394
dominant. But anyway, what I started to say was one 
of the things that probably helped keep this such a

09:43.703 --> 09:53.514
friendly campus was the fact that we never really 
did build massive lecture halls. Classes are

09:55.156 --> 10:00.122
still quite small, relatively speaking, for an 
institution of this size. This size, you're

10:00.142 --> 10:00.903
right. That's one point. And another point that 
Glenn Dowling can give you very good data on is

10:02.484 --> 10:13.677
compared to, I'd say, almost any, if not all, other 
major institutions in the country, We have more

10:14.281 --> 10:24.232
real faculty, and that's not the right word, 
tenured or tenure-track faculty teaching at the

10:14.281 --> 10:24.232
undergraduate level. We take a place, I was 
reading about Southern Illinois, the provost was

10:25.374 --> 10:39.109
quoted a few years ago as saying, God, none of our 
courses at the undergraduate level are taught by

10:25.374 --> 10:39.109
professors.

10:39.129 --> 10:40.271
But that's not true here. No, not at all. So I think 
that's been a very positive thing that has, I

10:43.829 --> 10:55.507
think, enriched the students' experience here. 
Do you think the mothers clubs and the former

10:57.310 --> 11:05.482
students have been an enriching process? I think 
yes. I think yes. I think this place has done a

11:08.046 --> 11:12.773
remarkable job of indoctrination. of both 
students and parents. We have one of the best, and

11:19.155 --> 11:27.366
people tell us this that have gone to other 
schools, that we have the best orientation

11:19.155 --> 11:27.366
program of any. Incidentally, I still hear people 
say how much they enjoyed your program.

11:35.036 --> 11:37.039
I have a story to tell you about that later. But I 
think it's really from the the silver taps, the

11:42.942 --> 11:48.249
muster. Yeah, muster. Fish camp, I think, is doing 
a good job now in picking up some of that

11:49.391 --> 11:58.183
preservation of the spirit and its non-core, and 
that's helped a lot. I think this place, and

11:59.144 --> 12:10.840
another thing that is a phenomenon probably not 
duplicated in many institutions is this is all of

12:12.119 --> 12:18.227
the student organizations under the MSC. MSC, 
yeah. That gives them a leadership and a...

12:22.252 --> 12:26.178
Political forum, great issues, SCONA, all that 
stuff. Somehow or other, you know, I've always

12:26.298 --> 12:41.738
felt, and I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, 
that students who come out of A&M, in a way, have

12:26.298 --> 12:41.738
come out of the real world more so than students who 
come out of a lot of institutions, and that has been

12:26.298 --> 12:41.738
one of the great strengths of the... of the 
graduate in the job market. I think so. A lot of them

12:45.150 --> 12:48.172
have learned a lot about leadership. That's 
right. And, of course, there's this Aggie network

12:50.835 --> 13:01.004
out there that's not just good old boys now, but 
good old girls. Serious stuff. Serious stuff.

13:03.507 --> 13:08.871
Aggies have a reputation for being hardworking 
youngsters. You know, Hyde was involved. back in

13:12.177 --> 13:23.311
the earlier years with the Center for

13:12.177 --> 13:23.311
Management Training, Executive Development. 
Yes, yeah, sure. And businessmen would come to

13:26.596 --> 13:40.193
these programs,

13:26.596 --> 13:40.193
men, mostly men, sometimes a few women, but 
businesspersons who had been on other campuses.

13:41.489 --> 13:43.792
They couldn't believe what they were seeing. They 
couldn't believe the friendliness of the

13:43.812 --> 13:46.175
students. They couldn't believe how clean the 
campus was.

13:52.323 --> 13:54.205
It was an eye-opener for a lot of them. I guess that 
program's still going well, isn't it? I know it was

13:57.710 --> 13:58.851
a few years ago. And who's the new head of, he was in 
that, gosh. Duke Hobbs heads it now. Who was in that

14:07.223 --> 14:09.385
with you when you were running that program? Billy 
Joe Adams. And someone else, let's see, who's now a

14:11.267 --> 14:21.898
head of a department in business, just accepted 
the headship about a year ago, and who I thought was

14:11.267 --> 14:21.898
ready to hang it all up. Oh, Don Elrigal was one that 
came back after being a department head before.

14:27.924 --> 14:29.305
I'm surprised he agreed to do it again. Do it again, 
I know. I think what has happened with Don is he's

14:31.508 --> 14:35.712
made a reputation for himself. He's got some 
highly successful textbooks. I see him out at the

14:39.033 --> 14:41.176
baseball games all the time. You can't keep your 
nose to the grindstone and spend hours at the . Don

14:49.585 --> 14:57.754
never really was too much involved in the 
executive development program, but he was once a

14:49.585 --> 14:57.754
chancellor. Yeah, I know. Yeah. He's a very 
talented guy. Well, let's see. Let's talk very

15:04.675 --> 15:08.240
quickly, sort of a summary statement. Where do we 
go from here, do you think? What do you see

15:09.743 --> 15:14.931
happening in the major thrust or directions of the 
university? I hope we can continue to preserve

15:16.794 --> 15:20.179
this Aggie spirit. I think it gets increasingly 
difficult with the size that we've achieved.

15:29.134 --> 15:31.197
I see the institution.

15:34.315 --> 15:35.917
continuing to get better. I don't see really

15:36.699 --> 15:47.896
dramatic changes of the magnitude that you and I 
have experienced, though. Given the size,

15:47.916 --> 16:00.154
there's an awful lot of inertia

15:47.916 --> 16:00.154
connected with size.

16:01.552 --> 16:08.702
Until the financing situation changes, we don't 
have a lot of room to be innovative. I would like to

16:10.024 --> 16:17.775
see us have someday a full-blown fine arts 
program. But this is going to be something that

16:19.498 --> 16:26.007
doesn't happen overnight. Dogs knocking on the 
door. Yeah, mine does too. You have to get up and go.

16:32.154 --> 16:34.577
Yeah, you got left out of the scene, huh? Okay, now, 
Max, we're writing.

16:39.663 --> 16:40.604
Sit down. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. You're supposed 
to say when I say sit. And you said a moment ago that

16:44.769 --> 16:52.678
probably the image of the A&M will be better 
because images follow by a decade. Yeah, or at

16:52.698 --> 16:54.340
least, yeah. Well, is there anything else you 
would like to add to this? No. And I may call you

17:01.183 --> 17:02.446
along the way. Yeah, feel free to do so. I really 
don't quite get what I'm doing. I'm just going to do

17:07.416 --> 17:09.381
something. Well, I'll close it off.
