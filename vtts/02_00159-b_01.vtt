00:04.064 --> 00:05.565
This was a Mexican couple.

00:07.587 --> 00:09.429
He was an oceanographer.

00:11.832 --> 00:20.240
She was a wood technician, highly skilled in a very narrow discipline.

00:21.181 --> 00:32.772
Anyway, they had been told about us by some previous Mexican students, and they just showed up here with a little

00:33.680 --> 00:38.707
with a young child, a little girl, as I recall, and a suitcase.

00:41.692 --> 00:43.554
It had just come in from Houston on the bus.

00:45.818 --> 00:48.341
And I don't remember the particulars.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.543
My wife would.

00:50.364 --> 00:59.738
They stayed with us a few days, and he had to go off on one of those oceanographic cruises to the Gulf the next week.

01:00.511 --> 01:03.776
leaving the wife and the child here, and she spoke no English.

01:06.279 --> 01:18.798
And I had to go off on a trip to the valley or someplace for a week, and I left my wife, who spoke no Spanish, with this Mexican lady who spoke no English.

01:20.660 --> 01:23.665
It was a delightful experience for the two women.

01:23.745 --> 01:24.706
They got along great.

01:25.207 --> 01:26.569
How, I do not know.

01:27.798 --> 01:32.584
Now what was his hope when he knocked on the front door?

01:33.405 --> 01:49.085
Well, that we would help them get taken in or tell them where to go and what to do, help them get settled, which we did, you know, get a place over in student housing and get fixed up and show them the town.

01:49.385 --> 01:50.667
What did he end up doing?

01:51.389 --> 01:52.610
He took PhD here.

01:53.191 --> 01:53.291
In?

01:54.172 --> 01:55.033
In oceanography.

01:55.894 --> 01:56.515
Okay.

01:56.535 --> 01:58.517
So it didn't have anything to do specifically with your?

01:58.717 --> 01:59.918
Nothing whatsoever.

02:00.940 --> 02:08.608
We had another couple who were Mexican, who came here and we learned of them through some neighbors.

02:09.649 --> 02:12.552
They later became very close friends of ours.

02:13.734 --> 02:18.679
He was not in, he was in pathology, plant pathology.

02:20.043 --> 02:22.646
And we visited them in Mexico three or four times.

02:24.028 --> 02:25.490
Helped them have babies here.

02:26.812 --> 02:32.199
Took them to hospitals and nursed them through birthings of one sort or another.

02:33.541 --> 02:41.150
We had a very good friend from South Africa who was here, worked on a PhD.

02:43.734 --> 02:44.955
That was kind of an experience.

02:44.995 --> 02:49.341
He was a little, he was a procrastinator.

02:50.975 --> 02:55.241
slow, somewhat lethargic, very intelligent.

02:55.261 --> 02:57.343
He was Dr. Richmond's student.

02:58.625 --> 03:03.131
And when he was writing his dissertation, he'd go in with Richmond to go over.

03:03.171 --> 03:06.215
And Richmond was a taskmaster about writing.

03:07.176 --> 03:11.241
And he wouldn't be very patient with him.

03:11.262 --> 03:13.945
And he used to run this fellow out of his office.

03:14.954 --> 03:21.244
And Dion used to come into my office next door and tell me, Richmond won't talk to me anymore, just threw me out.

03:22.025 --> 03:25.310
Help me with this for a while so I can go back to him.

03:26.833 --> 03:39.713
Later, that man was responsible for me receiving an invitation to go to South Africa for a month, sponsored by four or five different cotton organizations.

03:40.672 --> 03:42.735
I wound up spending six weeks over there.

03:43.376 --> 03:44.458
Is he still down there?

03:44.718 --> 03:45.379
He's still there.

03:45.719 --> 03:46.380
He's still there.

03:46.421 --> 03:48.564
That was in 1980.

03:48.844 --> 03:58.018
You see, that led up to me going to South Africa professionally as a visiting professor in 1986.

03:58.038 --> 04:02.765
We went over and I spent almost five years there.

04:03.566 --> 04:04.327
Oh, I didn't know that.

04:04.347 --> 04:05.509
Yeah.

04:05.549 --> 04:08.333
I retired here in January of 1986.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.360
I had it figured out.

04:10.740 --> 04:17.267
They wrote me in 1984, late in 1984, invited me down for three months.

04:18.628 --> 04:20.590
And I simply told them, I can't do that.

04:21.731 --> 04:23.994
My responsibilities here will not allow that.

04:26.316 --> 04:30.520
I wouldn't mind coming for a longer time if we could work something out.

04:31.741 --> 04:33.443
And sure enough, they wanted to do that.

04:33.743 --> 04:35.265
They came here and visited me.

04:36.325 --> 04:37.927
And we agreed, okay.

04:37.947 --> 04:40.529
I went through everything with the administration.

04:41.630 --> 04:46.255
I knew what my minimum age would be, what my retirement date could be.

04:46.295 --> 04:54.404
And I said, okay, if you'll wait 18 months, we will come over for two years.

04:54.424 --> 04:54.744
Fine.

04:56.205 --> 05:02.552
So on January 31st, 1986, I turned in my keys.

05:03.865 --> 05:14.642
On February 14th, we got on the airplane and went to South Africa and spent, I was there lacking about three months of being five years.

05:15.664 --> 05:19.510
The two-year thing kept being extended and extended.

05:20.231 --> 05:22.575
And what were your research tasks over there?

05:23.236 --> 05:25.840
I went over there as a visiting professor.

05:25.940 --> 05:26.841
Oh.

05:26.861 --> 05:31.729
Simply to, primarily, to help them serve as an advisor.

05:32.468 --> 05:36.534
in some areas of the cotton breeding, particularly in the machine harvesting thing.

05:38.397 --> 05:51.015
Well, the man that I went to work with, my primary co-worker there, later, we were very good friends, family-wise and otherwise, he later became very ill and died.

05:52.497 --> 05:57.244
He became so incapacitated that I took over the program, basically.

05:57.950 --> 06:04.099
And then after he died, they asked me to come back for another year just to make a transition and so forth.

06:05.061 --> 06:09.768
Where was their cotton research in terms of its progress compared to?

06:10.449 --> 06:10.930
Way behind.

06:10.970 --> 06:17.981
They were basically 15 years behind.

06:19.844 --> 06:22.067
That's not to say they didn't have competence.

06:22.503 --> 06:23.785
But they didn't have the programs.

06:23.825 --> 06:25.507
They didn't have the materials.

06:25.527 --> 06:27.790
And cotton was not a major crop in South Africa.

06:29.011 --> 06:31.374
Tobacco was their major crop.

06:31.454 --> 06:40.065
To what other nation or nations did they turn for cotton know-how other than the United States?

06:40.686 --> 06:41.026
Israel.

06:42.648 --> 06:43.870
Israel had some good people.

06:45.014 --> 06:47.057
In fact, I met some while I was there.

06:48.279 --> 06:50.923
I used to come down there on visitations.

06:51.564 --> 06:56.811
The fact that you were an American, was that a plus or a minus as you moved around South Africa?

06:59.215 --> 06:59.896
That was a plus.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.868
To some folks, that was kind of a risky time to be there.

07:08.909 --> 07:13.536
I did a lot of traveling in South Africa, much of it by myself.

07:14.157 --> 07:16.299
My wife used to travel with me part of the time.

07:16.659 --> 07:20.303
That was something they allowed me to do and encouraged, in fact.

07:21.924 --> 07:24.126
We never had any problem.

07:24.147 --> 07:28.511
And this is during the, the period of change, wasn't it?

07:28.691 --> 07:32.975
It was just prior to the time that Mandela was released from prison, yeah.

07:32.995 --> 07:33.515
That's what I thought.

07:36.658 --> 07:42.544
And did they have a perception, did they have a perception of Texas A&M?

07:43.688 --> 07:44.689
and what it was?

07:45.190 --> 07:46.991
What did they think Texas A&M was?

07:48.333 --> 07:50.515
Well, we were great American universities.

07:50.535 --> 07:51.636
Oh, okay.

07:51.656 --> 07:52.958
I never sold that short.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.787
That was a great experience and a very, very comfortable transition into retirement.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.610
I didn't have to just cut it off and quit.

08:04.670 --> 08:12.278
I just moved my activities elsewhere and at a lower level of activity and responsibility.

08:13.017 --> 08:26.469
compare the students over there with the students here at the time you, in the 80s?

08:26.489 --> 08:34.736
I would say our students probably were more sophisticated, more advanced in their disciplines.

08:36.698 --> 08:42.703
I knew some of their students over there quite well, and they were Sharpies, but they just didn't have the

08:45.299 --> 08:47.362
the facilities and the people.

08:48.183 --> 08:50.146
How hard working, how diligent were they?

08:51.388 --> 08:53.491
Not like they are here.

08:53.531 --> 08:57.958
The way of, the lifestyle was a bit more relaxed there.

08:57.998 --> 08:59.440
That's one thing we liked about it.

09:00.201 --> 09:01.183
Not much push to it.

09:01.523 --> 09:06.210
Now, when you were there, were almost all of the students white?

09:07.574 --> 09:09.176
Well, I was not at a university.

09:09.416 --> 09:09.956
Oh, you were not?

09:10.076 --> 09:10.397
Oh, come on.

09:10.497 --> 09:11.698
I was at a research station.

09:11.878 --> 09:12.859
All right.

09:12.879 --> 09:13.660
A research center.

09:14.060 --> 09:15.461
The research center, right?

09:15.481 --> 09:15.582
Yeah.

09:15.602 --> 09:19.065
The staff there, were almost all of them white or were there?

09:19.085 --> 09:20.907
Yeah.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.268
And native South Africans?

09:26.151 --> 09:27.112
Yes.

09:29.294 --> 09:34.419
I can't remember any non-Africans on the staff.

09:34.439 --> 09:37.362
And you said you had, during those five years, almost no problems?

09:38.523 --> 09:47.076
Our nearest neighbors were in a black compound about 300 yards across the road from us.

09:47.096 --> 09:52.604
We were at least that far removed from any other housing on the station.

09:53.325 --> 09:58.894
And I'm not going to ask you for the dollars, but the compensation then there compared to here?

09:59.114 --> 10:01.037
I went over there for a salary.

10:02.958 --> 10:06.704
roughly 40% of what I was getting here.

10:07.806 --> 10:11.532
And as far as you knew that was about what the others were getting there?

10:11.572 --> 10:12.754
Yeah, yeah.

10:12.774 --> 10:21.007
So that, all right, was there, did you see a talent drain out of South Africa during that period?

10:21.548 --> 10:25.033
Were some, some of the highly capable people moving out?

10:25.418 --> 10:26.199
Yes.

10:27.040 --> 10:27.541
Yes.

10:27.561 --> 10:28.783
Because of.

10:28.803 --> 10:29.985
Particularly going into your.

10:30.706 --> 10:38.478
Because I have assumed that during the last 20 years a lot of talented South Africans have moved elsewhere.

10:40.240 --> 10:52.118
For example, the man that was here that ended up as the, what, president or chancellor at LSU and I believe a veterinarian came to South Africa.

10:52.098 --> 10:53.699
Can't think of his name right now.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.440
That's right.

10:54.460 --> 10:55.541
There was a vet here.

10:55.601 --> 10:57.082
There was South Africa.

10:57.303 --> 10:57.683
That's true.

10:58.203 --> 11:04.049
And we have two or three friends here we know who are South African.

11:04.089 --> 11:05.390
They've been here for several years now.

11:06.151 --> 11:06.431
Right.

11:06.791 --> 11:13.617
You were naming some graduate students that you remember proudly from your own experience here.

11:16.140 --> 11:19.783
Describe some others that... I had one from, I had a couple from the Philippines.

11:21.705 --> 11:22.105
A woman.

11:23.637 --> 11:37.880
and a man, both of whom were very good students, good workers, and we developed quite a friendship other than just, you know, the student-prof relationship.

11:37.900 --> 11:45.292
As it turns out, both of those people now are back in the States working in professional positions.

11:46.274 --> 11:47.195
Back in the U.S.?

11:47.215 --> 11:47.495
Yeah.

11:48.397 --> 11:50.320
One of them is with

11:52.662 --> 11:57.009
with a state agency in San Diego and employment.

11:58.472 --> 11:59.433
I've forgotten the name of it.

12:00.515 --> 12:01.457
She's doing quite well.

12:02.599 --> 12:18.045
The boy, who was one of the sharpest ones I ever had, now is an extension plant, no, extension horticulturist with the Texas Agricultural Extension Service in El Paso.

12:21.063 --> 12:27.008
Had those two from Mexico, had a good student from Egypt.

12:28.790 --> 12:34.995
In those days, we had some good students come out of the Middle East, Egypt, Iran, Iraq.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.639
Some of those were Cracker Jacks.

12:41.941 --> 12:49.348
They had some real deficiencies in attitude, particularly in respect to the way they worked.

12:49.733 --> 12:50.894
Describe that.

12:51.535 --> 13:01.606
I can remember this one of them from Egypt who had a pretty responsible post in the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture.

13:02.548 --> 13:11.958
And he had a research project out here which involved field work in the field, making crosses and things.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.163
And I remember him telling me one day,

13:17.003 --> 13:26.032
how tough it was to work here and how uncomfortable he was with it because he had no one to hold an umbrella for him.

13:26.793 --> 13:29.996
He had no boy to send for a drink of water.

13:30.597 --> 13:36.944
He had to do it for himself, and at home he would never do things like that.

13:36.964 --> 13:38.545
He had problems.

13:40.968 --> 13:46.133
We had, at that time, Beasley Laboratory, which is a greenhouse facility

13:46.788 --> 13:51.692
across from the biochemistry building, that middle one there.

13:53.254 --> 13:58.599
And I had an officer at one time and some of the graduate students' office there.

13:59.340 --> 14:08.288
And this, when we planted in the spring with some of the genetic material, we had to put out as transplants.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.910
You didn't seed them because you didn't have them.

14:10.930 --> 14:16.255
So everybody, anybody you could lay hands on had to go help

14:16.606 --> 14:17.367
transplant.

14:18.668 --> 14:19.909
And Sammy didn't show up.

14:21.330 --> 14:22.892
He didn't show up the next day.

14:23.732 --> 14:27.255
And I remember Richman told him, man, you better be here tomorrow.

14:27.295 --> 14:28.176
He didn't show up.

14:28.777 --> 14:31.419
Richman went down, got his books, and threw them out in the street.

14:35.102 --> 14:36.223
He had to get his attention.

14:36.483 --> 14:38.205
Did he show up the next day?

14:38.225 --> 14:38.625
Oh, yeah.

14:40.107 --> 14:41.908
And I can remember another one we had.

14:42.028 --> 14:45.111
That boy was from

14:46.070 --> 14:47.432
It ran, as I recall.

14:48.032 --> 14:48.773
We were planting.

14:50.876 --> 14:53.839
And we were rather primitive in those days.

14:53.919 --> 15:01.488
We used a tractor to open a furrow, then we'd come along by hand and dribble the seed to him, because the seeds were scarce.

15:02.889 --> 15:05.252
And Dr. Richmond was driving the tractor.

15:05.312 --> 15:06.614
He loved to do that.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.257
And we'd have people planting, you know.

15:11.019 --> 15:15.604
And one of these boys was not paying attention, and I remember Richmond standing up

15:15.888 --> 15:23.821
in the seat of the tractor and hollering at him, better get your ass out of the way, I'm going to run over you.

15:23.841 --> 15:27.167
Temper's got a little short doing this, you know.

15:27.187 --> 15:31.234
Those are some of the anecdotes which are not particularly pleasant to think about.

15:31.254 --> 15:38.586
This other one was the time we had a crew of black women hand harvesting in those days.

15:38.607 --> 15:41.271
This probably was in the early 60s.

15:43.293 --> 15:47.219
And sometimes they'd get a little fractious.

15:47.239 --> 15:52.686
And we had one who was a troublemaker.

15:52.707 --> 15:54.529
And I had them down there working with them.

15:54.549 --> 15:56.272
We were harvesting.

15:56.292 --> 16:02.961
And she got to agitating and one of them wanted the crew to strike for more money.

16:03.782 --> 16:05.305
She agitated all these old women.

16:05.705 --> 16:07.167
Now, were these local residents?

16:07.628 --> 16:08.008
Yeah.

16:08.069 --> 16:08.689
These black ladies?

16:08.709 --> 16:09.451
Yeah, out of the black.

16:09.931 --> 16:11.173
Out of the black.

16:11.828 --> 16:14.091
And I don't remember that woman's name.

16:14.871 --> 16:16.413
Boy, she was stirring things up.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.155
And Richmond came to see what was going on.

16:19.357 --> 16:22.520
And I was working catty-cornered across the field from him.

16:23.641 --> 16:26.625
And I told him what was happening, and this woman's stirring things up.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.169
Richmond had, at times, his fuse was pretty short.

16:31.731 --> 16:34.714
And he had an old black Pontiac car.

16:36.297 --> 16:41.684
that had been assigned to him by the Texas Planting Seed Association.

16:42.025 --> 16:43.687
That's something else.

16:43.707 --> 16:46.371
And he got mad, and he said, get in here.

16:46.431 --> 16:47.812
We're going to straighten this out.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.337
And he didn't go down the turn row and up.

16:51.357 --> 16:56.985
He went catty-cornered across that field, just like this, whoop, over the rows.

16:58.687 --> 17:00.329
And I'm hanging on for dear life.

17:01.010 --> 17:05.376
I didn't know whether to be amused or frightened.

17:07.229 --> 17:09.933
That's just something that happened many years ago.

17:11.755 --> 17:19.646
One of the most pleasant things I can recall in Haskell was when we worked with youngsters.

17:21.308 --> 17:29.018
In those days, we did lots of hand work, and it was not unusual for us to have

17:29.656 --> 17:36.409
20, 24 kids in the summertime for pollinating and were helping us in the field.

17:36.650 --> 17:37.872
And we're talking about high school age?

17:37.912 --> 17:38.674
High school age.

17:38.734 --> 17:41.900
At that time, we could hire them at 14.

17:42.902 --> 17:45.146
Basically, we were supposed to be 15 or 16.

17:46.409 --> 17:49.555
And some of those kids had never hit a lick in their life.

17:49.940 --> 17:51.542
was their first job.

17:52.643 --> 17:54.685
And it was not, it was not easy.

17:55.286 --> 17:59.991
Working in the sun, bent over a cotton plant like that four or five hours a day, you know.

18:01.132 --> 18:06.358
And some of those kids have turned out to be really super people.

18:06.999 --> 18:10.723
Doctors, administrators, tradespeople.

18:10.983 --> 18:12.404
Where did you all find these youngsters?

18:13.486 --> 18:17.550
Out of A&M Consolidated High School, primarily.

18:18.003 --> 18:21.326
Did you send a letter over there or just ask for?

18:21.466 --> 18:23.048
Just by word of mouth.

18:23.068 --> 18:23.589
Oh, okay.

18:23.609 --> 18:24.730
They showed up.

18:24.750 --> 18:24.850
Okay.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.051
Okay.

18:26.071 --> 18:26.672
Oh, that's good.

18:26.792 --> 18:27.372
That's good.

18:27.552 --> 18:28.213
That was great.

18:28.654 --> 18:44.970
Now, in dealing with these young men and women, I presume on some occasions from all over the world, did you all ever see any evidences of their regional rivalries brought here?

18:46.131 --> 18:47.352
Give us some examples.

18:48.310 --> 18:52.074
We had a young fellow from Australia who was doing graduate work here.

18:53.135 --> 18:54.156
That was in 1967.

18:56.578 --> 19:00.402
We had that Egyptian here at the same time.

19:00.542 --> 19:05.748
I believe that was the year when they had the big Israeli-Egyptian war.

19:07.069 --> 19:13.856
And wow, this Australian was a right winger, you know, great for Brits.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.938
And he and the Egyptian

19:16.323 --> 19:19.410
They used to go at it verbally all the time.

19:21.796 --> 19:30.636
As far as you are aware, did any of those international students have any problems living in College Station, College Station Bryan?

19:33.265 --> 19:34.266
Adapting, yeah.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.852
But, I mean, were they mistreated by local people?

19:37.872 --> 19:38.993
To my knowledge, no.

19:39.013 --> 19:40.335
All right, because I haven't heard of them.

19:40.355 --> 19:45.923
I never have, never heard one complain about it.

19:46.043 --> 19:59.662
Did you ever run into any awkwardness in terms of their religious practices and or their attitudes of what was or was not to be done?

20:00.884 --> 20:02.867
Only in respect to

20:04.113 --> 20:07.197
Probably the one that stands out would be their dietary.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.099
What they could eat and couldn't eat?

20:09.119 --> 20:09.359
Yeah.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.261
And we used to kid them a good bit.

20:11.522 --> 20:14.145
We used to have barbecues and we'd go with things like that.

20:14.665 --> 20:19.791
We had to be rather careful, and most of them took it with a grain of salt, no problem at all.

20:20.412 --> 20:21.453
We respected that.

20:21.534 --> 20:27.180
We might kid them about it, but nothing serious ever came of that.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.424
And almost all of them were thoroughly, thoroughly fluent in English.

20:32.902 --> 20:35.285
Most, yes.

20:36.166 --> 20:44.476
We had some come in here who had to go through the English Language Institute before they could be qualified.

20:45.477 --> 20:54.188
We had a fellow come in here one time from Pakistan we had a lot of trouble with because of his English and some attitude problems.

20:55.389 --> 21:00.816
We had another one come in here from, where was he from?

21:04.407 --> 21:06.831
What's the country right next to Pakistan?

21:07.632 --> 21:08.433
Bangladesh?

21:08.513 --> 21:09.034
No.

21:09.575 --> 21:10.136
Afghanistan?

21:10.156 --> 21:10.997
Afghanistan.

21:12.219 --> 21:15.584
We had a lot of trouble with him, language-wise.

21:15.624 --> 21:17.246
He didn't last.

21:17.266 --> 21:19.329
He just couldn't act.

21:19.349 --> 21:25.999
We had good students come out of Southeast Asia, out of Thailand particularly, some very good ones.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.002
They haven't mentioned anybody from Europe.

21:29.213 --> 21:30.775
We didn't get many Europeans.

21:30.895 --> 21:32.717
Because cotton isn't a European crop, is it?

21:33.278 --> 21:34.239
No, no.

21:35.140 --> 21:43.791
And that's what drew them in here, because we did have the expertise in almost any aspect of cotton production.

21:43.811 --> 21:47.957
During your 1950, what year you're on?

21:48.738 --> 21:49.018
53.

21:49.038 --> 21:50.840
53 to 86?

21:50.860 --> 21:52.943
86.

21:53.378 --> 21:58.584
in terms of the research on cotton.

21:59.686 --> 22:04.652
Did the importance of the cotton research remain at the same level?

22:04.752 --> 22:12.061
Did it increase, decrease, or what in that 30 years plus?

22:16.126 --> 22:23.115
Well, the importance, you mean in its relative importance in the experiment station program?

22:23.467 --> 22:34.000
probably overall decreased, particularly in the later years.

22:34.461 --> 22:34.921
Very much.

22:34.981 --> 22:36.704
In recent years, let me put it that way.

22:37.324 --> 22:39.767
Very much or a whole lot?

22:40.088 --> 22:52.984
Well, the advent probably, the vibes I get when I speak with people and visit now, this whole picture of biotechnology has really

22:53.437 --> 23:02.628
eaten into the support both financially and administratively for applied programs in agriculture.

23:03.330 --> 23:05.016
So cotton has suffered that.

23:05.317 --> 23:10.623
Smaller grades, almost any crop.

23:10.843 --> 23:24.920
During those three decades plus, go back and review who the department heads from the 70s, who was in agronomy?

23:24.960 --> 23:27.123
Well, it was Adams when I came here.

23:27.323 --> 23:27.483
Yeah.

23:29.746 --> 23:31.788
Johnny Rogers.

23:31.808 --> 23:33.450
I think he succeeded Adams.

23:35.033 --> 23:39.098
Then Morris Bloodworth, Ed Runge.

23:40.079 --> 23:40.940
R-U-N-G-E?

23:41.381 --> 23:42.021
R-U-N-G-E.

23:43.183 --> 23:44.925
He retired a year and a half ago.

23:45.585 --> 23:46.226
Oh, so, okay.

23:46.587 --> 23:48.088
He was from University of Missouri.

23:49.650 --> 23:56.198
And they just, just within the last month, decided on their new department head.

23:56.498 --> 24:09.643
Now, during all those years, there sometimes were arguments at the higher administrative levels about whether the Experiment Station Extension Service ought to report to the campus or to the system.

24:10.364 --> 24:13.470
Did those arguments affect those of you at the working level?

24:14.833 --> 24:14.973
No.

24:15.134 --> 24:17.558
Not me, anyway.

24:17.618 --> 24:18.540
I was never affected.

24:21.963 --> 24:36.007
As you look back over those 30 years, describe some special moments when you felt very proud and successful, happy.

24:37.329 --> 24:41.917
Some discovery y'all made, some peak you reached.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.203
You mean in my work?

24:50.887 --> 24:52.108
Oh, goodness.

24:52.128 --> 24:54.050
I don't know what to brag on.

24:54.210 --> 24:55.912
Don't have much to brag on.

24:56.532 --> 25:02.938
When something y'all were hoping to find out to Discovery to approve, when you did?

25:06.061 --> 25:12.627
When you turned in a report to some funding source?

25:16.190 --> 25:16.551
All right.

25:16.651 --> 25:18.953
Probably the one thing that has had

25:20.890 --> 25:36.975
A significant practical impact on Texas agriculture was the research that we did, and I say we, this involved Knox Walker, Luther Byrd.

25:39.519 --> 25:47.792
We were the main, I would say, the principal leaders in the development and

25:48.650 --> 26:18.657
elaboration of practical short-season production systems for cotton as a means of, first of all, minimizing problems with the bo weevil, secondly, the reduction of chemical pesticides, the optimum use of

26:19.683 --> 26:43.133
of rainfall periods, optimum growing periods, harvestability, and that was translated into, I think, ultimately, into improved income on an acre basis for producers.

26:43.153 --> 26:46.517
This was a tough nut to crack for the simple reason that

26:47.780 --> 27:08.067
The mentality of producing big crops, high yields, used to be very important, particularly in places like the Brazos Bottom or the lower Rio Grande Valley or the Coastal Bend or the irrigated areas out west of San Antonio and so forth.

27:10.949 --> 27:39.657
The attempt to educate people that that is not an economically feasible way of producing cotton, it took years of conditioning before people began to recognize that, hey, I can grow one of these short season types, put it in, have it set its fruit, quit setting its fruit, mature it, and I'm out of the field in 120 days instead of 180.

27:41.257 --> 27:42.579
and make just as much money.

27:44.822 --> 28:01.023
That probably, in an overall applied way, is perhaps the best bit of work I did in 33 years.

28:01.043 --> 28:09.154
And the sources of information necessary to bring that about

28:11.007 --> 28:14.855
There were cotton varieties from other parts of the world?

28:17.441 --> 28:18.965
Mainly some of our own.

28:19.005 --> 28:21.270
Okay.

28:21.470 --> 28:27.784
Some from our own cotton belt, of course, because

28:29.890 --> 28:43.264
the movement into this so-called short season idea, and that is defined differently by different people, caught hold in the commercial industry.

28:43.324 --> 28:52.454
So they began to produce crops that are much more precocious, that didn't take six months to mature and harvest.

28:53.374 --> 28:56.758
So we had a lot of material that we could use

28:57.430 --> 29:05.543
The key was taking those and managing them to fit our ideal.

29:05.563 --> 29:09.108
That's where we really scored, I think.

29:09.128 --> 29:19.084
I can remember working in the nether regions down below Del Rio, across some of the Rio Grande River, the end of civilization.

29:19.785 --> 29:24.653
And that's where we began to get some concrete proof

29:25.628 --> 29:27.831
that this idea really had merit.

29:29.934 --> 29:38.106
Probably the bigger job was educating producers that, hey, this is a viable way of producing a crop.

29:38.126 --> 29:40.990
Why wouldn't they have bought into it without any?

29:41.150 --> 29:41.571
Risky.

29:42.372 --> 29:43.193
Oh.

29:43.213 --> 29:44.555
Oh, no, I can't see.

29:44.956 --> 29:51.906
How can you tell me I can produce a crop in 120, 130 days and make as much money

29:52.713 --> 29:53.835
Oh, no.

29:53.855 --> 29:55.858
Besides that, it's not good for my ego.

29:57.300 --> 29:57.581
All right.

29:57.841 --> 30:04.091
Now, that crop then, instead of being harvested in September and October... We'd be out in September.

30:04.351 --> 30:06.414
They'd harvest it in July and August?

30:06.995 --> 30:08.998
Well, let's say in the rise and the bottom.

30:09.038 --> 30:10.280
You could plant in April.

30:11.322 --> 30:15.007
You would be harvesting late August, early September.

30:15.288 --> 30:16.550
Okay.

30:16.570 --> 30:19.294
I remember back in the days when we were glad

30:20.185 --> 30:23.048
We were pleased to be out of the field by Thanksgiving.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.950
Yes, yes.

30:24.970 --> 30:27.914
That's almost unheard of now.

30:27.934 --> 30:44.893
All right, now, and as a result of that work and lots of other work that you all did, cotton geographic, the cotton growing area geographically moved west and south in Texas, do it not?

30:46.274 --> 30:47.696
It had already done that anyway.

30:47.716 --> 30:48.357
Oh, it already had?

30:48.417 --> 30:48.597
Yeah.

30:48.797 --> 30:51.000
Okay.

30:52.281 --> 30:58.509
Since the 50s, has cotton acreage in Texas diminished, total acreage?

30:59.470 --> 31:00.071
It does this.

31:00.231 --> 31:01.112
It's up and down.

31:01.273 --> 31:06.599
I would say overall, probably been a general loss in acreage.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.922
What about in bales?

31:10.424 --> 31:14.509
We still produce in Texas about, I'm guessing,

31:16.902 --> 31:18.725
About 40% of the national crop.

31:20.367 --> 31:22.831
Who, is there anybody else anywhere close?

31:23.812 --> 31:24.413
California.

31:25.014 --> 31:25.354
Oh.

31:25.374 --> 31:25.935
Mississippi.

31:26.456 --> 31:26.796
Okay.

31:28.439 --> 31:29.761
Those would be the other major ones.

31:31.183 --> 31:39.014
And the acreage per producer, I presume, has gone up.

31:39.074 --> 31:39.855
Gone up.
