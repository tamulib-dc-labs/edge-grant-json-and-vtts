WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:06.308
I've got to come up with his name right now very well.

00:06.328 --> 00:12.095
He's long since dead, but... Okay, so let's continue.

00:12.756 --> 00:18.522
So this farmer, the reason he was convinced... He's allowing you to use his equipment, okay.

00:18.542 --> 00:26.130
And I think the reason that we gained his confidence, he used to see us working on Sundays and Saturdays when no one else was working.

00:26.711 --> 00:26.811
Yeah.

00:26.831 --> 00:32.097
And finally, one day the second year, first year we just...

00:32.954 --> 00:35.737
scratched it in ourself.

00:35.757 --> 00:39.361
And by 47, he came over one Sunday afternoon.

00:39.801 --> 00:44.286
He drove by in his old pickup and he came in and he said, I see lots of activity over here.

00:44.306 --> 00:49.672
And by then I got so I could say half sentences, make myself understood.

00:49.712 --> 00:56.700
And he said, I see that you people are pretty serious about this business.

00:58.182 --> 01:02.286
And he says, please show me what's going on here.

01:02.823 --> 01:03.764
This was in 47.

01:04.325 --> 01:07.749
November 47?

01:07.809 --> 01:09.531
No, it was 46.

01:09.571 --> 01:18.683
No, we had planned.

01:19.003 --> 01:24.510
He had already sent over the machinery to plant.

01:25.385 --> 01:28.850
the person in charge of the experiment station knew him also.

01:29.171 --> 01:34.359
And so he had condescended to do this, but he had never really come and looked at things before.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.163
This was in April of 47.

01:38.265 --> 01:41.930
And from then on, he always came by and he continued to help us.

01:42.391 --> 01:54.109
And so when Aureliano Campoy was his name, A-U-R-E-L-I-A-M-O, Campoy, C-A-M-P-O-Y,

01:54.460 --> 02:00.230
And so from that day on, he helped us.

02:01.512 --> 02:04.176
I think he knew that he would benefit too.

02:04.617 --> 02:09.024
And then there's another person I need to wave into this.

02:09.826 --> 02:11.989
When I was miserable up there, I'd go up.

02:12.009 --> 02:14.173
We had to cook our own food.

02:14.491 --> 02:20.858
Of course, my old forest service days used to help me a great deal, and I'd cook for these two young people that I used to take up with me.

02:22.960 --> 02:37.376
First, you had to shovel out this old miserable house and clean it up, and I cooked the food, but I didn't have any vehicle to go into town to buy provisions.

02:38.297 --> 02:43.823
Sometimes this farmer would come by, but it soon worked out that there was an elderly widow,

02:44.292 --> 02:48.559
Mrs. Jones, just across, half a mile away.

02:49.560 --> 02:53.947
And she had seen us and found out who we were.

02:55.510 --> 03:02.841
And so she started coming by and she would, on Saturday morning, she said, come on, we'll go into town and buy groceries.

03:03.074 --> 03:17.091
So every, in the period say from mid-January until when we finished that season up there in May, sometimes I would go back once during that period to see what was going on at one of the other experiment stations.

03:17.371 --> 03:20.055
But you'd stay up at Obergon that whole time?

03:20.075 --> 03:28.265
Generally make one trip for a few days to see what was going on in the experiment station in Central Mexico and in Chopinco.

03:28.685 --> 03:31.849
But stay there other than that.

03:32.167 --> 03:33.851
So I'd go with her every Saturday.

03:34.432 --> 03:40.365
And then every Sunday night, she started inviting us over for cake at her home.

03:40.385 --> 03:42.148
And she had an interesting background.

03:42.168 --> 03:44.754
She was born in Connecticut.

03:44.774 --> 03:51.829
And her husband-to-be, she had known when they were young

03:52.636 --> 03:57.663
And he was sold some land there by a pretty strong promotional development company.

03:57.703 --> 04:05.795
There were pictures of this land, irrigated land that was put on by railroad.

04:06.016 --> 04:11.864
This is a promotional thing showing where the water takeoff was from the canal.

04:12.606 --> 04:14.068
Hell, it was just a fake picture.

04:14.608 --> 04:15.950
There wasn't any canal there.

04:16.531 --> 04:17.833
But they were sold this land.

04:18.574 --> 04:20.317
Of course, it was a pretty reasonable price.

04:20.958 --> 04:22.440
But they came down there.

04:23.990 --> 04:38.411
Just very shortly after, I can't put my finger on the years, I'd have to go back to my old notebooks, but it was in the early period before the revolution.

04:38.431 --> 04:39.793
My goodness.

04:39.814 --> 04:47.345
In other words, before 1910, when there were Indian wars and every other thing going on around there, you'd carry a gun when you- Yeah, that's perfect.

04:47.365 --> 04:52.933
And when the water would come in the rivers, they would trap some of it and plant rice and then

04:53.791 --> 04:58.037
put up a few borders high once and capture water and let it sink in and plant wheat.

04:59.159 --> 05:00.661
She went through all of that.

05:00.681 --> 05:02.724
Her husband had long since died.

05:03.685 --> 05:06.048
But they were respected citizens there.

05:06.989 --> 05:10.835
And I knew her son and two daughters, both.

05:13.258 --> 05:15.461
None of them were working on the farm.

05:16.743 --> 05:20.829
And they all sooner or later moved back to the U.S., but she died there.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.072
And she used to help me a great deal.

05:23.896 --> 05:34.215
Going back to this other person, by 48, I organized there, and we were developing this in the other parts of Mexico, too.

05:34.235 --> 05:44.875
How the hell I did it in so many places beyond me with poorly trained people, but by that

05:45.209 --> 05:50.835
Year 48, I had the first plots planted, as well as all kinds of experimental things.

05:51.055 --> 06:05.109
Big program by then, and I'd been joined by Dr. Joe Rupert, who came to our program after he came out of the Army, probably in 40—I suppose he came in 46.

06:06.150 --> 06:10.515
He was also a forester from Minnesota, from up on the range.

06:10.675 --> 06:14.659
He grew up in Everlitt.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.344
After he graduated in forestry, he was a year behind me.

06:17.404 --> 06:24.011
He went to Michigan State and studied plant pathology for a master's on potatoes.

06:24.571 --> 06:26.874
Then he went to West Virginia and did his doctor.

06:28.535 --> 06:34.501
He did his thesis, though, in Mexico with us on wheat and presented it at West Virginia.

06:34.721 --> 06:36.483
He was a tremendous hard worker.

06:37.204 --> 06:41.828
Later moved on to the wheat program as director of the wheat program in Colombia and Chile.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.870
Moved back

06:44.795 --> 06:57.676
in about 1977 to Davis, California, and to Corvallis, and started this spring winter cross.

06:58.237 --> 07:07.271
Unfortunately, he died from acute leukemia, only sick about two weeks, and we rubbed him out.

07:07.291 --> 07:11.578
But he was a very constructive guy, so he and I were up there.

07:12.554 --> 07:15.177
These plots were beautiful.

07:16.138 --> 07:26.488
We thought it was time to organize a farmer's field day to get the rest of the people involved, to win back some... So this is three and a half years after the first experiments, is that right?

07:27.108 --> 07:32.254
Forty-five to forty-eight... Is that about three and a half years after?

07:32.274 --> 07:32.434
Yeah.

07:32.454 --> 07:33.615
Okay.

07:33.635 --> 07:40.602
And which would mean... Three years, three years, but... Which would mean, was this the seventh crop then?

07:40.622 --> 07:41.683
Yes.

07:42.068 --> 07:42.528
Okay.

07:43.830 --> 07:47.393
And so I had three or four of these in small plots.

07:48.294 --> 07:48.394
Okay.

07:48.414 --> 07:51.157
And I organized a field day, and I held it on Sunday.

07:52.298 --> 07:55.101
I thought maybe I could get some of the people to come then.

07:55.521 --> 08:04.190
I spent a couple of days, I rode in with Mrs. Jones, and in my own awkwardness, and with the director who was afraid, really, of the farmers.

08:06.032 --> 08:10.236
I went to the government office to control agricultural credits

08:11.060 --> 08:12.882
various government agencies.

08:13.804 --> 08:15.426
And I said, we're going to hold this field day.

08:15.446 --> 08:18.249
It's going to be such and such an hour on a Sunday.

08:19.331 --> 08:20.893
This was when the grain was ripening.

08:21.714 --> 08:22.975
We're going to have a barbecue.

08:23.376 --> 08:25.399
We're going to have beer, free.

08:27.201 --> 08:28.483
Where'd you get the funds for this?

08:29.103 --> 08:32.187
Artify budget, weight budget.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.830
We had this flexibility.

08:33.850 --> 08:39.297
You mean you could afford to do something like that and you couldn't afford transportation?

08:39.317 --> 08:40.358
We couldn't get the vehicles.

08:40.709 --> 08:42.852
Oh.

08:42.872 --> 08:43.473
Why not?

08:43.493 --> 08:53.308
And by then we had vehicles back in Mexico, but they used to take seven to eight days driving out through the desert and crossing and fording rivers.

08:53.348 --> 08:54.289
There were no roads.

08:56.012 --> 09:09.291
And as a matter of fact, this 48, when I knew we were going to harvest this plot and we didn't have anything except improvised thrashing machines before that were miserable, I had finally bought one in the US and it came to Mexico.

09:09.351 --> 09:10.513
I put it on this truck.

09:11.675 --> 09:39.387
We had those war tires that blew out every little bit and I took a pickup and we had that Chevrolet truck with this Pullman nursery trasher for thrashing the yield plots and all of the bags, paper bags for harvesting and tags and so on.

09:40.818 --> 09:44.964
And I figured I couldn't get through across the rivers along the West Coast.

09:45.204 --> 09:52.715
Pan American Highway haven't been built yet, except the northernmost part down to Hermesil.

09:52.735 --> 09:56.680
And so, but you could drive to El Paso.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.025
So, I went that way and I checked.

10:00.562 --> 10:06.852
with the American Embassy that I would be able to go through there and back into Mexico without difficulties.

10:06.892 --> 10:13.041
Hell, I got to the border and I got into the worst mess I've ever seen on customs regulations.

10:14.663 --> 10:25.540
I said, you can't bring this out, you can't show a certificate that it was produced in the USA, so it's probably illegally importing this through the USA and you may resell it.

10:26.448 --> 10:35.717
even though it was stamped all over there, Bill's Welding, Pullman, Washington, and the tires were US made, the whole gamut of things, but this is the bureaucracy.

10:36.218 --> 10:47.489
I spent all one afternoon, my liver and heart and the rest of the internal organs was ready to explode with this bureaucracy.

10:48.990 --> 10:51.032
Couldn't work it out.

10:51.052 --> 10:54.936
Next morning I went back again and I was curious.

10:56.772 --> 11:10.748
And finally, they condescended to let me ship it in bond and drive the truck, ourself, back to Nogales, Sonora, or Nogales, Arizona, and into Mexico.

11:10.788 --> 11:18.737
Then we would have to take the trashing machine, the extra tires, and the bags, and all of the other things we had to have for harvest.

11:20.139 --> 11:22.341
And then, to make it worse,

11:22.827 --> 11:25.049
When it was trans-ship, we got to Nogales.

11:25.070 --> 11:26.051
Rupert was with me.

11:26.151 --> 11:32.598
He was driving, or he was—I had a driver for the truck.

11:32.618 --> 11:37.123
We waited two days in Nogales, and it never showed up.

11:37.143 --> 11:39.045
Somebody misshipped it to California.

11:39.926 --> 11:42.870
So, we had to put a tracer on it, and finally it got there.

11:43.390 --> 11:46.894
By then I was ready to have a stroll.

11:47.262 --> 11:54.691
I talked to the customs person in Nogales, and he said, you should never have been put through this miserable treatment they've given you.

11:56.413 --> 12:02.681
What they told us, what you were told in the embassy, American embassy in Mexico, was correct.

12:03.402 --> 12:09.169
But the new customs officer there was throwing the book at you.

12:09.419 --> 12:15.948
Because he was covering his tracks, he had been in trouble on another place where he had let something go through that shouldn't have gone through.

12:16.529 --> 12:20.054
So he was putting all kinds of things in front of him.

12:20.074 --> 12:23.339
So he went down, and that's when everything was beautiful.

12:24.281 --> 12:27.726
We were there getting close to harvest.

12:27.786 --> 12:32.713
I set up the field day, and I was hopeful I'd get fair turnout.

12:32.733 --> 12:35.557
All we got is about 25 people.

12:36.078 --> 12:37.740
Only five of them were farmers.

12:37.940 --> 12:39.122
The rest were bureaucrats.

12:39.963 --> 12:40.924
government people.

12:40.944 --> 12:42.466
Why do you think the turnout was so poor?

12:44.188 --> 12:45.729
I didn't believe anything was happening.

12:47.191 --> 12:53.338
We hadn't had any publicity, except these few people right next door, neighbors that had seen it.

12:53.358 --> 13:09.295
But there was one young engineer, graduate from Chipingo, who was just starting to farm, engineer Rafael Angel Fierros, who came, and there were four other people.

13:09.848 --> 13:12.591
But he was the only person with a technical background.

13:12.631 --> 13:16.996
The others were, I would say, most of them kind of poor farmers that came.

13:17.557 --> 13:23.764
But one came, I left a connection here at Texas A&M.

13:23.784 --> 13:36.018
The second year when I was in Mexico growing my plots, 45, second, third year, 46, a young Aggie showed up.

13:36.078 --> 13:37.540
He was a Mexican.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.421
Pablo Mauri.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.584
And he said, I'd like to work to get some experience in your plots this summer.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.346
And I said, OK, come on and work.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.247
He was studying here.

13:46.368 --> 13:52.375
He came from a family in the state of Puebla who had lost all of their land during the reform.

13:52.435 --> 14:01.565
And his father, his mother's husband, he was a three quarters brother to the man I'm going to tell you about.

14:02.086 --> 14:03.728
Kind of complicated situation.

14:04.108 --> 14:08.593
He was shot and killed from ambush when the farm was taken over.

14:09.299 --> 14:29.451
And so he worked, and he was a very enthusiastic guy, and he said, my brother has just got some land in Sonora that were given as compensation as just brush for what was taken away from us 20 years ago, or essentially 20, a little more than 20.

14:30.545 --> 14:33.609
And he said, his name is Roberto, and I want you to meet him.

14:33.649 --> 14:34.390
He needs help.

14:34.410 --> 14:39.737
He doesn't know anything because we lost our land, and he never had a chance to work on the land.

14:39.857 --> 14:41.680
So he was one of the people that came.

14:43.262 --> 14:49.750
And it was contact, one of my closest and most intimate contacts for all of those years, and we're still close friends.

14:50.011 --> 14:51.813
He became a very good farmer.

14:51.833 --> 14:58.442
And this other one engineer, Fieros, and three other farmers,

14:58.895 --> 15:00.417
not of much substance.

15:02.800 --> 15:17.481
But the curious thing was during the course of the week when we were pulling out plants and trying to trash and harvest and busy, here would come two or three farmers, say, we hear that you've got some interesting things going on out here.

15:17.501 --> 15:27.535
And this went on, I don't know how many there were, maybe 20 more in groups of two or three, including Kais came by.

15:28.983 --> 15:36.915
And so the next year, and then I thought it was time that we tried to reestablish wood relations with Kais.

15:37.836 --> 15:55.682
And so when we showed them those plots in that spring of 48, I said, we're going to multiply these this summer, thrashing these, there'll be a couple of tons of seed

15:56.033 --> 15:59.498
of total to three, maybe three tons, which it turned out to be.

16:00.079 --> 16:12.557
I'll put it on this truck, I'm taking it up the high valleys, I'm going to plant it in early May, and we'll ship back some considerable quantities of seed from other vacation.

16:13.658 --> 16:21.349
And I would like to see part of this planted on at least three farms, maybe five.

16:22.139 --> 16:28.989
depending on how much seed we get, how good our multiplication is, because this was new, too, in the summer.

16:30.552 --> 16:42.349
And there were some people interested, and especially this guy who had given us his machinery, this engineer Fierros who graduated from Chipengo.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.973
Roberto Mauri, I'd gone out to see his farmer.

16:44.993 --> 16:51.403
He was pretty darn miserable, all full of weeds, and he didn't have equipment either, and I wasn't sure that he

16:51.923 --> 16:53.806
was a very good farmer.

16:53.906 --> 16:55.148
He wasn't at that time.

16:55.168 --> 16:55.709
He became one.

16:56.049 --> 16:56.851
Yeah.

16:56.871 --> 16:59.835
And so, I didn't give him any of the seed.

17:02.539 --> 17:04.983
And so, he put it around on about four farms.

17:06.145 --> 17:17.863
And, of course, Cayce, the innovator he was, he had come up into Texas and he had seen the variety Austin.

17:18.974 --> 17:36.459
which was a sister to one of the varieties that we had tested and really multiplied for central Mexico, but it didn't fit Sonora because beautiful plants, big head, yielded pretty well, but it had a sterile neck and it was fragile.

17:36.479 --> 17:40.324
And when the wind would blow and when it was dry, the whole head would fall on the ground.

17:41.526 --> 17:45.792
And it would happen right when you were ready to start the harvest.

17:46.514 --> 17:52.502
And so, Caiz used to like to stick needles in me, and I think he wasn't convinced even then.

17:53.723 --> 18:02.574
So, he condescended to plant a part of this first variety, Yaqui and Quintana, on his farm, but a bit begrudgingly.

18:03.375 --> 18:13.428
And it was on Ingeniero Fiero's farm and this elderly gent, Campoy, next door neighbor, and one other farm, I think.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.352
And about how many acres on each farm?

18:16.822 --> 18:24.390
I think at that time it turned out that there was probably five to ten acres, depending, varied from place to place.

18:24.430 --> 18:25.531
That's all the seed we had.

18:28.814 --> 18:32.118
But I skipped one thing that's important.

18:32.818 --> 18:38.244
After that harvest, when I moved the seed to Mexico, I refused to go back through the USA.

18:38.344 --> 18:46.052
I knew, by God, if I tried to go back through that with seed, I would never make it and they'd probably take it away from me.

18:46.758 --> 19:10.830
So I took off down through the desert and through there were a few trucks that were finding their way through and at that time the only way we could cross the rivers, they used to have two rowboats and they'd put planks across them, build a platform and you'd put the pickup on that or the truck and then they would pull you across the rivers.

19:10.850 --> 19:16.478
There weren't any ferries per se except these improvised ones.

19:17.318 --> 19:21.543
So, we got the seed back.

19:21.563 --> 19:22.765
It was a miserable thing.

19:22.805 --> 19:24.507
I slept up.

19:25.288 --> 19:32.857
We found a guy that... There's roads going every direction out through the desert, the Mesquite and whatnot.

19:32.877 --> 19:34.199
You don't know which one to take.

19:34.239 --> 19:38.144
So, late in the afternoon, we wanted to get the mochas the first night.

19:39.586 --> 19:40.847
We couldn't tell where we were going.

19:40.867 --> 19:46.414
There was a guy standing on the side of the road waving, and Rupert had gone ahead with the pickup.

19:46.799 --> 19:48.381
or he'd gone back the other way.

19:49.341 --> 19:51.143
And so, I was there with the truck driver.

19:51.784 --> 19:53.325
I wanted to make sure the seed went through.

19:54.186 --> 19:58.991
And this guy waved and wanted to ride, and we asked him if he knew the way to Moches.

19:59.011 --> 20:01.313
And he said, oh, sure, I know all of this very well.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.395
And so, he got up on top of the sacks.

20:06.538 --> 20:12.224
Hell, it was getting dark, and he'd send us off in the wrong direction, and he didn't know where he was either.

20:12.524 --> 20:13.785
Finally, we ended up

20:13.883 --> 20:19.328
in the dark as hell down in the narrow canyon where we couldn't turn around rocks and boulders.

20:19.368 --> 20:24.433
And I was afraid we were going to tear the whole bottom out of the motor or the transmission.

20:25.434 --> 20:28.517
And I said, we'll have to stop here.

20:28.537 --> 20:32.742
And Gustavo, the chauffeur, said, I'm worried about this character.

20:32.782 --> 20:36.205
He doesn't look like a very respectable citizen.

20:37.046 --> 20:38.908
He may club us over the head here.

20:39.668 --> 20:41.410
And I said, well, we'll make a show of it.

20:42.503 --> 20:44.065
And we had to cook our own food.

20:44.186 --> 20:48.733
I always carried food at that time, an old forestry thing.

20:48.753 --> 20:57.807
And so I got my shotgun out from behind the seat.

20:57.827 --> 21:05.799
By the same time I took my cooking gear and we cooked up supper there for the three of us.

21:06.941 --> 21:10.266
And Gustavo said,

21:11.815 --> 21:15.419
You sleep here in the cab, and I'll sleep up on top.

21:15.439 --> 21:18.522
And he made a big show of the shotgun.

21:19.363 --> 21:21.685
And this guy went to sleep over in the brush.

21:21.725 --> 21:23.287
He had a blanket.

21:23.327 --> 21:26.130
We weren't very comfortable, but nothing happened to us.

21:26.770 --> 21:35.659
And it took us the whole next day to get back and find where we should have gone to get across the next river, which is a big one, to the town of Los Moches.

21:35.699 --> 21:38.262
To make a long story short, it probably took us

21:40.216 --> 21:52.996
It probably took us four days to get to where the road was halfway decent, Guadalajara.

21:53.016 --> 21:58.344
But we got it planted and we got it done going.

21:59.105 --> 22:01.589
And what were the results?

22:03.232 --> 22:06.797
Okay, the next, I left out the,

22:07.081 --> 22:12.009
devilish trouble that we had of getting the seed that we planted that we are harvesting now.

22:12.069 --> 22:12.870
I forgot this.

22:13.911 --> 22:14.673
I nearly drowned.

22:14.713 --> 22:15.474
Drowned.

22:16.515 --> 22:16.896
You did?

22:16.936 --> 22:18.118
Where was this?

22:18.138 --> 22:22.404
This was in one of those same rivers that we were now trying to cross going south.

22:23.386 --> 22:24.968
Down toward Guadalajara?

22:24.988 --> 22:28.294
Down towards Guadalajara in the state of Nayarit.

22:28.854 --> 22:35.164
When we took the seed up that fall before which I'm speaking now to plant,

22:36.123 --> 22:38.325
I went by a different route.

22:38.345 --> 22:47.713
I heard that there was a new road being built from Durango, which is the road that went to El Paso.

22:49.134 --> 22:50.376
And I wanted to explore this.

22:50.436 --> 22:51.677
And there were two pickups then.

22:51.757 --> 23:01.005
Rupert had one, and he had one of our young Mexican engineers with him, Campos Tierra Fria, Alfredo Campos.

23:01.485 --> 23:04.628
And I had a young Guatemalan with me who was training with us.

23:04.996 --> 23:07.920
Oscar Neri Sosa.

23:07.940 --> 23:16.632
And we had the seed for the experimental plantings and we had these little bags that were the predecessors of these plots that I've just described.

23:18.254 --> 23:24.903
We drove, the road was paved up to Durango and went on to El Paso.

23:24.923 --> 23:27.106
Cidal Juarez and El Paso.

23:27.126 --> 23:33.214
But we turned off at Durango and took this road that went through the

23:33.312 --> 23:59.725
worst most rugged part of the of the sierra madre occidental it was opened probably originally because of lumbering timber industries logging company and it was went through really rugged country since then it's become a tourist attraction and it runs along the rim of the copper canyon

24:00.599 --> 24:09.887
Barranca de Cobre, which is as spectacular as the, and in some ways, much larger than Grand Canyon.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.289
Really rugged country.

24:12.930 --> 24:16.433
Turned out that it was in November.

24:16.453 --> 24:17.774
It wasn't supposed to be raining.

24:19.396 --> 24:28.564
But when we got out there, it started to rain, and this was a one-way brecha, just a one-way pass that had been opened.

24:29.253 --> 24:31.116
and the mud started sliding down.

24:32.878 --> 24:35.201
And so we were trapped with the two pickups.

24:35.301 --> 24:38.025
But in front of us, there was a truck that was also trapped.

24:38.105 --> 24:44.574
And it turned out that that truck was a government highway truck loaded with dynamite.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.717
And they were trapped in there also.

24:46.737 --> 24:49.101
And then behind us was another pickup.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.624
And we all got trapped in mudslides on both sides.

24:51.644 --> 24:58.534
We couldn't go and just narrowly look down at the face of the devil himself down there below.

24:58.970 --> 25:00.993
Couldn't go either way.

25:01.694 --> 25:02.835
Oh, I don't understand.

25:02.936 --> 25:03.997
Why couldn't you go back?

25:04.958 --> 25:08.984
Because there'd been another mudslide that came down after we'd come past it.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.050
My goodness, the quality of the road just must have been terrible.

25:13.070 --> 25:14.171
Oh, just narrow.

25:14.993 --> 25:17.716
And it gets slippery, this stuff that's sliding down.

25:18.397 --> 25:22.663
You didn't even dare to back up, but we had no choice.

25:22.703 --> 25:25.247
You couldn't, because there was another mudslide.

25:26.206 --> 25:40.367
And I was the only outfit that had, I had a big steel box in the back of my pickup, always had it, full of canned food and my cooking equipment and fishing tackle and my shotgun and sleeping bag.

25:42.210 --> 25:47.077
So hell, here we were trapped and I had to cook and feed these people.

25:50.242 --> 25:53.867
That day, and it kept wristling, it was miserable.

25:54.556 --> 25:59.020
kept a big fire going the whole time to keep warm.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.782
I sat around and drank coffee most of it.

26:00.862 --> 26:04.305
I had a sleeping bag, so I was all right, but most of them didn't.

26:04.325 --> 26:05.447
I was the only one that had this.

26:06.367 --> 26:17.038
And they were miserable and kept drinking with coffee and thinking somebody was going to come from the road outfit to get us the next day.

26:17.518 --> 26:20.301
The whole day went by and we were starting to run out of food.

26:20.361 --> 26:24.445
And I had two, six,

26:24.661 --> 26:25.983
nine people.

26:26.804 --> 26:30.190
I'd always had provisions for two or three, but not for nine.

26:31.372 --> 26:48.940
So it was into the second day when the big bulldozer finally showed up looking for that dynamite truck, and the pickup behind was the engineer in charge of that area of construction, the highway department.

26:50.243 --> 26:51.765
So they came looking for them,

26:52.387 --> 26:55.412
If you were lucky you were with them, you might still be down there.

26:55.432 --> 26:55.632
Sure.

26:55.872 --> 27:00.539
And so, to make a long story short, how to get it out of there.

27:01.741 --> 27:08.311
This bulldozer would start moving this stuff, and it would keep sliding again in front of the truck.

27:09.473 --> 27:21.111
But you kept pushing it, and you could hear it go crashing down this precipitous drop-off in this part of the cliff, right at the worst part.

27:21.749 --> 27:27.777
They call it the spine of the devil, this particular place.

27:36.068 --> 27:44.399
Finally, the engineer says, look, we're going to hook your pickup.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.201
I was the lead pickup.

27:46.902 --> 27:50.727
Then we had the seat and the whole thing there covered with canvas, of course.

27:51.837 --> 28:01.507
He says, we're gonna hook you on the back of that dynamite truck because there may be another one of these things slide down and we may be here a couple more days if we go one by one.

28:01.527 --> 28:07.233
And I said, are you sure that I'm not gonna float right over with this mud right over the cliff?

28:08.054 --> 28:10.417
He said, well, let's try it out.

28:10.437 --> 28:13.180
And so this was full of dynamite also.

28:14.641 --> 28:20.848
And so I got hooked on and we sort of floated across this mud.

28:21.520 --> 28:47.882
and got through and we got the other two through and we finally got to Mazatlan about 10 o'clock that night and Joe Rupert and I went into the bar to have a drink and I should have said that with this Mexican road engineer was a Soviet geologist and he was a pretty ornery character.

28:48.368 --> 28:58.445
Especially to Rupert, because when they were sitting around the campfire to keep from freezing to death, they started to exchange stories.

28:58.505 --> 29:02.071
He said, were you in service during World War II?

29:03.593 --> 29:04.294
Joe said, yes.

29:04.695 --> 29:05.596
He said, what theater?

29:06.638 --> 29:07.319
North Africa.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.583
Joe was in the Medical Corps.

29:10.238 --> 29:13.043
And this Russian was kind of a nasty guy.

29:13.183 --> 29:14.566
I don't think he meant to be that way.

29:14.626 --> 29:18.012
I think he didn't command the English language very much.

29:18.052 --> 29:22.080
And he said, oh, he said, hell, Rommel kicked the hell out of you guys from one end to the other.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.785
And boy, that wasn't any good for Joe.

29:25.746 --> 29:28.051
And so they just didn't hit it off at all.

29:28.091 --> 29:33.681
And sitting around there for a day and a half, a little more, close to two days,

29:35.045 --> 29:36.366
that didn't rub very well.

29:36.647 --> 29:51.482
So when we finally got a shower and we went into the bar before we were going to eat in this restaurant, and I was talking to Joe and he was still fuming about this Russian, and here he went and sat right beside him and started barbing again.

29:54.345 --> 29:56.447
So we couldn't go north.

29:57.008 --> 30:00.211
All of these rivers were in flood stage.

30:00.231 --> 30:01.272
Couldn't get across.

30:02.247 --> 30:02.888
with the seed.

30:03.208 --> 30:08.336
So we put Ingeniero Alfredo Campos with all the seed on the train.

30:08.396 --> 30:10.960
The train was still going across the railroad bridges.

30:12.322 --> 30:13.604
And what'd you do with the pickups?

30:13.624 --> 30:14.946
Did you put those on the train too?

30:14.966 --> 30:16.067
Couldn't.

30:16.087 --> 30:16.148
Oh.

30:16.168 --> 30:17.570
And so we had to go back.

30:17.670 --> 30:23.078
And so we put him in charge of making the plantings that I have just told about harvesting.

30:23.959 --> 30:25.381
And we headed back for Mexico.

30:25.421 --> 30:26.643
There was nothing else we could do.

30:26.683 --> 30:27.544
We couldn't get through.

30:27.925 --> 30:29.948
And we had plantings to make elsewhere.

30:30.729 --> 30:31.410
And then we got

30:31.930 --> 30:36.615
down to a place in Nayarit, late in the afternoon.

30:36.635 --> 30:37.737
It was just getting dark.

30:38.758 --> 30:41.501
And there were some women picking up their laundry on the side of the road.

30:41.541 --> 30:48.329
And I said, where's the batanga, those rowboats that take the pickups across?

30:48.429 --> 30:51.252
And they said they left about an hour ago.

30:51.272 --> 30:55.737
But they said the truck just went across there after they'd left.

30:57.479 --> 30:58.360
There's a wide river.

31:00.095 --> 31:01.517
And I always carried equipment.

31:01.597 --> 31:15.874
I carried the rubber hose that I put over the exhaust pipe and tie it up above the back that they'd pick up and take off the fan belt and put a split old inner tube over to keep the wire from getting shorted out.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.757
And I'd gone across pretty deep water.

31:18.618 --> 31:21.561
So there was no place to stay there, no place to eat.

31:22.402 --> 31:26.187
And we were only about seven or eight miles from the little town.

31:27.213 --> 31:34.162
And I also saw, before it was too dark, that there was a road camp, construction, just across the river.

31:35.763 --> 31:42.692
So I took off across this, and I told Joe, you better not get in too far here, till we see what happens.

31:42.732 --> 31:49.420
Hell, I got out there, and the next thing I knew, that damn water was up in my feet, inside the cab.

31:50.181 --> 31:53.305
And the motors, of course, shorted out, and...

31:53.858 --> 32:00.526
Jesus, I was out and the water was fast and was nearly dark.

32:00.546 --> 32:01.747
Not a nice place to spend the evening.

32:02.388 --> 32:08.736
No, and I wasn't sure that I could suddenly begin to realize that the river must have been rising since that truck went through.

32:09.056 --> 32:10.318
Sure.

32:10.338 --> 32:14.863
There'd been rains, the same rains that we'd come through, draining all down into this.

32:15.824 --> 32:19.068
And so, I fortunately took off my boots.

32:20.770 --> 32:22.532
And hell, I got into this and

32:23.103 --> 32:27.910
I had to swim and struggle, and it carried me downstream, but I got to the other shore.

32:30.693 --> 32:37.283
Then I went up to that, and I told Rupert to stay, and the guy that was with me in the cab, I had a terrible time.

32:37.303 --> 32:49.279
It was a Sunday evening, and I went to find at this work road camp the engineer in charge of the construction crew, and he'd gone to this movie about eight miles away.

32:50.272 --> 33:04.527
and I had no way to get there, and they didn't have any transport, and I found the operator of this big lever, you know, the one with the big blade conformador, we say in Spanish, I don't remember what you call them in English.

33:05.127 --> 33:06.028
Like a bulldozer?

33:06.509 --> 33:09.532
Yes, but not the bulldozer, the ones that you would level with.

33:10.052 --> 33:10.473
Grader?

33:10.793 --> 33:11.154
Grader.

33:12.435 --> 33:15.418
The bulldozer wasn't there, it was farther away.

33:15.938 --> 33:17.440
where they were working on beds.

33:17.940 --> 33:20.003
And I said, look, this is a government truck.

33:20.023 --> 33:21.164
We've got two of them down there.

33:21.184 --> 33:22.626
We're going to loose them with this flood.

33:23.727 --> 33:26.630
Help.

33:26.650 --> 33:30.835
He said, I can't do it without the engineer's approval.

33:31.035 --> 33:32.677
I said, well, we can't get down there.

33:32.737 --> 33:34.579
He said, I don't have any transport.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.461
I said, these are official cars.

33:37.402 --> 33:43.549
And I'll take the responsibility and explain it to them as soon as we get these salvaged.

33:44.390 --> 33:50.940
Then he said, well, there's very little gas in the tank, and I don't have a key to the gas tank.

33:52.041 --> 33:56.929
And I stuck a stick down there, and it's true, there was very little, but I said, let's have a go at it.

33:56.949 --> 34:02.737
And they had some big, long cables like this, and I got about eight people with me, and we went out there.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.001
In the greater?

34:05.902 --> 34:07.765
In the greater, we had long cables.

34:09.044 --> 34:12.950
And by then, the water was running over the top of the hood.

34:12.970 --> 34:16.014
And this guy that I'd left there was standing on top of the cab.

34:17.176 --> 34:26.049
Of course, I didn't know it with the current, because it dug this thing down so that the whole chassis was sitting on the gravel.

34:28.753 --> 34:32.318
Then I figured, well, as soon as we pulled it free, why did it flip over?

34:33.260 --> 34:39.406
First, we had a devil of a time, we had a big loop on it, getting it hooked under the bumpers of all we could hook onto.

34:39.826 --> 34:42.049
The water and running fast.

34:43.730 --> 34:46.133
And it took us quite a while till we finally got it hooked on.

34:46.193 --> 34:52.499
And then I said, all right, now all of us have to hang on the upstream side or it'll flip over like this when we pull it loose.

34:53.660 --> 34:56.182
We got it pulled out and it floated.

34:57.504 --> 35:00.887
And we got it out and we pulled Rupert across.

35:01.643 --> 35:05.508
And that's all we could do then, but we were done up.

35:06.329 --> 35:09.934
The next morning, when the engineer came, I explained.

35:10.154 --> 35:11.856
You didn't run out of gas then, with a grant?

35:11.876 --> 35:11.936
No.

35:12.817 --> 35:13.298
We made it.

35:14.019 --> 35:21.749
And so, the next morning, we started to see what we could do.

35:21.809 --> 35:25.433
There wasn't a drop of oil in the crankcase.

35:25.453 --> 35:26.875
It had all floated out.

35:27.648 --> 35:29.711
everything was a mess.

35:30.351 --> 35:33.415
It took us most of the day to get the two cars started again.

35:34.977 --> 35:35.979
But we salvaged them.

35:36.479 --> 35:37.841
And I got back to Mexico.

35:38.942 --> 35:41.385
So you can see some of the things that we had to do.

35:41.646 --> 35:44.049
Okay, that seed, compost took it up and planted it.

35:45.150 --> 35:48.434
And now, this is out of order, but you'll be able to sort it out.

35:49.496 --> 35:54.782
The results were what that field day, what we showed the farmers.

35:54.802 --> 35:56.845
But before we showed them that,

35:57.382 --> 36:01.228
Oh, this story happened before the first field day?

36:02.049 --> 36:03.471
No, before the second one.

36:03.671 --> 36:04.933
Oh, that's right.

36:04.953 --> 36:12.985
This one where we had beautiful things and where there were 200 rather than 25, and most of them were four years.

36:13.005 --> 36:15.428
So we're in 1948, basically, is that when?

36:16.710 --> 36:19.034
Yes.

36:19.054 --> 36:21.798
The fall of 47 was what I just described.

36:21.818 --> 36:23.020
Was the first field day?

36:23.540 --> 36:24.482
No.

36:24.502 --> 36:24.902
Oh.

36:24.922 --> 36:25.363
Yes.

36:25.681 --> 36:30.150
That was the spring of 1947 was the first year.

36:30.290 --> 36:36.423
What we're talking about now is between the spring and fall of 1947.

36:36.443 --> 36:37.164
Yes.

36:37.184 --> 36:37.685
Okay.

36:37.805 --> 36:46.122
The fall of 1947 was this struggle where we couldn't get the seed through except on the train and they nearly got drowned going back.

36:46.423 --> 36:46.643
Okay.

36:47.146 --> 36:53.233
Then I went up there and spent most of January, February, March and... 48.

36:53.273 --> 36:55.255
48.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.998
And these were beautiful then.

36:58.118 --> 37:01.742
We had this second field day organized and there were probably 200.

37:01.862 --> 37:03.524
I have the exact numbers.

37:04.525 --> 37:13.795
And there was Cayce and there was Jorge Parada and Eduardo Vargas who were...

37:14.028 --> 37:16.732
two or three of the best farmers in the area.

37:17.273 --> 37:28.629
By then we had also had results for the second year on fertilizer, but we hadn't shown it to them yet.

37:29.270 --> 37:31.553
But the important thing here was these plots.

37:32.194 --> 37:36.100
We didn't show them even this time, the fertilizer tests.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.001
And they were beautiful.

37:37.362 --> 37:39.765
But just a matter of

37:41.753 --> 37:44.296
And we showed it to them and they were pretty impressed.

37:45.557 --> 37:54.306
And I asked Caiz and Fieros and this elderly farmer neighbor, Campoy, how their plots looked, their entries.

37:55.287 --> 38:07.260
Well, Fieros and Campoy were pretty enthusiastic, but Caiz was pretty ultra conservative and he said, well, I got a better wheat that I bought in Texas.

38:08.341 --> 38:09.803
I suspected what it was.

38:10.188 --> 38:14.613
I said, I'm going to stop and see it next Saturday when I go for groceries.

38:16.115 --> 38:20.100
And so I did, and it had been planted early.

38:21.241 --> 38:32.815
And that Saturday, I stopped and looked at it, and I knew what it was.

38:33.275 --> 38:33.996
It was Austin.

38:35.217 --> 38:36.619
And I said, but down the road they'll fall.

38:36.819 --> 38:40.043
It looks beautiful now, but those heads will fall off.

38:41.221 --> 38:50.515
Unless you harvest it a little on the green side, when the wind starts blowing in the low environment or low relative humidity, they'll all break and they'll be on the ground.

38:53.019 --> 38:55.182
What did he say about it?

38:55.202 --> 38:58.768
Well, he thought I was exaggerating.

38:59.870 --> 39:04.176
I asked him about his Yaqui and Kentan and he said, well, they don't look very impressive.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.663
It so happened that I

39:09.318 --> 39:12.823
I had to go back again on Sunday.

39:12.843 --> 39:15.067
I don't remember what the occasion was.

39:15.087 --> 39:18.211
Something I had to get to finish our harvest, I guess.

39:19.173 --> 39:24.861
And as I drove by this farm, here he is out there waving his hands and screaming and hollering.

39:24.881 --> 39:30.149
And he had three combines out in this seven or eight hectare field.

39:31.451 --> 39:34.195
And I stopped and went in and said, what's the matter, Don Rodolfo?

39:34.917 --> 39:35.999
He says, look at it.

39:36.019 --> 39:38.844
Yesterday when we looked at it, it was standing beautifully.

39:38.885 --> 39:42.992
And he said, look, there's 25, 30% of the heads already on the ground.

39:44.014 --> 39:45.657
I couldn't say, that's what I told you.

39:47.080 --> 39:51.328
But this made a complete turnaround.

39:51.428 --> 39:55.997
And he still didn't talk about the Zyati or Cantana.

39:56.517 --> 40:00.082
And he hadn't harvested when I left to make the summer plantings.

40:01.184 --> 40:04.749
But it turned out that they were excellent compared to anything else.

40:04.989 --> 40:06.892
And from then, we were going downhill.

40:07.673 --> 40:12.600
But the farmers had counted, the ones that counted.

40:13.901 --> 40:16.325
And tell me about these two different types of weeds now.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.768
The first two that we multiplied?

40:19.169 --> 40:20.971
Yeah.

40:20.991 --> 40:22.153
Well, we produced them.

40:22.555 --> 40:25.900
in three and a half years instead of 10.

40:26.781 --> 40:29.005
We had them going out onto farms.

40:29.045 --> 40:33.712
Why could you do that when others thought you could never do that?

40:33.732 --> 40:38.699
Because we didn't pay any attention that they had to be selected all the time in that same environment.

40:39.240 --> 40:50.537
We moved them across 700 miles of latitude from 28 to 18, and from 120 foot above sea level up to 8,500 feet.

40:51.057 --> 40:59.465
in order to find the right environment for the growth of the plant at different seasons in that geographic area.

40:59.485 --> 41:01.046
We couldn't replant it on the coast.

41:01.166 --> 41:04.830
Temperatures were high at Cook in the summer.

41:04.850 --> 41:10.415
And we couldn't replant it always in the High Valley or we wouldn't know whether it would fit on the coast.

41:10.936 --> 41:17.802
But when you moved them back and forth and you selected for the best plants under both conditions, suddenly they fit.

41:17.822 --> 41:18.803
The book was wrong.

41:19.188 --> 41:21.171
The book was right for the time it was written.

41:21.852 --> 41:21.952
Sure.

41:21.972 --> 41:35.852
But this, 25 years later, became the basis of why we were able to move whole shiploads full of seed halfway around the world to India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, and so on.

41:35.872 --> 41:37.895
To Argentina, Brazil.

41:39.057 --> 41:44.725
But we didn't know... Because what you had done then is develop a type of wheat that was... Photo-insensitive.

41:44.845 --> 41:47.289
Photo-period insensitive.

41:47.309 --> 41:48.030
Okay, what is that?

41:49.867 --> 42:01.138
Plants, this was in the early days when our agricultural crops were not thought to have been photoperiod sensitive.

42:02.880 --> 42:08.145
Now, and it was just opening up.

42:08.165 --> 42:19.857
It had been recognized, I think first in California, that the Christmas poinsettia, the one that sold at Christmas in the northern

42:20.275 --> 42:21.497
part of the U.S.

42:23.259 --> 42:31.791
There was a shrub of this growing in a yard and it had been shaded by the building so it didn't get the full hours of sunlight.

42:31.811 --> 42:36.457
And some of them came into flower and some didn't.

42:36.477 --> 42:37.679
And this provoked why.

42:38.400 --> 42:47.432
And already they had found out that chrysanthemums, if you shortened the day growing in the greenhouse, you would get them to come onto flower earlier.

42:48.574 --> 42:49.675
And this was...

42:50.110 --> 43:06.578
for homecoming and whatnot in the football games, the way they were already starting to grow chrysanthemums, to get them to flower at the right time of the year, by manipulating numbers of hours of sunlight or light.

43:07.519 --> 43:12.608
But, it was not thought to have been a factor in agricultural crops.

43:13.094 --> 43:14.636
or in animals.

43:15.257 --> 43:24.812
Now, of course, this is one of the explanations of the close fit, very often of adaptive varieties for climate and so on.

43:25.333 --> 43:25.613
Light.

43:25.794 --> 43:26.655
There can be others.

43:26.675 --> 43:27.256
Temperature.

43:27.697 --> 43:28.778
And it's pretty complex.

43:29.820 --> 43:32.444
Or in poultry.

43:32.464 --> 43:34.427
The reason they leave the lights on

43:35.251 --> 43:37.274
for a certain number of hours.

43:37.354 --> 43:40.017
I've forgotten what it is for egg production.

43:40.658 --> 43:42.340
I think they need about 14 hours.

43:43.441 --> 43:48.247
It's not just because they feed more, but it's got to do with the ovules functioning.

43:49.629 --> 44:02.625
It goes clear back to the wild, when they probably nested only, laid eggs only for a wild clutch of eggs, when they were still wild jungle cock.

44:04.225 --> 44:10.114
When the day length was right, they knew it was time to lay eggs, or the hormone system told them.

44:10.875 --> 44:12.578
They incubated and the chicks were born.

44:13.079 --> 44:24.356
But with modern egg production, you manipulate it so that that hen, with proper feeding and proper light, she continues to lay eggs the whole year.

44:26.119 --> 44:29.845
So all of this has unfolded since then, but we were dealing with this

44:30.213 --> 44:34.459
empirically without knowing what we were doing, but we could see it was working.

44:35.780 --> 44:43.851
And one of my former professors, not Stakeman, but Dr. Hayes, came down to visit us.

44:44.692 --> 44:51.681
By then we had these already out in commercial, must have been in about 1950 or so.

44:52.538 --> 44:54.881
And we were looking at our summer nursery in Chipingo.

44:55.081 --> 45:00.648
It was in July, early July, and it was about so high, about six inches high, before they hid it.

45:01.629 --> 45:06.656
And he said, Norm, where was this material grown last generation?

45:06.776 --> 45:08.558
And I said, .

45:08.578 --> 45:11.061
He said, I don't know anything about the geography of Mexico.

45:11.502 --> 45:13.144
Tell me in words I can understand.

45:13.584 --> 45:16.828
He was a very blunt individual, a very good scientist.

45:17.789 --> 45:22.275
So I told him, well, we're 18 degrees latitude here, and we're 7,500 feet.

45:22.795 --> 45:27.421
Last generation, and this was planted in late May.

45:28.322 --> 45:29.423
We're now early July.

45:31.786 --> 45:39.796
The last generation, it was planted in November at 28 degrees latitude, 700 miles north of the area at 120 foot elevation.

45:39.816 --> 45:47.845
And he held his hands up like this to his head, and he said, my God, you didn't learn the first lesson in my first plant breeding course.

45:48.707 --> 45:51.570
Don't you remember that you had to have

45:51.972 --> 45:56.918
The selections and the genotypes adapted to the environment in which you're going to grow them.

45:56.938 --> 45:58.480
I said, yeah, but there was something wrong.

45:58.540 --> 45:59.882
Something else has happened here.

46:01.504 --> 46:05.048
We've moved them back and forth, and we find some that adapt to both.

46:05.468 --> 46:11.976
They're already in commercial production.

46:12.076 --> 46:14.860
So how did your former professor take that?

46:14.880 --> 46:17.243
He didn't believe it really then.

46:17.263 --> 46:21.608
But it's a sad thing, and it shows how it haunted him.

46:22.600 --> 46:29.787
Late in life, I can't tell you when he had, he probably had Alzheimer's disease.

46:29.807 --> 46:31.629
He had lost his mental capacity.

46:32.890 --> 46:36.894
He lived several years in that befuddled situation.

46:37.774 --> 46:49.005
And I suppose it was long about 1966 or 7, sometime after these Mexican weeks were pretty well known in different places.

46:50.446 --> 46:52.168
I was in Minnesota and I...
