00:02.320 --> 00:07.900
February 14, Valentine's Day, sitting in the 
basement of the Weissenbaker building, getting

00:08.040 --> 00:13.540
ready to interview Charlie Holland, who got here a 
little more than 50 years ago. Charlie, test your

00:13.620 --> 00:14.681
mic. Testing one, two. Is it all right? For

00:18.600 --> 00:28.570
someone who may not have known you in a few years to 
come when they're looking at this material or

00:18.600 --> 00:28.570
listening to it, would you begin by summarizing 
your background and experience, where you grew

00:28.790 --> 00:34.670
up, went to school, your experience before you got 
to Texas A&M? Well, I grew up in western North

00:38.530 --> 00:45.270
Carolina, and my dad was a Baptist minister. In 
fact, I started the first grade the year he

00:46.870 --> 00:53.650
finished Wake Forest. He had been in World War I, 
and he decided to go down and finish up. So we moved

00:58.950 --> 01:04.310
to Wake Forest, and about Christmas time, the 
twins were born, and he took me out. He took me out of

01:05.650 --> 01:10.550
the first grade, because he was afraid I might 
bring home some childhood diseases. And then the

01:11.970 --> 01:18.740
next year after that, we moved to Mountain View, 
and I was just recently at Christmas going up there

01:19.180 --> 01:23.320
looking for the place that we moved to. It was on a 
dirt road out from North Wilkesboro, and this will

01:27.320 --> 01:31.980
kind of give you the view of what things were like in 
those times. And he was pastor of a little Baptist

01:33.560 --> 01:36.360
church. There was a Baptist junior college high 
school, and he taught the mathematics there. And

01:42.140 --> 01:47.700
this was back in time that the Depression was 
coming on us out there. And all he got out of that

01:48.820 --> 01:53.480
year's teaching at that little junior college was 
an Underwood typewriter, which I have at home.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.161
That was all they could pay. And I went to school. It 
was a little one-room schoolhouse. First grade in

02:03.840 --> 02:05.980
the first row, second grade in the second. 
Pot-bellied stove. Down at the bottom on old slick

02:08.050 --> 02:11.130
red hill was an outhouse. And all the kids went to 
the outhouse. And also the water was simply a

02:13.290 --> 02:17.790
barrel, just like you'd see a keg of beer. And so Dad 
said, when we went there, I better put you back in

02:19.020 --> 02:24.320
the first grade, because I'm afraid I don't want 
you to get behind. So I started out in the first.

02:29.220 --> 02:33.440
Well, in that school, you could get promoted. All 
you had to do was just show you could do the second

02:34.260 --> 02:37.360
grade work. So before that... The year was over. I 
was over in the second grade, second row. They'd

02:41.340 --> 02:42.361
moved me to the second. So you just changed seats. 
You didn't know... No paperwork. Before the end of

02:46.300 --> 02:47.960
the year, I was in the third row. Well, then we moved 
to Stony Point, which is about 60 miles from

02:48.980 --> 02:53.820
Charlotte. And it's still very primitive in those 
days, but it did have a consolidated school. They

03:02.780 --> 03:05.700
bused all the kids from the county into that 
school. So Dad said, well, I know you were in the

03:06.400 --> 03:08.820
third. You were in the third grade there, but I 
think I'll put you back and let you do the second

03:08.800 --> 03:12.180
over. I don't want you to get behind. Well, they put 
me in that second grade, and I stayed the whole

03:13.860 --> 03:16.440
year, because they didn't know how to get me out of 
it, even though I knew it. Well, right after

03:19.760 --> 03:24.120
Christmas, we went back there and was looking for 
this. We wanted to go to all the places that we'd

03:24.220 --> 03:26.300
lived. And so we went to North Wilkesboro, and 
there was a bypass, and we stopped at a McDonald's.

03:32.070 --> 03:35.070
And this Mountain View wasn't even on the map yet. 
And so we went there to stop at a McDonald's. And I

03:39.120 --> 03:41.120
saw a well-dressed lady over there. And I went over 
and struck up a conversation with her. And I asked

03:45.380 --> 03:48.320
her if she knew where Mountain View was. She said, 
oh, it's just right up here. You turn off, right up

03:49.420 --> 03:51.001
the road here. Now, let me point out that in those 
years, Wilkes County was noted to be the biggest

03:54.140 --> 04:00.300
white lightning county in the United States. And 
so she said, yes. I said, I went to school there,

04:04.660 --> 04:09.320
one-room schoolhouse, outhouse down the bottom. 
And so then I went on back and sat down. She came back

04:13.580 --> 04:21.790
over afterwards, and she told my daughter or my 
sister that her husband had passed away. And she

04:22.510 --> 04:25.990
says, well, what did he do? She says, oh, he was a 
bootlegger. She says, that was the only way to make

04:29.070 --> 04:31.610
a living in those years. She says, well, didn't the 
law get after him? She said, oh, yes. He built time

04:34.650 --> 04:36.670
five different times. So this was kind of the. uh 
area that i was i grew up in uh uh and uh at the my dad

04:39.630 --> 04:49.500
and i he was always gone a lot and so forth and we just 
didn't have these father to son talks that you

04:49.480 --> 04:57.340
always have nowadays you'll hear of like andy 
hardy and judge stone the closest we ever came to it

04:57.320 --> 05:03.180
was the day we were packing the car he's getting 
ready to take me off to this little baptist junior

05:03.160 --> 05:08.140
college mars hill out from nashville north 
carolina and it was always assumed that i'd go to

05:08.120 --> 05:16.000
college it was never even we just didn't discuss it 
and i delivered papers there and i knew all the

05:15.980 --> 05:21.680
professional people in town and they said you've 
got there's a lot of emphasis there on you need to

05:21.660 --> 05:26.640
you need to go to college and make something 
yourself you heard that over and over again and so

05:26.620 --> 05:33.140
as we were packing the car dad said to me he says son 
uh uh what are you going to study when you get here

05:38.920 --> 05:44.740
get up there i said well dan i thought i'd study 
dentistry he said no son i don't think i'd do that if

05:44.720 --> 05:49.540
i were you i don't believe you'll ever be able to 
keep up with your tools well see i lost his saw and

05:49.520 --> 05:54.340
hammer so many times that uh he was just and he said 
why don't you just go ahead and study engineering

05:54.320 --> 06:01.620
well that's what i did and uh so after the 
pre-engineering course up there mars hill i went

06:01.600 --> 06:08.340
north carolina state and my junior year i was 
having breakfast and that's when pearl harbor hit

06:08.960 --> 06:14.020
and i was in my junior year and i was in the car the day 
we were packing the car the germans marched in

06:14.000 --> 06:18.580
europe which marked the beginning which is the day 
i started to college and then when i was in my junior

06:18.560 --> 06:24.820
year at north carolina state the germans uh the 
pearl harbor occurred so i went down and i didn't

06:24.800 --> 06:30.420
want to get drafted i wanted to finish school so 
what i did was they had a program there where you

06:30.960 --> 06:36.500
could become get a direct commission even though 
you hadn't been in rotc they had an rotc there and

06:36.480 --> 06:38.820
people marched around all the time and wasn't any 
point in taking it because i could only do two years

06:38.960 --> 06:43.220
of it so i didn't take it and uh but i went down and got 
a direct commission to go in the navy and so as soon

06:43.840 --> 06:49.740
as i finished college i had to go in the navy and i was 
in the navy and on destroyers for about just nearly

06:49.720 --> 06:56.300
four years was a tour date and the roughest duty 
that we had was on oklahoma we went up there with

06:56.280 --> 07:02.780
nine destroyers in the squadron and this is where 
the kamikazes and for about two or three months we

07:08.520 --> 07:09.022
were exposed to kamikazes every day and we lost six 
out of our nine destroyers there were only three of

07:15.640 --> 07:21.860
us that made it back and it was just a matter of luck 
we weren't that much better and we just when they'd

07:22.640 --> 07:25.620
hit one station we'd be on another one or the plane 
that was coming in at you we got it shot down well uh

07:26.480 --> 07:34.540
then after the war i thought about going to georgia 
tech but it turned out that there was no housing

07:34.520 --> 07:39.420
down there so i decided to work for georgia tech and 
i decided to go back to north carolina state and

07:39.560 --> 07:45.980
they had put me into a little program that was 
supposed to be training the plant managers of the

07:45.960 --> 07:51.260
future well it turned out it looked like i was going 
to have to work on the third shift for about 10 years

07:51.240 --> 07:56.540
15 so i decided i'd just go back to graduate school 
and went back to north carolina state and dr

07:56.520 --> 08:02.220
lindsay had taught down there and so they gave me 
his name i called him and came got in touch with him

08:02.200 --> 08:08.770
and so we came out here and i began

08:09.630 --> 08:17.730
in chemical engineering in january of 1948. 
that's it you came to texas in january 1948 and i

08:18.590 --> 08:23.490
promised my wife because we'd been out here on when 
i was on the destroyer promised her we'd never stay

08:23.470 --> 08:30.530
in texas as soon as i got my degree we were leaving 
well we stayed just here describe what was what

08:30.510 --> 08:36.690
texas a m was physically what was okay what 
buildings give you the whole picture um well i have

08:38.380 --> 08:39.201
some history with that people were in this 
building when i was 10 years old but i came up to the

08:45.500 --> 08:50.060
ms dot school and said you know what we'll go back to 
north carolina and i thought okay well what do i do

08:50.600 --> 08:54.780
what do i do what do i do i can't do it right i thought i 
was going to stay in texas and i said well you know

08:55.800 --> 09:00.060
what i'll stay at this school you can't do it right i 
can't do it right and i said well i'm going to go back

09:00.040 --> 09:02.220
to north carolina and go do it because i'm going to 
do it in our national assembly and so i said yeah you

09:02.200 --> 09:06.300
know where's the mc familias any mi mc familias 
where's a mc familias see you in your class and he

09:06.280 --> 09:10.140
said yeah well he's in the ms quadrillion but he was 
a classical type individual and he said so he

09:11.160 --> 09:17.520
called up bolt boltman's executive vice 
president said get this get him a room a place to

09:17.500 --> 09:23.600
stay up there so after i'd already come here and 
gotten settled uh i was over in lindsey's office

09:23.580 --> 09:29.170
one day mr bolton called up and he said he wanted to 
see me boy they were just shaking over there i went

09:29.150 --> 09:34.770
over so he told me but the amusing thing is and then 
he ended up saying well just go over here and oh i've

09:34.750 --> 09:40.850
forgotten boyette go see him he's in charge of 
housing and that was uh what i got out of him about uh

09:48.620 --> 09:51.760
a month or so we were down there visiting with mr lee 
again he said he said well i suppose you know bolton

09:53.450 --> 10:00.270
well by now i said i'm sorry mr lee our paths haven't 
crossed any since that one time i met him but uh dr

10:00.250 --> 10:06.430
lindsey was head of the uh chemical engineering 
department we were over there in the old petroleum

10:06.410 --> 10:12.370
building uh at that time barlow was the dean of 
engineering uh and uh saul wright was head of uh

10:12.510 --> 10:21.820
civil uh charlie crawford was head of mechanical 
um let's see uh shepard was dean of agriculture

10:21.800 --> 10:32.020
petroleum no petroleum harold vance was head of 
petroleum and shepard was head of agriculture and

10:32.000 --> 10:38.180
i don't remember i remember mr porter was head of 
the math department but i don't know who was the

10:43.920 --> 10:49.380
science dean i think pearson was dean of the 
graduate college followed later by trotter but

10:49.360 --> 10:53.140
pearson i believe was the dean when i came here i 
worked most of the time dealt with trotter's group

10:53.120 --> 11:00.300
over there and uh i think that's let's see street 
was teaching drawing and uh i can't remember the

11:01.480 --> 11:08.130
fellow's head of arrow uh and that was that's about 
the one there were no sidewalks it was all actually

11:08.110 --> 11:14.530
it was the same way it was in 1943 they had not done 
nothing except tear down the wall they had never

11:15.070 --> 11:21.730
done it before and that's in today's world war and 
what i came in we had you'd already gotten over the

11:22.700 --> 11:27.280
flood here but there's still a lot of veterans and i 
would say that that was the toughest group to

11:28.060 --> 11:32.400
compete with i've ever ran against because all 
they want to know is what's required and we'll do it

11:32.380 --> 11:39.280
because you and and your other veteran buddies you 
were mentally emotionally mature ready to go to

11:39.820 --> 11:44.400
work ready to go to work you'd had experience 
everything was riding on it what was your what was

11:45.420 --> 11:51.360
your graduate student stipend or assistantship 
or what oh it was probably about a hundred dollars a

11:51.340 --> 11:59.220
month right now uh plus the gi bill i'm not even sure 
we got a hundred maybe we did i don't remember what

11:59.200 --> 12:03.700
it was but it was living in college view we could 
make it but see by the time i got ready to finish i ran

12:03.680 --> 12:10.750
out of the uh i took a job teaching i ran out of the gi 
bill so i had to take a job teaching and then i had to

12:10.730 --> 12:16.350
buy a house over in college hills and i bought one on 
harrington street over there it cost 13 700

12:24.890 --> 12:31.070
and that was the poorest year that i've ever 
experienced in my life uh we my salary was 370 a

12:32.120 --> 12:40.370
month and uh lindsay had to get special 
dispensation to get me 370. and so uh that's kind of

12:41.610 --> 12:47.950
what it was like here then now when did you switch 
officially in paperwork from being a graduate

12:48.810 --> 12:54.190
student to being a faculty member 52 okay so you're 
all right we're still talking about the graduate

12:54.170 --> 12:58.590
student days yeah well i finished i got my phd in 53 
but i don't know okay i took a job as instructor in 52

12:58.570 --> 13:08.770
i think it was and then uh i believe in uh i guess in 53 
that fall i went ahead uh i've forgotten whether i

13:12.650 --> 13:20.030
got promoted to assistant professor maybe i went a 
year before i got made assistant professor

13:20.010 --> 13:25.310
looking back now with the clear vision of 
hindsight what courses and what in teachers

13:26.780 --> 13:35.280
instructors were the most important to you well uh 
actually we had some things back then there that

13:36.060 --> 13:42.000
are better than they are now and that is it we took 
courses outside the department a lot of them and i i

13:43.760 --> 13:51.260
took mathematics i had luther i had baysy and then 
dr klippel and i and years later we worked on i'd

13:51.240 --> 13:58.540
just go over with him and spend an hour a day every 
once in a while every week we'd have a meeting and

13:58.520 --> 14:04.060
prove theorems and so on in chemistry uh jensen and 
dr watson i worked under murdoch phil murdoch in

14:04.040 --> 14:13.100
chemical engineering but Watson was one of them 
another one that I took course over there was pots

14:17.160 --> 14:24.760
organic chemistry and Kenny Hancock was another 
one that I took course under also took a physics

14:24.740 --> 14:28.960
course and Dr. Weeks taught it and then after I 
finished my coursework I went back and took

14:31.210 --> 14:34.590
another course in kinetic theory under Dr. Silvey 
which goes way back and old Dr. Silvey the first day

14:41.810 --> 14:47.150
there were three of us in there registered for his 
course and he two physics students and me and he

14:47.130 --> 14:55.380
said he said would Mr. Harlan would you like to 
participate in the classroom discussion and I

14:55.360 --> 14:59.780
said well I I believe I'd like to do that well what 
that amounted to were presenting one-third of

14:59.760 --> 15:05.960
that course for audit and then I also had their one 
under Dr. Weeks over there he was the and x-rays and

15:13.480 --> 15:16.860
x-rays and x-rays and x-rays and I never had 
vectors and he he just he had the course full of it

15:16.840 --> 15:22.200
but I learned it picked it up from him and I had to 
compete against two graduate physics students in

15:22.180 --> 15:28.210
there are three and so Jensen was an outstanding 
chemistry teacher Watson was not standing

15:35.250 --> 15:40.190
chemistry teacher in fact all of those people 
Potts was never a real outstanding teacher he had a

15:40.170 --> 15:44.210
tremendous amount of knowledge but he could never 
finish one sentence until he started another one

15:44.190 --> 15:49.310
now what was his first name because I remember Dr 
Potts in agriculture I'd know this was a different

15:53.550 --> 15:56.450
Potts I don't remember what his first name you just 
have to look at what what Department chemistry in

15:56.430 --> 16:01.190
in the chemistry he was the organic prof in 
chemistry Kenny Hancock taught a good course in

16:01.170 --> 16:05.750
chemistry all right what about what about within 
chemical engineering Phil Murdock I took a course

16:05.730 --> 16:14.860
under him and uh let's see you know that I may have 
taken most all the courses I took under him uh I took

16:14.840 --> 16:21.820
one under GL fair he he taught process control and I 
took that but we took in those years we were really

16:21.800 --> 16:28.620
taken see we didn't teach our own mathematics in 
our in our department and now all these people

16:28.600 --> 16:34.260
trying to do teach everything one department they 
never see the light of day outside the walls of

16:34.240 --> 16:39.180
their department did anybody do you remember any 
advice that somebody gave you which later proved

16:39.160 --> 16:45.060
to be very valuable advice to a chemical engineer 
oh I don't know uh I just kind of stumbled along I

16:45.160 --> 16:53.700
guess uh I very nearly quit uh shortly after about 
1955 because I went down to Exxon and at that work

17:03.020 --> 17:10.570
one summer and they wanted me to stay with Exxon and 
at that time I was making five thousand dollars a

17:10.550 --> 17:17.040
year Dr Harris was making uh 5100 a year and Dr 
Lindsay making 5200 a year and I was Assistant

17:17.080 --> 17:22.020
Professor professor and both of them were full and 
I figured well Why should I stay here when that's

17:22.000 --> 17:30.760
all I've got that's all the future I've got so it was 
uh Charlie Lynch incidentally and that old

17:30.740 --> 17:38.240
building was head of geology over there and that uh 
well what what persuades you to stay I just got

17:38.220 --> 17:48.890
thinking about it that uh I don't know uh uh what had 
happened was uh I had to hurry up and get through

17:50.010 --> 17:58.100
because that one year Phil Murdoch left and Watson 
left and all my committee left, so I really pushed

17:58.080 --> 18:03.060
that to get it completed. I wasn't really sure 
whether I wanted to stay, I guess, in that

18:05.320 --> 18:09.790
corporate structure. You don't have near as much 
freedom. What was your dissertation topic in your

18:13.070 --> 18:16.670
area of specialization? This was, I'd done my 
master's on distillation, and this one was on

18:16.650 --> 18:23.670
catalytic, study of catalysts. And so on my 
committee I had Dr. Potts from biology, or Potter,

18:24.720 --> 18:34.940
Potter from biology, and Dr. Weeks and Dr. Watson 
and Phil Murdoch, I believe, were the ones on it.

18:43.640 --> 18:48.180
And I couldn't get it arranged for the final 
meeting, and I went by Watson's house one,

18:48.540 --> 18:53.340
afternoon late, and he was sitting back in the 
backyard with his shirt off drinking beer. And I

18:53.880 --> 18:56.640
told him, I don't know, I'm going to be able to 
graduate this time because I can't get this

18:56.620 --> 18:59.540
committee together. Gordon said, oh, I can take 
care of that for you. And he went in and called them

19:02.460 --> 19:08.140
up, and we met over in the old patrolling building 
that night. He set it up, and we all met over there,

19:08.480 --> 19:12.160
and I got it over with, so I made it. Do you remember 
any special questions on that final oral exam? I

19:17.710 --> 19:18.451
don't remember. I do. I just remember that they 
asked me some question, and I guess when you're

19:22.470 --> 19:25.570
working on some of those things, you've got so many 
details in your mind, and it's some little simple

19:25.650 --> 19:31.980
something you won't see. And they asked me that, 
and then they found the weakness. And so they just,

19:36.160 --> 19:43.160
I don't remember what it was, but then they just, 
one after another, you know. And that part I

19:43.520 --> 19:45.600
remember. If you know it, let's go on to the next, 
you know. But if you ever find something that you

19:48.680 --> 19:51.880
didn't know. As you thought about it then and now 
look back, how did our chemical engineering

19:53.590 --> 20:01.650
department, how did our strength compare 
nationally in the mid-'50s? Oh, we were really a

20:08.680 --> 20:11.480
young department then. And, in fact, we got down 
because the salaries were so poor that at one time,

20:20.660 --> 20:25.680
we were down to just Dr. Harry's, Dr. Lindsay, and 
I. And we had to get some graduate students to help

20:25.880 --> 20:28.160
us out. So it was all we could do to even keep the 
doors open. You're saying three faculty? We got

20:32.300 --> 20:33.841
down to three faculty. Everybody quit because 
salaries, they went to industry or somewhere

20:37.140 --> 20:40.600
because salaries were so poor back in those days. 
And that's about when I was about ready to throw in

20:40.980 --> 20:44.020
the towel. But then where the real change come was 
when John Connolly got in there. Salaries went up.

20:50.410 --> 20:50.952
Ours went up. 30% a year for three or four years 
there. But now let's back up. John Calhoun came

20:57.260 --> 21:01.260
here as dean in the 50s, didn't he? Barlow was dean 
when I came here. Okay. And then John Calhoun came

21:04.860 --> 21:06.900
next. All right. Do you remember any early 
impressions of Calhoun as the dean? I just

21:14.100 --> 21:22.210
remember that he was much more energetic than, 
well, Barlow was energetic enough. Except that I

21:22.190 --> 21:28.350
thought Calhoun was a much better individual than 
Barlow was. What, did Calhoun, did he come over and

21:28.650 --> 21:31.750
visit? Did he become acquainted with you all? Oh, 
yeah. He had us over. He had me over to his office.

21:37.610 --> 21:40.050
And I think he was kind of leery of old Dr. Lindsay. 
And Doc had already told him, Calhoun told me, he

21:41.470 --> 21:44.570
says, well, here's my territory and over there's 
yours. Don't you get in here. Don't you come across

21:49.490 --> 21:50.751
this. But he did. And Doc had asked me one time, he 
had me in his office talking. I think I irritated

21:55.530 --> 21:59.130
him because he said to me, he said. Wait, you're 
saying he, is this? Calhoun. That's Calhoun.

22:02.630 --> 22:02.798
Okay. He wanted to know any disincentives or 
negative things about Lindsay. I said, well, even

22:12.120 --> 22:15.440
if I had some, I wouldn't tell you. So that ended 
that discussion. I may have hurt his feelings, but

22:18.160 --> 22:21.880
I was pretty loyal to him. Old Doc. Old Doc did the 
best he could with what he had. And he didn't have

22:24.920 --> 22:26.421
much to work with. Now, the enrollment, I'm 
assuming, in engineering in the 50s was going up.

22:31.770 --> 22:32.312
Well, no. Actually, what happened was the 
enrollment of everybody went down to about 1955,

22:36.870 --> 22:37.891
which was a low point. Oh, okay. That was after the 
war was over. And this was about in there

22:40.690 --> 22:42.231
somewhere. Maybe even after that, they decided 
that they wanted to make it optional core a little

22:42.650 --> 22:47.250
bit. And I think we went on that program for a little 
while and enrollment started going up. Then we

22:51.410 --> 22:56.290
went back to compulsory core and it started going 
down again. So the enrollment never, you just do

22:56.370 --> 22:59.410
everything you wanted to and you couldn't end up 
with much more than two sections of about 20-some

22:59.390 --> 23:03.870
each. And you all still had the graduate program. 
Oh, yeah. During those dry years. And I presume

23:09.580 --> 23:17.190
that industry was generally hiring the bright 
youngsters when they graduated. Yeah, we had, we

23:17.170 --> 23:19.930
had, they were, we were always able to place them 
and we helped place all those people. The only year

23:24.450 --> 23:30.010
that I couldn't get them placed was, I believe, in 
about 1980 when enrollment had just gone out of

23:29.990 --> 23:33.050
proportion. And at the same time, the job market 
dropped completely. So we had a real problem then.

23:41.340 --> 23:44.240
But then Benson was after Calhoun. After Calhoun. 
Calhoun really wasn't deemed very long. Right.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.881
Now, he moves up to what? Oh. Was he assistant? He 
was, went up to vice-presidential,

23:51.120 --> 23:56.710
vice-president for engineering, I think. Right. 
When did you first meet Fred Benson? Well, I met him

24:01.500 --> 24:04.660
before he became dean. I knew him because we were 
both in a naval reserve unit together. And he

24:08.320 --> 24:11.780
wasn't very, and we actually were taking one of the 
math courses there together at one time. He was

24:14.080 --> 24:16.820
taking one course, a lower one than I was taking. 
Did he do his degree here? Yeah, he got, he got his BS

24:19.440 --> 24:21.260
at Calhoun. Oh. He got his B.S. at Kansas. And then 
he got a master's several years back at here. Okay.

24:27.760 --> 24:28.681
As I recall. And then he was taking some additional 
courses. Describe Fred Benson as a human being, as

24:31.700 --> 24:35.300
a personality. Well, we got along just fine. One of 
the things, when I got appointed, what he did was

24:38.640 --> 24:42.840
call me in one afternoon. He said, Charlie, I'd 
like for you to take over here as head of the

24:42.820 --> 24:47.350
department. Said, now, you don't have to tell me 
right now. You can wait until a little bit. A little

24:51.970 --> 24:54.110
later and tell me if you think it over. And so I did. 
And I wasn't really sure I wanted to. I really

24:58.640 --> 25:03.150
wanted to tell him, how about getting old Doc to 
take it one more year? I'd like to do the things I'm

25:03.210 --> 25:05.590
doing a little longer. But I decided to go ahead and 
take it because I thought that I could probably do

25:05.570 --> 25:11.750
more things that I wanted to do if I were head than I 
could if they got somebody from the outside and he

25:16.370 --> 25:18.530
started giving me all kinds of directions. When 
was that? What year? That was in 19... 1964. Right.

25:24.610 --> 25:25.631
What... At that point, you said things you wanted 
to do. What were your goals? Well, we had a... I'd

25:29.930 --> 25:38.630
gone to Exxon in 55 and gotten started modeling, 
doing distillation on computers and actually

25:38.610 --> 25:42.130
setting up programs to solve problems on them. And 
I worked with them, consulted with them, and I had

25:42.110 --> 25:45.630
graduate students. We'd try out new methods and we 
had an old 650 and that's what they had down at

25:45.610 --> 25:51.250
Exxon. And we had an old 650 and they put it up in the 
old EE building. Now this is an old key punch? Yeah,

25:57.230 --> 25:58.251
yeah. Punch card? It was up in the building. And my 
graduate students would go up there and use it at

26:00.230 --> 26:02.250
night. And it had a fire escape and so they'd go up to 
the fire escape and run that thing all night long.

26:07.230 --> 26:08.251
That's what we did. That's the way we got our time. 
And we had a lot of that going on. I'd written a book

26:11.520 --> 26:17.540
and a good many papers on it of methods that we had 
devised to solve these problems. So this was

26:18.520 --> 26:19.541
primarily... At this point, primarily... At this 
point, primarily petrochemically related.

26:23.520 --> 26:24.541
Yeah. Or you can do chemical either one. It's used 
in both fields, not just one. But back to Benson.

26:38.740 --> 26:39.761
Describe him. What did he like and not like? How did 
he operate? Well,

26:42.740 --> 26:49.370
I think although he would claim that he wanted 
everybody to say what they wanted to. He wanted to

26:50.350 --> 26:52.370
hear the right words. And he had around him people 
that he knew would always back him up. I remember I

26:57.350 --> 27:01.630
used to go in there to budget hearings. And he'd 
have Ed Fenner. Then he'd have Old Bain, Spencer.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.490
And he'd have two or three others like that. And 
he'd say something and they'd all chime in and

27:11.470 --> 27:16.490
agree. But he and I got along pretty well because I 
never did... I never did go in and ask him to solve my

27:19.470 --> 27:22.490
problems for me. I went ahead and solved the 
things. And the only time he and I got crosswise was

27:25.470 --> 27:33.160
he was pushing real hard for this Doctor of 
Engineering program. And he had all of us

27:35.070 --> 27:38.090
department heads in there one day. And what he was 
wanting us to do was agree not to weaken down the

27:38.070 --> 27:43.486
B.S. degree to where it would not be an accredited 
degree and have the Doctor of Engineering be the

27:44.070 --> 27:49.090
first accredited degree. And I stood up against 
him because I told him that we could not afford to

27:50.070 --> 27:56.380
have a large group of students coming out of here 
without an accredited degree. If we're going to

28:00.360 --> 28:02.116
give a B.S. degree, we'd better make it 
accredited. And he got so mad at me that he walked

28:04.840 --> 28:10.860
out and stayed gone for about 15 minutes. And then 
we finally decided we'd have it kind of optional.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.181
If they wanted... We'd always have the B.S. 
accredited. But if they wanted to go at an early

28:21.260 --> 28:25.280
stage somewhere over to the Doctor of 
Engineering, they could. And so we'd just leave it

28:26.260 --> 28:32.280
where whichever one won out would be the way we'd 
go. And I told him we were just not big enough to

28:32.260 --> 28:38.630
fight against the whole United States on one 
program like that. They'd run us out of business.

28:41.610 --> 28:43.630
So he and I... And then later he says, Charlie, you 
can do whatever you want to. He didn't.

28:50.610 --> 28:51.631
He just patted me down. And I said, Well, good for 
you. It was kind of bad that he wasn't here. He

28:56.610 --> 28:57.631
thought it was anity, or something. But I knew I was 
getting ready to die, and that I was going to get out

29:04.110 --> 29:06.150
and make a living myself. But I never really gave 
him any good results, and friends I met back in

29:06.130 --> 29:11.630
college, I don't remember some of them. Well, 
Chuck, he wasn't fit for engineering cars to date.

29:14.610 --> 29:15.631
That's what I think of it. Mitchell was a 
four-year-old swimmer. and you could make a good

29:16.610 --> 29:20.010
program out of that where you would actually do 
research on things that pertain to engineering

29:22.070 --> 29:24.390
per se more than you can on some of the directions 
they're going in because they get toward the

29:28.750 --> 29:32.360
science end of it, and then you're dealing with the 
physicists or the chemists and so on. So it was a

29:35.000 --> 29:36.581
good degree. It was just that I didn't think that we 
could swing it. What did happen to it? Well, I think

29:42.200 --> 29:45.360
they still give some of them, but there just wasn't 
the demand for it. It's just hard to sell. All

29:51.720 --> 29:54.220
right, so there was a key decision. That I had 
something to do with. I saved him there, really. In

29:59.440 --> 30:02.160
Benson's personality, did he laugh much? No, he 
was always just in the meetings. There was never

30:06.010 --> 30:07.191
much said. And he got to the point pretty quickly, 
didn't he? Oh, yeah, yeah. And it was well thought

30:13.100 --> 30:16.240
out. Anything he did was well thought out. He was 
good to work for. I didn't have a bit of trouble

30:20.490 --> 30:22.530
working for him. I mean, he knew that I wasn't back 
down anymore. I expressed my opinion. He didn't

30:30.670 --> 30:34.370
like it, but he respected it, and then he told me 
later, I think he really, it hurt him that he

30:37.410 --> 30:39.710
couldn't handle it better than he did. In your 
early years as department head, who were your key

30:43.230 --> 30:45.530
associates? As department heads elsewhere in 
engineering and anywhere else? Oh, well,

30:52.270 --> 30:53.990
actually, in those years, I knew all the 
department heads real well. But who were the ones

30:56.610 --> 30:59.190
you worked with most? Well, I knew Samang real 
well. He and I were well acquainted. Describe him.

31:04.850 --> 31:10.380
Well, he was very precise and very fair, and I had a 
lot of respect for him, and he did for me. Describe

31:18.280 --> 31:20.780
him physically.
