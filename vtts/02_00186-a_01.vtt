00:04.469 --> 00:10.736
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four, testing, one, two, three, four.

00:14.681 --> 00:20.067
Testing, testing, four, three, two, one, four, three, two, one, testing, testing.

00:23.511 --> 00:27.275
Testing, one, five, six, seven, nine.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.156
One, two, three, five.

00:29.818 --> 00:32.682
This is March 29, I believe it is.

00:32.842 --> 00:33.042
Correct.

00:33.764 --> 00:42.739
over in the College of Veterinary Medicine talking to Dr. Leon Russell, professor of veterinary anatomy?

00:43.541 --> 00:45.664
No, veterinary public health.

00:46.906 --> 00:47.968
You go on all of them?

00:48.109 --> 00:49.130
Yeah, yeah.

00:49.451 --> 00:55.401
Epidemiology in the School of Real Public Health.

00:55.381 --> 01:08.320
Professor, Faculty of Toxicology, Faculty of Food Science and Technology, and Professor, College of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology.

01:09.281 --> 01:12.847
That may be a record.

01:12.867 --> 01:18.655
To begin with, Leon, introduce yourself to the reader or listener.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.238
Where did you grow up?

01:21.079 --> 01:22.843
What did parents do for a living?

01:23.764 --> 01:27.271
Where did you go to high school, then undergraduate?

01:27.291 --> 01:34.805
In other words, tell us about, give us a biographical summary before you came to A&M to join the veterinary medicine faculty.

01:34.825 --> 01:35.226
Okay.

01:36.027 --> 01:37.690
I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

01:38.581 --> 01:41.189
I grew up there until I graduated from high school.

01:42.855 --> 01:44.039
My father was a dentist.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.068
My mother was a housewife.

01:48.493 --> 01:52.185
After my freshman year in college, Oklahoma State,

01:53.110 --> 01:57.338
My dad retired and moved back to Missouri.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.201
All my family was from Missouri except me.

02:00.002 --> 02:03.769
And he'd already made arrangements for me to transfer to the University of Missouri as a resident student.

02:03.809 --> 02:05.552
So he planned on me going there.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.716
So I went as a sophomore at the University of Missouri.

02:09.820 --> 02:10.541
Graduated from there.

02:11.623 --> 02:11.984
What year?

02:12.705 --> 02:13.987
In 19, B.S.

02:14.027 --> 02:14.548
1953, D.V.M.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.734
1956.

02:18.237 --> 02:23.423
And the College of Veterinary Medicine then was about five, six years old?

02:23.923 --> 02:27.067
It was first class graduate in 1950.

02:27.167 --> 02:27.467
All right.

02:28.268 --> 02:31.532
So it was six years old when I was sixth class to graduate.

02:31.572 --> 02:33.614
Your class, how many?

02:33.714 --> 02:37.719
We started with 30, we ended up 25, I think 26, 25 original.

02:37.819 --> 02:39.701
One transferred in Colorado State.

02:40.201 --> 02:40.722
Any women?

02:41.162 --> 02:41.523
No women.

02:41.823 --> 02:42.164
No women?

02:42.244 --> 02:44.466
No women in the Veterinary School at that time, completely.

02:44.807 --> 02:45.167
All right.

02:45.187 --> 02:47.029
Then after vet school, then what?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.898
Then I was waiting to go to the service.

02:52.042 --> 02:57.521
And by that time, the Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson, decided they didn't need veterinarians in the Army.

02:57.561 --> 02:58.825
They didn't have any more horses.

02:59.564 --> 03:02.930
And so I applied for commission with the Army and the U.S.

03:02.950 --> 03:03.571
Air Force.

03:03.591 --> 03:05.435
And while I was waiting, I went to work for the USDA.

03:06.577 --> 03:07.899
I got tired of that about after a year.

03:08.981 --> 03:15.673
And I had an offer for, I had a chance to actually contact me for a fellowship to Tulane University.

03:16.675 --> 03:22.686
So I went to Tulane and received my Master of Public Health there.

03:23.746 --> 03:27.854
After that, I went to work for the USDA for a short period of time again, still kind of waiting.

03:28.355 --> 03:39.257
And after a year of that, I'd been offered jobs at Iowa State, contact Oklahoma State, and also Texas A&M.

03:40.452 --> 03:50.263
In January of 1959, my wife and I went to interview in Ames, Iowa, and it was a snowy period.

03:52.846 --> 03:54.588
Shortly after that, we interviewed at Texas A&M.

03:54.688 --> 03:58.172
It was not a snowy period, and my wife kind of influenced me.

03:58.192 --> 04:00.034
She said, you ought to go where there's not that much snow.

04:00.734 --> 04:03.017
So anyway, we end up here in fall 19.

04:02.997 --> 04:05.080
Did you come down to visit College Station?

04:05.100 --> 04:06.002
Came down to visit down here.

04:06.042 --> 04:07.664
Actually came in August, so.

04:07.764 --> 04:09.087
August of 60 or 59?

04:09.107 --> 04:09.467
59, 59.

04:09.487 --> 04:10.068
59.

04:10.288 --> 04:11.150
Yeah.

04:11.170 --> 04:21.045
Describe your and your wife's impression of College Station and the vet school as a result of that.

04:21.065 --> 04:22.828
Well, it was a small town.

04:22.808 --> 04:31.839
I think at that time there was only one or two motels, Sabre Inn and I think what the other one was, two motels.

04:32.540 --> 04:40.710
The eating place was Hotard's Cafeteria and that's where Dr. Fred Jagie was, his department head was trying to recruit me, so he took us out to eat.

04:41.592 --> 04:43.534
So I remember that.

04:43.514 --> 04:44.857
And we kind of looked around town.

04:44.877 --> 04:49.004
There was two grocery stores, Orr's and Winds and Safeway, actually three.

04:49.866 --> 04:51.870
And it was a very small town.

04:51.930 --> 04:54.375
The vet school was very small but very friendly.

04:54.916 --> 05:03.632
And the campus was very small, but I think there were less than 7,000 students there at that time.

05:03.612 --> 05:05.975
But there wasn't much here compared to nowadays.

05:06.135 --> 05:08.558
But you had interviewed at Iowa State in the winter.

05:08.859 --> 05:10.220
In the winter, yes.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.742
And you came here in August.

05:11.782 --> 05:12.043
Yes.

05:13.545 --> 05:14.606
So it had two extremes.

05:16.789 --> 05:20.814
During the, as far as you recall, describe the interview.

05:21.214 --> 05:23.477
Who interviewed you and what did they chat about?

05:23.677 --> 05:26.020
I came and Dr. Jaggi interviewed me.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.563
Of course, he took me to Dean, Al Price.

05:31.046 --> 05:43.000
I met Dr. John Miliff and Dr. Leland Grumbles and just, you know, they just asked what I was doing, what I wanted to do, what kind of background I had and this type of thing.

05:43.260 --> 05:48.807
It's just a very, nothing very, I can remember its details.

05:49.698 --> 05:54.724
And as far as you know, were you the only interviewee or were you one of a number?

05:55.445 --> 05:55.866
I don't know.

05:56.006 --> 05:57.267
Be truthful about it.

05:59.270 --> 06:00.752
I met Dr. Jaggi.

06:00.912 --> 06:06.299
They had American Veterinary Medical Association that year, July, in Kansas City.

06:06.319 --> 06:07.900
And that's where we were living, Kansas City.

06:08.621 --> 06:13.147
And I'd gone there and somebody said, you have a degree in public health.

06:13.447 --> 06:16.431
And my friend said, well, the A&M's looking for somebody.

06:16.411 --> 06:19.556
I found Dr. Jag and talked to him and he said, we need to look at you.

06:19.656 --> 06:20.257
Come on down.

06:20.738 --> 06:22.000
And so that's arrangement.

06:22.781 --> 06:27.850
And I think there was one or two other people, but I never did ask and then inquire.

06:28.691 --> 06:31.155
This is the only dollar and cents question we're going to ask.

06:31.596 --> 06:33.279
What was the beginning salary offer?

06:33.299 --> 06:35.382
The beginning salary was

06:35.362 --> 06:37.888
Right at $7,000.

06:38.489 --> 06:39.191
For 12 months?

06:39.271 --> 06:39.752
12 months.

06:40.695 --> 06:41.657
I took a cut to come here.

06:42.319 --> 06:42.880
Really?

06:42.920 --> 06:47.370
Yeah, I was making $7,200 a year from the federal government at that time.

06:47.391 --> 06:49.075
And there were no moving expenses?

06:49.195 --> 06:50.939
No, no moving expenses.

06:50.959 --> 06:53.505
It was austere times.

06:53.485 --> 06:56.649
Just describe the move for you and your life.

06:57.109 --> 06:57.430
Okay.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.731
Well, we were in Kansas City.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.935
I was working for the government then, and the day we left there was snowing.

07:03.036 --> 07:05.579
It seemed like snow had something to do with it.

07:07.561 --> 07:17.012
It was kind of traumatic in a way because we had to go a long ways to go, and we had two children then, very young.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.344
It was a long trip, to put it mildly.

07:20.725 --> 07:21.607
No, I wasn't snowing that day.

07:21.627 --> 07:22.028
I'm sorry.

07:23.091 --> 07:25.577
That's when I, yeah, it was.

07:25.637 --> 07:26.079
It was November.

07:26.139 --> 07:26.680
It was snowing.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.745
I'm thinking about when we came out of the interview.

07:28.765 --> 07:31.553
It was snowing and it was the first part of November.

07:31.753 --> 07:33.297
It's going to be kind of bitter.

07:33.277 --> 07:37.945
Now, did you move the stuff yourself or did you have a commercial mover?

07:37.965 --> 07:39.367
We had the commercial mover that time.

07:39.688 --> 07:40.028
Okay.

07:41.190 --> 07:41.290
Yeah.

07:41.310 --> 07:46.238
We, when, after I got out of school and was in the government for a year, when I went to Tulane, we moved ourself.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.602
And that was, that was a, that was a disaster.

07:48.682 --> 07:51.186
So, we had a commercial mover, so.

07:51.207 --> 07:55.774
And what kind of accommodations did you find here for housing?

07:55.754 --> 08:02.649
We found a rental house on, gosh, I can't think of the name of it.

08:02.669 --> 08:07.399
It's over near Country Club.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.183
Near Briarcrest?

08:09.484 --> 08:12.671
Not near Briarcrest, the one where the student museum is now.

08:13.032 --> 08:15.417
I can't think of the name of it.

08:15.397 --> 08:22.388
We lived on Franklin Avenue, Franklin Street, Franklin Avenue, which is the next street over from College Avenue.

08:24.612 --> 08:26.134
The municipal golf course.

08:26.155 --> 08:27.096
The old municipal golf course.

08:27.116 --> 08:28.598
The old municipal golf course, just north of that.

08:29.941 --> 08:34.468
When he came here, Dr. Jagged lined us up with a real estate agent and

08:34.448 --> 08:40.539
And believe it or not, the people we rented from was a veterinarian.

08:42.001 --> 08:45.126
And gosh, I'm sorry, I can't think of her name.

08:45.928 --> 08:48.152
All right, Will, we can fill that in.

08:48.272 --> 08:50.135
She, he, they separated.

08:50.195 --> 08:51.758
He went to Arkansas and finally passed away.

08:52.239 --> 08:57.047
And she'd been working for, she just retired recently from Student Association.

08:57.027 --> 08:58.189
Olive de Lucia?

08:58.209 --> 08:59.712
Olive de Lucia, yeah.

09:00.213 --> 09:12.714
And we rented from them for about two years, and we bought a house on Oak Lawn, which is about, not too far from the campus, but in the general area, it's just north of campus, about four or five blocks.

09:12.754 --> 09:14.277
We lived there until 1970.

09:14.341 --> 09:22.619
All right, and as you compared with your experience before this, did housing seem inexpensive or what?

09:22.639 --> 09:26.006
It's probably about the same, probably about the same as where we're in Kansas City, yes.

09:26.227 --> 09:28.552
Right, so you began your duties officially.

09:28.672 --> 09:31.438
Martha would know exactly how much, but I did.

09:31.418 --> 09:32.179
Pardon?

09:32.279 --> 09:38.104
You began your duties with the College of Veterinary Medicine, or the School of Veterinary Medicine was then, officially at what time?

09:38.425 --> 09:40.126
November 16th, a Monday morning.

09:40.847 --> 09:41.348
In 1959?

09:41.368 --> 09:42.889
No, 1959.

09:43.870 --> 09:45.432
We got here Saturday night, so.

09:46.413 --> 09:47.393
And your title?

09:48.054 --> 09:48.995
Was assistant professor.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.357
Of public, veterinary public health?

09:51.377 --> 09:53.379
Veterinary public health at that time, right.

09:53.399 --> 09:53.660
All right.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.223
As far as you understood at that time, what were your duties?

09:58.047 --> 10:05.155
My duties were to teach, actually they had four courses in our department.

10:05.175 --> 10:07.839
I was supposed to teach the last three courses.

10:07.859 --> 10:08.960
We were going to develop a new course.

10:09.921 --> 10:12.624
We had two food safety courses, one in milk and one in meat.

10:12.644 --> 10:13.846
I was supposed to teach both of those.

10:14.527 --> 10:15.628
Those were my duties to begin with.

10:17.030 --> 10:22.216
And to develop a course in epidemiology, which there was not one in veterinary schools in the country at that time.

10:22.396 --> 10:25.860
So I developed that and started teaching that about two years later.

10:26.465 --> 10:36.593
summarize those courses to a non-well-informed... Well, they're both food safety courses.

10:37.265 --> 10:44.534
At that time, all veterinarians had a background in milk safety and meat hygiene, we called it.

10:45.355 --> 10:53.805
Milk safety was directed towards producing wholesome milk all the way from the cow to the bottle, so to speak.

10:55.267 --> 11:01.534
And it's not the best course in the world to teach, but I kind of enjoyed it.

11:01.514 --> 11:07.370
I actually had one textbook, the milk ordinance in cold, which is dry as, you know, as a desert.

11:08.072 --> 11:11.862
And so, but they had to know those because the students would be asked questions.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.301
on parts of that on their state licensing board.

11:15.321 --> 11:20.788
So it was a matter of they had to meet a certain competency, you might say, as far as knowledge.

11:22.591 --> 11:27.717
The meat inspection was another type of meat hygiene was similar.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.524
We had federal regulations that had to know all about how to do that.

11:33.865 --> 11:35.908
So it was a matter of teaching courses

11:35.888 --> 11:42.538
that the students, when they got out, if they did anything like that, they would know the regulations, know what was required of them and how to go through it.

11:43.379 --> 11:49.348
Along with the meat hygiene, we had an inspector with meat lab and I was, I did that.

11:49.969 --> 11:54.857
So, but I also took students with me and they would learn from the lab.

11:54.897 --> 11:55.818
Who were you replacing?

11:57.000 --> 11:57.821
Who had been doing this?

11:57.881 --> 11:58.643
No one had been doing that.

11:58.723 --> 11:59.704
Dr. Jaggi had been doing it.

11:59.724 --> 12:00.345
He'd been the only one.

12:00.365 --> 12:01.988
He was the only one in the department when I came here.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.191
So it was a new department.

12:04.171 --> 12:10.026
He was in microbiology, and then he was acting dean for a year, and then they created this new department.

12:10.066 --> 12:17.245
It's just been created that year, so I was the first person addition to department head.

12:17.465 --> 12:20.914
And the students took this what year in there?

12:20.894 --> 12:23.197
They took this their third year.

12:23.858 --> 12:24.218
Third year.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.806
Describe the students at that time as you saw them.

12:29.926 --> 12:33.270
What kind of, what did you think of the A&M students?

12:33.290 --> 12:36.555
Well, that particular time, the students were a little bit on the older side than they are now.

12:37.937 --> 12:38.437
Quite a bit older.

12:39.218 --> 12:42.042
But they were very dedicated.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.383
They were very serious.

12:44.585 --> 12:49.072
There was always a few that wouldn't do anything for us.

12:49.814 --> 12:55.303
And in fact, I guess I was one of the first people to flunk somebody in one of those courses.

12:55.343 --> 13:02.975
But I remember I had the meat hygiene course at 8 o'clock, three mornings a week if I remember correctly.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.858
And this one student was never there.

13:04.898 --> 13:07.422
He was there maybe a third of the time.

13:08.060 --> 13:10.202
And I always wondered, what about the 8 o'clock class?

13:10.242 --> 13:13.085
Found I never went to the 8 o'clock class.

13:13.105 --> 13:15.747
Yet he passed that.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.008
And he flunked my course.

13:17.249 --> 13:20.111
And I still remember how Price called me in and said, are you sure he flunked?

13:20.151 --> 13:22.173
I said, well, he was absent half the time.

13:22.253 --> 13:23.515
And then I gave frequent quizzes.

13:24.155 --> 13:24.896
Pop quiz, whatever.

13:24.916 --> 13:25.677
He always missed those.

13:25.697 --> 13:26.638
And we took major quizzes.

13:26.678 --> 13:28.219
He didn't make it.

13:28.239 --> 13:29.200
Well, he flunked out.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.403
And he was doing poorly in other courses, too, I found out.

13:32.483 --> 13:34.965
So that's my memory.

13:35.646 --> 13:37.628
Very few poor students.

13:38.063 --> 13:41.389
All right, now this was your first teaching assignment.

13:41.409 --> 13:41.669
Right, right.

13:41.689 --> 13:47.499
Describe some of the learning experiences you had as a new faculty member, pluses and minuses.

13:47.519 --> 13:48.360
Pluses and minuses.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.247
Well, that's a good question.

13:53.229 --> 13:56.494
The students made, some of them had very low grades.

13:57.942 --> 14:01.191
There's one person here on the faculty now that thanks me every now and then for passing him.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.173
I gave him a D minus.

14:04.118 --> 14:06.866
He said that's the worst grade I ever met, but he was so happy to get that D minus.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.673
He was really pleased.

14:11.172 --> 14:27.290
When I came here, because I was middle semester, I, Dr. Jaggi sent me over to San Antonio for three weeks to, to work with the, their milk hygiene sanitarians, go to the dairy farms, go to plants, so I got some on job training because I hadn't had that particular part.

14:27.971 --> 14:37.382
So that was a little bit hard to come on to as far as the learning the applications of it, but what, what, trying to think what it's supposed to say here.

14:37.801 --> 14:40.755
Well, some of your learning experiences as a teacher.

14:41.016 --> 14:42.965
Oh, it's very difficult.

14:43.528 --> 14:46.140
Personally, I mean first giving the exams.

14:46.627 --> 14:49.230
Dr. Jaggi gave horrible exams.

14:49.270 --> 14:50.652
He gave modified, true, false.

14:51.513 --> 14:53.175
And the students would come to me and complain about them.

14:53.235 --> 14:54.736
He taught infectious diseases.

14:55.637 --> 15:00.603
And he'd underline modifiers, you know, like most, mostly, seldom.

15:01.304 --> 15:07.371
And he may want, you know, mostly and it may be seldom in there, this type of thing.

15:07.451 --> 15:10.795
And this drove the students crazy.

15:11.315 --> 15:13.759
I've read a lot of books on taking exams.

15:13.799 --> 15:17.585
At that time, we weren't given much as far as assistance from the main campus.

15:18.106 --> 15:21.731
So it was a very hard learning experience to learn how to give exams.

15:21.751 --> 15:23.414
I still remember that, so.

15:23.434 --> 15:25.297
And how many were in this course?

15:25.317 --> 15:29.343
In the course, we started out with 64 students in the Vets of Tukul.

15:29.363 --> 15:33.289
And generally, by the time they got to 30 years, maybe 60, 58 or 60.

15:33.269 --> 15:34.951
So you had the entire class?

15:34.971 --> 15:36.493
Had the entire class, yes.

15:36.513 --> 15:37.414
In one section?

15:37.534 --> 15:38.295
One section, right.

15:38.315 --> 15:39.837
There were always one section at that time.

15:40.158 --> 15:44.383
And this was the way we normally identified a three-hour course?

15:44.403 --> 15:45.805
Yes, yeah.

15:45.825 --> 15:46.846
Was there also a lab?

15:47.727 --> 15:50.671
There was what we call duty groups now.

15:51.252 --> 15:53.294
And I said, this is only third year as far as a lecture.

15:53.394 --> 15:56.378
They'd have the lecture, three hours, each course a three-hour course.

15:56.398 --> 15:59.462
One in the fall, one in the spring.

15:59.442 --> 16:02.850
The lab was part of their senior year for their clinic groups.

16:02.971 --> 16:04.695
They had four weeks, five weeks at that time.

16:05.256 --> 16:11.712
And one five-week group, we'd split them between the poultry diagnostic lab and the meat lab.

16:11.772 --> 16:13.857
So I'd take them off to the meat lab and we'd do that.

16:14.815 --> 16:26.136
Did either Dr. Jaggi or Dean Price or anyone else give you any kind of directives or guidance or guidelines?

16:26.156 --> 16:26.216
No.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.921
No, there weren't any.

16:28.941 --> 16:29.603
No guidelines.

16:30.524 --> 16:30.725
All right.

16:30.745 --> 16:31.166
Just teach it.

16:31.426 --> 16:36.756
What did you assume, as you observed, might be some unspoken?

16:37.158 --> 16:39.340
or attitudes for that kind of fact?

16:39.360 --> 16:44.726
Well, the students are supposed to go to class, they're supposed to pass, and supposed to learn.

16:44.786 --> 16:49.792
And they learn to, to such a level they're competent enough to pass the state board.

16:49.812 --> 16:50.993
So that was the most embarrassing thing.

16:51.013 --> 16:53.776
We graduate them, give them a degree, and they flunk the state board.

16:53.836 --> 16:56.899
That was, that's pretty well spoken.

16:57.179 --> 17:03.987
Now, there wasn't any problem at that point about the low, a low pass rate or anything, was there?

17:04.007 --> 17:04.688
No, no, no.

17:04.828 --> 17:05.008
Okay.

17:05.068 --> 17:05.608
No, no, no.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.030
We never heard that.

17:07.010 --> 17:07.551
Yeah.

17:07.571 --> 17:08.992
They wanted to be sure that didn't occur.

17:09.072 --> 17:09.713
No, that didn't occur.

17:09.773 --> 17:15.158
No, it was purely up to your control and that time the students wouldn't complain.

17:15.298 --> 17:23.546
They were scared to death of some of our faculty members and I guess I just kind of looked into it because they didn't know where I came from or how I would react if they started complaining, so.

17:23.566 --> 17:26.729
Did you give them any guidelines, you know, your rules?

17:29.272 --> 17:31.154
Except, you know, I had to attend class.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.217
I expect to attend class and pass the quizzes.

17:34.277 --> 17:35.498
That's about all.

17:35.478 --> 17:36.359
I think anybody gave.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.921
And you didn't grade on the curve.

17:38.442 --> 17:39.864
No, no.

17:40.565 --> 17:50.099
Did, were there any, did any student come by to try to influence you or ask for anything special?

17:50.179 --> 17:54.565
I can never remember that, that earlier years, no.

17:54.585 --> 17:55.206
Okay.

17:55.226 --> 18:01.755
Describe these students at that time in the, we'll say in the early 60s,

18:02.427 --> 18:11.978
Describe the veterinary student body in terms of their background, their experience, their professional goals, and so forth.

18:12.319 --> 18:15.062
Most of them were older students at that time compared to nowadays.

18:15.082 --> 18:20.268
I mean, there were a few veterans in class, yeah.

18:20.549 --> 18:22.891
But had they been out of school and done something for a while?

18:22.911 --> 18:24.854
Yeah, a few of them had, yeah, a few of them, yeah.

18:24.874 --> 18:28.418
But overall, they seem to be more mature than now.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.562
Maybe I'm being unfair, but I didn't think about immaturity.

18:33.104 --> 18:37.589
They tend to work better together, more cohesive as a group.

18:38.830 --> 18:45.138
There's always some, you know, some wild ones, I mean, loose cannons.

18:45.899 --> 18:47.460
And they were pretty well, you knew them.

18:47.561 --> 18:51.385
The students kind of talked about them.

18:53.947 --> 18:59.755
We got to know them a little bit good because Dr. Jaggi, before I came here, had two field trips a year we went on.

19:00.696 --> 19:06.003
One was to Fort Worth, Dallas, to packing houses there because most of these students had never been in a slaughterhouse.

19:06.023 --> 19:08.726
So we'd spend three days up there, go up there and go through those.

19:08.746 --> 19:13.393
And the time you could do that for the students, they would, you get to know them fairly well.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.155
You get to know the goof-offs.

19:15.175 --> 19:17.558
You get to know the sincere ones.

19:17.538 --> 19:21.024
Most of them did have a kind of a real background, I would say.

19:21.044 --> 19:22.627
A large majority of them did.

19:24.049 --> 19:27.916
Also, the other trip we had was always a fun trip to go to the King Ranch.

19:28.296 --> 19:31.943
And I miss that one more than anything.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.125
I miss the other one.

19:33.145 --> 19:35.128
Go to King Ranch, and that was always a three day trip.

19:36.350 --> 19:38.714
And Dr. Jaggi, I'd drive.

19:39.556 --> 19:41.719
He never wanted to drive on that, so I'd drive him down there.

19:41.739 --> 19:43.242
And he always had a certain route he'd go.

19:43.475 --> 20:06.225
We always had to stop on the way and see one of the old, his old clinic instructor and we'd always have to stop at Rockdale to duck in, eat fish and we'd always stay at the same place, same hotel in Kingsville and then in the early

20:08.585 --> 20:12.491
mid-sixties I think it was, we had an Australian veterinarian here with us for a year.

20:13.692 --> 20:14.994
So we had to go down a day early.

20:15.075 --> 20:19.541
He was here for a sabbatical and was trying to learn all about our skills.

20:19.561 --> 20:22.485
He was an expert in sheep disease, but he ended up in our department.

20:23.527 --> 20:29.115
And so we went down a little bit early, went down a day early to show him Matamoros, towns down there.

20:29.716 --> 20:32.500
And I'll never forget, we went into the

20:33.627 --> 20:35.309
One of the bars down there, which is what it was.

20:36.410 --> 20:36.931
I can't remember.

20:37.011 --> 20:38.032
Yes Bar, something like that.

20:39.013 --> 20:42.577
I'd be doggone half the vet students were in that bar.

20:42.597 --> 20:51.047
So they always went down a little bit early and once some of them got in trouble and they had to keep them from getting in jail or put in jail.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.990
But anyway, it was kind of interesting running their students in the bar.

20:54.170 --> 20:57.955
But they knew how to have fun, I guess.

20:59.056 --> 21:02.740
Most of these veterinary students are,

21:03.260 --> 21:06.690
Were most of them planting large animal practices or?

21:07.091 --> 21:09.377
Mixed practices probably, most of them mixed practices.

21:09.397 --> 21:14.993
Now there's some small animal, but that particular time, small animal practices have not grown to the extent it has now.

21:15.153 --> 21:18.282
Now it's mostly all small animals, of course, the majority of it.

21:18.515 --> 21:24.683
Were, do you remember any of those first years who were kind of city slickers that really didn't know anything about animals?

21:25.183 --> 21:26.104
Yeah, there was a few in there.

21:26.144 --> 21:26.745
There were a few?

21:26.765 --> 21:28.687
Sure were, yeah, yeah, sure were.

21:29.408 --> 21:40.241
The, for you as a, as a Missourian, did you have any experiences of learning how Texans really operated?

21:40.402 --> 21:42.144
Oh yeah.

21:42.204 --> 21:43.065
Mention some of those.

21:43.525 --> 21:46.429
Well, gosh.

21:47.236 --> 21:48.638
No, of course the language a little bit.

21:48.678 --> 21:50.742
It took me a while to figure out what a bar ditch was.

21:51.523 --> 21:52.625
I kept looking for that bar.

21:52.705 --> 21:55.089
Okay.

21:55.109 --> 21:58.294
And just talking to students as far as some of the terminology is very difficult.

21:59.276 --> 22:07.569
And they like to have fun more than we did as a student I guess you'd say.

22:09.332 --> 22:13.058
We had field trips we took them out on when I started epidemiology.

22:13.038 --> 22:15.180
And we did through the diagnostic lab.

22:15.200 --> 22:20.005
They had a problem case, had, remember we had one, a bunch of calves dying from lead poisoning.

22:20.025 --> 22:24.989
We went out near Columbus and found it was, had drilling going on around there.

22:25.009 --> 22:26.711
We had some, found some pipe dope hiding lead.

22:26.751 --> 22:27.772
These calves were licking.

22:29.213 --> 22:36.240
One time on the way back, they, students had to stop and they, on one of the country roads, we took the shortest route back.

22:37.161 --> 22:40.564
And I thought they were getting out to, to relieve themselves.

22:40.544 --> 22:43.429
And next thing I know, they had about three watermelons in the back.

22:45.232 --> 22:47.857
So we had a watermelon party before we got home.

22:47.877 --> 22:54.188
So things like that, they kind of, they kind of come, get a little bit.

22:54.208 --> 23:01.460
And did, did ever have, did you ever have any experiences about how to pronounce certain Texas towns?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.123
Oh yeah, yeah.

23:03.143 --> 23:06.028
Mahea and Bexar County, it took a while.

23:06.008 --> 23:07.830
The worst one for me still is Elgin.

23:09.413 --> 23:16.402
And because I had one in the first class, I had a fellow named Charlie Graham from Elgin.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.524
And he was very outspoken.

23:17.804 --> 23:19.586
And I talked, oh, you're from Elgin.

23:19.646 --> 23:20.828
No, I'm not from Elgin.

23:20.848 --> 23:21.389
I'm from Elgin.

23:23.452 --> 23:24.473
You know what we're talking about?

23:24.959 --> 23:29.071
I know, it's something I guess like Palestine and Palestine.

23:29.091 --> 23:37.315
Elgin is on the way to Austin, just a little, and the first town this side of Elgin is M-C-D-A-D-E.

23:37.666 --> 23:44.954
and that's MacDade, not McDade, MacDade.

23:45.015 --> 23:46.937
You know, every state has some of those.

23:46.977 --> 23:50.861
They catch me on it in class, you know, if I mention some town and they say, where's that?

23:51.282 --> 23:52.423
That's right down the road here.

23:53.344 --> 23:54.526
They have Kentucky's Versailles.

23:54.546 --> 23:54.966
There you go.

23:54.986 --> 23:55.727
It's Versailles.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.589
Versailles, yeah, yeah.

23:58.110 --> 24:06.880
Did you run into any, and this one I'm asking a blank question, are there any veterinary terms that are uniquely Texan?

24:09.627 --> 24:12.532
There are Haskell and I can't think of them offhand.

24:12.632 --> 24:14.416
I can't think of any, but there are.

24:14.656 --> 24:15.578
Barditch.

24:15.598 --> 24:17.702
Yeah, Barditch.

24:17.722 --> 24:21.709
I've never heard that anywhere else in Barditch.

24:22.871 --> 24:30.184
When did you begin to feel that you were a part of the group?

24:32.324 --> 24:34.030
It took quite a while, really.

24:35.855 --> 24:40.531
I don't know how to put this, but when we came, there's three of us came at the same time.

24:41.032 --> 24:45.928
Arden Kimler, if you remember him, Anatomy, and Charlie Hall for Microbiology.

24:46.870 --> 24:50.373
Actually, he came out a little bit later than we did.

24:50.393 --> 24:55.879
But Arden Kimler and John Ramsey and I all came that same fall.

24:57.020 --> 25:04.507
And we kind of felt like we were kind of lone rangers in a way because everybody else in the factory was an A&M graduate.

25:04.708 --> 25:06.069
Was it literally everybody?

25:06.089 --> 25:06.850
Everybody, yeah.

25:06.870 --> 25:07.430
Is that right?

25:07.450 --> 25:07.690
Yeah, yeah.

25:07.710 --> 25:15.358
In fact, they were in, you know, AVMA has an accreditation program and that year A&M was,

25:16.537 --> 25:27.719
evaluated and they said you're inbreeding too much, all your faculty members need to get so many, you know, in the future, the next three years have to be from outside, no more A&M graduates.

25:27.739 --> 25:34.613
So we were, at fall we came in, all three of us, as a result of, and I think some of them kind of resented that because they thought, well,

25:35.065 --> 25:35.827
Those aren't Aggies.

25:35.847 --> 25:38.915
So he kind of felt that in a way, yeah.

25:39.376 --> 25:42.845
Describe the dean of veterinary medicine at that time.

25:43.326 --> 25:46.253
Your first impression and then take us on through.

25:46.293 --> 25:48.619
First impression of the dean?

25:50.000 --> 25:55.069
Remind me of a very straight-laced Baptist preacher.

25:57.213 --> 26:01.901
Very meticulous, very careful what he said, and what he wrote was very outstanding.

26:02.482 --> 26:06.128
But he was very, very, he knew where you stood.

26:08.232 --> 26:12.700
I was told, you know, you wear a shirt and tie every day, no boots, no beard.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.702
No mustache, clean shaven.

26:16.884 --> 26:17.685
He said those things?

26:17.705 --> 26:19.027
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:19.047 --> 26:21.349
He had to be known and you knew you were going to do that.

26:21.850 --> 26:22.570
Yeah.

26:22.590 --> 26:23.451
Shirt and tie every day.

26:23.672 --> 26:25.313
Coat and tie if you don't need to be.

26:25.934 --> 26:26.475
And no boots.

26:26.495 --> 26:30.419
He was very much against wearing boots or wearing a beard or anything.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.102
What about hours to be here?

26:34.103 --> 26:36.325
Eight, you have eight hours a day at least, yeah, yeah.

26:36.305 --> 26:37.406
You didn't come and go.

26:37.446 --> 26:39.969
You knew you had to be here 8 o'clock.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.511
I mean, that's pretty well steady.

26:41.731 --> 26:42.572
What about Saturdays?

26:44.014 --> 26:44.474
Saturdays?

26:46.116 --> 26:47.638
Nothing about Saturdays, no, no.

26:47.658 --> 26:49.320
Didn't have anything about Saturdays, yeah.

26:49.340 --> 26:50.641
So you all didn't have Saturday classes?

26:50.661 --> 26:50.841
No.

26:51.062 --> 26:51.342
I see.

26:51.402 --> 26:52.163
Over, we did.

26:52.383 --> 26:52.483
Yeah.

26:52.663 --> 26:53.945
Remember Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

26:54.025 --> 26:56.428
Yeah, that's kind of a relief because I went out to school in Missouri.

26:56.468 --> 26:59.511
We had Saturday, all Saturday morning we had class.

26:59.491 --> 27:02.516
And Dean Price set the example, though.

27:02.716 --> 27:03.157
Oh, he did.

27:03.217 --> 27:03.818
Definitely.

27:03.838 --> 27:04.739
Yeah, definitely.

27:06.121 --> 27:06.221
Yeah.

27:06.242 --> 27:09.386
Now, was he called Slick Owl already by the time?

27:09.426 --> 27:10.909
Yeah, he was Slick Owl.

27:11.269 --> 27:11.810
Why that?

27:12.371 --> 27:17.599
I think because his hair was combed back slick and he's a pretty smooth tongue, too.

27:18.080 --> 27:22.307
He wasn't devious, but very, very smooth tongue.

27:22.427 --> 27:23.929
Very sharp, really.

27:23.909 --> 27:27.876
Who were some of the other key people when you arrived?

27:28.438 --> 27:41.201
Other key material, John Miller from Anatomy was, and he held kind of a very elevated position because Al Price was in his department and he deserved it.

27:42.504 --> 27:46.812
Of course, Dr. Jaggi was Aggie Jaggi and here I was in that department.

27:47.264 --> 27:48.727
J-A-G-G-E?

27:48.967 --> 27:51.212
J-A-G-G-I, yeah.

27:51.292 --> 27:52.174
J-A-G-G-G-I.

27:52.194 --> 27:52.534
J-A-G-G-I, yeah.

27:52.594 --> 27:54.358
Very fine person, Creed Meany.

27:54.378 --> 27:54.639
Nice.

27:55.039 --> 27:57.344
But he's very, very conservative.

27:57.364 --> 28:02.033
I remember that.

28:03.785 --> 28:05.888
Very set in his ways, the way he did things.

28:06.690 --> 28:10.536
He wasn't about to change his exam methods or his lecturing.

28:10.656 --> 28:11.437
They learned the book.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.118
He read it to them.

28:13.801 --> 28:14.222
Textbook.

28:15.163 --> 28:18.669
Of course, there were some real characters.

28:18.889 --> 28:19.971
Pappy Burns.

28:20.322 --> 28:22.144
in Physiology and Pharmacology.

28:22.164 --> 28:23.385
You say Pappy or Happy?

28:23.686 --> 28:24.166
Pappy.

28:24.206 --> 28:24.727
Pappy.

28:24.747 --> 28:25.548
Pat Burns was the name.

28:25.608 --> 28:27.710
Everybody called him Pappy.

28:28.751 --> 28:33.516
We eventually, a few years later, we started the comprehensive exam after their second year.

28:34.858 --> 28:42.526
And that's when I found out that you, students learned in this class your eyes stayed on your paper because he would pull up, he jerked the paper wave.

28:42.566 --> 28:43.988
He saw their eyes winding around it.

28:44.068 --> 28:47.832
They didn't, didn't even come close to,

28:47.812 --> 28:48.513
Cheating.

28:49.435 --> 28:52.420
One of the real characters, of course, Dick Turk.

28:54.103 --> 28:55.486
You remember him, I'm sure.

28:56.127 --> 28:57.069
Did he have a nickname?

28:58.111 --> 29:00.375
Not that I know of.

29:00.395 --> 29:00.916
I never heard.

29:00.936 --> 29:02.158
I can't remember him.

29:03.961 --> 29:13.575
One story about Dr. Turk, I remember he was very hard of hearing when I came here and, but he could lip read very well and the students found that out.

29:14.737 --> 29:20.025
But unknowing to anybody, they didn't, well, I don't think anybody knew it.

29:20.626 --> 29:24.231
He had some surgical procedures done which he recovered his hearing.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.118
And he didn't tell anybody for three weeks.

29:27.138 --> 29:34.119
I still remember we were walking up the stairways from second to third floor one day, his office on the third floor, and somebody behind me started talking about him.

29:35.102 --> 29:36.305
And I guess he couldn't resist anymore.

29:36.325 --> 29:38.271
He turned around and said, no, that's not true.

29:38.740 --> 29:40.363
And they were dumbfounded.

29:40.543 --> 29:42.967
That's the first time we knew he could hear.

29:43.788 --> 29:44.850
And what was his specialty?

29:45.351 --> 29:45.972
Peristology.

29:46.072 --> 29:46.453
Peristology.

29:46.473 --> 29:48.436
And he's well known throughout the country for it, yeah.

29:48.456 --> 29:48.796
Very good.

29:48.816 --> 29:49.117
All right.

29:49.297 --> 29:49.798
Who else?

29:51.761 --> 29:52.943
Of course, we had the clinic.

29:53.905 --> 29:55.648
Gosh, stop and think.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.689
Had Dr. Romain there.

29:56.729 --> 30:04.562
Gosh, Dr. Callahan.

30:06.331 --> 30:08.456
And he was already Nigg in nickname?

30:08.657 --> 30:11.063
Yeah, already Nigg in nickname, yeah.

30:11.965 --> 30:18.602
Who, before you came here, who did you know by reputation?

30:20.337 --> 30:21.138
My reputation.

30:21.458 --> 30:23.060
Who was there that was best?

30:23.080 --> 30:24.201
Probably Turk, probably knew him.

30:24.221 --> 30:24.902
Dr. Turk?

30:25.002 --> 30:26.624
Yeah, probably knew him best of all.

30:27.285 --> 30:30.769
And what kind of reputation did the A&M?

30:31.390 --> 30:37.457
It had a good reputation for particularly food animal medicine.

30:37.477 --> 30:37.997
Yeah, very good.

30:39.039 --> 30:42.603
I should say, I've heard of Dr. Beamer who was over at Spongebob Clinic.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.245
He's well known, Rusty Beamer.

30:44.285 --> 30:47.188
And he died soon after I came here, not too long after that.

30:47.995 --> 30:51.541
Were there many other young people on the faculty?

30:51.561 --> 30:52.362
Not many, no.

30:52.583 --> 30:53.184
Not many at all.

30:53.725 --> 30:56.169
The, I remember Gene Gowron was fairly young then.

30:57.411 --> 31:03.001
John Huff was over in the, over in the, oh, it was an antiplasmosis lab.

31:03.361 --> 31:09.632
Used to be the old creamery over here before they had a circle over there, that thing.

31:10.777 --> 31:16.045
Describe the veterinary facilities in the early 60s.

31:16.445 --> 31:18.368
Early 60s, they were fairly austere.

31:18.428 --> 31:25.819
I didn't have a desk my first, or have an office my first, that's about the first six months.

31:26.661 --> 31:31.047
They gave me a chair in a laboratory.
