00:03.372 --> 00:06.395
There's always that. In any organization, you 
have that problem. But anyway, you wanted to go

00:09.298 --> 00:15.003
back to the origination of what the conference 
was. How about your getting up to Texas A&M, if you

00:15.023 --> 00:17.085
don't mind? How did that happen? Well, I'll tell 
you how it happened. My mother wanted me to become a

00:22.130 --> 00:24.072
doctor. So my mother died early. But anyway, I had 
planned on going to Rice. So I was there. Accepted

00:32.735 --> 00:33.616
at Rice. But that summer, I went over to Louisiana 
to work in oil fields. Where did you work in

00:39.626 --> 00:40.948
Louisiana? I worked in Vinton, Louisiana, in some 
little wells my brother had, Johnny had. And then I

00:46.557 --> 00:50.243
decided I wanted to become a program engineering 
geologist. So then I changed. Instead of going to

00:51.766 --> 00:54.490
Rice, I registered at A&M. and started to take a 
program in engineering and geology. And that's

00:57.142 --> 00:58.564
how I came to A&M. Had the brother been there or 
anyone in the family at all? Johnny was a graduate

01:00.506 --> 01:02.948
of A&M and so was my older brother. He had gone for a 
year and then went over to Texas. And Johnny was a

01:05.731 --> 01:08.855
chemical engineer graduate of A&M. He was about 
seven years my senior. He worked for Exxon. Then he

01:11.898 --> 01:14.881
was out busy drilling a few little wells, working 
over wells. He left Exxon by the time I was a senior

01:14.901 --> 01:18.345
in high school. And that summer before school 
started, the university started, and I went

01:19.005 --> 01:23.110
there. I'd gone back to... to my school at 
Galveston, even after I graduated a year because I

01:24.878 --> 01:37.919
was too young, too small, and I had to take a third 
year of Latin to be able to qualify for taking

01:24.878 --> 01:37.919
pre-med or whatever to go to Rice. So I went back. 
But I was now taking also trigonometry and solid

01:39.041 --> 01:42.627
geometry. So I did so well in those, I decided I'd be 
an engineer and geologist when I decided to get

01:42.647 --> 01:48.256
into oil and gas. Brother did straight geology. 
Did you ride the train up to College Station, or how

01:49.870 --> 01:53.033
did you go? Yeah, I rode the train when I went to 
College Station, and I may have heard it because

01:53.053 --> 02:09.591
when I talked to the, I think to one of the 
graduation things at A&M, I'd mentioned that when

01:53.053 --> 02:09.591
I got off the train, because my aunt put me on the 
train in Houston. She drove up from Galveston, put

02:09.832 --> 02:11.533
me on the train. I drove up, and I had to get off all 
alone, 16-year-old kid, Walking across the

02:16.263 --> 02:18.366
campus, wondering what the hell was going to 
happen. It was a long walk, huh? A long walk. Up that

02:20.189 --> 02:20.449
hill. You know, from the old train station over to 
campus there. But it was a very nostalgic memory.

02:25.136 --> 02:26.778
But anyway, A&M was a great school. And, you know, 
for $450 a year, I could go to school in a room and

02:27.018 --> 02:31.164
board and everything. And it was tough. And my 
father didn't have any money. I'd have to do some

02:33.908 --> 02:36.392
work in the mess hall. And I built bookshelves. And 
I was cleaning and pressing laundry. And I had a

02:41.119 --> 02:45.645
candy concession where the damn football players 
would steal all the time and not pay me. And then I

02:46.638 --> 02:51.623
did, it was tough the first couple of years, but I 
managed to get by. And the last year, I made money. I

02:53.966 --> 02:57.290
made more money when I graduated than I got from 
Amical when I went to work for them. I developed, I

02:58.391 --> 03:07.841
was the one who originated the stationery that had 
its beautiful gold and embossed field artillery

02:58.391 --> 03:07.841
and signal corps. I originated that. In fact, 
there's some sheets of that in the archives. It

03:10.344 --> 03:13.708
used to be just plain print, maroon print on the 
white paper. So I got a San Antonio printer. who

03:16.304 --> 03:19.527
developed that for me, and then I had an agent in 
every dormitory. And I was making $300 a month when

03:19.887 --> 03:25.152
I got it from school, and I only took a $126 salary at 
A&M University. I mean, at Amical University,

03:25.292 --> 03:28.775
Amical, in South Louisiana. So I took a cut in 
salary to leave A&M. But that, I wanted to take

03:32.619 --> 03:35.922
engineering, and I didn't want to go in the Army. I 
knew the war was coming on. We all knew that, but I

03:38.705 --> 03:41.988
wanted to get some experience. So what I decided, 
even though I was offered a full commission

03:42.008 --> 03:45.771
because... I had excellent grades, and I was in 
battalion command and everything at A&M, but I

03:46.240 --> 03:52.428
didn't want to get in the service. The war hadn't 
come on. But I was a reserve officer, and then when I

03:54.831 --> 04:02.301
was in South Louisiana, I think it was September 
before the war, they called me to active duty. I

04:03.643 --> 04:12.214
went with the Corps of Engineers, and I did all 
construction on Dixon Gun Plant, Sergeant Ernest

04:03.643 --> 04:12.214
Depot, all these airfields around Texas here. 
with the Corps of Engineers. So I got tremendous

04:14.314 --> 04:15.876
experience. I ended up first lieutenant, 
supervising 150 people. And you were mainly

04:20.641 --> 04:22.083
involved in construction. Mainly engineering 
and construction. Engineering officer, what I

04:24.806 --> 04:26.888
was, assistant engineering officer. And 
therefore, I got great experience. And then when

04:30.092 --> 04:33.576
the war ended, I lost four and a half years. So I just 
came to Houston and decided, to hell with it. I lost

04:36.640 --> 04:42.066
all my contemporaries that stayed with the 
company for some reason or other because of being

04:42.670 --> 04:44.032
classified as 4F. They had come up, and they ranked 
pretty well in the company. And the company

04:46.937 --> 04:50.502
offered me a job, because they thought I was a good 
engineering geologist. And I had been involved in

04:51.363 --> 04:55.610
South Louisiana, which was a tremendous field for 
Amaco. It was called Stanley in the old days,

04:55.630 --> 04:57.974
Stanley Oil and Gas. And they had a tremendous 
operation there. And I had a lot of experience in

05:01.199 --> 05:04.003
the year and a half that I was down. So therefore, I 
came to Houston and said, this is where I want to set

05:04.895 --> 05:08.119
up and become a consultant. Were you in 
production, primarily, or exploration? I was in

05:09.902 --> 05:12.505
exploration, geology, and production. They had 
exploitation engineers, you see. And we did all

05:15.249 --> 05:17.051
the exploitation. And we didn't do the basic 
regional geology. We did the exploitation

05:24.000 --> 05:27.585
geology and engineering, too. So I did both, 
because my background was both. And therefore,

05:30.649 --> 05:33.012
when I came to Houston, My brother had come here 
also, and he had some friends. And I was able to get

05:36.268 --> 05:44.275
six people to fund me $50 each with a little 
override to see if I could find oil and gas for them.

05:44.395 --> 05:45.416
And that was it. And I would do the deals. I'd do the 
geology and engineering, and then I'd get my

05:49.600 --> 05:52.963
brother and my partner. That's all we had, one girl 
in the office with us. They'd go down to Esperson

05:55.425 --> 05:58.708
Drugstore and sell the deals. Were you doing any 
seismograph work, or how were you doing? No, I

06:01.751 --> 06:03.893
would do subsurface geology. In fact, when it 
first started, we had so little money. None of you

06:08.001 --> 06:09.303
may have heard this before. I had a friend called 
John Todd who had a Cambie blueprint, and I

06:10.204 --> 06:14.448
couldn't afford to buy the logs. So I'd borrow the 
logs at 6 o'clock. I'd work about 3 in the morning,

06:19.594 --> 06:22.678
and I'd bring them back for 8 o'clock. He wouldn't 
charge me. And I'd do some of my geology to start

06:23.959 --> 06:26.202
with, you see. So that's the way. And then we would 
get people at Bacchus for 32nd overriding

06:27.475 --> 06:31.259
interest. Eventually, we'd get more. And 
eventually, we'd get a quarter in that front. We'd

06:34.643 --> 06:36.605
get big people like Bob Smith. And we had all the 
Jewish people in town taking deals for us called

06:36.625 --> 06:40.770
the Big Nine. Oh, they were good, too. Wine 
Gardens, all the Jewish people that you know, the

06:42.672 --> 06:47.678
Battlesteins, they're all to Oshkosh. And you 
were working this area primarily? We were working

06:49.260 --> 06:51.703
the Gulf Coast region here. Except that we did work 
some areas, just like our North Texas prospect

06:51.723 --> 06:56.188
came to us from a Chicago bookie, believe it or not, 
through one of my partners. That's a hell of a story

07:01.228 --> 07:03.591
in itself. But he asked me to check, and I said, 
hell, what the hell does a Chicago bookie know

07:03.611 --> 07:09.159
about Texas Auto and Gas? He just had a deal, and I 
found out it came to him through one of my friends

07:09.899 --> 07:15.106
been trying to sell it, named Allison Miles. I 
didn't know him, but he had gone to A&M. Had been

07:18.190 --> 07:19.892
trying for two years to sell the deal. He couldn't 
sell it to the Chicago bookie. He wanted to know if

07:21.695 --> 07:23.577
we'd look at it. One of my participants called him, 
General Pulaski. He wasn't a general, but they

07:26.076 --> 07:27.298
called him that. He said, come on, you've got to 
look at this deal. I said, well, all right,

07:29.261 --> 07:30.423
General, I'll look at it. And that's where we made 
one of the big discoveries on the Texas. So you

07:33.088 --> 07:34.250
never know. No, you don't. But anyway. Did you ever 
read that book about Petillo Higgins? No, I

07:40.159 --> 07:41.922
haven't seen that book there. I haven't read that 
one. It's quite a story. Did you ever know him? No, I

07:45.528 --> 07:47.151
know of him, but I don't know him. Do you have the 
book? David Norton was going to give it to you. I

07:50.184 --> 07:51.005
think I have the book. I think you really enjoyed 
that. Higgins did a great job on Spinal Tap.

07:54.830 --> 07:55.691
There's no question. Quite an adventurer. Well, 
oil and gas are that way. A lot of these people are

07:58.014 --> 07:59.256
that way. But the oil and gas was good. We began 
slowly, and we kept getting a little better and

08:01.499 --> 08:05.283
better interest in it. We found a lot of oil and gas. 
I did consulting work for Glenn McCarthy and a lot

08:06.305 --> 08:09.589
of other people. Eddie Scurll, I'm glad, the 
old-timers you've heard of. Floyd Carsten and

08:13.855 --> 08:17.239
them, besides creating our own company. I was 
doing both things. The consulting work, I'd do,

08:19.519 --> 08:23.224
and I'd sell deals to them, make a little override 
there. But we began to build our company. That's

08:25.027 --> 08:27.711
where we really started our company. So most of the 
oil and gas we had, we found most of it ourselves. So

08:30.495 --> 08:32.498
that's the difference where we're at than most 
companies. When did you organize? What was your

08:34.882 --> 08:37.886
first company organized as, or when did you do 
that? It was organized in 1946. That's when I came

08:39.489 --> 08:41.412
in January of 46. It was organized probably in June 
of 46. So you organized right away. You and I just

08:43.595 --> 08:44.276
consulted. It was organized as Rock Soil. And 
Rob's got some history on that. He's got some

08:48.340 --> 08:49.442
history on that. In 46, and they had three 
partners, and one guy named Jimmy Gray, after he

08:49.922 --> 08:58.853
was in about six months, I was getting a little 
overhyped for doing the work for them. He said, I

08:59.434 --> 09:01.677
got a third interest. I'm going to Oklahoma. I'm 
leaving. Do you want to buy it? So I got the

09:04.200 --> 09:07.403
gentleman to back my note for $9,000. And he had a 
little money in, so I bought him out for the third of

09:07.423 --> 09:12.730
this little fledgling company that just started. 
I think we had one well at Kaplan and one well at

09:13.411 --> 09:16.234
North Kiran. So I bought my interest in it, and the 
general helped me bank it. He signed my note for me.

09:21.906 --> 09:22.847
So General Pulaski. But that's how I got in the 
company. Then, of course, we started building the

09:24.830 --> 09:26.432
company. In the meantime, I was also doing 
consulting work for a number of people around here

09:26.452 --> 09:34.021
that would pay me enough, because I had two kids 
here and one on the way. In other words, it's very,

09:35.523 --> 09:43.773
and I get that a little naive, to think that with a 
year and a half experience, I could become a

09:35.523 --> 09:43.773
consulting engineer and geologist. And that's 
what I did. That's what you really did, yeah. But I

09:47.112 --> 09:50.435
knew Houston was the place to be, so that's one 
thing I picked the right place to be. That's when

09:50.976 --> 09:53.739
things were taking over. There was a backlog of 
prospects that couldn't drill wells during the

09:53.759 --> 09:59.925
war because steel was unavailable. We were 
furnishing all our allies with all the oil that

09:59.945 --> 10:02.348
they had. And therefore, I knew that Houston was 
the place to be. Then when did you organize

10:09.595 --> 10:12.138
Mitchell Energy Development? Well, after the 
oil, rock soil, then we created a company called I

10:17.453 --> 10:23.378
think it's Christie, Mitchell, and Mitchell, 
which is a successor to Rock Soil. And that was the

10:24.139 --> 10:27.622
three partners, myself and my brother Johnny. 
They were older than I was. And myself. They would

10:29.944 --> 10:32.867
outsell the deals I'd do with the children in 
engineering. And we finally hired a couple of

10:32.887 --> 10:37.371
people to help us because we taught drilling 
wells, making a few wells. And I would say we

10:38.412 --> 10:47.140
organized that probably in the early 50 or 51, 
Christie, Mitchell, and Mitchell. And then we

10:48.082 --> 10:54.470
started making a lot of discoveries with Palacios 
and North Texas in 53. And we've discovered a lot of

10:54.550 --> 10:58.195
oil and gas reservoirs and fields. And then we 
changed it to George Mitchell Associates. And

11:04.262 --> 11:08.027
then in 72, we became Mitchell Engine Development 
when we went public. That's when I first met Joe.

11:10.169 --> 11:15.456
And when I went to Chicago to make presentations 
to, he's working with Hershey, Rodman, and Druck.

11:16.060 --> 11:20.426
to see if they thought that we could sell our 
product to the investment community. You know,

11:21.488 --> 11:23.892
whether they thought we had enough, whatever it 
was. And they thought, you know, they helped us get

11:24.573 --> 11:28.358
the information around the country. So that when 
we went public, the stock sold when it was sold. Oh,

11:33.205 --> 11:36.430
probably a third of the company, that's all that 
was sold down, more than that. And my brother, I had

11:37.171 --> 11:42.339
bought out most of his, and then I bought out my 
other partner before that. My brother had about

11:43.300 --> 11:45.223
20% of the company I had. more than that. And he 
eventually sold most of his and did other things.

11:50.282 --> 11:55.406
So then I ended up with most of the company, 
probably 63%. What was your first experience in

11:55.426 --> 11:57.388
real estate? Well, the first experience was very 
interesting. First experience was, I guess, back

12:01.812 --> 12:08.537
in 1961

12:01.812 --> 12:08.537
or two. Someone, a person in Galveston I knew named 
Spro, a woman, called me and said, I knew him in high

12:16.118 --> 12:28.181
school, George, that my husband who just died left 
some real estate to the Texas bank. We used to be in a

12:28.221 --> 12:33.672
Texas bank down here where the Chronicle building 
was.

12:46.004 --> 12:48.988
Some husband, wasn't it? Society for the 
Prevention of Frailty of Animals, yeah. She could

12:51.892 --> 12:57.661
get the income, but then the property would go to 
the dogs, so to speak. She said, they're getting

12:59.163 --> 13:04.411
ready to sell these people, and they really got a 
rip-off going on. And they got a piece out of the

13:04.431 --> 13:09.598
memorial where those apartments are right there, 
and then they had a piece... which is now an

13:10.743 --> 13:12.865
industrial park of the Woodlands. That was before 
we even conceded the Woodlands. Now, what year is

13:14.627 --> 13:15.728
this, roughly? That was about 61 or 62. And so I 
found out that the district judge in Conroe had

13:18.270 --> 13:28.801
some sort, or at least where the trust head 
department had to go, had a deal going on. So I

13:28.821 --> 13:34.346
threatened the bank with a lawsuit for her 
benefit, and that if I got it, I'd get a quarter of

13:28.821 --> 13:34.346
their profits. And therefore, this land was split 
up. The judge worked out a deal. that he would take

13:38.333 --> 13:46.125
part of Deer Conroe and let us have 500 acres on the 
edge of the well before he even didn't think it'd be

13:38.333 --> 13:46.125
part of the woods. Had nothing to do with the woods. 
For $49 an acre. And it had about a $50 acre of timber

13:50.471 --> 13:52.214
on it. So we were able to buy it that way. Now that is 
the first piece of real estate we had taken on. We

14:03.791 --> 14:04.813
had done some doing with some housing development 
with a person named Norman Dobbins back in 63, 64,

14:05.502 --> 14:17.655
doing a little housing development in several 
spots around the country, which we didn't make

14:05.502 --> 14:17.655
money. We lost money on that. This was strictly as 
an investment thing? Well, we were participating

14:21.239 --> 14:24.623
with him trying to help make it work. He was pretty 
good at design and creativity, but he was a very

14:24.703 --> 14:29.168
poor businessman. So we had to And we lost money on 
that, and we finally had to buy him out. But that

14:34.022 --> 14:35.263
wasn't very much money. We were just playing with 
it. We didn't do it. But about 62, 63, 64, then we had

14:38.367 --> 14:44.914
bought Pelican Island about in 62 or 63. We worked 
with A&M to take the A&M campus. We had looked at it.

14:50.741 --> 14:54.185
But then I got in real estate that way because we 
were using leverage and all of that. Pelican

14:55.667 --> 14:58.510
Island, I had a deal made buying it from, Mary 
Chapman Scott, they had about $10 million spent in

14:58.912 --> 15:01.995
it. And they had a big lawsuit with the city. I was 
able to solve the lawsuit, so I bought it for $1.8

15:04.057 --> 15:06.279
million. But I had a deal with Shell to sell 50 acres 
for about $1.6 million. So then I closed the deal. I

15:11.444 --> 15:11.824
sold it. And I had $200,000 or $300,000 left in 
Pelican Island. Then I promised to give A&M the

15:15.087 --> 15:22.454
acres they had, the 100 acres they had for the 
institute there. So then, of course, what got me

15:22.474 --> 15:27.619
into really the woodlands It was about that time, 
in 64, we'd have more oil. And this is all you had

15:30.671 --> 15:33.815
done, though, in terms of land and development? We 
knew in 62 that energy was in trouble. I knew in 62

15:39.020 --> 15:50.792
that that's when they opened the floodgates and 
all the Persian Gulf oil, Kuwait and Iran, and they

15:39.020 --> 15:50.792
were driving us up a wall and importing oil. And the 
price of oil was down to a quarter barrel. And I

15:53.996 --> 15:58.180
could foresee, and that Laubel Railroad 
Commission of Texas was only eight days for every

15:53.996 --> 15:58.180
oil well. So we concentrated on gas because we knew 
gas was going to be the future. So I concentrated

16:04.142 --> 16:05.684
all our effort on gas. And knowing that unless we 
did something else, we would probably be out of

16:06.825 --> 16:15.695
business because we could see oil was going to be in 
deep trouble as long as it continued flooding this

16:06.825 --> 16:15.695
country with cheap oil. But you were discovering, 
but you weren't trying to produce the gas. We were

16:18.237 --> 16:18.698
discovering. We were producing. Oh, yeah, we 
produced every foot we could get at $0.03 a

16:19.659 --> 16:22.502
thousand. The first gas contract I made was $0.03 a 
thousand at North Huron. And then it finally got up

16:27.860 --> 16:30.624
to six or eight cents. That was a pretty good price 
then. But we knew that gas was undervalued and we

16:32.548 --> 16:41.161
could make deals with major companies to drill gas 
properties easier than you could for oil

16:32.548 --> 16:41.161
properties. So I thought gas was the future from 
the standpoint of energy demand. And we

16:45.829 --> 16:48.173
concentrated 80% of everything related to gas. So 
we knew that. So then I started working on some of

16:50.977 --> 16:54.002
our, brokers they're out with all these brokers 
working for us you know 10 or 15 people they make it

16:55.096 --> 17:24.917
if they make a deal they make a dollar they don't 
make a deal with no money so they're starving to

16:55.096 --> 17:24.917
death so i said well if you find a piece of real 
estate up here you know where we can steal you know

16:55.096 --> 17:24.917
we'll may try to figure out how to leverage 
ourselves and buy it so when i had this piece of land

16:55.096 --> 17:24.917
that i bought from the judge and the bank here that i 
end up with that three or four acres out there i had

16:55.096 --> 17:24.917
this um person that um Max Newland, who was a 
forester up in that area, to cut the timber so we

17:25.184 --> 17:32.533
could get some money. So he cut the timber on that 
land, and I said, well, Max, if you know of a deal

17:33.914 --> 17:46.890
that we could put together, leverage-wise, and 
make a real good deal, because we don't have any

17:33.914 --> 17:46.890
money, we have to use leverage, see what you can put 
together. So he came in one day and he said, I'll

17:46.910 --> 17:52.677
tell you what, there's a 50,000-acre block up here 
called the Grogan, Cork, and Lumber Company. So

17:55.289 --> 17:56.431
that may be possible. And David Bentley, 
everybody had been trying to buy it for five years.

18:00.036 --> 18:02.239
And the problem was they had three family groups. 
They were down to cousins. The brothers had died

18:03.821 --> 18:05.043
off. They had a big lumber mill that had burned 
down, and they rebuilt it the same old-fashioned

18:05.924 --> 18:12.954
way, which was not efficient. They were in 
trouble. They had 80 heirs, some of them worth

18:15.077 --> 18:20.605
several hundred thousand dollars, couldn't 
afford a pack of cigarettes. And therefore, I

18:21.614 --> 18:24.217
said, all right, let me see if I can't put this 
together. So it took me two years and 62 or so to buy

18:24.318 --> 18:30.786
the Grogan-Cocker-Lummet coming. I had to settle 
those three lawsuits. I'm in three family groups

18:32.168 --> 18:33.970
fighting. And I bought it for $125.25 an acre, 
50,000 acres, of which only 4,000 were woodlands,

18:34.731 --> 18:41.640
and the rest were scattered in the county. And the 
reason that the way I figured the price, that I

18:42.762 --> 18:50.372
could sell the timber to Louisiana Pacific, and I 
had some minerals, So I figured the only thing I

18:50.858 --> 19:01.897
could afford to pay would be $125 an acre, or about 
$6 million for 50,000 acres, because I could pay

18:50.858 --> 19:01.897
the interest on the Louisiana timber contract and 
the minerals. And I got the Bank of Southwest at

19:02.979 --> 19:06.004
that time. Harold Vance used to be my professor at 
A&M, thought a lot of me. And he was able to say,

19:10.772 --> 19:16.782
okay, I'll make you a loan if you can get a release on 
the land, 20% release on the land, 15% payment. So I

19:17.318 --> 19:20.001
got the Grover and Cochran heirs to give me a 
release. Joe, you've probably never heard this

19:20.081 --> 19:21.242
story. I've never heard of it. Release of the land 
for paying 15%. And the bank gave me the money

19:26.767 --> 19:28.408
because I didn't have the money. So then I took the 
residual of the 50,000 acres and went to Great

19:29.049 --> 19:42.362
Southern about six months later and made a full $6 
million 20-year loan, just paid interest for 20

19:29.049 --> 19:42.362
years so I could pay it off on timber. Well, that was 
a land deal. It had nothing to do with the

19:43.363 --> 19:44.464
woodlands. Now, who was Doolin with? the guy who 
originally me and me and me myself and this max

19:46.225 --> 20:15.203
newland who i then hired him to be my forester you 
see and you ought to put his name down he can tell you

19:46.225 --> 20:15.203
all right then then right

19:46.225 --> 20:15.203
after that i found out about the foster lumber 
company which is what kingwood is so i made a run at

19:46.225 --> 20:15.203
that 50 000 more acres even though we're drilling 
oil and gas wells over here for difficult times,

20:15.588 --> 20:17.811
and I had to use leverage, you see. So I made a run at 
them, and I was able to get 21% locked up for a dollar

20:18.532 --> 20:25.941
a share. There were a bunch of heirs, and they were 
in Kansas City, Missouri. I was after the company,

20:31.829 --> 20:35.153
another 50,000 acres for myself. And I had a deal 
made with the 21% at 125 an acre, 150 an acre on that

20:35.934 --> 20:41.341
one. And then I got Boise Cascade, to come in for 
half interest if they would put up the $750,000 I

20:45.220 --> 20:53.710
needed to buy up to 51% and then dissolve the 
company. But they wouldn't put it up unless I had an

20:53.730 --> 20:56.394
option on the 51%. And the guys at 51% wouldn't do it 
unless I had the money. So I couldn't quite do that.

21:04.884 --> 21:12.173
And so what happened while I was negotiating with 
it, Exxon and King Ranch moved in and paid them $300

21:04.884 --> 21:12.173
an acre. That's where Kingwood is. But it was a bad 
piece of land. I was going to red flag it, you know,

21:15.800 --> 21:19.544
just sell it off for 10 acres, 20 francs. So that 
went away. But we made, the company made, because

21:21.987 --> 21:30.077
then I had 125 an acre and 115 an acre, and I sold it 
for two or three to Exxon. So we made a million

21:30.097 --> 21:31.319
dollars. I was really the first green male around 
here. Now, when was the Foster, when we do... That

21:36.723 --> 21:42.611
was about 62, 63, right after both the group and 
Cochran. Yeah, okay. Now, there's no concept of

21:42.872 --> 21:44.714
the Woodlands or anything. We've been piddling 
with a little, a couple of these little

21:45.075 --> 21:51.464
subdivisions around with Norman Dobbins called 
Pace Center Home, but nothing of any magnitude.

21:51.484 --> 21:52.685
Let me pause just one second now. Meanwhile, while 
you're doing all of this, there is a lot of activity

21:52.765 --> 21:57.933
going on down south around NASA and so forth. Are 
you paying any attention to that or thinking about

21:57.953 --> 22:00.136
it? Only that what happened at Exxon made a deal to 
let them have that acreage down there, Frenswood

22:05.782 --> 22:13.591
did, to the 5,000, whatever it is, through Lyndon 
Johnson, to do the space thing. I didn't think that

22:14.372 --> 22:20.519
had too much relation, except it meant that 
Houston had another anchor besides just oil and

22:14.372 --> 22:20.519
gas. But that was very embryonic at that time. Even 
when the Woodlands first started, it was just

22:22.721 --> 22:25.204
beginning. But they were able to start Clear Lake. 
They'd already started Clear Lake before then.

22:28.988 --> 22:30.310
Frenswood had it. But then when NASA came in, it 
really made Clear Lake a lot better. They bought

22:34.434 --> 22:35.215
Clear Lake. They didn't want the Clear Lake. They 
bought it because of the oil field Exxon did, and

22:36.733 --> 22:42.619
the West made them take the damn land at $100 an 
acre. They didn't want the land, the 20,000 acres.

22:45.381 --> 22:48.504
Well, they took it, and then they finally decided 
to do Clear Lake because it was near the bay. And

22:49.305 --> 23:02.018
then after a while, when they found out that there 
was going to be a NASA, they worked on President

22:49.305 --> 23:02.018
Johnson to get them to take whatever acres that 
NASA got out of it as part of the deal to make Clear

22:49.305 --> 23:02.018
Lake go, you see. And all the universities worked 
with them. But we knew about it, and we knew it would

23:03.528 --> 23:09.074
help Houston, but we thought it would have nothing 
to do with it. So then we missed the Foster Lumber

23:10.156 --> 23:16.002
Company deal. But we had the $50,000, I guess. So I 
then started. I had Carl Kamrath start in 66. What

23:25.353 --> 23:30.900
happened in the early 60s, 64, 65, we began to have 
these terrible riots. The Vietnam War was on.

23:33.515 --> 23:36.339
Bedford-Stuyvesant was having a riot up in New 
York City. Watts was having a riot. And I went to

23:37.982 --> 23:42.749
several of these YPO meetings to understand the 
plight of our cities. They're all in desperate

23:42.989 --> 23:44.111
shape. And what was happening in my reckoning, 
that what was destroying our cities was the

23:44.912 --> 23:57.851
proliferation of political subdivisions around 
the central core, and they can't manage it. And

23:57.871 --> 24:00.855
that there ought to be a better way to evolve an 
area. But why did you get in? That's sort of

24:02.774 --> 24:04.096
unusual. Here you are. Because the organization I 
belong to called Young Presidents Organization.

24:09.102 --> 24:09.423
Called what? Young Presidents Organization. 
Whenever we went anywhere, we didn't talk about

24:11.726 --> 24:15.371
business all the time. We talked about philosophy 
and humanities. And we exposed ourselves to the

24:18.515 --> 24:23.682
thoughts of really what makes a nation work. And 
these are local CEOs? Well, it's a national

24:25.424 --> 24:27.066
organization. It's a national organization. We 
have about 30 members here. And then, you see, at

24:29.219 --> 24:34.266
that time, our company was over worth more than a 
couple million dollars. So if you had over 50

24:34.286 --> 24:40.294
people or 100 people, you could qualify to be a 
young president before you're 40. You had to have a

24:40.314 --> 24:43.177
presidency before you're 40 years old or you don't 
qualify. So there were a lot of entrepreneurs.

24:46.402 --> 24:53.611
There were a lot of them that just inherited money, 
and they're usually duds, mad because they don't

24:46.402 --> 24:53.611
know what they did themselves or what their father 
did for them. So this was a hell of an organization.

24:56.915 --> 24:57.336
It really was. So therefore, I was exposed to 
really wanting what was destroying our cities.

25:03.572 --> 25:05.755
And then I got to thinking, well, why can't we do it 
better? And what other place would be better to do

25:06.977 --> 25:10.081
it than Houston? Because Houston was going to go to 
5 million people. I knew that. I knew they were the

25:13.547 --> 25:17.873
beauty, because I lived in Memorial by that time. I 
finished my house. I lived in Memorial from 58 on.

25:21.044 --> 25:24.149
When you came from service into Houston, you moved 
into Houston. You didn't stay in the office. Oh,

25:25.070 --> 25:26.472
no, I moved into Houston. I had an apartment my aunt 
had because there were no apartments available,

25:26.532 --> 25:30.238
and I ran that apartment house. Cynthia and I will 
never do it again. We had to scrape these plaster

25:32.160 --> 25:35.225
walls and paint the damn thing. I said, never again 
will I do that. She agreed with me, but then it was

25:37.328 --> 25:40.993
tough, and we had two kids and one other wife. So it 
was tough. It was tough for her. But then I was able

25:42.936 --> 25:45.800
to have a place to live here because my aunt was 
here. And then the... We first moved in with her

25:48.245 --> 25:56.513
mother, then I got the apartment, because I 
managed the apartment on Elgin, on Fannin and

25:48.245 --> 25:56.513
Elgin, that my aunt owned. So I was able to manage 
the apartment, because there was no housing

25:57.193 --> 26:01.437
available for a while. The first move was sent to 
his mother for about a month and a half, until I got

26:01.457 --> 26:07.243
the apartment, then we moved there, and then we had 
to redo it ourselves. But later on, I bought a

26:07.263 --> 26:13.288
house, so I started getting some royalties, so I 
ended up building a house. I had Ford, Powell &

26:14.409 --> 26:17.172
Carson design it from San Antonio, on North 
McGregor. Beautiful area. Ford, who did it? Ford?

26:23.550 --> 26:26.073
Ford Powell and Carson out of San Antonio. Neil 
Ford designed my house. Because I knew one of the

26:27.935 --> 26:32.040
architects that I was in the Army with, and he 
worked for Neil Ford at that time. Who was that? He

26:32.561 --> 26:33.562
was named Jerry Rogers. Okay. So Neil Ford 
designed my first house. It was only a six-down,

26:37.607 --> 26:39.149
beautiful house. Right on Timbercrest on North 
McGregor in a beautiful wooded area. But what

26:43.674 --> 26:47.158
happened, when the Supreme Court ruling came in, I 
knew it was going to go all black. So then I moved to

26:48.033 --> 26:52.520
Memorial into the Spring Branch School District, 
because I just wanted to go ahead. I guess we had

26:53.581 --> 26:57.927
seven, eight kids at that time, and we just wanted 
to be sure we got a good decent education here. So

26:58.668 --> 27:00.151
that's why I moved out to Memorial area. And then we 
built a house in 65, which we finished in 65, a big

27:00.271 --> 27:05.458
house up there. So anyway, by that time, I had gone 
around the country. It seemed I was destroying the

27:09.124 --> 27:11.147
nation, in my opinion. And how do you do it better? 
So this is what we got thinking. I asked Carl

27:17.058 --> 27:21.783
Cameron, I said, all right, Carl, and you pick, but 
you'll see their names in the book. How many acres

27:23.485 --> 27:27.129
would I need to build a town of 100,000? So they made 
that sketch. And that sketch is fairly accurate of

27:29.411 --> 27:31.974
what we did. So we moved before Pierre and Carl came 
out and they said, you need 20,000 acres. We only

27:38.721 --> 27:41.164
had 4,000 in that spot there. But see, I didn't 
think that was the right spot. looked at the 1960

27:44.564 --> 27:48.169
I-45 area, right where the corner was. 1960 I-45. I 
actually optioned 2,500 acres at $2,500, which I

27:50.912 --> 27:55.859
still have it now. But then I couldn't get the 
10,000 to 15,000 acres I need on the option, so I

27:56.900 --> 28:01.085
gave up on that sign. That was about in 67, 65, right 
after Carl finished his math. Then I said, well,

28:08.255 --> 28:11.499
the best place is, and we looked at where the 
airport was going to be. We knew where the freeway

28:11.519 --> 28:13.221
in the airport was going to be. I-45, and we knew 
where the airport was going to be. We looked at the

28:16.454 --> 28:20.260
sonic problem, because if you get too close to the 
airport, you destroy the chance. We looked at the

28:20.700 --> 28:21.982
freeway. We looked at the beauty of the woods. I had 
lived in Memorial. I knew the Memorial. In fact,

28:26.809 --> 28:38.284
one thing we found out by having this little pace at 
a home thing, that if we had a lot on the west side of

28:26.809 --> 28:38.284
town, and you had one with three trees and one with 
no trees, the one with three trees would get you

28:26.809 --> 28:38.284
$500 more. So we knew the value of the forest, the 
beauty. That's why Memorial is so popular. In

28:44.740 --> 28:50.906
1960, it was a hot thing at that time, but it's been 
screwed up by a bunch of small tracks. It's a big

28:51.567 --> 28:53.489
mess. It's like West Ham all over again. So we 
didn't want to do that. If you don't really design

28:58.514 --> 29:02.978
it properly, I didn't want to do it. So then we 
turned around and said, okay. Carl Cameron did his

29:05.060 --> 29:06.221
study. Then I started with Carl Charlie Lively to 
start building the block. It took 300

29:10.946 --> 29:12.908
transactions. to build a block. And you're trying 
to, you're going for 20,000 acres, or you're...

29:15.520 --> 29:21.127
Charles Lavery, I guess, you got all the data from 
him in the first quarter. Yeah. So then I had to

29:22.469 --> 29:24.913
build a block for 20,000 acres. And it was very 
difficult going with the Catholic Church and with

29:26.154 --> 29:36.989
the Celan Smith Foundation and with this fellow 
McCann at Waco Bank in Woodsville. Gee, what a

29:37.130 --> 29:38.832
terrible negotiation. Well, anyway, starting 
about in 1969, We heard about the University of

29:43.128 --> 29:45.892
Houston. We were building the block. We wanted to 
build a north campus and a south campus. So we went

29:49.938 --> 29:52.721
there, and they took them out before we'd ever done 
anything. And they agreed that they would like to

29:52.741 --> 29:56.346
have a site in the woodlands for the north campus. 
That was 68, 69. We've got some history about that

29:58.289 --> 30:01.253
in there. And then we retained. What I did then is I 
went out to Columbia. First, I had sent people,

30:06.521 --> 30:11.768
well, I went to Columbia first and decided to see 
what Rouse was doing. I looked at all the West Coast

30:16.737 --> 30:22.282
towns, Irvine, Westlake, Rancho Bernardo. But 
how did you get into that? I still don't

30:23.383 --> 30:24.183
understand. How you got into that new town, 
community planning concept? I knew that it was

30:28.247 --> 30:30.249
important for the nation. You see, Texas had 
unusual rule, extraterritorial jurisdiction.

30:35.833 --> 30:38.956
And I knew that if we're going to urbanize to five 
million people, you better do it right. You're

30:38.976 --> 30:41.198
going to destroy the area just like all these other 
cities. They're all in trouble. Detroit,

30:42.112 --> 30:44.695
Cleveland, you talk to them. They've got a central 
core and a hundred subdivisions that can't get

30:44.715 --> 30:49.921
along with each other. And they're destroyed. 
They can't manage. Unless you respond to the

30:52.483 --> 30:55.507
whole, you can't make it work. And that was the 
concept I had. That's what I sold HUD on. Had you

30:58.190 --> 31:03.155
done a lot of reading on this or meeting with people 
other than through the young residents? Well,

31:03.175 --> 31:05.017
naturally, no studying. When you see what caused 
it, you perceive what was wrong. I perceived what

31:09.723 --> 31:10.864
was wrong. with all the urbanization problems. 
And therefore, I felt that this could be a

31:13.740 --> 31:20.952
prototype, and it had flair as itself, of really 
what should be done. The woodlands are really

31:21.673 --> 31:24.598
unique in the country. There's nothing like it. 
And the people will realize it in about 10, 15

31:25.961 --> 31:28.004
years. All right, so then I went to Columbia, 
talked to Jim Rouse. I looked at Levittown, which

31:34.075 --> 31:36.058
is a mess. I looked at the, in fact, I went to the one 
at the Chicago. Well, it hadn't started yet. What?

31:42.614 --> 31:43.195
Park Forest. Yeah, Park Forest. It had started the 
old section, but it hadn't started the new HUD

31:44.096 --> 31:46.799
section. But I went all through. Westlake was the 
upper class. I went through

31:50.283 --> 31:56.029
Scotland and England and France. And all the new 
towns there are worker towns. All the ones on the

31:59.393 --> 32:02.397
west coast are upper class towns. Columbia, 
Maryland was the best I'd seen. The rest of

32:04.239 --> 32:07.142
Virginia was upper class. I'd looked at it, I'd 
seen all of them. So I thought what I did then, so I

32:09.804 --> 32:14.390
started hiring some of Rouse's people. Dick 
Brown, Mike Richman,

32:14.410 --> 32:19.977
Olen Ivins. I hired about 10 of them. So Rouse sent a 
man down threatening to sue me if I didn't quit

32:20.958 --> 32:26.265
hiring. Petito. So I said, okay, Jim, I won't hire 
anymore. And then we started building a team

32:29.789 --> 32:36.117
together because no one in this country had done 
anything of this magnitude of this like that we've

32:29.789 --> 32:36.117
talked of. We'd seen what they were doing. We'd 
watched the Kingwood thing was getting started by

32:38.559 --> 32:41.483
that time. We lost out on that. But no one did the 
amount of planning we did. We had social structure

32:46.329 --> 32:49.774
studies done by social artists. And that's one of 
the unusual things about all of this. Texas

32:51.997 --> 32:53.078
developers never did that. We had all the bishops 
together with me to plan the concept. Then we hired

32:56.643 --> 33:02.290
Ian McHarrig because he was the most important 
environmental planner in the world at that time,

32:56.643 --> 33:02.290
in my opinion. And where did you get into McHart, 
for example? Well, for an instant, Bob

33:05.943 --> 33:12.831
Hartsfield, who I had as my planning director at 
that time. And then where did Hartsfield come

33:13.251 --> 33:14.573
from? McHart was his instructor at the University 
of Pennsylvania. He said, before you decide who

33:19.959 --> 33:24.524
you're going to do your work, I want you to do one 
thing. I want you to read the book Design with

33:25.706 --> 33:28.209
Nature. Yeah, I remember seeing that reference, 
yeah. I did. So then I said, all right, MacArthur,

33:32.105 --> 33:35.328
would you come with us to do this project? And he 
said, well, he jumped at the chance, you see. And

33:38.971 --> 33:40.513
then I said, well, who want to do the master plan? He 
said he would do the environmental studies. And

33:42.695 --> 33:44.937
then the master plan, and I looked at all of them. I 
looked at two or three on the West Coast. Nobody in

33:46.639 --> 33:51.203
this part of the country had enough experience to 
do it, the type of master plan I wanted done. So I

33:51.223 --> 33:54.306
looked all over the country, and I found out that 
Pereira had done more. He had done more. He did

33:55.066 --> 33:55.807
Irvine. He did one in Iran at that time. He was doing 
that. I even talked to Doxiades, the Greek.

34:01.298 --> 34:02.199
planner at that time. But I couldn't feel I could 
come over here and be connected with him. But he had

34:05.824 --> 34:08.587
done some great work in all of Europe, you see. So 
then. But you'd given this an awful lot of, that's

34:10.470 --> 34:16.317
what amazes me about the whole, that you've cast 
your net worldwide already. Because if you want to

34:17.038 --> 34:28.573
make it something so different and so important, 
you had to really get the best talent or the best

34:17.038 --> 34:28.573
thought you could get anywhere and try to 
amalgamate into what we're talking about trying

34:17.038 --> 34:28.573
to put together. So then we had, oh man, we had 
meetings with the environmentalists. In other

34:32.304 --> 34:37.710
words, McCarrick came in before Prairie River 
started, and he brought ten scientists along with

34:32.304 --> 34:37.710
him. He usually retained them here. He had A&M. We 
did infrared, you know, photography on it. And we

34:42.295 --> 34:43.457
knew all the trees. We knew where to put the lines. 
We knew where to put the golf course and things like

34:44.378 --> 34:46.160
that. McCarrick with Rice did our drainage, which 
had been remarkably good. I'll tell you, Joe,

34:49.564 --> 34:55.190
earlier that we've had three big storms since when 
we had ten-inch rains. Yeah, almost had one this

34:55.390 --> 34:57.833
morning coming through. So we have done, and we did 
what to protect the wildlife, et cetera, et

34:58.387 --> 35:02.512
cetera. And we did that before you ever heard. We 
wrote the first environmental impact statement

35:03.733 --> 35:06.396
ever done by HUD. And they use it as a model for other 
projects like that. So this is what we did because

35:10.040 --> 35:18.891
McHarg spent one year on concern about the 
environment before we did any master planning

35:10.040 --> 35:18.891
that Prairie did. And then we put the plan together 
with McHarg. And surprisingly, it worked out well

35:21.534 --> 35:25.258
with Prairie and McHarg. We haven't changed too 
much conflict and how you preserve the trees, and

35:28.660 --> 35:31.604
how you preserve the wildlife, et cetera. All 
those things were thought of early on. And this is

35:34.328 --> 35:37.733
what no one had done before that time, and 
therefore. But then how do you urbanize, which is

35:38.134 --> 35:42.440
what's important that we got Houston to do? When we 
finally put all the block together, the full

35:44.583 --> 35:50.872
25,000, we've got some here maybe just five or six 
years ago, the last pieces. And we've got some now

35:51.213 --> 35:54.437
on the south side of the creek. We're trying to 
build a big lake. That'll be the next 10 years. How

35:59.525 --> 36:04.631
do you put this block together, but then how do you 
really be part of the whole? So Houston and Texas

36:04.671 --> 36:09.717
have a unique block called Exeterritory 
Jurisdiction. If the five-mile boundary from the

36:11.299 --> 36:28.941
city limits touched your land here, and it barely 
touched our southern boundary, then you can ask

36:11.299 --> 36:28.941
the city of Houston to take the whole 25,000 acres 
into their Exeterritory Jurisdiction, which

36:11.299 --> 36:28.941
means that no one can incorporate unless Houston 
approves it. Now, what that means is that as you

36:29.309 --> 36:36.760
urbanize, if we and I live there and Joe lives 
there, we don't make Houston work. We shouldn't be

36:38.202 --> 36:42.268
parasailing at the airport and the port and NASA 
and all that other stuff. We, those of us, because

36:42.288 --> 36:52.262
what was destroying all our towns in the country 
that I saw, the flight to the suburb of the town and

36:42.288 --> 36:52.262
the tax base was killing all the towns. And they'd 
get out in their little political subterfuge, and

36:53.153 --> 36:59.040
they could care less about New York City, et 
cetera. Or around Washington. They could care

37:01.263 --> 37:10.474
less about Washington, D.C. And that lack of 
carelessness and not being concerned is what's

37:01.263 --> 37:10.474
destroying all our cities. If your talent, and 
unfortunately the talent is mostly in the Anglo

37:11.255 --> 37:21.507
world at this time, until things happen as time 
goes on, that talent flees to the suburbs. It's

37:22.583 --> 37:23.705
going to destroy all your cities. The Woodlands 
can't do that. Those that have talent in the

37:27.089 --> 37:32.136
Woodlands, if I have any talent or Joe has any 
talent, may kind of make Houston work. Because

37:32.817 --> 37:35.080
Houston should never let that go. So this was part 
of your initial plan, is that what you did there is

37:35.360 --> 37:39.285
going to be part of the city. Now, let me say this. 
The people in the Woodlands don't like that. No,

37:42.830 --> 37:44.753
because that's not typical. They keep coming up a 
little bit. And the threat is, if you do this,

37:48.858 --> 37:52.303
Houston will make you prematurely, and you'll 
really get cut to pieces but you know that's the

37:52.537 --> 38:17.818
thing that that they would like to have what really 
what people want they don't want to live downtown

37:52.537 --> 38:17.818
in 610 loop some people will maybe four or five 
percent they want to want really particularly if

37:52.537 --> 38:17.818
you have any family the quality of urban life to be 
part of the whole that's what people want to be and

37:52.537 --> 38:17.818
that's the concept i have what they really want to 
be is part of the whole but have the quality of

38:18.608 --> 38:21.512
lifestyle that you may be left with. And then we 
build a job base. We worked on studies about the

38:23.495 --> 38:27.621
commercial side and the high-tech side. And we're 
going to someday make it going to be similar to

38:28.282 --> 38:33.189
Research Forest and part of the area there. I mean, 
Research Triangle. So that's a concept that's all

38:36.754 --> 38:39.117
coming together. That is very complex and very 
difficult to execute. You can see the trouble I had

38:43.183 --> 38:46.287
in the first 15 years is terrible. At what point did 
your concept of having an economically

38:46.992 --> 38:55.602
integrated community begin to develop? In other 
words, having the jobs there for the families

38:55.622 --> 38:58.306
to... Let me say this. The first exercise we did, we 
did a three-legged stool. Joe, you have that

39:03.552 --> 39:04.653
slide. We put on there that what urbanization 
should be is where you really have the

39:06.776 --> 39:14.485
environment, Man-to-man relationship in 
economics. And if they don't all work together,

39:19.641 --> 39:23.805
they won't work. If you take one leg off, it won't 
work. Now, this is a concept we started at the very

39:26.447 --> 39:28.329
beginning. And when we used to give a slide, we'd 
say, Joe, I'd use that as the concept that we put

39:29.410 --> 39:34.475
together. So you've really got now, knowing this, 
these projects are very difficult. In fact, you

39:37.257 --> 39:39.439
don't start turning them around for 10 years. And 
major companies don't want to tackle them because

39:40.420 --> 39:43.763
they're earning the next quarter. You've got to 
have a long-range and mid-range thought to make it

39:44.789 --> 39:47.913
work. Hopefully, we had energy to help us over the 
rough spots, and it still helps us over the rough

39:48.613 --> 39:52.117
spots. If you didn't have energy, you could never 
do these projects. Because HUD's projects, you

39:55.161 --> 40:01.128
see, I found out about HUD's program about in 70, I 
think it was. Found out that it had the new

40:02.830 --> 40:04.492
Community Act. We had looked at the Title VII deal, 
which was not as good. Then we went to the Title X.

40:10.523 --> 40:12.124
which gave up to $50 million. We convinced HUD that 
this is the best project they've ever seen. And

40:14.727 --> 40:15.127
they won. They did. It's the largest grant. A 
guarantee. It wasn't a grant. A guarantee. They

40:18.170 --> 40:19.511
have no damn grant. They did give us some grants for 
subsidized roads and subsidized housing. But the

40:25.016 --> 40:27.418
$50 million was a guaranteed loan. We had to pay it 
back. We still pay it back. We had a schedule. But we

40:29.761 --> 40:31.082
don't know if we'll ever survive. So I kid HUD all 
the time. I said, don't feel so bad. We're going to

40:34.865 --> 40:35.546
survive. You've got two others that might survive 
with you helping the bank run. That's 3 out of 13.

40:39.730 --> 40:40.210
Hell, every... I had it every 10 o'clock. I'd only 
hit one. You're doing pretty good. You got three

40:43.076 --> 40:45.658
out of 13, but they don't, they go tell the 
Congress. They don't have any guts. Well, what was

40:47.921 --> 40:49.863
the problem, the HUD problem? I mean, why 
didn't... See, if the HUD had a 13 project, I would

40:50.003 --> 40:55.909
say nine were ill-conceived. Yeah. Politics. 
Yeah. Or under the airport like the flower man was

40:58.031 --> 41:00.554
under the Dallas airport. Yeah. I mean, they just, 
the concept, see, we studied the woods. We knew the

41:04.838 --> 41:06.140
woods would bring people. Yeah. They loved to live 
in the woods. Yeah, sure. We knew that I-45 was

41:08.776 --> 41:11.018
being built. It wouldn't start. It wouldn't 
finish it right by the Woodlands. We had to have

41:13.721 --> 41:16.044
that to access to Houston. We studied the whole 
airport. It wouldn't finish yet. We knew what the

41:18.166 --> 41:21.369
sonic situation was going to be around the 
intercontinental airport. They hadn't finished

41:21.389 --> 41:22.190
the airport. They just started working on it by 
that time. So we studied all those things to make it

41:24.332 --> 41:26.875
work. Because any one of those could have been a 
serious flaw to destroy the project. And so we

41:32.341 --> 41:35.644
tried to figure out what the flaws may have been. 
And yet, you know, it's still a long way. We're not

41:37.959 --> 41:38.580
sure. We think it'll be . What about the research 
component of this? Where'd that come from? Well,

41:43.465 --> 41:50.173
what we did early on is that the University of 
Houston here is 400 acres for your north campus.

41:51.855 --> 41:57.781
And then we got to thinking, since they were very 
slow and the legislature would not approve it, A&M

41:51.855 --> 41:57.781
fought them all the time. Too near A&M. See what I 
mean? Yeah, more. Kill us. Dennis and I, why don't

42:05.071 --> 42:07.373
we get the four universities together? And then 
that's when I went ahead off a little, make a study.

42:11.337 --> 42:12.097
Is it feasible? And we looked at, I looked at the 
case history. If you ever looked at the case

42:14.820 --> 42:20.525
history of Stanford Research or Research 
Triangle, it's like the perils of Pauline. And I

42:21.066 --> 42:23.608
looked at all, I just read all the case histories of 
those projects. And I felt that they came back off a

42:24.929 --> 42:31.355
little study, which we paid $300,000, said it's 
feasible if you get those four universities to

42:24.929 --> 42:31.355
agree. So I went to A&M and Rice and U of H Board of 
Regents, and they agreed, OK, we will try to do this

42:35.429 --> 42:42.397
project that we could do together better than we 
can envision. So after I got them on, I asked A&M, is

42:43.057 --> 42:46.982
it all right if I go get UT Austin? All right, go 
ahead. So who are you talking to, incidentally, at

42:48.123 --> 42:50.906
A&M? Oh, I've forgotten who was present that time. 
William? No, it was before my first time. Jack

42:57.373 --> 42:58.094
Williams? I got approval back in 80, I think it was, 
or 79, 80. I had to go to the board. I went up there and

43:04.842 --> 43:07.747
saw, I guess it was Miller or whoever it was I saw. I 
have to go back to the record. Probably Miller.

43:09.790 --> 43:13.316
Whoever it was, I went two or three trips up there 
and said, all right, let's bring him for the board.

43:14.058 --> 43:15.260
U of H was going to conduct a hawk. But you got a 
pretty good reception. Oh, yeah, I got a good

43:16.802 --> 43:18.024
reception. You should have. And they knew I was a 
strong Aggie and I would protect Aggie's

43:19.366 --> 43:22.512
interests. And then when I got UT, they agreed to 
let UT come in. Really, the super conductor, Super

43:26.058 --> 43:28.622
Cloud, you wouldn't have it if we hadn't had the 
work. I had those four universities together,

43:28.822 --> 43:31.965
working with Peter McIntyre and myself. And 
Peter, of course, is the godfather. And then I

43:33.867 --> 43:37.731
helped put the first money together for them to 
make it work. Otherwise, Texas would never have

43:37.751 --> 43:40.654
had that $8 billion project. So those are things 
that in the next 20, 10 years, if you're going to

43:40.674 --> 43:45.479
write about it, it's very important. And then 
also, we're going to be working on it. But why,

43:47.261 --> 43:48.562
again, research? Was research supposed to give 
you a certain style of life or quality of life or an

43:48.622 --> 43:55.269
economic base? Where did you get that from? Let me 
give you an opinion. I studied the research

43:58.488 --> 44:00.830
triangle in North Carolina and went over there. 
Yeah, which is really beautiful. And I studied the

44:02.973 --> 44:05.755
history, how difficult it was to get it started. 
Governor Hodge had a terrible time getting it

44:06.036 --> 44:09.139
started. But those three universities helped 
make it work, and then the people made it work. The

44:12.642 --> 44:14.064
whole state worked at it. Here you've got a state 
that's divided between the Panhandle area, the

44:14.084 --> 44:19.249
San Antonio area, and the Houston area. You can't 
get everybody to go together. The Dallas-Fort

44:21.532 --> 44:24.435
Worth area, of course, is part of the North Texas 
area. That's about the hardest area. So

44:27.614 --> 44:30.118
therefore, we have to say you go regional basis. 
But then I think that what we think can be done here

44:30.839 --> 44:38.590
is that if I get these four universities to 
cooperate, and that's not very hard, even A&M. You

44:40.453 --> 44:45.701
give it 10 or 20 or 30 years, it could be as important 
for this region as Texas Medical Center. And

44:45.721 --> 44:47.904
people don't believe that. It's another level 
higher than each university. If you can get the

44:51.910 --> 44:57.418
private sector engaged with the universities, 
which they can't do very well. They can't do that

44:58.107 --> 44:59.488
very well. And we can. We've already done about 
nine venture capital companies. It's already

45:03.792 --> 45:05.894
there. MDNs with A&M, with Baylor, with 
University of Technical Science. We helped put

45:11.139 --> 45:13.782
together the research for us, as we call it. We used 
the Advanced Research Center, the full

45:14.803 --> 45:18.626
university, the collaborative. We've got LSU 
now. We're trying to get others to be

45:19.027 --> 45:21.589
collaborating. Those are things that you build a 
critical. We've got about 1,000 scientists now.

45:24.452 --> 45:27.034
When we get 5,000 scientists, it'll really,
