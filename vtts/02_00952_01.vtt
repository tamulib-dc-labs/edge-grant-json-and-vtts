00:04.773 --> 00:09.557
The following is an interview with Leon Wilhite, 
assistant director of planning for the state of

00:04.773 --> 00:09.557
Texas. The interview was conducted by Robert 
Cornish and Kent McLemore on the 2nd of April, 1984

00:09.978 --> 00:20.648
in Austin in the Sam Houston office building in 
Leon Wilhite's office.

00:23.430 --> 00:27.114
When did you begin your tenure with the state? I 
started back in the fall of 1971 under Preston

00:27.134 --> 00:34.020
Smith's administration. that in those days, we 
had a division of planning coordination. And that

00:41.233 --> 00:44.716
division was really into policy planning. Under

00:46.537 --> 00:58.328
really some national initiatives under HUD 7701, 
they began encouraging planning

00:46.537 --> 00:58.328
responsibilities at the state level. And we began 
seeing a number of states create offices Back in

01:04.696 --> 01:11.226
1969 was one of the first years that there was a 
division planning coordination. And Jim Ray was

01:11.306 --> 01:15.051
not the first director of the division. That was 
under Conley. But there was a director for about

01:18.517 --> 01:24.906
two or three months before Jim Ray took over. And 
Jim was one of the first directors, I think one of

01:25.507 --> 01:30.855
the first identified directors, Shortly after 
Jim Ray left and Preston Smith came on, Dan Petty

01:31.358 --> 01:42.292
was the director in 69 under Preston Smith. And Dan 
Petty had worked for Bill Pitstick in North

01:42.412 --> 01:57.371
Central Texas Council of Governments and was very 
instrumental in getting some of the early stages

01:42.412 --> 01:57.371
of North Central planning activity started. But 
under Dan Petty, the division planning

02:00.215 --> 02:02.699
coordination really took hold. And under Preston 
Smith, we began seeing some policy planning and

02:02.839 --> 02:11.293
some coordination work done. And in fact, I think 
during the 69-71 era, just before I was involved,

02:12.175 --> 02:26.779
this office was recognized on a national basis as a 
planning and coordination office, and that model

02:27.181 --> 02:31.425
as a fairly strong planning core coordination 
type agency. We got a national award at the

02:32.226 --> 02:36.289
national level, I think, in 1970. Part of all of 
that recognition came from the old Goals for Texas

02:37.170 --> 02:49.001
program that started back in the latter part of 69, 
carried it through, and was finally, I guess,

02:37.170 --> 02:49.001
completed. It was phase one and phase two, and 
those were finally completed in the latter part of

02:49.281 --> 02:56.428
1970.

02:57.033 --> 03:06.849
The Goals for Texas, I think, was a real good 
initiative, one of the first identified

02:57.033 --> 03:06.849
statewide planning activities. And the first 
phase of it was to identify at the state level what

03:07.770 --> 03:16.804
were the key areas. It broke down the whole 
planning spectrum down into about 10 categories.

03:25.113 --> 03:33.801
Then after phase one was drawn together, what 
state agencies thought the issues and the

03:25.113 --> 03:33.801
problems were and the goals were, they went out for 
phase two. And it was a thicker, more

03:33.862 --> 03:36.945
comprehensive effort. And I remember, Bob, in I'm 
not sure what year of our planning program, when I

03:36.965 --> 03:51.479
was a student over at Bryan College Station, we 
participated in one of the committees there in

03:36.965 --> 03:51.479
Bryan. And I remember. several people coming from 
the state. And they were trying to get little

03:56.923 --> 04:00.528
committees working. And I remember sitting on the 
natural resource committee when the goals were

04:00.588 --> 04:07.758
being established. And I really think the key 
thing about the goals for Texas was it began really

04:07.938 --> 04:25.022
talking in terms of goals and objectives and 
trying to identify what they were and trying to

04:07.938 --> 04:25.022
begin in the beginning of each one of those 
documents began specifying five-year,

04:25.508 --> 04:32.517
seven-year objectives and so on. I think it did a 
great deal for beginning a planning dialogue. It

04:40.527 --> 04:52.782
was very unfortunate that, of course, after any 
governor creates something like a planning

04:40.527 --> 04:52.782
initiative or any kind of policy initiative and 
then goes out of office, that initiative tends to

04:53.335 --> 04:57.420
die down. There was a Phase I of Goals for Texas II, 
and then there was a follow-on, so-called Phase

04:57.440 --> 05:07.232
III, which was really the budget document. It was 
the first year in state government that we went to a

05:07.252 --> 05:20.929
program-type budget, and we tried to tie the goals 
and objectives identified in the Phase I and II

05:07.252 --> 05:20.929
into the budget document itself. This was the 
early days of back in 73 was the first year the state

05:21.584 --> 05:40.049
created a zero-based budgeting concept and was 
beginning to move into mandating that state

05:21.584 --> 05:40.049
agencies develop objectives. And prior to really 
71, The budget process itself strictly

05:45.057 --> 05:56.511
identified personnel, travel, and normal 
budgetary kinds of cost centers. It did not in any

05:57.432 --> 06:02.278
way lay out budgets on a program basis. As I said 
later on, zero-based budgeting came into being

06:03.500 --> 06:14.473
and actually picked up and took it on to we now have 
more of a program type budget. Phase III was an

06:14.808 --> 06:23.060
effort to try to move us from the normal old 
categorical budget to a program budget. The Goals

06:23.420 --> 06:28.908
for Texas program, isn't it true that it was 
modeled more or less after the Goals for Dallas?

06:29.549 --> 06:33.275
That had been quite successful a few years before. 
I think so. I think so. And I would think it

06:35.117 --> 06:42.688
probably, since the Dan Petty came from Dallas and 
Arlington came from North Central Texas Council

06:43.208 --> 06:50.137
of Governments, that the idea might have spawned 
from that experience. Quite frankly, during my

06:50.158 --> 06:59.831
early days of the governor's office, I had not 
heard that much about Goals for Dallas prior to

06:50.158 --> 06:59.831
Goals for Texas. Really, Goals for Dallas had 
another run at it after Goals for Texas, and it

07:00.512 --> 07:09.804
seemed to get even more publicity later. So I did 
not realize that Goals for Dallas came first, but I

07:12.436 --> 07:16.141
understand later that it did. The Goals for Texas 
program resulted in a national APA award for the

07:17.604 --> 07:32.385
chapter, which is the only national award the 
chapter has ever received. From AIP at that time?

07:33.867 --> 07:36.451
From AIP, yeah. It was in my office, if you ever 
needed it. aware of exactly what role AIP did play

07:41.478 --> 07:45.966
at that time. I don't know that John Shanahan 
played a role because John was down here during the

07:46.827 --> 08:04.017
time that was going on, but John was not in the 
Division of Planning and Coordination per se, but

07:46.827 --> 08:04.017
he was in the Office of State-Local Relations, 
which was a division in the Governor's office. But

08:04.157 --> 08:06.321
obviously Did AIP play a role or iChapter play a 
role in setting up Golds for Texas? I think that our

08:11.697 --> 08:16.743
chapter probably just simply provide a nurturing 
role. But if the truth be known, the award probably

08:17.304 --> 08:24.593
should have gone to the governor's office rather 
than chapter. Well, we got awards. I think HUD

08:26.635 --> 08:28.798
wound up, because of Obviously, they helped fund 
some of the earlier work. And they were real proud

08:31.792 --> 08:33.955
of it, I'm sure. And we got an award there. And I'm 
not sure. I think the National Association of

08:36.537 --> 08:43.184
Regional Councils also gave us an award on that. So 
there were several awards. But I think the goal for

08:46.127 --> 08:48.549
Texas was. That might be a good thing to document 
precisely so that we can put that in. Which

08:53.574 --> 08:56.237
different groups' awards? You know, that could 
possibly be documented. I'm not sure I can.

09:01.662 --> 09:02.583
There's several. There's one here. You might stop 
it if you want to. It's part of a golden age. Yeah. I

09:12.419 --> 09:23.997
think one key thing about Goals for Texas was that 
while regional councils were still being

09:12.419 --> 09:23.997
organized, regional planning commissions were 
still being organized in Texas, In fact, the last

09:24.517 --> 09:30.445
one was organized out at Midland-Odessa in 1971. 
So you can tell Goldford, Texas ended in 70, the end

09:30.505 --> 09:36.993
of 70. But most of the regional councils that were 
organized at that time, that was a very early

09:38.355 --> 09:49.269
agenda item that the governor had asked regional 
councils to help informalize it. Bragg's Valley

09:49.809 --> 09:52.633
Development Council, when I was a student, was the 
instrument to help organize and get the local

09:53.018 --> 10:00.989
input and the committees set up and all that. Many 
of the councils of government had just been

10:01.509 --> 10:15.668
transformed from the old EDDs, Economic 
Development Divisions or whatever, into

10:01.509 --> 10:15.668
councils of governments. Economic Development 
Districts were formed back in early years. I'm not

10:20.134 --> 10:22.097
sure when the first one was formed, but In the 
latter 60s and then early 70s, we began trying to,

10:22.398 --> 10:37.532
as a policy of the governor, in fact, Governor 
Smith, we began folding regional, really the

10:22.398 --> 10:37.532
districts into regional councils and trying to 
merge them. There's still two or three that still

10:37.793 --> 10:39.915
exist. Even after we pressed a lot trying to force 
them into one organization, there's still two or

10:40.495 --> 10:49.924
three that currently exist. Brazos Valley 
Development Council was one example of a district

10:50.225 --> 10:59.680
that became the regional council of Brazos Valley 
Development Council. What is the status of the

11:00.501 --> 11:09.114
regional planning areas now that are focused 
around COGS? The state's been divided into

11:09.134 --> 11:11.458
planning regions. Are those still existing? Yes. 
State planning regions still exist. The last time

11:16.094 --> 11:19.700
that we've had a county change was 1973. We've been 
laboring extensively trying to keep those

11:20.682 --> 11:37.933
regions somewhat consistent and sacred, 
although we review the boundaries every two years

11:20.682 --> 11:37.933
under law. We have tried to encourage that they 
stay the same, and we try to use the regions. Each 24

11:44.488 --> 11:49.973
of the 24 regions are multiples thereof in 
planning activities. So we've seen for planning,

11:50.853 --> 12:01.743
and then many agencies are trying to use the 
regions as best they can for operational

11:50.853 --> 12:01.743
purposes, program operations. Most of the human 
service type agencies are finding that They need

12:06.128 --> 12:12.957
anywhere from 10 to 12 regions rather than 24, so 
they make combinations thereof. But we've

12:12.977 --> 12:33.925
continued over 10 or 12 years to push for the 
geographic framework so that, you know, Texas has

12:12.977 --> 12:33.925
254 counties and is extremely diverse and over 
3,000 cities and various and sundry kinds of

12:12.977 --> 12:33.925
cities. And it's almost mandated that we look at 
some multiples of all of those to be able to handle

12:34.310 --> 12:45.482
any kind of activity. So state-planning regions 
are still a vehicle we're using. Conley formed the

12:52.229 --> 12:58.776
regions initially in 1968 after a consultant 
study. They tried to form regions where you had A

13:03.588 --> 13:08.335
metropolitan area, primarily one of the first 
things we looked for was an SMSA. And then we tried

13:08.976 --> 13:18.831
to align counties that were naturally drawn to 
that metropolitan area, both economically,

13:08.976 --> 13:18.831
geographically. And there were about nine 
specific criteria used to determine where a

13:19.291 --> 13:26.582
county would be aligned. And our studies every two 
years have tried to reiterate those criteria to

13:27.323 --> 13:33.392
determine where it would go. We've had counties 
officially request movement. We've had to go out

13:39.662 --> 13:45.509
and meet with the counties and cities and 
citizenry. And to really go through that criteria

13:45.749 --> 13:57.442
with them, we find that usually those things, 
after they're all settled down, everybody feels

13:45.749 --> 13:57.442
like they're aligned about right. So it was all 
based on a 68 study. Conley started it. under

14:03.815 --> 14:12.185
Preston Smith, policy development in regard to 
playing regions became a fairly major issue. We

14:13.006 --> 14:23.540
moved into some fairly heavy-handed positions of 
mandating that counties move here and there and

14:13.006 --> 14:23.540
that state agencies shall use. During the years 
from 71 through Briscoe administration, the

14:24.781 --> 14:33.552
playing regions were intact, but not forcefully 
implemented. State agencies began drifting away

14:37.372 --> 14:42.598
and doing other kinds of things. But planning 
regions stayed intact since that time, since

14:42.738 --> 14:49.867
really 68. And the only major change, the last 
major change, was in 73. So I think we do have the

14:56.815 --> 15:03.943
geographic framework for our planning and state 
agencies Right now, I guess, if you drew a bottom

15:04.598 --> 15:12.986
line, try to use them, although we've got issues 
like river authorities. The water agency, for

15:13.747 --> 15:25.137
example, has a hard time using planning regions 
because river basins do not really recognize

15:13.747 --> 15:25.137
political boundaries. When you're dealing with 
water issues, basically, Bob's an expert in that.

15:31.632 --> 15:37.539
you really do not do well by trying to go off of 
political boundaries for that basis. So we've

15:39.262 --> 15:47.292
struggled a little bit with those kinds of issues, 
how you deal with environmental concerns that

15:39.262 --> 15:47.292
really do not recognize boundaries. But we're 
dealing with a big one right now with Canada, for

15:49.595 --> 15:59.327
example, on acid rain that doesn't recognize an 
international boundary, for example. Well,

16:00.607 --> 16:30.529
okay, on the state planning reasons,

16:00.607 --> 16:30.529
could you give us

16:00.607 --> 16:30.529
the benefit of your experience with the Smith 
administration and the sort of thing that

16:00.607 --> 16:30.529
Governor Smith was attempting to establish for 
the state's role in planning and how that came

16:00.607 --> 16:30.529
about and who the principal players were in all of 
that? I think, as

16:31.150 --> 16:39.904
I mentioned, Gold for Texas was one keynote. I 
think the latter part of the Smith

16:40.184 --> 16:59.014
administration, in fact, just before losing the 
election, and then by January after, in the

16:40.184 --> 16:59.014
process of leaving, there were a number of 
documents published that were really And we look

16:59.264 --> 17:09.139
back on those documents as being now some real 
valuable cornerstones, if you will. There were a

17:09.259 --> 17:25.182
number of planning policies established, 
policies about economic development districts

17:09.259 --> 17:25.182
moving from districts doing their own thing to 
being a part of the regular planning system. Those

17:26.324 --> 17:28.427
documents were policies that if If Smith had been 
around for a while and the players as they were at

17:28.964 --> 17:44.041
that time, we would have seen, we would have for 
sure not seen three economic development

17:28.964 --> 17:44.041
districts floating around out there by 
themselves right now. There were just a lot of

17:45.062 --> 17:50.167
those kinds of things that were being forced at 
that time. Ed Grisham was the director of the

17:50.888 --> 17:54.432
division planning coordination at that time. 
under Preston Smith, and I would think would have

17:54.867 --> 17:59.011
to be identified as a key person. After Dan Petty 
moved over to the governor's executive assistant

17:59.092 --> 18:07.100
position, he handpicked Ed Grisham. And Ed, Bob, I 
mentioned Ed as being the new chairman of the Texas

18:07.280 --> 18:14.608
Employment Commission over now. But Ed was a very, 
in fact, Ed was the point guy for Dan Petty on the

18:15.189 --> 18:22.957
Goals for Texas program. He was the staffer. that 
did a lot of the nuts and bolts work. Where did Ed

18:27.929 --> 18:28.990
come from? Ed was a Texan, and somewhere sort of 
west, central Texas somewhere, I'm not sure, the

18:30.492 --> 18:48.853
little town, but had gone to school out of sort of 
the landscape program, I think, out at Texas Tech.

18:49.643 --> 18:57.312
and had worked for the Department of Agriculture 
within Washington for some time. I'm not sure, a

18:57.352 --> 18:58.433
short time. He was a young guy. When he was a 
director here, he was about 32. And so he was still

19:01.937 --> 19:07.423
young and had a lot of vinegar. And Ed was the 
director. Another key actor in that division was

19:10.967 --> 19:17.575
Walter Tibbetts, as I mentioned to you, is now back 
as a part of the governor's staff. And Walter was

19:18.095 --> 19:34.192
the person that hired me and was involved in hiring 
several people that really carried the office

19:18.095 --> 19:34.192
from about 71 through probably around 74 or 75. 
There were quite a few of our people that carried

19:34.252 --> 19:42.560
quite a bit of initiatives and so on. Up to my 
hiring. There had never been anybody with any kind

19:45.702 --> 19:50.227
of planning degree. Most everybody in this office 
was a public administrator, a government major,

19:50.687 --> 20:06.945
and even Ed Grisham, while having a landscape type 
background, was not out of a planning program. And

20:08.006 --> 20:13.212
in 71, I was hired by a guy named Tony Briard that 
came out the University of Texas Planning School.

20:15.996 --> 20:26.212
We were the two that were hired in 1971, sort of the 
first so-called graduated, educated planner

20:15.996 --> 20:26.212
types. And it was sort of interesting. While they 
were getting these national awards from planning

20:28.054 --> 20:37.228
organizations and all that, they were all saying, 
but we're not planners. I want you to make sure that

20:37.348 --> 20:43.097
you understand that we appreciate the planning 
principles, but we're not planners. And I

20:46.872 --> 20:59.130
remember Dan Petty always referring to planner 
types and planners, but he was always the one that

20:46.872 --> 20:59.130
was really pushing setting up goals, programs, 
and so forth. Most everybody had the concept of a

21:00.151 --> 21:13.050
planner being a street grid system layout person 
that really did very structural planning

21:00.151 --> 21:13.050
activities. They really didn't view planning as a 
process where, really, decisions are made. And I

21:21.062 --> 21:30.472
think that's been my song throughout day one, is 
that planning is just a structured

21:21.062 --> 21:30.472
decision-making process. And that during the 
middle 70s, I'll just say to you that planning was

21:31.253 --> 21:40.303
viewed as land use planning. When you said 
planning, you meant regulating land and its use.

21:45.945 --> 21:53.052
And during that period of time, that was a no-no, 
very much a no-no. And so even people started

21:53.932 --> 21:57.616
dropping the planning name. They were very 
fearful of turning folks off from planning. And I

22:03.001 --> 22:11.168
continually, throughout those periods of time, 
tried to get people to view planning as a process.

22:11.654 --> 22:16.939
And as laying the options out to the governor, we 
can make a good decision. And that's what planning

22:16.959 --> 22:29.332
is all about, and trying to transcend this cloud of 
this nasty process and concern. It seems like you

22:30.333 --> 22:39.703
then were part of the cutting edge of the new 
movement of redefining the planning process and

22:30.333 --> 22:39.703
what planning is about. Because prior to, well, 
the decade of the 70s, planning was largely

22:40.139 --> 22:47.630
focused on land use planning. There's no question 
about that. And it was all pretty physical. And

22:51.395 --> 22:56.703
then with the discovery of the environment and so 
forth, that was reiterated. But then we went on to

22:56.763 --> 23:01.810
other things and redefining it as a management 
tool. And it's interesting that you were here in

23:02.692 --> 23:07.699
Austin carrying that word. at the very time that it 
was being done all around the country, actually.

23:12.272 --> 23:18.339
And so we weren't in any way lagging behind the rest 
of the country at that point. In fact, probably we

23:18.359 --> 23:21.684
were right at the cutting edge of it. I really 
think, and I contribute a lot to the playing school

23:21.704 --> 23:26.870
at A&M. I came out of the architecture program, so 
therefore I was very much oriented toward the

23:27.711 --> 23:36.522
physical view of things. Most of my coursework, 
outside of the structure of the curriculum that I

23:36.923 --> 23:46.596
had to take, was very much oriented in sociology. 
Some of the business courses I took,

23:47.257 --> 23:59.212
quite a few courses, philosophy and things like 
that, took me really away from sort of that

23:47.257 --> 23:59.212
physical thing. And it really had an impact on me. 
some of the people politically were very much more

24:05.273 --> 24:09.758
to the left of where I was. I grew up in East Texas, 
very much conservative in political

24:09.858 --> 24:15.243
perspective. I went to the core, was in 
architecture school. And I remember taking a

24:20.228 --> 24:25.473
course in my fifth year architecture school. And 
some of the social principles and discussion that

24:26.815 --> 24:32.040
were going on in those classes were just, blowing 
my socks off. I mean, it really took me a while to

24:33.858 --> 24:42.987
even be able to be in the same room with some of this 
discussion going on. And while I look back now,

24:43.007 --> 24:57.041
I've gained a lot in the social side of planning and 
the human side of the issues in that experience.

24:57.301 --> 25:01.605
And I think I've broadened tremendously in trying 
see what planning or decision-making really does

25:01.822 --> 25:07.129
to society. And I think it was one key value that I 
got out of playing school, out of the whole thing. I

25:13.877 --> 25:26.853
think it forced me, even though it was 
uncomfortable, and I didn't really feel good

25:13.877 --> 25:26.853
about a lot of things that went on in graduate 
school, because I was being forced in all those

25:13.877 --> 25:26.853
cases to go beyond where I was. And it was a forcing, 
almost a two-year, very rigorous forcing

25:32.011 --> 25:34.534
process. That's what we hope to do. Well, and being 
at A&M, you'd never dream that that would happen. I

25:43.686 --> 25:52.537
think you pressed a lot, Bob, as a person from 
California and looking at where you had been. I

25:52.597 --> 26:01.849
think McGraw and Gardner and a lot of those folks 
were people that were really pushing us Yeah,

26:02.099 --> 26:03.881
yeah. But I think it was valuable. I'm trying to 
think of things that we might move into. One of the

26:11.088 --> 26:20.757
first assignments I had down here was trying to 
coordinate activities going on at the state

26:11.088 --> 26:20.757
level. And the human service business, the 
coordination of planning activities within each

26:21.618 --> 26:31.448
state agency was one of the first assignments I 
had. while having an architecture background,

26:31.833 --> 26:50.631
having, you know, began some of this

26:31.833 --> 26:50.631
acclimation, I might say, of this process, then to 
have one of the first assignments is to deal with

26:31.833 --> 26:50.631
human service agencies was a real challenge to me. 
And I began getting into family planning kinds of

26:51.452 --> 27:01.502
issues, began viewing health planning, what was 
going on in health planning, What did our

27:01.921 --> 27:13.134
human service agencies, what kinds of services 
were being provided, what kind of services at the

27:01.921 --> 27:13.134
health department? It really gave me a bath real 
early of activities at the state level that I had

27:13.415 --> 27:21.364
never been introduced to before. So I guess trying 
to carry where we were back in the 69, 70 era, One of

27:29.512 --> 27:35.502
the key things that were done is we passed a law that 
created the governor as chief planning officer.

27:37.165 --> 27:47.322
It said that the governor shall create 
interagency planning councils to transcend

27:37.165 --> 27:47.322
agencies and concerns. And I think that was when, 
if you want to try to pull that up, it's Article

27:48.243 --> 27:55.435
44.13.32a. And it is a state law that gives a basis 
for the governor being involved in planning,

27:55.955 --> 28:04.284
really. The law back in 69 and 70 talked more 
extensively about interagency planning

28:05.545 --> 28:15.435
councils, what they should be, and so forth. In 75, 
the law was amended to be a little bit more general,

28:15.656 --> 28:24.645
giving the governor some authorities in planning 
expanded some roles, but really got a little bit

28:25.165 --> 28:30.992
more general in the interagency council area. HUD 
required each state to designate a state planning

28:32.113 --> 28:51.375
officer, as I recall, for the transmittal of 
monies and so forth to sign off on plans and

28:32.113 --> 28:51.375
programs that would receive federal grants. And 
most states, in fact, did specify the governor as a

28:52.132 --> 28:58.279
state planning officer. But it didn't 
necessarily follow them. I think that that

29:00.281 --> 29:05.106
happened about the time that you're mentioning 
here. About that same time, in 69, the

29:07.189 --> 29:14.316
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act was passed. 
It was passed actually in 67, I believe. The

29:18.254 --> 29:21.879
Demonstration of Cities and Metropolitan Act was 
passed in 64. And then the National Environmental

29:22.961 --> 29:26.466
Policy Act was passed in 69. All three of those 
laws, national laws, gave the grounding to trying

29:26.807 --> 29:38.404
to create this review function of federal grants. 
And that's really important. You know, that did

29:42.250 --> 29:49.759
occur, and in 69, the division planning 
coordination was designated as the

29:42.250 --> 29:49.759
clearinghouse for federal grants. But I do not 
know that I can verify that because of those

29:50.519 --> 30:12.004
three federal acts and the old Circa 895 being 
created by the Office of Management and Budget as

29:50.519 --> 30:12.004
being a direct mandate for designating the 
governor as chief planning officer. In fact, I

30:12.457 --> 30:15.681
think the governor was actually designated prior 
to that time. But it might have been the mood that

30:15.741 --> 30:19.446
actually came. I think, in fact, that the governor 
chief planning officer occurred in 67. But I would

30:24.192 --> 30:27.796
need to check the actual date on when the law was 
passed. But having the interagency planning

30:28.757 --> 30:38.970
councils, Preston Smith began forming. 
councils, particularly in the health area. As one

30:43.162 --> 30:54.196
of my first areas, the Interagency Health and 
Human Service Council at that time was a

30:43.162 --> 30:54.196
coordinating group of about 18 to 20 human service 
agencies. And the governor would call this

30:54.997 --> 30:59.002
meeting of agency heads. Governor Smith would 
always spend about 15 or 20 minutes opening the

30:59.943 --> 31:05.150
session. He'd tend to leave. then the director of 
the Division of Planning Coordination would be

31:07.368 --> 31:14.176
the guy that pretty well ran the meeting. And we 
have quite a bit of early work in coordinating the

31:14.196 --> 31:23.827
planning efforts occurred through the 
Interagency Planning Councils. That was the

31:24.768 --> 31:27.050
Health and Human Service Council I mentioned. 
There was one that... Does that still exist, the

31:31.496 --> 31:36.181
Interagency Planning Council? No. Not that one. 
There is a... When was that abandoned?

31:47.214 --> 31:47.615
Okay. As governors came in, left and came in, there 
tended to be, you know, an ending of that council

31:49.617 --> 32:00.450
and a recreation of something.

32:03.713 --> 32:06.737
Briscoe, Governor Briscoe began... sort of, let 
me see how I can say it, he began becoming fairly

32:07.342 --> 32:20.861
inactive personally as a governor in interagency 
planning councils. While they continued to

32:20.922 --> 32:33.720
function, his guy was a director of division 
planning coordination, continued to call

32:20.922 --> 32:33.720
meetings and to operate. When the governor didn't 
come personally, agency commissioners began

32:34.527 --> 32:50.128
dropping out, so they began to be slowly but 
surely, without commissioners there, you lose

32:34.527 --> 32:50.128
decision makers, and pretty soon you begin losing 
effectiveness. So I think the latter part of the

32:50.849 --> 33:04.146
Briscoe administration, I'd say 76, was probably 
pretty much the end of the interagency councils in

32:50.849 --> 33:04.146
that administration. That's really about three 
years out of six that they continue to function and

33:04.902 --> 33:13.710
operate. But a director of a division is actually 
calling the meetings and setting up meetings and

33:15.151 --> 33:22.939
so on. So Governor Clements then picked up on, 
quote, the authority and created a group that they

33:33.539 --> 33:35.862
were really the Big 12. And this is a 
cross-functional group. This is natural

33:39.267 --> 33:42.271
resource, human services. It was a group that 
Governor Clements used as the group to initiate

33:42.311 --> 34:02.719
and to operate the employee reduction programs, 
the employee training programs.

34:03.020 --> 34:06.543
I guess it was called Texas State Government 
Effectiveness Program. And this council of the,

34:06.663 --> 34:16.812
quote, big 12 state agencies were used as a forum 
for the governor to kind of implement these

34:06.663 --> 34:16.812
policies. Many of those policies directed 
planning, impacted planning in a very direct way.

34:24.139 --> 34:32.166
But it was not the same kind of functional planning 
coordination work that went on in the early 70s

34:32.686 --> 34:37.972
under the Preston Smith era, under the early days 
of the Briscoe administration. Let me give you an

34:40.034 --> 34:43.638
example of what I think you'll make a little bit 
clearer.

34:47.763 --> 34:50.206
This document I know, Bob, you have seen. It's a 
document that was produced by the Interagency

34:50.266 --> 34:55.892
Council on Natural Resources and the 
Environment. It was a set of guidelines and

34:57.003 --> 35:08.859
procedures for reviewing environmental impact 
statements and for coordinating issues that were

34:57.003 --> 35:08.859
interagency in nature. This document is really a 
policy statement of the agencies directly

35:09.500 --> 35:17.731
involved in natural resources. This was adopted 
May of 75, but it You know, it is a statement. I think

35:30.180 --> 35:35.867
if you go through here and read the policy, it's 
called the Policy for the Environment. It's

35:36.829 --> 35:48.425
actually a signed document saying this is what we 
believe and what we would like to do in trying to

35:36.829 --> 35:48.425
address environmental concerns. This was a far 
reaching document at that time for us. fact that we

35:55.323 --> 36:04.698
still look on it as a basis that we still refer to and 
deal with because it was a policy statement. It did

36:04.738 --> 36:06.240
talk about procedures. It has a statement on the 
planning process. I'm sure Bob will really enjoy

36:11.568 --> 36:15.054
critiquing. I know you've seen this, Bob. Haven't 
you? Have you seen this document? I have. But it did

36:20.602 --> 36:22.225
lay out what was perceived as the planning process 
at that time in trying to make decisions about

36:22.778 --> 36:38.214
whether to construct a state building or a highway 
or a reservoir. This is the process that you go

36:38.894 --> 36:43.959
through in trying to determine whether it's a good 
decision or not. And I guess just to pass on to a

36:44.740 --> 36:52.448
group of planners, this was done primarily 
because the state agencies felt that if they

36:52.867 --> 36:59.775
didn't take matters into their own hands, that the 
feds were going to do it to them. And clearly, you

37:01.017 --> 37:05.662
know, that was the underlying feeling throughout 
this document. I'd like to say it was because we

37:05.682 --> 37:09.427
wanted to do what was good for our state. And I guess 
in a way, you know, you might say that might be a part

37:10.208 --> 37:14.673
of a reason. But at any time or most of the time when 
we had trouble getting some of these things

37:20.390 --> 37:26.238
approved would say, well, you know, if we don't do 
this, then this is going to happen. And it clearly

37:26.899 --> 37:30.964
was a way of trying to get some key things done. But 
this was a product of that council. And it was a

37:34.729 --> 37:48.608
clear, I think, example of how a group of state 
agencies with functional planning

37:34.729 --> 37:48.608
responsibilities get together and try to solve an 
issue that transcends each of the agencies. Yeah,

37:49.263 --> 37:53.730
when would you say that went out of business, or it 
hasn't? This council? Mm-hmm. OK. I mean, the

38:00.300 --> 38:01.382
structure of it. The structure of the council 
became

38:08.703 --> 38:10.205
I'm trying to remember history. And if we get down 
to specific, I'm sure the book will need to,

38:10.225 --> 38:15.371
specifics and dates. I need to get with some 
experts that might give me that. But this council

38:20.197 --> 38:25.404
was actually transformed into a natural resource 
council. They actually deleted the name. And

38:27.426 --> 38:31.191
there was a state law that was passed that created a 
natural resource council. After the natural

38:33.013 --> 38:35.436
resource council was formed, Under whose 
administration?

38:41.173 --> 38:51.305
Well, basically, after Governor Briscoe stopped 
meeting with this council and stopped, it was

38:41.173 --> 38:51.305
obvious that there needed to be some other 
vehicle. The state law was passed, which created

38:52.426 --> 38:55.830
this Natural Resources Council. And then, 
really, the major piece came about to create the

38:57.031 --> 39:06.182
Texas Energy and Natural Resources Advisory 
Council, the 10-rank. agency you need to pull that

39:06.382 --> 39:35.359
law because that law really was the was the major 
piece that transcended this council there were

39:06.382 --> 39:35.359
some interim things between this and uh and that 
agency but that agency was actually created uh

39:06.382 --> 39:35.359
very late in briscoe administration i think 
probably around uh just just trying to recall 78

39:06.382 --> 39:35.359
probably 77 or 78 Did the membership stay the same? 
No. See, when it was created as the Texas Energy and

39:39.678 --> 39:46.927
Natural Resource Advisory Council, it did 
change. We'd need to compare, but we could clearly

39:47.288 --> 39:51.133
do that for you. I mean, the members are signatory 
to this. And then the TNRAC agency. I think the

39:57.861 --> 40:05.430
TNRAC agency began drawing in such entities as the 
Attorney General's Office, some other people

40:05.630 --> 40:13.781
that were directly concerned about energy that 
were not a part of this entity. I think, for

40:13.801 --> 40:21.811
example, the TNRAC, the co-chairmanship of TNRAC 
was the governor and the lieutenant governor. The

40:22.472 --> 40:23.954
lieutenant governor wasn't a part. See, the 
legislative side, was not a part of this effort at

40:26.167 --> 40:28.330
all. And then when we began having this new 
creature of the TNRAC, we began seeing the

40:28.410 --> 40:43.191
legislative side very much a predominant actor in 
the thing. So I think as far as planning policy,

40:43.211 --> 40:50.921
there are several things that we'd need to look at. 
We'd need to track, see, this work of this council

40:56.153 --> 41:00.779
went back to probably early 70s, 70, 71. There are 
key people that I could identify that could give

41:02.361 --> 41:13.836
you the nuts and bolts of what happened in the 
beginning of 71, 72, depending on how far you feel

41:02.361 --> 41:13.836
like you need to go. Joe Harris is one that I would 
quickly refer you to as a key actor. and under

41:22.242 --> 41:30.470
Preston Smith of the Interagency Natural 
Resource Council, this long title. John Gosden

41:30.570 --> 41:41.720
was a staffer under Joe Harris, and John's still 
here, and could pass on some additional detail

41:30.570 --> 41:41.720
about the Natural Resource Council.

41:44.803 --> 41:52.030
The other kinds of councils that were formed 
during those years, there was a transportation

41:44.803 --> 41:52.030
council. And at that time, we had a separate mass 
transportation agency. We had the Aeronautics

41:58.356 --> 41:59.457
Commission. We had the Highway Department. We had 
TTI over at A&M as a participant. The council over

42:07.249 --> 42:13.379
at University of Texas dealing with 
transportation was a participant. At that time,

42:13.399 --> 42:17.325
because mass transit agency was separate, It 
clearly needed to be a council of transportation

42:17.778 --> 42:25.725
agencies to deal with issues. After, I don't know 
what time in the 70s, but the Mass Transportation

42:25.745 --> 42:34.393
Agency was transformed as a part of the Highway 
Department. It became a little bit less of a reason

42:34.473 --> 42:47.025
to try to coordinate because the agency was pretty 
much a public transportation type agency. There

42:47.984 --> 42:56.752
are still people over TTI that believe there needs 
to be a transportation council to help coordinate

42:47.984 --> 42:56.752
policy in the transportation business.

43:00.115 --> 43:01.757
Who's on your faculty now? Virgil. Virgil's very 
interested still in some form of a transportation

43:03.359 --> 43:17.552
council that might be a forum for transportation 
policy.

43:18.157 --> 43:24.367
executive director of AIP, who then went to UMTA. 
Who am I trying to recall? Well, he went from San

43:27.893 --> 43:32.000
Diego, actually. But it doesn't matter. But at 
that time, UMTA was very strong within DOT. And

43:39.332 --> 43:42.477
they had quite a bit of money during that era. And I 
think that that was one of the reasons why people

43:43.368 --> 43:51.481
were getting pretty enthusiastic about forming 
councils. Now, the money's sort of dried up.

43:55.146 --> 44:00.635
Around 75 was the end of the Transportation 
Council. And there's really nothing since then

44:00.855 --> 44:06.444
that even looks like that. One thing I wanted to ask 
you was, What was John Shanahan's role with state

44:11.161 --> 44:16.828
planning?

44:17.369 --> 44:18.410
John was before me. John, shortly after, or maybe 
before I came on, John left. I see. John, I don't

44:25.840 --> 44:28.743
even know that John was here any time that I was. A 
very short time, if he was. I remember coming up as a

44:34.290 --> 44:40.358
student and seeing where John was officed. on the 
first floors of this building and meeting him

44:40.810 --> 44:45.495
again. Of course, he was over at school in my early 
years of planning school. But to my knowledge, I

44:50.902 --> 45:00.673
really don't know where he left it and what role he 
might have played in some of the goals for

44:50.902 --> 45:00.673
programs. I think that would have been a 
contribution if he did. I believe, as John will

45:06.460 --> 45:08.522
tell us, One of the key things, my perspective was, 
one of the key things that that division did, they

45:08.570 --> 45:18.821
began looking at housing programs early on. That 
was one of the early things that they were looking

45:19.142 --> 45:24.548
at, partially maybe because of HUD funding. But I 
think shortly after John left, one of the key

45:25.369 --> 45:38.323
things that they did was begin developing a 
housing program and housing planning function.

45:39.147 --> 45:57.488
Well, the next person I wanted to ask you to comment 
on is Mary Lou Henry and others who were involved in

45:39.147 --> 45:57.488
the state's

45:39.147 --> 45:57.488
review council to certify 701 planners. Okay. And 
Texas was way ahead in most states in

45:58.108 --> 46:08.580
providing some minimum level of guarantee to the 
citizens responsible planning would take place

46:08.915 --> 46:14.345
under the 701 program. OK. Let me plead ignorance a 
little bit to this. From day one, my involvement,

46:18.672 --> 46:26.766
701 planning, and that was one of the activities 
that we were involved in when I first started. It

46:27.488 --> 46:32.256
was a source of funding and developing an overall 
program design for the office. and trying to

46:32.759 --> 46:41.549
develop a planning framework and a set of goals and 
objectives for the agency and so on. A piece of

46:42.269 --> 46:51.600
funding came to the governor's office for 
statewide planning and working with regional

46:42.269 --> 46:51.600
councils and developing a regional planning 
process. And the other piece went to the Texas

46:52.461 --> 47:00.910
Department of Community Affairs after 1971, 
after this agency was formed. And one of the first

47:01.430 --> 47:15.009
roles they had was to allocate that planning money 
out to communities across Texas for the local

47:01.430 --> 47:15.009
planning function. So they became the 
administering agency for that local pot of funds.

47:20.436 --> 47:26.104
We continued through the years to work closely 
with the Texas Department of Community Affairs.
