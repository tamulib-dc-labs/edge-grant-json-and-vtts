00:02.461 --> 00:09.411
There

00:02.461 --> 00:09.411
have been some improvements. It's interesting. 
Sam Snead said the most improvement that you have

00:10.392 --> 00:15.119
is in the golf ball. He would take a wood wood and a 
new ball, and he'd take a metal wood and a new ball,

00:15.139 --> 00:24.773
and he'd hit them pretty much the same distance. 
and demonstrate it isn't the club as much as it is

00:25.394 --> 00:29.219
the ball. But there have been some definite 
improvements on it. I think your clubs come out

00:32.263 --> 00:35.427
more the same. There is much more of a demand and a 
stress on having very high quality as far as not

00:35.548 --> 00:45.781
being deviating a lot. And that's helped a lot in 
consistency. But the

00:48.084 --> 00:54.473
main thing actually is just

00:58.638 --> 01:21.670
The amount of them, the amount of schools for these

00:58.638 --> 01:21.670
young people to go to, golf schools, I mean, 
they're off in the summertime or holidays, and the

00:58.638 --> 01:21.670
instruction at these schools, and the 
instruction level with PGA professionals has

00:58.638 --> 01:21.670
just really improved. You can become a better 
player with the help of these people who really

01:21.690 --> 01:23.312
learn it. And I think that's

01:23.933 --> 01:34.213
where

01:23.933 --> 01:34.213
you've seen really the biggest improvement. The 
equipment to some degree, but the instruction,

01:34.835 --> 01:37.380
the opportunity to compete, that makes the best 
player. If you have to compete one against one,

01:37.400 --> 01:39.664
you're going to improve a lot.

01:53.718 --> 02:12.997
I really, when I think about this, and this is going 
to go counter where a lot of people think, but the

01:53.718 --> 02:12.997
first ones that I had in the middle 70s, some of 
these kids with cancer were just really, really

01:53.718 --> 02:12.997
tough. In the 70s, a lot of kids with cancer, they 
were tough to deal with. And they lied to you a lot.

02:16.901 --> 02:18.002
They were hard to deal with. And as I went along, 
they got a little better in the 80s. And I'm not

02:21.325 --> 02:23.388
saying always. I don't want to color Danny and some 
of these kids up. Some of them are just real good. He

02:29.856 --> 02:32.479
has about since 1990. I don't know what it is, but 
the kids have changed, and they're better. And I

02:37.065 --> 02:38.707
think they've been getting better. I always tell 
people who come up to me and say, boy, Coach, you've

02:38.727 --> 02:43.833
got great kids. It's because they've got great 
parents. And I think parents are doing a better job

02:46.196 --> 02:47.558
with their kids. I think the kids now are better 
than what they were.

02:59.665 --> 03:03.711
Well, it's definitely

02:59.665 --> 03:03.711
improved. I remember we used to go to Guadalajara. 
In fact, we won it. There was a golf course. It was

03:10.001 --> 03:12.265
really a big time thing in 1980. All the major 
schools were there. I remember we were paired

03:16.892 --> 03:23.343
against Oklahoma State, Bob Clay, and these 
people would beat us. He was a great player. We beat

03:24.525 --> 03:24.905
them. They shot 878. And individually,

03:26.513 --> 03:35.365
I believe it was 218 won the tournament.

03:38.990 --> 03:42.615
That was 1980. In 1986, we went there. 840, we shot 
844

03:44.678 --> 03:50.366
going forward. 201 won individually. And you say, 
well, it had to have been, you know, different.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.064
Now, we play a Guadalajara-type club. The weather 
is always the same. Now, Rafael Arcon, he changed

04:00.368 --> 04:05.355
the team placement somewhat, but they still kept 
it much. Some of those things might have been at the

04:05.435 --> 04:09.581
end, but the golf course is still the same. The 
conditions are still the same. Largely, the

04:11.884 --> 04:17.592
player had improved that much in that period of 
time. And you can see it now. I mean, the scores,

04:19.495 --> 04:20.837
when I played Dallas Athletics, Thank you.

20:16.837 --> 20:23.792
Is there any other team that golf

20:16.837 --> 20:23.792
or any other sports group that golfers know?

21:24.775 --> 21:33.946
And

21:24.775 --> 21:33.946
you know he did it. What was the punishment?

22:42.215 --> 22:47.483
Did

22:42.215 --> 22:47.483
you go over in those six or five sessions, did you do 
that?
