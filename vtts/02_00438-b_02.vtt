00:04.216 --> 00:05.979
I got a call from the captain of the ship. He wanted 
to see me. I was just getting ready to go to bed. Been

00:09.984 --> 00:12.107
up for probably 18 hours.

00:15.051 --> 00:27.770
I walked up to his office, and he showed me a long 
teletype news release that had gone, had been

00:15.051 --> 00:27.770
released. Now, there were lots of reporters 
aboard our ship, okay? I don't have any idea how

00:31.114 --> 00:32.316
many. but all kinds of reporters aboard our ship. 
And they were able to send out over teletype news

00:36.062 --> 00:45.573
releases, as they should have been. But he asked 
me, he says, did you talk to this guy? Did you say

00:52.420 --> 00:53.321
this? And I said, well, let me read it and see what it 
is first. I said, first of all, I hadn't talked to

00:56.545 --> 00:58.047
anybody. I read it, and Here was a news release 
telling about what I had done that day, how I had

01:02.114 --> 01:11.609
gone into Vietnam, what I had done, and so on and so 
forth. Biggest bunch of crap you have ever laid

01:11.629 --> 01:14.914
your eyes on. Here's what we surmised had 
happened. There is a bulletin board on the ship

01:21.405 --> 01:29.117
that has the plan of the day, and it has a command 
roster on there. And I was the senior Marine aboard

01:30.160 --> 01:32.804
this ship.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.833
And I was CO of troops. My battalion was aboard. 
There was two and a half helicopter squadrons

01:42.418 --> 01:46.664
aboard. But I was a senior Marine. And so this guy, 
wanting to get a story, assumed that I had gone

01:48.927 --> 01:56.218
ashore. The battalion that actually did the work 
had gone, off of another ship he was not aboard my

02:00.029 --> 02:27.336
ship this guy took my name and blt19 was what i 
commanded at that time and he simply wrote a story

02:00.029 --> 02:27.336
out

02:00.029 --> 02:27.336
purely out of his own head now if he had not been 
stupid he would have known that i had not gone

02:00.029 --> 02:27.336
ashore

02:31.163 --> 02:39.395
What I'm saying is these young reporters

02:31.163 --> 02:39.395
made their money. That was their job. I mean, they 
didn't, a lot of them, didn't get paid unless they

02:41.137 --> 02:55.799
had so many column inches or so many minutes of 
video time.

02:55.819 --> 02:58.723
When I was in Vietnam proper the first time, Most of 
the time, we weren't bothered with reporters too

03:00.425 --> 03:06.432
much, because we were really doing the mundane 
thing. And who wants to hear about the

03:07.212 --> 03:15.261
type thing that we were doing? But when we got to Khe 
Sanh, that was another matter. Boy, they used to

03:19.806 --> 03:26.854
fly in there on anything that they could get a ride 
on. And they'd get off of one of those airplanes,

03:28.505 --> 03:40.818
and they'd grab the first guy they could find, 
hopefully, to see a responsible person. And they

03:42.039 --> 03:52.731
wanted your name, your organization, but that 
really is about all they wanted, because they

03:42.039 --> 03:52.731
wrote the rest of their story on crap.

03:53.552 --> 03:57.516
They already had their minds made up what they were 
going to write about, and that's how you get So much

03:59.133 --> 04:16.515
of the stuff that I said, you know, you would think 
that we would have found 300 people in our barbed

03:59.133 --> 04:16.515
wire every morning because of the assaults on the 
base. And it just didn't happen. Well, who wants to

04:19.639 --> 04:28.870
write about they spent their night in their bunker 
being shelled by artillery and rockets all night?

04:29.592 --> 04:30.674
That doesn't read very well. And as a result of 
that, they didn't want to write it. But the media

04:36.947 --> 04:40.293
was terrible. I can't emphasize that enough. 
They'd get in your way. They wanted to be in places

04:48.830 --> 04:51.195
where they shouldn't be.

04:58.938 --> 05:06.189
I kind of like the way General Schwarzkopf handled 
them in Desert Storm.

05:06.209 --> 05:18.648
And I realize that that might sound as though 
there's a conflict in believing that we have the

05:06.209 --> 05:18.648
right to do all these things and then we're going to 
restrict. I do not think that there should be

05:18.708 --> 05:24.777
censors per se. There should be available at some 
point all the information so that history can be

05:28.098 --> 05:35.209
correct. But there should not be information that 
would allow, well, the latest is over in Somalia,

05:36.631 --> 05:46.987
allow the press to be waiting when the Marines 
land. Now, as it turned out, that didn't hurt

05:48.550 --> 05:50.813
anything. But it could have. It could have created 
all sorts of things. And my position is this. Why

06:00.784 --> 06:17.880
should I place my Marines in added danger just so 
some jerk can write a column, can be the first one to

06:00.784 --> 06:17.880
get some information back to a newspaper? Now, 
does it matter whether that news was shown on

06:17.900 --> 06:26.168
today's 6 o'clock news or day after tomorrow? Not 
one iota.

06:31.851 --> 06:37.696
What is important is that it be truthful if and when 
it does get to the news. Not when it gets there, but

06:37.776 --> 06:41.600
that it is the truth when it gets there. I suppose 
handling the media has got to rank almost equal in

06:43.341 --> 06:55.311
importance to your fire support plan. And that's 
terrible. A commander should not have to worry

06:58.615 --> 07:02.680
about newspaper people.

07:05.684 --> 07:14.856
He should be able to concentrate on saving the 
lives of his people. That should be his most

07:14.876 --> 07:19.723
important mission. And it's not anymore. And 
that's terrible. And I won't forgive him for that.

07:30.458 --> 07:38.047
From some of the things that you've indicated, I 
think you feel that a lot of people misunderstand

07:30.458 --> 07:38.047
Vietnam. No doubt about it. What would you like for 
future generations to understand about Vietnam?

07:45.456 --> 07:51.183
Well, that's

07:45.456 --> 07:51.183
a pretty broad question. I would like for people to 
understand that a large number of Americans

07:59.922 --> 08:13.134
went to a country that they didn't understand. 
They

08:13.194 --> 08:21.221
went there because the commander in chief sent 
them there.

08:24.404 --> 08:29.929
And that probably 99% of them did a tremendous job.

08:34.077 --> 08:44.671
And they

08:34.077 --> 08:44.671
were as brave as any other American fighting force 
has ever been. They

08:44.711 --> 09:01.372
did this without the support back home that all 
other wars had had. And that includes Corita, too.

09:03.777 --> 09:09.024
Basically, our people in Korea were supported 
back home.

09:13.529 --> 09:28.148
That it was predominantly a guerrilla war, one of 
which really US forces are not well suited for in

09:13.529 --> 09:28.148
the way of organization, equipment, so on and so 
forth.

09:32.650 --> 09:36.434
And that they did their duty as they saw it.

09:40.799 --> 09:53.973
I don't think that the vast majority of us have any 
reason to believe that we have to share the blame,

09:40.799 --> 09:53.973
the responsibility for the few like the My Lai 
Massacre and so forth. Those were criminal acts

09:54.393 --> 10:00.700
done by criminals.

10:01.287 --> 10:17.243
And I don't think the United States Army, for 
instance, should feel as though there's a special

10:01.287 --> 10:17.243
responsibility or a

10:01.287 --> 10:17.243
black mark on them for this. This was done by an 
inept criminal. And they finally did try and so

10:21.507 --> 10:23.890
forth. But what would I want the people to believe?

10:32.692 --> 10:48.065
That young men did

10:32.692 --> 10:48.065
a tough, dirty job.

10:50.507 --> 10:54.731
It's always the young men that really pay the 
ultimate price. I was 36 years old. when I was there

11:02.425 --> 11:03.866
the first time. I wasn't a kid.

11:08.571 --> 11:15.899
It's the young 18, 19, 20 year old man that pays the 
price. But I think it's part of that wall I alluded

11:16.739 --> 11:26.730
to before.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.192
They stand as a part of what we are as people.

11:39.227 --> 11:42.411
And they have every reason to be proud of it. And we 
have stood up against what we thought was wrong,

11:43.112 --> 11:54.589
generally referred to as communism for the last 50 
years.

11:58.450 --> 12:02.756
The things that we've done has not necessarily 
been popular and it has never been pleasant.

12:05.820 --> 12:12.308
And the brunt of that has always been on the 
shoulder of the young men. But that's what makes us

12:13.770 --> 12:16.053
a great nation.

12:19.077 --> 12:27.107
And I think, if you'll allow,

12:19.077 --> 12:27.107
people often

12:30.732 --> 12:38.399
get the wrong idea when they think of and talk about 
freedom.

12:38.419 --> 12:43.163
Maybe the word itself lends itself to that. 
Because it starts off with free and leads a lot of

12:44.905 --> 12:49.950
people to think that it didn't cost anything.

12:54.554 --> 12:55.214
That's not true.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.199
It cost a lot.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.865
And you know who it cost? The young man, the young 
soldier, the young sailor, the young Marine.

13:20.906 --> 13:30.760
The air effort, which I don't have any firsthand 
knowledge of, of course, in this war, probably is

13:20.906 --> 13:30.760
different from any other. in that almost all of our 
prisoners of war were aviators, were pilots. In

13:40.451 --> 13:54.008
other wars, with the exception of the early part of 
the European war, aviators were fairly safe. And

13:56.011 --> 14:01.978
large numbers were not taken prisoners and so 
forth. And we haven't touched on that, but you

14:02.262 --> 14:10.813
know, I think the people who paid the greatest 
price of all were our prisoners of war.

14:14.518 --> 14:20.326
And almost all of those were officers, and almost 
all of them were eight years.

14:25.272 --> 14:29.518
I have a great deal of respect for them, for what 
they had to go through.

14:34.763 --> 15:01.240
If you allow me to just go back a bit to the media, 
what the media has done to the families of what we

14:34.763 --> 15:01.240
now still show is missing in action is absolutely 
criminal.

15:01.260 --> 15:02.121
Absolutely criminal. They go over and they get 
pictures and so on and so forth and they get little

15:03.400 --> 15:18.499
bits and pieces and then go back and prey on the 
families of these guys who have long since been

15:03.400 --> 15:18.499
dead.

15:21.003 --> 15:26.189
It is absolutely criminal.

15:26.209 --> 15:29.053
I cannot fathom any

15:32.003 --> 15:51.936
responsible military officer who ever would have 
had any kind of intelligence information about us

15:32.003 --> 15:51.936
having live people over there that would have ever 
been quiet about it or not taken appropriate

15:32.003 --> 15:51.936
action. And I cannot fathom our politicians And by 
that, I mean our presidents, the two presidents

15:58.244 --> 16:16.715
that were involved in this

15:58.244 --> 16:16.715
ever making any kind of behind the scene deal that 
would have left, you know, X number of our

15:58.244 --> 16:16.715
prisoners over there for peace. I mean, I reject 
that outright. First of all, he can't do it in the

16:21.002 --> 16:23.606
vacuum. There would have been lots of Not lots, but 
there would have been enough military people in on

16:25.565 --> 16:30.151
that sort of thing. And I have enough pride in them. 
They'd

16:36.479 --> 16:47.373
have never stood still for it.

16:47.393 --> 16:50.998
But the media, and this is a small part of the media. 
are going to suck this thing for as long as they can

16:52.295 --> 16:59.025
make money on it. And if you think that there's any 
other motivation behind what they're doing than

16:59.045 --> 17:10.483
money, then you're crazy as a bed bug. It is 
money-oriented. And it's making these people

17:13.848 --> 17:19.336
suffer again and again and again. They've 
suffered enough. Leave them alone. Anyway. Is

17:25.936 --> 17:32.786
there anything that I haven't asked you about that 
you just want to talk about?

17:32.806 --> 17:36.672
Well, I alluded to the prisoners.

17:42.320 --> 17:48.188
The suffering that they went through is

17:42.320 --> 17:48.188
almost unimaginable. If you haven't read some of 
the books that some of these guys have written, you

17:49.741 --> 17:56.927
should do so. Because there were some real heroes.

18:10.339 --> 18:17.145
And I suspect that

18:10.339 --> 18:17.145
for most of us, Whatever effect that the Vietnam 
War had on us has probably dissipated to the point

18:18.998 --> 18:35.741
to where it's just one of those things that 
happened in our earlier life. But I don't think

18:36.181 --> 18:38.785
it's done this with the prisoners yet.

18:41.789 --> 18:46.255
I suspect that they're still paying for a lot of 
that. I guess the only other thing that I would say

18:47.838 --> 19:09.940
is that there was an awful lot written and there was 
a lot of people got on the so-called bandwagon

18:47.838 --> 19:09.940
about the post-trauma syndrome that a lot of the 
Vietnamese veterans suffered from. I don't know.

19:11.762 --> 19:17.187
There was a time when I thought that entire thing 
was a bunch of bunk. And

19:18.719 --> 19:30.533
I truly felt that most of the people that was 
claiming that was just doing so for a free ride. But

19:31.774 --> 19:40.504
I guess the reason I arrived at that conclusion is 
that at one point there was about 550,000 men over

19:31.774 --> 19:40.504
there. But out of that 550,000 men that was in 
Vietnam, Only about 100,000 are what you would

19:48.284 --> 19:55.576
actually call combat troops. The rest of them were 
eating three hot meals a day out of a mess hall, were

19:55.596 --> 20:14.308
sleeping in either a tent that had

19:55.596 --> 20:14.308
been specially prepared with wooden decks and so 
on and so forth, that were going to px's and clubs

20:14.828 --> 20:43.570
and going to movies every night so the vast 
majority of the experiences about four-fifths of

20:14.828 --> 20:43.570
the stories that you would get would be totally 
different from what i told you because it was from

20:14.828 --> 20:43.570
the you know work eight or ten hours a day and then 
sleep the rest of the time in reasonable safety

20:45.085 --> 20:52.152
Every now and then, the Viet Cong would come around 
and would throw a few mortar rounds in some of these

20:45.085 --> 20:52.152
big bases. Some of the big bases down around Saigon 
had swimming pools, Olympic-sized swimming

20:52.492 --> 20:58.118
pools.

21:03.002 --> 21:14.974
Now, I don't put any credence whatsoever

21:03.002 --> 21:14.974
to the experience that the four-fifths of the 
people involved in that sort of thing have The

21:15.629 --> 21:34.476
young soldier who was in the combat unit

21:15.629 --> 21:34.476
probably worked as hard and endured as much 
hardship as 90% of them ever did in other wars. So to

21:35.337 --> 21:40.365
that group of people, I truly take my hat off. To the 
four-fifths, and they're the ones that do the most

21:40.385 --> 21:44.050
talking, and tell the most exaggerated stories 
about Vietnam, I say, it's a bunch of garbage. I

21:55.159 --> 21:59.484
have sat and listened to these stories in the past. 
And finally, you know, just saying, oh, by the way,

22:01.286 --> 22:12.077
what outfit were you with when you were in Vietnam?

22:12.097 --> 22:13.699
And in almost every case, It would be some 
headquarters guy that got three hot meals a day and

22:13.949 --> 22:20.275
slept between sheets.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.764
So I don't put any stop for it whatsoever. I can tell 
you this, and this is all that I know for sure, all

22:28.784 --> 22:37.393
the other something that I've been told. But I know 
for a fact that the people of the 2nd Battalion 26

22:37.413 --> 22:41.357
Marines in the seven months that I was there did not 
have one single solitary day off. Not one.

22:57.838 --> 23:10.917
They were up patrolling or doing something until 
we got to Quezon when we just sat there all day long

22:57.838 --> 23:10.917
on patrol or ambush or something all night long. 
Probably did not average more than three or four

23:15.678 --> 23:17.300
hours sleep.

23:21.065 --> 23:31.599
Now,

23:21.065 --> 23:31.599
I don't know what kind of effect, long-term 
effect, that had on them.

23:31.619 --> 23:32.600
Probably not good. I finally did come to the 
conclusion that some of that's real. But the vast

23:39.770 --> 23:43.875
majority of it's not. The vast majority of it is 
not.

23:49.023 --> 23:52.519
I appreciate this so much.
