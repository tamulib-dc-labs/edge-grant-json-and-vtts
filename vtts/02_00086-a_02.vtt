00:02.393 --> 00:21.415
In the late 30s with cable tool and eventually with rotary rigs and so on, a great deal of that population that filled up that town that went from 800 people to 4,000 people in a very short period of time were from Kilgore, Gladewater,

00:21.395 --> 00:26.205
over in that part of the day.

00:26.225 --> 00:29.713
Plus they were from Enid and Ponca City and that.

00:29.733 --> 00:35.866
So I went to school with kids who grew up whose parents were Texans or Oklahomans.

00:36.327 --> 00:40.315
So words like no count, fixin', carry me,

00:40.987 --> 00:53.083
which were not the Dialogues of Illinois, were the Dialogues that I took with me to the University of Illinois, and a lot of folks thought I was from the Deep South, and why I wasn't, it's just that I grew up with kids, and this wore off.

00:53.665 --> 00:55.671
So when I came down here,

00:56.242 --> 01:09.704
The kids that were in my class really were much more like the kids I grew up with than the kids I went to school with in Champaign, because those kids were all upstate kids.

01:10.025 --> 01:13.170
The bulk of them probably were from the Cook County area.

01:13.150 --> 01:27.848
So I felt fairly comfortable and maybe that was part of the attraction was this community here was more like a rural community that my wife grew up in Monmouth, Illinois on the farm and the way I grew up.

01:27.868 --> 01:29.850
So I didn't have any problem with that.

01:29.930 --> 01:35.277
Now I think the traditions, the Aggie traditions, you know,

01:35.257 --> 01:48.113
wearing the lipstick before the T-Sip game and putting the spikes, the bottle caps on your shoes before the SMU game and doing bonfire and Yale practice and all that.

01:48.133 --> 01:52.739
I think those, but that gets anybody, I think, a change.

01:53.500 --> 01:58.106
Early on, did any student attempt any kind of Aggie prank in your class?

01:58.126 --> 01:59.247
No, I had no pranks.

01:59.267 --> 02:02.030
There were no Aggie pranks in my class at all.

02:02.050 --> 02:03.132
As you started grading?

02:03.152 --> 02:04.133
That I knew of.

02:05.041 --> 02:11.524
As you started grading papers the first few semesters, what was your impression of their quality, academic quality?

02:11.588 --> 02:15.192
Oh, I felt comfortable with the quality.

02:15.212 --> 02:15.692
They could write.

02:15.752 --> 02:16.994
I gave all SA exams.

02:17.735 --> 02:19.637
Compared to what you'd known at Illinois?

02:19.657 --> 02:21.959
At Illinois, not much different.

02:21.979 --> 02:24.422
No, I didn't find that.

02:26.084 --> 02:36.735
Oh, you'd find some places where it'd be difficult for them to express themselves, but they have that today, and I have a feeling if I went to the University of Illinois they might have it there as well.

02:37.188 --> 02:42.055
Now the, and the college business at that point was comparatively small.

02:42.075 --> 02:43.156
Yeah, there were about forty.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.239
Forty faculty, I think, probably.

02:46.281 --> 02:46.401
Okay.

02:47.042 --> 02:55.274
And do, were you all, was it obvious that people were dreaming that it was going to grow and progress?

02:55.314 --> 02:56.435
I don't think it was obvious.

02:56.535 --> 03:00.161
I think, I think there was an expectation.

03:01.923 --> 03:04.647
But, you know, here I, keep in mind I,

03:05.943 --> 03:10.490
As a young shavetail, I wasn't interested in what was going on up there.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.036
I came ABD, I had to get my degree out of the way.

03:17.059 --> 03:24.951
John Pearson was wanting us to look for summer money, and so I began to get involved that very year.

03:25.011 --> 03:33.503
In the fall of 69, the following year, I started getting involved in the second half of the summer of 69, I started getting involved in the Sea Grant program.

03:34.394 --> 03:58.029
And through Jim McNeil and I, we got some money, and I got some money to get funded in 69, and so I spent the next 10 years almost, or next, yeah, close to 69, from 69 to 75, spending most of my time, six, seven years, with my nose down in the Sea Grant program.

03:58.049 --> 03:58.930
Describe that effort.

03:59.611 --> 04:04.198
Well, John Calhoun had been kind of the,

04:04.533 --> 04:09.281
the ramrod of this and helped get the Sea Grant program here.

04:10.563 --> 04:13.207
Of course, he and John Pearson were close friends.

04:17.514 --> 04:23.604
John came and said, you know, Sam, you guys need to see what you can do to get some research money out of this.

04:23.824 --> 04:27.891
So I went out to

04:27.871 --> 04:46.622
Some out here at the Bryan plant, Errol Air Force plant out here, and there was a guy by the name of Meineke, I think it was, Minke, out of food science or food technology, and he was grinding up old whiting off the Pacific coast and grinding it up and trying to reduce it down into food protein concentrate.

04:47.547 --> 05:05.235
and the idea was we're going to take this fish protein and we're going to feed the world because here's all this underutilized species these trash fish that comes up in the trawls and gets thrown overboard and the other fish eat them why can't we save them take this protein and we can make a fish fire and

05:05.755 --> 05:33.720
Well, uh, that, uh, uh, I started looking at that stuff and, uh, realized that, uh, first it's not soluble in water, which makes it kind of hard to make flour out of it, and I began to read a lot about it from the testimonies about fish protein concentrate that were going on in, in the Congress at that time, and so it was clear that we had to do something else, and so I,

05:33.700 --> 05:41.938
I began to focus on the state of Texas a little bit more and I began to look at the marketing channels for seafood in the state of Texas.

05:42.018 --> 05:48.773
I began to look at the consumers' attitudes towards seafood in the state of Texas and got some publications and got some visibility.

05:49.259 --> 06:04.922
did some programs in Washington and I think that helped John like that and the next thing you know I began getting more raises and and in fact in 1972 I was recognized the outstanding research in the College of Business.

06:05.763 --> 06:09.728
Now, you came here at what rank?

06:09.748 --> 06:10.248
Assistant.

06:10.268 --> 06:10.769
Assistant.

06:11.389 --> 06:15.795
And I made associate, I think, in 74, I want to think, maybe 74, 75.

06:15.835 --> 06:19.359
Maybe, yeah, 72 or 73, 73.

06:21.121 --> 06:29.290
Were there, in those years, were there pretty regularly annual increases?

06:30.417 --> 06:32.441
Yeah, the increases.

06:32.802 --> 06:37.432
John was able and the university was able to begin, I think, to argue for more money.

06:38.234 --> 06:43.946
Apparently, the university was wanting to grow, and so the legislature was every so often, every two years, was going to give money.

06:44.006 --> 06:44.508
I can remember.

06:45.410 --> 06:50.721
I got a raise, of course, in September, and then I got a raise in December.

06:52.372 --> 06:57.345
So I got a mid-year raise of $100 a month or $150 a month, blew me away.

06:57.747 --> 06:59.912
And then you turn around and you know in August you get another way.

06:59.932 --> 07:03.061
So in essence, you got three raises in a year, unheard of.

07:03.582 --> 07:08.676
And then the state of Texas, bless her heart, had so much money left over that they picked up our Social Security.

07:09.736 --> 07:19.991
Now, that was great if a person could think a little bit that that's like an income, you know, that's a $1,600 or $1,700 raise.

07:20.012 --> 07:21.514
But it didn't show up as a raise, see?

07:21.914 --> 07:31.609
And so it was a pretty hard sell to people that you were attracting in that you didn't have to pay any Social Security because some of these people couldn't run a number.

07:32.247 --> 07:35.656
But golly, what a heck of a deal.

07:35.917 --> 07:42.696
As far as you understood in the department and the college, raises were merit based.

07:43.064 --> 07:45.948
I take it they were merit-based, yeah.

07:45.968 --> 07:48.191
You know, I never, I guess they were.

07:48.211 --> 07:56.923
I never known that, I didn't ever know that I wasn't doing a good job, but I never had anybody come down and pat me on the back and say, man you're doing just what we want you to do.

07:57.023 --> 08:03.391
Did anybody give you, either in writing or orally, any kind of annual appraisal?

08:03.612 --> 08:03.832
No.

08:04.152 --> 08:06.936
We had no reviews as we do now.

08:06.976 --> 08:08.098
We had no reviews.

08:08.118 --> 08:09.920
You just got it.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.342
Were they being done you think?

08:12.263 --> 08:12.784
I don't know.

08:13.270 --> 08:19.219
I don't, I probably not because I became department head and I didn't have to do them.

08:19.239 --> 08:26.429
What, you know, everything almost was student credit hour driven.

08:27.490 --> 08:36.323
If your department generated a lot of student credit hours, you were probably going to get, because the merit money came to the dean and the dean handed it out not for individuals in the department.

08:36.343 --> 08:39.347
He gave it out to the departments and looked at previous budgets.

08:39.468 --> 08:43.193
And when I became department head in 75,

08:43.848 --> 08:52.163
It took me one iteration of the budget to realize it didn't matter what I put down there.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.646
It really didn't matter what I put down there.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.469
It was whatever John Pearson wanted to give me.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.773
And I could write eloquently.

08:58.563 --> 09:00.445
And I thought, all right, but it wouldn't mean any money.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.406
It wouldn't mean.

09:01.426 --> 09:11.675
And so the next year, I just told my secretary, take last year's budget, put the same words in there, just add 8% or 10% to it and send it in.

09:12.135 --> 09:12.996
And that's exactly what.

09:13.316 --> 09:16.799
And I'd get back and I'd get my relative share of what everybody else got.

09:17.039 --> 09:18.301
And I saw what everybody else got.

09:18.321 --> 09:20.523
And so I knew what the game was.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.665
It's not that way now.

09:23.765 --> 09:27.709
But in those days, it was pretty just cut and dry.

09:28.212 --> 09:55.823
how long did it take you to begin to feel sentimentally attached to the to this place whether it be the department the college or the institution sentimentally attached that grows because i presume when you arrived you were not you hadn't thought about whether or not you were going to be here forever no but i didn't even think about it uh i'm not a mover no but you know i i had no intentions of moving i

09:56.174 --> 10:02.764
You know, at no time did I ever inquire about another school.

10:04.106 --> 10:12.759
You know, they were taking very good care of us dollars and cents wise up through, I would say, 1980 maybe, as late as 1980.

10:12.879 --> 10:20.410
During your first years, what did you see of the administration beyond the dean?

10:20.525 --> 10:31.543
I didn't see much beyond the people who were provosts and social provosts.

10:31.563 --> 10:33.666
There was a fellow, is it Suttles?

10:33.766 --> 10:34.868
What was the guy's name?

10:34.888 --> 10:36.030
Andy Suttles was the director.

10:36.090 --> 10:37.693
He was the director for research.

10:37.713 --> 10:38.274
Research.

10:40.337 --> 10:42.280
And then there was a

10:42.260 --> 10:47.226
No, those names aren't uh-uh.

10:47.286 --> 10:48.167
Horace Byers.

10:48.467 --> 10:49.248
Horace Byers.

10:50.209 --> 10:51.671
Yeah, I knew of Horace Byers.

10:53.633 --> 10:57.538
What about this president named Earl Rudder?

10:57.618 --> 10:59.059
What did you think of him?

10:59.079 --> 11:07.009
Oh, I loved Earl Rudder, but those things were often in the ionosphere, the stratosphere for me.

11:07.129 --> 11:09.972
How often did you physically see him?

11:11.437 --> 11:14.803
maybe at graduation, about the only time I really saw him.

11:15.644 --> 11:20.552
He was over at the administration building, I think, and I don't know too much more about that.

11:20.592 --> 11:23.737
You know, who was Dick Winery?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.544
He's not in central administration until Calhoun.

11:27.564 --> 11:29.747
Until Calhoun, that's right.

11:29.767 --> 11:33.293
And that was my—John Calhoun was my closest

11:33.914 --> 11:37.784
contact with outside college administrators.

11:37.804 --> 11:42.837
All right now he becomes the vice president in 71.

11:43.218 --> 11:46.726
After President Rudder dies.

11:47.268 --> 11:51.298
Do you remember hear any reaction to Rudder's death?

11:51.278 --> 11:51.979
No.

11:52.820 --> 11:53.541
No, I don't know.

11:53.782 --> 11:54.703
I don't hear it.

11:54.723 --> 11:56.967
And then Williams becomes president.

11:56.987 --> 11:57.808
Yeah, Jack Williams.

11:58.910 --> 12:07.382
I never met him maybe over once or twice, and I don't know if he ever would recognize me personally, who I was.

12:07.522 --> 12:08.865
But I really liked that guy.

12:08.885 --> 12:12.730
That guy had a charisma to him that I felt.

12:13.371 --> 12:15.835
I should agree with you.

12:15.815 --> 12:26.789
That was the first year, I think, that we did a little promo for incoming students.

12:26.930 --> 12:37.063
We did a little slide presentation, and the guys over in architecture put it together, and Randy Walagura

12:37.415 --> 12:45.427
and John Grier and those guys put it together and they asked me to come over.

12:45.467 --> 12:52.138
Rodney Hill was doing some stuff and so they took a picture of me and had me say a few words.

12:52.178 --> 12:55.643
But I remember Jack Williams saying

12:56.669 --> 13:06.737
And he kind of said, if you don't like young folks, you really ought not to be at Texas A&M.

13:06.757 --> 13:12.012
And he said it in that deep Tennessee voice that he has and a slow voice.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.716
And I can remember that.

13:14.736 --> 13:16.479
That was a tough one.

13:16.499 --> 13:30.422
Now, it was he who insisted that the board authorize him to take an existing dormitory and designate it for women in January of 1971.

13:30.875 --> 13:32.999
And the enrollment then skyrocketed.

13:33.079 --> 13:36.886
Did you all begin to see the effects of the enrollment in the department?

13:36.906 --> 13:37.387
Oh, yeah.

13:37.788 --> 13:39.191
Well, we saw more and more women.

13:40.052 --> 13:46.825
And for somebody that came from a co-ed school,

13:47.362 --> 13:53.497
I don't want, you know, that was fine with me and they just grew and we've always had some very good students.

13:53.657 --> 14:03.902
And I've, you know, I have, there's a young lady out, Jane Richardson, her husband's very active over in the ag school and they live out at Ozona.

14:03.882 --> 14:20.045
And I, she came in last fall and gave me a great big hug and her two kids were, she got three kids and one's going to be a freshman here and she remembers me and so, you know, you get this kind of feedback that you have.

14:20.105 --> 14:28.476
Nancy Crouch, not Nancy Crouch, that wouldn't be right, but there were some of the other people here in town that I had as students.

14:29.438 --> 14:32.522
Now I call them my grand students are now here.

14:32.603 --> 14:42.174
Are there some things that, in hindsight, y'all did that either worked or didn't work in the late 60s, early 70s as a department?

14:42.194 --> 14:43.716
That didn't work, things that we did?

14:43.736 --> 14:44.517
Did or did not.

14:44.657 --> 14:53.948
Any... You said y'all did some slides about... No, well, that's the university did those slides.

14:53.968 --> 14:54.649
Yeah, yeah.

14:54.689 --> 14:57.052
Did y'all do anything... To promote the college?

14:57.332 --> 14:58.654
College or the department?

14:58.674 --> 15:00.916
No, I think the college just kind of grew like topsy.

15:00.936 --> 15:02.458
John may have had a plan, but...

15:02.759 --> 15:09.831
I think A&M was still a pretty hard sell in places, particularly for the B school.

15:10.292 --> 15:14.359
It may not have been for the sciences and other places, but it was a hard sell for the College of Business.

15:14.379 --> 15:16.342
And in the College of Business was morale high?

15:17.104 --> 15:18.266
Yeah, morale was high.

15:18.326 --> 15:18.586
Why?

15:20.189 --> 15:22.573
I think, one, we were getting paid well.

15:23.431 --> 15:24.473
We were getting paid well.

15:24.913 --> 15:42.340
And you should know probably is that I think the College of Business probably had as good a salary as some of those guys over in physics and chemistry just because supply-demand situation is very hard to attract the business school.

15:42.360 --> 15:50.873
And as far as you and your colleagues were aware, how were salaries and other benefits here then compared to other schools?

15:50.853 --> 15:52.776
I think we were above the mark.

15:52.896 --> 15:54.799
We were above average at Texas A&M.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.962
And that's why we were attracted.

15:57.002 --> 16:03.212
Because I would go to national conferences and the word was, gosh, you guys are sure throwing a lot of money around.

16:04.214 --> 16:08.440
And oftentimes that money still wouldn't get.

16:08.690 --> 16:13.375
You still couldn't get the attention of somebody from big league schools.

16:14.476 --> 16:17.719
Who were some key people that you all employed during that?

16:17.739 --> 16:24.766
Oh, well, Pete Rose came to the college, and Pete helped us quite a bit.

16:24.786 --> 16:26.127
And Don Frazier did a lot.

16:26.368 --> 16:27.309
And Jim McNeil did.

16:27.889 --> 16:30.512
Jim had, you know, his personality took a twist.

16:32.214 --> 16:33.735
His daughter died.

16:33.715 --> 16:39.141
And he had some trauma with that from a sudden death of a small dogger.

16:39.802 --> 16:43.947
But Jim was well known around in marketing circles, a good researcher.

16:45.949 --> 16:49.613
And, of course, Bob Strasser came, and Bob, a prolific writer.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.714
Where did y'all get Bob?

16:52.717 --> 16:54.819
Bob came out of Maryland.

16:55.300 --> 17:02.608
I think he came to us from Maryland, but he had taught at Penn State and over in the East.

17:02.943 --> 17:08.414
Bob never ran the department, but he and John hit it off real well.

17:08.454 --> 17:09.757
Who recruited him, do you know?

17:09.817 --> 17:12.021
I don't know who recruited him.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.163
I don't know who got him here.

17:13.184 --> 17:22.943
When you were part of a recruitment group, what did you all tell prospects about the department, the college, and the institution?

17:23.092 --> 17:26.617
Well, I think we sold the Aggie spirit.

17:27.358 --> 17:31.484
We sold that it was a great community to live in.

17:31.985 --> 17:35.610
There was a lot of opportunity down here in terms of salary and growth.

17:36.291 --> 17:48.168
We talked that the legislature had a lot in the future plans for the state of Texas, resided on the shoulders of Texas A&M.

17:48.669 --> 17:51.293
We'd bring them down here, walk them around, show them the community.

17:52.184 --> 18:11.928
And if you wanted a rural setting, and if you wanted a good place to raise your family, that we were equally inaccessible to all the major cities in Texas, but it was an academic environment.

18:12.328 --> 18:13.430
We weren't a party school.

18:14.070 --> 18:15.071
We were very serious.

18:16.233 --> 18:19.677
We weren't like the schools over at San Marcos or at Austin.

18:19.657 --> 18:20.999
or at Huntsville.

18:21.559 --> 18:29.549
I think our kids here are as serious kids as you'll find, and we can work them hard.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.073
Describe the air service in those years.

18:33.454 --> 18:36.537
Oh, the air service, Davis Airlines.

18:37.098 --> 18:41.663
Well, prior to that it was TTA, Treetop Airlines.

18:44.227 --> 18:45.628
But describe Davis Airlines.

18:45.648 --> 18:48.752
Well, Davis Airlines, Guy Davis,

18:49.357 --> 18:52.402
ran a little two-prop, maybe had a couple planes.

18:53.284 --> 18:57.311
And he'd fly between Dallas and College Station.

18:57.411 --> 19:03.061
And I can remember a lot of my Sea Grant stuff, I'd be the only guy on the plane.

19:03.081 --> 19:12.597
Since I was the only guy on the plane, why, a guy would let me sit up and run shotgun with him, and we would fly back to

19:12.577 --> 19:14.222
College Station and visit.

19:14.302 --> 19:17.310
And I was a pretty regular customer to him.

19:17.371 --> 19:25.253
And I remember one time we were coming in and the voiceover says, why don't you make one sweep down there

19:25.368 --> 19:30.535
And he says, well there's some deer on the runway and you need to just kind of get down there and shoo them off.

19:30.575 --> 19:32.457
And you circle back and you come in.

19:32.497 --> 19:33.658
And so sure enough we did.

19:33.678 --> 19:37.423
And sometimes he couldn't fly.

19:37.483 --> 19:45.233
So I would get the guy who was up here, Eddie

19:45.213 --> 19:47.536
would drive for you, had a cab service.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.322
La Rosa or Lopez.

19:52.342 --> 19:54.324
It was an Italian family name.

19:54.344 --> 19:55.666
Family Italian name.

19:55.746 --> 19:58.770
And he's driven to Dallas to get me.

20:00.572 --> 20:01.654
Particularly to Houston.

20:01.694 --> 20:03.316
To Houston, drive you to Houston.

20:03.436 --> 20:09.904
And he had an old Buick and he had 280,000 maybe 300,000, not a Buick, a Mercury.

20:09.884 --> 20:13.228
He had a Mercury, and he kept that thing in tip-top shape.

20:13.248 --> 20:21.717
In fact, he put an engine in my little Chevy II station wagon that I had at 63, so I could get another 100,000 miles out of that car.

20:21.737 --> 20:28.625
Did you ever fly with Wolfgang, who was a guy who employed a pilot briefly who had been a former Luftwaffe pilot?

20:28.645 --> 20:29.266
Well, that, no.

20:29.866 --> 20:31.528
Wolfgang, no.

20:31.829 --> 20:33.370
No, I never had him.

20:33.390 --> 20:33.951
All right.

20:34.960 --> 20:45.194
Did, do you remember any experiences with a prospective faculty member who were turned off by this being too small a town or too?

20:45.214 --> 20:47.838
No, no, we, there were probably a lot of people.

20:48.699 --> 20:55.028
We, we, in fact, we, I think we have more difficult time recruiting now than we did then.

20:55.902 --> 21:14.945
We have more time, just because we're going after, we're going at the major schools, we're going to the Northwesterns, and we're going to Penn States and the Michigans and the Illinois, and so a lot of people, you know, just don't want to live in this rural environment.

21:15.406 --> 21:18.510
Particularly spouses, you see, who are working spouses.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.133
There just aren't the same job opportunities.

21:21.417 --> 21:26.303
you're inferring that our sites are a little higher now.

21:26.723 --> 21:38.236
Our sites are higher, plus in those days, wives came and they weren't, they were wives that were wives of the 50s and early 60s, and they weren't.

21:39.638 --> 21:43.122
For example, describe your wife becoming a part of the community.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.044
Well, my wife jumped in right away.

21:46.786 --> 21:53.933
She's very gregarious, and so we became part of the Newcomers Club, or Welcome Wagon Club, or whatever it was.

21:54.373 --> 22:04.523
She got involved with the Texas A&M women's social group, and next thing you know, within a couple years, she had finagled it.

22:05.444 --> 22:08.907
We had a network of probably eight or ten people.

22:08.887 --> 22:14.976
And over the years, that's winnowed down to three or four people that we regularly go with.

22:15.096 --> 22:27.654
But she had ample opportunity to get around and meet people and found a little church to go to, UCC Church, United Church of Christ Church here.

22:27.755 --> 22:34.945
And we wanted to stay with a small church and went with that and met some nice people over there.

22:35.448 --> 22:36.651
What about the schools?

22:36.851 --> 22:37.954
All the schools were great.

22:38.555 --> 22:39.798
Absolutely great.

22:40.439 --> 22:44.769
When we came here, Carter Creek was not completed north and south.

22:45.311 --> 22:53.710
In fact, it stopped right at Tanglewood Park, so our kids would have to walk through the path to get up to Sul Ross.

22:53.690 --> 22:59.378
And we were really pleased with the education our kids got.

22:59.398 --> 23:01.781
They went from Saul Ross and then went up.

23:02.462 --> 23:05.506
When we got here, I don't think the schools were integrated yet.

23:06.287 --> 23:12.436
Kemp was still black, and it might have been within a year or two they integrated and they began to bust.

23:13.157 --> 23:22.870
But all three of our kids, we had Abby here in 66, and all three of our kids went through the Bryan school systems, all got a great education.

23:23.373 --> 23:26.540
And all succeeded very well here at Texas A&M.

23:26.981 --> 23:32.172
And I'm really pleased with the quality of the teaching and the quality of the schools.

23:32.192 --> 23:43.035
Now our kids were in, I guess, what they might call the honors or advanced programs, but we were really tickled with the quality of the work that we got here.

23:43.015 --> 23:53.753
staying with the schools were you aware of any problems of any importance over integration in the Bryan School?

23:54.274 --> 24:06.795
No and I tell you what happened to us we were fortunate I and I don't know how I did it why I did it was just one of those things you want to get kids involved in activities I got our kids involved with the Boys Club

24:08.480 --> 24:11.884
And I guess it was starting with the football.

24:12.104 --> 24:15.848
And the first team they had were the Jets.

24:16.369 --> 24:20.754
And there was a guy by the name of Phil Graham, who was the coach of the Jets.

24:20.774 --> 24:25.499
And so Phil is extremely competitive.

24:25.519 --> 24:31.406
He and Chuck Maurice were the two coaches, young Shavetail assistant professors of economics here at Texas A&M.

24:31.827 --> 24:32.968
So this one might have been

24:33.286 --> 24:56.830
the fall 69 or 68 or 69 and and so our kids got involved and that was sponsored by the boys club later we got into the wrestling and i we would spend three nights a week wrestling practice and then well on the weekends we'd take off and take this old blue bomb bus all over uh texas from houston to dallas to east texas wrestling other boys clubs

24:57.535 --> 25:08.092
Well, it's a lot of salt and pepper and a lot more pepper than salt in that arrangement.

25:08.232 --> 25:15.764
And our kids got to know the other black kids their age because we had about 40 out for wrestling.

25:16.726 --> 25:23.577
And we'd take a busload of 35 on that bus and our two boys and maybe two other boys would be the only white boys.

25:24.907 --> 25:33.057
And so when it came to going to Bryan High School and going to Stephen F. Austin High School, our kids knew all the black kids.

25:33.117 --> 25:39.725
And they were all friends with the athletes and the kids there.

25:39.745 --> 25:50.158
And so we never saw that side of it because we were accepted on both sides, accepted by the white group and accepted by the black group.

25:50.178 --> 25:52.180
And so we were fortunate.

25:52.160 --> 25:58.690
Were you aware of any particular racial problems at Bryan High during those years?

25:59.051 --> 25:59.835
No, not at that time.

26:00.277 --> 26:01.663
Not at that time, we weren't.

26:01.711 --> 26:14.523
Do you have any comparison you could make about racial relations in the Bryan public schools when your children were there compared to racial relations in the public schools in Illinois when you were a student?

26:14.943 --> 26:15.483
Well, yeah.

26:17.385 --> 26:19.287
When I was a student, of course, there weren't any blacks.

26:19.367 --> 26:21.909
That's in the 50s, or if they were, they were nominal.

26:23.350 --> 26:31.718
The year when I was deaning, and this was in the 60s and 63 and 64, there were

26:31.698 --> 26:37.742
There was an effort on the part of the Big Ten schools to get more blacks into the Big Ten schools.

26:39.443 --> 26:52.682
And it became quite competitive, and as you might suspect, the more prestigious schools and private schools had already taken the cream of the crop off the top of the black kids.

26:53.082 --> 26:55.927
Those could write their ticket and go anywhere.

26:56.007 --> 27:00.273
So what you were left were degrees of inferiority.

27:01.815 --> 27:03.257
And we were latecomers.

27:04.300 --> 27:05.742
University of Illinois was a late comer.

27:06.624 --> 27:10.209
But there was this mandate, we've got to get some numbers up.

27:10.810 --> 27:21.347
And I can recall that we admitted at the university into the College of Commerce students with ACT scores of 11.

27:23.335 --> 27:24.497
out of Philadelphia.

27:25.639 --> 27:39.060
Now the typical, maybe as high as 19, but the typical Illinois kid had an average ACT composite score of close to 30.

27:39.581 --> 27:43.487
And that's a very good, probably it's closer to 32 maybe.

27:43.467 --> 27:54.621
So here was a kid that was in the top 6 or 7 percent quartile or 10 percent quartile of the ACT scores and along comes a kid with an ACT 11.

27:54.701 --> 28:01.310
And we at Illinois told the kids they were going to have dormitories and we told them what to and we didn't deliver.

28:01.590 --> 28:09.120
We didn't give them the dormitory quality said we were going to and the next thing you know these kids were walking up and down parading up and down Wright Street.

28:09.100 --> 28:15.411
and breaking in windows of the businesses there, and they had a problem.

28:16.152 --> 28:25.108
Just because they didn't go at it methodically and systematically and over due time, rather they had to fill it rapidly.

28:25.588 --> 28:27.131
Of course we didn't have that problem here.

28:27.732 --> 28:32.340
Do you remember any of your first black students in classes here?

28:32.928 --> 28:34.289
No, I didn't.

28:34.349 --> 28:35.010
No, I didn't.

28:35.030 --> 28:35.671
I don't remember.

28:35.691 --> 28:41.297
I just remember our first black student on the football team, McElroy.

28:41.397 --> 28:42.598
Leland McElroy, I think.

28:42.678 --> 28:43.719
And it was Hugh.

28:43.739 --> 28:44.440
Hugh McElroy.

28:45.841 --> 28:47.003
He wasn't in one of your classes, was he?

28:47.023 --> 28:48.704
No, no.

28:49.205 --> 28:56.893
College of Business doesn't have a reputation of attracting very many athletes.

28:57.565 --> 29:04.513
You mentioned earlier that when you first got here, sometimes the one or two girls would get hissed out.

29:04.553 --> 29:14.984
As the enrollment begins to boom with women and we get more minority students, do you remember any incidents, anything?

29:15.124 --> 29:15.845
No, I don't think.

29:16.045 --> 29:26.577
I remember something you told me, was that if you looked at a graph of the number of married students at A&M,

29:27.856 --> 29:46.532
before the COAD, and you looked at the ratio of number of married students afterwards, there was a declining curve because they were bringing their sex with them through the marriage vows, and now they didn't have to go to runoff all the way to Baylor and bird dog the girls at Baylor at Sam.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.678
The girls were already here.

29:49.658 --> 29:51.620
I think it was pretty well accepted.

29:51.660 --> 29:59.729
I think you probably had more difficulty, and I'm not aware of all of it, but you're probably more so than I am of the difficulty of putting the women in the band and the women in the court.

30:01.752 --> 30:09.240
Like, I never heard of any problems that a black student had here, really.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.582
No, no.

30:11.283 --> 30:15.227
Yes, there may have been one individual

30:15.865 --> 30:18.232
white, one individual, black, in the hallway.

30:18.373 --> 30:20.439
Something may have been said or not said.

30:21.202 --> 30:28.204
But again, quite often that is in the eyes or the ears of the observer.

30:28.302 --> 30:31.307
more than it is of the intent of the person.

30:31.327 --> 30:36.235
You probably had just as many with the Orientals as you probably did with the back.

30:36.255 --> 30:38.178
Or the tall, or the short, or the fat.

30:42.084 --> 30:51.279
With Dr. Williams and John Calhoun and so forth, did you all begin, did you think that we were in a higher gear in the 70s?

30:51.299 --> 30:51.459
Yeah.

30:53.783 --> 30:55.305
Jack Williams, I think,

30:55.285 --> 30:59.133
pushed the growth.

31:00.435 --> 31:08.832
He must have done a very mesmerizing job over at Austin because those days were good days from a revenue point of view.

31:09.093 --> 31:11.357
When did you all start a graduate program, do you know?

31:11.698 --> 31:13.682
Well, we had a graduate program.
