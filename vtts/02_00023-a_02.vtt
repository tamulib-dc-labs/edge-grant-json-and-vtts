WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:12.828
Junior, we signed our contract for the Army being commissioned when we graduated, and that was also $50 a month.

00:13.669 --> 00:21.861
Between that and a little bit of allowance and a few other things, I had $150 or $200 a month to spend.

00:22.201 --> 00:26.047
Of course, you've got gasoline, and you have a date every now and then.

00:26.067 --> 00:29.211
You could go through that money in football season.

00:29.933 --> 00:33.036
45 bucks or so, if you had a date of it, you had a pretty good weekend.

00:33.557 --> 00:35.879
Do you remember, in general, what it cost?

00:35.939 --> 00:39.543
What was the total bill of going to A&M?

00:40.764 --> 00:41.245
No.

00:41.405 --> 00:42.546
A year or a semester?

00:42.987 --> 00:46.050
Oh, the cost of going to school?

00:46.691 --> 00:53.878
I remember the first semester was five, six hundred dollars.

00:54.819 --> 00:56.481
That was room, board, tuition.

00:56.967 --> 01:00.692
and probably another 40 or 50 for books.

01:02.073 --> 01:04.917
For some reason, a second semester was a little bit less.

01:06.418 --> 01:09.883
Early 500s, high fours, something like that.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.686
Relatively, it was probably equal to what it is now.

01:12.886 --> 01:16.671
Maybe not, but that was a lot of money to me.

01:17.332 --> 01:22.218
Did you have other jobs before the Aggieland on the campus?

01:23.039 --> 01:25.101
No, sir.

01:25.385 --> 01:32.553
Other job that I did have, though I was a junior and I worked for a professor grading papers.

01:32.953 --> 01:39.820
And that paid, it would depend on the time I put in, but he was fair with me.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.523
What about in the summer, did you have any special jobs?

01:42.543 --> 01:53.535
Well I came home in the summer and I went to work, the first summer I went to work for Sun Oil Company down in Winnie, Texas, just south of Beaumont, between Beaumont and the coast.

01:53.903 --> 01:55.245
And that was a great job.

01:55.285 --> 02:03.073
They had a program where they hired sons of employees.

02:03.394 --> 02:04.915
A few boys were in college.

02:05.676 --> 02:10.402
My dad didn't work for them, but I had cut the grass of one of the vice presidents or son.

02:10.622 --> 02:15.648
And he told me, he said, if you want a job next time, I'll get you a good job in the oil field.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.308
I said, I sure would.

02:16.328 --> 02:22.155
So I reached him in the spring of our fish year, and I went to work for $2.83 an hour.

02:22.591 --> 02:23.452
Which was good money.

02:24.314 --> 02:26.938
Good money, and this was the summer of 68.

02:27.258 --> 02:29.662
That was a great job.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.124
Went back to A&M in the fall.

02:32.326 --> 02:45.567
The next year, for some reason, I don't remember why that job wasn't available, but I went to work for a company called Great Lakes Carbon down in Port Arthur.

02:45.587 --> 02:48.351
We actually shoveled carbon and coke out of railroad cars.

02:48.411 --> 02:49.493
Really nasty job.

02:50.570 --> 02:54.855
The following year we went to summer camp at Fort Sill, so anyway.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.896
But they were good jobs.

02:55.936 --> 02:57.818
I was always lucky I worked with good people.

02:58.960 --> 03:03.165
What role did the MSC play in campus life as you knew it?

03:03.185 --> 03:09.732
Well the MSC was the meeting place or the campus living room or whatever we called it in those days.

03:10.834 --> 03:14.518
The MSC as it is now, that's where your P.O.

03:14.538 --> 03:15.379
box was.

03:16.692 --> 03:18.374
It wasn't unusual to go check your P.O.

03:18.414 --> 03:23.302
box two or three times a day and find that there was still nothing in there.

03:23.322 --> 03:26.907
But that was the meeting place, everybody meeting in the coffee shop at the MSC.

03:26.927 --> 03:32.956
Do you remember anybody not respecting the hats off policy?

03:33.256 --> 03:33.677
No.

03:33.857 --> 03:35.099
I don't either.

03:35.119 --> 03:42.970
I saw a youngster yesterday who was obviously a campus visitor, looked like he might be a junior in high school, and he walked in and

03:43.270 --> 03:49.758
and there was a little girl with him and she kind of elbowed me and he took his cap off as quick as could be.

03:49.939 --> 03:52.943
Yeah, I've never seen that.

03:53.083 --> 04:03.256
Do you remember any important event where you had a date or family or something, anything that happened in the MSC that was special for you during your four years?

04:03.276 --> 04:07.101
Yeah, yes sir.

04:08.127 --> 04:13.434
Our Aggieland or our student publications banquet up there each year.

04:14.375 --> 04:19.222
And student publications encompass the Aggieland, the Battalion.

04:21.325 --> 04:21.685
What else?

04:22.326 --> 04:24.929
I guess that was it, the Battalion and the Aggieland in those days.

04:25.791 --> 04:29.716
And my girlfriend, who's now my wife, was up for that.

04:31.058 --> 04:33.341
And I was the editor, so I was at the head table.

04:34.022 --> 04:38.067
And I had to get up and talk and introduce my people and give a short talk.

04:38.603 --> 04:40.226
I was never very good at that.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.934
I had never done much of it, so I rehearsed the heck out of that.

04:43.954 --> 04:46.981
And, of course, the food was wonderful, just like it is now.

04:47.021 --> 04:52.512
You go to the president's dinner before a ball game, and anything in the world, it's first class.

04:53.174 --> 04:53.975
And it was.

04:54.116 --> 04:55.258
Very, very nice.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.102
It was a nice event.

04:58.280 --> 05:03.385
Let's see, YMCA, did that play any part in you?

05:03.405 --> 05:03.865
No, not really.

05:03.885 --> 05:05.787
I went over there to borrow some money every now and then.

05:06.127 --> 05:08.049
You know, they had the student loan thing.

05:08.089 --> 05:14.735
I told you a while ago I didn't have any financial problems, and I really didn't, but every now and then you need $20 towards the end of the month.

05:14.755 --> 05:16.417
And go over there and get $20.

05:18.138 --> 05:18.538
What was it?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.100
Was there an interest rate?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.621
Yeah, but it was almost nothing.

05:23.783 --> 05:25.705
Did you ever borrow any money from Old Army Lou?

05:25.955 --> 05:27.077
No, sir, never did.

05:27.097 --> 05:28.198
Did any of your friends?

05:28.519 --> 05:29.500
Not that I know of.

05:30.302 --> 05:30.943
Did that happen?

05:31.303 --> 05:31.804
Oh, yes.

05:31.904 --> 05:32.125
Oh, did it?

05:32.145 --> 05:33.286
Oh, yes, yes.

05:33.386 --> 05:34.148
No, I didn't know.

05:34.168 --> 05:39.456
And he, until his dying day, he said I never lost him, that almost every student paid me back.

05:39.616 --> 05:40.377
I bet that's true.

05:41.279 --> 05:42.120
Guyon Hall.

05:43.923 --> 05:52.696
What we saw, I've never been licked at Guyon Hall, and honestly, I don't remember what year it was.

05:52.776 --> 05:53.818
I think we were fish.

05:55.132 --> 05:57.996
But Guyon Hall was torn down our senior year.

06:01.400 --> 06:05.525
I remember going in there to see, never been licked, you hear all about this.

06:05.645 --> 06:08.369
Did that movie make any impression on you?

06:08.949 --> 06:11.913
I guess it did.

06:11.933 --> 06:14.296
I thought it was kind of corny.

06:14.316 --> 06:17.460
But there were some big name stars in that thing.

06:18.925 --> 06:23.430
Let's see, do you remember any important campus visitors during your four years?

06:24.031 --> 06:25.533
Any dignitaries that came?

06:26.254 --> 06:34.423
Well, the ones I remember that really impressed me were at General Rudder's funeral.

06:34.443 --> 06:37.387
Lyndon Johnson was there.

06:37.407 --> 06:38.788
John Conley was there.

06:42.473 --> 06:48.780
I don't remember who else, but those were two men I'd always had a lot of respect for.

06:49.081 --> 07:07.951
And, of course, just being a student on campus, you don't know how, I don't want to say this, the president of the university, you don't realize he's involved in legislative affairs and he's involved in politics and all these things, all these people that he knows.

07:07.971 --> 07:10.836
You learn that as you get along.

07:11.103 --> 07:15.209
You went to that ceremony?

07:15.450 --> 07:17.453
Did the ceremony itself make an impression on you?

07:17.473 --> 07:21.078
Well it was in G. Raleigh, it was very impressive.

07:21.098 --> 07:25.245
I was not an RV, of course the RVs were involved in it.

07:25.265 --> 07:28.009
Yeah, it was something.

07:28.369 --> 07:30.052
I certainly went to that.

07:31.474 --> 07:35.821
Religious activities, did you participate in any religious?

07:36.001 --> 07:39.186
Did you attend church or chapel or anything?

07:39.588 --> 07:42.632
It kind of ran in spurts like everything else.

07:42.712 --> 07:48.100
A couple of us would go to church there in Bryan or College Station, and we'd go to a few different places every now and then.

07:48.720 --> 07:55.009
I hate to say it, unfortunately, it wasn't a big part of my campus life.

07:56.150 --> 07:57.152
Let's see, G. Raleigh.

07:58.013 --> 08:01.458
Describe sporting events in G. Raleigh.

08:01.478 --> 08:08.447
Well, of course, we had the basketball games, and as a guy in the Corps, being a freshman or a...

08:08.680 --> 08:13.848
sophomore, you could get out of CQ if you had a pass to go to the ball game.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.352
That's probably why our grades weren't very good.

08:16.372 --> 08:24.905
So we went to the basketball games and the things that, we had a lot of town halls in there.

08:25.306 --> 08:28.591
They brought in some pretty big group names in those days.

08:28.611 --> 08:32.477
Kenny Rogers, it was Kenny Rogers in the first edition.

08:33.048 --> 08:46.566
I can't remember the names of the other groups there, but they were the popular groups around the country for the day, and they were normally on a Friday night before a football game, so your date would come up, and that was a big deal.

08:47.468 --> 08:59.644
You'd get all dressed up for that thing, and you know, go in your uniform, and we thought we were, by the time you got juniors, you'd go to that, you thought you were stood on campus.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.548
Did a good job.

09:02.933 --> 09:06.597
Describe a basketball game atmosphere.

09:06.918 --> 09:09.301
Well, it depended on it.

09:09.321 --> 09:10.542
The band was always there.

09:10.562 --> 09:12.825
Of course, G. Raleigh's not that big a place, you know.

09:13.526 --> 09:15.768
And, you know, the Yale leaders were there.

09:16.189 --> 09:16.830
Was it noisy?

09:17.130 --> 09:18.231
It was noisy as it could be.

09:19.353 --> 09:19.953
Very noisy.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.155
That's the fun part about it.

09:22.016 --> 09:23.878
And were we winning then?

09:25.512 --> 09:29.097
You know, I hate to tell you, I don't really remember if we were winning or not.

09:30.219 --> 09:30.820
I see.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.023
Shelby was coached in yesterday.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.567
I think we were doing okay.

09:36.528 --> 09:37.750
It's now 25 after.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.052
Should we quit?

09:40.154 --> 09:42.938
We can go a few more minutes.

09:43.619 --> 09:44.981
I've got my son working for us.

09:45.001 --> 09:45.922
He started today.

09:45.962 --> 09:47.284
He just finished his...

09:48.057 --> 09:53.905
his first six weeks at A&M summer school when he's home for the rest of summer.

09:53.925 --> 09:55.828
I'll have you meet him here in a minute.

09:55.848 --> 09:57.310
He's going to go to lunch with you.

09:57.550 --> 09:57.971
Let's see.

10:02.357 --> 10:12.131
In terms of G. Raleigh, you went there for basketball games, for some concerts, commissioning.

10:13.293 --> 10:14.855
Commissioning was there in graduation.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.018
Describe commissioning as you recall it, for you.

10:17.470 --> 10:22.857
Well, I guess we were lighthearted in those days.

10:22.937 --> 10:24.959
It might be a little more solemn event today.

10:26.141 --> 10:30.166
I'm trying to remember who our speaker was.

10:30.186 --> 10:31.988
Was it Westmoreland?

10:32.008 --> 10:33.410
I'm asking.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.211
I don't know.

10:34.231 --> 10:37.515
I don't remember for sure.

10:37.535 --> 10:46.667
But it was a time we were looking forward to and hoping we weren't sent to Vietnam because that was a big issue in those days.

10:47.187 --> 10:54.336
Our class, I'm escaping your question, our class barely dodged that Vietnam bullet.

10:54.356 --> 11:00.624
We had a few people go, but not near the people from the class of, say, 66 through 70.

11:02.026 --> 11:04.649
They got hit real hard over there.

11:04.669 --> 11:16.063
But I do remember coming out, my mother pinned my bars on them, and you come out in your fisher there, you know, the first one that

11:16.381 --> 11:18.904
That salutes you gets a buck.

11:18.924 --> 11:19.405
Oh really?

11:19.425 --> 11:21.667
So I got a dollar.

11:21.687 --> 11:24.511
And I had kind of, I think I probably cheated.

11:24.571 --> 11:26.033
I had kind of a favored fish.

11:26.053 --> 11:30.178
He wasn't real sharp, but anyway he got the dollar.

11:30.278 --> 11:30.899
Commencement?

11:31.199 --> 11:33.101
Commencement was a big deal.

11:36.345 --> 11:41.371
It was in G. Raleigh just like it was up until the last one in December.

11:41.431 --> 11:43.654
My son graduated on that last one in December.

11:44.275 --> 11:45.737
I remember it just like that.

11:47.239 --> 11:47.980
It was kind of long.

11:51.384 --> 11:52.025
Who attended?

11:52.205 --> 11:53.367
How many students went?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.129
What percentage of the students?

11:55.890 --> 11:59.014
I don't know anybody that did not go to commencement.

12:00.676 --> 12:06.023
I understand now that still it's that way.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.886
Very few do not go to commencement.

12:08.906 --> 12:10.849
In many colleges, they mail you a diploma.

12:11.129 --> 12:11.570
That's it.

12:12.631 --> 12:14.113
But everybody went.

12:14.397 --> 12:22.746
As far as I know, A&M is one-of-a-kind outside the service academies, where everybody goes.

12:22.786 --> 12:25.128
And everybody's well-behaved?

12:26.049 --> 12:28.772
Was the speaker anybody significant, or do you remember?

12:28.912 --> 12:29.914
I really don't remember.

12:30.014 --> 12:31.755
I'm embarrassed to tell you, I really do not remember.

12:31.775 --> 12:33.597
Well, but nobody goes to your commencement speakers.

12:33.998 --> 12:35.740
I've been on that side of the fence.

12:35.760 --> 12:36.681
Yeah, I don't remember.

12:37.241 --> 12:40.725
I do remember the association president,

12:41.853 --> 12:51.630
Had I not been looking at some stuff, the reason I wouldn't remember, but when we graduated, Mr. Appelt, Les Appelt, in Houston, was the president of the association.

12:51.650 --> 12:55.998
And I remember, all I know is he was there and he gave a talk and couldn't tell you what they could say.

12:56.018 --> 13:03.912
Which student organizations had the highest credibility, they were most...

13:06.035 --> 13:06.676
Profile?

13:06.996 --> 13:08.177
You mean?

13:08.197 --> 13:11.780
That y'all respected most, admired most.

13:13.081 --> 13:13.602
Well, I don't know.

13:13.622 --> 13:16.965
I guess you'd call the Corps a student organization.

13:16.985 --> 13:22.570
Well, other than the Corps.

13:22.590 --> 13:26.594
Sindhats, band, student government, Yale leaders.

13:29.436 --> 13:31.859
I would have to say probably the student government.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.460
The student leaders were...

13:33.777 --> 13:36.460
Who were those leaders when you were?

13:36.480 --> 13:46.212
Well, when I was a freshman, the president of the student body was a guy named Geistwhite, Jerry Geistwhite.

13:46.232 --> 13:49.456
Big, impressive fellow.

13:49.476 --> 13:54.542
Senior, you know, all decked out in all his boots and everything.

13:54.562 --> 13:57.586
He's actually a lawyer up in the Hill Country somewhere, I'm not sure where.

13:59.047 --> 14:03.733
He's just a guy, he got up and talked and said, I like that guy, I'd like to be like that guy.

14:04.439 --> 14:18.917
A couple of the guys that I knew were, well, one fellow, in fact his name's on that list, he was our vice president of our fish class.

14:18.937 --> 14:26.287
When we were seniors, I'm bouncing around here, Kent Caperton was president of the student body.

14:26.307 --> 14:31.273
He's gone on to be a pretty well-known, pretty active politician, I think he was a senator or

14:31.591 --> 14:32.852
I know Kent very well.

14:33.232 --> 14:35.374
I know Kent very, very well.

14:35.394 --> 14:35.875
Nice fellow.

14:35.895 --> 14:37.256
Did you all hold him in high regard?

14:37.456 --> 14:37.737
I did.

14:37.757 --> 14:38.938
I think we did.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.779
Now he was not in the Corps.

14:40.799 --> 14:41.740
That's right.

14:41.900 --> 14:47.966
But Kent was just the kind of guy who could talk to folks and everybody liked him.

14:48.647 --> 14:53.911
Were there any women who had been female who had important leadership roles yet?

14:53.991 --> 14:54.792
Not that I remember.

14:55.993 --> 14:58.816
There were not that many women on campus.

14:58.836 --> 15:00.197
They were pretty much dependents.

15:01.763 --> 15:11.093
We became, fall of 70 we were seniors and that year I do remember we had more women attending A&M.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.096
But it wasn't anything like it is now.

15:14.116 --> 15:26.769
If you could have had any student elected or appointed role on the campus other than being editor of the Aggieland, in terms of the prestige it carried, what would it have been?

15:27.610 --> 15:28.891
Oh, I don't know.

15:28.911 --> 15:29.492
I don't know.

15:31.328 --> 15:39.317
What student body president the most, did that outrank corps commander you think in general?

15:39.577 --> 15:40.418
Not in our minds.

15:40.619 --> 15:41.079
Oh, okay.

15:41.119 --> 15:42.100
Not if you were in the corps.

15:42.361 --> 15:42.741
Okay.

15:42.781 --> 15:43.622
Not if you were in the corps.

15:43.662 --> 15:51.071
All right, after that, being a yell leader, band commander, was there any kind of... Well, we always made fun of the band.

15:51.091 --> 15:54.034
I mean, you know, nobody could make fun of them but us.

15:54.054 --> 16:00.221
And, you know, we always made fun of the band, but we had some impressive corps commanders.

16:00.241 --> 16:01.082
Who were they?

16:01.788 --> 16:05.173
When I was a freshman, it was a guy named Lonnie Menz.

16:05.594 --> 16:06.936
M-I-N-Z?

16:07.397 --> 16:08.479
I believe that's right.

16:08.499 --> 16:08.879
Okay.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.804
When we were sophomores, Hector Gutierrez.

16:12.545 --> 16:14.408
I know Hector today.

16:14.588 --> 16:15.550
Good guy.

16:15.610 --> 16:16.371
I know Hector well.

16:16.772 --> 16:18.414
When we were juniors, we had a renegade.

16:18.434 --> 16:20.117
We had a guy named Matt Carroll.

16:20.249 --> 16:25.457
Matt went off and did some crazy things after he got out of school.

16:25.477 --> 16:27.159
We were seniors, a guy named Van Taylor.

16:27.760 --> 16:28.621
Van was from Temple.

16:28.982 --> 16:30.725
I know Van well.

16:30.765 --> 16:35.131
One of my roommates, a guy named Lee McFadden, was from Temple, and he was friends with Van.

16:35.492 --> 16:37.114
I got to know Van pretty well.

16:37.515 --> 16:38.817
Good guy, really good guy.

16:38.837 --> 16:39.317
Do you know him?

16:39.598 --> 16:39.898
Oh, yeah.

16:39.938 --> 16:41.300
See, I'm on the Southwestern Belt Board.

16:41.320 --> 16:41.781
Oh, are you?

16:41.921 --> 16:44.645
And he's in charge of Kansas and Missouri Forest.

16:44.665 --> 16:44.946
Right, yeah.

16:45.386 --> 16:46.408
Good guy.

16:46.428 --> 16:47.910
All right, Hector was the first...

16:48.228 --> 16:50.050
non-Anglo corps commander.

16:50.230 --> 16:51.712
Was he?

16:53.594 --> 16:55.696
Why do you think he was selected as corps commander?

16:55.816 --> 16:56.456
He was sharp.

16:57.798 --> 17:01.582
You know, looking back, I don't know if there were politics in that selection or not.

17:01.622 --> 17:02.383
I really don't know.

17:02.463 --> 17:05.586
I'm too naive at the time to think about it.

17:05.686 --> 17:09.049
Hector, very sharp, very sharp man.

17:09.330 --> 17:10.731
I don't think there was politics.

17:10.871 --> 17:14.455
I think he was selected solely on ability.

17:14.941 --> 17:19.687
I don't think that there was any kind of tokenism at all.

17:19.827 --> 17:21.709
I wouldn't think so.

17:21.729 --> 17:22.150
Let's see.

17:24.292 --> 17:25.934
We can roll on over there.

17:25.954 --> 17:26.154
All right.

17:26.174 --> 17:26.435
Let me see.

17:32.822 --> 17:38.950
How did you go home, go back and forth from home while you were a student?

17:39.751 --> 17:44.256
When I first got there, I didn't have a car, and I was able to get some

17:45.637 --> 17:48.079
ride homes with buddies.

17:48.099 --> 17:52.744
I did hitchhike once, got home as quick as had I driven.

17:52.764 --> 17:54.266
What was the routine for hitchhiking?

17:54.786 --> 18:00.952
Go out by the golf course with your Aggie bag and within a couple minutes you had a ride.

18:00.972 --> 18:02.974
It was pretty simple, pretty easy to do.

18:03.595 --> 18:09.881
Did you or anybody else you knew of ever have any unfortunate experience in hitchhiking?

18:10.122 --> 18:11.363
No sir.

18:11.443 --> 18:12.644
I haven't heard of any either.

18:12.664 --> 18:13.585
I don't know of anybody that ever did.

18:14.138 --> 18:17.681
All right, now you didn't get a ride straight to Port Natchez.

18:17.701 --> 18:22.805
No, what we did was, the one and only time I did it, we got a ride straight to Houston.

18:24.327 --> 18:26.869
So the boy let us out on the freeway somewhere in Houston.

18:27.790 --> 18:34.696
In a couple minutes we got another ride to Beaumont, within three blocks of my uncle's house, and we walked there and got his car.

18:34.716 --> 18:35.396
Good gracious.

18:35.416 --> 18:35.797
That's what we did.

18:36.637 --> 18:41.722
Let's see, now did you, as an Aggie, did you put your thumb up?

18:41.742 --> 18:42.062
Yes, sir.

18:42.102 --> 18:43.183
You did put, okay, so.

18:43.923 --> 18:44.685
Was there another way?

18:45.306 --> 18:49.134
No, I didn't know whether just standing there was enough.

18:49.154 --> 18:51.198
Having all done it once, I don't remember exactly the drill.

18:51.218 --> 18:57.090
We were in uniform and had our Aggie bags, and we were very lucky.

18:57.150 --> 19:04.665
Surely you've heard the story that some people have wondered, why do Aggies make a hitchhiker sign at a football game?

19:05.506 --> 19:06.767
Let's see.

19:08.669 --> 19:14.576
When you were a freshman without a car, how did you get around then in Brazos County?

19:15.136 --> 19:22.104
We had a couple of fish there in the outfit that had cars and we pretty much teamed up and go where we needed to go.

19:23.726 --> 19:27.089
The main thing you needed a car for in those days was just getting your dry clean.

19:28.451 --> 19:29.612
That was kind of a big deal.

19:30.453 --> 19:33.496
Then at Thanksgiving I brought back my dad's old work truck.

19:33.516 --> 19:35.158
I had a 53 Chevrolet.

19:35.628 --> 19:37.250
half-ton pickup that I drove.

19:37.270 --> 19:39.291
In fact, I drove it for the rest of the year.

19:40.152 --> 19:42.995
I got a car that I saw.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.277
Not many co-eds when you got there.

19:45.497 --> 19:46.098
Very few.

19:46.118 --> 19:52.304
What was life like in terms of getting a date, going to a movie, or anything like that?

19:53.385 --> 19:58.850
Well, for me, it really didn't exist.

20:00.251 --> 20:04.335
Football season, you could normally get a date from your girlfriend at home.

20:05.075 --> 20:07.418
come up for the football weekend or the football game.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.542
I never dated anybody in the area.

20:11.663 --> 20:15.849
How did those girls from home, how did they get to College Station?

20:15.869 --> 20:16.569
Various ways.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.211
Usually two or three of them would come together.

20:18.672 --> 20:19.834
One of them will have a car.

20:20.695 --> 20:22.917
A couple of them would come up with their parents.

20:23.098 --> 20:23.999
And where did they stay?

20:24.620 --> 20:26.582
The ones I had dates with stayed at MSC.

20:29.406 --> 20:33.771
Further down the road, when my wife and I started dating, she wasn't my wife then, she stayed at Ms.

20:33.791 --> 20:34.592
Pinburton's house.

20:35.213 --> 20:37.356
I guess you, did you know them?

20:37.436 --> 20:38.778
Oh yes, yes.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.781
Do you remember what the charge was?

20:40.821 --> 20:42.723
Two dollars a night if I remember right.

20:42.743 --> 20:46.368
And about how many might stay at the Penberthy's at one time?

20:48.371 --> 20:51.375
I don't know, five or six or eight or something like that.

20:51.475 --> 20:53.198
And they provided breakfast?

20:53.678 --> 20:58.745
They provided coffee and a roll I think, or coffee and some sort of rolls for breakfast.

20:58.765 --> 20:59.727
It was a heck of a deal.

20:59.807 --> 21:03.752
And in those days, one, we couldn't afford a hotel.

21:04.070 --> 21:05.332
Two, there weren't any there.

21:05.352 --> 21:09.316
And most of the girls' mothers aren't one of them coming up to stay in a hotel anyway.

21:10.798 --> 21:17.226
As far as you were aware, how were young women treated when they came to A&M for a weekend?

21:17.346 --> 21:18.508
Very courteously.

21:18.648 --> 21:23.274
I mean, it was ladies and gentlemen, pretty much.

21:23.994 --> 21:25.416
I never heard of any incidents.

21:26.818 --> 21:29.701
We were so glad to have ladies.

21:29.982 --> 21:32.625
Did they still bring loads of Tessies?

21:33.398 --> 21:35.501
No, I don't know what that is.

21:37.043 --> 21:46.514
In earlier years, TWU girls would come one or two football weekends on the train or on the bus, and there would be moose pots and beast buckets.

21:47.896 --> 21:53.683
You and your buddies would do a pot of money, and the one that got stuck with the worst blind date got the money.

21:53.703 --> 21:54.664
I heard the story.

21:54.684 --> 21:57.548
In fact, we had some moose pots on some court trips.

21:57.568 --> 22:01.353
That was a terribly mean thing to do to some poor girl.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.355
We did go to TWU.

22:04.010 --> 22:05.992
We called it T.W.

22:06.313 --> 22:07.734
Zoo.

22:08.395 --> 22:15.783
They had a dance or something up there and Aggies called it the Pig Push.

22:15.883 --> 22:21.310
Now we showed up for that thing before the TCU game when we were fish.

22:21.330 --> 22:26.756
And I ran into a gal that I went to high school with.

22:26.776 --> 22:31.221
And she was dating a guy that lived down the street from me.

22:31.241 --> 22:33.223
And I just kind of barely remember all that stuff.

22:33.828 --> 22:36.733
Yes ma'am?

22:36.793 --> 22:36.993
No.

22:40.719 --> 22:42.883
Let's see, we were talking about TWU.

22:43.343 --> 22:46.829
Describe a court trip.

22:46.849 --> 22:56.084
Well, in fact, the first court trip that we had was to the TCU game in Fort Worth in the fall of 67.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.047
That's when we went to TWU.

22:58.067 --> 22:59.650
We knew we were going to do it all.

23:00.203 --> 23:03.427
So we went to a friend of mine's house in Dallas or one of our fish buddies house.

23:03.588 --> 23:05.690
How did you get up there?

23:06.191 --> 23:11.158
His car, he had a car, a couple of other guys had cars so we rode together.

23:12.199 --> 23:15.163
We had the number varies depending on who you talk to.

23:15.223 --> 23:22.774
We had somewhere between 18 and 25 fish staying in this guy's parent's house.

23:22.794 --> 23:24.836
And it's something we still all talk about.

23:24.856 --> 23:26.098
He's still a very good friend.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.962
He's a very successful contractor in Arlington.

23:29.853 --> 23:35.118
His mom kicked, I don't know how many pounds of bacon, but it was your typical deal.

23:35.158 --> 23:36.139
We were sleeping everywhere.

23:36.179 --> 23:41.464
You know, she sewed our buttons on and everything we'd screwed up.

23:41.845 --> 23:43.987
That's the most memorable trip.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.688
Alright, so you're there.

23:45.769 --> 23:49.452
What did you all do on Friday night and Saturday and Saturday night?

23:51.214 --> 23:59.522
Friday night, we just actually bummed around Dallas to some of his old homes.

23:59.755 --> 24:06.864
My mother had a 64 Chevrolet Impala and for some reason she gave the keys to me.

24:07.825 --> 24:10.949
She said you take my car and I'll go wherever you want, just be careful.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.552
So I drove her car all weekend.

24:13.592 --> 24:16.415
We followed each other because we couldn't all get in one car.

24:17.436 --> 24:19.299
So we poked around Dallas I guess that night.

24:19.479 --> 24:21.982
The next night, the next Saturday was the game.

24:23.824 --> 24:25.226
I may have that background.

24:25.246 --> 24:28.750
Now you said Dallas, but you said the trip was to Fort Worth.

24:32.729 --> 24:36.974
We worked up in the ball game and then that night we had to dance.

24:37.034 --> 24:39.437
We were all batching it, you know.

24:39.457 --> 24:39.918
It was a bunch of guys.

24:39.938 --> 24:41.019
What did you do on Saturday night?

24:41.079 --> 24:42.401
The dance at TWU?

24:42.641 --> 24:43.162
I think so.

24:43.802 --> 24:44.443
I believe that's what it was.

24:44.503 --> 24:45.725
Now how did you get this date?

24:46.706 --> 24:47.327
Didn't have a date.

24:47.347 --> 24:48.328
Oh, you didn't have a date.

24:48.348 --> 24:49.730
I just ran into a gala.

24:49.750 --> 24:50.130
Okay.

24:51.352 --> 24:55.416
What kind of behavior was there at these dances?

24:57.479 --> 25:00.002
Always, you know, always.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.851
It wasn't rowdy, I'll say that.

25:04.894 --> 25:11.665
We got into our court parties and that might be the first place a lot of people drank, to the court party.

25:12.606 --> 25:15.050
And some of them couldn't handle it and those kind of things.

25:15.090 --> 25:16.753
But I never saw anybody get out of line.

25:16.773 --> 25:18.135
I never saw anybody have a fight.

25:18.415 --> 25:20.078
You don't remember anybody getting arrested.

25:20.438 --> 25:20.739
I don't.

25:21.159 --> 25:21.780
I don't.

25:23.062 --> 25:25.907
Then you all came back when?

25:26.407 --> 25:27.930
Sunday evening as late as possible.

25:28.170 --> 25:29.432
All right.

25:31.353 --> 25:35.939
And on a court trip were handles dropped pretty well?

25:35.959 --> 25:40.584
I think so.

25:40.845 --> 25:43.107
I don't really remember that, to tell you the truth.

25:43.128 --> 25:46.211
What if somebody didn't go on the court trip?

25:47.773 --> 25:49.295
You probably had to be in the hospital.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.679
You had to have a good excuse.

25:53.180 --> 25:55.723
I don't know anybody that didn't go.

25:55.872 --> 25:57.234
I haven't heard of any stories.

25:57.954 --> 25:59.156
I was wondering.

26:00.537 --> 26:04.762
Let's see, now you started dating your wife-to-be while you were a student?

26:05.002 --> 26:06.384
Yes, sir.

26:06.704 --> 26:14.473
Do you remember, were there any special dates that now as you look back on that those really were... Well, we had a lot of good ones.

26:14.493 --> 26:15.795
I met her in the fall of 69.

26:16.115 --> 26:20.019
She lived and worked in Houston.

26:20.039 --> 26:24.985
She was a cousin of my roommates, I guess.

26:25.268 --> 26:27.470
date her fiance, soon to be fiance.

26:28.371 --> 26:32.975
So I always had trouble getting dates.

26:34.816 --> 26:38.820
My friend's cousin lined her up to come up for the weekend.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.922
That's where we met, behind dorm three.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.063
So it was a blind date?

26:42.123 --> 26:44.925
Blind date, blind as it could be.

26:45.005 --> 26:46.106
Everything hit off pretty well.

26:46.126 --> 26:49.709
We'd been married for 27 years.

26:49.790 --> 26:53.773
So did you think that she was kind of special quickly?

26:54.293 --> 26:55.174
I guess I did, yeah.

26:55.454 --> 26:58.357
Did you propose or anything while you were still at A&M?

26:58.737 --> 26:59.017
No.

26:59.718 --> 27:00.999
Okay, yeah.

27:01.339 --> 27:07.565
Alright, let's jump forward now to boot dance, ring dance, anything like that.

27:09.887 --> 27:10.588
Okay, well.

27:10.628 --> 27:13.030
Describe those, where they were and what.

27:13.510 --> 27:19.756
The boot dance was, was it held in?

27:20.637 --> 27:21.878
It was held in Duncan.

27:21.898 --> 27:22.198
Oh really?

27:22.519 --> 27:22.879
Okay.

27:22.899 --> 27:23.980
The boot dance was in Duncan.

27:27.672 --> 27:33.782
I was with the same girl on both of them.

27:33.802 --> 27:38.028
The dance was of course the night of following the final review, our junior year.

27:38.048 --> 27:46.942
And then the ring dance of next year when they returned them.

27:46.962 --> 27:48.925
And what did the young ladies wear?

27:49.105 --> 27:52.030
Well they were formal, it was all formal stuff.

27:52.050 --> 27:55.215
We were in our dress uniforms.

27:56.039 --> 27:59.285
And the girls all wore formal dresses.

28:00.787 --> 28:03.192
Bonfires while you were there.

28:03.873 --> 28:05.576
Where were they and what were they like?

28:05.676 --> 28:07.179
They were on Duncan Field.

28:07.199 --> 28:09.523
They were behind Duncan Hall.

28:09.543 --> 28:15.654
And probably maybe 8,000 or 10,000 people would be there.

28:15.714 --> 28:17.076
Does that sound about right?

28:17.156 --> 28:17.617
I bet so.

28:18.058 --> 28:18.739
Sounds about right.

28:19.343 --> 28:29.194
And then, you know, it got to where it was just too big, too many people, probably a fire hazard as well, so they moved it over a little bit.

28:29.214 --> 28:30.436
But not during your time?

28:30.456 --> 28:30.676
No.

28:31.597 --> 28:32.198
Did you help?

28:33.479 --> 28:35.622
What role did you play as a freshman?

28:35.642 --> 28:42.730
Well, our outfit was what they called the stack outfit, and we worked mainly at the bonfire site.

28:44.072 --> 28:48.777
I remember once or twice we went to the cut, and that was early on.

28:50.056 --> 28:59.912
Maybe I didn't know what was going on when I was there, but it seems to me the bonfire, when we had it, went up a lot quicker.

28:59.992 --> 29:03.858
And, you know, they seem to plan it now about the time the other one's cleaned up.

29:04.399 --> 29:06.562
It's a year-round process.

29:07.263 --> 29:15.777
And I'm sure there was some planning going on prior to that, but we never got hot and heavy on building the bonfire until after the rice game.

29:16.482 --> 29:21.571
We played Rice on Saturday and we always played Texas the following Thursday.

29:21.591 --> 29:27.181
In those next three or four days, that was pushed to finish the bonfire.

29:27.201 --> 29:30.947
No incidents or accidents during your days?

29:32.311 --> 29:34.095
Let's see.

29:36.059 --> 29:37.001
Texas games.

29:37.161 --> 29:43.936
Any Texas games that really stand out in your... Well, the first one, we beat them 10-7 in the fall of 1967.

29:47.523 --> 29:52.193
We were down there on the field, excuse me, on the track.

29:52.612 --> 29:58.440
ready to take the yellow leaders off, and we had a goal line stand to make my air stand up and out and think about it.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.723
I saw you looking at your ring as you were saying that.

30:00.764 --> 30:02.165
We beat them 10 to 7.

30:02.246 --> 30:08.054
And then Dean Stallings went on to win against Alabama in the Cotton Bowl, and Barry Bryant carried him off the field.

30:08.074 --> 30:12.100
So that was probably the most memorable.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.645
We didn't beat Texas for the rest of them for the following three years that I was there.

30:15.665 --> 30:16.486
Terry?

30:16.506 --> 30:16.786
Yes.

30:18.008 --> 30:18.529
Terry's going to be there.

30:18.549 --> 30:19.530
Terry might be there in just a minute.

30:24.573 --> 30:28.299
Did you go to any Silver Taps?

30:28.620 --> 30:29.721
Oh yeah, all of them.

30:29.741 --> 30:31.785
What was Silver Taps in meaning?

30:32.226 --> 30:34.690
Well, it was very... What did it mean to you?

30:34.930 --> 30:37.614
Well, the first one was kind of scary.

30:37.634 --> 30:41.901
You know, everything's blacked out and we're freshmen and never been to one.

30:41.922 --> 30:47.911
You're instructed early on what it is and don't talk on the way over, don't talk on the way back, don't talk until the sun comes up.

30:49.153 --> 30:51.357
And we pretty much follow all of those.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.802
all those rules.

30:53.683 --> 30:58.249
It was especially emotional or meaningful when it was someone you knew.

30:59.030 --> 31:02.154
And in those days the school wasn't that large.

31:02.855 --> 31:04.537
If there was somebody in the Corps, you knew them.

31:05.518 --> 31:13.349
And I knew a couple people that died when they were in school, mostly due to car accidents.

31:13.369 --> 31:20.398
It's a very, it's an eerie feeling and a very fitting tribute.

31:21.020 --> 31:25.219
Did you and your friends take it seriously?

31:25.239 --> 31:25.562
Oh, sure did.
