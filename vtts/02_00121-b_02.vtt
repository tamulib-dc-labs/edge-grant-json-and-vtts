WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:07.280
Not the top 10, not top 5 or 10. But top 20, 25%. And 
what is impressive about that is that when you look

00:08.764 --> 00:17.365
at the top 10 or 15, they've been around forever. 
And this new college made those quantum leaps. And

00:23.055 --> 00:30.405
I attribute that to the leadership of those two 
deans, Hubert and then Corrigan, and the faculty.

00:30.645 --> 00:36.152
Because the faculty came in just running right off 
the bat. And they started getting recognition in

00:36.312 --> 00:42.040
publishing and in research. And we got 
recognition very quickly. Who are some of those

00:47.467 --> 00:50.892
star faculty members that are worthy of note? 
Well, I think in the area of children's

00:52.474 --> 01:01.367
literature, Donna Norton certainly stands out. 
Donna Norton is probably the number one figure in

01:06.468 --> 01:10.994
children's literature in the country. Bill 
Rupley and Mark Sadowski are probably two of the

01:11.375 --> 01:20.168
leading researchers and publishers in the field 
of reading. We've had some highly successful

01:22.391 --> 01:32.425
research and grants people in math education and 
science education.

01:36.421 --> 01:38.263
You're talking about the college now? Mm-hmm. 
Okay, in the college? Well, certainly, I can't

01:41.888 --> 01:49.677
think of one of the names in Ed Syke that came out 
of... He'd been at the University of Nebraska and

01:50.819 --> 01:57.687
came into Ed Syke, but he was a very prominent... 
person in that whole field of educational

01:58.240 --> 02:02.426
psychology for life. I can't think of his name 
right now. Jim McNamara had established himself

02:06.312 --> 02:16.227
nationally in educational statistics, was well 
recognized in that field.

02:19.832 --> 02:23.758
Statewide, probably the early people that would 
be recognized would have been because of their

02:24.430 --> 02:32.605
educational administration type background. 
You know, the Frank Huberts, the Paul Henslings,

02:32.645 --> 02:37.815
the Les Richardsons. Carl Landis and his whole 
effort over in that field with the human resource

02:38.521 --> 02:57.789
research that they were doing, particularly in 
the field of smoking, they were, they don't get, I

02:38.521 --> 02:57.789
think, they don't get enough recognition. They 
were pioneers. They were the early pioneers in

02:59.591 --> 03:02.976
identifying the hazards of smoking. I can 
remember that when I first came to Texas A&M. So

03:09.808 --> 03:16.119
we're talking about 1969, 1970, these guys were 
way, way ahead of the game. Are

03:17.442 --> 03:27.900
there some opportunities that in hindsight, are 
there some opportunities that we missed? You know

03:29.635 --> 03:34.861
clarity of looking backward or if we had known then 
what we know now we would have done this or that.

03:44.533 --> 03:44.773
All right. Let me ask a different way. Can you think 
of any individual that we lost or that we didn't get

03:46.515 --> 03:52.943
that we might have gotten or might have kept. I 
can't, Haskell. Now, when you talk to other

03:55.916 --> 04:02.467
department heads in other departments, you might 
find that. One of the things that I came away with in

04:03.449 --> 04:15.811
that role were the number of people I didn't want 
coming to Texas A&M that I would encounter. I

04:16.472 --> 04:18.255
remember the year that I mentioned I hired Jack 
Campbell because my interview with him up at

04:18.995 --> 04:28.948
Chicago, Illinois during a national convention. 
I had one fellow come in there that was with the

04:29.749 --> 04:38.860
University of California, and he really wanted 
that job. And he only wanted five students, one

04:40.375 --> 04:48.987
seminar, and about $15,000 more than I was 
offering. Well, I didn't want that type person at

04:49.508 --> 04:52.012
all. And you would run into a lot of people that you 
interviewed like that, because they were kind of

04:52.593 --> 05:00.064
prima donnas. They just wanted five students, 
five doctoral students, and a lot of money, and

05:00.945 --> 05:08.416
just leave me alone type thing. We were 
developing. Yeah, we needed workers. We needed

05:12.547 --> 05:17.780
people that understood what the real world of work 
was in education. Did you and your colleagues in

05:18.441 --> 05:24.957
these years, did you all think that progress was 
being made? Yes, I think so. I think there was,

05:27.102 --> 05:31.888
especially in those early years, there was a great 
cohesiveness. We used to go to Savisa and have

05:33.509 --> 05:40.878
lunch together and just continue our 
conversations that may have started at a faculty

05:33.509 --> 05:40.878
meeting. We just continued them out there in the 
lunch hour. A lot of cohesiveness. Now, you moved

05:45.744 --> 05:50.489
from the fourth floor, was the fourth floor of 
academic? Yes. To? Third floor of academic. Third

05:53.893 --> 05:54.814
floor, and then? And then by that time the new 
Harrington Building had opened and we moved over

05:55.148 --> 06:00.434
to the Harrington Building. And that's where you 
were until you retired? Yes. Peggy Ritchie and I go

06:05.071 --> 06:09.118
back a long way. Describe her as the key person in 
the dean's office. Well, she was extremely

06:13.325 --> 06:18.733
dependable, courteous. You just loved Peggy 
Ritchie. If you wanted a secretary in a dean's

06:22.440 --> 06:30.673
office, you wouldn't go beyond Peggy Ritchie. 
just just a gem very informative she's very

06:30.653 --> 07:00.205
knowledgeable she knew what was going on and again 
I think Dean Hubert relied on her a lot and felt

06:30.653 --> 07:00.205
comfortable giving her responsibilities as a 
secretary head secretary and I can't imagine her

06:30.653 --> 07:00.205
ever overstepping her appropriate 
responsibility never i don't think i ever heard

07:00.792 --> 07:30.580
her say uh... bad word and negative or have a 
negative comment about anyone but i also can't

07:00.792 --> 07:30.580
imagine anybody being able to put one over on her 
because she was pretty uh... pretty savvy and

07:00.792 --> 07:30.580
pretty pretty uh... clear-headed uh... let's see 
do you remember uh... anywhere in uh... the

07:00.792 --> 07:30.580
department of the country do you remember anytime 
where there was just some real snafu. Well, I don't

07:34.234 --> 07:35.736
know. When you say snafu, you mean where things 
didn't jive? Yeah, yeah. They were completely off

07:41.521 --> 07:43.263
balance. Yeah, about, I'm going to say about 20 
years into the College of Education,

07:43.283 --> 07:54.994
the fragmenting began to emerge. And I think that 
maybe that happens after you get a faculty that's

07:59.703 --> 08:19.293
been established and they're moving along with 
their program and new faculty are coming in with

07:59.703 --> 08:19.293
new ideas and they want their kind of program, you 
know, to emerge and you begin to get kind of a clash

07:59.703 --> 08:19.293
here. I would describe it this way, probably the 
first 20 years it was department within a college

08:29.217 --> 08:36.929
and all of our effort was toward the students. The 
fragmented segment started when numbers of new

08:38.592 --> 08:52.373
faculty or faculty after a few years wanted 
specialization you know don't get me involved

08:52.572 --> 09:17.584
with those other people this is my field very 
narrow that's right and and of course they do good

08:52.572 --> 09:17.584
things you know if you're looking for 
specialization they have really specialized and

08:52.572 --> 09:17.584
can tell you the the finer things of whatever 
they've specialized in but There's a trade-off.

09:19.807 --> 09:29.841
When you go that deep into specialization, you 
lose track of what the overall mission and the

09:19.807 --> 09:29.841
overall picture is. And when we celebrated our 
30th College of Education 30th anniversary, I

09:30.141 --> 09:43.740
took the lead in writing up the history on the 
Department of Curriculum Instruction,

09:30.141 --> 09:43.740
Educational Curriculum Instruction. And when I 
finished, I finished with the words, quo vadis,

09:43.720 --> 09:50.427
wherefore goest thou? Because I think that's what 
happens. People begin to lose, what's the

09:53.550 --> 09:56.473
mission? What are the objectives? How do we work 
together to get there? And you get fragmented

10:01.498 --> 10:06.003
things going on. Now, I'm not going to ask you the 
negative. Who were your favorite colleagues? Oh,

10:11.277 --> 10:12.760
there were so many. Gosh. Short time that he was 
there, Jerry Salick, because we were involved

10:16.487 --> 10:25.465
from the very beginning with trying to get new 
programs started. He left, went up to New Mexico.

10:28.270 --> 10:36.582
David David, Bob Schutz, just really top-flight 
people. Jack Campbell, a wonderful guy. The

10:38.404 --> 10:49.300
new faculty that came in, like the Donna Nortons 
and the Bill Rupleys and the Donna Wisemans

10:49.280 --> 10:52.283
Sadowskis and the Patlarks and so forth. Just 
really fine, fine people. In more recent years, I

10:57.568 --> 11:08.298
only knew him for a short period because I retired, 
but Charlie Lamb came into math education out of

10:57.568 --> 11:08.298
the university. He'd been an associate professor 
over at UT Austin and came over, joined us as a full

11:08.318 --> 11:16.085
professor in math education. Just really fine. 
Because I had been department head, I was

11:19.418 --> 11:35.672
associating with people out in the other 
departments, and I just found people like Jim

11:19.418 --> 11:35.672
Boone and Carl Landis and Leonard Ponder and all of 
those department heads and people were were

11:36.243 --> 11:37.344
really good people. I think Corrigan and Hubert 
both had done a good job in selecting people to

11:37.444 --> 11:50.661
assume responsibilities in those roles and 
enjoyed working with them. They were easy to work

11:50.701 --> 11:54.646
with, just easy to work with. You mentioned 
continuing conversations from the department on

11:54.666 --> 12:01.334
over to lunch at Sabisa. Yes. When did that start? 
When did that begin? Almost immediately, yeah.

12:05.386 --> 12:07.829
And how many years did it go on? Probably a good ten 
years. I would say this first signs of fragmenting

12:12.135 --> 12:27.917
didn't come in until maybe... See, Bob Schutz was 
department head for ten years, and I would say only

12:12.135 --> 12:27.917
the last couple of years where all of us began to see 
it. But I'd say, you know, my time and seven, eight

12:28.522 --> 12:40.624
years under Bob's time, there was a very cohesive 
group. And as I say, the fragmented people, the

12:40.744 --> 12:49.359
people that I associated with that 
fragmentation, didn't want to do that. They

12:49.419 --> 12:50.361
weren't. interested in having lunch. I think they 
were more interested in pursuing their their own

12:53.234 --> 12:59.001
specialization or whatever, you know. I always 
worry if those people fall within what I call the

12:59.690 --> 13:05.495
missionary complex. By that I mean the person who 
feels that he or she is doing us a favor by being

13:07.117 --> 13:22.231
here, that they've come from a superior 
civilization, that we're behind the times, and

13:07.117 --> 13:22.231
they're going to be here doing missionary 
service, and then they will return and leave us

13:07.117 --> 13:22.231
peasants. And I always worry about that. I think 
there's some truth to that. Now, we've had a couple

13:26.555 --> 13:29.578
people like that who have kind of come in with that 
attitude and have left, but have come back. Oh,

13:35.187 --> 13:37.070
good, good, good. And said, this is where I want to 
be. But apparently, for whatever reason, they had

13:39.854 --> 13:44.621
to experience that. They had to go through this 
missionary approach and saying, you know, we're

13:44.821 --> 13:56.578
coming out of a program that's above you, et 
cetera, et cetera, and I'm going back there, only

13:44.821 --> 13:56.578
to find out that when they got back there, that 
wasn't. what it looked like when they had been a

13:57.824 --> 14:01.155
student or whatever. And now they wanted to come 
back. And they were leaving tenured positions

14:05.007 --> 14:10.585
elsewhere, pretty good positions, just to come 
back. Now you served how many years here? Thirty. I

14:16.308 --> 14:17.169
was here thirty years. Thirty years, exactly. Do 
you have any advice on this? I've just appointed

14:24.076 --> 14:25.877
you as the consultant. Do you have any advice for 
the College of Education today?

14:32.804 --> 14:40.892
I would really like to see them come back to 
spending more of a informal, camaraderie

14:41.682 --> 15:02.341
kind of building an atmosphere of cohesiveness 
again, like we had those first 15, 20 years, where

14:41.682 --> 15:02.341
we really did have a mission we understood and 
goals to be accomplished. And we're not afraid to

15:03.442 --> 15:08.247
be innovative and experimental, if you want to 
call it. Because I think in education today, we're

15:08.902 --> 15:16.176
kind of faltering all across the country. And what 
worked 20 years ago is still there. And that's not

15:23.870 --> 15:25.313
the case. Things have changed. I think there are 
some signs of spurts. Although I'm only getting it

15:32.392 --> 15:37.237
from the outside now because I've been away for 
three years. But I'm beginning to see signs where

15:37.357 --> 15:45.345
they're, for example, this whole thrust with the 
internet and technology. I'm seeing and hearing

15:46.647 --> 16:00.441
comments by people out of the College of Education 
that maybe they are locking into that and

15:46.647 --> 16:00.441
recognizing that this thing is going to be huge. 
and it's going to impact education at all levels. I

16:05.453 --> 16:06.499
don't care if it's pre-school years to doctoral 
program years. The internet and technology are

16:12.807 --> 16:19.456
going to just have a tremendous impact. And I think 
all the research and grantsmanship that's going

16:19.596 --> 16:28.609
on out there now to get into that ballpark. And 
they're having some success. They're hitting on

16:32.028 --> 16:37.055
some million-dollar grants out there now in that 
field. So I'm glad to see that. But they're going to

16:40.599 --> 16:52.435
have to work at how do you rally then the rest, the 
whole, to get behind this as a mission or a goal or

16:40.599 --> 16:52.435
objective type of thing. That would be an 
undertaking. Are there some other schools in

16:57.560 --> 17:05.530
education nationally that have made similar 
kinds of rapid progress? None really come to my

17:07.153 --> 17:09.716
mind, Haskell. All the time that I was active out 
there and even being out of the scene now for three

17:10.357 --> 17:22.032
years, I don't see the rapid growth the rapid 
impact that our colleagues seem to have in such a

17:22.012 --> 17:28.239
short period of time. So that in the big leagues, 
the University of Texas at Austin and us, is there

17:29.180 --> 17:37.089
anybody else in Texas you'd put in that big league? 
Not in Texas. What about in the Southwest? States

17:41.534 --> 17:42.355
around us?

17:45.739 --> 17:47.882
I guess you'd have to include LSU. Okay. But other 
than that, I'm just not willing to put any of them in

17:51.779 --> 17:56.592
there. Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, I'm not ready 
to, uh-uh. Alabama, all of those. I don't think so.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.355
All right, let's see. I'm getting close to the end 
of the thoughts that I had. Are there some topics

18:13.401 --> 18:16.426
that we've not touched on that you wanted to be 
sure? You've done a pretty thorough job. In fact,

18:18.149 --> 18:24.160
you've raised a lot of questions that I would not 
have even thought to ask about. And of course,

18:24.200 --> 18:29.008
without catalogs and so forth, there were things 
that i'm sure i've overlooked are there some

18:29.528 --> 18:53.342
people that that we haven't mentioned that if you 
if they could be here today that you'd want to thank

18:29.528 --> 18:53.342
well um all the people i've mentioned yeah but in 
addition to any that we haven't mentioned did i

18:29.528 --> 18:53.342
mention don barker yes yeah certainly uh don oh my

18:56.917 --> 18:58.801
Okay, well, all right. Two other things before the 
last question. One is, if you have any A&M

19:03.132 --> 19:08.023
related... uh paraphernalia materials pictures 
and so forth that at some point you are want to get

19:08.493 --> 19:32.998
rid of i beg you please pass it on to the a m archives 
it'll be safer there than any other place that's

19:08.493 --> 19:32.998
good and then the the next last question is let's 
make believe that someone came up to you and handed

19:08.493 --> 19:32.998
you a check for a million dollars and there was only 
one requirement. You had to pass it on to Texas A&M,

19:34.541 --> 19:38.970
but you could decide how it was spent. What would 
you tell A&M to do with it? In other words, what are

19:42.276 --> 19:47.967
your keenest interests at A&M? I think I'd almost 
go with scholarships. For whom? Well, coming out

19:57.355 --> 20:01.981
of education, I wanted to go to the College of 
Education.

20:04.884 --> 20:09.590
Undergraduates, graduates, rich, poor, special 
major? I think I would want to go to... the graduate

20:17.292 --> 20:35.554
level in this whole field of educational 
technology because I still see that as the area

20:17.292 --> 20:35.554
that really needs to be tapped in a big way, that 
they need to really jump into You know, full force.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.436
I think the others will continue. All the other 
programs, I think, will continue. Reading, math,

20:47.121 --> 20:53.889
education, science, ed administration, 
educational psychology, et cetera. But unless

20:54.851 --> 21:04.663
they can latch on to that one, I think somebody is 
going to take the lead, and they're going to run off

20:54.851 --> 21:04.663
with that. And we would have a chance, I think, 
since we're now a pretty well-established

21:05.656 --> 21:22.003
college, that if we started really making that a 
high top priority, we could become one of the

21:05.656 --> 21:22.003
leading colleges of education just because of 
that. Last question. What feelings are in your

21:24.006 --> 21:26.570
heart for Texas A&M now? Only the dearest. I love 
Texas A&M University. I think all of their

21:33.770 --> 21:48.595
traditions and the students, I think the students 
still continue to be, for the most part, what I saw

21:33.770 --> 21:48.595
the first 10 years or so that I spent here. And 
they're kind of the heart and soul of Texas A&M

21:49.817 --> 21:54.265
University. Let's quit there. Thank you.
