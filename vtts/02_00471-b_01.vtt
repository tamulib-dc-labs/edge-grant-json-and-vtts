WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:07.755
You were saying the things that got us into that 
situation. The things that got us into those

00:09.957 --> 00:17.285
situations, I think, are a breakdown in some of 
those qualities of leadership that I spoke about

00:09.957 --> 00:17.285
earlier. Integrity,

00:17.546 --> 00:31.101
openness,

00:17.546 --> 00:31.101
integrity, and... qualities of advisors

00:31.705 --> 00:57.696
it's just you know if if if those qualities had been 
as they should have been I don't think we'd had

00:31.705 --> 00:57.696
those things Watergate for instance I don't think 
well in first place it was bad judgment and

00:31.705 --> 00:57.696
judgment is a great part of leadership it was bad 
judgment initially it was integrity and honesty

00:59.009 --> 01:28.307
with the people that the president covered up what 
he did i'm not a expert politician but i think

00:59.009 --> 01:28.307
looking back on it had the president immediately 
said what happened opened up the files and said you

00:59.009 --> 01:28.307
know we made a mistake wipe it off i think it would 
have blown away but You know, there's nobody good

01:28.523 --> 01:33.929
enough liar to tell the same story over and over and 
keep it going. Yeah, right. And I'll tell you, he

01:35.250 --> 01:37.333
did that. Of course, there was a lot more to it than 
that, but, you know, you can just see faults of

01:37.573 --> 01:54.812
leadership all the way up and down the line that 
causes political crisis, military crisis, or

01:37.573 --> 01:54.812
crisis in the highway department, any of them, any 
crisis. Yeah, right. Let's... Do you have any

01:57.937 --> 02:04.325
other thoughts that you'd like to express on 
leadership before we turn to another topic? Well,

02:04.345 --> 02:05.947
I'd just say this. There is no substitute for 
leadership. There is no substitute.

02:18.241 --> 02:27.893
There's people that can succeed with one kind of 
leadership, as we said, another kind of

02:18.241 --> 02:27.893
leadership, and you've got one kind and I've got 
another. But you've got to have some quality of

02:28.565 --> 02:34.952
leadership, or you will go under. Your people will 
not respect you. And the many people who do not

02:37.915 --> 02:41.699
respect you, well, then you've got disaster. So 
I'll just sum it up. The importance of leadership

02:45.083 --> 02:50.769
is that it's an absolute must, or you're not going 
to succeed.

02:55.494 --> 02:55.794
Simple. Let's turn now. to Texas A&M. Back to Texas 
A&M, we talked about Texas A&M back in the 1930's

03:00.209 --> 03:04.654
when you were here. There have been some major 
changes at this institution since that time and

03:06.536 --> 03:23.375
I'd like your thoughts as a former student on the 
changes that came about at this university,

03:06.536 --> 03:23.375
especially in the 1960's. What are your thoughts 
on The end of the mandatory Corps of Cadets.

03:32.395 --> 03:36.020
Well, I think I could answer that this way. I think 
that we ought to have mandatory military training

03:36.040 --> 03:45.713
nationwide. I think everybody ought to serve some 
responsibility for the defense of this country. I

03:53.343 --> 03:55.626
think we're, whatever you call it, mandatory 
military or mandatory training. I think

04:00.765 --> 04:15.919
everybody ought to have some training in 
military, hospital, or some part of the welfare

04:00.765 --> 04:15.919
and defense of this country. Could you develop 
that? For a short time. How short? Oh, maybe a year,

04:20.683 --> 04:23.706
18 months. are something to get his foot in the door 
of knowing the responsibility, knowing the needs

04:24.040 --> 04:44.142
of defense, knowing the needs of the country, and 
above that, somebody knowing what his

04:24.040 --> 04:44.142
capabilities are, and have a record of him. This 
business of turning everybody loose and then have

04:44.182 --> 04:51.550
to go back and re... register and all this i think 
that's a wheel spinning i think it's a waste and i

04:51.884 --> 05:14.500
think it leads to unpreparedness so my thinking of 
that i think there should be if you if it's a

04:51.884 --> 05:14.500
military school i think you ought to have if you're 
physically capable i would i saw nothing wrong

04:51.884 --> 05:14.500
with having mandatory ROTC, two years. If people 
don't care for that any longer, then they go into

05:18.537 --> 05:23.442
the civilian. That would be like 18 months or a year 
or whatever outside. But I think where there's

05:29.567 --> 05:36.774
that privilege, anybody that doesn't take the 
opportunity of it, I think they're missing a great

05:29.567 --> 05:36.774
deal. Were you sorry then to see the university 
shift away from the mandatory report? Yes. And I

05:45.192 --> 05:46.574
know why they did it. You know, it was not popular. 
And I'm sure that it would have run off a lot of

05:49.119 --> 05:53.446
students. But, you know, I think maybe more 
schools should have it. I think it would not hurt to

05:59.616 --> 06:05.866
have a basic understanding of military 
responsibility. Because as far as you and I are

06:05.886 --> 06:11.115
sitting here, some of these days we may need it, or 
will need it, most likely. No, you said everybody.

06:13.485 --> 06:14.867
Are you including women? I don't see anything 
wrong with that. There would probably be more

06:20.994 --> 06:36.733
women that might have deferments or some such 
thing as that, but there still could be places of

06:20.994 --> 06:36.733
service. But I really can't see a great deal of 
difference. Depending on their marital status or

06:43.208 --> 07:01.015
their responsibility

06:43.208 --> 07:01.015
status or whatever, you know, the ladies have said 
that they want equal opportunities. I don't know

07:01.035 --> 07:06.062
why that shouldn't be one of them. I was not a bit 
sorry to see them integrated into the service. You

07:12.250 --> 07:13.271
could get a place. Now, let's talk about that for a 
minute. Did you have women under your command?

07:19.819 --> 07:22.383
They were just coming into the service. We had a few 
at that time, but it was not very prevalent at that

07:22.623 --> 07:28.891
time. How were they accepted? Oh, there was some 
reluctance,

07:32.115 --> 07:41.987
but, you know, the job they could do is as well as 
men. And I think it depends entirely upon their

07:42.777 --> 07:52.086
attitude because they have job skills just as in 
the civilian market. There are things that women

07:52.106 --> 07:55.649
do to exceed men. So, but it was slow. It was a thing 
that was, you know, they had to get used to. You told

08:05.678 --> 08:11.063
me two days ago, I believe, that you had In the 
420th, did you say 4,500 men and officers? At one

08:17.191 --> 08:17.832
time. At one time. How many of those were women? 
Very few. Half a dozen? I doubt if there were very

08:27.466 --> 08:30.390
many more than that. It was just a very few, and at 
this point I really don't remember. But they were

08:36.940 --> 08:41.286
just not significant at all. because see this was 
in 1971. Yeah.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.828
But uh- Did you recruit for women?

08:55.131 --> 08:56.553
I don't believe we did at that time. Had not and I 
guess they do now. And why didn't you? Because you

09:02.542 --> 09:03.443
had plenty of men. Well that's one thing we never 
were even up to the time I retired we we had not we did

09:04.545 --> 09:12.336
not have personnel problems in that respect. In 
fact, as I told you the other day, we had waiting

09:15.268 --> 09:18.973
lists. In fact, we had to keep a very

09:20.275 --> 09:33.452
well-oriented and well-run waiting list so that 
we could substantiate those that we took in.

09:37.357 --> 09:41.142
But I've always had a feeling that I'll let the 
person do the job that's best qualified

09:42.455 --> 09:55.190
regardless of their

09:42.455 --> 09:55.190
status in life, whether it's man, woman, or what. 
Now, speaking of women, what were your feelings

09:57.793 --> 10:05.222
when A&M allowed women You went to an all-male 
institution back in the 1930s, and now it's the

10:06.147 --> 10:13.013
freshman class is 51% women. What were your 
feelings about allowing women? I thought it was

10:16.997 --> 10:19.379
one of the smartest things they ever did.

10:22.802 --> 10:22.882
Why? Why is that? Well, because at first it's a 
tax-supported institution,

10:23.903 --> 10:35.614
and there are women who want to go to school, I think 
it, in my opinion, it

10:37.433 --> 10:45.103
enhanced even enrollment of men. There were a lot 
of people that would not go to an all-male school,

10:45.403 --> 10:54.035
and I'm sure the same as to an all-women's school. 
But,

10:54.055 --> 11:00.143
well, it just made sense. Why exclude any one 
gender? The school was there. They had the

11:08.947 --> 11:11.529
facilities. They had the capability. And in 
addition to that, I had a daughter that I wanted to

11:14.252 --> 11:20.417
go to school with. But I really thought that was a 
landmark decision. I was tickled to death. And I

11:26.743 --> 11:31.307
know that a lot of my colleagues don't agree with 
that. I'm talking about my vintage. In fact, I've

11:33.449 --> 11:34.930
had some My classmates say that Mr. Rudder was the 
downfall of any university because this happened

11:39.550 --> 11:54.768
under his rule, but I've had some very strong 
arguments with him that I think it put the place on

11:39.550 --> 11:54.768
an upward course. Oh, I thought he was great. I 
think I can predict this, but what do you think

11:56.070 --> 12:03.398
about racial integration that came about under 
General Rudder? There ain't nothing wrong with

12:05.167 --> 12:09.091
that either. Of course, over the last three 
interviews, you've sort of seen my feeling toward

12:09.111 --> 12:19.922
the black race particularly. And we just use all 
races. But the black race is the one that's mostly

12:21.463 --> 12:27.009
in controversy. But if they're academically 
qualified and have the intention to go, Well,

12:35.035 --> 12:37.339
that's like the women were. They were just as 
entitled to go as I was.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.373
There was tremendous growth. There were about, I 
think, 4,000 students when you were here in 1940,

12:45.475 --> 12:53.691
about that. Right about that. And as late as 1960, 
there were only around 6,000, 7,000, and now

12:57.192 --> 13:03.958
there's 31,000. What have you thought about this 
incredible growth that we've had? I don't

13:09.283 --> 13:10.164
understand it. Except that I think that it's a 
further mark of the quality of the institution. We

13:20.713 --> 13:26.018
were growing when other institutions had leveled 
off. And I have heard, well, one in particular, Dr.

13:27.213 --> 13:44.449
Williams, other than Mr. Rutter, say that we had 
been visited by people, administrators from

13:27.213 --> 13:44.449
other institutions, to find out what the recipe 
was. And I'm not sure they could tell them, other

13:44.909 --> 13:54.418
than these things that I've talked about, the 
quality of the institution,

13:55.529 --> 14:13.416
The openness of the administration, and the fact 
that the school's got a great reputation, and the

13:55.529 --> 14:13.416
fact that they finally saw fit to open it up to 
ladies, all races, and whatnot. But it's, I think,

14:14.738 --> 14:19.105
mainly it's the quality of the institution. I like 
to think that. Now let's talk about General

14:22.170 --> 14:23.832
Rudder. It was during his tenure in office that 
these changes took place. When did you first meet

14:30.597 --> 14:36.023
him?

14:36.043 --> 14:52.300
Well, I met him several times in the reserve 
program prior to his assuming the presidency of

14:36.043 --> 14:52.300
A&M in mutual reserve meetings and exercises and 
whatnot. but not really on a personal basis until

14:53.512 --> 15:01.083
about the time that he came to A&M. And I got better 
acquainted with him just by the fact that he was in

15:01.104 --> 15:07.113
town. But when I really got acquainted with him is, 
as I assumed, more responsibility in the highway

15:08.154 --> 15:21.915
department, because we had a great many mutual 
problems, highway department, university, with

15:08.154 --> 15:21.915
all their lands. and roads that were built in and 
around and through. And then his... So you were

15:27.673 --> 15:30.458
cooperating then with the president? And your 
district were cooperating to build roads? Sure.

15:36.827 --> 15:44.999
See, we, under my administration, we built Jersey 
Street, you know, right across the campus. We

15:45.100 --> 15:48.004
built the highway that's on the south side of the 
campus along with the railroad we built the

15:49.013 --> 16:16.877
underpass out there by the agriculture building 
and we widened and expanded jersey street i mean uh

15:49.013 --> 16:16.877
university drive we extended university drive 
back to the east

15:49.013 --> 16:16.877
expanded highway six you know just all around and 
through as well as the west loop the west loop

16:17.262 --> 16:21.707
around town entailed a great bit of university 
property. So I dealt with him on many very

16:22.668 --> 16:36.262
intricate and detailed planning of roads and 
facilities in and around the stadium and the

16:22.668 --> 16:36.262
university tubes. So would you explain how it 
worked? Would he take care of the roads inside the

16:39.225 --> 16:44.791
campus and you take, or how did it work? How was the 
relationship? Well, in a time that we had any plans

16:46.270 --> 17:11.302
for expansion or improvement adjacent to the 
campus or through any of the lands of the campus,

16:46.270 --> 17:11.302
some of it even had to go to the Board of Regents for 
approval because we got some land from them for the

16:46.270 --> 17:11.302
West Loop, for instance, and the Jersey Street. We 
took part of the lands of the university and he had

17:11.362 --> 17:14.286
to clear this through the Board of Regents. So as we 
would plan these facilities, we would work

17:17.697 --> 17:31.778
closely with him to get his ideas and input into how 
it could serve and what would be the best facility

17:17.697 --> 17:31.778
and where it ought to be and this sort of thing. And 
then, of course, we built it, but it was done with

17:31.798 --> 17:37.446
mutual coordination. Whose funds? Highway 
Department. Highway Department. They did not put

17:42.774 --> 17:44.256
any funds into any of the roads that we built in and 
around the university and where we had some of

17:44.725 --> 18:12.808
their lands it was it was donated to to the highway 
department to build roads on but it was highway

17:44.725 --> 18:12.808
funds which are some state and some federal

17:44.725 --> 18:12.808
when people work with other people it's usually 
rather easy to work with them and they're very

17:44.725 --> 18:12.808
cooperative when you're going to do something for 
them But when you're not going to do something for

18:13.109 --> 18:19.536
him, then things often change. What kind of man was 
General Rutter when you told him that you couldn't

18:19.856 --> 18:28.505
do something that he wanted accomplished? Well, 
he would immediately say, go back and think about

18:28.525 --> 18:34.351
it. I remember a very, very specific problem that 
we had that we We resolved, but it was not to his

18:40.852 --> 18:43.416
liking. And here again, I think that takes

18:44.818 --> 18:50.446
leadership. If I want you to do something that you 
don't want to do or you resist, it takes some

18:52.068 --> 19:04.547
leadership from me to convince you that it ought to 
be done or you ought to do it. We started to build

19:06.129 --> 19:07.551
Jersey Street. And we had already built the street 
on the west side of the campus by the railroad. And

19:15.723 --> 19:20.549
to get specific with you, we'd made it 57 feet wide. 
And it proved very shortly that it was too narrow.

19:26.877 --> 19:29.600
It congested when it parked along it. It just 
wasn't wide enough. You had no room for left turn

19:32.664 --> 19:34.806
movements. So it was under design. We made a 
mistake. We started to build Jersey Street. We

19:43.474 --> 19:53.008
designed it to have a 16-foot common left turn 
meeting, four running lanes, and two parking

19:43.474 --> 19:53.008
lanes. And Mr. Rudder never fell out of his chair 
when he saw what we had, because it was going to take

19:55.111 --> 20:03.323
part of his soccer field and part of the golf 
course. And he said, no way. says go back and do some

20:07.623 --> 20:36.128
figuring so we went back then we didn't do any more 
figuring we just let it rest a while went back to him

20:07.623 --> 20:36.128
and told him that we had come up with the idea that we 
were not we were not excessive in our design and

20:07.623 --> 20:36.128
that we felt like that's where it would be built and 
he said what about this street over here I said well

20:07.623 --> 20:36.128
it's too narrow I was used to making two mistakes 
But he still didn't like it, and he said, go back and

20:36.412 --> 20:39.376
think about it again. So we went back and pondered a 
while, and finally he called me and said, what do

20:41.199 --> 20:47.007
you think? And I said, well, Mr. Rutter, I am not 
going to be a party to making the same mistake

20:47.288 --> 20:52.495
twice. And I said, now, we've got the money for 
this. The highway department's ready to let the

20:56.981 --> 20:58.844
contract. And I think we're depriving the people 
of a facility But I would not recommend to the

21:04.340 --> 21:10.987
Highway Department to do the same thing we did 
before. His question to me is, have you been

21:11.007 --> 21:16.033
talking to some of my Board of Regents? And I said, 
well, certainly not. Why? He said, well, none of my

21:18.756 --> 21:26.925
Board of Regents told me at the last meeting, when 
you build Jersey Street, don't let them build it

21:18.756 --> 21:26.925
too narrow.

21:30.209 --> 21:34.093
Well, I won the battle with the help of somebody. 
man when he was when he had his headset it was

21:34.327 --> 22:03.034
difficult because he was a strong leader and he had 
his own ideas but I've met with him on lots of

21:34.327 --> 22:03.034
occasions lots of occasions and we were we were 
pretty much of the same mind he was progressive and

21:34.327 --> 22:03.034
wanted his money spent well didn't want to throw it 
away and of course I felt the same way sure but uh He

22:04.162 --> 22:06.144
was headstrong. He had his firm convictions. Of 
course, I admire a man with convictions. That gets

22:14.794 --> 22:16.235
us to the next question. What was your opinion of 
him as a person? I thought he was fantastic. I

22:21.000 --> 22:30.831
thought he was, well, of course, he was the most 
intimate president of A&M that I was ever

22:21.000 --> 22:30.831
socialized. I mean, my relations were intimate. I 
knew more of him, I dealt with him more, but I

22:33.035 --> 22:43.025
thought he was, I thought he did more for A&M than 
anybody before or after. I'm talking about

22:43.745 --> 22:49.591
because of the length of time he was there and the 
amount of changes made. I was a great admirer of

22:50.151 --> 22:51.673
his.

22:54.816 --> 23:01.422
I think he was a successful leader in both military 
and in this institution and I think Without

23:02.144 --> 23:12.520
question, he, I'll use the word, he fooled many of 
those people who were responsible for putting him

23:02.144 --> 23:12.520
in that position. Yeah, how did that come? Do you 
know anything about that? Only what I read, and

23:15.664 --> 23:29.365
that is that they figured he'd smoothly glide the 
boat along, wouldn't rock it, you know, and

23:15.664 --> 23:29.365
wouldn't upset anything, but I was mistaken about 
him. Well, was there a reasoning problem firing

23:31.658 --> 23:43.913
President Miller, it appears that the board 
pretty much rules the university. And when they

23:44.073 --> 23:51.662
saw these changes coming under General Rutter, 
why do you think? Do you think he was just too

23:51.682 --> 23:53.444
powerful? Why do you think that they gave him so 
much latitude And here again, I've just got to

24:01.679 --> 24:07.989
quote Joe Hanover, but I think they were pleased 
with what he was doing. Now that's the only answer I

24:09.111 --> 24:11.034
could have.

24:13.858 --> 24:17.804
You know, otherwise they probably wouldn't 
tolerate it. And some of the subsequent ones, they

24:18.986 --> 24:25.416
must not have been pleased with what was going on. 
But it was... getting too powerful, or whether it

24:26.789 --> 24:34.517
was didn't like the way it was administered, or 
just what, because they had that authority. And

24:35.518 --> 24:45.789
it's very evident to me that they must have been 
pleased with with John Rutter, because I don't

24:35.518 --> 24:45.789
think anybody's too powerful for him to take 
whatever action they see fit. Now, that's pure

24:46.830 --> 24:49.193
speculation.

24:53.797 --> 24:54.298
Finally, During this interview, we've examined 
early years, your education, your military

24:56.506 --> 25:11.220
career, both in active duty and the reserves, a lot 
of ideas and opinions that you've had about the

24:56.506 --> 25:11.220
military of Texas and on the leadership. We must 
have left out somewhere along the line some

25:12.601 --> 25:23.391
important issues that you'd like to discuss or 
opinions or any other aspects of your life, have

25:12.601 --> 25:23.391
we?

25:29.902 --> 25:45.022
Well, I guess inadvertently we may have, but I'm 
not real sure that I could start out and enumerate a

25:29.902 --> 25:45.022
lot of things.

25:45.162 --> 25:57.698
I just look back on both my military career and my 
civilian career and attribute my training at

25:45.162 --> 25:57.698
Texas A&M to a large degree for the success of both 
of them. I started my military career there. I

26:06.870 --> 26:09.992
started my civilian engineer career there. I 
think I had teachers and associates in both

26:12.314 --> 26:24.364
aspects that I have a great deal of respect for. I 
think we're largely responsible for motivating

26:27.496 --> 26:56.473
me into doing the things that I needed to do to get a 
good basic education in both I think once I got out

26:27.496 --> 26:56.473
and began to hit some of life's problems I I look 
back there to to really see you know what the what

26:56.757 --> 26:58.059
the foundation was. Of course, World War II coming 
along took us to a completely different vocation

26:59.922 --> 27:08.996
very shortly. I think the fact that I did have good 
training at A&M could very well be the reason I'm

27:09.016 --> 27:20.092
here today. I think it taught me 
self-preservation. I think it taught me respect

27:27.284 --> 27:29.027
for my fellow man. I think it taught me my 
responsibilities to the civilian world, to the

27:29.047 --> 27:41.084
military world, to my family, to my generations 
coming behind me. I think all these things are

27:41.404 --> 27:53.822
started to ferment and grow right there at Texas 
A&M.

27:53.842 --> 27:57.207
I had a man at Command General Staff, a man Colonel 
at the Command General Staff School that made a

27:58.233 --> 28:04.358
comment one time that has really stuck with me. We 
were just sitting around bullying one night in an

28:04.378 --> 28:23.755
off session and somebody asked him, Colonel Bones 
said, we get out of school, how are we going to know

28:04.378 --> 28:23.755
what we learned in this place? And Command General 
Staff is the school for higher commanders and

28:28.068 --> 28:46.724
staffs at Fort Leavenworth, you had so much stuff 
that was taught to you, so many leadership

28:28.068 --> 28:46.724
courses, so many tactics, you know, the gamut, 
just cram and cram and cram. He said, when you get

28:46.744 --> 28:57.433
through, even though you've passed examinations 
and you've passed critiques and all this, he says,

28:46.744 --> 28:57.433
when we get back home, how are we going to know what 
we learned at this place? And he said, when the

28:59.523 --> 29:09.999
problem arises and you find the solution to it, he 
says, you began to think a little bit, where did I

28:59.523 --> 29:09.999
learn this? Or where did I get the background to 
make this decision? He says, I think you'll

29:14.586 --> 29:18.612
remember that it was talked about at Fort 
Lattenworth. And you know, that has really stuck

29:19.874 --> 29:23.219
in my mind. And I have analyzed that a great many 
times after I'd find a solution to some kind of

29:27.873 --> 29:30.796
problem. I think, where did I learn that? Or who 
gave me the idea to do this? And I think that's a real

29:35.780 --> 29:50.955
good lesson in

29:35.780 --> 29:50.955
things where you have an opportunity to mingle 
with fellow man and go to school or study or

29:35.780 --> 29:50.955
research. It doesn't really do you any good right 
then. But you store it away. And one of these days

29:57.320 --> 30:02.645
you have to make a decision, problem arises, and 
looking for the answer. It's interesting to think

30:03.686 --> 30:06.429
back, where did I learn this? Or how did I decide 
this course of action? And he really gave me

30:11.634 --> 30:15.158
something to think about that day. I wish more 
people would think back on and try to analyze

30:15.178 --> 30:19.322
things in their life. Sure. It would mean my job a 
lot more. Yeah. I thought it was a terrific answer.

30:26.446 --> 30:27.027
And it did. When we got out of school up there, you 
know, I'm not sure if somebody had said, sit down

30:27.127 --> 30:35.499
there and write what all you learned up there. Man, 
you couldn't have. You mean at Fort Leavenworth?

30:38.343 --> 30:38.603
Yeah. When you got on? Yeah. You couldn't have. You 
could have maybe covered a cigarette paper or

30:40.646 --> 30:44.031
something like that. But, oh, it must have, you 
know, the stuff that you stored away there that you

30:44.051 --> 30:55.828
recalled when the time came, it made it a terrific 
learning process. and I tried to remember that all

30:57.850 --> 31:07.901
these subsequent schools and seminars that I was 
privileged to go to and as you say I went to a whole

30:57.850 --> 31:07.901
lot of them. What another question along these 
lines then let's say you would have gone to another

31:09.523 --> 31:27.722
university now of course this is all hypothetical

31:09.523 --> 31:27.722
but if you would have gone to another university do 
you feel that You would have had this training

31:28.208 --> 31:32.532
where you could make these decisions.
