00:03.777 --> 00:13.507
looking out into beautiful woods from a nice sitting room at 31 Forest Drive with Mac Prescott.

00:14.568 --> 00:20.114
And let's see, now use your mic and see if it works.

00:20.575 --> 00:26.601
I am sitting here with Haskell looking not out at the pretty woods, but at the front entrance.

00:31.686 --> 00:32.367
To begin,

00:32.752 --> 00:48.786
Mike, would you describe your experience growing up and World War II and academic experience before you came to A&M?

00:48.806 --> 00:52.414
I was born and reared in San Marcos.

00:54.706 --> 00:59.793
My parents, my mother was a native San Marcos.

00:59.833 --> 01:13.572
My father was from North Texas, and they settled there after my father's return from service in France in World War II, where he had been wounded by a gas attack.

01:13.632 --> 01:22.384
San Marcos at that time had a population of about 5,000 and didn't seem to change much during the time I was growing up.

01:22.735 --> 01:37.979
Of course, the earliest thing I can remember, or one of the earliest things I can remember is the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing depression which left its mark on my generation from then until the present time.

01:39.241 --> 01:42.646
I attended San Marcos Academy for one year.

01:42.726 --> 01:44.869
My mother taught me first grade subjects.

01:44.929 --> 01:50.498
She had been a teacher, had been an English teacher, and also had taught elementary grades earlier.

01:50.967 --> 01:56.433
And she taught me first grade subjects at home, and I entered the second grade at San Marcos Academy.

01:57.554 --> 02:06.725
And then, the depression being what it was, I transferred to public schools the next year because there wasn't any tuition there, whereas there was at the academy.

02:07.786 --> 02:12.992
And I went through the public schools in San Marcos, graduating from high school in 1938.

02:13.732 --> 02:21.122
and immediately entered what was then Southwest Texas State Teachers College, which was quite small, 1,200 probably enrollment at that time.

02:22.444 --> 02:28.492
There I was under the influence of some teachers whom I would call inspirational, as a matter of fact.

02:30.776 --> 02:43.333
They were devoted to teaching, but some of them still had a strong commitment to research, and this undoubtedly affected my view on a future career, particularly

02:43.921 --> 02:55.146
I was influenced by a professor named Dr. C. Spurgeon Smith, who was head of the Department of Biology and who was

02:56.088 --> 03:03.699
A graduate of the University of Chicago, his PhD was from the University of Chicago, where he worked under the eminent physiologist A.J.

03:03.739 --> 03:04.280
Carlson.

03:04.941 --> 03:18.501
He inspired in all of us a desire to do research and to achieve things in a scientific field.

03:19.578 --> 03:34.193
I graduated in the summer of 1941 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a minor in biology and went down to enlist in the U.S.

03:34.253 --> 03:40.259
Navy in what they call the V-5 program, V-7 program, I believe it was.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.121
It was for deck officers.

03:42.141 --> 03:43.963
One was for flight officers, one for deck officers.

03:43.983 --> 03:48.808
I've forgotten the numeral by which they're designated.

03:49.227 --> 03:56.534
and it was found that I had a disorder in one of my kidneys.

03:56.554 --> 04:14.492
It turned out that it was displaced and not functioning properly, so I had an operation in the fall of 1941, spent three weeks in Santa Rosa Hospital in San Antonio getting my corrective measures done, and then was still recuperating

04:14.978 --> 04:30.131
On December 7th, 1941, when I was resting at home alone in the afternoon, my parents were off visiting relatives, also in San Marcos, called and said, are you listening to the radio?

04:30.171 --> 04:30.872
And I said, no.

04:30.932 --> 04:32.653
And they said, turn it on.

04:32.713 --> 04:34.395
The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor.

04:35.496 --> 04:39.979
So as soon thereafter as I could pass a physical, I enlisted.

04:40.059 --> 04:44.243
But meanwhile, I worked for about a year at the Dow Chemical Company.

04:44.662 --> 04:55.735
As a matter of fact, I enlisted on July 24, 1942 and was immediately sent back to Dow Chemical to await a call up to duty.

04:55.795 --> 05:01.281
Evidently, the backlog of personnel had grown so big that they couldn't accommodate everyone.

05:02.603 --> 05:12.154
I was called to active duty in March of 1943 and was sent to training in meteorology and still ground duty because of my operation.

05:13.383 --> 05:34.655
I graduated from meteorology school in November of 43 and was immediately assigned to San Marcos Army Airfield back in my hometown where I served in the base weather office and later then as an instructor in meteorology of the cadets who were navigation students.

05:36.939 --> 05:39.222
Subsequently, late in the war,

05:39.944 --> 05:44.628
By the way, once you got in training command, essentially you couldn't get out of training command in World War II.

05:44.709 --> 05:47.031
They tended to leave you there a long time.

05:48.412 --> 06:00.403
But late in the war, a teletype came through wanting two officers of my military specialty to report to Clovis, New Mexico for overseas assignment.

06:00.423 --> 06:08.331
And one of my friends and I volunteered and we got there, found our delight that they wanted us to fly weather reconnaissance.

06:09.020 --> 06:12.205
And so we had to pass a flight physical.

06:13.006 --> 06:20.978
And it's interesting that when the Army needed you to fly, you could pass the physical without much difficulty.

06:22.200 --> 06:22.680
So I did.

06:23.481 --> 06:28.950
And went overseas as a weather reconnaissance officer on the B-29 crew.

06:29.490 --> 06:36.681
I replaced the bombardier, and they installed weather instruments instead of a bombsite in our airplane.

06:37.218 --> 06:41.009
and I got over there just weeks before the war ended.

06:41.450 --> 06:42.574
Where were we?

06:42.654 --> 06:47.869
We went first of all to Tinian, joined the 58th Bomb Wing there,

06:48.777 --> 06:52.201
and stayed there until sometime after the war.

06:53.462 --> 07:02.933
And then we were sent down to Guam and made a part of the 502nd Bomb Group, which was in the 315th Wing.

07:03.974 --> 07:09.040
I was in the 468th Wing, excuse me, 468th Group, 58th Wing on Tanyan.

07:09.761 --> 07:15.848
I was in the 502nd Group, 315th Wing on Guam.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.969
Fountain Tanya and Guam, both very interesting places.

07:19.029 --> 07:28.477
They were a much more pleasant climate than I expected, except that during the rainy season, it rained all the time, essentially.

07:29.238 --> 07:31.199
In the dry season, it just rained once a day.

07:31.420 --> 07:40.287
But they were, temperature-wise, they were very moderate, and there were a lot of interesting things on the islands.

07:40.467 --> 07:46.172
I had become engaged before I went overseas, and so when I was

07:47.671 --> 07:54.781
When my overseas assignment was essentially over with, I was put on orders to come home.

07:54.922 --> 08:07.880
I came back, got back in the States in May of 46, and married Katherine Ann Kelly June 8, 1946.

08:08.081 --> 08:13.729
All right, then after that, you went back to school?

08:14.452 --> 08:18.298
I had worked for Dow Chemical, as I said, Texas Division.

08:19.019 --> 08:36.186
And after we married, I went down to Freeport to talk to them about resuming my job because the so-called GI Bill of Rights required an employer to offer a job to a person who had held it before entering military service.

08:37.468 --> 08:41.674
While I was there, one of my friends mentioned that A&M was hiring lab instructors.

08:41.975 --> 08:56.732
full-time and I thought this would be a good chance for me to see if I like graduate work because I could do it on a part-time basis and if I like teaching and so I that very day I drove up to College Station from Freeport met with Dr. C.C.

08:56.832 --> 09:11.188
Hedges head of the chemistry department and he hired me on the spot the system then in chemistry was that there were two lectures one recitation and a laboratory each week

09:11.827 --> 09:16.793
And the lectures were given by senior faculty members, usually full professors.

09:17.514 --> 09:22.701
And the recitation and the laboratories were conducted by instructors.

09:22.861 --> 09:26.625
We were really laboratory instructors, but they gave us the academic title of instructor.

09:27.567 --> 09:32.112
And each of us attended the lectures that our sections would be attending.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.877
So we knew exactly what had been covered in the lectures.

09:36.515 --> 09:42.260
When I started, the professor during the lecturing was Dr. Empty Harrington.

09:43.401 --> 09:54.771
And as a matter of fact, he had also taken the recitation and laboratory sections as an overload, and he was glad to see me arrive because I took these off of his hands.

09:55.272 --> 09:58.635
Describe, let's sidelight on him.

09:59.235 --> 10:03.319
Describe him as a lecturer, teacher.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.661
He was superb.

10:05.945 --> 10:27.936
He was articulate and very clear, and I understand I'm talking just about freshman chemistry now, nothing advanced, but he was known for his clarity and for his ability to convey the ideas to the students and keep them awake.

10:29.298 --> 10:32.442
Since almost every faculty member had a nickname, did he have one?

10:33.215 --> 10:34.476
Not that I know of.

10:35.297 --> 10:36.118
I haven't heard it either.

10:36.138 --> 10:36.819
Not that I know of.

10:38.300 --> 10:42.084
But I've heard many people speak of him as a fine teacher.

10:42.345 --> 10:42.885
He was.

10:43.486 --> 10:44.827
And a thoroughgoing gentleman.

10:44.927 --> 10:48.911
Very, very polite, very affable and friendly.

10:49.272 --> 10:50.093
Easy to get along with.

10:50.193 --> 10:52.495
Was he yet an administrator of any sort?

10:52.515 --> 10:55.919
No, but he became one that September.

10:55.999 --> 10:57.180
He was selected.

10:57.548 --> 11:24.771
to be the de facto dean at brian field now the decision has been made by the then board of directors to separate the incoming freshmen from the extant upperclassmen and to do that for four years consecutively to break up the hazing and this is the fall of 40 46. so they occupied on i don't know what kind of agreement with the army army air

11:25.358 --> 11:54.235
uh... by this time the air force i was still part of the army one forty six but in at any rate the students were housed in barracks out there and the uh... some of the buildings have been converted to lecture and laboratory space and uh... crude but adequate for the purpose and uh... i was assigned to teach out there and the they had converted part of the old hospital to uh... deficiency apartments and and it was uh...

11:54.552 --> 12:00.418
It was really a startling thing to see what your apartment might consist of.

12:00.498 --> 12:04.662
You might have a lot of space, but it wasn't always very convenient.

12:05.182 --> 12:15.252
But anyhow, it was adequate, and we lived out there, and for the graduate courses I took, I commuted into the campus.

12:15.372 --> 12:23.040
Now, how did you and your new wife, where did you acquire the furnishings?

12:24.168 --> 12:33.542
We just accumulated them somewhere, what we now call garage sales, and families would give us things.

12:33.662 --> 12:41.733
And it seems to me that maybe, it may be that the apartments out there had a stove and a refrigerator, but I'm not sure.

12:41.793 --> 12:43.716
We may have had to furnish that ourselves, too.

12:44.658 --> 12:47.662
What was your compensation that first year?

12:47.682 --> 12:48.403
Do you remember?

12:49.092 --> 12:51.095
I don't know, but I can look it up for you in a few minutes.

12:51.575 --> 12:54.139
I think I have all my forms $500 from those days.

12:54.259 --> 12:58.605
It was probably on the order of $250, $300 a month, which is pretty good.

12:58.665 --> 13:03.972
And you thought at that time that your career goal was to be an academic?

13:03.992 --> 13:06.636
I was trying to see if that's what I wanted to do.

13:06.676 --> 13:09.279
It turned out I did like teaching.

13:09.379 --> 13:16.669
I did like the idea of doing research, and so I did this for a couple of years.

13:17.155 --> 13:23.543
And at that time, I realized that part-time graduate work was not the best way to go about it.

13:24.905 --> 13:34.117
And I met a young faculty member in what was then the Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, a brand new department formed in 1947.

13:34.258 --> 13:43.770
Dr. Barnard S. Schweigert, who was actually a couple of months younger than I was,

13:44.189 --> 13:56.729
had come here as an associate professor and I had begun doing some research with him while I was still teaching full-time.

13:57.951 --> 14:03.379
And then in the fall of 1948,

14:05.114 --> 14:06.035
Let me think just a minute.

14:06.055 --> 14:06.996
I can get my time.

14:07.056 --> 14:16.707
At any rate, he left, I guess, about the summer of 48, and Dr. Lyman offered me an assistantship, a research assistantship for the year 48, 49.

14:16.848 --> 14:17.428
In biochemistry.

14:18.269 --> 14:20.292
In biochemistry, so I could finish my degree.

14:21.373 --> 14:31.965
And so I worked with Dr. Lyman as his lab assistant, did my own research, published two papers in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.

14:32.873 --> 14:40.124
and graduated in the spring of 49 with a major in biochemistry and a minor in chemistry.

14:41.425 --> 14:53.964
And then I decided for sure that I was going for a PhD and sent out my application to the University of Wisconsin.

14:54.244 --> 14:59.792
Meanwhile, Dr. Carl Pearson, excuse me, Dr. Paul Pearson

15:00.717 --> 15:23.974
who was Dean of the Graduate School and also the head of biochemistry had recommended me at Berkeley and I got an offer of an assistantship at Berkeley and one at Wisconsin and for reasons I can't articulate particularly well I took the one at Wisconsin and

15:24.342 --> 15:39.355
I guess it's mostly because the man who offered me the assistantship was quite famous, was well-known, and I didn't balance the advantages of having a famous professor or of having a famous university.

15:40.676 --> 15:45.740
Although Wisconsin certainly is a fine university, no problem about that.

15:46.401 --> 15:53.387
Later, when winter set in in Wisconsin, I did regret my decision.

15:54.346 --> 16:03.438
Katie and I by this time had our first child, Steve, and we moved to Wisconsin and I took up graduate work.

16:03.478 --> 16:12.950
Interestingly enough, the landlord association was powerful enough there that they could prevent the university from building student housing.

16:13.011 --> 16:16.455
And for marriage student housing,

16:16.790 --> 16:32.402
the university of wisconsin took over the old badger munitions plant which was 33 miles north of madison so i rode a bus 33 miles to and from work each commuting 66 miles total each day but uh

16:33.040 --> 16:39.687
On the other hand, being out there, it was in the country, and it was pleasant for Katie and Steve.

16:40.207 --> 16:44.972
It was essentially farmland, and we had a garden.

16:45.553 --> 16:48.235
Incidentally, it's interesting to watch a garden.

16:49.156 --> 16:54.221
They don't have long to grow, so you go out and plant it, and the next day it's here, and the next day it's here.

16:54.281 --> 17:00.027
And I then...

17:00.614 --> 17:16.108
After two years up there, my professor accepted an offer from the University of Texas at Austin, and I had to decide if I was going to start my research over under one of the Wisconsin faculty members or if I was going to accompany him to Austin.

17:17.860 --> 17:47.125
I decided I'd go to Austin with him because arrangements were made between Dr. Roger Williams, head of Biochemical Institute at Austin, and Dr. Elvium, who was head of biochemistry and also dean of the graduate school at Madison, that Wisconsin would let several of us take our last year of residence at Austin and give us full credit for it, and Dr. Williams very generously agreed to give us assistantships at UT.

17:47.847 --> 17:54.974
So also it was, my father was in wretched health at this time so it was a help to my mother for me to be 30 miles away.

17:56.195 --> 17:59.798
So we moved to Austin and I finished my work there in another year.

18:00.980 --> 18:05.364
Went back to Madison and defended my dissertation and graduated.

18:05.664 --> 18:07.406
So in that year you graduated?

18:07.466 --> 18:07.586
1952.

18:07.606 --> 18:08.347
1952.

18:09.408 --> 18:15.053
I graduated in the summer of 1952, August of 52.

18:15.353 --> 18:18.040
What was it like to get a first job in that era?

18:18.060 --> 18:28.566
Well, I had, actually I had two offers, and they were both academic.

18:28.586 --> 18:31.995
I decided that I probably wanted to do academic work instead of

18:32.431 --> 18:41.101
Instead of industrial, I enjoyed the research, but in academic research, I could choose what I wanted to do.

18:41.182 --> 18:42.523
In industrial research, I couldn't.

18:44.486 --> 18:48.951
I was offered a job at Michigan State as an assistant professor.

18:49.271 --> 18:56.480
Dr. Lawrence Quill was head of the chemistry department, and at that time, biochemistry at Michigan State was in the chemistry department.

18:57.281 --> 19:00.565
And I got a letter from Dr. Quill

19:01.085 --> 19:02.877
I gave a seminar up there one day.

19:03.329 --> 19:14.140
at their invitation and got a letter subsequently saying the full and associate professors voted unanimously to offer you the vacant position of assistant professor of biochemistry.

19:14.821 --> 19:21.367
And that was quite a temptation because it was a good department and Michigan State was at that time much better recognized than A&M.

19:21.768 --> 19:23.530
And it was going fast.

19:23.590 --> 19:24.811
And going fast.

19:24.831 --> 19:31.918
And so Dr. Lyman then offered me a position back here in my old department where I'd taken my master's degree.

19:32.472 --> 19:36.136
And Harry Kunkel and I had been graduate students here together.

19:36.737 --> 19:42.624
Then he had been an instructor and postdoc at Madison when I was still a graduate student there.

19:42.644 --> 19:55.358
So Harry and I crossed trails a couple of times, knew and liked each other, and he was a large part of persuading, I think, of persuading Dr. Lyman to offer me the job and persuading me to come.

19:56.367 --> 20:05.880
I appeared here in September of 52, and my salary, you'll want to know, was $5,000 for 12 months.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.623
For 12 months?

20:07.663 --> 20:08.544
For 12 months.

20:08.564 --> 20:14.272
Were you a full, did they then have Experiment Station Extension Service appointment?

20:14.412 --> 20:24.366
I was, they had started that in 47, I believe, and I was three-quarter time Experiment Station, one-quarter time college, as it was then.

20:25.510 --> 20:30.878
and biochemistry was over in agriculture.

20:31.259 --> 20:34.283
Biochemistry was and still is in agriculture.

20:34.904 --> 20:37.428
Our department was not physically together.

20:37.729 --> 20:42.876
Dr. Lyman, Dr. J.R.

20:42.937 --> 20:50.488
Couch, I believe Dr. Herman Schlink was still here at the time.

20:51.228 --> 20:53.472
All of them had space in the animal industry building.

20:53.712 --> 20:59.802
Dr. Couch on first floor and Dr. Lyman and Dr. Schlenk and Harry Kunkel on fourth floor.

21:00.162 --> 21:02.907
And I was given one half of a lab bench on the fourth floor.

21:03.748 --> 21:11.380
Dr. Richardson was on the old experiment station building, the old red building, as was Dr. Reiser.

21:15.460 --> 21:26.836
And when Dr. Lyman became department head, he shortly thereafter vacated the space he had in the field lab, which was a house, a converted residence out on the experiment station farm.

21:27.717 --> 21:31.682
And later that was taken over by Dr. Reiser, who continued there for many years.

21:32.023 --> 21:32.764
That's Dr. Raymond Reiser.

21:32.804 --> 21:33.685
Dr. Raymond Reiser.

21:33.825 --> 21:38.231
And we, so our department was spread out in five different places.

21:38.912 --> 21:40.354
What were the...

21:40.604 --> 21:47.475
topical areas of emphasis then in biochemistry, the research areas?

21:47.735 --> 21:50.620
Very largely nutritional biochemistry.

21:50.640 --> 22:01.937
It was what I would call the last of the really intensive work in nutritional biochemistry and doctors

22:03.301 --> 22:27.537
riser and couch became particularly well known in their in their particular riser and lipid nutrition and metabolism couch in um... poultry nutrition and applications thereof uh... richardson also did extremely good work in in this field doctor lyman was in and out of that as well as uh...

22:27.618 --> 22:30.681
old microbial metabolism and some things.

22:30.721 --> 22:41.633
I worked very, at the very start I worked in microbial metabolism pathways and then later shifted my emphasis to enzyme systems.

22:43.495 --> 22:47.640
As you began, what funding was made available to you?

22:47.660 --> 22:54.047
The first funding I had was from the experiment station and it was called feed control funds and it was funds

22:54.871 --> 23:05.505
I think the feed control service, I know they collected funds for the analysis and certification of feeds and then

23:05.941 --> 23:08.284
That was made available to the director of the station.

23:08.344 --> 23:10.527
He allocated it out for research projects.

23:10.547 --> 23:13.370
You had to write a project proposal and send it in.

23:14.311 --> 23:16.514
And then later I had hatch money.

23:17.576 --> 23:30.992
And then, of course, I was also given a hunting license to go out to National Institutes of Health or anyone that, any granting agency of that type that I wanted to.

23:31.553 --> 23:34.817
Looking back on it, how would you describe the

23:35.101 --> 23:44.959
way in which you as a newcomer was received by your colleagues and others?

23:44.979 --> 23:46.102
I hadn't really thought about it.

23:46.302 --> 23:49.268
Of course, they had all known me as a student.

23:49.348 --> 23:50.089
In fact,

23:50.997 --> 23:52.559
Dr. L.R.

23:52.579 --> 23:54.922
Richardson, Dr. Lyman had been on my committee.

23:55.202 --> 23:57.625
I can't remember who was on from chemistry right now.

23:59.467 --> 24:11.482
I'd known Dr. Reiser not well, but I was certainly not celebrated, but on the other hand, I wasn't put down in any way.

24:11.682 --> 24:15.587
You felt you were accepted from day one as a colleague?

24:16.276 --> 24:19.569
You were not treated like a... As a junior colleague, I would say, yes.

24:19.589 --> 24:21.396
But you were not treated like you were a student.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.098
No, no.

24:22.861 --> 24:25.712
And it's because I'd been away to get my terminal degree.

24:26.266 --> 24:31.615
And let's see, by 52, most of the veteran students were gone.

24:31.995 --> 24:32.496
Pretty much.

24:32.917 --> 24:38.265
So you're dealing with students just out of high school and so forth.

24:38.285 --> 24:38.526
Right.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.731
What were your teaching responsibilities in those early years?

24:41.751 --> 24:51.987
Dr. Lyman greeted me on the first day with the request that I take over the first graduate course and its laboratory, which is offered fall only.

24:52.507 --> 25:06.744
and it really kept me busy because fortunately I'd just been through all this in my own PhD work but I had to assemble the notes and work out the experiments.

25:06.844 --> 25:15.875
I probably used pretty much the experiments that he and Dr. Couch and Dr. Pearson had used for several years before me.

25:16.456 --> 25:21.822
Gradually I worked my own experiments into the laboratory and

25:24.451 --> 25:35.252
I had had an extremely good laboratory course at Wisconsin, and I found out one thing about laboratories at Wisconsin, they really meant business.

25:36.274 --> 25:41.324
And if you were assigned to do 15 experiments in a semester, 14 would not do.

25:43.307 --> 25:46.273
If you wanted to pass the course, you had to do 15.

25:46.523 --> 25:53.274
And this was pretty well acquired for all entering graduate biochemistry?

25:53.294 --> 25:54.516
For all biochemistry students.

25:54.576 --> 25:57.862
And then a lot of the students who took it came from outside.

25:57.942 --> 26:01.147
They might be, Plant Science has sent us a lot of students.

26:01.207 --> 26:05.695
And you know, of course, that that department has changed names several times.

26:05.755 --> 26:08.359
It used to be Plant Physiology and Pathology.

26:08.379 --> 26:09.361
There's Plant Science.

26:10.222 --> 26:12.987
Now I think it's Plant Pathology again.

26:13.507 --> 26:19.072
At any rate, well, for example, Paige Morgan was one of my early students in the course.

26:19.092 --> 26:24.898
And then also there would be quite a few of the veterinary pathology students would be in there.

26:25.759 --> 26:28.542
And, oh, quite a few others.

26:28.562 --> 26:28.982
Let's see.

26:30.283 --> 26:32.385
One thing, I've kept all my old grade books.

26:33.046 --> 26:36.590
I simply can't, I cannot throw away the old grade books.

26:36.650 --> 26:43.176
And one of the hardest discarding I did was when I gave up my laboratory and retired 11 years ago.

26:43.493 --> 26:46.897
I threw all of my students' data books in the dumpster.

26:48.119 --> 26:48.759
That was a wrench.

26:48.940 --> 26:49.801
I can understand that.

26:52.504 --> 26:54.126
But the data had been published.

26:54.166 --> 26:59.152
I mean, it was... Describe, in general, describe those students.

26:59.552 --> 27:00.393
What were they like?

27:00.513 --> 27:01.875
What were their motivations?

27:04.138 --> 27:08.843
They were... Many of them were war veterans.

27:08.863 --> 27:10.105
And, of course, they're all male.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.206
All male.

27:12.167 --> 27:12.808
And...

27:13.970 --> 27:20.924
They were, in general, polite and industrious.

27:21.966 --> 27:23.089
They wanted to succeed.

27:23.630 --> 27:26.275
Were most of them Southwesterners?

27:26.390 --> 27:27.292
Most of them were.

27:28.253 --> 27:33.663
Occasionally there'd be somebody from far away like Indiana or New York.

27:34.524 --> 27:35.826
Masters and doctors.

27:35.847 --> 27:36.788
Masters and doctors.

27:37.129 --> 27:40.435
About how many doctoral degrees did the department produce then per year?

27:41.276 --> 27:41.877
I don't know.

27:42.057 --> 27:45.764
And its first year of Ph.D.

27:46.525 --> 27:51.013
granting was in 1950.

27:52.968 --> 27:56.677
Orlando Ochesi and Don Hood received the first two degrees.

27:57.500 --> 28:09.390
We had an observation of the 50th anniversary of the department in 1997, and Ochesi, who had a very distinguished career in Peru, as you know,

28:09.370 --> 28:12.294
He was, what, he was rector of the university.

28:12.314 --> 28:14.096
Wasn't he minister of agriculture too?

28:14.116 --> 28:14.537
I think so.

28:15.237 --> 28:19.423
And Don Hood, who had quite a distinguished career in oceanographic research.

28:19.463 --> 28:25.070
Don moved from biochemistry to oceanography, biological oceanography, chemical oceanography.

28:25.090 --> 28:25.951
I'll get it right in a minute.

28:26.992 --> 28:36.644
And retired from the departmentship head in Alaska, or he may have been dean, I don't recall, but he moved halfway home.

28:36.684 --> 28:37.926
He moved to Washington.

28:38.497 --> 28:48.512
After this first year, what was your, as you thought of it, what was your first important step of achievement?

28:52.599 --> 28:57.166
To get some research going, get some manuscripts accepted, and get a grant.

28:57.406 --> 28:58.327
How long did that take?

28:58.988 --> 29:01.332
Oh, let's see.

29:05.648 --> 29:24.282
I probably got a paper out the next, well I still of course had some residual work with my research advisor and I think that I trailed off a couple of papers with him after I came over here and then it must have been

29:24.818 --> 29:34.070
Uh, 53 or 54 that I got some manuscripts accepted, and I don't remember when I got a grant, first got a grant, but... And where was the first big grant from?

29:34.090 --> 29:42.521
Well, I didn't have any big grants in those days, but if you hoarded your money, you could... Oh, gosh, I don't remember that.

29:42.721 --> 29:45.865
Either the National Institutes of Health or...

29:47.296 --> 29:48.398
Office of Naval Research.

29:49.339 --> 29:57.471
Were you given any advice as to how much of grant money would be expected gradually to?

29:58.192 --> 30:00.356
No, that really wasn't done in those days.

30:00.416 --> 30:03.500
I'm sure it may be done now, but it wasn't at all done in those days.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.224
They just expected you to figure it out.

30:06.244 --> 30:08.568
Neither was I given any advice on how to go about it.

30:10.110 --> 30:16.780
And I'm also implicating my former, my PhD advisor who didn't give you any kind of clues on

30:17.333 --> 30:18.895
on how to run a program or fund it.

30:19.697 --> 30:26.988
In those early years, if you needed advice about the way things were done at A&M, who did you turn to?

30:27.028 --> 30:30.072
Usually Dr. Carl Lyman, my department head.

30:30.152 --> 30:31.695
He was a level-headed guy.

30:33.057 --> 30:34.960
Describe his style of leadership.

30:40.068 --> 30:42.611
Minimal control.

30:43.753 --> 30:44.995
He was very

30:46.645 --> 31:02.258
very relaxed um well not in not in a sense i mean he was a hard he was a hard worker but his administrative style was pretty pretty relaxed we used to laugh he kept a whole lot of file folders of manila folders

31:02.626 --> 31:07.796
And you could go in and say, Dr. Lyman, I'd like to talk to you about getting an analytical ultracentrifuge.

31:08.217 --> 31:11.745
And he'd take a sheet of paper, and he'd write analytical ultracentrifuge.

31:11.845 --> 31:16.354
And you'd finish your discussion, and he'd slide it in one of those, in one of those manila folders.

31:16.735 --> 31:21.184
And you'd notice that he hadn't written down any suggestions or anything else.

31:21.204 --> 31:23.248
He'd just put the topic down there.

31:23.268 --> 31:24.330
But he was...

31:29.592 --> 31:36.422
Oh, I would say pretty much hands-off, and particularly with respect to the faculty members.

31:36.562 --> 31:50.402
In fact, at one time we were, somebody referred to us as the Six Kingdoms or the Seven Kingdoms or something like that because he expected each faculty member to operate his own program.
