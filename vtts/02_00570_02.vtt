00:03.035 --> 00:15.367
Could we talk a little bit about around 1971, the 
mechanics involved, what the government did to

00:03.035 --> 00:15.367
combine the lines when Amtrak came out into 
existence? Yes. When Amtrak came into existence,

00:17.069 --> 00:26.238
the government legislation was prepared to 
create them. The railroads that had passenger

00:26.638 --> 00:31.843
trains running, had the option of either 
continuing to run them themselves and suffer

00:32.093 --> 00:44.065
whatever losses or consequences they wanted to 
suffer, or join Amtrak. And Amtrak then would

00:44.565 --> 00:55.236
contract with them to operate the trains. And they 
were taking over equipment was rapidly reaching

00:59.448 --> 01:05.076
the end of its useful lifetime. And to give you an 
example of some of the equipment problems they had

01:05.096 --> 01:20.258
when this came about, most all the railroads 
joined Amtrak because they wanted to get out of

01:05.096 --> 01:20.258
this money losing mess that they were in. Only the 
Southern and the Rio Grande and the, I don't know,

01:21.115 --> 01:28.946
the three maybe that go to Florida. I can't tell you 
which ones they were, but the Southern Crescent

01:28.966 --> 01:37.398
remained the Southern's Crescent, and they ran 
that passenger train and did not join any of that.

01:37.418 --> 01:42.145
They have now joined the Rio Grande. got a 
passenger train that they ran, and now it's into

01:42.833 --> 01:51.463
the Anchorage area. I don't think it's Rock 
Island. There were three, I think, all the way from

01:52.665 --> 01:57.470
here. They did this, and all of a sudden,

01:57.490 --> 02:10.866
on

01:57.490 --> 02:10.866
the Texas Chief, and then was renamed the Lone 
Star, We had Santa Fe Concess trains that came in

02:11.605 --> 02:24.948
here, all the cars matched, all of them had the same 
kind of air conditioning, for example, and our

02:11.605 --> 02:24.948
low-level cars, they were all steam-actuated air 
conditioners. Now, the person that maintained

02:24.968 --> 02:34.103
those cars at night, when the train came in and 
checked out everything, knew that air

02:24.968 --> 02:34.103
conditioning system very well. The high-level 
cars that the Santa Fe ran were a different air

02:35.281 --> 02:41.248
conditioning system, but again, they were all 
alike. So there were two air conditioning

02:41.268 --> 02:46.454
systems, one for the high-level and one for the 
low-level. That's all they had to contend with,

02:46.474 --> 02:53.242
and they had spare parts and all that sort of stuff. 
All of a sudden, you had trains coming in with cars

02:53.262 --> 03:00.911
on them from all kinds of railroad lines. And I 
remember one night, the Lone Star came in, And it

03:04.660 --> 03:12.848
had

03:04.660 --> 03:12.848
a Waukesha Pierce air conditioner that was out on 
one car. But then steam-activated Santa Fe was out

03:12.948 --> 03:17.333
on another car. And this was in the summertime. And 
they had a mechanical air conditioning deal that

03:19.515 --> 03:25.942
was out on a third one. Three different kinds of air 
conditioners. And no parts stopped. It was a

03:30.847 --> 03:32.068
disaster. One of the things that has come about in 
Amtrak that has really revolutionized this thing

03:34.225 --> 03:54.782
and really been a turnaround as far as equipment is 
concerned is that Charlie Luna, who is on the board

03:34.225 --> 03:54.782
of directors of Amtrak and is a tech scientist from 
Dallas, Florida, conceived the idea that we

03:34.225 --> 03:54.782
should convert All of the older equipment is still 
good enough to operate. They should convert it all

04:01.061 --> 04:08.312
to what he calls head-in power. So no matter what 
kind of air conditioning system is on this car,

04:08.332 --> 04:19.408
it's going to be removed and it's going to be 
replaced with electrical heat and air

04:08.332 --> 04:19.408
conditioning. Electricity provided by a big 640 
volt generator in the engine. So you have to train

04:20.710 --> 04:25.377
line this electricity back, 640 volt electricity 
back. That, of course, costs a lot of money for a car

04:26.167 --> 04:29.952
to convert. But it gives you something that works. 
And standardized and works. And there's this plan

04:37.121 --> 04:51.338
and they've done that now so that all the heritage 
equipment, ones that are inherited from the

04:37.121 --> 04:51.338
railroads, have all been converted to head-end 
power, every one of them. And all the steam,

04:51.458 --> 04:54.402
activated air conditioning, steam heating is all 
gone. So it's, and all the new equipment that's

04:54.820 --> 05:07.789
heading down, all the new super liners that they 
produce, the high-level cars, have you been on

04:54.820 --> 05:07.789
them? Have you been here? Oh, yeah, they're really 
great. And they're out of the way expensive, you

05:08.852 --> 05:11.698
know. The

05:12.100 --> 05:34.783
sleeping accommodations up in the

05:12.100 --> 05:34.783
top are just for something like $20, $25 a night, 
more than it takes to get there. And, you know, it's

05:34.803 --> 05:35.524
not killing you. It's not a price that will drive 
you home. The Amtrak essentially is... Re-built.

05:37.186 --> 05:37.686
They re-built everything. They've either got 
brand new... Now,

05:38.662 --> 06:03.651
over on the east coast, they have to run . They won't 
have .

06:07.957 --> 06:24.919
one

06:07.957 --> 06:24.919
of the things that

06:25.743 --> 06:48.758
the power that Superlion cars have in contrast to 
the last few years is one of the things that we need

06:25.743 --> 06:48.758
to look at. And they've got an available dispute 
and a trial that's been going on for about two

06:48.778 --> 06:50.581
years. And it's pretty clean to believe that 
Superlion is going on for a long time. And in the

06:52.143 --> 06:53.185
meantime, things are just going downhill. a

06:53.654 --> 07:13.823
lot

06:53.654 --> 07:13.823
of a lot of what happened .

07:44.087 --> 07:44.107
. . so

07:44.667 --> 07:50.847
much You

07:51.265 --> 08:16.658
said that you're interested in Midwestern 
swimming and Chinese swimming. When did that come

08:16.678 --> 08:17.179
about? Yeah, when I started that way, you know, 
this isn't the only good thing about it. It's about

08:18.841 --> 08:19.602
feeling real good about it. Have

08:19.987 --> 08:31.269
y'all

08:19.987 --> 08:31.269
had problems getting the private part to be pulled 
by one side? Oh, you've got to tell your daddy on

08:31.289 --> 08:32.832
that, so he can go through both on both. I

08:33.335 --> 09:03.055
don't know how I'm going to call it. One

09:03.440 --> 09:08.134
other thing that I think is very important. I

09:08.857 --> 09:30.199
was at one time on the board of directors. And that 
was the first time I was on the board of directors

09:30.219 --> 09:31.580
meeting. We were the only job in Canada that served 
people providing the end vaccine that they were

09:31.600 --> 09:33.782
contracted to run. And we got a reporting of more 
than one increase of the capacity in New Orleans.

09:35.384 --> 09:56.409
They

09:35.384 --> 09:56.409
were dispatching a local freighter. And I'm sure 
you all can think of it right. He dispatched a local

09:57.310 --> 09:58.571
freighter towards San Quentin in the U.S. So that 
means that San Quentin would be walking around and

09:58.591 --> 10:01.094
cutting out stuff and leaving it on the side and 
putting stuff up. Working all the way to the end of

10:01.114 --> 10:02.356
the day at the perfect time. Then he dispatched a 
few more freighters at two feet which was blocked

10:05.000 --> 10:08.831
by the locusts. So even that was rancid. Then he 
dispatched his insects to harm the people. Then

10:15.732 --> 10:32.317
the sunset limited that night to something like 
nine and a half hours late getting to Houston. Can

10:32.337 --> 10:33.418
you imagine why it was nine and a half hours late? 
Well, that was the kind of evidence that was

10:33.438 --> 10:35.361
presented to the federal chief by the 
presentation. and

10:36.961 --> 10:59.712
instead of being We've

11:00.367 --> 11:19.754
been having performances that were 30% on time, 
and they balled it into the ladies and stuff like

11:00.367 --> 11:19.754
that. Just overnight. Just overnight. There was 
one big lawsuit. So sometimes I think that's who

11:20.956 --> 11:21.757
you are. You've just got to see somebody in order to 
get to the point. and

11:23.300 --> 11:47.108
the passenger writing letters to some of these and 
all that. It's probably been some other format. In

11:47.889 --> 11:50.893
order to change anything, I don't know, Marvel 
realizes that it is an impact of a political act

11:47.889 --> 11:50.893
that does exactly what the Congress tells it to do. 
Dr.

11:51.498 --> 12:18.956
Matney, I appreciate you taking the time to look 
over my outline and for giving me this interview

11:51.498 --> 12:18.956
this morning. Thank you.
