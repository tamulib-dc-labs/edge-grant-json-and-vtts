00:02.326 --> 00:06.911
General, Brigadier General Johnson, today is 
July 14, 1981. Let's start about, start talking

00:07.812 --> 00:10.795
about your upbringing. Can you tell us where, 
where and when you were born? Yeah, I was born in

00:14.258 --> 00:19.224
Houston, Texas, May the 2nd, 1921. Okay, can you 
tell me about your parents, their occupations or

00:20.145 --> 00:24.069
backgrounds?

00:27.192 --> 00:28.333
Well, my dad, uh, At the time that I was born, I

00:30.001 --> 00:40.894
was working for the city of Houston as a health 
officer. However, he had been a machinist in the

00:40.914 --> 00:49.805
Southern Pacific Roundhouse in Houston. At the 
time, one of Houston's most popular Mayor Oscar

00:55.718 --> 01:09.752
Holcomb ran for office the first time, and dad 
helped carry the roundhouse, which was a

00:55.718 --> 01:09.752
considerable vote. And as such, the mayor carried 
him over to the city, and dad worked for the city off

01:09.772 --> 01:24.747
and on while Holcomb was mayor and under a couple of 
other mayors. My mother is a pretty well-educated

01:25.705 --> 01:44.265
lady, and

01:25.705 --> 01:44.265
though she was principally a housewife and 
mother,

01:25.705 --> 01:44.265
she did substitute school teaching. I have one 
brother. He's four years younger than I, and he too

01:46.407 --> 01:52.253
is a graduate of Texas A&M. What type of education 
did your father have? My father had only a high

01:56.184 --> 02:00.729
school education. He was a enlisted man in World 
War I. Got all the way to the rank of corporal.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.604
We lived in a middle class neighborhood.

02:16.567 --> 02:20.772
I went to private school through the second or 
third grade and then entered public school. As

02:26.759 --> 02:36.835
such, I guess it was a year ahead

02:26.759 --> 02:36.835
of in school of most children my age.

02:40.781 --> 02:51.096
So much so that I was 16 years old in May and I entered 
A&M. At 16? At 16, yes.

02:56.193 --> 03:03.760
Which incidentally, I was the second youngest in 
our class.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.941
Come to bear later on. Did your mother go to 
college? She went to college, but did not

03:08.545 --> 03:11.087
graduate. Do you remember where she went? No, I 
don't. Coincidentally, she and I went to the same

03:14.351 --> 03:18.355
high school in Houston, Texas. Same building, 
same location. What type of student were you in

03:21.586 --> 03:25.414
high school? In high school, I was probably a good 
student. Nowhere making all A's or anything like

03:31.807 --> 03:34.552
that. Strong

03:36.737 --> 03:42.649
enough that The only courses that gave me any 
trouble were Spanish. At that time, Spanish was a

03:46.029 --> 03:49.492
two-year requirement. I remember having to 
repeat one semester of Spanish.

03:58.540 --> 04:09.350
I had strength enough to be company commander of a 
junior ROTC unit at the high school. We had three

04:09.370 --> 04:12.973
companies, so we had our own battalion. I was one of 
the three company commanders. So you became

04:15.477 --> 04:18.301
involved in the military early then in life. Yes, 
yes. I knew from real early in life that the two

04:20.243 --> 04:31.276
things that I was interested in doing, that was 
building and being in the military. Why did you

04:31.336 --> 04:32.157
know that? How could you tell? Well,

04:33.819 --> 04:41.188
as...

04:43.683 --> 05:01.431
Looking back,

04:43.683 --> 05:01.431
we had an ideal, what you might call, miniature 
battlefield between our garage and the garage

04:43.683 --> 05:01.431
next door to us. Incidentally, I was born in my 
house that I lived in, not in

05:01.451 --> 05:08.583
a hospital. We had just a large space. We were 
constantly using miniature soldiers and tanks

05:11.847 --> 05:22.496
and things like that and playing war games. And I 
was always the one that was doing the building and

05:22.516 --> 05:34.167
the excavation

05:22.516 --> 05:34.167
and laying supposedly the mine fields and things 
like that. And that's just not something that we do

05:34.187 --> 05:40.352
every now and then. all but just a constant game. 
And when the day was over, we would quietly leave

05:42.390 --> 05:49.380
everything where it was and just take a little 
break. And this was one of our favorite pastimes as

05:49.400 --> 05:55.128
we were growing up.

05:56.831 --> 06:09.850
I was always stringing off things,

05:56.831 --> 06:09.850
getting things ready in our own imagination to be 
built and things like that. I didn't call it an

06:11.247 --> 06:26.968
argument or a flash or anything like that with my 
father because he had grandiose ideas that I was

06:11.247 --> 06:26.968
going to be a patrol engineer and I knew damn good I 
was going to be a civil engineer. Sooner or later, I

06:26.988 --> 06:40.866
guess I won out, but it cost maybe

06:26.988 --> 06:40.866
a couple of years of career or something like that, 
having to do the things that he wanted me to do. Was

06:42.719 --> 06:44.741
he ever involved in the military? Oh, you said he 
was during the World War. Just during the World

06:46.542 --> 06:47.403
War. But did he remain in the reserves or anything 
like that? No. So he didn't come from a military

06:50.626 --> 06:57.632
background, yet you knew at an early age that you 
wanted to be in the military. How can you explain

06:57.972 --> 06:58.933
that? I don't know, because I even had employment 
to West Point and couldn't pass physical for West

06:59.554 --> 07:11.224
Point, so... I chose other

07:11.592 --> 07:17.779
routes of getting to where I got.

07:21.122 --> 07:23.125
There was a program. It's called the Citizens 
Military Training Camps. I don't know whether

07:28.851 --> 07:40.063
you've ever been exposed to them or not, but which 
right here in San Antonio in Camp Bullitt. out

07:40.887 --> 07:43.490
north of town here. It's one of the locations that 
young men from all over this part of the country

07:43.730 --> 07:54.260
would come each summer and train and study. And it 
was a four-year process called the basic red,

07:54.320 --> 08:00.647
white, and blue. And after the four years and the 
completion of what was known as the 10 series

08:00.667 --> 08:10.877
course, by correspondence, he would then be 
commissioned as second lieutenant.

08:17.722 --> 08:40.307
The three years of ROTC in high school could be 
substituted for the basic, and I finished the red

08:17.722 --> 08:40.307
course and the white course and was prepared to go 
back to the blue, but I attained a contract for

08:17.722 --> 08:40.307
advanced military training at A&M There was no 
requirement to go back to next year, but I could go

08:40.844 --> 08:55.743
back any time, so I kind of figured I'll take the 
contract through Senior ROTC and head the

08:40.844 --> 08:55.743
commission that way. But I made up my mind I was 
going to be a commission officer. outstanding

09:05.127 --> 09:17.399
Captain of the Artillery Commandant when I was in 
high school that took a personal interest in his

09:05.127 --> 09:17.399
cadet officers. What was his name? His name was 
Paul Van Tuyl, V-A-N-T-U-Y-L.

09:32.043 --> 09:45.889
He was a second father to each of the cadet 
officers, and we could turn to him for counseling,

09:32.043 --> 09:45.889
anything, anything about life that we wanted to 
talk about. I'm sure that he had an effect. Let's

09:50.136 --> 09:52.781
get back to your parents for a minute. What type 
of... character with your father and your mother

09:56.140 --> 10:22.722
my father and mother are still living and he is a 
character

09:56.140 --> 10:22.722
my father was the first born generation of danish 
stock the johnson comes from denmark my

09:56.140 --> 10:22.722
grandfather came from denmark when he was 17 years 
old

10:23.697 --> 10:26.801
Where and how he met my grandmother, I don't know. 
Who was Otis, O-T-I-S? She was a third generation

10:30.885 --> 10:36.532
away from James Otis, the revolutionary writer. 
No kidding. Yes. That's where the O comes from,

10:38.735 --> 10:43.320
Otis in my name. They came down after he entered the 
country in New England. They came down to East

10:47.785 --> 10:53.552
Texas, and Grandpa went into the lumber business. 
My dad had

10:54.798 --> 11:06.013
three

10:54.798 --> 11:06.013
brothers and one sister. They lived in the 
Groveton Huntsville area and did lumber over

11:06.033 --> 11:19.472
there in the Piney Woods.

11:24.278 --> 11:43.161
He, I don't guess he and I are too much different, 
because there is truth in the saying, a part head

11:24.278 --> 11:43.161
gains, because when he gets pretty well set in his 
ways, he's kind of difficult. He has

11:43.181 --> 11:50.370
done all that he could with

11:53.017 --> 12:02.870
Everything that he had to work with to raise the 
family and provide us with a good life. So he was a

12:02.890 --> 12:04.593
hard working guy? Oh yes, very. The fact is, even to 
this day, he's now a hybridizer of Hemerichalis.

12:16.929 --> 12:19.873
That's a daylily hybridizer. He actually breeds 
them, names them. grows them professionally, and

12:22.480 --> 12:28.607
works the garden himself. Not in the best of 
physical conditions, but that's his life. When he

12:35.536 --> 12:42.404
gets into something, he's into it all the way.

12:42.424 --> 12:46.189
Looking back, we all know that Jerry made 
mistakes. He made two races, two attempts. to

12:52.501 --> 13:00.352
become state railroad

12:52.501 --> 13:00.352
commissioner. At the time, my brother and I were 
young. There was no way that we could, and probably

13:06.921 --> 13:16.635
didn't even realize it at the time, but looking 
back, he didn't have the qualifications to become

13:06.921 --> 13:16.635
state railroad commissioner. But he thought he 
did, and it cost a hell of a lot of money to become

13:16.655 --> 13:19.719
state commissioner. And that probably set us back 
financially, My brother's living comfortably,

13:22.825 --> 13:31.136
and my mother and father are living comfortably. I 
guess we've made it through. I want to stop here.

13:37.945 --> 13:41.210
Okay, now can you sort of characterize your 
mother?

13:47.458 --> 13:49.761
Yeah, my mother, I'd have to say, is the

13:52.762 --> 13:59.593
is really the strength in the center of the family. 
She's the one that has probably

13:59.633 --> 14:17.942
done more for both my brother and me, has

13:59.633 --> 14:17.942
been the point around which the family grew up. 
whenever there were real problems. Really, I

14:21.546 --> 14:28.653
guess Mother was the one that

14:21.546 --> 14:28.653
seemed to pull everything together. And

14:28.713 --> 14:39.864
my mother,

14:28.713 --> 14:39.864
well, I can't say that she alone. Both of them were 
quite active in Parent Teachers Association,

14:39.944 --> 14:47.912
both at my school and my brother's school. But in 
spite of the fact that we had no sisters, my mother

14:49.107 --> 15:03.204
became the volunteer head of the Girl Scouts in the 
Houston area. She was the top volunteer woman. She

15:08.030 --> 15:14.878
great in service, social work, and I'm sure that I 
picked that up from her rather than from my father.

15:19.197 --> 15:23.463
My father was a hard worker and a man always trying 
to make money. I don't mean greedy or selfish, but

15:23.483 --> 15:35.942
that was his, realizing his shortcomings, he was 
going to make it one way or the other.

15:36.242 --> 15:43.954
And again, as they both are growing old there, 
she's the She's the mainstay of the two of them. Who

15:47.211 --> 15:49.834
is the authority in the household now? Well, I 
don't think there is one right now. I'd say Mother

15:54.217 --> 15:56.559
was. Dad often thought he was, but I think Mother 
had trouble

15:58.181 --> 16:04.546
with him. Was religion an important influence? It 
was to a degree, and it's interesting that you

16:09.070 --> 16:14.515
bring it up because I don't know how well you know 
Houston, but

16:16.452 --> 16:30.674
there's some things that I don't know to precise 
dates and things like that. Their acquaintances

16:32.898 --> 16:38.747
and courtships took place

16:40.853 --> 16:46.160
in Bell County, which is in a little community 
called Holland. And I don't know what

16:46.741 --> 17:02.522
happened or how it moved from Holland to the 
Houston Heights, which is out on Heights

16:46.741 --> 17:02.522
Boulevard, Washington Avenue, out in that area. 
And yet, when I was born and We grew up, we lived all

17:08.174 --> 17:14.544
the way across town on the east side, out in 
Eastwood. But every Sunday, we'd go back to the

17:14.564 --> 17:20.173
Presbyterian Church out in the Heights. Well, 
this took place until, oh, about the time, I guess,

17:21.596 --> 17:32.393
I was in the fifth, sixth, or seventh grade, 
something like that. And all of the friends that I

17:38.725 --> 17:51.383
had there in our neighborhood were going to an 
Episcopal church that was just about two blocks

17:38.725 --> 17:51.383
from where we lived. And I guess I was the first one 
to balk. And I said, well, you all go on to the

17:55.229 --> 18:04.742
Heights, but I'm going to go over here where all of 
my friends are going to Sunday school and church.

18:06.308 --> 18:11.935
And

18:06.308 --> 18:11.935
didn't seem to have any problem. I was permitted to 
do it. And

18:15.399 --> 18:23.029
I was confirmed in the Episcopal Church. As a 
result of my going, my brother became confirmed in

18:24.851 --> 18:32.080
the Episcopal Church. My mother then switched 
over to the Episcopal Church. From what? From

18:37.880 --> 18:38.981
Presbyterian. Where they were all going out on a 
hike. And later my father did. My wife, when I

18:45.367 --> 18:47.329
married her, was Methodist. She's now Episcopal. 
My brother's first wife went to the Episcopal

18:49.891 --> 18:54.055
Church. I mean, joined the Episcopal Church. And 
so we just made a swing from the Presbyterian to the

18:57.138 --> 19:02.083
Episcopal Church. And yes, It played a great deal. 
I

19:04.888 --> 19:21.494
was,

19:04.888 --> 19:21.494
as I grew up, I was about, you have to compare me to a 
matchstick, all the way through school, even when

19:04.888 --> 19:21.494
I came out of A&M. When I came out of A&M, I was six 
foot two and a half. I weighed 139 pounds. And I was

19:27.404 --> 19:29.387
that way all the way through school. Well, in 
junior high school, I could play basketball. But

19:32.912 --> 19:39.001
when I reached high school, I was out of my league. 
But we had a preacher at this Episcopal church that

19:39.141 --> 19:47.414
made up his mind that he was going to draw the young 
people to the church. And he had all types of

19:48.336 --> 19:50.599
programs. And one of the programs was a sports 
program. We had basketball teams, and we had

19:53.777 --> 20:01.592
tackle football teams, and we had complete full 
uniforms and so on. The fact is, the worst football

20:01.612 --> 20:11.710
game that I ever played, playing for that church, 
and we were known as the Eastwood Green, was

20:01.612 --> 20:11.710
against the University of Houston. The church 
played the University of Houston. Now this was

20:14.947 --> 20:23.738
back when the University of Houston was a junior 
college in downtown Houston up on the second or

20:14.947 --> 20:23.738
third floor of a building before it became what it 
is now. But again, lightweight as I was, that guy on

20:24.900 --> 20:30.987
the other side was about 185 pounds. And it took two 
of us to move him every once in a while. But yes, both

20:34.872 --> 20:41.781
because of this... Gordon Reese was the 
preacher's name. Reverend Reese's interest in

20:46.099 --> 20:58.433
the youth and the programs that he had to attract us 
to the church, it was quite important. I have later

20:59.914 --> 21:04.900
in life, they come out, I served as a vesterman on 
the Bishop's Committee, what the Episcopal

21:05.673 --> 21:20.246
Church calls the committee that runs a mission 
that's not yet a full church. I've been a lay

21:20.266 --> 21:21.528
reader.

21:26.312 --> 21:27.353
It means an awful lot. I am a member of the Episcopal 
Church here in Winthrop.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.764
My dad and mother are still members. I don't know 
whether my brother

21:37.784 --> 21:41.910
is or not. You've had a successful career. In what 
way would you credit your parents for that?

21:59.917 --> 22:03.102
Well, I don't know. limited it to words.

22:14.268 --> 22:33.831
My father, as

22:14.268 --> 22:33.831
Bud and I were growing up, insisted that we realize 
that

22:14.268 --> 22:33.831
every man, and I use that collectively for Van 
Allen, every man is good. until the first time he

22:35.785 --> 22:37.467
does wrong. And then if he does you wrong the second 
time, that's your fault. And you've got to accept

22:45.820 --> 22:48.704
people on that basis. Everybody's good. The 
second time, it's your fault. And my mother taught

22:55.013 --> 23:02.164
us way back in the beginning

23:04.675 --> 23:12.246
If you ever decide that you're going to steal, 
steal real, real big. Don't steal little. Steal

23:13.588 --> 23:14.269
big. And I think that hit both my butt and me, and 
just, you know, every time temptation might come

23:16.953 --> 23:30.092
your way, you think, hey, I didn't think about it. 
And she explained it, but that was what she was

23:30.747 --> 23:37.558
trying to do. And my brother had had a very 
successful life. He had been assistant high

23:39.741 --> 23:48.334
school principal in Houston. In fact, he was 
assistant principal of the first high school that

23:48.354 --> 23:57.348
was integrated in Houston. He, too, is an Air 
Force.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.118
Reserve, retired colonel. He's waiting for aid 
before he can start growing benefits. He retired

24:06.585 --> 24:07.948
as a retired colonel. But he's a farmer for Potato 
Shrine in Houston, which is a very big job in the

24:08.569 --> 24:19.671
Messiah

24:08.569 --> 24:19.671
Corps.

24:34.113 --> 24:42.526
The associations that I've had with my parents, of 
course, began to be limited after I was 16 and went

24:34.113 --> 24:42.526
off to school. Because I was in that baby class at 
41. And though I was only 20 years old, they

24:47.293 --> 24:51.800
commissioned me, and pow, we were gone. And I did 
come back and got out of the service. I had five or

25:00.212 --> 25:03.377
six years. close association because we both 
lived in Houston and then piled back in the service

25:03.577 --> 25:10.266
and gone again. So I guess really anything that I 
received or from them came about in the first 16

25:10.286 --> 25:21.160
years of life. What kind of a student were you in 
high school? In high school? You said you were an

25:26.122 --> 25:32.510
average student, but were you better in the 
engineering or the math courses? Were those your

25:33.231 --> 25:35.074
favorite subjects? Well, in high school, math was 
my favorite subject.

25:43.004 --> 25:45.407
Physics.

25:48.051 --> 25:53.378
Any time that a course was based on pure memory, I'd 
have problems.

25:59.062 --> 26:03.227
I just found it very, very difficult to put courses 
to memory. Jumping even at college, for instance,

26:03.387 --> 26:13.919
I took the two semesters of freshman chemistry, 
five semesters before I managed to get by. Because

26:13.939 --> 26:21.909
I could find no way to take chemistry back to 
reading or math. I mean, it was either a memory

26:21.929 --> 26:25.693
course or it wasn't. Again, we're way out, way 
ahead. But when I pursued my master's degree and

26:28.506 --> 26:38.357
had to take a course in geology, I was back to a 
memory course. There was no way to take

26:38.377 --> 26:44.504
mathematics and tie it to any type of reasoning. It 
was just a plain old memory course. There I was at

26:49.310 --> 26:51.192
that time. I was a major. I think I managed to make a C 
out of Jolly.

27:04.103 --> 27:12.797
Were you interested in a number of organizations 
or any organizations during those years in high

27:04.103 --> 27:12.797
school? Yeah, I'd always, I've been since, well, 
back my age, you couldn't go into the Boy Scouts

27:19.218 --> 27:26.248
until 12 years old, and we didn't have such a thing 
as a cup. And I went into the Boy Scouts and got

27:26.268 --> 27:46.578
to be a Star Scout, I guess, before going

27:26.268 --> 27:46.578
off to

27:26.268 --> 27:46.578
college. But the managed to Stay busy and stay out 
of trouble by the program that they had at the

27:50.875 --> 27:59.225
church, the Boy Scout program. I sold papers on 
Saturday night. I didn't have a regular paper

28:05.733 --> 28:08.917
route.

28:10.579 --> 28:15.145
It's something that's not done anymore in the 
community. The Houston Post and the Houston

28:15.884 --> 28:19.709
Chronicle both were coming out on Sunday night. I 
mean, Saturday night. It's a Sunday paper. And

28:23.214 --> 28:28.521
we'd pedal the bikes up and down the streets and 
call in the paper and sell them. Then on Sunday

28:29.843 --> 28:39.196
mornings, I threw two freebie routes that I had to 
ride about six or eight miles from home to even

28:29.843 --> 28:39.196
start those routes. I mean, they were that far.

28:45.668 --> 28:47.871
No other particular organization. I didn't 
belong to the highway. I didn't belong to the Y. Did

28:51.656 --> 28:57.063
you consider yourself popular or well-liked in 
high school?

29:01.890 --> 29:04.293
Yes, I think so. Probably more so in high school 
than in elementary school. Where I went to school,

29:11.825 --> 29:25.564
we had the first five grades in elementary, and 
then six, seven, eight in junior high school, and

29:11.825 --> 29:25.564
then nine, ten, eleven in high school.

29:28.629 --> 29:41.106
And in the eighth grade,

29:28.629 --> 29:41.106
I started going with a girl, and we went with each 
other all the way through high school. end of my

29:41.373 --> 30:09.304
freshman year in college before we ever broke up 
and

29:41.373 --> 30:09.304
we were always in a small group of people but that 
small group would in turn be in larger groups but we

29:41.373 --> 30:09.304
had pretty much our own small group the fact is in 
high school there were four of us that called

29:41.373 --> 30:09.304
ourselves the 4-h's Harold, Hub, Morris, and then 
we had to really reach for the other one, and we

30:10.347 --> 30:17.136
reached for his last name, and it was Haberly. All 
four of us ended up going into the military.

30:25.627 --> 30:28.951
Harold Lewis is deceased now. He was in the Army.

30:36.160 --> 30:36.861
Haberly.

30:39.997 --> 30:45.825
Retired as a full colonel in the Marines and is 
living in the Washington area. I don't know where

30:47.107 --> 30:51.853
Horace is. Probably somewhere around Huntsville 
or a girl from East Texas, something like that. But

30:55.758 --> 30:59.423
we were just constantly together, all four of us. 
were in junior rotc and three of us were cadet

31:00.078 --> 31:16.585
captains and that just pretty much made our little 
group you know but uh we weren't ostracized i don't

31:00.078 --> 31:16.585
guess we ever really stopped to think are we well 
like you know What about leadership? I'm always

31:19.138 --> 31:25.167
interested when I talk to generals about 
developing, when did leadership develop? About

31:25.768 --> 31:26.589
what age? Some people, it starts very early. They 
start taking sort of leadership roles in school or

31:28.451 --> 31:32.778
at A&M. And then other people, it's not until 
they're in their 20s. When did you think you

31:35.502 --> 31:41.250
started to become

31:35.502 --> 31:41.250
a leader? Well, let's see.

31:45.944 --> 32:02.563
Looking back, I'd have to probably say that 
somewhere in the 10th grade, because it was then

31:45.944 --> 32:02.563
that they started narrowing down to determine who 
were going to be the company commanders the year

31:45.944 --> 32:02.563
following in high school.

32:07.028 --> 32:14.196
Though

32:07.028 --> 32:14.196
I'm always one to immediately, and A&M as we'll get 
to somewhere down the line.

32:21.810 --> 32:35.374
Drill field marketing and command to me is not 
necessarily leadership, but it's part, I mean,

32:21.810 --> 32:35.374
it's an outward sign or display of what a guy's 
willing to do. But we hadn't

32:42.728 --> 32:52.318
We had some things in our school that made it very 
difficult to be a company commander of ROTC.

32:52.418 --> 32:54.600
First, we had no campus. We were a masonry building 
built in a U-shape with an asphalt court in

32:54.680 --> 33:05.791
downtown Houston. And in order to perfect close 
order drill, we actually had to leave the block or

33:08.564 --> 33:29.073
the campus and go some eight or 10 blocks away into a 
neighborhood that was sparsely populated and

33:08.564 --> 33:29.073
then actually drill on the city streets where 
there was very little, no traffic. And that was

33:29.093 --> 33:37.845
completely in the hands of the cadet company 
commander to get them out there and get them back on

33:29.093 --> 33:37.845
time and be sure he got them all back And we were 
drilling with rifles, I mean, on the street. And

33:46.276 --> 33:54.246
then each year, the various companies competed, 
even though we had three companies at Sam Houston.

33:55.647 --> 34:02.736
All of the companies in the Houston area would 
compete in close-order competition at small

33:55.647 --> 34:02.736
diamonds. Buffalo Stadium, which was a 
professional ball club in Houston, which was the

34:03.087 --> 34:19.552
best drill company in Houston, and so on.

34:23.297 --> 34:25.180
A lot of assistance is required of junior officers 
and non-commissioned officers. Even in a

34:32.877 --> 34:42.489
situation like that, just coping with a problem of 
not being able to drill right, you know, get the

34:32.877 --> 34:42.489
rifles and go 100 yards outside and start 
drilling.

34:45.533 --> 34:46.514
The old man was around. Ventile was around every 
once in a while, but he wasn't standing over you the

34:46.534 --> 34:52.281
whole time to see that you did it right. ready to 
bark at you if you did it wrong. You have enough

34:56.279 --> 34:57.521
faith. When did they start this program? Do you 
remember? This high school military program? Oh,

35:02.488 --> 35:03.309
I don't know. Of course, it's going on now, but I 
don't know when it started. It had been going on,

35:09.618 --> 35:16.968
oh, I don't know, six or eight

35:09.618 --> 35:16.968
years before I was here. So it was probably 
developed sometime in the 30s? I wouldn't think

35:20.893 --> 35:22.015
so. But I don't know. And I think you'd only find it 
in the larger public schools because

35:24.857 --> 35:39.090
it was a financial burden that a small school 
system really couldn't maintain. This

35:40.231 --> 35:49.960
particular captain also taught physics at our 
high school so that he had both the military and

35:40.231 --> 35:49.960
physics. But then over the city, there was a 
full-time major, and he ultimately was promoted

35:50.716 --> 35:59.589
to lieutenant colonel. He was on active duty. He 
was an army officer. And he had three or four

36:05.257 --> 36:09.062
sergeants that he had to work for him. Because at 
the end of the year, we'd have to carry in all the

36:09.650 --> 36:19.066
arms out to certain locations so that they weren't 
stored in the high schools during the summer time.

36:19.086 --> 36:20.168
They were all stored in an armory. I don't know when 
it started. Now, tell me about your attempt to get

36:23.814 --> 36:28.021
into West Point. Was that your primary objective 
when you graduated from high school? Well, My

36:36.599 --> 36:42.127
primary objective was to become a commission 
officer.

36:44.390 --> 37:03.197
The attempt to get into West Point

36:44.390 --> 37:03.197
was one made knowing good and well that I couldn't 
do it because when I was six years old, five or six

36:44.390 --> 37:03.197
years old, a neighbor boy picked up a piece of 
asbestos roofing slate and sailed it across the

37:04.038 --> 37:10.645
yard and picked me up here. And it knocked... Right 
above the eye. Yeah. And it knocked the left lens

37:12.647 --> 37:17.632
over partially behind my nose. And it reduced my 
sight to 2060. Mm-hmm. And... Actually, it's 2200

37:24.078 --> 37:28.423
correctable to 2060. And...

37:31.797 --> 37:35.481
I knew that the chances of getting into West Point 
were slim. But nevertheless, one of the Texas

37:35.501 --> 37:44.911
senators offered the appointment. And I went to 
the doc and took the physical. And of course,

37:46.954 --> 37:50.217
there's no way of doing it. So OK, we're not going to 
do it at West Point. We're going to do it some other

37:52.960 --> 37:54.462
way. And physical restrictions and the reserve 
program have never been what they are to one of the

37:54.482 --> 38:01.770
academies. I know because my older son couldn't 
pass the one to get in the Air Force Academy and he's

38:02.442 --> 38:17.086
now a regular Air Force Major.

38:17.106 --> 38:21.093
Was your primary aim then to become an engineer 
then? Had you made that decision? Well, I'd have to

38:22.515 --> 38:26.361
say my primary aim was to become a commissioned 
officer. My secondary was to become an engineer.

38:29.037 --> 38:31.940
Okay, and that's why you decided to go to A&M? 
That's right. Okay, before we get to A&M, then,

38:34.262 --> 38:40.708
let's talk about the Great Depression. In what way 
did that have an impact? The what? The Depression

38:43.291 --> 38:44.552
of the 1930s. In what way did that have an impact on 
you or your family? Oh.

38:56.123 --> 38:56.884
I guess... The impact that it had was, of course, at 
A&M. I worked at something at A&M the whole time I

39:07.116 --> 39:12.984
was there. For example? Well,

39:14.927 --> 39:27.765
the head of the publicity department at Texas A&M 
G. Byron Winstead. Byron's mother lived three

39:32.077 --> 39:37.080
doors from our house where I was born and where I was 
reared. And from the day I entered school, I worked

39:37.718 --> 39:45.568
in the publishing department,

39:37.718 --> 39:45.568
flipping, typing. So I typed then with two 
fingers. I now use two fingers and two thumbs, and I

39:49.213 --> 39:56.202
can probably get up to 60, 65 words a minute, 
something like that. But that's the way many

39:56.382 --> 40:01.228
people learn to type and still type.

40:03.082 --> 40:08.288
The fact is I was on, what do you call it, the team 
that helped make John Kimbrough All-American.

40:08.608 --> 40:20.981
Because, sure, the guy makes it on the football 
field, but if he had got the publicity department

40:08.608 --> 40:20.981
behind him that's pushing the statistics and 
pushing the stories and everything else, you

40:08.608 --> 40:20.981
know, everything kind of falls in the cracks. But 
that was a paying job. Well, see, we're at A&M now,

40:24.845 --> 40:28.950
back up and forth. My junior year, I was a... Junior 
sports editor, which was the assistant sports

40:32.107 --> 40:36.052
editor. It's a paying job, or it was on the 
battalion. At that time, the battalion was three

40:39.295 --> 40:41.398
times a week. I don't know what it is now. Probably 
daily now. We were three times a week. My senior

40:46.824 --> 40:48.506
year, I was the sports editor.

40:52.211 --> 40:57.777
My roommate and I had

40:52.211 --> 40:57.777
each had a cleaning and pressing concession 
within our organization. So any way that we could

41:04.892 --> 41:11.681
make a buck, we would make a buck.

41:14.765 --> 41:26.481
The summer of

41:14.765 --> 41:26.481
either the summer of 40 or the summer of 39,

41:29.684 --> 41:44.087
Another

41:29.684 --> 41:44.087
cadet who I give an awful lot of credit to, what I 
learned and where I went and what all I've done, by

41:29.684 --> 41:44.087
the name of E.C.G. Boats, he was also in the sports 
racket like I was in. O-A-T-S?

41:51.799 --> 41:54.003
O-A-T-E-S, E.C.G. Boats. I'll look him up in the 
directory in there.

41:59.030 --> 42:10.549
He and I washed every window on A&M campus, except 
the dormitories, inside and out. Two people

42:10.609 --> 42:12.071
couldn't do that now. But back in that day and time, 
but it took us half the summer to do it. But that was

42:19.444 --> 42:22.368
our job. We were employed to do it. How much did you 
make, a quarter and a half? Whatever the student

42:27.533 --> 42:29.776
wage was. I'm thankful to have it because, you 
know, I doubt that it was probably not much more

42:29.996 --> 42:42.311
than that, you know. I attended summer school a 
couple of summers. During the summers, I worked as

42:47.950 --> 42:50.434
a table waiter. I did not work as a table waiter 
during the record years because I couldn't do that

42:50.494 --> 42:58.085
and do the newspaper work also. The newspaper work 
even took me away from the campus. You were in

43:03.392 --> 43:06.717
California? Oh, yeah. When A&M played UCLA in 
1940, I went out with a team. That was out on the

43:12.345 --> 43:14.088
train. As a sports editor? Yeah. I bet you that was a 
great experience. Oh, it was terrific. Was that

43:19.181 --> 43:21.824
the first time you ever left Texas? Yeah, it 
probably was. Dean E.J. Kyle was the dean of

43:27.431 --> 43:34.740
agriculture and the head of athletics for A&M. He 
was whatever that ruling committee is. A

43:37.984 --> 43:45.733
fellow by the name of Angel was the faculty advisor 
to the battalion, and Angel will come up later on in

43:46.388 --> 43:51.516
my military life. And the two of them said, why 
shouldn't we take the sports editor with us? Well,

43:59.069 --> 43:59.910
there we went. That was quite a thing to go out, stay 
in the Hollywood Roosevelt, cover the game from

44:01.333 --> 44:13.172
the press box out there. Just represent A&M, train 
come back. What did you think? What did you think of

44:19.236 --> 44:21.599
California? Oh, I thought it was everything that 
everybody else did.

44:29.828 --> 44:31.510
Fantastic. We had a good one with Mary Martin. 
Let's draw off the record on that. Well, you can

44:35.134 --> 44:38.098
edit anything out if you want. Kimbrough had shin 
splints. And the coach was keeping him under rapid

44:42.532 --> 44:58.527
key, and I thought that was the last thing we 
wanted, was to let UCLA know that something was

44:42.532 --> 44:58.527
wrong with his legs, because that's the first 
thing they'd go for, you know, to try to get him out

44:42.532 --> 44:58.527
of the game. Mary Barton, a good old Texas gal, 
well, they brought her up to the hotel to make some

44:58.547 --> 45:09.838
publicity shots and said, now, Mary, we're going 
to give you a thermometer, and we want you to take

44:58.547 --> 45:09.838
John's temperature. And Mary says, what did I do? 
Put it in his mouth? John said, Mary, have you ever

45:15.584 --> 45:18.549
taken a cow temperature? She said, no. And he said, 
well, stick it in my mouth. Stick it in my mouth. He

45:22.174 --> 45:24.978
was just disgusted as hell.

45:28.543 --> 45:31.548
No, back to the Depression. Dad and Mom managed to 
keep the college bills paid. And then it was up to me

45:41.813 --> 45:45.116
to make the rest of it. Spending money, that

45:46.818 --> 45:53.025
was up to me. What political persuasion was your 
father? You said that he ran for office. Democrat.

45:57.789 --> 45:59.091
And what type of Democrat? A liberal Democrat, 
moderate, or conservative? Well, back in the old

46:03.335 --> 46:05.577
days, I don't know. I wouldn't really say. He has, 
since then... He was one conservative

46:12.020 --> 46:15.423
Republican, and then he went back. I happen to know 
that dad and mother both supported Carter when

46:15.523 --> 46:27.814
Carter was elected president.

46:28.175 --> 46:42.027
I guess one of the reasons the Depression didn't 
really hurt us too much is this was one of the long

46:28.175 --> 46:42.027
stretches that my dad worked for the city.

46:43.306 --> 47:03.373
so he wasn't having to use his card as a machinist to 
get a job and so on but

46:43.306 --> 47:03.373
uh even at that time

46:43.306 --> 47:03.373
i can remember many many meals when i was in high 
school many many meatless needs
