WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:05.288
Okay.

00:07.230 --> 00:10.253
Have you had a chance to interview John Bertrand? 
No. If we could ever get him here. He is now

00:15.519 --> 00:20.924
president of, what is it? I can never remember the 
name. The Barry. The Barry School. President of

00:25.209 --> 00:29.013
the Barry School.

00:29.053 --> 00:31.455
He could tell you a great deal because he was in the 
formative period of the basic division. When I was

00:35.809 --> 00:39.818
with them, of course, it was just the freshman 
annex. But he was there when the division itself

00:41.181 --> 00:45.951
was organized as a union. for administering the 
work of all freshmen. When you say he was there in

00:50.258 --> 00:55.343
the formative, this would be at the time it was 
established at the end? Yes, and then he became its

00:55.363 --> 00:57.225
dean. And he stayed with it then until it was 
disbanded as a separate unit? Yes.

01:08.337 --> 01:12.681
Here again, my memory may be tricking me a little 
bit.

01:17.285 --> 01:29.021
I'm not sure that he did not become president of the 
Berry schools

01:17.285 --> 01:29.021
before the Basic Division was disbanded. But I'm 
sure you've got a record of that, and you can check

01:29.421 --> 01:32.746
on that. I think I have some material on the Basic 
Division. And I can tell you someone else who knows

01:35.890 --> 01:45.503
a great deal about it is Cliff Randstuhl, who is 
associate dean of the College of Engineering. He

01:48.644 --> 01:57.178
and I and John were all associated with the 
freshman annex in the basic division. Well, I

01:57.198 --> 02:05.331
think it's commonly stated around here that one 
reason for it was to help control the hazing. You

02:06.121 --> 02:10.507
know, this is why the freshmen were chosen to go off 
campus rather than, say, the seniors. But I

02:11.088 --> 02:19.540
presume the freshman class was the largest, so it 
also would be the best one to have separated that

02:11.088 --> 02:19.540
you had to separate. Exactly.

02:23.025 --> 02:25.388
You then... Oh, I do know. John Bertrand did leave 
before the basic division was disbanded, and he

02:26.990 --> 02:35.622
was followed by Dr. Kahn, who later became 
president of Oklahoma State University. I think

02:46.412 --> 02:52.767
he left us to become dean of the College of Arts and 
Sciences there and then was later made president.

02:54.147 --> 02:55.529
Oklahoma State. So you went from the head of the 
basic division and also you were, I guess, as

02:55.549 --> 03:04.280
assistant dean of the college, your 
responsibility was being head of the basic

02:55.549 --> 03:04.280
division. Is that? That's it, yeah. And then you 
became the dean of arts and sciences for about

03:06.543 --> 03:11.009
three years. From, yes. For four years. Longer 
than that, yes. It was four years, I guess it was.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.905
And then dean of the college for another... Three 
or four years. Then went on leave with the

03:25.817 --> 03:32.766
Commission on Higher Education as its first 
program examiner. I was with them for 15 months and

03:33.366 --> 03:47.543
then came back to the Department of English and 
remained in it until I retired in 72.

03:49.970 --> 04:05.285
Were there any significant occurrences while, 
say, you were dean of arts and sciences, any

03:49.970 --> 04:05.285
significant changes that were made in that 
particular area that might bear mentioning? Did

04:06.707 --> 04:10.350
you start any new programs or anything of that 
nature?

04:13.093 --> 04:19.099
Yes, although I doubt if I could claim much credit 
for them. What had been a department in the College

04:20.159 --> 04:44.158
of, I mean in the School of Agriculture,

04:20.159 --> 04:44.158
called Agricultural Administration, became a 
department in the College of Liberal Arts, the

04:20.159 --> 04:44.158
Department of Business,

04:20.159 --> 04:44.158
under Professor Leland, Professor Tom Leland.

04:47.125 --> 05:03.183
And it was also at that time that the Department of 
Oceanography was created and assigned to the

04:47.125 --> 05:03.183
College of Arts and Sciences under its first head, 
Dale Leper, Dr. Leper. Now, it was the Department

05:05.105 --> 05:16.558
of Oceanography then, although one of its options 
was meteorology and became, of course, later on, a

05:05.105 --> 05:16.558
program on its own. And those two things were done.

05:28.710 --> 05:35.597
I don't believe any other departments were 
established then.

05:35.617 --> 05:38.961
No, education and psychology was still there.

05:42.745 --> 05:45.988
Of course, the makeup, and I'm sure old catalogs 
would show you this, was entirely different from

05:46.492 --> 05:49.637
what it is as a College of Liberal Arts. As a matter 
of fact,

05:49.677 --> 06:04.221
I have been spun off from the College of Liberal 
Arts, the College of Science, the College of

05:49.677 --> 06:04.221
Geosciences, the College of Business 
Administration. And education. And the College

06:05.383 --> 06:06.605
of Education. They've all spun off. Arts and 
Sciences. From Arts and Sciences. So you, in a

06:12.665 --> 06:19.833
sense, while you were dean of arts and sciences, 
you had everything that wasn't even, that wasn't

06:12.665 --> 06:19.833
either engineering or agriculture. I'll better 
name that. Yes. Okay. Then you went up to the, I say

06:24.498 --> 06:41.237
went up, I presume it was a promotion up to the dean 
of the college, which was equivalent to current

06:24.498 --> 06:41.237
vice president for academic affairs, which then 
puts you what? uh one level below the president at

06:41.403 --> 07:09.975
that time of course we also had a chancellor so the 
the president was one level below the chancellor

06:41.403 --> 07:09.975
and i was below the president kind of executive 
deanship so the the the deans of this other schools

06:41.403 --> 07:09.975
of the various schools reported through you to the 
press to the president of texas that's right

07:11.238 --> 07:18.067
I noted that you asked to be relieved of that 
position and go back to full-time teaching. Was

07:18.127 --> 07:23.454
that, had you had about all that you wanted of 
administration? Just about. And you enjoyed the

07:26.479 --> 07:30.464
teaching more than you did administration, I take 
it? I also enjoyed my work with the commission. 15

07:34.590 --> 07:36.452
months I was with them. Let's see, when you went 
back to teaching of English, I take it you had not

07:37.107 --> 07:45.376
been doing any teaching while you were in these 
various administrative positions. I continued

07:45.416 --> 07:56.247
to teach as long as I was at the annex, but after that 
I did not teach any more. By the time you went back to

07:56.267 --> 08:02.153
the department, you were then offering graduate 
degrees, I believe, were you not? Or did masters

08:03.247 --> 08:05.169
come in later than that? I think masters didn't 
come in right away. Let's see. Although it was not

08:11.878 --> 08:15.702
long before we began to offer a master's degree.

08:18.326 --> 08:20.188
And then, of course, still later the doctorate. 
And I am really very happy, in a small way, that I was

08:21.790 --> 08:30.621
able to stay with the department long enough to see 
two doctoral candidates through.

08:37.993 --> 08:40.977
You chaired the committee for two doctoral 
candidates. That's right. And I'm sure served on

08:41.778 --> 08:44.201
other committees as well. Oh,

08:44.221 --> 08:48.806
yeah. Back to this service on the Texas Commission 
on Higher Education, you were their first program

08:48.826 --> 08:55.595
examiner. Would you explain just exactly what 
that means? The staff at that time consisted of

09:01.617 --> 09:11.026
three people and some clerical help. There was the 
director, who was Dr. Ralph Green, now with the

09:11.046 --> 09:21.596
Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. There was the 
program examiner, and I will fill that position,

09:21.616 --> 09:31.405
and there was a

09:21.616 --> 09:31.405
finance examiner, who was Dr. Walker from the 
University of Texas. And that was the staff. Of

09:42.546 --> 09:45.189
course, I should say this. We were staff people 
working for the members of the commission. And we

09:53.538 --> 09:57.683
had to define our own job. We had to plan it. We had to 
get the whole organization going. Because it was

10:02.609 --> 10:04.011
brand new at that point. It was brand new, yes. And 
we had to find out really what we were to do. Now, as

10:09.658 --> 10:28.982
program examiner, it was my job to become familiar 
with all the academic offerings and all of the

10:09.658 --> 10:28.982
publicly supported institutions of higher 
education, not including junior colleges, which

10:09.658 --> 10:28.982
were at that time under the Texas Education Agency

10:29.468 --> 10:53.721
but all the four-year institutions familiarize 
myself with them and make recommendations to the

10:29.468 --> 10:53.721
commission on whether some programs should be 
deleted or whether programs should be added And we

10:54.494 --> 11:03.548
also made recommendations, as the present 
commission does, on petitions for new programs.

11:03.608 --> 11:07.013
We made recommendations to members of the 
commission. There was a great deal of talk at that

11:08.515 --> 11:21.295
time throughout the state about proliferation 
and institutions were proliferating programs

11:08.515 --> 11:21.295
and costing the state an unholy amount of money. 
And the commission was created, among other

11:23.317 --> 11:31.369
things, to see if there was this proliferation. Of 
course, the tremendous growth in students later

11:32.050 --> 11:41.104
on made that purely academic, an academic 
question, but it was not an academic question at

11:32.050 --> 11:41.104
the time at all. And another thing, of course, was 
to see if it was possible to make sense out of

11:43.127 --> 11:51.940
appropriation.

11:55.987 --> 12:15.468
instead of having every president go to the 
legislature and get what he could on whatever

11:55.987 --> 12:15.468
basis he could, this was an effort to do it 
logically and according to some kind of formula so

11:55.987 --> 12:15.468
that everybody would be treated the same way as 
everybody else. And formulas are still in

12:15.488 --> 12:20.152
existence. We've tried recently to change that 
for him. Yeah. Not to go off the formula system, but

12:23.932 --> 12:32.463
I think we tried for the library in view of the fact 
that we have to serve as Ag's extension and

12:23.932 --> 12:32.463
experiment station. We tried to get a different 
formula for library support for A&M. In fact, we

12:36.348 --> 12:42.035
may well have outgrown that conception of the 
formula. But it made an awful lot of sense then.

12:48.343 --> 12:52.909
I was lucky enough to sit in on many of the meetings, 
even of the from the financial side because the

12:53.227 --> 12:57.214
program was involved so much in the financing. Say 
if a college or university in Texas at that point

12:59.217 --> 13:17.067
wanted to start an entirely new program, say they 
wanted to begin offering a degree in business

12:59.217 --> 13:17.067
administration where they had not in the past, did 
that proposal to create that new program come

12:59.217 --> 13:17.067
through your office then? Yes. But by the same 
token, if you saw the need for a new department

13:18.488 --> 13:23.996
somewhere, you could recommend that, I take it. 
Although, to my knowledge, that was never done.

13:30.667 --> 13:31.588
Were there many programs? It could have been.

13:37.076 --> 13:41.904
At first, the commission was, as you might expect, 
very, very conservative. And it... It

13:46.788 --> 13:55.781
scrutinized very carefully every request, even 
for new courses, not new programs, not new degree

13:46.788 --> 13:55.781
programs, but even new courses.

14:00.428 --> 14:11.344
The commission, I thought, when I was with them, 
was a very fine body and a dedicated group of

14:00.428 --> 14:11.344
people. i think they did look upon themselves as 
representing not parts of the state but the state

14:12.674 --> 14:40.453
as a whole i don't know whether that remained true 
of later commissions or not but it was true i think

14:12.674 --> 14:40.453
of that first one has has the work the type of work 
that you did for the commission has that been taken

14:12.674 --> 14:40.453
over now by the coordinating board that's yeah the 
coordinating board succeeded the commission on

14:12.674 --> 14:40.453
higher education okay

14:12.674 --> 14:40.453
uh

14:46.424 --> 14:47.445
Well, I know what I'm going to ask. Were there many 
programs that were proposed but subsequently

14:47.465 --> 14:56.434
turned down while you were in the commissioner's 
office? No, because there were not very many that

14:56.794 --> 15:02.980
were proposed in the 15 months that I was there. I 
think that the institutions probably were

15:03.681 --> 15:15.672
deliberately holding back a little bit to see how 
the commission would function and let it get on its

15:03.681 --> 15:15.672
feet. I think some requests were made almost 
immediately after I came back. Did you know when

15:22.164 --> 15:28.573
you went to the commission as program examiner 
that you would be there only one year? I had gone on

15:28.774 --> 15:31.578
leave only for a year. I suspect I could have gotten 
an extension. I think I would have been granted an

15:35.724 --> 15:37.507
extension. And I almost asked for it, but then I did 
want to get back to my teaching. It must have been

15:45.335 --> 15:54.484
quite an honor for you to be the one person selected 
from the whole state of Texas to occupy that

15:45.335 --> 15:54.484
position. Well, I don't know how much of an honor it 
was, but it was certainly a very enjoyable

15:55.405 --> 16:01.351
experience and a very worthwhile one. But I mean, 
they had to be somebody with some degree of

16:01.371 --> 16:10.920
knowledge about college administration in that 
position. Well, I certainly appreciated the fact

16:11.288 --> 16:19.859
that Dr. Green, who was the director, did ask me to 
come and serve his program exam. Well, as I said,

16:19.879 --> 16:22.963
you were the one person from the whole state. Well, 
he could have found others, I'm sure. But he did

16:26.728 --> 16:28.690
come to you and asked you. Yes, he did. So then in 57, 
and you returned in the fall of 57, I think, you

16:30.653 --> 16:39.304
returned back to College Station and resumed your 
teaching. Did you still have to do mostly freshman

16:39.993 --> 16:44.178
English at that point? No. No, I did not at that 
time. Although, and this may sound surprising, I

16:45.841 --> 16:58.357
wanted to teach freshmen and almost always had at 
least one section of freshmen. I had a belief then,

16:58.377 --> 17:07.789
and I'm not sure that I've changed it since, that 
senior members of the department ought to teach

16:58.377 --> 17:07.789
freshmen. So I really asked for at least one 
freshman section. Now that was not true later on as

17:16.283 --> 17:21.249
we got much, much bigger.

17:24.453 --> 17:36.207
I gradually dropped my freshman word, but that was 
not for a number of years after I came back, well

17:24.453 --> 17:36.207
into the 60s

17:24.453 --> 17:36.207
when we were having graduate courses and so on. I'm 
not so sure that I still don't think that senior

17:36.541 --> 17:43.207
members of a department should teach freshmen. 
Well, I think that's a fairly widely held opinion

17:43.227 --> 17:49.213
in certain areas. I know that when I was at Ohio 
State, every faculty member in the history

17:49.333 --> 17:56.980
department had one section of freshman history 
each year. So no matter how long you'd been at Ohio

17:57.820 --> 18:03.726
State, you still taught freshman history one 
semester. And I say that realizing that sometimes

18:05.245 --> 18:16.218
a graduate assistant is a better teacher of 
freshmen than maybe a senior member. But I think

18:16.238 --> 18:21.003
it's for the good of the senior member as much as for 
the good of freshmen. Well, I think at times,

18:21.023 --> 18:34.138
however, a graduate assistant, maybe not quite so 
much, but a brand new PhD, I think, has a tendency to

18:21.023 --> 18:34.138
expect far too much from Freshmen, perhaps many of 
them, have not had a very good background in high

18:34.507 --> 18:38.797
school. That could be. We had some inkling of that 
last year here when a young fellow had done a lot of

18:41.624 --> 18:52.650
work up here for a paper he had to write. I think he 
came back and told us that, I don't know, something

18:53.238 --> 18:59.166
like 70% or 80% of the class had not passed the 
course. And this was a new faculty member who,

18:59.947 --> 19:05.394
unfortunately, was not going to be back the 
following year. The student, at least, his

19:05.735 --> 19:17.490
version of it was that the faculty member showed a 
great lack of concern for the students under him.

19:18.196 --> 19:26.152
But I think that this young PhD had expected a great 
deal more than he should have from freshman. I

19:26.613 --> 19:30.521
think I found myself in the same trap when I taught 
high school history for one year. I expected more

19:30.541 --> 19:32.565
of my students than I should have. And I've 
observed that when my son has had new graduates as

19:36.910 --> 19:42.397
teachers in the public schools that they 
sometimes expect far more than they should. And

19:42.557 --> 19:49.626
someone who's had some more experience knows more 
of what to expect from a course. Plus, I think in

19:49.646 --> 19:58.638
some respects, it's better for the freshman 
student to have someone who's had a fair amount of

19:49.646 --> 19:58.638
experience in teaching. Yes. And it is quite 
possible that the fledgling instructor expects

20:06.779 --> 20:08.261
more than he should. Well, his most recent 
experience has been with his own graduate

20:09.202 --> 20:24.423
studies, and if he had to read 150 pages a week and 
write three term papers in the semester, why, then

20:09.202 --> 20:24.423
he figured freshmen ought to be able to do that too. 
Yeah. And I would think a graduate student at least

20:26.346 --> 20:34.457
ought to be somewhat more mature and be able to 
budget his time better than many freshmen are able

20:26.346 --> 20:34.457
to do. So you continued to teach in the English 
department until you retired then in 72. Was

20:41.856 --> 20:52.749
most of that recent service under one department 
head or was that under more than one? It was under

20:54.751 --> 20:56.053
more than one. Dr.

20:56.073 --> 21:04.663
Stuart Morgan for most of that time

21:06.854 --> 21:14.466
He had replaced Dr. Mayo, who also had asked to be 
relieved of administrative work. And Dr. Morgan

21:16.288 --> 21:25.162
then was had for many years until his own 
retirement to modified service. He was followed

21:26.884 --> 21:33.975
by Dr. John Anderson, who subsequently went to the 
University of Houston. He was followed by Dr. Lee

21:34.968 --> 21:46.942
Martin, who died while here, and he was followed by 
Dr. Hurth, the present here. And I was under Dr.

21:46.962 --> 21:55.873
Hurth, Dr. Martin, and on through to Morgan.

21:56.674 --> 21:57.094
Okay. A year ago you were chosen as the speaker for 
A&M's first formal summer commencement, and I

21:58.188 --> 22:10.964
believe I wrote you at that time and you didn't have 
a copy of your speech. No, I didn't. I'm not going to

22:13.287 --> 22:14.629
ask you for a copy now. But anyway, did you look upon 
that as somewhat of an honor to have been chosen as

22:14.649 --> 22:22.018
the first summer commencement speaker indeed yes 
i would have considered it an honor to be asked to

22:23.399 --> 22:50.217
speak to graduating students yes

22:23.399 --> 22:50.217
there is one honor that i have been proud of i mean as 
a teacher i was fortunate enough to be the

22:23.399 --> 22:50.217
recipient of one of the faculty achievement 
awards oh back in 1962

22:52.660 --> 22:56.188
Six years after I came back into teaching. Well, I 
think anybody would be justifiably proud to

22:57.712 --> 23:09.640
receive one of those achievement awards and the 
fact that they give out 12 in a year and what they're

22:57.712 --> 23:09.640
now about. something over 1,000 members of the 
faculty, I believe. I think you're right. So maybe

23:14.909 --> 23:19.576
like one in 1,000 gets one now. That's a fairly 
small percentage. Yeah, that's a small

23:25.625 --> 23:27.628
percentage. I've been somewhat interested in the 
last couple of years from which I've attended that

23:27.668 --> 23:39.306
many of them are relatively new faculty members, 
particularly who received the teaching awards.

23:39.607 --> 23:44.058
Some of the research awards go on occasion to older 
faculty members. I think that's really very

23:46.464 --> 23:50.494
encouraging that the younger teachers are very

23:54.946 --> 24:14.011
Well, I think some of our newer members, this will 
sound kind of odd after what I just got through

23:54.946 --> 24:14.011
saying about the young man in English faculty, but 
I think some of our newer teachers have come along

23:54.946 --> 24:14.011
at a point where technology has advanced so much 
that they are more familiar with some of the

23:54.946 --> 24:14.011
teaching aids than some of the older ones. Oh, 
unquestionably, that enters into it. Therefore,

24:15.573 --> 24:22.202
they can make a more interesting learning 
experience for their students someone who has not

24:22.672 --> 24:29.562
had the experience and does not have the 
capabilities of working with the teaching aides

24:22.672 --> 24:29.562
that are available.

24:37.153 --> 24:52.375
Have you noticed in the many years you've been here 
any degree of changes in the types or quality of

24:37.153 --> 24:52.375
students which we have had.

24:58.102 --> 25:15.822
I am told that statistics indicate very clearly 
that on the average the preparation of our

24:58.102 --> 25:15.822
students has been better than it was in earlier 
year.

25:18.445 --> 25:18.885
But of course

25:21.667 --> 25:28.033
When I came, it was possible to know a major part of 
all the students. I mean, for a faculty member to

25:28.053 --> 25:30.455
know them. And I think when you get to know students 
individually, you tend to rate them very highly

25:30.475 --> 25:40.844
because they are not statistics to you. And so 
while I'm quite sure the statistics are accurate,

25:40.864 --> 25:51.353
that on the average, our entering students do have 
better preparation than they once had. I think it

25:52.109 --> 26:05.861
would be awfully hard to beat some of those earlier 
students who of course went on and did make names

25:52.109 --> 26:05.861
for themselves in all kinds of occupations.

26:06.261 --> 26:22.015
I wonder whether maybe some of that is that perhaps 
a larger percentage of our students are now coming

26:06.261 --> 26:22.015
from larger cities where the public high school 
education is perhaps a little bit more advanced

26:06.261 --> 26:22.015
than it is in some of the rural areas from which we 
got most of our students a few decades ago.

26:29.434 --> 26:37.245
Of course, we also have a better retention rate 
now, do we not, than we did? I haven't really seen

26:37.265 --> 26:38.808
any statistics. I've had people tell me that they 
think that we retain more than we used to. And how

26:45.704 --> 26:56.840
much of that is because of academic, and I've had 
some indication that some of the people left

26:45.704 --> 26:56.840
because of the military aspect. Well, that was 
true. And with the lessening of that, I would

26:57.881 --> 27:08.636
think, that factor would decline in importance.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.340
But... I guess there's no question, what if the 
students are better prepared when they come?

27:15.174 --> 27:21.301
They're better able to cope with the increased 
difficulty of the learning process. And

27:21.361 --> 27:34.075
you were asking me at the beginning of our talk, 
what could you do in the bachelor club? Well,

27:35.456 --> 27:38.299
there's more for students to do now, huh? 
Undoubtedly, there is. There used to be a general

27:39.461 --> 27:41.783
exodus Friday afternoon. Students

27:43.888 --> 27:51.417
would go as far away as Dallas or Fort Worth or San 
Antonio. And while there may still be an exodus, I

27:52.218 --> 27:55.802
don't know. I suspect that there is so much more for 
students to do here that there's not the felt need

27:55.822 --> 28:09.839
to go.

28:09.859 --> 28:10.740
We had one commandant, a very salty commandant,

28:11.294 --> 28:19.967
who made a remark I'll never forget. He said, if we 
had a one-way court trip to hell, there would be

28:20.007 --> 28:29.502
some students who wanted to leave a day early.

28:34.289 --> 28:36.272
And that was pretty true. You know, for a long time 
we had a six-day week. His classes were held

28:40.201 --> 28:42.204
Saturday. It was not until I was in administrative 
work that we reserved Saturday for the military

28:43.385 --> 29:01.568
part of the program and went to a five-day college 
week.

29:03.809 --> 29:10.956
I believe, let's see, in, what, 62, when there was 
the previous self-study, you were in charge of

29:03.809 --> 29:10.956
that. Only as the editor. Editor of the final 
report. Yes. But I believe someone told me that

29:16.161 --> 29:25.589
your review at that point, at least the published 
review, was not quite as elaborate as the one...

29:16.161 --> 29:25.589
No. Nothing like. In fact, I was amazed at how much 
more complex this... years' self-study, or

29:32.969 --> 29:39.054
rather, I mean, this time's self-study was than 
the one that we did. That was our first experience,

29:39.094 --> 29:56.030
and I think everybody in the institution was 
groping his way at that time, and we weren't quite

29:39.094 --> 29:56.030
sure, but it was nothing like the elaborate 
document. You say that was the first time. Was A&M

29:57.231 --> 29:59.533
not accredited by the Southern Association? I 
don't think they had ever... No, I could be wrong. I

30:03.103 --> 30:06.187
could have been conscious of it before. But that's 
the first one I can remember. A full-scale one.

30:13.695 --> 30:14.656
Well, it seems strange. You've been a member of the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools for

30:14.676 --> 30:18.981
a long, long time. And maybe they had earlier ones 
that I just didn't know about, but I don't think so.

30:23.426 --> 30:25.048
I think that was the first one. Well, certainly you 
were in an administrative position in the Dean of

30:25.332 --> 30:29.563
Arts and Sciences at the time. The logical 
previous one would have been. Well, it would have

30:31.949 --> 30:33.192
been. You would have been involved. No, this is a 
much more elaborate. I know. I've got 16 feet of a

30:39.669 --> 30:41.012
table.
