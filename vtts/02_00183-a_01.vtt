WEBVTT

00:03.507 --> 00:16.159
I'm down in Conroe and have the very great honor of 
chatting with Bob Rucker about his memories of

00:03.507 --> 00:16.159
being a student and then being a key member of the 
staff at A&M. Bob, now check yours. Okay, Haskell,

00:19.362 --> 00:21.784
I'll do the best I can. I'll record some things.

00:26.669 --> 00:31.894
Bob, as we begin, for the sake of someone that might 
not know your background, begin by describing

00:32.583 --> 00:40.796
where you grew up, family background, where was 
home before coming to A&M. I grew up in the country

00:40.816 --> 00:45.684
town of Franklin, Texas, 35 miles northeast of 
A&M. And my mother died when I was a year and a half

00:46.746 --> 00:49.330
old. And my grandmother took me and my sister, who 
was three, to raise. And she was 47 years old and

00:54.739 --> 00:57.844
twice with her. So we lived in the country town 
hotel. And from the time we could walk, we had a job

01:00.578 --> 01:03.564
to do. And I met everybody in the world. I never met a 
stranger. I put people to bed at night as a night

01:07.632 --> 01:12.401
clerk and never remember a thing about the next 
morning. But I have one sister, and as I said, our

01:13.503 --> 01:22.941
mother died when I was a year and a half old from flu 
epidemic of World War I. And my father lived a long

01:23.427 --> 01:31.159
time and remarried and was never part of my life, 
really. It was our grandmother and an aunt and two

01:31.940 --> 01:39.912
girl cousins and my sister. I grew up with Six 
women. So anyway, then I went to A&M. What

01:47.971 --> 01:53.177
led you to go to A&M? Why there? We didn't know 
anything else but A&M, the whole family. If Robert

01:59.144 --> 02:01.347
ever went to school, that's where he was going. And 
we tried to go and wanted to go, but we didn't have

02:02.228 --> 02:05.592
any money. And finally, I got a job, Mr. Hensel, Mr. 
F. W. Hensel, who was just like a father to me all the

02:12.196 --> 02:16.244
years, and still is. I still respect him very much, 
even though he'd been gone a few years. He gave me a

02:21.253 --> 02:34.558
job in the greenhouse, and I got to work an extra 
hour every day because I had to run the heat and

02:21.253 --> 02:34.558
ventilate the greenhouse at night. I didn't know 
it, but that was quite a job to give a freshman. And

02:38.662 --> 02:42.846
anyway, I averaged working 22 hours a week. So when 
I graduated, personnel said, look, you've worked

02:42.866 --> 02:52.615
more than half time, so you're going to get five 
years prior credit for Social Security. So I took

02:53.896 --> 02:55.918
it. Now, did you go visit the campus before 
enrolling as a freshman? Yes. I went in the fall of

03:04.357 --> 03:29.655
spring of 32 but i couldn't didn't get to go to 
school until two years later in 34.

03:04.357 --> 03:29.655
but uh i am i remember the campus from the very 
beginning and of course i have enjoyed the campus

03:04.357 --> 03:29.655
many years there's a lot of history there describe 
the campus when you've what it what was there when

03:04.357 --> 03:29.655
you first got there what did it look like looked 
like heaven to an old country boy. I never saw as

03:33.803 --> 03:39.625
many flowers and different kinds of flowers in my 
life. I met Mr. Hensel. Kept that campus blooming

03:41.279 --> 03:44.483
all the time with flyers. We had sometimes 700, 800 
petunias in one bed. And there in front of the

03:51.431 --> 04:02.783
academic building, what I guess is now

03:51.431 --> 04:02.783
Jack, what's his name? Jack Williams. Jack 
Williams building. Well, at the time I was there,

04:10.979 --> 04:13.923
there was a small hedge in front of that 
balustrade. And when I got down there, you

04:14.764 --> 04:17.628
couldn't see the balustrade. It wasn't anything 
there. It was big, high arborvitaes.

04:22.494 --> 04:34.249
And two great big parterre beds on each end of that 
big plaza, where the flagpole is now, or was then

04:22.494 --> 04:34.249
there. But I cut those arborvitaes down. They were 
40 feet tall. And people had never seen that pile of

04:41.270 --> 04:43.753
straight. And also, the board wanted me to bring 
the flowers back to the campus. So Tom Cherry came

04:54.865 --> 05:00.591
up to Oklahoma to look at some high-rise dorms. And 
he saw that what we called a test garden, a very

05:01.452 --> 05:10.922
small garden at the time, it has since grown into a 
big garden And has been endowed by alumni every

05:11.594 --> 05:19.423
year for a big display of chrysanthemums. And it 
was so spectacular three or four years ago that the

05:20.084 --> 05:28.813
American chrysanthemums that he was meeting in 
Dallas drove up there to see it. And that

05:29.875 --> 05:35.661
precipitated the endowment or the upkeep of it by 
some alumni. I've been gone from Oklahoma for

05:36.417 --> 05:37.899
long. But anyway, the story of, we were going to 
give Ms. Johnson, the Northwest Chapter of the

05:37.919 --> 05:52.963
American Society of Landscape Architects, was 
going to give Ms. Johnson a citation for her beauty

05:37.919 --> 05:52.963
bills. She couldn't be there to accept it, so Ms. 
Rudder accepted it. She sat next to me all during

05:58.472 --> 06:01.737
the meeting, and we talked. She got back home, she 
said, Earl already told the board if they'd found

06:03.873 --> 06:07.257
the man, he'd hire him. So she got back home and 
says, I found the man for you. And she put my name in

06:10.982 --> 06:12.263
the pot. Oh, good. That's how I got back. Well, 
let's go back, though, to your freshman years.

06:20.673 --> 06:24.658
When you came to enroll, how did you come? How did 
you get there? And what stuff did you bring with

06:26.320 --> 06:28.382
you? What clothing? How much money? Somebody 
brought me down in the car. I don't know who it was. I

06:35.783 --> 06:36.424
don't remember. I didn't

06:36.444 --> 06:44.074
have much clothes. Nobody had much clothes during 
the Depression.

06:53.786 --> 06:55.969
I knew they were going to have uniforms. I didn't 
need many clothes, and that's why, thank goodness

06:56.843 --> 07:02.210
for the military, for a lot of reasons. I arrived on 
campus, and Mr. Hensel... This was the fall of 34.

07:11.543 --> 07:12.765
Fall of 34. Mr. Hensel gave me the job in the 
greenhouse. He told my aunt, he says, that guy can

07:16.370 --> 07:22.338
get more plants than my seniors do. Of course, I'd 
grown everything in Hastings Seed Catalog. I

07:25.750 --> 07:28.153
think it would come in January each year. And my 
grandmother said, now, Robert, pick out what you

07:28.955 --> 07:32.400
want, and we'll order it. And on one side of the 
hotel, we had about a half-acre garden. I raided

07:37.287 --> 07:39.390
all the vegetables that we used in the hotel. Other 
side, I could have anything I wanted, and we'd have

07:40.070 --> 07:42.594
a flower. So I grew. A lot of things, I didn't know 
they wouldn't grow in practice. I just planned the

07:49.194 --> 07:50.495
way they grew. And every now and then somebody 
said, well, what is that? Well, it can't grow here.

07:57.145 --> 07:58.648
I said, it is. Nobody told me I couldn't grow it. 
It's in the catalog, so I planned it. Do you

08:03.775 --> 08:07.781
remember how much money you brought with you when 
you were enrolled as a freshman? Practically

08:10.045 --> 08:11.567
none, I'll tell you that. We borrowed, we got a 
loan. from what they called the Farmer Students

08:15.363 --> 08:17.986
Association at that time. And it was a very small, 
it was hard to get a loan. But with my aunt

08:25.254 --> 08:33.524
underwriting the note, we got a loan from the, did 
we call it Exitutes of Farmers? I think we called it

08:33.544 --> 08:34.725
Farmers. Anyway. I just have to come in here and say 
hello to these two. Thank you. Describe Mr. Hensel

08:42.970 --> 08:51.660
as a person, physically, and what his nature was. 
One of the greatest men I ever knew in my life. He

08:56.145 --> 09:00.831
came from San Antonio and was used to lots of 
flowers in San Antonio. He put them on the campus.

09:03.294 --> 09:06.938
He had a good grower, Mr. Monosmith, P.B. 
Monosmith, M-O-N-O-S-M-I-T-H. lived in what we

09:10.156 --> 09:13.159
call Candy Hill. It's up north of the power plant 
there, as it does the faculty members. And Mr.

09:18.926 --> 09:23.451
Hensel was like a father to me. He found out that I 
knew the plants, and that I wanted to work, and I

09:24.713 --> 09:31.701
wasn't afraid to work, and so he gave me plenty to 
do. But he also, that's the news.

09:41.527 --> 09:53.885
Now, did he, did you come to A&M thinking you were 
going to major in... Mary Murchin, line one. Mary

09:53.905 --> 09:55.087
Murchin, line one. Did you come to A&M planning to 
major in horticulture, floriculture? I came to

09:58.972 --> 10:03.639
A&M to major in floriculture, but it wasn't in the 
floriculture department. The nearest thing to it

10:04.080 --> 10:06.403
was landscape art. And there's a good story there. 
He is the father of landscape architecture in the

10:10.349 --> 10:14.353
Southwest. Now, he knew his financial support was 
Dean Kyle. So he knew also, I think he was a student

10:20.459 --> 10:28.007
enough to know that it wouldn't take very much to 
change from landscape art to landscape

10:20.459 --> 10:28.007
architecture. But he knew that if he didn't keep it 
in the College of Agriculture, he wouldn't have

10:28.928 --> 10:33.673
any fun in it. That led to the development of 
landscape architecture as such. Mary Merchant,

10:38.952 --> 10:42.798
please dial extension 104. Mary Merchant, 104. 
They distribute our medicine here. Anytime we

10:46.464 --> 10:50.430
need a pill, they come to us. No, when I found Mr. 
Hensel, I thought I'd really found, well, he

10:50.951 --> 10:58.784
always was the finest man I knew. He had high 
standards. And he expected his students to be high

11:01.480 --> 11:04.066
standards. And we worked hard. If you worked hard, 
like he wanted you to, you made your grades and so

11:08.736 --> 11:14.108
forth. We had two or three old boys that didn't want 
to work as hard as he did. And they named him Butch.

11:21.422 --> 11:22.443
Very disrespectful. Anyway, they have a funny 
thing over in the College of Architecture where

11:23.504 --> 11:33.437
they've been honoring people. And they left 
Hensel out. So I corrected that real quick the next

11:37.161 --> 11:40.245
year. I wrote out all the background and gave it to 
him. But he was my real mentor, and I followed him

11:46.434 --> 11:56.068
all the rest of my life. Every time I'd go back to 
campus, there were two people I'd go to see. I'd go

12:01.216 --> 12:06.063
to see Mr. Hensel and Mrs. Walton.

12:07.645 --> 12:09.608
We'll chat about her later. How did you get 
assigned to the Corps? What outfit and how did you

12:15.488 --> 12:20.279
get oriented? Well, I was assigned to A Infantry. 
There were a couple of boys from Franklin in the

12:26.682 --> 12:30.287
Corps. One was Taylor Wilkins, a football player, 
and he wasn't very military. But anyway, that's

12:36.477 --> 12:39.341
why I was assigned to A Infantry. And A Infantry 
lived in Hart Hall. I lived in a little room behind

12:43.568 --> 12:50.498
the greenhouse to take care of the stuff at night. 
And it's clear across the campus. And I would work

12:52.882 --> 12:55.626
till 5 o'clock, no, 6 o'clock, and just barely make 
it in time for formation, for me to formate. In

13:04.241 --> 13:06.003
fact, I was usually late. And two sophomores 
whipped me, paged me all year, because they said I

13:06.984 --> 13:16.976
never did, I couldn't get to me to formate on time. 
And finally, the Red Company commander, Ray

13:18.097 --> 13:23.824
Thompson, from the right warden, Caught them 
patting me one day. They're supposed to quit at

13:26.427 --> 13:29.531
Christmas. It's well up in the spring. And he said, 
now, why do you feel he's a fish rocker? Well, he

13:35.279 --> 13:37.803
never gets to the meal farm ages on time. Well, he 
said, did you know he worked till 6 o'clock? No, he

13:41.548 --> 13:42.249
didn't tell us. I said, you didn't ask us. And I 
said, I couldn't tell you anyway. I said, this I'm

13:50.376 --> 13:52.038
not allowed to even think. I was insulting them 
right back. And well, from then on, they left me

13:56.483 --> 13:58.866
alone. He said, if I catch you with a hazing fish 
right again, you'll wish you hadn't been born. So

14:04.633 --> 14:06.455
that was over with. They kept asking me all year, 
why didn't you tell us that you were? You didn't ask

14:10.720 --> 14:11.241
me. It's that simple. Anyway, we won the best drill 
company two years in a row, and we were all very

14:13.383 --> 14:21.595
proud of that. They called it the Howe Trophy, and I 
know we worked our socks off on that. Now, you all

14:28.125 --> 14:32.872
would fall in in front of Hart Hall and march. No, 
Sabisa. Sabisa. Describe the routine in the

14:35.697 --> 14:41.365
dining hall for fish. Pretty rough. You didn't get 
any dessert for 38 days. That's your class year.

14:51.746 --> 14:54.429
And if you didn't know the number, you'd start all 
over. And somebody, I never knew the number. So we

14:57.473 --> 15:01.559
didn't have any dessert until well after 
Christmas. And that kind of stuff. I stopped. But

15:05.364 --> 15:07.546
it was all family style. And you...

15:11.888 --> 15:15.872
Well, you passed everything back and forth.

15:17.694 --> 15:19.656
Mary Merchant, please dial extension 104. Mary 
Merchant, extension 104. A fish ate after

15:23.340 --> 15:25.622
everybody else. And every now and then, somebody 
would do this. Wave their hands. Well, if a girl was

15:34.191 --> 15:40.478
there, if an opposite had a girl, and boy, did he get 
upset. Somebody crawled under there and put

15:40.728 --> 15:43.071
muscular issues. And that didn't go over too well 
with the upperclassmen. And you were supposed to

15:50.361 --> 15:54.988
bring things out of the mess hall to the 
upperclassmen. Friends, we had rolls. Oh, I guess

15:57.912 --> 15:59.755
six or eight in a bunch, you know. And you'd stick 
them under your arm and walk out. And every now and

16:03.199 --> 16:09.368
then, somebody would put a pie in their stomach, 
you know, and pull a shirt over it. I had a real good

16:09.854 --> 16:24.787
friend, Freddie Knapp, from K-N-A-P-P, from 
Calvert, and he put a cherry pie in there one day,

16:09.854 --> 16:24.787
and the sergeant saw it, and he got rid of me and 
said, how are you, sonny? I'm telling you. Smacked

16:27.569 --> 16:29.531
him in the stomach. All

16:30.552 --> 16:35.156
kinds of pranks like this played. The worst thing 
they did was some of the vet boys if they were really

16:40.297 --> 16:43.081
in for somebody on the court. They'd take the 
genitals of the horse and put it on a plate and sit in

16:44.484 --> 16:51.375
front of him. Well, it was raunchy. Golly, it was 
raunchy. What kind of tricks did Aggies play in the

16:55.501 --> 17:01.872
dining hall in those days? You mentioned one or 
two. What about some others? Well, let me think.

17:07.043 --> 17:09.707
the making you carry things out. You know, a half a 
pound of milk in a little bottle would just fit in

17:10.307 --> 17:15.674
your sock. That would carry that out. You had to 
bring something out. You were detailed to bring

17:20.661 --> 17:22.504
something out. And if you didn't, it was pretty 
bad. But they get hard on you. But I guess the worst

17:28.011 --> 17:32.237
thing was the bird. Every time there was a girl, old 
boy had his girl down for the weekend, so he could

17:35.377 --> 17:43.208
depend on getting the bird some way. But that's 
about it. Outside of not having any kush, you had to

17:48.315 --> 17:58.228
get up at 4 Reveille and call them to attention, 
battalion attention, so many more days to kush. so

17:58.765 --> 18:00.287
that you could have some dessert. Well, we always 
had two old boys and a half that never could

18:00.327 --> 18:07.974
remember when that day would come, how many days. 
So we'd start over nearly about every week or ten

18:08.495 --> 18:14.961
days, we'd have to start over on counting the days.

18:17.864 --> 18:24.030
Let's see, what were the nicknames y'all gave to 
the various foods and drinks? See,

18:25.343 --> 18:44.270
cow

18:25.343 --> 18:44.270
was milk, wasn't it? Yes, cow was milk.

18:49.277 --> 18:50.018
Was bull neck Bullock was any kind of meat. You 
could have had any meat or been with somebody else.

19:00.400 --> 19:07.011
We would do anything to insult an upper class, in 
particular sophomores. We were detailed to

19:08.233 --> 19:10.297
insult a sophomore. Knowing full well we were 
going to pay for it later.

19:16.373 --> 19:26.405
We had one old boy with a great big butt on him, and he 
said something about blowing out your eyes, and

19:16.373 --> 19:26.405
Osama said, yeah, O2 is big enough, you know. There 
wasn't any place for cool heads out here in that

19:28.027 --> 19:31.671
time of day. Were there cush questions then? Cush 
questions. And I've heard some of the folks in a few

19:38.599 --> 19:45.908
years later, like one of the cush questions was how 
many stars are there in the Texas flag? And if you

19:46.175 --> 19:48.498
answered one, they said, no, there's two. There's 
one on each side. And if you said two, they'd say,

19:50.100 --> 19:52.083
no, there's one. It goes all the way through. I 
haven't heard that one. Well, that was another

19:54.746 --> 19:55.908
gimmick. If you couldn't answer the question the 
way they wanted you to, then you didn't get any

19:55.928 --> 20:00.293
kush. You didn't get any kush, that's right. Well, 
some people never got any kush until way up after

20:01.735 --> 20:05.781
Christmas. You see, all hazing was supposed to 
stop at Christmas. You were able to get two licks,

20:11.183 --> 20:14.307
Merry Christmas, and that was it. Well, because I 
never could get the meal formation on time, they

20:15.448 --> 20:22.357
didn't quit Christmas. I went home because I 
didn't want to sit down at all. Now, did you, you

20:28.525 --> 20:33.932
lived in that room over by the greenhouses all the 
time? All four years. Did you come over there to

20:35.314 --> 20:39.119
fall in for Morning Child? Everything. The whole 
thing? He got, I wouldn't think of asking him not

20:41.086 --> 20:47.015
to. I was behind the block of the dining hall 
entrance we went in.

20:54.265 --> 20:55.848
But I was gonna be in every formation. In fact, I was 
determined to be a good fish. And I worked at being a

21:01.156 --> 21:02.738
good fish. And I had a good time. I had more fun, I 
guess, as a freshman than anybody, because I

21:06.423 --> 21:09.608
didn't care. What

21:09.875 --> 21:19.332
was special about your outfit? Well, we were very, 
very military. Our company had won the Howe

21:23.760 --> 21:31.714
Trophy, best real company in the infantry the year 
before, and our captain company commander, Red

21:32.065 --> 21:38.633
Thompson from Throckmorton, was determined that 
we were going to win again, and we did. But we had an

21:39.433 --> 21:42.597
awful time with one fish. We had a fish named Fish 
Mill from Dallas, and he had been in ROTC in high

21:43.979 --> 22:00.958
school, and he thought he was the cock of the walk 
down there, that they could win that trophy

21:43.979 --> 22:00.958
without any help. We got all lined up, ready to go, 
and we looked over in the rear rank, and there's

22:01.563 --> 22:06.771
Fish Mills. He had had his whole uniform in the 
shower. He looked like the wrath of God. And so

22:14.884 --> 22:19.030
Ronnie Sorensen, our executive director, he's 
still there. I think he's still there. Wonderful

22:21.594 --> 22:23.617
person. And we looked back over there, and he said, 
you know, if he's absent, we'll lose less points

22:27.972 --> 22:32.677
than we'll do if he's here. So they sent him 
upstairs. And somebody put him in a waste paper

22:35.980 --> 22:40.324
basket in the room through there where he couldn't 
get away. And he had to watch it. We had two people

22:44.008 --> 22:47.892
absent, but we lost less points since they'd both 
been there. And anyway, we worked hard. And we were

22:53.257 --> 22:53.958
happy. We won the Al trophy. I think now they have 
another kind of a trophy for it. Describe a typical

23:01.507 --> 23:04.551
day of classes. What time did it begin? What was the 
routine for the day and so forth?

23:13.221 --> 23:14.903
Roughly, I had chemistry. What time did you get up 
normally? Oh, I'd get up around, we had to get up

23:17.046 --> 23:19.408
around six o'clock. We went to bed with the bugle, 
got up with the bugle. I would have, I had chemistry

23:25.465 --> 23:32.191
lecture in Claycross Hall at the gym. I had PE, and 
I'd run over that way to PE and then run back to

23:32.211 --> 23:38.316
English. And let me see, what else did I, we were, I 
was either in class or at work

23:39.517 --> 23:51.628
six, let's see, nine hours a day. And that's when 
they, when they got through, when they,

23:55.807 --> 23:56.908
everything tabled up. They said, well, you've 
worked more than half time, so you get five years in

23:56.928 --> 24:08.503
mass credit and social security, which is all 
right with me. What did you do after Evening Chow?

24:15.011 --> 24:18.576
Well, you went back to the company.

24:22.701 --> 24:25.084
I'm not sure that I remember what we did after 
Evening Chow. I said we had We all were in some kind

24:26.367 --> 24:31.275
of a bull session with the upperclassmen. We had 
twin, identical twins in our outfit, the Mountain

24:32.176 --> 24:39.227
Brothers. Freddie was a freshman. They were from 
Calvert, Parker and Gilson. And they had a long

24:44.915 --> 24:47.299
suit the first week or two. And they'd park one on 
the first floor and one on the second floor. And

24:51.666 --> 24:54.450
you'd walk in and the second floor would say, 
hello, Mr. Napp. Who the hell are you, freshman? I

24:56.250 --> 24:57.472
never saw you before in my life. They were 
identical to us, and we didn't know it. And I did

25:02.439 --> 25:06.666
know one from the other. But they were a good body. 
They moved to the Valley and ran a Chevrolet

25:08.669 --> 25:14.999
company down there. What did you wear to class? 
Describe the uniforms of the 1930s. Well, we wore

25:21.749 --> 25:23.712
just khaki pants that were scratched, and wool 
shirts that were bad. They were all

25:31.155 --> 25:32.617
government-issued stuff. And the blouse had blue 
lapel on them, because that meant you were two

25:33.618 --> 25:42.086
years, first two years in the military. Then you 
bought your stuff in junior, senior year, if you

25:42.106 --> 25:48.552
were taking advanced military. But it was just 
very plain and coarse and rough. Scratchy. All

25:56.159 --> 25:58.883
right, what about for ceremonies? What did you all 
wear for reviews and so forth? Freshman and

26:02.328 --> 26:08.297
sophomore wore the blouses with the blue lapels as 
non-contractors. When you got to be juniors and

26:08.317 --> 26:21.998
seniors, you bought your own, and you had the 
regular dress shirts, pink pants, and Sam Brown

26:08.317 --> 26:21.998
belt, and a regular old hat. We didn't get the caps. 
I don't think we got caps until the Corps took a real

26:24.308 --> 26:26.870
late. What about some of the pranks, jokes, good 
bull that Aggies played on each other? Well, of

26:37.121 --> 26:40.045
course, everybody got drowned out one or two 
times. One time I borrowed a hose from the

26:41.306 --> 26:47.212
greenhouse and took it over and put it on the third 
floor and turned it loose. And it just looked like

26:48.354 --> 26:51.377
Niagara Falls coming down the steps. Gaga 
Commons, I don't know his first name. We called him

26:57.248 --> 26:58.069
Gaga. He was a fifth-year senior. And he decided he 
would haze me one night. And he took a baseball bat

27:04.739 --> 27:08.544
and hit me so hard. I said, I'm about to go back up 
there. I just kept on going down the steps. And I

27:13.008 --> 27:14.110
left him. And then I lived literally in that 
greenhouse area to take care of at night. The bunch

27:22.020 --> 27:28.409
of boys soon found out that they'd come running 
down that road and come into the greenhouse and

27:22.020 --> 27:28.409
crawl around the benches and stay there. So they 
did. And

27:29.671 --> 27:36.380
I thought Mr. Hinton might object, but he didn't. 
He wasn't for hazing anyway. So he didn't object to

27:38.763 --> 27:40.045
that. Did y'all steal anybody's footlocker, any 
of your CO's footlocker? No. Didn't? We didn't do

27:47.984 --> 27:50.487
that kind of pranks. We had one, I'll never forget, 
Lord have mercy. Across the street from Hart is

27:55.555 --> 27:58.379
Goodwin. I don't know if it's still there or not. 
But they had big furnaces in it, and every night the

28:00.462 --> 28:05.770
chimney suits would come in by the droves. And we 
had a senior... A. Gibb Trimley,

28:08.375 --> 28:14.325
T-R-I-M-B-L-E-Y, who was a major on the Corps 
staff. Well, you couldn't touch him with a 10-foot

28:15.146 --> 28:17.490
pole. So one night, somebody detailed us just to 
fix him up. So we caught about two or three sacks of

28:23.840 --> 28:28.307
those stinking chimneysweeps. And we didn't open 
the door, knock on the door, and walk in and dump

28:29.030 --> 28:33.176
them in your room. You have never seen such a mess in 
your life. Of course, we had to clean it all up. And

28:40.506 --> 28:42.008
you know about ratting the rooms. Just drive it, 
please. All right. The sophomore was having a

28:46.314 --> 28:50.500
class meeting. And while they were gone, we were 
supposed to take their room apart. And we didn't

28:55.675 --> 29:02.283
know what taking a room apart was until we had our 
class meeting. And they took our room apart. They

29:05.446 --> 29:06.988
even took the bed springs apart. We actually never 
got that thing put back together. But when we—that

29:09.271 --> 29:14.177
was called ratting the rooms. And you took it apart 
like you couldn't believe. And Hart Hall was lucky

29:17.596 --> 29:23.605
to have a blazed tile. We didn't quite tear it up. 
But you know, we had to put up a room to buy it. And I

29:29.634 --> 29:32.458
put up a room to buy it and ran into that room over the 
greenhouse. Because this is as darned to a room.

29:35.683 --> 29:40.250
But...

29:40.831 --> 29:42.253
Describe that... You put up a room to put it, but 
nobody ever got a room to put it back. There was much

29:47.387 --> 29:49.872
damage done to the dormitory during the year. They 
used all that money and then some to put it back

29:50.393 --> 29:53.239
together. Describe that room you lived in over by 
the greenhouse. What was in it? How big was it? It

29:59.390 --> 30:05.963
was just big enough to get a bunk bed and one end of 
it. And it was a regular bunk bed, and we had just

30:06.432 --> 30:15.667
plain old planks put together for a closet in there 
and a desk. And that was all. I didn't have a bath. I

30:18.692 --> 30:20.995
had to go a half block up a street. I wish I could 
remember the dormitory's name. You'll have to get

30:24.421 --> 30:26.464
it for me. And I'd take a bath. There was a field 
artillery there, and I was an infantry freshman

30:28.267 --> 30:31.933
that nobody knew. And I'd go up to this old boy's 
room I knew in class and take a bath. Finally, I

30:36.525 --> 30:52.544
finally got a—I had a commode—finally got a

30:36.525 --> 30:52.544
shower in there, and it was water you turned steam 
in to get it hot. Of course, you had to be careful you

30:52.564 --> 30:55.467
didn't scald yourself. Anyway, we finally got 
that—I guess my senior year.

31:01.816 --> 31:07.685
The, how did things change for you as a sophomore? 
How was life different? Well, I didn't believe in

31:10.289 --> 31:13.574
hazing freshmen, so I didn't haze any fish. I never 
did haze any fish. And I, well, of course, I didn't,

31:17.079 --> 31:26.394
you didn't have much trouble during sophomore. If 
you'd been a good fish and which I tried to do. I did

31:31.867 --> 31:34.932
have a corporal rank, even though I lived clear 
over there. That's because of, I guess, of what I

31:35.894 --> 31:39.479
did in the company. And also because I liked 
military. But change didn't take very much for me.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.436
I was a squad leader. That gave me some more 
training. And then when I started to be in the

31:53.212 --> 32:04.923
junior year, they decided I was a day student 
instead of a dormitory student, even though I paid

31:53.212 --> 32:04.923
dormitory rent. So I decided I was a day student, 
and they were going to put all the day students in

32:04.943 --> 32:11.130
one outfit. So they had three companies, a 
headquarters, a headquarters second time,

32:11.150 --> 32:18.617
headquarters third time, Anyway, there were 
three day companies, and one of my very best

32:19.238 --> 32:33.112
friends who was filing with us at the Experiment 
Station,

32:19.238 --> 32:33.112
Tom, wait a minute, I forgot his name. Anyway, 
there were three day companies, and we all had a

32:33.872 --> 32:40.219
company. I was the first sergeant of one, and Tom 
McMillan, I was sergeant one, and I forget who the

32:44.939 --> 32:48.224
other one was. Anyway, we had, for three years, we 
had day student companies. Even though I stayed in

32:52.791 --> 33:01.445
that room and paid rural dormitory rent, because I 
didn't live in the dorms per se, I was considered a

32:52.791 --> 33:01.445
day student. Did you live in that room over the 
greenhouse all four years? All four years. I had

33:07.254 --> 33:13.343
the responsibility

33:07.254 --> 33:13.343
of not, well, seeing the heat and ventilation was 
done on the greenhouse, and all we had for heat was

33:13.947 --> 33:23.198
cutting steam, live steam, into cold water again. 
Hot water system, which is a good system. It's a

33:25.441 --> 33:31.108
good level system, even temperature, until you 
boiled it all over and started over again. And I

33:31.889 --> 33:36.495
took care of the greenhouse and ventilation. But I 
would have to go from that room, clear the hard

33:36.813 --> 33:42.886
hall, to make meal formations. And that's why many 
times they'd catch me about selling when they

33:42.906 --> 33:50.462
played to the colors, and I'd have to stop and 
salute. And then by the time I got to that, They were

33:53.587 --> 33:56.853
already here in Squad Z and going to the time 
missile. And that's what those two sophomores

33:57.414 --> 34:00.339
equipped me for. I was never on time for formation. 
And when the company commander finally called

34:03.265 --> 34:06.931
away, I was free. As you began your courses as a 
freshman, What were some of the most memorable

34:14.393 --> 34:17.679
courses that you took? The only course I liked, I 
had two of them. I liked botany and entomology.

34:29.547 --> 34:32.310
I made an A-plus on the final exam in entomology. 
I'll never forget that, because the doctor, the

34:33.872 --> 34:37.136
teacher wouldn't believe me. He said, I can't 
believe that you know the names, the names of all

34:37.156 --> 34:42.142
these insects. I said, well, that's what you 
taught us, you know. And that was, I loved

34:45.686 --> 34:49.991
entomology and I loved botany. And of course you 
took all that, you took government and history and

34:50.832 --> 34:55.858
English and I enjoyed my course, and of course we 
had a brand new man out of West Point, Captain

34:57.543 --> 35:06.754
Moses, Lieutenant Moses. He was promoted our 
junior year, I believe, to captain as a military

35:06.774 --> 35:14.724
instructor. And he was captured by the active 
baton. He was with a bunch of gorillas. and

35:27.935 --> 35:30.638
somebody squealed on him, and they captured him 
and shot him. But he was an awfully good officer.

35:35.323 --> 35:38.927
Who were some of the other fine teachers you had 
during those four years?

35:42.651 --> 35:43.532
Let me think a minute. I took all the history of 
architecture I could take. I took four courses

35:47.597 --> 35:56.507
under Charles Mattoon Brooks.

35:56.858 --> 36:00.884
very slight built young man, but he was an 
excellent teacher. And I liked the history of

36:01.484 --> 36:03.227
architecture much. We didn't have history of 
landscape architecture. So I took every course in

36:06.551 --> 36:11.418
history he had and loved them all. And then

36:12.360 --> 36:19.549
Dr. Adriens and Mr. Bryson in horticulture. Mr. 
Bryson was an excellent teacher and later a

36:20.891 --> 36:25.718
friend, and I went back. And

36:26.525 --> 36:30.549
I can't think of who else. Of course, chemistry 
didn't take on me. I made a D and an E in chemistry. Do

36:39.660 --> 36:40.941
you remember who the teacher was? Dr. Potts. Did he 
have a nickname? No, that's Dr. Potts. Later, when

36:49.897 --> 36:54.883
I was back at A&M on staff, Dick Fox was there. This 
man, I had a lecture. We had the big lecture hall at 8

36:57.906 --> 37:03.512
o'clock in the morning. I did. And then we held the 
two labs. But I didn't have any high school

37:09.119 --> 37:13.443
chemistry or anything like that. The chemistry 
just didn't take on me. I made a D the first

37:16.146 --> 37:17.608
semester. And E the second semester. And E meant 
that if you take a D quiz at the beginning of the next

37:20.611 --> 37:29.562
semester and make a C, no, make a D, it would be your 
grade. So I got two Ds in freshman chemistry. And I

37:33.346 --> 37:34.728
didn't take ag chemistry. I'd never gotten out of 
A&M. What about English? I enjoyed English very

37:40.394 --> 37:41.896
much. Who? I had good English teachers in high 
school.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.123
He coached the debate team, and I can't remember. I

37:51.143 --> 37:56.409
don't remember my English teacher's name. 
History? Did you have any American history,

37:57.650 --> 38:01.015
European history? You know, I can't remember 
their names. I took 12 hours of education as

38:05.019 --> 38:11.407
electives, and it came in handy later. Who did you 
turn to for advice and counsel if you needed... Who

38:19.402 --> 38:21.425
was your favorite advisor? We didn't know what an 
advisor was back in those days. If

38:25.751 --> 38:35.585
you made 35 grade points your freshman year, you 
could take extra work. And in spite of my two D's, I

38:35.605 --> 38:39.811
had 35 grade points. So I said, well, I came here to 
go to school. So I took, I was either in class or at

38:44.437 --> 38:48.042
work. 9 hours a day. And I didn't have time for 
anything else. All the requirement was that if you

38:58.382 --> 39:02.848
made 35 grade points, you'd take extra work. And I 
didn't ask them how much, I just took it. And I'd

39:05.591 --> 39:09.396
take 40 hours, and one of them a year, I took 44 
hours. Didn't ask anybody, didn't tell anybody.

39:11.638 --> 39:14.502
Took it and made the best grade you ever made. uh the 
what were the the what was the the rules or the

39:16.017 --> 39:38.278
typical pattern of behavior in class when you all 
went to class what you were you act like gentlemen

39:16.017 --> 39:38.278
you stayed there there was no disturbance uh when 
the when the military The professor walked in, he

39:38.495 --> 39:41.279
stood at attention until he said, at ease. No, 
there was no food around. It was all business. Did

39:47.488 --> 39:48.930
you ever go to sleep in class? I probably did, but I 
don't remember when or what. They were usually

39:56.081 --> 39:58.965
pretty interesting all the way. We had several 
things happen that were really interesting. They

40:01.950 --> 40:04.333
were in 1934.

40:06.068 --> 40:08.432
Anybody told you about the Federal Transit Bureau 
yet?

40:11.457 --> 40:20.833
Well, in the fall of 34, sometime during 34, the 
young men were hobos riding the rails all over the

40:11.457 --> 40:20.833
country. So somebody decided that they ought to be 
in college, so the government will set up a program

40:20.853 --> 40:29.387
called the Federal Transit Bureau, and they'll 
take these kids and put them in school. Lord have

40:31.470 --> 40:32.532
mercy. They put them in Old Ross Hall, the worst 
dormitory on the campus, and it was four to the room

40:33.153 --> 40:45.594
and horrible showers and cottages. That was the 
year that at midterm you could buy any file on

40:46.515 --> 40:53.507
campus because these boys knew them. They'd break 
in and get them, and they had them. And the only way

40:57.722 --> 41:06.318
they discovered was the head of the history 
department went back one night to the office, and

40:57.722 --> 41:06.318
when he opened the door, somebody jumped out the 
second story window. And the next day, across that

41:08.161 --> 41:15.495
free between the second and first floor, seeing, 
seeing on the radars in red paint.

41:18.445 --> 41:22.329
But that only lasted a very short time. Those kids 
were stealing of all the final exams. And anybody

41:27.234 --> 41:30.437
could buy a final exam if they had the money and the 
price they wanted. Do you remember what the price

41:30.457 --> 41:31.758
was? Well, the standard price of anything was $5. 
And then if you wanted more, they'd get more. But I

41:40.207 --> 41:47.794
think at midterm that year, every final exam on 
campus would circulate. So they got rid of that

41:48.196 --> 41:50.779
bunch in the last long. One man stayed, Stephen E. 
Sackash, S-A-C-K-A-S-H. Steve was a real good

41:51.781 --> 42:06.300
friend of mine, and he was going to get out. He's the 
only one I knew that finished that bunch. He didn't

42:12.580 --> 42:15.323
have any clothes, he didn't have any uniform, 
anything. So I stayed for a graduate year, one year

42:16.084 --> 42:27.217
of graduate work, and I gave him, I had worn the 
soles of my boots three times, so I gave him my whole

42:16.084 --> 42:27.217
uniform. And he wore it with pride all day. But 
that's about all the clothes he had. And anyway,

42:31.562 --> 42:36.327
let's see. Oh, that was also the time that we came 
into, it was during this time that we,

42:37.117 --> 42:55.252
who was president, I can't think of his name. I say 
that's before Walton, isn't it? No, this is well

42:58.555 --> 43:00.076
after Walton. Oh. I can get you to stir it on Walton, 
too. This was the... The highway, director of the

43:07.559 --> 43:09.501
highway. Oh, Gilchrist. Gilchrist came, and 
Gilchrist brought, Gilchrist established the

43:12.865 --> 43:20.813
roadside beautification program. He brought a 
man named Jack Gubbels, G-U-B-B-E-L-S,

43:21.854 --> 43:35.068
over with his bride, and he set up the roadside 
beautification program, and he wrote a book

43:21.854 --> 43:35.068
called called American Highways and Roadsides, 
published in 38. And I had a copy. And Lady Bird

43:41.817 --> 43:44.160
Johnson came over to the university. And I asked 
the president to give it to her. And he said, no, you

43:46.745 --> 43:48.127
give it to her. That was Jack Williams. He said, you 
give it to her. And she said, I've been trying to

43:51.933 --> 43:54.196
find this book for years. And I said, well, you can 
certainly have that one. And so it's in her library

43:57.593 --> 43:59.475
there. Oh, how nice. But then when Walter became 
president, I'm not sure about the background on

44:01.817 --> 44:12.386
this and when he became president, but it must have 
been in the early 30s. Because when he went to the

44:13.667 --> 44:26.858
president's home, as I understand it back there, 
the highest

44:13.667 --> 44:26.858
rank on campus was director of the Experiment 
Station. That was prior to 30. Anyway, when the

44:34.045 --> 44:48.025
director of the Experiment Station,

44:34.045 --> 44:48.025
they decided that they needed a president, they 
got Walton, who was at that time director of the

44:34.045 --> 44:48.025
Experiment Station. And his, her, or Ms. Walton 
came there And her father was named Turner, and he

44:55.272 --> 45:00.777
lived in Mount Enterprise. And he decided that she 
had to have some help. So he gave her two servants,

45:05.661 --> 45:13.387
Willie Phillips and Manny McKaney, 
M-C-K-A-N-E-Y. And they were there. I knew both of

45:18.252 --> 45:19.693
them real well. And where they stayed, I don't 
know, because this was before the time of domestic

45:20.474 --> 45:24.537
health. Segregation. But he said there was two 
down there. As far as you know, did they live on the

45:29.464 --> 45:33.010
campus? They lived somewhere on the campus. I had 
backdoor privileges. That's another tale. Mr.

45:42.484 --> 45:46.590
Hensel took me over there my freshman year. He 
said, Ms. Walden, this is Robert Rucker, and

45:47.431 --> 45:52.819
anytime you need flowers, you just call him. I 
never put a fly in a bowl in my life. And I didn't know

45:56.717 --> 45:57.998
where to get any. He said, now, you can cut anything 
you have on the campus. And if you ever need

46:02.044 --> 46:06.089
anything special, let me know, and we'll buy some. 
So that's the way it was. Anyway, I came out of the,

46:09.713 --> 46:16.742
I'd just go in the back door of the president's 
home, and I wouldn't dare tell a sophomore. They'd

46:16.762 --> 46:20.427
beat the hell out of me with their head. I'd go in, 
and I had backdoor privilege at the practice home,

46:21.622 --> 46:34.901
and I remember I'd tell Maddie, could I, Maddie 
would offer me a piece of pie, and I said, I'd like a

46:21.622 --> 46:34.901
cup of coffee. Freshmen don't have to use a drink of 
coffee. I'll give you some milk. She wouldn't give

46:38.946 --> 46:40.629
me a cup of coffee at all. But there were loads full 
of flower beds across the, driveway from the

46:45.567 --> 46:47.109
president's home. And I took care of those flower 
beds. And whatever we had, we planted. But to get

46:52.576 --> 47:00.006
things for the table, I could cut anything I could 
find just so I didn't use a scratcher doing it. And

47:00.687 --> 47:04.352
we finally got some to grow a few flowers for her.
