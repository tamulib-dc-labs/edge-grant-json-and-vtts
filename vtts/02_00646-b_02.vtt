03:16.827 --> 03:23.733
We'd like for you to make some comments, if you 
would please, on what George McGinney did in

03:16.827 --> 03:23.733
ecology.

03:26.375 --> 03:39.727
George McGinney was, I believe, one of the first 
pure scientist marine ecologists in the world. I

03:41.388 --> 03:46.733
think that Peterson in Denmark was certainly an 
ecologist, but he was motivated by fishery

03:47.590 --> 03:58.540
concerns and did some very nice work. But George 
McGinnity, who is still alive, I heard just the

03:58.600 --> 04:17.277
other day, did

03:58.600 --> 04:17.277
some very nice work on the ecology of some of our 
estuarine conditions in California and on the

04:17.763 --> 04:23.589
West Coast in general. He tried to bring together 
all of the environmental factors, including the

04:26.132 --> 04:43.990
biological, that were controlling

04:26.132 --> 04:43.990
the ecosystems, although he did not call them 
ecosystems, in these estuarine areas. for the

04:45.117 --> 04:56.493
first time, and I think that he had a grasp of this 
that was admirable in his time. He doesn't fare

04:57.835 --> 05:11.395
well now because of the fact that things have 
progressed on into systems analysis and so on, and

04:57.835 --> 05:11.395
he had no respect for the attempts of biologists to 
become engineers. So he's not as well received now

05:17.734 --> 05:23.240
as he was in the past. But he was a pioneer, I would 
say, in his field. You know where he lives now? I am

05:31.629 --> 05:32.530
not certain. I surmise it is in Puget Sound region 
somewhere. I would say possibly. in the Friday

05:40.417 --> 05:42.539
Harbor region. His wife, Nettie McGinnity, they 
have published together. They've put out two or

05:48.967 --> 05:50.829
three books. So he is a real pioneer and would be, if 
he could be located, oh, Joel Hedgepath would know

05:52.190 --> 06:01.120
where he is. Just ask Joel, and you might want to 
give him a call or something. This is a quote,

06:10.387 --> 06:11.789
really. There was a good deal of dissension in the 
department and a resistance to merging the

06:12.249 --> 06:18.958
disciplines. Was there the same sort of problems 
at Scripps when Scripps was created, dissension

06:20.120 --> 06:33.618
in the department and merging of disciplines to 
create a department of oceanography?

06:33.638 --> 06:36.141
I've forgotten the context of this now. Actually, 
you're talking about what I suspect is political

06:36.560 --> 06:52.219
infighting here at Texas A&M concerning a 
disagreement over exactly how the structure or

06:36.560 --> 06:52.219
role of oceanography should play in the creating 
of an academic discipline.

06:52.239 --> 06:53.861
Yeah. However, right today, that doesn't ring the 
soapbox response that I might have given. I don't

07:03.413 --> 07:05.115
really know. just what we're talking about on the 
infighting. Well, what we're really concerned

07:08.355 --> 07:31.018
about is that when you create a discipline of 
oceanography, something that's really you can't

07:08.355 --> 07:31.018
create, I suspect, but when you do this and you 
begin to merge the disciplines and have

07:08.355 --> 07:31.018
overlapping responsibilities in terms of 
academicians, is this a constant problem

07:08.355 --> 07:31.018
wherever you've been, at Scripps, at NYU, here at 
A&M, or is this unusual to occur? No, I had best

07:33.395 --> 07:36.700
demur on that. I really can't come up with the lead. 
Maybe it'll come out in a moment. But right at the

07:42.449 --> 07:45.494
moment, I don't really see. Now, there were some 
squabblings going on among representatives of

07:45.534 --> 07:51.904
the disciplines. And clearly, there's always 
been the feeling that physical oceanography was

07:52.725 --> 08:01.258
the real oceanography, that the other things were 
simply tacked on in order to round out a curriculum

08:01.593 --> 08:07.619
to give enough for a degree program. And possibly 
this is the kind of thing I had in the back of my mind.

08:13.245 --> 08:15.187
I know this has been true. But invariably, so far as 
I am aware, the biologists have always won out. And

08:23.937 --> 08:29.102
the reason they've won out is that the others have 
come to them eventually with something that

08:29.639 --> 08:36.107
interests them about their field that applies to 
biology. And I don't say that with any feeling of

08:36.948 --> 08:42.855
superiority, but really truthfully so. I'm 
making up a proposal right now to discuss the

08:43.796 --> 08:59.275
potential of disposal of dredge material in the 
open ocean and what effects it's going to have.

08:59.963 --> 09:17.759
Okay, I have brought in a chemical oceanographer, 
and the reason I brought this one in is that he

08:59.963 --> 09:17.759
became very interested in biological phenomena 
in relationship to the transfer of trace metals in

08:59.963 --> 09:17.759
the marine environment. I brought in a physical 
oceanographer because he's particularly

09:17.779 --> 09:27.928
interested in the relationship of currents to 
biological phenomena in the sea, and so am I. These

09:28.516 --> 09:32.181
people have expressed this interest on their own. 
I have not motivated it, but because of this, I find

09:32.302 --> 09:41.235
a pleasant working liaison among these parts of 
the discipline. And at the same time, geology is

09:42.537 --> 09:51.610
clearly interrelated with my feeling about the 
need to understand that and the distribution of

09:42.537 --> 09:51.610
bottom organisms. So I think, as is originally 
espoused, by Roger Revelle and his colleagues,

09:57.946 --> 10:04.452
cohorts, and so on. The real oceanography was the 
physical. And these others just were added on to

10:09.016 --> 10:20.286
justify giving a curriculum.

10:21.607 --> 10:23.408
So there could be a little battle around there. And 
it still goes on at A&M a little bit. But it's not

10:28.102 --> 10:29.924
serious. The most serious thing is we can't find a 
department

10:29.944 --> 10:36.552
head. Listen, we just got through with that. You 
did? Yes. I'm interested in... You'll have to

10:40.877 --> 10:43.901
explain that later. I'm interested in your

10:44.281 --> 10:56.556
academia, UCLA, Pomona, Chicago, Caltech, 
Sunny, A&M, your work for the vitamin company,

10:44.281 --> 10:56.556
Terrico, government, quasi-government, NSF. 
Has there been a deliberate attempt in your life to

10:58.750 --> 11:04.578
mix all of these together, or has one just sort of 
led to another? I mean, have you tried to broaden

11:05.360 --> 11:11.909
yourself outside of the academic world to include 
all of these, or did you just do that accidentally?

11:15.214 --> 11:19.040
No, not entirely accidentally. I have... been my 
worst enemy in many ways because I have gone where

11:26.135 --> 11:55.922
my interests have taken me and have not adhered to a 
single line which would have perhaps made me much

11:26.135 --> 11:55.922
more acceptable in the public eye but I have often 
taken the unpopular side of things and it is

11:26.135 --> 11:55.922
because I feel that that the scientist does have an 
obligation to translate his findings into useful

11:56.138 --> 12:04.106
information for the public. And the public 
includes here anybody that's not a scientist. And

12:09.992 --> 12:13.856
indeed, it includes anybody that's not a 
scientist in his field. And so I have felt that it

12:15.077 --> 12:26.128
was not only, in a sense, an obligation of the 
scientist to provide the basis for the technology

12:26.800 --> 12:48.008
that made products that society wanted, but it was 
also necessary for the scientists to attempt to

12:26.800 --> 12:48.008
find ways to solve the problems of the byproducts 
of these things that were dangerous to the

12:26.800 --> 12:48.008
environment. And so all the way through, I have 
tried not to condemn what industry was doing, say,

12:54.813 --> 13:09.628
to the marine environment so much as to find ways to 
solve the problem to make what they were doing less

12:54.813 --> 13:09.628
damaging to the marine environment. And so it has 
been with most of the endeavors that I've

13:09.648 --> 13:18.337
undertaken. Now, I like new challenges. And in 
part, that was the reason I was attracted when

13:24.209 --> 13:35.304
Robert Maynard Hutchins gave me an invitation to 
go to Chicago, to go there. But as I told you before,

13:36.366 --> 13:48.342
my somatic self couldn't keep up with my 
intellectual self, and I couldn't stand the damn

13:36.366 --> 13:48.342
winters. So I left there, and When I was at NSF,

13:53.167 --> 14:15.870
I

13:53.167 --> 14:15.870
was approached by the new president of a new 
university forming, State University of New

13:53.167 --> 14:15.870
York, which was then at Oyster Bay and was moving to 
Stony Brook. And he outlined such a fantastically

14:20.791 --> 14:25.899
interesting development that I went there for 
that challenge. But as I say, when I saw it was a

14:25.919 --> 14:31.649
political morass, I left. It was a very 
disappointing short endeavor. Caltech was a

14:36.096 --> 14:46.393
tremendous opportunity for me because it 
permitted me to be at a marine laboratory, a very

14:36.096 --> 14:46.393
small but very well run and very well kept up marine 
laboratory at Krona Del Mar, California. And so I

14:54.054 --> 14:56.457
went there for that reason. And Pomona was a very 
difficult intellectual area

14:56.598 --> 15:14.845
to leave because it was really a delightful 
experience. I should have left 10 years before I

15:15.280 --> 15:27.777
did, because one does not develop in this field as 
well there as you can in other areas. And I perhaps

15:27.797 --> 15:29.580
stayed too long there. But it was a pleasant place. 
Environmentally, it became unsound. I feel sorry

15:36.429 --> 15:43.279
for people that have to live in that smog out there 
east of Los Angeles today. So I guess that kind of

15:44.828 --> 15:47.872
explains it. It's a long way around. I don't think 
you ever exactly said why the president of Stony

15:49.094 --> 15:53.480
Brook was fired. I don't really know. I don't 
really know, and that was part of it. It was, I

15:58.047 --> 16:12.507
think, because of fright on the part of those that 
had been there that he was attempting to make too

15:58.047 --> 16:12.507
many changes too fast, and they felt insecure. And 
they began to find ways and means of trapping him

16:13.027 --> 16:26.646
into saying things that were not acceptable to 
some of the board of directors, I guess they called

16:13.027 --> 16:26.646
it there. But that is the only thing that I know. 
He's

16:31.473 --> 16:38.403
in the Washington area somewhere now. I've sort of 
lost track of him. But he was an exciting person.

16:42.271 --> 16:49.437
speaker, and he was a statistical 
thermodynamicist and was really well trained.

16:51.139 --> 16:57.124
And he had a tremendous interest in engineering 
and biology. He was a fascinating individual. I

17:01.028 --> 17:07.674
think Stony Brook would have gone well beyond 
where it did in the early days. It was held up a long

17:07.774 --> 17:09.515
time because of that. But it got some good men later 
on, of course. to direct it. Really good people. So

17:16.396 --> 17:17.017
it caught up. It's one of the great schools now, I 
think. In discussing the Carnegie Conference,

17:21.925 --> 17:33.744
you stated that you were chosen to lead the 
symposium largely because of certain things that

17:21.925 --> 17:33.744
I had done, pre-medical education, and that sort 
of thing. Yeah. What pre-medical education?

17:41.772 --> 17:47.160
Following the Second World War, there was a 
resurgent interest in medicine. And as a

17:48.522 --> 17:57.194
consequence of this, there was a demand for 
high-quality students. And Pomona certainly had

17:57.214 --> 18:00.579
high-quality students. And yet, it was sometimes 
difficult for these students to be evaluated

18:01.541 --> 18:10.193
properly from a small college as compared to those 
who came from the university scene. As a

18:16.179 --> 18:36.130
consequence of this, I tried to devise ways that we 
could convey rather accurately the worth of a

18:16.179 --> 18:36.130
student beyond the simple medical aptitude test 
and so on that they took, and to at least

18:16.179 --> 18:36.130
preliminarily screen them so that they would be 
eligible for interview by deans or assistant

18:36.498 --> 18:40.922
deans of the medical schools. And we wanted to get 
them into the best of the medical schools. As a

18:46.167 --> 19:06.167
consequence, I began to attend national 
conferences on this pre-medical education and

18:46.167 --> 19:06.167
then devised ways and means of dealing with the 
students, of preparing necessary

18:46.167 --> 19:06.167
recommendations and so on, and got caught up in 
this so that I was actually invited to sit on the

19:06.620 --> 19:19.551
admissions committee of the University of 
Southern California Medical School. And

19:20.712 --> 19:27.598
I was really quite intrigued by that. I had 
considered going into medicine myself, and so I

19:27.819 --> 19:35.125
was intrigued by it. I don't know whether I 
answered your question or not. Now, you also

19:41.791 --> 19:58.727
mentioned some work in agriculture that you did, 
some education in agriculture, and I could

19:41.791 --> 19:58.727
not—you

19:41.791 --> 19:58.727
said that when you—one of the earliest people to be 
educated in this sort of specialization of— Oh.

20:01.590 --> 20:05.133
No, I think perhaps at Berkeley, was it? At 
Berkeley. No, it turned out that a lot of the

20:06.323 --> 20:21.201
courses that I wanted to take were given in the 
College of Agriculture, including soil science,

20:06.323 --> 20:21.201
which was really a going thing when I was going to 
college. And so I moved through a series of

20:22.122 --> 20:35.098
colleges, actually, while at Berkeley in a very 
short period of time. And took a lot of courses

20:35.821 --> 20:42.890
there in genetics, for example, that are still 
here given in agriculture. But I really am not sure

20:42.930 --> 20:48.616
of the context. I should have read my notes over. 
No, that's fine. You also mentioned something

20:51.640 --> 20:55.324
called, is it Fraber Shrimpers? F-R-A-B-E-R?

21:00.731 --> 21:01.692
Fraber Shrimpers? Mm-hmm. Do you know? I didn't 
know. That's what I got from the interview all the

21:06.027 --> 21:08.090
time. It didn't make any sense to me. Well, I 
listened to the tape. It had to do with... You don't

21:10.532 --> 21:15.458
know anything about the context, eh? You were just 
talking about the sort of... one particular sort

21:16.660 --> 21:22.787
of vessel that appeared. And it sounded as if the 
word you used was freighter-shrimpers. Or

21:26.552 --> 21:27.293
freighter, maybe. Or maybe it was a 
freighter-shrimper.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.160
Oh. This wasn't in regard to the... to the 
Alaminos, was it? It was? Well, that was an FS. It

21:44.119 --> 21:47.563
was an Army FS class freighter. It was a modified FS 
freighter. That was a class of ships that the Army

21:58.542 --> 22:02.386
ran during the Second World War, and I believe that 
must be what that was. That's correct. FS class.

22:04.789 --> 22:06.191
That was puzzling. Right. Now, I want to ask one 
question hinted at in this first interview

22:06.991 --> 22:14.520
concerning women and discrimination in science. 
Does it seem to you that women entering the

22:17.023 --> 22:24.471
scientific field face discrimination based upon 
sex? If you're talking about science generally, i

22:28.478 --> 22:56.899
would have to say yes i think so not much doubt in my 
mind i think this is somewhat regional and i think

22:28.478 --> 22:56.899
it is somewhat related to school size and so on i i 
feel that in the undergraduate level no but at the

22:28.478 --> 22:56.899
graduate level yes and i think uh particularly 
among people of my age that have been

22:57.048 --> 23:09.301
disillusioned by having students go through and 
then take a degree and do nothing more with it. But

23:09.942 --> 23:17.430
that's passing, for sure, because women aren't 
doing that to the same extent anymore. So I think

23:17.510 --> 23:19.111
that thing is gone. In oceanography, even yet 
today, there is genuine... discrimination in

23:25.853 --> 23:42.695
some ways, that we accept girls and so on, but 
there's always that latent feeling that there's

23:25.853 --> 23:42.695
such a nuisance on board ship and that sort of 
thing, you know, so you do get it. I think that this

23:43.576 --> 23:53.008
is passing without much doubt, but certainly some 
that have not been as many women leaders in science

23:54.389 --> 23:58.613
as there perhaps should have been.

24:02.618 --> 24:05.220
For the reason that they were discouraged at some 
point. Now, we have a series of sort of

24:06.582 --> 24:15.451
semi-technical questions that I'd like for Monty 
to ask you concerning some attitudes towards

24:06.582 --> 24:15.451
science that you have. One of the questions I have 
is, in the first interview you talked about

24:17.273 --> 24:24.160
analytical specialism. time you're going to 
university it was in sway but by the uh by the 40s the

24:24.815 --> 24:54.433
people began to realize that the analytical this 
is a quote analytical approach to science was no

24:24.815 --> 24:54.433
longer going to work now i'm not sure i understand 
what you mean by that isn't the scientific method

24:24.815 --> 24:54.433
necessarily analytical would you perhaps you 
better define and then explain how it isn't going

24:24.815 --> 24:54.433
to work and why well it's kind of difficult for you 
to understand that today because the same feeling

24:54.700 --> 24:56.182
really doesn't hold. We talk about analysis and 
synthesis today and use them very freely and so on,

24:56.843 --> 25:21.096
but if you look at it over a long horizon of time, you 
realize that man's mind was searching for the

24:56.843 --> 25:21.096
ultimate answer to what life is all about and what 
is life, and as a consequence it was Wouldn't it be

25:21.667 --> 25:27.634
the natural thing to pull things apart, to look 
inside? After the medieval period, this

25:29.056 --> 25:32.920
certainly was true. Instead of talking about it, 
you looked at it. And of course, in the Grecian

25:37.285 --> 25:40.869
period, they had done the same thing. They had 
looked at it, but a lot of that stuff got lost.

25:47.738 --> 25:55.345
Although that seems like an ancient historical 
view of analysis, this was the analytical

25:47.738 --> 25:55.345
approach. And we became enamored with what? Going 
first into molecules, and then into submolecular

26:01.812 --> 26:13.223
parts, and then into subatomic parts.

26:14.637 --> 26:24.948
It became evident as we got into that stage that 
this was beyond life, or so it seemed. And thus,

26:25.870 --> 26:30.795
there was the synthesis that seemed to be 
necessary. Now, the same thing was true of

26:30.875 --> 26:44.290
evolutionary concepts, sort of pulling things 
apart and examining pieces, or as there came out

26:30.875 --> 26:44.290
books in the late 40s in particular that began to 
talk about, well, one was titled Evolution, the

26:44.658 --> 26:59.338
Modern Synthesis, of pulling facts together into 
a coherent sort of thing. So you've got then to say,

26:59.618 --> 27:10.733
yes, analysis is still an important part, 
analytical approach, sure.

27:12.788 --> 27:20.884
The thing that we keep stressing, in fact, 
everything we write around here, for example, we

27:12.788 --> 27:20.884
look at factor trains and systems analysis and 
this sort of stuff. But what we're coming back to is

27:21.004 --> 27:30.443
putting it together to make it a coherent 
intellectual thought.
