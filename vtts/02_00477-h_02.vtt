WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:07.343
I received far more attention from the press than I 
ever wanted.

00:11.368 --> 00:20.098
I'd say 50% of it was accurate and 50% of it was 
exploitation so I could sell the damn article.

00:20.118 --> 00:20.538
Really? Yeah. You thought the exploitation was 
that high? I thought the exploitation was

00:23.902 --> 00:32.232
extremely high, particularly with some 
individuals.

00:34.439 --> 00:35.561
Who were the worst ones? I guess the worst one was a 
communist reporter, Nicholas Tomlinson, from

00:37.583 --> 01:03.400
the London Sunday Times,

00:37.583 --> 01:03.400
who was killed in the Israeli conflict in 60-73,

00:37.583 --> 01:03.400
October War 73. He got what he deserved. He,

01:05.641 --> 01:25.481
I guess, was the worst because he got a full page on 
me on the London Sunday Times and every paper here

01:05.641 --> 01:25.481
in the United States and he wrote from fright, 
total fabrication. Yeah, I was looking for a story

01:26.101 --> 01:31.767
that Americans were killing civilians. So he rode 
with me one afternoon in the helicopter and we got

01:33.518 --> 01:40.666
in a few firefights.

01:42.429 --> 01:55.884
Not at my request, but Westmoreland sent him down 
to Depew and Depew bucked him off to me and I had him

01:42.429 --> 01:55.884
in the back end of the helicopter when I was doing my 
duty that day and I'd forgotten that he was there.

01:55.924 --> 01:58.768
Wouldn't have made any difference anyway. I'd go 
ahead and do what I had to do. And he wrote the

02:01.497 --> 02:02.738
article. I mean, a full page on the London Sunday 
Times. Zap, zap, general killing civilians and so

02:06.302 --> 02:08.565
forth.

02:11.688 --> 02:13.710
And the general said he'd rather do it. Wasn't 
anything he'd rather do better than to go kill the

02:15.212 --> 02:25.463
Kong and all that kind of crap, which was all 
fabricated, all lies. He got what he was coming

02:26.455 --> 02:29.619
from, Israelis. He got killed over in the Israeli 
conflict. Did you ever write to the, was it in the

02:33.645 --> 02:38.051
London Times you said? Yeah, it was the London 
Times, but it was on the front page of every

02:38.071 --> 02:48.565
newspaper in Houston and everyone in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles and every damn place all

02:38.071 --> 02:48.565
over the world. Did you overwrite and refute it? 
No, hell no. You don't bother with that crap

02:53.144 --> 02:57.311
because they're not going to print it anyway, you 
see. The

02:57.351 --> 03:10.194
Chief of Staff of the Army said I'd set back the 
Army's public relations by three years or

02:57.351 --> 03:10.194
something going forth. And my answer to that was, 
well, General, must not been a very doing a very

03:13.081 --> 03:23.795
good job if you're gonna let a communist-inspired 
bastard lie like hell and I'd say the Army's in

03:13.081 --> 03:23.795
pretty bad shape. What'd he say? He didn't say 
anything. I never heard from him. Did you did the

03:28.682 --> 03:30.744
Chief, did you write the Chief of Staff? No, I 
didn't write anybody. I just didn't pay any damn

03:32.286 --> 03:34.129
attention. I didn't know about it for maybe a month 
later. Oh really? Oh yeah. And then the Air Force

03:42.157 --> 03:55.575
agents picked up an article by a Navy, a Soviet Navy 
lieutenant wrote a book, children's book for the

03:42.157 --> 03:55.575
Soviet children, elementary school. Wrote a nice 
little thin book about a lesson that had

03:56.857 --> 04:03.626
three-eighths of an inch thick. Had pictures of 
ducks and little girls picking flowers on the

04:05.669 --> 04:11.337
front of the book and the inside of the book The 
Story of the Number One Cannibal in the Vietnamese

04:12.599 --> 04:19.169
War. And it was from this Tomlinson's article that 
the Navy lieutenant had wrote this book for the

04:21.393 --> 04:31.989
children of the Soviet Union.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.755
OSS got a copy of it. You know, they got copies, I got 
a copy of it, the Air Force sent me a copy, the

04:36.308 --> 04:43.035
Special Agents of the Air Force. I sent it to my 
mother, and I guess she didn't know what it was, and

04:43.856 --> 04:50.783
threw it away, and I've never been able to get a 
handle on another copy of that. Miss

04:50.883 --> 05:01.354
Hollingsworth searched children's libraries in 
the Soviet Union to try to find it, but it just so

04:50.883 --> 05:01.354
happened that that had been removed everywhere 
she went.

05:06.110 --> 05:08.072
I had a bad taste in my mouth about that. Tell me 
about some of the other press people that you dealt

05:08.512 --> 05:11.255
with. Marty Safer. He

05:13.617 --> 05:19.603
was all right. Hart from, I believe he was CBS. I 
think he was NBC. NBC. Yeah, he was NBC. God, I can't

05:29.433 --> 05:31.795
remember any more of them. They were all right. 
They didn't hurt me. Did they try to do an accurate

05:36.181 --> 05:37.683
job? Did the American press in general try to do an 
accurate job? I thought the American press did a

05:40.566 --> 05:44.250
fair job. I thought they did a fair job.

05:52.340 --> 06:04.034
The best guys were guys with real common sense and 
sound judgment and already had made enough money

05:52.340 --> 06:04.034
that they could eat, you know. And that makes a 
difference. Such as? Joe Alsop, he was the best.

06:09.718 --> 06:20.890
Walter Cronkite, old Walter would get bad 
information and fed to him and he just read off

06:09.718 --> 06:20.890
every evening what somebody else had fed him to 
say. And sometimes he'd say good things,

06:20.930 --> 06:26.216
sometimes he'd say bad things. But did you meet 
him? I knew Walter, I guess I met him. Did he come

06:30.740 --> 06:33.323
over to Vietnam when you were there? I don't know 
whether I met him at a press club in Washington or

06:33.522 --> 06:38.668
whether it was over there. I can't remember now. 
He's an awful good man.

06:48.480 --> 06:54.788
I was trying to think of some of the guys from Wall 
Street, but I can't think of their names now.

07:02.902 --> 07:05.045
BBC was never very helpful.

07:08.489 --> 07:11.794
British Broadcasting Company. I think we got 
pretty bad press from all of the Europeans.

07:19.404 --> 07:26.833
Well, I'll tell you, you asked a question I haven't 
answered yet, and that is, should they be over

07:19.404 --> 07:26.833
there? And the answer is absolutely not. Who 
should give the news to the American people? Let

07:33.496 --> 07:50.033
it come from an ambassador from the area who's 
doing the operating, the civilian side of it. In

07:50.053 --> 07:53.637
other words, it should have been handled more like 
this recent Falkland crisis. One hundred

07:53.997 --> 07:56.480
percent. Now there, it was a group of 
professionals down there allowed to run the war.

08:03.007 --> 08:03.267
You see? And what's the end result? You win. Get her 
over with. You know, every time that happens or the

08:12.010 --> 08:19.304
Israelis do something like that, it just makes us 
look like a bunch of damn fools over here. I'm

08:21.067 --> 08:26.858
talking about our bureaucratic, 
administrative, governmental, uh, everybody in

08:27.682 --> 08:35.989
the damned act, uh, when he's, uh, everybody's 
sticking his finger in the damn pie.

08:39.352 --> 08:52.903
And we somehow or another, we gotta get a hold of 
ourselves and quit looking like fools to the rest

08:39.352 --> 08:52.903
of the world and quit trying to go buy, uh, 
friendship. We don't want any friends. We want

08:55.645 --> 08:57.587
people to respect us. that's what we want. And we 
don't want to go buy it either with money or try to do

09:03.359 --> 09:10.150
it because we should have learned a lesson by now, 
don't you think? After multi, multi,

09:10.310 --> 09:25.195
multi-billion dollars worth of taxpayers' money 
trying to buy friendship when what we really ought

09:10.310 --> 09:25.195
to have was demanding that people do things right 
and them respecting us for it.

09:29.832 --> 09:57.443
that's what it's all about respect now

09:29.832 --> 09:57.443
in the world today and I still travel throughout 
the world really and truly no one respects the

09:29.832 --> 09:57.443
United States isn't that a terrible thing I

09:29.832 --> 09:57.443
want to ask you A couple last questions about 
Vietnam, then we're going to move on. A lot of

10:03.032 --> 10:07.258
people blame a lot of people for losing that war. 
Why do you think that we lost, obviously, because

10:08.961 --> 10:14.969
the military wasn't allowed to fight the war? Who 
do you blame? Congress of the United States of

10:16.952 --> 10:20.777
America, who represents all the people.

10:24.662 --> 10:26.485
Congress of the United States. who represents all 
the people. And I've talked to many of them and they

10:31.780 --> 10:35.505
agree with me that that's what it's all about. I've 
had the most sincere of them and the older ones tell

10:35.545 --> 10:42.776
me, General, we'll never do it again.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.042
Well, I'm not so sure. Hell, they'll all be gone in 
another 20 years, so what the hell are you up

10:47.082 --> 10:51.888
against the next time? And what the hell do the 
Congress of the United States or the Army or

10:58.223 --> 11:04.850
administration of the American people ever 
remember from one conflict to the other. Nothing.

11:07.212 --> 11:09.435
That brings me to the last question I want to ask. 
What did we learn from Vietnam? What did the Army

11:11.297 --> 11:14.220
learn from Vietnam? We relearned what we knew from 
Korea, and in Korea we relearned what we knew from

11:14.680 --> 11:23.269
World War II. and I guess that the next conflict 
we'll get in we'll probably relearn what we forgot

11:23.975 --> 11:32.070
in Vietnam.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.324
And what's that? And that is that discipline and 
training and availability of weapons and

11:48.038 --> 11:58.555
ammunition and high standards of performance 
during peacetime and wartime bring success.

12:03.843 --> 12:14.400
And that people are important and don't push them 
beyond their capabilities and the leadership has

12:03.843 --> 12:14.400
to thoroughly and clearly be trained in such a 
manner that they can understand the capabilities

12:15.072 --> 12:18.896
of man.

12:31.871 --> 12:32.852
That's the way I see it. When you returned from 
Vietnam, President Nixon gave you your third

12:33.914 --> 12:42.964
star. Is that right?

12:46.848 --> 12:53.378
My third star came in July of 73, and I can't 
remember who was president then. I don't know. He

12:54.019 --> 12:54.480
was. I think he still was.

12:59.408 --> 13:04.095
He did exactly what he told General Haig to pass on 
to me that he was going to do.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.346
How did you feel about that? You mean about the 
president? About the third star. Well, I felt,

13:16.649 --> 13:32.072
just as I'd said to General Abrams, I've got only 
one eye left and I don't know whether I can see well

13:16.649 --> 13:32.072
enough to do what needs to be done to command 
250,000 men or not.

13:36.579 --> 13:39.544
But my eye got a little better after a little rest. I 
got it pretty well patched back together.

13:48.003 --> 13:50.486
He sent me down to Fort Sam Houston. I had a deputy 
commander down there until I could give me a chance

13:52.588 --> 13:59.976
to, I had to rest up.

14:02.939 --> 14:04.200
And then you went off to Korea. Yeah, I went to 
Korea. Korea was your last major assignment from

14:05.201 --> 14:10.567
July of 73 to February of 76. That was the last 
command assignment. I had another assignment

14:14.391 --> 14:16.153
after that. Yeah, but that was your last major 
assignment. Yeah, major assignment.

14:22.632 --> 14:26.796
What did you see as the problems there when you 
arrived? What was your mission? Bad strategy, bad

14:29.378 --> 14:38.947
defense concept, bad policies by the United 
States for 23 years since 1953. Poor support for

14:41.449 --> 14:46.393
the American Union, poor support for the Koreans I 
walked into the United States Army Ammunition

14:47.318 --> 15:04.540
Depot and I found some, in this one area, some 3,000 
8-inch artillery rounds and only 100 fuses.

15:07.884 --> 15:16.836
When I got through looking at the whole ammunition 
in support of that front, I short 156,000 fuses for

15:07.884 --> 15:16.836
155. millimeter

15:18.014 --> 15:24.846
artillery and eight-inch artillery.

15:29.074 --> 15:29.635
What'd you do? I tore the damn place apart.

15:37.830 --> 15:42.418
And I found Honest John Rockets with corroded 
fins. I found the Honest John Rocket Battalion

15:44.390 --> 15:55.384
with 20 rounds of rockets that everybody said was 
ready to go and the corrosion had eaten up the fins.

15:58.788 --> 16:02.253
And they were totally unserviceable. But that was 
no different. That was bad, but that wasn't the

16:03.815 --> 16:08.801
worst thing. The worst thing was a mission for the— 
American Eighth Army of

16:14.444 --> 16:44.282
and the Koreans and the assistance of the Koreans 
of defending the Republic of Korea and the capital

16:14.444 --> 16:44.282
city of Seoul which consists of eight million 
Koreans located 25 miles from the DMZ and their

16:14.444 --> 16:44.282
policy And their concept for descending the 
capital city of Seoul in the Republic of Korea was

16:45.258 --> 16:55.813
to fall back on successive lines.

17:01.882 --> 17:14.961
And the last line was buttressed up against the 
capital city of Seoul, and I merely asked the

17:01.882 --> 17:14.961
question, how do you defend the capital city of 
Seoul if your last offensive position is on the

17:15.329 --> 17:24.002
northern outskirts of it.

17:24.022 --> 17:29.771
I said, have you gentlemen here ever heard of 
attacks by fire? Have you ever heard the communist

17:32.075 --> 17:40.628
theory that if you can physically defend the 
capital city of Seoul from us, We'll disallow it to

17:42.548 --> 17:46.634
you because we'll destroy it by fire.

17:54.005 --> 18:09.568
So, with the great support of President Park 
Chung-hee, not so much U.S.,

17:54.005 --> 18:09.568
I bulldozed through which approved by the 
Secretary of Defense and the DMZ up there, I

18:11.202 --> 18:30.820
bulldozed through a new offensive training 
program, a new offensive concept

18:11.202 --> 18:30.820
for the defense of the Republic of Korea and 37 
million people. Be damned the American policy,

18:32.201 --> 18:39.167
the ambassador, and even General Stilwell, my 
commander, has helpful as he wanted to be, he also

18:39.822 --> 18:45.530
had to look at the State Department political side 
of things. But before I left there, for the first

18:46.632 --> 19:01.133
time since MacArthur went to Yellow, there was a 
plan that had been exercised in the field

18:46.632 --> 19:01.133
attacking to the north.

19:03.837 --> 19:04.598
And I did that. I guess a lot of people take credit 
for it now, but I tell you what, I fought day and

19:06.603 --> 19:16.638
night to get that done single-handedly against 
the United States. Why was the United States

19:17.739 --> 19:20.283
against this? They had a policy of falling back 
because they were afraid the Koreans might attack

19:20.744 --> 19:27.894
the North Communists.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.943
So their policy was, don't give them anything. 
disallow them, they actually disallowed them

19:34.615 --> 19:54.475
over the years prior to my presence there, 
disallowed them the facts of life on the real

19:34.615 --> 19:54.475
capabilities of the Communist North.

19:54.495 --> 20:02.263
So they were afraid the South Koreans would get an 
offensive plan and attack the North and get the

19:54.495 --> 20:02.263
United States in a war. That's State Department 
crap. And you cannot lie to a sovereign

20:06.998 --> 20:12.843
government. I don't care who they are.

20:17.147 --> 20:24.833
And I would not put up with that at all. I told the 
Koreans the truth. I broke the green door down from

20:27.876 --> 20:36.583
a standpoint of them having information that they 
ought to know.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.816
about the strength of the North.

20:45.742 --> 20:53.934
You see, our policy was don't tell them anything 
and they won't ask us for any more arms. We would

20:55.537 --> 20:57.039
say, oh, you've got enough. You don't need no more. 
The enemy's only got this amount. You don't need no

21:01.786 --> 21:02.728
more. In their fear, if you give them too much, 
they'll go attack the North. Well, what did Henry

21:09.284 --> 21:13.090
Kissinger, the Secretary of State, have to say 
about your policy?

21:16.475 --> 21:36.945
When the May collapse came in 73,

21:16.475 --> 21:36.945
no, I guess it was a little later on, was it 74, when 
the Vietnamese took Saigon, I mean the Communists

21:16.475 --> 21:36.945
took Saigon, Must have been May of 74, yeah. May of 
74. No, it was early in 75. Or was it 75? Yeah, 75. It

21:49.791 --> 21:51.073
was May of 75. May of 75, okay. Yeah, let's see. 72 is 
when we fought. Yeah, it took them three years to

21:56.261 --> 22:01.510
get their goddamn offensive capability back 
together. That's That's how badly we beat hell out

22:02.255 --> 22:05.259
of them in 72. Their offensive capability we 
destroyed. It took them three years to put it back

22:07.962 --> 22:10.545
together. That's right. That's right. May of

22:12.248 --> 22:15.972
75. President of Korea

22:18.756 --> 22:31.772
said,

22:18.756 --> 22:31.772
Are you going to let down... South Korea as you did 
Vietnam. That's what he asked you? Yep. He asked

22:38.728 --> 22:41.792
our government this. He asked our authorities 
this. He asked ambassadors this. He asked me

22:49.003 --> 22:50.364
personally this. I had a personal relationship 
with him, which the United States didn't like

22:53.108 --> 22:59.117
worth a damn. Why not?

23:05.030 --> 23:14.505
He was the president, and I was the only field army 
commander, and they had an ambassador there, and

23:05.030 --> 23:14.505
they had a four-star general there, and you know 
how it goes. But they had nothing they could do

23:16.287 --> 23:17.609
about it. Nothing anybody could do about it. But he 
said, what are you going to do? Are you going to let

23:24.740 --> 23:26.483
us down, same thing? So we had— What did you 
respond? I said, no. I said, no. I said, we had no

23:32.648 --> 23:37.796
mutual security pact validated by the Congress 
with the Vietnamese.

23:40.180 --> 23:50.176
He said, but your Congress,

23:40.180 --> 23:50.176
your president has, you're going to treat us like 
you did Taiwan. You had a mutual security pact with

23:51.558 --> 23:53.862
Taiwan. That's a good point. I said, Mr. 
President, I came over here and I said, I'd fight

23:59.502 --> 24:04.969
and die with your units out here to defend this 
country. And that's what I intend to do. And I said,

24:08.874 --> 24:15.382
I worked to change the strategy in which you 
supported me. And I said, by God, we've got

24:17.805 --> 24:23.932
ammunition in here. We've got the air power so we 
know we can get it in here. And I said, I just want you

24:30.907 --> 24:42.243
to know that I am totally convinced that we will 
live up to our treaty in the case of Korea.

24:45.668 --> 24:59.547
Well, of course, this word went back to Washington 
by our ambassadors on the 4th, so what we really

24:45.668 --> 24:59.547
created was an assurance program to reassure 
Korea that we would do it. Ford got in the act and

25:00.657 --> 25:07.204
said, by God, we'll bomb the hell out of the 
bastards. Kissinger said, we'll bomb the hell out

25:07.224 --> 25:09.647
of the bastards. Schlesinger, in defense, said, 
we'll bomb the hell out of the bastards that come

25:10.508 --> 25:14.372
down there. And, of course, my whole strategy, in 
which everybody was against, which is now in

25:16.054 --> 25:29.989
being, fell right into the hands of saying, God 
damn it, We're not giving up anything. I said, Mr.

25:34.181 --> 25:38.207
President, we're not going to give up one inch of 
your precious land. He picked up on that and

25:39.909 --> 25:43.054
started telling the Korean people.

25:47.781 --> 25:55.512
And every governor of every province I visited, I 
made speeches to them. In every province, I

25:55.532 --> 25:59.858
visited industry. I was known by all of them.

26:07.709 --> 26:25.693
The new strategy of taking the offensive should 
the enemy attempt to cross the DMZ and killing them

26:07.709 --> 26:25.693
with firepower,

26:07.709 --> 26:25.693
the introduction of B-52s, Introduction of 
F-111s over there bombing on the ground so

26:27.091 --> 26:31.377
everybody could see them. The introduction of 
fighter-bomber demonstrations right near the

26:32.058 --> 26:38.347
DMZ. The coordination, teach them how to 
consolidate artillery fire and time on target. I

26:45.117 --> 26:49.343
fired 33 battalions over there one time to show 
them. And the little Korean soldiers got up out of

26:49.964 --> 26:55.832
their holes and clapped and sang because they knew 
For the first time, by God, we're not going to be run

26:56.150 --> 27:00.655
out of these positions. Somebody said, why didn't 
you fire 33 battalions? I said, well, I had to do one

27:05.461 --> 27:14.612
better than I did in World War II some 25 years ago 
when I laid 32 battalions on 22 Tiger Royals. And I

27:16.474 --> 27:18.136
said, that's exactly the reason. And of course, 
nobody in the American Army has ever seen anything

27:19.217 --> 27:24.503
like that before. unheard of but i did it in korea 
you lined them all up and just let it go no you move

27:25.613 --> 27:46.795
them in you don't line them up you move them in 
they're sitting everywhere but they're sitting

27:25.613 --> 27:46.795
many four and five miles apart in depth and all back 
over 33 battalions and you just blow the whistle

27:25.613 --> 27:46.795
tot time on target

27:49.627 --> 27:58.259
You hear guns way back to the rear, boom, boom, 
boom, boom, boom, boom, and then ones up front

27:49.627 --> 27:58.259
finally shooting and every round hitting at the 
same time. It's the most awesome sight that you can

27:59.681 --> 28:03.687
see. It's equivalent to about a 10 KT warhead in 
conventional firepower. And this is a

28:12.560 --> 28:21.089
demonstration to the South Korean people and to 
their military what I'm talking about about

28:12.560 --> 28:21.089
winning. They left no doubts in their mind.

28:27.034 --> 28:37.085
So that brought on in 12 months time forward 
defense which has been accepted. Everybody talks

28:37.145 --> 28:39.967
about forward defense. Forward defense is 
Destroying the offensive capability as quick as,

28:42.682 --> 28:48.390
or the enemy's capability as quickly as possible. 
Destroying his attack as quickly as possible and

28:48.410 --> 28:51.814
then attacking yourself. Again, with

28:53.416 --> 28:59.124
a high volume of fire. Don't go bring over ten 
American divisions. You don't need any damn

29:02.348 --> 29:03.970
American divisions. You got more, all the 
American divisions you need over an hour at one.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.220
And that's for present purposes. that you're 
there and that you're going to stay and you're

29:12.179 --> 29:19.908
going to fight and die with them.

29:19.928 --> 29:25.535
What you do bring over is firepower delivery 
stuff, air power, B-52, F-111. Now, right after

29:26.015 --> 29:32.083
you left and— That's where I won the money, Mr. 
Quintus. As a result of that, in 12 months' time,

29:32.103 --> 29:39.992
all the thousands and thousands of acres of fallow 
land behind the DMZ was opened up and the president

29:40.698 --> 29:55.954
believed so much in what I was doing that he put the 
Department of Agriculture, Korean Department of

29:40.698 --> 29:55.954
Agriculture and irrigation people up there and 
started irrigating all this land in 12 months.

29:57.976 --> 30:05.103
They had received, for the first time in 4,000 
years, it had become self-sufficient in rice

29:57.976 --> 30:05.103
grain. In addition to that, We started a 
reforestation program. They burned all the trees

30:12.658 --> 30:20.628
to stay warm because they had no clothing during 
the war, and the enemy did likewise. And so it's

30:21.969 --> 30:30.820
time now to reforest, get forests growing like 
they used to be with pine going forth in the

30:21.969 --> 30:30.820
mountains and all over the place. And each of my 
three Lieutenant General Corps commanders took

30:31.728 --> 30:41.782
on a responsibility of pulling necessary 
soldiers out in his Corps area of responsibility.

30:41.802 --> 30:57.583
And over the course of the last two years of the era, 
they planted 15 or 20 million pine seedlings, of

30:41.802 --> 30:57.583
which They got from 80 to 90% growth

30:59.335 --> 31:08.284
rate in each of the different core areas. 
Fantastic. The president built new roads for me.

31:16.212 --> 31:24.280
The governor came to me and he said, sir, I want to 
honor you with this gift here, he said, governor of

31:16.212 --> 31:24.280
the province. He said, the president down 
yesterday, I've been trying for five years to get a

31:25.205 --> 31:39.541
new road up to Tan Du Shan, from Wu John Bu to Tan Du 
Shan for the second infantry division, U.S.

31:25.205 --> 31:39.541
infantry division. And said, the president came 
down yesterday and made a speech about you and said

31:39.561 --> 31:47.951
that I had asked for a road and that he was going to 
get it. And they built it. Dedicated it. Then he

31:52.596 --> 31:54.098
turned to me and he said, any other roads you want, 
go on into it. And I said, yes sir, one out here

31:57.451 --> 32:03.119
connecting my first corps and my fifth corps. And 
he turned to the minister of construction and that

32:05.322 --> 32:15.435
was built in my honor and finished a few months 
after I left. No kidding. Yeah.

32:20.682 --> 32:21.283
And uh,

32:24.622 --> 32:42.899
It was a very heartwarming thing for me to fight my 
own country and the interests of my own country and

32:24.622 --> 32:42.899
the interests of those 37 million people over 
there and get something done that was right and

32:24.622 --> 32:42.899
proper. At first, the State Department, you said, 
was against your policy, but then after 1970— My

32:42.919 --> 32:53.228
concept was strategy. and after 1975 and the fall 
of Saigon, then they turned around and they

32:53.647 --> 33:04.605
accepted your policy and it fit right in. Is that 
correct? Yes, exactly right. And then they got off

33:08.251 --> 33:09.513
your backs. They got off my back then, yes. It was 
kind of anxious for me to leave because they

33:11.677 --> 33:19.570
weren't so damn sure that I wouldn't I think they 
felt that I might entice the Koreans into

33:19.718 --> 33:24.686
attacking to the north. Really? Oh, yeah. I mean, 
you can't imagine what goes through the minds of

33:26.609 --> 33:33.820
some of the cheap people we got in this country in 
high places. Honest to God. For example— You mean

33:36.724 --> 33:41.151
you got the word back from the State Department? 
No, I did not get that back from the State

33:41.171 --> 33:43.755
Department. I got that from members of the— of the 
American staff in Korea.

33:54.495 --> 34:09.261
I got word also that one of my corps commanders and 
I, the first tunnel we found over there, that

33:54.495 --> 34:09.261
there's some question about whether or not that 
had been dug at my insistence.

34:12.066 --> 34:12.928
Tunnel for what? tunnel from the north at the 
communist north that dug under the DMZ so they

34:13.330 --> 34:37.988
could get slip into South Korea we found this 
tunnel and then we found another much larger one

34:13.330 --> 34:37.988
and some of the midget staff people of both the 
state and the army were mouthing around that

34:39.217 --> 34:48.187
General Hollingsworth and the Corps commander 
had instigated the tunnel on their own.

34:51.491 --> 34:57.077
Oh, you can't imagine what you have to go through as 
a public servant. Did you formally have to

34:57.357 --> 34:58.999
respond? Hell, no. I tell them to go to hell. I said, 
well, you ignorant bastards. I mean, someone

35:05.997 --> 35:08.359
called and asked you? Oh, no, what they do, they 
pass it to your staff. They don't bother you.

35:13.544 --> 35:15.646
They're afraid to talk to you, you see. They're 
afraid to talk to me. But they staff the staff and

35:18.068 --> 35:33.722
say, well, there's been discuss down here as to 
whether or not this is a fake thing and that your

35:18.068 --> 35:33.722
boss and the corps commander didn't dig this 
tunnel on their own. Jeez. You've got some cheap

35:36.406 --> 35:41.111
people in this country. You've got some ruthless 
people. Who do you think originated this? Oh,

35:48.678 --> 35:52.622
somebody that didn't want this tunnel to happen.

35:55.385 --> 35:56.946
Who do you think came up with this rumor? Oh, hell. 
Who's responsible? I don't know. I tell you what,

35:59.769 --> 36:03.713
you never pay any attention to this sort of thing. 
Then they didn't want anybody to come up and see it.

36:07.788 --> 36:08.548
The U.S. didn't.

36:12.693 --> 36:14.555
Because they still didn't want to believe it.

36:19.379 --> 36:24.384
But the Koreans sent people up there to see them 
anyway. So after the U.S. looked like a bunch of

36:24.404 --> 36:34.054
goddamn fools for a while, well, then they say, all 
right, I guess we can let a few people go up see it.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.788
Who's they? The ambassador? State department 
officials and high military officials in Korea.

36:46.423 --> 36:49.087
Who was the senior military officer in Korea? 
Let's see, I think General Stilwell was at the

36:50.589 --> 36:58.622
time, but that doesn't necessarily say General 
Stilwell did it. Maybe he had some major general

37:00.798 --> 37:02.821
staff down there. You never did know whether 
Stilwell really meant that or some underling did

37:02.861 --> 37:07.747
that, you see.

37:11.232 --> 37:17.299
Because Stilwell was a damn sharp, common sense 
sort of fella.

37:20.203 --> 37:23.848
But he also got some pressures from the 
ambassador. The ambassador's the number one guy

37:23.868 --> 37:27.092
over there, you know. and so you never know what 
kind of pressures he gets from the ambassador.

37:39.838 --> 37:41.440
He has to respond to him. Let's talk a little bit 
about, we've already talked about how you got

37:42.281 --> 37:47.688
along with the president of Korea. Tell me about 
the relations that you had with the people of

37:48.028 --> 37:52.314
Korea. You said you visited factories. Did you go 
out and sort of campaign for your strategy, or

37:56.553 --> 38:00.500
what? No, they invited me. You see, my 
headquarters was 80%, I believe, 60%, can't

38:05.127 --> 38:18.410
remember the percentage now, somewhere between 
60% and 80% Korean. My deputy was a major general,

38:20.413 --> 38:22.797
Korean. My chief of operations was a brigadier 
general, Korean. My chief of intelligence was an

38:28.782 --> 38:31.486
American colonel. My chief of staff was an 
American brigadier general. The deputy chief of

38:37.396 --> 38:40.361
staff was a Korean colonel. So, on a key position, 
my chief of supply and logistics was American with

38:41.242 --> 38:50.978
a Korean deputy. Korean in a key slot, the deputy 
was American. Wherever the American was a key

38:55.014 --> 39:00.441
slot, the deputy was a Korean. So, I was the 
commander of the field army, and the deputy was a

39:00.461 --> 39:06.608
major general Korean. So, they know what the hell 
is going on, and they keep all the Koreans advised,

39:07.469 --> 39:12.456
you see. And so, most all this business of my 
visiting amongst the people and going forth was my

39:18.616 --> 39:41.471
interest in the people and their industry, which 
had to participate in supporting what I needed

39:18.616 --> 39:41.471
from the standpoint of

39:18.616 --> 39:41.471
logistics support and supply and material for the 
twelve Korean divisions that I commanded. I only

39:41.491 --> 39:45.096
had one American division, but the other twelve 
were were Korean, so it was all Korean. And the 2nd

39:49.264 --> 39:55.651
Infantry Division, my American division, wasn't 
going to fight anyway until I started attacking to

39:49.264 --> 39:55.651
the north. Now I was going to let them, I had a plan to 
let them attack to the north as a matter of honor for

39:56.432 --> 40:02.779
the United States. You know, you can't have the 
United States Army over there fighting a war and

40:02.899 --> 40:09.826
them just sitting on their ass. What did you think 
of the capability of the Korean forces?

40:18.202 --> 40:29.392
One Korean division properly equipped can stand 
off three Soviet divisions and two American

40:18.202 --> 40:29.392
divisions. They're

40:29.432 --> 40:35.818
the toughest little guys that you've ever seen in 
your life.

40:40.522 --> 40:46.487
We used 4,000 rounds of artillery in training each 
year for our artillery battalion. They'd been

40:47.497 --> 40:57.993
forced to by necessity and to conserve ammunition 
because they never knew whether the United States

40:47.497 --> 40:57.993
was gonna, until I was there, until the United 
States was gonna run out on them or not. So they were

40:58.835 --> 41:01.399
very conservative about their ammunition. But 
they trained so well and would fire 300 to 600

41:02.260 --> 41:13.217
rounds of artillery per battalion of 18 pieces and 
they'd out-shoot the U.S. In the U.S., it would

41:13.822 --> 41:19.629
shoot 4,000 rounds a year or more of training. 
That's how good they are. They've got some, and I

41:23.774 --> 41:31.163
prefaced my remarks earlier by having them 
properly equipped. They need more secure voice

41:32.785 --> 41:38.032
communications. They don't have that. They need 
some air defense weapons. for their divisions.

41:44.487 --> 41:48.072
They need new and better artillery ammunition. 
They need better tank ammunition.

41:56.204 --> 42:05.658
But as far as physical fitness, alertness, 
readiness, leadership amongst themselves,

41:56.204 --> 42:05.658
they're tops. After your return in 1977, 
President Carter was thinking about bringing

42:12.023 --> 42:17.069
some American troops home from Korea. What was 
your—he didn't do it—what was your opinion? There

42:21.615 --> 42:26.781
was a lot of resistance

42:21.615 --> 42:26.781
from the military. What was your opinion? My 
opinion was that the United States had announced

42:28.803 --> 42:35.972
that They have a national interest in the Western 
Pacific, Japan, Australia, the Malacca Straits,

42:37.218 --> 42:59.283
for trade and for friendship and for many other 
reasons we have national interest in the Western

42:37.218 --> 42:59.283
Pacific. And they always come back and say in key 
places, Japan. The defense of the Republic of

43:05.635 --> 43:18.590
Korea is vital to the defense of Japan, absolutely 
vital to the defense of Japan. Korea and the

43:18.710 --> 43:21.773
peninsula is a very dangerous land. Surrounded by 
communist Chinese,

43:23.295 --> 43:34.528
Soviet communists, and a totalitarian communist 
state of North Korea supported by China and the

43:35.757 --> 43:39.741
Soviet Union. So it's a very dangerous peninsula. 
And our presence there plays a major role in

43:45.866 --> 43:52.272
maintaining stability in Northeast Asia. And why 
play in the hands of the Communists by pulling

43:53.513 --> 44:05.123
Americans out of there and then taking a chance on 
the Chinese communists, South Korean communists

44:05.457 --> 44:22.859
overwhelming the South Korean government and 
then becoming a major threat to Japan and

44:05.457 --> 44:22.859
Australia and the Malarca Straits along with the 
Soviet fleet. Does that make any goddamn sense to

44:24.220 --> 44:26.844
anybody? Only to a guy named Abramowitz who was 
ambassador to Thailand who was the instigator of

44:35.680 --> 44:41.308
trying to withdraw my headquarters and the 
Americans for a long, long time. He sat over in the

44:41.388 --> 44:52.003
Defense Department and he played footsie with 
those coming in in the Carter administration and

44:41.388 --> 44:52.003
this is one of the things that he perpetuated. He 
got himself an ambassadorship out of it. I

44:57.030 --> 45:04.641
testified along with him and General Vesey in the 
Senate Armed Services against the withdrawal.

45:05.498 --> 45:19.734
That gentleman right there, Senator Sam Nunn, and 
his knowledge of what's needed to be done over

45:05.498 --> 45:19.734
there, was a key instrumental guy in defeating the 
whole damn thing and keeping them over there. And

45:22.457 --> 45:24.339
there isn't any questions about that.

45:28.964 --> 45:34.290
This Bromowitz went on to be the ambassador.
