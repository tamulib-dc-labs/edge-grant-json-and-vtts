00:03.237 --> 00:15.088
When you come back as a member of the leadership group, you worked for Sears and remained in the Air Force Reserve.

00:15.528 --> 00:28.980
When my orders for the Korean conflict were canceled, then I had an obligation to serve in the Reserve and also to serve two years active duty.

00:29.481 --> 00:30.882
So I went to work for Sears.

00:31.368 --> 00:40.877
in the summer of 53, worked through Christmas, and then I was called active duty in March of 54.

00:41.978 --> 00:48.165
And so I went on a military leave of absence from Sears so that my time with Sears kept ticking while I was gone.

00:48.405 --> 00:52.569
So that built up some seniority for me while I was actually away on active duty.

00:52.589 --> 00:54.271
I was only on active duty for two years.

00:55.572 --> 00:57.814
And then when I came back to Sears,

00:59.178 --> 01:07.851
I worked there several years and then came to Bryan when this store was fairly new at Townshire as what we call an area manager.

01:07.892 --> 01:12.238
I had several departments under my jurisdiction at that time, what we call hard lines departments.

01:13.360 --> 01:24.898
And then I left Sears to go into business for myself with a Whites Auto store in Caldwell, Texas.

01:25.604 --> 01:26.645
which was a mistake.

01:27.847 --> 01:40.283
But in retrospect, it may not have been because had I not left Sears to go to put in my own business, I probably would have stayed with Sears, which may or may not have been a good move.

01:40.304 --> 01:41.105
You know, we'll never know.

01:42.086 --> 01:48.174
But the business in Caldwell was not successful, so I had to get a job somewhere.

01:48.494 --> 01:55.003
Well, I was in a reserve unit in College Station out at Easterwood Airport, and a friend of mine, Calvin Reese, was a tactical officer

01:55.473 --> 01:58.756
in a cadet corps working for Colonel Joe Davis, the commandant at the time.

01:59.917 --> 02:05.443
And he said, you know, I heard Colonel Davis said that he's going to need to hire a tactical officer.

02:06.344 --> 02:07.525
And he said, would you be interested?

02:07.805 --> 02:11.990
Well, at that time, we were selling Coke bottles, empty bottles to buy groceries just about.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.912
I said, would I, boy, you know.

02:14.572 --> 02:18.176
So I went in and interviewed, got the job, and started to work.

02:18.196 --> 02:18.917
And that's when?

02:19.097 --> 02:21.619
I started to work in January of 61 at A&M.

02:22.460 --> 02:24.282
Do you remember that time?

02:26.287 --> 02:28.469
I don't remember that thing.

02:28.489 --> 02:32.293
As it worked out, that was a nine-month job as a tactical officer.

02:32.854 --> 02:41.283
And that's when the summer between my, I had some time off between the time school ended and started, but summer school was in progress.

02:41.924 --> 02:44.967
So I started to work on my master's degree during the summer months.

02:45.828 --> 02:55.618
And at that time, we were allowed, as long as it didn't interfere with our work, we were allowed to take one course a day, one course a semester while we were fully employed.

02:56.273 --> 03:08.634
So through that program and I went two summers, I was a tactical officer for two years, two summers, and then I finished my master's degree in organization and management at that time.

03:11.058 --> 03:21.977
And then after that two years, there was an organization on the campus headed up by Jim Bradley,

03:22.396 --> 03:26.842
called Industrial Economics Research Division, which was a part of TEAS at that time.

03:27.763 --> 03:36.795
So I went to work for Jim doing market research work for two years, and we had a personnel director named Clark Monroe.

03:36.815 --> 03:40.200
And I call you Clark about half the time, and I call him Haskell when I see him.

03:40.681 --> 03:43.084
But anyway, I don't know how he spells his last name.

03:43.144 --> 03:46.028
Maybe not the same as your... Is it a little bit differently there?

03:46.869 --> 03:49.112
But Clark had remembered...

03:50.105 --> 04:00.896
For some reason, when he saw my resume when I was moving from a tactical officer job to industrial economics research, he had remembered that I'd had eight years with Sierra Roebuck.

04:01.957 --> 04:10.086
Well, the manager of the old exchange store, Carl Birdwell, he has a son named Dickie Birdwell that lives here in town now.

04:10.366 --> 04:12.208
He used to be on College Station City Council.

04:13.089 --> 04:16.753
But his father was Doc Birdwell, Carl Birdwell, they called him Doc.

04:17.442 --> 04:21.588
was the manager of the old exchange store, and he was about to retire.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.052
So they were looking for a replacement for Doc.

04:25.553 --> 04:29.018
And Clark had remembered that I had eight years' experience with Sears.

04:29.839 --> 04:32.182
He called me up and asked me if I'd be interested in a job.

04:32.202 --> 04:36.108
Well, it paid more than where I was, so at that point, you bet I was interested.

04:36.128 --> 04:37.469
Well, that's about when?

04:37.489 --> 04:41.455
That was in, let's see, 61, 2, 3, 4, that was in 65.

04:42.757 --> 04:46.622
Went to work in June of 65 as the manager of the exchange store.

04:47.615 --> 04:59.789
And I'll never forget, back in those days, Earl Rudder was personally involved in selection of almost anyone that had any position of any importance whatsoever on the campus.

05:01.231 --> 05:07.638
And so before they made an offer to me, Tom Cherry was the vice president for business affairs at that time.

05:08.399 --> 05:11.783
And he had pretty well made his mind up that I was the one that he wanted.

05:12.151 --> 05:16.467
But he really didn't have the authority to make me the offer until President Rutter had blessed it.

05:17.270 --> 05:21.565
So President Rutter asked me to come to his office.

05:21.585 --> 05:23.713
Well, I went in, of course, halfway scared to death.

05:24.048 --> 05:27.251
He was in the systems building.

05:28.252 --> 05:33.438
And he invited me to sit down.

05:34.599 --> 05:38.262
And he says, Cargill, what makes you think you can run that store?

05:39.203 --> 05:41.446
That was his greeting.

05:42.847 --> 05:45.930
And I expected maybe some small talk.

05:45.950 --> 05:46.591
There was none.

05:47.412 --> 05:49.234
What makes you think you can run that store?

05:49.254 --> 05:50.595
And he just sat there and looked at me.

05:51.335 --> 05:57.551
But I started talking about my degree from A&M and my experience with Sears.

05:58.153 --> 06:00.499
And I happened to mention that I was from Eddie, Texas.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.404
He lit up like a light bulb.

06:03.347 --> 06:06.475
He said, did you ever know a young lady from Eddie named Mary Lee Osborne?

06:07.687 --> 06:08.908
I said, yes, sir, I knew her.

06:08.948 --> 06:10.130
She was my next-door neighbor.

06:10.590 --> 06:15.095
Her father was the leader of our Sunday school department in our church.

06:16.237 --> 06:17.618
Well, he used to date Mary Lee.

06:18.399 --> 06:25.367
And back in the early, well, I'm not sure he dated her, but he knew her well back when he was just a young, young, young man.

06:26.728 --> 06:30.272
And so he kind of warmed up a little bit, and we talked a little bit about my background.

06:30.312 --> 06:33.476
And he said, well, he said, I think you ought to have a chance at that store.

06:33.516 --> 06:34.697
Let's see what you can do with it.

06:35.518 --> 06:37.120
And he hired me that day.

06:37.285 --> 06:46.722
All right, as you recall that conversation, did he ask you any question which in hindsight was inappropriate or a waste of time?

06:49.030 --> 06:58.944
At that time, I was already in the reserves, and I think I'd made first lieutenant at that time, and he was very interested in the fact that I was a commissioned officer.

06:59.325 --> 07:00.607
That was a plus.

07:00.927 --> 07:02.329
That was a plus, definitely.

07:03.751 --> 07:10.200
I'm not sure that would be an inappropriate question nowadays or not, but that's the only thing that I recall that he expressed an interest in.

07:10.761 --> 07:13.425
Was there any humor at all?

07:13.445 --> 07:16.029
Not at that time, no, no.

07:16.550 --> 07:18.132
That was my impression of him, too.

07:18.192 --> 07:18.953
I went there.

07:19.034 --> 07:21.438
In his office, it was business.

07:21.458 --> 07:22.359
It was strictly business.

07:23.962 --> 07:34.979
Some three years later, we had put together some charts showing the growth of the store, the growth of the profits, and what we had done and so forth.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.005
And Howard Vestal was my immediate boss at that time.

07:39.286 --> 07:42.791
He was director of what we later called Director of Business Services.

07:42.871 --> 07:47.218
I think his title was Director of Auxiliary Enterprises, and he reported to Tom Cherry.

07:47.738 --> 07:50.362
And I reported to Howard as the manager of the bookstore.

07:51.003 --> 07:58.455
So Mr. Cherry and Howard invited President Rutter over to take a look at this little briefing we had put together.

07:59.157 --> 08:00.960
And all the arrows pointed up.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.223
We were making money and doing well.

08:03.283 --> 08:09.814
And, of course, our profits at that time, and I think still to some extent, go toward student activities and what have you.

08:10.132 --> 08:12.998
And so we were able to generate a lot of money for student activities.

08:13.719 --> 08:21.556
And he was very complimentary and said, well, he said, I think three years ago when we talked in my office that I made the right choice.

08:21.576 --> 08:30.975
So that was the only semi compliment that never did really have too much personal one on one with one other exception, which was I'll never forget.

08:33.301 --> 08:35.584
You remember the Aggie Joke books when they first came out?

08:36.685 --> 08:37.647
The phone rang one day.

08:37.707 --> 08:42.112
My secretary said, Mr. Cargill, Mr. Cargill said, President Rudder's on the telephone.

08:42.152 --> 08:42.753
I said, sure.

08:42.773 --> 08:43.774
You know, they were always pulling.

08:43.834 --> 08:44.656
I said, sure it is.

08:44.696 --> 08:45.396
I picked up on that.

08:45.416 --> 08:46.057
I said, hello.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.380
You know, he said, this is Earl Rudder.

08:48.601 --> 08:50.383
I knew right then that it was Earl Rudder.

08:51.484 --> 08:54.148
It was not one of my buddies pulling the trick on me.

08:54.188 --> 08:56.811
He said, uh...

08:56.791 --> 09:21.769
i understand y'all got some aggie joke books for sale over there i said yes sir president rudder i said we got a bunch of them and they're selling like hot cakes that was a wrong answer and he let out a few expertise and he says if you don't have those books off of sale before quitting time today i'm gonna fire your ass and he said do i make myself clear and he said if i ever catch another one in there i'm gonna fire you

09:22.373 --> 09:24.055
I said, yes, sir, I understand completely.

09:24.615 --> 09:27.858
And to this day, we've never sold another Aggie joke book.

09:27.918 --> 09:40.209
Did he ever, as far as you're aware, directly to you or to someone, through someone else, give any other directions of what the bookstore ought to sell or not sell?

09:45.414 --> 09:50.058
I can't answer that question completely, but I can tell you what I think.

09:50.438 --> 09:51.199
For years...

09:51.719 --> 10:00.771
Before I ever got there, the bookstore sold sports clothes, blue jeans, slacks, and we sold sport coats.

10:01.512 --> 10:05.036
Now, the kids never bought sport coats, but the faculty and staff did.

10:05.557 --> 10:10.464
And we never asked for credentials, so I'm sure a lot of the townspeople bought sport coats.

10:11.565 --> 10:14.289
And there were some competitors off campus, A.M.

10:14.309 --> 10:14.689
Waldrop,

10:14.956 --> 10:17.860
up at Northgate, for example, for one, and I don't know who else.

10:18.181 --> 10:21.666
I think he had, of course, a store downtown.

10:21.886 --> 10:23.749
Alistair Waldrop had a store downtown, too.

10:24.911 --> 10:37.109
But I understand that someone complained to Bill Moore when he was senator that we had no business selling sport coats and sportswear that the students didn't wear anyway.

10:40.033 --> 10:44.760
So as a result of that, and whether Bill Moore called

10:45.601 --> 10:52.207
or whether he called Tom Cherry or whether he called Howard Vestal or whether somebody else called him.

10:52.227 --> 10:58.033
But I got instructions down that it probably would be a good idea if we got out of the sport coat business, which we did.

10:59.815 --> 11:03.438
But I don't know if he was ever involved in that or not, but I suspect that he might have been.

11:04.719 --> 11:06.061
All right, go the other way.

11:06.081 --> 11:12.807
Are there any things that you from anywhere were led to believe that the store ought to start selling?

11:15.065 --> 11:20.552
No, no, I don't recall anything because we were, we would carry a lot of things

11:20.887 --> 11:27.775
that were non-profitable because they were convenience items and because we were asked to by various professors on the campus.

11:27.935 --> 11:48.278
Architecture sticks in my mind, for example, they used a lot of weird kinds of graph paper and maybe some particular types of colors of inks and so forth that no one else, none of the off-campus stores would carry because they wouldn't sell one bottle every three or four years, but we carried them because we were asked to.

11:49.135 --> 11:51.261
Pascal, I'm sorry, I've got to go to the restroom again here.

11:53.667 --> 12:04.116
Once I start drinking carbonated drinks, it's... When you took over the bookstore, what was the... In what condition was it?

12:04.237 --> 12:04.798
Was it a...

12:05.352 --> 12:10.497
Was it doing well, or did you have some repair work to do?

12:10.737 --> 12:11.358
Some of each.

12:12.779 --> 12:13.940
It was well run.

12:14.001 --> 12:18.545
Doc Birdwell did a good job, but his resources were very limited.

12:18.565 --> 12:26.413
Auxiliary enterprises are required to make their own way.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.256
We got absolutely no tax money, no subsidies.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.659
In fact, we were expected to generate a profit, not cost money.

12:33.297 --> 12:39.065
As I recall, the volume, the year that I went in was $640,000 for the first year.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.931
They do 10, 12, 15 million a year now.

12:43.952 --> 12:54.748
I'd say when I left some eight years later to take my next promotion, as I recall, we were doing around $2 or $3 million a year at that time.

12:55.032 --> 12:57.596
Of course, a lot of that was caused by the growth of the university.

12:58.236 --> 13:06.248
And so just what portion was caused by good management and what portion was caused by increased enrollment, we'll really never know.

13:07.089 --> 13:11.355
And the primary competitor was, or one of the competitors, Mr. Lupo.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.957
Lupo.

13:13.308 --> 13:15.533
Then later on, John Rainey put in a bookstore.

13:16.094 --> 13:26.796
But at the time I went in, there were really two, Lupo and Herb Shaffer, which now is a university bookstore at the Northgate, owned by Martha Kemp, Martha and Ernie Kemp.

13:28.419 --> 13:30.563
Was Old Army Lou a fair competitor?

13:30.583 --> 13:31.906
He was, and a good friend.

13:32.447 --> 13:34.371
We used to...

13:34.688 --> 13:35.491
get together.

13:36.173 --> 13:44.142
All of the managers, the owners of the stores and me and some of my staff would get together maybe once a month and have a meal together.

13:44.645 --> 13:49.010
And it was no animosity and just good heads up business.

13:49.150 --> 13:59.000
We would always furnish them the book list free of charge so that they would have an equal shot at getting the books on the shelf in a timely manner.

14:00.041 --> 14:03.765
I've been told that that was not always the case.

14:03.785 --> 14:08.110
But when we went in, we felt that that was the fair way to do it.

14:08.290 --> 14:10.232
And the students benefited from it, of course.

14:10.733 --> 14:13.015
All right, during those years, describe

14:13.298 --> 14:19.644
the management style of Howard Vestal and Vice President Cherry?

14:19.664 --> 14:21.286
Two of the finest men you'll ever meet.

14:23.148 --> 14:33.538
Tom Cherry's philosophy was to hire people, good people, and then give them the resources to do with and then stay out of their way.

14:35.360 --> 14:42.968
Howard's method was somewhat similar to that, but he was a little bit more hands-on than Tom was.

14:43.538 --> 14:44.723
Uh, Howard,

14:45.563 --> 15:00.181
like frequent reports, was very astute on what should happen percentage-wise to sales, to expenses, to what have you, much more so than Mr. Cherry was.

15:01.283 --> 15:04.587
They just had different management styles, but Howard was much more hands-on.

15:05.528 --> 15:10.394
I felt, you know, keeping much closer tabs on what I did than Mr. Cherry did.

15:10.915 --> 15:14.119
Of course, Mr. Cherry was the next level up, and that would be to be expected.

15:15.263 --> 15:23.659
And I'm assuming because of his background and your Air Force Reserve, you and Howard Vestal had a good deal in common in terms of experience.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.044
Had an excellent, excellent relationship.

15:26.184 --> 15:35.162
In fact, when Howard came as Director of Auxiliary Enterprises, I had been the store manager for a period of several months.

15:35.142 --> 15:49.545
Mr. Cherry had tried one or two other guys as director of auxiliary services and they did not meet his satisfaction so he let them go almost before they got in the door good.

15:51.548 --> 16:02.145
In those days did any faculty group or dean or individual faculty member come over and try to decide something about the bookstore?

16:03.779 --> 16:05.261
Yes, but in a positive way.

16:05.321 --> 16:09.888
We had what we call the Exchange Store Advisory Committee.

16:10.749 --> 16:12.892
There was an English professor named Sid Cox.

16:13.693 --> 16:21.084
Sid Cox was the chairman of the Exchange Store Advisory Committee, and he felt about the bookstore the way Wayne Stark felt about the MSC.

16:21.104 --> 16:22.226
That was his bookstore.

16:23.327 --> 16:28.235
And he never interfered, but he spent a lot of time with us.

16:28.275 --> 16:29.617
He'd come over and drink coffee with us.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.980
The main job of the

16:32.483 --> 16:36.908
Exchange Store Advisory Committee was to distribute the profits that the store made.

16:37.289 --> 16:41.514
And in that role, he had a great deal of influence.

16:42.815 --> 16:52.006
I have no idea what happened, but for some reason, and I honestly do not remember who made the appointments to that committee, but he was not reappointed to the committee.

16:53.829 --> 16:54.730
And it hurt his feelings.

16:55.330 --> 16:56.852
Sid was a fairly wealthy man.

16:56.892 --> 16:59.555
He used to buy rent houses, and high-quality rent houses.

16:59.575 --> 17:01.798
He had over 30 houses at one time.

17:02.555 --> 17:10.788
And he told me that he had in his will that he had left all other than what his wife needed, that he had left no children.

17:10.808 --> 17:11.789
Well, I think he had one.

17:12.390 --> 17:13.812
I'm not sure if they had children or not.

17:14.233 --> 17:19.521
But he had left enough money in his will to pay for the new bookstore in the MSC.

17:20.262 --> 17:27.954
And when he got, when he was not reappointed, he changed his will and left A&M out of his will.

17:28.635 --> 17:30.638
It hurt his feelings so bad, so badly.

17:30.702 --> 17:38.813
As bookstore manager, what were the biggest frustrations and the biggest enjoyments for you?

17:39.014 --> 17:42.779
It was almost like being in business for myself.

17:44.822 --> 17:47.065
It was almost a line of staff organization.

17:47.165 --> 17:51.051
I was the manager, and then I had an assistant manager who had been there for a long time.

17:51.111 --> 17:56.338
I had a book department manager, and I had a clothing department manager, and I had a supplies department manager.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.684
and then they had people underneath them.

17:58.784 --> 18:03.589
So it was a line of staff organization, very similar to a military setup.

18:03.909 --> 18:07.433
But it was that way when I went in, so I didn't organize it that way.

18:08.253 --> 18:22.768
But I enjoy that type of an organization where you've got definite lines of responsibility so that if something goes right or something goes wrong, you can really go to the next guy down and find out what's wrong and then fix it.

18:23.709 --> 18:26.832
I never have been too much on committee managements and what have you.

18:27.655 --> 18:30.421
An organized way to postpone a decision as a committee.

18:31.102 --> 18:33.327
But I enjoyed that very much.

18:33.908 --> 18:42.646
Not a whole lot of frustration other than the fact that we had to be completely self-sufficient and some of those years we would just barely break even.

18:43.869 --> 18:45.753
And other years we'd make some nice profit.

18:46.514 --> 18:47.436
What were the biggest headaches?

18:48.682 --> 18:53.010
Headaches, of course, always would be school opening, trying to get the textbooks on the shelf.

18:54.232 --> 18:58.058
Getting book lists in from department heads was like pulling teeth.

18:58.760 --> 19:06.273
And, of course, their excuse would be, well, the people in the department have not told me what they want to use, and I can't give you the list until I find out from them.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.937
And the lead time when getting the books from the publisher would be long.

19:09.037 --> 19:11.702
Or they've come out with a new edition.

19:12.290 --> 19:41.436
and uh maybe the prof might not be aware of the fact that there's a new edition and he'd specify an old edition or you know just a lot of little things but nearly all of our real headaches revolved around textbooks which departments were the most and the least cooperative in supplying y'all with whatever you needed i really honestly don't recall i don't recall no i think it was pretty well widespread throughout the university it's

19:41.652 --> 19:45.118
And you served in that role about five years.

19:45.199 --> 19:45.920
About eight years.

19:46.020 --> 19:46.561
Eight years.

19:46.581 --> 19:46.822
Yes.

19:46.842 --> 19:49.747
So almost all of Mr. Rutter's time as president.

19:49.767 --> 19:50.027
Yes.

19:51.089 --> 19:56.860
Did you have any other interaction with him that we ought to include?

19:57.127 --> 19:59.995
Not on a personal basis other than those that I mentioned.

20:00.115 --> 20:07.034
My interview when I was hired and then the time he came over for our briefing on the status of the exchange store.

20:09.401 --> 20:12.469
When Earl was at Tarleton,

20:12.770 --> 20:14.833
he and Doc Burgle became friends.

20:15.754 --> 20:17.696
Burgle was the manager of that bookstore there.

20:18.377 --> 20:25.587
So when Earl came to A&M, he brought Doc in as the manager of the exchange store at the first opportunity he had.

20:25.627 --> 20:31.735
I'm sure he didn't, I don't think he fired anyone to give him the job, but the job was open and so he brought Doc down.

20:34.038 --> 20:37.242
You mentioned one ago the memorial service.

20:37.262 --> 20:37.542
Yes.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.705
Were you aware of his

20:39.989 --> 20:43.695
decline in health soon before his death?

20:43.935 --> 20:44.115
No.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.197
I wasn't either.

20:45.337 --> 20:47.140
I think it was a complete surprise to me.

20:49.143 --> 20:50.545
Are you aware of how old he was?

20:50.565 --> 20:52.147
59, wasn't he?

20:52.568 --> 20:54.611
One month short of his 60th birthday.

20:54.631 --> 20:54.891
Yes.

20:55.172 --> 20:58.757
Therefore did not qualify for Veterans Benefit.

20:59.041 --> 21:00.844
And you know, they've changed that now.

21:01.646 --> 21:14.991
Once you reach a vesting period, and I've forgotten just what it is, I think it's, I want to say 55, but I'm not sure.

21:15.376 --> 21:20.365
But there's a period from when you retire from the reserves and when you can start drawing your benefits.

21:20.385 --> 21:27.437
But once you reach that, had you lived, you would have qualified, then your widow can receive the benefits.

21:27.837 --> 21:33.287
And I don't know, obviously they probably didn't make that retroactive, so Margaret probably never really received any benefits.

21:33.307 --> 21:37.654
I think that's correct, because as I understand, Mr. Teague, given all the influence he had,

21:38.039 --> 21:40.923
tried to get an exception made and could not.

21:40.943 --> 21:43.186
Well, if he couldn't do it, no one could at that time.

21:44.067 --> 21:46.551
So you're appointed next.

21:46.831 --> 21:47.773
What's the next task?

21:47.793 --> 21:51.918
Okay, the next task was when the University Center Complex opened up.

21:52.700 --> 22:01.211
I was appointed as director of the University Center Complex, which was a collective name for the MSC, Rudder Tower, and the Theater Complex.

22:01.732 --> 22:03.895
Those three collectively were called the University Center.

22:03.995 --> 22:05.177
But you did not have

22:05.663 --> 22:29.764
responsibility for the bookstore anymore well when we when the bookstore first opened in the new location where it is now i was still the manager of the bookstore for approximately four months and then uh howard vestal and tom cherry appointed me as director of the entire operation well let me let me include the bookstore it included the bookstore right now it

22:31.010 --> 22:34.643
Actually, the decision was made before I moved to the new building.

22:34.663 --> 22:38.497
I knew when I moved in that as soon as everything was complete.

22:38.778 --> 22:40.885
Now, we moved into the bookstore

22:41.152 --> 22:45.237
the theater center and part of Rudder Tower was still under construction.

22:45.958 --> 22:53.347
So it was understood that I was going to be in charge of the whole thing, but the whole thing was not ready for occupancy at that time.

22:53.928 --> 22:56.852
So I was still the manager of the bookstore for a short period of time.

22:58.494 --> 23:04.461
But then I was director of the University Center Complex for approximately two years.

23:05.583 --> 23:10.669
And that's when this interaction with Wayne Stark came up that I mentioned to you that he was really

23:10.649 --> 23:15.054
really distressed the fact that he was no longer in charge of the facilities themselves.

23:15.254 --> 23:20.139
But we had such a close working relationship that he accepted that and there was not really a problem.

23:22.581 --> 23:26.205
And were both, Mr. Cherry was still active or had he retired by then?

23:26.225 --> 23:31.811
No, he was still the vice president for business affairs and Howard Vestal was the director of auxiliary enterprises.

23:32.732 --> 23:37.737
And then I was there for two years and then Tom Cherry retired.

23:38.476 --> 23:44.267
Howard Vestal moved into the Vice President for Business Affairs, and I moved into Howard's old job.

23:45.209 --> 23:46.491
And we changed the name of it.

23:46.651 --> 23:53.701
From that time, it was Director of Auxiliary Enterprises, but at the time I moved into it, we changed it to Director of Business Services.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.105
And that included what?

23:56.125 --> 24:10.626
And that included everything I had, which is the University Center Complex, food services, the airport, the golf course, the dormitories, shuttle bus operation, physical plant,

24:11.872 --> 24:12.533
No, it didn't.

24:13.153 --> 24:14.395
It didn't include the physical plant.

24:14.515 --> 24:15.436
I'm sorry, that's later on.

24:17.038 --> 24:17.939
That's basically it.

24:18.139 --> 24:29.833
Do you remember when you took that responsibility, anything about the dimensions in terms of number of employees and total dollars involved and so forth?

24:30.153 --> 24:38.723
I had about, at that point, I had about 1,500 employees

24:39.158 --> 24:40.782
Most of them in food services.

24:41.143 --> 24:43.229
Food services was a big, was a big.

24:43.309 --> 24:47.520
Fred Dollar had a tremendous operation, and he reported to me at that point.

24:48.583 --> 24:49.325
Now, I take it back.

24:49.385 --> 24:53.114
We had over 2,000 in the organization at that time.

24:53.134 --> 24:54.518
Remember what the budget was?

24:55.274 --> 24:56.055
Have no idea.

24:56.075 --> 24:58.197
It was broken down incrementally.

24:58.237 --> 25:07.407
I know that the physical plant, I'm getting my jobs mixed up because when I was vice president for operations, the physical plant reported to me.

25:07.527 --> 25:13.433
But as director of business services, the job I had previous to that, he still reported directly to Howard.

25:14.274 --> 25:21.822
In either of those jobs, which of those was not self-sustaining in terms of income?

25:21.987 --> 25:27.317
Okay, when I was director of business services, those were still all auxiliary enterprises.

25:27.697 --> 25:29.481
We didn't get a penny of money anywhere.

25:30.122 --> 25:40.561
We had to generate it all, from dormitories fees, or student service fees, or room and board fees, and of course the bookstore, all those had to be self-sustaining.

25:41.382 --> 25:43.506
Which of those...

25:44.937 --> 25:47.140
Did each of them separately stand alone?

25:47.240 --> 25:47.520
Yes.

25:48.161 --> 25:48.382
Okay.

25:48.402 --> 25:48.502
Yes.

25:49.543 --> 25:55.551
Now, there was the business services account was 40110.

25:55.832 --> 25:57.013
I don't know why I remember that number.

25:58.455 --> 26:07.647
But as the profits were generated from these various activities, each fiscal year started off from ground zero with new appropriations.

26:07.708 --> 26:14.016
But once the budget was appropriated, then we were expected to and usually have

26:14.553 --> 26:41.607
money left at the end of the year that money was transferred into auxiliary enterprise auxiliary enterprises administration reserve which is account 41110 that was the best kept secret on the campus there were millions and millions of dollars in that account until this day i would say there are millions of dollars in that account it's where robert smith had a lot of power because he controlled that account and that could be used to bail out

26:42.312 --> 26:44.155
almost anything on the campus.

26:44.175 --> 26:44.676
Pretty close.

26:45.177 --> 26:45.838
Legally?

26:45.858 --> 26:46.199
Legally.

26:46.459 --> 26:50.246
It was what we call local funds as opposed to appropriated funds.

26:51.188 --> 26:58.480
And the president and the vice president for business affairs had great discretion on what to use that money for.

27:00.424 --> 27:04.050
Describe working for Vice President Vestal.

27:04.402 --> 27:05.583
was a real experience.

27:06.124 --> 27:15.453
I consider Howard to be the reason for every promotion I had since the day I met him because every time he'd get a promotion, I'd take his old job.

27:16.434 --> 27:34.392
And right on up, you know, after I was director of business services, when he went in as vice president, then he created a position a couple years later, about a year and a half later, of associate vice president for business affairs and moved me into that position.

27:35.165 --> 27:48.202
And then when he retired, I moved in and when Frank Vanderbilt was there, then I moved in to the Vice President's position and the name was changed from Vice President for Business Affairs to Vice President for Operations.

27:48.802 --> 27:54.530
Now that was the point, up until that time, the fiscal office was under the Vice President for Business Affairs.

27:55.491 --> 28:03.501
And Frank and Art Blair and I sat down and we talked about the position.

28:04.055 --> 28:19.756
And we all agreed that there might be some merit into splitting that up and letting the Vice President for Fiscal Affairs be a direct reporting agency to the President.

28:19.776 --> 28:22.520
And that's when Eddie Joe Davis came in.

28:23.321 --> 28:25.444
Frank sent me to Dallas to talk.

28:25.464 --> 28:28.628
I met Eddie Joe at Love Field at the airport.

28:28.608 --> 28:34.463
and had the authority from Frank to make him an offer to come down and be the Vice President for Fiscal Affairs.

28:34.484 --> 28:40.339
Of course, he was the Vice President for Fiscal Affairs for Frank at North Texas, so Frank, it was a known quantity that Frank was getting.

28:41.382 --> 28:48.558
And so I talked with Eddie Joe, and he said, well, he said, you know, I'd really love to come back to A&M.

28:48.759 --> 28:53.229
Having been a cadet colonel of the Corps, he had some deep, deep roots at A&M.

28:53.469 --> 28:57.518
And so to make a long story short, he accepted the job.

28:58.060 --> 28:59.543
But when he came down, that

28:59.843 --> 29:07.171
that separated that tremendous power that Tom Cherry had and that Vice President Vestal had.

29:07.231 --> 29:13.557
And there was never a bobble of any controversy or anything during the time they had all that power.

29:16.120 --> 29:28.973
But by separating those two positions, it diluted the power of that position because it separated the fiscal office from the rest of the activity.

29:29.999 --> 29:39.491
Theoretically, when they were combined, that vice president had the authority to make a request from one side and approve it from the other side.

29:40.112 --> 29:44.517
In other words, he would, you know, total authority.

29:46.019 --> 29:51.366
But by separating them, if I needed something, then Eddie Joe was a balance.

29:51.869 --> 29:55.273
to say, you know, we can both go to the president and I can say, well, I need this.

29:55.313 --> 30:00.258
And Eddie Joe says, well, you know, if we do that, these are going to be the ramifications.

30:00.278 --> 30:08.667
Otherwise, the president would never know that there was a problem because I'd make the decision because I had both sets of cards in my hands.

30:09.548 --> 30:19.058
Well, then when Eddie Joe moved on to the systems building, then Robert Smith inherited that position.

30:20.624 --> 30:22.166
Let me back up now.

30:23.467 --> 30:25.669
Okay.

30:25.689 --> 30:27.091
I want to make sure I'm telling this right.

30:29.373 --> 30:31.055
Okay, my mind's clear now.

30:31.555 --> 30:36.240
When I was there, when Eddie Joe was there, we were both vice presidents, both reporting to Frank.

30:36.260 --> 30:44.909
When I retired, they rolled those positions back into one position under Eddie Joe, just the way it was when Tom Cherry and Howard Vestal were there.

30:45.089 --> 30:47.391
They consolidated those all back under Eddie Joe.

30:47.843 --> 30:53.069
Then when he left, Robert Smith came in and took the position while they were still all consolidated.

30:53.549 --> 30:59.156
Then when Robert left, they split them back apart again, which is what they are now, which is what I think they should be.

30:59.396 --> 31:00.738
You think that's the better arrangement?

31:00.758 --> 31:01.839
No question in my mind.

31:01.999 --> 31:06.965
There's too much chance for, that's too much power for one person to have.

31:07.305 --> 31:12.931
Should they both be of equal status and both report to the president?

31:13.092 --> 31:13.953
I think so, yes.

31:14.433 --> 31:14.954
I think so.

31:15.154 --> 31:16.956
All right, let's go back then in years.

31:17.375 --> 31:23.522
Then you get up there at the top level at about the time Dr. Williams arrives?

31:26.305 --> 31:27.747
Calhoun, the chief academic officer?

31:28.167 --> 31:31.651
No, I was director of business services at that time.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.214
Now wait a minute.

31:34.234 --> 31:39.720
This is 19, Williams gets here November 1, 1970.
