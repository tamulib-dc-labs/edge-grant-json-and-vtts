WEBVTT

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.604
Well, Kramer's German history.

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:11.447
And he also taught survey.

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:12.689
David had him.

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.971
He thought he was great.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.085
Other than the two of us, there weren't many others.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.608
I'm trying to do these by segments or by years.

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:48.158
Victor was a very popular teacher.

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:48.758
Victor Treat?

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.701
Yeah.

00:00:50.721 --> 00:01:01.658
People used to fuss about Castalonic, but I know people take two or three of his courses once they get used to his accent.

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.142
Who were thought to be the toughest graders?

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.881
I think Beaumont's considered.

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:18.083
Roger Beaumont.

00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:32.667
That'd be military history, wouldn't it?

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:32.968
In the survey.

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:34.210
The answer was a hard grader.

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:38.797
Because he would have had to have the footnote tell most of these questions.

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:40.440
Was there anybody supposedly easy?

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:46.441
I think Tom Miller was easy.

00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:47.665
That's just the impression.

00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:51.275
And then way back under Jock Woods in government?

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:54.263
In government, yes.

00:01:55.747 --> 00:01:56.168
It was easy.

00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:09.994
Of course, that's been too long.

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:12.158
We've been divided too long.

00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:13.140
You know, Kwan Road.

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.564
You know, Kwan and Poli-Sci.

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:18.389
I don't think it was easy, but it wasn't that hard.

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:28.147
There were a number of folks that, after we got a divorce, came to Poli-Sci that were considered easy.

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:31.453
We're just sticking to history.

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.707
OK, all right.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.629
Now, I don't have many more questions left.

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:50.452
What have we not covered that we should have of all?

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:58.880
Oh, what extracurricular groups, organizations, activities did you take part in?

00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:04.945
There was non-academic, but university.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:11.211
I don't know how many years I was an outfit advisor.

00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:12.956
describe what that meant.

00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:26.162
You go to the dorm, I picked, I had these wedding nights, and whatever outfit you were with, come to see, for example, you would knock on the doors of freshmen and just visit with them and ask them what's on their mind or what's bothering them.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:31.773
Usually by the 34th week, a number have gotten Dear John letters, have gotten flush letters.

00:03:31.973 --> 00:03:37.061
You could almost mark your calendar by October and November.

00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:37.502
Oh, I see.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:38.123
This is good.

00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:39.445
I don't have this before.

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:40.627
I tried.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.976
I say you could almost mark the calendar.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:52.605
And then you visit them by their academic, by whatever personal problem that you were born to.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:56.809
For quite a few years, I was a school advisor.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.996
I don't remember how many years, but quite a few.

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:06.159
I sat down one time and counted how many different committees.

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:18.492
I was always 22, but, you know, six or seven of them would be graduate committees, the rest would be college or university or others, I'm thinking whatever, whatever.

00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:23.132
Everything.

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:32.865
I was on the road selection committee, the Truman Scholarship and the Marshall Scholarship.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:34.587
I did the study of college scholarships.

00:04:34.947 --> 00:04:40.795
I did it for many years.

00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:42.598
I've already indicated it was an active operations committee.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.321
I had eight people.

00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.603
You hear that?

00:04:46.623 --> 00:04:49.386
That TV comes on by itself sometimes.

00:04:49.406 --> 00:04:50.588
Do you know why?

00:04:51.243 --> 00:05:12.661
As you look back over all these years, what were the most joyful moments, the high points?

00:05:14.284 --> 00:05:15.065
At the university?

00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:15.546
Yeah.

00:05:17.737 --> 00:05:24.847
Well, for my, you know, professionals, a rather high point to be given the opportunity to do academic services.

00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:42.192
Not that I was tired of teaching, never got tired of doing that, but it was an opportunity to move beyond the departmental status and become directly involved in some of the larger issues of the university, and especially since I felt rather strongly

00:05:42.593 --> 00:06:08.331
about the general studies program and what opportunities it gave to students and also a long time feeling that new faculty started throwing up the rules and given the opportunity to create a program, a week-long program, that hopefully would enhance the ability of the new faculty to integrate into the community.

00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:17.247
I guess I just like being what is, because since we came in 56, I've never regretted it.

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:20.052
I've never had any real desire to go anyplace else.

00:06:22.035 --> 00:06:23.257
I've been comfortable here.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:27.945
University has been generally good to me.

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:36.259
In anyone's long-term career, there are some ups and some downs, and my journey were up.

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:43.369
And we often say how different our life would have been had we stayed at the Citadel.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.216
But as it was, we came here and it's been a full life.

00:06:48.737 --> 00:06:51.781
We got out of here from heaven to work at the University of Biochemistry.

00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:57.109
And we like who we are and what we've been.

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:03.057
If you had all the people that you've been associated with at A&M present,

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:07.943
to which ones would you most want to express appreciation?

00:07:11.687 --> 00:07:15.751
Ralph Steen, you know, for hiring me.

00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:16.892
That was important to me.

00:07:18.734 --> 00:07:20.516
Chuck McCandless and Mike Prescott.

00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:24.680
You know, there was no academic service.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.246
It was created that summer at their initiative.

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:33.229
And I assume that Jarvis approved since it happened.

00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:47.583
And I really appreciate the fact that essentially Chuck, after several talks with him, gave me the opportunity to have that position.

00:07:47.603 --> 00:07:52.332
And as far as my history colleagues are concerned,

00:07:53.948 --> 00:08:04.965
For most of them, I have nothing but the highest regard and respect, and I would say thank you to people like Charles Wines.

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:14.940
We were office mates in the reserve together, and Victor and Haskell and Al Ashcraft, and I miss them a great deal.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:22.251
Roy Taylor, he's on the Cougar way, was a very, very unusual person.

00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:41.744
Let's make believe that you have been hired as a consultant now to advise the department and the college and the institution about what it ought to do now and in the future.

00:08:42.164 --> 00:08:45.048
You mean if I was a Chuck McCandless, I'd rule the world for a day?

00:08:45.068 --> 00:08:46.610
Yes, yes, that's right.

00:08:46.831 --> 00:08:47.812
Is that his expression?

00:08:47.832 --> 00:08:48.553
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:50.095
I'd rule the world for a day.

00:08:54.597 --> 00:09:08.401
Well, I think despite all the studies, and I don't know the details of all of them, I sometimes feel and sense that it has lost what I thought was very important.

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:15.132
That was true in the 50s and 60s, as well as the 70s and 80s.

00:09:15.974 --> 00:09:19.660
It may be a function of size.

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:23.099
I don't really like the word family.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.562
That always bothers me.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:32.534
They talk about the A&M family and I still see it in the newspapers and the TV news all the time.

00:09:32.554 --> 00:09:43.150
But I think that to the degree that the department and the university has lost its ability

00:09:44.615 --> 00:10:09.898
for the faculty to appreciate, I mean in fact in the broad sense, to appreciate and I don't want to say love each other, but at least respect each other and without what I see a good deal of backbiting, stabbing, and what have you.

00:10:09.918 --> 00:10:12.580
I also feel rather strongly that

00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:24.146
And I don't know who all the senior administrators are, but I would certainly hope that the University would make any changes at the higher levels in the near future.

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:38.489
Would have someone in the institution as their chief administrative officers who have a better sense of what it is and what its direction should be.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:40.592
I really feel in the last two years,

00:10:40.994 --> 00:10:46.617
of the selection process is not the University of Justice and the people that have been chosen.

00:10:48.503 --> 00:10:51.926
Is there something special about A&M as an institution?

00:10:52.187 --> 00:10:52.967
If so, what?

00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:56.331
Well, it grows on you, whatever that speciality is, if that's a good word.

00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:16.030
You know I have two degrees from the University of Texas and one from Arkansas, but when it gets down to the degree for A&M and not the others, I don't think I've recounted, but while we were in the Southwest Conference,

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:23.123
Before we played the Arkansas game, I would teach my students how to call the hogs.

00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:26.910
And though they would make glaring, they apparently got pretty good charge out of it.

00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:31.838
But I never did try to teach them about UT.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:39.452
I thought it may be safer with Arkansas and just a bit easier to do call the hogs and whatever it may be.

00:11:39.432 --> 00:11:45.678
But in how many years we've been around, it's been a joy and a pleasure.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.941
And I wouldn't change.

00:11:49.562 --> 00:11:53.867
So what feelings do you carry in your heart for A&M today?

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.332
It's sad to say I've seen some people retire.

00:11:59.372 --> 00:12:02.996
Maybe they were forced to retire, which I was not.

00:12:04.237 --> 00:12:07.701
And their bitter is much like your earlier question.

00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:13.634
which senior administrators left on the card, some with a greater or lesser degree.

00:12:15.076 --> 00:12:20.583
But as far as the institution, I have a great love for it and a great sense of its well-being.

00:12:21.284 --> 00:12:23.587
That's why I'm terribly troubled in the last two years.

00:12:24.408 --> 00:12:31.517
Almost every time I pick up the newspaper, there's something in there that hurts the university and what I perceive it to be and what I would like for it to be.

00:12:32.698 --> 00:12:37.384
As I said earlier, it's been good to us and my family.

00:12:39.406 --> 00:12:48.391
Any change that I would vote and recommend, and I may sound like a reactionary, but a little bit of the good old times, whatever they were.

00:12:48.973 --> 00:12:50.457
Of course, that's a relative expression.

00:12:50.738 --> 00:12:53.505
What do you mean by it?

00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:54.107
Let's quit there.
