WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.711
Texas A&M since 1969.

00:06.334 --> 00:09.078
It's November the 13th, Friday. Okay. And I'm 
interviewing Dr. Shules, who has been at Texas A&M

00:10.560 --> 00:15.167
since 1969. That's correct. And has been in the 
Department of Educational Curriculum and

00:16.909 --> 00:26.342
Instruction and is still a professor here, among a 
lot of other things that he does. I'd like to talk to

00:27.014 --> 00:38.930
you, Dr. Schuetz, about the major changes that you 
have experienced or have you been a part of since

00:27.014 --> 00:38.930
you came to Texas A&M, some of the causes that you 
feel might have brought about these changes. And

00:39.751 --> 00:43.717
then we'll talk a little bit about the goals or the 
mission of the college. So looking back to 1969

00:44.878 --> 00:49.845
when you arrived, from Stanford? No, you went? I 
was in Palo Alto Unified School District. in

00:55.921 --> 00:57.563
California. But I did my doctoral study and 
master's study at Stanford. Right. OK. And was

01:02.289 --> 01:07.054
Dean Hubert responsible for you coming here? Dean 
Hubert and Glenn Johnson. I had somebody quote or

01:12.140 --> 01:20.851
tell me that 90% of the people that Dean Hubert had 
hired were still here and were still productive.

01:21.531 --> 01:24.595
And when I wrote that up in one of my class reports, 
Dr. Erlandson said, have you verified this or

01:25.283 --> 01:31.208
triangulated and make sure? And I haven't gone 
through the records, and I guess I'll have to. It

01:34.451 --> 01:38.915
might have just been something that this person 
just assumed or just from thinking. I don't know if

01:38.995 --> 01:47.362
90% was an accurate figure, but there are quite a 
few people in the College of Education today that

01:38.995 --> 01:47.362
were here. In fact, all of my interviews so far have 
been people that were here, and it was like over 20.

01:54.292 --> 01:56.536
And that's amazing. And, of course, the college is 
not that old, but still, we're going to be hitting

01:56.556 --> 02:01.063
20 years pretty soon. That's right. This is its 
19th year. And it's been tremendous fun to be in a

02:02.966 --> 02:12.500
ground floor of a whole new institution. The 
College of Education was born in 1969. The

02:16.447 --> 02:19.371
Department of Curriculum and Instruction was 
born in 1969. And all of the The structure,

02:23.198 --> 02:35.229
the precedents for the college had to be 
established. That's right. And if a person had

02:35.530 --> 02:49.543
gone to the University of Illinois or Stanford or 
someplace where the precedents had been 50 or 100

02:35.530 --> 02:49.543
years old, you would have waited for 50 years to get 
a chance to influence something. But those of us

02:50.030 --> 02:55.876
who came in 69 had a chance to start right in doing 
it. And it was great fun. We took on

02:57.799 --> 03:04.166
responsibilities that were more than we knew how 
to handle. But we learned. I still remember Gwen

03:07.029 --> 03:10.693
Johnson, the first year as department head. He had 
so much to learn, he just couldn't do it all. And he

03:15.118 --> 03:19.783
would stay up all night long trying to get things 
done. And he would go home and take a shower and

03:19.983 --> 03:26.370
shave, come back to work at 6 o'clock in the 
morning. And we just got on his case. I told him he

03:30.195 --> 03:31.296
just couldn't do that. But he would keep saying, I 
have to know these things. I have to be responsible

03:36.662 --> 03:39.706
for these things. I was not aware that the 
Department of EDCI was also born at the same time.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.452
Tell me a little bit about how that came about. 
Well, before the College of Education was born,

03:49.312 --> 03:52.597
There was, in the College of Liberal Arts, a 
Department of Education. There was, in the

03:54.460 --> 03:59.908
College of Agriculture, a Department of 
Agricultural Education. There was a Department

03:59.928 --> 04:02.051
of Health and Physical Education. I'm not sure 
where it was housed. It might have been in Liberal

04:03.253 --> 04:07.118
Arts, but I don't know. And then one in Engineering 
as well. And that was Industrial Arts. When the

04:12.835 --> 04:26.472
college came into being, the Department of 
Education split into educational

04:12.835 --> 04:26.472
administration, curriculum and instruction, 
and educational psychology.

04:28.514 --> 04:39.568
And then after that,

04:28.514 --> 04:39.568
at the same time, industrial education moved over 
to education from engineering.

04:41.708 --> 04:46.653
And after that time, we invented 
interdisciplinary education. And things like

04:48.314 --> 04:54.760
adult education and vocational education 
somehow got added in, and educational technology

04:48.314 --> 04:54.760
got added in. When you say we invented, what kind of 
process did you go through, or how did this come

04:55.021 --> 05:00.386
about? Was it the faculty as a whole interacting 
with the dean to try to meet the needs at works? How

05:07.112 --> 05:10.315
did that happen?

05:10.919 --> 05:12.441
It wasn't the faculty as a whole. It wasn't all the 
departments involved. It wasn't all the

05:14.945 --> 05:16.508
departments in the college. It was the ones that 
were particularly involved. There were

05:19.473 --> 05:36.640
funding agencies that were asking for proposals 
or where there were funds available to get things

05:19.473 --> 05:36.640
started up, particularly vocational education 
is something that I remember. or where there was

05:38.071 --> 05:50.224
some new development as in educational 
technology that one particular department, in

05:38.071 --> 05:50.224
this case, industrial education, felt was 
important. So they simply tacked on to themselves

05:50.244 --> 06:05.361
this

05:50.244 --> 06:05.361
activity that didn't have a direct relationship 
to their ongoing traditional program. But yes,

06:06.117 --> 06:18.330
department heads, faculty members were well 
involved in working with the dean, talking with

06:06.117 --> 06:18.330
the dean about such developments. And he was 
always looking for ways to encourage the

06:19.271 --> 06:35.027
strengthening and attention of the application 
and its horizons.

06:36.442 --> 06:47.116
There have been, and I'm going to divide this into 
the two distinct administrations, you know,

06:36.442 --> 06:47.116
Hubert for 10 years almost, and then now Dean 
Corrigan since 1980. Were there changes in the

06:49.339 --> 06:58.110
focus of, you know, the mission is still the same, 
the teaching and research and the service. Was

06:59.072 --> 07:05.520
that in equal proportion in the two eras, or has it 
changed any?

07:08.150 --> 07:12.498
As far as more emphasis on either teaching or 
research or service? The emphasis has changed. I

07:16.184 --> 07:18.428
think the methodology has changed. I think the 
tile of leadership has changed. The measures of

07:25.240 --> 07:28.827
success have maybe changed. You have to remember, 
Dean Hubert came to the Deanship in Education

07:32.888 --> 07:39.694
after a preceding decade as the Dean of Liberal 
Arts. And before that, the Dean of Arts and

07:39.815 --> 07:41.816
Sciences. And so he had a view of the possible based 
upon

07:43.278 --> 08:02.676
considerable history of time with an institution 
that was pretty conservative in its outlook and

07:43.278 --> 08:02.676
its operation. he kind of brought that into his 
leadership in the College of Education

08:02.943 --> 08:29.419
transcended the conservatism to the degree that 
he had visions of development and expansion that

08:02.943 --> 08:29.419
went way beyond what other deans would have 
thought about, I'm sure, in terms of the College of

08:02.943 --> 08:29.419
Education. Corrigan came in with a completely 
different set of experiences, different

08:30.854 --> 08:40.491
institutions, and things that Dean Huber would 
have said, no, it can't be done to. Corrigan has

08:41.493 --> 08:43.357
said, I'm going to find out. That's the way we used 
to do it in Massachusetts or Vermont or wherever he

08:43.817 --> 08:49.448
came from.

08:51.892 --> 08:54.617
Right.

08:55.424 --> 09:01.374
He never took no for an answer, so to speak, at the 
beginning of things. He always took the more

09:01.414 --> 09:06.722
optimistic view. And whereas Dean Hubert was 
insistent that we had to be getting into the

09:07.323 --> 09:19.002
research and development game with outside 
funding, his measure of success was pretty much

09:19.893 --> 09:27.582
the dollars attracted. Hubert's was? Yes. Okay. 
And I think that's rather natural when you're

09:30.626 --> 09:36.272
beginning something. You say, well, how are we 
doing? Well, how many bucks have we got?

09:43.121 --> 09:47.706
But as the college has matured some, I think... 
faculty began to be ready to reach out in different

09:48.142 --> 09:55.453
directions and to make different kinds of 
proposals. And so I think the quality of some of

09:56.695 --> 10:08.213
these activities, the originality or creativity 
in them has improved to some degree. At least the

10:08.233 --> 10:10.977
diversity in them has improved. And I don't mean 
saying that to disparage the work and effort of

10:11.716 --> 10:18.986
people in the first 10 years at all. I just need to 
say that the critical mass got bigger and all of a

10:19.827 --> 10:26.836
sudden we were able to do things that we couldn't do 
before. You mentioned the measure of success.

10:33.004 --> 10:34.686
How is success measured now? I think it is getting 
more and more to be the degree to which we influence

10:35.948 --> 10:58.691
public policy or professional points of view or 
the thinking, the philosophy, or the point of view

10:35.948 --> 10:58.691
within the disciplines we represent. In other 
words, are we visible in our specialties

10:58.711 --> 11:05.618
nationally?

11:06.897 --> 11:12.324
How does the college measure in that area? Well, if 
you compare us in 1969 to 1989, it's day and night.

11:20.415 --> 11:27.344
But I'm quick to say that some of the same people who 
were here in 1969 are the ones who are leading the

11:20.415 --> 11:27.344
way in 1989. But they've had time to grow. A lot of 
them who carried a lot of the heavy responsibility

11:33.998 --> 11:52.720
for organization and operation and 
administrative roles in those years have since

11:33.998 --> 11:52.720
phased out of those and gone into other things and 
they have then found the time to do some research

11:33.998 --> 11:52.720
and development and writing and so on that they 
didn't have time to do them.

11:54.162 --> 11:59.348
I think we have been able to attract more and more 
competent already competent people. We have

12:01.837 --> 12:24.062
actually recruited a number of people at the 
associate and full professor levels whose

12:01.837 --> 12:24.062
accomplishments have already been highly 
visible and brought them in to supplement what we

12:01.837 --> 12:24.062
were home growing as well. And I think the 
combination, the mix, has been very, very

12:24.983 --> 12:28.086
successful. I think that the college has kind of 
grown up in that period of time. Its position

12:35.533 --> 12:42.003
within the university has improved steadily. Its 
recognition has grown.

12:47.551 --> 12:59.288
A number of people from the college who have served 
on university-wide committees and councils of

12:47.551 --> 12:59.288
one kind or another are responsible for improving 
the image of education. We've been around long

13:03.572 --> 13:20.415
enough to have served, particularly graduate 
faculty members, as graduate council

13:03.572 --> 13:20.415
representatives and sometimes outside members 
on committees in other departments, and we have

13:03.572 --> 13:20.415
earned the respect of our colleagues in those 
roles.

13:24.243 --> 13:40.126
Our graduates, or let's say our students, our 
majors, have been improving in quality and

13:24.243 --> 13:40.126
accomplishment, and they compete effectively 
with other students in the university. I remember

13:40.888 --> 13:45.915
a marvelous, marvelous event. Well, at least a 
decade. Then Vice President for Academic

13:49.620 --> 13:52.765
Affairs, John Calhoun, noted that there were too 
many education majors graduating cum laude,

13:53.521 --> 14:03.053
magna cum laude, and summa cum laude, in his 
opinion. He called Dean Hubert over and he said,

14:03.073 --> 14:08.060
Hubert, your standards are too low. You got too 
many kids that are graduating with all these high

14:08.080 --> 14:14.128
honors. So Hubert came back and worked with Dr. 
Limbacher, who was then his associate dean.

14:22.816 --> 14:32.851
determined that the high grades these students 
were making were in the liberal arts and the

14:22.816 --> 14:32.851
sciences and the geosciences and not just in 
education. He took that information back and

14:32.991 --> 14:39.441
shoved it under Calhoun's nose and Calhoun shut 
up. It was the quality of the kids. Not that they

14:42.105 --> 14:48.675
were being given an easy road.

14:48.695 --> 14:51.439
And that has enhanced our

14:51.740 --> 14:56.387
reputation around the university. There are 
still people in the university that look down on

14:56.848 --> 15:02.717
people in education. That's because, I guess, 
they have to look down on somebody or to feel good

15:02.737 --> 15:08.285
about themselves.

15:11.309 --> 15:15.295
You're referring to other colleges, people in 
other colleges within the university. Yes.

15:15.736 --> 15:20.363
Anybody who is from education is automatically 
poorly educated, less competent, more limited in

15:20.849 --> 15:29.707
world view, and culture, and you name it. Are they 
verbal? I mean, are they vocal about that? Or is it

15:32.974 --> 15:34.217
just a feeling? Oftentimes. And it's only one in 
public forums, one kind or another, committees or

15:36.374 --> 16:00.647
councils, where the representative of education 
carries the day by the force of will and logic and

15:36.374 --> 16:00.647
precedent and argument and good persuasion that 
they begin to take notice and say, well, gee whiz,

15:36.374 --> 16:00.647
maybe they're not so stupid over there after all.

16:03.892 --> 16:05.554
Well, okay, then... You're talking a lot about 
collaboration and work with departments and

16:05.770 --> 16:09.676
committees. To what extent does the College of 
Education, in your opinion, collaborate with,

16:10.297 --> 16:20.051
well, within the college with departments and 
outside of the college with other colleges? Do you

16:20.091 --> 16:25.138
feel there's a lot, a little, or more than, I know 
probably more than you used to?

16:29.665 --> 16:33.070
That's a hard one to answer, Sylvia. I don't think 
we are as You're active across departmental lines

16:37.529 --> 16:42.475
as we ought to be. I don't know why. We're busy. All 
of us are busy. Let me just show you. This door has

16:50.323 --> 16:54.988
files of all the doctoral committees I'm on. And 
I'm cheering now, what is

16:55.008 --> 17:02.156
it? Looks like about 14. And I'm serving on another 
I'm

17:07.820 --> 17:11.943
on a GCR on two. And I'm on four or five master's 
committees. Is that a norm? I mean, is that an

17:21.211 --> 17:24.174
average for this college? Or is it something about 
your expertise that so many of the students want

17:24.254 --> 17:31.240
you on their committees? Well, I think it's not 
evenly divided. Not everybody in every

17:38.026 --> 17:49.457
department is so

17:38.026 --> 17:49.457
occupied with committee memberships, but a great 
many people are. In your department, there are so

17:49.477 --> 17:59.567
many students and so few faculty members that by 
definition, they're all going to be on umpteen

17:49.477 --> 17:59.567
committees.

18:00.008 --> 18:04.152
In this department, there are or maybe eight or 
nine of us that have a heavy, heavy load of doctoral

18:05.093 --> 18:14.762
students, either as chairs or memberships. And 
then some of the other specializations, there are

18:14.782 --> 18:22.048
enough people to share them fairly well. When you 
take on a doctoral student, have you any idea of

18:22.068 --> 18:27.753
what the average amount of time? I know it takes, 
what, a couple of years for that person to get

18:27.873 --> 18:33.278
through all the coursework and the dissertation, 
et cetera. But in terms of time, I know besides the

18:33.899 --> 18:49.134
committees, I mean, the defenses and the regular 
meetings with all the committee, how much time

18:33.899 --> 18:49.134
does it take with each student for counseling, for 
review? Those whose committees you chair

18:49.334 --> 18:58.142
takes, by definition, quite a bit of time. Because 
first, you're going to do a degree plan with its

18:58.162 --> 19:02.286
contents and the committee membership. That has 
to be done. Then you're going to deal, eventually,

19:05.212 --> 19:11.725
with dissertation proposal, and that goes 
through several drafts, and then of course it goes

19:05.212 --> 19:11.725
through another. There's the mind, and the chair 
pushes the mind, until it finally gets kind of

19:11.746 --> 19:20.764
gelled. dissertation proper, the reviewing of 
chapters one at a time, that's just time

19:21.301 --> 19:26.429
consuming. That's all it is. And candidates come 
with greater or lesser degrees of competence in

19:28.232 --> 19:38.788
writing, experience in writing. Some people have 
never written more than ten pages in their lives.

19:42.954 --> 19:48.743
Tackle something that's going to be sixty to a 
hundred pages long. Their sense of organization

19:49.617 --> 19:53.021
is just non-existent. They can't think of it as an 
argument that starts on page one and finishes on

19:53.041 --> 19:58.788
page 99 or whatever it is. I had one dean, one of the 
deans tell me that he felt that it was unfair or that

20:01.091 --> 20:14.848
it was not right to have people have that many 
committees, that it was a great concern of his that

20:01.091 --> 20:14.848
four or five committee or rather graduate 
students should be a max, and of course there's no,

20:15.605 --> 20:24.455
that's probably not realistic, but is there talk 
about limiting? We've got, in fact, a college, if

20:24.555 --> 20:33.284
not policy, at least a guideline for how many 
committees one should serve on. I think there are

20:33.384 --> 20:39.831
10 as a maximum, and serving on another 10 is 
exactly what it is. I look it up periodically and I

20:39.851 --> 20:41.493
forget it. But I have finished saying that If just 
with those things, the degree plan, the proposal,

20:45.085 --> 21:00.224
and the dissertation, then you have preparation 
for those tests, getting the candidate aware of

20:45.085 --> 21:00.224
how it's going to go, what's going to happen, and 
who's going to say what. And then there may very

21:01.626 --> 21:09.176
well be some independent study activities, some 
685s. And that takes time. Oh, but it's nice. The

21:15.241 --> 21:21.749
thing that's hard to predict is how much 
dependence the candidate will have on you. Some of

21:21.769 --> 21:26.195
them require inordinate amounts of time. And 
others do everything themselves and show you a

21:26.215 --> 21:33.344
really beautiful copy every time you see it. 
That's lovely. OK. We talked already about

21:37.349 --> 21:44.117
perceptions of outsiders, of views. One of the 
things that I'm getting from everybody is a little

21:44.485 --> 21:49.555
bit about visions. And because you've been here 
from the very beginning and seen how this has

21:49.636 --> 21:57.291
evolved, the visions for maybe the future of the 
college. And I know right now there's some

21:57.331 --> 22:03.945
tremendous changes and upheavals, and I know or I 
have sense that in this department it would have

22:04.330 --> 22:13.744
much more effect perhaps than in some of the 
departments are probably not going to be affected

22:04.330 --> 22:13.744
because they're just graduate students like Ed 
Addis. How is that affecting the overall climate?

22:21.535 --> 22:24.499
Well, it's unsettling.

22:25.002 --> 22:32.974
And it remains unsettling because the rules seem 
to change every couple weeks. Some kind of message

22:33.315 --> 22:42.869
out of Boston, the dean will meet with a group of 
observers and then they're going to respond. And

22:42.889 --> 22:50.200
we'll get going geared up to respond that way and 
then new news comes out and the first response will

22:42.889 --> 22:50.200
not be adequate. or it's in the wrong direction, or 
we're not sure it will be acceptable, or whatever.

23:02.641 --> 23:17.582
It is unsettling from the standpoint that it's not 
clear to many of us what the target is we're trying

23:02.641 --> 23:17.582
to shoot at.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.085
On the other hand, it's a little bit exciting in 
that it's forcing a reconceived

23:20.622 --> 23:29.192
conceptualization of our whole program. What 
we're doing and how we're doing it is forcing us to

23:30.794 --> 23:43.508
ask ourselves, is the traditional manner in which 
we've attacked the problem the best one, the only

23:30.794 --> 23:43.508
one, the most efficient one?

23:48.483 --> 23:50.426
Might there be a better way of doing it? Might there 
be a way to improve the quality of the people? We

23:56.815 --> 24:01.441
don't have to be argued with very long. But the 
broader the liberal background of the

24:01.461 --> 24:09.873
individual, the better educated he's going to be 
as an individual when he leaves. And that's very

24:10.053 --> 24:11.135
good. An elementary teacher needs to know a lot 
about a lot of things to be a good teacher. Because

24:16.102 --> 24:18.405
an elementary teacher is a lot of things. And 
there's nothing worse than to have somebody who

24:19.027 --> 24:26.256
teaches misinformation to children. So it does 
offer some excitement. I think that we will see

24:30.802 --> 24:37.531
probably some major changes in the next five 
years.

24:40.494 --> 24:46.502
We will probably place more emphasis on graduate 
studies and less on undergraduate studies. And I

24:46.820 --> 24:59.996
predict that there will be a backlash because I 
suspect that we will come up against a severe

24:46.820 --> 24:59.996
teacher shortage as a result of that. Are we 
already facing one? We already are facing one,

25:01.117 --> 25:04.361
yes. And I think that what happened at the 
legislature as a result of the parole commission

25:04.381 --> 25:15.234
and so on was just totally wrong. They missed the 
boat.

25:18.865 --> 25:29.218
On the one hand, they're saying, you've got to 
teach your children, your teacher candidates,

25:18.865 --> 25:29.218
very solid content. They've got to have good 
content. That's first and foremost. They've got

25:33.803 --> 25:36.327
to be broadly educated. Then, they've got to know 
how to teach. But especially beyond that, they've

25:40.392 --> 25:43.135
got to know how to teach reading. They've got to 
know how to diagnose kids who have learning

25:43.942 --> 25:46.906
problems. They've got to be able to handle 
children with special problems and needs. And

25:53.194 --> 25:59.582
they've got to sit on ARD committees and do IEPs and 
so on and so on. They've got to deal with children

25:59.602 --> 26:04.409
with cross-cultural problems and bilingual 
problems. They've got to have developmental

26:05.250 --> 26:07.292
problems. And we're only going to give you 12 hours 
to teach them all that. And it can't be done. They

26:13.489 --> 26:18.095
can't pour on more and more things that you're 
supposed to accomplish and give you less and less

26:13.489 --> 26:18.095
time to do it. So they're working at 
cross-purposes for themselves, and they're

26:20.038 --> 26:29.171
driving the really good people in the profession 
up the wall. Because we know we can't prepare

26:30.753 --> 26:37.542
somebody adequately with 12 hours, six hours of 
student teaching. It just won't work. And as we

26:41.789 --> 26:54.092
view our program, it's not really very overloaded 
right now with methods courses. Probably more

26:54.112 --> 26:57.398
methods courses at the elementary level than the 
secondary level. But at the secondary level, we

26:58.139 --> 27:05.012
could use more methods courses because, for 
instance, take somebody in mathematics. A

27:05.667 --> 27:10.617
secondary teacher in mathematics can teach from 
7th grade through 12th grade. That means

27:10.717 --> 27:14.625
everything from remedial 7th grade math through 
calculus. Now, you cannot teach somebody how to

27:15.647 --> 27:20.938
teach all of that in one semester course. You can't 
do it. You can't do it in two, for that matter. You

27:26.558 --> 27:30.683
can do a whole course on how to teach algebra and a 
whole course on how to teach geometry. And that

27:30.823 --> 27:37.991
still leaves you with the arithmetic and the 
remediation and the higher manner.

27:38.711 --> 27:48.983
So some people just missed the boat on the 
methodology courses. But this is political. It

27:52.266 --> 27:53.127
always has been. I guess it's always going to be. 
It's just too bad we can't. get a voice that keeps

27:56.191 --> 28:05.360
trying to put some sort of rationality back into 
the mix of things. But I foresee that we'll move

28:05.380 --> 28:10.826
over to a five-year kind of program, pretty much. 
And then we'll be forced by circumstances to move

28:12.207 --> 28:19.274
back

28:12.207 --> 28:19.274
to a four-year program. OK. Meanwhile, I think 
we're learning more and more all the time about how

28:20.836 --> 28:25.320
to teach better. I think that the

28:26.178 --> 28:40.651
interest right now in establishing an empirical 
knowledge base, a research base for teacher

28:26.178 --> 28:40.651
education is very healthy. But we don't have a 
research base for more than 20% of what we do. I

28:48.738 --> 28:55.003
wrote a conference last week, or the week before, 
and Walter Doyle from the University of Arizona

28:55.642 --> 29:12.407
about quite clearly that the empirical data that 
we've got is largely based for effective schools,

28:55.642 --> 29:12.407
effective classrooms, on skill subjects and the 
primary grades. You can't generalize that to all

29:14.370 --> 29:24.265
the grades and all the subjects and all the 
advanced levels of understanding. There

29:25.308 --> 29:33.561
are a lot of things like that. So there's ferment to 
get at the investigation of a number of these

29:33.981 --> 29:48.784
things, and I think we'll be steadily asking 
better questions and answering

29:33.981 --> 29:48.784
better questions. Is this a philosophy or a 
thought or a way of thinking that is different or is

29:50.047 --> 30:03.507
specified, or is it just part of its goal and its 
mission, just the same as it is for the college?

30:03.627 --> 30:06.070
Does it have something different? I

30:06.090 --> 30:18.889
kind of think it has a unique...

30:20.168 --> 30:24.054
philosophy, undergraduate level. Well, I don't 
know. At all three levels. I think we have tried

30:27.579 --> 30:30.703
especially hard. And I don't know that we're 
unique in this, but we have tried especially hard

30:32.746 --> 30:43.922
to maintain the Aggie tradition of caring about 
every student, which has been very hard to do. When

30:43.942 --> 30:48.589
I came here in 69, I knew every secondary major by 
name and face. I advised every single one of them

30:49.058 --> 30:53.784
the first year I was here. We now have something 
like 1,400 undergraduate majors. And more than

31:00.733 --> 31:11.968
that, because we've got over 2,000 majors in this 
department, and only about 500 of them, I guess, or

31:00.733 --> 31:11.968
less, are graduate students. So it's very hard to 
be personal with that many people. And that puts a

31:19.197 --> 31:27.707
lot of strain on the people that have that 
philosophy but can only spread themselves so

31:19.197 --> 31:27.707
thin. And we've been wrestling and wrestling and 
wrestling with the question of how to cut the

31:27.727 --> 31:39.020
numbers down so that we can do our job better and 
relate to our students more effectively. But

31:39.040 --> 31:48.090
beyond that, at the graduate level, we carried a 
belief that there ought to be

31:49.927 --> 31:54.733
education beneath specialization. That is, we 
have at both masters and doctoral level some

31:54.833 --> 32:16.137
required core courses that people for each degree 
must take, regardless of whether they're going to

31:54.833 --> 32:16.137
specialize in reading or mathematics education 
or science education or social studies or

31:54.833 --> 32:16.137
whatever.
