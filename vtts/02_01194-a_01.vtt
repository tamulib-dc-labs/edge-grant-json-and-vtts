WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:07.760
It was a late night community meeting last night, 
so I'm dragging just a little bit. My name is Joel

00:10.363 --> 00:17.392
Derichen, and I am Assistant Vice President for 
Community Operations with the Woodlands

00:10.363 --> 00:17.392
Corporation.

00:21.256 --> 00:32.991
My personal background started off in the public 
sector in what used to be called urban renewal and

00:21.256 --> 00:32.991
is now called community development. And I worked 
for the Minneapolis Housing Authority, Housing

00:33.899 --> 00:45.213
Redevelopment Authority, in Minneapolis as a 
planner. Then went on to the New York State Urban

00:45.233 --> 01:02.235
Development Corporation as a project manager, 
and then into a nonprofit corporation called

00:45.233 --> 01:02.235
Detroit Renaissance, whose ambition was to 
redevelop downtown Detroit the Renaissance

01:02.536 --> 01:08.345
Center, which is a large, major urban mixed-use 
project. It was one of the things that we

01:08.365 --> 01:12.973
stimulated to be done when we were there. And then I 
followed my interests into the Newtown movement

01:15.056 --> 01:28.898
of the late 60s and early 70s by joining a company 
called the Newfields Development Corporation.

01:30.346 --> 01:45.425
That was in 1974, which was, and Newfields was a 
4,000-acre new community, HUD new community,

01:30.346 --> 01:45.425
just outside of Dayton, Ohio, in a little town 
called Trotwood, Ohio. Trotwood. Trotwood.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.729
T-R-O-T-W-O-W-D. I had been following new towns 
virtually my entire career when I was with

01:48.950 --> 02:00.184
Minneapolis Housing Redevelopment Authority, 
which was from Oh, let's see. That was about 1960. I

02:05.007 --> 02:12.195
got out of graduate school. Where were you? I was in 
graduate school at the University of Minnesota in

02:13.216 --> 02:17.021
Minneapolis. Were you in architecture or urban? 
Public administration. So it was an MPA you got in?

02:21.767 --> 02:22.668
I got an MPA. And I took a lot of courses in the School 
of Architecture and Planning because I had a real

02:23.068 --> 02:30.357
interest in it. And while I was at the University of 
Minnesota, I did an internship as part of the

02:31.366 --> 02:38.238
public administration program there. I did an 
internship with Minneapolis Housing Authority.

02:43.608 --> 02:51.282
Having grown up in New York and seeing the public 
housing projects that were developed there, I was

02:43.608 --> 02:51.282
always amazed at how rational man could develop 
those things. And I was curious enough that when

02:54.348 --> 03:11.554
offered an internship, I asked them to place me 
with the housing authority so I could see what kind

02:54.348 --> 03:11.554
of idiotic policies might lead to that kind of 
inhumane kind of habitat development. It turned

03:11.575 --> 03:17.924
out the Minneapolis Housing Authority has done 
some of the more outstanding public housing

03:11.575 --> 03:17.924
development in the country. And I was pleased to 
have been able to And then when I graduated, go on to

03:21.265 --> 03:32.499
work there and actually develop some of what has 
been recognized as some of the more outstanding

03:21.265 --> 03:32.499
senior citizen housing in the country. So I never 
did find out why New York City developed the kind of

03:32.559 --> 03:37.225
housing that it did. I think it was more economics 
and pressure for scale than anything else. But at

03:44.154 --> 03:49.180
that time, that was the late 60s, two new towns were 
getting started. One of them was Jonathan,

03:49.598 --> 03:56.869
southwest of Minneapolis in a small town called 
Chaska, Minnesota. And then the first new town in

03:58.311 --> 04:15.876
town under the HUD program called Cedar 
Riverside, which is on the west bank of the

03:58.311 --> 04:15.876
Mississippi River, just adjoining the 
University of Minnesota. While I was living and

04:16.261 --> 04:22.450
working there, going to school there, I was able to 
see what was going on. Was there any involvement by

04:22.470 --> 04:27.137
the faculty in that kind of development that you 
noticed? Well, the principals were actually

04:27.157 --> 04:31.003
professors at the university. They started it. 
And so, yeah, there was a lot of involvement. And

04:38.234 --> 04:43.382
then the New York State Urban Development 
Corporation, which I went to after, of the

04:43.835 --> 04:52.723
Minneapolis Housing Redevelopment Authority, 
was the developer of four, either three or four new

04:43.835 --> 04:52.723
towns.

04:55.926 --> 04:56.507
Actually, three. I think there was one in 
Rochester, two in Rochester. No, I take that back.

05:02.812 --> 05:11.260
One in Rochester, one in Buffalo, New York, and 
then a new town in town in the middle of the East

05:02.812 --> 05:11.260
River called Roosevelt Island. which the first 
two of them never got off the ground to speak of, but

05:12.337 --> 05:21.686
Roosevelt Island or Roosevelt Island did. And it 
is a major in-town development and very

05:21.707 --> 05:27.793
successful today. So I saw those, although I was 
not directly involved in working there. I saw what

05:34.019 --> 05:35.460
was going on. So when I had a chance to become 
involved with a new town, Newfields in Ohio, I

05:41.800 --> 05:54.039
jumped at the opportunity and was involved with 
the planning and initial stages of development.

05:54.881 --> 06:01.211
But moreover, I was brought in to a large extent 
because of my background in the public sector. And

06:01.231 --> 06:09.023
Newfields was in the negotiations with HUD 
regarding the project agreement and the

06:01.231 --> 06:09.023
financing. So for about a year and a half, I spent a 
lot of time in Washington with HUD negotiating the

06:09.982 --> 06:17.633
project agreement. In behalf of Newfields. In 
behalf of Newfields. And we were successful. We

06:24.964 --> 06:30.853
arranged a $14 million commitment for Newfields.

06:33.417 --> 06:38.284
And unfortunately for the project and most of the 
projects and in the Hutt program, they came on

06:38.804 --> 06:48.679
stream just as the economy was nosediving into a 
very deep recession that lasted from 1973 to 1975.

06:49.400 --> 06:55.569
And Newfields— So you were in Washington about 72, 
72? Well, I was in Ohio, but I was traveling to

06:55.589 --> 07:02.380
Washington, going back and forth quite a bit. And 
Newfields opened and closed. opened in, I think it

07:05.720 --> 07:12.529
was the fall of 74, the beginning of 75, and shut 
down in the fall of 75. It was just too severe a

07:12.690 --> 07:21.041
recession for it to withstand. And Newfield, the 
developer at Newfield, did not have the financial

07:22.203 --> 07:32.236
wherewithal to sustain that project. And as we get 
on and talk about the Woodlands, we'll see that's

07:32.257 --> 07:35.541
one of the significant differences between the 
Woodlands and the other projects in the HUD

07:36.432 --> 07:47.805
program, namely stronger financial backing than 
any of the other projects have. Yeah, that's what

07:47.825 --> 07:56.175
they would want to be sure to work on a little bit, is 
that since you've had such a very broad view of the

07:47.825 --> 07:56.175
world, is to prepare that world for this. Yeah. So 
I, continuing with my personal escapades, I left

08:04.495 --> 08:15.572
Newfield in 75, and I did consulting among a number 
of the new communities in the HUD program. They

08:15.592 --> 08:20.759
were all having difficulties because of the time 
and the recession. So I consulted for quite a while

08:21.540 --> 08:33.979
with Park Forest South, which is a HUD Newtowns in 
that community south of Chicago. And then HUD

08:35.933 --> 08:52.032
asked me to come to Washington and consult on 
virtually a full-time basis to help them with what

08:35.933 --> 08:52.032
became workout attempts on about five new 
communities. Shenandoah, south of Atlanta, and

08:53.653 --> 09:01.302
several others, which I did. And I spent about a 
year in Washington doing that. And it was when I was

09:05.667 --> 09:11.876
in Washington that they asked me to do some work on 
the Woodlands. The Woodlands had applied for a

09:12.717 --> 09:17.864
fairly significant grant to develop the Trade 
Center. And so I found myself representing HUD in

09:18.825 --> 09:23.632
those negotiations. Met Rob Lapp, who was vice 
president for governmental affairs, who was

09:23.812 --> 09:33.345
representing the Woodlands Corporation. And

09:35.198 --> 09:44.508
HUD wound up giving the Woodlands a $650,000 grant 
for the Trade Center. And when that was all over and

09:44.528 --> 09:51.275
my work was winding down at HUD, there was an 
opening here in Rob Lapp's department. And he

09:51.295 --> 09:54.558
invited me to come down and visit the Woodlands. 
And I did. And I wound up working for him. That's

09:59.363 --> 10:00.844
when you were on trade? Yeah. I came in. My official 
start date was March 1st of 1977

10:05.084 --> 10:16.620
as Director of Governmental Affairs. And in that 
position, I was responsible for a lot of grant

10:18.663 --> 10:29.218
work, HUD liaison work. local governmental 
relations, working with the county, state

10:30.937 --> 10:39.689
agencies, and regional council of governments. 
By grant work, you mean you wrote proposals? Yeah,

10:42.533 --> 10:45.317
I wrote grant applications. I think personally, 
over the years, I've brought in about $16 or $17

10:45.397 --> 10:57.093
million worth of grant proceeds to this 
corporation. Overall, I think the company has

10:59.573 --> 11:02.957
gotten something in excess of $30 million. And so I 
wrote all the proposals to HUD for community

11:04.459 --> 11:13.350
development block grants. I have gotten grants 
from the state for parks and participated in

11:13.370 --> 11:28.129
writing grant applications to the Department of 
Energy for various demonstration grants. So was

11:29.527 --> 11:33.814
that one of the reasons why LAP was interested in 
you, or do you know? Yeah, I guess. But you never

11:35.497 --> 11:38.822
actually discussed it in that sense. Well, my 
public background was something they were

11:40.445 --> 11:55.770
looking for here, because the Woodlands, being 
such a large project, has to deal with public

11:40.445 --> 11:55.770
agencies all the time. But at that time, We were in a 
virtual partnership with HUD. And the

12:00.955 --> 12:05.381
corporation, I think, wanted to have somebody who 
knew how to deal with it. When I was at the

12:05.421 --> 12:10.228
Minneapolis Housing Authority, I was dealing 
with HUD all the time. Actually, I was dealing with

12:10.248 --> 12:12.210
predecessor agencies. That was even before HUD 
was created. But in the areas of housing, public

12:15.695 --> 12:23.505
housing, low and moderate income housing, they 
needed that here. We, as part of the program, were

12:23.525 --> 12:27.310
required to develop low- and moderate-income 
housing. We're supposed to develop housing that

12:30.398 --> 12:37.365
would represent a cross-section of the Houston 
demography. And one of the criticisms HUD had of

12:38.466 --> 12:44.553
the Woodlands is it wasn't building enough 
affordable housing. It wasn't building any low-

12:44.573 --> 12:47.216
and moderate-income housing. I came out of the 
public sector, a housing background, with the New

12:51.623 --> 12:54.206
York State Urban Development Corporation. I was 
building housing across New York State,

12:54.226 --> 12:58.892
public-type housing. And when I came here, that's 
another thing that I did. We have now...

13:02.256 --> 13:10.786
Well, let me put it this way. When HUD was still 
funding those programs, one out of every five

13:11.387 --> 13:19.977
units that was built in the woodlands was a 
subsidized unit. rent subsidized or mortgage

13:20.193 --> 13:23.358
subsidized. And those were my responsibilities.

13:27.804 --> 13:48.775
So we've developed either directly as the 
developer or through other companies that

13:27.804 --> 13:48.775
specialized in that, I think, well, over 1,000, 
probably closer to 1,200 subsidized units in the

13:27.804 --> 13:48.775
woodlands. And I was responsible for it. for doing 
that. So in some cases, I was the project manager

13:51.507 --> 14:00.078
actually developing those units for the company. 
Or I went out and sought out developers who would

14:00.098 --> 14:07.649
come in and do it because of specialties that they 
had. And also, I brought that kind of expertise

14:08.590 --> 14:19.765
into a subsidiary or an affiliate corporation 
that we have called Mitchell Mortgage Company,

14:08.590 --> 14:19.765
where I set up a commercial division specializing 
in the use of government financing,

14:20.082 --> 14:37.145
tax-exempt bond financing, industrial revenue 
bonds, and government housing programs. Are you

14:37.166 --> 14:41.491
on, let's say, the board of Mitch Morgans now, or 
are you directly involved? No, I'm not. Let me

14:42.253 --> 14:42.953
interrupt you. One of the questions you raised, 
you said HUD's concern was that there was

14:42.973 --> 14:49.903
insufficient or that there was no At that time, no. 
None? None. Now, I've sensed in discussions with

14:53.972 --> 15:06.891
some others that

14:53.972 --> 15:06.891
Mr. Mitchell always planned, however, to have a 
community of broad economic base. Was that

15:06.911 --> 15:19.671
because of the economic situation that that had 
been, I don't want to say neglected, that has all

15:06.911 --> 15:19.671
kinds of values associated with it, but that the 
developers were pushing another segment of the

15:06.911 --> 15:19.671
economy rather than... Or was it because there was 
no funding from HUD? Well, I think it's twofold.

15:27.667 --> 15:33.758
HUD was recalcitrant in funding the programs that 
are promised. And it wasn't until probably 76, or I

15:33.778 --> 15:40.731
think 76 was probably about the year, when they 
actually came through on their promises to make

15:41.420 --> 15:56.819
grants and other assistance available to the 
Newtowns to carry out the social objectives of the

15:41.420 --> 15:56.819
Newtown program. And that only came about because 
there were several developers among the 13

15:57.540 --> 16:10.296
projects that were in the program that finally 
went to Congress and said, we've entered this

15:57.540 --> 16:10.296
program taking on certain obligations that 
developers rarely, if ever, take on, and they're

16:11.204 --> 16:17.675
of a social nature. Economic integration, racial 
integration,

16:19.658 --> 16:34.883
the building in the job base as well as housing, 
those are social objectives, the environment.

16:35.234 --> 16:40.862
developing in a way that's much more costly 
because you're trying to protect the

16:35.234 --> 16:40.862
environment. And HUD had promised the developers 
financial assistance to help carry these out

16:40.882 --> 17:03.016
because you cannot absorb those costs in the 
regular profit picture of a private development.

17:03.036 --> 17:04.498
It just can't be done. And HUD, as I said, reneged on 
that until several of the developers who were...

17:11.385 --> 17:31.050
There was an association of Newtown developers 
that would get together periodically, and

17:11.385 --> 17:31.050
several of them were very good in understanding 
the Washington scene and how to get things done

17:11.385 --> 17:31.050
politically. And they went to Congress and got... 
If we're up to HUD, half of the stuff that we're

17:34.600 --> 17:39.084
doing here in the Woodlands today never would have 
been done. So in summary, this was actually HUD's

17:39.104 --> 17:43.288
failure then, is what you're perceiving. I think 
it was. Now HUD, on the other hand, had a

17:44.869 --> 17:51.235
philosophical difference also with the way the 
Woodlands got started.

17:54.298 --> 18:02.025
HUD would have liked to have seen this project 
start out with only low and moderate income

17:54.298 --> 18:02.025
housing. While HUD agreed contractually that 
there would be the entire spectrum of housing

18:02.917 --> 18:16.030
price in the Woodlands, the staff at HUD never 
really agreed with that. And they considered it an

18:16.050 --> 18:21.215
anathema when they would come down here and see a 
golf course. And they said, why is the federal

18:21.655 --> 18:24.218
government doing that? Well, the Woodlands 
Corporation, being a developer, understood that

18:32.431 --> 18:38.438
if you started out just with the low end of housing, 
you'd never get the cross section. You would

18:39.880 --> 18:44.566
stigmatize the Woodlands as being another HUD 
project. And they wouldn't differentiate it

18:44.586 --> 18:52.956
between a new town and a low income community that 
HUD has sponsored somewhere else. So there was a

18:54.298 --> 19:01.847
strategy of building upper end housing as well as 
middle end and as well as some affordable housing.

19:06.473 --> 19:09.016
Rylan Home was building in here from day one. They 
were building housing that started in the low 20s.

19:12.421 --> 19:17.748
So we were not devoid of the lower end of the 
housing. But HUD was chapped at the fact that we

19:17.768 --> 19:26.259
were building, in those days, what were 
considered to be expensive homes. Well, the fact

19:26.279 --> 19:32.087
is the Woodlands established its reputation in 
the marketplace as being a good quality

19:32.388 --> 19:35.171
community. And because of that, we were able to 
sell $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 houses, as

19:36.272 --> 19:44.960
well as $20,000, $30,000, and $40,000 homes. And 
this is unparalleled in Houston and unparalleled

19:45.060 --> 19:51.786
in the country. That's good. That's a good 
delineation. Now, do you think that character is

19:55.430 --> 19:58.052
still holding in the Woodlands? Absolutely. With 
the balance? Absolutely. It's getting harder to

20:01.615 --> 20:04.839
do because of the absence of grants. We used to get 
grants to do the infrastructure in areas where

20:04.879 --> 20:21.102
we're going to build the low-end product, what we 
call production builders, Ryland. Today it's

20:21.122 --> 20:22.564
Ryland and Pulte. But in those days, Ryland and 
there were some other builders building in that

20:23.305 --> 20:29.994
price range. And what we would do is by virtue of the 
fact that we had grants to build the

20:31.602 --> 20:47.441
infrastructure, we would then stipulate to the 
builder that their price range had to reflect the

20:31.602 --> 20:47.441
fact that we could sell the lots to them cheaper. We 
did not want them to get a windfall profit because

20:47.461 --> 20:56.592
we would, in effect, discount the lots to the 
builder by virtue of the grants that we received.

20:57.493 --> 20:59.095
We had a lower cost basis. We passed that savings on 
to the builder and then stipulated that they had to

20:59.446 --> 21:09.380
keep their sales price within certain ranges, 
which we had agreed with HUD. Did HUD understand

21:09.400 --> 21:10.722
what was happening? Oh, yeah. Sure. This was all. 
Yeah. And that's why they gave us the grants. So

21:15.709 --> 21:23.039
everything we did in that regard had been reviewed 
with HUD and pre-approved by HUD. And our

21:23.760 --> 21:27.445
department... And then when he left the company, I 
took over the department. It was to a large extent,

21:34.346 --> 21:42.216
we were that linkage between the development 
operations and HUD. We were responsible for all

21:42.236 --> 21:53.049
the financial reporting to HUD and all of the 
contract administration and approvals that were

21:42.236 --> 21:53.049
needed. It was a very laborious and tedious 
partnership working with the federal

21:57.243 --> 22:00.368
government. One, I don't recommend to any 
developer because HUD is trying to protect what it

22:00.448 --> 22:13.669
perceives to be the financial or the public 
interest properly. So I don't fall for that. But

22:17.054 --> 22:22.963
the way they go about their business is very slow 
and painstaking. And a developer has to be

22:23.888 --> 22:30.097
responsive to market conditions, which change 
quickly. I mean, we can see today that an incident

22:30.117 --> 22:45.238
in the Middle East can affect the United States 
economy very directly, and real estate is

22:30.117 --> 22:45.238
affected accordingly. So a developer has to be 
able to change gears quickly. HUD is unable. The

22:50.322 --> 22:52.885
federal government is unable to change gears 
quickly. And that was, to a large extent, a very

22:53.506 --> 23:04.698
frustrating relationship.

23:04.719 --> 23:13.048
And each party was probably right from their own 
perspective, but it was a difficult partnership

23:04.719 --> 23:13.048
to carry out. Essentially, the HUD association 
was seized roughly around 82, 84? 83 was when the

23:20.054 --> 23:25.199
final termination agreement was signed. We 
worked on that for about two years. They told us a

23:27.501 --> 23:32.365
couple of years before that that they wanted to get 
out of the business. We were the only project at

23:32.525 --> 23:43.795
that time that was continuing, that was honoring 
the schedule of repayment of the ventures, that

23:32.525 --> 23:43.795
was reporting to HUD. As I said, before I came to the 
Woodlands Corporation, I had gone to HUD as a

23:44.028 --> 23:50.215
consultant on our workout situation. Well, 
mostly what we did was to figure out how HUD could

23:50.795 --> 24:00.446
minimize its losses because there weren't very 
many viable projects. Financially, there were

24:01.027 --> 24:11.318
none except the Woodlands, although a couple of 
the projects did get sold off and are continuing in

24:01.027 --> 24:11.318
some semblance of the Newtown concept even today. 
There are three others besides the Woodlands. And

24:20.291 --> 24:24.555
those are, like, Roosevelt Island? Well, 
Roosevelt Island was under a slightly different

24:24.635 --> 24:28.699
program. They got grants, but they never had a 
debenture guarantee the way the other 13 projects

24:28.719 --> 24:36.166
did.

24:38.127 --> 24:40.950
Maumelle in North Little Rock, Arkansas. is 
continuing, I'm told, substantially in

24:42.044 --> 24:50.655
accordance with the master plan. The St. Charles 
in Charles County, Maryland, which is south of

24:50.675 --> 24:59.846
Washington also, and Harbison in Columbia, South 
Carolina also. Now, they were all financial

25:00.487 --> 25:03.591
failures. And several of them have gone through 
several owners since had foreclosed and sold it

25:03.611 --> 25:11.140
off. the developers have, to a large extent, stuck 
to the idea of a master-planned community. To what

25:21.626 --> 25:24.650
do you attribute the success of the Woodlands? And 
when you arrived here in 1977, 1980, during that

25:24.670 --> 25:41.008
period, how did you compare, in your sense, what 
was going on here as to what you had seen elsewhere

25:24.670 --> 25:41.008
with the new town, new city developments?

25:41.748 --> 25:51.222
Well,

25:41.748 --> 25:51.222
let me compare what I saw here with others. The mix 
of developers in the New Communities Program was

25:51.242 --> 25:59.575
as varied as one could imagine. You had a number of 
developers, like George Mitchell, like Don

26:08.748 --> 26:38.535
Huber, who was the president of Newfield's 
Development Corporation, where I worked, and

26:08.748 --> 26:38.535
several others

26:08.748 --> 26:38.535
who had visions, who had studied new towns in 
Europe, and who really believed what they wanted

26:08.748 --> 26:38.535
to do, albeit within the context of a for-profit 
private development, was to establish

26:39.427 --> 26:47.754
prototypes for better land use planning and land 
development. Bear in mind that we were coming out

26:48.755 --> 26:54.120
of the 60s, which were turbulent times for the 
American city.

26:56.862 --> 26:59.824
The cities were not working for the populace. We 
had also had about 20 years of suburban

27:00.585 --> 27:08.792
development, which had virtually destroyed the 
natural landscape, had not provided the services

27:08.924 --> 27:26.023
that an urbanizing population required, had 
become

27:08.924 --> 27:26.023
bastions of the white middle class, and they were 
not integrated. And there were a number of the

27:27.004 --> 27:37.395
developers who wanted to show that you could 
create cities that would not be

27:39.518 --> 27:46.026
full of the problems, replete with the problems of 
the older cities. So you had George Mitchell,

27:46.486 --> 27:48.629
Huber, and several others. Lester Gross and 
Harbison. OK, so you had your for-profit, the

27:51.172 --> 27:55.096
profit-motivated. Then you had your 
non-profits. You had Harbison, sponsored by the

27:58.100 --> 28:01.484
Presbyterian Church. Lester Gross was their 
president of that corporation. You had Seoul

28:09.033 --> 28:10.855
City.

28:14.340 --> 28:18.445
It was in South Carolina, I believe, or North 
Carolina. Floyd McKissick, one of the civil

28:18.465 --> 28:33.866
rights leaders, wanted to build a community where 
it would be integrated, but nevertheless blacks

28:18.465 --> 28:33.866
would have a home where they were not second-class 
citizens. And it had very much a civil rights bent

28:34.687 --> 28:37.791
to it. You had the New York State Urban Development 
Corporation, a public, well, it was a public

28:39.509 --> 28:58.581
purpose corporation, it was a quasi-public 
corporation, building three new towns with

28:39.509 --> 28:58.581
motives that, again, were altruistic as were 
ours, trying to demonstrate that America can do

28:58.949 --> 29:14.347
better, can create an urban environment that 
serves the people and serves them well. And then,

29:14.367 --> 29:27.302
frankly, I saw some developers who saw the HUD 
guarantee as a way of raising capital to do their

29:27.535 --> 29:41.072
projects without as much of a vision of urbanism as 
George Mitchell has and had then and a number of the

29:27.535 --> 29:41.072
others. So it ranged over the landscape. I would 
say most of the developers, though,

29:44.997 --> 29:56.412
were forward-thinking people who wanted to 
create a better environment and so forth. In fact,

29:56.830 --> 30:05.461
the new housing legislation was sponsored by a 
congressman from Ohio by the name of Thomas

29:56.830 --> 30:05.461
Ashley. And he really, in the course of his career 
in Congress, was responsible for a good measure of

30:06.382 --> 30:19.458
the urban legislation, the community 
development legislation, the housing

30:06.382 --> 30:19.458
legislation. And gentlemen like Don Huben from 
Newfields and George Mitchell and others worked

30:27.273 --> 30:28.554
very closely with him. The new community 
legislation is more a product of the private

30:28.815 --> 30:38.004
sector than it was a product of the public sector. 
HUD came along once the initiative was in motion.

30:43.990 --> 30:54.180
But I give credit to forward-thinking developers 
like Mr. Mitchell to get the law in motion. And

30:54.901 --> 30:57.043
they, to a large extent, shaped Now,

30:57.243 --> 31:04.874
when you arrived here, what was your impression of 
what was going on? Did it jar you? Did it seem to fit

31:07.016 --> 31:12.845
your sensibilities,

31:07.016 --> 31:12.845
maybe? Well,

31:13.545 --> 31:25.562
just a little personal side note, when Lapp 
invited me to come down and visit and talk about

31:27.601 --> 31:30.245
coming to work here. I was born and raised in 
Brooklyn, New York, and lived in the North my

31:30.265 --> 31:35.513
entire life. And while I was interested in seeing 
the Woodlands firsthand, I wasn't that

31:36.274 --> 31:47.271
interested in moving to Texas. And he did a very 
clever thing. He said, bring your wife down with

31:50.556 --> 31:53.440
you. Because he knew that the Woodlands was an 
attractive community, and it was. After one

31:58.796 --> 32:12.636
weekend here, I was sold on the Woodlands as a place 
to raise a family, and sold on the Woodlands as a

31:58.796 --> 32:12.636
place to establish a career. Which is still the 
prime motive of the Woodlands. Sure. Oh, yes. I

32:18.765 --> 32:22.330
bought the dream hook, line, and sinker. We had a 
little girl four and a half years old, and we had

32:22.799 --> 32:27.085
another one. My wife was pregnant. She was to give 
birth within three or four months. And the

32:34.695 --> 32:41.724
environment here was just so conducive to raising 
a family that I did accept the position.

32:45.309 --> 32:50.916
What I didn't know was how much in its infancy, or 
what I didn't realize, the Woodlands really was.

32:51.689 --> 32:59.856
It had opened in the fall of 1974, but had some slow 
going because of the recession, which we spoke

32:51.689 --> 32:59.856
about earlier. It was 1974 until about late 1976, 
so for about a two-year period it was slow going. It

33:04.960 --> 33:06.262
was just starting to crank up. I guess I didn't 
fully appreciate the risk that I was taking,

33:08.443 --> 33:20.734
making the move, because the woodlands had not 
really fully established itself or gotten its

33:08.443 --> 33:20.734
foothold. But fortunately, the economy turned 
around. Houston

33:24.252 --> 33:29.921
began its ascent in 1977. If you look at the graph, 
77 was the year it really took off. And it turned out

33:34.287 --> 33:37.932
not to be that much of a risk. We still hold the 
values, the objectives that are embodied in the

33:46.870 --> 33:52.257
HUD program, which are manifested in the project 
agreement. There's a section there called the

33:52.357 --> 33:54.760
development plan. It's Exhibit G to the project 
agreement. I can get you a copy if you'd like. And we

34:02.870 --> 34:07.776
still hold to those ideals. My department still 
pursues low and moderate income housing. We still

34:15.592 --> 34:25.967
may have a very active affirmative action program 
to attract minorities to the woodlands. We

34:27.269 --> 34:32.737
develop the project to be environmentally 
sensitive. Our master plan calls for the

34:33.679 --> 34:43.573
introduction of all of the services that a 
community requires, be they public or private.

34:44.448 --> 34:53.879
We've worked closely with the social service 
agencies of Montgomery County to make sure that

34:44.448 --> 34:53.879
our population is well served. And those are the 
things that I do. I'm kind of the solver. But those

34:56.843 --> 35:03.871
all were pre-existing to the Woodlands' 
involvement in HUD, were they not? The goals?

35:05.573 --> 35:05.754
Yeah. Oh, yeah, Mr. Mitchell. I mean, that was part 
of his dream from the outset. Certainly.

35:14.104 --> 35:14.204
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, HUD, that's a good point. 
I mean, we'd be doing these things whether HUD was

35:17.667 --> 35:22.211
involved or not. The only point I was making is that 
we became contractually bound to do them when HUD

35:23.432 --> 35:29.598
was involved. We are no longer contractually 
bound, and we continue to do it. Yeah, there's a

35:34.222 --> 35:36.624
continuity there. Yeah, sure. And I think that's 
what makes the Woodlands as successful as it is. at

35:43.814 --> 35:51.104
least last quarter anyway, where number one in 
housing starts in the Houston area, people are

35:43.814 --> 35:51.104
attracted to it. And they come to the Woodlands, 
and once they're here a while, they develop almost

35:53.087 --> 35:59.716
a religious fervor for the Woodlands. Dare we 
not... put a sign in that's tasteful or take down

36:04.081 --> 36:10.009
one tree too many, we're quick to hear about it. And 
that's good. It's good that the people adopt the

36:11.171 --> 36:19.924
ideals the way we have and keep our toes to the fire. 
Let me ask you another question about that. And

36:23.208 --> 36:28.115
this may seem somewhat out of left field. One of the 
things that's really evident, as we've talked to

36:28.856 --> 36:32.822
individuals, is that like yourself many of the 
people involved in the woodlands corporation

36:33.427 --> 36:56.329
share have the same vision they share that vision 
and they had it off times before they came and

36:33.427 --> 36:56.329
working at the woodlands has reinforced it and 
strengthened it

36:33.427 --> 36:56.329
men officially those who who move here and make 
their homes here also share that vision is that a

36:33.427 --> 36:56.329
universal vision do you think among residents no 
it's obviously among residents it is why else

36:58.503 --> 37:26.113
would they be here but i meant i meant among you know 
humankind we've heard that from one individual

36:58.503 --> 37:26.113
and i wondered if you shared that notion i think 
that uh as opposed to being you know to operating

36:58.503 --> 37:26.113
upon a certain segment that maybe loves trees or 
you know see there's people living out in arizona

36:58.503 --> 37:26.113
obviously they don't know trees see i'm trying to 
say well The aesthetic of the woodlands

37:28.574 --> 37:35.421
is attractive to some people and is not to others. 
I've heard people say, I'd get claustrophobic

37:36.782 --> 37:40.946
living with all these trees here. You can't see 
more than 20 feet in front of you. There are people

37:44.090 --> 37:48.294
who like the open views. I

37:48.534 --> 37:57.383
think,

37:48.534 --> 37:57.383
given a choice, people will choose a better 
planned residential setting in which to live. But

38:06.929 --> 38:09.533
choice has a multitude of factors. Distance to and 
from work. The Woodlands is reasonably far out

38:14.121 --> 38:18.648
from a lot of employment centers. Mobility is 
improving and we're finding that we're

38:18.668 --> 38:24.518
attracting people who otherwise maybe five years 
ago before the Hardy toll road was opened, before

38:24.633 --> 38:31.521
we had the bus service, wouldn't have moved here. 
But proximity to work, cost, notwithstanding the

38:31.541 --> 38:49.102
fact that we have housing of all price ranges, 
there still are some built-in costs to live here

38:31.541 --> 38:49.102
because the service package, for example, 
doesn't come free. So there's a community

38:49.583 --> 38:53.307
association assessment is at Lauren Basin. At the 
upper end, it becomes more expensive than in your

38:55.490 --> 39:03.581
typical subdivision. We have a building code 
here, which means that builders have to build to a

39:04.583 --> 39:17.701
higher level of standard than they would 
otherwise be required if they went outside of

39:04.583 --> 39:17.701
Woodlands at 1960 or something like that. So 
people are getting better built homes But per

39:21.097 --> 39:23.822
square foot, they cost a little bit more. So cost is 
a factor. People like to be near their family and

39:26.907 --> 39:30.313
friends. And if you grew up in southwest Houston, 
you're probably not going to move to the

39:30.334 --> 39:36.064
woodlands. So there are a lot of factors which 
enter in people's decisions as to whether to move

39:36.084 --> 39:39.690
or not. I would say it's probably a universal ideal 
that all things being equal, being close to work,

39:45.953 --> 39:49.660
being close to family, being close to churches. If 
you grew up in a certain church and your roots are

39:50.882 --> 39:59.558
there, you may choose to live around there. And I 
think that's one reason why we do so much better in

40:01.647 --> 40:08.436
selling to people who are moving into Houston from 
outside. Two-thirds of the people who move into

40:08.936 --> 40:13.903
the limits year in and year out are moving from 
outside the Houston area. That's one of the things

40:14.003 --> 40:15.965
I wondered about. One-third of the people come 
from Houston, one-third come from elsewhere in

40:16.106 --> 40:24.376
Texas, and one-third come from out of state or out 
of country. And that's been consistent since we

40:24.396 --> 40:28.802
opened the windows. People are rooted and aren't 
too likely to move very far. Believe it or not, you

40:36.609 --> 40:46.077
know, from what people tell me, moving from 
southwest Houston to north Houston is considered

40:36.609 --> 40:46.077
to be a major move. I've moved around a lot in my 
life, so it doesn't seem to be that much. But more

40:51.221 --> 40:59.008
developers are doing master plan communities 
around the country, and they're attracting

40:51.221 --> 40:59.008
larger shares in the market. So I think, again, all 
things being equal and an inclination to move or

41:00.744 --> 41:14.519
having to move, people seek out the better 
developed, better planned communities. Would

41:14.539 --> 41:22.448
you talk a little while about the, if this is an 
appropriate time, about the relations between

41:14.539 --> 41:22.448
the Woodlands Corporation In fact, the 
conceptual design for transferring control and

41:23.120 --> 41:41.610
authority to the community association, how all 
this came to be, and what sort of progress is being

41:23.120 --> 41:41.610
made, and what sort of problems are occurring that 
many were anticipating? That process of

41:41.630 --> 41:49.903
transferring control to the community in the 
community management business is called

41:41.630 --> 41:49.903
transition.

41:52.195 --> 41:59.144
Transition typically takes place... Is this 
something you learned about in school? I didn't

41:59.184 --> 42:01.687
learn about transition in school. I suspect they 
weren't even dealing with it. They weren't

42:04.491 --> 42:05.272
dealing with it.

42:09.016 --> 42:19.990
Community associations as a

42:09.016 --> 42:19.990
reasonably widespread phenomenon is only about 
18 years old. 17, 18 years old. They really started

42:23.245 --> 42:26.969
coming into play around 1973. And in 1973, there 
were only about 500 community associations

42:28.690 --> 42:36.417
around the country. And now there are hundreds of 
thousands, tens of thousands. I mean, we've got,

42:41.702 --> 42:46.767
we estimate, 4,000 to 5,000 community 
associations in the Houston area alone. And there

42:48.188 --> 42:53.033
has developed a profession of community 
management in a national organization called the

42:53.840 --> 43:01.710
Community Associations Institute, which trains 
people to be community managers.

43:04.273 --> 43:14.306
And I'm personally very active

43:04.273 --> 43:14.306
in that, and it's been a good experience. 
Transition is the process of turning a community

43:14.326 --> 43:22.497
association control from the developer to to the 
residents of the community. It happens in condo

43:26.860 --> 43:32.708
associations, townhouse associations, and 
homeowners associations. It typically takes

43:33.329 --> 43:42.721
place when the development is about 85% 
completed.

43:43.482 --> 43:51.433
And this was a convention which has been 
institutionalized by Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae

43:43.482 --> 43:51.433
and HUD and so forth. So a developer has to do it. The 
rationale there is during the actual phases of

43:53.054 --> 44:01.464
development, the developer needs control of his 
project. He needs to be able to make business

44:01.484 --> 44:12.096
decisions about what's going to be developed, 
when it's going to be developed, how it's going to

44:01.484 --> 44:12.096
be developed, design decisions, and so forth. And 
a community association is considered to be an

44:13.458 --> 44:19.225
important part of development. It's very 
important to the marketing of the project. more so

44:23.058 --> 44:26.101
on the larger projects, less so on the smaller 
projects. But nevertheless, setting it up so that

44:26.121 --> 44:36.951
it's economically viable and all of the covenants 
and the bylaws and all of that are done properly.

44:37.072 --> 44:39.114
And that's the reason it's left in the developer's 
hands.

44:41.876 --> 44:48.863
But come 85% of completion,

44:41.876 --> 44:48.863
the developer turns it over to the residents. The 
authorities, like Fannie Mae and Judy Mayfield,

44:52.089 --> 45:02.602
that the developers' interests have been 
substantially protected, and it's time to turn it

44:52.089 --> 45:02.602
over. And in those situations, generally what 
they're doing is turning over the assets of the

45:02.622 --> 45:18.462
association, the common property, the open 
space, common areas, swimming pools, tennis

45:02.622 --> 45:18.462
courts, things like that. They also turn over the 
books and records of the association and any funds

45:20.315 --> 45:32.334
that the association has, bank accounts, which 
the developers hold. When the Woodlands was

45:32.354 --> 45:36.521
conceived, it was conceived to be a 20-year 
development. And in the covenants, there is

45:38.965 --> 45:45.175
provision for the gradual increase of resident 
representatives on the Woodlands Community

45:45.745 --> 45:51.272
Association Board of Directors. So as a number of 
occupied households would increase, they would

45:51.292 --> 45:56.940
get more representation. But through the 20-year 
period, which represented, when you look at the

45:57.461 --> 46:12.040
projections, about 85% completion of the 
Woodlands, the developer would have a majority on

45:57.461 --> 46:12.040
the board of the WCA. A mistake was made in the 
drafting of the covenants. And that was they put in

46:17.104 --> 46:29.258
a date certain when control of the board would 
transfer or transition from the developer to the

46:17.104 --> 46:29.258
community. And they put in a 1992 date. Why 20 
years? Well, when you look back at it, every one of

46:34.585 --> 46:38.449
the HUD projects was a 20-year project. whether it 
was Soul City in South Carolina, or whether it was

46:38.767 --> 46:52.728
the Woodlands in Boomtown, Houston, or whether it 
was Gananda in suburban Rochester, New York. And

46:52.748 --> 46:55.792
that had to do with the length of the adventures. It 
had less to do with the market that each one was

46:55.812 --> 47:00.259
operating in. And as I look back on it, it seems 
fairly obvious that the 20-year was a force fit to

47:07.471 --> 47:10.815
coincide with what hud had just decided
