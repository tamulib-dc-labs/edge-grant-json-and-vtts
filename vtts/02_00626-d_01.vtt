00:05.043 --> 00:19.260
It's been suggested that during this period, 
while you were at the Hydrographic Office, that

00:05.043 --> 00:19.260
research and development oceanography was 
directed by or divided up, if I may use that word,

00:05.043 --> 00:19.260
between Ewing, Islin, and Revell. That they sort 
of are working on plotting, as it were, of

00:20.321 --> 00:25.507
expanding oceanography. Would you agree with

00:25.527 --> 00:31.715
that? You're talking... I'm talking about 46, 47, 
and 48, when Scripps and Woods Hole and O&R began to

00:35.722 --> 00:46.954
think about what the future of oceanography is. 
Yes, I think that's probably a pretty fair

00:48.596 --> 00:55.063
statement. They certainly exerted a lot of 
influence in the Washington area.

01:05.337 --> 01:22.298
And

01:05.337 --> 01:22.298
I think it's hard in a way

01:05.337 --> 01:22.298
for me to recall too much what was happening at the 
institutions at that time, because I wasn't

01:05.337 --> 01:22.298
there. I wasn't in any of them. I was in Washington. 
And I think it was really to kind of stabilize after

01:25.756 --> 01:38.712
the war and get things on what we looked at as more or 
less stable footing. There was, if I can go off on a

01:39.573 --> 01:48.203
tangent here for a moment, I showed you this 
morning this book by Vaughan, which I have called

01:48.875 --> 02:17.616
NASCO I. NASCO is a term that came in later, but this 
was one of the early attempts of the National

01:48.875 --> 02:17.616
Academy of Sciences to look at the state of marine 
sciences in this country, which occurred in the

01:48.875 --> 02:17.616
1920s. although that book of wants was not 
published until essentially ten years later. But

02:22.694 --> 02:34.474
there was another National Academy committee set 
up at about the time you're talking about, and I

02:22.694 --> 02:34.474
can't remember it exactly, at which Scripps, 
Woods Hole, and so on, were asked essentially what

02:35.180 --> 02:40.866
they thought they wanted to do. And I can't recall 
any of the content, but there is a small

02:40.966 --> 02:47.934
publication resulting from that committee. And 
the only part of it I can recall at all was that

02:49.076 --> 03:04.613
Professor Thompson, who was then director of what 
were known as the Oceanographic Laboratories at

02:49.076 --> 03:04.613
the University of Washington, his chief emphasis 
that he just wanted to return to the pre-war

03:05.167 --> 03:14.235
status, which I thought was singularly 
unimaginative, as I remember. But yes, I think

03:14.876 --> 03:23.023
that

03:14.876 --> 03:23.023
it was pretty much dominated by Woods Hole 
scripts. And then Lamont came on the scene, I

03:23.043 --> 03:26.707
guess, about that time. And then there was this 
flurry of establishment of essentially new

03:27.327 --> 03:34.954
laboratories. Chesapeake Bay Institute, Texas 
A&M in particular come to mind here, and there were

03:35.339 --> 03:44.592
several others, as I recall. What sort of fellow 
was Islin? What was he like? Well, I think I,

03:49.939 --> 04:03.979
although I was never sort of spent very much time at 
Woods Hole and so on, apparently I knew more about

04:04.398 --> 04:21.700
him and a lot of his people that more or less lived 
with him, in that he was very much sort of a lone wolf

04:04.398 --> 04:21.700
in a way, although he was quite outgoing in 
meetings and conferences and so on. His private

04:21.760 --> 04:32.093
life was something which was very much his own, and 
he lived on Martha's Vineyard and later on near

04:32.258 --> 04:34.622
Boston, I think it was in Newton. I'm one of the few 
people who's ever been a house guest at the S-Lens

04:36.204 --> 04:42.974
as far as I know, and I don't know quite why. But

04:43.014 --> 04:55.313
he was a real sort of a puzzle to me in a way because he 
was

04:57.689 --> 05:04.857
very imaginative in many ways, and very 
farsighted in looking ahead and so on. In fact, I

05:05.678 --> 05:22.377
was just thinking the other day that some of the 
things he said to me at the time I thought were

05:05.678 --> 05:22.377
silly, and which I now look back on and see that he 
was just about 10 or 20 years ahead of anybody else

05:05.678 --> 05:22.377
and things. However, I always felt that he was in a 
sense, anti-intellectual, which sounds kind of

05:28.013 --> 05:44.188
snobbish here, but his own background was only, I 
think, up to the level of a bachelor's degree, and

05:28.013 --> 05:44.188
his degree, I think, was actually in 
anthropology. In other words, he didn't have a

05:44.248 --> 05:56.400
very strong sort of scientific background on 
which to build, and he tended to look for similar

05:57.038 --> 06:11.282
types of people in many cases who were interested, 
but I would consider in a sense not scientifically

05:57.038 --> 06:11.282
qualified. Now, he made me a liar in a number of 
cases here, in that some of these people that he had

06:22.520 --> 06:33.536
joined Woods Hole, an organization that turned 
out to be very outstanding, but I would venture

06:22.520 --> 06:33.536
that the sort of general average was not too good. 
And one of the great deficiencies I felt at Woods

06:34.177 --> 06:49.320
Hole was that they never sincerely sought, I'm 
talking of the era when Islin was there, but it

06:34.177 --> 06:49.320
tended to carry on after he'd retired. was they 
never really supported an educational program

06:49.739 --> 06:56.446
either at Woods Hole or anywhere else. They were 
very, very much out of research oriented here. And

07:01.252 --> 07:13.165
it was only when I think

07:01.252 --> 07:13.165
it was Admiral Smith in particular later on saw 
certain advantages which could be achieved in

07:13.533 --> 07:19.438
terms of money by becoming an educational 
institution. They sort of switched in that

07:19.498 --> 07:21.340
direction. But I don't think they've ever really 
taken it very seriously. That's my sort of point

07:24.263 --> 07:28.387
here. And

07:28.407 --> 07:40.738
so I asked

07:28.407 --> 07:40.738
Columbus one day. how do you recruit your people? 
And he said, oh, I don't worry about that. I have

07:45.213 --> 07:48.557
enough nice young men come knocking on my door. I 
never have to go looking for people. And I think

07:52.823 --> 07:56.507
this was true in many cases. They were nice young 
men, in the best sense of the word. What about

08:02.255 --> 08:02.976
Ewing? Oh, Ewing is an entrepreneur, obviously, 
and very aggressive, very different, entirely

08:03.897 --> 08:11.046
different. It was very

08:11.549 --> 08:39.767
tremendously hardworking and

08:11.549 --> 08:39.767
broadly interested and

08:11.549 --> 08:39.767
very much the entrepreneur, as I said, capable of 
interesting people, raising money, getting

08:11.549 --> 08:39.767
things going, and so on. I think with a good eye in 
most cases for people that he hired to work with

08:40.608 --> 09:04.665
him, the main

08:40.608 --> 09:04.665
sort of reservation I have about Ewing as I used to 
identify him, he was a cream skimmer. He'd get an

09:05.045 --> 09:09.552
idea, do enough work on it to sort of meet his 
particular interest at the moment, sometimes

09:09.768 --> 09:33.306
correctly, sometimes I think misinterpreting 
things, and then he'd move on to something else and

09:09.768 --> 09:33.306
leave it to other people to kind of come along and 
clean up sometimes the mess I think he left behind

09:09.768 --> 09:33.306
him in the sense. But I think we can, in a field such 
as this, we can always and should consider

09:37.612 --> 09:41.979
ourselves fortunate to have some people like 
that. We don't want everybody to be Morris Ewing.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.387
That same charge has been leveled against 
Revelle. Would you agree with that? Well, Revelle

09:49.250 --> 10:05.155
has switched around a great deal, and

09:49.250 --> 10:05.155
yet I think Again, it's hard to make offhand kind of 
judgments and evaluations, but his interests

10:06.805 --> 10:22.023
were clearly much broader than Ewing's. And I 
think it's fair to say that Ravel had, in a sense, an

10:23.344 --> 10:34.958
altruistic interest in many of these things, 
although they redounded to his glory in a way. But I

10:35.018 --> 10:36.019
think Ewing's concerns were always, as things 
affected Ewing. And I can't imagine Ewing getting

10:43.709 --> 10:50.259
involved in these programs in India and so on. 
Pakistan has rebelled it, or Ewing going

10:50.279 --> 11:03.360
to Harvard has rebelled it and entering an 
entirely new sort of field here. And so there's

11:03.380 --> 11:04.842
really very major differences i think between 
them now we know it's almost as if in you know let's

11:05.497 --> 11:34.002
say about 48 or 49 right before you decide to come to 
washington it's almost as if the onr says uh look we

11:05.497 --> 11:34.002
there's not enough oceanographers to suit the 
needs and what we've got to do is move out and not

11:05.497 --> 11:34.002
only establish departments of oceanography but 
establish particularly kinds of departments of

11:05.497 --> 11:34.002
oceanography uh We need, for example, chemical 
oceanographers, and where should that be, and

11:35.078 --> 11:40.586
what should it be? We need people to work on the Gulf 
Coast, and what should they do, and what should

11:40.606 --> 11:44.111
they be? Would you agree with that? Yes, I think 
my... I haven't thought about these things for so

11:48.938 --> 12:03.398
long, and dates and events and so on are getting 
confused, but there was the...

12:04.441 --> 12:13.634
this sort of regionalism, yes, that we ought to 
spot places in appropriate coastal regions. And

12:13.754 --> 12:19.402
there was nothing in the Gulf of Mexico and so on. 
And then this Chesapeake Bay development came up,

12:20.323 --> 12:30.297
which was really, I think, possibly brought into 
being as much as anything else, but the fact that

12:31.424 --> 12:47.064
ONR was willing to put some money into it, although 
it was, as I recall, sort of a tripartite

12:31.424 --> 12:47.064
arrangement at first of Maryland, Virginia, and 
ONR. And that was thought of as a center for sort of

12:48.225 --> 12:55.394
looking at large bays and estuaries. And so it was 
partly regional, partly sort of subject matter. I

13:01.478 --> 13:23.787
don't really recall any

13:01.478 --> 13:23.787
strong impetus really towards sort of training 
programs, although they obviously came along

13:01.478 --> 13:23.787
with this in a way. ONR is always in the rather 
difficult position that they were not supposed to

13:27.601 --> 13:44.218
support education as such, and so it was often 
done, but it was budgeted for in essentially other

13:27.601 --> 13:44.218
terms here.

13:45.859 --> 13:55.549
They certainly wanted to help here, and

13:45.859 --> 13:55.549
the

13:57.537 --> 14:17.614
Dr. Thompson was the director of what were then 
known as the Oceanographic Laboratories, which

13:57.537 --> 14:17.614
had existed since about 1930 when the Rockefeller 
money was available and the laboratories were set

13:57.537 --> 14:17.614
up. And there was some teaching prior to the war, 
some local sort of work at sea with a very small

14:18.235 --> 14:27.443
vessel which was actually sold by the university 
during the war, so there was no vessel left here.

14:35.724 --> 14:51.239
When Dr. Thompson came back to the university 
after the war, he had a commission in the chemical

14:35.724 --> 14:51.239
warfare branch of the Army. He tried to pick up the 
pieces and sort of reestablish a program here and

14:58.102 --> 15:04.049
found it very difficult because a lot of the people 
had moved away or died or got other interests.

15:04.089 --> 15:05.911
There was no vessel here and so on. So he was really 
faced with a real problem. And the first thing that

15:13.899 --> 15:27.214
essentially the ONR did here was provide a little 
money to essentially get a small vessel going

15:13.899 --> 15:27.214
again and to support a few people.

15:28.898 --> 15:37.789
you know, as I indicated a while ago, kind of get it 
going a little bit as it had been 10 years

15:28.898 --> 15:37.789
previously. And so when I came out here, ONR 
support was about $100,000 a year, and that was

15:37.809 --> 15:52.948
essentially the only support available. it was 
available on a, it was really a kind of block

15:53.485 --> 16:02.714
funding, and it was out of this we began to develop 
the programs here. So, yes, I think it was a

16:03.434 --> 16:08.559
deliberate effort of O.N.R. to try and 
proliferate,

16:08.579 --> 16:20.050
but I think in many cases, if the

16:20.755 --> 16:42.259
availability of funds for some of these newer 
institutions and trying to get the University of

16:20.755 --> 16:42.259
Washington back in business again was 
essentially as long as it didn't interfere too

16:20.755 --> 16:42.259
much with the funding of Scripps and Woods Hole, 
which may sound like sour grapes, but I think that

16:20.755 --> 16:42.259
in a way this was a sub-situation. Who made contact 
with you to come out here? I don't know exactly what

16:46.237 --> 17:03.282
happened, but the man on the faculty or in the 
administration here who contacted me was the dean

16:46.237 --> 17:03.282
of the College of Arts and Sciences, Dean Lloyd 
Woodburn. And

17:03.302 --> 17:14.758
I don't know whether I'd been suggested by Tommy 
Thompson or just have,

17:15.768 --> 17:31.931
They had realized, and I think this is sort of worth 
noting, that they couldn't go back to the kind of

17:15.768 --> 17:31.931
pre-war operations, that something had to be done 
here that would change the thing. And in the spring

17:32.231 --> 17:45.690
of 1951, the

17:32.231 --> 17:45.690
Board of Regents, which is our governing body, 
decided I'm sure it was on the recommendation of

17:46.008 --> 18:10.564
Dean Woodburn to create a department of 
oceanography in the College of Arts and Sciences,

17:46.008 --> 18:10.564
which then just changed the emphasis away from a 
sort of a research activity towards an

17:46.008 --> 18:10.564
educational activity and made it entirely 
appropriate to go into sort of undergraduate as

17:46.008 --> 18:10.564
well as graduate education. There were two sort of 
separate entities here at the university, which

18:13.261 --> 18:26.734
had been operated before the war and had returned 
to this sort of situation after the war.

18:30.497 --> 18:38.264
Both of them operated under this general title of 
the Oceanographic Laboratories, plural. And one

18:39.265 --> 18:42.188
was a facility at the Friday Harbor on the San Juan 
Islands, which is a field station type thing, and

18:43.265 --> 19:01.986
the building that had been erected on the main 
campus here, which, with Rockville money, which

18:43.265 --> 19:01.986
you have to go and have a look at while you're here, 
it's hidden by the other edifice here now. These

19:02.567 --> 19:11.517
two things were operated jointly under Professor 
Thompson, and when I came out here, the assumption

19:02.567 --> 19:11.517
was that I would operate both of them. But for a 
variety of reasons, it seemed much better to me to

19:14.196 --> 19:21.843
operate them separately. But I was not only—I was 
called executive officer of the Department of

19:21.923 --> 19:32.935
Oceanography and director of the Freddie Harbor 
Laboratories. And I had these two jobs, in effect,

19:32.975 --> 19:40.963
for some seven years, I think it was. And then 
someone else took over as director at the Freddie

19:41.467 --> 19:46.733
Harbor Laboratories. But I had dual jobs here. As I 
mentioned earlier, I got into administration of

19:52.781 --> 20:02.552
one kind during the war, administration of 
another kind in Washington. I came out here and I

20:02.632 --> 20:07.238
got into still another kind of administration. So 
in many respects, I haven't been a research

20:08.129 --> 20:13.376
scientist for a long, long time here. And it was 
more by accident than I think by choice. When you

20:20.687 --> 20:24.452
came to the west to visit the dean, what did he tell 
you? What about the Department of Oceanography he

20:24.572 --> 20:27.997
wanted you to find? Oh, I think that

20:28.017 --> 20:37.410
I had fairly fairly

20:38.909 --> 20:46.520
strong ideas at that time about what I thought I 
wanted to do. And part of it had come out of some

20:47.341 --> 21:06.908
deliberations that had gone on, and I can't really 
remember at the moment who prompted them, whether

20:47.341 --> 21:06.908
it was ONR or some other agency. We'd had a number of 
meetings on essentially education in

21:07.208 --> 21:29.688
oceanography, and there was a paper that was 
finally published, and I think it was in Science,

21:07.208 --> 21:29.688
if I remember correctly, by Redfield and I think 
Revell and several others, sort of setting out

21:07.208 --> 21:29.688
what they felt the curriculum in oceanography 
ought to be. And this was part of what I sort of had in

21:30.689 --> 21:35.573
mind when I came out here. In other words, I wasn't 
operating entirely on my own hunches here. There

21:41.660 --> 21:46.947
was some agreement, in a sense, as to what might be 
done. Now, what was different here was the

21:47.027 --> 21:54.858
opportunity to get into the undergraduate 
program.

21:56.661 --> 22:05.093
It took us about a year, I think, to develop

22:05.393 --> 22:13.266
sort of program courses and so forth that we 
thought we could start with. And

22:13.506 --> 22:23.743
we had our first students, I guess, in about 1952. 
Now, this

22:23.763 --> 22:32.397
is, in effect, now the first institution of 
undergraduate oceanography in the country and

22:23.763 --> 22:32.397
possibly in the world. So, what sort of students 
did you look for?

22:39.812 --> 22:47.661
Well, I don't know whether we looked for a 
particular kind of students, because students

22:39.812 --> 22:47.661
kind of come to you in a case like this. What we felt, 
and I think correctly, was that we were offering

22:50.084 --> 23:01.337
them a sort of an interesting field. But more 
particularly, an opportunity for students. It

23:06.787 --> 23:15.079
obviously is science oriented, and in a sense 
here, basically science oriented, a basic

23:06.787 --> 23:15.079
science orientation. A

23:17.002 --> 23:28.118
field where the student could be a kind of a 
scientific generalist rather than a specialist.

23:28.773 --> 23:37.737
And I've always felt that way and I feel it even more 
so today that I'm not saying it's the kind of

23:28.773 --> 23:37.737
program that should be available for for 
everybody, or it really shouldn't displace the

23:38.543 --> 23:45.210
kind of specialist programs. But I think there 
should be opportunities at all levels for

23:45.270 --> 23:57.343
students who have an inclination towards being 
broad and being generalists,

23:45.270 --> 23:57.343
interdisciplinary, and these various other 
terms that are used. There should be some

23:57.363 --> 23:59.185
opportunities for that. And this is essentially 
what we started out with this in mind. sort of

24:07.720 --> 24:24.076
things we had in mind was to prepare people really 
for jobs in agencies such as hydrographic office

24:07.720 --> 24:24.076
and other government and state agencies who 
needed people. The other institutions at that

24:25.298 --> 24:33.846
time were all postgraduate, and really all they 
were interested in were doctoral people, so they

24:25.298 --> 24:33.846
were They were training all the generals, but they 
didn't have any Indians to go along with them. And I

24:41.380 --> 24:49.976
felt that not very glamorous, but certainly a need 
that I thought we could meet. And I think we did

24:50.877 --> 24:54.163
fairly well. The original sort of concept was that 
all the students would go through a similar sort of

24:55.156 --> 25:07.795
curriculum, but this only lasted for a relatively 
few years. And then we began increasing in

25:07.995 --> 25:16.588
numbers, and the research program increased, and 
there were more faculty and so forth. And I found I

25:16.608 --> 25:24.960
was essentially fighting a losing battle here, 
because all of the as we used to call them in the

25:25.244 --> 25:39.803
department, physical, chemical, biological, 
geological, and somewhat more recently

25:25.244 --> 25:39.803
geophysical, all wanted to have their own sort of 
programs. So this idea of a kind of a basic common

25:40.324 --> 25:54.643
undergraduate preparation gave way to, again, 
more specialized optional programs in these sort

25:40.324 --> 25:54.643
of five fields. And I got out of sorts with this as 
the years went by. I think there's a swing in the

26:01.035 --> 26:10.968
other direction now, and they're beginning to 
feel that maybe there is some merit to having

26:01.035 --> 26:10.968
people with sort of broad training again. But it's 
taken 20 years or so for the pendulum to swing, and

26:10.988 --> 26:18.659
it hasn't moved very far in that direction. When 
you started choosing faculty, what sort of

26:19.500 --> 26:24.006
faculty did you look for? This is more or less kind 
of parallel to the students. There's no one to look

26:29.396 --> 26:31.959
for.

26:37.605 --> 26:52.542
When

26:37.605 --> 26:52.542
I came out here, Professor Thompson, who was a 
chemist and chemical oceanographer, Cliff

26:37.605 --> 26:52.542
Barnes, who was originally a chemist but more so a 
physical oceanographer, Morris Rattray, who had

26:53.112 --> 27:05.104
come in as of just finishing his PhD from Caltech, 
who was a theoretical hydrodynamicist, and

26:53.112 --> 27:05.104
myself. I think that was about it. We had really 
nobody in the geological area, nobody in the

27:08.528 --> 27:13.293
biological area. And so part of my job was to 
obviously try and find some people in these two

27:23.335 --> 27:24.236
sort of fields. And it turned out to be just as hard 
as it had been during the war and back in the

27:25.017 --> 27:35.209
Hydrographic Office to find anybody to go into 
these areas. And

27:35.969 --> 27:53.089
the first geological oceanographer I was able to 
add to the faculty was Howard Gould, who's now a and

27:53.575 --> 28:02.086
has been for a number of years with the Humble 
Research Laboratories in Houston. And he spent

28:02.206 --> 28:11.278
several years with us and then felt he wanted more 
money and so on, so he went to Humble. And the next

28:12.319 --> 28:21.111
geologist I recruited was Joe Krager, who was a 
brand new PhD out of Texas A&M. He was one of the very

28:21.131 --> 28:22.873
first of the PhDs. But these people had very little 
sort of experience themselves. I mean, they were,

28:30.661 --> 28:37.592
as the most recent PhDs, and they had to, in a sense, 
learn a lot on the job here. Not as far as this sort of

28:37.612 --> 28:42.299
research, I'm not saying that, but from a teaching 
point of view. The biologists turned out to be

28:43.300 --> 28:50.211
almost equally hard to find anybody who had who was 
not strictly a sort of a biologist, but had some of

28:50.782 --> 29:03.118
the interests of what I would identify as a 
biological oceanographer, which meant some

28:50.782 --> 29:03.118
other background. And

29:03.238 --> 29:11.169
this turned out to be, as they say, just as hard to 
find anybody there. And this has more or less

29:12.410 --> 29:17.717
persisted I think even up to today. And one of the 
things that strikes me all the time is that you can

29:20.791 --> 29:31.342
clearly find research people these days. Often, 
however, with really very narrow kind of

29:33.084 --> 29:42.273
preparation, but very few of them with any kind of 
teaching experience. Maybe one of our

29:44.815 --> 30:04.299
contributions here has been the fact that an awful 
lot of graduate students have been teaching

29:44.815 --> 30:04.299
assistants here, a kind of experience they never 
got in any of the other places, and do go out of here,

29:44.815 --> 30:04.299
not all of them, but a good many of them, with some 
kind of feeling about what the teaching job is. How

30:04.319 --> 30:05.220
are you doing?
