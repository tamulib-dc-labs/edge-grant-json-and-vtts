00:02.495 --> 00:06.139
Business A&M has made a strong contribution.

00:10.483 --> 00:20.793
I guess I would prefer it still be all male, all military, because that's the way it was when I went.

00:23.896 --> 00:25.077
What have we not included?

00:25.278 --> 00:31.624
I can think of only one more question I need to ask you, but have we left out some important topics?

00:33.342 --> 00:38.709
No, I think not, but I'll think of some tomorrow.

00:39.190 --> 00:41.293
Well, when we send the typescript back, we'll add.

00:42.234 --> 00:44.718
My last question then is this one.

00:44.738 --> 00:48.583
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M now?

00:51.447 --> 00:56.113
I think it is a place where I wanted my sons to go.

00:56.313 --> 00:59.037
One of them went, one of them didn't.

00:59.057 --> 01:01.881
Where I want my grandsons to go, three of them have gone.

01:02.165 --> 01:06.389
The three of them are going now and others will probably.

01:07.090 --> 01:22.365
I think it is a place that affords a young man a chance to learn how to conduct himself so as to be respected and admired.

01:22.405 --> 01:28.611
And it's very self-serving for me to say it.

01:29.266 --> 01:34.474
I am reasonably respected and admired for my life.

01:34.994 --> 01:47.593
From people that know me, I'm reasonably, I think more so having gone to A&M than I would be if I had gone someplace else.

01:47.613 --> 01:53.822
I think A&M has taught me a significant thing about

01:55.557 --> 02:16.570
how to conduct my life and it's given me people that I try to image myself after that I admire and respect and I think violence A&M was very good for me and I'm very

02:17.984 --> 02:19.726
I'm very indebted to A&M.

02:20.507 --> 02:26.192
I say in my life, I think I have been very successful.

02:26.713 --> 02:40.506
I'm well satisfied with the accomplishments I've made and I think I'm reasonably well respected for... You certainly are.

02:40.526 --> 02:46.152
...having gotten a good education and having used it.

02:47.380 --> 03:04.226
And I think a great deal of that's due to the fact that I had good professors at A&M and I had good people at A&M that led me to try to achieve what they have achieved.

03:05.889 --> 03:06.570
That's a good idea.
