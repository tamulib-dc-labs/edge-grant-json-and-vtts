WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:09.860
There were four children in Mother's family, so 
what she inherited from her family, then Dad

00:02.647 --> 00:09.860
doubled. So they had inherited land, and Dad 
actually made the last payment on the land. in

00:18.712 --> 00:23.698
December of 1969 and was dead in March of 70. Right, 
so financially, your mother's family was better,

00:24.199 --> 00:33.050
in Texas lingo, better off than your dad's family. 
Yeah, yeah. But if I had asked your dad's father

00:37.115 --> 00:42.983
what he did for a living, would he have said 
ranching?

00:46.787 --> 00:47.368
Farming? I don't know.

00:52.505 --> 00:56.431
They may have had a little plot of land here and 
there, but there was nothing handed down. Was your

00:57.653 --> 00:59.736
dad the first to go to college?

01:02.701 --> 01:02.922
Yes. What about on your mom's side of the family? 
Had either of her parents gone to college? The

01:07.025 --> 01:08.047
mother was a teacher. Her dad had like an eighth 
grade education. But her mom was a teacher. Her mom

01:11.473 --> 01:12.375
was a teacher. Because I'm thinking there, again, 
is the typical America. It was that generation

01:18.846 --> 01:23.094
that begins to make the difference in the 
educational level. Same true in my family. You're

01:26.680 --> 01:28.864
mom and dad's children. Oh, most all of that 
generation. All right. So you were kind of excited

01:36.295 --> 01:40.485
about moving here. Your mom's reaction, she 
came... I can't really say I was really excited

01:45.449 --> 01:48.453
about coming. I had really good friends in Austin. 
Oh, okay. And I had a boyfriend. I'm not there for a

01:51.897 --> 01:54.460
boyfriend. But once I got here, yeah. And you were 
well-received. Oh, yes. All right. And your mom,

02:00.186 --> 02:05.753
being a good wife, okay, if we're to move, do the 
best I can. What were the activities in which she

02:06.514 --> 02:11.119
plunged once she got here? You know, she had five 
children, and my brother Bob was tiny. He had just

02:16.929 --> 02:18.112
been born. He was born in 54, so he would have 
been... Oh, I hadn't thought about it. He's a

02:24.689 --> 02:25.130
little kid. He's little. And... So she really 
didn't have time to do PTA and a lot of that. There

02:32.792 --> 02:34.294
were too many. But what she did get into were all the 
things on campus. The social club is still there.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.966
Until she got sick, she really didn't miss 
meetings. Who were her closest personal friends

02:46.246 --> 02:50.610
in those early years? There was a group that wasn't 
in the very early years, but in a little bit after

02:51.451 --> 02:58.318
she'd been here for a while. developed the Ladies 
Aid Society. And it was Jean Graff and Frances

03:01.423 --> 03:13.793
Lindsey, Jim Lindsey's wife, and maybe Doris 
Hannigan and Minnie Pope Cherry. The Cherries and

03:14.363 --> 03:21.610
the Hannigans, as couples with mother and dad, 
those three couples were good friends. Now,

03:21.671 --> 03:23.012
that's Tom Cherry's wife. Tom Cherry's wife. Now, 
your dad brought from Austin...

03:24.974 --> 03:37.187
Mrs. Warren, the secretary? No. Oh, I forgot. Or 
Meg Warren. I'm not sure that she came

03:41.831 --> 03:43.493
immediately. that she had helped him in the land 
office. But I'm trying to think, went to

03:46.603 --> 03:56.332
Presbyterian Church, now deceased, who had been 
at the land office as the, as a fiscal. Diebel.

03:56.993 --> 03:57.694
Clark Diebel. Clark Diebel. Yeah. Tell me about 
the, about Clark Diebel and your dad's

03:59.516 --> 04:05.121
relationship with him. Yeah, I don't think I'm 
being much help to you, because I really, you know,

04:13.814 --> 04:17.980
I think that our generation has included children 
much more. And frankly, when I got there, I was so

04:18.821 --> 04:25.029
thrilled with all the activities at the high 
school. So I was really kind of busy doing my thing.

04:28.754 --> 04:32.259
All right, let's go to your dad's routine. I know 
Dad had the highest respect for Clark Diebel. I

04:35.683 --> 04:37.145
know there was a real bond there. And I understand 
that. that when to clean up the land office, that

04:38.823 --> 04:47.271
Clark was one of the key people in helping with 
that. All right, as you recall your dad's

04:47.291 --> 04:52.977
schedule, normally he headed to the office about 
what time of day? Early. How early was early? Do you

04:57.461 --> 04:59.783
remember things like that from when you were 16? 
No, but was it? I don't. I don't know that he was

05:01.565 --> 05:05.149
there for breakfast. And I assume school probably 
started at 8 o'clock. One summer in Austin, before

05:10.615 --> 05:30.546
we moved here, when I was 14, when it was still legal 
to work that age, I interviewed, and I'm sure Dad

05:10.615 --> 05:30.546
had set it up, and I worked that summer, just to take 
a course in typing, and I worked at the TEA,

05:10.615 --> 05:30.546
Teachers Education Agency, that was housed in the 
same building, the old land office building where

05:10.615 --> 05:30.546
Dad lived. And so that summer, he and I rode 
together, and I remember we went very early. And we

05:36.456 --> 05:38.479
stayed, you know. Was he home for supper most 
nights?

05:45.448 --> 05:46.650
Most nights. And do you remember his bringing a 
briefcase or a whole bunch of paper home? No,

05:51.235 --> 05:53.318
because he was two blocks from the office. He'd go 
back. Okay, he'd go back to the office. And do you

05:56.182 --> 05:59.266
remember his going back to the office many nights? 
You know, isn't that awful? I knew that. I probably

06:03.631 --> 06:05.053
would not remember. What about social events at 
the house? Were there many? There were. There

06:10.721 --> 06:14.065
were, because it was a grand old place for 
entertainment. And the staffing of the house, was

06:14.426 --> 06:17.870
there a cook? A maid? She was one and the same. There 
was a man and a woman. I started to say a couple, but

06:27.341 --> 06:29.924
that might imply more than it was. And they sort of 
shared the duties. When the board was in town, were

06:33.725 --> 06:39.972
you aware of a board meeting? Not back then. 
Because they would have been not far across the

06:42.836 --> 06:46.200
street. Now, the fire occurred, the house burned 
when? 63. Are you home? I was home for winter break

06:53.929 --> 06:57.333
from the University of Texas. And I remember... 
going off on an errand. I think I may have given

07:03.864 --> 07:06.208
Mother a permanent that morning. It was back when 
we did each other's home firms. And coming back and

07:11.377 --> 07:18.589
all this activity had started and you could see 
smoke out of the ceiling. Out the roof. Now this was

07:19.591 --> 07:21.394
during the Christmas break? January, yeah. Oh, 
okay. And what time of day? It seems like the boys

07:25.126 --> 07:31.957
were going to, the ones who were still on campus, 
were going to Meals at Savisa. And I just remember

07:32.718 --> 07:36.604
the windows in that old house went to the floor. And 
I just remember furniture being passed through.

07:40.771 --> 07:45.919
And I remembered stacks of dishes, and not one dish 
was broken. And it was all literally just hand to

07:46.169 --> 07:48.493
hand. So you're saying students and others? 
Students and everything. Mine was the back room

07:54.104 --> 08:04.964
and I had inherited from friends in Austin a lot of 
formals. And I can remember the net just flying.

08:09.237 --> 08:10.118
out the windows. Do you remember in hindsight any 
special things that may have been lost? Probably

08:18.027 --> 08:19.189
the pictures. When I left Brady, we had autograph 
books. And my little growing up friends, you know,

08:23.193 --> 08:28.239
we had autograph books and all those little 
pictures. And I'm still friends with a lot,

08:28.339 --> 08:33.085
several of us that grew up together. went to Santa 
Fe a couple years ago, and we still do things

08:33.385 --> 08:38.478
together. And a lot of those were lost. But no, in 
terms of financial value, the losses were

08:41.386 --> 08:46.720
moderate. Really, maybe the main thing, Dad had 
sent me a doll during the war, and it had a real gold

08:47.560 --> 08:54.011
skirt. And it was so fine, I was never allowed to 
play with it. I could just look at it. And that was

08:59.921 --> 09:01.724
lost.

09:04.289 --> 09:10.800
But like, he didn't lose any heirlooms or any World 
War II items that were priceless. There was some,

09:10.898 --> 09:24.616
like some of the, the crate that my doll came in that 
said, persists, that held a lot of the World War II

09:10.898 --> 09:24.616
mementos, made it through. The cedar chest that 
Daddy built with his own hands, made it, you know,

09:24.636 --> 09:32.427
it was scarred, but it made it through. And a lot of 
the stuff was in there. And I was more fortunate

09:34.996 --> 09:42.628
than my brothers and sisters because I had clothes 
in the sorority house at Texas. So I didn't lose

09:42.648 --> 09:44.672
everything. Whereas my little sisters, Linda 
can, they remember. In fact, she said it was the

09:48.618 --> 09:51.262
first time she can remember. I think Lester's and 
Braley's stayed open. And, you know, they went and

09:55.529 --> 10:00.497
picked out clothes because, I mean, they 
literally had none. And so your feelings about the

10:01.996 --> 10:08.025
assistance that students, faculty, everybody 
else can give. Oh, my goodness. And I can remember

10:09.808 --> 10:17.099
standing in the yard, and Daddy was such a big man, 
and I always felt so safe up beside him. And I can

10:17.159 --> 10:21.726
remember us standing there and just watching the 
flames come out. All right, so you're away on an

10:22.077 --> 10:26.101
errand or something. You come back, and it is 
beginning to burn. I think the trucks were already

10:30.126 --> 10:31.507
there. Okay. Yeah. So that it was an hour or so that 
it burns up. Okay, and all of this is- Seems like it

10:39.837 --> 10:42.159
burned for a long time. And it's all in daylight. 
Well, it seems like when I can remember, my memory

10:44.021 --> 10:52.050
of Dad and standing in that backyard, it was 
getting dark, or maybe the smoke made it dark. And

10:52.250 --> 10:56.980
it started up high around the chimney. Apparently 
the mortar had deteriorated between the bricks

10:57.000 --> 11:06.159
and the big fire that George Washington, the black 
man who was helping them. And it wasn't a terribly

11:07.181 --> 11:09.145
cold day, was it? No, but it seems like when we got in 
the next morning, it must have rained overnight

11:09.260 --> 11:26.225
because every now and then the scent, the smell of 
the burned house that we went in and it either

11:09.260 --> 11:26.225
frozen or there was something wet that I can seem to 
remember going in the next day. And so when they,

11:26.866 --> 11:33.055
quote, put it out, the shell of the house is left. 
And where'd y'all spend that first night? Over at

11:36.380 --> 11:38.743
the boardroom with Miss Cashin. in the old border 
house just north of Sevesa. And how long did your

11:42.405 --> 11:44.668
family stay there? They stayed there for several 
weeks and ate in Sevesa. And then the university

11:48.232 --> 11:55.802
bought the house on Lee Street where Mrs. Jessup 
lives now, Emily Jessup. And then do you know

11:57.404 --> 12:04.454
anything about where the idea came from to build 
another house where they built it? Mother says she

12:04.474 --> 12:06.216
and Doris Hannigan walked and had something to do 
with picking the side out. She could tell you

12:11.014 --> 12:11.855
better. Now, I've heard the story that your dad 
said that he picked the precise angle. Is that

12:19.466 --> 12:20.368
right? That he wanted to be the first one on the 
campus to see the sunrise. Can't you imagine him

12:25.375 --> 12:26.737
saying that? I can. I don't remember hearing that. 
I remember hearing about he didn't want the... You

12:32.335 --> 12:34.977
know, those gnarly old mesquite trees that are 
still there. He refused to let those be cut. And I

12:37.760 --> 12:45.527
remember him being very proud of the pediment over 
the front door, that he thought that was just fine.

12:45.888 --> 12:51.733
All right, now that little gully out kind of in 
front of the house that you have to cut, do you know

12:45.888 --> 12:51.733
why that gully is there? No. That's where they dug 
the clay for the bricks for Old May. Oh, my gosh. And

12:58.720 --> 13:01.262
they made the bricks on site. So that's one of them. 
All right, now let's see. Are those the same old

13:04.297 --> 13:08.305
bricks that then went back into the house? Some of 
those did, yes. Because there are old bricks used

13:10.048 --> 13:12.051
in that. Yes, some of those did. Oh, that's neat. 
Who designed it? Do you remember, did your mother

13:16.660 --> 13:20.667
or dad have anything to do with the design of the 
house? Yeah. Apparently a design was put forth

13:21.982 --> 13:27.588
maybe by some people in architecture, and I don't 
know names. And it was a very modern house being in

13:27.608 --> 13:30.510
the early 60s. And that was, I guess, not 
acceptable to a lot of people. Excuse me. So they

13:36.937 --> 13:41.742
worked with Dee Dee Matthews and Gene Donahoe. 
What was it, a year or so before? You know, I just,

13:43.363 --> 13:45.545
I'm trying to think. It was more than a year. I want 
to say they may have moved in in 65. after the

13:51.952 --> 13:55.335
January 63 fire. So that in square footage, the 
current President House may be smaller than the

13:55.776 --> 14:01.962
old one was? I

14:02.783 --> 14:06.566
don't know. I don't know. I didn't have that 
feeling. Oh, no. The bedrooms were bigger

14:14.474 --> 14:17.757
upstairs. And certainly it was finer. Now, are you 
out of college by the time you move into the new

14:19.976 --> 14:25.868
house? I guess I'm teaching in Houston. So you 
never lived there. What was your mom's reaction to

14:33.384 --> 14:35.488
the new house? She absolutely loved it. 
Absolutely loved it. And they were able to use some

14:41.925 --> 14:43.807
of the furniture. Downstairs, the old downless 
sofas with the down cushions were recovered. And

14:53.119 --> 14:54.881
those had been saved from the fire. And so there 
were a few things that are kind of in that formal

14:55.602 --> 14:58.566
front room. But the furniture that they were able 
to buy. And people were so kind to donate so much of

15:03.873 --> 15:08.719
the materials that were used that But it just 
seemed like it was something everybody was proud

15:09.138 --> 15:12.865
to have. Now, did your dad get involved much with 
the planning of the interior, or did you leave that

15:13.086 --> 15:18.797
to your mother? You'll have to ask her, because I 
don't know. But he was all... Dad, you know, with

15:22.003 --> 15:29.458
his degree in industrial education, I can 
remember him doing things like... When we lived in

15:30.282 --> 15:33.886
Brady, there was a surplus of bunk beds. So he 
bought bunk beds for, especially my sister's

15:34.467 --> 15:46.341
rooms, and then designed these headboards that 
slipped down over and you could put, you know,

15:34.467 --> 15:46.341
covered the whole things up so that they looked 
like these wonderful beds. So he was really, he

15:46.881 --> 15:56.513
was, Dad could spot problems or spot things that 
needed to be. I'm sure he was. What were his

15:57.854 --> 16:00.137
hobbies, his recreations? What did he do for fun? I 
think friends. Okay. He didn't, he never golfed,

16:07.680 --> 16:10.963
to my knowledge. We would walk a lot at night. Oh, 
where? Oh, well, I can remember visiting after

16:15.747 --> 16:20.953
they got into the new house. And so we would walk 
from there then toward the main campus. But from

16:25.036 --> 16:28.740
the old house, we would walk way out to the west 
campus. None of that was developed. You remember

16:32.419 --> 16:34.944
the road was always full of pits. But we would walk 
way, way out that way. And he was not walking to

16:39.692 --> 16:44.040
inspect or check on people? Oh, no. No, no. And who 
would go on the walk? Whoever was there. Would your

16:49.122 --> 16:50.283
mom go? Sure. Mother has always kind of had foot 
problems, so long walks were kind of not her thing.

16:56.571 --> 16:58.413
They were some of my favorite things. But you kids 
would go? Uh-huh. If y'all had a house guest, would

17:00.335 --> 17:03.659
some people? Mm-hmm. Now, I thought he hunted 
some. He did, when we would go to the ranch, yeah.

17:13.631 --> 17:16.275
But that wasn't that big of a thing? Do you have 
friends who are hunters? I'm sure you do. Mm-hmm.

17:19.379 --> 17:20.901
Dad was never like that. And he didn't have a 
sit-down hobby, did he? No. He didn't collect

17:28.250 --> 17:29.993
stamps? He loved, like, kind of a regular Sunday 
afternoon would be to go to church and then dinner

17:30.453 --> 17:42.208
and then maybe a little nap and then a long drive. He 
loved to get out in the country and... See what was

17:45.637 --> 17:46.918
blooming. If there, on a Saturday, if there wasn't 
a football game, what would he do on a Saturday? He

17:54.026 --> 18:00.914
had classes Saturday morning, I know, but the 
Saturday afternoon, Saturday

17:54.026 --> 18:00.914
evening. I know. Let's see, Methodist, you know, 
and you all went to the A&M Methodist Church. And

18:05.940 --> 18:09.223
Pinky Downs usually came down and sat with us. And 
he would bring Dad, I can still see, he would check

18:09.243 --> 18:15.070
stories, like if the story was here, He would have 
these real hard, he would check all around the

18:15.320 --> 18:21.650
story that dad was told. And he would bring 
newspapers. And circle the story. Now as far as you

18:26.318 --> 18:33.509
know, was your dad well acquainted with Pinky 
before y'all moved here? I have no, see I don't know

18:33.529 --> 18:35.392
that. My brother would come to football games with 
dad. But I never did that, so I don't know. All

18:42.202 --> 18:49.131
right,

18:42.202 --> 18:49.131
at the Methodist Church, you all went regularly. 
Did you children have an option when you were in

18:49.151 --> 18:52.395
high school? What if you had said, I don't want to go 
this morning? When I had to, you're talking to the

18:54.298 --> 19:01.527
big sister that has one of those pins with all the 
bars for perfect attendance. And truly, it

19:01.747 --> 19:04.691
started in Brady. And I can remember sitting more 
with my grandmother in church than sitting with

19:04.711 --> 19:09.998
mother and dad. But you're also demonstrating it 
never occurred to you not to go, did it? No. Same

19:16.015 --> 19:16.436
here. Yeah. We do. What else do you do on Sunday 
morning? And when my kids got to the point they

19:21.167 --> 19:24.915
didn't want to do that, I'd say, you know. So the 
only thing I could do was hold lunch over their

19:26.245 --> 19:28.828
heads. So Sunday school and church. NYF. In the 
early evenings was very important. All right. Did

19:38.260 --> 19:41.825
y'all have a Sunday night preaching then? Mm-hmm. 
James R.Q.? Did you ever know James R.Q.? Oh, yeah.

19:46.511 --> 19:49.175
He was here, and he was wonderful. Now, I heard a few 
people who thought that in order to really make

19:52.148 --> 19:56.972
progress as an A&M administrator, you had to be a 
Methodist. I heard that too. I heard that too. I

20:01.476 --> 20:08.262
guess there's always probably one church in a 
community that small that most people go to. And as

20:09.242 --> 20:20.292
you were growing up, you can never remember when 
Texas A&M wasn't mentioned warmly. Oh, our house

20:20.312 --> 20:21.733
in Brady. I had maroon and white towels.

20:26.945 --> 20:29.409
But A&M for years was just something I heard about. 
Yeah. And your brothers, it never occurred to them

20:32.293 --> 20:37.461
that they would have an option as to where they 
would go to school? No. No. And really, you were

20:39.624 --> 20:42.529
asking about that when I got ready to go to college. 
Dad said, really, sister, your choice is your TWU

20:42.589 --> 20:45.333
or Texas. And that wasn't a tough choice at that 
time. Do you remember going to Mustard's? You

20:54.307 --> 20:55.028
know, I don't. See, muster now is much bigger than 
it used to be. Is that right? Oh, see, Sterling

20:59.740 --> 21:06.350
Evans doesn't remember a muster before World War 
II. I was really not encouraged to do university

21:06.370 --> 21:10.257
things. I mean, I was a 16-year-old. So, be who you 
are. Absolutely. uh very very good uh let's see uh

21:15.815 --> 21:42.548
and your mother of course although she had gone to 
the university of texas it she had been married to

21:15.815 --> 21:42.548
an aggie long enough that it had she had no 
emotional adjustment problem you know do you

21:15.815 --> 21:42.548
remember now you don't mention any names if you 
have any do you remember anybody any rudeness that

21:15.815 --> 21:42.548
your parents experienced when they got here Oh, I 
couldn't imagine anybody being rude to my dad. No,

21:47.588 --> 21:50.332
I have no recollection of that. Now, you were 
saying that one of the kids said, Earl, we're here.

21:57.804 --> 22:03.333
Do you remember any other teasing names that 
students or anybody else used to refer to your dad?

22:07.861 --> 22:10.265
Because his name was James Earl, wasn't it? 
Mm-hmm. But I never heard anybody call him, refer

22:10.928 --> 22:16.836
to him as Jimmy or J-E. Only the Rangers, you know, 
in the service. He was Jim or Big Jim. Oh, really?

22:20.141 --> 22:21.042
Yeah. Yeah. You know, because they go so strictly 
by your first name. That's right. Yeah. So in the

22:26.270 --> 22:29.054
war, apparently. Yeah. At the time you all moved 
here, your dad was physically, what was he, six

22:31.938 --> 22:37.686
feet tall? He was six feet. Yeah, was he 6 or was he 
taller? I don't know. Maybe he was 6'2". He was a big

22:45.905 --> 22:47.527
man. By what would he have weighed? Oh, very, 
probably 235. Because I've heard him, two or three

22:53.015 --> 22:59.345
years later, I heard him refer to himself 
occasionally. Potbelly present. And I don't

23:00.526 --> 23:04.833
remember him having a potbelly. Maybe I didn't 
observe, but I didn't. So I always thought, well,

23:07.797 --> 23:17.391
he was trying to disarm everybody from not being 
too serious. What do you think made him most proud

23:18.193 --> 23:25.664
of his years here? What do you think he was? I think 
the growth. I think the growth was really

23:32.894 --> 23:37.281
important, and sort of the change in attitude. 
toward A&M. That, you know, when he came it was

23:41.051 --> 23:50.724
small and it was strictly military and that's why 
I'm sure he was chosen to come. That's what I

23:51.525 --> 23:52.446
understand. But he was wise enough to have the 
vision that

23:52.466 --> 24:00.838
it couldn't stay that way. Do you particularly 
share with me, if you can, anything that you recall

24:01.291 --> 24:12.547
about his feelings on co-education and making a 
co-volunteer? You know, I really don't. And when I

24:17.414 --> 24:27.889
try to think of something specific to remember 
about how he felt, I think the way he would,

24:17.414 --> 24:27.889
wherever we were, he would introduce himself. I'm 
Earl Gutter, I'm from Texas A&M. And that almost,

24:32.549 --> 24:36.876
just his pride in that. I'm. Because I think I told 
you the other day, when I got back the first draft

24:39.080 --> 24:53.263
that I had written of the Aspirations Report that 
had those recommendations, he had some, he had

24:39.080 --> 24:53.263
some very tough questions. Why this, why this, why 
that? And I had assumed that he was wondering what

24:55.240 --> 25:08.916
those questions really meant is can we make it, can 
we get the board to approve it, can we get the people

24:55.240 --> 25:08.916
to support it? I read nothing into it that he was 
saying I'm opposed to it. And let me elucidate a

25:15.564 --> 25:18.948
little more on that. There was a referendum soon 
after that during that academic year, a

25:23.843 --> 25:30.701
referendum of the student body on these two 
questions. Overwhelmingly, the students

25:30.721 --> 25:32.806
approved. We're having a faculty meeting in the 
old chemistry lecture of arts and sciences And

25:39.773 --> 25:44.658
your dad, as was his pattern, would speak to each of 
the college faculties once a year. And this was

25:44.758 --> 25:48.282
Arts and Sciences Day. And so we were not going to 
have a faculty referendum. And we faculty were

25:52.427 --> 25:54.429
really uptight about that. You know, why in the 
world? And in his remarks, he didn't say a single

25:56.331 --> 26:01.757
thing about faculty referendum. So there were 
questions and answers. And they said, OK, now

26:03.639 --> 26:06.102
there's time for one more question. I'm sitting in 
the next to back row, and I raise my hand, and I think

26:06.942 --> 26:18.538
it was Cooper recognized, and I stood up, and I was 
so frightened that my voice quivered. And I said,

26:19.399 --> 26:24.746
you know, Mr. President, there's a referendum 
tomorrow for students. Why aren't you having a

26:24.766 --> 26:27.189
faculty referendum? And he then chuckled and 
said, hell, I don't need to have a faculty

26:27.209 --> 26:30.734
referendum. I know y'all are all in favor of these 
things. Everybody said, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

26:33.017 --> 26:35.380
meeting adjourned. And as we walked out, most of my 
buddies walked by and said, where are you working

26:36.136 --> 26:40.480
next year? Well, now we're about seven, eight 
years later. This is the last session I ever had

26:46.847 --> 26:48.949
with your dad. And I was in there begging for more 
money for the library, as chairman of the library

26:49.089 --> 26:53.794
committee. And in the end of the conversation, I 
said, do you remember that question I asked you

26:53.814 --> 26:58.219
that day? And he said, yes. And I remember how 
frightened you were. I was dumbfounded that his

27:03.423 --> 27:07.827
memory was that sharp. Also, I want to mention to 
you, in that conversation, I then said... He

27:12.411 --> 27:13.212
really had. He really had. I don't care how gruff he 
had to be to get stuff done, he did have such a tender

27:14.974 --> 27:19.618
heart. And you see, some of us didn't know that for a 
while. And I said, we're talking about all these

27:23.342 --> 27:25.444
changes. I said, only you could have done it. And he 
said, what do you mean? Now, by this time, you know

27:28.006 --> 27:32.130
how you kind of sometimes sit around... And he 
said, what do you mean? I said, well, sir, they

27:35.408 --> 27:52.467
couldn't say you weren't a Texan, that you weren't 
an Aggie, that you hadn't been in the Corps, that

27:35.408 --> 27:52.467
you hadn't served your country, that you didn't 
work hard, that you didn't have a strong personal

27:35.408 --> 27:52.467
private life, that, you know, there wasn't any 
gossip or anything out there. They couldn't say

27:52.827 --> 28:02.758
you didn't know your way around Austin and that you 
weren't acquainted with people named Connelly

27:52.827 --> 28:02.758
and Johnson and Teague and Pickle and things like 
that. and that you were one of those fuddy-duddy

28:03.262 --> 28:08.327
PhDs from somewhere way off. He leaned back and he 
said, oh, I never thought about any of that. I said,

28:11.550 --> 28:13.552
oh, I'm sure you didn't. Well, by then he was 
chocolate.

28:21.020 --> 28:29.148
And did you sense in him satisfaction that 
progress was being made in the 60s? No. You have to

28:29.671 --> 28:32.996
remember, too, I finished high school in 1960. I 
went three years to Austin and finished there. I

28:38.044 --> 28:41.189
taught two years in Houston, and then I went to 
Massachusetts. I taught there, and then I moved to

28:41.249 --> 28:43.212
Michigan. But by then, the enrollment was going. 
So my contact, especially after the mid-'60s,

28:45.375 --> 28:54.750
you didn't call like we do now. We sure didn't 
travel like we do now. So I really missed a lot of

28:58.604 --> 29:02.328
that. And A&M was really, really making great 
progress during those days. One of the big deals

29:11.838 --> 29:21.868
when I was teaching in Newton, Massachusetts, was 
Dad was going to be on, I think it was the Today Show,

29:11.838 --> 29:21.868
and was going to be interviewed by Sandra Van Oker. 
And my principal made arrangements to have a TV so

29:21.983 --> 29:29.272
that I could watch Dad on national television. And 
I've got a feeling that his confidence of doing

29:30.214 --> 29:39.826
that was about where yours was, asking that 
question. He was so ill at ease. Alright, now, what

29:43.411 --> 29:51.501
do you think of his

29:43.411 --> 29:51.501
duties until the Which part of his duties do you 
think he enjoyed most and enjoyed least? Most he

29:57.451 --> 29:58.913
probably enjoyed the students. Okay. Like he 
didn't enjoy speech making? No. He didn't enjoy

30:03.359 --> 30:05.261
speech making. What about going to Austin and 
Washington to work directly with the key leaders?

30:11.049 --> 30:11.750
Did he enjoy that? You know, I never remember Dad 
complaining about anything that he had. You know,

30:21.822 --> 30:26.408
I never remember regrets.

30:27.509 --> 30:33.056
I never remember spoken

30:27.509 --> 30:33.056
hate that just wasn't in his name. If it was the job, 
you did it. And I think I inherited that from him. I

30:38.403 --> 30:40.086
think my kids have inherited that. You know, you 
just... Life doesn't come to you on a platter. And

30:45.172 --> 30:48.677
you just... Whatever the job is, you do it. I have 
the impression that... And I think one day he kind

30:52.079 --> 30:58.185
of referred to this in a brief conversation. I have 
the impression that Governor John Connolly would

30:58.966 --> 31:09.236
sometimes chat directly with your dad about 
suggested board appointments. I can remember

31:10.598 --> 31:14.942
when I was in Austin that dad would come and meet 
with Governor Connolly. And I remember getting to

31:14.962 --> 31:21.529
go pick dad up one day and getting introduced to 
Governor Connolly and just being so charmed. But

31:22.133 --> 31:32.830
for dad to then turn around and tell me at lunch what 
they talked about just was not his nature. Because

31:33.151 --> 31:39.561
I have the impression that even the problems too, 
that he kept those inside. I assume. I assume.
