00:01.853 --> 00:05.900
I anticipate that there will be hardly any black 
oil industry in the United States. Currently,

00:06.000 --> 00:10.167
we're at a level of about 6 million barrels a day. 
Forty years from now, I would anticipate we'll be

00:10.227 --> 00:16.859
below a million barrels of black oil per day. Gas 
production, currently we're running about 17

00:17.700 --> 00:21.787
trillion cubic feet a year. I would not be 
surprised 40 years from now, that we may still be at

00:25.310 --> 00:28.913
14, 15 trillion cubic feet a year. We do have a 
pretty fair gas reserve that's left unexplored.

00:33.677 --> 00:37.481
But black oil, we're essentially out of black oil 
reserves. People say that you can't deplete oil.

00:41.044 --> 00:42.345
You need to go to Ukraine. Ukraine at one time was 
producing 3 million barrels of oil a day back in the

00:43.526 --> 00:48.511
40s. They're probably producing less than 
300,000 barrels a day. and there's essentially no

00:54.233 --> 00:55.816
place to drill. It's just an area that was drilled 
over. Romania is the same thing. Romania was a huge

00:59.882 --> 01:05.752
producer in the 2030s and 40s, and they're 
essentially depleted. So barring the

01:05.772 --> 01:14.167
development of cold fusion or nuclear fusion, the 
oil industry is going to be around producing

01:05.772 --> 01:14.167
energy. They're going to be around producing 
energy, predominantly gas. Gas production in

01:18.193 --> 01:19.836
19... 94, 95, wellhead value will exceed the value 
of oil production for the first time. And it will

01:27.778 --> 01:30.821
continue to be a bigger and bigger share. And where 
are the gas reserves in the rest of the world? I

01:37.109 --> 01:38.450
mean, outside of the United States? Outside of the 
U.S. Part of the greatest gas reserves that are

01:38.490 --> 01:42.655
known are in Russia. There's tremendous gas 
reserves. The United States probably has 160

01:44.697 --> 01:48.962
trillion feet of gas, of proven gas reserves. 
Russia probably has at least 10 times that amount

01:52.199 --> 02:00.590
that there have been discovery wells drilled in. 
They have not developed them because they don't

02:00.890 --> 02:04.194
have the pipeline outlets for it. Indonesia has 
tremendous gas reserves, wells that are capable

02:06.717 --> 02:13.085
of producing 100 billion feet a day. Average well 
in the United States produces less than half a

02:13.987 --> 02:18.392
million feet. Indonesia, as well, is capable of 
producing 200 times what our average will. The

02:23.927 --> 02:29.131
problem is that there's no population centers 
that can utilize that much gas. Saudi Arabia has a

02:31.173 --> 02:33.636
tremendous amount of gas. Libya has a lot of gas. 
But, of course, to liquefy this is very expensive.

02:39.361 --> 02:44.386
It runs $5, $6 an MCF to liquefy natural gas and use 
it. And it's just not competitive with fuel oil at

02:44.566 --> 02:48.109
this time. So it has to, the supply, the production 
needs to be near the end users. Yes, right. Now

02:55.740 --> 03:04.349
Russia is close enough to Europe that eventually, 
probably in the next 10 years, there will be major

02:55.740 --> 03:04.349
pipeline construction. You need something on the 
order of probably $5 billion worth of pipeline

03:06.491 --> 03:11.937
construction to get Russian gas into Europe. Now, 
there are some pipelines in there now, but they're

03:15.735 --> 03:19.419
not in there. Where does Western, or even Eastern 
Europe, stand in energy for the future? Eastern

03:24.684 --> 03:29.828
Europe is pretty energy deficient. I mean, they 
import a lot out of the, of course, the Dutch North

03:29.929 --> 03:36.395
Sea. British North Sea has brought in a lot. 
Norway. And a lot comes from Russia. But the

03:42.697 --> 03:47.882
Russian, of course, imports are declining now. 
But there's a good bit of energy over there. And of

03:51.445 --> 03:53.907
course, they're not very far away from Saudi 
either. You can bring in Saudi crude easily. So is

03:57.470 --> 04:01.714
it that they don't have it in the ground, or are they 
like the Soviets and not able to get it out? They

04:01.894 --> 04:03.495
just simply don't have it. Romania has had old, old 
fields that are essentially depleted. There's

04:07.499 --> 04:12.163
not very much prospect in Poland, virtually none 
in Italy. Spain has very poor prospects. Some in

04:16.858 --> 04:20.442
the Paris Basin in France, but not big reserves. A 
little bit in Germany, but there's really not a lot

04:21.884 --> 04:27.851
of onshore production in Europe. How will the 
rules of our industry change? How will the rules of

04:33.898 --> 04:37.662
the game change with changing environmental 
standards?

04:40.578 --> 04:50.612
Well, the industry is really a lot further 
developed environmentally than most people,

04:40.578 --> 04:50.612
particularly outside the industry, think. There 
was a lot of excesses, a lot of damage to

04:51.252 --> 04:56.580
environmental situations in the 30s. Wells blew 
out. They let them blow out, catch on fire. We ran

05:00.645 --> 05:09.437
oil down the creeks, flared gas, ran salt water on 
the ground. The commissions began tightening the

05:10.278 --> 05:21.373
rules, the state commissions, oil and gas 
commissions, railroad commission, began

05:10.278 --> 05:21.373
tightening the rules in the early 50s. By the early 
60s, they were enforcing these rules. They were

05:27.722 --> 05:31.187
requiring cement jobs be inspected. They reduced 
all saltwater disposal out on the ground.

05:38.476 --> 05:41.099
carefully control the completion of wells. I 
would say by the early 70s, the environmental

05:42.280 --> 05:50.290
controls in the petroleum industry were strictly 
in place. Now, some of the things that they're

05:52.733 --> 06:04.306
talking about today certainly is going to be some 
problems, but we're a lot further along

05:52.733 --> 06:04.306
controlling our environmental problems than 
people realize that we are. And we started a long

06:04.326 --> 06:08.331
time ago, long before it became fashionable to 
talk about So you don't think that that's going to

06:08.834 --> 06:12.998
continue to change our costs, our ability to 
survive? I think it'll have some impact on it, and

06:13.098 --> 06:23.469
of course they always talk about some scary 
things, but generally we don't see it as a major

06:13.098 --> 06:23.469
problem. We routinely police our locations, 
looking for any type of spills and this type of

06:24.971 --> 06:31.177
thing. We try to run clean operations, and I think 
most people do. Can you give me an example or two

06:35.601 --> 06:37.103
about How strict the regulations that we operate 
are under are? Well, we ran about two barrels of

06:41.882 --> 06:53.476
salt water inadvertently in a creek in West 
Virginia when we were operating there in 1979. And

06:53.997 --> 06:57.341
they put our superintendent in jail. So not that we 
didn't intend to do it, but they certainly had our

06:57.942 --> 07:02.648
attention a long time ago. And this was not very 
salty water either. They're quite strictly

07:07.677 --> 07:10.582
enforced. For example, if you go to cement a well 
today, you have to file a permit long in advance,

07:10.602 --> 07:31.575
you have to notify the Railroad Commission where 
the water sands are, you've got to run pipe through

07:10.602 --> 07:31.575
all those sands, you've got to cement very 
carefully, and in all probability there will be an

07:10.602 --> 07:31.575
inspector on location to see that you cemented it 
properly. When you go to plug wells, there are very

07:32.213 --> 07:38.159
strict plugging requirements that we didn't have 
30 years ago. But I think most of the environmental

07:40.561 --> 07:47.327
requirements are pretty well in place. Looking at 
the numbers for 1993, it shows that we have 575,000

07:47.347 --> 07:51.091
wells. That's oil wells, I believe. You're right, 
that's oil wells. The total wells are 865,000.

08:02.572 --> 08:15.791
If we have to be very careful about the way we plug 
wells, and if we're getting less and less money

08:02.572 --> 08:15.791
from each well that we have to plug, are we going to 
have enough money to plug adequately all the wells

08:02.572 --> 08:15.791
that we have? Well, to be an operator in any state, 
when you drill a well or you take over a well, you're

08:16.512 --> 08:24.383
required to be bonded. You're required to have the 
money. You either put it up in cash or put up a bond to

08:27.026 --> 08:30.992
plug that well. Now, I guess there are some wells 
that go through bankruptcy and some things like

08:32.035 --> 08:37.722
that, that there may be some loopholes in it. But I 
would say that an extremely high percentage of the

08:37.782 --> 08:46.892
wells, the plugging costs are already in place. 
The largest oil field in Alabama is the Citronella

08:46.992 --> 08:49.675
unit. I've been the engineering manager there for 
many years. We have an escrow fund that within

08:53.580 --> 08:59.967
another three years, the field will last another 
10 or 15 years. then three more years we will have

09:00.554 --> 09:07.002
enough cash on hand to plug all of our wells at the 
time that's required to plug them. So we're

09:07.623 --> 09:11.387
looking ahead to our plugging requirements.

09:15.172 --> 09:30.291
Do you have any other, back to policy, domestic 
policy, have there been any big domestic policy

09:15.172 --> 09:30.291
dodges or anything that they could have done 
better?

09:30.659 --> 09:39.068
The petroleum industry is so divided that there's 
really no clear action that is recommended from

09:30.659 --> 09:39.068
the industry that would help them. There's talks 
of tax breaks. There's talks of lesser royalties

09:41.430 --> 09:46.055
on offshore production. There's discussion of 
opening up federal lands that have been put off

09:46.075 --> 09:52.542
limits for drilling. Frankly, I think these are 
all mandates that really are not going to do very

09:53.623 --> 10:00.430
much for the industry. solution that I've ever 
seen that would have any consequence and it would

10:00.832 --> 10:16.087
save stripper production to some extent is if the 
federal government would put a floor under the

10:00.832 --> 10:16.087
import price of oil, say at $20 a barrel. This would 
automatically raise the price of oil to $20 a

10:17.689 --> 10:29.100
barrel and if they bring it in below that, well then 
the government just takes the profit out of it.

10:29.587 --> 10:37.554
This is terribly unpopular, and I don't think that 
there is any political support. If you've got 100

10:39.515 --> 10:42.798
senators, I doubt you'd get one of them to vote for 
it. I don't see any other solution. I think the

10:45.941 --> 10:54.128
other things are simply short-term band-aids for 
the industry.

10:54.148 --> 10:57.330
I'm trying to look over my notes. I don't see...

11:02.847 --> 11:30.795
don't see any other any other questions i had is 
there anything else about the history of the oil

11:02.847 --> 11:30.795
and gas the last 30 years that is important that we 
haven't talked about i think that we've covered

11:02.847 --> 11:30.795
certainly the major factors in it we've covered 
employment the capital expenditure levels we've

11:02.847 --> 11:30.795
talked about low supply of oil and gas where we're 
going some view of where we're going on the

11:02.847 --> 11:30.795
international scene i think you've covered Most 
of the topics are consequences. All right. Thank

11:34.806 --> 11:35.493
you very much. Yes, sir.
