00:01.803 --> 00:13.881
I inferred from your work on disarmament and so 
forth that you would have been in effect opposed to

00:01.803 --> 00:13.881
international cooperation in terms of weapon 
systems and so forth. Well, what I'm opposed to is

00:15.043 --> 00:16.646
wars. And what I'm interested in is the reduction 
of the chance of war. Now clearly, if you take the

00:24.538 --> 00:30.747
two extremes, If the United States became 
extremely aggressive, started to build up

00:31.705 --> 00:42.775
arguments on, say, twice the present scale, this 
would be destabilizing. It would force the

00:42.795 --> 00:50.022
opposition to do the same thing and might well 
precipitate a preemptive war. I mean, it is not

00:50.823 --> 00:55.748
safe in the modern world to have an extremely 
aggressive policy. On the other hand, it's quite

00:56.588 --> 01:00.052
unsafe to disarm. I mean, obviously, if the 
Russians The government wouldn't last six

01:02.654 --> 01:04.376
months. They get themselves blown up. And 
country-wise, so there must be some policy in

01:07.678 --> 01:13.043
between which is optimum from this point of view. 
And my own view is that the present levels of force

01:13.724 --> 01:23.733
are set by a competition with the Russians. We have 
to have as many tanks as the Russians, as many

01:23.753 --> 01:28.337
ballistic missiles as the Russians, and so on. And 
that the levels are excessive. that the present

01:32.523 --> 01:41.514
levels are more than is required for deterrence, 
and that this is dangerous, that we're erring on

01:32.523 --> 01:41.514
the top side. But the only way of reducing it is to 
reduce by agreement. And there are very strong

01:46.760 --> 01:55.011
reasons, I think, for reaching agreements to 
reduce mutually. The difficulties, of course,

01:55.051 --> 02:01.939
are verification and so on, but the Deterrence is 
so much in excess of any conceivable requirement

02:02.510 --> 02:14.465
that I think a moderate degree of cheating would 
not really do you any harm. I mean, we would be no

02:15.367 --> 02:22.756
better off if the Russians had their present level 
of ballistic missiles and we had twice as many.

02:23.457 --> 02:25.800
We'd be no safer at all, not the least. Because 
already there are sufficient missiles on both

02:26.388 --> 02:42.312
sides to ensure the complete destruction of the 
other society, plus a considerable margin over

02:26.388 --> 02:42.312
for dealing with third parties who might 
intervene. And the thing is, the damage that will

02:42.953 --> 02:51.366
be done is so out of proportion of the object in view 
that I think anyone who has any knowledge, I don't

02:51.903 --> 03:00.976
know anyone who has any knowledge of this matter, 
who doesn't think that the levels ought to be

02:51.903 --> 03:00.976
reduced, and they can only be reduced by 
negotiation. And even the Verdi-Vostok

03:01.897 --> 03:19.142
Agreement I was in favour of, because it sets a 
level, it sets levels rather above the present

03:01.897 --> 03:19.142
levels, which are ludicrously high for any 
requirement, but you can at least, at least then

03:01.897 --> 03:19.142
becomes, if you have an agreement, it becomes a 
numerical map. And on the whole, Congress is not

03:19.814 --> 03:23.077
very interested in numbers. I mean, they don't 
know the difference between 3,000 warheads and

03:23.778 --> 03:27.762
100 warheads. I once tried an experiment on this. I 
was in a meeting, I think I was chairman of the

03:32.927 --> 03:44.838
meeting, discussing what was a level of effective 
deterrence from the point of view of England. And

03:44.878 --> 03:49.062
this was a fairly technical discussion of the 
defence book. And we were talking about this, and

03:50.138 --> 03:54.964
the Foreign Office had asked whether they could 
just come in and listen. We said we didn't want to

03:55.425 --> 04:01.814
discuss the questions of what was politically 
acceptable, we just wanted to discuss the

03:55.425 --> 04:01.814
technical question. I mean, like reliability of 
missiles, number reaching the target, all this

04:01.834 --> 04:07.621
kind of amount of damage done, all this kind of 
thing. And I said, towards the end of the meeting, I

04:07.641 --> 04:11.887
said, look, we've got the Foreign Office here. 
They're the people who will, in effect, make the

04:12.788 --> 04:18.095
decision to use these things or not to use them. I'd 
like to ask them a very simple question. I said,

04:20.885 --> 04:31.317
suppose that there is a 50% chance of one megaton 
landing on Piccadilly Circus, and this is a risk

04:20.885 --> 04:31.317
you might have to take. For what would you take this 
risk? What desirable things are there in the world

04:34.421 --> 04:41.890
for which you would take a 50% risk of one megaton on 
Piccadilly Circus? The foreigners' reaction was

04:42.711 --> 04:44.653
very interesting. They had no notice of this 
question. They just looked poor.

04:50.669 --> 04:52.792
there's no such thing. There's nothing. I said, 
not the Middle East oil? He said, no, of course not.

04:58.081 --> 04:59.623
Not the control of the Indian Ocean? No, nothing. 
And it was quite clear that for him, effective

05:02.267 --> 05:11.882
deterrence was somewhere below a 50% chance of one 
megaton on Piccadilly Circus. Well, there you

05:13.044 --> 05:15.708
are, you see. That, in fact, In the real world, 
people will not deliberately plan a war if there

05:17.450 --> 05:27.084
are high probabilities of the major towns being 
destroyed.

05:28.446 --> 05:46.613
So that the levels are excessive and the present 
levels are defended on grounds that it might be

05:28.446 --> 05:46.613
possible for the other side, if they had a 
sufficient preponderance, to destroy all our

05:28.446 --> 05:46.613
weapons before they fire. This is not really 
numerically plausible. I mean, how many... After

05:51.025 --> 05:59.855
all, three or four weapons left will destroy the 
major cities of the other side. And how many shots

06:00.636 --> 06:10.188
have you got to have at each ballistic missile silo 
or each submarine to ensure a high probability

06:00.636 --> 06:10.188
that all but one or two were destroyed? Well, it's 
not all. So I think no one... With much lower levels

06:12.610 --> 06:17.376
of deterrence than we have now, No one would 
rationally start a war. And on the whole, the

06:20.378 --> 06:25.844
chances of accidentally starting a war are 
increased with the level of forces. So from the

06:26.004 --> 06:29.127
accidental war point of view, it pays you to reduce 
them. From the deliberate war point of view, I

06:30.088 --> 06:35.254
think, it also pays you to reduce them. Because if 
anyone had a war, it would do less damage. And the

06:37.996 --> 06:39.478
deterrence is just as good. So I think I'm 
perfectly consistent. I'm interested in

06:43.522 --> 06:44.764
disarmament. I'm interested in disarmament. not 
for emotional reasons, but to reduce the chance

06:46.330 --> 06:52.519
and the consequences of nuclear war. And I don't 
think disarmament to zero is necessarily the

06:53.541 --> 06:57.667
optimum. The most important thing, I think, at the 
moment is to decrease the effectiveness of the

06:57.687 --> 07:04.477
tank. You see, there is a risk of the Russians 
feeling that attack on Russia and on America is

07:05.438 --> 07:14.532
completely deterred. And therefore, they could 
safely drive their tanks across Europe. And it's

07:19.293 --> 07:36.973
well known that a few years ago, there was a 
detailed analysis of this by well informed

07:19.293 --> 07:36.973
people, which was leaked to Der Spiegel, I think, 
and published, which arrived at the conclusion

07:19.293 --> 07:36.973
that the Russians could not be held for a week 
before they reached the Rhine. Well now, if they

07:37.774 --> 07:44.181
tried that, it is an extremely dangerous 
situation, because beyond doubt, We would use

07:44.482 --> 07:48.368
tactical nuclear weapons after about day two. 
Now, there isn't in fact such a thing as a tactical

07:48.388 --> 07:52.473
nuclear weapon. There's really no distinction. 
And we would certainly use so-called tactical

07:54.496 --> 08:00.685
nuclear weapons to destroy bridges back in 
Poland. And very soon we'd be using them to destroy

08:01.667 --> 08:06.313
tank factories. And the thing would escalate, I 
think, in spite of the deterrence. I think it's a

08:09.498 --> 08:13.003
great danger of such an enterprise escalating. 
And so I think the important things at the moment

08:14.232 --> 08:34.675
are to... Well, I can't talk about what has 
actually happened, what the present situation

08:14.232 --> 08:34.675
is, but the situation in which the tank was a very 
effective weapon, which certainly existed five

08:14.232 --> 08:34.675
or ten years ago, is a very dangerous situation. 
And I don't know, or at least I don't know what the

08:35.436 --> 08:40.501
situation is at the moment. Come in. After the 
tape's off, I'll make a comment on that, by the way.

08:44.757 --> 08:50.163
My comments are not important.

08:54.948 --> 09:04.799
What about the risk in building nuclear energy 
plants, for example, if you don't... Well, I mean,

08:54.948 --> 09:04.799
clearly, this is a very important question 
indeed. I mean, it's not a negligible question.

09:11.487 --> 09:11.847
I think The difficulty in public discussion of 
this is quite a general one. It is this, that if in a

09:18.541 --> 09:31.600
certain activity you have a risk, now what 
arguments do you use for taking or not taking this

09:18.541 --> 09:31.600
risk? The trouble with the Sierra Club and the 
ecological lobby generally is that they argue

09:32.802 --> 09:41.935
that if we do this, There will be disadvantages, 
certain adverse things, undesirable things,

09:42.640 --> 09:51.869
which will certainly happen. There will also be 
risks of catastrophes of one sort and another.

09:57.274 --> 09:58.775
Therefore, we should not do this. Therefore, we 
oppose this. The trouble with this line of

10:01.458 --> 10:07.984
argument is that it can be used against all 
alternative causes of action. So you're left with

10:08.004 --> 10:09.846
no causes of action. They may be different groups 
that oppose the different ones, or they may be the

10:10.720 --> 10:16.110
same one. Now, in fact, I think it is true that all 
human actions have both advantages and

10:16.130 --> 10:26.408
disadvantages and have risks associated with 
them. And the problem of decision is to make your

10:26.428 --> 10:31.918
decision so as... In some sense, to maximize the 
advantages, minimize the disadvantages, and in

10:32.557 --> 10:41.587
particular, to minimize catastrophes. But you 
are going to reduce these things to zero. I think

10:44.810 --> 10:50.877
the ecological lobby generally is not living in 
the real world. That's to say, they assume that you

10:51.718 --> 10:58.285
can have certainty in human affairs. I was talking 
about this recently in Santa Barbara. And I was

11:02.206 --> 11:10.517
talking about bouncing one thing against another 
and so on, and someone got up and asked, but what is

11:02.206 --> 11:10.517
your long-term policy? It's not tolerable to go on 
like this. And I said, well, actually, you know,

11:15.023 --> 11:19.349
life is riding a bicycle on a tightrope. It's not 
driving a tricycle on a road. That's to say... You

11:25.662 --> 11:32.392
keep your equilibrium and keep things going, not 
by the nature of the system, but by continual

11:25.662 --> 11:32.392
adjustments. It's an interaction between what 
happens and the thing you're doing, which is

11:32.592 --> 11:38.440
important. And I think the people who argue 
against any sort of technological developments

11:38.741 --> 11:50.438
feel that they ought to be riding a tricycle. That 
the things they're doing ought to have the

11:50.458 --> 11:54.083
automatic safety from from tipping over of the 
third wheel. You shouldn't have to avoid

11:58.197 --> 12:05.203
catastrophes by continual adjustment. But I 
think the nature of the world and the nature of

12:05.223 --> 12:23.580
society is that, in fact, it is a cybernetic system 
in which you have to adjust the progress as you go

12:05.223 --> 12:23.580
along in order to steer yourself between the 
different kinds of disasters. And, well, now, if

12:24.370 --> 12:32.883
you apply this to nuclear power stations, 
obviously, you can, nuclear power stations are

12:24.370 --> 12:32.883
dangerous. If a nuclear power station falls to 
pieces, large amounts of radioactivity will be

12:33.964 --> 12:42.337
emitted, and there will be a catastrophe. A 
meaning by catastrophe is something in which more

12:42.357 --> 12:45.742
than a few hundred people are killed. I mean, a 
thing in which a hundred people are killed is not a

12:46.323 --> 12:48.927
catastrophe. Catastrophe is a thing that society 
doesn't want to accept. I mean, they'll accept

12:52.178 --> 12:55.482
accidents to jumbo jets. I landed in New York in the 
middle of a lot of fire engines the other day

12:55.602 --> 13:01.029
because a jumbo jet had lost one engine. Well, 
society accepts this kind of thing, but they'll

13:01.569 --> 13:10.099
accept very large numbers of deaths which are not 
obvious. They will, for instance, accept in the

13:10.840 --> 13:18.289
last of the big London fogs, the deaths from 
respiratory disease by 2,000 over this short

13:19.670 --> 13:21.752
period. So in a sense, the London Fog killed 2,000 
people, which can't identify the people. And many

13:28.700 --> 13:31.643
of them would probably have died anyway in the 
succeeding weeks. So no one worried much. But the

13:35.347 --> 13:40.733
fogs were so unpleasant, and particularly this 
last one was so unpleasant, that they did, in fact,

13:35.347 --> 13:40.733
do something about it. And they have now got rid of 
the London Fogs by control of the burning of coal.

13:46.099 --> 13:49.423
Well, the For easily understandable historical 
reasons, the danger of accidents to nuclear

13:50.416 --> 14:04.698
plants, even quite remote ones, are unacceptable 
at the moment. But people are not considering the

14:04.718 --> 14:09.626
alternative dangers. And, of course, one can 
argue empirically. There have been a lot of

14:12.130 --> 14:16.677
nuclear power stations banned, particularly in 
England has been getting something like 10 or 15%

14:16.927 --> 14:21.693
of its power from nuclear fuel for a good many 
years. And in this country, there are all the

14:22.414 --> 14:25.878
weapons reactors.

14:28.361 --> 14:29.602
Been here for 30 years or so. And no one has yet been 
killed by them, as far as one knows. There have been

14:37.752 --> 14:38.694
accidents. The most serious accident, I suppose, 
was the Canadian accident at Chalk River just

14:38.714 --> 14:44.841
after the war. There were some cows who started 
giving radioactive milk after an accident in

14:45.158 --> 14:52.487
England and the milk had to be poured down the drain 
and there was a great scene about this. There have

14:53.408 --> 15:01.778
been minor accidents which are a warning that if 
you don't take the proper precautions there may be

14:53.408 --> 15:01.778
more serious accidents. But I think the 
alternatives seem to me less desirable. quite

15:09.914 --> 15:16.742
disturbed about the big coal power plants in Utah, 
which are in the middle of some of the finest

15:09.914 --> 15:16.742
scenery in the United States. And I don't know in 
detail about them, but is it really acceptable to

15:17.904 --> 15:27.195
have all this smoke and stuff on the outside in the 
air over southern Utah? The inhabitants of Utah

15:27.836 --> 15:32.021
don't mind because they don't live there. And the 
inhabitants of California, I think, do mind to

15:32.222 --> 15:37.508
some extent because this is one of their holiday 
areas. The obvious thing to do is to put the coal

15:38.197 --> 15:42.161
power stations in Mexico. Yeah. But you can't say 
this. Well, so my feeling is that the risks of

15:44.123 --> 15:51.671
operation of nuclear power stations can be 
contained. It's important, of course, not to have

15:51.711 --> 16:00.379
the AC or whatever it's called now, both judge and 
jury. That I think there must be a regulatory

16:01.060 --> 16:07.967
agency who isn't responsible actually for 
running them as well.

16:10.968 --> 16:18.139
that you can avoid having accidents with nuclear 
power stations with a frequency which matters to

16:10.968 --> 16:18.139
anyone. I mean, once you get up to one accident in 
100,000 years, well, I don't much mind if it

16:18.159 --> 16:23.288
occurs. I mean, it's a negligible thing. It's, you 
know, a tenth of a person per year or something of

16:25.511 --> 16:29.077
this sort. Of course, every human activity kills 
people. I mean, people fall off scaffolding. And

16:35.555 --> 16:37.657
building buildings is extremely dangerous. I 
mean, building nuclear power stations is much

16:37.838 --> 16:41.081
more dangerous than operating them. I think more 
people are likely to be killed by falling off the

16:41.482 --> 16:47.228
scaffolding than by escape of radioactivity. The 
one that does worry me is the disposal of waste. And

16:52.274 --> 16:55.898
I'm about to attempt to write a report on this. I 
haven't got around to it at all yet. But it looks as

16:58.301 --> 17:03.807
if someone's going to pay me for writing a report on 
it. I think it's a serious problem, but I suspect

17:04.360 --> 17:09.168
not an insoluble one. I don't really know enough 
about it at this point to give an opinion. It might

17:13.135 --> 17:24.034
turn out that it's really very undesirable and is 
fatal to the nuclear power program, but I imagine

17:13.135 --> 17:24.034
that satisfactory solutions can be found. I mean, 
what I want to do is to read up on the whole subject.

17:28.162 --> 17:29.524
Sir, I have a question. I'd like to interject a 
personal question, if I may. Are you, as a

17:32.586 --> 17:40.416
scientist, offended by comments of other people, 
like the oceans are dying, for example, or soon the

17:32.586 --> 17:40.416
Red Sea will be gone? I'm irritated by them because 
of the... I don't believe that in order to support

17:46.004 --> 17:57.098
what you emotionally believe to be a good cause, 
you should tell what you know to be lies. And

17:58.259 --> 18:11.560
clearly, Mr. Nader, and I won't say Mr. Nader, I'm 
not going to say anyone personally, but there

17:58.259 --> 18:11.560
clearly are people around, I specifically 
exclude Mr. Nader, there are people around who are

18:12.535 --> 18:19.502
telling lies which they know to be lies, and there 
are a great many others who are telling lies which

18:12.535 --> 18:19.502
they haven't taken the trouble to find that 
they're lies. Okay, now the point of this question

18:19.942 --> 18:38.720
is, is when a man of your eminence and ability 
writes a report on nuclear waste, and suppose the

18:19.942 --> 18:38.720
report suggests that nuclear waste disposal with 
a minimum risk is possible, shouldn't there not be

18:19.942 --> 18:38.720
some way for scientists to publicize this to the 
general public? Well, there's a great deal of, I

18:39.000 --> 18:42.103
mean, there is a great deal of publicity on this 
subject. I mean, if I should write a report to the

18:44.123 --> 18:58.397
people who are paying me, their interest is, their 
ultimate interest is, is there a field in which

18:44.123 --> 18:58.397
they could make a useful contribution? I mean, can 
we, we're trying to think of a program of work on

18:58.437 --> 19:07.966
disposal of nuclear waste which is useful and 
which, of course, can be paid for. And one of the

19:08.807 --> 19:11.770
things we are starting to do is simply to write as 
objective a report as possible on what the risks

19:12.020 --> 19:20.474
are in the different possible schemes. I mean, it 
involves things like, are the extrapolations in

19:22.257 --> 19:30.692
the number of nuclear power stations in any sense 
realistic? I mean, the trouble is that many of the

19:30.712 --> 19:38.044
projections in the nuclear power industry 
involve such a very rapid increase. that you are

19:38.412 --> 19:44.941
allowed to get into trouble because there is a 
limit to the rate at which you can safely grow.

19:45.482 --> 19:50.649
Because you see, as I say, the thing is a steering 
problem of adjusting yourself as you go along. If

19:50.769 --> 19:56.417
you're a crash programmer, you're extremely 
allowed to get yourself in a dangerous situation

19:50.769 --> 19:56.417
before you notice it. I mean, there is a certain 
deliberate haste, as I think the political phase

19:56.958 --> 20:02.505
usually is, is desirable. You mustn't go madly 
into things which may actually prove dangerous

20:06.087 --> 20:30.677
you've got to go into them rather slowly and see 
what happens it's like the question of the ozone

20:06.087 --> 20:30.677
you see as far as i know no one really knows what 
anything you do will do to the ozone layer i mean

20:06.087 --> 20:30.677
will the present production of these spray 
compounds do anything to the ozone layer well i

20:06.087 --> 20:30.677
don't think anyone could put their hand on their 
hearts and say they were certain But what is

20:31.282 --> 20:33.806
certain is that the effect is quite slow. Because 
after all, we've been using these bloody cans for

20:33.826 --> 20:38.052
years and years and years, and not much has 
happened. And the ozone layer fluctuates 50%

20:38.473 --> 20:41.037
anyway. And what you've got to do is to monitor it 
and keep an eye on it. And at some point, you may

20:45.944 --> 20:48.428
decide certain things are dangerous. But you 
don't need, just because there's a possibility of

20:48.468 --> 20:59.905
something wrong, to go into a lot of legislation 
and a lot of inconvenience very rapidly. But this

21:00.256 --> 21:06.081
is because the use of these things is not going to 
increase enormously rapidly. If we were going to

21:06.121 --> 21:10.645
have 10 times as many used every year, then clearly 
it would be dangerous. But if you're going along at

21:10.685 --> 21:14.969
about the present level, slowly increasing, 
you'll keep an eye on it. So I think there's a great

21:15.529 --> 21:21.014
deal to be said in these dangerous situations of 
deliberate haste. Let's say making haste rather

21:21.955 --> 21:23.556
slowly. Now, I have one more question. Looking 
back and reading about your career, You almost

21:30.361 --> 21:40.635
typify, well, you excel actually, in the kind of 
scientist who's able to mix together academic,

21:30.361 --> 21:40.635
military, and business worlds. Was this 
deliberate in your career? I've always had this

21:44.260 --> 21:51.570
feeling on the one side that what I like doing is 
science and what I ought to do is science. And then I

21:51.590 --> 21:55.575
become interested in other things and I've gone 
off and and done them, and finally I began to

21:55.876 --> 22:01.304
realize that I had the two sides to my character. I 
like doing both. And in fact, I've leant away from

22:03.568 --> 22:10.238
science in the latter part of my career. I haven't 
really done much science for the last ten years. I

22:14.585 --> 22:19.953
mean, I've had a very good group in Cambridge, and 
I've encouraged them, and I've spent a lot of time

22:14.585 --> 22:19.953
talking to them. But personally, I haven't done 
much. I mean, what I can do still is talk to people

22:24.327 --> 22:26.830
and suggest what they would do. But I usually 
decide it's really too much of a business to do it

22:27.490 --> 22:31.595
myself. And I think also science is to some extent a 
young man's game. I mean, I've not got the

22:36.881 --> 22:47.712
originality and the power of going out and 
starting new things now as I get older. I mean,

22:48.153 --> 22:50.115
after all, I feel I'm going to die before long. 
There's no good starting very long-term

22:50.135 --> 22:52.157
projects. I mean, like when I started 
investigating the floor of the ocean, it would be

22:52.795 --> 23:03.849
silly to do something, start something like that 
again at my age, you see. I think it's partly, this

23:03.869 --> 23:12.100
is partly, you know, a background and class thing. 
I know it's a very unfashionable thing to say, but I

23:12.120 --> 23:21.672
think you come from a well-off background where 
there's not been a tremendous struggle. then you

23:22.478 --> 23:34.452
easily get a self-confidence and a feeling you can 
do things, feeling you're the man who knows about

23:22.478 --> 23:34.452
it and ought to make good choices. And you can, in 
fact, chase around people from other backgrounds

23:35.172 --> 23:39.257
and get what you want. I mean, like these poor chaps 
who were in charge of demagnetizing ships during

23:41.339 --> 23:47.947
the war, and they just didn't know what had hit 
them. They were out before they knew what was

23:48.087 --> 23:50.830
happening. They didn't know any of the right 
people They didn't know how to behave. They

23:55.347 --> 23:59.052
wouldn't behave as badly as I was willing to 
behave. I mean, I've at various times been willing

23:59.873 --> 24:06.142
to behave pretty badly.

24:06.502 --> 24:13.032
And a certain feeling about the value of money, an 
objective feeling about money. You see, people

24:13.092 --> 24:21.023
ordinarily have a realistic feeling about sums of 
money they normally spend themselves. Parkinson

24:21.183 --> 24:22.405
pointed out. that you will always, on a board of 
directors, get a vigorous discussion about

24:22.756 --> 24:28.124
building a bicycle shed. But if you have a 
discussion about building a nuclear-powered

24:28.144 --> 24:37.056
aircraft, no one will know anything about it, and 
you'll get hardly any discussion at all. And this

24:37.277 --> 24:47.531
is very true, that people have got realistic ideas 
about money they've been used to hearing talked

24:37.277 --> 24:47.531
about. I mean, if you've always known fairly rich 
people, and if you've always moved in Circles

24:52.034 --> 24:58.546
where people are directors of companies and high 
officials and governments and so on. You're used

24:58.566 --> 25:01.711
to talking about large sums of money. And so that 
you start with an advantage against people

25:01.731 --> 25:07.822
brought up in different backgrounds. This sounds 
rather unfair and extremely unfashionable. And

25:13.032 --> 25:16.438
of course it's clearly extremely inequitable, 
but that's how things work.
