WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:06.234
My name is Dominic Mankit Lamb. You can get the 
spelling later, right? And I hold a number of

00:08.857 --> 00:12.342
positions. Most of them are in the Woodlands. I'm 
the founding director of the Center for

00:15.246 --> 00:25.479
Biotechnology at Baylor College of Medicine, 
which is located in the Woodlands. It's founded in

00:25.499 --> 00:30.966
1985 and

00:33.241 --> 00:44.780
And the building was completed in 1987 on an 11 acre 
of land donated to Baylor by George Mitchell. I'm

00:47.284 --> 00:55.637
also professor of biotechnology, cell biology, 
and ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine.

01:00.764 --> 01:27.496
Additionally, in 1984, I

01:00.764 --> 01:27.496
co-founded Houston Biotechnology 
Incorporated,

01:00.764 --> 01:27.496
which is a company based on an invention that a 
colleague of mine, Dr. Jared Emery, and I

01:00.764 --> 01:27.496
discovered when we were professors at Baylor. And 
on the basis of that discovery, a company was

01:31.021 --> 01:40.750
founded, started by Baylor in Houston, and in 1986 
we moved up to the Woodlands. And what was the

01:42.011 --> 01:44.013
nature of the discovery? Could you describe it a 
bit? Yeah, I will talk about each operation

01:45.995 --> 01:49.898
because otherwise it's very confusing. And then

01:50.559 --> 01:59.627
in 1989,

01:59.911 --> 02:28.888
I also founded another company based on Baylor's, 
another technology that I developed while at

01:59.911 --> 02:28.888
Baylor College of Medicine, and that company is 
called GES Pharmaceutical, for genetic engineer

01:59.911 --> 02:28.888
systems, Pharmaceuticals Inc. That company is 
also located in the Woodlands, and I'm a director

01:59.911 --> 02:28.888
of that company.

02:29.122 --> 02:40.124
A little bit of the background, I was born in 
mainland China, but moved to- my whole family

02:29.122 --> 02:40.124
emigrated to Hong Kong when I was four months old, 
and I grew up in Hong Kong. At sixteen I went to

02:40.785 --> 02:51.366
college in Canada, first in mathematics, and then 
I did a master's

02:52.055 --> 03:01.973
theoretical physics before I became interested 
in medicine and

02:52.055 --> 03:01.973
especially in pharma research. So I did my 
doctorate at University of Toronto and then upon

03:02.654 --> 03:13.995
finishing that I went to Harvard Medical School 
where I worked with two professors there, Dr. and

03:14.617 --> 03:24.449
Dr. David Hubel, who later on in 1981 received the 
Nobel Prize in medicine. I stayed on at Harvard

03:25.730 --> 03:32.979
until 1977 as an assistant professor at Harvard. 
In 1977, I moved to Baylor College of Medicine to

03:33.520 --> 03:44.573
head a program in their ophthalmology 
department. It was in that environment that I

03:46.493 --> 04:04.260
discovered with my colleagues in 1984 a treatment 
for secondary cataract, or more accurately, a

03:46.493 --> 04:04.260
preventive for secondary cataract. And this is 
based on a new technology called hybridoma

04:05.361 --> 04:15.336
technology, which is the production of 
monoclonal antibodies. in vitro. Using that

04:17.682 --> 04:32.260
technology, we found that we can produce 
antibodies when they are coupled to certain types

04:17.682 --> 04:32.260
of toxins would destroy the cells that cause 
secondary cataract. Now very briefly, what is

04:33.101 --> 04:35.364
secondary cataract? Secondary, we all know what 
primary cataract is. Primary cataract is the is

04:42.586 --> 05:11.175
when the length of the eye becomes clouded because 
the cells started to die then that obstructs the

04:42.586 --> 05:11.175
passage of light between the outside world and the 
back of the eye which is the retina when that

04:42.586 --> 05:11.175
happened then normally the patient would go to the 
ophthalmologist which who, in a half an hour

05:11.510 --> 05:19.902
operation, would remove the lens and sometimes 
put in the artificial lens. Yeah, my mother had

05:20.182 --> 05:21.685
that done. She has 20-20 vision now. It's 
incredible. It's the most popular surgical

05:25.470 --> 05:36.025
procedure in the United States, accounting for 
about 1.2 million cases a year in the United States

05:25.470 --> 05:36.025
alone. And it works extremely well most of the 
time. There's only one major complication with

05:41.463 --> 05:49.797
the procedure, which is called extracapsular 
extraction.

05:52.942 --> 06:01.497
And that complication has to do that the surgeon 
rarely can remove all the cells that cause

05:52.942 --> 06:01.497
cataract. So there are always a few cells left. 
that then try to form another lens and they don't

06:04.801 --> 06:34.099
form it successfully so again they instead of 
forming a transparent lens they form what is like a

06:04.801 --> 06:34.099
frosted lens so that light again is obstructed 
from or images are obstructed at that place and in

06:04.801 --> 06:34.099
1984 i thought that if one could have a medicine 
such as a very specific antibody which at the end of

06:34.872 --> 06:55.802
the surgery could be injected into the eye to 
destroy all the cells that could not be, the

06:34.872 --> 06:55.802
minuscule amount of cells that could not be 
destroyed by, could not be removed by surgery.

06:56.222 --> 07:00.829
That would clear the problem and this was what we 
did. This product is now going into clinical

07:00.961 --> 07:27.745
trials, and

07:00.961 --> 07:27.745
we expect it to have a market in the United States 
alone of hundreds of millions of dollars, because

07:00.961 --> 07:27.745
it will be used in about a million patients a year, 
and if one charges a couple hundred dollars,

07:00.961 --> 07:27.745
that's already 200 million dollars. How long is 
the processing period? What? How long will the

07:32.004 --> 07:34.868
test period be before you can release it? Oh, 
probably another few years before we finish the

07:35.048 --> 07:42.076
testing, clinical testing. This is a brochure 
about Houston Biotechnology, which is outdated.

07:46.501 --> 07:54.711
It's two years old, but it gives you some idea of 
what has happened and how we raise money and so on.

07:55.111 --> 07:56.533
I'm also... Now, in 1985, when we were finding, 
trying to find a permanent place to locate Houston

07:56.986 --> 08:17.649
Biotechnology,

07:56.986 --> 08:17.649
we were asked to look at the Woodlands by Mr. Mike 
Richmond and Dr. Gottlieb, David Gottlieb. And we

08:18.229 --> 08:26.098
decided that, especially because of the vision of 
Mr. Mitchell and also the natural beauty of the

08:26.433 --> 08:37.669
woodlands as a living, as a community in which to 
live, that this would be a desirable place to move.

08:38.250 --> 08:45.421
There's only one hitch that's a problem is that at 
that time there was not even research forest road.

08:45.561 --> 08:52.331
There was no high tech research or industry here at 
all. And we felt that For high tech industry, one

08:54.479 --> 09:03.608
must have a significant amount of intellectual 
interactions and activities here. And so Mr.

09:04.229 --> 09:22.528
Mitchell, in particular, convinced Baylor 
College of Medicine that as a community leader,

09:04.229 --> 09:22.528
that maybe they would build a center for 
biotechnology out in the woodlands around which

09:04.229 --> 09:22.528
new biotechnology companies can flourish. can be 
established and flourish. Did you know this was

09:24.691 --> 09:28.938
happening before you made the decision to move? 
What was happening? Oh yeah, both moved at the same

09:29.899 --> 09:32.102
time. The decision was made at the same time, that 
if Baylor would do that, I would move up here and

09:32.643 --> 09:41.337
build the first company, biotech company. And 
that was all agreed upon in 1985. after which we

09:46.707 --> 09:51.115
raised $26 million for Houston Biotechnology. 
Did Mitchell's organization help you in that? In

09:55.905 --> 09:56.606
raising the money? In raising capital? No, not as 
much in raising $26 million. They put in some money

10:01.235 --> 10:04.581
in the earlier round. as venture capital money. 
But the major amount of money was raised by Sherson

10:08.241 --> 10:16.512
Lehman Hutton in a public offering of R&D 
partnership.

10:18.354 --> 10:33.454
So

10:18.354 --> 10:33.454
while I remain to this day as the chairman of 
Houston Biotechnology, I was also asked to be the

10:18.354 --> 10:33.454
founding director of the Center for 
Biotechnology. put up all the money for the

10:33.653 --> 10:52.618
building, and I was responsible for hiring the 
people into the center, which now has about maybe

10:33.653 --> 10:52.618
80 or so full-time members now in the three years 
that we are here. That's a lot of development. And

10:56.143 --> 11:02.631
now one reason that Baylor agreed to do this was 
that, as you remember, when the energy

11:03.100 --> 11:22.959
prices took a dive in 1983 or so, Houston suddenly 
woke up to the fact that you could not live on a

11:03.100 --> 11:22.959
single industry, namely the energy industry, 
that you had to diversify. So the city attempted to

11:28.987 --> 11:32.871
than to see what are the industries that Houston 
can diversify into. One area is obviously in space

11:33.291 --> 11:52.670
because of the NASA, another area is in shipping 
because of the port, and then another area is in

11:33.291 --> 11:52.670
petrochemical again because of energy related. 
But a very important area that suddenly became

11:56.560 --> 12:14.926
commercially very attractive is the 
biopharmaceutical area, because the Texas

11:56.560 --> 12:14.926
Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical 
center in the world, in United States anyway,

11:56.560 --> 12:14.926
maybe in the world, it's hard to know. However, 
that has always flourished as almost a

12:15.366 --> 12:20.273
pharentropic activity. When people make a lot of 
money, like Collins and Jones, they donate the

12:20.590 --> 12:31.762
money, but nobody has ever tried to commercialize 
the research and medical products that come out of

12:20.590 --> 12:31.762
that. So Houston Biotechnology was, in a way, the 
first one that formalized the beginning of this

12:31.782 --> 12:50.243
biopharmaceutical

12:31.782 --> 12:50.243
commercialization effort, spearheaded by the 
medical center. decided that the medical center

12:50.459 --> 12:58.610
area is really too congested to sustain the 
long-term industry. And therefore, the

12:59.631 --> 13:14.070
Woodlands, because of Mr. Mitchell and because 
his location, was chosen by us to be the place where

12:59.631 --> 13:14.070
hopefully the biopharmaceutical industry in 
Houston would flourish. What have been your

13:15.653 --> 13:19.220
relations to the Houston Medical Center itself? 
Well, I'm still a full professor with Baylor

13:19.500 --> 13:25.452
College of Medicine. And I still go down to 
committee meetings and so on. I'm still a chairman

13:28.618 --> 13:30.762
of the department. But it's just that it's up here. 
So the relationship, though, is basically still

13:34.570 --> 13:47.442
cordial and very close, and you would expect it to 
be... Oh, the relationship is very good, and in

13:34.570 --> 13:47.442
fact, Baylor is responsible for all the operating 
expenses up here. It's a full-fledged center

13:48.183 --> 13:52.767
owned by Baylor. No, this particular building is 
Houston Biotechnology. This is the commercial

13:55.910 --> 13:57.711
side. At 30,000 square feet, this is for the 
commercialization of biotechnology. of forming

14:03.140 --> 14:04.373
products. On the other side is better culture 
medicine. Yeah, they're two separate,

14:07.190 --> 14:12.879
physically and financially and 
administratively distinct. So this is happening

14:13.480 --> 14:19.949
with the blessing of the Houston Medical Center 
and the downtown community, the Texas Medical

14:13.480 --> 14:19.949
Center. And with Baylor College of Medicine. 
Yeah. Yeah, explicitly. Yes, that's right. And

14:24.236 --> 14:30.004
subsequent to us, as you know, University of Texas 
has built a cryobiology center here. Yeah, we saw

14:30.025 --> 14:30.766
that. And Life Cell is here, another company. 
started by University of Texas. F.D. Anderson has

14:37.975 --> 14:41.579
founded a company called Argus that has moved up 
here now. Okay, and the incentive for those moves

14:41.839 --> 14:45.583
has come primarily from what threw us through? 
Through the woodlands or through yourself? Well,

14:47.665 --> 14:48.806
it's probably both. You know, as you know, most 
people don't like to take the lead. And, you know,

14:53.511 --> 14:56.855
when we first came here, the road has to be built. 
There was no road. The forest, we have to... to

15:01.983 --> 15:04.107
bring in sewage and telephone lines. This is the 
first building in the research forest, right

15:04.127 --> 15:08.516
here. And so, once I was willing with my colleagues 
to build these first two buildings, it was much

15:09.177 --> 15:24.767
easier to attract other companies and 
institutions to come up. Now are these your

15:25.270 --> 15:28.213
buildings, may I ask, or are they the Woodlands? 
Well, this building is owned by the Woodlands, but

15:28.414 --> 15:32.939
we lease. That building is owned by Baylor.

15:40.447 --> 15:43.631
Did Mr. Mitchell donate the land for that 
building? Yes, for Baylor's. And they own this

15:44.852 --> 15:47.956
one? They own this one,

15:48.016 --> 15:53.202
then we lease. Does your company now have any 
direct involvement or relationships to the other

15:53.688 --> 16:02.003
medical companies and industries that are 
developing around you? Yes. For example, GES

16:02.324 --> 16:05.930
Pharmaceutical, which I founded last year. Now, 
Houston Biotechnology exclusively, yes, is

16:06.552 --> 16:14.987
specifically developing drugs against eye 
diseases. GES, which I founded last year, is to

16:15.524 --> 16:25.820
develop drugs against other kinds of diseases, 
such as neurological and cardiovascular

16:15.524 --> 16:25.820
diseases. And then the Center for Biotechnology 
has founded another company last year called

16:25.840 --> 16:35.716
Triplex Pharmaceutical Corporation, 
T-R-I-P-L-E-X. And that one is, you know, to use a

16:35.736 --> 16:42.126
new kind of therapy to treat diseases. So we are We 
are beginning to establish a large number of

16:43.334 --> 16:47.081
companies. We also work with HAAC on different 
projects. We collaborated on a project with using

16:50.729 --> 17:01.410
laser to sculpture the cornea to correct 
nearsightedness and farsightedness. So you

17:02.437 --> 17:09.566
really see a sort of a complementary, symbiotic 
medical community or something developing in

17:02.437 --> 17:09.566
this area? Yes, biomedical community. That has a 
great deal of promise. I think Baylor College of

17:11.708 --> 17:23.483
Medicine is a national leader in this, a leader in 
having academia and industry work side by side

17:11.708 --> 17:23.483
each other, as you know. At A&M, there has been a lot 
of difficulty trying to commercialize A&M's

17:23.935 --> 17:29.942
products. But Baylor really has been a pioneer. 
And universities from Stanford to Harvard come

17:32.725 --> 17:40.795
here to see how this is done. Oh, which are private 
institutions. Is that the distinction, the fact

17:42.256 --> 17:48.143
that A&M, for example, is a state-supported 
institution, whereas Baylor and Harvard? Yes,

17:48.163 --> 17:49.445
that's partly true. But of course, Harvard, 
Rockefeller, and Stanford are also private.

17:53.922 --> 17:54.402
Right. And they also have problem with dealing 
with between academia and industry. Yeah. Being

18:01.609 --> 18:03.811
private, it makes it more flexible. But it's not 
the only reason, difficulty with

18:04.512 --> 18:17.363
commercialization of one's technologies.

18:17.483 --> 18:21.567
Do you have any future directions now that you're 
heading your company or your two companies? Yes,

18:24.623 --> 18:26.985
we do. Our goal is to make the Baylor Center for 
Biotechnology one of the leading biotech centers

18:27.005 --> 18:38.337
in the country in research efforts. And in that 
regard, we have already attracted a number of

18:38.438 --> 18:49.950
first-rate scientists, so we are making the right 
first step in that. The other companies that I

18:50.302 --> 18:58.174
found, obviously, the priority is to have our 
first product in the market. Now, GES

18:58.194 --> 19:04.763
Pharmaceutical already has products for 
screening drugs that are available. Some of those

19:06.045 --> 19:15.559
will be licensed to US and Japanese companies and 
European companies. But Houston Biotechnology,

19:18.787 --> 19:22.631
is developing therapeutic agents, which take a 
long time. And we have built what we believe is the

19:23.352 --> 19:40.849
first FDA-approved GMP drug manufacturing 
facilities in Houston for biological materials,

19:23.352 --> 19:40.849
like proteins here in Houston. And that takes a 
long time, and we have to go through the regulatory

19:40.869 --> 19:47.376
affairs in getting drugs approved. But 
hopefully, within the next five years, one can see

19:47.356 --> 19:56.007
a number of important products that will emerge 
from the woodlands. Not just from our company, but

19:56.027 --> 19:59.631
other companies as well. This effort with HARC, is 
it similar? The effort with HARC is mostly a

20:02.034 --> 20:04.798
research effort. It has not been a conventional 
effort. Again, HARC is a non-profit

20:08.803 --> 20:14.410
organization.

20:14.845 --> 20:22.493
But I think in the future we'll have some 
commercial

20:14.845 --> 20:22.493
efforts. What do you see as the dynamics of the 
woodlands now in terms of its development? How is

20:28.219 --> 20:32.324
this going to affect the development of the 
woodlands and the Houston society generally? How

20:33.104 --> 20:35.447
does this fit, say, the research part? Well, I 
think the woodlands is already, it certainly lags

20:35.567 --> 20:44.076
behind the research triangle part. Yeah, that's a 
pattern we've heard mentioned a lot. In North

20:46.401 --> 20:50.166
Carolina and also the Silicon Valley area. You see 
something like that happening here, though?

20:52.189 --> 20:59.139
Yeah, there's no question that we see something 
like that around here, especially with respect to

20:52.189 --> 20:59.139
biotechnology. Now, it's unlikely to happen in 
microelectronics or telecommunication or

20:59.319 --> 21:09.193
computers because we're too far behind to really 
catch up on that. The last chance we had was

21:09.213 --> 21:11.096
compact. It didn't move here. they didn't move 
here but anyway um however in biotechnology where

21:12.828 --> 21:41.080
the field is still very in this infant stage that i 
think that the woodlands we are trying to build the

21:12.828 --> 21:41.080
woodlands as the gulf coast equivalent to the east 
coast and west coast establishment so we want to

21:12.828 --> 21:41.080
establish this as the third coast for 
biotechnology biopharmaceutical Your home is in

21:41.853 --> 21:43.575
the woodlands? Yes, I live five minutes from here. 
Do you find the environment itself an attractive

21:48.983 --> 21:54.871
recruiting mechanism to bring people in? Well, 
you know, other than having the privilege and

21:54.891 --> 22:10.572
pleasure of working with Mrs. Mitchell, the major 
reason why I moved here, and also many of my

21:54.891 --> 22:10.572
colleagues, is because the woodlands is such a 
great area to live in and to raise a family. I have

22:11.941 --> 22:15.487
two children and they go to the very good public 
schools. I think we're still an infant in terms of

22:15.567 --> 22:25.022
the number of intellectual powers over here. 
We're new. However, it's an environment where

22:27.206 --> 22:33.055
people can live

22:35.144 --> 22:44.478
among the woods and in a place that's safe, that's 
still affordable, I would think that we're second

22:35.144 --> 22:44.478
to none in the nation. And I think that's a major 
strength that will help us continue to recruit the

22:45.159 --> 22:54.573
top-notch people to December. Not only as not only 
famous and established people, but as much as more

23:01.604 --> 23:05.168
the brilliant young people. Because most of those 
people can't afford to buy a house in California.

23:10.234 --> 23:11.735
That's right. They want to have a family. So I think 
this is a major strength. And as you know, they're

23:17.321 --> 23:25.030
over, they're probably close to 200 PhD and MD 
doctorate-level people in the woodlands. Which

23:29.323 --> 23:31.867
is an unusual concentration in this part of the 
country. And it's still, while it's small, it's a

23:31.967 --> 23:41.319
very good nucleus on which to build our strength 
for the future. So I'm very optimistic about the

23:41.399 --> 23:44.142
future. I'm enthusiastic about building the 
woodlands. Good. That's probably a good place to

23:49.930 --> 23:51.071
stop. Okay. Thank you.
