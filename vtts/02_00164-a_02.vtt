WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:22.166
If

00:03.052 --> 00:22.166
somebody handed you a check for a million dollars 
and it had one restriction on it, you must pass it on

00:03.052 --> 00:22.166
to Texas A&M, but you can decide what you want A&M to 
do with it. If you could give A&M a million dollars,

00:22.887 --> 00:27.355
what would you tell them to do with your gift? Well, 
I'm afraid it wouldn't go to education. It would go

00:31.811 --> 00:40.453
to the activities programs of the Corps because I 
still believe that the Corps is a good education.

00:40.533 --> 00:42.779
What activities would you have? What money I do 
give mostly goes to the capital. Okay. And I'm sure

00:46.805 --> 01:07.247
you can understand why, because, but I do belong to 
a number of other things, you know, but I jointly

00:46.805 --> 01:07.247
have a scholarship, a presidential scholarship 
and a core scholarship and that sort of stuff, but

00:46.805 --> 01:07.247
those things are going to come along anyway. But 
the million dollars to me was going to make sure

01:12.003 --> 01:15.087
that they have these things to keep attracting 
them into the Corps. And if it's scholarships, it

01:15.187 --> 01:17.771
does it great, and I'm sure it is. To what former 
faculty, students, staff, whatever, to what

01:20.234 --> 01:34.593
people connected with A&M do you feel the most 
grateful for what they meant to you and why? Well, I

01:36.135 --> 01:41.402
think I've already told you what Dr. Harrington 
meant to me. I had one of my military instructors,

01:42.007 --> 01:47.836
it was then Captain Roy Smith. He was an Aggie, but I 
didn't know anything else about him. I was very

01:51.321 --> 01:53.004
patient and helpful. So you kind of looked up to 
those guys. I mentioned Majalis, that was my XO, my

01:55.688 --> 02:03.179
battery. You kind of, you know, sometimes you want 
to talk to an older guy about what should I do about

02:04.901 --> 02:10.630
this out of the other. And if you'll turn this 
machine off there. What have we not covered about

02:21.080 --> 02:24.247
your student years that we should have? Oh, I don't 
think there's a whole lot. I wrote down some

02:26.271 --> 02:27.273
things. Let me look real quick.

02:38.335 --> 02:49.529
The

02:38.335 --> 02:49.529
class of 49, you know, had three different 
starting classes, and then they, what we call,

02:38.335 --> 02:49.529
souped us up, gave us privileges ahead of time. So 
we ended up wearing our boots senior year when

02:49.929 --> 02:56.297
actually one academic semester we were juniors. 
So we had a semester of college left, and new

02:56.698 --> 03:01.444
seniors were coming in and taking command. So we 
still were under military contract and so forth,

03:02.045 --> 03:08.072
and they moved us into dorm one. And there were two 
floors of us and two companies. We still wore the

03:12.376 --> 03:13.817
uniform. We still had to march to Chow and do 
everything else the Corps had, except we didn't

03:13.877 --> 03:22.025
have to send more information. And we were kind of a 
maverick group. Nobody loved us anymore. So that

03:27.010 --> 03:34.738
was just another year of living in the dormitory, 
wearing the uniform, and not really belonging

03:27.010 --> 03:34.738
because we were all seniors. And you didn't have to 
worry with any of the, We had no, we just had a place

03:38.427 --> 03:42.092
to sleep and whatever. We didn't have to do the 
other stuff. In fact, they didn't want us to mess

03:43.835 --> 03:46.459
with them. There was a new group taking command. 
But I don't think there's probably been another

03:49.523 --> 03:52.107
one. Maybe there was somewhere in history. Okay, 
anything else? I was going to ask you a thing about

03:59.217 --> 04:01.540
this. Okay, the last question of this part. What 
feelings do you carry in your heart about Texas A&M

04:05.393 --> 04:11.280
now? How do you feel about A&M? Well, to me, next to 
my immediate family, it's the closest to my heart.

04:21.934 --> 04:27.461
Everywhere I go, I think, you know, I'm an Aggie, 
and I don't hesitate to let people know that. I

04:27.501 --> 04:33.949
think I have more stickers on my Lincoln than these 
guys have on their pickup trucks. I'm

04:34.756 --> 04:41.823
very sensitive to spotting ivies. And I'll tell 
you one little story. Just very recently, we go to

04:44.005 --> 04:52.594
Barksdale to the commissary, and I had on a t-shirt 
like this probably, because I wear them 98 times a

04:44.005 --> 04:52.594
time. And there was a handsome-looking black guy 
coming down there, a big old boy. I wouldn't fathom

04:59.961 --> 05:01.062
him. He had on a Texas ivy shirt. And so I went over to 
him and I said, I'm Tom Parsons, class of 49. He

05:07.609 --> 05:09.133
looked at me and, you're what? And shook hands with 
me. You're an Aggie, aren't you? I'm an Aggie. Oh,

05:16.129 --> 05:17.152
you mean this? And he said, I work for Goodwill and 
we're stocking groceries. good will to give me a

05:23.137 --> 05:25.340
shirt. So anyway, I don't hesitate to spot the 
Aggies and they do very close to me and just these

05:26.562 --> 05:45.530
gentlemen, I feel real good when I meet one of them 
and sometimes they even recognize my name. Not too

05:47.353 --> 05:48.975
long ago, Oh, three or four years ago, Grace and I 
were out at the cow barn one day and just wandering

05:49.613 --> 06:04.450
around, nobody there, and this kid walked up and I 
introduced myself and, are you related to Colonel

05:49.613 --> 06:04.450
Parsons? This is named after him? I said, yeah, 
that's me. And he said, oh, I thought he was dead. So

06:08.995 --> 06:11.858
I know they know me well out there. But I don't think 
my feelings are any different than 99% of the

06:12.766 --> 06:19.574
others. I just don't know. I've never heard 
anybody put A&M down that survived A&M. Maybe some

06:27.583 --> 06:33.049
put them down that didn't make it, but that was 
their own fault. Let's quit with that. Testing 1,

06:37.505 --> 06:39.949
2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Testing, testing, testing, 
testing. This is the second interview with

06:46.960 --> 06:50.265
Colonel Parsons. This is the 20th of September. 
We're in room 207. in the Evans Library and today we

06:56.320 --> 07:09.882
will be concentrating on his years here as 
Commandant and then as the Campus Security and

06:56.320 --> 07:09.882
Parking and Traffic. I didn't get that title 
exactly correct. Security and Traffic. Security

07:14.349 --> 07:16.152
and Traffic. To introduce this part of it, you were 
on active duty in the Army. How did you and A&M have

07:25.898 --> 07:32.009
any link about possibly coming here as 
commandant? Well, I was stationed at Fort Carson,

07:32.029 --> 07:42.848
Colorado, and at that time I was commanding the 4th 
Infantry Division Artillery, which had six

07:32.029 --> 07:42.848
battalions in it. I'd just about come to the end of 
my command tour time. I was within six months of

07:47.132 --> 07:50.436
going to be transferred anyway. And I heard about 
the job being opened and then I heard that Bon,

07:51.937 --> 08:00.386
Billy Bon, had been selected. Well, Billy screwed 
up and made general. He's a classmate of mine.

08:04.871 --> 08:10.337
Well, I heard through Billy that, hey, there's an 
opening down there. took leave and hopped on an

08:10.874 --> 08:15.041
airplane and flew down. I didn't tell anybody 
where I was going but my wife, because obviously my

08:15.061 --> 08:21.290
general and I didn't get along anyway. I was 
smarter than him and he didn't believe it. Anyway,

08:25.297 --> 08:30.064
I came down and

08:31.850 --> 08:33.533
I can't even think of his name now. General, Dean of 
Men. Hannigan? Dean Hannigan was in the chair. Of

08:39.726 --> 08:43.313
course, he understood military people pretty 
well. He took me around and talked to me for a long

08:44.796 --> 08:48.163
time. Anyway, Dr. Williams wasn't there at the 
time. And he said, no, you're going to have to come

08:53.399 --> 09:00.046
and visit Dr. Williams if we around here agree that 
you're the man. So I hopped on the plane and went

09:00.726 --> 09:03.709
back to Colorado. And I got another call from him. I 
flew back down. And Dr. Williams evidently was on

09:07.193 --> 09:12.578
some other mission at the time. So back I go. And 
meanwhile, it was summer camp time. And the cadets

09:18.604 --> 09:21.347
were at Fort Riley, Kansas. and Dr. Williams went 
to visit the cadets and I went over for an interview

09:21.715 --> 09:42.745
with him there and met the cadets that were the Army 
ones that were out there at the camp and everything

09:21.715 --> 09:42.745
went well and Dr. Williams

09:21.715 --> 09:42.745
said if you can get out of your command, you're the 
man for the job. That was not difficult. My general

09:45.240 --> 09:47.682
was more than happy to see me leave. We didn't see 
eye to eye on a few things. I headed out for A&M in the

09:52.508 --> 09:56.652
summer of 1971. When you talked to Dr. Williams, do 
you remember, what did he, did he ask you

09:57.653 --> 10:06.402
questions? He asked me personal questions. What 
seemed to be his concerns? Yes. Well, he was very

10:12.042 --> 10:16.368
interested in females. He was interested in Navy 
ROTC. He was interested in not so much my

10:22.176 --> 10:26.041
educational background. He didn't ask me much 
about my military background because Dean

10:26.061 --> 10:30.567
Hannigan had already found out. I mean, it's easy 
to find out that stuff. But mostly it was just kind

10:33.150 --> 10:35.193
of social. And then we went to the, they always have 
a party for the Aggies at these things, and we went

10:35.874 --> 10:40.660
to that. And, of course, I made it good with the 
cadets that were there because, you know, I fitted

10:41.095 --> 10:48.644
in pretty well with them, I guess. Describe your 
first impressions of Dr. Williams. Oh, I was a

10:54.030 --> 10:56.393
little frightened in a way. I mean, you know, he's 
the easy man to talk to, but after all, you know,

10:56.513 --> 11:02.720
he's the president and I'm the colonel or 
whatever. There's a big gap in that. And he was very

11:04.957 --> 11:06.479
polite to me. We had a couple of drinks and, you 
know, I guess he talked to me maybe 30 minutes. Did

11:13.527 --> 11:16.970
he at all mention his World War II military record? 
I didn't know at that time . And so you came then in?

11:23.918 --> 11:24.759
Summer of 71. Summer of 71. And he had come in 
November 1, 1970. Right. Colonel McCoy was the

11:32.345 --> 11:39.035
commandant then and he had already retired and 
they let him stay on active duty until I came in. So

11:39.616 --> 11:45.164
you then are signed as a U.S. Army Professor of 
Military Science. Yeah, but you were officially

11:45.184 --> 11:48.709
still a member of the Army. You weren't? Oh yeah. 
That's what I thought. Okay. Describe the core

11:51.329 --> 12:01.593
staff of the military and military science when 
you got here. Well, we were Army and Air Force, and

12:01.774 --> 12:09.793
of course I had the responsibility for the Army's 
ROTC program, and I had a lieutenant colonel who

12:10.212 --> 12:16.442
was my deputy, who in a sense ran the Air Force, the 
Army ROTC. The Air Force had a colonel, Crosland

12:16.462 --> 12:21.550
was his name, Bob Crosland. And from the ROTC point 
of view, we were separate, just like the

12:22.432 --> 12:29.503
difference between political science and 
engineering, I guess. But I had 18 officers and

12:30.108 --> 12:35.036
seven enlisted men. And the enlisted men, some of 
them were instructors because they were better

12:36.018 --> 12:40.765
qualified in a lot of areas. And we had four 
civilian employees, Department of the Army

12:40.845 --> 12:46.294
civilian employees. and one university employee 
there. So it was a fairly large operation. The Air

12:54.742 --> 13:00.127
Force was about the same in size and whatever. The 
Army had a few more cadets than the Air Force did.

13:07.655 --> 13:12.180
For the Commandant's Office, it was totally, in my 
opinion, understaffed. I had to pull Don Johnson

13:12.903 --> 13:25.499
out of the Army program and make him the deputy, and 
that's one of my Army people, and I'm already out of

13:12.903 --> 13:25.499
the flight. The Air Force provided me a major, and 
the rest of the people, which was one, two, five

13:25.519 --> 13:34.911
people in the office, and three male civilians who 
were so-called advisors to the Corps, one of whom

13:35.279 --> 13:41.169
was Malin. And they, of course, tried to keep track 
of, you know, problems in the dorms and this, that,

13:42.411 --> 13:51.165
and the other, and yell practices and so forth. And 
that was the size of the staff. About, of all of the

13:54.251 --> 14:00.561
staff, about how many of them were Aggies in their 
undergraduate training? Well, I'd say the Army

14:01.148 --> 14:10.084
ROTC officers were probably 75% and the Air Force 
more or less about the same percentage. Of course,

14:10.164 --> 14:13.530
Aggies were fighting to get the job. You didn't 
have to beg them to come to A&M. The problem was

14:17.637 --> 14:20.001
getting them to release them to come to A&M. 
Because an ROTC assignment is not the most

14:20.453 --> 14:24.917
productive for your career. Yeah, yeah. And I had 
had a previous ROTC assignment at Boston College.

14:30.722 --> 14:35.026
And so my career was, well, my career was okay. It 
didn't hurt my career, but it put you off track for a

14:35.046 --> 14:38.048
while. And the corps offices then were. They were 
all active duty. No, no, I'm sorry. The location of

14:44.634 --> 14:48.337
the offices for the commandant were all in the 
trigon? All in the trigon. Well, let me rephrase

14:49.512 --> 14:51.335
that. These three civilians, we had a little 
office in these little, what do they call them,

14:51.395 --> 15:00.049
lounges, and so they had an office there. The, and 
what was the, what was the Corps enrollment that

15:01.691 --> 15:06.780
fall? Do you remember? I can tell you pretty close, 
about 2,300. About 2,300. We never fell below

15:11.227 --> 15:14.592
2,000 when I was there. and describe as you come in 
that fall, describe the activities of the Corps

15:14.960 --> 15:26.821
compared with what you remembered them when you 
were a student here. What had changed and what

15:27.182 --> 15:30.808
hadn't changed? One thing is, we mentioned it 
earlier, they wore their boots. You know, we never

15:34.950 --> 15:36.212
did ours. You know, they wore them almost 
everywhere. And the other is that the, there was a

15:38.595 --> 15:51.073
pretty much, not as much segregation as there was 
in the Air Force here and the Army over on the other

15:38.595 --> 15:51.073
side and so forth. There was pretty much. You 
didn't have to be an Army ROTC cadet to be in an Air

15:52.422 --> 15:59.072
Force outfit. In other words, they were mixed up 
based on the academic area more than anything else

15:59.092 --> 16:09.267
because they were assigned, basically, if they 
didn't have a choice of outfits, If they were an

16:09.652 --> 16:19.050
engineer, we had companies that were oriented 
that way, and liberal arts were oriented and so

16:09.652 --> 16:19.050
forth, which I thought was a very good idea. We had a 
medical company, which was a very good one,

16:19.070 --> 16:24.241
engineers and so forth, signal. So those things 
were a little bit different, but I didn't

16:25.202 --> 16:30.613
really... Some of the things we used to do, like 
have a drum and bugle in the morning, I always loved

16:30.593 --> 16:36.242
that. That never happened when I came back. Used to 
have the Reveille gun fire and that went away when

16:40.088 --> 16:46.999
the veterans came back and cemented the cannon. So 
those little things were there, but the mansions

16:47.654 --> 16:54.440
were the same, the mess hall, same sort of deal. 
They did things that we never did, like lighting

16:55.421 --> 17:01.706
the napkins and burning them on people and that 
sort of stuff. The food was the same names and all

17:03.248 --> 17:07.071
that stuff, and a lot better. And the dormitories, 
they had not changed. Pretty much just like they

17:12.316 --> 17:17.020
were, except that they were allowed 
upperclassmen build their own rooms, you know,

17:17.405 --> 17:20.289
juniors and seniors. And some of them were pretty 
lavish and didn't matter back in my days. They all

17:26.158 --> 17:28.061
looked pretty much alike. And there were no room 
inspections by the Bulls anymore. We did this. We

17:35.291 --> 17:42.782
had officers responsible for certain outfits and 
they'd go through, but as far as inspections, we

17:35.291 --> 17:42.782
didn't do those. Did you, were there any problems 
that you inherited to which you had to give your

17:47.678 --> 17:51.342
immediate attention. No, it was really very easy 
to move into the job. I think had I not been an Aggie,

17:55.867 --> 17:58.730
it would have been impossible. I respect that 
choice that the commandant should always be an

17:59.110 --> 18:08.000
Aggie, and I still think he should always be an 
Aggie. I agree with you, but explain why you feel

18:08.020 --> 18:10.883
that way. Because they are totally accepted by the 
Corps when they come in. They don't have to go there

18:14.627 --> 18:17.230
and say, And these are core agas I'm talking about. 
They don't have to go over and sell themselves. And

18:23.668 --> 18:27.294
the core, if they don't like you, you might as well 
pack your bags. And I think it's pretty much that

18:28.456 --> 18:30.800
way now. They won't come in to see you if they don't 
know that you understand what they're trying to do

18:31.361 --> 18:37.412
and how they do it. And let's see, the corps 
officers for 71, 72 had already been selected

18:38.303 --> 18:48.101
before you got here, hadn't they? Yeah. So that you 
didn't have any hands. I had nothing to do, but I

18:50.105 --> 18:56.076
sure Tom Stanley was a, you may know Tom, I think 
he's a lawyer here in town now. Tom Stanley. Oh,

18:58.220 --> 18:59.421
Stanley. He was just outstanding. He was gung-ho 
military. He went airborne, ranger, served in the

19:04.227 --> 19:08.252
Army, and then become a lawyer. I haven't seen him 
since. Did anybody, Dr. Williams or Dean Hannigan

19:10.795 --> 19:20.967
or anybody give you any directions of things to do 
or not to do? Well, not really, other than Dean

19:21.487 --> 19:31.415
Hannigan, you know, wanted to tone the hazing as 
much as I could. We didn't, the women part had not

19:32.316 --> 19:38.542
come up and didn't for a couple of years. But nobody 
really came in and said, well, I want this done,

19:39.182 --> 19:43.546
that done, the other done. And Dr. Williams didn't 
either. Now, if there was a problem with some mama

19:46.128 --> 19:50.852
or something, I heard from Dr. Williams, And 
sometimes, you know, he had a temper. And

19:54.268 --> 19:57.838
sometimes he was, because they hassled him and I 
wouldn't blame him. He'd pass it down to me and he'd

19:57.858 --> 20:01.047
jump me and whatever. I'd get to the bottom of it, 
get him straightened out and go up and talk to him

20:01.629 --> 20:05.179
and he'd, You know, you're smiling exactly now. 
Give some examples of those problems that you

20:07.423 --> 20:10.647
remember. Well, in the band, I see there was one 
mother called him, and then this was in the

20:11.769 --> 20:29.033
nighttime, and her son hadn't been able to wear his 
underwear in 30 days, and she wanted it stopped.

20:29.053 --> 20:32.157
Well, the time it got to me, I didn't know that. I 
mean, I don't do underwear inspections, and

20:34.623 --> 20:42.484
Nobody told me anything else, and Dr. Williams, of 
course, let me know, and I'd go over there and find

20:34.623 --> 20:42.484
out that they'd taken their footlocker. Well, 
they didn't do that in my days either, I might

20:43.286 --> 20:47.878
mention, and so it was retaliation. They couldn't 
wear their underwear until they got his

20:47.898 --> 20:50.505
footlocker back. So I got his footlocker back and I 
got the underwear privileges. It's that sort of

20:54.678 --> 20:57.142
stuff.

20:58.944 --> 21:00.887
They were not big problems. I had a woman problem 
with one of the L leaders. His cousin was staying in

21:07.857 --> 21:18.973
the dormitory for the weekend and the other 
members weren't too fond of one of the latrines

21:07.857 --> 21:18.973
being closed off to them. show the curve and have a 
place and that sort and I was able to, you know, that

21:19.392 --> 21:25.039
was pretty easy to solve. I didn't take them off of 
the elevator, but I took them off of this command

21:26.481 --> 21:31.127
position. And did anybody give you any directions 
about the hazing that they thought was going on

21:31.147 --> 21:38.155
when you? Not in general. It was usually on 
specific incidents that happened. It was I don't

21:48.687 --> 21:54.732
think it was, it was nowhere near as bad as it was 
when I was there. And so far as I know, the board was

21:54.753 --> 21:59.257
not in the dormitory. I think it probably happened 
at beer brush they had off campus and things like

21:59.337 --> 22:03.320
that. But it wasn't, and we didn't have these deals 
where they throw water out of the dormitory

22:04.241 --> 22:14.711
windows and drown them out. We didn't do that and I 
didn't like that too much. But I couldn't have

22:18.151 --> 22:19.494
stopped it. It was one of those things that wasn't 
big enough issues to go over there and hassle

22:19.514 --> 22:23.382
about. So I pretty much could go in stride. Now the 
corps commander usually was very, very

22:28.312 --> 22:34.405
cooperative, and of all of them I had, And if there 
was a big problem, you got them and they really hit

22:34.807 --> 22:39.652
us right down. If they agree with you, if they 
don't, they'll tell you. And they say, this is a

22:42.194 --> 22:44.116
better way to do it. And they're right. I mean, 
these kids, you know, they're pretty mature. In

22:48.661 --> 22:59.051
the six years, which, to which corps commanders 
would you give the, I'm not going to ask you the

22:48.661 --> 22:59.051
negative, who were the best corps commanders you 
worked with? Well, Scott Everhard. You may know

23:02.279 --> 23:03.601
Scott. He's a very, very dear friend now. Tom 
Stanley was very good. I had one that I had to get rid

23:12.934 --> 23:15.858
of. Joe Chandler was a good one, but he was not among 
the top. Mike Gentry was outstanding, but I

23:23.108 --> 23:30.278
selected him, but I was gone when he served, but I 
know he was great. because we knew from the day he

23:31.152 --> 23:35.498
came he's going to be our corps commander. When you 
became the new commandant, what were your goals?

23:40.626 --> 23:42.809
What did you hope to achieve? Well, my primary goal 
was providing officers for the service, and with

23:42.829 --> 24:00.214
emphasis on Army, although I tried to be as 
green-coated as I could, but that was, you know,

23:42.829 --> 24:00.214
that was, we were in the war too then, early stages 
of the Vietnam War, fairly early stages of it. And

24:06.689 --> 24:14.558
so I worked real hard in programs for them as the Air 
Force was working for their programs. And we had no

24:14.578 --> 24:17.822
real conflict. When we had recruiting sessions 
and so forth, we didn't go around saying, hey, you

24:18.563 --> 24:23.689
don't want to get in the Air Force. You don't want to 
do this, that, and the other. That's all I know. I

24:26.432 --> 24:27.113
know I didn't. Now, when people came into my 
office, you know, when they come in with a

24:28.004 --> 24:34.652
freshman, I talked to everybody I could. And 
although I'm not an Army aviator, I was a crew

24:34.692 --> 24:43.322
member of airborne command post. They used to fly 
around for the nuclear war. And I had wings, so I

24:45.845 --> 24:53.534
must admit I wore my wings because, and strictly, I 
usually didn't wear them. There are a lot of these

24:54.294 --> 24:56.577
kids that say, well, I want to fly. And I'd say, 
yeah, well, the Air Force got a good program. I

24:59.422 --> 25:00.523
said, the Army does, too. And, you know, the Army 
has more pilots than the Air Force does, and still

25:01.304 --> 25:06.669
does, because of the helicopters. But that's 
about the only thing I did. And I insisted on doing

25:11.073 --> 25:24.825
the new student orientations because, first of 
all, I do a pretty good job in public speaking,

25:11.073 --> 25:24.825
getting the crowd with me, and I work very hard and 
so forth. I didn't try to sell the Army or anything.

25:28.476 --> 25:30.221
I just talked about all the programs. I didn't talk 
ROTC too much. I only talked core activities. I

25:34.091 --> 25:34.352
don't know. You might have seen one of my sessions 
or whatever. I used to do them with I can't even

25:39.993 --> 25:41.375
think of a name. I love him to death. He always tells 
us the story about the three-legged dog. Doctor,

25:47.864 --> 25:50.988
he retired years ago. He'll come to me in a minute. 
But in his new student conferences they used to

25:53.952 --> 25:57.077
have. Anyway, there was no, the military corps 
thing was not a conflict. It was a marriage more

26:06.890 --> 26:08.953
than a conflict. Did you, what was your goal in 
terms of Corps membership size? We always wanted

26:15.413 --> 26:19.686
to fill the quad. And that would have been about 
twenty? About twenty-two, twenty-three

26:21.049 --> 26:24.012
hundred, something like that. And one year, we did 
have to open up a couple of the dormitories. I've

26:27.776 --> 26:32.000
forgotten which one it was, but we had a real good 
recruiting there. I've got the numbers in here.

26:33.261 --> 26:33.862
I'll dig it out. And I think the numbers were based 
not on any, I mean, these are kids who wanted to come

26:34.823 --> 26:44.433
to A&M, but based on the war business, too. And we 
did have some programs that we introduced were

26:50.058 --> 26:57.653
very popular like we were the first ROTC unit to be 
allowed to go to jump school. The Air Force, I mean

26:58.815 --> 27:10.058
the Academies were going and my Sergeant Major 
happened to work for General Westmoreland and he

26:58.815 --> 27:10.058
was going home jumping out of airplanes anyway and 
he says, why don't we do this? Sergeant Major

27:10.078 --> 27:12.302
McDonnell, who used to be the Chief of Police. And I 
said, well, I don't know. I'll talk to the Army. And

27:15.979 --> 27:17.541
he said, no, I'm going to do better than that. And he 
could grab the phone and call it up and says, I want

27:17.602 --> 27:21.247
to talk to General Westmoreland. And he did. And 
General Westmoreland said, I don't know any

27:23.110 --> 27:30.300
reason why these people who are under contract 
can't do this. Anyway, so we started it. And we were

27:32.724 --> 27:34.847
the first to go. And the next year, they had 
Sergeant Major said to me that we're going to sign

27:41.392 --> 27:47.318
up a hundred cadets to go this year to jump school. I 
said, great. He said, I told them all if I got a

27:48.799 --> 27:52.103
hundred signed up that you would go. And I said, 
that ain't so great. I said, I'm not going to go to

27:55.386 --> 27:58.049
jump school. I said, I have no interest in that. He 
said, well, you don't have to do it like everybody

27:59.310 --> 28:01.752
else. There's a senior officer program. You've 
got to just have a good physical and whatever. I

28:06.717 --> 28:10.521
said, no way, but you tell me you promised those 
kids. I said, all right, this is what I'm going to

28:10.872 --> 28:12.475
do. I'm going to call my boss and ask, I'll have to 
have permission. And my boss, thank goodness,

28:17.967 --> 28:21.754
said, no way are you going to go to jump school. So I 
didn't go. And they understood that part of it. It

28:25.502 --> 28:28.408
wasn't my cowardice, although I wanted a part of 
it. But we also had cadets, we were the first ROTC

28:28.844 --> 28:34.911
cadets to go to ranger school. We saw a lot of them 
through ranger school. And they always come out

28:37.874 --> 28:42.639
number one, as they did in jump school and summer 
camps. One year we had cadets that were number one

28:43.300 --> 28:50.368
in all Army, Air Force, and other schools that they 
went to. As you got here and looked at the quality of

28:51.229 --> 28:56.995
the students that were in the Corps, How did that 
compare with what you remembered 30 years

28:57.818 --> 29:01.422
earlier? Or 25 years earlier? Well, they didn't 
seem to be a whole lot different. They probably

29:10.711 --> 29:16.176
were better educated than we were because the 
educational system progressed a great deal. At

29:16.216 --> 29:21.241
the time that I was a cadet, you know, we didn't have 
all these things. Even now, the 70s are out of date.

29:26.337 --> 29:29.742
But they were pretty bright people. And really, 
whoever, I don't know if the TT chose the

29:29.862 --> 29:37.973
leadership or not, but whoever did, did a pretty 
good job. We used to always have interviews and

29:38.674 --> 29:47.426
ended up pretty much doing what the outgoing 
leadership wanted. But I don't remember scoring

29:48.207 --> 29:52.513
against them except once or twice. And it 
originally had a great deal to do with whether you

29:53.168 --> 30:01.579
had a contract or not. You were supposed to have 
one. Some of them got the command and then dropped

30:02.540 --> 30:05.624
their contract for one reason or another. And I 
think I might have mentioned, I personally was

30:06.344 --> 30:14.395
opposed to that being a requirement because of my 
own situation. And I thought it was very unfair.

30:17.654 --> 30:23.503
And so I deleted that requirement, and I'm proud of 
that part of my contribution. Because, I mean,

30:24.224 --> 30:25.506
it's great. That was my job to get officers, but I 
don't want to get them on the basis of you're not

30:25.546 --> 30:35.101
going to be able to be a cadet commander if you don't 
take a ROTC contract. Now, in the routine that you

30:35.121 --> 30:37.485
developed, What was the process for selecting the 
Corps' leadership? Well, we had the military

30:43.974 --> 30:48.540
people make recommendations. They might have two 
or three outfits they were responsible for

30:49.502 --> 30:53.307
overlooking. And Malin and his crew made 
recommendations. And then we got

30:57.934 --> 31:00.999
recommendations from the Corps staff. And based 
on those, we pretty generally went along with what

31:01.940 --> 31:07.388
the Corps staff recommended. But did you 
participate in some of the interviews? I mean, all

31:11.763 --> 31:16.298
when I was president, myself and the Air Force.
