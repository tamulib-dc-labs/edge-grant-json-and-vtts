WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:06.752
Were there ever any Aggie pranks in your classes in 
those early years?

00:10.939 --> 00:12.942
Any good bull stuff?

00:20.495 --> 00:21.216
Let's see. I remember as a high school teacher, a 
hamburger cheese being put on the doorknob. No, I

00:29.090 --> 00:30.552
can't. I think the students were just incredibly 
good.

00:37.864 --> 00:42.832
Describe your workload and the courses that you 
started off teaching.

00:47.359 --> 00:56.413
I remember developing a course on the foundations 
of education, and I think I taught three courses.

00:56.579 --> 01:06.297
Foundations of Education, the History and 
Philosophy of Education,

00:56.579 --> 01:06.297
and I can't remember. All right, these were for 
undergraduates. These were all undergraduate

01:08.441 --> 01:10.124
classes. Normally what year?

01:13.927 --> 01:15.712
Well, supposedly the junior year. I think 
education courses prior to the third year did not

01:16.293 --> 01:22.229
count. So they were mainly junior and seniors. And 
I think I had several sections, maybe When I talk

01:30.430 --> 01:35.015
about three classes, I'm talking about two 
sections of one of these. But in my first few years,

01:35.876 --> 01:49.950
I taught a number of—developed a lot of different 
courses, including comparative,

01:35.876 --> 01:49.950
and then started developing graduate-level 
courses in history and philosophy. About how many

01:50.031 --> 01:54.295
per section in those years?

01:56.080 --> 02:01.068
The class room I had was not air-conditioned. It 
was up on the fourth floor, and I think it held about

02:01.088 --> 02:05.736
ninety.

02:08.701 --> 02:13.228
I usually had a pretty full class, and that would be 
a couple sections. We also taught two courses each

02:13.649 --> 02:19.438
summer session, so the summer sessions were 
really murderous because everything was

02:19.891 --> 02:23.301
condensed. I always believed in essays and 
papers. I was very busy, especially in the summer,

02:28.355 --> 02:35.655
to get everything graded. In those long semester 
classes, you normally gave how many tests and what

02:35.635 --> 02:42.202
other assignments? I always would have pretty 
much daily reading, and I would have occasional

02:42.863 --> 02:54.196
quizzes pop and other when announced. And then I 
would have, I think generally I would write about

02:55.577 --> 03:04.107
three major tests in the final. which I soon 
learned seniors didn't have to take. Graduating

03:12.163 --> 03:12.964
seniors. Graduating seniors.

03:17.269 --> 03:20.433
And then I would have a major paper. And you didn't 
have a graduate assistant in those years? No.

03:24.257 --> 03:28.542
Well, I did at one time have a graduate assistant, I 
asked not to have one in there because he took too

03:29.045 --> 03:33.873
much of my time talking. I enjoyed talking to him, 
and I liked to see the papers myself, but he did help

03:35.736 --> 03:46.634
with attendance and things like that. It was 
helpful, but he took more of my time than I think he

03:48.156 --> 03:52.623
saved, so I didn't need it. But I could have had 
help. And your classes, normally the classrooms

03:54.847 --> 04:00.000
were in the academic building. Yes, and then 
occasionally I had a class in that little annex

04:00.120 --> 04:11.168
where the library,

04:00.120 --> 04:11.168
not the library but the Harrington Annex is the two 
floor building. They had a little shack kind of a

04:16.161 --> 04:19.725
building there. At that time, what was your 
evaluation of the library holdings in the areas of

04:20.226 --> 04:28.436
education? I was pleasantly surprised. Of 
course, I had come from a small liberal arts

04:32.360 --> 04:39.889
college where education was not at all respected. 
And the library here was much, much better. And

04:47.608 --> 04:51.133
they were very helpful in ordering books. And of 
course, they had journals, the major journals

04:51.153 --> 04:56.180
that I needed. And I was pleased with the library. 
Of course, the library was making great strides at

04:58.404 --> 05:02.890
that time. Did you get any impression of the status 
that education had on this campus? Well, I thought

05:11.091 --> 05:14.980
it was held in high regard, which surprised me. I 
think Dean Hubert probably helped create that

05:18.530 --> 05:19.693
feeling. One of my first articles for publication 
was on the history of the lower class status of

05:20.474 --> 05:30.517
education in higher ed. I compared it to the lower 
class status of the minorities. went back to the

05:35.708 --> 05:45.261
days in the ancient world where if you lived a bad 
life, you came back in the next life as a teacher or a

05:35.708 --> 05:45.261
fishmonger. Now, he would be the dean of education 
for about seven or eight years. Yes. Describe him

05:54.894 --> 05:59.320
as you and your colleagues saw him as dean. He was 
always hovering. The hovering is important

06:04.445 --> 06:14.242
because you always wanted to be on your toes in case 
he showed up, and you wanted to be in your office,

06:04.445 --> 06:14.242
and you wanted to be busy. He was very 
conscientious, and you never knew if he was angry

06:18.166 --> 06:25.785
or not. And when I worked with him on some lecture 
things. He would ask questions like, how many

06:32.320 --> 06:36.667
people do you expect at this session? And I had no 
way of knowing, but he expected an answer. He

06:41.996 --> 06:55.378
expected you to know everything, which I think was 
a good mode of operation because you always were

06:41.996 --> 06:55.378
prepared. He was a very strong dean. I think he said 
General Patton was his model. Make believe that I

07:03.589 --> 07:05.731
did not know him. Describe him physically. He's 
very tall and lean, very handsome,

07:07.834 --> 07:16.826
strong features. He's slightly bent forward as he 
walked, and he engaged you very seriously at all

07:24.856 --> 07:29.104
times. He was a very serious man, but I think, of 
course, he also had a sense of humor, but that was

07:29.184 --> 07:38.461
not displayed ordinarily. What kind of hours did 
he keep working? I think he was there all the time.

07:42.980 --> 07:46.303
Was there a key secretary in the dean's office? Oh, 
yes, Peggy. Ritchie. Ritchie, yes, Peggy. She was

07:52.189 --> 07:54.772
just wonderful. And also Brian Cole was assisting 
Dean Hubert. In fact, I had him as a student in one of

08:00.979 --> 08:09.207
the undergraduate classes when he was applying to 
be certified to teach. And he was outstanding from

08:09.187 --> 08:12.611
the very beginning. Was McCandless in the dean's 
office yet? Yes, McCandless was there. I had one of

08:16.956 --> 08:19.119
his daughters in class. Yes, and he was a very fine 
man. What was his part of the leadership? What was

08:24.786 --> 08:27.569
his task? Frankly, I don't remember.

08:32.204 --> 08:38.491
I don't remember his title, but I do remember 
working with him when we wanted to get students to

08:32.204 --> 08:38.491
go abroad. This was around the early 1980s. He was 
our liaison with the regents or the directors in

08:42.536 --> 08:56.912
trying to get us to have study abroad programs in 
comparative education, which was partly my

08:42.536 --> 08:56.912
field. And he helped us get that through, and I 
think outside of foreign languages, education

08:56.892 --> 09:07.733
was quite early in getting study abroad going. As 
you began to understand the College of Education,

09:08.475 --> 09:18.394
were there any areas that we were not covering here 
that surprised you? Or in reverse, were there some

09:19.083 --> 09:24.482
areas we were covering that were a little unusual? 
In terms of the curriculum? Well, the course, I had

09:29.883 --> 09:36.754
been told that when I came there would be more 
Foundation people, but they never got any more. So

09:37.295 --> 09:38.738
I had the whole program.

09:41.643 --> 09:47.412
So I really never got off the ground the way I wanted 
to have, where we could have more in-depth. You

09:48.494 --> 09:55.806
can't teach the history of the world in one 
semester, or at least the to any degree of

09:56.377 --> 10:03.236
significance, so I would have to take certain 
periods and develop them. But I never, never until

10:03.978 --> 10:11.398
near my retirement did we ever get any more people 
that were trained somewhat in the foundations.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.481
But this is true all over the country. The 
foundations were declining with the rise of more

10:13.541 --> 10:22.915
competency-based education. They didn't know 
just what the foundations were doing. And my

10:26.701 --> 10:34.112
vision, of course, is that they were to create the 
liberal art dimension of the teacher. Were there

10:36.337 --> 10:45.937
any areas that we included that surprised you that 
many education programs were not? Well, this is

10:46.157 --> 10:48.903
the beginning of behavioral objectives. 
Behaviorism was beginning to take over

10:49.143 --> 10:52.109
education. This was not just here, but I think they 
were going stronger here than where I had been

10:56.418 --> 10:59.826
previously. Of course, behavioral objectives 
stressed the kinds of learning that could be

11:00.988 --> 11:15.321
observed and not the kind of learning that raised 
questions and provoked thought. and I was never on

11:16.583 --> 11:27.421
that side of this movement, many courses were 
developed that you had to list the objectives to be

11:16.583 --> 11:27.421
obtained.

11:29.966 --> 11:35.135
Of course, I sometimes think the most important 
objectives are ones we're not sure of when we

11:29.966 --> 11:35.135
start. However, I must say that behavioral 
objectives did tend to lead us toward the road

11:42.605 --> 11:47.055
where we wanted to go and made us stick to it. As you 
began to settle in to this institution, describe

11:48.317 --> 11:57.998
your reaction to Aggie traditions. Well, of 
course, the bonfire was the most burning

11:58.180 --> 12:02.786
tradition. Did you and your family attend? Oh, 
yes. I brought the family. My youngest son was on my

12:08.253 --> 12:10.275
shoulders. He's the only one that could see.

12:15.622 --> 12:19.427
We just enjoyed it. Of course, all along the 
campus, each cadet would say, And as some people

12:27.290 --> 12:35.829
said, they got houtied to death walking across 
campus, but it was so friendly and so spirited. And

12:37.092 --> 12:46.412
I would always check on the freshmen that were 
coming in each year, and I would overhear their

12:46.865 --> 12:49.689
work that they were doing and watched them polish 
Sully. And it struck me that this is unique, this

12:49.729 --> 12:59.263
university, and it's more than just a community of 
students. It is a community. Did you ever go to

13:01.506 --> 13:04.671
Silver Taps early? Yes. I never went to Midnight 
Yale. I never did that. I must admit, I'm waiting

13:08.536 --> 13:14.723
until I can stay up that late. What about, did you go 
to Muster early, in the early years? Oh, yes, Aggie

13:18.588 --> 13:20.651
Muster. It was my mother's birthday, by the way, 
April 21st, and I believe the first Muster was the

13:20.851 --> 13:29.241
year of her birth, 1903. I've read that somewhere. 
Of course, it goes back to San Jacinto, but I think

13:31.926 --> 13:36.454
the tradition. My mother loved it, too. She always 
wanted to go. I think the muster was probably the

13:42.685 --> 13:51.060
most significant part of the tradition. Now, how 
did you and the family become part of the

13:51.648 --> 13:55.063
community? Describe settling in. Well, I think 
the My department head, as I say, invited us over.

14:04.037 --> 14:06.500
Many of the faculty exchanged dinners. We went to 
the First Presbyterian Church, and they were

14:07.241 --> 14:18.295
very, very friendly in getting us established and 
getting acquainted. And of course, there were

14:18.315 --> 14:27.848
faculty meetings and the yearly president 
reception. But we were starting to get to be too big

14:29.752 --> 14:34.317
to be a family, I think. I don't recall any problems 
adjusting to the community. What about the school

14:40.083 --> 14:41.265
system? The school system, the children just took 
right to that. I had some problems with the way they

14:46.030 --> 14:53.498
were teaching, but I never said anything. What was 
your evaluation of the comparative quality of

14:53.478 --> 15:01.386
this school system and the one that you left in 
Pennsylvania? I would say that they were About the

15:06.893 --> 15:07.674
same. The one we left in Pennsylvania was nothing 
to brag about. We had been in New Jersey prior to

15:11.160 --> 15:21.157
that, and I think, although my oldest daughter had 
just started school, I think they had a little

15:11.160 --> 15:21.157
better facilities there. But I was always quite 
pleased, and the children were happy in school. I

15:28.223 --> 15:33.633
think the teachers were very conscientious. My 
only feeling was there's more memory in reading

15:34.354 --> 15:40.606
the textbook and reciting it. But that was true 
everywhere, I think. Where did you all do your

15:44.974 --> 15:48.561
shopping?

15:50.313 --> 15:58.986
Well, there was Piggly Wiggly, I remember, and 
Orr's bought them out, and my children called it

15:50.313 --> 15:58.986
Piggly Orr Wiggly. And then I think there was 
another one down there where the Taste of China is.

16:08.079 --> 16:13.587
There was a little grocery store where the Thruway 
town, the bypass is. I think there was a Kroger's

16:15.690 --> 16:18.514
downtown. The

16:19.827 --> 16:25.955
Townshire Shopping Center? Yes. The Townshire 
was just developed, I think, but there was another

16:26.996 --> 16:38.951
one on the—or Brown Shoe— At Villa Maria, that one— 
That one was—isn't that the Townshire? No,

16:39.372 --> 16:44.518
Townshire was the one on down Texas going north. Oh 
yeah, yes, that was there. I was thinking of that

16:48.519 --> 16:53.930
one on Briarcrest. I think it's Briarcrest. Or 
Villa Maria, whatever. In those early years, what

16:58.821 --> 17:03.250
did you and your family do for relaxation?

17:07.178 --> 17:10.823
Well, I worked all the time, and I think this is why I 
lost my family. But we did take trips. We went to Big

17:15.450 --> 17:22.960
Bend, one of the first, I think it was spring 
vacation. We loved that. And we went to Galveston

17:24.402 --> 17:30.952
and Six Flags. My family went back to New Jersey in 
the summers when I worked so hard. My

17:37.553 --> 17:46.289
mother-in-law was a widow, and she had a little 
weekend farm, and they enjoyed that. So they went

17:46.369 --> 17:48.974
for a few weeks every summer. We generally 
traveled, but I couldn't take vacation when the

17:49.996 --> 17:56.407
students, when classes were going. Then between 
classes was my big time for research. And then, of

18:02.512 --> 18:08.939
course, I had two classes each, summer sessions. 
So it was not easy to get away. But there were so many

18:13.143 --> 18:22.353
things to do around town, and the children were 
involved in many activities with the school. We

18:22.373 --> 18:24.295
played tennis.

18:26.738 --> 18:28.840
How easy was it to become a Texan? Well, I fell right 
in, but I think my wife, it took her a while. She was

18:38.132 --> 18:41.200
used to the New York scene. But I just took to it 
right away, and I loved the warm weather. Having

18:45.391 --> 18:50.318
grown up in Chicago, I had enough of that ice and 
snow. I couldn't believe that people lived here

18:50.358 --> 18:56.147
before air conditioning. I got used to air 
conditioning right away. Of course, I was worried

18:58.771 --> 19:07.865
about the expense, and I was going to issue tickets 
to the children so they couldn't go in and out so

18:58.771 --> 19:07.865
often. But it was comfortable. This is a note to the 
typist. You don't need to include this in the typed

19:13.506 --> 19:31.007
version, but I remember a lady calling in a call-in 
show on KTRH in Houston many years ago, and the

19:13.506 --> 19:31.007
emcee's name was Alvin Van Black, and this lady 
said, Alvin, how did y'all live in Houston before

19:13.506 --> 19:31.007
air conditioning? And he gave her a two-word 
answer, more slowly. But what I remember as a

19:37.383 --> 19:46.715
graduate student at Rice, the landlady from whom I 
rented a room did most of her housework before 10 in

19:37.383 --> 19:46.715
the morning. Then she closed the blinds, closed 
the shades, closed the curtains, and she did

19:47.275 --> 19:54.064
sedentary things. She didn't cook any lunch. She 
ate something out of the refrigerator that was

19:56.768 --> 19:59.391
cool. And so her theory was she was keeping the cool 
air in the house. And then at about six o'clock, in

20:08.635 --> 20:16.466
the real hot months, then she opened everything up 
and then she went out and did things in the yard and

20:08.635 --> 20:16.466
she went shopping and so forth. But that was her 
answer. That's the way to do it. We can adjust

20:20.512 --> 20:22.334
anything, I believe. But I found the warm weather 
very, very nice. All right, now you mentioned

20:26.881 --> 20:28.884
research. What were you researching in the 70s? In 
the 70s, I was mainly working on the history of the

20:31.315 --> 20:42.939
lower class to see how lower class people were 
educated. And when I moved into the education of

20:43.099 --> 20:49.172
children, I mean the history of children, which we 
know it's a little about. There are very few

20:50.815 --> 20:53.460
documents on that. We tell about our childhood, 
but we look at it through different eyes when we're

20:53.480 --> 21:00.111
adults. Then that became one of my major concerns. 
Then I developed a biography, starting with

21:03.818 --> 21:07.825
Frances Parker. I did a biography of Senator 
Yarborough Where did you find the materials for

21:12.440 --> 21:18.428
those research efforts? Well, except for the 
Parker, I didn't have the full-life research. But

21:22.695 --> 21:30.786
for Yarborough, I managed to visit him and his wife 
in Austin.

21:32.285 --> 21:39.538
And then, of course, a lot of this was in the 
congressional records and so on. Those were

21:39.598 --> 21:42.644
easily accessible presidential papers. This is 
Senator Ralph Yarbrough, who was for many years an

21:44.487 --> 21:52.842
active leader of what was then considered liberal 
wing of the Democratic Party in Texas. Yes, and he

21:56.670 --> 22:15.842
apparently, of course, in addition to getting the 
Bilingual Act through, he told me in the secret

21:56.670 --> 22:15.842
session, or the closed session, his vote got the 
Civil Rights Bill through.

22:15.822 --> 22:28.877
The history of childhood was just developing with 
Array's work on the centuries of childhood, and

22:15.822 --> 22:28.877
sources there are hard to come by. We don't have a 
lot of diaries of children and so on, so much of my

22:31.320 --> 22:36.806
material had to be secondary. And you published 
this where? Well, there were several journals

22:41.590 --> 22:45.754
that I worked with. One, the Educational Studies 
was the major vehicle of the American Association

22:47.555 --> 23:10.855
of Educational Studies, and I also published in 
Progressive Education, which died out about this

22:47.555 --> 23:10.855
time.

23:11.763 --> 23:12.240
Oh.

23:15.340 --> 23:16.101
The Forum. My mind is going up. Educational 
Thought, Philosophy of Education Journal. I was

23:30.920 --> 23:42.175
the founder of the International Society for 
Educational Biography, first president in 1982.

23:43.471 --> 23:47.795
That's still, and that journal was called Vitae 
Scholastae. What was your most, of your early

23:48.416 --> 23:53.261
publications, of which one were you most proud? 
Which was the most important of your early? Well, I

23:56.584 --> 23:58.967
think my work with Francis Parker. And then I did an 
additional work on his wife, who was a feminist,

24:00.448 --> 24:08.837
early feminist, called The Colonel's Lady. Then I 
got very much interested in qualitative

24:09.458 --> 24:14.284
research. I think my inside lives, the 
qualitative dimension of education, was

24:15.726 --> 24:29.382
probably my most important work, which was 
published in a book called Qualitative

24:15.726 --> 24:29.382
Education. In those early years, how were 
individual faculty members in education, how

24:35.750 --> 24:38.679
were they evaluated? How did you know whether you 
were proceeding well or not? Well, I believe from

24:43.573 --> 24:48.848
the very beginning we had student evaluation 
forms. And we would discuss the results of these

24:49.233 --> 24:55.019
with the department head.

24:57.782 --> 24:59.524
It was rather very informal. Of course, later on it 
became more technical with the documentation and

24:59.785 --> 25:07.673
so on. This was mainly just going over our student 
evaluations. And I got some cute evaluations. I

25:17.413 --> 25:23.239
remember one student, if only they'd give Dr. 
Campbell something good to teach. Too much

25:25.502 --> 25:26.362
history. But the students were always very, very 
kind. But I think that's the only way we were

25:34.791 --> 25:37.354
evaluated. And of course, going up for promotion 
was another matter. Now you came with what rank? I

25:43.200 --> 26:00.143
came as an associate

25:43.200 --> 26:00.143
professor, I think, and head of the department at 
Lycoming, and three years later I was eligible for

25:43.200 --> 26:00.143
tenure, and I think then I made professor.

26:02.646 --> 26:07.553
But I came as an associate.

26:07.533 --> 26:11.218
salaries and promotions on a merit basis as far as 
you would know? They were not merit as far as I knew.

26:13.161 --> 26:13.381
Here? No, I don't remember. They may have been, and 
of course the department head was the one who

26:15.204 --> 26:19.710
decided. I was never much interested in salaries 
and what was going on. I just wanted to do the best I

26:25.078 --> 26:29.524
could. I'm sure there was some merit, but later on I 
think it was formally. I don't like to think of

26:34.493 --> 26:37.138
merit. I believe teachers should not be competing 
with one another.

26:46.042 --> 26:49.047
describe the program when you got here. Was there a 
master's degree already approved when you

26:49.388 --> 26:53.976
arrived? I believe there was. I believe that we had 
a master's, but I was not teaching at graduate

26:56.460 --> 27:08.742
level for several years. It may have just been 
approved. We were approved of our certification

27:13.342 --> 27:28.259
in various fields, and

27:13.342 --> 27:28.259
we were still developing elementary and 
secondary program, continually revising

27:13.342 --> 27:28.259
curriculum. Our faculty meetings were always 
just continually revising. It was a very pioneer

27:32.884 --> 27:38.070
kind of time.

27:38.455 --> 27:46.386
I can't recall now about the master's, but it was 
several years before I developed graduate

27:38.455 --> 27:46.386
courses. And then they cut all the foundations of 
the undergraduate, which I didn't think was a good

27:46.506 --> 27:55.438
idea. So then I just was at the graduate level. What 
were some marks of the progress that the College of

28:02.165 --> 28:12.359
Education was making?

28:12.379 --> 28:22.452
As I say, we were developing the behavioral 
objective almost to the extent that courses were

28:12.379 --> 28:22.452
series of behaviors.

28:29.350 --> 28:33.721
I think the College of Education was very avant 
garde. In the beginning, we were not even known in

28:34.162 --> 28:37.008
the state of Texas. They didn't know that Texas A&M 
had a College of Education. I think we were still

28:42.007 --> 28:45.791
getting developed. I was also the advisor for the 
Texas

28:46.572 --> 28:59.906
Education Society, and many of these students did 
not know. When they went to conferences, they were

28:59.926 --> 29:04.671
not known. But the college soon became very 
visible in the state and was producing more and

29:08.416 --> 29:13.948
more students. I'm sorry that I don't have the 
figures. I'm sure they're officially documented

29:16.473 --> 29:20.201
somewhere. Which other schools in Texas do you 
think were the most highly regarded in education?

29:29.138 --> 29:30.941
Well, of course, the University of Texas. I had a 
couple of Columbia friends who taught in the

29:31.322 --> 29:40.598
College of Education there in Austin. I don't 
think there was, in foundations, there was

29:42.001 --> 29:46.068
nothing to compare. And of course, they were much 
farther ahead than we were. They had four or five

29:49.675 --> 29:53.762
foundation people.

29:55.160 --> 30:12.401
I did attend some meetings down at the University 
of Houston, and they were going wild on this school

29:55.160 --> 30:12.401
without walls, which developed all over Houston. 
And one time I taught an off-campus course in one of

30:12.481 --> 30:19.750
those buildings where there's no walls. You have 
to just give people worksheets. I mean, there's no

30:24.827 --> 30:29.195
way you can talk if you have a loud voice next door. 
But they were kind of avant-garde in that. Of

30:34.665 --> 30:40.877
course, Rice was not known for his education, but 
that of course was the the elite school of Texas.

30:44.020 --> 30:52.249
But I think in my field it was definitely the 
University of Texas. Now Sherman had a good—I knew

30:52.329 --> 30:58.416
people at Sherman in foundations. That was now the 
University of North Texas, I think. You mean

31:01.639 --> 31:02.260
Denton? Denton. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

31:07.385 --> 31:11.374
Correct me, my faulty memory, it was in Denton. 
Sherman is where Martha went to college, Austin

31:11.394 --> 31:14.802
College. Yeah, and yours truly is in Austin 
College. Did you go to Austin College? I'd

31:20.394 --> 31:21.537
forgotten that. She loved it there and I thought it 
was marvelous. Oh, it was great for me. They had a

31:25.947 --> 31:29.235
five-year education program. My great honor came 
two falls ago. I was the 150th anniversary

31:33.305 --> 31:38.758
sesquicentennial speaker. Oh, for goodness 
sakes. Well, you know, that is one of the oldest

31:40.943 --> 31:47.269
schools, and I think it was originally somewhere 
in Huntsville, wasn't it? That's right. They

31:48.591 --> 31:51.694
moved it up to Sherman because of malaria and 
yellow fever. And they had an opera house, and it

31:52.214 --> 31:56.138
was bigger than Dallas, wasn't it? Yes. I recall 
picking up little things. Oh, yes. The campus

32:03.044 --> 32:06.788
leadership, Jack Williams and John Calhoun, What 
did you and your colleagues think of Jack Williams

32:07.122 --> 32:14.013
and John Calhoun as the president and the vice 
president? Very highly, very highly. And I was in

32:15.856 --> 32:24.330
several meetings with Calhoun when I was with TACT 
and other organizations and thought so highly of

32:15.856 --> 32:24.330
him. But Williams was the, I think, the 
inspiration for everybody. Describe their

32:30.260 --> 32:32.944
manner and their style. Well, Williams was a very 
smooth lecturer,

32:34.038 --> 32:42.520
but he was also very available. He would sometimes 
sit down in the cafeteria and talk to faculty.

32:51.368 --> 33:06.740
I think you had the feeling that he was on your side 
and he was trying to develop high standards,

32:51.368 --> 33:06.740
working to make this a great university, but he was 
very friendly in style. I think Calhoun was too.

33:10.508 --> 33:12.432
Calhoun was a little more impure.
