00:01.972 --> 00:04.815
No, I'm not sorry that I served in Vietnam. I'm 
proud that I served in Vietnam. I don't have any

00:08.279 --> 00:13.385
regrets about my personal service in Vietnam. 
Just looking back

00:15.527 --> 00:25.478
at 15 or 20 years ago, I wish that it could have been 
handled maybe differently than it was at the time.

00:26.159 --> 00:28.401
Do you think we did anything right in Vietnam?

00:33.241 --> 00:42.917
I started to say that we may have very, very good 
withdraw from Vietnam, but I'm not sure I think

00:33.241 --> 00:42.917
that was almost kind of botched.

00:47.946 --> 00:48.968
I don't know. I'm not sure I can answer that we we did 
anything that was of any value in Vietnam. We set

00:57.162 --> 00:57.983
out to preserve the government of South Vietnam, 
that we didn't do that. If we set out to show the

01:02.080 --> 01:09.969
world that the United States is a military power to 
be reckoned with, we didn't do that. I think we

01:10.690 --> 01:12.572
tarnished our military image. I think we 
tarnished our worldwide image

01:12.612 --> 01:27.109
by making the decision to be there and not 
accomplishing whatever purposes we thought we

01:12.612 --> 01:27.109
were there for. We probably really didn't do 
anything right in Vietnam. What was it like coming

01:34.773 --> 01:35.974
home?

01:39.139 --> 01:44.086
Well, it was a very joyful experience. As I recall, 
only a few days before I left Vietnam, a regular

01:44.106 --> 01:56.083
dinner that we had in our unit for people, 
newcomers and people that were leaving. I got to

01:56.519 --> 02:05.329
make a farewell address, and I told the gathering 
that I was leaving Vietnam with mixed emotions,

01:56.519 --> 02:05.329
joy and happiness. So that's kind of the way I felt 
about coming home. I was glad to be home. I know when

02:12.657 --> 02:21.547
we landed at Travis Air Force Base, the entire 
plane broke into cheers and applause. So I was glad

02:21.867 --> 02:23.949
to be home. I had missed my family. I was glad to be 
back to see them. What was the biggest adjustment?

02:35.303 --> 02:43.791
Probably

02:35.303 --> 02:43.791
changing my language from military language back 
to acceptable civilian language. And

02:45.193 --> 02:54.522
I guess adjusting to a wife and a daughter, back 
living with them. That's probably about the only

02:56.628 --> 02:59.331
thing I can think of. It's kind of very different 
living with the guys than with the family. Well, I

03:02.014 --> 03:05.318
really, it is, and I, you know, I lived alone. I had 
my own room. It was just a room, but just to change a

03:06.800 --> 03:26.483
little bit on a lifestyle that was a little 
restrained and that I didn't have a lot of freedom

03:06.800 --> 03:26.483
of movement, but not living with somebody daily, 
not really having a... responsibility for a wife

03:26.615 --> 03:30.018
and a child. Even though I did have their 
responsibility, I didn't have daily contact with

03:31.259 --> 03:36.844
them to have their responsibility. How often did 
you, did you receive mail or could you call or what

03:36.864 --> 03:43.229
contact did you have with home? I had, I probably 
have a couple of bushel baskets full of letters

03:43.370 --> 03:55.440
around here somewhere that Linda wrote me almost 
daily and And I wrote her almost daily. We sent

03:58.851 --> 04:02.316
tapes back and forth to each other. I got to talk to 
her on the telephone

04:04.199 --> 04:22.305
probably

04:04.199 --> 04:22.305
five or six times through the, I don't know what 
they called it, but it was a radio connect up where I

04:04.199 --> 04:22.305
could get on the radio kind of ham operators type 
thing and we could connect up with a ham operator at

04:23.095 --> 04:49.575
Fort Bliss in El Paso and then he would call Linda on 
the phone and I could talk to her that way and then I

04:23.095 --> 04:49.575
think on three occasions twice I went into into 
Saigon into the

04:59.073 --> 05:28.354
it was the USO club in Saigon and they had a 
telephone that I could call long distance and talk

04:59.073 --> 05:28.354
to her just like a long distance telephone call and 
I did that twice I think and then on Christmas Eve I

04:59.073 --> 05:28.354
got to call her from the base just on a regular long 
distance hookup so I talked to her occasionally

04:59.073 --> 05:28.354
and we wrote a lot And she sent me lots of care 
packages.

05:35.594 --> 05:39.758
When you came home, how were you welcomed by people 
outside your family? Oh, I think I was well

05:41.380 --> 05:49.848
received by the people

05:41.380 --> 05:49.848
outside of my family, as well as in my family. Most 
of the folks in this part of the world were not war

05:51.670 --> 05:58.476
protesters. They were not out burning their draft 
cards or the United States, their American flag.

06:04.658 --> 06:15.328
So, you know, I think they looked on me as somebody 
who served my country and did my job and didn't

06:04.658 --> 06:15.328
think that I was a murderer or a scoundrel or 
whatever. Looking back, what was the worst part of

06:16.550 --> 06:21.154
the war for you? The separation from my family.

06:28.361 --> 06:29.222
I think that was it. What about the best?

06:42.115 --> 06:44.957
I've got some pretty good friends that I made when I 
was in Vietnam. I don't see a lot now, but we were

06:45.078 --> 06:49.702
very close. So I think I made some awfully good 
friends. You can't beat coming home. It's been the

06:56.608 --> 06:58.230
best thing. I made some very good friends when I was 
over there. Do you think the friendships in war are

07:01.998 --> 07:08.970
much closer than at a war? I mean, besides family 
bonds. I think that's probably true of people that

07:10.933 --> 07:24.015
served in World War II and in World War I more so than 
it is of people that served in Vietnam.

07:26.307 --> 07:44.153
understanding that I do not serve in a combat 
situation and I suspect that bonds between people

07:26.307 --> 07:44.153
that serve in combat become a lot closer than 
people that serve in a rear area. If there was such a

07:44.174 --> 07:46.337
thing as a rear area in Vietnam.

07:49.481 --> 07:53.968
I would say that they do have strong bonds But it's 
almost going to be, in my opinion, tied to the level

07:54.640 --> 08:07.353
of danger or risk that they're exposed to is to how 
close those bonds are. Or how estranged, if that's

08:07.373 --> 08:10.777
the proper word, they would be. I would think that 
you could have love-hate relationships

08:11.338 --> 08:21.048
depending on the interaction between the people 
in a stress situation. Mm-hmm. Kind of sometimes

08:24.593 --> 08:28.296
you're too close to... That's right. Too close to 
people. You said that you officed with someone

08:30.718 --> 08:33.581
from Civil Affairs. That's right. What did you 
learn about the Civil Affairs operations?

08:44.070 --> 08:50.595
Mainly the Civil Affairs was an operation that I 
saw. It was an operation to educate, the

08:55.745 --> 09:15.333
Vietnamese to communicate and interact with the 
Vietnamese to basically try to help them adjust to

08:55.745 --> 09:15.333
and adapt to the presence of the United States 
military in Vietnam. It was an effort to win them

09:15.353 --> 09:23.305
over to the side of the United States by education 
and involvement, communication, participation

09:25.394 --> 09:42.764
in their daily lives, aid in medical, farming, 
that type of aid. So it was an education and an

09:43.786 --> 09:47.172
assistance program. How effective do you think it 
was?

09:52.732 --> 09:54.794
It'd be purely a guess on my part. I never really saw 
it on the level out in the field where they were

09:54.874 --> 10:00.220
dealing with those folks. I think it had some good 
effects, but it's probably like any,

10:01.542 --> 10:19.802
like I would probably feel if the Germans or the 
Russians or anyone were to invade the United

10:01.542 --> 10:19.802
States and then start trying to give me propaganda 
to tell me how I ought to like to have them over here.

10:24.913 --> 10:33.604
So I think it probably was effective for some, but 
not effective for everyone. But it's a process I

10:34.385 --> 10:36.488
think you have to do. Did you ever have to deal with 
any incidents between Vietnamese and Americans?

10:45.000 --> 10:45.620
In cases? No. Well, no.

10:52.537 --> 11:04.013
I did not handle any files where we had any 
Vietnamese nationals involved.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.955
I can recall that now. I wasn't involved in 
anything similar to the Cali incident or the Mila

11:05.975 --> 11:15.288
incident or anything like that. Those types of 
things were handled at the general court martial

11:15.528 --> 11:19.894
level. And there were some handled in the long bin, 
which is right where I was. But that was all at the

11:28.185 --> 11:32.230
general quarters level. Well, there were some 
handled at the two field force level, too. But I

11:37.097 --> 11:38.419
didn't handle any of them. I had no direct 
involvement with them. Do you think, because you

11:41.693 --> 11:48.823
have such a short tour duty, did that affect any of 
the legal operations? I mean, did they just bring

11:49.704 --> 11:51.747
one lighter in and one out? Yeah, I don't think it 
did.

11:55.993 --> 12:09.372
Most of the people that came into Vietnam in the 
legal area were already experienced from a

11:55.993 --> 12:09.372
stateside assignment or assignment in Europe. So 
they, it was a very easy transition.

12:17.241 --> 12:21.527
Did you see it, I guess, harming any other 
positions?

12:27.876 --> 12:32.423
I didn't, not that I can say that I saw it harming any 
other positions. I don't really think that

12:34.478 --> 12:39.665
they had any problem making those transitions. 
Somebody answer the phone.

12:46.314 --> 12:47.376
That'll look great on your tape. No, I don't think 
they had any problems just because of the short

12:49.239 --> 12:53.264
tourism duty. But you had the same commander, 
though, Colonel? Yes. He got there just about a few

12:58.652 --> 13:03.979
months before I did, and we were on the same plane 
going home. He let the same guy in. Do you ever see

13:07.101 --> 13:07.682
him? No, I haven't seen him since we got off the 
plane at Travis Air Force Base.

13:18.193 --> 13:18.393
Okay. Summing up, is there anything else you want 
to add? No, I don't know. I can't think of anything.

13:32.768 --> 13:33.409
I can't think of anything.
