WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:03.973
One, two, three, four. One, two, three. Can we do 
that too? One, two, three, four. This is December

00:11.841 --> 00:20.069
the 12th, year 2000, down in the Jack Kenny 
Williams Administration Building. I have the

00:20.509 --> 00:27.636
honor and pleasure of chatting with Mary Ruth 
Patronella, whose title now is... Assistant to

00:20.509 --> 00:27.636
the Dean. Assistant to the Dean of Agriculture. 
want to record her memories of what it has been like

00:31.925 --> 00:38.253
to be a member of the staff here for a good many 
years. First, introduce yourself to anyone who

00:39.054 --> 00:42.199
might read or hear this. Where did you grow up? What 
did your family do? Where did you go to school? And

00:45.884 --> 00:46.645
so forth. OK. I was born in Edge, Texas, which is in 
the northern part of the county. I went to school at

00:53.734 --> 00:55.536
Edge. They had elementary and about two grades, I 
believe, in high school. Then I came to Brine High

01:00.494 --> 01:04.459
and graduated from Brine. What year? 1938. How 
many in the senior class? I could find that out, but

01:10.006 --> 01:16.013
I don't have it from memory because I have the 
program for our graduation. You lived out in the

01:16.714 --> 01:17.895
country? I lived in the country and rode the bus to 
Brine. After I graduated, I didn't feel like that I

01:22.685 --> 01:29.895
could go to college, and I didn't have a job. Being 
out in the country, I guess I just didn't know what I

01:30.595 --> 01:33.199
was supposed to do. So I went back to Bryan High and 
took postgraduate work and worked in the

01:33.840 --> 01:40.468
principal's office. My daddy knew D.W. Williams, 
and he asked Mr. Williams about my finding

01:47.153 --> 01:51.041
employment in the animal science department he 
was head. And he said he needed someone who had

01:51.622 --> 01:56.070
experience. And I had no experience. I don't 
really remember how I but got a job in the division

02:02.020 --> 02:09.876
of poultry science, which is part of the 
experiment station located on the F&B station.

02:10.818 --> 02:20.839
But my first job was at the poultry house to count 
egg records, where they had sheets for a hen and

02:10.818 --> 02:20.839
made stick marks. And I counted those stick marks 
first. And when did you go to work on the campus?

02:26.344 --> 02:27.425
That was December of 39. December of 39. Do you 
remember what your pay was? The only question I'm

02:30.609 --> 02:33.512
going to ask about money, do you remember what your 
first pay was? I'm trying to think. I think it was $2

02:34.373 --> 02:40.960
a day, and we worked five and a half days, so I 
probably made about $11 a week. And you lived at

02:41.581 --> 02:42.442
home. I lived with friends in Bryanville. Oh, 
okay. How did you get back and forth on the campus?

02:47.948 --> 02:50.050
We used to have carpools. And the car would be full. 
People would go around to the different homes and

02:54.078 --> 03:02.487
get a car full and come to Texas A&M. Describe the 
campus in those days. What was it like? What were

03:06.992 --> 03:08.013
the major buildings? Well, where I was is out at 
F&B. And there was poultry, dairy, and swine. And

03:16.582 --> 03:20.526
they each had these frame houses, offices. And the 
person in charge of the unit was called chief.

03:27.434 --> 03:27.754
Chief. Chief. Chief of the division. Who was the, 
was poultry science even a separate department

03:31.019 --> 03:35.486
then? It was a division of the Texas Agricultural 
Experiment Station. And it was before the

03:39.933 --> 03:45.141
coordination of teaching, research, and 
extension. That didn't happen, I think, until

03:46.464 --> 03:49.348
about 1947. And your normal work day was an eight to 
five? Yes, sir. Eight to five. What about lunch?

03:55.654 --> 03:57.379
Well, I guess we carried our lunch. We had sack 
lunches. How was a young woman treated on the

04:00.688 --> 04:05.380
campus then? Well, I think, well, you know, of 
course, as I say, I was out off the campus, really,

04:05.545 --> 04:12.853
to start. So you didn't see many students? No, I 
didn't see many students out there. You were

04:17.058 --> 04:19.060
counting these eggs. That was part of the 
experiment, the search? Yes, sir. Was there a

04:22.805 --> 04:26.429
particular person whose work y'all were 
watching? We did, I don't know whether you

04:27.109 --> 04:31.074
remember Russell Couch and Lee James? Mm-hmm. 
were there and when the war started they had

04:32.377 --> 04:38.486
commissions and went into the service. So what 
happened to your accounts? Then we had some people

04:41.430 --> 04:49.081
come in and I'm trying to think one of them was named 
Dr. Mellis and then someone named Baker. How's

04:49.962 --> 04:52.346
Mellis spelled? M-E-L-L-A-I-S-S

04:53.447 --> 05:01.118
I think I'm not sure I can't remember but I remember 
his name was Vivian And he said, you know, that was a

05:01.587 --> 05:08.113
lady's name and he didn't, he wanted to be called 
V.H.

05:10.636 --> 05:14.880
instead of Vivian.

05:15.100 --> 05:19.285
When you started work, the war in Europe already 
was underway. Yes, sir. How much did y'all, did

05:20.246 --> 05:27.713
that affect your life here in Bryan and the campus?

05:28.418 --> 05:30.601
And there's gas rationing, so. Well, no, no, not 
yet. In 39 and 40. No, no, not then. But the war, you

05:35.008 --> 05:36.790
know, affects. During the war, they had a policy 
that they changed the time you went to work or you

05:38.253 --> 05:46.765
could go to work from 8 to 7. How long did you stay 
with Polter Science? Until October of. 41, I

05:53.562 --> 05:57.286
believe that that's. And then, so what was your? 
Then my husband was called into the service. And,

06:02.131 --> 06:05.155
no, I'm telling you wrong, Doctor. It wasn't 41. It 
must have been later than that. 43. So when, you got

06:13.103 --> 06:14.465
married when? In December, I mean October 1941. 
And your husband, what was his profession? He

06:22.081 --> 06:24.984
owned a restaurant in Brown. At that time. Okay. 
But you continued to work here on the campus.

06:29.328 --> 06:30.529
Continued to work on the campus. Do you remember 
where you were when you heard the news on December

06:31.129 --> 06:35.713
7, 1941? Yes, sir, I do. Describe that, please. We 
were, my parents lived in the country. We went out

06:40.758 --> 06:44.261
there every Sunday or every other Sunday. And we 
were on our way to Edge when we heard that about,

06:51.258 --> 06:53.641
Pearl Harbor being bombed. Did you or your husband 
or anyone else guess as to how your life might be

06:54.923 --> 07:02.812
changed by that? Not at the time, I don't think. Did 
you know where Pearl Harbor was? Not really. Not

07:08.279 --> 07:08.720
really. I didn't. When I heard it, I just knew it was 
somewhere on the other side of the world. All

07:13.706 --> 07:15.128
right. And was he in the reserve? No, sir. He was 
drafted. drafted and your new task then that your

07:21.160 --> 07:31.556
second slot here on the campus was where? Your 
second job. In the Department of Animal Science,

07:32.237 --> 07:35.442
Animal Husbandry at the time. And where 
physically? Animal Industries Building. The

07:39.708 --> 07:43.173
first job I had there though was bookkeeper for the 
Meats Laboratory. Who was the department head

07:44.235 --> 07:45.717
then? I'm trying to think. Seemed like Mr. 
Dahlberg was interim.

07:54.225 --> 07:55.547
And a young man named O.D. Butler, was he? Well, he 
was, when he came back from the war, he, Dr. Jack

07:56.609 --> 08:04.179
Miller was head. And there were about three people 
there that Dr. Miller suggested they go to

08:05.481 --> 08:10.228
graduate school. And one of them was O.D. Was O.D. 
And Bill Warren and George Robertson. All right,

08:17.776 --> 08:21.240
so you worked there throughout the war. That puts 
you on the campus. Describe what happened here

08:24.664 --> 08:27.948
during the war. What was the campus like? Well, you 
know, it's hard for me to remember exactly what it

08:30.992 --> 08:37.260
was like, Dr. Monroe. I know that, of course, a lot 
of the students, you know, had to go to the service.

08:42.846 --> 08:45.049
And I don't know what their enrollment really was. 
Were you as a woman treated politely here on

08:45.468 --> 08:49.495
campus? I think I've always been treated 
politely. And

08:53.482 --> 09:06.746
so the I know that the campus went to a trimester 
system and they went to class 12 months a year to get

08:53.482 --> 09:06.746
everybody out faster. Did the enrollment go down? 
You know, when I started, as I say, I was a

09:10.291 --> 09:14.117
bookkeeper in the meats lab. And they were killing 
cattle for the dining halls, for the markets and

09:15.158 --> 09:27.237
brine, because there was no other slaughter 
plant. And we had about 220 lockers down in the

09:27.554 --> 09:32.004
basement. And so we were, I was really involved in 
that. And we made a report to the board of directors

09:37.356 --> 09:40.944
every month. We would bind up a financial report. 
And so there would have been a big cash flow. And I

09:49.387 --> 10:09.222
would come to the this building where the fiscal 
office and bring the money you know that we would

09:49.387 --> 10:09.222
our sales fund and we had a cash riding machine and 
we had someone buying cattle and the department

09:49.387 --> 10:09.222
paid him a dollar a head to do that was Mr. Yeager. 
Yeager? Yeager. Y-E-A-G-E-R? Yes, sir. And he,

10:13.084 --> 10:14.085
W.O. Yeager. And I could write, had the check 
writing machine and pay him and then get

10:15.567 --> 10:23.095
reimbursed. And this was not part of any research 
or anything. No. This was a cash operation. This

10:30.844 --> 10:31.725
was an operation. I don't know how they got 
started, but they had been without someone to do

10:31.806 --> 10:38.213
that work for about two months. When I came over, 
they had some gentleman that was doing it first.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.577
Where was the slaughtering operation located? 
West of the tracks? No, it was over here in the

10:46.879 --> 10:49.222
Animal Industries building. Oh, okay. There were 
those holding pens beside the building and the

10:50.363 --> 10:58.454
killing floor and cutting room. Who did that? Were 
they hired or were they students? No, there was a

11:04.682 --> 11:06.324
staff. Okay. And that went on through the war? Yes, 
sir. I'm not sure when they... Well, they still

11:10.827 --> 11:21.463
have some, but they... Then they got to have the 
co-op, I believe, has a slaughter plant or

11:10.827 --> 11:21.463
something. And the lockers, they took all those 
out. The range line ecology and management is in

11:24.768 --> 11:30.977
that department, in that building now. Now, they 
bought the cattle from this general area. I

11:36.057 --> 11:36.918
suppose so. A wide variety of cattle? No specific? 
No specific. And your task continued through the

11:45.470 --> 11:48.434
war. Well, there was a time when the animal science 
department didn't have a secretary. So I go up to

11:56.626 --> 11:58.909
the departments head's office and I become the 
secretary and they hired someone to take my place

11:59.294 --> 12:05.525
as bookkeeper. Oh okay and you who was the 
department head then when you were the department

12:05.545 --> 12:12.497
secretary? Part of the time it was Dr. Jack Miller 
and as I say he went he left here I'm not sure when and

12:12.517 --> 12:22.534
went to Tennessee and came back as department 
head. I think when it was, when he came back it was

12:24.565 --> 12:33.717
when they coordinated the research, teaching, 
and extension. Describe the variety of tasks that

12:34.177 --> 12:38.182
the departmental secretary had to handle. Well, 
we did, we took shorthand, we filed, answered the

12:39.043 --> 12:48.775
phone,

12:50.088 --> 12:52.390
And describe what kind of typewriter you used. 
Well, I had a manual typewriter first. And we had,

12:55.754 --> 13:04.122
you know, correcting those copies that you had to 
have carbon paper wasn't too much fun. Now, you had

13:04.943 --> 13:10.449
taken typing and shorthand at Bryan High.

13:12.451 --> 13:15.854
What kind of work hours did the departmental 
secretary have to put in? We put in eight hours. And

13:19.096 --> 13:27.590
at that, we finally got to where only one girl and 
one faculty member had to be at work on Saturdays.

13:28.692 --> 13:30.615
We took turns doing that. And you were still living 
out in the country? No, I was married then and

13:34.241 --> 13:35.823
living in Bryan. Oh, you were living in. And during 
the war, with gas rationing and so forth, describe

13:38.568 --> 13:45.559
how that changed your routine. I managed okay with 
the rationing. I guess we just didn't drive too

13:50.337 --> 13:51.819
much. When I went to California, I went up to the 
rationing board and got the ration to drive to

13:52.560 --> 14:00.992
California. So I drove our car all the way from here 
to California, and about that time they reduced

14:01.733 --> 14:12.087
the number of gallons you could get per coupon, but 
I still made it all right. Now, were you going out

14:12.202 --> 14:13.905
there to see your husband? Yes. He was in Army? 
Army. Army. And you didn't drive by yourself. He

14:23.560 --> 14:25.783
had a friend whose wife was in Illinois. She rode 
the train to Hearn, and I picked her up, and she went

14:26.344 --> 14:30.090
with me. Do you remember how long it took you to 
drive it? We drove to Midland, I think, one day, and

14:33.700 --> 14:42.589
about Mesa, Arizona the next, and then into Los 
Angeles the following day, about three days. And

14:44.350 --> 14:47.754
was he going overseas, or had he already... At that 
time, he wasn't. They were a training cadre. But

14:50.977 --> 14:59.185
then he was moved to Oregon, and he was one of the 
ones that they took out of that... and filled a unit

15:00.127 --> 15:04.234
that was going overseas. And served in the 
Pacific? No, in Europe, in Italy. In Italy? Oh, oh.

15:11.968 --> 15:20.523
So instead of California to the Pacific, he went 
to... We came back home, had a little bit of time to

15:11.968 --> 15:20.523
come back home and drive the car home. And then he 
went, in about six days, he went back to be shipped

15:20.543 --> 15:24.750
to overseas. As far as you can recall, other than 
gas, what other things were most hard to obtain

15:25.388 --> 15:32.298
during the war? One was sugar, shoes. I may still 
have some coupons. What about nylon stockings?

15:41.952 --> 15:48.662
Well, I don't really remember much about that, 
probably.

15:50.009 --> 15:53.114
Describe the area around the campus. What was 
College Station like during those years? Well, if

15:57.562 --> 16:02.570
you, when I think of it, this building kind of sat 
out here by itself. The Animal Industries

16:03.552 --> 16:11.545
Building and Scotes Hall and maybe some buildings 
that used to be the Experiment Station

16:03.552 --> 16:11.545
headquarters. It was certainly not built up like 
it is today. Where did you park your car? Over by the

16:22.585 --> 16:24.388
building. Right behind the building. And I got a 
station wagon without power steering one time,

16:26.471 --> 16:34.343
and when they started you know, giving people 
assigned parking spaces. Dr. Butler gave me one in

16:40.038 --> 16:42.723
front of the Animal Industries building. And I 
didn't want that because it was a little hard for me

16:44.586 --> 16:49.073
to park it. So I asked him if I could just not have a 
parking place, and I still parked over by the

16:49.413 --> 16:53.980
building. He always said, if you got here early 
enough, you found a parking place. So I usually did

16:58.467 --> 16:59.689
that. Now, when you first came over to animal 
science, who was the dean of agriculture then? Dr.

17:08.042 --> 17:09.504
Kyle, Dean Kyle. Describe him. We don't know much 
about Dean Kyle. Well, I remember him coming to my

17:12.509 --> 17:20.041
office and telling me how he appreciated what I was 
doing with the meat slab work. And of course, I

17:21.623 --> 17:24.087
didn't know him very well either. Physically, 
what did he look like? Big, small? Seems to me like,

17:30.078 --> 17:36.151
I really can't say, but we've got pictures of him 
back here in the office. Outgoing personality?

17:39.518 --> 17:40.099
Shy? What? Well, you know, really, I didn't have 
that much contact with him. I just remember him

17:46.994 --> 17:48.998
coming in my office and letting me know that he 
appreciated what I was doing. Who was the next

17:52.312 --> 17:55.876
dean? I believe it was Shepardson. Describe him. 
What was he like? Well, of course, being where I

18:01.761 --> 18:05.725
was, I didn't have much. I've got this for you that 
gives you the time for these deans. I'd have to look

18:11.931 --> 18:14.493
at it myself to really... He's 44 to 55.

18:19.876 --> 18:28.574
When the veterans came back, well let's see, in 
your family, when did the key men in your life come

18:19.876 --> 18:28.574
back? October, I believe, of 45. uh and I hope no 
injuries well he was he did get the Purple Heart and

18:35.992 --> 18:59.451
the Oakleaf Cluster but it wasn't anything that 
was severe shot through the thigh and then got

18:35.992 --> 18:59.451
shrapnel in the shoulder so he went back into the 
his restaurant a restaurant and you all still

18:35.992 --> 18:59.451
lived in town Did you ever think during that period 
of stopping work on campus? No, sir. Not until my

19:06.962 --> 19:10.786
oldest son was born. That's when I stopped at that 
time. And I really didn't have an idea that I would

19:13.308 --> 19:15.630
come back. So I got my teacher retirement money 
out. When was that? That was in December of 49. 49.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.442
And Pat was born 28th of January. And so you thought 
you were retiring. Well, what led you to come back?

19:34.730 --> 19:37.319
Dr. Butler was, Dr. O.D. Butler was head of the 
department. He had someone in the bookkeeping

19:39.323 --> 19:42.568
department who wanted to retire. Her name was 
Bessie Lou Smith. And so he called me and asked me if

19:45.293 --> 19:48.859
I would come back. But she wasn't leaving at that 
point. So it took about six months before she

19:51.423 --> 19:54.769
really left. And he would call me once in a while and 
ask me what I was thinking or how I felt about it. And

20:01.520 --> 20:03.083
describe this man, O.D. Butler. He was a general. 
He was a fine person to work for. I enjoyed that very

20:08.790 --> 20:10.012
much. See, I went to high school in Orange where he 
grew up. I did not know him over there. I knew his

20:16.560 --> 20:20.385
brother who was a very active civic leader. And so 
when you said he was general, I know he was a firm

20:21.307 --> 20:26.774
person. Yes, he was. Did he also know how to relax? 
Did he have a sense of humor? Yes, he did. And I think

20:33.552 --> 20:35.174
he relaxed. I think he played golf.

20:39.138 --> 20:45.865
But I would go to the department meetings, and he 
would always tease Dr. Kunkel about not being

20:39.138 --> 20:45.865
married. And he did that to Cliff Laywell. And he 
was very outspoken, and he said what he thought.

20:57.725 --> 20:59.367
What were his joys? What did he enjoy most? Well, I 
think he was chair of the Athletic Council. And I

21:08.195 --> 21:16.203
think also while I was working for him, he bought 
the land that they now own out here. I probably

21:16.964 --> 21:18.586
typed some of those letters. South of the campus 
down on Welborn Road. Yes, sir. And it belonged to

21:25.720 --> 21:29.244
the Jones family. He and Edsel Jones, his 
brother-in-law, were buying some of that land

21:29.264 --> 21:34.070
together. Have any idea when that was? No, sir, I 
really don't. Early 50s, maybe? Probably. And did

21:41.420 --> 21:42.701
he... No, it probably... I wasn't here in the early 
50s, so... Now, when did you come back to work? uh

21:51.809 --> 22:19.268
august of 58 58 might have been later at 50s okay i'm 
not real sure did he uh put cattle on that land

21:51.809 --> 22:19.268
quickly i think i think he did uh again uh dr butler 
what were some things that he did not want someone

21:51.809 --> 22:19.268
in the office staff to do what were some guidelines 
y'all knew never

21:51.809 --> 22:19.268
really had any problem with that i don't think 
because I always decided, you know, that I was

22:20.362 --> 22:25.049
going to be at work when I was supposed to be at work. 
But like, did he allow people to smoke in the

22:25.630 --> 22:28.314
office? Could you drink coffee? We probably would 
drink coffee, but I don't remember anybody

22:30.877 --> 22:33.241
smoking.

22:36.466 --> 22:46.140
And the Dean of Agriculture, when you came back to 
work in the late 50s, who, that was Dr. Watkins, Gus

22:36.466 --> 22:46.140
Watkins. Dr. Watkins, one of the Dean very long, so 
I didn't have much contact with him. Dr.

22:53.350 --> 22:57.115
Patterson. Yes, I knew Dr. Patterson. Dr. Kunkel 
came over here as associate director of the

22:59.839 --> 23:12.357
experiment station, and when Dr. Lewis left, Dr. 
Patterson came down and was the super dean, where

22:59.839 --> 23:12.357
we call it vice chancellor now. They were called 
dean, but not, and he would, Dr. Patterson said he

23:13.180 --> 23:19.711
wasn't a dean like these other deans here on 
campus. In fact, he didn't want his picture hung

23:20.512 --> 23:24.979
out here with them. He was on the other side. 
Because he was both dean and director. And

23:28.786 --> 23:31.951
director of the Experiment Station over the 
Extension Service. Now, for you at the

23:32.933 --> 23:36.218
departmental level, in the animal science, did 
that super dean task complicate your job? See I

23:42.790 --> 23:45.996
came over here soon after he was super dean. Dr. 
Kunkel came in December of 62 and I came in March of

23:46.016 --> 23:52.025
63. So I didn't have much time. For whom did you 
work? When I came over here, Dr. Kunkel first as

23:57.342 --> 24:00.710
associate director. Make believe I don't know 
Harry Kunkel. Tell me about Harry Kunkel. Well,

24:05.300 --> 24:11.373
Dr. Kunkel, of course, was a professor in animal 
science and biochemistry and biophysics. And Dr.

24:12.596 --> 24:17.106
Patterson chose him to be associate director. So 
he called me one day, I guess around March, before

24:17.862 --> 24:29.258
March, and asked me to bring something over here, 
this building, and I was going to send a runner. And

24:29.799 --> 24:31.381
he told me, no, come yourself. So I came over, and he 
said, how would you like to work over here? And Dr.

24:36.748 --> 24:43.658
Butler said that the one he used to be over now was 
over him and was taking his secretary. Uh-oh,

24:44.139 --> 24:45.220
uh-oh. And so I came over here at that time.

24:51.737 --> 24:52.758
Describe your duties. When I came over here, Dr. 
Patterson was letting Dr. Kunkel pretty much run

24:53.478 --> 25:02.746
the experiment station, you know, the experiment 
station budgets. And we used to, while we have more

25:02.966 --> 25:15.797
people now, we would get the contracts and check 
those out, write the letters, and they would be

25:02.966 --> 25:15.797
signing the contracts and grants And this office 
has changed a lot. We used to have the project

25:18.726 --> 25:21.870
records over on the other side. About how many, how 
large was the staff in the office when you first

25:22.651 --> 25:27.317
came over? Not very large. Maybe 10 or so, I don't 
know. We had human resources with one man and one,

25:39.520 --> 26:05.916
lady and you were located in this area i was right up 
right out here um so on the south end of and everyone

25:39.520 --> 26:05.916
called it the system building right uh and uh 
parking was still simple right right um where did

25:39.520 --> 26:05.916
y'all eat lunch then still i guess we're bringing 
our lunch i didn't go anywhere usually at lunch

26:06.082 --> 26:11.248
Well, at the time, when my husband came back, I used 
to drive down to the restaurant and eat there at

26:06.082 --> 26:11.248
lunch. Now, what was the name of the restaurant? 
Sam's Luncheonette. Where was it located? At

26:16.193 --> 26:28.126
first, it was on Main Street where they took out a 
lot of buildings, several buildings, and had

26:16.193 --> 26:28.126
Woolworth Building, but he was next to First 
National Bank to start with. Now, his family, when

26:30.589 --> 26:34.333
did they first come to Brazos County? early this 
century? Yes, sir, I would say so. And what about

26:38.176 --> 26:39.116
your family? My family lived at Edge. No, but how 
many generations? When did the... I'm not sure.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.545
Did your grandparents live out there? My 
grandparents did, but their parents, I think,

26:49.166 --> 26:54.971
came from Tennessee or Kentucky.

26:57.694 --> 27:04.540
Back over here, describe Dean Kunkel's 
personality.

27:06.393 --> 27:08.014
Sense of humor? I think he has a sense of humor. And 
when did he get married? You said that O.D. teased

27:17.462 --> 27:20.985
him about getting... Well, you know... Was he 
married? It was probably around 59. Okay, that's

27:22.607 --> 27:23.908
what I... I think 59. I thought so. Now, he's an 
Aggie, had lived in one of the project houses, grew

27:25.869 --> 27:33.256
up... Is he from Warda? I know George Kunze... No, 
sir, he's not. He's from Arnie. Oh, that's right,

27:36.413 --> 27:39.162
that's right, out on the high plains. But of 
German... German descent. German descent.

27:44.901 --> 27:48.533
The... And you say that he... Day to day, he ran the 
experiment station. And Dr. Patterson, was his

27:54.207 --> 27:57.550
office located in this area? Yes, sir, on the other 
side, right across the hall over there, where the

27:57.670 --> 28:02.115
secretaries are now. What was his specialty, Dr. 
Patterson's? He was a geneticist. Geneticist.

28:07.320 --> 28:18.030
And this says that he was here until 1967.

28:18.517 --> 28:43.613
about the time you came back to work a man named Earl 
Rudder came as president do you remember when you

28:18.517 --> 28:43.613
first saw him or met him or anything I remember 
mostly the name and being in a meeting where he

28:18.517 --> 28:43.613
spoke and but I didn't have any you know really 
contacts

28:18.517 --> 28:43.613
with My contacts were with Dean and Director of the 
Experiment Station, mainly. Did you ever have any

28:50.086 --> 28:52.549
contact, though, with his office staff? Yes, 
some. Who? Nelda? Jerry Hunt. Jerry Hunt, uh-huh.

28:58.958 --> 29:00.059
I believe Jerry Hunt was there. Describe Jerry. 
Well, I remember she was very involved in working

29:03.384 --> 29:12.216
for Mr. Rutter, and I've heard tell that Lesters, 
who was a... The store sent her dresses to try on

29:12.550 --> 29:17.636
that she didn't have to go. But I think she was, her 
time was pretty much taken without Mr. Rutter. Did

29:24.825 --> 29:29.972
you see Mr. Rutter moving around this building and 
around the campus much? No, sir, I didn't. I

29:32.755 --> 29:34.778
believe he may have moved upstairs, though. You 
know, the president's office used to be on the

29:35.759 --> 29:39.624
second floor of this building. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
but I'm lost on just the timing of that. The

29:47.956 --> 29:55.926
agriculture program during the 60s, did you feel 
it was growing, making progress? Oh, yes, sir. I

29:57.408 --> 30:03.516
have brought you something Dr. Kunkel, while he 
was a super dean, and he did this report, so I

30:04.458 --> 30:09.804
thought you might be interested in some of the 
things that happened during that time.

30:10.044 --> 30:16.652
Enrollments and budgets and things that came into 
being for the first time. The research and

30:17.292 --> 30:20.576
extension centers that were built during that 
time. And I don't think there's been any other

30:21.237 --> 30:28.525
added since those years when they really, 
research and extension centers were built. Did

30:32.328 --> 30:37.156
those of you in agriculture in the 60s, did you all 
feel progress was being made? Yes, I think so. And

30:40.141 --> 30:43.266
there was growth and so forth. We got enrollment 
growth and ranking right up with the top.

30:51.439 --> 30:56.267
Do you remember any fun events, humor? Christmas 
parties, birthday parties, what? I know we had

31:02.437 --> 31:05.601
them, but I don't remember any special events, I 
don't think. Don't remember any electricity

31:06.381 --> 31:08.524
going off? No. Somebody forgetting their speech 
or anything like that? Do you remember when Mr.

31:14.089 --> 31:17.212
Rutter became ill?

31:20.876 --> 31:24.600
I remember him lying in state out here in Rotunda.
