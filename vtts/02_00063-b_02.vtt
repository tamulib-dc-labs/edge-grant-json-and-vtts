WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:06.760
two or three years or something, from Spain. And he 
would have a question or some sample material that

00:09.085 --> 00:13.615
he wanted us to analyze. And the last time he 
called, they had selected a bentonite to use in

00:14.958 --> 00:21.533
their nuclear waste science and he said this is a 
spanish bentonite but it doesn't have the

00:22.289 --> 00:47.352
colloidal properties that your miami bentonite 
has and we don't know if we dare use it or not and he

00:22.289 --> 00:47.352
said it and we analyzed it and told him why it wasn't 
colloidal it had the chemical properties of

00:22.289 --> 00:47.352
bentonite but it didn't have the physical 
properties and the reason was that the tiny little

00:48.175 --> 01:06.032
crystals of clay had not been fully dispersed and 
they were present in little little lumps of

00:48.175 --> 01:06.032
actually silt-sized lumps which is still pretty 
small And they didn't behave colloidally, and it

01:06.012 --> 01:11.403
should serve their purpose very well. And 
actually, we use that example in this book that

01:12.224 --> 01:18.897
we're now putting out. So it turned out to be a 
research contribution as well as a... And he, as I

01:18.917 --> 01:27.514
say, was a civil engineer. and other good civil 
engineering students. The best, probably the

01:33.402 --> 01:45.258
best one that I should remember from my own 
professional point of view is Douglas Darrell

01:33.402 --> 01:45.258
Schultz. Darrell Schultz was from downtown, 
small town between here and Houston, German

01:45.879 --> 01:54.531
community down there. And Darryl was in the Corps. 
And I used to hire undergraduates and still like to

02:00.174 --> 02:05.199
hire undergraduates to work with us some. And he 
worked with us some in the lab when he was in the

02:06.300 --> 02:14.187
Corps and come in and had his uniform on from time to 
time. And finally, he decided, well, he'd do his

02:15.588 --> 02:18.111
master's degree. And I told him, that's fine. I 
have a friend in Germany. whom I had developed a

02:25.797 --> 02:40.985
working relationship through this book 
publishing cycle that I'd gotten into, Udo

02:25.797 --> 02:40.985
Svirtman, and I said, he'd probably be glad to have 
you come over and work something with him. And so he

02:42.407 --> 02:48.278
did, and he was the first in our lab to use the magnet 
to take iron compounds out of soil. And we knew this

02:53.447 --> 02:58.135
process had been developed, but we hadn't brought 
it down to a laboratory scale. He used a magnet over

02:59.076 --> 03:01.921
in engineering, actually, to do that. And Darrell 
Schultz then applied and received a von Humboldt

03:02.782 --> 03:15.362
scholarship and went to Germany and worked with my 
colleague Schwertmann and got his doctor's

03:02.782 --> 03:15.362
degree there. And he's on the faculty at Purdue 
University and has been there for several years

03:16.287 --> 03:23.958
and has been very successful there. And he and I are 
co-editors on this last book, which is

03:24.839 --> 03:30.748
gratifying. Of all the students you've had, 
reckon what percentage are in academia, what

03:31.068 --> 03:41.603
percentage are in government, what percentage 
are out in private industry? They're scattered

03:43.405 --> 03:46.169
throughout the three different areas. I guess 
academia would maybe have a slight edge. Some are

03:54.562 --> 03:56.145
consultants. Just last week I called Hugh Durham, 
and Hugh got his master's here. He's a South Texas

04:02.655 --> 04:09.025
boy and married a young Greek lady when he was in the 
military. And they were here, and his children

04:09.646 --> 04:18.460
were small, and he was pressed by finances and 
didn't get a PhD, and went with a clay company in

04:09.646 --> 04:18.460
Georgia. And now he's in Gonzales with the 
Southern Clay Products Company, and he's

04:19.201 --> 04:27.614
marketing clay products for them. And I called him 
last week and talked to him, and he was in Memphis,

04:28.475 --> 04:36.868
north of Memphis, when I caught him in the car over 
there.

04:38.958 --> 04:41.000
For a master's student, he's done well. And down 
through the years, could you tell much difference

04:42.641 --> 04:54.652
between the preparation, once they were in your 
class, of the engineers, the geoscientists, the

04:42.641 --> 04:54.652
ag people? Was there much difference between how 
capable they were to do the work in their course?

05:03.860 --> 05:08.965
They tend to have a better developed background 
mathematically. in engineering. And they tend to

05:11.018 --> 05:15.169
have a better background chemically in soil 
science. And those are the main differences. And

05:20.082 --> 05:21.486
as time goes on, They blend, but in general, it's 
pretty hard for people who never, engineers are

05:21.635 --> 05:31.565
taught chemistry, but they don't use it day to day 
like we have to use it. And therefore, that's kind

05:31.585 --> 05:35.810
of a hurdle that they have to gradually work over. 
But the beauty of this course, like I had a student

05:36.610 --> 05:47.001
from India who was in civil engineering. He was a 
real promoter for the course. He recruited

05:51.706 --> 05:54.349
students from us over there. And he's now, I think, 
with a consulting firm. But he was really a spark

06:00.996 --> 06:04.620
plug at whatever he did. And it was because he could 
see through this. And our ultimate customer is

06:11.407 --> 06:16.532
really the public. And he was one who saw the full 
breadth of that. And he had to do very engineering

06:21.952 --> 06:31.041
type of work when he was here and worked quite a lot 
with me mineralogically and with my research

06:21.952 --> 06:31.041
associate. But when he got over there, he had to 
apply it in a totally different way to highway

06:31.702 --> 06:40.310
instability and things like that. But he went out 
then. to serve in the public. And he's the second

06:46.499 --> 06:54.429
engineer that I've had that had an international 
background who went out, the first one went with a

06:46.499 --> 06:54.429
state highway. And these, my point is that we can't 
very often get a chance to help much with roads and

06:54.449 --> 07:05.503
foundations because our research is not We're not 
tied as closely to that. But these students, they

07:09.391 --> 07:12.697
take this right out into the field. And so that's 
among the more gratifying experience I've had

07:13.378 --> 07:26.985
with students, realizing that Texas is plagued 
with millions of acres of very reactive clay

07:13.378 --> 07:26.985
soils. And, you know, if you drive the streets of 
this community, you know that painfully. Well,

07:32.669 --> 07:43.675
even today I was talking with one of my colleagues 
in Extension about how we could do something to

07:32.669 --> 07:43.675
help handle the urban scene, not just the rural 
scene, but the urban scene. as to how to better

07:43.857 --> 07:51.530
utilize these soils and stabilize them and get the 
water to flow where it should and not where it does.

07:52.311 --> 08:01.326
And being able to work with this diverse group has 
permitted us to reach out quite a bit to them. In

08:01.346 --> 08:09.460
these students and their effort, I have the 
impression that Asian students are extremely

08:01.346 --> 08:09.460
diligent. Can you generalize about the diligence 
of students by their background? Just their

08:15.365 --> 08:17.748
determination, their effort? It is true that the 
Asian students do tend to be very diligent. At the

08:23.895 --> 08:30.544
Masters and PhD level, the students in general are 
more motivated. So having to prod students is not

08:30.904 --> 08:36.932
our usual circumstance.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.578
Now, there's a lot of difference. I've had not many 
students from Japan, although I've had a few, but

08:39.059 --> 08:45.990
I've had some postdocs from Japan. And they are 
very methodical, and they can work on the most

08:47.012 --> 09:02.937
ragged problem, and their consistency and 
persistence they can deal with. whereas

09:03.845 --> 09:06.469
Americans would probably not have the patience. 
But coming up as they have, and as it happens,

09:08.131 --> 09:16.343
Japanese soils are volcanic soils, very 
disorderly and very difficult to deal with. They

09:18.085 --> 09:26.597
made progress, and I've had the privilege of 
working with three different Japanese. Have you

09:27.899 --> 09:30.122
ever had any... events that obviously showed some 
kind of awkwardness between some students

09:31.351 --> 09:43.512
because of their, the history of their countries. 
A student from Greece and Turkey working side by

09:44.914 --> 09:55.452
side or Korea and Japan working side, any of that 
ever? I've thought about that many times, and

09:57.068 --> 10:01.795
that's really a rare thing. I had a student came in 
from South Africa, actually, he was a postdoc

10:01.935 --> 10:06.923
here. And he said when he got here, he said, you 
know, it was quite an experience to come from South

10:07.644 --> 10:17.518
Africa and come in through South America. Said we 
kind of went from the black to the brown. He said,

10:22.853 --> 10:25.478
that was really a jolt to my wife and I. And he was not 
prejudiced. He was a white child. Yes, he was

10:29.826 --> 10:32.090
white. And he was very diligent, very capable, 
very efficient. And it wasn't long until Abu

10:37.520 --> 10:46.397
Sinkai from Uganda, who's very African, They were 
just exchanging views. And so it's sort of a

10:50.887 --> 10:58.457
mystery to me that people have trouble that they do 
when I see these guys working together. What about

10:58.818 --> 11:14.680
any awkwardness of male-female, a Muslim, a woman 
from a Muslim background dressing in a fashion

10:58.818 --> 11:14.680
that might not be acceptable back home or 
something or other? I don't believe I've had a

11:14.913 --> 11:18.336
Muslim woman. I remember when I went to Saudi 
Arabia and I met my friends from over there. They

11:24.583 --> 11:27.706
came out in their white attire. And I just 
commented, you know, all this grand welcoming

11:28.887 --> 11:35.193
beginning and all this workshop we were going to 
have. They had brought in people from all the

11:35.253 --> 11:43.401
neighboring Arab countries, which I found later 
they had to pay their way to get them to come. And I

11:44.528 --> 11:51.322
just said privately at lunch or something, it's a 
mysterious thing I've observed here. You all have

11:51.342 --> 11:57.475
such a, Riyadh is growing and thriving, and yet 
there are no women. I just don't know how you've

11:58.357 --> 12:00.782
managed all this. They sure didn't come back with 
any quick

12:01.741 --> 12:06.706
answers. But even then I could see these young 
ladies that they were beginning to educate with

12:06.726 --> 12:16.757
their briefcases and going to the record shops and 
that music and things. But I haven't had any, I've

12:18.118 --> 12:28.609
had, now I did have a young woman, now that you 
mention that, The poorest country neighbor to

12:28.589 --> 12:33.851
India on the east. It's in the wetlands. I think 
it's Bangladesh. She was my class, and she's

12:41.243 --> 12:43.907
Muslim. But she said, when I discussed that type of 
thing with her privately, she said, well, when I

12:44.308 --> 13:01.132
first came, I wore my attire one day, but said, you 
know, it seemed to be sort of a problem, so I haven't

12:44.308 --> 13:01.132
been wearing it anymore. Her father was a civil 
engineer. And they were actually originally from

13:05.022 --> 13:11.311
India, I think, and they were working in that part 
of the world. But she was very bright and very

13:12.032 --> 13:17.721
capable and did well in the course. So I was 
pleased, because I've always had a particular

13:19.223 --> 13:25.532
empathy for the women in that part of the world. 
Have you ever had any student of any sort give you

13:29.930 --> 13:40.801
some kind of hokum kind of excuse that they can't do 
something or other because of, or they need

13:29.930 --> 13:40.801
special consideration because of? I had a 
sabbatical person from Egypt who was devout, is

13:40.821 --> 13:47.769
devout Muslim. And the thing that he did that I, he 
didn't press this on us, but every so many times a

13:48.650 --> 13:56.798
day, he rolled out his mat and did his prayers in the 
laboratory. Oh, so he really did. And I made a point

14:04.850 --> 14:12.601
not to go into the laboratory when he was prayer 
time for him. But he combined the two. He was highly

14:16.247 --> 14:19.932
motivated in his religion. He worked as hard as any 
man I've ever known and did a lot of good work. But he

14:25.381 --> 14:31.489
was the most orthodox person I think I've ever 
worked with. Very pleasant, but he drew the line.

14:35.202 --> 14:37.125
All right, this is to the typist. This is not an 
editorial note and you don't need to include it in

14:37.225 --> 14:42.434
the typed version. The best excuse I've ever 
gotten as an example of goofiness was from an Aggie

14:42.874 --> 14:57.358
who told me that his first day, his freshman 
course, his grandfather was really sick and that

14:42.874 --> 14:57.358
he might not make it through the semester. And I 
said, you're not teasing? He said, no, it's really

14:59.061 --> 15:01.024
serious. I said, well, gee, I hope it's not 
terminal. He said, oh, yeah, yeah, he's probably

15:03.187 --> 15:06.511
not going to make it. I said, well, keep me informed 
and we'll try to do the best we can. He was still

15:12.379 --> 15:14.322
serious, or so it looked. And when he got to the 
door, he turned his back to me and he said, in fact,

15:14.362 --> 15:21.612
sir, it's almost certain he's going to die the 
first day of deer season. So I use that as my best

15:23.515 --> 15:27.060
example ever. All right, now take me through your 
research. What were you working on when you got

15:32.809 --> 15:34.552
here? And what were your research efforts and 
projects and so forth? It could take a long time. I

15:44.486 --> 15:46.429
don't know how much of that you want.

15:49.254 --> 15:51.497
When I was in Auburn, University in Alabama, we 
were defining soils. We were analyzing samples of

15:59.367 --> 16:03.071
soils that had never been analyzed. And we had a new 
x-ray machine, and we were just getting these

16:03.792 --> 16:08.398
basic data. And so that was the focus of what we did. 
Excuse me a moment. I guess I'll take this off. Or

16:18.871 --> 16:19.392
should I?

16:23.455 --> 16:34.764
When I came to Texas, Kunze had done quite a lot of 
characterization of the mineralogy of Texas

16:23.455 --> 16:34.764
soils. He's always done some more, but he had 
studied samples of the Houston Black, which is the

16:34.785 --> 16:50.157
state soil, and the Lufkin, which is a local soil, 
and the Beaumont, which is an acid soil they grow

16:34.785 --> 16:50.157
rice on. He had done the general mineralogy of 
them. reasonably well, and he was very

16:53.898 --> 16:57.504
methodical. He always had a good technician, and 
they did things very methodically, and so I had

16:57.605 --> 17:12.471
files of data, and have often gone back and pulled 
those out and compared, and that's been very

16:57.605 --> 17:12.471
effective. So I began to look for other things. The 
space era and the environmental eras have been

17:18.535 --> 17:28.028
factors that have influenced us. I had a student, 
David Carty, who came in as

17:28.969 --> 17:38.923
an undergraduate, and he wanted to do a a problem 
with library kind of study on how to contain a

17:39.359 --> 17:53.980
nuclear explosion out of a generating plant. Now, 
this is a long way back. We were still way back in the

17:55.422 --> 18:04.995
old State Chemist's Building, and a whole lot of 
things have happened in the country since then,

17:55.422 --> 18:04.995
and nobody had witnessed stuff. a nuclear event. 
And whenever we made contact, and David did this as

18:06.871 --> 18:24.363
his project, with a nuclear branch of government, 
they not only didn't want to share anything with

18:06.871 --> 18:24.363
him, they sort of scolded him for even asking the 
question. And he he had the idea that, well,

18:28.550 --> 18:45.830
someday there's going to be a meltdown and if we 
study the soils in the area, that we could make a

18:28.550 --> 18:45.830
berm around the site and we could contain whatever 
was there if we chose the soils correctly. And this

18:46.591 --> 18:54.220
would be a significant deterrent to the spreading 
of radioactive materials. As I say, he did what he

18:54.790 --> 18:59.477
could, but it was an unpopular topic. They didn't 
want to talk to him about it. But in the intervening

19:01.721 --> 19:06.468
years, we found out how prophetic his thoughts 
were. He was kind of a radical student, in a sense,

19:06.849 --> 19:10.494
talking about this sort of thing. But we know about 
Three Mile Island. We know about Chernobyl. And we

19:14.973 --> 19:19.638
know that that kind of information is really good 
thinking. And by the way, that young man is a

19:20.239 --> 19:24.684
consultant here in Bryan now. He works out of 
Bryan. So he's still pursuing environmental

19:27.707 --> 19:31.451
problems. So we did work. That was not a very 
in-depth endeavor, but that was one thing.

19:37.238 --> 19:43.765
Another one that comes to mind that's more novel 
than anything else, and that is I had a student who

19:44.403 --> 19:52.011
worked as an undergraduate helping in the lab 
part-time, and he wanted to do some research. And

19:53.052 --> 20:10.630
it had happened there had been a young lady who was 
from the geography department, and she came in one

19:53.052 --> 20:10.630
day and she had about a dozen samples that she had 
picked up while she was touring near Pericatine

19:53.052 --> 20:10.630
Volcano in Mexico.

20:11.943 --> 20:14.608
She said, the crop's doing terrible there. These 
people can grow a good crop of corn. What's the

20:19.175 --> 20:19.977
problem? And she said, here are these samples. 
Well, you look at them and tell me about it. Well, I

20:25.566 --> 20:36.685
felt very humbled at that point because I didn't 
have any idea that I could do much looking at those

20:25.566 --> 20:36.685
samples to tell her why the corn didn't grow well in 
Pericotine. But she left them and she told me she

20:37.070 --> 20:41.237
would check back. And so I told this young man who 
was working with me, I said, now you want to do a

20:42.158 --> 21:00.748
piece of research, and we're doing soil 
mineralogy, would you take the clay out of those 12

20:42.158 --> 21:00.748
samples and we'll x-ray it and see what it is?

21:02.382 --> 21:02.843
He did. And we x-rayed them and it was the poorest 
set of x-ray patterns I think I ever saw. Out of the

21:09.351 --> 21:13.456
whole set we had two that had some small peaks on 
them. The others were just lines, just jiggle

21:13.476 --> 21:15.659
lines. Those days we had long strip charts. And 
that was, well, then came a student from

21:18.783 --> 21:28.355
oceanography, Tom McKee. And Tom really liked to 
work with electron microscopes. And that, he came

21:34.395 --> 21:39.043
to me because he thought I could use it for the 
electron mic work. And so he took those and looked

21:40.666 --> 21:55.710
at them, and that was before the, I believe it was 
the 10th

21:40.666 --> 21:55.710
International Soil Congress in Moscow. And Tom 
McKee looked at those little glass particles,

21:57.260 --> 22:08.400
which is mostly what those soils were, volcanic 
glass, and found little spots in them which we

22:08.752 --> 22:20.850
realized were hallucite, a particular kind of 
clay that forms in many soils and in volcanic soils

22:08.752 --> 22:20.850
particularly. And then we went to the other 
instruments, infrared and so on, and

22:20.870 --> 22:28.562
characterized what they were further. And I gave 
that paper in Moscow and it's published in the

22:29.683 --> 22:38.016
proceedings of that conference. From that, we had 
analyzed some soil from Guatemala. There's an

22:43.165 --> 23:02.080
aggie from Guatemala who used to come here every 
year because he had children in school here, and he

22:43.165 --> 23:02.080
would bring some samples with him, and he again 
would ask me questions like, I want to know if this

22:43.165 --> 23:02.080
will make good soil for growing tomatoes, which I 
wasn't exactly the person that should have been

23:02.684 --> 23:07.659
handling that kind of question. But he would also, 
in his position as an alumnus, he would leave me the

23:08.100 --> 23:15.883
samples and he'll say, all right, you send me the 
results. And Dr. Bloodworth, that's the only time

23:16.808 --> 23:26.278
that I can remember Dr. Bloodworth saying, would 
you like to meet this gentleman and help him out?

23:26.879 --> 23:28.100
And so and so I did. And we had found this one soil 
that had a lot of aloesite in it from Guatemala,

23:28.140 --> 23:38.372
volcanic soil. Well, some of it was spherical. And 
clays are making up of layers, and there's, if you

23:42.374 --> 23:51.545
distort a layer, it tends to roll and make a 
cylinder. And most all the holosite in the world

23:52.066 --> 23:58.293
that we knew about in those days was tubular. And 
here we found spheres. And so the clave scientists

24:02.298 --> 24:07.825
from all around wanted to know why spheres. In the 
glass from pericotine, we saw these spheres

24:08.918 --> 24:19.837
forming in bubbles at the microscopic level, at 
the micron level. And no one has ever refuted that,

24:19.857 --> 24:25.527
and that grew out of the undergraduate student's 
inquiry, the lady, the geography student

24:26.300 --> 24:41.345
bringing the sample from Mexico, and then I went 
later to the pericotine and sampled the soil again

24:26.300 --> 24:41.345
when I was in there. So that was, those were kind of 
isolated parts of research. But those were

24:46.754 --> 24:52.864
projects that you got involved in as a result of the 
student. Right. But what were your pet projects

24:53.545 --> 24:59.614
when you got here and how did they, what else, what 
did that lead to?

25:03.880 --> 25:13.975
Well, the history of clay mineralogy and soils for 
quite a long time was potassium chemistry. We all

25:15.254 --> 25:18.378
know that you've got nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
potassium. That's what the gardener puts on and

25:18.418 --> 25:22.083
makes fertilizer. So potassium, there's a lot of 
it applied. It's an expensive fertilizer

25:25.247 --> 25:28.912
amendment. And clays have potassium in the 
structure in some cases. And so we were always

25:35.881 --> 25:39.726
trying to figure out why some clays held why does 
the Houston black clay hold potassium

25:40.516 --> 25:45.834
effectively, or why it releases it? Well,

25:46.556 --> 25:53.479
that work was really the what we were pursuing 
whenever I mentioned Frank Hans earlier, that's

25:54.235 --> 26:01.225
the way that turned out up there. That the shortage 
of potassium was what they were trying to deal

26:01.826 --> 26:19.011
with, and the soil test would say they needed to 
apply soil potassium fertilizer, but the plant

26:01.826 --> 26:19.011
didn't respond that way. And in his work, we found 
that, well, there is enough mica in a certain

26:19.193 --> 26:30.027
fraction of that soil that it is releasing some 
potassium. And so that correlated with the

26:30.047 --> 26:34.173
available potassium to the plant. And we 
published that work. So that was one of my areas of

26:36.195 --> 26:45.127
interest, a subject much worked on by many soil 
scientists. What was next?

26:49.113 --> 26:53.721
Well, a lot of things that come to us in research are 
kind of coincidental. I was and am interested in

26:53.882 --> 27:10.952
iron oxides, and whenever I got to using the new 
microscope here, and growing out of Daryl

26:53.882 --> 27:10.952
Schultz's work to some degree, we had the tools to 
deal with iron oxides. And in this regional

27:11.422 --> 27:14.505
project, we want to deal with them. One of the basic 
problems with soils is that they may be chemically

27:14.525 --> 27:23.993
controlled reasonably well, but we cannot 
physically control them very well. And that is

27:24.614 --> 27:29.238
still a persistent problem, as we mentioned 
earlier. And so I wanted to analyze the iron oxides

27:30.079 --> 27:41.209
in some of the soils from the states and the 
regional group, as well as in Texas, and see what

27:41.662 --> 27:49.083
what there was about them that made the soil behave 
differently when we have quite a lot of iron oxide

27:41.662 --> 27:49.083
in them. The two major aggregating agents in soils 
are iron oxides and organic matter. being a

27:57.490 --> 28:00.294
mineralogist, I was looking at the iron oxide. 
After all, the red clays of Georgia are rather

28:00.314 --> 28:05.401
well-structured. And many of the red soils of the 
southeastern United States, they're rather

28:05.761 --> 28:10.688
well-structured. But the gray soils of Texas are 
not very well-structured. And so I began to look at

28:15.214 --> 28:16.656
them. And from that, I realized with the 
instrument that we have that While clays in soil,

28:24.170 --> 28:29.417
again, they're layered, they tend to be smooth. 
And there's not much friction between layered

28:30.619 --> 28:38.150
structures, graphite, clay, and so on. But these 
iron oxides are like little cockleburs or

28:38.851 --> 28:46.802
something, only they're little crystal ends. And 
even within the last few weeks, I've had to correct

28:46.782 --> 28:56.519
my Midwestern colleagues who said there are no 
crystal faces on iron oxides. They think that

28:56.539 --> 28:58.983
they're disorganized. But only when you magnify 
them about a third of a million times or more can you

28:59.003 --> 29:12.165
realize that really they're composed of numerous 
little crystal faces that are some micron in size.

29:13.495 --> 29:18.482
That's, one would never know that without good 
instrumentation. And so I think that's a

29:18.502 --> 29:20.865
significant finding. And I teach it now. So iron 
oxides. I got interested while I was on

29:28.115 --> 29:30.318
sabbatical. There was a young woman, Shirley 
Turner, a slightly deformed young lady. sort of a

29:39.331 --> 29:44.737
strange structural deal, but a very good 
scientist. And she was working on manganese

29:45.699 --> 29:56.151
oxides, and this was a geology group that I was 
associated with, and she did a very nice

29:45.699 --> 29:56.151
dissertation on manganese oxides. So when I came 
back from sabbatical, I got a copy of her

29:56.171 --> 30:08.005
dissertation, and then I began to look, and a lot of 
these soils in Texas have little black nodules in

29:56.171 --> 30:08.005
them which are manganese oxide. And so I started 
characterizing those. And she brought me into

30:14.193 --> 30:24.462
contact with the electron microscopic 
techniques for doing that, and which I, of course,

30:14.193 --> 30:24.462
learned, studied there. So in our work with 
reclamation, which is, I worked about 10 years

30:25.523 --> 30:39.055
collaboratively with Lloyd Hosner, who's a soil 
chemist, and some other people, and had

30:25.523 --> 30:39.055
sabbatical people come in And we worked about how 
to convert overburden into soil, and what would be

30:39.406 --> 30:47.619
good and what would be bad. And one of the things 
that we found in that was that there are these black

30:48.560 --> 31:01.981
coatings on some of the rock that were exposed by 
mining. And we identified that as toterokite,

31:08.532 --> 31:10.088
manganese oxide that was
