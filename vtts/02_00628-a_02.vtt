WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:06.180
And we almost picked her back up within a month, but 
the weather got bad. Where was this? This was right

00:07.601 --> 00:12.706
south of here, about 125 miles, something like 
that. 4,500 feet of water. Gee whiz. Yeah, so the

00:16.290 --> 00:20.594
next year they went back and picked her up, brought 
her in, and refurbished her. Alvin's like

00:21.775 --> 00:26.279
grandfather's ax, three new heads and four new 
handles, but it's still a good ax. You

00:26.319 --> 00:29.903
know, she's... They have a new hole in her now, a 
titanium hole, so she can go to 12,000 feet. Right.

00:35.892 --> 00:37.355
That was the next question I was going to ask you. 
Her original depth was 6,000 feet, and there was

00:37.916 --> 00:44.950
some criticism about the fact this wasn't deep 
enough to do things like the Atlanta Church. Yeah,

00:44.970 --> 00:45.230
right. That's true. Actually, we sort of... Well, 
people are often too conservative because...

00:53.086 --> 01:12.032
Those spheres turned out we could have gone to 15, 
well, we probably could have gone to 12,000 feet in

00:53.086 --> 01:12.032
those spheres with a safety factor of one and a 
quarter to one and a third, because it looked like

00:53.086 --> 01:12.032
all the tests showed that they would be good to 
15,000 or 16,000 feet before they collapsed. We

01:12.053 --> 01:19.583
took them down to, one of them we were going to test 
and collapse in Southwest Research, and we took it

01:12.053 --> 01:19.583
down there and the tank blew up instead of, The top 
blew off the tank. So that ended that test. We just,

01:25.076 --> 01:27.719
from then on, knew we had something that was good. 
We never could quite shake loose the 6,000-foot

01:28.580 --> 01:32.283
mark. We could have gone deeper. We'd had to change 
the variable balance system, though. That was one

01:37.548 --> 01:38.829
major change. If we really wanted to go much 
deeper, we'd have had to do it. That's the pump that

01:42.112 --> 01:44.954
pumps water in and out to keep your trim right. And 
it would have worked about 7,500 feet, and that

01:46.235 --> 01:49.418
would have been the limit. So that would have been 
it. Yeah, the Neuse Hall works fine. One of those is

01:57.180 --> 02:01.945
the sister hall has been tested to something like 
22,000 feet, you see. So we're back again being

02:02.947 --> 02:05.990
very super cautious. And with a submarine where 
you're bottom limited. I mean, if you don't go in

02:10.416 --> 02:18.105
water that's deeper than your, that's a little bit 
more shallow than your crush depth, you're in

02:10.416 --> 02:18.105
pretty good shape. unless there's an atomic 
explosion or something like that. In that case, it

02:21.876 --> 02:26.242
really doesn't make any sense. That's right. Then 
I think the Alvin will not be our primary concern.

02:28.805 --> 02:35.753
It won't be our primary concern,

02:28.805 --> 02:35.753
that's right. But it's really this 12,000 feet 
expansion that allows them to do the work that

02:35.873 --> 02:42.121
helps to verify deep sea spreading. Right, and 
then they get into the rifts and the valleys and so

02:42.141 --> 02:45.024
on. Now, you can't, you know, there's always a 
deeper place to go. Yeah. 15,000 feet would be

02:48.697 --> 02:51.941
better than 12,000 feet. A lot of the ocean is 
15,000 feet, you know, 5,000 meters deep. And

02:57.609 --> 03:02.115
12,000 feet doesn't get you to a lot of the flat 
places in the ocean. Of course, in some way,

03:02.736 --> 03:09.064
they're not as interesting

03:02.736 --> 03:09.064
as the places where it's wiggly. Of course, in the 
valleys and the deeps, why, you have to go much

03:09.084 --> 03:15.152
deeper. So it doesn't make much difference. Okay. 
So now, then, after your work on the Alvin, next

03:18.197 --> 03:25.225
year then, chairman of the department, right? 
Yeah. Okay. Well, I was chairman, yeah, that's

03:26.646 --> 03:29.029
basically it. In 62, I guess, we formed the 
department. Now, so, what sort of new ideas did you

03:31.812 --> 03:35.997
try to bring into the department in 62? Oh, 
actually, I didn't really try to do much at all.

03:42.244 --> 03:43.866
Well, we got into the computer business. We didn't 
have a really big computer. So in between 62 and 66

03:47.786 --> 03:51.951
we got into the computer business. We had to hire 
people and get the computer system set up and get a

03:52.952 --> 03:57.177
computer. And we changed computers once from a 
GE-225 to a Sigma-7. That was a, you know, that's

04:04.206 --> 04:06.949
another busy work. It's fairly straightforward, 
but it takes lots of time to do things like that.

04:10.692 --> 04:12.154
reasonably important to the department. Right. 
Well, to the whole institution. Yeah, right. See,

04:14.496 --> 04:16.619
this is the whole institution. The other thing we 
did, we got into chipboard computers and computer

04:16.659 --> 04:28.993
systems to use on our ships, which was really 
started by Carl Bowen here. He was the first person

04:29.794 --> 04:33.319
to really, well, that may not quite be true. I think 
Rocky Miller was one of the first to put a computer

04:34.039 --> 04:38.605
on a ship, too. I don't quite remember the dates. To 
have a thing that was sort of a standard piece of the

04:41.000 --> 04:47.887
ship's operating gear is now the way we operate. 
It's unusual for the ships to go out without one of

04:49.508 --> 04:53.892
our HP 2100s on it. They're all operated through 
the department. Do you have any prior experience

04:57.516 --> 04:59.638
in computers? No. So then what you're looking for 
is a computer man, so to speak, to bring into your

05:01.119 --> 05:05.043
department. That's what we did, right. That's not 
a problem now, of course, but that's what we were

05:06.344 --> 05:09.167
looking at. But it should have been a problem then. 
It was more of a problem. Well, first we brought in a

05:14.532 --> 05:23.762
guy who was a computer person and not much of a 
manager. He knew computers well, and he knew

05:25.364 --> 05:27.606
programming well. But when you set up an 
organization like that that ends up with 25 to 30

05:27.626 --> 05:36.075
people, the man at the top has to be also a manager. 
It's more important that he knows what you're

05:39.033 --> 05:50.223
trying to do, and how to get people to do things, and 
what people to use and not to use, and have somebody

05:39.033 --> 05:50.223
that knows all about the technology and 
everything else sort of dribbles and goes in

05:39.033 --> 05:50.223
different directions. Yeah, it really is. 
Management's an important thing, and anything

05:53.026 --> 06:01.153
that involves more than 10 or 15 people, I think, 
really becomes important. So it worked well. We

06:03.916 --> 06:08.820
have our Sigma-7, and we have, I think, In the 
institution, there's at least 14 of these HPs, of

06:11.534 --> 06:18.065
which four or five belong to the shipboard 
computer group. And we're continually changing

06:19.106 --> 06:22.311
it because the technology is changing. And it 
seems desirable to keep in step with the

06:22.371 --> 06:28.762
technology and try to keep up with it anyhow. It's 
just like these little hand computers you get

06:29.783 --> 06:32.888
these days, huh? Incredible. Incredible. They 
really are incredible. They really are

06:34.852 --> 06:35.753
incredible. I might have been a scientist if I had 
one of those when I was young. I couldn't pass

06:39.687 --> 06:40.948
physics. I couldn't do the math. So primarily

06:41.869 --> 06:54.823
the transition to the computer then that takes 
place, and the computer goes on the shipboard for

06:41.869 --> 06:54.823
the first time. Were you sort of amazed at the sort 
of data and work the computer could do on the

06:55.283 --> 07:01.690
shipboard, or did you anticipate that? work that a 
computer can do to start with. It doesn't make much

07:04.887 --> 07:08.231
difference whether it's on a ship or not. No, they 
really are amazing things. Yes, they are.

07:11.455 --> 07:16.600
Nowadays, it's just really nifty what people can 
do with them. This changes the whole idea of what

07:16.680 --> 07:19.864
you can do with data. You can look at it, and process 
it, and pull it apart, and look at frequency

07:21.265 --> 07:29.034
spectrum, and everything you want to, and just 
fantastic detail. Really different.

07:35.116 --> 07:37.559
There would, for example, have been no modeling 
with those computers. That would be very

07:37.579 --> 07:38.741
difficult. Well, people did try to model things, 
but they did it analytically with equations,

07:39.241 --> 07:47.032
numerical equations, and things like that. And it 
just took time, lots of time. When you get into

07:49.515 --> 08:04.735
certain integrals that you have to do 
numerically, that you can't get solutions for,

07:49.515 --> 08:04.735
then you have to have lots of people sitting and 
punching calculators and adding little things

07:49.515 --> 08:04.735
and bits together. Wipes out the problem, right? 
Weather modeling or oceanographic modeling, any

08:07.394 --> 08:13.163
of this stuff is based upon the computers. Of 
course, the good ideas are hard to come by. The

08:17.650 --> 08:22.277
original solid ideas of what to do are probably the 
most important thing. And not many people have

08:23.499 --> 08:25.743
those great ideas. And then it takes a long time to 
really prove them or disprove them. I think in any

08:31.091 --> 08:33.034
field this is true.

08:37.891 --> 08:41.676
So were there any particular problems as chairman 
of the department? No, standard people problems.

08:48.366 --> 08:49.988
You have all those all different kinds. No, we 
didn't have any terrible problems that I know of.

08:53.453 --> 08:57.058
At least if they did, they kept them quiet. And then 
after chairmanship of the department? So you were

09:01.925 --> 09:04.168
62 to what, 67? In the applied oceanography, to 66. 
Then I was chairman of the geology and geophysics

09:07.151 --> 09:11.698
team, 66 through 69. And of course, I'd been 
associated with that group before I went into the

09:11.778 --> 09:19.370
submarine business. And I had stayed associated 
with them a reasonable amount during that time. So

09:24.538 --> 09:27.823
it wasn't any big shock to come back to that group. 
OK. Now that anticipates the next question. Has

09:29.566 --> 09:31.489
the group changed or anything that you were Any 
sort of surprises that came to you by the time you

09:31.722 --> 09:35.766
returned back to your original work? No, I don't 
think so. No. We were just doing a lot more. We'd

09:40.331 --> 09:41.091
grown. Don't forget, this is during the period 
I've been here has been the big growth rate of

09:41.692 --> 09:47.638
oceanography. And everything got bigger and 
better. And we went through the big ships. We got

09:53.384 --> 09:58.829
our first big ship chain in 58 or 9, I think it was. 
59, I guess it was. And before that, sort of the

10:01.777 --> 10:11.586
biggest ship we'd use had been the Yamacraw we had 
from the Coast Guard for a year and a half, for two

10:01.777 --> 10:11.586
years. And we were doing our acoustic work from it, 
some cruises into the Mediterranean and back. And

10:19.593 --> 10:29.202
that was a big change for the institution, because 
we started, before they'd run, well, the Atlantis

10:19.593 --> 10:29.202
was the largest ship they had, and it was quite 
small compared to the Just not enough room or not

10:30.042 --> 10:33.907
enough electrical power to do all the things we do 
today.

10:36.991 --> 10:38.232
That was interesting. Then we got chain. Then we 
got Atlantis II. And then eventually NOR came

10:43.299 --> 10:45.702
along. And so the whole picture grew about the 
seagoing capability of the institution. When I

10:52.851 --> 10:56.235
first came here, we had Crawford. which is a 
125-foot Coast Guard cutter, the Bear, which is

10:57.312 --> 11:06.786
about a 70, 80-foot sort of tuggish boat, and the 
Alanis. And then we used the Amicron. That was the

11:11.432 --> 11:23.910
fleet then, but now you see we're operating, well, 
we're connected with Sea Probe now, and we're

11:11.432 --> 11:23.910
connected with NOR, Alanis II, and Oceanis. plus 
salvin and lulut. So our green thing has really

11:25.552 --> 11:27.654
grown. It's enormous. It's a big business.

11:34.582 --> 11:35.963
But no major problems. Well, seafloor spreading, 
the idea of seafloor spreading was starting. And

11:39.868 --> 11:42.230
people were getting interested in that. And the 
definition of the ridges, you know, the hazing

11:42.310 --> 11:49.178
that worked out of the structure of the bottom of 
the earth. We began to see this structure. the ties

11:52.274 --> 11:56.558
together with the seafloor spreading, the 
tectonic motion. It all made an interesting

11:56.578 --> 12:05.728
picture.

12:05.748 --> 12:09.852
And so, and then you remained as chairman of the 
department until? 69. 69, and then? Then I went to

12:13.075 --> 12:19.041
Italy for two years as deputy director of the 
Sackland Center over there. Okay. Tell me about

12:19.911 --> 12:20.551
that. Oh, that was neat. Well, it's a NATO 
organization of, they have a total of about 200

12:23.194 --> 12:30.221
people. And they're called ASW Center, and their 
work is to look at problems in finding submarines

12:31.983 --> 12:39.611
for the NATO countries. And people are there from 
13 different countries, I believe. They have a

12:46.477 --> 12:50.262
staff of 50 scientist posts. And usually nine of 
these are from the United States, and the rest are

12:51.864 --> 12:57.030
from other NATO countries. It's located in La 
Spezia, which is up in the northwest coast of

12:58.272 --> 13:08.966
Italy, just beginning the lovely Cote d'Azur. 
It's a very lovely place to live. And the little

13:12.390 --> 13:15.454
town where we lived was Lerici, and that was nice. a 
different world. You're in a different

13:17.136 --> 13:19.279
environment. It's very interesting. The work is 
good. They do quite good work over there. All the

13:23.846 --> 13:27.671
people are picked out very carefully that go 
there. It's just a heck of an interesting place to

13:27.691 --> 13:29.894
be. How were you chosen as deputy director? What 
was your conduct? Well, just from the work I'd done

13:33.740 --> 13:35.622
with ONR. You know, I knew a lot of people in the 
office. All the people that go there from the U.S.

13:38.466 --> 13:42.071
go through the Office of Naval Research. And of 
course, We'd been doing business with Office of

13:43.058 --> 13:48.143
Naval Research ever since I came to Woods Hole. So I 
knew a lot of the people down there. And they were

13:49.864 --> 13:52.867
looking for a deputy director. And he had to have 
worked in acoustics and know something about

13:52.907 --> 13:58.252
management and things like that. And so I sort of 
fit the bill. And they asked me if I'd like to go. And

14:03.377 --> 14:04.058
I said, sure. Yeah, you bet, huh? Right. So it was 
very nice. And it was a terminal two-year

14:11.712 --> 14:14.875
appointment, like most of those . Well, typically 
it's supposed to be three years. But I decided that

14:18.319 --> 14:22.283
two years is enough. And the institution has a 
policy which the two years of leave of absence is

14:22.303 --> 14:29.850
sort of a limit. I could have probably gotten it for 
three years. But it seemed like two years was long

14:32.493 --> 14:34.655
enough to go away. You have a house and things like 
that back here. It's a long time. It seemed short

14:43.015 --> 14:47.902
then, too, actually, the way time goes. I think 
it's interesting to do something like that,

14:49.725 --> 14:53.430
because it's different than taking a visit. You go 
to a foreign country and you visit there for a

14:55.032 --> 14:57.435
while. You don't really learn the people, learn 
the language, and get a feel for what the people are

14:57.496 --> 15:03.945
like. That makes it very different, I think.

15:11.095 --> 15:12.577
And we don't regret that at all. When you returned 
back then to Woods Hole. Yeah, right. And then what

15:17.724 --> 15:19.967
did you begin to do? Then I became department 
chairman of ocean engineering. Because right at

15:24.093 --> 15:26.896
that time, Scott Dobbin was leaving. So this thing 
was open. I'd essentially done it before, so

15:29.540 --> 15:34.707
that's what happened.

15:36.340 --> 15:41.266
Started out working on, well, we got involved with 
some things for the Navy, another acoustics

15:36.340 --> 15:41.266
problem. I had started before I left, but Scott 
carried on, and then I took back over again. And

15:47.294 --> 15:54.323
that involved doing some work for the Navy, mostly 
classified work.

15:55.785 --> 16:00.211
The acoustic group at that time was in the geology 
and geophysics department, the way it was when I

15:55.785 --> 16:00.211
left. So it moved over into applied oceanography. 
So it's into ocean engineering. So it's an ocean

16:06.108 --> 16:07.731
engineering now. We just carried on, continued to 
do more of the same. It's different all the time,

16:12.658 --> 16:16.224
but in one way it's the same. So it's really fun.

16:21.332 --> 16:29.044
Now, I have some questions I want to ask you about 
funding now, the next series of questions. The

16:30.458 --> 16:32.822
nature of funding in oceanography has changed. It 
seems to be it's becoming more and more towards

16:32.862 --> 16:39.952
applied oceanography and ocean engineering. It 
seems like funds are more available there than

16:39.972 --> 16:48.044
they are for, I hate to use the term, basic research 
in science. What's your feelings about that? Does

16:49.567 --> 16:50.568
that seem accurate? Are you opposed to it? Support 
it? Well, I don't really know that it's true in the

16:54.754 --> 16:58.440
first place.

17:02.926 --> 17:06.132
I'm not so sure. There's very few people who do 
basic research, actually.

17:13.585 --> 17:20.377
Most people are solving puzzles of one kind or 
another, and they're not having really great new

17:13.585 --> 17:20.377
ideas or anything like that. They're sort of 
putting giant jigsaw puzzles together.

17:27.715 --> 17:37.108
If it's a difficult puzzle, I don't see where it 
makes much difference whether it's all applied or

17:27.715 --> 17:37.108
basic or what it is in that respect. And there's 
been a lot more talk about doing that sort of thing.

17:41.494 --> 17:57.115
But if you look at the money that's being spent, I 
think if you really do some of the sums, the basic

17:41.494 --> 17:57.115
part isn't doing badly at all in terms of funding. 
Funding is not kept up with inflation. And the

18:01.998 --> 18:05.082
number of people doing the work has increased a 
great deal. So it makes the competition a lot

18:05.403 --> 18:09.408
harder. Back in the early 60s, the number of people 
doing oceanography or oceanographically

18:09.448 --> 18:20.501
related things, there weren't very many places 
you could go do that. And now there are a lot. And of

18:24.061 --> 18:30.210
course, if you look at the total amount of money 
going into that type of work, it's appreciably

18:24.061 --> 18:30.210
more than it was then. I'm not quite sure how it 
relates if you put in all the inflation factors.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.680
Well, it's still more because there's more people 
doing it. Just look at the institution. We've

18:38.902 --> 18:44.029
grown from, what was it, 350 people when I came to 
something like 850 now. And there are other places

18:44.049 --> 18:50.338
that have come up around the country that when we 
started were zero. So that money is coming from

18:51.550 --> 18:54.353
somewhere, whether you talk about dollars. If you 
talk about man years, why, there are many more now

18:54.373 --> 19:00.299
than there were then. So I'm not sure what the real 
numbers are when you look at it that way.

19:07.906 --> 19:14.333
People talk about it because that's the way 
Congress likes to hear it, I guess. Anybody hates

19:14.353 --> 19:17.576
to spend their money and say, well, I don't really 
know what this is for. You probably don't even do

19:17.676 --> 19:20.899
that.

19:26.431 --> 19:33.739
And the ocean engineering, I think they're 
probably, it's very difficult. Well, I don't know

19:33.779 --> 19:35.481
whether it is or not. It's reasonably difficult 
these days to get money for equipment

19:35.681 --> 19:39.145
developments. People don't like to buy the 
equipment. Yet the equipment is what makes a lot of

19:42.388 --> 19:45.111
these experiments go. The technology is what 
makes a lot of these things go. And unless you

19:48.895 --> 19:51.698
develop it, you're not going to progress very far. 
But that's a hard one to sell a lot of people. And

19:56.654 --> 20:01.360
there is a lot of money sometimes wasted on 
developing technology that never does anything.

20:02.162 --> 20:07.849
So it's a matter of picking out the right people and 
saying, what do you think needs to be developed? Do

20:07.869 --> 20:08.470
it, then. That's the way you have to do it. And 
that's hard to do in any simple structure, I think.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.081
What's your impression of the Sea Grant program? 
Was it a good idea or a bad idea? How did it affect

20:18.424 --> 20:20.467
you? Oh, it gave me a lot of agony because I going to 
be Sea Grant director here back in 70, when was it,

20:23.840 --> 20:31.209
two, as well as being department chairman when 
they first came. And they said they had a bit of

20:31.249 --> 20:35.935
money, and we should build up this big proposal. So 
we worked hard getting this big proposal

20:35.955 --> 20:41.661
together, and then they didn't have any money at 
all. That's the only sour taste I have about Sea

20:41.681 --> 20:43.804
Grant. And that really wasn't their fault. No, I 
think it's been a good program. I think they're

20:47.569 --> 20:52.354
doing some good things around the country for a 
very practical sense. You know, they're supposed

20:52.494 --> 20:53.796
to be somewhat similar to the land grant, 
developing the sea for use. If you read, do you read

20:59.480 --> 21:02.324
many of their brochures that come out? They're 
doing things that help fishermen, help people

21:03.246 --> 21:10.096
that work along the edges, things like that, which 
is very good. I haven't followed it very closely,

21:10.136 --> 21:15.384
just because I haven't been personally involved 
in it too much. It's sort of looking at it from the

21:15.464 --> 21:18.349
outside. We have some people in our department 
that have had Sea Grant proposals and so on. But I

21:23.715 --> 21:28.261
haven't been involved in any of them myself, 
particularly the last quite a few years.

21:33.327 --> 21:43.239
There always tends to be the reaction, well, if it 
isn't done at one of the big places, it's not going

21:33.327 --> 21:43.239
to be as good work as if it's done somewhere else. 
That may be on the average true, but that doesn't

21:44.260 --> 21:47.524
mean it's always true. And that's one thing you 
have to be careful of. that you're getting too

21:52.265 --> 22:00.394
prejudiced about your own certain group's 
capabilities compared to other people's

21:52.265 --> 22:00.394
capabilities. Because there's just an awful lot 
of smart people in the world. Huh? That's true.

22:04.860 --> 22:05.681
There really are. Especially we have 200 million 
of them now. And if you take the top 1%, which isn't

22:09.865 --> 22:16.713
getting to be bad, well, there's 2 million people 
like that. So it's sort of interesting.

22:30.875 --> 22:43.187
which you were the happiest with or the proudest of 
in your career, what would you choose?

22:43.207 --> 22:54.998
Gee, I guess, let's

22:43.207 --> 22:54.998
see, I'm not sure. I was really happy when we found 
that bomb.

22:59.815 --> 23:04.380
It was a matter of luck, partially, more than 
skill. Perseverance, I guess. That was a very

23:06.942 --> 23:08.124
happy time. You really felt that you'd done 
something.

23:14.010 --> 23:17.173
Well, that sort of justified the whole thing of 
having Alvin. That said, no matter how much we'd

23:17.494 --> 23:22.399
spent on Alvin, right then it was all worth it. So 
that was nice, because there was a lot of people

23:23.019 --> 23:27.364
saying, well, you can't do anything with that. 
It'll never be useful. So that was probably one of

23:29.296 --> 23:32.239
the nicest things that happened.

23:36.264 --> 23:37.585
Since then, not much has happened. Very exciting. 
That really wasn't very exciting, but it sure was

23:39.588 --> 23:43.592
nice.

23:47.597 --> 23:57.868
Have there been any, a second question of this 
kind, have there been any sorts of discoveries in

23:47.597 --> 23:57.868
oceanography which have come as a shock to you in 
the last 10 or 15 years, something unexpected?

24:07.383 --> 24:08.144
Not really. I guess if you look out this harbor and 
watch the water moving there and just this harbor

24:08.164 --> 24:16.234
alone, it's very complicated. And you'd expect 
things like this to happen everywhere. So when

24:20.919 --> 24:29.229
people find new currents or big eddies or things 
like that, in a way, you're not surprised because

24:20.919 --> 24:29.229
it's complicated. You know what happens in the 
atmosphere to a reasonable extent. It's not

24:33.474 --> 24:36.478
surprising that the same type of things happen in 
the ocean column. The geology, of course, is this

24:39.777 --> 24:46.045
nifty thing about the sea floor spreading with the 
magnetics flipping. Now, that's quite a

24:46.065 --> 24:47.387
surprise. That, I suppose, is probably really the 
biggest surprise. And I would say that is

24:50.551 --> 25:05.150
probably, we're thinking about it, the fact that 
the Earth's field is flipped the way that it has and

24:50.551 --> 25:05.150
then recorded itself so nicely is really a major 
thing. I think that's, I would say that's the

25:05.170 --> 25:06.752
biggest surprise. The fact that the, well, Wagner 
wrote a book about seafloor spreading and so on. A

25:15.304 --> 25:17.847
lot of people have looked at that and said, well, 
something's happening there. So the fact that

25:18.809 --> 25:25.398
that has been more or less proven is very nice, but 
it didn't come as much as a surprise. But the way it

25:27.260 --> 25:30.865
was proven is a neat thing, I think. That's really 
nifty.

25:37.234 --> 25:38.055
I don't know this. Well, the Japanese claimed to 
have dredged up a few weeks ago and then threw back

25:38.896 --> 25:46.505
in. That's a real winner. That was the biggest 
surprise of all. Why did it go back in? Well, it

25:51.671 --> 25:52.832
smelled. That's very simple. If you're on the ship 
with it, I suppose it'd be easy to see that. I guess

26:00.121 --> 26:02.283
that would be the biggest one. I can't think of 
anything. If you were offering advice to a

26:06.789 --> 26:08.751
student, who was going to be a prospective 
oceanographer, what would you say should be where

26:09.507 --> 26:17.116
he should direct his energies presently? I don't 
want to use the word glamour fields or hot topics,

26:19.539 --> 26:32.634
but which direction do you think oceanography is 
going to go in terms of development? Well, it's

26:32.654 --> 26:34.376
going to go a bunch of ways. And the one to go into is 
the one that you're most interested in.

26:39.410 --> 26:48.440
Regardless of whether it looks like the best or 
not, because you'll probably do better in that one

26:39.410 --> 26:48.440
than if you try to pick out the one you think is going 
to be the most expansive. It depends on what you're

26:49.041 --> 26:51.684
looking for, I guess. Certainly in biology, 
there's an enormous field opening up. But it's

26:57.871 --> 26:59.673
also very, very competitive. The ocean 
engineering business of actually using Getting

27:08.637 --> 27:13.464
things out of the ocean is going to be a big field, 
but it's hard to guess how rapidly that's going to

27:08.637 --> 27:13.464
move. That's a tricky business. Technology 
limitation? Technology limitation. And

27:19.372 --> 27:22.376
knowledge about what's there is another 
limitation. We just haven't quite reached the

27:22.476 --> 27:27.083
position on that. You know, the petroleum is one 
problem, and that's pretty well. Well, we're not

27:30.648 --> 27:35.194
even sure how much petroleum we have, but we have 
good schemes of doing that. The other things that

27:35.274 --> 27:37.497
are in there, we're not sure about.

27:40.750 --> 27:50.044
I think it's really a matter of interest, rather 
than what the hot fields are going to be for people

27:40.750 --> 27:50.044
in our sort of standard. I think the one that people 
agree here most of is that you want to get an

27:52.027 --> 28:04.266
undergraduate training in a hard science, or at 
least a rigorous undergraduate training,

27:52.027 --> 28:04.266
regardless of what it's in. Because I think no 
matter what it does, if you do a good hard job, why?

28:09.623 --> 28:12.306
You're going to be able to go on and do something 
else better. If you start diverging too soon,

28:13.367 --> 28:22.675
learning too many facts without getting hard on 
one of them, you're not going to do as well. There

28:22.775 --> 28:24.837
are always exceptions to anything you say. I think 
most of the people at the institution feel that

28:24.857 --> 28:28.240
way. If you're going to be a biologist, you should 
study biology and maybe read about the

28:29.101 --> 28:37.369
oceanography part of it, but not do it until you get 
into graduate school. Same for physics or

28:38.277 --> 28:41.571
engineering, any of those.
