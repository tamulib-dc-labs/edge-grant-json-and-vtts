WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:07.348
Okay, well, my name is Mary Elaine Miller. My 
maiden name is Kraus. K-R-A-U-S. No, no, E. Oh,

00:09.330 --> 00:13.556
okay. From, where did Kraus come from? Well, my dad 
was from Detroit. Okay. And his ancestry all...

00:27.368 --> 00:29.322
originated in Detroit or Germany? I mean, you went 
back a couple of generations at Detroit, and then

00:29.382 --> 00:33.632
prior to that they were in Germany. I was fishing to 
see if you were Texas or something. I'm not a Texas

00:39.483 --> 00:41.025
debt lawyer. No, I'm a Texan by choice. Actually, I 
wasn't even by choice. I was dragged in kicking and

00:45.851 --> 00:49.676
screaming, but once I got here, I loved it. I was in a 
sense. My father told the three sons, three kids

00:50.778 --> 00:58.928
rather, three sons and daughter, we could go to 
school anywhere we wanted to as long as it wasn't

00:50.778 --> 00:58.928
Louisiana where we live. That's where I grew up. 
Because my mom, her maiden name is Troianni, and

01:01.072 --> 01:07.143
she's from New Orleans. And when I was very young, 
well, I actually was born in Key West, Florida. My

01:11.792 --> 01:12.774
dad was in the Navy. My mom and dad met in New 
Orleans, and they got married, and then she went to

01:12.814 --> 01:18.925
Key West with him. This was all during the war. And 
then when I was young, we moved to New Orleans. And I

01:25.692 --> 01:27.955
actually grew up in New Orleans. Oh, did you? OK. 
And lived there until I was 21, at which time I

01:28.655 --> 01:32.660
moved. Oh, yeah. I tell people that I've lived in 
several different places, but New Orleans is the

01:34.081 --> 01:38.766
most interesting of them. So I claim that as home. I 
was born there, but we grew up in Natchitoches.

01:48.577 --> 01:48.777
Oh, yeah. You grew up in New Orleans, basically. 
Right, and I went to school there also. I went to

01:54.817 --> 01:55.858
Loyola. Oh, did you? Okay. And I got a bachelor's 
degree in psychology.

02:02.285 --> 02:03.746
I'm trying to think. A junior history professor 
probably knows at Loyola. I used to know. Father,

02:08.571 --> 02:09.792
O'Neal. Oh, yes, I did know Father O'Neal. Did you 
know Father O'Neal? You bet. I surely did. He was a

02:15.238 --> 02:15.879
character. He could tell stories. He was 
wonderful. I'll tell you, the biggest character

02:19.007 --> 02:24.436
there, and this guy was really weird, this kind of 
pilier. He taught theology.

02:29.686 --> 02:31.409
But I remember O'Neill. I remember O'Neill 
sitting and regaling us with New Orleans, I guess

02:31.429 --> 02:37.139
it was a dialect. He couldn't. imitate the 
language from each different block. Oh, really?

02:43.460 --> 02:44.702
Oh, I love that. The pure Brooklyn. Yeah, my 
brother sounds like a Brooklyn cab driver. Yeah, I

02:50.149 --> 02:57.579
had aunts who lived in New Orleans, and they liked 
me in the Prince Porter area. And they were so

02:57.639 --> 02:58.861
amazing. Oh, yes. I thought that was interesting. 
So, Loyola, psychology? Yeah, and then after

03:02.912 --> 03:06.598
that, I went up to Princeton. I actually had a very 
short-lived marriage that took me to Princeton.

03:11.806 --> 03:21.201
My husband was a graduate student there, and I 
worked in the psychology department and just took

03:11.806 --> 03:21.201
some courses there.

03:21.535 --> 03:28.412
My marriage didn't survive, but I met my present 
husband at Princeton, and then we ended up at

03:21.535 --> 03:28.412
Michigan State. Okay. My father went to Michigan 
State. We've got all kinds of connections,

03:31.960 --> 03:34.627
haven't we? Isn't it funny how people just travel 
in the same circle? Well, then at Michigan State, I

03:38.225 --> 03:42.369
did not work at the university. I worked for the 
state of Michigan. And I went into social work. And

03:45.892 --> 03:53.938
I actually took a lot of courses at the university 
because I had, at that time, attended to try to go to

03:45.892 --> 03:53.938
law school. Well, actually, I was going to go to law 
school. And then I was going to go to medical

03:55.440 --> 03:56.881
school. So I took courses for years in all the 
basics that I needed. And then I ended up doing

04:01.565 --> 04:03.306
neither one. But I worked in social work and then 
went into supervision. And then I was a case worker

04:08.600 --> 04:14.509
for the state. And that was before it was split into 
income maintenance and child welfare. It was

04:18.735 --> 04:20.137
together at the time. So you worked with the entire 
families and did both the income maintenance part

04:20.638 --> 04:27.928
and the social work aspect. And then I became a 
supervisor. And then my career just kind of

04:30.472 --> 04:35.059
evolved in an entirely different direction away 
from social work. I had almost a... life-changing

04:38.182 --> 05:00.628
experience in social work where a young woman that 
I had worked with and really loved as a matter of

04:38.182 --> 05:00.628
fact and we just developed such an affection 
before I had a baby she went into a mental

04:38.182 --> 05:00.628
institution we had to take the baby away place the 
baby elsewhere and I had to go testify in court

05:01.064 --> 05:30.531
again about her incompetence as a parent and she 
ended up killing herself and that was and and she

05:01.064 --> 05:30.531
was like a younger sister to me i mean that's how 
much i had become attached to her and i realized at

05:01.064 --> 05:30.531
that moment that you don't change people they 
change themselves and i wasn't i wasn't the person

05:01.064 --> 05:30.531
to do it so anyway i went into supervision and then i 
got into management into training and then into

05:30.511 --> 05:37.241
management development, and had a wonderful 
director by the name of Jack Dempsey. He was known

05:37.261 --> 05:39.244
all over the state. He was the governor's 
right-hand man, and he was known in Washington. He

05:44.933 --> 05:52.705
was highly respected everywhere in political and 
welfare system. circles and he died prematurely

05:53.427 --> 05:58.173
from lung cancer. He was a chain smoker but he gave 
me wonderful opportunities for development and I

05:58.193 --> 06:23.164
ended up traveling all over the country really on 
different projects and was able to get a half

05:58.193 --> 06:23.164
million dollar grant to run what we were calling an 
organizational development project. and it was a

06:23.735 --> 06:37.248
demonstration project for the federal 
government demonstrating how if you change the, I

06:23.735 --> 06:37.248
mean it was really state of the art with regard to 
management techniques. If you change the way you

06:41.133 --> 06:49.025
manage the people in an organization, you're 
going to change the way the organization

06:41.133 --> 06:49.025
produces. And so we did some really in-depth, 
creative management development with all

06:49.045 --> 07:02.685
managers and supervisors in different 
organizations around the state. and wrote up a

07:02.665 --> 07:06.529
two-year study. You were mainly in state agencies 
or federal agencies? No, we were working in the

07:09.932 --> 07:16.138
state of Michigan welfare agencies in a lot of the 
different counties. And we had picked like six

07:16.219 --> 07:20.363
demonstration sites. But in doing so, then, we 
worked with a couple of other states because they

07:20.383 --> 07:29.652
were also involved in the project.

07:30.458 --> 07:45.861
At the end of the two years, we wrote up a report that 
was just dramatic changes, and it was published by

07:30.458 --> 07:45.861
Share, I can't remember, it's been so long, it's 
been 20 or 25 years. Anyway, and then I had the

07:46.021 --> 07:53.833
opportunity to make presentations all over the 
country with regard to this project. As a result, I

07:54.083 --> 08:00.622
went from the social work part of it into 
management and management development. Then I

08:00.682 --> 08:08.886
got into strategic planning and became the 
director of planning for this large state agency

08:00.682 --> 08:08.886
that had 14,000 employees all across the state. 
Well, after that, then, I started having

08:10.250 --> 08:15.478
children, and we moved to Atlanta. And so I had 
decided that while the children were young, I had

08:15.498 --> 08:20.045
three of them while they were young. What was your 
husband doing there? My husband had a PhD in

08:21.608 --> 08:33.186
chemistry, and he was the vice chair of the 
chemistry department at Michigan State. Then he

08:33.402 --> 08:40.151
was at Ohio State for a very short time and 
commuted, actually, on weekends because we never

08:33.402 --> 08:40.151
made the move. And then he went into an 
instrumentation company, a scientific

08:40.852 --> 08:51.646
instrumentation company, Nicolet Instrument, 
in Atlanta, Georgia, and we moved to Atlanta. And

08:51.666 --> 08:53.869
at that time was when I had the very young children. 
So what I did instead of getting a full-time job, I

08:53.929 --> 08:59.376
went to work for Actually, I went to work with one 
other person in a management consulting firm, and

09:00.065 --> 09:18.770
we did some management consulting for the welfare 
agency in Atlanta and for a couple of other

09:00.065 --> 09:18.770
organizations, a bank and what was that? I can't 
remember. But that worked pretty good. That

09:20.172 --> 09:26.460
worked out just fine because I was able to work at 
home a lot and speak with the children and yet stay

09:20.172 --> 09:26.460
in touch with them. How long ago was that when you 
were doing that roughly? That ended about 14 years

09:30.656 --> 09:33.868
ago. Because we moved here. That kind of an 
activity, and now everybody's becoming

09:35.739 --> 09:39.483
management consultants. Oh, yeah. Everything I 
did, I did at the front end of it, and then dropped it

09:39.763 --> 09:46.469
and went into something else. Yeah, that was 
before management consulting was quite so

09:47.290 --> 09:51.413
popular. Then we moved here, and I did... And your 
husband came to the... He came to the College of

09:59.561 --> 10:02.183
Science here. Okay. And he was actually the Saba in 
the College of Science, and then he took over as the

10:02.722 --> 10:14.996
Director of Electronic Microscopy, and he's now 
in Research Administration.

10:16.158 --> 10:20.423
And he does just a tiny little bit of teaching and no 
research anymore. But we moved here, and then I...

10:23.867 --> 10:24.768
When did you come to college? We moved here in 1984, 
and in 86, I came to work for the university. So I've

10:32.978 --> 10:37.103
been here about 11 years. And what was your first 
employment? I was the Director of Operations

10:37.924 --> 10:47.135
Analysis, which was the group that did 
operational reviews on campus. Under whom? Under

10:49.438 --> 10:50.580
Robert Smith. Robert hired me and I worked at him 
until he retired. And then after a couple of years

10:58.612 --> 11:06.808
of that job, I became Assistant Vice President for 
Finance and Administration.

11:06.828 --> 11:10.916
And I am now Associate Vice President for 
Administration. Let me get those titles correct.

11:13.200 --> 11:18.510
Assistant Vice President for Finance and 
Administration. And then, and now... I'm

11:21.520 --> 11:30.798
associate vice president for administration 
because we split finance and administration into

11:21.520 --> 11:30.798
two divisions. When Robert became the vice 
president, we put the two divisions together. Who

11:35.667 --> 11:39.735
is the vice president for finance? Bill Crump. 
Where's Danny Parker in the home? Danny Parker is

11:44.042 --> 11:46.406
with the provost. He's the head of the fiscal part 
of Ron Douglas.

11:57.722 --> 11:57.923
Thank you. 20 years ago. OK, now, and let's see. 
When does the press come into your focus? OK. As I

12:10.803 --> 12:13.287
said, I was the head of operations analysis. When I 
came over to be assistant vice president for

12:13.367 --> 12:21.619
finance and administration, I still had 
responsibility for operations analysis. I had

12:21.639 --> 12:24.283
responsibility for human resources. I had 
responsibility for parking and a couple of other

12:25.104 --> 12:28.429
departments. But the key ones were operations 
analysis, which did exactly what it said. I mean,

12:35.099 --> 12:39.105
they looked at organizations and analyzed where 
they were going wrong. and for human resources,

12:39.642 --> 12:44.570
which meant that we worked with the people side of 
it. And that's really what my talent is and my

12:44.670 --> 12:59.595
interest is in organizational analysis and 
particularly how you make people work

12:44.670 --> 12:59.595
effectively together in organizations, team 
building, things like that. Well, Rick Stetter

12:59.615 --> 13:04.924
reported to Bill Mobley, the president at the 
time, And Rick was having some real serious

13:05.410 --> 13:10.493
problems with managing his organization. And so 
Bill sent him to me, to talk to me, and I spent

13:11.080 --> 13:25.133
several hours, several sessions that were like 
two hours long each, working with Rick on what he

13:11.080 --> 13:25.133
could do. Good. I was glad to hear that. That 
clarifies a lot. Okay. Thank you. Working with

13:28.536 --> 13:32.940
Rick on what he could do to get it back at the price. 
And he was very open, as you said, about all the

13:32.961 --> 13:37.905
things that he did wrong. Yes, yes. He would come to 
me and hang his head and say, this is what I've done.

13:43.549 --> 13:47.483
And I would work with him and say, Rick, These are 
the kinds of things that you need to do if you want to

13:48.037 --> 13:54.064
be able to work effectively with the people in your 
organization. And he would make notes, and I gave

13:54.104 --> 14:02.134
him a book to read on the seven habits of highly 
effective people and things like that. And we

14:02.174 --> 14:16.812
talked about how he could set some goals with his 
people because their acquisitions were

14:02.174 --> 14:16.812
declining, their publications were declining, 
people were not working together effectively.

14:16.792 --> 14:22.277
And one thing I said to him was, Rick, stop 
discussing your personal business with your

14:16.792 --> 14:22.277
employees. Just stop. Yeah, and Noah said he told 
him that over and over again. Rick wrote it all

14:26.720 --> 14:28.302
down. He said, yes, yes, I know exactly what to do. 
He would walk out of my office pumped up,

14:30.504 --> 14:35.028
enthusiastic, and never did a thing. Would come 
back a month later. And I finally said, Rick,

14:36.529 --> 14:41.353
you're not doing anything that you know you have to 
do. You're not going to succeed. So he finally

14:44.035 --> 14:46.157
left. And this was at, I remember, this was at a 
Mother's Club coffee on a Saturday morning in the

14:46.508 --> 15:01.616
fall, just as Rick, Rick was on extended sick leave 
at the time. Actually, he was just, they were, they

15:01.636 --> 15:06.745
just tried to get him to go home. And Bill Mobley and 
Robert Smith and I and Dean Gage, who was the

15:06.978 --> 15:17.010
provost, were standing around talking about the 
press and what we were going to do with the press.

15:18.132 --> 15:28.524
And Rick apparently had talked to Bill Mobley and 
suggested that I be involved in any decision about

15:18.132 --> 15:28.524
the future of the press, because Rick, I think, 
really respected my opinion. He just couldn't do

15:28.564 --> 15:32.309
anything with the information. And so Bill Mobley 
said to me, well, what do you know about And I said,

15:36.779 --> 15:40.823
well, I read books. And that's a common 
denominator, incidentally. Oh, is that right?

15:44.366 --> 15:44.587
Yes, it is. Everybody who's in there, you know, 
it's an accidental profession, they call it. No

15:49.952 --> 15:52.895
one plans to go into publishing. And what is the 
ties between them? They all like books. They

15:55.577 --> 15:59.000
really do, no matter who, from clerks on up or down. 
Oh, well, that's interesting. I said, well, I read

16:00.782 --> 16:01.783
books. And he said, well, that's good enough. 
That's right, yeah. He said, I'd like you to go in.

16:06.192 --> 16:12.759
And just see what you can do to pull that group back 
into a team until we can find the right director.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.702
And so that's how I ended up there. Not because I had 
any strength in publishing at all, but because I

16:15.742 --> 16:22.869
had strength in helping people. So that's how I got 
there. Excellent. Thank you. That helped so much.

16:28.956 --> 16:29.556
That's a good story. And I used most of all of that. 
You can read and edit it as you like. I think I

16:33.861 --> 16:35.963
handled these things better. So you go to the 
press. What month was that? Do you remember? I

16:44.037 --> 16:45.840
believe that was in October. Oh no, that was before 
95. That was October of 94, I guess. End of

16:52.453 --> 16:55.639
September, beginning of October, something like 
that. And I remember at the time that that's when I

16:58.336 --> 17:04.443
was also chairing the Shots Across Brazos Valley. 
I don't know if you remember that, where we did the

17:04.544 --> 17:08.028
flu shots and the immunizations. Well, that was 
eating my lunch for the first two or three months

17:08.609 --> 17:13.334
that I was there. And so I was very stressed out. And 
everyone there had, I mean, I think they were

17:16.318 --> 17:27.752
wondering, what is this animal that came here, you 
know, that's still doing assistant vice

17:16.318 --> 17:27.752
president work, is consumed with this community 
project that you know i was doing before the

17:28.120 --> 17:42.940
university and is here trying to help us but we we 
worked through it and they were wonderful people

17:28.120 --> 17:42.940
and very accepting yeah they are Now, what I had 
known, you asked me what were my impressions

17:43.240 --> 17:48.485
before and after I got there. What I had known about 
before I got in was only through Rick. I'd never met

17:53.150 --> 18:02.579
anybody there before I walked in the door the 
first, well actually Dean took me over a week

17:53.150 --> 18:02.579
before and introduced me. But prior to that I'd 
never known any of them. And so Rick had told me

18:06.563 --> 18:10.227
about different people that gave me an insight 
into their strengths and some of their strengths

18:11.000 --> 18:15.307
and weaknesses. So I had formed some opinions 
before I ever got there, some of which were right

18:15.427 --> 18:23.380
and some of which were not right. But I had a pretty 
good sense of the kind of disharmony that existed

18:23.881 --> 18:32.275
in the organization and the backbiting. And that 
was just reinforced when I got there. I mean, I

18:35.780 --> 18:37.463
think my impressions were fairly accurate but I 
didn't have any idea of the depth of the pain that

18:38.118 --> 18:45.375
existed in that organization. They had allowed 
themselves to to be practically destroyed. Yeah.

18:55.708 --> 19:16.922
And the one question that I kept asking them after I 
really saw how painful it was for them, the one

18:55.708 --> 19:16.922
question that I asked so many of them was, how could 
you have ever given one person that kind of power

18:55.708 --> 19:16.922
over your life that you would allow him to have that 
negative impact on you? Yeah. And what answer did

19:17.062 --> 19:19.125
you get? It was almost like They had not thought of 
it that way, but they had released that power

19:20.913 --> 19:25.119
themselves. I said, you didn't have to let Rick 
come in and destroy your relationships. You let

19:29.645 --> 19:30.907
that happen. And I was going to say, one of the 
answers might indeed be that this is the way they

19:30.967 --> 19:36.975
were brought up, which was the Wardlaw syndrome. 
Well, it could be. They were under the control.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.021
Because they talked about it. They didn't think 
for themselves. They talked to Wardlaw as the

19:42.363 --> 19:44.946
father figure. And there's not, you know, Lloyd 
didn't have quite that connotation, but he still

19:44.966 --> 19:49.873
continuously That's right. The Wardlaw era. And I 
think he did it consciously, deliberately. Well,

19:55.319 --> 19:55.820
probably. I'm sure he was trying. Possibly. He was 
probably trying to be another Frank Wardlaw,

19:58.264 --> 20:01.329
because... I don't think so. I think he was using 
the Franks. Oh, really? I really do. friendship

20:07.319 --> 20:26.695
with lloyd but the more i looked at this you know he 
gave so many benefits continued to toot frank

20:07.319 --> 20:26.695
wardlaw and this is not necessarily natural you 
know well let's face it i mean unless you have an

20:07.319 --> 20:26.695
enormous ego it would be really hard to follow in 
those footsteps exactly yeah So I think he used the

20:27.012 --> 20:33.982
Barlow image deliberately to continue to 
cultivate this aura, and it worked. I mean, you

20:34.542 --> 20:41.132
know, you keep Joe Moore, and you kept John 
Lindsay, and you kept all the rest of the boys in the

20:34.542 --> 20:41.132
corral, literally. And it was amazing. And I 
think, I may be totally wrong, but this is kind of

20:43.295 --> 20:47.360
the way I see it. I think the culture and the whole 
place is a family culture, and they have a father

20:47.380 --> 20:55.872
image of their directors, And they preferred to do 
that. And Rick certainly could not provide that,

21:00.464 --> 21:04.510
nor did he need to. I mean, what he needed to do was 
what I ended up having to do by necessity, because I

21:04.530 --> 21:10.980
knew nothing about the business. And that was let 
them do their jobs. And that was my focus. And

21:16.728 --> 21:19.132
Rotell and I kind of touched on this a little bit. 
And I talked to him about it. And we talked about the

21:21.315 --> 21:23.298
family culture. And he said, yeah, and I'm 
uncomfortable with that. Yeah, they acknowledge

21:26.058 --> 21:32.347
now to me that he is not, that he is uncomfortable 
with that. And maybe they just need to recognize

21:32.447 --> 21:36.573
that those days are over. That's it. That's it. And 
in fact, the way I think of it is they have to grow up

21:39.477 --> 21:45.226
and stand on their own two feet. It was such a 
close-knit society in a peculiar way. They're

21:48.490 --> 21:53.938
open, you know, there are a lot of people eating 
out, but by the same token, they're very

21:48.490 --> 21:53.938
tight-knit. Well, I'm hoping that if I brought 
anything to that organization, it was two things.

22:00.261 --> 22:17.045
One is that I restored or maybe built a team, 
because I'm not sure how much the team actually

22:00.261 --> 22:17.045
existed or whether the decisions were just doled 
out by the head, but that I helped to build them into

22:00.261 --> 22:17.045
a team. And the other is that I helped them to stand 
on their own two feet, because as I said, I couldn't

22:18.146 --> 22:24.415
make the decisions for them. All I could do was to 
push them to make their own decisions. So kind of to

22:29.429 --> 22:38.782
help them to grow up and to become a mature press 
rather than the fledgling press that I saw when I

22:29.429 --> 22:38.782
first got there. That they were still, you know, 
kind of a baby press. That helps. That fits pretty

22:46.612 --> 22:52.140
well where I'm moving, I think, between the two of 
you. Well, this is what I found when I first got

22:52.745 --> 22:55.307
there. I wrote down some negative things that I 
found and some positive things. I found that they

22:59.972 --> 23:02.934
were basically immobilized. And they had been 
that way, I think, for a couple of years. They had

23:06.978 --> 23:11.522
declining acquisitions, declining production, 
because they couldn't work. They were so consumed

23:11.602 --> 23:21.992
with talking about their problems and focusing on 
their problems and thinking about their problems

23:11.602 --> 23:21.992
that they weren't working on their business. They 
wasted a tremendous amount of time. There was a lot

23:26.645 --> 23:30.830
of paranoia in the organization, a lot of 
back-fighting. There were closed doors with two

23:30.870 --> 23:38.059
people sitting in there talking about something 
else that was going on in the organization. A lot of

23:38.660 --> 23:47.490
frustration, and I mean professional 
frustration because they didn't feel like they

23:38.660 --> 23:47.490
were doing anything with their careers. There was 
some sorrow because many of them who had been there

23:47.842 --> 23:55.955
a while knew the glory of the press, and it wasn't 
there at all anymore. They felt that sense of loss.

23:59.340 --> 24:04.869
In fact, when I walked in there, oh, I heard about 
for ages was Frank Ward Law and what it used to be

23:59.340 --> 24:04.869
like. And if I didn't have such a strong ego of mine, 
I mean, if I didn't have so much... of my own

24:12.698 --> 24:17.386
personal sense of satisfaction, I think I'd have 
been crushed. Crushed by the ward law, yeah. But I

24:18.487 --> 24:20.931
didn't feel sensitive about it at all. They were 
working against one another, and there was

24:21.352 --> 24:28.263
completely inadequate communication. I mean, 
they didn't talk enough about anything with

24:28.964 --> 24:33.492
regard to the business. On the positive side... 
What I found were people who were tremendously

24:36.830 --> 24:47.666
talented and tremendously dedicated to that 
organization. They loved the business that

24:47.686 --> 24:50.630
they're in. They absolutely loved it. But even 
more than that, they loved the press. The Texas A&M

24:56.338 --> 24:58.281
University Press. They loved that organization. 
And they hated what was happening to it. They had

25:03.779 --> 25:07.764
wonderful relationships with their operatives. 
And they had a real eagerness to get back on track.

25:13.371 --> 25:16.676
They just didn't have a clue how to do it. So with 
that,

25:16.696 --> 25:24.686
we set about... How did you find all this out? Just 
talking to them and watching them.

25:29.581 --> 25:34.230
Because that's one thing I did pick up. You were 
always there. You were always to be seen. And that

25:37.897 --> 25:40.081
really helped, they said. Because it kind of gave, 
it was an open door in itself. And I think that's one

25:43.106 --> 25:45.130
of the expressions somebody used. When you came 
in, the door was open. All the doors opened. In

25:49.238 --> 25:52.003
fact, I told them not to close the doors. Good! I 
said, I didn't want, you know, Diana Hine used to,

25:53.408 --> 26:01.360
her door was always closed and locked when she was 
not there. And I said, no more. The door stays open.

26:04.925 --> 26:18.825
I said, if you've got something that other people 
can't see, first I would be puzzled as to what that

26:04.925 --> 26:18.825
was, but if it's something confidential, you put 
it in a file cabinet, you lock it, and you give

26:04.925 --> 26:18.825
someone else the key so that if we need to get out, we 
can't. Your computer doesn't get locked up so that

26:19.885 --> 26:26.455
nobody can, you know, retrieve your information. 
Bonnie and Jim really did pretty well. I mean, he

26:28.117 --> 26:32.243
laughed, I think, because of the stresses and the 
strange things he did. I think he was a smoker and

26:32.263 --> 26:34.166
they didn't like smoking. Oh, yeah. They resented 
him, too. They resented the arrangement that Rick

26:37.030 --> 26:39.955
made with him. Yeah, did they? They really 
resented him. In fact, they resented a lot of one

26:43.440 --> 26:45.623
another. Wonderful people. And they have been 
such a tight, productive group. And one of the

26:52.698 --> 27:06.316
things you said that I think it was a useful sense of 
work ethic, and that is that everything we do,

26:52.698 --> 27:06.316
everyone has touched. Each book has been touched 
by everybody in the state. That was a nice

27:09.140 --> 27:10.481
expression. We all do this together. And I think, 
and they may have lost that, but I think it's It's

27:16.332 --> 27:17.914
coming back, but it's still there. But I thought 
that expressed, indeed, the sense of cohesion and

27:17.934 --> 27:26.204
basic work ethic in the group. Well, I think that's 
what I tried to do when I got there. See, the way that

27:28.727 --> 27:35.775
I believe in communication, I believe that that's 
the answer to most of the problems. Just talk about

27:35.795 --> 27:37.237
them. And so that's what I tried to do. And if ever I 
heard a rumbling, I would try to bring in the two

27:39.019 --> 27:46.187
people who were having the problem and get them to 
talk it out. And sometimes it didn't work, but most

27:46.538 --> 27:50.833
of the time it did. I tried to open up the business to 
everybody. We would have, and in fact, I think it

27:54.204 --> 27:57.375
drove them crazy. And when Tom came in, he 
immediately stopped what I had started. But I

28:01.905 --> 28:05.450
think what I did was real important at the time. We 
would have weekly or biweekly, I mean semiweekly.

28:10.536 --> 28:11.918
Sometimes I think it was twice a week. I can't 
remember. But very frequent staff meetings with

28:12.739 --> 28:17.325
large groups of people. And we would talk about 
everything. And some of them were very resentful

28:19.328 --> 28:21.991
at the beginning. They'd say, why are you having 
these people talk about my business? I do the

28:25.317 --> 28:27.700
acquisitions. I do the editing. I do the working 
with the printers and all that. Why is everybody

28:34.010 --> 28:36.633
getting involved in my business? And they were 
getting very defensive. And we worked on that and

28:38.436 --> 28:40.900
worked on it and worked on it. And I said, as long as 
I'm here, your business is their business.

28:45.146 --> 28:46.888
Everybody's business is together. And I tried 
real hard to emphasize this notion of internal

28:47.509 --> 28:53.518
customers. that their primary customers were one 
another. I took the entire staff on a retreat. I

29:02.447 --> 29:06.632
think it was a two-day retreat. We didn't stay 
over. We drove back and forth. We went down to Camp

29:09.235 --> 29:10.397
Allen. And the entire staff, including Mike in the 
warehouse, the only people who stayed behind were

29:10.417 --> 29:16.164
student workers. And we talked about the purpose 
of the press, the goals that we had for the press,

29:23.671 --> 29:27.397
communication styles. We played games. We did 
team building kinds of things. And this was my

29:31.062 --> 29:41.077
emphasis the entire 18 months that I was there, was 
to try to get them working together as a team. And

29:41.137 --> 29:43.120
they're doing the publishing job. Your job is to 
get them to do the publishing job. That's right.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.927
And they would come to me with questions about 
publishing. And I would say, that's your

29:48.007 --> 29:51.332
expertise. Although I learned an awful lot, and I 
did end up making a lot of decisions. And I'll tell

29:56.132 --> 30:03.610
you, the reason that I made a lot of decisions is 
because they were very conservative about what

29:56.132 --> 30:03.610
they were willing... They confessed that 
conservative... And I used to push them to stretch

30:03.630 --> 30:08.562
their limits, you know. Oh, you're ordering 
20,000 copies? I think you can sell 25. Order 25. I

30:13.489 --> 30:15.252
made some mistakes, but that's OK. They just 
stretched and stretched. They probably got that

30:16.594 --> 30:20.219
extra 5,000 sitting in the warehouse now. They 
didn't want to do certain types of books. I said,

30:22.242 --> 30:24.225
why not? That's ridiculous. And Noel would say 
things like, we don't do poetry. And I said, I can't

30:28.431 --> 30:35.021
believe that if you ended up with a Robert Frost 
manuscript that you wouldn't publish it. Well.

30:37.010 --> 30:39.633
Incidentally, I'm still kind of thinking this one 
over. Frank Wardlaw turned down a DeBakey

30:39.733 --> 30:43.957
manuscript in 1977.

30:49.844 --> 30:52.346
Well, they... Because we don't do medicine. 
Right. That's right. Well, I said, you know, we'll

30:55.630 --> 31:02.878
do whatever is, you know, whatever we can do a good 
job of doing. We won't take on things that that

31:05.647 --> 31:11.085
obviously we're going to fail with, but on the 
other hand, we're going to really stretch. Did you

31:11.105 --> 31:14.677
begin to sense at some point a turnaround? Yeah, I 
did. First of all, we're in the Borderlands. We're

31:17.492 --> 31:18.874
doing the Borderlands series. And that was one of 
the things that I had really pushed. Because I

31:22.642 --> 31:25.467
thought, it's an excellent opportunity. We've 
got people on our, whatever the board is called,

31:25.747 --> 31:32.079
the fundraising board, who are from Laredo. 
They're interested in us as a press. They're

31:35.806 --> 31:37.189
interested in helping us.
