00:01.043 --> 00:14.702
This is an interview with Dr. Lawrence Franks by 
Scott Chancellor on April 18, 1993, at

00:01.043 --> 00:14.702
Nacogdoches, Texas, concerning protest 
movements and activism by students on the campus

00:01.043 --> 00:14.702
of the University of Texas from the mid-1960s to 
the early 1970s. In the interest of accumulating

00:16.304 --> 00:23.434
knowledge, I'm asking you to donate this tape to me 
or to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in the

00:16.304 --> 00:23.434
University Archives. Is that all right with you? 
Yes. Okay, Dr. Franks. What year and where were you

00:29.528 --> 00:31.270
born? I was born March 28, 1916, Stockman, Texas, 
in Shelby County. Okay, what is your educational

00:40.157 --> 00:42.359
background? I finished high school, five years of 
college with a master's degree and a doctorate

00:43.220 --> 00:52.548
from Indiana University in 1955. Okay,

00:52.588 --> 00:57.713
what was your position at the University of Texas? 
I went to work at the University of Texas in Austin

00:58.587 --> 01:05.734
August 1, 1966 as dean of men. The areas over which 
our staff had responsibility were student

01:07.196 --> 01:20.510
conduct, student housing, and student 
organizations.

01:20.530 --> 01:21.531
What years were you there? I was there from 64 to 77.

01:28.152 --> 01:32.876
Can you describe for me the mood and the atmosphere 
on campus during these years where you were there?

01:33.817 --> 01:34.357
Yes. The mood and general climate on college and 
university campuses all over the country, and

01:34.678 --> 01:51.052
particularly on the East Coast and the West Coast, 
was that of rising wave of activism and protest.

01:53.674 --> 01:57.417
There was a wide range of topics that were being 
addressed there and therefore became topics of

01:57.920 --> 02:04.610
discussion on the university campus, the 
University of Texas campus. And that was over the

02:05.551 --> 02:26.863
nation's participation in the various wars, the 
lack of an aggressive program to promote an

02:05.551 --> 02:26.863
increased minority enrollment, university 
regulations dealing with student conduct on and

02:05.551 --> 02:26.863
off campus, women's rights. and a stronger voice 
for all students in formulating the new rules and

02:27.282 --> 02:36.296
regulations affecting the lives of all the 
students. The university campus and the area

02:37.298 --> 02:50.959
adjacent to it, the campus became a gathering 
place for students and non-students to protest

02:37.298 --> 02:50.959
these various issues. The name given to the 
organization that was formed was Students for a

02:55.818 --> 03:12.039
Democratic Society, an activist group formed on 
the Michigan campus by Tom Hayden, a meeting place

02:55.818 --> 03:12.039
for the new organization that was found across the 
street from the campus. One of the early causes

03:14.062 --> 03:22.112
represented by the SDS organization was to stage 
nightly demonstrations at a lounge across the

03:22.717 --> 03:34.772
street from the campus at which a black student had 
not been allowed to purchase a beer.

03:44.363 --> 03:49.129
Let me add to what I've just said about the 
demonstration at the lounge. our role there. When

03:51.924 --> 04:00.531
my staff was represented at one of these 
demonstrations, and we saw many, we were there as

03:51.924 --> 04:00.531
observers. We were not there to arrest anybody or 
stop anything that was happening, but to observe

04:00.632 --> 04:19.048
and be able to report back to the administration of 
the university what we perceived happened on that

04:19.484 --> 04:27.792
occasion, or the demonstration were on campus or 
off campus. Okay. What percentage of students

04:30.014 --> 04:33.938
would you say were involved with the protest 
movements? Oh, that would be too difficult to come

04:34.779 --> 04:39.484
close, I expect. We would have fifty people, a 
hundred people, and then in the days when we had the

04:41.106 --> 04:48.613
largest of protesters. One time 20,000 people 
came to the campus protesting in the Cambodian War

04:50.199 --> 05:04.278
and the incident at Kent State where some students 
were killed by the National Guard. And of course,

05:04.919 --> 05:17.757
on demonstrations such as this, we had faculty 
members, staff members, citizens of the

05:04.919 --> 05:17.757
community, but the hard core And when I say 
hardcore, the people who composed the Students

05:17.973 --> 05:34.012
for a Democratic Society, that was a very small, 
very small, but vocal group. If I were to take a

05:34.212 --> 05:38.437
figure, I would say it would be less than 5%. We had 
24,500 students on the campus that first year I was

05:39.158 --> 05:44.585
there. And so it was a small group. small but vocal. 
What type of students were they? Could you

05:51.223 --> 05:56.011
describe how they dressed and describe them? 
Well, as we got to know many of them, many of them

05:56.031 --> 06:07.188
were brilliant students from other colleges or 
from UT. They were not dummies. They were smart,

06:09.307 --> 06:17.394
brilliant people that had some deep-seated 
causes that they wanted to represent. Others,

06:18.335 --> 06:28.284
however, were sort of an unkempt group that 
dressed their demeanor, their clothing, their

06:18.335 --> 06:28.284
beard, their hair. And of course, hair became a 
symbol of the protest movement, long hair. I

06:35.771 --> 06:39.094
talked to many students on the campus and off the 
campus about, why did you let your hair grow wrong?

06:44.339 --> 06:45.540
That's just the style. And I would say, well, does 
it have anything to do with the protesting, the

06:46.421 --> 06:51.586
status quo? Yes. Yes. I think they could be 
identified as a group whose dress was not like that

06:53.287 --> 07:03.856
of the fraternity men or women. It appeared to me 
that they did this on purpose. The women wore their

07:11.028 --> 07:13.632
high-top shoes a lot. It

07:13.652 --> 07:21.003
just didn't look like a little girl was getting 
ready to go to a party. A dress was an important part

07:22.466 --> 07:28.956
of the protest, I think. Do you think their dress 
presented a negative image to Well, I think for

07:33.327 --> 07:47.303
many people, I think there's a stereotypical 
notion that the dress makes the person, and you can

07:33.327 --> 07:47.303
judge a person's character and maybe a lot of other 
things about him, about the way he dresses. The

07:49.005 --> 07:54.091
banker goes to work with his pinstripe suit on and 
necktie, you know. And the farmer goes to the field

07:54.111 --> 07:59.537
with his overalls and jumper on. So I think that 
there's

08:00.665 --> 08:10.760
some mighty fine people that never had a suit of 
clothes on. And so we can't conclude that the dress

08:10.780 --> 08:19.553
did any more than represent, and I think it did 
represent a mood. The mood was, we'll show you that

08:20.153 --> 08:23.999
we can dress like this. I had trouble one time 
getting a person, whether it was an SDS

08:24.800 --> 08:30.148
representative, They were before a committee on 
the university campus, and the chairman asked

08:30.753 --> 08:41.110
this man to put his cap on, and he refused. But the 
chairman told him that he would not proceed with

08:41.130 --> 08:46.077
the meeting until he put his cap on. Well, that was 
sort of the mood that some of the SDS people

08:46.097 --> 08:57.756
presented. And of course, the university would be 
just as insistent as we expected to put the camp up

08:58.394 --> 09:04.881
in Germany.

09:07.624 --> 09:08.104
And it did. Okay.

09:14.912 --> 09:27.625
Okay, if you would, discuss SDS on campus, their 
role with the students, and how the

09:14.912 --> 09:27.625
administration dealt with them. Well, the two or 
three things about the SDS, Students for a

09:29.495 --> 09:41.606
Democratic Society, we got to know some of the 
individuals personally. And by the way, there was

09:42.067 --> 09:46.230
President's student body, Jeff Jones. He was a 
candidate promoted by the SDS, supported by the

09:48.252 --> 09:55.439
SDS. And enough students on the campus Of course, 
we weren't having a whole lot of students vote in

09:59.347 --> 10:05.537
the election.

10:07.040 --> 10:12.649
And one of their protests of not voting in the 
election was they didn't have anybody they wanted

10:07.040 --> 10:12.649
to vote for. But one of the members of the SES was the 
daughter of one of the university professors. A

10:23.387 --> 10:25.911
very fine family, and she's a very fine person. for 
she just held that the university's position on

10:26.482 --> 10:36.934
some of the issues ought to be addressed and 
something done about it. They would stage sit-ins

10:37.936 --> 10:42.801
in the building sometime. They would have a 
demonstration. If a recruiter came to the campus,

10:46.906 --> 10:50.250
they'd have protests.

10:52.393 --> 10:56.117
If the recruiter were representing something 
that some of the areas that contributed to the war

10:56.738 --> 11:04.990
effort, they would have a protest. And the 
university, I think pretty soon, got to the point

11:05.010 --> 11:20.232
that as long as they don't block any passageways, 
as long as they don't disrupt an activity, as long

11:05.010 --> 11:20.232
as they're orderly, let them sit there. And 
occasionally you'd find one individual that

11:21.294 --> 11:25.480
would be causing a little bit of trouble and we'd 
just have to get them out of the building. And that

11:32.213 --> 11:39.842
was handled by the University Police and handled 
very cautiously and very considerately. I did not

11:40.503 --> 11:53.177
see on the University campus during the years that 
I was there and during the height of the activism

11:40.503 --> 11:53.177
and demonstrations, I didn't see what I would 
consider active violence. I saw had some of the

11:56.003 --> 12:06.898
tear gas get in my eyes when I'd be on the campus and 
sit in at the Student Union one time. They couldn't

12:07.980 --> 12:16.892
get the protesters to come out, so they used the 
tear gas or mace and got them out of there. But this

12:17.573 --> 12:22.720
was, I guess, as much violence as I witnessed 
there. the tires on a couple of university cars

12:23.206 --> 12:32.498
were slashed and they were flat when they came out 
to take them away. But the university, I think, saw

12:34.360 --> 12:46.956
that some of its rules and regulations needed 
examination. There's one in particular that

12:46.976 --> 12:51.762
marijuana, by the way, drugs became an issue, and 
it was believed that one of the places where a lot of

12:52.130 --> 13:12.253
the use of marijuana and other drugs was pretty 
rampant was among the representatives of the SDS

12:52.130 --> 13:12.253
group. Now that's not to say that there weren't 
others doing it as well, but they

13:21.239 --> 13:46.376
had some people that got into trouble with drugs, 
and the regents established

13:21.239 --> 13:46.376
a very strict rule that says a student who is found 
in possession of, making any use of, marijuana or

13:21.239 --> 13:46.376
any other drug would be expelled from the 
university. And so for a few months and maybe a year

13:47.197 --> 13:50.402
or two, the students who were involved on campus or 
off campus with marijuana or other drugs,

13:51.040 --> 14:06.457
hallucinatory drugs, would be expelled from the 
university. And I just automatically, in our

14:06.477 --> 14:14.986
office, administered that

14:06.477 --> 14:14.986
preservation of the regulation. But we went to 
court.

14:21.128 --> 14:25.072
And the university lost that case. That was too 
strong and too rigid and didn't take room for the

14:26.353 --> 14:50.038
first offender, and it didn't take room for a 
person who just maybe was caught up in an

14:26.353 --> 14:50.038
atmosphere where it could be said that they just 
was led into it. coerced into it. So that rule was

14:52.224 --> 14:53.767
changed.

14:58.294 --> 15:06.228
Another issue that, of course, had been mentioned 
was the minority enrollment. The university

15:06.248 --> 15:16.785
hired a Mrs. Duren, a black woman, a very fine white 
woman, to represent the black students' causes on

15:06.248 --> 15:16.785
the campus. She was known as an advocate or an 
ombudsman, but her sole responsibility was to

15:17.457 --> 15:35.303
listen to, counsel, encourage, do whatever she 
could to promote the black students' interests

15:17.457 --> 15:35.303
and concerns. And she did a fine job. And I think, 
generally speaking, the people on the university

15:38.768 --> 15:47.380
campus were interested in promoting enrollment 
of the blacks, encouraging them to come. And I,

15:55.097 --> 16:15.055
during the thirteen years I was there, I was 
involved with the orientation programs for the

15:55.097 --> 16:15.055
new students, and I would make it a point to meet all 
the students, and I specifically would go to the

16:15.558 --> 16:31.959
black students, the Spanish students, any 
students that were not Anglo, and I would try to

16:15.558 --> 16:31.959
make them feel welcome. But I noticed in the last 
few years, and I always had to make the overture,

16:31.979 --> 16:45.497
but I noticed the last two or three years that I was 
there, the black students were making overtures

16:31.979 --> 16:45.497
toward me. They'd see me stand over there and find 
out I was associated with the university, and

16:45.967 --> 16:56.339
they'd come over there and they'd say, what's your 
job, what do you do, what, so on and so forth. So I

16:56.359 --> 17:00.905
found a more relaxed atmosphere. That's not to say 
that they've ever until now achieved the kind of

17:02.286 --> 17:15.282
enrollment for the blacks that they need to have or 
want to have. But there was a great change while I

17:15.937 --> 17:21.383
was there. And of course, as you say that, you may be 
telling about the change that one goes through

17:21.963 --> 17:29.010
himself. I had the experience of working with 125 
black people in the Navy. And I found out that while

17:35.157 --> 17:42.784
I was working to try to get to know them, I was 
learning a lot about myself. And so I think that

17:43.465 --> 17:45.387
would be true of the experience there.

17:52.342 --> 17:57.770
Alright, are there any specific problems or 
violations with SES that you remember? Yes, the

17:58.752 --> 18:14.496
one that comes to my mind first is that Vice 
President, presidential candidate Hubert

17:58.752 --> 18:14.496
Humphreys was to speak in the city auditorium in 
Austin on Sunday. And on Saturday, the SDS

18:15.370 --> 18:34.709
organization held a rally up on the mall, the West 
Mall of the campus, getting organized for a

18:15.370 --> 18:34.709
protest at the Hubert Umpress speaking downtown. 
And they were charged by the university through

18:34.729 --> 18:42.357
the student organization's office. they were 
charged for having an unauthorized rally, and

18:42.927 --> 18:52.278
they were taken before a committee. And of course, 
the position of the SDS and those who argued and

18:53.059 --> 19:05.474
they were hacked was that that was prohibiting 
Iraq to assemble. But the university had some

19:05.494 --> 19:12.242
stated rules and regulations

19:13.218 --> 19:30.914
demonstrations on the campus about use of 
university facilities, and they had to drop off a

19:13.218 --> 19:30.914
piece of paper that would indicate that they were 
going to have this happening, this event on the

19:13.218 --> 19:30.914
campus, and they didn't do that. And so there was a 
great deal of problem of getting a committee. We

19:39.742 --> 19:42.685
had a list of thirty faculty members from which we 
could pick three faculty members and two students

19:43.238 --> 19:53.827
from the student list that formed the committee to 
hear the case. And with the help of some of the

19:54.788 --> 20:12.503
activist professors, the students representing 
the SDS, they eliminated 27 of the faculty

19:54.788 --> 20:12.503
members, to call a name. that's in the legal terms, 
they call it pre-entry. That's not the word.

20:22.802 --> 20:24.244
Pre-entry, I guess it may be. Pre-empt to 
challenge. And it means you could challenge

20:27.408 --> 20:31.714
without cause and get rid of this fellow, that 
fellow. But the final one to the hearing, and it was

20:32.455 --> 20:43.570
a lengthy one, and I think I mentioned on the tape 
about the man who wouldn't put his cap on. But

20:44.579 --> 21:05.886
then the records that you found suggest that they 
were kicked off of the campus for some regulation

20:44.579 --> 21:05.886
violation and were off from April to November or 
something like that. I don't remember the

21:05.906 --> 21:12.595
specifics of that, but it may well be that as a 
result of their unauthorized assembly. Failure

21:17.474 --> 21:27.447
to have permission,

21:17.474 --> 21:27.447
they were put off and then allowed to come back in 
November. As a result of this experience, the

21:28.728 --> 21:40.023
university set up a free speech area. There's an 
area on the campus, and it happened to be the West

21:41.819 --> 21:54.056
Mall where the demonstration had been held when 
they were to go down to the auditorium and protest

21:41.819 --> 21:54.056
on Prince Pete's. That area was designated, and 
still the students or student organizations were

21:54.556 --> 22:08.896
to come by and reserve that time so there wouldn't 
be two or three groups at the same time. So the

22:08.916 --> 22:10.358
procedure was You could use it any time you wanted 
to, for whatever purpose you wanted to, student

22:10.793 --> 22:17.507
organization. But they had, they had known in the 
Student Activities Office.

22:31.194 --> 22:32.076
Sorry to disdain you.

22:35.448 --> 22:44.077
Could you discuss the university rules and 
regulations, and do you feel they restricted

22:35.448 --> 22:44.077
individual rights for the students? Well, let's 
talk about regulations generally. I think it's

22:49.062 --> 23:04.138
incumbent upon a college or university to have 
some stated goals, some academic goals, and have

22:49.062 --> 23:04.138
some rules and regulations concerning academic 
matters. And I think it's appropriate to have some

23:04.692 --> 23:14.322
rules and regulations concerning the students' 
conduct and behavior. Now, of course, one of the

23:15.023 --> 23:24.773
most debated issues in recent years has been the 
hair and dress. And students' schools are still,

23:25.694 --> 23:30.919
some of them today, saying your hair cannot be any 
longer than touching the collar and so on. But they

23:36.159 --> 23:48.994
found that they just can't win those in court over 
and over again in trying to say how long your hair's

23:36.159 --> 23:48.994
got to be or how you have to dress. But I think you 
have to have some rules, some expectations that

23:49.755 --> 24:00.788
the university states in its general catalog is 
why it's usually found. expectations of the

24:01.240 --> 24:21.379
student, and I think the protest movements have, 
in general, moved the universities and colleges

24:01.240 --> 24:21.379
into a more open field and more open atmosphere. 
And, of course, with life, where you gain

24:22.320 --> 24:29.307
something, you give up something. And I think that 
some of the rules that were considered

24:29.978 --> 24:51.322
restrictive by some students, they're actually 
rules that the purpose by which they were

24:29.978 --> 24:51.322
formulated are still genuine and good. But when a 
student wants to do their own thing or a person

24:51.983 --> 24:58.230
wants to do his own thing, They have to realize that 
each area, each of our lives, and each environment

24:58.987 --> 25:12.249
in which we find ourselves has some expectations. 
And it could well be said, I think, that

25:12.950 --> 25:25.450
traditionally

25:12.950 --> 25:25.450
the teachers took the place of the parents The 
colleges and universities said, bring your son or

25:26.122 --> 25:35.371
daughter, sons and daughters to us and we'll look 
after them. And so the parents had come to expect

25:36.413 --> 25:46.803
that, some of them, and so there has to be rules. 
There needs to be as much freedom of choice as can be

25:47.164 --> 25:55.352
given within the framework of the mission of a 
college or university. Now, I happen to hold the

26:00.097 --> 26:07.764
notion that it's all right to teach right and 
wrong. It's all right to say it's wrong to lie. It's

26:10.487 --> 26:11.488
wrong to steal. It's wrong to cheat. And some 
people say, well, that's none of your business.

26:15.431 --> 26:23.439
But if someone is cheating in the classroom, there 
has to be rules and regulations to govern that.

26:24.119 --> 26:25.761
There's someone's behavior. as interfering with 
the rights of others, there has to be some rule and

26:26.213 --> 26:34.922
regulation and procedure and machinery to deal 
with it. So I think that the intent of a rule should

26:35.423 --> 26:52.441
be to give the individual student the right to grow 
and develop as much as they can on their own, but

26:35.423 --> 26:52.441
there are certain limits. It's like the road sign. 
It's like the road map. When you get ready to

26:55.475 --> 27:02.784
travel, you take a road map and you plot out your 
course. And you learn where the rough places are in

27:03.866 --> 27:08.492
the road. And if there's a detour, you move around 
the detour. But I think that rules are not ugly

27:14.840 --> 27:20.246
words. Rules are not bad things. Now, the rules can 
be over-restricted, but I think freedom itself

27:23.065 --> 27:42.423
carries a lot of responsibility, and

27:23.065 --> 27:42.423
the university, colleges and universities have 
to have them. They have to update them, but the

27:42.584 --> 27:51.452
freedom to do one's own thing all the time is just 
not something that's available to all of us.

27:54.028 --> 28:10.287
There's an environment on the college or 
university campus that has to be structured in a

27:54.028 --> 28:10.287
rather orderly fashion, and that's what I would 
think about the rules and regulations.

28:13.370 --> 28:21.540
Do you think the rules and regulations the 
university had were appropriate for the times?

28:21.908 --> 28:33.224
No, no, because we didn't have any rules and 
regulations concerning use of space or free

28:21.908 --> 28:33.224
speech areas. We had to designate, needed to 
designate a place where students could assemble

28:35.046 --> 28:45.981
any time they wanted to. And I'm remembering, 
believing that They just made it known to the

28:51.170 --> 29:01.546
Activities Office that they would be holding a 
demonstration at 10 o'clock on West Mall on

28:51.170 --> 29:01.546
Wednesday. And so that if a crowd got up there, 
they'd be authorized, that is to say. That space

29:09.679 --> 29:11.381
had been reserved for them. So, yeah, they were 
pretty restrictive. And there were a lot of the

29:19.638 --> 29:28.906
can's and cannot's and do's and do not's that I 
think were, some of them were restricted. But the

29:29.847 --> 29:43.039
expectation

29:29.847 --> 29:43.039
on the part of an individual or a group to say, well 
I'll be able to go out and demonstrate anytime I

29:29.847 --> 29:43.039
want to on the campus. And many times there's an 
event going on on the campus, a lot of people on the

29:48.140 --> 29:52.226
campus, and it would interfere. It would 
interfere with that. Of course, I'm sure some

29:54.549 --> 30:08.169
colleges and universities would be tempted, and 
some of them may have, to select some free speech

29:54.549 --> 30:08.169
area that's pretty well out of sight, and that's 
not what the demonstrators want. They want to be

30:08.390 --> 30:13.557
out front where they can be seen.

30:15.865 --> 30:20.029
I guess I've already said it. Some of the 
restrictions were restricted and didn't maybe

30:20.069 --> 30:34.983
provide the kind of freedom that students should 
have, just like living in the dormitory. We used to

30:35.444 --> 30:45.113
require there that freshmen and sophomores had to 
live in the University of

30:46.645 --> 30:55.739
The housing where we used to supervise off-campus 
housing, the regents took us out of that. They

30:56.580 --> 31:01.567
said the students could live wherever they wanted 
to. When I first went to the university, a student

31:02.509 --> 31:13.986
lived at Ms. Adams' boarding house and hadn't paid 
the board bill, but she'd report it to us and we'd

31:02.509 --> 31:13.986
say, pay your board bill or you'll be dropped out of 
school.

31:21.972 --> 31:24.657
In order to stay in school, pay your board bill. And 
I could even, at the old store downtown, they could

31:24.677 --> 31:31.789
be barred from readmission until that bill was 
paid. Well, that was too much involvement in a

31:32.330 --> 31:38.961
person's private life.
