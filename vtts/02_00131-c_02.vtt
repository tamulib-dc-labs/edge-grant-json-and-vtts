You have to sacrifice something to get where you want to be.

00:07.712 --> 00:09.898
And I'm not sure what those sacrifices are going to entail.

00:09.978 --> 00:20.082
It's possible to keep coming up with new things that allow a lot of that to retain and to stay and to benefit from.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.125
It's going to be interesting.

00:22.165 --> 00:30.056
I'm really curious to see, and I think we'll, I think the next 10 years, 15 years will really play that role out.

00:30.237 --> 00:35.624
And I think we'll really have a clear direction of where this place is going at that point.

00:35.644 --> 00:36.365
Last question.

00:36.946 --> 00:39.890
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

00:40.591 --> 00:41.312
I love this place.

00:41.393 --> 00:42.294
I think it's wonderful.

00:43.616 --> 00:46.400
It's been a very defining part of my life.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.444
It's been a defining part of who I am.

00:49.863 --> 00:52.346
And I very, very much value that.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.850
And I'm very appreciative of that.

00:54.910 --> 01:01.619
This place has taught me a lot, not just the people, but the experiences sometimes come from the people.

01:01.699 --> 01:03.701
But it's just all been very important.

01:03.741 --> 01:11.311
And I don't know what I want to do, but I feel confident in a lot of the things that I've learned that allow me to be successful in the future.

01:11.612 --> 01:14.035
And that's special, and I appreciate that.

01:14.235 --> 01:18.621
And I feel like people here don't just

01:19.242 --> 01:20.383
They value something more.

01:20.424 --> 01:22.847
They value something, a quality of an individual.

01:23.508 --> 01:25.350
And that's, you know, that's special to me.

01:25.470 --> 01:36.605
I think when a person measures not just what's on paper but the quality of everything else that encompasses you, that's special because I think it means that we're very people-oriented.

01:37.806 --> 01:44.195
And that's something I think is very important and it's really, really set a standard, I think, for me.

01:45.196 --> 01:45.456
All right.

01:45.476 --> 01:46.077
Let's quit there.
