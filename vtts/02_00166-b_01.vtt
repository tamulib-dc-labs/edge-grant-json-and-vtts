00:04.351 --> 00:22.174
I stayed there four years through this Manpower Incorporated and then business kind of fell off and the company had to reorganize a little bit and let some of the people go on account of poor business.

00:22.508 --> 00:30.285
And I was let go at that time, but those four years I really enjoyed and I was ready to retire at that time.

00:30.305 --> 00:34.314
So from 1926 till what year?

00:34.334 --> 00:36.940
1970.

00:37.460 --> 00:37.801
Two.

00:38.221 --> 00:39.043
Oh, how marvelous.

00:39.143 --> 00:40.386
How marvelous.

00:41.187 --> 00:43.892
41, 40, 44 years.

00:43.952 --> 00:45.195
With GE.

00:45.816 --> 00:46.096
With GE.

00:46.116 --> 00:47.078
Oh, that is good.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.723
Okay, let's see.

00:49.803 --> 00:50.565
Back to A&M.

00:52.809 --> 00:54.372
Did...

00:54.352 --> 00:58.017
Did it make much difference then when you became a sophomore?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.962
Was life different for a sophomore than a freshman?

01:01.382 --> 01:02.183
Oh, yes.

01:02.203 --> 01:02.664
Oh, yes.

01:02.724 --> 01:07.151
I always lived in fear as a freshman, wondering what was going to happen next.

01:07.211 --> 01:13.960
But like I mentioned before, there was a little bit of hazing going on, but not much in the band.

01:14.101 --> 01:22.232
We were pretty busy with band practice or studies and things like that, and there wasn't too much time for having fun.

01:22.252 --> 01:24.055
I mean, that kind of fun.

01:25.148 --> 01:47.967
was the the band commander was that a key position then we had a there was a captain of the band which uh i guess it was just a good good leader somebody was a nice fellow that got along with everybody and i don't know how they appointed the the band commander captain

01:48.520 --> 01:56.375
Unless the band director and maybe some of the senior class would suggest somebody for the next year.

01:57.457 --> 02:00.242
And y'all called him band captain?

02:00.262 --> 02:00.623
Yes.

02:02.627 --> 02:07.055
Now, did y'all do as much hazing in the band as they did in the other?

02:07.276 --> 02:08.278
I don't think we did.

02:08.298 --> 02:10.562
In fact, I'm sure we didn't.

02:11.538 --> 02:16.944
There was, I remember some hazing going on in the band.

02:17.024 --> 02:20.808
I'd hear about some of it, but I never was bothered with it very much.

02:20.848 --> 02:23.631
What little bit there was, it wasn't serious.

02:23.651 --> 02:27.755
So as a sophomore, then you had somebody to come and clean your room up?

02:27.875 --> 02:28.396
Oh, sure.

02:30.037 --> 02:30.738
Sure I did.

02:30.758 --> 02:33.661
I wasn't very tough on them.

02:33.681 --> 02:41.089
I had a pretty good-sized paddle, but back behind it, I had a little 12-inch ruler.

02:41.407 --> 02:48.257
And I'd make out like I was going to paddle him with that big paddle, but when I actually touched him, I had that little ruler I paddled him.

02:48.277 --> 02:51.863
It stung a little, but that was all.

02:51.883 --> 03:04.782
Were there some special teachers or advisors or counselors that you remember now with great joy and gratitude, some people that really helped you?

03:06.972 --> 03:17.356
Well, one was mechanical engineering drawing that I liked very much, and I—the name was Mitchell, one of the professors.

03:17.496 --> 03:18.859
I liked him very much.

03:18.980 --> 03:26.196
The chemistry teacher I liked, Hodges, I believe was his name.

03:28.184 --> 03:30.528
Mayo, Tommy Mayo, the English teacher.

03:30.888 --> 03:32.070
Did you have a course from him?

03:32.852 --> 03:36.858
Yes, just one course was all one year.

03:40.424 --> 03:44.050
Can't remember his, the mechanical engineering

03:44.317 --> 03:45.759
Teacher was very good.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.201
I don't remember his name.

03:49.324 --> 03:54.470
Then we had a shop foreman in mechanical engineering.

03:56.954 --> 03:58.816
Well, that was woodworking.

03:58.876 --> 04:03.863
Then we had a foundry shop, which I liked very much.

04:03.883 --> 04:06.406
Civil engineering lab I liked very much.

04:06.666 --> 04:09.230
The course itself was interesting.

04:09.270 --> 04:10.932
I don't remember the teacher now.

04:11.418 --> 04:17.791
As you look back, what were the key courses, the most important courses for you as an engineer in the future?

04:19.815 --> 04:25.647
Well, all of them I took.

04:26.437 --> 04:43.692
were interesting and I guess the electrical engineering was the one that really benefited me mostly and actually the only electrical engineering course that I had was this one course which was basic electricity as well as I recall now.

04:44.513 --> 04:55.482
And along that line, which is off the main subject here, but in Tulsa I was called up by a company one day to come down to, they wanted to talk to me about some motors.

04:55.883 --> 05:04.932
They designed fire escapes and cranes, these cranes that run up and down a building, and they wanted some motors for a crane.

05:06.173 --> 05:13.460
I went down and interviewed them to talk with them, and lo and behold, there was a classmate of mine there, and I didn't know he was even in town.

05:14.721 --> 05:21.107
And we went ahead and transacted our business, and I guess now they decided what they wanted.

05:21.928 --> 05:24.490
But in the course of conversation,

05:24.976 --> 05:32.428
The man that owned the place found out that—well, I guess he already knew that this man that worked for him was a graduate of A&M.

05:32.448 --> 05:42.365
Then he found out I was a graduate, and after we had done our business, he said, well, now, you went to A&M, and I've got a fellow here that went to A&M.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.927
He said, what course did you study?

05:44.729 --> 05:46.832
And I said, mechanical engineering.

05:47.386 --> 05:49.709
And he said, well, that beats all I ever heard.

05:49.729 --> 05:58.138
He says, here you are, a mechanical engineer working for an electrical outfit, and I've got an agricultural engineer designing fire escapes and cranes.

05:58.739 --> 06:01.562
It's too bad everybody can't go to that university.

06:02.503 --> 06:03.444
That's the way he put it.

06:04.686 --> 06:05.967
Now, I got off the track there.

06:05.987 --> 06:06.288
Sorry.

06:06.308 --> 06:06.908
Oh, no.

06:07.389 --> 06:12.735
We're talking about faculty members and others that you remember with gratitude and pride.

06:13.171 --> 06:19.986
Did you ever go to somebody that you were broke or had a problem that you needed somebody to help you solve?

06:21.570 --> 06:23.073
I don't recall that I did.

06:23.113 --> 06:30.690
I should have gone to that teacher of calculus, but for some reason I never did.

06:31.396 --> 06:38.286
Did you by chance know young Tom Harrington, who was just... I knew of him, but I didn't know him very well.

06:38.987 --> 06:41.391
Because he was new to the chemistry department.

06:41.591 --> 06:43.974
Yeah, and he was very well thought of, too.

06:43.994 --> 06:44.655
I remember that.

06:44.896 --> 06:45.457
Is that right?

06:46.338 --> 06:46.478
Mm-hmm.

06:47.319 --> 06:47.680
Let's see.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.122
Some other individuals.

06:49.202 --> 06:50.684
Did you know Heine Weir?

06:51.165 --> 06:51.646
Yes.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.488
Well, not very well, but I knew him.

06:55.391 --> 06:58.095
In the football team, I knew...

06:58.598 --> 07:03.765
I wasn't a personal friend of mine, but the 12th man, Dr. King Gill.

07:03.785 --> 07:05.127
King Gill, he was there.

07:05.147 --> 07:10.495
I forget the name of the quarterback.

07:10.635 --> 07:14.961
He was from Bay City my senior year.

07:15.642 --> 07:17.325
I was then connected to New York.

07:19.347 --> 07:27.559
And on January the 1st that year, there was a team composed mostly of Southwestern Conference football players.

07:28.130 --> 07:30.796
The quarterback off A&M was there.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.264
Evans, I think, was the end, was there.

07:34.865 --> 07:36.950
Rags Matthews from SMU.

07:38.073 --> 07:39.396
There was a guy from TCU.

07:39.436 --> 07:40.959
They were all on the Western team.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.788
The whole Eastern team was the All-American guys.

07:45.342 --> 07:58.447
The Western team beat the All-American guys 21 to nothing, and the next morning, the New York Times said, gentlemen, in great big letters, about four or five exclamation points, they play football down in Texas.

07:59.288 --> 08:00.951
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

08:00.992 --> 08:03.657
It was mostly all Southwestern Conference guys.

08:05.099 --> 08:07.063
Okay, a very important question.

08:07.415 --> 08:14.987
Were you and the other students aware when it happened of the 12th man event?

08:16.189 --> 08:19.614
I don't think at the time we realized the importance of it.

08:20.395 --> 08:23.500
Now I wasn't at the game, but I was in school at the time.

08:25.122 --> 08:27.386
Because King Gill did not play.

08:27.626 --> 08:28.107
No.

08:28.357 --> 08:29.739
But he was ready to play.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.886
And I don't know for sure if he went down and put the uniform on or not.

08:35.046 --> 08:35.707
I think he did.

08:35.847 --> 08:39.091
I think he did, but I don't remember the details of that now.

08:39.472 --> 08:51.327
Now, Coach Anderson, later Colonel Andy, his son told me that one of the reasons he thought that Coach Bible told...

08:52.015 --> 08:56.622
Andy to go up and get Gill to come put his uniform on.

08:57.924 --> 09:09.681
Back at Mississippi College, where DX Bible had coached before he came to A&M, when Anderson was his assistant coach, they were playing Mississippi State.

09:10.983 --> 09:14.408
They were ahead the first time they'd ever been ahead of them.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.251
They were ahead of them 13 to nothing.

09:16.754 --> 09:20.198
Then in the second half, some of their players got hurt.

09:20.799 --> 09:24.303
They only had a small team there, 15-16.

09:25.584 --> 09:30.450
And for a few plays, they only had nine players on the field and 10.

09:31.431 --> 09:37.719
And during that time, Mississippi State scored two touchdowns and beat them 14-13.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.567
And he said that Coach Bible went over to Anderson and said, remember

09:45.425 --> 09:47.908
Four years ago, what happened to us?

09:47.928 --> 09:52.434
Go up there and get Gil to come put on his uniform.

09:53.255 --> 09:58.781
Now, what I've wondered is, what did Coach Bible say to Weir?

09:59.282 --> 10:03.167
Did he say, Weir, now you better do your best, or I'll put him in for you.

10:03.667 --> 10:06.671
I have no idea.

10:07.092 --> 10:07.632
Let's see.

10:09.755 --> 10:14.140
Tom Harrington, did you know Mr. Zachary, H.B.

10:14.160 --> 10:14.841
Zachary?

10:15.158 --> 10:17.161
He was a classmate of Harrington's.

10:18.002 --> 10:21.246
He was about my time.

10:21.327 --> 10:22.588
I think he was before me, though.

10:22.608 --> 10:26.634
I think he was class of 22 or 23, somewhere along now.

10:27.295 --> 10:30.539
But I don't know that I knew about him until later on.

10:31.521 --> 10:36.087
I think it was up when I was working for GEM in Oklahoma that I first heard of Zachary.

10:36.353 --> 10:38.335
being in this big construction company.

10:38.876 --> 10:46.084
All right, in your engineering courses, what were the new subjects that y'all were learning, the new technology?

10:49.087 --> 10:55.774
I guess primarily was turbine generators, why they did what they did.

10:55.834 --> 11:00.960
That and then

11:03.168 --> 11:05.591
I was trying to think what they might have been in chemistry.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.815
I don't recall anything particular then or in civil engineering either.

11:11.238 --> 11:19.629
Well, as you got out into the real world with GE, had A&M pretty well kept y'all up to date?

11:20.990 --> 11:23.093
Were y'all on the, were y'all?

11:23.113 --> 11:23.594
Oh, yes.

11:23.854 --> 11:25.356
You mean heard from the school?

11:25.476 --> 11:26.998
Yes, sir.

11:29.223 --> 11:37.773
I don't recall it got very much information except the whoever was heading up the former students association.

11:38.414 --> 11:38.854
McQuillan?

11:40.116 --> 11:40.556
McQuillan?

11:40.837 --> 11:41.618
McQuillan.

11:41.638 --> 11:42.499
Yeah, McQuillan.

11:42.579 --> 11:44.321
I kept in touch with him pretty well.

11:45.582 --> 11:59.078
And also in terms of what y'all had been taught, had y'all been taught when you saw how well the other the students from the other colleges were prepared, was A&M

11:59.412 --> 12:02.163
engineering preparation up to date?

12:06.078 --> 12:09.793
As far as I know it was

12:11.579 --> 12:21.412
I think I knew just about as much as any of the other college graduates that I associated with, and the work that I was doing at least, I got along about as well as they did.

12:22.353 --> 12:22.514
Okay.

12:22.754 --> 12:30.464
And I knew I was associated with a bunch of fellows from various universities over a lot of places.

12:32.607 --> 12:35.691
Let's see, the YMCA building was there.

12:36.012 --> 12:36.492
Yes.

12:36.512 --> 12:40.658
What all happened at the Y?

12:41.212 --> 12:46.638
I never—of course, the main thing that I went to the YMCA building for was Casey's.

12:47.520 --> 13:02.157
But I don't remember that I ever participated in very much that was going on in the Y. Up on, I think, the fourth floor, there was a place up there, a third floor, kind of a meeting room.

13:02.491 --> 13:09.040
And I guess my senior year I went up there more than any other time.

13:10.963 --> 13:20.036
But as far as I was concerned, there wasn't too much activity going on that I participated in at the Y. Was there a swimming pool then?

13:20.056 --> 13:20.897
No.

13:21.739 --> 13:23.862
Pool hall, bowling alley?

13:23.942 --> 13:24.803
I think it was...

13:24.783 --> 13:32.019
Maybe a bowling alley with two lanes there, but I believe that's all and I don't I don't know that I ever played there now.

13:32.059 --> 13:33.426
What did you do at Casey's?

13:35.043 --> 13:38.647
Get a drink Coca-Cola or ice cream soda or a dish of ice cream.

13:38.667 --> 13:39.588
That was mainly it.

13:40.409 --> 13:41.711
Just a meeting place.

13:42.291 --> 13:49.179
And did you earn all of your own money or did your... No, my family provided all of the tuition.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.865
And so you didn't work while you were... No, no.

13:54.165 --> 13:55.907
What about in the summers, what did you do?

13:57.008 --> 14:01.193
I worked on that dry dock in Galveston, I remember, one summer, the first summer.

14:01.814 --> 14:03.155
Or was that before I went there?

14:03.436 --> 14:04.577
I'm not sure now which.

14:04.996 --> 14:06.841
But after that, I did not do any work.

14:06.901 --> 14:09.046
I just took a vacation in the summertime.

14:09.788 --> 14:11.292
Was Guyon Hall built yet?

14:12.214 --> 14:13.257
Guyon Hall, yes.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.365
That was one of our main meeting places.

14:16.826 --> 14:20.676
Spiesa Hall at O'Neill and Guyon Hall at the other end, a military walk.

14:21.196 --> 14:27.266
And that's the most, that's the thing that I miss most about A&M, was a military walk.

14:27.346 --> 14:32.414
And I'm sorry today that that's not there today for the Cadet Corps to march down.

14:32.535 --> 14:34.798
I agree with you.

14:35.119 --> 14:36.341
That was the main street.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.463
That was the main street.

14:38.625 --> 14:40.828
Were there movies then in Guyon Hall?

14:42.150 --> 14:43.012
Once in a while.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.416
Paul Whiteman orchestra played there.

14:45.476 --> 14:46.257
Really?

14:46.357 --> 14:46.798
Yes.

14:47.707 --> 14:48.648
You went to hear them?

14:48.848 --> 14:49.609
I went to hear it.

14:50.269 --> 14:52.972
What was your impression of their music?

14:52.992 --> 14:53.873
Couldn't beat it.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.353
Wonderful.

14:55.154 --> 14:55.655
Wonderful.

14:56.636 --> 14:57.957
But now it wasn't a dance.

14:58.037 --> 14:58.918
It was just a concert.

14:58.938 --> 15:00.059
Just a concert, yes.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.661
And what else was there at Guyon?

15:03.302 --> 15:04.503
We used to go to church there.

15:04.523 --> 15:15.874
I don't think that I can remember the whole cadet corps marching into Guyon Hall, but that was not required on Sunday.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.623
I think he went to the individual churches around.

15:20.924 --> 15:23.948
Did y'all have religious emphasis week then?

15:24.008 --> 15:25.850
No, not that I recall.

15:26.270 --> 15:28.413
Did you go to church on Sunday up there?

15:28.773 --> 15:29.294
Not much.

15:29.814 --> 15:31.016
Did you sleep late on Sunday?

15:33.338 --> 15:33.538
Yep.

15:34.439 --> 15:35.300
Let's see.

15:36.642 --> 15:39.265
The basic attitude of Aggie students.

15:39.905 --> 15:44.190
Were they liberal, conservative, lazy, diligent?

15:44.660 --> 15:46.342
Describe a typical Aggie.

15:46.802 --> 15:50.946
I think most of them were there to get an education.

15:54.410 --> 15:57.893
I personally didn't see too much horseplay going on.

15:58.173 --> 16:06.081
I think they all were there for a purpose and primarily get an education.

16:07.122 --> 16:10.165
And there were country boys and city boys.

16:10.505 --> 16:13.148
Country boys and city boys and

16:13.887 --> 16:41.093
One thing they did do the freshman year, I don't know how they selected on who was going to do it, but there was a water tank there at the time, big water tank right there close to Milner Hall, and usually within the first week, the freshman class would get up there and paint out the previous year and put their class year number up there on that water tank, and the next night, just after taps, just after, well maybe it was after taps,

16:41.697 --> 16:48.786
You'd hear a big sound, air out freshmen, and boy, the freshmen tore out, and where they went for the rest of the night, nobody knows.

16:49.868 --> 16:56.496
But they were supposed to be gone because that new number was up there, and sometime you'd come back to it all.

16:56.717 --> 16:58.159
And you knew it was going to happen.

16:58.399 --> 17:02.324
You knew it was going to happen, but you didn't know when, but you often wondered.

17:02.765 --> 17:05.308
Did you all have silver taps in those days?

17:06.588 --> 17:16.420
We must have, but I don't recall that we had any particular significance to it.

17:18.202 --> 17:23.248
The same way the bonfire, for the sake of me, I can't remember them having bonfire when I was there.

17:24.410 --> 17:33.341
I can kind of remember there was something going on up at a little park close to what used to be the main entrance up there by the depot.

17:33.361 --> 17:36.004
Just inside there to the right there was a little park

17:37.064 --> 17:44.514
And there was once in a while some activity going on there, and I kind of think that that's where they had a little bonfire going on.

17:44.835 --> 17:50.603
That's the only place that I can remember, but I just can't remember the bonfire much.

17:50.923 --> 17:51.745
What about muster?

17:52.986 --> 17:54.749
I don't recall they had muster, either.

17:55.650 --> 18:00.617
Now, after I graduated, I went up to Tulsa, and I was up there 28 years.

18:01.959 --> 18:04.202
And, of course, I was away from the college,

18:04.368 --> 18:10.975
and I kind of lost contact with them until I moved back to Tulsa in 1955.

18:11.276 --> 18:17.583
All right, now the band, you all played for football games.

18:17.643 --> 18:17.883
Yes.

18:18.704 --> 18:21.047
Did everybody stand up?

18:21.067 --> 18:21.928
I don't think we did.

18:21.948 --> 18:23.269
I can't remember that we did.

18:23.670 --> 18:29.296
But we played for all the football and baseball games.

18:29.396 --> 18:30.898
Did y'all march in?

18:31.418 --> 18:32.460
Did the court march?

18:32.541 --> 18:34.806
I don't think we did, like I do today, no.

18:34.826 --> 18:36.109
Did you march at halftime?

18:37.152 --> 18:37.392
No.

18:39.437 --> 18:45.311
I say no.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.757
We must have marched some.

18:50.437 --> 18:52.700
Formed the T, I guess, was about all.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.502
I was wondering, you formed the T?

18:54.722 --> 18:57.706
Well, we must have formed the T, y'all.

18:58.527 --> 19:01.010
But I know we didn't go through all these things they have today.

19:03.253 --> 19:09.861
The, y'all did, did y'all march, did y'all play at final review?

19:10.461 --> 19:15.127
Yes, yes, played final review for the cadet corps to go through twice.

19:16.148 --> 19:18.351
Commencement, did the band...

19:19.377 --> 19:22.441
I don't recall that we did anything special for commencement.

19:23.442 --> 19:27.347
Do you think the band was held in high regard by the rest of the student body?

19:27.728 --> 19:28.990
I think so, yes.

19:29.230 --> 19:30.772
Were there singing cadets then?

19:30.792 --> 19:37.721
I think they were just beginning to form at that time, but it wasn't the organization it became later.

19:37.741 --> 19:44.490
Now one thing the band did while I was there, every year we went to Fort Worth for a week.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.835
were doing the Fat Stock Show up there.

19:47.195 --> 19:47.516
Oh.

19:47.536 --> 20:03.517
And the band gave two concerts daily at that Fat Stock Show, and Amon G. Carter was responsible for it, and he got people, citizens there, to take members of the band and let them stay in their homes.

20:03.998 --> 20:04.459
Oh.

20:04.479 --> 20:13.431
We stayed in people's homes, and one year, Tex Rickard,

20:14.018 --> 20:19.545
who was a big promoter in New York at the time, was taking a rodeo to England.

20:21.969 --> 20:28.818
And they, I understand, I didn't see it personally, but I understand that he got in touch with someone in College Station.

20:28.858 --> 20:36.448
He wanted to take the Aggie band to England to be the official rodeo band in England.

20:37.475 --> 20:47.452
But it came in about March, somewhere along there, and they decided they couldn't let the students go for that length of time and give them credit for their work.

20:48.253 --> 20:49.435
So we didn't go.

20:49.455 --> 20:51.138
Oh, that would have been fun.

20:51.278 --> 20:52.200
That would have been fun.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.063
That would have been fun.

20:55.706 --> 20:57.829
Did you all go on core trips then?

20:58.210 --> 20:58.791
Yes.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.294
We've made maybe two a year.

21:02.095 --> 21:06.318
Waco, Houston, and Austin.

21:07.319 --> 21:08.320
Fort Worth or Dallas?

21:08.821 --> 21:11.643
Yeah, we went Fort Worth and Dallas.

21:13.104 --> 21:13.805
How did you get there?

21:13.825 --> 21:17.288
I don't think we made, but about two core trips per year or something like that.

21:17.428 --> 21:18.569
One south, one north.

21:18.869 --> 21:20.311
Yeah, one on train.

21:23.373 --> 21:24.795
Did Aggies hitchhike then?

21:25.475 --> 21:26.036
Did what?

21:26.056 --> 21:27.377
Did you hitchhike then?

21:28.353 --> 21:29.194
Did we get what?

21:29.314 --> 21:30.756
Did you hitchhike?

21:31.277 --> 21:32.478
Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:33.600 --> 21:41.070
I never did, but a lot of the boys used to hitchhike from College Station to Houston or from there on north somewhere.

21:41.871 --> 21:47.678
Did you ever hear of anybody having a bad experience hitchhiking?

21:50.782 --> 21:56.790
No, but I remember one night, one of the fellows in the band was over at Bryan, and he...

21:57.462 --> 22:00.607
caught the freight train one night coming back.

22:01.068 --> 22:02.149
Uh-oh.

22:03.031 --> 22:15.550
He was a sophomore my freshman year, a fellow named Woods, Soupy Woods, and when he got out to College Station he tried to get off and he slipped and fell under the train and cut both of his legs off and they found him dead the next morning.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.493
Oh my, oh my.

22:17.513 --> 22:24.043
I don't remember what year that was, either 22 or 23, somewhere along there, and we

22:24.732 --> 22:33.760
Several of us, they got several of us to go with us at a funeral, to go to his funeral, which we did, several of the band members.

22:35.122 --> 22:37.684
Soupy Woods was his name.

22:37.704 --> 22:40.987
Was there a trolley, a streetcar then?

22:41.127 --> 22:42.048
Tunerville trolley.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.610
Where did you catch it?

22:44.170 --> 22:48.975
Right there close to Milner Hall, just across the street from Milner Hall.

22:49.615 --> 22:53.659
I guess the track came right on up to there and ended at that place.

22:53.926 --> 22:58.753
Just about where the little kind of a temple is there, a church.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.457
And it went to downtown?

23:01.617 --> 23:02.919
Yes, downtown Bryan.

23:03.119 --> 23:05.923
About how often did you go to downtown Bryan?

23:08.687 --> 23:09.789
Maybe twice a month.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.532
Well, my senior year may have been more than that.

23:12.633 --> 23:16.979
We'd go there and listen to those records that I mentioned to the music store.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.784
What else was there in downtown Bryan that seemed attractive?

23:20.904 --> 23:21.385
Movie.

23:22.090 --> 23:22.731
That was it.

23:23.894 --> 23:25.697
Mostly just movies going to the movies.

23:26.739 --> 23:35.256
Now, if you and your buddies wanted to have a good time on a Saturday night, what did y'all do?

23:39.067 --> 23:44.673
Tell you, for the sake of me, I can't remember anything in particular except just have a bull session somewhere.

23:46.295 --> 23:50.600
Could beer be, I know it was dry, but was there any bootlegger beer?

23:53.683 --> 23:56.146
I never saw it or I never participated in it.

23:56.847 --> 24:04.956
I've heard of some fellas having some bootleg there, as well as I recall now, but

24:05.408 --> 24:10.576
There was nothing like that goes on these days after we had prohibition left us.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.485
Did you know about any secret fraternities at A&M?

24:16.505 --> 24:19.249
There were two secret fraternities there.

24:19.730 --> 24:20.832
Well, tall beta pi.

24:20.852 --> 24:21.573
That was a nice thing.

24:21.633 --> 24:28.043
And I wanted to ask you when you were talking up there, you mentioned about fraternities and sororities, how many there were and what percentage of the class.

24:28.784 --> 24:32.530
And I wondered then whether you were speaking about the

24:33.843 --> 24:36.826
The social.

24:37.447 --> 24:42.473
Well, was it social or was it the, what do you call the students?

24:44.215 --> 24:45.917
Not the professional fraternity.

24:45.937 --> 24:46.498
Not the professional.

24:46.538 --> 24:48.080
Like I say, tall beta pi was there.

24:48.100 --> 24:51.684
Then they had one called the TTs, which I think was a football team.

24:51.744 --> 24:52.705
And then there was another one.

24:53.226 --> 24:54.027
The swastika.

24:54.067 --> 24:54.787
Swastika.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.650
But I don't know.

24:56.770 --> 24:58.652
I didn't know anything about either one of them.

24:58.672 --> 25:02.196
I think the TTs was the football players or the athletes.

25:02.615 --> 25:05.598
Now, the ones today are the social only.

25:05.958 --> 25:11.083
You know, they live in the fraternity house, live in a sorority house.

25:11.343 --> 25:30.462
I guess one reason I went to A&M was the fact that they didn't have fraternities there, and I knew that they had them at the University of Texas, and I guess I thought, well, I'm not socially inclined, maybe, and I don't know whether I want to go up there and get mixed up in that stuff or not.

25:30.931 --> 25:34.015
And I think that had some importance with my going to A&M.

25:34.035 --> 25:40.723
All right, in that inclusiveness, when you were there, were there any Jewish boys?

25:41.885 --> 25:45.449
Yes, not very many, and there was some Mexican boys, too.

25:47.131 --> 25:49.034
Some Catholics, some Protestants.

25:49.054 --> 25:49.134
Yes.

25:49.474 --> 25:50.636
How was everybody treated?

25:51.637 --> 25:54.080
About the same, equally, as well as I recall.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.241
No difference.

25:55.261 --> 25:56.503
Rich boys, poor boys?

25:56.703 --> 25:57.985
Rich boys, poor boys.

25:58.545 --> 25:59.807
Couldn't tell the difference, see.

26:00.175 --> 26:11.070
I remember the Mexican boys, their family came to visit them one day, and I happened to be down at the depot when they came, and those Mexican boys, they impressed me.

26:11.130 --> 26:13.594
They were so nice and polite to their parents.

26:14.595 --> 26:18.140
Seemed to me like more so, though, than the regular kids did.

26:20.423 --> 26:23.668
Where did you get a date as an Aggie then?

26:24.128 --> 26:24.809
Where did I get what?

26:24.949 --> 26:25.310
A date.

26:25.450 --> 26:26.892
How did an Aggie get a date?

26:27.361 --> 26:28.943
Well, I didn't date any.

26:30.345 --> 26:35.893
While I was there, I just, I don't know, I just had an occasion to try to date.

26:36.594 --> 26:44.765
Now, my senior year, I knew some people there, particularly my senior when playing an Aggieland band.

26:45.045 --> 26:52.435
We went over to Dean Bolton's house one night, five of us, and played a little, for a little party they were having.

26:52.495 --> 26:55.900
We provided a little music there.

26:59.727 --> 27:05.778
Then the Bryan girls, I never paid much attention to them until my senior year.

27:05.838 --> 27:08.563
Then they started congregating around the band a little bit.

27:09.364 --> 27:18.080
And there was Mary Jones and Katherine Henderson and two or three of them that I became acquainted with doing these dances.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.304
They'd come over and talk with us as a band song.

27:21.025 --> 27:23.389
And then my senior year I had

27:23.825 --> 27:31.337
there was some dance, senior dance or an RV dance or something, and I invited a young lady from Galveston to come up

27:31.705 --> 27:37.496
to the dance and she stayed in the home of one of these girls that I had become acquainted with.

27:38.517 --> 27:51.682
And I have regretted all my life, I can't remember, of ever going back over to that house and thanking those people for letting that young lady stay there for that dance.

27:52.243 --> 27:55.789
And it pops in my mind every once in a while, I think,

27:57.035 --> 28:00.900
Unappreciated could a person be not to go back over there and thank them.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.243
But that's the way it goes, I guess.

28:05.866 --> 28:08.570
Did you go to any of the dances and dance?

28:10.032 --> 28:13.356
I couldn't dance at that time, to be perfectly frank with you.

28:13.736 --> 28:18.963
I didn't learn to dance until after I got to playing with this dance band and kind of got on to how it was done.

28:18.983 --> 28:23.008
And from then on, after I finally caught on, I enjoyed it.

28:23.933 --> 28:26.277
Let's see.

28:26.878 --> 28:30.022
I'm looking at their steam tunnel.

28:30.062 --> 28:32.606
Were there any steam tunnels on the campus then?

28:33.388 --> 28:38.936
I've heard others talk about steam tunnels, and they could go from building to building in the steam tunnel.

28:38.956 --> 28:40.118
Not that I know of.

28:40.959 --> 28:43.683
There must have been, though, to get heat from around there.

28:44.425 --> 28:46.928
But I didn't know about any tunnels there.

28:47.549 --> 28:48.010
Let's see.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.873
Did you know Pinky Downs?

28:50.427 --> 28:51.228
I knew of him.

28:51.529 --> 28:52.730
He was ahead of my time.

28:55.174 --> 29:03.345
He was mentioned quite frequently at some of the Yale practices before football games and things.

29:03.465 --> 29:06.229
His name was brought up a lot.

29:07.190 --> 29:12.978
And the trips that people took, were they called core trips?

29:12.998 --> 29:14.140
Yes.

29:14.542 --> 29:17.986
And did you all march down the main street?

29:18.226 --> 29:18.526
Yes.

29:19.728 --> 29:23.432
And nobody ever threw things at you or you were treated nicely?

29:23.452 --> 29:24.513
No, not that I recall.

29:26.515 --> 29:36.526
We'd, well, I mean, the cadet corps would stack their rifles and then we'd guess, well, of course, we took our band instruments with us to play in the stadium.

29:37.748 --> 29:39.790
But we never had any trouble the year.

29:40.597 --> 29:50.735
The next year after I graduated, it was a very unfortunate situation there at Baylor, which I guess everybody knows about and finally forgot about, but that was a terrible accident there.

29:51.256 --> 29:56.365
Did you ever have any amusing incident on any of the Corps trips?

29:57.527 --> 29:59.010
Anything goofy happen?

30:01.083 --> 30:12.402
No, not that I can recall, except some of the fellows would hide on the train going up to the court trip.

30:13.043 --> 30:17.951
Somebody would help them hide underneath their legs or something, and the conductor wouldn't look too hard.

30:18.092 --> 30:19.875
So they didn't have to buy a ticket?

30:19.895 --> 30:21.758
They didn't have to buy a ticket, right.

30:21.898 --> 30:24.222
They'd moot their way that way.

30:24.202 --> 30:30.510
On those at a football game, were they called yell leaders then?

30:31.331 --> 30:31.612
Yes.

30:31.972 --> 30:37.700
And were the yells that we do now similar, the same yells?

30:37.720 --> 30:44.088
No, they were, I think the words of some of them were the same, but they were done in a different way.

30:45.850 --> 30:51.117
It was just a different cadence than they have today.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.280
What did the yell leaders wear then?

30:53.733 --> 30:58.239
As well as I recall, very similar to what they wear today, just white shirts and pants.

30:58.659 --> 30:59.080
Okay.

30:59.840 --> 31:05.367
And the Ross Volunteers, they were... They were there.
