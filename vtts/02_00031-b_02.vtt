WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:06.322
Did you all ever do any research relating to the 
dairy industry, perhaps an ice cream? We never did

00:07.965 --> 00:16.856
anything with dairy because dairy is not exactly a 
hot topic in this particular area. See, I thought

00:18.218 --> 00:23.325
there might be an ice cream business in Washington 
County that might have had some link. We are very

00:23.485 --> 00:29.633
protective of the ice cream business, and we don't 
want to cast anything. dispersion of dairy cattle

00:29.950 --> 00:33.736
to have any problem. They don't all live in 
Washington County. As you look back now I'm

00:37.402 --> 00:53.747
serious again, as you look back on your years as 
department head, were there any research

00:37.402 --> 00:53.747
possibilities that were overlooked, but you now 
realize Oh, wish we'd done this or that?

00:58.199 --> 01:06.727
We did about all we could do because research 
depended mainly upon somebody supporting it.

01:07.047 --> 01:17.696
That, of course, comes from the fact that the 
university thinks that it should be funded

01:07.047 --> 01:17.696
research if it's going to be important. And I was 
told very strongly one time that we're doing

01:18.677 --> 01:23.341
research. We're studying natural diseases. 
We're publishing. And they said, well, that

01:27.207 --> 01:37.800
doesn't count, because if it doesn't bring money 
in, then it's not important. I personally was

01:38.802 --> 01:42.166
impatient. Some of my faculty did not perceive 
that the university members should have a

01:42.306 --> 01:55.543
curiosity and wish to pursue new knowledge, 
because they didn't feel that way, I guess. So I

01:56.266 --> 01:58.928
think there were opportunities that were lost 
there. During your years as department head,

02:00.330 --> 02:13.401
about what percentage of the budget for the 
department came from outside funding, outside

02:00.330 --> 02:13.401
the university? I don't have any figures on that. 
In the

02:18.646 --> 02:24.771
middle 70s, we had a considerable budget, and I 
don't remember how many positions we had that were

02:26.168 --> 02:36.823
paid out of research, but there were five or six, I 
think. All right, and those outside sources, what

02:37.724 --> 02:42.030
were some of them? Well, we had support, like I told 
you, from the Kleberg Foundation, the National

02:43.292 --> 02:50.081
Institute for Health. There were several 
programs with that around storage, had stuff on

02:54.974 --> 02:59.478
neurologic disease and pathogenesis of that. I 
don't know if you know what pathology and

03:00.319 --> 03:04.223
pathogenesis are the key word. How does it come 
about? And if you know how it comes about, then you

03:06.045 --> 03:12.210
know how to interact with it. And we have worked, 
did some other work in collaboration with others.

03:17.255 --> 03:23.361
Adams, for example, worked with a disease in 
horses. that eating a type of Johnson grass that

03:23.982 --> 03:30.788
causes the inflammation of the bladder. And then 
what it really tied down to was that it was a form of

03:31.649 --> 03:38.935
prussic acid poisoning. Horses being unique, 
like cattle, it affects their blood. And they have

03:46.622 --> 03:52.167
the oxygen carrying capacity, so they die from an 
oxygen. But in horses, it's a slow process that

03:52.940 --> 03:58.748
affects the nerves. And we worked that out fairly 
well. And I thought it was an excellent experiment

04:02.313 --> 04:17.956
in the study of disease, although that disease is 
not highly important, except it's important to

04:02.313 --> 04:17.956
horse people to try to raise their horses on. What 
was it that you did your masters on? That was just a

04:21.745 --> 04:28.493
study of the relationship of bacteria to renal 
disease. Was there anybody in the department that

04:28.513 --> 04:35.241
was the most successful grant getter, outside 
funding getter?

04:40.988 --> 04:42.069
That would be hard to say. We had a program which 
finally

04:42.910 --> 04:51.600
worked as a In collaboration with the Parks and 
Wildlife, we developed a wild animal season

04:52.441 --> 05:07.492
program that came in and did very well and that was 
finally integrated with the Institute of

04:52.441 --> 05:07.492
Tropical Veterinarian Medicine. There's a 
frequency of people trying to reorganize things.

05:14.243 --> 05:23.752
The doctoral program was in existence when you 
became department head, and it grew to about how

05:14.243 --> 05:23.752
many students per year during your? I think we had 
12 to 13 at one time. So you'd have three, four, five

05:28.677 --> 05:34.603
degrees doctoral per year completed? Yeah, that 
time off took five, six years. It depends on the

05:39.187 --> 05:44.132
aggressiveness of the individuals and their 
resourcefulness. That's probably how it

05:45.158 --> 05:50.062
arrived, I guess. And the department's funding 
came partly from the Ag Experiment Station? After

05:56.528 --> 06:13.984
I became department head and soon after, well, 
when Ballantyne came, he set up a department of

05:56.528 --> 06:13.984
veterinary science, which worked through the 
Experiment Station. And finally then that was

06:14.791 --> 06:19.077
broken up into departments. It was only after I 
became department head, Hilton Smith had a little

06:19.999 --> 06:33.979
problem with the Experiment Station because of 
his prior experience with them, and he refused to

06:19.999 --> 06:33.979
work with them except on his terms. And so then Al 
set that up and put me part-time at the Experiment

06:35.121 --> 06:42.351
Station, and we started And it was a significant 
part then in later years. Any from the Extension

06:51.154 --> 06:52.836
Service? We really haven't had any relationship 
with Extension Service, per se. Were there any

06:59.304 --> 07:04.691
other state agency funding sources? Yes, we had 
$40,000 to $50,000, which today multiplied that

07:05.652 --> 07:12.000
today in the We had studied the diseases of deer and 
things like that, and Mick Robinson started it.

07:23.053 --> 07:26.616
One individual left, and then Mick Robinson took 
it over. Any research that you remember as really

07:28.277 --> 07:37.425
fun, pleasant, really enjoyable? The research 
that I did, I enjoyed. was that study of natural

07:42.068 --> 07:44.651
disease. And that, where you take what's there and 
try to figure it out. And I think the fossilization

07:50.337 --> 07:54.662
problem was one. Another thing we did with the 
physiology was on what they call crazy cow

07:54.682 --> 08:00.048
disease. And that was a selenium toxicity. And on 
selenium, the species included tomato and

08:04.353 --> 08:09.358
potato. And they have solanins that are in there 
that force in the nervous system. And working that

08:18.056 --> 08:21.760
out.

08:24.002 --> 08:34.994
Ken had a project that he worked on, on his 
dissertation on a project on hip dysplasia of

08:24.002 --> 08:34.994
dogs, about chemistry of that in relation to 
hormones. And the problem with that was that to not

08:39.713 --> 08:44.582
become fun because it was such a logistic problem 
raising dogs. We had about 300 dogs, Walker and

08:44.602 --> 08:52.658
American Foxhounds out there at one time. And like 
I say, that's not fun. When you retired in 76 as

08:55.664 --> 09:02.397
department head? Oh, yeah, in 77. 77. When you 
retired in 77, do you think that veterinary

09:06.105 --> 09:18.884
pathology nationally, our veterinary pathology 
program, would have been the highest ranked of the

09:06.105 --> 09:18.884
veterinary programs here? In ranking 
nationally, I would say within the top four. And

09:26.757 --> 09:27.658
who were the others? I think Cornell and Michigan.

09:32.650 --> 09:33.852
Okay. And Colorado wasn't bad. Would there have 
been anybody else, any other department, any

09:35.835 --> 09:41.803
program here in the top three, four, five?

09:47.973 --> 09:51.338
The graduate programs would be hard to relate. The 
programs in focal diseases were strong as far as

09:51.558 --> 10:00.531
the research and the individual students, but 
they didn't have the PSD programs. Dr.

10:00.950 --> 10:21.788
Price retired in the early 70s, and we looked for a 
new dean and ended up bringing back from Missouri a

10:00.950 --> 10:21.788
man that had gone to school at Texas A&M. Do you 
remember that search?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.075
For dean? Mm-hmm. I don't remember any in 
particular detail. All right. How did you all feel

10:38.125 --> 10:40.748
when Dr. Shelton was selected? I thought I was 
pleased, basically. George is not a hard person to

10:45.693 --> 10:58.446
get along with, and sometimes that was his fault.

10:59.101 --> 11:01.606
I think we did well with George.

11:05.272 --> 11:08.759
Everybody has their own peculiarities and you 
perceive them differently. I was chairman of that

11:08.779 --> 11:21.542
committee, so I'm... Well, I figured that the 
reason he was selected because the board of

11:08.779 --> 11:21.542
directors from his hometown picked him. Oh, I 
hadn't thought about that, no. Those things

11:24.953 --> 11:29.620
always come up, Haskell, you know that. Typist, 
this can be an editorial note. When I went in as

11:33.306 --> 11:53.256
chairman of the search committee, I went in to Dr. 
Williams as president to report to him and Vice

11:33.306 --> 11:53.256
President Calhoun, and I had gone back personally 
to each of the subgroups that had been involved in

11:33.306 --> 11:53.256
the interview process. the faculty 
representative, the student representatives,

11:54.383 --> 12:00.172
the former student representatives, U 
department heads, and so forth. And I'd ask each

12:00.612 --> 12:05.239
group to rate all of the interviewees. And it was my 
fault, I now realize it was foolish, my fault that

12:05.580 --> 12:12.971
we had interviewed eight prospective deans. 
That's far too many. Shouldn't have had that many.

12:16.116 --> 12:22.365
But I had them each rate and gave eight points to the 
one they ranked first and right on down. There were

12:22.480 --> 12:26.185
two that came out far above all the others. A man who 
had been for a couple of years the dean at Ohio

12:27.527 --> 12:45.474
State, and then he literally told them to take the 
job and shove it, and he had left Ohio State in real

12:27.527 --> 12:45.474
anger, and they were angry at him and he was angry at 
them, and he had gone to Georgia just as a faculty

12:27.527 --> 12:45.474
member. And the other one was Dr. Shelton. And in my 
summary to President Williams, I said, oh, this

12:49.109 --> 12:56.898
man that's now in Georgia, he'll be exciting. Now, 
there'll be all kinds of things. You know,

12:59.180 --> 13:00.522
there'll be explosions. There'll be anger. But I 
mean, that place will really be hopping. He said,

13:05.167 --> 13:07.489
tell me about this other man. I said, well, I think 
he's calm. He's methodical. People can work with

13:12.127 --> 13:13.688
him. He will work well, but quietly sort of, out 
there with the former students. He'll work with

13:20.274 --> 13:22.616
the various constituencies. And Dr. Williams 
quickly said, let's go with this second guy. He

13:26.099 --> 13:28.361
said, I've got enough damn excitement in my life.

13:33.086 --> 13:40.412
Were there any changes in style from Dean Price to 
Dean Shelton? any way that the dean's office did

13:42.265 --> 13:45.528
things? I don't remember much change.

13:52.035 --> 14:00.183
I perceive that Dr. Sheldon was a little more 
student-oriented

13:52.035 --> 14:00.183
than Al. Al was rather pragmatic, and as I told you 
before, he was a manager and a leader. That was the

14:09.873 --> 14:24.651
only difference I saw, and Doc Sheldon was 
depending a lot more on opinions than Al did. And he

14:24.671 --> 14:27.314
met regularly with you, department heads? Now who 
under Dean Price, was there an associate dean?

14:35.135 --> 14:37.538
Wallace Bay. Wallace Bay was the last. No, 
Shelton. Shelton selected him. Oh, Shelton? Oh,

14:46.850 --> 14:47.611
no, I know. Lyndon Kurtz was with Al, but he was not a 
veterinarian. Jack Murray was assistant dean.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.541
Oh, okay. Was there anybody who was clearly the 
second in command? That's what I was asking, where

14:58.685 --> 15:00.648
I'm headed. Under Dean Price? Dean Price?

15:08.311 --> 15:16.326
Well, until he appointed a dean of research there 
wasn't, I think. Who was that? Fred Mauer. Fred

15:19.391 --> 15:20.473
Mauer. Oh, yeah, M-A-U-R-E-R.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.725
Otherwise, I joked when I say the secretary. All 
right. Then when Dean Shelton, Joy Shelton, he

15:28.492 --> 15:40.128
soon appointed Wally Bay as the associate dean. He 
took him out of pathology. Don't pull that coffee

15:43.212 --> 15:46.937
cup off if it's got coffee in it. No, he didn't. He 
took him out of pathology. Yeah. Had you hired Dr.

15:50.381 --> 15:51.883
Bay? Describe him and his manner and style. a quiet 
gentleman of all, and a very congenial person, and

15:57.755 --> 16:13.531
as loyal an associate as you'd want to be the best 
next to me. Right. And in the way the leadership

16:14.072 --> 16:25.804
operated, if Dean, if you needed an answer and you 
could not contact Dean Shelton, Could Wally Bay

16:26.257 --> 16:28.279
answer for him? Could he say yes or no? I don't know 
that I ever tested that. Wallace would go along a

16:36.407 --> 16:50.701
lot and Doc Sheldon, he would ask opinions and kind 
of lead discussions and things like that and

16:36.407 --> 16:50.701
decisions would be made. I never perceived that 
Wallace took to a firm directorship of anything.

16:58.860 --> 17:21.627
During all of your years on the faculty in 
veterinary medicine, do you remember any

16:58.860 --> 17:21.627
big complaints or examples of displeasure by the 
public out there wanting veterinary medicine to

16:58.860 --> 17:21.627
do something that they thought they weren't 
doing?

17:22.045 --> 17:25.169
There was always a problem with a selection 
committee. Oh, and admissions? Oh, yeah. Those

17:29.554 --> 17:39.906
things, and I think that occasionally something 
would happen with the clinic that people were

17:29.554 --> 17:39.906
upset with. Other than that, I don't remember 
anything. I don't remember anything. Yeah. We

17:50.395 --> 17:57.105
were told in a way, politically, we were told to 
keep our hands off. And we really then, the program

17:59.187 --> 18:05.436
in veterinary medicine is you work with the 
practitioners. And that's basically it. Some

18:06.979 --> 18:08.621
people will bring animals in. All right. During 
your entire experience, how did the profession of

18:10.163 --> 18:17.854
veterinary medicine in Texas change? What were 
the major shifts? Well, I think it became a lot more

18:22.706 --> 18:33.055
sophisticated and international than they 
expected.

18:33.916 --> 18:39.621
Actually, we produced quite a few graduates 
during this time. I remember that 64 and then 128

18:39.641 --> 18:48.128
veterinarians and they began to, I think, in a way 
saturate the and of course those people were more

18:48.800 --> 18:51.423
innovative. They went into different fields. I 
think it was put into public health and things of

18:55.628 --> 19:02.276
this nature.

19:03.918 --> 19:10.285
And all things change, and I think modernization, 
you might say, is the essence of it. They also went

19:11.243 --> 19:16.008
into more exotic animals and birds, didn't they? 
Oh, yeah. I guess the biggest thing to me was the

19:18.931 --> 19:26.599
development of equine practitioners, for 
example.

19:31.424 --> 19:36.829
Give some examples of some of the most unusual

19:40.775 --> 19:46.742
animals or research or whatever it might be that 
you remember dealing with yourself. There must

19:47.803 --> 19:53.130
have been some very unusual problems y'all had to 
solve. Mick Robinson had a very interesting one

19:54.251 --> 19:58.656
that we never really resolved. The deer in the 
Everest Plateau area, or at least that area, there

19:59.597 --> 20:10.410
were certain red granite gravel areas that when 
the deer would would have sexual transformation.

20:13.822 --> 20:20.990
I mean, they would lose their maleness and their 
antlers would never harden. And I think we sort of

20:21.010 --> 20:24.455
looked at that for years. And

20:25.516 --> 20:34.667
we had the usual things that happened. You'd get a 
tiger here and occasionally even an elephant.

20:40.214 --> 20:41.275
Where would they come from? Well, usually from 
zoos or traveling zoos. Oh, okay. Either that or we

20:45.574 --> 21:04.292
would get them here, but they are the referrals 
with tigers and

20:45.574 --> 21:04.292
occasionally we would get

20:45.574 --> 21:04.292
exotic parrots and things like that. Do you 
remember any famous person's animal or animals?

21:12.963 --> 21:14.445
that y'all had to help with?

21:17.949 --> 21:18.290
I don't. We've got to stay clear of the people. So 
you didn't, no governors, no Mr. Rutter's dog, you

21:23.577 --> 21:35.192
didn't help with Ranger or anything like that? 
Most of those went after the clinic. That's what I

21:36.994 --> 21:37.735
thought. Anything

21:38.136 --> 21:42.261
we did, We gave the report to the clinic and the 
clinic then represented what was stored. And as

21:49.139 --> 22:01.262
far as

21:49.139 --> 22:01.262
the clinician is responsible, we found this or 
that and this kind of thing. Do you remember any

22:02.491 --> 22:15.572
effort by anybody outside veterinary medicine to 
tell you all that you must or must not do any task?

22:16.473 --> 22:27.250
Did any board member, politician, rich person, 
outside university administrator ever tried to

22:16.473 --> 22:27.250
micromanage?

22:28.175 --> 22:39.610
No, I think we were isolated pretty much from that 
because they'd go to the clinic or something like

22:28.175 --> 22:39.610
that and they, there were certain things that 
happened there that I would not want to name. It

22:39.630 --> 22:43.656
couldn't really be a legitimate answer. We were 
forced to, we had to, of course faculty members

22:45.679 --> 22:55.752
that would make mistakes, they'd like to us as 
pathologists to handle that for them, but that was

22:45.679 --> 22:55.752
another story. During your years on the faculty, 
were you on the admissions committee ever? In the

23:02.940 --> 23:05.544
early years, yes. In the early years. Describe 
what that was like. It was not, until those years,

23:09.509 --> 23:18.741
it was not a real problem except that where can we 
get enough people to fill this that are really

23:09.509 --> 23:18.741
unqualified. There was a period in there that when 
we expanded over that that was the case. Was that

23:24.470 --> 23:27.894
when first went from 64 to 128? I think that was the 
general basic time, and they, there were a lot of

23:27.994 --> 23:36.684
students, you know, they just barely could stay in 
A&M. They were applying, and the question I...

23:44.713 --> 23:53.683
Compare the quality of the students in your later 
year, your last years, with the quality of the

23:44.713 --> 23:53.683
students in your first years on the faculty.

23:56.228 --> 24:01.274
The students in the later years were academically 
much more sophisticated. And I remember some of

24:02.375 --> 24:11.104
those students, the low score of their GPR might 
have been a 3.4 or something like that. Where in the

24:11.785 --> 24:24.379
early years, particularly in the classes which I 
went through, that if you passed, you were in.

24:25.253 --> 24:35.245
And back in those years, again, because of the way 
the dynamics of the situation were, some students

24:25.253 --> 24:35.245
took six, seven years to get through. They just 
retook courses until they passed, because there

24:35.726 --> 24:44.317
was no such thing as there's so many slots. And in 
the later years, of course, if you missed out, then

24:44.337 --> 24:55.210
you were out and you had to reapply to get back in if 
you missed or failed a course. As coeducation

24:56.067 --> 25:06.480
began to be discussed here in the 60s, what did you 
and your colleagues in veterinary medicine think

24:56.067 --> 25:06.480
about the idea of coeducation? Well, I don't think 
there was any opposition to it. They thought it was

25:09.885 --> 25:17.835
rather incredulous that some young lay would want 
to do some of the things that veterinarians do. But

25:19.176 --> 25:25.264
that's the maleness of the mind, I think, and we've 
been educated. At

25:26.071 --> 25:34.861
that time, in the early 60s, were there many women 
nationally in veterinary medicine?

25:37.804 --> 25:38.845
I don't remember a lot. I think we went through the 
similar situation in most of them, although a lot

25:38.885 --> 25:45.253
of them did not have the restrictions that we had.

25:48.076 --> 25:55.504
In pathology, a lot of them, the women, for 
example, went into pathology because it was did

25:56.513 --> 26:02.420
not have the, it was a laboratory science, you 
might say. And it was easier for them to, just

26:02.440 --> 26:06.065
women, to become involved in. And they were some 
very, very competent individuals that did that.

26:12.212 --> 26:22.605
And today, what's happening in veterinary 
pathology is just like it is in many, many new women

26:12.212 --> 26:22.605
in veterinary pathology. Do you remember any

26:23.378 --> 26:36.473
important experiences in the department, either 
serious or humorous, as women became members of

26:23.378 --> 26:36.473
the student body?

26:41.198 --> 26:45.203
Not that I want to repeat. The selection committee 
has some interesting stories.

26:51.931 --> 26:55.075
the whales or the applicants. Were there some 
anecdotes and stories that faculty members used

26:55.475 --> 27:04.346
to tell that needed some censoring after 
coeducation began? There

27:04.406 --> 27:15.079
were some people that were rather, I guess they 
were sensitive. But I don't know that there was a

27:16.080 --> 27:17.702
bunch of them. I think most of the people at that age 
that had been in medicine were pretty civilized,

27:18.323 --> 27:28.214
I'll say, or timid, either one way. Do you 
remember, as department head, having to deal with

27:29.115 --> 27:41.469
any problem that was gender related with a 
student?

27:41.489 --> 27:43.912
Not particularly, no. Not in your department? No. 
That's what I was meaning. We had a rather smooth

27:48.884 --> 27:52.611
sailing I think. Our department was rather stern 
and felt that it

27:54.334 --> 28:07.517
had a serious charge to do. If you could perceive 
Ken Pierce as you would expect him to relate to

28:08.098 --> 28:13.828
students. I don't think the department is set that 
way.

28:19.729 --> 28:30.730
For me as dean of faculties, the major problems 
that bounced to me relating to the entire program

28:19.729 --> 28:30.730
of veterinary medicine were the admissions. That 
here was a good student who didn't get in because

28:30.970 --> 28:37.082
here were that many more that were better. And the 
one I particularly remember, I was in Dr.

28:37.940 --> 28:48.170
Williams' office when he got a long-distance call 
from Oscar Wyatt, who literally was cussing him

28:37.940 --> 28:48.170
out. I could hear he was yelling at him, and Dr. 
Williams at first was mad, and then he started

28:48.350 --> 28:56.138
laughing and held the phone out where I could hear 
it. And Wyatt said, U.S.O.B., I'm going to get you

28:56.479 --> 28:59.782
fired. And apparently he had promised his 
secretary that he could get her nephew or

28:59.942 --> 29:07.710
something or other, and his record was pitiful. 
Well, when Dr. Williams hung up the phone, he

29:08.787 --> 29:17.018
turned to me and seriously said, let me ask, you 
know, let me throw an idea at you. He said, what if I

29:17.598 --> 29:28.793
were to tell Veterinary Medicine to give 10 slots 
to be identified as presidential admissions?

29:29.133 --> 29:30.475
What do you think? I said, Dr. Williams, as soon as 
that word spreads, you will need 10 times 10 times

29:30.455 --> 29:37.035
10. There won't be enough slots if they're going to 
be done on that basis.

29:44.663 --> 30:07.954
then and then he said yeah he said i didn't think it 
was work and i told him that i had never heard of that

29:44.663 --> 30:07.954
anywhere else uh like that and i said and i said why 
don't you to i know mr white won't be satisfied but

29:44.663 --> 30:07.954
to rational people tell them you know here's the 
search committee i don't pick them there's a group

29:44.663 --> 30:07.954
that does that they're serious They may make a 
mistake, but if so, it's an honest mistake. But I,

30:12.165 --> 30:14.667
as the president, am not going to reach down. Well, 
that's what he tried to do. Yeah, yeah, because

30:17.710 --> 30:22.774
it's not going to work. Well, let's see. All your 
years in veterinary medicine, of what are you most

30:23.975 --> 30:28.720
proud?

30:36.006 --> 30:37.047
I'm proud of our students. And I'm particularly 
proud of our graduate program and the students and

30:37.516 --> 30:45.107
how they responded to it. I think that we did a 
creditable job with the thing we have in advancing

30:47.189 --> 30:55.621
veterinary pathology. And I think we represented 
the state quite well.

31:06.536 --> 31:07.017
What else?

31:13.696 --> 31:20.031
Well, I'm proud of the university for what it's 
done and the state for what it's done to tend back at

31:13.696 --> 31:20.031
it. And I think that sometimes it's a little bit 
embarrassing how they have protected this

31:20.052 --> 31:28.853
institution.
