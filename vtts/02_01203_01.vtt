WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:08.156
I mentioned that before, because I over-commit 
myself always. And they were not over-committing

00:08.657 --> 00:11.861
themselves at all. So I pushed them. I pushed Susan 
to get books in earlier than was comfortable, to

00:12.983 --> 00:20.813
push the printers and push the binders. And I 
pushed Noel to get more manuscripts in, not to

00:20.993 --> 00:29.464
reject them because we don't have time to review 
them. And I pushed them on their dates and said,

00:29.444 --> 00:33.630
we've got to have things done earlier. And so we 
just pushed and pushed and worked on increasing

00:33.770 --> 00:39.038
acquisitions. And we took risks. I pushed them to 
take risks with their selections and with the

00:41.021 --> 00:47.611
quantities. We did that quest for the presidency. 
And GALA wanted to publish 15,000, and I pushed

00:53.153 --> 00:59.820
them to publish 25,000, which they did. And 
somewhere in between is what we ended up selling.

01:02.602 --> 01:05.926
We went over 15,000, but we didn't get up to 25,000. 
But I wanted them to feel the commitment and the

01:06.386 --> 01:13.673
excitement and the push. I think that's going to go 
well. It's been an old concept of the series and the

01:14.854 --> 01:18.738
idea. I think Marilyn has basically directions 
That's

01:23.123 --> 01:26.937
exciting. That was another new thing that we got 
into was that whole George Bush connection.

01:35.999 --> 01:43.368
I won't take credit for having started that 
connection, but I do think that I really pushed

01:35.999 --> 01:43.368
them to strengthen that connection. Yeah, it's so 
obvious. I think there's so many areas in New

01:44.610 --> 01:49.777
Orleans that have failed to really count, 
including this bridge. I don't think we don't have

01:49.877 --> 01:51.819
a thing. Oh, I don't think so. And that quest for the 
presidency, that had to be done in impossible time

01:53.401 --> 02:01.011
constraints. We had to do from start to finish in 
six months on that book. And everybody said it

02:07.378 --> 02:09.600
can't be done. It can be done, but it can be done. But 
it was done. I've seen it done. Not here,

02:12.944 --> 02:13.765
necessarily. I said the commercial publishers 
can do it, but I can't read it. And I think if Rick

02:17.468 --> 02:20.351
Stetter had been there, they would have let it go. 
They wanted to do it. They were excited about it.

02:23.695 --> 02:25.757
And it was one of the most fun things that we did. 
That was when we got to, several of us got to go to

02:30.202 --> 02:31.865
What's her name? Catherine Graham's home in 
Washington, D.C., and we had the coming out party,

02:31.885 --> 02:41.223
and George Stephanopoulos was there, and Cokie 
Roberts was there, and it was wonderful. It was

02:41.623 --> 02:43.507
really glamorous. That story is the only 
excitement. Oh, I know. That's great. That's

02:46.572 --> 02:47.093
good. And it can be known. That's good. Okay, we 
worked on minimizing conservatism, and then the

02:52.240 --> 03:11.109
important thing is I tried to, in the team 
building, to emphasize that internal customer,

02:52.240 --> 03:11.109
and I mentioned that to you also, that our 
customers first are one another, because if I'm

02:52.240 --> 03:11.109
not serving your needs, you're not going to get 
your job done. And so we all recognized that we were

03:11.270 --> 03:19.142
serving someone else's needs inside the press, 
and then finally we had an external customer.

03:22.632 --> 03:43.847
okay so that's what i did that's what i tried to do 
and i think that's what we succeeded at doing that

03:22.632 --> 03:43.847
sounds really good now at some point uh we're going 
to search for a new director at what point and why

03:22.632 --> 03:43.847
and when did you signal that how did that happen um 
well i think um The original intention was that I

03:45.481 --> 03:55.831
was going to go in and kind of bring them together as 
a group and clean up their finances, too, because

03:45.481 --> 03:55.831
they had serious financial problems. I didn't 
even mention that, but we worked on that

03:55.851 --> 04:03.938
constantly, trying to figure out the finances and 
get them into reasonable financial shape. There

04:03.958 --> 04:06.020
was an audit going on at the time. Were they doing 
that? There were two things going on. First of all,

04:10.904 --> 04:14.728
prior to my getting there, When I was working with 
Rick, we also did an operational review. We took

04:19.753 --> 04:38.355
this group that reported to me, and I've neglected 
to mention that because that was a big part of it

04:19.753 --> 04:38.355
also, this operations analysis that reported to 
me at the time that I was meeting with Rick, and they

04:19.753 --> 04:38.355
did an operational review during which they 
discovered all the turmoil in the organization.

04:38.375 --> 04:43.281
At the same time, internal audit went in and did an 
audit, and they discovered that nobody knew

04:43.565 --> 04:48.043
anything about what was going on with the 
bookkeeping and the finances and all of that. It

04:48.063 --> 04:53.203
wasn't being handled properly, and there were 
some serious issues uh checks and balance

04:53.555 --> 05:18.533
problems and things like that so we continue to 
have internal audit come in and help to fix all

04:53.555 --> 05:18.533
those we brought in people from the fiscal office 
to help us to figure out a better accounting system

04:53.555 --> 05:18.533
that is not my strength and that's not the strength 
of anyone in the press it is tom's now yes

05:19.458 --> 05:30.791
So I wasn't real successful in getting the proper 
accounting system in, but I was successful in

05:19.458 --> 05:30.791
getting some accountability and in getting us to 
open up the books. Because no one but Diana Hine

05:30.891 --> 05:34.195
knew what existed. So we started discussing the 
finances in these weekly staff meetings, and

05:34.775 --> 05:44.286
everybody got a much better understanding of what 
we really had and didn't have. Because she had them

05:44.306 --> 05:46.208
convinced that they were really in the red. And of 
course we had these enormous balances in all these

05:50.407 --> 05:53.630
accounts that we weren't doing anything with. And 
some of that still exists. I talked to her the other

05:54.972 --> 05:57.054
day. Just an aside, I picked up that there was 
accounts that are really being unused. Oh, there

06:02.200 --> 06:02.981
are. And so what we try to do is... I'm sure Tom will 
send them those in due time. Well, and what I

06:06.645 --> 06:12.891
encourage Tom to do is to focus on getting some of 
that money out of there. And some of that might be by

06:12.911 --> 06:18.237
opening up the parameters of those accounts like 
we did with the... He talked about money a little

06:18.470 --> 06:29.925
bit, incidentally, and his view that the press is 
doing very well financially, as compared to other

06:18.470 --> 06:29.925
presses, quite secure, and that he plans to tell 
the world about it. I said, I think that's good,

06:29.945 --> 06:41.621
Tom, because I think if people understand that 
you've been financially accountable, et cetera,

06:29.945 --> 06:41.621
et cetera, then you should get more respect and 
more support from the administration. He said,

06:41.641 --> 06:46.708
well, a lot of people around here think that if you 
tell people how much money you have, they'll try to

06:41.641 --> 06:46.708
take it away from you. That's true. Or what they'll 
do is take away any kind of assistance that they're

06:47.208 --> 06:51.653
given. That's right, yeah. And so that still 
exists within the press. I heard that mentioned

06:55.417 --> 07:01.583
several times, that they're going to lose their 
operations money because they're doing too well

06:55.417 --> 07:01.583
or something like that. And Trump says, no, I'm not 
going to deal with it that way. You're doing well,

07:05.787 --> 07:09.892
and I want the world to know I don't. So that's 
interesting. I knew all the auditing was going on

07:11.734 --> 07:14.076
in the United States. In fact, one of the ways that 
we lured Tom here, and lure is the right word, and

07:14.208 --> 07:20.456
I'll get into it. Well, I was going to say one of the 
ways that we lured him here is that I kept insisting

07:20.616 --> 07:43.945
to him that we were financially sound and that the 
university was financially supportive of the

07:20.616 --> 07:43.945
press and that we had almost a guarantee that they 
would not financially neglect the press. Yeah.

07:45.692 --> 07:47.820
And see, that was certainly one of the worries. And 
I'm sure had he walked into the staff, that fear

07:47.840 --> 07:53.178
would have been communicated very strongly. So he 
needed that. Right. That's right. Well, he

07:56.554 --> 07:57.956
wouldn't have come without it. He would not come. 
Because we really had to thank him to come. I mean,

08:02.241 --> 08:07.347
we just bent over backwards, and he said no twice, 
and we kept going back at him. Okay, how did you find

08:07.368 --> 08:08.429
him? What was the process? Okay, this is sort of, 
everything about this is just the personal touch,

08:10.451 --> 08:16.699
and it's interesting. I said, I was sent in to build 
a team and try to pull the finances together and put

08:17.472 --> 08:23.139
together a strategic plan. And we knew that we 
weren't going to start a search until that was

08:23.179 --> 08:26.864
done. So when we were about maybe almost a year into 
my being there, we said, now it's time to start a

08:27.545 --> 08:34.193
search. And Bowen was here at the time. And Jerry 
was my boss. And they both said to me, would you like

08:43.866 --> 08:47.310
that job? And I said, I would love that job. I love 
the press, but I'm not what the press needs. I said,

08:56.326 --> 08:59.053
the press needs someone who knows publishing. 
I've done what I can do for it. Now they need someone

09:03.727 --> 09:06.390
who can take them to the next level. Because I said, 
I think that they have maximized what they can do at

09:06.450 --> 09:17.203
the level where they are, and now they need to get 
into some new, really exciting publishing. And I

09:17.543 --> 09:18.945
can't do that for them. Because they said, if you 
would like the job, you've done such a good job,

09:19.706 --> 09:24.912
everybody there loves you, you may stay. And I 
thought, well, this is the most fun job I have ever

09:25.733 --> 09:29.838
had in my life. That's a tough decision for you. 
Well, it was... It was, it was and it wasn't. It

09:36.485 --> 09:39.329
wasn't because I knew that they needed better than 
me. Number one, even though they really did, all of

09:39.990 --> 09:44.177
them came in and begged me to stay. But number two, I 
like being involved in a million different things

09:44.377 --> 09:50.666
in the university, and I didn't want to let go of 
that. I knew if I'd stayed at the press, then I'd be

09:50.726 --> 09:53.871
out of everything else. I like that. Which is part 
of their glory. Oh, that's right. They like it that

09:58.118 --> 09:58.959
way. They like it that way, that's right. But I 
would have missed... the thread of the

10:01.608 --> 10:03.272
university. Because I like all this stuff. So 
anyway, we advertised in a lot of different

10:06.198 --> 10:11.269
places. And we got in lots of different 
applications. But we had a search committee. and

10:17.200 --> 10:37.217
it was chaired by Fred Heath, and we had wonderful 
people on this search committee, and everyone

10:17.200 --> 10:37.217
kept saying, and what we did was we got 
nominations, and was, I can't remember who it was,

10:17.200 --> 10:37.217
who said that Tom Rotell's name had been 
suggested. And so someone had asked him to submit

10:37.957 --> 10:41.561
an application, which he did. And I don't think he 
was serious about it, but he sent it in. And we all

10:44.845 --> 10:53.034
discussed things like, well, he's the second 
highest or the highest paid director in the

10:44.845 --> 10:53.034
country. Can we afford him? He does a wonderful job 
there, but why would he move?

11:00.923 --> 11:09.172
He might even be thinking about retirement 
because he's, you know, so he may not be interested

11:00.923 --> 11:09.172
in taking on a new challenge like this. So anyway, 
we narrowed the list, and we kept coming back to Tom

11:10.774 --> 11:26.931
Rotell, and I don't know that anybody was 
seriously considering him at the beginning, but

11:10.774 --> 11:26.931
whoever was his champion on the search committee 
kept bringing his name, and of course, there was no

11:10.774 --> 11:26.931
reason to reject him because he was wonderful, but 
We didn't know that he would even be as serious. And

11:31.829 --> 11:37.315
so when we narrowed the list, he was on it. And he 
might even have been the last person that we

11:37.335 --> 11:41.519
brought in. But if not, he was the second to last. 
And we brought some down. And they were good. But

11:47.965 --> 11:49.787
everybody was hot and cold. Some people really 
liked this one. Others didn't like them at all. Tom

11:54.812 --> 11:56.293
came in. Everyone loved him. Everyone. 
Incidentally, he said he got an email from you.

12:03.404 --> 12:05.027
Yes, he did. And he said, I think part of his 
response was, if anybody is that enthusiastic

12:05.207 --> 12:13.000
about a school or a class, I need to go see. Because 
he said, I really wasn't thinking. I really needed

12:14.903 --> 12:15.804
to do that. Well, that's what I was going to say. We 
were on this network. And I forget what it was

12:19.751 --> 12:23.597
called, but this publishing network. Oh, that 
drove me crazy, also, on the job, because it seemed

12:24.117 --> 12:36.598
to me like publishers had nothing more to do than to 
sit and write these very long treatises over the

12:24.117 --> 12:36.598
Internet. Because these things would be just, you 
know, take you 20 minutes to read them, and you'd

12:36.618 --> 12:43.490
get 20, 30 of them a day. Oh, that's one good thing 
about writing this history. Wardlaw and Lyman

12:45.794 --> 12:47.998
loved to write letters. That's all they did. Well, 
that's all these publishers did. That's what they

12:51.082 --> 12:51.743
did. They didn't have email. Well, because of 
that, I had Tom Rotell's address. And so I did write

12:56.328 --> 13:00.333
him a very long email. And actually, I didn't write 
it to him. I wrote it to everybody out there. I put it

13:04.038 --> 13:05.039
on the internet. Oh, OK. And I said, I really 
encourage all of you. This is a wonderful press. We

13:11.587 --> 13:13.109
have very talented people. The university is very 
supportive of it. Because at the time, they were

13:15.535 --> 13:20.327
all talking, they were all agonizing over 
internet. It was funny to read. They were

13:22.111 --> 13:31.755
agonizing over their dwindling resources and the 
fact that the universities were pulling away

13:22.111 --> 13:31.755
their support, and they were in these dumpy little 
environments. They didn't know what they were

13:31.972 --> 13:33.394
going to do. And with electronic publishing, oh, 
moaning and groaning. And I was writing and

13:38.342 --> 13:43.049
saying, I encourage you to apply here. We are in a 
beautiful building. The university gives us

13:45.592 --> 13:49.278
financial support. They've committed to it. It's 
wonderfully talented people. We've got nowhere

13:52.443 --> 13:54.005
to go but up. It's exciting. And so that's what, 
yes, and that is what made Tom Rotel. And then Tom

13:59.551 --> 14:01.934
and I communicated a couple of times. Well, then we 
offered him the job after a very lengthy

14:01.994 --> 14:07.159
interviewing process. We offered him the job, and 
he turned it down. Oh, I didn't know that. Oh, yes,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.246
he turned it down. So we went back at it again, and I 
got on the phone with him, and we tried to a couple of

14:13.266 --> 14:21.334
times, and Bill Perry got on the phone with him. We 
brought him back again. We offered him the job

14:22.915 --> 14:24.002
again. And I believe he turned it down again. Or if 
he didn't turn it down, he just, yes, he was very

14:28.739 --> 14:32.906
cool. Until we finally put together a package. We 
gave him a salary that was way more than we thought

14:35.610 --> 14:43.904
the press could afford, and certainly way more 
than they'd have paid me if I had taken the job. If I

14:43.964 --> 14:48.432
had known I could make that much money, I'd have had 
to say yes. We gave way more than we ever dreamed of

14:49.594 --> 14:53.380
paying. Journalism kicked in some money. Bill 
Perry, the library kicked in some money. So we put

14:58.806 --> 15:03.851
together a wonderful package for him and we said he 
better be good. And he took the job and everyone in

15:03.891 --> 15:10.137
the press was unanimous. He was their first 
choice. There was not a single person who had put

15:12.179 --> 15:16.824
someone else ahead of him. That's good. That's a 
good one. So that's how we ended up where we did. And

15:20.528 --> 15:21.949
when I left, I left without looking back, because I 
said it was a wonderful experience, but they've

15:22.537 --> 15:31.189
got the right person there now to do what needs to be 
done. I think so. I think he still remains to prove

15:31.810 --> 15:36.196
himself in a way, but it's going to be really 
interesting. He fancies himself, and probably

15:36.256 --> 15:38.279
is. They manage him. And he says, I'm really more of 
a, you can call him a micromanager, since he's

15:39.501 --> 15:46.210
trying to tell everybody what to do. He's 
hands-on. To refine and... And I think that's

15:52.658 --> 16:13.603
exactly what they needed, because I didn't know 
how to tell Susan how to do better the publishing

15:52.658 --> 16:13.603
part of it, and I didn't know how to work with Mary 
Lynn and doing the editing, and I certainly didn't

15:52.658 --> 16:13.603
know how to work with authors and doing the 
acquisitions, and so he has the talent To develop

16:13.583 --> 16:15.908
those people. He has the knowledge and the skill to 
develop the talent, further develop their

16:15.928 --> 16:20.939
talents. I didn't have that. All I could do was to 
give them the motivation to work on developing

16:21.861 --> 16:29.618
their own talent. But I couldn't give them the 
technical. Well, there's such a strong base in the

16:32.142 --> 16:34.765
street area. The vigil is enormous. It really is. 
It is. And it's still exciting. That's what I say. I

16:41.094 --> 16:44.379
just hope that they're still having as much fun as 
they were having when I was there. Well, that's

16:44.399 --> 16:44.960
hard to do. And you know, someone... Scholarly and 
a commercial press. And so, because before I got

16:50.267 --> 16:55.895
there, I really didn't even understand what the 
purpose of this press was. Well, I was going to ask

16:56.115 --> 16:58.018
you about that. Did you have a, from the 
administrative perspective, what was their

16:58.589 --> 17:17.519
view, and I think that view had changed indeed with 
the then current administration from what it had

16:58.589 --> 17:17.519
been with Vandiver

16:58.589 --> 17:17.519
and with Jack Williams, you know, the regular 
patrons in the press. And the new administration

17:17.539 --> 17:19.602
really was not. And

17:19.936 --> 17:28.907
Bowen, I think, is probably the press would never 
be one of his favorite things. No. No, that's

17:29.288 --> 17:29.989
right. So that world has changed, and the press, 
for example, does now report to the provost

17:30.009 --> 17:35.616
instead of to the president. And that was my idea, 
as a matter of fact, because when you report to the

17:35.636 --> 17:41.083
president, Especially if it's a president that's 
not one of your supporters, you get nothing. You

17:46.659 --> 17:48.562
get no attention, you get nothing. Whereas 
reporting to the provost kind of ensured that

17:48.662 --> 17:57.774
ongoing financial support, and it ensured that 
scholarly approach. They were very, very

17:58.455 --> 18:02.200
apprehensive about that change. And I kept saying 
to them, relax, you'll like it better. But they

18:05.044 --> 18:06.946
felt like they were being demoted. Yes. And it was 
my suggestion. It was part of our operational

18:09.866 --> 18:24.727
review that suggested that they be taken from the 
president and given to the provost, where they

18:09.866 --> 18:24.727
could get some visibility and some attention and 
not just, you know, Rick would go to the

18:09.866 --> 18:24.727
president's staff meetings and his claim to fame 
was that he poured the coffee there. And I'm very

18:24.808 --> 18:25.709
serious. Everybody said, Rick Stetter does the 
coffee. And he would tell you himself, my only role

18:28.453 --> 18:35.563
in that staff meeting

18:28.453 --> 18:35.563
is to pour the coffee. But now, I'm hoping that

18:37.763 --> 18:47.755
Tom has built a strong relationship with Fred 
Heath at the library, and with Bill Perry, and with

18:37.763 --> 18:47.755
the dean. I mean, that's where he belonged. Yeah, I 
think you're probably right. I think one of the

18:51.420 --> 19:07.399
problems, as I said, and I think this came up in the 
conversation with several people, in fact, is

18:51.420 --> 19:07.399
still that the scholarly community, the Texas A&M 
academics, don't still have much sense of what the

18:51.420 --> 19:07.399
press is, and what it does for them or to them or 
anything else. It's amazing, but it's still

19:11.307 --> 19:13.211
isolated. I read something just yesterday on the 
Aggie Hotline. I was going to ship it over to Mary

19:15.555 --> 19:19.041
Lynn and say, what's going on here? And then I 
didn't. But it was where one of our history

19:20.744 --> 19:30.602
professors has recently, is just now publishing a 
book that he got some kind of a, fancy grant to do on

19:31.510 --> 19:41.700
Tejanos and something else down at the border, and 
it's being published by University of New Mexico

19:31.510 --> 19:41.700
Press, and I was going to say, what's going on here? 
We've got our Borderlands series that would have

19:41.720 --> 19:48.447
fit in perfectly. No, it wasn't Bob. Oh, I know who 
it is. It's Armando Alonso. Yes, that's exactly

19:54.413 --> 19:56.155
right. I think that's what it was. I don't know why 
he went there. Well, New Mexico's a wonderful

19:59.692 --> 20:01.594
place. Yeah, sure. But, you know. Why in the world 
wasn't Tom over in the history department talking

20:05.799 --> 20:09.904
about that? Or someone. Mary Lynn, she's the 
borderlands person. Good point. Yeah, they

20:15.371 --> 20:17.434
really need to work on that. And I don't quite know 
what the solution is. One of the perceptions that

20:19.076 --> 20:25.243
indeed, maybe most press editors have, directors 
have, is that the The faculty are never

20:25.595 --> 20:27.758
supportive. I've seen that in the writing of your 
operations, which is one of the reasons Wardlaw is

20:27.778 --> 20:42.675
so terribly interested in trying to fix his 
association to other levels, to the former

20:27.778 --> 20:42.675
students, for one thing, and to the 
administration. But the administration and

20:42.695 --> 20:46.520
former students are not interested. Some of them 
are interested in scholarly press, but most of

20:46.880 --> 20:51.045
them would rather see the glitzy commercial kinds 
of publications. Sure, that's right. I know I

20:54.917 --> 20:58.182
asked John Lindezzer, why in the world are you so 
supportive of the French? I said, do you like

20:58.202 --> 20:59.625
books? He said, no, I don't like books. He said, I 
like A&M. And what does he support? He supports the

21:05.734 --> 21:07.757
artsy kinds of things. Yeah, oh, sure. He doesn't 
support the scholarly stuff. No, no. And so does

21:11.543 --> 21:14.547
Joe Moore. Right, right. And that's okay. I'm not 
knocking that. I mean, I like that, too. And, you

21:19.850 --> 21:23.595
know, I'm not interested in reading those 
scholarly books. But when I got there, I

21:23.615 --> 21:31.446
recognized, because before that, if you had 
talked to me about the press, I'd have said, oh,

21:23.615 --> 21:31.446
that old boring stuff. No wonder they don't make 
any money. They don't print anything that's

21:32.667 --> 21:34.390
interesting. When I got there, I realized I'd 
learned the value of the scholarly press. And now

21:41.640 --> 21:44.083
my impression is that is that this needs to be a 
scholarly press. And it can be a premier scholarly

21:48.722 --> 21:52.527
press. And I'm disappointed if Tom is not doing his 
job in this community with promoting the

21:52.607 --> 21:59.136
scholarly aspect. Because that's what I thought 
he could do that I can't. I think he is aware of that.

22:03.442 --> 22:07.507
And I think he is working in that direction. And I 
think it's particularly concerning in relation

22:07.527 --> 22:13.395
with the scholarly community and building that 
relationship. He's very proud, for example. But

22:15.685 --> 22:19.871
he also is concerned about selling books, which 
you have to do. Well, and that's a balance that the

22:19.891 --> 22:23.016
whole press realizes. That's kind of a fun 
balance. It is, yeah. It makes it a real challenge.

22:26.801 --> 22:27.843
That's right. You have to maintain credibility 
and also accountability in a very literal

22:27.983 --> 22:33.852
financial sense. That was always a fun thing for us 
to discuss, too, as a press was, OK, this doesn't

22:33.872 --> 22:42.184
really fit into the scholarly mission, but on the 
other hand, It's borderline. Look at how much

22:44.316 --> 22:47.414
money we can make on this. And everybody 
acknowledged that they loved to do
