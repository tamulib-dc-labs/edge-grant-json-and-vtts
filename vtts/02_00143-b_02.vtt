00:02.292 --> 00:18.242
Well, one thing you and I have talked about, one of 
the things that Jack Williams did better than

00:02.292 --> 00:18.242
anyone I've ever known is to write one, two, or 
three sentence notes to people. And it just had the

00:18.262 --> 00:22.149
ability to make everyone feel good. This is 
written For me, it's not something that's spit out

00:24.466 --> 00:29.174
of a computer or anything like that. It's not 
something that someone else had drafted for me.

00:34.624 --> 00:43.740
And again, that's one of the things that I wish that 
I had and don't.

00:43.957 --> 00:46.940
Obviously, it didn't take him a long time to write. 
It may have taken a long time to think, because they

00:47.660 --> 00:53.206
were always so well stated. It just would have been 
hard to improve on either. He had good wit about

00:59.752 --> 01:05.677
him. Physically, he made a very attractive 
appearance. And he was obviously bright and very

01:09.681 --> 01:11.983
articulate. So it just had a lot going for him. One 
of the things I never understood, he was always

01:14.230 --> 01:27.589
there, there, there in Radisson to talk about his 
military service and his decorations and his

01:14.230 --> 01:27.589
having been wounded. Right. I never heard him say 
anything about any of that. It was as if he didn't

01:30.713 --> 01:37.202
want anybody to think that he was trying to compete 
with Earl Rudder. That's the only thing I can think

01:37.342 --> 01:39.064
of. Well, you know, the only thing I remember He was 
obviously proud to have been a Marine. We didn't

01:47.936 --> 01:53.441
hear about his record, but he was not reticent to 
tell you he'd been a Marine. As far as you can be as an

01:53.461 --> 02:09.178
objective observer, if there were any board 
members that disagreed or disliked, disagreed

01:53.461 --> 02:09.178
with or disliked something about Jack Williams, 
what were their

02:12.010 --> 02:32.184
I think there were probably some board members who 
would have been more comfortable with a president

02:12.010 --> 02:32.184
with an engineering, science, technology 
background

02:12.010 --> 02:32.184
than one from humanities.

02:32.204 --> 02:35.149
I think there were some who thought maybe he didn't 
give agriculture and engineering as much

02:35.534 --> 02:42.202
attention as perhaps they believe they deserve.

02:45.266 --> 03:02.267
I think that there were some board members who 
might have been happier if Jack Williams had been a

02:45.266 --> 03:02.267
little more prone to say what he knew they would 
like to hear rather than what he believed they

02:45.266 --> 03:02.267
needed to hear.

03:08.170 --> 03:18.606
So he was not always politic in some of his 
statements to the board and the public about the

03:08.170 --> 03:18.606
board. He might have been as skillful as he was. I 
can't believe he didn't recognize what he was

03:22.332 --> 03:27.079
doing. But I'm assuming that he believed a greater 
good call for him to do what he was doing. Because as

03:33.769 --> 03:36.253
I think back about those two men, I can't think of 
many openings, if any, that existed that each of

03:37.297 --> 03:48.093
them didn't use. We almost got to South Texas. But 
as I recall, it was only on the condition that

03:53.261 --> 04:03.557
never, never, never would any of those courses be 
taught anywhere else but in Houston, something

03:53.261 --> 04:03.557
like that. And Dr. Williams, as I recall, said, no, 
if we're going to have a law school, I want at least

04:04.398 --> 04:09.505
part of it to be here. Right. And I know that, I say I 
know, I believe that he did want to have a law school

04:10.647 --> 04:21.962
at Texas A&M. Let's see. Let's go back and talk 
about President's wives, Mrs. Rutter and Mrs.

04:23.524 --> 04:32.296
Williams. Well, Mrs. Rutter, you know, amazing in 
that I'm sure there must have been someone else,

04:34.553 --> 04:47.010
maybe several others, of whom I'm not aware, but 
Mrs. Rutter is still a living legend at Texas A&M

04:34.553 --> 04:47.010
today. And when you think how long her husband has 
been dead, and the reverence that she still held

04:48.412 --> 04:58.525
him today is remarkable. And I always thought of 
Ms. Rudder as being someone like Lady Bird

05:01.464 --> 05:05.289
Johnson. And I don't know Lady Bird Johnson, but I 
think that Ms. Rudder and Lady Bird Johnson at

05:09.634 --> 05:17.944
least appear to have been those who could smooth 
the ruffled feathers that might have been created

05:09.634 --> 05:17.944
by their spouses. And I've never heard anyone 
speak unkindly about the other. And I think they

05:25.933 --> 05:27.915
were great assets for their husbands. I think that 
Mrs. Rutter has seen much more prominent now than

05:28.385 --> 05:36.342
she did while he was president. Well, I felt she was 
then, too. I just thought that, to me, Mrs. Rutter

05:38.727 --> 05:43.677
is someone who men like and women like. There's no 
jealousy. She's not pretentious. She's very

05:53.335 --> 05:58.524
proud of her children and her children like all 
other children. They didn't grow up without some

05:58.544 --> 06:02.190
bumps in some of their roads. She didn't try to hide 
it. She was proud to have the children. So I think

06:09.803 --> 06:10.845
she was just

06:13.829 --> 06:18.796
a complete asset for Earl Rutherford and for Texas 
A&M. Mrs. Williams. Mrs. Williams, I didn't know

06:19.597 --> 06:23.342
her. And I think that says something about it. I 
think that she probably preferred it that way. She

06:30.912 --> 06:31.533
was not doing it in public. And her appearance

06:31.553 --> 06:42.267
in the school, she was much happier being less 
visible and obviously didn't operate it. feel any

06:43.192 --> 06:50.743
need to compete with the reputation that Mr. Weber 
had. But I also had the feeling that he was very

06:50.763 --> 06:56.291
strong.

06:56.511 --> 06:59.515
Alright, let's jump back then to Jarvis. It's now 
the summer of 1980 and you and I know now that Jarvis

06:59.535 --> 07:08.268
would be terminated by the board. Were you aware of 
any of that coming? I was not surprised. As I told

07:13.012 --> 07:31.792
you earlier, when Frank Hewitt was Dean of Liberal 
Arts and Education, I ranked him certainly as one

07:13.012 --> 07:31.792
of the top administrators, university 
administrators I'd ever known, and maybe the

07:13.012 --> 07:31.792
tops.

07:32.413 --> 07:37.819
I thought he, I viewed him very differently after 
he became Chancellor. Since I have a theory for

07:38.930 --> 07:53.726
everything, my theory about this is that I think 
there were board members who were committed to

07:38.930 --> 07:53.726
weakening the role of

07:38.930 --> 07:53.726
the president of Texas A&M. I think that they 
believed that that person had just had too much

07:53.746 --> 08:07.080
power and had used it and had not been as sensitive 
to the role of the board as they would like for that

07:53.746 --> 08:07.080
person to have been. And I have imagined that it was 
a possibility, not a likelihood, that they told

08:08.782 --> 08:27.566
Frank Hewitt

08:08.782 --> 08:27.566
that they wanted to develop a strong assistant 
officer, and the chancellor being a strong

08:08.782 --> 08:27.566
chancellor. If that happened, and

08:27.586 --> 08:37.219
everything that Frank Hewitt did made perfect 
sense, then clearly the authority of the

08:27.586 --> 08:37.219
president of Texas A&M diminished. Do you 
remember some particular differences,

08:39.562 --> 08:50.295
disagreements between Ebert and Jarvis? I think 
the main differences were over money. There was a

08:55.202 --> 09:07.577
lot of relatively flexible money available 
within the university, and I think Jarvis was

08:55.202 --> 09:07.577
predisposed toward making decisions. about the 
allocation

09:07.996 --> 09:26.036
of those

09:07.996 --> 09:26.036
funds within

09:07.996 --> 09:26.036
the President's office and with a couple of very 
close advisors. And since George's background

09:26.056 --> 09:33.444
was in agriculture, I think it was viewed at least 
that maybe agriculture was getting more than its

09:26.056 --> 09:33.444
fair share. And from some board members' point of 
view, it's my belief. that

09:35.789 --> 09:55.845
they believe engineering was not getting the 
attention they deserve.

09:55.865 --> 09:58.069
Are you aware of any particular disagreements 
you've had with any of the deans over our patients?

09:58.089 --> 09:58.329
No, I'm not. And with Mack? Mack was very closely 
involved with Jarvis in the allocation of funds.

10:05.256 --> 10:10.161
He and, as far as I'm aware, the two of them were 
fairly... And Howard Vestal. And Howard Vestal

10:10.441 --> 10:12.984
were, okay. Now, let's talk about some of those 
people. Describe Professor Vestal and what his

10:16.507 --> 10:20.291
task was and his talents. Howard was a retired Air 
Force officer.

10:29.738 --> 10:49.659
a nice man, jovial,

10:29.738 --> 10:49.659
and at the same time, he'd been a colonel, and would 
be treated like a colonel, and thought like a

10:29.738 --> 10:49.659
colonel, and acted like a colonel. With all those 
things, he was still a really nice person, so a nice

10:49.679 --> 10:54.124
combination of things. Howard always impressed 
me as someone that I would trust. But

10:59.489 --> 11:13.148
I'm convinced that there's got to be a school 
somewhere for our vice presidents for finance and

10:59.489 --> 11:13.148
our business. And the number one thing that they 
learn and the thing you have to prove that you've

11:13.168 --> 11:25.024
learned before you graduate is that you never tell 
anyone all there is to know about where the money

11:13.168 --> 11:25.024
is. So vice presidents of business seem to like to 
have, you know, some discretion about where the

11:25.342 --> 11:39.155
money is and be able to come up with some funds that 
will literally let a president do what the

11:25.342 --> 11:39.155
president really would like to do. That makes the 
vice president of business a very, very important

11:39.616 --> 11:45.661
person. But, you know, again, we had a series of 
events because Earl Rudder obviously developed a

11:45.682 --> 11:53.509
very image and often his land commissioner and his 
views had a lot of integrity. And then he brought

12:00.149 --> 12:09.763
Clark Diebel, who I understand was told, you know, 
I want you to let me do what I want to do, but I'm going

12:00.149 --> 12:09.763
to keep me out of Huntsville too. And I think Clark 
was again

12:09.783 --> 12:16.573
one of those that had a lot of integrity. And so I 
think we were blessed with a series of people in the

12:16.593 --> 12:22.382
financial office during that period of time. that 
helped A&M develop a very good reputation in

12:23.155 --> 12:32.829
Brazos County and in Austin. And I think Howard 
continued that. Who was the Chief Financial

12:36.474 --> 12:39.238
Officer? After Tom Cherry.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.966
During Williams'

12:44.722 --> 12:48.966
administration? Yeah, that's right. I think it 
probably changed with him and then with George. He

12:53.371 --> 12:56.294
was the number two man for a time. Right. Then the 
chief student officer during those years. Well,

13:02.461 --> 13:06.885
during those years, John Coates. John came from 
East Texas,

13:06.905 --> 13:13.412
now Texas A&M University at Congress. John was a 
really good selection. One of my better

13:17.472 --> 13:24.342
judgments, I was asked to apply for that job and 
chose not to. They chose the right person. John was

13:29.348 --> 13:31.391
a very good choice. I remember the part of the, one 
of the luncheons, one of the luncheons, I was there

13:31.411 --> 13:39.282
over on the Rudder Tower. And I was nicely 
impressed with Cole. That's when I thought, gee,

13:42.923 --> 13:48.611
surely we can do better than somebody from Texas. 
What made him such a good student officer? I think

13:53.999 --> 13:59.547
the fact that he's so outgoing with students and 
everyone else. He was certainly not anywhere

14:01.369 --> 14:06.957
close to being typical at A&M. I'm always kind of 
surprised that John has said, ever since I've

14:09.772 --> 14:18.301
known him, he's a kisser and a hugger to me. And so he 
was a lot more hands-on in a socially acceptable

14:18.321 --> 14:27.510
way with a lot of people. And again, I think John was 
creative

14:27.530 --> 14:36.960
in a lot of the programs he brought to student 
services.

14:41.935 --> 14:52.128
So to me he made a, what I would guess would be a 
pretty big adjustment from a Commonwealth

14:41.935 --> 14:52.128
student to A&M. But I'm going to get into a student 
life program that I can

14:52.148 --> 15:00.137
be very proud of. Can you think of any special 
decisions or transitions that coupled this?

15:08.047 --> 15:09.529
Well, I'm not sure how it evolved, but we got away 
from the Dean of Men and Dean of Women approach, and

15:10.218 --> 15:18.726
I think that was probably the national trend. But 
we had a fairly tumultuous period for a short

15:18.746 --> 15:25.553
period of time. My brother, Toby Shriver, he 
changed the name, I think, three times in two

15:25.573 --> 15:29.457
years. We hired her under one name. She came here 
with another name, and then she took a third name,

15:32.019 --> 15:38.065
and she went back to Shriver.

15:38.905 --> 15:39.826
as needing women.

15:42.809 --> 15:50.878
I think John made the right decision on what to do 
about some personnel matters. I think there were

15:50.898 --> 15:56.965
some things that happened that might not have been 
John's first choice, but he handled them very

15:50.898 --> 15:56.965
well. There had been a disagreement among board 
members and some of the university

15:57.205 --> 16:04.373
administrators about additional on-campus 
housing. For a while, the decision appeared to be

16:06.817 --> 16:12.284
that we were not going to do it anymore. We'd let the 
community take care of that, and we realized the

16:12.424 --> 16:16.830
community wasn't taking care of that. So then we 
built several more dorms. So I think the student

16:19.413 --> 16:23.698
life program at A&M has done very well. Thanks to a 
lot of people, I think the student services

16:23.718 --> 16:31.127
through the MSC have been very good. And I said, 
John,

16:31.148 --> 16:36.334
you seem to be at the lead go with the flow, make sure 
they went in the right direction. All right, now

16:41.239 --> 16:45.865
I'm about to go off into areas that I know almost 
nothing about. I learned the night we arrived in El

16:45.885 --> 16:53.354
Paso to begin our new task out there that Jarvis had 
been terminated here. How did your assignment

16:54.416 --> 17:02.946
change after Jarvis was no longer president, or 
did it change? Not

17:03.719 --> 17:12.395
really. It was obvious that Frank Hubert

17:12.416 --> 17:21.372
had won in the eyes of the board. And that's when 
Chuck Sampson

17:21.393 --> 17:26.402
came in to serve as interim president.

17:29.369 --> 17:37.221
Chuck's style was very different from Jarvis's.

17:37.241 --> 17:38.963
How so? Well, as I said, Jarvis had more of what I 
think was the ag-slash-political approach. He

17:45.272 --> 17:56.028
was very interested and concerned in the sense 
that things that were happening could be

17:45.272 --> 17:56.028
happening and might happen in Austin. Chuck, as a 
former department head in engineering, I think

17:59.795 --> 18:08.725
had the engineering approach and he was much more 
methodical and much more analytical.

18:14.351 --> 18:26.465
I think Chuck

18:14.351 --> 18:26.465
probably wanted a lot more information than he was 
likely to get before he would make the decision.

18:26.485 --> 18:28.047
And constantly I think some of the decisions were 
not made. as quickly as they might have been. Did he

18:32.288 --> 18:33.650
bring any staff with him? Not that I

18:35.193 --> 18:41.643
can remember. He took often three briefcases and 
stuff with him home each night.

18:48.674 --> 18:55.244
I don't think you can find a better person than 
Chuck

18:48.674 --> 18:55.244
Simms. As far as y'all were aware here, Was he 
hoping he would be considered for the task

18:58.030 --> 19:03.419
permanently? I certainly had that feeling. That 
would have been my guess. And when did you all learn

19:09.730 --> 19:15.561
that he wasn't going to? I think there were a couple 
presentations to board members that he made that

19:16.342 --> 19:21.591
were As far as you know, who were the board members 
calling

19:23.630 --> 19:34.047
in? Who were the most

19:34.327 --> 19:44.203
impressionable, the most influential board 
members?

19:52.807 --> 20:09.817
I

19:52.807 --> 20:09.817
guess... I don't think Peter Bell was in honor, but 
he was certainly not more influential when he was

20:09.837 --> 20:13.524
honored. Ross Wiseman was always a dominant 
member of the board. I don't know if there was a

20:16.803 --> 20:19.526
board member calling the shots then. I don't know 
who it was. I don't know. Bumbright, I guess, would

20:21.609 --> 20:27.095
be number one. When I chat with... McKenzie. Bill 
McKenzie. I bet so. See, what I'm hoping to build up

20:30.739 --> 20:34.924
to is to know what questions to ask them. Okay, then 
when did y'all become aware that the president of

20:36.966 --> 20:44.815
North Texas State might be the new president here? 
Very late. Bunbright, as I remember, had made an

20:46.503 --> 20:57.177
announcement that we would have a new president 
named by a certain point in time. And the time was

20:57.197 --> 21:01.724
getting very close. And then I think most of us were 
surprised when Frank Bannon offered the job and

21:01.744 --> 21:10.415
had accepted

21:01.744 --> 21:10.415
it. And I think that there was some who believed 
that the announced date of the driving force in the

21:16.658 --> 21:19.662
selection process.

21:20.503 --> 21:28.752
When did Frank Menninger first, when did y'all 
first see him, meet with him? I guess right after he

21:28.772 --> 21:32.797
became the board. So there was no first 
presentation? Not that I know of. Describe his

21:40.626 --> 21:44.671
leadership style.

21:46.113 --> 21:46.513
Exciting. Frank

21:47.742 --> 21:55.956
is one of the most interesting people I've ever 
known in my life.

21:57.739 --> 22:03.829
He can be so presidential at times, it's just 
awe-inspiring. All of a sudden he's changing his

22:05.472 --> 22:11.202
mind quickly.

22:16.733 --> 22:32.826
I served as interim vice president for Aging 
Affairs for a period of time and I felt I needed to be

22:16.733 --> 22:32.826
very flexible because there would be some times 
that Frank might be expected to be somewhere else.

22:32.846 --> 22:37.476
His plans would change and so he had to have plan B 
ready all the time. But again, he's bright, and

22:38.873 --> 22:47.359
he's articulate, and he's very, very charming. 
Now the, he, did Mack, Mack remain? Yes. And

22:50.709 --> 22:51.752
retired? And

22:52.019 --> 23:03.538
so that Frank made no particular personnel 
changes in the leadership team? Not in the

23:03.558 --> 23:07.644
leadership team, except as I said, I became the 
vice president. He brought in Sharon Riley, who

23:07.664 --> 23:13.514
proved, I think, to do a very good job. And he 
brought Eddie Joe back from North Texas. to be the

23:19.120 --> 23:23.807
chief financial officer.

23:24.327 --> 23:30.956
Then Gordon Eaton, you were interim and then 
Gordon Eaton? Correct. Talk about Gordon and his

23:32.038 --> 23:35.983
style. Gordon Eaton was a very bright, charming,

23:36.845 --> 23:48.621
thoughtful,

23:36.845 --> 23:48.621
sensitive man. He was admired,

23:51.031 --> 24:08.116
I think, by almost all the faculty.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.120
Again, never trying to impress them with his 
background, but was impressive with his

24:09.198 --> 24:11.120
background. One of the easiest people to talk to 
that I've ever met. One of the things that that I

24:16.158 --> 24:19.882
liked about his statement. I never felt that he 
suggested there might be another way he might want

24:19.942 --> 24:32.297
to consider something before he made the 
decision. And as I said earlier, he had to be very

24:32.317 --> 24:34.860
careful because if he made the suggestion, he 
might not well do it. It didn't turn out what he

24:34.880 --> 24:37.423
felt.

24:40.086 --> 24:43.330
He's a very confident person in himself. can deal 
with anyone

24:44.677 --> 25:14.464
faculty legislators like experience with the u.s 
geological survey must have served

24:44.677 --> 25:14.464
him well i think one of the most thoughtful men i've 
ever met any key decisions during this one of the

25:15.457 --> 25:18.720
Gordon wasn't, you know, in that role very long. A

25:19.081 --> 25:25.227
couple years, three years maybe. And then, then do 
you go to Iowa State with him? With him. With him,

25:29.672 --> 25:30.373
that's right. And that's when? In, uh, 86? 86. 
Okay. Alright, now, so then let's look back. Uh,

25:41.164 --> 25:44.468
who were some special students that you may have 
worked with, advised, or known, that you now hold

25:44.988 --> 25:53.758
warmly in your heart?

25:54.299 --> 26:01.708
One person who got me on the course was Ken Capeley. 
Ken was one of those obvious student leaders when

26:01.728 --> 26:04.811
he was here. He was involved with the Liberal Arts 
Student Council.

26:10.975 --> 26:22.748
Two of the things that I felt good about the Liberal 
Arts Student Council, primarily, I guess, they

26:10.975 --> 26:22.748
helped me do what I'd like to get done, and that is 
convert from the three-point grading system to

26:10.975 --> 26:22.748
the four-point grading system. Because we were 
one of the very few institutions in the country in

26:22.768 --> 26:27.593
the three-point. And the Liberal Arts Student 
Council was the one that advanced the idea of going

26:27.613 --> 26:34.801
to the four-point system. And the other was the 
QDROP policy. And I remember You know, working

26:41.047 --> 26:50.418
with Kent, I was the advisor for the student 
council, and working with him to try to get the

26:41.047 --> 26:50.418
QDROP accepted, and it was rejected. And then when 
Kent came back on the staff with Jack Williams, it

26:51.919 --> 26:57.386
went through verbatim. And I remember telling 
Kent, when he was a student, you know, I said, Kent,

26:58.267 --> 27:03.072
you don't win everything. I said, this is bad and 
nasty. I said, sometimes someone plows the soil,

27:06.074 --> 27:14.964
and someone plants a seed, and someone fertilizes 
it, and somebody waters it, and someone else may

27:06.074 --> 27:14.964
gather the fruit. But when it did pass, I pulled it 
out and gave it to Kent to remind him that he had been

27:15.965 --> 27:24.675
a major player in preparing the ground. Roger 
Miller, who was a journalism major, who I thought

27:24.695 --> 27:32.704
was very talented, I had hoped would also run the 
politics. Chet Edwards was another one. They were

27:37.172 --> 27:38.614
all here at the same time.

27:41.597 --> 27:47.024
Those were probably the three that came along 
together that I thought a lot about. One that is

27:47.384 --> 27:57.116
different, but it's kind of interesting how 
people, you can influence someone. This one I

27:57.176 --> 27:58.778
didn't, but anyway. I have a grandson who played at 
Westlake this year, as you know. And so his father

28:04.375 --> 28:13.705
and mother hosted the Westlake football team for 
Thursday night meals for 13 weeks. And so it came up

28:15.327 --> 28:27.060
that Myna Brees, Myna Adkins when she was here,

28:15.327 --> 28:27.060
is the mother of Drew Brees who was the quarterback 
at Purdue. And so Gary and Myna were in school at the

28:31.190 --> 28:32.732
same time here. And so it came up in the 
conversation that I was Gary's father-in-law. So

28:38.719 --> 28:42.743
Gary made a point that we'd meet at one of the 
Westlake football games. And so she reminded me

28:42.763 --> 28:48.029
that I had given her an award as a liberal arts 
student. And she was one of the first Diamond

28:48.049 --> 28:52.194
Darlings. And her brother is Marty Akins. And her 
father was a high school coach for a long time. And

29:00.603 --> 29:14.199
so I was talking to her about Drew, you know, not 
coming to A&M, and it was obvious she was not very

29:00.603 --> 29:14.199
happy

29:00.603 --> 29:14.199
because Drew had been told he'd be invited for a 
visit to A&M and never had the invitation offered.

29:16.141 --> 29:23.430
And so, anyway, he's done fairly well at Purdue 
this year. Your proudest moments as you look back?

29:28.413 --> 29:44.295
I think the proudest moment was not a moment in 
time, but I would like to think that I was viewed as

29:28.413 --> 29:44.295
someone who helped get things done.

29:44.915 --> 29:54.268
I think degree-wise, program-wise, 
facility-wise,

29:44.915 --> 29:54.268
being the chairman of the master planning 
committee One of the things that I'm very proud of

29:55.649 --> 30:08.428
is that when I first got involved in the master 
planning committee, I had a list of all the

29:55.649 --> 30:08.428
buildings that were going to be torn down, and it 
was almost everything. And I'd like to think that I

30:08.568 --> 30:15.979
was one of them who said, you know, the diversity of 
that architecture on the campus is an asset. And so

30:15.999 --> 30:23.850
there are a lot of buildings still standing that 
were renovated and all that, and we're scheduled

30:15.999 --> 30:23.850
to be torn down. The Ag building over by the 
library,

30:24.792 --> 30:32.522
the pavilion was going to be torn down.

30:35.767 --> 30:40.333
Most of the old quad buildings were scheduled to be 
torn down. And I just thought that would have been

30:40.353 --> 30:45.079
tragic. And so anyway, you look around the campus 
and say, well, we had some influence on some of

30:45.099 --> 30:51.728
those things. So it's really, someone asked me, 
you know, what it's like to be a university

30:53.851 --> 31:01.463
administrator. And I tried to give an honest 
answer. And when I picked someone up, I said, well,

31:04.288 --> 31:09.075
the way you described it, why would anyone want to 
be one? And I said, well, I didn't really intend to

31:09.095 --> 31:11.219
do that.

31:14.704 --> 31:19.572
But I said, you know, to me, if you think you know 
what a good university is about, you're much more

31:20.463 --> 31:26.976
likely to influence the direction of the 
university as an administrator than you are as a

31:20.463 --> 31:26.976
faculty member. And that's the satisfaction. To 
believe that A&M or Iowa State are better

31:29.521 --> 31:37.577
institutions today and that you helped make them.
