WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:04.971
to do with selecting the new members. As you think 
back, was the group rather select in its quality?

00:11.262 --> 00:12.364
Yes, I think so. A lot of people looked on it that 
were not members as sort of a fraternity. And as you

00:21.158 --> 00:30.109
think back, was there any part of the, any unit of 
the Corps that had more than its share of RV

00:21.158 --> 00:30.109
members? I don't think so. There were some that 
really didn't have much. I don't remember that

00:34.775 --> 00:39.020
there were an awful lot of fellows from the 
infantry. I just, I don't remember that. In the

00:42.016 --> 00:52.069
Corps in your day, was there any part of the Corps 
that supposedly was the most distinguished, the

00:42.016 --> 00:52.069
best students, or the most admired? I think not. I 
think in each regiment, though, there might have

00:53.110 --> 00:57.777
been a troop, a battery, or a company. Where, for 
example, in Sea Battery Coast is where we call them

00:58.277 --> 01:04.966
the eggheads. They seem like to be the best 
students of the bunch. Was there anything at the

01:08.170 --> 01:10.874
bottom of the list that was supposed to be? No, I 
don't think so. And you were in the outfit you were

01:12.610 --> 01:18.696
in almost by accident? Sure. Okay. Let's see. Go 
back to the routine of the day. When you weren't in

01:24.381 --> 01:27.544
class during the day, where did you go? Well, if you 
were a freshman, you went back to the dormitory to

01:28.305 --> 01:33.090
be available to run details. Okay. Could you hide 
out in the library? No. You only could go to the

01:37.454 --> 01:39.816
library if you had permission. and you'd have to 
put it on your door if you were a freshman, at least

01:40.370 --> 01:44.294
in my outfit. I had permission from Mr. So-and-so 
to go to the library. Where could you get a

01:49.639 --> 01:53.403
Coca-Cola? Casey's in the basement of the YMCA was 
a drugstore sort of thing you could get if you had

01:53.483 --> 02:00.270
any money.

02:03.212 --> 02:05.194
There was nothing at the North Gate. Then describe 
dining. Well, they was based on the Army ration, so

02:09.142 --> 02:13.906
we were told in those days. I don't know of anybody 
that ever starved to death, but it was something

02:15.708 --> 02:21.393
less than the best. Where did you eat? I ate at 
Sabisa. Describe a meal for a freshman. Well, then

02:28.300 --> 02:30.502
we all ate the same thing. You had assigned tables. 
You marched in, and you sat down. And the freshmen

02:37.795 --> 02:41.539
served, the upperclassmen. And then the freshmen 
served themselves. And every article of food, of

02:43.461 --> 02:46.625
course, had a name. Sheriff the Chair. Well, bread 
was gun whiting. Dessert was kush. Salt and pepper

02:53.653 --> 02:58.898
was sand and nothing. You didn't call it anything 
by its name. If the food was considered inedible,

03:01.361 --> 03:06.807
it was served family style, both. a senior, a 
senior, who would sit at the head of the table, take

03:08.052 --> 03:22.613
that bowl, and here's a big passageway out there, 
and he'd put it out in the middle of the floor. And

03:24.796 --> 03:32.507
the waiters, who were students, they were called 
Sabisa volunteers, treated with great respect

03:24.796 --> 03:32.507
and reverence and told about it. They're waiters, 
but they're working their way through school, and

03:33.213 --> 03:38.800
you treat them with utmost respect. So nobody, 
because they had to work, was made to feel like they

03:40.582 --> 03:45.308
were any less. Very democratic. But now, you lost 
me on. Well, and they'd pick it up. Oh, okay. These

03:53.899 --> 03:55.781
waiters would pick it up and take it away. All 
right, what was, do you remember any real favorite

03:55.801 --> 04:00.867
food, Sabisa food of yours? No. What was the worst? 
Friday at noontime. What was it? Fish. Fish.

04:07.562 --> 04:11.908
Because in those days, it was required that the 
Catholics eat fish on Friday. Did you all have a

04:12.188 --> 04:13.350
name for it? I can't remember the name of it. All I 
know is I couldn't go in the mess hall. I could march

04:18.416 --> 04:21.380
down to the door, but I couldn't. The smell of it 
just was so offensive to me. Even when Sugar and I

04:25.365 --> 04:31.553
were married, she never cooked fish in the house 
because it made me sick. All right, then, what

04:31.904 --> 04:38.252
about drills? Where and how? We had the drill field 
there in front of the Memorial Student Center.

04:42.917 --> 04:43.698
Okay. But it wasn't just restricted. There was a 
lot of open space around. How often did you all

04:48.964 --> 04:50.606
drill? Once a week in your outfit, and sometimes 
more. For how long was that? Well, a couple hours,

04:55.933 --> 04:58.175
and some afternoon. And wearing what? Uniform. 
Everybody wore a uniform every day. Every day.

05:06.303 --> 05:06.784
Every day. Every day. All right. Now it's weekend. 
And during your four years, where could y'all go

05:12.331 --> 05:16.617
for a good time? No place.

05:20.843 --> 05:22.265
There were two places. I can't remember. 
Hardlickers was one. It was down past where Kyle

05:24.968 --> 05:29.815
Field is on the road to Weldon. Can you describe 
Hardlickers? Well, it was just a beer joint.

05:32.553 --> 05:38.402
Typical, true to form, beer joints. And what was 
the favorite beer of undergraduates then? I don't

05:41.086 --> 05:44.612
know, Jack's was in Pearl and whatever. John 
Lindsay thought it would be Grand Prize. Grand

05:47.015 --> 05:48.418
Prize. See, he's a Houstonian. Yeah, that's 
right. There was a Grand Prize brewery in Houston.

05:54.407 --> 06:00.957
As a matter of fact, the Grand Prize brewery in 
Houston opened their gates when there was an A&M

05:54.407 --> 06:00.957
Court trip to Houston. and the court took 
advantage of it. Go out there and get free beer. Was

06:06.440 --> 06:11.965
it permissible for y'all to drink beer at Hard 
Liquors? Sure. That was not contrary to any? No. Do

06:14.788 --> 06:18.131
you remember any 18 or older or 21 or older? No. No. I 
don't think there was at that time. No, in the first

06:21.414 --> 06:24.357
place, not very many out there because it cost 
money. And most of the kids were like me. They were

06:27.139 --> 06:28.841
too poor to even have a bag. Who was in there other 
than Aggies? Nobody. Oh, as far as I know. So it was

06:35.122 --> 06:37.786
almost all male. Yeah. Well, all weekends there 
would be some gals in there. All right. And what did

06:44.114 --> 06:50.842
you all call the place west of the river where you 
could buy alcohol? I don't remember. We called it

06:52.504 --> 06:54.146
across the river. It wasn't called Whiskey Bridge 
then? I had no recollection of it. It was at Easley

06:58.311 --> 06:59.833
Beach. It was on the other side of Bryce Road. How 
often did y'all go to Bryant? Again, it depended.

07:09.226 --> 07:15.452
See, called quarters was at 7.30, 7 o'clock, 7.30. 
And you could only, there was one night a week.

07:21.578 --> 07:29.145
Right back where Puryear and Long were was a, we 
called it the... Gosh, I can't remember what it

07:30.610 --> 07:31.851
was. It was a theater there.

07:36.656 --> 07:42.141
And they showed movies, and they were not every 
night of the week, one night of the week. It just

07:42.982 --> 07:51.810
wasn't easy to, you couldn't be out as a freshman or 
sophomore in my outfit after call to court without

07:42.982 --> 07:51.810
permission. Couldn't go to the library without 
permission. You couldn't do anything. What kind

07:57.340 --> 08:01.706
of activities occurred at Guyon Hall? None to my 
recollection. I only remember being there one

08:03.608 --> 08:06.051
time. So there weren't movies? I'm not saying 
there weren't movies. I don't remember. All I

08:10.938 --> 08:15.864
remember is that's where you got the message, look 
to your right, look to your left. Now only one of the

08:16.525 --> 08:21.171
three of you will be here four years from now. When 
was that message? Fish induction day. Was that

08:25.505 --> 08:28.409
when all of you were first brought together? 
Correct. Did you take, was there any ceremony or?

08:33.295 --> 08:36.199
No, there were no fish camps in those days. Okay. 
You just were told to be down there and that's where

08:36.439 --> 08:40.905
the big assembly building was. It was down at one 
end of the military wall, some beach at the other

08:41.165 --> 08:45.231
end. When you arrived, did you know the Aggie War 
Hymn and the spirit? No, you learned those pretty

08:50.197 --> 08:52.019
quickly. The South Forks are pretty quick 
teachers. Okay. Let's see. The easier you learn,

08:55.634 --> 09:02.800
the easier it is. When did you like A&M from the 
beginning?

09:09.886 --> 09:11.168
I like some things about it. I can't imagine 
anybody liking A&M your first year or even your

09:12.169 --> 09:20.816
second year. You just were nothing. Nothing. But 
you didn't leave. No. Yeah, lots left. No, but you

09:29.172 --> 09:29.753
did. No, but there were 45 freshmen, as I recall, in 
Mount Mary. And some drop out the first week. When

09:39.026 --> 09:43.612
things started clouding up, they had enough. Then 
you get your mid-semester report card. And

09:48.839 --> 09:54.827
grades, and if you're not there, they kick you out 
of

09:48.839 --> 09:54.827
school. And so a lot would leave at that time. All 
I'm saying is that there were 45 freshmen when we

09:59.092 --> 10:04.960
graduated, there were 12 seniors. So one, in our 
numbers, a fourth in your outfit. My outfit, yeah.

10:10.488 --> 10:12.450
Graduated on time in four years. As a matter of 
fact, every senior that was in my outfit didn't

10:12.471 --> 10:17.237
graduate in four years. My roommate, for example, 
he was still taking calculus. Was your roommate

10:23.815 --> 10:29.181
the same four years? No, no, no. No, he didn't 
graduate in four years. I don't know if he

10:33.065 --> 10:34.607
graduated in five. Did you have a special, special 
Aggie undergraduate friend or friends? Oh, yeah.

10:40.173 --> 10:40.534
Tell me. Well,

10:42.075 --> 10:48.883
curiously enough, they were not in my outfit. They 
were in my regimen. Joe Slicker was...

10:51.001 --> 10:54.505
S-L-I-C-K-E-R. Yeah. He was captain of the RVs my 
senior year, or our senior year, and he was from

10:55.186 --> 11:03.617
Cisco, Texas, and they called him the Cisco Kid. 
Then Dan Grant was from Dallas. James J.

11:09.764 --> 11:14.470
Gallagher, his father worked for the Katy 
Railroad, was from Smithville. He died two months

11:14.931 --> 11:16.273
ago. And myself. And... We were awfully close, 
very, very close. And what brought you together? I

11:28.557 --> 11:29.138
don't know. We were all in the RVs for one thing. We 
were all in the same regiment. We went to summer

11:37.628 --> 11:39.070
camp. We bought a car together. Oh, it cost us $30. 
It was a 29 Packard. Wouldn't we like to have it now?

11:47.949 --> 11:48.490
Lord have mercy. We sold it for $5. It quit running. 
We just left it on the street. And it was picked up by

11:53.296 --> 11:56.139
the sheriff or somebody. And somebody came by, I 
remember our senior year, at dinner time. And they

12:01.206 --> 12:05.631
said, Mayo, are you one of the owners of Blue 
Packard? I said, yeah. I said, where is it? He said,

12:07.293 --> 12:09.356
well, the police have it. He said, do you all want to 
sell it? I said, well, sure. So the others were

12:12.920 --> 12:15.143
nearby. Those three were all in D batter. I don't 
know.

12:25.323 --> 12:30.769
Well, first of all, Dan Grants had a nickname. His 
nickname was Snuffy. It was Joseph Slicker,

12:33.172 --> 12:37.538
Joseph Gallagher. And my middle name was Joseph. 
So we had Joe, Joe, Joe, and Snuffy. And we were the

12:42.944 --> 12:45.467
owners of that Packerdog. Was Derwood T. Varner 
one of your? No, Woody Varner? He was ahead of us.

12:55.258 --> 12:59.402
Woody Varner was the, he was a corps commander. My 
recollection is Wayne Stark was a regimental

13:01.825 --> 13:09.193
commander at the Coastal Territory while I was 
there. I forget whether he was in the class of 38 or

13:11.997 --> 13:22.154
39, I forget, maybe the 39 class, but I knew Woody 
Varner and saw Woody Varner after the war. As a

13:22.775 --> 13:26.902
matter of fact, after I came back from Washington, 
I saw him in Dallas. He was on the board of some big

13:28.785 --> 13:34.675
company, but I never had any society with him, no 
social My recollection of a little bit of homework

13:35.026 --> 13:40.897
is that he was an outstanding student in almost 
every measurable way. Well, that's one reason why

13:40.917 --> 13:44.363
he was a cadet colonel. I don't remember his class. 
Let's see, we asked about memorable, of your four

13:48.571 --> 13:58.249
years, were there some important teachers, 
advisors, important in shaping your life?

14:04.152 --> 14:05.313
I don't think so. Who'd you go to for advice? 
Nobody. In those days, you never talked to

14:10.059 --> 14:12.221
professors. It was brown nosy. So if you did that, 
and you just didn't do it, it was a no-no.

14:25.477 --> 14:32.505
When

14:25.477 --> 14:32.505
the seniors in my regiment went on active duty, We 
went to Fort Monroe, Virginia to artillery

14:34.544 --> 14:37.869
school. And after that, we were sent to two 
different regiments at Fort Bliss, Texas. And I

14:44.779 --> 14:47.583
wound up in the 63rd Coastal Artillery. This is 
before I transferred to the field. And there were

14:50.747 --> 14:57.057
17 second lieutenants from my class assigned to 
that regiment. 16 of them classmates of mine.

15:00.221 --> 15:04.247
There were 63 officers in that regiment. Yeah, 63, 
all West Pointers are Thomason Act officers, or

15:05.138 --> 15:16.250
some officers that had been reserved, had been 
called to active duty, and then this group of

15:05.138 --> 15:16.250
second lieutenants. When I got there where there 
were no OCS men, some came later out of that number

15:16.270 --> 15:23.198
one, number two, number three class. Boy, now you 
talk about soldiers and officers. They were, or

15:26.541 --> 15:31.206
they wouldn't have been in those early OCS 
classes. In any event, I was in that regiment until

15:32.881 --> 15:35.184
September 1942. And when I left, I was 1st 
Lieutenant, and I went by to pay my respects to the

15:35.304 --> 15:45.116
regimental commander, Popsky. We didn't call him 
Pop. He was a bird carol. When the war started, he

15:47.459 --> 15:49.501
was a bird carol. He just passed over. And we had a 
little visit to the regimental headquarters, and

15:53.105 --> 16:01.015
I told him what a pleasure it had been and a 
privilege to serve in his regiment. And I think

16:01.771 --> 16:10.959
that everybody held him in utmost respect and so 
forth. He said, I want to tell you something. He

16:14.042 --> 16:17.565
said, I know when this Aggie crowd hit this 
regiment. I remember it well. It was before the

16:18.546 --> 16:19.526
war. Everybody looking down their nose at you. Why 
don't you second lieutenant from that Texas A&M?

16:27.453 --> 16:30.296
Hey, this is Wes Warner talking. And he said, I'm 
losing all of you now. I said, I want to tell you that

16:37.212 --> 16:44.323
the first thing that I noticed, there wasn't an ass 
kisser among you. And I told him, I said, that was a

16:46.546 --> 16:49.511
no-no. It's good. I said, we called it in very 
vulgar terms and so forth. And I said, you called it

16:55.680 --> 16:57.323
ass kissing? And I said, yeah. We just didn't do it. 
Life would have been a hell if anybody ever saw you

17:03.065 --> 17:08.454
or heard that you had talked to a professor. 
Absolutely not. This was a terrible thing, but it

17:11.559 --> 17:14.884
was true. While you were a student, did students 
ever have a real physical fight? I never saw. Two

17:25.859 --> 17:26.740
Aggies fight. I understand they do it now 
sometimes. I heard of a couple involving the

17:29.863 --> 17:34.628
football team. Let's see, did I ask you about any 
kind of unique prank, Good Bull stunts that y'all

17:34.828 --> 17:43.558
heard of? No, other than airing out and floating.

17:50.465 --> 17:52.287
Religious activities on the campus? Some. Where? 
What sort? Well, none on the campus. That chapel

17:57.993 --> 18:00.436
hadn't been built in those days. But there were 
churches down at Northgate. Did many students go?

18:05.340 --> 18:06.662
I don't think so. I didn't. DeWare, what happened 
at DeWare Fieldhouse? Well, of course it was there

18:12.707 --> 18:15.830
and it's torn down now. But it was very much 
standing. And I know Charlie DeWare. It was named

18:18.613 --> 18:20.915
after his father. But DeWare is a long time Ackie 
family.

18:26.356 --> 18:31.984
There was no, what's the basketball stadium now 
that they've just turned the lights out? G.

18:32.004 --> 18:32.705
Raleigh. G. Raleigh wasn't there. But tell me 
about DeWare. Was it big? Did you think? No, but

18:38.213 --> 18:41.477
when you got there, did it seem big or little? It 
just was a gym. Okay. And did you ever go over there?

18:45.103 --> 18:45.423
Sure. Sure. We had intramurals there. Intramural 
basketball was in DeWare. And that's where the

18:52.233 --> 18:53.695
Aggies played. Yeah. Did a student ever get 
involved in intramurals? What do you mean, get

19:00.316 --> 19:01.597
involved? Did you ever participate? Oh, listen, 
it was very important. See, I'm asking you with a

19:06.363 --> 19:08.145
straight face. Yeah, well, it was very important 
in those days. The 54 batteries, troops, and

19:11.610 --> 19:22.603
companies were divided into leagues, and we 
played softball, football, a game called

19:11.610 --> 19:22.603
speedball. swimming, diving, track, 
volleyball, horseshoe, water polo. There were

19:31.678 --> 19:42.393
eight or nine intramural activities and one 
outfit was declared the intramural champion for

19:31.678 --> 19:42.393
the year. A very coveted thing. Was it considered a 
kind of a booby prize to be last? I don't know that it

19:51.642 --> 19:56.728
was a booby prize, because we didn't permit that in 
our outfit. We were one and two. We were just

19:59.331 --> 20:00.333
strong. What were the major optional student 
activity groups? Tell me about the Aggie band.

20:10.605 --> 20:17.734
Well, of course, the band was central to 
everything, as it is now, as far as the Corps is

20:10.605 --> 20:17.734
concerned, or even the university. Was it similar 
to, who was the band director? It was probably the

20:24.442 --> 20:30.832
roughest, toughest outfit on any pole. Who was the 
band director? Well, Colonel Toler's processer.

20:37.441 --> 20:39.304
I can't remember his name. Singing cadets? 
Singing cadets, yes. And where did they perform? I

20:44.051 --> 20:45.313
don't know. Just where they do now, I guess. I 
really don't know. I don't know that I ever heard of

20:49.017 --> 20:51.180
them more than once or twice. Was there a student 
government? No. No, the Corps was the government.

20:56.668 --> 20:59.091
You were talking about elections a while ago. Tell 
them about student elections. Well, they were

21:01.955 --> 21:04.218
just hat-card elections. You had a student body 
president, as I recall, and certainly I know you

21:05.100 --> 21:15.294
had a president of each of the classes. I'm not sure 
that we had a student body president. I doubt that

21:17.570 --> 21:18.632
we did. I think we just had class presidents. But 
I'm not sure about that. That was 57 years ago. Now,

21:24.360 --> 21:28.486
this hat cord, tell me about it. Well, the infantry 
wore blue hat cards, and they voted the way they

21:28.506 --> 21:32.773
were told to vote. We wore red hat cards. We voted 
the way we were told to vote. And where did they tell

21:37.660 --> 21:40.043
you how to vote? Well, right out in the broad 
daylight. They stood there and watched you vote.

21:44.873 --> 21:46.475
Where was the poll? In the academic building, in 
the old tunnel there. And the seniors would meet

21:51.762 --> 22:00.813
ahead of us and decide the alliances between the 
regiments and who they were going to vote for.

22:01.113 --> 22:02.575
Events during the year. R.B.' 's was a very 
important weekend. You did it during the Easter

22:06.600 --> 22:11.005
holidays when they left the campus. It was 
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, you're back

22:11.446 --> 22:14.830
in school on Monday The whole student body left the 
campus, except certain foreign countries or

22:15.468 --> 22:20.858
whatever. Kids couldn't get away. And that's when 
the RVs had the run of the campus. We had national

22:25.145 --> 22:27.389
bands come. We had a tea dance on Saturday 
afternoon, for example. It's a piece of it. And now

22:34.874 --> 22:40.101
this initiation that you talked about, that 
occurred early in April? Yes. And then the Easter

22:41.123 --> 22:46.811
break, that weekend, came after that. Well, 
that's right. You were a full company then. It

22:48.874 --> 22:51.798
might have been before the first of April. Could 
have been in March. Okay. And

22:55.223 --> 23:00.290
was there a bonfire? Sure. Where? Well, it was over 
on the other side of the railroad tracks, but it was

23:04.220 --> 23:10.830
not organized like it is now. There was no way. 
Well, what did you all burn up? Just scrap wood. Oh,

23:15.617 --> 23:17.120
they went out and collected wood. Where did they 
get it? Various places, and we never built an

23:19.744 --> 23:23.490
outhouse.

23:26.033 --> 23:27.756
You mean there was an outhouse on there each year? 
Each year. It came from North Bride. Different

23:31.922 --> 23:32.944
outfits. Went into North Moraine with a rope and a 
truck and pulled one down and loaded it up in back of

23:33.312 --> 23:42.361
the truck and put it up on top of the mine fire and 
burned it. Which, what students normally

23:42.381 --> 23:46.645
gathered most of the material? Well the 
underclassmen. The seniors didn't do anything.

23:51.229 --> 23:52.470
Okay, let's see. Then was there midnight yell 
practice? Sure. Before ever ball game. Held? For

23:59.677 --> 24:00.518
the Y. That's where all of y'all practiced. Okay. 
Silver Taps, tell me about that. Yes. Describe

24:07.119 --> 24:08.160
Silver Taps. Well, it's like it is today, except 
that everybody was there. Everybody was there.

24:15.813 --> 24:16.274
What did? Since most of them I lived on campus, you 
see. And I've gone out to Silver Taps there,

24:20.401 --> 24:26.792
Mitchell Hall my junior and senior year, in my 
pajamas and a rope. Just standing there because

24:27.127 --> 24:30.312
you're right there by the academic building. What 
did it mean to your heart? It meant a lot to

24:32.615 --> 24:36.140
everybody. Very important. Very important. Make 
believe that I had never heard of or seen Silver

24:39.545 --> 24:42.850
Taps. Describe it for me. Well, name, of course, 
for a student who had died since the last time he was

24:44.472 --> 24:55.007
out and was posted at the base of the flagpole in 
front of the academic building. So we knew who it

24:55.949 --> 24:57.150
was. Better remember the battalion was just 
published once a week in those days, not daily. And

25:03.377 --> 25:11.507
just before it got around, I think it was all 
Tuesday like it is now, and we had to do silver taps.

25:12.628 --> 25:21.218
And the

25:12.628 --> 25:21.218
RVs did not participate in it like it is now. And 
everybody just gathered there in front of the

25:21.238 --> 25:25.062
academic building. the whole cover, and they 
played the taps just the same as they do today.

25:32.767 --> 25:36.132
Nothing was ever said, no words, everything was 
very hushed. And after the silver taps played in

25:37.193 --> 25:42.180
each of the directions they played, it's all over. 
You just go back to your room. Your hole, we called

25:45.224 --> 25:48.288
it. All Britain Carillion was not there playing 
Christian hymns on the bells. The RVs didn't

25:54.095 --> 25:55.437
march. There was no rifle fire of any kind. It just 
was a very quiet, dignified cellar. Was there an

26:03.273 --> 26:04.574
Aggie muster? Sure. Where? Well, let me tell you. 
The muster was something that we talked about and

26:10.703 --> 26:18.974
in my day didn't do. And they didn't do it for some 
time before me. It was an old, old custom. And then

26:29.181 --> 26:30.182
it just died. You mean y'all didn't have a muster? 
No, we did not. We did not.

26:38.632 --> 26:49.224
Then on Corregidor,

26:38.632 --> 26:49.224
somebody remembered muster, a bunch of Aggies, 
April 21, 1941. Or it could have been 42. And it was

26:54.563 --> 26:56.045
revived then. And the word just spread throughout 
the Pacific Theater of Operations. And we had one

27:01.673 --> 27:05.739
on Okinawa in April 1945. They had them in Europe. 
The Army commander, Vinegar Joe Stillwell, the

27:09.965 --> 27:18.798
commanding general of the 10th Army on Okinawa.

27:19.239 --> 27:22.123
We landed on Okinawa on Easter Sunday. Aggie 
Pro-1, 1945, with 100,000 Japanese on it now.

27:27.857 --> 27:30.500
Bloodiest battle in the Pacific. Four Army 
divisions and two Marine divisions. And on the

27:34.704 --> 27:39.189
21st of April, there was a muster. And an order came 
down from Army headquarters, from Vinegar Joe

27:39.229 --> 27:44.715
Stillworth. If possible, Aggies can be 
temporarily relieved. We're fighting the

27:49.700 --> 27:51.402
Japanese. from their duties to attend their 
muster. And they had coordinates of a road

27:57.915 --> 28:02.660
junction. And guys, since you start showing up in 
Jeeps, they just parking here and there, and we got

28:02.680 --> 28:17.634
out of the Jeeps, we all made a circle, held hands, 
sang the spirit of Aggieland, got back in our

28:02.680 --> 28:17.634
Jeeps, went back to back to Japanese. And of 
course, we're not all there. I mean, all the Aggies

28:19.375 --> 28:21.237
weren't there. was a very important time. First 
muster I ever attended. Okay, let's go back to the

28:27.714 --> 28:30.518
campus now.

28:33.442 --> 28:34.844
You graduate in the spring of 1941. Correct. What 
world or national events during your

28:36.986 --> 28:44.977
undergraduate days do you remember kind of 
catching your attention? Well, I think it

28:45.478 --> 28:48.822
depended on who you were. What caught my attention 
was that war was imminent. was a subject matter of

28:52.199 --> 28:54.743
my speech on Mother's Day. I don't say I was more in 
tune with it, but others were. Plus the fact that I

29:00.511 --> 29:14.491
came in from class in April, I think it was, early, 
early April, maybe mid-April. And the first

29:16.314 --> 29:20.520
sergeant said, here's a letter for you. I said, 
when did you start? picking up my mail. I had two

29:24.867 --> 29:27.450
room orders. He said, this didn't come through the 
post office. It came through the commandant's

29:30.354 --> 29:32.357
office. It was ordering me and a whole host of 
others to active duties. And we were listed in

29:37.984 --> 29:41.488
there, given Army serial numbers. We were listed 
alphabetically where we were to go and when. I

29:45.413 --> 29:47.276
didn't make final review my senior year. We were at 
Fort Monroe, Virginia. Had a special exercise for

29:50.440 --> 29:52.142
a two or three hundred of us one week before, and a 
special commissioning exercise for us ahead of

29:53.202 --> 30:12.966
regular graduation and commissioning time, 
because we had to be at various places, Fort Monroe

29:53.202 --> 30:12.966
and some other place, on the very day that the final 
review was scheduled. Where were those

30:13.206 --> 30:22.838
ceremonies held, that commissioning and 
commencement for you all, do you remember?

30:23.054 --> 30:26.658
Who came to that? Did your mother come? Oh my Lord, 
no. My mother was on the campus one time. That was

30:32.024 --> 30:34.106
Mother's Day, my senior year. Some parents 
perhaps were there. So this was not a big event? No,

30:38.170 --> 30:40.473
no it wasn't. Not like they have today.

30:49.142 --> 30:52.065
So those of us that were on those orders had said, 
The following named second lieutenants, upon

30:52.484 --> 31:08.283
satisfactory completion of their academic work 
and being commissioned and so forth, are hereby

30:52.484 --> 31:08.283
ordered to active duty for one year.

31:11.046 --> 31:14.250
And of course this was, we're talking about April 
1941. Then in May of 1941 it became a reality. In the

31:18.195 --> 31:19.116
meantime, The draft was started in 1940. The 
National Guard was federalized in 1940.

31:27.989 --> 31:31.276
September of 39, the war in Europe started. So 
hell, we were at A&M, we knew that there was a war

31:31.296 --> 31:34.363
going on. Who did you all think would be the enemy?
