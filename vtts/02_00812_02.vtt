Charles Crawford, side two. Not a doctor. You're 
not a doctor? I'm sorry. You know, professors at

00:07.698 --> 00:11.024
A&M, you just assume that... In those days, there 
were very few doctors on the campus. Is that right?

00:14.890 --> 00:18.296
There were not half a dozen when I first came on the 
faculty. You didn't need your... If a man had a

00:20.860 --> 00:25.127
master's degree, he was considered pretty well 
qualified. I wish it were that way today. You need

00:26.768 --> 00:29.735
your doctorate to... It makes a difference. We 
were talking about council meetings and We were

00:37.882 --> 00:42.488
talking earlier about Lloyd Smith being the city 
manager. He, as I understand it, he was called a

00:42.508 --> 00:56.625
business manager until 1944, and the council then 
implemented the city manager type of government.

00:56.685 --> 00:57.967
Do you remember that? I sure don't. You don't? 
Okay. I have to admit I don't. All right. Do you

01:02.271 --> 01:06.395
remember how the operations of the city were 
financed? How did you go about financing whatever

01:06.475 --> 01:11.460
projects? Well, we had some city taxes, but they 
were very low, and we actually operated on a very

01:11.480 --> 01:28.695
small budget, just a shoestring, and the city 
manager, I don't imagine the city manager got more

01:29.333 --> 01:31.156
than $300 a month. And it was a full-time job. Yes, 
it was a full-time job.

01:39.768 --> 01:58.935
One time, another Mr. Brown, I can't think, he was a 
brother to Frank Brown, our main electrician for

01:39.768 --> 01:58.935
A&M, worked there in College Station in the city,

01:39.768 --> 01:58.935
worked city office, I don't remember exactly what 
his position was, but I remember he worked, he was

01:59.590 --> 02:16.886
former partner of Brown Allen Old Mobile Cadillac 
Company, former partner in that business. One of

02:16.906 --> 02:19.108
the councilmen? No, he wasn't a councilman. I 
don't remember what his position was. He was

02:22.992 --> 02:28.737
employed in some way, but I kind of believe he might 
have been city manager. One time. Oh, he might have

02:29.895 --> 02:30.896
been. Forgotten. After all, a good many years have 
passed since those days. That's right. Well, did

02:38.325 --> 02:43.451
Lloyd Smith present the problems to the council? I 
was wondering how, did he mainly take care of most

02:43.471 --> 02:47.416
of the problems? He took care of most of them and he 
just consulted with the people on the council and

02:47.436 --> 02:57.728
whenever we'd have meetings, we'd discuss all the 
problems and see what was going on and decide on

02:58.298 --> 03:04.146
things that needed to be done and he pretty well 
carried them out. Do you think this was a good type

03:05.087 --> 03:09.193
of way to operate a city? Well, I think at the time 
and under the circumstances why it wasn't bad. In

03:15.561 --> 03:27.057
fact, there was so little money available that it 
was more or less, they cut

03:30.260 --> 03:43.618
They operated just more or less on a very limited 
budget and carried on the business very

03:30.260 --> 03:43.618
informally. I guess for those years it wasn't bad. 
Wasn't bad. No. I think, okay, 1946, and this is

03:52.349 --> 04:04.508
towards the very end of your term, as I understood 
it from reading the minutes, the council decided

03:52.349 --> 04:04.508
to hold a bond election. Do you remember that? 
Because this is a big change. They never had, you

04:10.777 --> 04:18.289
know, had never borrowed a great sum of money 
before. Actually, I can't recall that. You can't

04:21.686 --> 04:23.088
recall the bond? No, I can't recall it. Well, I 
might have the dates mixed up, so it may not have

04:24.330 --> 04:29.359
happened during your term. Do you remember any 
kind of projects that the council wanted to do? For

04:34.827 --> 04:37.872
instance, you were talking about paving the 
streets. What other type of projects were you

04:38.674 --> 04:44.563
council interested in?

04:49.825 --> 05:06.746
I don't actually remember any projects, just 
day-to-day operation and financing the

04:49.825 --> 05:06.746
operation by our taxes and they were very low and 
the amount of work being done was very, very

04:49.825 --> 05:06.746
limited. So actually I don't remember any major 
projects except the street paving that was done by

05:08.087 --> 05:19.461
local

05:08.087 --> 05:19.461
forces And it was, I don't believe we let any 
contracts outside of the city at that time. Just

05:25.605 --> 05:36.080
went ahead and under the city manager, went up and 
had the streets graded, had the asphalt put down,

05:25.605 --> 05:36.080
and had the gravel put on top of that. It was all done 
locally. What streets were decided, how did you

05:39.425 --> 05:44.912
decide what streets would be paved this way? I 
believe that the streets that were paved that way

05:44.932 --> 05:48.958
were those The first that were south of the campus 
and they were only one or two, I

05:49.647 --> 06:07.502
guess there were three or four or five streets that 
were paved out for a half a mile from the campus. And

06:07.823 --> 06:10.385
the same thing up in College Hills, East Gate. 
There were several streets up there like Walton

06:11.125 --> 06:18.912
Drive and Main Drive up there. several of those 
streets were black topped with local labor and

06:19.297 --> 06:30.262
with local supervision. There was some point, and 
I'm not sure this is when you were council, that the

06:35.530 --> 06:49.323
people that were on the street had to petition to 
have curb and gutters put in and the city would

06:35.530 --> 06:49.323
finance one-third and then the people would 
finance the other two-thirds. Was that in your

06:50.284 --> 06:51.285
term? I don't believe it was. It was later on. Yes, I 
believe it was. We had very little curb in those

06:55.249 --> 06:57.551
days. It was just basically this black topping as 
you were... Yes, black topping. The fire and the

07:02.682 --> 07:06.025
police department were real small. The fire, you 
depended on A&M's fire department, and police

07:06.226 --> 07:13.073
maybe had one policeman? I think I was about right. 
About one policeman and just about all. Was this

07:21.982 --> 07:24.024
adequate? Well, for those days we had no 
particular trouble. We had, as I recall, we never

07:26.927 --> 07:32.132
had any real disturbance in Bryan. Occasionally 
somebody would have to be arrested, but it was

07:32.433 --> 07:38.279
very, very seldom. And we had very little police 
work in those days. And fire, were there not very

07:43.163 --> 07:50.030
many fires that you can remember? I don't remember 
any major fires. Maybe there was a few houses that

07:53.273 --> 08:00.280
were burned, but I really don't recall any major 
fires. And the city used the A&M's fire

08:00.783 --> 08:05.367
department? Yes.

08:09.971 --> 08:17.679
Today, College Station places a lot of importance 
on having enough parks for the people. Was this

08:18.279 --> 08:20.281
important when you were on the council? We hadn't. 
It was not important. People had very little

08:25.306 --> 08:30.030
recreation area. some areas that were left when 
the city was incorporated left vacant for parks,

08:30.263 --> 08:53.694
but as I recall, there's only a park of any 
considerable size or two, one down in the

08:30.263 --> 08:53.694
southwest of the campus and the other up in College 
Hills. There's a little area in College Hills

08:54.135 --> 08:58.701
that's about Howard Judge not more than three 
acres that's still in the parkway up there. And

09:04.202 --> 09:17.558
there's a pipe swing up there that belonged to my 
daughter and it was moved off the campus when I

09:04.202 --> 09:17.558
moved from the campus up there. And Frank Brown had 
pulled up from the ground and put it down out there

09:17.879 --> 09:26.730
in that park. Is this where Thomas Park is today? 
No, Thomas Park is in Bryan, isn't it? No, well, I

09:32.886 --> 09:39.016
think Thomas Park is, if I'm correct, is the one 
that's right behind City Hall today. Yes, I think

09:39.036 --> 09:42.461
that's... Is that where the park was? Well, that 
was used mainly for storage for equipment in those

09:42.762 --> 09:47.970
days. The area behind City Hall today? What 
used... Are you talking about the old City Hall

09:53.170 --> 09:56.394
down next to the railroad? No, sir, the one that's 
presently at Eastgate, the one that's where we had

09:56.414 --> 10:03.202
the City Hall today, it's right across. Well, this 
one is one up on Pereira. Pereira, this old park

10:07.968 --> 10:11.412
that you're talking about? Yes, that's the one I'm 
talking about. Okay, I know where that is. That's a

10:15.598 --> 10:19.262
couple blocks further back from the highway. So 
the council really wasn't all that concerned with

10:19.917 --> 10:24.565
recreation. No. This is something that's 
developed later on. Okay. Zoning has always been

10:29.013 --> 10:33.521
important in College Station. I don't think we had 
any zoning in those days. Oh, you don't remember

10:36.186 --> 10:37.388
any zoning? I don't remember any zoning. But we do 
today. Oh, yes. Why do you think they implemented

10:43.610 --> 10:45.673
it? Bryan doesn't have zoning, and College 
Station does. Well, I think it was a desire of some

10:50.179 --> 11:13.532
people to see that there was an orderly 
development of the area, and they didn't want the

10:50.179 --> 11:13.532
areas to be so cluttered with some residences and 
some better sizes, but there was very little

10:50.179 --> 11:13.532
zoning going on at that time. But later on they just 
wanted to make sure that they had... That's right.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.311
Orderly development was needed. And I think it's 
still needed. Do you think it's not having zoning

11:22.494 --> 11:43.384
has hurt the way Bryan has developed as far as... 
Well, you see it's become such a city that since

11:22.494 --> 11:43.384
Bryan was not zoned, why, there were little 
patches of business, a business house or two here

11:22.494 --> 11:43.384
and there, little areas covered not more than one 
or two blocks. And it has not meant a very orderly

11:47.394 --> 12:00.751
development of the city because some of the people 
object to having a business next door. And for that

12:01.552 --> 12:10.924
reason, why College Station, of course, has grown 
so rapidly in the last 15 years that if I think it was

12:11.950 --> 12:17.776
highly desirable that certain areas be 
restricted to certain purposes. Do you know why

12:20.178 --> 12:22.661
Bryan never zoned? Since it grew up so slowly and it 
developed. You see up until, compared with recent

12:27.926 --> 12:35.354
years, Bryan wasn't a very big town. I can remember 
Bryan when it was only 10,000 people. Oh really?

12:41.920 --> 12:48.008
And when we moved to Bryan, I bet there weren't more 
than 8,000 to 10,000 people in Bryan. And when was

12:49.891 --> 12:50.632
that? When I moved to Bryan? 1912. 1912. And it had 
been, I believe it has been a city or a settlement

12:54.256 --> 13:00.725
since like the 1840s. Somewhere around that. So 
it's an old city. And Harvey Mitchell, the man who

13:04.951 --> 13:11.860
had a lot of influence in helping establish A&M, 
was one of the merchants. The story is told that a

13:14.920 --> 13:31.037
stranger rode up out to Boonville, which is about 
three miles east of Brown, out towards the road

13:14.920 --> 13:31.037
that leads over to Rams County and Highway 105. 
Now, not 105 either. Forgotten the number. But

13:34.440 --> 13:41.728
anyway, there was a store there that had general 
merchandise. and there was a man sitting on the

13:42.198 --> 13:44.902
store gallery. You know what a gallery is? No. We 
call it a porch. The porch. Little porch or

13:49.388 --> 13:51.151
gallery. There was a man sitting there, and this 
stranger rode up on a horse and says,

13:51.171 --> 14:00.945
this man greeted him and says, get down, stranger. 
So he got down, came up, and he says,

14:02.487 --> 14:09.657
who is the...

14:11.898 --> 14:14.742
I guess he was mayor. He says, Harv Mitchell. He 
says, well, courthouse right across there. Is

14:21.813 --> 14:23.115
that the courthouse? He said, yes. He says, who's 
county judge? He says, Harv Mitchell. He asked

14:28.803 --> 14:32.749
several others, talked a little bit longer. He 
says, I want to get the county clerk to record

14:32.829 --> 14:37.196
something. He says, who is county clerk? He says, 
Harv Mitchell. Finally the man looked at him and

14:40.636 --> 14:45.963
says, is Harvey Mitchell the whole damn town? He 
said, no, not at all. He said, I'm Harvey Mitchell.

14:52.991 --> 14:53.732
Oh, how funny. That story, of course, I don't know 
whether it's true or not, but that's one I've heard

14:55.034 --> 15:01.182
many, many years ago. Was this, if I've got this 
straight, he was in Boonville, at a store in

15:01.502 --> 15:06.228
Boonville? Boonville, yeah. Harvey Mitchell was 
sitting there? Okay, okay. You know that the

15:09.543 --> 15:19.281
building right next to the YMCA is Boyle Health 
Center. Uh-huh. That occupies the site that

15:19.461 --> 15:22.787
Harvey Mitchell Hall used to be on. Oh, really? 
That was a three-story building. I believe it was a

15:27.135 --> 15:29.099
four-story building. Anyway, it was the site 
of... Harvey Mitchell Hall, named after Harvey

15:32.982 --> 15:36.408
Mitchell. The pictures of the old buildings that 
are in your book, they're very beautiful

15:36.428 --> 15:40.876
buildings. I'm sorry they don't exist today. I

15:43.360 --> 15:48.829
know. We've talked a little bit about this, but as I 
read the papers, there's a rather historic

15:48.869 --> 15:58.686
rivalry between Bryan and College Station. After 
the organization of the College Station as a city,

15:59.307 --> 16:04.956
there was a good deal of rivalry. There was a great 
deal of rivalry? And some of the people felt very

16:07.139 --> 16:10.825
strongly about it. There were a couple of men in 
Bryan who felt strongly about it, and then that

16:10.845 --> 16:20.319
engendered an anti-feeling out here. So it was 
some pretty pretty strong rivalry and pretty

16:23.135 --> 16:33.846
sharp words passed between some of the people 
between Bryan and College Station and yeah, Bryan

16:23.135 --> 16:33.846
and College Station. Did the councils try to 
maintain peaceful relations? We always had good

16:39.292 --> 16:42.035
relations with people in Bryan. I know of no time 
when I was on the council had anything to do with it.

16:48.361 --> 16:50.784
There was ever any real friction. Do you remember 
Mayor Langford had a brother, Ivan, and he was the

16:52.582 --> 16:57.648
mayor of Bryan, I believe. He was mayor of Bryan for 
several terms and was later president of the Bryan

16:57.728 --> 17:04.796
Building and Loan. He was. He was in that new 
building when it was built at the present location

17:05.998 --> 17:14.688
of Bryan Building and Loan, which is now called 
Brazos Building and Loan. Right, I've seen that.

17:16.510 --> 17:22.217
Which has now been bought by the city savings and 
loan of San Angelo. Oh, really? I didn't know that.

17:26.096 --> 17:28.819
Same one that bought the community savings loan 
out here. Oh, they bought that, too? Yes, they just

17:30.681 --> 17:32.463
bought it. I didn't know they had. Those of us who 
own stock in it turned in our stock certificates

17:33.725 --> 17:39.131
within the last few days. Because San Angelo 
bought the community savings bank that is on

17:40.312 --> 17:46.279
University? Yeah. It was bought by San Angelo? 
That's right. It was bought by City Savings Loan of

17:49.623 --> 17:52.947
San Angelo. which is owned by the Lamar Savings 
Loan of Austin. Are they going to still call it

17:57.791 --> 18:00.554
Community Savings Loan? I don't know whether 
they'll continue to call it that or not. Well, you

18:03.978 --> 18:05.900
turned in your stock certificate. Did they pay you 
for it? Well, they will. They will. Haven't yet. We

18:11.867 --> 18:14.631
were talking about the rivalry between Bryan. Do 
you know of any examples, anything that you can

18:14.891 --> 18:22.360
point to that might illustrate it, I guess?

18:25.664 --> 18:37.321
I know that Mayor

18:25.664 --> 18:37.321
Jaeger was quite active in trying to incorporate 
College Station into Bryan. And I don't know of

18:39.384 --> 18:52.903
any, yes I do, there was a lawyer by the name of Loth 
Henderson who was quite active in wanting to

18:39.384 --> 18:52.903
incorporate College Station into Bryan. And I 
think they were two of the men that really did their

18:53.575 --> 19:04.856
best to prevent College Station being organized 
as a city. I know that when Mr. Gilchrist was here as

19:07.220 --> 19:16.798
president, why, he and some of the men of Brown who 
acted at that time would pace each other and

19:17.639 --> 19:21.323
wouldn't speak. Oh, really? Do you remember them 
going to the, I guess it might have been Attorney

19:23.765 --> 19:35.677
General, Brian, these Brian men, and trying to 
keep them from being College Station

19:23.765 --> 19:35.677
Incorporated? No, I don't remember

19:35.697 --> 19:41.963
that. Okay. Did the council have any specific plan 
for growth? No, no particular plan. It really

19:50.300 --> 19:52.602
wasn't growing that fast? No, it was growing 
steadily but not rapidly. Like today, for

19:58.268 --> 20:00.090
instance. Of course, the comparison between then 
and today is a contrast rather than a comparison

20:00.290 --> 20:12.182
because College Station and Bryan have become 
cities now. And in those days, they were just

20:13.006 --> 20:15.969
country towns. They were just country towns, even 
Brian was. Do you remember any big problem during

20:22.255 --> 20:26.820
your term? Any big problem that the council had to 
deal with?

20:33.246 --> 20:34.087
Really, I don't. I don't even recall any major 
problems that came up. Of course, I'm sure there

20:38.892 --> 20:43.116
were some, but I wasn't involved, so I don't 
recall. Do you feel like there was anything that

20:43.957 --> 20:55.487
you can name as a great achievement or one of the 
biggest achievements that the city and the

20:43.957 --> 20:55.487
council took care of when you were on the council?

20:59.010 --> 21:02.193
I sure couldn't say that there was anything. It was 
a great achievement because we were going along

21:02.273 --> 21:08.038
very

21:10.583 --> 21:18.654
shall I say sedately and quietly and developing as 
new homes were built in the area. And after it was

21:19.155 --> 21:23.320
unincorporated, of course, the area began to 
build up. And that's the time when the Eastgate

21:23.981 --> 21:30.890
area developed several stores. And the

21:31.671 --> 21:40.303
bus used to stop over at the Eastgate But then came 
on into the campus and had a little stop on the

21:40.756 --> 22:00.978
corner of where next to the telephone office and 
had the bus stop right along there. But in those

22:00.998 --> 22:09.767
days, it was just a very quiet little town going 
along about its business. A&M was, at that time,

22:10.102 --> 22:18.170
only about 3,000 or 3,500 students. See, when I 
entered A&M, there were only 1,100 students in

22:18.190 --> 22:22.114
all. And half of those, nearly 600 of them, were 
freshmen. Oh, my heavens. Half of them were

22:28.180 --> 22:30.102
freshmen. And you see, that meant that the 
buildings on the campus take care of things pretty

22:38.806 --> 22:40.288
well. And academic building was always one of the 
major class buildings, classroom buildings. And

22:48.780 --> 22:52.044
that's where the president's office was for many 
years. You see, the old main building burned in

22:53.146 --> 22:57.031
1912. And they think it was an arson. Oh, they did? A 
bunch of students. Oh, how terrible. It destroyed

23:05.823 --> 23:07.125
the building there. They tried to tried to knock 
down the walls of that building after the fire, and

23:09.856 --> 23:22.295
they got some of the artillery cannons from A&M and 
got out there and tried to shoot those walls down,

23:09.856 --> 23:22.295
and they couldn't budge them. Those cannonballs 
would go into those walls. They were about two feet

23:26.462 --> 23:37.078
thick, two and a half feet thick, but it was a loss of 
a real good building there, and it was a real

23:26.462 --> 23:37.078
setback for A&M. They don't make buildings like 
that today, do they? No, they don't. I'll tell you,

23:41.282 --> 23:45.806
the present academic building is built almost 
that way. It's very thick walls. It looks that way.

23:48.888 --> 23:50.209
And Dr. F.E. Gieske was the architect on that 
building. He was one of the first two A&M graduates

23:55.414 --> 24:02.220
to get a degree in A&M. Oh, and become an architect. 
Later on, he was... head of the architecture

24:05.898 --> 24:13.247
department, head of the drawing department, then 
also head of architecture and architectural

24:05.898 --> 24:13.247
engineering.

24:16.871 --> 24:20.054
You said that there was some stores that built at 
Eastgate. What were these stores that built at

24:20.175 --> 24:21.736
Eastgate? Luke's Grocery was the only one that I 
remember. I believe that there was a real estate

24:25.080 --> 24:30.667
office, Color Pepper Real Estate, if I'm not 
mistaken. But Luke's Grocery was the main one and

24:33.623 --> 24:42.481
that's where people in that area over there across 
the road, highway, traded mostly. What were the

24:43.524 --> 24:46.309
citizens of College Station like? What was the 
character of the town? Mainly good old country

24:48.734 --> 24:50.959
folks. Very friendly? Yes, very friendly. Since 
you have your south and your east and your north, do

24:54.042 --> 25:01.110
you feel like that divided the city? Was the city 
unified? It didn't unify, but it didn't seem to

25:03.052 --> 25:06.375
separate. In other words, it was a matter of 
convenience. It wasn't a matter of rivalry so

25:09.719 --> 25:11.481
much. It was a matter of convenience for the people 
who lived close to the campus. North Gate has been

25:18.410 --> 25:23.155
there the longest, then the South Gate, and then 
East Gate. And as the area developed, residential

25:23.756 --> 25:32.305
area, why, the people in that area, a lot of them 
didn't have automobiles. Automobiles were not as

25:33.566 --> 25:37.891
numerous in that day as they are now. But it was no 
particular rivalry. It's just a matter of

25:41.695 --> 25:43.417
convenience. From having stores there? Yeah, 
having stores where they can shop. Did College

25:48.667 --> 25:53.655
Station have any kind of transportation for its 
citizens? No. At one time there was a bus that ran

25:54.597 --> 26:01.267
out from Bryan to College Station. I don't know how 
to call it. Bryan, after the

26:04.733 --> 26:15.130
trolley was discontinued, there was a bus 
service. And lots of people rode the bus for a good

26:15.802 --> 26:20.906
many years from Bryan out to College Station. But 
as far as getting around College Station, there

26:21.467 --> 26:25.931
really wasn't... No, there was nothing. No bus 
service within the city itself. It's between

26:30.695 --> 26:32.657
Bryan and College Station. Can you describe the 
leadership of Ernest Langford? He ran the city for

26:37.801 --> 26:43.606
20 years, and unfortunately he died a couple years 
ago. So... Ernest

26:45.232 --> 27:02.794
Langford was a very unusual individual and he came 
to A&M in the drawing department after he'd been

26:45.232 --> 27:02.794
out of school, out of A&M, only about two or three 
years. He went over to Austin and was in

27:03.555 --> 27:13.568
architectural drafting as a draftsman, as an 
architect over there for about I think it was about

27:13.936 --> 27:17.479
three years, and that's where he married. And he 
and

27:18.280 --> 27:42.863
Ms. Langford were married in Austin and came to 
College Station, and he taught for several years

27:18.280 --> 27:42.863
until Dean Nagel, he had an opportunity for a 
scholarship up at the University of Illinois, and

27:18.280 --> 27:42.863
he went in to see Dean Nagel about it, Dean Nagel was 
the first dean of engineering at A&M in 1911 or 12.

27:50.071 --> 27:57.460
And when he told Mr. Nagel about it, why, Mr. Nagel 
says, I want you to take it. He said, I'll write out

27:57.480 --> 28:00.223
your resignation right now. He said, I'll take 
care of that. So he just practically pushed him out

28:02.686 --> 28:05.168
the door. And he went to University of Illinois. 
And he was at University of Illinois about, I don't

28:12.121 --> 28:27.174
know, six or seven years where he got his master's 
degree and also designed one of the houses that won

28:12.121 --> 28:27.174
a national award for a two-story

28:12.121 --> 28:27.174
home. And then after Dean Bolton became dean, he 
got Mr. Lankford to come back in the architecture

28:28.095 --> 28:40.086
department because There'd been several 
architects in the meantime, and he got Mr.

28:40.589 --> 28:46.497
Langford back. And

28:47.238 --> 28:59.654
Mr. Langford was head of the architecture 
department from, I'm not sure of the years, but I

28:47.238 --> 28:59.654
would say for at least 20 years. He was made head of 
architecture, I believe, the same summer that I

29:00.214 --> 29:06.783
was made head of mechanical engineering. I'm not 
positive of that, but I think that's right. at that

29:09.884 --> 29:10.625
time. And then when he was elected mayor, he spent 
many, many hours down at the office there and

29:10.785 --> 29:26.562
devoted a great deal of time to the city. And he did, 
I guess he made as big a contribution to the city of

29:27.803 --> 29:35.091
College Station as any one man ever did. And he

29:40.141 --> 30:09.608
was also when he retired he was made archivist and 
at that time we had no archival department and he

29:40.141 --> 30:09.608
became archivist and was given one room over in the 
MSC as his and he began to collect things

29:40.141 --> 30:09.608
he was the second archivist Mr. Cofer was the first 
and Mr. Cofer retired professor of English and He

30:10.465 --> 30:15.993
served as archivist for, I'd say, two or three or 
four years. And then Mr. Lankford came in. And he

30:18.696 --> 30:29.792
occupied that office until the new

30:18.696 --> 30:29.792
Cushing Library was built. And they gave him a room 
in the Cushing Library. And he was archivist there

30:33.036 --> 30:39.645
for a good many years. He read extensively. He was a 
very voracious reader and also wrote a number of

30:42.468 --> 30:57.949
pamphlets and things that had to do with the 
development of A&M University, Texas A&M. But he

30:57.969 --> 31:10.847
had one son, Keith, and Keith, after he moved off 
the campus and built his home, down on Langford

31:11.182 --> 31:20.573
Street, where he and Leela lived there until Mr. 
Langford died. Mr. Langford died at about 91 years

31:21.053 --> 31:23.236
old. Oh, I know. Yeah, something like that. But Ms. 
Langford still lives down there, and I talk to her

31:27.261 --> 31:31.205
occasionally. Do you know what subdivision that 
is in? No, I don't. It's on Langford Drive. Yeah.

31:37.553 --> 31:38.674
Named for him. That's right. Well, as a mayor, did 
he show a lot of foresight? Did he want to plan? Yes,

31:46.634 --> 32:00.213
he did quite a bit of planning, and he had a lot to do 
with the development and layout of the streets and

31:46.634 --> 32:00.213
things at College Station, especially that south 
Texas area. Also, he was instrumental in working

32:00.233 --> 32:06.923
in that northeast area up there where I lived. But 
he made a good mayor and devoted a lot of time to it,

32:07.477 --> 32:17.448
and especially in setting taxes and tax hearings, 
things like that. He was quite active in things

32:17.528 --> 32:20.091
like that. Well, he sounds like a remarkable man. 
He was a remarkable individual. Did you have any

32:25.397 --> 32:33.966
time on the council that some of the council 
members had different opinions? There was only

32:34.006 --> 32:35.728
one time. while I was on the council in those four 
years, that we had a real disagreement and

32:36.282 --> 32:47.953
difference of opinion and had a split vote. And 
that split vote was about five to one. What was it

32:53.598 --> 32:54.299
over? Over giving special electric rates to the 
First Baptist Church. And what was the outcome?

33:07.169 --> 33:18.486
Well, I don't remember exactly what it was, but 
they worked out a program that was mutually

33:07.169 --> 33:18.486
agreeable between Brother Brown and the rest of 
the council. Oh, I see. I see. He wanted electric

33:20.129 --> 33:21.932
rates. That was the only time that we ever had a real 
split in the vote. Was Mr. Langford able to? He was

33:28.542 --> 33:30.184
pretty politic in there. I only saw him lose his 
temper one time during the whole time that I worked

33:30.434 --> 33:43.219
with him, and that was with Mr. Clark, who 
developed that southwest area. But he and Mr.

33:43.881 --> 33:47.027
Clark had a difference of opinion. He kind of lost 
his temper one time. Do you remember what that was

33:50.296 --> 33:53.381
all about? It was about some tax renditions in 
areas where Professor Clark was developing

33:53.401 --> 34:02.193
new... The Knoll? Yeah, Knoll. And Dr. Clark 
didn't agree with the tax assessment? Well, we

34:09.524 --> 34:11.567
didn't agree with Dr. Clark. He wanted certain tax 
concessions and renditions much lower than we

34:17.920 --> 34:21.786
felt was reasonable. And we just disagreed with 
him and put him down. And so the council set the rate

34:27.574 --> 34:32.761
and he had to pay it? Well, it was just a matter of, 
you know, they have what they call an equalization

34:32.781 --> 34:37.608
board. And they get together every year, or I guess 
it is every year, maybe every other year, and go

34:38.309 --> 34:46.982
over the renditions and see if taxes have been 
rendered somewhat equally and equal values equal

34:47.232 --> 35:17.020
equal projects and I've served on that two or three 
different times and we always tried to look at the

34:47.232 --> 35:17.020
situation find out other where other houses were 
valued just about the same that were equal value

34:47.232 --> 35:17.020
cost and It was just a matter of routine operation.

35:23.776 --> 35:29.543
Of course, we had tried to keep the tax values down 
and keep them at least equalized. That was the

35:30.644 --> 35:34.007
whole point of it. And the assessment that the 
board made, Dr. Clark, was in agreement? Well, the

35:37.611 --> 35:43.898
assessments were made by the city, by the council 
and the city. I don't remember who was on the tax

35:43.958 --> 35:47.682
board, but the I

35:48.033 --> 35:57.086
can't think of the name of that group, the 
Equalization Board. We would be appointed from

35:57.647 --> 36:07.842
year to year in different groups, and they would 
try their best to satisfy the people and to see that

35:57.647 --> 36:07.842
things were fair. Did most people pay their taxes? 
Oh, yes. Very little trouble with people not

36:12.428 --> 36:15.873
paying taxes. So the character of the town was a... 
Oh yeah. Very caring type of town. Most people

36:21.360 --> 36:28.828
cooperating with, most people in College Station 
were pretty proud of this city. They were pleased

36:28.848 --> 36:30.550
with it. They had reason to. And you see when they, 
you kept the same mayor for nearly 20 years, well

36:31.932 --> 36:38.919
you know that things were running along pretty 
smoothly. That's right. Wasn't much division.

36:41.702 --> 36:42.183
That's right. Very good point. As I was reading 
your book, I noticed that many of the professors in

36:44.632 --> 36:56.906
the engineering department or people who were 
connected with the engineering department also

36:44.632 --> 36:56.906
became involved with the city. There's all sorts 
of men. Is there any particular reason? Well, they

37:02.273 --> 37:06.418
were just interested and felt like they could 
render a service. Now, Joe Orr was a professor of

37:06.438 --> 37:13.626
civil engineering, and there's a street down 
there named Orr Street. It was a matter of interest

37:14.230 --> 37:19.876
and a matter of feeling that they could do a job that 
was worthwhile. Can you tell me anything about Mr.

37:21.038 --> 37:22.780
Orr? He also, his dad, he seemed to also be a leader 
in the community. Joe was pretty forthright in his

37:28.106 --> 37:34.633
speaking and his approach to things. And if he 
disagreed, why, he said so. He spoke up and

37:38.017 --> 37:41.301
expressed himself. But as a civil engineer, he was 
interested in, of course, the streets and the

37:41.281 --> 38:02.541
paving, and did have quite a bit of influence in 
some of the major engineering problems in the

37:41.281 --> 38:02.541
city. So, Joe was, had been in South America after 
he graduated from A&M and came back to A&M and was

38:09.428 --> 38:17.419
mainly surveying. And he was one of the few, at that 
time, one of the few licensed land surveyors in the

38:17.959 --> 38:25.089
area. And he trained lots of students in the area of 
plain surveying. He surveyed the boundaries of

38:31.357 --> 38:34.281
College Station. I think he also surveyed this 
spot right here. Oh, really? For Bryant? Yeah.

38:40.273 --> 38:41.535
Well, he did it for me. I wanted to have my corners 
specified and have them certified, so I got a

38:41.696 --> 38:53.294
licensed surveyor to do that after I bought the 
lot. But do you feel like College Station was lucky

38:54.336 --> 38:58.663
to have men such as? Yes, I do. I think those men 
served well and did a good job. I think it was a very

39:04.412 --> 39:06.756
unselfish service. and you didn't receive any 
money. No, no money. But is there an advantage in

39:11.321 --> 39:19.852
having people from a university running the city? 
Well, it's changed now. So the city and the

39:22.135 --> 39:27.202
university both have completely changed. 
They're not the same place they were 30 years ago.

39:31.808 --> 39:35.292
And at that time, the majority of people at the 
college station were employed by A&M. Today, that

39:39.518 --> 39:40.900
isn't the case. That's true. The same way with 
Brian. You see, at present time, the faculty of A&M

39:45.469 --> 39:53.103
forms, say, 2,500 people. I don't know what it is, 
but out of 50,000.

39:59.116 --> 40:01.018
So that's a very small percentage. In those days, 
it was a much larger percentage. Almost all of the

40:03.660 --> 40:05.061
people. That's right. That's interesting.

40:11.226 --> 40:11.907
Let me see. How do you feel about the way College 
Station has developed? There's a push to bring

40:16.871 --> 40:19.773
more industry in this area. Do you feel like that is 
needed here? Or why didn't you want it when you were

40:22.836 --> 40:27.160
coming down? Since it's become a city. why it's 
pretty necessary that they have some industry.

40:35.948 --> 40:48.722
And I'm not too happy with large quantity of 
industry, but it's necessary to develop a city to

40:35.948 --> 40:48.722
have a tax base that can do things. And if you don't 
have some industry,

40:49.423 --> 40:59.413
all the burden has to be borne by ad valorem tax on 
property. And if you want to expand and really have

40:59.798 --> 41:11.151
some activity, why, you need the industry. Now 
then, I've been surprised at the amount of heavy

41:11.171 --> 41:15.456
industry in North Brown. I know. There's a lot. 
There's much more industry there than I had any

41:17.318 --> 41:22.324
idea would ever develop in Brown. Now, College 
Station is trying to get some medium industries.

41:29.178 --> 41:36.247
Also, something in the way of advanced 
technology.

41:36.267 --> 41:37.809
To go along with the college? And this Texas 
Instruments out here is located right across the

41:37.829 --> 41:45.958
East Bypass. And since it is a highly scientific 
group, it can tie in with the instruction. And it's

41:55.510 --> 41:57.953
a good contact. for students and for the 
university. And with several of those, that type

42:01.564 --> 42:09.212
of industry, why, it would become a real asset to 
our teaching. So it is, now, in some ways, it

42:10.594 --> 42:27.012
doesn't improve the residential area, but if it's 
properly segregated and properly zoned, why, it

42:10.594 --> 42:27.012
still doesn't, those industries are pretty good 
neighbors. And they quite often do things that are

42:32.298 --> 42:43.494
needed, and they also separate their areas from 
the residential area in a way that isn't very

42:32.298 --> 42:43.494
objectionable. When you were on the council, 
however, We didn't have problems like that. You

42:50.267 --> 42:53.390
didn't need to worry about bringing in industry? 
You didn't feel like it was, town was ready for it?

42:56.133 --> 43:03.199
We weren't concerned with

42:56.133 --> 43:03.199
it. How would you have liked to see College Station 
develop differently, or would you have?

43:13.269 --> 43:16.472
Well, to tell you the truth, I've

43:19.169 --> 43:20.851
don't know the answer to that question. I don't 
know how it would have been very different. And

43:25.135 --> 43:40.952
since it grew up gradually and changed over a long 
period of time, and I was here all that time, the

43:25.135 --> 43:40.952
changes were so gradual that I wasn't too aware of 
just how it was going, especially in recent years.

43:41.172 --> 43:43.675
See, I've been retired nearly 18 years. And since 
that time, boy, there's lots of development been

43:44.255 --> 43:48.720
going on. So I really wasn't too involved in it. Is 
there anything else that you would like to add that

43:54.623 --> 43:58.607
I haven't asked about? Any

43:58.867 --> 44:06.815
bit of information that would be interesting to 
people about College Station? Well, of course,

44:06.855 --> 44:14.382
you're interested in the city of College Station 
more than you are in Texas A&M, aren't you? Well,

44:14.402 --> 44:18.606
yes, sir, but I know they're tied together. There 
have been certain people that have contributed to

44:19.413 --> 44:27.540
A&M that I think stand out. For instance, Dean 
Nagel, first dean of engineering. And he was head

44:31.964 --> 44:38.009
of the civil engineering department. And then you 
see one time civil engineering and physics were

44:39.170 --> 44:44.955
combined. Of course, most people don't know that. 
He was dean of engineering for several years and

44:49.282 --> 45:03.355
then he became Texas' first

44:49.282 --> 45:03.355
water engineer. And he went to Austin and was gone 
for a few years and during that time Dean Spence was

45:05.417 --> 45:17.128
dean, but Dean Spence died after a few years and 
they got Dean Nagel back here. And Dr. Brazell was,

45:17.682 --> 45:23.888
I think, one of the outstanding presidents that 
A&M has ever had. And then Dean Nagler resigned a

45:26.111 --> 45:33.178
second time, and that's when Dean Bolton became 
Dean of Engineering. And Dean Bolton had a lot to do

45:33.699 --> 45:36.842
with A&M. He was a very quiet individual, but very 
thorough, and he was known as Bad Tracks. That was

45:50.932 --> 45:54.306
his nickname, head of the electrical engineering 
department. He first started as professor.
