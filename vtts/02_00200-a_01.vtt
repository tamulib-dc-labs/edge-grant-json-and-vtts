WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:14.398
We're in the sixth floor of the library, and I have 
the joy of chatting with John Thomas about his A&M

00:03.220 --> 00:14.398
experiences, just so recent, a young man like him. 
John, try your mic and see how it works. Well, we'll

00:16.942 --> 00:18.845
see if it picks up. I'll bet it does.

00:23.293 --> 00:29.042
John, to begin with, to introduce yourself to a 
reader or a listener in future years, Describe

00:29.647 --> 00:33.760
family background, where you grew up, where you 
went to high school. Tell about yourself before

00:34.101 --> 00:37.271
coming to A&M. Well, I was born in Pampa, Texas. 
better known for the home of Randy Mattson. Dad was

00:45.035 --> 00:47.798
working in the oil fields then. He was a roommate of 
Earl Rudders at Tarleton. When Earl left

00:52.342 --> 01:00.270
Tarleton, he came to A&M, and Dad

00:52.342 --> 01:00.270
went to the oil fields for 10 years. That was right 
at the tail end of the Depression. He spent 10 years

01:03.954 --> 01:07.618
there and then came back to A&M. I was about three 
when he came back to school here. He went as county

01:13.675 --> 01:26.514
extension agent, assistant agent at Naples and 
then in February of 42 moved to Wellington,

01:13.675 --> 01:26.514
Collingsworth County as county agent. Was there 
17 years. was in the middle of the first grade when

01:29.249 --> 01:57.737
we got to wellington and graduated high school 
there how big wellington and wellington had about

01:29.249 --> 01:57.737
33 3400 population when we got there it was a 
ranching and farming community right against

01:29.249 --> 01:57.737
oklahoma

01:29.249 --> 01:57.737
there in the early 50s in my high school years i got 
out in 55 and came to A&M but during the 50s that

01:58.122 --> 02:14.908
drought and population had reached about 51, 
5,200 county populations about 25,000 and we

01:58.122 --> 02:14.908
lived on a farm there. I grew up in 4-H club work and 
A&M

02:15.509 --> 02:22.780
was Probably because of my interest in ag and 
particular interest in entomology as a result of

02:24.211 --> 02:34.842
having kept honeybees for a 4-H club project. I was 
aware that A&M was the only place you could go and

02:36.284 --> 02:43.912
major in entomology and a strong ag school, and we 
had come to 4-H Roundup. Back then, coming to

02:43.972 --> 02:50.019
College Station was about like going to China. It 
was a long way away. And describe one of those

02:53.405 --> 02:54.930
trips. How did y'all get here? Well, usually we 
came in either a packed car or in a pickup pulling a

02:56.416 --> 03:04.444
trailer with four club calves. We did show at 
Houston and at Dallas and Sulphur Springs. We had

03:10.341 --> 03:20.031
judging teams that went to Lubbock and West Texas 
State for competition and Roundup then down here

03:10.341 --> 03:20.031
in Stephenville. Those were the towns that hosted 
many of these teams and that's where you got

03:20.051 --> 03:34.667
exposed to the world is when you went to a livestock 
show with an animal or went on a judging trip with

03:34.647 --> 03:36.049
the team. Do you remember your first visit ever to 
College Station? Yeah I do. When I got into

03:43.957 --> 03:59.535
beekeeping in 1947

03:43.957 --> 03:59.535
I had kept bees and I got an invitation to speak at 
the Texas Beekeepers Association meeting

03:43.957 --> 03:59.535
November 1950. My mama put me on a train at 
Childress and I rode the train all day we stopped at

04:04.347 --> 04:33.831
Hearn about it was just getting dark and that's 
where you ate we had eaten lunch at Dallas and we ate

04:04.347 --> 04:33.831
supper at Hearn arrived

04:04.347 --> 04:33.831
here at the college station I

04:04.347 --> 04:33.831
guess you would call it the ticket counter cause 
when I stepped out There was just a whole bunch of

04:34.638 --> 04:43.090
planks, like a patio, and down at the end was a 
little small shed. It was dark. Wasn't a soul in

04:45.553 --> 04:47.196
sight. I didn't know what to do. And about that 
time, Dr. F.L. Thomas stepped out from behind

04:54.506 --> 04:58.131
that, I guess it was a ticket counter, and I that's 
was my first trip to A&M and the meetings were held

04:58.853 --> 05:11.998
over at the Y and

04:58.853 --> 05:11.998
that was before the MSC was built. What was your 
impression of A&M as a result of that visit? Well I

05:16.326 --> 05:19.512
really didn't see much of the campus then Where I 
got an impression of the campus was coming to 4-H

05:20.065 --> 05:31.224
Roundup, the state Roundup, where kids, probably 
800 or 900 back then. I think there's around 3,000

05:31.304 --> 05:34.690
or 4,000 that come now. But that's where we got to, 
usually came down on the judging team. and we got to

05:42.779 --> 06:10.221
see the animals of classes met a few people but they 
kept us real busy so we couldn't get in trouble

05:42.779 --> 06:10.221
and were people friendly did that make did you get 
any I didn't have enough yes we met mostly the

05:42.779 --> 06:10.221
faculty people like Fred Elliott that for years 
did the barbecuing for roundup and John Box and

06:11.011 --> 06:41.001
John E Hutchison Director of Extension and Floyd 
Lynch who was responsible for the 4-H programs in

06:11.011 --> 06:41.001
Texas back then but they had our activities so 
tightly scheduled that we primarily enacted with

06:11.011 --> 06:41.001
people over in Animal Science when it was judging 
and giving our reasons and that kind of thing but I

06:11.011 --> 06:41.001
really didn't know any of them until I came down 
here as a freshman In fact, I didn't realize that

06:42.719 --> 06:51.650
A&M was all military and all mail when I got here in 
the summer of 55. I figured it out. I came down here

06:54.773 --> 07:04.385
because I wasn't sure that I could pass college 
work coming out of a small high school. And I think

07:04.405 --> 07:09.030
Mom and Dad felt like that I needed to get out of 
there. so i came down on monday after i graduated

07:10.293 --> 07:31.440
high school on friday so you came you began in the 
summer yes uh what did you how did you get here

07:10.293 --> 07:31.440
describe that trip how'd you get here what'd you 
bring well i got here probably like most aggies do

07:10.293 --> 07:31.440
back then i uh packed What I needed, a couple pair of 
jeans and some underwear and a suit and a pair of

07:31.960 --> 07:55.926
tennis shoes and a pair of boots and ironing board, 
iron and a rub board to do my clothes and shaving and

07:31.960 --> 07:55.926
toothpaste and toothbrush with those in a duffel 
bag and a footlocker. Mama took me, she knew that

07:57.678 --> 08:02.665
the vet was coming down for a clinic. But she took me 
out south side of town and told me, go to A&M and

08:03.406 --> 08:10.776
don't come home. Did you hitchhike? Yes. But Mama, 
I'm sure, knew that the vet was fixing to go to a

08:15.282 --> 08:23.974
clinic down here because Curtis Thaxton, who was 
the vet there at Wellington, picked me up. And I had

08:24.535 --> 08:26.638
a room. had a job i roomed over at mall hamilton's 
right back of the campus area there at north gate

08:27.192 --> 08:52.812
and she was a mom of the i didn't know at the end but 
later on i figured it out j.w hamilton who was

08:27.192 --> 08:52.812
sheriff brazos county and i had a job in the 
entomology department just across the railroad

08:27.192 --> 08:52.812
tracks over there at the lab with neil randolph 
what did it pay 17 cents an hour Of course, I worked

08:53.872 --> 09:01.102
nights during the week at the pharmacy where 
Lupo's is now. And I can't remember, Black's was

09:01.683 --> 09:04.367
over at Eastgate. I can't remember the name of the 
pharmacy, but I jerked sodas. And then on

09:08.012 --> 09:16.585
weekends, I worked at the Phoenix Station where 
the chicken oil company is there, where Oak

09:08.012 --> 09:16.585
College and College of Maine come together. And 
you had those jobs lined up before you got here?

09:20.531 --> 09:23.575
Well, no, I got the drugstore job in the I had the 
anemology job with Neil Randolph, and I spent the

09:24.061 --> 09:33.912
whole summer shelling vetch seed. He had treated 
some plots to control vetch brookhead up at

09:33.953 --> 09:39.319
Greenville. And so you rode with the vet all the way 
down here, and describe how you enrolled in those

09:40.080 --> 09:52.414
summer classes. Well, we went on with Sabisa and 
stood in line and registered. And you'd have to go

09:57.822 --> 10:03.371
over to the tables that were labeled English or 
math. The departments had their tables. And you'd

10:06.356 --> 10:17.794
start out, if you had a major, you'd start out with a 
schedule of courses that you were approved to take

10:06.356 --> 10:17.794
or should take. Then you went to each one of the 
departments, and they figured if the class had

10:18.365 --> 10:27.293
filled up or not, what times you were going to take 
them. Of course, during summer school, there

10:27.814 --> 10:33.859
wasn't any problem in getting the classes that you 
needed to take. I took one course each semester. I

10:36.141 --> 10:41.526
took math, which was trig, and that was an advanced 
course then. And so how did you survive those

10:43.008 --> 10:45.770
courses? Pretty well? Yeah. much better than I 
really thought I would.

10:53.565 --> 11:00.734
The coursework turned out not to be that 
difficult, but I remained scared until I

10:53.565 --> 11:00.734
graduated. And so you're here all summer taking 
course and working. Did you go home at the end of

11:09.245 --> 11:10.847
summer school? No. Stayed? Too far. Too far. and I 
didn't have a car. So I just, when I came in May, the

11:16.281 --> 11:19.885
first time I went home was Christmas. Who did you, 
how did you make some friends? Mostly where I was

11:26.413 --> 11:29.397
working, out at the lab. That's where I met people 
and then at church. Where did you go to church? A&M

11:33.943 --> 11:36.626
United Methodist Church. Back then it was College 
Station Methodist Church. Describe that

11:40.871 --> 11:43.114
congregation in those years. It was made up mostly 
of faculty and students. The thing that always

11:50.311 --> 11:58.322
impressed me was the fact that nearly all of A&M's 
presidents back then were members of that church.

11:58.523 --> 11:59.023
Including? Earl Rudder, Jarvis Miller,

11:59.083 --> 12:06.794
Williams, Dr. Williams. Was Harrington? No, Dr. 
Harrington was not. Gilchrist? No. Bolton? No.

12:20.758 --> 12:28.089
And you had gone to church then at home, so this was 
not a... Did you go on Sunday nights, or was there

12:20.758 --> 12:28.089
a... There was NYF, or Wesley Foundation. And they 
served supper? Yes.

12:37.122 --> 12:38.945
I said I went. And you made some friends there. 
Yeah. Okay. then describe the beginning of the

12:43.658 --> 12:49.368
fall and the core and all of those realities?

12:52.693 --> 12:55.518
Well, it was mentally and physically demanding. 
Of course, the thing that really impressed me was

12:57.241 --> 13:04.273
the fact, in retrospect, was what it cost to go to 
school here. I believe that because I paid all of my

13:04.813 --> 13:09.902
expenses working that first summer 17 cents an 
hour and in September I got a raise I got 25 cents an

13:11.452 --> 13:40.075
hour and that was back then big money uh I think most 
of the staff made 27 cents an hour but anyway uh

13:11.452 --> 13:40.075
because being in the Corps and they furnished so 
much of your uniforms and uh tuition and books

13:11.452 --> 13:40.075
really weren't that expensive and if even at 17 
cents an hour if you worked full-time in the

13:40.645 --> 13:44.971
summer, you could pay your bills. I worked 
half-time. I worked 20 hours during the semester,

13:49.238 --> 13:55.086
fall and spring semester, but I worked full-time 
in the summers. Alright, so you were put in what

13:55.867 --> 13:58.952
outfit? B-triple-A. What was the nickname of that 
outfit? B-triple-A. They were extremely formal.

14:10.565 --> 14:16.653
Two of the four years that I was in BAAA, we won the 
General Moore Award, which was the elite outfit on

14:10.565 --> 14:16.653
campus. And it was based on academics, 
intramurals,

14:17.374 --> 14:27.206
military drill. You got points for most of the 
activities. So best all around outfit. Yes. So it

14:34.015 --> 14:35.497
was a good unit. And I got some good training and a 
lot of hazing. I didn't miss my daddy's whoopings

14:41.328 --> 14:45.373
when I got here. Where did, where were y'all 
quartered? We swapped from the Sbisa area to the

14:51.902 --> 14:56.188
Duncan area every other year. So we were in dorm 17 
when we were over in the Duncan area, the one backed

14:56.248 --> 15:02.757
by the USDA building. We were in six and eight the 
two years that we were over in the Sabisa area. So

15:13.530 --> 15:17.756
now this is the fall of, you're a freshman in the 
fall of 1955.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.502
Korean War is over. Just ending. Describe how you 
were introduced to all of the routine of the Corps

15:24.445 --> 15:31.775
and the dormitory and all that. Well it was, it was 
very formal. They all, you had the CO, and the first

15:38.669 --> 15:53.927
sergeant you had a week you got down here a week 
before everybody else did and we took some tests

15:38.669 --> 15:53.927
and I never did I don't remember whether these were 
comparable to an ACT or an SAT But one of the first

15:54.464 --> 16:02.113
things we did was go over to Sabisa and spent most of 
the whole day. I think they actually, we were over

16:02.434 --> 16:06.759
there at 8, and about 8.30 we started taking tests. 
And I don't know what those were for because I never

16:08.020 --> 16:14.068
had anybody ask me other than where I graduated. I 
don't even remember submitting grades or

16:14.108 --> 16:18.593
anything. If you had enough to pay your tuition, 
you could get an A&M. Now, there were several

16:25.413 --> 16:28.977
things that worked against you staying here. 
There were 43 in our freshman outfit, 43 freshmen.

16:39.027 --> 16:42.411
Midterm, there were 27 of us left. And I believe 
there were nine or 11 that graduated eventually,

16:44.353 --> 16:53.462
not in four years, but eventually graduated out of 
that As you look back on those numbers and those

16:54.792 --> 17:13.916
people, about how many of them fail, left, because 
academically they couldn't do the work?

17:13.936 --> 17:19.442
At that point in time, because a number of factors 
contribute to that. One is maturity. But

17:23.767 --> 17:32.979
certainly the lifestyle here was not

17:23.767 --> 17:32.979
what fit the expectations of a number of people. I 
know the freshman next door to Fish Van Zant and I,

17:32.999 --> 17:43.632
and Joe Van Zant was from Wheeler, and he and I 
roomed together as freshmen. And we had a Bill

17:43.652 --> 17:51.782
Cleland and a Fish Ryan Patterson. who came out of 
uh Bel Air and Houston both of them ex brilliant

17:52.707 --> 18:20.470
individuals Bill majored in uh modern uh foreign 
languages then it's modern language now and

17:52.707 --> 18:20.470
physics and uh he's now with I think he's retired 
but he is uh for years he's been with Princeton and

17:52.707 --> 18:20.470
does uh uh super atomic collision research spent a 
lot of time over in France and uh was just excited

18:20.939 --> 18:44.989
about coming home when the thing was up and going 
and the physics profession had invested so much in

18:20.939 --> 18:44.989
that he thought he might come home but anyway uh 
Bill and Ryan were next door and Bill graduated as

18:45.678 --> 18:51.545
valedictorian in our class in 59. Ryan, I watched 
him cry many, many nights after sophomore chewed

18:52.105 --> 19:00.375
him out. He was extremely sensitive. He went to 
Rice. He transferred after his first semester

19:04.700 --> 19:08.584
here at Rice and he was valedictorian at Rice. 
Well, what my question really is, about what

19:12.256 --> 19:14.338
portion went? About half of those flunked out. 
Okay. Several reasons, but about half of them

19:18.482 --> 19:21.465
flunked out. The other just left because of the 
hazing, and they weren't going to tolerate being

19:21.485 --> 19:30.213
treated like that, and it just, they couldn't 
handle that. It wasn't to their liking. It didn't

19:33.436 --> 19:37.700
match their personality, their expectations, so 
they left. So A&M had a way of controlling

19:42.125 --> 19:50.503
the population here, it isn't handled like it is 
today. Describe

19:50.563 --> 19:58.480
how you and your old lady got acquainted and how 
y'all Well, we knew each other in high school

19:59.033 --> 20:03.678
because we showed together. Joe was off a ranch up 
near Wheeler, and we knew each other and asked to be

20:04.099 --> 20:11.107
together. I got in B-triple-A because of a cousin 
of mine who was a senior in 55. Yeah, 55.

20:20.678 --> 20:21.379
Recommended. I didn't know anything about 
outfits or units. Most of the freshmen were just

20:25.779 --> 20:28.822
put in a unit. But if you had a request, it would be 
considered. Describe the routine that first fall

20:33.747 --> 20:40.974
in that outfit, a typical day of classes. Well, the 
thing that you had to get used to down here that I had

20:40.994 --> 20:45.878
the greatest difficulty getting used to is the 
weather. Coming from the panhandle, there's no

20:46.819 --> 20:50.843
air conditioning. And over at Ma Hamilton's, she 
had eight bedrooms, four on each side of the

20:51.312 --> 20:58.180
hallway upstairs. And there was someone in each 
bedroom. The bedroom was just a small room,

21:00.483 --> 21:15.480
probably 14 by 16 in size, had a bed in it, had a 
lavatory to wash your face in it, and had a chair and

21:00.483 --> 21:15.480
a desk. in the restroom was at the end of the hall to 
take a bath or to use a pot. But I got down here and

21:25.238 --> 21:33.849
nearly died coming out of a dry, low humidity area. 
Like I found out the temperatures weren't that

21:34.169 --> 21:39.176
high but I couldn't sleep at night. And I'd go down 
and take a cold shower come back to my room and lay

21:42.022 --> 21:46.169
down in bed wet and naked. And I could sleep until 
I'd dry off and start sweating again. And then I'd

21:49.595 --> 21:50.436
wake up. Got no sleep that first summer. You get 
used to it after a while, but it takes a while. But as

21:57.528 --> 22:06.443
a freshman, every bit of your time is very tightly 
scheduled, including study time. Everybody

22:07.520 --> 22:14.012
knows everywhere that you're supposed to be and at 
what time. Your Saturdays were, Saturday

22:15.614 --> 22:28.397
mornings we went to class, but Saturday 
afternoons we spent on the grill field working off

22:15.614 --> 22:28.397
the hours of bull ring. Go through the routine of a 
weekday. What time did you get up? What did you do at

22:33.919 --> 22:35.141
what hour? Go from getting up to going to bed.

22:41.551 --> 22:45.598
I can't remember what it's called, but the whistle 
blew about 6 o'clock in the morning. You had about

22:46.199 --> 22:54.672
20 minutes to get up, shave, get dressed, and then 
we'd fall out in front of the dorms in units. You

22:55.192 --> 23:03.344
were checked to make sure that your shoes were 
polished and all your brass was polished and that

22:55.192 --> 23:03.344
you were dressed and looked sharp. Then we marched 
to the dining hall, either Duncan or Sabisa.

23:08.752 --> 23:14.020
Freshmen of course stood at a brace and served 
everybody else. And if you were lucky, they all of

23:16.977 --> 23:45.921
the seniors and then juniors and then sophomores 
would leave and you would get what food was left on

23:16.977 --> 23:45.921
the table and you went to class and being in a 
science I had labs so most of the time I was in class

23:16.977 --> 23:45.921
from eight until five and then at five you got back 
to the dorm and we had intramurals something was

23:16.977 --> 23:45.921
going on throughout the entire school year and you 
participated in swimming or wrestling or

23:46.525 --> 24:13.782
horseshoes or washers throw or basketball or flag 
football or golf or whatever

23:46.525 --> 24:13.782
came back at lunch you fell out at 12 o'clock 
marched over to the dining hall and served the

24:14.842 --> 24:29.718
upperclassmen and then you went back to the dorm 
and always remember I always wondered what a

24:14.842 --> 24:29.718
chocolate eclair really tasted like and I had to 
wait until I was a sophomore to find out. But it was a

24:32.061 --> 24:35.204
very regimented existence. Alright then after 
supper was it always back to your room? 7 o'clock CQ

24:41.200 --> 24:44.364
lasted till 10. And you, unless you had a pass or a 
permit, you were at your desk supposedly

24:44.865 --> 24:51.954
studying. The only thing you could get up for is to 
go to the restaurant. What did you and your buddy,

24:55.178 --> 24:59.924
where did you and your buddies go to escape that? 
Let's say you had an hour in the day that was not

25:00.445 --> 25:03.729
scheduled.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.355
Where could you go hide out to? I had so many class 
hours, we would go to the MSC or we'd go to the

25:11.069 --> 25:21.826
church, the Wesley Foundation. Bob Walker told me 
that's where he discovered the Church Christ.

25:27.175 --> 25:29.419
He's a very, very active member of the Church 
Christ. One of his close friends, a roommate I

25:29.979 --> 25:37.752
think it was, took him over there and that was a 
place where the sophomores wouldn't bother him. I

25:38.339 --> 25:45.327
guess that I was just too slow and too dumb to figure 
all that out. But

25:46.589 --> 26:03.668
I was in class most of the time and I think that's 
probably the reason I didn't have, I know I always

25:46.589 --> 26:03.668
envied the business majors because they went to 
class in the morning and then they took naps in the

25:46.589 --> 26:03.668
afternoon if they could keep the sophomores out of 
the room. But I spent most of the time in class. All

26:08.427 --> 26:09.228
right. During the day. Describe some of that 
hazing that freshman year. Some of the routine.

26:17.235 --> 26:34.772
Well, every time you turned around, somebody was 
having you hit a brace and telling you to do

26:17.235 --> 26:34.772
something or you were always busy taking care of 
sophomores, juniors, and seniors, whether it was

26:17.235 --> 26:34.772
shining shoes or what have you. when you didn't do 
things well enough then you got a good harsh

26:35.461 --> 26:59.241
talking to after CQ and you'd get they'd get you in a 
room and spell out for you what you're supposed to

26:35.461 --> 26:59.241
do and how you're supposed to do it and you you had to 
be able to kind of grin inside you didn't dare grin

26:35.461 --> 26:59.241
on the outside and just let that run off because it 
was constant. All right, how often did the board

27:05.488 --> 27:08.412
get used?

27:11.435 --> 27:14.399
Probably about once a week. For what kind of evils? 
Well, at halftime you had no idea what you'd done.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.491
It was just for good bull. But it didn't take much. 
Usually though on those situations they were

27:29.663 --> 27:36.412
playing games and having fun. That was not a form of 
discipline. Mocking bull ring on Saturday

27:41.879 --> 27:46.546
afternoon was discipline. They gave you 
demerits, wrote them out, signed them, and then it

27:46.566 --> 27:55.277
worked up through the process and then you had to 
work those hours off. They'd give you demerit for

27:55.298 --> 27:59.383
not making your bed right. for failing to shine 
your shoes, for being late falling out for lunch or

28:00.190 --> 28:12.107
for a drill or for marching at the game or what have 
you. So, those were just experiences that you. And

28:15.552 --> 28:17.134
the bull ring was where? Over behind Duncan. 
Behind Duncan? Where they used to build the

28:21.781 --> 28:29.312
bonfire, where the press is now in the parking lot. 
Yeah, yeah, okay. all right um let's see uh

28:30.481 --> 28:59.374
chow hall routine um what was what was a fish duty 
what what duty did a fish have in the dining hall

28:30.481 --> 28:59.374
well you made sure that uh all the plates were full 
of course all the tables were served by uh cadets

28:30.481 --> 28:59.374
anywhere from freshmen to seniors and uh you made 
sure that the uh tea glasses, coffee. You just made

29:03.475 --> 29:06.459
sure that they had food and drink. What was your, in 
those years, what were your favorite and your

29:07.920 --> 29:14.868
unfavorite Aggie foods? Well, as a freshman, I 
would love to have tried a chocolatey Claire. But I

29:22.637 --> 29:27.403
didn't find, we complained about the food. But I 
gained weight. I came here weighing about 124

29:32.233 --> 29:40.990
pounds and at the end of my freshman year I took golf 
and weightlifting as my PE courses. Back then,

29:41.030 --> 29:44.076
that first week you had to swim back four times the 
length of the pool and if you couldn't you PE was

29:45.136 --> 30:14.586
swimming I guess the goal was make sure every Aggie 
could swim because that's what they insisted on

29:45.136 --> 30:14.586
and

29:45.136 --> 30:14.586
the least favorite probably was scrambled eggs 
because they nearly always were watery but most of

29:45.136 --> 30:14.586
the food you complain about but It was nutritious 
and it was good. I don't remember having a problem

30:17.065 --> 30:20.709
with food. Were you introduced to any new foods at 
A&M? Anything that you were not accustomed to?

30:25.934 --> 30:28.437
Yeah, chocolate eclairs. I'd never seen one. I got 
half of one one time after everybody had left, but

30:31.040 --> 30:41.130
that's what I really enjoyed as a sophomore and a 
junior and a senior was Did you and your buddies

30:41.617 --> 30:45.988
ever smuggle food back to the dormitory? Under 
your shirt? Yeah, that's the only way. You grabbed

30:50.158 --> 30:52.825
it as you left and hurried to class. That's about 
the only way that you've got food, except on

30:53.851 --> 30:57.976
weekends. We got, because a lot of the seniors and 
juniors would be gone on weekends, so that's when

30:58.036 --> 31:08.729
we got to eat at a normal pace and got actually some 
real food. Share with this machine some of the chow

31:09.410 --> 31:15.877
hall slang for foods that you remember. Of course, 
bread was dough.

31:24.614 --> 31:25.293
Ah, yes.
