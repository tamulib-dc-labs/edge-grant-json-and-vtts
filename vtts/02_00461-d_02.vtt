WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:25.465
my way on the shady side of the barracks anything 
every every object had a shape because of that

00:01.938 --> 00:25.465
right so there was a plus side to that as long as you 
could stay out of the light so that gave me a route

00:01.938 --> 00:25.465
immediately it told me exactly where i had to go i 
could only stay in the shadow even the tumbleweed

00:01.938 --> 00:25.465
had a shadow that's how bright it was and it was just 
at that break between the first and the second

00:25.732 --> 00:28.875
fence. And then the tower had a clear view of that 
distance between those two fences, which is

00:28.895 --> 00:39.724
roughly the width of this room. Now, there's an 
inner fence here. And an outer fence. And an outer

00:42.226 --> 00:43.467
fence. This is the safety line, the fiery line, the 
one that you touch. And the man on the tower is right

00:47.651 --> 00:52.575
in the middle. He looks right down that alley. I 
see. How close did you cross where the tunnel

00:55.685 --> 01:03.055
was? And as close to the nearest shadow I was, so 
that I had the shortest distance to step out of the

01:03.857 --> 01:15.353
shadow to the first fence and silence. Then I felt 
silence was the secret. If I didn't alert them, if I

01:19.098 --> 01:23.785
didn't make a sound, I would get to the first fence. 
wire, and hopefully through the second, without

01:24.693 --> 01:30.061
making a sound. But all the time you're shivering, 
you're like this. And I don't remember how I spread

01:34.928 --> 01:40.136
the things apart, because I think you just work on 
the memory. You just do it. And whether I got

01:43.381 --> 01:47.608
scratched or what, whether it was blood, it 
wouldn't have mattered. You don't feel anything.

01:49.691 --> 01:51.333
You're numb at that point. Totally numb. And once I 
got through the second fence, and I was outside,

01:54.730 --> 02:01.803
and all there was was tumbling. There was no trees, 
you know, trees you could hide. So I thought about

02:05.390 --> 02:15.729
the Indians, my good old stories from childhood, 
you know, that you cannot step on a twig or roll a

02:05.390 --> 02:15.729
rock. And just be as silent as you can and not make 
any sudden moves that were to the guard in the

02:17.073 --> 02:26.906
tower. And of course the further I got away I could 
see that although it seemed very clear like

02:28.849 --> 02:37.140
daylight after you got to be a couple hundred 
yards, then it became kind of foggy. And so if I just

02:43.053 --> 02:58.509
stayed relatively still and did move slowly, I 
felt the further I'm naturally going, the better,

02:43.053 --> 02:58.509
even though it was, like I say, bright, like a sunny 
day, full moon over here. But it is, of course, a

02:58.529 --> 03:03.735
different light than a big one. And once I got out of 
range of these camp lights, these big search

03:04.762 --> 03:18.102
lights that they had, they were always moving, you 
know. And somehow they went over me or past me. They

03:21.788 --> 03:22.990
just didn't pick me up. Unless they pick you up 
directly, you're in the dark, you know, so to

03:24.732 --> 03:30.100
speak. But they were constantly moving. And then 
after I got out of that range, I started to run.

03:41.765 --> 03:42.466
And I just ran and ran and ran. And it didn't seem 
like very long, I did get to that point. But it

03:46.972 --> 03:47.313
amounted. And lo and behold, there was a train that 
had just started up. A freight train. Just started

03:54.723 --> 03:56.385
up. But how do you get on a moving train? And which, 
which, um, thing, and which caboozer do you do? Uh,

04:09.557 --> 04:10.298
which car? Car you get on. Well, I picked this low 
car. Cold, where they transport coal. I couldn't

04:19.065 --> 04:20.987
see any coal. I didn't see anything except the 
flat, low car. And I remember it was a real

04:25.291 --> 04:27.773
struggle. to pull myself up on it, because I had no 
foothold. It's like a rock climber without a

04:31.316 --> 04:35.501
piton, or as they call these things. But, you know, 
there again, it's the adrenaline, and it says, I

04:36.081 --> 04:41.508
cannot fall, I cannot fall. I must

04:41.668 --> 04:46.173
pull myself up, no matter what. And, I mean, and I 
haven't been fairly good in gymnastics, too,

04:46.193 --> 04:55.624
which, it was a gymnastic thing, you know, we did 
that in everybody, but you pull yourself up on the

04:46.193 --> 04:55.624
rock. That's the kind of thing. And then the car was 
empty. And it was bright as daylight. Because I'm

05:06.324 --> 05:08.467
not sure I would have shown that into the car. But it 
made just a little angle in the shadow. And I sat in

05:11.211 --> 05:12.212
the shadow. I sat down. It was cold. The steel was 
cold. But it didn't matter. I was shivering and

05:15.597 --> 05:18.301
breathing. Sick to my stomach anyway. So I sat 
there. And I looked back to the camp. I could see the

05:24.470 --> 05:26.733
lights going. What seemed like a little... busier 
than before. And I heard some shouting and some

05:31.675 --> 05:35.662
dogs barking. And I wasn't sure if they got louder 
or the dogs got louder. And the train didn't move

05:39.669 --> 05:42.674
very far. It stopped. So there I sat in the car and 
the voices became louder and louder. It sounded

05:50.688 --> 05:52.772
like somebody had stopped the train. So I thought, 
okay, my goose is cooked. Somebody just got to the

06:01.891 --> 06:02.772
trainer, searching. I could hear voices and I 
could hear some dogs, but I just, you know, you have

06:02.792 --> 06:08.761
two choices. You either run or you sit tight.

06:17.696 --> 06:20.380
And it may have been a search party. They may have 
just looked into the big cars, the ones with the

06:21.119 --> 06:29.913
sliding doors, but nobody would want to climb up on 
that, that open box car, because there is no door.

06:31.075 --> 06:34.440
It takes quite a, it's quite a job to climb up and get 
over. I think maybe that's a big direct kind of car

06:35.001 --> 06:42.653
that they didn't, that they felt was necessary to. 
And you think they were searching the cars? I

06:44.395 --> 06:45.116
really thought so. I thought they stopped the 
train and had started up and stopped. And I could

06:49.638 --> 06:54.785
hear dogs and voices, people walking almost 
nearby. But there again, I'm pretty sure they

06:56.947 --> 06:59.551
were. Oh, they probably were. Yeah. And then the 
train started out. And once it started out, it

07:04.297 --> 07:05.919
rolled. It rolled all night. Next day, it just 
rolled. Desert, desert, desert. Where we flew

07:12.888 --> 07:16.793
over today, you know, it was going west. That was a 
lucky break. It went west. It went east. Too many

07:22.132 --> 07:24.515
people. Too many people to recognize. Here it was 
this big country. And when the train stopped in a

07:31.083 --> 07:38.813
small town, I did get out and went to the town. The 
streetlights were off. I remember that. It was a

07:42.177 --> 07:45.902
tree-lined town, a street. And I don't remember 
which town it was. Tucson? What's that other one on

07:52.218 --> 07:53.641
the way? It had to be on the... On the real line. 
Southern Pacific. Is it? Southern Pacific? Yeah,

08:01.859 --> 08:05.427
the 66 route to...

08:07.010 --> 08:11.474
And I paid him back for that free ride because I 
rescued the passengers. That's right. That's

08:12.115 --> 08:12.635
right. I paid him back. That was the Southern 
Pacific also? The Southern Pacific. We have to

08:16.139 --> 08:18.481
really look into this. We're trying to figure out 
what rail line it would be by looking on the map.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.449
I've looked and looked. I have some maps here. I 
mean, we can look at some of the maps. That'd be no

08:31.613 --> 08:33.555
problem. Yeah, it should be hard to locate that. 
shouldn't be hard to locate that can only be one one

08:36.490 --> 09:02.346
way there's two it goes in layers you know the 
southernmost is i think the one and

08:36.490 --> 09:02.346
and the two women i heard there was very little 
light people were some light in some houses and i

08:36.490 --> 09:02.346
walked the street and two women came out out of one 
house and they saw me and one of them pointed at me, I

09:03.271 --> 09:21.871
was

09:03.271 --> 09:21.871
maybe like 50 yards away from them, and one of them 
pointed at me and laughed and talked to the other

09:03.271 --> 09:21.871
woman and I just got scared and ran back to the 
railroad.

09:25.194 --> 09:29.599
And then when the train would stop on some of those 
desert places way out in the boonies you would see

09:31.064 --> 09:47.318
hobos get off you know people that were riding the 
train besides you but there was nobody in your car

09:31.064 --> 09:47.318
nobody and So I must have made some acquaintance 
with those people, because I just remember

09:47.872 --> 10:04.287
joining up with some of those migrant farmers.

10:04.408 --> 10:06.970
Or at least met them. But there again, my time may be 
a little off, because I remember I did want to get to

10:08.451 --> 10:16.579
a harbor to, I want to get on a boat and go to South 
America. And I do remember going all the way into

10:23.354 --> 10:32.629
the train does go pretty close to the coast along 
the beach area somewhere in there. And I worked my

10:32.649 --> 10:37.437
way to San Pedro.

10:39.863 --> 10:44.893
And I got a job in a cafe as a dishwasher, because 
people, they wanted dishwashers badly. This is in

10:44.913 --> 10:45.734
Clinton's. This is Clinton's cafeteria? No. No, 
this is in, Clinton's is in San Francisco. This is

10:50.383 --> 10:51.766
near the harbor. You could almost look at the ships 
from that little cafe. So we're talking

10:57.296 --> 11:00.302
September, October, November. Yeah, I think so. I 
remember looking and checking that out, and there

11:05.392 --> 11:24.136
was no way I could figure out how to get on the ship, 
because they had only one entrance, that little

11:05.392 --> 11:24.136
bit of stairway they have going up, and it's always 
somebody there checking you, and of course these

11:05.392 --> 11:24.136
boats are so big, there's no way you can get on them. 
I thought about climbing up on those. ropes and

11:26.168 --> 11:29.492
gave that up, kill yourself. And then what would 
you do after you're on there? What would you eat?

11:34.759 --> 11:43.550
You know, I just couldn't figure out a way to get on a 
boat and become a successful stowaway. I just

11:43.570 --> 11:45.432
couldn't figure it out. So I turned, turned 
around, ran away back to the, probably picking

11:45.452 --> 11:52.581
fruit, went into I met some families. One of the 
families, they were going to Oregon picking

11:59.907 --> 12:05.715
apples. You have to go with whatever fruit is ready 
for harvest. And I remember it was a nice family

12:10.803 --> 12:16.912
from Arkansas,

12:10.803 --> 12:16.912
Oklahoma. The old man and his wife and a daughter, a 
nice looking daughter. the right age for me. And

12:26.110 --> 12:29.094
they kind of wanted to make a little match there. 
They saw you as a potential son-in-law. Yeah,

12:32.478 --> 12:33.859
potential son-in-law. And you, you know, you're a 
source of revenue. Everybody works in the field,

12:36.863 --> 12:42.810
so that means that much more money coming in for the 
table. And they were very sweet and shared food,

12:44.131 --> 12:47.875
you know. Mexican or? No, no. Actually, Very much 
the same as you read in the Grapes of Wrath. At the

12:56.755 --> 13:01.120
same time, people were still... Just down and out 
folks. That was their way of life. They wouldn't

13:02.661 --> 13:06.285
want it any other way. That's all they knew and 
that's all they were talking about. There was

13:10.709 --> 13:17.496
still, when I later on read and saw the movie Grapes 
of Wrath, I said, that's the people I was working

13:10.709 --> 13:17.496
with. Just honest, hardworking.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.241
And they traveled as a family. Yeah, and some of 
them. Then I met one that was alone. Also, you need

13:30.629 --> 13:34.414
somebody to help you. It's easy to get work if you 
apply at a farmer and say, here, we have two hands.

13:40.121 --> 13:45.388
We have four hands, five hands, et cetera, rather 
than just showing them by yourself. It's much

13:45.488 --> 13:46.690
harder to get work. Who was your first, who do you 
think helped you? Right away, who would you? Um,

13:55.641 --> 13:58.444
nobody really. They all helped, but I wouldn't 
stay very long because I was always afraid that

13:58.464 --> 14:11.800
they were going to ask me some more questions and 
the longer I stayed with them I felt the longer more

14:12.640 --> 14:14.404
likely it was going to happen. So, I would always, 
as soon as I got a little bit of money, enough to get

14:15.887 --> 14:29.535
either on a bus or, you know, I prefer the bus to the 
train, you know, to the hobo thing. And the bus was

14:29.920 --> 14:32.404
not very expensive in those days. The Greyhound 
bus, you could probably go for $6. You could

14:34.467 --> 14:40.636
probably go from Los Angeles to San Francisco for 
$6 or $7. You left a note and just left, or you

14:40.656 --> 14:44.001
didn't? Just left. It was the safest way. I'm sure 
some people thought it was strange, but I don't

14:48.868 --> 14:53.315
know. When they read the book, they'll see. I 
remember this guy. Say more. Say more. You're

14:58.625 --> 15:26.475
probably

14:58.625 --> 15:26.475
getting

14:58.625 --> 15:26.475
hunched

14:58.625 --> 15:26.475
again. Yeah, we're probably... about Ray, you 
know? So whenever you, whatever you want to do. But

15:34.400 --> 15:47.955
one of the things I remember real quick before I 
forget it was agonizing to give myself up was when I

15:34.400 --> 15:47.955
watched television later on, I was a Perry Mason 
fan. Because you get all your legal advice. Yeah,

15:51.198 --> 15:52.360
it's free legal advice. Yeah, free legal advice. 
And he used to say in court, if it's a matter of life

15:58.683 --> 16:09.516
and that you do not take any action, you do not ask 
any questions, unless you know the answer.

16:09.536 --> 16:15.724
So there was no point in, what that meant to me was, I 
wasn't going to ask anybody, is it all right? Yes.

16:16.925 --> 16:18.827
If I asked somebody, is that all right what I'm 
doing? And he'd say, no. Where would I be? Yes. You

16:22.231 --> 16:22.572
see? So I didn't have the right. I didn't know 
anybody who had the answer. If somebody said, all

16:26.676 --> 16:30.700
you have to do is turn yourself in and you're all 
right. Yes. Maybe. But if not, it was your life that

16:32.902 --> 16:35.144
was in trouble. That was good enough, though. 
Perry Mason would advise against it. Yes, he

16:37.447 --> 16:37.967
would. Yes, he would. It's a good point. What did 
you think was going to happen if they caught you?

16:43.973 --> 16:45.754
Well, they'd probably just send me. Send me back. 
When did it become, was it ever a game, an

16:49.398 --> 16:54.002
adventure? Or was it genuine fear that you would be 
shipped back? Part of it fear, and part of it was

17:01.295 --> 17:11.171
naturally I felt like the fox and the hunter. You 
want to send me away? I said, okay, you go catch me.

17:16.560 --> 17:21.508
There have to be moments, many moments, when you 
say, how stupid these people are. I can understand

17:22.045 --> 17:24.188
that. Oh, no, no. I never felt that. I read articles 
about these other guys that said these things.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.460
Well, to me, that's dumb. They're already dumb. 
You just brought up something. Two things here

17:35.825 --> 17:43.756
that I have seen him be very upfront about, really 
get upset about. One of them is when somebody

17:43.776 --> 17:46.259
suggested he stole pants. It really made him mad. 
That he stole the pants that he used to get out of the

17:47.476 --> 17:50.663
camp. And the other was any kind of implication 
that he was trying to... Be smarter than... Be

17:50.984 --> 18:00.306
smarter, yeah, better. Yeah, that just... It 
really upsets him. Where did they accuse him of

18:04.267 --> 18:06.670
stealing pants? Some article I read. They accused 
him of stealing, and in fact, it just came back

18:08.632 --> 18:11.155
through the laundry. Sure. Well, we'll make a big 
point out of that. He stole pants from the guard. I

18:19.145 --> 18:26.594
think it's in one of those articles that you sent

18:19.145 --> 18:26.594
us the copies of. Some of the story. Well, maybe the 
guard lost his pants somewhere else. He needed to

18:29.714 --> 18:34.541
get it on a pair of pants, so he claimed that Dennis 
had stolen them. The other one said that I was

18:35.282 --> 18:38.667
reading and collecting maps. I had thorough 
knowledge of the terrain, and I think I can read a

18:38.687 --> 18:45.857
map, an American map. I can't hardly read it now. 
That's because you need your navigator. Yeah, I

18:53.168 --> 18:55.992
had to marry my navigator. No, it's just much more 
simple. Where's the nearest water fountain? It

19:02.715 --> 19:05.239
isn't on your map. You have to have a drink of water. 
You need something to eat. You have to pick some

19:09.946 --> 19:11.248
fruit. Let me just pause. Yeah, I'm just going to go 
to the bathroom for a moment. OK.

19:27.848 --> 19:30.152
We've used up a whole pan on this. Really? How many 
pans have you done already? Until I count one, two,

19:32.816 --> 19:48.202
three, four, five, six, seven,

19:32.816 --> 19:48.202
eight, nine, 10, 11, 13. Oh, here's another one, 
Harold. I can cart it. My attorney has that one.

19:55.430 --> 19:58.192
That's another thing that my niece is sending 
through the mail. It's another ID card. It's

19:59.934 --> 20:06.960
a different waterproof material. This is just a 
copy of the outside

20:08.642 --> 20:13.606
copy. It's lucky. There are so many lucky things. 
His parents were just so... And they didn't know

20:20.195 --> 20:26.885
what you were saying. No, my mother told my nieces 
that, Gare, he's not dark. He's not dark. Well, in

20:38.121 --> 20:43.148
1956 at Christmas, they saw your picture on the 
table. um

20:44.579 --> 21:10.030
and i thought my dad would want wouldn't have 
wanted me to do anything else why did he send me to

20:44.579 --> 21:10.030
school to learn english and and do all these things 
just you know to prepare he gave me a driver's

20:44.579 --> 21:10.030
license test without having a car So maybe he was 
being planned. Maybe he was somehow planned. I

21:13.969 --> 21:19.315
always felt, and he gave me knickerbockers and 
suits and stuff. What for? You know, he felt, I

21:20.737 --> 21:24.401
think he, like any father, would just want his son. 
To know all the important, all the things that one

21:24.742 --> 21:27.605
needs to survive. Yes. I really believe that. Why 
did I stop? Oh, we didn't stop. It's still going?

21:36.596 --> 21:36.796
No. Okay. So that was whenever I had twinges, you 
know, about... Why don't I go look for them? Then I

21:45.990 --> 21:49.775
would say, he wouldn't want me to do that because 
I'd only endanger myself. He goes, I didn't raise a

21:49.795 --> 21:51.257
dummy. What for? What are you doing here, you 
dummy? That's a good point. It also makes it easier

21:58.026 --> 22:04.335
for you to live on your own and not do it. Yes.

22:10.844 --> 22:21.411
Did

22:10.844 --> 22:21.411
you make any effort to alter your physical 
appearance?

22:24.817 --> 22:31.965
To

22:24.817 --> 22:31.965
dye your hair or grow a mustache? Yeah, I thought 
about it. I thought about it. Or to grow a mustache.

22:36.670 --> 22:40.234
Yeah, but in those days, everybody was clean 
shaped. And that was bothering. That was hard.

22:43.778 --> 22:47.642
Once the beard came in, I felt better. With the 
beard. Once it was fashionable. Jean liked the

22:52.187 --> 22:54.570
beard, so it was her idea. Yeah,

22:55.040 --> 23:08.575
because you can see that this picture here is very 
close to my wanted picture. What about when you

23:08.815 --> 23:15.383
were Peter Peterson? Didn't you tell me something 
about your change? That was your first name. Yeah,

23:18.326 --> 23:20.288
I took the name of Peter Peterson. because my 
barber had told me that I don't know each group.

23:24.546 --> 23:24.786
Yes. And I had a buckle, I bought a buckle in 
downtown Los Angeles, and I had Peter Petersen,

23:25.769 --> 23:34.589
right, that gave us my ID card. Oh, that's clever. I 
put Peter Petersen. That's clever. So you never

23:39.050 --> 23:41.673
changed your appearance consciously? You didn't 
dye your hair or grow mustache or something? I

23:45.718 --> 23:51.124
didn't have the money and the know-how problem.

23:51.144 --> 23:52.345
And you never told anybody? No. I felt they were 
absolutely essential. Because if you read any

23:59.453 --> 24:05.260
books in history or any other kind of book, 
Somebody always laughs. I mean, the history is,

24:08.557 --> 24:13.724
you know, you have a fight and somebody betrays 
you. Yes. Or jealousy or whatever. You've got to

24:18.952 --> 24:23.218
keep that simple, that part, I think. Thank you.

24:26.783 --> 24:29.427
No, I didn't want to talk about it. No, but I mean, 
you never told anybody about it. All these years.

24:33.978 --> 24:36.782
You know how the people are going to be astonished 
when this book is out? They're going to see you on a

24:37.182 --> 24:42.149
today's show and say, Mike, what? And the thing 
was, I was in the public eye. Yes, for the

24:46.616 --> 24:50.822
photographs of the tennis matches and the herb 
cages. International matches and celebrity

24:50.842 --> 24:59.394
matches, a lot of Hollywood people. I like the one 
about Robert Stagg. Robert Stagg, excuse me. He

25:03.998 --> 25:05.620
wanted me to come down. He asked Gina and I to come 
down and play tennis on his private court. And I was

25:09.504 --> 25:16.993
going to teach him the backhand.

25:17.013 --> 25:20.137
I wanted to go with Gina. See, she saves me. I would 
have gone, see? She saves me from my... From

25:22.800 --> 25:24.722
yourself. From myself.

25:28.407 --> 25:31.390
So she's the perfect maid for a fugitive. That 
might be a good chapter. Wait till you get on. Yeah,

25:38.183 --> 25:40.333
perfect page for the fugitive.
