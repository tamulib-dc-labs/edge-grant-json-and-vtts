00:09.616 --> 00:15.764
What's the value to a scientist to be established 
at an institution like Scripps? A value to a

00:15.784 --> 00:17.486
scientist? Right. Let me, the question's poorly 
phrased. Usually you think of a scientist working

00:21.452 --> 00:29.542
out of a very traditional department, that is, 
department of geophysics or what have you. But

00:30.023 --> 00:33.828
here there seems to be a mixture of scientists 
working in and around the ocean. Is that a

00:33.848 --> 00:36.231
particular value to a scientist doing research?

00:39.130 --> 00:56.066
Well, I think

00:39.130 --> 00:56.066
sometimes, yes, the value, I think, is from the 
sharing of information from various

00:39.130 --> 00:56.066
disciplines. So that a scientist that scripts, 
and I think this is true in general of

00:58.408 --> 01:08.378
oceanographic institution, is that the science 
is not as compartmentalize in oceanography as it

01:08.695 --> 01:29.560
might be in a more traditional university where 
you have departments of physics, chemistry,

01:08.695 --> 01:29.560
mathematics, in which a man might

01:08.695 --> 01:29.560
carry out his entire scientific career in one 
fairly narrow field. Oceanography doesn't have

01:30.081 --> 01:36.829
these sharp boundaries, and when One sees that 
right from the beginning when you go to sea and

01:37.535 --> 01:45.305
share the use of a ship with many other 
disciplines. And so that, in a sense, is an

01:46.406 --> 01:49.670
advantage. It's a broadening experience to work 
in an oceanographic institution. Now, were you

01:57.801 --> 02:01.405
the driving force behind the Operation Mid-Pack? 
I wouldn't say I was the driving force. I think The

02:07.319 --> 02:10.804
most important person in MIDPAC was Roger Bell. He 
was the leader of the expedition. I was, my

02:13.948 --> 02:22.159
function, I remember, I was chairman of what they 
called a joint planning committee. We had the, we

02:22.439 --> 02:27.666
wanted to have a two-ship expedition.

02:30.069 --> 02:36.077
That was mainly my interest because I wanted to do 
seismic refreshment work before I had a two-ship.

02:36.631 --> 02:41.175
Scripps Institution only had one ocean-going 
ship. That was the Horizon. There was a similar

02:45.059 --> 02:58.131
interest in doing oceanographic

02:45.059 --> 02:58.131
exploration, geophysical, at the Naval 
Electronics Lab. So we got together. This was

03:00.754 --> 03:04.377
largely through the efforts of Roger Revelle. and 
formed a joint expedition of the two

03:06.382 --> 03:10.646
laboratories. And my function there was to be 
chairman of a committee where we met about once a

03:11.847 --> 03:22.937
week for several months before the cruise to 
discuss what we were going to do.

03:30.343 --> 03:35.848
Was the Mid-Pac Expedition related to the later 
Nor-Pac Expedition? I don't believe so, except

03:36.655 --> 03:39.199
the name.

03:41.842 --> 03:47.310
NORPAC was an area describing an expedition 
studying the North Pacific. The MIDPAC was

03:48.291 --> 03:52.337
studying the Mid-Pacific. But I don't believe 
they were too directly related. I had nothing to do

03:55.902 --> 03:57.825
with NORPAC. What sort of information about the

04:06.372 --> 04:12.478
Well, there were a variety of projects done. It's 
hard for me to remember all of the things that were

04:13.458 --> 04:18.343
done. There were several projects studying the 
morphology of the ocean bottom through echo

04:18.363 --> 04:25.429
sounding. We were doing studies of ocean bottom 
structures through seismic refraction methods.

04:36.494 --> 04:40.741
expedition to study heat flow also. Of course, 
bottom coring was very important. The first time

04:46.430 --> 04:58.729
we used the piston core, we had a kind of a new device 
at that time developed by Kuhlenberg, a Swedish

04:46.430 --> 04:58.729
oceanographer. So we had piston cores. We had 
gravity cores. and taking samples of the

05:04.405 --> 05:12.996
seafloor, taking temperature probes, and a 
variety of things. It would be hard for me just

05:13.016 --> 05:28.557
informally like this to really summarize the 
whole thing, but in a way it was a model for many

05:13.016 --> 05:28.557
expeditions to come later on, like Capricorn and 
other expeditions. That was exactly what I was

05:29.380 --> 05:34.648
interested in, was this idea of it being a model for 
later expeditions, how it's usually

05:29.380 --> 05:34.648
characterized. What did it do in your particular 
research? What direction did it take you after

05:37.352 --> 05:39.376
mid-pack? Oh, I think it demonstrated, let's say 
it demonstrated for us for the first time that we

05:41.279 --> 05:56.282
could go out and do, use seismic refraction 
methods to let's say to learn about the structure

05:57.055 --> 06:25.324
of down to the upper mantle and so it there was quite 
a lot of new information

05:57.055 --> 06:25.324
gained in mid-pack which certainly justified us 
continuing it to other oceans other parts of the

05:57.055 --> 06:25.324
ocean to see if what we learned on MITPAC was 
typical of the ocean, and what the differences of

06:25.760 --> 06:35.513
similarities were. So in that sense, the success 
of MITPAC did stimulate work and the continuing

06:36.575 --> 06:48.711
work in my field as well as in many other fields. 
It's really like the study of... of the heat flow

06:54.228 --> 06:57.051
from the ocean bottom, for example. The initial 
results on mid-pack were very important in

06:58.072 --> 07:10.746
encouraging further work in that field.

07:10.766 --> 07:16.792
Do you enjoy the actual expeditions of 
oceanography more so than the theoretical and

07:10.766 --> 07:16.792
laboratory work? Yes, I

07:16.932 --> 07:22.378
enjoy... out at sea more than interpreting the 
data. Excuse

07:27.245 --> 07:35.037
me. Now, what do you consider your most important 
accomplishment in oceanography?

07:45.812 --> 07:46.813
Oh, gee. Oh, I guess maybe what I've done in in the 
general field of moho hunting or seismic

07:52.345 --> 08:00.515
refraction studies of ocean structure. In terms 
of the length of time I've spent in doing that and

08:01.176 --> 08:13.150
the quantity of data in the archives.

08:16.855 --> 08:21.981
Would you explain what elastic anastrophe is? 
Anisotropy. Is it anisoptery? Anisotropy.

08:26.660 --> 08:26.780
Right. Yeah, well, that's really part. Let's see, 
I guess you're referring to something which is

08:29.443 --> 08:40.937
really part of this study I'm mentioning of the 
ocean bottom structure. In that study, we measure

08:40.957 --> 08:49.487
the velocity of the waves under the ocean bottom.

08:50.648 --> 09:12.037
The objective of this work has always been mainly 
to achieve penetration through the crustal

08:50.648 --> 09:12.037
rocks, which form sort of a thin veneer over the 
bulk of the earth, to penetrate through that crust

08:50.648 --> 09:12.037
into the real earth material, the mantle. The 
great bulk of the earth is called the mantle.

09:14.701 --> 09:19.828
That's the solid exterior of the earth that's 
about 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers thick and lies

09:20.399 --> 09:29.368
above the molten core.

09:32.651 --> 09:44.443
We found that the velocity of this mantle, the 
upper part of the mantle right below the crust,

09:32.651 --> 09:44.443
that its velocity depended on direction of 
travel.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.748
And in other words, it was not isotropic. 
Isotropic means that the properties are the same

09:51.179 --> 09:58.210
regardless of what direction, but it's 
anisotropic. And a good deal of our work here in the

10:00.173 --> 10:16.680
last few years has been studying this anisotropy, 
attempting to measure it and, if possible, learn

10:00.173 --> 10:16.680
something about what causes it. Well, why did you 
hypothesize about the upper mantle of the ocean in

10:18.280 --> 10:24.305
terms of exhibiting it? Was there any clue you had 
that the upper mantle might exhibit this? The idea

10:29.650 --> 10:39.819
that it was anisotropic came not from our work, but 
from other people. The principal one here is Harry

10:39.879 --> 10:47.005
Hess, who studied anisotropy of the rocks that are 
believed to be typical of the rocks that come from

10:48.098 --> 10:56.828
the upper mantle. He was a geologist, one of his 
specialties. He was a very broad-thinking

11:02.335 --> 11:11.666
geologist, but one of his specialties was 
studying these rocks in a microscope. These were

11:11.686 --> 11:17.953
samples of rocks that came from various places 
where it was believed that they were extruded by

11:18.322 --> 11:23.770
volcanic process from deep down in the earth, and 
therefore represented . Those, when you look at

11:24.671 --> 11:42.757
them in a microscope, you can see that the grains in 
a specimen, say a small specimen of the size of a few

11:24.671 --> 11:42.757
centimeters, that the grains in that specimen are 
not oriented at random, but are lined up. And this

11:44.139 --> 11:46.422
interested him all Many years ago, he studied this 
anisotropy

11:46.823 --> 11:58.362
in the little sample. And so

11:59.905 --> 12:11.464
he was aware of this anisotropy in small samples, 
the thing that was startling about this

12:12.170 --> 12:42.109
anisotropy was that it occurred over long 
distances hundreds of thousands of miles lined up

12:12.170 --> 12:42.109
in order it wasn't surprising to anybody that 
you'd find this anisotropy in a small material

12:12.170 --> 12:42.109
because the crystals that make up the uh the type of 
material that forms the earth crest are

12:12.170 --> 12:42.109
anisotropic crystals the crystals are not don't 
have a simple cubical structure, but have a more

12:42.730 --> 12:48.676
complex structure. So both the index of 
refraction, that's the speed of light through the

12:48.696 --> 13:09.636
crystal, and the speed of sound, speed of elastic 
waves, both of these depend on the direction of

12:48.696 --> 13:09.636
propagation through the crystal. So if the 
crystals then are lined up, over a long distance,

13:13.696 --> 13:27.951
then you get an effect of velocity being in 
different directions, similar to what we observe

13:13.696 --> 13:27.951
in our seismic experiment. Well, how is this 
related to sea floor spreading?

13:34.498 --> 13:43.467
There is an experimental relation

13:44.459 --> 13:59.653
we have found is that the direction

13:44.459 --> 13:59.653
of maximum velocity is in the direction that sea 
floor was spreading at the time the rock was

13:44.459 --> 13:59.653
formed. So the obvious conclusion here is that the 
process of the rock being formed at the time the

14:00.854 --> 14:13.926
ocean bottom was spreading apart In the process of 
formation, the crystals are lined up. Now, the

14:19.708 --> 14:30.725
details of how this happened are not known, but 
there's a clue to that in the observation that the

14:19.708 --> 14:30.725
maximum direction of maximum velocity is in the 
direction of spreading.

14:33.470 --> 14:42.023
And we observed that first in the area right off 
California, where the sea is bottom that's

14:42.273 --> 14:47.021
directly west of here is formed by east-west 
spreading, roughly. It's not exactly east-west.

14:51.528 --> 14:59.540
And we've found that when we first observed this, 
that the maximum velocity was roughly east-west.

15:00.202 --> 15:05.530
And it turns out that if we compare it in detail with 
the estimated the direction of spreading. Then it

15:08.746 --> 15:33.041
agrees almost exactly at 90 degrees by making its 
first statistical study of all of the stations

15:08.746 --> 15:33.041
within the area and comparing the velocity with 
its direction with the direction of

15:08.746 --> 15:33.041
the direction that it was moving at the time it was 
formed. You understand? So this is all fairly

15:37.201 --> 15:41.127
recent, too. It's all in the process of...

15:47.457 --> 15:56.751
In fact, we have a paper in the press right now 
that's just being submitted to the Geophysical

15:47.457 --> 15:56.751
Research Letter giving the latest study of what 
I'm talking about here. So it's a fairly complex

15:58.073 --> 16:04.282
study, and it's going on now, isn't it? And all the 
answers aren't in yet. But this has been generally

16:06.563 --> 16:10.889
the continuous direction of your work the last 
several years? Yeah, anisotropy is part of it. The

16:15.236 --> 16:29.157
study of, the whole study of structure, say the 
velocity structure and how it's related to the

16:15.236 --> 16:29.157
geology of the area is continuing also. 
Anisotropy is certainly part of it. How did you as

16:33.383 --> 16:35.406
an American scientist find yourself on the 
Russian vessels, and how well did you function

16:35.858 --> 16:40.542
there? You seem to know quite a bit already. I have 
been invited to

16:46.047 --> 17:02.963
participate in some Russian oceanographic 
ships, and

16:46.047 --> 17:02.963
that's through I guess my acquaintance with 
Russian scientists initially was the reason I...

17:05.002 --> 17:23.980
Actually, it was associated with anisotropy 
because both times I went aboard a Russian ship,

17:05.002 --> 17:23.980
they were conducting experiments to measure 
anisotropy.

17:27.884 --> 17:33.169
But these were people that I knew previously 
before I really got into this field of study of

17:33.706 --> 17:41.556
anisotropy. So

17:41.736 --> 17:57.155
let's see, the field that we're in, you see, is an 
international field in which many countries

17:41.736 --> 17:57.155
participate. And the Russians are Russian 
geophysicists, oceanographers, are very active

18:03.052 --> 18:11.380
in it, very well supported by the Soviet 
government. How did you meet the Russian

18:11.400 --> 18:15.865
scientist?

18:15.885 --> 18:21.030
Well, there were two occasions where I had good 
contact. One was a meeting which took place at UCLA

18:21.050 --> 18:30.139
in 1963.

18:31.587 --> 18:35.593
to discuss the results of the International 
Geophysical Year. And this meeting was held just

18:37.676 --> 19:00.750
before the

18:37.676 --> 19:00.750
international meeting of the IUGG, 
International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics,

18:37.676 --> 19:00.750
which meets periodically every three years. 
1963, it met in Berkeley. Before that, there was a

19:04.258 --> 19:11.025
meeting at UCLA to discuss the results of the 
International Geophysical Year. The Russians

19:11.506 --> 19:14.830
sent large delegations to both meetings. It was at 
a time when Russia was opening up, sending people

19:16.031 --> 19:29.286
abroad for the first time, and a number of people 
that I knew only through scientific reputation

19:29.401 --> 19:31.623
and came to this meeting. And some of these people 
were people who were participating in this

19:33.505 --> 19:47.978
oceanographic work that I participated in at sea 
with them. But so my direct contact with them began

19:49.059 --> 19:58.547
here in 1963, and then later they had an 
International Oceanographic Congress in

19:59.135 --> 20:03.759
Moscow, 1966.

20:06.221 --> 20:20.554
And I went to that and met and made contacts again 
with some of the same people that came over here in

20:06.221 --> 20:20.554
the summer of 1963. And then

20:20.574 --> 20:27.420
from that came the suggestion that you go on this 
vessel? Well, then I was invited, actually, by

20:28.312 --> 20:47.054
Udinsev, an

20:28.312 --> 20:47.054
oceanographer at the Institute of Oceanology in 
Moscow, who was one of those that came over in 1963.

20:47.194 --> 20:49.497
I met UCLA. As a matter of fact, I invited three of 
them to come down with me to La Jolla And they

20:58.366 --> 21:06.677
visited me in my home and got to see Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. And then the three

21:07.818 --> 21:16.609
of us, the three Russians, wife and I, drove up to 
Berkeley to the meeting together. We established

21:16.689 --> 21:27.563
it was not only a good scientific contact, but a 
friendly one as well, so I remained friends. One is

21:27.897 --> 21:42.720
a man, Gleb Udintsev, who has been a leader of quite 
a number of Russian oceanographic expeditions,

21:27.897 --> 21:42.720
and he has invited me to go on two of them. Well, he's 
invited me to go on more, but two of them I was able to

21:42.740 --> 21:47.407
go on. Did you

21:47.428 --> 21:54.799
have any problem, by the way, receiving clearance 
to go on the oceanographic vessels? The Russian

21:56.298 --> 21:58.020
oceanographic vessels. Not that I... I suppose 
there may have been a problem in,

22:00.643 --> 22:12.835
let's say, a local Russian problem in issuing me 
the invitation. I don't know. I was never aware of

22:13.616 --> 22:14.918
that.

22:20.103 --> 22:21.124
Let's see, I... I think I usually receive the 
invitation through some official letter through

22:22.910 --> 22:34.425
the Academy of Sciences or through the director of 
the Institute of Oceanology or something like

22:22.910 --> 22:34.425
that. But previously, I've always had sort of an 
informal invitation if I could. Udintsev travels

22:41.234 --> 22:44.298
quite a bit. He visits. He comes here to look. For 
example, he is the Russian who is... essentially

22:52.458 --> 22:57.825
in charge of the Russian participation in the 
deep-sea drilling project. If you're aware of the

22:58.526 --> 23:01.891
deep-sea drilling project, you're aware. And 
Russia is a participant in that. They contribute a

23:04.775 --> 23:09.221
million dollars a year or something like that. I 
don't know exactly what it is. But they

23:10.983 --> 23:20.676
participate, not only as scientists that go 
aboard the Glomar Challenger on these cruises,

23:10.983 --> 23:20.676
but they also contribute money to it. This man I'm 
talking about that's my friend is the principal

23:21.432 --> 23:30.524
Russian dealing with the Russian part of 
participation in that deep-sea drilling

23:21.432 --> 23:30.524
project. So he comes here fairly frequently, not 
only being on the committee, but because he has

23:30.844 --> 23:44.642
participated in the drilling legs of the deep-sea 
drilling project. So some of these invitations I

23:45.483 --> 23:48.807
get, informally to me when he comes through and 
says he's going to have an expedition so-and-so is

23:49.006 --> 24:16.836
going to be on it would I be interested in joining it 
okay later on then I may get a letter from from the

23:49.006 --> 24:16.836
some more official letter inviting me there may be 
some problems of Russian but I was never aware of

23:49.006 --> 24:16.836
any problems did you speak Russian I don't speak 
Russian no So I do have difficulties aboard ship.

24:22.616 --> 24:44.899
However, not very serious because the Russians, 
really it's necessary for them to know English

24:22.616 --> 24:44.899
because in order for them to publish and have their 
work known abroad, which they're very anxious to

24:22.616 --> 24:44.899
do, they have to have some knowledge of English, 
not only to have their articles printed in foreign

24:45.132 --> 24:55.541
journals, but to be able to keep up with the 
literature. And in this field, it's obligatory

24:55.661 --> 25:01.486
for them to know English. So I had no trouble 
communicating with the scientific party on ship.

25:07.111 --> 25:09.313
My main problem was with the crew. The crew members 
couldn't speak English. But with the scientific

25:15.170 --> 25:19.355
part, there was no problem. Do you notice any 
particular difference in approach to science and

25:19.375 --> 25:25.442
oceanography from the point of view of the 
Russians vis-a-vis ourselves? Oh, I guess so,

25:26.983 --> 25:29.806
sure. Every nationality has some difference in 
attitudes towards things

25:30.747 --> 25:40.038
and so on. Not basically, though. I think... what 
we're doing what the Russians are doing is an

25:45.005 --> 26:09.932
international science and we may I think we have 
we're technologically ahead of the Russians in

25:45.005 --> 26:09.932
many ways we have much better computers than they 
do for example but basically it's the same we're

25:45.005 --> 26:09.932
all working the same field there's no real 
fundamental differences and And I go aboard their

26:11.043 --> 26:14.588
ship, and they're doing the same thing. They're 
towing long streamers behind the ship. They have

26:18.894 --> 26:28.588
air guns banging away, and they have 
magnetometers going, and they're shooting

26:18.894 --> 26:28.588
explosives through seismic refraction. And they 
have temperature, measuring heat flow in ocean

26:29.990 --> 26:37.962
bottom, taking cores. And with pretty impressive 
facilities, too. I mean, a lot of support, big

26:44.369 --> 26:49.475
ships, 70 people in a scientific party. So there's

26:50.716 --> 26:56.882
a lot of similarity and differences, too. Sure, 
there's bound to be differences. It's been

27:00.586 --> 27:06.292
suggested to me that possibly the oceanography 
projects in the Soviet Union are better funded

27:00.586 --> 27:06.292
than ours. Would you agree with that? Well, in some 
sense, I suppose, relative to the per capita gross

27:09.397 --> 27:22.832
national product, I'm sure it's better funded. 
Because, well, let's say they have these big ships

27:22.852 --> 27:33.544
that certainly cost a lot more money in dollars to 
operate than ours do, because they're much

27:22.852 --> 27:33.544
smaller. And they have... a large, as I say, a large 
scientific party, and so on and so on. It's very

27:43.914 --> 27:53.966
hard to compare funding in the Soviet Union with 
funding in the U.S., I think, in terms of dollars

27:43.914 --> 27:53.966
and rubles, things like that. But I think in terms 
of

27:53.986 --> 28:07.062
man-hours expended in the field relative to a per 
capita gross national product, It's more than we

28:07.818 --> 28:10.946
do, more than we do, yeah. But whether they really 
get more result, I don't think they get any more

28:10.966 --> 28:17.423
better result, probably not quite as good.
