WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:16.525
I'm sitting in the beautiful sunroom at 305 East 
Brookside in Bryan with Lannis Hope, a long-time

00:02.765 --> 00:16.525
faculty colleague. Now we're going to stop and be 
sure the machine is working. And didn't get it on

00:21.632 --> 00:23.835
there that this is October 12. Lannis, would you 
give us a brief biographical background before we

00:30.355 --> 00:34.321
chat about your years here as a member of the 
faculty and the staff. Okay, I was born out in West

00:35.002 --> 00:44.416
Texas in Motley County, a little town called 
Roaring Springs.

00:48.242 --> 00:58.658
My father was a farmer and he had worked as a cowhand 
for the Matador Ranch in that county there. But his

00:59.853 --> 01:25.236
father had a good bit of land and had come from 
southern parts of Texas and earlier his father, my

00:59.853 --> 01:25.236
grandfather, had run away from home in Tennessee 
and came to Texas and was working in the cotton

00:59.853 --> 01:25.236
field south of Dallas. at age 14, when he finally 
got married to my grandmother there in those

01:25.722 --> 01:39.098
counties south of Dallas in Waxahachie. But 
ultimately, they came out to West Texas. They were

01:41.741 --> 01:43.283
still farming out there. And I was born there in 
1921. But shortly, my father left the farm and went

01:48.950 --> 01:55.678
to work for the railroad for the rest of his life. 
And I grew up with my five brothers and sisters in

01:56.300 --> 02:10.581
the town of Slaton, Texas, just about 15 miles 
outside of Lubbock, now a bedroom community for

01:56.300 --> 02:10.581
Lubbock. And went to high school there with the 
exception of my last year in high school when I went

02:12.524 --> 02:24.822
away from home and went and lived with a 
schoolteacher in Borger, Texas. The school

02:25.493 --> 02:34.081
teacher was a sort of a mentor for me and I was his 
live-in babysitter for his family for my last

02:25.493 --> 02:34.081
year. Then I went to Texas Tech for one year and at 
the end of that year the shadows of World War II were

02:36.183 --> 02:53.458
long and so I joined the National Guard to be 
mobilized as federal troops in 1940. five years in

02:54.991 --> 03:07.567
the service, and I came out and in the process I met 
my wife, married her, went overseas for two years

02:54.991 --> 03:07.567
in the European theater. Came home and spent about 
a year in business with my father-in-law, and then

03:09.149 --> 03:20.644
decided I'd go back to college and make a school 
teacher.

03:21.991 --> 03:26.756
Went to Texas Tech at Lubbock, my hometown, 
essentially. And finished my degree and started

03:26.776 --> 03:33.063
teaching in the Lubbock public schools. But then a 
set of circumstances caused me to decide to go on to

03:33.083 --> 03:37.208
graduate school. And I went to graduate school and 
took a psychology, counseling psychology major

03:38.529 --> 03:43.895
at the University of Texas. After that, I worked 
for Baylor for 10 years as assistant dean of men.

03:52.012 --> 03:53.354
And I came to A&M in 1961. Been there ever since. 
Describe the process of you and A&M meshing. How

04:01.404 --> 04:03.687
did you know there was a vacancy? Who recruited 
you? Well, Austin Curley recruited me. Actually,

04:09.554 --> 04:13.139
he recruited me the year before I came. And I was ABD 
at Texas, and I decided I wouldn't take another job

04:13.179 --> 04:21.529
until I finished the dissertation. So the next 
year when I'd finished, the position was still

04:22.927 --> 04:30.082
open at A&M as a counselor. And

04:31.344 --> 04:36.535
so I took it the second time around. At that time, 
counselors in the Counseling Center had academic

04:38.058 --> 04:42.387
rank. And I taught one course. In the Department 
of? In the Department of Education. And then the

04:47.624 --> 04:50.868
Department of Education and Psychology. They put 
both names in there at the time. That's another

04:52.811 --> 04:53.672
story.

04:56.336 --> 05:03.606
So they made me assistant professor in education 
and a counselor in the Counseling and Testing

04:56.336 --> 05:03.606
Center. We had offices in Old Aggieland Inn. First 
two floors, I think. Which, just tell us. until

05:12.505 --> 05:21.399
west of Spiesa Dining Hall, about a five, six story 
building. The top floors were unused because they

05:21.779 --> 05:27.168
were not inhabitable. And it was the, I guess you'd 
say it was the student center before the present.

05:39.623 --> 05:42.346
at the center of Loganville in about 1952. It had 
once been a kind of an overnight hotel, had it not?

05:46.550 --> 05:49.312
It was a hotel, in every sense of the word. And many 
parents of the students I counseled would come in

05:49.452 --> 05:59.362
to see me there and say, I spent my first wedding 
night here, or whatever else like that. And they

05:59.602 --> 06:04.446
remembered it as the MSC. Describe your duties in 
that new job. I was counseling, mostly academic

06:09.863 --> 06:22.522
and vocational counseling for six, seven 
thousand male students that came to A&M at the

06:09.863 --> 06:22.522
time. There was, there were two other half-time 
counselors and a couple of people who were

06:23.483 --> 06:34.740
involved in teaching courses.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.595
The Counseling Center was charged with teaching 
what they call basic courses. These were left over

06:39.995 --> 06:42.718
from the old basic division. And they gave 
academic credit for taking a course in vocational

06:43.920 --> 06:59.418
guidance or a course in personal development or a 
course in architecture, anything introductory

06:43.920 --> 06:59.418
type of courses. So I'd end up teaching some of 
those courses and how to study and how to pass

07:06.428 --> 07:08.250
courses and stuff like that. And along with 
teaching a straight academic course over in the

07:08.991 --> 07:16.041
education department, I taught child psychology 
and adolescent psychology over there. So did you

07:16.522 --> 07:19.045
teach two courses every semester? No, one course 
every semester. One academic course, three hour,

07:21.569 --> 07:27.557
plus I would take another of the one hour basic 
courses. By and large, what were you primarily

07:29.720 --> 07:35.828
counseling these students about? Mostly career 
choice. However, because I was the only PhD level

07:40.585 --> 07:50.116
counselor, I ended up with all of the personal 
counseling cases at that time. And I was hired

07:50.897 --> 07:53.721
mostly to do that kind of thing. I also visited the 
hospital daily for the people who had breakdowns

07:54.502 --> 08:01.971
and whatever at the hospital. And I would go over 
there and check with those people who had been

08:01.991 --> 08:06.456
hospitalized every day. Describe the range of the 
kinds of, and in general, can you give any examples

08:07.465 --> 08:23.209
of some of the most typical

08:07.465 --> 08:23.209
counseling problems? Well, a lot of people came 
for careers. And their problem with careers

08:27.255 --> 08:33.625
mostly was the same ones we have today. in that they 
find themselves signed up for a career which is

08:34.313 --> 08:39.140
inappropriate to their interests. It may be 
because their sweetheart or their father or their

08:39.801 --> 08:53.601
doctor or their pastor sort of influenced them to 
choose this career, and they were having trouble

08:39.801 --> 08:53.601
changing their mind and getting out of it. And also 
about that time, research had been published

08:53.621 --> 09:04.236
which indicated that rarely were 18- and 
19-year-olds mature enough to make a final

09:04.688 --> 09:07.010
decision. So they had a perfectly sound basis for 
their indecision. And it was just a matter of

09:11.535 --> 09:15.279
getting through there. I counseled quite a few 
corps. Of course, it was all corps the first year or

09:17.962 --> 09:21.565
two I came. Everybody except transfer students 
were in corps. About 5,000, I would guess,

09:27.131 --> 09:30.334
something like that. And I was a a listening ear for 
a lot of trouble, some of them inconsequential,

09:34.372 --> 09:46.911
some of them pretty consequential, about how to 
get along in the Corps and how to get along with

09:34.372 --> 09:46.911
their buddies and what to do and what not to do and 
stuff like that. And I guess one of the really

09:48.974 --> 10:03.096
puzzlers for me was one cadet who was on the 
military scholarship and was deep into Corps

09:48.974 --> 10:03.096
activities, which involved a lot of the what was 
then called hazy, and they said, man, I want to be in

10:03.869 --> 10:12.036
the Army, but this is not what I thought the Army was 
like. And so I had to bring them around to some

10:13.278 --> 10:28.491
adjustment to the, either realizing that they 
couldn't put up with this or else they had to put up

10:13.278 --> 10:28.491
with it until they get through and the real Army 
wouldn't be like this quite. A lot of those things

10:28.872 --> 10:31.034
varied back and forth there. A lot of boy-girl 
problems. Of course, the girls weren't here, but

10:32.692 --> 10:36.118
the more girl problems were there nevertheless.

10:39.784 --> 10:41.387
You didn't mention financial problems. Didn't 
have too much to do with financial at that time. Oh,

10:45.675 --> 10:47.498
okay. We didn't have the, A&M didn't have the vast 
amount of student aid on the books at that time.

10:58.072 --> 10:58.873
that they have now. And so people came, they were 
pretty much on their own. They had to do it. There

11:02.316 --> 11:07.702
wasn't a matter of finding university funds or 
scholarship funds or stuff like that. Can you

11:09.163 --> 11:17.572
share some general anecdotes about examples of 
some unusual situations you worked on? Of course,

11:18.773 --> 11:20.034
mentioning no names. Oh, I think of one, a 
counselee I saw a half dozen times.

11:29.459 --> 11:35.045
he got out a pencil and a pad of paper and started 
sketching me. And I could see what was going on. I

11:38.368 --> 11:40.070
didn't raise an eyebrow, I just let it go. And when 
he left that day, he came to give me the picture. A

11:43.013 --> 11:44.455
pretty good likeness of me. Very good. Did he sign 
it? Yeah, he signed it, yeah. Okay. And he didn't

11:49.780 --> 11:51.642
end up to be a famous artist? No, he didn't end up to 
be a famous artist, no. What in general Did these

11:57.792 --> 12:06.945
conferences with these students lead you to any 
opinion about the Corps of Cadets' role at A&M? Oh,

12:08.447 --> 12:10.990
that's a good question. I don't think I realized 
when I took the job that the military interfaced as

12:13.554 --> 12:25.791
pervasively as it did. But I remember also one of 
the questions asked me when I was interviewing for

12:27.053 --> 12:43.554
the job, the department head asked me, he says, 
now, in your role as a reserve officer, you don't

12:27.053 --> 12:43.554
intend to wear your uniform and come to the class 
and lecture in your uniform, do you? I mean, the

12:43.574 --> 12:52.285
fact that he could ask that question even 
indicates that there was some attitude on the part

12:52.990 --> 12:57.914
of faculty that they wondered about the military 
business. But my military rank never entered into

12:57.934 --> 13:15.890
anything that I ever did with students, except to, 
as I said just a while ago, try to assure them that

12:57.934 --> 13:15.890
the real Army was really not like the Cadet Corps 
and any other military school. You go through a

13:15.910 --> 13:22.255
phase there, and then you go out into a career 
that's not exactly like that. Not that the

13:23.855 --> 13:31.883
principles they teach, duty, honor, and what have 
you like that, that's okay. I'm in favor of all of

13:32.464 --> 13:33.625
that. This doesn't interfere with that at all. 
Now, administratively, you were reporting to,

13:38.830 --> 13:47.980
where did your unit fit administratively? It 
really didn't have much of a home. Someday, when

13:54.483 --> 14:01.831
you interview Austin Curley, you can talk to him 
about where we fit in there. We were called the

14:02.892 --> 14:06.015
Counseling and Testing Center. We had been, 
shortly before I came, two or three years, it had

14:06.956 --> 14:13.023
been a whole division. Indeed, they called it a 
basic division, which is a group of college, and

14:13.323 --> 14:20.811
they had a dean. So it still had a good deal of 
academic clout, and that's the reason that all

14:21.770 --> 14:34.041
counselors had faculty rank, because of the 
holdover from the time when it was a basic

14:21.770 --> 14:34.041
division.

14:35.362 --> 14:37.144
There was no dean of instruction.

14:39.726 --> 14:47.173
I think Dean Frank Hubert sort of informally was 
our supervisor, so he was dean of arts and

14:39.726 --> 14:47.173
sciences. Y'all were not part of... the Dean of 
Students, Dean Hannigan's operation. No. Nor Mr.

14:52.936 --> 14:54.738
Heaton's. Right. We're completely separate from 
those. Did this lead you, as discussion began to

14:59.324 --> 15:18.608
break out in the early 60s about whether or not the 
Corps might be non-compulsory and women

14:59.324 --> 15:18.608
admitted, did your experiences as a counselor 
lead you to have any opinions about those matters?

15:19.938 --> 15:21.499
No, not really.

15:26.063 --> 15:39.295
I honestly can't say that I had any feeling

15:26.063 --> 15:39.295
other than I truly believed in the volunteer 
concept and the citizen army. I got that because I

15:40.576 --> 15:44.859
went into the army as a private and went through 
OCS. And having served as a private, and seen a lot

15:49.604 --> 15:57.211
of citizen soldiers and citizen officers in five 
years I was in the service. And I had seen that they

15:58.392 --> 16:06.339
were every bit as good as the academic graduates, 
in some cases better. And the fact that I just

16:07.700 --> 16:13.966
didn't believe in a huge professional army. So in 
that sense, I really believed in volunteerism,

16:14.726 --> 16:18.970
being in the cadet corps. When I was a freshman at 
Texas Tech, I was in the OTC. I immediately joined

16:22.467 --> 16:27.017
because I felt I wanted to be a part of it.

16:30.744 --> 16:32.849
So that's where I come from. I didn't think very 
much about it being compulsory or

16:33.269 --> 16:38.460
non-compulsory.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.737
I just accepted that as part of A&M and I came. It is 
and that's what I work with. Did you have, did you

16:44.500 --> 16:49.908
come to have any feeling about it being, the 
institution being all male? Yep. As a

16:52.171 --> 16:59.321
psychologist, I could not see that as useful

16:52.171 --> 16:59.321
for many reasons. But I thought co-education was 
really the proper way to have an education. Did, as

17:05.911 --> 17:09.055
you counseled with these young men, Was the corps 
and of the all-male status, were those sometimes

17:10.250 --> 17:19.638
part of their problems?

17:23.742 --> 17:34.712
The fact that this was an all-male institution, 
was that sometimes a problem, and that their girl

17:23.742 --> 17:34.712
was a long way away, and or that they didn't want to 
be in the corps? That's part of it, yes. I think, and

17:39.730 --> 17:44.815
there wasn't as much transportation in those days 
as there is now. Even in 61, not everybody had

17:44.875 --> 17:49.140
wheels like they have today. And yeah, I felt that 
that exchange was necessary for our healthy

17:50.061 --> 18:03.916
psychological growth and personal development. 
Let's talk about some of the key personalities

18:04.396 --> 18:08.961
then. uh the dean hennigan uh generalize about him 
dean hennigan came very near the same time i came as

18:09.565 --> 18:37.260
i remember that and he was a of course a west pointer 
and made points there but he thoroughly accepted

18:38.067 --> 18:39.789
A&M and all of its traditions. And even when we went 
through the transition to non-military,

18:41.331 --> 18:51.745
he was supportive all the way through. Was he 
supportive?

18:57.914 --> 19:07.146
Dean Hannigan,

18:57.914 --> 19:07.146
I didn't have too much contact with him at that time 
because he was in the position of student life. And

19:11.466 --> 19:17.693
as you see, we were academically oriented, so we 
didn't have much to do with his office at all. All

19:17.974 --> 19:21.317
right, what about a young man named Lloyd Heaton? 
Lloyd Heaton, the registrar. We didn't have any

19:24.521 --> 19:26.483
direct contact with him. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. No. 
Frank Hubert. Frank Hubert, of course, was the

19:32.150 --> 19:34.973
Dean of Arts and Sciences eventually became five 
different colleges but he was very sympathetic

19:35.645 --> 20:05.398
with us because he had been a public school man and 
he was hard as everything on us the first Christmas

19:35.645 --> 20:05.398
we were here just before Christmas the counseling 
and testing center sent out a communication to all

19:35.645 --> 20:05.398
high school counselors in the state and we were 
working pretty hard in those days we were working

19:35.645 --> 20:05.398
at 50-hour week for sure, and we did supervise, 
proofread a letter that went out to the whole

20:05.783 --> 20:12.034
house. And he said, plain geometry, P-L-A-I-N.

20:18.585 --> 20:29.243
So one of Dean Hubert's colleagues out in the 
public groups immediately contacted him. So we

20:30.083 --> 20:36.929
were on the carpet the day before Christmas, and we 
spent Christmas rewriting that and writing an

20:30.083 --> 20:36.929
apology to all high school students. And he didn't 
have any direct supervision of us, but he said, we

20:36.949 --> 20:45.537
can't afford to have this kind of image go out to the 
high school counselors of A&M. It's bad enough

20:45.557 --> 20:46.578
already. Now, I didn't know what he meant by bad 
enough already, but I was soon to learn, I think,

20:47.019 --> 20:59.550
that we didn't enjoy a good reputation among high 
school students or their parents in the state at

20:47.019 --> 20:59.550
the time. All right, the chief academic officer 
then was Wayne Hall. The graduate dean. And did you

21:08.623 --> 21:13.711
have any description you can offer about him? 
Didn't have any contact with him. Okay. That fall,

21:18.058 --> 21:27.372
first fall, they hired a dean of instruction and he 
became our boss. Who was that? And his name was,

21:29.011 --> 21:36.620
I'm blocked on it, I'll take it in just a minute. He 
was in our church down there. Bill Graff? Bill

21:40.905 --> 21:41.466
Graff. They hired him that fall and

21:41.746 --> 21:49.956
we didn't even know he was coming until we saw an 
article Eagle, Brian Eagle. Bill Graff was coming

21:53.059 --> 22:04.278
as Dean of Instruction and we were placed under him 
from then on and that ended Dean Hubert's informal

21:53.059 --> 22:04.278
supervision of us. I think that's what happened. 
Describe Dean Graff's manner or style. He was

22:09.326 --> 22:15.015
uninformed about counseling and testing and not 
be a professional military man, except for a very

22:15.704 --> 22:19.408
short while. He had a surprisingly military 
approach to most things.

22:26.517 --> 22:32.103
But he was pretty authoritarian in his approach to 
the whole campus. All right. Now, you and I then

22:32.484 --> 22:40.694
worked for the same president for close to a 
decade. Describe your impressions of Earl

22:42.015 --> 22:44.378
Rudder. Well, what I just said about Bill Graff 
using the unpleasant military aspects in his

22:47.024 --> 23:02.829
relationship with people, I'd have to say the 
exact opposite of Earl Rutter. I had a good deal of

23:02.850 --> 23:09.781
personal contact with him even before I came 
because I was in his army reserve unit. And so

23:09.801 --> 23:13.707
although he was a general and I was a captain, still 
you see and hear of him a lot for two weeks every

23:14.395 --> 23:20.540
summer when we go to camp. So I knew him slightly and 
then they appointed me to the faculty athletic

23:20.560 --> 23:31.390
council about two or three years there. And as such 
being on that with that body I had we dealt a lot with

23:32.511 --> 23:43.440
Earl and him and other other schools. So I got to 
know him there. I'll never forget. He called me

23:47.544 --> 23:52.712
down before he approved my appointment to the 
Athletic Council, which I hardly knew what it was.

23:53.594 --> 23:58.141
They only took me on there because of my expertise 
in test and measurements. And the Athletic

23:58.161 --> 24:07.436
Council was charged with developing a formula 
which would predict grade point ratio for

23:58.161 --> 24:07.436
incoming athletes. And it had to be at least 1.6. 
prediction before they could be recruited. Now is

24:12.149 --> 24:14.152
that 1.6 as we now compute it?

24:17.997 --> 24:19.899
Does that translate to 1.6 today? Yes, as it is 
today. A&M being on a three-point system, it was a

24:22.062 --> 24:25.708
.6. And so I had an interesting research project 
that lasted for two, three years there, but before

24:26.829 --> 24:37.904
he accepted me, he called me down to the office at 
the system building. He said, Landy says, what do

24:38.686 --> 24:40.569
you want to do this for? I said, well Chris 
Gronemann took me on to consult on some things and I

24:40.589 --> 24:53.609
went on a trip or two with him and if he wants me I'll 
be glad to work with him any way I can. He said, okay.

24:56.213 --> 25:02.803
So I was in, but then I was in his home several times 
in that office, the other five or six members of the

25:03.104 --> 25:08.571
Athletic Council, and we got to know him. They were 
from West Texas, of course, and they even knew

25:08.871 --> 25:14.658
Peggy's folks.

25:19.624 --> 25:23.869
Sort of casual acquaintance, knew who they were 
and stuff like that.

25:27.013 --> 25:32.419
But yeah, I have nothing with the highest respect 
for him, and he was not blood and guts kind of

25:34.306 --> 25:38.691
military man at all. Describe him physically. 
What size man was he? He was over six feet and he

25:42.034 --> 25:59.352
weighed about 215, 20 pounds and he got to be 
overweight for a while and he tried his best to play

25:42.034 --> 25:59.352
golf and he would play and Marvin Tate would try to 
get him out of the office. And invariably, he'd go

26:02.338 --> 26:09.007
over there when they had a date to play golf and 
something happened that he could not come.

26:10.949 --> 26:28.512
Literally, I was a pretty close observer of his 10 
years of service and his 10 years which undermined

26:10.949 --> 26:28.512
his health, which eventually cost him his life, 
because I could see him going down physically. And

26:29.065 --> 26:30.347
he wasn't very old either. He got through his 
retirement, he died shortly before his

26:31.248 --> 26:37.355
retirement came into force. He was 59 years old. 
One month before his 60th birthday. We all grieved

26:41.340 --> 26:43.462
because he didn't get that. Could you see his 
health declining? Oh yes, I think that was

26:46.686 --> 26:49.470
visible. Not mentally, but physically he was... 
softer and breathing hard and stuff like that.

26:56.497 --> 26:59.060
Could you tell any difference in his work 
schedule? No. He worked hard if not harder.

27:09.172 --> 27:12.315
It was pretty hard on him adjustment wise. There 
was a lot of opposition to him on the non-military

27:12.375 --> 27:18.822
and the co-ed stuff. And there was one Board of 
Regents meeting, which we were called to. And some

27:25.616 --> 27:36.668
of the regents were late getting there and they 
were all sitting around the table and the meeting

27:25.616 --> 27:36.668
was held over in the meeting room in Svisa Dining 
Hall. They didn't have a place on the campus, no

27:36.688 --> 27:42.834
rudder tower or anything like that at the time. And 
I never, of course, the Athletic Council was

27:42.854 --> 27:46.778
sitting around the back side with a room like that 
and your sort of supernumerary, but it was about

27:46.994 --> 27:53.583
the eligibility of the 1.6 rule and all that sort of 
stuff. They were there to tell them what was going

27:53.603 --> 27:57.528
on. And while we're in this informal period there, 
I'd have to say that the regents, in a good-natured

27:57.548 --> 28:11.466
way, were harassing him about for education and 
anything else. Student fees. Was this before it

28:16.393 --> 28:17.735
had happened? No, it was afterwards. Oh, 
afterwards. Afterwards. And one of the main

28:23.724 --> 28:30.854
contentions there was, why can't we raise this 
student service fee? And he didn't want to raise

28:32.296 --> 28:33.918
it. And they were harassing him. But I say good 
natured. There was a subtle undertone there, you

28:39.003 --> 28:43.027
can't tell what it was going on. But he kept his 
cool. He did not respond to their jibes and barbs at

28:48.313 --> 28:52.016
him. And by the way, one day recently

28:53.158 --> 29:02.187
I was talking to Margaret Rutter and told her of 
this incident. And she was surprised. She said,

29:04.910 --> 29:08.233
well I would have thought he had flared back at him 
and shoot him out. He probably knew who the

29:11.015 --> 29:13.158
commanding officers were. Yeah, he probably did. 
Do you have any insight you can share about the

29:15.261 --> 29:27.056
deliberations, discussion, steps toward 
non-compulsory corps, admission of women? No, I

29:27.076 --> 29:30.841
was not party to the detailed discussion. I didn't 
get in on that at all. It was a sort of a surprise to me

29:36.568 --> 29:40.954
as I look back on it and think about it now. My own 
family almost disowned me when I came here because

29:41.525 --> 29:48.094
I had two daughters and a wife who wanted to go to 
school. And they thought they could not go to

29:48.615 --> 29:51.820
school. But jobs were hard to find in those days. 
You may know about that. Do you remember, what was

29:59.170 --> 30:05.058
your first monthly salary here as you started? Do 
you remember that one? Mine was $5.50. let's see, I

30:09.453 --> 30:12.717
believe I was hired for about $8,000. So that'd be 
$750. Yeah, something like that. Mine two years

30:17.301 --> 30:20.245
earlier was $550 a month in the history 
department. But you know, Haskell, what amazed me

30:20.265 --> 30:27.312
is that position stayed open for a year. And nobody 
would take it. And it was there for me the next year

30:31.337 --> 30:34.920
when I came around and looked at it again. That says 
to me that Not many people were looking at A&M as a

30:37.448 --> 30:42.918
desirable place to come. You and I talked about 
that before. Alright, can you share some examples

30:45.482 --> 30:52.294
that you may know of of Mr. Rutter's leadership?

30:55.359 --> 31:00.368
Something that he stood up for? Don't know 
directly, except the one I observed there where he

31:01.141 --> 31:10.475
defended the students not raising their 
activities fee. That's the only one I know of right

31:11.937 --> 31:15.582
now, directly.

31:18.306 --> 31:20.449
Did you see him much around the campus? Not that 
much. I saw him a lot more because I was on this

31:22.753 --> 31:29.663
committee, more than an ordinary prof would see 
him. In athletics, as far as you know, in that era,

31:30.115 --> 31:36.173
who was calling the shots? Who was running it? The 
council and the president.
