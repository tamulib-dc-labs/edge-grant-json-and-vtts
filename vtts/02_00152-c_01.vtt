WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:06.240
I want to mention something I want to make sure I 
covered. Please do. Over the, you know, the

00:07.587 --> 00:13.320
constant thing over the 30 or so years has been 
teaching

00:13.300 --> 00:21.590
that one course and being a graduate advisor in the 
department. So a lot of interaction with

00:21.770 --> 00:25.390
undergraduate and graduate students, which I've 
enjoyed in both cases. And I've been offered, I

00:27.950 --> 00:31.530
mean, I've been asked so many times, how in the 
world do you keep teaching that same course for 30

00:31.510 --> 00:34.610
years? Well, that I don't know. I don't really have 
an answer for that, except it's different

00:41.580 --> 00:43.320
students every semester. This is my last semester 
to do it this time, and I've just as decided about

00:46.020 --> 00:48.660
doing it as I'd ever be. It kind of feels funny. You 
just can't imagine not continuing to do it, to tell

00:51.140 --> 00:53.740
you the truth. But I've continued to enjoy it. But 
I've always tried to, at least every couple of

00:56.800 --> 01:01.700
semesters, do something different about the 
course. Add something about putting, redoing

01:06.300 --> 01:10.760
audio tapes, or now I've put all the objectives on 
the web. Last semester I did that. So something to

01:16.980 --> 01:21.220
keep me a little bit current. And something also to 
use different visual aids. And never to be too

01:27.480 --> 01:30.940
rigid in the lecture. Always. Kind of let it flow 
and cover things in a different order. But in

01:36.330 --> 01:39.930
addition to that, I think in the university 
community, there's so many opportunities to, I

01:39.910 --> 01:47.090
guess, be a servant or grow yourself. And so over 
the years, I've advised student clubs. Sometimes

01:51.530 --> 01:55.810
many as four at one time, but mainly I've always had 
at least one. Advised core outfits. Served as

01:58.410 --> 02:02.330
advisor to the political forum, student group, 
shortly after that. Got to meet Gerald Ford and a

02:02.750 --> 02:09.010
few other prominent people in those years. And 
enjoyed the heck out of that. Then served a couple

02:10.990 --> 02:14.530
of years on the MSC Consulate Directorate. Had

02:14.510 --> 02:34.500
a different kind of experience. Faculty senate in

02:34.480 --> 02:43.380
the department. Said, you know, we need to have 
somebody from the department be on the faculty

02:43.540 --> 02:48.540
senate. So I get, I mean, I didn't say anything to 
anybody. I get nominated and I end up on the faculty

02:51.760 --> 02:54.160
senate. And then. Uh. Hold on a second. Hold on a 
second. So, uh, Fred Smynes over in Rainside said,

02:58.410 --> 03:01.970
well, it's a shame. We're just going to let John 
McNerney be the first speaker with no competition

03:01.950 --> 03:05.990
at all. Somebody ought to run against him. 
Wilford, you run against him. Well, I did. Well, of

03:11.320 --> 03:16.740
course, unfortunate and deservedly John, he's 
elected. But John makes me the deputy. And then of

03:18.880 --> 03:24.140
course, this greases the wheel for me to be the 
speaker of the next year. But I'm keeping all my

03:24.600 --> 03:28.080
teaching duties and all my advice all at the same 
time. But that was a, see that was an outlet, a

03:28.060 --> 03:34.540
different, and of course the speaker year was a, 
that was a tremendous experience to interact with

03:34.520 --> 03:40.320
all of the higher administrators and that kind of 
deal and it was a, it was an exciting time for the

03:40.300 --> 03:45.140
Senate trying to get established. Did the Senate, 
did the Senate come up with any recommendation

03:46.628 --> 03:52.400
that you thought was a little goofy that you still 
had as their voice to support? Well,

03:56.620 --> 04:04.680
I don't remember, the only, and this happened 
actually after my year as speaker was over, the

04:04.660 --> 04:11.080
core curriculum was being developed during that 
year, all that year. And I'm not particularly

04:11.060 --> 04:17.200
proud of it, but I ended up in the final analysis 
voting against the final adoption of the core

04:17.180 --> 04:20.590
curriculum. Not because I opposed the core 
curriculum, but because there was always in the

04:20.570 --> 04:25.870
development of it, there had been a quote, a 
technological requirement. Yeah. And I didn't

04:29.639 --> 04:31.510
anticipate it anymore. And this got washed out at 
the end and I felt so strongly about that that I

04:31.490 --> 04:38.510
ended up voting no and I didn't feel real good about 
that, but I didn't have to promote that to the

04:38.490 --> 04:44.370
Senate. I, no, I don't remember anything, I'm 
trying to remember, it had something to do with

04:44.350 --> 04:57.270
women's program or something, gosh I don't know if 
I have any notes about this or not, but Dr. Shaffer

05:03.140 --> 05:11.660
called me into his office and he was mad as a hornet, 
I mean he was off the wall for just two or three

05:11.640 --> 05:16.240
minutes. Then he calmed down and we had a good 
conversation, but I, it was, it was something

05:16.220 --> 05:23.000
about the women's program. I think something that 
Ms. Shaffer, that Dr. Shaffer was a, was a woman in

05:25.369 --> 05:33.120
charge of the women's committee program. Yeah. I 
don't, I don't remember the particulars, but I do

05:35.588 --> 05:41.880
remember Dr. Vandiver was, he was mightily upset 
when the first one in, but he calmed down, he calmed

05:41.860 --> 05:48.420
down. What do you think? But, but I did that and then 
I, I became a continuous improvement

05:49.400 --> 05:55.260
facilitator, and I've served on a... Let's stay, 
let's stay with faculty Senate just a second. What

05:58.080 --> 06:05.340
do you think the faculty's role in decision making 
for this institution ought to be? You

06:05.320 --> 06:16.800
know, I'm kind of comfortable with the, the Senate 
being in an advisory role. I, I don't, I don't, I'm

06:16.780 --> 06:21.980
not one of those that quote thinks the faculty 
needs to make all the decisions, because I don't,

06:21.960 --> 06:27.800
the faculty is just one component in the whole 
university community and the, and the university

06:27.780 --> 06:42.560
president ultimately,

06:27.780 --> 06:42.560
yeah,

06:27.780 --> 06:42.560
an organized venue by which the faculty can make 
its, to make its feelings known. Yeah. And I think

06:46.623 --> 06:58.480
on matters of academics, it's, I would hope, I 
would hope that the president,

06:58.460 --> 07:04.040
and I think all of them have, tended to support 
Senate decisions, but there have been

06:58.460 --> 07:04.040
exceptions, I guess, but. In the department, 
should there be a department head or a department

07:05.020 --> 07:18.960
chairman?

07:18.940 --> 07:24.540
For, for a department like ours with a three agency 
deal and, and responsibilities out state and in

07:24.520 --> 07:26.660
state. I think it needs to be a head. On

07:28.640 --> 09:00.870
Wednesday, whether or not they qualified or not. 
Well, I think it, I don't know, but I remember it, it

09:00.850 --> 09:07.530
worked back three or four days. Oh, so it got 
earlier and earlier. It kept getting earlier and

09:08.510 --> 09:09.531
earlier. You had to turn in senior grades. And it 
came fast. Because

09:11.510 --> 09:20.680
seniors are just, I mean, I taught a big class that 
would have 25% seniors, and I guess I did, I guess I

09:20.660 --> 09:24.680
did begin to get a little chapped about them not 
taking finals, because they would put off classes

09:24.660 --> 09:31.740
like mine for the last semester, so they didn't 
have to take my finals. Of all of those services,

09:33.290 --> 09:41.310
which ones were the most satisfying to you as you 
look back? Each one while I was doing it. I wouldn't

09:47.250 --> 09:49.270
want to pick one. I, I guess the most different, of 
course, was being speaker at the Faculty Senate

09:49.250 --> 09:53.270
for a year. Maybe that was the hideous kind of a 
deal. Get your ticket, you know. Yeah. Get your

09:58.341 --> 10:01.020
tickets to the Texas game in Austin. We won. A few 
things like that I remember very well. But,

10:05.600 --> 10:16.890
no, in the early days,

10:05.600 --> 10:16.890
being an advisor to a corps outfit, having come 
through the corps, there were a lot of good

10:16.870 --> 10:21.890
experiences associated with that. How do you feel 
about the corps as you look back on it now? What do

10:27.060 --> 10:28.081
you feel about the corps today? Much more military 
than it was then.

10:35.280 --> 10:38.550
Is it better or worse? Plus? Minus? I haven't had 
real close contact in recent years, enough to see

10:40.780 --> 10:46.800
much on the inside. I think it's been about,

10:46.780 --> 10:56.600
yeah, much, many more people, I guess you could 
say, many more people in the corps who really have

10:56.580 --> 11:01.600
a, have a kind of a pro-military posture. See, when 
I came through the corps, many of us were there

11:01.580 --> 11:08.880
because we had to be there. It was either be in the 
corps or be in Korea. The corps was preferable. So,

11:15.110 --> 11:22.130
you had a, you had a major, major influence in the 
corps of people who were, yeah, you know, we could,

11:22.110 --> 11:27.130
we could kind of tolerate the bull and that kind of 
stuff and enjoy some of it, but we never had any

11:27.110 --> 11:31.130
dream about being a military somebody. I feel like 
there's been more, I think a lot of that's been,

11:31.110 --> 11:38.730
maybe gotten rid of in recent years, but I feel like 
there's been a lot more of what I would just call

11:38.710 --> 11:47.510
really cheap stuff. During those, all those 
years, describe a typical week for you during the

11:48.615 --> 11:54.660
academic year. What, you started at Monday and did 
what and how long and so forth. Take a thorough

12:01.210 --> 12:02.231
week. How many nights were you busy and so forth? 
Well,

12:05.620 --> 12:14.440
with all of the kind of extracurricular 
activities and things I've had, there were

12:14.420 --> 12:18.440
probably, there were probably not very many 
nights when I didn't have a meeting or do something

12:18.420 --> 12:21.440
at home related to the job. I've normally, I've 
been a bicycle rider for a long time. I've

12:26.420 --> 12:30.440
normally, and I like to get here on the bicycle 
before the traffic gets too bad, and I've normally

12:30.420 --> 12:34.440
not gone home until it, it's not too bad again. So, 
I've been a bicycle rider for a long time. I've

12:36.420 --> 12:46.440
typically been at work from 7.30, 7.45 in the 
morning until 5.30 or 6 in the afternoon and

12:46.420 --> 12:48.440
usually bring lunch. We have a bridge playing 
group here, lunch, but during the school year,

12:48.420 --> 12:55.470
most of the time I've had an 8 o'clock class on 
Monday, Wednesday, Friday. So, you have to get

12:59.450 --> 13:04.720
here early to be ready to go for that, and I've had 
11.30 for many years now. 11.30 to 11.30. 12.30 to

13:06.700 --> 13:07.721
12.30 class. So, even for the bridge playing 
group, that cuts you lunch hours. Now, what was

13:11.700 --> 13:13.720
this second class? The same class. Oh, same. Two 
sections. Two sections. Two sections. Okay.

13:20.618 --> 13:20.720
Okay. And what did you tell your students that your 
office hours were for them to come by? You never had

13:25.700 --> 13:28.250
an office hour. Door was open. I always told them 
the door was open. Call me. Now it's email. You're

13:33.230 --> 13:35.250
welcome to come in any time you can catch me. That's 
what, that's what I always said. But I've never,

13:36.230 --> 13:43.250
I've never set the bridge at office hours. How 
would you compare the quality of the students now

13:43.230 --> 13:50.440
with the students when you first got here? That's a 
hard read. I suspect, I suspect the overall

13:52.760 --> 13:59.780
quality in terms of academic capability is 
better. In terms of maturity, in the sense of the

13:59.760 --> 14:06.080
student knowing who they are and what they're 
about, it's not as good now as it was then. Class

14:10.340 --> 14:15.360
attendance generally is much poorer than it was in 
those days. Students can't take nearly as heavy a

14:15.340 --> 14:23.140
load as I do it. They have, I don't know how many of 
them spend their time, but I mean, I can visualize

14:28.140 --> 14:35.190
some of the options when you see them unload all the 
things they have. I mean, there's TV. There's the

14:36.170 --> 14:37.191
internet. There's the computer. There's music. 
There's, all of them have cars. They're mobile.

14:41.007 --> 14:42.190
They leave here on weekends. So, it's,

14:42.170 --> 14:53.310
I just think there's a, there are a lot of competing 
things for students' attention. I, I don't see as

14:53.290 --> 15:01.920
much interest in learning,

14:53.290 --> 15:01.920
as a general rule. I just don't see as much interest 
in learning. And your students didn't get a

15:03.900 --> 15:08.920
degree, but I don't see much interest in learning. 
And I think that's what we need to do.

15:12.900 --> 15:13.921
I think we have to do something about that. been 
doing all these years? to make an A now compared to

15:16.900 --> 15:17.921
then? did

15:18.900 --> 15:22.294
then. Is that right? No sir. What about flunking? 
Well, many more today. Many more? Many more. What

15:28.570 --> 15:30.710
about flunking? Many more today. Many more. Many 
more. Yeah, 1 to 3 percent in the early days. It runs

15:39.180 --> 15:46.150
in the 7, 6 to 10 now. I always thought I had to have at 
least 15 percent A's in class. I mean, I felt bad if I

15:51.130 --> 15:54.150
didn't have at least 15 percent A's. And lots of 
semesters I'd have over 50 percent A's and B's. But

15:58.440 --> 15:59.461
not now. About 35 percent A's and B's now most of the 
time. It varies from semester to semester. Last

16:04.440 --> 16:10.460
summer, not this past summer, but something 
before, I had a real good class. But this past

16:10.440 --> 16:13.460
summer, terrible. Now, this fall, looks like, I 
mean, I had 142 out of 162 in class Monday. Well,

16:19.440 --> 16:22.160
that's not bad. What about women enrollment in the 
class now compared to years ago? Well, I've had

16:27.450 --> 16:30.470
some summer classes with more women than men. This 
semester, seems that my percentage of women is

16:30.450 --> 16:36.490
quite a bit lower than it's been some time. And I'm 
assuming far more urban kids now. Oh, yeah. For

16:41.541 --> 16:43.380
sure. Many internationals in the undergraduate 
course? Not many. Probably 5 percent less. I bet

16:50.020 --> 16:56.630
there are a lot more from broken homes than there 
would have been 20 years ago. I think that's the big

16:56.610 --> 16:59.040
change. I think kids are about as honest as they've 
ever been. I think the abilities they have. The

17:04.020 --> 17:06.040
abilities there. I think the maturity factor in 
terms of them feeling good about themselves.

17:13.020 --> 17:24.980
Having a well-developed

17:13.020 --> 17:24.980
ethos, code to live by. I just think many of them are 
not there. Do you have much indication of

17:28.960 --> 17:35.980
scholastic dishonesty now? No, I wouldn't say. 
That's what I say. I think they're about as honest

17:37.960 --> 17:39.980
as they've ever been. I don't see, I've had a little 
of that all along, but I don't think they're any

17:39.960 --> 17:48.360
less honest. I think, I've always said students 
tend to live up or down to your expectations in that

17:55.420 --> 17:57.011
arena. You have high expectations in terms of 
honesty. I think you generally get it. How many

18:02.180 --> 18:05.200
students do you reckon you taught in that class? I 
have a record downstairs. I don't think I made

18:07.460 --> 18:14.480
18,000, but I'm close. Between 17,500 and 18,000.

18:19.630 --> 18:28.360
All right, now I'm getting near the end.

18:28.340 --> 18:32.360
Among your departmental colleagues, to whom do 
you feel the greatest appreciation? I'm

18:32.340 --> 18:38.830
not going to ask you the negative. Which 
colleagues are you more grateful to? Well,

18:40.810 --> 18:43.080
probably Larry Wilding in terms of his ability to 
do things. Larry Wilding in terms of what a

18:43.060 --> 18:50.080
colleague has meant to me personally in my own 
professional life.

18:53.479 --> 18:57.140
I think a lot of people in the department would 
probably say that. Larry's made us all better.

18:59.300 --> 19:06.760
He's certainly been a strong plus for me in some of 
the things I've been able to experience and

19:06.740 --> 19:10.398
do. Hank Mills was somebody I always have a lot of 
respect for. He was a very different guy. We had a

19:16.980 --> 19:18.001
master's degree. Oh, he's a Texas country boy. But 
I

19:20.190 --> 19:28.160
guess in early years, I had about as close 
association with him as anybody. Some

19:28.140 --> 19:37.510
pretty good country wisdom there that he could 
impart. He could read students. He could read

19:39.490 --> 19:41.660
students. You're inferring he was a buddy? Yeah, 
kind of. Yeah. Who's been your closest buddies,

19:47.516 --> 19:52.800
friends in the department or elsewhere? You know, 
I

19:52.780 --> 20:08.340
don't think I could say that I've been, I don't 
think I've singled on anybody like that. We have a

20:09.164 --> 20:16.340
departmental bridge group that gets together 
once a month, and so I guess Larry and Gladys. Larry

20:17.446 --> 20:23.340
and Gladys are probably, by virtue of church and 
department and everything, have probably been

20:23.320 --> 20:24.341
closer to this. They were quite close to the 
Runge's during their years here. Marcia was

20:30.340 --> 20:35.680
always close to Darce Darby.

20:35.660 --> 20:40.680
And Cedric Van Buechman lives down the street, but 
I was never, you know, always like to interact with

20:40.660 --> 20:50.880
Ron and Hans, but never, I've never, I guess you'd 
have to say Larry, and yet we don't spend a lot of

20:50.860 --> 20:54.090
time together. All right. Looking up in the 
hierarchy, to whom do you think, because of what

20:55.435 --> 21:02.180
they have meant to the institution, do you feel the 
greatest gratitude at the college and at the

21:02.160 --> 21:09.180
institutional level? Who's been, who did the most 
to make A&M better, you think, at the college, or at

21:12.010 --> 21:17.830
the leadership? Well, of course, I don't have that 
whole perception. Oh. University, I'd have to say

21:22.438 --> 21:24.830
Earl Rutter. Okay. And it doesn't have to be just 
one. He was the man in the spot at the time.

21:30.810 --> 21:31.361
Anybody? In the college? be. And, you know, I don't 
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

21:38.810 --> 21:39.831
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

21:45.810 --> 21:46.831
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But

21:48.810 --> 22:09.280
I'm guessing that Patterson probably did as much 
to wake it up to what it could possibly be, and

22:09.260 --> 22:13.140
that's more hearsay than any knowledge. I've 
never done any. Very big study on that. Probably

22:18.120 --> 22:19.741
Harry Conkle. He had strengths and weaknesses, 
but I think I'd have to say Harry. Okay. Now. The

22:26.460 --> 22:31.900
department has to be Bloodworth, without a shadow 
of a doubt. That's make believe that you've been

22:31.880 --> 22:34.180
required. recruited now as the consultant to 
advise the department and the college and the

22:39.980 --> 22:44.087
institution of what it should do in the future? 
What would you advise this department to do in the

22:46.120 --> 22:48.200
future? I'm

22:48.180 --> 22:56.340
going to go at it the backward way a little bit. 
Okay. Institution.

23:01.014 --> 23:09.960
I hope we don't lose sight of what it is that I think 
makes A&M unique in terms of can-do attitude,

23:09.940 --> 23:13.878
friendliness, openness, that kind of thing. And I 
think some of those things that contribute most to

23:15.284 --> 23:18.960
making it, well, I've always said in my classes, 
you know, I've been to Wisconsin, I've been to

23:18.940 --> 23:24.960
Cornell, I've been here, I'm not about to tell you 
that Texas A&M is the best institution I've ever

23:24.940 --> 23:30.960
been associated with, but I am going to tell you 
it's unique. And I really believe it's unique. And

23:35.940 --> 23:40.120
particularly what I consider to be the best 
institution in the world. I think there are

23:40.100 --> 23:44.360
positive parts of that uniqueness I hope we don't 
lose. And I don't think those points are going to

23:44.340 --> 23:49.360
help us be top ten. I mean, I think if you get all 
wrapped up in being top ten, we can lose some things

23:49.340 --> 23:59.360
that may not contribute to just being top ten, but 
make us unique in a desirable way. So I hope as an

24:02.194 --> 24:07.680
institution we don't lose sight

24:02.194 --> 24:07.680
of that. In the department, there are obviously, 
there

24:11.930 --> 24:26.340
needs to be an ability to

24:11.930 --> 24:26.340
bring all areas along in it. Well, we're going to 
have to identify, probably to an extent we haven't

24:26.320 --> 24:30.340
done, we're going to have to identify the areas 
where we want to be top flight and where we just want

24:35.320 --> 24:40.360
to be, meet our quote, academic 
responsibilities. I don't think we can be, I don't

24:40.340 --> 24:44.360
think we can be everything to everybody. And I 
think, I think, I think at the college level, I

24:48.460 --> 24:51.480
think Ed Heiler has a, you know, that's one of the 
things I kind of fault him on. I think he, I think

24:55.460 --> 24:59.480
he's not gotten beyond us thinking we'd be 
everything to everybody. So we've not made some

24:59.460 --> 25:04.480
hard decisions there that we probably could make. 
And we probably haven't made some hard ones in the

25:04.460 --> 25:09.480
department that we need to make. The balance that 
right now, in terms of grant dollars, the biotech,

25:13.460 --> 25:17.480
genetics, molecular biology, they're swinging 
the big stick.

25:22.640 --> 25:26.660
I think there's a threat to the whole land grant 
system stemming out of this with the increased

25:26.640 --> 25:31.660
emphasis on patenting genes, on getting 
royalties that goes back into plant breeders and

25:31.640 --> 25:38.660
geneticists' pockets. That an increasing 
percentage of the support to do the research is

25:38.640 --> 25:44.660
coming from soft money, soft money sources. 
There's not, there, there tends to be not nearly in

25:50.920 --> 25:56.320
new faculty the sense of servanthood that I think 
befits people in colleges of agriculture and land

26:01.300 --> 26:07.600
grant institutions. We're losing some of that. 
And it's causing, and maybe that's the biggest

26:11.260 --> 26:15.280
challenge I see in the department, is to maintain 
that, that spirit of serving the taxpayers who

26:17.260 --> 26:24.340
make it possible for you to be here and not have such 
a high emphasis on feathering your own nest. It

26:30.320 --> 26:34.340
tends to become more materialistic as a faculty. I 
don't like that. Are there some specialties

26:36.320 --> 26:40.340
within this department's scope that you think 
ought to get emphasis?

26:46.420 --> 26:48.440
You said it can't be all things to all people. Well, 
for the major, for the major commodities in the

26:51.420 --> 26:54.810
state, grain, sorghum, corn,

26:56.790 --> 27:02.610
cotton, small grains, we need to maintain a 
continuity of expertise from the very base level

27:02.590 --> 27:13.940
to the top. Because in many cases, the market for 
the products is not sufficiently large that it's

27:16.940 --> 27:22.500
going to attract the large, seed companies. And 
they're getting bigger all the time. So they only

27:25.600 --> 27:26.621
want to do things that are, where there's a big 
market for a product. So we have to, we have to meet

27:28.600 --> 27:29.621
the niche for those commodities. We have to 
maintain expertise in, from waste disposal, to,

27:33.360 --> 27:35.380
to conservation, to, to, to,

27:37.360 --> 27:40.560
to, to, to, to, to,

27:46.100 --> 27:48.120
to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, 
to, to preservation, to, to, agricultural

28:06.300 --> 28:07.321
production to sustainability. More and more, 
There's going to be more environmental oriented,

28:10.900 --> 28:16.160
more urban concern oriented than it is has been the 
traditional field crop agriculture. But here's

28:16.140 --> 28:18.410
some boxing copying it, but I think we be terribly 
or at least if we get our. Better expertise. In the

28:24.835 --> 28:25.160
web. Got, got, got. in the broad range of soil 
science, Paul. But we can't be really expert in all

28:32.620 --> 28:37.520
those areas, and I'd say we'd probably sacrifice 
some of what would have been a traditional basic

28:37.740 --> 28:43.240
science, like soil physics or have to have people 
that are functioning more at the interface maybe

28:50.960 --> 28:58.890
between, let's say, soils and environmental 
concerns, soils ecology, environment, a little

28:59.270 --> 29:04.410
bit more emphasis on integrating that, and 
hopefully a lot more cooperation between

29:05.030 --> 29:08.990
departments. You know, the department wall is a 
terrible barrier. Now we have the faculties that

29:13.170 --> 29:16.470
are across departments. I don't know. There's no 
easy answer to that kind of thing. If we could

29:21.350 --> 29:29.410
smooth out the barriers that prevent faculty from 
interacting across departmental walls and make

29:29.390 --> 29:30.511
sure that we have a better environment, And 
faculty walls and college walls seem to be

29:30.510 --> 29:38.200
functioning better between universities than 
they can between right here on our own campus in

29:38.180 --> 29:43.160
some instances. You know, that's a big deal with 
Douglas. He's got us interacting more, but one can

29:46.440 --> 29:52.120
do it and do it in two different things. What were 
your proudest moments in all these years as a

29:52.820 --> 29:57.100
faculty member here? I

29:58.500 --> 30:05.940
guess maybe getting a note from a... student 
that's in whose life the note seems to say that

30:05.920 --> 30:17.380
you've had a very positive impact on them. Because 
I know how many people think they're going to have a

30:18.190 --> 30:22.670
note like that and never do. And how many times I've 
thought about doing something like that and

30:24.440 --> 30:28.020
didn't do it. So when I... I think that would be my 
proudest moment, is to get those favorable

30:34.740 --> 30:38.760
comments from... and they're not a whole lot of 
them, but when you do get them. Question.

30:49.038 --> 30:54.600
Summarize what you have in your heart about what 
it's meant to you to be a faculty member here. Well,

30:54.580 --> 31:01.680
I feel just extremely fortunate and blessed. I 
mean, I couldn't have done what I love to do and got

31:01.660 --> 31:05.770
paid for it. Family's had a good living. It's 
been... I've felt that I've had wonderful

31:09.957 --> 31:12.880
support, a lot of opportunities, turned around 
with literally thousands, thousands of students

31:14.840 --> 31:22.270
at both graduate and undergraduate levels.
