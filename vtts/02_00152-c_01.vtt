00:02.714 --> 00:06.299
I just want to mention something I want to make sure I covered.

00:06.339 --> 00:06.900
Please do.

00:07.561 --> 00:21.782
Over the, you know, the constant thing over the 30 or so years has been teaching that one course and being a graduate advisor in the department.

00:21.802 --> 00:27.992
So a lot of interaction with undergraduate and graduate students, which I've enjoyed in both cases.

00:28.072 --> 00:31.557
And I've been offered, I mean, I've been asked so many times,

00:31.874 --> 00:34.637
How in the world do you keep teaching that same course for 30 years?

00:36.078 --> 00:38.361
Well, that I don't know.

00:39.862 --> 00:43.706
Don't really have an answer for that, except it's different students here a semester.

00:44.107 --> 00:49.532
This is my last semester to do it this time, and I'm just as decided about it as I'd ever be.

00:49.973 --> 00:50.814
Kind of feels funny.

00:51.174 --> 00:55.519
I just can't imagine not continuing to do it, to tell you the truth.

00:55.539 --> 00:56.760
But I've continued to enjoy it.

00:56.860 --> 00:58.742
But I've always tried to,

00:59.228 --> 01:06.559
at least every couple of semesters, do something different about the course.

01:07.401 --> 01:14.171
Add something about redoing audio tapes, or now I put all the objectives on the web.

01:14.512 --> 01:15.914
Last semester I did that.

01:17.536 --> 01:26.991
So something to keep me a little bit current, and something also to use different visual aids,

01:27.494 --> 01:30.999
And never to be too rigid in the lecture.

01:31.019 --> 01:34.604
I always kind of let it flow and cover things in different order.

01:36.366 --> 01:48.803
But in addition to that, I think in the university community, there's so many opportunities to, I guess, be a servant or grow yourself.

01:48.823 --> 01:51.567
And so over the years, I've advised student clubs.

01:51.587 --> 01:55.813
Sometimes many as four at one time, but mainly I've always had at least one.

01:56.300 --> 02:03.494
advised corps outfits, served as advisor to the political forum, a student group shortly after he came here.

02:04.095 --> 02:11.089
Got to meet Gerald Ford and a few other prominent people in those years and enjoyed the heck out of that.

02:11.329 --> 02:14.496
Then served a couple of years on the MSC consul and directory.

02:14.636 --> 02:15.237
That's a different...

02:34.252 --> 02:39.161
Faculty Senate had no intent.

02:41.105 --> 02:49.280
People said, and the department said, we need, you know, we need to have somebody from the department be on the Faculty Senate.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.805
So I get, I mean, I didn't say anything to anybody.

02:51.825 --> 02:55.652
I get nominated, and I end up on the Faculty Senate, and then...

02:57.556 --> 03:01.924
Oh, Fred Smines over in Rain Science said, well, it's a shame.

03:01.985 --> 03:05.932
We're just going to let John McNairman be the first speaker with no competition at all.

03:06.012 --> 03:07.395
Somebody ought to run against him.

03:08.217 --> 03:11.042
Milford, you run against him.

03:11.062 --> 03:11.383
Well, I did.

03:11.403 --> 03:17.294
Well, of course, and fortunate, deservedly, John, he's elected.

03:17.314 --> 03:19.378
But John makes me the deputy and then...

03:19.645 --> 03:24.077
Of course this greases a pill for me to be the speaker the next year.

03:24.618 --> 03:28.068
But I'm keeping all my teaching duties and all my advice all at the same time.

03:29.010 --> 03:35.207
But that was a, see that was an outlet of different, and of course the speaker year was a,

03:35.660 --> 03:41.907
I was a tremendous experience to interact with all of the higher administrators and that kind of deal.

03:42.307 --> 03:46.772
And it was an exciting time for the Senate trying to get established.

03:47.673 --> 03:56.843
Did the Senate come up with any recommendation that you thought was a little goofy that you still had as their voice to support?

03:59.746 --> 04:00.727
No, I don't remember.

04:00.767 --> 04:05.532
And this happened actually after my year of speaker was over.

04:05.849 --> 04:10.015
the core curriculum was being developed during that year, all that year.

04:10.896 --> 04:18.928
And I'm not particularly proud of it, but I ended up in the final analysis voting against the final adoption of the core curriculum.

04:20.371 --> 04:31.387
Not because I opposed the core curriculum, but because there was always in the development of it, there'd been, I quote, a technological requirement anticipated in it.

04:31.407 --> 04:32.869
And this got washed out

04:33.052 --> 04:44.023
at the end, and I felt so strongly about that that I ended up voting no, and I didn't feel real good about that, but I didn't have to promote that to the Senate.

04:44.463 --> 04:47.066
No, I don't remember anything.

04:47.126 --> 04:58.637
I'm trying to remember it had something to do with women's program or something.

04:59.984 --> 05:09.493
Gosh, I don't know if I have any notes about this or not, but Dr. Vandenberg called me into his office, and he was mad as a hornet.

05:09.513 --> 05:15.059
I mean, he was off the wall for just two or three minutes.

05:16.080 --> 05:25.369
Then he calmed down, and we had a good conversation, but I, it was something about the women's program.

05:25.389 --> 05:27.251
I think something that Ms.

05:27.271 --> 05:29.653
Shaffer, Dr. Shaffer was,

05:30.832 --> 05:34.516
Was the woman in charge of the women's committee program?

05:35.577 --> 05:40.121
I don't remember the particulars, but I do remember Dr. Vanderbilt.

05:40.462 --> 05:47.649
He was mightily upset when he first went in, but he calmed down.

05:47.669 --> 05:48.249
He calmed down.

05:48.269 --> 05:49.290
What do you think?

05:49.571 --> 05:54.736
But I did that, and then I became a continuous improvement facilitator.

05:54.756 --> 05:57.959
Let's stay with faculty senate just a second.

05:57.979 --> 06:00.822
What do you think the faculty's role

06:01.898 --> 06:05.164
in decision making for this institution ought to be?

06:11.576 --> 06:18.068
You know, I'm kind of comfortable with the Senate being in an advisory role.

06:18.267 --> 06:44.798
I'm not one of those that, quote, thinks the faculty needs to make all the decisions, because the faculty is just one component in the whole university community, and the university president ultimately, yeah, an organized venue by which the faculty can make its...

06:44.997 --> 06:46.719
to make its feelings known.

06:46.819 --> 07:02.140
And I think on matters of academics, it's, I would hope, I would hope that the president, and I think all of them have tended to support Senate decisions.

07:02.740 --> 07:04.983
There have been exceptions, I guess, but.

07:05.003 --> 07:13.655
In the department, should there be a department head or a department chairman?

07:13.675 --> 07:13.755
Hmm.

07:16.317 --> 07:28.200
Well, for an apartment like ours with a three agency deal and responsibilities out state and in state, I think it needs to be ahead.

08:55.643 --> 09:18.462
through wednesday whether or not they qualified or not well i think it i don't know but i remember it worked back three or four days oh so it got earlier in there kept getting earlier and earlier you had to turn in senior grades and it came farce because seniors were just i mean i taught a bit classic would have a

09:19.268 --> 09:32.568
25% seniors, and I guess I did begin to get a little chapped about not taking finals because they would put off classes like mine for the last semester, so they didn't have to take my final.

09:33.790 --> 09:41.241
Of all of those services, which ones were the most satisfying to you as you look back?

09:43.645 --> 09:47.651
Each one while I was doing it.

09:47.671 --> 09:48.432
I wouldn't want to pick one.

09:48.698 --> 09:55.347
I guess the most different, of course, was being speaker of the faculty senate for you.

09:55.367 --> 09:58.310
Maybe that was the headiest kind of thing, you know.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.074
Get you tickets to the Texas game and all.

10:01.194 --> 10:07.322
A few things like that I remember very well.

10:07.342 --> 10:18.216
But no, in the early days, being an advisor to a corps outfit, having come through the corps,

10:18.635 --> 10:21.719
There were a lot of good experiences associated with that.

10:22.640 --> 10:27.506
How do you feel about the Corps as you look back on it now?

10:27.566 --> 10:29.068
What do you feel about the Corps today?

10:30.169 --> 10:32.071
Much more military than it was then.

10:35.456 --> 10:39.681
Is it better, worse, plus, minus?

10:41.082 --> 10:46.549
Haven't had real close contact in recent years, enough to see much on the inside.

10:47.322 --> 11:02.867
I think it's been, yeah, many more people, I guess you could say, many more people in the Corps who really have a kind of a pro-military posture.

11:04.129 --> 11:07.815
See, when I came through the Corps, many of us were there because we had to be there.

11:08.517 --> 11:10.680
It was either be in the Corps or be in Korea.

11:10.998 --> 11:13.101
The Corps was preferable.

11:14.883 --> 11:31.505
So you had a major, major influence in the Corps of people who were, yeah, we could kind of tolerate the bull and that kind of stuff and enjoy some of it, but we never had any dream about being a military somebody.

11:33.148 --> 11:34.930
I feel like there's been more

11:36.496 --> 11:45.826
And I think a lot of that's been, maybe gotten rid of in recent years, but I feel like there's been a lot more, what I would just call, really cheap stuff to go on.

11:48.609 --> 11:55.077
During all those years, describe a typical week for you during the academic year.

11:57.239 --> 12:00.863
You started at Monday and did what, and how long, and so forth.

12:00.883 --> 12:01.764
Take through a week.

12:03.206 --> 12:05.288
How many nights were you busy and so forth?

12:06.365 --> 12:20.884
Well, with all of the kind of extracurricular activities and things I've had, there's probably not very many nights when I didn't have a meeting or do something at home related to a job.

12:21.925 --> 12:25.449
I've normally, I've been a bicycle rider for a long time.

12:26.491 --> 12:34.421
I've normally, and I like to get here on a bicycle before the traffic gets too bad and I've normally not gone home until it's not too bad again.

12:35.402 --> 12:36.203
So,

12:37.195 --> 12:48.472
I've typically been at work from 7.30, 7.45 in the morning until 5.30 or 6 in the afternoon and usually bring lunch.

12:48.692 --> 12:52.177
We have a bridge playing group here, lunch.

12:52.237 --> 12:58.967
But during the school year, most of the time, I had an 8 o'clock class on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

13:00.145 --> 13:12.262
and so you have to get here early to be ready to go for that, and I've had 11.30 for many years now, 11.30 to 12.20 class, so even for the Brady playing group, that cuts you lots of hours a little.

13:12.282 --> 13:13.664
And what was this second class?

13:14.265 --> 13:15.066
The same class.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.268
Oh, same, two sections.

13:16.368 --> 13:17.089
Two sections, okay.

13:17.109 --> 13:19.232
Two sections, same class.

13:19.993 --> 13:25.421
And what did you tell your students that your office hours were for them to come by?

13:25.702 --> 13:27.765
Never had office hours.

13:27.785 --> 13:28.466
The door was open.

13:28.486 --> 13:29.427
I always told them the door was open.

13:30.048 --> 13:31.810
call me, now it's email.

13:32.830 --> 13:35.673
You're welcome to come in any time you can catch me.

13:35.893 --> 13:37.094
That's what I always said.

13:38.095 --> 13:42.759
But I've never set rigid off the hours.

13:43.660 --> 13:50.245
How would you compare the quality of the students now with the students when you first got here?

13:51.606 --> 13:53.948
That's a hard read.

13:54.229 --> 13:59.413
I suspect the overall quality in terms of academic capability is better.

14:00.372 --> 14:10.482
in terms of maturity in the sense of the student knowing who they are and what they're about is not as good now as it was.

14:10.502 --> 14:14.446
Class attendance generally is much poorer than it was in those days.

14:15.507 --> 14:23.255
Students can't take nearly as heavy a load as I do it.

14:23.275 --> 14:29.822
They have, I don't know how many of them spend their time, but I mean I can visualize some of the options.

14:30.477 --> 14:35.141
when you see them unload all the things they have.

14:35.161 --> 14:45.231
I mean, there's TV, there's the internet, there's music, all of them have cars, they're mobile, they leave here on weekends.

14:46.192 --> 14:52.598
I just think there are a lot of competing things for students' attention.

14:53.659 --> 15:00.045
I don't see as much interest in learning.

15:01.004 --> 15:04.569
As a general rule, I just don't see as much interest in learning.

15:04.589 --> 15:08.435
I just didn't get a degree, but I don't see much interest in learning.

15:08.455 --> 15:18.931
In that course that you've been doing all these years, do you think you, how does your grading system now, in other words, what does it take to make an A now compared to then?

15:21.895 --> 15:23.658
I'd like to tell you it hasn't changed much.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.303
But not nearly as many make A's now.

15:27.403 --> 15:27.964
Is that right?

15:28.064 --> 15:28.585
No, sir.

15:29.647 --> 15:30.488
What about flunking?

15:31.244 --> 15:57.505
many more today many more many more yeah one to three percent in the early days it runs uh in the seven six to ten now i always thought i had to have at least fifteen percent a's in class i mean i felt bad if i didn't have at least fifteen percent a's and lots of semesters i'd have over fifty percent a's and b's

15:58.548 --> 16:02.194
About 35% of A's and B's now, most of the time.

16:02.214 --> 16:04.698
It varies from semester to semester.

16:04.738 --> 16:12.810
Last summer, not this past summer, but summer before, had a real good class, but this past summer, terrible.

16:13.311 --> 16:19.601
Now, this fall, looks like, I mean, I had 142, I had 162 in class Monday.

16:19.621 --> 16:21.904
Well, that's not bad.

16:22.365 --> 16:26.091
What about women enrollment in the class now compared to years ago?

16:27.337 --> 16:30.060
I've had some summer classes with more women than men.

16:31.161 --> 16:37.126
This semester seems that my percentage of women is quite a bit lower than it's been some time.

16:37.867 --> 16:40.550
And I'm assuming far more urban kids now.

16:40.570 --> 16:42.472
Oh yeah, for sure, for sure.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.314
Many internationals in the undergraduate course?

16:45.354 --> 16:51.941
Not many, not many, probably 5% less.

16:51.961 --> 16:56.365
I bet there are a lot more from broken homes than there would have been 20 years ago.

16:57.610 --> 16:59.153
I think that's the big change.

16:59.213 --> 17:01.457
I think kids are about as honest as there have been.

17:02.719 --> 17:05.263
I think the ability's there.

17:06.365 --> 17:18.066
I think the maturity factor in terms of them feeling good about themselves, having a well-developed

17:20.341 --> 17:24.006
Ethel's code to live by.

17:24.467 --> 17:27.811
I just think many of them are not there.

17:28.933 --> 17:35.381
Do you have much indication of scholastic dishonesty now?

17:35.642 --> 17:36.683
No, I wouldn't say.

17:37.064 --> 17:37.744
That's what I say.

17:37.825 --> 17:39.707
I think they're about as honest as there have been.

17:39.987 --> 17:41.149
I don't see.

17:41.670 --> 17:48.559
I've had a little of that all along, but I don't think they're any less honest.

17:49.636 --> 17:57.044
I think I've always said students tend to live up or down to your expectations in that arena.

17:57.065 --> 17:59.828
You have high expectations of them in terms of honesty.

17:59.868 --> 18:02.491
I think you generally get it.

18:02.511 --> 18:04.893
How many students do you reckon you taught in that class?

18:07.777 --> 18:09.078
I have a record downstairs.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.924
I don't think I made 18,000, but I'm close.

18:13.944 --> 18:16.707
Between 17,500 and 18,000.

18:18.475 --> 18:22.660
All right, now I'm getting near the end.

18:27.165 --> 18:32.370
Among your departmental colleagues, to whom do you feel the greatest appreciation?

18:35.374 --> 18:37.496
I'm not gonna ask you the negative.

18:39.058 --> 18:41.040
Which colleagues are you more grateful to?

18:42.117 --> 18:53.431
Well, probably Larry Wilding in terms of what a colleague has meant to me personally in my own professional life.

18:53.451 --> 18:56.094
I think a lot of people in the department would probably say that.

18:56.234 --> 18:59.237
Larry's made us all better.

18:59.378 --> 19:05.225
He's certainly been a strong plus for me in some of the things I've been able to experience and do.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.432
Hank Mills was a

19:11.885 --> 19:14.449
Somebody I always have a lot of respect for.

19:14.689 --> 19:17.013
He was a very different guy.

19:17.674 --> 19:18.996
Only had a master's degree.

19:20.098 --> 19:21.760
Old East Texas country boy.

19:22.201 --> 19:30.534
But I guess in the early years I had about as close association with him as anybody.

19:33.178 --> 19:37.985
Some pretty good country wisdom there that he could impart.

19:38.005 --> 19:39.107
He could read students.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.606
You're inferring he was a buddy?

19:45.148 --> 19:47.472
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

19:47.492 --> 19:55.345
Who's been your closest buddies, friends, in the department or elsewhere on the campus?

19:58.249 --> 20:05.601
You know, I don't think I could say that I've been, I don't think I've,

20:06.408 --> 20:08.991
single on anybody like that.

20:09.131 --> 20:16.860
We have a departmental bridge group, gets together once a month, and so I guess you, Larry, Larry and Gladys.

20:16.880 --> 20:25.489
So Larry and Gladys are probably, by virtue of church and department and everything, they've probably been closer to them.

20:25.549 --> 20:28.332
They were quite close to the Runge's during their years here.

20:30.495 --> 20:34.339
Marcia was always close to Doris Darby.

20:35.585 --> 20:54.748
And the Sigrid Van Butten lives down the street, but I was never, you know, always liked to interact with Ron and Hans, but never, I've never, I guess you'd have to say Larry, and yet we don't spend a lot of time together.

20:55.168 --> 20:59.213
All right, looking up in the hierarchy,

20:59.581 --> 21:12.504
to whom do you think, because of what they have meant to the institution, do you feel the greatest gratitude at the college and at the institution level?

21:12.565 --> 21:17.033
Who did the most to make A&M better, you think, at the college?

21:17.534 --> 21:21.100
Well, of course, I don't have that whole perception.

21:21.401 --> 21:23.344
At the university, I'd have to say,

21:23.797 --> 21:24.858
Okay.

21:24.879 --> 21:28.223
And it doesn't have to be just one, are they?

21:28.363 --> 21:30.887
He was the man in the spot at the time.

21:31.047 --> 21:40.881
I mean, obviously his service here preceded me, but I think he probably considered where A&M was when it came or where it was going when he left.

21:40.921 --> 21:46.469
He probably had the most profound influence on anybody that I could think of.

21:46.769 --> 21:47.550
In the college?

21:47.610 --> 21:49.433
Mm-hmm.

21:56.450 --> 22:12.487
I'm guessing that Patterson probably did as much to wake it up to what it could possibly be, and that's more hearsay than any knowledge.

22:12.567 --> 22:18.433
I've never done any very big study on that.

22:18.693 --> 22:19.894
Probably Harry Conkle.

22:22.317 --> 22:24.499
He had strengths and weaknesses, but I think

22:24.850 --> 22:28.495
I think I'd have to say here.

22:28.515 --> 22:32.420
The department has to be Bloodworth without a shadow of a doubt.

22:32.440 --> 22:44.036
Let's make believe that you've been recruited now as the consultant to advise the department and the college and the institution of what it should do in the future.

22:45.077 --> 22:48.141
What would you advise this department to do in the future?

22:53.183 --> 22:56.689
I'm going to go at it the backward way a little bit.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.470
Institution.

23:00.976 --> 23:13.877
I hope we don't lose sight of what it is that I think makes A&M unique in terms of can-do attitude, friendliness, openness, that kind of thing.

23:15.260 --> 23:19.647
And I think some of those things that contribute most to making it what

23:20.639 --> 23:25.187
I've always said in my classes, you know, I've been to Wisconsin, I've been to Cornell, I've been here.

23:25.868 --> 23:33.982
I'm not about to tell you that Texas A&M's the best institution I've ever been associated with, but I am going to tell you it's unique.

23:34.002 --> 23:37.849
And I really believe it's unique.

23:37.869 --> 23:43.018
And particularly what I consider the positive parts of that uniqueness I hope we don't lose.

23:44.197 --> 23:48.483
And I don't think those points are gonna help us be top 10.

23:49.024 --> 23:53.330
I mean, I think if you get all wrapped up in being top 10, we can lose.

23:53.350 --> 24:02.162
We can lose some things that may not contribute to us being top 10, but make us unique in a desirable way.

24:02.182 --> 24:06.007
So I hope as an institution we don't lose sight of that.

24:07.489 --> 24:11.875
In a department, there obviously,

24:13.627 --> 24:38.841
there needs to be an ability to to bring all areas along in it well we're going to have to identify it probably to an extent we haven't done we're going to have to identify the areas where we want to be top flight and where we just want to be meet our

24:39.192 --> 24:44.259
quote, academic responsibilities, I don't think we can be, I don't think we can be everything to everybody.

24:45.501 --> 24:54.614
And I think, at the college level, I think Ed Heiler has a, you know, that's one of the things I kind of fault him on.

24:55.575 --> 24:59.060
I think he's not gotten beyond us thinking we can be everything to everybody.

25:00.082 --> 25:03.326
So we've not made some hard decisions there that we probably could make.

25:04.087 --> 25:08.794
And we probably haven't made some hard ones in the department that we need to make.

25:09.230 --> 25:20.464
the balance that right now in terms of grant dollars, the biotech, genetics, molecular biology, they're swinging the big stick.

25:22.727 --> 25:38.427
I think there's a threat to the whole land-grant system stemming out of this with the increased emphasis on patenting genes, on getting royalties that goes back into plant breeders and geneticists' pockets.

25:38.879 --> 25:47.570
that an increasing percentage of the support to do the research is coming from soft money sources.

25:48.751 --> 26:07.435
There's not, there tends to be not nearly in new faculty the sense of servanthood that I think befits people in colleges of agriculture and land grant institutions.

26:08.258 --> 26:09.319
We're losing some of that.

26:10.421 --> 26:29.405
And it's causing, and maybe that's the biggest challenge I see in the department, is to maintain that spirit of serving the taxpayers who make it possible for you to be here and not have such a high emphasis on feathering your own nest.

26:30.186 --> 26:35.012
I tend to become more materialistic as a faculty.

26:35.032 --> 26:36.173
I don't like that.

26:36.473 --> 26:42.299
Are there some specialties within this department's scope that you think ought to get emphasis?

26:46.403 --> 26:48.185
You said can't be all things to all people.

26:48.926 --> 27:03.021
Well, for the major commodities in the state, grain circle of corn, cotton, wheat, small grains,

27:03.980 --> 27:12.169
we need to maintain a continuity of expertise from the very base level to the top.

27:13.811 --> 27:21.499
Because in many cases, the market for the products is not sufficiently large.

27:21.579 --> 27:27.065
It's gonna attract the large seed companies, and they're getting bigger all the time.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.548
So they only wanna do things that are

27:31.098 --> 27:33.681
where there's a big market for a product.

27:33.701 --> 27:40.448
So we have to meet the niche for those commodities.

27:40.468 --> 27:59.248
We have to maintain expertise in soil science as it relates to land use in the broadest sense from waste disposal to conservation to

28:00.292 --> 28:18.639
agricultural production to sustainability, more and more we're going to see the emphasis be more, at least short term, it's going to be more environmentally oriented, more urban concern oriented than it is, has been a traditional field crop agriculture.

28:18.659 --> 28:22.965
But here's some bias from cropping.

28:22.985 --> 28:29.775
But I think we'd be terribly remiss if we let our expertise and the broad range of

28:30.447 --> 28:32.669
of soil science, Paul.

28:32.689 --> 28:37.655
But we need to, we can't, we can't be really expert in all those areas.

28:37.715 --> 28:45.904
And I'd say we'd probably sacrifice some of what have been a traditional basic science, like soil physics.

28:45.924 --> 29:00.319
We have to have people that are functioning more at the interface maybe between, let's say, soils and environmental concerns, soils ecology, environmental

29:01.042 --> 29:03.628
There'll be more emphasis on integrating that.

29:06.394 --> 29:09.601
And hopefully a lot more cooperation between departments.

29:09.621 --> 29:13.029
You know, the department wall is a terrible barrier.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.372
Now we have the faculty.

29:14.392 --> 29:16.857
The faculties are across departments.

29:18.254 --> 29:21.397
I don't know, there's no easy answer to that kind of thing.

29:21.458 --> 29:44.463
If we could smooth out the barriers that prevent faculty from interacting across departmental walls, and faculty walls, and college walls, seem to be functioning better between universities than we can between right here on our own campus, in some instances.

29:44.683 --> 29:47.046
That's a big deal with Douglas,

29:47.752 --> 29:52.097
interacting more, but I wanted to do it and doing it, two different things.

29:52.818 --> 30:03.309
What were your proudest moments in all these years as a faculty member here?

30:03.570 --> 30:17.505
I guess maybe getting a note from a student that's in whose life, the note seems to say that you had a very positive impact on it.

30:18.346 --> 30:24.134
Because I know how many people think they're going to have a note like that and never do.

30:24.575 --> 30:30.583
How many times I've thought about doing something like that to be good.

30:32.186 --> 30:38.735
So, I think that would be my proudest moment, is to get those favorable comments.

30:39.676 --> 30:44.623
And there's not a whole lot of them, but when you do get them,

30:47.911 --> 30:48.752
questions.

30:48.772 --> 30:54.438
Summarize what you have in your heart about what it's meant to you to be a faculty member here.

30:58.142 --> 30:58.562
Okay.

30:58.582 --> 31:01.485
Well, I feel just extremely fortunate and blessed.

31:01.586 --> 31:06.691
I mean, I couldn't have done what I love to do and got paid for it.

31:06.711 --> 31:07.652
Family's had a good living.

31:09.174 --> 31:17.142
It's been, I've felt that I've had wonderful support, a lot of opportunities to interact with literally

31:17.864 --> 31:23.858
thousands, thousands of students at both graduate and undergraduate level
