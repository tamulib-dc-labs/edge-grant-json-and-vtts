WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:06.240
I want to mention something I want to make sure I 
covered. Please do. Over the, you know, the

00:07.587 --> 00:13.320
constant thing over the 30 or so years has been 
teaching

00:13.300 --> 00:21.590
that one course and being a graduate advisor in the 
department. So a lot of interaction with

00:21.770 --> 00:25.390
undergraduate and graduate students, which I've 
enjoyed in both cases. And I've been offered, I

00:27.950 --> 00:31.530
mean, I've been asked so many times, how in the 
world do you keep teaching that same course for 30

00:31.510 --> 00:34.610
years? Well, that I don't know. I don't really have 
an answer for that, except it's different

00:41.580 --> 00:43.320
students every semester. This is my last semester 
to do it this time, and I've just as decided about

00:46.020 --> 00:48.660
doing it as I'd ever be. It kind of feels funny. You 
just can't imagine not continuing to do it, to tell

00:51.140 --> 00:53.740
you the truth. But I've continued to enjoy it. But 
I've always tried to, at least every couple of

00:56.800 --> 01:01.700
semesters, do something different about the 
course. Add something about putting, redoing

01:06.300 --> 01:10.760
audio tapes, or now I've put all the objectives on 
the web. Last semester I did that. So something to

01:16.980 --> 01:21.220
keep me a little bit current. And something also to 
use different visual aids. And never to be too

01:27.480 --> 01:30.940
rigid in the lecture. Always. Kind of let it flow 
and cover things in a different order. But in

01:36.330 --> 01:39.930
addition to that, I think in the university 
community, there's so many opportunities to, I

01:39.910 --> 01:47.090
guess, be a servant or grow yourself. And so over 
the years, I've advised student clubs. Sometimes

01:51.530 --> 01:55.790
many as four at one time, but mainly I've always had 
at least one. Advised core outfits. Served as

01:58.410 --> 02:02.330
advisor to the political forum, student group, 
shortly after that. Got to meet Gerald Ford and a

02:02.750 --> 02:09.010
few other prominent people in those years. And 
enjoyed the heck out of that. Then served a couple

02:10.990 --> 02:14.530
of years on the MSC Consulate Directorate. Had

02:14.510 --> 02:34.500
a different kind of experience. Faculty senate in

02:34.480 --> 02:43.380
the department. Said, you know, we need to have 
somebody from the department be on the faculty

02:43.540 --> 02:48.540
senate. So I get, I mean, I didn't say anything to 
anybody. I get nominated and I end up on the faculty

02:51.760 --> 02:54.160
senate. And then. Uh. Hold on a second. Hold on a 
second. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. So, Fred

02:58.970 --> 03:01.950
Smines over in Rainside said, well, it's a shame. 
We're just going to let John McNermoth be the first

03:01.930 --> 03:05.950
speaker with no competition at all. Somebody 
ought to run against him. Wilford, you run against

03:08.190 --> 03:09.451
him. Why, I did. Well, of course. Unfortunate, 
deservedly, John. He's elected. But John makes me

03:17.318 --> 03:18.940
the deputy. And then, of course, this greases a 
wheel for me to be the speaker the next year. But I'm

03:24.600 --> 03:28.080
keeping all my teaching duties and all my advice 
all at the same time. But that was a, see, that was an

03:28.060 --> 03:34.580
outlet of different, and of course, the speaker 
year was a, that was a tremendous experience to

03:34.560 --> 03:40.320
interact with all of the higher administrators 
and that kind of deal. And it was a, it was an

03:41.300 --> 03:46.320
exciting time for the senate trying to get 
established. Did the senate, did the senate come

03:46.300 --> 03:52.760
up with any recommendation that you thought was a 
little goofy that you still had as their voice to

03:52.740 --> 03:56.020
support? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
remember. The only, and this happened actually

04:01.040 --> 04:06.840
after my year as speaker was over, the core 
curriculum was being developed during that year,

04:06.820 --> 04:11.060
all that year. And I'm not particularly proud of 
it, but I ended up in the final analysis voting

04:11.040 --> 04:17.180
against the final adoption of the core 
curriculum. Not because I opposed the core

04:20.550 --> 04:25.850
curriculum, but because there was always in the 
development of it, there had been, I quote, a

04:25.830 --> 04:30.570
technological requirement anticipated in it. 
And this got washed out at the end. And I, I felt so

04:33.730 --> 04:38.750
strongly about that that I ended up voting no. And I 
didn't feel real good about that. But I didn't have

04:41.730 --> 04:43.750
to promote that to the senate. I, no, I don't 
remember anything. I'm trying to remember. It had

04:48.730 --> 04:52.960
something to do with women's program or 
something. Gosh,

04:52.940 --> 05:02.600
I don't know if I have any notes about this or not. 
But Dr. Vandenberg called me into his office. And

05:03.580 --> 05:08.740
he was mad as a hornet. I mean, he was off the wall for 
just two or three minutes. Then he calmed down and

05:15.720 --> 05:18.740
we had a good conversation. But I, it was, it was 
something about the women's program. I think

05:24.420 --> 05:32.560
something that Ms. Schaffer, that Dr. Schaffer 
was the woman in charge of the women's committee

05:32.540 --> 05:34.560
program. I don't, I don't remember the 
particulars. But I do remember Dr. Vandenberg, he

05:37.540 --> 05:45.560
was mightily upset when the first one in. But he 
calmed down. He calmed down. What do you think?

05:49.540 --> 05:50.561
But, but I did that. And then I became a continuous 
improvement facilitator. Let's stay, let's stay

05:54.540 --> 05:57.560
with faculty senate just a second. What do you 
think the faculty's role in decision making for

05:57.540 --> 06:03.840
this institution? Ought to be? You

06:04.820 --> 06:16.300
know, I'm kind of comfortable with the senate 
being in an advisory role. I, I don't, I don't, I'm

06:16.280 --> 06:22.300
not one of those that quote thinks the faculty 
needs to make all the decisions. Because I don't,

06:23.280 --> 06:28.300
the faculty is just one component in the whole 
university community. And the, and the

06:28.280 --> 06:43.140
university president ultimately,

06:28.280 --> 06:43.140
yeah,

06:28.280 --> 06:43.140
an organized venue by which the faculty can make 
its decisions. To make its feelings known. And I

06:46.120 --> 06:58.020
think on matters of academics, it's, I would hope, 
I would hope that the president,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.020
and I think all of them have, tended to support 
senate decisions. There have been exceptions, I

07:02.000 --> 07:05.020
guess, but. In the department, should there be a 
department head or a department chairman? For,

07:09.000 --> 07:23.040
for department lock hours with a three agency deal 
and, and responsibilities, you know. I think the

07:23.387 --> 07:25.040
one thing that he's got to be careful about is the 
faculty. As far as the public is concerned. On

07:28.140 --> 08:56.220
Wednesday, whether or not they qualified or not, 
uh. Oh, so it got earlier and earlier. Kept getting

08:58.200 --> 08:59.221
earlier and earlier. You had to turn in senior 
grades. And it came first.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.730
It worked back three or four days. Oh, so it got 
earlier and earlier. It kept getting earlier and

09:09.010 --> 09:10.631
earlier. You had to turn in senior grades. And it 
came fast, because seniors were just, I mean, I

09:16.080 --> 09:20.680
taught a big class that would have 25% seniors. And 
I guess I did begin to get a little chapped about

09:20.660 --> 09:24.680
them not taking finals, because they would put off 
classes like mine for the last semester. So they

09:31.220 --> 09:33.730
didn't have to take my finals. Of all of those 
services, which ones were the most satisfying to

09:38.470 --> 09:43.590
you, as you look back? Each one while I was doing it. 
I wouldn't want to pick one. I guess the most

09:48.790 --> 09:51.290
different, of course, was being speaker at the 
faculty center for a year. Maybe that was the

09:55.350 --> 09:58.340
hideous kind of a deal. Get your tickets to the 
Texas game in Austin. We won. A few things like that

10:02.851 --> 10:07.320
I remember very well. But. Yeah. No, in the early 
days,

10:08.000 --> 10:16.270
being an advisor to a corps outfit, having come 
through the corps, there were a lot of good

10:19.170 --> 10:22.630
experiences associated with that. How do you feel 
about the corps as you look back on it now? How do you

10:27.540 --> 10:30.180
feel about the corps today? Much more military 
than it was

10:30.160 --> 10:36.140
then. Is it better or worse? Plus, minus? I haven't 
had real close contact in recent years, not to see

10:43.860 --> 10:47.440
much on the inside. I think it's been about,

10:47.420 --> 10:55.360
yeah, many more people, I guess you could say, many 
more people in the corps who really have a kind of a

10:58.220 --> 11:04.080
pro-military posture. See, when I came through 
the corps, many of us were there because we had to be

11:06.820 --> 11:08.101
there. It was either being in the corps or being in 
Korea. Yeah. The corps was preferable. It was

11:12.880 --> 11:14.830
preferable. So you had a major, major influence in 
the corps of people who were, yeah, we could kind of

11:20.270 --> 11:26.230
tolerate the bull and that kind of stuff and enjoy 
some of it, but we never had any dream about being a

11:28.210 --> 11:33.090
military somebody. I feel like there's been more, 
I think a lot of that's been, maybe gotten rid of in

11:38.430 --> 11:40.071
recent years, but I feel like there's been a lot 
more of what artists call really cheap stuff.

11:43.510 --> 11:53.780
During

11:43.510 --> 11:53.780
all those years, describe a typical week for you 
during the academic year. You started at Monday

11:57.290 --> 12:01.050
and did what and how long and so forth. Take a 
thorough week. How many nights were you busy and so

12:03.280 --> 12:05.680
forth? Well,

12:05.660 --> 12:15.340
with all of the kind of extracurricular 
activities and things I've had, there were

12:15.320 --> 12:18.920
probably not very many nights when I didn't have a 
meeting or do something at home. I've

12:20.327 --> 12:26.560
been a bicycle rider for a long time. I've 
normally, and I like to get here on the bicycle

12:26.540 --> 12:30.760
before the traffic gets too bad, and I'm normally 
not going home until it's not too bad again. So I've

12:35.420 --> 12:45.520
typically been at work from 7.30, 7.45 in the 
morning until 5.30 or 6 in the afternoon and

12:45.500 --> 12:46.921
usually bring lunch. We have a big lunch. We have a 
big lunch. a bridge playing group here, lunch, but

12:48.900 --> 12:56.190
during the school year, most of the time, I had an 8 
o'clock class on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. So

13:00.291 --> 13:02.160
you have to get here early to be ready to go for that. 
And I've had 1130 for many years now, 1130 to 1220

13:03.065 --> 13:07.951
class. So even for the bridge playing group, that 
cuts you lunch hours. Now what was this second

13:12.240 --> 13:13.661
class? The same class. Oh, same. Two sections. Two 
sections. Okay. And what did you tell your

13:19.113 --> 13:25.180
students that your office hours were for them to 
come by? You never had office hours. The door was

13:27.690 --> 13:28.711
open. I've always told them the door was open. Call 
me. Now it's email. You're welcome to come in any

13:32.690 --> 13:35.710
time you can catch me. That's what I always said. 
But I've never set rigid office hours. How would

13:42.690 --> 13:47.210
you compare the quality of the students now? Oh. 
With the students when you first got here? That's a

13:50.640 --> 13:53.273
hard read. I suspect, I suspect the overall 
quality in terms of academic capability is

13:58.980 --> 14:00.549
better. In terms of maturity, in the sense of the 
student knowing who they are and what they're

14:06.280 --> 14:09.883
about, it's not as good now as it was then. Class 
attendance generally is much poorer than it was in

14:12.560 --> 14:14.491
those days. Students can't take nearly as heavy a 
load as they used to, as I view it. They have, I don't

14:23.298 --> 14:27.380
know how many of them spend their time, but I mean I 
can visualize some of the options when you see them

14:27.360 --> 14:34.410
unload all the things they have. I mean there's TV, 
there's the internet, there's music, all of them

14:35.195 --> 14:41.410
have cars, they're mobile, they leave here on 
weekends. So, I just think there are a lot of

14:44.986 --> 14:50.410
competing things that we can do. So, I think it's a 
little bit more interesting to look at the quality

14:52.510 --> 14:58.640
of the students. I don't know if you can do 
something about the quality of the students. I

15:01.857 --> 15:02.140
mean I don't know. But, I don't know if you're going 
to get an A for students' attention. I don't see as

15:07.120 --> 15:09.842
much interest in learning as a general rule. I just 
don't see as much interest in learning. In your.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.140
your grading system now, in other words, what does 
it take to make an A now compared to then? I'd like to

15:21.968 --> 15:23.180
tell you it hasn't changed much. What? but not 
nearly as many make A's now as they did then. Is that

15:27.430 --> 15:28.291
right? No, sir. What about flunking? Many more 
today. Many more. Many more. Yeah, 1 to 3% in the

15:36.240 --> 15:39.100
early days. It runs in the seven, six to 10 now. I 
always thought I had to have at least 15% A's in

15:46.010 --> 15:51.030
class. I mean, I felt bad if I didn't have at least 
15% A's, and lots of semesters I'd have over 50% A's

15:54.290 --> 15:57.470
and B's. But not now. About 35% A's and B's now most 
of the time. It varies from semester to semester.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.280
Last summer, this past summer, but the summer 
before, I had a real good class, but this past

16:10.480 --> 16:13.280
summer, terrible. Now, this fall, looks like, I 
mean, I had 142, I had 162 in class Monday. Well,

16:19.460 --> 16:21.800
that's not bad. What about women enrollment in the 
class now compared to years ago? Well, I've had

16:27.650 --> 16:28.931
some summer classes with more women than men. This 
semester, seems that my percentage of women is

16:35.050 --> 16:37.870
quite a bit lower than it's been some time. And I'm 
assuming far more urban kids now. Oh yeah, for

16:40.570 --> 16:42.740
sure. Many internationals in the undergraduate 
course? Not many. Probably 5% less. I bet there are

16:51.950 --> 16:54.170
a lot more from broken homes than there would have 
been 20 years ago. I think that's the big change. I

16:59.240 --> 17:01.860
think kids are about as honest as they've ever 
been. I think the ability's there. I think the

17:06.320 --> 17:10.680
maturity factor, in terms of them feeling good 
about themselves, having a well-developed

17:10.660 --> 17:22.960
ethos, code to live by. I just think many of them are 
not there. Do you have much indication of

17:28.920 --> 17:35.640
scholastic dishonesty now? No, I wouldn't say, 
that's what I say. I think they're better. They're

17:38.300 --> 17:40.080
about as honest as they've ever been. I don't see, 
I've had a little of that all along, but I don't

17:43.640 --> 17:48.740
think they're any less honest. I think, I've 
always said students tend to live up or down to your

17:53.940 --> 17:57.050
expectations in that arena. You have high 
expectations of them, in terms of honesty. I think

17:59.890 --> 18:02.500
you generally get it. How many students do you 
reckon you taught in that class? I have a record

18:05.040 --> 18:09.580
down the stairs. I don't think I made 18,000, but 
I'm close, between 17,500 and 18,000. All right,

18:18.770 --> 18:28.800
now I'm getting near the end.

18:28.780 --> 18:32.180
Among your departmental colleagues, to whom do 
you feel the greatest appreciation? I'm

18:32.160 --> 18:39.190
not going to ask you the negative.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.010
Which colleagues are you more grateful to? Well, 
probably Larry Wilding, in terms of what a

18:40.990 --> 18:43.940
colleague has meant to me personally. I think he's 
a great person. He's a great person. He's a great

18:45.920 --> 18:46.941
person. I thought Larry was a great guy. I thought 
he was a great guy. I thought he was a great guy. My

18:54.680 --> 18:55.701
own professional life. Larry's made us all 
better. He's certainly been a strong plus for me,

18:57.680 --> 19:06.500
in some of the things I've been able to experience 
and

19:06.480 --> 19:09.916
do. Hank Mills was somebody I always have a lot of 
respect for. He was a very different guy. He had a

19:17.140 --> 19:19.560
master's degree. Oh, he's Texas country boy. But, 
yeah.

19:25.743 --> 19:30.780
I guess in the early years, I had about as close 
association with him as anybody. Some pretty good

19:30.760 --> 19:38.050
country wisdom there that he could impart. He 
could read students. He could read students.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.200
You're inferring that he was a buddy? Yeah, kind 
of. Yeah. Who's been your closest buddies,

19:47.514 --> 19:58.300
friends, in the department or elsewhere on the 
campus?

19:58.280 --> 20:08.440
You know, I don't think I could say that I've been, I 
don't think I've singled on anybody like that. We

20:09.164 --> 20:15.480
have a departmental bridge group that gets 
together once a month, and so I guess you, Larry and

20:15.460 --> 20:16.481
Gladys. So, Larry and Gladys are probably, by 
virtue of church and department and everything,

20:16.460 --> 20:24.200
have probably been closer to them. Yeah. Yeah. 
Yeah. I think Marcia was always close to Darce

20:28.361 --> 20:36.300
Darby, and Cedric Van Buechman lives down the 
street, but I was never, you know, always liked to

20:36.280 --> 20:46.420
interact with Ron and Hans, but never, I've never, 
I guess you'd have to say Larry, and yet we don't

20:46.400 --> 20:54.710
spend a lot of time together. Alright, looking up 
in the hierarchy, to whom do you think you're most

20:54.690 --> 21:00.280
familiar with? Who do you think, because of what 
they have meant to the institution, do you feel the

21:05.260 --> 21:11.620
greatest gratitude at the college and at the 
institutional level? Who's been, who did the most

21:11.600 --> 21:15.930
to make A&M better? You think at the college? Well, 
of course, I don't have that whole perception.

21:20.910 --> 21:23.930
University, I'd have to say Earl Rutter. Okay. 
Because Earl Rutter was... And it doesn't have to

21:25.910 --> 21:26.931
be just one, are there... He was the man in the spot 
at the time. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he, he obviously,

21:30.910 --> 21:36.930
his service here preceded me, but I, but I think he 
probably considered where A&M was when it came, or

21:36.910 --> 21:40.930
where it was going when he left. He probably had the 
most profound influence on anybody that I could

21:40.910 --> 21:45.930
think of. Anybody? In the college? Mm-hmm.

22:04.573 --> 22:09.380
I'm guessing that Patterson probably did as much 
to wake it up to what it could possibly be, and

22:09.360 --> 22:12.380
that's more hearsay than any knowledge. I've 
never done any very big study on that. Okay.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.380
Probably Harry Conkle. Okay. Now... Let's make 
believe that you've been recruited now as the

22:20.360 --> 22:22.500
consultant to advise the department What

22:23.480 --> 22:42.500
would

22:23.480 --> 22:42.500
you advise

22:23.480 --> 22:42.500
the department, and the college, and the 
institution of what it should do in the future?

22:43.480 --> 22:53.660
What would you advise this department to do in the 
future?

22:53.640 --> 22:56.660
I'm going to go at it the backward way a little bit. 
Okay.

23:00.837 --> 23:01.220
Institution. I hope we don't lose sight of what it 
is that I think makes A&M unique in terms of can-do

23:09.760 --> 23:14.780
attitude, friendliness, openness, that kind of 
thing. And I think, I think some of those things

23:14.760 --> 23:20.780
that contribute most to making it what, I've 
always said in my classes, you know, I've been to

23:20.760 --> 23:24.780
Wisconsin, I've been to Cornell, I've been here. 
I'm not about to tell you that Texas A&M is the best

23:25.888 --> 23:30.780
institution I've ever been associated with, but I 
am going to tell you it's unique. And I really

23:33.760 --> 23:37.940
believe it's unique. And I, particularly what I 
consider the positive parts of that uniqueness, I

23:37.920 --> 23:42.940
hope we don't lose. And I don't think those, those 
points are going to help us be top ten. I mean, I

23:48.160 --> 23:50.180
think if you get all wrapped up in being top ten, you 
know, you're going to get all wrapped up in being

23:50.160 --> 23:56.180
top ten, we can lose, we can lose some things that, 
that may not contribute to just being top ten, but

23:56.160 --> 24:02.180
make us unique in a desirable way. So I hope as an 
institution we don't lose sight of that. In a

24:07.480 --> 24:25.160
department,

24:07.480 --> 24:25.160
there obviously,

24:07.480 --> 24:25.160
there needs to be an ability to,

24:07.480 --> 24:25.160
to bring all areas along in it. Well, we're going to 
have to identify, probably to an extent we haven't

24:26.650 --> 24:31.160
done, we're going to have to identify the areas 
where we want to be top flight and where we just want

24:31.140 --> 24:37.160
to be, meet our, quote, academic 
responsibilities. I don't think we can be, I don't

24:40.160 --> 24:44.180
think we can be everything to everybody. And I 
think, I think at the college level, I think Ed

24:44.160 --> 24:52.300
Heiler has a, you know, that's one of the things I 
kind of fault him on. I think he, I think he's not.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.300
He's not gotten beyond us thinking we'd be 
everything to everybody. So we've not made some

24:59.280 --> 25:04.300
hard decisions there that we probably could make. 
And we probably haven't made some hard ones in the

25:04.280 --> 25:09.300
department that we need to make. The balance that, 
right now, in terms of grant dollars, the biotech,

25:09.280 --> 25:16.300
genetics, molecular biology, they're, they're 
swinging a big stick.

25:22.460 --> 25:25.480
I think there's a threat to the whole land grant 
system. Stemming land. Stemming out of this with

25:27.028 --> 25:33.480
an increased emphasis on patenting genes, on 
getting royalties that goes back into plant

25:33.460 --> 25:38.480
breeders' and geneticists' pockets. That an 
increasing percentage of the support to do the

25:38.460 --> 25:46.480
research is coming from soft money sources. 
There's not, there, there tends to be not nearly in

25:48.791 --> 25:54.760
new faculty the support that we need. There's not 
the sense of servanthood that I think befits

25:55.161 --> 26:06.420
people in colleges of agriculture and land grant 
institutions. We're losing some of that. And it's

26:11.080 --> 26:17.100
causing, and maybe that's the biggest challenge I 
see in the department, is to maintain that, that

26:17.080 --> 26:25.160
spirit of serving the taxpayers who make it 
possible for you to be here and have such a, a high

26:25.140 --> 26:30.160
emphasis on feathering your own nest. It tends to 
become more materialistic as a, as a faculty. I

26:35.140 --> 26:36.161
don't like that. Are there some, are there some 
specialties within this department's scope that

26:36.140 --> 26:41.160
you think ought to get emphasis?

26:46.240 --> 26:48.260
You said it can't be all things to all people. Yeah. 
Well, for the, for the major, for the major

26:49.265 --> 26:54.630
commodities in the state. Grains are corn, 
cotton,

26:54.610 --> 27:04.460
small grains. We need to maintain a continuity of 
expertise from the very base level to the top.

27:10.140 --> 27:19.320
Because in many cases the market for the products 
is not sufficiently large that it's going to

27:19.300 --> 27:22.320
attract the large seed companies. And they're 
getting bigger all the time. So they only want to do

27:26.420 --> 27:28.440
things that are super small. Great. Thank you. 
where there's a big market for a product so we have

27:31.180 --> 27:37.680
to we have to meet the niche for those commodities 
we have to maintain expertise in in soil science as

27:37.660 --> 27:48.900
it relates to land use in the broadest sense from 
waste disposal to conservation to agricultural

27:50.790 --> 28:01.980
production to sustainability more and more we're 
going to see the emphasis be more in at least short

28:01.960 --> 28:09.420
term it's going to be more environmentally 
oriented more urban concern oriented than it is

28:09.400 --> 28:15.180
has been a traditional field crop agriculture but 
here's some bias and cropping but i think we'd be

28:15.160 --> 28:24.660
terribly remiss if we let our let our expertise and 
the broad range of soil science fall but we need to

28:32.560 --> 28:39.460
we can't we can't be really expert in all those 
areas and i'd say we'd we'd probably sacrifice

28:39.440 --> 28:47.860
some of what have been a traditional basic science 
like soil physics or have to have people that are

28:47.840 --> 28:57.230
functioning more at the interface maybe between 
let's say soils and and environmental concerns

28:57.210 --> 29:03.390
soils ecology environment there'll be more 
emphasis on integrating integrating that and and

29:04.090 --> 29:11.150
hopefully a lot more cooperation between 
departments you know the department wall is a

29:11.130 --> 29:18.950
terrible barrier now we have the faculty 
faculties are across departments i don't know

29:18.930 --> 29:25.990
there's no easy answer to that kind of thing if we 
could smooth out the barriers that prevent

29:25.970 --> 29:33.780
faculty from interacting across departmental 
walls and faculty walls and college walls seem to

29:35.780 --> 29:40.840
be functioning better between universities than 
they can between right here on their own campus

29:40.820 --> 29:46.760
some in some instances now that's you know that's a 
big deal with douglas he's got us interacting more

29:47.700 --> 29:54.620
but wanted to do it doing it two different things 
what were your proudest moments in all these years

29:54.600 --> 30:06.860
as a faculty member here

29:54.600 --> 30:06.860
i guess i guess maybe getting a note from a student 
that's life the note seems to say that you've had a

30:11.040 --> 30:17.260
very positive impact on it because i know how many 
people think they're going to have a note like that

30:18.290 --> 30:22.550
never do how many times i've thought about doing 
something like that and being good so so when i

30:28.690 --> 30:35.620
think that i think that'd be my proudest moment is 
to get those get those favorable comments from and

30:37.120 --> 30:41.700
they're not a whole lot of them but when you do get 
them

30:43.220 --> 30:51.390
questions summarize what you have in your heart 
about what it's to you to be a faculty member here

30:52.520 --> 31:01.920
well i feel i feel just extremely fortunate and 
blessed i mean i couldn't i've done what i love to do

31:01.900 --> 31:07.580
and got paid for it family's had a good living it's 
been i've i've felt that i've had wonderful

31:08.980 --> 31:16.040
support a lot of opportunities to interact with 
literally wow thousands of students of both

31:16.020 --> 31:23.730
graduate and undergraduate
