WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:06.328
I want to mention something I want to make sure I 
covered. Please do. Over the, you know, the

00:07.590 --> 00:21.804
constant thing over the 30 or so years has been 
teaching

00:07.590 --> 00:21.804
that one course and being a graduate advisor in the 
department. So a lot of interaction with

00:21.824 --> 00:28.010
undergraduate and graduate students, which I've 
enjoyed in both cases. And I've been offered, I

00:28.070 --> 00:31.573
mean, I've been asked so many times how in the world 
do you keep teaching the same course for 30 years?

00:36.093 --> 00:38.355
Well, that I don't know. Don't really have an 
answer for that, except it's different students

00:39.917 --> 00:43.741
every semester. This is my last semester to do it 
this time, and I'm just as excited about it as I've

00:44.141 --> 00:48.766
ever been. Kind of feels funny. You just can't 
imagine not continuing to do it, to tell you the

00:51.169 --> 00:54.713
truth. But I've continued to enjoy it. But I've 
always tried to, at least every, couple of

01:00.578 --> 01:28.999
semesters do something different about the 
course add add something about putting redoing

01:00.578 --> 01:28.999
audio tapes or now i put all the objectives on the 
web last semester i did that so something to keep me

01:00.578 --> 01:28.999
a little bit current and and something also to use 
different visual aids and and never to be too rigid

01:29.165 --> 01:31.028
in the lecture. I always kind of let it flow and 
cover things in different order. But in addition

01:36.375 --> 01:47.131
to that, I think in the university community, 
there's so many opportunities to, I guess, be a

01:36.375 --> 01:47.131
servant or grow yourself. And so over the years, I 
would buy student clubs, sometimes as many as four

01:48.833 --> 01:53.419
at one time. But mainly, I've always had at least 
one. Buys core outfits. Served as advisor to the

01:59.270 --> 02:04.103
Political Forum student group shortly after I 
came here. Got to meet Gerald Ford and a few other

02:04.123 --> 02:11.141
prominent people in those years and enjoyed the 
heck out of that. Then served a couple years on the

02:11.362 --> 02:14.591
MSC Council and Directorate. That's different.

02:34.285 --> 02:42.736
The faculty senate had no intent on including me in 
the people senate. And the department said, we

02:42.756 --> 02:49.986
need to have somebody from the department be on the 
faculty senate. So I didn't say anything to

02:50.006 --> 02:51.828
anybody. I got nominated, and I ended up on the 
faculty senate. And then, oh.

02:58.602 --> 03:01.925
Fred Smines over in Rainside said, well, it's a 
shame. We're just going to let John McNermott be

03:02.086 --> 03:05.930
the first speaker with no competition at all. 
Somebody ought to run against him. Wilford, you

03:08.212 --> 03:11.055
run against him. Well, I did. Well, of course, 
unfortunate, deservedly, John, he's elected.

03:17.302 --> 03:24.109
But John makes me the deputy, and then, of course, 
just greases a wheel for me to be the speaker the

03:17.302 --> 03:24.109
next year. But I'm keeping all my teaching duties 
and all my advice all at the same time. but that was a

03:28.943 --> 03:46.328
see that was an outlet of different and of course 
the speaker year was a tremendous experience to

03:28.943 --> 03:46.328
interact with all of the higher administrators 
and that kind of deal and it was a it was an exciting

03:28.943 --> 03:46.328
time for the senate trying to get established. Did 
the senate did the senate come up with any

03:46.648 --> 03:57.043
recommendation that you thought was a little 
goofy that you still had as their voice to support?

03:59.487 --> 04:00.769
I don't remember. And this happened actually 
after my year as speaker was over. The core

04:05.916 --> 04:10.042
curriculum was being developed during that year, 
all that year. And I'm not particularly proud of

04:10.082 --> 04:18.955
it, but I ended up in the final analysis voting 
against the final adoption of the core

04:10.082 --> 04:18.955
curriculum. Not because I opposed the core 
curriculum, but because there was always in the

04:20.397 --> 04:28.228
development of it, there had been, I quote, a 
technological requirement anticipated and this

04:28.445 --> 04:44.369
got washed out at the end and I felt so strongly 
about that that I ended up voting no and I didn't

04:28.445 --> 04:44.369
feel real good about that but I didn't have to 
promote that to the Senate. No, I don't remember

04:44.510 --> 04:47.094
anything. I'm trying to remember

04:47.174 --> 04:56.528
it had something to do

04:47.174 --> 04:56.528
with women's program or something gosh i don't 
know if i have any notes about this or not but dr

04:57.200 --> 05:26.346
vandenberg called me into his office and he was mad 
as a hornet i mean he was off the wall for just two or

04:57.200 --> 05:26.346
three minutes then he calmed down and we had a good 
conversation but i it was it was something about

04:57.200 --> 05:26.346
the women's program i think something Miss 
Schaefer, Dr. Schaefer was the woman in charge of

05:26.967 --> 05:35.592
the women's committee program. I don't remember 
the particulars, but I do remember Dr. Vandiver,

05:35.612 --> 05:41.027
he was mightily upset when first went in, but he 
calmed down. He calmed down. What do you think? But

05:49.595 --> 05:55.660
I did that, and then I became a continuous 
improvement facilitator. Let's stay with

05:55.941 --> 05:57.522
faculty Senate in a second. What do you think the 
faculty's role in decision-making for this

05:58.003 --> 06:05.229
institution ought to be? Hmm.

06:11.483 --> 06:16.530
You know, I'm kind of comfortable with the Senate 
being in an advisory role. I'm not one of those

06:17.411 --> 06:32.412
that, quote, thinks the faculty needs to make all 
the decisions, because the faculty is just one

06:17.411 --> 06:32.412
component in the whole university community, and 
the university president ultimately, yeah.

06:40.272 --> 06:46.841
an organized venue by which the faculty can make 
its feelings known. And I think on matters of

06:46.861 --> 07:02.181
academics, I would hope that the president,

06:46.861 --> 07:02.181
and I think all of them have, tended to support 
Senate decisions. There have been exceptions, I

07:02.722 --> 07:04.284
guess. In the department, should there be a 
department head or a department chairman?

07:12.841 --> 07:28.251
Well,

07:12.841 --> 07:28.251
for department lock hours with a three agency deal 
and responsibilities out of state and in state, I

07:12.841 --> 07:28.251
think it needs to be ahead.

08:55.694 --> 09:01.504
through Wednesday, whether or not they qualified 
or not.

09:03.208 --> 09:07.816
Well, I think it, I don't know, but I remember it 
worked back three or four days. Oh, so it got

09:07.836 --> 09:09.258
earlier and earlier. It kept getting earlier and 
earlier. She had to turn in senior grades, and it

09:10.721 --> 09:13.266
came fast. Because seniors are just, I mean, I 
taught a big class in heaven. 25% of seniors. And I

09:20.706 --> 09:33.778
guess I did begin to get a little chapped about them 
not taking finals because they would put off

09:20.706 --> 09:33.778
classes like mine until the last semester so they 
didn't have to take my final. Of all of those

09:33.798 --> 09:41.245
services, which ones were the most satisfying to 
you as you look back? Each one while I was doing it. I

09:47.671 --> 09:48.432
wouldn't want to pick I guess the most different, 
of course, was being Speaker of the Faculty Senate

09:48.715 --> 09:55.361
for a year. Maybe that was the hideous kind of a 
deal. Get your tickets to the Texas game in Austin,

09:58.344 --> 10:02.828
win one. A few things like that, I remember very 
well. But no, in the early days,

10:07.352 --> 10:18.182
being an advisor to a corps outfit, having come 
through the corps, There were a lot of good

10:18.635 --> 10:21.739
experiences associated with that. How do you feel 
about the Corps as you look back on it now? What do

10:27.586 --> 10:29.068
you feel about the Corps today? Much more military 
than it was then.

10:36.216 --> 10:37.578
Is it better or worse? Plus, minus? I haven't had 
real close contact in recent years, not to see much

10:41.082 --> 10:46.549
on the inside. I think it's been,

10:47.339 --> 11:02.862
yeah, many more people, I guess you could say, many 
more people in the Corps who really have a kind of a

10:47.339 --> 11:02.862
pro-military posture. See, when I came through 
the Corps, many of us were there because we had to be

11:04.144 --> 11:08.531
there. It was either be in the Corps or be in Korea. 
The Corps was preferable. So you had a major, major

11:14.897 --> 11:31.579
influence in the Corps of people who were, yeah, 
you know, we could kind of tolerate the bull and

11:14.897 --> 11:31.579
that kind of stuff and enjoy some of it, but we never 
had any dream about being a military somebody. I

11:33.181 --> 11:34.963
feel like there's been more I think a lot of that's 
been maybe gotten rid of in recent years, but I feel

11:36.513 --> 11:47.945
like there's been a lot more what artists call 
really cheap stuff go on. During all those years,

11:48.625 --> 11:55.092
describe a typical week for you during the 
academic year. You started at Monday and did what

11:57.254 --> 12:00.898
and how long and so forth. Take a thorough week. How 
many nights were you busy and so forth? Well,

12:06.382 --> 12:20.902
with all of the kind of extracurricular 
activities and things I've had, there's probably

12:06.382 --> 12:20.902
not very many nights when I didn't have a meeting or 
do something at home related to the job. I've

12:21.963 --> 12:25.468
normally, I've been a bicycle rider for a long 
time. I've normally, and I like to get here on

12:26.530 --> 12:34.441
bicycle before the traffic gets too bad, and I've 
normally not gone home until it's not too bad

12:26.530 --> 12:34.441
again. So, I've typically been at work from 7.30, 
7.45 in the morning until 5.30 or 6 in the

12:37.229 --> 12:48.547
afternoon, and usually bring lunch. We have a 
bridge playing group here, lunch. But during the

12:52.253 --> 12:58.984
school year, most of the time, I've had an 8 o'clock 
class on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. So you have to

13:00.179 --> 13:02.782
get here early to be ready to go for that. And I've 
had 1130 for many years now, 1130 to 1220 class. So

13:08.007 --> 13:12.292
even for the playing group, that cuts you lunch 
hours. And what was this second class? The same

13:14.294 --> 13:15.095
class. Oh, same. Two sections. Two sections. OK. 
And what did you tell your students that your

13:17.618 --> 13:25.446
office hours were for them to come by? You never had 
office hours. Door was open. I always told them the

13:28.509 --> 13:29.410
door was open. called me, now it's email. You're 
welcome to come in any time you can catch me. That's

13:35.231 --> 13:37.093
what I always said. But I've never set rigid office 
hours. How would you compare the quality of the

13:43.681 --> 13:50.269
students now with the students when you first got 
here? That's a hard read. I suspect the overall

13:54.254 --> 13:59.380
quality in terms of academic capability is 
better. In terms of maturity, in the sense of the

14:00.406 --> 14:09.898
student knowing who they are and what they're 
about, it's not as good now as it was then. Class

14:10.378 --> 14:14.483
attendance generally is much poorer than it was in 
those days. Students can't take nearly as heavy a

14:15.525 --> 14:23.274
load as I do. They have, I don't know how many of them 
spend their time, but I mean I can visualize some of

14:23.294 --> 14:29.822
the options. when you see them unload all the 
things they have. I mean, there's TV. There's the

14:36.020 --> 14:37.381
internet. There's music. All of them have cars. 
They're mobile. They leave here on weekends. So I

14:44.989 --> 14:52.337
just think there are a lot of competing things for 
students' attention. I don't see as much interest

14:53.678 --> 15:00.045
in learning.

15:01.038 --> 15:04.542
As a general rule, I just don't see as much interest 
in learning. I just didn't get a degree, but I don't

15:04.562 --> 15:08.446
see much interest in learning. In that course that 
you've been doing all these years, how does your

15:08.466 --> 15:18.958
grading system now, in other words, what does it 
take to make an A now compared to then?

15:21.901 --> 15:27.408
I'd like to tell you it hasn't changed much, but not 
nearly as many make As now as they did then. Is that

15:27.428 --> 15:27.968
right? No, sir. What about flunking? Oh, many more 
today. Many more. Many more. Yeah, 1 to 3% in the

15:36.226 --> 15:39.191
early days. It runs in the 7, 6 to 10 now.

15:46.844 --> 15:51.191
I always thought I had to have at least 15% As in 
class. I mean, I felt bad if I didn't have at least

15:51.211 --> 15:54.237
15% As. And lots of semesters, I'd have over 50% As 
and Bs. But not now. About 35% A's and B's now most of

15:59.306 --> 16:02.010
the time. It varies from semester to semester. 
Last summer, not this past summer, but the summer

16:04.835 --> 16:10.363
before, I had a real good class. But this past 
summer, terrible. Now this fall, looks like, I

16:13.348 --> 16:19.518
mean I had 142, I had 162 in class Monday. Well, 
that's not bad. What about women enrollment in the

16:22.402 --> 16:26.108
class now compared to years ago? I've had some 
summer classes with more women than men. This

16:31.178 --> 16:37.166
semester, it seems that my percentage of women is 
quite a bit lower than it's been some time. And I'm

16:37.887 --> 16:40.570
assuming far more urban kids now. Oh, yeah. For 
sure. For sure. Many internationals in the

16:42.833 --> 16:45.317
undergraduate course? Not many. Not many. 
Probably 5% less. I bet there are a lot more from

16:51.985 --> 16:56.331
broken homes than there would have been 20 years 
ago. I think that's the big change. I think kids are

16:59.246 --> 17:01.488
about as honest as they've ever been. I think the 
ability's there. I think the maturity factor in

17:06.394 --> 17:25.035
terms of them feeling good about themselves, 
having a well-developed

17:06.394 --> 17:25.035
ethos, code to live by. I just think many of them are 
not there. Do you have much indication of

17:28.968 --> 17:35.394
scholastic dishonesty now? No, I wouldn't say. 
That's what I say. I think they're about as honest

17:37.837 --> 17:40.419
as they've ever been. I don't see, I've had to live 
with that all along, but I don't think they're any

17:40.439 --> 17:50.449
less honest.

17:51.340 --> 17:57.068
I've always said students tend to live up or down to 
your expectations in that arena. You have high

17:57.088 --> 17:59.953
expectations of them in terms of honesty. I think 
you generally get it. How many students you reckon

18:02.616 --> 18:04.940
you taught in that class?

18:07.804 --> 18:09.106
I have a record downstairs. I don't think I made 
18,000, but I'm close. Between 17,500 and 18,000.

18:18.492 --> 18:41.023
um all right now i'm getting near the end uh 
appreciate among your departmental colleagues

18:18.492 --> 18:41.023
to whom do you feel the greatest appreciation

18:18.492 --> 18:41.023
i'm not going to ask you the negative

18:18.492 --> 18:41.023
which colleagues are you more grateful to Well, 
probably Larry Wilding in terms of what a

18:42.168 --> 18:49.658
colleague has meant to me personally in my own 
professional life.

18:53.483 --> 18:56.206
I think a lot of people in the department would 
probably say that. Larry's made us all better.

18:59.410 --> 19:05.278
He's certainly been a strong plus for me in some of 
the things I've been able to experience and do.

19:09.944 --> 19:11.466
Hank Mills was a Somebody I always have a lot of 
respect for. He was a very different guy. Only had a

19:17.684 --> 19:19.025
master's degree. Oh, he's a Texas country boy. But

19:22.208 --> 19:30.516
I guess in the early years I had about as close 
association with him as anybody.

19:33.198 --> 19:38.003
Some pretty good country wisdom there that he 
could impart. He could read students. You're

19:40.150 --> 19:43.633
inferring he was a buddy? Yeah, kind of, yeah. 
Who's been your closest buddies, friends, in the

19:47.517 --> 19:55.345
department or elsewhere on the campus?

19:58.248 --> 20:05.635
You know, I don't think I could say that I've been, I 
don't think I've, singled on anybody like that. We

20:09.149 --> 20:16.881
have a departmental bridge group that gets 
together once a month, and so I guess Larry and

20:09.149 --> 20:16.881
Gladys. So Larry and Gladys are probably, by 
virtue of church and department and everything,

20:16.901 --> 20:25.514
have probably been closer to them. They were quite 
close to the Runge's during their years here.

20:30.541 --> 20:34.407
Marcia was always close to Darce Darby.

20:35.585 --> 20:55.173
And DeSegre Van Bietman lives down the street, but 
I was never, you know, always liked to interact

20:35.585 --> 20:55.173
with Ron and Hans, but never, I've never, I guess 
you'd have to say Larry, and yet we don't spend a lot

20:35.585 --> 20:55.173
of time together. All right, looking up in the 
hierarchy, to whom do you think, because of what

20:55.193 --> 21:03.685
they have meant to the institution, do you feel the 
greatest gratitude at the college and at the

21:04.154 --> 21:12.245
institutional level?

21:12.586 --> 21:14.589
Who did the most to make A&M better? You think at the 
college? Well, of course, I don't have the whole

21:17.513 --> 21:20.877
perception. At the university, I'd have to say 
Earl Rutter. And it doesn't have to be just one. He

21:27.707 --> 21:30.911
was the man in the spot at the time. I mean, he 
Obviously his service here preceded me, but I

21:31.930 --> 21:40.878
think he probably considered where A&M was when it 
came, or where it was going when he left. He

21:40.898 --> 21:46.663
probably had the most profound influence on 
anybody that I could think of. In the college? Boy.

22:04.415 --> 22:12.506
I'm guessing that Patterson probably did as much 
to wake it up to what it could possibly be and that's

22:04.415 --> 22:12.506
more hearsay than any knowledge. I've never done 
any very big study on that.

22:18.715 --> 22:19.876
Probably Harry Conkle. He had strengths and 
weaknesses, but I think I'd have to say Harry. The

22:27.046 --> 22:31.873
department has to be Bloodworth without a shadow 
of a doubt. Let's make believe that you've been

22:32.309 --> 22:44.048
recruited now as the consultant to advise the 
department and the college and the institution of

22:32.309 --> 22:44.048
what it should do in the future. What would you 
advise this department to do in the future?

22:53.604 --> 22:57.370
I'm going to go at it the backward way a little bit. 
Okay.

23:00.845 --> 23:13.882
I hope we don't lose sight of what it is that I think 
makes A&M unique in terms of can-do attitude,

23:00.845 --> 23:13.882
friendliness, openness, that kind of thing. And I 
think some of those things that contribute most to

23:15.264 --> 23:21.132
making it what... I've always said in my classes, 
you know, I've been to Wisconsin, I've been to

23:21.172 --> 23:25.237
Cornell, I've been here. I'm not about to tell you 
that Texas A&M is the best institution I've ever

23:25.918 --> 23:29.603
been. been associated with, but I am going to tell 
you it's unique. And I really believe it's unique.

23:37.862 --> 23:42.968
And particularly what I consider the positive 
parts of that uniqueness, I hope we don't lose. And

23:44.350 --> 23:48.535
I don't think those points are going to help us be 
top 10. I mean, I think if you get all wrapped up in

23:49.175 --> 23:55.843
being top 10, we can lose some things. that may not 
contribute to us being top 10, but make us unique in

23:56.043 --> 24:01.510
a desirable way. So I hope as an institution we 
don't lose sight of that. In a department,

24:07.497 --> 24:25.560
there obviously,

24:07.497 --> 24:25.560
there needs to be an ability to

24:07.497 --> 24:25.560
bring all areas along in it well we're going to have 
to identify it probably to an extent we haven't

24:25.945 --> 24:54.822
done we're going to have to identify the areas 
where we want to be top flight and where we just want

24:25.945 --> 24:54.822
to be meet our quote academic responsibilities i 
don't think we can be i don't think we can be

24:25.945 --> 24:54.822
everything to everybody and i think i think at the 
college level i think ed hyler has a you know what's

24:25.945 --> 24:54.822
one of the things i kind of fault him on i think he I 
think he's not gotten beyond us thinking we'd be

24:55.477 --> 24:59.082
everything to everybody. So we've not made some 
hard decisions there that we probably could make.

25:04.769 --> 25:09.595
And we probably haven't made some hard ones in the 
department that we need to make. The balance that

25:09.635 --> 25:22.731
right now, in terms of grant dollars, the biotech, 
genetics, molecular biology, they're swinging

25:09.635 --> 25:22.731
the big stick.

25:22.751 --> 25:24.994
I think there's a threat to the whole land grant 
system stemming out of this with an increased

25:25.379 --> 25:47.604
emphasis on patenting genes, on getting 
royalties that goes back into plant breeders and

25:25.379 --> 25:47.604
geneticists' pockets, that an increasing 
percentage of the support to do the research is

25:25.379 --> 25:47.604
coming from soft money sources. There's not There 
tends to be not nearly in new faculty the sense of

25:50.692 --> 26:07.334
servanthood that I think befits people in 
colleges of agriculture and land grant

25:50.692 --> 26:07.334
institutions. We're losing some of that. And it's 
causing, and maybe that's the biggest challenge I

26:10.498 --> 26:19.990
see in the department, is to maintain that spirit 
of serving the taxpayers who make it possible for

26:20.290 --> 26:34.949
you to be here and not have such a high emphasis on 
feathering your own nest tend to become more

26:20.290 --> 26:34.949
materialistic as a faculty. I don't like that. Are 
there some specialties within this department

26:36.571 --> 26:42.339
scope that you think ought to get emphasis?

26:46.464 --> 26:48.407
You said can't be all things to all people. Well, 
for the major commodities in the state, grain,

26:48.893 --> 27:13.882
sorghum, corn, cotton,

26:48.893 --> 27:13.882
wheat, small grains, we need to maintain a 
continuity of expertise from the very base level

26:48.893 --> 27:13.882
to the top. Because in many cases, the market for 
the products is not sufficiently large, it's

27:19.218 --> 27:25.610
going to attract the large seed companies. And 
they're getting bigger all the time. So they only

27:27.553 --> 27:33.364
want to do things that are where there's a big 
market for a product. So we have to meet the niche

27:33.764 --> 27:38.433
for those commodities. We have to maintain 
expertise in in soil science as it relates to land

27:45.847 --> 28:06.910
use in the broadest sense from waste disposal to to 
conservation to agricultural production to

27:45.847 --> 28:06.910
sustainability more and more we're going to see 
the emphasis be more, at least short term, it's

28:07.345 --> 28:18.645
going to be more environmental oriented, more 
urban concern oriented than it has been in

28:07.345 --> 28:18.645
traditional field crop agriculture. But here's 
some bias in cropping. But I think we'd be terribly

28:23.012 --> 28:32.188
remiss if we let our expertise in the broad range of 
soil science fall. But we can't be really expert in

28:32.624 --> 28:37.670
all those areas. And I'd say we'd probably 
sacrifice some of what have been a traditional

28:37.730 --> 28:45.919
basic science, like soil physics. We have to have 
people that are functioning more at the interface

28:45.939 --> 29:00.336
maybe between, let's say, soils and 
environmental concerns, soils, ecology,

28:45.939 --> 29:00.336
environment. There'll be more emphasis on 
integrating that. And hopefully a lot more

29:04.341 --> 29:09.049
cooperation between departments. You know, the 
department wall is a terrible barrier. Now we have

29:13.256 --> 29:18.606
the faculties across departments. I don't know. 
There's no easy answer to that kind of thing. If we

29:21.511 --> 29:24.636
could smooth out the barriers, that prevent 
faculty from interacting across departmental

29:25.004 --> 29:33.993
walls, and faculty walls, and college walls. It 
seems to be functioning better between

29:35.934 --> 29:44.082
universities than it can between right here on our 
own campus, in some instances. That's a big deal

29:44.122 --> 29:46.384
with Douglas. He's got us interacting more, but 
one can do it in two different things. What were

29:52.780 --> 30:03.331
your proudest moments in all these years as a 
faculty member here?

30:03.592 --> 30:17.607
I guess maybe getting a note from a student

30:03.592 --> 30:17.607
in whose life the note seems to say that you've had a 
very positive impact on them. Because I know how

30:18.211 --> 30:24.637
many people think they're going to have a note like 
that and never do. How many times I've thought

30:24.657 --> 30:29.162
about doing something like that and being good. So 
I think that would be my proudest moment is to get

30:30.003 --> 30:38.771
those favorable comments. And they're not a whole 
lot of them, but when you do get them, Question.

30:48.762 --> 30:54.447
Summarize what you have in your heart about what 
it's meant to you to be a faculty member here.

30:58.130 --> 31:01.693
Well, I feel just extremely fortunate and 
blessed. I mean, I couldn't have done what I love to

31:01.713 --> 31:06.698
do and got paid for it. Family's had a good living. 
It's been, I've felt that I've had wonderful

31:09.200 --> 31:17.007
support, a lot of opportunities to interact with 
literally thousands and thousands of students,

31:18.117 --> 31:23.807
both graduate and undergraduate.
