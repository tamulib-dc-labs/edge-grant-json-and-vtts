WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:02.043
delay. This is the Japanese revision. Let me tell 
you about Brunette Thorson's film collection.

00:21.006 --> 00:21.366
Okay. Now, here's what I'm interested in, really, 
is that there has been, as a matter of fact, over the

00:30.845 --> 00:45.003
last five or six years, almost, well, really since 
1957, since the IGY, has been an increased

00:30.845 --> 00:45.003
exchange of Soviet and American scientists upon 
international cruises. Cooperation in Moho, for

00:45.844 --> 00:50.891
example, and in working plate tectonics. Why your 
committee? Why now? Did that lead to an evolution

00:55.955 --> 01:05.069
of international cooperation so they thought 
that a group like you could ensure continued

00:55.955 --> 01:05.069
cooperation?

01:09.115 --> 01:11.538
Well, no, I don't think it was to ensure it. I think 
it was to expand it. A lot of the cooperation that

01:14.002 --> 01:24.257
you have mentioned has been limited to high seas, 
oceanographic vessel effort. There has not been

01:25.503 --> 01:29.970
much involvement at shore facilities. The 
occasional, yeah, but not as much. For example, I

01:33.796 --> 01:48.118
visited the Soviet Union as a guest of their 
academy in the fall of 74, going around the long

01:33.796 --> 01:48.118
way, taking a cruise ship of the Soviet Union from 
Yokohama.

01:52.992 --> 02:00.259
Okay, so I came into Nohodka, which is close to 
Vladivostok, but I'm not permitted to visit

01:52.992 --> 02:00.259
Vladivostok. I was the first U.S. scientist ever 
to visit that area, and as luck would have it, since

02:00.279 --> 02:21.379
it was the summer, there were perhaps 300 marine 
biology, oceanography people from all over the

02:00.279 --> 02:21.379
Soviet Union working at that laboratory.

02:22.287 --> 02:51.028
it was a fabulous opportunity to talk with people 
that you had never met maybe never will meet again

02:22.287 --> 02:51.028
but it developed for me a list of names and 
addresses with whom i can correspond some of whom i

02:22.287 --> 02:51.028
will undoubtedly see again but here is a 
tremendous block of the soviet scientific

02:22.287 --> 02:51.028
community that have never even seen a u.s 
scientist before and the same i think could be said

02:22.287 --> 02:51.028
for a sizable

02:53.793 --> 02:55.916
scientific community. Now, how were you tapped 
for this kind of committee assignment? Why did

03:03.367 --> 03:04.649
they pick you? Okay, I think it's pretty cut and 
dry. In 66, in part because of the earlier

03:06.592 --> 03:17.488
involvement, I had an opportunity to participate 
in the second international oceanographic

03:06.592 --> 03:17.488
congress, Moscow. I went, spent about a month in 
the Soviet Union, a portion of which was at the

03:20.033 --> 03:34.900
meetings in Moscow, and a portion was at the 
post-Congress tour of facilities on the Black

03:20.033 --> 03:34.900
Sea, Sevastopol, Sochi, Yalta. That gave me 
contact with Soviet scientists, and for the ten

03:37.104 --> 03:44.016
years that followed, I maintained these contacts 
through correspondence, exchange of scientific

03:44.688 --> 03:51.437
publications. In 72, at a meeting in Helgeland, 
which is Germany, another very, very influential

03:52.959 --> 04:11.082
gentleman in the realm of marine biology, not 
oceanography, Otto Kinnett, had invited three

03:52.959 --> 04:11.082
Soviet scientists as guests of the German 
Republic. Two of them were people that I had met at

04:14.405 --> 04:19.209
the 66th Oceanographic Congress. In the six or 
seven years that we had not seen each other, one of

04:19.229 --> 04:31.340
them had been kicked way upstairs as a member of the 
Soviet Academy of Sciences, a director of the new

04:19.229 --> 04:31.340
Far Eastern Institute of Marine Biology, 
Vladivostok. We spent some number of evenings

04:32.101 --> 04:35.604
catching each other up. And it was from that that I 
received the invitation to go there as their

04:37.205 --> 04:41.769
guest. And I assume that when this was known, And 
they were looking for US people to serve on these

04:44.628 --> 04:47.711
committees. My name just happened to come out of 
the computer. So all these things are so

04:52.856 --> 05:01.105
interrelated that sometimes it really defies the 
imagination.

05:01.125 --> 05:09.273
Do you anticipate, we were, actually you were 
spelling out goals, which your committee had in

05:01.125 --> 05:09.273
mind. And we don't, you had really only talked of 
one goal. Now,

05:14.058 --> 05:19.446
you're going to create subcommittees then. When 
do you anticipate subcommittees' reports with

05:19.667 --> 05:25.376
goals for a national corporation? One of the 
programs in that general biological

05:25.436 --> 05:39.778
productivity and biochemistry of the world's 
oceans is a section on the ecology of fouling

05:25.436 --> 05:39.778
communities, with which I am personally 
involved.

05:43.454 --> 05:50.784
The first of the workshops was scheduled for 
Beaufort, November 75. In spite of rather

05:51.725 --> 06:06.285
horrendous difficulties, which are the sort of 
thing that would make a good short story, a group of

05:51.725 --> 06:06.285
Soviet scientists came here. We had the workshop 
with about 22 US scientists. We, in addition to

06:12.293 --> 06:22.529
presenting, review papers from both sides to 
familiarize the other side with what's going on in

06:12.293 --> 06:22.529
the realm of the ecology of filing communities. 
There was a lot of after dinner discussions,

06:22.549 --> 06:35.989
individual chats, presentation of short 
scientific papers, and more importantly, a lot of

06:22.549 --> 06:35.989
talk about where should we go from here. One of the 
places that we are going from there is to Leningrad

06:37.150 --> 06:53.491
in late November 76 for a return workshop, which 
will do the reverse in the sense that it will take

06:37.150 --> 06:53.491
eight U.S. scientists to meet with about 30 Soviet 
scientists. In the year that they've had since the

06:53.511 --> 07:01.521
Beaufort meeting, they are encouraged to 
communicate with their Soviet counterparts

07:02.750 --> 07:11.783
begin to think on their own as to individual 
research and cooperative research projects that

07:02.750 --> 07:11.783
they feel should be attempted. The proceedings of 
that 75 workshop are to be published in the next six

07:13.486 --> 07:23.481
weeks by the Navy Printing Office in both 
languages. And as the first volume resulting from

07:24.282 --> 07:28.268
this whole program it will be widely distributed 
through the soviet union and the united states

07:28.619 --> 07:46.881
hopefully generating interest thoughts on 
research that some soviet might wish to do in this

07:28.619 --> 07:46.881
country and some u.s might wish to do in the soviet 
union at the November Leningrad meeting we will be

07:48.295 --> 08:17.610
more specific about okay now who is available from 
the scientific community to go to the Soviet Union

07:48.295 --> 08:17.610
during the summer months of 1977 and develop some 
sort of a cooperative research program either

07:48.295 --> 08:17.610
with a group from Leningrad or Moscow or 
Vladivostok and get the whole thing geared up so

07:48.295 --> 08:17.610
that it isn't one of these nebulous paper things 
but a whole series of reasonably well-organized

08:17.995 --> 08:23.620
individual efforts rather than a monstrous 
program. The language handicap, how great is it?

08:28.604 --> 08:34.329
It's serious, but less serious at the scientific 
level than at the political level. And you see this

08:36.371 --> 08:39.954
in discussions with the Soviets all the time. When 
the group came here in May for their working party

08:40.034 --> 08:44.998
meeting, they brought with them their own 
interpreter. We provided an interpreter also. In

08:49.282 --> 08:58.713
casual conversations about science, nobody 
seems to worry too much about whether I say

08:49.282 --> 08:58.713
mollusks or molluscans. But when it comes to 
formulating the protocol, then there was

08:59.815 --> 09:16.875
frequently a 15-minute discussion between their 
interpreter and our interpreter as to the nuances

08:59.815 --> 09:16.875
of the words that should be used, because it comes 
out as a Soviet version plus a US version, which

08:59.815 --> 09:16.875
must agree. But many of the Russians speak English 
far better than we speak Russian. It's standard

09:24.677 --> 09:32.011
procedure, I guess, through the academy that when 
you go there, you are provided with an

09:24.677 --> 09:32.011
interpreter. And it will take a long time before 
it's as comfortable as it is with, say, the people

09:32.031 --> 09:41.850
in the German scientific community. But it's 
moving in that direction. And the area that

09:44.811 --> 09:58.212
bothers me most is that there is a tremendous 
backlog of scientific literature in Russian that

09:44.811 --> 09:58.212
most US scientists have never seen and cannot 
read, even if they know it exists. Do you read and

09:58.232 --> 09:59.474
speak Russian? No. But at some point, we're going 
to have to tackle the problem of translating the

10:01.417 --> 10:08.408
significant works that can't do it all. And the big 
trick is to decide what's significant. and then

10:11.699 --> 10:16.726
proceed to translate it and print it and 
disseminate

10:11.699 --> 10:16.726
it. They do this all the time on a laboratory base, 
but we don't. Now, you were involved with the EPA in

10:22.234 --> 10:31.507
1975, too, on an Environmental Protection Agency 
conference on estuaries. Was this also in

10:33.230 --> 10:36.795
connection with your work in international 
cooperation? Would this overlap? Oh yeah,

10:39.915 --> 10:41.316
there's a lot of overlap.

10:45.600 --> 11:06.158
I don't know why I was selected to participate in 
that, but possibly because I have been involved in

10:45.600 --> 11:06.158
estuarine

10:45.600 --> 11:06.158
research for 25 years, so that I know a lot of the 
people who are

11:07.117 --> 11:10.140
concerned about environmental and estuarine 
pollution. And I guess I've published a lot on it,

11:10.760 --> 11:15.665
so it would be natural. Now, are you able to bring in 
your experience at international conferences

11:15.685 --> 11:22.712
and your discussion with your contemporaries and 
colleagues here? Oh, very definitely. And

11:24.573 --> 11:31.880
encourage them to the extent that they are so 
inclined to take advantage of the contacts that I

11:24.573 --> 11:31.880
have. And that's one of the reasons that I push much 
the amusement of some of my colleagues to bring to

11:35.230 --> 12:04.748
this laboratory scientists from all over the 
world either individually when they're coming

11:35.230 --> 12:04.748
through the United States or as a group like this 
Soviet working party meeting that's why I wanted

11:35.230 --> 12:04.748
it here so that they could chat with the members of 
the staff here and begin to develop whatever

11:35.230 --> 12:04.748
interests that they may have I have two or three 
technical questions and I want to turn back to

12:05.048 --> 12:06.149
cooperation, really. But what forms of life are 
first hit the hardest by shoreline pollution?

12:16.862 --> 12:18.784
Well, presumably the sessile form. Any of the 
shelf, well, not any of the shelf, the shrimps can

12:20.686 --> 12:28.995
move around, but the clams, the oysters, they 
can't get away from it. So they close up for a while,

12:29.616 --> 12:34.802
and if they can't stay closed up beyond a certain 
point, that's it. Now,

12:36.875 --> 12:48.412
the average American probably identifies 
Jacques Cousteau as the prominent oceanographer

12:36.875 --> 12:48.412
in the world. And this is the media's message. Now, 
in dealing as a scientist, and this is a very

12:51.837 --> 13:01.752
involved question I have here, but as a scientist 
dealing with pollution on shore, obviously

13:02.035 --> 13:05.719
shellfish are the first one to take the blows of 
pollutants. Do you feel yourself pressured

13:05.739 --> 13:18.232
between those people who identify with many of 
Cousteau's rash statements on one side and with

13:05.739 --> 13:18.232
private enterprise on the other, not anxious to 
protect the shellfish? Well, gee, first of all, I

13:20.495 --> 13:23.638
don't view Cousteau as a scientist. That's where 
the media have distorted the message. There is no

13:28.584 --> 13:29.865
doubt that He has done more for the realm of 
oceanography in the public eye than any other man,

13:31.330 --> 13:40.122
but as a promoter, not as a scientist. And this is 
why when he comes here and makes some of his

13:41.103 --> 13:54.722
sweeping generalities, it's hard to convince 
people within the Congress, say, that he is

13:41.103 --> 13:54.722
speaking as a promoter, not as a scientist.

13:59.360 --> 14:11.775
Sometimes the shock value of what he has had to say 
carries enough that you do see some results from

13:59.360 --> 14:11.775
it, even though what he said originally is 
debatable. And this is, of course, one of the

14:12.816 --> 14:15.239
problems in the scientific community. We're 
always arguing about the hairs of definitions of

14:15.279 --> 14:25.331
things as apart from the overviews that Cousteau 
takes. And in that sense, he undoubtedly has

14:29.144 --> 14:30.245
contributed a great deal. But I'm not sure I know. 
Pressured between private enterprise and

14:32.047 --> 14:36.131
Cousteau, I don't see it that way at all. Well, 
maybe my question was not phrased properly. I was

14:39.114 --> 14:58.273
saying that Cousteau, as what amounts to a 
naturalist promoter, tends to make these rash

14:39.114 --> 14:58.273
statements about the Mediterranean dying or the 
Red Sea will soon be gone or soon there will be no

14:39.114 --> 14:58.273
life in the ocean is the one that sticks in my mind, 
which stirs up, in particularly coastal states

14:39.114 --> 14:58.273
like yours, a great deal of opinion among 
environmentalists about what should be done. Do

15:01.263 --> 15:14.055
you feel a great deal of pressure as a man attached 
to an institution in this state like Duke

15:01.263 --> 15:14.055
University between these environmentalists 
spurred on by people like Cousteau and private

15:01.263 --> 15:14.055
enterprise, which has not won any records in North 
Carolina, by the way, for preserving the

15:01.263 --> 15:14.055
shoreline? That's a sore point. How do you react to 
that? What's your personal reaction to that? To

15:20.582 --> 15:22.543
these two different opinions? To this sort of 
pressure, this internal pressure, if there is

15:22.624 --> 15:26.147
such, created within your state itself. Well, 
without someone like Cousteau to influence the

15:27.700 --> 15:34.407
man in the street, it would be a losing cause. 
Because most scientists are not capable of

15:36.329 --> 15:44.437
conveying to the man in the street the real 
problems. They're too concerned about the

15:44.457 --> 15:46.319
details. They're not capable of putting it into 
language that people can understand. And it's

15:49.702 --> 15:55.868
going to be up to somebody like Cousteau and Ralph 
Nader to sufficiently aroused the public to

15:56.270 --> 16:03.920
permit the government to do some of the things that 
the scientific community thinks should be done.

16:06.163 --> 16:07.945
What sort of positive steps should we take?

16:11.029 --> 16:11.450
Well...

16:19.941 --> 16:25.568
I think the simplest initial step would be to 
enforce the laws that exist. We have a big fight

16:26.611 --> 16:31.515
right now in this county over coastal management. 
And the state in 72 passed, no in 74, passed the

16:31.535 --> 16:42.906
Coastal Management Act, which is modeled pretty 
much after the Federal Coastal Management Act of

16:31.535 --> 16:42.906
72. And they are now in the process of getting the 20 
coastal counties to organize a land use plan. This

16:48.751 --> 16:55.757
county, which ironically enough was the only 
county to support coastal management in 74, has

16:56.159 --> 17:24.259
now filed suit against the state declaring that 
the law is unconstitutional which means that in

16:56.159 --> 17:24.259
the meantime we're going to be without any sort of 
land use planning the county commissioners in

16:56.159 --> 17:24.259
yesterday's paper indicated that they intend to 
fill the void by starting a very thorough and

16:56.159 --> 17:24.259
exacting review of the existing ordinances in 
this county relative to the environment and to

16:56.159 --> 17:24.259
their enforcement Well, if they will do this, it 
may be a new day dawning, because right now there

17:24.948 --> 17:42.773
are flagrant violations of existing county 
ordinances on the use of septic tanks, for

17:24.948 --> 17:42.773
example, the development of trailer parks, and 
how many trailers can be attached to a septic tank.

17:43.494 --> 17:48.621
And if they will really enforce this, then we'll be 
a lot farther ahead. Well, the same thing can be

17:48.701 --> 17:53.368
said, I'm pretty sure, of all coastal states. to 
varying degrees. You pass a law to appease some

17:56.534 --> 18:00.501
group and then you forget it. You don't try to 
enforce it. So that would be a start. The other

18:04.007 --> 18:19.913
thing, at a higher level, I think the EPA is finally 
recognizing that you can't develop

18:04.007 --> 18:19.913
environmental constraints on estuaries as a 
whole. You've got to accept the fact that

18:20.399 --> 18:27.688
estuaries in Alaska are different from estuaries 
in Florida. And it's going to take a further

18:28.369 --> 18:47.352
subdivision of U.S. regional problems and then 
specific ordinances, laws, call them what you

18:28.369 --> 18:47.352
will, measures to deal with those problems in 
specific areas and not try to blanket Alaska and

18:28.369 --> 18:47.352
Florida. But none of this will come about if the 
public doesn't demand it, and if they don't

18:48.901 --> 19:05.550
realize that when scientists talk about the 
concern for the small fiddler crabs, they're not

18:48.901 --> 19:05.550
really expressing a value judgment of fiddler 
crabs against people. They're using the fiddler

19:06.172 --> 19:13.204
crabs as a barometer of the way in which the 
environment is going.

19:14.635 --> 19:24.128
that the corrective measures will have to be 
brought about because the public understands

19:14.635 --> 19:24.128
that this is what it is and insists that we clean it 
up. Yet somehow my view of oceanography is one

19:24.149 --> 19:38.549
which has been deeply involved with private 
enterprise and with the military as well as with

19:24.149 --> 19:38.549
practical sciences and impractical sciences, if 
I may use that word. Do you feel tensions within

19:39.851 --> 19:42.094
your profession? based upon this kind of 
cooperation?

19:48.407 --> 19:53.412
Well, I don't know of much involvement between 
private enterprise and oceanography. I was

19:53.432 --> 19:54.493
thinking about the oil industry. Well, that's 
almost exclusively geology. And geologists as a

19:58.537 --> 20:10.849
group, and they'll shoot me for it, but frequently 
geologists are not that concerned about the

19:58.537 --> 20:10.849
environment itself. They're more interested in 
the way in which it was formed, the way in which it

20:11.234 --> 20:14.940
evolves. It's an abstract, non-living system, so 
that they are not necessarily as attuned to the

20:15.681 --> 20:29.604
problems of pollution relative to biological 
systems. And I don't say that as a derogatory

20:29.624 --> 20:33.090
statement. I'm not that familiar with the

20:39.297 --> 20:47.207
But if you look at the realm of biological 
oceanography, there's very little involvement

20:39.297 --> 20:47.207
with private enterprise. In fact, none of my 
colleagues have jobs with private enterprise.

20:53.395 --> 21:01.946
Then, as far as you're concerned, scientists and 
EPA then, or what have you, could cooperate

20:53.395 --> 21:01.946
without any problems. Oh, yeah. Intellectually 
or financially or whatever. The only place we get

21:06.592 --> 21:09.135
in trouble are under political constraints. All 
right. Now, what do you say to the Russians then,

21:11.629 --> 21:20.880
back to where I left you, what do you say to the 
Russians then when they point out the problems of

21:11.629 --> 21:20.880
pollution you have at home? Do you ever discuss 
these sorts of things? They have the same problems

21:24.083 --> 21:25.625
at home, too. Okay. I was going to say, yeah, it 
would seem the Russians would say, how can you

21:26.967 --> 21:29.790
offer me advice? Look at what's occurring off of 
Louisiana, for example.

21:37.583 --> 21:43.071
The problems of pollution in the Soviet Union are 
almost identical to the problems of pollution in

21:37.583 --> 21:43.071
the United States. It's just a question of what you 
call the group that is contributing to the

21:44.093 --> 21:50.382
pollution. Over there, it's a collective 
something or other owned by the state. Over here,

21:55.790 --> 22:01.839
it is a private industry owned by the 
stockholders. But the results are the same. And

22:03.655 --> 22:06.879
the example that I always fall back on is Lake 
Baikal. Here is one of the oldest, deepest

22:07.019 --> 22:17.092
freshwater lakes in the world, full of all sorts of 
exotic fauna left over from the millennia gone by.

22:17.133 --> 22:25.984
And there is a very serious threat to the lake now 
because of industry, state industry. and there

22:26.453 --> 22:44.817
has been a local effort to drum up support for 
cleaning up Lake Baikal and a land use plan which

22:26.453 --> 22:44.817
will prevent any further industry from being 
situated on the banks of Lake Baikal and

22:26.453 --> 22:44.817
restrictive measures on what can be pumped in 
terms of effluents into Lake Baikal. All you have

22:44.837 --> 22:53.068
to do is substitute a certain number of titles and 
administrative units and you've got the same

22:44.837 --> 22:53.068
problem in North Carolina. You've got to put the 
stuff someplace. And it doesn't matter whether

22:56.812 --> 23:03.398
you're a communist state or a capitalist state, 
you're going to have problems when you start

22:56.812 --> 23:03.398
putting it into the natural environment. Now, you 
wouldn't see a mass demonstration in the streets

23:05.900 --> 23:14.588
of Moscow saying, down with state industries. 
That's the major difference.

23:22.015 --> 23:23.496
Do you think progress is being made? Definitely.

23:29.448 --> 23:35.577
But that's where some perspective in terms of 
history is useful, because man never progresses

23:29.448 --> 23:35.577
as fast as some people think he should. But 
locally, nationally, and internationally, you

23:36.399 --> 23:42.027
would adjudge progress to occur? Very definite. 
Well, let me say something. If you and I had been

23:47.796 --> 23:56.029
talking 10 years ago, let's say it's now August 
10th, 1967, 1966,

23:57.747 --> 24:04.373
Much of what we have discussed in the last 10 
minutes couldn't have been discussed because

23:57.747 --> 24:04.373
there wasn't any program, really. There wasn't 
any environmental protection agency. Only a few

24:07.296 --> 24:13.701
voices in the wilderness were beginning to say, we 
must do something about the environment. And the

24:14.482 --> 24:25.392
book Silent Spring, which was written basically 
right outside of this laboratory, was the first

24:14.482 --> 24:25.392
real recognition that we were in trouble. And I 
think it is really outstanding that in the last

24:25.692 --> 24:38.284
five years we have made the inroads and alerted the 
public and educated the public to the extent that

24:25.692 --> 24:38.284
we have done.

24:45.959 --> 24:49.764
when he, of course, as he turned out to be correct in 
almost every single point. It was the most amazing

24:49.784 --> 24:51.467
book I ever read. And when I asked him about it, he 
said, well, you've got to watch these people using

24:51.487 --> 24:55.772
scare tactics. And, of course, as you point out, 
now this conversation is just considered an

24:56.253 --> 25:04.945
important part of now international 
cooperation. Now, when did you first notice the

25:04.965 --> 25:10.332
environment becoming important on the 
international level? What were the first

25:10.352 --> 25:14.498
conferences you were involved in where this 
became the focal point of discussion?

25:19.321 --> 25:29.138
I guess it was the Rome meeting of FAO in 1970, and 
there it applied exclusively to the marine

25:19.321 --> 25:29.138
environment. I think that was the first really 
formal recognition that the topic received.

25:35.649 --> 25:41.599
There were some number of earlier national 
meetings, and you could go to a meeting in another

25:42.085 --> 25:47.110
country, say in 67 or 8, and people would be talking 
about it. But you would not have found that within

25:47.190 --> 25:58.901
the meeting there was a whole section devoted to 
environmental problems.

25:58.921 --> 26:05.267
Now, how did you come to organize a conference on 
land development of marine invertebrates in

25:58.921 --> 26:05.267
Yugoslavia? Well, you better change that title. 
It's larval development. I'm sorry, lowerable

26:10.013 --> 26:11.815
developments. Well, for several reasons. 
Yugoslavia at that time had PL-480 funds. And

26:23.505 --> 26:32.474
through my involvement with the Smithsonian, I 
knew of the machinery involved with PL-480 funds.

26:32.714 --> 26:37.118
So once I was off of the Biological Advisory 
Committee, where it wouldn't have been

26:37.688 --> 26:40.793
appropriate for me to submit a proposal on my own. I 
submitted a proposal as a member of the scientific

26:41.734 --> 26:51.669
community for such a conference because of my 
connections throughout the European scientific

26:41.734 --> 26:51.669
community. There was no real difficulty in 
generating enthusiasm and finding

26:51.910 --> 26:58.840
participants. And the same applied to the U.S. 
participants who went. I had long wanted to do a

27:05.836 --> 27:34.982
second larval conference we did one here in 67 and 
here was just about everything that was required

27:05.836 --> 27:34.982
for such a conference the facilities the interest 
and the financial support

27:05.836 --> 27:34.982
yugoslavia how would you rank yet in terms of a sign 
a comparison with western science well you can't

27:05.836 --> 27:34.982
label yugoslavia because it's a series of what 
five small states or varying sized states. And the

27:38.741 --> 27:44.811
degree of difference within these five is 
astronomical.

27:46.173 --> 27:51.742
In the northern area you have, for all practical 
purposes, western science. In the southern area,

27:52.403 --> 28:00.295
right next to Albania, the state of Montenegro, 
the understanding of science is about where it was

27:52.403 --> 28:00.295
in 1903.

28:02.452 --> 28:04.634
And then you have various gradations in between. 
The Split Institute of Oceanography, which is a

28:04.694 --> 28:16.866
major Yugoslav oceanographic institution,

28:04.694 --> 28:16.866
has some excellent people, some good equipment. 
They don't have the support that they would like,

28:17.346 --> 28:21.110
but that's true most places. Their interests are 
far more provincial in the sense that most of their

28:22.551 --> 28:31.800
emphasis is on either the Adriatic or 
Mediterranean, but that's understandable. They

28:34.254 --> 28:40.181
can't afford a monstrous international program, 
and there's no reason why they should feel they

28:34.254 --> 28:40.181
should.

28:43.004 --> 28:54.056
What a country like Yugoslavia, which I think we 
would consider underdeveloped in our terms,

28:43.004 --> 28:54.056
particularly in southern Yugoslavia, are they 
interested in such things as environmental

28:43.004 --> 28:54.056
controls too? Oh, very definitely, for very 
practical reasons. In a number of areas, They have

29:00.333 --> 29:07.461
developed some fantastic tourist facilities in 
response to domains on the part of the rest of

29:00.333 --> 29:07.461
Europe. And they're on a collision course in 
certain areas between industry and tourism,

29:08.883 --> 29:14.830
heavy industry. They're having problems with 
what to do with all the sewage produced by all the

29:15.811 --> 29:20.016
tourists. So they have very good everyday 
practical reasons why they need to know more about

29:21.398 --> 29:29.547
offshore currents, the effect of pollutants on 
the fauna, If they pollute the Adriatic, which

29:30.657 --> 29:37.552
wouldn't take that much, what little fishing they 
now have is down the drain. But, of course, it's a

29:38.333 --> 29:43.224
much more complicated situation in that the 
Yugoslavs don't get along too well with the

29:38.333 --> 29:43.224
Italians. The Italians have the beach across the 
hall, and the Italians have not been too concerned

29:43.725 --> 29:50.539
about polluting.
