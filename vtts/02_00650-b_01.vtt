WEBVTT

00:11.692 --> 00:19.321
Now, did the Navy interest you, and the Navy 
specifically contact you about trying to

00:11.692 --> 00:19.321
discover what happens to sound in the ocean? Yes, 
Ross and Bennett came out with the scripts. Talked

00:22.745 --> 00:24.507
to Spurrier, but Fleming and me. Okay, and how long 
did you work on that? Oh, quite a while. Okay. Did

00:28.893 --> 00:32.377
that carry on to when you began to work in the Navy in 
1941? Yeah. Okay. We didn't start until about

00:34.399 --> 00:36.281
1940. Oh, all right. Now, you said one time that the 
that the 1950s and 60s will be recorded as one of the

00:41.780 --> 00:48.409
great ages of exploration, for an exact quote. But 
it seems to me from your discussion here that the

00:48.450 --> 00:52.656
30s must have been a great age of exploration. What 
seems to you to be the difference in the two? The

00:57.062 --> 00:57.422
scale. The scale, okay. What major changes in 
technique would you suggest that occurred

01:00.447 --> 01:05.935
between the 50s and 60s and the 30s? The 
introduction of electronics.

01:13.167 --> 01:24.678
We used to have a saying in the 1930s, early 1940s, 
we wanted less than one vacuum tube per

01:13.167 --> 01:24.678
instrument.

01:24.738 --> 01:28.662
The great difference was really the development 
of instrumentation during World War II.

01:31.725 --> 01:38.652
In the 1950s and the 1960s, we were exploiting that

01:39.104 --> 01:46.173
Those great advances, not so much in actual 
instruments as in how to make instruments.

01:46.634 --> 01:51.200
And you think that the development of 
instrumentation came out of the work in the

01:46.634 --> 01:51.200
military services? Pretty largely, yeah. Now, 
I'm familiar with the work that came out of the Air

01:53.423 --> 02:02.095
Force School of Meteorology that develops 
between 1942 and 1945. It produced a goodly number

02:02.135 --> 02:04.438
of well-known oceanographers. What about the 
U.S. Navy? What would you suggest to be their major

02:07.758 --> 02:11.083
developments between 1941 and 1945? In

02:11.343 --> 02:16.772
what? In terms of instrumentation. Well, the main 
thing was the development of underwater sounds of

02:19.336 --> 02:36.482
all kinds, both

02:19.336 --> 02:36.482
echo sounders and horizontal ranging devices.

02:36.901 --> 02:42.809
great interest that developed in the Navy in the 
propagation of sound in the ocean. But there were

02:42.829 --> 03:06.739
also developments in what we call magnetometers, 
that is, methods of measuring various magnetic

02:42.829 --> 03:06.739
phenomena on the bottom and in the water by the 
so-called towed magnetometer, which really came

02:42.829 --> 03:06.739
out of the work on magnetic mines.

03:09.166 --> 03:13.891
Now, weren't you in the radio and sound lab in San 
Diego in 41 and 42? What exactly was your work

03:15.073 --> 03:16.675
there? Well, I was in a sailor's suit. I forgot to 
tell you that in 1934, I went on a cruise on the USS

03:22.301 --> 03:34.515
Bushnell, which is the flagship of the submarine 
force. It was just one submarine force, Atlantic

03:34.535 --> 03:38.059
and Pacific. And the Bushnell went up to Alaska, 
about halfway out on the Aleutian Islands, and

03:40.553 --> 03:51.207
then south to Hawaii. And I ran a line of 
oceanographic stations between the Aleutian

03:51.267 --> 04:07.928
Islands and the Hawaiian Islands, one of the first 
oceanographic sections across that part of the

03:51.267 --> 04:07.928
Pacific, really the first section across that 
part of the Pacific.

04:09.865 --> 04:16.110
This was primarily physical oceanography, as we 
used to call it, and chemical oceanography. That

04:16.931 --> 04:23.056
is, measurements of the silica, the oxygen, the 
nitrate, the phosphate, the temperature and

04:16.931 --> 04:23.056
salinity of the water.

04:27.300 --> 04:31.664
And it was those data that I went to Norway with in 
1936, 37. And

04:32.785 --> 04:39.771
as a result of this experience on the Bushnell,

04:42.147 --> 04:45.831
The captain of the ship was a man named Abel T. 
Bidwell. I remember his name. And I also remember

04:46.492 --> 04:47.893
the name of the admiral. His name was Cyrus W. Cole. 
This was a great experience in my life, this trip,

04:50.836 --> 04:55.401
this summer on this Navy ship. There were various 
other people on board. One was a man named Leo

04:59.846 --> 05:03.610
Bachmann. I remember him quite well. I don't 
remember the names of the others. Anyhow, Bidwell

05:09.535 --> 05:16.164
persuaded me to try for a Naval Reserve 
Commissioner, which I did, and I got that in 1936.

05:16.585 --> 05:37.433
So in 1941, when this Navy Radio and Sound Labs got 
started here in San Diego, and when the University

05:16.585 --> 05:37.433
of California Division of War Research was 
established there, I went on active duty and

05:16.585 --> 05:37.433
became a project officer for various kinds of 
things. Whereas Fairdrip and Fleming and Walter

05:38.223 --> 05:47.251
Monk and the others worked as civilians in the 
University of California in the Division of War

05:38.223 --> 05:47.251
Research.

05:51.175 --> 05:57.781
We had a

05:51.175 --> 05:57.781
skipper of the Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory. It 
was a martinet named Red Rubel. He was a real

06:02.626 --> 06:07.150
sundowner.

06:09.813 --> 06:13.497
This means various things to me, but in his case it 
meant he was a complete son of a pig. That's what it

06:14.878 --> 06:16.119
meant in the Army, sir. He was an impossible man. 
And I was on his staff.

06:26.930 --> 06:35.258
And he would send us, he would send me out with a 
group of chief petty officers and one or two

06:26.930 --> 06:35.258
scientists on various kinds of field 
expeditions. For example, in San Francisco Bay,

06:36.058 --> 06:39.702
we looked at the oceanographic conditions at the 
mouth of the Golden Gate, and then we did the same

06:40.323 --> 06:48.094
thing up at Neah Bay at the mouth of the Straits of 
Juan Fuca.

06:50.657 --> 06:59.029
Two of the scientists on those expeditions were 
Waldo Lyon, who has since become a great expert on

06:50.657 --> 06:59.029
the Arctic Oceanography. He was a physicist, a 
young physicist from UCLA, and a man named Jeffrey

07:00.611 --> 07:08.963
Holder, H-O-L-T-E-R, who was an idea man. He was a 
graduate student of physics, too. Idea men are a

07:20.936 --> 07:23.619
very peculiar breed, as you probably know. They 
have lots of ideas, and most of them are not very

07:24.801 --> 07:30.908
good, but some of them are very good. He was 
constantly interested in the original

07:30.928 --> 07:36.334
experiments of various kinds. Anyhow, we worked 
together on these surveys. Every time I came back

07:43.042 --> 07:46.566
to the survey, I found I had a different desk and a 
different job.

07:50.930 --> 07:54.553
And I got involved with radar propagation. I 
started a radar operator's school at the Navy

07:56.175 --> 08:07.165
Radio and Sound Laboratory, which later became 
the CIC school that still exists down here in San

07:56.175 --> 08:07.165
Diego. a great big establishment now, but it 
started with six scared, stupid, enlisted men who

08:07.583 --> 08:21.198
were sent by their skippers because they didn't 
know what else to do with them. To be our first

08:21.278 --> 08:22.799
class. They were just awful.

08:28.525 --> 08:32.410
But we decided we just couldn't teach guys like 
this how to operate radars. We'd have to have

08:33.130 --> 08:34.252
standards. So we insisted after that that We would 
only take people who had passed a certain score on

08:36.288 --> 08:42.957
the Navy's intelligence test. In fact, I've 
forgotten the name of it. But it wasn't called an

08:45.621 --> 08:48.485
intelligence test, but that's really what it was. 
And after that, they got better, and this thing

08:49.827 --> 08:52.571
really developed. After a while, it developed 
into a great big establishment.

08:59.761 --> 09:04.067
But this was, of course, a very dull job, teaching 
radar operators. to teach the same thing over and

09:04.756 --> 09:06.678
over again. And the one saving grace of it was that

09:08.179 --> 09:18.588
we would range on San Clemente Island. It's about 
70 miles west of San Diego. And sometimes you could

09:21.451 --> 09:23.372
see it, and sometimes you couldn't. And why was 
this?

09:28.977 --> 09:34.442
Well, it turned out, of course, the reason was that 
the radar beam was refracted by the structure of

09:28.977 --> 09:34.442
the atmosphere. Sometimes it was bent down. 
Sometimes it wasn't bent.

09:41.165 --> 09:44.568
And there were two good physicists who got 
involved with this. One was named Frank Abbott.

09:49.412 --> 09:58.280
And I

09:49.412 --> 09:58.280
can't think of the name of the other one. I know him 
very well. And of course, once they got into it,

10:01.163 --> 10:04.986
well, I had to fade away. I just didn't know enough, 
electromagnetic theory.

10:12.947 --> 10:18.156
That was one of the problems of being a geologist, 
was that you never really knew much about

10:12.947 --> 10:18.156
anything. But the first paper on radar 
propagation written out here was, I was one of the

10:18.176 --> 10:24.366
authors of that. And this, of course, has now 
become a science all by itself. This was in the, so I

10:30.496 --> 10:34.382
really got out of the, of the sound propagation 
study by getting involved with this radar school.

10:41.785 --> 10:56.843
And my friend, Rosson Bennett, by this time had 
gone to Washington as the head of the design branch

10:41.785 --> 10:56.843
of the electronics division of the Bureau of 
Ships.

10:56.863 --> 10:59.185
And I got in touch with him and said, I just got to get 
out of here. This is impossible. So he arranged for

11:03.310 --> 11:05.112
me to come to Washington. be assigned to the 
hydrographic office. This was in the winter of

11:09.983 --> 11:12.887
1942.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.414
I went out to the hydrographic office. The 
hydrographer was an old guy, a nice old admiral

11:19.396 --> 11:22.660
named Brian. Didn't really have any idea about 
World War II or what in the world an oceanographer

11:25.063 --> 11:29.229
could do. So he put me to work looking at a bank. that 
had been found somewhere off the coast of Panama.

11:41.713 --> 11:43.877
This bank was very interesting because it didn't 
exist. Some ships had picked it up on their

11:46.361 --> 11:50.507
bathometers, on their echo cylinders. And other 
ships passing over the same spot couldn't find it.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.238
Clearly, what it was was a deep scattering. But the 
guys out here were just finding out about the deep

11:59.581 --> 12:04.145
scattering layer at that time. Yeah, they were 
working out here in the Office of Naval Research.

12:08.469 --> 12:11.071
Oh, that was the University of California 
Division of War Research. Division of War

12:11.091 --> 12:12.332
Research, right. Russell Raitt and Martin 
Johnson, particularly. They did two great

12:16.636 --> 12:17.877
things. One was to find the deep scattering layer. 
The other was to, Martin Johnson, to solve the

12:21.301 --> 12:29.588
problem of crackle, the background noise that you 
got from mines. not front lines, but background

12:30.074 --> 12:38.763
noise that got into the sonar gear, which affected 
also acoustic lines.

12:41.485 --> 12:48.732
It turned out the way Martin did this was to ask, 
well, in fact, Martin was responsible for both

12:41.485 --> 12:48.732
these discoveries. In the case of the deep 
scattering layer, he asked the following

12:50.014 --> 12:59.043
question, what happens to it at night? And the And 
it turned out that at night it didn't exist. The

13:03.330 --> 13:11.420
scattering was just below the surface, not at 
depths of 100 or 200 meters. He said it must be due to

13:11.440 --> 13:15.625
organisms, because that's the way marine 
organisms behave. They go down in the daytime and

13:15.645 --> 13:17.268
up at night. And that, of course, is what turned out 
was right. In the case of the crackle, he said,

13:21.413 --> 13:26.119
where does it exist? And it didn't exist 
everywhere. It only existed over certain kinds of

13:28.545 --> 13:30.547
bottoms.

13:34.512 --> 13:46.646
And he said that he guessed that these must be an 
organism called a snapping shrimp, which lives in

13:34.512 --> 13:46.646
rocky bottoms and sandy bottoms, not in muddy 
bottoms. And he got some of these shrimp. He got one

13:48.008 --> 13:55.397
shrimp and put it in a little jar and put a 
microphone in the jar and called it a hydrophone

13:48.008 --> 13:55.397
because it's underwater.

14:03.089 --> 14:07.375
continuous popping noise like bacon fries. And 
clearly that was what it was. So these were two

14:11.039 --> 14:15.625
biological discoveries of very considerable 
interest.

14:19.050 --> 14:26.700
But

14:19.050 --> 14:26.700
anyhow, that was what Brian wanted me to do with 
this bank, this non-existent bank. I didn't think

14:28.402 --> 14:32.067
that was a very military thing to do.

14:38.965 --> 14:58.334
So I went back to Ross and Bennett, and he said, 
well, we'll give you additional duty in the Bureau

14:38.965 --> 14:58.334
of Ships,

14:38.965 --> 14:58.334
in the underwater sound section of the Bureau of 
Ships,

14:38.965 --> 14:58.334
the underwater sound section of the design branch 
of the electronics division of the Bureau of

14:38.965 --> 14:58.334
Ships. And I became code 940C, or 940D, I guess it 
was.

15:06.968 --> 15:07.909
My boss was a

15:11.129 --> 15:14.593
a man named Jacob Myers, a wonderful guy about my 
age. He was a commander, and I started out as a

15:15.113 --> 15:20.239
lieutenant and eventually became a commander 
myself.

15:23.582 --> 15:25.464
And we got along very well. I became the Bureau of 
Ships oceanographer, and I worked with all kinds

15:25.484 --> 15:32.592
of people. And I really became project officer for 
work that was being done at Woods Hole and at

15:32.712 --> 15:38.098
Scripps. the oceanographic work in radio and 
sound at the University of California Division of

15:38.500 --> 15:51.358
War Research, and the related work that was being 
done in New London in the underwater, a place

15:38.500 --> 15:51.358
called USNASL, U.S. Navy Underwater Sound Lab. 
Now, was Sir Edward Bullard involved in that? No,

15:53.561 --> 15:54.342
he was in England. I mean, the one in England. He was 
involved in many things, but the two principal

15:56.926 --> 16:07.140
things he did during the war were to work on 
acoustic, on the first on the magnetic minds, and

16:09.398 --> 16:15.846
then on acoustic minds, and finally on the 
so-called oyster mind. The oyster mind was a

16:17.188 --> 16:20.031
diabolical device. It still is diabolical.

16:24.016 --> 16:28.161
It depends upon the negative pressure wave made by 
the passage of a ship. And you can't sweep it. The

16:31.686 --> 16:33.768
only thing that was sweepable set it off as a ship. 
So you could sweep it by dragging the ship along.

16:46.878 --> 16:54.907
And the other thing he was involved with was the 
operating research business.

16:54.967 --> 17:04.198
He's a first-rate physicist, and had done a lot of 
geophysical work even before the war,

16:54.967 --> 17:04.198
measurements of gravity and measurements of 
magnitude. I would say that he's probably the

17:06.241 --> 17:11.767
greatest living geophysicist.

17:11.787 --> 17:15.872
But anyhow, I never met him during the war at all. We 
did come in contact with George Deacon, my group. I

17:23.080 --> 17:37.323
worked very closely with a man named Lyman 
Spitzer, who is now a professor of astronomy at

17:23.080 --> 17:37.323
Princeton, and after the war went into the 
thermonuclear fusion business. He's a very, very

17:37.343 --> 17:40.568
able man. He has an IQ about 40 points higher than 
mine.

17:48.050 --> 17:51.753
No problem was too difficult for him. He was 
fantastic. And he had something called the

17:53.295 --> 17:58.960
Underwater Sonar Analysis Group, which was part 
of the NDRC. And I was his opposite number in the

18:00.221 --> 18:04.845
Bureau of Ships. So we worked very closely 
together for many years, all during the war and

18:04.865 --> 18:10.570
after the war. Out here at Scripps, or at UCDWR, 
rather, I worked with Carl Eckhardt, who was also a

18:19.775 --> 18:38.179
first-rate

18:19.775 --> 18:38.179
physicist. He was a theoretical physicist. Like 
so many theoretical physicists in the 1920s, who

18:41.863 --> 18:49.393
started in the 1920s, he came very close to to 
winning a Nobel Prize, but didn't. Because these

18:52.953 --> 18:55.959
guys were all in competition with each other in 
Germany. Somebody else came up with the

18:56.940 --> 19:01.750
publication a few weeks before he did. But up until 
1941, he was a professor of theoretical physics at

19:03.172 --> 19:12.951
the University of Chicago. His student was 
Leonard Lieberman. He's still on the faculty of

19:15.867 --> 19:18.689
Scripps. Carl Eckhardt himself died two years 
ago,

19:18.709 --> 19:26.616
three years ago. And Eckhardt really 
revolutionized the underwater sound business by

19:26.636 --> 19:34.423
treating it statistically rather than by this ray 
theory of ours. I don't think I understand that.

19:39.508 --> 19:42.010
What's the difference between a ray theory and a 
statistic treatment? In the ray theory, we

19:43.711 --> 19:55.012
essentially assumed that the sound waves 
followed a path, a single path.

19:55.032 --> 19:57.937
And the ray is essentially at right angles to the 
wave. You can trace the path of the wave by drawing a

19:57.957 --> 20:00.522
ray.

20:17.731 --> 20:19.774
That gives you some useful insights. But 
statistical theory was more powerful because, in

20:19.834 --> 20:27.666
fact, the ocean is so complicated. The problems of 
reverberation, for example, the problems of

20:27.686 --> 20:45.612
background noise, the problems of scattering, 
and of absorption of sound are all related to the

20:27.686 --> 20:45.612
microstructure of the ocean as well as to the 
macrostructure.

20:47.600 --> 20:57.876
The best way to study these things is to look at the 
statistics, that is, what's the frequency of

20:47.600 --> 20:57.876
different events.

21:01.601 --> 21:07.170
You study reverberation, what's the pattern of 
reverberation, statistical pattern, and time.

21:08.111 --> 21:11.076
One of the great advantages of this is that you can 
integrate over time.

21:17.047 --> 21:41.653
He was a,

21:17.047 --> 21:41.653
he'd written a famous paper,

21:17.047 --> 21:41.653
what he called Irreversible Thermodynamics,

21:17.047 --> 21:41.653
which he dealt with phenomena of this general 
kind, phenomena of hydrodynamic, thermodynamic

21:17.047 --> 21:41.653
phenomena.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.234
And this was written actually before the war. And 
his interest really shifted then from nuclear

21:51.237 --> 22:00.550
physics and atomic physics to this field of 
hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. And he made

22:01.752 --> 22:09.182
great contributions into the theory of it,

22:01.752 --> 22:09.182
but never very much to the end. And to some extent to 
the practice, too. He wrote a classical. series of

22:15.721 --> 22:22.570
volumes after the war on the propagation of 
underwater sound, right after the war. Still,

22:22.590 --> 22:35.548
probably the most important book ever written on 
the subject, series of books, written for the

22:22.590 --> 22:35.548
NDRC,

22:22.590 --> 22:35.548
National Defense Research Committee. And there 
were a lot of people down there at the CDWR who were

22:37.611 --> 22:43.399
developing instrumentation and had ideas of 
various kinds about the various kinds of energy in

22:44.392 --> 22:52.524
the ocean. One of the amusing stories was that when 
we were first there, it was full of hot shots from

22:52.544 --> 23:03.961
the physics department at Berkeley, led by Ernest 
Lawrence. They had McMillan and a

23:03.981 --> 23:09.910
whole group of people. Lawrence had the idea that 
these damned ocean arguments were stupid, which

23:10.514 --> 23:14.902
they were. And the thing to do instead of fooling 
around with sound, as we had been doing, was to just

23:14.962 --> 23:28.248
get a big light underwater and he'd see us up there. 
And his idea was that What we'd been doing is

23:33.380 --> 23:38.787
fooling around with things that were too small and 
too inexpensive. If you just got a big enough

23:38.867 --> 23:41.931
light, you'd be able to see a long way. So they 
started a whole optical group down at DC, at DWR,

23:43.032 --> 23:58.611
under his direction, or at least his inspiration, 
headed actually by a man named Ike Bowen of

23:43.032 --> 23:58.611
Caltech, who was the later director of the a very 
nice, competent man. And they built this huge

24:04.147 --> 24:09.133
searchlight with millions of candle power. And 
they had a black sock 20 feet across and a couple

24:09.153 --> 24:17.162
hundred feet long to be a sort of imitation 
submarine. And the problem was how far it went. And

24:18.424 --> 24:21.407
then they tested out the searchlight. Well, you 
could see this sock about 20 feet short.

24:27.835 --> 24:30.317
Well, Lawrence decided maybe this wasn't such a 
good idea. The problem, of course, was that the

24:32.399 --> 24:40.066
scattering of light in the water created so much 
background that you didn't get any contrast. But

24:42.488 --> 24:48.073
they made a lot of studies of the propagation of 
light and the transmission of light in the ocean.

24:50.575 --> 24:54.079
And they had several problems which we 
oceanographers thought we could help them with.

24:54.939 --> 24:55.420
And we could. One of the problems was the damn 
instruments leaked. Of course, they'd never done

24:59.206 --> 25:02.791
any work on this. It's really a very difficult 
condition of salt water and pressure, high

25:02.871 --> 25:13.865
pressure, highly corrosive water. And so they'd 
lower the thing in the water and ruin everything.

25:21.996 --> 25:23.758
They'd have to take it out and start all over again. 
Finally, they got them so they wouldn't leak. And

25:26.802 --> 25:29.145
they went out and made a series of measurements 
about 50 miles offshore here and measured the

25:30.931 --> 25:37.640
transmission at different depths. And the guy 
that did it was a man named Malcolm Henderson. He

25:44.348 --> 25:46.932
said, OK, we measured the transmission of light in 
the seawater. And Sverdrup and I said, well, why

25:49.315 --> 25:52.178
don't you go over here and try it again? We knew we 
were on the inside of a front. Well, he finally did,

25:59.416 --> 26:02.199
and of course, he got completely different 
results. There's no relationship at all between

26:04.201 --> 26:10.669
the two, between the set two series of 
measurements. And so the next conclusion was you

26:10.689 --> 26:15.675
can't measure the transmission of light and see 
why it's too variable. So we said, well, now you go

26:15.775 --> 26:19.779
over here, and you'll find it's like it was the 
first time. You go there, and you'll find it like it

26:19.819 --> 26:25.626
was the second time, which of course was true, more 
or less. But anyhow, they had kind of lost interest

26:27.327 --> 26:35.077
in us because this damn sock didn't work very well. 
And then anyhow,

26:35.097 --> 26:44.530
all these hot shots disappeared all of a sudden. 
And we had heard that they went to a place called

26:44.550 --> 26:47.794
Shangri-La.

26:51.439 --> 26:56.305
And this was, of course, Los Alamos, as we found out 
after the war.

27:07.608 --> 27:10.551
still quite a few physicists left and quite a few 
engineers left. And they worked for years on a mine

27:10.571 --> 27:14.154
detecting. One of the big things they did was work 
on a mine detecting sonar. Well, they didn't start

27:18.918 --> 27:20.080
out that way. They started out with what they 
called variable frequency sonar, essentially

27:20.100 --> 27:24.984
frequency modulated sonar. And it turned out that 
this might be useful in detecting mines. And we had

27:31.510 --> 27:34.993
a submarine force had a real problem. They 
couldn't get it to the Japan Sea. because the

27:39.316 --> 27:48.289
Japanese had planted floating mines in Tsushima 
Strait and the other strait between Hokkaido and

27:39.316 --> 27:48.289
Honshu.

27:52.034 --> 28:04.372
And

27:52.034 --> 28:04.372
all during the war until the summer of 1945, none of 
our submarines ever went into the Japanese sea.

28:04.392 --> 28:08.698
But finally, we and the Bureau of Ships, in this 
section I'm telling you about, the underwater

28:10.012 --> 28:22.674
sound section, managed to get 12 submarines 
equipped with these sonars developed here at San

28:10.012 --> 28:22.674
Diego, at the UCDWR. And they did go into the Japan 
Sea.

28:31.008 --> 28:32.391
And this is the irony of it. By that time, the Japan 
Sea was essentially empty. They sank 25,000 tons

28:37.062 --> 28:40.046
of shipping and lost a submarine. And what had 
happened was that the oyster mines had been

28:41.869 --> 28:47.456
planted in all the Japanese harbors. And it 
essentially just stopped. All traffic back and

28:50.280 --> 28:53.986
forth from then showed up. These were planted by 
the 29th Bomb Com, the 29th Bomber Command, flying

28:54.006 --> 29:04.260
up from Marianas.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.563
And they dropped these mines in the harbors. I was 
at the harbors, and the Japanese just couldn't get

29:06.914 --> 29:10.630
through them.
