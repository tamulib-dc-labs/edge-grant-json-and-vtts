00:02.157 --> 00:08.967
Maxine was kind of, Maxine Davenport, Emanuel's then wife, was kind of den mother to the philosophy department.

00:10.229 --> 00:11.571
And we all had parties.

00:12.152 --> 00:13.394
Every weekend we had parties.

00:14.395 --> 00:18.341
And they were lovely long parties where there was a lot of drinking going on.

00:18.822 --> 00:30.679
And people brought their kids and they set them out in play pens under the trees and around six o'clock somebody would go out for fried chicken and sometimes a party would last from noon until two in the morning.

00:31.739 --> 00:36.885
And we would talk about philosophical issues and literary issues as well as local things.

00:36.905 --> 00:38.967
In fact, more than local things.

00:40.329 --> 00:41.670
And so it was really a good time.

00:42.651 --> 00:49.539
There were always, it was not just the 10 of us, because each of these people had an attachment.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.884
It was other people who were interested in philosophy.

00:54.505 --> 01:01.493
I would say there would be about 16 at each of these things.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.864
And this went on for quite a while.

01:05.984 --> 01:13.985
And Manuel Davenport was very enthusiastic about kind of philosophy for ordinary people.

01:14.005 --> 01:16.832
That was his shtick.

01:18.550 --> 01:28.982
So we would get in really good discussions in which everyone took part, as opposed to now you get to a philosophy group, and it's always very specialized, the discussion.

01:29.023 --> 01:35.050
So people cannot participate unless they are, unless they know the language, walk the walk, talk the talk, and so forth.

01:35.070 --> 01:36.011
It wasn't that way then.

01:36.031 --> 01:38.554
It was open discussion.

01:38.754 --> 01:42.338
Anybody who had an interest could easily get into the discussion.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.282
Manuel did interesting things.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.865
For instance, he joined Mensa.

01:49.145 --> 01:53.412
And then he suggested to Hugh that Hugh would be an appropriate member for Mensa too.

01:53.792 --> 01:56.356
And so I got irritated and I said, well, what about me?

01:56.457 --> 01:57.538
I'm going to join this group too.

01:57.558 --> 02:03.628
So we went down to Austin to take the intelligence test, which was really goofy.

02:04.369 --> 02:05.511
And we joined Mensa.

02:05.872 --> 02:07.494
And then Manuel had Mensa parties.

02:08.356 --> 02:09.658
And these were really fun.

02:09.678 --> 02:12.041
There'd be a couple of Aggies, sometimes in uniform.

02:12.943 --> 02:14.325
There would be...

02:15.554 --> 02:20.940
some brilliant person who never had a chance to get out of a restrictive life.

02:21.741 --> 02:29.250
There would be a handful of people from the university, and these people would go over to his house, and he'd provide refreshments, and we'd talk about stuff.

02:29.270 --> 02:35.857
So this was kind of when the philosophy department got a little bit tired of one another, and this was a way of refreshing it.

02:36.438 --> 02:42.945
But one thing I noticed is that he always had these chess sets and so forth set out so that anybody who wanted to can indulge in

02:43.297 --> 02:46.082
in this kind of thing, but nobody ever touched any of this stuff.

02:46.102 --> 02:47.484
There were puzzles, chess sets.

02:48.806 --> 02:52.051
People just talked, and there was gossip too at these things.

02:52.171 --> 02:58.281
I didn't think they were that much different from the regular philosophy parties, but there was less alcohol because there were students.

02:58.922 --> 03:04.191
I think we had beer, and that was it.

03:04.762 --> 03:06.945
Manuel always had some project.

03:07.266 --> 03:11.472
He did a lot of work for the BCLU.

03:12.194 --> 03:13.896
He was active in the Unitarian Church.

03:14.758 --> 03:16.260
He was a wonderful auctioneer.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.624
They were always auctioning stuff off for benefits.

03:19.525 --> 03:22.650
And Manuel was just great at that.

03:24.012 --> 03:29.841
And so I remember those first few years actually in a kind of beery haze, but very pleasant.

03:30.648 --> 03:32.934
with Manuel at the helm of the philosophy department.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.962
And officially he was the department head.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.692
Did he operate as a department head or department chair?

03:40.113 --> 03:43.763
He operated as a department chair because he did everything democratically.

03:44.924 --> 03:50.793
And I believe that was an all Anglo male department.

03:50.933 --> 03:51.394
Yes, it was.

03:51.454 --> 03:53.257
It was indeed.

03:53.277 --> 03:54.158
Okay.

03:54.178 --> 03:57.523
All right, now back over then you in the English department.

03:57.924 --> 04:03.753
When did you and your husband begin to be invited to English department events?

04:05.435 --> 04:13.007
Well, that's hard to say because they didn't have, they didn't party.

04:14.523 --> 04:18.530
For one thing, there was a much greater age spread.

04:21.074 --> 04:32.554
I guess there was an age spread in philosophy too, actually, from Becca to Hugh, but there wasn't such an age spread as there was in English.

04:33.014 --> 04:36.540
Some people always invited me to their parties.

04:38.003 --> 04:39.906
Harry Kreuter, for instance.

04:41.540 --> 04:46.586
I would, I guess I would generalize and say that people who were having wild parties included me in.

04:48.408 --> 04:54.175
Philosophy department parties had a reputation, so they figured that I'd be up for, game for their parties too.

04:54.195 --> 04:57.839
But the older faculty members did not have these parties.

04:57.899 --> 05:03.286
They had dinners with their friends and they didn't socialize throughout the department.

05:04.547 --> 05:09.353
Did you have any impression of President Earl Rudder?

05:09.923 --> 05:11.265
If so, please describe.

05:11.986 --> 05:20.036
I never, in fact, there was one, one of the things that philosophy people used to do was to get together on Friday afternoons at a restaurant.

05:20.136 --> 05:22.760
And there was one that Earl Rudder was going to join us, but he didn't.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.242
Something came up at the last minute.

05:24.262 --> 05:25.143
So I never met the man.

05:26.364 --> 05:27.986
Other than that.

05:28.547 --> 05:36.117
But you must have seen him at some campus events where he presided.

05:37.244 --> 05:40.488
I didn't usually attend these events then.

05:40.508 --> 05:44.973
Anything whole campus, I usually steered clear of, and still do if I possibly can.

05:46.895 --> 05:58.469
But I remember thinking it was interesting that a military man should be in that post, and that this place was really very military.

05:58.489 --> 06:00.671
There was a lot of junk going on then.

06:00.771 --> 06:05.817
For instance, the Memorial Student Center Grass

06:06.016 --> 06:09.903
There were actually fights having to do with walking on the grass.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.449
I was kind of anti-military.

06:13.609 --> 06:16.214
I participated in the moratorium.

06:18.317 --> 06:24.989
But I didn't really connect this anti-military feeling about the war to Rudder because, of course, that wasn't his war.

06:26.191 --> 06:29.897
So I would say I did not really have much of an impression of him.

06:31.109 --> 06:36.716
Did you notice early on Aggie traditions?

06:37.477 --> 06:37.897
Did you?

06:37.917 --> 06:38.318
Oh, yes.

06:39.139 --> 06:39.279
Uh-huh.

06:39.299 --> 06:39.800
Which ones?

06:40.440 --> 06:42.423
Well, first of all, there was a business about the lawn.

06:42.523 --> 06:43.544
Then there was bonfire.

06:43.564 --> 06:48.050
I attended bonfire at that time.

06:49.291 --> 06:55.058
There was, when we passed on hence to David Stewart,

06:56.489 --> 07:03.840
David Stewart had the, for some reason, the urge to kind of force traditions on everybody.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.903
He made people go to Yale practice, for instance.

07:06.024 --> 07:08.407
I thought Yale practice a totally disgusting tradition.

07:08.808 --> 07:21.467
It's kind of funny that I should have participated in so many parties and not like Yale practice, but Yale practice seemed to me just out of control.

07:23.405 --> 07:27.910
There was an article in the Texas Observer about the Corps some years ago.

07:29.471 --> 07:31.253
And I remember reading that.

07:31.273 --> 07:38.061
This was very anti-Corps, really, but it had all the pictures of all the traditions.

07:38.121 --> 07:40.523
And I remember thinking, gee, this is really a crazy place to be.

07:41.945 --> 07:49.733
But I was never either strongly for or I was not an anti-tradition person.

07:50.202 --> 07:53.408
On the other hand, there are quite a few traditions that I didn't really buy into.

07:56.614 --> 07:57.977
All right.

07:57.997 --> 08:02.004
Jack Williams came as president in late 1970.

08:03.347 --> 08:07.855
Did you see him, form an impression of him in his early years?

08:12.664 --> 08:13.746
I do remember him.

08:18.383 --> 08:33.366
But the fact of the matter is that the presidency of the university and the chancellor seemed so remote for me that I didn't... I was interested in the administration up so far as the dean.

08:33.626 --> 08:35.529
After that, it didn't matter to me.

08:36.992 --> 08:38.434
Your impression of the dean.

08:38.634 --> 08:39.595
Yeah.

08:39.616 --> 08:39.956
Okay.

08:41.058 --> 08:41.819
Well, let's see.

08:41.859 --> 08:42.961
Which dean are we talking about?

08:43.562 --> 08:43.722
Maxwell.

08:43.742 --> 08:44.183
Maxwell.

08:44.243 --> 08:45.304
I like Maxwell very much.

08:45.745 --> 08:45.825
Why?

08:46.801 --> 08:50.085
Maxwell was a very humane person.

08:51.126 --> 08:57.735
And one of the things he did, I don't know if you're going to want to leave this on or not, but I'm going to say it.

08:58.035 --> 09:09.109
One of the things he did was to collect up drunken professors in his truck and return them to their homes before they could do too much damage to themselves or for that matter.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.811
What do you mean if they were at a party or something?

09:10.831 --> 09:15.036
If they were at bars and he would get a call and he'd go out with his red truck

09:15.218 --> 09:19.123
and pick this guy up and haul him home.

09:20.885 --> 09:39.249
He was the person who was responsible for my staying and not getting the boot when all of a sudden this place got into the notion of competitive competition and making sure that only scholars were in the English department and this sort of thing.

09:40.331 --> 09:45.057
And Maxwell made it clear to Stewart that I was in

09:45.560 --> 09:50.406
When did you become a full-time faculty member?

09:50.766 --> 09:53.690
Well, see, that's what's strange.

09:53.970 --> 09:56.674
I was hired as an instructor.

09:57.535 --> 09:59.617
And then I was hired annually as an instructor.

10:00.819 --> 10:08.468
And then I was demoted to lecture about three years after I was, and this, Maxwell did this.

10:08.488 --> 10:14.335
He demoted all of us, everybody except me, however, who was demoted, was a student.

10:16.880 --> 10:22.507
And then Harrison Hearth was head.

10:24.430 --> 10:27.694
And Harrison said, well, why don't you finish your PhD?

10:27.914 --> 10:30.197
And then we could get you, we could keep you.

10:30.838 --> 10:31.319
So I did.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.044
I went back to Pitt and it only took me about six months.

10:35.785 --> 10:39.049
I got the thing out of the way and got the degree.

10:39.890 --> 10:43.815
And so I was put back on the tenure track.

10:45.736 --> 10:47.397
This is in the 70s.

10:48.258 --> 10:48.599
Yes.

10:49.059 --> 10:52.202
I was put back on the tenure track, I believe, in 75.

10:52.582 --> 10:53.903
I got the degree in 74.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.507
But I don't remember the sequence.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.890
What I don't have is the sequence of who was department head when.

11:01.910 --> 11:05.253
I know that Hearth was very supportive to me and Dave Stewart was not.

11:06.495 --> 11:11.859
In fact, the first thing he did was to rail at me.

11:11.899 --> 11:13.701
He called me in when he took over.

11:14.153 --> 11:20.805
And he railed at me that my file in his office had nothing in it.

11:23.468 --> 11:29.539
That is, there were no, there was no dossier, there was no recommendation, there was nothing.

11:30.661 --> 11:31.783
He said, where are you from?

11:31.843 --> 11:33.405
This is an empty folder.

11:33.425 --> 11:36.892
And I said, you know, I didn't put together the folder.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.997
So then I collected up all this stuff that he wanted in it.

11:40.738 --> 11:44.565
But he seemed to think that I had done some...

11:44.545 --> 11:50.534
some terrible thing, put something over on him that I probably really didn't have a Master's from the University of Pittsburgh at all.

11:50.895 --> 11:56.483
But we collected the stuff and we got it together and Stuart's and my relationship was not ever wonderful.

11:58.526 --> 12:01.591
And by then you're teaching what courses?

12:01.972 --> 12:03.274
I'm still teaching the same courses.

12:04.996 --> 12:06.619
I taught those same courses.

12:09.223 --> 12:10.705
There weren't any other courses.

12:11.360 --> 12:15.307
On the undergraduate level, there were just a handful of specialized courses.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.154
And I didn't start teaching.

12:20.897 --> 12:28.230
I'm trying to remember, there was all of a sudden a tremendous surge in courses.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.701
And then, of course, I taught all kinds of courses.

12:34.968 --> 12:39.654
I was on the undergraduate committee for a while, for instance, and it was murder to get a course through there.

12:39.815 --> 12:47.064
You couldn't, you know, people would put courses through two or three years in a row and they would be stopped.

12:47.545 --> 12:48.586
In the department?

12:48.626 --> 12:49.828
In the department, yeah.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.831
What was the reason for there being?

12:53.573 --> 12:54.334
I don't remember.

12:57.498 --> 12:59.541
But it wasn't just you?

13:00.398 --> 13:02.960
I didn't offer courses.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.883
I was on the undergraduate committee that looked at these course proposals.

13:06.163 --> 13:25.480
And the head would say, no, we can't use this one because it's not with that one because.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.081
And nothing would go through.

13:26.101 --> 13:27.122
And then all of a sudden, it was whatever you want.

13:27.142 --> 13:29.143
Under Jack Williams, the female enrollment exploded upward, and so did the totem.

13:29.163 --> 13:29.684
How did this prevent that?

13:29.704 --> 13:29.764
OK.

13:30.554 --> 13:48.556
There were, they hired a lot of lecturers.

13:48.576 --> 13:48.856
When was this?

13:48.876 --> 13:49.096
In the 70s.

13:49.116 --> 13:49.336
In the 70s.

13:49.356 --> 13:50.017
What part of the 70s do you know?

13:50.037 --> 13:50.898
See, when he came in, he came here in 1971.

13:50.918 --> 13:51.018
Okay.

13:51.038 --> 13:57.026
First time women were admitted to the undergraduate program without any description.

13:57.106 --> 13:57.326
Yeah, okay.

13:57.346 --> 13:57.967
At one point they had a dean.

13:57.987 --> 13:58.768
And her name was Toby Schreiber.

13:58.848 --> 13:59.869
Right there.

14:02.633 --> 14:13.735
She used to have what certainly looked like tea parties in the bottom of... Now, what is the name of that building?

14:14.276 --> 14:20.227
Where... The one?

14:20.648 --> 14:23.815
No, the building with the glass bottom is new, relatively new.

14:24.115 --> 14:25.097
It's got two parts.

14:27.322 --> 14:32.249
One is sixth floor and has the dean on top, and then the... It's just... Oh, Harrington.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.030
Yeah, right, okay.

14:33.050 --> 14:36.235
She used to have these tea parties in Harrington.

14:36.315 --> 14:39.099
You'd see her in there with all these women drinking tea.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.644
So they added dean of women.

14:43.885 --> 14:50.815
Then, after there were many women, I started to get women coming to me with problems.

14:53.495 --> 14:56.719
The explosion of students resulted in the hiring of a lot of lecturers.

14:56.820 --> 15:10.338
And we had just, what was interesting too is that I was then demoted, but the lecturers, the male lecturers, made more money than the women.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.246
Even if many of them were there for only one year.

15:16.487 --> 15:18.209
And some of them were really strange people.

15:18.870 --> 15:22.675
You had the feeling that somebody went out with a van and hauled in lecturers.

15:23.060 --> 15:46.043
But these people would come and go, and I was there, and then... I don't know how it affected me personally, except that I had more people in my classes, and there were more women, and I did have women asking me questions other than that.

15:47.505 --> 15:49.687
You said women ask you questions came for advice.

15:49.827 --> 15:50.788
About what?

15:51.578 --> 15:56.786
What were the letters that women... It came to me about being harassed by male students.

15:57.387 --> 15:58.448
That was the biggest one.

15:59.069 --> 16:00.952
And then sexism in classrooms.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.861
And there were some people who were taught in such a way as to be really insulting to women.

16:06.901 --> 16:09.525
And some of them, I think, didn't even think about it.

16:09.545 --> 16:10.406
They'd just been doing this.

16:10.426 --> 16:11.608
They made the same jokes.

16:12.329 --> 16:15.714
They would, for instance, they would joke about rape all the time.

16:15.754 --> 16:17.957
The women didn't like that.

16:19.810 --> 16:23.154
And women came to ask me what should they do?

16:23.194 --> 16:32.967
How should they deal with either sexist instructors or student harassment?

16:34.028 --> 16:36.111
What advice did you give them?

16:36.131 --> 16:37.212
It depended on the case.

16:37.753 --> 16:43.320
In one or two cases, I recommended that the student drop the course.

16:44.617 --> 16:49.545
I recommended that complaints be written to deans and this course be dropped.

16:49.685 --> 16:50.146
I don't know.

16:50.506 --> 16:51.969
She did drop the class.

16:52.029 --> 16:53.351
I don't know whether she complained or not.

16:54.313 --> 17:05.651
The students that were being harassed, I recommended that, in one case, that legal action be taken.

17:06.512 --> 17:08.295
In other cases,

17:09.220 --> 17:15.549
When it wasn't severe, I just told her to be a little bit more assertive about telling the guy to get lost.

17:16.491 --> 17:24.843
Were there some people in that era that you consider very positive in their sensitivity to women's matters?

17:25.945 --> 17:28.308
In the department, let's see.

17:33.316 --> 17:33.456
Hmm.

17:41.468 --> 17:46.796
Well, there was Stanley Archer who was always able to figure out the right thing to do and do it.

17:48.097 --> 17:48.919
Was he deceased?

17:49.139 --> 17:49.399
Yes.

17:49.820 --> 17:50.341
Oh, boy.

17:50.921 --> 17:54.066
He died, yeah, and he would have been a wonderful repository.

17:54.086 --> 17:56.990
Have you talked to Clint Mahan?

17:57.811 --> 17:58.072
Who?

17:58.092 --> 18:05.182
Clint Mahan, M-A-C-H-A-N-N, because Clint was a student here, I believe, when I came as an instructor, and now he's a professor.

18:05.823 --> 18:06.263
In English?

18:06.464 --> 18:06.704
Yes.

18:07.505 --> 18:09.568
No, I don't know him.

18:11.320 --> 18:16.631
But yes, Stanley was wonderfully sensitive to just about any matter of decorum.

18:17.954 --> 18:19.176
And he always did the right thing.

18:20.479 --> 18:22.764
He was universally liked too.

18:23.966 --> 18:25.329
What about campus wide?

18:25.389 --> 18:32.063
Were there any people to whom a young woman could go for help, advice, words?

18:42.809 --> 19:11.922
I'm trying to think of what women there were there then, and the only name that comes to mind is Betty Underberger, and I didn't know her.

19:12.661 --> 19:19.590
In the 70s, did you, you women faculty members didn't get together, I gather.

19:20.431 --> 19:31.444
Well, I liked, there was a woman here when I came here, a linguist, and I liked her very much, and she loved the linguist.

19:31.464 --> 19:32.065
We did not get together.

19:32.125 --> 19:37.572
There was, and when the women did start to get together, when it was, when the women faculty network

19:39.644 --> 19:44.048
It didn't seem very relevant to me, so I never really participated in that.

19:44.068 --> 19:45.489
But that was years and years later.

19:45.529 --> 19:50.173
There may have been, but I don't remember.

19:50.213 --> 19:51.034
There was a group.

19:51.434 --> 20:04.385
So, for instance, there was a group within the English department of men who always drank together.

20:04.405 --> 20:05.807
And women were definitely not invited.

20:05.827 --> 20:07.248
And a lot of departments' business were transacted with these meetings.

20:07.268 --> 20:07.708
And this was not good.

20:07.728 --> 20:08.689
Now, I was not, at this time, a Penitrax member.

20:09.209 --> 20:32.578
So it didn't affect me, but there were, by this time, women can attack people.

20:32.598 --> 20:33.399
And they greatly objected to this group.

20:33.419 --> 20:33.559
Behind.

20:33.579 --> 20:36.042
All right, now by the late 70s, Dr. Williams has gone, Dr. Miller's back, and you began to become a growing female at home.

20:36.062 --> 20:37.444
Did you and others begin to think that the Texas A&M was on the move?

20:39.213 --> 20:53.070
Yes, but when the women first started to really increase the numbers, the inequities were very difficult.

20:55.126 --> 21:12.026
Well, the fact that women did not tend to be welcome in many of the sciences, and I had students complain to me about that.

21:12.046 --> 21:20.557
They said that they were in English in part because they proceeded rudely and this, that, and the other.

21:20.577 --> 21:21.278
There were so few women professors.

21:21.298 --> 21:22.399
And again, especially when they did have

21:31.053 --> 21:45.758
Let me get the change.

21:45.778 --> 21:46.159
I don't know where.

22:18.674 --> 22:30.084
And no one really wanted A&M to be tremendously behind the times.

22:30.424 --> 22:39.833
So I would say there was effort made by the administration to be more in tune with what was happening other places.

22:41.314 --> 22:47.179
I don't know, I don't recall incidents or individuals that marked

22:49.403 --> 22:51.866
I do know that the core was especially recalcitrant.

22:51.926 --> 22:53.888
I had Melanie Zentgraft in class.

22:54.108 --> 22:56.451
She was in my argumentation class, and she was very good.

22:57.352 --> 22:59.935
Please describe her as well as you know her.

22:59.955 --> 23:05.642
Well, this was a long time ago, and she was a very incisive thinker.

23:06.422 --> 23:08.485
She wrote excellent papers.

23:08.525 --> 23:19.157
She didn't ever go overboard in what she did, but she'd always give kind of bare-bones arguments that were very cogent.

23:20.605 --> 23:50.224
her papers were always in on time her attitude in class was good she was assertive without being aggressive in class and that was a time there was a time and that was part of this this was during that time when women tended to be silent in class did she was not did you ever see any evidence of anyone any male student picking on her

23:50.879 --> 23:51.841
In class?

23:52.201 --> 23:52.422
No.

23:53.524 --> 23:54.145
I didn't see that.

23:55.127 --> 23:55.347
All right.

23:55.808 --> 23:57.331
This is a note to the typist.

23:57.712 --> 23:59.435
This will go in as an editorial note.

24:00.236 --> 24:14.322
I was dean of faculties at this time, and this is the last commencement that I attended before going in the summer of 1980 to become the new president at the University of Texas at El Paso.

24:14.302 --> 24:19.188
This is the last commencement in May of 1980.

24:20.430 --> 24:27.539
We then had commencements on Friday afternoon, Friday night, and Saturday morning.

24:27.639 --> 24:29.541
This is the Saturday morning commencement.

24:31.624 --> 24:38.993
NM students then and now graduate in alphabetical order by college, by major, and by last name.

24:40.458 --> 24:52.135
Melanie Zentgraf's undergraduate major was biomedical science, which is the only undergraduate major in the College of Veterinary Medicine.

24:52.155 --> 25:03.171
So she was the last student, because of her last name, beginning with the letter Z, from the last college, and that was the third commencement.

25:03.352 --> 25:07.798
Her family, I learned later, had thought that we had deliberately rigged it

25:08.318 --> 25:10.945
so that she would be the last of the last of the last.

25:11.006 --> 25:12.109
That part is not true.

25:13.613 --> 25:23.340
Our commencement speaker at that event was William P. Hobby, Jr., the Lieutenant Governor, Bill Hobby from Houston.

25:23.320 --> 25:33.331
And while the diplomas are being passed out, Lieutenant Governor Hobby motioned to me to come up from my seat on about three rows behind him and sit next to him.

25:33.431 --> 25:42.662
And he told me that when I got out to UTEP to stay in contact, I should stay in contact with him, that he would try to help me since we'd known each other for about 20 years.

25:43.503 --> 25:48.889
And he said such marvelous things as maybe I can help UTEP with a special item or something or other.

25:49.662 --> 26:00.674
As I began to note that we were about to finish the commencement, I was starting to get up from my seat and go back to the back row when I heard some hissing.

26:00.695 --> 26:02.336
I turned to him and said, oh my goodness.

26:02.356 --> 26:02.997
He said, what is it?

26:03.057 --> 26:10.185
I said, I don't know, but there are some people out there hissing, which means they're mad about something, and particularly the Corps members.

26:10.686 --> 26:16.112
And I turned to my right, and I saw that Melanie Zentgraf was about to come up on the stage.

26:16.152 --> 26:18.775
And I said, oh my goodness, here comes Melanie Zentgraf.

26:18.755 --> 26:21.742
He said, gee, my niece, she's really pestered me.

26:22.263 --> 26:23.246
She's been a pain.

26:23.366 --> 26:24.108
She's come over.

26:24.188 --> 26:25.170
She's written letters.

26:26.113 --> 26:36.257
Melanie's problem was that she had wanted to be on the fish drill team, in the A&M band, in the Ross Volunteers, and for all three of those,

26:36.237 --> 26:46.306
hopes she had gotten lame excuses and had been not allowed to compete for one of those positions.

26:46.326 --> 26:56.375
The point of this editorial note is that within two or three feet of where I was seated, she came up to receive her diploma.

26:57.156 --> 26:59.238
President Jarvis Miller handed it to her.

26:59.318 --> 27:03.662
She took it in her right hand, shifted it to her left hand,

27:03.642 --> 27:11.371
then extended her right hand to him, and he very quietly said, no way, I'm going to shake your hand.

27:13.374 --> 27:19.421
The lieutenant governor and I and many, many people in the audience kind of held our breath and gasped a bit.

27:20.482 --> 27:27.270
She then turned to Bob Lacey, the registrar who was handing the diplomas to President Miller,

27:28.229 --> 27:31.974
being sure that he handed the right diploma to him at the right time.

27:32.554 --> 27:37.581
She extended her hand to Mr. Lacey, and Mr. Lacey said, ma'am, I'm not involved in this argument.

27:39.103 --> 27:48.014
She then turned to Don Carter, who was then on the staff of the registrar, and he said, ma'am, let's keep the line moving.

27:48.134 --> 27:55.283
So she went off stage, and being the last degree recipient, everyone noticed it.

27:55.263 --> 27:56.444
Paragraph.

27:57.906 --> 28:17.170
About six weeks later, when Dr. Miller was summoned over to a special meeting of the Board of Regents, he walked in and they announced to him that he had been terminated effective that day at five o'clock, that he'd been terminated as president.

28:17.858 --> 28:28.612
They read him a statement, and the first thing I understand that they said to him on an ad lib basis was, you refuse to shake hands with an Aggie graduate.

28:30.795 --> 28:37.504
Melanie Zintgraf is a person whose role at A&M is symbolically very important.

28:37.484 --> 28:56.335
important because she did not receive fair treatment particularly on that day and the person making this statement learned that you shake hands with every student and give every student at least the credit that they deserve.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.699
I thought that's a good one to add there.

28:58.679 --> 28:59.781
That's interesting.

28:59.961 --> 29:02.867
Academically, was she a good student?

29:02.887 --> 29:05.491
Yeah, she got an A and without a lot of work.

29:05.732 --> 29:10.260
That class though was unusual then in that there was only one Corps member in it.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.045
I do remember that because of this issue.

29:14.988 --> 29:22.662
And the other students seemed to like Melanie and there was also I believe there was kind of an anti-Corps feeling in that class.

29:23.215 --> 29:26.201
which she may have had something to do with, but I don't know.

29:26.301 --> 29:29.567
But I just remember this one corps guy on the end seat and Melanie in the front row.

29:29.587 --> 29:33.093
And we never discussed issues having to do with the corps.

29:33.113 --> 29:40.026
It was an argumentation class, but we discussed gun control and capital punishment and abortion and all these other old chestnuts.

29:40.006 --> 29:49.959
And then we got into things like polygraphs and like that, topics that I like better because you don't have to listen to the same old arguments over again.

29:50.700 --> 29:58.150
But she was a good student, and she seemed to have the class's respect, and I liked her.

29:59.672 --> 30:05.440
As I understand it, her mother, natural mother and stepmother, both...

30:06.500 --> 30:10.726
were physically handicapped in terms of walking and so forth.

30:11.848 --> 30:22.323
And their father was a bird colonel in the Air Force, and therefore she had grown up in an atmosphere and you ought to be allowed to achieve everything that you can achieve.

30:22.684 --> 30:26.509
So that she wouldn't back down from a competition.

30:29.334 --> 30:32.338
In the 80s and 90s, how did A&M change?

30:34.057 --> 30:35.762
How did the English department change?

30:35.882 --> 30:37.106
How did the campus change?

30:37.608 --> 30:44.067
Okay, I'm trying to kind of link changes to dates and I can't.

30:46.493 --> 30:56.182
When David Stewart took over the headship, he had this kind of notion of the department as promoting service, as being a service department primarily.

30:56.382 --> 31:02.188
And he saw, as he put it, cadres of instructors teaching technical writing.

31:03.669 --> 31:05.571
And most of us didn't like this.

31:05.971 --> 31:08.053
Most of us thought this was a really bad idea.

31:09.234 --> 31:15.100
And yet, despite the fact that this was his vision, it was under his leadership that
