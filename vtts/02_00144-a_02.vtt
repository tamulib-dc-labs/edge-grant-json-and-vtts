WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:08.984
Maxine was kind of, Maxine Davenport, Emmanuel's 
then wife, was kind of den mother to the philosophy

00:02.174 --> 00:08.984
department. And we all had parties. Every weekend 
we had parties. And they were lovely long parties

00:14.412 --> 00:18.378
where there was a lot of drinking going on. And 
people brought their kids and they set them out in

00:18.839 --> 00:24.727
play pens under the trees. And around 6 o'clock 
somebody would go out for fried chicken. And

00:27.852 --> 00:30.696
sometimes a party would last from noon until 2 in 
the morning. And we would talk about

00:31.756 --> 00:36.782
philosophical issues and literary issues as well 
as local things. In fact, more than local things.

00:40.366 --> 00:41.687
And so it was really a good time. There were always, 
it was not just the 10 of us, because each of these

00:44.110 --> 00:49.556
people had an attachment. It was other people who 
were interested in philosophy. I

00:54.642 --> 01:01.510
would say there would be about 16 at each of these 
things.

01:04.257 --> 01:05.921
And this went on for quite a while. And Manuel 
Davenport was very enthusiastic about kind of

01:06.001 --> 01:13.358
philosophy for ordinary people. That was his 
shtick.

01:18.584 --> 01:35.085
So we would get in really good discussions in which 
everyone took part, as opposed to now you get to a

01:18.584 --> 01:35.085
philosophy group and it's always very 
specialized, the discussion, so people cannot

01:18.584 --> 01:35.085
participate unless they are, unless they know the 
language, walk the walk, talk the talk, and so

01:18.584 --> 01:35.085
forth. It wasn't that way then. It was open 
discussion. Anybody who had an interest could

01:38.770 --> 01:42.375
easily get into the discussion. Manuel did 
interesting things. For instance, he joined

01:45.339 --> 01:47.882
Mensa. And then he suggested to Hugh that Hugh 
would be an appropriate member for Mensa, too. And

01:53.828 --> 01:56.391
so I got irritated and I said, well, what about me? 
I'm going to join this group, too. So we went down to

01:57.592 --> 02:03.660
Austin to take the intelligence test, which was 
really goofy. And we joined Mensa. And then Manuel

02:05.903 --> 02:07.485
had Mensa parties. And these were really fun. 
There would be a couple of Aggies, sometimes in

02:09.707 --> 02:12.030
uniform. There would be... some brilliant person 
who never had a chance to get out of a restrictive

02:15.571 --> 02:20.959
life. There would be a handful of people from the 
university, and these people would go over to his

02:21.700 --> 02:29.051
house and provide refreshments, and we'd talk 
about stuff. So this was kind of when the

02:29.291 --> 02:33.698
philosophy department got a little bit tired of 
one another. And this was a way of refreshing it.

02:36.427 --> 02:44.678
But one thing I noticed is that he always had these 
chess sets and so forth set out so that anybody who

02:36.427 --> 02:44.678
wanted to can indulge in this kind of thing. But 
nobody ever touched any of this stuff. There were

02:46.140 --> 02:47.522
puzzles, chess sets. People just talked. And 
there was gossip, too, at these things. I didn't

02:52.209 --> 02:55.253
think they were that much different from the 
regular philosophy parties. But there was less

02:55.333 --> 02:58.317
alcohol because there were students. I think we 
had beer. And that was it. Manuel always had some

03:04.795 --> 03:06.978
project. He did a lot of work for the BCLU. He was 
active in the Unitarian Church. He was a wonderful

03:14.791 --> 03:16.293
auctioneer. They were always auctioning stuff 
off for benefits. And Manuel was just great at

03:19.539 --> 03:22.684
that. And so I remember those first few years 
actually in a kind of beery haze, but very

03:24.046 --> 03:29.875
pleasantly. was manual at the helm of the 
philosophy department and officially he was the

03:30.665 --> 03:57.685
department head did he operate as a department 
head or department chair he operated as a

03:30.665 --> 03:57.685
department chair because he did everything 
democratically uh...

03:30.665 --> 03:57.685
and now that i believe that was an all anglo male 
department yes it was it was indeed right now back

03:30.665 --> 03:57.685
over then you in the english department When did 
you and your husband begin to be invited to English

03:57.833 --> 04:05.424
department events? Well, that's hard to say 
because they didn't have, they didn't party.

04:16.159 --> 04:18.583
For one thing, there was a much greater age spread. 
I guess there was an age spread in philosophy, too,

04:21.106 --> 04:24.972
actually, from Becca... to Hugh, but there wasn't 
such an age spread as there was in English. Some

04:33.004 --> 04:36.567
people always invited me to their parties. Harry 
Kreuter, for instance. I guess I would generalize

04:42.052 --> 04:46.616
and say that people who were having wild parties 
included me in. Philosophy department parties

04:48.437 --> 04:54.202
had a reputation, so they figured that I'd be a game 
for their parties, too. But the older faculty

04:54.222 --> 04:56.224
members did not have these parties. They had 
dinners with their friends, and they didn't

04:57.900 --> 05:03.286
socialize throughout the department. Did you 
have any impression of President Earl Rudder? If

05:09.233 --> 05:11.315
so, please describe. I never... In fact, there was 
one... One of the things that philosophy people

05:12.837 --> 05:22.989
used to do was to get together on Friday afternoons 
at a restaurant, and there was one that Earl Rudder

05:12.837 --> 05:22.989
was going to join us, but he didn't. Something came 
up at the last minute, so I never met the man. Other

05:26.073 --> 05:28.016
than that... But you must have seen him at some 
campus events where he presided. I didn't usually

05:36.046 --> 05:40.492
attend these events then. Anything whole campus, 
I usually steered clear of and still do if I

05:40.552 --> 05:45.018
possibly can. But

05:46.920 --> 05:55.692
I remember thinking it was interesting that a 
military man should be in that post. and that this

05:56.482 --> 05:58.464
place was really very military. There was a lot of 
junk going on then. For instance, the Memorial

06:00.767 --> 06:09.939
Student Center grass, there were actually fights 
having to do with walking on the grass. I was kind of

06:11.841 --> 06:13.483
anti-military. I participated in the 
moratorium, but I didn't really connect this

06:13.644 --> 06:25.138
anti-military feeling about the war to Rutter 
because, of course, that wasn't his war. So I would

06:25.844 --> 06:31.189
say I did not really have much of an impression of 
them. Did you notice early on Aggie traditions?

06:37.534 --> 06:38.375
Oh, yes. Which ones? Well, first of all, there was 
the business about the lawn. Then there was

06:42.539 --> 06:43.580
Bonfire. I attended Bonfire at that time. There 
was... When we passed on heads to David Stewart...

06:56.506 --> 07:03.877
David Stewart had the, for some reason, the urge to 
kind of force traditions on everybody. He made

07:03.897 --> 07:05.900
people go to Yale practice, for instance. I 
thought Yale practice a totally disgusting

07:06.041 --> 07:08.444
tradition. It's kind of funny that I should have 
participated in so many parties

07:08.825 --> 07:21.484
and not like Yale practice, but Yale practice 
seemed to me just out of control.

07:23.438 --> 07:27.923
There was an article in the Texas Observer about 
the core some years ago. And I remember reading

07:29.505 --> 07:31.247
that. This was very anti-core,

07:31.307 --> 07:35.972
really. But it had all the pictures of all the 
traditions. And I remember thinking, gee, this is

07:38.154 --> 07:40.537
really a crazy place to be. But I was never either 
strongly for or I was not an anti-tradition

07:41.978 --> 07:49.767
person. On the other hand, there are quite a few 
traditions that I didn't really buy into.

07:56.649 --> 07:58.012
All right. Jack Williams came as president in late 
1970. Did you see him, form an impression of him in

08:03.360 --> 08:07.867
his early years?

08:12.695 --> 08:13.797
I do remember him.

08:18.417 --> 08:26.746
But the fact of the matter is that the presidency of 
the university and the chancellor seemed so

08:18.417 --> 08:26.746
remote for me that I didn't... I was interested in 
the administration up so far as the dean. After

08:33.654 --> 08:35.556
that, it didn't matter to me. Your impression of 
the dean? Yeah. Okay. Well, let's see. Which dean

08:41.863 --> 08:42.964
are we talking about? Maxwell. I like Maxwell very 
much. Why? Maxwell was a very humane person. And

08:51.164 --> 08:57.774
one of the things he did, I don't know if you're 
going to want to leave this on or not, but I'm going

08:51.164 --> 08:57.774
to say it. One of the things he did was to collect up 
drunken professors in his truck and return them to

08:58.095 --> 09:09.131
their homes before they could do too much damage to 
themselves or for that matter. What do you mean if

09:09.171 --> 09:10.834
they were at a party or something? If they were at 
bars and he would get a call and he'd go out with his

09:10.854 --> 09:15.120
red truck and pick this guy up and haul him home. He 
was the person who was responsible for my staying

09:19.457 --> 09:39.278
and not getting the boot when all of a sudden this 
place got into the notion of competitive

09:19.457 --> 09:39.278
competition and making sure that only scholars 
were in the English department and this sort of

09:19.457 --> 09:39.278
thing. And Maxwell made it clear to Stuart that I 
was in. Now, when did you become a full-time

09:45.577 --> 09:50.442
faculty member? Well, see, that's what's 
strange. I was hired as an instructor, and then I

09:53.986 --> 09:59.632
was hired annually as an instructor. And then I was 
demoted to lecturer about three years after I

10:00.833 --> 10:08.482
was... And this, Maxwell did this. He demoted all 
of us, everybody, except me, however, who was

10:08.522 --> 10:14.368
demoted, was a student.

10:16.913 --> 10:22.522
And then Harrison

10:16.913 --> 10:22.522
Hurth was head. And Harrison said, well, why don't 
you finish your PhD? And then we could keep you. So I

10:30.875 --> 10:31.356
did. I went back to Pitt. It only took me about six 
months. I got the thing out of the way and got the

10:35.803 --> 10:39.088
degree. And so I was put back on the tenure track.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.412
Now, this is in the 70s. Yes. I was put back on the 
tenure track, I believe, in 75. I got the degree in

10:52.617 --> 10:53.918
74.

10:57.101 --> 10:58.543
But I don't remember the sequence. What I don't 
have is the sequence of who was department head

10:58.563 --> 11:01.906
when. I know that Hearth was very supportive to me 
and Dave Stewart was not. In fact, the first thing

11:06.531 --> 11:11.876
he did was to rail at me. He called me in when he took 
over. And he railed at me that my file in his office

11:14.187 --> 11:20.856
had nothing in it. That is, there was no dossier, 
there was no recommendation, there was nothing.

11:30.696 --> 11:31.818
He said, where are you from? This is an empty 
folder. And I said, well, you know, I didn't put

11:33.461 --> 11:36.887
together the folder. So then I collected up all the 
stuff that he wanted in it. But he seemed to think

11:40.755 --> 11:44.582
that I had done something wrong. some terrible 
thing, put something over on him that I probably

11:44.562 --> 11:50.550
really didn't have a master's from the University 
of Pittsburgh at all. But we collected the stuff

11:50.930 --> 11:53.334
and we got it together. And Stuart's and my 
relationship was not ever wonderful. And by then

11:58.541 --> 12:01.605
you're teaching what courses? I'm still teaching 
the same courses. I taught those same courses.

12:09.235 --> 12:10.376
There weren't any other courses. Mm-hmm. on the 
undergraduate level there were just a handful of

12:11.377 --> 12:34.566
specialized courses and I didn't start teaching 
I'm trying to remember there was all of a sudden a

12:11.377 --> 12:34.566
tremendous surge in courses

12:11.377 --> 12:34.566
and then of course I taught all kinds of courses but 
I was on the undergraduate committee for a while,

12:35.002 --> 12:39.670
for instance, and it was murder to get a course 
through there. You couldn't, you know, people

12:39.850 --> 12:47.082
would put courses through two or three years in a 
row, and they would be stopped. In the department?

12:48.664 --> 12:49.866
In the department, yeah. What was the reason for 
their being... I don't remember.

12:57.539 --> 12:59.642
But it wasn't just yours, that's... I didn't offer 
courses. I was on the undergraduate committee

13:03.022 --> 13:05.905
that looked at these course proposals. And the 
head

13:06.185 --> 13:25.423
would say, no, we can't use this one because, 
because, and nothing would go through. And then

13:25.443 --> 13:26.464
all of a sudden, it was whatever you want. Under 
Jack Williams, the female enrollment exploded

13:26.484 --> 13:28.126
upward, and so did the totals. How did this prevent 
that from happening? OK. There were, they hired a

13:30.588 --> 13:49.026
lot of

13:30.588 --> 13:49.026
lecturers.

13:49.046 --> 13:49.327
When was this? In the 70s. In the 70s. What part of 
the 70s? See, when he came in, he came here in 1971.

13:51.148 --> 13:51.248
Okay. First time women were admitted to the 
undergrad program without any instruction.

13:57.254 --> 13:57.515
Yeah, okay. At one point, they had a dean. Her name 
was Toby Schreiber, right?

14:02.667 --> 14:13.724
She used to have, certainly looked like tea 
parties, in the bottom of, now what is the name of

14:02.667 --> 14:13.724
that building? The Y?

14:19.933 --> 14:22.337
No, the building with the glass bottom. It's new, 
relatively new. It's got two parts.

14:27.685 --> 14:30.649
One is sixth floor and has the dean on top, and then 
the... It's just... Oh, Harrington. Yeah, right,

14:32.329 --> 14:33.050
okay. She used to have these tea parties in 
Harrington. You'd see her in there with all these

14:36.335 --> 14:39.119
women drinking tea. So the editing of women. Then, 
after there were many women, I started to get women

14:43.905 --> 14:49.313
coming to me with problems.

14:53.699 --> 15:00.028
The explosion of students resulted in the hiring 
of a lot of lecturers, and we had just... What was

15:00.363 --> 15:10.334
interesting too is that I was then demoted, but the 
lecturers, the male lecturers, made more money

15:00.363 --> 15:10.334
than the women.

15:14.159 --> 15:18.203
Even if many of them were there for only one year, 
and some of them were really strange people. You

15:18.884 --> 15:22.428
had the feeling that somebody went out with a van 
and hauled in lecturers. But these people would

15:24.451 --> 15:29.256
come and go, and I was there, and then...

15:35.294 --> 15:46.066
I don't know how it affected me personally, except 
that I had more people in my classes, and there were

15:35.294 --> 15:46.066
more women, and I did have women asking me 
questions other than that. You said women asking

15:46.366 --> 15:49.670
you questions came for advice. About what? What 
were the matters that women... It came to me about

15:54.575 --> 15:56.837
being harassed by male students. That was the 
biggest one. And then sexism in classrooms. And

16:02.716 --> 16:06.882
there were some people who were taught in such a way 
as to be really insulting to women. And some of

16:06.902 --> 16:09.526
them, I think, didn't even think about it. They'd 
just been doing this. They made the same jokes. For

16:12.730 --> 16:15.715
instance, they would joke about rape all the time. 
The women didn't like that. And women came to ask

16:17.737 --> 16:26.530
me, what should they do?

16:28.045 --> 16:32.989
How should they deal with either sexist 
instructors or student harassment? What advice

16:34.150 --> 16:36.112
did you give them? It depended on the case. In one or 
two cases, I recommended that the student drop the

16:37.753 --> 16:43.238
course. I recommended that complaints be written 
to deans and this course be dropped. I don't know.

16:50.545 --> 16:51.986
She did drop the class. I don't know whether she 
complained or not. The students that were being

16:54.728 --> 16:56.770
harassed, I recommended that

16:57.543 --> 17:05.654
in one case that legal action be taken. In other 
cases, when it wasn't severe, I just told her to be a

17:06.515 --> 17:15.587
little bit more assertive about telling the guy to 
get lost. Were there some people in that era that

17:16.528 --> 17:24.799
you consider very positive in their sensitivity 
to women's matters? In the department, let's see.

17:33.236 --> 17:41.568
Hmm.

17:41.588 --> 17:46.836
Well, there was Stanley Archer, who was always 
able to figure out the right thing to do and do it.

17:48.218 --> 17:48.959
Now, is he deceased? Yes. Oh, boy. He died, yeah, 
and he would have been a wonderful repository.

17:54.027 --> 17:54.347
Yeah, yeah. Have you talked to Clint Mahan? Who? 
Clint Mahan, M-A-C-H-A-N-N. Because Clint was a

17:58.100 --> 18:05.149
student here, I believe, when I came as an 
instructor, and now he's a professor. In English?

18:06.471 --> 18:06.731
Yes. Oh, no, I don't know him.

18:11.497 --> 18:19.207
But yes, Stanley was wonderfully sensitive to 
just about any matter of decorum, and he always did

18:11.497 --> 18:19.207
the right thing. He was universally liked, too. 
What about campus-wide? Were there any people to

18:25.385 --> 18:32.094
whom a young woman could go for help, advice, 
guidance?

18:51.921 --> 18:52.802
A lot of women went to all women's hospital. I'm

18:53.423 --> 19:08.605
trying

18:53.423 --> 19:08.605
to think of what women there were there then. And 
the only name that comes to mind is Betty

19:08.765 --> 19:14.133
Underburger, and I didn't know her. In the 70s, did 
you women faculty members didn't get together, I

19:14.333 --> 19:19.701
gather?

19:22.381 --> 19:44.131
It

19:22.381 --> 19:44.131
didn't seem very relevant to me, so I never really 
participated in that. That was years and years

19:44.171 --> 19:45.533
later. There may have been, but I don't remember. 
There was a group. department of men who always

19:53.363 --> 19:55.908
drank together. And women were definitely not 
invited. And a lot of the department's business

19:58.673 --> 20:04.404
was kind of transacted with these women. And this 
was not good. Now, I was not, at this time, a tenure

20:05.786 --> 20:09.493
track member. So it didn't affect me. But there 
were, by this time, women tenure track people. And

20:14.623 --> 20:16.907
they greatly attracted to this group. Yes, but 
when the women first started

20:19.300 --> 20:48.177
to really increase the numbers, the inequities 
were very

20:48.629 --> 20:55.420
physical. The fact that

20:55.460 --> 21:08.801
women did not tend to

20:55.460 --> 21:08.801
be welcome in many of the sciences, and I had 
students complain to me about this. They said that

21:08.821 --> 21:13.329
they were in a different part because they just 
didn't really miss that in the end. There were so

21:13.349 --> 21:14.130
few women professors.

21:18.515 --> 21:41.747
And

21:18.515 --> 21:41.747
again,

21:18.515 --> 21:41.747
especially

21:18.515 --> 21:41.747
. And when they did have women professors, they 
treated them better from what I heard. The two

21:43.469 --> 21:44.311
universities are still very young. I don't know 
when.

22:18.708 --> 22:39.829
And

22:18.708 --> 22:39.829
no one really wanted A&M to be tremendously behind 
the times, so I would say there was effort made by

22:18.708 --> 22:39.829
the administration to be more in tune with what was 
happening other places. I don't know, I don't

22:41.350 --> 22:47.196
recall incidents or individuals that marked I do 
know that the core was especially recalcitrant. I

22:51.963 --> 22:53.905
had Melanie Zengraft in class. She was in my 
argumentation class, and she was very good.

22:57.368 --> 22:59.330
Please describe her as well as you know her. Well, 
this was a long time ago, and she was a very incisive

22:59.971 --> 23:05.696
thinker. She wrote excellent papers. She didn't 
ever go overboard in what she did, but she'd always

23:08.539 --> 23:19.090
give kind of bare-bones arguments that were very 
cogent.

23:20.639 --> 23:50.258
her papers were always in on time her attitude in 
class was good she was assertive without being

23:20.639 --> 23:50.258
aggressive in class

23:20.639 --> 23:50.258
and that was a time there was a time and that was part 
of this this was during that time when women tended

23:20.639 --> 23:50.258
to be silent in class did she was not did you ever see 
any evidence of anyone any male student uh picking

23:20.639 --> 23:50.258
on her In class? No. I didn't see that. All right. 
This is a note to the typist. This will go in as an

23:57.724 --> 23:59.467
editorial note. I was dean of faculties at this 
time, and this is the last commencement that I

24:00.248 --> 24:13.444
attended before going in the summer of 1980 to 
become the new president at the University of

24:00.248 --> 24:13.444
Texas at El Paso. This is the last commencement in 
May of 1980. We then had commencements on Friday

24:20.466 --> 24:27.554
afternoon, Friday night, and Saturday morning. 
This is the Saturday morning commencement. NM

24:31.639 --> 24:39.027
students then and now graduate in alphabetical 
order by college, by major, and by last name.

24:40.508 --> 24:51.358
Melanie Zentgraf's undergraduate major was 
biomedical science, which is the only

24:40.508 --> 24:51.358
undergraduate major in the College of Veterinary 
Medicine. So she was the last student, because of

24:52.179 --> 25:03.189
her last name, beginning with the letter Z, from 
the last college, and that was the third

24:52.179 --> 25:03.189
commencement. Her family, I learned later, had 
thought that we had deliberately rigged it so that

25:08.352 --> 25:10.959
she would be the last of the last of the last. That 
part is not true. Our commencement speaker at that

25:13.625 --> 25:22.648
event was William P. Hobby, Jr., the lieutenant 
governor, Bill Hobby from Houston, And while the

25:23.405 --> 25:33.356
diplomas are being passed out, Lieutenant 
Governor Hobby motioned to me to come up from my

25:23.405 --> 25:33.356
seat on about three rows behind him and sit next to 
him. And he told me that when I got out to UTEP to stay

25:33.456 --> 25:42.685
in contact, I should stay in contact with him, that 
he would try to help me since we'd known each other

25:33.456 --> 25:42.685
for about 20 years. And he said such marvelous 
things as maybe I can help UTEP with a special item

25:43.526 --> 25:48.872
or something or other. As I began to note that we 
were about to finish the commencement, I was

25:49.696 --> 25:59.149
starting to get up from my seat and go back to the 
back row when I heard some hissing. I turned to him

26:00.614 --> 26:02.336
and said, oh my goodness. He said, what is it? I 
said, I don't know, but there are some people out

26:03.077 --> 26:10.186
there hissing, which means they're mad about 
something, and particularly the corps members.

26:10.687 --> 26:16.154
And I turned to my right, and I saw that Melanie 
Zentgraf was about to come up on the stage. And I

26:16.174 --> 26:18.657
said, oh my goodness, here comes Melanie 
Zentgraf. He said, gee, Monique, she's really

26:19.058 --> 26:21.801
pestered me. She's been a pain. She's come over. 
She's written letters. She's made... Melanie's

26:27.108 --> 26:44.869
problem was that she had wanted to be on the fish 
drill team, in the A&M band, in the Ross

26:27.108 --> 26:44.869
Volunteers, and for all three of those hopes, she 
had gotten lame excuses and had been not allowed to

26:27.108 --> 26:44.869
compete for one of those positions. The point of 
this editorial note is that within two or three

26:46.351 --> 26:57.064
feet of where I was seated, she came up to receive 
her diploma President Jarvis Miller handed it to

26:57.044 --> 26:59.248
her. She took it in her right hand, shifted it to her 
left hand, then extended her right hand to him, and

26:59.328 --> 27:11.391
he very quietly said, no way, I'm going to shake 
your hand. The lieutenant governor and I and many,

27:13.415 --> 27:20.048
many people in the audience kind of held our breath 
and gasped a bit. She then turned to Bob Lacey, the

27:20.382 --> 27:32.003
registrar who was handing the diplomas to 
President Miller, being sure that he handed the

27:20.382 --> 27:32.003
right diploma to him at the right time. She 
extended her hand to Mr. Lacey, and Mr. Lacey said,

27:32.584 --> 27:37.733
ma'am, I'm not involved in this argument. She then 
turned to Don Carter, who was then on the staff of

27:38.962 --> 27:48.034
the registrar, and he said, ma'am, let's keep the 
line moving. So she went off stage, and being the

27:48.154 --> 27:54.542
last degree recipient, everyone noticed it. 
Paragraph. About six weeks later, when Dr. Miller

27:57.967 --> 28:05.897
was summoned over to a special meeting of the Board 
of Regents, He walked in, and they announced to him

28:06.738 --> 28:17.038
that he had been terminated effective that day at 5 
o'clock, that he had been terminated as

28:06.738 --> 28:17.038
president. They read him a statement, and the 
first thing I understand that they said to him on an

28:17.940 --> 28:28.881
ad lib basis was, you refuse to shake hands with an 
Aggie graduate. Melanie Zentgraf is a person

28:29.485 --> 28:56.328
whose role at A&M is symbolically very

28:29.485 --> 28:56.328
important because she did not receive fair 
treatment particularly on that day and the person

28:29.485 --> 28:56.328
making this statement learned that you shake 
hands with every student and give every student at

28:29.485 --> 28:56.328
least the credit that they deserve. I thought 
that's a good one to add there. That's

28:58.730 --> 28:59.793
interesting. Academically, was she a good 
student? Yeah, she got an A and without a lot of

29:02.821 --> 29:05.728
work. That class, though, was unusual then in that 
there was only one corps member in it. I do remember

29:10.360 --> 29:13.127
that because of this issue. And the other students 
seemed to like Melanie. Also, I believe there was

29:18.352 --> 29:26.262
kind of an anti-core feeling in that class, which 
she may have had something to do with, but I don't

29:18.352 --> 29:26.262
know. But I just remember this one core guy on the 
end seat and Melanie in the front row. We never

29:30.287 --> 29:33.111
discussed issues having to do with the core. It was 
an argumentation class, but we discussed gun

29:33.131 --> 29:40.060
control and capital punishment and abortion and 
all these other old chestnuts. And then we got into

29:40.040 --> 29:50.012
things like polygraphs and like that, other 
topics that I like better because you don't have to

29:40.040 --> 29:50.012
listen to the same old arguments over again. But 
she was a good student and she seemed to have the

29:50.733 --> 29:58.201
class's respect and I liked her. As I understand 
it, her mother, natural mother and stepmother

29:59.703 --> 30:05.490
both were physically handicapped in terms of 
walking and so forth. And their father was a bird

30:11.861 --> 30:26.523
colonel in the Air Force, and therefore she had 
grown up in an atmosphere where you ought to be

30:11.861 --> 30:26.523
allowed to achieve everything that you can 
achieve so that she wouldn't back down from a

30:11.861 --> 30:26.523
competition.

30:29.367 --> 30:32.372
In the 80s and 90s, how did A&M change? How did the 
English department change? How did the campus

30:35.892 --> 30:37.073
change? Okay, I'm trying to kind of link changes to 
dates, and I can't. But

30:43.018 --> 30:56.210
when David Stewart took over the headship, he had 
this kind of notion of the department as promoting

30:43.018 --> 30:56.210
service, as being a service department 
primarily. And he saw, as he put it, cadres of

30:56.410 --> 31:02.275
instructors teaching technical writing. And 
most of us didn't like this. Most of us thought this

31:05.979 --> 31:08.044
was a really bad idea. And yet, despite the fact 
that this was his vision, it was under his

31:09.266 --> 31:15.100
leadership that...
