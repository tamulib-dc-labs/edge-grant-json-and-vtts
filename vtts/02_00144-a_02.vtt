WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:09.730
Maxine was kind of, Maxine Davenport, Emanuel's 
then wife, was kind of den mother to the philosophy

00:01.710 --> 00:09.730
department. And we all had parties. Every weekend 
we had parties. And they were lovely long parties

00:13.710 --> 00:18.730
where there was a lot of drinking going on. And 
people brought their kids and they set them out in

00:18.710 --> 00:24.260
play pens under the trees. And around six o'clock 
somebody would go out for fried chicken. And

00:27.240 --> 00:31.350
sometimes a party would last from noon until two in 
the morning. And we would talk about

00:31.330 --> 00:36.350
philosophical issues and literary issues as well 
as local things. In fact, more than local things.

00:39.330 --> 00:43.940
And so it was really a good time. There were always, 
it was not just the ten of us, because each of these

00:43.920 --> 00:49.940
people had an attachment. It was other people who 
were interested in philosophy. I

00:54.920 --> 01:04.220
would say there would be about sixteen at each of 
these things.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.221
And this went on for quite a while. And many of them 
were interested in philosophy. And Emanuel

01:06.200 --> 01:14.220
Davenport was very enthusiastic about kind of 
philosophy for ordinary people. That was his

01:14.200 --> 01:16.220
shtick. And so we would get in really good 
discussions in which everyone took part. As

01:22.960 --> 01:28.980
opposed to now you get to a philosophy group and 
it's always very specialized, the discussion. So

01:28.960 --> 01:34.980
people cannot participate unless they are, 
unless they know the language, walk the walk, talk

01:28.960 --> 01:34.980
the talk, and so forth. It wasn't that way then. It 
was open discussion. Anybody who had an interest

01:38.960 --> 01:43.320
could easily get into the discussion. Emanuel did 
interesting things. For instance, he joined

01:45.300 --> 01:48.890
Mensa. And then he suggested to Hugh that Hugh 
would be an appropriate member for Mensa, too. And

01:53.870 --> 01:56.890
so I got irritated and I said, well, what about me? 
I'm going to join this group, too. So we went down to

01:57.870 --> 02:03.980
Austin to take the intelligence test, which was 
really goofy. And we joined Mensa. And then

02:05.960 --> 02:07.980
Emanuel had Mensa parties. And these were really 
fun. There would be a couple of Aggies, sometimes

02:09.960 --> 02:12.980
in uniform. There would be some brilliant person 
who never had a chance to get out of a restrictive

02:12.960 --> 02:21.320
life. There would be a handful of people from the 
university. And these people would go over to his

02:24.300 --> 02:29.320
house and he'd provide refreshments and we'd talk 
about stuff. So this was kind of when the

02:29.300 --> 02:34.320
philosophy department got a little bit tired of 
one another. And this was a way of refreshing it.

02:36.300 --> 02:44.320
But one thing I noticed is that he always had these 
chess sets and so forth set out so that anybody who

02:36.300 --> 02:44.320
wanted to can indulge in this kind of thing. But 
nobody ever touched any of this stuff. There were

02:46.300 --> 02:48.320
puzzles, chess sets. People just talked. And 
there was gossip, too, at these things. I didn't

02:52.300 --> 02:55.320
think they were that much different from the 
regular philosophy parties. But there was less

02:55.300 --> 02:58.320
alcohol because there were students. I think we 
had beer. And that was it. But Emanuel always had

03:03.300 --> 03:05.500
some problems. He always had some project. He did a 
lot of work for the BCLU. He was active in the

03:12.480 --> 03:15.500
Unitarian Church. He was a wonderful auctioneer. 
They were always auctioning stuff off for

03:17.480 --> 03:20.500
benefits. And Emanuel was just great at that. And 
so I remember those first few years actually in a

03:24.700 --> 03:33.720
kind of beery haze but very pleasant with Emanuel 
at the helm of the philosophy department. And I

03:33.700 --> 03:35.720
remember that. I think he was in the department 
head. And I remember he was, officially, he was the

03:37.700 --> 03:40.720
department head. Did he operate as a department 
head or department chair? He operated as a

03:43.700 --> 03:47.630
department chair. He did everything 
democratically. And I believe that was an all

03:49.610 --> 03:52.630
Anglo-Mal department? Yes, it was. It was indeed. 
Okay. All right. Now, back over then to you in the

03:56.760 --> 03:58.780
English department. When did you and your husband 
begin to be invited to English department events?

04:02.760 --> 04:03.781
Well, that's hard to say. We had to go to the English 
department. hard to say because they didn't have,

04:06.520 --> 04:12.965
they didn't party. For one thing, there was a much 
greater age spread. I guess there was an age spread

04:21.096 --> 04:27.200
in philosophy too, actually, from Becca to Hugh, 
but there wasn't such an age spread as there was in

04:27.180 --> 04:32.592
English. Some people always invited me to their 
parties. Harry Kreuter, for instance. I would, I

04:41.713 --> 04:43.280
guess I would generalize and say that people who 
were having wild parties included me in.

04:48.453 --> 04:49.640
Philosophy department parties had a reputation, 
so they figured that I'd be up for, game for their

04:49.620 --> 04:53.751
parties too. But the older faculty members did not 
have these parties. They had dinners with their

04:57.920 --> 05:00.940
friends and they didn't socialize throughout the 
department. Did you have any impression of

05:04.970 --> 05:07.903
President Earl Rutter? If so, please describe. I 
never, in fact, there was one, one of the things

05:11.840 --> 05:17.220
that philosophy people used to do was to get 
together on Friday afternoons at a restaurant.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.280
And there was one that Earl Rutter was going to join 
us, but he didn't. Something came up at the last

05:23.000 --> 05:24.274
minute. So I never met the man. Other than that. But 
you must have seen him at, at the, some campus

05:28.520 --> 05:35.540
events where he presided. That's right. I didn't 
usually attend these events then, anything whole

05:37.566 --> 05:43.110
campus, I usually steered clear up and still do if I 
possibly can. But

05:46.901 --> 05:53.820
I remember thinking it was interesting that a 
military man should be in that post. And that this

05:56.583 --> 05:58.499
place was really very military. There was a lot of 
junk going on then. For instance, the Memorial

06:00.711 --> 06:06.300
Student Center grass, there were actually fights 
having to do with walking on the grass. And then,

06:09.033 --> 06:09.600
there was a lot of bass. I was kind of 
anti-military. I participated in the

06:13.637 --> 06:19.320
moratorium, but I didn't really connect this 
anti-military feeling about the war to Rutter,

06:19.300 --> 06:24.640
because of course that wasn't his war. So I would 
say I did not really have much of an impression of

06:25.023 --> 06:30.880
him. Did you notice early on Aggie traditions? Oh, 
yes. First of all, there was a business about the

06:40.596 --> 06:42.424
lawn. Then there was Bonfire. I attended Bonfire 
at that time. When we

06:49.310 --> 06:58.800
passed on heads to David Stewart, David Stewart 
had the, for some reason, the urge to kind of force

06:58.780 --> 07:03.867
traditions on everybody. He made people go to Yale 
practice, for instance. I thought Yale practice

07:06.025 --> 07:08.650
was a totally disgusting tradition. It's kind of 
funny that I should have participated in so many

07:08.630 --> 07:17.090
parties and not like Yale practice, but Yale 
practice seemed to me just out of control. There

07:20.001 --> 07:25.400
was an article in the Texas Observer about the 
Corps some years ago, and I remember reading that.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.540
This was very anti-Corps, really,

07:32.520 --> 07:39.140
but it had all the pictures of all the traditions, 
and I remember thinking, gee, this is really a

07:39.120 --> 07:40.641
crazy place to be. But

07:40.840 --> 07:49.677
I was never either strongly for, or I was not an 
anti-tradition person. On the other hand, there

07:50.500 --> 07:55.970
are quite a few traditions that I didn't really buy 
into. All right. Jack Williams came as president

07:58.016 --> 08:01.586
in late 1970. Did you see him, form an impression of 
him in his early years?

08:12.520 --> 08:13.644
I do remember him.

08:18.482 --> 08:20.710
But the fact of the matter is that the presidency of 
the university and the chancellor seemed so

08:20.710 --> 08:29.170
remote for me that I didn't, my, I was interested in 
the administration up so far as the dean. After

08:33.680 --> 08:35.150
that, it didn't matter to me. Your impression of 
the dean at that time? Yeah. Okay. Well, let's see,

08:41.105 --> 08:43.150
which dean are we talking about? Maxwell. 
Maxwell. I liked Maxwell very much. Why? Maxwell

08:46.985 --> 08:49.330
was a very humane person. Right. Right. And one of 
the things he did, I don't know if you're going to

08:51.270 --> 08:56.700
want to leave this on or not, but I'm going to say it. 
One of the things he did was to collect up drunken

08:58.070 --> 09:02.220
professors in his truck and return them to their 
homes before they could do too much damage to

09:02.200 --> 09:08.000
themselves or for that matter. If they were at, if 
they were at bars and he would get a call and he'd go

09:09.980 --> 09:13.780
out with his red truck and pick this guy up and haul 
him home. He was, he was the person who was

09:17.999 --> 09:22.920
responsible for my staying and not getting the 
boot when, when all of a sudden this place got into

09:32.390 --> 09:37.750
the notion of competitive competition and making 
sure that only scholars were in the English

09:37.730 --> 09:39.237
department and this sort of thing. And Maxwell 
made it clear to Stuart that I was in. Yeah. When did

09:46.394 --> 09:49.860
you become a full-time faculty member? Well, see, 
that's. Continuing. That's what's strange. I was

09:53.840 --> 09:59.652
hired as an instructor and then I was hired 
annually as an instructor. And then I was demoted

10:01.100 --> 10:08.450
to lecture about three years after I was, and this, 
Maxwell did this. He demoted all of us. Everybody

10:09.794 --> 10:14.288
except me, however, who was demoted was a student.

10:16.996 --> 10:21.550
And then Harrison

10:21.530 --> 10:27.757
Hurth was head and Harrison said, well, why don't 
you finish your PhD? And then we could go. Yeah. We

10:29.640 --> 10:31.337
could get you, we could keep you. So I did. I went 
back to Pitt and it only took me about six months. I

10:35.793 --> 10:39.074
got the PA, the thing out of the way and got the 
degree. And so I was put back on the tenure track.

10:43.080 --> 10:48.110
Now,

10:43.080 --> 10:48.110
this is in the seventies. Yes. I was put back on the 
tenure track, I believe in 75. I got the degree in

10:52.625 --> 10:53.929
74.

10:57.120 --> 10:57.260
But I don't remember the sequence. What I don't 
have is a sequence of who was present, who was

11:00.720 --> 11:04.740
department head, when I know that Hurth was very 
supportive to me and that Dave Stewart was not. In

11:06.486 --> 11:11.865
fact, the first thing he did was to rail at me. He 
called me in when he took over and he railed at me

11:13.190 --> 11:20.779
that my file, my file in his office had nothing in 
it.

11:23.730 --> 11:23.830
That is there were no, there was no dossier. There 
was no recommendation. There was nothing. He

11:29.490 --> 11:31.849
said, where are you from? This is an empty folder. 
And I said, you know, I didn't put together the

11:33.280 --> 11:37.571
folder. So then I collected up all the stuff that he 
wanted in it. But he seemed to think that I had done

11:40.728 --> 11:45.570
some, some terrible thing, put something over on 
him that I probably really didn't have a master's

11:45.550 --> 11:49.730
from the University of Pittsburgh at all. But we 
collected the stuff and we got it together. And

11:53.381 --> 11:54.470
Stewart's and my relationship was not ever 
wonderful. All right. And by then you're teaching

11:59.529 --> 12:01.460
what courses? I'm still teaching the same 
courses. Oh. I taught those same courses.

12:09.239 --> 12:10.362
There weren't any other courses. On the 
undergraduate level, there were just a handful of

12:12.750 --> 12:15.339
specialized courses. And I didn't start 
teaching. I'm trying to remember there was all of a

12:20.980 --> 12:28.280
sudden

12:20.980 --> 12:28.280
a tremendous surge in courses.

12:31.349 --> 12:31.690
And then of course I taught all kinds of courses. 
But I was on the undergraduate committee for a

12:36.710 --> 12:39.703
while, for instance, and it was murder to get a 
course through there. You couldn't, you know,

12:40.350 --> 12:46.370
people would put courses through two or three 
years in a row, and they would be stopped. In, in the

12:47.554 --> 12:48.370
department? In the department, yeah. What was the 
reason for their being ? I don't remember. But it

12:55.520 --> 12:58.508
wasn't just yours? That's... I didn't, I didn't 
offer courses. I was on the undergraduate

13:03.036 --> 13:05.410
committee that looked for proposals. And at

13:06.190 --> 14:02.979
one point they

13:06.190 --> 14:02.979
had a

13:06.190 --> 14:02.979
dean. She used to have what certainly looked like 
tea parties. And she would come in and she would

14:05.809 --> 14:07.076
have a bunch of people. And she, in the in the bottom 
of now what is the name of that building uh where

14:19.720 --> 14:24.940
no uh the building with the glass bottom it's new 
relatively new it's got two parts one is sixth

14:27.400 --> 14:32.940
floor and has the dean on top and then it's just oh 
harrington yeah right okay she used to have these

14:32.920 --> 14:37.790
these tea parties in harrington you see her in 
there with all these women drinking tea so they had

14:37.770 --> 14:46.780
a dean of women then after there were many women i 
started to get women coming to me with problems

14:53.470 --> 14:57.250
the explosion of students resulted in the hiring 
of a lot of lectures and we had just what was

14:58.900 --> 15:05.100
interesting too is that i was then demoted but the 
lecturers the male lecturers made more money than

15:05.960 --> 15:08.140
the women

15:13.950 --> 15:18.130
even if there many of them were there for only one 
year and some of them were really strange people

15:18.750 --> 15:22.370
you had the feeling that somebody went out with a 
van and hauled in lecturers but these people would

15:24.270 --> 15:35.780
come and go and i was there and then i don't

15:24.270 --> 15:35.780
know how it affected me personally except that i 
had more people in my classes and there were more

15:42.760 --> 15:48.300
women and i did have women asking me questions 
other than that what what you said women ask your

15:48.280 --> 15:49.421
question came for advice about what what were the 
matters that women came to me about being harassed

15:49.640 --> 15:57.210
by male students that was the biggest one and then 
sexism in classrooms and there were some people

15:57.190 --> 16:04.140
who were taught in such a way as to be really 
insulting to women and i some of them i think didn't

16:04.120 --> 16:08.780
even think about it they've just been doing this 
they made the same jokes they would for instance

16:08.760 --> 16:14.060
they would joke about rape all the time the women 
didn't like that um and women came to ask me what

16:21.280 --> 16:32.280
what should they do uh

16:21.280 --> 16:32.280
how should they deal with either sexist 
instructors or student harassment what advice

16:32.260 --> 16:41.530
did you use it depended on the case in in one or two 
cases i recommended that the student drop the

16:41.510 --> 16:48.620
course uh i recommended that complaints be 
written to deans and this course be dropped i don't

16:48.600 --> 16:53.260
know she did drop their class i don't know whether 
she complained or not students that were being

16:54.760 --> 17:05.640
harassed i recommended that

16:54.760 --> 17:05.640
in one case that uh legal action be taken in other 
cases when it wasn't severe i just told her to be a

17:06.340 --> 17:13.680
little bit more assertive about telling the guy to 
get lost were there some people in that era that you

17:13.660 --> 17:20.480
consider very positive in their sensitivity to 
women's matters in the department let's see

17:27.580 --> 17:46.310
well there was stanley archer who was always able 
to figure out the right thing to do and do it now is he

17:46.290 --> 17:54.020
deceased yes he died yeah and he would have been a 
wonderful repository yeah uh have you talked to

17:54.000 --> 18:01.970
clint mahan clint mahan m-a-c-h-a-n-n because 
clint was a student here i believe when i came as an

18:01.950 --> 18:07.970
instructor and now he's a professor in english yes 
oh no i don't know him but yes stanley was stanley

18:11.280 --> 18:15.620
was wonderfully sensitive to just about any 
matter of decorum and he always did the right thing

18:15.600 --> 18:22.620
uh he was universally liked too what about 
campus-wide were there any people to whom a young

18:23.730 --> 18:31.340
woman could go for help advice i'm

18:32.680 --> 19:09.960
trying to think of what women there were there then 
and the only name that comes to mind is betty

19:09.940 --> 19:11.561
enderberger and i didn't know it in in the 70s did 
you your women faculty members didn't get

19:15.160 --> 19:18.220
together i guess well i liked there was a woman here 
when i came here at deville and linda and i liked her

19:20.360 --> 19:28.310
very much uh we did not just get it there was and then 
the women did start to get together and

19:33.920 --> 19:40.900
it worked when the women's faculty network 
started up i didn't like it it didn't seem it didn't

19:40.880 --> 19:45.140
seem very relevant to me so i never really 
participated in that that was years and years

19:45.120 --> 19:57.610
later there may have been uh but i don't remember 
there was a group

19:57.590 --> 20:01.520
with department tracking decision

20:01.500 --> 20:09.100
this is not good i was not at the time so it didn't 
affect me but there were and they

20:10.200 --> 20:18.960
greatly objected

20:10.200 --> 20:18.960
to ruby behind all right now by the late seventies 
didn't it the

20:24.240 --> 20:48.610
inequities were very significant behind

20:48.590 --> 20:55.290
all right now by the late seventies the inequities 
were very significant And

20:57.090 --> 21:03.590
I had kids explaining it to me. They said that they 
were in English at heart because they could see the

21:03.570 --> 21:07.590
beauty of English without

21:07.570 --> 21:12.036
any of it. There were so few

21:12.680 --> 21:20.058
women professors. And again, especially when 
they did have women professors, they were treated

21:20.480 --> 21:24.520
bad at

21:24.500 --> 21:31.929
the moment. The time of the university

21:32.230 --> 21:40.255
was still very young. I don't

21:40.275 --> 21:44.910
know when, but

21:44.890 --> 22:26.350
it wasn't very old. And no one really wanted A&M to 
be tremendously behind the times. So I would say

22:30.410 --> 22:34.840
there was effort made by the administration to be 
more in tune with what was happening other places.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.460
I don't know, I don't recall incidents or 
individuals that marked I do know that the Corps

22:49.060 --> 22:51.969
was especially recalcitrant. I had Melanie 
Zengraft in class. She was in my argumentation.

22:55.060 --> 22:56.494
She was very good. Please describe her as well as 
you know her. Well, this was a long time ago. And she

23:02.009 --> 23:03.080
was a very incisive thinker. She wrote excellent 
papers. She didn't ever go overboard in what she

23:11.060 --> 23:11.585
did. But she'd always give kind of bare bones 
arguments that were very cogent. Her papers were

23:19.060 --> 23:23.740
always in on time. Her attitude in class was good. 
She was assertive without being aggressive in

23:28.320 --> 23:32.340
class. And

23:32.320 --> 23:38.930
that was a time, there was a time, this was during 
that time, when women tended to be silent in class.

23:42.910 --> 23:44.769
She was not. Did you ever see any evidence of 
anyone, any male student picking on her in class?

23:52.243 --> 23:52.445
No. I didn't see that. Alright, this is a note to the 
typist. This will go in as an editorial note. I was

24:00.260 --> 24:03.180
dean of faculties at this time and this is the last 
commencement that I attended before going in the

24:07.160 --> 24:11.180
summer of 1980 to become the new president of the 
University of Texas at El Paso. This is the last

24:15.560 --> 24:19.580
commencement in May of 1980. We then had 
commencements on Friday afternoon, Friday

24:23.560 --> 24:27.580
night, and Saturday morning. This is the Saturday 
morning commencement. NM students then and now

24:32.610 --> 24:36.630
graduate in alphabetical order by college, by 
major, and by last name. Melanie Zentgraf's

24:41.240 --> 24:45.260
undergraduate major was biomedical science, 
which is the only undergraduate major in the

24:49.240 --> 24:51.381
College of Veterinary Medicine. So she was the 
last student, because of her last name, beginning

24:57.240 --> 25:01.350
with the letter Z, from the last college and that 
was the third commencement. Her family, I learned

25:03.370 --> 25:05.350
later, had thought that we had deliberately 
rigged it so that she would be the last of the last of

25:09.330 --> 25:10.961
the last. That part is not true. Our commencement 
speaker at that event was William P. Hobby, Jr.,

25:17.740 --> 25:21.760
the lieutenant governor, Bill Hobby from 
Houston. And while the diplomas were being passed

25:23.693 --> 25:27.760
out, Lieutenant Governor Hobby motioned to me to 
come up from my seat on about three rows behind him

25:31.740 --> 25:33.356
and sit next to him. And he told me that when I got out 
to UTEP to stay in contact, I should stay in contact

25:35.740 --> 25:39.760
with him, that he would try to help me since we'd 
known each other for about 20 years. And he said

25:43.740 --> 25:47.760
such marvelous things as maybe I can help UTEP with 
a special item or something or other. As I began to

25:49.821 --> 25:51.760
note that we were about to finish the 
commencement, I was starting to get up from my seat

25:51.740 --> 25:55.760
and go back to the back row when I heard some 
hissing. I turned to him and said, oh my goodness.

26:02.379 --> 26:03.066
He said, what is it? I said, I don't know, but there 
are some people out there hissing, which means

26:04.440 --> 26:08.460
they're mad about something, particularly the 
corps members. And I turned to my right and I saw

26:12.440 --> 26:16.177
that Melanie Zentgraf was about to come up on the 
stage. And I said, oh my goodness, here comes

26:16.440 --> 26:18.662
Melanie Zentgraf. He said, gee, Monique, she's 
really pestered me. She's been a pain. She's come

26:23.410 --> 26:24.157
over. She's written letters. Melanie's problem 
was that she had wanted to be on the fish drill team,

26:28.440 --> 26:32.460
in the A&M band, in the Ross Volunteers. And for all 
three of those hopes, she had gotten lame excuses

26:36.440 --> 26:40.460
and had been not allowed to compete for one of those 
positions. The point of this editorial note is

26:48.840 --> 26:52.860
that within two or three feet of where I was seated, 
she came up to receive her diploma. President

26:56.840 --> 26:59.284
Jarvis Miller handed it to her. She took it in her 
right hand, shifted it to her left hand, then

27:00.840 --> 27:04.860
extended her right hand to him. And he very quietly 
said, no way, I'm going to shake your hand. The

27:13.760 --> 27:17.780
Lieutenant Governor and I and many, many people in 
the audience kind of held our breath and gasped a

27:17.760 --> 27:19.417
bit. She then turned to Bob Lacy, the Registrar who 
was handing the diplomas to President Miller,

27:25.760 --> 27:29.970
being sure that he handed the right diploma to him 
at the right time. She extended her hand to Mr. Lacy

27:33.950 --> 27:37.970
and Mr. Lacy said, ma'am, I'm not involved in this 
argument. She then turned to Don Carter, who was

27:37.950 --> 27:42.540
the then on the staff of the Registrar, and he said, 
ma'am, let's keep the line moving. So she went off

27:48.156 --> 27:50.540
stage and being the last degree recipient, 
everyone noticed it. Paragraph.

27:57.961 --> 27:59.350
About six weeks later, when Dr. Miller was 
summoned over to a special meeting of the Board of

28:03.330 --> 28:07.500
Regents, he walked in and they announced to him 
that he had been terminated effective that day at 5

28:11.480 --> 28:15.530
o'clock, that he had been terminated as 
President. They read him a statement and the first

28:19.510 --> 28:23.530
thing I understand that they said to him on an ad lib 
basis was, you refuse to shake hands with an Aggie

28:27.510 --> 28:28.662
graduate. Melanie is a person whose role at A&M is 
symbolically very important because she did not

28:39.510 --> 28:43.530
receive fair treatment, particularly on that 
day, and the person making this statement learned

28:47.510 --> 28:51.530
that you shake hands with every student and give 
every student at least the credit that they

28:55.510 --> 28:56.318
deserve. I thought that's a good one to add there. 
That's interesting. Academically, was she a good

28:59.510 --> 29:02.823
student? Yeah, she got an A and without a lot of 
work. That class, though, was unusual then in that

29:07.510 --> 29:10.278
there was only one corps member in it. I do remember 
that because of this issue. The other students

29:13.510 --> 29:18.260
seemed to like Melanie. Also, I believe there was 
kind of an anti-corps feeling in that class which

29:22.240 --> 29:26.260
she may have had something to do with, but I don't 
know. I just remember this one corps guy on the end

29:26.240 --> 29:30.260
seat and Melanie in the front row. We never 
discussed issues having to do with the corps. It

29:33.149 --> 29:34.260
was an argumentation class but we discussed gun 
control and capital punishment and abortion and

29:34.240 --> 29:38.260
all these other old chestnuts. Then we got into 
things like polygraphs and like that. Topics that

29:46.240 --> 29:50.260
I liked better because you don't have to listen to 
the same old arguments over again. But she was a

29:50.240 --> 29:54.260
good student and she seemed to have the class's 
respect and I liked her. As I understand it, her

29:58.240 --> 30:02.750
mother, natural mother and stepmother both were 
physically handicapped in terms of walking and so

30:06.850 --> 30:10.870
forth. And their father was a bird colonel in the 
Air Force and therefore she had grown up in an

30:14.850 --> 30:18.870
atmosphere and you ought to be allowed to achieve 
everything that you can achieve. So that she

30:22.850 --> 30:26.870
wouldn't back down from a competition. In the 80s 
and 90s, how did A&M change? How did the English

30:34.167 --> 30:36.200
department change? How did the campus change? 
Okay, I'm trying to kind of link changes to dates

30:40.180 --> 30:42.321
and I can't. But when David Stewart took over the 
headship, he had this kind of notion of the

30:49.740 --> 30:53.760
department as promoting service as being a 
service department primarily. And he saw as he put

30:57.760 --> 31:01.780
it, cadres of instructors teaching technical 
writing. And most of us didn't like this. Most of us

31:06.010 --> 31:10.030
thought this was a really bad idea. Yet, despite 
the fact that this was his vision, it was under his

31:14.010 --> 31:16.030
leadership that
