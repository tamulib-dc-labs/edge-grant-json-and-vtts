WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:09.730
Maxine was kind of, Maxine Davenport, Emanuel's 
then wife, was kind of den mother to the philosophy

00:01.710 --> 00:09.730
department. And we all had parties. Every weekend 
we had parties. And they were lovely long parties

00:13.710 --> 00:18.730
where there was a lot of drinking going on. And 
people brought their kids and they set them out in

00:18.710 --> 00:24.260
play pens under the trees. And around six o'clock 
somebody would go out for fried chicken. And

00:27.240 --> 00:31.350
sometimes a party would last from noon until two in 
the morning. And we would talk about

00:31.330 --> 00:36.350
philosophical issues and literary issues as well 
as local things. In fact, more than local things.

00:39.330 --> 00:43.940
And so it was really a good time. There were always, 
it was not just the ten of us, because each of these

00:43.920 --> 00:49.940
people had an attachment. It was other people who 
were interested in philosophy. I

00:54.920 --> 01:04.220
would say there would be about sixteen at each of 
these things.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.221
And this went on for quite a while. And many of them 
were interested in philosophy. And Emanuel

01:06.200 --> 01:14.220
Davenport was very enthusiastic about kind of 
philosophy for ordinary people. That was his

01:14.200 --> 01:16.220
shtick. And so we would get in really good 
discussions in which everyone took part. As

01:22.960 --> 01:28.980
opposed to now you get to a philosophy group and 
it's always very specialized, the discussion. So

01:28.960 --> 01:34.980
people cannot participate unless they are, 
unless they know the language, walk the walk, talk

01:28.960 --> 01:34.980
the talk, and so forth. It wasn't that way then. It 
was open discussion. Anybody who had an interest

01:38.960 --> 01:43.320
could easily get into the discussion. Emanuel did 
interesting things. For instance, he joined

01:45.300 --> 01:48.890
Mensa. And then he suggested to Hugh that Hugh 
would be an appropriate member for Mensa, too. And

01:53.870 --> 01:56.890
so I got irritated and I said, well, what about me? 
I'm going to join this group, too. So we went down to

01:57.870 --> 02:03.980
Austin to take the intelligence test, which was 
really goofy. And we joined Mensa. And then

02:05.960 --> 02:07.980
Emanuel had Mensa parties. And these were really 
fun. There would be a couple of Aggies, sometimes

02:09.960 --> 02:12.980
in uniform. There would be some brilliant person 
who never had a chance to get out of a restrictive

02:12.960 --> 02:21.320
life. There would be a handful of people from the 
university. And these people would go over to his

02:24.300 --> 02:29.320
house and he'd provide refreshments and we'd talk 
about stuff. So this was kind of when the

02:29.300 --> 02:34.320
philosophy department got a little bit tired of 
one another. And this was a way of refreshing it.

02:36.300 --> 02:44.320
But one thing I noticed is that he always had these 
chess sets and so forth set out so that anybody who

02:36.300 --> 02:44.320
wanted to can indulge in this kind of thing. But 
nobody ever touched any of this stuff. There were

02:46.300 --> 02:48.320
puzzles, chess sets. People just talked. And 
there was gossip, too, at these things. I didn't

02:52.300 --> 02:55.320
think they were that much different from the 
regular philosophy parties. But there was less

02:55.300 --> 02:58.320
alcohol because there were students. I think we 
had beer. And that was it. But Emanuel always had

03:03.300 --> 03:05.500
some problems. He always had some project. He did a 
lot of work for the BCLU. He was active in the

03:12.480 --> 03:15.500
Unitarian Church. He was a wonderful auctioneer. 
They were always auctioning stuff off for

03:17.480 --> 03:20.500
benefits. And Emanuel was just great at that. And 
so I remember those first few years actually in a

03:24.700 --> 03:33.720
kind of beery haze but very pleasant with Emanuel 
at the helm of the philosophy department. Well,

03:33.700 --> 03:35.720
have you ever heard of him? I've never heard of him. 
I've never heard of him. But he was a very good man.

03:38.700 --> 03:39.721
He had a very good sense of humor. And he was a very 
good man. And he was very good at that. He was a very

03:41.700 --> 03:42.721
good man. And that's what I remember. The reason I 
think that he was so good at that is because he was a

03:43.700 --> 03:46.630
very good captain. He was a very good captain. He 
was always a very good captain. He operated as a

03:50.610 --> 03:51.631
department chair. He did everything 
democratically. And I believe that was an all

03:52.610 --> 03:53.781
Anglo male department, huh? Yes, it was. It was 
indeed. English department. When did you and your

03:57.928 --> 04:02.880
husband begin to be invited to English department 
events? Well, that's hard to say because they

04:05.427 --> 04:12.969
didn't have, they didn't party. For one thing, 
there was a much greater age spread. I guess there

04:21.098 --> 04:24.170
was an age spread in philosophy, too, actually, 
from Becca to Hugh, but there wasn't such an age

04:24.150 --> 04:32.558
spread as there was in English. Some people always 
invited me to their parties. Harry Kreuter, for

04:38.723 --> 04:41.756
instance. I guess I would generalize and say that 
people who were having wild parties included me

04:42.620 --> 04:46.664
in. Philosophy department parties had a 
reputation, so they figured that I'd be up for,

04:49.280 --> 04:53.940
game for their parties, too. But the older faculty 
members. Oh, yeah. Did not have these parties.

04:57.913 --> 05:02.220
They had dinners with their friends, and they 
didn't socialize throughout the department. Did

05:04.830 --> 05:07.903
you have any impression of President Earl Rudder? 
If so, please describe. I never, in fact, there was

05:11.820 --> 05:17.200
one, one of the things that philosophy people used 
to do was to get together on Friday afternoons at a

05:17.180 --> 05:21.260
restaurant, and there was one that Earl Rudder was 
going to join us, but he didn't. Something came up

05:23.000 --> 05:24.760
at the last minute, so I never met the man. Other 
than that. But you must have seen him at the, some

05:28.300 --> 05:37.270
campus events where he presided. I didn't usually 
attend these events then. Anything, whole

05:40.554 --> 05:42.890
campus, I usually steered clear of, and still do if 
I possibly can. But

05:46.902 --> 05:52.840
I remember thinking it was interesting that a 
military man should be in that post, and that this

05:52.820 --> 05:58.640
place was really very military. There was a lot of 
junk going on then. I remember when I was a student,

06:00.620 --> 06:06.280
for instance, the Memorial Student Center grass, 
there were actually fights having to do with

06:06.260 --> 06:09.940
walking on the grass. I was kind of anti-military. 
I participated in the moratorium. But I didn't

06:18.343 --> 06:21.840
really connect this anti-military feeling about 
the war to Rudder, because of course that wasn't

06:21.820 --> 06:25.000
his war. So I would say I did not really have much of 
an impression of him. Did you notice early on Aggie

06:30.860 --> 06:36.880
traditions? Oh, yes. Which ones? Well, first of 
all, there was a business about the lawn. Then

06:42.542 --> 06:45.640
there was Bonfire. I attended Bonfire at that 
time. There was, when we passed on heads to David

06:49.292 --> 06:57.580
Stewart, David Stewart had the, for some reason, 
the urge to kind of force him to do things. He forced

07:02.650 --> 07:03.884
traditions on everybody. He made people go to Yale 
practice, for instance. I thought Yale practice

07:06.250 --> 07:08.427
was a totally disgusting tradition. It's kind of 
funny that I should have participated in so many

07:11.250 --> 07:16.737
parties

07:11.250 --> 07:16.737
and not like Yale practice. But Yale practice 
seemed to me just out of control. There

07:19.992 --> 07:27.913
was an article in the Texas Observer about the 
Corps some years ago. And I remember reading that.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.320
This was very interesting. Oh, yes. Yes. It was 
very anti-Corps, really. But it had all the

07:36.074 --> 07:38.099
pictures of all the traditions. And I remember 
thinking, gee, this is really a crazy place to be.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.820
But I was never either strongly for, or I was not an 
anti-tradition person. On the other hand, there

07:49.729 --> 07:51.260
are quite a few traditions that I didn't really buy 
into. All right. All right. Jack Williams came as

07:58.014 --> 08:01.586
president in late 1970. Did you see him, H.W. Too 
late. H.W. Where did you see your impression

08:07.082 --> 08:12.780
of him in his early years? H.W. I do remember him.

08:18.488 --> 08:19.010
But the fact of the matter is that the presidency of 
the university, and the chancellor, seemed so

08:21.730 --> 08:30.990
remote for me that I didn't—my—I

08:21.730 --> 08:30.990
was interested in the administration up so far as 
the dean. After that, it didn't matter to me. H.W.

08:36.991 --> 08:38.250
Your impression of the dean? H.W. Yeah. Okay, 
well, let's see, which dean are we talking about?

08:42.470 --> 08:42.673
H.W. Maxwell. Maxwell. I like Maxwell very much. 
Why? Maxwell was a very humane person. And one of

08:51.050 --> 08:52.930
the things he did, I don't know if you're going to 
want to leave this on or not, but I'm going to say it.

08:57.980 --> 09:01.860
One of the things he did was to collect up drunken 
professors in his truck and return them to their

09:01.840 --> 09:04.280
homes before they could do too much damage to 
themselves or for that matter. What do you mean if

09:08.820 --> 09:10.021
they were at a party or something? If they were at 
bars and he would get a call and he'd go out with his

09:13.100 --> 09:14.581
red truck and pick this guy up and haul him home. He 
was the person who was responsible for my staying

09:23.820 --> 09:25.261
and not getting the boot when all of a sudden this 
place got into the notion of competitive

09:32.890 --> 09:34.730
competition and making sure that only scholars 
were in the English department and this sort of

09:38.390 --> 09:39.231
thing. And Maxwell made it clear to Stuart that I 
was in. Yeah. Wendy. Did you become a full-time

09:46.600 --> 09:50.380
faculty member? Well, see, that's what's 
strange. I was hired as an instructor. And then I

09:57.060 --> 09:59.520
was hired annually as an instructor. And then I was 
demoted to lecturer about three years after I

10:03.240 --> 10:07.070
was... And this, Maxwell did this. He demoted all 
of us, everybody, except me, however, who was

10:10.850 --> 10:14.230
demoted, was a student.

10:16.960 --> 10:22.490
And then... Harrison

10:16.960 --> 10:22.490
Hurth was head. And Harrison said, well, why don't 
you finish your Ph.D.? And then we could get you, we

10:27.780 --> 10:30.220
could keep you. So I did. I went back to Pitt. It only 
took me about six months. I got the thing out of the

10:35.720 --> 10:38.980
way and got the degree. And so I was put back on the 
tenure track.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.450
This is in the 70s. Yes. I was put back on the tenure 
track, I believe, in 75. I got the degree in 74.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.460
But I don't remember the sequence. What I don't 
have is the sequence of who was department head.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.080
When I know that Hurth was very supportive to me and 
that Dave Stewart was not.

11:08.430 --> 11:11.850
In fact, the first thing he did was to rail at me. He 
called me in when he took over. And he railed at me

11:14.130 --> 11:19.870
that my file in his office had nothing in it. That 
is, there were no... There was no dossier. There

11:26.530 --> 11:28.870
was no recommendation. There was nothing. He 
said, where are you from? This is an empty folder.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.620
And I said, you know, I didn't put together the 
folder. So then I collected up all the stuff that he

11:37.600 --> 11:40.940
wanted in it. But he seemed to think that I had done 
some terrible thing, put something over on him

11:46.130 --> 11:49.030
that I probably really didn't have a master's from 
the University of Pittsburgh at all. We collected

11:51.070 --> 11:53.890
the stuff and we got it together. And Stewart's in 
my relationship. And his relationship was not

11:54.970 --> 11:58.740
ever wonderful. And by then you're teaching what 
courses? I'm still teaching the same courses. I

12:03.880 --> 12:07.080
taught those same courses. There weren't any 
other courses. On the undergraduate level, there

12:11.010 --> 12:17.060
were just a handful of specialized courses. And I 
didn't start teaching... I'm trying to remember,

12:20.820 --> 12:27.900
there was all of a sudden

12:20.820 --> 12:27.900
a tremendous surge in courses. And then of course, 
I was still teaching. Right. course I taught all

12:31.811 --> 12:36.710
kinds of courses but I was on the undergraduate 
committee for a while for instance and it was

12:36.690 --> 12:39.950
murder to get a course through there you couldn't 
you know you people would put courses through two

12:39.930 --> 12:44.630
or three years in a row and they would be stopped in 
in the department in the department yeah what was

12:50.530 --> 12:59.110
the reason for their beings I don't remember

12:50.530 --> 12:59.110
but it wasn't just yours that's I didn't I didn't 
offer courses I was on the undergraduate and at

12:59.090 --> 13:53.820
one point they

13:53.800 --> 14:07.660
had a deep

13:53.800 --> 14:07.660
see she used to have certainly looked like tea 
parties in the in the bottom of now what is the name

14:07.640 --> 14:21.460
of that building where no

14:07.640 --> 14:21.460
the building with the glass bottom it's new 
relatively new it's got two parts so one is sixth

14:21.440 --> 14:28.740
floor and has the Dean on top and then they yeah it's 
just Oh Harrington yeah right okay she used to have

14:30.280 --> 14:35.650
these these tea parties in Harrington and see her 
in there with all these women drinking tea so they

14:35.630 --> 14:41.980
had a Dean of women then after there were many women 
I started to get women coming to me with problems

14:48.020 --> 14:56.090
the explosion of students resulted in the hiring 
of a lot of lectures and we had just what was

14:56.070 --> 15:02.580
interesting too is that I was then demoted but the 
lecturers the male lecturers made more money than

15:02.560 --> 15:07.380
the women even if

15:07.360 --> 15:16.970
their many of them were there for only one year and 
some of them were really strange people you had the

15:16.950 --> 15:20.490
feeling that somebody went out with a van and 
called in lectures but these people would come and

15:20.470 --> 15:28.030
go and I was there and then I

15:28.010 --> 15:39.780
don't know how it affected me personally except 
that I had more people in my classes There were more

15:42.000 --> 15:45.900
women and I did have women asking me questions 
other than that What what you said women ask you

15:45.880 --> 15:50.380
question came for advice about what? What were the 
matters that women came to me about being harassed

15:51.610 --> 15:56.841
by male students? That was the biggest one And then 
sexism in classrooms And there were some people

16:02.320 --> 16:07.880
who were taught in such a way as to be really 
insulting to women and I some of them I think didn't

16:07.860 --> 16:09.539
even think about it. They just been doing this. 
They made the same jokes They would for instance

16:13.660 --> 16:16.420
They would joke about rape all the time the women 
didn't like that And women came to ask me what what

16:17.560 --> 16:22.680
should they do?

16:27.760 --> 16:32.500
How should they deal with either sexist 
instructors or student harassment

16:35.630 --> 16:37.650
It depended on the case in In one or two cases I 
recommended that the student drop the course I

16:45.820 --> 16:49.585
recommended that complaints be written to Dean's 
and this course be dropped. I don't know. She did

16:50.532 --> 16:51.800
drop their class I don't know whether she 
complained or not the students that were being

16:54.200 --> 16:56.680
harassed I Recommended that

16:58.380 --> 17:07.020
in one case that legal action be taken in other 
cases When it wasn't severe I just told her to be a

17:08.920 --> 17:15.380
little bit more assertive about telling the guy to 
get lost Were there some people in that? Era that

17:18.080 --> 17:23.620
you consider very positive in their sensitivity 
to women's In the department see

17:27.660 --> 17:46.690
Whether it was Stanley Archer who was always able 
to figure out the right thing to do and do it Is he

17:47.760 --> 17:48.944
deceased? Yes He died. Yeah, and he would have been 
a wonderful repository. Yeah Have you talked to

17:55.350 --> 17:57.370
Clint Mahon? Clint Mahon m-a-c-h-a-n-n Because 
Clint was a student here, I believe, when I came as

18:00.230 --> 18:04.390
an instructor, and now he's a professor. In 
English? Yes. Oh, no. I don't know him. But yes,

18:11.220 --> 18:18.040
Stanley was wonderfully sensitive to just about 
any matter of decorum. And he always did the right

18:18.020 --> 18:21.040
thing. He was universally liked, too. What about 
campus-wide? Were there any people to whom a young

18:25.450 --> 18:32.780
woman could go for help, advice, guidance? I'm

18:32.760 --> 19:08.960
trying to think of what women there were there, 
then. And the only name that comes to mind is Betty

19:08.940 --> 19:13.300
Underburger, and I didn't know it. In the 70s, did 
you, your women faculty members didn't get

19:13.280 --> 19:19.300
together, I gather? No. Well, I liked, there was a 
woman here when I came

19:20.023 --> 19:27.030
to Louisville, and I liked her very much, and she 
left immediately. We did not get together. There

19:30.520 --> 19:33.540
was, and then the women did start to get together. 
When

19:33.520 --> 19:39.780
the women faculty network started up, I didn't 
like it much. It didn't seem very relevant to me, so

19:39.760 --> 19:43.780
I never really participated in that. That was 
years and years later. There may have been, but I

19:45.760 --> 19:50.030
don't remember. There was a group, but

19:50.010 --> 19:57.570
women were definitely not invited. The 
department did it, and this was not good. I was not

20:05.850 --> 20:11.460
at the time, so it didn't affect me, but there were, 
by this time, a lot of women in the faculty. And they

20:13.440 --> 20:18.760
greatly attracted

20:13.440 --> 20:18.760
to this group. Behind? Right now, by the late 70s.

20:46.980 --> 20:55.230
The

20:46.980 --> 20:55.230
inequities were very significant. The

20:55.210 --> 21:02.560
whole fact that women did not seem to be welcome in, 
and I had to explain to you that.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.710
They said that they were an invisible part because 
they didn't see the beauty of that in

21:07.690 --> 21:12.031
you. There were so few women in the faculty. And

21:13.800 --> 21:24.640
again, especially when they did have women 
professors, they were treated badly from

21:24.620 --> 21:33.407
there. The time of the university was very, very 
long. I

21:34.350 --> 21:53.200
don't know when, but it wasn't

21:34.350 --> 21:53.200
very long. And

21:53.180 --> 22:30.550
no one really wanted A&M to be tremendously behind 
the times. So I would say there was effort made by

22:30.530 --> 22:38.340
the administration to be more in tune with the 
faculty.

22:41.330 --> 22:50.200
I don't know, I don't recall incidents or 
individuals that marked, I do know that the core

22:50.180 --> 22:51.201
was especially recalcitrant. I had Melanie 
Zengraft in class. She was in my argumentation

22:54.180 --> 22:57.200
class, and she was very good. Please describe her 
as well as you know her. Well, this was a long time

23:00.180 --> 23:06.200
ago, and she was a very, she was a very incisive 
thinker. She wrote excellent papers. She didn't

23:08.180 --> 23:09.201
ever go oral. She didn't ever go overboard in what 
she did. But she'd always give kind of bare bones

23:13.180 --> 23:20.860
arguments that were very cogent.

23:20.840 --> 23:24.860
Her papers were always in on time. Her attitude in 
class was good. She was assertive without being

23:28.440 --> 23:36.050
aggressive in class.

23:36.030 --> 23:41.050
And that was a time, there was a time, and that was 
part of this, this was during that time. She would

23:41.739 --> 23:44.050
be silent in class. She was not. Did you ever see any 
evidence of anyone, any male student picking on

23:45.030 --> 23:52.050
her in class? No. I didn't see that. All right. This 
is a note to the typist. This will go in as an

23:57.030 --> 24:00.050
editorial note. I was dean of faculties at this 
time, and this is the last commencement that I

24:00.030 --> 24:06.300
attended before going in the summer of 1980 to 
become the new president at the University of

24:06.280 --> 24:11.300
Texas. At El Paso. This is the last commencement in 
May of 1980. We then had commencements on Friday

24:19.680 --> 24:27.700
afternoon, Friday night, and Saturday morning. 
This is the Saturday morning commencement. NM

24:29.680 --> 24:38.750
students then and now graduate in alphabetical 
order by college, by major, and by last name.

24:38.730 --> 24:41.380
Melanie Zentgraf's undergraduate name. Melanie 
Zentgraf's undergraduate major was biomedical

24:41.360 --> 24:47.380
science, which is the only undergraduate major in 
the College of Veterinary Medicine. So she was the

24:51.360 --> 24:59.380
last student, because of her last name, beginning 
with the letter Z, from the last college, and that

24:59.360 --> 25:02.470
was the third commencement. Her family, I learned 
later, had thought that we had deliberately

25:02.450 --> 25:08.470
rigged it so that she would be the last of the last of 
the last. That part is not true. Our commencement

25:12.450 --> 25:20.880
speaker at that event was William P. Hobby, Jr., 
the lieutenant governor, Bill Hobby, from

25:20.860 --> 25:22.880
Houston. And while the diplomas are being passed 
out, Lieutenant Governor Hobby motioned to me to

25:27.860 --> 25:33.880
come up from my seat on about three rows behind him 
and sit next to him, and he told me that when I got out

25:33.860 --> 25:38.880
to UTEP to stay in contact, I should stay in contact 
with him, that he would try to help me, since we

25:38.860 --> 25:39.881
didn't. He would try to help me, since we'd known 
each other for about 20 years, and he said such

25:43.860 --> 25:49.880
marvelous things as maybe I can help UTEP with a 
special item or something or other. As I began to

25:49.860 --> 25:54.380
note that we were about to finish the 
commencement, I was starting to get up from my seat

25:54.360 --> 26:00.580
and go back to the back row when I heard some 
hissing. I turned to him and said, oh, my goodness.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.581
He said, what is it? I said, I don't know, but there 
are some people out there hissing, which means

26:03.560 --> 26:07.020
they're mad about something, and particularly 
the corps members. And I turned to my right, and I

26:10.560 --> 26:15.580
saw that Melanie Zentgraf was about to come up on 
the stage, and I said, oh, my goodness, here comes

26:15.560 --> 26:18.580
Melanie Zentgraf. He said, gee, Monique, she's 
really pestered me. She's been a pain. She's come

26:23.560 --> 26:24.581
over. She's written letters. She's 
made—Melanie's problem was that she had wanted to

26:25.560 --> 26:31.580
be on the fish drill team, in the A&M band, in the 
Ross Volunteers, and for all three of those hopes,

26:31.560 --> 26:38.580
she had gotten lame excuses. And had been not 
allowed to compete for one of those positions. The

26:45.960 --> 26:52.980
point of this editorial note is that within two or 
three feet of where I was seated, she came up to

26:52.960 --> 26:56.980
receive her diploma. President Jarvis Miller 
handed it to her. She took it in her right hand,

26:58.960 --> 27:04.980
shifted it to her left hand, then extended her 
right hand to him, and he very quietly said, no way.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.900
I'm going to shake your hand. The lieutenant 
governor and I and many, many people in the

27:12.880 --> 27:17.900
audience kind of held our breath and gasped a bit. 
She then turned to Bob Lacy, the registrar who was

27:19.880 --> 27:26.900
handing the diplomas to President Miller, being 
sure that he handed the right diploma to him at the

27:26.880 --> 27:32.090
right time. She extended her hand to Mr. Lacy, and 
Mr. Lacy said, ma'am, I'm not involved in this

27:37.070 --> 27:37.592
argument. She then turned to Don Carter, who was 
then on the staff of the registrar, and he said,

27:45.640 --> 27:47.660
ma'am, let's keep the line moving. So she went off 
stage, and being the last degree recipient,

27:47.640 --> 27:54.660
everyone noticed it. Paragraph.

27:57.950 --> 28:04.470
About six weeks later, when Dr. Miller was 
summoned over to a special meeting of the Board of

28:04.450 --> 28:09.620
Regents, he walked in, and they announced to him 
that he had received the diploma. He said that he

28:09.600 --> 28:16.650
had been terminated effective that day at 5 
o'clock, that he had been terminated as

28:16.630 --> 28:17.052
president. They read him a statement, and the 
first thing I understand that they said to him on an

28:17.937 --> 28:24.650
ad lib basis was, you refuse to shake hands with an 
Aggie graduate. Melanie Zinkgraf is a person

28:30.630 --> 28:36.650
whose role at A&M is symbolically very important. 
She's a great person. She's a great person. She's a

28:38.630 --> 28:39.651
great person. I thought that was important, 
because she did not receive fair treatment

28:39.630 --> 28:45.650
particularly on that day. And the person making 
this statement learned that you shake hands with

28:47.630 --> 28:52.650
every student and give every student at least the 
credit that they deserve. I thought that's a good

28:56.630 --> 28:58.650
one to add there. Oh, that's interesting. Was she 
academically, was she a good student? Yeah. She

29:03.137 --> 29:05.650
got an A, and without a lot of work. That class, 
though, was unusual then. there was only one corps

29:08.630 --> 29:15.940
member in it i do remember that because of this 
issue and the other students seemed to like

29:15.920 --> 29:21.220
melanie and there was a also i believe there was 
kind of an anti-core feeling in that class which

29:21.200 --> 29:26.420
she may have had something to do with but i don't 
know but i just remember this one core guy on the end

29:26.400 --> 29:31.300
seat and melanie in the front row and she was we 
never discussed issues having to do with the core

29:31.280 --> 29:35.540
it was an argumentation class but we did we 
discussed gun control and capital punishment and

29:35.520 --> 29:41.620
abortion and all these other old chestnuts and 
then we got into things like polygraphs and like

29:41.600 --> 29:48.500
that other topics that i like better because you 
don't have to listen to the same old arguments over

29:48.480 --> 29:55.780
again but she was a good student and she seemed to 
have the class's respect that i liked her as i

29:55.760 --> 30:05.150
understand it her mother natural mother and 
stepmother both were physically handicapped in

30:06.370 --> 30:13.190
terms of walking and so forth and their father was a 
bird colonel in the air force and therefore she had

30:13.170 --> 30:19.350
grown up in an atmosphere and you ought to be 
allowed to achieve everything that you can and so

30:19.330 --> 30:26.390
that she wouldn't back down from a competition the 
in the in the 80s and 90s how did ann change how did

30:28.830 --> 30:36.120
the english department change how did the campus 
change okay i'm trying to kind of link changes to

30:36.100 --> 30:48.000
dates and i can't but uh

30:36.100 --> 30:48.000
when david stewart took over the headship he had 
this kind of notion of the department as promoting

30:47.980 --> 30:54.400
service prime as doing being a service department 
primarily and he saw uh as he put it cadres of

30:54.380 --> 31:01.300
instructors teaching technical writing and most 
of us didn't like this most of us thought this was a

31:01.280 --> 31:08.030
really bad idea and yet despite the fact that this 
was his vision it was under his leadership that
